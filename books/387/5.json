{"id":40838,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 Imprisoned","content":"CAPTAIN Holly Short of Section 8 followed the abductors to a Land Rover Discovery, and from there to the Ravenna ferry. Their captive had been transferred from a canvas sack into a stout golf bag, which was then topped off with the heads of several clubs. It was a very slick oper-ation. Three adult male humans and one teenage female. Holly was only mildly surprised to see that a young girl was involved. After all, Artemis Fowl was little more than a child and he managed to involve himself in far more complex plots than this.\n The Land Rover was returned to a Hertz rental in Italy, and from there the group took a first-class sleeper carriage on an overnight bullet train along the western coast. It made sense to travel by train. There was no need to pass the golf bag through an X-ray machine.\n Holly didn\u0027t need to worry about X-ray machines, or indeed any form of human security device. Wearing her Section 8 shimmer suit, she was invisible to any kind of ray the border police could throw at her. The only way to find a shielded fairy was to hit one accidentally with a stone, and even then you would probably only get an invisible smack on the ear for your trouble.\n Holly slipped into the sleeper carriage and deposited herself on an unused luggage rack over the girl\u0027s head. Below her, the three humans propped the golf bag against the table, and stared at it as if… as if there was a demon inside.\n Three men and one girl. It would be easy to take them. She could knock them out with her Neutrino, then get Foaly to send in some techs to do mind wipes. Holly was itching to free the poor demon. It would take mere seconds. The only thing stopping her was the voices in her head.\n One of those voices belonged to Foaly, the other to Artemis.\n \u0027Hold your position, Captain Short,\u0027 advised Foaly the centaur. \u0027We need to see how far this goes.\u0027\n Section 8 had become very interested in Holly\u0027s mission since the demon abduction. Foaly was keeping a dedicated line to her helmet open.\n Holly\u0027s helmet was soundproof, yet she was still nerv-ous talking in such close proximity to the targets. The trick in this situation is to train oneself to speak without any of the usual accompanying gestures. This is harder than it sounds.\n \u0027That poor demon will be terrified,\u0027 said Holly, lying perfectly still. \u0027I have to get it out of there.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Artemis sharply. \u0027You have to see the bigger picture, Holly. We have no idea how big this organization is, or how much they know about the fairy People.\u0027\n \u0027Not as much as you. Demons don\u0027t carry the fairy Book. They\u0027re not much for rules.\u0027\n \u0027At least you have something in common,\u0027 said Butler.\n \u0027I could use the mesmer on them,\u0027 Holly offered. The mesmer was one of the tricks in every fairy\u0027s magical bag. It was a siren\u0027s song that could have any human happily spilling his guts. \u0027That would make them tell me what they know.\u0027\n \u0027And only what they know,\u0027 Artemis pointed out. \u0027If I was running this organization, everyone would be told only what they needed to know. Nobody would know every-thing, except me, of course.\u0027\n Holly resisted the urge to thump something in frustra-tion. Artemis was right, of course. She had to hang back and see how this situation played out. They needed to spread their net as wide as possible in order to catch all the members of this group.\n \u0027I\u0027ll need back-up,\u0027 Holly whispered. \u0027How many agents can Section Eight spare?\u0027\n Foaly cleared his throat, but didn\u0027t answer.\n \u0027What is it, Foaly? What\u0027s going on down there?\u0027\n \u0027Ark Sool caught wind of the abduction.\u0027\n The mere mention of that gnome\u0027s name drove Holly\u0027s blood pressure up a few points. Commander Ark Sool was the reason she had quit the LEP in the first place.\n \u0027Sool! How did he find out about it so quickly?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s got a source somewhere in Section Eight. He called in Vinyaya. She had no option but to hand over all the facts.\u0027\n Holly groaned. Sool was the king of red tape. As the dwarfs said, he couldn\u0027t make a decision if he was holding a jug of water and his bum-flap was onjire.\n \u0027What\u0027s the word?\u0027\n \u0027Sool is going for damage limitation. The blast walls are up and overground missions have been cancelled. No further action pending a meeting of the Council. If the manure hits the air circulator, Sool isn\u0027t going to be the one taking the blame. Not on his own.\u0027\n \u0027Politics,\u0027 spat Holly. \u0027Sool only cares about his precious career. So you can\u0027t send me anyone?\u0027\n Foaly chose his words carefully. \u0027Not officially. And no one official. I mean, it would be impossible for anyone, a consultant, say, to get past the blast walls carrying some-thing you might need, if you see what I mean.\u0027\n Holly understood exactly what Foaly was trying to tell her.\n \u0027Ten four, Foaly. I\u0027m on my own. Officially.\u0027\n \u0027Exactly. As far as Commander Sool knows, you are simply shadowing the suspects. You are only to take action if they decide to go public. In that case your orders are, and I\u0027m quoting Sool here, \"to take the least complicated and most permanent course of action\".\u0027\n \u0027He means vaporize the demon?\u0027\n \u0027Sool didn\u0027t say that, but that\u0027s what he wants.\u0027\n Holly despised Sool more with every heartbeat. \u0027He can\u0027t order me to do that! Killing a fairy goes against every law in the Book. I won\u0027t do it.\u0027\n \u0027Sool knows he can\u0027t officially order you to use ter-minal force on a fairy. What he\u0027s doing here is making an unofficial recommendation. The kind that could have a major effect on your career. It\u0027s a tricky one, Holly. Best-case scenario, this all blows over somehow.\u0027\n Artemis voiced the opinion that they all held. \u0027That\u0027s not going to happen. This is no opportunistic snatch. We are dealing with an organized group that knew what they were after. These people were at Barcelona and now here. They have an agenda for their demon, and, unless they\u0027re military, I would bet it involves going public for large amounts of money. This will be bigger than the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot and theYeti all rolled into one.\u0027\n Foaly sighed. \u0027You\u0027re in a fix, Holly. The best thing that could happen for you right now would be a nice non-lethal injury to take you out of the game.\u0027\n Holly remembered her old mentor\u0027s words. It\u0027s not about what\u0027s best for us, Julius Root had told her once. It\u0027s about what\u0027s best For the People.\n \u0027Sometimes it\u0027s not about us, Foaly. I\u0027ll figure this out somehow. I do have help, right?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 confirmed the centaur. \u0027It\u0027s not as if it\u0027s the first time we\u0027ve saved the fairy world.\u0027\n Foaly\u0027s confident tones made Holly feel better, even if he was hundreds of miles underground.\n Artemis interrupted them. \u0027You two can swap war stories later. We can\u0027t afford to miss a word that these people say. If we can beat them to their destination, it could be an advantage.\"\n Artemis was right. This was not a time for drifting. Holly ran a quick systems check on her helmet instru-ments, then pointed her visor at the humans below.\n \u0027You getting this, Foaly?\u0027 she asked.\n \u0027Clear as crystal. Did I tell you about my new gas screens?\u0027\n Artemis\u0027s sigh rattled through the speakers.\n \u0027Yes, you did. Now be quiet, centaur. We\u0027re on a mission, remember.\u0027\n \u0027Whatever you say, Mud Boy. Hey, look, your girlfriend is saying something.\u0027\n Artemis had a vast mental reserve of scathing come-backs at his disposal, but none of them covered girlfriend insults. He wasn\u0027t even sure if it was an insult. And if it was, who was being insulted? Him or the girl?\n The girl spoke French as only a native could.\n \u0027Technically,\u0027 she said, \u0027the only crime we are guilty of is fare-dodging, and perhaps not even that. Legally speak-ing, how can you kidnap something that is not supposed to exist? I doubt anyone ever accused Murray Gell-Mann of kidnapping a quark, even though he knowingly carried a billion of them around in his pocket.\u0027 The girl chuckled gently, causing her glasses to slip down again.\n No one else laughed, except an eavesdropping Irish boy two hundred miles away at Fontanarossa International Airport, about to board the last Alitalia flight to Rome. Rome, Artemis reasoned, would be a lot more central than Sicily. Wherever the demon was headed, Artemis could get there faster if he flew from Rome.\n \u0027That wasn\u0027t bad,\u0027 Artemis commented, then relayed the joke to Butler. \u0027Obviously there are differences in the scenarios, but it\u0027s a joke, not a quantum physics lecture.\u0027\n Butler\u0027s left eyebrow cranked up like a drawbridge. \u0027Differences in the scenarios, that\u0027s just what I was thinking.\u0027\n Back on board the bullet train, one of the men, the one with the miraculously healed leg, shifted on the leatherette upholstery.\n \u0027What time do we get into Nice, Minerva?\u0027 he said.\n This single sentence was a goldmine of information for the listening Artemis. Firstly, the girl\u0027s name was Minerva, named presumably for the Roman goddess of wisdom. So far, a very apt name indeed. Secondly, their destination was Nice in the south of France. And thirdly, this girl seemed to be in charge. Extraordinary.\n The girl, who had been smiling still at her quark joke, switched to irritated mode.\n \u0027No names, remember? There are ears everywhere. If a single person uncovers a single detail of our plan, every-thing we have worked for could be ruined.\u0027\n Too late, Mud Girl, thought Captain Holly Short, from her luggage rack. Artemis Fowl already knows too much about you. Not to mention my own little guardian angel, Foaly.\n Holly snapped a close-up of the girl\u0027s face.\n \u0027We have a mugshot and a first name, Foaly. Is that enough for you?\u0027\n \u0027Should be,\u0027 replied the centaur. \u0027I got stills of the males too. Give me a while to run them through my database.\u0027\n Below her, the second man from Barcelona unzipped the fake top from the golf bag.\n \u0027I should check on my clubs,\u0027 he said. \u0027See if they\u0027re settled OK. If they\u0027ve started to move about, I might put in something to keep them still.\u0027\n All of which would have been a perfectly acceptable code, had there not been a camera pointed right at them.\n The man reached into the bag, and after a moment\u0027s feeling around, he pulled out a small arm and checked the pulse.\n \u0027Fine. Everything\u0027s fine.\u0027\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027Now, you should get some sleep. We have a long journey ahead of us. I will stay awake for a while, because I feel like reading. The next person can read in four hours.\u0027\n The three men nodded, but nobody lay down. They just sat there, staring at the golf bag, as if there were a demon in there.\n Artemis and Butler picked up a lucky connection to Nice with Air France and by ten they had checked into the Hotel Negresco and were enjoying coffee and croissants on the Promenade des Anglais.\n Holly was not so lucky. She was still perched on a luggage rack on board a train. Not the same luggage rack. This was her third rack altogether. First they had to change in Rome, then again in Monte Carlo and now finally they were headed for Nice.\n Artemis was speaking into his little finger which trans-mitted the vibrations to the fairy phone in his palm.\n \u0027Any hints as to the exact final destination?\"\n \u0027Nothing yet,\u0027 replied a tired and irritated Holly. \u0027This girl is controlling the adults with a rod of iron. They\u0027re afraid to say anything. I am sick of lying on this rack. I feel like I have been lying on racks for a year. What are you two doing?\u0027\n Artemis put his decaf cappuccino down gently, so as not to rattle the saucer. \u0027We\u0027re at the Nice Library, trying to dig up anything on this Minerva person. Perhaps we can find out if she has a villa near here.\u0027\n \u0027Glad to hear it,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027I had visions of you two drinking tea at the beach, while I sweat it out here.\u0027\n Six metres from where Artemis was sitting, waves swirled along the beach like emerald paint poured from a bucket.\n \u0027Tea? At the beach? No time for luxuries, Holly. There is important work to be done.\u0027 He winked at Butler.\n \u0027Are you sure you\u0027re at the library? I thought I heard water.\u0027\n Artemis smiled, enjoying the exchange. \u0027Water? Surely not. The only thing flowing here is information.\u0027\n \u0027Are you grinning, Artemis? For some reason I get the feeling that you\u0027re wearing that smug smile of yours.\u0027\n Foaly cut into the line. \u0027Pay dirt, Holly. It took a while, but we tracked down our mystery girl.\u0027\n Artemis\u0027s smile vanished. All business now. \u0027Who is she, Foaly? To be honest I am amazed that I don\u0027t already know her.\u0027\n \u0027The girl is Minerva Paradizo, twelve years old, born in Cagnes sur Mer, South of France. The bespectacled man is her father. Gaspard Paradizo. Fifty-two. Cosmetic surgeon, of Brazilian descent. One more child, a boy, Beau, five years old. The mother left a year ago. Lives in Marseille with the ex-gardener.\u0027\n Artemis was puzzled. \u0027Gaspard Paradizo is a cosmetic surgeon? Why did it take so long to find these two? There must have been records, pictures.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s just it. There were no pictures on the Net. Not even a local paper snapshot. I got the feeling that some-body had systematically wiped out every e-trace of this family they could find.\u0027\n \u0027But nobody can hide from you, eh, Foaly?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. I ran a deep probe and came across a ghost image on a French TV archive page. Minerva Paradizo won a national spelling bee when she was four. Once I had the name, then it was easy to retrieve all the other wipes. Your girlfriend is quite something, Artemis. She has already completed high school, and is currently studying for two distance learning degrees. Quantum physics and psychol-ogy. I suspect that she also has a doctorate in chemistry under an assumed name.\u0027\n \u0027What about the other two men?\u0027 asked Holly, moving the conversation on before Foaly could get in another girl-friend crack.\n \u0027The Latin one is Juan Soto. Head of Soto Security. He seems to be a legitimate security operative. Not much expertise, hardly any training. Nothing to worry about.\u0027\n \u0027And the sniper?\u0027\n \u0027The crutch guy is Billy Kong. A real nasty piece of work. I\u0027m sending the file to your helmet.\u0027 In seconds the mail alert dinged in Holly\u0027s ear and she opened the file in her visor. A three-dimensional photo of Kong revolved slowly in the top left corner of the visor, while his crimi-nal record scrolled down before her eyes.\n Artemis cleared his throat. \u0027I don\u0027t happen to have a helmet, Foaly.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes, little Master Lo-tech,\u0027 said Foaly, his voice drip-ping with condescension. \u0027Shall I read it for you?\u0027\n \u0027If your mighty brain can bear to use simple vocaliz-ation.\u0027\n \u0027OK. Billy Kong. Grew up in a circus, lost an eye in a fight with a tiger…\u0027\n Artemis sighed. \u0027Please, Foaly, we don\u0027t have time for jokes.\u0027\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 retorted the centaur. \u0027Like you\u0027re in the library. OK then, the truth. Born Jonah Lee, Malibu, early seven-ties. Family originally from Taiwan. Mother Annie. One older brother, Eric, killed in a gang fight. The mother moved them both back to Hsinchu, south of Taipei. Kong moved to the city and became a petty thief. He had to leave in the nineties when a row with an accomplice turned into a murder charge. Kong used a kitchen knife on his friend. There\u0027s still a warrant out for him there, under the name Jonah Lee.\u0027\n Holly was surprised. Kong seemed harmless enough. He was a slight man with spiked, highlighted hair. He seemed more like a member of a boy band than a close-up man.\n \u0027Moved to Paris and changed his name,\u0027 continued Foaly.\n \u0027Took up martial arts. He\u0027s had facial surgery, but not enough to escape my computer.\u0027\n Artemis lowered his phone hand and talked to Butler. \u0027Billy Kong?\u0027\n The bodyguard drew a sharp breath. \u0027Dangerous man. He has a small well-trained crew. They hire themselves out as bodyguards to people who live dangerously. I heard he went legit and was working for a doctor in Europe.\u0027\n \u0027Kong is on the train,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027He was the man with the fake crutch.\u0027\n Butler nodded thoughtfully. Kong was infamous in underworld circles. The man had no morals, and would happily perform any task, however distasteful, for the right price. Kong only had one rule: never quit until the job is done.\n \u0027If Billy Kong is involved, things just got a lot more dangerous. We need to rescue that demon as quickly as possible.\u0027\n \u0027Agreed,\u0027 said Artemis, raising the phone. \u0027Do we have an address, Foaly?\u0027\n \u0027Gaspard Paradizo owns a chateau on theVence side of Tourrettes sur Loup, twenty minutes from Nice.\u0027\n Artemis finished his cappuccino in a single draught. \u0027Very well. Holly, we shall meet you there.\u0027\n Artemis stood, straightening his suit jacket. \u0027Butler, old friend, we need some surveillance equipment. Do you know anybody in Nice who might oblige?\u0027\n Butler flipped open a wafer-thin mobile phone. \u0027What do you think?\u0027\n TOURRETTES SUR LOUP, SOUTHERN FRANCE\n Tourrettes sur Loup is a small artisans\u0027 village perched on the lower slopes of the Alpes Maritimes. The Paradizo chateau was further up the slopes, on a flattened peak below the snowline.\n The chateau was originally nineteenth century but had undergone extensive renovation. The walls were solid stone, the windows were reflective and probably bullet-proof, and there were cameras every where. The road lead-ing to the chateau was typical of the region: narrow and tightly looped. There was an observation tower on the building\u0027s southern corner which afforded any sentry a 360-degree view of any avenue of approach. Several men patrolled the grounds close to the main building and the gardens were dotted with grassy dunes, but did not provide a shred of cover.\n Artemis and Butler were concealed in a line of bushes on the adjacent slope. Butler studied the chateau through high-powered binoculars.\n \u0027You certainly can pick them,\u0027 noted the bodyguard. \u0027I think I saw this place in a Bond movie once.\u0027\n \u0027No problem for you, surely?\u0027\n Butler frowned. \u0027I\u0027m a bodyguard, Artemis. A human bulletproof vest. Breaking into fortified castles is not my speciality.\u0027\n \u0027You have rescued me from more secure locations than this one.\u0027\n \u0027True,\u0027 agreed the bodyguard. \u0027But I had intel, an inside man. Or I was desperate. If I had to walk away from here, it wouldn\u0027t trouble me unduly, so long as you were walk-ing away with me.\u0027\n Artemis patted his arm. \u0027We can\u0027t walk away, old friend.\u0027\n Butler sighed. \u0027I suppose not.\u0027 He handed Artemis the binoculars. \u0027Now, start at the western corner and sweep east.\u0027\n Artemis raised the binoculars to his eyes, then adjusted the focus.\n \u0027I see two-man patrols.\u0027\n \u0027Soto\u0027s private security company. No weapons showing, but they have bulges below their jackets. Basic training, I imagine. But with more than twenty of them on and around the premises it would be very difficult to overpower them all. And even if I did, the local police would be here in minutes.\u0027\n Artemis moved the binoculars a few degrees. \u0027I see a little boy wearing a cowboy hat driving a toy car.\u0027\n \u0027Paradizo\u0027s son, Beau, presumably. Nobody pays much attention to him. Move on.\u0027\n \u0027Sensors in the eaves?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve actually researched that particular model. The very latest sealed security pods. Closed circuit, infrared, motion sensors, night vision. The works. I\u0027ve been meaning to upgrade Fowl Manor.\u0027\n There were small speakers on spikes dotted around the chateau.\n \u0027A sound system?\u0027\n Butler snorted. \u0027I wish. Those are waffle boxes. They transmit interference. Our directional microphones are useless here. I doubt even Foaly could pick up anything inside that building.\u0027\n Holly shimmered into visibility beside them. \u0027You\u0027re right. He\u0027s pulled one of our shrouded satellites out of orbit to get a look at this place, but it\u0027s going to be several hours before the chateau is inside its footprint.\u0027\n Butler took his hand off his gun butt. \u0027Holly, I wish you wouldn\u0027t appear like that. I\u0027m a bodyguard. I get jumpy.\u0027\n Holly smiled, punching him on the leg. \u0027I know, big man. That\u0027s why I do it. Think of me as on-the-job train-ing.\u0027\n Artemis barely glanced up from the binoculars. \u0027We need to find out what\u0027s happening in there. If only we could get a man inside.\u0027\n Holly frowned. \u0027I can\u0027t go into a human dwelling with-out per mission. You know the rules. If a fairy enters a human dwelling without an invitation, they lose their magic, and that\u0027s after a few hours of painful vomiting and cramps.\u0027\n After the battles atTaillte, Frond, the king of the fairy People, had tried to keep mischievous fairies away from human dwellings by imposing magical geasa or rules on fairies. He had used his warlocks to construct a powerful spell to impose his will. Anyone attempting to break these rules would become deathly ill and lose their magic. Now, the spell was fading with time, but it was still strong enough to cause nausea and a dimming of the sparks of magic.\n \u0027What about Butler? You could lend him a sheet of Foaly\u0027s cam foil. He\u0027d be as good as invisible.\u0027\n Holly shook her head. \u0027There\u0027s a laser pyramid all over the grounds. Even with cam foil, Butler would break the beams.\u0027\n \u0027Mulch then? He\u0027s a criminal, long past the allergic re-action stage. Cramps and vomiting wouldn\u0027t affect him.\u0027\n Holly scanned the grounds with her X-ray filter. \u0027This place is built on solid rock, and the walls are a metre thick, Mulch could never burrow in there unnoticed.\u0027 Her X-ray vision fell on the skeleton of a small boy driving his little electric car. She raised her visor to see Beau Paradizo zigzag-ging through the guards unmolested.\n \u0027Mulch couldn\u0027t get in there,\u0027 she said, smiling. \u0027But I think I know someone who could.\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/211.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
