{"id":40835,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2 Doodah Day","content":"haven city, the lower elementsHOLLY Short\u0027s career as an elfin private investigator was not working out as well as she\u0027d hoped. This was mainly because the LowerElements\u0027mostpopularcurrent events show had run not one, but two specials on her over the past few months. It was difficult to go undercover when her face was forever popping up on cable reruns. \u0027Surgery?\u0027 suggested a voice in her head. This voice was not the first sign of madness; it was her partner, Mulch Diggums, communicating from his mike to her earpiece.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 she said, her voice carrying to her own micro-phone, a tiny flesh-coloured chip glued to her throat.\\n\\n I m looking at a poster of your famous face, and I\u0027m thinking that you should have some cosmetic surgery if we want to stay in business. And I mean real business, not this bounty-hunting game. Bounty hunters are the lowest of the low.\u0027\\n\\n Holly sighed. Her dwarf partner was right. Even crim-inals were considered more trustworthy than bounty hunters.\\n\\n \u0027A few implants and a reshaped nose and even your best friend wouldn\u0027t recognize you,\u0027 continued Mulch Diggums. \u0027It\u0027s not as if you\u0027re a beauty queen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forget it,\u0027 said Holly. She was fond of the face she had. It reminded her of her mother\u0027s.\\n\\n \u0027What about a skin spray? You could go green, disguise yourself as a sprite.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mulch? Are you in position?\u0027 snapped Holly.\\n\\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 came the dwarf\u0027s reply. \u0027Any sign of the pixie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, he\u0027s not up and about yet, but he will be soon. So stop the chatter and just get ready.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey, we\u0027re partners now. No more criminal and police officer. I don\u0027t have to take orders from you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get ready, please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No problem. Mulch Diggums, lowlife bounty hunter, signing off.\u0027\\n\\n Holly sighed. Sometimes she missed the discipline of the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance Division. When an order was given, it was followed. Although if she was honest, Holly had to admit she had got herself into trouble more than once for disobeying a direct command.\\n\\n She had only survived in LEPrecon for as long as she had because of a few high-profile arrests. And because of her mentor, Commander Julius Root.\\n\\n Holly felt her heart lurch as she remembered, for the thousandth time, that Julius was dead. She could go for hours without thinking about it, then it would hit her. Every time like the first time.\\n\\n She had quit the LEP because Julius\u0027s replacement had actually accused her of murdering the Commander. Holly figured with a boss like that, she could do the fairy People ignore good outside the system. It was starting to look like she had been dead wrong. In her time as LEPrecon Captain she had been involved in putting down a goblin revolution, thwarting a plan to expose the subterranean fairy culture to the humans and reclaiming stolen fairy tech-Jiology from a Mud Man in Chicago. Now she was track-ing a fish smuggler who had skipped out on his bail. Not exactly national security stuff.\\n\\n \u0027What about shin extensions?\u0027 said Mulch, interrupting her thoughts. \u0027You could be taller in hours.\u0027\\n\\n Holly smiled. As irritating as her partner was, he could always cheer her up. Also, as a dwarf, Mulch had special talents which came in very handy in their new line of business. Until recently, he had used these skills to break into houses and out of prisons, but now he was on the side of the angels, or so he swore. Unfortunately, all fairies knew that a dwarf\u0027s vow to a non-dwarf wasn\u0027t worth the spit-sodden handshake that sealed the deal.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe you could get a brain extension,\u0027 Holly retorted.\\n\\n Mulch chortled. \u0027Oh, brilliant. I must write that one down in my witty retorts book.\u0027\\n\\n Holly was trying to come up with an actual witty retort, when their target appeared at the motel-room door. He was a harmless-looking pixie, barely half a metre high, but you didn\u0027t have to be tall to drive a lorry of fish. The smug-gling bosses hired pixies as drivers and couriers because they looked so innocent and childlike. Holly had read this pixie\u0027s jacket, and she knew that he was anything but innocent.\\n\\n Doodah Day had been smuggling livestock to illegal restaurants for over a century. In smuggling circles he was something of a legend. As an ex-criminal, Mulch was privy to criminal folklore and was able to supply Holly with all kinds of useful information that wouldn\u0027t find its way into an LEP report. For instance, Doodah had once made the heavily patrolled Atlantis—Haven run in under six hours without losing a fish from the tank.\\n\\n Doodah had been arrested in the Atlantis Trench by a squad of LEP water sprites. He had skipped out en route from a holding cell to the courthouse, and now Holly had tracked him here. The bounty on Doodah Day was enough to pay six months\u0027 rent on their office. The plaque on the door read: Short and Diggums. Private Investigators.\\n\\n Doodah Day stepped out of his room, scowling at the world in general. He zipped his jacket then headed south towards the shopping district. Holly stayed twenty steps back, hiding her face underneath a hood. This street had traditionally been a rough spot, but the Council were putting millions of ingots into a major revamp. In five years, there would be no more goblin ghetto. Huge yellow multi-mixers were chewing up old sidewalk and laying down brand-new paths behind them. Overhead, public service sprites unhooked burned-out sunstrips from the tunnel ceiling and replaced them with new molecule models. , The pixie followed the same route that he had for the past three days. He strolled down the road to the nearest plaza, picked up a carton of vole curry at a kiosk, then bought a ticket to the twenty-four-hour movie theatre. If be stayed true to form, then Doodah would be in there for at least eight hours.\\n\\n Not if I can help it, thought Holly. She was determined to get this case wrapped by close of business. It wouldn\u0027t be easy. Doodah was small, but he was fast. Without weapons or restraints, it would be almost impossible to contain him. Almost impossible, but there was a way.\\n\\n Holly bought a ticket from the gnome attendant, then settled into a seat two rows behind the target. The theatre \"Was pretty quiet at this time of day. There were maybe fifty patrons besides themselves. Most of them weren\u0027t even \"Wearing theatre goggles. This was just somewhere to put in a few hours between meals.\\n\\n The theatre was running The Hill of Tailke trilogy non-stop. The trilogy told a cinematic version of the events surrounding the Hill of Taillte battle, where the humans had finally forced the fairies underground. The final part of the trilogy had cleaned up at the AMP awards a couple of years ago. The effects were splendid and there was even a special edition interactive version, where the player could become one of the minor characters.\\n\\n Looking at the movie now, Holly felt the same pang of loss as she always did. The People should be living above ground, instead they were stuck in this technologically advanced cave.\\n\\n Holly watched the sweeping aerial views and slow-motion battles for forty minutes, then she moved into the aisle and threw off her hood. In her LEP days she would simply have come up behind the pixie and stuck her Neutrino 3000 in his back, but civilians were not allowed to carry weapons of any kind, and so a more subtle strat-egy would have to be employed.\\n\\n She called the pixie from the aisle.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, you. Aren\u0027t you Doodah Day?\u0027\\n\\n The pixie jumped from his seat, which did not make him any taller. He fixed his fiercest scowl on his features and threw it Holly\u0027s way. \u0027Who wants to know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The LEP,\u0027 replied Holly. Technically she had not identified herself as a member of the LEP, which would be impersonating a police officer.\\n\\n Doodah squinted at her. \u0027I know you. You\u0027re that female elf. The one who tackled the goblins. I\u0027ve seen you on digital. You\u0027re not LEP any more.\u0027\\n\\n Holly felt her heartbeat speed up. It was good to be back in action. Any kind of action.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe not, Doodah, but I\u0027m still here to bring you in. Are you going to come quietly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And spend a few centuries in the Atlantis pen? What do you think?\u0027 said Doodah Day, dropping to his knees.\\n\\n The little pixie was gone like a stone from a sling, crawl-ing under the seats, jinking left and right.\\n\\n Holly pulled up her hood and ran towards the fire exit. That\u0027s where Doodah would be going. He went this way every day. Every good criminal checks the exit routes in whatever building he visits.\\n\\n Doodah was at the exit before her, crashing through the door like a dog through a hatch. All Holly could see was the blue blur of his jumpsuit.\\n\\n \u0027Target on the move,\u0027 she said, knowing her throat mike would pick up whatever she said. \u0027Coming your way.\u0027\\n\\n I hope, thought Holly, but she didn\u0027t say it.\\n\\n In theory Doodah would make for his bolt-hole, a small storage unit over on Crystal, which was kitted out with a small cot and air-conditioning unit. When the pixie got there, Mulch would be waiting. It was a classic human hunt-ing technique. Beat the grass and be ready when the bird flies. Of course, if you were human, you shot the bird then ate it. Mulch\u0027s method of capture was less terminal, but equally revolting.\\n\\n Holly stuck close, but not too close. She could hear the pitter-patter of the pixie\u0027s tiny feet scurrying along the theatre\u0027s carpet, but she couldn\u0027t see the little fellow. She didn\u0027t want to see him. It was vital that Doodah believed he had got away, otherwise he wouldn\u0027t make for his bolt-hole. In her LEP days there would have been no need for this kind of close-up pursuit. She would have had complete access to five thousand surveillance cameras dotted throughout Haven, not to mention a hundred other gadgets and gimmicks from the LEP surveillance arsenal. Now there was just her and Mulch. Four eyes and some special dwarf talents.\\n\\n The main door was still flapping when Holly reached it. Just inside, an outraged gnome was flat on his behind, covered with nettle smoothie.\\n\\n \u0027A little kid,\u0027 he complained to an usher. \u0027Or a pixie. It had a big head, I know that much. Hit me right in the gut.\u0027\\n\\n Holly skirted the pair, shouldering her way on to the plaza outside. Outside, relatively speaking. Everything was inside when you lived in a tunnel. Overhead, the sunstrips were set to mid-morning. She could trace Doodah\u0027s progress by the trail of chaos in his wake. The vole kiosk was overturned. Lumpy grey-green curry congealed on the flagstones. And lumpy grey-green footsteps led to the plaza\u0027s northern corner. So far, Doodah was behaving very predictably.\\n\\n Holly shouldered through the ragged line of curry customers, keeping her eyes on the pixie\u0027s footsteps.\\n\\n \u0027Two minutes,\u0027 she said, for Mulch\u0027s benefit.\\n\\n There was no reply, but there shouldn\u0027t be, not if the dwarf was in position.\\n\\n Doodah should take the next service alley and cut across to Crystal. Next time they were going after a gnome. Pixies were too fast. The fairy Council did not really like bounty hunters and tried to make life as difficult for them as pos-sible. There was no such thing as a licensed firearm outside the LEP. Anyone with a weapon, without a badge, was going to prison.\\n\\n Holly rounded the corner expecting to see the tail end of a pixie blur. Instead she saw a ten-tonne yellow multi-mixer bearing down on her. Obviously Doodah Day had finished being predictable.\\n\\n \u0027D\u0027Arvit!\u0027 swore Holly, diving to one side. The multi-mixer\u0027s front rotor chewed through the plaza\u0027s paving, spit-ting it out at the rear in centimetre-perfect slabs.\\n\\n She rolled into a crouch, reaching for the Neutrino blaster, which had been on her hip until recently. All she found was air.\\n\\n The multimixer was swinging round for a second run, bucking and hissing like a mechanical Jurassic carnivore. Giant pistons thumped, and rotor blades carved scythe-like through whatever surface fell beneath their blades. Debris was shovelled into the machine\u0027s belly, to be processed and shaped by heated plates.\\n\\n It reminds me a bit of Mulch, thought Holly. Funny what crosses your mind when your life is in danger.\\n\\n She back-pedalled away from the mixer. Yes, it was big, but it was slow and unwieldy. Holly glanced upwards to the cab, and there was Doodah, expertly manipulating the gears. His hands flashed across the knobs and levers, drag-ging the metal behemoth towards Holly.\\n\\n All around was pandemonium. Shoppers howling, emer-gency klaxons sounding. But Holly couldn\u0027t worry about that now. Priority one: stay alive. Terrifying as this situa-tion might be to the general public, Holly had years of LEP training and experience. She\u0027d escaped the grasp of far quicker enemies than this multimixer.\\n\\n As it turned out, Holly was mistaken. The multimixer was slow as a whole, but some of its parts were lightning fast. For example, the containment paddles, two three-metre high walls of steel that slotted out on either side of the front rotor to contain any debris that might be thrown up by the rotor blades.\\n\\n Doodah Day, an instinctive driver of any vehicle, saw his opportunity and took it. He overrode the safety and deployed the paddles. Four pneumatic pumps instantly pressurized and literally blew the paddles into the wall on both sides of Holly. They bit deep, sinking fifteen centi-metres into the stone.\\n\\n Holly\u0027s confidence drained down into her boots. She was trapped with a hundred curved strip blades tearing up the ground before her.\\n\\n \u0027Wings,\u0027 said Holly, but only her LEP suit had wings, and she had given up the right to wear that.\\n\\n The paddles contained the vortex created by the blades and turned it back on itself. The vibration was terrific. Holly felt her teeth shake in her gums. She could see ten of everything. Her whole world was bad reception. Beneath her feet the blades greedily chewed the pavement. Holly jumped at the left-hand paddle, but it was well lubricated and afforded her no purchase. Her luck was equally bad with the other paddle. The only other possible avenue was straight ahead, and that wasn\u0027t really an option, not with the deadly rotor waiting.\\n\\n Holly shouted at Doodah, maybe her mouth formed actual words. She couldn\u0027t be certain, not with the shak-ing and the noise. Blades snicked through the air, grabbing for her. With each pass they tore strips from the ground beneath her feet. There wasn\u0027t much ground left. Soon she would be feeding the multimixer. She would be shredded, passed through the machine\u0027s innards and finally laid as a paving slab. Holly Short would literally be part of the city.\\n\\n There was nothing to do. Nothing. Mulch was too far away to be of any assistance, and it wasn\u0027t likely that any civilian would attempt to mount a rogue mixer, even if they had known she was trapped between the paddles.\\n\\n As the blades closed in, Holly gazed towards the computer-generated sky. It would have been nice to die on the surface. Feeling the heat of the real sun warming her brow. It would have been nice.\\n\\n Then the rotor stopped. Holly was sprayed with a shower of half-digested debris from the mixer\u0027s stomach. A few stone slivers scratched her skin, but that was the extent of her injury.\\n\\n Holly wiped the grime from her face and looked up. Her ears rang with the engine\u0027s aftershock, and her eyes watered from the dust that settled on her like dirty snow.\\n\\n Doodah peered down at her from the cab. His face was pale but fierce.\\n\\n \u0027Leave me alone!\u0027 he shouted. His voice seemed weak and tinny to Holly\u0027s damaged eardrums.\\n\\n \u0027Just leave me alone!\u0027\\n\\n And he was gone, scurrying down the access ladder, maybe heading for his bolt-hole.\\n\\n Holly leaned against one of the paddles, allowing herself a moment to recover. Tiny sparks of magic blossomed on her many cuts, sealing them. Her ears popped, whined and flexed as the magic automatically targeted her eardrums. In seconds, Holly\u0027s hearing was back to normal.\\n\\n She had to get out of here. And there was only one way. Over the rotor. Past the blades. Holly tipped one gingerly with a finger. A droplet of blood oozed from a tiny cut, only to be sucked back in by a blue spark of magic. Those blades would cut her to ribbons if she slipped, and there wouldn\u0027t be enough magic under the world to stitch her back together again. But the rotor was her only way out, otherwise she would have to sit it out here until LEP traffic arrived. It would be bad enough causing this kind of damage with the weight of LEP public liability insurance behind her, but as a freelancer she\u0027d probably be thrown in jail for a couple of months while the courts decided what to charge her with.\\n\\n Holly threaded her fingers between the blades, gripping the first bar on the rotor. It would be just like climbing a ladder. A very sharp, potentially fatal ladder. She stepped on a lower bar and boosted herself up. The rotor groaned and dropped fifteen centimetres. Holly held on, because it was safer than letting go. Blades quivered two centimetres from her limbs. Slow and steady. No false moves.\\n\\n One bar at a time, Holly climbed the rotor. Twice a blade nicked her flesh, but the wounds were not serious and were quickly sealed by blue sparks. After a brief eter-nity of utter concentration, Holly pulled herself on to the hood. The bonnet was filthy and hot, but at least it wasn\u0027t sharper than a centaur\u0027s tongue.\\n\\n \u0027He went that way,\u0027 said a voice from ground level.\\n\\n Holly looked down to see a large frowning gnome in a city services uniform pointing towards Crystal.\\n\\n \u0027He went that way,\u0027 repeated the gnome. \u0027The pixie who threw me out of my mixer.\u0027\\n\\n Holly stared at the burly public services guy. \u0027That tiny pixie threw you out?\u0027\\n\\n The gnome almost blushed. \u0027I was getting out anyway, he just tipped me over.\u0027 He suddenly forgot all about his embarrassment. \u0027Hey, aren\u0027t you Polly something? Polly Little? That\u0027s it. The LEP hero.\u0027\\n\\n Holly climbed down the cab ladder. \u0027Polly Little. That\u0027s me.\u0027\\n\\n Holly landed running, her boots crunching on pebbles of crushed pavement.\\n\\n \u0027Mulch,\u0027 she said. \u0027Doodah is coming your way. Be care-ful. He\u0027s a lot more dangerous than we thought.\u0027\\n\\n Dangerous? Maybe, maybe not. He hadn\u0027t killed her when he\u0027d had the chance. It would seem that the pixie had no stomach for murder.\\n\\n Doodah\u0027s stunt with the multimixer had caused chaos in the plaza. Traffic police, nicknamed Wheelies, were pour-ing in and civilians were pouring out. Holly counted at least six LEPtraffic magna-bikes and two cruisers. She was keeping her head down, when one of the traffic officers hopped off his bike and grabbed her shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Did you see what happened, missy?\u0027\\n\\n Missy? Holly was tempted to twist the hand on her shoul-der and flip the officer into a nearby recycler. But this was not the time for outrage — she needed to redirect his attention.\\n\\n \u0027Why,thankgoodnessyou\u0027rehere,Officer,\u0027she twittered in a voice at least an octave higher than her normal tones. \u0027Over there, by the multimixer.There\u0027s blood every-where.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Blood!\u0027 exclaimed the Wheelie, delighted to hear it. \u0027Everywhere?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely everywhere.\u0027\\n\\n The traffic cop dropped Holly\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Thank you, missy. I\u0027ll handle it from here.\u0027\\n\\n He strode purposefully towards the multimixer, then turned back.\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me, missy,\u0027 he said, recognition glimmering in his eye, just out of reach. \u0027Don\u0027t I know you?\u0027\\n\\n But the hooded elf had disappeared.\\n\\n Ah well, thought the Wheelie. I should probably go look at the blood everywhere.\\n\\n Holly ran towards Crystal Street, though she felt sure there was no need for haste. Doodah had either decided that there was too much heat on him to reveal his bolt-hole, or Mulch had him. Either way it was out of her control. Once again, she lamented the loss of LEP back-up. In her Recon days, all it would have taken was a quick order into her helmet microphone, and every street in the area would be cordoned off.\\n\\n She skirted a street-cleaning robot, turning on to Crystal. The narrow street was a service lane for the main shopping plaza, and consisted mostly of delivery bays. The rest of the units were rented out for storage. Holly was 32\\n\\n surprised to find Doodah directly in front of her, rummag-ing in his pocket, presumably for the access chip to his unit. Something must have held him up for a minute. Maybe he had ducked behind a crate to avoid the Wheelies. Whatever. She had another shot at him.\\n\\n Doodah looked up, and all Holly could do was wave.\\n\\n \u0027Morning,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Doodah shook a tiny fist at her. \u0027Don\u0027t you have better things to do, elf? All I do is smuggle a few fish.\u0027\\n\\n The question cut Holly deeply. Was this really the best way to help the People? Surely Commander Root had wanted more from her? In the past few months she had gone from top priority surface operations, to chasing down fish smugglers in a back alley. That was quite a drop.\\n\\n She showed Doodah her hands. \u0027I don\u0027t want you to get hurt, so stand perfectly still.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah chuckled. \u0027Hurt? By you? Not likely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Not by me. By him.\u0027 She pointed at the patch of mud under Doodah\u0027s feet.\\n\\n \u0027Him?\u0027 Doodah looked down suspiciously, suspecting a trap. His suspicions were absolutely correct. The ground beneath his feet fizzled slightly as the surface earth shiv-ered and bounced.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Doodah, lifting one foot. He would doubt-less have stepped off the patch, if he\u0027d had time. But what happened next, happened very quickly.\\n\\n The ground did more than just collapse, it was sucked from below Doodah with a sickening slurping sound. A hoop of teeth cut through the earth, followed by a huge mouth. There was a dwarf on the other end of the mouth, and he breached the ground like a dolphin jumping, driven apparently by gas from his rear end. The ring of teeth closed round Doodah, swallowing him to the neck.\\n\\n Mulch Diggums, for of course it was he, settled back into his tunnel, taking the unfortunate pixie with him. Doodah, it has to be said, did not look quite so cocky as he had a second ago.\\n\\n \u0027A d-dwarf,\u0027 he stammered. \u0027I thought your People didn\u0027t like the law.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Generally they don\u0027t. But Mulch is an exception. You don\u0027t mind if he doesn\u0027t answer you himself; he might acci-dentally bite your head off.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah squirmed suddenly. \u0027What\u0027s he doing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I imagine he\u0027s licking you. Dwarf spittle hardens on contact with air. As soon as he opens his mouth, you\u0027ll be locked up tight as a chick in an egg.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch winked at Holly. It was about as much as he could gloat at the moment, but Holly knew that he would spend the next several days boasting about his skills.\\n\\n Dwarfs can tunnel through kilometres of earth. Dwarfs have jet-powered rear ends. Dwarfs can produce two litres of rock spit-tle every hour. What have you got? Besides a famous face that keeps blowing our cover?\\n\\n Holly peered into the hole, the toe of one boot hooked over the edge. \u0027OK, partner. Good job. Now, can you please spit out the fugitive.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch was happy to oblige. He hawked Doodah on to the lane\u0027s surface, then clambered up himself, rehingeing his jaw.\\n\\n \u0027This is disgusting,\u0027 moaned Doodah, as the viscous spit-tle solidified on his limbs. \u0027It stinks too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 said Mulch, injured. \u0027The smell is not my fault. If you rented storage in a cleaner lane…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yeah, stinky? Well, this is what I think of you.\u0027 Doodah attempted a pixie hex gesture, but fortunately the rock spittle froze his arm before he could complete it.\\n\\n \u0027OK, you two. Cut it out,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027We have thirty minutes to get this little guy to the LEP before the spittle loosens up.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch peered over her shoulder towards the mouth of the lane. He turned suddenly pale underneath his coating of wet earth, and his beard hair bristled nervously.\\n\\n \u0027You know something, partner,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to need thirty minutes.\u0027\\n\\n Holly turned away from her prisoner. There were half a dozen elves blocking the entrance to the lane. They were LEP, or something very like it. They wore plain clothes with no markings or insignia of any kind. They were official, though. The heavy artillery cradled in their elbows attested to that. Holly noticed with some relief that none of the guns were pointed at her or Mulch.\\n\\n One of the elves stepped forward, popping the visor on her helmet.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Holly,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027ve been looking for you all morning. How\u0027ve you been?\u0027\\n\\n Holly swallowed a relieved sigh. It was Wing Commander Vinyaya, a long-time supporter of Holly and Julius Root. Vinyaya had blazed the trail for all females in the forces. In a five-hundred-year career she had done everything from leading a Retrieval team to the dark side of the moon, to heading up the liberal vote on the fairy Council. In addition to this, she had been Holly\u0027s flight instructor in the Academy.\\n\\n \u0027Fine, Commander,\u0027 said Holly.\\n\\n Vinyaya nodded at the solidifying mass of rock spittle.\\n\\n \u0027Keeping busy, I see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. That\u0027s Doodah Day. The fish smuggler. Quite a catch.\u0027\\n\\n The commander frowned. \u0027You\u0027re going to have to cut him loose, Holly. We have bigger snails to pop.\u0027\\n\\n Holly placed her boot on Doodah\u0027s midriff. She was reluctant to jump through LEP hoops, even for an under-cover wing commander.\\n\\n \u0027What kind of snails?\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya\u0027s frown deepened, cutting a slash between her brows.\\n\\n \u0027Can we talk in the car, Captain? The regulars are on the way.\u0027 Captain? Vinyaya had referred to her by her old rank? What was going on here? If the regulars were LEP, who were these fairies?\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t trust the force as much as I used to, Commander. You need to give me something before we go anywhere.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya sighed. \u0027Firstly, Captain, we\u0027re not the force. Not the one you think, anyway. Secondly, you want me to give you something? I\u0027ll give you two words. Care to hazard a guess what they are?\u0027\\n\\n Holly knew at once. She felt it.\\n\\n \u0027Artemis Fowl,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 confirmed Vinyaya. \u0027Artemis Fowl. Now, are you and your partner prepared to come with us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are you parked?\u0027 asked Holly.\\n\\n Vinyaya and her mysterious unit obviously had a serious budget. Not only were their weapons state of the art, but their transportation was way out of the usual LEP league. Within seconds of scraping Doodah Day and slip-ping a tracker into his boot, Holly and Mulch were strapped into lounger seats in the back of a stretch armoured vehicle. They weren\u0027t prisoners exactly, but Holly couldn\u0027t help feeling that she wasn\u0027t in control of her destiny any more.\\n\\n Vinyaya took off her helmet, shaking out long silver hair. Holly was surprised.\\n\\n The commander smiled. \u0027You like the colour? I got fed up dyeing it.\u0027\\n\\n 37\\n\\n \u0027Yes. It suits you.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch raised a finger. \u0027Sorry to interrupt the salon chat, but who are you people? You\u0027re not LEP, I\u0027ll bet my bum-flap on it.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya swivelled to face the dwarf. \u0027How much do you know about demons?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch checked the vehicle\u0027s cooler and was delighted to find sim-chicken and nettle beer. He liberated both.\\n\\n \u0027Demons. Not a lot. Never seen one myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about you, Holly? Remember anything from school?\u0027\\n\\n Holly was intrigued. Where could this conversation be going? Was this a test of some kind? She thought back to her history classes in Police Academy.\\n\\n \u0027Demons. The eighth family of the fairy People. Ten thou-sand years ago, after the Battle of Taillte, they refused to move underground, opting instead to lift their island out of time and live there in isolation.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya nodded. \u0027Very good. So they assembled their circle of warlocks and cast a time spell over the island of Hybras.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They disappeared off the face of the Earth,\u0027 recited Mulch. \u0027And no one\u0027s seen a demon since.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not quite true. A few have popped up over the centuries. One quite recently in fact. And guess who was there to meet him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Artemis,\u0027 said Holly and Mulch simultaneously.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. Somehow he was able to predict what we couldn\u0027t. We knew when, but our where was off by several metres.\u0027\\n\\n Holly sat forward. Interested. Back in the game.\\n\\n \u0027Did we get Artemis on film?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not exactly,\u0027 replied Vinyaya cryptically. \u0027If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll leave the explaining to someone more qualified than me. He\u0027s back at base.\u0027 And she would say no more on the subject. Most infuriating.\\n\\n Mulch wasn\u0027t one for patience.\\n\\n \u0027What? You\u0027re just going to take a nap? Come on, Vinyaya, tell us what little Arty is up to.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya would not be drawn. \u0027Relax, Mister Diggums. Have another nettle beer, or some spring water.\u0027 The commander took two bottles from the cooler, offering one to Mulch.\\n\\n Mulch studied the label. \u0027Derrier? No thanks. You know how they put the bubbles in this stuff?\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya\u0027s mouth twitched with the ghost of a smile. \u0027I thought it was naturally carbonated.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, that\u0027s what I thought until I got a prison job at the Derrier plant. They employ every dwarf in the Deeps. They made us sign confidentiality contracts.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya was hooked. \u0027So go on, tell me. How do they get the bubbles in?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch tapped his nose. \u0027Can\u0027t say. Breach of contract. All I can say is it involves a huge vat of water and several dwarfs using our… er,\u0027 Mulch pointed to his rear end \u0027… natural talents.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya replaced her bottle gingerly.\\n\\n As Holly sat back in her comfortable gel chair, enjoy-ing yet another of Mulch\u0027s tall tales, a niggling thought nudged through. She realized that Commander Vinyaya had avoided answering the dwarf\u0027s initial question. Who are these people?\\n\\n Ten minutes later, that question was answered.\\n\\n \u0027Welcome to Section Eight Headquarters,\u0027 said Vinyaya. \u0027Forgive my theatrics, it\u0027s not often we get to wow people.\u0027\\n\\n Holly didn\u0027t feel very wowed. They had pulled into a multi-storey car park several blocks down from Police Plaza. The stretch armoured vehicle followed the curved arrows up to the seventh floor, which was stuffed below the craggy roof ceiling. The driver parked in the least acces-sible, darkest space, then switched off the engine.\\n\\n They sat for several seconds in the damp darkness, listen-ing to rock-water drip from stalactites on to the roof.\\n\\n \u0027 Wow,\u0027 said Mulch. \u0027This is something. I guess you people spent all your money on the car.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya smiled. \u0027Just wait.\u0027\\n\\n The driver ran a quick proximity scan on the dashboard scanner and came up clean. He then took an infrared remote from the dash and clicked it through the transparent plastic roof at the rock face overhead. 40\\n\\n \u0027Remote-controlled rocks,\u0027 said Mulch dryly, delighted at the opportunity to exercise his sarcasm muscle.\\n\\n Vinyaya did not respond — she didn\u0027t have to. What happened next shut Mulch up all on its own. The parking space rose hydraulically, sending the car catapulting towards the rock face above. The rocks did not move out of the way. There was no doubt in Holly\u0027s mind that when rock went up against metal, the rock would win. It made no sense, of course, that Vinyaya would bring them here only to crush the entire party. But there was no time to consider this in the half a second that it took the stretch vehicle to reach the hard unforgiving rock.\\n\\n In truth the rock wasn\u0027t hard or unforgiving. It was digi-tal. They passed right through to a smaller carport, built into the rock.\\n\\n \u0027Hologram,\u0027 breathed Holly.\\n\\n Vinyaya winked at Mulch. \u0027Remote-controlled rocks,\u0027 she said. She flipped open the rear door, stepping out into an air-conditioned corridor.\\n\\n \u0027The entire headquarters has been hewn from the rock. Actually most of the cave was already here. We just lasered off a corner here and there. Forgive all the cloak-and-dagger, but it\u0027s vital that what we do here at Section Eight remains secret.\u0027\\n\\n Holly followed the commander through a set of auto-matic doors and down a slick corridor. There were sensors and cameras every few paces and Holly knew that her identity had been verified at least a dozen times before they reached the steel door at the end of the corridor.\\n\\n Vinyaya plunged her hand into a plate of liquid metal at the door\u0027s centre.\\n\\n \u0027Flux metal,\u0027 she explained, pulling her hand out. \u0027The metal is saturated with nano-sensors. There\u0027s no way to fake your way through this door. The nano-sensors read everything from my handprint to my DNA. Even if some-one cut off my hand and stuck it in here, the sensors would read a lack of pulse.\u0027\\n\\n Holly folded her arms. \u0027All this paranoia in one place. I think I can guess who your technical consultant is.\u0027\\n\\n The door whooshed back, and standing on the other side was exactly the person Holly had expected to see.\\n\\n \u0027Foaly,\u0027 she said fondly, stepping through to embrace the centaur.\\n\\n Foaly hugged her warmly, stamping his rear hooves with delight.\\n\\n \u0027Holly,\u0027 he said, holding her at arm\u0027s length. \u0027How have you been?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Busy,\u0027 replied Holly.\\n\\n Foaly frowned. \u0027You look a little skinny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Amazingly, so do you,\u0027 laughed Holly.\\n\\n Foaly had lost a little weight since she had last seen him. And his coat was glossy and groomed.\\n\\n Holly patted his flank. \u0027Hmm,\u0027 she mused. \u0027You\u0027re using conditioner, and you\u0027re not wearing the brain-probe-proof tinfoil hat. Don\u0027t tell me you have a little lady centaur tucked away somewhere.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly actually blushed. \u0027It\u0027s early days yet, but I\u0027m hope-ful.\u0027\\n\\n The room was packed from floor to ceiling with state-of-the-art electronics. In fact some of it was in the floor and ceiling, including wall-sized gas view screens, and an incredibly realistic sim-sky overhead.\\n\\n Foaly was obviously proud of what he had put together. \u0027Section Eight has the budget. I get the very best of every-thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about your old job?\u0027\\n\\n The centaur scowled. \u0027I tried working for Sool, but it didn\u0027t work out. He\u0027s destroying everything Commander Root built. Section Eight headhunted me discreetly at a speed-dating weekend. They made me an offer and I accepted. I get plenty of fawning adoration here, not to mention a huge salary hike.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch had a quick nosey around and was irritated to find that there wasn\u0027t a single crumb of food in the room.\\n\\n \u0027None of that salary went on vole curry, I suppose?\"\\n\\n Foaly raised an eyebrow at the dwarf, who was still coated with tunnel dirt.\\n\\n \u0027No. But we do have a shower room. You do know what a shower is, don\u0027t you, Diggums?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch\u0027s beard hair bristled. \u0027Yes, I do. And I know a donkey when I see one too.\u0027\\n\\n Holly stepped between them. \u0027OK, you two. No need to take up where you left off. Let\u0027s hold off on the tradi-tional insults until we find out where we are, and why we\u0027re here.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch lowered himself gleefully on to a cream couch, |, fully aware that some of his mucky coating would rub into the furniture. Holly sat beside him, but not too close.\\n\\n Foaly activated a wall screen, then touched it gently to navigate to the program he wanted.\\n\\n \u0027I love these new gas screens,\u0027 he snickered. \u0027Electric pulses heat the particles to different temperatures, causing the gas to turn different colours, forming pictures. Of course it\u0027s a lot more complicated than that, but I\u0027m dumb-ing it down for the convict.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was completely exonerated,\u0027 objected Mulch. \u0027As you well know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The charges were dropped,\u0027 Foaly pointed out. \u0027You were not exonerated. It\u0027s a different thing. Slightly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, like a centaur and a donkey are different things. ‘Slightly.\u0027\\n\\n Holly sighed. It was almost like old times. Foaly was the LEP technical consultant who had steered her through many ^ operations, and Mulch was their reluctant helper. It would be difficult for a stranger to believe that the dwarf and the centaur were actually good friends. She supposed this irritating bickering was how the males of every species showed affection.\\n\\n A life-size picture of a demon flashed up on the screen. Its eyes were slitted, and its ears were crowned with spikes.\\n\\n Mulch jumped. \u0027D\u0027Arvit!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Relax,\u0027 said Foaly. \u0027It\u0027s computer-generated. Amazing picture quality though, I grant you.\u0027 The centaur enlarged the face until it filled the screen.\\n\\n \u0027Full-grown buck demon. Post warp.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Post warp?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Holly. Demons do not grow like other fairies. They are quite cuddly until they hit puberty, then their bodies undergo a violent and painful spasm, or warp. After eight to ten hours they emerge from a cocoon of nutrient slime as demons. Before that, they are simply imps. Not the warlocks though, they never warp. Instead their magic blos-soms. I don\u0027t envy them. Instead of acne and mood swings, a pubescent warlock demon gets lightning bolts shooting out of his fingers. If he\u0027s lucky.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where do they shoot out of if he\u0027s unlucky? And why do we care about any of this?\u0027 asked Mulch, cutting to the chase.\\n\\n \u0027We care, because a demon popped up recently in Europe and we didn\u0027t get to him first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So we heard. Demons are coming back from Hybras now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe, Holly.\u0027 Foaly tapped the screen, splitting it into smaller sections. Demon pictures appeared in each one. \u0027These demons have materialized momentarily over the past five centuries. Luckily none of them have stayed around long enough to be captured by the Mud Men.\u0027 Foaly high-lighted the fourth picture. \u0027My predecessor managed to hold on to this one for twelve hours. He got a silver medal-lion on to him, and there was a full moon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That must\u0027ve been a special moment,\u0027 said Mulch.\\n\\n Foaly sighed. \u0027Didn\u0027t you learn anything in school? Demons are unique among all the creatures of the Earth. Their island, Hybras, is actually an enormous moonrock that came down in the Triassic period when the moon was hit by a meteorite. From what we can glean from fairy cave paintings and virtual models, this moonrock punched into a magma stream and more or less got itself welded to the surface. Demons are descended from lunar micro-organisms that lived inside the rock. They are subject to a strong physical and mental lunar attraction — they even levi-tate during the full moon. And it is this attraction which pulls them back into our dimension. They have to wear silver to repel the lunar pull. Silver is the most effective dimensional anchor. Gold works too, but sometimes you leave bits of yourself behind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So let\u0027s say we believe all this interdimensional lunar attraction baloney,\u0027 said Mulch, doing his utmost to wind Foaly up. \u0027What has that got to do with us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It has everything to do with us,\u0027 snapped Foaly. \u0027If the humans capture a demon, who do you think will be next under their microscope?\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya took up the backstory. \u0027That is why, five hundred years ago, Council Chairman Nan Burdeh set up Section Eight to monitor demon activity. Luckily Burdeh was a billionaire, and when she died, she left her entire fortune to Section Eight. Hence the rather impressive set-up. We are a very small, covert Council division of the LEP, but everything we have is the best. Over the years our brief has expanded to include secret missions that are too sensi-tive to entrust to regular LEP. But demonology is still our priority. For five centuries our finest minds have been study-ing the ancient demon texts, trying to predict where the next demon will pop up. Generally our calculations are correct and we can contain the situation. But twelve hours ago something happened in Barcelona.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What happened?\u0027 asked Mulch, a reasonable question for once.\\n\\n Foaly opened another box on the screen. Most of the picture was white. \u0027This happened.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch peered at the box. \u0027A very small snowstorm?\u0027\\n\\n Foaly wagged a finger at him. \u0027I swear, if I wasn\u0027t such a fan of mockery myself, I would have you tossed out of here on your combustible behind.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch accepted the compliment with a gracious nod.\\n\\n \u0027No, this is not a small snowstorm. This is white-out. Someone was blocking our Scopes.\u0027\\n\\n Holly nodded. Scopes was the shop name for the shrouded trackers attached to human communications satellites.\\n\\n \u0027You can see that whatever happened in our little snow-storm must have been pretty unusual, because the Mud Men are very eager to get away from it.\u0027\\n\\n On screen, humans outside the white-out zone ran away wildly or drove their cars into walls.\\n\\n \u0027Human news programmes report several sightings of a lizard-like creature appearing out of thin air for several seconds. Of course there are no photographs. I had calcu-lated that there would be an appearance, but more than three metres to the left, and we had set up an Elldee, sorry, Light Distortion projector accordingly. Unfortunately, although we got the time right, the exact location was wrong. Somehow, whoever was inside that ball of interfer-ence got the location exactly right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So Artemis saved us,\u0027 noted Holly.\\n\\n Vinyaya was puzzled. \u0027Saved us? How?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, if it hadn\u0027t been for that interference, our demon friend would have been all over the Internet by now. And you think that Artemis was inside the ball of interference.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly grinned, obviously delighted with his own cunning. \u0027Little Arty thought he could outwit me. He knows the LEP keep him under constant surveillance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even though they promised not to,\u0027 interjected Holly.\\n\\n Foaly ignored this technicality, ploughing on. \u0027So Artemis sent out decoys to Brazil and Finland, but we put a satel-lite on all three. Took a big chunk out of my budget, I can tell you.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch groaned. \u0027I am either going to barf, or fall asleep, or both.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya slammed a fist into her palm. \u0027Right. I\u0027ve had enough of the dwarf. Let\u0027s just toss him in a holding cell for a few days.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t do that,\u0027 objected Mulch.\\n\\n Vinyaya grinned nastily at him. \u0027Oh yes I can. You wouldn\u0027t believe the powers Section Eight has. So shut up, or listen to your own voice bouncing back at you from steel walls.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch locked his mouth and threw away the key.\\n\\n \u0027So we know Artemis was in Barcelona,\u0027 continued Foaly. \u0027And we know a demon appeared. He was at several other possible materialization sites too, but no demons showed up. He\u0027s involved somehow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do we know that for sure?\u0027 asked Holly.\\n\\n \u0027Here\u0027s how,\u0027 said Foaly. He tapped the screen, enlarg-ing a section of the Casa Mila\u0027s roof.\\n\\n Holly stared at the picture for several seconds, looking for whatever it was she was supposed to see.\\n\\n Foaly gave her a hint. \u0027This is a Gaudi building. You like Gaudi? He designed some lovely mosaics.\u0027\\n\\n Holly looked harder. \u0027Oh my God,\u0027 she said suddenly. \u0027It can\u0027t be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, but it is,\u0027 laughed Foaly, enlarging a particular rooftop mosaic until it filled the entire wall screen. There were two figures in the picture, stepping from a hole in the sky. One was obviously a demon, and the other was clearly Artemis Fowl.\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s impossible. That building must be a hundred years old.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Time is the key to this whole thing,\u0027 said Foaly. \u0027Hybras has been lifted out of time. A demon who gets sucked off the island drifts through the centuries like a temporal nomad. This demon obviously got hold of Artemis and took him along for the ride. They must have appeared to one of Gaudi\u0027s artists, or maybe even the man himself.\u0027\\n\\n Holly paled. \u0027You mean Artemis is…\"\\n\\n \u0027No, no. Artemis is home in bed. We\u0027ve pulled a satel-lite out of orbit to keep twenty-four-seven watch on him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How is this possible?\u0027\\n\\n Foaly said nothing, so Vinyaya answered the question. I\u0027ll take this one, because Foaly doesn\u0027t like saying the words. We don\u0027t know, Holly. This affair leaves a lot of important questions unanswered. That\u0027s where you come in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How? I don\u0027t know anything about demons.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya nodded craftily. \u0027Yes, but you know a lot about Artemis Fowl. I believe you keep in touch.\"\\n\\n Holly shrugged. \u0027Well, I wouldn\u0027t say we really…\u0027\\n\\n Foaly cleared his throat, then called up an audio file on the system.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, Artemis,\u0027 said a recording of Holly\u0027s voice. \u0027I\u0027ve got a little problem you might be able to help me with.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Happy to help, Holly,\u0027 said Artemis\u0027s voice. \u0027Something difficult, I hope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, there\u0027s this pixie I\u0027m after, but he\u0027s a fast one.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly switched off the file. \u0027I think we can say you\u0027re in contact.\u0027\\n\\n Holly smiled sheepishly, hoping nobody would ask who gave Artemis a fairy communicator.\\n\\n \u0027OK. I call from time to time. Just to keep an eye on him. For the greater good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whatever your reasons,\u0027 said Vinyaya, \u0027we need you to contact him again. Go to the surface and find out how he can predict demon appearances so accurately. According to Foaly\u0027s calculations, there isn\u0027t a demon appearance due for six weeks, but we would like to know where exactly it\u0027s going to be.\u0027\\n\\n Holly took her time to think about this.\\n\\n \u0027In what capacity would I be contacting Artemis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Full Captain, your old rank. Of course, now you\u0027d be working for Section Eight. Everything you do for us would be hush-hush.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A spy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A spy, but with excellent overtime and medical insur-ance.\u0027\\n\\n Holly jerked a thumb at Mulch. \u0027What about my partner?\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf jumped to his feet. \u0027I don\u0027t want to be a spy.\\n\\n Far too dangerous.\u0027 He winked slyly at Foaly. \u0027But I could be a consultant, for a fee.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya scowled. \u0027We\u0027re not prepared to grant Diggums a surface visa.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch shrugged. \u0027Good. I don\u0027t like the surface. It\u0027s too close to the sun and I have sensitive skin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But we are prepared to compensate him for loss of earn-ings.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready to put on the uniform again,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027I like working with Mulch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s call this mission a probationary term. Do this one I for us. See if you like the way we operate.\u0027\\n\\n Holly mulled it over. \u0027What colour is the uniform?\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya smiled. \u0027Matte black.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027I\u0027m in.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly hugged her again. \u0027I knew you\u0027d do it. I knew it. Holly Short cannot resist adventure. I told them.\u0027\\n\\n Vinyaya saluted stiffly. \u0027Welcome on board, Captain Short. Foaly will complete your briefing and get you kitted out. I expect you to make contact with the subject as soon as possible.\u0027\\n\\n Holly returned the salute. \u0027Yes, Commander. Thank you, Commander.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I have a debriefing with a pixie we\u0027ve managed to place inside the goblin triads. He has been wearing a scale suit for six months and he\u0027s having a bit of an identity crisis.\u0027 52\\n\\n Vinyaya left, her silver mane rippling behind her. The automatic doors closed with barely a whisper.\\n\\n Foaly dragged Holly from her seat.\\n\\n \u0027I have so much to show you,\u0027 he babbled excitedly. \u0027The fairies here are nice, but a bit on the square side. Sure they ooh and aah, but no one appreciates me like you do. We have our own shuttle port, you know. And field equipment! You are not going to believe the spec. Wait until you see the new Shimmer Suit. And the helmet! Holly, this thing comes home on its own. I built a series of mini-thrusters into the skin. It can\u0027t fly, but it can bounce wherever you want it to. The thing is beyond genius.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch covered his ears. \u0027Same old Foaly. Modest to a fault.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly aimed a kick at Mulch, pulling it at the last second.\\n\\n \u0027Keep it up, Diggums. I could snap at any moment. I am half beast, remember.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch moved the hoof away from his face with a finger. \u0027I can\u0027t help it,\u0027 he whined. \u0027All this melodrama. Someone has to poke fun.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly turned once more to his precious wall screen. He selected and enlarged an artist\u0027s impression of the island of Hybras.\\n\\n \u0027I know this all sounds very cloak-and-dagger, and I know you think I\u0027m making an anaconda out of a stinkworm. But believe me, somewhere on that island there is an unsuspecting demon who is about to make a reluctant visit to Earth and make life very difficult for us.\\n\\n Holly stepped close to the screen. Where was that reluc-tant demon? she wondered. And did he have any idea that he was about to be snatched from his own dimension and propelled into another?\\n\\n As it happened, Holly\u0027s questions were inaccurate on two counts. Firstly, the demon in question was not actu-ally a demon, he was just an imp. And secondly, the imp in question was anything but reluctant. In fact, visiting Earth was his dearest wish.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/208.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
