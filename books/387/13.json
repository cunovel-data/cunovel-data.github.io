{"id":40846,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13 Out Of Time","content":"THE journey between dimensions was more violent than Artemis remembered. There was no time to reflect on various scenery changes, and barely time for his senses to register sights, sounds or temperature changes. They were ripped from their own dimension and dragged through wormholes of space and time with only their consciousnesses intact. Only once did they materialize for the briefest second.\n The landscape was grey, bleak and pockmarked, and in the distance Artemis could see a blue planet camouflaged by cloud cover.\n I\u0027m on the moon, thought Artemis, then they were gone again, drawn by the lure of Hybras.\n It was an unnatural feeling, this out-of-body, out-of-mind travel. How am I still aware? thought Artemis. How is any of this possible?\n And stranger still, when he concentrated, Artemis could feel the thoughts of the others swirling around him. It was mostly broad emotions, such as fear or excitement. But after a bit of mental twiddling, Artemis detected specific thoughts too.\n There was Holly, wondering if her weapon would arrive intact. Typical soldier. And there was No.l, fretting inces-santly, not about the journey itself but about someone who would be waiting for him in Hybras. Abbot. A demon named Abbot.\n Artemis reached out and found Qwan floating in the ether. His mind was formidable, juggling complex compu-tations and philosophical puzzles.\n You are keeping the mind active, young human.\n Artemis\u0027s consciousness realized that this thought was directed at him. The warlock had felt his clumsy probe.\n Artemis could feel a difference between his mind and the others. They had something different. An alien energy. It was difficult to explain a feeling without senses, but for some reason it seemed to be blue. A blue plasma, electric and alive. Artemis allowed this rich feeling to flow through his mind and was instantly jolted by its energy,\n Magic, he realized. Magic is in the mind. Now this was something worth knowing. Artemis retreated to his own mind-space, but he took a sample of the blue plasma with him. You never know when a touch of magic would come in useful.\n They materialized on Hybras, inside the crater itself. Their arrival was accompanied by a flash of displaced energy. The group lay on the soot-blackened slopes, panting and steam-ing. The ground beneath them was warm to the touch, and the acrid stink of sulphur stung their nostrils. The eupho-ria of materialization soon dissipated.\n Artemis breathed experimentally, the air from his mouth blowing up small dust eddies. Volcanic gas made his eyes water, and flat flakes of ash instantly coated every exposed patch of skin.\n \u0027This could be hell,\u0027 he commented.\n \u0027Hell or Hybras,\u0027 said No.l, climbing to his knees. \u0027I got some of this ash on a tunic before. It never comes out.\u0027\n Holly was up too, running a systems check on her equip-ment.\n \u0027My Neutrino is fine. But I can\u0027t get a lock on a communications signal. We\u0027re on our own. And I seem to have lost the bomb.\u0027\n Artemis kneeled, his knees cracking through the ash crust, releasing the heat below. He glanced at his watch and caught sight of his own face. His hair was grey with ash, and for a second he thought he was looking at his father.\n A thought struck him. I look like my father, a father I may never see again. Mother. Butler. I have only one friend left.\n \u0027Holly,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let me look at you.\u0027\n Holly did not look up from her wrist computer.\n \u0027No time right now, Artemis.\u0027\n Artemis padded across to her, walking gingerly on the thin crust.\n \u0027Holly, let me look at you,\u0027 he said again, holding her shoulders.\n Something in Artemis\u0027s voice made Holly stop what she was doing and pay attention. This was not a tone Artemis Fowl used very often. It could almost class as tenderness.\n \u0027I just need to make sure you\u0027re still you. Things get mixed up between dimensions. On my last trip, I switched fingers.\u0027\n He held up his hand for her to see. \u0027Strange, I know. But you seem to be fine. All present and correct.\u0027\n Something flashed in the corner of Artemis\u0027s eye. There was a metal case half buried in the ash further up the crater wall.\n \u0027The bomb,\u0027 sighed Artemis. \u0027I thought we\u0027d lost it in transit. There was a flash when we landed.\u0027\n Qwan hurried across to the bomb. \u0027No. That was energy displacement. Mostly mine. Magic is almost another being. It flows where it will. Some of mine did not flow back to me in time, and ignited on re-entry. I am happy to say that the rest of my power is fired up and ready to go.\u0027\n Artemis was struck by how much of this prehistoric being\u0027s language was similar to NASA jargon. No wonder we don\u0027t have a chance against the fairies, he thought. They were solving dimensional equations when we were still knocking stones together.\n Artemis helped the warlock to heave the bomb from the ash\u0027s grip. The timer had been knocked for six by the time-jump and now read over five thousand hours. Finally, a stroke of luck.\n Artemis used Butler\u0027s picks to examine the bomb\u0027s workings. Maybe he could disarm it if he had a few months, a couple of computers and some laser tools. Without those things, there was about as much chance of him disarming this weapon, as there was of a squirrel making a paper aero-plane.\n \u0027This bomb is perfectly operational,\u0027 he said to Qwan. \u0027Only the timer was affected.\u0027\n The warlock stroked his beard. \u0027That makes sense. That instrument is relatively simple, compared to the complex-ity of our bodies. The dimension tunnel would have no trouble reassembling it. The timer is another matter. It will be affected by any time-flares we run across here. It could blow at any second, or never.\u0027\n Not never, thought Artemis. I may not be able to disarm this thing, but I can certainly blow it, when I need to.\n Holly peered at the deadly device. \u0027Is there any way we can dispose of it?\u0027\n Qwan shook his head. \u0027Inanimate objects cannot travel unaccompanied in the time tunnel. We, on the other hand, could get sucked back in at any moment. We need to get some silver on us immediately.\u0027\n Holly glanced at Artemis. \u0027Maybe some of us want to get sucked back in.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe you do,\u0027 said Qwan. \u0027But under certain condi-tions. If you just let yourselves go, who knows where you\u0027ll end up. Or when. Your natural space and time will attract you, but with the spell deteriorating, you could arrive encased in rock a mile below the surface, or stranded on the moon.\u0027\n This was a sobering thought. It was one thing to have a quick tourist\u0027s look at the surface of the moon. It was quite another to be stuck there forever. Not that you would know anything about it after the first minute.\n \u0027So we\u0027re stuck here?\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Come on, Artemis. You have a plan. You always have a plan.\u0027\n The others gathered round Artemis. There was some-thing about him that made people assume that he was the leader. Perhaps it was the way he assumed it himself. Also, in this instance, he was the tallest person in the group.\n He smiled briefly. So this is how Butler feels all the time.\n \u0027We all have our reasons for wanting to go back,\u0027 he began. \u0027Holly and I have left loved ones behind. Friends and family we would dearly love to see again. Number One and Qwan, you need to get your People out of this dimen-sion. The spell is unravelling, and soon nowhere on this island will be safe. If my calculations are correct, and I feel certain that they are, then not even silver can anchor you here for much longer. Now, you can go when the spell dictates, or we can decide when to make the jump.\u0027\n Qwan did his sums in his head. \u0027Not possible. It took seven warlocks and a volcano to move the island here. To get us back I would need seven magical beings. Warlocks preferably. And of course, a live volcano, which we don\u0027t have.\u0027\n \u0027Does it have to be a volcano? Wouldn\u0027t any energy source do?\u0027\n \u0027Theoretically,\u0027 agreed Qwan. \u0027So, you\u0027re saying we could use the bomb?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s possible.\u0027\n \u0027Highly unlikely, but possible. I still need seven magical beings.\u0027\n \u0027But the spell is already cast,\u0027 argued Artemis. \u0027The infra-structure is there. Couldn\u0027t you do it with fewer?\u0027\n Qwan wagged a finger at Artemis. \u0027You are a smart Mud Boy. Yes, maybe I could do it with fewer. Of course we would not know until we arrived.\u0027\n \u0027How many?\u0027\n \u0027Five. Five at the absolute least.\u0027\n Holly ground her teeth. \u0027We only have three, and Number One\u0027s a novice. So we need to find two demons with magic on this island.\u0027\n \u0027Impossible,\u0027 snapped Qwan. \u0027Once an imp warps, that\u0027s the end of any magic they might have. Only warlocks, like myself and Number One, do not warp. So we keep our magic.\u0027\n Artemis brushed ash from his jacket.\n \u0027Our first priority is to get out of this crater and find some silver. I suggest we leave the bomb here. The temper-ature is not enough to ignite it, and if it does explode, the volcano will absorb some of the force. If we are going to find some other magical creature, we will undoubtedly have a better chance outside this crater. At any rate, the sulphur is giving me a headache.\u0027\n Artemis did not wait for agreement. He turned and made for the crater lip. After a moment, the others followed, struggling with each footfall through the crust of ash. It reminded Artemis of a giant sand dune he\u0027d trudged up with his father once. Here, falling would have harsher consequences.\n It was a difficult and treacherous hike. The ash concealed grooves in the rock and small crevasses that vented warm air from the volcano. Colourful fungi grew in clusters around these vents, and they glowed in the crater shadows like coral night lights.\n Nobody spoke much during the climb. No.l muttered his way through large tracts of the dictionary, but the others realized that this was his way of keeping his chin up.\n Artemis glanced upwards occasionally. The sky was dawn red and glowed above him like a lake of blood.\n That\u0027s a cheery metaphor, thought Artemis. Maybe it says something about my character that a lake of blood is the only image I can come up with.\n No.l \u0027s build was best suited for the steep climb. He had a low centre of gravity, and could rest on his stumpy tail if need be. His thick feet anchored him securely and armoured plates covering his body protected him from sparks or bruising in the event of a fall.\n Qwan was clearly suffering. The old warlock had been a statue for the past ten thousand years and was still work-ing the kinks out of his bones. Magic soothed the process somewhat, but even magic could not completely erase the pain. He winced each time his foot punctured the soot crust.\n Finally the group reached the summit. If time had passed it was impossible to tell how much. The sky still had the same red tinge, and all timepieces had virtually stopped.\n Holly jogged the last few steps, then raised her right hand, fingers closed in a fist.\n \u0027That means halt,\u0027 Artemis told the others. \u0027It\u0027s a mili-tary thing. Human soldiers use the exact same sign.\u0027\n Holly poked her head above the rim for a moment, then returned to the group.\n \u0027What does it mean if there are a lot of demons on their way up the mountain?\u0027\n Qwan smiled. \u0027It means our brother demons saw the flash of our arrival and are coming to greet us.\u0027\n \u0027And what does it mean if they are all armed with cross-bows?\u0027\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 mused Qwan. \u0027That could be a touch more serious.\u0027\n \u0027How bad can they be?\u0027 asked Artemis. \u0027We\u0027ve faced trolls together.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s fine,\u0027 said Holly, powering up her handgun. \u0027They\u0027re not so big. We\u0027re going to be fine. Really.\u0027\n Artemis frowned. Holly only bothered reassuring him when they were in deep trouble.\n \u0027That bad?\u0027 he said.\n Holly whistled, shaking her head. \u0027You have no idea.\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/219.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
