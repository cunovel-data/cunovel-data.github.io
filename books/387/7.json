{"id":40840,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7 Bobos Run","content":"THE PARCHATEAU, SOUTHERN FRANCEBY the time Mulch and Doodah landed outside Tourrettes sur Loup, the dwarf was a nervous wreck.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s crazy,\u0027 he gibbered, tumbling from the hatch of a tiny titanium pod, which had been landed expertly on a flat patch not much bigger than a postage stamp. \u0027The pixie is crazy! Give me your gun, Holly. I\u0027m going to shoot him.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah Day appeared in the hatch, hopping nimbly to the ground. \u0027That ship is fantastic,\u0027 he said in Gnommish. \u0027Where can I get one?\u0027\\n\\n His grin withered and died when he noticed that the thing he had previously believed to be a tree moved and spoke in one of the primitive Mud Man tongues.\\n\\n \u0027This would be Doodah Day, I presume. He makes a lot of noise, doesn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arkkkk,\u0027 said Doodah. \u0027Big Mud Man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, he is,\u0027 said another Mud Man, or maybe a Mud Boy. This one was smaller, but somehow seemed even more dangerous.\\n\\n \u0027You speak Gnommish?\u0027 asked the terrified pixie, in case the big one would eat him for not being polite.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027I do, but Butler is not so fluent. So English, if you wouldn\u0027t mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure thing. Not a problem,\u0027 said Doodah, grateful that he still had the tiny spark of magic left in his brain neces-sary to fuel his gift of tongues.\\n\\n Doodah and Mulch had flown across the lower peaks of the Alpes Maritimes in a pod built for riding the magma flares from the Earth\u0027s core. These chutes had rudimentary shields, but they were not intended for above-ground travel. Doodah\u0027s instructions had been to ride the hotshots to a small port near Berne, Switzerland, then strap on a pair of wings and low-fly the rest of the way. But once Doodah \"got behind the pod\u0027s wheel, he decided that it would be much faster if they did the second leg on board the tiny ship.\\n\\n Holly was impressed. \u0027You fly pretty well for a smug-gler. Those pods handle like a three-legged pig.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah slapped a titanium fin fondly. \u0027She\u0027s a good girl. You just need to treat her right.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch was still shaking. \u0027We came this close — this close to being incinerated! I lost count after the first dozen times.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah chortled. \u0027That\u0027s not all you lost, dwarf. Someone is going to have to swab the decks in there.\u0027\\n\\n Holly looked Doodah in the eyes. OK, they were making small talk, but there was a little history between them.\\n\\n \u0027You could have killed me, pixie,\u0027 said Holly evenly, giving the little smuggler a chance to explain himself.\\n\\n \u0027I know. I nearly did. That\u0027s why it\u0027s time for me to get out of the business. Review the situation. Take a long hard look at my priorities.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Horse manure,\u0027 tutted Holly. \u0027I don\u0027t believe a word.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me neither,\u0027 said Doodah. \u0027That\u0027s my parole board spiel. With the big eyes and the wobbly lip, works every time. But seriously, I\u0027m sorry about the multimixer thing, Officer. I was desperate. But you were never in danger. These hands are pure magic on a wheel,\u0027\\n\\n Holly decided to let it go. Nursing a grudge would only make a difficult mission next to impossible. And anyway, now Doodah would have a chance to make it up to her.\\n\\n Butler lifted Mulch to his feet.\\n\\n \u0027How are you doing there, Mulch?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch glowered at Doodah. \u0027I will be doing fine once my head stops spinning. That ship is only built for one, you know. I\u0027ve had that little monkey on my lap for the past few hours. Every time we went over a bump, he butted me under the chin.\u0027\\n\\n Butler winked at his dwarf friend. \u0027Well, look at it this way. You had to take a ride in his environment, but now he has to take a ride in yours.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah caught the end of that sentence. \u0027Ride? What ride? Who has to take a ride?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch rubbed his hairy palms together. \u0027I am going to enjoy this.\u0027\\n\\n They lay down in a row in a low ditch overlooking the chateau. The land sloped gently downwards and was dotted with the twisted forms of ancient olive trees. The surface soil was dry and loose, but reasonably tasty according to Mulch.\\n\\n \u0027The Alpine water is pretty good,\u0027 he explained, spit-ting out a mouthful of pebbles. \u0027And the olives give the clay a nice tang.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s very nice,\u0027 said Artemis patiently. \u0027But all I really want to know is can you make it to the septic tank?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Septic tank?\u0027 said Doodah nervously. \u0027What are we talk-ing about septic tanks for? I ain\u0027t going into no septic tank. Forget the deal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not into the tank,\u0027 corrected Artemis. \u0027Behind it. The tank is the only cover before the chateau itself.\u0027\\n\\n Holly was scanning the terrain with her visor. \u0027The tank is buried as close to the house as possible. After that it\u0027s just rock. But you have a nice thick vein of soil as far as that point. What you need to do is lure that boy in the Cowboy hat in behind the tank with a bar of chocolate, then Doodah takes his place.\u0027 144\\n\\n \u0027Then what? That toy car isn\u0027t going anywhere fast.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t need to, Doodah. All you have to do is drive inside the house and wind this round any video cable you see.\u0027\\n\\n Holly handed Doodah a cable tie with tiny spikes along its length. \u0027This is loaded fibre optic. Once it\u0027s in place, we own their surveillance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can we rewind to the bar of chocolate?\u0027 said Mulch. \u0027Does anyone have one?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 said Artemis, handing him a flat bar in a green wrapper. \u0027Butler bought this in the village. It\u0027s very low quality, not seventy per cent cocoa, or fair trade for that matter, but it will do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what about after the kid eats the chocolate?\u0027 asked Mulch. \u0027What do I do with a kid?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are not to injure him,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Just entertain him for a minute.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Entertain him? How am I supposed to do that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Use your dwarf talents,\u0027 suggested Artemis. \u0027Young children are inquisitive. Eat some rocks. Pass wind. Little Beau will be fascinated.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t I just shoot him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mulch!\u0027 said Holly, horrified.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean kill him. Just knock him out for a few minutes. Kids like naps. I\u0027d be doing him a favour really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Knocking him out would be ideal,\u0027 admitted Holly. \u0027But I don\u0027t have anything safe, so you\u0027ll have to keep him busy for five minutes tops.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am a charmer, I suppose,\u0027 said Mulch. \u0027And if worst comes to worst, I can always eat him.\u0027 He grinned widely at Holly\u0027s horrified expression. \u0027I\u0027m kidding. Honest. I\u0027d never eat a Mud Kid, they\u0027re too bony.\u0027\\n\\n Holly elbowed Artemis, who was beside her on the bank. \u0027Are you sure about this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was your basic idea,\u0027 replied Artemis. \u0027But, yes, I am sure. There are other options, but we don\u0027t have the time. Mulch has always displayed initiative. I feel certain he won\u0027t let us down. As for Mister Day, his freedom is on the line. A strong incentive to perform.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Enough of the chatter,\u0027 said Mulch. \u0027I\u0027m starting to burn here. You know how sensitive dwarf skin is.\u0027 He stood, unbuttoning a bum-flap on the seat of his pants. Where else would a bum-flap be? \u0027OK, pixie. Hop on.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah Day seemed genuinely frightened. \u0027Are you sure?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch sighed. \u0027Sure I\u0027m sure. What are you afraid of? It\u0027s just a rear end.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, maybe. But it\u0027s smiling at me.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps it\u0027s happy to see you. You don\u0027t want to be there if it gets angry.\u0027\\n\\n Holly punched Mulch on the shoulder. \u0027That is a really bad habit,\u0027 complained Mulch, rubbing his upper arm. \u0027You should see someone about your anger issues.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could you please quit the bum talk? We\u0027re on a tight schedule here!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK. Get on, pixie. I promise it won\u0027t bite.\u0027 Butler lifted the tiny pixie on to Mulch\u0027s back. \u0027Just don\u0027t look down,\u0027 advised the bodyguard. \u0027You\u0027ll be OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Easy for you to say,\u0027 grumbled Doodah. \u0027You\u0027re not the one riding the whirlwind. You never mentioned this in the restaurant, Diggums.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis pointed at the pixie\u0027s backpack. \u0027Do you really need that, Mister Day? It\u0027s not very streamlined.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah held on to the strap. \u0027Tools of the trade, Mud Boy. They go where I go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027A word of advice. Get in and out as fast as you can.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah rolled his eyes. \u0027Wow, that\u0027s great advice. You should write a book.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch chortled. \u0027Good one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And avoid his family,\u0027 continued Artemis. \u0027Especially the girl Minerva.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Family. Minerva. Got it. Now, let\u0027s go if we\u0027re going, before I lose my nerve.\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf unhinged his jaw with wince-worthy cracks, and dived head first into the mound of earth. It was some-thing to see, scythe-like jaws chomping through the dirt, excavating a tunnel for the dwarf and his passenger.\\n\\n Doodah\u0027s eyes were tightly shut, and his expression was one of absolute shock.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, gods,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let me off. Let me —\u0027\\n\\n Then they were gone, lost under a blanket of vibrating earth. Holly elbowed her way atop the mound, following their progress through her visor.\\n\\n \u0027Diggums is fast,\u0027 she proclaimed. \u0027I\u0027m surprised we ever caught him.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis lay beside her. \u0027I hope he\u0027s fast enough. The last thing we need is for Minerva Paradizo to add a dwarf and a pixie to her fairy collection.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch felt good underground. This was a dwarf\u0027s natural habitat. His fingers absorbed the rhythms of the earth, and they calmed him. His coarse beard hairs, which were actu-ally a series of sensors, dug into the clay, worming into cracks, sending out pings and reporting back to Mulch\u0027s brain. He could feel rabbits digging half a mile to his left.\\n\\n Maybe he could snag one on the way back, for a snack.\\n\\n Doodah hung on for dear life. His face was a rictus of desperation. He would have screamed, but that would have meant opening his mouth. And that was out of the ques-tion.\\n\\n Just below Doodah\u0027s toes, Mulch\u0027s behind churned out a rapid-fire mixture of dirt and air, driving the pair deeper into the tunnel. Doodah could feel the heat from the reaction spreading up his legs. Every now and then, the pixie\u0027s boots dropped too close to the dwarf\u0027s rear exhaust and Doodah would have to jerk them up or lose a toe.\\n\\n It only took Mulch a minute to reach the septic tank. He eased himself from the earth, blinking mud from his eyes with thick corkscrew dwarf lashes.\\n\\n \u0027Spot on,\u0027 he mumbled, spitting out a wriggling worm.\\n\\n Doodah hauled himself over the dwarf\u0027s head, clamping a hand over his own mouth to stop himself screaming. After several deep breaths, he calmed down sufficiently to hiss at Mulch.\\n\\n \u0027You enjoyed that, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch rehinged his jaw, then released a final burst of tunnel gas, which popped him out of the earth.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s what I do. Let\u0027s say we\u0027re even for the pod ride.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah disagreed. \u0027Let\u0027s say I still owe you one for swal-lowing me.\u0027\\n\\n The bickering would probably have continued, in spite of the urgency of their mission, had not a little boy in an electric toy car come trundling round the corner of the tank.\\n\\n \u0027Hello. I am Beau Paradizo,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027Are you monsters?\u0027\\n\\n Doodah and Mulch froze momentarily, then remem-bered the plan.\\n\\n \u0027No, little boy,\u0027 said Mulch, glad he still had the tiny spark of magic necessary to speak French. He tried to smile endearingly, something he didn\u0027t spend a lot of time prac-tising in the mirror. \u0027We are the chocolate fairies. And we have a special gift for you.\u0027 He waved the chocolate bar, hoping the theatrical presentation would make the cheap candy seem more impressive than it was.\\n\\n \u0027Chocolate fairies?\u0027 said the boy, climbing from his car. \u0027Sugar-free chocolate, I hope. Because I get hyper with sugar, and Daddy says that God knows I\u0027m already hyper enough without it, but he still loves me.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch glanced at the label. Eighteen per cent sugar.\\n\\n \u0027Yep. Sugar-free. Would you like a square?\u0027\\n\\n Beau took the entire bar and demolished it in less than ten seconds.\\n\\n \u0027You fairies stink. Especially you, hairy. You stink worse than the blocked toilet in Aunty Morgana\u0027s. Stinky fairy.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah laughed. \u0027What can I tell you. The kid tells it like it is, Mulch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you live in a blocked toilet, Mister Fatty Chocolate Fairy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 said Mulch brightly. \u0027How about a nap? Would you like a nap, kid?\u0027\\n\\n Beau Paradizo punched Mulch in the stomach. \u0027I had a nap, stupid. More chocolate! Now!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No punching! I don\u0027t have more chocolate.\u0027\\n\\n Beau punched him again. \u0027I said more chocolate! Or I\u0027m going to call the guards. And Pierre will reach down your throat and pull out your guts. That\u0027s what he does. He told me.\\n\\n Mulch sniggered. \u0027I\u0027d like to see him reach into my insides.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027 asked Beau brightly. \u0027I\u0027ll get him!\u0027 The little boy sprinted for the corner of the tank. He moved with surprising speed, and Mulch\u0027s instincts took over from his brain. The dwarf leaped towards the boy, unhingeing as he went.\\n\\n \u0027Pierre!\u0027 shouted Beau once, but not a second time, because Mulch had enclosed him in his mouth. All except the cowboy hat.\\n\\n \u0027Do not swallow!\u0027 hissed Doodah.\\n\\n Mulch worked the boy round his cheeks for a\u0027 few seconds, then spat him out. Beau was dripping wet and sound asleep. Mulch wiped the child\u0027s face before the dwarf spittle could harden.\\n\\n \u0027Sedative in the saliva,\u0027 he explained, hooking up his jaw. \u0027It\u0027s a predator thing. You didn\u0027t fall asleep yesterday because I didn\u0027t do your head. He\u0027ll wake up completely refreshed. I\u0027ll peel this stuff off when it hardens.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah shrugged. \u0027Hey, do I care? I didn\u0027t like him anyway.\u0027\\n\\n A voice drifted over the tank. \u0027Beau? Where are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That must be Pierre. You better get moving, lead him away from here.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah poked his head above the embankment. A large man was headed their way. Not as large as Butler, true, but plenty big enough to squash the pixie under a single boot. The man wore a black security jumpsuit with matching hat. A pistol grip poked from between the buttons. The man squinted towards the tank.\\n\\n \u0027Beau? Is that you?\u0027 he said in French.\\n\\n \u0027Oui. C\u0027est moi,\u0027 replied Doodah in a warbling falsetto.\\n\\n Pierre was not convinced. The voice had sounded more like a talking piglet than a child. He kept coming, reach-ing inside his jumpsuit for the gun.\\n\\n Doodah bolted for the electric car. On the way he picked up Beau\u0027s cowboy hat, jamming it on to his head. Pierre was barely a dozen steps away now, and quickening his pace.\\n\\n \u0027Beau? Come here now. Minerva wants you in the house.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah slid over the bonnet into the car, hillbilly style. He could tell from a single glance that this toy wouldn\u0027t do much more than walking speed, which would be zero use to him in an emergency. He pulled a flat black panel from his bag, suckering it on to the little car\u0027s plastic dash. This was a Mongocharger, something no self-respecting smuggler would leave home without. The Mongocharger was equipped with a strong computer, omni- sensor and a clean nuclear battery pack. The omni-sensor hacked into the toy car\u0027s tiny chip and took over its workings. Doodah pulled a retractable spike cable from the Mongocharger\u0027s base and plunged the tip into the car\u0027s own power cable beneath the dash. Now the toy car was nuclear-powered.\\n\\n Doodah revved the accelerator.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s more like it,\u0027 he said, satisfied.\\n\\n Pierre came round the right side of the tank. This was good because Mulch and the dozing Beau were on his blind side. It was bad because Pierre was directly behind Doodah.\\n\\n \u0027Beau?\u0027 said Pierre. \u0027Is something wrong?\u0027 His gun was out, pointed at the ground.\\n\\n Doodah\u0027s foot hovered over the accelerator, but he couldn\u0027t punch it now. Not with this goon staring down his neck.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing\u0027s wrong… eh… Pierre,\u0027 he trilled, keep-ing his face hidden under the cowboy hat\u0027s brim.\\n\\n \u0027You sound strange, Beau. Are you ill?\u0027\\n\\n Doodah tipped the accelerator, inching forward.\\n\\n \u0027No. I\u0027m fine. Just doing funny voices, the way human kids do.\u0027\\n\\n Pierre was still suspicious. \u0027Human kids?\u0027\\n\\n Doodah took a chance. \u0027Yes. Human kids. I\u0027m an alien today, pretending to be a human, so go away or I will reach down your throat and pull out your guts.\u0027\\n\\n Pierre stopped in his tracks, thought for a moment, then remembered.\\n\\n \u0027Beau, you scoundrel. Don\u0027t let Minerva hear you talk-ing like that. No more chocolate if you do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pull out your guts!\u0027 repeated Doodah for good measure, accelerating gently across a gravel bed on to the driveway.\\n\\n The pixie pulled a stick-on convex mirror from his pack, suckering it to the windscreen. He was relieved to see that Pierre had bolstered his weapon and was headed back to his post.\\n\\n Even though it went against all his smuggler\u0027s instincts, Doodah kept his speed down on the driveway. His teeth knocked together as he drove over the uneven granite flagstones. A digital read-out informed him that he was utilizing one hundredth of one per cent of the engine\u0027s new power. Doodah remembered just in time to mute the Mongocharger. The last thing he needed right now was the computer\u0027s electronic voice complaining about his driving skills.\\n\\n There were two guards in front of the main doors. They barely glanced down as Doodah swept past.\\n\\n \u0027Howdy, Sheriff,\u0027 said one, grinning.\\n\\n \u0027Chocolate,\u0027 squeaked Doodah. From the little he knew about Beau, it seemed the appropriate thing to say.\\n\\n He tapped the accelerator to bump him over the lintel, then drove slowly across a streaked marble floor. The tyres spun for grip on the sleek stone, which was a bit worrying — it could cost crucial seconds in the event that he had to make a quick getaway. But at least the corridor was wide enough for a U-turn if one became necessary.\\n\\n Doodah motored down the hallway, past rows of tower-ing potted palms and several bright abstract works of art until he came to the corridor\u0027s end. There was a camera mounted over an archway, pointed directly at the front hall. A cable snaked out from the box and into a conduit which ran down to the base of the wall.\\n\\n Doodah pulled up by the conduit, hopping from the car. So far his luck was holding. Nobody had challenged him. This human security was lame. In any fairy building he would have been laser-scanned a dozen times by now. The pixie yanked a section of conduit away, revealing the cable beneath. It took him mere seconds to twist the length of loaded fibre optics round the video cable. Job done. Smiling, Doodah climbed back into his stolen car. This had been a sweet deal. Amnesty for five minutes\u0027 work. Time to go home and enjoy a life of freedom, until he broke the rules again.\\n\\n \u0027Beau Paradizo, you little brat. Come over here, right now!\u0027\\n\\n Doodah froze momentarily, then checked his mirror. There was a girl behind him, glaring his way, hands on hips. This, he guessed, would be Minerva. If memory served, he was supposed to keep far away from Minerva.\\n\\n \u0027Beau. It\u0027s time for your antibiotic. Do you want to have that chest infection forever?\u0027\\n\\n Doodah started the car, rolling it towards the arch and out of this Mud Girl\u0027s sight line. Once round the corner, he could floor the accelerator.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you dare drive away from me, Bobo.\u0027\\n\\n Bobo? No wonder I\u0027m driving away, thought Doodah. Who would drive towards someone calling them Bobo?\\n\\n \u0027Eh… chocolate?\u0027 said the pixie hopefully.\\n\\n It was the wrong thing to do. This girl knew her brother\u0027s voice when she heard it, and that wasn\u0027t it.\\n\\n \u0027Bobo? Is there something wrong with your voice?\u0027\\n\\n Doodah swore under his breath.\\n\\n \u0027Ches\u0027 inflec-chun?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n But Minerva wasn\u0027t buying it. She took a walkie-talkie from her pocket and took rapid strides towards the car.\\n\\n \u0027Pierre, can you come in here, please? Bring Andre and Louis.\u0027 And then to Doodah, \u0027Just stay there, Bobo. I have a nice bar of chocolate for you.\u0027\\n\\n Sure, thought Doodah. Chocolate and a concrete cell.\\n\\n He considered his options for a second and came to a conclusion. The conclusion was: / would rather escape quickly, than get captured and tortured to death.\\n\\n I am out of here, thought Doodah, and floored the accel-erator, sending several hundred horsepower shuddering down the fragile driveshaft. He had maybe a minute before the car fell apart, but by then he could be far away from this Mud Girl and her transparent promises of chocolate.\\n\\n The car took off so fast that it left an image of itself where it had been.\\n\\n Minerva stopped dead. \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n There was a corner coming up quickly. Doodah pulled the wheel in as far as he could, but the vehicle\u0027s turning circle was too wide.\\n\\n \u0027Gotta bounce it,\u0027 said Doodah through gritted teeth.\\n\\n He leaned hard left, eased up on the accelerator and hit the wall side-on. At the moment of impact he shifted his weight and stepped on the gas. The car lost a door, but shot out of the corner like a stone from a sling.\\n\\n Beautiful, thought Doodah as soon as his head stopped ringing.\\n\\n He had maybe seconds now before the girl could see him again, and who knew how many guards stood between him and freedom.\\n\\n He was in a long straight corridor, opening on to a sitting room. Doodah could see a wall-mounted television and the top rim of a red velvet sofa. There must be steps down into the room. Not good. This car only had one more impact left in it.\\n\\n \u0027Where is Bobo?\u0027 shouted the girl. \u0027What have you done with him?\u0027\\n\\n No point in subtlety now. Time to see what this buggy could do. Doodah jammed his foot on the accelerator, then made a beeline for a window behind the velvet sofa. He patted the dash.\\n\\n \u0027You can do it, you little junk box. One jump. Your chance to be a thoroughbred.\u0027\\n\\n The car didn\u0027t answer back. They never did. Though occasionally in times of extreme stress and oxygen depri-vation, Doodah imagined they shared his cavalier attitude.\\n\\n Minerva came round the corner. She was running hard, and screaming into a walkie-talkie. Doodah heard the words apprehend, necessary violence and interrogation. None of which boded well for him.\\n\\n The toy car\u0027s wheels spun on a long rug, then caught. The rug was shunted backwards like a length of toffee from a roller. Minerva was bowled over, but kept talking as she went down.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s headed for the library. Take him down! Shoot if necessary.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah held on to the wheel grimly, keeping his line. He was going out of that window, closed or not. He entered the room at seventy miles per hour, flying off the top step. Not bad acceleration for a toy. There were two guards in the room, in the act of drawing their weapons. They wouldn\u0027t shoot though. It still appeared as though the car was being driven by a child.\\n\\n Suckers, thought Doodah — then the first bullet crashed into the chassis. OK, maybe they would shoot the car.\\n\\n He flew in a gentle arc towards the window. Two more bullets took plastic chunks from the bodywork, but it was too late to stop the tiny vehicle. It clipped the lower frame, lost a fender and tumbled out through the open window.\\n\\n Someone really should be filming this, thought Doodah, as he clenched his teeth for impact.\\n\\n The crash shook him all the way from his toes to his skull. Stars danced before Doodah\u0027s eyes for a moment, then he was in control again, careering towards the septic tank. 158\\n\\n Mulch was waiting, his wild halo of hair quivering with impatience.\\n\\n \u0027Where have you been? I\u0027m running out of sunblock.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah did not waste time with an answer. Instead he extricated himself from the all but demolished car, prising off his Mongocharger and mirror.\\n\\n Mulch pointed a stubby finger at him. \u0027I have a few more questions.\u0027\\n\\n A bullet fired from the open window ricocheted off\" the septic tank, throwing up concrete splinters.\\n\\n \u0027But they can wait. Hop on.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch turned, presenting Doodah with his back, and more besides. Doodah jumped on, grabbing thick hanks of Mulch\u0027s beard.\\n\\n \u0027Go!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027They\u0027re right behind me!\u0027\\n\\n Mulch unhinged his jaw and he went into the clay like a hairy torpedo.\\n\\n But fast as he was, they wouldn\u0027t have made it. Armed guards were two paces away. They would have seen the gently snoring Beau and riddled the moving tunnel mound with bullets. They probably would have tossed in a few grenades for good measure. But they didn\u0027t, because at that precise moment all hell broke loose inside the chateau.\\n\\n As soon as Doodah had twisted the loaded fibre optic round the video cable, hundreds of tiny spikes had punctured the rubber, making dozens of strong contacts with the wiring inside.\\n\\n Seconds later in Section 8 HQ, information came flooding into Foaly\u0027s terminal. He had video, alarm systems, waffle boxes and communications all flashing up in separ-ate windows on his screen.\\n\\n Foaly cackled, cracking his knuckles like a concert pianist. He loved those old fibre optic twists. Not as fancy as the new organic bugs, but twice as reliable.\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 he said into a reed mike on his desk. \u0027I\u0027m in control. What kind of nightmares would you like to give the Paradizos?\u0027\\n\\n In the south of France, Captain Holly Short spoke into her helmet microphone. \u0027Whatever you have. Storm troop-ers, helicopters. Overload their communications, blow out their waffle boxes. Set off all the alarms. I want them to believe they are under attack.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly called up several phantom files on his computer. The phantoms were one of his own pet projects. He would lift patterns from human movies, soldiers, explosions what-ever, and then use them universally in whatever scene he chose. In this case he sent a squad of French Army special forces, the Commandement des Operations Speciales, or COS, to the Paradizos\u0027 closed-circuit system. That would do nicely for starters. 160\\n\\n Inside the chateau, the Paradizo chief of security, Juan Soto, had a little problem. His little problem was that a couple of loose shots were being popped off in the house. This can only be seen as a little problem in relation to the very big problem that Foaly was sending his way.\\n\\n Soto was speaking into a radio.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Miss Paradizo,\u0027 he said, keeping his voice calm… \u0027I realize that your brother may be missing. I say may be because that may be him in the toy car. It sure looks like him to me. OK, OK, I take your point. It is unusual for toy cars to fly that far. It could be a malfunction.\u0027\\n\\n Soto resolved to have strong words with the two idiots who had actually fired on a toy car on Minerva\u0027s command. He did not care how smart she was, no child was giving orders like that on his watch.\\n\\n Even though Miss Minerva was nowhere near the secu-rity centre and could not see his face, Chief Soto adopted a stern expression for the lecture he was about to give.\\n\\n \u0027Now, Miss Paradizo, you listen to me,\u0027 he began, then his expression changed completely as the security system went ballistic.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Chief, I\u0027m listening.\u0027\\n\\n The chief held on to his radio with one hand; with the other he flicked numerous switches on his security console, praying for malfunction. \u0027There seems to be a full squad of COS converging on the chateau. My God, there are some in the house. Helicopters, the rooftop cameras are picking up helicopters.\u0027 Transmissions suddenly squawked through the band monitor. \u0027And we have chatter. They\u0027re after you, Miss Paradizo, and your prisoner. My God, the alarms have all been tripped. Every sector. We\u0027re surrounded! We need to evacuate. I can see them in the treeline. They have a tank. How did they get a tank up here?\u0027\\n\\n Outside, Artemis and Butler watched the chaos Foaly had created. Alarm klaxons ripped through the Alpine air and security men sprinted to ordained spots.\\n\\n Butler lobbed a few smoke grenades into the grounds to add to the effect.\\n\\n \u0027A tank,\u0027 said Artemis wryly into his fairy phone. \u0027You sent them a tank?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve hacked into the audio feed?\u0027 said Foaly sharply. \u0027Just what else can that phone of yours do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It can play solitaire and minesweeper,\u0027 replied Artemis innocently.\\n\\n Foaly grunted doubtfully. \u0027We\u0027ll talk about this later, Mud Boy. For now, let\u0027s concentrate on the plan.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excellent suggestion. Do you have any phantom guided missiles?\u0027\\n\\n The security chief nearly fainted. The radar had picked up two tracks spiralling from the belly of a helicopter.\\n\\n \u0027Man Dieu! Missiles. They\u0027re firing smart bombs at us. We must evacuate now.\u0027 162\\n\\n He flicked open a perspex panel, revealing an orange switch below. With only a moment\u0027s hesitation, he pressed the orange switch. The various alarms were immediately cut off and replaced by a single continuous whine. The evac alarm.\\n\\n The moment this was sounded, the guards changed course, heading for their assigned vehicles or principals, and the non-security residents of the chateau began gath-ering data or whatever was most precious to them.\\n\\n On the eastern side of the house, a series of garage doors opened and six black BMW four-wheel drives sprang into the courtyard like cougars. One had blacked-out windows.\\n\\n Artemis studied the situation through binoculars.\\n\\n \u0027Watch the girl,\u0027 he said into the tiny phone in his palm. \u0027The girl is the key. I\u0027m guessing hers is the vehicle with the tinted windows.\u0027\\n\\n The girl Minerva appeared through patio doors, speak-ing calmly into a walkie-talkie. Her father trailed beside her, dragging a protesting Beau Paradizo by the hand. Billy Kong came last, bending slightly under the weight of a large golf bag.\\n\\n \u0027Here we go, Holly. Are you ready?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Artemis! I\u0027m the field agent here,\u0027 came the irritated reply. \u0027Stay off my band unless you have something to contribute.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was just thinking…\u0027\\n\\n ’I was just thinking that you should change your middle name to control freak.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis glanced across at Butler, who was lying beside him on the verge and couldn\u0027t help overhearing the entire exchange.\\n\\n \u0027Control freak? Can you believe that?\u0027 \u0027The nerve of some people,\u0027 replied the bodyguard, without taking his eyes off the chateau.\\n\\n To their left, a small patch of earth began to vibrate. Mud, grass and insects were thrust upwards in a sudden gush, followed by two heads. One dwarf and one pixie.\\n\\n Doodah climbed over Mulch\u0027s shoulders, collapsing on the ground.\\n\\n \u0027You people are crazy,\u0027 he panted, plucking a beetle from his shirt pocket. ‘I should be getting more than amnesty for this. I should be getting a pension.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quiet, little man,\u0027 said Butler calmly. \u0027Phase two of the plan is about to start, and I wouldn\u0027t want to miss it because of you.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah blanched. \u0027Neither would I. Want you to miss it, that is. Because of me.\u0027\\n\\n Outside the chateau\u0027s garage, Billy Kong popped one of I the BMW\u0027s boots, hefting the golf bag inside. It was the car with the tinted windows.\\n\\n Artemis opened his mouth to issue an order, then closed it again. Holly probably knew what to do.\\n\\n She did. The driver\u0027s door clunked open a fraction, apparently all on its own, then closed again. Before Minerva or Billy Kong could do more than blink in surprise, the four-by-four started up and laid down a six-metre length of rubber skidding towards the main gate.\\n\\n \u0027Perfect,\u0027 said Artemis under his breath. \u0027Now, Miss Minerva Paradizo, would-be criminal mastermind, let us see exactly how smart you are. I know what I would do in this situation.\u0027\\n\\n Minerva Paradizo\u0027s reaction was a bit less dramatic than one might expect from a child who has just had her prize possession stolen. There were no tantrums or foot-stamping. Billy Kong also defied expectations. He did not so much as draw a weapon. Instead he squatted on his hunkers, ran his fingers through Manga hair and lit a cigarette, which Minerva promptly plucked from his lips and squashed underfoot.\\n\\n Meanwhile the four-by-four was getting away, barrelling towards the main gates. Perhaps Minerva was confident that the reinforced steel barrier would be sufficient to halt the BMW in its tracks. She was wrong. Holly had already weak-ened the bolts with her Neutrino. One tap from the vehicle\u0027s grille would be more than sufficient to barge the gates out of the way. If it got that far. Which it did not.\\n\\n After she had crushed Kong\u0027s cigarette, Minerva took a remote control from her pocket, tapped in a short code, then hit the \u0027Send\u0027 button. In the BMW\u0027s cab, a tiny charge detonated in the airflow system, releasing a cloud of sevoflurane, a potent sleeping gas. In seconds, the vehicle began to weave, ramping the driveway bushes and cutting a swathe through the manicured lawn.\\n\\n \u0027Problems,\u0027 said Butler.\\n\\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027A gas device, I would guess. Fast-acting. Possibly cyclopropane or sevoflurane.\u0027\\n\\n Butler knelt, drawing his pistol. \u0027Should I stroll in there and get them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. You shouldn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n The BMW was careering wildly now, following the dips and slopes of the grounds\u0027 topography. It destroyed a mini-golf green, pulverized a gazebo and decapitated a centaur statue.\\n\\n Hundreds of miles below ground, Foaly winced.\\n\\n The vehicle finally came to rest in a lavender bed, nose down, rear wheels spinning, spitting out hunks of clay and uprooted long-stemmed purple flowers, like missiles.\\n\\n Nice action, thought Mulch, but he kept the notion to himself, fully aware that this might not be the time to stretch Butler\u0027s patience.\\n\\n Butler was raring to go. His gun was out and the tendons in his neck were stretched, but Artemis held him back with a touch to the forearm.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027Not now. I know your impulse4s to help, but now is not the time.\u0027\\n\\n The bodyguard jammed his Sig Sauer handgun back into its holster, scowling. \u0027Are you sure, Artemis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Trust me, old friend.\u0027\\n\\n And of course, Butler did, even if his instincts were not so sure.\\n\\n Inside the grounds, a dozen security guards were warily approaching the vehicle, led by Billy Kong. The man moved like a cat, on the balls of his feet. Even his face was feline, smug grin and flat eyes.\\n\\n On his signal, the men rushed the car, reclaiming the golf bag and hauling an unconscious Holly from the front seat. The elf was cuffed with plastic ties and hauled across the garden to where Minerva Paradizo and her father stood waiting.\\n\\n Minerva removed Holly\u0027s helmet and kneeled to exam-ine her pointed ears. Through his binocular lenses, Artemis could clearly see that she was smiling.\\n\\n It had been a trap. AH a trap.\\n\\n Minerva tucked the helmet under her arm, then walked briskly back towards the house. Halfway there, she stopped and turned. Shielding her eyes from the sun\u0027s glare, she scanned the shadows and peaks of the surrounding hillsides.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s she looking for?\u0027 Butler speculated aloud.\\n\\n Artemis did not wonder. He knew exactly what this surprising girl was after.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s looking for us, old friend. If that was your chateau, perhaps you might have wondered where a spy would conceal himself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course. And that\u0027s why I picked this spot. The ideal location would have been further up the hill, in that clus-ter of rocks, but that would also have been the first spot any security expert would booby-trap. This would be my second choice, and so, my first choice.\u0027\\n\\n Minerva\u0027s gaze swept past the rock cluster and rested on the line of bushes where they were hiding. She couldn\u0027t possibly see them, but her intellect told her that they were there.\\n\\n Artemis focused on the girl\u0027s pretty face. It amazed him that he could appreciate Minerva\u0027s features, even as his friend was being hauled into captivity. Puberty was a power-ful force.\\n\\n Minerva was smiling. Her eyes were bright and they taunted Artemis across the vale between them. She spoke in English then. Artemis and Butler, both expert lip-readers, had no difficulty interpreting her short sentence.\\n\\n \u0027Did you get that, Artemis?\u0027 asked Butler.\\n\\n \u0027I got it. And she got us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your move, Artemis Fowl,\u0027 Minerva had said.\\n\\n Butler sat back in the ditch, slapping mud from his elbows.\\n\\n \u0027I thought you were one of a kind, Artemis, but that girl is a smart one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Artemis, musing. \u0027She\u0027s a regular juvenile criminal mastermind.\u0027\\n\\n Below ground, in Section 8 HQ, Foaly groaned into his microphone.\\n\\n \u0027Great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now there are two of you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/213.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
