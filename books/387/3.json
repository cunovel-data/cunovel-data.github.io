{"id":40836,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 First Impression","content":"the island of hybras, LIMBOONE night, Imp No.l dreamed he was a demon. He dreamed his horns were curved and pointed. His hide was coarse and armoured, and his talons were sharp enough to rip the hide from a wild boar\u0027s back. He dreamed the other demons cowered before him, then scurried away lest he injure them while in the throes of his battle spasms. That night he dreamed this magnificent dream, then awoke to find he was still merely an imp. Of course tech-nically he did not have this dream at night. The sky over Hybras is forever tinged with the red glow of dawn. But No.l thought of his rest period as night, even though he\u0027d never seen one. Imp No.l dressed quickly, rushing into the hallway to check his reflection in the lodge mirror, just in case he had warped in his sleep. But there was no change. Still the same unimpressive figure as usual. One hundred per cent imp. \u0027Grrr,\u0027 he said to his image. And even the No.l in the mirror was unconvinced. And if he couldn\u0027t scare himself, then he was not a scary creature and might as well get a job changing baby imps. There was some potential in the mirror. Imp No.l had the general skeletal structure of a proper demon. He was about the same height as a sheep sitting on its rear. His skin was grey as moon dust and pebbled with armoured plating. Spiralling red runes wound their way round his chest, up along his neck and across his forehead. His eyes had striking orange irises, and his jaw had a noble jut about it, or so he liked to think, though others had called it protruding. He had two arms, slightly longer than an aver-age human ten-year-old, and two legs, slightly shorter. Fingers and toes: eight of each. So nothing weird there. One tail, more of a stump, actually, but excellent for burrowing holes if you\u0027re hunting for grubs. All in all, your typical imp. But at fourteen years old, the oldest imp in Hybras. Roughly fourteen years old, that is. It was hard to be exact when it was always dawn. The hour of power as the warlocks used to call it, before they got sucked into the depths of cold space. The hour of power. Very catchy. Hadley Shrivelington Basset, a demon who was actually six months N°l \u0027s junior, but already fully fledged, strolled down the tiled corridor on his way to the washroom. His horns corkscrewed impressively and his ears had at least four points. Hadley enjoyed parading his new demon self in front of the imps. Generally demons shouldn\u0027t even bunk in the imp lodge, but Basset seemed in no hurry to move out. \u0027Hey, imp,\u0027 he said, snapping his towel at No.l\u0027s behind. It connected with a sharp crack. \u0027Are you going to warp any time soon? Maybe if I get you angry enough.\u0027 The towel stung, but No.l didn\u0027t get angry. Just nerv-ous. Everything made him nervous. That was his problem. Time for a quick subject change. \u0027Morning, Basset. Nice ears. \u0027I know,\u0027 said Hadley, tipping the points one after another. \u0027Four points already and I think there\u0027s a fifth coming up. Abbot himself only has six points.\u0027 Leon Abbot, the hero of Hybras. The demons\u0027 self-proclaimed saviour. Hadley snapped No.l again with the towel. \u0027Don\u0027t you get a pain in your face, looking in the mirror, imp? Because you\u0027re giving me a pain in mine.\u0027 He put his hands on his hips, threw back his head and laughed. It was all very dramatic. You\u0027d think there was an artist in the wings doing sketches. \u0027Eh, Basset. You\u0027re not wearing any silver.\u0027 The laughing stopped, to be replaced by a froglike gurgle. Shrivelington Basset bolted down the lodge corri-dor without pause for more bullying. No.l knew scaring people half to death shouldn\u0027t give him any satisfaction, and generally it wouldn\u0027t. But for Basset, he\u0027d make an exception. Not wearing silver on your person is much more than a fashion disaster for a demon or imp. For them it can be fatal, or worse. Painful for all eternity. This rule usually only applied by the volcano crater, but luckily Basset was too scared to remember that. No.l ducked back into the senior imp dorm, hoping his room-mates were still snoring. No such luck. They were knuckling the sleep from their eyes and already searching for the target of their daily ribbing, which was of course him. He was by far the oldest in the senior dorm — no one else had made it to fourteen without warping. It was getting to the point where he was a permanent fixture. Each night his legs protruded from the foot of the bed, and his blan-ket barely covered the swirling moon markings on his chest. \u0027Hey, Runt,\u0027 called one. \u0027Are you going to warp today, do you think? Or will pink flowers grow out of my armpits?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll check your armpits tomorrow,\u0027 sniggered another. More abuse. This time from a couple of twelve-year-old imps who were so pumped up that they were likely to warp before class. But they were right. He would have gone for the pink flowers option too. Runt was his imp nickname. They didn\u0027t have real names, not until after they warped. Then they would be given a name from the sacred text. Until that moment, he was stuck with No.l or Runt. He smiled good-naturedly. It didn\u0027t pay to antagonize his dorm-mates. Even though they were smaller than him today, they could be a lot bigger tomorrow. \u0027I\u0027m feeling pumped,\u0027 he said, flexing his biceps. \u0027Today is going to be my day.\u0027 Everyone in the dorm was excited. Tomorrow they could be out of this room for good. Once they warped they were transferred to decent accommodation and nothing in Hybras was off-limits. \u0027Who do we hate?\u0027 shouted one. \u0027Humans!\u0027 came the reply. The next minute or so was spent howling at the ceil-ing. Imp No.l joined in, but he wasn\u0027t really feeling it. It shouldn\u0027t be \u0027who do we hate\u0027, he thought. It really should be \u0027whom\u0027. But this probably wasn\u0027t a good time to bring that up. Imp school Sometimes No.l wished he had known his mother. This was not a very demonlike desire, so he kept it to himself. Demons were born equal, and whatever they made of them-selves, they did with their claws and teeth. As soon as the female laid an egg, it was tossed in a bucket of mineral-enriched mud and left to hatch. Imps never knew who their families were, and therefore everyone was their family. But still, some days, when his self-esteem had taken a bit of a pounding, No.l couldn\u0027t help gazing wistfully across at the female compound on his way to school and wonder-ing which one was his mother. There was one demoness with red markings like his own and a kind face. Often she smiled across the wall at him. She was looking for her son, No.l suddenly realized. And from that day he smiled back. They could both pretend to have found each other. No.1 had never experienced a feeling of belonging. He ached for the time when he could wake up and look forward to what lay ahead. That day hadn\u0027t come yet, and it wasn\u0027t likely to, not for as long as they lived in Limbo. Nothing would change. Nothing could change. Well, that wasn\u0027t strictly true. Things could get worse. Imp School was a low stone building with little ventila-tion and hardly any light. Perfect for most imps. The stench and the smoky fire made them feel hard done by and warlike. No.l longed for light and fresh air. He was uniquely different, a brand-new point on the compass. Or maybe an old one. No.l often thought that perhaps he could be a warlock. True, there hadn\u0027t been a warlock in the demon pride since they lifted out of time, but maybe he was the first, and that was why he felt so differently about almost everything. No.1 had raised his theory with Master Rawley, but the teacher had cuffed his earhole and sent him digging grubs for the other imps. There was another thing. Why couldn\u0027t they, just once, have a cooked meal? What would be so horrible about a soft stew and maybe even a few spices? Why did imps delight in chomping their food down before it stopped wriggling? As usual, No.l was the last to school. The other dozen or so imps were already in the hall, revelling in the thoughts of another day spent hunting, skinning, butchering and possibly even warping. No.l wasn\u0027t feeling particularly hopeful. Maybe today would be his day, but he doubted it. The warp spasm was brought on by bloodlust, and No.l had never felt the slightest urge to hurt any other creature. He even felt bad for the rabbits he ate and sometimes dreamed that their little spirits were haunting him. Master Rawley sat at his bench sharpening a curved sword. Every now and then he would hack a chunk from the bench and grunt with satisfaction. The desk\u0027s surface was littered with various weapons for hacking, sawing and cutting. And, of course, one book. A copy of Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow. The book Leon Abbot had brought back from the old world. The book that would save them all, according to Abbot himself. When Rawley had sharpened the blade to a silver cres-cent, he banged the hilt of the weapon on his bench. \u0027Sit down,\u0027 he roared at the imps. \u0027And make it fast, you shower of stinking rabbit droppings. I\u0027ve got a fresh blade here that I\u0027m just itching to test.\u0027 The imps hurried to their places. Rawley would not cut them, but he was certainly not above strapping their backs with the flat of his sword. And then again, maybe he would cut them. No.l squashed in on the end of the fourth row. Look tough, he told himself. Sneer a bit.You\u0027re an imp! Rawley sank his blade into the wood, leaving it there quivering. The other imps grunted. Impressed. All No.l could think was: Show off. And: He\u0027s ruined that bench. \u0027So, pig slime,\u0027 said Rawley. \u0027You want to be demons, do you?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Master Rawley!\u0027 roared the imps. \u0027You think you have what it takes?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Master Rawley!\u0027 Rawley spread his muscled arms wide. He threw back a green head and roared. \u0027Well then, let me hear it!\u0027 The imps screamed and stomped, bashed their desks with weapons and clattered each other on the shoulders. No.l avoided as much of the consternation as possible while doing his best to seem involved. Not an easy trick. Finally Rawley settled them down. \u0027Well, we\u0027ll see. This morning is a big morning for some of you, but for others it will be just one more day of dishonour, grub-hunting with the females.\u0027 He stared pointedly at No.l. \u0027But before we get to oozing, we have to do some snoozing.\u0027 Much groaning from the imps. \u0027That\u0027s right, girls. History time. Nothing to kill and nothing to eat, just knowledge for the sake of it.\u0027 Rawley shrugged his giant knotted shoulders. \u0027It\u0027s a waste of time, if you ask me. But I\u0027m under orders here.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right, Master Rawley,\u0027 said a voice from the door-way. \u0027You\u0027re under orders.\u0027 The voice belonged to Leon Abbot himself, paying one of his surprise visits to the school. Abbot was immediately surrounded by adoring imps, clamouring to receive a friendly cuff on the ear, or to touch his sword. Abbot endured this adoration for a moment, then brushed the imps aside. He elbowed Rawley out of the prime spot at the head of the class, then waited for silence. He didn\u0027t have to wait long. Abbot was an impressive spec-imen, even if you didn\u0027t know a thing about his past. He was almost five feet tall, with curved ram horns that jutted from his forehead. His armoured scales were deep red and covered his entire torso and forehead. Very impressive, and of course difficult to penetrate. You could bash away with an axe all day at Abbot\u0027s chest and get nowhere. Indeed one of his party tricks was to challenge anyone in the room to hurt him. Abbot threw back his rawhide cloak and slapped his chest. \u0027Right, who wants to have a go?\u0027 Several imps nearly warped right then and there. \u0027Make a line, ladies,\u0027 said Rawley, as if he was still in control. The imps piled to the head of the class, hammering Abbot with fist, foot and forehead. They bounced off, every one. Much to Abbot\u0027s amusement. Idiots, thought No.l. As if they could possibly succeed. Actually, No.l had a theory about armoured scales. A few years ago he had been toying with a discarded baby armoured scale and he\u0027d noticed that they were made of dozens of layers, which made them almost impossible to breach head on, whereas if you went at them at an angle with something hot… \u0027What about you, Runt?\u0027 The raucous laughter of his classmates stomped all over No.l\u0027s thoughts. No.l physically twitched with shock as he realized that not only had Leon Abbot spoken to him, he had actually used his dormitory nickname. \u0027Yessir, pardon me? What?\u0027 Abbot thumped his own chest. \u0027You think you can get through the thickest plates on Hybras?\u0027 \u0027I doubt they\u0027re the thickest,\u0027 said No.l \u0027s mouth, before his brain had a chance to catch up. \u0027Raahhr!\u0027 roared Abbot, or something similar. \u0027Are you insulting me, impling?\u0027 Being called impling was even worse than being called Runt. The term \u0027impling\u0027 was generally reserved for the recently hatched. \u0027No, no, of course not, Master Abbot. I just thought that, naturally, some of the older demons would have more layers on their scales. But yours are probably tougher — no dead layers on the inside.\u0027 Abbot\u0027s slitted eyes squinted at No.l. \u0027You seem to know a lot about scales. Why don\u0027t you try to get through these?\u0027 No.l tried to laugh it off. \u0027Oh, I really don\u0027t think…\u0027 But Abbot wasn\u0027t even smiling. \u0027I really do think, Runt. Get your stumpy tail up here before I give Master Rawley licence to do what he has wanted to do for a long time.\u0027 Rawley pulled his blade from the bench and winked at No.l .This was not a friendly you-and-I-share-a-secret wink, it was a let\u0027s-see-what-colour-your-insides-are wink. No.l sloped reluctantly to the head of the class, passing the smouldering embers of last night\u0027s fire. Wooden meat skewers jutted from the coals. No.l paused for a beat, gazing at the sharp skewers. Thinking that if he had the guts, one of those would probably do the trick. Abbot followed his gaze. \u0027What?You think a meat skewer is going to help you?\u0027 The demon snorted. \u0027I was buried in molten lava once, Runt, and I\u0027m still here. Bring one up. Do your worst.\u0027 \u0027Do your worst,\u0027 echoed several of No.l\u0027s classmates, their loyalties obvious. N°l reluctantly selected a wooden needle from the fire. The handle was solid enough, but the tip was black and flaky. No.l tapped the skewer against his leg to dislodge loose ash. Abbot grabbed the meat skewer from No.l \u0027s hand, hold-ing it aloft. \u0027This is your chosen weapon,\u0027 he said mockingly. \u0027The Runt thinks he\u0027s hunting rabbits.\u0027 The jeers and hoots broke over No.l\u0027s furrowed brow like a wave. He could feel one of his headaches coming on. He could always count on one to show up just when it was least wanted. \u0027This is probably a bad idea,\u0027 he admitted. T should just pound on your armoured plates like those other morons… I mean, my classmates.\u0027 \u0027No, no,\u0027 said Abbot, handing back the skewer. \u0027You go ahead, little bee, prick me with your sting.\u0027 Prick me with your sting, warbled No.l in a highly insult-ing imitation of the pride leader. Of course he didn\u0027t warble this aloud. No.l was rarely confrontational outside his head. Aloud he said, \u0027I\u0027ll do my best, Master Abbot.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll do my best, Master Abbot,\u0027 warbled Abbot in a highly insulting imitation of Imp No.l, as loudly as he could. No.l felt beads of sweat spiral down his stumpy tail. There really was no good way out of this situation. If he failed, then he was in for another bout of jeering and mild personal injury. But if he won, then he really lost. Abbot knocked on the crown of his head. \u0027Hello, Runt. Let\u0027s get moving. There are imps here waiting to warp.\u0027 No.l stared at the tip of the skewer and allowed the problem to take over. He placed the flat of his right hand on Abbot\u0027s chest. Then wrapping his fingers tightly round the thick end, he twisted the skewer upwards into one of Abbot\u0027s armoured scales. He twisted slowly, concentrating on the point of contact. The scale greyed slightly with ash, but no penetration. Acrid smoke twirled round the skewer. Abbot chuckled, delighted. \u0027Trying to start a fire there, Runt? Should I summon the water brigade?\u0027 One of the imps threw his lunch at No.1. It slid down the back of his head. A lump of fat, bone and gristle. No.l persisted, rolling the skewer between thumb and forefinger. He rolled faster now, feeling the skewer take hold, burning a slight indent. No.l felt an excitement build in him. He tried to contain it, think about consequences, but he couldn\u0027t. He was on the point of success here. He was just about to accomplish with brains something all these other idiots couldn\u0027t do with brawn. Of course they would pummel him, and Abbot would invent some excuse to undermine his achievement, but No.l would know. And so would Abbot. The skewer penetrated, just a fraction. No.l felt the plate give way, perhaps a single layer. The little imp felt some-thing he had never felt before. Triumph. The feeling built inside him, irresistible, unquenchable. It became more than a feeling. It transformed into a force, rebuilding some forgotten neural pathways, releasing an ancient energy inside No.l. What\u0027s happening? wondered No.l. Should I stop? Can I stop? Yes and no were the answers to those questions. Yes, he should stop, but no, he couldn\u0027t. The force flowed through his limbs, raising his temperature. He heard voices chant-ing inside his mind. No.l realized that he was chanting with them. Chanting what? He had no idea, but somehow his memory knew. The strange force throbbed in No.l\u0027s fingers, in time with his heartbeat, then pulsed out of his body into the skewer. The pin turned to stone. Wood morphed to gran-ite before his eyes. The rock virus spread along the shaft, rippling like water. In the flash of a spark, the skewer was completely made of stone. It expanded slightly into the breach in Abbot\u0027s armoured plate. The expansion cracked the plate open a couple of centimetres. Abbot heard the noise; so did everybody else. The demon pride leader flicked his eyes downwards and realized instantly what was going on. \u0027Magic,\u0027 he hissed. The word was out before he could stop it. With a vicious swipe, he swatted the skewer away from his torso, into the fire. No.l stared at his throbbing hand. Power still shimmered around his fingertips, a tiny heat haze. \u0027Magic?\u0027 he repeated. \u0027That means I must be a…\u0027 \u0027Shut your stupid mouth,\u0027 snapped Abbot, covering the cracked scale with his cloak. \u0027Obviously I don\u0027t mean actual magic. I mean trickery. You twist the handle on that skewer to make it crack, then you ooh and aah as though you have actually achieved something.\u0027 No.l pulled at Abbot\u0027s cloak. \u0027But your scale?\u0027 Abbot drew the cloak tighter. \u0027What about my scale? There\u0027s not a mark on it. Not so much as a smear. You believe me, don\u0027t you?\u0027 No.l sighed. This was Leon Abbot; the truth meant noth-ing. \u0027Yes, Master Abbot. I believe you.\u0027 \u0027I can tell by your insolent tone that you do not. Very well, proof then.\u0027 Abbot whipped back his cloak, revealing an unblemished scale. For a moment, No.l thought he saw a blue spark playing about where the mark had definitely been, but then the spark winked itself out. Blue sparks. Could it be magic? Abbot jabbed the imp\u0027s chest with a rigid finger. \u0027We\u0027ve talked about this, Number One. I know you think you\u0027re a warlock. But there are no warlocks, there haven\u0027t been since we lifted out of time. You are not a warlock. Forget that idiotic notion and concentrate on warping. You\u0027re a disgrace to your race.\u0027 No.l was about to risk a protest, when he was grabbed roughly by the arm. \u0027You slippery little snail,\u0027 shouted Rawley, spittle spat-tering No.l\u0027s face. \u0027Trying to trick the pride leader. Get back to your place. I\u0027ll deal with you later.\u0027 No.l could do nothing but return to the bench and bear the insults of his classmates. And there were plenty of those, usually accompanied by a missile or blow. But somehow No.l ignored these latest humiliations, staring instead at his own hand. The one that had turned wood to stone. Could it be true? Could he actually be a warlock? And if he was, would that make him feel better, or worse? A toothpick bounced off his forehead on to the bench. There was a sliver of grey meat stuck to the end. No.l glanced up to find Rawley grinning at him. \u0027Been trying to get that out for weeks. Wild boar, I think. Now, pay attention, Runt, Master Abbot is trying to educate you.\u0027 Oh yes, the history lesson. It was amazing how much Leon Abbot managed to insert himself into demon history. To hear him tell it, you would think that he had single-handedly saved the eighth family, in spite of the meddling warlocks. Abbot studied the hooked talons on his fingertips. Each one could gut a large pig. If Abbot\u0027s own stories were true, he had warped at age eight while wrestling one of the island\u0027s wild dogs. His fingernails had actually changed into talons during the fight, lacerating the dog\u0027s side. No.l found this story highly unlikely. It took hours to warp fully, sometimes days, but Abbot expected them to believe that his warp was instantaneous. Hogwash. And yet all the other imps lapped up these self-glorifying legends. \u0027Of all the demons who fought in the last battle atTaillte,\u0027 droned Abbot, in what he probably thought was a good voice for history lessons, but in what No.l thought was a boring enough voice to turn soft cheese hard. \u0027I, Leon Abbot, am the last.\u0027 Convenient, thought No.l. Nobody left around to argue. He also thought: You look your age, Leon. Too many barrels of pork fat. No.l was an uncharitable imp when in a bad mood. It is the nature of out of time spells that the ageing process is drastically slowed. Abbot had been a young buck when the warlocks lifted Hybras out of time, and so the spell, combined with good genes, had kept him and his huge ego alive ever since. Possibly a thousand years. Of course, that was a thousand years normal time. In Hybras time, a millen-nium meant very little. A couple of centuries could skip by in the blink of an eye on the island. An imp could wake up one morning to find that he\u0027d evolved. A while back, every demon and imp in Hybras got up one morning with a stubby tail where his magnificent long one used to be. For a considerable time after that, the most common noises on the island were the sounds of demons falling down, or swearing as they got up again. \u0027After that great battle, in which the demon battalions were the bravest and fiercest in the People\u0027s army,\u0027 contin-ued Abbot, to hoots of approval from the imps, \u0027we were defeated by treachery and cowardice. The elves would not fight, and the dwarfs would not dig traps. We had no choice but to cast our spell and regroup until the time was right to return.\u0027 More hooting, plus stamping of feet. Every time, thought No.l. Do we have to go through this every time? These imps act like they never heard this story before. When is someone going to stand up and say: \u0027Excuse me. Old news. Move on! \u0027And so we breed. We breed and grow strong. Now our army has over five thousand warriors — surely enough to defeat the humans. I know this, because I, Leon Abbot, have been to the world and returned to Hybras alive.\u0027 This was Abbot\u0027s golden nugget. This was where anyone who stood against him withered and blew away. Abbot had not come directly to Limbo with the rest of Hybras. For some reason he had been diverted to the human future, then sucked across to Hybras. He had seen the human camps and actually brought his knowledge home. How all this happened was a bit hazy. According to Abbot there had been a great battle, he\u0027d defeated fifty or so men, then a mysterious warlock had lifted him out of time again. But not before he\u0027d grabbed a couple of things to bring back. Since the warlocks had been explosively removed from the eighth family, nobody had much of a clue about magic any more. Normal demons had no magic of their own. It had been thought that all the warlocks had been sucked into space during the transferral of Hybras from Earth to Limbo, but according to Abbot, one had survived. This warlock was in league with the humans and had only helped the demon leader under threat of grievous injury. No.l was highly sceptical of this version of events. First of all, because it came from Abbot, and secondly because warlocks were being cast, once more, in a bad light. Demons seemed to forget that if it wasn\u0027t for the warlocks, Hybras would have been overrun by humans. On this particular day, No.l was feeling a special attach-ment to the warlocks, and he did not appreciate their memory being sullied by this loudmouth braggart. Hardly a day went past where No.l did not spend a moment pray-ing for the return of the mysterious warlock who had helped Abbot. And now that he was certain of magic in his own blood, N°l would pray all the harder. \u0027The moon separated me from the rest of the island during the great journey,\u0027 continued Abbot, his eyes half closed as if the memory had him in a swoon. \u0027I was power-less to resist her charms. And so I travelled through space and time until I came to rest in the new world. Which is now the world of men. The humans clamped silver on my ankles, tried to make me submit, but I would not.\u0027 Abbot hunched his massive shoulders and roared at the roof. \u0027For I am demonkind! And we will never submit!\u0027 Needless to say the imps went into overdrive. The entire room heaved with their exertions. In No.l\u0027s opinion, Abbot\u0027s entire performance was wooden, to say the least. The we will never submit speech was the oldest page in Abbot\u0027s book. No.l rubbed his temples, trying to ease the headache. There was worse to come, he knew. First the book, then the crossbow, if Abbot didn\u0027t deviate from the script. And why would he? He hadn\u0027t in all the years since his return from the new world. \u0027And so I fought!\u0027 shouted Abbot. \u0027I kicked off their shackles and Hybras called me home, but before I took my leave of the hated humans, I fought my way to their altar and stole away with two of their blessed objects.\u0027 \u0027The book and the bow,\u0027 muttered No.l, rolling his orange eyes. \u0027Tell us what you stole,\u0027 begged the others on cue, as if they didn\u0027t know. \u0027The book and the bow!\u0027 proclaimed Leon Abbot, pulling the objects from beneath his robe, as if by magic. As if by magic, thought No.l. But not actual magic, because then Abbot would be a warlock, and he couldn\u0027t possibly be a warlock as he had already warped and warlocks did not warp. \u0027Now we know how the humans think,\u0027 said Abbot, waving the book. \u0027And how they fight,\u0027 he proclaimed, bran-dishing the crossbow. / don\u0027t believe any of this for a minute, thought No.l. Or I wouldn\u0027t, if we had \u0027minutes\u0027 in Limbo. Oh, how I wish 1 was on Earth, with the last warlock. Then there would be two of us, and I would find out what really happened when Leon Abbot came calling. \u0027And armed with this knowledge, we can return when the time spell fades and retake the old country.\u0027 \u0027When?\u0027 cried the imps. \u0027When?\u0027 \u0027Soon,\u0027 replied Abbot. \u0027Soon. And there will be humans enough for us all. They will be crushed like the grass beneath our boots. We will tear their heads off like dandelion flowers.\u0027 Oh, please, thought No.1. Enough plant similes. It was quite possible that No.l was the only creature on Hybras who ever even thought the human word \u0027simile\u0027. Saying it aloud would have certainly earned him a thrash-ing. If the other imps knew that his human vocabulary also included words like \u0027grooming\u0027 and \u0027decoration\u0027 they would string him up for sure. Ironically he had learned these words from Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow, which was supposed to be a school text. \u0027Tear their heads off,\u0027 shouted one imp, and it quickly became a chant, taken up by everyone in the room. \u0027Yes, tear their heads off,\u0027 said No.l, trying it out, but there was no feeling in his voice. What\u0027s my motivation? he wondered. I\u0027ve never even met a human. The imps climbed on their benches, bobbing in primal rhythm. \u0027Tear their heads off! Tear their heads off!\u0027 Abbot and Rawley urged them on. Flexing their claws and howling. A sickly sweet smell clogged the air. Warp muck. Someone was entering the warp spasm phase. The excitement was bringing on the change. No.l felt nothing. Not so much as a twinge. He tried his best, squeezing his eyelids together, letting the pressure build in his head, thinking bloody thoughts. But his true feelings shattered the false visions of bloodlust and carnage. It\u0027s no use, he thought. / am not that kind of demon. No.l stopped chanting and sat, head in hands. No point in pretending — another change cycle was passing him by. Not so the other imps. Abbot\u0027s theatrics had opened a natural well of testosterone, bloodlust and bodily fluid. One by one, they succumbed to the warp spasm. Green gunge flowed from their pores, slowly at first, then in bubbling gushes. They all went under, every one of them. It must be some kind of record, so many imps warping simultaneously. Of course Abbot would take the credit. The sight of the fluid brought on fresh rounds of howl-ing. And the more the imps howled, the faster the gunge spurted. No.l had heard it said that humans took several years to make the transition from childhood to adulthood. Imps did it in a few hours. And a change like that is going to hurt. The howls of exultation changed to grunts of pain, as bones stretched and horns curled, the gunge-coated limbs already lengthening. The smell was sweet enough to make N°l gag. Imps toppled to the floor all around. They thrashed for a few seconds, then their own fluids mummified them. They were cocooned like enormous green bugs, strapped tight by the hardening gunge. The schoolroom was suddenly silent, except for the crack of drying nutrient fluid and a rustle of flames from the stone fireplace. Abbot beamed, a toothy smile that seemed to split his head in half. \u0027A good morning\u0027s work, wouldn\u0027t you say, Rawley? I got them all warping.\u0027 Rawley grunted his agreement, then noticed No.l. \u0027Except the Runt.\u0027 \u0027Well, of course not,\u0027 began Abbot, then caught himself. \u0027Yes. Absolutely, except the Runt.\u0027 No.l\u0027s forehead burned under Rawley and Abbot\u0027s scrutiny. \u0027I want to warp,\u0027 he said, looking at his fingers. \u0027I really do. But it\u0027s the hating thing. I just can\u0027t manage it. And all that slime. Even the thought of that stuff all over me makes me feel a bit nauseous.\u0027 \u0027A bit what?\u0027 said Rawley suspiciously. No.l realized that he needed to dumb it down for his teacher. \u0027Sick. A bit sick.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 Rawley shook his head in disgust. \u0027Slime makes you sick? What kind of imp are you? The others live for slime.\u0027 No.l took a deep breath and said something aloud that he had known for a long time. \u0027I\u0027m not like the others.\u0027 No.l\u0027s voice trembled. He was on the verge of tears. \u0027Are you going to cry?\u0027 asked Rawley, his eyes bugging. \u0027This is too much, Leon. He\u0027s going to cry now, just like a female. I give up.\u0027 Abbot scratched his chin. \u0027Let me try something.\u0027 He rummaged in a cape pocket, surreptitiously fixing something over his hand. Oh no, thought No.l. Please no. Not Stony. Abbot raised a forearm, his cloak draped over it. A mini-stage. A puppet human poked his head over the leather cape. The puppet\u0027s head was a grotesque ball of painted clay, with a heavy forehead and clumsy features. No.l doubted that humans were this ugly in real life, but demons were not known for their artistic skills. Abbot often produced Stony as a visual incentive for those imps who were having difficulty warping. Needless to say, No.l had been introduced to the puppet before. \u0027Grrr,\u0027 said the puppet, or rather Abbot said, as he waggled the puppet. \u0027Grrr, my name is Stony the Mud Man.\u0027 \u0027Hello, Stony,\u0027 said No.l weakly. \u0027How\u0027ve you been?\u0027 The puppet held a tiny wooden sword in its hand. \u0027Never mind how I\u0027ve been. I don\u0027t care how you\u0027ve been, because I hate all fairies,\u0027 said Abbot in a squeaky voice. \u0027I drove them from their homes. And if they ever try to come back, I will kill them all.\u0027 Abbot lowered the puppet. \u0027Now, how does that make you feel?\u0027 It makes me feel that the wrong demon is in charge of the pride, thought No.l, but aloud he said, \u0027Eh, angry?\u0027 Abbot blinked. \u0027Angry? Really?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 confessed No.l, wringing his hands. \u0027I don\u0027t feel anything. It\u0027s a puppet. I can see your fingers through the material.\u0027 Abbot stuffed Stony back in his pocket. \u0027That\u0027s it. I\u0027ve had it with you, Number One. You will never earn a name from the book.\u0027 Once demons warped, they were given a human name from Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow. The logic being that learning the human language and possessing a human name would help the demon army think like humans and therefore defeat them. Abbot may have hated the Mud Men, but that wasn\u0027t to say he didn\u0027t admire them. Also, politi-cally, it was a good idea to have every demon on Hybras calling each other by names that Leon Abbot had procured for them. Rawley grabbed No.l\u0027s ear, dragging him from his seat to the rear of the classroom. A metal grille on the floor covered a shallow, pungent dung pit. \u0027Get to work, Runt,\u0027 he said gruffly. \u0027You know what to do.\u0027 No.l sighed. He knew only too well. This wasn\u0027t the first or second time he\u0027d had to endure this odious task. He hefted a long-handled gaff from a peg on the wall, pulling the heavy grille from its groove. The smell was rank but not unbearable, as a crust had formed on the dung\u0027s surface. Beetles crawled across the craggy skin, their legs clicking like claws on wood. No.l uncovered the pit completely, then selected his nearest classmate. There was no way of telling which class-mate it actually was because of the slime cocoon. The only movements were small air bubbles around the mouth and nose. At least he hoped it was the mouth and nose. No.1 bent low, rolling the cocoon along the floor and into the dung pit. The warping imp crashed through the crust, taking a dozen beetles with him into the muck below. A gush of dung stink washed over N° 1, and he knew his skin would smell for days. The others would wear their pit stink proudly, but for No.l it was just another badge of shame. It was arduous work. Not all the warping imps were still. Several struggled inside their cocoons, and twice demon claws punctured the green chrysalis centimetres from N°l\u0027s skin. He persisted, groaning loudly, in the hope that Rawley or Leon Abbot would lend a hand. It was a vain hope. The two demons were huddled at the head of the classroom, poring over Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow. Eventually, No.l rolled his last classmate into the dung pit. They were piled in there like meat in a thick stew. The nutrient-rich dung would accelerate their warp, ensuring they reached full potential. No.l sat on the stone floor, catching his breath. Lucky you, thought No.l. Dunked in dung. No.l tried to feel envious. But even being near the pit made him gag; the thought of being immersed in it, surrounded by cocooned imps, made his stomach churn. A shadow fell across the flagstones before him, flickering in the firelight. \u0027Ah, Number One,\u0027 said Abbot. \u0027Always an imp, never a demon, eh? What am I going to do with you?\u0027 No.l stared at his own feet, clicking baby talons on the floor. \u0027Master Abbot, sir. Don\u0027t you think? Isn\u0027t there the tini-est chance?\u0027 He took a deep breath and raised his eyes to meet Abbot\u0027s. \u0027Couldn\u0027t I be a warlock? You saw what happened with the skewer. I don\u0027t want to embarrass you, but you saw it.\u0027 Abbot\u0027s expression changed instantly. One second he was playing the genial master, the next his true colours shone through. \u0027I saw nothing,\u0027 he hissed, heaving No.l to his feet. \u0027Nothing happened, you odious little freak of nature. The skewer was coated with ash, nothing more. There was no transformation. No magic.\u0027 Abbot drew No.l close enough to see the slivers of trapped meat between his yellowed teeth. The next time he spoke, his voice seemed different somehow. Layered. As though an entire choir was singing in harmony. It was a voice that could not be ignored. Magical? \u0027If you are a warlock, then you should really be on the other side, with your relative. Wouldn\u0027t that be for the best? One quick leap, that\u0027s all it would take. Do you understand what I am saying to you, Runt?\u0027 No.l nodded, dazed. What a lovely voice. Where had that come from? The other side, of course; that\u0027s where he should go. One small step for an imp. \u0027I understand, sir.\u0027 \u0027Good. The subject is closed. As Lady Heatherington Smythe would say, \"Best foot forward, young sir, the world awaits.\"\u0027 No.l nodded, just as he knew Abbot wanted him to, but inside his brain churned along with his stomach. Was this to be the whole extent of his life? Forever mocked, forever different. Never a moment of light or hope. Unless he crossed over. Abbot\u0027s suggestion was his only hope. Cross over. No.l had never seen the appeal of jumping into a crater before, but now the notion seemed nigh on irresistible. He was a warlock, there couldn\u0027t be any doubt. And somewhere out there, in the human world, there was another like him. An ancient brother who could teach him the ways of his kind. N°l watched Abbot stride away from him. Off to exer-cise his power on some other part of the island, possibly by belittling the females in the compound - another of his favourite pastimes. Then again, how bad could Abbot be? After all, he had given No.l this wonderful idea. / cannot stay here, thought No.l. / must go to the volcano. The notion took firm hold of his brain. And in minutes it had drowned out all the other notions in his head. Go to the volcano. It pounded inside his skull, like waves breaking on the shore. Obey Abbot. Go to the volcano. No.l brushed the dust from his knees. \u0027You know what,\u0027 he muttered to himself in case Rawley could hear, \u0027I think I\u0027m going to the volcano.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/209.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
