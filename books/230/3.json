{"id":7080,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 The Wild Wood","content":"Such a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all! With illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple loosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow. Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.\n 当他们回顾夏天的一切时，就感到，那是多么绚丽多彩的一章啊！那里面有许多五色缤纷的插图。大河两岸，一支盛装的游行队伍在不停地庄严行进，展示出一场跟着一场富丽堂皇的景观。紫色的珍珠菜最先登场，抖开它那乱丝般丰美的秀发，垂挂在镜面般的河水边沿，镜中的脸，又冲它自己微笑。婀娜多姿的柳兰，犹如桃色的晚霞，紧跟着也上场了。雏菊，紫的和白的手牵着手，悄悄钻了上来，在队列中占取了一席地位。最后，在一个早晨，羞怯的野蔷薇姗姗来迟，轻盈地步上舞台。这时，就像弦乐以它辉煌的和弦转入一曲加沃特，向人们宣告，六月终于来到了。但是，戏班子里还缺一个角色没有到齐，那就是水仙女所追求的牧羊少年，闺秀们凭窗盼望的骑士，用亲吻唤醒沉睡的夏天的生命和爱情的王子。当身穿琥珀色紧身背心的笑靥菊，温文尔雅，芳香扑鼻，步履优美地登上舞台时，好戏就开场了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/259/2442.html","bookId":230,"book":{"id":230,"title":"柳林风声 The Wind in the Willows","description":"简介： 当在雪地里冷得直打哆嗦的鼹鼠和水鼠终于进到獾先生舒适的家，钻进带着肥皂香味的被窝；当他们第二天起床看见餐桌旁吃着荞麦粥的两只小刺猬时，当癞蛤蟆先生跳上令他心弛神往的那辆豪华汽车，轰隆一声发动引擎，然后扬长而去的那一刻。我们听着故事的眼睛都会迸出光芒，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110321/1-11032116045T57.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/259","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:19 AM"}}
