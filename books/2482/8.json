It felt good to be on the brink of something new and big. The fort was about to grow in a dynamic way. Taking the hotel would change everything.\\n\\n Unless they failed. But then again, that would change everything.\\n\\n “You be careful in there,” Juan said softly beside her. He was staring at her face as she chewed her chips. His finger lightly slid down the bridge of her nose. “Nothing crazy okay. I know you\u0027re loca, but try to curb your natural loca tendencies.”\\n\\n Jenni grinned at him. “I\u0027ll come back out alive. I\u0027ve got too much to live for. Like giving you hell and eating Doritos.” She popped another chip.\\n\\n He laughed and slid an arm around her waist.\\n\\n Jenni savored the flavor of the chip she was eating and the feel of Juan\u0027s arm around her. She had no intention of dying. There was no way in hell she was going to let a zombie get her. She had not survived this long to die. She now had Juan in her life and she wanted to be with him forever. She had a new family and a new life. That was worth fighting for. Looking toward the swarthy man with the dark green eyes, she grinned.\\n\\n “Let\u0027s go have sex,” she said to Juan, and shoved the bag into his hand. She swung her legs down onto the ladder leading into the construction site.\\n\\n “Uh, what? Okay!” Juan scrambled down after her.\\n\\n At the bottom, he caught her up in his arms and threw her over his shoulders. Both of them laughing, he carried her to their makeshift tent.\\n\\n Chapter 4\\n\\n 1. The New Season\\n\\n The sun was barely peeking over the edge of the fort\u0027s walls when Katie set out on her daily jog. Her hair was up in a ponytail and she wore a T-shirt and jogging shorts. For the first time, she was wearing her brand new jogging shoes. After Peggy and the Mayor had inventoried everything brought into the fort during the scavenging expeditions, they had meticulously laid out everything in large boxes or any other bin they could find, and opened up a sort of store for everyone in the basement. No currency was exchanged, but you had to sign out anything that was taken. Katie had been surprised to find a box full of jogging shoes and had managed to find a pair that fit.\\n\\n Katie started on her trek around the fort, enjoying the brisk morning air, feeling it nipping her checks bright red. She was trying to enjoy the cool morning air as much as she could before summer was in full swing and the mornings would be balmy.\\n\\n She was on her second rotation when Jenni dropped in beside her.\\n\\n She was dressed in jeans, a red tank top and her boots. Glowing with something other than the cool morning air, Jenni grinned at her.\\n\\n “Gawd, I think I hate you,” Katie said with a laugh. “Every freakin\u0027 night?”\\n\\n Jenni laughed and easily matched her pace. “Yeah, so?”\\n\\n “I almost feel bad for Juan,” Katie decided.\\n\\n “Yeah, I am pretty brutal. I don’t know how he puts up with me.”\\n\\n “You’re loca. And he loves loca,” Katie reminded her.\\n\\n Jenni lightly pumped her arms as they ran and her grin said it all.\\n\\n She was wonderfully in love and it made Katie happy for her.\\n\\n “You know, you kinda have options,” Jenni started cautiously.\\n\\n Katie shrugged. She debated opening up to Jenni or not. Her best friend could be terribly blunt and loud at times. If she confided in her, there was a good chance that everyone in the fort would know her business fairly quickly.\\n\\n Jenni frowned as they took another corner. “Haven\u0027t you ever kissed a boy?”\\n\\n That made Katie laugh out loud. “Lots, actually.” There it was out.\\n\\n She had said it.\\n\\n “Before you realized you were a lesbian?” Jenni raised her eyebrow.\\n\\n “I\u0027m not a lesbian,” Katie said with a smile, deciding to fess up.\\n\\n Jenni arched her eyebrows even higher. “Huh?”\\n\\n “I\u0027m bi,” Katie answered.\\n\\n “Huh?” Jenni looked utterly confused and almost ran into a pile of concrete bricks. Katie yanked her out of the way just in time. “You had a wife.”\\n\\n Katie nodded as they made the turn. “Yeah, but I\u0027m bisexual. That means I find both men and women attractive. I just happened to end up with a really fabulous gay woman instead of a really fabulous straight man. The odds usually work against that, but Lydia snatched me up.”\\n\\n Jenni’s eyes widened, her mouth dropped open, and she made an “oh” sound that lasted for a few seconds. She smacked Katie on the arm. “Then you do have options, you bitch! Travis!”\\n\\n Katie smacked her back. “Shut up!”\\n\\n “No, seriously! If you like both guys and girls, you have options!”\\n\\n Jenni had the mad gleam of a matchmaker in her eyes.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t want him to know I\u0027m bi or that I have some feelings for him,” Katie said firmly. She almost regretted telling her, but it felt good to say it out loud. “At least, not now.”\\n\\n “You have feelings for him?” Jenni grabbed Katie’s arm and dragged her to a stop. “Oh, my gawd! You have feelings for Travis!”\\n\\n “But he can’t know, so keep it down!”\\n\\n Jenni twisted up her face, confused. “Why not? I mean, I\u0027m relieved. I was afraid you\u0027d be alone for the rest of your life unless some hot lesbian came along.”\\n\\n Katie sighed. “Just because you put two lesbians in a room that does not mean they\u0027ll hook up. Well, unless you go with the second date Uhaul theory…\\n\\n “What\u0027s that?”\\n\\n “What does a lesbian bring to a second date?”\\n\\n “A Uhaul. That\u0027s funny!” Jenni giggled. “So lesbians move fast.”\\n\\n “That’s not what we\u0027re talking about!”\\n\\n “Okay, but I mean, well, you have options! You can have Travis!”\\n\\n Jenni was almost jumping up and down with excitement. “Katie, I’m so happy!”\\n\\n Katie felt her stomach tighten nervously. “I don\u0027t want options right now. I just…” She trailed off.\\n\\n “She\u0027s gone, Katie.”\\n\\n “I know. But I just can\u0027t forget her and move on. Even if I do…”\\n\\n Katie wiped a tear from her eye “…even if I do have feelings for Travis. I don\u0027t want to talk about this.”\\n\\n Jenni sighed. She reached out and touched Katie\u0027s shoulder gently.\\n\\n “I just want you happy. Is it wrong for you to be happy?”\\n\\n Katie shook her head. “I don\u0027t know if I can be without her. I loved her so much, Jenni. When I met her I just knew she was the one and when I met Travis-” She closed her eyes and shook her head.\\n\\n “What, Katie? Tell me.”\\n\\n “It felt…similar. Not exactly the same. But like he was important to me. To my future. Maybe I’m just admitting it to myself now, but-“ She couldn’t continue. Her emotions swirled up and she tried to focus herself.\\n\\n Jenni saw the tears in her eyes and threw her arms around Katie, nearly crashing them both into the ground. Katie grabbed hold of her and they hugged each other tightly.\\n\\n “It’s okay! It’s okay. At least you know that you’re not alone and that people do love you. And he’ll wait until you’re ready. You know that.”\\n\\n “I\u0027m so grateful I have you,” Katie whispered. She kissed Jenni’s cheek and clung to her. “You\u0027re a good friend.”\\n\\n Jenni stroked her hair and looked at her intently. “I love you, but I don\u0027t want you hurting so we\u0027ll drop this for now.”\\n\\n Katie nodded, smiling. “Okay. For now.”\\n\\n Travis walked up, looking a little grim, his hands in the pockets of his lightweight jacket. Katie couldn’t help but notice the bags under his eyes or his slightly mussed hair. He was carrying so much on his shoulders and she wanted to hug him. “We\u0027re going in today.\\n\\n According to what\u0027s left of the Internet there is a bad storm heading this way. Some survivors in a school several counties away are reporting that it\u0027s very, very bad. They lost power and had to go to their backup generator.”\\n\\n The women looked toward the row of generators, that up to this point they hadn\u0027t had to use, and winced.\\n\\n “So, we\u0027re going in. Get ready.” His gaze lingered on Katie.\\n\\n “I\u0027ll change and get Nerit,” Katie answered. She had this deep desire to hug him and let him know it was okay. That they would both be okay, but she couldn\u0027t let herself. Not yet.\\n\\n He nodded and walked on to inform the others.\\n\\n Jenni smacked Katie\u0027s shoulder. “He is so into you. Don’t keep him waiting too long!”\\n\\n Katie turned and glared at her. “You said-”\\n\\n “Gawd, yes, but-” Jenni threw up her hands. “He’s so hot!”\\n\\n Katie laughed despite herself and smacked Jenni’s shoulder. “Lay off. Okay? For now. For me.”\\n\\n “Fine, but we will talk about this later.” She kissed Katie hard on her cheek and strode off.\\n\\n Katie stood alone, her hands resting on her hips, and exhaled slowly. She glanced over at Travis and caught him looking at her. She gave him a soft smile and his face lit up as he smiled back at her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fighting-to-survive-as-the-world-dies-2/page-8.html","bookId":2482,"book":{"id":2482,"title":"Fighting to Survive (As the World Dies #2)","description":"Storyline: Fighting to Survive (As the World Dies #2) \\n Katie and Jenni have found new lives with the survivors of their makeshift fort, but danger still lurks.
