Peggy looked up and said shortly, “You’ll get room service if you get off your ass and come down to the kitchen and help out.” “Steven, speak to the woman. I do not converse with the help,” the woman, Blanche?Katie thought that was the woman’s name?said to her husband. “I demand a larger room more suited to our previous lifestyle,” Steven repeated. He looked adamant and quite fierce. “So those of us who lived in trailers should just get the shit rooms?” someone asked. Manny looked at the list. The Manns had heavily funded his last campaign and he was often seen talking to them. Old habits die hard. “Peggy, maybe we could…” “No, it was agreed upon.” Peggy held out the keys to Steven Mann with a insistent look on her face. “By vote. Rooms are granted according to need. A married couple only needs a king-sized bed, unless maybe the married couple would rather have two beds?” Peggy smiled sweetly, but her eyes were poisonous. “Well, I do have a rather bad ba?“ Blanche started to say. “Just what are you insinuating?” Steven looked ready to blow his temper. Travis appeared out of the crowd looking tired and annoyed. “Steven, take your keys and go to your room. The world that you loved so much is gone now. You’re now just one of us. A survivor. You hardly carry your weight so I think you’re damn lucky we don’t just make you sleep on a cot in the hallway.” There were murmurs of agreement. Steven grabbed the key and fastened his gaze on the Mayor. “I will remember this.” “You do realize,” Peggy said with a snarky smile, “there are no more elections to fund anymore.” “For now,” Steven snapped back. He grabbed his wife’s arm and dragged her off. “I don’t understand why you let them treat us this way,” Blanche said as she was lead through the decidedly hostile crowd. “They\u0027re just common people.” Travis shook his head. Katie looked down at Jack. “People are silly.” The German Shepherd thumped his tail in response and nudged her hand for more scratching. She obliged. Mike’s girlfriend, Belinda, sobbed when her name was called. Katarina helped her claim her key. The young Hispanic woman was Juan’s life long crush until Jenni had claimed his heart. Belinda looked frail and shell-shocked as Katarina lead her away. Losing Mike had been devastating to all of them, but Belinda was shattered. Jenni’s name was called a few minutes later and she came up to claim her key. Jason tagged along behind her looking surly. Katie realized why. Juan’s name had been called with theirs. It was their first public acknowledgment of what everyone already knew. Juan was absolutely beaming. “C’mere, Jack,” Jason called out. The dog gave Katie an apologetic look, then trotted off. “The Four J’s,” Travis said with a weary smile as he joined her. “Uh huh,” Katie answered. Jenni did look happy and taken care of. Juan helped her walk and Jason trudged along behind them, looking annoyed. Since they were considered a “family,” they had ended up with a small suite with two rooms. Eric and Stacey claimed their key together. Pepe danced around at their feet as the young couple kissed happily. Stacey had complained to Katie about the lack of privacy that haunted all the couples in the fort. Only Jenni and Juan seemed comfortable with everyone overhearing their business, or maybe they just didn’t think about it. When Nerit’s name was called, she walked forward, her dog in tow, and claimed her key. She looked very weary, like she wanted nothing more than to sleep. The older woman forced a smile as she passed them on her way to claim her things. “We’re finally inside,” Katie said to Travis in a low voice. “How does it feel?” Travis looked around at all the people gathered around them, then back at Katie. “Like the cost was high, but the right thing to do.” She nodded, then heard her name called. Moving forward, she smiled at Peggy. “I’m wanting to check in.” Peggy grinned. “I have your reservation. Room 718.” Katie lifted an eyebrow. “Kinda nice for just little ol’ me.” Peggy had a wicked gleam in her eye. “Uh, is it just you?” Katie gave her a look and dared not look at Travis. “Yes, it is. Thanks, Peggy.” Peggy just smiled and called out the next name. Moving through what remained of the crowd, Katie smiled at all the weary, stressed faces. She walked back into the construction site through the now cleaned up janitor’s room. Making her way up to the small room in the city hall, she ran into Nerit carrying her suitcase. She had her rifle over one arm and her dog leash in the other hand. “Nerit,” Katie said softly. “You were so amazing.” “I’m so tired,” Nerit answered truthfully. “I did my job. Now I want a bath and a nice bit of reading before bed.” Katie smiled. “You deserve a nice rest.” Nerit gave her a little hug and a kiss on the cheek. “I will see you in the morning.” “Night, Nerit,” Katie answered. Moving up the stairs and toward the small room she had once shared with Jenni, Katie found Juan picking up Jenni’s bag that she kept in Katie’s room, even though she slept in Juan\u0027s tent. “We just decided today,” he explained. “Life is so short. We just don’t’ want to waste time. We’ve been sleeping together in my tent. Might as well make it official and be a family.” Nodding, Katie smiled. “I get it. I understand and I think its great. I knew she would never move back in with me. Our time to be roomies is long gone.” Juan heaved the bag over his shoulder and picked up a smaller bag of items. “I really love her, Katie. She’s loca, but she’s my loca. I know her life was shitty before, I want to take care of her.” “I know, Juan. You don’t have to tell me this.” “Yeah, but I do. You’re her best friend, her sister. Other than Jason, you are her family. I just wanted you to know how I feel,” Juan said. “That I really love her.” Katie gave him a gentle hug. “And that makes me so very happy.” Juan looked almost embarrassed. “I’m glad. I know you like the chicas, but Travis?“ Katie rolled her eyes and pointed at the door. “Out!” Juan hesitated. “Seriously, maybe with a little lipstick-” “Out!” Katie pushed him out the door. Juan turned and tried one last time. “Maybe a wig-” Katie rolled her eyes, then shut the door. After packing up her meager belongings, she carried her bag to the hotel and entered the brightly-lit interior. The lobby was now pretty much empty except for a few men propping sheets of metal up against the newly walled in windows and doors for added security. Taking the elevator that still reeked of bleach, she was relieved to not have to climb the stairs again today. Her legs were aching horribly. Her new room was nice, spacious, and welcoming. The four poster bed and heavy Victorian furniture were not her cup of tea, but there was something very homey about it all. She pushed back the heavy dark pink curtains covering the tall, narrow windows and looked down into the street. A few figures staggered out there. They were zombies too mutilated to run and pose much of a threat. Closing the curtains, she set about putting away her things. It was sad how quickly everything was tucked away into its proper place. In this new world, she barely owned anything. Maybe that was good, less to be attached to. She turned down the bed and flipped on the TV. It was on a closed circuit. Someone had put in a bunch of movies to run through the night. Terminator 2 was on and she briefly compared her arms to Linda Hamilton’s. All this hard work had her looking pretty buff. With a sigh, she headed into the bathroom for a long bath. She undressed, her body protesting every movement. Looking into the mirror, she saw why. There were bruises all over her body. As she sat in the tub in the hot clear water, she studied each one with disgust. The ones on her arm were the most terrifying, but they were a lesson learned. A zombie could not bite through thick cloth; that was something to keep in mind. Using the hotel’s rose soap, she scrubbed herself clean and was relieved to finally not smell of death and bleach. After her bath, dressed in a tank top and pajama bottom she had claimed from the WalMart shipment down in the city hall basement, she started moving things around the hotel room. The bed was far too heavy to move, but she rearranged the chairs, desk and vanity. Little decorative knickknacks were either tossed or put into a new area of the room. She moved the paintings around and fussed with one of the mirrors until it was set at a good height on the wall. Finally, feeling the room was hers, she sank into a chair and began to read a book she had borrowed from the makeshift library Peggy was keeping in city hall.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fighting-to-survive-as-the-world-dies-2/page-22.html","bookId":2482,"book":{"id":2482,"title":"Fighting to Survive (As the World Dies #2)","description":"Storyline: Fighting to Survive (As the World Dies #2) Katie and Jenni have found new lives with the survivors of their makeshift fort, but danger still lurks.
