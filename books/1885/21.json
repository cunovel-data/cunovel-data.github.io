{"id":84102,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"A few days after my sister\u0027s impromptu marriage, the tour was in Washington, D.C. Kellan and I had spent a good chunk of the morning exploring the city with everyone and were resting up a bit before the show tonight. I could not believe how much heritage was crammed into our nation\u0027s capital. Everywhere we\u0027d turned there had been some amazing historical artifact or monument that I\u0027d just had to see. It was like a School House Rock video come to life. Kellan and I were definitely coming back here when we had more time to explore.\\n\\n While Kellan scribbled down some song lyrics in one of his journals, I typed The End on my story, saved the file, then reached across the table and wrapped my fingers around Kellan\u0027s. A sense of relief and completion filled me as I leaned back in the chair. It felt really good to get all of that out of my head, to finally be done telling my story. Kellan lifted his head as he noticed my expression. \"You\u0027re finished? Do I finally get to read it?\"\\n\\n I hesitated, then turned the laptop so that it faced him. There were parts of this he was not going to like. A lot of parts, actually. But he wanted to know them, and I\u0027d given him my word that I would let him read them. His eyes remained locked on mine as he set aside his pen and paper and slowly sat up straight. He knew the amount of trust I was showing him by letting him read my deepest thoughts.\\n\\n When his eyes went down to the computer screen, a horrible feeling filled my stomach; it was a bad case of nerves mixed with a hefty dose of fear. I suddenly wanted to be anywhere other than the bus. I\u0027d rather be in a press conference admitting to the world that I was Kellan\u0027s girlfriend than be sitting across from Kellan while he read my torturous book.\\n\\n As Kellan worked his way to the beginning of the story, I stood up. His eyes flashed to mine, and I shook out my trembling fingers. \"I can\u0027t just peacefully sit here while you read it.\" I looked around the empty bus, not knowing where to go. Everyone was still gone. Some were at the hotel, some were still exploring the city. My sister had gone shopping with Griffin. She was starting to turn the back of the bus into a nursery, which made me wonder if she really was going to stay on the tour until she delivered.\\n\\n Kellan started to close the laptop. \"If it bothers you, I won\u0027t read it.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, running my fingers through my hair. \"No, I want you to. I just . . . can\u0027t watch you do it.\"\\n\\n As Kellan reopened the computer, I headed toward the cubbies. I could grab his Discman and listen to some classic tunes for a while. There were a few fans hanging around the perimeter of the parking lot. From the corner of my eye, I saw them start to freak out. Cell phone cameras were recording, people were yelling. They reminded me of a pack of jumping, chattering hyenas. I had no idea why they were suddenly riled; things had been pretty quiet here for a while.\\n\\n The bus door was lightly rapped on, and Kellan and I both twisted to look. Who the heck was knocking? Security? Someone from the crew? I was pretty sure all of the guys in the band were still gone. Besides, none of them would\u0027ve knocked; they would just enter if they were back. Well, except Griffin; he was still making an effort to knock whenever Kellan and I were alone together. I couldn\u0027t tell if he was trying to be respectful or trying to be an asshole. Either way was fine with me, so long as he didn\u0027t walk in on us again.\\n\\n While I stayed near the center of the bus, Kellan headed over to the door. I peered out the window to get a better look and rolled my eyes. Sienna. Of course it was Sienna. Who else could get the Kell-Sex fans in a tizzy? I stepped forward as Kellan opened the door. \"Sienna? What are you doing here?\" She didn\u0027t usually bug us on our bus.\\n\\n Sienna gave Kellan an adoring smile. \"Can I come in?\"\\n\\n Kellan stepped back, swishing his arm to indicate that she could. When Sienna walked by him in the doorway, she paused. \"Thank you,\" she murmured, batting her eyelashes.\\n\\n Kellan kept his face neutral as he closed the door on the crowd of prying eyes. The fans shouted out comments and questions the entire time until the door seal drowned them out. How long have you been together? Are you getting married? We love you guys! Kell-Sex forever! Hearing that, I couldn\u0027t contain my eye rolling. How one imaginary relationship had become such a focal point for some people was beyond me.\\n\\n As Sienna entered the lounge area of the bus, she smiled brightly at me, like none of that had just happened. \"Kiera! Lovely to see you.\"\\n\\n \"You too,\" I muttered, not really meaning it.\\n\\n Coming up behind her, Kellan asked, \"What is it?\" He said it slowly, like he was sure she had a hidden motive for being here. I was sure too, but with all those pictures that had just been snapped, I think she\u0027d already accomplished it.\\n\\n Sienna twisted to him, a coy smile on her face. \"Can\u0027t a girl drop in on her friends? I\u0027m used to having people around me, but this tour it\u0027s just been my security and me on the bus. Gets a little lonely.\" Thinking of something, her face lit up. \"Would you two like to ride the next leg of the tour with me?\"\\n\\n Kellan opened his mouth, but I beat him to it. \"No, it\u0027s all right, we\u0027re fine here.\" The tabloids would proclaim Sienna to be pregnant by the next venue if she and Kellan shared a bus.\\n\\n Sienna pouted like she was crestfallen. \"Well, the offer stands if you change your mind.\" Her dark eyes flicked around our home-away-from-home. \"My bus really is much nicer than this one.\"\\n\\n Walking past her, Kellan scooped my laptop off of the table, then twisted to Sienna. \"I was actually going to rest a little bit before the show. Hope you don\u0027t mind.\" Sienna shrugged as she shook her head. Kellan turned to me. \"You okay?\" He discreetly indicated Sienna, and I knew what he meant-Are you okay being alone with her?\\n\\n I nodded. Feeling those butterflies return, I touched the laptop with my finger. \"I\u0027m more worried about you reading this.\"\\n\\n Kellan kissed my cheek, then breathed in my ear, \"It won\u0027t change how I feel about you.\" His breath on my skin raised the hairs on my neck.\\n\\n As Kellan started walking toward the back, I turned to face Sienna. She was watching him leave with a small smile on her lips. \"Kind of weird, wasn\u0027t it?\" I asked her.\\n\\n She tore her gaze away from Kellan\u0027s backside to look at me. \"What, love?\"\\n\\n I smiled at her as genuinely as I could, but it felt fake to me. \"All those photographers waiting at the club when we arrived?\"\\n\\n Sienna\u0027s perfectly painted lips curved into a smirk. \"Not really. My location seems to be leaked on a daily basis. I can barely use the bathroom without a witness.\" She indicated the empty bus with her hand. \"It makes me a little jealous to watch how easily the group of you can come and go. I mean, your sister is shopping at a mall right now, isn\u0027t she?\" I nodded, and Sienna sighed. \"I can\u0027t even step inside a mall without being mobbed.\"\\n\\n As I considered what her life was like, what Kellan\u0027s life was quickly becoming, I told her, \"You could give it all up, move somewhere remote?\"\\n\\n Sienna laughed as she twirled a dark lock around her finger. \"Give up the stage? Sure, I could, but what\u0027s the point of life if you\u0027re not doing what makes you the happiest? And even though it has its setbacks, the perks far outweigh them. I\u0027m on top of the world right now, and I wouldn\u0027t change that for anything. I like where I am.\"\\n\\n Her eyes drifted back to where Kellan was hiding away and I thought there was one thing Sienna would change if she could-Kellan would be right beside her on her throne as she ruled the world.\\n\\n Sienna stayed and visited with me for about an hour. She glanced back at the cubbies a handful of times, but Kellan never reemerged. Perhaps bored, perhaps disappointed, Sienna frowned and said, \"See you at the show,\" loud enough for Kellan to hear. If he did, he didn\u0027t respond. Slapping on a flawless smile, Sienna proudly left the bus.\\n\\n After Sienna left, curiosity got the better of me and I went to go check on Kellan. He had closed the curtain to the sleeping area behind him when he\u0027d gone in there. I tentatively pulled it aside and stuck my head in. The light was on in our cubby, and the privacy curtain was open. Kellan was on his side, staring at the laptop. His expression was intense, absorbed.\\n\\n Quietly walking toward him, I murmured, \"Sienna left.\"\\n\\n He started and peeked up at me. \"I didn\u0027t hear you come in. You scared the piss out of me.\"\\n\\n I smiled at his comment and sat on the edge of our bed. Chewing my lip, I pointed at the computer. \"Do you hate me?\" I whispered.\\n\\n Kellan stared at me a long, silent moment. His face was still blank. Aside from that brief moment of surprise, I had no idea what he thought. Had he read about my feelings for Denny? God, had he read our sex scenes? I shouldn\u0027t have let him read the full manuscript. I should have edited. How did he feel about it? Not knowing anything that was going on in his head was killing me, but I waited for him to be ready to speak. When he sighed and closed the computer screen, I braced myself for the worst.\\n\\n Climbing out of the hole we slept in, he moved to sit beside me on the edge of the mattress. Our heads rested against the bunk above us. Face softening into sadness, he finally whispered, \"I\u0027m so sorry . . . for all the pain I put you through.\"\\n\\n My eyes watered. \"For all the pain you put me through? I\u0027m the one that cut out your heart, then handed it back to you in pieces.\"\\n\\n Kellan smirked. \"I haven\u0027t gotten that far in the story yet. I\u0027m still at the part where I\u0027m an asshole.\"\\n\\n Smiling, I bumped his shoulder with mine. \"I kind of like it when you\u0027re an asshole.\"\\n\\n Kellan smiled at the ground. \"I\u0027ll keep that in mind.\" He looked up at me again. \"But I mean it. I really am sorry. I should have just been honest with you. I wanted to tell you how I felt . . . I just . . . couldn\u0027t. It was too hard.\"\\n\\n Swallowing, I nodded. \"I know. But you don\u0027t have to apologize. What I did to you was so much worse. Sorry isn\u0027t a big enough word to cover it.\" Kellan didn\u0027t argue with me. He just gave me a sad smile and wiped a tear off of my cheek with his fingers. Needing to say it now, while we were knee-deep in regrets, I added, \"I\u0027m so sorry about the scenes with Denny. I shouldn\u0027t have let you read those.\"\\n\\n Knowing which scenes I was referring to, Kellan put his finger over my lips. \"Don\u0027t. I understand. I knew going into this that a story about us was also going to be a story about the two of you. And it should be. He was a big part of your life, and I\u0027m okay with your history. It made you who you are. And I happen to be in love with who you are.\" I gaped at him, amazed at the depth of his empathy. He laughed a little. \"I couldn\u0027t read about it, though. I, uh, skimmed a few parts. I hope you don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n Shaking my head, I threw my arms around him. No, of course I didn\u0027t mind. Clutching his shirt in my hands, I buried my head in his neck. God, he was amazing. Holding him tight, I released a few final tears of guilt and remorse. Once the feeling was gone, I kissed his neck. \"I love you, you know?\"\\n\\n Holding me tight to him, rubbing my back, Kellan murmured, \"I know you love my hair.\" I pulled back to look at his amused face; he could barely contain his smile. \"I mean you really love my hair . . . almost obsessively so. I had no idea.\" His grin turned bright and boyish. \"And my abs.\" He cocked an eyebrow at me. \"Would you like to try etching them with a marker? I\u0027ll let you. Although, edible paint is a lot more fun.\"\\n\\n Pushing his chest away from me, I stood up. Jackass. Laughing, Kellan grabbed my hips and pulled me onto his lap. I giggled as I crashed into his arms. Tangling my fingers into his remarkable hair, I husked out, \"I\u0027ll etch you if you etch me.\"\\n\\n Kellan twisted me around so I was straddling him. His eyes were bright with excitement as he brought his lips toward mine. \"Deal,\" he mumbled before our mouths touched. Then his fingers darted under my shirt, like he was going to start the art project right now.\\n\\n His fingers danced along my skin, tickling me as much as caressing me. I was laughing in between our playful kisses and wishing that we could somehow sneak off of this bus and escape into a private hotel room.\\n\\n \"Well, this is familiar,\" said a voice from behind me.\\n\\n I broke apart from Kellan\u0027s lips to glance at the now-open bus curtain. Being walked in on didn\u0027t startle me as much as it used to, but it still wasn\u0027t something I enjoyed. When I saw who was here, shock washed through me. \"Jenny?\"\\n\\n My blond best friend giggled as she bounced on her toes. \"Surprise!\"\\n\\n I squealed in Kellan\u0027s ear and shot up off of his lap. I collided with Jenny and held her tight as new tears stung my eyes. It had only been a couple of months, but it felt like forever since I\u0027d last seen her. After our exuberant greeting, I noticed who was behind her. \"Kate? Rachel? Cheyenne?\"\\n\\n Seeing all of my favorite people from Seattle here in D.C. was beyond odd. They seemed stranger to me than all the hoopla surrounding Kellan and another woman. Jenny laughed at the look on my face as I twisted between my girlfriends and Kellan; a small, knowing smile was plastered on Kellan\u0027s face, so I figured he knew what was up. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n Griffin and Anna were back from their shopping excursion. Anna was standing behind Cheyenne, her expression joyful. Griffin was loaded down with shopping bags and dramatically collapsed into a chair; a sea of colorful bags fell around him, and a couple of blue onesies fell to the floor.\\n\\n Looping her arm around Rachel, Anna handed me the only thing that she was carrying-a completely black plastic bag. A little nervous, I gingerly removed it from her hand and peeked inside. There were a plethora of things in the bag, but a giant penis staring me in the face was the thing that really got my attention. Cinching the bag closed, my eyes snapped to Kellan\u0027s. \"Okay, seriously, what the hell is going on?\"\\n\\n Kellan laughed as he stood and put an arm around me. \"We\u0027re officially getting married next month, and Anna and Griffin just tied the knot, so we\"-he pointed at Anna and himself-\"decided a little celebration was in order.\"\\n\\n Anna held her belly while she bounced on her toes. \"Dual bachelorette party, Kiera!\"\\n\\n I looked over all of my friends, shocked. They had all flown across the country with hardly any notice to help Anna and I celebrate our weddings? And, I suppose, in Jenny and Rachel\u0027s case, to visit with their boyfriends.\\n\\n After hugging each friend in turn, I looked back at Kellan. \"You arranged all of this?\"\\n\\n He smiled and shrugged. \"Our lives are crazy. When moments to remember happen, you have to pause a second to appreciate them. Otherwise none of this\"-he indicted the bus-\"is worth it. And getting married to you is definitely a moment to remember.\"\\n\\n I heard a dreamy sigh escape Kate\u0027s lips as my eyes misted. Griffin intruded on my romantic moment by doing what he did best. He opened his mouth. \"And while you guys are drooling over dudes, we\u0027ll be swimming in a sea of half-naked babes.\"\\n\\n Anna elbowed him in the stomach, but she laughed. I looked back at Kellan. He shook his head. \"We\u0027re just going to a bar after the show tonight.\"\\n\\n Griffin pouted. \"I said I wanted a strip club.\"\\n\\n Kellan gave him a flat look. \"And I said I wanted a bar. If you want to do separate bachelor parties, then by all means, go to a strip club tonight. But I don\u0027t feel like celebrating my marriage with overpriced alcohol and glitter.\"\\n\\n Griffin rolled his eyes and made a sound like a whip being cracked. Kellan only smiled at him. I faced my sister. \"And what exactly are we doing tonight?\"\\n\\n Anna gave me a wide smile. \"Oh, don\u0027t you worry about the details. I\u0027ve got everything under control.\"\\n\\n Hours later, I was staring at myself in the mirror contemplating whether I should kiss my sister or deck her. Her master plan to celebrate our nuptials was to dress all of us girls in matching outfits that were half Robert Palmer video chick and half Muppet. We were all wearing skintight, short, long-sleeved dresses. Jenny and Anna had done everyone\u0027s makeup-bright red lipstick and smoky eyes-and Cheyenne and Kate had pulled everyone\u0027s hair back into long, sleek ponytails. I thought we were going to leave the dressing up at resembling \"Addicted to Love\" fill-ins, but I should have known that wasn\u0027t flashy enough for my sister. Once we were all uniformly dressed, she\u0027d pulled out the coup de grace-an assortment of neon colored wigs.\\n\\n As I fingered the bright pink hair in my reflection, Anna joined me. Giggling at her own mass of electric blue hair, she exclaimed, \"We look fucking hot!\"\\n\\n Turning around, I examined my sister\u0027s outfit. Even with a belly large enough to house two small children, she looked good. I had no doubts she would be hit on at some point. \"I feel ridiculous, Anna.\"\\n\\n Making a dismissive noise, Anna smoothed my short, pink bob. \"Well, you look amazing.\"\\n\\n \"Do I really have to wear this?\" I pointed down the bus, to where Kellan and the guys were waiting to see us before heading out for their show. \"Kellan got a say in his night. Don\u0027t I get a say in mine?\"\\n\\n Smiling, Anna shook her head, a neon strand of blue hair stuck to her lip. \"No.\" When I grimaced, Anna turned me back around to face the bathroom mirror. \"Tonight, you are not Kiera.\" She leaned in so that our faces were side-by-side, and for the first time, I noticed something I really never had before-my sister and I looked a lot alike. \"Tonight, you are Kiki, sex goddess!\"\\n\\n I groaned, but then immediately laughed. Sure, why not. I needed a short break from my life anyway. \"Okay, Anna, you win.\"\\n\\n She smacked my butt as she walked away. \"Don\u0027t I always, Kiera?\" She smirked at me over her shoulder. \"I mean Kiki.\"\\n\\n Feeling like we were about to film a live-action version of Fraggle Rock, the girls and I stepped into the main portion of the bus. Griffin let out an earsplitting catcall. Matt\u0027s face flushed with color, while Evan\u0027s broke into a wide grin. And Kellan, well, let\u0027s just say I was getting thoroughly examined, and he appeared to like what he saw.\\n\\n A lime-green-haired Jenny collapsed into Evan\u0027s arms, marking his cheek with a bright red lipstick outline. Rachel, wearing a canary-yellow wig, put her hands over her face and giggled uncontrollably as Matt held her; at least one of the girls was as embarrassed as I was. Kate smoothed her deep purple wig with a bright smile on her face. And Cheyenne, her hair a flaming red color that reminded me of Meadow\u0027s, clapped me on the shoulder as Kellan stood to greet me.\\n\\n Lip curved in a seductive half-smile, he growled, \"I am not going to be able to concentrate on stage tonight with this image of you in my mind.\" His smile widening, he added, \"You are unbelievably hot.\"\\n\\n Resisting the urge to deny his compliment, I instead told him, \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n Kellan\u0027s face was full of pride at my growing level of confidence. As my girlfriends said their goodbyes and grabbed their stuff, Kellan leaned in close. In my ear, he murmured, \"You\u0027re keeping the wig, right?\"\\n\\n His fingers slid through a pink lock as he sucked on his bottom lip. Heat, fire, and passion were burning in his eyes, and I suddenly didn\u0027t want to go anywhere but to a private hotel room with him. My lips against his ear, I told him, \"It\u0027s the only thing I\u0027ll keep on when I get back.\"\\n\\n Kellan made a strangled groaning noise, then slung his arms around my waist. Over his shoulder, he told the guys, \"Change of plans, we\u0027re canceling the show tonight and staying in.\"\\n\\n Matt glowered for a fraction of a second, then looked over at Rachel grabbing her purse and smiled. Evan shouted his agreement and pulled Jenny back into his lap. Griffin exclaimed, \"Fuck yeah,\" and pinched Anna\u0027s ass.\\n\\n I smiled back at Kellan. \"Nice try, but you know you can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n He gave me a forlorn sigh. \"I know, but it was a nice thought.\"\\n\\n I gave him a soft peck, then slid away from him and collected my girls. Anna started doling out the rest of our outfits, and I contained a groan. It was the penis-paraphernalia that I\u0027d noticed earlier. She gave each girl an obscene necklace, straw, suckers, and feather boas that matched our wig colors. The boas had shiny, tinsel penises woven into them. We were all dressed like sex-starved maniacs. I think my cheeks matched Cheyenne\u0027s hair.\\n\\n As we gathered around the front of the bus, I saw a modestly sized black limo arriving at the edge of the lot. Kellan and the boys brushed past us. \"We\u0027re going to head in now,\" he said as he kissed my cheek. Seeing me staring at the fancy car, he added, \"I rented you a limo for the evening, so you could relax. Have fun tonight. You deserve it.\"\\n\\n He winked at me and I smiled at his thoughtfulness. \"Thank you. You guys have fun too.\" As he walked away from me, I grabbed his arm. \"Hey, if you really want to go to a strip club, I would be okay with it. I trust you.\" I swallowed, not thrilled about the idea, but comfortable enough to know that Kellan wouldn\u0027t do anything differently behind my back than he would do if I were right beside him.\\n\\n Kellan smiled. \"I\u0027m glad to hear that. I don\u0027t need a club, though.\" He shrugged. \"They never really did anything for me anyway.\" I gave him a sly grin. That was probably true. Kellan didn\u0027t need to pay for beautiful, naked women to hang all over him. If he wanted, he could have that in a heartbeat just by throwing a party at his house.\\n\\n There was a burst of noise and camera flashes as Kellan left the bus; some of the fans were still waiting around, then. Well, tonight was their lucky night. Not only were they getting an up close view of rock stars, but they were about to get an eyeful of rather bizarrely dressed women. Damn my free-spirited sister.\\n\\n The girls and I waited a few more minutes, then dashed to our car. I stayed in the middle of the group, head down and neon pink hair blocking my face. The driver held the door open for us as we approached. Anna exchanged a few words with him before joining Jenny, Rachel, Kate, Cheyenne and I in the spacious vehicle. Remembering the spectacle at the club, Poison, I kept my eyes open for anyone following us. I know I would be curious about a group of women dressed like colorful hookers exiting a rock star\u0027s tour bus and hopping into a limousine.\\n\\n Anna elbowed me in the ribs. \"Relax, Kiki, you\u0027re free.\"\\n\\n Laughing at my paranoia, I shifted to the front. \"Yes, I am. Let\u0027s go have some fun.\"\\n\\n The girls laughed with me while the driver gave us amused, puzzled glances. Per my sister\u0027s instructions, he drove us to a restaurant. Even though I felt like an idiot as the group of us slid out of the car and walked into Red Robin-my sister was having a craving for seasoned fries-I was grateful that we were eating first. I was starving.\\n\\n Funnily enough, with the chaotic ambiance of the restaurant, we fit right in, like a piece of living art. Every patron in the place turned their heads to stare at us, though. Pushing aside the feeling of everyone\u0027s eyes on me, I followed my sister up the stairs to the bar. The six of us scooted into a booth, with Jenny, Kate, and Rachel on one side, Cheyenne, Anna, and I on the other. The fresh-faced waiter who arrived seconds later was clearly impressed with our outfits. \"Hi, I\u0027m Gabe. I\u0027ll be your server this evening.\" Pointing his pen at our penis-inlaid boas, he smirked, \"Bachelorette party?\"\\n\\n Pulling the boa off, I placed it on the seat beside me. Flaunting phallic shapes at a family restaurant probably wasn\u0027t the best idea, young eyes and all. On the limo ride over, I\u0027d made my sister put her penis necklace in her purse and promise me that she wouldn\u0027t use her straw or sucker here. She\u0027d grudgingly agreed.\\n\\n Tossing her arm around me, Anna beamed at Gabe. \"Yep, my girl\u0027s tying the knot, so we need to get her lit!\"\\n\\n Gabe turned his blue eyes to me. \"Congratulations.\"\\n\\n Surprisingly, his gaze shifted over my face. Wow, was he checking me out? \"Thanks,\" I murmured. \"We\u0027re celebrating her recent wedding too.\" I turned to Anna. \"I still can\u0027t believe you married Griffin.\"\\n\\n Anna rolled her eyes. \"Let it go. You\u0027re worse than Dad.\" I had to laugh at that comment. It was highly unlikely that Dad knew about Anna\u0027s marital status. I doubt she\u0027d even told him that she\u0027d left Seattle yet.\\n\\n Gabe\u0027s smile widened. \"Sisters?\" Leaning toward us, he gave everyone a grin, then focused solely on me. \"I know just what you guys need. Mind if I pick your drinks?\" He winked at me as he straightened, and my mind froze. He really was hitting on me.\\n\\n \"Uh, no, go right ahead.\" Not knowing what else to do, I gave him a polite smile.\\n\\n Leaning around me, Anna told him, \"It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve been one, but make mine a virgin, \u0027kay?\" She rubbed her expanded belly and Gabe pulled his eyes from me to glance at her.\\n\\n He nodded, his eyes instantly returning to mine. \"Will do.\" He stood back up and pointed his pen at us again. \"You ladies don\u0027t go anywhere. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n After he walked away, all of the girls looked at me simultaneously. \"He was so checking you out!\" Jenny exclaimed.\\n\\n I sank into my chair and fingered my bright hair. \"No, he wasn\u0027t.\" I giggled at the end of my sentence. Yeah, he was. Well, unfortunately for Gabe, I wasn\u0027t single. No, I was about to formally marry my rock-star sweetheart, whose searing good looks were insignificant in comparison to the beauty inside his soul. He was as close to perfect as one human being could be, and he was mine. I was beyond blessed.\\n\\n Gabe returned a few minutes later with huge, crazy-shaped glasses full of something fruity and strong; I cringed a little after taking my first sip. Gabe winked at me again. \"That should properly prep you for your evening.\"\\n\\n I thanked him, then ordered some chicken strips. I was going to need a good base in my stomach if this drink was any indication of how the night was going to turn out. Gabe flirted with me throughout the remainder of our meal. Needless to say, I received the most attentive service that I\u0027d ever received at a restaurant. The girls teased me about it relentlessly. Gabe was cute, so I was flattered, but Kellan had my heart and I wasn\u0027t interested. When Gabe handed me the receipt when we were finished, his number was on it. My eyes were wide as I looked up at him. He shrugged. \"Just in case it doesn\u0027t work out.\"\\n\\n I was so surprised that he\u0027d done that, my only response was, \"Thanks.\" Collecting myself, I added, \"I think it\u0027s going to work out, though.\"\\n\\n Gabe looked disheartened as I stood to leave him. I was so used to seeing that expression of disappointment on female faces as Kellan walked away that it was bizarre to see it directed at me. A thought struck me as I showed the receipt to my sister outside. If we\u0027d been playing the game Kellan and the boys played when they went out, I would have won tonight. Just the thought made me giggle while the rest of the girls let out loud hoots and hollers.\\n\\n Wondering what he would say, I snapped a picture of the receipt and texted it to Kellan with the message I won! I hoped he would find that funny, and not worry about what I was doing. But if I was willing to trust him with strippers, than he\u0027d have to trust me too. And he did.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t text me back, but I didn\u0027t expect him to. He was in the middle of a show, probably just about done with his set. It was strange not to be there, listening to him play, but I was enjoying my girl time. I wasn\u0027t sure where we were headed next, but I was slightly buzzed from Gabe\u0027s drink, so I didn\u0027t much care. Anna gave our limo driver a swift kiss on the cheek, making the older man blush. Feeling benevolent, I kissed him on the opposite cheek.\\n\\n Where we ended up going was a strip club. I frowned as the car pulled up to the bright pink neon flashing a pair of female legs so that it looked like they were kicking. I cringed at the name of the club-Pole Palace. Glancing over to Anna, I firmly told her, \"I have no interest in watching a bunch of half-naked women flirt with married men.\"\\n\\n Anna let out an exasperated sigh. \"Where\u0027s your sense of adventure, Kiki?\" With a sly smile she added, \"You will like this, trust me.\"\\n\\n Not sure if I should trust my up-for-anything sister, I hesitantly stepped out of the limo. At the last minute, I told the driver, \"If you see me running from the building in terror, please take me home right away.\"\\n\\n The driver smiled at me as he held the door open. \"Absolutely . . . Kiki.\"\\n\\n Once again dressed in our penis gear, the group of us gathered under the front awning. Jenny and Kate seemed fine with going somewhere else or going inside; Rachel seemed just as dubious about this place as I was. Cheyenne was smiling. When I glanced at the front door of Pole Palace, I noticed the huge sign propped on an easel beside it and shook my head. Ladies Night! Come on in to see the hottest men in town! I should have known.\\n\\n For some reason, it did make me feel a little better to know that we were going to be watching half-naked men flirt with married women. It seemed more innocent. I still felt horribly embarrassed about the whole thing, though, especially since I was dressed like a Bratz doll. \"Anna, are you serious?\"\\n\\n With an ear-to-ear grin, she turned toward the bouncer. \"Yep.\"\\n\\n Jenny, Kate, and Cheyenne giggled and followed after her. Rachel and I looked at each other, shared a moment of mortification, then sucked up our inhibitions and followed after our more gregarious friends. The place was jam-packed with women of all ages. They were hooting, hollering, and shouting at the greased-up studs on the stage. The men dancing were gyrating and hip thrusting in a suggestive way that made me a little uncomfortable.\\n\\n Wondering if Kellan would be okay with me being here since we hadn\u0027t talked about me going to a strip club, I grabbed Anna\u0027s arm. \"Do you think Kellan . . . and the boys . . . will be okay with this?\" I indicated some shirtless male servers posing for pictures with some very friendly female patrons.\\n\\n Anna quirked a smile. \"I think they\u0027ll be fine with it.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t quite sure, and I felt a little guilty about being here. I didn\u0027t plan on doing anything with any of these beefy, well-cut guys, but Kellan didn\u0027t know I was here, and it felt dishonest that he didn\u0027t know. I pulled out my phone to call him, and Anna snatched it away from me. \"He won\u0027t mind, Kiera, and I told him where we were going. He was cool with it.\" She indicated the stage. \"He\u0027s the one that found a place with male dancers tonight.\"\\n\\n Surprise washed through me, but only for a moment. Of course he\u0027d arranged this. Kellan wanted me to have a good time with my friends, and by the looks of the tittering women around us, being here was a very good time. Kellan also loved embarrassing me, and when a man wearing pants so tight they left nothing to the imagination asked me if I wanted a drink, I was very embarrassed.\\n\\n Laughing, I finally accepted that being here was okay and relaxed with my friends. Anna sat us at a table near the front of the stage, and a couple of drinks into it I was hollering along with the rest of the girls in the audience. The dances were amusing, and yes, sexy as hell. My favorite part about it was the costumes. We\u0027d had a fireman, policeman, and a construction worker so far. It was beyond ridiculous, and I couldn\u0027t stop laughing. Then a man dressed like a cowboy stepped out onto the stage.\\n\\n He was wearing a bandanna around his mouth like he was a bandit and a black cowboy hat pulled low over his eyes. One of his hands was holding the tip of his hat, the other rested by his side. He was wearing a vest with nothing on underneath it, and his muscles had a light sheen to them, like he was slathered in oil. Like any good cowboy, he was wearing chaps . . . over a pair of dark spandex briefs. He was hot, and a hush went over the crowd. Just the way he stood there while he waited for the music to start was seductive, and I had a feeling he\u0027d be good at riling up the crowd.\\n\\n A heavy beat filled the air. I recognized the song as one of Rhianna\u0027s provocative hits. When the beat started, the cowboy lifted his eyes and stared at the crowd. I sputtered on the drink coming up my penis straw. \"Oh my fucking God!\" I screeched that, and Jenny, Kate, Cheyenne, and Rachel all twisted to stare at me like I was insane. Anna was holding her sides, laughing.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t even answer my friends\u0027 questioning looks, because I recognized the pair of seductive dark blue eyes sweeping the crowd. As his hips started swaying and the crowd started yelling, those familiar bedroom eyes locked right onto me. I couldn\u0027t see his mouth, but I knew he was smiling at me. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die, but I couldn\u0027t stop watching him. What the hell was Kellan doing here, in a strip club, dancing?\\n\\n As he really started getting into his act, I stopped caring. Kellan was a natural seducer and was intoxicating to watch as he moved across the stage-a stage he owned just as much as when he was singing. Sliding and shaking, he worked his way back and forth across the front. When he stopped at our table, he slowly and seductively removed his vest. My heart was going a million miles an hour. When he tossed the fabric at me, I almost didn\u0027t have the reflexes to catch it. With his perfect chest on display, the crowd went nuts. With his tattoo of my name across his heart on display, my friends turned back to me, wide-eyed; they knew about Kellan\u0027s tattoo. Astonished, Jenny asked, \"Is that . . . ?\"\\n\\n Fearing being overheard, she didn\u0027t say his name out loud. She didn\u0027t have to either. We all knew who she was referencing. As I weakly nodded that, yes, it was Kellan up there shaking his booty, they all started laughing. Anna let out an earsplitting whistle. Yes, my husband was stripping.\\n\\n Just like when the D-Bags played, Kellan worked the crowd. He let the girls touch him, but backed off when they got too close or too friendly. He ran his hands over his own slick skin, caressing himself in ways that I was sure most of the audience was fantasizing about touching him. Halfway through the song, he ripped off his chaps to thunderous applause. I buried my face in my hands, mortified and turned on. I could not believe he was doing this, and at the same time, I wasn\u0027t surprised; it was exactly something Kellan would do.\\n\\n Toward the end of the long song, Kellan sauntered my way. He was now only dressed in cowboy boots, tight spandex shorts, his face-concealing bandanna mask, and his cowboy hat. Holding my breath, I hoped he got to keep the outfit. Kellan jumped off the stage to land right beside our table. Women leapt at the chance to touch him, but he grabbed me and pulled me to my feet. As nearby patrons cursed in jealousy and hollered in approval, Kellan finished his tantalizing dance by grabbing my leg and hooking it around his hip. I instinctively conformed to his body, and for a moment forgot that we were the center of attention. Kellan dipped me when the song was finally over. When he pulled me up, our faces were inches apart. I could see his fast breath under his mask; it matched mine. Not caring who was watching, I kissed him through the fabric. His eyes fluttered closed as his hands traveled over my ass. The crowd erupted into shrieks.\\n\\n Remembering that we were being watched, I reluctantly pulled away from him. Laughing, Kellan told me, \"You probably shouldn\u0027t turn me on in this outfit. I may get arrested.\"\\n\\n Laughing, I pushed his slick chest away from me. \"I cannot believe you just did that.\"\\n\\n Bending over he kissed my hand. \"I couldn\u0027t resist.\" He pointed over to Anna. \"It was her idea.\"\\n\\n I glared at my sister, and she flashed her hands up and down his body. \"Sex on a Stick,\" was all she said.\\n\\n As the MC announcing all of the dancers started in on the next act-a soldier in a crisp, white uniform-Kellan gave me a final hug. \"I have to go finish my other performance or Matt will have my head.\" Looking down at himself, he added, \"And I need to go wipe this oil shit off.\"\\n\\n I laughed and kissed his cheek. \"You\u0027re something else, you know?\"\\n\\n He tilted his head at me. \"So are you. It\u0027s good to see you having fun. I\u0027ll see you back at the hotel.\"\\n\\n Raising an eyebrow, I mimicked his seductive tone, \"Yes, you certainly will.\"\\n\\n Kellan\u0027s eyes crinkled at the corners and I knew he was flashing me a grin that would have these women weak in the knees. I wanted to pull off his mask so I could see it, but I didn\u0027t want anyone here recognizing him. Kellan dressed as a half-naked cowboy was definitely an image I didn\u0027t want to get out to the Kell-Sex fans; this was mine and mine alone-well, mine and a barful of unsuspecting women.\\n\\n We pulled apart, and Kellan made his way back to the stage so he could change and return to his concert. Along the way he was stroked and pawed by several feminine hands. He waded his way through them, stopping a couple that were drifting to the low side of his body. He looked back at me after he climbed the steps on the edge of the stage and tipped his cowboy hat. I smiled, sighed, and felt myself falling even deeper in love with him.\\n\\n The rest of the acts paled in comparison to Kellan, and I found myself daydreaming about him more than watching them. Seeing that Anna was quickly petering out, I suggested that we call it a night. Everyone agreed, and we made our way back to our awaiting limousine. I thanked the driver as he opened the door for us.\\n\\n Amusement on his face, he asked, \"How was it?\"\\n\\n \"Wonderful,\" I sighed.\\n\\n He shook his head at me, and I giggled. Anna handed me back my phone as she sleepily rested her head on my shoulder. Patting her electric blue hair, I checked my messages. There was only one, and it was from Kellan. In response to my photograph of Gabe\u0027s phone number, he\u0027d texted, No, I get you tonight and every night, so I\u0027m pretty sure I won.\\n\\n Biting my lip, I asked our driver to hurry to our hotel. I\u0027d probably have to wait for Kellan to get back from his boys\u0027 night out after the concert, but I didn\u0027t mind. My pink wig and I would happily wait all night for him . . . and hopefully he\u0027d come back with his cowboy boots and hat to go with the vest safely tucked in my purse. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reckless-thoughtless-3/page-21.html","bookId":1885,"book":{"id":1885,"title":"Reckless (Thoughtless #3)","description":"Storyline: Reckless (Thoughtless #3) \\n When the band hits it big, Kiera and Kellan must ask themselves: Can their love for each other survive the constant pressures of superstardom?
