{"id":84098,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I had no idea how long I\u0027d been on the road at this point, but I was getting used to the constant traveling. Sleeping had been difficult at first; the motion of the bus kept waking me up, especially when it turned or slowed down. But now I barely noticed it. The bus could probably slam to a stop, dumping me to the floor, and I wouldn\u0027t wake up. Well, okay, that might wake me up. As was typical most times I opened my eyes, the bus was moving. It took a while to tear down Sienna\u0027s shows-they were much more theatrical than Justin\u0027s small tour had been-so the busses usually started their journey to the next venue late at night or early in the morning. Some of the stars and members of the crew utilized the hotel rooms provided to sleep for a few hours, but Kellan and I liked our private room on the bus, so we stayed if we could. As I looked over at the world rushing past the wide window on the far side of the bus, I noticed that it was early in the morning; a rosy glow was still in the sky. Kellan\u0027s toy muscle car that I\u0027d given him last Christmas was perched on the ledge, gently rolling back and forth with the rocking movement of the bus. As was also typical first thing in the morning, I was alone in our bed. Kellan was on the floor of the bus, doing pushups. It was something he routinely did when he first woke up-push-ups and sit-ups. He said it was to keep his body conditioned, but I think it helped clear his mind too; Kellan didn\u0027t always sleep well. I was usually asleep while he was exercising, but occasionally I\u0027d hear him, wake up, and secretly watch him while I dozed on and off. I usually had some pretty fantastic dreams in that half-awake state. Peeking over the edge of the bed, my smile was unstoppable as I mentally traced the lines of his bare back. Kellan\u0027s arms were shaking as he fluidly moved up and down. I wondered how long he\u0027d been working out while I slept. He really pushed himself sometimes, almost like he was punishing himself. I hoped his fervor this morning had nothing to do with Sienna. She hadn\u0027t kissed him again on stage, but the fan photos of that moment were everywhere. True love sealed in a kiss, was the tagline often used with it. The gossip magazines were having a field day with Kellan and Sienna now touring together. I\u0027d seen more stories about how they \"couldn\u0027t stay away from each other\" than I cared to count. Headlines like, \"Kellan Kyle Ditches Tour with Avoiding Redemption to Rush to His Lover\u0027s Side\" were all too common. Everyone was enamored with the fact that, regardless of his abject denial of their relationship, Kellan seemingly couldn\u0027t stay away from Sienna. Wondering if Kellan was all right this morning, I whispered, \"You okay?\" He paused an inch from the floor and looked up at me. Then his arms gave out and he crashed to the ground. Laughing a little, he mumbled, \"Yeah, I\u0027m good.\" Standing up, he swung out his arms; his muscles flexed and released as he stretched them out. \"I just missed feeling sore, so I was doing a few extra today. I didn\u0027t mean to wake you up.\" My eyes drifted down to his signature black boxers. \"You didn\u0027t. I was ready to get up.\" Lifting up the covers, Kellan crawled back into bed with me. His skin was warm from working out; slightly moist, but not yet tacky. I cringed back from him anyway. \"You\u0027re sweaty.\" Laughing, he clamped his legs around mine. \"Well, we\u0027ll just have to make you sweaty too, so it doesn\u0027t bother you.\" I laced my arms around his neck and pulled him into me; it suddenly didn\u0027t bother me anymore. As his lips lowered to my neck, I looked out the closest window. We were speeding down an urban freeway in an early morning commute. A car was right beside us, and the driver was singing along to something like he was the lead singer of a rock band. I froze as I wondered again about the glass. It had a dark tint to it, but could that guy see me? Kellan didn\u0027t notice I was distracted and started moving his lips down my neck. His fingers started bunching up my shirt in preparation to remove it. I groaned and half-closed my eyes, but somehow managed to stop Kellan\u0027s fingers. Intense bedroom eyes peeked up at me, and I swallowed as I nodded toward the glass. \"Kellan, can they see us?\" Kellan glanced over at the car, not looking like he cared if the guy could or not. \"No,\" he quickly answered, bringing his lips back to mine. Believing him, I let myself relax into his arms. There was something incredibly erotic about making love in a place that had the illusion of being very public. As cars buzzed around three sides of us-each one of them with a stunning view, if only they knew-my body heated to a boiling point. Breath intense, I helped Kellan strip off all of my clothes. When I was bare beneath him, his warm palm molded to my breast, gently squeezing. Wanting to return the favor, I slipped my hand down the front of his shorts. He was fully ready for me. As I moved my hand along him, Kellan stopped kissing me. His breath started speeding up as he closed his eyes. He was gorgeous to watch, and I ramped up my efforts. He dropped his head to my shoulder, slumping his chest against mine. \"God, I love it when you touch me,\" he groaned in my ear. His words sent an ache straight to my core, and I suddenly wanted to do a lot more than touch him. I wanted to reduce him to a pile of incoherent rubble again. I wanted to make him cry out so loud, that surely someone in a car zipping past us would hear him. Knowing that I could do all of those things made me feel both beautiful and seductive, and made me love being with him even more. Kellan didn\u0027t give me a chance, though. Before I could make my move on him, he pulled his body out of my reach and started working his way down my skin. His fingers slid between my legs right as his mouth closed over my breast. Clutching my pillow, I cried out like I\u0027d wanted him to. As his fingers stoked the fire raging within me, I arched my back and glanced at the car behind us; the driver following the bus looked so bored. I moaned and closed my eyes. If they only knew. Kellan\u0027s lips quickly trailed over my stomach, leaving tingling goose bumps in their wake. When he neared my waist, I started mumbling his name. I was gripping the pillow in my hands so hard, I was sure it would tear any minute. Kellan reached where I needed him, but he didn\u0027t do anything. I felt like I was going to die while I waited. He stilled my squirming hips, then he lightly blew on me. I gasped, and commanded myself to not climax. It took a lot of willpower. I thought I heard him laugh, but his tongue was on me then, so I didn\u0027t much care if he was amused or not. Reaching down, I tangled my fingers in his hair. As I clenched and unclenched, he alternated patterns up, over, and across my tender flesh. I couldn\u0027t take anymore. As a burst of euphoria flooded through me, I cried out. Kellan gently brought me down, then worked his way back up my body. When I was taffy beneath him, soft, warm, and pliable, and now a little sweaty, he murmured, \"I can never get past H with you.\" I had no idea what he meant, but I was reeling from my explosive release and didn\u0027t really care. \"What?\" I languidly ran my hand up his back as he started grinding his hips against mine. He was turning me up again, and it was working, the fire was rekindling. His lips followed my collarbone. \"The alphabet . . . I can never make it past H before you . . . finish.\" He peeked up at me with hooded eyes. \"What . . . are you talking about?\" I muttered. He ran his nose up my throat, lightly tasting my skin with his tongue. That miraculous tongue worked its way over to my ear, and that\u0027s when I finally caught on to what he was saying. I looked over at his amused face. \"You\u0027re drawing the alphabet while you . . . ?\" He smiled, placing a light kiss on my slightly damp cheek. \"It\u0027s been a goal of mine to make it through the entire alphabet, but I\u0027ve yet to do it.\" His grin turned cocky. \"I\u0027ll keep trying, though.\" Kellan removed his boxers, then ground his hips against me again. The very tip of him moved into me and I gasped and clenched his back. When he pulled away, I groaned; he was killing me. \"Has anyone done it to you?\" I asked, restraining myself from grabbing his hips and forcing him to bury himself inside of me. Kellan paused in kissing my neck. \"The alphabet? No, I don\u0027t think so.\" It was only then that I realized just what I\u0027d asked him. Was that a strange question? Could that be done on a guy? Would he like that? Just the thought of doing that to him made my earlier desire resurface full force. He\u0027d just satisfied me. If I could give him just a fraction of that . . . Before he could say anything else, I pushed him back and started working my way down his chest. His breath hitched as he caught on to what I was planning to do. \"I know it\u0027s not your thing, Kiera. You don\u0027t have to do something you don\u0027t like to please me.\" His eyes met mine as I peeked up at him. \"I like tasting you, that\u0027s why I do it.\" His words made an ache surge through me. Smiling into his belly button, I murmured, \"No, it\u0027s not my favorite thing. But I like the way you react to it.\" I playfully bit into the lean muscle of his lower abdomen, and Kellan\u0027s eyes fluttered closed as he laid his head back on the pillow. \"Uh . . . \u0027kay,\" he mumbled. His hand threaded through my hair as I kissed the tip of him. Not really sure what I was going to do, I gently took him into my mouth. This really wasn\u0027t my favorite thing, but hearing Kellan\u0027s reaction, the deep groan he made as he clenched my hair tight was one of my favorite things, and I focused on that. Working my hand over the long part of him, I alternated bringing him deep into my mouth and letting him go so I could run my tongue over the top of him. I drew a different letter each time I swirled around the tip. Around G I could tell that I was seriously driving him crazy. It drove me crazy too. I lost myself, getting more and more into it. Kellan\u0027s hand wrapped in my hair started shaking, like he was restraining himself from holding me down on him. On the letter L he was squirming around the bed, moaning my name. I nearly lost it, but I kept going with the elaborate tease. When I swirled my tongue around him in a giant O, he sat up and pulled me off of him as he moved to his knees. Before I knew what he was doing, his lips were on mine, hard, needy, and he moved me so I was straddling him. Without a word, he pulled my hips down, sinking me onto him-it stole my breath, it was so intense. We held each other tight as we began to move together in a near frenzy; I\u0027d never seen him so riled up. With cars still zipping past us, oblivious to our passion, I skyrocketed right over the edge. Kellan stiffened a fraction of a second later, plummeting as well. When we were both spent, we slumped in each other\u0027s arms. The driver behind us still looked apathetic, poor soul. Carefully lifting myself from Kellan\u0027s lap, I collapsed onto the bed with a content sigh. Kellan snuggled up next to me, his breath erratic. As I twisted to cuddle into his chest, Kellan let out a low groan. \"Oh . . . my . . . God . . . that was amazing.\" Containing my smile, I murmured, \"Well, looks like I didn\u0027t get to finish the alphabet either.\" I felt a little wobbly when I made my way to the shower later. I could hear snoring on the other side of the curtain separating our room and the bathroom from the rest of the bus. Good, probably nobody had heard us. Wow, what a way to wake up. My mind and body were completely energized and the creative juices were flowing. I kept my shower brief so I could get started on writing. Kellan was absent from our room when I went back to it, but it didn\u0027t take me long to find him. The bus was only so big, after all. Creeping past the people still slumbering, I made my way to the lounging area of the bus. The driver nodded at me and I waved, hoping he hadn\u0027t heard anything. I sometimes forgot about the drivers of our busses. This one was a sweet older man named Jonathan. Oh well, Jonathan was a professional bus driver for rock stars. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d heard and seen a lot. Kellan was seated on a plush chair near a table, strumming his guitar. He peeked up at me and smiled, and I took a moment to just appreciate him before making my way over. He nodded his head at a steaming cup on the table. \"Coffee? It\u0027s instant.\" He cringed. There was a small kitchen area near the bathrooms, with a microwave and a mini-fridge, but that was about it. I graciously accepted the cup anyway. \"Thank you.\" Kellan watched me set up my notes and laptop, then returned to his guitar. We worked side by side for a while, with Kellan\u0027s guitar and my keyboard making the only sound. Then Kellan started humming a song. It wasn\u0027t a melody I\u0027d heard before, and I paused the story in my head to listen to him work on something new. I guess I wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d been inspired this morning. I loved that we could be together, but could be doing our own thing too. We each had our own lives, our own joys, our own friends. We weren\u0027t dependent on each other for happiness, but being together sure amplified the feeling. As the minutes stretched on, I thought I could peacefully live out the rest of my days this way. Then an exclamation of surprise sounded from the back of the bus. Kellan and I both turned to look, but the curtain was still in place, and we couldn\u0027t see anything. We heard it, though. Or rather, we heard him. Louder than was necessary, Griffin was repeating, \"Oh my fucking God!\" over and over. Other people grumbled, while a few more loudly shushed him; it was still pretty early. Dread bubbled in my stomach. I was really apprehensive about anything that could shock Griffin. Kellan set down his guitar and stood up. \"Why don\u0027t you stay here?\" he said to me. For once, I did as he asked. My heart was beating harder as I watched the curtain swish closed behind Kellan. I heard a slew of excited whispers and mumbled complaints. I really had no idea what was going on. The longer Kellan stayed back there, the more curious I became. I half-stood a handful of times, only to sit back down again. Did I really want to know? Yes . . . and no. When I finally couldn\u0027t stand it, Kellan remerged. Maybe it was my imagination, but he looked a little paler. As he approached me, I thought I heard my cell phone going off in the very back of the bus. After it silenced, it went off again. Kellan quietly sat in the chair next to me while Griffin peeked his head out of the curtain. I couldn\u0027t tell if the look on his face was incredulity, excitement, or just uncontainable curiosity. He was pulled back into the sleeping section seconds later. My eyes were wide and fearful, my belly full of dread as I locked gazes with Kellan. \"What?\" I whispered. Kellan scrunched his brow, almost like he was at a loss for words. My cell phone was still incessantly ringing. While he thought, I murmured, \"Maybe I should get that. It could be my sister.\" Kellan\u0027s expression darkened. \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised.\" \"Kellan?\" Sighing, he placed a hand on my knee and said, \"Joey leaked the tape. It\u0027s all anyone is talking about this morning.\" My heart sank, but it quickly evened out. I\u0027d been expecting this bombshell. \"Oh, you had me worried for a minute.\" Kellan chewed on his lip, and I instantly knew there was more. \"What?\" I muttered. He rubbed his thumb around the temple of his skull, like he had a headache. \"Joey\u0027s camera was . . . fucking fabulous.\" His tone was harsh and sarcastic. Pausing his mind massage, he looked up at me. \"It\u0027s so grainy that she\u0027s hard to make out, so, because of Nick shoving me onto this tour, and all of the stories, photos, and speculation, everyone is just assuming that I\u0027m doing-\" My heart stopped. \"They think you made a sex tape with Sienna.\" Kellan nodded. \"They look enough alike that it\u0027s a really easy mistake to make. Plus, the angle wasn\u0027t that great, and there\u0027s no date on the tape. The only clear thing about it is that it\u0027s definitely me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"There is this one clear shot of my face, since I . . . started the recording . . . and Joey says my name a lot.\" A wave of nausea rolled through me, but I pushed it back. He\u0027d made that tape a long time ago. \"Oh, should you say something?\" \"Yes, absolutely, but . . .\" Kellan shrugged. \"I\u0027m not so sure that it will matter. People will believe what they want to believe.\" He closed his eyes that suddenly looked very tired. \"Even Griffin believes it\u0027s Sienna on the tape.\" Reopening his eyes, he cupped my cheek. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I think I just unintentionally gave them the irrefutable proof they were looking for. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to stop this now.\" Knowing he was probably right, I let out a weary sigh. We couldn\u0027t just make a statement and think that everyone would suddenly understand what was really going on. The public was too in love with the idea of Kellan and Sienna as a couple. No one had really believed Kellan before this tape exploded in our faces. They definitely wouldn\u0027t believe him now. With Kellan\u0027s very first \"No comment\" response, we had unwittingly helped fuel up a locomotive. Nick and Sienna had then taken control and sent it barreling down the tracks, and this sex tape had just snapped the brake lines. The gossip train was out of control now. All we could do was wait for its inevitable crash and hope we all survived the wreckage. I pushed my computer away, no longer inspired. I fielded phone calls after that, a lot of phone calls-my sister, Jenny, Cheyenne, Kate, and horrifyingly enough, my parents. They thankfully hadn\u0027t watched the videos or seen any still shots, but even my mom and dad couldn\u0027t escape the global gossip of Kellan and Sienna\u0027s sex tape. I don\u0027t think my mom believed me when I told her the wedding was still on. I finally calmed my parents down, but every single one of my friends had to be \"convinced\" that the video was years old. Eventually it came down to the tattoo. I gave all of them the assignment of watching the video and looking at Kellan\u0027s chest. If my name wasn\u0027t engraved above his heart, then they would know without a doubt that it was filmed before we were a couple. That fact wouldn\u0027t help me with the general public, since not a lot of people knew about his tattoo as it had been cleverly covered up for the music video, but it swayed my friends. By the time I hung up with them, they grudgingly believed me. Denny was the last phone call of the day-and the one I\u0027d been dreading the most. I was sitting on the bed I shared with Kellan when my phone rang. The bus had stopped a while ago, and the numerous roadies were out in force, setting up tonight\u0027s show. I had no idea what city we were in; I\u0027d already lost track. The boys were all out exploring, probably introducing Holeshot to their little drinking game. The two bands meshed together well, which didn\u0027t surprise me; the D-Bags were an easy-going group, they got along with most people. Kellan had asked me to go out with him, but I didn\u0027t want to. Then he\u0027d offered to stay in with me, but I didn\u0027t want that either. I wanted to be alone, staring at the rain streaking down the windowpane and contemplating the strangeness of my life. After he\u0027d gone, I\u0027d found a flower petal taped to the bathroom mirror with the words I\u0027m sorry on it. I knew he was. I was sorry too. I stared at my ringing phone in annoyance. I almost didn\u0027t have it in me to explain to yet another friend that Kellan wasn\u0027t having an affair with Sienna Sexton. It was a little irritating how quick they all were to jump on the \"He\u0027s a D-Bag\" train. But with the music video, the photos, the tour changeup, and now the sex tape, the evidence against him was pretty damning, and I didn\u0027t blame them too much. If I weren\u0027t here with Kellan, I might have believed it too. Seeing Denny\u0027s name on my screen, I hesitated, then picked it up. \"Hey, Denny,\" I answered, feeling sleepy. \"Hey . . . I bet you\u0027re tired of people calling you.\" I smiled for what felt like the first time in hours. \"You have no idea. But I\u0027m glad you called me.\" \"So . . . do I ask?\" \"It\u0027s Joey\u0027s tape, the one I told you about. She finally leaked it . . . and everyone thinks it\u0027s Sienna. It\u0027s kind of sad, really. Joey wanted to be in his spotlight so badly, and even with documented proof, she still can\u0027t get there.\" A humorless laugh escaped me. Denny exhaled a long breath. \"I figured that\u0027s what it was. Are you holding up okay?\" Relief flooded through me. It was so nice to not have to convince someone. \"I\u0027m as okay as I can be, considering Kellan is making front page news with another woman. Regardless of who that other woman is or isn\u0027t, it still sucks. I\u0027m afraid to even turn my computer on.\" \"Give it some time. They\u0027ll move on to something else soon.\" I shifted my gaze to a raindrop running down the window. Watching the rain was so peaceful. My life used to be peaceful. Wasn\u0027t it, just this morning? \"I know, but it\u0027s entirely possible that the next story they move on to will also include Kellan.\" I sniffed, hating that this was getting to me. \"I just miss . . .\" My voice trailed off. I was about to say that I missed nobody knowing who he was, but that was never true. Kellan had always had a swirl of notoriety around him. He was always a star. It was just on a much smaller scale at Pete\u0027s. Sharing him was nothing new, it was just more expansive now. Denny answered my open-ended statement. \"I know.\" Silence stretched out between us, then Denny added, \"You could always come home, Kiera. Let that world go for a while?\" Holding my knees tight to my chest, I considered it. I could stay home in an empty house, writing all day and night. I could visit my sister, my friends. I could even fly home to see my parents-briefly-and I could spend time with Denny. It sounded nice, familiar, comfortable, but . . . my heart was anchored to Kellan. Being apart from him stretched my soul in opposite directions. It was painful. No, it was torture. He was everything to me, and I didn\u0027t want to miss a moment of his journey just because parts of it were unpleasant. No. When I\u0027d agreed to be his wife, I\u0027d also been agreeing to stand beside him through thick or thin. And if I could stand by his side during the filming of that damn music video, then I could stand beside him while he dealt with the consequences of his reckless youth. I wasn\u0027t running, I wasn\u0027t avoiding-not anymore. \"No . . . I belong here with Kellan. But thank you for listening, Denny.\" When I ran into Sienna that night, she was all smiles, loving the attention. Of course, she acted mortified when she spoke with anyone who interviewed her. She even walked away from a gossip site reporter, throwing her hands into the air and stalking off like she was offended to the core of her being that something so private was being brought up in casual conversation. By her actions alone, the rumors were confirmed: Kellan and Sienna had made a sex tape together. The world went into a gossip mongering frenzy, and the glorifying of them as a couple exploded into the stratosphere. Kellan tried to put out the fire. Physically, he stayed as far away from her as possible, even going to the extreme of singing their duets on the other side of the stage as her. He told everyone who would listen that Sienna was not the girl in the video, and he was not, nor had he ever been, in a relationship with her. It was all too little, too late, though. Nothing could stop the gossip train. Two weeks after the tape\u0027s release, the sordid gossip was still going strong. We were in Atlanta, Georgia, a place I had always wanted to visit, and the boys were doing an early afternoon in-studio radio interview. I was sitting on a stool against the wall by Tory, who was always present when Kellan and the boys spoke to the press. While I was slumped against the wall, Tory sat ramrod straight, slightly leaning forward, ready to pounce. Her eyes watched the DJs like a hawk-or like a mama bear protecting her cubs. \"So, Kellan . . . rumors are going crazy. Anything you want to say about the lovely and quite talented Sienna Sexton?\" The DJ stressed the word talented, and everyone in the room knew he wasn\u0027t talking about her music. Kellan shifted on his seat. \"I\u0027ve said this about five million times, but she\u0027s an acquaintance of mine. We work together, nothing more.\" Tory\u0027s eyes tightened at Kellan\u0027s admission, but she knew, just like Nick and Sienna, that nothing Kellan said at this point really mattered-a fact the DJ confirmed seconds later. \"Right . . . work.\" He turned to his partner. \"That\u0027s a gig I wouldn\u0027t mind getting.\" They both let out hearty laughs while Kellan\u0027s expression darkened. \"I am not, nor have I ever been, in a relationship with Sienna.\" The men turned incredulous eyes to Kellan. \"So, that\u0027s not her on the tape with you?\" Kellan closed his eyes and seemed to count to ten before answering, \"No.\" The second male DJ responded with, \"Sure looks like her. Even freeze-framed.\" My stomach churned and my hands balled into fists. I hated that the odds were very good that everyone in this room had seen the tape of Kellan having sex. Well, everyone except for me. There was no way on this green earth that I was watching that. Some things can\u0027t be unseen, and Joey and Kellan going at it like porn stars was one of those things. Staring the DJ down, Kellan straightforwardly told him, \"I don\u0027t see what any of this has to do with my music, which is why I\u0027m here. The woman in the video was a girl I dated years ago, long before I ever met Sienna. While she happens to sort of resemble her, it\u0027s not Sienna Sexton.\" Both male DJs glanced at each other. \"It\u0027s sort of strange that no girl has come forward then, right? I mean, if this \u0027not-Sienna\u0027 you dated leaked the tape . . . where is she?\" He used air quotes, like he still didn\u0027t believe Kellan. This was unfortunately a sticky point for us. Joey hadn\u0027t made a peep. She hadn\u0027t come out to fight for her right as the proud participant in the video. She hadn\u0027t basked in the glow of Kellan\u0027s spotlight. She hadn\u0027t snatched her claim to fame. The only thing she\u0027d done so far was stay quiet as a mouse and let Sienna take all her \"glory.\" It seemed completely unlike Joey to me. Kellan stammered on his answer. \"I don\u0027t . . . I don\u0027t know.\" Knowing he was digging himself into a hole, Kellan turned around and glanced at Tory, silently asking her to shift the conversation. A female in a back booth chimed in with her thoughts. \"I think it\u0027s sweet that he protects Sienna by denying it. It\u0027s chivalrous.\" She pointed at the two DJs. \"You guys could learn a thing a two.\" I wanted to stab the girl with a pen. How much clearer did Kellan have to be? Tory stepped forward and made a cutting motion with her hand over her throat. The implication was clear to the DJs: End this line of questioning, or I pull my talent. They quickly redirected the interview toward the band\u0027s concert that night, and Kellan visibly relaxed. When the interview was over, Kellan walked over to me, his expression glum. He really hated that he couldn\u0027t steer the public\u0027s perception of him. He was a puppet, along for the ride, but not really a part of it. No, this show belonged entirely to Nick and Sienna. I patted his arm in sympathy, then I dropped my hand to my side. I was keeping public affection to a minimum. Not only did I still not want the world\u0027s attention focused on me, but things with \"Kell-Sex\" were just too crazy at the moment. And if Kellan couldn\u0027t control what people thought about him, then he definitely couldn\u0027t control what people thought about me. If the gossipers figured out who I was, they\u0027d never leave us alone. They would paint me as the other woman in the Kell-Sex love affair. I would be hated, reviled, possibly even egged. Being in an across-the-globe scandal freaked me out so much that I had even asked Kellan to switch his wedding ring to his right hand when we were out. I just didn\u0027t want to cause unnecessary problems for myself. The waters just needed to calm a little bit. And they would, as soon as this tour was over. In an absurd way, I was Kellan\u0027s dirty little secret. It was a disturbingly familiar feeling, one I didn\u0027t care for. I had no idea how we were going to keep our wedding in December quiet. Or if we even could. Marriage licenses were a matter of public record, right? Anyone searching deep enough for info on Kellan would find it. Since we had rolled into town this morning but the show wasn\u0027t until tonight, the bands were being put up in a hotel room. Kellan and I had decided to abandon our bus love nest for a spacious suite with a Jacuzzi. As an obscenely oversized SUV transported the D-Bags and company back to the hotel, my phone rang. Rummaging through my bag, I found my cell shoved between the pages of a book I was trying to read in my spare time. I was so busy writing that I would have had more luck reading an entire novel if Kellan read it to me. Actually, that wasn\u0027t a bad idea. Glancing at the screen, I answered with, \"Hey, sis. What\u0027s up?\" \"Where are you?\" Looking out the window, I told her, \"Atlanta, why?\" My sister huffed. \"I know you\u0027re in Atlanta. Where in Atlanta are you right at this very second?\" \"We\u0027re on the road. We just left the radio station and we\u0027re heading to the hotel, some swanky place in Buckheel, Buckhead, something like that. Why?\" My sister\u0027s tone brightened. \"Oh, good! I\u0027m coming to the show tonight. Can you flip a bitch and swing by the airport to pick me up?\" It took me a minute to register what she was saying. \"You\u0027re in Georgia?\" Twisting around from the front seat, Griffin echoed my question. \"Anna\u0027s in Georgia?\" His eyes damn near sparkled with the news. \"Awesome. Where is she?\" I answered Griffin with \"Airport,\" while my sister answered me. \"Yep! My flight just arrived.\" Dumbfounded, my only thought was, \"Why are you in Georgia?\" My second thought was Swing by? The airport was nowhere near our hotel. In fact, our hotel was a bit north of the heart of Atlanta, where the concert was tonight, while the airport was south. Going to get her was way out of our way. But I wouldn\u0027t abandon her at the airport. Neither would Griffin; he was already telling the driver to turn around. Anna snorted before she answered my question. \"I just told you why. Now come get me. Love you!\" Then she disconnected. I shook my head as I shoved the phone back in my purse. Of course my sister would travel over halfway across the country on a whim to watch a concert.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reckless-thoughtless-3/page-17.html","bookId":1885,"book":{"id":1885,"title":"Reckless (Thoughtless #3)","description":"Storyline: Reckless (Thoughtless #3) When the band hits it big, Kiera and Kellan must ask themselves: Can their love for each other survive the constant pressures of superstardom?
