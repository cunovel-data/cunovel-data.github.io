{"id":84104,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"The next morning started peacefully enough, but I knew it wouldn\u0027t last, not with my imminent exposure on the horizon. But as the sunlight streaming through the open window beside me caressed the bare patches of skin that Kellan and I showed as we lounged in our tangled, tousled sheets, that future concern seemed a far-distant event, one I didn\u0027t need to worry over just yet. Wanting to purr with contentment, like the fluffy cat I used to own as a child, I shut out the world and focused on the man in front of me. He was all that mattered anyway.\\n\\n Kellan seemed equally content as he traced the tender rectangle covering my wounded wrist. I knew we both had things we needed to do today, and we would eventually have to get up and deal with the gossip explosion that was probably already happening, but a few more minutes of quality time wouldn\u0027t hurt anything. And I had a feeling this might be the last peaceful moment we had for a while.\\n\\n That thought was confirmed for me about ten minutes later. Like reality was throwing a wet blanket over our serenity, my cell phone started going off, and Kellan\u0027s went off a few second later. I inhaled a deep breath as I locked gazes with Kellan. We both ignored the ringing for a moment, then Kellan whispered, \"Why did we get cell phones, again?\"\\n\\n Laughing, I kissed his nose. \"I suppose we should answer those. The photos must be out by now. People are probably worried.\" I cringed, wondering if my parents had seen the pictures yet. Dad was going to flip if he saw a picture of his daughter being called a whore.\\n\\n Kellan sighed, then nodded. He started to turn away, but I cupped his cheek. Ignoring the incessant ringing in the room, I looked deep into his eyes. \"Whatever happens from here on out, I want you to know that I don\u0027t regret anything. Being with you, loving you, experiencing this with you . . . it\u0027s all been worth it, and we\u0027ll get through this together.\" I smiled. \"We\u0027re a team. It\u0027s us against the world.\"\\n\\n Clearly moved by my declaration, Kellan murmured, \"Us against the world? That sounds like wonderful odds.\" Our phones were silent a second then started ringing again.\\n\\n I chuckled as I placed a light kiss on his lips. \"It\u0027s better than no odds at all.\"\\n\\n It took a minute for Kellan and me to disentangle ourselves. Somehow, we\u0027d wrapped the sheet over us and under us. We were giggling when we finally got the mess sorted out. It made me happy that even though this chaos was being shoved down our throats, we could still find tiny pockets of levity. I quickly tossed on some fresh clothes while Kellan pulled on his boxers. Before hurrying to my phone, I took five seconds to fully appreciate the sight of Kellan\u0027s tight abs and lean legs showcased by the silky black material. He was perfect, inside and out, and I really couldn\u0027t blame the world for being obsessed with him.\\n\\n Wondering which concerned loved one would get a hold of me first, I glanced down at the screen before picking up. I smiled when I saw Denny\u0027s name. No matter what, Denny would always be on my side.\\n\\n \"Hey, Denny,\" I said, bringing the phone to my ear. Kellan was across the room, also on his cell phone now.\\n\\n \"Kiera, you okay?\" His accent around my name was just as warm, sweet, and caring as the first day I\u0027d heard it. \"Have you seen the news? Your face is everywhere. They know about you. They\u0027re all calling you Kellan\u0027s mistress.\"\\n\\n I sighed as I sat on the edge of the bed. \"I haven\u0027t seen it yet, but I knew it was coming. That creeper ambushed us yesterday when we thought we were alone.\" Cringing, I asked, \"So, how much do the Kell-Sex fanatics hate me?\"\\n\\n Denny let out a long sigh that said it all. \"Well, let\u0027s just say that some of them are very . . . passionate. And inventive. Just hope you don\u0027t ever find yourself in any dark alleys with them.\" I laughed at that, and Denny sighed again. \"I hate to sound like a broken record, mate, but you could always come back home if it gets too rough.\" Laughing a little, he added, \"Abby even said she\u0027d hide you in our closet if things got too bad.\"\\n\\n I let out an unladylike snort. \"Yeah, fleeing back home and hiding out with my ex and his girlfriend-that wouldn\u0027t be awkward at all.\" Having heard my comment, Kellan smirked at me.\\n\\n After a long stretch of silence, Denny quietly told me, \"Fiancee. I asked Abby to marry me, and she said yes.\"\\n\\n Even though I\u0027d been expecting it, my stomach dropped. This must have been how he felt when Kellan and I \"got married\" right in front of him. Swallowing, I pushed down the microscopic amount of hurt in my belly and fully embraced the epic amount of joy I felt for my best friend. \"Denny, that\u0027s . . . Congratulations. I\u0027m so happy for you, for the both of you. You deserve a wonderful life, and I know Abby will give it to you.\"\\n\\n He exhaled, relief in his voice. \"Thank you. I was . . . nervous to tell you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be nervous to tell me good news. You and I are past that point in our relationship. I hope we are, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"We are,\" he agreed.\\n\\n The second I disconnected with Denny, my phone rang again. I had a feeling I would be fielding a lot of phone calls today. I was really sick and tired of fielding phone calls. I grimaced as I glanced at the screen. Hitting the connect button, I brought the phone to my ear. \"Hi, Daddy.\"\\n\\n I kept my voice as carefree as possible, but it didn\u0027t work. My dad\u0027s response was, \"You need to come home now!\"\\n\\n Making myself comfortable on the bed, I spent the next twenty minutes convincing my father that I was fine, and Kellan was fine, and everything was peachy keen, so he had absolutely nothing to worry about. I hoped I wasn\u0027t lying.\\n\\n Kellan let Jenny and Rachel into the room while I was frantically trying to get off of the phone with my father; he was three seconds away from coming to Philly to collect me. Once I successfully disconnected, Jenny gave me a hug. \"Hey, Rachel and I are heading to the airport now. I just wanted to say goodbye before we left.\"\\n\\n When Jenny and I pulled apart, I noticed that her normally bright face wasn\u0027t as chipper as it usually was. Beside her, Rachel looked equally distressed. \"I hate what the media is doing to you. They\u0027re making you out to be some two-bit hussy.\"\\n\\n Kellan\u0027s phone rang again, and sighing, he turned away as he answered it; he was still in his boxers. Rachel was purposely keeping her eyes averted from Kellan\u0027s sculpted body; Jenny didn\u0027t even seem to notice.\\n\\n Sighing at Jenny\u0027s comment, I peeked over at the bed. Kellan had brought me my laptop last night, as well as my overnight bag. While I\u0027d been busy convincing my dad that there was nothing to worry about, I\u0027d hopped online to find the story about me. It hadn\u0027t been hard. The news page that the web opened up on was showcasing the drama in their \"Top Story\" section. There was something really weird about a couple of rock stars\u0027 dating woes being splashed all over a reputable news site.\\n\\n There were three shots of Kellan and me highlighted in the article. One of the photos was a close-up of our faces, snapped while we were kissing. Kellan was grieving in that picture, and the distress on his face was as clear as my lips upon his. The second was a moment later, when we\u0027d noticed that we were being filmed. We were both looking directly at the photographer, shock on our faces; even surprised, Kellan looked pained. The shots were so zoomed in that the graveyard was nowhere to be seen. Thanks to the emotion on Kellan\u0027s face, it really did look like he was cheating on Sienna, and was torn up about it. I\u0027d been comforting him at the time, but in the photo I came across as a stone cold adulteress, seducing him into being unfaithful to the woman he loved.\\n\\n The last photo, the money shot, was Kellan standing above the photographer after knocking him to the ground. Looking thoroughly pissed off, Kellan seemed like he wanted to continue pummeling the man-a guilty adulterer furious about being caught red-handed. It was a gossip goldmine, and it was all very misleading and very incriminating.\\n\\n Following my gaze, Jenny pointed at the computer. \"I feel so bad for having to leave you in the middle of this circus.\"\\n\\n Watching Kellan run his hand through his hair while he talked with someone on his cell phone, I told her, \"Being with him is always going to be a circus.\" Smiling, I looked back at her. \"He\u0027s worth it, though.\"\\n\\n Jenny gave me another hug. \"We have to go, but call me whenever you need to. Okay?\" We separated, and her hand rubbed my arm. \"And have faith.\"\\n\\n Swallowing back sudden tears, I told her I did. Faith was one of the few things I had right now. Rachel and I exchanged a brief hug next, and then my two friends disappeared from my life again. A brief surge of loneliness swelled in me; I\u0027d really enjoyed my girl time. I quickly reminded myself that I\u0027d get to see them again at my wedding, and in the meantime I had my sister to keep me company. I wondered if she\u0027d seen this yet.\\n\\n Kellan looked around the room when he finally got off his phone. \"The girls leave?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n Kellan nodded and lifted the phone in his fingers. Grim amusement on his lips, he told me, \"My dad and Hailey called. They\u0027re both concerned about you. Hailey is worried that you\u0027ll be lynched by the fans before this is all cleared up.\" He frowned, like he kind of thought that too.\\n\\n Running my arms around his neck, I told him,\"We\u0027ll sort this out, but right now, you have that private performance to get ready for.\" I lifted my brow as I reminded him that he still had a job to do in all of this madness.\\n\\n Kellan dropped his head back. \"God, I\u0027d forgotten all about that.\" Looking like he really wanted to call in sick, he said, \"I was hoping to sit down with someone this afternoon, make a formal statement about that picture, but I\u0027m not going to have time.\"\\n\\n Placing my palm on the tattoo of my name over his heart, I leaned up and kissed him. As if to punctuate just what he\u0027d said, both of our cell phones started ringing again and Tory pounded on our door. \"Ten minutes, Kyle!\"\\n\\n I was done hiding our relationship. So, when the dark SUV the label hired dropped us off at the venue, I held hands with Kellan as we walked inside. The swarm of paparazzi waiting on the other side of the security fence was massive; I\u0027d never seen so many cameras in all my life. They immediately reacted when they saw the two of us together. Flashbulbs blinked on and off in rhythmic, random patterns. The crowd clamoring for the best shot of Kellan and I looked like a wide, chaotic Christmas tree, its lights struggling to outshine the sun on this crisp fall afternoon. The tall man in the middle only needed an angel on his head to complete the effect. I was grateful for the warmth and strength emanating from Kellan\u0027s hand as he squeezed mine tight-I felt like my entire body was falling apart, I was shaking so much.\\n\\n This was so far outside of my comfort zone that I was pretty sure I was bumping into someone else\u0027s comfort zone. But instead of cowering and hiding, I lifted my head and straightened my back. I wasn\u0027t doing anything wrong, and I had nothing to be ashamed or afraid of. The fans in the crowd took my resolve as arrogance. Words drifted over the lot. Hurtful words-whore, slut, home wrecker, bitch, and several others that I couldn\u0027t even repeat in my own head. Kellan was squeezing my palm painfully hard by the time we were safely behind closed doors. I shook my hand so he\u0027d let some blood flow back into my fingers.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" he murmured. \"I had to hold on to you to stop myself from smacking a few heads.\"\\n\\n I smiled up at him. \"Considering that most of the bodies attached to those heads are young, female fans of yours, I\u0027d say it\u0027s a very good thing that you didn\u0027t punch any of them.\"\\n\\n He wrapped his arms around my waist. \"Well, don\u0027t think I didn\u0027t want to.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t think I didn\u0027t want to either,\" I joked. Well, half-joked.\\n\\n Kellan and I found our way to the D-Bags\u0027 dressing room. The rest of the D-Bags were already there when we entered. Anna was too. Standing next to a small table overflowing with snacks, she was pouring a bag of M\u0026Ms into a gigantic bowl of freshly popped popcorn. Plodding over to a chair, she eased herself down and balanced the bowl on her belly. As Kellan walked over to Matt and Evan, I sat beside her.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I muttered, watching the bowl shift a little as Maximus moved beneath it.\\n\\n Anna shoved a handful of popcorn and chocolate into her mouth. \"Hey, heard you\u0027re a bitch whore for stealing Sienna\u0027s man.\"\\n\\n Leaning my head back on the chair, I smiled over at my sister. \"Yep. I officially, globally suck.\"\\n\\n Anna chewed her food for a minute, then smiled. \"Well, cunt or not, I still love you.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Mrs. Hancock, I love you too.\" Laughing, I reached over for some popcorn. Anna smacked my hand away.\\n\\n \"Loving you doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m sharing my popcorn.\" She pointed over to the table. \"Grab your own goodies . . . bitch whore.\"\\n\\n Exaggerating a grieved groan, I prepared myself to stand up. I paused when I noticed Anna cringing and pressing a knuckle into her back. \"You okay, sis?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Yeah, just a backache. It comes and goes . . . I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n She seemed pale to me, her face wan and weary. Maybe it was just because she wasn\u0027t wearing her usual expertly applied eye shadow and mascara. I was used to seeing my sister all done up. It used to drive my dad crazy that she rarely went anywhere without makeup. He\u0027d often say, \"Why do you need mascara if you\u0027re just going to sit in a dark movie theater?\" Her answer was always the same, \"Because I have to walk through the lobby to get there, Dad.\" Just the fact that she hadn\u0027t decorated her eyes today spoke volumes on how tired she was.\\n\\n \"Anna, maybe you should go back to the bus and lie down.\"\\n\\n She shook her head; even her hair seemed a little lackluster today. \"I want to listen to the show. Griff\u0027s going to do a little solo for me.\" Her smile, while still clearly pained, was full of love for her husband. God, I still couldn\u0027t get used to that word being connected with Griffin.\\n\\n Tory came in a bit later to grab the guys for their meet-and-greet. Not wanting to disrupt Kellan\u0027s job by unnecessarily riling up his fans, I decided to stay in the dressing room. Anna looked too comfortable to follow Griffin, so she stayed behind with me. Or maybe she wasn\u0027t comfortable at all. I couldn\u0027t tell. She seemed fine on the surface, but every few minutes she would get a weird, focused look on her face, and she\u0027d start inhaling and exhaling in a slow, controlled way. Then she\u0027d be fine and she\u0027d resume munching her popcorn. It was strange.\\n\\n \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay, Anna?\"\\n\\n Squishing an M\u0026M between her fingers, she frowned. \"No, actually.\" Tilting her head to examine her bowl of snacks, she complained, \"All of the chocolate shifted to the bottom of the bowl.\"\\n\\n Giving her a not-amused expression, I pointed to her back. \"I meant physically. Everything all right?\"\\n\\n Anna waved away my concern. \"It\u0027s just a backache. It happens when you\u0027re carrying around a hundred pound bowling ball. It will go away if I keep my feet up.\" To emphasize her point, she wriggled her toes, which were stretched out on a chair in front of her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Anna, maybe you should see a doctor. When was the last time you saw one?\" Anna hadn\u0027t exactly been keeping up on her checkups since leaving Seattle. I wasn\u0027t sure what they did at all of those doctor\u0027s appointments, but they probably had advice on backaches.\\n\\n Anna rolled her eyes at me. \"For a backache? What are they going to do at a hospital? Have me sit down, that\u0027s what. And I\u0027m doing that, so . . . I\u0027m following my doctor\u0027s orders before even receiving them.\" She smiled at me. \"Because I\u0027m that good.\"\\n\\n I was about to answer her sarcastic comment when she whimpered and hissed in a sharp breath. The bowl of popcorn rolled off her stomach and crashed to the floor, scattering everywhere. Both of her hands clamped onto her back, frantically massaging the muscles around her hips. Seeing the pain on her face, I turned her and moved behind her. Pressing my thumbs deep into her lower back, I watched my sister lean forward and struggle to breathe calmly without groaning in pain. My heart began to race as I quickly started realizing that this was so much more than a backache. This was my nephew knocking, and he wanted out.\\n\\n \"Anna, you have to go to a hospital. You\u0027re in labor.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. Voice strained, she reiterated, \"It\u0027s just a backache, Kiera. I\u0027m not due until next week.\"\\n\\n I wanted to smack my sister over the head like Kellan sometimes smacked Griffin, but I couldn\u0027t bring myself to stop massaging her while she was in so much pain. \"Hardly anybody actually gives birth on their due date, Anna.\"\\n\\n Groaning, she muttered, \"Then why the hell is it called a due date? It should be called an estimated date of delivery.\"\\n\\n Controlling my smile, I told her, \"Well, no matter what it\u0027s called, the baby decides when to arrive, and regardless of what you have to say on the matter, it looks like Maximus wants to be born today.\"\\n\\n Anna simpered and pointed at the colorful sea of M\u0026Ms resting at the edge of the toppled bowl. \"But my chocolate . . .\"\\n\\n Massaging her with one hand, I grabbed my bag and rooted around for my phone. \"Your snack will just have to wait, Anna.\"\\n\\n I found my phone once again hiding inside the book I was only halfway through. Yanking it free of the pages, I scrolled through my numbers and dialed Kellan. He didn\u0027t pick up. I tried Griffin next. He didn\u0027t pick up either. Not expecting anything different, I tried Evan and Matt, then Kellan again. Nobody picked up. I wasn\u0027t too surprised. Tory had a strict no-cell policy when it was time to meet with fans. Deacon had answered his once during a greeting, and Tory had ripped him a new one once all the fans had left. She may place rock stars higher on the priority list than the general public, but she understood just who it was who bought the CDs.\\n\\n \"Damn, I\u0027m going to have to go get them.\" Which also meant I was going to have to barge into a room full of Kell-Sex supporters. I really didn\u0027t have a choice, though.\\n\\n Anna nodded, a groan escaping her. \"Get Griffin . . . I want Griffin.\" She sounded like a little girl, lost and afraid.\\n\\n I patted her back, then stood up to go find her husband. Her voice made me pause at the door. \"Kiera!\" she shrieked.\\n\\n When I turned back to her, she was looking at me with panic clear on her face. \"I think I just peed my pants.\"\\n\\n I shot back over to her. Her black stretchy pants were soaked, and the chair beneath her was wet. My mouth dropped open. \"No, I think your water just broke.\"\\n\\n My sister officially started to freak out. \"No, no, no! I am not giving birth backstage at a rock concert. I need to be in a hospital, pumped full of every drug that they can legally give me!\"\\n\\n I was so shocked, my only response was, \"Well, he was conceived backstage at a concert, so it\u0027s sort of fitting for him to be born at one.\"\\n\\n Anna smacked my arm, and not gently. I was going to be bruised tomorrow. \"Get me to a fucking hospital, Kiera!\"\\n\\n Not wanting to endanger myself any further, I turned and fled the room. For the first time since this tour began, I couldn\u0027t find a single person. Not a damn roadie in sight. There were usually people running around, doing something, but nobody was backstage. It was like a ghost town. Cursing my bad luck, I ran to the one spot I knew held people . . . lots of people. It was where I needed to go anyway, since Griffin was in that room.\\n\\n I could hear squeaks and squeals as I approached the room, and figured the parade past the rock stars had just begun. The doors were wide open when I got there, and a few excited fans were just starting to trickle out. Some had red cheeks, like they\u0027d been crying. Needing to get to Griffin, I breezed past them. One gasped and exclaimed, \"Is that Kellan\u0027s whore?\" Another replied, \"Yeah, I think it is. I can\u0027t believe her nerve. What is she doing here?\"\\n\\n I gritted my jaw and ignored them. I had much more important things on my plate right now than gossip. When I burst into the room, my eyes instantly locked on Kellan. His went wide when he saw me. Alarm spread over his features as clear as day. He knew I wouldn\u0027t come in here unless it was absolutely necessary. I knew the fans would take his alarm as panic-Oh no, my mistress is in the same room as my girlfriend-but I knew that Kellan sensed something was wrong, very wrong.\\n\\n Standing beside Sienna, he tried to step forward to get to me, but the crowd of fans wasn\u0027t letting him move. He wasn\u0027t who I needed to see, though.\\n\\n Ignoring him, I cut through the twisting lines of fans to get to Griffin. That got me a lot of unwanted attention. A silence fell around me that quickly turned into harsh whispers. I made out a lot of \"It\u0027s her! She\u0027s here! What a bitch!\" As people started realizing who I was, people started reacting. At first, they just wouldn\u0027t let me get through them. I asked politely, I nudged, but it was like the wall of fans had suddenly turned to stone; they all had questions, and they weren\u0027t moving until they got some answers. Panic set in. My sister was going to have a baby. She needed her husband. I needed to get through. That\u0027s all I could think about. In my haste, I started shoving through them. None too thrilled with me, they shoved right back. While the area around me started turning into a mosh pit, I did start making some progress . . . especially when they started shoving me from behind. Hey, whatever it took to get me to Griffin.\\n\\n Just as I was almost to him, I was shoved up against some tough-looking girl sporting a bright pink fauxhawk. She also was wearing a Kell-Sex shirt. I wanted to sigh when the recognition flashed in her eyes. She didn\u0027t even give me a chance to politely excuse myself so I could move around her. No, much to the delight of everyone around her, she full on slapped me. I\u0027d never been slapped before, and I had a newfound appreciation for how much it sucked. I vowed to never hit a human being again, even if they deserved it.\\n\\n My left ear was ringing, but I clearly heard Kellan shout, \"Hey!\" There was commotion behind me, but I took the fans\u0027 moment of distraction to finally make my way to Griffin. His eyes were just as wide as Kellan\u0027s had been. \"Holy shit, she actually hit you. You okay?\"\\n\\n Anger clouded Griffin\u0027s face as he glared at the fauxhawked fan. Not needing him to defend my honor right now, I grabbed his hand. \"Anna\u0027s in labor. Her water broke. We have to get her to a hospital . . . now!\"\\n\\n His mouth dropped. \"She\u0027s . . .\" His eyes flashed to the door blocked by hundreds of fans no longer waiting patiently in organized lines. I could hear Tory trying to calm them down, and I could hear Kellan calling my name. I ignored it all as I focused on Griffin. His eyes came back to mine, concerned. \"She okay?\"\\n\\n I shook my head and pulled on his arm. \"No . . . she\u0027s freaking out, and I had to leave her alone to come find you.\"\\n\\n Griffin nodded, then started shoving his way forward. He wasn\u0027t as nice or as polite as I\u0027d been. \"Get the fuck out of my way!\" Still holding my hand, he pulled me through the sea of startled fans. Matt and Evan tried to follow, but they were swallowed up by the crowd closing in behind our wake. When I passed by Kellan, I yelled over the din, \"Anna! Hospital!\"\\n\\n Kellan understood immediately and turned to Sienna. The poor, frazzled fans in the room had absolutely no clue what was going on, but they took the chaos I\u0027d created as an opportunity to bypass social politeness and swarm their beloved stars. Kellan was crushed back into the wall by eager people wanting his attention. The fans not close enough to love on him hated on me. I was cursed at, tripped, and I\u0027m pretty sure someone spat in my hair. Griffin pulled me through the mayhem and out into the relative safety of the hallway. Things 1 and 2 rushed into the room after we left. I hoped they took the time to free Kellan as well as Sienna. I quickly prayed his fans wouldn\u0027t hurt him, then rushed after Griffin toward my sister.\\n\\n Anna was pacing the room when we got there, rubbing her back and exhaling loudly. Sweat beaded her brow as she glanced at the door. The pain in her face eased to relief when she saw Griffin. \"Griff? This is starting to really fucking hurt.\"\\n\\n Griffin ran his hands back through his hair. \"Okay, no problem. We\u0027ll get you to a hospital, and they\u0027ll knock you out.\" He rushed over to her and supported her arm as he helped her from the room.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to burst Anna\u0027s bubble that it was probably too late for drugs, but I did feel like I should mention one tiny little detail that they both seemed to be forgetting about. \"What about tonight\u0027s show?\"\\n\\n Griffin immediately remembered where he was. \"Fuck!\" His eyes bored into mine. \"You know our songs. You play for me.\"\\n\\n \"I can barely strum a guitar!\"\\n\\n Griffin patted me on the back as he walked past me. \"You\u0027ll do fine. Good luck!\"\\n\\n I watched him walk away, wondering if I\u0027d really just become the replacement bassist for the D-Bags. Shaking my head, I ran after Griffin. \"No, I\u0027m coming to the hospital with you guys. I\u0027d probably get egged on stage anyway.\"\\n\\n Griffin was beyond caring about his band\u0027s fate as he rubbed Anna\u0027s back. \"Matt will handle it. He handles everything.\" I silently prayed Matt didn\u0027t have an aneurism tonight.\\n\\n As we opened the rear exit, I wondered if I should call a cab or an ambulance. But it turned out that I didn\u0027t need to call either. A car from the label pulled up as Anna huffed and puffed her way down the stairs. The young driver looked startled at the sight before him, but swiftly opened the door for Anna and Griffin. As I climbed in, I remembered Kellan turning to talk to Sienna before they were mobbed. He must have asked for her to get a car here. I made a mental note to thank Sienna later.\\n\\n As the driver hurried us along the streets of Philadelphia, the phone still clutched in my hand rang. It was Kellan. Grateful that he hadn\u0027t been crushed to death, I answered, \"Hey, you\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n Kellan let out a long exhale. \"I was going to say the same thing. I can\u0027t believe that bitch hit you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\" My cheek was still warm from the slap, and it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if I had finger marks on my skin, but I was doing considerably better than my sister. She was breathing hard, tears pricking the corners of her eyes as she clenched her jaw and struggled to contain the pain.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Anna?\" Kellan asked while I watched her from the front seat.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s . . . okay.\" Anna closed her eyes as a pained noise escaped her. More tenderly than I ever would have thought possible, Griffin held her in his arms and whispered words of encouragement in her ear. They were a heartwarming sight, and suddenly the idea of Griffin beside my family on Christmas morning didn\u0027t sound quite so odd.\\n\\n In my ear, Kellan told me, \"I wish I could be there with you, but Matt\u0027s freaking out about the show. David is going to fill in for Griffin, and we\u0027re having an emergency practice session to get him up to speed. But I\u0027ll tell Sienna I\u0027m skipping the encore tonight and come after our set. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll understand.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure if she would, but I also knew she\u0027d have to chain Kellan up if she wanted him to stay put. \"Okay, I\u0027ll see you then. Good luck.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you too.\" He laughed dryly.\\n\\n When we pulled up to the emergency room of one the many hospitals in the city, I quickly texted Denny. We had a plethora of friends back home who would want to know Anna was having her baby tonight, so I asked him to relay the message. Griffin was helping Anna out of the car so I hopped out and ran around to help him. Between the two of us, we got her to the emergency room doors. She kept trying to squat, like she had to pee. Hoping she wasn\u0027t doing what I think she was doing, I urgently told her, \"Don\u0027t push yet, Anna, we\u0027re almost there.\"\\n\\n Her eyes flashed over to mine. \"It\u0027s not exactly something I can control. You have no idea what this feels like!\"\\n\\n \"I know, just try,\" I nodded.\\n\\n Heads looked up when the three of us entered the peaceful room; thankfully it was a slow night. Griffin met eyes with a nurse at the desk. \"We need help! My wife\u0027s about to pop.\"\\n\\n A small bit of relief washed through me that Griffin had managed to state what he needed without cursing. The nurse hopped up and grabbed a wheelchair for Anna. She handed Griffin a clipboard of paperwork. \"I\u0027ll need you to fill out these while I admit her.\"\\n\\n Griffin looked at the stack of papers like they were written in a foreign language. \"I\u0027m not filling out fucking forms while my wife gives birth. Are you fucking crazy, lady?\"\\n\\n Exhaling in exasperation, I snatched the clipboard from Griffin. So much for him not swearing. \"I\u0027ll fill them out. You go with Anna.\" To the nurse, I added, \"We think her water already broke.\"\\n\\n The nurse nodded and started wheeling Anna through the double doors. Griffin was right on her heels. Before he disappeared, he tossed over his shoulder, \"Thanks, Kiera.\"\\n\\n I sighed and sat down, knowing that my nephew was most likely going to be born while I was filling out the damn paperwork. But Anna and Griffin doing this alone seemed appropriate.\\n\\n When I finished with the clipboard, I handed it to the nurse who\u0027d admitted my sister. She told me where Anna had been taken. I passed by a gift shop on the way there and stopped to buy my sister a blue teddy bear. Feeling the silky blue ribbon wrapped around the bear\u0027s neck, I made my way up to the birthing rooms.\\n\\n Walking over to the nurse\u0027s station, I started to ask for Anna\u0027s room when I spotted Griffin. He was walking down the hall in a daze. A stream of fear washed through me at the look on his face. Walking past me, he slumped into a chair in the waiting room. Torn between talking to him and rushing to my sister\u0027s side, I tentatively sat beside him. \"Griffin? You . . . okay?\"\\n\\n His face still blank, he looked over at me. His pale eyes were wider than I\u0027d ever seen. \"That . . . was . . . the most . . . disgusting thing . . . I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\\n\\n My fear vanished. She was okay. I patted his knee and his expression changed. Peace filled his face. \"And the most incredible.\" His eyes filled to the brim and I felt my throat tightening. \"You should have seen Anna, Kiera. She was so brave.\" I nodded and had the oddest desire to hug him. Before I could he added, \"You can see her now. She\u0027s absolutely beautiful . . . perfect, just like her mom.\"\\n\\n It took a minute for what he\u0027d said to register. \"She? Anna had a girl?\"\\n\\n Griffin nodded as a tear rolled down his cheek. \"Damn tech was wrong. Anna was right . . . She usually is.\" My hands flew to my mouth as a sob escaped me. Then I tossed my arms around Griffin and held him tight. He laughed and cried in my arms, and I felt something for Griffin that I had never felt before-a deep, familial love.\\n\\n Drying my cheeks, I hopped up out of the chair. \"What room?\"\\n\\n Standing, Griffin pointed down the hall he\u0027d just come from. \"There. I\u0027ll take you.\"\\n\\n My sister looked drained and radiant as we walked into the room. She was holding a tiny bundle wrapped in pink blankets and wearing a pastel striped hat. I started crying again. When Anna looked up at me, her cheeks were wet. \"I did it, Kiera.\"\\n\\n I leaned down to hug her, overwhelmed. \"I knew you would do great.\" She adjusted the tiny person resting on her chest so I could see the baby\u0027s face. She was plump, pink perfection, with pudgy cheeks that begged to be kissed. Like she knew I was watching, she opened her slate blue eyes and gazed at me. Her mouth opened, like she was already trying to smile. Griffin was right, she was absolutely breathtaking, quite possibly the most beautiful thing I\u0027d ever seen. No, she definitely was the most beautiful thing I\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n One small hand was free of the blankets encasing her, and I gently reached out to touch her. Her fingers instinctively wrapped around my pinky, and I sobbed again. Lifting the blue bear in my other hand, I told Anna, \"I guess I need to go exchange this for a pink one.\"\\n\\n Anna nodded. \"I told that cow I was having a girl.\"\\n\\n As I stroked the baby\u0027s fingers, I asked them both, \"So . . . Myrtle, huh?\"\\n\\n Anna scoffed. \"No. There was no way I was naming my baby Myrtle. We picked something better.\"\\n\\n I looked between the two of them. When had they picked out another girl name? They\u0027d been dead set on Maximus for months. Griffin smirked, and I started to worry about just what they\u0027d named my niece.\\n\\n \"Her name\u0027s Gibson.\" He gestured in the air like he was playing a guitar, and I understood the reference. Gibson was a brand of guitars. It was kind of a strange name for a baby, especially a baby girl, but it was the perfect name for a rock star\u0027s child. I immediately fell in love with it.\\n\\n Smiling, I kissed her cheek. \"Hello, Gibson, it\u0027s so nice to finally meet you.\"\\n\\n A thought struck me, and I glanced up at my beaming sister. My mom had been calling my sister nonstop for the last two weeks, trying to fly out to Seattle so she wouldn\u0027t miss the birth. Anna had been delaying her, telling her it was too soon to fly out. Honestly, I think she just didn\u0027t want to tell her that she wasn\u0027t in Seattle like Mom and Dad thought. Mom was going to be furious that she\u0027d missed her first grandchild being born.\\n\\n \"Anna,\" I piped up. \"Mom\u0027s going to kill us.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reckless-thoughtless-3/page-23.html","bookId":1885,"book":{"id":1885,"title":"Reckless (Thoughtless #3)","description":"Storyline: Reckless (Thoughtless #3) \\n When the band hits it big, Kiera and Kellan must ask themselves: Can their love for each other survive the constant pressures of superstardom?
