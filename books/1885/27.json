{"id":84108,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"When I came to, someone was shining a light in my eyes. It hurt. I hurt. I couldn\u0027t remember where I was. My head hurt, and I felt so nauseated. Why did I feel nauseated? Hating the brightness piercing my brain, I tried to look away, but something around my neck made it hard to do. What was that? From the corner of my eye, I could tell that I was lying on a city street; there was headlight glass and debris around my head. And a jagged piece of metal covered in blood. Fresh blood. Why was I lying in a street? Was I blocking traffic? People must be so pissed at me. I should get up. I didn\u0027t want to move, though. I had a feeling that would hurt.\n My mind in a fog, I felt hands lifting me, then placing me on a flat, white table. It did hurt to move, and I cringed and sucked in a sharp breath. Why was someone putting me on a table? Why was there a table in the middle of the road? A man in a reflective jacket was asking me questions.\n \"Ma\u0027am, do you know where you are? Do you know what happened?\"\n My body felt so heavy. My mind felt so slow. Blood was dripping down my face. I could feel it in my eyes. \"I . . . I . . . don\u0027t . . .\"\n Memories floating through my brain. Headlights coming toward me. Brakes squealing. Falling. \"I was hit by a truck,\" I muttered.\n \"Yes, that\u0027s right.\" A bandage was placed on my head. My head. I remembered hitting my head on the ground. That\u0027s why I hurt. That\u0027s why I was bleeding. But my body hurt too. My shoulder ached. I felt bruised. Kellan pulled me to my feet. I hit him before hitting the ground.\n I instantly tried to sit up. \"Kellan!\"\n The paramedic pushed me down and tried to stabilize me. My eyes flew to where Kellan had last been. All I saw was glass and blood; no Kellan. \"You have a nasty cut, ma\u0027am. I need to bandage this and make sure you don\u0027t have any other injuries. You could make things worse by moving. Do you know your name?\" he asked, his voice gentle.\n \"Kiera Allen . . . Kyle. Where\u0027s my husband?\" I asked, my voice raw.\n The paramedic\u0027s hands worked on my head. I tried to hold still for him, but all I wanted to do was run up and down the street screaming Kellan\u0027s name. \"The other paramedics are working on him, Kiera. He\u0027s in good hands.\"\n Even though my vision was a little blurry, I noticed the paramedic look to our left. My soul filling with trepidation, my gaze followed. Kellan was lying on a stretcher similar to the one I was on. He was covered in blood too, and I didn\u0027t know if it was his or mine. And not knowing scared the crap out of me. \"Kellan!\"\n I shouted his name, but he didn\u0027t respond. He was shaking. He looked ill. Then, to my absolute horror, he leaned over and vomited blood.\n Panic set in, and I tried to get to him, but the paramedic held me down and my stretcher was shoved into the back of an ambulance. \"Is he okay? Is he okay?\" I just kept repeating it. I couldn\u0027t stop myself.\n Before I got an answer, the doors were closed and the vehicle took off. The sirens hurt my ears, but it was nothing compared to the ache in my chest. Why was he throwing up blood? Was he okay? He had to be okay.\n Holding my hand, the paramedic told me, \"They\u0027ll do everything they can for him. I promise.\"\n His words didn\u0027t help me much. I started sobbing.\n I felt numb when we got to the hospital. Words hit my ears, but I couldn\u0027t process any of them. Someone said I was in shock. Someone mentioned concussion. Head injury. Internal injuries. None of the words stuck, though, because a vision of Kellan heaving blood was all I could think about. I was poked, prodded, and my stomach was pushed and massaged. I was sore, my shoulder throbbed, but I wasn\u0027t hurt. Only not knowing Kellan\u0027s fate hurt.\n He arrived at the ER right as a nurse injected a numbing agent into my head; I had to get stitches for the cut on my scalp. I saw him being wheeled past my room and hopped off the bed. Kellan wasn\u0027t vomiting, but he wasn\u0027t awake either. He looked completely lifeless. It scared the shit out of me.\n My nurse hurried after me, telling me I needed her attention. The nurses hovering around Kellan were telling the doctor in their midst just what had happened to Kellan. I stayed back so I could listen without them seeing me; I did not want to be dragged away until I knew what was wrong. \"Young male, early twenties, involved in a car accident. Was confused and light-headed at the scene, vomiting blood. Abdomen is distended, he has tachycardia and is hypotensive.\"\n The doctor nodded as he checked Kellan\u0027s vitals. He pulled up his shirt, and even I could see his stomach was bulging. He tenderly pressed on it and Kellan\u0027s eyes opened as he gasped in pain. \"He\u0027s bleeding internally. Prep him for surgery.\"\n That got my attention. Stepping forward, I asked the doctor, \"Surgery? Is it bad? Is my husband going to be okay?\"\n The doctor gave me a polite smile. \"I\u0027ll do everything I can.\" Blocking my path, he examined my head as Kellan was carted away from me. \"You really need stitches for this cut.\"\n He nodded his head at the nurse behind me. She gently grabbed my arms and pulled me back into the exam room. Kellan was already gone, and I knew there was nothing I could do for him by trying to follow. Tears in my eyes, I turned to my nurse. \"Do you know what happened to him?\"\n The nurse sat me on the table and pressed some gauze against my head. \"Most likely, something inside of him ruptured. He\u0027s bleeding. They need to remove or repair the damage as soon as possible.\"\n She grabbed a needle and some thread and I fought against the sudden acidic bile in my throat. \"Is he going to die?\" The tears in my eyes spilled down my cheeks. It couldn\u0027t end like this.\n The nurse didn\u0027t answer me right away, and when she did, her voice was professional and courteous. \"We have the best doctors in the country here. He\u0027s in good hands.\" I knew she was giving me a stock answer. I wanted a real one.\n Jerking my head up, I glared at her. \"That\u0027s not an answer.\"\n Turning my head back into position, she told me, \"I know, but it\u0027s the only one I have for you.\" Her words were gentle and kind, but firm, and I understood: My question wasn\u0027t answerable.\n They ran some tests on me after my head was sewn back together-X-rays, an MRI. They gave me a cold pack for the strain in my shoulder and told me to ice it twenty minutes every hour. Other than feeling sore and achy and having a headache, I felt fine, and I told them that repeatedly. When all of the tests backed up what I was saying, the hospital finally released me.\n After filling out my paperwork, I shuffled out to the emergency room lobby to wait for news on Kellan. Nobody had been able to tell me anything yet. It was a busy day in the ER, and as I scanned the crowd, I wondered how many poor souls had had their lives altered today. Like me. Tears filled my eyes, but I held them back. I didn\u0027t have time to break down, and I didn\u0027t need to. Kellan was going to be fine.\n My purse was strapped around my chest. It had miraculously remained attached to me throughout the entire accident. Setting down my cold compress, I dug through my bag for my cell phone. Hopefully it had also survived and still worked. I needed to be doing something. I needed to be active. If I stopped, even just for a second, I\u0027d start to think, and I didn\u0027t want to think. I didn\u0027t want to worry.\n Thankfully, the phone was intact. Scrolling through the list of people that mattered to me, I wondered who to call first when I heard somebody shout at the top of their lungs, \"Kiera!\"\n I looked up and scoured the patients until I found the person who had yelled for me. Eyes wide and bloodshot, my sister was running across the lobby to get to me; Griffin and Evan were right behind her. Anna engulfed me in a hug that knocked me back a step. It hurt, but I didn\u0027t care. I tossed my arms around and hugged her back just as hard. \"Anna,\" I croaked, trying not to sob.\n Smoothing my hair, she whispered, \"You\u0027re okay, you\u0027re okay, thank God you\u0027re okay.\" Pulling back, she cupped my cheeks. \"Do not ever scare me like that again, you hear me?\"\n I nodded as I fought back tears. Griffin and Evan stepped up to us. I looked around for Matt, but I didn\u0027t see him anywhere. Both boys looked pale, somber. Griffin looked a little green as he held Gibson tight to his chest. \"They won\u0027t tell us anything. Do you know what\u0027s happening to Kellan? Is he gonna be okay?\" he asked, his voice breaking.\n Stepping apart from Anna, I swallowed three times so I could speak. \"He\u0027s still in surgery.\" Plastering on a fake smile, I added, \"But he\u0027ll be fine.\"\n Anna rubbed my back, \"Kiera, I saw the accident on the Internet. The reporters caught every second of it.\"\n Blinking away the collecting moisture in my eyes, I locked gazes with her. \"He\u0027ll be fine,\" I reiterated.\n Eyes shimmering, Griffin stared down at his daughter. Evan enclosed me in a warm hug. When he pulled back, I scrunched my brows; it felt weird with my partially numb head. \"Where\u0027s Matt? Isn\u0027t he here?\"\n Griffin sniffed, then looked toward a set of automatic doors. \"He\u0027s still outside. He said he needed to make some calls before he came in here . . .\"\n Giving Evan one last squeeze, I looked over to the doors. Sure enough, in the distance, I could see Matt pacing back and forth. He looked troubled, but that was to be expected. \"I\u0027m going to go let him know about Kellan.\"\n Everyone nodded at me. Anna cuddled into Griffin\u0027s side. For once, the way the pair embraced each other was heartwarming and spoke volumes about how much they really did love each other. The way they looked at each other said even more. Turning from them, I made my way to Matt. He had to be just as worried as his band mates.\n Halfway to the doors, the phone I was still clutching in my hand rang. Relief mixed with pain when I saw who was calling me. \"Denny, I\u0027m so glad you called, I-\"\n He cut me off. \"I saw the accident on the news. Are you okay?\"\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n Denny let out a long, relieved exhale. \"I was so worried. The footage is scary as hell, they won\u0027t even show all of it on TV. God, I am so happy to hear your voice.\"\n I closed my eyes as I walked through the doors that led to where Matt was still walking back and forth. \"I\u0027m fine, but Kellan-\"\n Denny\u0027s voice was so quiet, I almost didn\u0027t hear him over the hum of the doors. \"Please tell me he\u0027s okay.\"\n I pressed my lips tight together. God, I hated saying it. I hated thinking it. I hated everything about this moment. \"He\u0027s in surgery. They aren\u0027t sure . . .\"\n \"Jesus. Kiera . . . I\u0027m . . . I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n Even though we were in the middle of New York City, it was quiet outside the hospital. Peaceful. I could hear everything going on around me-cars driving past, a couple talking as they walked down the sidewalk, a siren in the distance, and Denny sniffling in my ear. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be fine, Kiera.\" By the pain in his voice, I could tell that, regardless of what had happened between them, Denny was genuinely concerned for his longtime friend.\n I leaned against a column supporting the overhang to the ER entrance. Matt stopped pacing and stared at me. The terror in his eyes matched the horror in my heart. \"He has to be,\" I whispered. I couldn\u0027t picture my life without him.\n I hung up with Denny after telling him that I\u0027d call him the minute I had any news on Kellan. When I tucked the phone back in my purse, Matt approached me. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re okay, Kiera. That was the scariest shit I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\n Walking over to him, I nodded. He had his cell phone in his hand, and he was squeezing it so tight, his fingers were bloodless. Placing my hand over his, I attempted to relax his death grip on the device. \"Who were you calling?\"\n He stared at the doors over my shoulder. \"My parents, Rachel . . .\" When his gaze returned to mine, his pale eyes were glossy. \"I\u0027m scared to go in there,\" he whispered.\n \"I am, too,\" I told him. Successfully dislodging his cell phone, I grabbed his hand. It tightened around mine like a vice, like I was the only thing keeping him upright. \"We\u0027ll go in together, okay?\"\n Looking like a lost little boy who had finally found someone to guide him home, Matt nodded at me. Together, we walked into the hospital to await Kellan\u0027s fate.\n Deacon and the rest of the boys from Holeshot were waiting back inside the ER, as was Taskmaster Tory and some of the crew members. They all looked just as worried as we were. While everyone settled into a comfortable place to wait, I called everyone I could think of-Jenny, Cheyenne, Kate, my parents, Kellan\u0027s dad. Most of them had already heard the news by this point, but talking to them gave me something to do besides worrying about Kellan.\n When I had exhausted the contact list in my phone, Anna pulled me into a bathroom to clean me up; I was still a blood-covered mess. She washed my face and my hands and tore off one of her layered long-sleeved T-shirts. It was a maternity shirt and way too big for me, but it effectively hid the blood splattered across my top. Still ripe with emotion, Anna lightly kissed the bandage on my head. \"I never want to see your head wrapped in gauze again,\" she told me.\n Looking at myself in the mirror, I nodded in agreement. \"Me either.\"\n \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re okay.\" Starting to lose it, she brought her hands to her face.\n Knowing she needed to cry, I held her tight and let her. I stopped myself from crying along with her, though. There was no need. Kellan was fine.\n When we got back to the waiting room, I noticed people staring out the window, pointing and whispering. I didn\u0027t really care what they were finding so interesting, I just wanted news on Kellan. But Deacon was with them and he motioned me over. \"You gotta see this, Kiera.\"\n Feeling stiff, sore, tired, and drained, I shuffled over to the wall of windows where people were gathering. Not knowing what to expect, I peeked outside. It was almost lunchtime, and there was a group of people across the street, leaning against a low wall by a parking lot. They looked like they were having a picnic. Fascinating. I was about to ask what the big deal was when I noticed the shirts under their jackets. They were all wearing D-Bags shirts, and the opaque cups they were holding as they stood in a line on the sidewalk weren\u0027t holding beverages, they had small candlesticks inserted through them that gave the cups a cheery glow on this dreary day. My heart swelled at the sight of even more people loving Kellan. He wouldn\u0027t believe this.\n I knew the answer, but I had to ask the question anyway. \"Are they here for Kellan?\"\n Deacon smiled as he stared at the growing crowd. \"Yes.\"\n Warmth filled me as I watched this silent vigil for Kellan. I could almost feel the healing, positive energy flowing from them. Kellan needed to see this. He needed to see how much he was cared about, how much he was loved.\n \"Mrs. Kyle?\"\n I turned around to see a woman with a stethoscope around her neck standing behind me. She was looking at every person in the waiting room, her face neutral. I didn\u0027t know what that face meant. This wasn\u0027t the doctor who had been with Kellan in the ER. I didn\u0027t know who she was or what she wanted. I\u0027d already filled out the paperwork for both Kellan and myself with the nurse, so she had to be here to tell me about Kellan, about whether he was alive . . . or not. Why couldn\u0027t she smile, give me some ray of hope? My chest felt tight. Breathing was impossible. Stepping toward her, I nodded and raised my hand; it was all I could do.\n Approaching me, she calmly said, \"Your husband is out of surgery. Everything went well, and he\u0027s recovering in a room upstairs if you\u0027d like to go see him.\"\n My knees gave way, but Deacon caught me. \"He\u0027s fine? You\u0027re sure he\u0027s fine?\" I choked out.\n The doctor finally smiled. \"His spleen ruptured in the accident, which can be very dangerous, but my colleague and I were able to repair the tear and save the organ. He also bruised his hip, fractured a few ribs, and he\u0027ll be sore for a long time, but he was very lucky. I\u0027ve seen much worse. He\u0027ll need to stay here for a few days so we can watch for complications, and then he\u0027ll need lots of rest . . .\"\n She kept speaking but I didn\u0027t hear a word of it. He was alive.\n The assemblage waiting to see Kellan headed upstairs. Once we got to the nurse\u0027s station, a tall woman with her hair pulled back into a tight bun stopped our group. \"Who are you here for?\" she asked, eyeing our motley crew.\n I looked behind me at the various band members and roadies. I could only imagine who the nurse thought we all were. Turning back to her, I spoke in a shaky, excited voice. \"I\u0027m here to see my husband, Kellan Kyle.\"\n A small smile crept into her mouth, and I could tell she recognized his name. \"Oh, yes, well he\u0027s still recovering so only one of you-\"\n I stepped forward, not letting her finish. \"I need to see my husband, please.\"\n She indicated with her head for me to follow her. While we walked down the crisp white halls, the nurse looked me over. \"We\u0027ve had a few celebrities over the years, but none quite as big as Kellan Kyle. Half of the girls on the floor are in an absolute tizzy that he\u0027s here. So, you\u0027re really his wife?\"\n My eyes were frantically scouring the names on all the doors we were passing. Where was he? \"Yes,\" I told her, only half-listening.\n \"Oh,\" she said, sounding surprised. \"All that hoopla with Sienna Sexton must have been really hard on the two of you.\"\n I looked up at her. She seemed youthful, but the crinkles around her eyes and mouth suggested that she was older than she appeared. The smile she was giving me was full of sympathy. \"You have no idea.\" I gave her a wry smile.\n She held her hand out to me. \"My name is Carly. If you need anything, you just let me know.\"\n I gave her hand a quick shake. \"Thank you, I really appreciate that.\" I had a feeling I would definitely need her help while we were here.\n I knew the minute we were at Kellan\u0027s room. I knew it because a swarm of young nurses were hovering at the open door, glancing inside. The smile on Carly\u0027s face vanished as she scowled at the girls. \"If you all have nothing to do, I\u0027m sure I could find something for you.\"\n Tittering, the girls scampered off. Carly sighed as she indicated his door. \"Like I said, we haven\u0027t had anyone quite like Kellan here.\"\n A nervous laugh escaped me as I stepped into Kellan\u0027s private room. Leaving us alone, Carly closed the door as she left. The lights were low, the shades drawn. It was solemn and quiet. Kellan\u0027s eyes were closed and his head was angled away from me. The top of the bed was elevated some, so he was propped up, and the covers were tucked under his arms. His hands rested at his sides in an almost unnatural way. An IV pierced through the back of his left hand, pumped him full of medication and painkillers. His ring was missing; they must have removed it before the surgery.\n Kellan was tall and well-built, but he looked tiny as he lay in the bed. The sight made my eyes sting.\n The expression on his face was so peaceful as he slept that I almost wanted to stay where I was so that I didn\u0027t unintentionally disturb him. I couldn\u0027t stay that far away, though. Quiet as a mouse, I walked to his side. He had small cuts on his face, but other than that he looked perfect. He was wearing a hospital gown, the embarrassing kind that ties in the back, and a bag of his belongings was sitting on the nightstand next to the bed.\n Careful to not hurt him, I sat on the edge of his mattress. I was a little scared to touch him, but I needed to, so I gingerly wrapped my fingers over his arm. He was warm. \"Kellan,\" I whispered, \"are you awake?\" His head moved, but he didn\u0027t answer me. I ran my fingers down his arm, cupping his hand. \"I\u0027m right here, waiting for you.\" Tears clouding my vision, I ran a knuckle down his cheek. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere, baby.\"\n Minutes ticked by as I waited for whatever drugs they\u0027d used to knock him out with to wear off enough that he\u0027d wake up. It felt like it took forever, and a little bit of guilt crept into me that the others couldn\u0027t see him yet. But I needed to be there when he woke up. I just . . . needed it.\n I could tell when he was starting to come around. His eyes moved beneath his lids. Then he inhaled a deep breath and cringed on the exhale. I hoped he didn\u0027t wake up in too much pain. When he finally opened his eyes, I thought my face might split apart I was smiling so hard. \"Kellan, baby?\"\n He didn\u0027t look my way, just slowly blinked and stared at nothing. He had to be confused. I wondered if he even remembered the accident. Tenderly, I stroked his cheek again. \"Kellan?\"\n He finally turned my way, his expression blank. As his midnight eyes searched my face, I began to get the horrid feeling in my gut that he wouldn\u0027t remember me. The doctor hadn\u0027t mentioned a head injury, but what if he\u0027d struck the concrete too? What if he had amnesia? God, would he still love me if we had to start over?\n Kellan worked his mouth, then swallowed a few times. Forehead wrinkling, he said, \"Kiera? What happened?\"\n Relief and amusement flooded through me. Of course he still remembered me. \"I got pushed into the street. You raced out to help me, and a truck hit you. You\u0027re in the hospital.\"\n Kellan\u0027s eyes fixed on the bandage at the edge of my hairline. \"Are you okay?\" he asked.\n Shaking my head that he was still more worried about me, I leaned down and gave him a soft kiss. \"You\u0027re alive. I\u0027m perfect.\"\n Closing his eyes, Kellan looked pained as he breathed shallowly through his mouth. \"I don\u0027t feel good.\"\n I smoothed back his hair. \"I know. They had to operate on you because your spleen ruptured. They were able to save it, but you\u0027re going to be sore for a while.\"\n Kellan cracked an eye open, and a ghost of a smile crept into his lips. \"Oh, good, I\u0027d hate to be spleenless.\" He closed his eyes again. \"What the hell does a spleen do anyway?\"\n A small laugh escaped me. His sense of humor was definitely still intact. \"From what I remember in school, it\u0027s like the oil filter of your immune system . . . and it was once thought to be the source of anger. I\u0027m not sure about that one though.\"\n Kellan started to chuckle, then froze. \"Oh, don\u0027t make me laugh.\"\n I kissed his cheek. \"I won\u0027t. We\u0027ll never laugh again, I promise.\"\n Opening his eyes, he chuckled again, then cringed. \"I said don\u0027t make me laugh.\"\n Resting my head against his, I whispered, \"I love you so much. I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re okay.\"\n Kellan tried to pull me into a hug, but he was so weak and so sore. I didn\u0027t want him hurting himself, so I stilled his hands and crawled into the bed with him. Carefully draping my arm over his upper chest, I gently squeezed the top of his shoulders. He sighed in relief. \"I love you too.\"\n Tears rolled down my cheeks as what nearly happened today crashed into me. I kissed his head as I held him tight. \"You saved my life,\" I whispered, my voice warbling.\n His words thick with sleep, he told me, \"I was returning the favor.\"\n He started to doze off again, and I thought to leave so others could see him. His hand on my back tightened when he felt me move away. \"It\u0027s okay, I was just going to let the others come see you. They\u0027re all so worried.\"\n \"Stay . . . just . . . for a minute,\" he mumbled.\n I kissed his shoulder. \"As long as you want, Kellan. As long as you want.\"\n He dozed off again after a few minutes. Knowing others needed to see him, I carefully climbed out of his bed. He stirred but didn\u0027t open his eyes. When I got back to the waiting room, a surprise was waiting for me. Justin was there, talking to Evan. The nurses who had been hovering by Kellan\u0027s room were openly gaping at the new rock star who had dropped into their midst. I figured this day would live on in infamy for them. For me too, I supposed.\n Touched that Justin was there, I immediately threw my arms around him. \"Justin, thank you for coming. This will mean so much to Kellan.\"\n Justin patted my back in a friendly squeeze. \"Our tour was close by. When I heard the news, I had to. Is he okay?\"\n I nodded as I stepped back. \"Yeah. Groggy, but okay.\" I looked around the band members. \"You guys can see him now.\"\n Matt, Evan, and Griffin all looked at each other. The nurse had said one person could go in at a time; they were trying to decide who should go in first. Shrugging, Matt stuck his hands out with his fist on his palm. \"Rock Paper Scissors?\"\n Griffin rolled his eyes. \"We\u0027re fucking rock stars. When did we start caring about rules?\"\n Still carrying Gibson, Griffin strode toward the room I\u0027d just left. Matt and Evan glanced at each other, then followed him. Giggling, Anna hurried after her husband. I watched the crowd descending on Kellan, then motioned for Justin and Holeshot to come with me, and we all followed the D-Bags. One for all and all for one.\n Kellan was more like himself as the afternoon wore on. He was tired and in pain, but mostly in good spirits. Tory left soon after checking on Kellan; she said she was immediately going to issue a statement to the public that \"It was touch and go, but Kellan narrowly escaped Death\u0027s dark call, and he is slowly recuperating from his nearly tragic accident.\" I thought her story was a little dramatic, but by the glow in her eyes, I could tell that framing it that way was excellent publicity. I found it really interesting that we couldn\u0027t get her to lift a finger for us when we needed her to, but she was all over it when it benefitted the label.\n Rock stars and roadies loitered around Kellan\u0027s room as he recovered, much to the delight of the nurses who popped in every five minutes. The doctors and the head nurse, Carly, were less happy about Kellan\u0027s numerous guests, and eventually made everyone leave Kellan\u0027s room but me. Since Holeshot and the tour crew members had to go get ready for the show tonight anyway, they said their goodbyes and grudgingly left the hospital. Justin stayed, since his band wasn\u0027t playing, but he gave Kellan and me some privacy by hanging out in the lobby with Anna and the other D-Bags.\n When the sky began to darken, I wandered over to the window to peek outside. I\u0027d heard from the nurses that the crowd of fans outside had swelled considerably since earlier today. As I started to peer through the blinds, Kellan asked, \"Have you heard from Sienna? She didn\u0027t come by. I\u0027m kind of surprised by that.\"\n I looked back at him in bed. He was sitting up higher with fluffy pillows shoved behind his back, but still at an angle that was comfortable for his stomach. There was a tray of uneaten food hovering over his lap, and he was frowning as he poked at a cup of Jell-O with a plastic spoon.\n \"I\u0027m kind of surprised by that too,\" I answered. It wasn\u0027t like Sienna to miss a photo op, and her rushing to the side of her fallen colleague seemed like a missed opportunity to me. Even if Kellan and I had come clean about our relationship and no one believed that they were dating-and I was really hoping that was the case now-visiting Kellan at the hospital would still make her look good. And after what we\u0027d said about her, she probably needed a little positive PR.\n \"She sent flowers.\" I pointed over to a modest floral arrangement that was resting between an elegant bouquet of lilies from Lana, and a monstrous vase overflowing with cloyingly powerful red roses from Nick. All the card attached to Sienna\u0027s said was, \"I\u0027m so sorry. S.\"\n Kellan glanced at them, then frowned at me. \"A subtle get-well bouquet isn\u0027t exactly her style. I was expecting her to hand deliver them to me in a sequined, floor-length gown.\"\n I smirked at him. Yeah, something that outrageous that demanded people paid attention was much more Sienna\u0027s style than being virtually silent with anonymously delivered flowers. Shaking my head since I didn\u0027t understand it, I turned back to the window and pried open the slits. The sun had set not too long ago and it wasn\u0027t fully dark yet, but I could easily see the many pinpoints of lights as fans crowded around the hospital with cups of glowing candles. My throat was thick at the display of love before me. \"Kellan,\" I whispered, \"you have to see this.\"\n I knew he wouldn\u0027t be up to standing yet, so I raised the blinds in a hope that he could see the lights from his bed. Since he was only a foot or two away, he had a pretty good view. I watched his face as he dropped his spoon to his tray. \"What is that?\"\n \"Those are your fans. They\u0027re here for you.\" I waved at the fans. Since the light was on in Kellan\u0027s room and it was dark outside, I knew they had a full shot of me. I wasn\u0027t sure how they\u0027d react to seeing me here, but surprisingly the candles started moving in unison, like they were waving back at me. I took that as a good sign.\n Kellan looked up at me, mystified. \"That\u0027s for me?\"\n Walking over to his bed, I sat on the corner and ran my hand through his hair. \"You\u0027re very loved. And not just because of what you are. Your fans see you. Through your music, they see you. And they love you.\" I cupped his perfect, right-angled jaw, and stroked his cheek with my thumb. \"It\u0027s not just this that they love, you know? It\u0027s you.\"\n Leaning down, I kissed his forehead.\n I looked up when I heard a light tap at the door. When I saw the group of people who were watching us, I thought I was going to start sobbing. Standing just inside of the doorframe were my mother and father, and Kellan\u0027s father, Gavin. Hailey and Riley were peeking into the room from behind their dad. I was so surprised, I was at a loss for words. I had just talked with each of them a few hours ago, and none of them had mentioned hopping a plane and flying out here.\n Kellan was just as much at a loss as I was. \"Gavin, Caroline . . . Martin? What are you doing in New York?\"\n Gavin approached his son; the worry on his face was as clear as day to me. It warmed my heart. Even if he\u0027d kept his distance for most of Kellan\u0027s life, he really did love him. \"I\u0027m sorry we\u0027re so late. We got on the first flight we could.\" Standing beside Kellan, Gavin put a hand on his shoulder. \"We were all so incredibly worried about you.\"\n Hailey and Riley came up to stand at the end of the bed while Kellan\u0027s eyes teared up. \"You were worried about . . . me?\" He still seemed stunned that they would care.\n Gavin\u0027s face softened into a smile. \"Of course I was, son. When I heard you were in an accident, I was terrified.\"\n Reaching down, Hailey rubbed his foot through the blanket. \"We love you, bro.\" Riley nodded in agreement.\n While Kellan swallowed back both physical and emotional pain, my parents stepped up to the bed. My mom was cradling Gibson to her chest, but reached over and put her hand on Kellan\u0027s leg. \"We came as soon as we could too.\" Her green eyes flashed to mine. \"You\u0027re family, Kellan.\"\n Kellan turned to me, and I could see the pain and joy in his eyes. This is what he\u0027d always wanted. Family. A real family. I couldn\u0027t contain it anymore, and big fat tears started rolling down my cheeks. Dad looked like he was suddenly worried about my health as he stared at me. Mom simply walked around and gave me a knowing hug. Having my family fully accept my husband was the greatest gift they could have ever given me, and him.\n When I calmed down, Kellan relaxed back into his cushions. Even though he cringed in discomfort, he was smiling at me. \"So adorable,\" he muttered.\n Ignoring him, I watched my mom as she kissed Gibson\u0027s nose. \"How is it you are all here together?\"\n Dad frowned as he gave Mom a pointed glance. \"Your mother spotted Gavin in baggage claim . . . from clear across the room.\"\n Ignoring him, Mom cooed at her granddaughter. I stifled a laugh. Yeah, like Kellan, Gavin stood out in a crowd.\n As it grew late into the evening, I thought about the concert going on, and all the fans who would be disheartened that Kellan and the D-Bags weren\u0027t playing. But they couldn\u0027t play without their lead singer, and he was in no shape to be on stage. I was a little surprised that Sienna hadn\u0027t played up her distress over the accident by rescheduling the show. Everything about what she\u0027d done today was surprising me.\n I think my mom wanted to stay by Kellan\u0027s side all night, baby Gibson in hand, but I could see how tired she was, and I made the D-Bags take her and Dad back to the hotel. She promised to come back first thing in the morning. I didn\u0027t doubt she would.\n Collecting her daughter from Mom, Anna asked me, \"Are you coming with us back to the hotel?\" I could tell from her tone of voice that she already knew my answer. I shook my head. No, I wasn\u0027t leaving Kellan\u0027s side. They\u0027d have to drag me outside to get me to leave.\n Justin and the D-Bags headed out with Anna and our parents. Gavin and his children went with them. The room felt a little bigger with everyone\u0027s energy gone, but the level of love inside it didn\u0027t lower at all. I gazed at Kellan for long minutes, just wanting time to stand still. Eyes heavy with drugs, pain, and sleep, Kellan stared right back at me. Then his face contorted into a strange expression. \"Crap,\" he whispered. \"I have to pee.\" He looked over to the bathroom and sighed, like it was so far away it may as well have been in another country.\n Chuckling at him, I kissed his cheek. \"I could help you?\"\n He pursed his lips. \"Uh, no, I got it. I can do this.\" He let out a low, steady exhale. \"The nurse said I should get up and move around anyway.\"\n He leaned forward to stand and I placed my hands on his back in support. \"She said tomorrow you should.\"\n Kellan bit his lip as he tried to suppress a groan. It didn\u0027t work, and he let out a low rumble of pain. \"It\u0027s just a couple of hours shy of tomorrow,\" he said through clenched teeth.\n As he uncovered himself from the sheets, I hurried around to the other side of the bed, bringing the IV stand with me. Once he stood up, he gasped and clenched at the pole for support. I held it still so he wouldn\u0027t fall over. Pale and looking a little ill, he glanced out the window. His mouth dropped open as he got a clear view of the sea of candlelight in the darkness. \"Oh my God, Kiera. They\u0027re still here.\"\n Patting his hand on the pole, I urged him forward. \"Of course they are.\"\n Kellan seemed to forget about his pain until he took a step. Then he groaned and gingerly held his stomach. Feeling bad that I couldn\u0027t do anything for him, I merely held the bathroom door open. His face was tight as he passed by me. \"Thanks.\"\n Before I closed the door behind him, I couldn\u0027t help but check out the toned sections of skin showing between the ties along the back of his gown. Only Kellan Kyle could make a hospital gown sexy. Kellan started to chuckle when he noticed me watching; he instantly grimaced. \"Stop making me laugh and close the door.\"\n Letting out a hearty laugh, since he couldn\u0027t, I did what he asked. While I waited for him and hoped he didn\u0027t get light-headed and pass out, I meandered over to the window to watch the crowd of well-wishers. They were stretched along the sidewalk across from the hospital, almost as far as I could see; it really was an impressive sight.\n A short knock followed by a polite voice disrupted my thoughts. \"Mrs. Kyle, I\u0027m sorry to bother you. It\u0027s after hours, but your brother is here?\"\n I turned to see the night nurse poking her head through the partially open door. I kept my face purposely neutral. Brother? I didn\u0027t have a brother. The nurse looked behind her, then back at me. \"Normally, I\u0027d make him wait until morning, but he says he flew across the country to see you?\"\n She looked at me skeptically, like she was sure the person behind her was not who he claimed to be. And she was right; he wasn\u0027t who he said he was. I let the surprise I felt show on my face. \"Denny? Denny\u0027s here?\"\n The nurse seemed relieved and opened the door a bit wider. \"I\u0027ll let him come in, but just for a few minutes, okay?\"\n I nodded, still absolutely stunned that he\u0027d come all this way. The nurse stepped back and made a motion with her hand while opening the door wide with her other one. Denny stepped into the room, looking worn and weary. Abby followed a step behind him. Even more surprise trickled through me at seeing Denny\u0027s fiancee.\n Respectfully, Denny turned to the nurse and told her, \"Thank you for your help, Renae.\" For the millionth time today, I was shocked; he\u0027d said that without any trace of an accent. Nothing.\n Once she was gone, Denny turned back to me. I must have still looked shocked, because he started laughing. His accent back in place, he told me, \"I couldn\u0027t be your brother if I didn\u0027t sound like you, and I wanted to make sure they let me in.\" My favorite grin formed on his lips. \"And faking an American accent is not easy. I was positive she was going to see right through me.\"\n Giggling, I rushed over to him and tossed my arms around him. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re here.\"\n Sighing, Denny held me tight. \"I\u0027m only sorry I\u0027m late.\"\n The bathroom door swung open as Denny and I pulled apart. Kellan had a small smile on his face that fell when he noticed Denny. The same shock I\u0027d felt flitted over Kellan\u0027s features as he wobbled a bit. He didn\u0027t seem angry, just massively surprised. Tilting his head, he asked, \"Are you a figment of my pain meds? Or are you really standing right in front of me?\"\n \"I\u0027m really here. It\u0027s good to see you in one piece, mate.\" Smiling, Denny walked over and gave Kellan a quick hug. It was pretty easy to see that Kellan was quickly losing strength.\n As Denny helped him get back into bed, Kellan looked between Denny and Abby and stammered, \"You\u0027re here? You both came all the way over here? For me?\"\n Once Kellan was lying down, Denny sighed and ran a hand through his hair. \"Yeah, we came here for you.\" He glanced at Abby, then turned back to Kellan. \"It scared the piss outta me, when I found out you were hurt. All I could think was that . . .\" Swallowing, Denny looked away.\n Realizing this moment had nothing to do with me, I stayed against the wall and tried to be inconspicuous. Abby moved beside me and gave me a soft smile as she patted my hand. I could tell by the look on her face that she was silently acknowledging all of the pain I\u0027d gone through today, and offering me her support and friendship. I clasped her hand, grateful, and then the both of us turned to watch our fiances.\n When Denny could continue, he told Kellan, \"We used to be close. We used to be like brothers. And if you died . . . it would be like a part of my family had died. And I don\u0027t think you realize that.\" His eyes returned to Kellan\u0027s. \"I hate the idea of you dying without knowing how much I . . .\" Closing his mouth, he sniffed, then said, \"I don\u0027t know, I feel like, maybe I haven\u0027t been the greatest friend to you.\"\n \"Denny-\"\n Kellan tried to interrupt him, but Denny wouldn\u0027t let him.\"I knew what was going on, Kellan, with you and your dad, and I didn\u0027t say anything to anybody. I didn\u0027t help you like I should have.\"\n \"You were a kid,\" Kellan muttered.\n \"So were you,\" he retorted. \"And when I moved away, I didn\u0027t keep in touch like I promised.\" Clearly angry at himself, Denny shook his head. \"You needed me, and I wasn\u0027t there for you. And I\u0027m really sorry. That was pretty shitty of me.\"\n \"Are you kidding?\" Incredulous, Kellan pointed over at me. \"I slept with your girlfriend . . . repeatedly.\" I flinched, and Abby squeezed my hand a little tighter.\n Denny frowned. \"Well, that was pretty shitty of you.\" A sad smile darkened his features. \"But I left you alone in hell . . . and I almost think that was worse.\" He stuck his hand out to Kellan. \"I know we\u0027ve already put the past behind us, and I know we\u0027re friends, but I want you to know, without a doubt in your head, that we\u0027re still brothers. You understand me?\"\n Kellan still seemed shocked to his core, but he nodded and shook Denny\u0027s hand. \"Yeah, yeah, okay.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reckless-thoughtless-3/page-27.html","bookId":1885,"book":{"id":1885,"title":"Reckless (Thoughtless #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Reckless (Thoughtless #3) \n When the band hits it big, Kiera and Kellan must ask themselves: Can their love for each other survive the constant pressures of superstardom?
