{"id":84091,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"The release date of the album was set for the thirteenth of September. The first single was going to be the song they recorded with Sienna. There was already a huge buzz about it, especially once word got out that the mysterious man in the photograph was the lead singer of the band featured on Sienna\u0027s new song. I wasn\u0027t sure how it happened, but the tabloids figured out who Kellan was and ran with the story of two young musicians falling in love while recording their duet. Rumors of their relationship popped up everywhere. Now that it had been brought to my attention, I couldn\u0027t seem to escape it-TV, grocery store magazine racks, the radio. I\u0027d seen or heard about the damn photo fifty million times already. Okay, it was an attractive photo. They\u0027d captured the moment right when Kellan had been politely smiling down at Sienna, and she was smiling back up at him. I couldn\u0027t successfully pull off a profile shot, but Kellan and Sienna looked just as good from the side as they did straight on; it really wasn\u0027t fair. For some reason, everyone was excited about this imaginary blossoming romance. And everyone was eager to hear what sound these two impossibly attractive people would produce, which instantly made me think that the label was the one that leaked Kellan\u0027s name. Hell, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if they\u0027d been the ones to tell the photographers where we\u0027d been going to dinner that night. Anything to drive up interest. Kellan had tried his best to squelch the rumors. After the photo shoot, he\u0027d called Sienna on the drive home. It floored me that Kellan had Sienna Sexton\u0027s number in his cell phone. Weird. Even weirder, Sienna had Kellan\u0027s name in her phone; she instantly knew who he was when he called her. \"Hi, Sienna, this is Kell-\" He paused. \"Yeah, it\u0027s me. Hi.\" While he laughed, I tried in vain to hear her side of the conversation. All I got was Kellan\u0027s, though. \"Have you seen that photo of us? Yeah, that one. Have you said anything yet? Made a statement or something?\" He frowned as he listened. \"People are linking us . . . romantically.\" His brows drew together. \"Well, I think it\u0027s a big deal.\" He splayed his hand like she was in front of him. \"Because I\u0027m married, and I don\u0027t want this perception out there that you and I are-\" Kellan glanced over at me and shook his head. \"No, not officially, but we still consider ourselves husband and-\" His frown returning, he swung his eyes back to the road. \"Look, can you just say that we\u0027re only working together, and our relationship is purely professional?\" He smiled. \"Okay, thank you.\" Once he hung up, he told me, \"She said she\u0027d take care of it.\" \"And you think that she will?\" He looked over at me, his sunglasses hiding his expression. \"Of course. Why wouldn\u0027t she?\" I didn\u0027t want to tell him, but we\u0027d agreed to honesty, so, sighing, I did. \"Because I think she\u0027s interested in you. Because I think she wants the two of you to be linked. Because I think it creates a stronger buzz for the single if the two of you are together. And because I think she is very good at manipulating public perception to get what she wants.\" Kellan was silent after I said that, which made me think he, at least in part, agreed. After a long moment he said, \"And you think what she wants . . . is me?\" Leaning my head back on the seat, I closed my eyes. Who wouldn\u0027t want you? Surprising me, Sienna did release a statement shortly after Kellan\u0027s phone call, explaining that she was currently single and loving it, and that the man in question was \"Merely a close friend who is working on a project with me that the fans are going to love!\" While she\u0027d done what Kellan asked, I wasn\u0027t sure if that explanation helped anything or not. No one seemed to believe that \"close friend\" really meant \"close friend.\" They all assumed it was code for \"we don\u0027t want to announce our relationship yet.\" It certainly fueled the hype for the single. I\u0027d known Kellan\u0027s first album would be exciting, but I had no idea there\u0027d be so much energy around the release, energy fueled by rumors and speculation about Kellan and Sienna\u0027s personal life. Jenny, Kate, and Cheyenne listened to my concerns with sympathetic ears. My sister told me not to worry about it. When I\u0027d asked her if she\u0027d seen the photo yet, she told me, \"That? Oh, yeah, I saw it a week or so after I got back. Kellan looks superhot in that pic, by the way!\" She sighed. \"Too bad he\u0027s not turned more toward the camera. They really should have waited to get an exit shot.\" Remembering that Thing 1 had cleared the sidewalk before we left the restaurant, I snapped, \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me the minute you saw it?\" Anna let out a long, low exhale. \"Because I knew you\u0027d freak out, and I knew the picture was nothing.\" \"They\u0027re linking them as a couple, Anna.\" Lying on my bed, I stared at the chandelier above my head. \"That\u0027s not nothing.\" \"Yes, it is. What do you care what the public thinks? You and I both know that he\u0027s not with her. Hell, I was there the entire time that she was there, and I know for a fact that nothing happened between them. This isn\u0027t a big deal, Kiera.\" \"It\u0027s weird.\" Seeing a rose petal on Kellan\u0027s pillow, I held it up and rubbed the silky petal between my fingers. This one was a coral color, from a fresh bouquet the maid had placed in the hallway yesterday. Kellan had gone for a run earlier, and left the petal in bed for me. He\u0027d written the words Back soon on it. Anna sighed again, but more compassionately. \"It\u0027s only weird if you let it be weird. Don\u0027t get yourself tied up in knots over one harmless photograph. I mean, what\u0027s the worst that can happen?\" My sister was right, of course. But still, having the world at large hope for your husband to hook up with someone else was a little . . . heartbreaking. A few weeks before the album dropped, the boys were slated to set off on a whirlwind promotional tour. They were hitting all of the biggest cities in almost every state in the continental U.S. Looking at their schedule was mind-boggling. It was a nonstop jumble of plane rides, radio interviews, and private performances. There were times when they were booked for appearances in three different cities in one day. I was exhausted just staring at the itinerary. If we could get through this, touring should be easy. Their first stop on the promo tour was a popular radio station in Los Angeles. No, it wasn\u0027t just popular-it was the number one station in the city, and they were going to debut the single there while the boys were in the studio. My stomach was a swarm of butterflies. Even though I knew this song release was only going to fuel the flames of Kellan and Sienna\u0027s formulated relationship, I couldn\u0027t wait to hear Kellan\u0027s voice being broadcasted over the airwaves. It was such a surreal thought. Knowing life was going to get very hectic very soon, Kellan and I savored every moment of quiet togetherness that we could. Kellan gave me a tour of the city, showing me some of the dive bars he and the D-Bags had played at during their time here. I could easily picture a fresh-out-of-high-school Kellan wowing the panties off of wannabe Hollywood starlets. It must have been very easy for him to line up \"dates\" down here. Kellan showed me the touristy things too-Disneyland, Seaworld, the Walk of Fame-but my favorite moments were lounging by the pool at the record label\u0027s house. Especially when everyone else was gone and it was just the two of us. On a sunny mid-August morning, a few days before the chaotic part of Kellan\u0027s career kicked in, we were enjoying a private dip in the pool. I was leaning against the cool white steps that led down into the turquoise water, watching the tiny disruptive waves my legs made as I lightly kicked them in front of me. The smell of chlorine and sunblock filled my senses, and except for some birds squawking in a nearby tree, all was quiet. Knowing this peace wouldn\u0027t last, I savored it. Under the water, a dark shape approached me. Hands ran up my legs, stilling them, as the submerged body swam right over mine. Stopping at my waist, Kellan lifted his head out of the water and crooked a grin at me. \"Hey.\" \"Hey,\" I muttered, biting my lip. His hair was slicked back from his face, and beads of water rolled down his cheeks. The sunlight sparkled in his eyes, lightening the deep blue color. He was glorious, and for this one moment in time, he was all mine. Sighing, I sat up and wrapped my arms around his neck; my legs automatically tightened around his waist. He sank to his knees, holding me in his arms in the shallow water. If contentment could be felt as a physical thing, like the warmth from the sun or a cool breeze on a hot day, then surely I was feeling it wrap around me right now as I laid my head on his shoulder and let myself be consumed by his presence. Just as Kellan pulled back to look at me, the tranquility on his face matching mine, Griffin stepped out of the house. He walked over to the steps, frowned, and scratched his head, like he was trying to puzzle out how to do something. Then he shrugged and knocked on the railing that divided the steps. Struggling to keep his face straight, Kellan peeked up at him. \"Yes?\" \"That dude from the record is here. Wants to talk to you.\" Setting me down beside him, Kellan stood from the water. Rivulets ran down the lines and curves of his body. Beads of moisture were left in their wake; they clung to his skin like they were reluctant to leave him. I completely understood the feeling. \"Which dude?\" Kellan asked. Griffin shrugged, indiscretely checking me out. \"I don\u0027t know. The uppity one in a suit.\" Kellan stepped slightly in front of me. \"Nick? The vice president of the label?\" Griffin raised his gaze to Kellan. \"I don\u0027t know. Sure.\" Kellan glanced back at me. The last time the VP of the label showed up, it had been to offer Kellan a major opportunity. I had a feeling that whatever he wanted now would be just as big. For some reason, though, my stomach dropped. Quickly toweling off, Kellan threw on a shirt and I threw on some shorts. I\u0027d prefer to meet with a bigwig fully clothed and fully dry, but my tankini top and wet hair would have to do for now. Best not to keep the man who controlled my husband\u0027s destiny waiting. Griffin led us upstairs, to where we\u0027d met with Nick and Sienna last time. As I was about to follow Kellan into the room, Griffin grabbed my elbow. I instantly tensed as I looked up at his face. A frown on his lips, he said, \"Anna tells me you don\u0027t like me. That true? I thought we were cool.\" Wondering why on earth Griffin wanted to talk about this now, I gently pulled my arm from his grasp. \"We\u0027re . . . cool. Sure.\" Stay out of my bedroom, don\u0027t touch me again, and quit fooling around on my sister, and we\u0027re great. His pale eyes hardened as he tucked some hair behind his ears. \"You just totally lied.\" He folded his arms over his chest. \"I\u0027m not sleeping with you, so I don\u0027t really give a shit what you think about me, but I would like to know why you hate me, since I\u0027ve been nothing but nice to you.\" Nice? Is that what he\u0027s been to me? Stifling an eye roll, I glanced over Griffin\u0027s shoulder; I could see Kellan shaking hands with the \"uppity one in a suit,\" Nick. I really wanted to hear what was going on in there, not engage Griffin in a pointless conversation. As I avoided answering Griffin\u0027s question, he added, \"Is it because I said I wanted to get laid? Because I was totally kidding.\" My eyes involuntarily narrowed into slits as I looked back up at him. \"No, you weren\u0027t kidding. You\u0027re crude, obnoxious, and you\u0027re a bigger man whore than Kellan ever was!\" Griffin gave me a \"yeah, right\" face, which I forcefully made myself ignore. \"You represent everything I hate about rock stars. The partying, the women, the sex. You\u0027re everything that I\u0027m afraid Kellan will become!\" Griffin poked me in the shoulder. \"So your problem isn\u0027t really with me. You\u0027re afraid of what Kell might do when you\u0027re not around, so your problem is you.\" He spread his hands out. \"Anna\u0027s never asked me to not dick around. We\u0027ve never been exclusive. She doesn\u0027t care who I have sex with . . . so why should you?\" Raising his chin, he added, \"And I\u0027ll have you know, I\u0027ve only fucked about five people this year, and nobody since Anna told me she was knocked up. So, yeah, I do fucking care about her. I think I may even fucking love her.\" He spun around and stormed into the room after that, and I could only stare at him in shock. Did I just get schooled by Griffin? That had to be one of the signs of the apocalypse. But . . . he did have a point. I mainly disliked him because I didn\u0027t want Kellan to be like him. And Kellan wasn\u0027t like him. They were night-and-day different. Griffin was just so crass. But so was my sister, and I loved her to pieces. Well, crap. Now I had to make an actual attempt to like Griffin. And, wow, he just said he loved Anna. That blew my mind. I finally walked into the room, thinking that nothing Nick told me could shock me more than what Griffin had just said. Kellan was sitting on one of the couches across from Nick. Evan and Matt were sitting next to him, but there was just enough room for me. Feeling like I was completely disrupting the conversation, I walked in front of Matt and Evan to sit by Kellan. Griffin threw his weight down in a chair opposite us. Nick paused in his pleasantries to wait for me to settle myself into Kellan\u0027s side. My cheeks heated as the blond, blue-eyed man tapped his thumb on his crossed leg. Even though it had to be ninety degrees outside, Nick was in a full suit. And an expensive one at that-Armani probably. His tie was bright red, a power color. He seemed pretty young to be a VP, mid-thirties at best, so I figured he was confident and driven, a man who was used to getting his way. When I was situated, Nick gave me a brief smile. His calculating eyes took in my appearance, and he said, \"Making good use of the home\u0027s amenities, I see.\" His eyes shifted to Kellan. \"That\u0027s good. You\u0027ll need your rest now to get you through the launch.\" Kellan eyed me and nodded. Before anyone in the room could ask what Nick wanted, he told us,\"I have good news. Great news.\" Leaning forward, he clasped his fingers together. I noted the lack of a wedding ring. \"Diedrick Kraus just agreed to shoot the video for \u0027Regretfully.\u0027\" When no one said anything, Nick smiled. \"You have no idea who that is, do you?\" \"Sorry, no,\" Kellan told him. He waved off Kellan\u0027s apology. \"Diedrick Kraus is the genius behind some of the greatest music videos of our times. He\u0027s exclusive. Hard to come by. We gave him a sample of your song, and he wants to direct it.\" Nick clapped his hands together. \"No, he fucking insisted on it.\" I blinked at the use of profanity by such a high profile person, but Nick quickly moved on. Pointing at Kellan, he said, \"Diedrick\u0027s got a couple days available at the end of the month, Sienna\u0027s got a tiny break in her schedule, and we\u0027ll squeeze it in for you during the promotional tour.\" He lifted his hands to the sky. \"I swear the stars aligned for this.\" Kellan\u0027s mouth opened as he glanced at his band mates. \"We\u0027re making a music video?\" He looked back at Nick. \"Do people even still watch those?\" A small frown turned down the executive\u0027s lips before he righted them again. \"Yes, they do.\" His smile widening, he leaned forward so much I thought he might topple off of the couch. \"And we\u0027ve got an opportunity here to stir the hornet\u0027s nest.\" Confusion marred Kellan\u0027s features. \"I have no idea what that means.\" Nick shook his head. \"It means we\u0027re going to cause some serious buzz with this video. Ever since the public caught wind of you and Sienna in that photograph, there has been a firestorm of interest. Everyone is curious about Sienna\u0027s new man.\" \"I\u0027m not her man,\" Kellan interjected. Nick ignored him. \"We\u0027re going to fuel the flames of Kellan and Sienna madness, and ride the hype to the top of the charts.\" My heart sank as I looked at the eager expression on Nick\u0027s face. I wasn\u0027t sure what he meant by that, but I was sure I wasn\u0027t going to like it. His demeanor radiating caution, Kellan asked, \"What do you mean?\" Excitement on his face, Nick spread his fingers. \"We\u0027re going to play up the romantic portion of the song, make the video seriously hot. Naked bodies, deep kisses, moaning and groaning, whatever we can get away with.\" Winking at Kellan, he added, \"Anyone who watches it will immediately need to take a very cold shower. The buzz around you and Sienna is going to skyrocket.\" I wanted to stand up and tell this scheming moneybags that Kellan would be doing no such thing, but knowing it wasn\u0027t my place right now to say anything, I grit my jaw tight. Kellan\u0027s face went the opposite way; his mouth dropped open. \"The song is about a breakup,\" he sputtered, mystified. Nick nodded, steepling his fingers under his chin. \"Yes, and what great breakup didn\u0027t start off with a fiery romance?\" The room was silent for a moment. Evan and Matt were staring at me, making my cheeks heat. Griffin was ear-to-ear smiles. I wasn\u0027t sure if he was happy about filming the music video in general, or about watching Kellan film a scene with Sienna that would make him need \"to take a very cold shower.\" Probably a little of both. Finally, Kellan told Nick, \"I\u0027m married. I can\u0027t do that.\" Griffin volunteered immediately. \"I can!\" Ignoring Griffin\u0027s outburst, Nick gave Kellan a hard stare. The look on his face made goose bumps break out on my arms. Definitely a man who was used to getting his way. \"I\u0027m not asking you to have an affair with the woman. That part is entirely up to you.\" He smirked and flicked a quick glance at me. As I glowered, his eyes returned to Kellan\u0027s. \"I\u0027m merely asking you to film a fictional video with her to a song that you\u0027ve already recorded, a song that we own, by the way.\" He pointed at Kellan with laced fingers, and a chilly smile touched his lips. Leaning back, he placed his hands on his thighs like he was going to stand. \"Entertaining the masses is part of your job description, and sometimes that includes acting. If we\u0027d known you were . . . unwilling . . . to do that, we wouldn\u0027t have signed you.\" Standing, he narrowed his eyes and took an intimidating stance above Kellan. \"All I\u0027m asking for here is for you to buck it up and do your fucking job. And in case you couldn\u0027t tell . . . I\u0027m not really asking.\" His voice was ice cold; it raised the hair on the back of my neck and filled my stomach with lead. Shifting his focus from Kellan, Nick walked out of the room. There was a thick layer of silence in the room after Nick left. You could have heard a pin drop. Not surprisingly, Griffin was the first to pop the stillness with a loud exclamation. \"Dude! You get to film-fuck Sienna Sexton! High five!\" He held his hand up in the air, palm exposed to Kellan in congratulations. Still shocked at this turn of events, I had no comment to Griffin\u0027s statement. Kellan glared at the bassist, then seemed to realize that was pointless and shifted his gaze to the floor. He was silent one moment longer, then abruptly stood. Staring at the door Nick had strode through, Kellan\u0027s face hardened. \"This is bullshit.\" He stormed out of the room, harshly brushing past my legs in the process. Evan stood in his wake. \"Kellan?\" Kellan didn\u0027t answer him. Hands clenched into fists, he disappeared without a backwards glance at his band. We all stood and stared after him. \"What\u0027s he gonna do?\" Matt asked the room. No one had an answer, and a feeling of dread pricked my skin. I knew exactly what he was going to do. What he always did when things got too hard. He was going to run. I took off after Kellan, the guys following after me. Kellan wasn\u0027t on the stairs, and for once the stunning view didn\u0027t impress me. Nothing was impressing me at the moment, because I was pretty sure I was going to have to do something I did not want to do. I was going to have to convince Kellan to make out with another woman. No, not just make out. Simulate a love scene. Somehow, that made the whole thing ten times worse. I found Kellan in our room. Face stormy, he was shoving shirts in his bag. My empty bag lay beside his. A part of me wanted to start packing up my stuff in silent concession. That would be an infinitely easier choice. Instead, as Evan, Matt, and Griffin trailed into the room behind me, I asked, \"What are you doing?\" Kellan glanced up at me, his eyes blazing. \"Pack your stuff. We\u0027re going home. I\u0027m done.\" Griffin immediately burst out, \"What the fuck, Kellan?\" Evan put a hand on Kellan\u0027s shoulder, trying to calm him down; Kellan shrugged him off. Matt quietly countered with, \"We signed a contract, Kellan. We can\u0027t just walk away.\" Kellan glared at Matt, snapping, \"Then they can fucking sue us! I\u0027m not whoring myself out for them. I\u0027m going back to Pete\u0027s. Are you guys coming with me or not?\" Knowing that all of this was ultimately because of me, my heart thudded in my chest in a painful staccato rhythm. Griffin gaped at him. \"You are the biggest fucking pussy-\" Kellan took two aggressive steps toward Griffin, silencing him. Evan stepped between the pair, his hands on Kellan\u0027s shoulders. Matt put a hand on Griffin\u0027s chest, keeping him back as well. There was suddenly so much tension in the air that I knew nothing constructive was going to happen while everyone was present. Kellan needed to be calmed down, not confronted. And, at the moment, I was the only one who could do it. I hated that the power was in my hands. Especially when going back to Pete\u0027s sounded like a fabulous idea. Keeping my eyes locked on Kellan, I told the guys, \"Could you give me a moment with my husband, please?\" Kellan snapped his eyes to mine, his expression still searing. Evan stepped away from Kellan, squeezing my arm before he left. Matt dragged Griffin out of the room, but not before Griffin shouted, \"You talk some fucking sense into him, Kiera! This is bullshit!\" When I heard the door close, I took a step toward Kellan. With no one else in the room, Kellan\u0027s anger and frustration turned solely toward me. I was prepared for it, though; I\u0027d been on the receiving end of vicious snarls from Kellan more than once. \"You gonna call me a pussy too? Think I ought to go ahead and fuck Sienna, just to prove a point?\" I cringed a little, but let it slide off of my back. His anger wasn\u0027t really directed at me. Walking over to him, I grabbed his hands; they were still clenched into fists. \"Kellan . . . you can\u0027t give up now.\" Kellan pried a hand loose and pointed at the door. \"Were you in that meeting? Did you hear what they want me to do?\" Grabbing his hand again, I nodded. \"Yes, and it\u0027s okay.\" Just saying the words made my stomach tighten, but it had to be done. Kellan gaped at me. \"It\u0027s . . . okay? How is me \u0027film fucking\u0027 someone okay?\" Stepping into his body, I trailed my fingers up his arms and wrapped them around the back of his neck. He was rigid at first, but he gradually relaxed as I held him. \"Well, all right, maybe \u0027okay\u0027 isn\u0027t the best word. The thought of you being with her is actually a little horrifying.\" Kellan\u0027s body started to tense again and I immediately told him, \"But it\u0027s a necessary evil.\" Kellan shook his head, his arms wrapping around my waist. \"No, it isn\u0027t necessary.\" His anger draining, he rested his head against mine. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you. And I don\u0027t see how any of this won\u0027t hurt you.\" Pulling back from him, I said, \"And I don\u0027t want you to give up on your dream because of me.\" He shook his head, looking away from me, and I grabbed his cheek. \"You\u0027re so close, so very close. Just do this one thing to jumpstart your career, to jumpstart the guys\u0027 careers. Then, when you\u0027ve completed your contract terms and you\u0027re the most sought-after band in the industry, find another label. That will prove your point much better than . . . you know.\" Kellan smirked at me, and I smiled at seeing some of his humor coming back. But the seriousness in his face returned as he exhaled a long breath. He didn\u0027t say anything for several seconds. I could see that his mind was churning, debating, and I gave him a moment to process everything that had just been thrown at him. When he did finally speak, his voice was quiet. \"I don\u0027t want to let the guys down, I really don\u0027t, and I see what you\u0027re saying. But when I said I was through with other girls, I meant it. You\u0027re it for me. I don\u0027t want to touch her.\" Stroking his skin with my thumb, I murmured, \"I know. And I love you so much for that. But this doesn\u0027t have to affect us if we don\u0027t let it. You\u0027re still my husband. I\u0027m still your wife. Acting like you feel differently on camera doesn\u0027t change any of that. Okay?\" Kellan slowly nodded, then sighed. \"I\u0027m not even sure if I can film a love scene with someone other than you.\" Running a hand through his still slicked back hair, I husked, \"Sure you can. Just pretend she\u0027s me. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\" I gave him a wry smile so he would know I was teasing. He gave me a devilish grin in response. His face sobered instantly, though. \"You really want me to do this?\" I bit my lip. Did I want this? No. I didn\u0027t want his body anywhere near Sienna\u0027s. But I wanted success for him, and for him to walk away now, over . . . this . . . seemed too great a price for him to pay. I nodded. \"Yes, I do.\" Kellan closed his eyes, nodding once. I gave him a light kiss, hating that someone else would be touching that miraculous mouth soon. \"And, Kellan\"-his eyes cracked opened-\"if this is really going to happen, I need to be there. I need to watch it.\" His eyes sprang all the way open. \"No.\" I nodded, kissing him again. \"I have to, Kellan.\" \"Why?\" he murmured against my lips. \"Why would you want to see that, Kiera?\" Because I\u0027m a glutton for punishment. \"Because it will be so much worse in my head if I don\u0027t.\" \"Kiera,\" he pleaded. \"I don\u0027t want this, but if I have to do it, then I want you as far away from it as possible.\" Pushing my shoulder back, he squatted to look me in the eye. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you, and if our roles were reversed, I couldn\u0027t handle watching you with another man.\" I gave him a sad smile as I whispered, \"You already did.\" Kellan\u0027s mouth parted, and a wave of sadness swept over his features. It broke my heart. \"I love you,\" I told him, bringing my lips to his. Doing my best to erase his sadness, I tasted his lips over and over. His breath eventually picked up as the passionate fire inside him sparked under my administrations. His hands came up to tangle in my hair, holding my head tight to his. His tongue passed over mine, teasing me, and a low moan disrupted the stillness of our bedroom. An erotic noise burrowed up from Kellan\u0027s chest, mixing with my breathy exhales. My impatient hands ran up and under his shirt. I needed all of the barriers between us gone. Now. Kellan broke apart from me to help my eager fingers remove his shirt, then instantly sought my lips again once the material was free. I traced the lines and valleys I knew and loved so well. My fingers found the deep V of his lower abdomen, and I tugged on the waistband of his damp shorts, needing those off as well. Kellan helped me there too, and before I could really comprehend it, he was standing before me, completely bare and not the least bit self-conscious about it. His eyes were hooded as mine roved over his body. He was mine, heart and soul. Sienna may have a brief moment with him-a very tiny, tiny, taste-but she would never have the full magnificence of this stunning man. I almost felt a little sorry for her. Almost. Breath fast, I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled him onto the bed. As soon as my back hit the mattress, he started stripping away my clothes. My damp shorts met up with his on the floor, my tankini briefs immediately following. His hands slid up my sides, taking my top with it, and I groaned when my chest was free. His mouth enclosed a nipple, and I delighted in something I knew he wouldn\u0027t be able to film with her. Not for a PG-13 music video. Kellan, also reveling in what was his and his alone, moved my leg up his hip and immediately sank himself into me. I clutched him tight, groaning \"Yes\" a lot louder than I probably should have. Kellan sucked in a breath through his teeth. \"God, Kiera . . .\" he murmured, before he began to move. Maybe it was the wildly swinging emotions we\u0027d been experiencing just before this moment, but every cell in my body felt energized, alive, and tingling with sensation. And I didn\u0027t hold anything back as Kellan and I rocked together. This was ours, and Sienna would never share in it. And even though she was nowhere near us, I let out my joy as if she could hear it. Kellan did too. And it wasn\u0027t too much longer before we were both approaching the crest, our bodies lightly shaking, slightly damp from the exertion. As my climax burst through me, I raked my nails down Kellan\u0027s back. Not strong enough to draw blood, but strong enough that he would feel it for a while. My little reminder of who we were and what we\u0027d been through. Kellan buried his head into my shoulder. He cried out as his body tensed, then released. I groaned as I felt him, heard him, was one with him. No, Sienna would never have this. Her pale imitation of this moment wouldn\u0027t even come close. Breath heavy, Kellan rolled to my side. I kissed his cheek and he smiled with his eyes still closed. I watched him as he recovered, mesmerized by him. His smile never faded, but his breathing slowed and evened. When his face relaxed and his breathing turned shallow, I realized that I\u0027d relaxed him right into sleep. That gave me a strange feeling of euphoria. But then I started thinking about Wednesday, and my earlier bravado faltered. Maybe Sienna wouldn\u0027t have this moment with him, but was I opening a can of worms by giving them a taste of each other? Was I making a monumental mistake by allowing this to happen? Stealthily sliding out of bed, I folded the comforter around Kellan so he was covered. After putting on some clean, dry clothes, I picked up Kellan\u0027s phone from his nightstand and silently left my sleeping husband. When I got back into the main lounging area, I was expecting to see the other D-Bags waiting around to hear what Kellan had to say. But then my mind replayed the last few moments and I realized that Kellan and I had both been quite vocal, and they probably already knew that I had successfully changed his mind. My cheeks heated, but I ignored the embarrassment. At least no one had walked in on us this time. Griffin came out of the community bathroom as I was making my way to the deck. I froze when I saw him, wondering what obscene comment he was going to make. With a look of pride on his face, he pointed at my closed bedroom door. \"Did you just fuck him into submission?\" He held his knuckles up to me. \"Nice.\" My initial reaction was to scoff, call him a pig, and storm off in a mortified huff. But I\u0027d promised myself that I\u0027d make an attempt to be nice to him, so I shrugged and made myself talk to him. \"I changed his mind about doing the video, but . . . now I\u0027m worried that I made a mistake.\" As Griffin ran a hand through his hair, I realized that this was the first conversation I\u0027d ever really had with him. It was odd, and I had no idea what he would say, or if I would find it offensive or not. He made a dismissive sound with his lips. \"Nah, don\u0027t worry about it. You guys aren\u0027t into sharing, so he won\u0027t really do anything with her.\" He winked at me, and I strangely found it charming instead of creepy. \"Kell knows what side his dick\u0027s buttered on.\" Feeling oddly reassured by his absurd expression, I muttered, \"Thank you . . . I think.\" Griffin laughed as he left the room. \"Anytime, Kiera.\" Shaking my head, I began to wonder if I\u0027d just entered into some strange sort of opposite world, where I encouraged Kellan to make out with other women and found advice from Griffin comforting. What else was going to happen? Anna and Denny hook up and decide to get married and raise Griffin\u0027s baby as their own? That made me laugh as I walked outside. No, no way would those two ever get together. Anna would eat Denny alive. Palms sweaty, I started pacing near the railing. I had a view of the backyard pool and could see Matt and Evan near the edge, both of them chatting on their cell phones, most likely to Rachel and Jenny. Probably telling them the exciting news about their music video with Sienna Sexton. Internally groaning, I pulled up Kellan\u0027s contact list and scrolled through until I found Sienna\u0027s number. Kellan was mine, and I wasn\u0027t just going to roll over and let somebody else nab him from me. She picked up almost immediately. \"Kellan, what a wonderful surprise. What can I do for you, love?\" I bristled at her charming term of endearment, but tried not to think too much of it. She called everyone \"love.\" \"Um, actually, this is Kiera. I\u0027m borrowing Kellan\u0027s phone.\" \"Oh, well, what can I do for you, Kiera?\" There was a small trace of disappointment in her accent, but she covered it well with bubbly politeness. \"I just wanted to let you know that I talked Kellan into doing the music video with you,\" I said. She couldn\u0027t hide the disappointment this time. \"He didn\u0027t want to do the video?\" I sighed, hating that I had to placate both sides. \"He wasn\u0027t okay with the direction the director wanted to take it, filming a love scene with you. But I told him . . . it was fine.\" \"He had to ask for your permission? How . . . quaint.\" Her amusement was evident. Sienna Sexton probably didn\u0027t ask permission for anything. I hesitated, not really wanting to defend Kellan\u0027s actions. And that wasn\u0027t really the point of my phone call anyway. \"Well, the fact that he\u0027s agreed to do it is all that\u0027s important. But, I just wanted to know . . .\" I inhaled a deep breath. Here goes nothing. \"Did I make a mistake encouraging him to film an intimate scene with you? You\u0027re used to getting what you want. Woman to woman, be honest with me . . . do you want my husband?\" There was a long pause on Sienna\u0027s end. My stomach twisted into a knot that I was positive I would never be able to untangle as I waited for her to say yes. When she did, it came as no surprise. \"Yes, I do . . . but not in the way you think.\" I blinked. That did surprise me. Call me naive, but what other way was there? Sienna continued before I could ask. \"My career has hit a . . . stalling point. I need Kellan to refuel it. Being in the tabloids with him just this short while has done wonders for me. I\u0027ve already received collaboration offers from other musicians, and just yesterday, I was handed a movie script.\" As her words sank in, she added, \"So, yes, I want him . . . desperately . . . but only for the buzz.\" \"Oh,\" I murmured. \"Did you need anything else from me, love?\" My mind still spinning, I told her, \"No . . . that was it. Thank you for being honest.\" \"Sure thing. Ta-ta!\" She clicked off the line, and I stared at Kellan\u0027s phone for long seconds. Did I believe her? Could I trust her? Only time would tell.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reckless-thoughtless-3/page-10.html","bookId":1885,"book":{"id":1885,"title":"Reckless (Thoughtless #3)","description":"Storyline: Reckless (Thoughtless #3) When the band hits it big, Kiera and Kellan must ask themselves: Can their love for each other survive the constant pressures of superstardom?
