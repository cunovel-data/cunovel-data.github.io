If you cannot tell me what it is, then I might as well teach you no more, because once you learn the secret of the hat there is no going back. Tell me what you know about the hat.” “Can I hold it?” “Be my guest.” Esk peered inside the hat. There was some wire stiffening to give it a shape, and a couple of hatpins. That was all. There was nothing particularly strange about it, except that no one in the village had one like it. But that didn\u0027t make it magical. Esk bit her lip; she had a vision of herself being sent home in disgrace. It didn\u0027t feel strange, and there were no hidden pockets. It was just a typical witch\u0027s hat. Granny always wore it when she went into the village, but in the forest she just wore a leather hood. She tried to recall the bits of lessons that Granny grudgingly doled out. It isn\u0027t what you know, it\u0027s what other people don\u0027t know. Magic can be something right in the wrong place, or something wrong in the right place. It can be Granny always wore it to the village. And the big black cloak, which certainly wasn\u0027t magical, because for most of the winter it had been a goat blanket and Granny washed it in the spring. Esk began to feel the shape of the answer and she didn\u0027t like it much. It was like a lot of Granny\u0027s answers. Just a word trick. She just said things you knew all the time, but in a different way so they sounded important. “I think I know,” she said at last. “Out with it, then.” “It\u0027s in sort of two parts.” “Well?” “It\u0027s a witch\u0027s hat because you wear it. But you\u0027re a witch because you wear the hat. Um.” “So -”prompted Granny. “So people see you coming in the hat and the cloak and they know you\u0027re a witch and that\u0027s why your magic works?” said Esk. “That\u0027s right,” said Granny. “It\u0027s called headology.” She tapped her silver hair, which was drawn into a tight bun that could crack rocks. “But it\u0027s not real!” Esk protested. “That\u0027s not magic, it\u0027s it\u0027s -” “Listen,” said Granny, “If you give someone a bottle of red jollop for their wind it may work, right, but if you want it to work for sure then you let their mind make it work for them. Tell \u0027em it\u0027s moonbeams bottled in fairy wine or something. Mumble over it a bit. It\u0027s the same with cursing.” “Cursing?” said Esk, weakly. “Aye, cursing, my girl, and no need to look so shocked! You\u0027ll curse, when the need comes. When you\u0027re alone, and there\u0027s no help to hand, and -” She hesitated and, uncomfortably aware of Esk\u0027s questioning eyes, finished lamely: “- and people aren\u0027t showing respect. Make it loud, make it complicated, make it long, and make it up if you have to, but it\u0027ll work all right. Next day, when they hit their thumb or they fall off a ladder or their dog drops dead, they\u0027ll remember you. They\u0027ll behave better next time.” “But it still doesn\u0027t seem like magic,” said Esk, scuffing the dust with her feet. “I saved a man\u0027s life once,” said Granny. “Special medicine, twice a day. Boiled water with a bit of berry juice in it. Told him I\u0027d bought it from the dwarves. That\u0027s the biggest part of doct\u0027rin, really. Most people\u0027ll get over most things if they put their minds to it, you just have to give them an interest.” She patted Esk\u0027s hand as nicely as possible. “You\u0027re a bit young for this,” she said, “but as you grow older you\u0027ll find most people don\u0027t set foot outside their own heads much. You too,” she added gnomically. “I don\u0027t understand.” “I\u0027d be very surprised if you did,” said Granny briskly, “but you can tell me five herbs suitable for dry coughs.” Spring began to unfold in earnest. Granny started taking Esk on long walks that took all day, to hidden ponds or high on to the mountain scree to collect rare plants. Esk enjoyed that, high on the hills where the sun beat down strongly but the air was nevertheless freezing cold. Plants grew thickly and hugged the ground. From some of the highest peaks she could see all the way to the Rim Ocean that ran around the edge of the world; in the other direction the Ramtops marched into the distance, wrapped in eternal winter. They went all the way to the hub of the world where, it was generally agreed, the Gods lived on a ten-mile high mountain of rock and ice. “Gods are all right,” said Granny, as they ate their lunch and looked at the view. “You don\u0027t bother gods, and gods don\u0027t come bothering you.” “Do you know many gods?” “I\u0027ve seen the thundergods a few times,” said Granny, “and Hoki, of course.” “Hold? ” Granny chewed a crustless sandwich. “Oh, he\u0027s a nature god,” she said. “Sometimes he manifests himself as an oak tree, or half a man and half a goat, but mainly I see him in his aspect as a bloody nuisance. You only find him in the deep woods, of course. He plays the flute. Very badly, if you must know.” Esk lay on her stomach and looked out across the lands below while a few hardy, self-employed bumblebees patrolled the thyme clusters. The sun was warm on her back but, up here, there were still drifts of snow on the hubside of rocks. “Tell me about the lands down there,” she said lazily. Granny peered disapprovingly at ten thousand miles of landscape. “They\u0027re just other places,” she said. “Just like here, only different.” “Are there cities and things?” “Idaresay.” “Haven\u0027t you ever been to look?” Granny sat back, gingerly arranging her skirt to expose several inches of respectable flannelette to the sun, and let the heat caress her old bones. “No,” she said. “There\u0027s quite enough troubles around here without going to look for them in forn parts.” “I dreamed of a city once,” said Esk. “It had hundreds of people in it, and there was this building with big gates, and they were magical gates -” A sound like tearing cloth came from behind her. Granny had fallen asleep. “Granny! ” “Mhnf?” Esk thought for a moment. “Are you having a good time?” she said artfully. “Mnph.” “You said you\u0027d show me some real magic, all in good time,” said Esk, “and this is a good time.” “Mnph.” Granny Weatherwax opened her eyes and looked straight up at the sky; it was darker up here, more purple than blue. She thought: why not? She\u0027s a quick learner. She knows more herblore than I do. At her age old Gammer Tumult had me Borrowing and Shifting and Sending all the hours of the day. Maybe I\u0027m being too cautious. “Just a bit?” pleaded Esk. Granny turned it over in her mind. She couldn\u0027t think of any more excuses. I\u0027m surely going to regret this, she told herself, displaying considerable foresight. “All right,” she said shortly. “Real magic?” said Esk. “Not more herbs or headology?” “Real magic, as you call it, yes.” “A spell?” “No. A Borrowing.” Esk\u0027s face was a picture of expectation. She looked more alive, it seemed to Granny, than she had ever been before. Granny looked over the valleys stretching out before them until she found what she was after. A grey eagle was circling lazily over a distant blue-hazed patch of forest. Its mind was currently at ease. It would do nicely. She Called it gently, and it began to circle towards them. “The first thing to remember about Borrowing is that you must be comfortable and somewhere safe,” she said, smoothing out the grass behind her. “Bed\u0027s best.” “But what is Borrowing?” “Lie down and hold my hand. Do you see the eagle up there?” Esk squinted into the dark, hot sky. There were . . . two doll figures on the grass below as she pivoted on the wind .... She could feel the whip and wire of the air through her feathers. Because the eagle was not hunting, but simply enjoying the feel of the sun on its wings, the land below was a mere unimportant shape. But the air, the air was a complex, changing three-dimensional thing, an interlocked pattern of spirals and curves that stretched away into the distance, a switchback of currents built around thermal pillars. She . . . . . . felt a gentle pressure restraining her. “The next thing to remember, ” said Granny\u0027s voice, very close, “is not to upset the owner. If you let it know you\u0027re there it\u0027ll either fight you or panic, and you won\u0027t stand a chance either way. It\u0027s had a lifetime of being an eagle, and you haven\u0027t.” Esk said nothing. “You\u0027re not frightened, are you?” said Granny. “It can take you that way the first time, and -” “I\u0027m not frightened,” said Esk, and “How do I control it?” “You don\u0027t. Not yet. Anyway, controlling a truly wild creature isn\u0027t easily learned. You have to - sort of suggest to it that it might feel inclined to do things. With a tame animal, of course, it\u0027s all different. But you can\u0027t make any creature do anything that is totally against its nature. Now try and find the eagle\u0027s mind.” Esk could sense Granny as a diffuse silver cloud at the back of her own mind. After some searching she found the eagle. She almost missed it. Its mind was small, sharp and purple, like an arrowhead. It was concentrating entirely on flying, and took no notice of her. “Good,” said Granny approvingly. “We\u0027re not going to go far. If you want to make it turn, you must -” “Yes, yes,” said Esk. She flexed her fingers, wherever they were, and the bird leaned against the air and turned. “Very good,” said Granny, taken aback. “How did you do that?” “I - don\u0027t know. It just seemed obvious.” “Hmph.” Granny gently tested the tiny eagle mind. It was still totally oblivious of its passengers. She was genuinely impressed, a very rare occurrence. They floated over the mountain, while Esk excitedly explored the eagle\u0027s senses. Granny\u0027s voice droned through her consciousness, giving instructions and guidance and warnings. She listened with half an ear. It sounded far too complicated. Why couldn\u0027t she take over the eagle\u0027s mind? It wouldn\u0027t hurt it. She could see how to do it, it was just a knack, like snapping your fingers - which in fact she had never managed to achieve - and then she\u0027d be able to experience flying for real, not at second hand. Then she could “Don\u0027t,” said Granny calmly. “No good will come of it.” “What?” “Do you really think you\u0027re the first, my girl? Do you think we haven\u0027t all thought what a fine thing it would be, to take on another body and tread the wind or breathe the water? And do you really think it would be as easy as that?” Esk glowered at her. “No need to look like that,” said Granny. “You\u0027ll thank me one day. Don\u0027t you start playing around before you know what you\u0027re about, eh? Before you get up to tricks you\u0027ve got to learn what to do if things go wrong. Don\u0027t try to walk before you can run.” “I can feel how to do it, Granny.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/equal-rites-discworld-3/page-7.html","bookId":1622,"book":{"id":1622,"title":"Equal Rites (Discworld #3)","description":"Storyline: Equal Rites (Discworld #3) On Discworld, a dying wizard tries to pass on his powers to an eighth son of an eighth son, who is just at that moment being born.
