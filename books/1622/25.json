{"id":95137,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"“Yes,” said Esk. “Granny, about this wizard magic, it\u0027s all words -”\\n\\n “Always said it was,” said Granny.\\n\\n “No, I mean -” Esk began, but Granny waved a hand irritably.\\n\\n “Can\u0027t be bothered with this at the moment,” she said. “I\u0027ve got some big orders to fill by tonight, if it goes on like this I\u0027m going to have to train someone up. Can\u0027t you come and see me when you get an afternoon off, or whatever it is they give you?”\\n\\n “Train someone up?” said Esk, horrified. “You mean as a witch?”\\n\\n “No,” said Granny. “I mean, perhaps.”\\n\\n “But what about me?”\\n\\n “Well, you\u0027re going your own way,” said Granny. “Wherever that is.”\\n\\n “Mmph,” said Esk. Granny stared at her.\\n\\n “I\u0027ll be off, then,” she said at last. She turned and strode off towards the kitchen entrance. As she did so her cloak swirled out, and Esk saw that it was now lined with red. A dark, winy red, but red nevertheless. On Granny, who had never been known to wear any visible clothing that was other than a serviceable black, it was quite shocking.\\n\\n “The library?” said Mrs Whitlow. “Aye don\u0027t think anyone cleans the library!” She looked genuinely puzzled.\\n\\n “Why?” said Esk, “Doesn\u0027t it get dusty?”\\n\\n “Well,” said Mrs Whitlow. She thought for a while. “Aye suppose it must do, since you come to mention it. Aye never really thought about it.”\\n\\n “You see, I\u0027ve cleaned everywhere else,” said Esk, sweetly.\\n\\n “Yes,” said Mrs Whitlow, “You have, haven\u0027t you.”\\n\\n “Well, then.”\\n\\n “It\u0027s just that we\u0027ve never - done it before,” said Mrs Whitlow, “but for the life of me, Aye can\u0027t think why.”\\n\\n “Well, then,” said Esk.\\n\\n “Ook?” said the Head Librarian, and backed away from Esk. But she had heard about him and had come prepared. She offered him a banana.\\n\\n The orang-outan reached out slowly and then snatched it with a grin of triumph.\\n\\n There may be universes where librarianship is considered a peaceful sort of occupation, and where the risks are limited to large volumes falling off the shelves on to one\u0027s head, but the keeper of a magic library is no job for the unwary. Spells have power, and merely writing them down and shoving them between covers doesn\u0027t do anything to reduce it. The stuff leaks. Books tend to react with one another, creating randomised magic with a mind of its own. Books of magic are usually chained to their shelves, but not to prevent them being stolen ....\\n\\n One such accident had turned the librarian into an ape, since when he had resisted all attempts to turn him back, explaining in sign language that life as an orang-outan was considerably better than life as a human being, because all the big philosophical questions resolved themselves into wondering where the next banana was coming from. Anyway, long arms and prehensile feet were ideal for dealing with high shelves.\\n\\n Esk gave him the whole bunch of bananas and scurried away amongst the books before he could object.\\n\\n Esk had never seen more than one book at a time and so the library was, for all she knew, just like any other library. True, it was a bit odd the way the floor seemed to become the wall in the distance, and there was something strange about the way the shelves played tricks on the eyes and seemed to twist through rather more dimensions than the normal three, and it was quite surprising to look up and see shelves on the ceiling, with the occasional student wandering unconcernedly among them.\\n\\n The truth was that the presence of so much magic distorted the space around it. Down in the stacks the very denim, or possibly flannelette, of the universe was tortured into very peculiar shapes. The millions of trapped words, unable to escape, bent reality around them.\\n\\n It seemed logical to Esk that among all these books should be one that told you how to read all the others. She wasn\u0027t sure how to find it, but deep in her soul she felt it would probably have pictures of cheerful rabbits and happy kittens on the cover.\\n\\n The library certainly wasn\u0027t silent. There was the occasional zip and sizzle of a magical discharge, and an octarine spark would flash from shelf to shelf. Chains clinked, faintly. And, of course, there was the faint rustle of thousands of pages in their leather-bound prisons.\\n\\n Esk made sure no one was paying her any attention and pulled at the nearest volume. It sprang open in her hands, and she saw gloomily that there were the same unpleasant types of diagram that she had noticed in Simon\u0027s book. The writing was entirely unfamiliar, and she was glad about that - it would be horrible to know what all those letters, which seemed to be made up of ugly creatures doing complicated things to each other, actually meant. She forced the cover shut, even though the words seemed to be desperately pushing back. There was a drawing of a creature on the front; it looked suspiciously like one of the things from the cold desert. It certainly didn\u0027t look like a happy kitten.\\n\\n “Hallo! Esk, isn\u0027t it? H-how d-did you get h-here?”\\n\\n It was Simon, standing there with a book under each arm. Esk blushed.\\n\\n “Granny won\u0027t tell me,” she said. “I think it\u0027s something to do with men and women.”\\n\\n Simon looked at her blankly. Then he grinned. Esk thought about the question a second time.\\n\\n “I work here. I sweep up.” She waved the staff in explanation.\\n\\n “Inhere?”\\n\\n Esk stared at him. She felt alone, and lost, and more than a little betrayed. Everyone seemed to be busy living their own lives, except her. She would spend the rest of her life cleaning up after wizards. It wasn\u0027t fair, and she\u0027d had enough.\\n\\n “Actually I don\u0027t. Actually I\u0027m learning to read so I can be a wizard.”\\n\\n The boy regarded her through his damp eyes for some seconds. Then he gently took the book out of Esk\u0027s hands and read its title.\\n\\n “Demonylogie Malyfycorum of Henchanse thee Unsatyfactory. How did you think you could learn to r-read this?”\\n\\n “Um,” said Esk, “Well, you just keep trying until you can, don\u0027t you? Like milking, or knitting, or . . . .” Her voice faded away.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t know about that. These books can be a bit, well, aggressive. If you d-don\u0027t be careful they start reading you.”\\n\\n “What do you mean?”\\n\\n “T-they ssss-”\\n\\n “- say -”said Esk, automatically.\\n\\n “- that there was once a wwww-”\\n\\n “- wizard -”\\n\\n “- who started to r-read the Necrotelecomnicon and let his m-mind wwwwww-”\\n\\n “- wander -”\\n\\n “- and next morning they f-found all his clothes on the chair and hhis hat on t-top of them and the b-book had -”\\n\\n Esk put her fingers in her ears, but not too hard in case she missed anything.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t want to know about it if it\u0027s horrid.”\\n\\n “- had a lot more pages.”\\n\\n Esk took her fingers out of her ears. “Was there anything on the pages?”\\n\\n Simon nodded solemnly. “Yes. On every sssingle one of ththem there www-”\\n\\n “No,” said Esk. “I don\u0027t even want to imagine it. I thought reading was more peaceful than that, I mean, Granny read her Almanack every day and nothing ever happened to her.”\\n\\n “I d-daresay ordinary tame www-”\\n\\n “- words -”\\n\\n “- are all right,” Simon conceded, magnanimously.\\n\\n “Are you absolutely certain?” said Esk.\\n\\n “It\u0027s just that words can have power,” said Simon, slotting the book firmly back on its shelf, where it rattled its chains at him. “And they do say the p-pen is mightier than the sss-”\\n\\n “- sword,” said Esk. “All right, but which would you rather be hit with?”\\n\\n “Um, I d-don\u0027t think it\u0027s any use m-me t-telling you you shouldn\u0027t be in here, is it?” said the young wizard.\\n\\n Esk gave this due consideration. “No,” she said, “I don\u0027t think it is.”\\n\\n “I could send for the p-porters and have you t-taken away.”\\n\\n “Yes, but you won\u0027t.”\\n\\n “I just d-don\u0027t www-”\\n\\n “- want -”\\n\\n “- you to get hurt, you see. I r-really don\u0027t. This can b-be a ddddangerou-”\\n\\n Esk caught a faint swirling in the air above his head. For a moment she saw them, the great grey shapes from the cold place. Watching. And in the calm of the Library, when the weight of magic was wearing the Universe particularly thin, they had decided to Act.\\n\\n Around her the muted rustling of the books rose to a desperate riffling of pages. Some of the more powerful books managed to jerk out of their shelves and swung, flapping madly, from the end of their chains. A huge grimoire plunged from its eyrie on the topmost shelf - tearing itself free of its chain in the process - and flopped away like a frightened chicken, scattering its pages behind it.\\n\\n A magical wind blew away Esk\u0027s headscarf and her hair streamed out behind her. She saw Simon trying to steady himself against a bookshelf as books exploded around him. The air was thick and tasted of tin. It buzzed.\\n\\n “They\u0027re trying to get in!” she screamed.\\n\\n Simon\u0027s tortured face turned to her. A fear-crazed incunable hit him heavily in the small of the back and knocked him to the heaving floor before it bounced high over the shelves. Esk ducked as a flock of thesauri wheeled past, towing their shelf behind them, and scuttled on hands and knees towards him.\\n\\n “That\u0027s what\u0027s making the books so frightened!” she shrieked in his ear. “Can\u0027t you see them up there?”\\n\\n Simon mutely shook his head. A book burst its bindings over them, showering them in pages.\\n\\n Horror can steal into the mind via all the senses. There\u0027s the sound of the little meaningful chuckle in the locked dark room, the sight of half a caterpillar in your forkful of salad, the curious smell from the lodger\u0027s bedroom, the taste of slug in the cauliflower cheese. Touch doesn\u0027t normally get a look-in.\\n\\n But something happened to the floor under Esk\u0027s hands. She looked down, her face a rictus of horror, because the dusty floorboards suddenly felt gritty. And dry. And very, very cold.\\n\\n There was fine silver sand between her fingers.\\n\\n She grabbed the staff and, sheltering her eyes against the wind, waved it at the towering figures above her. It would have been nice to report that a searing flash of pure white fire cleansed the greasy air. It failed to materialise ....\\n\\n The staff twisted like a snake in her hand and caught Simon a crack on the side of the head.\\n\\n The grey Things wavered and vanished.\\n\\n Reality returned, and tried to pretend that it had never left. Silence settled like thick velvet, wave after wave of it. A heavy, echoing silence. A few books dropped heavily out of the air, feeling silly.\\n\\n The floor under Esk\u0027s feet was undoubtedly wooden. She kicked it hard to make sure.\\n\\n There was blood on the floor, and Simon lay very quietly in the centre of it. Esk stared down at him, and then up at the still air, and then at the staff. It looked smug.\\n\\n She was aware of distant voices and hurrying feet.\\n\\n A hand like a fine leather glove slipped gently into hers and a voice behind said “Ook,” very softly. She turned, and found herself staring down into the gentle, inner-tube face of the librarian. He put his finger to his lips in an unmistakable gesture and tugged gently at her hand.\\n\\n “I\u0027ve killed him!” she whispered. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/equal-rites-discworld-3/page-25.html","bookId":1622,"book":{"id":1622,"title":"Equal Rites (Discworld #3)","description":"Storyline: Equal Rites (Discworld #3) \\n On Discworld, a dying wizard tries to pass on his powers to an eighth son of an eighth son, who is just at that moment being born.
