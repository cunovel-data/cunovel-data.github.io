{"id":96139,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The Yankees got the run back with interest in the top of the ninth on a walk to Jeter and a home run by Bernie Williams, and the Tarpons went in order in the bottom of the ninth, with Rivera striking out the first two batters and getting the third to pop to short.\\n\\n “Too bad there was nobody on when Turnbull got his homer,” said Keller’s friend, “but that’s usually the way it is. He’s still good with a stick, but he hits ’em with nobody on, and usually when the team’s too far behind or out in front for it to make any difference.”\\n\\n The two men walked down a succession of ramps and out of the stadium. “I’d like to see old Floyd get the numbers he needs,” the man said, “but I wish he’d get ’em on some other team. What they need for a shot at the flag’s a decent left-handed starter and some help in the bull pen, not an old man with bad knees who hits it out when you don’t need it.”\\n\\n “You think they should trade him?”\\n\\n “They’d love to, but who’d trade for him? He can help a team, but not enough to justify paying him the big bucks. He’s got three years left on his contract, three years at six-point-five million a year. There are teams that could use him, but nobody can use him six-point-five worth. And the Tarps can’t release him and go out and buy the pitching they need, not while they’ve got Turnbull’s salary to pay.”\\n\\n “Tricky business,” Keller said.\\n\\n “And a business is what it is. Well, I’m parked over on Pentland Avenue, so this is where I get off. Nice talking with you.”\\n\\n And off the fellow went, while Keller turned and walked off in the opposite direction. He didn’t know the name of the man he had talked to, and would probably never see him again, and that was fine. In fact it was one of the real pleasures of going to a game, the intense conversations you had with strangers whom you then allowed to remain strangers. The man had been good company, and at the end he’d provided some useful information.\\n\\n Because now Keller had an idea why he’d been hired.\\n\\n “The Tarpons are stuck with Turnbull,” he told Dot. “He draws this huge salary, and they have to pay it whether they play him or not. And I guess that’s where I come in.”\\n\\n “I don’t know,” she said. “Are you sure about this, Keller? That’s a pretty extreme form of corporate downsizing. All that just to keep from paying a man his salary? How much could it amount to?”\\n\\n He told her.\\n\\n “That much,” she said, impressed. “That’s a lot to pay a man to hit a ball with a stick, especially when he doesn’t have to go out and stand around in the hot sun. He just sits on the bench until it’s his turn to bat, right?”\\n\\n “Right.”\\n\\n “Well, I think you might be on to something,” she said. “I don’t know who hired us or why, but your guess makes more sense than anything I could come up with off the top of my head. But I feel myself getting a little nervous, Keller.”\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n “Because this is just the kind of thing that could set your milk to curdling, isn’t it?”\\n\\n “What milk? What are you talking about?”\\n\\n “I’ve known you a long time, Keller. And I can just see you deciding that this is a hell of a way to treat a faithful employee after long years of service, and how can you allow this to happen, di dah di dah di dah. Am I coming through loud and clear?”\\n\\n “The di dah part makes more sense than the rest of it,” he said. “Dot, as far as who hired us and why, all I am is curious. Curiosity’s a long way from righteous indignation.”\\n\\n “Didn’t do much for the cat, as I remember.”\\n\\n “Well,” he said, “I’m not that curious.”\\n\\n “So I’ve got nothing to worry about?”\\n\\n “Not a thing,” he said. “The guy’s a dead man hitting.”\\n\\n The Tarpons closed out the series with the Yankees-and a twelve-game home stand-the following afternoon. They got a good outing from their ace right-hander, who scattered six hits and held the New Yorkers to one run, a bases-empty homer by Brosius. The Tarps won, 3-1, with no help from their designated hitter, who struck out twice, flied to center, and hit a hard liner right at the first baseman.\\n\\n Keller watched from a good seat on the third-base side, then checked out of his hotel and drove to the airport. He turned in his rental car and flew to Milwaukee, where the Brewers would host the Tarps for a three-game series. He picked up a fresh rental and checked in at a motel half a mile from the Marriott where the Tarpons always stayed.\\n\\n The Brewers won the first game, 5-2. Floyd Turnbull had a good night at bat, going three for five with two singles and a double, but he didn’t do anything to affect the outcome; there was nobody on base when he got his hits, and nobody behind him in the order could drive him in.\\n\\n The next night the Tarps got to the Brewers’ rookie southpaw early and blew the game open, scoring six runs in the first inning and winding up with a 13-4 victory. Turnbull’s homer was part of the big first inning, and he collected another hit in the seventh when he doubled into the gap and was thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple.\\n\\n “Why’d he do that?” the bald guy next to Keller wondered. “Two out, and he tries for third? Don’t make the third out at third base, isn’t that what they say?”\\n\\n “When you’re up by nine runs,” Keller said, “I don’t suppose it matters much one way or the other.”\\n\\n “Still,” the man said, “it’s what’s wrong with that prick. Always for himself his whole career. He wanted one more triple in the record book, that’s what he wanted. And forget about the team.”\\n\\n After the game Keller went to a German restaurant south of the city on the lake. The place dripped atmosphere, with beer steins hanging from the hand-hewn oak beams, an oompah band in lederhosen, and fifteen different beers on tap. Keller couldn’t tell the waitresses apart, they all looked like grown-up versions of Heidi, and evidently Floyd Turnbull had the same problem; he called them all Gretchen and ran his hand up under their skirts whenever they came within reach.\\n\\n Keller was there because he’d learned the Tarpons favored the place, but the sauerbraten was reason enough to make the trip. He made his beer last until he’d cleaned his plate, then turned down the waitress’s suggestion of a refill and asked for a cup of coffee instead. By the time she brought it, several more fans had crossed the room to beg autographs from the Tarpons.\\n\\n “They all want their menus signed,” Keller told the waitress. “You people are going to run out of menus.”\\n\\n “It happens all the time,” she said. “Not that we run out of menus, because we never do, but players coming here and our other customers asking for autographs. All the athletes like to come here.”\\n\\n “Well, the food’s great,” he said.\\n\\n “And it’s free. For the players, I mean. It brings in other customers, so it’s worth it to the owner, plus he just likes having his restaurant full of jocks. About it being free for them, I’m not supposed to tell you that.”\\n\\n “It’ll be our little secret.”\\n\\n “You can tell the whole world, for all I care. Tonight’s my last night. I mean, what do I need with jerks like Floyd Turnbull? I want a pelvic exam, I’ll go to my gynecologist, if it’s all the same to you.”\\n\\n “I noticed he was a little free with his hands.”\\n\\n “And close with everything else. They eat and drink free, but most of them at least leave tips. Not good tips, ballplayers are cheap bastards, but they leave something. Turnbull always leaves exactly twenty percent.”\\n\\n “Twenty percent’s not that bad, is it?”\\n\\n “It is when it’s twenty percent of nothing.”\\n\\n “Oh.”\\n\\n “He said he got a home run tonight, too.”\\n\\n “Number three ninety-four of his career,” Keller said.\\n\\n “Well, he’s not getting to first base with me,” she said. “The big jerk.”\\n\\n 3\\n\\n “Night before last,” Keller said, “I was in a German restaurant in Milwaukee.”\\n\\n “ Milwaukee, Keller?”\\n\\n “Well, not exactly in Milwaukee. It was south of the city a few miles, on Lake Michigan.”\\n\\n “That’s close enough,” Dot said. “It’s still a long way from Memphis, isn’t it? Although if it’s south of the city, I guess it’s closer to Memphis than if it was actually inside of Milwaukee.”\\n\\n “Dot…”\\n\\n “Before we get too deep into the geography of it,” she said, “aren’t you supposed to be in Memphis? Taking care of business?”\\n\\n “As a matter of fact…”\\n\\n “And don’t tell me you already took care of business, because I would have heard. CNN would have had it, and they wouldn’t even make me wait until Headline Sports at twenty minutes past the hour. You notice how they never say which hour?”\\n\\n “That’s because of different time zones.”\\n\\n “That’s right, Keller, and what time zone are you in? Or don’t you know?”\\n\\n “I’m in Seattle,” he said.\\n\\n “That’s Pacific time, isn’t it? Three hours behind New York.”\\n\\n “Right.”\\n\\n “But light-years ahead of us,” she said, “in coffee. I’ll bet you can explain, can’t you?”\\n\\n “They’re on a road trip,” he said. “They play half their games at home in Memphis, and half the time they’re in other cities.”\\n\\n “And you’ve been tagging along after them.”\\n\\n “That’s right. I want to take my time, pick my spot. If I have to spend a few dollars on airline tickets, I figure that’s my business. Because nobody said anything about being in a hurry on this one.”\\n\\n “No,” she admitted. “If time is of the essence, nobody told me about it. I just thought you were gallivanting around, going to stamp dealers and all. Taking your eye off the ball, so to speak.”\\n\\n “So to speak,” Keller said.\\n\\n “So how can they play ball in Seattle, Keller? Doesn’t it rain all the time? Or is it one of those stadiums with a lid on it?”\\n\\n “A dome,” he said.\\n\\n “I stand corrected. And here’s another question. What’s Memphis got to do with fish?”\\n\\n “Huh?”\\n\\n “Tarpons,” she said. “Fish. And there’s Memphis, in the middle of the desert.”\\n\\n “Actually, it’s on the Mississippi River.”\\n\\n “Spot any tarpons in the Mississippi River, Keller?”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “And you won’t,” she said, “unless that’s where you stick Turnbull when you finally close the deal. It’s a deep-sea fish, the tarpon, so why pick that name for the Memphis team? Why not call them the Gracelanders?”\\n\\n “They moved,” he explained.\\n\\n “To Milwaukee,” she said, “and then to Seattle, and God knows where they’ll go next.”\\n\\n “No,” he said. “The franchise moved. They started out as an expansion team, the Sarasota Tarpons, but they couldn’t sell enough tickets, so a new owner took over and moved them to Memphis. Look at basketball, the Utah Jazz and the L.A. Lakers. What’s Salt Lake City got to do with jazz, and when did Southern California get to be the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-parade-keller-3/page-2.html","bookId":2314,"book":{"id":2314,"title":"Hit Parade (Keller #3)","description":"Storyline: Hit Parade (Keller #3) \\n Keller is friendly.
