{"id":81837,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"There\u0027s your problem.\"\\n\\n Vicki peered down into the engine of Henry\u0027s BMW. Nothing looked obviously wrong. \"Where\u0027s the problem?\"\\n\\n \"There.\" The mechanic pointed with the screwdriver he held. \"Brakeline, up by the master cylinder.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something wrong with the brakeline?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Holed.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean, holed?\"\\n\\n The mechanic sighed. His expression said \"Women!\" as clearly as if he\u0027d spoken the word aloud. \"Holed. Like, not solid.\"\\n\\n \"Someone put a hole in it?\" It took a moment for the implications of that to sink in. Had the stakes just gone up? Had the killer become aware of her involvement and decided to do something about it? She frowned; that didn\u0027t fit the established pattern. Suddenly the air in the garage, already redolent with iron and oil and gasoline, grew thicker and harder to breathe.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t say someone did it. See here?\" He lifted the black rubber hose on the end of his screwdriver. \"Rubbed against that piece of metal. Rubbed just right between the ribs and broke through.\" Shrugging, he let the hose drop. \"Happens. Brakes work for a while but lose fluid. Lose enough fluid and... \"A greasy finger cut a line across his throat.\\n\\n \"Yes, I know.\" Vicki straightened. \"I was there. So you\u0027ll be telling the police... ?\"\\n\\n \"Accident. Tough luck. Nobody\u0027s fault.\" He shrugged again and turned to shake his head at the destroyed side of the car. \"Hard to believe everyone walked away. Lucky.\"\\n\\n Very lucky, Vicki realized. Death had missed her by less than a couple of feet and if Rose had been riding on the passenger side, she wouldn\u0027t have survived. Holding her glasses on her nose, Vicki bent over the brakeline again; something didn\u0027t look right.\\n\\n \"Why the hell would anyone build a car so that the brakeline rubbed?\"\\n\\n She could hear the shrug in the mechanic\u0027s voice. \"Could be \u0027cause it\u0027s an old car. Built in \u002776, things go wrong. Could\u0027ve been a mistake on the line. No two cars are exactly alike.\"\\n\\n All right, it made sense, bad luck and nothing more had put her and Rose and Peter in the car when that little mistake had paid off. Jesus, if you can\u0027t count on a BMW...\\n\\n Except... There were two spots bracketing the tear where the yellow markings on the hose showed brighter, places where accumulated dirt could have rubbed off on someone\u0027s fingers as they gave that little mistake a helping hand. Careful not to touch the rubber, Vicki pressed her finger against the protruding bit of metal that had done the actual damage. While not exactly sharp, it held a definite edge.\\n\\n \"Suppose you wanted to hole someone\u0027s brakeline and yet made it look like an accident,\" she gestured down into the engine, \"how long would it take you to duplicate that?\"\\n\\n The mechanic looked speculative. \"Not long.\"\\n\\n They\u0027d been in the restaurant for an hour and a half. Plenty of time.\\n\\n Intrigued by the idea, he reached down into the car. \"I\u0027d grab it here... \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t touch it!\"\\n\\n He jerked back as though stung. \"You don\u0027t think... \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I want to take any chances. I want you to call the police. I have the number of the officer at the scene if you don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"No. I got it.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Tell him you\u0027ve found suspicions of tampering and, if nothing else, they should take prints.\" She had her own small kit, not exactly high tech but certainly up to lifting prints off greasy hoses. If, however, police technology could be brought to bear, so much the better.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you call?\"\\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re the expert.\"\\n\\n He scowled at her for a moment then sighed and said, \"Okay, lady. You win. I\u0027ll call.\"\\n\\n \"Now,\" she suggested.\\n\\n \"Okay. Now. You don\u0027t touch nothing while I\u0027m gone.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. And you don\u0027t touch anything until the ident man has come and gone.\"\\n\\n The scowl returned. He went two steps, stopped, and looked back. \"Someone tried to kill you, eh?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" Or Peter. Or Rose.\\n\\n He shook his head, his expression hovering between respect and disgust. \"Bet it isn\u0027t the first time.\" He continued to the office without waiting for a reply.\\n\\n Vicki rubbed her right thumb against the faint scars on her left wrist, saw again the inhuman smile, and heard the demon say, \"So you are to be the sacrifice.\" A trickle of sweat that had nothing to do with the heat ran down between her breasts and behind it, she could feel her heart begin to race. Death had been so close that a shadow of it remained long after the substance had been defeated. With practiced skill, she pushed the memory away and buried it deep.\\n\\n The world outside the memory seemed strange for a moment then she shook her head and forced herself back to the present. Out by the car, Rose was telling Celluci some kind of story that involved a great deal of arm waving, Peter hovering protectively at her side. When Celluci laughed at something Rose said, Vicki saw Peter\u0027s shoulders stiffen.\\n\\n \"Peter! Could you come here, please?\"\\n\\n Reluctantly, he came.\\n\\n She nodded toward the car. \"What are the odds that you could pick up someone\u0027s scent off a rubber brake-line?\"\\n\\n Peter glanced down into the engine and wrinkled his nose. \"Slim to none. The smell of the brake fluid is kind of strong. Why?\"\\n\\n Vicki saw no point in lying, the wer already knew they were under the threat of death. \"I think someone engineered yesterday\u0027s accident.\"\\n\\n \"Wow. Henry\u0027s going to be pissed.\"\\n\\n \"Henry?\"\\n\\n \"Well, they totaled his car.\"\\n\\n \"And almost killed us,\" Vicki reminded him.\\n\\n \"Oh. Yeah.\"\\n\\n The office door opened and the mechanic walked back into the garage. He didn\u0027t look thrilled. \"Okay. I called. He says someone\u0027ll come around. Later.\" He glared at the car and then up at Vicki. \"He says he wants to talk to you. Don\u0027t leave town.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of it. Thanks, you\u0027ve been a big help.\"\\n\\n He returned her smile with a snort and pointedly bent to work on a late model, blue Saab that had seen better days.\\n\\n Vicki recognized a dismissal when she saw it. As there was nothing more she could do here, she even decided to pay attention to it. \"Come on, Peter.\"\\n\\n Frowning thoughtfully, Peter followed her out of the garage.\\n\\n \"What?\" she asked as they crossed the parking lot to Celluci\u0027s car.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s probably nothing, but while you were talking to Mr. Sunshine I had a sniff around the edges of the hood. I mean, if someone messed with the brakes they had to get the hood open first.\" He took a deep breath. \"Anyway, for just a second there, I thought I caught a scent I recognized. Then I lost it. Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Would you know it again?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, if you do come across it, tell me immediately. This guy is dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" he protested. \"I know. It\u0027s my dad that got shot.\"\\n\\n Vicki wondered if she should tell him that the person who\u0027d shot his father and the person who\u0027d tampered with Henry\u0027s car weren\u0027t likely to be the same man - the actions were far too different - and in her book this new threat, with no pattern to make it predictable, was a lot more dangerous. She decided against it. What good would it do?\\n\\n Celluci watched until Peter and Rose had gone inside then he backed out of Dr. Dixon\u0027s driveway and headed downtown. \"It\u0027s hard not to like them, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s not to like?\"\\n\\n \"This from the woman who once said that teenagers should be against the law?\"\\n\\n \"Well, they\u0027re not exactly your typical teenagers, are they?\"\\n\\n Celluci glanced sideways at her. \"All right, what\u0027s bothering you? You\u0027ve been in a mood since we left the garage.\"\\n\\n Vicki shoved her glasses up her nose and sighed. \"I was just thinking... \"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a first.\"\\n\\n She ignored him. \"... that if someone\u0027s taking the trouble to try to kill me, I must know something I\u0027m not aware of knowing. The killer thinks I\u0027m getting too close.\"\\n\\n \"Or you weren\u0027t the target, Rose and Peter were. You were just there.\"\\n\\n \"No, there\u0027s already a system set up to kill the wer, why change it? It\u0027s still working. I have a feeling this was aimed at me.\"\\n\\n \"A hunch?\"\\n\\n \"Call it what you like, but if you call it woman\u0027s intuition, I\u0027ll rip your face off.\"\\n\\n As he had no intention of saying anything so blatantly suicidal, he ignored the threat. \"So let\u0027s go over what you do know.\"\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t take that long.\" Knees braced against the dash, Vicki ticked the points off on her fingers. \"I know Barry Wu didn\u0027t do it. I know Dr. Dixon didn\u0027t do it. I know Arthur Fortrin didn\u0027t do it. Anyone else might have, up to and including a chance acquaintance either of those three might have bragged to in a bar. Once Barry tells me who around London is capable of that kind of shot, well, I\u0027ll make some comparisons with those lists of the people who use the conservation area regularly. Hopefully we can decode these directions to his apartment before he leaves for work.\"\\n\\n Celluci plucked the sheet of paper off her lap, scanned it, and tossed it back. He had complete faith in his ability to find his way around in spite of the morning\u0027s scenic tour of the countryside. \"And if Barry doesn\u0027t know?\"\\n\\n \"Someone knows. I\u0027ll find them.\" She smoothed the map out on her leg. \"Oh, and it isn\u0027t Frederick Kleinbein either.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Technically, I guess you could call him their nearest neighbor. He informed me that the Heerkens have a deep, dark secret.\" She grinned. \"They\u0027re nudists, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Nudists?\"\\n\\n \"So he tells me. Apparently, the locals prefer to believe in nudists over werewolves.\"\\n\\n He shot her a sour look. \"Hardly surprising. I am, however, surprised it hasn\u0027t brought flocks of young men out armed with telephoto lenses.\"\\n\\n \"I got the impression the \u0027dogs\u0027 took care of that problem.\"\\n\\n Celluci who had been on the receiving end of one of those \"dogs\" in action could see how it might discourage a casual voyeur.\\n\\n Vicki interpreted his grunt as agreement and went on. \"The only other people I\u0027ve really talked to are Carl Biehn and Mark Williams.\"\\n\\n It took him a moment to place the names. \"The two guys this morning?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"So maybe it\u0027s them.\"\\n\\n \"Not likely.\" She snorted. \"Can you see someone like Williams taking the time and trouble to become a marksman? Uh uh. The way I read him, it\u0027s instant gratification or he\u0027s not interested.\"\\n\\n \"And the older man? The uncle?\"\\n\\n Vicki sighed. \"He\u0027s a vegetarian.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not eating the wer, Vicki, he\u0027s just killing them.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s a deeply religious man.\"\\n\\n \"So are a lot of nut cakes. It\u0027s not mutually exclusive.\"\\n\\n \"And he gardens.\"\\n\\n \"And you like him.\"\\n\\n She sighed again, flicking the air-conditioning vent open and closed. \"Yeah. And I like him. He seems like such a basically decent person.\"\\n\\n \"Another feeling?\"\\n\\n \"Piss off, Celluci.\" Between the bright sunlight, yesterday\u0027s injury, and the lack of sleep, she was developing one mother of a headache. \"Having a slime-bag for a nephew is hardly grounds to accuse someone of multiple murders. I am, however, going to ask Barry to check out Mr. Williams for priors, just in case. If you want to be helpful, and the wind is in the right direction, you can spend tonight watching the tree.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you very much. Just what I always wanted to do, spend the night out in the woods being eaten alive by mosquitoes.\" While you and Henry are comfy cozy inside? Not fucking likely. He glanced over at her and then back at the road. \"Who says he\u0027ll go back to it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s part of his pattern when the wind\u0027s off the field.\"\\n\\n \"Then why don\u0027t you cut it down?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve thought about it.\"\\n\\n \"While you\u0027re thinking about that, here\u0027s another one. If you know he keeps going back to that tree, why haven\u0027t you staked it out?\"\\n\\n \"How? You know I can\u0027t see a damned thing after dark. Besides, Henry went out... \"\\n\\n \"You sent a civilian!\"\\n\\n \"He volunteered!\" Vicki snapped, ignoring the fact that she herself was now a civilian.\\n\\n \"And did he volunteer to get shot?\"\\n\\n \"Henry\u0027s a grown man. He knew the risks.\"\\n\\n \"A grown man. Right. And that\u0027s another thing, according to his driver\u0027s license, Fitzroy is only twenty-four years old.\" He took his eyes off the road long enough to glare at her. \"You\u0027re almost eight years older than he is, or doesn\u0027t that... What\u0027s so funny?\"\\n\\n Although the vibrations were doing nasty things to the inside of her head, Vicki couldn\u0027t stop laughing. Eight whole years. Good God. Finally, the frigid silence on the other side of the car got through and she managed to get ahold of herself. Eight whole years... She took her glasses off and wiped her eyes on the shoulder of her shirt. \"Mike, you have no idea of how little that matters.\"\\n\\n \"Obviously not,\" Celluci grunted through gritted teeth.\\n\\n \"Hey! Are we in hot pursuit or something? You just accelerated through a yellow light.\" Vicki took one look at the set of his jaw and decided the time had come to change the subject. \"What could I possibly know that\u0027s worth killing to protect?\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t the most graceful of conversational transitions but Celluci grabbed at it. He suddenly did not want to know what she\u0027d been laughing at. At a full twelve years older than Henry fucking Fitzroy, he didn\u0027t think his ego was up to it. \"If I were you, I\u0027d have Carl Biehn and his nephew pulled in for questioning.\"\\n\\n \"On what grounds?\"\\n\\n \"Someone thinks you\u0027re getting too close and they\u0027re the only someones you\u0027ve talked to who haven\u0027t been cleared.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re not me.\" Vicki scratched at a mosquito bite on the back of her calf. \"And in case you\u0027ve missed the point, not only is this not a police case but we can\u0027t get the police involved.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re already involved, or have you forgotten last night\u0027s reported gunshot wound?\"\\n\\n \"Queen Street. Turn here. Barry\u0027s apartment building is number 321.\" Pushing her glasses up her nose, she added. \"The police only think they\u0027re involved. They haven\u0027t a clue about what\u0027s really going on.\"\\n\\n \"And you don\u0027t think they\u0027ll find out?\" he asked while swinging wide around the corner to avoid a small boy on a bicycle.\\n\\n Vicki spread her hands. \"How are they going to find out? You going to tell them?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll investigate.\"\\n\\n \"Sure they will. The OPP\u0027ll swing around by the conservation area a little more frequently for a couple of weeks and then something more important than an accidental shooting\u0027ll come up for them to allot man-hours to.\"\\n\\n \"But it wasn\u0027t an accident,\" Celluci pointed out, making an effort and keeping his temper.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t know that.\" Vicki forced herself to relax. Clenched teeth just made her temple throb and had no effect on the thickhead sitting next to her. \"Nor are they going to find out.\"\\n\\n \"Well, they\u0027re going to have to get involved when you find out who\u0027s doing the killing. Or,\" he continued sarcastically, \"had you planned on arranging an accident that would take care of everything?\"\\n\\n \"There.\" She pointed. \"Three twenty-one. Sign says visitor\u0027s parking is in the rear.\"\\n\\n The silence around the words spoke volumes.\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ, Vicki. You aren\u0027t going to bring this to trial, are you?\"\\n\\n She studied the toes of her sneakers.\\n\\n \"Answer me, damn it!\" He slammed on the brakes and, almost before the car had stopped, grabbed her shoulder, twisting her around to face him.\\n\\n \"Trial?\" She jerked her shoulder free. God, he was so dense sometimes. \"And what happens to the wer at a trial?\"\\n\\n \"The law... \"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t want the law, Celluci, they want justice and if the killer goes to trial they won\u0027t get it. You know as well as I do that the victim goes on trial with the accused. What kind of a chance would the wer have? If you\u0027re not white, or you\u0027re poor, or, God forbid, you\u0027re a woman, the system sees you as less than human. The wer aren\u0027t human! How do you think the system is going to see them? And what kind of a life would they have after it was finished with them?\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t believe what he was hearing. \"Are you trying to convince me or are you trying to convince yourself?\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Celluci!\" He was deliberately not understanding. His own neat little world view gets screwed and he can\u0027t adapt. That\u0027s not my fault.\\n\\n His voice rose in volume to match hers. \"I\u0027m not going to stand around and watch you throw away everything you\u0027ve believed in for so long.\"\\n\\n \"Then leave!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re willing to be judge and jury - who\u0027s to be the executioner? Or are you going to do that, too?\"\\n\\n They stared at each other for moment then Vicki closed her eyes. The pounding of her heart became rifle fire and on the inside of her lids she saw Donald, bleeding, then one by one the rest of the pack, sprawled where the bullets dropped them, their fur splattered with blood, and only she was left to mourn. She drew in a long shuddering breath, and then another, and then she opened her eyes.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said quietly. \"I\u0027ll do what I have to.\"\\n\\n \"And if that includes murder?\"\\n\\n \"Leave it, Mike. Please. I said I didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n He forced both hands up through his hair, closing his lips around all but one of the things he wanted to say. He even managed to keep his voice sounding reasonably calm. \"You used to know.\"\\n\\n \"Life used to be a lot simpler. Besides,\" she unhooked the seat belt, gave a shaky and totally unconvincing laugh, and opened the car door. \"I haven\u0027t even caught the son-of-a-bitch yet. Let\u0027s worry about this shit when it hits the fan.\"\\n\\n Celluci followed her into Barry Wu\u0027s building, concern and anger in about equal proportions grinding together inside his head. Life used to be a lot simpler. He sure couldn\u0027t argue with that.\\n\\n \"Most of all, you need a good set of knives.\"\\n\\n \"I have the knives.\"\\n\\n \"Pah. New knives. Factory edges are crap.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have them sharpened this afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Pah.\" The elderly man pulled a torn envelope out of the mess of papers on the kitchen table and scribbled an address on the back of it. \"Go here,\" he commanded as he passed it to his visitor, \"last place in town that might do a decent job.\"\\n\\n Mark Williams folded the paper in half and tucked it in his wallet. A few questions asked around the fur trade had gotten him the old man\u0027s name. A fifty had bought him a couple of hours of instruction. Considering what the pelts were going to net him, he considered it money well spent.\\n\\n \"Okay. Listen up. We go over this one more time and if you go slow you shouldn\u0027t have any trouble. Your first cut is along the length of the belly - almost a seam there anyway - then... \"\\n\\n \"The problem is, there isn\u0027t anyone else. In fact, I\u0027m not positive I could make those shots myself. Not at night.\" Barry stuck his head out of the bedroom where he was getting dressed for work. \"I haven\u0027t done much scope work.\"\\n\\n \"What about one of the special weapons and tactics people?\"\\n\\n His eyebrows drew down. \"You mean a cop?\"\\n\\n Celluci sighed. In his opinion, young men always looked petulant when they tried to scowl. \"You trying to tell me London\u0027s never had a bad cop?\"\\n\\n \"Well... no... but it\u0027s not like we\u0027re Toronto or anything.\" He disappeared back into the bedroom and emerged a moment later, uniform shirt hanging open and carrying his boots. \"I guess I could ask around,\" he offered, perching on the edge of the one remaining empty chair. The apartment was a little short of furniture although both the television and stereo system were first rate. \"But frankly, I don\u0027t think any of those guys could do it either.\" He took a deep breath. \"I know it sounds like bragging but even considering my lack of scope work, none of them are in my league.\"\\n\\n Vicki picked Barry\u0027s police college graduation picture up from its place of honor on top of the television. Only one of the earnestly smiling faces in the photograph belonged to a visible minority; Barry Wu. Plus five women and a werewolf. What a great mix. All the women were white. Technically, so was the werewolf. And the police wonder why community relations are falling apart. Actually, she had to admit, the police knew why community relations were falling apart, they just couldn\u0027t come up with the quick fix solution everybody wanted in the face of such a long-term problem. Unfortunately, \"it\u0027ll take time\" wasn\u0027t much of an answer when time was running out.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised the S.W.A.T. boys haven\u0027t scooped you up.\" She carefully set the picture back down. It was still strange thinking of herself and the police as separate units.\\n\\n He smiled a little self-consciously. \"I\u0027ve been warned the moment I come back with Olympic gold, I\u0027m theirs.\" The smile faded as he bent to lace his boots. \"I guess I\u0027d better check them out, hadn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you can find out what their best marksmen were doing on the nights of the murders, it would help.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" He sighed. \"Pity we didn\u0027t have some big hostage crisis those nights that\u0027d clear them.\"\\n\\n \"Pity,\" Vicki agreed, and hid a totally inappropriate smile. The boy - young man - had been completely serious.\\n\\n \"I just can\u0027t believe that someone\u0027d be shooting at Colin\u0027s family. I mean,\" he sat up and began buttoning his shirt, fingers trembling with indignation, \"they\u0027re probably the nicest people I know.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t bother you that these people turn into animals?\" Celluci asked.\\n\\n Barry stiffened. \"They don\u0027t turn into animals,\" he snapped. \"Just because they have a fur-form doesn\u0027t make them animals. And anyway, most of the animals I\u0027ve met lately have been on two legs! And besides, Colin\u0027s a great cop. Once he picks up a suspect\u0027s scent the perp\u0027s had it. You couldn\u0027t ask for a better guy to back you up in a tight situation, and what\u0027s more, the wer practically invented the concept of the team-player.\"\\n\\n \"I only wondered if it bothered you,\" Celluci told him mildly.\\n\\n \"No.\" Savagely shoving his shirttails into his pants, Barry turned faintly red. \"Not anymore. I mean, once you get to know a guy, you can\u0027t hate him just because he\u0027s a werewolf.\"\\n\\n Words of wisdom for our time, Vicki thought. \"Back to the shooting... \"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I think I know someone who might be able to help. Bertie Reid. She\u0027s a real buff, you know, one of those people who can quote facts and figures at you from the last fifty years. If there\u0027s someone in the area capable of making those shots, she\u0027ll know it. Or she\u0027ll be able to find it out.\"\\n\\n \"Does she shoot?\"\\n\\n \"Occasionally small arms but not the high caliber stuff anymore. She must be over seventy.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know her address?\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t, and her phone number is unlisted - I heard her mention it one day at the range - but she\u0027s not hard to find. She drops by the Grove Road Sportsman\u0027s Club most afternoons, sits up in the clubroom, has a few cups of tea and criticizes everyone\u0027s shooting.\" He glanced up from the piece of paper he was writing the directions on. \"She told me I kept my forward arm too tense.\" Flexing the arm in question, he added, \"She was right.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you practice at the police range?\" Celluci asked.\\n\\n Barry looked a little sheepish as he handed over the address of the club. \"I do occasionally. But I always end up with an audience and, well, the targets there all look like people. I don\u0027t like that.\"\\n\\n \"I never cared for it much myself,\" Vicki told him, dropping the folded piece of paper in her purse. It might be realistic, certainly anything a cop would have to shoot would be people-shaped, but the yearly weapons qualifying always left her feeling slightly ashamed of her skill.\\n\\n They accompanied Barry down to the parking lot, watched him shrug into a leather jacket - \"I\u0027d rather sweat than leave my elbows on the pavement.\" - and a helmet with a day-glow orange strip down the back, carefully pack his cap under the seat of his motorcycle, and roar away.\\n\\n Vicki sighed, carefully leaning back on the hot metal of Celluci\u0027s car. \"Please tell me I was never that gung ho.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t,\" Celluci snorted. \"You were worse.\" He opened the car door and eased himself down onto the vinyl seat. There hadn\u0027t been any shade to park in, not that he would have seen it given the conversation they\u0027d been involved in when they arrived. Swearing under his breath as his elbow brushed the heated seat-back, he unlocked Vicki\u0027s door and was busying himself with the air conditioning when she got in.\\n\\n The echoes of their fight hung in the car. Neither of them spoke, afraid it might begin again.\\n\\n Celluci had no desire to do a monologue on the dangers of making moral judgments and he knew that as far as Vicki was concerned the topic was closed. But if she thinks I\u0027m leaving before this is over, she can think again. He didn\u0027t have to be back at work until Thursday and after that, if he had to, he\u0027d use sick time. It was more than Henry Fitzroy now, Vicki needed saving from herself.\\n\\n For the moment, they\u0027d maintain the truce.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s almost 2:30 and I\u0027m starved. How about stopping for something to eat?\"\\n\\n Vicki glanced up from Barry\u0027s scribbled directions and gratefully acknowledged the peace offering. \"Only if we eat in the car on the way.\"\\n\\n \"Fine.\" He pulled out onto the street. \"Only if it\u0027s not chicken. In this heat the car\u0027ll suck up the smell of the Colonel and I\u0027ll never be free of it.\"\\n\\n They stopped at the first fast food place they came to. Sitting in the car, eating french fries and waiting for Vicki to get out of the washroom, Celluci\u0027s attention kept wandering to a black and gold jeep parked across the street. He knew he\u0027d seen it before but not where, only that the memory carried vaguely unpleasant connotations.\\n\\n The driver had parked in front of an ancient shoe repair shop. A faded sign in the half of the window Celluci could see proclaimed, You don\u0027t look neat if your shoes are beat. He puzzled over the fragment of memory until the answer walked out of the shop.\\n\\n \"Mark Williams. No wonder I had a bad feeling about it.\" Williams had the kind of attitude Celluci hated. He\u0027d take out-and-out obnoxiousness over superficial charm any day. He grinned around a mouthful of burger. Which certainly explains my relationship with Vicki.\\n\\n Whistling cheerfully, Williams came around to the driver\u0027s side of the jeep, opened the door, and tossed a bulky brown paper package onto the passenger seat before climbing in himself.\\n\\n Had he been in his own jurisdiction, Celluci might have gone over for a chat, just on principle; let the man know he was being watched, try to find out what was in the package. He strongly believed in staying on top of the kind of potential situations Mark Williams represented. As it was, he sat and watched him drive away.\\n\\n With the jeep gone, a second sign became visible in the shoe shop window.\\n\\n Knives sharpened.\\n\\n \"Bertie Reid?\" The middle-aged man sitting behind the desk frowned. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s come in yet but... \" The phone rang and he rolled his eyes as he answered. \"Grove Road Sportsman\u0027s Club. That\u0027s correct, tomorrow night in the pistol range. No, ma\u0027am, there\u0027ll be no shooting while the function is going on. Thank you. Hope to see you there. Damn phones,\" he continued as he hung up. \"Alexander Graham Bell should\u0027ve been given a pair of cement overshoes and dropped off the continental shelf. Now then, where were we?\"\\n\\n \"Bertie Reid,\" Vicki prompted.\\n\\n \"Right.\" He glanced up at the wall clock. \"It\u0027s only just turned three, Bertie\u0027s not likely to be here for another hour. If you don\u0027t mind my askin\u0027, what\u0027s a couple of Toronto PI\u0027s want with Bertie anyway?\"\\n\\n More than a little amused by his assumption that her ID covered Celluci as well, Vicki gave him her best professional smile, designed to install confidence in the general public. \"We\u0027re looking for some information on competition shooting and Barry Wu told us that Ms. Reid was our best bet.\"\\n\\n \"You know Barry?\"\\n\\n \"We make it our business to work closely with the police.\" Celluci had no problem with being perceived as Vicki\u0027s partner. Better that than flashing his badge all over London - behavior guaranteed to be unpopular with his superiors in Toronto.\\n\\n \"And so do we.\" His voice grew defensive. \"Gun club members take responsibility for their weapons. Every piece of equipment that comes into this place is registered with both the OPP and local police and we keep no ammunition on the premises. It\u0027s the assholes who think a gun is a high-powered pecker extension - begging your pardon - who start blasting away in restaurants and school yards or who accidentally blow away Uncle Ralph while showing off their new .30 caliber toy, not our people.\"\\n\\n \"Not that it\u0027s better to be shot on purpose than by accident,\" Vicki pointed out acerbically. Still, she acknowledged his point. If the entire concept of firearms couldn\u0027t be stuffed back into Pandora\u0027s box, better the glamour be removed and they become just another tool or hobby. Personally, however, she\u0027d prefer worldwide gun control legislation so tight that everyone from manufacturers to consumers would give up rather than face the paperwork, and the punishment for the use of a gun while committing a crime would fit the crime... and they could use the bastard\u0027s own weapon then bury it with the body. She\u0027d developed this philosophy when she saw what a twelve gauge shotgun at close range could do to the body of a seven-year-old boy.\\n\\n \"Do you mind if we wait for Ms. Reid to arrive?\" Celluci asked, before the man at the desk could decide if Vicki\u0027s words had been agreement or attack. He figured he\u0027d already gone through his allotment of impassioned diatribes for the day.\\n\\n Frowning slightly, the man shrugged. \"I guess it won\u0027t hurt if Barry sent you. He\u0027s the club\u0027s pride and joy, you know; nobody around here comes close to being in his league. He\u0027ll be going to the next Olympics and, if there\u0027s any justice in the world, coming back with gold. Damn!\" As he reached for the phone, he motioned toward the stairs. \"Clubroom\u0027s on the second floor, you can wait for Bertie up there.\"\\n\\n The clubroom had been furnished with a number of brown or gold institutional sofas and chairs, a couple of good sized tables, and a trophy case. A small kitchen in one corner held a large coffee urn, a few jars of instant coffee, an electric kettle and four teapots in varying sizes. The room\u0027s only inhabitant at 3:00 on a Monday afternoon was a small gray cat curled up on a copy of the Shooter\u0027s Bible who looked up as Vicki and Celluci came in then pointedly ignored them.\\n\\n From behind the large windows in the north wall came the sound of rifle fire.\\n\\n Celluci glanced outside then picked up a pair of binoculars from one of the tables and pointed them down-range at the targets. \"Unless they\u0027re cleverly trying to throw us off the trail,\" he said a moment later passing them to Vicki, \"neither of these two are the marksman we\u0027re looking for.\"\\n\\n Vicki set the binoculars back on the table without bothering to use them. \"Look, Celluci, there\u0027s no reason for both of us to be stuck here until four. Why don\u0027t you swing around by Dr. Dixon\u0027s, take the twins and their father home, and then come back and pick me up.\"\\n\\n \"While you do what?\"\\n\\n \"Ask a few questions around the club then talk to Bertie. Nothing you\u0027d need to baby-sit me during.\"\\n\\n \"Are you trying to get rid of me?\" he asked, leaning back against the cinder block wall.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to be considerate.\" She watched him fold his arms and stifled a sigh. \"Look, I know how much you hate waiting for things and I doubt there\u0027s enough going on around here to keep both of us busy for an hour.\"\\n\\n As much as he disliked admitting it, she had a point. \"We could talk,\" he suggested warily.\\n\\n Vicki shook her head. Another talk with Michael Celluci was the last thing she needed right now. \"When it\u0027s over, we\u0027ll talk.\"\\n\\n He reached out and pushed her glasses up her nose. \"I\u0027ll hold you to that.\" It sounded more like a threat than a promise. \"Call the farm when you want me to start back. No point in me arriving in the middle of things.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Mike.\"\\n\\n \"No problem.\"\\n\\n \"Now why did I do that?\" she wondered once she had the clubroom to herself. \"I know exactly what he\u0027s going to do.\" The chairs were more comfortable than they looked and she sank gratefully into the gold velour. \"He only agreed to go so he could pump the wer about Henry without me around to interfere.\" Did she want him to find out about Henry?\\n\\n \"He\u0027s already been searching into Henry\u0027s background,\" she told the cat. \"Better he finds out under controlled conditions than by accident.\"\\n\\n It was a perfectly plausible reason and Vicki decided to believe it. She only hoped Henry would. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-trail-vicki-nelson-2/page-12.html","bookId":2465,"book":{"id":2465,"title":"Blood Trail (Vicki Nelson #2)","description":"Storyline: Blood Trail (Vicki Nelson #2) \\n For centuries, the werewolves of Toronto have managed to live in peace and tranquility, hidden quietly away on their London, Ontario farm.
