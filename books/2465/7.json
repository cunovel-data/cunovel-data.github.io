{"id":81832,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"These are our south fields, this is the conservation area, Mr. Kleinbein lives here, and here\u0027s old man Biehn\u0027s place.\" Peter squinted down at his sketch, then dragged another three lines into the dirt. \"These are the roads.\"\n \"The Old School Road\u0027s crooked,\" Rose pointed out, leaning over his shoulder.\n \"There\u0027s a rock in the way.\"\n \"So do it here... \" She suited the action to the words, smoothing her palm over his road and drawing in a new one with her fingertip. \"... and you avoid the rock.\"\n Peter snorted. \"Then it\u0027s at the wrong angle.\"\n \"Not really. It still goes from the corner down... \"\n \"Down the wrong way,\" her brother interrupted.\n \"Does not!\"\n \"Does so!\"\n They both had lips and fingers stained with berry juices and Vicki marveled at how easily they could switch from adults to children and back again. She\u0027d decided on the drive back from Mr. Kleinbein\u0027s - who had parted from her with a \"wink, wink, nudge, nudge\" adjuration to keep her eyes open - not to tell them about the local belief that they were nudists. She hadn\u0027t quite decided whether or nor she was going to mention it to their Uncle Stuart; mostly because she doubted he\u0027d care.\n \"You\u0027ve got to bring the crossroads up here!\"\n \"Do not.\"\n \"Do so!\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Vicki told them, stopping the argument cold. The wer, she\u0027d realized while watching them draw the neighborhood on a bald patch of lawn, had very little sense of mapping. Although they probably knew every bush and every fence post on their own territory, the dimensions Peter had drawn were not the dimensions Vicki remembered. She frowned and pushed her glasses back up her nose. \"As near as I can tell, here\u0027s the tree. And here\u0027s where I ended up coming out of the woods.\"\n \"But why didn\u0027t you just follow your back trail?\" Rose asked, still confused on that point despite explanations.\n Vicki sighed. The wer also had a little trouble dealing with the concept of getting lost.\n Before they could reopen the subject of noses, a small black head shoved itself under Vicki\u0027s hand as Shadow crept forward, trying to get a better look at what was going on.\n Peter grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and hauled him back. \"Get out of there you, you\u0027ll mess it up.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s all right.\" Vicki stood, dusting off the seat of her shorts. The grass on the lawn was sparse and bare dusty patches were common. \"I think I\u0027ve seen as much as I can here.\" She should be inside making phone calls; this really wasn\u0027t helping.\n Shadow squirmed in his cousin\u0027s grasp and, when Peter released him, turned into a very excited small boy. \"Show Vicki your trick, Peter!\"\n Under his tan, Peter turned a little red. \"I don\u0027t think she wants to see it, kiddo.\"\n \"Yes she does!\" Daniel bounced over to Vicki. \"You do, don\u0027t you?\"\n She didn\u0027t, but how could she say no in the face of such determined enthusiasm? \"Sure I do.\"\n He bounced back over to Peter. \"See!\"\n Peter sighed and surrendered. \"All right,\" he reached out and tugged at the lock of hair falling into Daniel\u0027s eyes. \"Go and get it.\"\n Barking shrilly, Shadow raced off to the front of the house.\n \"Is he talking when he does that?\" Vicki wondered aloud.\n \"Not really.\" Rose\u0027s ears pricked forward toward the sound. \"Fur-form noises are kind of emoting out loud.\"\n \"So Shadow\u0027s barking translates into \u0027Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy\u0027?\"\n The twins looked at each other and laughed. \"Close enough,\" Rose admitted.\n Shadow raced back silently, but only, Vicki suspected, because the huge yellow frisbee he carried made barking impossible. He dropped it at Peter\u0027s feet - it looked more than a little chewed - and sat back, panting expectantly.\n Peter skimmed out of his shorts and scooped up the plastic disk. \"You ready?\" he asked.\n The entire back end of Shadow\u0027s body wagged.\n Looking not unlike an ancient Greek discus thrower, Peter whipped the frisbee into the air. Shadow took off after it and a heartbeat later so did Storm. Muscles rippling under his russet coat, he raced past the smaller wer, drew his hindquarters under and flung himself into the air, jaws spread, ready to clamp his teeth down on the rim of the disk.\n Only to have it snatched out of his grasp by a larger black wer who hit the ground running with both Storm and Shadow in hot pursuit.\n Rose giggled, thrust her sundress into Vicki\u0027s hands and Cloud took off after them. They raced around the yard for a moment or two then, working as a team, Cloud and Storm cut the larger wer off and jumped it. Shadow, still barking whenever he managed to find a spare breath, threw himself on the mix of tumbling bodies.\n A moment later, Nadine looked up out of the pile of multicolored fur, tossed the frisbee to one side and grinned at Vicki. \"So, you about ready for lunch?\"\n \"We found tracks, not five hundred yards from the house.\" The words were almost an unintelligible growl. The silence that followed them took only a few seconds to fill with answering anger.\n Nadine crossed the kitchen and clutched at her mate\u0027s arm. \"Whose?\" she demanded. \"Whose tracks?\"\n \"We don\u0027t know.\"\n \"But the scent... \"\n \"Garlic. The trail reeks of nothing but garlic.\"\n \"How old?\" Peter wanted to know.\n \"Twelve hours. Maybe a little more. Maybe a little less.\" Stuart\u0027s hair was up and he couldn\u0027t remain still, pacing back and forth with jerky steps.\n If Ebon had been shot from that tree in the woods, as all evidence seemed to suggest he had, five hundred yards and twelve hours meant the assassin had come within range of the house sometime last night.\n \"Maybe you\u0027d all better stay at a hotel, in town, until this is over,\" Vicki suggested, knowing even as the words left her mouth what the reaction was going to be.\n \"No!\" Stuart snapped, turning on her. \"This is our territory and we will defend it!\"\n \"He\u0027s not after your territory,\" Vicki pointed out, her own voice rising. \"He\u0027s after your lives! Take them out of his range, just for a time. It\u0027s the only sensible thing to do!\"\n \"We will not run.\"\n \"But if he can get that close, you can\u0027t protect yourselves from him.\"\n Stuart\u0027s eyes narrowed and his words were nearly lost in his snarl. \"It will not happen again.\"\n \"How do you propose to stop it?\" This was worse than arguing with Celluci.\n \"We will guard... \"\n \"You haven\u0027t been guarding!\"\n \"He has not been on our territory before!\"\n Vicki took a deep breath. This was getting nowhere fast. \"At least send the children away.\"\n \"NO!\"\n Stuart\u0027s response was explosive and Vicki turned to Nadine for help. Surely she\u0027d understand the necessity of sending the children to safety.\n \"The children must stay within the safety of the pack.\" Nadine held a solemn looking Daniel very tightly, one hand stroking his hair. Daniel, in turn, held tight to his mother.\n \"This coward with a gun does not run this pack.\" Stuart yanked his chair out from the table and threw himself down on it. \"And his actions will not rule this pack. We will live as we live.\" He jabbed his finger at Vicki. \"You will find him!\"\n He wasn\u0027t angry at her, Vicki realized, but at himself, at his perceived failure to protect his family. Even so, the heat of his gaze forced her to look away. \"I will find him,\" she said, trying not to resent the strength of his rage. Let\u0027s just hope I find him in time.\n Lunch began as an assault; meat ripped and torn between gleaming teeth, an obvious surrogate for an enemy\u0027s throat. Fortunately for Vicki\u0027s piece of mind, things calmed down fairly quickly, the wer - especially the younger wer - being incapable of sustaining a mood for any length of time when distracted by the more immediate concerns of who forgot to take the butter out of the fridge and just where exactly was the salt.\n The entire family ate in human form, more or less in human style.\n \"It makes it easier on the kids when they go back to school,\" Nadine explained, putting Daniel\u0027s fork into his hand and suggesting that he use it.\n The cold mutton accompanying the salad was greasy and not particularly palatable, but Vicki was so relieved it was cooked that she ate it gladly.\n \"Ms. Nelson went to see Carl Biehn this morning,\" Peter announced suddenly.\n \"Carl Biehn?\" Donald glanced over at Stuart, whose ears had gone back again, then at Vicki. \"Why?\"\n \"It\u0027s important I talk to the neighbors,\" Vicki explained, shooting a look of her own at the dominant male. \"I need to know what they might have seen.\"\n \"He hasn\u0027t been around here for years,\" Nadine said emphatically. \"Not since Stuart ran him off for frightening the girls. Jennifer had nightmares about his God for months.\"\n Stuart snorted. \"God. He wouldn\u0027t know a real God if it bit him on the butt. Old fool\u0027s a grasseater.\"\n Vicki blinked. \"What?\"\n \"Vegetarian,\" Rose translated.\n \"Did he tell you that?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t have to.\" Stuart cracked a bone and sucked out the marrow. \"He smells like a grasseater.\"\n Donald tossed a heel of bread onto the table and dusted his hands off against his bare thighs. \"He stopped me in town once and pointed out the evils of giving life to animals only to kill them.\"\n \"He did it to me once too but I pointed out that killing animals was easier than eating them alive.\" Peter tossed a radish up into the air, caught it between his teeth, and crunched down with the maximum possible noise.\n \"Like majorly gross, Peter!\" Jennifer made a disgusted face at her cousin, who only grinned and continued devouring his lunch.\n \"You don\u0027t think it\u0027s old man Biehn, do you, Vicki?\" Rose asked quietly, pitching her voice under the general noise level around the table.\n Did she? Living so close, Carl Biehn had opportunity to both accidentally discover the wers\u0027 secret and access the tree the shots had come from. He was in good physical condition for a man his age and deeply held religious beliefs were historically a tried and true motive for murder. He had, however, expressed an abhorrence for killing that Vicki believed and, besides a sneaker tread he shared with all and sundry, no evidence linked him to the crimes. The fact that she\u0027d liked him, as subjective as that was, had to be considered. Good cops develop a sensitivity to certain personality types that, no matter how carefully hidden, set off subconscious alarms. Carl Biehn seemed like a decent human being and they were rare.\n On the other hand, the next likeliest suspect was a police officer and Vicki didn\u0027t want to believe that Barry Wu was responsible. She glanced down the table at Colin who, while larger than his uncle and father, was still a small, wiry man and probably wouldn\u0027t have made the force under the old size requirements. He looked like someone had a knife in his heart and was slowly twisting the blade. He hadn\u0027t said two words since he\u0027d sat down.\n Did she think it was old man Biehn? No. Nor did she want to think it was Colin\u0027s partner. Nor could she completely rule either of them out, not until the murderer was found. A great many people had access to the woods, however, and in spite of the statistics, the most obvious suspects didn\u0027t always turn out to be guilty.\n She turned back to Rose, waiting predator patient for an answer.\n \"Until I get more information, I have to suspect everyone, Rose, even Mr. Kleinbein. This is too important not to.\"\n Having cleared the table of anything remotely like food, the wer were rising and going their separate ways. Donald had already changed, padded out to the porch, and collapsed in a dark triangle of shade. Shadow, with permission from his mother, had taken a bone into a corner and, holding it between his front paws, was chewing it into submission.\n Vicki stood as Colin did, but he turned and headed out of the kitchen without acknowledging her in any way.\n \"Colin!\" Even Vicki stiffened at the command in Stuart\u0027s voice and Colin stopped dead, shoulders hunched. \"Vicki wants to talk to you.\"\n Slowly, Colin turned, canines gleaming.\n \"Colin... \" The name was a growl, low and menacing.\n The younger wer hesitated for a moment, then his shoulders dropped and a curt motion of his head indicated Vicki should follow him.\n It was far from gracious, but it would have to do. She fell into step behind him as he started up the stairs.\n \"It\u0027s too hot to walk outside, so we\u0027ll talk in my room,\" he said without turning. \"Then the kids won\u0027t interrupt.\"\n Vicki wasn\u0027t so sure of that, given the wer sense of privacy but, if it made Colin more comfortable, they could talk on the roof for all she cared.\n His room was one of three in the addition built on over the woodshed and the door next to his was the first closed door Vicki had seen in the house.\n \"Henry,\" Colin said by way of explanation as they passed. \"He bolts it from the inside.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a bedroom... \"\n \"No. It\u0027s a storage closet. But it doesn\u0027t have a window, and if we shuffle stuff around there\u0027s room for a cot.\"\n Vicki brushed her palm over the dark wood and wondered if Henry could sense her in the hallway. Wondered what it was like, lying there in the dark.\n \"I haven\u0027t seen the sun in over four hundred years. \"\n She sighed and entered Colin\u0027s room. He threw himself down on the bed, fingers laced behind his head, watching her through narrowed eyes. Despite the outwardly relaxed position, every muscle in his body hummed with tension, ready for fight or flight. Vicki wasn\u0027t sure which, nor did she want to find out.\n \"I used to get the laundry to do mine, too,\" she told him, nodding at the half dozen clean uniform shirts hanging on the closet door, still in their plastic bags. Pushing a pair of sweatpants off a wooden chair, she sat down. \"I had better things to do with my time than iron.\"\n \"So,\" she leaned forward, elbows resting on her knees, \"do you think your partner did it?\" Colin\u0027s eyes narrowed further and his lips drew back but before he could move she added matter-of-factly, \"Or do you want to help me prove he didn\u0027t?\"\n Slowly, his eyes never leaving her face, Colin sat up. Vicki accepted his puzzled scrutiny with her blandest expression and waited. The next line was his. \"You don\u0027t think Barry did it,\" he said at last.\n \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" She rested her chin on her folded hands. \"But I don\u0027t want to believe he did it and you\u0027re the best person to prove he didn\u0027t. For Chrissakes, Colin, start thinking like a cop, not a... a sheepdog.\" He flinched. \"Did he have the opportunity?\"\n For a moment she wasn\u0027t sure he was going to answer her, then he mirrored her position on the edge of the bed and sighed. \"Yeah. We were working days both times it happened. He knows the farm and he knows the conservation area. We got off at eleven last night and he could have easily come out here after shift and made those tracks.\"\n \"Okay, that\u0027s one against, and we know he has the skill... \"\n \"He\u0027s going to the next Olympics, he\u0027s that good. But if he\u0027s casting silver bullets I couldn\u0027t find any evidence of it and, believe me, I looked.\"\n \"Does he have a motive?\"\n Colin shook his head. \"How should I know? If he\u0027s doing it, maybe he\u0027s crazy.\"\n \"Is he?\"\n \"Is he what?\"\n \"Crazy? You spend eight hours a day with the man. If he\u0027s crazy, you should have noticed something.\" She rolled her eyes at his bewildered expression and used her voice like a club. \"Think, damn it! Use your training!\"\n Colin\u0027s ears went back and his breathing sped up but he held himself in check and Vicki could actually see him thinking about it. She was impressed by his control. If a stranger had used that tone on her, she\u0027d have probably done something stupid.\n After a moment, he frowned. \"I wouldn\u0027t swear to this in court,\" he said slowly, \"but I\u0027d bet my life on his sanity.\"\n \"You are betting your life on his sanity,\" Vicki pointed out dryly, \"every time you walk out of the station with him. Now we\u0027ve settled that, why don\u0027t we concentrate on proving he didn\u0027t do it.\"\n \"But... \"\n \"But what?\" Vicki snapped, getting a little tired of Colin\u0027s attitude. She recognized that he was in a terrible position, torn between his family and his partner, but that was no reason to shut off his brain. \"Just tell me about the man.\"\n \"We, uh, we were at the Police College together.\" He ran his hands through his hair, the cropped cut accentuating the point of both chin and ears. \"I wouldn\u0027t even be a cop if it wasn\u0027t for Barry, and I guess he wouldn\u0027t be one if it wasn\u0027t for me. He was the only \u0027visible ethnic minority\u0027 cadet there and I was, well, what I am. We ended up together to survive. When we graduated, we managed to stay together - well, mostly, it\u0027s not like we\u0027re mated or anything... \"\n Vicki wasn\u0027t surprised by Barry\u0027s philosophical reaction to his partner\u0027s actual race. In the \"us against them\" attitude that the job forced police officers to develop, finding out that one of \"us\" was a werewolf could be dealt with, at least on an individual basis. Can I depend on my partner to back me up ? was the crucial question, not, Does my partner bay at the moon? And now that she thought about it, Vicki had known a number of cops who bayed at the moon.\n \"... and the night I got shot... \"\n \"Wait a minute, you what?\"\n Colin shrugged it off. \"We surprised a couple of punks during a holdup. They came out shooting. I took a slug in the leg. It was nothing.\"\n \"Wrong. Very wrong.\" Vicki grinned. \"Barry was there?\"\n \"Course he was.\"\n \"He saw you bleed?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"You probably talked later about dying, about how you thought you were going to be killed?\"\n \"Yeah, but... \"\n \"Why would Barry shoot at the wer with silver bullets - expensive rounds that he\u0027d have to make himself, risking discovery - when he knows that good old lead will do the job?\"\n \"To throw us off his trail?\"\n \"Colin!\" Vicki threw her hands up. \"That would take a crazy person and you\u0027ve already told me Barry is sane. Trust your instincts. At least when you\u0027ve got enough facts to back them up.\"\n Colin opened his mouth, closed it, and then shuddered as if a great weight had been lifted off of him. He leapt to his feet, threw back his head, and howled.\n Vicki, who had pretty much forgotten that he was naked, found herself suddenly made very aware of it. The wer might react sexually to scent and therefore not react at all to humans, but humans had a visually based libido and Vicki\u0027s had just belted her in the crotch.\n Oh, lord, why me? she thought as huge black paws came down on her shoulders and a large pink tongue swept vigorously across her face.\n After Colin had galloped off to confront his pack leader - he needed Stuart\u0027s permission to finally speak to Barry about what had been going on - Vicki spent the early part of the afternoon on the phone, confirming that the game warden had, indeed, been up north since the beginning of August and had, in fact, been there on the two nights of the murders, his location supported by a bar full of witnesses. That done, and his name crossed off her list, she changed her clothes and had Rose and Peter drive her into London.\n Storm spent the entire trip with his head out the window, mouth open, eyes slitted against the wind, ears flat against his skull.\n The membership lists of both bird-watching clubs were relatively easy to get. She merely showed the presidents of each her identification and told them she\u0027d been hired to find a distant relative of a very rich man. \"All I have to go on is that they once lived in the London area and enjoyed bird-watching. There\u0027s a great deal of money involved if I find them.\"\n \"But are you looking for a man or a woman ?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Vicki looked peeved.\n \"He\u0027s lost almost all his marbles and that\u0027s all he can remember. Oh, yes, he mumbled something about this relative being a marksman.\"\n Neither president rose to the bait. If the killer was one of the birders, he or she hadn\u0027t mentioned his or her interest in firearms to the executive of either club. \"You don\u0027t have a third cousin named Anthony Carmaletti, do you?\" Vicki crossed her fingers as she asked. If either of them did have a third cousin named Anthony Carmaletti it was going to blow her rich, dying relative story right out of the water.\n She received one definite no with a twenty minute lecture on genealogy, one \"I\u0027ll ask my mother, can you get back to me tomorrow?\" from an octogenarian, and both lists. And Celluci says I\u0027m a lousy liar. Ha.\n \"Now what?\" Rose asked as she got back into the car after the second stop.\n \"Now, I need the membership list of the photography club, but I doubt the YMCA will just hand it over, and I need the OPP list of registered firearms, which should be a little easier to get... \" Cops tended to cooperate with their own. \"... but right at the moment, I need to talk to Dr. Dixon.\"\n First impressions said Dr. Dixon could not have been the killer. He was a frail old man who wouldn\u0027t have made it to the tree, let alone climbed it carrying a high-powered rifle and scope.\n They had a short but pleasant visit. Dr. Dixon told Vicki embarrassing stories about Rose and Peter when they were children, which the twins paid no attention to as they were busy in the next room decimating his record collection.\n \"Opera,\" the doctor explained when Vicki wondered what was going on. \"Every wer I\u0027ve ever met is crazy about it.\"\n \"Every wer?\" Vicki asked.\n \"Every wer I\u0027ve met,\" he reiterated. \"Stuart\u0027s old pack in Vermont prefers Italian, but they\u0027re close enough to civilization they can afford to be picky. Most of the rest, at least in Canada, particularly the pack just by Algonquin Park and the lot up by Mooseane, are glued to the CBC Sunday afternoons.\"\n \"How many packs are there?\"\n \"Well, I just mentioned four, and there\u0027s at least two up in the Yukon, one in northern Manitoba... \" He frowned. \"How the hell should I know? Enough for genetic diversity. Although at some point they seem to have inbred for opera. Can\u0027t get enough. I lend this lot records and,\" he raised his voice, \"occasionally they bring them back.\"\n \"Next time, Dr. Dixon,\" Peter called. \"We promise.\"\n \"Sure you will,\" he muttered. \"If that damned pup\u0027s been chewing on them again I\u0027ll... \"\n \"Scratch him behind the ears and tell him he\u0027s adorable,\" Rose finished, coming into the room with a half dozen albums under her arm, \"just like you always do.\"\n While they were leaving, Vicki paused on the front step and watched Storm race across the lawn after a butterfly.\n \"What happens when you die?\" she asked the doctor.\n He snorted. \"I rot. Why?\"\n \"I mean, what happens to them? They won\u0027t stop needing a doctor just because you\u0027re gone.\"\n \"When the time is right, I\u0027ll tell the young doctor who took over my practice.\" He laughed suddenly. \"She grew up not knowing if she wanted to be a vet or a GP. The wer should be right up her alley.\"\n \"Don\u0027t wait too long,\" Vicki warned.\n \"Don\u0027t stick that investigating nose of yours in where it doesn\u0027t belong,\" Dr. Dixon shot back. \"I\u0027ve known the Heerkens family for years, longer than you\u0027ve been alive. I have no intention of dropping dead and leaving them to face the world alone.\"\n \"They won\u0027t be alone.\"\n He grinned at her defensive tone, but his voice was soft as he said, \"No, I don\u0027t suppose they will be.\"\n Jennifer and Marie didn\u0027t bother coming in for dinner.\n \"They shared a rabbit about an hour ago,\" Nadine explained, smiling fondly, sadly, out the window at them. They were curled so tightly around each other that it was difficult to see where one fur-form ended and the other began.\n Colin had long since left for work so only the seven of them sat down at the table. Daniel did his best to make up for the missing three.\n After dinner, Vicki worked on her notes - impressions of Carl Biehn, Frederick Kleinbein, the birders, the doctor, the new set of tracks - and then she just sat, attempting to put the day and the day\u0027s discoveries in order. Order kept escaping her, she had a number of bits and pieces but nothing that definitely fit into the pattern. The opera in the background wasn\u0027t a lot of help and the weird harmonics added by her hosts could only be called distracting.\n Actually, Vicki could think of a number of other things to call them, but she went to the pond to watch Shadow hunt frogs instead. Under the circumstances, it seemed safer - not only for Shadow but for herself as well.\n \"Don\u0027t let him eat too many,\" Nadine called over the music as they left, \"or he\u0027ll make himself sick.\"\n \"I\u0027m not at all surprised,\" Vicki muttered, but she ended up letting him eat both frogs he caught. He\u0027d worked so hard at it, bounding this way and that, barking hysterically, that she felt he deserved them.\n Back at the house, dusk seemed to stretch for hours, the crickets and Pavarotti singing duets to the setting sun. Vicki\u0027s vision dimmed and the sound of the wind moving in the trees became the sound of death quietly approaching the house: the tap of two twigs, a rifle bolt drawn back. She knew she was allowing her imagination to overrule common sense even while she waited for the gunshot that would tell her it wasn\u0027t imagination at all. Finally, the darkness drove her to the kitchen table where the hanging bulb surrounded her with a hard edged circle of sight.\n At last, Donald lifted his head and, nostrils flaring, announced, \"Henry\u0027s up.\"\n Vicki pulled her glasses off and rubbed at her eyes. It was about time. You know it\u0027s been a strange day, she mused, when you \u0027re looking forward to the arrival of the bloodsucking undead. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-trail-vicki-nelson-2/page-7.html","bookId":2465,"book":{"id":2465,"title":"Blood Trail (Vicki Nelson #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Trail (Vicki Nelson #2) \n For centuries, the werewolves of Toronto have managed to live in peace and tranquility, hidden quietly away on their London, Ontario farm.
