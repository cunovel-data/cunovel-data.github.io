When she did, her extraordinary chest jiggled in a way that made Cassie certain she wasn\u0027t wearing anything underneath her apricot-colored sweater.\\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t see the point of Jeffrey Lovejoy,\" the biker girl said, scowling.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t see the point of any guy, Deborah; that\u0027s your problem,\" said Suzan.\\n\\n \"And your problem is that you can\u0027t see the point of anything else,\" Deborah retorted. \"But Jeffrey\u0027s worse than most. He\u0027s got more teeth than brain cells.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t his teeth I\u0027m interested in,\" said Faye thoughtfully. \"Who are you going to start with, Suzan?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s so hard to decide. There\u0027s Mark Flemming and Brant Hegerwood and David Downey - he\u0027s in my remedial English class, and he\u0027s developed this killer body over the summer. And then there\u0027s always Nick...\"\\n\\n Deborah hooted. \"Our Nick? The only way he\u0027d look at you is if you had four wheels and a clutch.\"\\n\\n \"And besides, he\u0027s taken,\" Faye said, and her smile reminded Cassie of a crouching jungle cat.\\n\\n \"You just said you wanted Jeffrey - \"\\n\\n \"They both have their uses. Get this straight, Suzan. Nick and I have an... arrangement. So you just back off and pick yourself a nice outsider, all right?\"\\n\\n There was a moment of tension, and then the strawberry blond shrugged. \"Okay, I\u0027ll take David Downey. I didn\u0027t really want Nick anyway. He\u0027s an iguana.\"\\n\\n Deborah looked up. \"He\u0027s my cousin!\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s still an iguana. He kissed me at the junior prom, and it was like kissing a reptile.\"\\n\\n \"Can we get back to business?\" Faye said. \"Who\u0027s on the hate list?\"\\n\\n \"Sally Waltman,\" Suzan said immediately.\\n\\n \"She already thinks because she\u0027s class president she can stand up to us, and if you take Jeffrey, she\u0027s going to be really mad.\"\\n\\n \"Sally...\" Fay mused. \"Yes, we\u0027ll have to come up with something truly special for dear old Sally... What\u0027s wrong, Deborah?\"\\n\\n Deborah had stiffened, looking up the hill toward the school entrance. \"Intruder alert,\" she said. \"In fact, it looks like a whole delegation.\"\\n\\n Cassie had seen it too, a group of guys and girls coming through the main entrance down the hill. She felt a surge of hope. Maybe while Faye and the other two were occupied with them, she herself could slip away unnoticed. Heart beating quickly, she watched the new group approach.\\n\\n A broad-shouldered boy in front, who seemed to be the leader, spoke up.\\n\\n \"Look, Faye, the cafeteria\u0027s crowded. So we\u0027re going to eat out here - okay?\" His voice started out belligerent, but it wavered toward the end, becoming more of a question than a statement.\\n\\n Faye looked up at him without haste, then smiled her slow, beautiful smile. \"No,\" she said, briefly and sweetly. \"It isn\u0027t okay.\" Then she turned back to her lunch.\\n\\n \"How come?\" the boy burst out, still trying to sound tough. \"You didn\u0027t stop us last year.\"\\n\\n \"Last year,\" Faye said, \"we were only juniors. This year we\u0027re seniors - and we\u0027re wicked. As wicked as we wanna be.\"\\n\\n Deborah and Suzan smiled.\\n\\n Frustrated, Cassie shifted her weight. So far there had never been a moment when all three of the girls were looking away. Come on, turn around, she thought pleadingly.\\n\\n The group of guys and girls went on standing there for a minute or two, exchanging angry glances. But finally they turned and walked back toward the school building - all except one.\\n\\n \"Uh, Faye? Did you mean I had to go too?\" she said. She was a pretty, flushed girl, and young. Probably a sophomore, Cassie guessed. Cassie expected her to get packed off like the others, but to her surprise Faye raised her eyebrows and then patted the landing invitingly.\\n\\n \"Why, Kori,\" she said, \"of course you can stay. We just imagined you\u0027d be eating in the cafeteria with the Princess of Purity and the rest of the goody-goodies.\"\\n\\n Kori sat down. \"Too much goodness can get boring,\" she said.\\n\\n Faye tilted her head and smiled. \"And there I thought you were a namby-pamby little Puritan. Silly me,\" she said. \"Well, you know you\u0027re always welcome here. You\u0027re almost one of us, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Kori ducked her head. \"I\u0027ll be fifteen in two weeks.\"\\n\\n \"There, you see,\" Faye said to the others. \"She\u0027s almost eligible. Now what were we talking about? That new slasher movie, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Deborah said, showing her teeth. \"The one where the guy chops people up and makes them into condiments at his salad bar.\"\\n\\n Suzan was unwrapping a Twinkie. \"Oh, Deborah, don\u0027t. You\u0027re making me sick.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you make me sick with those things,\" Deborah said. \"You never stop eating them. That\u0027s what those are, you know,\" she told Kori, pointing at Suzan\u0027s chest. \"Two giant Twinkies. If Hostess went out of business, she\u0027d be wearing a double A.\"\\n\\n Faye laughed her sleepy, throaty laugh, and even Suzan giggled. Kori was smiling too, but looking uncomfortable.\\n\\n \"Kori! We\u0027re not embarrassing you, are we?\" Faye exclaimed, opening her golden eyes wide.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be silly. I don\u0027t embarrass easily,\" Kori said.\\n\\n \"Well, with brothers like yours, I should think not. Still,\" Faye went on, \"you seem so young, you know; almost... virginal. But that\u0027s probably just a false impression, right?\"\\n\\n Kori was blushing now. All three senior girls were looking at her with insinuating smiles.\\n\\n \"Well, sure - I mean, it is a false impression - I\u0027m not all that young - \" Kori swallowed, looking confused. \"I went out with Jimmy Clark all last summer,\" she ended defensively.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell us all about it?\" Faye murmured. Kori looked more confused.\\n\\n \"I - well - I think I\u0027d better get going. I\u0027ve got gym next period, and I have to get all the way over to E-wing. I\u0027ll see you guys.\" She got up quickly and disappeared.\\n\\n \"Strange, she left her lunch,\" Faye mused, frowning gently. \"Oh, well.\" She extracted a package of cupcakes from Kori\u0027s lunch sack and tossed them to Suzan, who giggled.\\n\\n Deborah, though, was frowning. \"That was stupid, Faye. We\u0027re going to need her later - like in two weeks. One empty space, one candidate, you know?\"\\n\\n \"True,\" Faye said. \"Oh, well, I\u0027ll make it up to her. Don\u0027t worry; when the time comes, she\u0027ll be on our side.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose we\u0027d better get moving too,\" Suzan said, and behind her rock, Cassie shut her eyes in relief. \"I\u0027ve got to climb all the way to the third floor for algebra.\"\\n\\n \"Which could take hours,\" Deborah said maliciously. \"But don\u0027t strain yourself just yet. There\u0027s more company coming.\"\\n\\n Faye sighed in exasperation, without turning. \"Who now?. What do we have to do to get a little peace around here?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Madame Class President herself. Sally. And there\u0027s steam coming out of her ears.\"\\n\\n Faye\u0027s expression of annoyance vanished, dissolving into something more beautiful and infinitely more dangerous. Still sitting with her back to the school, she smiled and worked her long, red-tipped fingers like a cat exercising its claws. \"And I thought today was going to be boring,\" she murmured, clucking her tongue. \"It just shows you can never tell. Well, hetto, Sally,\" she said aloud, standing and turning in one smooth motion. \"What a lovely surprise. How was your summer?\"\\n\\n \"Save it, Faye,\" said the girl who\u0027d just marched down the steps. She was a good head shorter than Faye, and slighter of build, but her arms and legs had a wiry look and her fists were clenched as if she were prepared to do physical battle. \"I didn\u0027t come out here to chat.\"\\n\\n \"But we haven\u0027t had a good talk in so long... Did you do something to your hair? It\u0027s so - interesting.\"\\n\\n Cassie looked at Sally\u0027s hair. It had a rusty cast to it, and looked frizzled and overpermed.\\n\\n As the girl raised a defensive hand to her head Cassie could almost have giggled - if it all hadn\u0027t been so horrible.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t come to talk about my hair, either!\" snapped Sally. She had a strident voice that was climbing higher with every sentence. \"I came to talk about Jeffrey. You leave him alone!\"\\n\\n Faye smiled, very slowly. \"Why?\" she murmured, and in contrast to Sally\u0027s voice hers seemed even lower and more sensual. \"Afraid of what he\u0027ll do if you\u0027re not there to hold his hand?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not interested in you!\"\\n\\n \"Is that what he told you? Hmm. He seemed very interested this morning. He\u0027s taking me out Saturday night.\"\\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re making him.\"\\n\\n \"Making him? Are you suggesting a big boy like Jeffrey can\u0027t say no when he wants to?\" Faye shook her head. \"And why isn\u0027t he here now to speak for himself? I\u0027ll tell you something, Sally,\" she added, her voice dropping confidentially. \"He didn\u0027t fight hard this morning. He didn\u0027t fight hard at all.\"\\n\\n Sally\u0027s hand drew back as if she wanted to hit the bigger girl, but she didn\u0027t. \"You think you can do anything, Faye - you and the rest of the Club! Well, it\u0027s time somebody showed you that you can\u0027t. There are more of us - lots more - and we\u0027re getting tired of being pushed around. It\u0027s time somebody took a stand.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what you\u0027re planning to do?\" Faye said pleasantly. Sally had been circling her like a bulldog looking for an opening, and now the wiry girl had ended on the edge of the landing with her back to the steps leading down.\\n\\n \"Yes!\" Sally cried defiantly.\\n\\n \"Funny,\" murmured Faye, \"because it\u0027s going to be hard to do that flat on your back.\" With the last words she flicked her long red fingernails in Sally\u0027s face.\\n\\n She never actually touched Sally\u0027s skin. Cassie, who had been watching intently, desperately waiting for an opportunity to flee, felt sure of that.\\n\\n But it was as if something hit Sally. Something invisible. And heavy. The wiry girl\u0027s entire body jerked back and she tried frantically to regain her footing on the edge of the landing. Arms flailing, she teetered for an endless instant and then fell backward.\\n\\n Cassie could never remember what happened then. One minute she was behind her rock, crouching and safe, and the next she had flung herself out across the falling girl\u0027s path, knocking her sideways onto the grass. For a heartbeat Cassie thought they were both going to roll all the way down the hill, but somehow or other they didn\u0027t. They ended up in a heap, with Cassie underneath.\\n\\n \"Let go! You ripped my shirt,\" a strident voice exclaimed, and an unkind fist planted itself in Cassie\u0027s midriff as Sally pushed herself to her feet. Cassie stared up at her, open-mouthed. Talk about gratitude...\\n\\n \"And as for you, Faye Chamberlain - you tried to kill me! But you\u0027ll get yours, you wait and see!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get yours too, Sally,\" Faye promised, smiling, but the sleepiness in her smile wasn\u0027t genuine anymore. She looked as if underneath she were grinding her teeth.\\n\\n \"You just wait,\" Sally repeated vehemently. \"Someday they may find you at the bottom of those stairs with a broken neck.\" With that, she marched to the landing and up the steps, bringing her foot down on each as if she were stamping on Faye\u0027s face. She didn\u0027t even look back or acknowledge Cassie\u0027s existence.\\n\\n Cassie slowly got up and glanced down the long, winding flight of stairs that led to the foot of the hill. She couldn\u0027t have done anything differently, she realized. Sally would have been lucky to break nothing more than her neck before she reached bottom. But now...\\n\\n She turned to face the three senior girls above her.\\n\\n They were still standing with careless, unstudied elegance, but underneath their easy demeanor was violence. Cassie saw it in the sullen darkness of Deborah\u0027s eyes, and in the spiteful curve of Suzan\u0027s lips. But most of all she saw it in Faye.\\n\\n It occurred to her, quite incidentally, that these were probably the three most beautiful girls she\u0027d ever seen. It wasn\u0027t just that each had perfect skin, free of the slightest trace of teenage blemishes. It wasn\u0027t their gorgeous hair: Deborah\u0027s dark disordered curls, Faye\u0027s pitch-black mane, and Suzan\u0027s cloud of reddish gold. It wasn\u0027t even the way they set each other off, each one\u0027s distinctive type enhancing the others\u0027 instead of detracting from them. It was something else, something that came from within. A kind of confidence and self-possession that no girl at sixteen or seventeen should have. An inner strength, an energy. A power.\\n\\n It terrified her.\\n\\n \"Well, now, what do we have here?\" Faye said in a throaty voice. \"A spy? Or a little white mouse?\"\\n\\n Run, Cassie thought. But her legs wouldn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \"I saw her this morning,\" Deborah said. \"She was hanging out in front of the bike rack, staring at me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve seen her before that, Debby,\" Faye replied. \"I saw her last week at Number Twelve. She\u0027s a neighbor.\"\\n\\n \"You mean she\u0027s - \" Suzan broke off.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever else she is, she\u0027s dead meat now,\" Deborah said. Her petite face was twisted in a scowl.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s not be hasty,\" Faye murmured. \"Even mice may have their uses. By the way, how long were you hiding there?\"\\n\\n There was only one answer to this, and Cassie fought not to say it. This was no time to come up with a devastatingly witty remark. But at last she gave in, because it was the truth, and because she couldn\u0027t think of anything else.\\n\\n \"Long enough,\" she said, and shut her eyes in misery.\\n\\n Faye descended slowly to stand in front of her. \"Do you always spy on other people\u0027s private conversations?\"\\n\\n \"I was here before you came,\" Cassie said, with as much spirit as she could manage. If only Faye would stop staring at her like that. Those honey-colored eyes seemed to glow with an eerie, supernatural light. It was focused on Cassie like a laser beam, draining away her will, causing the strength to flow out of her. It was as if Faye wanted her to do something - or wanted something from her. It made her feel so disoriented - so off balance and weak...\\n\\n And then she felt a sudden surge of strength that seemed to come up from her feet. Or, rather, from the ground beneath them, from the red New England granite that she\u0027d felt buzzing with life earlier. It steadied her, sweeping up and straightening her spine, so that she lifted her chin and looked into those golden eyes without flinching.\\n\\n \"I was here first,\" she said defiantly.\\n\\n \"Very good,\" murmured Faye, and there was an odd look in her eyes. Then she turned her head. \"Anything interesting in her backpack?\"\\n\\n Cassie saw, to her outrage, that Deborah was going through her backpack, throwing things out one by one. \"Not much,\" the biker said, tossing it on the ground so the rest of its contents scattered down the hillside.\\n\\n \"All right.\" Faye was smiling again, a particularly unpleasant smile that made her red lips look cruel. \"I think you were right the first time, Deborah. She\u0027s dead meat.\" She looked at Cassie. \"You\u0027re new here, so you probably don\u0027t understand what kind of mistake you\u0027ve made. And I don\u0027t have time to stand here and tell you. But you\u0027ll find out. You\u0027ll find out - Cassie.\"\\n\\n She reached out and caught Cassie\u0027s chin with long, red-tipped fingers. Cassie wanted to pull away, but her muscles were locked. She felt the strength in those fingers and the hardness of the long, slightly curving nails. Like talons, she thought. The talons of a bird of prey.\\n\\n For the first time she noticed that the red stone Fay wore at her throat had a star in it, like a star sapphire. It winked in the sunlight, and Cassie found she couldn\u0027t take her eyes off it.\\n\\n Laughing suddenly, Faye released her.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" she said to the other two girls. The three of them turned and went up the steps.\\n\\n The air exploded from Cassie\u0027s lungs as if she were a balloon that had just been pricked. She was shaking inside. That had been... That had been absolutely...\\n\\n Get a grip on yourself!\\n\\n She\u0027s only a teenage gang leader, she told herself. At least the mystery of the Club is solved. They\u0027re a gang. You\u0027ve heard of gangs before, even if you never went to a school with one. As long as you leave them alone and don\u0027t cross them from now on, you\u0027ll be okay.\\n\\n But the reassurance rang hollow in her mind. Faye\u0027s last words had sounded like a threat. But a threat of what?\\n\\n When Cassie got back to the house that afternoon, her mother didn\u0027t seem to be downstairs. Finally, as she wandered from room to room calling, her grandmother appeared on the staircase. The look on her face made Cassie\u0027s stomach lurch.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong? Where\u0027s Mom?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s upstairs, in her room. She hasn\u0027t been feeling very well. Now, there\u0027s no need for you to get worried...\"\\n\\n Cassie hurried up the creaking old steps to the green room. Her mother was lying in a grand four-poster bed. Her eyes were shut, her face pale and lightly perspiring.\\n\\n \"Mom?\"\\n\\n The large black eyes opened. Her mother swallowed and smiled painfully. \"Just a touch of the flu, I think,\" she said, and her voice was weak and distant, a voice to go with the pallor of her face. \"I\u0027ll be fine in a day or two, sweetheart. How was school?\"\\n\\n Cassie\u0027s better nature battled with her desire to spread her own misery around as much as possible. Her mother took a little breath and shut her eyes as if the light hurt her.\\n\\n Better nature won. Cassie dug her nails into her palms and spoke evenly. \"Oh, fine,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Did you meet anyone interesting?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you could say that.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t want to worry her grandmother, either. But during dinner, when her grand-mother asked why she was so quiet, the words just seemed to come out by themselves.\\n\\n \"There was this girl at school - her name\u0027s Faye, and she\u0027s awful. A female Attila the Hun. And on my very first day I ended up making her hate me...\" She told the whole story. At the end of it, her grandmother looked into the fireplace as if preoccupied.\\n\\n \"It will get better, Cassie,\" she said.\\n\\n But what if it doesn\u0027t? Cassie thought. \"Oh, I\u0027m sure it will,\" she said.\\n\\n Then her grandmother did something surprising. She looked around as if somebody might be listening and then leaned forward. \"No, I mean that, Cassie. I know. You see, you have - a special advantage. Something very special...\" Her voice dropped to a whisper.\\n\\n Cassie leaned forward in turn. \"What?\"\\n\\n Her grandmother opened her mouth, then her eyes shifted away. There was a pop from the fire, and she got up to poke the wood there.\\n\\n \"Grandma, what?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll find out.\"\\n\\n Cassie felt a shock. It was the second time today she\u0027d heard those words. \"Grandma - \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got good sense, for one thing,\" her grandmother said, a new, brisk tone in her voice. \"And two good legs, for another. Here, take this broth up to your mother. She hasn\u0027t eaten anything all day.\"\\n\\n That night, Cassie couldn\u0027t sleep. Either her dread kept her awake so that she noticed more of the creaking, rattling, old-house sounds than she had before, or there were more of the sounds to notice. She didn\u0027t know which, and it didn\u0027t matter: she kept falling asleep and then jerking back to awareness. Every so often she reached under her pillow to touch the chalcedony piece. If only she could really sleep... so she could dream about him...\\n\\n She sat bolt upright in bed.\\n\\n Then she got up, bare feet pattering on the hardwood floor, and went over to unzip her backpack. She took the things she\u0027d re-collected from the hillside out one by one, pencil by pencil, book by book. At last she looked at the array on the bedspread.\\n\\n She was right. She hadn\u0027t noticed it at the time; she\u0027d been too worried about Faye\u0027s threat. But the poem she\u0027d written that morning and then crumpled up in anger was missing.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-initiation-the-secret-circle-1/page-6.html","bookId":2095,"book":{"id":2095,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Initiation (The Secret Circle #1)","description":"Storyline: The Secret Circle book 1: The Initiation \\n The Circle\u0027s Power has Lured Her Home...
