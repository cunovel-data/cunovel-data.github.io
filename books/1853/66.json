{"id":79486,"no":66,"title":"Page 66","content":"\"I have noo-noo-cows, Greg, can you milk me?\" \"They\u0027re called ni**les, Gavin.\" Honesty is the best policy. Let\u0027s go with that. He sat there for a few minutes not saying anything. I was mentally patting myself on the back for being a good parent and being able to be truthful with my son. \"Nipples,\" he said softly. I nodded my head, proud that he had no problem using the big-people word and not something silly. I still had nightmares about the fact that my father called a vagina a choo-choo-laney when I was growing up. \"Nipples, ni**les, ni**les. That\u0027s fun to say!\" Shit. I may have spoken too soon. He jumped down off of the bed and ran out of my room, singing \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\" but replaced each and every word with \"nipple.\" 17. Duct Tape for the Win Trojan, Durex, Lifestyles, Trojan Magnum (oh yeah, my three foot c**k definitely needed those), Contempo, Vivid and Rough Rider. Seriously? There was a condom brand called Rough Rider? Why not just go with Fuck Her Hard and be done with it? I stood in the \"Family Planning\" aisle of the grocery store, trying to decide which condom brand was more effective. Family Planning…give me a break. How many people came to this aisle because they were planning a family? They came to this aisle to AVOID planning a family. I couldn\u0027t buy Trojan. Every time I opened the box I heard that god damn jingle from the commercial, \"Trojan Man!\" and then I thought of a guy on a horse. Durex made me think of Playtex which made me think of tampons, which made me think of periods, which made me want to dry heave. Lifestyles made me think of Robin Leach and caviar. Fish eggs were not sexy and neither was Robin Leach. I wasn\u0027t going to make myself look like a major ass**le and buy Trojan Magnum. If I bought those things, I\u0027d have to talk like Dirty Hairy in the bedroom. \"Do you feel lucky today, seeing my giant penis, punk?\" Claire probably wouldn\u0027t take too kindly to me calling her a punk before I had sex with her. Contempo just sounded boring, like contemporary music, John Tesh or some shit like that. Snooze fest. If people fell asleep while you were having sex with them, you needed to get your shit together. Rough Rider was already out so that left me with Vivid. Vivid video was a p**n making company. And the things I wanted to do to Claire could definitely be in p**n . I think dressing up like a FedEx guy so I could deliver my big package to the horny housewife while she bent over the kitchen sink may have to wait at least a few weeks though. I grabbed the forty-eight count bulk box that came with a free bottle of KY Warming Liquid and a vibrating c**k ring and threw them in the cart. The c**k ring scared me just a little. The idea of something vibrating by my balls made me nervous. What if it short-circuited? Great Balls of Fire didn\u0027t need to occur in the bedroom. And the smell of burning nut hair was sure to kill the mood. \"Stop worrying. I\u0027m sure Claire isn\u0027t going to even notice that you have a tiny tallywhacker.\" I turned around to see Jim standing in the aisle with a smirk and a box of tampons in his hand. \"Very funny, ass**le. Looks like you\u0027re on the rag this week. Make sure to get yourself some Midol and a copy of Terms of Endearment so you can have yourself a good cry,\" I quipped. \"Hey, Terms of Endearment is a very touching, beautiful story about the dynamics in a mother/daughter relationship. Show some respect for Shirley McClain and Debra Winger for f**k\u0027s sake. That movie won five Oscars for…\" \"Jesus, calm down, Nancy. Does Liz know you\u0027re using her vagina today?\" I asked in mock horror. Jim smiled, \"I\u0027m going to pretend you didn\u0027t say that because if I told Liz, she would cut your nut sack off, dude.\" He was right about that. Liz was a bulldog with rabies and mad cow disease. She would f**k me up if I crossed her. \"Since I just caught you buying condoms, and Claire is like a sister to me, I feel I must say a few words at this time,\" he explained, shoving aside some bottles of lube on a shelf next to him so he could put his box of tampons down and cross his arms in front of him. I nodded. \"By all means.\" \"I like you, Carter, but I met Claire first and I\u0027m engaged to her best friend, so that means, by chick laws, I have to like her more. I feel it\u0027s necessary that I use the words of some of the greats in history to establish the sincerity of the situation we find ourselves in.\" He paused and I waited for him to continue by resting my elbow on the handle of my cart. \"You mess with the bull, you get the horns.\" \"If you want to throw down fisticuffs, I\u0027ve got Jack Johnson and Tom O\u0027Leary waiting for ya, right here.\" \"I\u0027ll get you my pretty and your little dog too.\" \"I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-fuck you.\" I nodded my head, impressed. \"Full Metal Jacket?\" I asked. \"Yep.\" \"Nice touch,\" I replied. Jim turned around and grabbed his tampons off of the shelf. \"Well, alrighty then. My work here is done. I\u0027ve got a few more items to pick up so I\u0027ll talk to you later.\" An hour and a half later, I managed to clean up the house, change the sheets on my bed, make up the extra bed in the spare room for Gavin and set up a couple of the things I bought for him over the past week. Maybe it was a little bit much, but oh well. I\u0027d missed out on four years of birthdays, Christmases, Valentine\u0027s Days, Arbor Days, Sundays and every other day I could have bought him something. I had a lot of time to make up for.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-66.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
