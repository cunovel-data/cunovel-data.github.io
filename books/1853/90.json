He hefted him up higher in his arms and gave me a smile.\\n\\n \"Well, I better get going. It was good seeing you again, Claire. Good luck with the store,\" he said as he moved to the door and used his back to push it open.\\n\\n \"Could you say that TWO more times,\" Carter laughed.\\n\\n I smacked his arm as Max lifted his hand in a wave.\\n\\n Carter waved good-bye to him, shaking his hand in the air frantically like he was a little kid watching a parade.\\n\\n \"Come back again!\" Carter shouted as Max got out the door and onto the sidewalk. \"Claire likes it when people stay more than TWO seconds.\"\\n\\n Max finally disappeared out of sight and Carter turned to face me, a lingering smile still on his face.\\n\\n \"What?\" he asked when he saw the look on mine.\\n\\n \"When you\u0027re ready to start acting like an adult, let me know,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"Adults are the little ones, right?\" he shouted to me as I walked away.\\n\\n I shook my head as I made my way to the counter. Just then my dad walked back over from Liz\u0027s side with a black bag clutched firmly in his hand.\\n\\n Oh sweet Jesus, my brain couldn\u0027t handle anymore crazy today. .\\n\\n We stopped in front of each other and he tried to hide the bag behind his back.\\n\\n \"Dad, did you just buy something from Liz\u0027s store?\" I asked bewilderingly.\\n\\n What in the f**k of f**kery would he need from over there? WHAT? Oh God, where\u0027s Jim? I need his eye bleach.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve got a date tonight,\" he stated matter-of-factly.\\n\\n \"So take her some chocolates! Or a box of cookies. I\u0027m pretty sure what\u0027s in that store isn\u0027t first-date material,\" I said in a panic.\\n\\n There could be flavored lube in that bag right now. Or a c**k ring. Or a strap on. Oh sweet mother f**king Jesus, what if’s been so long since my dad has been with a woman that he bat for the other team now? Nothing against g*y men. I love g*y men. I had a g*y friend in college that I wish I still kept in contact with. He liked to show me the awesome g*ydar he possessed by pointing out every g*y man within a two mile radius. What would he say if he was here right now? \"Oh, Claire, that man is g*yer than Richard Simmons sweatin\u0027 to the oldies on a rainbow.\"\\n\\n When I took Gavin to the library last week there was a book called \"Daddy\u0027s Roommate\" in the children\u0027s section. Should I go back and get that book? Maybe I should buy a copy for future reference. There was also a book called \"I Wish Daddy Didn\u0027t Drink So Much\" and \"It Hurts When I Poop.\"\\n\\n What the f**k has happened to children\u0027s literature since I was little?\\n\\n I knew no matter what, I would love my father. That was a fact. To quote my favorite movie, \"I love my dead, g*y son!\"\\n\\n Well, I love my dead, g*y father. Er, I mean my g*y father.\\n\\n I need a drink.\\n\\n \"Never fear, Mr. Hunt is here!\" Drew proclaimed as he walked through the door holding Jenny\u0027s hand. My dad raised his eyebrow at Drew\u0027s shirt that read, \"Jam out with your clam out.\"\\n\\n \"Hey there, Mr. M, how\u0027s it hanging?\" he asked as he walked over and shook my dad\u0027s hand.\\n\\n It\u0027s hanging a little to the left of Perez Hilton Avenue.\\n\\n \"Oooooh, look at you already sampling the merchandise,\" Drew said, patting my dad on the back in a congratulatory way as he smiled at the black bag still tightly clutched in his hands.\\n\\n \"Claire, the store looks great!\" Jenny told me as she gave me a quick hug.\\n\\n \"Thanks, my dad has a roommate,\" I blurted.\\n\\n All three of them looked at me in silence.\\n\\n \"Mommy, can I have another cookie?\" Gavin asked, running up to me and slamming into my leg.\\n\\n \"No, no more cookies. You already had a chocolate chip cookie. Obviously it wasn\u0027t enough for you and now you want to try a different one. I bet you want to try a peanut butter cookie which is the exact opposite. Peanut butter cookies are on a different team than chocolate chip cookies. I guess chocolate chip cookies just don\u0027t satisfy you anymore do they? One day you just woke up and decided you wanted to eat a completely different cookie from the one you\u0027ve always liked since you were born. You can\u0027t just decide at your age that you want a different cookie. It doesn\u0027t work that way. You pick a cookie and you stick with it!\"\\n\\n Gavin looked up at me in confusion. His poor four-year-old brain was probably going to explode.\\n\\n \"Fine, can I have a chocolate sucker then?\" he asked innocently.\\n\\n I was well aware that no one was moving and they were all standing there looking at me like I was having a nervous breakdown. Maybe I was. I had a g*y father; I was allowed to freak out.\\n\\n \"Hey, Mom, guess what? Last night Papa was kissing somebody,\" Gavin said with a smile.\\n\\n Oh God, here it comes. Who was it? Bill from the hardware store? Tom from the corner coffee shop? Who would be my new step-father-in-law-uncle-friend?\\n\\n \"Gavin, that was supposed to be a secret,\" my dad laughed uncomfortably. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-90.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. \\n 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance \\n Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. \\n When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. \\n With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. \\n Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
