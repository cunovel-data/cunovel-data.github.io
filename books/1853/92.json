I learned how to love another human being more than my own life in that house. But it was time to say good-bye and move on to bigger and better things. In a few months we would begin our future together and handle whatever life threw our way. I knew we would have hard times. I knew we would have a lot of adjusting to do as we learned how to live with each other, but I also knew we would do whatever it took to make it work. I met a boy at a frat party, beat him at beer pong and let him take my virginity and give me a baby in return. Not a fair trade, but one I wouldn\u0027t change for the world. I turned towards Carter and wrapped both of my arms around his waist and stood on my tip toes to kiss Gavin\u0027s cheek while our friends chatted behind us with my dad. \"Hey Gavin, guess what? Daddy and I have something to tell you.\" Carter looked down at me with a surprised look. We agreed to wait until the time was closer to tell Gavin, but I couldn\u0027t hold it in anymore. I didn\u0027t care if he drove me insane asking if it was time yet. I was happy and excited and I wanted my little man to feel it too. I waited for Carter to give me the go-ahead to continue. I mouthed the words \"I love you\" to him and tried not to cry. This man was everything I had ever dreamed of and more. And he was all mine. He nodded his head in agreement and his lips formed an \"I love you\" back to me. I reached up and smoothed Gavin\u0027s hair off of his forehead, letting my fingers trail down his cheeks and over his sweet dimples. \"We\u0027re going to sell our house and then you and I are going to live in Daddy\u0027s house with him,\" I explained. Gavin stared at me for a few minutes and then shifted his focus to Carter. \"Really?\" he asked. Carter nodded his head, \"Really, buddy.\" Gavin looked back at me and smiled, opening his mouth to hopefully tell us how happy he was. \"HOLY SHIT!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-92.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
