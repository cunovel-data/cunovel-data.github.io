{"id":79483,"no":63,"title":"Page 63","content":"\"Because I like you. And Mommy says it’s nice to do things that make people happy. I want you to be happy.\" All I could do was sit there and stare at him. I got it now. I got why Claire hadn\u0027t crumbled when she found out she was pregnant, why she dropped out of college and gave up everything for this little boy. I suddenly realized that my heart was sitting there on my lap and even though I wasn\u0027t here for the first four years of his life, I loved him unconditionally simply because he was mine. He was a part of me. I knew without a doubt, I would give my life to make sure he was safe. I wrapped my arms around his little body, hoping he didn\u0027t still think of me as a stranger and would let me hug him. He leaned into me without hesitation and I rested my forehead against his. \"Buddy, I am already the happiest guy in the world,\" I told him softly. Gavin stared at me for a few minutes and then pulled his other arm out from behind his back. “Good, then after you read that one, you can read this one. I pulled away from him and glanced down in his hand at a book titled “The Vagina Monologues”. After we left the library, I took Gavin to get ice cream and then we headed back to Claire’s house. True to form, Gavin talked the whole way home and I started to wonder if he was like a record player that was skipping and maybe I needed to smack the side of him to get him to stop. I resisted the urge. Barely. When we got back to the house, I sat down on the couch and Gavin grabbed a photo album from one of the end table drawers and curled up on my lap with it. He flipped through all of the pages, explaining each picture to me. I saw every single birthday, Christmas, Halloween and everything in between that I missed, and with Gavin\u0027s commentary about each event, it almost felt like I had been there. I also learned quite a few things about Claire. Like the fact she has cousin she can\u0027t stand. \"That\u0027s Heather. She\u0027s mommy\u0027s cousin. Mommy says she\u0027s a whore,\" Gavin said, pointing at the group photo that looked like it was taken at some sort of family reunion. I also learned that Gavin seemed to have a penchant for squirting things all over the house, showcased by at least five pages in the photo album. I guess I should have taken a picture of the toothpaste incident a few weeks ago. \"Gavin, how come there are so many pictures of you making messes?\" I asked as I flipped to the next page that showed a picture of him sitting on the kitchen floor in a pile of coffee grounds, cereal, oatmeal and what looked like syrup. \"I hope you cleaned up all this stuff for mommy.\" \"Cleaning is ridiculous,\" he replied. Considering the current state of my own home, I couldn\u0027t really argue that fact. We continued to look at the rest of the pictures in that album and four others before I noticed that Gavin was unusually quiet on my lap. I glanced down and saw that he had fallen asleep sitting up. I awkwardly scooped my hands under his legs and carried him to his room exactly how he fell asleep - with his back against my chest and his legs dangling down off of my hands. I knew there was some sort of rule about \"never wake a sleeping baby\" and I figured that had to apply to toddlers as well since they could get into much more trouble than a baby. After getting him tucked into bed, I came back out into the living room and relaxed on the couch. I turned on the TV, flipping through the channels until I found something to watch. An hour later, right when I started to doze off, my phone buzzed for probably the tenth time since I left the house earlier with Gavin. I smiled as I pulled my phone out of my pocket, knowing it would be Claire again. How\u0027s it going? Is everything ok? ~ Claire I couldn\u0027t even be offended that she was so worried. It was understandable. Surprisingly, being alone with Gavin wasn\u0027t bad at all. He was really well behaved, better than any child I had ever been around. Perfect. Gavin just got his first lap dance. He’s hopped up on Red Bull and crack right now and I found out he doesn\u0027t like whiskey. ~Carter I laughed to myself and hit send. My phone buzzed immediately with her reply, like I knew it would. I hope you at least sprang for the hot chick and not some butter face with VD. And your son prefers vodka, like his mother. ~Claire My laugh at her reply was so loud I glanced down the hall to make sure it didn\u0027t wake Gavin. I quickly typed a reply back. Even though she made a joke, I knew without a doubt she was masking a tiny bit of fear. Everything is fine, Mom. Same as it was five minutes ago when you asked ;) ~Carter My phone buzzed not five seconds later. Oh shut up! It\u0027s not him I\u0027m worried about. I was afraid you were duct taped to a chair or had your head shaved by now. ~Claire The doorbell rang and as I got up to find out who it was, I quickly sent off another text letting her know that our son was not able to overpower me. Yet. I opened the door to find Drew standing there with a box in his hands. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked. Drew pushed past me into the house. \"Nice to see you too, pig f**ker. I\u0027ve got all of Claire’s flyers, brochures and whatever other shit Jenny was doing for her. She asked me to drop them off here for her. What are you doing here? And why are you still wearing the same clothes from last night? Did you finally bump uglies with your MILF?\" I took the box out of his hand and rolled my eyes at him. \"Will you shut up already, dick? Gavin is sleeping.\" Drew looked past me towards Gavin\u0027s room.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-63.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
