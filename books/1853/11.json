{"id":79433,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Did I sleep with a nutcase that decided to carve my dick like a jack-o-lantern while I slept? Or maybe her vagina had teeth. My dad used to always tell me when I was a teenager to stay away from them, because they bite. I thought he was kidding. Oh God, I can’t look. What if some of it is missing?\n \"Calm down. Let\u0027s assess the situation,\" Drew said, crossing one leg over the other and folding his hands on his knee. \"Have you noticed any of the following: unidentified discharge, burning sensation when you urinate, lower abdominal pain, testicular pain, pain during sex, fever, headache, sore throat, weight loss, chronic diarrhea or night sweats?\"\n He sounded like a f**king commercial for syphilis.\n \"Eeew dude, no. I just have blood on my dick,\" I answered irritably, pointing to the problem but refusing to look.\n He leaned over and looked down at my lap.\n \"Looks okay to me,\" he said with a shrug as he stood up. \"You probably just bagged a virgin.\"\n I sat there with my bloody, non-chlamydia infested dick flapping in the breeze and my jaw hanging open.\n A virgin? That can\u0027t be right.\n I glanced back down in my lap and took a closer look. Okay so it wasn\u0027t the bloody slaughter I originally thought I saw. My dick hadn\u0027t been Texas Chainsaw Massacred. There were just a few pink streaks. I wore a condom though. How in the hell does something like this happen? You use those God dammed things as water balloons in middle school and couldn’t get them to pop even if you threw them at a bed of nails. The one time you need them to stay in one piece they decide to say “fuck this shit”. It was like condom anarchy.\n But more importantly - Holy hell! Why would she let me take her virginity? Why in the f**k would she give something like that to me when I was completely shit-faced and couldn\u0027t even make it sort of enjoyable for her? What an epic fail. I probably ruined sex for her forever. She\u0027s probably thinking right now \"Seriously? That\u0027s what I waited for? What a joke.\"\n \"I have to find out who she is. I need to apologize,\" I mumbled to myself, standing up and pulling my boxers and jeans on.\n \"Whoa, dude. You didn\u0027t even get her name? Wow, you\u0027re kind of a dick,\" Drew said with a laugh, walking over to the bedroom door and opening it.\n I threw my shirt over my head and then followed behind him, hopping on one foot to slide my shoes on.\n \"Thanks for making me feel a whole lot better Drew. Really. You\u0027re a stellar friend,\" I said sarcastically as we maneuvered our way through a house full of passed out drunks.\n \"Hey, it\u0027s not my fault you banged and bailed bro,\" he stated as he took a giant step over a naked chick wearing just a sombrero and opened the front door.\n \"I didn\u0027t bang and bail. In case you failed to notice, I woke up alone in bed this morning.\"\n \"With a bloody johnson,\" he added, walking down the steps of the porch.\n \"With a f**king bloody johnson,\" I repeated with a groan. \"Shit. I have to find this girl. Do you think it\u0027s wrong for me to ask your dad to use his private detective resources to find out who she is?\"\n Drew’s dad opened his own PI agency a few years ago when he decided following the rules of the police department didn’t fit in with his busy schedule.\n \"Are you asking me if it\u0027s ethically wrong or if I think it\u0027s wrong? Because those are two very different questions my friend,\" he replied as we crossed the street and got into his car parked by the curb. If only Drew took after his father in some way…\n \"I have to find her Drew,\" I said as he started up the car.\n \"Then find her we shall my little virginity thief!\"\n \"We never found her, did we big guy?\" I muttered to Drew, who I assumed was still sitting next to me.\n \"Are you speaking to anyone in particular or do your shot glasses usually respond?\" replied a very un-Drew-sounding voice.\n \"Now, if you\u0027ll direct your attention to the one Claire is holding, that is called the Purple Pussy Eater. It has four speeds: Yes, More, Faster and Holy Shit Balls. It\u0027s also got a g-spot stimulator that is sure to tickle your fancy. Could you hold it up a little higher so everyone can see, Claire?\"\n I shot Liz a look that clearly said “bend over so I can shove this thing up your ass sideways” before I raised the rubber penis above my head with absolutely no enthusiasm.\n The living room full of completely trashed women screamed in excitement and bounced up and down in their seats when I raised my arm, like the thing I was holding above my head was the actual penis of Brad Pitt. It\u0027s plastic, people. And it\u0027s filled with double A\u0027s, not sperm.\n \"Go ahead and pass it around for me, Claire,\" Liz said sweetly as she reached into her suitcase for yet another rubber rod.\n I held my arm out lifelessly in front of me for the drunk-ass sitting closest to grab, but she was too busy complaining about how her husband\u0027s spunk always tastes like garlic.\n Please God don\u0027t let me ever come face-to-face with this man, I beg of you. I will look at his crotch and see cloves of garlic popping out of his dick.\n \"Yo, Lara,\" I called, trying to get her attention so she could take this dildo out of my hand.\n \"Claire, remember to use her Bedroom Fun Party name!\" Liz reminded me in a sickeningly sweet voice that was starting to make my ears bleed.\n I gritted my teeth and imagined raising my arm back up and chucking the fake phallus right at her forehead so she would have a permanent dick head mark right in the middle of her face that people would point and laugh at. Is that a birthmark? No, it\u0027s a dick mark. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-11.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. \n 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance \n Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. \n When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. \n With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. \n Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
