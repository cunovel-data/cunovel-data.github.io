That\u0027s something you have to discuss with a woman. You don\u0027t just go poking around or you\u0027ll get punch in the face and the words, \"EXIT ONLY!\" screamed at you.\\n\\n The word \u0027vagina\u0027 being yelled right at that moment was the only thing that pulled my mind and my dream dick out of this chick\u0027s ass.\\n\\n \"By the end of the night, every woman in that room was giving my vagina sad looks. My vagina is going to get a complex, Liz.\"\\n\\n Jim was the only one of us with any brains at this point. He walked over to the two women and stood quietly next to the one with the great ass, vodka bottle still in hand.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s already judging me because it\u0027s only gotten off with my hand. And I don\u0027t count dry humping your leg that one time we were really drunk after finals freshman year.\"\\n\\n I have now lost all motor function. Someone check and see if I just came.\\n\\n “Oh my God, I think I just wet myself,” Drew whispered excitedly.\\n\\n \"Why the hell are you staring at me like that?\" the woman asked irritably as she looked back and forth between Liz and Jim. She whispered something and Liz just nodded her head and looked in our direction. By the speed with which her hand flew out and grabbed the vodka bottle and chugged it, I\u0027m guessing she just realized there were other people in the room listening to her talk about blah, blah, blah, mast***ation, blah, blah, girl-on-girl-action. She slowly turned her body around and her eyes flew right to mine. I felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and watched the bottle of vodka slip from her hands. Jim calmly stuck his arm out and caught the bottle before it hit the floor, while I just sat there staring at the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.\\n\\n Okay, I knew I saw her last night, but I was drunk and objects in drunk eyes may appear hotter than they actually are. My recollection of her face in my mind might not have been as accurate as I thought it was. Thankfully, she was just as beautiful as I remembered. And now I felt really bad that she looked so horrified by everything she blurted out to Liz when she thought no one else was here.\\n\\n \"So, who wants another drink?\" Liz asked cheerfully as she moved around the brown-haired beauty.\\n\\n Drew and I wordlessly lifted our beer bottles to show Liz we were all set. She grabbed onto the poor girl\u0027s arm and dragged her into the living room. I watched her bring the vodka bottle back up to her lips and take another swig as she walked. Liz snatched the bottle away from her and slammed it down on the coffee table.\\n\\n \"Carter, this is Claire. Claire, this is Carter,\" Liz said, emphasizing our names for some reason. I feared for Liz’s life a little right now. I was afraid Claire might claw her eyes out.\\n\\n \"We sort of met last night,\" I said with a smile, trying to move the attention to me and save Liz from disfigurement.\\n\\n Claire let out a hysterical laugh.\\n\\n Liz sat down on the couch, pulling Claire down next to her.\\n\\n \"Well, we have a few minutes before dinner will be ready. Jim tells me you guys just moved here from Toledo, is that right?\" Liz asked as Jim walked in front of the women to take a seat on the other side of Claire.\\n\\n I nodded my head. \"Yeah, we were transferred here from the Toledo Automotive plant.\"\\n\\n I turned my gaze back to Claire. Her knee was bouncing up and down at a frantic pace. Liz reached over and put her hand on it to stop the movement.\\n\\n \"So, Claire, how long have you been a bartender?\" I asked. I wanted to know everything there was about her. And I wasn\u0027t going to lie, I was dying to hear her voice again and learn more about her vagina and how often she found herself humping girlfriends. Shit, please don\u0027t let me get a hard-on right now.\\n\\n \"Almost five years,\" she said as another awkward laugh bubbled out of her and Jim reached up to pat her on the back a few times.\\n\\n How much of the vodka did she chug from that bottle?\\n\\n \"Liz, I can\u0027t take it anymore,\" Drew interrupted. \"You look so f**king familiar.\"\\n\\n Claire jumped to her feet, her knee slamming into the coffee table and knocking over the two beer bottles. Thankfully they were already empty.\\n\\n \"I think I heard the timer go off on the oven. Liz, did you hear the timer go off?\" she asked.\\n\\n Liz shook her head casually. \"Nope. Definitely didn\u0027t hear the timer,\" she said with a smile.\\n\\n I watched as Claire turned her back to us and faced Liz.\\n\\n \"The timer definitely went off. You just didn\u0027t hear it because you weren\u0027t paying attention. We need to go check on the food. Because the timer. It went off.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Liz,\" Drew said. \"I think she\u0027s trying to tell you the timer went off!\"\\n\\n He laughed at his own joke and I reached over and smacked his arm.\\n\\n Watching her go from horrified to embarrassed to nervous was fascinating. She was like a beautiful train wreck and I couldn\u0027t stop watching.\\n\\n Liz sighed and finally stood up, smiling at Drew and me while she excused herself and followed Claire into the kitchen.\\n\\n Drew leaned over and whispered in my ear, \"Did you see the way Liz looked at me? I think I definitely banged her.\"\\n\\n 9. Claire’s Coochie Kills\\n\\n Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, f**k. Can a person die from humiliation? Shitfuckdamn.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027m having a heart attack. Or maybe a stroke. Which is the one that makes your left arm numb?\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve lost all brain function. This is it. I\u0027m dying. Tell my folks I love them.\\n\\n \"A stroke,\" Liz said in a deadpan voice as she followed me into the kitchen. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-27.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. \\n 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance \\n Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. \\n When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. \\n With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. \\n Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
