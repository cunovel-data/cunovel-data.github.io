{"id":79487,"no":67,"title":"Page 67","content":"My son was going to spend the night at my house. I kind of wanted to jump up and down and clap my hands like a girl. I was excited to curl up with him on the couch in his pajamas and watch the new movie I picked up earlier. I couldn\u0027t wait to tuck him into bed and wake up with him tomorrow morning and get him breakfast. I wanted to experience all of the things that made up his day. I wanted to hear him laugh, listen to him talk and watch him interact with Claire. Claire. Beautiful, smart, funny, sexy Claire who was going to be spending the night at my house as well. I couldn\u0027t wait to wake up with her next to me in the morning. I missed out on that five years ago, and I wasn\u0027t about to go without this time. I wanted her face to be the first thing I saw when the sun came up and her body curled up next to mine to be the first thing I felt. But most of all, I wanted to be coherent for every single second. I didn\u0027t want the haze of alcohol to take anything away from this night for either one of us. I hope she didn\u0027t think it was too forward of me to buy condoms. If she didn\u0027t want to do anything, there was no way I would pressure her. But if she asked my throbbing python of love to come out and play, I wasn\u0027t going to complain. I just poured a box of noodles into a pot of boiling water when the doorbell rang. I set the timer on the stove and quickly walked through the living room and answered the door. As soon as it opened, Gavin barged past me and into the living room. \"Hi Carter! Mommy has ni**les! Do you have ni**les?\" he asked as he took off his backpack and dumped the contents in the middle of the floor. \"Oh my God, Gavin, filter!\" Claire scolded as she walked through the doorway, rolling her eyes at me. I laughed as I shut the door behind her and tried not to grab her ass or sniff her hair. Jesus, she really did have a great ass. \"What\u0027s the deal with the ni**les question?\" I asked as we both stood in the entry to the living room, watching Gavin sort through the stuff he brought. \"He was in my room when I got dressed earlier and he asked me what they were. I thought I should be honest with him and now I realize it was a big mistake. He spent the whole way here singing \"All I want for Christmas are my two front ni**les.\" I almost opened the door and shoved him out into oncoming traffic,\" Claire said with a laugh. “Mommy stopped the car and unlocked the doors and told me to get out and walk,” Gavin informed me. “Okay, almost isn’t exactly accurate,” she told me with a shrug. “In my defense, I did tell him if he said the word “nipples” one more time I was going to stop the car and make him walk. According to his pediatrician, it’s important to always follow through with your threats.” I helped Claire take her coat off and scooped up Gavin’s that he’d thrown on the floor and hung both of them up in the closet. \"Maybe now isn\u0027t the best time to tell you that he asked me if I he had a vagina this morning and then asked me to read him ‘The Vagina Monologues’ at the library.\" Claire groaned and shook her head. \"What the hell am I going to do when he starts preschool in a few months? He\u0027s going to be like that kid in the movie, Kindergarten Cop, except he\u0027s going to announce \"Boys have a penis and girls have a vagina and my mommy has ni**les!\" I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her against my side, noting again how good her body felt next to mine. \"You mean what the hell are we going to do?\" I corrected her. I needed to make sure she understood that I wasn\u0027t going to change my mind about all of this. \"Don’t forget, he\u0027s also going to tell everyone just how huge my wiener is. At least I hope he is. Maybe I should remind him about the awesomeness that is my wiener. \" Claire raised her eyebrows at me and I realized that didn\u0027t come out right at all. \"That sounded a lot skeazier than I meant it too.\" Claire turned her body into mine so that we were chest-to-chest and my back was to Gavin. She rested her arms on my shoulders, letting her fingers play with the hair on the back of my neck. I got goose bumps on my arms and Mr. Happy just woke up from his evening nap and started drooling. \"Can we please ban the word wiener?\" she asked with a laugh. I glanced over my shoulder at Gavin. He had his back to us and was busy talking to his Batman figurine, asking it if it had ni**les. I looked back at Claire and let my hands slide down her hips and around to her ass to pull her up against me. \"Only if you use the word \u0027cock\u0027 from now on,\" I told her with a smirk. She pushed her hips into me and I let out a groan when she came in contact with my raging erection. \"T.J. told me you paid him twenty dollars the other night to get me to say that.\" Shit. T.J. was going down the next time we played P.O.R.N. He was going to get a ball right to his throat. I placed my lips to the corner of her mouth and then kissed a path across her cheek. When I got to the soft skin right behind her ear, I let my tongue snake out so I could taste her. She let out a little moan and pushed her hips back into me. She turned her face so her lips hovered by my ear. \"Cock, cock, c-o-c-k,\" she whispered, drawing out the syllables in the last one. \"Holy f**king hell…\" I mumbled, wrapping my arms around her waist and hugging her tightly so her hips stopped moving against me. The timer in the kitchen went off and all thoughts of Claire’s lips and “cock” were put aside. I unwound myself from her and we all made our way into the kitchen so I could finish the spaghetti.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-67.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
