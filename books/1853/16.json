I knew it was shitty of me and I probably deserved to walk in on her gargling with the neighbor\u0027s spunk, but it still sucked. Clearing my head of duck-fucking rabbits and depressing thoughts, I raised my glass in the air with an angry growl and waited for the other three to do the same. \"We\u0027re drinking to all of the lying bitches in this world that wouldn\u0027t know how to tell the truth if it smacked them in the f**king face. Cheers!\" I threw back the shot and slammed my glass down, wondering why the beautiful girl in front of me hadn\u0027t drank hers and instead stood there staring at me with a look of horror on her face. I watched her friend elbow her and she quickly sucked that shot down like a champ. And then proceeded to pour herself another. And another. And then, like ten more after that - in a row. She’d obviously overcome her decision that it wasn’t a good idea to drink on the job. Drew and I just kind of sat there watching her in awe. I mean, I drank like ten times that much tonight, but not all at once. Half the bottle was gone by the time Liz reached over and took it out of her hands. \"Okay there, home slice, I think that\u0027s enough for now.\" I was seriously losing my ability to focus at this point. I wanted to ask her if I could suck on one of her fingers and see if it tasted like a Snickers bar. I wanted to ask her what her name was and tell her I didn\u0027t always do stuff like this, but she was already walking away and I couldn\u0027t figure out how to lift up my arm to signal her back. I stared down at my arm resting on the bar and it just sat there like a little piece of shit slacker. I stared really hard at it and thought about it moving, but it didn\u0027t work. Fucking arm. It must be in a union and on a break. I can\u0027t feel my teeth. \"Drew, I can\u0027t feel my teeth.\" I tapped my finger against them. I had dreams all the time that my teeth were falling out. Fuck, what if this was one of those dreams? But it can\u0027t be a dream because I don\u0027t remember falling asleep. In my dreams my teeth were always falling in my lap and there was blood everywhere and no one cared that I was spitting them all out. Every tooth I touch just falls right out and no one looked at me funny even though that was some crazy shit, right? I ran my fingers around the hard edges of all my teeth. Never mind, it\u0027s fine. Teeth are still there. \"Yeah, I think it\u0027s time to say nighty-night and get you home, little buddy,\" Drew said as he got up from his stool and threw a wad of bills down on the bar before pulling my dead arm up and swinging it over his shoulders. I looked up at Drew as he helped me walk out of the bar. \"I wanna eat her Snickers finger but my arm teeth won\u0027t feel.\" I didn\u0027t remember much after that. 6. I Got a Big Weiner I was having the best dream ever. It was one of those hot dreams where you\u0027re having sex and you start having an orgasm and you slowly wake up in the middle of it and you don\u0027t know if you really did just have an orgasm or if it was part of the dream, but you know you want it to keep going. I was warm and cozy under the covers, and I slid my hand down between my legs to either do it again or finish it. Right when my fingers started to slip inside my underwear, I opened my eyes and screamed. \"HOLY SHIT!\" My son stood there next to the bed just staring at me. Seriously, two inches from my face just staring at me like those creepy twins in \"The Shining.\" I waited for him to start saying, \"Come play with us\" in their freaky twin voices while I tried not to have a heart attack. \"Gavin, seriously. You can\u0027t just stand here and stare at mommy. It\u0027s weird,\" I grumbled as I put my hand to my aching head and tried to calm my pounding heart. Sweet Jesus, who kicked me in the head and shit in my mouth last night? \"You said a bad word, Mommy,\" he informed me as he clambered onto my bed and straddled my waist. My other hand joined the first one on my head and I held on tight, fearing the entire thing was going to explode all over the room. \"Yes, Mommy said bad words. Sometimes mommies say bad words. Just don\u0027t ever repeat them, got it?\" He started bouncing up and down on my stomach like he was riding one of those stupid hopping balls with handles. \"Gavin, come on. Mommy doesn\u0027t feel good,\" I complained. He stopped bouncing and leaned forward to sprawl his body out on top of me, putting his face right up to mine. \"Do you want me ta\u0027 beat up your friends, Mommy?\" he whispered conspiratorially. I removed my hands from my head and opened my eyes to look at him. \"What are you talking about, Gav?\" He brought his hands up and put them on my chest, resting his chin on top. \"Your friends, Mommy. The ones who maded you sick,\" he said in a voice that clearly screamed, \"Duh.\" I wrapped my arms around his little body and shook my head at him. \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about, buddy.\" He let out an exasperated sigh. Poor kid. He got stuck with a dumb mother. \"Papa says your friends Johnny, Jack and Jose maded you sick. Friends shouldn\u0027t do stuff like that, Mommy. If Luke maded me sick, I\u0027d punch him in the nuts!\" \"Gavin! Come on, we don\u0027t say things like that,\" I scolded him. \"Fine,\" he huffed. \"I\u0027d tickle him in the nuts.\" Jesus Christ on a waffle cone. There\u0027s a reason why some animals in the wild eat their young.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-16.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
