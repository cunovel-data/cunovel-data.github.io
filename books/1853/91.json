{"id":79507,"no":91,"title":"Page 91","content":"Ha, ha, what a funny story. My dad and Gavin had a secret. Isn\u0027t that cute? Isn\u0027t that f**king cute? I like how my son isn\u0027t at all fazed to see two men kissing. It shows great promise for the future of this country. However, I don\u0027t like that he isn\u0027t at all fazed that he saw his grandpa sucking face with a dude!\n \"Oh, ha, ha, a secret!\" I laughed hysterically. \"I guess the cat is out of the bag huh, Dad? Or should I say, out of the closet? Whew, is it hot in here?\" I rambled, fanning my face with my hand.\n Carter walked over then, leaving his station at the front door greeting customers. He must have seen my crazy eyes from across the store and knew I was seriously freaking out. Worse than that one time I ate a pot cookie in high school and then watched The Wizard of Oz while listening to Pink Floyd\u0027s \"The Wall\", when everyone knows you’re supposed to listen to “The Dark Side of the Moon” and started crying because Toto was looking at me funny and when he barked it came out as, \"Hey you, standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles, can you hear me?\" and I could totally hear him and my feet started to itch. I cried for three hours telling everyone the cookie was evil and would kill me in my sleep.\n Don\u0027t do drugs.\n \"Claire, you okay?\" Carter asked, picking Gavin up into his arms to stand next to me.\n \"I\u0027m super! I\u0027ve never been better! This is the best day of my whole life!\" I said with a big smile. \"We should all go out back and smoke some pot.\"\n What the hell was I spewing out of my mouth?\n \"George, you forgot your receipt,\" Liz said as she walked over from her side with a slip of paper in her hand.\n \"Sue is going to love that nightgown, I\u0027m telling you. The silk is so soft and that peach color is going to look awesome with her skin tone,\" Liz said, coming up next to my dad and handing him the receipt.\n Wait, what? Sue? There was a guy named Sue in Butler? Shouldn\u0027t I know this?\n My dad actually blushed and quickly glanced at me.\n \"Uh, yeah. Thanks, Liz. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll love it.\"\n She! Sue\u0027s a she. She\u0027s a Sue-she.\n \"She\u0027s a she!\" I proclaimed.\n Carter\u0027s arm that wasn\u0027t supporting Gavin wrapped around my waist to hold me up. I was sure he figured any minute now I was going to crack up permanently, probably even fall face-first onto the floor without putting my hands out to stop me like some of those idiots on Tosh.0.\n I could hear Tosh\u0027s voice in my head, \"Okay, let\u0027s watch that one again in slow motion. Now watch as she just falls forward, never putting her arms out and then BAM! Face plant! Wow, that\u0027s gotta hurt!\"\n \"I probably should have told you this sooner, Claire. I\u0027m kinda seeing Sue Zammond. You know, that woman who runs the travel agency over on Short Avenue? So, yeah. I\u0027m seeing her,\" George said, shuffling his feet.\n \"Good for you, George,\" Carter told him as I gave him a quick hug in congratulations. My dad hadn’t dated anyone seriously since my mom left. By the look on his face, I’d say things with Sue just might be heading in that direction and I was happy for him.\n Carter, George and Drew walked over to the front counter to help out a few customers while the girls and I stood back and watched.\n \"I am so in love with Drew,\" Jenny said with a sigh. \"I just can\u0027t look at him without thinking about his orgasm face.\"\n \"Jesus, Jenny! Over share,\" Liz complained.\n \"So you guys are really serious, huh?\" I asked her, trying not to dry heave thinking about the words Drew and orgasm face all in one sentence.\n She nodded her head and smiled.\n \"We are! He\u0027s taking me to Chicago next week to meet his parents. I\u0027m so excited! I\u0027ve never been to the Windy Cindy,\" she said happily.\n Liz opened her mouth and I quickly covered it with my hand.\n \"Don\u0027t. Just…don\u0027t,\" I told her.\n Drew came up behind Jenny then and wrapped his arms around her waist, leaning down to kiss her cheek.\n \"Excuse me, I was wondering if you had someplace I could put my boner?\"\n Jenny giggled and Liz gagged.\n \"So Liz, have you and Jim set a wedding date yet?\" Drew asked, keeping his arms firmly around Jenny.\n \"As a matter of fact we did. So you guys all better keep your calendars wide open for the next couple of months. There will be meetings and discussions and appointments and fittings,\" she said as she ticked the items off on her fingers. \"Oh and Claire, we want Gavin to be our ring bearer.\"\n I looked at her like she was insane.\n \"Have you met my son?\" I asked her.\n She just laughed at me.\n Poor, confused Liz. She\u0027ll find out soon enough. Like when she\u0027s standing at the back of the church on the most important day of her life and my son runs down the aisle at full speed in front of her, chucking the pillow at her grandma\u0027s head and calling Jim\u0027s uncle a dirty nut sack.\n \"Liz, how do you feel about facial hair for the wedding?\" Drew asked seriously as he ran his fingers down his chin.\n \"Don\u0027t even think about having a soul patch at my wedding, Drew. No douche-tags allowed,\" she replied.\n Liz turned her attention in my direction. \"Speaking of the future, what\u0027s next for Claire and Carter?\"\n What\u0027s next? What isn\u0027t next is the better question. So much was changing. Jesus, so much already HAD changed.\n I watched Carter walk towards me with Gavin in his arms, tickling him and making him giggle. I took a few deep breaths and calmed down. Everyone I loved was standing here in this room, in my store, happy and healthy. Carter walked to my side and draped his arm around my waist, reminding me that no matter what came my way, I wouldn\u0027t have to face it alone. I had my friends, I had my family and I had Carter. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-91.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. \n 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance \n Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. \n When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. \n With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. \n Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
