I looked back down at the incredible woman standing in front of me and knew I felt the same way about her. \"I don\u0027t want the boogey man to get you and I hate clowns,\" I blurted out. She laughed and patted my cheek in sympathy. I sucked at this. I didn\u0027t do well under pressure. I cared about her and Gavin and I just wanted her to know I wasn\u0027t going anywhere. How f**king hard was that to say? \"That\u0027s not what I mean. I mean, yes, I hate clowns. They are dumb and creepy and grown men should never wear anything with polka dots or giant shoes.\" God dammit, stop the word vomit! Before I could open my mouth and stick a giant clown shoe in any further, Claire covered my mouth with her hand. \"It\u0027s okay if you\u0027re freaked out. I wouldn\u0027t blame you, believe me. This is a lot to take in,\" she said softly. “All of a sudden you go from single and free to having a built-in family.” I took a deep breath and tried it again, reaching up and pulling her hand away from my mouth and resting it flat against my chest. \"Let me just start off by saying I really, really suck ass at doing the whole \"touchy-feely, talk about my feelings\" shit. Although if you ask Drew, he would surely disagree since he spent five years listening to me whine like a baby about how much I wanted to find you. After all that time and spending years driving everyone around me crazy just trying to find your smell again, I am not about to f**k this up and run screaming into the night.\" Her thumb moved back and forth over my chest and she brought her other hand up to my cheek before leaning forward and placing a soft kiss on my lips. When she pulled her face back, I wrapped my arms around her small waist and rested my forehead against hers. \"I know after I found out I fled the scene like a hit-and-run driver, but I promise you Claire, I will never get spooked again.\" She pulled back and looked me in the eye, the corners of her mouth turning up in a smile. \"Did you really just quote Cocktail to me right now?\" \"Yes, yes I did. If you\u0027d like me to go all crazy Tom Cruise and jump up and down on a couch for you, I\u0027ll totally do it.\" \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I WOULD RATHER TAKE IT UP THE ASS!\" Drew’s booming voice from the living room pulled our attentions away from each other. We took one last look at Gavin before closing his door, and then walked hand in hand down the hall to find everyone sitting around the living room playing a twisted game of \"would you rather\". Claire and I sat down next to each other on the couch. I put my arm around her shoulders and she snuggled into my side. Nothing had felt this perfect in a long time. \"Alright, my turn,\" Drew said. \"Jim, would you rather have your p**n name be Hugh G. Rection or Mike Unstinks?\" 15. I’m a Dirty Slut \"Chains and whips excite me...c-c-c-come on, come on...S-S-S-S-M-M-M...\" \"Gavin Allen Morgan, if you don\u0027t stop singing that song I am going to put you on the curb for the garbage men to pick up,\" I yelled for the tenth time today as I finished cleaning up the kitchen from lunch. \"That\u0027s boring,\" Gavin muttered before stomping off to his room. \"Speaking of garbage, when is that Christy guy going to be here?\" my dad asked from his seat at the kitchen table. Why is everyone determined to get on my nerves today? \"It\u0027s CARTER, Dad. Stop being an ass. He\u0027ll be here when he wakes up.\" My dad made a production of looking down at his wrist where there wasn’t even a watch. “It’s 12:48. What kind of a slacker is this guy?” I threw the dish towel on the counter and turned to give my dad a dirty look. “He works the nightshift, dad. We’ve been over this already. One more comment out of you and I’m changing your Facebook status to “I love penis.” I walked over to the fridge to add a few things to my shopping list that hung off of the freezer and tried not to glance at the clock. I was definitely anxious to see Carter. I was up to my eyeballs in stuff for the grand opening and Carter was working a lot of overtime so we hadn\u0027t seen each other since the night of dinner a week earlier. But we talked on the phone and he also called a few times just to talk to Gavin, which totally made my heart melt. Thoughts of our time in the storage room earned me extra credit in Liz Homework by making my way through my suitcase of \"who needs a man\" products for a second time. Liz got all choked up on the phone when I told her. It was a beautiful moment for the two of us. I was working at the bar tonight so Carter was going to give me a ride up there. I called Liz and told her she and Jim should come so Carter wouldn\u0027t be bored. \"I think maybe I\u0027ll hide behind the couch and jump out when he gets here. Put the fear of George into him,\" my dad said with a nod of his head. \"Not funny. And don\u0027t you mean \"fear of God\"?\" He shrugged. \"Same thing.\" God said \"Let there be light\" and George Morgan flipped the switch. This was the most my dad had spoken about Carter since they met. Granted, it wasn\u0027t very flattering but hey, it was progress. At least he was acknowledging his existence and not thinking up new ways to kill him. Dad had been going down the alphabet for a week now and finally stopped at the letter S. Death by shopping cart suffocation, in case you were wondering. The doorbell rang and I hurried to answer it. I wiped my hands on the front of my jeans, smoothed my hair and bent forward to reach my hand down the front of my shirt and tug each of the girls up so their prime real estate was on full display. I stood back up, took a deep breath and flung the door open. My heart actually skipped a beat when I saw Carter standing there.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-54.html","bookId":1853,"book":{"id":1853,"title":"Seduction and Snacks (Chocolate Lovers #1)","description":"Storyline: Warning #1: This book is not to be taken seriously. Do not read this if you don\u0027t have the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. Do not read this if you ARE a fifteen year old boy. This book is totally crude and inappropriate and uses the word \"vagina\" a lot. No, I mean A LOT. If you don\u0027t think people who are drunk are hilarious, you shouldn\u0027t read this book. You probably shouldn\u0027t read this book if you aren\u0027t drunk yourself. You should probably just put this book down and get drunk. You may think that no one in the world talks like the people in this book, but they do. They are called \"people who are funny and inappropriate\". This book is completely unrealistic; the author is aware of that fact and did it on purpose. 2012 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee - Best Romance Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he’s asleep) toddler a better life. When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. With Carter’s undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire’s panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after. Warning #2: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.jpg","author":"Tara Sivec","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:45 PM"}}
