My head is killing me, feels like it weighs a million pounds, and as I look all around, blinking, I struggle to figure out where I am.\n I spot Bree sitting beside me, Charlie by her side, and Ben beside him. We are in some sort of cell, but it is different than the cave. It is a small metal cell, protected by metal bars, leading to an outside tunnel. It is just the four of us in here.\n I wonder if I\u0027m awake or dreaming, until Bree suddenly sits up and looks at me.\n \"Brooke?\" she asks.\n She leans over and gives me a huge hug. My head is splitting, but I still try to hug her back. Charlie runs over and hugs me, too. Ben kneels down, looks at me, and places a gentle hand on my face.\n \"You\u0027re alive,\" he says with relief.\n He leans in and kisses me on the forehead, and despite everything, I am electrified by the feel of his lips on my skin.\n He looks at me with such love, as do the others, and I realize, finally, that I\u0027m alive. We made it.\n \"What happened?\" I ask.\n \"You killed the monster,\" Charlie says.\n \"And then you passed out, under the water, and Ben dove down and saved you.\"\n \"When the monster died, they called the game,\" Ben says. \"They ushered us all away, to this new cell. I think no one\u0027s ever killed it before. I think they\u0027re trying to figure out what to do with us. I don\u0027t think they could\u0027ve killed us right there, in front of everyone. I think the crowd wanted more.\"\n I sit up, rubbing my head, trying to remember. I remember jumping off the cave, stabbing the monster, plunging underwater...but then nothing.\n \"You\u0027re very brave,\" Ben says.\n \"How long have I been here?\" I ask.\n \"You\u0027ve been out for hours. It\u0027s nighttime now. They brought us to this new cell. I think something different is happening. I don\u0027t know what. But I think we really pissed some people off.\"\n I hear the distant sound of a metal door opening, then slamming. There\u0027s the sound of dozens of marching boots, and we all sit up and look.\n Several slaverunners appear. They open our cell door, and standing in the center is their leader. He\u0027s taller and bigger up close, a shoulder length above all the others, and wears a long green cape. He is holding something, and I am amazed to see what it is.\n \"Penelope!\" Bree screams.\n She squirms and barks in his hands, trying to get away; but the leader holds her tight against his chest with an iron grip, practically suffocating her.\n \"This is your dog,\" he says to her, in a deep, twisted voice. \"Or should I say, was. It\u0027s our property now.\"\n Penelope whines, and I can see the disappointment on Bree\u0027s face.\n The leader turns to me, and his smile drops to a frown.\n \"You have defied me,\" he says. \"I\u0027ve never seen anyone do what you have done. You have made a fool of me in front of all my people.\"\n I swallow, wondering what\u0027s in store for us. I pray there are no more arenas. My body can\u0027t take another day.\n \"But vengeance will be mine,\" he continues. \"Tomorrow, I will have the four of you publicly executed, on top of our highest knoll, for everyone to see. We will send a message to all the others who try to defy our rules.\"\n He takes a step forward, and smiles at me.\n \"In the meantime, for your final night on earth, I will grant you one last wish. I\u0027m going to allow you to choose one person of the four of you who will live. The choice will be on your head. All the others will die. You can choose yourself if you like.\"\n He looks down at me with an evil smile, and I realize that this is the cruelest of all the things he\u0027s done. How can I choose one of the four of us? Of course, I would choose Bree. But that would be so unfair to Charlie, and to Ben. Choosing one would be a death sentence for the others. And Bree would be torn by guilt. I know her. I can\u0027t do that to her. I can\u0027t have all of our blood on her head.\n I think quick, wracking my brain - and I get an idea.\n \"I choose our dog, Penelope,\" I say. \"Allow her to stay with us for our final night.\"\n The leader looks down at me as if I\u0027m crazy, stares at me wide-eyed, in shock. Then he leans back and breaks into loud, mocking laughter. He reaches back and hurls Penelope, and she goes flying through the air, landing hard on the floor.\n \"You\u0027re stupider than I thought,\" he says. \"I shall enjoy watching you die tomorrow.\"\n He turns and marches out the cell, and his people follow, slamming the metal door behind him and locking it. I listen to their boots march away.\n Bree clutches Penelope, kissing her, and Penelope whines back.\n Immediately, the others turn and look at me.\n \"Why did you do that?\" Ben asks sharply. \"Penelope? Seriously? Of all of us? You could\u0027ve had one of us live. Bree. Or Charlie. Anyone. Why did you do that?\" he asks, his frustration rising.\n \"I have a plan,\" I say to him. \"See there? On the far wall?\"\n Everyone turns and looks. There, down the corridor, about fifty feet away, are the keys to all the cells, hanging on hooks.\n I turn and look back at Penelope.\n \"She\u0027s the smartest dog I\u0027ve ever met. She\u0027s our ticket out of here.\"\n I look at Charlie.\n \"Charlie, you said you know the way out.\"\n \"I do!\" he insists, defensive.\n \"I believe you,\" I say. \"If we get out of this cell, can you lead us out?\"\n Charlie nods back vigorously.\n \"I\u0027ve seen the tunnels. I know where they go. There\u0027s a way out, a back way. To the river. There are boats on the river. We could take one.\"\n Ben shakes his head. \"It\u0027s risky,\" he says.\n \"Got any other ideas?\" I ask.\n He looks at me, long and hard, then finally shakes his head. \"Let\u0027s do it.\"\n I turn to Bree.\n \"Bree. Talk to Penelope. She listens to you. Command her. Tell her what to do. Tell her to get us the keys. The ones that we need.\"\n Bree carries Penelope to the edge of the cell, and we all follow. I look both ways, and see no one.\n Bree pulls Penelope close and whispers in her ear.\n \"Penelope, baby. We need your help. Please. You have to get us those keys.\"\n Bree points to the far wall, and Penelope looks over with her one good eye.\n \"Do you understand?\" Bree asks. \"Fetch those keys, and bring them back. Go!\"\n Bree takes a knee and inserts Penelope\u0027s skinny body between the bars, and shoves her into the hall.\n Penelope takes three steps, then stops and turns and looks back at Bree.\n Bree points to the far wall.\n \"Go!\" she hisses.\n Penelope hesitates, then suddenly turns and darts off to the far wall. She runs down the hall, snatches the key ring in her mouth, lifts it off the hook, and races back with it. She runs and runs, slipping between the bars, the keys in her mouth.\n Inside our cell, she drops them in Bree\u0027s palm.\n I can\u0027t believe it. It worked. We are all thrilled and delighted. My heart floods with love and appreciation for the dog.\n Bree hands me the ring, and it is heavy, filled with keys. I immediately flip through them, reach through the bars, and try each one. On the third one in, it turns with a loud, metallic click, and our cell door opens.\n It worked. I can\u0027t believe it worked.\n We all hurry out the cell, Bree grabbing Penelope and holding her inside her jacket.\n \"Charlie, it\u0027s your turn. Which way?\"\n Charlie stands there, looking both ways, hesitating. Then, he turns right.\n \"This way,\" he says, taking off. We follow him, and soon we are all running down the hallways.\n Charlie turns left and right, following the emergency lights, down different tunnels, turning again and again. I can barely keep up with him, and can hardly believe how he\u0027s figured all this out.\n I am beginning to worry if he knows where he\u0027s going when, after several more turns, he comes to a stop before two yellow emergency lights. He goes to a black part of the wall, reaches out, and raps hard with his knuckles. A hollow sound comes back.\n \"This is the door,\" he says. \"I\u0027ve seen them use it. It goes outside. You ready?\"\n The four of us crowd around it, then I yank it open.\n I can\u0027t believe it. We are outside. He\u0027s found it. Charlie was right.\n We are outside the prison complex, at some sort of rear entrance. It is amazing to be out in the open sky again, free.\n It is night time, and the sky is filled with thousands of stars. It is a cold winter night, the temperature dropping again, and we are out in the freezing elements. I still wear my uniform, as do the others, and it provides some protection, but barely enough to keep me warm.\n Charlie points to the river in the distance. It glistens in the moonlight, and I see slaverunner motor boats, bobbing in the water. It is late, and they look unmanned.\n We all break into a sprint, racing across the grass for the river, about a hundred yards away. The ground is iced over, and our footsteps crunch as we run. There are watchtowers all around us, but it is a dark, moonless night, and there are no slaverunners standing guard on this side of the complex.\n As we reach the river\u0027s edge, we head for a motorboat. It is a beautiful, new boat, and it sits there, anchored, no one standing guard. Of course, why would they? We are inside an army complex.\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" I whisper urgently.\n We jump into the boat. As we do, Ben immediately pulls the anchor.\n My heart is pounding as I search for the key, then find it in the ignition. I make sure everyone is seated, then turn it, bracing myself.\n It turns over. I hit the throttle, slow at first. I don\u0027t want to make too much noise until we are beyond the perimeter of the city.\n We are moving, and I look all around us as we go, looking for any sign of being followed. But there are none. It must be very late at night, and no one is watching. I look down and see a full tank of gas. I look around and see the tense faces on my fellow passengers.\n I want to gun it, but I force myself to go slowly, just a few miles an hour, nearly drifting down the river in the dark night. On my right, in the distance, I can see the outline of the arena, of the stadiums, of all the different competing grounds. In the far distance, I see groups of slaverunners, standing guard. But they are far away, and their backs are to us. No one sees us, here in the river, slipping through. Or if they do, they probably just assume we are one of theirs.\n As we get further, the river twists and turns. We are heading north, against the current. As far away from Manhattan as we can get. Towards Canada.\n We continue on, twisting and turning, and when we get far enough where I think it\u0027s safe, I hit the throttle. The engine roars and we gain real speed. We are now racing up this nameless river, going who knows where. I don\u0027t care where. As long as it is far, far from here.\n I can\u0027t get Logan\u0027s and Flo\u0027s faces out of my mind. I feel they are looking down, watching us. And that they are smiling.\n We have made it. We have survived. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/arena-two/page-19.html","bookId":1692,"book":{"id":1692,"title":"Arena Two","description":"Storyline: \n Arena Two (The Survival Trilogy #2) \n Having just escaped from the treacherous island that was once Manhattan, Brooke, Ben, Logan, Bree and Rose make their way up the Hudson river in their stolen boat, low on fuel, low on food, and desperately needing shelter from the cold.
