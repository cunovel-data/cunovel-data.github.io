Can you tell us, where in the blue hell are we?\" Jonesy asked in his usual delicate style.\\n\\n Randi looked around for a long moment, her exotic almond-shaped eyes missing nothing. \"Nope.\"\\n\\n Totally helpful.\\n\\n John had wandered over to the door and was running an exploratory hand over the metal plank that barred the exit. He straightened, turning to the group. \"This is a hand-wrought forging.\"\\n\\n Jonesy threw his hands up in the air. \"English, ya putz!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah John, if ya got some details, barf it out,\" Tiff said, snapping her gum, the noise of it oddly swallowed by the soft walls. John ignored them. Instead, he walked to where the door stopped and pressed his hand into the spongy material of the sphere wall, the depressions held for a few seconds when he took his hand away then it filled in once again.\\n\\n I looked up, noticing small holes dotted the surface randomly. Like the dome had a case of the measles. Were those supposed to be there? I looked at Jade and motioned for her to come over to me. She did, her eyes everywhere while my eyes took in the sight of her. Jade was okay. She should have been, she\u0027d landed on me on the way out. I smiled, nothing but a trampoline guys.\\n\\n John sighed. \"I think I can estimate a time period,\" he put his hand on the back of a bench made of some kind of metal, a weathered green, a spigot for water with a hand pump at its top. He motioned toward the door with his palm. \"It is a turn-of-the-century location.\"\\n\\n Everyone looked at him blankly. He sighed. \"Turn-of-the-last-century,\" he clarified.\\n\\n \"Dude, we\u0027ve traveled back in time?\" Alex quizzed and Randi rolled her eyes, giving him A Look. He shrugged, his massive shoulders moving like a separate entity, their own zip code.\\n\\n \"No! I told you guys, I can\u0027t move through time, only around it.\" We stared at her silently. She tapped her foot. I guess it made sense to her.\\n\\n \"Okay, here\u0027s the thing. I\u0027m a Dimensional, I can visit alternate realities. Worlds that are parallel to ours. This is the dome world. It\u0027s the one I flashed to before they gave me the juice that tore me back to our world.\"\\n\\n Alex jerked a thumb at the gizmo they\u0027d traveled through. \"What\u0027s that then, baby?\"\\n\\n Randi shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know, exactly. It\u0027s like a doorway was already there. Someone has been through here before.\"\\n\\n Parker hadn\u0027t said dick about a doorway. Or how he\u0027d gotten to the dome world. Thanks for the head\u0027s up. Ya putz. But I knew what his answer would have been. He\u0027d have shot his mouth off about how I only needed part of the story or I\u0027d boink up the time-continuum or some crap like that. That was me, keep me in the dark and feed me shit. Like a mushroom.\\n\\n John walked toward her. \"You mean a Dimensional? Someone like you?\"\\n\\n \"No... someone needed that hardware to get here. They didn\u0027t have the juice.\"\\n\\n Tiff snorted in the background.\\n\\n I knew the Graysheets were behind it. It was something they\u0027d do. Screwing around in other people\u0027s stuff... their worlds. Their Business. Up everyone\u0027s asses.\\n\\n Uh-huh.\\n\\n \"So how\u0027d we get here on the Dimensional superhighway?\" Jonesy asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how it works. I just got designated this year. They\u0027re guessing as usual.\"\\n\\n The Adults. Guessing. Go figure. I did another internal smirk.\\n\\n \"I bet mommy dearest loves your new skills,\" Jonesy snickered and Randi scowled.\\n\\n Actually, I knew she was pretty unhappy with Randi at the moment. And it wasn\u0027t just her newfound ability, it was her Body boyfriend. And as Mom would say, the company she kept. Yeah.\\n\\n Alex came to her defense, \"She can\u0027t help who her mom is Jones.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know, but it\u0027s pretty damn funny anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, effing hilarious,\" Randi said, swinging her long black hair behind her shoulder and giving Jonesy the long-suffering look.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get out of here, it\u0027s creepy,\" Jade said, rubbing her hands up and down her arms, her puffy still on. I couldn\u0027t believe she was wearing the hot-ass thing. I was about to strip mine off when Bry and Tiff said, practically at the same moment, \"No!\"\\n\\n They looked at each other, laughing. Tiff said, \"We came all this way to check shit out and I wanna. Plus,\" she pulled everyone in with her intense gaze, \"Hart has to save the day or some shit like that,\" she threw out, rocking back on her heels while she sounded off a bubble burst timed to perfection.\\n\\n I listened to them laugh at Miss Cavalier but I was distracted.\\n\\n I\u0027d felt a familiar pull. Looking through the murky wall of the dome I saw them.\\n\\n Hundreds.\\n\\n Grave markers. The call of the dead a siren\u0027s wail. Just outside the old-fashioned door.\\n\\n My friends saw my face and followed my gaze.\\n\\n John\u0027s brows jerked up to his hairline, his hair a deep bronze in the low light of the sphere tunnel. \"Ah... no, Caleb. No corpses. We don\u0027t have enough info. We don\u0027t know what we\u0027re getting into here. Or where we\u0027re even at!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the glory of it, Terran,\" Jonesy said, \"it\u0027s the surprise factor.\"\\n\\n Tiff and Bry nodded.\\n\\n Sophie piped in, \"That\u0027s just it, what if something bad happens?\" she stated, chewing her bottom lip softly, eyes anxious.\\n\\n Lewis spoke for the first time, \"What could happen? There\u0027s no Graysheets here. And,\" he held up an elegant finger, not a wrinkle or speck of dirt on his clothes, \"if this is an old-fashioned world, they don\u0027t have the technology to be dangerous. They\u0027ll be primitive right?\"\\n\\n He had a point, but a lot of times our excursions defied logic.\\n\\n Utterly.\\n\\n Jade tweaked my sleeve, the sweat from the heat of this place beading on my forehead. I looked at her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a bad feeling about this.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be okay. I mean... look at them all,\" I said, indicating the grave markers, the white crosses standing at attention just outside the dome, their forms slightly obscure because of the material of the dome\u0027s wall.\\n\\n \"Dead are dead, right?\" I said to her with confidence, squeezing her against me, the vanilla smell of Jade mingling with the humid air.\\n\\n Jade nodded reluctantly. She was utterly missing my dose of confidence.\\n\\n I had an arsenal of the dead at my disposal. What could happen?\\n\\n Even Parker\u0027s ambiguous details, my future in the hands of some Precognitive I\u0027d never met, couldn\u0027t faze me.\\n\\n The guys went for the door, itching to escape the hot tunnel.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m gettin\u0027 ass-sweat here guys! Let\u0027s get the hell out of Dodge!\" Jonesy wailed.\\n\\n Sophie rolled her eyes. \"Nice visual Jonesy, so wanted to know that detail.\"\\n\\n \"Okay Princess, you never sweat?\" Jonesy asked, spearing her with his comment and Sophie gaped at him in shock.\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\\n\\n \"No butt hair, doofus,\" Tiff said by way of explanation, spitting her gum out on the dirt floor of the tunnel in a wet blob.\\n\\n \"Oh. My. God. Seriously? Did you just say that?\" Randi asked in disbelief.\\n\\n Tiff shrugged. Dive-bombing her head forward she replied, \"So? I got five brothers. Ass. Hair. Figure it out. It\u0027s like a damn greenhouse effect or some crap like that.\"\\n\\n All the guys were silent. Silently dying.\\n\\n Mia saved it by saying, \"I think that is the least of our concerns.\" She indicated the Door That Would Not Budge.\\n\\n Yeah. Let\u0027s get back on track with something that didn\u0027t skewer the guys.\\n\\n Alex laughed, breaking the awkwardness of anatomical differences. \"I\u0027ll get it, no problem.\" He walked over and jerked the solid brass bar off the hooks that held it. He carefully laid it on the dirt floor of the sphere tunnel. His eyes studied the locks at all four corners and his eyes fell on Archer.\\n\\n \"Get over here and do your Lock-Manipulator mojo, Lewis.\"\\n\\n Archer jogged over, and with a jumping run he leaped, slapping the top locks with the flat of his palm. The tumblers moved, cooperating smoothly with the magic that allowed him to manipulate any lock ever made. In whatever world, apparently.\\n\\n He nailed the ones that restrained the bottom. Alex took hold of the portion of the door that slid along runners of a contrasting metal. He grunted, saying, \"Hell, these have to weigh a ton!\"\\n\\n Literally.\\n\\n Finally, he opened the door and stepped out.\\n\\n I was nailed with the freshest air I\u0027d ever smelled, the coolness of it like drinking a tall glass of ice water, at once refreshing and perfect.\\n\\n Jade gave a small smile and Bry said, \"Tiff, pick that gross gum up.\" He stabbed a finger at the wad languishing in the middle of the tunnel floor, dirt clinging to it like a magnet of apple green goodness.\\n\\n \"Nah, posterity bro. Gives them something to think about.\"\\n\\n Wonderful. Tiff, predictable as usual.\\n\\n We walked outside and the buzz of the dead rose to a chorus. Tiff and I looked at each other. Turning to John I asked, \"Can ya tune-up? I can\u0027t think, pal.\"\\n\\n John scrunched his face together and a well of silence filled my head where the voices of the dead had been, the tide of death receding for the moment.\\n\\n Tiff gave me an uneasy glance. \"What?\" I asked.\\n\\n She lifted a shoulder and everyone that was outside turned to look at whatever was making Tiff uncomfortable. That was noteworthy.\\n\\n Tiff and Jonesy shared that trait, never feeling a minute of discomfort, even when they should have.\\n\\n \"They seemed... sad,\" Tiff said, toeing a strip of the tall grass that had an edging of snow clinging to its base.\\n\\n I turned to the markers, rows upon rows of dead bodies. I nodded in agreement. Their collective voice had that quality.\\n\\n \"Sometimes death is sad, I guess,\" I responded, a sudden melancholy gripping me.\\n\\n \"Death grieves,\" Jade agreed, picking up on my mood, her bare hand held in mine. Her Empath nature boosted our mutual understanding, my feelings a conduit to hers.\\n\\n Mia and Bry stood close together, their bodies touching. She looked around, everyone quiet for once, even Jonesy.\\n\\n A miracle.\\n\\n Mia spoke for us, the mass of graves encircling our group, nearly reaching the crest of the hill where an old forest began.\\n\\n \"Death weeps,\" she said in a quiet voice.\\n\\n I nodded. That was exactly it.\\n\\n Alex went to the door and began to shut it behind us, Archer locking it after it rolled to closure with a musical clang of finality.\\n\\n \"Okay! I give up! This is effing miserable,\" Jonesy railed at the elements. \"It\u0027s colder that a witch\u0027s tit on the shady side of an iceberg!\"\\n\\n I barked out a laugh and replied, \"Sounds like you\u0027ve been hanging around Gramps too long.\"\\n\\n John cocked a brow, huffing it through the woods. We\u0027d walked the better part of a day and were tired, thirsty and hungry. Not in that order.\\n\\n \"Buck up, Jones,\" Bry said, \"we\u0027ll find some kind of watering hole or something....\"\\n\\n Ever-faithful that something would crop up in the wilderness. That was the Weller Motto. At least some things were consistent, even in another world.\\n\\n \"Yeah! That\u0027s the mojo I\u0027m talking about... besides, I\u0027ve got a whole pack of gum!\" Tiff said like she\u0027d discovered the winning lottery ticket.\\n\\n The group let out a collective groan. \"Piss off joy-suckers, more for me then.\" She stalked ahead to where John was. But he\u0027d pulled up short, his hand raised beside his head in the universal \"halt\" gesture.\\n\\n \"Quietly,\" he hissed and us guys got on point just from Terran\u0027s tone of voice alone.\\n\\n Jade stood behind me, peeking out around my body, her hand a warm presence in mine. What could be happening out here in the middle of nowhere?\\n\\n Quite a bit apparently.\\n\\n My eyes scanned between the holes made by the branches and saw close to a hundred men, pretty rough lookin\u0027, with weapons and purpose. Their clothing was a strange combo of jeans, button down shirts and tunics that looked like they were made from... animal hide.\\n\\n Hell... they\u0027d hang those ass clowns out to dry in my world. Wearing dead animals for clothes? Totally whacked. I guess they didn\u0027t work up a sweat about the environment here. Huh.\\n\\n My eyes swept the open meadow, catching sight of a group of four. Two chicks and two guys. One of the men was a ginormous sucker, as tall as Terran and nearly as big as Alex. The other guy was dressed in clothes that were really bizarre too and the small girl had hair so red I could see it clearly from here, the taller girl was muscly lookin\u0027, solid. She had that martial arts look to her, wary. Ready.\\n\\n Then I felt them; their combined energy crashed into me.\\n\\n The dead engulfed the meadow, their bones strewn everywhere in a mass grave, their need to reconnect to a singular body a plea that almost drove me to my knees. Jade felt the echo of it and gasped, snatching her hand away. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-10.html","bookId":2493,"book":{"id":2493,"title":"Death Weeps (Death #5)","description":"Storyline: Death Weeps (Death #5) \\n Caleb faces possible jail time for using Clyde as a undeadly weapon.
