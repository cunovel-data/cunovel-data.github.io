I had to ditch class to be here, Jonesy pulsed and said it was an emergency.\"\\n\\n I shot him a dark look. Should\u0027ve known not to pulse the Jonester. Hell, he always alerts the damn media.\\n\\n \"What, man? It is an emergency! Didn\u0027t Garcia go psycho on everyone\u0027s ass?\" He nodded his head as Mom began to rant about his language. \"Uh-huh, looks like Caleb\u0027s gonna go free. Hey man!\" Jonesy said with a fist-pump, \"this is your get out of jail free card.\"\\n\\n \"Like that old Monopoly game?\" Alex asked, turning bodily with the door still clamped in his hands.\\n\\n Porky came forward. \"Put that door down this instant, young man!\" Alex was mainly a follower and looked for a place for it to go.\\n\\n \"Argh!\" she said and waddled over to where he stood. \"Just... ugh! Lean it up against the wall there,\" she said, pointing a stubby finger to the right of the bench that had been beside the plant.\\n\\n \"Okay, m\u0027am,\" Alex said in a contrite voice as he walked the thing over there and leaned it up against the wall.\\n\\n \"Now I\u0027m going to have to call a repair place and they\u0027re not going to want to come here and fix this on a Friday!\" She swiveled pretty quickly for a hippo and waddled back to the three pulse screens to rant a pulse to the elusive Repair Team.\\n\\n Riley put his hands on his hips, dismissing my group.\\n\\n So much for distraction factor.\\n\\n \"Mr. Hart, you have heard your rights as your attorney presented them to you...\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not been charged with a crime, nor is he in custody,\" Gramps clarified.\\n\\n Riley looked at him. \"Be that as it may, he needs to be verbally apprised of his rights, Mr. O\u0027Brien.\"\\n\\n Was there another way? What... braille?\\n\\n \"As long as it\u0027s a point of clarity and not issuance,\" Gramps said.\\n\\n Riley swung his brows up like a clown (I was waiting for the big red nose to grow). \"You needn\u0027t worry, Mr. O\u0027Brien.\" He made serious eye contact with Gramps. \"It is the position of the Kent Police Department to understand Caleb\u0027s stance with this incident.\"\\n\\n John came forward with a smile. \"Hey Caleb.\"\\n\\n I turned, wondering about his interruption, John was a deliberate dude. I lifted my chin in acknowledgment.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re wanting you not to sue.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t imply that, young man,\" he said eying John, \"not that you\u0027re part of this discussion.\" His eyes gave him away though. Full of worry.\\n\\n \"What if I do?\" I asked, my eyes narrowing on him like lasers.\\n\\n \"Detective Garcia will lose his position in the department and there may be longer-term consequences as well.\"\\n\\n Lewis, who had moved to stand behind him added, \"They\u0027re covering their collective butts.\"\\n\\n Alex grinned and Archer gave him a frown.\\n\\n Riley scowled at them and said, \"This does not involve anyone but the people that were placed at the incident.\"\\n\\n \"I was,\" Jade said, raising the hand that I wasn\u0027t holding.\\n\\n \"Me too,\" Brett said, stepping forward.\\n\\n Howie got the troll face going but had to be part of the noose that had potential to hang me so he piped in with, \"And me.\"\\n\\n Riley returned his gaze to me.\\n\\n \"I want to see Garcia, it\u0027s between him and me,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have a police escort. Then I want an answer,\" he demanded and I felt my blood begin to boil. Not so hard as it had been on simmer since the fun of the morning.\\n\\n Gramps put his calloused hands on his pressed old guy pants. \"Stop commanding and start going along with things, Mr. Riley.\"\\n\\n Riley stared at Gramps and neither blinked. Finally, Riley slid his gaze from Gramps\u0027.\\n\\n \"Come on, I\u0027ll take ya,\" Daniels the cop said.\\n\\n I nodded, looking once at Jade as I walked away, our fingers slipping away from their hold reluctantly.\\n\\n I walked into an office that I recognized as Garcia\u0027s. I immediately noticed how the thing had been stripped bare. Gale\u0027s presence had been sanitized from the room down to the minutest detail. No plant, no photo, no single memento that would have signaled her presence remained. When my eyes went to the desk where Garcia sat, his head was in his hands.\\n\\n \"Garcia,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Go, Caleb,\" he said, \"just go.\"\\n\\n I stood there for a minute then looked at Henry. \"Can ya give us a minute?\"\\n\\n He looked at Garcia then nodded. \"I\u0027ll be right outside this door.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n I waited until he was outside, the door open a crack.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n The silence rolled out. Finally, his head rose, chin first, the eyes swollen and red and I knew he\u0027d shed some tears.\\n\\n \"I loved her, you know.\"\\n\\n What?\\n\\n He stared at me and I made a stab in the dark, \"Who... Gale?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Bobbi.\"\\n\\n WTF, so? He beat on me because of Gale? He saw my confusion and pondered how to elaborate. He stood, walking over to the window, the dirty glass looking out over the parking lot. The sardines in neat rows. He didn\u0027t turn, his back to me.\\n\\n Maybe that was easier.\\n\\n He stood for such a long time I didn\u0027t know if he would ever speak. When he did he startled me and I jumped. \"First, it was Smith.\" He leaned his head against the wood molding that lined the edges of the window. \"I thought we had something special, then she broke it off, turning to that psycho Null.\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t know he was a murderer, Garcia. She\u0027s AFTD, not Empath.\"\\n\\n \"True,\" he said, suddenly spinning around to face me and I fought to not back up, my mind conjuring up the image of that baton.\\n\\n He must have seen my tight expression because he sighed and stuffed his hands in the pockets of his dark blue uniform pants. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you...\" he smacked his hand into his open palm.\\n\\n \"And Gale? What were ya doin\u0027 there?\"\\n\\n He studied me.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he whispered. He straightened, then said, \"I want to show you something.\"\\n\\n Well hell, that came out of nowhere.\\n\\n \"Come here,\" he said, carefully rolling up his sleeve.\\n\\n I approached him warily. But when I saw what was revealed on his forearm, it made every ounce of caution flee.\\n\\n \"You know I wouldn\u0027t strike a woman.\"\\n\\n Before today, I would\u0027ve staked my life on it. His behavior had been so erratic. It hadn\u0027t made sense.\\n\\n But this might explain it all.\\n\\n There was a star-shaped welt on his forearm, angry and swollen.\\n\\n I knew that mark.\\n\\n Our eyes met and locked. \"I think they\u0027re using me,\" he said quietly, scared I wouldn\u0027t believe him.\\n\\n We didn\u0027t need to say who.\\n\\n I jerked out my pulse and thumbed the pad.\\n\\n Music, vintage mix I thought into it.\\n\\n Immediately music from the turn-of-the-century filled the small office and caused Henry to poke his head in the door.\\n\\n \"Everything okay?\" His eyes swept the office and I replied, \"Yeah, it\u0027s cool.\"\\n\\n We talked for ten minutes about what we thought happened, the music effectively muffling our words. Afterward, I ended the discussion with, \"So, whatever underlying emotional crap that\u0027s floating around... gets magnified?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll ask my dad but I think it\u0027s some kind of enhancer.\"\\n\\n \"No... don\u0027t ask him. It may put your folks in danger.\"\\n\\n I thought about what I could do. I knew what this was about. The Graysheets were causing a distraction here locally and making Garcia the scapegoat.\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n \"Listen, I know I\u0027m just a kid to you...\" I began.\\n\\n He held up his palm. \"No, not so much anymore.\"\\n\\n He smiled and I saw the old Garcia, the measured and cool-as-a-cucumber Garcia, sneak out in that look.\\n\\n \"I have a plan.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sometimes your plans are a little extreme.\"\\n\\n I smiled, he didn\u0027t know the half of it. \"Yeah, but I think we can make this work if we do it together.\"\\n\\n I told him what to do and he agreed.\\n\\n \"What about your job?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"You decide how to handle things.\" His back was up against the wall. He\u0027d just placed his trust in a guy that wouldn\u0027t turn seventeen for almost a month.\\n\\n Of course, I wasn\u0027t your typical dude.\\n\\n I already knew what to do, knowing that the Graysheets were on the move just solidified my decisions.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t gonna lie though, I was overwhelmed. The probation was not expired, I was living with Gramps, Garcia was a pawn on the chessboard for the Graysheets, Gale and Clyde faced prejudice at every turn and Brett was a complication that got bigger every day.\\n\\n Hell it loomed.\\n\\n Then there was Howie.\\n\\n Some of what I was thinking must have been on my face because Garcia reached out and squeezed my shoulder. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" His eyes searched my face. \"Tell Bobbi I\u0027m sorry too.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Nah, you\u0027ll see her later, remember?\"\\n\\n He raised his eyebrows. \"Right.\"\\n\\n Yeah, there\u0027d be a surprise guest if I had anything to do with it.\\n\\n \"You ready?\" Henry asked, his hand on the doorknob, cranking it open. He wasn\u0027t really asking, it was just time to go, his eyes flicking to Garcia then back to me.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I am.\"\\n\\n I walked away without looking back.\\n\\n When I entered the lobby of the police station a swarm of guys in coveralls were there, fixing the door frame. A cleaning guy was getting rid of the remnants of the potted plant. It had looked like ass anyway, its absence was an improvement.\\n\\n My group stood at one end of the station while Porky continued to rant through pulse, her thumbs working at the speed of light, a blur of thumbs stabbing on oversized pulse pads.\\n\\n Damn, she got shit done.\\n\\n Riley stood awkwardly but separate from the Parents and Gramps.\\n\\n When I walked out there beside Henry, Riley all but ran to me.\\n\\n \"Well?\" he asked tersely.\\n\\n I took a deep breath, briefly glancing at Mom, Dad and Gramps.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to press charges.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Mom yelled and Dad frowned. Gramps searched my face, seeing things most wouldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Are you sure that\u0027s what you want, Caleb?\" His eyes bored into mine, seeking answers to questions he couldn\u0027t ask in this company.\\n\\n \"Let him make his own decisions,\" Riley said, barely able to contain his glee. He shoved a pulse consent underneath my nose and said, \"Thumb your agreement here.\" He indicated where and I pushed my thumb into the perfect position.\\n\\n Gramps gave me a long look, then when his thumb was hovering over the part that said, Guardian Consent, Mom said, \"Pops, no. He can\u0027t be allowed in a position of authority. This could happen to another teenager, person...\"\\n\\n Gramps met her eyes. \"Have a little faith in your boy, Peanut.\"\\n\\n She tried one last time, \"Maybe he was coerced?\" her eyes pleaded.\\n\\n Dad shook his head. \"I\u0027m with Mac for once, hun.\"\\n\\n Gramps grunted at that and Dad smiled.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s time to trust Caleb\u0027s reasoning, his logic. Technically, he\u0027s already an adult.\"\\n\\n Mom slumped her shoulders in defeat.\\n\\n Gramps pressed his thumb, the pulse glowed a bright green and the color died away to be replaced with the dull black of the pad again.\\n\\n Riley snatched the pulse consent against his chest.\\n\\n Like we\u0027d leap at him and gang-beat him for it. Jerk.\\n\\n The cops looked at me. They weren\u0027t sure why I hadn\u0027t sued the department, gotten Garcia\u0027s ass fired.\\n\\n It was so anti-American not to sue. I got it. But I had bigger fish to fry.\\n\\n I was gonna find Parker. I thought I had a way to do it.\\n\\n I walked out of the station with my friends following. I put up a finger to Gramps and was surrounded by them in a second.\\n\\n It felt like a football huddle.\\n\\n I met everyone\u0027s eyes one at a time. Finally, I told them the loose plan. I pegged Tiff with a stare. \"I\u0027m going to need your help to get Parker to come.\"\\n\\n \"Okey-dokey. We\u0027ll bring the AFTD shit tonight!\" snap-crackle-pop with the gum.\\n\\n Right.\\n\\n Jonesy said, \"When?\"\\n\\n I told him and we broke apart. I looked at everyone. \"This could get real messy. If ya don\u0027t want to...\" I held up my palms and they all nodded.\\n\\n \"Is it gonna be like the dome-world?\" Randi asked, even though she\u0027d been the conjurer of that whole thing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-22.html","bookId":2493,"book":{"id":2493,"title":"Death Weeps (Death #5)","description":"Storyline: Death Weeps (Death #5) \\n Caleb faces possible jail time for using Clyde as a undeadly weapon.
