{"id":13254,"no":56,"title":"LVI BETWEEN THE MILLSTONES","content":"Telegraph! They had been telegraphing for days, but their telegrams have not yet been delivered. \n \n On the evening when the camps of Johnston and Grant with burning Jackson between them put out half the stars a covered carriage, under the unsolicited escort of three or four gray-jacketed cavalrymen and driven by an infantry lad seeking his command after an illness at home, crossed Pearl River in a scow at Ratcliff\u0027s ferry just above the day\u0027s battlefield. \n \n \"When things are this bad,\" said the boy to the person seated beside him and to two others at their back, his allusion being to their self-appointed guard, \"any man you find straggling to the front is the kind a lady can trust.\" \n \n This equipage had come a three hours\u0027 drive, from the pretty town of Brandon, nearest point to which a railway train from the East would venture, and a glimpse into the vehicle would have shown you, behind Constance and beside Miranda, Anna, pale, ill, yet meeting every inquiry with a smiling request to push on. They were attempting a circuit of both armies to reach a third, Pemberton\u0027s, on the Big Black and in and around Vicksburg. \n \n Thus incited they drove on in the starlight over the gentle hills of Madison county and did not accept repose until they had put Grant ten miles behind and crossed to the south side of the Vicksburg and Jackson Railroad at Clinton village with only twenty miles more between them and Big Black Bridge. The springs of Anna\u0027s illness were more in spirit than body. Else she need not have lain sleepless that night at Clinton\u0027s many cross-roads, still confronting a dilemma she had encountered in Mobile. \n \n In Mobile the exiles had learned the true whereabouts of the brigade, and of a battery then called Bartleson\u0027s as often as Kincaid\u0027s by a public which had half forgotten the seemingly well-established fact of Hilary\u0027s death. Therein was no new shock. The new shock had come when, as the three waited for telegrams, they stood before a vast ironclad still on the ways but offering splendid protection from Farragut\u0027s wooden terrors if only it could be completed, yet on which work had ceased for lack of funds though a greater part of the needed amount, already put up, lay idle solely because it could not be dragged up to a total that would justify its outlay. \n \n \"How much does it fall short?\" asked Anna with a heart at full stop, and the pounding shock came when the shortage proved less than the missing proceeds of the bazaar. For there heaved up the problem, whether to pass on in the blind hope of finding her heart\u0027s own, or to turn instead and seek the two detectives and the salvation of a city. This was the dilemma which in the last few days had torn half the life out of her and, more gravely than she knew, was threatening the remnant. \n \n Constance and Miranda yearned, yet did not dare, to urge the latter choice. They talked it over covertly on the back seat of the carriage, Anna sitting bravely in front with the young \"web-foot,\" as their wheels next day plodded dustily westward out of Clinton. Hilary would never be found, of course; and if found how would he explain why he, coming through whatever vicissitudes, he the ever ready, resourceful and daring, he the men\u0027s and ladies\u0027 man in one, whom to look upon drew into his service whoever looked, had for twelve months failed to get so much as one spoken or written word to Anna Callender; to their heart-broken Nan, the daily sight of whose sufferings had sharpened their wits and strung their hearts to blame whoever, on any theory, could be blamed. Undoubtedly he might have some dazzling explanation ready, but that explanation they two must first get of him before she should know that her dead was risen. \n \n Our travellers were minus their outriders now. At dawn the squad, leaving tender apologies in the night\u0027s stopping-place, had left the ladies also, not foreseeing that demoralized servants would keep them there with torturing delays long into the forenoon. When at length the three followed they found highways in ruin, hoof-deep in dust and no longer safe from blue scouts, while their infantry boy proved as innocent of road wisdom as they, and on lonely by-ways led them astray for hours. We may picture their bodily and mental distress to hear, at a plantation house whose hospitality they craved when the day was near its end, that they were still but nine miles from Clinton with eleven yet between them and Big Black Bridge. \n \n Yet they could have wept for thanks as readily as for chagrin or fatigue, so kindly were they taken in, so stirring was the next word of news. \n \n \"Why, you po\u0027 city child\u0027en!\" laughed two sweet unprotected women. \"Let these girls bresh you off. You sho\u0027ly got the hafe o\u0027 Hinds County on you ... Pemberton\u0027s men? Law, no; they wuz on Big Black but they right out here, now, on Champion\u0027s Hill, in sight f\u0027om our gin-house ... Brodnax\u0027 bri\u0027--now, how funny! We jess heard o\u0027 them about a\u0027 hour ago, f\u0027om a bran\u0027 new critter company name\u0027 Ferry\u0027s Scouts. Why, Ferry\u0027s f\u0027om yo\u0027 city! Wish you could \u0027a\u0027 seen him--oh, all of \u0027em, they was that slick! But, oh, slick aw shabby, when our men ah fine they ah fine, now, ain\u0027t they! There was a man ridin\u0027 with him--dressed diff\u0027ent--he wuz the batteredest-lookin\u0027, gayest, grandest--he might \u0027a\u0027 been a gen\u0027al! when in fact he was only a majo\u0027, an\u0027 it was him we heard say that Brodnax was some\u0027uz on the south side o\u0027 the railroad and couldn\u0027t come up befo\u0027 night ... What, us? no, we on the nawth side. You didn\u0027t notice when you recrossed the track back yondeh? Well, you must \u0027a\u0027 been ti-ud!\" \n \n Anna dropped a fervid word to Miranda that set their hostesses agape. \"Now, good Lawd, child, ain\u0027t you in hahdship and dangeh enough? Not one o\u0027 you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 one step fu\u0027ther this day. Do you want to git shot? Grant\u0027s men are a-marchin\u0027 into Bolton\u0027s Depot right now. Why, honey, you might as well go huntin\u0027 a needle in a haystack as to go lookin\u0027 fo\u0027 Brodnax\u0027s brigade to-night. Gen\u0027al Pemberton himself--why, he\u0027d jest send you to his rear, and that\u0027s Vicksburg, where they a-bein\u0027 shelled by the boats day and night, and the women and child\u0027en a-livin\u0027 in caves. You don\u0027t want to go there?\" \n \n \"We don\u0027t know,\" drolly replied Anna. \n \n \"Well, you stay hyuh. That\u0027s what that majo\u0027 told us. Says \u0027e, \u0027Ladies, we got to fight a battle here to-morrow, but yo\u0027-all\u0027s quickest way out of it\u0027ll be to stay right hyuh. There\u0027ll be no place like home to-morrow, not even this place,\u0027 says \u0027e, with a sort o\u0027 twinkle that made us laugh without seein\u0027 anything to laugh at!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62703.html","bookId":440,"book":{"id":440,"title":"Kincaid\u0027s Battery","description":"简介： For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
