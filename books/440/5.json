{"id":13203,"no":5,"title":"V HILARY?--YES, UNCLE?","content":"Second half as well as first, the drill was ended. The low acacias and great live-oaks were casting their longest shadows. The great plain rested from the trample and whirl of hoofs, guns, and simulated battle. A whiff of dust showed where the battery ambled townward among roadside gardens, the Callender carriage spinning by it to hurry its three ladies and Mandeville far away to the city\u0027s lower end. At the column\u0027s head rode Irby in good spirits, having got large solace of Flora\u0027s society since we last saw her paired with Kincaid. Now beside the tiny railway station Hilary was with her once more as she and Charlie awaited the train from town. Out afield were left only General Brodnax and Greenleaf, dismounted between the Northerner\u0027s horse and Hilary\u0027s. Now Kincaid came across the turf. \n \n \"Greenleaf,\" said the old soldier, \"why does Hilary forever walk as though he were bringing the best joke of the season? Can\u0027t you make him quit it?\" \n \n The nephew joined them: \"Uncle, if you\u0027d like to borrow my horse I can go by train.\" \n \n That was a joke. \"H-m-m! I see! No, Greenleaf\u0027s going by train. Would you like to ride with me?\" \n \n \"Well, eh--ha! Why, uncle, I--why, of course, if Fred really--\" They mounted and went. \n \n \"Hilary?\" \n \n \"Yes, uncle?\" \n \n \"How is it now? Like my girl any better?\" \n \n \"Why--yes! Oh, she\u0027s fine! And yet I--\" \n \n \"You must say? What must you say?\" \n \n \"Nothing much; only that she\u0027s not the kind to seem like the owner of a field battery. My goodness! uncle, if she had half Miss Flora\u0027s tang--\" \n \n \"She hasn\u0027t the least need of it! She\u0027s the quiet kind, sir, that fools who love \u0027tang\u0027 overlook!\" \n \n \"Yes,\" laughed Hilary, \"she\u0027s quiet; quiet as a fortification by moonlight! Poor Fred! I wish--\" \n \n \"Well, thank God you wish in vain! That\u0027s just been settled. I asked him--oh, don\u0027t look surprised at me. Good Lord! hadn\u0027t I the right to know?\" \n \n The two rode some way in silence. \"I wish,\" mused the nephew aloud, \"it could be as he wants it.\" \n \n The uncle\u0027s smile was satirical: \"Did you ever, my boy, wish anything could be as I want it?\" \n \n \"Now, uncle, there\u0027s a big difference--\" \n \n \"DAMN THE DIFFERENCE! I\u0027m going to try you. I\u0027m going to make Adolphe my adjutant-general. Then if you hanker for this battery as it hankers for you--\" \n \n \"Mary, Queen of Scots!\" rejoiced Hilary. \"That\u0027ll suit us both to the bone! And if it suits you too--\" \n \n \"Well it doesn\u0027t! You know I\u0027ve never wanted Adolphe about me. But you\u0027ve got me all snarled up, the whole kit of you. What\u0027s more, I don\u0027t want him for my heir nor any girl with \u0027tang\u0027 for mistress of my lands and people. Hilary, I swear! if you\u0027ve got the sand to want Anna and she\u0027s got the grace to take you, then, adjutant-general or not, I\u0027ll leave you my whole fortune! Well, what amuses you now?\" \n \n \"Why, uncle, all the cotton in New Orleans couldn\u0027t tempt me to marry the girl I wouldn\u0027t take dry so without a continental cent.\" \n \n \"But your own present poverty might hold you back even from the girl you wanted, mightn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"No!\" laughed the nephew, \"nothing would!\" \n \n \"Good God! Well, if you\u0027ll want Anna I\u0027ll make it easy for you to ask for her. If not, I\u0027ll make it as hard as I can for you to get any one else.\" \n \n Still Hilary laughed: \"H-oh, uncle, if I loved any girl, I\u0027d rather have her without your estate than with it.\" Suddenly he sobered and glowed: \"I wish you\u0027d leave it to Adolphe! He\u0027s a heap-sight better business man than I. Besides, being older, he feels he has the better right to it. You know you always counted on leaving it to him.\" \n \n The General looked black: \"You actually decline the gift?\" \n \n \"No. No, I don\u0027t. I want to please you. But of my own free choice I wouldn\u0027t have it. I\u0027m no abolitionist, but I don\u0027t want that kind of property. I don\u0027t want the life that has to go with it. I know other sorts that are so much better. I\u0027m not thinking only of the moral responsibility--\" \n \n \"By--! sir, I am!\" \n \n \"I know you are, and I honor you for it.\" \n \n \"Bah!... Hilary, I--I\u0027m much obliged to you for your company, but--\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve had enough,\" laughed the good-natured young man. \"Good-evening, sir.\" He took a cross-street. \n \n \"Good-evening, my boy.\" The tone was so kind that Hilary cast a look back. But the General\u0027s eyes were straight before him. \n \n Greenleaf accompanied the Valcours to their door. Charlie, who disliked him, and whose admiration for his own sister was privately cynical, had left them to themselves in the train. There, wholly undetected by the very man who had said some women were too feminine and she was one, she had played her sex against his with an energy veiled only by its intellectual nimbleness and its utterly dispassionate design. Charlie detected achievement in her voice as she twittered good-by to the departing soldier from their street door. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62652.html","bookId":440,"book":{"id":440,"title":"Kincaid\u0027s Battery","description":"简介： For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
