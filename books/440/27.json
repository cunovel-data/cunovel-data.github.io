{"id":13225,"no":27,"title":"XXVII HARD GOING, UP STREAM","content":"Very pleasant it was to stand thus on the tremulous deck of the swiftest craft in the whole Confederate service. Pleasant to see on either hand the flat landscape with all its signs of safety and plenty; its orange groves, its greening fields of young sugar-cane, its pillared and magnolia-shaded plantation houses, its white lines of slave cabins in rows of banana trees, and its wide wet plains swarming with wild birds; pleasant to see it swing slowly, majestically back and melt into a skyline as low and level as the ocean\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Anna and Kincaid went inside to see the upper and more shining portions of the boat\u0027s beautiful machinery. No one had yet made rods, cranks, and gauge-dials sing anthems; but she knew it was Hilary and an artisan or two in his foundry whose audacity in the remaking of these gliding, plunging, turning, vanishing, and returning members had given them their fine new speed-making power, and as he stood at her side and pointed from part to part they took on a living charm that was reflected into him. Pleasant it was, also, to hear two or three droll tales about his battery boys; the personal traits, propensities, and soldierly value of many named by name, and the composite character and temper that distinguished the battery as a command; this specific quality of each particular organic unit, fighting body, among their troops being as needful for commanders to know as what to count on in the individual man. So explained the artillerist while the pair idled back to the open deck. With hidden vividness Anna liked the topic. Had not she a right, the right of a silent partner? A secret joy of the bond settled on her like dew on the marshes, as she stood at his side. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hilary loved the theme. The lives of those boys were in his hands; at times to be hoarded, at times to be spent, in sudden awful junctures to be furiously squandered. He did not say this, but the thought was in both of them and drew them closer, though neither moved. The boat rounded to, her engines stopped, an officer came aboard from a skiff, and now she was under way again and speeding up stream on her return, but Hilary and Anna barely knew it. He began to talk of the boys\u0027 sweethearts. Of many of their tender affairs he was confidentially informed. Yes, to be frank, he confessed he had prompted some fellows to let their hearts lead them, and to pitch in and win while-- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! certainly!\" murmured Anna in compassion, \"some of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said their captain, \"but they are chaps--like Charlie--whose hearts won\u0027t keep unless they\u0027re salted down and barrelled, and I give the advice not in the sweethearts\u0027 interest but--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not? Why shouldn\u0027t a--\" The word hung back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A lover?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. Why shouldn\u0027t he confess himself in her interest? That needn\u0027t pledge her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! do you think that would be fair?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perfectly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, now--take an actual case. Do you think the mere fact that Adolphe truly and stick-to-it-ively loves Miss Flora gives her a right to know it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do, and to know it a long, long time before he can have any right to know whether--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hum! while he goes where glory waits him--?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And lets time--?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And absence and distance and rumor try his unsupported constancy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With tight lips the soldier drew breath. \"You know my uncle expects now to be sent to Virginia at once?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Adolphe, of course, goes with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yet you think--the great principle of so-much-for-so-much to the contrary notwithstanding--he really owes it to her to--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Anna moved a step forward. She was thinking what a sweet babe she was, thus to accept the surface of things. How did she know that this laughing, light-spoken gallant, seemingly so open and artless--oh! more infantile than her very self!--was not deep and complex? Or that it was not he and Flora on whose case she was being lured to speculate? The boat, of whose large breathings and pulsings she became growingly aware, offered no reply. Presently from the right shore, off before them, came a strain of band music out of Camp Callender. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Anna.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What hosts of stars!\" said she. \"How hoveringly they follow us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The lover waited. The ship seemed to breathe deeper--to glide faster. He spoke again: \"May I tell you a secret?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t the boat appear to you to tremble more than ever?\" was the sole response. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, she\u0027s running up-stream. So am I. Anna, we\u0027re off this time--sure shot--with the General--to Virginia. The boys don\u0027t know it yet, but--listen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Over in the unseen camp the strain was once more-- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d offer thee this hand of mine--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re turning in to be landed, are we not?\" asked Anna as the stars began to wheel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. Do you really believe, Anna, that that song is not the true word for a true lover and true soldier, like Adolphe, for instance--to say to himself, of course, not to her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Captain Kincaid, what does it matter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Worlds to me. Anna, if I should turn that song into a solemn avowal--to you--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t!--Oh, I mean--I don\u0027t mean--I--I mean--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, I know your meaning. But if I love you, profoundly, abidingly, consumingly--as I do, Anna Callender, as I do!--and am glad to pledge my soul to you knowing perfectly that you have nothing to confess to me--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t, Captain Kincaid, don\u0027t! You are not fair to me. You make me appear--oh--we were speaking only of your cousin\u0027s special case. I don\u0027t want your confession. I\u0027m not ready for--for anybody\u0027s! You mustn\u0027t make it! You--you--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s made, Anna Callender, and it makes me fair to you at last.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh-h-h!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that matters little to you--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but you\u0027re farther from fair than ever, Captain Kincaid; you got my word for one thing and have used it for another!\" She turned and they tardily followed their friends, bound for the gangway. A torch-basket of pine-knots blazing under the bow covered flood and land with crimson light and inky shadows. The engines had stopped. The boat swept the shore. A single stage-plank lay thrust half out from her forward quarter. A sailor stood on its free end with a coil of small line. The crouching earthwork and its fierce guns glided toward them. Knots of idle cannoneers stood along its crest. A few came down to the water\u0027s edge, to whom Anna and Hilary, still paired alone, were a compelling sight. They lifted their smart red caps. Charlie ventured a query: \"It\u0027s true, Captain, isn\u0027t it, that Virginia\u0027s out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve not seen her,\" was the solemn reply, and his comrades tittered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes!\" called Constance and Miranda, \"she\u0027s out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Anna,\" murmured Hilary with a meekness it would have avenged Charlie to hear, \"I\u0027ve only given you the right you claim for every woman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Captain Kincaid, I didn\u0027t say every woman! I took particular--I--I mean I--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If it\u0027s any one\u0027s right it\u0027s yours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want it!--I mean--I mean--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean, do you not? that I\u0027ve no right to say what can only distress you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think you have?--Oh, Lieutenant, it\u0027s been a perfectly lovely trip! I don\u0027t know when the stars have seemed so bright!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re not like us dull men, Miss Callender,\" was the sailor\u0027s unlucky reply, \"they can rise to any occasion a lady can make.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ladies don\u0027t make occasions, Lieutenant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t they!\" laughed the sea-dog to Hilary. But duty called. \"No, no, Miss Val--! Don\u0027t try that plank alone! Captain Kincaid, will you give--? That\u0027s right, sir.... Now, Captain Irby, you and Miss Callender--steady!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Seventh and last went the frail old lady, led by Kincaid. She would have none other. She kept his arm with definite design while all seven waved the departing vessel good-by. Then for the walk to the house she shared Irby with Anna and gave Flora to Hilary, with Miranda and Constance in front outmanoeuvred by a sleight of hand so fleeting and affable that even you or I would not have seen it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62674.html","bookId":440,"book":{"id":440,"title":"Kincaid\u0027s Battery","description":"简介： For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
