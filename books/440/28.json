{"id":13226,"no":28,"title":"XXVIII THE CUP OF TANTALUS","content":"Queer world. Can you be sure the next pair you meet walking together of a summer eve are as starry as they look? Lo, Constance and Miranda. Did the bride herself realize what a hunger of loneliness was hers? Or Anna and Irby, with Madame between them. Could you, maybe, have guessed the veritable tempest beneath the maiden\u0027s serenity, or his inward gnashings against whatever it was that had blighted his hour with the elusive Flora? \n \n Or can any one say, in these lives of a thousand concealments and restraints, when things are happening and when not, within us or without, or how near we are now to the unexpected--to fate? See, Flora and Hilary. He gave no outward show that he was burning to flee the spot and swing his fists and howl and tear the ground. \n \n Yet Flora knew; knew by herself; by a cold rage in her own fair bosom, where every faculty stood gayly alert for each least turn of incident, to foil or use it, while they talked lightly of Virginia\u0027s great step, or of the night\u0027s loveliness, counting the stars. \"How small they look,\" she said, \"how calm how still.\" \n \n \"Yes, and then to think what they really are! so fearfully far from small--or cold--or still!\" \n \n \"Like ourselves,\" she prompted. \n \n \"Yes!\" cried the transparent soldier. \"At our smallest the smallest thing in us is that we should feel small. And how deep down are we calm or cold? Miss Flora, I once knew a girl--fine outside, inside. Lovers -she had to keep a turnstile. I knew a pair of them. To hear those two fellows separately tell what she was like, you couldn\u0027t have believed them speaking of the same person. The second one thought the first had--sort o\u0027--charted her harbor for him; but when he came to sail in, \u0027pon my soul, if every shoal on the chart wasn\u0027t deep water, and every deep water a fortified shore--ha, ha, ha!\" \n \n Flora\u0027s smile was lambent. \"Yes,\" she said, \"that sweet Anna she\u0027s very intric-ate.\" Hilary flamed and caught his breath, but she met his eyes with the placidity of the sky above them. \n \n Suddenly he laughed: \"Now I know what I am! Miss Flora, I--I wish you\u0027d be my pilot.\" \n \n She gave one resenting sparkle, but then shook her averted head tenderly, murmured \"Impossible,\" and smiled. \n \n \"You think there\u0027s no harbor there?\" \n \n \"Listen,\" she said. \n \n \"Yes, I hear it, a horse.\" \n \n \"Captain Kincaid?\" \n \n \"Miss Flora?\" \n \n \"For dear Anna\u0027s sake and yours, shall I be that little bit your pilot, to say--?\" \n \n \"What! to say. Don\u0027t see her to-night?\" \n \n Flora\u0027s brow sank. \n \n \"May I go with you, then, and learn why?\" The words were hurried, for a horseman was in front and the others had so slackened pace that all were again in group. Anna caught Flora\u0027s reply: \n \n \"No, your cousin will be there. But to-morrow evening, bif-ore--\" \n \n \"Yes,\" he echoed, \"before anything else. I\u0027ll come. Why!\"--a whinny of recognition came from the road--\"why, that\u0027s my horse!\" \n \n The horseman dragged in his rein. Constance gasped and Kincaid exclaimed, \"Well! since when and from where, Steve Mandeville?\" \n \n The rider sprang clanking to the ground and whipped out a document. All pressed round him. He gave his bride two furious kisses, held her in one arm and handed the missive to Kincaid: \n \n \"With the compliment of Général Brodnax!\" \n \n Irby edged toward Flora, drawn by a look. \n \n Hilary spoke: \"Miss Anna, please hold this paper open for me while I--Thank you.\" He struck a match. The horse\u0027s neck was some shelter and the two pressed close to make more, yet the match flared. The others listened to Mandeville: \n \n \"And \u0027twas me dizcover\u0027 that tranzportation, juz\u0027 chanzing to arrive by the railroad--\" \n \n \"Any one got a newspaper?\" called Hilary. \"Steve--yes, let\u0027s have a wisp o\u0027 that.\" \n \n The paper burned and Hilary read. \"Always the man of the moment, me!\" said Mandeville. \"And also \u0027t is thangs to me you are the firs\u0027 inform\u0027, and if you are likewise the firs\u0027 to ripport--\" \n \n \"Thank you!\" cried Kincaid, letting out a stirrup leather. \"Adolphe, will you take that despatch on to Bartleson?\" He hurried to the other stirrup. \n \n \"Tell him no!\" whispered Flora, but in vain, so quickly had Anna handed Irby the order. \n \n \"Good-night, all!\" cried Hilary, mounting. He wheeled, swung his cap and galloped. \n \n \"Hear him!\" laughed Miranda to Flora, and from up the dim way his song came back: \n \n \"\u0027I can\u0027t stand the wilderness \n But a few days, a few days.\u0027\" \n \n Still swinging his cap he groaned to himself and dropped his head, then lifted it high, shook his locks like a swimmer, and with a soft word to his horse sped faster. \n \n \"Yo\u0027 pardon, sir,\" said Mandeville to Irby, declining the despatch, \"I wou\u0027n\u0027t touch it. For why he di\u0027n\u0027 h-ask me? But my stable is juz yondeh. Go, borrow you a horse--all night \u0027f you like.\" \n \n Thence Irby galloped to Bartleson\u0027s tent, returned to Callender House, dismounted and came up the steps. There stood Anna, flushed and eager, twining arms with the placid Flora. \"Ah,\" said the latter, as he offered her his escort home, \"but grandma and me, we--\" \n \n Anna broke in: \"They\u0027re going to stay here all night so that you may ride at once to General Brodnax. Even we girls, Captain Irby, must do all we can to help your cousin get away with the battery, the one wish of his heart!\" She listened, untwined and glided into the house. \n \n Instantly Flora spoke: \"Go, Adolphe Irby, go! Ah, snatch your luck, you lucky--man! Get him away to-night, cost what cost!\" Her fingers pushed him. He kissed them. She murmured approvingly, but tore them away: \"Go, go, go-o!\" \n \n Anna, pacing her chamber, with every gesture of self-arraignment and distress, heard him gallop. Then standing in her opened window she looked off across the veranda\u0027s balustrade and down into the camp, where at lines of mess-fires like strings of burning beads the boys were cooking three days\u0027 rations. A tap came on her door. She snatched up a toilet brush: \"Come in?\" \n \n She was glad it was only Flora. \"Chérie,\" tinkled the visitor, \"they have permit\u0027 me!\" \n \n Anna beamed. \"I was coming down,\" she recklessly replied, touching her temples at the mirror. \n \n \"Yes,\" said the messenger, \"\u0027cause Mandeville he was biggening to tell about Fort Sumter, and I asked them to wait--ah\"--she took Anna\u0027s late pose in the window--\"how plain the camp!\" \n \n \"Yes,\" responded Anna with studied abstraction, \"when the window happens to be up. It\u0027s so warm to-night, I--\" \n \n \"Ah, Anna!\" \n \n \"What, dear?\" In secret panic Anna came and looked out at Flora\u0027s side caressingly. \n \n \"At last,\" playfully sighed the Creole, \"\u0027tis good-by, Kincaid\u0027s Battery. Good-by, you hun\u0027red good fellows, with yo\u0027 hun\u0027red horses and yo\u0027 hun\u0027red wheels and yo\u0027 hun\u0027red hurras.\" \n \n \"And hundred brave, true hearts!\" said Anna. \n \n \"Yes, and good-by, Bartleson, good-by, Tracy, good-by ladies\u0027 man!--my dear, tell me once more! For him why always that name?\" Both laughed. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know, unless it\u0027s because--well--isn\u0027t it--because every lady has a piece of his heart and--no one wants all of it?\" \n \n \"Ah! no one?--when so many?--\" \n \n \"Now, Flora, suppose some one did! What of it, if he can\u0027t, himself, get his whole heart together to give it to any one?\" The arguer offered to laugh again, but Flora was sad: \n \n \"You bil-ieve he\u0027s that way--Hilary Kincaid?\" \n \n \"There are men that way, Flora. It\u0027s hard for us women to realize, but it\u0027s true!\" \n \n \"Ah, but for him! For him that\u0027s a dreadful!\" \n \n \"Why, no, dear, I fancy he\u0027s happiest that way.\" \n \n \"But not best, no! And there\u0027s another thing--his uncle! You know ab-out that, I su\u0027pose?\" \n \n \"Yes, but he--come, they\u0027ll be sending--\" \n \n \"No,--no! a moment! Anna! Ah, Anna, you are too wise for me! Anna, do you think\"--the pair stood in the room with the inquirer\u0027s eyes on the floor--\"you think his cousin is like that?\" \n \n Anna kissed her temples, one in pity, the other in joy: \"No, dear, he\u0027s not--Adolphe Irby is not.\" \n \n On the way downstairs Flora seized her hands: \"Oh, Anna, like always--this is just bit-win us? Ah, yes. And, oh, I wish you\u0027d try not to bil-ieve that way--ab-out his cousin! Me, I hope no! And yet--\" \n \n \"Yet what, love?\" (Another panic.) \n \n \"Nothing, but--ah, he\u0027s so ki-ind to my brother! And his cousin Adolphe,\" she whispered as they moved on down, \"I don\u0027t know, but I fear perchanze he don\u0027t like his cousin Adolphe--his cousin Adolphe--on the outside, same as the General, rough--\u0027t is a wondrous how his cousin Adolphe is fond of him!\" \n \n Poor Anna. She led the way into the family group actually wheedled into the belief that however she had blundered with her lover, with Flora she had been clever. And now they heard the only true account of how Captain Beauregard and General Steve had taken Fort Sumter. At the same time every hearer kept one ear alert toward the great open windows. Yet nothing came to explain that Kincaid\u0027s detention up-town was his fond cousin\u0027s contriving, and Sumter\u0027s story was at its end when all started at once and then subsided with relief as first the drums and then the bugles sounded--no alarm, but only, drowsily, \"taps,\" as if to say to Callender House as well as to the camp, \"Go to slee-eep ... Go to slee-eep ... Go to bed, go to bed, go to slee-eep ... Go to slee-eep, go to slee-eep ... Go to slee-ee-eep.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62675.html","bookId":440,"book":{"id":440,"title":"Kincaid\u0027s Battery","description":"简介： For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
