{"id":13205,"no":7,"title":"VII BY STARLIGHT","content":"\"Wait,\" murmured Greenleaf, as they halted to view the scene. From their far right came the vast, brimming river, turbid, swift, silent, its billows every now and then rising and looking back as if they fled from implacable pursuers; sweeping by long, slumbering ranks of ships and steamboats; swinging in majestic breadth around the bend a mile or more below; and at the city\u0027s end, still beyond, gliding into mystic oblivion. Overhead swarmed the stars and across the flood came faintly the breath of orange-groves, sea-marshes and prairies. Greenleaf faced across the wide bend at his left. In that quarter, quite hidden in live-oaks and magnolias, as both well knew, were the low, red towers of Jackson Barracks. But it was not for them the evicted young soldier claimed this last gaze. It was for a large dwelling hard by them, a fine old plantation house with wide verandas, though it also was shut from view, in its ancient grove. \"Fred,\" said Hilary, \"didn\u0027t she tell you why?\" \"No,\" replied the lover when they had turned away and were moving up the harbor front, \"except that it isn\u0027t because I\u0027m for the union.\" Hilary\u0027s eyes went wide: \"That\u0027s wonderful, old man! But I don\u0027t believe she likes a soldier of any sort. If I were a woman I\u0027d be doggoned if I\u0027d ever marry a soldier!\" \"Yet the man who gets her,\" said Greenleaf, \"ought to be a soldier in every drop of his blood. You don\u0027t know her yet; but you soon will, and I\u0027m glad.\" \"Now, why so? I can\u0027t ever please her enough to be pleased with her. I\u0027m too confounded frivolous! I love nonsense, doggon it, for its own sake! I love to get out under a sky like this and just reel and whoop in the pure joy of standing on a world that\u0027s whirling round!\" \"But you do please her. She\u0027s told me so.\" \"Don\u0027t you believe her! I don\u0027t. I can\u0027t. I tell you, Fred, I could never trust a girl that forever looks so trustworthy! S\u0027pose I should fall in love with her! Would you--begrudge her to me?\" \"I bequeath her to you.\" \"Ah! you know I haven\u0027t the ghost of a chance! She\u0027s not for po\u0027 little Hil\u0027ry. I never did like small women, anyhow!\" \"My boy! If ever you like this one she\u0027ll no more seem small than the open sea.\" \"I suppose,\" mused Hilary, \"that\u0027s what makes it all the harder to let go. If a girl has a soul so petty that she can sit and hear you through to the last word your heart can bleed, you can turn away from her with some comfort of resentment, as if you still had a remnant of your own stature.\" \"Precisely!\" said the lover. \"But when she\u0027s too large-hearted to let you speak, and yet answers your unspoken word, once for all, with a compassion so modest that it seems as if it were you having compassion on her, she\u0027s harder to give up than--\" \"Doggon her, Fred, I wouldn\u0027t give her up!\" \"Ah, this war, Hilary! I may never see her again. There\u0027s just one man in this world whom--\" \"Oh, get out!\" \"I mean what I say. To you I leave her.\" \"Ha, ha! No, you don\u0027t! It\u0027s only to her you leave me. Old boy, promise me! If you ever come back and she\u0027s still in the ring, you\u0027ll go for her again no matter who else is bidding, your humble servant not excepted.\" \"Why--yes--I--I promise that. Now, will you promise me?\" \"What! let myself--?\" \"Yes.\" \"Ho-o, not by a jug-full! If ever I feel her harpoon in me I\u0027ll fight like a whale! But I promise you this, and warn you, too: That when it comes to that, a whole platoon of Fred Greenleafs between her and me won\u0027t make a pinch of difference.\" To that Greenleaf agreed, and the subject was changed. With shipping ever on their left and cotton-yards and warehouses for tobacco and for salt on their right their horses\u0027 feet clinked leisurely over the cobble pavements, between thousands of cotton-bales headed upon the unsheltered wharves and only fewer thousands on the narrow sidewalks. So passed the better part of an hour before they were made aware, by unmistakable odors, that they were nearing the Stock-Landing. There, while they were yet just a trifle too far away to catch its echoes, had occurred an incident--a fracas, in fact--some of whose results belong with this narrative to its end. While they amble toward the spot let us reconnoitre it. Happily it has long been wiped out, this blot on the city\u0027s scutcheon. Its half-dozen streets were unspeakable mud, its air was stenches, its buildings were incredibly foul slaughter-houses and shedded pens of swine, sheep, beeves, cows, calves, and mustang ponies. The plank footways were enclosed by stout rails to guard against the chargings of long-horned cattle chased through the thoroughfares by lasso-whirling \"bull-drivers\" as wild as they. In the middle of the river-front was a ferry, whence Louisiana Avenue, broad, treeless, grassy, and thinly lined with slaughter-houses, led across the plain. Down this untidy plaisance a grimy little street-car, every half-hour, jogged out to the Carrollton railway and returned. This street and the water-front were lighted--twilighted--with lard-oil lamps; the rest of the place was dark. At each of the two corners facing the ferry was a \"coffee-house\"--dram-shop, that is to say. Messrs. Sam Gibbs and Maxime Lafontaine were president and vice-president of that Patriots\u0027 League against whose machinations our two young men had been warned by the detectives in St. Charles Street. They had just now arrived at the Stock-Landing. Naturally, on so important an occasion they were far from sober; yet on reaching the spot they had lost no time in levying on a Gascon butcher for a bucket of tar and a pillow of feathers, on an Italian luggerman for a hurried supper of raw oysters, and on the keeper of one of the \"coffee-houses\" for drinks for the four. \"Us four and no more!\" sang the gleeful Gibbs; right number to manage a delicate case. The four glasses emptied, he had explained that all charges must be collected, of course, from the alien gentleman for whom the plumage and fixative were destined. Hence a loud war of words, which the barkeeper had almost smoothed out when the light-hearted Gibbs suddenly decreed that the four should sing, march, pat and \"cut the pigeon-wing\" to the new song (given nightly by Christy\u0027s Minstrels) entitled \"Dixie\u0027s Land.\" Hot threats recurring, Gascony had turned to go, Maxime had headed him off, Italy\u0027s hand had started into his flannel shirt, and \"bing! bang! pop!\" rang Gibbs\u0027s repeater and one of Maxime\u0027s little derringers--shot off from inside his sack-coat pocket. A whirlwind of epithets filled the place. Out into the stinking dark leaped Naples and Gascony, and after them darted their whooping assailants. The shutters of both barrooms clapped to, over the way a pair of bull-drivers rushed to their mustangs, there was a patter of hoofs there and of boots here and all inner lights vanished. A watchman\u0027s rattle buzzed remotely. Then silence reigned. Now Sam and Maxime, deeming the incident closed, were walking up the levee road beyond the stock-pens, in the new and more sympathetic company of the two mounted bull-drivers, to whose love of patriotic adventure they had appealed successfully. A few yards beyond a roadside pool backed by willow bushes they set down tar-bucket and pillow, and under a low, vast live-oak bough turned and waited. A gibbous moon had set, and presently a fog rolled down the river, blotting out landscape and stars and making even these willows dim and unreal. Ideal conditions! Now if their guest of honor, with or without his friend, would but stop at this pool to wash the Stock-Landing muck from his horse\u0027s shins--but even luck has its limits. Nevertheless, that is what occurred. A hum of voices--a tread of hoofs--and the very man hoped for--he and Hilary Kincaid--recognized by their voices--d at the pool\u0027s margin. Sam and Maxime stole forward.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62654.html","bookId":440,"book":{"id":440,"title":"Kincaid\u0027s Battery","description":"简介： For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
