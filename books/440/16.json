{"id":13214,"no":16,"title":"XVI CONSTANCE TRIES TO HELP","content":"One day, in Canal Street, Kincaid met \"Smellemout and Ketchem.\" It was pleasant to talk with men of such tranquil speech. He proposed a glass of wine, but just then they were \"strictly temperance.\" They alluded familiarly to his and Greenleaf\u0027s midnight adventure. The two bull-drivers, they said, were still unapprehended. Dropping to trifles they mentioned a knife, a rather glittering gewgaw, which, as evidence, ought-- \"Oh, that one!\" said Hilary. \"Yes, I have it, mud, glass jewels and all. No,\" he laughed, \"I can keep it quite as safely as you can.\" So they passed to a larger matter. \"For, really, as to Gibbs and Lafontaine--\" \"You can\u0027t have them either,\" interrupted their Captain, setting the words to a tune. Then only less melodiously--\"No, sir-ee! Why, gentlemen, they weren\u0027t trying to kill the poor devil, he was trying to kill them, tell your Committee of Public Safety. And tell them times are changed. You can take Sam and Maxime, of course, if you can take the whole battery; we\u0027re not doing a retail business. By the by--did you know?--\u0027twas Sam\u0027s gun broke the city\u0027s record, last week, for rapid firing! Funny, isn\u0027t it!--Excuse me, I must speak to those ladies.\" The ladies, never prettier, were Mrs. Callender and Constance. They were just reentering, from a shop, their open carriage. In amiable reproach they called him a stranger, yet with bewitching resignation accepted and helped out his lame explanations. \"You look--\" began Constance--but \"careworn\" was a risky term and she stopped. He suggested \"weather-beaten,\" and the ladies laughed. \"Yes,\" they said, \"even they were overtasked with patriotic activities, and Anna had almost made herself ill. Nevertheless if he would call he should see her too. Oh, no, not to-day; no, not to-morrow; but--well-- the day after.\" (Miss Valcour passed so close as to hear the appointment, but her greeting smile failed to draw their attention.) \"And oh, then you must tell us all about that fearful adventure in which you saved Lieutenant Greenleaf\u0027s life! Ah, we\u0027ve heard, just heard, in a letter.\" The horses danced with impatience. \"We shall expect you!\" As they drove into Royal Street with Constance rapturously pressing Miranda\u0027s hand the latter tried vainly to exchange bows with a third beauty and a second captain, but these were busy meeting each other in bright surprise and espied the carriage only when it had passed. Might the two not walk together a step or so? With pleasure. They were Flora and Irby. Presently-- \"Do you know,\" she asked, \"where your cousin proposes to be day after to-morrow evening--in case you should want to communicate with him?\" He did not. She told him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62663.html","bookId":440,"book":{"id":440,"title":"Kincaid\u0027s Battery","description":"简介： For the scene of this narrative please take into mind a wide quarter-circle of country, such as any of the pretty women we are to know in it might have covered on the map with her half-opened fan....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
