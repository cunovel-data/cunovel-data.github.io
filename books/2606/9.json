{"id":98149,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"A porcupine. IsoldA Yes, that\u0027s it. A porcupine sitting on a bronze tree-stump with water flowing out from it in all directions, as though the beast had suffered bad fright. And the snake is coiled up creeping towards the stump and shooting out a tall jet of water that divides into three branches and falls like rain on the porcupine and everything all around. It\u0027s an incredibly beautiful fountain. The first time I saw it there was a little rainbow suspended in the spray of water beside it, and from that moment on I loved it best of all. There are actually three jets of water, but with different pressures. Their nozzles are set close beside each other in the snake\u0027s mouth, so it looks as though there\u0027s one jet rising into the air and three falling downwards. And I remembered the tattoo on your wrist, the oil and the yachtclub. Does the jet you can see above the bushes divide into three? Romeo-y-Cohiba Yes, I think so. IsoldA Aren\u0027t you absolutely sure? Romeo-y-Cohiba I can see a jet of water and the roof of a house when I climb up on to a bench and stand on the back of it. But it\u0027s not possible to stand up there like that for very long, you sway backwards and forwards and then you lose your balance and you have to jump down. That makes it hard to make out the details. But if it is the same fountain you should see my labyrinth when you stand beside it. IsoldA There\u0027s a tall hedge beside the fountain with the snake and the porcupine and I can\u0027t tell what\u0027s behind it. It\u0027s very long - I walked a little way along it, the bushes fence off a large section of park. I think that must be your enclosure. Romeo-y-Cohiba If you\u0027ve walked along that hedge, at one moment we might only have been ten feet apart. I was beside it too, on my own side. I\u0027m practically certain it was the outside hedge. In the first place, there were two rows of barbed fencing instead of just one in the bushes. And in the second place, there\u0027s a spot where you can clearly hear the sound of falling water. Oh and, by the way, beside the spot with the sound of water there\u0027s a long wall protruding from the bushes. It looks like the back of some building and it\u0027s painted with pink and gold Cupids blowing seashells like trumpets. Have you got anything like that? IsoldA There is a single-storey building to the right of the fountain. It looks like a pavilion for storing garden tools, except that it\u0027s very big. Its back section disappears into the high hedge. But I didn\u0027t see any Cupids on it. Romeo-y-Cohiba Can you get inside? IsoldA The door\u0027s locked. Is there a door in your wall? Romeo-y-Cohiba Yes. IsoldA Does it open? Romeo-y-Cohiba To be honest I didn\u0027t try it. I stood beside it for a while and suddenly I felt terrified, I even got a pounding in my temples. I\u0027m not the timid type at all, but suddenly there it was. For no reason at all. I thought - who knows what\u0027s inside there? What if it\u0027s the Minotaur? :-))) UGLI 666 Nutcracker, do you know any Latin? Nutscracker The Senate and People of Rome. P-Q-R-S. No, I\u0027m confusing it with the alphabet. What the Romans had was S-P-Q-R. Monstradamus Why are you interested in Latin, Ugly? UGLI 666 To translate a few words. Monstradamus I\u0027ll give it a try. UGLI 666 What\u0027s \u0027aiselceclesia\u0027? Monstradamus I don\u0027t know. UGLI 666 And \u0027ieselceaeclesi\u0027? Monstradamus I don\u0027t know that either. Are you sure it\u0027s Latin? UGLI 666 What else could it be? Monstradamus I can\u0027t tell yet. Can you give us the whole phrase? UGLI 666 It\u0027s very long. Monstradamus Then a couple of words at least. UGLI 666 It starts: \u0027aiselceclesia ieselceaeclesi selceataecles elceatctaecle\u0027. Monstradamus Stop, that\u0027s enough for now. UGLI 666 What is it? Monstradamus Not so fast. Let me have a think. Nutscracker Where\u0027s it from, Ugly? UGLI 666 From a labyrinth. Nutscracker Have you got a labyrinth outside your door? UGLI 666 What else am I supposed to have? Nutscracker Catacombs. Monstradamus Don\u0027t mock, Nutcracker. UGLI 666 The catacombs were the cradle of the faith. It would have been great reassurance from the Lord. Nutscracker She said before she had a hall full of benches. Now all of a sudden there\u0027s a labyrinth. UGLI 666 I wish you\u0027d go back to your bitches, Nutcracker, I really do. Can you make anything of it, Monstradamus? Monstradamus Were the words written in a column, one under the other? UGLI 666 Yes. Monstradamus Can you type the one that was in the middle? UGLI 666 What do you mean? Which one\u0027s that? Monstradamus The seventh from the top, if that makes it easier. UGLI 666 Eatcnasanctae. Nutscracker Eat NASA. I can\u0027t make out any other references there. Monstradamus Where did you find it? UGLI 666 I don\u0027t really want to talk about that. Monstradamus What if I reproduce the entire inscription, then will you tell me? UGLI 666 In that case, yes. Monstradamus The inscription was this: A I S E L C E C L E S I A I S E L C E A E C L E S I S E L C E A T A E C L E S E L C E A T C T A E C L E L C E A T C N C T A E C L C E A T C E A N C T A E C E A T C N A S A N C T A E C E A T C N A N C T A E C L C E A T C N C T A E C L E L C E A T C T A E C L E S E L C E A T A E C L E S I S E L C E A E C L E S I A I S E L C E C L E S I A UGLI 666 That\u0027s right. How did you do that? Monstradamus Dominus illuminatio mea. UGLI 666 But what does it mean? Monstradamus The Lord is my light. UGLI 666 I mean what does my inscription mean? Monstradamus Well, what do you think? UGLI 666 I can\u0027t make any sense of it at all. What sense is there? Monstradamus The sense can be very different, depending on where you found it. So you\u0027ll have to be honest about everything. UGLI 666 All right. Outside my door there really is a hall with benches. I didn\u0027t really look at it properly at first. But then when I did ... I\u0027m not even sure whether you\u0027ll believe me or not, Monstradamus. Monstradamus I\u0027ll give it a try. UGLI 666 There\u0027s a cathedral there. A Gothic cathedral. Nutscracker You just said there was a labyrinth. UGLI 666 That\u0027s there too, only inside the cathedral. And in front of the entrance to the labyrinth there\u0027s another Latin inscription laid out on the floor: HVNC MVNDVM TIPICE LABERINTHVS DENOTAT ISTE: INTRANTI LARGVS, REDEVNTI SED NIMIS ARTVS SIC MVNDO CAPTVS, VICIORVM MOLLE GRAVATVS VIX VALET AD VITE DOCTRINAM QVISQVE REDIRE. Monstradamus The meaning of that is more or less as follows - \u0027the labyrinth represents the world in which we live, wide at the entrance, but narrow at the exit. He who is ensnared by the joys of this world and is burdened with its sins, may only rediscover the doctrine of life through effort.\u0027 Only don\u0027t ask me what the doctrine of life is. Was there really a wide entrance and a narrow exit? UGLI 666 There wasn\u0027t any entrance or exit at all in the usual sense. The entire labyrinth was laid out on the floor of the cathedral in light-blue marble. It\u0027s just a mosaic. Nutscracker Is there such a thing as light-blue marble?

By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
