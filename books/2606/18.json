No! Nutscracker What? What? No I don\u0027t want that either. Nobody does. But why? Why? UGLI 666 Stay calm. Romeo-y-Cohiba Don\u0027t panic. Organizm(-: Stay calm ... Monstradamus Please, no! UGLI 666 Just relax. You\u0027re our head, and that goes through first. Monstradamus: Wha-a-a! Wha-a-a! Wha-a-a! IsoldA: Wha-a-a! Wha-a-a! Wha-a-a! Nutscracker: Wha-a-a! Wha-a-a! Wha-a-a!

Ariadne Hi, little brother. My, but you\u0027re ugly. Organizm(-: So what, now we\u0027ll be the Minosaur. The ancient serpent. UGLI 666 We always were, heh-heh. That human stuff was nothing but a nuisance. And all that bovine stuff too. Organizm(-: We\u0027ll be a dragon. We\u0027ll fly up to the clouds and dive down to the bottom of the sea. Maybe now things really will be easier. Monstradamus Easier? But we\u0027ve got Sartrik stuck right in the middle of us. Now we\u0027ll feel like puking all the time. Constantly. No matter how deep we dive, no matter who we pretend to be. Even Lolita, even a Rolls-Royce. Romeo-y-Cohiba But what if Sartrik hits the drink so hard that he slips the hook too? Nutscracker Let\u0027s not have any gloom and doom. The helmet isn\u0027t coming off. Organizm(-: But Theseus took it off. Nutscracker Maybe he never even put it on. Otherwise where could he have got to? There\u0027s no way out of there. There\u0027s nothing but jeeps, surf and sunshine. And horror, of course. And I\u0027m not just guessing, I\u0027m speaking as a professional. IsoldA But where is he now? Nutscracker What does it matter to us? There\u0027s no stopping him now. Monstradamus: I feel sick, xxx. IsoldA: I feel sick, xxx. Nutscracker: I feel sick, xxx. Organizm(-: I feel sick, xxx. Sartrik: I feel sick, xxx. Ariadne: I feel sick, xxx. It\u0027s time to get out of here ... UGLI 666: I feel sick, xxx. Romeo-y-Cohiba: I feel sick, xxx. Sartrik And my stomach\u0027s rumbling, xxx. Listen, Monstradamus. There\u0027s one thing I still don\u0027t get. Where did all this happen? Monstradamus Are you really that stupid or can you just not sober up? In the helmet of horror. Sartriks Oh. And who to? Monstradamus You.

By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
