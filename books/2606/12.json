The moment I took a couple of steps towards the jeep, its window began slowly winding down. Some kind of mechanism must have switched on. I really wanted to find out what was behind the glass, but the light began to fade, and a few seconds later it was dark. Exactly the same thing as happened to you, in fact. I climbed up on the platform and touched the wall where the window of the jeep had been. There was a gap there now. I ran my hand round its edge. It really felt like a car window. But the window hadn\u0027t opened all the way and the gap wasn\u0027t big enough to climb through the wall. There was a slight draught from the window, as if there was an air-conditioner working inside. And I thought I caught a faint glimpse of light. I leaned down to look inside, but as soon as my face was level with the opening something bumped against my cheek and I heard a terrible howl. I leapt back, lost my balance and fell off the platform on to the floor. The light came on - dim at first, then brighter and brighter, like in the cinema after a film. By the time it got really light, the jeep\u0027s window was already closed again. I went back out through the corridor into the open air and came back here. I was shaking all over at first, but I started feeling better on the way. It\u0027s funny to think about it now.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Well, I\u0027ve learned one lesson. Nice and easy does it.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Yes. Especially in your RR SUV.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n It\u0027s your RR SUV.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n It\u0027s on your side!\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n But you\u0027re the one inside it. That means it\u0027s yours.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n How can it be mine if I can\u0027t see it?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n And how can it be mine if I can\u0027t even get into it? Apart from sticking my head in the window.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Let\u0027s say it\u0027s ours then. Then we can\u0027t be wrong.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Agreed.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Isolde ... I want to tell you something. It will probably sound stupid, but I want you to hear it anyway. Whatever I\u0027m thinking about, I always come back to you. As if all the thoughts that aren\u0027t connected with you are heavy weights and as soon as my mind tries to deal with them, the effort becomes too much. But everything to do with you is light and happy, like the bubbles in champagne. I just want to go on and on thinking about it.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Yes, Romeo, that really did sound stupid. But I could say the same thing to you.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Why don\u0027t we meet again at the same place? Say tomorrow afternoon? Calmly, without any fuss. Or any noise.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n But what if we\u0027re being followed? I mean there, inside.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n The light goes out when the window opens.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Haven\u0027t you ever heard of infra-red cameras? They could do more than just watch us. They could shoot an entire movie.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Then who would they show it to?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Your wife, for instance. Or Ariadne in a dream.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I haven\u0027t got a wife. And I couldn\u0027t give a damn for Ariadne and her dreams. If we start worrying about spies, pretty soon the world will be full of them.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n You\u0027re right. The only way to be alone is to behave as though we are already alone.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n So it\u0027s a date then?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Tomorrow at three, Romeo. I date your car.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Our car. My green-eyed Lolita. My lovely Mona Lita.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n And now to sleep, Cohiba. Be seeing you.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Be seeing you, be seeing you. Monster, are you there?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Yes. Where else could I be?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Well, what do you make of that?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n No doubt our master shed a great big sentimental tear. The twilight of Ancient Greek thought in a nutshell. Zeno\u0027s paradoxes. Achilles can\u0027t go riding in his big beautiful car. Because when he\u0027s riding in it, he can\u0027t see it. The passers-by can see it, so they\u0027re the ones riding in it. And Achilles only imagines he\u0027s driving it, but in actual fact it\u0027s driving him.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I feel a bit jealous. How about you?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Not particularly. I don\u0027t like jeeps. You\u0027re too high above the road when you sit in them. And anyway an RR SUV is a bit OTT. Cohiba ought to have an Alfa Romeo.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I don\u0027t mean the car. Alfa Romeo, Beta Romeo - all that sounds like the stud ranking in a herd of chimpanzees to me. I mean the feelings.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n But you have them too. They have love, you have envy. As comrade Ariadne teaches us, these are merely different states assumed by past within the helmet of horror.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And on that optimistic note ...\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Yes indeed. Good night.\\n\\n :-))))\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Who wants to chat?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n I do.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And I do.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n And I do I suppose.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n An interesting team. Monstradamus, Ariadne, me and Nutcracker. Has anyone noticed that the four of us have something in common?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n It would be hard not to notice. We all use toilet paper with a little star on it.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n And we share a great passion for life.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n That\u0027s not all, though.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n We\u0027ve all been fed garbage just recently as well. Did everyone get that putrid lasagne yesterday? And how did you like today\u0027s vegetarian beefsteak, rare and bloody?\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n That\u0027s not it either.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n I know what he means. None of us has said anything about our labyrinths.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Really? It\u0027s just that no one\u0027s asked me.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And are you willing to tell us?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Of course.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n So what have you got outside your door?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n A bedroom.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n What, just an ordinary bedroom?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n No, not ordinary. If you ever leaf through those fashionable journals with all the chic interiors, you might have seen something of the kind. It\u0027s a large room, and the bed takes up at least half of it. The mattress is so wonderful I don\u0027t even know how to describe it. I should write more poems. When you lie down on it, it feels like you\u0027re parachuting through the air, soaring along the pillows, the blankets and the sheets - everything is absolutely the very best. And there\u0027s an air conditioner with heaps of different operating modes. You can set it so that a fresh breeze blows through the room as though it\u0027s coming straight off the sea. And there are thick curtains on the window that ...\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n You\u0027ve got a window? What does it look out on?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s some kind of garden, and the branches of trees. I can\u0027t see anything else.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Have you tried opening it?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n The window doesn\u0027t open. What else now? There\u0027s a really elegant wall-lamp above the bed and a night-lamp in the corner. There\u0027s a mini-bar too, only there aren\u0027t any drinks in it, nothing but little boxes of sleeping pills. There are lots and lots of them, all beautiful kinds of colours, and inside each one there are instructions on how many pills you can take at once, which ones you can take with others, which ones you can\u0027t, and so on. Only I don\u0027t need any sleeping pills. I only have to lie down on the bed, and I\u0027m gone. I just fly away.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And is that all there is?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n When I leave the bedroom for a long time - say an hour or more - someone changes the sheets and makes the bed. But I haven\u0027t met anyone, not even once. And there aren\u0027t any other doors in the bedroom, there\u0027s only one way in.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n How do you explain that?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n I don\u0027t try. It\u0027s less scary that way.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n A labyrinth like that could give you bedsores, Ariadne.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n You weren\u0027t listening to what I said, Nutcracker. The mattress I have is so wonderful I can\u0027t even feel it. What bedsores? An angel could sleep on it without even creasing its wings.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n That\u0027s an interesting subject. How angels sleep.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Probably like bats, on a coral perch. And they have special gold hooks on their slippers.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Perhaps. Only they hang head-up, because they aren\u0027t attracted by the earth\u0027s gravity, only by the love of the Lord. Like Ugly said. Angels are non-material beings.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Then how did they manage to choose wives for themselves from among the daughters of man and beget children?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Ugly probably knows about that. Or she can check with some of her friends. Ugly, are you there?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n By the way, on the subject of checking with your friends. Ariadne, you said we could ask you questions about the helmet of horror in case you have another dream about our management.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Of course.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n I have three. Firstly, I really would like to know how everything else can be manufactured out of nothing. And secondly, how the helmet of horror can be located inside one of its own parts, and does that mean that inside one helmet there is a second one, and inside the second a third one, and so on to infinity in both directions? And the final question is - exactly how does the separator labyrinth work?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n All right, I\u0027ll ask.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And at the same time ask them to say something about the occipital braid. So far we don\u0027t know a single thing about it.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n I have a question - why is the helmet of horror called that? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-12.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
