You\u0027re nothing but shackles on the convolutions of my brain. All your Rolls-Royces and Lolitas, Ferraris and Berlusconis, all your shaved and scented glamour, your magic wonderland TV quizzes, where you get shafted up the xxx every day underneath the money tree - you made it all out of my head! You do all that out of my head, and I\u0027m nothing to you, but you\u0027re the entire deal for me, eh? In my xxx head! But I\u0027ll dump you all. Nutscracker Monster, maybe you understood some of that? Monstradamus I might have. But I\u0027m not a hundred per cent certain. Nutscracker Translate from the Latin, will you? Monstradamus There\u0027s quite a profound thought here. He\u0027s trying to say the helmet of horror is the contents of the mind, which attempt to supplant the mind by proving that they - the contents - exist, and the mind in which they arise doesn\u0027t. Or that the mind is no more than its function. Nutscracker Who are they trying to prove it to? Monstradamus Themselves. Certainly not the mind. The mind, as Sartrik puts it, couldn\u0027t give a xxx. Nutscracker And where are they trying to prove it? Monstradamus What d\u0027you mean, where? In the mind. Where else? Nutscracker This climb\u0027s a bit too high without a bottle. For me at least. Sartrik Listen, Monstradamus, you\u0027re some guy! The way you put that! I even understood it myself. Some mess, eh? If you think that thought through all the way to the end, all those English astrophysicists and the entire xxx Academy of Sciences should be thrown in the slammer! Monstradamus Why bother putting them away? Who cares about those buffoons. Sartrik Oho! You\u0027re a hard case, aren\u0027t you? Theseus, you\u0027re Theseus, no two ways about it. Nutscracker You\u0027re a real Theseus too, Sartrik. Maybe you\u0027ve even found the way out? Sartrik A long time ago. Only there are these snakes crawling around in front of it. But when they crawl away I\u0027ll leave. :-(( )) Monstradamus Ariadne! Good morning? Ariadne Good morning. Monstradamus Did you see the dwarf? Ariadne Yes. Monstradamus Tell me about it. Ariadne I was in the building on the square in front of the fountain. You remember, I told you about it. It looked dark and oppressive, as though there was a fire there a long time ago and afterwards they tried several times to fix it up, but they hadn\u0027t been able to. It was the same inside. It felt like a camouflaged smouldering ruin. I can\u0027t even say what it was that gave me the feeling. Everything was new, expensive and chic - like in those glass palaces they rent out for offices. The air was cool and clean, there wasn\u0027t the slightest smell of burning in it at all. But somehow I felt if you took the oak panels off the walls you\u0027d see all the stonework was blackened with smoke. Monstradamus How did you know it was the same building? Ariadne I went across to the window and looked out. Down below me was the fountain with the snakes where I saw Asterisk for the first time. There was a wide street with palms standing in tubs leading away from the fountain. The street ran out to the very edge of the city and ended at a huge triumphal arch strewn with yellow leaves. Standing on the ground in front of the arch was a bronze head that must have been the size of a truck. There was a stepladder leaning against its ear, and it had a gold star on its forehead with an inscription: \u0027The Tomb of the Unknown Helmholtz\u0027. Nutscracker How could you see all that through the window? Ariadne I just looked in that direction. Nutscracker And you could read the words at that distance? Ariadne What distances are there in a dream? There aren\u0027t any except the ones you dream about. I dreamed there was that inscription on the monument\u0027s forehead. I didn\u0027t dream about any distances. Monstradamus That\u0027s clear enough. What else did you see? Ariadne The further away from the main street, the fewer houses there were. The city boundary was a circular wall, and outside that there was a desert in various tones of beige. Further away still there were dark-blue mountains, or perhaps they were clouds in the sunset. I didn\u0027t have time to look at anything else, because then one of the dwarves appeared in the corridor. He was in a hurry to get somewhere and looking quite aggressive - his loose robe was caught in with a belt that had a little sabre dangling on it. He didn\u0027t stop, just gestured for me to follow him. We began climbing the stairs. I asked him a question, but he told me to keep quiet. He said his master was under threat - they wanted to kill him. And so all questions and answers were now being strictly documented. I asked who wanted to kill his master, but he muttered that the reply to that question had to be documented as well. We came to a large open area with identical shelves of files on all the walls - it looked like some kind of archive. There was a kind of double round table in the centre - about fifty centimetres above the table-top there was a smaller disc of wood that could rotate. They used to have something of the sort in old canteens so that people could move any dish within reach by turning the upper disc. The dwarf sat down at the table and pointed to the place opposite him. I sat down. On the table in front of me there was an inkwell with a genuine goose-quill pen and a file containing sheets of paper. The dwarf had an identical inkwell and file. He told me to write down my question and put the sheet of paper on the wooden disc. I wrote: \u0027Who wants to kill the Minotaur?\u0027 The quill actually wrote very easily, with a fine line. Meanwhile the dwarf took a sheet of paper out of his file and wrote something himself. We put the sheets of paper on the rotating wooden disc, the dwarf turned it through a hundred and eighty degrees, then he had my question in front of him and I had his answer. It was brief: \u0027You already know\u0027. And it was written on paper headed with a crest. Apparently he didn\u0027t even need to read my question, he already knew it. Nutscracker Paper headed with a crest? What was the crest like? Ariadne A little star framed in laurel leaves. It looked very impressive, you could even feel it with your fingers. Embossing. There was a motto under the crest: \u0027per aspera ad asterisk\u0027. And there were watermarks in the paper. And as well as all that, there was a three-figure number in the upper right corner of the page - the blank sheets were numbered. Monstradamus, I wanted to ask you, what do those words mean? Monstradamus There is an expression \u0027per aspera ad astra\u0027, meaning \u0027through difficulties to the stars\u0027. And so this version means ... Organizm(-: Through xxx to the xxx. Monstradamus Well, that\u0027s not exactly a poetic translation. What came next, Ariadne? Ariadne Next I wrote a question and he wrote an answer. Why don\u0027t I type them all out together from the sheets of paper? Monstradamus What do you mean, \u0027type them out\u0027? Have you got the sheets there? Ariadne Yes. Monstradamus How did you get hold of them? Ariadne I don\u0027t know. When I woke up they were lying beside the bed. Perhaps the people who tidy up the room brought them. Monstradamus And you didn\u0027t notice anything? Nutscracker Monster, you\u0027re like a man who\u0027s turned into a bull and is amazed to find he has a bell on his tail. Monstradamus Is that bit about the bull some kind of a hint? Ariadne Let me answer your questions and get something to eat, okay? Then you can talk among yourselves. Monstradamus Of course, Ariadne. Ariadne I\u0027ve already told you about the first question. Let\u0027s move on Question: \u0027How can everything else be manufactured out of nothing?\u0027 Answer: \u0027See the answer to the next question.\u0027 Next question: \u0027How can the helmet of horror be located inside one of its own parts?\u0027 Answer: \u0027The helmet of horror fractionates the one thing that is, into the multitude of things that are not. But since the helmet of horror is in no way the one thing that is, it is also one of the multitude of things that are not. And the things that are not may enter into every possible conceivable and inconceivable kind of relationship, since these relationships do not in any case exist anywhere except in the helmet of horror, which does not actually exist itself.\u0027 Question: \u0027Does this mean that inside the helmet there is another helmet and in the other helmet there is a third one and so on to infinity in both directions?\u0027 Answer: \u0027An individual by the name of A may be a part of the helmet of horror worn by B, and an individual by the name of B may at the same time be a part of the helmet of horror worn by A. This is the final infinity in both directions, and often both of them are quite nice people.\u0027 Question: \u0027Can you please say something about the occipital braid.\u0027 Answer: \u0027Longer and thicker suits the girl better.\u0027 Nutscracker All very logical. Ariadne Question: \u0027How does the separator labyrinth work?\u0027 Just look what happened then! The dwarf had his answer scribbled out even before I had finished writing my question. He waited for me, then tossed his page on to the upper table-top and began turning it. But halfway round he suddenly stopped it and asked in a considerate voice: \u0027Are you enjoying your stay as our guest? Be honest.\u0027 I told him: \u0027Not much. In fact, to be quite honest, I\u0027m not enjoying it at all.\u0027 Then he let the wooden disc carry on turning and I received a sheet of paper with the answer: \u0027That\u0027s the way it works\u0027. Organizm(-: I get it. Good, bad and UGLI. But did you ask him why the helmet of horror is called that? I asked you to, remember? Ariadne I remember. It was the last question I managed to ask. Organizm(-: Well then? Ariadne The dwarf asked me to excuse him. He said he\u0027d run out of official paper. But he promised to answer shortly. Nutscracker What happened then? Ariadne We heard some kind of horn or trumpet sounding a low, sinister note. Or it could have been some animal bellowing. The dwarf was so startled he dropped his inkwell on the floor and it broke, making a blue puddle beside the table. He said his master was summoning him to help and he ran off. And as he left he shouted it was possible that blood would soon be spilled, but it would be avenged. Nutscracker Blood? Ariadne Yes. Romeo-y-Cohiba Are you lot finished yet? When do you think the rest of us could have a chat? Nutscracker Nobody\u0027s stopping you, Romeo. Romeo-y-Cohiba Isolde, are you there? IsoldA Yes. How did you get home yesterday, you beast? Romeo-y-Cohiba Why beast? IsoldA What am I supposed to call you after that? Romeo-y-Cohiba After what? IsoldA After the way you behaved. Romeo-y-Cohiba Me? Me? And just how did I behave? IsoldA","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-15.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
