Gluttony is not so very terrible in itself. But it\u0027s a sign of a base soul. The same thing applies to debauchery. The soul doesn\u0027t become debased through committing these acts. A base soul manifests itself through them.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n No, you won\u0027t get under his skin that easily.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Moderators! Give us all something to eat!\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n I heard some kind of noise. But where\u0027s the food?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n There\u0027s a small flap to the right of the monitor. Just a rectangle in the wall. Lift the flap and you\u0027ll find a tray behind it.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n I found it, thank you.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n But what are you supposed to turn? Organism said ...\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n He was just joking, Romeo. Having a laugh.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Let\u0027s all eat in peace. Bon appetit .\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n I\u0027m back. Who\u0027s there?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I am. Is everything all right?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Yes.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I was worried.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n I was only gone for a moment. Where\u0027s everyone else?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n They\u0027re eating. There\u0027s just the two of us.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n What\u0027s outside your door?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n A labyrinth of neatly trimmed rough bushes higher than my head. And running between the bushes is a dirt pathway.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n And I\u0027ve got the same kind of bushes along the sides of an alley.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n An alley?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n My door opens into a park. The alley starts right outside and along the sides there are bushes. With treetops showing above them in places.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What I\u0027ve got is more like a corridor between the bushes, I wouldn\u0027t call it an alley. And it starts winding straightaway, so I can\u0027t see anything but leaves. It\u0027s more like a narrow corridor than anything else, neatly sliced through the bushes by something like a combine harvester.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n What colour is the ground there?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Beige.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n It\u0027s beige here too. We\u0027re near each other!\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What else did you see?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n I didn\u0027t go very far. There are lots of alleys, and they keep branching and twisting and turning corners. I wasn\u0027t afraid in the least. Quite the opposite, what I saw gave me a really good feeling. The labyrinth might be complex, but it\u0027s impossible to get lost in.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Because there\u0027s a plan hanging at every place the path branches. And there\u0027s a little sign on the plan: \u0027You are here\u0027.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n That\u0027s handy all right. And wasn\u0027t there any little sign saying: \u0027The Minotaur is here\u0027?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n No.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I was joking. Did you meet anyone?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n No. But several times I had the feeling there was someone just round the corner.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n And was there anything like what Ariadne was talking about?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Yes, kind of. Only not exactly. Once I spotted some roofs above the bushes, but they were a long way off. And I saw fountains with different kinds of figures.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Like the one Ariadne talked about?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. I went through a few forks in the path and at every one there was a small ... I don\u0027t know what to call it - an oasis, I suppose. Trees and a fountain with bronze figures of animals. First a hare and a tortoise. They were sitting facing each other, with their faces lifted up to the sky. Their mouths were open and there were long thin streams of water spurting out. To be quite honest, it looked a bit ridiculous, as though they were spitting at an invisible ceiling that was too high, so that everything just fell back down on their own heads. At another fork there was a fountain with a fox and a crow. The crow was high up in the tree, and so big it looked more like an eagle. There was a water pipe leading up to it, hidden among the leaves. The fox was squatting on his haunches gazing up at the crow as though it was trying to hit it with the stream of water spurting out of its throat, but it couldn\u0027t reach high enough. The crow had its wings pulled back and up and its beak was open, and there was another stream of water spurting out of that, as though the sight of the fox made it feel sick.\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Now that\u0027s something I can understand.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n What do you understand?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Take no notice. You\u0027re a wonderful storyteller, Isolde. It was like seeing it all with my own eyes.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Yes, I forgot to say. The plan that was hanging everywhere looked more like an old engraving than something modern. Or like an enlarged photocopy of an engraving. And written on it in this strange oblique typeface was: plan du labirinthe de versailles . What could that mean? Is it from the word \u0027verse\u0027? Because there are characters from fables in the fountains?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n A plan of the labyrinth at Versailles. That\u0027s a real piece of luck.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Versailles? Then why is it written with a small letter?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n I could suggest that\u0027s not really the strangest thing about our surroundings.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Do you mind not butting into other people\u0027s conversations?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Sorry, I didn\u0027t realise it was private.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n And where did you go, Romeo?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I haven\u0027t been outside yet.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Why not?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I think it\u0027s some kind of trap.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n I think it\u0027s a trap, too. But we\u0027re already caught in it anyway. And the room you\u0027re sitting in is just as much a part of it as what\u0027s outside the door.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n That\u0027s true. I suppose I ought to go out and scout around. Maybe I could find the way to your fountains.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Wait, Romeo. It\u0027s dark out there already. You can go tomorrow. Why don\u0027t you tell me what you look like instead? Are you like what Ariadne said?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I don\u0027t understand why everyone\u0027s decided I was the man she dreamed about. The only things we have in common are the tattoo and the moustache. We\u0027ve already dealt with the tattoo. That just leaves the moustache. And that\u0027s like identifying a man by the colour of his tie.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Are you really bald?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Not bald, my head\u0027s shaved. That\u0027s a big difference. People go bald because they have no choice, but they shave their heads out of self-respect. Even if it does look the same from a distance. And my mole is really small, you can hardly see it. And anyway, who doesn\u0027t have some kind of a mole on his face?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Are you handsome?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What does \u0027handsome\u0027 mean?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Well, it means a man is nice to look at.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Nice for who? I got used to the way I look ages ago. And as far as anyone else is concerned, it depends on the circumstances. But one thing I can say for certain is you needn\u0027t be afraid of being with me.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n What do you mean? Do you mean I wouldn\u0027t be frightened of you? Or do you mean that with you I wouldn\u0027t have to be afraid of anything?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n He\u0027s trying to say that if you\u0027re with him even he won\u0027t frighten you.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Just give people a chance to talk, will you? Isolde, can I ask you something about yourself?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Such as?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Such as ... Do you like poetry?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Sometimes.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Who\u0027s your favourite poet?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Caroline Kennedy.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What has she written?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n \u0027The Favourite Poems of Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis.\u0027\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n And what do you look like?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n How would you like me to look?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I\u0027d like to know how you really look.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Medium height. Dark hair. Green eyes. They say I\u0027m beautiful.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n But can you describe yourself so I can imagine how you look? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-5.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
