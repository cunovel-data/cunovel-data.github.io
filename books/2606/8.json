{"id":98148,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"And you mean the Helmholtz won\u0027t notice anything?\n Nutscracker\n Used on its own, any one of the techniques used is easy enough to spot. But if the methods are combined together in a subtle fashion and always applied in rotation at a level of intensity just on the border line of perception, you get practically a hundred per cent precise manipulation combined with total imperceptibility.\n Organizm(-:\n I get it. It\u0027s like what you see at the railway stations in Asia. When a passenger thinks it\u0027s the tumbler-gambler who\u0027s going to cheat him but actually everyone playing the game is in on the swindle even though they\u0027re arguing with each other all the time, maybe even fighting.\n Nutscracker\n Exactly. Only in our case absolutely everybody in the station is in on it, including the stone Atlantes by the main entrance.\n Ariadne\n How clever you are, Nutcracker. After I listened to you I wrote a poem. It\u0027s dedicated to you, Romeo and Isolde. Shall I read it?\n Nutscracker\n Go on.\n Ariadne\n Beyond the window-pane on Doom and Gloom\n Old Pavlov\u0027s Bitch\u0027s Sticky Glance is glued.\n My Minotaur! Creep silently into my room\n Beckon me with a glance, brazenly nude.\n Nutscracker\n Powerful as ever. And he\u0027s already partly fulfilled your wish by removing his helmet, even though he has no head underneath it. I\u0027d say it\u0027s impossible to expose yourself any more brazenly than that.\n UGLI 666\n Nutcracker, there\u0027s one thing about what you say I can\u0027t understand. How can you change what\u0027s in front of a person\u0027s eyes without him noticing? If he\u0027s looking at the same place but sees something different, how can he fail to notice?\n Nutscracker\n I couldn\u0027t understand that at first either. But for the Helmholtz the word \u0027change\u0027 has no meaning. In real life what you see depends on where you look. But when you\u0027re wearing a helmet, it\u0027s the other way round - where you\u0027re looking depends on what you see. Is that clear?\n UGLI 666\n Not entirely.\n Nutscracker\n In the real world you see what\u0027s in front of your eyes. No matter which way you point your rump. But in this world you see what\u0027s in front of your eyes, no matter which way you point your head. As we used to say in the xxx, it\u0027s chalk and cheese, even though it sounds pretty much the same. You don\u0027t have any independent system of coordinates, and we decide everything you see. So you can\u0027t even suspect anything. For you even the world isn\u0027t what it really is, but what\u0027s shown to you. You feel like you\u0027re looking around in a natural manner, but in fact all the time your eyes keep stumbling over our candidate - sorry, I mean our vase - and it gives you this light and happy feeling. But you never think to ask why, the same way no one ever asks why it\u0027s a sunny day.\n Organizm(-:\n An interesting slip of the tongue.\n Nutscracker\n And if the mark turns his head too rapidly, so that \u0027Sticky Eye\u0027 and \u0027Sunny Kiss\u0027 stop working, then \u0027Doom and Gloom\u0027 and \u0027The Weight\u0027 kick in immediately.\n Organizm(-:\n Well, Nutcracker, so now I understand what you do for a living. Tell me, as a professional, do you reckon they could be influencing us in some similar kind of way in here?\n Nutscracker\n I\u0027d have to think about that.\n UGLI 666\n I noticed a long time ago that conspiracy theory has taken the place of religion for atheists. They always think there\u0027s someone manipulating them, hypnotising them, zombifying them, bugging them, trailing them. But that someone is simply the devil, and that\u0027s all. The fact is, it\u0027s only a short step from atheism to schizophrenia, and in most cases it\u0027s already been taken. What about you, Organism? Do you feel like someone\u0027s manipulating you?\n Organizm(-:\n To be honest, I do.\n UGLI 666\n What kind of manipulation is it?\n Organizm(-:\n Being locked in here, for instance. Or being fed pancakes for the second day running.\n UGLI 666\n Ah, in that sense. But that\u0027s not manipulation, that\u0027s God\u0027s punishment.\n Organizm(-:\n Ugly, let me explain to you how we\u0027re manipulated in here. Let\u0027s assume that headgear on Asterisk\u0027s head is a virtual reality helmet after all.\n UGLI 666\n And then what?\n Organizm(-:\n Perhaps everything we see here is something like that flat area Nutcracker was talking about - with the three identical vases, except one of them is more identical than the others.\n Nutscracker\n For us to be manipulated like that, we\u0027d have to be wearing helmets.\n Organizm(-:\n Maybe we are.\n Nutscracker\n Touch your face with your hands. Can you feel any helmet?\n Organism(-:\n No, but ...\n Monstradamus\n I know what he\u0027s going to ask now. He\u0027s going to ask whether you can use a helmet to simulate what you feel with your hands.\n Organizm(-:\n Well that\u0027s right. It seems a natural enough question to me.\n Nutscracker\n If everything is simulated by the helmet, then it\u0027s not a helmet or a simulation any more. It\u0027s life.\n Organizm(-:\n Nutcracker, there\u0027s one thing you didn\u0027t explain. Who switches on all these \u0027Sticky Eyes\u0027 and \u0027Sunny Kisses\u0027? Surely someone has to control it all?\n Nutscracker\n Certainly. There\u0027s an operator with a special monitor. He sees the Helmholtz as a dot on a radar screen. And the vases would be, say, red rhomboids. There\u0027s a manipulation menu on the same screen. The rest is all just like in Windows - click and drag.\n Monstradamus\n Click and drag. A great slogan for a double-edged axe.\n Organizm(-:\n And how can you do it the other way round?\n Nutscracker\n How do you mean?\n Organizm(-:\n So the virtual reality helmet is on the operator who controls the manipulation. And this operator somehow makes the others see what he sees.\n Nutscracker\n How could he make them do that?\n Organizm(-:\n Hypnosis.\n UGLI 666\n There you are. I was just waiting for that word.\n Nutscracker\n I don\u0027t know much about hypnosis. But if a hypnotist was powerful enough to make others see what he sees, why would he need a helmet?\n Organizm(-:\n In order to know what the others have to see.\n Monstradamus\n You could take it even further. Not just seeing, but actually being there. Asterisk wears a helmet in which he sees a labyrinth. And we\u0027re all inside this labyrinth. And he manipulates us.\n Nutscracker\n You mean we\u0027re all inside the Minotaur\u0027s head?\n Monstradamus\n You could say we\u0027re in the space that he sees.\n Nutscracker\n Then where\u0027s the Minotaur?\n Monstradamus\n We have to assume he\u0027s in the space that Ariadne sees in her dreams.\n Organizm(-:\n End of the line. Remember, Nutcracker, at the very beginning you asked me \u0027Where is here exactly?\u0027 I didn\u0027t understand your question at first. In the helmet of horror, that\u0027s where.\n Nutscracker\n That doesn\u0027t fit, though. On the one hand, the Minotaur\u0027s manipulating all of us, but on the other hand, he\u0027s got no head ... But then again, quite apart from this particular case, I can testify professionally that\u0027s what causes all the problems.\n Organizm(-:\n Absolutely. This Asterisk has a cheap kettle with a solar battery in his helmet. How can he decide where to use \u0027Sunny Kiss\u0027 and where to use \u0027The Seventh Seal\u0027?\n Monstradamus\n Automatically. It might all depend on which section of the helmet of horror a bubble of hope happens to burst in.\n Organizm(-:\n But I\u0027m the one who sees the ray of sunlight or the dove, not Asterisk. I don\u0027t understand anything any more. Who\u0027s wearing the helmet of horror? Me or the Minotaur?\n Nutscracker\n The Helmholtz.\n Monstradamus\n We\u0027ve been talking about that helmet too long already. It feels like we keep trying it on over and over again. It will attach itself permanently to our heads soon. Let\u0027s change the subject.\n Organizm(-:\n Great idea, let\u0027s. I\u0027ve just had a thought. Has anyone ever wondered why Star Wars has such a strange sequel - instead of filming what came after the third episode, they filmed what came before the first one?\n Monstradamus\n Why?\n Organizm(-:\n At the end of the third episode Darth Vader dies, and that\u0027s the end of all the Star Wars. There can\u0027t be any more, because he\u0027s the Minotaur of that world, and that black heap of junk on his head is the helmet of horror. He thinks every one of them: Luke Skywalker, the robots, Chewbacca and all the rest of it. So after he\u0027s killed there can\u0027t be any continuation.\n Monstradamus\n But Darth Vader takes his helmet off before he dies. And underneath he has a normal head, only covered in scars.\n Organizm(-:\n Yes, but it\u0027s just a fantasy, after all.\n Nutscracker\n Yes, Organism. Very profound. And the Iron Mask was another Minotaur. When they handed him over to the Marquis de Sade to be corrupted, the revolution began, because the pain in his xxx made him stop thinking up royalist France.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Isolde, are you here?\n IsoldA\n Yes.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I\u0027m back. What\u0027s happening here?\n IsoldA\n Nothing very interesting. Nutcracker was telling everybody about politics. And I only got back from Versailles just recently.\n Monstradamus\n Nutcracker, on that business of royalist France. You know, the Marquis turned out not to be so terrible after all.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n It\u0027s all very monotonous where I am. Bushes, a bend, bushes, a fork, a bend, on and on for ever. The passage is about six feet wide.\n IsoldA\n What\u0027s that in metres?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Two. Makes you feel like a rat in a maze. At one point I decided I\u0027d had enough and tried to climb through the hedge. Some chance. There\u0027s a barbed-wire mesh fence in the bushes - like the grid of bars in reinforced concrete. And I\u0027d been wondering how they managed to keep the bushes so even!\n IsoldA\n That labyrinth must lead out into my park. You just didn\u0027t go far enough. We have the same ground under our feet. Beige soil.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I kept turning to the right. It\u0027s funny. A flashback from my childhood. You know the way it is - a memory illuminated by a warm, long-forgotten light that seems to conceal the most important answer of all. Some book of adventure stories you read God only knows how many years ago. Where it said you can get through any labyrinth if you keep turning right all the time. So I decided to try it. Seems it was right - I did find something interesting after all. I saw one of your fountains. It was a long way off, though.\n IsoldA\n Tell me about it, then.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n At one point in the labyrinth there\u0027s a little bench. A perfectly ordinary bench, like they have in parks. I climbed up on it and stood on the back, and my eyes were level with the upper edge of the bushes. On one side I could see a jet of water rising into the air, and on the other, way off in the distance, some kind of dark roof that looked as though it was covered with soot. The roof was hard to make out because it was so far away, and the jet of water was very strange - one jet shooting up into the air, but several of them falling down. Maybe it was an optical illusion.\n IsoldA\n No, that\u0027s right. I know that fountain. It has bronze figures too. There\u0027s a snake and a ... I\u0027ve forgotten what it\u0027s called, like a pig with long spines.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-8.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: \n Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
