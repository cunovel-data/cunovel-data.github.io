It\u0027s the mooderattors.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Step mucking us, you ratten scam!\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n There\u0027s no point in getting upset, Romeo. It won\u0027t help matters.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Have they really stopped?\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Good for you, Romeo! They did what you told them to.

Or who has to kill him. What do you have in mind, Monstradamus?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Maybe he\u0027s already here, but he doesn\u0027t want the moderator to notice him. And I suspect the moderator\u0027s our bronze mushroom.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n You talk about him as if you\u0027d seen him with your own eyes. But we don\u0027t actually have any reason to believe he exists.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Who do you mean? Theseus or Asterisk?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Both.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n And for exactly the same reason, Romeo, there\u0027s no reason to believe that you exist.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n That just about does it. Leave it out, will you?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Perhaps Theseus is one of us?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Perhaps the Minotaur\u0027s one of us.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n I bet a hundred xxx the Minotaur\u0027s Monstradamus.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Stop clowning about.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Theseus, answer us!\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n At least tell us if you\u0027re here or not!

When the door opens, a lever shaped like a leg with a hoof moves out and down.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n Lord save us and keep us!\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n To make the door close, you push the lever. To make it open, you press on the axe in the middle. So everyone can open their own door when they want to.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n It works.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n What can you see outside the door?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n There\u0027s another room outside mine.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n Semi-darkness.

By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
