Doesn\u0027t that seem a bit strange?\n Monstradamus\n That\u0027s richt.\n Nutscracker\n They cantroll our entire canvasation.\n IsoldA\n Are yew ploying the foul?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n No, I woodn\u0027t deram of it.\n Monstradamus\n Me kneether. It\u0027s the mooderattors.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Step mucking us, you ratten scam!\n UGLI 666\n There\u0027s no point in getting upset, Romeo. It won\u0027t help matters.\n IsoldA\n Have they really stopped?\n Organizm(-:\n Good for you, Romeo! They did what you told them to. Why not try telling our moderators to do something else?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Stick your xxx up your xxx and give it a double right twist.\n IsoldA\n They\u0027re following every word we write.\n Monstradamus\n Maybe that\u0027s why Theseus isn\u0027t saying anything?\n Organizm(-:\n What Theseus?\n Nutscracker\n The one who killed the Minotaur, Organism. Or who has to kill him. What do you have in mind, Monstradamus?\n Monstradamus\n Maybe he\u0027s already here, but he doesn\u0027t want the moderator to notice him. And I suspect the moderator\u0027s our bronze mushroom.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n You talk about him as if you\u0027d seen him with your own eyes. But we don\u0027t actually have any reason to believe he exists.\n Ariadne\n Who do you mean? Theseus or Asterisk?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Both.\n Monstradamus\n And for exactly the same reason, Romeo, there\u0027s no reason to believe that you exist.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n That just about does it. Leave it out, will you?\n Ariadne\n Perhaps Theseus is one of us?\n Nutscracker\n Perhaps the Minotaur\u0027s one of us.\n Organizm(-:\n I bet a hundred xxx the Minotaur\u0027s Monstradamus.\n Monstradamus\n Stop clowning about.\n Organizm(-:\n Theseus, answer us!\n IsoldA\n At least tell us if you\u0027re here or not! Theseus!\n Monstradamus\n By the way. If the moderators can fulfil our wishes, why don\u0027t we ask them to open the door?\n UGLI 666\n But what\u0027s outside the door?\n Organizm(-:\n We can find out.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n You be careful, or the door might really go ahead and open.\n Ariadne\n I\u0027ve composed a little poem. Dedicated to Monstradamus.\n Monstradamus\n Let\u0027s hear it.\n Ariadne\n The Minotaur lurks at the door,\n His axe it gleams moon-bright.\n \u0027Dear Watson this could not be more ...\u0027\n Then silence in the night.\n Monstradamus\n A bit on the dark side. But maybe I deserve it for being so suspicious.\n Organizm(-:\n An experiment. Doors, open!\n UGLI 666\n Lord have mercy!\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I warned you!\n Ariadne\n Did it happen in all the rooms?\n Monstradamus\n It did in mine.\n UGLI 666\n Do you mean the music or the door?\n Ariadne\n The whole thing at once.\n IsoldA\n I\u0027ve got sky outside. Grey. Looks a bit like a park. Everything seems quiet. I\u0027m going out to explore.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Hey, Isolde, wait! It could be dangerous out there!\n UGLI 666\n It\u0027s dark out there.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Isolde!\n Nutscracker\n Did everyone hear the trumpets?\n Ariadne\n Do you think they were trumpets?\n Organizm(-:\n Doors, close!\n Nutscracker\n xxx be praised.\n Monstradamus\n Organizm, don\u0027t go trying any more experiments like that.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Now how\u0027s Isolde going to get back? Doors, open!\n Nutscracker\n xxx, eh? Again!\n Monstradamus\n Let\u0027s just keep calm and get our bearings.\n Organizm(-:\n Okay, I think I\u0027ve got it. When the door opens, a lever shaped like a leg with a hoof moves out and down.\n UGLI 666\n Lord save us and keep us!\n Nutscracker\n To make the door close, you push the lever. To make it open, you press on the axe in the middle. So everyone can open their own door when they want to.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n It works.\n Monstradamus\n What can you see outside the door?\n Ariadne\n There\u0027s another room outside mine.\n UGLI 666\n Semi-darkness. Benches, a lot of benches.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Fresh air at last.\n Sartrik\n Two fridges full of booze. So there is a God after all!\n Organizm(-:\n Plywood walls painted to look like bricks. It all looks pretty naff.\n Nutscracker\n I\u0027ve got a load of electronic equipment.\n Organizm(-:\n I\u0027m hungry. Hey, you moderators, how\u0027s about a bit of nosh down here? Right ...

Now we\u0027re talking.\n Monstradamus\n What?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n What was it you turned, tell us.\n Organizm(-:\n They sent down some pancakes with jam. Not bad for Ancient Greece. I feel like a nice quiet meal, so I\u0027m taking a break now.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Enjoy your meal. Just tell us what it was you turned.\n Organizm(-:\n When I\u0027m feeding my tum, I go all deaf and dumb.\n Ariadne\n Organism, you only need to type two words!

By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
