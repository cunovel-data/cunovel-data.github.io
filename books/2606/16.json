IsoldA So you\u0027re embarrassed of them, but not of me! And you have the cheek to ask me how you behaved? All right, I\u0027ll tell you. Like a coarse brute, that\u0027s how. Worse than that, like an absolutely shameless and depraved brute who thinks he can get away with anything. Romeo-y-Cohiba Well, well. How do you like that! Then let me tell you something. That sickening stunt you pulled yesterday left me feeling like I\u0027d been defiled. It\u0027s like I\u0027ve had some foul substance sprayed into my soul and it fogs up my mind and takes away the desire to go on living. IsoldA On the subject of sprays of filth that take away the desire to go on living, you\u0027ve hit the nail on the head there. My fingers would have refused to type that. Even though it\u0027s exactly what I feel. I never even suspected that such a small opening ... Romeo-y-Cohiba That\u0027s enough. I don\u0027t want the last thing you hear - that is see - from me to be this mean abuse. So stop right there. Did you notice how long it took me to get there yesterday? Do you know why? I couldn\u0027t find the way at first, someone had changed all the marks I left at the turns. I got lost and wandered into a place I\u0027d never been before. The path ran into a dead-end with an old-fashioned red phone box with the British royal coat of arms. The kind they used to have in London. I went in. There was a plaque with the words: \u0027Hampton Court Maze, Blind Alley #4, East\u0027. And written in pencil under that was a telephone number and the name Isolde. I tried calling for ages. The line was engaged all the time, and finally I realised it would never be free. But, every time I dialled the number, for a few seconds I believed the next moment I would hear your voice. My Losolde. My Legalita. And that hope, that mute tremor in my soul, like when you pick up speed hurtling down the ski-jump before you launch out into the mist, all the feelings I had time to feel while the dial was turning back to its starting point, gently clicking out the final digit of your false number, that inverted infinity of the figure eight - it was happiness. The figure eight, like two tender sets of lips one above the other, and a blurred row of bushes through the window ... IsoldA How very touching, I think I\u0027ll burst into tears. Only I don\u0027t understand how after such exalted emotions you could do ... that ... I don\u0027t even know what to call it. It was enough to make even a paedophile puke. Romeo-y-Cohiba But what did I do? You did absolutely everything yourself. The only thing I have to reproach myself with is not offering any resistance. Though that was what I really wanted to do, even before it really began to hurt. IsoldA How can you lie so brazenly? But then, what else can I expect from you? Monstradamus Pardon me for butting in, I know you can\u0027t stand it. But perhaps I could set you thinking in a new direction. On the map that Isolde saw in the park it said \u0027Plan of the labyrinth at Versailles\u0027. But the telephone booth that Romeo was calling her from is located, if we can believe the plaque, in a suburb of London. Do you see what I\u0027m driving at? Nutscracker I wouldn\u0027t take those signs seriously. The Versailles outside Isolde\u0027s door is about as real as Romeo\u0027s London. Ugly would say the devil has us all exactly where he wants us. And she\u0027d be absolutely right. Monstradamus I wouldn\u0027t argue with that. But every dimension has its own intrinsic laws. And even if we are somewhere in the suburbs of Hell, when one person sees \u0027Versailles\u0027 and another sees \u0027London\u0027, there\u0027s good reason to assume the devil\u0027s holding them in different places. IsoldA What gibberish. Romeo-y-Cohiba That\u0027s way over the top. Monstradamus But really, Romeo and Isolde, what made you think you were close to each other? Romeo-y-Cohiba Everything around us is the same. Nutscracker What exactly? Bushes? Bushes are the same everywhere. Monstradamus Especially the word \u0027bushes\u0027 on two different screens. Romeo-y-Cohiba Even the soil under our feet is the same colour. Beige. Monstradamus Beige - what colour is that? Romeo-y-Cohiba How do you mean, what colour? Monstradamus Can you describe it some other way? Romeo-y-Cohiba Dark-brown. IsoldA What\u0027s that - dark-brown? Beige is light yellow-grey! Nutscracker Right. So now we know. Romeo set off to meet Isolde and bumped into Juliet. Isolde set out to meet Romeo and ended up in Tristan\u0027s clutches. If we imagine that Juliet and Tristan are the same person ... Although in this case we can hardly call it a real \u0027person\u0027. More like an empty mask. Or maybe a \u0027helmet\u0027? Romeo-y-Cohiba Listen, you xxx linguist, shut your mouth! Nutscracker It\u0027s certainly a frightening metaphor. There\u0027s nothing new about succubuses and incubuses, of course, but in this appalling dimension we have the spectral manifestation of a certain Julietristan who manages to take the place of not just one partner, but both at once. UGLI 666 And not only in this dimension. Why is fornication such a detestable sin? The Church teaches us it\u0027s because the fornicator blinded by lust is really copulating with the laughing devil. Organizm(-: Romeo, did you hear any laughter from behind the wall? Nutscracker How very instructive. The Helmholtz doesn\u0027t even know who he\u0027s xxx. Or who\u0027s xxx him. A drawing on the wall, a few flickers in the eyepieces of the helmet, but the true recipient of his passion remains profoundly anonymous. Organizm(-: I don\u0027t quite get it. How does the Minotaur manage to take the place of both partners at once? Are you saying he xxx himself? Nutscracker No. With Romeo he\u0027s Isolde, and with Isolde he\u0027s Romeo. But what you said is an even more interesting idea. Well worth thinking about. Well, lady and gent, pardon my lack of modesty, but what exactly did happen in the pavilion? My imagination blushes and fails me. Nothing that comes to mind is worthy of the emotions that we have observed. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s very hard to come with your finger up your bum\u0027 or the last tango in Paris. I\u0027m thinking in banal terms, of course. Romeo, can you elaborate? Romeo-y-Cohiba Yes, I can. If you stick your nose into our lives once more, I\u0027ll find you and xxx you so hard your brains will be thinking their filthy thoughts across the wall, understand? Nutscracker I wonder exactly how you plan to find me? I\u0027m not Isolde - there\u0027s no trapdoor between us. There wasn\u0027t even one between you two, as it happened ... Romeo-y-Cohiba Just remember that if I look hard enough I might just find one. Nutscracker I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re getting so het up about. Did the knife slip when they were circumcising your cochiba ? It wasn\u0027t me, you half-wit, it was your Julistan. Romeo-y-Cohiba That\u0027s it. Nutcracker, I\u0027m on my way to kill you. Nutscracker I couldn\u0027t give a xxx. I\u0027m wearing a helmet of horror. Ariadne There\u0027s no need to be like that. Organizm(-: Julistan - it sounds like the name of some small but highly malevolent state located at the very centre of the axis of evil. Ariadne By the way, I\u0027ve seen that word - Julistan. Monstradamus Where? Ariadne In that place where I was asking the dwarf questions. The archive. Monstradamus You didn\u0027t say anything about that. Ariadne When the dwarf ran off, I was left in the archive alone. At first I went on sitting at the table, waiting for him to come back. But he was gone for ages and ages. Then I got up and went over to look at the shelves of files along the walls. There were all sorts of different things on them. Depositions from the Minotaur\u0027s defeated enemies. Interrogations of Minotaurs by other Minotaurs. An entire shelf full of records of cross-examinations of Minotaurs by themselves - they were called \u0027Alone Together\u0027. They must have been thinking of the horns, right? But the biggest number of files was filled with answers to the so-called eternal questions like the ones you and I were asking. They were all old and yellow with age and covered in dust. Do you know what paper covered with writing smells like when the people who wrote on it are already dead? Monstradamus Do you remember anything? Ariadne I have a whole pile of pages here from various files. When I woke up they were lying beside the dwarf \u0027s answers. There\u0027s not much new in them. The eternal questions haven\u0027t got any cleverer - that\u0027s why they\u0027re eternal. Monstradamus Read us something. Ariadne Question: \u0027Why does the existent exist?\u0027 Answer: \u0027To pass the time more pleasantly.\u0027 Question: \u0027Why heap up so many events and beings to pass the time if in any case nowhere exists except in the helmet of horror?\u0027 Answer: \u0027Events and beings also cannot be accumulated anywhere except in the helmet of horror, so Mesdames et Messieurs are requested not to be concerned.\u0027 What\u0027s next ... About the separator labyrinth ... \u0027But who ...\u0027 Right, that\u0027s it: \u0027Who else is produced there?\u0027 A couple of pages from some review of historical chronicles. An analysis of contradictions. One text says the Minotaur himself is the builder of the labyrinth. Another claims the labyrinth was built by eighteen thousand Minotaurs divided into two columns. A third claims these columns should be understood metaphorically and the labyrinth is created by the two mental nodules or hemispheres, which are symbolised by the two horns. And so on. And here at the end there are a few pages about this Julistan. They look quite different, really ancient and faded. Many of them are so old I can hardly make anything out. Covered with strange, beautiful handwriting. They\u0027re translations of inscriptions from the Julistan caves. The actual inscriptions were destroyed long ago, together with the caves themselves, and all that\u0027s left are copies of copies. Fragmentary translations. Some are short and incoherent, some are a bit longer. Shall I read some? Monstradamus Certainly. Ariadne \u0027One may begin with whatever one likes, without worrying about it at all ...\u0027 Monstradamus Begin what? Ariadne You seem to be worrying about it already. Wait, that\u0027s not the right page. Here\u0027s the beginning: \u0027Asterius is everything that is before us and within us, especially \"before\" and \"within\". Irrupting into the mind he simulates this world and our own reason with all its voices, which dispute so convincingly with each other. To understand this means to see Asterius. One may begin with whatever one likes, without worrying about it at all ...\u0027 UGLI 666 Instead of listening to this drivel, shouldn\u0027t we perhaps be thinking about what to do in real reality? I didn\u0027t like the sound of those words about blood that is about be spilled. Ariadne \u0027The true hidden name of Asterius, which gives power over him, is Asterius, which is We. For many years the magicians of ancient times cut away the final letters of all the inscriptions so that no one would understand ...\u0027 UGLI 666 We\u0027re wasting precious time. Ariadne The next sheet: \u0027Man is like unto a tree. The thoughts in his head are like the songs of birds in the crown of the tree. How many birds must sing in unison for that which we consider ourselves to appear? And does the tree truly possess a song of its own? Asterius is also created after this fashion ...\u0027 UGLI 666 Someone shut that crazy woman up. Ariadne \u0027Asterius\u0027 greatest secret is that he is entirely unnecessary. He is an incorruptible guard, guarding that which he himself has created against that which he himself has created. For all the severity of his visage and magnificence of his station, all that is created by him, yea and his own self, is pure superfluity, the empty play of mind, a counterfeit golden flourish on the border of the void. And therefore, when within this nothingness set in a richly ornamented frame the menace of necessity suddenly raises its head or implacable battle is joined for the triumph of true values, there arises a spectacle fit to induce laughter unto tears, because in truth all of this from the beginning to the end is entirely pointless ...\u0027 Monstradamus What\u0027s that sound? Can anyone else hear it? Ariadne \u0027But one must laugh quietly or Asterius will take offence. He does not know that in reality he does not exist, but sometimes he begins to suspect it and this scares and angers him greatly. The means by which for many millennia he has attempted to make himself real are terrible and foolish, like all the mysteries of his world. Although he does not exist, he ends up drenched in sweat and blood, which also do not exist. Though this does not make him any more real, it does mean there is no one left to tell him so - no one is left at his side but servant dwarves, drenching him in blood and screaming that vengeance will follow for the blood that has been spilled ...\u0027 IsoldA I can hear it too. It\u0027s terrifying. Ariadne \u0027Asterius should not be feared. If you fear him, it means that you are wearing the helmet of horror and he is master of your world. But once you have removed the helmet, then Asterius disappears, and nothing remains at which to laugh. It is a grave error either to wear the helmet or to remove it. One should do absolutely nothing with it, if only because in reality it does not exist...\u0027 UGLI 666 Closer and closer, and still this stupid cow just won\u0027t ... Ariadne \u0027You are free, and your freedom lies in the fact that the mind has no body, no matter what dwarves in strange hats may tell you. Even the body has no body, and therefore there is nothing on which to set the helmet of horror. But until you have understood this, Asterius is all that you see, feel, think and know. And the crude mechanical farce which the parts of the helmet play out for each other in the transparent void of the mind becomes your entire life. If you are wearing the helmet of horror, it seems that this is for all eternity. But no eternity lasts longer than a fleeting moment. And it is known beforehand what will be when that moment is past - you will recall who you truly are and see that the helmet of horror is merely a toy of your own devising ...\u0027 Nutscracker What\u0027s happening? Help! I think that idiot Romeo ... Monstradamus What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s that rumbling sound? Nutscracker I think he really has found me. If it\u0027s him. Someone\u0027s hammering like hell on the door from the outside. Or it ... Romeo-y-Cohiba It\u0027s not me. The same thing\u0027s happening here. Blows of terrifying power ... Organizm(-: The door\u0027s giving way. UGLI 666 The final hour has come! Repent! I adjure you in the sign of the cross!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-16.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
