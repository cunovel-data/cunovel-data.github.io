Let\u0027s try it a step at a time. Where does perception arise?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n It\u0027s produced in the separator labyrinth.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n From what?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n From the past. It was there in the past, wasn\u0027t it?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n It was.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Then why should it suddenly disappear from the present and the future?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Where\u0027s Nutcracker got to? I can\u0027t make sense of all this on my own.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I\u0027m following your discussion with intense interest.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n My helmet of horror\u0027s about to overheat. Let me put the question a different way. If Asterisk, perception and everything else are produced in the separator labyrinth, then why do we say that it\u0027s Asterisk who perceives them?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n The dwarf said that is simply his specific quality as a product. In other words, the idea that he perceives everything is produced in the separator labyrinth together with everything else.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Produced from what?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n From nothing. You haven\u0027t been listening properly.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n All right. Then I have a question as well. You say Asterisk appears in the separator labyrinth.\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n That\u0027s right.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And instead of a head he has the helmet of horror?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Yes.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n But then that means the helmet of horror appears in the separator labyrinth, which is located inside the helmet itself?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Yes, it does.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n But the helmet has to be bigger than one of its parts. How can it be located inside one of its own components?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n The dwarf said \u0027inside\u0027 and \u0027outside\u0027 only exist in the horns of plenty. The same thing applies to \u0027bigger\u0027 and \u0027smaller\u0027. The horns contain absolutely everything you could possibly imagine and everything else as well.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n But in that case even the helmet only exists in these horns of plenty?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Yes, I think so.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Whichever way you look at it, that means the helmet of horror arises inside one of its own component parts. But it exists inside a different one. Where\u0027s the sense in that?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Where? In the horns of plenty, of course.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Ariadne, are you serious?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Yes, probably. Or perhaps not. To be quite honest, I\u0027m tired. If I meet the dwarf, I\u0027ll make sure I ask him about everything. You think up some questions.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Hang on a moment. How did the dream end?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n After the lecture I went out into the corridor. There was no one there, just a big mirror in a semicircular frame on the wall. I went over and looked into it and woke up.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n What did you see in it?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n Myself.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n And nothing unusual?\\n\\n Ariadne\\n\\n I was wearing a straw hat with a round crown and two little bunches of lilies-of-the-valley pinned to the brim at the back. The hat had a veil of thick lace with round holes, so I couldn\u0027t see my face behind it at all. It all looked very beautiful, but something made me feel nervous. I couldn\u0027t work out what was wrong until suddenly I recognised that bronze mask in my reflection and that frightened me, and then the dream suddenly ended. That\u0027s all. I\u0027m going.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n I thought from the very beginning that goon must be wearing a virtual reality helmet. Honest I did.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n That\u0027s not any kind of virtual reality helmet; it\u0027s some kind of fancy pressure cooker. Games for children. I ought to know how a virtual reality helmet works when grown-ups put one together, and this is nothing like it.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n And how does it work?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Maybe I don\u0027t understand too well which way the current flows and what it\u0027s transformed into and all, but I do know perfectly well what someone in one of those helmets sees and thinks, because I\u0027ve dealt with it as a professional, by studying the problem of choice in an interactive environment. We worked with those helmets all the time.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n I\u0027ve never heard of that problem. What is it?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Well, imagine you decide for yourself who\u0027s going to shoot who when you\u0027re watching an action movie. If you decide the main hero gets killed in the first shootout, then what happens to the rest of the plot? If you had genuinely free choice, the results could be pretty miserable. But art is supposed to make us happy, not miserable.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n That\u0027s for sure. And even when it does make us miserable, we should feel happy in our misery.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n That\u0027s right! So there never is any genuine interactivity, only the appearance of it. Or rather, it is permitted, but only within a narrow range where no choice you make can change the fundamental situation. The main problem is to eliminate freedom of choice so that the subject is led unerringly to make the decision required, while at the same time maintaining his firm belief that his choice is free. In scientific terms it\u0027s known as coercive orientation.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n What\u0027s that?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n That\u0027s a long story.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n We don\u0027t have much else to occupy ourselves with.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Tell us about it, Nutcracker. Let\u0027s give our brains a break.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I suppose there\u0027s no need to explain what the Helmholtz sees?\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Who?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n In professional jargon that\u0027s what they call the guy in the helmet. A Helmholtz is someone who\u0027s located in an artificial dimension that totally isolates him from the real world and moves around in it, or rather, thinks he moves around in it. Let\u0027s assume this dimension takes the form of a flat area with three identical marble vases standing on it. And what we have to do to keep the action moving in the right direction is to lead the Helmholtz to the middle vase.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Three identical marble vases. Hardly makes it worth bothering to put the helmet on.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Instead of vases they could be doors, turns at a road junction, any kind of choice at all in fact. It\u0027s not important. Everything you see in the helmet is computed by a special program and the program can be set up so that, every time, the Helmholtz makes the same choice we made for him earlier.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Sure, you can fix the program, but not the experimental subject. He\u0027s got his own programming.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n That\u0027s the whole point. When the helmet and the Helmholtz fuse into a single whole, you can edit the reader as well as the book, if you get my meaning. That\u0027s why we say editing technology can be external or internal. Although there\u0027s no clear boundary between them, of course.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Come again?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n External technologies affect what we see, internal technologies affect what we think.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n How about an example?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n The simplest external editing program is \u0027Sticky Eye\u0027. That\u0027s when, as you turn your head, one of the vases gets stuck in the field of vision and lingers there longer than it should.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n But what about the two other vases? They\u0027re standing next to it. According to the laws of perspective ...\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n How perspective operates inside the helmet is decided by us and our client. Another method is called \u0027The Weight\u0027. When the Helmholtz tries to move away from our vase, the program slows down his movement. And when he approaches, it speeds his movement up. As though we\u0027ve tied a mathematical weight to his foot and it keeps disappearing and reappearing again. That makes it easier to move towards the chosen vase than in any other direction, and disorganised series of random displacements will bring the Helmholtz to it pretty quickly.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n A mathematical weight. That\u0027s beautiful.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n The next technology up is \u0027Pavlov\u0027s Bitch\u0027. That\u0027s an intermediate conditioned reflex editor.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n So it\u0027s named after that Russian scientist who noticed his stomach juices started flowing when the phone rang?\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n No he didn\u0027t, he just studied conditioned reflexes in dogs.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I didn\u0027t invent the name. When you look at the vases that we want to exclude from your list, your vision starts blurring and rippling and you get a horrible buzzing in your ears, or even an electric shock. So you won\u0027t look at them again.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n But you\u0027d notice that straightaway.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n We want you to notice it straightaway, draw the right conclusion and look in the right direction in future. It\u0027s a cheap technology for third-world countries. But if the budget\u0027s big enough, then for instance we can use infrasonics. The Helmholtz won\u0027t notice anything, but he\u0027ll experience a dark, mysterious horror when he turns towards any vase except the one we want. The obverse method is stimulation of the pleasure centre when the correct choice is made. They used to insert an electrode, but now it\u0027s done by pharmacological means or by entraining the brain to delta rhythms.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n You don\u0027t say. Are you telling me they\u0027ll be doing all that stuff to us if we watch interactive movies?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I don\u0027t think so. These techniques weren\u0027t developed for the movies, not even for virtual spaces. They were just modelled there. The topic is not in the public domain. But since you and I aren\u0027t in the public domain either, I suppose it\u0027s okay for me to tell you about it.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n So what are the internal editing programs like?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Well, for instance, take \u0027Sunny Kiss\u0027. The vase we have to choose is endowed with positive emotional coloration by employing universally accepted aesthetic codes, given a positive inner content, if you like.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n Inner content. Would that be inside the vase or inside the viewer?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n That\u0027s a difficult question. You could say it\u0027s inside the helmet. But all that\u0027s just words. It\u0027s easier for me to explain how it\u0027s done. Say a ray of sunlight falls on our vase, or you hear a soulful melody in the air when it enters your field of view. The reverse technique is \u0027Doom and Gloom\u0027. For instance, when you look at a vase we don\u0027t like, the sun is covered by dark clouds, a grey fog comes down and you hear unpleasant noises.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Fair enough. What else?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n There\u0027s another technology called \u0027The Seventh Seal\u0027. The vase that has to be chosen is marked out using secret signs that attract interest or stimulate the imagination. It can be absolutely anything - a hand print on its surface, arrows pointing to it on the ground, a dove sitting on its edge, mysterious graffiti, and so on and so forth. The obverse method is \u0027The Le Pen Club\u0027. That\u0027s when the vases we wish to exclude are covered in the crudest obscenities you can imagine, preferably not even in paint, but xxx. Virtual, of course.\\n\\n Organizm(-: \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-7.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
