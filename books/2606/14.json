He looked into the eyes of his imaginary viewer, waved his arms about like an eagle flapping its wings and yelled: \u0027Minotaure! Minotaure, c\u0027est toi!! Tu es Minotaure!!!\u0027 Then he calmed down. He said you simply have to understand that the Minotaur is a projection of your mind and therefore he is nobody else but you.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Did he say what we ought to do?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n What else? As long as there\u0027s a sponsor, carry on with the discourse!\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n But what turns do we make in the labyrinth?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n We follow the turns the discourse takes.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Interesting.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n To be honest, I didn\u0027t really understand what a discourse is, even after the hairy guy had just been talking about it.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n It\u0027s something like a glue that sticks the helmet of horror on really solidly. So you can\u0027t get it off again.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Don\u0027t frighten me.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n You\u0027re the one who\u0027s been frightening me for the last hour. Were there any women candidates?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Yes. There was one very attractive little heifer who looked like a psychiatrist. Her symbol was right for that, too: a bull on a chain lying on a couch. I don\u0027t remember everything she said now, but the main idea was that the only way to defeat the Minotaur is to stop thinking of yourself as a victim. Then he\u0027ll simply disappear. Everyone has his own Minotaur, she said, but in reality it\u0027s not he who pursues us, we pursue him. And the labyrinth in which we seek him is the dopamine chains of pleasure linking up into rings in the human brain - they\u0027re different for everyone, as unique as fingerprints. And as for which turns to make in the labyrinth, it\u0027s all very simple. Suppose you\u0027re standing at an intersection with ten identical corridors leading in different directions. Then of course your choice of which corridor to follow should not be determined by fears and superstitions, but by the promptings of simple common sense.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n So did you make a choice?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n How do you mean? Between corridors?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Between candidates.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I\u0027m not really sure what position I\u0027d be choosing the candidate for. Or what institution, or what term. Or how he\u0027d be going to lead me out of the labyrinth, when the room has no doors or windows.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n He\u0027ll lead you out through the television. How else? You of all people should understand that. Is there anything else you remember?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I watched it all on fast forward, just listened to each one for about five minutes to get the general idea. As long as they\u0027re talking it all seems interesting and new. Then you wind on the cassette and you\u0027ve forgotten it all. Some American or other said that the labyrinth is the Internet. That it\u0027s inhabited by a some being that hacks into the mind, and that\u0027s the Minotaur. It\u0027s not really a bull-man, it\u0027s a spider-man. He said if there\u0027s a worldwide web, then there must be a soul-sucking spider. He also explained why the Minotaur has two names. It seems that \u0027Minotaur\u0027 is the politically correct version of the name \u0027Asterisk\u0027. So every time we want to say \u0027Asterisk\u0027, we should say \u0027Minotaur\u0027. But then \u0027Asterisk\u0027 is the politically correct version of the name \u0027Minotaur\u0027, and every time we want to say \u0027Minotaur\u0027 we should say \u0027Asterisk\u0027. And so in principle we can use both names, only not when we want to, but the other way round. There was an interesting German who said that the Minotaur is the spirit of the time, the Zeitgeist , which has manifested itself in the form of mad cow disease, hence its symbolic representation in the form of a man with a bull\u0027s head. Its counterpart in art is postmodernism, which is the mad cow disease of a culture forced to feed on its own powdered bones. And in politics it\u0027s all that stuff you see and feel when you switch on the television. Then there was an Italian, dressed in black, who announced that the Minotaur - he said \u0027Mondotaur\u0027 - is a being whose physical body is the gross dollar supply. It\u0027s stupid to believe that everything is controlled through money, he said - why through it and not by money itself? The Mondotaur is the evil spirit that reigns over the world, and compels every single one of us to wander aimlessly through the foul, stinking labyrinth of his intestines. And his two horns are ... I\u0027ve forgotten.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n It doesn\u0027t matter, I can imagine.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Then a priest with kind eyes spoke and explained that the creator of the labyrinth is also our saviour, who loves us greatly. In much the same way as we love little children, he said.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n And what proposals did they all have?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n It all came down to how many times to turn right and how many times to turn left, and in which order. Everyone wanted to do it his own way.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Perhaps that\u0027s the whole point. Not to think about where the way out is, but to realise that life is the crossroads where you\u0027re standing at this precise moment. Then the labyrinth will disappear as well. After all it only exists as a complete whole in our minds, and in reality there is nothing but a simple choice - which way to go next.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Uhuh. And the Minotaur won\u0027t do anything to us, because the present \u0027us\u0027 will no longer exist when he catches up with us. One of them said that as well.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n And now what\u0027s outside your door, Monstradamus? It\u0027s about time you told us, you\u0027re the only one left.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n You\u0027ll be disappointed, Organism.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n We\u0027ll see. So what have you got?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n A dead-end.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I don\u0027t get it.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n A corridor a few metres long ending in a blank concrete wall with a single depressing graffito . Or at least I find it depressing. The imprint of a gigantic seal drawn in fluorescent lilac paint, like something on an official document from Hell. In the centre is the Roman numeral \u0027VII\u0027 and running out from it in a spiral is an endless string of symbols like the ones that street-gangs leave on walls. Nothing but zigzags, intricate curls, arrows and brackets - impossible to make out a single word. But all very suggestive.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Just a dead-end?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n That\u0027s all there is.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n All there is?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Well, not quite. There\u0027s a table standing against the wall directly under the seal. And a stool by the table. And on the table there\u0027s a blank sheet of paper, a pencil and a pistol with a single bullet.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n What about the labyrinth?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n I think that starts afterwards.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Truly magnificent simplicity and elegance.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n There\u0027s nothing for you to be envious of. You\u0027ve got a dead-end too, only it\u0027s longer and it has plywood partitions. And Nutcracker\u0027s got a television instead of plywood. We\u0027ve all got dead-ends. Only it\u0027s not obvious straightaway, it just takes a little while.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Maybe that\u0027s the whole point - whether it\u0027s obvious straightaway or not. Don\u0027t you think the \u0027little while\u0027 it takes might just be life?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Maybe so. But I\u0027m fed up of these labyrinths you can\u0027t get lost in or escape from. And all these Minotaurs with horns on their xxx who promise to lead us out to the stars in just a moment. I wonder what Theseus will see instead of all this. I\u0027d give a lot to find out.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n What do you care what he\u0027ll see?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n IMHO, Nutcracker, the possibility of escape is determined by whether you can see the way out or not.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I already told you, for the Helmholtz that\u0027s not exactly the way it is. The Helmholtz can see anything you like. Even the plan of his own helmet. For all the good it will do him.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n What I wonder is, has he got a head on his shoulders or a helmet of horror? Hey, Theseus! I know you can hear me!\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n To be honest, Monstradamus, I used to think you were Theseus.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n I was convinced Monstradamus was the Minotaur.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n I already told you, it all depends on which part of the separator labyrinth the bubble of hope was in when it burst.\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Didn\u0027t you ever think I was Theseus?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Well hello, Sartrik! You know, not even once ...\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n Somehow the idea never entered my head.\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Organism, it\u0027s clear from your userpic that you\u0027re queer. Just look at that guilty smile and that gaping xxx.\\n\\n Organizm(-:\\n\\n That\u0027s it, I\u0027m going. You can talk to him.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Sartrik, that isn\u0027t a userpic. Perhaps we can call it a dialogue header. And that isn\u0027t a gaping xxx, it\u0027s a capital \u0027O\u0027.\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Monstradamus just said - right? - that everything is determined by what you see. I take that to mean that if someone can see the answer to the most important question of all, then he is Theseus. Am I right, Monstradamus?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Possibly. But exactly what is the most important question of all?\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Let me explain. Have you noticed that we never exist simultaneously, only by turns?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n An interesting observation. You mean the writing on the screen?\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n I mean in general. Since you didn\u0027t understand the question, I\u0027ll ask it a different way. The helmet of horror is a machine. What does it run on? What does it have instead of petrol?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n He\u0027s lost it, Monster. Delirium tremens . He needs a drip installed.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Wait, Nutcracker. So what does it have instead of petrol?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Vodka?\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Why vodka? Do you think I\u0027m a drunken xxx and I don\u0027t understand a thing? Instead of petrol it has Theseus.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Explain that, please.\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n You remember Ariadne looking into the mirror and seeing that hat with a veil, and afterwards she realised it was the helmet of horror? The petrol that the whole deal was running on was her, get it? Everything\u0027s made out of the person who sees it. Because it can\u0027t possibly be made out of anything else. Without the person there won\u0027t be any hat or any veil, or any lilies-of-the-valley. Nothing. Get it? Theseus is the one who looks into the mirror, and the Minotaur is the one he sees, because he\u0027s wearing a helmet of horror.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n You mean to say the Minotaur is just an illusion?\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n If you listened to what I\u0027m saying, then you\u0027d know what I\u0027m trying to say. He sees this bronze phizog with horns on it because he sees himself in the mirror through the holes. Without Theseus there is no xxx Minotaur.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Did you get that, Monster?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Naturally. If you put on a Batman mask and look in the mirror, you\u0027ll see Batman. But the mask will never see itself.\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n That\u0027s it. The helmet of horror is simply the reflection that Theseus sees, and that\u0027s all. But if he decides there really is a Minotaur and starts swearing blind at him and discussing the meaning of life with him, well that\u0027s when the Minotaur appears. And how! And then there\u0027s no way to get the helmet of horror off again. Get it now, you vermin? I know everything.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I bet you he can see little pink Minotaurs running round the room. Now that\u0027s the kind of labyrinth I understand! And no need to bother going anywhere.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n And why are we vermin?\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Because you\u0027re all nothing but bits and pieces of the helmet of horror. I figured that out ages ago. And that\u0027s the real xxx killer, when you realise that absolutely everybody - all your friends and all your enemies - are just little bits and pieces! I\u0027m not talking about you. Meaning you\u0027re not my friends. And not my enemies. But you\u0027re bits and pieces, all right. You, Monstradamus, and you, Nutcracker - you\u0027re the horns. You\u0027ll stick out a bit too far some day. Ariadne\u0027s the labyrinth, but she\u0027s not such a bad girl, she\u0027s okay. Ugly\u0027s the past that makes me want to puke. And Organism\u0027s the future, that makes me want to puke five times worse. Who\u0027s left? Romeo and that Isolde of his? They\u0027re the double xxx that\u0027s cooking up the whole xxx mess.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And so you\u0027re Theseus?\\n\\n Sartrik\\n\\n Yes. Because I never talk to you.\\n\\n Nutscracker \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-14.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
