Is there anyone there ...?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I\u0027m here.\n Organizm(-:\n So what\u0027s going on round here?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Your guess is as good as mine.\n Organizm(-:\n Ariadne, are you there?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Who\u0027s she?\n Organizm(-:\n She started this thread. Seems this isn\u0027t the Internet, just looks like it. You can\u0027t link to anywhere else from here.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n xxx\n Organizm(-:\n Hello! If anyone can read this, please answer.\n Nutscracker\n I can read it.\n Organizm(-:\n Who posted the first message?\n Nutscracker\n It\u0027s been up on the board a long time.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n How can you tell? There\u0027s no date on it.\n Nutscracker\n I saw it three hours ago.\n Organizm(-:\n Attention, roll-call. There\u0027s just Nutcracker, Romeo and me here, is that right?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n That\u0027s right.\n Nutscracker\n At least, we\u0027re the only ones who want to join in.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Right, so there are three of us here.\n Nutscracker\n But where is here exactly?\n Organizm(-:\n How do you mean?\n Nutscracker\n Quite literally. Can you describe where you are now? What is it - a room, a hall, a house? A hole in someone\u0027s xxx?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Well I\u0027m in a room, anyway. Or a cell, I can\u0027t tell which is more correct. Not very big. Green walls, white ceiling lamp. A bed by one wall and by the opposite wall a desk with the keyboard I\u0027m typing on right now. The keyboard is attached rigidly to the desk. Above the desk there\u0027s an LCD screen set in the wall behind thick glass. That\u0027s where all these letters appear. It\u0027s impossible to break, I tried already. The room has two doors, one made of strange, blackish-green metal. It\u0027s locked. There\u0027s a raised section in the middle of it. The other door\u0027s made of wood, painted white, and it leads into a bathroom. It\u0027s open.\n Organizm(-:\n I\u0027ve got the same as Romeo. A locked metal door with some kind of relief design on it. A hotel-style bathroom with soap, shower gel and shampoo on the shelf under the mirror. Everything in packaging marked with a strange symbol - something like a little cogwheel. So where are you, Nutcracker?\n Nutscracker\n In the same kind of room. I think the door\u0027s made of cast bronze. But Organism, the symbol on the soap looks more like a star than a cogwheel. In fact it looks like the symbol they use in books for a footnote. It\u0027s even on the loo paper, every sheet.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n So we\u0027re all in the same hotel. Let\u0027s try knocking on the walls. Can you hear anything?\n Organizm(-:\n No.\n Nutscracker\n Me neither.\n Organizm(-:\n I\u0027ll try knocking on the door, listen.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I can\u0027t hear a thing.\n Organizm(-:\n So how did we get here?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Personally speaking, I haven\u0027t got the slightest idea. How about you, Organism?\n Organizm(-:\n I just woke up here wearing this pooftah\u0027s housecoat with nothing underneath it.\n Nutscracker\n It\u0027s not a housecoat. It\u0027s a chiton - the kind of tunic the ancient Greeks used to wear, so I won\u0027t take issue with your opinion of it. I don\u0027t think they wore any underclothes either.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n It\u0027s a good job it\u0027s warm in here then.\n Organizm(-:\n So, maybe you remember how you got here, Nutcracker?\n Nutscracker\n No, I don\u0027t.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Why have you two got such odd names - Organizm, Nutscracker?\n Nutscracker\n Well, why have you got such an odd name, Romeo? Is your cohiba really such a whopper?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I suppose that depends whose you compare it with. And anyway, it wasn\u0027t me who invented the name. It just appears on the screen when I send a message. I\u0027m not Romeo, I\u0027m xxx. A professional xxx, if anyone\u0027s interested.\n Organizm(-:\n Porn business? Socially significant work. You and I are almost colleagues, Romeo - I\u0027m a xxx. I used to work at xxx.com, so I\u0027m temporarily out of a job. But there\u0027s not much danger of that for you.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n How did the porn business get mixed up in all this? And what are all these x\u0027s?\n Nutscracker\n That\u0027s not the first time they\u0027ve appeared. It\u0027s the censor. Someone\u0027s monitoring our conversation. And he doesn\u0027t like it when we try to exchange information about who we really are. Or start swearing.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Hey, you, whoever you are! I demand that you allow me to contact my family immediately! And the xxx embassy!\n Nutscracker\n What makes you think there\u0027s a xxx embassy here?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n There\u0027s a xxx embassy everywhere.\n Nutscracker\n Are you sure? What if we\u0027re in xxx?\n Organizm(-:\n Apparently you guys can understand each other without words. But I don\u0027t understand what the xxx embassy is, and where xxx is, if there\u0027s no xxx embassy there. And what the xxx you want it for anyway.\n Monstradamus\n Hi there, is it okay if I join in your discussion?\n Organizm(-:\n Who are you, Monstradamus?\n Monstradamus\n xxx. I live in xxx and I\u0027m a xxx.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Perhaps you ought to try something a bit more original?\n Monstradamus\n I\u0027ve read all the messages on this thread. I\u0027m in the same situation, the same room, the same fancy getup. And I don\u0027t remember how I got here, either.\n Nutscracker\n So now we are four. That\u0027s nice.\n Organizm(-:\n What\u0027s so nice about it?\n Nutscracker\n Maybe more will turn up soon. The more heads we have, the better our chances of coming up with something.\n Organizm(-:\n And what if we\u0027ve simply died?\n Nutscracker\n Don\u0027t panic! Dead people don\u0027t hang around in chat rooms.\n Organizm(-:\n We don\u0027t know that for a fact. Maybe that\u0027s all they can do.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n If this is the afterlife, then I for one am disappointed.\n Nutscracker\n Let\u0027s discuss the situation. I suggest we don\u0027t take Organism\u0027s hypothesis about the afterlife into consideration.\n Organizm(-:\n Then maybe it\u0027s a dream?\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n Pinch yourself. Maybe you\u0027ll wake up. I tried already, it didn\u0027t work.\n Nutscracker\n Right, so everybody has a bronze door. Let\u0027s try figuring out the design on that door. It\u0027s a figure like a rectangle with the upper and lower edges bent inwards and the sides bent outwards.\n Organizm(-:\n It looks like a bat. Or the Batman symbol.\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\n I reckon it\u0027s a double-headed axe.\n Organizm(-:\n Maybe it\u0027s just decoration, without any meaning. But Romeo saying it looks like an axe has made me think so too. The fascists used to have axes like that - or was it the ancient Romans?\n Monstradamus\n If it is an axe, it\u0027s much older than Rome. They used to have axes like that in Crete and ancient Egypt.\n Organizm(-:\n Are you a historian then, Monstradamus?\n Monstradamus\n No. I\u0027m a xxx.\n Organizm(-:\n Hey, that\u0027s right. I forgot. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-1.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: \n Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
