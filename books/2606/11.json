The canon gave me a rosary and I\u0027m holding it in my hand. I\u0027m going to take a rest now.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Yes, Ugly, take a rest. After all you\u0027ve been through it will do you good.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n An interesting crossword puzzle. But from a mystical point of view, how do you explain that at the very centre of the labyrinth of life there lies the letter \u0027S\u0027?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n That ought to be clear enough to you of all people, Nutcracker.\\n\\n Nut$cracker\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n You have the same letter at your centre too. And just at the moment it\u0027s looking really lovely.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Where? Oh, that. That\u0027s the moderators taking the piss again. If that\u0027s what you had in mind, I can tell you the pay for my job is so low it\u0027s an insult.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Isolde, are you back yet?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Hi there, Romeo.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Are you IsoldA then?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Cohiba\u0027s in a bad mood today.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n I liked the phrase \u0027With every new second I was immersed deeper and deeper into the past.\u0027\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n Yes, I noticed that too.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Pure poetry. With every new day we slide deeper and deeper into the past. We disappear into it, like a diver sinking under the water in a slow-motion sequence. What is the difference between an old man and a young man if you put them side by side?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n One of them is old and one of them is young.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Yes, but what does that mean? That there is only a tiny little piece of the old man left in our dimension - he is almost completely submerged in Lethe\u0027s waters of oblivion. But the young man is still all here - he has just barely touched the surface of the water. Isn\u0027t that it?\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. The way things are these days, they could both go down together at any moment. And the size of the pieces would depend less on their age than the force of the blast.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n That\u0027s also true.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And, as for that phrase you liked, I think Ugly was thinking of the helmet of horror. The future is produced from the past, so the further we go into the future, the more past is required to produce it. You know, the closer you build to the stars, the deeper the pit you dig the soil out of ...\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Isolde, are you there? Isolde!\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n And, to complete the picture, you could say the bubbles of the past were bursting in a helmet that was running \u0027Sticky Eye\u0027 and \u0027Sunny Kiss\u0027 simultaneously.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n What?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Are you still here, Ugly? Take no notice, he\u0027s joking.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n I should never have told you.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Don\u0027t be offended, Ugly.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n I\u0027m never going to tell you anything again.\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Say you\u0027re sorry, Nutcracker.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n For what?\\n\\n Monstradamus\\n\\n Please, say you\u0027re sorry.\\n\\n Nutscracker\\n\\n All right. I\u0027m sorry, Ugly.\\n\\n UGLI 666\\n\\n God will forgive you.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Romeo, where are you? I\u0027m back.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I was starting to get worried. Tell me what happened.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n You first.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n All right. I would have reached the pavilion quickly, because last time I marked which way to go at the forks in the path. But I met someone really terrifying on the way.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n You too?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What happened? Are you all right?\\n\\n Isolde\\n\\n Yes, everything\u0027s fine. Go on.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n When I got past the bench where I can see the roof and the fountain, I suddenly sensed a movement behind me. And when I turned round I saw something absolutely incredible. Just imagine it, a long narrow corridor between the bushes. And coming towards me along it on roller skates was ... I don\u0027t even know if it was a man or not. He was immensely tall, wearing a sombrero hat and an ice-hockey goalkeeper\u0027s mask made of white plastic. And there were two smaller figures on roller skates behind him. I could hardly see them, because he took up the entire passage. He was wearing a goalkeeper\u0027s uniform too - an immense blue sweatshirt with the number \u002735\u0027 and the words \u0027chicago bulls\u0027. Or at least, that\u0027s what I thought at first. But when he got closer, I could see the number was actually totally weird: \u0027 - 3.5%\u0027, and the word \u0027bulls\u0027 was really \u0027BEARS\u0027. It was just that the minus sign and the percentage sign were the same colour as the sweatshirt and I hadn\u0027t spotted them from the distance. And he was holding a double hockey-stick.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n How do you mean?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n You\u0027ve seen a goalkeeper\u0027s stick, haven\u0027t you? Now imagine it has two blades curving in opposite directions. Of course, you couldn\u0027t possibly play with one like that.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n And what happened when he reached you?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n He didn\u0027t get that far. When he was only ten feet away, he turned a corner and disappeared into a side passage. And the others darted in there after him as well.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Who was it following him?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n It was two dwarves. They were on roller skates too, and wearing sombreros. I couldn\u0027t see their faces, they had their heads lowered so the wind wouldn\u0027t blow their hats off. And they were holding up the hem at the back of his sweatshirt, like ladies in waiting.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Was that all?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Fortunately, yes. Who did you meet?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n It was at the corner of one of the alleys. I heard the sound of a guitar string behind me. When I turned round, about twenty metres away from me I saw an immensely tall man standing beside a fountain. He was dressed all in black and gold like an eighteenth-century gallant, and he was hiding his face behind a mask in the form of a golden sun that he was holding on a stick. There were two dwarves dressed up in red velvet standing beside him, holding old potbellied guitars. They strummed a few soft chords, then the giant turned his mask slightly and the sun glinted on it so brightly I was dazzled and I screwed up my eyes. And when I opened them again there was no one beside the fountain any more. I didn\u0027t even have time to be scared and I thought I must have had a hallucination after everything I\u0027d been hearing. But now I don\u0027t know what to think. You go on.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Well, I decided that if the giant had wanted to kill me he would have done it already. So I carried on as though nothing had happened. I didn\u0027t meet anyone else on the way. The door in the wall of the pavilion was open. And behind it there was a winding corridor. Naturally, there was no light. The floorboards squeaked horribly, as if every one of them had three mice sitting under it. It was absolutely terrifying. There were doors in the walls and more doors behind them. I began groping my way at random through the musty, squeaking darkness and became disorientated straightaway. I was overcome by apathy. I wanted to drop down on the floor, close my eyes and forget about absolutely everything. Probably that\u0027s what I would have done, but then one of the doors led me out into a large room where there was a light on. It was deserted and dusty, with no windows and divided in half by a set of steel bars so thick they could have kept out an elephant. There was no furniture at all, if you didn\u0027t count several pictures turned around so that the images faced the wall. I thought it was probably so they wouldn\u0027t get dusty - clever and very simple, no need for any glass. Hanging on the door, which closed behind my back, was a plaque that said \u0027Silence!\u0027 And beyond the bars was a fresco with a portrait of the most beautiful girl I\u0027ve ever seen. Right across the whole wall.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n A girl right across the whole wall?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n No, the fresco. Some kind of garden full of wonderful plants and birds. And the girl was at the very centre, life-size. Absolutely naked, but it suited her really well. She had green hair that looked like grass, fluttering in the painted breeze. And green eyelashes too. She was lying in a mother-of-pearl shell, barely concealing the lower part of her belly with a bouquet of flowers. There was one strange thing, though - the edge of the shell above her head was covered with projections that looked like horns. And there were black rubber handles attached to them. That is, the projections were painted, but the handles were real, like in a bus. I touched them and I could tell it really was possible to hold on to them. But I couldn\u0027t understand what for.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n How could you touch them? You said there were bars between the door and the fresco.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n That\u0027s right. But it was easy enough to slip between the bars. So that\u0027s what I did. They probably weren\u0027t meant to keep out people.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Describe this girl.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n I suppose she was about eighteen, but she didn\u0027t look any older than fourteen. I\u0027d describe her pose as brazen, but entirely natural. What I mean is, the pose would have been absolutely brazen, if she\u0027d been lying there like that, knowing that she was being watched. But if she lay around like that at home, especially if it was hot, then of course, there wouldn\u0027t be anything brazen about it. But on the other hand, she was looking straight out of the picture at the spectator, which in this case meant straight at me. She had her eyes half-closed, as though she could see me and was taunting me, and she was smiling. And her eyes were as green as could be. I began to understand what the artist was trying to say. Either she\u0027d posed like that knowing she was being watched, which meant she was absolutely shameless, which I didn\u0027t want to believe. Or she\u0027d been lying like that because she thought there was no one around, and she was smiling at the spectator simply out of inertia, because she\u0027d only just noticed him. In that case the artist was a real genius, because he\u0027d caught the precise moment when her brain had already given the command to scream, but the command still hadn\u0027t reached the muscles of her throat. In that case, for as long as I carried on examining her, I was free of shame myself, so free in fact that it was actually arousing. In a word, genuine art. An absolutely enigmatic masterpiece. But I didn\u0027t have time to study her properly, because the bouquet she was using to conceal the lower part of her belly trembled and started sliding downwards. And it wasn\u0027t just the lower part of her belly she\u0027d been hiding, but the lowest part of all, so low you can\u0027t get any lower, only higher ...\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n All right, Romeo, I get the idea.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n There must have been some kind of mechanism in the wall. The arm that was holding the bouquet began turning from the elbow, like the hand of a clock. But I didn\u0027t get a chance to see what was behind the bouquet, because the light began to fade and soon it was completely dark. I went up to the wall and began feeling it with my hands. Where the bouquet had been quite a big gap had appeared. I put my hand into it carefully and suddenly felt something soft and alive that jerked away from me. I think it was another hand. I cried out in surprise and suddenly there was a spray of something acrid from the ceiling, like tear gas. I jumped back. The light started coming on. When it was bright enough to see, the bouquet was already back in place. My eyes were stinging really badly and I ran out of the room like it was a gas chamber.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Do your eyes still hurt?\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Not any more.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Now I see.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What do you see, Isolde?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n It seems I discovered the same amusement arcade from the other side. After the giant with the sun-mask disappeared, I went to the pavilion. The door was locked. And the windows too. I broke a window, lifted the latch and opened it. Behind the first door was the beginning of a dark, winding corridor like the one you told me about. From there I found my way into a large room with a light and no windows, just like you did. Instead of pictures it had mirrors painted over with white paint. Standing in the middle of the room was an absolutely huge steel ring as tall as the ceiling, with nylon mesh attached all around its edge - it hung down from the ring and trailed across the floor like a seine net. On the door there was a plaque about keeping silent, just like on yours. And on the wall behind the ring there was a mural, only it was very different from yours. It was a picture of something like the Grand Canyon. Through the mist I could make out the desert floor far below me. And on the edge of the red cliff, right up in front of the spectator\u0027s eyes, there was a car with a cloud of painted dust settling around it. It all looked just as though the car had braked after a steep turn and stopped at the very last moment, with its wheels hanging over the edge of the precipice. It was a Rolls-Royce jeep, in perfect profile, like a photo in an advert.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Are you sure it was a Rolls-Royce?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Of course. It had the initials \u0027RR\u0027 and a little Oscar with wings on the radiator, like they all have.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Then it wasn\u0027t a jeep. Rolls-Royce don\u0027t make jeeps.\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n Romeo, I can tell my SUV from my elbow. I even saw the name of the model - \u0027Full Drive Shadow\u0027 I think it was. That\u0027s the whole point. It was an artist\u0027s fantasy, but it was so convincing I could see straight away that if Rolls-Royce decided to make an SUV they\u0027d have to make the car that was painted there; circumstances would simply force them to do it. The jeep was made of gold and steel, like an exquisite watch. To say it looked impressive gives you no idea. If the space shuttle and the most expensive diamond necklace in the world could together produce a son, then it would probably look just like that when it grew up. In front of the jeep was a platform with steps. I mean the platform wasn\u0027t in the picture, it was on the floor of the room, real, made of wooden boards. And the jeep\u0027s windows were real too, tinted glass that looked black and there were skis and a surfboard on its roof.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Real ones?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n The skis and the board were painted. But the rack they were attached to, or that they looked as if they were attached to in the painting, was real, made of steel and gold.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n What kind of rack?\\n\\n IsoldA\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what its proper name is - the kind they make so you can tie on what you carry on the roof. There were loops of black leather hanging from it, like the ones used for doing gymnastics; they were real as well. And, apart from that, the door handles and the hub-caps were real - and they were made of steel and gold too.\\n\\n Romeo-y-Cohiba\\n\\n Did you try opening the door? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror/page-11.html","bookId":2606,"book":{"id":2606,"title":"The Helmet of Horror","description":"Storyline: Victor Pelevin, the iconoclastic and wildly interesting contemporary Russian novelist who The New Yorker named one of the Best European Writers Under 35, upends any conventional notions of what mythology must be with his unique take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. By creating a mesmerizing world where the surreal and the hyperreal collide, The Helmet of Horror is a radical retelling of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur set in an Internet chat room. They have never met, they have been assigned strange pseudonyms, they inhabit identical rooms that open out onto very different landscapes, and they have entered a dialogue they cannot escape - a discourse defined and destroyed by the Helmet of Horror. Its wearer is the dominant force they call Asterisk, a force for good and ill in which the Minotaur is forever present and Theseus is the great unknown. The Helmet of Horror is structured according to the way we communicate in the twenty-first century - using the Internet - yet instilled with the figures and narratives of classical mythology. It is a labyrinthine examination of epistemological uncertainty that radically reinvents this myth for an age where information is abundant but knowledge ultimately unattainable.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-helmet-of-horror.jpg","author":"Victor Pelevin","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-helmet-of-horror.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:44 PM"}}
