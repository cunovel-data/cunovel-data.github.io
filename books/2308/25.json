{"id":95472,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Pain. It was all he knew. He closed his eyes against the harsh glare of the sun, but there was no way to avoid its light, or its heat upon his naked flesh.\\n\\n Weak, so weak he couldn\u0027t concentrate, couldn\u0027t control his thoughts. Couldn\u0027t resist the memories . . .\\n\\n Of AnnaMara . . . smiling at him across a dinner table when he came courting. . . letting him steal a kiss . . . promising to love him for as long as she lived . . .\\n\\n AnnaMara . . . lying beside him, holding him in her arms.\\n\\n AnnaMara . . . giving birth to their daughter . . .\\n\\n Anguish, stronger and deeper than the pain of the flesh, roseup within him.\\n\\n AnnaMara . . . holding AnTares in her arms . . . how many mornings had he sat beside her while she nursed their daughter . . . how many nights had he listened to her sing the soft lullabys of ErAdona?\\n\\n AnnaMara . . . lying in a pool of her own blood . . . the life forever gone from her eyes. . .\\n\\n \"No!\" He opened his eyes and the images dissolved in the brilliant light of the sun.\\n\\n In an effort to avoid the light, Alex turned his head to the side, and saw Barrett staring down at him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m told sunlight bothers you,\" the doctor remarked. \"Is that correct?\"\\n\\n Alex hesitated, wondering whether to tell the truth, or if a lie would serve him better.\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n \"It bothers me,\" Alex said, thinking that \"bothered\" was an understatement at best.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll arrange to have the skylight covered during the afternoon. Will that help?\"\\n\\n Alex nodded, disgusted with himself for feeling grateful to the man.\\n\\n \"She told me you\u0027ve been here for two hundred years,\" Barrett remarked. \"I want toknow everything. Every detail of how you got here, where you came from, how you survived.\"\\n\\n Filled with nervous energy, the doctor paced the floor. \"Your race has mastered space travel. Have you explored other planets? Found life there? Are there others of your kind here?\"\\n\\n He looked at Alex, waiting for answers that did not come.\\n\\n Barrett\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"You would be wise to tell me everything I want to know.\"\\n\\n \"And if I refuse?\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t,\" Barrett replied, his expression smug. \"The woman seems to care for you, and I\u0027m guessing you also care for her. Unfortunately, she has become something of a liability, one I can\u0027t afford to keep around, if you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t just . . . just exterminate her!\" Alex exclaimed, horrified by the casual way the doctor spoke of killing.\\n\\n \"I can. But don\u0027t worry, I promised her it would be quick. However, if you refuse to cooperate with me, I\u0027ll have to renege on that promise.\"\\n\\n \"Let her go, and I\u0027ll tell you whatever you what to know.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t do that. You know as well as I do that she\u0027ll go running to the police the minute she\u0027s free. I can\u0027t allow that.\"\\n\\n \"Bring her to me. I have the power to make her forget everything.\"\\n\\n Interest sparked in the doctor\u0027s eyes. \"What power?\" Barrett paused to check the IV dripping into the alien\u0027s vein. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"She carries my blood. We\u0027re connected. I can control her mind. I can make her forget everything. You, me, everything.\"\\n\\n Barrett shook his head. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\\n\\n \"I can prove it. Tell me something she can\u0027t possibly know, and I\u0027ll plant it in her mind.\" He shuddered convulsively as the sun\u0027s heat scorched his flesh. \"But . . . not . . . now.\"\\n\\n \"Why not now?\"\\n\\n Alex closed his eyes. \"Can\u0027t think. The sun . . .\"\\n\\n Barrett rubbed his jaw, his brow furrowed in thought. If what the alien said was true, there was more at stake here than money or fame. Much more.\\n\\n Going to the door, Barrett called for Kelsey.\\n\\n \"Yeah, Doc?\"\\n\\n \"From now on, I don\u0027t want the alien exposed to the sun for more than a couple of hours in the morning and late afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Why? I thought you said the sun kept him weak.\"\\n\\n Barrett nodded. \"It does, but there\u0027s a chance too much might prove fatal. Let\u0027s cover it from twelve to four and see what happens.\"\\n\\n \"Right. You still want it covered at night?\"\\n\\n \"Definitely. Tomorrow, I want the cover in place by, oh, say eleven. I want to try an experiment tomorrow night, so I\u0027ll need you and Handeland to be here at seven.\"\\n\\n Kelsey glanced at Alex. \"Right. Anything else?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll be in the lab if anyone needs me.\"\\n\\n The tension drained out of Alex as the door closed behind the two men. As near as he could figure, it was a little after ten. That meant another two hours before they covered the skylight.\\n\\n A long, shuddering sigh rippled through his body. Another two hours of feeling the sunlight on his skin, burning his eyes, leeching his strength, until it became an effort to breathe, to think. He comforted himself with the fact that it was only another two hours. He could endure it for that long. He had to endure it, for Kara\u0027s sake.\\n\\n He tried to focus his thoughts on a way to escape. He needed to think, to plan. He had to find a way to get Kara away from this place before it was too late.\\n\\n But try as he might, he couldn\u0027t concentrate, couldn\u0027t think. His skin felt tight, his blood ran hot_hot with pain and rage. Hot with the ancient need to hunt, to destroy his enemies. To taste their blood upon his tongue.\\n\\n Vampire . . .\\n\\n He turned his face toward the wall, troubled by the images the word conjured in his mind. He had written about vampires for years. Perhaps, in some vicarious way, he had been living out his own suppressed desires through the lives of his characters. Perhaps the men of ErAdona would never be free of the innate urge to drink the blood of their enemies.\\n\\n Hands clenched, he stared into the sunlight, hoping its heat would burn the hate and the anger from the depths of his soul.\\n\\n But the pain only fueled his rage. Barrett would pay, he vowed. Pay for the fear and pain he had caused Kara. Pay for the pain that he himself was suffering, for the indignity of being strapped to this metal table. Oh, yes, Barrett would pay!\\n\\n Alex? Alex, can you hear me?\\n\\n Kara\u0027s voice, soft and sweet, filled with concern. It washed over him like cool water, easing his pain, smothering his anger.\\n\\n Alex? Please answer me if you can.\\n\\n I hear you, Kara.\\n\\n Are you all right?\\n\\n He took a deep breath. Yes.\\n\\n I told Barrett the sun was dangerous for you. Has he done anything to protect you from, it?\\n\\n Not yet. Tomorrow . . . tomorrow he wants to do . . . to do some sort of test.\\n\\n A test? What kind of test?\\n\\n Can\u0027t explain now. . . He took a deep breath, his hands clenching and unclenching as he struggled against the thick leather straps that bound his wrists to the table. But he was weak, so damn weak.\\n\\n Alex?\\n\\n So . . . tired. . . try not to worry . . . will get you . . . out of this . . . promise . . .\\n\\n Alex, I love you.\\n\\n Love you . . .Love you, love you. He repeated the words over and over again. It was his last thought before he surrendered to the darkness of oblivion.\\n\\n Shortly before eleven o\u0027clock the next morning, the heavy cover rolled into place, shutting out the sun\u0027s blinding light.\\n\\n Alex sighed with relief, feeling the tension drain out of him as the room grew blessedly dark. The pain in his flesh receded almost immediately. Never before had he been exposed to the direct rays of the sun for such a long period of time. It might take days, perhaps weeks, for his body to regain its full strength.\\n\\n Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath. Perhaps now he would be able to formulate a plan of escape.\\n\\n He was aware of Barrett beside him, fiddling with the IV bottle, and he wondered what drugs the doctor was giving him along with the glucose and saline.\\n\\n He\u0027d been here for three days, Alex thought wearily. Surely the longest three days of his life. In that time, Barrett had drawn copious amounts of blood, taken urine samples, examined Alex from head to foot. This morning, the doctor had cut a small sliver of tissue from the ridged flesh on his back. The pain of the scalpel on the sensitive skin over his spine had been excruciating, and the only thing that had kept him from screaming had been the thought of the revenge that would be his once he\u0027d attained his freedom.\\n\\n \"Remarkable,\" Barrett said. \"Simply remarkable.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s remarkable?\" Kelsey asked.\\n\\n \"The similarities between humans and this alien.\" Barrett laughed with real amusement. \"All these years, Hollywood and the tabloids have imagined aliens as intellectually superior to us, but physically inferior. They\u0027ve always been depicted as diminutive creatures with scrawny arms and legs and huge soulful eyes, when, in reality, their appearance is almost exactly like ours.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, except for that funny looking leathery strip on his back.\"\\n\\n \"Hmmm, yes, that is odd. But that seems to be the only aberration. Two arms, two legs, with the requisite number of fingers and toes. Very humanoid.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I almost forgot. Phillips says he needs more blood.\"\\n\\n \"So soon? What\u0027s he doing with the stuff, drinking it?\" Barrett laughed, amused at his own humor.\\n\\n \"He said ten cc\u0027s would be enough. He\u0027s got two dozen vials ready to go. How much you figure to sell them for?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t decided.\" Barrett readied a syringe, found a vein in the alien\u0027s arm, then watched the syringe fill with blood, noticing again that it was darker and thicker than human blood. \"Each case will be different, depending on income and need.\" He handed the vial to Kelsey. \"Take that to Phillips. And remind Handeland that I want him here at seven tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Has Mitch had any luck finding the old ladies and the girl?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet, but he\u0027s still looking. I\u0027ll drop this off at the lab, and then I\u0027m going to lunch.\"\\n\\n \"Seven,\" Barrett reminded him. \"Don\u0027t be late.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" Kelsey muttered.\\n\\n Barrett grunted as Kelsey left the room. The man was an irritant, but he was loyal, and, like Handeland, he was capable of doing whatever needed to be done.\\n\\n His gaze ran over the alien. He was a remarkable specimen, apparently in his prime, long and lean, with well-muscled arms and legs. A creature from outer space. It was still hard to believe. He shook his head. By this time next year, he\u0027d be a wealthy man. His name would be known throughout the civilized world. His life story would be related in newspapers, magazines, medical journals.\\n\\n He smiled as he imagined himself restoring health and vitality to those who could afford the price of a vial of blood. People would pay whatever he asked to save the life of a loved one stricken with a fatal disease or on the brink of death. But that was only the tip of the iceberg. How much more would people be willing to pay for the promise of immortality? There would have to be tests, of course. Once he had proved that the alien\u0027s blood increased the life span of lab rats, he would have to conduct tests on human subjects. That was the least of his worries. He had no doubt that he would find volunteers by the hundreds, the thousands. People who were sick, dying, would be only too happy to volunteer simply for the chance of being cured of their disease. Testing might take years, but he was a patient man. As soon as he sold the first vials of blood, he would have enough money to do all the research required.\\n\\n He glanced at the alien. They couldn\u0027t keep him strapped to that table forever. They\u0027d have to find a place to house him, some place close at hand so his blood would be readily available, some way to regulate the amount of sunlight he received, a way to keep him docile without inflicting any permanent physical damage.\\n\\n The alien\u0027s eyes opened, and Barrett wondered what the creature was thinking. It was an intelligent species. He would be wise to remember that at all times.\\n\\n Barrett took a deep breath, feeling a surge of power flow through him. Soon, he would have everything he had ever dreamed of: wealth, fame, power, his name in the record books alongside Curie and Salk.\\n\\n Soon, he would have answers to the questions that had plagued scientists for centuries.\\n\\n Soon, he would hold the power of life and death in his hands.\\n\\n Alex waited until Barrett left the room and then, knowing it was futile, he tugged against the straps that imprisoned him. He had to get out of here, had to get Kara out of here before it was too late.\\n\\n He glared at the heavy straps that bound his wrists, at the iron bands that crossed his chest, remembering how Barrett and Kelsey had talked over him as if he were a piece of furniture, as if he couldn\u0027t speak or think. It was humiliating, degrading, to know that Barrett considered him less than human simply because he came from another planet.\\n\\n Insufferable creature! If only he weren\u0027t so weak, he\u0027d rip the leather straps apart, and then he\u0027d rip Barrett and Kelsey to shreds. If only . . .\\n\\n Muttering an oath, he closed his eyes. There was no time for anger or thoughts of revenge, not now. It was time to rest, to gather his strength for the battle to come. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-25.html","bookId":2308,"book":{"id":2308,"title":"Deeper than the Night","description":"Storyline: Townsfolk of Moulton Bay said there was something otherworldly about Alexander Claybourne.
