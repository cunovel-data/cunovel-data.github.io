{"id":95460,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"What do you mean, I can\u0027t go home?\" Kara stared at Alexander, her brow furrowed. \"Just what I said,\" Alexander replied calmly. \"You must realize it isn\u0027t safe.\" \"Not safe?\" Kara shook her head, completely bewildered. \"Barrett\u0027s up to something, Kara. I don\u0027t know what, but I don\u0027t trust him, and you shouldn\u0027t either. Barrett was holding you against your will. They refused to let your grandmother see you.\" Kara shook her head, refusing to believe a reputable doctor would be up to something sinister. \"I want to take you away from here.\" \"Away?\" Kara stopped pacing. Standing by the window, she turned to face Alexander. \"No, I can\u0027t leave Nana, or Gail.\" \"I don\u0027t think you have any choice.\" \"Dammit, Alexander, you\u0027re scaring me!\" \"You should be scared. There\u0027s something not right here, and until I know what it is, I don\u0027t want you going home.\" Maybe he was right. Maybe she shouldn\u0027t go home right away. She slid a furtive glance in his direction. She couldn\u0027t deny the attraction she felt for Alex, couldn\u0027t refute the feelings of her own heart, but what did she know about him, really? Nothing. Not one darn thing. And he expected her to go away with him. The thought held a certain appeal, and yet, for all she knew, he could be working with Barrett. \"You can trust me, Kara.\" Kara took a step backward. Was he reading her mind? But no, such a thing was impossible. Wasn\u0027t it? \"How do you know what I was thinking?\" she demanded. Alexander shrugged. It took less than no effort at all to read her mind, but he couldn\u0027t tell her that. \"It\u0027s a logical assumption. You have no reason to trust me. In your place, I would feel the same.\" She looked skeptical, and more than a little fearful. \"I won\u0027t hurt you, Kara. You must believe that.\" Alexander ran a hand through his hair. He had to take her away from here. No doubt Barrett was searching for her even now. If what Alex suspected was true, an unscrupulous man could make millions by selling vials of Kara\u0027s blood to the sick, the dying. And if they should discover who he was, what he was . . . Alex didn\u0027t even want to think of the consequences. He would be questioned, examined, kept in a cage while they harvested his blood. All these years, Alexander mused. He had lived here two hundred years and never known about the miraculous change that had been wrought in his blood. His inherent powers had multiplied, but he had never suspected that the healing power in his blood could be transferred to another, or that he had the ability to heal the sick as he was able to heal himself. Even when he had given Kara his blood, he hadn\u0027t been certain of the outcome. He felt Kara staring at him. With an effort, he wipedhis face clean of expression. \"I\u0027ve got to go home, Alexander. I can\u0027t just disappear without letting Nana and Gail know where I am.\" \"Right now, I think they\u0027re better off not knowing.\" \"Where do you want to go?\" \"I have a place up in Eagle Flats. You\u0027ll be safe there.\" \"Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, won\u0027t your life be in danger, too, if you\u0027re with me?\" \"I don\u0027t think your life is in danger, Kara. Only your freedom.\" \"I wish I knew what this was all about.\" \"They didn\u0027t tell you anything?\" \"Not really. Only that there was some abnormality in my blood, and they were afraid it might be contagious, or toxic. They said they\u0027d have to keep me in isolation until they discovered what the problem was.\" She let out a long sigh of exasperation. \"They said they had checked all the blood donors, and all of them were normal.\" Alexander grunted softly, waiting for her to make the connection, to ask the questions he couldn\u0027t answer. Kara stared at Alex for a long moment, her mind racing. And then she knew, knew without a doubt. \"It\u0027s your blood,\" she said flatly. \"It\u0027s your blood that\u0027s caused all this trouble, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s why you were so interested in my recovery, why you kept coming to see me. You wanted to make sure I was all right.\" \"Kara . . .\" \"It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it? Your blood is tainted, or . . . or something.\" \"I assure you, my blood is quite normal.\" It wasn\u0027t a lie, he thought ruefully. His blood was normal. For him. \"I don\u0027t believe you. You\u0027re hiding something. I know you are.\" She stood frozen in place, her eyes blinking rapidly, her heart pounding even as her mind refused to accept what she was thinking. Good Lord, Gail was right! The thought that Alexander was a vampire was inconceivable, and yet it was the only thing that made sense. She had never seen him during the day. She had never seen him eat . . . A faint smile curved Alexander\u0027s lips as he perceived her thoughts. He wasn\u0027t a vampire. Not in the true sense of the word, but he decided that was information best kept to himself. At least for the time being. \"Kara . . .\" Alexander held out his hands in a gesture of appeal. \"Kara, I assure you, I\u0027m not a vampire.\u0027\" \"You\u0027re doing it again!\" she exclaimed. \"Doing what?\" \"Reading my mind. How do you do that?\" Alex shook his head in denial. He would have to be more careful. \"We talked about this once before, I think. After all, Gail came here looking for a vampire. It\u0027s only natural that the thought should linger in your mind. I\u0027ve had the feeling ever since then that you thought she might be right. Come, I want to show you something.\" She hesitated a moment, then followed him out of the den and into the kitchen, wondering what he wanted to show her. \"Look, Kara.\" He pointed at the window opposite him. \"Look.\" Confused, she glanced at their reflections in the window. \"Vampires cast no reflection, no shadow.\" He crossed the floor to the counter, picked up a banana. Peeled it. And took a bite. \"They don\u0027t eat.\" \"But your cupboards are empty; you don\u0027t have any soap to wash dishes . . .\" \"I don\u0027t cook.\" He tossed what was left of the banana into the trash. \"I don\u0027t like to eat alone. When I get hungry, I go out.\" He shook his head at the doubtful expression on her face. \"Will you feel better if I take you out to dinner on our way to Eagle Flats?\" \"Maybe.\" \"You don\u0027t have to be afraid of me, Kara,\" he said quietly. \"I won\u0027t hurt you.\" She felt suddenly foolish. \"Okay, so it was stupid of me to think you were a vampire. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve been so worried, so . . . so upset by everything that\u0027s happened.\" \"I know.\" He moved slowly toward her and held out his arms in silent invitation. She hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, and then she stepped into his embrace, sighing as his arms closed around her. He stroked her hair. \"You\u0027ll come away with me, then?\" \"Do I have a choice?\" \"Not really.\" \"Why do I have the feeling that you\u0027ll truss me up and toss me in the trunk of your car if I say no?\" \"Probably because that\u0027s just what I\u0027ll do.\" She wasn\u0027t altogether sure he was kidding. \"I think we should leave tonight.\" She didn\u0027t want to go; she was afraid to stay. In the end, it was easier to give in. \"Tonight!\" She glanced at the jeans and sweatshirt Alexander had given her earlier. \"I can\u0027t leave tonight. I need to go home and pack . . .\" The words died in her throat. She couldn\u0027t go home. \"We\u0027ll buy whatever you need on the way.\" \"Where\u0027s my cell phone? I want to call Nana.\" Alex shook his head. \"Not now.\" She stared at him in mutinous silence, but didn\u0027t argue. Calls could be traced. He was relieved that she had decided to see things his way. \"Just let me get a few of my things together, and we\u0027ll go.\" Kara wandered through the house, trying to make some sense of what had happened, while Alexander packed. If none of the blood donors were at fault, maybe the problem was hers, and hers alone. Maybe her blood had always been abnormal and no one had ever detected it before. And maybe it was Alexander\u0027s blood that was at the root of whatever the problem was, and he was just afraid to tell her. Going into the den, she sat down in his chair and closed her eyes. Maybe it hadn\u0027t been a blood donor at fault at all. Maybe Dr. Peterson had given her the wrong blood. Maybe the hospital had made some kind of mistake, and Barrett had kept her in isolation in hopes of correcting the problem before anyone else found out about it. Kara smiled grimly. That made far more sense than anything else. \"How long will it take to get to your place?\" \"We should be there by tomorrow night.\" \"I\u0027ve never been up to Eagle Flats. I hear it\u0027s pretty.\" \"Yes.\" Kara stared out the restaurant window. They had left Moulton Bay three hours ago, and her apprehension about running away had increased with every mile that passed. Gail and Nana must be worried sick. She had to call home, had to tell them she was all right. When the waitress arrived, Kara ordered a Caesar salad and a glass of 7-Up, then excused herself to go to the rest room. Heart pounding, she stepped into the phone booth near the rest rooms and dialed the operator. Moments later, Gail answered the phone. Kara\u0027s fingers tapped nervously on the wall asshe waited for Gail to say she would accept the charges. \"Gail, I don\u0027t have time to talk or explain. I just want you to know I\u0027m okay. Tell Nana not to worry.\" \"Kara, where are you? Two men from the hospital came here looking for you. They said you\u0027ve got some contagious disease.\" \"It isn\u0027t true, honey, don\u0027t worry. Listen, I\u0027ve got to go. I\u0027ll call you again as soon as I get a chance. \" \"Kara . . .\" \"I love you, Gail. Bye.\" Kara hung up the phone, then pressed her forehead against the wall. Men were looking for her. Maybe she really was sick. Maybe just being out in public was putting innocent lives in danger . . . . \"Kara.\" Startled by his voice, she turned around. \"You called home, didn\u0027t you?\" She felt a shiver of trepidation at the accusation in his eyes. \"I had to.\" \"It was a stupid thing to do.\" She started to argue, then changed her mind. He was right. It had been stupid. Whoever was looking for her might have managed to bug Nana\u0027s phone. Perhaps, even now, Dale Barrett or someone like him was speeding down the highway toward the restaurant. \"You\u0027re right, it was stupid. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"We\u0027d better go.\" \"But . . . what about our food?\" \"We\u0027ll get something on the road.\" Alexander left some money on the table and they left the restaurant. Kara sat huddled in her seat as Alex turned the key in the ignition. The engine hummed to life and Alex pulled out of the parking lot. Kara glanced over her shoulder, her gaze sweeping the parking lot and the road behind them. Were they being followed, even now? Why hadn\u0027t she listened to Alex? Why was she with Alex? Maybe he was in on it. Maybe she\u0027d jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire . . . . She slid a glance in his direction. He was staring straight ahead, watching the road, but she had the distinct impression that he knew her every thought. How could she keep him from reading her mind? If she wanted to get away from him, how could she do it if he knew what shewas thinking, feeling? Forty-five minutes later, he pulled into a McDonald\u0027s drive-through and ordered burgers and fries and two large cups of coffee. She couldn\u0027t stifle a feeling of relief when she saw Alex bite into the hamburger. After all, one bite of a banana didn\u0027t really prove anything, and no matter what she\u0027d said to the contrary, she hadn\u0027t been able to shake the feeling that there was something inhuman about Alexander Claybourne. Now, watching him eat something as mundane as a Big Mac and fries made her realize how ludicrous such thoughts had been. The darkness and the motion of the car made her sleepy. Leaning her head back against the seat, she closed her eyes. Kara came awake slowly. Keeping her eyes closed, she turned over, thinking she\u0027d just sleep for another ten minutes, and then she\u0027d get up and go to work . . . . And then she remembered. She wasn\u0027t going to work today, perhaps not for a long time. With a start, her eyelids flew open and she found herself staring into Alexander\u0027s face, which was only inches from her own. He was lying on his side, asleep. In her bed. She glanced around the room. A motel, obviously, judging from the ugly picture bolted to the wall and the pay TV. She peeked under the covers, felt her cheeks grow hot when she saw that she wore only her bra and underpants. He\u0027d undressed her while she slept. Her gaze flew back to Alex\u0027s face. He was still sleeping. It wasn\u0027t right for a man to be so beautiful, she thought. His lips were full and perfect. His nose was straight. His lashes were thick and dark. His skin was an even brown, as though he spent a great deal of time in the sun, yet she had never seen him in daylight . . . . He couldn\u0027t be a vampire! It was ludicrous to even think such a thing. He was, however, very much a man. A very attractive and desirable man. The thought of being in bed with him when he woke up was something she didn\u0027t even want to consider. Moving as carefully as possible, she eased over to her side of the mattress and sat up. Looking at her watch, she saw that it was almost four. She\u0027d never slept so late in her life. Grabbing her clothes from the chair, she went into the bathroom to take a shower. Alex groaned softly as the bathroom door closed behind Kara. He had slept at her side through what had been left of the night and all day long, aware of every move she made. Several times, she had brushed against him; once, she had cuddled up to him. Not even the fact that he had slept in his jeans had kept his body from reacting to her nearness, to the brush of her thigh against his leg, the touch of her hand on his bare chest. He had not been with a woman he cared for in more years than he cared to recall, and the need that had surged through him had been excruciating. It was not common for those of his kind to go so long without sexual gratification. Kara\u0027s nearness, added to the fact that he was becoming increasingly fond of her, had fueled his desire. The fact that she was beautiful, inside and out, and less than a breath away, had been sheer torture. A torment he could have easily escaped by sleeping on the chair, or on the floor, yet he had been powerless to resist the opportunity to be near her. He felt his desire spring to life anew when he heard the shower. The thoughts and images running rampant through his mind shamed him, yet he could not help but imagine how she looked standing under the water . . . . With an oath, he threw the covers aside and got out of bed. There was a carafe of hot water and some packets of instant coffee on the table in front of the window and he quickly made a cup, then drank it down, cursing softly as the hot liquid burned his tongue. Served him right, he thought irritably. Pulling back the heavy curtains, he glanced outside. The sky was heavily overcast and promised rain before the day was out. He was standing at the window, staring out into the parking lot, when he heard the bathroom door open. Taking a deep breath, he counted to ten, then turned around. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Kara said, \"I didn\u0027t mean to wake you.\" \"You didn\u0027t. There\u0027s coffee on the table.\" Kara nodded, wondering why he seemed so tense. \"I\u0027m going to take a shower, then we\u0027ll go. We\u0027ll get something to eat on the road.\" \"All right.\" She went to fix herself a cup of coffee, acutely conscious of Alex moving about behind her as he pulled clean clothes from the duffel bag he had packed the night before. She heard the bathroom door shut, and she let out the breath she\u0027d been holding. It was close to six that evening when they left the motel. The tension between them seemed to grow as the night went on. After they left the motel, they had stopped at a roadside restaurant for dinner, and again at a strip mall so she could buy some clothes. Since she had no money with her and didn\u0027t want to be indebted to Alex for more than was absolutely necessary, Kara had selected only a few essential items, but Alex had insisted she buy several dresses, as well as slacks and sweaters, shoes, socks, a nightgown, robe and slippers, as well as toiletries. She had promised to pay him back, but he had dismissed her offer with a wave of his hand. \"I don\u0027t need your money, Kara,\" he had said quietly. The words What do you need? had risen in her throat, but she had choked them back, afraid of what his answer might be.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-13.html","bookId":2308,"book":{"id":2308,"title":"Deeper than the Night","description":"Storyline: Townsfolk of Moulton Bay said there was something otherworldly about Alexander Claybourne.
