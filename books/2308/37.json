It didn\u0027t seem possible her little sister was graduating from high school. In the fall, Gail was going to college to study anthropology, parapsychology, and astronomy.\\n\\n Hard as it was to think of Gail as a young woman, it was even harder to believe that her brother, Steve, had finally shaken the wanderlust out of his system and settled down. He had gotten married three years ago to a lovely girl he\u0027d met in South America, and they were expecting their first child in December.\\n\\n Kara glanced down the row of seats. All the people she loved best were here tonight. There were tears in Nana\u0027s eyes as Gail accepted her diploma; Elsie Zimmermann was beaming with pride.\\n\\n Looking farther down the row, she saw Alex. He was sitting in the aisle seat, looking as handsome as ever.\\n\\n He met her gaze and winked at her. I love you.\\n\\n She felt a smile tug at her lips. And I love you.\\n\\n It still amazed her that she was married to such an incredible man. So much had happened in the last eight years. His books, now written under his own name, were consistently on the top of the New York Times Best Seller list. Their family was growing.\\n\\n She smiled at her three children. They were all beautiful, all perfect, from their firstborn son, Alexander, now seven, to their youngest daughter, age two.\\n\\n Kara rested her hand on her swollen belly. Their fourth child was due in another seven weeks. Their son was hoping for another boy to even things out.\\n\\n All Alex\u0027s fears had been groundless. Alexander hadbeen born with a minimum of pain and fuss, as had their two daughters, Lena and Katy Jay. The only hint of their alien heritage was the pale brown stripe that darkened their spines. The doctors had said it was nothing to worry about, just a peculiar sort of birthmark that would no doubt fade in time.\\n\\n As for herself, she had suffered no ill effects from receiving Alexander\u0027s blood. Quite the opposite. In the last eight years, she hadn\u0027t aged at all. As for their children, they had all been blessed with remarkable good health. None of them had been sick a day in their lives. Alex had told her that ErAdonian children grew to maturity normally, and then theaging process slowed. It remained to be seen what long-term effect their union would have on their children.\\n\\n She knew they would have to leave Moulton Bay soon, before people began to wonder why the Claybournes didn\u0027t seem to get any older. It would be hard to leave this place, but she really didn\u0027t mind. As much as she loved Alex\u0027s house, it was, after all, just a house. He was her home, her life, and she would willingly follow him across the country, or across the world.\\n\\n The graduation ended and she stood up, applauding with every one else.\\n\\n And then Alex was beside her, one armsliding around her shoulders, his dark eyes warm with love as he placed a hand over her abdomen. \"You feelin\u0027 okay?\"\\n\\n \"Fine. Are you ready to go home?\"\\n\\n \"Whenever you are.\"\\n\\n \"Just let me give Gail her present. She\u0027s going to an all-night party with Cherise and Stephanie.\"\\n\\n Alex nodded, and then winked at her. \"Steve and Maria said they\u0027d watch the kids for us.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n He patted her stomach gently, felt his child give a lusty kick. \"I decided if I wanted to spend any time alone with you, I\u0027d better do it soon,\" he said, kissing her on the cheek, \"so I\u0027ve planned a little party of my own. And you\u0027re the guest of honor.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go, then,\" Kara said, grinning up at him. \"I\u0027m starting to feel hungry.\"\\n\\n Alex laughed softly as he bent to kiss her again. \"Me, too, natayah,\" he whispered huskily. \"And after I\u0027ve satisfied your hunger, we\u0027ll get something to eat.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-37.html","bookId":2308,"book":{"id":2308,"title":"Deeper than the Night","description":"Storyline: Townsfolk of Moulton Bay said there was something otherworldly about Alexander Claybourne. Some people whispered that with his dark, arresting features and mesmerising eyes, the seductive stranger looked every inch a vampire. They never guessed how near the truth they were-or that after more than two hundred years of resisting temptation, Claybourne had found a woman he had to possess. \\n Never one to be scared off by superstitious lore, Kara Crawford laughed at the local talk of creatures lurking in the dark. What harm could come of befriending the handsome stranger with the haunted look in his midnight eyes? No matter what shadowy secrets Alexander hid, Kara felt drawn to him, compelled to join him beneath the silver light of the moon, where they would share a love...\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/deeper-than-the-night.jpg","author":"Amanda Ashley","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:01 PM"}}
