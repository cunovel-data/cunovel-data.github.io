{"id":95468,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"They drove down the mountain at dusk. Kara could hardly sit still, so anxious was she at the prospect of calling home. They pulled into the first gas station they saw to make the call. Kara fidgeted nervously while she dialed the number. The phone seemed to ring forever. \"She doesn\u0027t answer,\" Kara said, hanging up the receiver. \"We\u0027ll try again tomorrow night.\" \"No. I want to call home. I have to get in touch with Gail.\" \"Kara, we talked about that before. It might not be safe.\" \"I don\u0027t care! I have to call home, Alex. I have a feeling something\u0027s wrong.\" He studied her face for a moment, then sighed in resignation. \"I\u0027ll make the call. No one will recognize my voice.\" Kara nodded in agreement. Dialing quickly, she thrust the receiver into his hand. The phone rang three times, then a female voice Alex didn\u0027t recognize answered the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hello. May I speak to Kara, please?\" \"I\u0027m sorry, she\u0027s not here. May I takea message?\" \"Is Gail there?\" \"Yes. May I ask who\u0027s calling?\" \"I\u0027m a friend of Kara\u0027s.\" \"Oh?\" There was a world of curiosity in the word. \"May I speak to Gail, please?\" \"Who should I say is calling?\" Alex grimaced. \"Who am I speaking to?\" \"This is Mrs. Zimmermann.\" Alex held the receiver out to Kara. \"The neighbor lady\u0027s on the phone.\" Kara\u0027s hand was shaking as she lifted the receiver to her ear. Something was wrong. She knew it. \"Mrs. Zimmermann?\" \"Kara, is that you?\" \"Yes. Is everything all right?\" \"I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news, dear. Your . . . your grandmother . . . she\u0027s, I mean, ah, she\u0027s in the hospital.\" \"The hospital! What happened?\" \"She collapsed at the grocery store.\" \"Collapsed! Is she all right? When did it happen?\" \"It happened day before yesterday,\" Mrs. Zimmermann said, sounding flustered. \"At first they thought it was a heart attack, but they\u0027ve ruled that out.\" \"Where\u0027s Gail?\" \"She\u0027s here. Hold on, I\u0027ll get her.\" Moments later, Gail\u0027s voice came over the phone. \"Kara, Kara, where are you? When are you coming home?\" \"As soon as I can, sweetie. How\u0027s Nana?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Dr. Petersen said it was caused by stress. They\u0027re giving her some kind of medicine. I don\u0027t know what it is.\" Gail sniffed loudly. \"He said she\u0027ll probably be all right. But what if she isn\u0027t?\" \"Gail, has Barrett been around?\" \"Every day. And he\u0027s not alone. There\u0027s two guys with him. They look like_like crooks.\" \"What hospital is Nana in?\" \"The one here in town. Dr. Barrett suggested moving her to Grenvale for some kind of test. He says they have better facilities there.\" \"Tell Nana to stay where she is, Gail. Tell her to insist she wants Dr. Petersen to look after her. Is Mrs. Zimmermann staying with you?\" \"Yes. I\u0027m scared, Kara. Please come home.\" \"I will. Have you called Steve?\" \"I tried, but he\u0027s out in the jungle somewhere and they can\u0027t get hold of him.\" \"All right. Don\u0027t tell anyone I called. I\u0027ve got to go now, Gail. Try not to worry. I\u0027ll be home as soon as I can.\" \"All right. Bye.\" Kara hung up the receiver and turned away from the phone. \"Oh, Alex, Nana\u0027s . . .\" \"I know,\" he said, drawing her into his arms. \"I heard.\" \"I\u0027ve got to go home.\" \"I can\u0027t let you do that. You heard what Gail said. Barrett\u0027s been there every day.\" \"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ve got to see Nana.\" She looked up at Alex, hope shining through her tears. \"You can help her, can\u0027t you, the way you helped me? She\u0027ll get better if you give her some of your blood. I know she will. Please, Alex, I can\u0027t let her die.\" \"Kara . . .\" His hands knotted into fists. What she was asking was impossible. He hadn\u0027t managed to survive here for two hundred years by taking chances. His life span might have increased drastically, but he wasn\u0027t truly immortal. He was subject to pain and death just like any other living creature. \"As much as I\u0027d like to, I can\u0027t do what you want.\" \"Why not?\" \"I can\u0027t.\" \"Very well, then, I\u0027ll go alone.\" \"Dammit, Kara, I understand how you feel, but I can\u0027t let you go home. I won\u0027t let you put your life in jeopardy.\" \"If you won\u0027t go with me, then I\u0027ll go alone. But I am going! Nana\u0027s taken care of me since I was fourteen. I can\u0027t desert her now, when she needs me most. I can\u0027t, and I won\u0027t.\" She stared at Alex through her tears, feeling as though he had betrayed her. She hadcounted on him to help her, and he\u0027d let her down. \"If you won\u0027t give her any of your blood, then I\u0027ll give her some of mine. Maybe it will work just as well as yours, but even if it doesn\u0027t, I\u0027ve got to go. I\u0027ve got to try.\" Alex stared at the tears shining in her eyes, at the stubborn tilt of her head, and knew he couldn\u0027t let her face Barrett alone. \"Your blood would work just fine, Kara.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Just what I said.\" Alex took a deep breath. It was time she knew the truth. In a voice devoid of emotion, he told her the whole truth about the rat and how he had tested her blood, as well as his own. Both had restored the rodent\u0027s health, though his own blood, unmixed and undiluted, had worked more quickly. \"Whydidn\u0027t you tell me this before?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Kara shook her head. \"It\u0027s not possible.\" \"It\u0027s very possible. It appears your blood now contains the same healing agent as mine, whatever that might be. That\u0027s why Barrett needs you. I think he wants to try and isolate whatever it is that generates the healing. Don\u0027t you see? If he can mass produce it, he\u0027ll be a millionaire many times over. And if he can\u0027t . . .\" \"And if he can\u0027t, he\u0027ll just take my blood a little at a time and sell it to the highest bidder.\" Alex nodded. Kara shuddered. It was a frightening thought. For a moment, she imagined herself kept in a cage, well-fed and well-cared for, but a prisoner nonetheless, kept in isolation while Barrett siphoned off her blood, selling it a little at a time while he tried to find a way to reproduce it. \"It\u0027s a frightening thing to consider, isn\u0027t it?\" Alex asked quietly. \"Yes.\" She understood now why he had kept to himself, why he had never let anyone know what he was. \"Now do you understand why I can\u0027t let you go home?\" \"I have to go, Alex. I have to help Nana if I can. Please try to understand.\" Short of locking her up inside the mountain, there was no way to stop her. \"All right, Kara,\" Alex said heavily, \"I\u0027ll take you home.\" She collapsed against him, her shoulders heaving as sobs wracked her body. \"Don\u0027t cry, natayah,\" he murmured. \"Please don\u0027t cry. You shall go home.\" \"Thank you, Alex.\" He nodded. \"We\u0027ll leave tomorrow as soon as it\u0027s dark.\" Holding her away from him, he wiped away her tears with his fingertips; then, taking her hand in his, they walked back to the car. Gail\u0027s footsteps were heavy as she walked home from school. She had called the hospital last night after she\u0027d talked to Kara. The nurse had assured her that Nana was resting comfortably. Turning down the street toward her house, she wondered when Kara would get home, and where she\u0027d been for the last five weeks. She frowned when she saw the dark blue car parked in the driveway. Barrett again. He came by every day to ask if Kara had called. She wasn\u0027t sure, but she thought she\u0027d seen that same car following her to and from school. Gail muttered a nasty word. She didn\u0027t like Barrett, even though he\u0027d never said or done anything to earn her dislike. She didn\u0027t like him and she didn\u0027t trust him any more than she trusted those two men who were always with him. Their names were Kelsey and Handeland. Barrett said they were his associates. She wasn\u0027t sure what that meant, but she didn\u0027t like the sound ofit at all. The two men were always wandering through the house, looking in the closets, poking into drawers, rummaging through Nana\u0027s desk. Several times a day, they walked through the neighborhood. She knew they were looking for Kara. Barrett was sitting on the sofa, talking to Mrs. Zimmermann, when Gail entered the house. She didn\u0027t see his associates, so she assumed they were outside, prowling around the neighborhood. \"Ah, Gail,\" he said. \"There you are.\" \"Hello.\" He smiled at her, ignoring her sullen expression. \"Still no word from Kara?\" \"No.\" He nodded slowly. \"I hope she calls soon. Every day without treatment only decreases your sister\u0027s chances of a full recovery.\" \"What does she need to recover from?\" \"As I told you before, we found a gross abnormality in her red blood cells. I\u0027m afraid it may prove fatal.\" He shook his head. \"Her condition could also prove to be contagious.\" He smiled his oily smile. \"If you come into contact with her, you might also be at risk.\" His gaze bored into hers. \"Are you sure she hasn\u0027t called home?\" \"I\u0027m sure.\" Gail held his gaze as long as she could, wondering if he knew she was lying. Suddenly nervous, she glanced at Mrs. Zimmermann, at the floor, out the window. \"I\u0027ve got to go now. I\u0027ve got homework.\" \"You\u0027re lying, aren\u0027t you, Gail? She called last night, didn\u0027t she?\" Gail shook her head. \"No.\" Barrett slammed his fist on the coffee table. He had spent the last week finding a suitable place for a lab, had spent a good portion of his life savings setting it up. He swore under his breath. He had waited years for a break like this, had devoted countless hours to research, hoping to find a way to extend the human life span, and now, when he finally had what might be the answer to years of research, they couldn\u0027t find the damn woman. Every day wasted meant lives lost that might have been saved. \"I\u0027m tired of this!\" he exclaimed. \"Tired of waiting!\" Rising, he crossed the room and grabbed Gail by the arm. \"Tell me the truth, dammit!\" \"I am! Honest!\" She stared up at him, frightened by the fury in his eyes. \"You\u0027re hurting me.\" \"Stop that,\" Mrs. Zimmermann cried. Jumping to her feet, she took hold of Barrett\u0027s hand and tried to pull him away from Gail. \"Leave her alone!\" Barrett shook Mrs. Zimmermann off. \"Talk tome, Gail. I don\u0027t want to hurt you, but I\u0027ve been patient long enough. Where is she?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" She was crying now. \"I\u0027m going to call the police,\" Mrs. Zimmermann said. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Barrett\u0027s voice, cold as ice, stopped her in her tracks. \"Pick up that phone, and I\u0027ll break the kid\u0027s arm.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t!\" Mrs. Zimmermann stared at Barrett, her face pale, her expression one of stunned horror. \"You . . . you\u0027re a doctor.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" A cruel smile twisted Barrett\u0027s lips. \"After I break her arm, I can set it. Now tell me what I want to know!\" \"Don\u0027t tell him anything,\" Gail said, sobbing. \"I\u0027m . . . I\u0027m not afraid.\" She cried out as Barrett twisted her arm behind her back. \"Aren\u0027t you?\" he asked. Elsie Zimmermann\u0027s face paled as Barrett\u0027s gaze pierced hers. \"Kara . . . she . . . she called last night.\" \"Mrs. Zimmermann, don\u0027t!\" \"Shut up, kid.\" Barrett gave Gail\u0027s arm a sharp twist. \"Go on, Elsie, what\u0027d she say?\" \"Not much. She just called to see how everyone was.\" Mrs. Zimmermann clasped her hands to her breasts. \"I told her Lena was in the hospital.\" \"Did she say she was coming home?\" \"No.\" Elsie Zimmermann shook her head. \"I told you what you wanted to know. Now, unhand Gail.\" Barrett grunted softly. \"You must have talked to her, too, kid. What\u0027d she say?\" \"Nothing. She just said I shouldn\u0027t worry.\" \"But she\u0027s coming home, right?\" \"No. She knows you\u0027re here. I told her you came by every day.\" Gail smiled smugly. \"Kara\u0027s too smart to come home.\" \"Yeah? Well, we\u0027ll see about that.\" He gave Gail a shove toward the sofa. \"Sit down, kid. You, too, Elsie.\" He patted his coat pocket. \"I\u0027ve got to make a couple of phone calls, and I want you two to sit there and be quiet. Understand?\" Mrs. Zimmermann nodded. \"I\u0027m sorry, dear,\" she whispered, wrapping her arms protectively around the girl. \"So sorry.\" Gail nodded, praying that Kara really was too smart to come home. Alex drove past Kara\u0027s house twice, all his senses alert, everynerve in his body warning him of danger. They had gone to the hospital first only to discover that Kara\u0027s grandmother had been transferred to another hospital at her doctor\u0027s request. \"Transferred?\" Kara asked. \"Yes,\" the nurse had said, checking Lena Corley\u0027s file. \"Dr. Barrett from Grenvale General is now in charge of your grandmother\u0027s care.\" A sudden coldness settled in the pit of Kara\u0027s stomach. \"Do you have a number where I can reach him?\" \"Yes, right here,\" the nurse said. \"I\u0027ll write it down for you.\" Kara stared at the paper the nurse handed her. The phone number was her own. \"He\u0027s got her,\" Kara said as they left the hospital. \"Barrett\u0027s got my grandmother.\" \"So itwould seem.\" Alex drove by the house a third time, then parked the car at the end of the block and turned to face Kara. \"Something\u0027s not right in there. You stay here while I go check it out.\" \"What if Barrett\u0027s there?\" \"I\u0027m sure he is. But he doesn\u0027t know me.\" \"You\u0027ll be careful?\" Alex nodded. \"If I\u0027m gone more than ten minutes, you go back up the mountain and wait for me. If I\u0027m not there by tomorrow night, try to get in touch with your brother.\" \"I\u0027m not leaving you.\" \"Dammit, Kara, don\u0027t be a fool. You won\u0027t do your grandmother or Gail any good if you\u0027re locked up in some lab. Even if it takes a year for Barrett to give up, at least you\u0027ll still have your freedom.\" \"We\u0027re wasting time.\" \"Promise me you\u0027ll leave if I\u0027m not back in ten minutes,\" Alex said. \"Promise me, or we\u0027re going back, now, even if I have to tie you up and carry you.\" \"Oh, all right, I promise.\" \"I expect you to keep it.\" \"Be careful.\" \"I will.\" He gazed at her for a long moment; then, grasping her by the shoulders, he drew her close and kissed her, hard. \"Remember your promise,\" he said, and slid out of the car. His sense of danger grew stronger as he approached the house. Standing on the porch, he let his senses expand. There were a number of people inside. He recognized Gail\u0027s scent among them. Taking a deep breath, he knocked on the door.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-21.html","bookId":2308,"book":{"id":2308,"title":"Deeper than the Night","description":"Storyline: Townsfolk of Moulton Bay said there was something otherworldly about Alexander Claybourne.
