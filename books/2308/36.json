When they were in the car, the laughter she\u0027d been holding back bubbled up. She laughed until her sides ached, until there were tears in her eyes. \"That was wonderful,\" she said, gasping for air. \"If I hadn\u0027t seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.\" Alex grinned at her as he pulled away from the curb. Rolling down the window, he took a deep breath. For the first time in months, he felt that everything would work out after all. \"You weren\u0027t kidding before, when you said you could make me forget you, were you?\" \"No.\" \"A handy trick.\" Alex nodded. He had given Barrett and Jarvis just enough blood to create a mind link between them, and then he had invaded their thoughts and erased all memory of himself and Kara from their minds. It had left him feeling weak and on the brink of exhaustion, but it had been worth it. While he rested in Barrett\u0027s office, Kara had gone through the lab to make sure Hamblin had destroyed the last blood sample Barrett had taken and anything else that related to Barrett\u0027s work, or to the two of them. When Barrett and his henchman woke up, they wouldn\u0027t remember anything. Kara slid a glance in Alex\u0027s direction. \"You share a mind link with them now, don\u0027t you?\" Alex nodded. If he was so inclined, he would be able to communicate telepathically with Barrett and Jarvis. He doubted he would ever feel the need. \"Are they going to have increased life spans?\" Alex shrugged. \"No doubt they\u0027ll enjoy remarkably good health. As for longer lives, only time will tell.\" \"What about me?\" \"I gave you considerably more blood than I gave either of them. I would say there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll live a long and healthy life.\" Kara stared into the distance, trying to absorb what that might mean, wondering if she\u0027d live as long as Alex, wondering what it would be like to stay young and healthy for another hundred years. \"Kara, are you all right?\" \"Yes. I was just wondering what our next move is going to be.\" \"We need to find a place to spend what\u0027s left of the night. Tomorrow, you can call your grandmother and Gail and tell them it\u0027s safe for them to go home. We can pick them up tomorrow night, if you want.\" \"Home,\" Kara said, caressing the word. \"I can go back to my apartment.\" She smiled, her eyes glowing. Alex nodded, wondering if she meant to go back to her old life now that the danger was past. Not that he could blame her. She was a vibrant young woman. Now that the danger was past, she was probably regretting her marriage to a man who lived in the shadows, who couldn\u0027t share the sunlight. His fingers clenched around the steering wheel. If she wanted to be free of him, he would let her go, even though he knew it would kill him to do so. It was near dawn when they found a motel. Kara waited in the car while Alex got a room. Inside, she sat on the bed, wondering at Alex\u0027s abrupt change of mood. He\u0027d been jubilant a short while ago; now he looked morose, as if he had just lost his best friend. \"Are you all right?\" she asked. He nodded. \"Just tired. I\u0027m going to bed.\" \"I\u0027m hungry,\" Kara said. \"I think I\u0027ll go see if I can find something to eat.\" She smiled at him. \"I don\u0027t guess you want anything.\" \"No.\" \"Ill be right back.\" He nodded, wondering if she would come back. If he hadn\u0027t been so utterly weary, he would have probed her thoughts, but he lacked the energy. She kissed him on the cheek, grabbed the car keys from the dresser and left the room, thinking as she did so that they would have to return Barrett\u0027s car once they picked hers up from Eagle Flats. Lying back on the bed, Alex stared at the drapes. It would be morning soon, and he\u0027d be trapped in this room until the sun went down. On their wedding night, he had been so certain of her love, but now the doubts of two hundred years plagued him. Why would she want to spend her life with him? He was an alien. He couldn\u0027t stay in one place more than ten or fifteen years. He\u0027d never be able to take their child on outings to the beach or the zoo or the park or do a hundred other things that a human male could do. How long would it take before she grew tired of the way he lived, before she started wishing she had never married him at all? With a low groan, he covered his eyes with his arm. Life would have no meaning without Kara. If she left him now, he\u0027d have no reason to go on living. Kara, please don\u0027t leave me . . . She was standing at the cash register, paying for a hamburger with the works, onion rings, and a chocolate shake to go, when Alex\u0027s voice sounded in her mind. Kara, please don\u0027t leave me . . . . The anguish in his voice was like a knife in her heart. Collecting her change, she hurried out to the car. Placing her order on the passenger seat, she drove back to the motel as fast as she dared. The depths of Alexander\u0027s grief brought tears to her eyes even as she wondered why he thought she was leaving him. I\u0027m coming, Alex.She sent the words to his mind, marveling that she was able to do so. She repeated the same three words over and over again until she reached the motel. Inside, Alex was stretched out on the bed, one arm flung over his eyes. Dropping the sack from the hamburger stand and the car keys on the dresser, she rushed to the bed and sat beside him. \"Alex? Alex, what\u0027s wrong?\" He shook his head. \"Nothing.\" \"Nothing! I heard your voice in my mind begging me not to leave you, and now you tell me nothing\u0027s wrong! Talk to me, Alex.\" \"There\u0027s no reason for you to stay with me now,\" he said, his voice devoid of emotion. \"You can go back home and get on with your life.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You said you wanted to go back home. I won\u0027t stop you.\" She stared down at him, frowning as she tried to make some sense of his words. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. You\u0027re my home.\" \"Am I?\" \"Alex, I love you. You believe that, don\u0027t you?\" \"If you say so.\" \"I do say so. Please tell me what\u0027s wrong. You\u0027re scaring me.\" \"I just want you to be happy, Kara.\" \"I am happy. Happier than I\u0027ve ever been in my life.\" He didn\u0027t look convinced. Feeling as if she were spying, she probed his mind, and there, deep down where he tried to hide them, she found the fears that were troubling him. \"Alex, I love you just the way you are. You must believe that.\" She took his hand and pressed it to her belly. \"I\u0027m having your child, Alex, and it\u0027s going to be beautiful and healthy, and we\u0027re going to live happily ever after, just like Cinderella.\" \"Kara!\" Choking back a sob, he drew her into his arms. \"Forgive me for being such a fool.\" \"I forgive you. I only meant I was happy I could go back to my apartment because it meant I could pick up my clothes and stuff. You\u0027re my home from now on, Alex, whether we\u0027re living in Moulton Bay or on top of your mountain. You believe me, don\u0027t you?\" \"I believe you, Kara. I\u0027ll never doubt you again.\" \"See that you don\u0027t.\" \"Do you want to eat your hamburger now?\" Slowly, she shook her head. \"I\u0027m not hungry for food any more.\" \"Oh?\" A smile played over his lips. \"What are you hungry for?\" \"What do you think?\" He grinned at her. \"Me, too.\" He held out his arms. \"Come here, Mrs. Claybourne. I think I can satisfy your appetite.\" \"I know you can,\" Kara said, slipping her arms around his neck. \"But be warned, Mr. Claybourne, I get hungry often.\" \"I\u0027m counting on it,\" Alex said, and knew he would never doubt her love for him again. With a sigh, he enfolded Kara in his arms and knew that, at long last, he had found a home.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-36.html","bookId":2308,"book":{"id":2308,"title":"Deeper than the Night","description":"Storyline: Townsfolk of Moulton Bay said there was something otherworldly about Alexander Claybourne.
