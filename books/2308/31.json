{"id":95478,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"Kara rose with the dawn, wanting to get an early start, even though she wasn\u0027t sure where to look first.\n Swinging her legs over the edge of the bed, she closed her eyes as a wave of dizziness assaulted her. Stomach churning, she ran into the bathroom, dropped to her knees in front of the toilet, and retched.\n \"Kara? Are you all right?\"\n \"Fine,\" she mumbled. Tearing off several sheets of toilet paper, she wiped her mouth, then stood up. Surprisingly, she felt much better.\n \"Are you sick?\" Gail stood in the doorway, looking worried.\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\" She wiped the perspiration from her forehead, remembering, as she did so, that she\u0027d felt sick to her stomach yesterday morning, too.\n \"Kara?\"\n \"I think I\u0027m pregnant.\"\n Gail\u0027s eyes widened. \"Pregnant!\"\n Kara nodded, wondering why it hadn\u0027t occurred to her before. She was pregnant.\n \"Who\u0027s the father?\"\n \"Alex.\"\n Gail\u0027s mouth fell open, her expression one of utter astonishment. \"But he\u0027s . . . Does he know?\"\n \"No.\" And he probably wouldn\u0027t be too happy with the news when she told him. Unbidden came the memory of Alexander\u0027s voice, warning her that a pregnancy could be dangerous, even fatal, for her and the child.\n \"Are you scared?\"\n Kara nodded. \"Gail, what am I going to do?\"\n Gail shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\" And suddenly, it was as if Gail were the older sister, and Kara the younger. \"I guess you\u0027ll either have the baby, or not.\"\n Kara met her sister\u0027s gaze. \"An abortion?\" She shook her head. \"I couldn\u0027t.\" Not Alex\u0027s baby. She remembered telling him that she would love any child God might grant her. She had been so sure of those words when she had said them, but now . . .\n She couldn\u0027t kill it, couldn\u0027t murder her own unborn child. Even if it was half-alien, even if it was a monster, she couldn\u0027t commit murder. And it was murder. No matter what the pro-choice people said to the contrary, once conceived, the fetus was a human being with a God-given right to life. She believed, with all her heart, that if it was wrong to kill a child once it was born, it was also wrong to kill it in the womb. She had seen pictures of babies who had been aborted_tiny human beings who had been vacuumed out of their mother\u0027s wombs, arms and legs torn off. Who knew what horrible pains those unborn children had suffered? How could anyone ever say such a thing was right?\n \"Gail, I have to find Alex.\" Just saying his name gave her strength.\n \"But how? Where will we look?\"\n \"We\u0027ll start in Moulton Bay.\"\n An hour later, Gail had a bag packed and they were ready to go. Kara and Gail thanked Nancy and her husband for their hospitality, then bid Nana a tearful good-bye.\n \"You\u0027ll be careful?\" Lena said. \"Promise me you\u0027ll be careful.\"\n \"I will,\" Kara said. She hugged her grandmother close, relieved that she seemed fully recovered from her earlier illness. \"Try not to worry, Nana. I\u0027ll call as soon as I can.\"\n Lena Crawford nodded. She hugged Kara once more, kissed Gail on the cheek, then stood in the driveway, blinking back her tears, while Kara drove down the street.\n Gail glanced out the back window and waved. \"She\u0027ll be okay, won\u0027t she?\"\n Kara nodded. \"Of course. Nancy will take good care of her.\"\n \"Where are we going to go first?\"\n \"Alex\u0027s house.\"\n \"You think he\u0027s there?\"\n \"No, but I\u0027ve got to look. If he hasn\u0027t been there,\n I\u0027llknow. And if he has been, well, I\u0027ll know that, too.\"\n Gail frowned. \"How will you know?\"\n \"I just will.\"\n \"If you say so.\" Gail turned on the radio. Locating KROQ, she sat back, her foot tapping in time to Meat Loaf\u0027s latest hit.\n They spent the night in a motel. In the morning, they drove to a small restaurant for breakfast. Gail ordered pancakes, Kara settled for dry toast and coffee. After breakfast, they stopped at one of the mall shops so Kara could buy a change of clothes, underwear, and a nightgown. From there they went into a drug store where she bought a comb, a hairbrush, a toothbrush, and a lipstick, and a small overnight bag to carry everything in. As she paid the bill, it occurred to her that she\u0027d been doing a lot of buying on the run since she met Alexander Claybourne.\n They were on the road again by eleven-thirty.\n \"Where will we look if Alex isn\u0027t home?\" Gail asked.\n \"In Silverdale.\"\n \"Silverdale? Why? What\u0027s there?\"\n \"Barrett has a lab there.\"\n \"I never even heard of Silverdale. Do you know how to get there?\"\n \"No, but I\u0027ll find it if I have to.\"\n It was almost three o\u0027clock when they reached Moulton Bay. Kara\u0027s heart was pounding as she drove down the street to Alexander\u0027s house and pulled into the driveway.\n Kara\u0027s steps were slow as she walked around the back of the house and opened the back door. She knew immediately that Alex hadn\u0027t been there recently. The house was dark and cold, empty of all trace of life.\n Her footsteps echoed off the walls as she walked down the hallway toward the den. She was hardly aware of Gail behind her as she stood in the doorway, her gaze drawn toward the painting over the fireplace. She stared at the man in the picture, at the long black hair ruffled by the wind, at the broad shoulders that seemed slightly bent, as if he carried the weight of the world on his back. She knew it wasn\u0027t Alex, knew she was being fanciful to even think so, and yet it could have been Alex.\n \"He\u0027s not here,\" Gail said. She pointed at the painting. \"Kind of looks like Alex, doesn\u0027t it?\"\n Kara nodded, wondering if she\u0027d ever see Alex again.\n \"This place gives me the creeps,\" Gail remarked. \"Are you sure he isn\u0027t a vampire?\"\n \"Quite sure. Stay here. Ill be right back.\"\n \"Where are you going?\"\n \"Upstairs for a minute.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to stay down here alone.\"\n \"I\u0027ll just be a minute.\"\n Gail looked at her sister oddly, but didn\u0027t argue further.\n Drawn by a power she couldn\u0027t explain, Kara climbed the steps to Alex\u0027s bedroom. She stood inside the door for a moment, her eyes closed. Was it her imagination, or could she feel his essence lingering in the room?\n She opened the closet door and ran her hand over his clothing. Pressing her face against one of his coats, she took a deep breath, filling her nostrils with his scent.\n \"I\u0027ll find you,\" she whispered. \"Somehow I\u0027ll find you.\"\n Alex woke with a start, Kara\u0027s name on his lips. It must have been a dream, he thought, and yet . . . He sat up and summoned her image to mind. Kara. Rich russet-colored hair. Dreamy blue eyes. Skin as soft as a sigh. Kara . . .\n He closed his eyes and knew, knew, she was in his house, thinking of him.\n He tried to reach out to her, to warn her away, but the distance between them was too great. Perhaps, if the sun hadn\u0027t been directly overhead, if he\u0027d been able to concentrate, he would have been able to reach her. But not now, not with the sun blinding him, burning him.\n It was dusk when he woke again.\n Hearing Barrett\u0027s footsteps outside the door, he sat up, his body tensing.\n Barrett entered, followed by Hamblin and Jarvis. He pulled a syringe from his lab coat. \"We\u0027ll need some blood,\" he said.\n \"No.\"\n \"No? No? It would be to your advantage to do as you\u0027re told.\"\n \"Really? Why? What are you going to do to me if I refuse?\"\n A cold smile twisted Barrett\u0027s lips. \"Jarvis was a friend of Kelsey\u0027s. He\u0027d love to have a crack at you.\"\n \"Let him take his best shot.\"\n \"Hamblin. Jarvis. Hold him down.\"\n Alex knew it was useless, foolish, to resist, but he lashed out with his feet as Hamblin and Jarvis reached for him. Jarvis grunted with pain as Alex\u0027s foot caught him in the groin.\n Jarvis stumbled backward and Hamblin and Barrett surged forward, their weight bearing him down, holding him immobile while Barrett drew enough blood to fill a small vial.\n \"Hamblin, take this to the lab. Jarvis, go call our man in Hollywood and tell him I\u0027ll have the results on this batch in a few hours. Tell him if he\u0027s still interested, the price just went up five thousand dollars.\"\n \"Right, boss.\"\n \"It\u0027s all a matter of money now, isn\u0027t it?\" Alex said. Sitting up, be braced his back against the wall and stared at Barrett.\n \"You don\u0027t have enough blood to heal the whole world,\" Barrett replied. \"Research costs money. Selling your blood is going to pay for it.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"You doubt me?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re lying to yourself. This isn\u0027t about helping mankind anymore. It\u0027s about you.\"\n \"That\u0027s not true!\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it?\" Alex asked contemptuously. \"What kind of man keeps another chained to a bed while he steals his blood?\"\n \"But you\u0027re not a man,\" Barrett retorted with a smirk. \"You\u0027re an alien who\u0027s about to do mankind a tremendous favor.\"\n \"And if you get rich in the bargain, so much the better.\"\n Barrett shrugged. \"Ill be most generous with the vaccine once the formula is established and I\u0027ve made the medical journals,\" he said. He smiled as he imagined the accolades he would garner from his colleagues, the speaking engagements, the papers he would publish. In due time, when interest in the vaccine was flagging, he would donate the vaccine to some needy child, thereby reawakening interest in his work.\n \"You\u0027re no better than a vampire, Barrett, living off the blood of others, sucking my blood to keep your dream alive.\"\n \"Shut your mouth!\"\n \"Why? Can\u0027t stand to hear the truth?\"\n A sharp rap on the door cut off Barrett\u0027s reply. A moment later, Hamblin stepped into the room. \"Franklin\u0027s on the phone, Doc. He says you were supposed to meet him thirty minutes ago.\"\n Barrett swore under his breath. \"I forgot all about it. Keep an eye on him,\" Barrett snapped, jerking his chin in Alex\u0027s direction. \"I\u0027ll be back late.\"\n With a last baleful glance at Alex, Barrett stalked out of the room, muttering under his breath.\n \"My offer still stands,\" Alex said. \"A hundred thousand to let me go.\"\n Mitch stared at Alex, his expression thoughtful as he straddled the chair located across from the cot. He\u0027d opened a savings account with the first check. It gave him a sense of security, knowing he had a tidy sum to fall back on if Barrett\u0027s get-rich quick scheme fell through. And now he had a chance to get another hundred thousand . . . .\n He shook his head. \"I can\u0027t. Barrett would_\"\n \"I\u0027ll take care of Barrett.\"\n \"And Jarvis?\"\n \"If I have to. Just turn me loose. Then take the cover off the skylight, prop it open, and get out of here.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know . . .\"\n \"You seem like a pretty decent kid. How\u0027d you get mixed up with Barrett?\"\n \"None of your business.\"\n \"You planning to take Kelsey\u0027s place? Do Barrett\u0027s killing for him?\"\n \"No. He\u0027s paying me to be his bodyguard, that\u0027s all.\"\n \u0027\u0027That\u0027s all?\"\n \"That\u0027s all.\"\n \"What about Jarvis?\"\n \"He\u0027s a killer,\" Mitch admitted reluctantly.\n \"And if things go wrong, if Barrett thinks his scheme is going to fall apart, what do you think your odds of survival are?\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Think about it. Barrett was going to kill Kara because she knew too much. What do you think will happen to you?\"\n \"He wouldn\u0027t do anything like that!\" Mitch exclaimed.\n \"Are you willing to bet your life on it?\"\n \"But he\u0027s a doctor.\"\n \"Yeah.\" Alex glanced pointedly at the heavy shackles that bound his wrists. \"He\u0027s a real credit to his profession.\"\n Rising to his feet, Mitch began to pace the floor, his hands flexing nervously. \"Well, I admit he hasn\u0027t treated you very well, but you\u0027re . . . I mean . . .\"\n \"You mean I\u0027m an alien, so it doesn\u0027t matter.\"\n A bright red flush crept up Hamblin\u0027s neck.\n \"I don\u0027t care what you think of me,\" Alex said curtly. \"I just want to get the hell out of here.\"\n Hamblin came to an abrupt halt near the foot of the bed. \"How do I know you\u0027ll pay me?\"\n \"I guess you\u0027ll just have to trust me.\"\n \"Trust you!\" Hamblin ran a hand through his hair, drummed his fingertips on the bed frame.\n \"The last check was good, wasn\u0027t it? Come on, we\u0027re wasting time.\"\n \"All right, all right, I\u0027ll do it. How will I get my money?\"\n \"You know where Eagle Flats is?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"I\u0027ll meet you at the bank as soon as I can get there.\"\n \"And how will I know when that will be?\"\n \"You just be there every night at ten until I show up.\"\n \"And what if you never show up?\"\n \"I guess that\u0027s a risk you\u0027ll have to take.\"\n \"I want a hundred and fifty grand.\"\n Alex nodded. He could sell the house in Moulton Bay for twice that much.\n \"I\u0027ll go open the skylight,\" Mitch said. \"It might take me a while to get the key to those shackles out of Barrett\u0027s office. I\u0027ll have to pick the lock on his desk.\"\n \"Who else is in the building?\"\n \"No one\u0027s inside. I think Jarvis is keeping watch out front.\"\n \"Hurry.\" Resting his head against the wall, Alex closed his eyes. For the first time in days, he felt a surge of hope.\n A few minutes later, he felt a familiar coolness shimmer across his face. Opening his eyes, he gazed up at the moon. It was full and bright. Relief washed through him as he drew the silvery light deep within himself. He lay there for several minutes, taking deep breaths, feeling the lethargy drain out of his body, feeling his strength begin to return.\n He closed his eyes again, letting the light penetrate into every cell, every fiber. It would take more than one night to restore his full strength, yet he already felt stronger, better, more like himself.\n He estimated thirty-five minutes had passed before Hamblin returned.\n Whistling softly, Mitch entered the room and closed the door behind him.He came to an abrupt halt when he saw Alex. \"You\u0027re looking a lot better,\" he remarked, glancing up at the skylight. \"How come?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have time to explain it to you now. Did you find the key?\"\n Mitch nodded.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure this is a good idea.\"\n Alex swore softly. \"We had a deal.\"\n \"How do I know I can trust you? How do I know you won\u0027t try to take my gun?\"\n \"I just want out of here,\" Alex said. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you, or anyone else. I just want my freedom. Can you understand that?\"\n \"Sure, but . . .\"\n \"Dammit, kid, if I don\u0027t get out of here, I\u0027m gonna be no better than an animal in a zoo!\"\n \"Hey, calm down, man.\"\n \"I am calm. I\u0027m also in a hurry, and . . .\" Alex paused, his head lifting, his nostrils testing the air. Kara. She was there. \"Mitch, turn me loose. Now, before it\u0027s too late.\"\n \"Your word. I want your word you won\u0027t try anything.\"\n \"I won\u0027t hurt you, Mitch. I swear it on Kara\u0027s life.\"\n Mitch hesitated a moment more; then, reaching into his pocket, he withdrew a key and quickly unlocked the cuffs that bound Alex\u0027s hands.\n Alex stood up, massaging his wrists. \"Thanks, kid. I\u0027ll meet you in Eagle Flats as soon as I can. Take care of yourself.\"\n Mitch nodded, a grin hovering over his lips as he watched Alex run, bare-ass naked, down the corridor toward the back door.\n \"How do you know he\u0027s in there?\" Gail asked, peering around Kara. She stared at the dark building that was surrounded by a high fence. \"Even if he\u0027s in there, how will we get in? How will we get him out?\"\n \"Gail, hush!\" Kara said.\n \"You don\u0027t know, do you?\"\n \"No. I just know Alex is in there, and we have to get him out.\"\n \"I think we should call the police.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"There\u0027s no law against being an alien.\"\n \"Gail, for goodness sakes, you of all people should know what will happen to Alex if people find out what he is.\"\n \"Oh, yeah, I didn\u0027t think of that. Well, what are we gonna do?\"\n \"I wish I knew. I . . . what\u0027s that?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"There?\"\n \"Looks like a naked man,\" Gail said. She stepped around Kara to get a better look. \"It is a naked man!\"\n \"It\u0027s Alex,\" Kara said. Here. She called to him with her mind. I\u0027m here.\n Kara?\n Yes. Hurry.\n Can you distract the guard?\n Yes.\"Gail, I want you to go up to the fence and call the guard. Tell him you\u0027re lost. Ask if you can use the phone.\"\n \"Really? All right!\" Hardly able to contain her excitement, Gail ran toward the fence. \"Hey, in there!\" she called. \"Hey, mister, can you help me?\"\n Alex stood in the shadows, watching as the guard left his shack and ambled toward the gate in the fence.\n \"What are you doing out here at this time of night, girl?\" the guard asked.\n \"I\u0027m lost. Can I use your phone?\"\n \"Where\u0027s your parents?\"\n \"If I knew that, I wouldn\u0027t be lost. Please, mister, I\u0027m scared. Can I use your phone?\"\n Gail clenched her hands together, her heart pounding as she saw Alex creeping up behind the guard. \"Can I?\" She\u0027d never seen a naked man before and it took every ounce of concentration to keep from staring, to keep her voice even.\n \"Sure, kid,\" the guard said. He removed a ring of keys from his belt and unlocked the gate. \"Come on . . .\"\n The air whooshed out of the guard\u0027s lungs as Alex struck the man over the head with a beer bottle he\u0027d found lying beside the shack.\n \"Hi, Gail,\" Alex said.\n \"Hi. What happened to your clothes?\"\n \"I lost them.\"\n \"You\u0027ll be lucky if you\u0027re not arrested for indecent exposure,\" Kara remarked, and then she hurled herself into his arms.\n Alex hugged her hard. \"We\u0027d better get out of here.\"\n Kara nodded. She wanted to hold him, to run her hands over him, to assure herself that he was all right, but it would have to wait. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n \"Here,\" Gail said. She handed Alex an overcoat. \"I found it in the shack.\"\n \"Thanks.\" He slipped it on, then grabbed Kara\u0027s hand. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\n \"Stop!\"\n Alex glanced over his shoulder to see Barrett running toward them brandishing a pistol. Dammit! What was he doing back so early?\n \"Stop, damn you! Stop, or I\u0027ll shoot!\"\n Alex swore as a gunshot ripped through the night. \"Run, Kara!\" He shoved Gail toward the gate. \"Hurry, both of you!\"\n \"Alex_\"\n \"I\u0027m right behind you.\"\n The sound of gunfire followed them as they ran out the gate and down the street.\n \"Where\u0027s your car?\" Alex shouted to be heard above the staccato bark of gunfire coming from behind them.\n \"Around the corner.\"\n They were going to make it, he thought. And then he saw Kara falter, heard her gasp of pain, and knew she\u0027d been hit.\n Without breaking stride, he scooped her up in one arm, grabbed Gail by the hand, and turned the corner.\n There was only one car parked at the curb. \"Kara, where are your keys?\"\n \"Coat pocket,\" she rasped. \"Door\u0027s . . . not locked.\"\n Flinging the door open, he placed Kara on the seat, shoved Gail in beside her, then went around and slid behind the wheel.\n He rammed the key into the ignition, gunned the motor and pulled away from the curb just as Barrett rounded the corner. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-31.html","bookId":2308,"book":{"id":2308,"title":"Deeper than the Night","description":"Storyline: \n Townsfolk of Moulton Bay said there was something otherworldly about Alexander Claybourne.
