{"id":101250,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I got a phone call the next night at Merlotte\u0027s. Of course, it\u0027s not a good thing to get phone calls at work; Sam doesn\u0027t like it, unless there\u0027s some kind of home emergency. Since I get the least of any of the barmaids - in fact, I could count the calls I\u0027d gotten at work on one hand - I tried not to feel guilty when I gestured to Sam that I\u0027d take the call back at the phone on his desk. \"Hello,\" I said cautiously. \"Sookie,\" said a familiar voice. \"Oh, Pam. Hi.\" I was relieved, but only for a second. Pam was Eric\u0027s second in command, and she was his child, in the vampire sense. \"The boss wants to see you,\" she said. \"I\u0027m calling from his office.\" Eric\u0027s office, in the back of his club, Fangtasia, was well soundproofed. I could barely hear KDED, the all-vampire radio station, playing in the background: Clapton\u0027s version of \"After Midnight.\" \"Well, lah-de-dah. He\u0027s too lofty co make his own phone calls?\" \"Yes,\" Pam said. That Pam - literal-minded was the phrase for her. \"What\u0027s this about?\" \"I am following his instructions,\" she said. \"He tells me to call the telepath, I call you. You are summoned.\" \"Pam, I need a little more explanation than that. I don\u0027t especially want to see Eric.\" \"You are being recalcitrant?\" Uh-oh. I hadn\u0027t had that on my Word of the Day calendar yet. \"I\u0027m not sure I understand.\" It\u0027s better to just go on and confess ignorance than try to fake my way through. Pam sighed, a long-suffering gust of sound. \"You\u0027re digging in your heels,\" she clarified, her English accent making itself known. \"And you shouldn\u0027t be. Eric treats you very well.\" She sounded faintly incredulous. \"I\u0027m not giving up work or free time to drive over to Shreveport because Mr. High and Mighty wants me to jump to do his bidding,\" I protested - reasonably, I thought. \"He can haul his ass over here if he wants to tell me something. Or he can pick up the telephone his ownself.\" So there. \"If he had wanted to pick up the phone \u0027his ownself,\u0027 as you put it, he would have done so. Be here Friday night by eight, he bids me tell you.\" \"Sorry, no can do.\" A significant silence. \"You won\u0027t come?\" \"I can\u0027t. I have a date,\" I said, trying to keep any trace of smugness out of my voice. There was another silence. Then Pam snickered. \"Oh, that\u0027s rich,\" she said, abruptly switching to American vernacular. \"Oh, I\u0027m going to love telling him that.\" Her reaction made me begin to feel uneasy. \"Um, Pam,\" I began, wondering if I should backpedal, \"listen...\" \"Oh, no,\" she said, almost laughing out loud, which was very un-Pam-like. \"You tell him I did say thanks for the calendar proofs,\" I said. Eric, always thinking of ways to make Fangtasia more lucrative, had come up with a vampire calendar to sell in the little gift shop. Eric himself was Mr. January. He\u0027d posed with a bed and a long white fur robe. Eric and the bed were set against a pale gray background hung with giant glittering snowflakes. He wasn\u0027t wearing the robe: oh, no. He wasn\u0027t wearing anything. He had one bent knee on the rumpled bed, and the other foot was on the floor, and he was looking directly at the camera, smoldering. (He could have taught Claude a few lessons.) Eric\u0027s blond hair fell in a tousled mane around his shoulders, and his right hand gripped the robe tossed on the bed, so the white fur rose just high enough to cover his kit \u0027n\u0027 kaboodle. His body was turned just slightly to flaunt the curve of his world-class butt. A light trail of dark blond hair pointed south of his navel. It practically screamed, \"Carrying concealed!\" I happened to know that Eric\u0027s pistol was more of a .357 Magnum than a snub-nose. Somehow I\u0027d never gotten past looking at January. \"Oh, I\u0027ll let him know,\" Pam said. \"Eric said many people wouldn\u0027t like it if I were in the calendar made for women... so I\u0027m in the one for men. Would you like me to send you a copy of my picture, as well?\" \"That surprises me,\" I told her. \"It really does. I mean, that you wouldn\u0027t mind posing.\" I had a hard time imagining her participation in a project that would pander to human tastes. \"Eric tells me to pose, I pose,\" she said matter-of-factly. Though Eric had considerable power over Pam since he was her maker, I have to say that I\u0027d never known Eric to ask Pam to do anything she wasn\u0027t ready to do. Either he knew her well (which, of course, he did) or Pam was willing to do just about anything. \"I have a whip in my picture,\" Pam said. \"The photographer says it\u0027ll sell a million.\" Pam had wide-ranging tastes in the area of sex. After a long moment while I contemplated the mental image that raised, I said, \"I\u0027m sure it will, Pam. But I\u0027ll give it a pass.\" \"We\u0027ll all get a percentage, all of us who agreed to pose.\" \"But Eric will get a bigger percentage than the rest.\" \"Well, he\u0027s the sheriff,\" Pam said reasonably. \"Right. Well, bye.\" I started to hang up. \"Wait, what am I to tell Eric?\" \"Just tell him the truth.\" \"You know he\u0027ll be angry.\" Pam didn\u0027t sound at all scared. In fact, she sounded gleeful. \"Well, that\u0027s his problem,\" I said, maybe a bit childishly, and this time I did hang up. An angry Eric would surely be my problem, too. I had a nasty feeling I\u0027d taken a serious step in denying Eric. I had no idea what would happen now. When I\u0027d first gotten to know the sheriff of Area Five, I\u0027d been dating Bill. Eric had wanted to use my unusual talent. He\u0027d simply held hurting Bill over my head to get me to comply. When I\u0027d broken up with Bill, Eric had lacked any means of coercion until I\u0027d needed a favor from him, and then I\u0027d supplied Eric with the most potent ammunition of all - the knowledge that I\u0027d shot Debbie Pelt. It didn\u0027t matter that he\u0027d hidden her body and her car and he couldn\u0027t himself remember where; the accusation would be enough to ruin the rest of my life, even if it was never proved. Even if I could bring myself to deny it. As I carried out my duties in the bar the rest of that night, I found myself wondering if Eric really would reveal my secret. If Eric told the police what I\u0027d done, he\u0027d have to admit he\u0027d had a part in it, wouldn\u0027t he? I was waylaid by Detective Andy Bellefleur when I was on my way to the bar. I\u0027ve known Andy and his sister Portia all my life. They\u0027re a few years older than me, but we\u0027d been through the same schools, grown up in the same town. Like me, they\u0027d been largely raised by their grandmother. The detective and I have had our ups and downs. Andy had been dating a young schoolteacher, Halleigh Robinson, for a few months now. Tonight, he had a secret to share with me and a favor to ask. \"Listen, she\u0027s going to order the chicken basket,\" he said, without preamble. I glanced over to their table, to make sure Halleigh was sitting with her back to me. She did. \"When you bring the food to the table, make sure this is in it, covered up.\" He stuffed a little velvet-covered box into my hand. There was a ten-dollar bill under it. \"Sure, Andy, no problem,\" I said, smiling. \"Thanks, Sookie,\" he said, and for once he smiled back, a simple and uncomplicated and terrified smile. Andy had been right on the money. Halleigh ordered the chicken basket when I went to their table. \"Make that extra fries,\" I said to our new cook when I turned in the order. I wanted plenty of camouflage. The cook turned from the grill to glare at me. We\u0027ve had an assortment of cooks, of every age, color, gender, and sexual preference. We even had a vampire, once. Our current cook was a middle-aged black woman named Callie Collins. Callie was heavy, so heavy I didn\u0027t know how she could get through the hours she spent standing on her feet in the hot kitchen. \"Extra fries?\" Callie said, as if she\u0027d never heard of such a thing. \"Uh-huh. People get extra fries when they pay for them, not because they friends of yours.\" It could be that Callie was so sharp-edged because she was old enough to remember the bad old days when blacks and whites had different schools, different waiting rooms, different water fountains. I didn\u0027t remember any of those things, and I was not willing to take into account Callie\u0027s bundle of baggage every time I talked to her. \"They paid extra,\" I lied, not wanting to call an explanation through the service pass-through that anyone close enough could overhear. I\u0027d put a dollar of my tip into the till, instead, to make up the money. Despite our differences, I wished Andy and his schoolteacher well. Anyone who was going to be Caroline Bellefleur\u0027s granddaughter-in-law deserved a romantic moment. When Callie called up the basket, I trotted over to get it. Slipping the little box under the fries was harder than I imagined, and it required a bit of surreptitious rearrangement. I wondered if Andy had realized that the velvet would get greasy and salty. Oh well, this wasn\u0027t my romantic gesture, but his. I carried the tray to the table with happy anticipation. In fact, Andy had to warn me (with a severe glance) to pull my face into more neutral lines as I served their food. Andy already had a beer in front of him, and she had a glass of white wine. Halleigh wasn\u0027t a big drinker, as befitted an elementary school teacher. I turned away as soon as the food was on the table, even forgetting to ask them if they needed anything else, like a good waitress should. It was beyond me to try to stay detached after that. Though I tried not to be obvious, I watched the couple as closely as I could. Andy was on pins and needles, and I could hear his brain, which was simply agitated. He really wasn\u0027t sure whether he\u0027d be accepted, and his mind was running through the list of things she might object to: the fact that Andy was almost ten years older, his hazardous profession... I knew the moment when she spied the box. Maybe it wasn\u0027t nice of me to eavesdrop mentally on a very special moment, but to tell you the truth, I didn\u0027t even think of that at the time. Though ordinarily I keep myself well guarded, I\u0027m used to dropping into people\u0027s heads if I spy something interesting. I\u0027m also used to believing that my ability is a minus, not a plus, so I guess I feel entitled to whatever fun I can have with it. I had my back to them, clearing off a table, which I should have left for the busboy to do. So I was close enough to hear. She was frozen for a long moment. \"There\u0027s a box in my food,\" she said, finally, keeping her voice very low because she thought she\u0027d upset Sam if she made a fuss. \"I know,\" he said. \"It\u0027s from me.\" She knew then; everything in her brain began to accelerate, and the thoughts practically tripped over themselves in their eagerness. \"Oh, Andy,\" she whispered. She must have opened the box. It was all I could do not to turn around and look right along with her. \"Do you like it?\" \"Yes, it\u0027s beautiful.\" \"Will you wear it?\" There was a silence. Her head was so confused. Half of it was going \"Yippee!\" and half of it was troubled. \"Yes, with one stipulation,\" she said slowly. I could feel his shock. Whatever Andy had expected, it wasn\u0027t this. \"And that would be?\" he asked, suddenly sounding much more like a cop than a lover. \"We have to live in our own place.\" \"What?\" Again, she\u0027d surprised Andy. \"I\u0027ve always gotten the idea that you assumed you\u0027d stay in the family home, with your grandmother and your sister, even after you got married. It\u0027s a wonderful old house, and your grandmother and Portia are great women.\" That was tactful. Good for Halleigh. \"But I\u0027d like to have a home of my own,\" she said gently, earning my admiration. And then I really had to haul ass; I had tables to tend to. But as I refilled beer mugs, cleared empty plates, and took more money to Sam at the cash register, I was filled with awe at Halleigh\u0027s stand, since the Bellefleur mansion was Bon Temps\u0027s premier residence. Most young women would give a finger or two to live there, especially since the big old house had been extensively remodeled and freshened with the influx of money from a mysterious stranger. That stranger was actually Bill, who\u0027d discovered that the Bellefleurs were descendants of his. He\u0027d known they wouldn\u0027t accept money from a vampire, so he\u0027d arranged the whole \"mysterious legacy\" ruse, and Caroline Bellefleur had jumped into spending it on the mansion with as much relish as Andy ate a cheeseburger. Andy caught up with me a few minutes later. He snagged me on the way to Sid Matt Lancaster\u0027s table, so the aged lawyer had to wait a bit extra for his hamburger and fries. \"Sookie, I have to know,\" he said urgently, but in a very low tone. \"What, Andy?\" I was alarmed at his intensity. \"Does she love me?\" There were edges of humiliation in his head, that he\u0027d actually asked me. Andy was proud, and he wanted some kind of assurance that Halleigh didn\u0027t want his family name or his family home as he\u0027d found other women had. Well, he\u0027d found out about the home. Halleigh didn\u0027t want it, and he would move into some humble, small house with her, if she really loved him. No one had ever demanded this of me before. After all the years of wanting people to believe in me, understand my freakish talent, I found I didn\u0027t enjoy being taken seriously, after all. But Andy was waiting for an answer, and I couldn\u0027t refuse. He was one of the most dogged men I\u0027d ever met. \"She loves you as much as you love her,\" I said, and he let go of my arm. I continued on my way to Sid Matt\u0027s table. When I glanced back at him, he was staring at me. Chew on that, Andy Bellefleur, I thought. Then I felt a little ashamed of myself. But he shouldn\u0027t have asked, if he didn\u0027t want to know the answer. There was something in the woods around my house. I\u0027d gotten ready for bed as soon as I\u0027d come home, because one of my favorite moments in every twenty-four hours is when I get to put on my nightgown. It was warm enough that I didn\u0027t need a bathrobe, so I was roaming around in my old blue knee-length sleep tee. I was just thinking of shutting the kitchen window, since the March night was getting a little chilly. I\u0027d been listening to the sounds of the night while I washed dishes; the frogs and the bugs had been filling the air with their chorus. Suddenly, the noises that had made the night seem as friendly and busy as the day had come to a stop, cut off in midcry. I paused, my hands immersed in the hot soapy water. Peering out into the darkness didn\u0027t help a bit, and I realized how visible I must be, standing at an open window with its curtains flung wide apart. The yard was lit up with the security light, but beyond the trees that ringed the clearing, the woods lay dark and still. Something was out there. I closed my eyes and tried to reach out with my brain, and I found some kind of activity. But it wasn\u0027t clear enough to define. I thought about phoning Bill, but I\u0027d called him before when I\u0027d been worried about my safety. I couldn\u0027t let it become a habit. Hey, maybe the watcher in the woods was Bill himself? He sometimes roamed around at night, and he came to check on me from time to time. I looked longingly over at the telephone on the wall at the end of the counter. (Well, where the counter would be when it was all put together.) My new telephone was portable. I could grab it, retreat to my bedroom, and call Bill in a snap of the fingers, since he was on my speed dial. If he answered the phone, I\u0027d know whatever was out in the woods was something I needed to worry about. But if he was home, he\u0027d come racing over here. He\u0027d hear my call like this: \"Oh, Bill, please come save me! I can\u0027t think of anything to do but call a big, strong vampire to come to my rescue!\" I made myself admit that I really knew that whatever was in the woods, it wasn\u0027t Bill. I\u0027d gotten a brain signal of some kind. If the lurker had been a vampire, I would have sensed nothing. Only twice had I gotten a flicker of a signal from a vampire brain, and it had been like a flash of electricity in an outage. And right by that telephone was the back door - which wasn\u0027t locked. Nothing on earth could keep me at the sink after the fact of the open door had occurred to me. I simply ran for it. I stepped out onto the back porch, nipped the latch on the glass door there, and jumped back into the kitchen proper and locked the big wooden door, which I\u0027d had outfitted with a thumb latch and a deadbolt. I leaned against the door after it was safely locked. Better than anyone I could think of, I knew the futility of doors and locks. To a vampire, the physical barrier was nothing - but a vampire had to be invited in. To a Were, doors were of more consequence, but still not much of a problem; with their incredible strength, Weres could go wherever they damn well chose. The same held true of other shifters. Why didn\u0027t I just hold an open house? However, I felt wonderfully better with two locked doors between me and whatever was in the woods. I knew the front door was locked and bolted, since it hadn\u0027t been opened in days. I didn\u0027t get that many visitors, and I normally entered and departed through the back. I crept back to the window, which I closed and locked. I drew the curtains, too. I\u0027d done everything to increase my security I could do. I went back to the dishes. I got a wet circle on the front of my sleep tee because I had to lean against the edge of the sink to steady my shaking legs. But I made myself continue until all the dishes were safely in the drainer and the sink had been wiped clean. I listened intently after that. The woods were still silent. No matter how I listened with every sense at my disposal, that faint signal did not impinge on my brain again. It was gone. I sat in the kitchen for a while, brain still in high gear, but then I forced myself to follow my usual routine. My heart rate had returned to normal by the time I brushed my teeth, and as I climbed into bed I had almost persuaded myself that nothing had happened out there in the silent darkness. But I\u0027m careful about being honest inside. I knew some creature had been out in my woods; and that creature had been something bigger and scarier than a raccoon. Quite soon after I\u0027d turned my bedside light off, I heard the bugs and the frogs resume their chorus. Finally, when it continued uninterrupted, I slept.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-3.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
