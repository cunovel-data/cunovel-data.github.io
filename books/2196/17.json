{"id":101263,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The queen owned a block of buildings in down-town New Orleans, maybe three blocks from the edge of the French Quarter. That tells you what kind of money she was pulling in, right there. We had an early dinner - I realized I was really hungry - and then Claudine dropped me off two blocks away, because the traffic and tourist congestion were intense close to the queen\u0027s headquarters. Though the general public didn\u0027t know Sophie-Anne Leclerq was a queen, they knew she was a very wealthy vampire who owned a hell of a lot of real estate and spent lots of money in the community. Plus, her bodyguards were colorful and had gotten special permits to carry arms in the city limits. This meant her office building/living quarters were on the tourist list of things to see, especially at night.\\n\\n Though traffic did surround the building during the day, at night the square of streets around it was open only to pedestrians. Buses parked a block away, and the tour guides would lead the out-of-towners past the altered building. Walking tours and gaggles of independent tourists included what the guides called \"Vampire Headquarters\" in their plans.\\n\\n Security was very evident. This block would be a natural target for Fellowship of the Sun bombers. A few vampire-owned businesses in other cities had been attacked, and the queen was not about to lose her life-after-death in such a way.\\n\\n The vampire guards were on duty, and they were scary-looking as hell. The queen had her own vampire SWAT team. Though vampires were simply lethal all on their own, the queen had found that humans paid more attention if they found the silhouettes recognizable. Not only were the guards heavily armed, but they wore black bulletproof armor over black uniforms. It was lethal-killer chic.\\n\\n Claudine had prepared me for all this over dinner, and when she let me out, I felt fully briefed. I also felt as if I were going to the Queen of England\u0027s garden party in all my new finery. At least I didn\u0027t have to wear a hat. But my brown high heels were a risky proposition on the rough paving.\\n\\n \"Behold the headquarters of New Orleans\u0027s most famous and visible vampire, Sophie-Anne LeClerq,\" a tour guide was telling his group. He was dressed colorfully in a sort of colonial outfit: tricorn hat, knee breeches, hose, buckled shoes. My goodness. As I paused to listen, his eyes flickered over to me, took in my outfit, and sharpened with interest.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re calling on Sophie-Anne, you can\u0027t go in casual,\" he told the group, and gestured to me. \"This young lady is wearing proper dress for an interview with the vampire... one of America\u0027s most prominent vampires.\" He grinned at the group, inviting them to enjoy his reference.\\n\\n There were fifty other vampires just as prominent.\\n\\n Maybe not as publicly oriented or as colorful as Sophie-Anne Leclerq, but the public didn\u0027t know that.\\n\\n Rather than being surrounded with the appropriate air of exotic deadliness, the queen\u0027s \"castle\" was more of a macabre Disneyland, thanks to the souvenir peddlers, the tour guides, and the curious gawkers. There was even a photographer. As I approached the first ring of guards, a man jumped in front of me and snapped my picture. I was frozen by the flash of light and stared after him - or in what I thought was his direction - while my eyes adjusted. When I was able to see him clearly, I found he was a small, grubby man with a big camera and a determined expression. He bustled off immediately to what I guessed was his accustomed station, a corner on the opposite side of the street. He didn\u0027t offer to sell me a picture or tell me where I could purchase one, and he didn\u0027t give me any explanation.\\n\\n I had a bad feeling about this incident. When I talked to one of the guards, my suspicion was confirmed.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a Fellowship spy,\" said the vampire, nodding in the little man\u0027s direction. He\u0027d located my name on a checklist clamped to a clipboard. The guard himself was a sturdy man with brown skin and a nose as curved as a rainbow. He\u0027d been born somewhere in the Middle East, once-upon a time. The name patch attached with Velcro to his helmet said RASUL.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re forbidden to kill him,\" Rasul said, as if he were explaining a slightly embarrassing folk custom. He smiled at me, which was kind of disconcerting, too. The black helmet came down low on his face and the chinstrap was the kind that actually rounded his chin, so I could see only a little bit of his face. At the moment, that bit was mostly sharp, white, teeth. \"The Fellowship photographs everyone who goes in and out of this place, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything we can do about it, since we want to keep the goodwill of the humans.\"\\n\\n Rasul correctly assumed I was a vampire ally, since I was on the visitors list, and was treating me with a camaraderie that I found relaxing. \"It would be lovely if something happened to his camera,\" I suggested. \"The Fellowship is hunting me already.\" Though I felt pretty guilty, asking a vampire to arrange an accident to another human being, I was fond enough of my own life to want it saved.\\n\\n His eyes gleamed as we passed under a streetlight. The light caught them so that for a moment they shone red, like people\u0027s eyes sometimes do when the photographer is using a flash.\\n\\n \"Oddly enough, a few things have happened to his cameras already,\" Rasul said. \"In fact, two of them have been smashed beyond repair. What\u0027s one more accident? I\u0027m not guaranteeing anything, but we\u0027ll do our best, lovely lady.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you so much,\" I said. \"Anything you can do will be much appreciated. After tonight, I can talk to a witch who could maybe take care of that problem for you. Maybe she could make all the pictures turn out overexposed, or something. You should give her a call.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s an excellent idea. Here is Melanie,\" he said, as we reached the main doors. \"I\u0027ll pass you on to her, and return to my post. I\u0027ll see you when you exit, get the witch\u0027s name and address?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Did anyone ever tell you that you smell enchantingly like a fairy?\" Rasul said.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve been with my fairy godmother,\" I explained. \"She took me shopping.\"\\n\\n \"And the result was wonderful,\" he said gallantly.\\n\\n \"You flatterer.\" I couldn\u0027t help but smile back at him. My ego had taken a blow to the solar plexus the night before (but I wasn\u0027t thinking about that), and a little thing like the guard\u0027s admiration was just what I needed, even if it was really Claudine\u0027s smell that had triggered it.\\n\\n Melanie was a delicate woman, even in the SWAT gear. \"Yum, yum, you do smell like fairy,\" she said. She consulted her own clipboard. \"You are the Stackhouse woman? The queen expected you last night.\"\\n\\n \"I got hurt.\" I held my arm out, showing the bandage. Thanks to a lot of Advil, the pain was down to a dull throb.\\n\\n \"Yes, I heard about it. The new one is having a great night tonight. He received instructions, he has a mentor, and he has a volunteer donor. When he feels more like his new self, he may tell us how he came to be turned.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" I heard my voice falter when I realized she was talking about Jake Purifoy. \"He might not remember?\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s a surprise attack, sometimes they don\u0027t remember for a while,\" she said, and shrugged. \"But it always comes back, sooner or later. In the meantime, he\u0027ll have a free lunch.\" She laughed at my inquiring look. \"They register for the privilege, you know. Stupid humans.\" She shrugged. \"There\u0027s no fun in that, once you\u0027ve gotten over the thrill of feeding, in and of itself. The fun was always in the chase.\" Melanie really wasn\u0027t happy with the new vampire policy of feeding only from willing humans or from the synthetic blood. She clearly felt the lack of her former diet.\\n\\n I tried to look politely interested.\\n\\n \"When the prey makes the first advance, it\u0027s just not the same,\" she grumped. \"People these days.\" She shook her little head in weary exasperation. Since she was so small that her helmet almost wobbled on her head, I could feel myself smiling.\\n\\n \"So, he wakes up and you all herd the volunteer in? Like dropping a live mouse into a snake\u0027s tank?\" I worked to keep my face serious. I didn\u0027t want Melanie to think I was making fun of her personally.\\n\\n After a suspicious moment, Melanie said, \"More or less. He\u0027s been lectured. There are other vampires present.\"\\n\\n \"And the volunteer survives?\"\\n\\n \"They sign a release beforehand,\" Melanie said, carefully.\\n\\n I shuddered.\\n\\n Rasul had escorted me from the other side of the street to the main entrance to the queen\u0027s domain. It was a three-story office building, perhaps dating from the fifties, and extending a whole city block. In other places, the basement would have been the vampires\u0027 retreat, but in New Orleans, with its high water table, that was impossible. All the windows had received a distinctive treatment. The panels that covered them were decorated in a Mardi Gras theme, so the staid brick building was pepped up with pink, purple, and green designs on a white or black background. There were iridescent patches on the shutters, too, like Mardi Gras beads. The effect was disconcerting.\\n\\n \"What does she do when she throws a party?\" I asked. Despite the shutters, the prosaic office rectangle was simply not festive.\\n\\n \"Oh, she owns an old monastery,\" Melanie said. \"You can get a brochure about it before you go. That\u0027s where all the state functions are held. Some of the old ones can\u0027t go into the former chapel, but other than that... it\u0027s got a high wall all around, so it\u0027s easy to patrol, and it\u0027s decorated real nice. The queen has apartments there, but it\u0027s too insecure for year-round living.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say. I doubted I would ever see the queen\u0027s state residence. But Melanie seemed bored and inclined to chat. \"You were Hadley\u0027s cousin, I hear?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Strange, to think of having living relatives.\" For a moment, she looked far away, and as wistful as a vampire can look. Then she seemed to kind of shake herself mentally. \"Hadley wasn\u0027t bad for one so young. But she seemed to take her vampire longevity a little too much for granted.\"\\n\\n Melanie shook her head. \"She should never have crossed someone as old and wily as Waldo.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s for damn sure,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Chester,\" Melanie called. Chester was the next guard in line, and he was standing with a familiar figure clothed in the (what I was coming to think of as) usual SWAT garb.\\n\\n \"Bubba!\" I exclaimed, as the vampire said, \"Miss Sookie!\" Bubba and I hugged, to the vampires\u0027 amusement. Vampires don\u0027t shake hands, in the ordinary course of things, and hugging is just as outre in their culture.\\n\\n I was glad to see they hadn\u0027t let him have a gun, just the accoutrements of the guards. He was looking fine in the military outfit, and I told him so. \"Black looks real good with your hair,\" I said, and Bubba smiled his famous smile.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re mighty nice to say so,\" he said. \"Thank you very much.\"\\n\\n Back in the day, everyone in the world had known Bubba\u0027s face and smile. When he\u0027d been wheeled into the morgue in Memphis, a vampire attendant had detected the tiniest flicker of life. Since the attendant was a huge fan, he had taken on the responsibility for bringing the singer over, and a legend had been born. Unfortunately, Bubba\u0027s body had been so saturated with drugs and physical woes that the conversion hadn\u0027t been entirely successful, and the vampire world passed Bubba around like the public relations nightmare he was.\\n\\n \"How long have you been here, Bubba?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Oh, a couple of weeks, but I like it real well,\" he said. \"Lots of stray cats.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" I said, trying not to think about that too graphically. I really like cats. So did Bubba, but not in the same way.\\n\\n \"If a human catches a glimpse of him, they think he\u0027s an impersonator,\" Chester said quietly. Melanie had gone back to her post, and Chester, who\u0027d been a sandy-haired kid from the backwoods with poor dentition when he was taken, was now in charge of me. \"That\u0027s fine, most often. But every so now and then, they call him by his used-to-be name. Or they ask him to sing.\"\\n\\n Bubba very seldom sang these days, though every now and then he could be coaxed into belting out a familiar song or two. That was a memorable occasion. Most often, though, he denied he could sing a note, and he usually got very agitated when he was called by his original name.\\n\\n He trailed along after us as Chester led me further into the building. We had turned, and gone up a floor, encountering more and more vampires - and a few humans - heading here or there with a purposeful air. It was like any busy office building, any weekday, except the workers were vampires and the sky outside was as dark as the New Orleans sky ever got. As we walked, I noticed that some vampires seemed more at ease than others. I observed that the wary vamps were all wearing the same pins attached to their collars, pins in the shape of the state of Arkansas. These vamps must be part of the entourage of the queen\u0027s husband, Peter Threadgill. When one of the Louisiana vampires bumped into an Arkansas vampire, the Arkansan snarled and for a second I thought there would be a fight in the corridor over a slight accident.\\n\\n Jeesh, I\u0027d be glad to get out of here. The atmosphere was tense.\\n\\n Chester stopped before a door that didn\u0027t look any different from all the other closed doors, except for the two whacking big vampires outside it. The two must have been considered giants in their day, since they stood perhaps six foot three. They looked like brothers, but maybe it was just their size and mien, and the color of their chestnut hair, that sparked the comparison: big as boulders, bearded, with pony-tails that trailed down their backs, the two looked like prime meat for the pro wrestling circuit. One had a huge scar across his face, acquired before death, of course. The other had had some skin disease in his original life. They weren\u0027t just display items; they were absolutely lethal.\\n\\n (By the way, some promoter had had the idea for a vampire wrestling circuit a couple of years before, but it went down in flames immediately. At the first match, one vamp had ripped another\u0027s arm off, on live TV. Vamps don\u0027t get the concept of exhibition fighting.)\\n\\n These two vampires were hung with knives, and each had an ax in his belt. I guess they figured if someone had penetrated this far, guns weren\u0027t going to make a difference. Plus their own bodies were weapons.\\n\\n \"Bert, Bert,\" Chester said, nodding to each one in turn. \"This here\u0027s the Stackhouse woman; the queen wants to see her.\"\\n\\n He turned and walked away, leaving me with the queen\u0027s bodyguards.\\n\\n Screaming didn\u0027t seem like a good idea, so I said, \"I can\u0027t believe you both have the same name. Surely he made a mistake?\"\\n\\n Two pairs of brown eyes focused on me intently. \"I am Sigebert,\" the scarred one said, with a heavy accent I couldn\u0027t identify. He said his name as See-ya-bairt. Chester was using a very Americanized version of what must be a very old name. \"Dis my brodder, Wybert.\"\\n\\n This is my brother, Way-bairt? \"Hello,\" I said, trying not to twitch. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse.\"\\n\\n They seemed unimpressed. Just then, one of the pinned vampires squeezed past, casting a look of scarcely veiled contempt at the brothers, and the atmosphere in the corridor became lethal. Sigebert and Wybert watched the vamp, a tall woman in a business suit, until she rounded a corner. Then their attention switched back to me.\\n\\n \"The queen is... busy,\" Wybert said. \"When she wants you in her room, the light, it will shine.\" He indicated a round light set in the wall to the right of the door.\\n\\n So I was stuck here for an indefinite time - until the light, it shone. \"Do your names have a meaning? I\u0027m guessing they\u0027re, um, early English?\" My voice petered out.\\n\\n \"We were Saxons. Our fadder went from Germany to England, you call now,\" Wybert said. \"My name mean Bright Battle.\"\\n\\n \"And mine, Bright Victory,\" Sigebert added.\\n\\n I remembered a program I\u0027d seen on the History Channel. The Saxons eventually became the Anglo-Saxons and later were overwhelmed by the Normans. \"So you were raised to be warriors,\" I said, trying to look intelligent.\\n\\n They exchanged glances. \"There was nothing else,\" Sigebert said. The end of his scar wiggled when he talked, and I tried not to stare. \"We were sons of war leader.\"\\n\\n I could think of a hundred questions to ask them about their lives as humans, but standing in the middle of a hallway in an office building in the night didn\u0027t seem the time to do it. \"How\u0027d you happen to become vampires?\" I asked. \"Or is that a tacky question? If it is, just forget I said anything. I don\u0027t want to step on any toes.\"\\n\\n Sigebert actually glanced down at his feet, so I got the idea that colloquial English wasn\u0027t their strong suit. \"This woman... very beautiful... she come to us the night before battle,\" Wybert said haltingly. \"She say... we be stronger if she... have us.\"\\n\\n They looked at me inquiringly, and I nodded to show I understood that Wybert was saying the vampire had implied her interest was in bedding them. Or had they understood she meant to bleed them? I couldn\u0027t tell. I thought it was a mighty ambitious vampire who would take on these two humans at the same time.\\n\\n \"She did not say we only fight at night after that,\" Sigebert said, shrugging to show that there had been a catch they hadn\u0027t understood. \"We did not ask plenty questions. We too eager!\" And he smiled. Okay, nothing so scary as a vampire left with only his fangs. It was possible Sigebert had more teeth in the back of his mouth, ones I couldn\u0027t see from my height, but Chester\u0027s plentiful-though-crooked teeth had looked super in comparison.\\n\\n \"That must have been a very long time ago,\" I said, since I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. \"How long have you worked for the queen?\"\\n\\n Sigebert and Wybert looked at each other. \"Since that night,\" Wybert said, astonished I hadn\u0027t understood. \"We are hers.\"\\n\\n My respect for the queen, and maybe my fear of the queen, escalated. Sophie-Anne, if that was her real name, had been brave, strategic, and busy in her career as a vampire leader. She\u0027d brought them over and kept them with her, in a bond that - the one whose name I wasn\u0027t going to speak even to myself - had explained to me was stronger than any other emotional tie, for a vampire.\\n\\n To my relief, the light shone green in the wall.\\n\\n Sigebert said, \"Go now,\" and pushed open the heavy door. He and Wybert gave me matching nods of farewell as I walked over the threshold and into a room that was like any executive\u0027s office anywhere.\\n\\n Sophie-Anne Leclerq, Queen of Louisiana, and a male vampire were sitting at a round table piled with papers. I\u0027d met the queen once before, when she\u0027d come to my place to tell me about my cousin\u0027s death. I hadn\u0027t noticed then how young she must have been when she died, maybe no more than fifteen. She was an elegant woman, perhaps four inches shorter than my height of five foot six, and she was groomed down to the last eyelash. Makeup, dress, hair, stockings, jewelry - the whole nine yards.\\n\\n The vampire at the table with her was her male counterpart. He wore a suit that would have paid my cable bill for a year, and he was barbered and manicured and scented until he almost wasn\u0027t a guy any more. In my neck of the woods, I didn\u0027t often see men so groomed. I guessed this was the new king. I wondered if he\u0027d died in such a state; actually, I wondered if the funeral home had cleaned him up like that for his funeral, not knowing that his descent below ground was only temporary. If that had been the case, he was younger than his queen. Maybe age wasn\u0027t the only requirement, if you were aiming to be royalty.\\n\\n There were two other people in the room. A short man stood about three feet behind the queen\u0027s chair, his legs apart, his hands clasped in front of him. He had close-cut white-blond hair and bright blue eyes. His face lacked maturity; he looked like a large child, but with a man\u0027s shoulders. He was wearing a suit, and he was armed with a saber and a gun.\\n\\n Behind the man at the table stood a woman, a vampire, dressed all in red; slacks, T-shirt, Converses. Her preference was unfortunate, because red was not her color. She was Asian, and I thought she\u0027d come from Vietnam - though it had probably been called something else then. She had very short unpainted nails, and a terrifying sword strapped to her back. Apparently, her hair had been cut off at chin length by a pair of rusty scissors. Her face was the unenhanced one God had given her.\\n\\n Since I hadn\u0027t had a briefing on the correct protocol, I dipped my head to the queen, said, \"Good to see you again, ma\u0027am,\" and tried to look pleasantly at the king while doing the head-dip thing again. The two standees, who must be aides or bodyguards, received smaller nods. I felt like an idiot, but I didn\u0027t want to ignore them. However, they didn\u0027t have a problem with ignoring me, once they\u0027d given me an all-over threat assessment.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve had some adventures in New Orleans,\" the queen said, a safe lead-in. She wasn\u0027t smiling, but then I had the impression she was not a smiley kind of gal.\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie, this is my husband. Peter Threadgill, King of Arkansas.\" There was not a trace of affection on her face. She might as well have been telling me the name of her pet cockapoo.\\n\\n \"How-de-do,\" I said, and repeated my head-bob, adding, \"Sir,\" hastily. Okay, already tired of this.\\n\\n \"Miss Stackhouse,\" he said, turning his attention back to the papers in front of him. The round table was large and completely cluttered with letters, computer printouts, and an assortment of other papers - bank statements?\\n\\n While I was relieved not to be an object of interest to the king, I was wondering exactly why I was there. I found out when the queen began to question me about the night before. I told her as explicitly as I could what had happened.\\n\\n She looked very serious when I talked about Amelia\u0027s stasis spell and what it had done to the body.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think the witch knew the body was there when she cast the spell?\" the queen asked. I noticed that though the king\u0027s gaze was on the papers in front of him, he hadn\u0027t moved a one of them since I\u0027d begun talking. Of course, maybe he was a very slow reader.\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. I know Amelia didn\u0027t know he was there.\"\\n\\n \"From your telepathic ability?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n Peter Threadgill looked at me then, and I saw that his eyes were an unusual glacial gray. His face was full of sharp angles: a nose like a blade, thin straight lips, high cheekbones.\\n\\n The king and the queen were both good-looking, but not in a way that struck any chord in me. I had an impression that the feeling was mutual. Thank God.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the telepath that my dear Sophie wants to bring to the conference,\" Peter Threadgill said.\\n\\n Since he was telling me something I already knew, I didn\u0027t feel the need to answer. But discretion won over sheer irritation. \"Yes, I am.\"\\n\\n \"Stan has one,\" the queen said to her husband, as if vampires collected telepaths the way dog fanciers collected springer spaniels.\\n\\n The only Stan I knew was a head vampire in Dallas, and the only other telepath I\u0027d ever met had lived there. From the queen\u0027s few words, I guessed that Barry the Bellman\u0027s life had changed a lot since I\u0027d met him. Apparently he worked for Stan Davis now. I didn\u0027t know if Stan was the sheriff or even a king, since at the time I hadn\u0027t been privy to the fact that vampires had such.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re now trying to match your entourage to Stan\u0027s?\" Peter Threadgill asked his wife, in a distinctly unfond kind of way. From the many clues thrown my way, I\u0027d gotten the picture that this wasn\u0027t a love match. If you asked me to cast a vote, I would say it wasn\u0027t even a lust match. I knew the queen had liked my cousin Hadley in a lusty way, and the two brothers on guard had said she\u0027d rocked their world. Peter Threadgill was nowhere near either side of that spectrum. But maybe that only proved the queen was omnisexual, if that was a word. I\u0027d have to look it up when I went home. If I ever got home.\\n\\n \"If Stan can see the advantage in employing such a person, I can certainly consider it - especially since one is easily available.\"\\n\\n I was in stock.\\n\\n The king shrugged. Not that I had formed many expectations, but I would have anticipated that the king of a nice, poor, scenic state like Arkansas would be less sophisticated and folksier, with a sense of humor. Maybe Threadgill was a carpetbagger from New York City. Vampire accents tended to be all over the map - literally - so it was impossible to tell from his speech.\\n\\n \"So what do you think happened in Hadley\u0027s apartment?\" the queen asked me, and I realized we\u0027d reverted to the original subject.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know who attacked Jake Purifoy,\" I said. \"But the night Hadley went to the graveyard with Waldo, Jake\u0027s drained body landed in her closet. As to how it came there, I couldn\u0027t say. That\u0027s why Amelia is having this ecto thing tonight.\"\\n\\n The queen\u0027s expression changed; she actually looked interested. \"She\u0027s having an ectoplasmic reconstruction? I\u0027ve heard of those, but never witnessed one.\"\\n\\n The king looked more than interested. For a split second, he looked extremely angry.\\n\\n I forced my attention back to the queen. \"Amelia wondered if you would care to, ah, fund it?\" I wondered if I should add, \"My lady,\" but I just couldn\u0027t bring myself to do it.\\n\\n \"That would be a good investment, since our newest vampire might have gotten us all into a great deal of trouble. If he had gotten loose on the populace... I will be glad to pay.\"\\n\\n I drew a breath of sheer relief.\\n\\n \"And I think I\u0027ll watch, too,\" the queen added, before I could even exhale.\\n\\n That sounded like the worst idea in the world. I thought the queen\u0027s presence would flatten Amelia until all the magic was squished out. However, there was no way I was going to tell the queen she was not welcome.\\n\\n Peter Threadgill had looked up sharply when the queen had announced she\u0027d watch. \"I don\u0027t think you should go,\" he said, his voice smooth and authoritative. \"It will be hard for the twins and Andre to guard you out in the city in a neighborhood like that.\"\\n\\n I wondered how the King of Arkansas had any idea what Hadley\u0027s neighborhood was like. Actually, it was a quiet, middle-class area, especially compared to the zoo that was vampire central headquarters, with its constant stream of tourists and picketers and fanatics with cameras.\\n\\n Sophie-Anne was already preparing to go out. That preparation consisted of glancing in a mirror to make sure the flawless facade was still flawless and sliding on her high, high heels, which had been below the edge of the table. She\u0027d been sitting there barefoot. That detail suddenly made Sophie-Anne Leclerq much more real to me. There was a personality under that glossy exterior.\\n\\n \"I suppose you would like Bill to accompany us,\" the queen said to me.\\n\\n \"No,\" I snapped. Okay, there was a personality - and it was unpleasant and cruel.\\n\\n But the queen looked genuinely startled. Her husband was outraged at my rudeness - his head shot up and his odd gray eyes fixed me with a luminous anger - but the queen was simply taken aback by my reaction. \"I thought you were a couple,\" she said, in a perfectly even voice.\\n\\n I bit back my first answer, trying to remember who I was talking to, and said, almost in a whisper, \"No, we are not.\" I took a deep breath and made a great effort. \"I apologize for being so abrupt. Please excuse me.\"\\n\\n The queen simply looked at me for a few seconds longer, and I still could not get the slightest indication of her thoughts, emotions, or intentions. It was like looking at an antique silver tray - a shining surface, an elaborate pattern, and hard to the touch. How Hadley could have been adventurous enough to bed this woman was simply beyond my comprehension.\\n\\n \"You are excused,\" she said finally.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too lenient,\" her husband said, and his surface, at least, began to thin somewhat. His lips curled in something closely approaching a snarl, and I discovered I didn\u0027t want to be the focus of those luminous eyes for another second. I didn\u0027t like the way the Asian gal in red was looking at me, either. And every time I looked at her haircut, it gave me the heebie-jeebies. Gosh, even the elderly lady who\u0027d given my gran a permanent three times a year would have done a better job than the Mad Weed Whacker.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be back in an hour or two, Peter,\" Sophie-Anne said, very precisely, in a tone that could have sliced a diamond. The short man, his childish face blank, was by her side in a jiffy, extending his arm so she could have his assistance in rising. I guessed he was Andre.\\n\\n The atmosphere was cuttable. Oh, I so wished I were somewhere else.\\n\\n \"I would feel more at ease if I knew Jade Flower was with you,\" the king said. He motioned toward the woman in red. Jade Flower, my ass: she looked more like Stone Killer. The Asian woman\u0027s face didn\u0027t change one iota at the king\u0027s offer.\\n\\n \"But that would leave you with no one,\" the queen said.\\n\\n \"Hardly true. The building is full of guards and loyal vampires,\" Peter Threadgill said.\\n\\n Okay, even I caught that one. The guards, who belonged to the queen, were separate from the loyal vampires, whom I guessed were the ones Peter had brought with him.\\n\\n \"Then, of course, I would be proud to have a fighter like Jade Flower accompany me.\"\\n\\n Yuck. I couldn\u0027t tell if the queen was serious, or trying to placate her new husband by accepting his offer, or laughing up her sleeve at his lame strategy to ensure that his spy was at the ectoplasmic reconstruction. The queen used the intercom to call down - or up, for all I knew - to the secure chamber where Jake Purifoy was being educated in the ways of the vampire. \"Keep extra guards on Purifoy,\" she said. \"And let me know the minute he remembers something.\" An obsequious voice assured Sophie-Anne that she\u0027d be the first to know.\\n\\n I wondered why Jake needed extra guards. I found it hard to get real concerned about his welfare, but obviously the queen was.\\n\\n So here we went - the queen, Jade Flower, Andre, Sigebert, Wybert, and me. I guess I\u0027ve been in company just as assorted, but I couldn\u0027t tell you when. After a lot of corridor tromping, we entered a guarded garage and piled into a stretch limo. Andre jerked his thumb at one of the guards, indicating that the guard should drive. I hadn\u0027t heard the baby-faced vampire utter a word, so far. To my pleasure, the driver was Rasul, who felt like an old friend compared to the others.\\n\\n Sigebert and Wybert were uncomfortable in the car. They were the most inflexible vampires I\u0027d ever met, and I wondered if their close association with the queen hadn\u0027t been their undoing. They hadn\u0027t had to change, and changing with the times was the key vampire survival technique before the Great Revelation. It remained so in countries that hadn\u0027t accepted the existence of vampire with the tolerance America had shown. The two vampires would have been happy wearing skins and hand-woven cloth and would have looked perfectly at home in handmade leather boots, carrying shields on their arms.\\n\\n \"Your sheriff, Eric, came to speak to me last night,\" the queen told me.\\n\\n \"I saw him at the hospital,\" I said, hoping I sounded equally offhanded.\\n\\n \"You understand that the new vampire, the one that was a Were - he had no choice, you understand?\"\\n\\n \"I get that a lot with vampires,\" I said, remembering all the times in the past when Bill had explained things by saying he couldn\u0027t help himself. I\u0027d believed him at the time, but I wasn\u0027t so sure any more. In fact, I was so profoundly tired and miserable I hardly had the heart to continue trying to wrap up Hadley\u0027s apartment and her estate and her affairs. I realized that if I went home to Bon Temps, leaving unfinished business here, I\u0027d just sit and brood when I got there.\\n\\n I knew this, but at the moment, it was hard to face.\\n\\n It was time for one of my self - pep talks. I told myself sternly I\u0027d already enjoyed a moment or two of that very evening, and I would enjoy a few more seconds of every day until I built back to my former contented state. I\u0027d always enjoyed life, and I knew I would again. But I was going to have to slog through a lot of bad patches to get there.\\n\\n I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been a person with a lot of illusions. If you can read minds, you don\u0027t have many doubts about how bad even the best people can be.\\n\\n But I sure hadn\u0027t seen this coming.\\n\\n To my horror, tears began sliding down my face. I reached into my little purse, pulled out a Kleenex, and patted my cheeks while all the vamps stared at me, Jade Flower with the most identifiable expression I\u0027d seen on her face: contempt.\\n\\n \"Are you in pain?\" the queen asked, indicating my arm.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t think she really cared; I was sure that she had schooled herself to give the correct human response for so long that it was a reflex.\\n\\n \"Pain of the heart,\" I said, and could have bitten my tongue off.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said. \"Bill?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, and gulped, doing my best to stop the display of emotion.\\n\\n \"I grieved for Hadley,\" she said unexpectedly.\\n\\n \"It was good she had someone to care.\" After a minute I said, \"I would have been glad to know she was dead earlier than I did,\" which was as cautiously as I could express it. I hadn\u0027t found out my cousin was gone until weeks after the fact.\\n\\n \"There were reasons I had to wait to send Cataliades down,\" Sophie-Anne said. Her smooth face and clear eyes were as impenetrable as a wall of ice, but I got the definite impression that she wished I hadn\u0027t raised the subject. I looked at the queen, trying to pick up on some clue, and she gave a tiny flick of the eye toward Jade Flower, who was sitting on her right. I didn\u0027t know how Jade Flower could be sitting in her relaxed position with the long sword strapped to her back. But I definitely had the feeling that behind her expressionless face and flat eyes, Jade Flower was listening to everything that transpired.\\n\\n To be on the safe side, I decided I wouldn\u0027t say anything at all, and the rest of the drive passed in silence.\\n\\n Rasul didn\u0027t want to take the limo into the courtyard, and I recalled that Diantha had parked on the street, too. Rasul came back to open the door for the queen, and Andre got out first, looked around for a long time, then nodded that it was safe for the queen to emerge. Rasul stood at the ready, rifle in his hands, sweeping the area visually for attackers. Andre was just as vigilant.\\n\\n Jade Flower slithered out of the backseat next and added her eyes to those scanning the area. Protecting the queen with their bodies, they moved into the courtyard. Sigebert got out next, ax in hand, and waited for me. After I\u0027d joined him on the sidewalk, he and Wybert took me through the open gateway with less ceremony than the others had taken the queen.\\n\\n I\u0027d seen the queen at my own home, unguarded by anyone but Cataliades. I\u0027d seen the queen in her own office, guarded by one person. I guess I didn\u0027t realize until that moment how important security was for Sophie-Anne, how precarious her hold on power must be. I wanted to know against whom all these guards were protecting her. Who wanted to kill the Louisiana queen? Maybe all vampire rulers were in this much danger - or maybe it was just Sophie-Anne. Suddenly the vampire conference in the fall seemed like a much scarier proposition than it had before.\\n\\n The courtyard was well lit, and Amelia was standing on the circular driveway with three friends. For the record, none of them were crones with broomsticks. One of them was a kid who looked just like a Mormon missionary: black pants, white shirt, dark tie, polished black shoes. There was a bicycle leaning up against the tree in the center of the circle. Maybe he was a Mormon missionary. He looked so young that I thought he might still be growing. The tall woman standing beside him was in her sixties, but she had a Bowflex body. She was wearing a tight T-shirt, knit slacks, sandals, and a pair of huge hoop earrings. The third witch was about my age, in her mid- to late twenties, and she was Hispanic. She had full cheeks, bright red lips, and rippling black hair, and she was short and had more curves than an S turn. Sigebert admired her especially (I could tell by his leer), but she ignored all the vampires as if she couldn\u0027t see them.\\n\\n Amelia might have been startled by the influx of vampires, but she handled introductions with aplomb. Evidently the queen had already identified herself before I approached. \"Your Majesty,\" Amelia was saying, \"These are my co-practitioners.\" She swept her hand before them as if she were showing off a car to the studio audience. \"Bob Jessup, Patsy Sellers, Terencia Rodriguez - Terry, we call her.\"\\n\\n The witches glanced at each other before nodding briefly to the queen. It was hard to tell how she took that lack of deference, her face was so glass-smooth - but she nodded back, and the atmosphere remained tolerable.\\n\\n \"We were just preparing for our reconstruction,\" Amelia said. She sounded absolutely confident, but I noticed that her hands were trembling. Her thoughts were not nearly as confident as her voice, either. Amelia was running over their preparations in her head, frantically itemizing the magic stuff she\u0027d assembled, anxiously reassessing her companions to satisfy herself they were up to the ritual, and so on. Amelia, I belatedly realized, was a perfectionist.\\n\\n I wondered where Claudine was. Maybe she\u0027d seen the vamps coming and prudently fled to some dark corner. While I was looking around for her, I had a moment when the heartache I was staving off just plain ambushed me. It was like the moments I had after my grandmother died, when I\u0027d be doing something familiar like brushing my teeth, and all of a sudden the blackness would overwhelm me. It took a moment or two to collect myself and swim back to the surface again.\\n\\n It would be like that for a while, and I\u0027d just have to grit my teeth and bear it.\\n\\n I made myself take notice of those around me. The witches had assumed their positions. Bob settled himself in a lawn chair in the courtyard, and I watched with a tiny flare of interest as he drew powdered stuff from little snack-size Ziploc bags and got a box of matches out of his chest pocket. Amelia bounded up the stairs to the apartment, Terry stationed herself halfway down the stairs, and the tall older witch, Patsy, was already standing on the gallery looking down at us.\\n\\n \"If you all want to watch, probably up here would be best,\" Amelia called, and the queen and I went up the stairs. The guards gathered in a clump by the gate so they\u0027d be as far away from the magic as they could be; even Jade Flower seemed respectful of the power that was about to be put to use, even if she did not respect the witches as people.\\n\\n As a matter of course, Andre followed the queen up the stairs, but I thought there was a less than enthusiastic droop to his shoulders.\\n\\n It was nice to focus on something new instead of mulling over my miseries, and I listened with interest as Amelia, who looked like she should be out playing beach volleyball, instead gave us instructions on the magic spell she was about to cast.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve set the time to two hours before I saw Jake arrive,\" she said. \"So you may see a lot of boring and extraneous stuff. If that gets old, I can try to speed up the events.\"\\n\\n Suddenly I had a thought that blinded me by its sheer serendipity. I would ask Amelia to return to Bon Temps with me, and there I would ask her to repeat this procedure in my yard; then I would know what had happened to poor Gladiola. I felt much better once I\u0027d had this idea, and I made myself pay attention to the here and now.\\n\\n Amelia called out \"Begin!\" and immediately began reciting words, I suppose in Latin. I heard a faint echo come up from the stairs and the courtyard as the other witches joined in.\\n\\n We didn\u0027t know what to expect, and it was oddly boring to hear the chanting continue after a couple of minutes. I began to wonder what would happen to me if the queen got very bored.\\n\\n Then my cousin Hadley walked into the living room.\\n\\n I was so shocked, I almost spoke to her. When I looked for just a second longer, I could tell it wasn\u0027t really Hadley. It had the shape of her, and it moved like her, but this simulacrum was only washed with color. Her hair was not a true dark, but a glistening impression of dark. She looked like tinted water, walking. You could see the surface\u0027s shimmer. I looked at her eagerly: it had been so long since we\u0027d seen each other. Hadley looked older, of course. She looked harder, too, with a sardonic set to her mouth and a skeptical look to her eyes.\\n\\n Oblivious to the presence of anyone else in the room, the reconstruction went over to the loveseat, picked up a phantom remote control, and turned on the television. I actually glanced at the screen to see if it would show anything, but of course, it didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I felt a movement beside me and I glanced at the queen. If I had been shocked, she was electrified. I had never really thought the queen could have truly loved Hadley, but I saw now that she had, as much as she was able.\\n\\n We watched Hadley glance at the television from time to time while she painted her toenails, drank a phantom glass of blood, and made a phone call. We couldn\u0027t hear her. We could only see, and that within a limited range. The object she reached for would appear the minute her hand touched it, but not before, so you could be sure of what she had only when she began to use it. When she leaned forward to replace the glass of blood on the table, and her hand was still holding the glass, we\u0027d see the glass, the table with its other objects, and Hadley, all at once, all with that glistening patina. The ghost table was imposed over the real table, which was still in almost exactly the same space as it had been that night, just to make it weirder. When Hadley let go of the glass, both glass and table winked out of existence.\\n\\n Andre\u0027s eyes were wide and staring when I glanced back at him, and it was the most expression I\u0027d seen on his face. If the queen was grieving and I was fascinated and sad, Andre was simply freaked out.\\n\\n We stood through a few more minutes of this until Hadley evidently heard a knock at the door. (Her head turned toward the door, and she looked surprised.) She rose (the phantom loveseat, perhaps two inches to the right of the real one, became nonexistent) and padded across the floor. She stepped through my sneakers, which were sitting side by side next to the loveseat.\\n\\n Okay, that was weird. This whole thing was weird, but fascinating.\\n\\n Presumably the people in the courtyard had watched the caller come up the outside stairs, since I heard a loud curse from one of the Berts - Wybert, I thought. When Hadley opened a phantom door, Patsy, who\u0027d been stationed outside on the gallery, pushed open the real door so we could see. From Amelia\u0027s chagrined face, I could tell she hadn\u0027t thought that one through ahead of time.\\n\\n Standing at the door was (phantom) Waldo, a vampire who had been with the queen for years. He had been much punished in the years before his death, and it had left him with permanently wrinkled skin. Since Waldo had been an ultrathin albino before this punishment, he\u0027d looked awful the one and only night I\u0027d known him. As a watery ghost creature, he looked better, actually.\\n\\n Hadley looked surprised to see him. That expression was strong enough to be easily recognizable. Then she looked disgusted. But she stepped back to let him in.\\n\\n When she strolled back to the table to pick up her glass, Waldo glanced around him, as if to see if anyone else was there. The temptation to warn Hadley was so strong it was almost irresistible.\\n\\n After some conversation, which of course we couldn\u0027t understand, Hadley shrugged and seemed to agree to some plan. Presumably, this was the idea Waldo had told me about the night he\u0027d confessed to killing my cousin. He\u0027d said it had been Hadley\u0027s idea to go to St. Louis Cemetery Number One to raise the ghost of voodooienne Marie Laveau, but from this evidence it seemed Waldo was the one who had suggested the excursion.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that in his hand?\" Amelia said, as quietly as she could, and Patsy stepped in from the gallery to check.\\n\\n \"Brochure,\" she called to Amelia, trying to use equally hushed tones. \"About Marie Laveau.\"\\n\\n Hadley looked at the watch on her wrist and said something to Waldo. It was something unkind, judging by Hadley\u0027s expression and the jerk of her head as she indicated the door. She was saying \"No,\" as clearly as body language could say it.\\n\\n And yet the next night she had gone with him. What had happened to change her mind?\\n\\n Hadley walked back to her bedroom and we followed her. Looking back, we watched Waldo leave the apartment, putting the brochure on the table by the door as he departed.\\n\\n It felt oddly voyeuristic to stand in Hadley\u0027s bedroom with Amelia, the queen, and Andre, watching Hadley take off a bathrobe and put on a very fancy dress.\\n\\n \"She wore that to the party the night before the wedding,\" the queen said quietly. It was a skintight, cut-down-to-here red dress decked with darker red sequins and some gorgeous alligator pumps. Hadley was going to make the queen regret what she was losing, evidently.\\n\\n We watched Hadley primp in the mirror, do her hair two different ways, and mull her choice of lipsticks for a very long time. The novelty was wearing off the process, and I was willing to fast-forward, but the queen just couldn\u0027t get enough of seeing her beloved again. I sure wasn\u0027t going to protest, especially since the queen was footing the bill.\\n\\n Hadley turned back and forth in front of her full-length mirror, appeared satisfied with what she saw, then burst into tears.\\n\\n \"Oh, my dear,\" the queen said quietly. \"I am so sorry.\"\\n\\n I knew exactly how Hadley felt, and for the first time I felt the kinship with my cousin I\u0027d lost through the years of separation. In this reconstruction, it was the night before the queen\u0027s wedding, and Hadley was going to have to go to a party and watch the queen and her fiance be a couple. And the next night she would have to attend their wedding; or so she thought. She didn\u0027t know that she\u0027d be dead by then; finally, definitely dead.\\n\\n \"Someone coming up,\" called Bob the witch. His voice wafted through the open French windows onto the gallery. In the phantom, ghostly world, the doorbell must have rung, because Hadley stiffened, gave herself a last look in the mirror (right through us, since we were standing in front of it) and visibly braced herself. When Hadley walked down the hall, she had a familiar sway to her hips and her watery face was set in a cold half smile.\\n\\n She pulled open the door. Since the witch Patsy had left the actual door open after Waldo had \"arrived,\" we could see this happening. Jake Purifoy was dressed in a tux, and he looked very good, as Amelia had said. I glanced at Amelia when he stepped into the apartment, and she was eyeing the phantasm regretfully.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t care for being sent to pick up the queen\u0027s honeybun, you could tell, but he was too politic and too courteous to take that out on Hadley. He stood patiently while she got a tiny purse and gave her hair a final combing, and then the two were out the door.\\n\\n \"Coming down out there,\" Bob called, and we went out the door and across the gallery to look over the railing. The two phantoms were getting into a glistening car and driving out of the courtyard. That was where the area affected by the spell came to an end. As the ghost car passed through the gate area, it winked out of existence right by the group of vampires who were clustered by the opening. Sigebert and Wybert were wide-eyed and solemn, Jade Flower appeared disgruntled, and Rasul looked faintly amused, as if he were thinking of the good stories he\u0027d have to tell in the guards\u0027 mess hall.\\n\\n \"Time to fast-forward,\" Amelia called. She was looking tired now, and I wondered how great a strain coordinating this act of witchcraft was placing on the young witch.\\n\\n Patsy, Terry, Bob, and Amelia began to say another spell in unison. If there was a weak link in this team effort, it was Terry. The round-faced little witch was sweating profusely and shaking with the effort of keeping her magical end up. I felt a little worried as I saw the strain on her face.\\n\\n \"Take it easy, easy!\" Amelia exhorted her team, having read the same signs. Then they all resumed chanting, and Terry seemed to be pacing herself a bit better; she didn\u0027t look so desperate.\\n\\n Amelia said, \"Slow... down... now,\" and the chanting eased its pace.\\n\\n The car appeared again in the gate, this time running right through Sigebert, who\u0027d taken a step forward, the better to watch Terry, I suspected. It lurched to an abrupt stop half-in, half-out of the aperture.\\n\\n Hadley threw herself out of the car. She was weeping, and from the looks of her face, she\u0027d been weeping for some time. Jake Purifoy emerged from his side and stood there, his hands on the top of his door, talking across the roof of the car at Hadley.\\n\\n For the first time, the queen\u0027s personal bodyguard spoke. Andre said, \"Hadley, you have to cut this out. People will notice, and the new king will do something about it. He\u0027s the jealous kind, you know? He doesn\u0027t care about - \" Here Andre lost the thread, and shook his head. \"He cares about keeping face.\"\\n\\n We all stared at him. Was he channeling?\\n\\n The queen\u0027s bodyguard switched his gaze to the ectoplasmic Hadley. Andre said, \"But Jake, I can\u0027t stand it. I know she has to do this politically, but she\u0027s sending me away! I can\u0027t take it.\"\\n\\n Andre could read lips. Even ectoplasmic lips. He began speaking again.\\n\\n \"Hadley, go up and sleep on it. You can\u0027t go to the wedding if you\u0027re going to create a scene. You know that would embarrass the queen, and it would ruin the ceremony. My boss will kill me if that happens. This is the biggest event we\u0027ve ever worked.\"\\n\\n He was talking about Quinn, I realized. Jake Purifoy was the employee Quinn had told me was missing.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t stand it,\" Hadley repeated. She was shrieking, I could tell from the way her mouth moved, but luckily Andre saw no need to imitate that. It was eerie enough hearing the words come out of his mouth. \"I\u0027ve done something terrible!\" The melodramatic words sounded very strange in Andre\u0027s monotone.\\n\\n Hadley ran up the stairs, and Terry automatically moved out of the way to let her pass. Hadley unlocked the (already open) door and stormed into her apartment. We turned to watch Jake. Jake sighed, straightened up, and stepped away from the car, which vanished. He flipped open a cell phone and punched in a number. He spoke into the phone for less than a minute, with no pause for an answer, so it was safe to assume he\u0027d gotten voice mail.\\n\\n Andre said, \"Boss, I have to tell you I think there\u0027s going to be trouble. The girlfriend won\u0027t be able to control herself on the day.\"\\n\\n Oh my God, tell me Quinn didn\u0027t have Hadley killed! I thought, feeling absolutely sick at the thought. But even as the idea formed fully, Jake wandered over to the rear of the car, which appeared again as he brushed against it. He ran his hand lovingly along the line of the trunk, stepping closer and closer to the area outside the gate, and suddenly a hand reached out and grabbed him. The witches\u0027 area did not extend beyond the walls, so the rest of the body was absent, and the effect of a hand materializing from nowhere and seizing the unsuspecting Were was as scary as anything in a horror movie.\\n\\n This was exactly like one of those dreams where you see danger approaching, but you can\u0027t speak. No warnings on our part could alter what had already happened. But we were all shocked. The brothers Bert cried out, Jade Flower drew her sword without my even seeing her hand move, and the queen\u0027s mouth fell open.\\n\\n We could see only Jake\u0027s feet, thrashing. Then they lay still.\\n\\n We all stood and looked at each other, even the witches, their concentration wavering until the courtyard began to fill with mist.\\n\\n \"Witches!\" Amelia called harshly. \"Back to work!\" In a moment, everything had cleared up. But Jake\u0027s feet were still, and in a moment, their outline grew still more faint; he was fading out of sight like all the other lifeless objects. In a few seconds, though, my cousin appeared on the gallery above, looking down. Her expression was cautious and worried. She\u0027d heard something. We registered the moment when she saw the body, and she came down the stairs with vampiric speed. She leaped through the gate and was lost to sight, but in a moment she was back in, dragging the body by the feet. As long as she was touching it, the body was visible as a table or chair would have been. Then she bent over the corpse, and now we could see that Jake had a huge wound in his neck. The wound was sickening, though I have to say that the vamps watching did not look sickened, but enthralled.\\n\\n Ectoplasmic Hadley looked around her, hoping for help that didn\u0027t come. She looked desperately uncertain. Her fingers never left Jake\u0027s neck as she felt for his pulse.\\n\\n Finally she bent over him and said something to him.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the only way,\" Andre translated. \"You may hate me, but it\u0027s the only way.\" We watched Hadley tear at her wrist with her own fangs and then put her bleeding wrist to Jake\u0027s mouth, watched the blood trickle inside, watched him revive enough to grip her arms and pull her down to him. When Hadley made Jake let go of her, she looked exhausted, and he looked as if he were having convulsions.\\n\\n \"The Were does not make a good vampire,\" Sigebert said in a whisper. \"I\u0027ve never before seen a Were brought over.\"\\n\\n It was sure hard for poor Jake Purifoy. I began to forgive him the horror of the evening before, seeing his suffering. My cousin Hadley gathered him up and carried him up the stairs, pausing every now and then to look around her. I followed her up one more time, the queen right behind me. We watched Hadley pull off Jake\u0027s ripped clothes, wrap a towel around his neck until the bleeding stopped, and stow him in the closet, carefully covering him and closing the door so the morning sun wouldn\u0027t burn the new vampire, who would have to lie in the dark for three days. Hadley crammed the bloody towel into her hamper. Then she stuffed another towel into the open space at the bottom of the door, to make sure Jake was safe.\\n\\n Then she sat in the hall and thought. Finally she got her cell phone and called a number.\\n\\n \"She asks for Waldo,\" Andre said. When Hadley\u0027s lips began moving again, Andre said, \"She makes the appointment for the next night. She says she must talk to the ghost of Marie Laveau, if the ghost will really come. She needs advice, she says.\" After a little more conversation, Hadley shut her phone and got up. She gathered up the former Were\u0027s torn and bloody clothing and sealed it in a bag.\\n\\n \"You should get the towel, too,\" I advised, in a whisper, but my cousin left it in the hamper for me to find when I arrived. Hadley got the car keys out of the trouser pockets, and when she went down the stairs, she got into the car and drove away with the garbage bag. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-17.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) \\n As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
