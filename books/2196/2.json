{"id":101249,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"It was close to closing time the next night when another odd thing happened. Just as Sam gave us the signal to start telling our customers this would be their last drink, someone I thought I\u0027d never see again came into Merlotte\u0027s.\n He moved quietly for such a large man. He stood just inside the door, looking around for a free table, and I noticed him because of the quick gleam of the dim bar light on his shaven head. He was very tall, and very wide, with a proud nose and big white teeth. He had full lips and an olive complexion, and he was wearing a sort of bronze sports jacket over a black shirt and slacks. Though he would have looked more natural in motorcycle boots, he was wearing polished loafers.\n \"Quinn,\" Sam said quietly. His hands became still, though he\u0027d been in the middle of mixing a Tom Collins. \"What is he doing here?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know you knew him,\" I said, feeling my face flush as I realized I\u0027d been thinking about the bald man only the day before. He\u0027d been the one who\u0027d cleaned the blood from my leg with his tongue - an interesting experience.\n \"Everyone in my world knows Quinn,\" Sam said, his face neutral. \"But I\u0027m surprised you\u0027ve met him, since you\u0027re not a shifter.\" Unlike Quinn, Sam\u0027s not a big man; but he\u0027s very strong, as shifters tend to be, and his curly red-gold hair haloes his head in an angelic way.\n \"I met Quinn at the contest for packmaster,\" I said. \"He was the, ah, emcee.\" Naturally, Sam and I had talked about the change of leadership in the Shreveport pack. Shreveport isn\u0027t too far from Bon Temps, and what the Weres do is pretty important if you\u0027re any kind of a shifter.\n A true shape-shifter, like Sam, can change into anything, though each shape-shifter has a favorite animal. And to confuse the issue, all those who can change from human form to animal form call themselves shape-shifters, though very few possess Sam\u0027s versatility. Shifters who can change to only one animal are were-animals: weretigers (like Quinn), werebears, werewolves. The wolves are the only ones who call themselves simply Weres, and they consider themselves superior in toughness and culture to any of the other shape-shifters.\n Weres are also the most numerous subset of shifters, though compared to the total vampire population, there are mighty few of them. There are several reasons for this. The Were birthrate is low, infant mortality is higher than in the general population of humans, and only the first child born of a pure Were couple becomes a full Were. That happens during puberty - as if puberty weren\u0027t bad enough already.\n Shape-shifters are very secretive. It\u0027s a hard habit to break, even around a sympathetic and strange human like me. The shifters have not come into the public view yet, and I\u0027m learning about their world in little increments.\n Even Sam has many secrets that I don\u0027t know, and I count him as a friend. Sam turns into a collie, and he often visits me in that form. (Sometimes he sleeps on the rug by my bed.)\n I\u0027d only seen Quinn in his human form.\n I hadn\u0027t mentioned Quinn when I told Sam about the fight between Jackson Herveaux and Patrick Furnan for the Shreveport pack leadership. Sam was frowning at me now, displeased that I\u0027d kept it from him, but I hadn\u0027t done it purposely. I glanced back at Quinn. He\u0027d lifted his nose a little. He was sampling the air, following a scent. Who was he trailing?\n When Quinn went unerringly to a table in my section, despite the many empty ones in the closer section that Arlene was working, I knew he was trailing me.\n Okay, mixed feelings on that.\n I glanced sideways at Sam to get his reaction. I had trusted him for five years now, and he had never failed me.\n Now Sam nodded at me. He didn\u0027t look happy, though. \"Go see what he wants,\" he said, his voice so low it was almost a growl.\n I got more and more nervous the closer I came to the new customer. I could feel my cheeks redden. Why was I getting so flustered?\n \"Hello, Mr. Quinn,\" I said. It would be stupid to pretend I didn\u0027t recognize him. \"What can I get you? I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re about to close, but I have time to serve you a beer or a drink.\"\n He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, as if he were inhaling me. \"I\u0027d recognize you in a pitch-black room,\" he said, and he smiled at me. It was a broad and beautiful smile.\n I looked off in another direction, pinching back the involuntary grin that rose to my lips. I was acting sort of... shy.\n I never acted shy. Or maybe coy would be a better term, and one I disliked. \"I guess I should say thank you,\" I ventured cautiously. \"That\u0027s a compliment?\"\n \"Intended as one. Who\u0027s the dog behind the bar who\u0027s giving me the stay-away look?\"\n He meant dog as a statement of fact, not as a derogatory term.\n \"That\u0027s my boss, Sam Merlotte.\"\n \"He has an interest in you.\"\n \"I should hope so. I\u0027ve worked for him for round about five years.\"\n \"Hmmm. How about a beer?\"\n \"Sure. What kind?\"\n \"Bud.\"\n \"Coming right up,\" I said, and turned to go. I knew he watched me all the way to the bar because I could feel his gaze. And I knew from his mind, though his was a closely guarded shifter mind, that he was watching me with admiration.\n \"What does he want?\" Sam looked almost... bristly. If he\u0027d been in dog form, the hair on his back would have been standing up.\n \"A Bud,\" I said.\n Sam scowled at me. \"That\u0027s not what I meant, and you know it.\"\n I shrugged. I had no idea what Quinn wanted.\n Sam slammed the full glass down on the bar right by my fingers, making me jump. I gave him a steady look to make sure he noted that I\u0027d been displeased, and then I took the beer to Quinn.\n Quinn gave me the cost of the beer and a good tip - not a ridiculously high one, which would have made me feel bought - which I slipped into my pocket. I began making the rounds of my other tables. \"You visiting someone in this area?\" I asked Quinn as I passed him on my way back from clearing another table. Most of the patrons were paying up and drifting out of Merlotte\u0027s. There was an afterhours place that Sam pretended he didn\u0027t know about, way out in the country, but most of the Merlotte\u0027s regulars would be going home to bed. If a bar could be family-oriented, Merlotte\u0027s was.\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"You.\"\n That left me with nowhere to go, conversationally.\n I kept on going and unloaded the glasses from my tray so absently that I almost dropped one. I couldn\u0027t think of when I\u0027d been so flustered.\n \"Business or personal?\" I asked, the next time I was close.\n \"Both,\" he said.\n A little of the pleasure drained away when I heard about the business part, but I was left with a sharpened attention... and that was a good thing. You needed all your wits honed when you dealt with the supes. Supernatural beings had goals and desires that regular people didn\u0027t fathom. I knew that, since for my entire life I have been the unwilling repository for human, \"normal,\" goals and desires.\n When Quinn was one of the few people left in the bar - besides the other barmaids and Sam - he stood and looked at me expectantly. I went over, smiling brightly, as I do when I\u0027m tense. I was interested to find that Quinn was almost equally tense. I could feel the tightness in his brain pattern.\n \"I\u0027ll see you at your house, if that\u0027s agreeable to you.\" He looked down at me seriously. \"If that makes you nervous, we can meet somewhere else. But I want to talk to you tonight, unless you\u0027re exhausted.\"\n That had been put politely enough. Arlene and Danielle were trying hard not to stare - well, they were trying hard to stare when Quinn wouldn\u0027t catch them - but Sam had turned his back to fiddle around with something behind the bar, ignoring the other shifter. He was behaving very badly.\n Quickly I processed Quinn\u0027s request. If he came out to my house, I\u0027d be at his mercy. I live in a remote place. My nearest neighbor is my ex, Bill, and he lives clear across the cemetery. On the other hand, if Quinn had been a regular date of mine, I\u0027d let him take me home without a second thought. From what I could catch from his thoughts, he meant me no harm.\n \"All right,\" I said, finally. He relaxed, and smiled his big smile at me again.\n I whisked his empty glass away and became aware that three pairs of eyes were watching me disapprovingly. Sam was disgruntled, and Danielle and Arlene couldn\u0027t understand why anyone would prefer me to them, though Quinn gave even those two experienced barmaids pause. Quinn gave off a whiff of otherness that must be perceptible to even the most prosaic human. \"I\u0027ll be through in just a minute,\" I said.\n \"Take your time.\"\n I finished filling the little china rectangle on each table with packages of sugar and sweetener. I made sure the napkin holders were full and checked the salt and pepper shakers. I was soon through. I gathered my purse from Sam\u0027s office and called good-bye to him.\n Quinn pulled out to follow me in a dark green pickup truck. Under the parking lot lights, the truck looked brand spanking new, with gleaming tires and hubcaps, an extended cab, and a covered bed. I\u0027d bet good money it was loaded with options. Quinn\u0027s truck was the fanciest vehicle I\u0027d seen in a long time. My brother, Jason, would have drooled, and he\u0027s got pink and aqua swirls painted on the side of his truck.\n I drove south on Hummingbird Road and turned left into my driveway. After following the drive through two acres of woods, I reached the clearing where our old family home stood. I\u0027d turned the outside lights on before I left, and there was a security light on the electric pole that was automatic, so the clearing was well lit. I pulled around back to park behind the house, and Quinn parked right beside me.\n He got out of his truck and looked around him. The security light showed him a tidy yard. The driveway was in excellent repair, and I\u0027d recently repainted the tool shed in the back. There was a propane tank, which no amount of landscaping could disguise, but my grandmother had planted plenty of flower beds to add to the ones my family had established over the hundred-and-fifty-odd years the family had lived here. I\u0027d lived on this land, in this house, from age seven, and I loved it.\n There\u0027s nothing grand about my home. It started out as a family farmhouse and it\u0027s been enlarged and remodeled over the years. I keep it clean, and I try to keep the yard in good trim. Big repairs are beyond my skills, but Jason sometimes helps me out. He hadn\u0027t been happy when Gran left me the house and land, but he\u0027d moved to our parents\u0027 house when he\u0027d turned twenty-one, and I\u0027d never made him pay me for my half of that property. Gran\u0027s will had seemed fair to me. It had taken Jason a while to admit that had been the right thing for her to do.\n We\u0027d become closer in the past few months.\n I unlocked the back door and led Quinn into the kitchen. He looked around him curiously as I hung my jacket on one of the chairs pushed under the table in the middle of the kitchen where I ate all my meals.\n \"This isn\u0027t finished,\" Quinn said.\n The cabinets were resting on the floor, ready to be mounted. After that, the whole room would have to be painted and the countertops installed. Then I\u0027d be able to rest easy.\n \"My old kitchen got burned down a few weeks ago.\"\n I said. \"The builder had a cancellation and got this done in record time, but then when the cabinets didn\u0027t arrive on time, he put his crew on another job. By the time the cabinets got here, they were almost through there. I guess they\u0027ll come back eventually.\" In the meantime, at least I could enjoy being back in my own home. Sam had been tremendously kind in letting me live in one of his rent houses (and gosh, I\u0027d enjoyed the level floors and the new plumbing and the neighbors), but there was nothing like being home.\n The new stove was in, so I could cook, and I\u0027d laid a sheet of plywood over the top of the cabinets so I could use it as a work station while I was cooking. The new refrigerator gleamed and hummed quietly, quite unlike the one Gran had had for thirty years. The newness of the kitchen struck me every time I crossed the back porch - now larger and enclosed - to unlock the new, heavier back door, with its peephole and deadbolt.\n \"This is where the old house begins,\" I said, going from the kitchen into the hall. Only a few boards had had to be replaced in the floor in the rest of the house, and everything was freshly cleaned and painted. Not only had the walls and ceilings been smoke-stained, but I\u0027d had to eradicate the burned smell. I\u0027d replaced some curtains, tossed out a throw rug or two, and cleaned, cleaned, cleaned. This project had occupied every extra waking moment I\u0027d had for quite a while.\n \"A good job,\" Quinn commented, studying how the two parts had been united.\n \"Come into the living room,\" I said, pleased. I enjoyed showing someone the house now that I knew the upholstery was clean, there were no dust bunnies, and the glass over the pictures was simply gleaming. The living room curtains had been replaced, something I\u0027d wanted to do for at least a year.\n God bless insurance, and God bless the money I\u0027d earned hiding Eric from an enemy. I\u0027d gouged a hole in my savings account, but I\u0027d had it when I needed it, and that was something for which I could be grateful.\n The fireplace was laid ready for a fire, but it was just too warm to justify lighting one. Quinn sat in an armchair, and I sat across from him. \"Can I get you a drink - a beer, or some coffee or iced tea?\" I asked, conscious of my role as hostess.\n \"No, thanks,\" he said. He smiled at me. \"I\u0027ve wanted to see you again since I met you in Shreveport.\"\n I tried to keep my eyes on him. The impulse to look down at my feet or my hands was almost overwhelming. His eyes really were the deep, deep purple I remembered. \"That was a tough day for the Herveauxes,\" I said.\n \"You dated Alcide for a while,\" he observed, in a neutral kind of voice.\n I thought of a couple of possible answers. I settled for, \"I haven\u0027t seen him since the packmaster contest.\"\n He smiled widely. \"So he\u0027s not your steady?\"\n I shook my head.\n \"Then you\u0027re unattached?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"No toes I\u0027d be stepping on?\"\n I tried to smile, but my effort was not a happy one. \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" There were toes. Those toes wouldn\u0027t be happy piggies. But they didn\u0027t have any right to be in the way.\n \"I guess I can handle some disgruntled exes. So will you go out with me?\"\n I looked at him for a second or two, scouring my mind for considerations. From his brain I was getting nothing but hopefulness: I saw no deceit or self-serving. When I examined the reservations I had, they dissolved into nothing.\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"I will.\" His beautiful white smile sparked me to smile in return, and this time my smile was genuine.\n \"There,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve negotiated the pleasure part. Now for the business part, which is unrelated.\"\n \"Okay,\" I said, and put my smile away. I hoped I\u0027d have occasion to haul it out later, but any business he would have with me would be supe-related, and therefore cause for anxiety.\n \"You\u0027ve heard about the regional summit?\"\n The vampire summit: the kings and queens from a group of states would gather to confer about... vampire stuff. \"Eric said something about it.\"\n \"Has he hired you to work there yet?\"\n \"He mentioned he might need me.\"\n \"Because the Queen of Louisiana found out I was in the area, and she asked me to request your services. I think her bid would have to cancel out Eric\u0027s.\"\n \"You\u0027d have to ask Eric about that.\"\n \"I think you would have to tell him. The queen\u0027s wishes are Eric\u0027s orders.\"\n I could feel my face fall. I didn\u0027t want to tell Eric, the sheriff of Louisiana\u0027s Area Five, anything. Eric\u0027s feelings for me were confused. I can assure you, vamps don\u0027t like feeling confused. The sheriff had lost his memory of the short time he\u0027d spent hiding in my house. That memory gap had driven Eric nuts; he liked being in control, and that meant being cognizant of his own actions every second of the night. So he\u0027d waited until he could perform an action on my behalf, and as payment for that action he\u0027d demanded my account of what had passed while he stayed with me.\n Maybe I\u0027d carried the frankness thing a little too far. Eric wasn\u0027t exactly surprised that we\u0027d had sex; but he was stunned when I told him he\u0027d offered to give up his hard-won position in the vampire hierarchy and to come live with me.\n If you knew Eric, you\u0027d know that was pretty much intolerable to him.\n He didn\u0027t talk to me any more. He stared at me when we met, as if he were trying to resurrect his own memories of that time, to prove me wrong. It made me sad to see that the relationship we\u0027d had - not the secret happiness of the few days he\u0027d spent with me, but the entertaining relationship between a man and a woman who had little in common but a sense of humor - didn\u0027t seem to exist any more.\n I knew it was up to me to tell him that his queen had superseded him, but I sure didn\u0027t want to.\n \"Smile\u0027s all gone,\" Quinn observed. He looked serious himself.\n \"Well, Eric is a...\" I didn\u0027t know how to finish the sentence. \"He\u0027s a complicated guy,\" I said lamely.\n \"What shall we do on our first date?\" Quinn asked. So he was a good subject changer.\n \"We could go to the movies,\" I said, to start the ball rolling.\n \"We could. Afterward, we could have dinner in Shreveport. Maybe Ralph and Kacoo\u0027s,\" he suggested.\n \"I hear their crawfish etouffee is good,\" I said, keeping the conversational ball rolling.\n \"And who doesn\u0027t like crawfish etouffee? Or we could go bowling.\"\n My great-uncle had been an avid bowler. I could see his feet, in their bowling shoes, right in front of me. I shuddered. \"Don\u0027t know how.\"\n \"We could go to a hockey game.\"\n \"That might be fun.\"\n \"We could cook together in your kitchen, and then watch a movie on your DVD.\"\n \"Better put that one on a back burner.\" That sounded a little too personal for a first date, not that I\u0027ve had that much experience with first dates. But I know that proximity to a bedroom is never a good idea unless you\u0027re sure you wouldn\u0027t mind if the flow of the evening took you in that direction.\n \"We could go see The Producers. That\u0027s coming to the Strand.\"\n \"Really?\" Okay, I was excited now. Shreveport\u0027s restored Strand Theater hosted traveling stage productions ranging from plays to ballet. I\u0027d never seen a real play before. Wouldn\u0027t that be awfully expensive? Surely he wouldn\u0027t have suggested it if he couldn\u0027t afford it. \"Could we?\"\n He nodded, pleased at my reaction. \"I can make the reservations for this weekend. What about your work schedule?\"\n \"I\u0027m off Friday night,\" I said happily. \"And, um, I\u0027ll be glad to chip in for my ticket.\"\n \"I invited you. My treat,\" Quinn said firmly. I could read from his thoughts that he thought it was surprising that I had offered. And touching. Hmmm. I didn\u0027t like that. \"Okay then. It\u0027s settled. When I get back to my laptop, I\u0027ll order the tickets online. I know there are some good ones left, because I was checking out our options before I drove over.\"\n Naturally, I began to wonder about appropriate clothes. But I stowed that away for later. \"Quinn, where do you actually live?\"\n \"I have a house outside Memphis.\"\n \"Oh,\" I said, thinking that seemed a long way away for a dating relationship.\n \"I\u0027m partner in a company called Special Events. We\u0027re a sort of secret offshoot of Extreme(ly Elegant) Events. You\u0027ve seen the logo, I know. E(E)E?\" He made the parentheses with his fingers. I nodded. E(E)E did a lot of very fancy event designing nationally. \"There are four partners who work full-time for Special Events, and we each employ a few people full- or part-time. Since we travel a lot, we have places we use all over the country; some of them are just rooms in houses of friends or associates, and some of them are real apartments. The place I stay in this area is in Shreveport, a guesthouse in back of the mansion of a shifter.\"\n I\u0027d learned a lot about him in two minutes flat. \"So you put on events in the supernatural world, like the contest for packmaster.\" That had been a dangerous job and one requiring a lot of specialized paraphernalia. \"But what else is there to do? A packmaster\u0027s contest can only come up every so now and then. How much do you have to travel? What other special events can you stage?\"\n \"I generally handle the Southeast, Georgia across to Texas.\" He sat forward in his chair, his big hands resting on his knees. \"Tennessee south through Florida. In those states, if you want to stage a fight for packmaster, or a rite of ascension for a shaman or witch, or a vampire hierarchal wedding - and you want to do it right, with all the trimmings - you come to me.\"\n I remembered the extraordinary pictures in Alfred Cumberland\u0027s photo gallery. \"So there\u0027s enough of that to keep you busy?\"\n \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"Of course, some of it is seasonal. Vamps get married in the winter, since the nights are so much longer. I did a hierarchal wedding in New Orleans in January, this past year. And then, some of the occasions are tied to the Wiccan calendar. Or to puberty.\"\n I couldn\u0027t begin to imagine the ceremonies he arranged, but a description would have to wait for another occasion. \"And you have three partners who do this full-time, too? I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m just grilling you, seems like. But this is such an interesting way to make a living.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you think so. You gotta have a lot of people skills, and you gotta have a mind for details and organization.\"\n \"You have to be really, really, tough,\" I murmured, adding my own thought.\n He smiled, a slow smile. \"No problem there.\"\n Yep, didn\u0027t seem as though toughness was a problem for Quinn.\n \"And you have to be good at sizing up people, so you can steer clients in the right direction, leave them happy with the job you\u0027ve done,\" he said.\n \"Can you tell me some stories? Or is there a client confidentiality clause with your jobs?\"\n \"Customers sign a contract, but none of them have ever requested a confidentiality clause,\" he said. \"Special Events, you don\u0027t get much chance to talk about what you do, obviously, since the clients are mostly still traveling beneath the surface of the regular world. It\u0027s actually kind of a relief to talk about it. I usually have to tell a girl I\u0027m a consultant, or something bogus like that.\"\n \"It\u0027s a relief to me, too, to be able to talk without worrying I\u0027m spilling secrets.\"\n \"Then it\u0027s lucky we found each other, huh?\" Again, the white grin. \"I\u0027d better let you get some rest, since you just got off work.\" Quinn got up and stretched after he\u0027d reached his full height. It was an impressive gesture on someone as muscular as he was. It was just possible Quinn knew how excellent he looked when he stretched. I glanced down to hide my smile. I didn\u0027t mind one bit that he wanted to impress me.\n He reached for my hand and pulled me to my feet in one easy motion. I could feel his focus centered on me. His own hand was warm and hard. He could crack my bones with it.\n The average woman would not be pondering how fast her date could kill her, but I\u0027ll never be an average woman. I\u0027d realized that by the time I became old enough to understand that not every child could understand what her family members were thinking about her. Not every little girl knew when her teachers liked her, or felt contempt for her, or compared her to her brother (Jason had an easy charm even then). Not every little girl had a funny uncle who tried to get her alone at every family gathering.\n So I let Quinn hold my hand, and I looked up into his pansy-purple eyes, and for a minute I indulged myself by letting his admiration wash over me like a bath of approval.\n Yes, I knew he was a tiger. And I don\u0027t mean in bed, though I was willing to believe he was ferocious and powerful there, too.\n When he kissed me good night, his lips brushed my cheek, and I smiled.\n I like a man who knows when to rush things... and when not to. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-2.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) \n As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
