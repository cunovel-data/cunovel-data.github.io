{"id":101268,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Amelia was rummaging through her walk-in closet. It was just after dark the next day. Suddenly the hangers quit sliding across the rack at the very back of the closet.\\n\\n \"I think I have one,\" she called, sounding surprised. I waited for her to emerge, sitting on the edge of her bed. I\u0027d had at least ten hours\u0027 sleep, I\u0027d had a careful shower, I\u0027d had some first aid, and I felt a hundred times better. Amelia was glowing with pride and happiness. Not only had Bob the Mormony witch been wonderful in bed, they\u0027d been up in time to watch Quinn\u0027s and my abduction, and to have the brilliant idea of calling the vampire queen\u0027s mansion instead of the regular police. I hadn\u0027t told her yet that Quinn and I had made our own call, because I didn\u0027t know which one had been more effective, and I enjoyed seeing Amelia so happy.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t wanted to go to the queen\u0027s shindig at all until after my trip to the bank with Mr. Cataliades. After I\u0027d returned to Hadley\u0027s apartment, I\u0027d resumed packing my cousin\u0027s stuff and heard a strange noise when I\u0027d put the coffee into a box. Now if I wanted to avert disaster, I had to go to the queen\u0027s spring party, the supernatural event of the year. I\u0027d tried getting in touch with Andre at the queen\u0027s headquarters, but a voice had told me he was not to be disturbed. I wondered who was answering the phones at Vampire Central that day. Could it be one of Peter Threadgill\u0027s vamps?\\n\\n \"Yes, I do!\" Amelia exclaimed. \"Ah, it\u0027s kind of daring. I was the bridesmaid at an extreme wedding.\" She emerged from the closet with her hair disheveled, her eyes lit with triumph. She rotated the hanger so I could get the full effect. She\u0027d had to pin the dress to the hanger because there was so little to hang.\\n\\n \"Yikes,\" I said, uneasily. Made mostly of lime-green chiffon, it was cut in a deep V almost down to the waist. A single narrow strap ran around the neck.\\n\\n \"It was a movie star wedding,\" Amelia said, looking as if she had a lot of memories of the service. Since the dress was also backless, I was wondering how those Hollywood women kept their boobs covered. Double-sided tape? Some kind of glue? As I hadn\u0027t seen Claudine since she vanished from the courtyard before the ectoplasmic reconstruction, I had to assume she\u0027d gone back to her job and her life in Monroe. I could have used her special services just about now. There had to be a fairy spell that would make your dress stay still.\\n\\n \"At least you don\u0027t need a special bra to wear under it,\" Amelia said helpfully. That was true; it wasn\u0027t possible to wear a bra at all. \"And I\u0027ve got the shoes, if you can wear a seven.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a big help,\" I said, trying to sound pleased and grateful. \"I don\u0027t suppose you can do hair?\"\\n\\n \"Nah,\" Amelia said. She waved a hand at her own short \u0027do. \"I wash it, brush it, and that\u0027s that. But I can call Bob.\" Her eyes glowed happily. \"He\u0027s a hairdresser.\"\\n\\n I tried not to look too astonished. At a funeral home? I thought, but I was smart enough to keep that to myself. Bob just looked no way like any hairdresser I\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n After a couple of hours, I was more or less into the dress, and fully made up.\\n\\n Bob had done a good job with my hair, though he\u0027d reminded me several times to keep very still, in a way that had made me a little nervous.\\n\\n And Quinn had shown up on time in his car. When Eric and Rasul had dropped me off at about two in the morning, Quinn had just gotten in his car and driven away to wherever he was staying, though he\u0027d put a light kiss on my forehead before I started up the stairs. Amelia had come out of her apartment, all happy I was safely back, and I\u0027d had to return a call from Mr. Cataliades, who wondered if I was quite all right, and who wanted me to go to the bank with him to finalize Hadley\u0027s financial affairs. Since I\u0027d missed my chance to go with Everett, I\u0027d been grateful.\\n\\n But when I\u0027d returned to Hadley\u0027s apartment after the bank trip, I\u0027d found a message on Hadley\u0027s answering machine telling me that the queen expected to see me at the party at the old monastery tonight. \"I don\u0027t want you to leave the city without seeing me again,\" the queen\u0027s human secretary had quoted her as saying, before informing me that the dress code was formal. After my discovery, when I realized I\u0027d have to attend the party, I\u0027d gone down the stairs to Amelia\u0027s in a panic.\\n\\n The dress caused another kind of panic. I was better-endowed than Amelia, though a bit shorter, and I had to stand really straight.\\n\\n \"The suspense is killing me,\" said Quinn, eyeing my chest. He looked wonderful in a tux. My wrist bandages stuck out against my tan like strange bracelets; in fact, one of them was acutely uncomfortable, and I was anxious to take it off. But the wrist would have to stay covered a while, though the bite on my left arm could remain uncovered. Maybe the suspense about my boobs would distract party-goers from the fact that my face was swollen and discolored on one side.\\n\\n Quinn, of course, looked as though nothing had ever happened to him. Not only did he have the quick-healing flesh of most shape-shifters, but a man\u0027s tux covers up a lot of injuries.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you make me feel any more self-conscious than I already do,\" I said. \"For about a dime, I\u0027d go crawl back into bed and sleep for a week.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m up for that, though I\u0027d reduce the sleep time,\" Quinn said sincerely. \"But for our peace of mind, I think we better do this first. By the way, my suspense was about the trip to the bank, not your dress. I figure, with your dress, it\u0027s a win-win situation. If you stay in it, good. If you don\u0027t, even better.\"\\n\\n I looked away, trying to control an involuntary smile. \"The trip to the bank.\" That seemed like a safe topic. \"Well, her bank account didn\u0027t have a lot in it, which I figured would be the case. Hadley didn\u0027t have much sense about money. Hadley didn\u0027t have much sense, period. But the safe-deposit box...\"\\n\\n The safe-deposit box had held Hadley\u0027s birth certificate, a marriage license, and a divorce decree dated more than three years ago - both naming the same man, I was glad to see - and a laminated copy of my aunt\u0027s obituary. Hadley had known when her mother had died, and she\u0027d cared enough to keep the clipping. There were pictures from our shared childhood, too: my mother and her sister; my mother and Jason, me, and Hadley; my grandmother and her husband. There was a pretty necklace with sapphires and diamonds (which Mr. Cataliades had said the queen had given to Hadley), and a pair of matching earrings. There were a couple more things that I wanted to think about.\\n\\n But the queen\u0027s bracelet was not there. That was why Mr. Cataliades had wanted to accompany me, I think; he half expected the bracelet would be there, and he seemed quite anxious when I held the lockbox out to him so he could see its contents for himself.\\n\\n \"I finished packing the kitchen stuff this afternoon after Cataliades took me back to Hadley\u0027s apartment,\" I said to Quinn, and watched his reaction. I would never again take the disinterestedness of my companions for granted. I found myself fairly convinced Quinn had not been helping me pack the day before in order to search for something, after I saw that his reaction was perfectly calm.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" he said. \"Sorry I didn\u0027t make it over to help you today. I was closing out Jake\u0027s dealings with Special Events. I had to call my partners, let them know. I had to call Jake\u0027s girlfriend. He wasn\u0027t steady enough to be around her, if she even wants to see him again. She\u0027s not a vamp lover, to put it mildly.\"\\n\\n At the moment, I wasn\u0027t either. I couldn\u0027t fathom the true reason the queen wanted me at the party, but I had found another reason to see her. Quinn smiled at me, and I smiled back at him, hoping that some good would come out of this evening. I had to admit to myself that I was a bit curious about seeing the queen\u0027s party barn, so to speak - and I was also kind of glad to dress up and be pretty after all the swamp slogging.\\n\\n As we drove, I almost opened a conversation with Quinn at least three times - but on every occasion, when it got to the point, I kept my mouth shut.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re getting close,\" he told me when we\u0027d reached one of the oldest neighborhoods in New Orleans, the Garden District. The houses, set in beautiful grounds, would cost many times what even the Bellefleur mansion would fetch. In the middle of these marvelous homes, we came to a high wall that extended for a whole block. This was the renovated monastery that the queen used for entertaining.\\n\\n There might be other gates at the back of the property, but tonight all the traffic was moving through the main front entrance. It was heavily protected with the most efficient guards of all: vampires. I wondered if Sophie-Anne Leclerq was paranoid, or wise, or simply did not feel loved (or safe) in her adopted city. I was sure the queen also had the regular security provisions - cameras, infrared motion detectors, razor wire, maybe even guard dogs. There was security out the ying-yang here, where the elite vampires occasionally partied with the elite humans. Tonight the party was supes only, the first large party the newlyweds had given since they\u0027d become a couple.\\n\\n Three of the queen\u0027s vampires were at the gate, along with three of the Arkansas vampires. Peter Threadgill\u0027s vampires all wore a uniform, though I suspected the king called it livery. The Arkansas bloodsuckers, male and female, were wearing white suits with blue shirts and red vests. I didn\u0027t know if the king was ultrapatriotic or if the colors had been chosen because they were in the Arkansas state flag as well as the U.S. flag. Whichever, the suits were beyond tacky and into some fashion hall of shame, all on their own. And Threadgill had been dressed so conservatively! Was this some tradition I\u0027d never heard of? Gosh, even I knew better than that, tastewise, and I bought most of my clothes at Wal-Mart.\\n\\n Quinn had the queen\u0027s card to show to the guards at the gate, but still they called up to the main house. Quinn looked uneasy, and I hoped he was as concerned as I was about the extreme security and the fact that Threadgills vampires had worked so hard to distinguish themselves from the queen\u0027s adherents. I was thinking hard about the queen\u0027s need to offer the king\u0027s vamps a reason she would go upstairs with me at Hadley\u0027s. I thought of the anxiety she displayed when she asked about the bracelet. I thought of the presence of both camps of vampires at the main gate. Neither monarch trusted the spouse to provide protection.\\n\\n It seemed like a long time before we were given leave to pass through. Quinn was as quiet as I while we waited.\\n\\n The grounds seemed to be beautifully landscaped and kept, and they were certainly well lit.\\n\\n \"Quinn, this is just wrong,\" I said. \"What\u0027s going on here? Do you think they\u0027d let us leave?\" Unfortunately, it seemed as though all my suspicions were true.\\n\\n Quinn didn\u0027t look any happier than I was. \"They won\u0027t let us out,\" he said. \"We have to go on now.\" I clutched my little evening bag closer to me, wishing there was something more lethal in it than a few small items like a compact and a lipstick, and a tampon. Quinn drove us carefully up the winding drive to the front of the monastery.\\n\\n \"What did you do today, besides work on your outfit?\" Quinn asked.\\n\\n \"I made a lot of phone calls,\" I said. \"And one of them paid off.\"\\n\\n \"Calls? Where to?\"\\n\\n \"Gas stations, all along the route from New Orleans to Bon Temps.\"\\n\\n He turned to stare at me, but I pointed just in time for Quinn to apply the brakes.\\n\\n A lion strolled across the drive.\\n\\n \"Okay, what\u0027s that? Animal? Or shifter?\" I was edgier by the minute.\\n\\n \"Animal,\" Quinn said.\\n\\n Scratch the idea of dogs roaming the enclosure. I hoped the wall was high enough to keep the lion in.\\n\\n We parked in front of the former monastery, which was a very large two-story building. It hadn\u0027t been built for beauty, but for utility, so it was a largely featureless structure. There was one small door in the middle of the fa?ade, and small windows placed regularly. Again, fairly easy to defend.\\n\\n Outside the small door stood six more vampires, three in fancy but unmatching clothes - surely Louisiana bloodsuckers - and three more from Arkansas, in their glaringly garish outfits.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just butt-ugly,\" I said.\\n\\n \"But easy to see, even in the dark,\" Quinn said, looking as if he were thinking deep, significant thoughts.\\n\\n \"Duh,\" I said. \"Isn\u0027t that the point? So they\u0027ll instantly... oh.\" I mulled it over. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"No one would wear anything close to that, on purpose or by accident. Under any circumstances. Unless it was really important to be instantly identifiable.\"\\n\\n Quinn said, \"It\u0027s possible that Peter Threadgill is not devoted to Sophie-Anne.\"\\n\\n I gave a squawk of laughter just as two Louisiana vampires opened our car doors in a move so coordinated it must have been rehearsed. Melanie, the guard vampire I\u0027d met at the queen\u0027s downtown headquarters, took my hand to help me from the car, and she smiled at me. She looked a lot better out of the overwhelming SWAT gear. She was wearing a pretty yellow dress with low heels. Now that she wasn\u0027t wearing a helmet, I could see her hair was short, intensely curly, and light brown.\\n\\n She took a deep, dramatic breath as I passed, and then made an ecstatic face. \"Oh, the odor of the fairy!\" she exclaimed. \"It makes my heart sing!\"\\n\\n I swatted at her playfully. To say I was surprised would be an understatement. Vampires, as a whole, are not noted for their sense of humor.\\n\\n \"Cute dress,\" Rasul said. \"Kind of on the daring side, huh?\"\\n\\n Chester said, \"Can\u0027t be too daring for me. You look really tasty.\"\\n\\n I thought it couldn\u0027t be a coincidence that the three vampires I\u0027d met at the queen\u0027s headquarters were the three vampires on door duty tonight. I couldn\u0027t figure out what that could mean, though. The three Arkansas vampires were silent, regarding the to-and-fro between us with cold eyes. They were not in the same relaxed and smiling mood as their fellows.\\n\\n Something definitely off-kilter here. But with the acute vampire hearing all around, there wasn\u0027t anything to say about it.\\n\\n Quinn took my arm. We walked into a long hall that seemed to run nearly the length of the building. A Thread-gill vampire was standing at the door of a room that seemed to serve as a reception area.\\n\\n \"Would you like to check your bag?\" she asked, obviously put out at being relegated to a hat-check girl.\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" I said, and thought she was going to pull it out from under my arm.\\n\\n \"May I search it?\" she asked. \"We screen for weapons.\"\\n\\n I stared at her, always a risky thing to do to a vampire. \"Of course not. I have no weapons.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie,\" Quinn said, trying not to sound alarmed. \"You have to let her look in your purse. It\u0027s procedure.\"\\n\\n I glared at him. \"You could have told me,\" I said sharply.\\n\\n The door guard, who was a svelte young vamp with a figure that challenged the cut of the white pants, seized my purse with an air of triumph. She turned it out over a tray, and its few contents clattered to the metal surface: a compact, a lipstick, a tiny tube of glue, a handkerchief, a ten-dollar bill, and a tampon in a rigid plastic applicator, completely covered in plastic wrap.\\n\\n Quinn was not unsophisticated enough to turn red, but he did glance discreetly away. The vampire, who had died long before women carried such items in their purses, asked me its purpose and nodded when I explained. She repacked my little evening bag and handed it to me, indicating with a hand gesture that we should proceed down the hall. She\u0027d turned to the people who\u0027d come in behind us, a Were couple in their sixties, before we\u0027d even exited the room.\\n\\n \"What are you up to?\" Quinn asked, in the quietest possible voice, as we moved along the corridor.\\n\\n \"Do we have to pass through any more security?\" I asked, in a voice just as hushed.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t see any up ahead.\"\\n\\n \"I have to do something,\" I said. \"Excuse me, while I find the nearest ladies\u0027 room.\" I tried to tell him, with my eyes, and with the pressure of my hand on his arm, that in a few minutes everything would be all right, and I sincerely hoped that was the truth. Quinn was clearly not happy with me, but he waited outside the ladies\u0027 room (God knows what that had been when the building was a monastery) while I ducked into one of the stalls and made a few adjustments. When I came out, I\u0027d tossed the tampon container into the little bin in the stall, and one of my wrists had been rebandaged. My purse was a little heavier.\\n\\n The door at the end of the corridor led into the very large room that had been the monks\u0027 refectory. Though the room was still walled with stone and large pillars supported the roof, three on the left and three on the right, the rest of the decor was considerably different now. The middle of the room was cleared for dancing, and the floor was wooden. There was a dais for musicians close to the refreshments table, and another dais at the opposite end of the room for the royalty.\\n\\n Around the sides of the room were chairs in conversational groupings. The whole room was decorated in white and blue, the colors of Louisiana. One of the walls had murals depicting scenes from around the state: a swamp scene, which made me shudder; a Bourbon Street montage; a field being plowed and lumber being cut; and a fisherman hoisting up a net in the Gulf Coast. These were all scenes featuring humans, I thought, and wondered what the thinking was behind that. Then I turned to look at the wall surrounding the doorway I\u0027d just entered, and I saw the vampire side of Louisiana life: a group of happy vampires with fiddles under their chins, playing away; a vampire police officer patrolling the French Quarter; a vampire guide leading tourists through one of the Cities of the Dead. No vamps snacking on humans, no vamps drinking anything, I noticed. This was a statement in public relations. I wondered if it really fooled anyone. All you had to do was sit down at a supper table with vampires, and you\u0027d be reminded how different they were, all right.\\n\\n Well, this wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d come to do. I looked around for the queen, and I finally saw her standing by her husband. She was wearing a long-sleeved orange silk dress, and she looked fabulous. Long sleeves maybe seemed a little strange in the warm evening, but vampires didn\u0027t notice such things. Peter Threadgill was wearing a tux, and he looked equally impressive. Jade Flower was standing behind him, sword strapped to her back even though she was wearing a red sequined dress (in which, by the way, she looked awful). Andre, also fully armed, was at his station behind the queen. Sigebert and Wybert couldn\u0027t be far off. I spotted them on either side of a door that I assumed led to the queen\u0027s private apartments. The two vampires looked acutely uncomfortable in their tuxes; it was like watching bears who\u0027d been made to wear shoes.\\n\\n Bill was in the room. I caught a glimpse of him in the far corner, in the opposite direction from the queen, and I shivered with loathing.\\n\\n \"You have too many secrets,\" Quinn complained, following the direction of my gaze.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be glad to tell you a few of \u0027em, real soon,\" I promised, and we joined the tail end of the reception line. \"When we reach the royals, you go ahead of me. While I\u0027m talking to the queen, you distract the king, okay? Then I will tell you everything.\"\\n\\n We reached to Mr. Cataliades first. I guess he was sort of the queen\u0027s secretary of state. Or maybe attorney general would be more appropriate?\\n\\n \"Good to see you again, Mr. Cataliades,\" I said, in my most correct social tone. \"I\u0027ve got a surprise for you,\" I added.\\n\\n \"You may have to save it,\" he said with a kind of stiff cordiality. \"The queen is about to have the first dance with her new king. And we\u0027re all so looking forward to seeing the present the king gave her.\"\\n\\n I glanced around but I didn\u0027t see Diantha. \"How\u0027s your niece?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"My surviving niece,\" he said grimly, \"is at home with her mother.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s too bad,\" I said. \"She should be here this evening.\"\\n\\n He stared at me. Then he looked interested.\\n\\n \"Indeed,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I heard that someone from here stopped to get gas a week ago Wednesday, on her way to Bon Temps,\" I said. \"Someone with a long sword. Here, let me tuck this in your pocket. I don\u0027t need it any more.\" When I stepped away from him and faced the queen, I had one hand over my injured wrist. The bandage had vanished.\\n\\n I held out my right hand, and the queen was forced to take it in her own. I had counted on obliging the queen to follow the human custom of shaking hands, and I was mighty relieved when she did. Quinn had passed from the queen to the king, and he said, \"Your Majesty, I\u0027m sure you remember me. I was the event coordinator at your wedding. Did the flowers turn out like you wanted?\"\\n\\n Somewhat startled, Peter Threadgill turned his large eyes on Quinn, and Jade Flower kept her eyes on what her king did.\\n\\n Trying very hard to keep my movements swift but not jerky, I pressed my left hand and what was in it onto the queen\u0027s wrist. She didn\u0027t flinch, but I think she thought about it. She glanced down at her wrist to see what I\u0027d put on it, and her eyes closed in relief.\\n\\n \"Yes, my dear, our visit was lovely,\" she said, at random. \"Andre enjoyed it very much, as did I.\" She glanced back over her shoulder, and Andre picked up his cue, and inclined his head to me, in tribute to my supposed talents in the sack. I was so glad to get the ordeal over with that I smiled at him radiantly, and he looked a shade amused. The queen raised her arm slightly to beckon him closer, and her sleeve rode up. Suddenly Andre was smiling as broadly as I was.\\n\\n Jade Flower was distracted by Andre\u0027s movement forward, and her eyes followed his. They widened, and she was very much not smiling. In fact, she was enraged. Mr. Cataliades was looking at the sword on Jade Flower\u0027s back with a completely blank face.\\n\\n Then Quinn was dismissed by the king and it was my turn to pay homage to Peter Threadgill, King of Arkansas.\\n\\n \"I hear that you had an adventure in the swamps yesterday,\" he said, his voice cool and indifferent.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. But it all worked out okay, I think,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Good of you to come,\" he said. \"Now that you have wrapped up your cousin\u0027s estate, I am sure you will be returning to your home?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, quick as can be,\" I said. It was the absolute truth. I would go home providing I could just survive this evening, though at the moment the chances weren\u0027t looking too good. I had counted, as well as I was able in a throng like this. There were at least twenty vampires in the room wearing the bright Arkansas outfit, and perhaps the same number of the queen\u0027s homies.\\n\\n I moved away, and the Were couple that had entered after Quinn and me took my place. I thought he was the lieutenant governor of Louisiana, and I hoped he had good life insurance.\\n\\n \"What?\" Quinn demanded.\\n\\n I led him over to a place against the wall, and gently maneuvered him until his back was against it. I had to face away from any lip-readers in the room.\\n\\n \"Did you know the queen\u0027s bracelet was missing?\" I asked.\\n\\n He shook his head. \"One of the diamond bracelets the king gave her as a wedding present?\" he asked, his head ducked to baffle any watchers.\\n\\n \"Yes, missing,\" I said. \"Since Hadley died.\"\\n\\n \"If the king knew the bracelet was missing, and if he could force the queen to acknowledge that she\u0027d given it to a lover, then he would have grounds for divorce.\"\\n\\n \"What would he get then?\"\\n\\n \"What wouldn\u0027t he get! It was a vampire hierarchal marriage, and you don\u0027t get any more binding than that. I think the wedding contract was thirty pages.\"\\n\\n I understood much better now.\\n\\n A beautifully dressed vampire woman wearing a gray-green gown strewn with gleaming silver flowers raised her arm to get the attention of the crowd. Gradually the assembled people fell silent.\\n\\n \"Sophie-Anne and Peter welcome you to their first joint entertainment,\" the vamp said, and her voice was so musical and mellow that you wanted to listen to her for hours. They should get her to do the Oscars. Or the Miss America pageant. \"Sophie-Anne and Peter invite all of you to have a wonderful evening of dancing, eating, and drinking. To open the dancing, our host and hostess will waltz.\"\\n\\n Despite his glitzy surface, I thought Peter might be more comfortable doing a square dance, but with a wife like Sophie-Anne, it was waltz or nothing. He advanced on his wife, his arms at the ready to receive her, and in his carrying vampire voice he said, \"Darling, show them the bracelets.\"\\n\\n Sophie-Anne swept the crowd with a smile and raised her own arms to make the sleeves slide back, and a matching bracelet on each wrist shone at the guests, the two huge diamonds winking and blinking in the chandelier lights.\\n\\n For a moment Peter Threadgill was absolutely still, as if someone had zapped him with a freeze gun. He altered his stance as he moved forward, after that, and took one of her hands in both of his. He stared down at one bracelet, then released her hand to take the other. That bracelet, too, passed his silent test.\\n\\n \"Wonderful,\" he said, and if it was through his fangs you\u0027d only think they\u0027d extended because he was horny for his beautiful wife. \"You\u0027re wearing both of them.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Sophie-Anne said. \"My darling.\" Her smile was just as sincere as his.\\n\\n And away they danced, though something about the way he swung her let me know the king was letting his temper get the better of him. He\u0027d had a big plan, and now I\u0027d spoiled it... but thankfully, he didn\u0027t know my part. He just knew that somehow Sophie-Anne had managed to retrieve her bracelet and save her face, and he had nothing to justify whatever he\u0027d plotted to do. He would have to back down. After this, he\u0027d probably think of another way to subvert his queen, but at least I\u0027d be out of the fray.\\n\\n Quinn and I retreated to the refreshments table, located to the south side of the large room, beside one of the thick pillars. Servers were there with carving knives to shave off ham or roast beef. There were yeasty rolls to pile the meat on. It smelled wonderful, but I was too nervous to think of eating. Quinn got me a cup of ginger ale from the bar.\\n\\n I stared at the dancing couple and waited for the ceiling to fall in.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t they look lovely together?\" a well-dressed gray-haired woman said. I realized she was the one who\u0027d come in after me.\\n\\n \"Yes, they do,\" I agreed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Genevieve Thrash,\" she said. \"This is my husband, David.\"\\n\\n \"Pleased to meet you,\" I said. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse, and this is my friend, John Quinn.\" Quinn looked surprised. I wondered if that was actually his first name.\\n\\n The two men, tiger and Were, shook hands while Genevieve and I watched the couple dance a bit longer.\\n\\n \"Your dress is so pretty,\" Genevieve said, giving every indication she was speaking sincerely. \"It takes a young body to show off a gown like that.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate your saying so,\" I said. \"I\u0027m showing a bit more of that body than I\u0027m comfortable with, so you\u0027ve made me feel better.\"\\n\\n \"I know your date appreciates it,\" she said. \"And so does that young man over there.\" She nodded her head subtly, and I glanced in the direction she was indicating. Bill. He looked very good in his tuxedo, but even being in the same room made something within me twist with pain.\\n\\n \"I believe your husband is the lieutenant governor?\" I said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re absolutely correct.\"\\n\\n \"And how do you like being Mrs. Lieutenant?\" I asked.\\n\\n She told some amusing stories about people she\u0027d met while she followed David\u0027s political career. \"And what does your young man do?\" she asked, with that eager interest that must have helped her husband up that ladder.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s an events coordinator,\" I said, after a moment\u0027s hesitation.\\n\\n \"How interesting,\" Genevieve said. \"And yourself, you have a job?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes ma\u0027am,\" I said. \"I\u0027m a barmaid.\"\\n\\n That was a bit startling to the politician\u0027s wife, but she grinned at me. \"You\u0027re the first I\u0027ve ever met,\" she said cheerfully.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the first Mrs. Lieutenant Governor I\u0027ve ever met,\" I said. Damn, now that I\u0027d met her and liked her, I felt responsible for her. Quinn and David were just chatting away, and I think fishing was their topic.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Thrash,\" I said, \"I know you\u0027re a Were and that means you\u0027re tough as tough can be, but I\u0027m going to give you a piece of advice.\"\\n\\n She looked at me quizzically.\\n\\n \"This advice is pure gold,\" I said.\\n\\n Her eyebrows flew up. \"Okay,\" she said, slowly. \"I\u0027m listening.\"\\n\\n \"Something very bad is going to happen here in the next hour or so. It\u0027s going to be so bad that it might get a lot of people killed. Now you can stay and have a good time until it happens, and then you\u0027ll wonder why you didn\u0027t listen to me, or you can leave now after acting like you\u0027ve been taken ill, and you can save yourself a lot of unhappiness.\"\\n\\n Her gaze was intent. I could hear her wondering whether to take me seriously. I didn\u0027t seem like a weirdo or a crazy person. I seemed like a normal, attractive, young woman with a heck of a handsome date.\\n\\n \"Are you threatening me?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m trying to save your ass.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get one dance in first,\" Genevieve Thrash said, making up her mind. \"David, honey, let\u0027s take a spin around the dance floor and then make our excuses. I\u0027ve got the worst headache you ever felt.\" David obligingly broke off his conversation with Quinn to take his wife to the clear space and begin waltzing along with the royal vampire couple, who looked relieved to have company.\\n\\n I was beginning to relax my posture again, but a glance from Quinn reminded me to stand very straight. \"I love the dress,\" he said. \"Shall we dance?\"\\n\\n \"You can waltz?\" I hoped my jaw hadn\u0027t dropped too far.\\n\\n \"Yep,\" he said. He didn\u0027t ask if I could, though as a matter of fact I\u0027d been watching the queen\u0027s steps intently. I can dance - can\u0027t sing, but I love a dance floor. I\u0027d never waltzed, but I figured I could do it.\\n\\n It was wonderful to have Quinn\u0027s arm around me, to be moving so gracefully around the floor. For a moment, I just forgot everything and enjoyed looking up at him, feeling the way a girl feels when she\u0027s dancing with a guy she expects she\u0027ll make love with, sooner or later. Quinn\u0027s fingers touching my bare back just made me tingle.\\n\\n \"Sooner or later,\" he said, \"we\u0027re gonna be in a room with a bed, no phones, and a door that will lock.\"\\n\\n I smiled up at him and spied the Thrashes easing out of the door. I hoped their car had been brought around. And that was the last normal thought I had for some time.\\n\\n A head flew past Quinn\u0027s shoulder. It was moving too fast for me to pin down whose head it was, but it looked familiar. A spray of blood created a ruddy cloud in the head\u0027s wake.\\n\\n I made a sound. It wasn\u0027t a scream or a gasp; more like \"Eeeeep.\"\\n\\n Quinn stopped dead, though the music didn\u0027t for a long moment. He looked in all directions, trying to analyze what was happening and how we could survive it. I\u0027d thought one dance would be okay, but we should have gone with the Were couple. Quinn began pulling me over to the side of the ballroom, and he said, \"Backs against the wall.\" We\u0027d know from which direction the danger was coming: good thinking. But someone cannoned into us and Quinn\u0027s hold on my hand was broken.\\n\\n There was a lot of screaming and a lot of movement. The screaming was all from the Weres and other supes who\u0027d been invited to the party, and the movement was mostly from the vampires, who were looking for their allies amid the chaos. This was where the horrible outfits worn by the king\u0027s followers came into their own. It was instantly easy to see who belonged to the king. Of course, that made them an easy target, too, if you didn\u0027t happen to like the king and his minions.\\n\\n A thin black vampire with dreadlocks had whipped a sword with a curved blade out of nowhere, apparently. The blade was bloody, and I thought Dreadlocks was the head-lopper. He was wearing the awful suit, so he was someone I wanted to dodge. If I had any allies here, it wasn\u0027t anyone working for Peter Threadgill. I\u0027d gotten behind one of the pillars holding up the ceiling of the west end of the refectory, and I was trying to figure out the safest way from the room when my foot bumped something that shifted. I looked down to see the head. It belonged to Wybert. I wondered for a fraction of a second if it would move or speak, but decapitation is pretty final, no matter what species you are.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I moaned, and decided I\u0027d better get a good hold on myself, or I was gonna look just like Wybert, at least in one important respect.\\n\\n Fighting had broken out throughout the room. I hadn\u0027t seen the precipitating incident, but on some pretext the black vampire had attacked Wybert and cut off his head. Since Wybert was one of the queen\u0027s bodyguards and Dreadlocks was one of Peter\u0027s attendants, the beheading was a pretty decisive act.\\n\\n The queen and Andre were standing back to back in the middle of the floor. Andre was holding a gun in one hand and a long knife in the other, and the queen had acquired a carving knife from the buffet. There was a circle of white coats surrounding them, and when one fell, another would take its place. This was like Custer\u0027s last stand, with the queen standing in for Custer. Sigebert was equally besieged on the bandstand, and the orchestra, part Were or shifter and part vampire, had separated into its various components. Some were joining in the combat, while others were trying to flee. Those who were doing their best to get the hell out of there were clogging the door leading to the long corridor. The effect was a logjam.\\n\\n The king was under attack from my three friends Rasul, Chester, and Melanie. I was sure I\u0027d find Jade Flower at his back, but she was having her own problems, I was glad to see. Mr. Cataliades was doing his best to - well, it looked like he was just trying to touch her. She was parrying his attempts with her whacking big sword, the sword that had sliced Gladiola in two, but neither of them looked like they were giving up any time soon.\\n\\n Just then I was knocked flat to the floor, losing my breath for a minute. I struck out, only to have my hand trapped. I was smushed under a big body. \"I\u0027ve got you,\" Eric said.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"Protecting you,\" he said. He was smiling with the joy of battle, and his blue eyes were glittering like sapphires. Eric loved a brawl.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see anybody coming after me,\" I said. \"It seems to me like the queen needs you more than I do. But I appreciate it.\"\\n\\n Carried away on a wave of excitement, Eric kissed me long and hard and then scooped up Wybert\u0027s head. \"Bowling for vampires,\" he said happily, and flung the disgusting object at the black vampire with an accuracy and force that knocked the sword out of the vampire\u0027s hand. Eric was on it with a great leap, and the sword swung on its owner with deadly force. With a war cry that had not been heard in a thousand years, Eric attacked the circle around the queen and Andre with a savagery and abandon that was almost beautiful in its way.\\n\\n A shifter trying to find another way out of the room knocked against me with enough force to dislodge me from behind my comparatively secure position. Suddenly, there were too many people between me and the pillar, and the way back was blocked. Damn! I could see the door Wybert and his brother had been guarding. The door was across the room, but it was the only empty passage. Any way out of this room was a good way. I began sidling around the walls to reach it, so I wouldn\u0027t have to cross the dangerous open spaces.\\n\\n One of the whitecoats leaped in front of me.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re supposed to find you!\" he bellowed. He was a young vampire; there were clues, even at such a moment. This vamp had known the amenities of modern life. He had all the signs - superstraight teeth that had known braces, a husky build from modern nutrition, and he was big-boned and tall.\\n\\n \"Look!\" I said, and pulled one side of my bodice away. He did, God bless him, and I kicked him in the balls so hard I thought they\u0027d come out through his mouth. That\u0027s gonna get a man on the floor, no matter what their nature is. This vampire was no exception. I hurried around him and reached the east wall, the one with the door.\\n\\n I had maybe a yard to go when someone grabbed my foot, and down I went. I slipped in a pool of blood and landed on my knees in it. It was vamp blood, I could tell by the color.\\n\\n \"Bitch,\" said Jade Flower. \"Whore.\" I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever heard her talk before. I could have done without it now. She began dragging me, hand over hand, toward her extended fangs. She wasn\u0027t getting up to kill me, because one of her legs was missing. I almost threw up but became more concerned with getting away than with ralphing. My hands scrabbled at the smooth wood floor, and my knees tried to get purchase so I could pull away from the vampire. I didn\u0027t know if Jade Flower would die of this terrible wound or not. Vampires could survive so many things that would kill a human, which of course was a big part of the attraction... Snap to, Sookie! I told myself fiercely.\\n\\n The shock must be getting to me.\\n\\n I threw out my hand and managed to get a grip on the door frame. I pulled and pulled, but I couldn\u0027t break free from Jade Flower\u0027s hold, and her fingers were digging into the flesh of my ankle. Soon she would snap the bones, and then I wouldn\u0027t be able to walk.\\n\\n With my free foot I kicked the little Asian woman in the face. I did it again and again. Her nose was bleeding, and her lips were, too, but she would not let go. I don\u0027t think she even felt it.\\n\\n Then Bill jumped on her back, landing with enough force to break her spine, and her hold on my ankle relaxed. I scrambled away while he raised a carving knife very like the one the queen had had. He sank it into Jade Flower\u0027s neck, over and over, and then her head was off and he was looking at me.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t speak, just gave me that long, dark look. Then he was up and gone, and I had to get the hell out of there.\\n\\n The queen\u0027s apartments were dark. That wasn\u0027t good. Beyond where the light penetrated from the ballroom, who knew what could be lurking?\\n\\n There just had to be an outside door through here. The queen wouldn\u0027t leave herself bottled up. She\u0027d have a way to get outside. And if I was remembering the orientation of the building, I needed to walk straight ahead to reach the correct wall.\\n\\n I gathered myself and decided I\u0027d just stride right on through. No more of this skulking around the wall. The hell with it.\\n\\n And to my surprise, it worked, up to a point. I went through one room - a sitting room, I figured - before I ended up in what must have been the queen\u0027s bedroom. A whisper of movement in the room retriggered my fear switch, and I fumbled along the wall for the light. When I flipped it, I found I was in the room with Peter Threadgill. He was facing Andre. A bed was between them, and on the bed was the queen, who had been badly wounded. Andre didn\u0027t have his sword, but then neither did Peter Threadgill. Andre did have a gun, and when I turned on the light, he shot the king right in the face. Twice.\\n\\n There was a door beyond the body of Peter Threadgill. It had to lead to the grounds. I began to sidle around the room, my back pressed against the wall. No one paid a bit of attention to me.\\n\\n \"Andre, if you kill him,\" the queen said quite calmly, \"I\u0027ll have to pay a huge fine.\" She had a hand pressed to her side, and her beautiful orange dress was dark and wet with her blood.\\n\\n \"But wouldn\u0027t it be worth it, lady?\"\\n\\n There was a thoughtful silence on the queen\u0027s part, while I unlocked about six locks.\\n\\n \"On the whole, yes,\" Sophie-Anne said. \"After all, money isn\u0027t everything.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, good\" Andre said happily, and raised the gun. He had a stake in the other hand, I saw. I didn\u0027t stick around to see how Andre did the deed.\\n\\n I set off across the lawn in my green evening shoes. Amazingly, the evening shoes were still intact. In fact, they were in better shape than my ankle, which Jade Flower had hurt pretty badly. I was limping by the time I\u0027d taken ten steps. \"Watch out for the lion,\" called the queen, and I looked behind me to see that Andre was carrying her out of the building. I wondered whose side the lion was on.\\n\\n Then the big cat appeared right in front of me. One minute my escape route was clear, and the next it was filled by a lion. The outside security lights were off, and in the moonlight the beast looked so beautiful and so deadly that fear pulled the air right out of my lungs.\\n\\n The lion made a low, guttural sound.\\n\\n \"Go away,\" I said. I had absolutely nothing to fight a lion with, and I was at the end of my rope. \"Go away!\" I yelled. \"Get out of here!\"\\n\\n And it slunk into the bushes.\\n\\n I don\u0027t think that is typical lion behavior. Maybe it smelled the tiger coming, because a second or two later, Quinn appeared, moving like a huge silent dream across the grass. Quinn rubbed his big head against me, and we went over to the wall together. Andre laid down his queen and leaped up on top with grace and ease. For his queen, he pulled apart the razor wire with hands just barely cushioned with his torn coat. Then down he came and carefully lifted Sophie-Anne. He gathered himself and cleared the wall in a bound.\\n\\n \"Well, I can\u0027t do that,\" I said, and even to my own ears, I sounded grumpy. \"Can I stand on your back? I\u0027ll take my heels off.\" Quinn snugged up to the wall, and I ran my arm through the sandal straps. I didn\u0027t want to hurt the tiger by putting a lot of weight on his back, but I also wanted to get out of there more than I\u0027ve wanted anything, just about. So, trying to think light thoughts, I balanced on the tiger\u0027s back and managed to pull myself, finally, to the top of the wall. I looked down, and it seemed like a very long way to the sidewalk.\\n\\n After all I\u0027d faced this evening, it seemed stupid to balk at falling a few feet. But I sat on the wall, telling myself I was an idiot, for several long moments. Then I managed to flip over onto my stomach, let myself down as far as I could reach, and said out loud, \"One, two, three!\" Then I fell.\\n\\n For a couple of minutes I just lay there, stunned at how the evening had turned out.\\n\\n Here I was, lying on a sidewalk in historical New Orleans, with my boobs hanging out of my dress, my hair coming down, my sandals on my arm, and a large tiger licking my face. Quinn had bounded over with relative ease.\\n\\n \"Do you think it would be better to walk back as a tiger, or as a large naked man?\" I asked the tiger. \"Because either way, you might attract some attention. I think you stand a better chance of getting shot if you\u0027re a tiger, myself.\"\\n\\n \"That will not be necessary,\" said a voice, and Andre loomed above me. \"I am here with the queen in her car, and we will take you where you need to go.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s mighty nice of you,\" I said, as Quinn began to change back.\\n\\n \"Her Majesty feels that she owes you,\" Andre said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see it that way,\" I said. Why was I being so frank, now? Couldn\u0027t I just keep my mouth shut? \"After all, if I hadn\u0027t found the bracelet and given it back, the king would have...\"\\n\\n \"Started the war tonight anyway,\" Andre said, helping me to my feet. He reached out and quite impersonally pushed my right breast under the scanty lime-green fabric. \"He would have accused the queen of breaking her side of the contract, which held that all gifts must be held in honor as tokens of the marriage. He would have brought suit against the queen, and she would have lost almost everything and been dishonored. He was ready to go either way, but when the queen was wearing the second bracelet, he had to go with violence. Ra Shawn set it off by beheading Wybert for bumping against him.\" Ra Shawn had been Dreadlock\u0027s name, I assumed.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure I got all that, but I was equally sure Quinn could explain it to me at a time when I had more brain cells to spare for the information.\\n\\n \"He was so disappointed when he saw she had the bracelet! And it was the right one!\" Andre said merrily. He was turning into a babbling brook, that Andre. He helped me into the car. \"Where was it?\" asked the queen, who was stretched across one of the seats. Her bleeding had stopped, and only the way she was holding her lips indicated what pain she was in.\\n\\n \"It was in the can of coffee that looked sealed,\" I said. \"Hadley was real good with arts and crafts, and she\u0027d opened the can real carefully, popped the bracelet inside, and resealed it with a glue gun.\" There was a lot more to explain, about Mr. Cataliades and Gladiola and Jade Flower, but I was too tired to volunteer information.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you get it past the search?\" the queen asked. \"I\u0027m sure the searchers were checking for it.\"\\n\\n \"I had the bracelet part on under my bandage,\" I said. \"The diamond stood out too far, though, so I had to prize it out. I put it in a tampon holder. The vampire who did the searching didn\u0027t think of pulling out the tampon, and she didn\u0027t really know how it was supposed to look, since she hadn\u0027t had a period in centuries.\"\\n\\n \"But it was put together,\" the queen said.\\n\\n \"Oh, I went into the ladies room after I\u0027d had my purse searched. I had a little tube of superglue in my purse, too.\"\\n\\n The queen didn\u0027t seem to know what to say. \"Thank you,\" she told me, after a long pause. Quinn had climbed into the back with us, quite bare, and I leaned against him. Andre got into the driver\u0027s seat, and we glided off.\\n\\n He dropped us off in the courtyard. Amelia was sitting on the pavement in her lawn chair, a glass of wine in her hand.\\n\\n When we emerged, she set the glass down very carefully on the ground and then looked us over from head to toe.\\n\\n \"Okay, don\u0027t know how to react,\" she said, finally. The big car glided out of the courtyard as Andre took the queen to some safe hideaway. I didn\u0027t ask, because I didn\u0027t want to know.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you tomorrow,\" I said. \"The moving truck will be here tomorrow afternoon, and the queen promised me people to load it and drive it. I have to get back to Bon Temps.\"\\n\\n The prospect of going home seemed so sweet I could taste it on my tongue.\\n\\n \"So you got lots to do at home?\" Amelia asked, as Quinn and I began going up the stairs. I guessed Quinn could sleep in the same bed. We were both too tired to plunge into anything; tonight was not the night to begin a relationship, if I hadn\u0027t already begun one. Maybe I had.\\n\\n \"Well, I have a lot of weddings to go to,\" I said. \"I have to get back to work, too.\"\\n\\n \"Got an empty guest bedroom?\"\\n\\n I stopped about halfway up the stairs. \"I might. Would you be needing one?\"\\n\\n It was hard to tell in the poor light, but Amelia might be looking embarrassed. \"I tried something new with Bob,\" she said. \"And it didn\u0027t exactly work out right.\"\\n\\n \"Where is he?\" I asked. \"In the hospital?\"\\n\\n \"No, right there,\" she said. She was pointing at a garden gnome.\\n\\n \"Tell me you\u0027re joking,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m joking,\" she said. \"This is Bob.\" She picked up a big black cat with a white chest that had been curled up in an empty planter. I hadn\u0027t even noticed him. \"Isn\u0027t he cute?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, bring him along,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve always been fond of cats.\"\\n\\n \"Babe,\" said Quinn, \"I\u0027m glad to hear you say that. I was too tired to completely change.\"\\n\\n For the first time, I really looked at Quinn.\\n\\n Now he had a tail.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re definitely sleeping on the floor,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Ah, babe.\"\\n\\n \"I mean it. Tomorrow you\u0027ll be able to be all human, right?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I\u0027ve changed too many times lately. I just need some rest.\"\\n\\n Amelia was looking at the tail with wide eyes. \"See you tomorrow, Sookie,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll have us a little road trip. And then I\u0027ll get to stay with you for a while!\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have such fun,\" I said wearily, trudging up the rest of the stairs and feeling profoundly glad I\u0027d stuck my door key in my underwear. Quinn was too tired to watch me retrieve it. I let the remnants of the dress fall back into place while I unlocked the door. \"Such fun.\"\\n\\n Later, after I\u0027d showered and while Quinn was in the bathroom himself, I heard a tentative knock on the door. I was decent enough in my sleep pants and tank top. Though I wanted to ignore it more than anything, I opened the door.\\n\\n Bill was looking pretty good for someone who\u0027d fought in a war. The tuxedo would never be functional again, but he wasn\u0027t bleeding, and whatever cuts he might have sustained had already healed over.\\n\\n \"I have to talk to you,\" he said, and his voice was so quiet and limp that I took a step out of the apartment. I sat down on the gallery floor, and he sat with me.\\n\\n \"You have to let me say this, just once,\" he said. \"I loved you. I love you.\"\\n\\n I raised a hand to protest, and he said, \"No, let me finish. She sent me there, true. But when I met you - after I came to know you - I really... loved you.\"\\n\\n How long after he\u0027d taken me to bed had this supposed love come about? How could I possibly believe him, since he\u0027d lied so convincingly from the very moment I\u0027d met him - playing disinterested because he could read my fascination with the first vampire I\u0027d ever met?\\n\\n \"I risked my life for you,\" I said, the words coming out in a halting sequence. \"I gave Eric power over me forever, for your sake, when I took his blood. I killed someone for you. This is not something I take for granted, even if you do... even if that\u0027s everyday existence for you. It\u0027s not, for me. I don\u0027t know if I can ever not hate you.\"\\n\\n I got up, slowly and painfully, and to my relief he didn\u0027t make the mistake of trying to help me. \"You probably saved my life tonight,\" I said, looking down at him. \"And I thank you for that. But don\u0027t come into Merlotte\u0027s any more, don\u0027t hang around in my woods, and don\u0027t do anything else for me. I don\u0027t want to see you again.\"\\n\\n \"I love you,\" he said stubbornly, as if that fact were so amazing and such an undeniable truth that I should believe him. Well, I had, and look at where it had gotten me.\\n\\n \"Those words are not a magical formula,\" I said. \"They\u0027re not going to open my heart to you.\"\\n\\n Bill was over a hundred and thirty years old, but at that moment I felt I could match him. I dragged myself inside, shut the door behind me and locked it, and made myself go down the hall to the bedroom.\\n\\n Quinn was drying himself off, and he turned around to show me his muscular derriere. \"Fur-free,\" he said. \"Can I share the bed?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, and crawled in. He got in the other side, and he was asleep in thirty seconds. After a minute or two, I slid over in the bed and put my head on his chest.\\n\\n I listened to his heartbeat. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-22.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) \\n As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
