{"id":101264,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"Your Majesty, we have to stop,\" Amelia said, and the queen gave a flick of her hand that might have been agreement.\\n\\n Terry was so exhausted she was leaning heavily against the railing of the stairs, and Patsy was looking almost as haggard out on the gallery. The nerdy Bob seemed unchanged, but then he\u0027d wisely seated himself in a chair to start with. At Amelia\u0027s wordless signal, they began undoing the spell they\u0027d cast, and gradually the eerie atmosphere lessened. We became an ill-assorted bunch of weird people in a courtyard in New Orleans, rather than helpless witnesses to a magical reenactment.\\n\\n Amelia went to the corner storage shed and pulled out some folding chairs. Sigebert and Wybert did not understand the mechanism, so Amelia and Bob set the chairs out.\\n\\n After the queen and the witches sat, there was one remaining seat, and I took it after a silent to and fro between me and the four vampires.\\n\\n \"So we know what happened the next night,\" I said wearily. I was feeling a little silly in my fancy dress and high-heeled sandals. It would be nice to put on my regular clothes.\\n\\n \"Uh, \u0027scuse me, you might, but the rest of us don\u0027t, and we want to know,\" Bob said. He seemed oblivious to the fact that he ought to be shaking in his sandals in the queen\u0027s presence.\\n\\n There was something kind of likable about the geeky witch. And all four had worked so hard; if they wanted to know the rest of the story, there wasn\u0027t any reason they couldn\u0027t hear it. The queen raised no objection. Even Jade Flower, who had resheathed her sword, looked faintly interested.\\n\\n \"The next night, Waldo lured Hadley to the cemetery with the story of the Marie Laveau grave and the vampire tradition that the dead can raise the dead - in this case, the voodoo priestess Marie Laveau. Hadley wanted Marie Laveau to answer her questions, which Waldo had told Hadley the ghost could, if the correct ritual was followed. Though Waldo gave me a reason Hadley agreed to do this on the night I met him, now I know he was lying. But I can think of several other reasons she might have agreed to go with Waldo to St. Louis Cemetery,\" I said. The queen nodded silently. \"I think she wanted to find out what Jake would be like when he rose,\" I said. \"I think she wanted to find out what to do with him. She couldn\u0027t let him die, you saw that, but she didn\u0027t want to admit to anyone that she had created a vampire, especially one that had been a Were.\"\\n\\n I had quite an audience. Sigebert and Wybert were squatting on either side of the queen, and they were wrapped up in the story. This must be like going to the movies, for them.\\n\\n All the witches were interested in hearing the backstory on the events they\u0027d just witnessed. Jade Flower had her eyes fixed on me. Only Andre seemed immune, and he was busy doing his bodyguard job, constantly scanning the courtyard and the sky for attack.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible, too, that Hadley might have believed the ghost could give her advice on how to regain the queen\u0027s affections. No offense, ma\u0027am,\" I added, remembering too late that the queen was sitting three feet away from me in a folding lawn chair with the Wal-Mart price label still hanging on a plastic loop.\\n\\n The queen waved her hand in a negligent gesture. She was sunk in thought, so deeply that I wasn\u0027t even sure she heard me.\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t Waldo who drained Jake Purifoy,\" the queen said, to my amazement. \"Waldo could not have imagined that when he succeeded in killing Hadley and reported it to me, blaming it on the Fellowship of the Sun, this clever witch would obey the order to seal the apartment very literally, including a stasis spell. Waldo already had a plan. Whoever killed Jake had a separate plan - perhaps to blame Hadley for Jake\u0027s death and his rebirth... which would condemn her to jail in a vampire cell. Perhaps the killer thought that Jake would kill Hadley when he rose in three days... and possibly, he would have.\"\\n\\n Amelia tried to look modest, but it was an uphill battle. It should have been easy, since the only reason she\u0027d cast the spell was to prevent the apartment from smelling like garbage when it finally was reopened. She knew it, and I knew it. But it had been a pretty piece of witchcraft, and I wasn\u0027t about to burst her bubble.\\n\\n Amelia burst it all by herself.\\n\\n \"Or maybe,\" she said blithely, \"someone paid Waldo to get Hadley out of the picture, by one means or another.\"\\n\\n I had to shut down my shields immediately, because all the witches began broadcasting such strong panic signals that being around them was unbearable. They knew that what Amelia had said would upset the queen, and when the Queen of Louisiana was agitated, those around her tended to be even more agitated.\\n\\n The queen shot out of her chair, so we all scrambled to our feet, hastily and clumsily. Amelia had just gotten her legs tucked underneath her, so she was especially awkward, which served her right. Jade Flower took a couple steps away from the rest of the vampires, but maybe she wanted more room in case she had to swing her sword. Andre was the only one who noticed that, besides me. He kept his gaze fixed on the king\u0027s bodyguard.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what would have happened next if Quinn hadn\u0027t driven through the gate.\\n\\n He got out of the big black car, ignored the tense tableau as if it didn\u0027t even exist, and strode across the gravel to me. He casually draped an arm over my shoulders and bent to give me a light kiss. I don\u0027t know how to compare one kiss to another. Men all kiss differently, don\u0027t they? And it says something about their character. Quinn kissed me as if we were carrying on a conversation.\\n\\n \"Babe,\" he said, when I\u0027d had the last word. \"Did I get here at a good time? What happened to your arm?\"\\n\\n The atmosphere relaxed a bit. I introduced him to the people standing in the courtyard. He knew all the vampires, but he hadn\u0027t met the witches. He moved away from me to meet and greet. Patsy and Amelia had obviously heard of him and tried hard not to act too impressed at meeting him.\\n\\n I had to get the rest of the evening\u0027s news off my chest. \"My arm got bitten, Quinn,\" I began. Quinn waited, his eyes intent on my face. \"I got bitten by a... I\u0027m afraid we know what happened to your employee. His name was Jake Purifoy, wasn\u0027t it?\" I said.\\n\\n \"What?\" In the bright lights of the courtyard, I saw that his expression was guarded. He knew something bad was coming; of course, seeing the assembled company, anyone would guess that.\\n\\n \"He was drained and left here in the courtyard. To save his life, Hadley turned him. He\u0027s become a vampire.\"\\n\\n Quinn didn\u0027t comprehend, for a few seconds. I watched as realization dawned as he grasped the enormity of what had happened to Jake Purifoy. Quinn\u0027s face became stony. I found myself hoping he never looked at me like that.\\n\\n \"The change was without the Were\u0027s consent,\" the queen said. \"Of course, a Were would never agree to become one of us.\" If she sounded a little snarky, I wasn\u0027t too surprised. Weres and vamps regarded each other with scarcely concealed disgust, and only the fact that they were united against the normal world kept that disgust from flaring into open warfare.\\n\\n \"I went by your house,\" Quinn said to me, unexpectedly. \"I wanted to see if you\u0027d gotten back from New Orleans before I drove down here to look for Jake. Who burned a demon in your driveway?\"\\n\\n \"Someone killed Gladiola, the queen\u0027s messenger, when she came to deliver a message to me,\" I said. There was a stir among the vampires around me. The queen had known about Gladiola\u0027s death, of course; Mr. Cataliades would have been sure to tell her. But no one else had heard about it.\\n\\n \"Lots of people dying in your yard, babe,\" Quinn said to me, though his tone was absent, and I didn\u0027t blame him for that being on his back burner.\\n\\n \"Just two,\" I said defensively, after a quick mental rundown. \"I would hardly call that a lot.\" Of course, if you threw in the people who\u0027d died in the house... I quickly shut off that train of thought.\\n\\n \"You know what?\" Amelia said in a high, artificially social voice. \"I think we witches will just mosey on down the street to that pizza place on the corner of Chloe and Justine. So if you need us, there we\u0027ll be. Right, guys?\" Bob, Patsy, and Terry moved faster than I\u0027d thought they were able to the gate opening, and when the vampires didn\u0027t get any signal from their queen, they stood aside and let them by. Since Amelia didn\u0027t bother retrieving her purse, I hoped she had money in one pocket and her keys in another. Oh well.\\n\\n I almost wished I were trailing along behind them. Wait a minute! Why couldn\u0027t I? I looked longingly at the gate, but Jade Flower stepped into the gap and stared at me, her eyes black holes in her round face. This was a woman who didn\u0027t like me one little bit. Andre, Sigebert, and Wybert could definitely take me or leave me, and Rasul might think I wouldn\u0027t be a bad companion for an hour on the town - but Jade Flower would enjoy whacking off my head with her sword, and that was a fact. I couldn\u0027t read vampire minds (except for a tiny glimpse every now and then, which was a big secret) but I could read body language and I could read the expression in her eyes.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know the reason for this animosity, and at this point in time I didn\u0027t think it mattered a heck of a lot.\\n\\n The queen had been thinking. She said, \"Rasul, we shall go back to the house very shortly.\" He bowed and walked out to the car.\\n\\n \"Miss Stackhouse,\" she said, turning her eyes on me. They shone like dark lamps. She took my hand, and we went up the stairs to Hadley\u0027s apartment, Andre trailing behind us like something tied to Sophie-Anne\u0027s leg with string. I kept having the unwise impulse to yank my hand from the queen\u0027s, which of course was cold and dry and strong, though she was careful not to squeeze. Being so close to the ancient vampire made me vibrate like a violin string. I didn\u0027t see how Hadley had endured it.\\n\\n She led me into Hadley\u0027s apartment and shut the door behind us. I didn\u0027t think even the excellent ears of the vampires below us could hear our conversation now. That had been her goal, because the first thing she said was, \"You will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, mute with apprehension.\\n\\n \"I began my life in what became northern France, about... one thousand, one hundred years ago.\"\\n\\n I gulped.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know where I was, of course, but I think it was Lotharingia. In the last century I tried to find the place I spent my first twelve years, but I couldn\u0027t, even if my life depended on it.\" She gave a barking laugh at the turn of phrase. \"My mother was the wife of the wealthiest man in the town, which meant he had two more pigs than anyone else. My name then was Judith.\"\\n\\n I tried hard not to look shocked, to just look interested, but it was a struggle.\\n\\n \"When I was about ten or twelve, I think, a peddler came to us from down the road. We hadn\u0027t seen a new face in six months. We were excited.\" But she didn\u0027t smile or look as if she remembered the feeling of that excitement, only the fact of it. Her shoulders rose and fell, once. \"He carried an illness that had never come to us before. I think now that it was some form of influenza. Within two weeks of his stay in our town, everyone in it was dead, excepting me and a boy somewhat older.\"\\n\\n There was a moment of silence while we thought about that. At least I did, and I suppose the queen was remembering. Andre might have been thinking about the price of bananas in Guatemala.\\n\\n \"Clovis did not like me,\" the queen said. \"I\u0027ve forgotten why. Our fathers... I don\u0027t remember. Things might have gone differently if he had cared for me. As it was, he raped me and then he took me to the next town, where he began offering me about. For money, of course, or food. Though the influenza traveled across our region, we never got sick.\"\\n\\n I tried to look anywhere but at her.\\n\\n \"Why will you not meet my eyes?\" she demanded. Her phrasing and her accent had changed as she spoke, as if she\u0027d just learned English.\\n\\n \"I feel so bad for you,\" I said.\\n\\n She made a sound that involved putting her top teeth on her lower lip and making the extra effort to intake some air so she could blow it out. It sounded like \"fffft!\" \"Don\u0027t bother,\" the queen said. \"Because what happened next was, we were camped in the woods, and a vampire got him.\" She looked pleased at the recollection. What a trip down memory lane. \"The vampire was very hungry and started on Clovis first, because he was bigger, but when he was through with Clovis, he could take a minute to look at me and think it might be nice to have a companion. His name was Alain. For three years or more I traveled with Alain. Vampires were secret then, of course. Their existence was only in stories told by old women by the fire. And Alain was good at keeping it that way. Alain had been a priest, and he was very fond of surprising priests in their beds.\" She smiled reminiscently.\\n\\n I found my sympathy diminishing.\\n\\n \"Alain promised and promised to bring me over, because of course I wanted to be as he was. I wanted the strength.\" Her eyes flicked over to me.\\n\\n I nodded heartily. I could understand that.\\n\\n \"But when he needed money, for clothes and food for me, he would do the same thing with me that Clovis had, sell me for money. He knew the men would notice if I was cold, and he knew I would bite them if he brought me over. I grew tired of his failing in his promise.\"\\n\\n I nodded to show her I was paying attention. And I was, but in the back of my mind I was wondering where the hell this monologue was heading and why I was the recipient of such a fascinating and depressing story.\\n\\n \"Then one night we came into a village where the head-man knew Alain for what he was. Stupid Alain had forgotten he had passed through before and drained the headman\u0027s wife! So the villagers bound him with a silver chain, which was amazing to find in a small village, I can tell you... and they threw him into a hut, planning to keep him until the village priest returned from a trip. Then they meant to put him in the sun with some church ceremony. It was a poor village, but on top of him they piled all the bits of silver and all the garlic the people possessed, in an effort to keep him subdued.\" The queen chuckled.\\n\\n \"They knew I was a human, and they knew he had abused me,\" she said. \"So they didn\u0027t tie me up. The headman\u0027s family discussed taking me as a slave, since they had lost a woman to the vampire. I knew what that would be like.\"\\n\\n The expression on her face was both heartbreaking and absolutely chilling. I held very still.\\n\\n \"That night, I pulled out some weak planks from the rear of the hut and crawled in. I told Alain that when he\u0027d brought me over, I\u0027d free him. We bargained for quite a time, and then he agreed. I dug a hole in the floor, big enough for my body. We planned that Alain would drain me and bury me under the pallet he lay on, smoothing the dirt floor over as best he could. He could move enough for that. On the third night, I would rise. I would break his chain and toss away the garlic, though it would burn my hands. We would flee into the darkness.\" She laughed out loud. \"But the priest returned before three days were up. By the time I clawed my way out of the dirt, Alain was blackened ash in the wind. It was the priest\u0027s hut they\u0027d stored Alain in. The old priest was the one who told me what had happened.\"\\n\\n I had a feeling I knew the punch line to this story. \"Okay,\" I said quickly, \"I guess the priest was your first meal.\" I smiled brightly.\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" said Sophie-Anne, formerly Judith. \"I told him I was the angel of death, and that I was passing him over since he had been so virtuous.\"\\n\\n Considering the state Jake Purifoy had been in when he\u0027d risen for the first time, I could appreciate what a gut-wrenching effort that must have been for the new vampire.\\n\\n \"What did you do next?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"After a few years, I found an orphan like me; roaming in the woods, like me,\" she said, and turned to look at her bodyguard. \"We\u0027ve been together ever since.\"\\n\\n And I finally saw an expression in Andre\u0027s unlined face: utter devotion.\\n\\n \"He was being forced, like I had been,\" she said gently. \"And I took care of that.\"\\n\\n I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. I couldn\u0027t have picked something to say if you had paid me.\\n\\n \"The reason I\u0027ve bored you with my ancient history,\" the queen said, shaking herself and sitting up even straighter, \"is to tell you why I took Hadley under my wing. She, too, had been molested, by her great-uncle. Did he molest you, too?\"\\n\\n I nodded. I\u0027d had no idea he\u0027d gotten to Hadley. He hadn\u0027t progressed to actual penetration, only because my parents had died and I\u0027d gone to live with my grandmother. My parents hadn\u0027t believed me, but I\u0027d convinced my grandmother I was telling the truth by the time he would have felt I was ripe, when I was about nine. Of course, Hadley had been older. We\u0027d had much more in common than I\u0027d ever thought. \"I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Thanks for telling me.\"\\n\\n \"Hadley talked about you often,\" the queen said.\\n\\n Yeah, thanks, Hadley. Thanks for setting me up for the worst... no, wait, that was unfair. Finding out about Bill\u0027s massive deception was not the worst thing that had ever happened to me. But it wasn\u0027t too far down on my personal list, either.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve found out,\" I said, my voice as cold and crisp as a celery stick.\\n\\n \"You are upset that I sent Bill to investigate you, to find out if you could be of use to me,\" the queen said.\\n\\n I took a deep breath, forced my teeth to unclench. \"No, I\u0027m not upset with you. You can\u0027t help being the way you are. And you didn\u0027t even know me.\" Another deep breath. \"I\u0027m upset with Bill, who did know me and went ahead with your whole program in a very thorough and calculated way.\" I had to drive away the pain. \"Besides, why would you care?\" My tone was bordering on insolent, which was not wise when you\u0027re dealing with a powerful vampire. She\u0027d touched me in a very sore spot.\\n\\n \"Because you were dear to Hadley,\" Sophie-Anne said unexpectedly.\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t have known it from the way she treated me, after she became a teenager,\" I said, having apparently decided that reckless honesty was the course to follow.\\n\\n \"She was sorry for that,\" the queen said, \"once she became a vampire, especially, and found out what it was like to be a minority. Even here in New Orleans, there is prejudice. We talked about her life often, when we were alone.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know which made me more uncomfortable, the idea of the queen and my cousin Hadley having sex, or having pillow talk about me afterward.\\n\\n I don\u0027t care if consenting adults have sex, no matter what that sex consists of, as long as both parties agree beforehand. But I don\u0027t necessarily need to hear any details, either. Any prurient interest I might have had has been flooded over the years with images from the minds of the people in the bar.\\n\\n This was turning out to be a long conversation. I wanted the queen to get to the point.\\n\\n \"The point is,\" the queen said, \"I am grateful that you - through the witches - gave me a better idea of how Hadley died. And also you have let me know there is a wider plot against me than just Waldo\u0027s jealous heart.\"\\n\\n I had?\\n\\n \"So I am in your debt. Tell me what I can do for you now.\"\\n\\n \"Ah. Send over a lot of boxes so I can pack up Hadley\u0027s stuff and get back to Bon Temps? Get someone to take the stuff I don\u0027t want to a charity drop-off?\"\\n\\n The queen looked down, and I swear she was smothering a smile. \"Yes, I think I can do that,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll send some human over tomorrow to do those things.\"\\n\\n \"If someone could pack the stuff I want into a van and drive it up to Bon Temps, that would be real good,\" I said. \"Maybe I could ride back in that van?\"\\n\\n \"Also not a problem,\" she said.\\n\\n Now for the big favor. \"Do I actually have to go with you to this conference thing?\" I asked, which I knew was kind of pushing it.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said.\\n\\n Okay, stonewall there.\\n\\n She added, \"But I\u0027ll pay you handsomely.\"\\n\\n I brightened. Some of the money I\u0027d gotten for my previous vampire services was still in my savings account, and I\u0027d gotten a big financial break when Tara \"sold\" me her car for a dollar, but I was so used to living close to the financial bone that a cushion was always welcome. I was always scared I\u0027d break my leg, or my car would throw a rod, or my house would burn down... wait, that had already happened... well, that some disaster would happen, like a high wind would blow off the stupid tin roof my grandmother had insisted on, or something.\\n\\n \"Did you want something of Hadley\u0027s?\" I asked her, my train of thought having veered away from money. \"You know, a remembrance?\"\\n\\n Something flashed in her eyes, something that surprised me.\\n\\n \"You took the words right out of my mouth,\" said the queen, with an adorable hint of a French accent.\\n\\n Uh-oh. It couldn\u0027t be good that she\u0027d switched on the charm.\\n\\n \"I did ask Hadley to hide something for me,\" she said. My bullshit meter was beeping like an alarm clock. \"And if you come across it in your packing, I\u0027d like to have it back.\"\\n\\n \"What does it look like?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a jewel,\" she said. \"My husband gave it to me as an engagement gift. I happened to leave it here before I got married.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome to look in Hadley\u0027s jewelry box,\" I said immediately. \"If it belongs to you, of course you have to have it back.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s very kind of you,\" she said, her face back to its regular glassy smoothness. \"It\u0027s a diamond, a large diamond, and it\u0027s fixed on a platinum bracelet.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t remember anything like that in Hadley\u0027s stuff, but I hadn\u0027t looked carefully. I\u0027d planned to pack Hadley\u0027s jewelry box intact so I could pick through it at my leisure in Bon Temps.\\n\\n \"Please, look now,\" I suggested. \"I know that it would be like a faux pas to lose a present from your husband.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said gently, \"you have no idea.\" Sophie-Anne closed her eyes for just a second, as if she were too anxious for words. \"Andre,\" she said, and with that word he took off for the bedroom - didn\u0027t need any directions, I noticed - and while he was gone, the queen looked oddly incomplete. I wondered why he hadn\u0027t accompanied her to Bon Temps, and on an impulse, I asked her.\\n\\n She looked at me, her crystalline eyes wide and blank. \"I was not supposed to be gone,\" she said. \"I knew if Andre showed himself in New Orleans, everyone would assume I was here, too.\" I wondered if the reverse would be true. If the queen was here, would everyone assume Andre was, also? And that sparked a thought in me, a thought that had gone before I could quite grasp hold of it.\\n\\n Andre came back at that moment, the tiniest shake of his head telling the queen he hadn\u0027t found what she wanted to reclaim. For a moment, Sophie-Anne looked quite unhappy. \"Hadley did this in a minute of anger,\" the queen said, and I thought she was talking to herself. \"But she may bring me down from beyond the veil.\" Then her face relaxed into its usual emotionless state.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep an eye open for the bracelet,\" I said. I suspected that the value of the jewelry did not lie in its appraisal. \"Would that bracelet have been left here the last night before the wedding?\" I asked cautiously.\\n\\n I suspected my cousin Hadley had stolen the bracelet from the queen out of sheer pique that the queen was getting married. That seemed like a Hadley thing to do. If I\u0027d known about Hadley\u0027s concealment of the bracelet, I would have asked the witches to roll the clock back on the ectoplasmic reconstruction. We could have watched Hadley hide the thing.\\n\\n The queen gave one short nod. \"I must have it back,\" the queen said. \"You understand, it\u0027s not the value of the diamond that concerns me? You understand, a wedding between vampire rulers is not a love match, where much can be forgiven? To lose a gift from your spouse, that\u0027s a very grave offense. And our spring ball is scheduled for two nights from now. The king expects to see me wearing his gifts. If I\u0027m not...\" Her voice trailed away, and even Andre looked almost worried.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting your point,\" I said. I\u0027d noticed the tension already rolling through the halls at Sophie\u0027s headquarters. There\u0027d be hell to pay, and Sophie-Anne would be the one to pay it. \"If it\u0027s here, you\u0027ll get it back. Okay?\" I spread my hands, asking her if she believed me.\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said. \"Andre, I can\u0027t spend any more time here. Jade Flower will report the fact that I came up here with Sookie. Sookie, we must pretend to have had sex.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, anyone who knows me knows I don\u0027t do women. I don\u0027t know who you expect Jade Flower\u0027s reporting to...\" (Of course I did, and that would be the king, but it didn\u0027t seem tactful to say \"I know your business,\" just then.) \"But if they\u0027ve done any homework, that\u0027s just a fact about me.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you had sex with Andre, then,\" she said calmly. \"And you let me watch.\"\\n\\n I thought of several questions, the first one being, \"Is that the usual procedure with you?\" followed by, \"It\u0027s not okay to misplace a bracelet, but okay to bump pelvises with someone else?\" But I clamped my mouth shut. If someone were holding a gun to my head, I\u0027d actually have to vote for having sex with the queen rather than with Andre, no matter what my gender preference, because Andre creeped me out big-time. But if we were just pretending...\\n\\n In a businesslike way, Andre removed his tie, folded it, put it in his pocket, and undid a few shirt buttons. He beckoned to me with a crook of his fingers. I approached him warily. He took me in his arms and held me close, pressed against him, and bent his head to my neck. For a second I thought he was going to bite, and I had a flare of absolute panic, but instead he inhaled. That\u0027s a deliberate act for a vampire.\\n\\n \"Put your mouth on my neck,\" he said, after another long whiff of me. \"Your lipstick will transfer.\"\\n\\n I did as he told me. He was cold as ice. This was like... well, this was just weird. I thought of the picture-taking session with Claude; I\u0027d spent a lot of time lately pretending to have sex.\\n\\n \"I love the smell of fairy. Do you think she knows she has fairy blood?\" he asked Sophie-Anne, while I was in the process of transferring my lipstick.\\n\\n My head snapped back then. I stared right into his eyes, and he stared right back at me. He was still holding me, and I understood that he was ensuring I would smell like him and he would smell like me, as if we\u0027d actually done the deed. He definitely wasn\u0027t up for the real thing, which was a relief.\\n\\n \"I what?\" I hadn\u0027t heard him correctly, I was sure. \"I have what?\"\\n\\n \"He has a nose for it,\" the queen said. \"My Andre.\" She looked faintly proud.\\n\\n \"I was hanging around with my friend Claudine earlier in the day,\" I said. \"She\u0027s a fairy. That\u0027s where the smell is coming from.\" I really must need to shower.\\n\\n \"You permit?\" Andre asked, and without waiting for an answer, he jabbed my wounded arm with a fingernail, right above the bandage.\\n\\n \"Yow!\" I said in protest.\\n\\n He let a little blood trickle onto his finger, and he put it in his mouth. He rolled it around, as if it were a sip of wine, and at last he said, \"No, this smell of fairy is not from association. It\u0027s in your blood.\" Andre looked at me in a way that was meant to tell me that his words made it a done deal. \"You have a little streak of fairy. Maybe your grandmother or your grandfather was half-fey?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about it,\" I said, knowing I sounded stupid, but not knowing what else to say. \"If any of my grandparents were other than a hundred percent human, they didn\u0027t pass that information along.\"\\n\\n \"No, they wouldn\u0027t,\" the queen said, matter-of-factly. \"Most humans of fairy descent hide the fact, because they don\u0027t really believe it. They prefer to think their parents are mad.\" She shrugged. Inexplicable! \"But that blood would explain why you have supernatural suitors and not human admirers.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have human admirers because I don\u0027t want \u0027em,\" I said, definitely piqued. \"I can read their minds, and that just knocks them out of the running. If they\u0027re not put off from the get-go by my reputation for weirdness,\" I added, back into my too-much-honesty groove.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a sad comment on humans that none of them are tolerable to one who can read their minds,\" the queen said.\\n\\n I guess that was the final word on the value of mind-reading ability. I decided it would be better to stop the conversation. I had a lot to think about.\\n\\n We went down the stairs, Andre leading, the queen next, and me trailing behind. Andre had insisted I take off my shoes and my earrings so it could be inferred that I had undressed and then just slipped back into the dress.\\n\\n The other vampires were waiting obediently in the courtyard, and they sprang to attention when we began making our way down. Jade Flower\u0027s face didn\u0027t change at all when she read all the clues as to what we\u0027d been up to in the past half hour, but at least she didn\u0027t look skeptical. The Berts looked knowing but uninterested, as if the scenario of Sophie-Anne watching her bodyguard engaging in sex (with a virtual stranger) were very much a matter of routine.\\n\\n As he stood in the gateway waiting for further driving instructions, Rasul\u0027s face expressed a mild ruefulness, as if he wished he had been included in the action. Quinn, on the other hand, was pressing his mouth in such a grim line that you couldn\u0027t have fed him a straight pin. There was a fence to mend.\\n\\n But as we\u0027d walked out of Hadley\u0027s apartment, the queen had told me specifically not to share her story with anyone else, emphasis on the anyone. I would just have to think of a way to let Quinn know, without letting him know.\\n\\n With no discussion or social chitchat, the vampires piled into their car. My brain was so crowded with ideas and conjectures and everything in between that I felt punch-drunk. I wanted to call my brother, Jason, and tell him he wasn\u0027t so irresistible after all, it was the fairy blood in him, just to see what he\u0027d say. No, wait, Andre had implied that humans weren\u0027t affected by the nearness of fairies like vampires were. That is, humans didn\u0027t want to consume fairies, but did find them sexually attractive. (I thought of the crowd that always surrounded Claudine at Merlotte\u0027s.) And Andre had said that other supernaturals were attracted by fairy blood too, just not in the eat-\u0027em-up way that vamps were. Wouldn\u0027t Eric be relieved? He would be so glad to know he didn\u0027t really love me! It was the fairy blood all along!\\n\\n I watched the royal limo drive away. While I was fighting a wave compounded of about six different emotions, Quinn was fighting only one.\\n\\n He was right in front of me, his face angry. \"How\u0027d she talk you into it, Sookie?\" he asked. \"If you\u0027d yelled, I\u0027d have been right up there. Or maybe you wanted to do that? I would have sworn you weren\u0027t the type.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t gone to bed with anyone this evening,\" I said. I looked him straight in the eyes. After all, this wasn\u0027t revealing anything the queen had told me, this was just... correcting an error. \"It\u0027s fine if others think that,\" I said carefully. \"Just not you.\"\\n\\n He looked down at me for a long moment, his eyes searching mine as if he were reading some writing on the back of my eyeballs.\\n\\n \"Would you like to go to bed with someone this evening?\" he asked. He kissed me. He kissed me for a long, long time, as we stood glued together in the courtyard. The witches did not return; the vampires stayed gone. Only the occasional car going by in the street or a siren heard in the distance reminded me we were in the middle of a city. This was as different from being held by Andre as I could imagine. Quinn was warm, and I could feel his muscles move beneath his skin. I could hear him breathe, and I could feel his heartbeat. I could sense the churn of his thoughts, which were mostly now centered on the bed he knew must be somewhere upstairs in Hadley\u0027s apartment. He loved the smell of me, the touch of me, the way my lips felt... and a large part of Quinn was attesting to that fact. That large part was pressed between us right at this very moment.\\n\\n I\u0027d gone to bed with two other males, and both times it hadn\u0027t worked out well. I hadn\u0027t known enough about them. I\u0027d acted on impulse. You should learn from your mistakes. For a second, I wasn\u0027t feeling especially smart.\\n\\n Luckily for my decision-making ability, Quinn\u0027s phone chose that moment to ring. God bless that phone. I\u0027d been within an ace of chucking my good resolutions right out the window, because I\u0027d been scared and lonely throughout the evening, and Quinn felt relatively familiar and he wanted me so much.\\n\\n Quinn, however, was not following the same thought processes - far from it - and he cursed when the phone rang a second time.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" he said, fury in his voice, and answered the damn phone.\\n\\n \"All right,\" he said, after listening for a moment to the voice on the other end. \"All right, I\u0027ll be there.\"\\n\\n He snapped the tiny phone shut. \"Jake is asking for me,\" he said.\\n\\n I was so at sea with a strange combination of lust and relief that it took me a moment to connect the dots. Jake Purifoy, Quinn\u0027s employee, was experiencing his second night as a vampire. Having been fed some volunteer, he was enough himself to want to talk to Quinn. He\u0027d been in suspended animation in a closet for weeks, and there was a lot he would need to catch up on.\\n\\n \"Then you have to go,\" I said, proud that my voice was practically rock steady. \"Maybe he\u0027ll remember who attacked him. Tomorrow, I have to tell you about what I saw here tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Would you have said yes?\" he asked. \"If we\u0027d been undisturbed for another minute?\"\\n\\n I considered for a minute. \"If I had, I would\u0027ve been sorry I did,\" I said. \"Not because I don\u0027t want you. I do. But I had my eyes opened in the past couple of days. I know that I\u0027m pretty easy to fool.\" I tried to sound matter-of-fact, not pitiful, when I said that. No one likes a whiny woman, least of all me. \"I\u0027m not interested in starting that up with someone who\u0027s just horny at the moment. I never set out to be a one-night-stand kind of woman. I want to be sure, if I have sex with you, that it\u0027s because you want to be around for a while and because you like me for who I am, not what I am.\"\\n\\n Maybe a million women had made approximately the same speech. I meant it as sincerely as any one of those million.\\n\\n And Quinn gave a perfect answer. \"Who would want just one night with you?\" he said, and then he left. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-18.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) \\n As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
