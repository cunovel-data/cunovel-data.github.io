{"id":101251,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I was glad Jason was a little late. I\u0027d finished the bacon and I was putting the hamburgers in the frying pan when he arrived. I had already opened the package of buns and put two on Jason\u0027s plate, and put a bag of potato chips on the table. I\u0027d poured him a glass of tea and set it beside his place. Jason came in without knocking, as he always did. Jason hadn\u0027t changed that much, at least to the eyes, since he\u0027d become a werepanther. He was still blond and attractive, and I mean attractive in the old way; he was good to look at, but he was also the kind of man that everyone looks at when he comes into a room. On top of that, he\u0027d always had a mean streak. But since his change, he\u0027d somehow been acting like a better person. I hadn\u0027t decided why that was. Maybe being a wild animal once a month satisfied some craving he hadn\u0027t known he had. Since he\u0027d been bitten, not born, he didn\u0027t change completely; he became a sort of hybrid. At first, he\u0027d been disappointed about that. But he\u0027d gotten over it. He\u0027d been dating a full werepanther named Crystal for several months now. Crystal lived in a tiny community some miles out in the country - and let me tell you, out in the country from Bon Temps, Louisiana, is really out in the country. We said a brief prayer and began eating. Jason didn\u0027t dig in with his usual gusto. Since the hamburger tasted good to me, I figured whatever was on his mind was important. I couldn\u0027t read it out of his brain. Since my brother had become a Were, his thoughts had not been as clear to me. Mostly, that was a relief. After two bites, Jason put down his hamburger, and his body posture changed. He was ready to talk. \"I got something I got to tell you,\" he said. \"Crystal doesn\u0027t want me to tell anyone, but I\u0027m really worried about her. Yesterday, Crystal... she had a miscarriage.\" I shut my eyes for a few seconds. I had about twenty thoughts in that brief time, and I couldn\u0027t complete a one of them. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said. \"I hope Crystal\u0027s all right?\" Jason looked at me over a plate of food he\u0027d completely forgotten. \"She won\u0027t go to the doctor.\" I stared at him blankly. \"But she has to,\" I said reasonably. \"She needs a D \u0026 C.\" I wasn\u0027t sure what \"D \u0026 C\" stood for, but I knew after you\u0027d miscarried, you went to a hospital and that\u0027s what they did there. My friend and co-worker Arlene had had a D \u0026 C after her miscarriage, and she\u0027d told me about it several times. Several times. \"They go in and...\" I began, but Jason cut me off in midstream. \"Hey, I don\u0027t need to know,\" he said, looking very uncomfortable. \"I just know that since Crystal\u0027s a werepanther, she didn\u0027t want to go to the hospital. She had to go when she got gored by that razorback, just like Calvin had to go when he got shot, but they both got well so fast that there was some comment in the doctors\u0027 lounge, she heard. So she won\u0027t go now. She\u0027s at my house, but she\u0027s... she\u0027s not doing well. She\u0027s getting worse, not better.\" \"Uh-oh,\" I said. \"So what\u0027s happening?\" \"She\u0027s bleeding too heavy, and her legs don\u0027t work right.\" He swallowed. \"She can hardly stand up, much less walk.\" \"Have you called Calvin?\" I asked. Calvin Norris, Crystal\u0027s uncle, is the leader of the tiny Hotshot panther community. \"She don\u0027t want me to tell Calvin. She\u0027s scared Calvin\u0027ll kill me for knocking her up. Crystal didn\u0027t want me to tell you, either, but I got to have help.\" Though her mom wasn\u0027t living, Crystal had female relatives galore in Hotshot. I\u0027d never had a baby, I\u0027d never even been pregnant, and I wasn\u0027t a shifter. Any one of them would know more about the situation than I did. I told Jason this. \"I don\u0027t want her to sit up long enough to go back to Hotshot, specially in my truck.\" My brother looked as stubborn as a mule. For an awful minute, I thought that Jason\u0027s big concern was Crystal bleeding on his upholstery. I was about to hop down his throat, when he added, \"The shocks need replacing, and I\u0027m scared the bouncing of the truck on that bad road would make Crystal worse.\" Then her kin could come to Crystal. But I knew before I spoke that Jason would find a reason to veto that, too. He had some kind of plan. \"Okay. What can I do?\" \"Didn\u0027t you tell me that time when you got hurt, there was a special kind of doctor the vamps called to look at your back?\" I didn\u0027t like to think about that night. My back still bore the scars of the attack. The poison on the maenad\u0027s claws had nearly killed me. \"Yes,\" I said slowly, \"Dr. Ludwig.\" Doctor to all that was weird and strange, Dr. Ludwig was herself an oddity. She was extremely short - very, very short. And her features were not exactly regular, either. It would come as an extreme surprise to me if Dr. Ludwig were at all human. I\u0027d seen her a second time at the contest for pack-master. Both times, I\u0027d been in Shreveport; so the chances were good that Dr. Ludwig actually lived there. Since I didn\u0027t want to overlook the obvious, I fished a Shreveport directory out of the drawer below the wall-mounted telephone. There was a listing for a Doctor Amy Ludwig. Amy? I bit back a burst of laughter. I was very nervous about approaching Dr. Ludwig on my own, but when I saw how worried Jason was, I couldn\u0027t protest over making one lousy phone call. It rang four times. A machine picked up. A mechanical voice said, \"You have reached the telephone of Dr. Amy Ludwig. Dr. Ludwig is not accepting new patients, insured or uninsured. Dr. Ludwig does not want pharmaceutical samples, and she does not need insurance of any kind. She is not interested in investing her money, or giving to charities she hasn\u0027t personally selected.\" There was a long silence, during which time most callers presumably hung up. I didn\u0027t. After a moment, I heard another click on the line. \"Hello?\" asked a gruff little voice. \"Dr. Ludwig?\" I asked cautiously. \"Yes? I don\u0027t accept new patients, you know! Too busy!\" She sounded both impatient and cautious. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse. Is this the Dr. Ludwig who treated me in Eric\u0027s office at Fangtasia?\" \"You are the young woman poisoned by the maenad\u0027s claws?\" \"Yes. I saw you again a few weeks ago, remember?\" \"And where was that?\" She remembered quite well, but she wanted another proof of my identity. \"An empty building in an industrial park.\" \"And who was running the show there?\" \"A big bald guy named Quinn.\" \"Oh, all right.\" She sighed. \"What do you want? I\u0027m rather busy.\" \"I have a patient for you. Please come to see her.\" \"Bring her to me.\" \"She\u0027s too sick to travel.\" I heard the doctor muttering to herself, but I couldn\u0027t make out the words. \"Pooh,\" the doctor said. \"Oh, very well, Miss Stackhouse. Tell me what the problem is.\" I explained as best I could. Jason was moving around the kitchen, because he was too worried to sit still. \"Idiots. Fools,\" Dr. Ludwig said. \"Tell me how to get to your house. Then you can take me where the girl is.\" \"I may have to leave for work before you can get here,\" I said, after glancing at the clock and calculating how long it would take the doctor to drive from Shreveport. \"My brother will be here waiting.\" \"Is he the responsible party?\" I didn\u0027t know if she was talking about the bill for her services, or the pregnancy. Either way, I told her that Jason definitely was the responsible party. \"She\u0027s coming,\" I told my brother, after I\u0027d given the doctor directions and hung up. \"I don\u0027t know how much she charges, but I told her you\u0027d pay.\" \"Sure, sure. How will I know her?\" \"You can\u0027t mistake her for anyone you know. She said she\u0027d have a driver. She wouldn\u0027t be tall enough to see over the steering wheel, so I should have figured on that.\" I did the dishes while Jason fidgeted. He called Crystal to check on her, seemed okay with what he\u0027d heard. Finally, I asked him to go outside and knock old dirt-dauber nests off the tool shed. He couldn\u0027t seem to settle down, so he might as well be useful. I thought about the situation while I started a load of laundry and put on my barmaid outfit (black pants, white boat-neck tee with Merlotte\u0027s embroidered over the left breast, black Adidas). I was not a happy camper. I was worried about Crystal - and I didn\u0027t like her. I was sorry she\u0027d lost the baby because I know that\u0027s a sad experience, but I was happy because I really didn\u0027t want Jason to marry the girl, and I was pretty sure he would have if the pregnancy had continued. I cast around for something to make me feel better. I opened the closet to look at my new outfit, the one I\u0027d bought at Tara\u0027s Togs to wear on my date. But I couldn\u0027t even get any enjoyment out of it. Finally, I did what I\u0027d planned on doing before I\u0027d heard Jason\u0027s news: I got a book and settled in a chair on the front porch, reading a few sentences every now and then in between admiring the pear tree in the front yard, which was covered in white blossoms and humming with bees. The sun was beaming, the daffodils were just past their prime, and I had a date for Friday. And I\u0027d already done my good deed for the day, in calling Dr. Ludwig. The coil of worry in my stomach eased up a little. From time to time, I could hear vague sounds traveling my way from the backyard; Jason had found something to keep him occupied after he\u0027d dealt with the nests. Maybe he was pulling up weeds in the flower beds. I brightened. That would be nice, since I didn\u0027t have my grandmother\u0027s enthusiasm for gardening. I admired the results, but I didn\u0027t enjoy the whole process as she had. After checking my watch repeatedly, I was relieved to see a rather grand pearl Cadillac pull into the front parking area. There was a tiny shape in the front passenger seat. The driver\u0027s door opened, and a Were named Amanda got out. She and I had had our differences, but we\u0027d parted on fair terms. I was relieved to see someone I knew. Amanda, who looked exactly like a middle-class soccer mom, was in her thirties. Her red hair looked natural, quite unlike my friend Arlene\u0027s. \"Sookie, hey,\" she said. \"When the doctor told me where we were going, I was relieved, since I knew how to get here already.\" \"You\u0027re not her usual driver? Hey, I like the haircut, by the way.\" \"Oh, thanks.\" Amanda\u0027s hair was newly short, cut in a careless, almost boyish style that oddly suited her. I say oddly, because Amanda\u0027s body was definitely womanly. \"Haven\u0027t got used to it yet,\" she admitted, running her hand over her neck. \"Actually, it\u0027s usually my oldest boy that drives Dr. Ludwig, but he\u0027s in school today, of course. Is it your sister-in-law that\u0027s ailing?\" \"My brother\u0027s fiancee,\" I said, trying to put a good face on it. \"Crystal. She\u0027s a panther.\" Amanda looked almost respectful. Weres often have only contempt for other shape-shifters, but something as formidable as a panther would get their attention. \"I heard there was a cluster of panthers out here somewhere. Never met one before.\" \"I have to get to work, but my brother\u0027s going to lead you over to his place.\" \"So, you\u0027re not really close to your brother\u0027s fiancee?\" I was taken aback at the implication that I was less than concerned about Crystal\u0027s welfare. Maybe I should have hurried over to her bedside and left Jason here to guide the doctor? I suddenly saw my enjoyment of my moments of peace as a callous disregard for Crystal. But now was no time to wallow in guilt. \"Truthfully,\" I said, \"no, I\u0027m not that close to her. But Jason didn\u0027t seem to think there was anything I could do for her, and my presence wouldn\u0027t exactly be soothing since she\u0027s not any fonder of me than I am of her.\" Amanda shrugged. \"Okay, where is he?\" Jason came around the corner of the house just then, to my relief. \"Oh, great,\" he said. \"You\u0027re the doctor?\" \"No,\" Amanda said. \"The doctor\u0027s in the car. I\u0027m the driver today.\" \"I\u0027ll lead you over there. I been on the phone with Crystal, and she\u0027s not getting any better.\" I felt another wave of remorse. \"Call me at work, Jason, and let me know how she\u0027s doing, okay? I can come over after work and spend the night, if you need me.\" \"Thanks, Sis.\" He gave me a quick hug and then looked awkward. \"Uh, I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t keep it a secret like Crystal wanted me to. She didn\u0027t think you\u0027d help her.\" \"I\u0027d like to think I was at least a good enough person to help someone who needed it, no matter if we were close or not.\" Surely Crystal hadn\u0027t imagined that I\u0027d be indifferent, or even pleased, that she was ailing? Dismayed, I watched the two very different vehicles start down the driveway on their way back to Hummingbird Road. I locked up and got in my own car in no very happy mood. Continuing the theme of an eventful day, when I walked through the back door of Merlotte\u0027s that afternoon, Sam called to me from his office. I went in to see what he wanted, knowing ahead of time that a few other people were waiting in there. To my dismay, I found that Father Riordan had ambushed me. There were four people in Sam\u0027s office, besides my boss. Sam was unhappy, but trying to keep a good face on. A little to my surprise, Father Riordan wasn\u0027t happy about the people that had accompanied him, either. I suspected I knew who they were. Crap. Not only did Father Riordan have the Pelts in tow, but a young woman of about seventeen, who must be Debbie\u0027s sister, Sandra. The three new people looked at me intently. The older Pelts were tall and slim. He wore glasses and was balding, with ears that stuck out of his head like jug handles. She was attractive, if a bit overly made up. She was wearing a Donna Karan pants set and carrying a bag with a famous logo on it. Heels, too. Sandra Pelt was more casual, her jeans and T-shirt fitting her narrow figure very tightly. I hardly heard Father Riordan formally introduce the Pelts, I was so overwhelmed with irritation that they were intruding themselves into my life to such an extent. I\u0027d told Father Riordan I didn\u0027t want to meet them, yet here they were. The older Pelts ate me up with their avid eyes. Savage, Maria-Star had termed them. Desperate was the word that came to my mind. Sandra was a different kettle of fish altogether: since she was the second child, she wasn\u0027t - couldn\u0027t be - a shifter like her folks, but she wasn\u0027t altogether a regular human, either. But something caught at my brain, made me pause. Sandra Pelt was a shifter of some kind. I\u0027d heard the Pelts described as much more involved with their second daughter than they\u0027d been with Debbie. Now, getting bits of information from them, I saw why that might be. Sandra Pelt might be underage, but she was formidable. She was a full Were. But that couldn\u0027t be, unless... Okay. Debbie Pelt, werefox, had been adopted. I\u0027d learned that the Weres were prone to fertility problems, and I assumed that the Pelts had given up on having their own little Were, and had adopted a baby that was at least some kind of shape-shifter, if not their own kind. Even a full-blooded fox must have seemed preferable to a plain human. Then the Pelts had adopted another daughter, a Were. \"Sookie,\" Father Riordan said, his Irish voice charming but unhappy, \"Barbara and Gordon showed up on my doorstep today. When I told them you\u0027d said all you wanted to say about Debbie\u0027s disappearance, they weren\u0027t content with that. They insisted I bring them here with me.\" My intense anger at the priest receded a bit. But another emotion filled its place. I was anxious enough about the encounter to feel my nervous smile spread across my face. I beamed at the Pelts, caught the backwash of their disapproval. \"I\u0027m sorry for your situation,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re left wondering what happened to Debbie. But I don\u0027t know what else I can tell you.\" A tear ran down Barbara Pelt\u0027s face, and I opened my purse to remove a tissue. I handed it to the woman, who patted her face. \"She thought you were stealing Alcide from her,\" Barbara said. You\u0027re not supposed to speak ill of the dead, but in Debbie Pelt\u0027s case, that was just plain impossible. \"Mrs. Pelt, I\u0027m going to be frank,\" I told her. Just not too frank. \"Debbie was engaged to someone else at the time of her disappearance, a man named Clausen, if I remember correctly.\" Barbara Pelt nodded, reluctantly. \"That engagement left Alcide at perfect liberty to date anyone he liked, and we did spend time together briefly.\" No lies there. \"We haven\u0027t seen each other in weeks, and he\u0027s dating someone else now. So Debbie really was mistaken in what she thought.\" Sandra Pelt bit her lower lip. She was lean, with clear skin and dark brown hair. She wore little makeup, and her teeth were dazzlingly white and even. Her hoop earrings could provide a perch for a parakeet; they were that big. She had a narrow body and expensive clothes: top of the mall chain. Her expression was angry. She didn\u0027t like what I was saying, not one little bit. She was an adolescent, and there were strong surges of emotion in the girl. I remembered what my life had been like when I\u0027d been Sandra\u0027s age, and I pitied her. \"Since you knew both of them,\" Barbara Pelt said carefully, not acknowledging my words, \"you must have known that they had - they have - a strong love-hate relationship, no matter what Debbie did.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s true,\" I said, and maybe I didn\u0027t sound respectful enough. If there was anyone I\u0027d done a big favor to in killing Debbie Pelt, that person was Alcide Herveaux. Otherwise, he and la Pelt would have been tearing each other up for years, if not the rest of their lives. Sam turned away when the phone rang, but I glimpsed a smile on his face. \"We just feel that there must be something you know, some tiny little thing, that would help us discover what happened to our daughter. If - if she\u0027s met her end, we want her killer to come to justice.\" I looked at the Pelts for a long moment. I could hear Sam\u0027s voice in the background as he reacted with astonishment to something he was hearing over the telephone. \"Mr. and Mrs. Pelt, Sandra,\" I said. \"I talked to the police when Debbie vanished. I cooperated with them fully. I talked to your private investigators when they came here, to my place of work, just like you\u0027ve done. I let them come into my home. I answered their questions.\" Just not truthfully. (I know, the whole edifice was a lie, but I was doing the best I could.) \"I am very sorry for your loss and I sympathize with your anxiety to discover what\u0027s happened to Debbie,\" I continued, speaking slowly so I could pick my words. I took a deep breath. \"But this has got to end. Enough\u0027s enough. I can\u0027t tell you a thing other than what I\u0027ve already told you.\" To my surprise, Sam edged around me and went into the bar, moving fast. He didn\u0027t say a word to anyone in the room. Father Riordan glanced after him, startled. I became even more anxious for the Pelts to leave. Something was up. \"I understand what you\u0027re saying,\" Gordon Pelt said stiffly. It was the first time the man had spoken. He didn\u0027t sound happy to be where he was, or to be doing what he was doing. \"I realize we haven\u0027t gone about this in the best way, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll excuse us when you think about what we\u0027ve been through.\" \"Oh, of course,\" I said, and if that wasn\u0027t a complete truth, it wasn\u0027t a complete lie, either. I shut my purse and stowed it in the drawer in Sam\u0027s desk where all the servers kept their purses, and I hurried out to the bar. I felt the upheaval wash over me. Something was wrong; almost every brain in the bar was broadcasting a signal combining excitement with anxiety bordering on panic. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked Sam, sidling behind the bar. \"I just told Holly that the school called. Holly\u0027s little boy is missing.\" I felt the chill start at the base of my spine and work up. \"What happened?\" \"Danielle\u0027s mom usually picks up Cody from school when she picks up Danielle\u0027s little girl, Ashley.\" Danielle Gray and Holly Cleary had been best friends all through high school and their friendship had continued through the failure of both their marriages. They liked to work the same shift. Danielle\u0027s mother, Mary Jane Jasper, had been a life-saver for Danielle, and from time to time her generosity had spilled over to include Holly. Ashley must be about eight, and Danielle\u0027s son, Mark Robert, should now be four. Holly\u0027s only child, Cody, was six. He was in the first grade. \"The school let someone else pick Cody up?\" I\u0027d heard that the teachers were on the alert for unauthorized spouses picking up their kids. \"No one knows what happened to the little guy. The teacher on duty, Halleigh Robinson, was standing outside watching the kids get in their cars. She says Cody suddenly remembered he\u0027d left a picture for his mom on his desk, and he ran back into the school to get it. She doesn\u0027t remember seeing him come out, but she couldn\u0027t find him when she went in to check.\" \"So Mrs. Jasper was there waiting for Cody?\" \"Yes, she was the only one left, sitting there in her car with her grandchildren.\" \"This is very scary. I don\u0027t suppose David knows anything?\" David, Holly\u0027s ex, lived in Springhill and had remarried. I registered the departure of the Pelts: one less irritant. \"Apparently not. Holly called him at his job, and he was there and had been all afternoon, no doubt about it. He called his new wife, and she had just gotten back from picking up her own kids at the Springhill school. The local police went by their house and searched, just to be sure. Now David\u0027s on his way here.\" Holly was sitting at one of the tables, and though her face was dry, her eyes had the look of someone who\u0027d seen inside Hell. Danielle was crouched on the floor beside her, holding her hand and speaking to Holly urgently and quietly. Alcee Beck, one of the local detectives, was sitting at the same table. A pad and pen were in front of him, and he was talking on his cell phone. \"They\u0027ve searched the school?\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s where Andy is now. And Kevin and Kenya.\" Kevin and Kenya were two uniformed patrol officers. \"Bud Dearborn is on the phone setting up an Amber Alert.\" I spared a thought for how Halleigh must be feeling right now; she was only twenty-three or so, and this was her first teaching job. She hadn\u0027t done anything wrong, at least that I could tell - but when a kid goes missing, no one escapes blame. I tried to think how I could help. This was a unique opportunity for my little disability to work for the greater good. I\u0027d kept my mouth shut for years about all kinds of things. People didn\u0027t want to know what I knew. People didn\u0027t want to be around someone who could do what I could do. The way I survived was keeping my mouth shut, because it was easy for the humans around me to forget or disbelieve, when the evidence of my odd talent wasn\u0027t shoved in their face. Would you want to be around a woman who knew you were cheating on your spouse, and with whom? If you were a guy, would you want to be around a woman who knew that you secretly wanted to wear lacy underwear? Would you want to hang with a gal who knew your most secret judgments on other people and all your hidden flaws? No, I thought not. But if a child was involved, how could I hold back? I looked at Sam, and he looked back at me sadly. \"It\u0027s hard, isn\u0027t it, cher?\" he said. \"What are you going to do?\" \"Whatever I have to. But I have to do it now,\" I said. He nodded. \"Go on down to the school,\" he said, and I left.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-5.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
