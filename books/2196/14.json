{"id":101260,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Someone was pinching my toe and saying \"Wake up! Wake up!\" I roared back to consciousness in a terrified rush, my eyes opening on the unfamiliar room streaming with sunshine. A woman I didn\u0027t know was standing at the foot of the bed. \"Who the hell are you?\" I was irritated, but not scared. She didn\u0027t look dangerous. She was about my age, and she was very tan. Her chestnut hair was short, her eyes a bright blue, and she was wearing khaki shorts and a white shirt that hung open over a coral tank top. She was rushing the season a little. \"I\u0027m Amelia Broadway. I own the building.\" \"Why are you in here waking me up?\" \"I heard Cataliades in the courtyard last night, and I figured he\u0027d brought you back to clean out Hadley\u0027s apartment. I wanted to talk to you.\" \"And you couldn\u0027t wait until I woke up? And you used a key to get in, instead of ringing the doorbell? What\u0027s wrong with you?\" She was definitely startled. For the first time, Amelia Broadway looked as if she realized she could have handled the situation better. \"Well, see, I\u0027ve been worried,\" she said in a subdued way. \"Yeah? Me, too,\" I said. \"Join the club. I\u0027m plenty worried right now. Now get out of here and wait for me in the living room, okay?\" \"Sure,\" she said. \"I can do that.\" I let my heart rate get back to normal before I slid out of bed. Then I made the bed quickly and pulled some clothes out of my bag. I shuffled into the bathroom, catching a quick glimpse of my uninvited guest as I went from bedroom to bath. She was dusting the living room with a cloth that looked suspiciously like a man\u0027s flannel shirt. O-kay. I showered as quickly as I could, slapped on a little makeup, and came out barefoot but clad in jeans and a blue T-shirt. Amelia Broadway stopped her housecleaning and stared at me. \"You don\u0027t look a thing like Hadley,\" she said, and I couldn\u0027t decide by her tone if she thought that was a good thing or a bad thing. \"I\u0027m not at all like Hadley, all the way through,\" I said flatly. \"Well, that\u0027s good. Hadley was pretty awful,\" Amelia said unexpectedly. \"Whoops. Sorry, I\u0027m not tactful.\" \"Really?\" I tried to keep my voice level, but a trace of sarcasm may have leaked through. \"So if you know where the coffee is, can you point me in that direction?\" I was looking at the kitchen area for the first time in the daylight. It had exposed brick and copper, a stainless steel food preparation area and a matching refrigerator, and a sink with a faucet that cost more than my clothes. Small, but fancy, like the rest of the place. All this, for a vampire who didn\u0027t really need a kitchen in the first place. \"Hadley\u0027s coffeepot is right there,\" Amelia said, and I spotted it. It was black and it kind of blended in. Hadley had always been a coffee freak, so I\u0027d figured that even as a vampire she\u0027d kept a supply of her favorite beverage. I opened the cabinet above the pot, and behold - two cans of Community Coffee and some filters. The silvery seal was intact on the first one I opened, but the second can was open and half full. I inhaled the wonderful coffee smell with quiet pleasure. It seemed amazingly fresh. After I fixed the pot and punched a button to set it perking, I found two mugs and set them beside it. The sugar bowl was right by the pot, but when I opened it, I found only a hardened residue. I pitched the contents into the trash can, which was lined but empty. It had been cleaned out after Hadley\u0027s death. Maybe Hadley had had some powdered creamer in the refrigerator? In the South, people who don\u0027t use it constantly often keep it there. But when I opened the gleaming stainless steel refrigerator, I found nothing but five bottles of TrueBlood. Nothing had brought home to me so strongly the fact that my cousin Hadley had died a vamp. I\u0027d never known anyone before and after. It was a shock. I had so many memories of Hadley, some of them happy and some of them unpleasant - but in all of those memories, my cousin was breathing and her heart was beating. I stood with my lips compressed, staring at the red bottles, until I\u0027d recovered enough to shut the door very gently. After a vain search in the cabinets for Cremora, I told Amelia I hoped she took her coffee black. \"Yes, that\u0027ll be fine,\" Amelia said primly. She was obviously trying to be on her better behavior, and I could only be grateful for that. Hadley\u0027s landlady was perched on one of Hadley\u0027s spindle-legged armchairs. The upholstery was really pretty, a yellow silky material printed with dark red and blue flowers, but I disliked the fragile style of the furniture. I like chairs that look as though they could hold big people, heavy people, without a creak or a groan. I like furniture that looks as though it won\u0027t be ruined if you spill a Coke on it, or if your dog hops up on it to take a nap. I tried to settle myself on the loveseat opposite the landlady\u0027s. Pretty, yes. Comfortable, no. Suspicion confirmed. \"So what are you, Amelia?\" \"Beg pardon?\" \"What are you?\" \"Oh, a witch.\" \"Figured.\" I hadn\u0027t caught the sense of the supernatural that I get from creatures whose very cells have been changed by the nature of their being. Amelia had acquired her \"otherness.\" \"Did you do the spells to seal off the apartment?\" \"Yes,\" she said rather proudly. She gave me a look of sheer evaluation. I had known the apartment was warded with spells; I had known she was a member of the other world, the hidden world. I might be a regular human, but I was in the know. I read all these thoughts as easily as if Amelia had spoken them to me. She was an exceptional broadcaster, as clear and clean as her complexion. \"The night Hadley died, the queen\u0027s lawyer phoned me. Of course, I was asleep. He told me to shut this sucker up, that Hadley wouldn\u0027t be coming back, but the queen wanted her place kept intact for her heir. I came up and began cleaning early the next morning.\" She\u0027d worn rubber gloves, too; I could see that in her mental picture of herself the morning after Hadley had died. \"You emptied the trash and made the bed?\" She looked embarrassed. \"Yes, I did. I didn\u0027t realize \u0027intact\u0027 meant \u0027untouched.\u0027 Cataliades got here and let me have it. But I\u0027m glad I got the trash out of here, anyway. It\u0027s strange, because someone went through the garbage bin that night, before I could put it out for pickup.\" \"I don\u0027t guess you know if they took anything?\" She cast me an incredulous look. \"It\u0027s not like I inventory the trash,\" she said. She added, reluctantly, \"It had been treated with a spell, but I don\u0027t know what the spell was for.\" Okay, that wasn\u0027t good news. Amelia wasn\u0027t even admitting it to herself; she didn\u0027t want to think about the house being the target for supernatural assault. Amelia was proud because her wards had held, but she hadn\u0027t thought to ward the garbage bin. \"Oh, I got all her potted plants out and moved them down to my place for easier care, too. So if you want to take \u0027em back to Hole-in-the-Road with you, you\u0027re welcome.\" \"Bon Temps,\" I corrected. Amelia snorted. She had the born city dweller\u0027s contempt for small towns. \"So you own this building, and you rented the upstairs to Hadley when?\" \"About a year ago. She was a vamp already,\" Amelia said. \"And she was the queen\u0027s girlfriend, had been for quite a while. So I figured it was good insurance, you know? No one\u0027s going to attack the queen\u0027s honeybun, right? And no one\u0027s going to break into her place, either.\" I wanted to ask how come Amelia could afford such a nice place herself, but that was just too rude to get past my lips. \"So the witch business supports you?\" I asked instead, trying to sound only mildly interested. She shrugged, but looked pleased I\u0027d asked. Though her mother had left her a lot of money, Amelia was delighted to be self-supporting. I heard it as clearly as if she\u0027d spoken it out loud. \"Yeah, I make a living,\" she said, aiming for a modest tone and just missing. She\u0027d worked hard to become a witch. She was proud of her power. This was just like reading a book. \"If things get slow, I help out a friend who has a magic shop right off Jackson Square. I read fortunes there,\" she admitted. \"And sometimes I do a magic tour of New Orleans for the tourists. That can be fun, and if I scare \u0027em enough, I get big tips. So between one thing and another, I do okay.\" \"You perform serious magic,\" I said, and she nodded happily. \"For who?\" I asked. \"Since the regular world doesn\u0027t admit it\u0027s possible.\" \"The supes pay real well,\" she said, surprised I had to ask. I didn\u0027t really need to, but it was easier to direct her thoughts to the right information if I asked her out loud. \"Vamps and Weres, especially. I mean, they don\u0027t like witches, but vamps especially want every little advantage they can gain. The rest aren\u0027t as organized.\" With a wave of her hand she dismissed the weaker ones of the supernatural world, the werebats and the shape-shifters and so on. She discounted the power of the other supes, which was a mistake. \"What about fairies?\" I asked curiously. \"They have enough of their own magic,\" she said, shrugging. \"They don\u0027t need me. I know someone like you might have a hard time accepting that there\u0027s a talent that\u0027s invisible and natural, one that challenges everything you were taught by your family.\" I stifled a snort of disbelief. She sure didn\u0027t know anything about me. I didn\u0027t know what she and Hadley had talked about, but it hadn\u0027t been Hadley\u0027s family, for sure. When that idea crossed my mind, a bell rang in the back of my head, one that said that avenue of thought should be explored. But I put it aside to think of later. Right now, I needed to deal with Amelia Broadway. \"So you would say you have a strong supernatural ability?\" I said. I could feel her stifle the rush of pride. \"I have some ability,\" she said modestly. \"For example, I laid a stasis spell on this apartment when I couldn\u0027t finish cleaning it. And though it\u0027s been shut up for months, you don\u0027t smell anything, do you?\" That explained the lack of odor wafting from the stained towels. \"And you do witchcraft for supernaturals, you read fortunes off Jackson Square, and you lead tour groups sometimes. Not exactly regular office jobs,\" I said. \"Right.\" She nodded, happy and proud. \"So you make up your own schedule,\" I said. I could hear the relief bouncing through Amelia\u0027s mind, relief that she didn\u0027t have to go into an office any more, though she\u0027d done a stint at the post office for three years until she\u0027d become a full-fledged witch. \"Yes.\" \"So will you help me clean out Hadley\u0027s apartment? I\u0027ll be glad to pay you.\" \"Well, sure I\u0027ll help. The sooner all her stuff is out, the sooner I can rent the place. As for your paying me, why don\u0027t we wait to see how much time I can give it? Sometimes I get, like, emergency calls.\" Amelia smiled at me, a smile suitable for a toothpaste ad. \"Hasn\u0027t the queen been paying the rent since Hadley passed?\" \"Yeah, she has. But it\u0027s given me the creeps, thinking of Hadley\u0027s stuff up here. And there\u0027ve been a couple of break-in attempts. The last one was only a couple of days ago.\" I gave up any pretense of smiling. \"I thought at first,\" Amelia burbled on, \"that it might be like when someone dies and their death notice is in the paper, you get break-ins during the funeral. Course, they don\u0027t print obituaries for vampires, I guess because they\u0027re already dead or because the other vampires just don\u0027t send one to the paper... that would be interesting, to see how they handled it. Why don\u0027t you try sending in a few lines about Hadley? But you know how vamps gossip, so I guess a few people heard she was definitely dead, dead for the second time. Especially after Waldo vanished from the court. Everyone knows he didn\u0027t care for Hadley. And then, too, vamps don\u0027t have funerals. So I guess the break-in wasn\u0027t related. New Orleans does have a pretty high crime rate.\" \"Oh, you knew Waldo,\" I said, to interrupt the flow. Waldo, once the queen\u0027s favorite - not in bed, but as a lackey, I thought - had resented being supplanted by my cousin Hadley. When Hadley remained in favor with the queen for an unprecedented length of time, Waldo lured her to St. Louis Cemetery Number One with the ruse of pretending they were going to raise the spirit of Marie Laveau, the notorious voodoo queen of New Orleans. Instead, he\u0027d killed Hadley and blamed it on the Fellowship of the Sun. Mr. Cataliades had nudged me in the right direction until I\u0027d figured out Waldo\u0027s guilt, and the queen had given me the opportunity to execute Waldo myself - that was the queen\u0027s idea of a big favor. I\u0027d taken a pass on that. But he was finally, definitely dead, now, just like Hadley. I shuddered. \"Well, I know him better than I want to,\" she said, with the frankness that seemed to be Amelia Broadway\u0027s defining characteristic. \"I hear you using the past tense, though. Dare I hope that Waldo has gone to his final destination?\" \"You can,\" I said. \"Dare, that is.\" \"Oo-wee,\" she said happily. \"My, my, my.\" At least I\u0027d brightened someone\u0027s day. I could see in Amelia\u0027s thoughts how much she\u0027d disliked the older vampire, and I didn\u0027t blame her. He\u0027d been loathsome. Amelia was a single-minded kind of woman, which must make her a formidable witch. But right now she should have been thinking about other possibilities involving me, and she wasn\u0027t. There\u0027s a downside to being focused on a goal. \"So you want to clear out Hadley\u0027s apartment because you think your building won\u0027t be targeted any more? By these thieves who\u0027ve learned that Hadley\u0027s dead?\" \"Right,\" she said, taking a final gulp of her coffee. \"I kind of like knowing someone else is here, too. Having the apartment empty just gives me the creeps. At least vampires can\u0027t leave ghosts behind.\" \"I didn\u0027t know that,\" I said. And I\u0027d never thought about it, either. \"No vamp ghosts,\" Amelia said blithely. \"Nary a one. Got to be human to leave a ghost behind. Hey, you want me to do a reading on you? I know, I know, it\u0027s kind of scary, but I promise, I\u0027m good at it!\" She was thinking that it would be fun to give me a touristy-type thrill, since I wouldn\u0027t be in New Orleans long; she also believed that the nicer she was to me, the quicker I\u0027d clean out Hadley\u0027s place so she could have the use of it back. \"Sure,\" I said slowly. \"You can do a reading, right now, if you want.\" This might be a good measure of how gifted a witch Amelia really was. She sure didn\u0027t bear any resemblance to the witch stereotype. Amelia looked scrubbed and glowing and healthy, like a happy suburban housewife with a Ford Explorer and an Irish setter. But quick as a wink, Amelia extricated a Tarot pack from a pocket of her cargo shorts and leaned over the coffee table to deal them out. She did this in a quick and professional way that didn\u0027t make a bit of sense to me. After poring over the pictures for a minute, her gaze stopped roaming over the cards and fixed on the table. Her face reddened, and she closed her eyes as if she were feeling mortified. Of course, she was. \"Okay,\" she said at last, her voice calm and flat. \"What are you?\" \"Telepath.\" \"I\u0027m always making assumptions! Why don\u0027t I learn!\" \"No one thinks of me as scary,\" I said, trying to sound gentle, and she winced. \"Well, I won\u0027t make that mistake again,\" she said. \"You did seem more knowledgeable about supes than the ordinary person.\" \"And learning more every day.\" Even to myself, my voice sounded grim. \"Now I\u0027ll have to tell my advisor that I blew it,\" my landlady said. She looked as gloomy as it was possible for her to look. Not very. \"You have a... mentor?\" \"Yeah, an older witch who kind of monitors our progress the first three years of being a professional.\" \"How do you know when you\u0027re a professional?\" \"Oh, you have to pass the exam,\" Amelia explained, getting to her feet and going over to the sink. In a New York minute, she had washed the coffeepot and the filter apparatus, put them neatly in the drainer, and wiped out the sink. \"So we\u0027ll start packing up stuff tomorrow?\" I said. \"What\u0027s wrong with right now?\" \"I\u0027d like to go through Hadley\u0027s things by myself, first,\" I said, trying not to sound irritated. \"Oh. Well, sure you would.\" She tried to look as if she\u0027d thought of that already. \"And I guess you have to go over to the queen\u0027s tonight, huh?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll bet they\u0027re expecting you. Was there a tall, dark, and handsome vamp out there with you last night? He sure looked familiar.\" \"Bill Compton,\" I said. \"Yes, he\u0027s lived in Louisiana for years and he\u0027s done some work for the queen.\" She looked at me, her clear blue eyes surprised. \"Oh, I thought he knew your cousin.\" \"No,\" I said. \"Thanks for getting me up so I could start work, and thanks for being willing to help me.\" She was pleased that she was leaving, because I hadn\u0027t been what she\u0027d expected, and she wanted to think about me some and make some phone calls to sisters in the craft in the Bon Temps area. \"Holly Cleary,\" I said. \"She\u0027s the one I know best.\" Amelia gasped and said a shaky good-bye. She left as unexpectedly as she\u0027d arrived. I felt old all of a sudden. I\u0027d just been showing off, and I\u0027d reduced a confident, happy young witch to an anxious woman in the space of an hour. But as I got out a pad and pencil - right where they should be, in the drawer closest to the telephone - to figure out my plan of action, I consoled myself with the thought that Amelia had needed the mental slap in the face pretty badly. If it hadn\u0027t come from me, it might have come from someone who actually meant her harm.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-14.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.
