{"id":101267,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Once he knew what he was doing, Quinn was relentless. Since we couldn\u0027t be any more miserable than we already were, he decided we might as well be moving. While I did little more than follow him and stay out of his way, he began to scour the area for smells. Finally he got tired of crouching, and he said, \"I\u0027m going to change.\" He stripped quickly and efficiently, rolling the clothes into a compact (but sopping) bundle and handing them to me to carry. Every conjecture I\u0027d had about Quinn\u0027s body was absolutely on target, I was pleased to note. He\u0027d begun taking off his clothes without a single hesitation, but once he noticed I was looking, he held still and let me look. Even in the dark, dripping rain, he was worth it. Quinn\u0027s body was a work of art, though a scarred work of art. He was one large block of muscle, from his calves to his neck.\n \"Do you like what you see?\" he asked.\n \"Oh, boy,\" I said. \"You look better than a Happy Meal to a three-year-old.\"\n Quinn gave me a broad, pleased smile. He bent to crouch on the ground. I knew what was coming. The air around Quinn began to shimmer and tremble, and then within that envelope Quinn began to change. Muscles rippled and flowed and reformed, bones reshaped, fur rolled out of somewhere inside him - though I knew that couldn\u0027t be, that was the illusion. The sound was dreadful. It was a kind of gloppy, sticky sound, but with hard notes in it, as if someone were stirring a pot of stiff glue that was full of sticks and rocks.\n At the end of it, the tiger stood across from me.\n If Quinn had been a gorgeous naked man, he was an equally beautiful tiger. His fur was a deep orange slashed with black stripes, and there were touches of white on his belly and face. His eyes slanted, and they were golden. He was maybe seven feet long and at least three feet tall at the shoulder. I was amazed at how big he was. His paws were fully developed and as big as some dinner plates. His rounded ears were just plain cute. He walked over to me silently, with a grace unusual in such a massive form. He rubbed his huge head against me, almost knocking me down, and he purred. He sounded like a happy Geiger counter.\n His dense fur was oily to the touch, so I figured he was pretty well waterproofed. He gave a barking cough, and the swamp went silent. You wouldn\u0027t think Louisiana wildlife would recognize the sound of a tiger, right? But it did, and it shut its mouth and hid.\n We don\u0027t have the same special space requirements with animals that we do with people. I knelt beside the tiger that had been Quinn, in some magical way was still Quinn, and I put my arms around his neck, and I hugged him. It was a little disturbing that he smelled so much like an actual tiger, and I forced my mind around the fact that he was a tiger, that Quinn was inside him. And we set out through the swamp.\n It was a little startling to see the tiger mark his new territory - this is not something you expect to see your boyfriend do - but I decided it would just be ridiculous to mind the display. Besides, I had enough to think about, keeping up with the tiger. He was searching for scents, and we covered a lot of ground. I was growing more and more exhausted. My sense of wonder faded, and I was simply wet and chilly, hungry and grumpy. If someone had been thinking right under my feet, I\u0027m not sure my mind would have picked the thoughts up.\n Then the tiger froze, nose testing the air. His head moved, ears twitching, to search in a particular direction. He turned to look at me. Though tigers can\u0027t smile, I got the definite wave of triumph from the huge cat. The tiger turned his head back to the east, rotated his massive head to look at me, and turned his head to the east again. Follow me, clear as a bell.\n \"Okay,\" I said, and put my hand on his shoulder.\n Off we went. The trip through the swamp lasted an eternity, though later I estimated that \"eternity,\" in this case, was probably about thirty minutes. Gradually the ground grew firmer, the water scarcer. Now we were in forest, not swamp.\n I\u0027d figured we\u0027d gotten close to our abductors\u0027 destination when the van had turned off onto the side road. I\u0027d been right. When we came to the edge of the clearing surrounding the little house, we were to the west side of the north-facing house. We could see both front and back yards. The van that had held us captive was parked in the back. In the tiny clearing at the front was a car, some kind of GMC sedan.\n The little house itself was like a million other houses in rural America. It was a box of a place: wooden, painted tan, with green shutters on the windows and green uprights to support the roof over the tiny front porch. The two men from the van, Clete and George, were huddled on the concrete square because of that bit of shelter, however inadequate it was.\n The matching structure at the rear of the house was a little deck outside the back door, scarcely large enough to hold a gas grill and a mop. It was open to the elements. By the way, the elements were really going to town.\n I stowed Quinn\u0027s clothes and shoes at the foot of a mimosa tree. The tiger\u0027s lips pulled back when he scented Clete. The long teeth were as frightening as a shark\u0027s.\n The afternoon of rain had lowered the temperature. George and Clete were shivering in the damp cool of the evening. They were both smoking. The two Weres, in human form and smoking, would not have a better sense of smell than regular people. They showed no sign of being aware of Quinn at all. I figured they would react pretty dramatically if they caught the scent of tiger in southern Louisiana.\n I worked my way through the trees around the clearing until I was very close to the van. I eased my way around it and crept up to the passenger side. The van was unlocked, and I could see the stun gun. That was my goal. I took a deep breath and opened the door, hoping the light that came on wasn\u0027t interesting to anyone who could see out the back window. I grabbed the stun gun from the jumble of stuff between the front seats. I shut the door as quietly as a van door can be shut. Luckily, the rain seemed to muffle the noise. I gave a shaky sigh of relief when nothing happened. Then I duckwalked back into the edge of the woods and knelt by Quinn.\n He licked my cheek. I appreciated the affection in the gesture, if not the tiger breath, and I scratched his head.\n (Somehow, kissing his fur had no appeal.) That done, I pointed to the left west window, which should belong to a living room. Quinn didn\u0027t nod or give me a high five, both of which would have been untigerlike gestures, but I guess I had expected him to give me some kind of green light. He just looked at me.\n Picking up my feet carefully, I stepped out into the little open space between the forest and the house, and very carefully I made my way to the lit window.\n I didn\u0027t want to pop into view like a jack-in-the-box, so I hugged the side of the house and inched sideways until I could peer in at the very corner of the glass. The older Pelts, Barbara and Gordon, were sitting on an \"early American\" loveseat dating from the sixties, and their body language clearly proclaimed their unhappiness. Their daughter Sandra paced back and forth in front of them, though there wasn\u0027t much room for such an exhibition. It was a very small family room, a room that would be comfortable only if you had a family of one. The older Pelts looked as if they were going to a Lands\u0027 End photo shoot, while Sandra was more adventurously clad in skintight stretch khakis and a bright striped short-sleeved sweater. Sandra was dressed for trolling for cute guys at the mall, rather than torturing a couple of people. But torturing was what she\u0027d been planning to do. There was a straight-backed chair crammed into the room, too, and it had straps and handcuffs already attached.\n On a familiar note, there was a roll of duct tape sitting ready beside it.\n I\u0027d been pretty calm until I saw the duct tape.\n I didn\u0027t know if tigers could count, but I held up three fingers in case Quinn was watching. Moving slowly and carefully, I squatted down and moved south until I was below the second window. I was feeling pretty proud of my sneaking ability, which should have alerted me to potential disaster. Pride goeth before a fall.\n Though the window was dark, when I eased up into position, I was looking through the glass right into the eyes of a small swarthy man with a mustache and goatee. He was sitting at a table right by the window, and he\u0027d been holding a cup of coffee in his hand. In his shock, he let it drop to the table and the hot backsplash hit his hands and chest and chin.\n He shrieked, though I wasn\u0027t sure he was using actual words. I heard a commotion at the front door and in the front room.\n Well... eff.\n I was around the corner of the house and up the steps to the little deck faster than you could say Jack Robinson. I yanked open the screen door and pushed in the wooden door, and I leaped into the kitchen with the stun gun on. The small guy was still patting at his face with a towel while I zapped him, and he went down like a sack of bricks. Wow!\n But the stun gun had to recharge, I discovered, when Sandra Pelt, who\u0027d had the advantage of already being on her feet, charged into the kitchen, teeth bared. The stun gun didn\u0027t do a damn thing to her, and she was on me like an - well, like an enraged wolf.\n However, she was still in the form of a girl, and I was desperate and desperately angry.\n I\u0027ve seen at least two dozen bar fights, ranging from halfhearted punches to rolling-on-the-ground biting, and I know how to fight. Right now I was willing to do whatever it took. Sandra was mean, but she was lighter and less experienced, and after some wrestling and punching and hair pulling that went by in a flash, I was on top of her and had her pinned to the floor. She snarled and snapped but she couldn\u0027t reach my neck, and I was prepared to head-butt her if I had to.\n A voice in the background bellowed, \"Let me in!\" and I assumed it was Quinn behind some door. \"Come on now!\" I yelled in answer. \"I need help!\"\n She was squirming underneath me, and I dared not let go to shift my grip. \"Listen, Sandra,\" I panted, \"hold still, dammit!\"\n \"Fuck you,\" she said bitterly, and her efforts redoubled.\n \"This is actually kind of exciting,\" a familiar voice said, and I glanced up to see Eric looking down at us with wide blue eyes. He looked immaculate: neat as a pin in blue jeans that had a crease and a starched blue-and-white striped dress shirt. His blond hair was shining clean and (here was the most enviable part) dry. I hated his guts. I felt nasty to the nth degree.\n \"I could use some help here,\" I snapped, and he said, \"Of course, Sookie, though I\u0027m enjoying the wiggling around. Let go of the girl and stand up.\"\n \"Only if you\u0027re ready for action,\" I said, my breathing ragged with the effort of holding Sandra down.\n \"I\u0027m always ready for action,\" Eric said, with a glowing smile. \"Sandra, look at me.\"\n She was too smart for that. Sandra squeezed her eyes shut and fought even harder. In a second, she freed one of her arms and swung it back to get momentum for her punch. But Eric dropped to his knees and caught the hand before it could fly at my head.\n \"That\u0027s enough,\" he said in an entirely different tone, and her eyes flew open in surprise. Though he still couldn\u0027t catch her with his eyes, I figured he had charge of her now. I rolled off the Were to lie on my back in what remained of the floor in the tiny kitchen. Mr. Small and Dark (and Burned and Stunned), who I figured owned this house, was crumpled by the table.\n Eric, who was having almost as much trouble with Sandra as I\u0027d had, took up a lot more of the available space. Exasperated with the Were, he adopted a simple solution. He squeezed the fist he\u0027d caught, and she screamed. And shut up - and quit struggling.\n \"That\u0027s just not fair,\" I said, fighting a wave of weariness and pain.\n \"All\u0027s fair,\" he said quietly.\n I didn\u0027t like the sound of that. \"What are you talking about?\" I asked. He shook his head. I tried again. \"Where\u0027s Quinn?\"\n \"The tiger has taken care of your two abductors,\" Eric said, with an unpleasant smile. \"Would you like to go see?\"\n \"Not particularly,\" I said, and closed my eyes again. \"I guess they\u0027re dead?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they wish they were,\" Eric said. \"What did you do to the little man on the floor?\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t believe me if I told you,\" I said.\n \"Try me.\"\n \"I scared him so bad he spilled hot coffee on himself. Then I hit him with a stun gun that I got out of the van.\"\n \"Oh.\" There was a kind of breathy sound, and I opened my eyes to see that Eric was laughing silently.\n \"The Pelts?\" I asked.\n \"Rasul has them covered,\" Eric said. \"You have another fan, it seems.\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s because of the fairy blood,\" I said irritably. \"You know, it\u0027s not fair. Human guys don\u0027t like me. I know about two hundred of \u0027em who wouldn\u0027t want to date me if I came with a Chevy truck. But because supes are attracted to the fairy smell, I get accused of being a guy magnet. How wrong is that?\"\n \"You have fairy blood,\" Eric said, as if his own lightbulb had just lit up. \"That explains a lot.\"\n That hurt my feelings. \"Oh no, you couldn\u0027t just like me,\" I said, tired and hurting beyond coherence. \"Oh no, gosh, there has to be a reason. And it\u0027s not gonna be my sparkling personality, oh no! It\u0027s gonna be my blood, because it\u0027s special. Not me, I\u0027m not special...\"\n And I would have gone on and on, if Quinn hadn\u0027t said, \"I don\u0027t give a damn about fairies, myself.\" Any available room left in the kitchen vanished.\n I scrambled to my feet. \"You okay?\" I asked in a wobbly voice.\n \"Yes,\" he said, in his deepest rumble. He was altogether human again, and altogether naked. I would\u0027ve hugged him, but I felt a little embarrassed about embracing him in the altogether, in front of Eric.\n \"I left your clothes out there in the woods,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll go get \u0027em.\"\n \"I can.\"\n \"No, I know where they are, and I couldn\u0027t get any wetter.\" Besides, I\u0027m not sophisticated enough to be comfortable in a room with a naked guy, an unconscious guy, a real horrible girl, and another guy who\u0027s been my lover.\n \"Fuck you, bitch,\" the charming Sandra called after me, and shrieked again, as Eric made it clear he didn\u0027t care for name calling.\n \"Right back at you,\" I muttered, and trudged out into the rain.\n Oh, yes, it was still raining.\n I was still brooding over the fairy-blood thing as I scooped up the bundle of Quinn\u0027s sodden clothes. It would be easy to slide into a depressed trough if I thought the only reason anybody ever liked me was because I had fairy blood. Of course, there was always the odd vampire who had been ordered to seduce me... I was sure the fairy blood had just been a bonus, in that case... no, no, no, wasn\u0027t going there.\n If I looked at it in a reasonable way, the blood was just as much a part of me as my eye color or the thickness of my hair. It hadn\u0027t done a thing for my half-fairy grandmother, assuming the gene had come to me through her and not one of my other grandparents. She\u0027d married a human man who hadn\u0027t treated her any differently than he would have if her blood had been plain old grade A human. And she\u0027d been killed by a human who hadn\u0027t known anything about her blood other than the color of it. Following the same assumption, fairy blood hadn\u0027t made a bit of difference to my father. He\u0027d never in his life encountered a vampire who might be interested in him because of it - or if he had, he\u0027d kept it mighty close. That didn\u0027t seem likely. And the fairy blood hadn\u0027t saved my father from the flash flood that had washed my parents\u0027 truck off the bridge and into the swollen stream. If the blood had come to me through my mother, well, she\u0027d died in the truck, too. And Linda, my mother\u0027s sister, had died of cancer in her midforties, no matter what kind of heritage she had.\n I didn\u0027t believe this wonderful fairy blood had done all that much for me, either. Maybe a few vampires had been a little more interested in me and friendly to me than they would have been otherwise, but I couldn\u0027t say that had been much of an advantage.\n In fact, many people would say the vampire attention had been a big negative factor in my life. I might be one of those people. Especially since I was standing out here in the pouring rain holding someone else\u0027s wet clothes and wondering what the hell to do with them.\n Having come full circle, I slogged back to the house. I could hear a lot of moaning coming from the front yard: Clete and George, presumably. I should have gone to check, but I couldn\u0027t muster up the energy.\n Back in the kitchen, the small dark man was stirring a little, his eyes opening and shutting and his mouth twitching. His hands were tied behind him. Sandra was bound with duct tape, which cheered me up quite a bit. It seemed a neat piece of poetic justice. She even had a neat rectangle squarely over her mouth, which I presumed was Eric\u0027s work. Quinn had found a towel to secure around his waist, so he looked very... preppy.\n \"Thanks, babe,\" he said. He took his clothes and began squeezing them out over the sink. I dripped on the floor. \"I wonder if there\u0027s a dryer?\" he asked, and I opened another door to find a little pantry/utility room with shelves on one wall and on the other a water heater and a tiny washer and dryer.\n \"Pass \u0027em in here,\" I called, and Quinn came in with his clothes. \"Yours need to go in there, too, babe,\" he said, and I noticed he sounded as tired as I felt. Changing into and out of tiger form without the full moon, in such a short space of time, must have been very difficult. \"Maybe you can find me a towel?\" I asked, pulling off the wet pants with great effort. Without a single joke or leer, he went to see what he could find. He returned with some clothes, I assumed from the small man\u0027s bedroom: a T-shirt, shorts, socks. \"This is the best I could do,\" he said.\n \"It\u0027s better than I hoped for,\" I said. After I\u0027d used the towel and I had pulled on the clean, dry clothes, I almost wept with gratitude. I gave Quinn a hug and then went to find out what we were going to do with our hostages.\n The Pelts were sitting on the floor, securely handcuffed, in the living room, watched by Rasul. Barbara and Gordon had looked so mild when they\u0027d come to Merlotte\u0027s to meet with me in Sam\u0027s office. They looked mild no longer. Rage and malice sat oddly on their suburban faces.\n Eric brought Sandra in, too, and dumped her by her parents. Eric stood in one doorway, Quinn in another (which a glance told me led into Small and Dark\u0027s bedroom). Rasul, gun in hand, relaxed his vigilance a little now that he had such formidable backup. \"Where\u0027s the little guy?\" he asked. \"Sookie, I\u0027m glad to see you looking so well, even though your ensemble falls below your usual standards.\"\n The shorts were baggy cargo shorts, the shirt was big, and the white socks were the capper. \"You really know how to make a girl feel beautiful, Rasul,\" I said, scraping together maybe half a smile to offer him. I sat down in the straight-backed chair and I asked Barbara Pelt, \"What were you going to do with me?\"\n \"Work on you until you told us the truth, and Sandra was satisfied,\" she said. \"Our family couldn\u0027t be at peace until we knew the truth. And the truth lies in you, I just know it.\"\n I was troubled. Well, beyond troubled. Because I didn\u0027t know what to say to her just yet, I looked from Eric to Rasul. \"Just the two of you?\" I asked.\n \"Any time two vampires can\u0027t handle a handful of Weres is the day I become human again,\" Rasul said, with an expression so snooty I was tempted to laugh. But he\u0027d been exactly right (though of course he\u0027d had a tiger who helped). Quinn was propped in the doorway looking picturesque, though just at the moment his great expanse of smooth skin didn\u0027t interest me at all.\n \"Eric,\" I said, \"what should I do?\"\n I don\u0027t think I\u0027d ever asked Eric for advice before. He was surprised. But the secret wasn\u0027t only mine.\n After a moment, he nodded.\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what happened to Debbie,\" I said to the Pelts. I didn\u0027t ask Rasul and Quinn to leave the room. I was getting rid of this right now, both the lingering guilt and the hold Eric had on me.\n I\u0027d thought about that evening so often that my words came automatically. I didn\u0027t cry, because all my tears had been shed months ago, in private.\n Once I\u0027d finished the story, the Pelts sat and stared at me, and I stared back.\n \"That sounds like our Debbie,\" said Barbara Pelt. \"This has the ring of truth.\"\n \"She did have a gun,\" said Gordon Pelt. \"I gave it to her for Christmas two years ago.\" The two Weres looked at each other.\n \"She was... proactive,\" Barbara said, after a moment. She turned to Sandra. \"Remember when we had to go to court, when she was in high school, because she put super-glue in that cheerleader\u0027s hairbrush? The one that was dating her ex-boyfriend? That does sound like Debbie, huh?\"\n Sandra nodded, but the duct tape wouldn\u0027t permit her speech. Sandra had tears rolling down her cheeks.\n \"You still don\u0027t remember where you put her?\" Gordon asked Eric.\n \"I would tell you if I did,\" Eric said. Not that I care, his tone implied.\n \"You guys hired the two kids who attacked us in Shreveport,\" Quinn said.\n \"Sandra did,\" Gordon admitted. \"We didn\u0027t know about it until Sandra had already bitten them. She\u0027d promised them...\" He shook his head. \"She\u0027d sent them to Shreveport on her errand, but they would have returned home to collect their reward. Our Jackson pack would have killed them. Mississippi doesn\u0027t permit bitten Weres. They kill them on sight. The boys would have named Sandra as their maker. The pack would have abjured her. Barbara\u0027s dabbled with witchcraft, but nothing of the level that would have sealed the boys\u0027 mouths. We hired an out-of-state Were to track them when we found out. He couldn\u0027t stop them, couldn\u0027t prevent their arrest, so he had to be arrested and go into the jail system with them, to take care of the problem.\" He looked up at us, shook his head sternly. \"He bribed Cal Myers to put him in the cell with them. Of course, we punished Sandra for that.\"\n \"Oh, did you take away her cell phone for a week?\" If I sounded sarcastic, I thought I had a right to be. Even cooperative, the Pelts were pretty horrible. \"We were both hurt,\" I said, nodding toward Quinn, \"and those two kids are dead now. Because of Sandra.\"\n \"She\u0027s our daughter,\" Barbara said. \"And she believed she was avenging her murdered sister.\"\n \"And then you hired all the Weres that were in the second van, and the two Weres lying out in the front yard. Are they going to die, Quinn?\"\n \"If the Pelts don\u0027t take them to a Were doctor, they may. And they sure can\u0027t go to any human hospital.\"\n Quinn\u0027s claws would have left distinctive marks.\n \"Will you do that?\" I asked skeptically. \"Take Clete and George to a Were doctor?\"\n The Pelts looked at each other and shrugged. \"We figured you were going to kill us,\" Gordon said. \"Are you going to let us walk away? With what assurances?\"\n I\u0027d never met anyone quite like the Pelts before, and it was easier and easier to see where Debbie had gotten her charming personality, adopted or not.\n \"With assurances that I never hear of this again,\" I said. \"Neither I nor Eric.\"\n Quinn and Rasul had been listening silently.\n \"Sookie is a friend of the Shreveport pack,\" Quinn said. \"They are very upset she was attacked, in their own city, and now we know you\u0027re responsible for that attack.\"\n \"We heard she was no favorite of the new packleader.\" Barbara\u0027s voice held a trace of contempt. She was reverting to her own personality, since she no longer feared her own death. I liked them better when they were scared.\n \"He may not be packleader for long,\" Quinn said, his voice a quiet threat. \"Even if he stays in office, he can\u0027t rescind the pack\u0027s protection, since it was guaranteed by the previous packleader. The honor of the pack would be destroyed.\"\n \"We\u0027ll make reparations to the Shreveport pack,\" Gordon said wearily.\n \"Did you send Tanya to Bon Temps?\" I asked.\n Barbara looked proud of herself. \"Yes, I did that. You know our Debbie was adopted? She was a werefox.\"\n I nodded. Eric looked quizzical; I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d met Tanya.\n \"Tanya is a member of Debbie\u0027s birth family, and she wanted to do something to help. She thought if she went to Bon Temps and began working with you, you might let something spill. She said you were too suspicious to warm up to her offer of friendship. I think she might stay in Bon Temps. I understand finding the bar owner so attractive was an unexpected bonus.\"\n It was kind of gratifying to discover Tanya was as untrustworthy as I\u0027d suspected. I wondered if I had the right to tell Sam this whole story, by way of warning. I\u0027d have to think about that later.\n \"And the man who owns this house?\" I could hear him groaning and moaning from the kitchen.\n \"He\u0027s a former high school buddy of Debbie\u0027s,\" Gordon said. \"We asked him if we could borrow his house for the afternoon. And we paid him. He won\u0027t talk after we leave.\"\n \"What about Gladiola?\" I asked. I remembered the two burning body sections on my driveway. I remembered Mr. Cataliades\u0027s face, and Diantha\u0027s grief.\n They all three stared at me blankly. \"Gladiola? The flower?\" Barbara said, looking genuinely puzzled. \"It\u0027s not even the right season for glads, now.\"\n That was a dead end.\n \"Do you agree we\u0027re square on this?\" I asked baldly. \"I\u0027ve hurt you, you\u0027ve hurt me. Even?\"\n Sandra shook her head from side to side, but her parents ignored her. Thank God for duct tape. Gordon and Barbara nodded at each other.\n Gordon said, \"You killed Debbie, but we do believe that you killed her in self-defense. And our living daughter took extreme and unlawful methods to attack you... It goes against my grain to say this, but I think we have to agree to leave you alone, after this day.\"\n Sandra made a lot of weird noises.\n \"With these stipulations.\" Gordon\u0027s face suddenly looked hard as a rock. The yuppie man took a backseat to the Were. \"You won\u0027t come after Sandra. And you stay out of Mississippi.\"\n \"Done,\" I said instantly. \"Can you control Sandra enough to make her keep to this agreement?\" It was a rude but valid question. Sandra had enough balls for an army, and I doubted very much if the Pelts had ever really had control over either of their daughters.\n \"Sandra,\" Gordon said to his daughter. Her eyes blazed at him from her forcibly mute face. \"Sandra, this is law. We are giving our word to this woman, and our word is binding on you. If you defy me, I\u0027ll challenge you at the next full moon. I\u0027ll take you down in front of the pack.\"\n Both mother and daughter looked shocked, Sandra more so than her mother. Sandra\u0027s eyes narrowed, and after a long moment, she nodded.\n I hoped Gordon lived a long time and enjoyed good health while he lived. If he grew ill, or if he died, Sandra wouldn\u0027t feel bound by this agreement, I felt pretty darn sure. But as I walked out of the little house in the swamp, I thought I had a reasonable chance of not seeing the Pelts again in my life, and that was absolutely okay with me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-21.html","bookId":2196,"book":{"id":2196,"title":"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6) \n As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.

The range of suspects runs from the Rogue Weres who reject Sookie as a friend of the Pack to the Vampire Queen herself, who could be working through a particularly vulnerable subject—Sookie’s first love, Bill. \n Whoever it is, they’re definitely dangerous—and Sookie’s life is definitely on the line… \n With HBO\u0027s launching of an all-new show, True Blood, based on the Southern Vampire novels, the demand for Charlaine Harris and Sookie Stackhouse is bigger than ever.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:28 PM"}}
