{"id":101269,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"What was the deal with Jade Flower?\" Amelia asked the next day. Everett was driving the U-Haul, and Amelia and I were following in her little car. Quinn had left the next morning by the time I\u0027d gotten up, leaving me a note telling me he was going to call me after he\u0027d hired someone to take Jake Purifoy\u0027s place and after his next job, which was in Huntsville, Alabama - a Rite of Ascension, he said, though I had no idea what that was. He ended the note with a very personal comment about the lime-green dress, which I won\u0027t repeat here. Amelia had her bags packed by the time I\u0027d dressed, and Everett was directing two husky men in loading up the boxes I wanted to take back to Bon Temps. When he returned, he would take the furniture I didn\u0027t want to Goodwill. I\u0027d offered it to him, but he\u0027d looked at the fake antiques and politely said they weren\u0027t his style. I\u0027d tossed my own stuff in Amelia\u0027s trunk, and off we\u0027d driven. Bob the cat was in his own cage on the backseat. It was lined with towels and also held a food and water bowl, which was kind of messy. Bob\u0027s litter box was on the floorboard. \"My mentor found out what I\u0027d done,\" Amelia said gloomily. \"She\u0027s very, very unhappy with me.\" I wasn\u0027t surprised, but it didn\u0027t seem tactful to say so, when Amelia had been such a help to me. \"He is missing his life now,\" I pointed out, as mildly as I could manage. \"Well, true, but he\u0027s having a hell of an experience,\" Amelia said, in the voice of someone determined to look on the bright side. \"I\u0027ll make it up to him. Somehow.\" I wasn\u0027t sure this was something you could \"make up\" to someone. \"I\u0027ll bet you can get him back to himself soon,\" I said, trying to sound confident. \"There are some really nice witches in Shreveport who might help.\" If Amelia could conquer her prejudice against Wiccans. \"Great,\" the witch said, looking more cheerful. \"In the meantime, what the hell happened last night? Tell me in detail.\" I figured it was all over the supernatural community today, so I might as well spill the beans. I told Amelia the whole story. \"So how did Cataliades know Jade Flower had killed Gladiola?\" Amelia asked. \"Um, I told him,\" I said, my voice small. \"How\u0027d you know?\" \"When the Pelts told me they hadn\u0027t hired anyone to watch the house, I figured the murderer was someone sent by Peter Threadgill to delay my getting the message from Cataliades. Peter Threadgill knew all along that the queen had lost the bracelet to Hadley. Maybe he had spies among the queen\u0027s own people, or maybe one of her dumber followers, like Wybert, let it slip. It wouldn\u0027t be hard to watch the movements of the two goblin girls the queen used as messengers. When one of them came to deliver the queen\u0027s message to me, Jade Flower followed her and killed her. The wound was pretty drastic, and after I saw Jade Flower\u0027s sword and watched her whip it out so fast I couldn\u0027t see it move, I figured she was a likely candidate for the designated killer. Plus, the queen had said if Andre was in New Orleans, everyone had to assume she was, too... so the reverse had to be true, right? If the king was in New Orleans, everyone would assume Jade Flower was, too. But she was outside my house, in the woods.\" I shuddered all over at the memory. \"I found out for sure after calling a lot of gas stations. I talked to a guy who definitely remembered Jade Flower.\" \"So why did Hadley steal the bracelet?\" \"Jealousy, I guess, and the desire to put the queen in a bad spot. I don\u0027t think Hadley understood the implications of what she\u0027d done, and by the time she did, it was too late. The king had laid his plans. Jade Flower watched Hadley for a while, snatched the opportunity to take Jake Purifoy and kill him. They hoped it would be blamed on Hadley. Anything that would discredit Hadley would discredit the queen. They had no way of knowing she would turn him.\" \"What will happen to Jake now?\" Amelia looked troubled. \"I liked him. He was a nice guy.\" \"He still may be. He\u0027s just a vampire nice guy.\" \"I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s such a thing,\" my companion said quietly. \"Some days, I\u0027m not sure either.\" We rode for a while in silence. \"Well, tell me about Bon Temps,\" Amelia said, to get us out of our conversational doldrums. I began to tell her about the town, and the bar where I worked, and the wedding shower I\u0027d been invited to attend, and all the upcoming weddings. \"Sounds pretty good,\" Amelia said. \"Hey, I know I kind of asked myself along. Do you mind, I mean, really?\" \"No,\" I said, with a speed that surprised even me. \"No, it\u0027ll be nice to have company... for a while,\" I added cautiously. \"What will you do about your house in New Orleans while you\u0027re gone?\" \"Everett said he wouldn\u0027t mind living in the upper apartment, because his mom was getting kind of hard to take. Since he\u0027s got such a good job with Cataliades, he can afford it. He\u0027ll watch my plants and stuff until I get back. He can always e-mail me.\" Amelia had a laptop in her trunk, so for the first time there\u0027d be a computer in the Stackhouse home. There was a pause, and then she said, her voice tentative, \"How are you feeling now? I mean, with the ex and all?\" I considered. \"I have a big hole in my heart,\" I said. \"But it\u0027ll close over.\" \"I don\u0027t want to sound all Dr. Phil,\" she said. \"But don\u0027t let the scab seal the pain in, okay?\" \"That\u0027s good advice,\" I said. \"I hope I can manage it.\" I\u0027d been gone a few days, and they\u0027d been eventful ones. As we drew closer to Bon Temps, I wondered if Tanya had succeeded in getting Sam to ask her out. I wondered if I\u0027d have to tell Sam about Tanya\u0027s role as spy. Eric didn\u0027t have to be confused about me any more, since our big secret was out. He didn\u0027t have a hold on me. Would the Pelts stick to their word? Maybe Bill would go on a long trip. Maybe a stake would accidentally fall on his chest while he was gone. I hadn\u0027t heard from Jason while I was in New Orleans. I wondered if he was still planning on getting married. I hoped Crystal had recovered. I wondered if Dr. Ludwig accepted insurance payments. And the Bellefleur double wedding should be an interesting event, even if I was working while I was there. I took a deep breath. My life was not so bad, I told myself, and I began to believe that was true. I had a new boyfriend, maybe; I had a new friend, surely; and I had events to look forward to. This was all good, and I should be grateful. So what if I was obliged to attend a vampire conference as part of the queen\u0027s entourage? Wed stay in a fancy hotel, dress up a lot, attend long boring meetings, if everything other people had told me about conferences was true. Gosh, how bad could that be? Better not to think about it. Dear Readers, If you\u0027ve enjoyed Sookie\u0027s adventures, you might be interested in reading other works of mine. In 2005, Berkley published Grave Sight, the first book in a series about a young woman named Harper Connelly. Harper was struck by lightning when she was fifteen years old, and since then she\u0027s been able to find dead people. Now in her twenties, Harper and her stepbrother, Tolliver, conduct their unique business on the road. As the two travel from job to job, they encounter all kinds of clients along the way. Sometimes, the body Harper finds has met a foul death... and sometimes, the people who pay her think Harper knows more than she does about who committed the murder. If you think you might like reading about Harper and Tolliver, Grave Surprise, the second book about their investigations, will be on the shelves in hardcover in November of 2006. The same month, Grave Sight will be released in paperback. I hope you enjoy the change of pace.
