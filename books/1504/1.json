[2] This person’s surname “Lan” is the same character as the character for the color blue. [3] Throughout this story I will consistently translate the Chinese character 刀 as “blade.” This character encompasses all kinds of blades, from butchers knives, to swords. I will only translate the character 剑 as “sword.” [4] Handan is a city in China\u0027s modern-day Hebei Province in the north, not too far from Beijing Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heros-shed-no-tears/hsnt-chapter-0","bookId":1504,"book":{"id":1504,"title":"Heroes Shed No Tears","description":"Gao Jianfei: A naive martial arts genius, exploring the martial arts world for the first time in his life.
