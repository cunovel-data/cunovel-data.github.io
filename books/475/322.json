{"id":15279,"no":322,"title":"November 18","content":"“Blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me”(Luke7:23)\n It is sometimes very difficult not to be offended in Jesus Christ. \n The offenses may be circumstantial. I find myself in a prison-house━a narrow sphere, a sick chamber, an unpopular position━when I had hoped for wide opportunities. Yes, but He knows what is best for me. My environment is of His determining. He means it to intensify my faith, to draw me into nearer communion with Himself, to ripen my power. In the dungeon my soul should prosper.\n The offense may be mental. I am haunted by perplexities, questions, which I cannot solve. I had hoped that, when I gave myself to Him, my sky would always be clear; but often it is overspread by mist and cloud. Yet let me believe that, if difficulties remain, it is that I may learn to trust Him all the more implicitly━to trust and not be afraid. Yes, and by my intellectual conflicts, I am trained to be a tutor to other storm-driven men.\n The offense may be spiritual. I had fancied that within His fold I should never feel the biting winds of temptation; but it is best as it is. His grace is magnified. My own character is matured. His Heaven is sweeter at the close of the day. There I shall look back on the turnings and trials of the way, and shall sing the praises of my Guide. So, let come what will come, His will is welcome; and I shall refuse to be offended in my loving Lord.━Alexander Smellie \n Blessed is he whose faith is not offended,\n When all around his way\n The power of God is working out deliverance\n For others day by day;\n Though in some prison drear has own soul languish,\n Till life itself be spent,\n Yet still can trust his Father\u0027s love and purpose,\n And rest therein content.\n Blessed is he, who through long years of suffering,\n Cut off from active toil,\n Still shares by prayer and praise the work of others,\n And thus “divides the spoil.”\n Blessed are thou, 0 child of God, who sufferest,\n And canst not understand\n The reason for thy pain, yet gladly leavest\n Thy life in His blest Hand.\n Yea, blessed art thou whose faith is \"not offended\"\n By trials unexplained,\n By mysteries unsolved, past understanding,\n Until the goal is gained.\n ━Freda Hanbury Allen \n 十一月十八日\n 「凡不因我跌倒的，就有福了。」 （路七:23）\n 有时候，「不因主跌倒」，的确是一件很难做到的事情。\n 叫我们跌倒的也许是环境方面的事情━当我们渴望为主作工的时候，却被囚在一个极狭窄的地方、一间病室里、一个不顺遂的地位上。但是，无论如何，主知道我们的需要。我们所在的环境，都是主亲手替我们安排的。祂放我们在现在的地位上，是要加增我们的信心，牵引我们更近主。 \n 叫我们跌倒的也许是思想方面的事情━思想一直萦绕着许多我们所不能解决的疑问、难题。我们原希望：当我们把自己交给主的时候，天色就会变蓝的；可是交托了以后，天空仍满布着烟雾、黑云。让我们在这里相信：如果我们把自己交给主以后，困难仍在的话，这定规是因为主要我们学习更深信祂的缘故。 \n 叫我跌倒的也许是属灵方面的事情━我们曾以为在主的怀抱中，不再受到试探的狂风了；可是，不料试探的狂风却比以前来得更猛。试探越加猛，主的恩典越加大。我们如果回过头去看看我们一路所遭遇的试炼，我们就会大声歌咏赞美我们的向导了。所以，不论前面将遭遇的是甚么，只要是主的旨意，我们都该欢迎。但愿我们不再因我们的爱主跌倒！━司买莉\n 神在他周围救赎别人,\n 发挥着无穷的大力；\n 他虽轮不到,仍能不违信心,\n 他就有了福泽；\n 他的灵魂虽在幽禁中凋萎,\n 直到生命结朿,\n 他仍能信靠天父的爱和目的,\n 而得安息满足。\n 种人是有福的;经过长期痛苦,\n 隔离了实际的活动与服务,\n 仍以祈祷和赞美分担别人工作,\n 他也必分享到应有的酬报。\n 神的子女,你是有福的,\n 你虽不懂你受苦的去迹来踪,\n 你接受了最大的苦难,\n 仍乐意把生命交在祂手中。\n 始终不违信心的,就有福了,\n 经过不能说明的试炼,\n 经过无法解答和领会的谜团,\n 直到目标的实现。\n 一艾伦\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5557.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
