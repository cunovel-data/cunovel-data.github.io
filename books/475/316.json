{"id":15273,"no":316,"title":"November 12","content":"“These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work” (1 Chron. 4:23) Anywhere and everywhere we may dwell \"with the king for his work.\" We may be in a very unlikely and unfavorable place for this; it may be in a literal country life, with little enough to be seen of the \"goings\" of the King around us; it may be among the hedges of all sorts, hindrances in all directions; it may be furthermore, with our hands full of all manner of pottery for our daily task. No matter! The King who placed us \"there\" will come and dwell there with us; the hedges are right, or He would soon do away with them. And it does not follow that what seems to hinder our way may not be for its very protection; and as for the pottery, why, that is just exactly what He has seen fit to put into our hands, and therefore it is, for the present, \"His work.\"━Frances Ridley Havergal “Go back to thy garden-plot,sweetheart ! Go back till the the evening falls, And bind thy lilies and train thy vines, Till for thee the Master calls.” “Go make thy garden fair as thou canst, Thou workest never alone; Perhaps he whose plot is next to thine, Will see it and mend his own.” The colored sunsets and starry heavens, the beautiful mountains and the shining seas, the fragrant woods and painted flowers, are not half so beautiful as a soul that is serving Jesus out of love, in the wear and tear of common, unpoetic life.━Faber The most saintly spirits are often existing in those who have never distinguished themselves as authors, or left any memorial of themselves to be the theme of the world\u0027s talk; but who have led an interior angelic life, having borne their sweet blossoms unseen like the young lily in a sequestered vale on the bank of a limpid stream. ━Kenelm Digby 十一月十二日 「这些人都是窑匠，是住在田园和篱笆中间的，在那里他们与王同处，为王作工。」 (代上四:23，直译） 无论在甚么地方，我们都有「与王同处，为王作工」的可能。也许是在一个非常不顺遂的地方；也许是在一个粗俗的乡野，一个看不见有王与我们同处的地方；也许是在各种篱笆中间，障碍下面，也许我们的手还须拿着各种陶器，天天过着窑匠的生活。不论在甚么地方，那安放我们「在那里」的王，必来与我们同处；如果祂以为篱笆是不需要的话，祂必定会立刻把它们拆去的。或许那似乎妨碍我们的，倒成了我们的保护呢！至于那放在我们手中的陶器，正是王看为最适于我们「为王作工」的。━海弗格尔 亲爱的,回到你的园地, 回去,直到夜幕深垂, 去收拾水仙,修理葡萄, 直到主把你唤归。 回去尽力整好你的园地, 作工的决不会只有你一人, 也许和你相邻的那位园丁, 看见之后,也会仿效你的辛勤。 彩色的落日、嵌星的天空、美丽的高山、明净的洋海、芳香的树木、鲜艳的花草━它们虽然美丽，还及不到一个在普通生活上用爱心、眼泪事奉主的信徒一半美丽。━费勃尔 最圣洁的灵魂,往往在于那些声名不显赫的人物身上,他们圣洁的内在生活,像清澈的池塘隐僻之处,藏着一枝看不见的娇嫩莲花。━迪比","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5551.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
