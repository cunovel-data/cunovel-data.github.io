{"id":15091,"no":134,"title":"May 14","content":"\"In the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\" (Gen. 17:23)\n Instant obedience is the only kind of obedience there is; delayed obedience is disobedience. Every time God calls us to any duty, He is offering to make a covenant with us; doing the duty is our part, and He will do His part in special blessing.\n The only way we can obey is to obey \"in the selfsame day,\" as Abraham did. To be sure, we often postpone a duty and then later on do it as fully as we can. It is better to do this than not to do it at all. But it is then, at the best, only a crippled, disfigured, half-way sort of duty-doing; and a postponed duty never can bring the full blessing that God intended, and that it would have brought if done at the earliest possible moment.\n It is a pity to rob ourselves, along with robbing God and others, by procrastination. \"In the selfsame day\" is the Genesis way of saying, \"Do it now.\" --Messages for the Morning Watch.\n Luther says that \"a true believer will crucify the question, \u0027Why?\u0027 He will obey without questioning.\" I will not be one of those who, except they see signs and wonders, will in no wise believe. I will obey without questioning.\n \"Ours not to make reply,\n Ours not to reason why,\n Ours but to do and die.\"\n Obedience is the fruit of faith; patience, the bloom on the fruit. --Christina Rossetti.\n 　 五月十四日\n “正当那日……遵着神的命”（创十七：23）。\n 　　立刻的顺服是唯一的顺服；延宕的顺服是不顺服。每次神给我们一个命令，他同时给我们一个应许；顺服他的命令是我们的事，成就他的应许是他的事。\n 　　不顺服则已，要顺服就当在“正当那日”，象亚伯拉罕一样。可是我们常先要看神的命令是否容易，是否合乎自己的喜好，是否合乎群众的心理…考虑再叁，然后再顺服。我们以为这样比不顺服总好。但是，你要知道，延宕的顺服决不能叫你得到神所预备给你的完全的祝福。若要不折不扣得到他所应许的福祉，除非立刻顺服。\n 　　延宕是剥夺了自己从神那里赐下的机会，经文说：“正当那日”，换一句话说，就是立刻去做。\n 　　马丁路得说：一个真肯顺服的信徒已经把他的“为什么”钉死了。他的顺服是无疑问的顺服。看见了迹象才信的人不是最智慧的人，我要不问原由而服从。\n 我们不问原由，\n 也不作答案的寻求，\n 立刻去执行，至死不休。\n 　　顺服是信心的果子，忍耐是果子的彩色。——罗赛弟\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5123.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
