{"id":15112,"no":155,"title":"June 4","content":"\"The Lord caused the sea to go back…alll that night.\" (Exod. 14:21) In this verse there is a comforting message showing how God works in the dark. The real work of God for the children of Israel, was not when they awakened and found that they could get over the Red Sea; but it was \"all that night.\" So there may be a great working in your life when it all seems dark and you cannot see or trace, but yet God is working. Just as truly did He work \"all that night,\" as all the next day. The next day simply manifested what God had done during the night. Is there anyone reading these lines who may have gotten to a place where it seems dark? You believe to see, but you are not seeing. In your life-progress there is not constant victory; the daily, undisturbed communion is not there, and all seems dark. \"The Lord caused the sea to go back…all that night.\" Do not forget that it was \"all that night.\" God works all the night, until the light comes. You may not see it, but all that \"night\" in your life, as you believe God, He works. --C. H. P. \"All that night\" the Lord was working, Working in the tempest blast, Working with the swelling current, Flooding, flowing, free and fast. \"All that night\" God\u0027s children waited-- Hearts, perhaps in agony-- With the enemy behind them, And, in front, the cruel sea. \"All that night\" seemed blacker darkness Than they ever saw before, Though the light of God\u0027s own presence Near them was, and sheltered o\u0027er. \"All that night\" that weary vigil Passed; the day at last did break, And they saw that God was working \"All that night\" a path to make. \"All that night,\" O child of sorrow, Canst thou not thy heartbreak stay? Know thy God in darkest midnight Works, as well as in the day. --L. S. P. 　 六月四日 “耶和华…使海水一夜退去”（出十四：21）。 　　在这节圣经中有一个宝贵的信息，就是神在黑暗中工作。神当初为他的选民以色列人所行的神迹，并非在白昼，乃是在黑夜——在看不见，摸不到，觉不得的时候。 　　照样也许你的生活，在你的黑暗中，虽然你看不见什么，可是神正在工作。等天一亮，你就会象当初的以色列人一般，看见水已退去，有一条干路，在顶危险的环境中，要带你平安过去。 　　亲爱的读者，有没有人正处在似若黑暗的环境中？你相信能够看见，但此时看不见。你生命的长进，不会永远顺利；此时已失去了往常的和谐，似乎一切都黑暗无光。 　　“耶和华……使海水一夜退去。”要记住“一夜”两个字。神整夜作工，直到天亮。你也许看不见，但由于你信神，他在你生命中的这“一夜”，正在工作。 那一夜，神整夜作工， 工作在暴风雨吹打之中， 其时海水高涨， 浪潮汹涌，狂流激冲。 那一夜，神的子民在等待， 他们心中痛苦和愤慨， 后面有敌人在追赶， 前面却是茫茫的大海。 那一夜，无比的黑暗， 为他们前所未见， 虽然神的光明就在旁， 冥冥之中保护他们。 那一夜，焦急又疲困， 但终于过去，到了天光破晓， 他们看见神的大作为， 一夜之间已把拯救之路铺好。 那一夜，哀恸的子民， 你岂不应当停止伤心， 要知道神的工作在最黑的夜， 正如白天一样的辛劳。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5158.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
