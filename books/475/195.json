Shall we not ask to be bound to it, the we may never be able to start back from our attitude of consecration? There are times when life is full of roseate light, and we choose the Cross; at other times, when the sky is grey, we shrink from it. It is well to be bound. \\n\\n Wilt Thou bind us, most blessed Spirit, and enamor us with the Cross, and let us never leave it? Bind us with the scarlet cord of redemption, and the golden cord of love, and the silver cord of Advent-hope, so we will not go back from it, or wish for another lot than to be the humble partners with our Lord in His pain and sorrow! \\n\\n The horns of the altar invite thee. Wilt thou come ? Wilt thou dwell ever in a spirit of resigned humility, and give thyself wholly to the Lord? \\n\\n --- Selected. \\n\\n The story is told of a colored brother who, at a camp meeting, tried to give himself to God. Every night at the altar he consecrated himself; but every night before he left the meeting, the devil would come to him and convince him that he did not feel any different and therefore he was not consecrated. \\n\\n Again and again he was beaten back by the adversary. Finally, one evening he came to the meeting with an axe and a big stake. After consecrating himself, he drove the stake into the ground just where he had knelt. As he was leaving the building, the devil came to him as usual and tried to make him believe that it was all a farce. \\n\\n At once he went back to the stake and, pointing to it, said, \"Look here, Mr. Devil, do you see the stake? Well, that\u0027s my witness that God has forever accepted me.\" Immediately the devil left him, and he had no further doubts on the subject.─The Still Small Voice. \\n\\n Beloved, if you are tempted to doubt the finality of your consecration, drive a stake down somewhere and let it be your witness before God and even the devil that you have settled the question forever. \\n\\n Are you groping for a blessing,\\n\\n Never getting there?\\n\\n Listen to a word in season,\\n\\n Get somewhere.\\n\\n Are you struggling for salvation,\\n\\n By your anxious prayer?\\n\\n Stop your struggling, simply trust, and-\\n\\n Get somewhere.\\n\\n Does the answer seem to linger,\\n\\n To your earnest prayer?\\n\\n Turn your praying into praise, and-\\n\\n Get somewhere.\\n\\n You will never know His fullness,\\n\\n Till you boldly dare\\n\\n To commit your all to Him, and-\\n\\n Get somewhere.\\n\\n ─Songs of the Spirit.　\\n\\n 七月十四日 \\n\\n 「用绳索把祭牲拴住，牵到坛角那里。（诗篇一一八:27）\\n\\n 　　读者阿，祭坛不是在呼召我们吗？我们不是要请求绳索把我们拴在祭坛上，使我们永远不把我们的奉献拿回来吗？我们常常在生活充满了玫瑰色光彩的时候，乐意选择十字架；在天色灰暗的时候，就退缩了。所以如果能用绳索把我们拴住的话，多么好呢！ \\n\\n 　　圣灵阿，求你把我们拴住，拴在十字架上，让我们永远不会离开它。求你用救恩的红绳、爱的金绳、望的银绳、把我们拴住，叫不能逃回旧日的宽路去，也叫我们不去羡慕别的命运━只羡慕作主痛苦悲伤中卑贱的伴侣！ \\n\\n 　　读者阿，坛角在呼召你了。你愿不愿意来呢？你愿不愿意永远居在顺从谦卑的灵中，把你自己完全奉献给主呢？──选 \\n\\n 　　在一次野外聚会里，有一位弟兄，愿意把自己奉献给神。他每天晚上在祭坛旁边奉献自己；但是每天晚上在他离开聚会以前，魔鬼就来使他相信：他并没有感觉什么分别，一定是神没有接受他的奉献。 \\n\\n 　　一次一次他这样被仇敌击退，最后一天晚上，他来赴会的时候，带了一把斧头和一根长大的木椿来。他把自己奉献了以后，就将木椿钉入他所跪的那块地上。当他走出会场的时候，魔鬼又来引诱他相信这一切都不过是一幕闹剧而已。 \\n\\n 　　他立刻回到木椿那里，指着木椿说：「你看，魔鬼先生，你看见那根木椿吗？那就是我的证人━ 证明神已经永远接受了我。」魔鬼立即离开了他， 这位弟兄对于这个问题，以后再没有什么疑惑了。 ── 微小的声音\\n\\n 　　亲爱的，如果你也受了引诱疑惑你的奉献的话，你也可以在一个地方钉下一根木椿，让它在神前、魔鬼前，做一个证人说，你已经永远解决了这个问题。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5265.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
