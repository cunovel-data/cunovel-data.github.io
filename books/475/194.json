{"id":15151,"no":194,"title":"July 13","content":"\"God...calleth those things which be not as though they were.\" (Rom. 4:17.)\n WHAT does that mean? Why Abraham did this thing: he dared to believe God.It seemed an impossibility at his age that Abraham should become the father of a child; it looked incredible; and yet God called him a \"father of many nations\" before there was a sign of a child; and so Abraham called himself \"father\" because God called him so. That is faith; it is to believe and assert what God says. \"Faith steps on seeming void, and finds the rock beneath.\" \n Only say you have what God says you have, and He will make good to you all you believe. Only it must be real faith, all there is in you must go over in that act of faith to God. --- Crumbs. \n Be willing to live by believing and neither think nor desire to live in any other way. Be willing to see every outward light extinguished, to see the eclipse of every star in the blue heavens, leaving nothing but darkness and perils around, if God will only leave in thy soul the inner radiance, the pure bright lamp which faith has kindled. --- Thomas C. Upham. \n The moment has come when you must get off the perch of distrust, out of the nest of seeming safety, and onto the wings of faith; just such a time as comes to the bird when it must begin to try the air. It may seem as though you must drop to the earth; so it may seem to the fledgling. It, too, may feel very like falling; but it does not fall-it\u0027s pinions give it support, or, if they fail, the parent birds sweeps under and bears it upon its wings. \n Even so will God bear you. Only trust Him; \"thou shalt be holden up.\"(Rom14:4) \"Well, but\" you say, \"am I to cast myself upon nothing?\" That is what the bird seems to have to do; but we know the air is there, and the air is not so unsubstantial as it seems. And you know the promises of God are there, and they are not unsubstantial at all. \"But it seems an unlikely thing to come about that my poor weak soul should be girded with such strength.\" Has God said it shall? \"That my tempted, yielding nature shall be victor in the strife.\" Has God said it shall? \"That my timorous, trembling heart shall find peace?\" \n Has God said it shall? for, if He has, you surely do not mean to give Him the lie! Hath he spoken, and shall He not do it? If you have gotten a word- \"a sure word\" of promise-take it implicitly, trust it absolutely. And this sure word you have; nay, you have more-you have Him who speaks the word confidently. \"Yea, I say unto you,\" trust Him. --- J. B. Figges, M. A. 　\n 七月十三日 \n 「亚伯拉罕所信的，是那叫死人复活，使无变为有的神，祂在主面前作我们世人的父。如经上所记，我已经立你作多国的父。」（罗4:17）\n 　　亚伯拉罕为甚么这样信靠神？照世人的眼光看来，亚伯拉罕到了这么大的年龄，是不能再有作父亲的希望了；但是神却在他还没有一些生子的兆头以先，就叫他「多国的父」了；神既这样说，亚伯拉罕就这样信。这就是信心；信心就是相信拥护神所说的。信心举步的时候，彷佛前面全是空虚；但是脚一踏上去，就立即发见底下有一块稳固的盘石了。 \n 神说你有甚么，你就信你有甚么；这样，神必将你所信的给你。── 碎锦\n 　　你应当甘心乐意地过着信心的生活，不要羡慕别的。虽然你看见你外面的灯光都熄灭了，天上的星光也蒙蔽了，四围剩下的只是黑暗和危险， 但是你还该欢喜快乐，因为知道神在你内心仍给你留下属灵的灿烂━信心点燃的明灯。── 阿伯汉\n 　　时候已经到了，你不该再栖息怀疑的木竿上了，走出你自以为安全的巢窝来，披上信心的翅翼罢；小鸟儿必须出来学习飞了。学习的时候， 牠深怕自己会跌下去，可是事实上并没有跌━牠的翅膀支住了牠。 \n 　　读者啊！只要信靠神，「你必要站住」（罗马书 14 章 4 节）。你也许要说：「我这样软弱的人，未必会得着能力罢！」神说：「你会」。你也许要说：「我这易受诱惑、易于降服的天性，未必会得着胜利吧！」神说：「你会」。你也许要说：「我这怯懦震颤的心魂，未必会得着安宁罢！」神说：「你会」。 \n 　　神既这样说过，你当然不能以神为说谎的！祂说过了，难道会不去作吗？所以如果你已经得到了神一句话━一个确实的允许━你就当丝毫不疑完完全全地信任祂，因为你不只有一句确实的话，你也有一位说这话的信实的主。── 费极斯\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5264.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
