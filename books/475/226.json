{"id":15183,"no":226,"title":"August 14","content":"\"Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above\" (John 19:11). \n Nothing that is not God\u0027s will can come into the life of one who trusts and obeys God. This fact is enough to make our life one of ceaseless thanksgiving and joy. For \"God\u0027s will is the one hopeful, glad, and glorious thing in the world\"; and it is working in the omnipotence for us all the time, with nothing to prevent it if we are surrendered and believing. \n One who was passing through deep waters of affliction wrote to a friend: \"Is it not a glorious thing to know that, no difference how unjust a thing may be, or how absolutely it may seem to be from Satan, by the time it reaches us it is God\u0027s will for us, and will work for good to us? For all things work together for good to us who love God. And even of the betrayal, Christ said, \"The cup which my Father gave me, shall I not drink it?\"(John18:123) We live charmed lives if we are living in the center of God\u0027s will. All the attacks that Satan, through others\u0027 sin, can hurl against us are not only powerless to harm us, but are turned into blessings on the way.--H. W. S.\n In the center of the circle\n Of the Will of God I stand:\n There can come no second causes,\n All must come from His dear hand.\n All is well! for \u0027tis my Father\n Who my life hath planned.\n Shall I pass through waves of sorrow?\n Then I know it will be best;\n Though / cannot tell the reason,\n I can trust, and so am blest.\n God is Love, and God is faithful,\n So in perfect Peace I rest.\n With the shade and with the sunshine,\n With the joy and with the pain,\n Lord, / trust Thee! both are needed,\n Each Thy wayward child to train,\n Earthly loss, did tor but know it,\n Often means our heavenly gain.\n - I.G.W.　\n 八月十四日\n 「若不是从上头赐给你的，你就毫无权柄办我。」（约十九11） \n 凡是临到一个信靠顺服神的人身上的事情，没有一件不是神的旨意。这就足够叫我们不息地感谢赞美了。因为神的旨意，是世上最有希望的、最快活的、最荣耀的东西；祂也是全能的；只要我们肯顺服信靠，没有东西能阻止祂。 \n 一个深受痛苦的人写信给他的朋友说：「不管这件事多么不公正，多么像出乎撒但，但我一想到这事临到我，是神的旨意，并且是叫我得益处的，我就立刻觉得荣耀了。」感谢神，我们晓得万事都互相効力，叫爱神的人得益处。就是被卖这一件事，基督尚且说：「我父所给我的那杯，我岂可不喝呢？」（约十八13）如果我们生活在神的旨意中，我们的生活是何等佳美？撒但给我们的一切袭击，不但无力伤害我们，并且在半路上都已经变成祝福了。──H.
