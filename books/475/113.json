{"id":15070,"no":113,"title":"April 23","content":"\"Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me.\" (Psalm 138:7) The Hebrew rendering of the above is \"go on in the center of trouble.\" What descriptive words! We have called on God in the day of trouble; we have pleaded His promise of deliverance but no deliverance has been given; the enemy has continued oppressing until we were in the very thick of the fight, in the center of trouble. Why then trouble the Master any further? When Martha said, \"Lord, if thou hadst been here my brother had not died,\" our Lord met her lack of hope with His further promise, \"Thy brother shall rise again.\" And when we walk \"in the center of trouble\" and are tempted to think like Martha that the time of deliverance is past, He meets us too with a promise from His Word. \"Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me.\" Though His answer has so long delayed, though we may still continue to \"go on\" in the midst of trouble, \"the center of trouble\" is the place where He revives, not the place where He fails us. When in the hopeless place, the continued hopeless place, is the very time when He will stretch forth His hand against the wrath of our enemies and perfect that which concerneth us, the very time when He will make the attack to cease and fail and come to an end. What occasion is there then for fainting? --Aphra White. THE EYE OF THE STORM \"Fear not that the whirlwind shall carry thee hence, Nor wait for its onslaught in breathless suspense, Nor shrink from the whips of the terrible hail, But pass through the edge to the heart of the gale, For there is a shelter, sunlighted and warm, And Faith sees her God through the eye of the storm. \"The passionate tempest with rush and wild roar And threatenings of evil may beat on the shore, The waves may be mountains, the fields battle plains, And the earth be immersed in a deluge of rains, Yet, the soul, stayed on God, may sing bravely its psalm, For the heart of the storm is the center of calm. \"Let hope be not quenched in the blackness of night, Though the cyclone awhile may have blotted the light, For behind the great darkness the stars ever shine, And the light of God\u0027s heavens, His love shall make thine, Let no gloom dim thine eyes, but uplift them on high To the face of thy God and the blue of His sky. \"The storm is thy shelter from danger and sin, And God Himself takes thee for safety within; The tempest with Him passeth into deep calm, And the roar of the winds is the sound of a psalm. Be glad and serene when the tempest clouds form; God smiles on His child in the eye of the storm.\" 　 　 四月二十三日 “我虽行在患难中，你必将我救活”（诗一百三十八；7）。 　　希伯来原文的直译是“我虽行在患难的中心，你必将我救活。”许多时候，我们在患难中求告神；我们恳请他实行他拯救的应许，可是拯救仍不来到；原来他要等到我们被仇敌逼到患难的中心，然后伸手施行拯救。所以，目前何必急于烦劳他呢？ 　　马大对主说：“主啊，你若早在这里，我兄弟必不死”（约十一：21）；我们的主答应她的绝望说：“你兄弟必然复活。”（约十一：23）当我们到了患难的中心，我们也会像马大一般想拯救的时候过去了，但是主坚固我们说：“我虽行在患难中，你必将我救活”。 　　虽然他的答应延搁了许久，虽然我们还须在患难中继续受逼迫，但是患难的中心是他施行拯救的地方，不是他误事的地方。到了那时，他要伸出他的手来对付仇敌的忿怒，停止一切的攻击。信徒们，为什么这样绝望呢？——华爱德 不要怕飓风把你卷离此地， 也不要屏息等它的攻击， 也不要畏缩于冰雹的暴戾， 却要从风暴的边缘进入它中间， 那飓风眼，有阳光温暖和遮蔽。 信心从飓风眼里去见神。 狂啸怒吼奔腾而来的大风浪， 这凶恶的威胁可能以你为目标， 海中波涛如山，陆上田野成战场， 地土几乎沉没于大雨洪流中， 信靠神的人，却仍把诗篇高唱， 因为暴风雨的中心是安宁的地方。 风暴可能暂时遮掩光明， 但不要在黑暗中丧失希望， 因为星星永远在黑暗的后面照耀， 神的大爱，使你获得天上的光芒， 不要让阴暗蒙蔽你的眼睛， 要仰望神的圣容和蓝色的天堂。 风雨是阻挡危险与罪恶的遮荫， 神将亲自带你进去获得安宁， 浪随着他会化为平静， 风的怒号变成赞美的歌声， 当阴云密布时，要安详而欢欣， 神的微笑在暴风雨中心降临。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5049.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
