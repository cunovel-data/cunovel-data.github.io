{"id":15288,"no":331,"title":"November 27","content":"\"For with God nothing shall be impossible\" (Luke 1:37)\\n\\n Far up in the Alpine hollows, year by year God works one of His marvels. The snow-patches lie there, frozen with ice at their edge from the strife of sunny days and frosty nights; and through that ice-crust come, unscathed, flowers that bloom.\\n\\n Back in the days of the by-gone summer, the little soldanelle plant spread its leaves wide and flat on the ground, to drink in the sun-rays, and it kept them stored in the root through the winter. Then spring came, and stirred the pulses even below the snow-shroud, and as it sprouted, warmth was given out in such strange measure that it thawed a little dome in the snow above its head.\\n\\n Higher and higher it grew and always above it rose the bell of air, till the flower-bud formed safely within it: and at last the icy covering of the air-bell gave way and let the blossom through into the sunshine, the crystalline texture of its mauve petals sparkling like snow itself as if it bore the traces of the flight through which it had come.\\n\\n And the fragile thing rings an echo in our hearts that none of the jewel-like flowers nestled in the warm turf on the slopes below could waken. We love to see the impossible done. And so does God.\\n\\n Face it out to the end, cast away every shadow of hope on the human side as an absolute hindrance to the Divine, heap up all the difficulties together recklessly, and pile as many more on as you can find; you cannot get beyond the blessed climax of impossibility. Let faith swing out to Him. He is the God of the impossible. ━Selected \\n\\n 十一月二十七日 \\n\\n 「因为出于神话，没有一句不带能力的。」（路一:37）\\n\\n 在阿尔卑斯山的顶巅，神年年创造祂的奇迹，山上覆盖着厚雪，被白天的阳光和寒夜的严霜交相作用之下，积雪的边缘结成了冰，可是在这一层冰壳之下，却有花朵，正在完整无恙在开放出来。 \\n\\n 这种花属樱花科，只长在高山之上，在夏季里，它舒展叶子，平躺在地，畅饮阳光，吸收了大自然阳光的热量，能贮藏在根里过冬。然后春天来了，一切植物都在苏醒过来，积雪下的生命也不例外，这种樱草科发出了芽，它放出暖气，那奇妙的热度，恰好把顶上的积雪溶成一钟形的小汽罩。 \\n\\n 它继续长高，头上总是戴着那个钟形的小汽罩，直到里面长好了花苞。最后，钟形小汽罩的外壳脱落，花就直接与阳光接触，紫红色的花瓣，莹净剔透，络脉有似雪花，好像还保留着它生长斗争中所历经的痕迹。 \\n\\n 这种织柔的植物，它在我们心中所引起的反响，决非那些长在山坡下面，从温暖泥土中孕育的花卉所能比拟。我们喜欢不可能的事，成为事实，神亦如此。 \\n\\n 对不可能的事，要坚持到底，把所有的困难，毫无顾忌地堆在一起，并且把你所能找到的更多困难加上去，让信心倾向祂，祂是对付一切不可能的神。━选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5566.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
