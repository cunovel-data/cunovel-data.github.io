When we wait on God, He is waiting till we are ready; when we wait for God, we are waiting till He is ready.\\n\\n There are some people who say, and many more who believe, that as soon as we meet all the conditions, God will answer our prayers. They say that God lives in an eternal now; with Him there is no past nor future; and that if we could fulfill all that He requires in the way of obedience to His will, immediately our needs would be supplied, our desires fulfilled, our prayers answered. \\n\\n There is much truth in this belief, and yet it expresses only one side of the truth. While God lives in an eternal now, yet He works out His purposes in time. A petition presented before God is like a seed dropped in the ground. Forces above and beyond our control must work upon it, till the true fruition of the answer is given.--The Still Small Voice\\n\\n I longed to walk along an easy road,\\n\\n And leave behind the dull routine of home,\\n\\n Thinking in other fields to serve my God;\\n\\n But Jesus said, My time has not yet come.”\\n\\n I longed to sow the seed in other soil,\\n\\n To be unfettered in the work, and free,\\n\\n To join with other laborers in their toil;\\n\\n But Jesus said, “Tis not My choice for thee.”\\n\\n I longed to leave the desert, and be led\\n\\n To work where souls were sunk in sin and shame,\\n\\n That I might win them; but the Master said,\\n\\n \"I have not called thee, publish here My name. \"\\n\\n I longed to fight the battles of my King,\\n\\n Lift high His standards in the thickest strife;\\n\\n But my great Captain bade me wait and sing\\n\\n Songs of His conquests in my quiet life.\\n\\n I longed to leave the uncongenial sphere,\\n\\n Where all alone I seemed to stand and wait,\\n\\n To feel I had some human helper near,\\n\\n But Jesus bade me guard one lonely gate.\\n\\n I longed to leave the round of daily toil,\\n\\n Where no one seemed to understand or care;\\n\\n But Jesus said, “I choose for thee this soil,\\n\\n That thou might \u0027st raise for Me some blossoms rare.”\\n\\n And now I have no longing but to do\\n\\n At home, or else afar, His blessed will,\\n\\n To work amid the many or the few;\\n\\n Thus, \"choosing not to choose, II my heart is still.\\n\\n -Selected\\n\\n \"And Patience was willing to wait. \"-Pilgrim\u0027s Progress\\n\\n 九月五日\\n\\n 「凡等候祂的，都是有福的。」（赛卅18）\\n\\n 关于等候神的眞理，我们已经听得很多了\\n\\n 有些人说━也有许多人相信━我们一履行了所有的条件，神就要立即答应我们的祷告。他们说：神永远是现在的神；在神没有过去，也没有将来；如果我们能够顺服祂的旨意，实行祂的命令，立刻我们的需要可以得到供给，我们的欲望可以得到满足，我们的祷告可以得到答应。 \\n\\n 这种信仰也有许多眞理，但是可惜只表达了眞理的一面。神永远是现在的神，这句话一点都不错；但是神行事是有祂的「时候」的。一个呈在神前的请求，好像一粒在地里的种子。上面的力，必须多方栽培，答应纔会得到眞实的实现。－－译自微小的声音\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5396.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
