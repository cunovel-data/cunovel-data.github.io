{"id":15057,"no":100,"title":"April 10","content":"\"Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.\" (Job 10:2)\n Perhaps, O tried soul, the Lord is doing this to develop thy graces. There are some of thy graces which would never have been discovered if it were not for the trials. Dost thou not know that thy faith never looks so grand in summer weather as it does in winter? Love is too oft like a glowworm, showing but little light except it be in the midst of surrounding darkness. Hope itself is like a star--not to be seen in the sunshine of prosperity, and only to be discovered in the night of adversity. Afflictions are often the black folds in which God doth set the jewels of His children\u0027s graces, to make them shine the better.\n It was but a little while ago that, on thy knees, thou wast saying, \"Lord, I fear I have no faith: let me know that I have faith.\"\n Was not this really, though perhaps unconsciously, praying for trials?--for how canst thou know that thou hast faith until thy faith is exercised? Depend upon it. God often sends us trials that our graces may be discovered, and that we may be certified of their existence. Besides, it is not merely discovery; real growth in grace is the result of sanctified trials.\n God trains His soldiers, not in tents of ease and luxury, but by turning them out and using them to forced marches and hard service. He makes them ford through streams, and swim through rivers and climb mountains, and walk many a weary mile with heavy knapsacks on their backs. Well, Christian, may not this account for the troubles through which you are passing? Is not this the reason why He is contending with you? --C. H. Spurgeon.\n To be left unmolested by Satan is no evidence of blessing.\n 　 四月十日\n “要指示我，你为何与我争辩”（伯十：2）。\n 　　哦，受试炼的人们，神正在训练你们诸般的德行。有许多德行，必须在试炼中，才会彰显。你的信心在得意中不及在失意中表现得伟大。爱心好象萤火虫一般，非在黑暗的环境中，发不出明亮的光来。盼望好象星一般——在顺利的日光下是看不见什么的，惟在黑暗的夜间会照出美丽的光彩来。所有的苦难都是宝石匣内所衬的云绒，为要叫宝石——我们的德行——显得更美丽的。\n 　　你不是刚跪着祷告说，“主啊，我怕我没有信心；让我知道我有没有信心”吗？你这样祷告，岂不是不知不觉地在求试炼吗？——因为你的信心不受试炼，你怎么能知道你有没有信心呢？神给我们试炼，常是为着要彰显我们的德行，让我们可以知道我们到底有没有这些德行。并且，试炼不只叫我们的德行彰显，也叫我们的德行长进。\n 　　神训练他的兵士，不能在安适奢华的宫中训练他们，必须在野地的营中训练他们，他必须打发他们出去实习——兼程进兵，劳力服役。有时叫他们攀山，有时叫他们涉水，有时叫他们游泳，有时叫他们背着重负行军。基督徒啊，这是神的方法，难道你还抱怨么？——司布真\n 　　不被撒但打扰，并不是得福的证据。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5036.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
