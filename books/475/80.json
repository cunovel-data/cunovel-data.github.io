God would have us believe His Word without other confirmation, and then He is ready to give us \"according to our faith.\" \n \n \"When once His Word is past, \n \n When He hath said , \u0027I will,\u0027 (Heb. 13:5) \n \n The thing shall come at last; \n \n God keeps His promise still.\" (2 Cor. 1:20) \n \n The prayer of the Pentecostal age was like a cheque to be paid in coin over the counter. --Sir R. Anderson. \n \n \"And God said…and it was so.\" (Gen. 1:9) 　 　 \n \n 三月二十一日 \n \n “照着你们的信给你们成全了罢”(太九：29) 。 \n \n 　　“祷告透切”的意思就是祷告到完全的信心里去；祷告到还在祷告的时候就已经有了一种把握：觉得我们的祷告已蒙垂听，已蒙悦纳了；祷告到事情还没有实现之先，已经得着了所求的。 \n \n 　　让我们记得世上任何环境，都不能拦阻神的话应验，所以让我们坚信他的话没有改变的可能，虽然世界一直在改变。神要我们单信他的话，不用别的证实，或凭据，然后他要照着我们的信给我们成全。 \n \n 　　事情终会实现, \n \n 　　 他有过应许在先； \n \n 　　他说:“不撇下你”，(来十三：5) \n \n 　　 神永远信守诺言。(林后一：20) \n \n 　　古代信徒的祷告，像放在银行柜台上的支票一样，立刻可以兑取现金。——安德生 \n \n 　　“神说…事就这样成了”(创一：9) 。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5016.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
