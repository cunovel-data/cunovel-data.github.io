I said: \"But the air is thick, And fogs are veiling the sun\"; He answered: \"Yet souls are sick, And souls in the dark undone. \" I said: \"I shall miss the light, And friends will miss me, they say\"; He answered me, \"Choose tonight, If I am to miss you, or they. \" I pleaded for time to be given; He said: \"Is it hard to decide? It will not seem hard in Heaven To have followed the steps of your Guide. \" I cast one look at the fields, Then set my face to the town; He said: \"My child, do you yield? Will you leave the flowers for the crown?\" Then into His hand went mine, And into my heart came He; And I walk in a light Divine, The path I had feared to see. ━George MacDonald 十二月五日 「耶和华阿，我晓得人的道路不由自己。行路的人，也不能定自己的脚步。」 （耶十:23） 「求祢……引导我走平坦的路。」（诗廿七:11） 许多人非但不听从神的指导，反要指导神；非但不跟神走，反要神跟他走。━盖恩夫人 我说:「让我走向野外」， 神说: 「不，你要领略城市的壮观」， 我说:「那里没有花」， 祂说: 「没有花，却有一顶王冠」。 我说:「可是天空乌黑, 只有喧哗与污浊。」; 而祂含泪看着我, 说道:「还有罪恶。」 我说:「可是天气阴霾, 浓雾遮掩了阳光。」; 祂答道:「正因为人们有病, 黑暗中盼望医疗之方。」 我说:「我将失去光明, 朋友也将失去我这个伴侣。」; 祂回答说:「今夜就选择, 失去他们,还是与我共处。」 我恳求祂给我考虑的时间, 祂说:「这有甚么难于决定? 在天堂的观点看来, 只要跟随你向导者的足印。」 我回头向野外看了一眼, 然后转脸对着城市。 祂说:「你愿意了吗? 为王冠而放弃花儿呢?」 然后我让祂握住我的手, 祂进入我的心灵； 在神圣的光照下, 走向了先前所害怕的路径。 ━麦克唐纳","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5574.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
