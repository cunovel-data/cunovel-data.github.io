Richard Baxter said, \"O God, I thank Thee for a bodily discipline of eight and fifty years\"; and he is not the only man who has turned a trouble into triumph. \n This school of our Heavenly Father will soon close for us; the term time is shortening every day. Let us not shrink from a hard lesson or wince under any rod of chastisement. The richer will be the crown, and the sweeter will be Heaven, if we endure cheerfully to the end and graduate in glory.--Theodore L. Cuyler \n The finest china in the world is burned at least three times, some of it more than three times. Dresden china is always burned three times. Why does it go through that intense fire? Once ought to be enough; twice ought to be enough. No, three times are necessary to burn that china so that the gold and the crimson are brought out more beautiful and then fastened there to stay. \n We are fashioned after the same principle in human life. Our trials are burned into us once, twice, thrice; and by God\u0027s grace these beautiful colors are there and they are there to stay forever.--Cortland Myers\n Earth\u0027s fairest flowers grow not on sunny plain,\n But where some vast upheaval rent in twain\n The smiling land...\n After the whirlwind\u0027s devastating blast,\n After the molten fire and- ashen pall,\n God\u0027s still small voice breathes healing over all\n From riven rocks and fern-clad chasms deep,\n Flow living waters as from hearts that weep,\n There in the afterglow soft dews distill\n And angels tend God\u0027s plants when night falls still,\n And the Beloved passing by that way\n Will gather lilies at the break of day -] H.D. \n 九月二日\n 「….你们蒙恩……要为基督受苦。」（腓一29）　\n 神开办了一个严紧的学校。校中许多功课，都是要在眼泪中费力研究的。裴克斯脱说：「哦，神阿，我感谢祢，因为祢给了我五十八年的训练。」他的困难变成他的胜利。 \n 我们的天父所开办的这学校，不久就要结束了；我们能受训练的日期，也一天一天减少了。让我们不要畏缩难学的功课，和逃避教鞭的惩罚了。如果我们能高高兴兴地忍耐到底，直到在荣耀中学成毕业的话，我们一定会觉得冠冕更美丽，天堂可爱了。－－克勒\n 世上最精细的瓷器，都至少经火烧过三次，有的还不止三次。掘来斯登的瓷器，总是烧三次的。为甚么瓷器要经过强烈的猛火呢？一次应当够了；两次应当够了。不，瓷器必须烧过三次，然后其上的金色和红色纔会更为美丽和牢固。 \n 人生也根据这个同样的原则。试炼一次、两次、三次地临到我们；感谢主，靠着祂的恩典，这些美丽的颜色会永久存留在我们的身上了。－－麦友\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5393.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
