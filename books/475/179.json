{"id":15136,"no":179,"title":"June 28","content":"\"A door opened in heaven.\" (Rev. 4:1)\n You must remember that John was in the Isle of Patmos, a lone, rocky, inhospitable prison, for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus. And yet to him, under such circumstances, separated from all the loved ones of Ephesus; debarred from the worship of the Church; condemned to the companionship of uncongenial fellow-captives, were vouchsafed these visions. For him, also a door was opened.\n We are reminded of Jacob, exiled from his father\u0027s house, who laid himself down in a desert place to sleep, and in his dreams beheld a ladder which united Heaven with earth, and at the top stood God.\n Not to these only, but to many more, doors have been opened into Heaven, when, so far as the world was concerned, it seemed as though their circumstances were altogether unlikely for such revelations.\n To prisoners and captives; to constant sufferers, bound by iron chains of pain to sick couches; to lonely pilgrims and wanderers; to women detained from the Lord\u0027s house by the demands of home, how often has the door been opened to Heaven.\n But there are conditions. You must know what it is to be in the Spirit; you must be pure in heart and obedient in faith; you must be willing to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ; then when God is all in all to us, when we live, move and have our being in His favor, to us also will the door be opened. --Daily Devotional Commentary.\n \"God hath His mountains bleak and bare,\n Where He doth bid us rest awhile;\n Crags where we breathe a purer air,\n Lone peaks that catch the day\u0027s first smile.\n \"God hath His deserts broad and brown--\n A solitude--a sea of sand,\n Where He doth let heaven\u0027s curtain down,\n Unknit by His Almighty hand.\"　\n 　 六月二十八日\n “见天上有门开了”(启四：1) 。\n 　　你一定记得约翰为神的道，并为耶稣作的见证，曾囚在那名叫拔摩的海岛上——一个凄凉，冷落，荒野的监狱里。离开了以弗所的亲人；断绝了教会中的交通；所接触的，尽是些不相投的俘虏。在这种境遇之下，神会给他这样大的异象。在他无路可走的时候，神给他开了天上的门。\n 　　我们也记得雅各曾离开了父家，躺卧在一个荒寂的旷野里，梦见一个梯子立在地上，梯子的一头顶着天，耶和华站在梯子以上。\n 　　不只这两个人，还有许多信徒，从世界的眼光看来，他们的境遇未必能使他们得到这种启示；可是事实上，他们都曾看见天上有门为他们开了。\n 　　许多囚犯俘虏，许多被痛苦的铁链束缚在病榻上的长期受苦者，许多孤单漂泊的旅客，许多被家务缠累不能来聚会的妇女们，都曾看见过天上的门为她们打开了。\n 　　但是有条件的啊！我们要看见天上的门打开，必须知道怎样生活在灵里；必须有一颗清洁顺服的心；必须象保罗一样将万事当作有损的，以认识我们的主基督耶稣为至宝。等到我们把神当作一切的一切的时候，等到我们一举一动都蒙他喜悦的时候，天上的门自然也会为我们打开了。——译自日诚报\n 这一带寂寞的荒山，\n 神指定为我们休息的地方，\n 在悬崖上呼吸新鲜的空气，\n 在孤峰上欣赏微笑的曙光。\n 这一带黄沙万里，\n 极目无垠，广若海洋，\n 他亲手解开天国的帷幕，\n 在这里垂挂，在这里悬张。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5182.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
