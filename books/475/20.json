{"id":14977,"no":20,"title":"January 20","content":"\"Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.\" (Eccles. 7:3) When sorrow comes under the power of Divine grace, it works out a manifold ministry in our lives. Sorrow reveals unknown depths in the soul, and unknown capabilities of experience and service. Gay, trifling people are always shallow, and never suspect the little meannesses in their nature. Sorrow is God\u0027s plowshare that turns up and subsoils the depths of the soul, that it may yield richer harvests. If we had never fallen, or were in a glorified state, then the strong torrents of Divine joy would be the normal force to open up all our souls\u0027 capacities; but in a fallen world, sorrow, with despair taken out of it, is the chosen power to reveal ourselves to ourselves. Hence it is sorrow that makes us think deeply, long, and soberly. Sorrow makes us go slower and more considerately, and introspect our motives and dispositions. It is sorrow that opens up within us the capacities of the heavenly life, and it is sorrow that makes us willing to launch our capacities on a boundless sea of service for God and our fellows. We may suppose a class of indolent people living at the base of a great mountain range, who had never ventured to explore the valleys and canyons back in the mountains; and some day, when a great thunderstorm goes careening through the mountains, it turns the hidden glens into echoing trumpets, and reveals the inner recesses of the valley, like the convolutions of a monster shell, and then the dwellers at the foot of the hills are astonished at the labyrinths and unexplored recesses of a region so near by, and yet so little known. So it is with many souls who indolently live on the outer edge of their own natures until great thunderstorms of sorrow reveal hidden depths within that were never hitherto suspected. God never uses anybody to a large degree, until after He breaks that one all to pieces. Joseph had more sorrow than all the other sons of Jacob, and it led him out into a ministry of bread for all nations. For this reason, the Holy Spirit said of him, \"Joseph is a fruitful bough … by a well, whose branches run over the wall\" (Gen. 49:22). It takes sorrow to widen the soul. ━The Heavenly Life. The dark brown mould\u0027s upturned By the sharp-pointed plow; And I\u0027ve a lesson learned. My life is but a field, Stretched out beneath God\u0027s sky, Some harvest rich to yield. Where grows the golden grain? Where faith? Where sympathy? In a furrow cut by pain. ━Maltbie D. Babcock. Every person and every nation must take lessons in God\u0027s school of adversity. \"We can say, \u0027Blessed is night, for it reveals to us the stars.\u0027 In the same way we can say, \u0027Blessed is sorrow, for it reveals God\u0027s comfort.\u0027 The floods washed away home and mill, all the poor man had in the world. But as he stood on the scene of his loss, after the water had subsided, broken-hearted and discouraged, he saw something shining in the bank which the waters had washed bare. \u0027It looks like gold,\u0027 he said. It was gold. The flood which had beggared him made him rich. So it is ofttimes in life.\" ━H. C. Trumbull. 　 　 一月二十日 “忧愁强如喜笑，因为面带愁容，终必使心喜乐” （传七：3） 　　在神的恩典下，有时也有忧愁临到，作我们生命上的益处。忧愁不是罣虑，忧愁常会带领我们进入更深。终日嘻嘻哈哈的人，常是浅薄的人。忧愁是神的犁头，掘到土的深处，地就能多结果子。如果我们从来没有堕落过，我们就不需要忧愁；我们只需要属天的喜乐鼓励我们进入更深；可是我们曾堕落过，我们就需要忧愁带领我们省察，痛悔，认识自己。所以忧愁常使我们多思想多考虑。 　　忧愁使我们想得更周到，不致操之过急，以及深深体察我们的动机和目标。忧愁可以从我们的内心启发天堂生活，使我们愿意施展我们的力量，对神和人类作无穷的服务。 　　我们不妨设想一群懒惰的人，住在山岭之下，他们从未一探山中的峡谷与岩穴；有一天，大雷雨扫荡这山岭，在那些峡谷岩穴之间呼啸回荡，声若擂鼓，揭露了山谷内部的深奥幽秘，象个盘旋曲折的大螺壳。然后，住在山麓的居民，对于这近在咫尺而从未接触过并且素不熟悉的迷津，大感惊异。许多得过且过祇在人性浮面生活的人，也是如此，直到要受到了大雷雨似的打击，他们纔窥见灵魂的深奥。 　 　　凡被神大用的人，神先要使他的心片片破碎。约瑟比雅各布其余的儿子所遭遇的愁烦更多，神却使他负起了拯救一切民族的使命，因此圣灵说：“约瑟是多结果子的树枝，是泉旁多结果的枝子，他的枝条探出墙外。”（创四九：22）。这是需要忧愁来开拓灵魂。━属天的生命 尖锐的犂耙， 翻开了棕褐色的泥土； 使我得到了启示。 我的生命就像一块田地， 伸展在天空之下， 等待未来的丰年。 何来金黄的谷穗？ 何来信心？何来同情？ 乃是被犂耙耕得粉碎的泥土。 ━巴伯哥格 　　每一个人和每一个国家，都必须在神所赐的逆境中接受教训。我们能够说：“夜是有福的，因为夜显示了星星”。我们同样可以说：“忧愁是有福的，因为忧愁显示了神的安慰”。洪水冲走了穷人的家和磨坊，这是他仅有的财产，当洪水退去之后，而他心碎地站在那遭劫的地点，却看到被洪水冲刷过的竿上有些亮晶晶的东西。“好像金子“，他说。真是金子，曾使他的财产一扫而光的洪水，却亦能使他成了富翁，人生亦常如此。 ━崔伦保","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4841.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
