{"id":14987,"no":30,"title":"January 30","content":"\"I will be as the dew unto Israel.\" (Hosea 14:5) \n \n The dew is a source of freshness. It is nature\u0027s provision for renewing the face of the earth. It falls at night, and without it the vegetation would die. It is this great value of the dew which is so often recognized in the Scriptures. It is used as the symbol of spiritual refreshing. Just as nature is bathed in dew, so the Lord renews His people. In Titus 3:5 the same thought of spiritual refreshing is connected with the ministry of the Holy Ghost━\"renewing of the Holy Ghost.\" \n \n Many Christian workers do not recognize the importance of the heavenly dew in their lives, and as a result they lack freshness and vigor. Their spirits are drooping for lack of dew. \n \n Beloved fellow-worker, you recognize the folly of a laboring man attempting to do his day\u0027s work without eating. Do you recognize the folly of a servant of God attempting to minister without eating of the heavenly manna? Nor will it suffice to have spiritual nourishment occasionally. Every day you must receive the renewing of the Holy Ghost. You know when your whole being is pulsating with the vigor and freshness of Divine life and when you feel jaded and worn. Quietness and absorption bring the dew. At night when the leaf and blade are still, the vegetable pores are open to receive the refreshing and invigorating bath; so spiritual dew comes from quiet lingering in the Master\u0027s presence. Get still before Him. Haste will prevent your receiving the dew. Wait before God until you feel saturated with His presence; then go forth to your next duty with the conscious freshness and vigor of Christ. ━Dr. Pardington. \n \n Dew will never gather while there is either heat or wind. The temperature must fall, and the wind cease, and the air come to a point of coolness and rest━absolute rest, so to speak━before it can yield up its invisible particles of moisture to bedew either herb or flower. So the grace of God does not come forth to rest the soul of man until the still point is fairly and fully reached. ━Selected \n \n \"Drop Thy still dews of quietness, \n \n Till all our strivings cease: \n \n Take from our souls the strain and stress; \n \n And let our ordered lives confess \n \n The beauty of Thy peace. \n \n \"Breathe through the pulses of desire \n \n Thy coolness and Thy balm; \n \n Let sense be dumb, its beats expire: \n \n Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire, \n \n O still small voice of calm!\" \n \n 一月三十日 \n \n “我必向以色列如甘露” （何十四：5） \n \n 　　露是代表新鲜，朝气，活泼。神降露原是为着更新大地，滋润花草。圣经中也常说起露，用来表明属灵的更新。神常藉圣灵更新祂的子民，犹如用露更新大地一般。在提多三章五章所说的：“圣灵的更新”就是讲圣灵有露珠一般的执事。 \n \n 　　许多神的仆人不懂得属灵的露珠在他们生命中的重要。结果，他们没有活泼，缺乏朝气。他们的灵性下沉（甚至枯萎）就是因为没有灵露的更新。 \n \n 　　亲爱的同工，你想一个工人能不吃东西，而整天作工么？你想一个神的工人能不吃属灵的吗哪，而专一事奉么？不，绝对不能。偶然吃一次也是不彀的。你必须每天接受圣灵的更新当作你灵性的滋养。怎样去接受神的灵露呢？安静，吸收。到了深夜寂静时，花草叶子的气孔都张开了，这时候正是他们受露珠的时候；属灵的露珠也是这样，当我们在神前安静等待的时候，我们就会得到更新和滋润。急躁不会叫你得到甚么。安静等待，直到你浸沉在主的同在里；然后带着基督的新鲜和活泼到工场里去。━巴亭登 \n \n 　　有风或是有热的时候，露珠凝结不起来。风必须平静，热度必须下降，大气必须到又静又冷的一点，露珠纔能凝结在叶子或花瓣上。照样，神更新的恩典，也是如此；必须等到你的火气退去，你灵安静，然后神纔降甘露滋润你。━选 \n \n 滴下祢安静的灵珠， \n \n 让我们也一切宁静， \n \n 卸却灵魂的紧张与重负， \n \n 在生活中反映出祢的美丽和平意境。 \n \n 为人欲而奔腾的脉搏， \n \n 需要一剂镇定与清凉， \n \n 不必再狂跳和慌张， \n \n 风火地震的大变动中，依旧宁静安详。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4851.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
