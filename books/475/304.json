{"id":15261,"no":304,"title":"October 31","content":"\"Likewise also the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what to pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God\" (Rom. 8:26-27) \n This is the deep mystery of prayer. This is the delicate divine mechanism which words cannot interpret, and which theology cannot explain, but which the humblest believer knows even when he does not understand. \n Oh, the burdens that we love to bear and cannot understand! Oh, the inarticulate out-reachings of our hearts for things we cannot comprehend! And yet we know they are an echo from the throne and a whisper from the heart of God. It is often a groan rather than a song, a burden rather than a buoyant wing. But it is a blessed burden, and it is a groan whose undertone is praise and unutterable joy. It is \"a groaning which cannot be uttered.\" We could not ourselves express it always, and sometimes we do not understand any more than that God is praying in us, for something that needs His touch and that He understands. \n And so we can just pour out the fullness of our heart, the burden of our spirit, the sorrow that crushes us, and know that He hears, He loves, He understands, He receives; and He separates from our prayer all that is imperfect, ignorant and wrong, and presents the rest, with the incense of the great High Priest, before the throne on high; and our prayer is heard, accepted and answered in His name. ━A. B. Simpson \n It is not necessary to be always speaking to God or always hearing from God, to have communion with Him; there is an inarticulate fellowship more sweet than words. The little child can sit all day long beside its busy mother and, although few words are spoken on either side, and both are busy, the one at his absorbing play, the other at her engrossing work, yet both are in perfect fellowship. He knows that she is there, and she knows that he is all right. So the saint and the Saviour can go on for hours in the silent fellowship of love, and he be busy about the most common things, and yet conscious that every little thing he does is touched with the complexion of His presence, and the sense of His approval and blessing. \n And then, when pressed with burdens and troubles too complicated to put into words and too mysterious to tell or understand, how sweet it is to fall back into His blessed arms, and just sob out the sorrow that we cannot speak! ━Selected \n 十月三十一日\n 「况且我们的软弱有圣灵帮助，我们本不晓得当怎样祷告，只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息，替我们祷告。鉴察人心的，晓得圣灵的意思。因为圣灵照着神的旨意替圣徒祈求。」（罗八:26-27）\n 这是祷告的奥秘━是言语不能解释，神学不能说明的奥秘；可是最无知的信徒也能知道，虽然他也许不能明白。\n 哦，多少重担，我们背是背着，可是不明白！多少声音，我们听是听见，可是不领会！无论如何，我们知道他们是宝座上面的回声，是父神的耳语。许多时候，我们所听见的，并不是诗歌，乃是叹息；我们所背负的，并不是翅膀，乃是重担。但是这是一个有福的重担，一个带着赞美和欢乐的叹息━一个「说不出来的叹息」。有时候，我们自己也表白不出来，我们自己也不明白，只知道圣灵在我们里面祷告祂所明白的。\n 所以我们只要把我们心中所充满的重压、悲哀，一起倾倒出来，因为我们知道祂听、祂爱、祂明白、祂接受；并且祂将我们祷告中一切不完全的、愚昧的、错误的、分别出来；将其余的，和大祭司的香一同献在宝座面前；我们的祷告，靠着这位大祭司的名，得蒙垂听、悦纳、答应。━宣信\n 与神交通，不一定需要一直向神说话，或者一直听神说话的；有一种无声的交通，比言语更加甘甜。小孩子尽可以整天坐在妈妈身边，虽然两个人都不说话，两个人都很忙碌━一个忙着玩耍，一个忙着做事━可是他们两人中间却保持着极完美的交通。他知到她在那里，她知道他在那里。照样，信徒和主也可以这样保持静默的爱和交通。我们一方面尽可以顶忙碌地做日常的琐事，一方面应当知道我们所做的每一件事，是否都曾得到主的同意和祝福。\n 当我们的重担太复杂，不能用言语表达出来的时候，或者太神秘，不能明白的时候，让我们倒在主的怀中，把我们说不出来的悲哀痛哭出来！━选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5539.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
