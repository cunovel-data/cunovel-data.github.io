The only thing that helps nobody, is a dead calm. North or south, cast or west, it matters not, every wind may help towards that blessed port. Seek one thing only: keep well out to sea, and then have no fear of stormy winds. Let our prayer be that of an old Cornishman: \"O Lord, send us out to sea━out in the deep water. Here we are so close to the rocks that the first bit of breeze with the devil, we are all knocked to pieces. Lord, send us out to sea--out in the deep water, where we shall have room enough to get a glorious victory.\"--Mark Guy Pearse. \n Remember that we have no more faith at any time than we have in the hour of trial. All that will not bear to be tested is mere carnal confidence. Fair-weather faith is no faith.--C. H. Spurgeon \n 八月三十日\n 「在海上坐船，在大水中经理事务的，他们看见耶和华的作为；并祂在深水中的奇事。」（诗一○七23-24）\n 凡是风，都是叫我们的灵程得帮助的。不能帮助我们的，乃是全然无风。北风、南风、东风、西风，都没有关系，只要是风，都可以帮助我们进港。所以你应当寻求一件事：生活在海洋里，不要惧怕风雨。让我们祷告说：「哦，主啊！送我们到海洋里去━到大水中去。我们现在所在的地方太靠近岩石了，和恶魔稍微一争，我们就会撞得粉碎。主阿，送我们到海洋里去━到大水中去，在那里我们可以有够大的地域来得到荣耀的胜利。」－－披尔斯\n 在受试炼的时候，我们的信心最大。一切不能忍受试验的，都不过是肉体的信心。顺境中的信心不是信心。－－司布眞\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5326.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
