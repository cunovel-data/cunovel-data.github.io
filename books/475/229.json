I went to America some years ago with the captain of a steamer, who was a very devoted Christian. When off the coast of Newfoundland he said to me, \"The last time I crossed here, five weeks ago, something happened which revolutionized the whole of my Christian life. We had George Mueller of Bristol on board. I had been on the bridge twenty-four hours and never left it. George Mueller came to me, and said, \"Captain I have come to tell you that I must be in Quebec Saturday afternoon.\" \"It is impossible,\" I said. \"Very well, if your ship cannot take me, God will find some other way. I have never broken an engagement for fifty-seven years. Let us go down into the chart-room and pray.\" I looked at that man of God, and thought to myself, what lunatic asylum can that man have come from? I never heard of such a thing as this. \"Mr. Mueller,\" I said, \"do you know how dense this fog is?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"my eye is not on the density of the fog, but on the living God, who controls every circumstance of my life.\" He knelt down and prayed one of the most simple prayers, and when he had finished I was going to pray; but he put his hand on my shoulder, and told me not to pray. “First, you do not believe He will answer; and second I BELIEVE HE HAS, and there is no need whatever for you to pray about it.” I looked at him, and he said, \"Captain, I have known my Lord for fifty-seven years, and there has never been a single day that I have failed to get audience with the King. Get up, Captain and open the door, and you will find the fog gone.\" I got up, and the fog was indeed gone. On Saturday afternoon, George Mueller was in Quebec for his engagement.—Selected “If our love were but more simple, We should take Him at His word; And our lives would be all sunshine, In the sweetness of our Lord.”　 八月十七日 「我信神祂怎对我说，事情也要怎样成就。」（徒廿七25） 几年前我乘船到美国去。这船上的船主，是一个很热心的基督徒。当船离开纽方兰海岸的时候，他对我叙述下面一段故事：「上一次我经过此地，是在五星期前，船上发生了一件事，这件事情是我灵程上的一个大革新。在我们的乘客当中，有一位别斯脱城的穆勒先生，那时因为雾大，轮船已经停顿了二十四小时。穆勒来对我说：『船主我来告诉你：星期六下午我是一定要到桂拜城的。』我说：『这是做不到的事。』他说：『很好，如果你的船不能叫我按时到达，神有别的方法的。五十七年以来，我从来没有对人失过约，让我们下去祷告。』 「我呆望着这位神的人，心中想：这个人不知道从那一家疯人院里出来的？我从来没有听见过这样的话。我就对他说：『穆勒先生，你知不知道雾有多么厚？』祂答道：『不，我的眼睛并不看雾的厚薄，我的眼睛只看见活的神，祂是管理我一生的环境的。』 「他跪下来作了一个很简单的祷告，当他做完了，我正想接下去做的时候，他放他的手在我的肩背上，叫我不要做了。他说：『第一，你不相信神会答应你；第二，我相信神已经答应了，用不着你再求了。』 「我呆呆地望着他，他对我说：『船主，我已经认识我的主五十七年了；在这五十七年中，神从来没有一次不听我过。起来，船主把门打开，你要看见雾已经全消了。』我立起身来，雾果然已经全消了。星期六下午，穆勒如约到了桂拜城。」－－选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5313.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
