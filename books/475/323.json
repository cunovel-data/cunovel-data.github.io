{"id":15280,"no":323,"title":"November 19","content":"“Thou, who hast showed us many and sore troubles, wilt quicken us again”(Ps.71:20,) God shows us the troubles. Sometimes, as this part of our education is being carried forward, we have to descend into \"the lower parts of the earth,\" pass through subterranean passages, lie buried amongst the dead, but never for a moment is the cord of fellowship and union between God and us strained to breaking; and from the depths God will bring us again. Never doubt God! Never say that He has forsaken or forgotten. Never think that He is unsympathetic. He will quicken again. There is always a smooth piece in every skein, however tangled. The longest day at last rings out the evensong. The winter snow lies long, but it goes at last. Be steadfast; your labor is not in vain. God turns again, and comforts. And when He does, the heart which had forgotten its Psalmody breaks out in jubilant song, as does the Psalmist:“I will thank thee, I will harp unto thee, my lips shall sing aloud.”━Selected “ Though the rain may fall and the wind be blowing﹐ And cold and chill is the wintry blast; Though the cloudy sky is still cloudier growing﹐ And the dead leaves tell that the summer has passed; My face I hold to the stormy heaven, My heart is as calm as the summer sea, Glad to receive what my God has given﹐ Whate\u0027er it be﹒ When I feel the cold, I can say, \u0027He sends it,’ And His winds blow blessing, I surely know; For I\u0027ve never a want but that He attends it; And my heart beats warm﹐though the winds may blow.” 十一月十九日 「你是叫我们多经历重大急难的，必使我们复活。」（诗七十一:20） 神是叫我们经历急难的。有时，祂教我们进入「地的深处」（赛四十四23），行走隐秘的道路，埋在死人中间；虽然这样，神和我们中间的交通和联合是没有一刻间断的。神既叫我们进入「深处」，也必从「深处」带领我们出来。 信徒阿，你不要对神怀疑！你不要说神已经弃绝你了、忘记你了。你不要想祂不和你表同情。白日无论如何长，总要完结的。冬日雪无论如何厚，总要融化的。 你当站住；你的工作不是徒然的。神必安慰你。那时，你就要高唱凯歌了。━选 雨或许还要下,风或许还要吹, 冬季的寒流锐如刀刺； 天上的阴云层层密布, 落叶告诉我们,夏季已逝； 我仰脸对着暴风雨的天空, 我的心平静如夏日的红霓, 愿意接受神所赐的一切, 不管是劳苦还是安息。 感觉冷时,我说:「这是神所赐」, 我确知祂的风带来吉兆； 我一无所求,只望祂随风而至, 虽然风吹雨打,我心依旧欢跳。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5558.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
