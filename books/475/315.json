{"id":15272,"no":315,"title":"November 11","content":"“He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass”(Ps.72:6) Amos speaks of the king\u0027s mowings. Our King has many scythes, and is perpetually mowing His lawns. The musical tinkle of the whetstone on the scythe portends the cutting down of myriads of green blades, daisies and other flowers. Beautiful as they were in the morning, within an hour or two they lie in long, faded rows. Thus in human life we make a brave show, before the scythe of pain, the shears of disappointment, the sickle of death. There is no method of obtaining a velvety lawn but by repeated mowings; and there is no way of developing tenderness, evenness, sympathy, but by the passing of God\u0027s scythes. How constantly the Word of God compares man to grass, and His glory to its flower! But when grass is mown, and all the tender shoots are bleeding, and desolation reigns where flowers were bursting, it is the most acceptable time for showers of rain falling soft and warm. O soul, thou hast been mown! Time after time the King has come to thee with His sharp scythe. Do not dread the scythe—it is sure to be followed by the shower. ━F. B. Meyer “When across the heart deep waves of sorrow, Break, as on a dry and barren shore; When hope glistens with no bright tomorrow, And the storm seems sweeping evermore;” “When the cup of every earthly gladness, Bears no taste of the life-giving stream; And high hopes, as though to mock our sadness, Fade and die as in some fitful dream,” “Who shall hush the weary spirit\u0027s chiding? Who the aching void within shall fill? Who shall whisper of c peace abiding, And each surging billow calmly still?” “Only He whose wounded heart was broken With the bitter cross and thorny crown; Whose dear love glad words of joy had spoken, Who His life for us laid meekly down. ” “Blessed Healer, all our burdens lighten; Give us peace, Thine own sweet peace, we pray ! Keep us near Thee till the morn shall brighten, And all the mists and shadows flee away ! ” 十一月十一日 「祂必降临，像雨降在已割的草地上。」（诗七十二:6） 阿摩司曾谈到列王割草的事。我们的王有许多镰刀,永远在刈割祂的草地,磨刀霍霍之声,预告着要割去草的数种绿叶,和雏菊等一些杂在草中的野花。虽然,它们在早晨很美丽,不出一两个钟头,那被割的部份都要倒入枯萎的行列之中。 人生也同样在其痛苦的刈割,失望的收剪,和伤残的芟削之前,表现出勇敢的精神。 要得到一块柔润的草地，唯一的方法就是常常割草；要得到一个温柔、和平、怜悯的心，唯一的方法就是常经神的镰刀割修。当草刚割好，嫩枝还在出血的时候，能有一阵柔细、温暖的小雨降在上面，是非常舒服的。所以经上也说：「….雨降在已割的草地上。」 信徒阿，你是不是正在被神的镰刀修割呢？不要怕镰刀━镰刀后面定规有细雨跟着的。━梅尔 当悲哀的巨浪掠过心头, 像冲上了荒凉的海岸, 当前途黯淡,失去了光辉, 暴风雨似乎永无止限; 当每一只尘世欢乐之杯, 尝不出生命之泉的甘味; 当希望似在讥笑着我们的悲哀, 而彷佛在捉摸不定的梦中消退。 谁会充填痛苦的空虚; 谁会平息精疲力竭的怨声? 谁会高唱永久和平之歌? 使汹涌的浪涛变得安宁? 唯有祂,十字架和荆冠, 破碎了祂那受伤心肠, 祂为我们忍受羞辱与谦卑, 祂的爱说出了喜悦的福音。 赐福之救主,减轻了我们的负担; 求祢把甜美的平安赐给我们! 使我们靠近祢,直到雾浓和阴影, 完全消隐,天色光明!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5550.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
