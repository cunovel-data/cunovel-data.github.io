Walking past a vineyard in the rich autumnal glow she noticed the untrimmed appearance and the luxuriant wealth of leaves on the vines, that the ground was given over to a tangle of weeds and grass, and that the whole place looked utterly uncared for; and as she pondered, the Heavenly Gardener whispered so precious a message that she would fain pass it on:\n \"My dear child, are you wondering at the sequence of trials in your life? Behold that vineyard and learn of it. The gardener ceases to prune, to trim, to harrow, or to pluck the ripe fruit only when he expects nothing more from the vine during that season. It is left to itself, because the season of fruit is past and further effort for the present would yield no profit. Comparative uselessness is the condition of freedom from suffering. Do you then wish me to cease pruning your life? Shall I leave you alone?\" And the comforted heart cried, \"No!\"━Homera Homer-Dixon\n It is the branch that bears the fruit,\n That feels the knife,\n To prune it for a larger growth,\n A fuller life.\n Though every budding twig be lopped,\n And every grace\n Of swaying tendril, springing leaf,\n Be lost a space.\n O thou whose life of joy seems reft\n Of beauty shorn;\n Whose aspirations lie in dust,\n All bruised and torn,\n Rejoice, tho\u0027 each desire, each dream,\n Each hope of thine\n Shall fall and fade; it is the hand\n Of Love Divine\n That holds the knife, that cuts and breaks\n With tenderest touch,\n That thou, whose life has borne some fruit\n May\u0027st now bear much.\n ━Annie Johnson Flint　\n 二月十九日\n “凡结果子的，他就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多” （约十五：2）\n 　　有一个神的孩子正希奇像她这样爱主的信徒，为甚么神还要使她落在百般的试炼中呢？有一次，她走过一个葡萄园，看见里边有许多的葡萄藤，未经修剪枝子繁多，叶子茂盛，四周长了无数的杂草，地上堆了许多的枯叶；显然是一个完全没有人经营的荒园；当她站着沉思的时侯，神就光照她给她看见一段顶宝贝的信息。\n 　　“我所爱的孩子阿，你是不是在希奇你一生的遭遇呢？你看这个葡萄园，从其中学习一个功课吧。园丁不替它修剪不结果的枝子，不摘去不需要的叶子，不除去害虫和杂草，要不要我把你放在一边呢”？她的心受了安慰大声说道：“不！不！”━狄克生\n 结果子的枝干，\n 才会受到剪栽，\n 为了帮助它的生长，\n 结出更多的果子来。\n 摇曳生姿的细枝，\n 含苞欲放的蓓蕾，\n 青葱可爱的嫩芽，\n ━都会摧残。\n 欢乐的生命，\n 摧残得黯淡无光，\n 抱负化为尘土，\n 磨折得遍体鳞伤。\n 你一切欲望，\n 一切希求和幻梦，\n 都将化为泡影，\n 你要欢喜，你要庆幸。\n 那是神执着刀，\n 细心在给你修剪，\n 使你结果子的生命，\n 更为丰富繁衍。\n ━富林德\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4865.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
