A delay in Abram\u0027s own lifetime that seemed to put God\u0027s pledge beyond fulfillment was followed by seemingly unendurable delay of Abram\u0027s descendants. But it was only a delay: they “came out with great substance.”(Ex.12:36)The pledge was redeemed. \\n\\n God is going to test me with delays; and with the delays will come suffering, but through it all stands God\u0027s pledge: His new covenant with me in Christ, and His inviolable promise of every lesser blessing that I need. The delay and the suffering are part of the promised blessing; let me praise Him for them today; and let me wait on the Lord and be of good courage and He will strengthen my heart.━C. G. Trumbull\\n\\n Unanswered yet the prayer your lips have pleaded\\n\\n In agony of heart these many years?\\n\\n Does faith begin to fail? Is hope departing?\\n\\n And think you all in vain those falling tears?\\n\\n Say not the Father hath not heard your prayer;\\n\\n You shall have your desire sometime, somewhere.\\n\\n Unanswered yet? Nay do not say ungranted;\\n\\n Perhaps your work is not yet wholly done.\\n\\n The work began when first your prayer was uttered,\\n\\n And God will finish what He has begun.\\n\\n If you will keep the incense burning there,\\n\\n His glory you shall see sometime, somewhere.\\n\\n Unanswered yet? Faith cannot be unanswered,\\n\\n Her feet are firmly planted on the Rock;\\n\\n Amid the wildest storms she stands undaunted,\\n\\n Nor quails before the loudest thunder shock.\\n\\n She knows Omnipotence has heard her prayer,\\n\\n And cries, “It shall be done”–sometime, somewhere.\\n\\n ━Miss Ophelia G.
