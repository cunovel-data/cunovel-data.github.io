{"id":15248,"no":291,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"\"Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs;…they shall afflict them four hundred years;... and afterward they shall come out with great substance\" (Gen. 15:12-14) An assured part of God\u0027s pledged blessing to us is delay and suffering. A delay in Abram\u0027s own lifetime that seemed to put God\u0027s pledge beyond fulfillment was followed by seemingly unendurable delay of Abram\u0027s descendants. But it was only a delay: they “came out with great substance.”(Ex.12:36)The pledge was redeemed. God is going to test me with delays; and with the delays will come suffering, but through it all stands God\u0027s pledge: His new covenant with me in Christ, and His inviolable promise of every lesser blessing that I need. The delay and the suffering are part of the promised blessing; let me praise Him for them today; and let me wait on the Lord and be of good courage and He will strengthen my heart.━C. G. Trumbull Unanswered yet the prayer your lips have pleaded In agony of heart these many years? Does faith begin to fail? Is hope departing? And think you all in vain those falling tears? Say not the Father hath not heard your prayer; You shall have your desire sometime, somewhere. Unanswered yet? Nay do not say ungranted; Perhaps your work is not yet wholly done. The work began when first your prayer was uttered, And God will finish what He has begun. If you will keep the incense burning there, His glory you shall see sometime, somewhere. Unanswered yet? Faith cannot be unanswered, Her feet are firmly planted on the Rock; Amid the wildest storms she stands undaunted, Nor quails before the loudest thunder shock. She knows Omnipotence has heard her prayer, And cries, “It shall be done”–sometime, somewhere. ━Miss Ophelia G. Browning 十月十八日 「你要的确知道，你的后裔必寄居别人的地…那地的人要苦待他们四百年…后来他们必带着许多财物，从那里出来。」（创十五:12-14） 神给我们的祝福中间，有两个是我们所最不欢迎的：一个是迟延，一个是苦难。神给埃布尔兰本身的一个誓约尚未实现，现在又给他的后裔一个同样彷佛不可忍耐的誓约。但是无论如何，这些誓约虽然迟延，至终都得到了实现：以色列人出埃及的时候，果然「把埃及人的财物夺去了」（出十二:36） 神常用迟延和苦难来试验我们；但是在这一切中间却站着神的誓约━祂在基督里与我们所立的新约。所以让我们为着迟延和苦难来赞美祂罢，因为这是祂给我们的祝福。━崔伦保 多年来你从苦痛中发生的祷告， 是不是至如今还没有得到回音？ 信心在消沉，希望在幻灭吗？ 你可是灰心得泪下沿襟？ 莫说天父未曾听到你的祈祷， 总有一天,你期望的音讯必然降临。 还没有回音？莫说未蒙接受, 也许你的事还有全部完工。 在你首次祈祷时就动手, 神作诸事向来有始有终。 只要你继续虔诚崇拜, 某时某地你必见祂荣光。 还没有回音？信心决不会徒劳, 她坚定安稳,如在盘石植根； 在最响的霹雳之下不丧胆, 在狂风暴雨里显出坚贞, 她知道全能的神已听见祈祷, 高喊道:「某时某地,这事必成-------。」 ━布兰宁","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5526.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
