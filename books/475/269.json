Self may want us to; and Satan may want us to. But God wants us to face facts, not feelings; the facts of Christ and of His finished and perfect work for us. \\n\\n When we face these precious facts, and believe them because God says they are facts, God will take care of our feelings.\\n\\n God never gives feeling to enable us to trust Him; God never gives feeling to encourage us to trust Him; God never gives feeling to show that we have already and utterly trusted Him. \\n\\n God gives feeling only when He sees that we trust Him apart from all feeling, resting on His own Word, and on His own faithfulness to His promise. \\n\\n Never until then can the feeling (which is from God) possibly come; and God will give the feeling in such a measure and at such a time as His love sees best for the individual case. \\n\\n We must choose between facing toward our feelings and facing toward God\u0027s facts. Our feelings may be as uncertain as the sea or the shifting sands. God\u0027s facts are as certain as the Rock of Ages, even Christ Himself, who is the same yesterday, today and forever. --Selected \\n\\n “When darkness veils His lovely face,\\n\\n I rest on His unchanging grace;\\n\\n In every high and stormy gale,\\n\\n My anchor holds within the veil.” \\n\\n 九月二十六日\\n\\n 「……我们行事为人，是凭着信心，不是凭着眼见。」（林后五7）\\n\\n 神不要我们凭感觉。「己」要我们凭感觉，撒但要我们凭感觉，但是神要我们凭事实━凭基督已经为我们完成的事实。\\n\\n 神从来不用感觉来吸引我们去信靠祂；神也从来不用感觉来鼓励我们去信靠祂。\\n\\n 那么，甚么时候神纔给我们一些感觉呢？当神看见我们已经能不凭感觉来信靠祂，安息在祂的话语、信实、应许上的时候，祂就给我们一些感觉。\\n\\n 不到那个时候，感觉是不会来的。但是神知道该给我们的分量和时间，因为祂知道各人的情形和需要。 \\n\\n 我们必须选择：我们究竟愿意凭依我们的感觉呢？还是凭依神的事实？我们的感觉像海沙那般不可靠；神的事实像永久的盘石那般稳固，因为耶稣基督昨日、今日，一直到永远是一样的。－－选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5417.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
