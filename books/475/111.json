{"id":15068,"no":111,"title":"April 21","content":"\"And being absolutely certain that whatever promise He is bound by, He is able to make good.\" (Rom. 4:21) We are told that Abraham could look at his own body and consider it as good as dead without being discouraged, because he was not looking at himself but at the Almighty One. He did not stagger at the promise, but stood straight up unbending beneath his mighty load of blessing; and instead of growing weak he waxed strong in the faith, grew more robust, the more difficulties became apparent, glorifying God through His very sufficiency and being \"fully persuaded\" (as the Greek expresses it) \"that he who had promised was,\" not merely able, but as it literally means \"abundantly able,\" munificently able, able with an infinite surplus of resources, infinitely able \"to perform.\" He is the God of boundless resources. The only limit is in us. Our asking, our thinking, our praying are too small; our expectations are too limited. He is trying to lift us up to a higher conception, and lure us on to a mightier expectation and appropriation. Oh, shall we put Him in derision? There is no limit to what we may ask and expect of our glorious El-Shaddai; and there is but one measure here given for His blessing, and that is \"according to the power that worketh in us.\" --A. B. Simpson. \"Climb to the treasure house of blessing on the ladder made of divine promises. By a promise as by a key open the door to the riches of God\u0027s grace and favor.\" 四月二十一日　 “满心相信，神所应许的必能作成”（罗四：21）。 　　亚伯拉罕将近百岁的时候，虽然想到自己的身体如同已死，还是不失望，因为他不看自己，只看全能的神。 　　他对于神的应许没有丝毫疑惑，他直立在神的恩典之下，一点也不气馁；他的信心非但不软弱，并且愈过愈强，将荣耀归给神；且“满心相信，神所应许的必能作成”。不只能，直译起来，是“丰丰富富的能”，宽宽厚厚的能，无限量的能“作成”。 　　神是万有之神，他不受限制。所有的限制都是我们自己造成的。我们所求的，所想的，所盼望的，太小了，不够彰显神原有的荣耀和大能。神要我们有一个扩大的眼界，因为他是全能的者，难道我们要辜负他的美意吗？我们向全能的神有所要求，是没有限度的，他之赐福于你，却有一个准绳，就是以你的信心程度的深浅多寡为标准。——信宣 　　我们可以用神的应许来作梯子，爬到神的宝藏室去。每一个应许，是开恩典之门的一个钥匙。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5047.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
