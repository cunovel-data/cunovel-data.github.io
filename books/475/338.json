{"id":15295,"no":338,"title":"December 4","content":"\"He went up into a mountain apart\" (Matt.14:23)\\n\\n One of the blessings of the old-time Sabbath was its calm, its restfulness, its holy peace. There is a strange strength conceived in solitude. Crows go in flocks and wolves in packs, but the lion and the eagle are solitaires.\\n\\n Strength is not in bluster and noise. Strength is in quietness. The lake must be calm if the heavens are to be reflected on its surface. Our Lord loved the people, but how often we read of His going away from them for a brief season. He tried every little while to withdraw from the crowd. He was always stealing away at evening to the hills. Most of His ministry was carried on in the towns and cities by the seashore, but He loved the hills the best, and oftentimes when night fell He would plunge into their peaceful depths.\\n\\n The one thing needed above all others today is that we shall go apart with our Lord, and sit at His feet in the sacred privacy of His blessed presence. Oh, for the lost art of meditation! Oh, for the culture of the secret place! Oh, for the tonic of waiting upon God! ━Selected\\n\\n \"It is well to live in the valley sweet,\\n\\n Where the work of the world is done,\\n\\n Where the reapers sing in the fields of wheat,\\n\\n As they toil till the set of sun.\\n\\n But beyond the meadows, the hills I see\\n\\n Where the noises of traffic cease,\\n\\n And I follow a Voice that calleth to me\\n\\n From the hilltop regions of peace.”\\n\\n \"Aye, to live is sweet in the valley fair,\\n\\n And to toil till the set of sun;\\n\\n But my spirit yearns for the hilltop\u0027s air\\n\\n When the day and its work are done.\\n\\n For a Presence breathes o\u0027er the silent hills,\\n\\n And its sweetness is living yet;\\n\\n The same deep calm all the hillside fills,\\n\\n As breathed over Olivet.”\\n\\n \"Every life that would be strong must have its Holy of Holies into which only God enters.\" \\n\\n 十二月四日 \\n\\n 「祂就独自上山去祷告。」 （太十四:23）\\n\\n 古代安息日的福祉之一，就是它的幽寂与安静。寂静里面含蓄着一种奇异的能力。乌鸦和豺狼是喜欢集群的，狮子和鹫鹰，是喜欢单独的。 \\n\\n 能力不在喧扰中，乃在安静中。湖水必须极其平静，纔能在面上映照出美丽的天空来。我们的主是极其爱世人的，可是多少次我们在经上读到祂暂时离开群众，退去祷告。祂工作的地方常在海边，可是祂最爱山上。所以我们看见祂晚间常上山去休息。 \\n\\n 今天我们所最需要的一件事，乃是独自与主亲近，坐在祂脚前安静。哦，巴不得我们能恢复那已失去的默想的艺术！哦，巴不得我们能受到密室的教育！━选 \\n\\n 生活在这山谷中，多么美好， \\n\\n 我们的工作就在这里完成， \\n\\n 收割的农人在麦田里歌唱， \\n\\n 他们辛勤到日落黄昏。 \\n\\n 但我望见草原外的山巅， \\n\\n 那里没有一点喧嚣的市声， \\n\\n 我跟随着一个呼唤我的声音， \\n\\n 它发自宁静的峰顶。 \\n\\n 不错,住在山谷里多么美好，\\n\\n 辛勤地耕作到日落黄昏； \\n\\n 但当一日工作结束的时辰， \\n\\n 我心向往着山顶。 \\n\\n 因为有位神曾在山上吹气， \\n\\n 那甜美的气息存留至今； \\n\\n 和昔日在橄榄山一样， \\n\\n 所有的峰峦弥满着宁静。 \\n\\n 「任何生命要想坚强，都必须有一个让神进入的至圣所。」\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5573.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
