Rather look at them with full hope that, as they arise, God, whose you are, will deliver you out of them. He has kept you hitherto; do you but hold fast to His dear hand, and He will lead you safely through all things; and when you cannot stand, He will bear you in His arms.\n Do not look forward to what may happen tomorrow. The same everlasting Father who cares for you today will take care of you tomorrow, and every day. Either He will shield you from suffering or He will give you unfailing strength to bear it. Be at peace, then, put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginations. ━Frances do Sales\n \"The Lord is my shepherd….\"(Ps.23:1)\n Not was, not may be, nor will be. \"The Lord is my shepherd,\" is on Sunday, is on Monday, and is through every day of the week; is in January, is in December, and every month of the year; is at home, and is in China; is in peace, and, is in war; in abundance, and in penury. ━J. Hudson Taylor\n HE will silently plan for thee,\n Object thou of omniscient care;\n God Himself undertakes to be\n Thy Pilot through each subtle snare.\n He WILL silently plan for thee,\n So certainly, He cannot fail!\n Rest on the faithfulness of God,\n In Him thou surely shalt prevail.\n He will SILENTLY plan for thee\n Some wonderful surprise of love.\n Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,\n But it is kept for thee above.\n He will silently PLAN for thee,\n His purposes shall all unfold;\n The tangled skein shall shine at last,\n A masterpiece of skill untold.\n He will silently plan FOR THEE,\n Happy child of a Father\u0027s care,\n As though no other claimed His love,\n But thou alone to Him wert dear.\n ━E. Mary Grimes\n 二月八日\n “我…常与你们同在，直到世界的末了”（太二十八：20）\n 　　不要带着惧怕的心去看前面将临的事。要带着盼望去看牠们，因为主是我们的主，必要带领我们一步一步过去。祂常与你同在；你只要紧紧抓住祂的手，祂会引导你安然经过一切的；当你软弱无力，站立不住的时侯，祂会将你怀抱在祂大能的膀臂中。\n 　　不要为明天忧虑。永活的神今天旣然看顾你，明天，每一天，也必定会同样看顾你。有时祂不叫你遇见试探，有时祂加你力量使你能忍受试探。所以放心抛弃一切焦急的意念和烦恼的理想。━赛尔斯\n 　　“耶和华是我的牧者…”（诗篇二十三：1） \n 　　“是”字在原文是现在式，不是过去式“曾是”，也不是将来式“将是”，也不是未定式“或是”，“耶和华是我的牧者”，祂现在是，祂永远是。在主日是，在星期一也是，在一星期中每一天都是；在正月是，在十二月也是，在一年中每一月都是；在家里是，在外乡也是；在平安时是，在危险时也是；在富余时是，在缺乏时也是。在任何环境中都是。━戴德生\n 祂一声不响为你安排，\n 给你无微不至的关怀，\n 祂担任你的响导，\n 渡过埋伏着的陷阱与圈套。\n 祂一声不响为你安排，\n 确实可靠，决无乖差，\n 依赖神的信义，\n 你必会因祂而奏效。\n 祂一声不响为你安排，\n 出乎意料的仁爱无涯，\n 眼不曾见，耳不曾闻，\n 却在天上为你保存。\n 祂一声不响为你安排，\n 起初你不明白祂的意念，\n 这谜一样的杰作，似乎复杂，\n 最后终将祂的旨意全揭开。\n 祂一声不响为你安排，\n 好像慈父对宠儿的关怀，\n 似乎除了你以外，\n 无人为神所钟爱。\n ━格兰姆斯\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4854.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
