{"id":14970,"no":13,"title":"January 13","content":"“In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.” (Romans 8:37) \\n\\n \\n\\n This is more than victory. This is a triumph so complete that we have not only escaped defeat and destruction, but we have destroyed our enemies and won a spoil so rich and valuable that we can thank God that the battle ever came. How can we be “more than conquerors\"? We can get out of the conflict a spiritual discipline that will greatly strengthen our faith and establish our spiritual character. Temptation is necessary to settle and confirm us in the spiritual life. It is like the fire which burns in the colors of mineral painting, or like winds that cause the mighty cedars of the mountain to strike more deeply into the soil. Our spiritual conflicts are among our choicest blessings, and our great adversary is used to train us for his ultimate defeat. The ancient Phrygians had a legend that every time they conquered an enemy the victor absorbed the physical strength of his victim and added so much more to his own strength and valor. So temptation victoriously met doubles our spiritual strength and equipment. It is possible thus not only to defeat our enemy, but to capture him and make him fight in our ranks. The prophet Isaiah speaks of flying on the shoulders of the Philistines (Isa. 11:14). These Philistines were their deadly foes, but the figure suggested that they would be enabled not only to conquer the Philistines, but to use them to carry the victors on their shoulders for further triumphs. Just as the wise sailor can use a head wind to carry him forward by tacking and taking advantage of its impelling force; so it is possible for us in our spiritual life through the victorious grace of God to turn to account the things that seem most unfriendly and unfavorable, and to be able to say continually, \"The things that were against me have happened to the furtherance of the gospel.\" ━Life More Abundantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now thanks be unto God Who always leads us forth to triumph with the Anointed One, and Who diffuses by us the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (2 Cor. 2:14, literal translation.) \\n\\n \\n\\n 一月十三日 \\n\\n \\n\\n “靠着爱我们的主，在这一切的事上，已经得胜有余了“ （罗八：37） \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　得胜有余！得胜有余并不是仅仅得胜，乃是得胜到一个地步非但不输，而且还攻陷敌阵，掳掠战利品。我们如何可以“得胜有余”呢？“得胜有余”必须在一个受试炼，逼迫的处境中，方能得到。所有的试炼都是绝对必需的，试炼可以使我们的灵命坚固。这好比瓷器上的画，必须经过火烧，纔能永久存留；也像山岭上的香柏木，必须经过疾风的摇动，纔会扎根更深。我们所遭遇的属灵战争，实在是一种变相的祝福；我们的大仇敌撒但，原是被利用来训练我们，为要我们得最后胜利的。相传古时弗利家民族，每次战胜仇敌后，总把敌人的血吸尽，他们以为这样可以把敌人的体力和胆量加进自己的身体中去。不错，胜一次试炼，就是倍一次我们属灵的力量。因此，以后我们不只能胜仇敌，而且还能掳掠他们，使他们站在我们的战线上替我们争战。以赛亚说：“他们要向西飞，扑在非利士人的肩头上；一同掳掠东方人，伸手按住以东和摩押；亚们人也必须顺服他们”（赛十一：14）。非利士人是他们的敌人，但是他们不只能战胜非利士人，而且还能骑在与他们不两立的敌人肩上一同掳掠别人。正好像聪明的水手能利用大风的推动来前进一样；所以在我们属灵的生命中许多不利的逆境，因着那加我们恩典和力量的，都是使我们进入更深，更完全的机会。我们巴不得能和保罗一样说，“我所遭遇的事，更是叫福音兴旺”（腓一：12）。 ━译自《更丰盛的生命》 \\n\\n \\n\\n 　 “感谢神，常帅领我们在基督里夸胜，并藉着我们在各处显扬那因认识基督而有的香气“ （林后二：14） \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4834.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
