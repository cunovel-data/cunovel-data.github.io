{"id":15246,"no":289,"title":"October 16","content":"\"Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and, let us run with patience the race that is set before us\" (Heb.12:1) There are weights which are not sins in themselves, but which become distractions and stumbling blocks in our Christian progress. One of the worst of these is despondency. The heavy heart is indeed a weight that will surely drag us down in our holiness and usefulness. The failure of Israel to enter the land of promise began in murmuring, or, as the text in Numbers literally puts it, \"as it were murmured.\" (Ref to Num.14:29-30) Just a faint desire to complain and be discontented. This led on until it blossomed and ripened into rebellion and ruin. Let us give ourselves no liberty ever to doubt God or His love and faithfulness to us in everything and forever. We can set our will against doubt just as we do against any other sin; and as we stand firm and refuse to doubt, the Holy Spirit will come to our aid and give us the faith of God and crown us with victory. It is very easy to fall into the habit of doubting, fretting, and wondering if God has forsaken us and if after all our hopes are to end in failure. Let us refuse to be discouraged. Let us refuse to be unhappy. Let us \"count it all joy\"(Jas.1:2) when we cannot feel one emotion of happiness. Let us rejoice by faith, by resolution, by reckoning, and we shall surely find that God will make the reckoning real.━Selected The devil has two master tricks. One is to get us discouraged; then for a time at least we can be of no service to others, and so are defeated. The other is to make us doubt, thus breaking the faith link by which we are bound to our Father. Lookout! Do not be tricked either way.━G.E.M. Gladness! I like to cultivate the spirit of gladness! It puts the soul so in tune again, and keeps it in tune, so that Satan is shy of touching it━the chords of the soul become too warm, or too full of heavenly electricity, for his infernal fingers, and he goes off somewhere else! Satan is always very shy of meddling with me when my heart is full of gladness and joy in the Holy Ghost. My plan is to shun the spirit of sadness as I would Satan; but, alas! I am not always successful. Like the devil himself it meets me on the highway of usefulness, looks me so fully in my face, till my poor soul changes color! Sadness discolors everything; it leaves all objects charmless; it involves future prospects in darkness; it deprives the soul of all its aspirations, enchains all its powers, and produces a mental paralysis! An old believer remarked, that cheerfulness in religion makes all its services come off with delight; and that we are never carried forward so swiftly in the ways of duty as when borne on the wings of delight; adding, that Melancholy clips such wings; or, to alter the figure, takes off our chariot wheels in duty, and makes them, like those of the Egyptians, drag heavily.━Selected 十月十六日 「我们…就当放下各样的重担，脱去容易缠累我们的罪，存心忍耐，奔那摆在我们前头的路程。」（来十二:1） 有许多重担它们的本身并不是罪，但是会叫基督人分心，变成他们长进的障碍。其中最有害的是灰心。灰心实在是一个曳我们往下的重担。 以色列人不得进入应许之地的原因就是发怨言；民数记十四章二十九至三十节明明告诉我们：「凡…向我发怨言的，必不得进我起誓应许叫你们住的那地。」一点点鸣不平的欲望，一点点不知足的欲望，常会造成叛逆大罪。所以我们永远不当让我们自己有一点点自由来疑惑神在凡事上对我们的慈爱和信实。 我们怎样抵挡别的罪，也当照样抵挡疑惑；当我们坚拒疑惑的时候，圣灵会来帮助我们，赐给我们得胜的信心。 我们顶容易流入疑惑，怀抱不平，猜想神已经弃绝我们，我们的盼望行将破产….让我们拒绝这一切思想，因为它们的目的是要叫我们失望。让我们拒绝一切叫我们不快乐的思想。我们不能感觉喜乐的时候，让我们「以为…喜乐」（雅一:2），凭信心来喜乐；这样，神必叫我们的「以为」变成事实。━选 魔鬼有两个最大的诡计。一个就是叫我们失望；一个就是叫我们疑惑━斩断我们与父神中间的信心连索。当心啊！不要被牠的诡计欺骗了。━G.E.M. 喜乐！一个喜乐的灵能使我们的心合调，使撒但不敢前来弹奏━因为心弦太热的时候，充满了属天的电力的时候，会使撒但的手指烫痛。 应当尽力远避忧郁，好像远避撒但一样；但是多少时候，我们在大道上，遇见了它，它便钉住我们，直钉得我们的心变色。 忧郁会叫凡事变色；它会使一切东西变得「不可爱」；它会使未来的希望沦入黑暗；它会剥夺人们一切的热望，锁住人们一切的能力，给人一个精神上的麻痹。 一个经历很深的信徒告诉我们说：「喜乐能使工作顺利；当我们戴上喜乐的翅膀时，我们的工作也会做得迅速了；忧郁是剪去这种翅膀的；换言之，忧郁能挪去我们工作的车轮，使我们的车轮像埃及人的车轮一样，脱落难行。」━选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5524.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
