{"id":15098,"no":141,"title":"May 21","content":"\"I call to remembrance my song in the night.\" (Psalm 77:6)\n I have read somewhere of a little bird that will never sing the melody his master wishes while his cage is full of light. He learns a snatch of this, a bar of that, but never an entire song of its own until the cage is covered and the morning beams shut out.\n A good many people never learn to sing until the darkling shadows fall. The fabled nightingale carols with his breast against a thorn. It was in the night that the song of the angels was heard. It was at midnight that the cry came, \"Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\"\n Indeed it is extremely doubtful if a soul can really know the love of God in its richness and in its comforting, satisfying completeness until the skies are black and lowering.\n Light comes out of darkness, morning out of the womb of the night.\n James Creelman, in one of his letters, describes his trip through the Balkan States in search of Natalie, the exiled Queen of Serbia.\n \"In that memorable journey,\" he says, \"I learned for the first time that the world\u0027s supply of attar of roses comes from the Balkan Mountains. And the thing that interested me most,\" he goes on, \"is that the roses must be gathered in the darkest hours. The pickers start out at one o\u0027clock and finish picking them at two.\n \"At first it seemed to me a relic of superstition; but I investigated the picturesque mystery, and learned that actual scientific tests had proven that fully forty per cent of the fragrance of roses disappeared in the light of day.\"\n And in human life and human culture that is not a playful, fanciful conceit; it is a real veritable fact. --Malcolm J. McLeod.\n 　五月二十一日\n “我想起我夜间的歌曲”（诗七十七：6）。\n 　　据说有一种小鸟，在亮光中不会唱歌的，虽然主人竭力设法去引它出声，但它总是默然。有时偶然发出一些鸣声，但不足以代表它歌唱的艺术。只有一个方法可以使它唱出美丽悦耳的歌声来，就是在笼的上下四周罩上一层不透光的黑布。\n 　　有许多人都要在夜幕下降之后，才知道歌唱，传说夜莺在荆棘刺着胸口时鸣啼。夜晚才听见天使的歌颂之声，那是大喜的信息说：“新郎来了，你们出来迎接他”。（太二十五：6）这是在半夜三更，天顶黑的时候报的！\n 　　人何独不然；天色尚未黑暗，灵魂充满了自己的安逸，他能否真正领悟神爱的丰富和甘甜？倒不如在最黑暗的处境中才能有所表现。\n 　　光明是从黑暗中出来的，早晨亦自从夜晚滋长的。\n 　　詹姆斯·克里曼历访巴尔干诸国，寻找塞维亚流亡女王娜塔丽，他记述此行的信札中说：“在那值得纪念的旅程中，我第一次知道市上玫瑰香油精的原料，产自巴尔干山中。使我感到兴趣的是，玫瑰必须在黑暗的半夜方可采摘，采花工作就在短短的一二小时内完成”。\n 　　“起初我觉得这个采集方式似乎是古代迷信的遗传；后来深入调查，终于知道连科学家的实验亦证明了玫瑰花若在日光中采摘，它将损失其香味的百分之四十。”\n 　对于人类的生活和文化，确是事实，不是儿戏幻想。——马克李奥\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5130.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
