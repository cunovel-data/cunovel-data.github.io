This peace, born of conflict, is not like the deadly hush preceding the tempest, but the serene and pure-aired quiet that follows it.\\n\\n It is not generally the prosperous one, who has never sorrowed, who is strong and at rest. His quality has never been tried, and he knows not how he can stand even a gentle shock. He is not the safest sailor who never saw a tempest; he will do for fair-weather service, but when the storm is rising, place at the important post the man who has fought out a gale, who has tested the ship, who knows her hulk sound, her rigging strong, and her anchor-flukes able to grasp and hold by the ribs of the world.\\n\\n When first affliction comes upon us, how everything gives way! Our clinging, tendril hopes are snapped, and our heart lies prostrate like a vine that the storm has torn from its trellis; but when the first shock is past, and we are able to look up, and say, \"It is the Lord,\" faith lifts the shattered hopes once more, and binds them fast to the feet of God. Thus the end is confidence, safety, and peace. --Selected.\\n\\n The adverse winds blew against my life;\\n\\n My little ship with grief was tossed;\\n\\n My plans were gone--heart full of strife,\\n\\n And all my hope seemed to be lost--\\n\\n \"Then He arose\"--one word of peace.\\n\\n \"There was a calm\"--a sweet release.\\n\\n A tempest great of doubt and fear\\n\\n Possessed my mind; no light was there\\n\\n To guide, or make my vision clear.\\n\\n Dark night! \u0027twas more than I could bear--\\n\\n \"Then He arose,\" I saw His face—\\n\\n \"There was a calm\" filled with His grace.\\n\\n My heart was sinking \u0027neath the wave\\n\\n Of deepening test and raging grief;\\n\\n All seemed as lost, and none could save,\\n\\n And nothing could bring me relief--\\n\\n \"Then He arose\"--and spoke one word,\\n\\n \"There was a calm!\" IT IS THE LORD.\\n\\n --L.
