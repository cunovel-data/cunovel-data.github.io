{"id":15221,"no":264,"title":"September 21","content":"\"I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord\" (Phil. 3:8).\n This is the happy season of ripening cornfields, of the merry song of the reapers, of the secured and garnered grain. But let me hearken to the sermon of the field. This is its solemn word to me. You must die in order to live. You must refuse to consult your own case and well-being. You must be crucified, not only in desires and habits which are sinful, but in many more which appear innocent and right. \n If you would save others, you cannot save yourself. If you would bear much fruit, you must be buried in darkness and solitude. \n My heart fails me as I listen. But, when Jesus asks it, let me tell myself that it is my high dignity to enter into the fellowship of His sufferings; and thus I am in the best of company. And let me tell myself again that it is all meant to make me a vessel meet for His use. His own Calvary has blossomed into fertility; and so shall mine. Plenty out of pain, life out of death: is it not the law of the Kingdom? --In the Hour of Silence \n Do we call it dying when the bud bursts into flower? –Selected\n “Finding, following, keeping, struggling, Is He sure to bless? Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs, Answer, Yes.”\n 九月二十一日\n 「我……将万事当作有损的，因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。」（腓三8）\n 现在，正是五谷成熟的时期，农夫唱着欢乐的凯歌，把农产物收敛在仓廪里。但是，让我们想一想：如果不是有一粒麦子先死在地里的话，怎么能结出这么多的子粒来呢？属灵的事情也这样。我们自己的生命如果不死，怎么能活出基督的生命来呢？所以，让我们不再顾念我们自己的安乐和幸福。我们必须将自己的生命完全钉死在基督的十字架上－－不但将犯罪的欲望和习惯钉死，连天然生命中一切无罪的、美好的，也该一起钉死。因为如果我们要多结果子，就必须先被埋在黑暗和孤寂中。\n 亲爱的，恐怕你一定会像我一样━一听到这个消息，心中会感到非常失望。但是让我们记着：主竟看上了我们，要我们与祂一同受苦，在我们这岂不是一件极顶荣幸的事吗？并且，一切所遭遇的，无非要把我们造成合乎主用的器皿。痛苦生丰富，死亡生生命━这是神国中的定律。－－译自静默的时候\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5412.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
