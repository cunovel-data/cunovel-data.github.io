The time element in vision is essential. Our hearts are like a sensitive photographer\u0027s plate; and in order to have God revealed there, we must sit at His feet a long time. The troubled surface of a lake will not reflect an object. \\n\\n Our lives must be quiet and restful if we would see God. There is power in the sight of some things to affect one\u0027s life. A quiet sunset will bring peace to a troubled heart. Thus the vision of God always transforms human life. \\n\\n Jacob saw God at Jabbok\u0027s ford, and became Israel. The vision of God transformed Gideon from a coward into a valiant soldier. The vision of Christ changed Thomas from a doubting follower into a loyal, devout disciple.\\n\\n But men have had visions of God since Bible times. William Carey saw God, and left his shoemaker\u0027s bench and went to India. David Livingstone saw God, and left all to follow Him through the jungles of dark Africa. Scores and hundreds have had visions of God, and are today in the uttermost parts of the earth working for the speedy evangelization of the heathen. \\n\\n --Dr. Pardington \\n\\n There is hardly ever a complete silence in the soul. God is whispering to us well-nigh incessantly. Whenever the sounds of the world die out in the soul, or sink low, then we hear the whisperings of God. He is always whispering to us, only we do not hear, because of the noise, hurry, and distraction which life causes as it rushes on. --F. W. Faber \\n\\n “Speak, Lord, in the stillness,\\n\\n While I wait on Thee;\\n\\n Hushed my heart to listen\\n\\n In expectancy.”\\n\\n “Speak, 0 blessed Master,\\n\\n In this quiet hour;\\n\\n Let me see Thy face, Lord,\\n\\n Feel Thy touch of power.”\\n\\n “For the words Thou speakest,\\n\\n \u0027They are life, \u0027 indeed;\\n\\n Living bread from Heaven,\\n\\n Now my spirit feed!”\\n\\n “Speak, Thy servant heareth!\\n\\n Be not silent, Lord;\\n\\n Waits my soul upon Thee\\n\\n For the quickening word!”\\n\\n 九月十八日\\n\\n 「没有默示，民就放肆。」（箴廿九18）\\n\\n 要看见神，必须花功夫等候。时间在这里是一个主要的元素。我们必须在神的脚前静候多时，神纔会把祂自己显示在我们心里。一个波动的湖面是映不出甚么东西来的。所以，如果我们要看见神，我们必须先安息在神面前，把我们生活中的风波平静下来。\\n\\n 看见神是最有能力，最能影响我们生活的一回事。看见神常会叫人类的生活得到极大的转变。\\n\\n 雅各布在雅博渡口看见了神，就成了以色列。基甸看见了神，懦夫变成了勇士！多马看见了主，疑惑变成了忠实！\\n\\n 开雷看见了神，舍弃了鞋匠的生活到印度去。李文斯东看见了神，舍弃了一切跟随主，经历非洲的丛林。多少人都是因为看见了神；所以，今天在地极宣传福音，使人归向基督。－－巴亭登\\n\\n 灵里全然安静是一件非常不容易的事情。其实神一直在和我们讲话。甚么时候世界的声音在灵里消灭或低沉了，甚么时候我们就能听见神的声音。我们听不见，是因为我们生活中充满了喧闹、急躁和愁闷的缘故。\\n\\n －－费勃尔\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5409.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
