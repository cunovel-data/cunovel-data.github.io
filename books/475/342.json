{"id":15299,"no":342,"title":"December 8","content":"\"Put on as the elect of God, kindness\" (Col.3:12) \n There is a story of an old man who carried a little can of oil with him everywhere he went, and if he passed through a door that squeaked, he poured a little oil on the hinges. If a gate was hard to open, he oiled the latch. And thus he passed through life lubricating all hard places and making it easier for those who came after him.\n People called him eccentric, queer, and cranky; but the old man went steadily on refilling his can of oil when it became empty, and oiled the hard places he found.\n There are many lives that creak and grate harshly as they live day by day. Nothing goes right with them. They need lubricating with the oil of gladness, gentleness, or thoughtfulness. Have you your own can of oil with you? Be ready with your oil of helpfulness in the early morning to the one nearest you. It may lubricate the whole day for him. The oil, of good cheer to the downhearted one━Oh, how much it may mean! The word of courage to the despairing. Speak it.\n Our lives touch others but once, perhaps, on the road of life; and then, mayhap, our ways diverge, never to meet again, The oil of kindness has worn the sharp, hard edges off of many a sin-hardened life and left it soft and pliable and ready for the redeeming grace of the Saviour.\n A word spoken pleasantly is a large spot of sunshine on a sad heart. Therefore, \"Give others the sunshine, tell Jesus the rest.\"\n \"We cannot know the grief\n That men may borrow;\n We cannot see the souls\n Storm-swept by sorrow;\n But love can shine upon the way\n Today, tomorrow;\n Let us be kind.\n Upon the wheel of pain so many weary lives are broken,\n We live in vain who give no tender token.\n Let us be kind. \"\n \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love\" (Rom.12:10)\n ━Selected \n 十二月八日 \n 「你们既是神的选民…就要穿上怜悯、恩惠…」 （西三:12）\n 从前有一位老人，无论走到甚么地方，身边总带着一小瓶油的；如果他走过一扇门，门上发出辗轧的响声来，他就倒一些油在铰链上。如果他遇到一扇难开的门，他就涂一些油在门闩上。他一生就是这样做加油的工作，使他以后的人得着便利。 \n 人们称他为怪人；但是这位老人依然照旧行走━瓶里的油倒空了再装，倒空了再装…… \n 有许多人，他们每天的生活顶不和谐━充满轧轧声、咒骂声…他们需要喜乐油、温柔油、关切油…你身上有没有带着油呢？你应当随时带着你的帮助油━从早到晚去分给人━从你最近的人分起。也许你早晨分给他的油，可以够他一日应用。把喜乐油分给沮丧的人━对绝望的人说一句鼓励的话━哦，这是一件何等美丽的事。 \n 在人生的道路上，有许多人，我们也许一生只会碰到一次；以后永远不会再相遇了，所以千万不要错过这惟一的机会啊！多少次，一滴恩慈油，会叫一个顶硬的罪人软化过来。预备接受救主赎罪的恩典。\n 一句悦耳的话，对于一个忧伤的心，就是照明黑暗的阳光。 \n 我们不知道 \n 伤痛如何磨折着人们的心,\n 我们也不了解,\n 悲哀如何冲激着人们的灵； \n 唯有慈爱能天天照耀他们,\n 使他们得到一点光明,\n 我们要心存慈爱。\n 你看多少困倦的生命,\n 转辗于痛苦的车轮下,悲啼呻吟?\n 不能给人以同情的温暖,\n 人生还有甚么意义?\n 我们要行义存仁。 \n 「爱弟兄要彼此亲热。」（罗十二:10）━选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5577.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
