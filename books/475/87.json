{"id":15044,"no":87,"title":"March 28","content":"\"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap.\" (Joshua 3:13) \n \n Brave Levites! Who can help admiring them, to carry the Ark right into the stream; for the waters were not divided till their feet dipped in the water (ver. 15). God had not promised aught else. God honors faith. \"Obstinate faith,\" that the PROMISE sees and \"looks to that alone.\" You can fancy how the people would watch these holy men march on, and some of the bystanders would be saying, \"You would not catch me running that risk! Why, man, the ark will be carried away!\" Not so; \"the priests stood firm on dry ground.\" We must not overlook the fact that faith on our part helps God to carry out His plans. \"Come up to the help of the Lord.\" \n \n The Ark had staves for the shoulders. Even the Ark did not move of itself; it was carried. When God is the architect, men are the masons and laborers. Faith assists God. It can stop the mouth of lions and quench the violence of fire. It yet honors God, and God honors it. Oh, for this faith that will go on, leaving God to fulfill His promise when He sees fit! Fellow Levites, let us shoulder our load, and do not let us look as if we were carrying God\u0027s coffin. It is the Ark of the living God! Sing as you march towards the flood! --Thomas Champness. \n \n One of the special marks of the Holy Ghost in the Apostolic Church was the spirit of boldness. One of the most essential qualities of the faith that is to attempt great things for God, and expect great things from God, is holy audacity. Where we are dealing with a supernatural Being, and taking from Him things that are humanly impossible, it is easier to take much than little; it is easier to stand in a place of audacious trust than in a place of cautious, timid clinging to the shore. \n \n Like wise seamen in the life of faith, let us launch out into the deep, and find that all things are possible with God, and all things are possible unto him that believeth. \n \n Let us, today, attempt great things for God; take His faith and believe for them and His strength to accomplish them. --Days of Heaven upon Earth. \n \n 　 三月二十八日 \n \n 　　“等到抬普天下主耶和华约柜的祭司把脚站在约但河水里，约但河的水就是从上往下流的水，必然断绝立起成垒”(书三：13)。 \n \n 　　勇敢的利未人！谁能不佩服他们的胆量，抬了约柜伸脚到还未分开的水中去。神也一无其他的勉励和应许，只等待看他们的信心。神重视信心，尤其是不凭理由的信心，你可以推想当初许多百姓看见这些利未人抬了约柜下水，他们一定发急地说：“要是我，决不这样作无谓的牺牲！冒这样大的险！可惜，他们和约柜就要被约但河的急流冲去了！”可是，并不这样；“抬耶和华约柜的祭司在约但河中的干地上站定”(十七节)。我们不要小看信心，我们的信心能帮助神成功他的计划。 “……来帮助耶和华”(士五：23)。 \n \n 约柜有四根长杠，以便放到肩上扛抬，它本身不必行动，要有人去抬它。神有如建筑师，而人只是承造的匠人。信心能协助神，信心能叫神命令封住狮子的口，能叫神使火失其威势。信心尊重神，神也尊重信心。信心是永续的，让神认为适当的时候，实现神的应许。 \n \n 　　今天在恩典下同作利未人的哪，让我们凭着无理由的信心，抬起神的应许来，不要想我们抬的是神的棺材。这是永活之神的约柜呀！让我们一面唱歌，一面下水罢！——强卜奈斯 \n \n 　　勇敢的精神是使徒时代教会的特点。如果我们想为神做大事业，想从神得到大使命，我们必须有勇敢的信心。如果我们与超然的神接触，向他要人力所不能得到的东西，我告诉你：拿得多比拿得少还容易；大胆地站在应许上比胆怯地攀住海岸来得容易。 \n \n 　　在的生活中，让我们像聪明的水手一样，把船向深海驶去，你会发现在神凡事都能；在信的人也凡事都能。 \n \n 　　让我们今天来替神作大事业；相信他的能力是能完成一切的。——译自在地上的天上生活 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5023.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
