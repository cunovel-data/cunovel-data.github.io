{"id":15144,"no":187,"title":"July 6","content":"\"Neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon thee.\" (2 Chron. 20:12) A life was lost in Israel because a pair of human hands were laid unbidden upon the ark of God. They were placed upon it with the best intent, to steady it when trembling and shaking as the oxen drew it along the rough way; but they touched God\u0027s work presumptuously, and they fell paralyzed and lifeless. Much of the life of faith consists in letting things alone. If we wholly trust an interest to God, we must keep our hands off it; and He will guard it for us better than we can help Him. \"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.\"(Ps.37:7) Things may seem to be going all wrong, but He knows as well as we; and He will arise in the right moment if we are really trusting Him so fully as to let Him work in His own way and time. There is nothing so masterly as inactivity in some things, and there is nothing so hurtful as restless working, for God has undertaken to work His sovereign will. ━A.B. Simpson \"Being perplexed, I say, \u0027Lord, make it right! Night is as day to Thee, Darkness as light. I am afraid to touchThings that involve so much; My trembling hand may shake, My skilless hand may break; Thine can make no mistake.\u0027 \" \"Being in doubt I say, \u0027Lord, make it plain; Which is the true, safe way? Which would be gain? I am not wise to know, Nor sure of foot to go; What is so clear to Thee, Lord, make it clear to me!\u0027 \" It is such a comfort to drop the tangles of life into God\u0027s hands and leave them there. 七月六日 “我们也不知道怎样行，我们的眼目，单仰望你”（代下二十：12） 以色列人中因为未奉神命，轻易用人手去扶住约柜，以致遭了击杀。虽然他去扶的目的顶好━为着要按住约柜的震动━但是他的僭越使他丧失了生命。信心的生活是怎样的生活呢？就是自己一点不管，让神去负全责。 如果我们已经将一件事情完全交托了神，我们自己就不该再去顾问；全能的神莫非还需要我们的帮助吗？祂所作的莫非还不及我们吗？诗篇三十七篇七节说：“你当默然倚靠耶和华，耐性等候祂。不要因那道路通达的，和那恶谋成就的，心怀不平”。 也许你看见事情越过越糟了，但是我们旣知道，神那里会不知道呢？如果我们真心完全托付祂，让祂按照祂自己的方法和时间去成就，祂一定会在适当的时间起来的。在许多事情上，我们能完全不动，真是莫大的帮助；反之，如果我们自己仍不息地工作着，却是一个极大的阻碍。━宣信 当我感到迷惑烦恼，我说： “主，请你替我们把事情弄好！ 对于你，阴暗等于光明， 黑夜犹如白日杲杲。 我怕接触这些事情， 含有如许纠缠和骚扰， 我无力的手可能发抖， 你决不会错，准把事情弄好”。 当我感到疑惑不决，我说： “主，请你明白吩咐； 那一条路将有收获？ 那一条路安全无误？ 我的智慧看不清路途， 也没有把握举步， 主啊，你旣了如指掌， 也使我清楚，不会弄错”。 把一团乱麻的人生，交到神的手里，让祂去处理，岂不是无上的安慰。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5257.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
