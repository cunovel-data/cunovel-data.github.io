{"id":15006,"no":49,"title":"February 18","content":"\"Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.\" (Mark 11:24)\n When my little son was about ten years of age, his grandmother promised him a stamp album for Christmas. Christmas came, but no stamp album, and no word from grandmother. The matter, however, was not mentioned; but when his playmates came to see his Christmas presents, I was astonished, after he had named over this and that as gifts received, to hear him add,\n \"And a stamp album from grandmother.\"\n I had heard it several times, when I called him to me, and said, \"But, Georgie, you did not get an album from your grandmother. Why do you say so?\"\n There was a wondering look on his face, as if he thought it strange that I should ask such a question, and he replied, \"Well, mamma, grandma said, so it is the same as.\" I could not say a word to check his faith.\n A month went by, and nothing was heard from the album. Finally, one day, I said, to test his faith, and really wondering in my heart why the album had not been sent,\n \"Well, Georgie, I think grandma has forgotten her promise.\"\n \"Oh, no, mamma,\" he quickly and firmly said, \"she hasn\u0027t.\"\n I watched the dear, trusting face, which, for a while, looked very sober, as if debating the possibilities I had suggested. Finally a bright light passed over it, and he said,\n \"Mamma, do you think it would do any good if I should write to her thanking her for the album?\"\n \"I do not know,\" I said, \"but you might try it.\"\n A rich spiritual truth began to dawn upon me. In a few minutes a letter was prepared and committed to the mail, and he went off whistling his confidence in his grandma. In just a short time a letter came, saying:\n \"My dear Georgie: I have not forgotten my promise to you, of an album. I tried to get such a book as you desired, but could not get the sort you wanted; so I sent on to New York. It did not get here till after Christmas, and it was still not right, so I sent for another, and as it has not come as yet, I send you three dollars to get one in Chicago. Your loving grandma.\"\n As he read the letter, his face was the face of a victor. \"Now, mamma, didn\u0027t I tell you?\" came from the depths of a heart that never doubted, that, \"…against hope, believed in hope…\"(Rom.4:18) that the stamp album would come. While he was trusting, grandma was working, and in due season faith became sight.\n It is so human to want sight when we step out on the promises of God, but our Savior said to Thomas, and to the long roll of doubters who have ever since followed him: \"…Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.\"(Jn.20:29) ━Mrs. Rounds　\n 二月十八日\n “凡你们祷告祈求的，无论是甚么，只要信是得着的，就必得着” （可十一：24）\n 　　我有一个十岁的孩子，他的祖母应许给他一本邮票簿，作为圣诞礼物。可是过了许久，她并没有给他，也不再提起。这孩子也并不放在心上；可是，当他的同伴来看他的礼物时，他一件一件把收到的礼物拿出来给他们看了之后，总加上一句：\n 　　“祖母给我一本邮票簿。”\n 　　我听他说了好几次，很是希奇，所以我特地叫他到我面前来，问他说：“孩子，你并没有从你祖母那里得到一本邮票簿。你为甚么常对你的同伴这样说呢？”\n 　　他脸上起了诧异之色，似乎希奇我会发这样一个问题。他回答说：“妈妈，祖母旣应许了，这就等于我已经得着了。“我就不能再说甚么，免得伤他的信心。\n 　　一个月过去了，邮票簿仍是无着。一天，我要试试他的信心，就对他说：“孩子，我想祖母已经忘记了她的应许了”。\n 　　他很快，很坚持地说：“不，妈妈，她决不会忘记的”。\n 　　我望着那亲爱的，深信的小脸，看见他现在很正经的样子，好似要辩服我方纔所说的话一般。过了一会儿，他脸上现出了喜悦的光彩，说道：\n 　　“妈妈，你想我好不好现在写一封信去谢谢她的礼物呢？”\n 　　我说：“我不替你规定；可是，你可以试一试”。\n 　　（这时侯神用光照亮我，给我看见了一段丰富属灵的真理）。几分钟之内，他已把谢信写好寄出了，回来的时侯，嘴里还唱着欢乐的歌儿，证明他对祖母的信任。不久回信来了，里面写着：\n 　　“我所亲爱的乔琪：我并没有忘记我对你的应许━一本邮票簿。我想照你合意的样式去买，可是在本城买不到；所以我就到纽约城去函购。寄到了以后，一看，仍旧不对，所以我又到芝加哥去函购了。你所爱的祖母”。\n 　　他读完了信，脸上带着胜利的气概，对我说：“妈妈，我不是告述过你么？祖母旣应许了，这就等于我已经得着了”。他的心里，从来没有疑惑过，这就是“…在无可指望的时侯，因信仍有指望…”（罗四：18）。他深信邮票簿一定会来的。他信他的祖母进行，不久信心就变成了事实。\n 　　人们常要在神的应许上先有眼见，但是我们的主对多马说，也对那些跟从他而怀疑的人说：“…那没有看见就信的，有福了”（约二十：29）━朗滋夫人\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4864.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
