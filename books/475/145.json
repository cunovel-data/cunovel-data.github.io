{"id":15102,"no":145,"title":"May 25","content":"\"I endure all things for the sake of God\u0027s own people; so that they also may obtain salvation...and with it eternal glory.\" (2 Tim. 2:10) (Weymouth)\\n\\n If Job could have known as he sat there in the ashes, bruising his heart on this problem of Providence--that in the trouble that had come upon him he was doing what one man may do to work out the problem for the world, he might again have taken courage. No man lives to himself. Job\u0027s life is but your life and mine written in larger text….So, then, though we may not know what trials wait on any of us, we can believe that, as the days in which Job wrestled with his dark maladies are the only days that make him worth remembrance, and but for which his name had never been written in the book of life, so the days through which we struggle, finding no way, but never losing the light, will be the most significant we are called to live. --Robert Collyer.\\n\\n Who does not know that our most sorrowful days have been amongst our best? When the face is wreathed in smiles and we trip lightly over meadows bespangled with spring flowers, the heart is often running to waste.\\n\\n The soul which is always blithe and gay misses the deepest life. It has its reward, and it is satisfied to its measure, though that measure is a very scanty one. But the heart is dwarfed; and the nature, which is capable of the highest heights, the deepest depths, is undeveloped; and life presently burns down to its socket without having known the resonance of the deepest chords of joy.\\n\\n \"Blessed are they that mourn.\" Stars shine brightest in the long dark night of winter. The gentians show their fairest bloom amid almost inaccessible heights of snow and ice.\\n\\n God\u0027s promises seem to wait for the pressure of pain to trample out their richest juice as in a wine-press. Only those who have sorrowed know how tender is the \"Man of Sorrows.\" --Selected.\\n\\n Thou hast but little sunshine, but thy long glooms are wisely appointed thee; for perhaps a stretch of summer weather would have made thee as a parched land and barren wilderness. Thy Lord knows best, and He has the clouds and the sun at His disposal. --Selected.\\n\\n \"It is a gray day.\" \"Yes, but dinna ye see the patch of blue?\" --Scotch Shoemaker.\\n\\n 　 　 五月二十五日\\n\\n 　　“我为选民凡事忍耐，叫他们也可以得着……救恩，和永远的荣耀”（提后二：10）\\n\\n 　　当约伯坐在灰烬之中，假使他能知道神的旨意，究竟如何的时候，他所遭遇的磨难，正是给世人解答这回问题，他可能重新鼓起勇气来。没有人只为自己而活。约伯的生命，只是你我生命扩大的写照。我们虽不知道每一个人将遭遇到何种的试炼，但能相信，使约伯在苦痛疾病中挣扎着过那些日子，就是使他值得为后世之人怀念的日子。若不是那些日子，他的名字决不会写在圣经上。因此我们在奋斗前进，遭遇到这种阻挠，而从不灰心的这些日子，也将成为我们一生中最有意义的日子。\\n\\n 　　谁不知道我们最大的悲痛，是发生在最幸福的时候！当我们笑容满面，闲步于春花怒放的庭园时，我们的心常在此时颓唐下沉。\\n\\n 　　生活愉快逍遥的人，得不到最高属天的生命，他已有了酬报，而且满足于所得的酬报，却是他属灵生命长进的阻碍；使他本能意愿向最高最深之处的发展，亦因此而停滞了；他的生命还没有和最高贵的喜悦之音产生共鸣，就很快的耗为灰烬了。\\n\\n 　　“哀恸的人有福了；因为他们必得安慰”（太五：4）。星光照耀得最亮的时候，是在黑暗的冬夜。龙胆花开得最美丽的地方，是在冰雪的山顶。\\n\\n 　　神的应许，似乎要等待痛苦的压力，象酒坊中的压酢机那样，酢出最香烈的佳酿来。唯有经历悲哀的人，才知道耶稣是多么慈爱。\\n\\n 　　你虽只有一点点阳光，但对于你这长夜的阴暗是明智的安排。如果永远骄阳丽日的夏天，也许会把你晒成一片干枯不毛之地。你的主无所不知，云和太阳，都受他的使唤与调节。\\n\\n 　　“这是个阴天”“不错，但你难道没有看见也有补丁似的几片蔚蓝的天空吗”？\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5134.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
