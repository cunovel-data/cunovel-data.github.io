{"id":15086,"no":129,"title":"May 9","content":"\"Abraham stood yet before the Lord.\" (Gen. 18:22)\n The friend of God can plead with Him for others. Perhaps Abraham\u0027s height of faith and friendship seems beyond our little possibilities. Do not be discouraged, Abraham grew; so may we. He went step by step, not by great leaps.\n The man whose faith has been deeply tested and who has come off victorious, is the man to whom supreme tests must come.\n The finest jewels are most carefully cut and polished; the hottest fires try the most precious metal. Abraham would never have been called the Father of the Faithful if he had not been proved to the uttermost. Read Genesis, twenty-second chapter:\n \"Take thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest.\" See him going with a chastened, wistful, yet humbly obedient heart up Moriah\u0027s height, with the idol of his heart beside him about to be sacrificed at the command of God whom he had faithfully loved and served!\n What a rebuke to our questionings of God\u0027s dealings with us! Away with all doubting explanations of this stupendous scene! It was an object lesson for the ages. Angels were looking.\n Shall this man\u0027s faith stand forever for the strength and help of all God\u0027s people? Shall it be known through him that unfaltering faith will always prove the faithfulness of God?\n Yes; and when faith has borne victoriously its uttermost test, the angel of the Lord--who? The Lord Jesus, Jehovah, He in whom \"all the promises of God are yea and amen\"--spoke to him, saying, \"Now I know that thou fearest God.\" Thou hast trusted me to the uttermost. I will also trust thee; thou shalt ever be My friend, and I will bless thee, and make thee a blessing.\n It is always so, and always will be. \"They that are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.\" --Selected\n It is no small thing to be on terms of friendship with God.\n 　 五月九日\n “亚伯拉罕仍旧站在耶和华面前”（创十八：22）。\n 　　神的朋友可以为别人说情。也许我们以为亚伯拉罕的信心，同与神的友谊，是我们没有可能及到的。不要失望，亚伯拉罕是渐渐上进的；我们也可以渐渐上进的。我们追求，是跑步，不是跳远。\n 　　凡是信心经过许多试炼而得胜的人，这人必定有一个顶大的试炼等在前面。\n 　　无价的钻石都是曾经过切磋琢磨的；贵重的金属都是曾经过烈火试验的。亚伯拉罕决不能被称为信心之父，假使他未曾受过极大的试炼。请读创世记二十二章二节：\n 　　“你带着你的儿子，就是你独生的儿子，你所爱的”。看哪，他带着一个谦卑顺服的心，一步一步牵着他的心上人，向摩利亚山上走去，预备献给他所敬爱，事奉的神！\n 　　他这么作，给今天疑惑神的对付的人们何等大的责备！他这么作，惹起天使的注意。他这么作，坚固以后神的儿女的信心。他这么作，使信徒知道不犹豫的信心能证明神的信实。\n 　　当得胜的信心达到顶点的时候，耶和华的使者对他说：“现在我知道你是敬畏神的了”。你既信任我到极点，现在我也要信任你；你可以永远作我的朋友，我必祝福你，也必使你成为一个祝福。\n 　　这是一条不改变的原则：“那以信为本的人，和有信心的亚伯拉罕一同得福”（加三：9）。\n 　　与神作朋友不是一件小事。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5118.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
