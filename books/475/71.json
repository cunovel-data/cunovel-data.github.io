{"id":15028,"no":71,"title":"March 12","content":"\"The Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts....Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste....And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.\" (Exod. 10:13, 19) See how in the olden times, when the Lord fought for Israel against the cruel Pharaoh, the stormy winds wrought out their deliverance; and yet again, in that grandest display of power--the last blow that God struck at the proud defiance of Egypt. A strange, almost cruel thing it must have seemed to Israel to be hemmed in by such a host of dangers--in front the wild sea defying them, on either hand the rocky heights cutting off all hope of escape, the night of hurricane gathering over them. It was as if that first deliverance had come only to hand them over to more certain death. Completing the terror there rang out the cry: \"The Egyptians are upon us!\" When it seemed they were trapped for the foe, then came the glorious triumph. Forth swept the stormy wind and beat back the waves, and the hosts of Israel marched forward, down into the path of the great deep--a way arched over with God\u0027s protecting love. On either hand were the crystal walls glowing in the light of the glory of the Lord; and high above them swept the thunder of the storm. So on through all that night; and when, at dawn of the next day, the last of Israel\u0027s host set foot upon the other shore, the work of the stormy wind was done. Then sang Israel unto the Lord the song of the \"stormy wind fulfilling his word.\" \"The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil...Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.\" One day, by God\u0027s great mercy, we, too, shall stand upon the sea of glass, having the harps of God. Then we shall sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: \"Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.\" We shall know then how the stormy winds have wrought out our deliverance. Now you see only the mystery of this great sorrow; then you shall see how the threatening enemy was swept away in the wild night of fear and grief. Now you look only at the loss; then you shall see how it struck at the evil that had begun to rivet its fetters upon you. Now you shrink from the howling winds and muttering thunders; then you shall see how they beat back the waters of destruction, and opened up your way to the goodly land of promise.--Mark Guy Pearse. \"Though winds are wild; And the gale unleashed, My trusting heart still sings: I know that they mean No harm to me, He rideth on their wings.\" 　 三月十二日 “那一昼一夜，耶和华使东风刮在埃及地上，到了早晨，东风 把蝗虫刮了来。…于是法老急忙召了摩西亚伦来，…耶和华转了极大的西风，把蝗虫刮起，吹入红海，在埃及的四境连一个也没有留下” (出十：13，16，19)。 　　我们看神怎样利用暴风来拯救以色列人脱离残酷的法老；还有，神在表显他最大的神权时——神最后一次对付埃及的军队——也利用大东风(十四：21)。当时以色列人都以为他们的处境太危急，太残酷了——前面是红海，后面是追兵，两旁都是高耸的山岩，断绝了一切逃生的希望。以色列人在这时侯只能够仰望耶和华的拯救了。可是他的拯救是大东风。这真出他们意外。可怕的风声加增他们的惊慌，四周的寒冷冻得他们战栗。他们怨神的拯救无非催逼他们死得快一点。恐怕中那时他们全营的呼声是：“我们死啦！埃及人追及我们了”。 　　正在绝望的时侯，荣耀的胜利来了。吼声可怕的东风把浪击退，把海吹干，以色列人向前走去，进入神的保护和慈爱中。两旁是水晶的墙，前面是耶和华的荣光。终夜都是这样；到了天一亮，最后一个以色列人也上了岸，大东风的使命便完成了。 　　于是以色列人向耶和华唱歌说:“成就他命的狂风…都当赞美耶和华”(诗一四八：8，12)。 　　“仇敌说，我要追赶，我要追上，我要分掳物…你叫风一吹，海就把他们(埃及军兵)淹没，他们如铅沉在大水之中”(出十五：9/10) 。 　　到有一天，我们要站在玻璃海上，拿着神的琴；与众圣徒一同唱神仆人摩西的歌和羔羊的歌说：“众圣之王啊，你的方法义哉，诚哉”——(启十五：3直译)。——披尔斯 　　如今你只觉得大风暴的不可思议；将来你必看见威胁你的敌人，在战栗恐怖的夜里，歼灭净尽。 　　如今你只注意到损失；将来你必见到他为何打击那已经开始桎梏你的罪恶。 　　如今你因风啸雷鸣而畏缩；将来你必知道他如何击退那灭绝生命的洪水，为你们开辟道路，通往那应许的福地。——披尔斯 风虽猖狂奔放， 我的信心仍在歌唱。 我知道这不会伤害我， 神附在它的翅膀之上。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5007.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
