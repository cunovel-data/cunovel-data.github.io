{"id":15278,"no":321,"title":"November 17","content":"“Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily”(Luke 18:6-7) God\u0027s seasons are not at your beck. If the first stroke of the flint doth not bring forth the fire, you must strike again. God will hear prayer, but He may not answer it at the time which we in our minds have appointed; He will reveal Himself to our seeking hearts, but not just when and where we have settled in our own expectations. Hence the need of perseverance and importunity in supplication. In the days of flint and steel and brimstone matches we had to strike and strike again, dozens of times, before we could get a spark to live in the tinder; and we were thankful enough if we succeeded at last. Shall we not be as persevering and hopeful as to heavenly things? We have more certainty of success in this business than we had with our flint and steel, for we have God\u0027s promises at our back. Never let us despair. God\u0027s time for mercy will come; yea, it has come, if our time for believing has arrived. Ask in faith nothing wavering; but never cease from petitioning because the King delays to reply. Strike the steel again. Make the sparks fly and have your tinder ready; you will get a light before long.━C. H. Spurgeon I do not believe that there is such a thing in the history of God\u0027s kingdom as a right prayer offered in a right spirit that is forever left unanswered. ━Theodore L. Cuyler 十一月十七日 「你们听这不义之官所说的话。神的选民，昼夜呼吁他，他纵然为他们忍了多时，岂不终久给他伸冤么。我告诉你们，要快快的给他们伸冤了。」（路十八:6-7） 神的时候是不能听你指挥的。如果第一击不能叫燧石发出火来，你就当再击一次。神听了我们的祷告，不一定按照我们所指定的时候答应我们的；我们寻找祂，祂必向我们显现，不过不一定照我们所希望、所定规的时间和地点的。 在燧石时代，我们要想取得一火，必须一击再击，击数十次，纔能得到；只要能得到的话，就已经满心感激了。 对于属天的事情，我们为甚么不能这样坚忍呢？属天的事情比击石取火更有成工的把握，因为我们后面站着神的应许。 信徒阿，不要绝望！神赐怜悯的时候快到了。你当用不移的信心呼求；不要因为王的耽搁停止呼吁。再击一次燧石罢！这一次你就会得到了。━司布眞 我不相信在神国的历史中有这样的事情：用正当的灵所献上的正当的祷告永远不得着答应。━克勒","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5556.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
