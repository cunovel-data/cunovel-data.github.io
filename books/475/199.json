{"id":15156,"no":199,"title":"July 18","content":"\"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.\" (2Chron. 16:9.)\\n\\n GOD is looking for a man, or woman, whose heart will be always set on Him, and who will trust Him for all He desires to do. God is eager to work more mightily now than He ever has through any soul. The clock of the centuries points to the eleventh hour. \\n\\n \"The world is waiting yet to see what God can do through a consecrated soul.\" Not the world alone, but God Himself is waiting for one, who will be more fully devoted to Him than any who have ever lived; who will be willing to be nothing that Christ may be all; who will grasp God\u0027s own purposes; and taking His humility and His faith, His love and His power, will, without hindering, continue to let God do exploits. --- C. H. P. \\n\\n \"There is no limit to what God can do with a man, providing he will not touch the glory.\" \\n\\n In an address given to ministers and workers after his ninetieth birthday, George Mueller spoke thus of himself: \"I was converted in November, 1825, but I only came into the full surrender of the four years later, in July, 1829. The love of money was gone, the love of place was gone, the love of position was gone, the love of worldly pleasures and engagements was gone. God, God alone became my portion. I found my all in Him; I wanted nothing else. \\n\\n And by the grace of God this has remained, and has made me a happy man, an exceedingly happy man, and it led me to care only about the things of God. \\n\\n I ask affectionately, my beloved brethren, have you fully surrendered the heart to God, or is there this thing or that thing with which you are taken up irrespective of God? I read a little of the Scriptures before, but preferred other books; but since that time the revelation He has made of Himself has become unspeakably blessed to me, and I can say from my heart, God is an infinitely lovely Being. \\n\\n Oh, be not satisfied until in your own inmost soul you can say, God is an infinitely lovely Being!\" --- Selected. 　\\n\\n 七月十八日\\n\\n 「耶和华的眼目遍察全地。」（历代志下十六:9）\\n\\n 　亲爱的读者阿，神正在寻找一个人━一个肯全心倾向祂的人，一个肯完全顺服他的人。神切望在这人身上动一件重要的工程━祂要重用祝福这人，比以前灵界上的一切伟人更甚；因为这世代的钟已经走到午夜十一点了。 \\n\\n 　　世界在等待━要看神借着一个献身的圣徒能成功何等大的事！不独世界，就是神自己也在等待一个人出来━一个肯完全献身于祂比一切先圣更甚的人；一个愿意把一切视为粪土、看基督是一切的人；一个能体会神心意的人；一个有主的谦卑、主的信心、主的爱、主的能力，而不肯阻止神的计划，一直让神借着他工作的人。── C.H.P. \\n\\n 　　一个被神重用的人，只要不偷享神的荣耀，神在他身上的祝福是无限量的。 \\n\\n 　　穆勒在九十岁那年，对一班教师和工人所发表的一篇演说里面，有一段讲到他自己的见证说：「我是在一八二五年十一月里得救的，但是一直到四年以后，一八二九年七月里才完全顺服。那时候，爱钱财的心没有了，爱都市的心没有了，爱地位的心没有了，爱属世的娱乐的心也没有了。神，惟有神，是我所爱的。我在祂里面找到了一切，所以我不再需要其它的东西了。」 \\n\\n 　　「感谢神，靠着祂的恩典，这倾向一直存留到今天，使我终身得成一个快乐的人━一个极其快乐的人；这倾向也叫我只爱慕属天的事物。」 \\n\\n 　　「现在，我亲爱的弟兄们啊，让我诚诚恳恳地问你们一句话，你们有没有完全顺服神呢？你们所作的是不是还有这件或者那件没有顾到神的心呢？我以前只读一点点圣经，我宁愿多读些别的书籍；但是自从那时候起，神的话对于我便成了说不尽的福乐，我能够从心坎中发出喊声来说，神真可爱极了。」 \\n\\n 　　「弟兄们啊，你们不要自满自足，我真希望在你们心的最深处也能够喊叫说，神真可爱极了！」 ── 选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5269.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
