{"id":15038,"no":81,"title":"March 22","content":"\"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush…saying…I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.\" (Acts 7:30, 32, 34) \n \n That was a long wait in preparation for a great mission. When God delays, He is not inactive. He is getting ready His instruments, He is ripening our powers; and at the appointed moment we shall arise equal to our task. Even Jesus of Nazareth was thirty years in privacy, growing in wisdom before He began His work. --Dr. Jowett. \n \n God is never in a hurry but spends years with those He expects to greatly use. He never thinks the days of preparation too long or too dull. \n \n The hardest ingredient in suffering is often time. A short, sharp pang is easily borne, but when a sorrow drags its weary way through long, monotonous years, and day after day returns with the same dull routine of hopeless agony, the heart loses its strength, and without the grace of God, is sure to sink into the very sullenness of despair. Joseph\u0027s was a long trial, and God often has to burn His lessons into the depths of our being by the fires of protracted pain. \"He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,\" but He knows how long, and like a true goldsmith He stops the fires the moment He sees His image in the glowing metal. We may not see now the outcome of the beautiful plan which God is hiding in the shadow of His hand; it yet may be long concealed; but faith may be sure that He is sitting on the throne, calmly waiting the hour when, with adoring rapture, we shall say, \"All things have worked together for good.\" Like Joseph, let us be more careful to learn all the lessons in the school of sorrow than we are anxious for the hour of deliverance. There is a \"need-be\" for every lesson, and when we are ready, our deliverance will surely come, and we shall find that we could not have stood in our place of higher service without the very things that were taught us in the ordeal. God is educating us for the future, for higher service and nobler blessings; and if we have the qualities that fit us for a throne, nothing can keep us from it when God\u0027s time has come. Don\u0027t steal tomorrow out of God\u0027s hands. Give God time to speak to you and reveal His will. He is never too late; learn to wait. –Selected。 \n \n \"He never comes too late; He knoweth what is best; \n \n Vex not thyself in vain; until He cometh--REST.\" \n \n Do not run impetuously before the Lord; learn to wait His time: the minute-hand as well as the hour-hand must point the exact moment for action. \n \n 　 三月二十二日 \n \n “过了四十年，在西乃山的旷野，有一位天使，从荆棘火焰中，向摩西显现…说:我下来要救他们，你来，我要差你往埃及去” (徒七：30，31，34) \n \n 　　接受一个重大使命之前，需要何等长的等候和预备！神若延迟，并不是遗忘。他是在预备他的器皿，给他们相当的训练和教育；到了神所指定的时侯，神要兴起他们来背负他们的工作。就是拿撒勒人耶稣，也必须有叁十年的准备，直等他的智慧和身量，并神和人喜爱他的心长完全了，才开始他的工作。——乔怀德 \n \n 　　神从不性急，他肯花长时期去预备他要重用的器皿。他从不以为预备的日子太长了，或是太无聊了。 \n \n 　　在苦难中最难受的成分常是时间。短而急的痛苦易受，长而慢的痛苦难当。有时侯我们的痛苦缠绵数年；一天一天过去，并没有得着轻减；那时侯我们的力量就会失去；如果没有神的恩典，我们定规会沉入绝境。约瑟的试炼是一个长时期的，到了时侯，他成了何等样人！神常藉着火把他的功课，煎熬在我们的最深处。“他必坐下如炼净银子的”(玛三：3)，他知道该炼多少时侯；像银匠一般，他一看见银子炼得能照见他的形象时，便立即把火停止。现在我们虽然看不见神的美意，也看不见将来荣耀的结果；但是信心知道神是不会错误的，他叫“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处”(罗八：28)。让我们像约瑟一样，在神苦难的学校中用心学习一切的功课，少盼望立时的拯救。每一课功课都是必需的；我们学会了，拯救自然会来的；那时侯我们就要看见：如果没有在试炼中受过教育，我们决不能站在更大的工场上担任更重要的工作。所以，亲爱的，神现在训练我们，是为着我们的将来——将来更大的事奉和更多的祝福；——如果我们有资格可以坐宝座了，神的拯救就来了，那时侯没有东西再能拦阻我们。但愿我们不去夺神手中的明天。给神充分的时间来栽培我们。他决不会来得太迟的；学习耐心等候罢。——选 \n \n 　　他决不会来得太迟，他在作最好的安排；不要空寻烦恼，安心等候他的来到。 \n \n 　　不要很性急地跑在神前面；学习等候他的时间：钟表上的分针和时针走起来都有一定的规律。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5017.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
