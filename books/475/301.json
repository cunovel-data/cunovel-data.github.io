{"id":15258,"no":301,"title":"October 28","content":"\"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ… and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus\" (Eph. 2:4-6) This is our rightful place, to be \"seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,\" and to \"sit still\" there. But how few there are who make it their actual experience! How few, indeed think even that it is possible for them to \"sit still\" in these \"heavenly places\" in the everyday life of a world so full of turmoil as this. We may believe perhaps that to pay a little visit to these heavenly places on Sundays, or now and then in times of spiritual exaltation, may be within the range of possibility; but to be actually \"seated\" there every day and all day long is altogether another matter; and yet it is very plain that it is for Sundays and week-days as well. A quiet spirit is of inestimable value in carrying on outward activities; and nothing so hinders the working of the hidden spiritual forces, upon which, after all, our success in everything really depends, as a spirit of unrest and anxiety. There is immense power in stillness. A great saint once said, \"All things come to him who knows how to trust and be silent.\" The words are pregnant with meaning. A knowledge of this fact would immensely change our ways of working. Instead of restless struggles, we would \"sit down\" inwardly before the Lord, and would let the Divine forces of His Spirit work out in silence the ends to which we aspire. You may not see or feel the operations of this silent force, but be assured it is always working mightily, and will work for you, if you only get your spirit still enough to be carried along by the currents of its power. ━Hannah Whitall Smith \"There is a point of rest At the great center of the cyclone\u0027s force, A silence at its secret source; A little child might slumber undisturbed, Without the ruffle of one fair curl, In that strange, central calm, amid the mighty whirl. \" It is your business to learn to be peaceful and safe in God in every situation. 十月二十八日 「然而神既有丰富的怜悯，因祂爱我们的大爱，当我们死在过犯中的时候，便叫我们与基督一同活过来。….祂又叫我们与基督耶稣一同复活，一同坐在天上。」 （弗二:4-6） 「与基督耶稣一同坐在天上」━安安静静地坐着━是我们的权利，是我们的本分。但是有几个人眞有这样的经历呢？有几个人眞想这是一件可能的事呢？ 我们也许会想：恐怕在主日，或者灵程猛进的时候，偶然能有这样的经历；如果每天随时都坐在天上，是不可能的事罢！但是我告诉你：主日能，周日也能，天天都能！ 一个安静的灵，对于外面的活动是非常有帮助的；反言之，没有一件东西，比灵里的焦急挂虑，更妨碍属灵的能力和成功。 一位属灵的信徒有一次告诉我们：「知道怎样信靠，怎样安静，就是得到了一切。」这句话是非常有意思的。我们如果知道这个，我们工作的方法就会大大改变了。我们不会再不息地挣扎了；我们会安安静静地坐在主面前，让圣灵去替我们完成我们所希望的。我们也许看不见、感不到，圣灵在替我们工作，但是我们应当相信：祂一直在很出力地替我们做啊！我们只要把我们灵安静下来好了。━司密斯 有一个宁静的处所， 在大旋风的中央， 风卷着它疯狂旋转， 这中心出奇地安详, 如果有小孩在那里酣睡， 连发丝都不会飘扬。 我们应当在任何环境中学习享受神的平安。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5536.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
