{"id":15165,"no":208,"title":"July 27","content":"\"Prove me now.\" (Mal. 3:10.) \n WHAT is God saying here but this: \"My child, I still have windows in Heaven. They are yet in service. The bolts slide as easily as of old. The hinges have not grown rusty. I would rather fling them open, and pour forth, than keep them shut, and hold back. I opened them for Moses, and the sea parted. I opened them for Joshua, and Jordan rolled back. I opened them for Gideon, and hosts fled. I will open them for you─if you will only let Me. On this side of the windows, Heaven is the same rich storehouse as of old. The fountains and streams still overflow. The treasure rooms are still bursting with gifts. \n The lack is not on my side. It is on yours. I am waiting. Prove Me now. Fulfill the conditions, on your part. Bring in the tithes. Give Me a chance. --- Selected. \n I can never forget my mother\u0027s very brief paraphrase of Malachi 3:10. The verse begins, \"Bring ye the whole tithe in,\" and it ends up with \"I will pour\" the blessing out till you\u0027ll be embarrassed for space. Her paraphrase was this: Give all He asks; take all He promises.\" --- S. D. Gordon. \n The ability of God is beyond our prayers, beyond our largest prayers! I have been thinking of some of the petitions that have entered into my supplication innumerable times. What have I asked for? I have asked for a cupful, and the ocean remains! I have asked for a sunbeam, and the sun abides! My best asking falls immeasurably short of my Father\u0027s giving: it is beyond that we can ask.---J.H. Jowett. \n \"All the rivers of Thy grace I claim. Over every promise write my name.\" \n 七月二十七日\n 「你们要将当纳的十分之一，全然送入仓库....以此试试我，是否为你们敞开天上的窗户，倾福与你们，甚至无处可容。」（玛三:10） \n 　　亲爱的读者，神在这里对我们说：「我的孩子，天上的窗户和从前一点没有两样，窗闩和从前一样光滑，铁钮也一点没有生锈。这窗户我曾为摩西敞开，红海分开了。我曾为乔舒亚敞开，约但河停住了。我曾为基甸敞开，敌军逃跑了。现在我也愿意为你敞开━只要你肯让我这样作。在我这一面，天仍旧是一个丰富的仓库，泉源仍旧是满溢的，宝藏室仍旧满贮着礼物。」 \n 　　「所有的缺乏不是在我，乃是在你。但是我现在还在等候。试试我看！你去履行你方面的条件━将当纳的十分之一，全然送入仓库━其余的事情便是我的了。孩子，给我一个机会━给我一个倾福与你的机会！」──选 \n 　　我永远不会忘却我母亲所说的两句话：给一切神所要求的，取一切神所允许的。──戈登 \n 　　神的能力真是远超过我们所祷告的！我今天回想一想我多次在神前的请求━我所请求的是什么？我所请求的不过是一小杯水，海洋却依然留着！我所请求的不过是一线日光，日头却依然在着！我所求的和父所给的相差得多远啊━父所给的真是远超过我所求的！── 乔怀德\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5278.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
