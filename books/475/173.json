Not long ago I read in a paper a bit of personal experience from a precious child of God, and it made such an impression upon me that I record it here. She wrote:\\n\\n \"I found myself one midnight wholly sleepless as the surges of a cruel injustice swept over me, and the love which covers seemed to have crept out of my heart. Then I cried to God in an agony for the power to obey His injunction, \u0027Love covereth.\u0027\\n\\n \"Immediately the Spirit began to work in me the power that brought about the forgetfulness.\\n\\n \"Mentally I dug a grave. Deliberately I threw up the earth until the excavation was deep.\\n\\n \"Sorrowfully I lowered into it the thing which wounded me. Quickly I shoveled in the clods.\\n\\n \"Over the mound I carefully laid the green sods. Then I covered it with white roses and forget-me-nots, and quickly walked away.\\n\\n \"Sweet sleep came. The wound which had been so nearly deadly was healed without a scar, and I know not today what caused my grief.\"\\n\\n \"There was a scar on yonder mountain-side,\\n\\n Gashed out where once the cruel storm had trod;\\n\\n A barren, desolate chasm, reaching wide\\n\\n Across the soft green sod.\\n\\n \"But years crept by beneath the purple pines,\\n\\n And veiled the scar with grass and moss once more,\\n\\n And left it fairer now with flowers and vines\\n\\n Than it had been before.\\n\\n \"There was a wound once in a gentle heart,\\n\\n Whence all life\u0027s sweetness seemed to ebb and die;\\n\\n And love\u0027s confiding changed to bitter smart,\\n\\n While slow, sad years went by.\\n\\n \"Yet as they passed, unseen an angel stole\\n\\n And laid a balm of healing on the pain,\\n\\n Till love grew purer in the heart made whole,\\n\\n And peace came back again.\"\\n\\n 　 六月二十二日\\n\\n “爱，能遮掩一切过错”（箴十：12）。\\n\\n 　　前几天我在报纸上看到一个神的孩子的一些个人经历。这些经历在我的脑海中留下了深深的印象，所以我特地将它记在这里。她说：\\n\\n 　　“一天夜半我想起了一件痛苦不平的事情，叫我翻来覆去地再也不能睡熟；爱心似乎已经偷偷地从我心中逃了出去。于是我拼命向神呼求能力，叫我能服从他的命令：“爱能遮掩一切过错”。\\n\\n 　　“圣灵立刻在我里面开始工作，给我能力忘却一切。\\n\\n 　　起初，我在脑海中掘开了一个坟墓。从从容容地将泥土挖开，直到挖成了一个极深的孔穴。\\n\\n 　　我悲悲哀哀地尽往下挖那件曾使我受伤的东西。很快地将泥土一铲一铲地铲起来。\\n\\n 　　可是后来，我却谨谨慎慎地将绿色的草土铺在土墩上面。再用白玫瑰花和勿忘侬花（forget-me-not ——花名）将他覆盖，很快地跑开了。\\n\\n 　　甜蜜的睡眠来了，那几乎致命的创伤，竟被医愈得一无瘢痕；到今天我连想也想不起来：到底是什么东西，曾使我那样悲哀”。——选\\n\\n 远处山边有一道裂痕，\\n\\n 那是被雷电所摧残的地方，\\n\\n 这个荒芜不毛的陷坑，\\n\\n 割裂了绿色的山岗。\\n\\n 裂痕在树荫下过了好些年，\\n\\n 又重盖满了青草和苔藓，\\n\\n 点缀着野花和葡萄藤，\\n\\n 比以前更显得美观。\\n\\n 温柔的心也有一个创伤，\\n\\n 生命的甜蜜因此全消亡，\\n\\n 爱的信心变成刺骨的剧痛，\\n\\n 在岁月消逝中，折磨备尝。\\n\\n 不知不觉中有位天使，\\n\\n 用药膏把那创痛医好，\\n\\n 爱的信心长得更为纯洁，\\n\\n 平安重新代替了烦恼。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5176.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
