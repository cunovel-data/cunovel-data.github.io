{"id":15074,"no":117,"title":"April 27","content":"\"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.\" (Rev1:18)\\n\\n Flowers! Easter lilies! speak to me this morning the same dear old lesson of immortality which you have been speaking to so many sorrowing souls.\\n\\n Wise old Book! let me read again in your pages of firm assurance that to die is gain.\\n\\n Poets! recite to me your verses which repeat in every line the Gospel of eternal life.\\n\\n Singers! break forth once more into songs of joy; let me hear again the well-known resurrection psalms.\\n\\n Tree and blossom and bird and sea and sky and wind whisper it, sound it afresh, warble it, echo it, let it throb and pulsate through every atom and particle; let the air be filled with it.\\n\\n Let it be told and retold and still retold until hope rises to conviction, and conviction to certitude of knowledge; until we, like Paul, even though going to our death, go with triumphant mien, with assured faith, and with serene and shining face.\\n\\n O sad-faced mourners, who each day are wending\\n\\n Through churchyard paths of cypress and of yew,\\n\\n Leave for today the low graves you are tending,\\n\\n And lift your eyes to God\u0027s eternal blue!\\n\\n It is no time for bitterness or sadness;\\n\\n Twine Easter lilies, not pale asphodels;\\n\\n Let your souls thrill to the caress of gladness,\\n\\n And answer the sweet chime of Easter bells.\\n\\n If Christ were still within the grave\u0027s low prison,\\n\\n A captive of the enemy we dread;\\n\\n If from that moldering cell He had not risen,\\n\\n Who then could chide the gloomy tears you shed?\\n\\n If Christ were dead there would be need to sorrow,\\n\\n But He has risen and vanquished death for aye;\\n\\n Hush, then your sighs, if only till the morrow,\\n\\n At Easter give your grief a holiday.\\n\\n --May Riley Smith.\\n\\n A well-known minister was in his study writing an Easter sermon when the thought gripped him that his Lord was living. He jumped up excitedly and paced the floor repeating to himself, \"Why Christ is alive, His ashes are warm, He is not the great \u0027I was,\u0027 He is the great \u0027I am.\u0027\" He is not only a fact, but a living fact. Glorious truth of Easter Day!\\n\\n We believe that out of every grave there blooms an Easter lily, and in every tomb there sits an angel. We believe in a risen Lord. Turn not your faces to the past that we may worship only at His grave, but above and within that we may worship the Christ that lives. And because He lives, we shall live also. --Abbott.\\n\\n 　 四月二十七日\\n\\n “我是那存活的，我曾死过，现在又活了，直活到永永远远”（启一：18）\\n\\n 　　复活节的百合花！请把那关于永生的古老教训，讲给我听，这是你讲给许多悲哀的人们听过的。\\n\\n 　　代表智慧的古老圣经，请我们再翻阅你的这些记载，确证“死即是得生”。\\n\\n 　　诗人哪！把你充满永生福音的诗句念给我听。\\n\\n 　　歌手哪！再唱一遍欢乐的颂赞，让我再倾听那刻骨铭心的复活颂。\\n\\n 　　树木，花草，禽鸟，海洋，风和天籁，请你们都轻轻吹奏这歌曲，以清新的音调，婉转的乐章，使世上一切的物质，都受到它的震动和鼓荡，让它充满在宇宙之中。\\n\\n 　　让它一遍又一遍地传进世人的耳中，直到希望成为信心，信念变成确知；直到我们象保罗那样，即使走向死亡，也能带着胜利的雄壮，坚定的信心，沉着而明亮的容光。\\n\\n 哀恸的人，你每天徘徊于\\n\\n 松柏夹道的墓地，心碎神伤，\\n\\n 今天该离开你凭吊的坟场，\\n\\n 举目仰望神的蓝色天堂。\\n\\n 做一串复活节的百合花环，\\n\\n 用不着幽兰的芬芳，\\n\\n 现今不是痛苦悲哀的日子，\\n\\n 要喜悦响应那甜美的复活钟声。\\n\\n 假若基督仍在坟墓的监狱，\\n\\n 当俘虏且受制于死敌魔君；\\n\\n 假若他未曾从朽腐的洞穴复活，\\n\\n 谁能呵责你流下忧伤的泪滴。\\n\\n 假若基督真是死了那就该悲伤，\\n\\n 但他已经复活，而且永远战胜死亡；\\n\\n 停止你的长叹，你应破涕为笑，\\n\\n 在复活节，要把悲痛遗忘。 ——司密斯\\n\\n 　　一位名传道人在屋里撰写复活节的讲道稿，他突然为一个思想所感动；他的主是活着的，他兴奋地跳了起来，在屋里踱来踱去，一遍又一遍地对自己说：“基督是活着的，他那温暖的身体，不仅过去是伟大的，而现在仍旧是伟大”。他不但是一个事实，而且是活的事实。这就是复活节光荣的真理。\\n\\n 　　我们相信每一个墓穴都开出一朵复活节的百合花；每个墓穴里坐着一位天使，我们是信仰复活的主，不要面对过去，以免我们崇拜坟墓，而要转向上方，以心灵诚实来崇拜活着的基督，因为他活着，我们也必活着。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5053.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
