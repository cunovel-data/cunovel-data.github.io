{"id":15090,"no":133,"title":"May 13","content":"\"We know not what we should pray for as we ought.\" (Rom. 8:26) Much that perplexes us in our Christian experience is but the answer to our prayers. We pray for patience, and our Father sends those who tax us to the utmost; for \"tribulation worketh patience.\" We pray for submission, and God sends sufferings; for \"we learn obedience by the things we suffer.\" We pray for unselfishness, and God gives us opportunities to sacrifice ourselves by thinking on the things of others, and by laying down our lives for the brethren. We pray for strength and humility, and some messenger of Satan torments us until we lie in the dust crying for its removal. We pray, \"Lord, increase our faith,\" and money takes wings; or the children are alarmingly ill; or a servant comes who is careless, extravagant, untidy or slow, or some hitherto unknown trial calls for an increase of faith along a line where we have not needed to exercise much faith before. We pray for the Lamb-life, and are given a portion of lowly service, or we are injured and must seek no redress; for \"he was led as a lamb to the slaughter and … opened not his mouth.\" We pray for gentleness, and there comes a perfect storm of temptation to harshness and irritability. We pray for quietness, and every nerve is strung to the utmost tension, so that looking to Him we may learn that when He giveth quietness, no one can make trouble. We pray for love, and God sends peculiar suffering and puts us with apparently unlovely people, and lets them say things which rasp the nerves and lacerate the heart; for love suffereth long and is kind, love is not impolite, love is not provoked. LOVE BEARETH ALL THINGS, believeth, hopeth and endureth, love never faileth. We pray for likeness to Jesus, and the answer is, \"I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.\" \"Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong?\" \"Are ye able?\" The way to peace and victory is to accept every circumstance, every trial, straight from the hand of a loving Father; and to live up in the heavenly places, above the clouds, in the very presence of the Throne, and to look down from the Glory upon our environment as lovingly and divinely appointed. –Selected. I prayed for strength, and then I lost awhile All sense of nearness, human and divine; The love I leaned on failed and pierced my heart, The hands I clung to loosed themselves from mine; But while I swayed, weak, trembling, and alone, The everlasting arms upheld my own. I prayed for light; the sun went down in clouds, The moon was darkened by a misty doubt, The stars of heaven were dimmed by earthly fears, And all my little candle flames burned out; But while I sat in shadow, wrapped in night, The face of Christ made all the darkness bright. I prayed for peace, and dreamed of restful ease, A slumber drugged from pain, a hushed repose; Above my head the skies were black with storm, And fiercer grew the onslaught of my foes; But while the battle raged, and wild winds blew, I heard His voice and perfect peace I knew. I thank Thee, Lord, Thou wert too wise to heed My feeble prayers, and answer as I sought, Since these rich gifts Thy bounty has bestowed Have brought me more than all I asked or thought; Giver of good, so answer each request With Thine own giving, better than my best. --Annie Johnson Flint 　 　 五月十三日 “我们本不晓得怎样祷告”（罗八：26）。 神给我们的祷告的答应，常出我们意外。我们求忍耐，神却给我们患难；因为“患难生忍耐”（罗五:3）。 　我们求顺服，神却给我们苦难，好使我们“因所受的苦难学了顺从”（来五：8）。 　　我们求不利己，神却给我们牺牲自己的机会，想念别人，为弟兄舍命。 　　我们求能力和谦卑，神却给我们撒但的苦害。直到我们躺在尘土里求告他。 　　我们“求主加增我们的信心”（路十七：5），神却使我们伤财，害病，失业，遭难，逼我们比以前更运用信心。 　　我们求羔羊的生命，神却给我们最低微的职业，使我们受逼迫，因为“他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地…不开口“（赛五十三：7）。 　　我们求温柔，神却给我们许多惹厌和激怒的东西。我们求安静，神却使我们每一根神经都紧张起来了，好叫我们到他那里去寻求安息。 　　我们求爱心，神却放我们在最不可爱的人中，让他们刺激我们的神经，刺伤我们的赤心；因为爱是恒久忍耐，又有恩慈，爱是不求自己的益处，爱是不轻易发怒。爱是凡事包容，凡事相信，凡事盼望，凡事忍耐。爱是永不止息。 　　得胜和得安息的方法，就是直接从爱父的手中接受他所给你的每一个环境，每一个试炼；而享受其中互相效力的益处。——选 我祈求的力量却丧失了一段时间， 就是与神之间亲密的联系， 我所倚靠的爱，使我失望，伤透了心， 我所攀住的手好像松开，把我抛弃， 可是当我摇晃软弱颤抖孤独的时候， 神立刻援手，把我挽住，免我颠蹶。 我祈求的光明，但太阳没入了云层， 怀疑的雾，遮掩了月亮的光明， 尘世的忧虑，蒙蔽了天上的星星， 我微弱的烛焰将告熄灭； 正当被黑暗所包围的时候， 基督圣荣的光辉，消散一切幽冥。 我祈求和平，也梦想恬静， 如疼痛后的沉睡甜息安宁； 忽然狂风暴雨从天边袭来， 敌人的攻击，更见可怕狰狞； 正当战争激烈，狂风怒号之时， 我听见他的声音，就知美满和平。 我卑微的祷告，渺小的祈求， 在全智的主，原可不值得垂听， 可是我感谢你所赐的丰盛， 超过了我的想象与希望， 赐恩的主，你对于每一个祈求， 必以恩典来答复我们的翘首。 ——富林德","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5122.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
