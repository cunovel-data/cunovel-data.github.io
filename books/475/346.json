{"id":15303,"no":346,"title":"December 12","content":"\"The last drops of my sacrifice are falling; my time to go has come. I have fought in the good fight; I have kept the faith\" (2 Tim.4:6-7)\n As soldiers show their scars and talk of battles when they come at last to spend their old age in the country at home, so shall we in the dear land to which we are hastening, speak of the goodness and faithfulness of God who brought us through all the trials of the way. I would not like to stand in the white-robed host and hear it said, \"These are they that came out of great tribulation, all except one.\"\n Would you like to be there and see yourself pointed at as the one saint who never knew a sorrow? Oh, no! for you would be an alien in the midst of the sacred brotherhood. We will be content to share the battle, for we shall soon wear the crown and wave the palm. ━C. H. Spurgeon\n \"Where were you wounded?\" asked the surgeon of a soldier at Lookout Mountain. \"Almost at the top,\" he answered. He forgot even his gaping wound━he only remembered that he had won the heights. So let us go forth to higher endeavors for Christ and never rest till we can shout from the very top, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.\"\n \"Finish thy work, then rest,\n Till then rest never;\n The rest for thee by God,\n Is rest forever. \"\n \"God will not look you over for medals, degrees or diplomas but for scars.\"\n Of an old hero the minstrel sang━ \n “With his Yemen sword for aid;\n Ornament it carried none,\n But the notches on the blade.”\n What nobler decoration of honor can any godly man seek after than his scars of service, his losses for the crown, his reproaches for Christ\u0027s sake, his being worn out in his Master\u0027s service! ━Selected\n 十二月十二日 \n 「我离世的时候到了。那美好的仗我已经打过了,当跑的路我已经跑尽了,所信的道我已经守住了。」 \n （提后四:6-7）\n 军人到了年老退休在家的时候，最喜欢谈讲战场上的经历，也最喜欢把他们的伤痕指给人看；我们也是这样，当我们到了天家的时候，一定耶最喜欢述说神的良善、神的信实、神怎养带领我们经过路上一切的试炼。我们喜不喜欢站在穿白衣的中间，听见说：「这些人━除了一个━都是从大患难中出来的」呢？ \n 你喜不喜欢在那里有人这样指着你说呢？一定不罢！今天我们能有分于患难，已经可以叫我们知足了；因为不久我们就要头戴冠冕、手拿棕树枝了。━司布眞\n 有一个军人，攀登洛考得山受了伤，医生问他说：“你是在什么地方受伤的”？他答道：“我记不清楚了，大概在山顶附近。”他只记得他攀登了山顶，连如何受伤也记不在心上。愿我们也以同样的精神为基督作更崇高的努力，直等到我们抵达山顶，可以高声喊说：“我已完成了我们的奋斗，跑完了我的路，保持了我的信心。” \n 到任务完毕之后再休息,\n 决不中途停竭;\n 神所赐给你的,\n 才是永恒的休息。 \n 神不会到你身上找奖章、学位、文凭；祂却会去找伤痕。\n 古代吟唱诗人歌颂一位英雄说:\n 「他所佩的宝刀,一无装饰,\n 除了刀锋的那条凹槽。」 \n 一个属神的人所能寻求的最光荣的勋章，乃是因事奉而受到的伤痕，因冠冕而受到的损失，因基督而受到的耻辱，因工作而受到的耗损。━选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5581.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
