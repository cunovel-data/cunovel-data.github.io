{"id":15003,"no":46,"title":"February 15","content":"\"Fret not thyself……\" Psalm 37:1)\\n\\n Do not get into a perilous heat about things. If ever heat were justified, it was surely justified in the circumstances outlined in the Psalm. Evil-doers were moving about clothed in purple and fine linen, and faring sumptuously every day. \"…Workers of iniquity…\" (Ps.92:7) were climbing into the supreme places of power, and were tyrannizing their less fortunate brethren. Sinful men and women were stalking through the land in the pride of life and basking in the light and comfort of great prosperity, and good men were becoming heated and fretful.\\n\\n \"Fret not thyself.\" Do not get unduly heated! Keep cool! Even in a good cause, fretfulness is not a wise help-meet. Fretting only heats the bearings; it does not generate the steam. It is no help to a train for the axles to get hot; their heat is only a hindrance. When the axles get heated, it is because of unnecessary friction; dry surfaces are grinding together, which ought to be kept in smooth co-operation by a delicate cushion of oil.\\n\\n And is it not a suggestive fact that this word \"fret\" is closely akin to the word \"friction,\" and is an indication of absence of the anointing oil of the grace of God?\\n\\n In fretfulness, a little bit of grit gets into the bearings━some slight disappointment, some ingratitude, some discourtesy━and the smooth working of the life is checked. Friction begets heat; and with the heat, most dangerous conditions are created.\\n\\n Do not let thy bearings get hot. Let the oil of the Lord keep thee cool, lest by reason of an unholy heat thou be reckoned among the evil-doers. ━The Silver Lining.\\n\\n Dear restless heart, be still; don\u0027t fret and worry so\\n\\n God has a thousand ways His love and help to show\\n\\n Just trust, and trust, and trust, until His will you know.\\n\\n Dear restless heart, be still, for peace is God\u0027s own smile\\n\\n His love can every wrong and sorrow reconcile\\n\\n Just love, and love, and love, and calmly wait awhile.\\n\\n Dear restless heart, be brave; don\u0027t moan and sorrow so,\\n\\n He hath a meaning kind in chilly winds that blow;\\n\\n Just hope, and hope, and hope, until you braver grow.\\n\\n Dear restless heart, repose upon His breast this hour,\\n\\n His grace is strength and life, His love is bloom and flower;\\n\\n Just rest, and rest, and rest, within His tender power.\\n\\n Dear restless heart, be still! Don\u0027t struggle to be free;\\n\\n God\u0027s life is in your life, from Him you may not flee;\\n\\n Just pray, and pray, and pray, till you have faith to see.\\n\\n ━Edith Willis Linn\\n\\n 二月十五日\\n\\n 　　“不要…心怀不平…” （诗三十七：1）\\n\\n 　　不要冒火，抱不平。我们常见作恶者穿了紫色细麻布的长袍，终日宴乐，凡事顺利。“恶人…”（诗九十二：7）执掌大权，欺压不幸的人们。犯罪的男女享受安逸骄奢的生活，因此好人常会冒火，抱不平。\\n\\n 　　可是经上说：“不要…心怀不平”。不要冒火！把火气冷下去！卽使你的冒火是很有理由的，但是也不是一个聪明的办法。不平只会起摩擦，（一种冲突）；不平不能变成和平。一部火车的车轴如果发热了，并不能帮助火车前进；它们的发热只能产生障碍。车轴发热的缘故，乃是为了不必需的摩擦；我们应该让神用祂的恩膏涂在我们不平的地方，以免生出轧轹来。\\n\\n 　　心中怀了不平，就会有许多尖锐锋利的砂粒━急躁，恼恨，嫉妒，无礼等—嵌进来，叫你失去生活中谦和的香气。摩擦生热，热后就会发生最危险的破坏。所以不要怀抱不平。让神的圣膏油使你平滑罢；否则，恐怕因着冒火的缘故，你自己就会列在做恶者之中了。━银衬\\n\\n 不安的心，要宁静；莫烦恼，莫忿怒；\\n\\n 神有无数方法，来显示祂的爱与帮助，\\n\\n 只有信主，深信祂，直到你明白祂的旨意和嘱咐。\\n\\n 不安的心，要宁静，安详表示神的欢颜，\\n\\n 祂的爱能消除一切的乖戾和悲哀；\\n\\n 只要爱主，深爱祂，暂且安详的等待。\\n\\n 不安的心，要勇敢，不要悲伤惆怅，\\n\\n 在那刺骨的寒风中，神送来了慈爱恩惠；\\n\\n 只要盼望，要盼望，直到你的胆大气壮。\\n\\n 不安的心，这时候该在怀里憩息，\\n\\n 祂的慈爱是花，祂的恩典是生命活力，\\n\\n 只管安息，需安息，安息在祂温柔的怀中。\\n\\n 不安的心，要宁静，不必自我挣扎，\\n\\n 神与你的生命已成一片，不可分离，\\n\\n 只管祈祷，多祈祷，使你的信心不移。\\n\\n ━李因译自银衬\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4861.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
