{"id":15292,"no":335,"title":"December 1","content":"\"There remaineth, therefore, a rest to the people of God\" (Heb.4:9) The rest includes victory, \"And the Lord gave them rest round about; . . . the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand\" (Joshua 21:44) \"He will beautify the meek with victory”(Ps.149:4)(Rotherham,margin) An eminent Christian worker tells of his mother who was a very anxious and troubled Christian. He would talk with her by the hour trying to convince her of the sinfulness of fretting, but to no avail. She was like the old lady who once said she had suffered so much, especially from the troubles that never came. But one morning the mother came down to breakfast wreathed in smiles. He asked her what had happened, and she told him that in the night she had a dream. She was walking along a highway with a great crowd of people who seemed so tired and burdened. They were nearly all carrying little black bundles, and she noticed that there were numerous repulsive looking beings which she thought were demons dropping these black bundles for the people to pick up and carry. Like the rest, she too had her needless load, and was weighed down with the devil\u0027s bundles. Looking up, after a while, she saw a Man with a bright and loving face, passing hither and thither through the crowd, and comforting the people. At last He came near her, and she saw that it was her Saviour. She looked up and told Him how tired she was, and He smiled sadly and said: \"My dear child, I did not give you these loads; you have no need of them. They are the devil\u0027s burdens and they are wearing out your life. Just drop them; refuse to touch them with one of your fingers and you will find the path easy and you will be as if borne on eagle\u0027s wings.\" He touched her hand, and lo, peace and joy thrilled her frame and, flinging down her burden, she was about to throw herself at His feet in joyful thanksgiving, when suddenly she awoke and found that all her cares were gone. From that day to the close of her life she was the most cheerful and happy member of the household. ━Selected And the night shall be filled with music, And the cares that infest the day, Shall fold their tents like the Arabs, And as silently steal away. ━Longfellow 十二月一日 「这样看来，必另有一安息，为神的子民存留。」 （来四:9直译） 「耶和华…使他们四境平安…耶和华把一切仇敌都交在他们手中。」 （书廿一:44） 「祂要用救恩当作谦卑人的妆饰。」（诗一四九:4） 一位著名的事奉主的工人告诉我们他母亲的故事： 他的母亲是一位非常多忧多虑的基督人。他常花数小时和她谈话，要想叫她看见烦恼是一个罪，但是没有一点用处。她曾饱经许多苦楚，特别是那些从未来临的。 一天早晨，他母亲下楼来吃早餐；满面笑容，和平常大不相同。他心中非常诧异，就问她甚么事情叫她这样喜乐；她告诉他：夜间她做了一个奇异的梦。 梦中她和一大群疲倦、背重担的人，同在一条大路上行走。他们背上都背着许多黑色的包裹；她看见许多形状可憎的恶魔把那些黑色的包裹撒在地上，让人们去拾起来背着。 她自己也像别人一样，背着那些无须背的重担，觉得非常苦重。过了一会，她抬起头来，看见一位人子，带着一个荣耀的慈颜，在人群中走来走去，安慰人们。 最后那位人子走到她身边来了；她仔细一看，原来是她的主。她仰起头来告诉祂，她非常疲倦，祂带着一个忧愁的笑容对说： 「亲爱的孩子，这些重担不是我给你的，你用不着去背它们。它们是魔鬼给你的，魔鬼要把的你命压出来，你知道么？所以你只要将它们丢下来，连你的手指也不去摸一摸，你就会觉得道路容易了，你也会觉得像生了翅膀一样。」 祂用手一模，看哪，平安和喜乐充满了她的全身；她把她的重担一掷，正想倒在祂脚前感谢祂，她突然醒了，发觉她一切的挂虑都消失了。从这一天起，直到她死的日子，她成了全家最喜乐的一个人。━选 黑夜弥漫着乐声, 白昼的忧虑, 会像阿拉伯人卷起营帐, 悄悄地离去。 ━朗斐罗","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5570.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
