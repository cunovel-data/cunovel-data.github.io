Too often we look on them as great obstacles. It would be a haven of rest and an inspiration of unspeakable power if each of us would henceforth recognize every difficult situation as one of God\u0027s chosen ways of proving to us His love and look around for the signals of His glorious manifestations; then, indeed, would every cloud become a rainbow, and every mountain a path of ascension and a scene of transfiguration. \\n\\n If we will look back upon the past, many of us will find that the very time our Heavenly Father has chosen to do the kindest things for us, and given us the richest blessings, has been the time we were strained and shut in on every side, God\u0027s jewels are often sent us in rough packages and by dark liveried servants, but within we find the very treasures of the King\u0027s palace and the Bridegroom\u0027s love. --- A. B. Simpson. \\n\\n Trust Him in the dark, honor Him with unwavering confidence even in the midst of mysterious dispensations, and the recompense of such faith will be like the moulting of the eagle\u0027s plumes, which was said to give them a new lease of youth and strength. --- J. R. Macduff. \\n\\n \"If we could see beyond today,\\n\\n As God can see;\\n\\n If all the clouds should roll away,\\n\\n The shadows flee;\\n\\n O\u0027er presents griefs we would not fret.\\n\\n Each sorrow we would soon forget,\\n\\n For many joys are waiting yet,\\n\\n For you and me.\\n\\n \"If we could know beyond today,\\n\\n As God doth know,\\n\\n Why dearest treasures pass away,\\n\\n And tears must flow;\\n\\n And why the darioness leads to light,\\n\\n Why dreary paths will soon grow bright;\\n\\n Some day life\u0027s wrong will be made right, \u003c so. us tells Faith\u003e\\n\\n \"If we could see, if we could know;\\n\\n We often say,\\n\\n But God in love a veil doth throw,\\n\\n Across our way;\\n\\n We cannot see what lies before,\\n\\n And so we cling to Him the more,\\n\\n He leads us till this life is o\u0027er; Trust and obey.\" \\n\\n 七月二十九日\\n\\n 「你曾....见过雹仓么？....这....雹乃是我为降灾....的日子所预备的。」（伯三十八: 22、23 ） \\n\\n 　　我们所遭遇的试炼是神给我们的好机会，我们却常常将它当作障碍。如果我们知道每一次的困难都是神所选的方法━向我们证明祂爱的方法━我们就能得到安息和激励。 \\n\\n 　　让我们回想回想过去的经历，我们中间一定有许多人会记得：什么时候我们的父要替我们成就一件美事，要赐我们一件福份，什么时候我们就会遭到痛苦和逼迫。神送我们的礼物，总是包裹得很粗陋，藉皮色黝黑的仆人送来的；但是一打开来，我们就发现里面所包着的，是王宫里的珍宝和新郎的爱。── 信宣 \\n\\n 　　读者，你当在黑暗中仰赖主，用不移的信心尊敬祂；这样，你就会得到新的力量。── 马克特夫\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5280.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
