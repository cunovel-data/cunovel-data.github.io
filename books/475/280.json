{"id":15237,"no":280,"title":"October 7","content":"\"Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? He that walketh in darkness and hath no light,let him trust in the name of Jehovah and rely upon his God\"(Isa.50:10, RV) What shall the believer do in times of darkness the darkness of perplexity and confusion, not of heart but of mind? Times of darkness come to the faithful and believing disciple who is walking obediently in the will of God; seasons when he does not know what to do, nor which way to turn. The sky is overcast with clouds. The clear light of Heaven does not shine upon his pathway. One feels as if he were groping his way in darkness. Beloved, is this you? What shall the believer do in times of darkness? Listen! \"Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God.\" The first thing to do is do nothing. This is hard for poor human nature to do. In the West there is a saying that runs thus, \"When you\u0027re rattled, don\u0027t rush\"; in other words, \"When you don\u0027t know what to do, don\u0027t do it.\" When you run into a spiritual fog bank, don\u0027t tear ahead; slow down the machinery of your life. If necessary, anchor your bark or let it swing at its moorings. We are to simply trust God. While we trust, God can work. Worry prevents Him from doing anything for us. If our minds are distracted and our hearts distressed; if the darkness that overshadows us strikes terror to us; if we run hither and yon in a vain effort to find some way of escape out of a dark place of trial, where Divine providence has put us, the Lord can do nothing for us. The peace of God must quiet our minds and rest our hearts. We must put our hand in the hand of God like a little child, and let Him lead us out into the bright sunshine of His love. He knows the way out of the woods. Let us climb up into His arms, and trust Him to take us out by the shortest and surest road.━Dr.Pardington Remember we are never without a pilot when we know not how to steer. “Hold on, my heart, in thy believing- The steadfast only wins the crown; He who, when stormy winds are heaving, Parts with its anchor, shall go down; But he who Jesus holds through all, Shall stand, though Heaven and earth should fall,” “Hold out.! There comes an end to sorrow; Hope from the dust shall conquering rise; The storm foretells a summer\u0027s morrow; The Cross points on to Paradise; The Father reigneth! cease all doubt; Hold on, my heart hold on, hold out.” 十月七日 「你们中间谁是敬畏耶和华听从祂仆人之话的。这人行在暗中，没有亮光，当倚靠耶和华的名，仗赖自己的神。」 （赛五十:10） 一个信徒在黑暗苦闷中应该怎样呢？在疑难困恼中应该怎样呢？一个忠心顺服神旨意的信徒常会遭到黑暗苦闷的经历，有时竟会叫他不知道该怎样行━天上满布着黑云，路上也看不见亮光；眞好像在暗中摸索一般。 亲爱的，这在暗中摸索的是不是正是你呢？一个信徒在这种黑暗苦闷的时候该怎样行呢？听神的话！「当倚靠耶和华的名，仗赖自己的神。」 第一件当做的事，就是不做甚么。这是可怜的人性很难做到的一件事。在西方有一句格言说：「困恼的时候不要急冲。」这意思就是说：「你不知当做甚么的时候，就当不做。」 要是前面有雾，就不该再向前航行。在必需的时候，还该抛下锚去。照样，在黑暗苦闷的时候，我们不该再做甚么。我们所要做的祇是信靠仰赖神。惟有在我们信靠的时候，神纔能替我们工作。如果我们的心仍自忧急痛苦，如果覆蔽我们的黑暗仍能叫我们恐怖，如果我们仍然东奔西走地去逃避神给我们的试炼，我告诉你：神一点都不能替我们做甚么。 我们应当静下我们的心来安息在神的平安里。我们应当像小孩一般把我们的手放在神的手中，让祂引领我们进入祂爱的光明中去。 树林里的路径只有祂最熟悉，所以让我们爬上祂的双臂去；祂必怀抱我们从最简捷最稳妥的路径出去。━巴亭登 我们不知道该怎样驾驶的时候，旁边绝不会没有向导的。 我的心哪,要坚持你的信仰- 唯有固守不移者才会得胜； 在海上遇到了狂风暴浪, 若离开铁锚,你的命运势必蹭蹬； 凡是始终握住耶稣的人, 即使天崩地塌,也能站立稳定。 你要坚守!悲痛终会完结之时, 尘土之中将兴起战胜的光芒, 暴风雨预示忧日的来临； 十字架指向天上的王, 父神在统治一切,停止你种种疑虑, 我的心,你要握住,坚持不放。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5515.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
