{"id":15318,"no":361,"title":"December 27","content":"“His soul entered into iron” (Ps. 105:18)\n Turn that about and render it in our language, and it reads thus, \"Iron entered his soul.\" Is there not a truth in this? That sorrow and privation, the yoke borne in the youth, the soul\u0027s enforced restraint, are all conducive to an iron tenacity and strength of purpose, and endurance or fortitude, which are the indispensable foundation and framework of a noble character.\n Do not flinch from suffering; bear it silently, patiently, resignedly; and be sure that it is God\u0027s way of infusing iron into your spiritual life. The world wants iron dukes, iron battalions, iron sinews, and thews of steel. God wants iron saints; and since there is no way of imparting iron to the moral nature but by letting people suffer, He lets them suffer.\n Are the best years of your life slipping away in enforced monotony? Are you beset by opposition, misunderstanding, and scorn, as the thick undergrowth besets the passage of the woodsman pioneer? Then take heart; the time is not wasted; God is only putting you through the iron regimen. The iron crown of suffering precedes the golden crown of glory. And iron is entering into your soul to make it strong and brave. ━F. B. Meyer\n “But you will not mind the roughness nor the steepness of the way,\n Nor the chill, unrested morning, nor the searness of the day;\n And you will not take a turning to the left or the right,\n But go straight ahead, nor tremble at the coming of the night,\n For the road leads home.” \n 十二月二十七日\n “他的魂被铁捆拘。” （诗一百零五:18直译）\n 我们的悲哀、困难、铁轭、束缚，好似一个铁圈，把我们紧紧围住。它们替我们造出力量来、忍耐来、刚毅来。\n 　　信徒啊，不要逃避苦难；安安静静、忍忍耐耐、顺顺服服地忍受着；要知到这是神泡制你的方法。世界喜欢铁血将军；神喜欢铁血圣徒。除了让我们受苦以外，没有别的方法可以把我们制成铁血圣徒；所以神只得忍痛让我们受苦。\n 　　亲爱的，你觉得一生最好的年日在沙漠生活中虚渡了么？你是不是正被反对、误会、侮蔑…等围困呢？振起精神来，你现在所花的时间并不是虚度的；神叫你经过铁的训练。荣耀的金冠冕之前，必有苦难的铁冠冕。\n ━梅尔\n 你不會介意路途的不平或艱險,\n 也不會介意寒冷莫測的早晨,\n 更不會介意白晝的炎熱難堪；\n 你不會向左或向右轉彎,\n 只是勇往直前,不怕黑夜來臨,\n 因為這條路通往家門。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5596.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
