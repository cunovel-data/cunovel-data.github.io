Comfort does not come to the light-hearted and merry. We must go down into \"depths\" if we would experience this most precious of God\u0027s gifts—comfort, and thus be prepared to be co-workers together with Him. When night━needful night━gathers over the garden of our souls, when the leaves close up, and the flowers no longer hold any sunlight within their folded petals, there shall never be wanting, even in the thickest darkness, drops of heavenly dew--dew which falls only when the sun has gone. –Selected “I have been through the valley of weeping, The valley of sorrow and pain; But the ‘ God of all comfort ’ was with me, At hand to uphold and sustain.” \"As the earth needs the clouds and sunshine, Our souls need both sorrow and joy So He places us oft in the furnace, The dross from the gold to destroy.” “When he leads thro\u0027some valley of trouble, His omnipotent hand we trace; For the trials and sorrows He sends us, Are part of His lessons in grace.” “Oft we shrink from the purging and pruning, Forgetting the Husbandman knows That the deeper the cutting and paring, The richer the cluster that grows”. “Well He knows that affliction is needed; He has ct wise purpose in view, And in the dark valley He whispers, \u0027Hereafter Thou \u0027It know what I do.” “As We travel thro \u0027 life\u0027s shadow \u0027d valley, Fresh springs of His love ever rise; And we learn that our sorrows and losses, Are blessings just sent in disguise.” “So we\u0027ll follow; wherever He leadeth, Let the path be dreary or bright; For we\u0027ve proved that our God can give comfort; Our God can give songs in the night.” 八月九日 「靠祢有力量….的，这人便为有福。他们经过流泪谷，叫这谷变为泉源之地。」（诗八十四5-6） 快乐欢欣的人，不能知道安慰的甜蜜。如果我们想得到神最贵重的礼物━安慰━我们必须进入「深处」与神合作。 大地怎样需要黑云与日光，我们也同样需要悲伤与欢乐。──选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5305.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
