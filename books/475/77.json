{"id":15034,"no":77,"title":"March 18","content":"\"He answered nothing.\" (Mark 15:3) There is no spectacle in all the Bible so sublime as the silent Savior answering not a word to the men who were maligning Him, and whom He could have laid prostrate at His feet by one look of Divine power, or one word of fiery rebuke. But He let them say and do their worst, and He stood in THE POWER OF STILLNESS--God\u0027s holy silent Lamb. There is a stillness that lets God work for us, and holds our peace; the stillness that ceases from its contriving and its self-vindication, and its expedients of wisdom and forethought, and lets God provide and answer the cruel blow, in His own unfailing, faithful love. How often we lose God\u0027s interposition by taking up our own cause, and striking for our defense. God give to us this silent power, this conquered spirit! And after the heat and strife of earth are over, men will remember us as we remember the morning dew, the gentle light and sunshine, the evening breeze, the Lamb of Calvary, and the gentle, holy heavenly Dove. --A. B. Simpson. The day when Jesus stood alone And felt the hearts of men like stone, And knew He came but to atone That day \"He held His peace.\" They witnessed falsely to His word, They bound Him with a cruel cord, And mockingly proclaimed Him Lord; \"But Jesus held His peace.\" They spat upon Him in the face, They dragged Him on from place to place, They heaped upon Him all disgrace; \"But Jesus held His peace.\" My friend, have you for far much less, With rage, which you called righteousness, Resented slights with great distress? Your Saviour \"held His peace.\" --L. S. P. I remember once hearing Bishop Whipple, of Minnesota, so well known as \"The Apostle of the Indians,\" utter these beautiful words: \"For thirty years I have tried to see the face of Christ in those with whom I differed.\" When this spirit actuates us we shall be preserved at once from a narrow bigotry and an easy-going tolerance, from passionate vindictiveness and everything that would mar or injure our testimony for Him who came not to destroy men\u0027s lives, but to save them. --W. H. Griffith Thomas. 　 三月十八日 “耶稣仍不回答”(可十五：5)。 　　圣经中顶希奇的一幕，就是创造天地的主，一声不响地站在诽谤他的人面前受冤枉。他可以运用他的能力向他们一看，或者向他们出一声责备，就使他们倒在他的脚前。但是他不动声色，任凭他们作恶妄为。他站着是表显神镇静的能力——神无声的羔羊！ 　　我们也当有这样的镇静。这样的镇静可以给神机会替我们工作，给我们平安；这样的镇静就是停止自己的谋画和活动，摒除自己的智慧和成见，让神单独去应付人们的攻击。 　　多少时侯，我们失败，就是因为没有神的镇静。我们顶会用自己的智慧和力量来自卫，因此失去了神爱的力量，以致落入急躁慌乱。因为这正是神所赐下的缄默和自制力量。当尘世的扰攘过去之后，人们将怀念我们，好象我们怀念露珠，曙光和太阳，那晚风和各各他的羔羊，和那至善至尊至福的天堂。——宣信 这一天，耶稣形单影只， 体验到人心硬如铁石， 但知道他之降临人世， 他缄默为了救赎众生。 他们以假见证对他毁谤， 用绳索残酷地把他捆绑， 讥嘲他为犹太人的王； 但耶稣缄默着，不作反抗。 唾沫污辱了他的脸， 把耶稣拖东拉西任意磨折， 使他受尽了屈辱与轻蔑； 但耶稣保持缄默。 为了远逊于此的轻微小事， 你曾否发怒，自以为理直气壮， 小小的龃龉，当作了大侮辱？ 救世主却保持缄默。 L.S.P. 　　在明尼苏达州的威波主教，众人都称他为印地安人的使徒，我记得他曾说过这样一句动人的话：“叁十年来，当我与人龃龉不合的时候，我总是想法从对方的脸上见到基督的圣容”。假若我们亦被这种美德所感动，我们立刻化褊狭为谦容，不至有报复的冲动，而损伤了我们为主作见证人的立场，因为他来到尘世，不是要毁灭生命，乃是要拯救人类。——汤麦斯","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5013.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
