(See Daniel 9:20-27 and 10:12.) --Messages for the Morning Watch.\\n\\n When we believe for a blessing, we must take the attitude of faith, and begin to act and pray as if we had the blessing. We must treat God as if He had given us our request. We must lean our weight over upon Him for the thing that we have claimed, and just take it for granted that He gives it, and is going to continue to give it. This is the attitude of trust.\\n\\n When the wife is married, she at once falls into a new attitude, and acts in accordance with the fact; and so when we take Christ as our Savior, as our Sanctifier, as our Healer, or as our Deliverer, He expects us to fall into the attitude of recognizing Him in the capacity that we have claimed, and expect Him to be to us all that we have trusted Him for. --Selected.\\n\\n \"The thing I ask when God doth bid me pray,\\n\\n Begins in that same act to come my way.\"\\n\\n 　 五月十九日\\n\\n “话还没有说完……说，耶和华……是应当称颂的，因他不断的以慈爱诚实待我……”（创二十四：15，27）。\\n\\n 　　每一个正当的祷告，都是“话还没有说完”，神就答应的。这是因为神已经给了我们他的应许——凡奉主的名（就是与主并他的旨意合一）无论求什么，只要信，就必得着。\\n\\n 　　神不能抵赖他所应许的，当我们履行了这些简单的祷告的条件，他不能不答应我们所求的。我们祷告的“话还没有说完”，在天上宝座前就已经成全了；虽然在地上不一定就能看见。\\n\\n 　　所以祷告之后，最好用赞美来作结束——赞美神已经听了我们的祷告，赞美神不断的以慈爱诚实待我们。（参读但九章二十至二十七节，又十章十二节）。——译自晨更信息\\n\\n 　　当我们相信一件事的时候，我们就应该有相信的行为——我们的动作，我们的祷告，都当和我们的信心相符。我们应该算神已经给了我们所求的，这才是信心的态度。——选\\n\\n 　　一个妇人结婚之后，她当进入一种的生活态度，一切行动都要以这个结婚的事实为依据。我们既尊基督是我们的救主，我们成圣称义的引导，诊治我们疾病的医生，拯救我们的恩主，他就希望我们亦采取一种新的态度，一切以承认他是我们的救主，导师，医生，恩人的事实为依归，并且盼望他的确是我们所希望的一样完全来成全我们。\\n\\n “遵照神的命令祷告，我所祈求的，\\n\\n 在开始的时候，已在向我降临了”。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5128.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
