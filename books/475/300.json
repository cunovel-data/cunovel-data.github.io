{"id":15257,"no":300,"title":"October 27","content":"\"All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. \" Psalm 42:7 THEY are HIS billows, whether they go o\u0027er us, Hiding His face in smothering spray and foam; Or smooth and sparkling, spread at path before us, And to our haven bear us safely home. They are HIS billows, whether for our succor He walks across them, stilling all our fear; Or to our cry there comes no aid nor answer, And in the lonely silence none is near. They are HIS billows, whether we are toiling Through tempest-driven waves that never cease, While deep to deep with clamor loud is calling; Or at His word they hush themselves in peace. They are HIS billows, whether He divides them, Making us walk dryshod where seas had flowed; Or lets tumultuous breakers surge about us, Rushing unchecked across our only road. They are HIS billows, and He brings us through them; So He has promised, so His love will do. Keeping and leading, guiding and upholding, To His sure harbor, He will bring us through. ━Annie Johnson Flint Stand up in the place where the dear Lord has put you, and there do your best. God gives us trial tests. He puts life before us as an antagonist face to face. Out of the buffeting of a serious conflict we are expected to grow strong. The tree that grows where tempests toss its boughs and bend its trunk often almost to breaking, is often more firmly rooted than the tree which grows in the sequestered valley where no storm ever brings stress or strain. The same is true of life. The grandest character is grown in hardship. ━Selected 十月二十七日 「你的波浪洪涛漫过我身。」 （诗四十二:7） 这是祂的洪涛，漫过了我身， 有时以窒息的浪花，掩着圣容； 有时以柔细的泡沬，为我们开路， 带我们安全进港，安回家中。 这是祂的洪涛，有时为救我们， 祂从海口走过，使忧愁逐出我们的心胸； 也有时候我们呼求，却没有回应， 孤寂之中竟没有援助到临。 这是祂的洪涛，有时冲着我们， 它们狂啸怒的喧嚷航行， 在永不停息的风浪中历尽艰辛, 也有时候祂一声命令,万籁肃静。 这是祂的洪涛，有时将海水分开， 让我们走过海底、如踏干地； 也有时候祂任凭巨浪澎湃， 在我们的路上横行无忌。 这是祂的洪涛，祂带我们通过； 既曾如此应许，祂必实现诺言。 祂用保护和指挥，引导扶持； 带我们通过，抵达安全港湾。 ━富林德 信徒阿，让我们在主所安放我们的地位上好好站住，尽我们所能的去做。神常喜欢给我们一些试炼，因为神希望我们经过剧烈的争斗以后，能发育得更加强壮。生长在风雨之下，曾受风雨击打的树木，往往比生长在退隐的山谷下，从未受过风雨摧残的树木，扎根更深。人生也是这样。伟大的人物都是生长在艰苦中的。━选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5535.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
