{"id":15134,"no":177,"title":"June 26","content":"\"For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?\" (Rom. 3:3) I think that I can trace every scrap of sorrow in my life to simple unbelief. How could I be anything but quite happy if I believed always that all the past is forgiven, and all the present furnished with power, and all the future bright with hope because of the same abiding facts which do not change with my mood, do not stumble because I totter and stagger at the promise through unbelief, but stand firm and clear with their peaks of pearl cleaving the air of Eternity, and the bases of their hills rooted unfathomably in the Rock of God. Mont Blanc does not become a phantom or a mist because a climber grows dizzy on its side. --James Smetham. Is it any wonder that, when we stagger at any promise of God through unbelief, we do not receive it? Not that faith merits an answer, or in any way earns it, or works it out; but God has made believing a condition of receiving, and the Giver has a sovereign right to choose His own terms of gift. --Rev. Samuel Hart. Unbelief says, \"How can such and such things be?\" It is full of \"hows\"; but faith has one great answer to the ten thousand \"hows,\" and that answer is--GOD! --C. H. M. No praying man or woman accomplishes so much with so little expenditure of time as when he or she is praying. If there should arise, it has been said--and the words are surely true to the thought of our Lord Jesus Christ in all His teaching on prayer--if there should arise ONE UTTERLY BELIEVING MAN, the history of the world might be changed. Will YOU not be that one in the providence and guidance of God our Father? --A. E. McAdam. Prayer without faith degenerates into objectless routine, or soulless hypocrisy. Prayer with faith brings Omnipotence to back our petitions. Better not pray unless and until your whole being responds to the efficacy of your supplication. When the true prayer is breathed, earth and heaven, the past and the future, say Amen. And Christ prayed such prayers. --P. C. M. \"Nothing lies beyond the reach of prayer except that which lies outside the will of God.\" 　 六月二十六日 “即便有不信的，这有何妨呢？难道他们的不信，就废掉神的信么”？（罗三：3）。 　　我可以说：我一生所有的忧虑，都是由不信产生的。如果我时常相信——我已往的一切都已蒙神赦免；现在的一切都带着主的能力；将来的一切多么光明，因为永生的真实，不会因为我的冷淡而更变，不会因我的失败而消灭——我怎能不欢喜快乐呢？——司买丹 　　当我们带着不信的恶心来怀疑神的允许的时候，顶希奇，我们就得不着那允许了。这并不是说我们的信心该受神的答应，也不是说神的答应是能用信心赚得的；却是因为神曾这样命定：得允许的条件就是信心。赐恩者自有主权选定任何条件来换取他的恩赐。——赫德 　　不信说：“怎样会这样？怎样会那样？”信心只用一个字去答复它的千万个“怎样”，这个字就是——神！——马金都 从来没有一个人，只花极少的时间祷告，却获得极大的成功的。 　　有人说：世上如果兴起一个全然相信的人来，世界的历史就会随着改变。 读者，你愿不愿意起来做这个人呢？——马克亚当 　　没有信心的祷告，会造成无目标的惯例，卑陋的虚伪。如果你的全人还没有同心合意地参加你的祈祷，我劝你还是再等一会祈祷吧！真实的祈祷一发声，天地都会同说阿们。耶稣基督的祈祷，就是这样。 没有一件东西不能借着祈祷求得除非那件东西在神的旨意以外。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5180.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
