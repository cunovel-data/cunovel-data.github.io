{"id":15035,"no":78,"title":"March 19","content":"\"Beloved, do not be surprised at the ordeal that has come to test you…you are sharing what Christ suffered; so rejoice in it.\" (1 Peter 4:12) \n \n Many a waiting hour was needful to enrich the harp of David, and many a waiting hour in the wilderness will gather for us a psalm of \"thanksgiving, and the voice of melody,\" to cheer the hearts of fainting ones here below, and to make glad our Father\u0027s house on high. \n \n What was the preparation of the son of Jesse for the songs like unto which none other have ever sounded on this earth? \n \n The outrage of the wicked, which brought forth cries for God\u0027s help. Then the faint hope in God\u0027s goodness blossomed into a song of rejoicing for His mighty deliverances and manifold mercies. Every sorrow was another string to his harp; every deliverance another theme for praise. \n \n One thrill of anguish spared, one blessing unmarked or unprized, one difficulty or danger evaded, how great would have been our loss in that thrilling Psalmody in which God\u0027s people today find the expression of their grief or praise! \n \n To wait for God, and to suffer His will, is to know Him in the fellowship of His sufferings, and to be conformed to the likeness of His Son. So now, if the vessel is to be enlarged for spiritual understanding, be not affrighted at the wider sphere of suffering that awaits you. The Divine capacity of sympathy will have a more extended sphere, for the breathing of the Holy Ghost in the new creation never made a stoic, but left the heart\u0027s affection tender and true. --Anna Shipton. \n \n \"He tested me ere He entrusted me.\" (1 Tim. 1:12) ( Way\u0027s Trans.) \n \n 　 三月十九日 \n \n “亲爱的啊，有火炼的试验临到你们，不要以为奇怪…倒要欢喜；因为你们是与基督一同受苦”(彼前四：12/13)。 \n \n 　　大卫的遭难使他的古琴发出更悦耳的音乐来，他的遇险使他发出“感谢，和歌唱的声音”(赛五十一：3)来；他的诗篇直到今天仍能叫地上的许多软弱信徒得到帮助，叫天上的父神得到快乐。 \n \n 　　究竟什么东西使耶西的儿子有这般属灵的修养呢？ \n \n 　　仇敌的吼叫，逼他发出向神的呼吁来。神大能的拯救，丰富的恩慈，使他唱出感谢和欢乐的赞美来。所以，每一次的苦难在他琴上添一根弦；每一次的拯救给他一个赞美的新题目。 \n \n 　　一次痛苦躲过，一次祝福扣留；一次危难避去，一次荣耀失去。平稳度日的人不懂得依靠，所以他们不会看见神的荣耀，也不会唱出赞美来。 \n \n 　　如果我们要多明白属灵的奥秘，我们就不能惧怕在前面等待我们的苦难；因为有许多宝贝的功课，是必须在苦难中方能学到的。——薛伯登 \n \n 　　“他试验我，为要派我服事他”(提前一：12韦氏译本)。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5014.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
