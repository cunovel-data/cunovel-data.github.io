{"id":15211,"no":254,"title":"September 11","content":"\"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise\" (Heb. 6:15). Abraham was long tried, but he was richly rewarded. The Lord tried him by delaying to fulfill His promise. Satan tried him by temptation; men tried him by jealousy, distrust, and opposition; Sarah tried him by her peevishness. But he patiently endured. He did not question God\u0027s veracity, nor limit His power, nor doubt His faithfulness, nor grieve His love; but he bowed to Divine Sovereignty, submitted to Infinite Wisdom, and was silent under delays, waiting the Lord\u0027s time. And so, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise. God\u0027s promises cannot fail of their accomplishment. Patient waiters cannot be disappointed. Believing expectation shall be realized. Beloved, Abraham\u0027s conduct condemns a hasty spirit, reproves a murmuring one, commends a patient one, and encourages quiet submission to God\u0027s will and way. Remember, Abraham was tried; he patiently waited; he received the promise, and was satisfied. Imitate his example, and you will share the same blessing.—Selected 九月十一日 「这样，亚伯拉罕既恒久忍耐，就得了所应许的。」（来六15） 读者，亚伯拉罕所受的试验极久，但是他所得到的酬报却极厚。神用迁延应许的方法试验他，撒但用诱惑试验他；世人用嫉妒、怀疑、反对、；试验他撒拉用乖戾的性情试验他。但是他却恒久忍耐。他并不质问神的诚实，也不限制神的权力；他不怀疑神的信实，也不伤忧神的慈心；但向神圣的君王俯伏、绝对信任祂的智慧。虽然神迁延日久，他却并不作声，只安安心心地等待神的时候。这样，他既恒久忍耐，就得了所应许的。 神的应许，是不能不完成的。忍耐的等候者，是不能失望的。信心的盼望，终必实现。亲爱的，亚伯拉罕的德行，眞叫急躁的人受羞愧，叫出怨言的人受谴责，叫忍耐的人得揄扬，叫安心顺服神旨的人得鼓励。请你记得，亚伯拉罕曾受过试验，曾恒久等候，曾得了所应许的，而心满意足了。你当效法他的榜样，这样，你将要享受到同样的祝福。－－选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5402.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
