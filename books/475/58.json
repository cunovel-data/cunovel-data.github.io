What different sensations those words conjure up to each of us. To some they spell loneliness and desolation, to others rest and quiet. To be left alone without God, would be too awful for words, but to be left alone with Him is a foretaste of Heaven! If His followers spent more time alone with Him, we should have spiritual giants again. The Master set us an example. Note how often He went to be alone with God; and He had a mighty purpose behind the command, \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray.\"(Mt.6:6) The greatest miracles of Elijah and Elisha took place when they were alone with God. It was alone with God that Jacob became a prince; and just there that we, too, may become princes━\"men (aye, and women too!) wondered at\" (Gen. 32:28). Joshua was alone when the Lord came to him. (Josh. 1:1) Gideon and Jephthah were by themselves when commissioned to save Israel. (Judges 6:11 and 11:29) Moses was by himself at the wilderness bush. (Exodus 3:1-5) Cornelius was praying by himself when the angel came to him. (Acts 10:2) No one was with Peter on the house top, when he was instructed to go to the Gentiles. (Acts 10:9) John the Baptist was alone in the wilderness (Luke 1:80), and John the Beloved alone in Patmos, when nearest God. (Rev. 1:9) Covet to get alone with God. If we neglect it, we not only rob ourselves, but others too, of blessing, since when we are blessed we are able to pass on blessing to others. It may mean less outside work; it must mean more depth and power, and the consequence, too, will be \"they saw no man save Jesus only.\"(Mt.17:8) ━Selected 二月二十七日 “只剩下雅各布一人；有一个人来和他摔交，直到黎明” （创卅二：24） 　　剩下一人！我们各人对于这四个字都有不同的感觉。有人剩下一人时感觉何等孤单寂寞；也有人剩下一人时感觉幽静，可得安息。总之，剩下一人而没有神同在，是太凄凉的事；剩下一人而有主同在的话，是预尝天上的光景！如果神的儿女能多和祂单独接触，我们都要变作属灵的伟人了。 　　我们的主给我们作了一个榜样。多少次数祂独自退去单独亲近神；祂吩咐我们“你祷告的时侯，要进你的内屋，关上门”（太六：6）的目的，乃是要我们单独亲近神。 　　伊莱贾和伊莱沙最大的神迹，乃是在他们单独亲近神的时侯出现的。雅各布在单独亲近神的时侯，成为一个王子。（以色列的意思就是王子）。我们若单独亲近神,也能成为王子。乔舒亚在单独亲近神的时侯，得到胜利的把握 (书1:1)。基甸和耶弗他在单独亲近神的时侯，得到神的遣征。(士6:11 及11:29) 摩西独自在旷野中的时候，看见神的异象。(出3:1-5) 哥尼流在独自祷告的时候，看见天使。(徒10:2) 彼得独自在房顶上与神单独接触的时侯，受神托付到外邦人中去 (徒10:9)。施洗约翰独自住在旷野 (路1:80)；耶稣所爱的门徒约翰独自在拔摩海岛上，孤单中他最接近神，所以得到了神最大的启示。(启1:9) 　　让我们渴慕单独和神亲近。如果我们把这件事情忽略了，我们就要失去树和枝子的交通，能力，以及天上各样属灵的福气。这是何等大的损失呢？并且我们不但剥夺了自己的祝福，也剥夺了别人的祝福，因为在我们自己得到祝福的时侯，我们纔能带祝福给别人。单独亲近神也许要减少我们外面的工作；但是单独亲近神会给我们更大的能力；结果，我们就会“不见一人，只见耶稣在那里”。（太十七：8）━选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4873.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
