{"id":15018,"no":61,"title":"March 2","content":"\"Be ready in the morning, and come up...present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. And no man shall come up with thee.\" (Exod. 34:2, 3) \n \n The morning watch is essential. You must not face the day until you have faced God, nor look into the face of others until you have looked into His. \n \n You cannot expect to be victorious, if the day begins only in your own strength. Face the work of every day with the influence of a few thoughtful, quiet moments with your heart and God. Do not meet other people, even those of your own home, until you have first met the great Guest and honored Companion of your life--Jesus Christ. \n \n Meet Him alone. Meet Him regularly. Meet Him with His open Book of counsel before you; and face the regular and the irregular duties of each day with the influence of His personality definitely controlling your every act. \n \n Begin the day with God! \n \n He is thy Sun and Day! \n \n His is the radiance of thy dawn; \n \n To Him address thy lay. \n \n Sing a new song at morn! \n \n Join the glad woods and hills; \n \n Join the fresh winds and seas and plains, \n \n Join the bright flowers and rills. \n \n Sing thy first song to God! \n \n Not to thy fellow men; \n \n Not to the creatures of His hand, \n \n But to the glorious One. \n \n Take thy first walk with God! \n \n Let Him go forth with thee; \n \n By stream, or sea, or mountain path, \n \n Seek still His company. \n \n Thy first transaction be \n \n With God Himself above; \n \n So shall thy business prosper well, \n \n And all the day be love. \n \n --Horatius Bonar. \n \n The men who have done the most for God in this world have been early upon their knees. \n \n Matthew Henry used to be in his study at four, and remain there till eight; then, after breakfast and family prayer, he used to be there again till noon; after dinner, he resumed his book or pen till four, and spent the rest of the day in visiting his friends. \n \n 　 三月二日 \n \n “明日早晨，你要预备好了，上…山，在山顶上站在我面前。谁也不可和你一同上去”（出三十四：2/3）。 \n \n 　　在基督人的生命中，晨更是非常重要的。每天早晨我们必须先见神的面，然后再见人和世界。 \n \n 　　如果一天的开始是凭我们自己的力量的，我们就不能盼望得胜。在每天开始工作之前，必须在读经中，祷告中，或静默中，先和神有交通。切勿先见别人，甚至自己的家人，直等到我们先接见了我们生命中至大至尊的贵客耶稣基督。 \n \n 　　单独去见他。天天按时去见他。带着圣经去见他；把我们一天中要作的事都带到他面前去，我们就会得到意想不到的力量和指示。 \n \n 一天开始，先与神见面， \n \n 他是你的光明，你的太阳！ \n \n 他是破除黑暗的曙光； \n \n 献上你的祈祷，让他度量。 \n \n 清晨起来唱一首新歌； \n \n 与山林一同喜悦相合唱， \n \n 与清新空气，海洋和原野， \n \n 与那明媚的花朵一同歌唱。 \n \n 将你第一首歌献给主， \n \n 不是唱给凡人去听闻， \n \n 不是唱给任何被造物， \n \n 只是唱给独一荣耀之真神。 \n \n 先和神去作一次同行， \n \n 好让神在你前面引导， \n \n 在河边，在海滩，在山径， \n \n 全由神来作你的护行。 \n \n 在天上的父， \n \n 作你今天第一位主顾； \n \n 你的事业必然兴旺， \n \n 整天都在神的慈爱中。 \n \n ——庞纳 \n \n 　　许多为神作大事业的信徒，都是一早就跪在神面前的。 \n \n 　　亨利马太（Henry Matthew）每天早晨四点钟就在他的书房里读经，祷告了；到八点钟出来用早餐。早餐后，举行家庭晨祷；完毕后，又到密室中去和神亲近，直到午时；午餐后，他又回到书房里去读属灵的书籍，或写作，直到四点钟；其余的时间，去探望朋友。——选 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4997.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
