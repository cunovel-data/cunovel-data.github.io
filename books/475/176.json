{"id":15133,"no":176,"title":"June 25","content":"\"Speak unto the children of Israe, that they go forward.\" (Exod. 14:15) Imagine, O child of God, if you can, that triumphal march! The excited children restrained from ejaculations of wonder by the perpetual hush of their parents; the most uncontrollable excitement of the women as they found themselves suddenly saved from a fate worse than death; while the men followed or accompanied them ashamed or confounded that they had ever mistrusted God or murmured against Moses; and as you see those mighty walls of water piled by the outstretched hand of the Eternal, in response to the faith of a single man, learn what God will do for His own. Dread not any result of implicit obedience to His command; fear not the angry waters which, in their proud insolence, forbid your progress. Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, \"the Lord sitteth King for ever.\" A storm is only as the outskirts of His robe, the symptom of His advent, the environment of His presence. Dare to trust Him; dare to follow Him! And discover that the very forces which barred your progress and threatened your life, at His bidding become the materials of which an avenue is made to liberty. --F. B. Meyer. Have you come to the Red Sea place in your life, Where, in spite of all you can do, There is no way out, there is no way back, There is no other way but through? Then wait on the Lord with a trust serene Till the night of your fear is gone; He will send the wind, He will heap the floods, When He says to your soul, \"Go on.\" And His hand will lead you through--clear through-- Ere the watery walls roll down, No foe can reach you, no wave can touch, No mightiest sea can drown; The tossing billows may rear their crests, Their foam at your feet may break, But over their bed you shall walk dry shod In the path that your Lord will make. In the morning watch, \u0027neath the lifted cloud, You shall see but the Lord alone, When He leads you on from the place of the sea To a land that you have not known; And your fears shall pass as your foes have passed, You shall be no more afraid; You shall sing His praise in a better place, A place that His hand has made. --Annie Johnson Flint. 　　 六月二十五日 “你吩咐以色列人往前走。”（出十四：15）。 　　神的儿女啊，你当回想以色列人渡红海时的那段凯旋光景！他们的妇女孩子怎样因着看见自己忽然得了拯救——脱离了比死还可怕的命运——而惊讶；他们的男子怎样因着想到自己以前屡次不肯信靠神，怨恨反叛摩西而羞愧。亲爱的读者，当你看见永生的神怎样因着一人的信心，伸出他的手来将大水堆成墙垣，你就该知道神也照样会按着你的信心给你成就。 　　当你决意顺服神的时候，不要担心顺服的结局怎样；不要去怕那阻止你前进的狂风暴浪，因为“在洪水泛滥之时，耶和华坐着为王，直到永远”（诗二十九：10）。 　　风浪是神义袍的边襟，再临的征候，同在的证据。 　　大着胆信靠他！大着胆随从他！不久你就会发见：那拦阻你前进的阻力，会因着神的命令，变成自由的进路。——梅尔 你生平可曾遇见红海似的绝境？ 在那儿，不论你有多少本领， 无法后退，也无法前进， 除了冲过去，没有别的路径。 然后以安定的信心依靠神， 静待你所畏惧的黑夜消隐， 他会送来大风，把海水堆成高峰， 再吩咐你的灵魂，继续前进。 他的手会引导你从海中经过， 然后水堆的高墙再渐渐合拢， 仇敌不能追你，海水亦不能伤你， 不必担心波涛的汹涌， 也许翻腾的浪花耸得嵩高， 也许有水沫溅到你脚边， 但你必踏着干燥海底， 你路上安排有主安排，向前跨前。 到了早晨，在升起的云层里， 你必见主的圣荣和光芒， 引导你过海前进， 到你所不知道的地方， 敌人逃遁，恐惧也就遗忘， 再没有什么可使你惊惶， 你将在理想的安全之处， 欢声高唱，赞美神。 ——富林德","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5179.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
