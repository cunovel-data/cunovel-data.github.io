{"id":15266,"no":309,"title":"November 5","content":"“Is there anything too hard for Jehovah?” (Gen.18:14) Here is God\u0027s loving challenge to you and to me today. He wants us to think of the deepest, highest, worthiest desire and longing of our hearts, something which perhaps was our desire for ourselves or for someone dear to us, yet which has been so long unfulfilled that we have looked upon it as only a lost desire, that which might have been but now cannot be, and so have given up hope of seeing it fulfilled in this life. That thing, if it is in line with what we know to be His expressed will (as a son to Abraham and Sarah was), God intends to do for us, even if we know that it is of such utter impossibility that we only laugh at the absurdity of anyone\u0027s supposing it could ever now come to pass. That thing God intends to do for us, if we will let Him. \"Is anything too hard for the Lord?\" Not when we believe in Him enough to go forward and do His will, and let Him do the impossible for us. Even Abraham and Sarah could have blocked God\u0027s plan if they had continued to disbelieve. The only thing too hard for Jehovah is deliberate, continued disbelief in His love and power, and our final rejection of His plans for us. Nothing is too hard for Jehovah to do for them that trust Him ━Messages for the Morning Watch 十一月五日 「耶和华岂有难成的事么？」 （创十八:14） 这是神今天给你我的一个责问。也许我们心中曾经有过一个最深、最高、最大的愿望━或者是关于我们自己的，或者是关于我们所爱的人的━经过了好久，还没有成就；我们就以为以前还有成功的可能，现在是绝不能成功的了，于是就把今生能成为事实的希望完全放弃了。 那一个愿望，如果是合乎神旨意的，神必替我们成就；虽然照我们看来，也许是完全不可能的一回事了──也许我们一听见人说起，还会笑为荒谬。那一个愿望，神必替我们成就，如果我们肯让祂成就。 「耶和华岂有难成的事么？」没有；如果我们相信祂，按照祂的旨意前行，让祂独自去替我们做那不可能的，耶和华就没有难成的事了。不然的话，连亚伯拉罕和撒拉也有拦阻神旨意的可能。 那惟一能拦阻神的，就是：继续不信祂的慈爱与能力；和一直拒绝神在我们身上的计划。对于那些信靠祂的人，耶和华是没有一件难成的事的。━译自晨更信息","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5544.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
