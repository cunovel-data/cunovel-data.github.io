{"id":15069,"no":112,"title":"April 22","content":"\"He knoweth the way that I take.\" (Job 23:10)\n Believer! What a glorious assurance! This way of thine--this, it may be, a crooked, mysterious, tangled way--this way of trial and tears. \"He knoweth it.\" The furnace seven times heated--He lighted it. There is an Almighty Guide knowing and directing our footsteps, whether it be to the bitter Marah pool, or to the joy and refreshment of Elim.\n That way, dark to the Egyptians, has its pillar of cloud and fire for His own Israel. The furnace is hot; but not only can we trust the hand that kindles it, but we have the assurance that the fires are lighted not to consume, but to refine; and that when the refining process is completed (no sooner--no later) He brings His people forth as gold.\n When they think Him least near, He is often nearest. \"When my spirit was overwhelmed, then thou knewest my path.\"\n Do we know of ONE brighter than the brightest radiance of the visible sun, visiting our chamber with the first waking beam of the morning; an eye of infinite tenderness and compassion following us throughout the day, knowing the way that we take?\n The world, in its cold vocabulary in the hour of adversity, speaks of \"Providence\"--\"the will of Providence\"--\"the strokes of Providence.\" PROVIDENCE! what is that?\n Why dethrone a living, directing God from the sovereignty of His own earth? Why substitute an inanimate, death-like abstraction, in place of an acting, controlling, personal Jehovah?\n How it would take the sting from many a goading trial, to see what Job saw (in his hour of aggravated woe, when every earthly hope lay prostrate at his feet)--no hand but the Divine. He saw that hand behind the gleaming swords of the Sabeans--he saw it behind the lightning flash--he saw it giving wings to the careening tempest--he saw it in the awful silence of his rifled home.\n \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord!\"\n Thus seeing God in everything, his faith reached its climax when this once powerful prince of the desert, seated on his bed of ashes, could say, \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust him.\" --Macduff.\n 　 四月二十二日\n “他知道我所行的路”（伯二十三：10）。\n 　　信徒哪！这是何等靠得住的事实！你的路——不管是曲是直，是窄是宽，是崎岖是平坦——他都知道。他是全能的神，指导我们的脚步有时向着玛拉，有时向着以琳。\n 　　路不一定尽都是易行，但在出埃及黑暗的路口，神供给以色列子民以云柱和火柱，吗哪和甘泉，炉子里燃烧着烈火，我们不仅仅能信靠那点火的人，并且我们可以断定烈火不是用来烧毁我们，乃是用来锻炼我们，锻炼过程中迟早完成之后，我们将成精金。\n 　　人们认为神离我们很远的时候，他却最接近我们。“我的灵在我里面发昏的时候，你知道我的道路”（诗一四二：3）。\n 　　你可知道，神比太阳最光辉的辐射还要光明，早晨他以荣光唤醒我们，整天以慈爱和温柔的视线，照着我们，知道我们要走的道路。你明白这道理吗？\n 　　世人在患难的时候，往往空洞地喊着“天意”一词。何谓天意？为什么放弃了活的神，放弃了有生命的耶和华，代之以空洞无生命的所谓天意！\n 　　我们如果能像约伯一样，在灾难中间，只看见神的手，我们的试炼就会变得轻松了。约伯在示巴人的刀剑后面，在天上降下的火后面，在旷野刮来的狂风后面，都看见神的手。\n 　　“赏赐的是耶和华，收取的也是耶和华；耶和华的名是应当称颂的”（伯一：21）。\n 　　约伯在每一件事情上看见神，所以他能在炉火中说：“他虽杀我，我还要信靠他”（伯十三：15直译）。——马克特夫\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5048.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
