Gave him something good to eat, and put him to sleep. Elijah had done splendid work, and had run alongside of the chariot in his excitement, and it had been too much for his physical strength, and the reaction had come on, and he was depressed. The physical needed to be cared for. What many people want is sleep, and the physical ailment attended to. There are grand men and women who get where Elijah was━under the juniper tree! and it comes very soothingly to such to hear the words of the Master: “The journey is too great for thee, and I am going to refresh you.” Let us not confound physical weariness with spiritual weakness. ━Selected\\n\\n “I’m too tired to trust and too tired to pray,\\n\\n Said one, as the over-taxed strength gave way.\\n\\n The one conscious thought by my mind possessed,\\n\\n Is, oh, could I just drop it all and rest.”\\n\\n “Will God forgive me, do you suppose,\\n\\n If I go right to sleep as a baby goes,\\n\\n Without an asking if I may,\\n\\n Without ever trying to trust and pray?”\\n\\n “Will God forgive you? why think, dear heart,\\n\\n When language to you was an unknown art,\\n\\n Did a mother deny you needed rest,\\n\\n Or refuse to pillow your head on her breast?”\\n\\n “Did she let you want when you could not ask?\\n\\n Did she set her child an unequal task?\\n\\n Or did she cradle you in her arms,\\n\\n And then guard your slumber against alarms?”\\n\\n “Ah, how quick was her mother love to see,\\n\\n The unconscious yearnings of infancy.\\n\\n When you‘ve grown too tired to trust and pray,\\n\\n When over-wrought nature has quite given way:\\n\\n “Then just drop it all, and give up to rest,\\n\\n As you used to do on a mother\u0027s breast,\\n\\n He knows all about it-the dear Lord knows,\\n\\n So just go to sleep as a baby goes;”\\n\\n “Without even asking if you may,\\n\\n God knows when His child is too tired to pray.\\n\\n He judges not solely by uttered prayer,\\n\\n He knows when the yearnings of love are there.”\\n\\n “He knows you do pray, He know you do trust,\\n\\n And He knows, too, the limits of poor weak dust,\\n\\n Oh, the wonderful sympathy of Christ,\\n\\n For His chosen ones in that midnight tryst,”\\n\\n “When He bade them sleep and take their rest,\\n\\n While on Him the guilt of the whole world pressed—\\n\\n You’ve given your life up to Him to keep,\\n\\n Then don’t be afraid to go right to sleep.” \\n\\n 十二月二十三日 \\n\\n “你当走的路甚远。 （王上十九：7）\\n\\n 　　神怎样对待他疲乏的仆人？给他好东西吃，给他甜蜜睡眠。以利亚曾行了奇妙的神迹，曾奔在亚哈的车子前头，所以他的身体非常疲惫；疲惫的反应就是受压。在这里我们看见：身体的保重是必需的。今天许多神的仆人所缺乏的都是睡眠和调养。有许多属灵的伟人都像以利亚一般━在罗腾树下求死！啊，听哪，这声调何等甘甜：“你当走的路甚远，起来吃吧！”━选 \\n\\n 有人在操劳过度后说道:\\n\\n 我已倦得无力信靠和祷告,\\n\\n 我心中存着一个有意识的念头,\\n\\n 啊!我能不能丢开一切而安睡!\\n\\n 你是否想神会不会原谅我,\\n\\n 假如我就像婴孩似的睡眠,\\n\\n 不问一声可不可以让我这样做,\\n\\n 根本不去试试信靠和祷告?\\n\\n 神会不会原谅你?你必这样想,\\n\\n 在你还不会讲话的幼年,\\n\\n 母亲难道不给你所需的休息,\\n\\n 或着拒绝你靠着她怀中安眠!\\n\\n 你不会发问时,她会让你缺乏吗?\\n\\n 她曾否叫孩子做不能胜任的事情?\\n\\n 她岂不曾把你抱在臂弯里,\\n\\n 守护着安睡,不受震惊?\\n\\n 母爱是多么的敏锐,\\n\\n 她洞察婴儿不自觉的愿望。 \\n\\n 当你倦得无力信靠和祷告,\\n\\n 当你身体操劳过度而疲乏。 \\n\\n 你就把一切丢开,安心休息,\\n\\n 像从前那样,靠在母亲怀中,\\n\\n 祂知道你,亲爱的主知道一切,\\n\\n 你只管像婴孩似的睡觉。 \\n\\n 你无需去问可以不可以,\\n\\n 祂知道祂孩子疲倦无力祷告。 \\n\\n 祂不仅凭有声的祷告来判断,\\n\\n 何处有爱的渴望,祂都知道。\\n\\n 祂也知道能力微弱的肉身,\\n\\n 对于和祂在午夜相会的选民,\\n\\n 基督俱有多么奇妙的同情。 \\n\\n 当祂唤他们去睡觉去休息,\\n\\n 其时全世界的罪恶都由祂承挑,\\n\\n 你已把你的生命交给祂保护,\\n\\n 只管去睡觉,用不着心焦。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5592.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
