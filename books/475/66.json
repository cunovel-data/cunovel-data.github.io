Well, in the first place, it shows His all-sufficient strength and grace much better than if we were exempt from pressure and trial. \"The treasure is in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.\" \n \n It makes us more conscious of our dependence upon Him. God is constantly trying to teach us our dependence, and to hold us absolutely in His hand and hanging upon His care. \n \n This was the place where Jesus Himself stood and where He wants us to stand, not with self-constituted strength, but with a hand ever leaning upon His, and a trust that dare not take one step alone. It teaches us trust. \n \n There is no way of learning faith except by trial. It is God\u0027s school of faith, and it is far better for us to learn to trust God than to enjoy life. \n \n The lesson of faith once learned, is an everlasting acquisition and an eternal fortune made; and without trust even riches will leave us poor. --Days of Heaven upon Earth. \n \n \"Why must I weep when others sing? \n \n \u0027To test the deeps of suffering.\u0027 \n \n Why must I work while others rest? \n \n \u0027To spend my strength at God\u0027s request.\u0027 \n \n Why must I lose while others gain? \n \n \u0027To understand defeat\u0027s sharp pain.\u0027 \n \n Why must this lot of life be mine \n \n When that which fairer seems is thine? \n \n \u0027Because God knows what plans for me \n \n Shall blossom in eternity.\u0027\" \n \n 　 三月七日 \n \n “我们…周围遭患难”（林后七：5）。 \n \n 　　为什么神这样带领我们，应许患难一直临到我们？第一，神够用的恩典和能力可以彰显得完全，远胜在安逸中。“我们有这宝贝放在瓦器里，要显明这莫大的能力，是出于神，不是出于我们”（林后四：7）。 \n \n 　　第二，患难使我们更依靠神。神一直在教导我们依靠他，让他把我们紧握在手中，把所有的难处交给他，由他照顾。 \n \n 　　第三，主自己曾站过那“四围遭患难”之地，今天他也要我们去经历；并不用自己的力，乃是一直用手拉住他依靠他不敢独自跨前一步。用以训练我们的信心。 \n \n 　　第四，除了在患难中，没有别的地方可以学习信心的功课。四周遭患难之地是神所设立的信心学校，在那里我们受到信心的训练。 \n \n 　　信心的秘诀一次学会，就永远会了，并且是一个永远的幸福；有信，贫穷变为富足；没有信，富足也是贫穷。——译自地上的天上生活 \n \n 别人欢唱，我为何悲哭？ \n \n “为了探测苦海的深度。” \n \n 别人休息，我为何工作？ \n \n “为了出力完成神的吩咐。” \n \n 别人获得，我为何损失？ \n \n “为了体验失败的惨痛。” \n \n 美好的幸福为你所有， \n \n 为何厄运偏纠缠我，自朝至暮？ \n \n “因为神知道如此的安排， \n \n 将使我在永恒中获得无上丰富。” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5002.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
