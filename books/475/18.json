{"id":14975,"no":18,"title":"January 18","content":"\"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ.\"(2 Cor. 2:14) \\n\\n \\n\\n God gets His greatest victories out of apparent defeats. Very often the enemy seems to triumph for a little, and God lets it be so; but then He comes in and upsets all the work of the enemy, overthrows the apparent victory, and as the Bible says, \"turns the way of the wicked upside down.\" (Ps.146:9) Thus He gives a great deal larger victory than we would have known if He had not allowed the enemy, seemingly, to triumph in the first place. \\n\\n \\n\\n The story of the three Hebrew children being cast into the fiery furnace is a familiar one. Here was an apparent victory for the enemy. It looked as if the servants of the living God were going to have a terrible defeat. We have all been in places where it seemed as though we were defeated, and the enemy rejoiced. We can imagine what a complete defeat this looked to be. They fell down into the flames, and their enemies watched them to see them burn up in that awful fire, but were greatly astonished to see them walking around in the fire enjoying themselves. Nebuchadnezzar told them to \"come forth out of the midst of the fire.\" Not even a hair was singed, nor was the smell of fire on their garments, \"because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.\"(Dan.3:29) \\n\\n \\n\\n This apparent defeat resulted in a marvelous victory. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suppose that these three men had lost their faith and courage, and had complained, saying, \"Why did not God keep us out of the furnace!\" They would have been burned, and God would not have been glorified. If there is a great trial in your life today, do not own it as a defeat, but continue, by faith, to claim the victory through Him who is able to make you more than conqueror, and a glorious victory will soon be apparent. Let us learn that in all the hard places God brings us into, He is making opportunities for us to exercise such faith in Him as will bring about blessed results and greatly glorify His name. ━Life of Praise \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Defeat may serve as well as victory \\n\\n \\n\\n To shake the soul and let the glory out. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the great oak is straining in the wind, \\n\\n \\n\\n The boughs drink in new beauty, and the trunk \\n\\n \\n\\n Sends down a deeper root on the windward side. \\n\\n \\n\\n Only the soul that knows the mighty grief \\n\\n \\n\\n Can know the mighty rapture. Sorrows come \\n\\n \\n\\n To stretch out spaces in the heart for joy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 一月十八日 \\n\\n \\n\\n 　“感谢神，常帅领我们在基督里夸胜”（林后二：14） \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　在人显著的失败中，神得着最完全的胜利。许多时侯，仇敌似乎得胜了，神也容让牠得胜；可是后来神终究铲除牠所有的作为，推翻牠显著的胜利，一如经上所说，“使恶人的道路颠倒”（诗篇一四六：9）。如果神不让仇敌先得势，神就不能给我们一个更大更可夸的得胜。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　三个希伯来人被掷入火窑的故事，是一个很好的例子。这里，仇敌显然胜利了。按事情看来，永活神的仆人将陷于一败涂地的光景中了。（许多时侯，我们也有这样失败的光景，同时仇敌真是欢喜。）他们跌在火焰中，他们的仇敌盼望看他们在可怕的火焰中顷刻之间化成飞灰，万想不到这三个希伯来人竟在火窑中游行自娱。这真使仇敌吃惊不小。尼布甲尼撒王叫他们从火中出来，甚至一根头发也没有烧焦，一块布也没有变色，也没有一些火燎的气味，“因为没有别神能这样施行拯救” （但三：29） \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　显著的失败的结果，反是希奇的胜利。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　假定这三个希伯来人失去了信心和勇气，在受困之时怨神说： “为什么神不救我们脱离火窑呢？”他们定规会被火烧死，神也得不着荣耀了。亲爱的，今天在你的生活中若是正有一个极大的试炼，不要气馁，自认失败，仍要继续用信心藉着那能使你得胜有余的主宣告胜利，荣耀的胜利立刻就要来了。我们应当知道：在一切神应许我们进入的艰难中，神在替我们造成机会，使我们在祂里面学习信心的功课，藉着主基督夸胜，大大荣耀祂自己的名。 ━译自赞美的生命 \\n\\n \\n\\n 失败可能与胜利同样微妙， \\n\\n \\n\\n 受憾的灵魂成就了荣耀， \\n\\n \\n\\n 你看狂风中挣扎的橡树， \\n\\n \\n\\n 在那挡风的一面，受压的树身， \\n\\n \\n\\n 它的根却向地下长得更深更稳。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 唯有经历过极大的悲痛， \\n\\n \\n\\n 纔能领会极大的欢欣， \\n\\n \\n\\n 忧患给心灵打开喜悦之门。 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4839.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
