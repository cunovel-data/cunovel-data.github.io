The wind lifts the ship up to higher heights. Where did they learn that? They learned it from the birds. If a bird is flying for pleasure, it goes with the wind. But if the bird meets danger, it turns right around and faces the wind, in order that it may rise higher; and it flies away towards the very sun.\\n\\n Sufferings are God\u0027s winds, His contrary winds, sometimes His strong winds. They are God\u0027s hurricanes, but, they take human life and lift it to higher levels and toward God\u0027s heavens.\\n\\n You have seen in the summer time a day when the atmosphere was so oppressive that you could hardly breathe? But a cloud appeared on the western horizon and that cloud grew larger and threw out rich blessing for the world. The storm rose, lightning flashed and thunder pealed. The storm covered the world, and the atmosphere was cleansed; new life was in the air, and the world was changed.\\n\\n Human life is worked out according to exactly the same principle. When the storm breaks the atmosphere is changed, clarified, filled with new life; and a part of heaven is brought down to earth. ━Selected\\n\\n Obstacles ought to set us singing. The wind finds voice, not when rushing across the open sea, but when hindered by the outstretched arms of the pine trees, or broken by the fine strings of an Aeolian harp. Then it has songs of power and beauty. Set your freed soul sweeping across the obstacles of life, through grim forests of pain, against even the tiny hindrances and frets that love uses, and it, too, will find its singing voice. ━Selected\\n\\n \"Be like a bird that, halting in its flight,\\n\\n Rests on a bough too slight.\\n\\n And feeling it give way beneath him sings,\\n\\n Knowing he hath wings.\"\\n\\n 二月四日\\n\\n “耶和华要使你乘驾地的高处” （赛五十八：14）\\n\\n 　　熟习航空的人告诉我们：他们初习的时候，常是逆风驾驶。逆风会把飞机抬得高些。这个秘诀，他们是从甚么地方学来的呢？他们从鸟类那里学来的。如果一只鸟儿正飞着玩，牠就随风而飞。如果遇见了危险，牠就立刻转过身来，面向风飞；这样，牠可以飞得高些。向着太阳直飞。\\n\\n 　　人生的逆境，是神给你的逆风，它们能抬你到最高级的━属天的━生活去。这就是“耶和华要使你乘驾地的高处”的方法。让我们作一个带响弦的风筝，在神的风中越飘越高，同时发出最好听的音乐━赞美━来以悦神耳。\\n\\n 　　你有没有经历过：夏日空气热闷的时候，有时竟连气也会透不过来。但在西方的天空，出现了一朵云，跟踵而至。暴风雨掩盖了这世界，给这世界带来了无穷的舒适，空气也澄清了，气象为之一新，世界是改观了。\\n\\n 　　人生也完全一样的道理。当暴风雨来临的时候，环境可能起了恶劣的变化，但它能发生澄清的作用，充满了新的气象，好象天堂的一角也被带到地上来了。━选\\n\\n 　　障碍应该使我们欢唱。风之能发生曼妙的声响，并不在海洋上畅行无阻的时候，而是在艰难地吹过层层枝叶交织的松树林间，或是吹到“爱奥良”琴的弦上，起了阻抗作用的时候。在上面这些场合，风才发出有力和美丽的音韵。释放你的灵魂，让它横扫生命的障碍，穿过痛苦的可怖森林，小至微细的磨折和烦恼，那么你的灵魂，也会唱出它的歌声了。━选\\n\\n 像一只停飞的小鸟，\\n\\n 栖息在细细的树梢，\\n\\n 歌唱时抖抖下垂，\\n\\n 我有翅膀，不必烦恼。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4798.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
