{"id":15283,"no":326,"title":"November 22","content":"“Believe ye that I am able to do this?”(Matt.9:28)\n God deals with impossibilities. It is never too late for Him to do so, when the impossible is brought to Him, in full faith, by the one in whose life and circumstances the impossible must be accomplished if God is to be glorified. If in our own life there have been rebellion, unbelief, sin, and disaster, it is never too late for God to deal triumphantly with these tragic facts if brought to Him in full surrender and trust. It has often been said, and with truth, that Christianity is the only religion that can deal with man\u0027s past. God can \"restore the years that the locust hath eaten\" (Joel 2:25); and He will do this when we put the whole situation and ourselves unreservedly and believingly into His hands. Not because of what we are but because of what He is. God forgives and heals and restores. He is \"the God of all grace.\"(1 Pet.5:10) Let us praise Him and trust Him. ━Sunday School Times \n \"Nothing is too hard for Jesus\n No man can work like Him.\"\n \"We have a God who delights in impossibilities.\" Nothing too hard for Me. \n ━Andrew Murray \n 十一月二十二日 \n 「你们信我能作这事么？」 （太九:28） \n 我们的神是专门对付「不可能」的神。在祂是没有「太迟的」。一件不可能的事带到祂面前来，只要是用完全的信心带来的，总是有办法的。许多生活上、环境上的「不可能」，都是为要叫神得着荣耀。如果在我们已往的生活上，有了叛逆、不信、罪恶、不幸，只要我们肯完全降服、信靠，神决不会说「太迟」的，因为神有办法对付这些悲剧。常有人说基督教是惟一能对付人已往的宗教；这话是眞实的。神能「将蝗虫….所吃的那些年补还」（珥二:25，直译）；当我们把环境和自己完全用信心丝毫不留地交在祂手里的时候，祂必补还我们以前失败的那些年日。这并不是因着我们，乃是因着祂自己。神是赦免的神、医治的神、补还的神、「赐诸般恩典的神」（彼前五:10）。让我们赞美祂、信靠祂罢！\n ━译自主日学报 \n 没有甚么事会使耶稣觉得太难, \n 也没有甚么人能像耶稣那样苦干。 \n 我们有一位神，是专门对付「不可能」的。在祂没有「太难」。━慕安得烈\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5561.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
