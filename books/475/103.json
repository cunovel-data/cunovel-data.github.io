{"id":15060,"no":103,"title":"April 13","content":"\"And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth unto the plain, and I will there talk with thee.\" (Ezek. 3:22) Did you ever hear of any one being much used for Christ who did not have some special waiting time, some complete upset of all his or her plans first; from St. Paul\u0027s being sent off into the desert of Arabia for three years, when he must have been boiling over with the glad tidings, down to the present day? You were looking forward to telling about trusting Jesus in Syria; now He says, \"I want you to show what it is to trust Me, without waiting for Syria.\" My own case is far less severe, but the same in principle, that when I thought the door was flung open for me to go with a bound into literary work, it is opposed, and doctor steps in and says, simply, \"Never! She must choose between writing and living; she can\u0027t do both.\" That was in 1860. Then I came out of the shell with \"Ministry of Song\" in 1869, and saw the evident wisdom of being kept waiting nine years in the shade. God\u0027s love being unchangeable, He is just as loving when we do not see or feel His love. Also His love and His sovereignty are co-equal and universal; so He withholds the enjoyment and conscious progress because He knows best what will really ripen and further His work in us. --Memorials of Frances Ridley Havergal. I laid it down in silence, This work of mine, And took what had been sent me-- A resting time. The Master\u0027s voice had called me To rest apart; \"Apart with Jesus only,\" Echoed my heart. I took the rest and stillness From His own Hand, And felt this present illness Was what He planned. How often we choose labor, When He says \"Rest\"-- Our ways are blind and crooked; His way is best. The work Himself has given, He will complete. There may be other errands For tired feet; There may be other duties For tired hands, The present, is obedience To His commands. There is a blessed resting In lying still, In letting His hand mould us, Just as He will. His work must be completed. His lesson set; He is the higher Workman: Do not forget! It is not only \"working.\" We must be trained; And Jesus \"learnt\" obedience, Through suffering gained. For us, His yoke is easy, His burden light. His discipline most needful, And all is right. We are but under-workmen; They never choose If this tool or if that one Their hands shall use. In working or in waiting May we fulfill Not ours at all, but only The Master\u0027s will! --Selected. God provides resting places as well as working places. Rest, then, and be thankful when He brings you, wearied to a wayside well. 　 　 四月十三日 “耶和华的手在那里降在我身上，他对我说，你起来往平原去，我要在那里和你说话”（结三：22）。 　　使徒保罗在亚拉伯的沙漠中，历时三年，在那时期中，他心中为主传福音的火充溢。故自古以来，我们常常可以从任何一位被基督所重用的仆人看见，他们自己的计划往往整个地推翻，且经过了一段特殊的等待时间。 　　你瞻望着到了叙利亚之后，再懂得信靠耶稣，现在他说：“我要你无需等到叙利亚，就表示信靠我是什么意思。” 　　我的等待情形，远不及保罗那样严重，原则却有相通的道理，当我以为职业之门已给我打开，欢迎我投入文学工作时，却被阻挡了，有一位先进直截了当地表示：“绝对不行，她必须在写作和谋生之间作一选择，两者不能兼得。” 　　那是主历一八六〇年，到了一八六九年，我的“歌之使命”问世，了解了在韬光隐晦中，等待了九年，确有主明智的道理。神的爱是不变的，当我们看不见或觉不到他的爱时，他还是一样的爱我们。他的爱和他的能力，是对等而交相为用的，他阻止我们享乐，不要我们自以为进步，因为我们究竟是否真正成熟，以及如何策励我们，他知道得最清楚。——海弗格 我默默搁下自己的事务， 接受他给我暂作休息的吩咐， 主亲口唤我单独默想， 我心中应着说，愿与主单独相处。 我从他手中取得休息与宁静， 才知他为何给我安排目前的不幸， 我们常在他吩咐休息时偏要劳动， 何等盲目迂回，他所指示的才是最佳路径。 他安排的工作，他会完成， 也许有别的任务， 要劳累你疲倦的手足， 现在只要你遵从他的吩咐。 宁静地躺着，享受他慈爱的眷顾， 让他的手塑造我们的模样， 他的工作和教训终必完成， 别忘记他是最高明的艺匠。 我们不仅要作工，还要受训练； 救主耶稣之顺从，出自痛苦经历中， 他给我们的负的轭何等轻省， 他的教导如此切实，一切都成全。 我们仅是做助手的小工人， 不可去挑剔工具之良窳， 无论在工作或等待之时， 要让主的旨意来显明。 　神给我们准备了工作的界限，和休息的所在，因此我们在极其疲乏时，他带领我们到路旁的井边，你当该歇息，并将赞美感谢归给主。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5039.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
