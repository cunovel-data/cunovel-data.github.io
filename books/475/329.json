And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times\" (2 Kings 13:18-19) \\n\\n How striking and eloquent the message of these words! Jehoash thought he had done very well when he duplicated and triplicated what to him was certainly an extraordinary act of faith. But the Lord and the prophet were bitterly disappointed because he had stopped half way.\\n\\n He got something. He got much. He got exactly what he believed for in the final test, but he did not get all that the prophet meant and the Lord wanted to bestow. He missed much of the meaning of the promise and the fullness of the blessing. He got something better than the human, but he did not get God\u0027s best.\\n\\n Beloved, how solemn is the application! How heartsearching the message of God to us! How important that we should learn to pray through! Shall we claim all the fullness of the promise and all the possibilities of believing prayer?━A. B. Simpson\\n\\n \"Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think\" (Eph. 3:20)\\n\\n There is no other such piling up of words in Paul\u0027s writings as these, \"exceeding abundantly above all,\" and each word is packed with infinite love and power to \"do\" for His praying saints. There is one limitation, \"according to the power that worketh in us.\" He will do just as much for us as we let Him do in us. The power that saved us, washed us with His own blood, filled us with might by His Spirit, kept us in manifold temptations, will work for us, meeting every emergency, every crisis, every circumstance, and every adversary. ━The Alliance \\n\\n 十一月二十五日\\n\\n 「取几枝箭来…打地罢。他打了三次，便止住了。神人向他发怒，说，应当击打五、六次。」\\n\\n (王下十三:18-19） \\n\\n 这几句话的信息多么警惕！约阿施自以为打了二次、三次，已经很有信心了。但是神和神人都大失望。\\n\\n 约阿施曾得到一些东西，并且得的不少━他所得的，和他所信的，适正相符；但是他没有得到神所要给他的一切。他失了许多应许和祝福。他得了一些比别人好的东西，可是他没有得到神的最好。 \\n\\n 亲爱的，这是多么严重的一件事！我们应当学习祷告得透切！━宣信\\n\\n 「充充足足的成就一切超过我们所求所想的。」（弗三20）\\n\\n 让我们看保罗所用的字句━「充充足足」、「一切」、「超过」…啊！每一个字里面包含着神无限的爱和能 力！━宣道会报\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5564.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
