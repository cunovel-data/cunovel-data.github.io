In crossing the Atlantic we observed this very principle of faith. We saw no path upon the sea, nor sign of the shore. And yet day by day we were marking our path upon the chart as exactly as if there had followed us a great chalk line upon the sea. And when we came within twenty miles of land, we knew where we were as exactly as if we had seen it all three thousand miles ahead. \\n\\n How had we measured and marked our course? Day by day our captain had taken his instruments and, looking up to the sky, had fixed his course by the sun. He was sailing by the heavenly, not the earthly lights.\\n\\n So faith looks up and sails on, by God\u0027s great Sun, not seeing one shore line or earthly lighthouse or path upon the way. Often its steps seem to lead into utter uncertainty, and even darkness and disaster; but He opens the way, and often makes such midnight hours the very gates of day. Let us go forth this day, not knowing, but trusting.--Days of Heaven upon Eart\\n\\n \"Too many of us want to see our way through before starting new enterprises. If we could and did, from whence would come the development of our Christian graces? Faith, hope and love cannot be plucked from trees, like ripe apples. After the words \u0027In the beginning\u0027 comes the word \u0027God\u0027! The first step turns the key into God\u0027s power-house, and it is not only true that God helps those who help themselves, but He also helps those who cannot help themselves. You can depend upon Him every time.\" \\n\\n \"Waiting on God brings us to our journey\u0027s end quicker than our feet.\" \\n\\n The opportunity is often lost by deliberation--Selected. \\n\\n 八月二十三日\\n\\n 「亚伯拉罕因着信，蒙召的时候，就遵命出去，往将来要得为业的地方去。出去的时候，还不知往那里去。」（来十一8）\\n\\n 这就是不凭眼见的信心。凡凭眼见的，就不是凭信心，乃是凭理由了。轮船横渡大西洋，也是本着信心的原则的。我们在海面上看不见甚么途径，看不见甚么海岸，我们却能一天过一天地在航海图上画着标号，当轮船前行了若干哩的时候，我们立刻就会知道我们已经到了甚么地方。\\n\\n 但是，我们是怎样来测量我们所画的行程的呢？我们的船主每天拿着他的测量器，望着天，借着太阳来规定他的行程。他是借着天上的光━不是地上的光━来航行的。\\n\\n 信心也是这样航行的━望着天，借着神的光；虽然并没有看见航线、灯塔、或者途径。许多时候，信心的脚步似乎牵引我们进入了黑暗和灾祸，但是神开了路，夜半变成了黎明。让我们今天也这样前行罢━不是因着知道，乃是因着相信。－－译自地上的天上生活\\n\\n 我们中间有许多人常常要先看清路程，纔肯起行。这样，怎能在基督里有长进呢？信、望、爱，是不能像长熟的苹果那样从树上摘下来的。创世记一章一节「起初」后面接着就说「神」。神是全能的，神不单引领那自己帮助自己的人，神也引领那自己不能帮助自己的人，你只要全心倚赖祂就是了。\\n\\n 良好的机会，常是因审慎过度失去的。－－选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5319.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
