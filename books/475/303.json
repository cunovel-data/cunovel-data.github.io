{"id":15260,"no":303,"title":"October 30","content":"\"Let us run with patience\" (Heb. 12:1)\n O run with patience is a very difficult thing. Running is apt to suggest the absence of patience, the eagerness to reach the goal. We commonly associate patience with lying down. We think of it as the angel that guards the couch of the invalid. Yet, I do not think the invalid\u0027s patience the hardest to achieve.\n There is a patience which I believe to be harder--the patience that can run. To lie down in the time of grief, to be quiet under the stroke of adverse fortune, implies a great strength; but I know of something that implies a strength greater still: It is the power to work under a stroke; to have a great weight at your heart and still to run; to have a deep anguish in your spirit and still perform the daily task. It is a Christlike thing!\n Many of us would nurse our grief without crying if we were allowed to nurse it. The hard thing is that most of us are called to exercise our patience, not in bed, but in the street. We are called to bury our sorrows, not in lethargic quiescence, but in active service━in the exchange, in the workshop, in the hour of social intercourse, in the contribution to another\u0027s joy. There is no burial of sorrow so difficult as that; it is the \"running with patience.\"\n This was Thy patience, O Son of man! It was at once a waiting and a running--a waiting for the goal, and a doing of the lesser work meantime. I see Thee at Cana turning the water into wine lest the marriage feast should be clouded. I see Thee in the desert feeding a multitude with bread just to relieve a temporary want. All, all the time, Thou wert bearing a mighty grief, unshared, unspoken. Men ask for a rainbow in the cloud; but I would ask more from Thee. I would be, in my cloud, myself a rainbow--a minister to others\u0027 joy. My patience will be perfect when it can work in the vineyard. ━George Matheson \n \"When all our hopes are gone,\n \u0027Tis well our hands must keep toiling on\n For others \u0027 sake:\n For strength to bear is found in duty done;\n And he is best indeed who learns to make\n The joy of others cure his own heartache. \"\n 十月三十日\n 「……存心忍耐，奔……」 （来十二:1）\n 「…..存心忍耐，奔……」是一件非常困难的事情。「奔」的时候，常是缺乏「忍耐」的时候；因为「奔」的时候，常是急急想达到目的的时候。我们平常说起「忍耐」，立刻就会联想到「静止」━一幕天使守护病榻的图画。然而我以为静止的忍耐，并不是最难做到的忍耐。 \n 我相信有一种忍耐，更难做到━就是那同时能「奔」的忍耐。固然，在悲伤的时候不动，在不幸的时候不言，需要极大的忍耐；可是我知道一件事，需要更大的忍耐：就是在袭击之下继续工作━心中负着重压，仍不停止往前「奔」；灵里深感痛苦，仍然勉力尽职。这纔是基督的忍耐！\n 许多时候，神要我们学习忍耐，不是在床上，乃是在街上。神要我们埋葬我们的悲哀，不是在寂静中，乃是在活动中━在贸易中、在工场中、在交际的时候、在帮助别人的时候。没有一种埋葬比这种埋葬更难；可是这就是所谓 「……存心忍耐，奔……」\n 哦，人子阿，这就是祢的忍耐！这就是又等又奔的忍耐！虽然祢没有一刻不背负着极大的忧伤，可是我看见祢仍在迦拿变水为酒，在野地变饼济众。人们都向祢求云中虹；我要向祢求更大的：求祢叫我作一条云中的虹━一条叫别人喜乐的虹！━马德胜 \n 当我们丧失了一切希望，\n 最好继续为别人操劳，\n 助人能获得更大更坚强的力量，\n 最聪明的人必能懂得，\n 以别人的快乐，医治自己的悲伤。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5538.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
