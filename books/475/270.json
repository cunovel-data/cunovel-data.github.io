It is the life of Christ in the frame. It is the union of our members with the very body of Christ and the inflowing life of Christ in our living members. It is as real as His risen and glorified body. It is as reasonable as the fact that He was raised from the dead and is a living Man with a true body and a rational soul today at God\u0027s right hand. \\n\\n That living Christ belongs to us in all His attributes and powers. We are members of His body, His flesh and His bones, and if we can only believe and receive it, we may live upon the very life of the Son of God. Lord, help me to know \"the Lord for the body and the body for the Lord.\u0027(1 Cor.6:13) --A. B. Simpson \\n\\n \"The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty.\" (Zeph. 3:17). This was the text that first flashed the truth of Divine healing into my mind and worn-out body nearly a quarter century ago. It is still the door, wide open more than ever, through which the living Christ passes moment by moment into my redeemed body, filling, energizing, vitalizing it with the presence and power of His own personality, turning my whole being into a \"new heaven and new earth.\"(Reve.21:1) \"The Lord, thy God.\" Thy God. My God. Then all that is in God Almighty is mine and in me just as far as I am able and willing to appropriate Him and all that belongs to Him. This God, \"Mighty,\" ALL Mighty God, is our INSIDE God. He is, as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in the midst of me, just as really as the sun is in the center of the heavens, or like the great dynamo in the center of the power-house of my three-fold being. He is in the midst, at the center of my physical being. He is in the midst of my brain. He is in the midst of my nerve centers. \\n\\n For twenty-one years it has been not only a living reality to me, but a reality growing deeper and richer, until now at the age of seventy years, I am in every sense a younger, fresher man than I was at thirty. At this present time I am in the strength of God, doing full twice as much work, mental and physical, as I have ever done in the best days of the past, and this observe, with less than half the effort then necessary. My life, physical, mental and spiritual, is like an artesian well--always full, overflowing. To speak, teach, travel by night and day in all weather and through all the sudden and violent changes of our variable climate, is no more effort to me than it is for the mill-wheel to turn when the stream is full or for the pipe to let the water run through. --Selected\\n\\n My body, soul and spirit thus redeemed,\\n\\n Sanctified and healed I give, O Lord, to Thee,\\n\\n A consecrated offering Thine ever more to be.\\n\\n That all my powers with all their might;\\n\\n In Thy sole glory may unite.━Halleluijah!\\n\\n --Dr.Henry Wilson \\n\\n 九月二十七日\\n\\n 「我以经得了赎价。」（伯卅三24）\\n\\n 信心医病是信心生活中的一部份。这就是基督在我们身体上掌权。这就是基督的生命在我们身体上活出来。这就是我们身体与基督的身体联合了，基督的生命流到我们身体上来。所以，我们今天所有的，乃是祂升天以后得荣耀的身体。祂从死里复活，今天带着一个复活的身体，坐在神的右边。我们今天所有的，就是那样的身体。\\n\\n 这活着的基督是属于我们的，祂一切的品性和能力也是属于我们的。我们是祂身上的肢体━祂的肉、祂的骨━只要我们能相信、能接受，我们立刻可以活出神儿子的生命来。主阿，求祢使我知道甚么叫做「身体……是为主，主也是为身子。」（林前六13）－－信宣\\n\\n 「在你中间的耶和华你的神是大有能力的」（番三17）。二十余年前把信心医病的眞理照入我心中，叫我破坏的身体得到医治的，就是这节圣经。直到今天，这节圣经仍是一扇门户，大大地开放着，好叫基督时时得进入这买回的身体来，用祂自己的同在和能力充满、浇灌、活动，把我的全人造成一个「新天新地」（启廿一1）。「耶和华你的神！」啊！你的神！我的神！神既是我的，那么在神里面的一切也定规是我的了，定归在我里面了；我能够信多少，我愿意用多少，这是我自己的事。这位神，「大有能力的」神，全能的神，是我们里面的神！这是何等的权利！祂━父、子、灵━在我里面━在我身体里面，在我头脑里面，在我神经里面。 \\n\\n 二十一年以来这不但是我实在的经历，并且是一个日深一日，日丰一日的经历。现在我七十岁了，却比三十岁的时候还健壮、还新鲜。靠着神的力量，我现在体力、上智力，上都负担着常人两倍的工作，却还用不到一半气力。我的体力、智力、灵力，都像喷水井一般━一直是满溢的、泛滥的。无论讲道、教书、日夜旅行，在各种气候下都像管子通水那般容易。－－选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5418.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
