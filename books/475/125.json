There are thousands of things that we wear as shackles which we might use as instruments with music in them, if we only knew how.\\n\\n Those men that ponder, and meditate, and weigh the affairs of life, and study the mysterious developments of God\u0027s providence, and wonder why they should be burdened and thwarted and hampered--how different and how much more joyful would be their lives, if, instead of forever indulging in self-revolving and inward thinking, they would take their experiences, day by day, and lift them up, and praise God for them.\\n\\n We can sing our cares away easier than we can reason them away. Sing in the morning. The birds are the earliest to sing, and birds are more without care than anything else that I know of.\\n\\n Sing at evening. Singing is the last thing that robins do. When they have done their daily work; when they have flown their last flight, and picked up their last morsel of food, then on a topmost twig, they sing one song of praise.\\n\\n Oh, that we might sing morning and evening, and let song touch song all the way through. –Selected.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let the song go out of your life \\n\\n Though it chance sometimes to flow\\n\\n In a minor strain; it will blend again\\n\\n With the major tone you know.\\n\\n \"What though shadows rise to obscure life\u0027s skies,\\n\\n And hide for a time the sun,\\n\\n The sooner they\u0027ll lift and reveal the rift,\\n\\n If you let the melody run.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let the song go out of your life;\\n\\n Though the voice may have lost its trill,\\n\\n Though the tremulous note may die in your throat,\\n\\n Let it sing in your spirit still.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let the song go out of your life;\\n\\n Let it ring in the soul while here;\\n\\n And when you go hence, \u0027twill follow you thence,\\n\\n And live on in another sphere.\"\\n\\n 　 五月五日\\n\\n “众人方唱歌赞美的时候，耶和华就派伏兵击杀…他们就被打败了”（代志下二十：22）。\\n\\n 　　哦，但愿我们少为忧虑操心，多多赞美！一切的事物，对我们的像桎梧，又如枷锁，假若我们知道如何去运动，就都可以成了音韵悦耳的乐器。\\n\\n 　　那些为人生的遭遇，常千思百虑，操心挂念，并且揣测神的旨意如何发展，他们为什么负累重重，遭受挫折和阻碍呢？假若他们不要沉溺于患得患失的内心无谓的筹划中，他们的生活将大为改观，有更多的快乐得着，并承受天天加增的生活经历，喜乐的心，将赞美献给神。\\n\\n 　　也应当在晚间歌唱。知更雀每晚最后一件工作就是歌唱，当它们做完了一天的工作，飞完了最后一次任务，捡起了最后一颗食粮，便停住在树枝的高处，唱出赞美的歌声。\\n\\n 　　哦，巴不得我们早晨也唱，晚间也唱，每天的生活中充满了歌唱赞美！\\n\\n 不要让歌唱脱离你的生活，\\n\\n 有时声调虽然失却铿锵，\\n\\n 如咽如哽，它终会恢复美畅，\\n\\n 响遏行云，婉转绕樑。\\n\\n 即使降云升起，一时遮掩太阳，\\n\\n 蒙蔽了生命的辉煌，\\n\\n 只要你颂赞歌唱，\\n\\n 阴云就会飘散，露出阳光。\\n\\n 不要让歌唱脱离你的生活，\\n\\n 嗓子虽会喑哑不畅，\\n\\n 震颤的音符在喉头阻梗，\\n\\n 你要继续在灵里歌唱。\\n\\n 不要让歌唱脱离你的生活，\\n\\n 在此世上让歌声充满你的灵；\\n\\n 将来它会随你而去，\\n\\n 在另一个世界获得新生。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5114.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
