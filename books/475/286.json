{"id":15243,"no":286,"title":"October 13","content":"\"In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.\"(Phil. 4:6-7)\n No anxiety ought to be found in a believer. Great, many and varied may be our trials, our afflictions, our difficulties, and yet there should be no anxiety under any circumstances, because we have a Father in Heaven who is almighty, who loves His children as He loves His only-begotten Son, and whose very joy and delight it is to succor and help them at all times and under all circumstances. We should attend to the Word, \"In nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\" \n \"In everything,\" that is not merely when the house is on fire, not merely when the beloved wife and children are on the brink of the grave, but in the smallest matters of life, bring everything before God, the little things, the very little things, what the world calls trifling things━everything━living in holy communion with our Heavenly Father, arid with our precious Lord Jesus all day long. And when we awake at night, by a kind of spiritual instinct again turning to Him, and speaking to Him, bringing our various little matters before Him in the sleepless night, the difficulties in connection with the family, our trade, our profession. Whatever tries us in any way, speak to the Lord about it. \n \"By prayer and supplication,\" taking the place of beggars, with earnestness, with perseverance, going on and waiting, waiting, waiting on God. \n \"With thanksgiving.\" We should at all times lay a good foundation with thanksgiving. If everything else were wanting, this is always present, that He has saved us from hell. Then, that He has given us His Holy Word--His Son, His choicest gift━and the Holy Spirit. Therefore we have abundant reason for thanksgiving. O let us aim at this!\n \"And the peace of God which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\" And this is so great a blessing, so real a blessing, so precious a blessing, that it must be known experimentally to be entered into, for it passeth understanding. O let us lay these things to heart, and the result will be, if we habitually walk in this spirit, we shall far more abundantly glorify God, than as yet we have done.━George Mueller, in Life of Trust\n Twice or thrice a day, look to see if your heart is not disquieted about something; and if you find that it is, take care forthwith to restore it to calm.━Francis De Sales \n 十月十三日\n 「应当一无挂虑，只要凡事藉着祷告、祈求和感谢，将你们所要的告诉　神。神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里，保守你们的心怀意念。」（腓四:6-7）\n 一个信徒不该有丝毫挂虑。无论我们的试炼多大，痛苦多深，困难多杂，总不能叫我们有挂虑的理由，因为我们有一位父在天上，祂是全能的，祂爱我们，正如爱祂的独生子一般，祂乐意随时随地救济我们、帮助我们。所以让我们听祂对我们所说的话：「应当一无罣虑，只要凡事藉着祷告、祈求、和感谢，将你们所要的告诉神。神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里，保守你们的心怀意念。」 \n 「凡事」不只是房屋着火，不只是所爱的病危，「凡事」包括日常生活中一切大大小小的事情；我们应当将「凡事」带到神面前去！当我们夜半醒来，辗转不能成眠的时候，就该顶自然地倾向神去，与祂谈话，将我们种种琐碎的事情带到祂面前去━将一切家庭方面、职业方面的困难全告诉祂。\n 「藉着祷告祈求」，站在乞丐的地位上，\n 用诚恳和坚忍来等候祂。\n 「和感谢」，我们应当随时存感谢的心。如果，我们以为没有甚么可叫我们感谢的话，至少有一件事是值得我们感谢的━祂救我们脱离死亡，祂给我们祂的道━祂的儿子━和圣灵。哦，这就够我们大声感谢赞美了。\n 「神所赐出人意外的平安，必在基督耶稣里，保守你们的心怀意念。」这是一个何等大、何等真、何等宝贵的祝福！但是这个祝福必须亲身经历纔会知道，因为这是出人意外的。哦，让我们把这些话放在心上。如果我们能一直照着行的话，结果定会叫神得到更大的荣耀。━莫勒（信靠的生活）\n 我们应当时时察看自己有没有甚么叫我的心得不到安息？就当立刻到神前去对付，直到恢复了内心的镇静。\n ━赛尔斯\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5521.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
