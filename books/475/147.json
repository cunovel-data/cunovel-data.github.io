{"id":15104,"no":147,"title":"May 27","content":"\"Bring them hither to me.\" (Matt. 14:18)\n Are you encompassed with needs at this very moment, and almost overwhelmed with difficulties, trials, and emergencies? These are all divinely provided vessels for the Holy Spirit to fill, and if you but rightly understood their meaning, they would become opportunities for receiving new blessings and deliverances which you can get in no other way.\n Bring these vessels to God. Hold them steadily before Him in faith and prayer. Keep still, and stop your own restless working until He begins to work. Do nothing that He does not Himself command you to do. Give Him a chance to work, and He will surely do so; and the very trials that threatened to overcome you with discouragement and disaster, will become God\u0027s opportunity for the revelation of His grace and glory in your life, as you have never known Him before. \"Bring them (all needs) to me.\" --A. B. Simpson.\n \"My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.\" (Phil. 4:19)\n What a source--\"God!\" What a supply--\"His riches in glory!\" What a channel--\"Christ Jesus!\" It is your sweet privilege to place all your need over against His riches, and lose sight of the former in the presence of the latter. His exhaustless treasury is thrown open to you, in all the love of His heart; go and draw upon it, in the artless simplicity of faith, and you will never have occasion to look to a creature-stream, or lean on a creature-prop. --C. H. M.\n \"MY CUP RUNNETH OVER\"\n There is always something over,\n When we trust our gracious Lord;\n Every cup He fills o\u0027erfloweth,\n His great rivers all are broad.\n Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,\n Ever issues from His store;\n To His own He gives full measure,\n Running over, evermore.\n There is always something over,\n When we, from the Father\u0027s hand,\n Take our portion with thanksgiving,\n Praising for the path He planned.\n Satisfaction, full and deepening,\n Fills the soul, and lights the eye,\n When the heart has trusted Jesus\n All its need to satisfy.\n There is always something over,\n When we tell of all His love;\n Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,\n Unsealed heights rise far above:\n Human lips can never utter\n All His wondrous tenderness,\n We can only praise and wonder,\n And His name forever bless.\n --Margaret E. Barber\n \"How can He but, in giving Him, lavish on us all things.\" (Rom. 8:32)\n 　 五月二十七日\n “拿过来给我”（太十四：18）。\n 　　你现在是不是正被患难，试炼，危险，缺乏所包围呢？这些都是神为你安排的器皿，为着盛满圣灵用的；如果你能懂得神的用意，它们就会作你得新祝福和新拯救的机会；这种祝福和拯救，除此之外，别无他法可得。\n 　　把这些器皿拿过来给神。用信心和祷告带到他面前来。安静罢，停止你自己的活动，除非他有所吩咐。不要作他所没有吩咐你作的事情。给他一个机会去作罢；这样，使你害怕的患难，试炼，危险，缺乏，都要变作神彰显他恩典和荣耀的机会。神吩咐我们：“拿过来给我”。——宣信\n 　　“我的神必照他荣耀的丰富，在基督耶稣里使你们一切所需用的都充足”（腓四：19）\n 　　何等的来源——“神”！何等的宝贝——“他荣耀的丰富”！何等的导管——“基督耶稣”！何等的供给——“一切所需用的”！这是你无上的权利——把你一切所需用的去换他荣耀的丰富！他无尽的宝库，已因他不竭之爱，为你开着了；用无伪的，简单的信心去支取你的需用罢！他绝不会怕你支取得过多的，因为他的宝库从无缺货之虞。——马金都\n “使我的福杯满溢”。（诗二十三：5）\n 信靠了慈爱的主，\n 他会把祝福注入杯中，\n 多得满溢，岂但充满！\n 且波浪滚滚之大江，\n 永不枯竭，绝不缺短，\n 他的赐予从无限止，\n 他给子民丰满的供应，\n 如滔滔的激湍流长源远。\n 我们的杯，将永远充溢不竭，\n 只要我们从天父手边，\n 接受给我们杯中的分，\n 以感激之心赞美他的成全。\n 我衷心信赖了耶稣，\n 灵中注满了完实的欢欣，\n 只有耶稣使我心足意满，\n 一片光明，充沛眼前。\n 只要我们称颂他的爱，\n 我们的杯将永远不竭；\n 他的爱高得无法言喻，\n 那样奇妙的爱，\n 那样温柔的爱，\n 永远称颂他的名，\n 永远称颂他的名，\n 我们赞美，我们欣欢。 ——巴伯\n 　　“神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白的赐给我们吗”？（罗八：32）。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5136.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
