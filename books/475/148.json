{"id":15105,"no":148,"title":"May 28","content":"\"I will not let thee go, except thou bless me ... and he blessed him there.\" (Gen.32:26, 29.)\\n\\n Jacob got the victory and the blessing not by wrestling, but by clinging. His limb was out of joint and he could struggle no longer, but he would not let go. Unable to wrestle, he wound his arms around the neck of his mysterious antagonist and hung all his helpless weight upon him, until at last he conquered.\\n\\n We will not get victory in prayer until we too cease our struggling, giving up our own will and throw our arms about our Father\u0027s neck in clinging faith.\\n\\n What can puny human strength take by force out of the hand of Omnipotence? Can we wrest blessing by force from God? It is never the violence of wilfulness that prevails with God. It is the might of clinging faith, that gets the blessing and the victories. It is not when we press and urge our own will, but when humility and trust unite in saying, \"Not my will, but Thine.\" We are strong with God only in the degree that self is conquered and is dead. Not by wrestling, but by clinging can we get the blessing. --J. R. Miller.\\n\\n An incident from the prayer life of Charles H. Usher (illustrating \"soul-cling\" as a hindrance to prevailing prayer): \"My little boy was very ill. The doctors held out little hope of his recovery. I had used all the knowledge of prayer which I possessed on his behalf, but he got worse and worse. This went on for several weeks.\\n\\n \"One day I stood watching him as he lay in his cot, and I saw that he could not live long unless he had a turn for the better. I said to God, \u0027O God, I have given much time in prayer for my boy and he gets no better; I must now leave him to Thee, and I will give myself to prayer for others. If it is Thy will to take him, I choose Thy will--I surrender him entirely to Thee.\u0027\\n\\n \"I called in my dear wife, and told her what I had done. She shed some tears, but handed him over to God. Two days afterwards a man of God came to see us. He had been very interested in our boy Frank, and had been much in prayer for him.\\n\\n \"He said, \u0027God has given me faith to believe that he will recover--have you faith?\u0027\\n\\n \"I said, \u0027I have surrendered him to God, but I will go again to God regarding him.\u0027 I did; and in prayer I discovered that I had faith for his recovery. From that time he began to get better. It was the \u0027soul-cling\u0027 in my prayers which had hindered God answering; and if I had continued to cling and had been unwilling to surrender him, I doubt if my boy would be with me today.\\n\\n \"Child of God! If you want God to answer your prayers, you must be prepared to follow the footsteps of \u0027our father Abraham,\u0027 even to the Mount of Sacrifice.\" (See Rom. 4:12)\\n\\n 　 五月二十八日\\n\\n “你不给我祝福，我就不容你去……于是在那里给雅各祝福”（创三十二：26，29）。\\n\\n 　　雅各得着祝福，不是因着奋斗乃是因着纠缠。他的大腿窝扭了，不能再摔跤了；但是他缠住对方，不肯放他去。他的腿瘸了，他只能伸出他的手臂来围着对方的颈项，把他全身的重量挂在其上。\\n\\n 　我们祷告，也是这样。什么时候我们停止自己的努力，放弃我们自己的主意，用信心的手臂缠住父的颈项，什么时候我们就会得着答应。\\n\\n 　　微弱的人们能用武力从全能者的手中夺取祝福么？我们的努力会叫神屈服么？决不。顽强决不能从神得到什么。只有不移的信心，完全的依靠，能叫我们得到神的祝福。我们坚强的意志不能帮助我们得到什么，只有谦卑和信靠联合说：“不要…我的意思，只要…你的意思”（路二十二：42）。能帮助我们得到祝福。只有己的死能叫我们与神一同刚强。——密勒\\n\\n 　　有一位乌喧先生说他祷告的经历如后：“我的小儿子病得很重，医生亦说希望甚少。我只有恳切地为这孩子祷告，但这孩子的情况日趋恶化，这样过了多日”。\\n\\n 　　“一天，我站在孩子的病榻之旁，凭我的观察，如无神迹，恐将不治了。所以我祈求在神面前：“神啊；我费了多少时间为这孩子祈祷，并未有什么转机，我现在把他交给你，我将为别人而代祷了；如果你有意思要将孩子带走，我亦接受你的美意——把孩子完完全全交给神”。\\n\\n 　　“我把太太叫来，把事情经过告诉了她。她洒着眼泪，也愿把孩子交给神。两天之后，有一位传教士来看我们，他也很关心孩子，而且常常为他代祷。”\\n\\n 　　他说：“神给我信心，相信这孩子会康复的。你有信心吗”？\\n\\n 　　我说：“我把孩子交给了神，但我将继续祷告。”在祷告中，我发现了对他康复的信心。\\n\\n 　　从此孩子也渐渐地好转，过去因为在祷告中没有排除己意，所以妨碍了神的答复，如果坚持固执己见，不愿将孩子交给神，我想后果堪虑了。\\n\\n 　　“神的孩子们哪！倘使你要神给你回答，必须准备跟从先圣亚伯拉罕的脚踪，先要走上自我牺牲的道路”。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5137.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
