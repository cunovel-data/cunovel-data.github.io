{"id":15046,"no":89,"title":"March 30","content":"\"Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.\" (Isa. 50:11) What a solemn warning to those who walk in darkness and yet who try to help themselves out into the light. They are represented as kindling a fire, and compassing themselves with sparks. What does this mean? Why, it means that when we are in darkness the temptation is to find a way without trusting in the Lord and relying upon Him. Instead of letting Him help us out, we try to help ourselves out. We seek the light of nature, and get the advice of our friends. We try the conclusions of our reason, and might almost be tempted to accept a way of deliverance which would not be of God at all. All these are fires of our own kindling; rushlights that will surely lead us onto the shoals. And God will let us walk in the light of those sparks, but the end will be sorrow. Beloved, do not try to get out of a dark place, except, in God\u0027s time and in God\u0027s way. The time of trouble is meant to teach you lessons that you sorely need. Premature deliverance may frustrate God\u0027s work of grace in your life. Just commit the whole situation to Him. Be willing to abide in darkness so long as you have His presence. Remember that it is better to walk in the dark with God than to walk alone in the light. --The Still Small Voice. Cease meddling with God\u0027s plans and will. You touch anything of His, and you mar the work. You may move the hands of a clock to suit you, but you do not change the time; so you may hurry the unfolding of God\u0027s will, but you harm and do not help the work. You can open a rosebud but you spoil the flower. Leave all to Him. Hands down. Thy will, not mine. --Stephen Merritt. HIS WAY God bade me go when I would stay (\u0027Twas cool within the wood); I did not know the reason why. I heard a boulder crashing by Across the path where I stood. He bade me stay when I would go; \"Thy will be done,\" I said. They found one day at early dawn, Across the way I would have gone, A serpent with a mangled head. No more I ask the reason why, Although I may not see The path ahead, His way I go; For though I know not, He doth know, And He will choose safe paths for me. --The Sunday School Times.　 　 三月三十日 　　“凡你们点火用火把围绕自己的，可以行在你们的火焰里，并你们所点的火把中。这是我手所定的；你们必躺在悲惨之中”(赛五十：11)。 　　这是一个严重的警告，对付那行在黑暗中而想设法自救的人们的。神说他们好象自己点火，用火把围绕自己。这是什么意思呢？ 　　这意思说：当我们在黑暗中遭遇试炼的时侯，我们总想自谋出路，不肯信神靠神。我们本该让他施行拯救，可是我们顶喜欢自己筹划。我们寻求理由的结论，亲友的劝告。结果，就会采纳一个不出于神的方法。这些都是我们自己点的火焰和火把，凡匆促的引导，必定会把我们引导错误入了歧途，若想这种光亮前进，结果却是悲惨。 　　所以，亲爱的，不要想用自己的谋算逃出黑暗，我们该等候神的时间和神的方法。受试炼，试炼是学习我们所需要的功课。 　　不成熟的拯救会阻挠神在我们身上的工作。我们应该把一切的难处交给神。只要有他的同在，就该甘心等在黑暗中。请记得在黑暗中与神同在，强如在光明中单独行走。——译自微小的声音 　　我们不该干预神的计划和旨意。什么时候我们摸一摸他的事情，我们立刻会弄坏他的工作。我们尽可以把钟拨到我们所要的时间，但是我们不能改变实在的时间；我们尽可以擘开玫瑰的花蕾，可是我们擘坏了那花。照样，我们尽可以自己谋算来躲避神所要我们经过的遭遇，但是于事无补。所以我们该将一切完全交给他。让我们住手罢。让我们对神说：“只要照你的旨意，不要照我的旨意。”——麦力德 山林里寒冷阴冥， 我想停步，神却要我前行， 我不明白为了什么原因。 忽在意欲停步的地方， 传出了岩石崩塌的巨声。 我要前进，神吩咐我停止， 我说：“遵照你的意旨”。 一大清晨有人发现， 在我要去的路上， 躺着斫死的毒蟒。 我或许不明究竟， 但我不再计问，什么缘故， 他指点我的路径，我就走去， 我虽无知，却有数， 总为我…选择全安道路。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5025.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
