{"id":15030,"no":73,"title":"March 14","content":"\"Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.\" (Exod. 20:21) \n \n God has still His hidden secrets, hidden from the wise and prudent. Do not fear them; be content to accept things that you cannot understand; wait patiently. Presently He will reveal to you the treasures of darkness, the riches of the glory of the mystery. Mystery is only the veil of God\u0027s face. \n \n Do not be afraid to enter the cloud that is settling down on your life. God is in it. The other side is radiant with His glory. \"Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you; but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ\u0027s sufferings.\" When you seem loneliest and most forsaken, God is nigh. He is in the dark cloud. Plunge into the blackness of its darkness without flinching; under the shrouding curtain of His pavilion you will find God awaiting you. --Selected. \n \n \"Hast thou a cloud? \n \n Something that is dark and full of dread; \n \n A messenger of tempest overhead? \n \n A something that is darkening the sky; \n \n A something growing darker bye and bye; \n \n A something that thou fear\u0027st will burst at last; \n \n A cloud that doth a deep, long shadow cast, \n \n God cometh in that cloud. \n \n Hast thou a cloud? \n \n It is Jehovah\u0027s triumph car: in this \n \n He rideth to thee, o\u0027er the wide abyss. \n \n It is the robe in which He wraps His form; \n \n For He doth gird Him with the flashing storm. \n \n It is the veil in which He hides the light \n \n Of His fair face, too dazzling for thy sight. \n \n God cometh in that cloud. \n \n Hast thou a cloud? \n \n A trial that is terrible to thee? \n \n A black temptation threatening to see? \n \n A loss of some dear one long thine own? \n \n A mist, a veiling, bringing the unknown? \n \n A mystery that unsubstantial seems: \n \n A cloud between thee and the sun\u0027s bright beams? \n \n God cometh in that cloud. \n \n Hast thou a cloud? \n \n A sickness--weak old age--distress and death? \n \n These clouds will scatter at thy last faint breath. \n \n Fear not the clouds that hover o\u0027er thy barque, \n \n Making the harbour\u0027s entrance dire and dark; \n \n The cloud of death, though misty, chill and cold, \n \n Will yet grow radiant with a fringe of gold. \n \n GOD cometh in that cloud.\" \n \n As Dr. C. stood on a high peak of the Rocky Mountains watching a storm raging below him, an eagle came up through the clouds, and soared away towards the sun and the water upon him glistened in the sunlight like diamonds. Had it not been for the storm he might have remained in the valley. The sorrows of life cause us to rise towards God. \n \n 　 三月十四日 \n \n “摩西就挨近神所在的幽暗之中”(出二十：21)。 \n \n 　　神今天仍有他隐藏的秘密，向聪明通达人藏起来。可是你不必怕它们；尽管在神面前接受你所不解的东西；忍耐等候。不久他要指示你黑暗中的宝贝，隐密中的荣耀。 \n \n 　　不要怕进前面的黑云。神在其中。“有火炼的试验临到你们，不要以为奇怪，(似乎是遭遇非常的事)倒要欢喜；因为你们是与基督一同受苦”(彼前四：12/13) 。当你感到孤单的时侯，须知神在咫尺。他在黑云中，等候你进去亲近他。——选 \n \n 黑云罩上了你的生命， \n \n 这种遭遇，可怕阴沉， \n \n 它预示风雨来临， \n \n 云渐渐迷漫开来， \n \n 一阵紧一阵，地暗天昏， \n \n 云中却隐藏着天上的神。 \n \n 黑云罩上了你的生命， \n \n 这是耶和华的凯旋车， \n \n 载着他前来给你温存， \n \n 云是他的面纱，他的衣襟。 \n \n 你受不住那样的光辉， \n \n 所以要遮掩他的圣容。 \n \n 黑云罩上了你的生命， \n \n 何等可怕的考验， \n \n 如失去了可爱的亲人， \n \n 又如威胁更如诱惑， \n \n 你将不知所措，心迷神昏， \n \n 但云中却隐藏着天上的神。 \n \n 黑云罩上了你的生命， \n \n 你是否遇上了衰老病痛和死亡的阴云？ \n \n 这些云将皆在你奄奄一息时来到， \n \n 正像驾舟归航，别怕港口黑暗； \n \n 死亡之云虽然寒冷阴沉， \n \n 终将镀上金边，逐渐光明， \n \n 神就在这云里来临。 \n \n 　　某医师一天站在一座高山顶上，观看山下的阵雨；他看见一头鹰冲出黑云，向上高飞，身上带着的水珠，在日光下闪烁，好似金钢钻一般美丽。如果山下没有阵雨，它必是仍在谷中。人生的苦难使我们向上近神。——选 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5009.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
