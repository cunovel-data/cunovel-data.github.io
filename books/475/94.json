{"id":15051,"no":94,"title":"April 4","content":"\"Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.\" (2 Kings 6:17)\n This is the prayer we need to pray for ourselves and for one another, \"Lord, open our eyes that we may see\"; for the world all around us, as well as around the prophet, is full of God\u0027s horses and chariots, waiting to carry us to places of glorious victory. And when our eyes are thus opened, we shall see in all events of life, whether great or small, whether joyful or sad, a \"chariot\" for our souls.\n Everything that comes to us becomes a chariot the moment we treat it as such; and, on the other hand, even the smallest trial may be a Juggernaut car to crush us into misery or despair if we consider it.\n It lies with each of us to choose which they shall be. It all depends, not upon what these events are, but upon how we take them. If we lie down under them, and let them roll over us and crush us, they become Juggernaut cars, but if we climb up into them, as into a car of victory, and make them carry us triumphantly onward and upward, they become the chariots of God. --Hannah Whitall Smith.\n The Lord cannot do much with a crushed soul, hence the adversary\u0027s attempt to push the Lord\u0027s people into despair and hopelessness over the condition of themselves, or of the church. It has often been said that a dispirited army goes forth to battle with the certainty of being beaten. We heard a missionary say recently that she had been invalided home purely because her spirit had fainted, with the consequence that her body sunk also. We need to understand more of these attacks of the enemy upon our spirits and how to resist them. If the enemy can dislodge us from our position, then he seeks to \"wear us out\" (Daniel 7:25) by a prolonged siege, so that at last we, out of sheer weakness, let go the cry of victory.\n 　 四月四日\n “以利沙祷告说，耶和华啊，求你开这少年人的眼目，使他能看见”（王下六：17）。\n 　　这一个祷告，也是我们需要为己为人求神的，“耶和华啊，开我们的眼目，使我们能看见；”因为在我们四围，和当日神人一样，都是火车火马，等待带领我们进入荣耀的胜利。当我们的眼目开启了以后，我们就能看见生活中所有的事情——无论大小，无论顺逆——都是我们进入胜利的“火车”。\n 　　山一般大的难处，也可以作我们的“火车”，只消我们看它是我们的“火车”；反而言之芥菜子那样的小事也可以作我们的“极轧闹车”。（印度教中费熙奴偶像所乘之车谓之“极轧闹车”。当车出行时，教徒躺身于地，任轮碾过伤命）。\n 　　这是我们各人自己定规的。这并不在事情的大小，乃在我们如何去看它。如果我们躺下来，任其碾过，顶小的难处也是我们的“极轧闹车”；如果我们爬上去，乘在上面，天大的难事也是神的“火车”，带领我们进入胜利的。——司密斯\n 　　神不能重用一个失望的人，因为仇敌的诡计就是尽力将神的子民推入绝望的境地去。常有人说：“垂头丧气的军队出去打仗，结果是稳败的”。这句话一点不错。今天我们需要知道仇敌怎样在我们的里面施行攻击，我们应当怎样去抵挡他。如果仇敌能把我们逐出阵地，他就能“折磨”（但七：25）我们叫我们全然失败，失去胜利的呼声。所以我们应当怎样小心站牢我们的阵地啊！——选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5030.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
