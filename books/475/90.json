{"id":15047,"no":90,"title":"March 31","content":"\"\u0027The wind was contrary.\" (Matt. 14:24) \n \n Rude and blustering the winds of March often are. Do they not typify the tempestuous seasons of my life? But, indeed, I ought to be glad that I make acquaintance with these seasons. Better it is that the rains descend and the floods come than that I should stay perpetually in the Lotus Land where it seems always afternoon, or in that deep meadowed Valley of Avilion where never wind blows loudly. Storms of temptation appear cruel, but do they not give intenser earnestness to prayer? Do they not compel me to seize the promises with a tighter hand grip? Do they not leave me with a character refined? \n \n Storms of bereavement are keen; but, then, they are one of the Father\u0027s ways of driving me to Himself, that in the secret of His presence His voice may speak to my heart, soft and low. There is a glory of the Master which can be seen only when the wind is contrary and the ship tossed with waves. \n \n \"Jesus Christ is no security against storms, but He is perfect security in storms. He has never promised you an easy passage, only a safe landing.\" \n \n Oh, set your sail to the heavenly gale, \n \n And then, no matter what winds prevail, \n \n No reef can wreck you, no calm delay; \n \n No mist shall hinder, no storm shall stay; \n \n Though far you wander and long you roam \n \n Through salt sea sprays and o\u0027er white sea foam, \n \n No wind that can blow but shall speed you Home. \n \n --Annie Johnson Flint.　 \n \n 　 三月三十一日 \n \n “那时船在水中，因风不顺，被浪摇撼”（太十四：24） \n \n 有的季节，往往刮着狂风。岂不象征着人生的坎坷？但能体验这种季节，我应该觉得欣幸。如果求远留在希腊神话中的百合花乡，那里的气候终年如一日，或永远留在绿草如茵的极乐岛，那里总是吹着和煦的轻风，与其如此，我宁愿有大雨的倾注，风潮的来临。试炼的风雨虽是狂暴，但我因此而有了更虔诚的祈祷，不仅使我把神的应许抓得更紧，而且使我的人格能提炼得更为纯洁。 \n \n 风雨的磨难是尖锐的，但这是神驱驰我们接近他的方法之一，在他冥冥存在之中，用轻柔低沉的声音，向我们说话，透入我们心之深处。主的荣耀，也只有在逆风及船舶为巨浪所抛掷的时候，才能显现。 \n \n 基督不能保证暴风雨之不来，但他能保证你在暴雨中的绝对安全。他没有应许你旅程的平静无事，他只应许你能安全到达目的地。 \n \n 趁着天赐的风，扬帆出航， \n \n 然后不管它的顺逆强弱， \n \n 只向前进，不怕任何阻挠， \n \n 没有暗礁或雾能使你遭殃。 \n \n 风雨不会如此永远猖狂， \n \n 也许要漂荡较长的时间， \n \n 绕道较远，终必送你回家， \n \n 结束碧白浪间的彷徨。 \n \n ——富林德 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5026.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
