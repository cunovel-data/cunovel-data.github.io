{"id":15048,"no":91,"title":"April 1","content":"\"Though he slay me, yet will I trust him.\" (Job 13:15) \n \"For I know whom I have believed.\" (2 Tim. 1:12)\n \"I will not doubt, though all my prayers return \n Unanswered from the still, white realm above;\n I will believe it is an all-wise love\n Which has refused these things for which I yearn;\n And though at times I cannot keep from grieving,\n Yet the pure ardor of my fixed believing\n Undimmed shall burn.\n \"I will not doubt, though all my ships at sea\n Come drifting home with broken masts and sails;\n I will believe the Hand which never fails,\n From seeming evil worketh good for me.\n And though I weep because those sails are tattered, \n Still will I cry, while my best hopes lie shattered:\n \u0027I trust in Thee.\u0027\n \"I will not doubt, though sorrows fall like rain,\n And troubles swarm like bees about a hive.\n I will believe the heights for which I strive\n Are only reached by anguish and by pain;\n And though I groan and writhe beneath my crosses.\n I yet shall see through my severest losses\n The greater gain.\n \"I will not doubt. Well anchored is this faith,\n Like some staunch ship, my soul braves every gale;\n So strong its courage that it will not quail\n To breast the mighty unknown sea of death.\n Oh, may I cry, though body parts with spirit,\n \u0027I do not doubt,\u0027 so listening worlds may hear it,\n With my last breath.\"\n \"In fierce storms,\" said an old seaman, \"we must do one thing; there is only one way: we must put the ship in a certain position and keep her there.\"\n This, Christian, is what you must do. Sometimes, like Paul, you can see neither sun nor stars, and no small tempest lies on you; and then you can do but one thing; there is only one way.\n Reason cannot help you; past experiences give you no light. Even prayer fetches no consolation. Only a single course is left. You must put your soul in one position and keep it there.\n You must stay upon the Lord; and come what may--winds, waves, cross-seas, thunder, lightning, frowning rocks, roaring breakers--no matter what, you must lash yourself to the helm, and hold fast your confidence in God\u0027s faithfulness, His covenant engagement, His everlasting love in Christ Jesus. --Richard Fuller. \n 四月一日\n “他虽杀我，然而我还要信靠他”（伯十三：15直译）。\n “因为我知道我所信的是谁”（提后一：12直译）。\n 我决不怀疑，虽然我的船队\n 在海上漂泊颠簸，帆樯破碎。\n 相信那从不失误的神之手，\n 将转灾祸为福祉充沛，\n 在失望中，我仍高呼信靠神，\n 纵然惋惜着船的破碎狼狈。\n 我决不怀疑，虽然祈求的一切\n 苍天还没有给我回音，\n 相信拒绝实现这些愿望，\n 乃是出于全智者的哀矜，\n 有时虽不禁愁闷，\n 丝毫未损我至诚不变的信心。\n 我决不怀疑，悲哀虽如雨降潮涨，\n 困难群集，像蜜蜂围聚蜂房。\n 相信要达成我争取的崇高目标，\n 唯有伤痛和苦难，才能担当，\n 虽在十字架下呻吟号呼，\n 将从惨痛失丧中获得更大报偿。\n 决不怀疑，我的信心碇泊稳妥，\n 如坚固巨艇，能受任何风浪，\n 绝不气馁，有的是毅力与勇敢，\n 足以面对那祸患莫测的海洋。\n 纵然牺牲尘世生命，只要一息尚存，\n “决不怀疑”，让这呼声播扬。\n 　　人生如渡洋海，不免遭遇风浪。一位老于航行者说道：“当浪高如山，风疾如火时，唯一的办法，就是将船停在一个地方，让它一直留在那里。”\n 　　在基督徒的生命中也是如此。有时，像保罗一样，“我们被风浪逼得甚急…太阳和星辰多日不愿露，又有狂风大浪催逼，我们得救的指望就都绝了”。（徒二十七：18/20）在这样的光景中，我们只能作一件事：将自己停在一个地方。\n 　　那时候，理由不能帮助我们；竭力挣扎，也不能产生效果；以往的经验，不能给我们亮光；甚至祷告，也得不着安慰。我们只有一个方法，就是安息我们自己在一个地方，一直留在那里。\n 　　我们只能安息在神的胸怀中；来的无论是狂风，暴雨，骇浪，怒涛，轰雷，闪电，浓雾，冰山…我们只要紧紧抓住舵柄——神的信实，誓约，和在基督耶稣里不止息的爱——好了。——付勒\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5027.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
