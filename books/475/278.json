{"id":15235,"no":278,"title":"October 5","content":"\"It came to pass . . . that the brook dried up\" (1 Kings 17:7)\n The education of our faith is incomplete if we have not learned that there is a providence of loss, a ministry of failing and of fading things, a gift of emptiness. The material insecurities of life make for its spiritual establishment. The dwindling stream by which Elijah sat and mused is a true picture of the life of each of us. \"It came to pass…that the brook dried up\"━that is the history of our yesterday, and a prophecy of our morrows. \n In some way or other we will have to learn the difference between trusting in the gift and trusting in the Giver. The gift may be good for a while, but the Giver is the Eternal Love. \n Cherith was a difficult problem to Elijah until he got to Zarephath, and then it was all as clear as daylight. God\u0027s hard words are never His last words. The woe and the waste and the tears of life belong to the interlude and not to the finale. \n Had Elijah been led straight to Zarephath he would have missed something that helped to make him a wiser prophet and a better man. He lived by faith at Cherith. And whensoever in your life and mine some spring of earthly and outward resource has dried up, it has been that we might learn that our hope and help are in God who made Heaven and earth. ━F. B. Meyer\n Perchance thou, too, \n hast camped by such sweet waters,\n And quenched with joy thy weary, \n parched soul’s thirst;\n To find, as time goes on,\n thy streamlet alters\n From, what it was at first.\n Hearts that have cheered, or soothed, or blest,\n or strengthened, Loves that have lavished so unstintedly; Joys, treasure joys ━ have passed,\n as time hath lengthened, Into obscurity.\n If thus, ah soul, the brook thy heart hath cherished,\n Doth fail thee now - no more thy thirst assuage,\n If its once glad refreshing streams have perished,\n Let HIM thy heart engage.\n He will not fail, nor mock, nor disappoint thee,\n His consolations change not with the years,\n With oil of joy He surely will anoint thee,\n And wipe away thy tears.\n ━J.Danson Smith \n 十月五日\n 「过了些日子，溪水就干了。」 （王上十七:7）\n 如果我们不知道损失是祝福，失败是成功，空虚是礼物的话，我们所受的信心教育还不完全。物质的缺乏常是灵力的建设。伊莱贾坐在基立溪旁注视那日渐干涸的溪水，正是我们生活的写眞。「过了些日子，溪水就干了。」━这是我们昨天的历史，明天的豫言。\n 有一天我们总会知道信靠恩赐和信靠赐恩者有甚么不同。恩赐也许有一时好用，可是赐恩者是永久的爱。\n 伊莱贾在未到撒勒法之前，基立对于他是一个难题。等他到了撒勒法之后，他就清楚明白了。神严厉的对付并不是最后的对付。生活中的灾祸、沙漠、眼泪，都是一些插入的音乐，并不是最后的精采。 \n 如果伊莱贾不经过基立，直接由基列往撒勒法去的话，他必定会失去许多帮助他的东西，因为他在基立过的是信心生活。在你我的生活中，甚么时候属地的泉源干了，属人的方法完了，我们就该知道我们的希望和帮助是在乎创造天地的神。━梅尔\n 你可能也曾露营歇息,\n 在这样美好的溪水之旁,\n 消除了你的疲倦,滋润了你的灵魂,\n 可是后来溪水枯干,不再有当日的风光。\n 安慰和福佑,曾经鼓舞你的心,\n 无穷的爱,无限的欢欣,\n 可是随着时光消逝,一切变了,\n 没有了温情,一片冷冷清清。\n 灵魂啊!假若曾使你欣喜的溪水干枯,\n 不能再给你解渴,你将如何?\n 祇要你投入神的怀抱,你无需烦恼。\n 祂不会使你失望,更不会对你讥笑,\n 祂的安慰不随时光流逝而改变,\n 擦去你的眼泪,把你的创伤医好。\n ━司密斯\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5513.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
