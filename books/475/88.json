{"id":15045,"no":88,"title":"March 29","content":"\"Consider the lilies, how they grow.\" (Matt. 6:28) \n \n I need oil,\" said an ancient monk; so he planted an olive sapling. \"Lord,\" he prayed, \"it needs rain that its tender roots may drink and swell. Send gentle showers.\" And the Lord sent gentle showers. \"Lord,\" prayed the monk, \"my tree needs sun. Send sun, I pray Thee.\" And the sun shone, gilding the dripping clouds. \"Now frost, my Lord, to brace its tissues,\" cried the monk. And behold, the little tree stood sparkling with frost, but at evening it died. \n \n Then the monk sought the cell of a brother monk, and told his strange experience. \"I, too, planted a little tree,\" he said, \"and see! it thrives well. But I entrust my tree to its God. He who made it knows better what it needs than a man like me. I laid no condition. I fixed not ways or means. \u0027Lord, send what it needs,\u0027 I prayed, \u0027storm or sunshine, wind, rain, or frost. Thou hast made it and Thou dost know.\u0027\" \n \n Yes, leave it with Him, \n \n The lilies all do, \n \n And they grow-- \n \n They grow in the rain, \n \n And they grow in the dew-- \n \n Yes, they grow: \n \n They grow in the darkness, all hid in the night-- \n \n They grow in the sunshine, revealed by the light-- \n \n Still they grow. \n \n Yes, leave it with Him \n \n \u0027Tis more dear to His heart, \n \n You will know, \n \n Than the lilies that bloom, \n \n Or the flowers that start \n \n \u0027Neath the snow: \n \n Whatever you need, if you seek it in prayer, \n \n You can leave it with Him--for you are His care. \n \n You, you know. \n \n --Selected. \n \n 　 三月二十九日 \n \n 　　“你想野地里的百合花，怎么长起来” (太六：28)。 \n \n 　　古时有一个修道士，种了一棵橄榄树。他祷告说：“神啊，它需要水分，好叫它柔嫩的根得吸收而长发。求你降下滋润的甘霖来。”神就降雨下来。他又祷告说： “神啊，我的树需要日光，我求你给它日光”。于是云散雨止，神就给它日光。他再祷告说：“神啊，现在它需要霜来坚固它的组织。”看哪，那株幼小的植物上果然罩上了一层薄霜。但是到了傍晚，树却死了。 \n \n 　　于是他就去见另一个修道士，告诉他自己奇异的经历。那修道士回答说：“我也种了一棵小树。看哪！现在长得多么茂盛。我没有为我的树操一点心，只把它交给它的神。造它的神知道它的需要，远胜过像我这样无知的人。所以我并不向神提出条件，建议，方法。我祷告说：‘神啊，你把它所需要的给它，无论是风，是雨，是霜，是雪，是日光，是什么…你既造它，你一定知道它，也一定会供给它。’”——选 \n \n 是的，像百合花那样， \n \n 一切让神去安排， \n \n 它们自然生长成材， \n \n 在雨露阴晴之中， \n \n 照常发育，叶茂花盛， \n \n 无庸你顾虑喋喋。 \n \n 是的，一切让神去安排， \n \n 他爱你，为你的设想周全， \n \n 更甚于百合花落花开； \n \n 在祷告中表示了愿望， \n \n 一切让神去安排， \n \n 靠他为你栽培。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5024.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
