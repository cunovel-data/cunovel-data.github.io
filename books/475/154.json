{"id":15111,"no":154,"title":"June 3","content":"\"Let us pass over unto the other side.\" (Mark 4:35)\\n\\n Even when we go forth at Christ\u0027s command, we need not expect to escape storms; for these disciples were going forth at Christ\u0027s command, yet they encountered the fiercest storm and were in great danger of being overwhelmed, so that they cried out in their distress for Christ\u0027s assistance.\\n\\n Though Christ may delay His coming in our time of distress, it is only that our faith may be tried and strengthened, and that our prayers may be more intense, and that our desires for deliverance may be increased, so that when the deliverance does come we will appreciate it more fully.\\n\\n Christ gave them a gentle rebuke, saying, \"Where is your faith?\" Why did you not shout victory in the very face of the storm, and say to the raging winds and rolling waves, \"You can do no harm, for Christ, the mighty Savior is on board\"?\\n\\n It is much easier to trust when the sun is shining than when the storm is raging.\\n\\n We never know how much real faith we have until it is put to the test in some fierce storm; and that is the reason why the Savior is on board.\\n\\n If you are ever to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might, your strength will be born in some storm. --Selected.\\n\\n \"With Christ in the vessel,\\n\\n I smile at the storm.\"\\n\\n Christ said, \"Let us go to the other side\"--not to the middle of the lake to be drowned. --Dan Crawford.\\n\\n 　 　 六月三日\\n\\n “我们渡到那边去罢”（可四：35）。\\n\\n 　　我们就是遵着神的命令出去，我们还是不能盼望不遇见患难的；这些门徒听从主的命令出去，他们还是遭遇了顶危险的暴雨，甚至他们大声急呼主的拯救。\\n\\n 　　虽然在我们顶紧急的时候，主还耽延他的拯救，但是他的目的乃是要使我们的信心经过试炼，而更增强；使我们的祷告更加虔诚；使我们得拯救的渴望更加迫切；使我们从此更重视主的拯救。\\n\\n 　　主给他们一个温柔的责备，说：“你们的信心何在”？意思就是说：你们为什么不向狂风怒涛夸胜说：“你们不能伤害我们，因为主在船上呢”！\\n\\n 　　在日光中信靠，比在风波中信靠，容易得多。\\n\\n 　　若不放我们在试炼中，我们决不会知道我们自己有多少信心。所以救主要一同与我们坐船。倘若你经常因主而坚强起来，你的力量将在暴风雨中诞生。\\n\\n “与主同舟，我复何忧！\\n\\n 笑彼风浪，岂能为仇”？\\n\\n 　　基督耶稣说：“我们渡到那边去吧“。他不是说任凭我们沉在水里。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5157.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
