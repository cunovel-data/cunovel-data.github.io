{"id":15291,"no":334,"title":"November 30","content":"\"And seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest\" (Jer. 45:5) A promise given for hard places, and a promise of safety and life in the midst of tremendous pressure, a life \"for a prey.\" It may well adjust itself to our own times, which are growing harder as we near the end of the age, and the Tribulation times. What is the meaning of \"a life for a prey\"? It means a life snatched out of the jaws of the destroyer, as David snatched the lamb from the lion. It means not removal from the noise of the battle and the presence of our foes; but it means a table in the midst of our enemies, a shelter from the storm, a fortress amid the foe, a life preserved in the face of continual pressure: Paul\u0027s healing when pressed out of measure so that he despaired of life; Paul\u0027s Divine help when the thorn remained, but the power of Christ rested upon him and the grace of Christ was sufficient. Lord, give me my life for a prey, and in the hardest places help me today to be victorious. ━Days of Heaven upon Earth We often pray to be delivered from calamities; we even trust that we shall be; but we do not pray to be made what we should be, in the very presence of the calamities; to live amid them, as long as they last, in the consciousness that we are, held and sheltered by the Lord, and can therefore remain in the midst of them, so long as they continue, without any hurt. For forty days and nights, the Saviour was kept in the presence of Satan in the wilderness, and that, under circumstances of special trial, His human nature being weakened by want of food and rest. The furnace was heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated, but the three Hebrew children were kept a season amid its flames as calm and composed in the presence of the tyrant\u0027s last appliances of torture, as they were in the presence of himself before their time of deliverance came. And the livelong night did Daniel sit among the lions, and when he was taken up out of the den, \"no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.\"(Dan.6:23) They dwelt in the presence of the enemy, because they dwelt in the presence of God. ━Selected 十一月三十日 「你为自己图谋大事么？不要图谋。我必使灾祸临到凡有血气的。但你无论往那里去，我必使你以自己的命为掠物。这是耶和华说的。」 （耶四十五:5） 在极大的灾祸中，耶和华给杰里迈亚一个安全的应许，就是「以自己的命为掠物」。在这末世时代，这应许在我们身上，也是非常适用的。 「以自己的命为掠物」到底是甚么意思呢？意思说：我们能从毁灭者的爪牙中间抢出我们自己的命来，好像戴维从狮子口中抢出羊羔来一般。这并不是挪去战争、挪去仇敌；这乃是在敌人面前摆设筵席，在风雨中间建立避难所，在灾祸中间存留性命。保罗的刺虽然没有离开他，但是基督的恩典够他用的，基督的能力覆庇了他。主阿，求祢使我以自己的命为掠物，在最危险难的环境中获得胜利！━译自地上的属天生活 我们常求脱离灾祸，却不求在灾祸中间得胜；我们应当活在灾祸中间，深信我们被保守在神的庇护之下，绝不能受到丝毫伤损。我们的主在旷野，受魔鬼的试探四十昼夜，虽然又饿又倦，魔鬼并不能伤害祂。火窑虽然比寻长烧热七倍，三个希伯来人却在火中游行。但以理虽然被扔在狮子坑中，当他从坑里被系上来的时候，「身上毫无伤损，因为信靠他的神。」（但六:23）━选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5569.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
