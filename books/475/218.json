{"id":15175,"no":218,"title":"August 6","content":"\"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south, blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out!\" (Song of Solomon 4:16)\\n\\n Look at the meaning of this prayer a moment. Its root is found in the fact that, as delicious odors may lie latent in a spice tree, so graces may lie unexercised and undeveloped in a Christian\u0027s heart. There is many a plant of profession; but from the ground there breathes forth no fragrance of holy affections or of godly deeds. The same winds blow on the thistle bush and on the spice tree, but it is only one of them which gives out rich odors. \\n\\n Sometimes God sends severe blasts of trial upon His children to develop their graces. Just as torches burn most brightly when swung to and fro; just as the juniper plant smells sweetest when flung into the flames; so the richest qualities of a Christian often come out under the north wind of suffering and adversity. Bruised hearts often emit the fragrance that God loveth to smell. --Selected. \\n\\n “I had a tiny box, a precious box\\n\\n Of human love-my spikenard of great price;\\n\\n I kept it close within my heart of hearts,\\n\\n And scarce would lift the lid lest it should waste\\n\\n Its perfume on the air. One day a strange\\n\\n Deep sorrow carne with crushing weight, and fell\\n\\n Upon my costly treasure, sweet and rare,\\n\\n And broke the box to atoms. All my heart\\n\\n Rose in dismay and sorrow at this waste,\\n\\n But as I mourned, behold ca miracle\\n\\n Of grace Divine. My human love was changed\\n\\n To Heaven\u0027s own, and poured in healing streams\\n\\n On other broken hearts, while soft and clear\\n\\n A voice above me whispered, \"Child of Mine,\\n\\n With comfort wherewith thou art comforted,\\n\\n From this time forth, go comfort others,\\n\\n And thou shalt know blest fellowship with Me,\\n\\n Whose broken heart of love hath healed the world.”\\n\\n 八月六日\\n\\n 「北风阿，兴起。南风阿，吹来。吹在我的围内，使其中的香气发出来。」（歌四16）\\n\\n 我们先把这节圣经的意义看一看。事实告诉我们芬芳的香气是潜伏在香料里面的；照样，没有运用没有开发的恩典，也是隐伏在基督人的心内的。 \\n\\n 有时候，神用猛烈的狂风来试炼祂的孩子们，为的是要开发隐伏的恩典。火把着得最旺的时候，是将它拿着晃动的时候；桧木的气味最香的时候，是将它投在火中焚烧的时候。照样，一个基督人最丰富的灵命，也是各种苦难和试炼下挣扎出来的。一个压伤的心，纔会发出神所爱的芬芳来。──选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5302.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
