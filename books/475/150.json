No art can teach them; no rules of voice can make them perfectly sung. Their music is in the heart. They are songs of memory, of personal experience. They bring out their burden from the shadow of the past; they mount on the wings of yesterday.\n St. John says that even in Heaven there will be a song that can only be fully sung by the sons of earth--the strain of redemption. Doubtless it is a song of triumph, a hymn of victory to the Christ who made us free. But the sense of triumph must come from the memory of the chain.\n No angel, no archangel can sing it so sweetly as I can. To sing it as I sing it, they must pass through my exile, and this they cannot do. None can learn it but the children of the Cross.\n And so, my soul, thou art receiving a music lesson from thy Father. Thou art being educated for the choir invisible. There are parts of the symphony that none can take but thee.\n There are chords too minor for the angels. There may be heights in the symphony which are beyond the scale--heights which angels alone can reach; but there are depths which belong to thee, and can only be touched by thee.\n Thy Father is training thee for the part the angels cannot sing; and the school is sorrow. I have heard many say that He sends sorrow to prove thee; nay, He sends sorrow to educate thee, to train thee for the choir invisible.\n In the night He is preparing thy song. In the valley He is tuning thy voice. In the cloud He is deepening thy chords. In the rain He is sweetening thy melody. In the cold He is moulding thy expression. In the transition from hope to fear He is perfecting thy lights.\n Despise not thy school of sorrow, O my soul; it will give thee a unique part in the universal song. --George Matheson.\n \"Is the midnight closing round you?\n Are the shadows dark and long?\n Ask Him to come close beside you,\n And He\u0027ll give you a new, sweet song.\n He\u0027ll give it and sing it with you;\n And when weakness lets it down,\n He\u0027ll take up the broken cadence,\n And blend it with His own.\n \"And many a rapturous minstrel\n Among those sons of light,\n Will say of His sweetest music\n \u0027I learned it in the night.\u0027\n And many a rolling anthem,\n That fills the Father\u0027s home,\n Sobbed out its first rehearsal,\n In the shade of a darkened room.\"\n 　 五月三十日\n “除了从地上买来的那十四万四千人以外，没有人能学这歌”（启十四：3）。\n 　　有一种歌，既非艺术所能教，也非乐理所能编，只有在患难中能学会的。这种歌它发自内心，是一种记忆与亲身经历的歌声，从过去的苦难中宣泄出来，而以昨天的体验，构成了今天的赞美。圣约翰说，即使在天上，也只有一首世人唱得完美的歌曲——救赎之颂。无疑地这是胜利之歌。但胜利意义之产生，必须来自锁链的回忆。\n 　　没有一个天使能唱得象我们这么好听。他们要唱，他们就必须走我们所走的道路，经历我们所经历的经历。没有一人能学会，除了十架之子。\n 　　所以，我的己哪，你现在正在从父学习音乐功课。他训练你，要使你有资格加入天上的大歌咏团。有一部分声音，没有别人能担任，连天使和天使长也不能。只有你一人能担任的。天使虽能唱高音，但是这幽而且沉的低音，只有你一人能唱。\n 　　你的父在训练你担任那天使所不能担任的一部分；训练你的学校就是苦难。很多人说，神给你苦难，为了要证验你，但有一个更确当的说法，就是神给你的苦难，为了要教育你，训练你能参加天上的歌咏团。\n 　　在黑云中他试你的声音。在忧伤中他教你唱歌的表情。在患难中他练你的气。在试炼中他教你发音的准确。\n 　　不要轻看这神的音乐院；许多人虽然羡慕，可是还不能被选呢！——马得胜\n 黑夜已包围上来了吗？\n 带着它深长的阴沉；\n 此时，求他到你身旁，\n 他会教你一首新的咏吟。\n 他要陪同你歌唱，\n 如果你气衰而歌声不高扬，\n 他会补缀零落的音韵，\n 用他的歌声来调节均匀。\n 许多逍遥的吟游诗人，\n 沐浴着属天的圣恩，\n 见证他们学到了最美的韵音，\n 是在万籁俱寂的夜深。\n 许多上达宝座的赞颂，\n 音律抑扬生动，\n 都是在幽暗的内室，\n 发出初次的吟诵。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5139.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
