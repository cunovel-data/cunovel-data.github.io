The stones from the wall said, \"We come from the mountains far away, from the sides of the craggy hills. Fire and water have worked on us for ages, but made us only crags. Human hands have made us into a dwelling where the children of your immortal race are born, and suffer, and rejoice, and find rest and shelter, and learn the lessons set them by our Maker and yours. But we have passed through much to fit us for this. Gunpowder has rent our very heart; pickaxes have cleaved and broken us, it seemed to us often with out design or meaning, as we lay misshapen stones in the quarry; but gradually we were cut into blocks, and some of us were chiseled with finer instruments to a sharper edge. But we are complete now, and are in our places, and are of service. You are in the quarry still, and not complete, and therefore to you, as once to us, much is inexplicable. But you are destined for a higher building, and one day you will be placed in it by hands not human, a living stone in a heavenly temple. --Selected. “In the still air the music lies unheard; In the rough marble beauty hides unseen; To make the music and the beauty needs The master\u0027s touch, the sculptor\u0027s chisel keen.” “Great Master, touch us with Thy skillful hands; Let not the music that 1\u0027s in us die!. Great Sculptor, hew and polish us; nor let, Hidden and lost, thy form within us lie!” 九月一日 「我必以彩色安置你的石头。」（赛五十四11） 墙上的石头说：「我们是从遥远的高山那边来的。火和水造作了我们好久，不过将我们造成了峭壁。人手将我们造成了一所住宅━你们的子孙在里面生长、受苦、享乐，得到休息和庇护，学习造我们的主━也是造你们的主━所给他们的功课。但是我们得到今天的地步，是曾经经历了许多苦难的，火药曾炸裂了我们的心；利斧曾劈开了我们的肺；我们常常觉得这样摧残我们，是毫无理由的，因为我们仍在石坑里丑陋地横着，毫无用处。后来我们逐渐被截成了整齐的石块。到了现在，我们已经完备了，已经在这里尽职了。 你们却还在石坑里，还没有完备，所以你们，正像我们从前一样，还有许多事情解释不通。但是有一件事，是我所知道的：有一天，你们将要被神手（非人手）安置在天殿里做活石。」－－选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5392.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
