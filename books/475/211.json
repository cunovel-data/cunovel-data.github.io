Any good work, therefore, any kindness, or any service I can render to any soul of man or animal, let me do it now. Let me not neglect or defer it, for I shall not pass this way again. --- An Old Quaker Saying. Give what you have; to someone it may be better than you dare to think.--- Longfellow. It isn\u0027t the thing you do, dear, It\u0027s the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun; The tender word unspoken, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts at night. The stone you might have lifted Out of your brother\u0027s way, The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say; The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That you had no time or thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels, Which even mortals find- They come in night and silence, Each chill reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear. And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it\u0027s not the thing you do, dear, It\u0027s the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache, At the setting of the sun. ─Adelaide Proctor. 七月三十日 「只……一杯凉水。」（太十:42） 　　我应当怎样作呢？我在这世界的日子非常短少，所以有什么工作、恩惠、服役，我能给人的，让我现在就给吧。让我不再忽视，不再迁延吧； 因为以后我没有机会再经过这条路了。── 贵格会格言 　　把你所有的给人；你所给的，对他也许有出你意外的帮助。── 郎弗罗","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5281.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
