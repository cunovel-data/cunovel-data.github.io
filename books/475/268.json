Canst thou find any reason why thou art so often mourning instead of rejoicing? Why yield to gloomy anticipations? Who told thee that the night would never end in day? Who told thee that the winter of thy discontent would proceed from frost to frost, from snow and ice, and hail, to deeper snow, and yet more heavy tempest of despair? Knowest thou not that day follows night, that flood comes after ebb, that spring and summer succeed winter? Hope thou then! Hope thou ever! for God fails thee not. --C. H. Spurgeon “ He was better to me than all my hopes; He was better than all my fears; He made a bridge of my broken works, And a rainbow of my tears. The billows that guarded rny sea-girt path, But carried my Lord on their crest; When I dwell on the days of my wilderness march I can lean on His love for the rest. ” “ He emptied my hands of my treasured store, And His covenant love revealed, There zoos not at wound in my aching heart, But the balm of His breath hath healed. Oh, tender and true was the chastening sore, In wisdom, that taught and tried, Till the soul that He sought was trusting in Him, And nothing on earth beside. ” “ He guided by paths that I could not see, By ways that I have not known; The crooked was straight, and the rough was plain, As I followed the Lord alone. I praise Him still for the pleasant palms, And the water-springs by the way, For the glowing pillar of flame by night, And the sheltering cloud by day. ” “ Never a watch on the dreariest halt, But some promise of love endears; I read from the past, that my future shall be, Far better than all my fears. Like the golden pot, of the wilderness bread, Laid up with the blossoming rod, All safe in the ark, with the law of the Lord, Is the covenant care of my God. ” 九月二十五日 「我为何……时常哀痛？」（诗四十二9） 信徒阿，你能不能回答这个问句呢？你有没有甚么理由叫你时常哀痛毫无喜乐呢？你为甚么容让未来的忧郁这样摧残你呢？谁告诉你黑夜永不会变白昼呢？谁告诉你冬日的霜雪冰雹永不会融解呢？谁告诉你今日的风雨会越下越大呢？谁告诉你你的失望会变成绝望呢？岂不知严冬一过就是春夏么？所以你当仰望神！－－司布眞","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5416.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
