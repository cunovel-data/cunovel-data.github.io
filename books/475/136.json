{"id":15093,"no":136,"title":"May 16","content":"\"Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.\" (Dan. 10:12, 13)\\n\\n We have wonderful teaching here on prayer, and we are shown the direct hindrance from Satan.\\n\\n Daniel had fasted and prayed twenty-one days, and had a very hard time in prayer. As far as we read the narrative, it was not because Daniel was not a good man, nor because his prayer was not right; but it was because of a special attack of Satan.\\n\\n The Lord started a messenger to tell Daniel that his prayer was answered the moment Daniel began to pray; but an evil angel met the good angel and wrestled with him, hindering him. There was a conflict in the heavens; and Daniel seemed to go through an agony on earth the same as that which was going on in the heavens.\\n\\n \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers…against wicked spirits in high places\" (Eph. 6:12, margin).\\n\\n Satan delayed the answer three full weeks. Daniel nearly succumbed, and Satan would have been glad to kill him; but God will not suffer anything to come above that we \"are able to bear.\"\\n\\n Many a Christian\u0027s prayer is hindered by Satan; but you need not fear when your prayers and faith pile up; for after a while they will be like a flood, and will not only sweep the answer through, but will also bring some new accompanying blessing. --Sermon.\\n\\n Hell does its worst with the saints. The rarest souls have been tested with high pressures and temperatures, but Heaven will not desert them. --W. L. Watkinson.\\n\\n 　 五月十六日\\n\\n “但以理啊，不要惧怕，因为从你第一日专心求明白将来的事，又在你神面前刻苦己心，你的言语已蒙应允，我是因你的言语而来。但波斯国的魔君，拦阻我二十一日”（但十：12/13）。\\n\\n 　　这几节圣经给我们看见祷告方面一件非常的事情，就是撒但直接的拦阻。\\n\\n 　　但以理禁食祷告了二十一天在祷告上花了极大的苦工；可是没有得到答应。从历史上我们看见这并非是因为但以理有罪的阻隔，也并非是因为他的祷告不正当；乃是因为撒但特别的攻击。\\n\\n 　　神的使者告诉但以理：当但以理一起始祷告，神就差遣使者去答应他；但是波斯国的魔君中途拦阻神的使者，和他摔跤。以至但以理在地上受苦。\\n\\n 　　“我们并不是与属血气的摔跤，乃是与那些执政的，掌权的…天空属灵气的恶魔摔跤”（弗六：12）。\\n\\n 　　撒但延迟了神的答应有三星期之久。但以理差不多要悲伤死了（但十：2），撒但的目的原想使他悲伤至死的；但是神不让他的儿女背负过于他们所能背负的轭。\\n\\n 　　许多基督徒的祷告都同样被撒但拦阻；但是你用不着怕你的祷告和信心会堆积得太多；因为不久它们要像洪水一般骤然冲来，不但带着答应，也带着新的祝福。\\n\\n 　　最属灵的信徒，常会受到最厉害的试探。但是神必不遗弃他们。——华金生\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5125.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
