{"id":15071,"no":114,"title":"April 24","content":"\"Faith is...the evidence of things not seen.\" (Heb. 11:1)\n True faith drops its letter in the post office box, and lets it go. Distrust holds on to a corner of it, and wonders that the answer never comes. I have some letters in my desk that have been written for weeks, but there was some slight uncertainty about the address or the contents, so they are yet unmailed. They have not done either me or anybody else any good yet. They will never accomplish anything until I let them go out of my hands and trust them to the postman and the mail.\n This the way with true faith. It hands its case over to God, and then He works. That is a fine verse in the Thirty-seventh Psalm: \"Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him, and He worketh.\" But He never worketh till we commit. Faith is a receiving or still better, a taking of God\u0027s proffered gifts. We may believe, and come, and commit, and rest; but we will not fully realize all our blessing until we begin to receive and come into the attitude of abiding and taking. --Days of Heaven upon Earth.\n Dr. Payson, when a young man, wrote as follows, to an aged mother, burdened with intense anxiety on account of the condition of her son: \"You give yourself too much trouble about him. After you have prayed for him, as you have done, and committed him to God, should you not cease to feel anxious respecting him? The command, \u0027Be careful for nothing,\u0027 is unlimited; and so is the expression, \u0027Casting all your care on him.\u0027 If we cast our burdens upon another, can they continue to press upon us? If we bring them away with us from the Throne of Grace, it is evident we do not leave them there. With respect to myself, I have made this one test of my prayers: if after committing anything to God, I can, like Hannah, come away and have my mind no more sad, my heart no more pained or anxious, I look upon it as one proof that I have prayed in faith; but, if I bring away my burden, I conclude that faith was not in exercise.\"\n 　 四月二十四日\n “信……是未见之事的确据”（来十一：1）。\n 　　真信心把信件投在邮箱里以后就让它去了。不信把信件放在邮箱口，执住一角，不肯脱手同时又诧异回信还没有来。在我的书桌里有好几封写就了好久的信，到今天还没有发出去，因为我不确知地址有否错误。它们对于我和我的亲友还没有发生什么关系。它们也永远不会发生什么，除非我把它们投在邮箱里，完全信托邮局。\n 　　真信心就是这样。它把事情交给神以后就让它去了。神就成全。诗篇三十七篇五节说得顶好：“当将你的事交托耶和华，并倚靠他，他就必成全”。但是我们不交托，神就不成全。信就是接受，或更准确一点，领取，神所预备的礼物。让我们前来相信，交托，接受，在我们以顺从的态度，开始接受之前，我们是不会完全认识我们所得的祝福。——地上的天上生活\n 　　贝逊博士在他年轻的时候，遇到一位老妇人。她焦心忧虑她的儿子。贝逊写信给这位老妇人说：“你过于为你的儿子担心了。你已经为他祈祷，把他交付给神，还不应当安心吗”？神命令我们不要为任何事情担心，这是没有限度的，所谓把一切忧虑卸给神，用意即在于此。如果我们已把肩上的重负交给了别人，我们岂非完全轻松了吗？如果再从神那里取了回来，显然就没有交给神。在我自己，常常把下面这个原则来测验我的祷告；倘使把任何事情交给了神，我就可以轻松地离开，心中再无半点悲哀，苦痛或焦虑，这可以证明我们的祈祷是出于信心；如果再把负担放在自己的肩头，就证明我们的信心不够，没有发生作用。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5050.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
