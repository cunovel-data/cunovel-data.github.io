{"id":15195,"no":238,"title":"August 26","content":"\"It is not in me\" (Job 28:14).\n I remember a summer in which I said, \"It is the ocean I need,\" and I went to the ocean; but it seemed to say, \"It is not in me!\" The ocean did not do for me what I thought it would. Then I said, \"The mountains will rest me,\" and I went to the mountains, and when I awoke in the morning there stood the grand mountain that I had wanted so much to see; but it said, \"It is not in me!\" It did not satisfy. Ah! I needed the ocean of His love, and the high mountains of His truth within. It was wisdom that the \"depths\" said they did not contain, and that could not be compared with jewels or gold or precious stones. Christ is wisdom and our deepest need. Our restlessness within can only be met by the revelation of His eternal friendship and love for us.--Margaret Bottome\n “My heart is there!\n Where, on eternal hills, my loved one dwells.\n Among the lilies and asphodels;\n Clad in the brightness of the Great White Throne,\n Glad in the smile of Him who sits thereon,\n The glory gilding all His wealth of hair.\n And making His immortal face more fair—\n THERE IS MY TREASURE and my heart is there.”\n “My heart is there!\n With Him who made all earthly life so sweet,\n So fit to live, and yet to die so meet;\n So mild, so grand, so gentle and so brave,\n So ready to forgive , so strong to save.\n His fair, pure Spirit makes the Heavens more fair,\n And thither rises all my longing prayer—\n THERE IS MY TREASURE and my heart is there.”\n -Favorite poem of the late- Chas.E.Cowman\n You cannot detain the eagle in the forest. You may gather around him a chorus of the choicest birds; you may give him a perch on the goodliest pine; you may charge winged messengers to bring him choicest dainties; but he will spurn them all. Spreading his lofty wings, and with his eye on the Alpine cliff, he will soar away to his own ancestral halls amid the munition of rocks and the wild music of tempest and waterfall.\n The soul of man, in its eagle soarings, will rest with nothing short of the Rock of Ages. Its ancestral halls are the halls of Heaven. Its munitions of rocks are the attributes of God. The sweep of its majestic flight is Eternity! “Lord, THOU hast been our dwelling place in all generations.”(Ps.90:1)--Macduff.\n “My Home is God Himself ”; Christ brought me there.\n I laid me down within His mighty arms;\n He took me up, and safe from all alarms\n He bore me \"where no foot but His hath trod,”\n Within the holiest at Home with God,\n And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there.\n 0 Holy Place! O Home divinely fair!\n And we, God\u0027s little ones, abiding there.\n \"My Home is God Himself\"; it was not so.!\n A long, long road I traveled night and day,\n And sought to find within myself some way,\n Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;\n Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,\n And then I found Christ was the only way,\n That I must come to Him and in Him stay,\n And God had told me so.\n And now \"My Home is God \", and sheltered there,\n God meets the trails of my earthly life,\n God compasses me round from storm and strife,\n God takes the burden of my daily care.\n O Wondrous Place ! O Home divinely fair!\n And I, God\u0027s little one, safe hidden there.\n Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me,\n So make me dead to everything but Thee;\n That as I rest within my Home most fair,\n My soul may evermore and only see,\n My God in everything and everywhere;\n My Home is God.\n -Author Unknown\n 八月二十六日\n 「深渊说，不在我内。」（伯廿八14）\n 我记得有一年夏天，我说：「我所需要的是海洋。」我就到海洋的地方去，但是海洋说：「不在我内！」海洋并不照我所要的给我成就。于是我说：「高山一定会使我得到安息。」我就到有高山的地方去，我清晨醒来，前面立着我所渴望的巍然的高山，但是高山说：「不在我内！」高山又不能使我满足。哦！我所需要的究竟是甚么呢？我所需要的乃是神的眞理山。深渊说，智慧不在它里面；是的，智慧本不像珍珠、黄金和宝石那样多。惟有基督是智慧，是我们最大的需要。我们的烦恼，只有基督的友谊和爱情能安慰我们。－－濮登\n 你没有法子将一只老鹰扣留在森林里。你就是替牠聚集了一群最美丽的小鸟在牠四围歌唱，你就是给牠在最大的松树上安放一根栖木，你就是差遣有翼的使者带最美味的珍馐给牠，都不能动牠的心。伸展着高耸的翅膀，眼望着高临的绝壁，牠喜欢飞往牠自己的老家━盘石、风雨、瀑布中━去安息的。\n 人类的心，也像老应一般。如果没有永久的盘石，就永远得不到安息。我们的老家乃是天家。「主阿，祢世世代代作我们的居所。」（诗九十1）－－马克特夫\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5322.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
