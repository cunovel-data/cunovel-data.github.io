{"id":15285,"no":328,"title":"November 24","content":"“Be still, and know that I am God” (Ps. 46:10)\n Is there any note of music in all the chorus as mighty as the emphatic pause? Is there any word in all the Psalter more eloquent than that one word, Selah (Pause)? Is there anything more thrilling and awful than the hush that comes before the bursting of the tempest and the strange quiet that seems to fall upon all nature before some preternatural phenomenon or convulsion? Is there anything that can touch our hearts as the power of stillness? \n There is for the heart that will cease from itself, “the peace of God that passeth all understanding,”(Phil.4:6)a “quietness and confidence”(Is.30:15) which is the source of all strength, a sweet peace “which nothing can offend,” a deep rest which the world can neither give nor take away. There is in the deepest center of the soul a chamber of peace where God dwells, and where, if we will only enter in and hush every other sound, we can hear His still, small voice. \n There is in the swiftest wheel that revolves upon its axis a place in the very center, where there is no movement at all; and so in the busiest life there may be a place where we dwell alone with God, in eternal stillness, There is only one way to know God. “Be still, and know.”“God is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him.”(Hag.2:20) ━Selected \n “All-loving Father, sometimes we have walked under starless skies that dripped darkness like drenching rain. We despaired of starshine or moonlight or sunrise. The sullen blackness gloomed above us as if it would last forever. And out of the dark there spoke no soothing voice to mend our broken hearts. We would gladly have welcomed some wild thunder peal to break the torturing stillness of that over-brooding night.”\n “But Thy winsome whisper of eternal love spoke more sweetly to our bruised and bleeding souls than any winds that breathe across Aeolian harps. It was Thy \u0027still small voice\u0027 that spoke to us. We were listening and we heard. We looked and saw Thy face radiant with the light of love. And when we heard Thy voice and saw Thy face, new life came back to us as life comes back to withered blooms that drink the summer rain.” ━Selected \n 十一月二十四日 \n 「你们要安静，要知道我是神。」 （诗四十六:10/直译）\n 音乐谱中能不能漏去休止符呢？诗篇中能不能漏去「细拉」呢？如果不能的话，人生也不能漏去安静。世上没有一件东西能像「安静」那样摸着我们的心。 \n 只有在安静的时候，我们纔能得到「神所赐出人意外的平安」（腓四:7）；纔能得到「平静安稳」（赛卅:15）━得力的来源；纔能得到世界所不能给与，不能夺去的安息；纔能听见神微小的声音。\n 在轴上旋转得最快的车轮，它的中心有一个地方，是一无动静的；照样，在我们最忙碌的生活，我们的灵里仍能顶安静地与神单独亲近的。「耶和华在祂的圣殿中。全地的人，都当在他面前肃敬静默。」（哈二:20）━选\n 慈爱的父阿，有时我们在无星之夜行走，四围全是黑暗；前面既没有星光，又没有月光。惨淡的黑暗似乎永远不会退去了。\n 在这样的沉寂中，祢柔和的微声安慰了我们流血的心。我们听见了祢微小的声音，看见了祢焕发的慈容，我们的生命就新鲜得如同枯萎的花儿饮了雨露一般。━选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5563.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
