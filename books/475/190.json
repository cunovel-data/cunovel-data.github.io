Yes, is it not an asbestos armor, against which the heat has no power? Let the affliction come━God has chosen me. Poverty, thou mayest stride in at my door; but God is in the house already, and He has chosen me. Sickness, thou mayest intrude; but I have a balsam ready━God has chosen me. Whatever befall me in this vale of tears, I know that He has chosen me.\n Fear not, Christian; Jesus is with thee. In all thy fiery trials, His presence is both thy comfort and safety. He will never leave one whom He has chosen for His own. \"Fear not, for I am with thee,\" is His sure word of promise to His chosen ones in \"the furnace of affliction.\"(Gen.26:24) ━C. H. Spurgeon\n Pain\u0027s furnace heat within me quivers,\n God\u0027s breath upon the flame doth blow;\n And all my heart in anguish shivers\n And trembles at the fiery glow;\n And yet I whisper, \"As God will!\"\n And in the hottest fire hold still.\n He comes and lays my heart, all heated,\n On the hard anvil, minded so\n Into His own fair shape to beat it\n With His great hammer, blow on blow;\n And yet I whisper, \"As God will!\"\n And at His heaviest blows hold still.\n He takes my softened heart and beats it;\n The sparks fly off at every blow;\n He turns it o\u0027er and o\u0027er and heats it,\n And lets it cool, and makes it glow;\n And yet I whisper, \"As God will!\"\n And in His mighty hand hold still.\n Why should I murmur? for the sorrow\n Thus only longer-lived would be;\n The end may come, and will tomorrow,\n When God has done His work in me;\n So I say trusting, \"As God will!\"\n And, trusting to the end, hold still.\n ━Julius Sturm\n The burden of suffering seems a tombstone hung about our necks, while in reality it is only the weight which is necessary to keep down the diver while he is hunting for pearls. ━Richter\n 七月九日\n “你在苦难的炉中，我拣选你。” （赛四十八：10）\n 感谢神，神给了我们多大的安慰!这真像火焰中忽然来了一阵细雨，又像给我们穿上了一身耐火衣，使火势不能将我们焚伤。苦难阿，你尽管来罢，神已经拣选了我。贫穷阿，疾病阿，你们尽管来袭击我罢，神已经拣选了我。无论甚么患难临到我的时候，我就知道神已经拣选了我。\n 信徒阿，不要惧怕；主是常与你同在的。在你一切猛烈的试炼中，祂的同在是你的慰藉和平安。祂决不会离开祂为自己所拣选的。祂曾允许过：“不要惧怕，因为我与你同在”（创二十六：24）。━司布真\n 苦难的烈火在我心中焚烧，\n 神鼓着风，吹拨火焰，\n 我整个心灵，痛苦得抖泣，\n 在融融的火舌中受着考验；\n 我轻声说：“照神的意思”!\n 在烈火的燃烧时保持信念。\n 祂把我烧得通红的一颗心，\n 放在铁砧上，照祂的意愿，\n 用大铁锤重重敲击，\n 打成像祂那样完美的图案；\n 我轻说：“照神的旨意”！\n 在最重的打击下保持信念。\n 祂拿我烧软的心，再加敲炼，\n 每一锤都有火星飞溅，\n 翻来覆去，先要冷却，\n 一会儿又烧得火光闪闪，\n 我轻说：“照神的意思”！\n 在祂万能的手中保持信念。\n 我决不悲叹埋怨，\n 那无补于苦痛的收敛，\n 神做完了祂的工作，\n 也许明天就结束考验。\n 我虔诚地说：“照神的意思”！\n 我自始至终保持信念。\n ━朱尼斯.史坦 \n 苦难的重负，并不是像挂在我们颈项上的墓碑，乃是像潜水采珠人那样，必须加一些重量，才可以使我们的身体沉到更深的水底。━韦西特\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5260.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
