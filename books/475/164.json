{"id":15121,"no":164,"title":"June 13","content":"\"My own peace I give to you.\" (John 14:27) (Weymouth)\n Two painters each painted a picture to illustrate his conception of rest. The first chose for his scene a still, lone lake among the far-off mountains.\n The second threw on his canvas a thundering waterfall, with a fragile birch tree bending over the foam; and at the fork of the branch, almost wet with the cataract\u0027s spray, sat a robin on its nest.\n The first was only stagnation; the last was rest.\n Christ\u0027s life outwardly was one of the most troubled lives that ever lived: tempest and tumult, tumult and tempest, the waves breaking over it all the time until the worn body was laid in the grave. But the inner life was a sea of glass. The great calm was always there.\n At any moment you might have gone to Him and found rest. And even when the human bloodhounds were dogging Him in the streets of Jerusalem, He turned to His disciples and offered them, as a last legacy, \"My peace.\"\n Rest is not a hallowed feeling that comes over us in church; it is the repose of a heart set deep in God. –Drummond.\n My peace I give in times of deepest grief,\n Imparting calm and trust and My relief.\n My peace I give when prayer seems lost, unheard;\n Know that My promises are ever in My Word.\n My peace I give when thou art left alone--\n The nightingale at night has sweetest tone.\n My peace I give in time of utter loss,\n The way of glory leads right to the cross.\n My peace I give when enemies will blame,\n Thy fellowship is sweet through cruel shame.\n My peace I give in agony and sweat,\n For mine own brow with bloody drops was wet.\n My peace I give when nearest friend betrays--\n Peace that is merged in love, and for them prays.\n My peace I give when there\u0027s but death for thee--\n The gateway is the cross to get to Me.\n --L. S. P.\n 　 　 六月十三日\n “我将我的平安赐给你们”（约十四：27）。\n 　　有两个画家，相约各绘一幅画，表露安息之意。第一个画家画下一个大湖，风静浪平，湖面如镜；山上的美景在水中映得清清楚楚。\n 第二个画家画下一片极大的瀑布，旁边有一棵小灌木的枝子弯在水中；它顶端的分枝上搁着一个小巢（几乎被浪花浸湿），中间睡着一只知更雀。\n 第一幅画仅是停滞；第二幅画才是安息。要有安息，须先有安息的对象。\n 基督在地上的生活，外表无时无刻不在患难和危险之中；可是他里面的生活却是极端安息的。所以十字架就在前面，他仍能对他的门徒说：“我将我的平安赐给你们”。\n 安息并不是我们坐在礼拜堂的那种肃静；安息乃是我们的心在神里面得着休息。——屈伦梦\n 在你最悲痛时，我赐予平安：\n 教导你宁静，坚信，和我的救援。\n 在你祈祷似若无望时，我赐予平安；\n 应知我的话里，永远有我的应许。\n 在你孤立无援时，我赐予平安。\n 夜间的莺声最显得玉润珠圆。\n 在你全功尽弃时，我赐予平安，\n 荣耀之道，通往十字架的凯旋。\n 在你受毁谤时，我赐予平安，\n 残酷的侮辱，加强了你与神的关连。\n 在你流血流汗时，我赐予平安，\n 因为我的额上，也曾血迹斑斑。\n 在你被知己出卖时，我赐予平安，\n 平安生于爱心，为他们祷告上天。\n 在你面临死亡时，我赐予平安，\n 投奔我的关口是十字架的苦难。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5167.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
