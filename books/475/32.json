Fox\\n\\n My child, I have a message for you today; let me whisper it in your ear, that it may gild with glory any storm clouds which may arise, and smooth the rough places upon which you may have to tread. It is short, only five words, but let them sink into your inmost soul; use them as a pillow upon which to rest your weary head. This thing is from ME.\\n\\n Have you ever thought of it, that all that concerns you concerns Me too? For, \"……he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye\" (Zech. 2:8). “…You are very precious in My sight….” (Isa.43:4) Therefore, it is My special delight to educate you.\\n\\n I would have you learn when temptations assail you, and the \"…enemy comes in like a flood,…\"(Is.59:19) that this thing is from Me, that your weakness needs My might, and your safety lies in letting Me fight for you\\n\\n Are you in difficult circumstances, surrounded by people who do not understand you, who never consult your taste, who put you in the background? This thing is from Me. I am the God of circumstances. Thou camest not to thy place by accident, it is the very place God meant for thee.\\n\\n Have you not asked to be made humble? See then, I have placed you in the very school where this lesson is taught; your surroundings and companions are only working out My will.\\n\\n Are you in money difficulties? Is it hard to make both ends meet? This thing is from Me, for I am your purse-bearer and would have you draw from and depend upon Me. My supplies are limitless (Phil.4:19). I would have you prove my promises. Let it not be said of you, \"…In this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God\" (Deut. 1:32).\\n\\n Are you passing through a night of sorrow? This thing is from Me. I am the Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief. I have let earthly comforters fail you, that by turning to Me you may obtain everlasting consolation (2 Thess. 2:16-17). Have you longed to do some great work for Me and instead have been laid aside on a bed of pain and weakness? This thing is from Me. I could not get your attention in your busy days and I want to teach you some of my deepest lessons. \"They also serve who only stand and wait.\" Some of My greatest workers are those shut out from active service, that they may learn to wield the weapon of all-prayer.\\n\\n This day I place in your hand this pot of holy oil. Make use of it free, my child. Let every circumstance that arises, every word that pains you, every interruption that would make you impatient, every revelation of your weakness be anointed with it. The sting will go as you learn to see Me in all things. ━Laura A. Barter Snow\\n\\n \"\u0027This is from Me,\u0027 the Saviour said,\\n\\n As bending low He kissed my brow,\\n\\n \u0027For One who loves you thus has led.\\n\\n Just rest in Me, be patient now,\\n\\n Your Father knows you have need of this,\\n\\n Tho\u0027, why perchance you cannot see.━\\n\\n Grieve not for things you\u0027ve seemed to miss.\\n\\n The thing I send is best for thee.\"\u0027\\n\\n \"Then, looking through my tears, I plead,\\n\\n \u0027Dear Lord, forgive, I did not know,\\n\\n \u0027Twill not be hard since Thou dost tread,\\n\\n Each path before me here below.\\n\\n And for my good this thing must be,\\n\\n His grace sufficient for each test.\\n\\n So still I\u0027ll sing, \"Whatever be\\n\\n God\u0027s way for me is always best.\"\u0027\"\\n\\n 　二月一日\\n\\n 　　 “这事出于我” （王上十二：24）\\n\\n 　　“得意暗藏在失意之中”━福克斯牧师\\n\\n 　　我的孩子，今天我有一个信息传给你；好叫你上面的黑云消散，前面的岖路变平。这个信息是很短的，只有五个字，但是我要你铭刻心中；又把它当作一个枕头来安放你疲倦的头，使你真能高枕无忧。这个信息是甚么呢？就是“这事出于我”。\\n\\n 　　你有没有想到过：凡与你有关的事，也与我有关？因为：“……摸你们的，就是摸我眼中的瞳仁”（亚二：8）；“…我看你为宝，为尊…”（赛四十三：4）。所以，我特别喜欢训练你。\\n\\n 　　当试炼攻击你，“…仇敌好像急流的河水冲来…“（赛五十九：19）的时候，我要你知道“这事出于我”，你的软弱需要我的刚强，你的安全在乎让我替你争战。\\n\\n 　　你是不是正在艰难的环境中，四周的人都不了解你，都不遂你的心意，都看不起你？“这事出于我”。我是管理环境的神。你所处的境遇并非偶然的，都有我的美意在其中的。\\n\\n 　　你不是曾求我给你谦卑吗？你看，我已经把你放在一个学习谦卑的学校里了，你所接触的人和环境是被我利用来成全我的旨意的。\\n\\n 　　你是不是正感觉经济缺乏呢？“这事出于我”，因为我是经营你用度的，我要你向我支取，完全仰赖于我。我的供给是无限的（腓四：19）。我要你证实我的应许，我不愿意你“…在这事上却不信耶和华你们的神”（申一：32）。\\n\\n 　　你是不是整夜忧愁呢？“这事出于我”。我是忧患之子，常经忧患，深知怎样担当忧患的。当你向世人寻求安慰时，我故意叫他们不给你同情，好叫你转向我寻求永远的安慰（帖后二：16-17）。你是不是渴望为我作些伟大的工作，结果倒反卧病在床呢？“这事出于我”。在你忙碌的日子，我不能引起你的注意力来；我要你学习一些更深的功课。事奉不是体贴自己的热心，乃是遵行我的旨意。我有许多顶心腹的仆人，都是关于最冷僻的地方，用祷告事奉我。\\n\\n 　　今天我把这个信息当作一瓶香膏送在你手里。你可以自由敷用。我的孩子，不顺的环境，扎心的毁谤，无故的逼迫等等，临到你的时候，你就敷上这香膏。如果你能在一切事上看见“这事出于我”，所有的痛苦便会立时消失了。━司诺\\n\\n 救世主俯身吻我说：“这是出于我，\\n\\n 引导者故意如此安排。\\n\\n 爱你的，只要耐心信赖我，\\n\\n 天父知道你有此需要，\\n\\n 虽然有时你看不明了。\\n\\n 表面的损失，不必悲伤，\\n\\n 我所赐的，才对你最好。”\\n\\n 于是我睁开泪眼，祷告于天：\\n\\n “亲爱的主，恕我无知，\\n\\n 前面的路，你既都曾走过，\\n\\n 还有什么艰难可言！\\n\\n 这事完全为了有益于我，\\n\\n 神的恩典足以应付每一试炼。\\n\\n 我将继续歌唱：神为我\\n\\n 安排任何道路，总是最好的拣选。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4795.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
