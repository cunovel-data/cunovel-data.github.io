The poet stands by the window watching them. They are beating and buffeting the earth with their fierce downpour. But the poet sees in his imaginings more than the showers which are falling before his eyes. He sees myriads of lovely flowers which shall be soon breaking forth from the watered earth, filling it with matchless beauty and fragrance. And so he sings:\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t raining rain for me, it\u0027s raining daffodils;\\n\\n In every dimpling drop I see wild flowers upon the hills.\\n\\n A cloud of gray engulfs the day, and overwhelms the town;\\n\\n It isn\u0027t raining rain for me: it\u0027s raining roses down.\"\\n\\n Perchance some one of God\u0027s chastened children is even now saying, \"O God, it is raining hard for me tonight.\\n\\n \"Testings are raining upon me which seem beyond my power to endure. Disappointments are raining fast, to the utter defeat of all my chosen plans. Bereavements are raining into my life which are making my shrinking heart quiver in its intensity of suffering. The rain of affliction is surely beating down upon my soul these days.\"\\n\\n Withal, friend, you are mistaken. It isn\u0027t raining rain for you. It\u0027s raining blessing. For, if you will but believe your Father\u0027s Word, under that beating rain are springing up spiritual flowers of such fragrance and beauty as never before grew in that stormless, unchastened life of yours.\\n\\n You indeed see the rain. But do you see also the flowers? You are pained by the testings. But God sees the sweet flower of faith which is upspringing in your life under those very trials.\\n\\n You shrink from the suffering. But God sees the tender compassion for other sufferers which is finding birth in your soul.\\n\\n Your heart winces under the sore bereavement. But God sees the deepening and enriching which that sorrow has brought to you.\\n\\n It isn\u0027t raining afflictions for you. It is raining tenderness, love, compassion, patience, and a thousand other flowers and fruits of the blessed Spirit, which are bringing into your life such a spiritual enrichment as all the fullness of worldly prosperity and ease was never able to beget in your innermost soul. --J. M. McC.\\n\\n SONGS ACROSS THE STORM\\n\\n \"A harp stood in the moveless air,\\n\\n Where showers of sunshine washed a thousand fragrant blooms;\\n\\n A traveler bowed with loads of care\\n\\n Essayed from morning till the dusk of evening glooms\\n\\n To thrum sweet sounds from the songless strings;\\n\\n The pilgrim strives in vain with each unanswering chord,\\n\\n Until the tempest\u0027s thunder sings,\\n\\n And, moving on the storm, the fingers of the Lord\\n\\n A wondrous melody awakes;\\n\\n And though the battling winds their soldier deeds perform,\\n\\n Their trumpet-sound brave music makes\\n\\n While God\u0027s assuring voice sings love across the storm.\"\\n\\n 　 　 六月十五日\\n\\n “因他说，神使我在受苦的地方昌盛”（创四十一：52）。\\n\\n 　　一位诗人站在窗口观望夏天的阵雨，那雨点鞭打着大地，势若倾盆。但在诗人的意念中，他不仅看到的眼前这阵雨，而是雨后无数可爱的花卉，不久从潮润的泥土中萌出嫩芽，给大地增添了无比的美丽和芳香。于是他咏吟道：\\n\\n 这不是下雨，而是下水仙；\\n\\n 每一滴雨珠，把一株野花浇灌，\\n\\n 乌云蔽日，大雨不停如注，\\n\\n 这不是下雨，下的是玫瑰满田。\\n\\n 　　也许此刻正有爱神考验的信徒们说：“神啊，各种试炼，如滂沱大雨，落在我身上，我实无力忍受，各种失望急降在我身上，摧毁了我的希冀的所有计划。各种丧失向我生命倾注，使我畏缩的心灵在剧烈的折磨中发抖。这些日子，痛苦正如雨点似打击我的灵魂。”\\n\\n 　　哦；朋友，你错了。这不是给你下雨，而是降福于你。只要你深信天父不疑，那属灵的花朵，正是在雨后开放，你以前未经风雨，亦未受考验的生命，绝对开不出这样芬芳美丽之花来。\\n\\n 你确实看见了雨，但你也看见了花吗？你因受试炼而痛苦。但神看到在这些试炼之下，你的生命正开放出可爱信心之花。\\n\\n 你畏惧痛苦，但神看到。你同情别一个受苦的温爱，正是这痛苦中孕育出来。\\n\\n 你的心因哀痛而萎缩。但神看到，悲哀使你的意念更为深刻，更为丰富。\\n\\n 这不是给你下痛苦之雨。降的是慈爱，同情，忍耐，和一切圣灵之花，圣灵之果；它们给你的生命注入丰富的灵力，俗世的一切荣华安逸，都不能使你心灵深处得到如此的丰满。\\n\\n 静静的空气里，放着一架竖琴，\\n\\n 阳光遍洒，万花缤纷，\\n\\n 一位吟咏诗人心忧如焚，\\n\\n 从早晨到蒙胧的黄昏，\\n\\n 意欲在弦上弹出曼妙之音，\\n\\n 可是这琴声不能协调，力不从心，\\n\\n 直到暴风雨的雷声来临，\\n\\n 耶和华的手指抚弄风云，\\n\\n 激起了一段奇妙旋律之音，\\n\\n 猛烈的风虽如进攻的大军，\\n\\n 它的呼号却奏出了雄壮声音，\\n\\n 暴风雨中传来神慈爱之歌声。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5169.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
