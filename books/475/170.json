{"id":15127,"no":170,"title":"June 19","content":"\"Bread corn is bruised.\" (Isa. 28:28)\\n\\n Many of us cannot be used to become food for the world\u0027s hunger until we are broken in Christ\u0027s hands. \"Bread corn is bruised.\" Christ\u0027s blessing ofttimes means sorrow, but even sorrow is not too great a price to pay for the privilege of touching other lives with benediction. The sweetest things in this world today have come to us through tears and pain. --J. R. Miller.\\n\\n God has made me bread for His elect, and if it be needful that the bread must be ground in the teeth of the lion to feed His children, blessed be the name of the Lord. --Ignatius.\\n\\n \"We must burn out before we can give out. We cease to bless when we cease to bleed.\"\\n\\n \"Poverty, hardship and misfortune have pressed many a life to moral heroism and spiritual greatness. Difficulty challenges energy and perseverance. It calls into activity the strongest qualities of the soul. It was the weights on father\u0027s old clock that kept it going. Many a head wind has been utilized to make port. God has appointed opposition as an incentive to faith and holy activity.\\n\\n \"The most illustrious characters of the Bible were bruised and threshed and ground into bread for the hungry. Abraham\u0027s diploma styles him as \u0027the father of the faithful.\u0027 That was because he stood at the head of his class in affliction and obedience.\\n\\n \"Jacob suffered severe threshings and grindings. Joseph was bruised and beaten and had to go through Potiphar\u0027s kitchen and Egypt\u0027s prison to get to his throne.\\n\\n \"David, hunted like a partridge on the mountain, bruised, weary and footsore, was ground into bread for a kingdom. Paul never could have been bread for Caesar\u0027s household if he had not endured the bruising, whippings and stonings. He was ground into fine flour for the royal family.\"\\n\\n \"Like combat, like victory. If for you He has appointed special trials, be assured that in His heart He has kept for you a special place. A soul sorely bruised is a soul elect.\"\\n\\n 　 六月十九日\\n\\n “作饼的粮食是用磨磨碎”（赛二十八：28）。\\n\\n 　　我们没有在主的手里被摔碎以前，主不能用我们来做世人的粮食。“作饼使别人的生命得福，那么我们所付的代价价也不算太大了。世上最可爱的东西，往往是从眼泪和痛苦中得来的。——密勒\\n\\n 神已经派定我做他选民的粮食，如果这粮食必须经过狮子牙缝的磨碎才能喂养他儿女的话，我还是感谢赞美他。——意内息斯\\n\\n 世上的英雄，医界的伟人，差不多都是由贫乏，患难，不幸，促成的。因为借着苦难，才会生出毅力和忍耐来。旧式挂钟能摆动的原因，就是因着钟锤有重量。许多时候，我们可以利用暴风的力量，来促进船只的进港。这就是说：神往往利用人的反对，来激进信徒的信心和工作。\\n\\n 　　圣经上最光荣的人物，都是先被磨碎，压伤，然后才成了他人的粮食。亚伯拉罕被称为“信心之父”，是因为他的苦难最多，顺服也最多。雅各也曾遭受过不少难忍的磨练。\\n\\n 　　约瑟必须做过波提乏的仆役，坐过埃及的监狱，才能得到宰相的高位。\\n\\n 　　大卫在山上象鹧鸪般被人追逐——又疲倦，又痛苦，至终却成了全国的粮食。\\n\\n 　　保罗如果没有受过鞭打和石击，也决不会成为该撒家的粮食。他是为王家作磨碎的细粉。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5173.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
