{"id":15196,"no":239,"title":"August 27","content":"\"And he took him aside from the multitude\" (Mark 7:33).\n Paul not only stood the tests in Christian activity, but in the solitude of captivity. You may stand the strain of the most intense labor, coupled with severe suffering, and yet break down utterly when laid aside from all religious activities; when forced into close confinement in some prison house. \n That noble bird, soaring the highest above the clouds and enduring the longest flights, sinks into despair when in a cage where it is forced to beat its helpless wings against its prison bars. You have seen the great eagle languish in its narrow cell with bowed head and drooping wings. What a picture of the sorrow of inactivity. \n Paul in prison. That was another side of life. Do you want to see how he takes it? I see him looking out over the top of his prison wall and over the heads of his enemies. I see him write a document and sign his name--not the prisoner of Festus, nor of Caesar; not the victim of the Sanhedrin; but the--\"prisoner of the Lord.\" (Eph.3:1) He saw only the hand of God in it all. To him the prison becomes a palace. Its corridors ring with shouts of triumphant praise and joy. \n Restrained from the missionary work he loved so well, he now built a new pulpit━a new witness stand━and from that place of bondage come some of the sweetest and most helpful ministries of Christian liberty. What precious messages of light come from those dark shadows of captivity.\n Think of the long train of imprisoned saints who have followed in Paul\u0027s wake. For twelve long years Bunyan\u0027s lips were silenced in Bedford jail. It was there that he did the greatest and best work of his life. There he wrote the book that has been read next to the Bible. He says, \"I was at home in prison and I sat me down and wrote, and wrote, for joy did make me write.\"\n The wonderful dream of that long night has lighted the pathway of millions of weary pilgrims. That sweet-spirited French lady, Madam Guyon, lay long between prison walls. Like some caged birds that sing the sweeter for their confinement, the music of her soul has gone out far beyond the dungeon walls and scattered the desolation of many drooping hearts. \n Oh, the heavenly consolation that has poured forth from places of solitude!--S. G. Rees\n “Taken aside by Jesus,\n To feel the touch of His hand;\n To rest for a while in the shadow,\n Of the Rock in a weary land.”\n “Taken aside by Jesus,\n In the loneliness dark and drear,\n Where no other comfort may reach me,\n Than His voice to my heart so dear.”\n “Taken aside by Jesus,\n To be quite alone with Him,\n To hear His wonderful tones of love,\n Mid the silence and shadows dim.”\n “Taken aside by Jesus,\n Shall I shrink from the desert place;\n When I hear as I never heard before,\n And see Him face to face ?”\n 八月二十七日\n 「耶稣领他离开众人，到一边去。」（可七33）\n 保罗不但在活动的时候忍受了试炼，在被禁的时候也忍受了试炼。我们在最剧烈的劳动下受苦，也许还站得住；但是到了放下一切活动的时候，被监禁在牢狱中的时候，恐怕最容易失败吧！\n 勇敢的小鸟，在翱翔的时候，能高飞直上云霄，忍受长途的辛劳；但是在笼中的时候，却只能垂头丧气地在笼门上拍着无力的翅膀了。你一定看见过：大鹰被幽禁在笼中的时候，是怎样无生气地低着头，垂着翅膀！啊！不活动是一个多么悲哀的景象啊！\n 保罗在监狱中！这是另一面的生活！你要不要看看他在监狱中做甚么呢？他所望的，不是监狱，乃是狱顶上面的天；不是仇敌，乃是仇敌头上顶着的天！我看见他在缮写书信，签上了他的名字━不是非斯都的囚犯，也不是该撒的囚犯；乃是━『基督耶稣的囚犯』（弗三1，直译）。在这一切的事上他只看见神的手。他看监狱为宫殿，所以监狱中满布了胜利的欢呼、赞美和喜乐。\n 被强迫离开了所喜爱的工作，他设立了一个新的讲坛━一个新的见证坛━他的监狱带给了我们一条最甘甜、最有益的自由之路。他在黑暗的拘禁中所带给我们的信息和亮光，是多么可贵啊！\n 保罗之后，曾有好多圣徒入狱。十二年之久，本仁的口，在培特福的监狱中，一声都不准开！但是，在那里他却成功了他一生最伟大最佳美的工作。在那里他著作了一本书━除了圣经以外，最被人诵读的书。他说：「我在监狱中，和在家中一样安适；我一直坐下来写，写，因为喜乐催促我写。」 \n 那个奇异的梦照耀了无数疲劳的旅客的路程。那位精神焕发的法国女士盖恩夫人，也曾许久被囚在监狱中。小鸟常会因受监禁唱出更悦耳的歌来，盖恩夫人心中的音乐也远荡出了牢狱墙外，驱散了人们不少的愁苦与伤心。 \n 哦属天的安慰都是从寂寞中流出来的！－－李斯\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5323.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
