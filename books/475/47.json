{"id":15004,"no":47,"title":"February 16","content":"\"Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.\" (Nah. 1:12)\n There is a limit to affliction. God sends it, and removes it. Do you sigh and say, \"When will the end be?\" Let us quietly wait and patiently endure the will of the Lord till He cometh. Our Father takes away the rod when His design in using it is fully served.\n If the affliction is sent for testing us, that our graces may glorify God, it will end when the Lord has made us bear witness to His praise.\n We would not wish the affliction to depart until God has gotten out of us all the honor which we can possibly yield Him. There may be today \"a great calm.\" Who knows how soon those raging billows will give place to a sea of glass, and the sea birds sit on the gentle waves?\n After long tribulation, the flail is hung up, and the wheat rests in the garner. We may, before many hours are past, be just as happy as now we are sorrowful.\n It is not hard for the Lord to turn night into day. He that sends the clouds can as easily clear the skies. Let us be of good cheer. It is better farther on. Let us sing Hallelujah by anticipation. ━C. H. Spurgeon.\n The great Husbandman is not always threshing. Trial is only for a season. The showers soon pass. Weeping may tarry only for the few hours of the short summer night; it must be gone at daybreak. Our light affliction is but for a moment. Trial is for a purpose, \"If needs be.\"\n The very fact of trial proves that there is something in us very precious to our Lord; else He would not spend so much pains and time on us. Christ would not test us if He did not see the precious ore of faith mingled in the rocky matrix of our nature; and it is to bring this out into purity and beauty that He forces us through the fiery ordeal.\n Be patient, O sufferer! The result will more than compensate for all our trials, when we see how they wrought out the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. To have one word of God\u0027s commendation; to be honored before the holy angels; to be glorified in Christ, so as to be better able to flash His glory on Himself━ah! that will more than repay for all. ━Tried by Fire.\n As the weights of the clock, or the ballast in the vessel, are necessary for their right ordering, so is trouble in the soul-life. The sweetest scents are only obtained by tremendous pressure; the fairest flowers grow amid Alpine snow-solitudes; the fairest gems have suffered longest from the lapidary\u0027s wheel; the noblest statues have borne most blows of the chisel. All, however, are under law. Nothing happens that has not been appointed with consummate care and foresight. ━Daily Devotional Commentary　\n 二月十六日\n “我虽然使你受苦，却不再使你受苦”（鸿一：12）\n 　　受苦是有限制的。神能使你受苦，也能免去你受苦。读者啊，你岂不是在叹息说：“要受苦到几时方纔停止呢？”哦，让我们耐心等待，直到神的旨意成功。当父用杖的目的完成以后，我们的父自然会把杖挪去的。\n 　　神使我们受苦，若是目的为要试验我们，要我们在受苦中靠恩典荣耀祂，那么，必须等到我们在人前有了明显的见证之后，苦难纔会停止。\n 　　我们不该盼望苦难早些离去，除非神已经从我们得到了我们该给祂的一切荣耀和尊贵。也许今天就会有平安。谁知道波浪翻腾的海顷刻之间就会变成平静如镜，让海鸟在波上滑翔呢？\n 　　农夫经历了许多艰难之后，犁和镰可以藏起来了，禾可以扎成捆收在仓里了。那时我们都要欢喜快乐了。\n 　　在神不难将黑夜变成白昼。祂能将黑云密布天空，祂也能很容易地使天气清朗。所以让我们放心罢。苦难终究是要过去的。让我们预先唱哈利路亚罢。━司布真\n 　　农夫不会一直打谷的，神也不会一直用杖的。试炼不过是暂时的。目前虽然有暴雨，不久却要停止的。一宿虽然有哭泣，早晨便必欢呼。因为祂的怒气不过是转眼之间，祂的恩典乃是一生之久。我们这至轻的苦楚，乃是至暂的。并且这至暂的苦楚也是有目标的━为要完成我们永远的荣耀。\n 　　信徒受试炼，就是证明我们在主面前的宝贵；不然主不会花这许多时间，力气和心机在我们身上的。主决不会来试炼我们，除非祂发现我们有顶宝贵的信心的矿苗，混在我们肉体的砂石中，祂要把我们纯粹的信心提出来，就必须放我们在试炼的炉火中。\n 　　哦，受苦的信徒们阿，耐着罢！将来我们所得的酬报，将远超过现在所出的代价。在万王之王的面前得称赞；在千万圣天使面前受尊敬；在基督里得荣耀；在国度和永世里戴冠冕，操铁杖，坐宝座━坐王，直到永远。阿，这是何等的赏赐呢！━译自火的试炼\n 　　时鸣钟上的钟锤，是使时鸣钟走得准确的必需品；照样，患难也是属灵生命的必需品。香料越压得紧，香气越是浓郁；最美丽的花卉，是生长在荒僻的雪地里的；最精美的宝石，受匠人琢磨的时间最长；最贵重的雕刻，受凿子的击打最多。这是一个定律。任何事物的完成，都要经过远见高大而无微不至的磨炼。━日诚报\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4862.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
