{"id":15024,"no":67,"title":"March 8","content":"\"Do as thou hast said, that thy name may be magnified forever.\" (1 Chron. 17:23, 24) This is a most blessed phase of true prayer. Many a time we ask for things which are not absolutely promised. We are not sure therefore until we have persevered for some time whether our petitions are in the line of God\u0027s purpose or no. There are other occasions, and in the life of David this was one, when we are fully persuaded that what we ask is according to God\u0027s will. We feel led to take up and plead some promise from the page of Scripture, under the special impression that it contains a message for us. At such times, in confident faith, we say, \"Do as Thou hast said.\" There is hardly any position more utterly beautiful, strong, or safe, than to put the finger upon some promise of the Divine word, and claim it. There need be no anguish, or struggle, or wrestling; we simply present the check and ask for cash, produce the promise, and claim its fulfillment; nor can there be any doubt as to the issue. It would give much interest to prayer, if we were more definite. It is far better to claim a few things specifically than a score vaguely. --F. B. Meyer. Every promise of Scripture is a writing of God, which may be pleaded before Him with this reasonable request: \"Do as Thou hast said.\" The Creator will not cheat His creature who depends upon His truth; and far more, the Heavenly Father will not break His word to His own child. \"Remember the word unto thy servant, on which thou hast caused me to hope,\" is most prevalent pleading. It is a double argument: it is Thy Word. Wilt Thou not keep it? Why hast thou spoken of it, if Thou wilt not make it good. Thou hast caused me to hope in it, wilt Thou disappoint the hope which Thou has Thyself begotten in me? --C. H. Spurgeon. \"Being absolutely certain that whatever promise he is bound by, he is able also to make good.\" (Rom. 4:21, Weymouth\u0027s Translation) It is the everlasting faithfulness of God that makes a Bible promise \"exceeding great and precious.\" Human promises are often worthless. Many a broken promise has left a broken heart. But since the world was made, God has never broken a single promise made to one of His trusting children. Oh, it is sad for a poor Christian to stand at the door of the promise, in the dark night of affliction, afraid to draw the latch, whereas he should then come boldly for shelter as a child into his father\u0027s house. --Gurnal. Every promise is built upon four pillars: God\u0027s justice and holiness, which will not suffer Him to deceive; His grace or goodness, which will not suffer Him to forget; His truth, which will not suffer Him to change, which makes Him able to accomplish. --Selected. 　 三月八日 “求你...照你所说的而行。愿你的名永远...被尊为大”(代上十七：23/24)。 　　这是一个真信的祷告的样本。许多时侯，我们所求的，并不是神所应许的。　因此我们一时不会明白我们的祷告是否合乎神的旨意。大卫在这里的祷告，告诉我们，他深信所求的应许；在这种时候，我们只须带着信心，用手指按着那应许祈求神说：“求你照你所说的而行”。这是最美丽，最有力，最稳妥的祷告。用不着焦急，用不着苦求，用不着挣扎；我们只要拿出支票来兑现就是了——拿出应许来，要求实践。这样必会增加我们祷告的兴趣。求一件神的应许，远胜求一百件不清楚神旨的事情。——梅尔 　　圣经中每一个应许，都是神亲笔签字的，我们都可以去要求：“求你照你所说的而行”。创造者决不会欺骗信靠他的受造者；天上的父决不会对他自己的孩子失信。 　　“求你记念向你仆人从所应许的那叫我有盼望的话”(诗一一九：49直译),是一个最有力的祷告。他给神的理由是:这是你的话,你岂不守信吗？如果你不实践,又何必说呢？你既叫我在你的话上有盼望,难道有使我失去你自己所给我的盼望吗?——司布真 　　“且满心相信,　神所应许的必能作成”(罗四：21)。 　　神的永久信实使圣经中的应许“又宝贵,又极大”(彼后一：4)。人的应许常是一无价值的。许多毁约使人碎心。但是神从创世以来,　从没有向他的孩子失过一次信。 　　哦，一个基督徒在痛苦之夜站在应许的门口，不敢拿门闩，这是何等可怜呢？他应该放胆进去，尤如一个孩子进父亲的家一般。 　　神每一个应许都是建立在四个根基上的：神的公义，神的圣洁，神的恩典，神的真实。神的公义，不让他失信；神的圣洁，不让他欺骗；神的恩典，不让他遗忘；神的真实，不让他改变","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5003.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
