{"id":15219,"no":262,"title":"September 19","content":"\"My Father is the husbandman\" (John 15:1). It is comforting to think of trouble, in whatever form it may come to, us, as a heavenly messenger, bringing us something from God. In its earthly aspect it may seem hurtful, even destructive; but in its spiritual out-working it yields blessing. Many of the richest blessings which have come down to us from the past are the fruit of sorrow or pain. We should never forget that redemption, the world\u0027s greatest blessing, is the fruit of the world\u0027s greatest sorrow. In every time of sharp pruning, when the knife is deep and the pain is sore, it is an unspeakable comfort to read, \"My Father is the husbandman.\" Doctor Vincent tells of being in a great hothouse where luscious clusters of grapes were hanging on every side. The owner said, \"When my new gardener came, he said he would have nothing to do with these vines unless he could cut them clean down to the stalk; and he did, and we had no grapes for two years, but this is the result.\" There is rich suggestiveness in this interpretation of the pruning process, as we apply it to the Christian life. Pruning seems to be destroying the vine, the gardener appears to be cutting it all away; but he looks on into the future and knows that the final outcome will be the enrichment of its life and greater abundance of fruit. There are blessings we can never have unless we are ready to pay the price of pain. There is no way to reach them save through suffering. --Dr. Miller. “I walked at mile with Pleasure, She chattered all the way; But left me none the wiser For all she had to say.” “I walked at mile with Sorrow, And ne\u0027er a word said she; But, oh, the things I learned from her When sorrow walked with me.” 九月十九日 「我父是栽培的人。」（约十五1） 临到我们的各种苦难，都是父神的使者，受父神的差遣，送礼物来给我们的；我们如果知道这个，就会得到安慰了。虽然照属世的眼光看来，苦难似乎是伤害我们、毁灭我们的；但是照属灵的眼光看来，苦难却是产生祝福。我们永不该忘记：救恩━世上最大的祝福━乃是世上最大痛苦的结果。所以每一次我们受到神严厉的修剪，刀虽然割得深，痛虽然刺得剧，但是一想到「我父是栽培的人」，立刻会得到说不尽的安慰。 闻声博士在一个挂满了葡萄的花房里讲说他的故事：「我的园丁新来的时候，告诉我说这些葡萄藤若不一起割光，祇留下藤茎的话，他对它们一点办法都没有了；我就让他去割；两年我们一粒葡萄也吃不到，可是到了今年，竟长得这般丰满。」 让我们拿这个故事来解释基督人受修剪的经过。修剪好像把葡萄藤剪坏了，园丁好像把葡藤割光了；但是他所顾念的是将来，他知道这样修剪的结果会使它的生命更丰盛，它的果子更饶多。 有许多祝福，若不出代价，是永远得不到的。－－密勒","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5410.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
