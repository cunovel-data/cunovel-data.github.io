{"id":15262,"no":305,"title":"November 1","content":"“When the cloud tarried…then the children of Israel…journeyed not” (Num. 9:19)\n This was the supreme test of obedience. It was comparatively easy to strike tents, when the fleecy folds of the cloud were slowly gathering from off the Tabernacle, and it floated majestically before the host. Change is always delightful; and there was excitement and interest in the route, the scenery, and the locality of the next halting-place. But, ah, the tarrying.\n Then, however uninviting and sultry the location, however trying to flesh and blood, however irksome to the impatient disposition, however perilously exposed to danger--there was no option but to remain encamped.\n The Psalmist says, \"I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.\" (Ps.40:1) And what He did for the Old Testament saints He will do for believers throughout all ages.\n Still God often keeps us waiting. Face to face with threatening foes, in the midst of alarms, encircled by perils, beneath the impending rock. May we not go? Is it not time to strike our tents? Have we not suffered to the point of utter collapse? May we not exchange the glare and heat for green pastures and still waters?\n There is no answer. The cloud tarries, and we must remain, though sure of manna, rock-water, shelter, and defense. God never keeps us at post without assuring us of His presence, and sending us daily supplies.\n Wait, young man, do not be in a hurry to make a change! Minister, remain at your post! Until the cloud clearly moves, you must tarry. Wait, then, thy Lord\u0027s good pleasure! He will be in plenty of time!--Daily Devotional Commentary\n An hour of waiting !\n Yet there seems such need\n To reach that spot sublime !\n I long to reach them━but I long far more\n To trust HIS time !\n “Sit still, my daughter”—(Ruth3:18)\n Yet the heathen die,\n They perish while I stay !\n I long to reach them━but I long far more\n To trust HIS way !\n ‘Tis good to get,\n ‘Tis good indeed to give !\n Yet is it better still—\n O’er breadth, thro’length, up height,\n To trust HIS will !\n ━F.M.N.\n 十一月一日\n 「云彩……停留……以色列人……不起行。」（民九:19）\n 「不起行」比「起行」更难顺服。为甚么呢？因为人的天性都是喜欢动的──拆帐棚、探新奇；云彩缓缓地收上去，威风凛凛地行在他们前头….啊，多么威武！路上有兴奋、有美景，多么有趣！可是一到了云彩停留的时候，他们也只得停留了。\n 无论云彩停留的的地方多么讨厌、多么炎热；他们的肉体多么难堪、多么急躁；停留的地方多么危险、多么荒凉；他们没有选择的权利，他们只得耐性等候。\n 戴维说：「我曾耐性等候耶和华。祂垂听我的呼求。」（诗四十:1）戴维得到耶和华的「垂听」，是「曾耐性等候」的。神怎样对待旧约时代的信徒，也会照样对待新约时代的信徒。\n 眞的，神常喜欢叫我们等候，当我们面对面遇见可怕的仇敌的时候在惊恐之中，危险之下，我们就求问神说：「神阿，我们可不可以跑开一点呢？现在岂不是拆帐棚的时候了么？我们岂不已受尽了痛苦和失败么？我可不可以暂时逃避一下炎热，往青草地上和可安歇的水边去休息一下呢？」\n 没有回音！云彩停留了，我们也只得停在那里；但是无论如何，路上吗哪、活水、保护、安慰是一定有的。神从来不叫我们停在一个地方，而不给我们祂的同在和日常的供给的。\n 小子哪，你当耐性等候，不要匆匆向前冲去！停留在你原来的地位上！直到云彩清清楚楚地向上收去。因为这是你的主所喜悦的！祂是不会使你「太迟」的！──译自日诚报\n 再等一个钟头的时间,\n 而我好像急需,\n 到达了那荣耀的顶巅,\n 我虽渴望如此,\n 但我更愿遵从祂的时间。\n “女儿啊!你只管安坐等待”,(得三:18)\n 在等待之时,我愿\n 清除邪教徒的战役奏凯,\n 我虽渴望如此,\n 但我更愿遵从祂是主宰。\n 不论是取,还是给,\n 都有它的优点,\n 但更好的是:\n 用你的全心全力,\n 遵从祂的旨意。\n ━F.M.N.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5540.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
