Hence my hope for you is well-founded, since I know that as you share the sufferings you share the comfort also\"(2 Cor. 1:6-7)\n Are there not some in your circle to whom you naturally betake yourself in times of trial and sorrow? They always seem to speak the right word, to give the very counsel you are longing for; you do not realize, however, the cost which they had to pay ere they became so skillful in binding up the gaping wounds and drying tears. But if you were to investigate their past history you would find that they have suffered more than most. They have watched the slow untwisting of some silver cord on which the lamp of life hung. They have seen the golden bowl of joy dashed to their feet, and its contents spilt. They have stood by ebbing tides, and drooping gourds, and noon sunsets; but all this has been necessary to make them the nurses, the physicians, the priests of men. The boxes that come from foreign climes are clumsy enough; but they contain spices which scent the air with the fragrance of the Orient. So suffering is rough and hard to bear; but it hides beneath it discipline, education, possibilities, which not only leave us nobler, but perfect us to help others. Do not fret, or set your teeth, or wait doggedly for the suffering to pass; but get out of it all you can, both for yourself and for your service to your generation, according to the will of God. ━Selected\n Once I heard a song of sweetness,\n As it cleft the morning air,\n Sounding in its blest completeness,\n Like a tender, pleading prayer;\n And I sought to find the singer,\n Whence the wondrous song was borne;\n And I found e bird, sore wounded,\n Pinioned by a cruel thorn.\n I have seen a soul in sadness,\n While its wings toith pain were furl\u0027d,\n Giving hope, and cheer and gladness\n That should bless a weeping world;\n And I knew that life of sweetness,\n Was of pain and sorrow borne,\n And a stricken soul was singing,\n With its heart against a thorn.\n Ye are told of One who loved you,\n Of a Saviour crucified,\n Ye are told of nails that pinioned,\n And a spear that pierced His side;\n Ye are told of cruel scourging,\n Of a Saviour bearing scorn,\n And He died for your salvation,\n With His brow against a thorn.\n Ye \"are not above the Master.”\n Will you breathe a sweet refrain?\n And His grace will be sufficient,\n When your heart is pierced with pain.\n Will you live to bless His loved ones,\n Tho\u0027your life be bruised and torn,\n Like the bird that sang so sweetly,\n With its heart against a thorn?\n ━Selected \n 十二月十日 \n 「我们受患难呢，是为叫你们得安慰……这安慰能叫你们忍受我们所受的那样苦楚。我们为你们所存的盼望是确定的。因为知道你们既是同受苦楚、也必同得安慰。」 （林后一:6-7） \n 在你四围有没有甚么人是特别会帮助你，你在试炼中、忧伤中，特别会去向他寻求安慰呢？这个人每次所说的话，都顶能帮助你，顶合你的需要。你知道他是顶会帮助你，但是你知不知道他怎样会是的呢？他这样会扎缚人的伤口、揩干人的眼泪，绝非偶然的事，乃是曾出了重大代价的。如果你去调查他以往的历史，你就会发现他曾受过多少苦难。他曾亲见他喜乐的金碗被摔在地上，他曾站在怒潮旁边、烈日之下；但是这一切都是他成为保姆、医生，所必需经历的。苦难固然顶难忍受；可是底下却隐藏着顶宝贵的教育━教导我们怎样帮助别人。所以信徒阿，你不要动怒，你不要咬牙，你只要看见这是训练你成为一个安慰使者的；因此你当甘甘心心在神的旨意里面忍受。━选\n 某日我听见一阵悦耳的歌声,\n 在清晨的空气中萦绕,\n 完美无瑕的嗓音。 \n 宛如一篇温柔恳切的祷告。 \n 我去寻找那位歌唱者,\n 谁能唱得如此美妙； \n 我发现一只鸟为荆棘所刺,\n 在受伤中婉转鸣叫。 \n 我曾见到一个悲恸的生灵,\n 卷缩着疼痛的翅膀,\n 他祝福这流泪啼泣的世界,\n 散播着欢欣鼓励和希望。 \n 我知道可爱的生命,\n 来自痛苦和悲伤； \n 这一个受了击打的灵魂,\n 心里带着荆棘而歌唱。 \n 你曾听说爱你的救主,\n 被钉十字架的故事； \n 你曾听说那无情的尖钉,\n 和戳穿祂胁肋的矛刺； \n 你曾听说那残酷的鞭笞,\n 这位救主如何忍辱至死； \n 祂带着刺痛额上的荆棘,\n 为救赎你我而去世。 \n 你「不能高过先生。」 \n 你可愿意哼唱甜美的歌声?\n 当你的心受着刺痛,\n 祂的恩典足够给你温暖。 \n 虽然你的生命受了伤,\n 你可愿意祝福祂所爱的子民,\n 像那只心里带荆棘的鸟,\n 唱出那样悦耳的清吟?\n ━━选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5579.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
