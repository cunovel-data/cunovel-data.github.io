{"id":14988,"no":31,"title":"January 31","content":"\"He giveth quietness.\" (Job 34:29) \n \n Quietness amid the dash of the storm. We sail the lake with Him still; and as we reach its middle waters, far from land, under midnight skies, suddenly a great storm sweeps down. Earth and hell seem arrayed against us, and each billow threatens to overwhelm. Then He arises from His sleep, and rebukes the winds and the waves; His hand waves benediction and repose over the rage of the tempestuous elements. His voice is heard above the scream of the wind in the cordage and the conflict of the billows, \"Peace, be still!\" Can you not hear it? And there is instantly a great calm. \"He giveth quietness.\" Quietness amid the loss of inward consolations. He sometimes withdraws these, because we make too much of them. We are tempted to look at our joy, our ecstasies, our transports, or our visions, with too great complacency. Then love for love\u0027s sake, withdraws them. But, by His grace, He leads us to distinguish between them and Himself. He draws nigh, and whispers the assurance of His presence. Thus an infinite calm comes to keep our heart and mind. \"He giveth quietness.\" \n \n \"He giveth quietness.\" O Elder Brother, \n \n Whose homeless feet have pressed our path of pain, \n \n Whose hands have borne the burden of our sorrow, \n \n That in our losses we might find our gain. \n \n \"Of all Thy gifts and infinite consolings, \n \n I ask but this: in every troubled hour \n \n To hear Thy voice through all the tumults stealing, \n \n And rest serene beneath its tranquil power. \n \n \"Cares cannot fret me if my soul be dwelling \n \n In the still air of faith\u0027s untroubled day; \n \n Grief cannot shake me if I walk beside thee, \n \n My hand in Thine along the darkening way. \n \n \"Content to know there comes a radiant morning \n \n When from all shadows I shall find release, \n \n Serene to wait the rapture of its dawning— \n \n Who can make trouble when Thou sendest peace?\" \n \n 一月三十一日 \n \n “祂使人安静“ （伯三十四：29） \n \n 　　神能在风浪中给人安静。今天我们仍旧和祂一同在船中；在深夜离岸甚远，船到了湖中心的时候，忽然起了暴风，甚至船被波浪掩盖。这时候似乎世人联络一致地逼迫我们，地狱张了口等待吞吃我们，每一个波浪威胁我们。在这样绝望的光景中，主顶镇静地起来，斥责风和浪。在祂一挥手之下，祝福来了，风浪去了，风号浪湃，不能混乱祂的声音，“住了罢，静了罢”（可四：39）。你听见祂的声音么？“祂使人安静“。这安静不是普通的安静，乃是在失去指望和安慰中的安静。有时候祂故意把指望和安慰从我们收回，因为我们太注重这些了。我们顶容易专看喜乐，奋心，盼望，安慰，经历，恩赐，异象等等过于看主。所以为了爱的缘故，主把这些暂时收回；好叫我们靠着祂的恩典，分辨主所赐的和主自己。但是当我们以为失去了一切福份的时候，主就来了，叫我们尝到祂同在的滋味。这时候我们因为有了祂自己，就忘记了祂所收回的，心中只觉得无限的安静。“祂使人安静”。 \n \n “祂使人安静” \n \n 基督流浪的脚步，曾踏过我们痛苦的荒径， \n \n 祂的双手担承过我们悲愁的重负， \n \n 祂使人安宁，丧失之中找到新的生命。 \n \n 在祢一切的赐予和无尽的安慰中， \n \n 我只祈求：在遭遇困难的时际， \n \n 听到祢的声音隐隐穿过一切喧嚣， \n \n 使我在它安静的力量下泰然休憩。 \n \n 只要我灵魂寓于平静的信仰， \n \n 一切忧虑都不能使我心焦， \n \n 只要祢握着我的手，我走在祢身旁， \n \n 一切悲痛都不能使我动摇。 \n \n 光明的早晨将使黑暗消散， \n \n 知道了这一点，我已心满意足， \n \n 我将静待黎明时分的狂喜， \n \n 谁还能扰乱祢所赐的安宁平静？ \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4852.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
