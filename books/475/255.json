{"id":15212,"no":255,"title":"September 12","content":"\"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?\" (S. of Sol. 8:5).\n Some one gained a good lesson from a Southern prayer meeting. A brother asked the Lord for various blessings--as you and I do, and thanked the Lord for many already received--as you and I do; but he closed with this unusual petition: \"And, O Lord, support us! Yes support us Lord on every leanin\u0027 side!\" Have you any leaning sides? This humble man\u0027s prayer pictures them in a new way and shows the Great Supporter in a new light also. He is always walking by the Christian, ready to extend His mighty arm and steady the weak one on \"every leanin\u0027 side.\" —Selected\n “Child of My love, lean hard,\n And let Me feel the pressure of thy care;\n I know; thy burden, child. I shaped it;\n Poised it in Mine Own hand; made no proportion\n In its weight to thine unaided strength,\n For even as I laid it on, I said,\n I shall be near, and while she leans on Me,\n This burden shall be Mine, not hers;\n So shall I keep My child within the circling arms\n Of My Own love. Here lay it down, nor fear\n To impose it on a shoulder which upholds\n the government of worlds. Yet closer come:\n Thou art not near enough. I would embrace thy care;\n So I might feel My child reposing on My breast.\n Thou lovest Me? I knew it. Doubt not then;\n But Loving Me, lean hard.” \n 九月十二日\n 「那靠着良人从旷也上来的，是谁呢？」（歌八5）\n 一次，我在一个祈祷会中，学到了一课有益的功课。有一位弟兄，起来祷告，求神赐各种祝福给我们－－正如你我所求的；他也为着已经得到的感谢神－－正如你我所感谢的；但是，在他结束的时候，他加上了一个奇妙的请求。他说：「哦，主阿，撑住我们！是的，主阿，在我们所靠的每一边撑住我们！」亲爱的读者，你有没有可倚靠的主呢？这位弟兄，用一个新的方法，把我们所倚靠的描写清楚了；他对我们所倚靠的主，有了新的亮光，他也把这个亮光，介绍给我们了。读者，主是时时在信徒旁边的，祂随时都能张开祂仁爱的双臂来撑住软弱的信徒。－－选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5403.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
