They were first made without wings. Then God made the wings and put them down before the wingless birds and said to them, \"Come, take up these burdens and bear them.\"\\n\\n The birds had lovely plumage and sweet voices; they could sing, and their feathers gleamed in the sunshine, but they could not soar in the air. They hesitated at first when bidden to take up the burdens that lay at their feet, but soon they obeyed, and taking up the wings in their beaks, laid them on their shoulders to carry them.\\n\\n For a little while the load seemed heavy and hard to bear, but presently, as they went on carrying the burdens, folding them over their hearts, the wings grew fast to their little bodies, and soon they discovered how to use them, and were lifted by them up into the air━the weights became wings.\\n\\n It is a parable. We are the wingless birds, and our duties and tasks are the pinions God has made to lift us up and carry us heavenward. We look at our burdens and heavy loads, and shrink from them; but as we lift them and bind them about our hearts, they become wings, and on them we rise and soar toward God.\\n\\n There is no burden which, if we lift it cheerfully and bear it with love in our hearts, will not become a blessing to us. God means our tasks to be our helpers; to refuse to bend our shoulders to receive a load, is to decline a new opportunity for growth. ━J. R. Miller\\n\\n Blessed is any weight, however overwhelming, which God has been so good as to fasten with His own hand upon our shoulders. ━F. W. Faber \\n\\n 七月八日 \\n\\n “他们必如鹰展翅上腾。” （赛四十：31）\\n\\n 相传有一个寓言，说鸟类最初被造的时候，是没有翅膀的。神将翅膀造好了放在牠们面前，对牠们说：“来，戴起这些翅膀来”。\\n\\n 那时的鸟类也有丰美的羽毛和悦耳的歌喉；牠们戴起翅膀来的时候，牠们起初还不大愿意，但是不久就服从了，用嘴尖啄起翅膀来，安在肩头上。\\n\\n 起初，肩头上的担子似乎很重，背着也很费力，但是不一会，牠们将翅膀展开，觉察了利用翅膀的方法，于是就能高飞空中━啊，重担变成了翅膀！\\n\\n 读者，这是一个比喻，我们就是那些无翅的小鸟，我们的工作和职务是神替我们预备带领我们向天的翅翼。我们也顶会望着我们面前的重担畏缩；但是只要我们一挑起那担子来，它们便会变成我们的翅膀，藉着牠们我们便能飞向神去。\\n\\n 如果我们高高兴兴地用爱心负起一切重担来，我告诉你，没有一件重担不能变成我们的福祉。神原命定我们的工作来做我们的帮助的；所以读者阿，拒绝一个重担，就是拒绝一个新的生机。━密勒\\n\\n 凡是神亲手系在我们肩头上的重担，无论怎样沉重，都是可喜爱的。━费勃尔\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5259.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
