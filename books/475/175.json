{"id":15132,"no":175,"title":"June 24","content":"\"Concerning the work of my hands command ye me.\" (Isa. 45:11)\n Our Lord spoke in this tone when He said, \"Father, I will.\" Joshua used it when, in the supreme moment of triumph, he lifted up his spear toward the setting sun, and cried, \"Sun, stand thou still!\"\n Elijah used it when he shut the heavens for three years and six months, and again opened them.\n Luther used it when, kneeling by the dying Melanchthon, he forbade death to take his prey.\n It is a marvelous relationship into which God bids us enter. We are familiar with words like those which follow in this paragraph: \"I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.\" But that God should invite us to command Him, this is a change in relationship which is altogether startling!\n What a difference there is between this attitude and the hesitating, halting, unbelieving prayers to which we are accustomed, and which by their perpetual repetition lose edge and point!\n How often during His earthly life did Jesus put men into a position to command Him! When entering Jericho, He stood still, and said to the blind beggars:\n \"What will ye that I shall do unto you?\" It was as though He said, \"I am yours to command.\"\n Can we ever forget how He yielded to the Syrophenician woman the key to His resources and told her to help herself even as she would?\n What mortal mind can realize the full significance of the position to which our God lovingly raises His little children? He seems to say, \"All my resources are at your command.\" \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do.\" --F. B. Meyer.\n Say to this mountain, \"Go,\n Be cast into the sea\";\n And doubt not in thine heart\n That it shall be to thee.\n It shall be done, doubt not His Word,\n Challenge thy mountain in the Lord!\n Compass the frowning wall\n With silent prayer, then raise--\n Before its ramparts fall--\n The victor\u0027s shout of praise.\n It shall be done, faith rests assured,\n Challenge thy mountain in the Lord!\n The two-leaved gates of brass,\n The bars of iron yield,\n To let the faithful pass,\n Conquerors in every field.\n It shall be done, the foe ignored,\n Challenge thy mountain in the Lord!\n Take then the faith of God,\n Free from the taint of doubt;\n The miracle-working rod\n That casts all reasoning out.\n It shall be done, stand on the Word,\n Challenge thy mountain in the Lord! \n --Selected.\n 　 六月二十四日\n “……我手的工作，你们可以吩咐我”（赛四十五：11）。\n 　　神说：“你们可以吩咐我”。这是何等的权利！我们可以吩咐神吗？可以。主耶稣在世的时候，曾享受过这样的权利；约书亚，马丁路得…都曾享受过这样的权利。\n 　　约书亚在大获胜利的时候，举起他的枪来对着将落的日头，大声喊叫说：“日头啊，你要停在基遍”（书十：12）。他说话的语气多么勇敢！多有把握！\n 　　以利亚三年零六个月封闭了天——使天闭塞不下雨；然后，又将天打开——求下雨来。他在神面前是多么勇敢！\n 　　马丁路得跪在将死的麦兰基登(Melanchthon)旁边，大声禁止死神夺去他亲爱的朋友。他又是多么勇敢呢！\n 　　亲爱的读者，神允许我们与他发生了多么奇妙的关系！我们平常只知道神曾说过：“我亲手铺张诸天，天上万象也是我所命定的”（赛四十五：12）。但是现在我们却看见神叫我们去吩咐神！命令神！这是颠倒次序！多么奇怪呢！\n 　 我们平常祷告的态度——狐疑，踌躇，不信——和主耶稣、约书亚、以利亚、马丁路得…祷告的态度——坚决，勇敢，深信——是多么不同啊！我们的祷告时常会变成重复，以致失去锐利。\n 　 主耶稣在世的时候，常给人们机会去吩咐他！当他将近耶利哥的时候，站住，问那讨饭的瞎子说：\n “你要我为你做什么”？（路十八：41）他似乎说：“你可以吩咐我”。\n 我们当然不会忘记，主如何接受希利尼妇人的祈求，告诉她可以如愿以偿。（可七：26）\n 　 人类有限的头脑，怎能领会慈爱的父神所给我们的地位呢？神似乎说：“我一切所有的，你们可以吩咐。”“你们奉我的名，无论求什么，我必成就”（约十四：13）。——梅尔\n 对这山说：“快快移开\n 投在海里”。\n 倘若一点没有怀疑，\n 山就会移到海底。\n 只要信，事必成就，\n 凭主扫除这一块污泥。\n 围绕那坚固的城堡，\n 作默默的祈祷，\n 发出赞美的欢呼，\n 堡垒会立刻塌倒。\n 只要信，事必成就，\n 凭主把山投入白浪洪涛。\n 毁弃铁的栏栅，\n 打开那紧闭的双扉，\n 让信徒们通过，\n 到处获得全胜，\n 这事必成，仇敌于我何有？\n 凭主叫山移开此地。\n 把握忠于神的坚信，\n 丝毫不留一点疑义，\n 那根行奇迹的杖，\n 能驱除意念之间的障碍。\n 接受神的话，事必成就，\n 凭主叫山移开此地。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5178.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
