{"id":15220,"no":263,"title":"September 20","content":"\"Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\"\\n\\n Mary and Martha could not understand what their Lord was doing. Both of them said to Him, \"Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\" Back of it all, we seem to read their thought: \"Lord, we do not understand why you have stayed away so long. We do not understand how you could let death come to the man whom you loved. We do not understand how you could let sorrow and suffering ravage our lives when your presence might have stayed it all. Why did you not come? It is too late now, for already he has been dead four days!\" \\n\\n And to it all Jesus had but one great truth: \"You may not understand; but I tell you if you believe, you will see.\" \\n\\n Abraham could not understand why God should ask the sacrifice of the boy; but he trusted. And he saw the glory of God in his restoration to his love. Moses could not understand why God should keep him forty years in the wilderness, but he trusted; and he saw when God called him to lead forth Israel from bondage. \\n\\n Joseph could not understand the cruelty of his brethren, the false witness of a perfidious woman, and the long years of an unjust imprisonment; but he trusted, and he saw at last the glory of God in it all. \\n\\n Jacob could not understand the strange providence which permitted the same Joseph to be torn from his father\u0027s love, but he saw the glory of God when he looked into the face of that same Joseph as the viceroy of a great king, and the preserver of his own life and the lives of a great nation. \\n\\n And so, perhaps in your life. You say, \"I do not understand why God let my dear one be taken. I do not understand why affliction has been permitted to smite me. I do not understand the devious paths by which the Lord is leading me. I do not understand why plans and purposes that seemed good to my eyes should be baffled. I do not understand why blessings I so much need are so long delayed. \\n\\n Friend, you do not have to understand all God\u0027s ways with you. God does not expect you to understand them. You do not expect your child to understand, only believe. Some day you will see the glory of God in the things which you do not understand.--J. H. McC\\n\\n “If we could push ajar the gates of life,\\n\\n And stand within, and all God\u0027s working see,\\n\\n We might interpret all this doubt and strife,\\n\\n And for each my story could find a key.”\\n\\n “But not today Then be content, poor heart;\\n\\n God\u0027s plans, like lilies pure and white, unfold.\\n\\n We must not tear the close-shut leaves apart-\\n\\n Time will reveal the calyxes of gold.”\\n\\n “And if through patient toil, we reach the land\\n\\n Where tired feet, with sandals loosed, may rest,\\n\\n When we shall clearly know and understand,\\n\\n I think that we shall say, \u0027God knew best.”\\n\\n 九月二十日\\n\\n 「我不是对你说过，你若信，就必看见神的荣耀么。」（约十一40）\\n\\n 马大和马利亚不明白她们的主所做的是甚么。她们两人都先后对祂说：「主阿!祢若早在这里，我兄弟必不死。」（约十一21，23）她们似乎在想：「主阿!我们不明白祢为甚么来得这般迟。我们不明白祢怎么忍心让死亡临到祢所爱的。我们不明白祢怎么忍心让忧伤和苦难来蹂躏我们的生命。为甚么祢不早些来呢？现在是太迟了，因为他死了已经四天了！」\\n\\n 对于这一切疑问，耶稣只用一个伟大的眞理来答复她们：「你也许不明白；但是我告诉你….你若信，就必看见。」 \\n\\n 亚伯拉罕不明白为甚么神要他把他独生的儿子献为燔祭；但是他信，他就看见了神的荣耀。摩西不明白为甚么神要他在旷野隐居四十年，但是他信。当神呼召他去将以色列人从为奴之地领出来的时候，他就看见了。\\n\\n 约瑟对于他哥哥们的残忍，对于一个泼妇的假见证，对于多年不公正的监禁，都丝毫不能明白；但是他信，最后他看见了神在其中的一切荣耀。 \\n\\n 雅各布不明白为什么神应许把约瑟从他怀中扯去，但是当他看见约瑟做了王的宰相，保存了他自己和一国的性命的时候，他就看见了神的荣耀。\\n\\n 亲爱的，在你身上，也是这样。你说：「我不明白为甚么神容让我心所爱的被夺去。我不明白为甚么神应许苦难来侵袭我。我不明白为甚么神领我行走这样曲折的道路。我不明白为甚么我视为美好的计划和目的要受到挫折。我不明白为甚么我这样急迫的需要，迁延了这么久，还没有来到。」\\n\\n 朋友，你用不着明白神对付你的方法。神不盼望你能明白。你并不盼望你的孩子能明白你所做的，是吗？只要信，有一天你必在你所不明白的事上看见神的荣耀。－－马克康该\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5411.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
