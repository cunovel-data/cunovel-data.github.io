There is no reason why we should not ask for large things; and without doubt we shall get large things if we ask in faith, and have the courage to wait with patient perservance upon Him, meantime doing those things which lie within our power to do.\\n\\n We cannot create the wind or set it in motion, but we can set our sails to catch it when it comes; we cannot make the electricity, but we can stretch the wire along upon which it is to run and do its work; we cannot, in a word, control the Spirit, but we can so place ourselves before the Lord, and so do the things He has bidden us do, that we will come under the influence and power of His mighty breath. --Selected.\\n\\n \"Cannot the same wonders be done now as of old? Where is the God of Elijah. He is waiting for Elijah to call on Him.\"\\n\\n The greatest saints who ever lived, whether under the Old or New Dispensation, are on a level which is quite within our reach. The same forces of the spiritual world which were at their command, and the exertion of which made them such spiritual heroes, are open to us also. If we had the same faith, the same hope, the same love which they exhibited, we would achieve marvels as great as those which they achieved. A word of prayer in our mouths would be as potent to call down the gracious dews and melting fires of God\u0027s Spirit, as it was in Elijah\u0027s mouth to call down literal rain and fire, if we could only speak the word with that full assurance of faith wherewith he said it. --Dr. Goulburn, Dean of Norwich.\\n\\n 　 　 六月五日\\n\\n “求得深”（赛七：11直译）。\\n\\n 哦，我的心哪，求得更深，\\n\\n 神之大作为，远超我所求，\\n\\n 在神宝库中，充满慈爱忱。\\n\\n 速从今日起，惟主可全信，\\n\\n 求主必须诚，欢乐永无尽。\\n\\n 　　我们必须继续祈求和等候神，直到听见了回音。断乎没有理由可以禁止我们祈求重大的事物。如果我们用信心祈求，用耐心等候，我们必能从神那里如愿以偿的求得。\\n\\n 　　我们不能造风，或使风吹动，但在有风的时候，我们可以张起帆篷来利用风；我们亦不能制造电，但我们可以架设电线来引导使之流通。换言之，我们不能控制圣灵，但可以陈情于主前，遵照神旨，我们在他万能之下得到圣灵的大能来充满。\\n\\n 　　古时的神迹，能否重演于今日？以利亚的神在何处？以利亚的神正等待今天的以利亚去呼求他。\\n\\n 　　历世历代的古圣徒，他们所能得到的圣灵的力量，今天我们都能得到。如果我们有他们那样的信心，他们那样的盼望，他们那样的爱心，他们那样的忍耐，我们也必得到他们所得到的神迹。\\n\\n 　　倘使我们秉着以利亚祈祷时的坚定信心，我们也有能力唤下圣灵的火和雨，象以利亚一样。——哥尔本\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5159.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
