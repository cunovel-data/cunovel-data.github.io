The glare of the daylight is too brilliant; our eyes become injured, and unable to discern the delicate shades of color, or appreciate neutral tints━the shadowed chamber of sickness, the shadowed house of mourning, the shadowed life from which the sunlight has gone.\n But fear not! It is the shadow of God\u0027s hand. He is leading thee. There are lessons that can be learned only there.\n The photograph of His face can only be fixed in the dark chamber. But do not suppose that He has cast thee aside. Thou art still in His quiver; He has not flung thee away as a worthless thing.\n He is only keeping thee close till the moment comes when He can send thee most swiftly and surely on some errand in which He will be glorified. Oh, shadowed, solitary ones, remember how closely the quiver is bound to the warrior, within easy reach of the hand, and guarded jealously. ━Christ in Isaiah, Meyer.\n In some spheres the shadow condition is the condition of greatest growth. The beautiful Indian corn never grows more rapidly than in the shadow of a warm summer night. The sun curls the leaves in the sultry noon light, but they quickly unfold, if a cloud slips over the sky. There is a service in the shadow that is not in the shine. The world of stellar beauty is never seen at its best till the shadows of night slip over the sky. There are beauties that bloom in the shade that will not bloom in the sun. There is much greenery in lands of fog and clouds and shadow. The florist has \"evening glories\" now, as well as \"morning glories.\" The \"evening glory\" will not shine in the noon\u0027s splendor, but comes to its best as the shadows of evening deepen.\n If all of life were sunshine,\n Our faces would be fain\n To feel once more upon them\n The cooling plash of rain.\n ━Henry Van Dyk　\n 二月二日\n 　　“祂…将我藏在祂手荫之下；又使我成为磨亮的箭，将我藏在祂箭袋之中“ （赛四十九：2）\n 　　“在祂手荫之下“。我们常有到那里去的需要。日光太炫耀了；我们的目光会受到损伤，使我们不能分辨相仿的颜色。所以神将我们暂时藏在疾病的荫中，忧愁的荫中，穷苦的荫中，在那里和日光隔绝。\n 　　但是不要怕这是神的手荫祂正在引导。你有许多功课只能彀在那边学得的。\n 　　不要想神已经把你丢在一边了。你仍旧在祂箭袋之中；祂并没有把你当作无用之物抛去。\n 　　祂现在把你藏起，保守你直到相当的时候，祂要配你在弓弦上，送你出去，使仇敌受亏损，使神得荣耀。哦！在神手荫之下的信徒阿，战士如何宝贝他的箭，把它藏在贴身的箭袋中，神也如此宝贝你爱护你，藏你在祂的荫庇之下。━梅尔\n 　　许多时候，黑荫倒是生长必需的条件。美丽的玉蜀黍在夏夜的荫下生长得最快。在炎热的日光下，牠的叶子是鬈着的，到了天上起黑云的时候，叶子很快地开放了。也有许多美丽的花，日间藏起它们的美丽来，晚荫降时方纔开放。多云多雾和多荫的地带，草木也葱郁茂盛。花圃里不但有晨间怒放的花朵，也有“夜来香”，“夜来香”在日正当中时并无光彩，到深夜纔散布它的芬芳。\n 假如一生尽是阳光，\n 我们将会盼望，\n 清凉的雨滴，\n 洒到我们脸上。\n ━亨利·范戴卡\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4796.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
