{"id":15125,"no":168,"title":"June 17","content":"\"And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.\" (Ezek. 1:25)\\n\\n What is the letting down of the wings? People so often say, \"How do you get the voice of the Lord?\" Here is the secret. They heard the voice when they stood and let down their wings.\\n\\n We have seen a bird with fluttering wings; though standing still, its wings are fluttering. But here we are told they heard the voice when they stood and had let down their wings.\\n\\n Do we not sometimes kneel or sit before the Lord and yet feel conscious of a fluttering of our spirits? Not a real stillness in His presence.\\n\\n A dear one told me several days ago of a certain thing she prayed about, \"But,\" said she, \"I did not wait until the answer came.\"\\n\\n She did not get still enough to hear Him speak, but went away and followed her own thought in the matter. And the result proved disastrous and she had to retrace her steps.\\n\\n Oh, how much energy is wasted! How much time is lost by not letting down the wings of our spirit and getting very quiet before Him! Oh, the calm, the rest, the peace which come as we wait In His presence until we hear from Him!\\n\\n Then, ah then, we can go like lightning, and turn not as we go but go straight forward whithersoever the Spirit goes. (Ezek. 1:1, 20)\\n\\n \"Be still! Just now be still!\\n\\n Something thy soul hath never heard,\\n\\n Something unknown to any song of bird,\\n\\n Something unknown to any wind, or wave, or star,\\n\\n A message from the Fatherland afar,\\n\\n That with sweet joy the homesick soul shall thrill,\\n\\n Cometh to thee if thou canst but be still.\\n\\n \"Be still! Just now be still!\\n\\n There comes a presence very mild and sweet;\\n\\n White are the sandals of His noiseless feet.\\n\\n It is the Comforter whom Jesus sent\\n\\n To teach thee what the words He uttered meant.\\n\\n The willing, waiting spirit, He doth fill.\\n\\n If thou would\u0027st hear His message,\\n\\n Dear soul, be still!\"\\n\\n 　 六月十七日\\n\\n “当活物站住，将翅膀垂下的时候，在他们头以上的穹苍之上有声音”（结一：25直译）。\\n\\n 　　人常问：“你如何听见神的声音的”？在这里有一个秘诀。当活物站住，垂下翅膀时，在他们上面就有全能者的声音发出来了。什么是“站住”和“垂下”呢？只有一个意思——停止自己的活动。\\n\\n 　　我们看见过扑动翅膀的鸟雀，他虽站着，还是在煽动翅膀。这一节经文告诉我们，我们要站住，垂下翅膀不动，就可以听到天上的声音。\\n\\n 有时我们虽跪在主面前，但我们觉得心思意念仍在扑动，你有这种经验吗？这是在主的面前，并未真正的安定。\\n\\n 　　一位朋友告诉我：前几天她专心为着某件事祷告；她说：“但是我不等到答应来到，就照我自己的意思去做了”。结果非常不幸。\\n\\n 　　哦，因为我们不肯“站住”和“垂下”的缘故，以致吃多少亏！——耗费光阴，损失精力，而事情又必须重新开始。\\n\\n 　　啊，基督徒，让我们“站住”，把“翅膀垂下”，领受神的话，然后我们可以“直往前行，灵往哪里去……就往哪里去，行走并不转身”（结一：12）了。——选\\n\\n 安静，此刻就安静你的心，\\n\\n 你所没有听过的信息即来临，\\n\\n 这不是风浪之声所可比拟,\\n\\n 也绝不类于鸟雀的唱鸣,\\n\\n 它将鼓舞愁思的灵魂,\\n\\n 这是天国传来的福音,\\n\\n 一定会到,只要安静你的心。\\n\\n 安静,此刻就安静你的心,\\n\\n 来的是主所遣的保惠师,\\n\\n 步履轻盈,温和慈爱,\\n\\n 在你面前显出眉目依稀,\\n\\n 他将给虔诚等待的灵魂,\\n\\n 充实以宝训中所含的精微,\\n\\n 心如止水,即可聆受妙机。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5171.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
