Ah, there are secrets of love and wisdom in the \"Delayed Blessings Department,\" which are little dreamt of! Men would pluck their mercies green when the Lord would have them ripe. \"Therefore will the Lord WAIT, that He may be gracious unto you\" (Isa. 30:18). He is watching in the hard places and will not allow one trial too many; He will let the dross be consumed, and then He will come gloriously to your help.\\n\\n Do not grieve Him by doubting His love. Nay, lift up your head, and begin to praise Him even now for the deliverance which is on the way to you, and you will be abundantly rewarded for the delay which has tried your faith.\\n\\n O Thou of little faith,\\n\\n God hath not failed thee yet!\\n\\n When all looks dark and gloomy,\\n\\n Thou dost so soon forget━\\n\\n Forget that He has led thee,\\n\\n And gently cleared thy way;\\n\\n On clouds has poured His sunshine,\\n\\n And turned thy night to day.\\n\\n And if He\u0027s helped thee hitherto,\\n\\n He will not fail thee now;\\n\\n How it must wound His loving heart\\n\\n To see thy anxious brow!\\n\\n Oh! doubt not any longer,\\n\\n To Him commit thy way,\\n\\n Whom in the past thou trusted,\\n\\n And is \"just the same today.\"\\n\\n ━Selected\\n\\n 七月四日\\n\\n “因为这默示有一定的日期，…虽然迟延，还要等待。因为必然临到，不再迟延” （哈二：3）\\n\\n 有一本美丽的小书，名叫《期望所》，里面讲到斯罗门在异象中进入神的储藏室，在那里他看见了许多奇异的东西。在许多奇异的东西中间，有一间“延福室”，里面藏着人们向神求告的一切东西；神将那些东西留在储藏室内，等候相当的时日赐给人们。\\n\\n 许多人不明白，“迟延”不是“拒绝”。他们不能领会“迟延”是神的慈爱和智慧！以赛亚三十章十八节说：“耶和华必然等候，要赐恩给你们”。你所遭遇的患难，祂都知道；祂必定不是叫过于你能忍受的试炼临到你；祂必须等到你里面的废物都烧尽了，纔来救助你。\\n\\n 读者，你不要怀疑神的慈爱来伤神的慈心。你应当为着正在途中的拯救抬起头来赞美祂；这样，你一定会得到更丰富的报偿。\\n\\n 信心微小的信徒啊，\\n\\n 神何尝把你遗弃？\\n\\n 在一切似若黑暗无望之时，\\n\\n 你竟这么快就把真理忘记。\\n\\n 忘记了祂曾带你前行，\\n\\n 温和地为你把路开平，\\n\\n 祂的太阳曾照透密云，\\n\\n 把你的黑暗变成光明。\\n\\n 祂旣一直给你帮助，\\n\\n 如今决不会把你辜负，\\n\\n 这将如何伤祂慈爱的心，\\n\\n 假若看到你如此烦恼。\\n\\n 把你的前途交托给神，\\n\\n 不要再存怀疑之心，\\n\\n 你过去虔诚信靠的祂，\\n\\n 从不改变，自古至今。\\n\\n ━选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5255.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
