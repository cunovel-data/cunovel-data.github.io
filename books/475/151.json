Some planks and veneers made from an oak beam which had been part of a ship eighty years old were exhibited a few years ago at a fashionable furniture store on Broadway, New York, and attracted general notice for the exquisite coloring and beautiful grain. Equally striking were some beams of mahogany taken from a bark which sailed the seas sixty years ago. The years and the traffic had contracted the pores and deepened the color, until it looked as superb in its chromatic intensity as an antique Chinese vase. It was made into a cabinet, and has today a place of honor in the drawing-room of a wealthy New York family. So there is a vast difference between the quality of old people who have lived flabby, self-indulgent, useless lives, and the fiber of those who have sailed all seas and carried all cargoes as the servants of God and the helpers of their fellow men. Not only the wrenching and straining of life, but also something of the sweetness of the cargoes carried get into the very pores and fiber of character. --Louis Albert Banks. When the sun goes below the horizon he is not set; the heavens glow for a full hour after his departure. And when a great and good man sets, the sky of this world is luminous long after he is out of sight. Such a man cannot die out of this world. When he goes he leaves behind him much of himself. Being dead, he speaks. –Beecher. When Victor Hugo was past eighty years of age he gave expression to his religious faith in these sublime sentences: \"I feel in myself the future life. I am like a forest which has been more than once cut down. The new shoots are livelier than ever. I am rising toward the sky. The sunshine is on my head. The earth gives me its generous sap, but Heaven lights me with its unknown worlds. \"You say the soul is nothing but the resultant of the bodily powers. Why, then, is my soul more luminous when my bodily powers begin to fail? Winter is on my head, but eternal spring is in my heart. I breathe at this hour the fragrance of the lilacs, the violets, and the roses as at twenty years. The nearer I approach the end the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. It is marvelous, yet simple.\" 　 　 五月三十一日 “好象禾捆到时收藏”（伯五：25）。 　　有一个人提出了关于拆卸古老海船的报告，他说旧船木料质地之所以佳良，不仅因为年代久远，而且还因为船只曾在海上历受了种种的磨炼，以及它所接触的海水，所载的各种货品，使它发生了化学作用。 　　在纽约百老汇街一家时式家具店，展出了一些橡木板料，这些板料取材于一艘具有八十年历史的旧船的横梁，其色泽之美，纹理之精致，吸引了许多市民的注意参观。 　　还有一艘在六十年前航行海上的帆船，它那桃花心木的横梁，也非常出色。悠长的岁月和航行的历史，使木料气孔紧缩，颜色变深，它坚韧的质地，古趣盎然的色泽，可与中国古瓶比美。这木料如今在纽约一位富豪的客厅里制成了一个小小的暖阁，成为客厅中的尊贵之地。 　　由此看来，那些不经磨炼，悠悠忽忽，虚度一生的人们，和那些曾经沧海，载负过各种货物，事奉神而帮助人的基督徒，在性质上具有极大的差别。后者不仅有磨练的经验，他们所载运的货物中的甜蜜气质，也渗入了他们的待人接物的美德中。 　　太阳虽下了地平线，其实并未消逝，它离去以后，天上仍有整整一个小时的光亮。一位伟人和义人去世之后，他的踪迹虽逝，但他的音容宛在此世，他虽死了，他身后留下的一切对世有贡献的事物，虽死犹生。——皮邱 　　法国文豪雨果过了八十岁以后，他以下面的一段名言来表达他的心意说：“我感觉到未来的新生命。我象一度曾经数度砍伐的森林，而新的萌芽充满了前所未有的活泼生机。我升向天空，阳光照在我的头上。大地给我丰富的活力，天的光明四照，使我看清了神秘的宇宙万象”。 　　“你说灵魂不过是肉体力量的延长。那么为什么我的体力已开始衰退，而我的灵魂变得更为光明？冬季已临到我的头上，永恒的春季却在我的心头。此刻我呼吸着紫丁香，紫罗兰，和玫瑰花，就象在二十岁的时候一样，我愈接近人生的终点，愈能听清楚四周欢迎我的交响乐，欢迎我前往那不朽的世界。这虽属神奇，但道理却十分单纯”。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5140.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
