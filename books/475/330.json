Who answered, give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs\" (Joshua 15:18-19) \n There are both upper and nether springs. They are springs, not stagnant pools. There are joys and blessings that flow from above through the hottest summer and the most desert land of sorrow and trial. The lands of Achsah were \"south lands,\" lying under a burning sun and often parched with burning heat. But from the hills came the unfailing springs, that cooled, refreshed and fertilized all the land.\n There are springs that flow in the low places of life, in the hard places, in the desert places, in the lone places, in the common places, and no matter what may be our situation, we can always find these upper springs.\n Abraham found them amid the hills of Canaan. Moses found them among the rocks of Midian. David found them among the ashes of Ziklag when his property was gone, his family captives and his people talked of stoning him, but \"David encouraged himself in the Lord.\"(1 Sam.30:6)\n Habakkuk found them when the fig tree was withered and the fields were brown, but as he drank from them he could sing: \"Yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation.\"(Hab.3:18)\n Isaiah found them in the awful days of Sennacherib\u0027s invasion, when the mountains seemed hurled into the midst of the sea, but faith could sing: \"There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God. God is in the midst of her: she shall not be moved.\"(Ps.46:4-5)\n The martyrs found them amid the flames, and reformers amid their foes and conflicts, and we can find them all the year if we have the Comforter in our hearts and have learned to say with David: \"All my springs are in thee.\"(Ps.87:7)\n How many and how precious these springs, and how much more there is to be possessed of God\u0027s own fulness! ━A. B. Simpson\n I said: \"The desert is so wide!\"\n I said: \"The desert is so bare!\n What springs to quench my thirst are there?\n Whence shall I from the tempest hide?\"\n I said: \"The desert is so lone!\n Nor gentle voice, nor loving face\n Will brighten any smallest space. \"\n I paused or ere my moan was done!\n I heard a flow of hidden springs;\n Before me palms rose green and fair;\n The birds were singing; all the air\n Did shine and stir with angels\u0027 wings!\n And One said mildly: \"Why, indeed,\n Take over-anxious thought for that\n The morrow bringeth! See you not\n The Father knoweth what you need?\"\n ━Selected \n 十一月二十六日 \n 「迦勒问他说，你要甚么。他说，求你赐福给我，你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。他父亲就把上泉下泉赐给他。」 （书十五:18-19）\n 押撒的地是「南地」━一块在烈日之下非常炎热的地。他父亲给了他水泉，从此山上有不竭的泉水流下来使全地凉爽、肥沃了。\n 我们所在环境，无论如何炎热、荒芜、艰难、痛苦、寂寞、平庸，我们总能找到喜乐和祝福的。因为我们的父亲已把活水的泉源赐给我们了。\n 亚伯拉罕曾在迦南的山中,摩西在米甸的岩石里,都曾发现过这种泉水。戴维在洗格拉的灰烬中，虽然他妻子儿女都被掳去，众人说要用石头打死他，「戴维却倚靠耶和华」（撒上卅:6）\n 哈巴谷虽然看见无花果树不发旺、田地不出粮食…他仍能唱说：「然而我要因耶和华欢欣，因救我的神喜乐。」（哈三:18） \n 以赛亚在西拿基立上来攻击犹大的时候，虽然似乎都摇动到海心了，他仍能用信心唱说：「有一道河。这河的分汊，使神的城欢喜…神在其中。城必不动摇。」（诗四十六:4-5）\n 许多殉道者在火焰中仍有喜乐；许多信徒在患难中仍有平安；这是为甚么缘故呢？乃是因为他们能和戴维一同唱说：「我的泉源都在祢里面。」（诗八十七:7）\n 啊！我们的父亲所赐给我们的水泉多么宝贵！━宣信 \n 我说：「这沙漠多么广大！」 \n 我说：「这沙漠多么荒凉！ \n 那里有泉水给我解渴？ \n 何处?可给我躲避风沙猖狂！」\n 我说：「这沙漠多么寂寥！ \n 没有柔声细语，没有可爱脸孔 \n 给最小地方带来盼望。」 \n 我停下来，抱怨声仍在！ \n 忽然,听见潜藏地下的泉声；\n 面前升起葱绿的棕榈； \n 鸟儿在歌唱；整个空中 \n 都闪耀着天使的翅羽！ \n 有一位在温柔地说： \n 「何必为明天忧虑悲惨， \n 你难道还不明白， \n 天父知道你需要的东西吗？」 \n ━选\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5565.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
