Desiring to divert my mind from my hopeless condition, I fixed my eyes on an ant that was carrying a grain of corn larger than itself up a high wall. I numbered the efforts it made to accomplish this object. The grain fell sixty-nine times to the ground; but the insect persevered, and the seventieth time it reached the top. This sight gave me courage at the moment, and I never forgot the lesson. ━The King\u0027s Business. \n \n \n \n Prayer which takes the fact that past prayers have not been answered as a reason for languor, has already ceased to be the prayer of faith. To the prayer of faith the fact that prayers remain unanswered is only evidence that the moment of the answer is so much nearer. From first to last, the lessons and examples of our Lord all tell us that prayer which cannot persevere and urge its plea importunately, and renew, and renew itself again, and gather strength from every past petition, is not the prayer that will prevail. ━William Arthur. \n \n \n \n Rubenstein, the great musician, once said, \"If I omit practice one day, I notice it; if two days, my friends notice it; if three days, the public notice it.\" It is the old doctrine, \"Practice makes perfect.\" We must continue believing, continue praying, continue doing His will. Suppose along any line of art, one should cease practicing, we know what the result would be. If we would only use the same quality of common sense in our religion that we use in our everyday life, we should go on to perfection. \n \n \n \n The motto of David Livingstone was in these words, \"I determined never to stop until I had come to the end and achieved my purpose.\" By unfaltering persistence and faith in God he conquered. \n \n 　 \n \n 　 \n \n 一月十九日 \n \n \n \n “常常祷告，不可灰心” （路十八：1） \n \n \n \n 　　泰墨兰常喜欢向他的朋友述说他早年的轶事。他说：“我有一次被仇敌追逼，不得已藏匿在一所破屋中，我在那里独自枯坐了几个钟头。那时万念俱灰，再也没有志气和勇敢去干前面的事业了。在绝望中我看见一只小小的蚂蚁，背着一粒比牠大数倍的谷，尽力向墙上拖走。牠跌下来多次，但是每一次牠仍旧努力向上。我曾数过牠跌下来了六十九次，可是牠并不灰心气馁，第七十次牠到达了高墙的顶上。那时我得了兴奋，我终身不能遗忘这个教训。━译自《君王的轶事》 \n \n \n \n 　　我们如果看以前许多祷告都得不着答应，因此就有点灰心，我告述你那就不是信心的祷告了。信心的祷告看以前没有得到答应的祷告是一种鼓励，一种证据，暗示我们神的答应的来到是更近了，就在前面了。从起初到末了，主的教训和榜样都告诉我们：应当常常祷告，不可灰心；恳求的祷告若是没有得到答应，就该集中以前所有的力量，继续求神，直等到神给你应许，或是成就。如果神已经听了你的祷告，这并不是说，祷告可以中止了，仍该继续，只是恳求的祷告应当改为赞美和感谢的祷告。━亚塞 \n \n \n \n 　　大音乐家鲁班斯坦有一次说：“如果我一天不练习音乐，我自己会觉得；如果两天不练习，我的朋友会觉得；如果三天不练习，人人都会觉得。”我们的祷告也是如此，若不常常祷告，你和别人都会发觉：你的祷告是走了样的。 \n \n \n \n 　　莫勒先生曾为他五个不信的朋友祷告。他天天求神不肯放松，虽然一时看不见甚么效果，可是他绝不灰心，一直继续求神。结果：五年之后，第一个朋友得救了；十年之后，第二得救了。他在祷告上所花的工夫，并不是徒然的。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4840.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
