{"id":15002,"no":45,"title":"February 14","content":"\"And again I say, Rejoice.\" (Phil. 4:4) It is a good thing to rejoice in the Lord. Perhaps you have tried this, and the first time seemed to fail. Never mind, keep right on and when you cannot feel any joy, when there is no spring, and no seeming comfort and encouragement, still rejoice, and count it all joy. Even when you fall into divers temptations, reckon it joy and delight and God will make your reckoning good. Do you suppose your Father will let you carry the banner of His victory and His gladness on to the front of the battle, and then coolly stand back and see you captured or beaten back by the enemy? NEVER! The Holy Spirit will sustain you in your bold advance, and fill your heart with gladness and praise, and you will find your heart all exhilarated and refreshed by the fullness within. Lord teach me to rejoice in Thee, and to \"rejoice evermore.\" (1 Thess.5:16)━Selected \"The weakest saint may Satan rout, Who meets him with a praiseful shout.\" \"…Be filled with the Spirit,...singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.\" (Eph. 5:18, 19) Here the Apostle urges the use of singing as one of the inspiring helps in the spiritual life. He counsels his readers not to seek their stimulus through the body, but through the spirit; not by the quickening of the flesh, but by the exaltation of the soul \"Sometimes a light surprises The Christian while he sings.\" Let us sing even when we do not feel like it, for thus we may give wings to leaden feet and turn weariness into strength. ━J. H. Jowett \"At midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.\" (Acts 16:25) Oh, Paul, thou wondrous example to the flock, who could thus glory, bearing in the body as thou didst \"…the marks of the Lord Jesus\"!(Gal.6:17) Marks from stoning almost to the death, from thrice beating with rods, from those hundred and ninety-five stripes laid on thee by the Jews, and from stripes received in that Philippian jail, which had they not drawn blood would not have called for washing! Surely the grace which enabled thee to sing praises under such suffering is all-sufficient grace. ━J. Roach \"Oh, let us rejoice in the Lord, evermore, When darts of the tempter are flying, For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore, Our singing much more than our sighing.\" 二月十四日 “我再说你们要喜乐”（腓四：4） 　　在主里喜乐，何其佳美！也许你曾试过要凡事喜乐，可是不久卽告失败。不要紧，仍继续下去，当你不能感觉喜乐，没有可以喜乐的理由，安慰和鼓励时，仍该喜乐，算作喜乐。甚至当你落在百般试炼中的时侯，仍要算作喜乐；这样，神就要证明你的“算”不是徒然的。你想你的父亲会不会让你举着得胜和喜乐的旗号到前线去，然后祂冷冷地向后一退，任凭你被仇敌掳去或击败呢？决不！父的圣灵必定会在你勇敢地前进的时侯支持你，将喜乐和赞美充满你的心，那时侯你就会因着里面的充满感到非常的新鲜和欢乐了。主啊，教导我们怎样在你里面喜乐，“要常常喜乐”（帖前五：16）━选 “向撒但高唱对主的赞美， 最弱的圣徒，也能击败魔鬼。” 　　“…要被圣灵充满…口唱心和赞美主”（弗五：18-19） 　　这里使徒保罗劝我们用歌唱赞美来增进我们的灵命。他劝告读者，要从圣灵里寻求激动，而不是外表的兴奋，不是求肉体的刺激，乃是求灵里的欢欣。 “圣徒以歌讼赞美神， 时常会见到光明的骤临。” 　　让我们不断地歌唱赞美，甚至不喜欢唱的时侯也得唱。这或许可以使你沉滞的腿上有似添了活泼的翅翼，转变疲乏成为力量。━乔怀得 　　“约在半夜，保罗和西拉，祷告﹑唱诗﹑赞美神；众囚犯也侧耳而听”（徒十六：25） 哦！使徒保罗，你真是众圣徒的表率，你能够这样荣耀神，你“…身上带着耶稣的印记。”（加六：17）你有被石掷伤的记号三次棍打的伤疤，犹太人给你的一百九十五鞭的鞭痕，腓立比监狱中无数的血斑！你靠着恩典还能在受苦的牢狱中唱出赞美来。啊，我相信那恩典一定是彀用的恩典！━罗区 魔鬼的飞箭如雨而来， 我们永远在主里欢喜， 从古到今，撒但总有它的戒心， 我们的歌唱，远胜我们的哀叹。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4860.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
