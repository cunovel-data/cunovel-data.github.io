{"id":15321,"no":364,"title":"December 30","content":"“Peter was kept in prison: but prayer (instant and earnest prayer) was made for him.”(Acts 12:5,margin) Peter was in prison awaiting his execution. The Church had neither human power nor influence to save him. There was no earthly help, but there was help to be obtained by the way of Heaven. They gave themselves to fervent, importunate prayer. God sent His angel, who aroused Peter from sleep and led him out through the first and second wards of the prison; and when they came to the iron gate, it opened to them of its own accord, and Peter was free. There may be some iron gate in your life that has blocked your way. Like a caged bird you have often beaten against the bars, but instead of helping, you have only had to fall back tired, exhausted and sore at heart. There is a secret for you to learn, and that is believing prayer; and when you come to the iron gate, it will open of its own accord. How much wasted energy and sore disappointment will be saved if you will learn to pray as did the Church in the upper room! Insurmountable difficulties will disappear; adverse circumstances will prove favorable if you learn to pray, not with your own faith but with the faith of God (Mark 11:22, margin). Souls in prison have been waiting for years for the gate to open; love ones out of Christ, bound by Satan, will be set free when you pray till you definitely believe God. ━C. H. P. Emergencies call for intense prayer. When the man becomes the prayer nothing can resist its touch. Elijah on Carmel, bowed down on the ground, with his face between his knees, that was prayer━the man himself. No words are mentioned. Prayer can be too tense for words. The man\u0027s whole being was in touch with God, and was set with God against the powers of evil. They couldn\u0027t withstand such praying. There\u0027s more of this embodied praying needed. ━The Bent-knee Time “Groanings which cannot be uttered are often prayers which cannot be refused.” ━C. H. Spurgeon 十二月三十日 “彼得被囚在监。教会却为他切切的祷告神（徒十二:5） 彼得在监里等候处决。教会既没有能力拯救他，又没有势力拯救他。地上的帮助得不到了，可是天上的帮助还得得到。他们切切的祷告神。神遂差遣他的使者，夜间去拍醒彼得，领他过了第一层、第二层监牢，来到临街铁门。那门自己开了，彼得就得了自由。 　亲爱的，在你的道路上，也许也有铁门阻塞你的前进。像一只笼中的鸟一般，你一直击打门闩；可是非但得不到帮助，反使你非常疲惫，非常疼痛。你如果学会了秘诀，就不会这样了。甚么秘诀呢？就是相信祷告；(可11:22) 这样，当你来到铁门旁边，那门就会自己开了。如果你能想象当初的教会在楼房里那样恳切祷告，你就会节省许多精力，免除许多烦恼，困难也能胜过了；逆境也能顺利了；被撒但所捆绑的亲友也能得到释放了。 ━C.H.P. 　　危急的时候，是祷告最恳切的时候。伊莱贾在迦密山顶屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中。虽然没有出声的话语，他的全人已经与神合一━与神同心合意地反对恶者的势力。这是我们祷告时所当有的态度。━译自屈膝的时候 　　说不出来的叹息常是不能拒绝的祷告。━司布真","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5599.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
