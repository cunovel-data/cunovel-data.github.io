He could say of Abraham, \"I know him, that he will command his children . . . that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken.\" God can be depended upon; He wants us to be just as decided, as reliable, as stable. This is just what faith means.\\n\\n God is looking for men on whom He can put the weight of all His love and power and faithful promises. God\u0027s engines are strong enough to draw any weight we attach to them. Unfortunately the cable which we fasten to the engine is often too weak to hold the weight of our prayer; therefore God is drilling us, disciplining us to stability and certainty in the life of faith. Let us learn our lessons and stand fast.━A.B. Simpson\\n\\n God knows that you can stand that trial; He would not give it to you if you could not. It is His trust in you that explains the trials of life, however bitter they may be. God knows our strength, and He measures it to the last inch; and a trial was never given to any man that was greater than that man\u0027s strength, through God, to bear it.━ Selected \\n\\n 十一月十三日\\n\\n 「我知道他，他将吩咐他的众子……使我所应许亚伯拉罕的话都成就了。」 （创十八:19，直译）\\n\\n 神需要一班能被祂信托的人。神对于亚伯拉罕，神能说：「我知道他，他将吩咐他的众子……使我所应许亚伯拉罕的话都成就了。」神是可靠的，神要我们也像祂一样可靠。\\n\\n 神在寻找一班人━一班受得住祂一切爱、能力、应许的人。神的机器原拖得动我们一切的重担的，可惜我们用以缚住机器的那根锚索太细弱了；所以神必须训练我们的信心。━信宣\\n\\n 神知道你能忍受多少；祂必不会将你所不能忍受的试炼加给你的。祂叫你经过试炼，是表明祂信任你。━选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5552.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
