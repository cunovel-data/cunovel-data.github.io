{"id":15066,"no":109,"title":"April 19","content":"\"Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.\" (Exod. 14:13)\n These words contain God\u0027s command to the believer when he is reduced to great straits and brought into extraordinary difficulties. He cannot retreat; he cannot go forward; he is shut upon the right hand and on the left. What is he now to do?\n The Master\u0027s word to him is \"stand still.\" It will be well for him if, at such times, he listens only to his Master\u0027s word, for other and evil advisers come with their suggestions. Despair whispers, \"Lie down and die; give it all up.\" But God would have us put on a cheerful courage, and even in our worst times, rejoice in His love and faithfulness.\n Cowardice says, \"Retreat; go back to the worldling\u0027s way of action; you cannot play the Christian\u0027s part; it is too difficult. Relinquish your principles.\"\n But, however much Satan may urge this course upon you, you cannot follow it, if you are a child of God. His Divine fiat has bid thee go from strength to strength, and so thou shalt, and neither death nor hell shall turn thee from thy course. What if for a while thou art called to stand still; yet this is but to renew thy strength for some greater advance in due time.\n Precipitancy cries, \"Do something; stir yourself; to stand still and wait is sheer idleness.\" We must be doing something at once--we must do it, so we think--instead of looking to the Lord, who will not only do something, but will do everything.\n Presumption boasts, \"If the sea be before you, march into it, and expect a miracle.\" But faith listens neither to Presumption, nor to Despair, nor to Cowardice, nor to Precipitancy, but it hears God say, \"Stand still,\" and immovable as a rock it stands.\n \"Stand still\"--keep the posture of an upright man, ready for action, expecting further orders, cheerfully and patiently awaiting the directing voice; and it will not be long ere God shall say to you, as distinctly as Moses said it to the people of Israel, \"Go forward. \" --Spurgeon.\n \"Be quiet! why this anxious heed\n About thy tangled ways?\n God knows them all. He giveth speed\n And He allows delays.\n \u0027Tis good for thee to walk by faith\n And not by sight.\n Take it on trust a little while.\n Soon shalt thou read the mystery aright\n In the full sunshine of His smile.\"\n In times of uncertainty, wait. Always, if you have any doubt, wait. Do not force yourself to any action. If you have a restraint in your spirit, wait until all is clear, and do not go against it.\n 　 四月十九日\n “只管站住，看耶和华今天向你们所要施行的救恩”（出十四：13）。\n 　　这节经文对那些遭遇大患难，沦入四面楚歌的圣徒们，正当他左右为难，进退维谷，不知怎样办的时候，就是神给他一个明确的指示。\n 　　神所给的指示是“只管站住”。在这种情形之下，只有听神的话才能得救，否则魔鬼及其他的建议，将纷至沓来。“绝望”小声对你说：“放弃一切，躺下来等死吧！”但神要我们鼓起勇气，满了乐观与希望，即使在最患难的时候，也要因他的仁慈和信实而欢欣。\n 　　“懦弱”对你说：“向后退却，退回到你原来的世俗办法中去，你不配做基督徒，这正是太难做了，放弃你的信仰吧！”\n 　　假若你真是神的子民，无论魔鬼如何催促你采取世俗的途径，你决不会信从。神命令你努力再努力向前进，你就该遵行，前途无论是死亡或地狱，都不能更变你前进的方向。神吩咐你站立一会儿，只是要你添增新的力量，以备在适当的时候奔向更远的前程。\n 　　“急躁”也向你诱惑，它说：“行动要积极，方称有所作为，站住等待全是无聊与浪费”。我们在肉身头脑的领悟中很能受它的话影响，心中就想必须立刻有所作为，我们必须下手行动，于是不再去仰望神了。殊不知他要你站住，不但有所作为，而且还作一切胜利临到的准备。\n 　　“傲慢”对你夸口说：“假若海洋挡在你面前，冲过去，要求奇迹的出现！”但是信心对于傲慢，绝望，懦弱，和急躁等等的话，一概不听，只听神的吩咐，“只管站住”屹立不动，有如磐石。\n 　　“只管站住”，以昂然直立的姿态，准备行动，期待以后的吩咐，愉快而谨慎地等候神的指引。不久神就会对你说，象摩西对以色列人民那样清晰地说：“往前走”。——司布真\n 你要宁静！不必为了路径的纷绕，\n 心中就如此不安与焦躁，\n 神催促你加速，也让你绥慢。\n 他一切都成竹在胸，清楚知道，\n 走路要凭信心，不是单凭感觉，\n 愿你对此指示完全信靠，\n 不久你会在他笑容的光照下，\n 了解这神秘的真理和奥妙。\n 　　在没有把握的时候，你要等待。心中任何疑惑的时候，也要等待。不要勉强作任何行动。假若你的心灵如受约束，就该等待到一切澄清，不要故意违抗。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5045.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
