A discouraged soul is helpless. He can neither resist the wiles of the enemy himself, while in this state, nor can he prevail in prayer for others.\\n\\n Flee from every symptom of this deadly foe as you would flee from a viper. And be not slow in turning your back on it, unless you want to bite the dust in bitter defeat.\\n\\n Search out God\u0027s promises and say aloud of each one: \"This promise is mine.\" If you still experience a feeling of doubt and discouragement, pour out your heart to God and ask Him to rebuke the adversary who is so mercilessly nagging you.\\n\\n The very instant you whole-heartedly turn away from every symptom of distrust and discouragement, the blessed Holy Spirit will quicken your faith and inbreathe Divine strength into your soul.\\n\\n At first you may not be conscious of this, still as you resolutely and uncompromisingly \"snub\" every tendency toward doubt and depression that assails you, you will soon be made aware that the powers of darkness are falling back.\\n\\n Oh, if our eyes could only behold the solid phalanx of strength, of power, that is ever behind every turning away from the hosts of darkness, God-ward, what scant heed would be given to the effort of the wily foe to distress, depress, discourage us!\\n\\n All the marvelous attributes of the Godhead are on the side of the weakest believer, who in the name of Christ, and in simple, childlike trust, yields himself to God and turns to Him for help and guidance. --Selected.\\n\\n On a day in the autumn, I saw a prairie eagle mortally wounded by a rifle shot. His eye still gleamed like a circle of light. Then he slowly turned his head, and gave one more searching and longing look at the sky. He had often swept those starry spaces with his wonderful wings. The beautiful sky was the home of his heart. It was the eagle\u0027s domain. A thousand times he had exploited there his splendid strength. In those far away heights he had played with the lightnings, and raced with the winds, and now, so far away from home, the eagle lay dying, done to the death, because for once be forgot and flew too low. The soul is that eagle. This is not its home. It must not lose the skyward look. We must keep faith, we must keep hope, we must keep courage, we must keep Christ. We would better creep away from the battlefield at once if we are not going to be brave. There is no time for the soul to stampede. Keep the skyward look, my soul; keep the skyward look!\\n\\n \"Keep looking up—\\n\\n The waves that roar around thy feet,\\n\\n Jehovah-Jireh will defeat\\n\\n When looking up.\\n\\n \"Keep looking up—\\n\\n Though darkness seems to wrap thy soul;\\n\\n The Light of Light shall fill thy soul \\n\\n When looking up.\\n\\n \"Keep looking up—\\n\\n When worn, distracted with the fight;\\n\\n Your Captain gives you conquering might\\n\\n When you look up.\"\\n\\n We can never see the sun rise by looking into the west. --Japanese Proverb.\\n\\n 　 四月二日\\n\\n “他们…观看，不料，耶和华的荣光在云中显现”（出十六：10）。\\n\\n 　　黑云当空时，当养成一个习惯：一直看它银色的夹里，不去看它黑色的面子。\\n\\n 　　事情无论怎样糟，不可落到失望的地步。人失望简直等于无望。因为一个失望的人，既不能抵抗仇敌的攻击，又不能为人发出有效的代祷。\\n\\n 　　当逃避这样可怕的仇敌——失望，——犹如逃避一条致命的毒蛇一般。不要在它面前慢慢地转身，除非你愿意一败涂地。\\n\\n 　　在神前搜寻他的应许。既得着了，就用指头指着它说：“神，你曾说过这个。这应许是给我的”。若是你仍感觉怀疑或失望，向神倾心吐意地求他为你斥责欺侮你的仇敌。\\n\\n 　　一等到你全心离开不信和失望，圣灵立刻要复活你的信心，将属天的能力吹入你里面去。\\n\\n 　　起先你也许不觉得有什么动静，可是你只要决心抵抗每一个偏于疑惑和失望的倾向，你就会看见黑暗的势力败退。\\n\\n 　　哦，巴不得我们的眼睛能看见在黑暗势力后面的神的权能，我们就不会惧怕仇敌的狡猾，恶魔欲使我们落入悲伤，抑郁，灰心，气馁等的各种欺骗，将不值得一顾了。\\n\\n 神所具有伟大的权力，都是为了维护我们脆弱的心灵，只要奉基督的名，与纯洁无邪的信心，依靠神，向神祈求和引导。\\n\\n 　　一天，我看见草场上躺着一只重伤的老鹰。它的眼睛仍在射出光来。它慢慢地转过它的头来，再望一望它所渴幕的天空。它以前常在那里疾驰高飞。这美丽的天空是它心目中的老家。它曾千万次在那里表演它的勇力。它曾在高处与闪电同玩，与疾风竞走；现在呢，离家这么远，只因一次不小心飞得太低，就在这里等死。啊，让我们拿老鹰来比我们的心：世界并不是我们的老家。虽然我们在世上受了创伤，但是我们的心还得向着天家。我们应该守住信心，守住盼望，守住勇气，守住基督。如果我们没有勇气，我们还是早些离开战场的好。我的魂哪，你当仰望天！——选\\n\\n 继续向天盼望，\\n\\n 围着你怒号的浪涛，\\n\\n 就会被耶和华一扫而光！\\n\\n 当你向天盼望。\\n\\n 继续向天盼望，\\n\\n 虽然灵魂如被笼罩黑乡，\\n\\n 但终于充满了永恒之光，\\n\\n 当你向天盼望。\\n\\n 继续向天盼望，\\n\\n 虽然到了疲惫志丧，\\n\\n 主会给你得胜的力量，\\n\\n 当你向天盼望。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5028.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
