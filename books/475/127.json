We begin to pray for a certain thing; we put up our petitions for a day, a week, a month; and then, receiving as yet no definite answer, straightway we faint, and cease altogether from prayer concerning it.\\n\\n This is a deadly fault. It is simply the snare of many beginnings with no completions. It is ruinous in all spheres of life.\\n\\n The man who forms the habit of beginning without finishing has simply formed the habit of failure. The man who begins to pray about a thing and does not pray it through to a successful issue of answer has formed the same habit in prayer.\\n\\n To faint is to fail; then defeat begets disheartenment, and unfaith in the reality of prayer, which is fatal to all success.\\n\\n But someone says, \"How long shall we pray? Do we not come to a place where we may cease from our petitions and rest the matter in God\u0027s hands?\"\\n\\n There is but one answer. Pray until the thing you pray for has actually been granted, or until you have the assurance in your heart that it will be.\\n\\n Only at one of these two places dare we stay our importunity, for prayer is not only a calling upon God, but also a conflict with Satan. And inasmuch as God is using our intercession as a mighty factor of victory in that conflict, He alone, and not we, must decide when we dare cease from our petitioning. So we dare not stay our prayer until the answer itself has come, or until we receive the assurance that it will come.\\n\\n In the first case we stop because we see. In the other, we stop because we believe, and the faith of our heart is just as sure as the sight of our eyes; for it is faith from, yes, the faith of God, within us.\\n\\n More and more, as we live the prayer life, shall we come to experience and recognize this God-given assurance, and know when to rest quietly in it, or when to continue our petitioning until we receive it. --The Practice of Prayer.\\n\\n Tarry at the promise till God meets you there. He always returns by way of His promises. --Selected.\\n\\n 　 五月七日\\n\\n “耶稣设一个比喻，是要人常常祷告，不可灰心”（路十八：1）。\\n\\n 　　祷告生活中顶普遍的失败，就是缺少恒心。我们开始为某件事祈求；祈求了一日，一星期，一月；如果一无所得，我们就立刻灰心，认为无望了；于是在祷告中再不提起了。\\n\\n 　　这是顶大的错误。有始无终的人在无论什么事上都是无结果的。\\n\\n 　　有了有始无终的习惯，就是有了失败的命定。半途而废的祷告也是如此。\\n\\n 　　灰心生失望，失望生不信，不信生失败——这都是祷告的致命伤。\\n\\n 　　有人问说：“我们祷告，应该到什么时侯为止呢？难道不能把事情交在神手中而停止祷告么”？\\n\\n 　　只有一个答复：祷告到你已经得着你所求的，或者到你心中已有确实的把握——信神必为你成就的时候为止。\\n\\n 　　只有这二处我们可以停止我们的祷告，因为祷告不只是呼求神，也是抵挡撒但。神常用我们的祷告来使我们制服撒但，所以只有神，不是我们能随便停止祷告。\\n\\n 　　但愿我们不敢随意停止祷告，除非答应已经来到了，或者已经有把握了。在第一处我们可以停止祷告，因为我们看见了。在第二处我们可以停止祷告，因为信心的眼睛也已经看见了。——译自祈祷训练\\n\\n 　　在祷告生活中，有了长期的经验，我们就能认识这是神赐的“把握”，而知道什么时候可以停止，什么时候应当继续祈求，直到获得回音。\\n\\n 　　停留在神的应许上，直到你在那里遇见了神。——选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5116.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
