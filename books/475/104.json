{"id":15061,"no":104,"title":"April 14","content":"\"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" (1 Thess. 4:16, 17)\n It was \"very early in the morning\" while \"it was yet dark,\" that Jesus rose from the dead. Not the sun, but only the morning-star shone upon His opening tomb. The shadows had not fled, the citizens of Jerusalem had not awaked. It was still night--the hour of sleep and darkness, when He arose. Nor did his rising break the slumbers of the city. So shall it be \"very early in the morning while it is yet dark,\" and when nought but the morning-star is shining, that Christ\u0027s body, the Church, shall arise. Like Him, His saints shall awake when the children of the night and darkness are still sleeping their sleep of death. In their arising they disturb no one. The world hears not the voice that summons them. As Jesus laid them quietly to rest, each in his own still tomb, like children in the arms of their mother; so, as quietly, as gently, shall He awake them when the hour arrives. To them come the quickening words, \"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust\" (Isa. 26:19). Into their tomb the earliest ray of glory finds its way. They drink in the first gleams of morning, while as yet the eastern clouds give but the faintest signs of the uprising. Its genial fragrance, its soothing stillness, its bracing freshness, its sweet loneliness, its quiet purity, all so solemn and yet so full of hope, these are theirs.\n Oh, the contrast between these things and the dark night through which they have passed! Oh, the contrast between these things and the grave from which they have sprung! And as they shake off the encumbering turf, flinging mortality aside, and rising, in glorified bodies, to meet their Lord in the air, they are lighted and guided upward, along the untrodden pathway, by the beams of that Star of the morning, which, like the Star of Bethlehem, conducts them to the presence of the King. \"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" --Horatius Bonar.\n \"While the hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,\n With glorified saints and the angels attending,\n With grace on His brow, like, a halo of glory,\n Will Jesus receive His own.\"\n \"Even so, come quickly.\"\n A soldier said, \"When I die do not sound taps over my grave, but reveillé, the morning call, the summons to rise.\"\n 　 四月十四日\n “因为主必亲自从天降临，有呼叫的声音，和天使长的声音，又有神的号吹响；那在基督里死了的人必先复活。以后我们这活着还存留的人，必和他们一同被提到云里，在空中与主相遇；这样，我们就要和主永远同在”（帖前四：16/17）。\n 　“清早，还黑的时候”（约二十：1），主耶稣从死里复活了。没有太阳，只有晨星发光照在那挪开的坟墓上。黑夜还没有退去，耶路撒冷的市民还没有睡醒。因此，教会的复兴，也要在天尚未亮的凌晨只有晨星在照耀的时候。门徒们也跟他一样，也要趁云夜的子民们仍在沉睡的时候醒来。门徒们起身，不惊动任何人。世间也听不见他们被呼召的声音，主耶稣悄悄地使他们各自安息，好象孩子躺在母亲的怀中一样；当时候来到，他也要悄悄地用温柔的声音叫醒他们。因为苏醒的人，才能听到了呼召的声音说：“睡在尘埃的呀，要醒来歌唱”。（赛二十六：19）破晓的阳光射入在门徒们中间，他们沐浴着晨曦，其时东方的云彩淡淡一抹，只露出极微薄的日出迹象。那轻轻的芳香，平和的宁静，振奋的清新，甜蜜的沉静，朴素的纯净；一切庄严肃穆，同时又充满了希望，这一切都是他们的了。\n 　　哦，这一切和他们所经过的黑夜，是如何鲜明的对照；这一切和他们刚才脱离的坟墓，又是如何鲜明的对照！他们抖掉盖在身上的尘土撇开死神，以蒙受尊荣的形体上升，去和主在空中相会，其时，他们由晨星的光所烛照和引导，沿着无人踏过的路径上升，那颗晨星就象耶稣降生时的伯利恒之星，带领他们到万王之王的面前。“你可能整夜哭泣，欢乐却在早晨来临”。——布纳\n 天使天军高喊“和散那”，耶稣从天下降\n 圣徒和天使随侍在旁，\n 额上显现着一圈神圣荣光，\n 他是来接他的子民，\n 仍愿他快来，这是我们的希望。\n 　一位兵士说：“当我死在我坟墓上不要吹熄灯，和就寝的号角，要催促我起床的晨号。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5040.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
