{"id":14982,"no":25,"title":"January 25","content":"\"…Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me….\" (Psa. 23:4) \n \n At my father\u0027s house in the country there is a little closet in the chimney corner where are kept the canes and walking-sticks of several generations of our family. In my visits to the old house, when my father and I are going out for a walk, we often go to the cane closet, and pick out our sticks to suit the fancy of the occasion. In this I have frequently been reminded that the Word of God is a staff. \n \n During the war, when the season of discouragement and impending danger was upon us, the verse, \"He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord,\" (Ps.112:7) was a staff to walk with many dark days. \n \n When death took away our child and left us almost heartbroken, I found another staff in the promise that \"weeping may endure for the night, but joy cometh in the morning.\"(Ps.30:5) \n \n When in impaired health, I was exiled for a year, not knowing whether I should be permitted to return to my home and work again, I took with me this staff which never failed, \"He knoweth the thoughts that he thinketh toward me, thoughts of peace and not of evil.\"(Jer.29:11) \n \n In times of special danger or doubt, when human judgment has seemed to be set at naught, I have found it easy to go forward with this staff, \"……In quietness and confidence shall be your strength…….\"(Is.30:15) And in emergencies, when there has seemed to be no adequate time for deliberation or for action, I have never found that this staff has failed me, \"……He that believeth shall not make haste.\"(Is.28:16) ━Benjamin Vaughan Abbott, in The Outlook. \n \n \"I had never known,\" said Martin Luther\u0027s wife, \"what such and such things meant, in such and such psalms, such complaints and workings of spirit; I had never understood the practice of Christian duties, had not God brought me under some affliction.\" It is very true that God\u0027s rod is as the schoolmaster\u0027s pointer to the child, pointing out the letter, that he may the better take notice of it; thus He pointeth out to us many good lessons which we should never otherwise have learned. –Selected \n \n \"God always sends His staff with His rod.\" \n \n \"Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be\" (Deut. 33:25). \n \n Each of us may be sure that if God sends us on stony paths He will provide us with strong shoes, and He will not send us out on any journey for which He does not equip us well. –Maclaren. \n \n 一月二十五日 \n \n “…祢的杖，祢的竿，都安慰我…” （诗廿三：4） \n \n 　　在我父亲的家中有一个小房间，里面藏着我家几代所用的许多手杖。有的是爬山用的，有的是走平坦大道用的，有的是走泥泞之地用的，有的是雨后雪后行路用的，每种手杖的样式各不相同。有时我回故乡去探望父亲，他老人家常喜欢和我出外散步；每次出发之前，我们总先到手杖室中去拣选我们那一次所适用的手杖。因此我常常想起神的话语是我们生活中的手杖，会给我无限帮助和安慰。 \n \n 　　在打仗的时候，紧急的风声使我们心慌意乱，神给我们的杖是：“他必不怕凶恶的信息；他心坚定，依靠耶和华”（诗一一二：7）。这杖扶持我们经过许多黑暗的日子。 \n \n 　　当死亡夺去我们的孩子，使我们心碎的时候，我在应许中找到另一根安慰的杖：“……一宿虽然有哭泣，早晨便必欢呼”（诗三十：5） \n \n 　　有一次我病倒了，在外养病有一年之久，在这时期中我不知道究竟我是否再会恢复，再能回到我的家中去，再担任我以前的工作。在这样没有指望之中，我始终抓住神的杖。“耶和华说，我知道我向你们所怀的意念，是赐平安的意念，不是降灾祸的意念…”（耶廿九：11） \n \n 　　在危险或疑惧的时候，人的评判都说“完了”的时候，我发见了一根带领我安然过去的杖：“……你们得力在乎平静安稳……”（赛三十：15）。在遇到意外事情的时候，似乎没有一点工夫可以设法补救了，我发现了一根从来没有误过我的杖：“……信靠的人必不着急“（赛二十八：16）━亚保德便雅悯 \n \n 　　马丁路得的妻子说：“如果神不叫我经过苦难，我永远不会知道诗篇中这些话语是甚么意思；我也永远不会明白基督徒的责任是甚么。“真的，神的杖好像教员指示孩子识字的教鞭一般，指到某一个字，孩子就注意这一个字；照样，神指导我们许多有益的功课，是我们在别的地方永不会学到的。━选 \n \n 　　“神总是用祂的竿和杖指引我们。” \n \n 　　“你的鞋是铜的，铁的。你的日子如何，你的力量也必如何”（申三十三：25） \n \n 　　让我们记得：如果神要我们走在坚固的石路上，祂必先给我们穿上铁鞋或铜鞋；祂决不会不先替我们预备好了，就差我们出外去走崎岖的路。━麦克劳 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4846.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
