He got under a juniper tree, as you and I have often done; he complained and murmured, as we have often done; was unbelieving, as we have often been. But that was not the case when he really got into touch with God. Though \"a man subject to like passions as we are,\" \"he prayed praying.\" It is sublime in the original--not \"earnestly,\" but \"he prayed in prayer.\" He kept on praying. What is the lesson here? You must keep praying.\\n\\n Come up on the top of Carmel, and see that remarkable parable of Faith and Sight. It was not the descent of the fire that now was necessary, but the descent of the flood; and the man that can command the fire can command the flood by the same means and methods. We are told that he bowed himself to the ground with his face between his knees; that is, shutting out all sights and sounds. He was putting himself in a position where, beneath his mantle, he could neither see nor hear what was going forward.\\n\\n He said to his servant, \"Go and take an observation.\" He went and came back, and said--how sublimely brief! one word--\"Nothing!\"\\n\\n What do we do under such circumstances?\\n\\n We say, \"It is just as I expected!\" and we give up praying. Did Elijah? No, he said, \"Go again.\" His servant again came back and said, \"Nothing!\" \"Go again.\" \"Nothing!\"\\n\\n By and by he came back, and said, \"There is a little cloud like a man\u0027s hand.\" A man\u0027s hand had been raised in supplication, and presently down came the rain; and Ahab had not time to get back to the gate of Samaria with all his fast steeds. This is a parable of Faith and Sight--faith shutting itself up with God; sight taking observations and seeing nothing; faith going right on, and \"praying in prayer,\" with utterly hopeless reports from sight.\\n\\n Do you know how to pray that way, how to pray prevailingly? Let sight give as discouraging reports as it may, but pay no attention to these. The living God is still in the heavens and even to delay is part of His goodness. --Arthur T. Pierson.\\n\\n Each of three boys gave a definition of faith which is an illustration of the tenacity of faith. The first boy said, \"It is taking hold of Christ\"; the second, \"Keeping hold\"; and the third, \"Not letting go.\"\\n\\n 　 四月二十九日\\n\\n “以利亚与我们是一样性情的人”（雅二：17）。\\n\\n 　　我们要为此感谢神，以利亚躺在罗滕树下，诉苦埋怨，疑惑不信，真是我们的写照。但当以利亚与神交通的时候，情况立刻转变了。以利亚是与我们一样性情的人，他却祷告了又祷告。这是最重要的一点，不仅是恳切祷告，而是“他祷告了又祷告”。继续不断的祷告。我们从这一点教训上应有所得着，因其关键所在，乃是必须继续不断的祷告。\\n\\n 　　以利亚上了迦密山顶，他领悟了“信心”和“眼见”之所以不同的伟大启示。当时所需要的不是降下火来，而是降雨；能命令火的人可用同样方法命令洪水。圣经告诉我们，他屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中；使自己的视觉和听觉与外界隔绝，一切不见不闻。\\n\\n 　　以利亚对他仆人说：“你上去观看”。他去了回来，很简单地报告道：“没有什么”。\\n\\n 　　我们若处于这种情形下将如何呢？\\n\\n 　　我们会说：“这是同我所料想的一样”！于是放弃了祷告。可是以利亚是这样吗？不，他说：“再去看看”。他的仆人回来报告说：“没有什么”！“再去看”。“没有什么”。\\n\\n 　　后来，仆人回来报告道：“有手掌那么大的一小片云”。手掌大的一片云在以利亚祈祷中升起，霎时间降下雨来；亚哈虽有快马拉车，也来不及赶回撒马利亚的城门。这是信心之所以与眼见不同之处。信心把本身和外界隔绝，专心注目于神；眼见是凭观察，什么也看不到；视觉虽带来毫无希望的消息，信心则继续坚持，“祷告了又祷告”。如何方能如此祷告而发生效力呢？让视觉带来任何失望的报告，都不要加以理会。永生的神总是在天上垂听，即使延迟不答，也是出于他的美意。——披尔生\\n\\n 　　下面是三个孩子对信心所下的定义，可以说明信心坚强的程度。第一个孩子说：“信心是去握住基督”；第二个孩子说：“信心是抓牢基督”，第三个孩子说：“信心是绝不放松基督”。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5055.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
