{"id":15179,"no":222,"title":"August 10","content":"\"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was\" (John 11:6). In the forefront of this marvelous chapter stands the affirmation, \"Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,\" (John11:5) as if to teach us that at the very heart and foundation of all God\u0027s dealings with us, however dark and mysterious they may be, we must dare to believe in and assert the infinite, unmerited, and unchanging love of God. Love permits pain. The sisters never doubted that He would speed at all hazards and stay their brother from death, but, \"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.\" What a startling \"therefore\"! He abstained from going, not because He did not love them, but because He did love them. His love alone kept Him back from hasting at once to the dear and stricken home. Anything less than infinite love must have rushed instantly to the relief of those loved and troubled hearts, to stay their grief and to have the luxury of wiping and stanching their tears and causing sorrow and sighing to flee away. Divine love could alone hold back the impetuosity of the Savior\u0027s tender-heartedness until the Angel of Pain had done her work. Who can estimate how much we owe to suffering and pain? But for them we should have little scope for many of the chief virtues of the Christian life. Where were faith, without trial to test it; or patience, with nothing to bear; or experience, without tribulation to develop it?--Selected “Loved! then the way will not be drear; For One we know is ever near, Proving it to our hearts so clear That we are loved.” “Loved when our sky is clouded o\u0027er, And days of sorrow press us sore; Still we will trust Him evermore, For we are loved.” “Time, that affects all things below, Can never change the love He\u0027ll show; The heart of Christ with love will flow, And we are loved.” 八月十日 「听见拉撒路病了，就在所居之地，仍住了两天。」（约十一6） 在前一节圣经里，我们明明看见：「耶稣素来爱马大和她的妹子，并拉撒路」（约十一5）。怎么祂所爱的人病了，还不立即前去呢？这就是告诉我们：神对付我们的方法，无论怎样严厉、怎样神秘，我们仍可相信并断言神的爱是无限的、丰裕的、不变的，按照马大和马利亚姊妹两人的心理想来，耶稣一听到拉撒路生病的消息，一定会立即不顾一切地赶去医治她们的兄弟，但是，耶稣怎样呢？「听见拉撒路病了，就在所居之地，仍住了两天。」 祂不立即前去，并不是因为不爱她们，乃是因为爱她们。惟有祂的爱能保持祂不立即赶往祂所亲爱的那个忧伤的家庭去。主若没有无限的爱，就会立即跑去安慰那些所爱的、困恼的心，止住他们的忧愁、揩干她们的眼泪、消解她们的悲哀和叹息。只有神的爱，能不急躁━能任天使做完祂要做的工。 在许多事情，我们不能不归功于患难和痛苦。基督人生活上有许多美德，都是由患难和痛苦来的；因为没有试炼，就没有信心；没有需要容忍的事情，就没有忍耐；没有艰难就没有经历。──选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5306.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
