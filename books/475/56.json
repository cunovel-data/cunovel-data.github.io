{"id":15013,"no":56,"title":"February 25","content":"\"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.\" (Joshua 1:3)\\n\\n Beside the literal ground, unoccupied for Christ, there is the unclaimed, untrodden territory of Divine promises. What did God say to Joshua? \"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you,\" and then He draws the outlines of the Land of Promise━all theirs on one condition: that they shall march through the length and breadth of it, and measure it off with their own feet.\\n\\n They never did that to more than one-third of the property, and consequently they never had more than one-third; they had just what they measured off, and no more.\\n\\n In 2 Peter, we read of the \"land of promise\" that is opened up to us, and it is God\u0027s will that we should, as it were, measure off that territory by the feet of obedient faith and believing obedience, thus claiming and appropriating it for our own.\\n\\n How many of us have ever taken possession of the promises of God in the name of Christ?\\n\\n Here is a magnificent territory for faith to lay hold on and march through the length and breadth of, and faith has never done it yet.\\n\\n Let us enter into all our inheritance. Let us lift up our eyes to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west, and hear Him say, \"All the land that thou seest will I give to thee.\"(Gen.13:14-15) ━A. T. Pierson.\\n\\n Wherever Judah should set his foot that should be his; wherever Benjamin should set his foot, that should be his. Each should get his inheritance by setting his foot upon it. Now, think you not, when either had set his foot upon a given territory, he did not instantly and instinctively feel, \"This is mine\"?\\n\\n An old colored man, who had a marvelous experience in grace, was asked: \"Daniel, why is it that you have so much peace and joy in religion?\" \"O Massa!\" he replied, \"I just fall flat on the exceeding great and precious promises, and I have all that is in them. Glory! Glory!\" He who falls flat on the promises feels that all the riches embraced in them are his. ━Faith Papers\\n\\n 二月二十五日\\n\\n 　　“凡你们脚掌所踏之地，我都…赐给你们了”（书一：3）\\n\\n 　　今天除了有许多地方我们还没有得来归主以外，还有许多神给的应许，我们也没有得到。神对乔舒亚讲甚么呢？“凡你们脚掌所踏之地，我都…赐给你们了”，于是神也把那应许之地的地界画给他们看━只要是他们脚掌走遍的地方，都归给他们。\\n\\n 　　可是他们从来没有完全走遍神所指定的境地，他们只走遍地的三分之一；结果，他们从来没有完全得着，他们只得着地的三分之一；他们所得着的，正是他们所走遍的，一点都不多。\\n\\n 　　在彼得后书，我们看见“主所应许的尚未成就”，神的旨意仍旧要我们用信心和顺服的脚掌去走遍，然后纔得到。\\n\\n 　　今天我们中间有多少信徒曾藉基督的名得到神应许的实现呢？\\n\\n 　　在我们面前有一块宽广的地业，需要我们用信心的脚掌去走遍的，可是我们至今还没有起步。\\n\\n 　　让我们起来去占有神给我们的一切产业罢！让我们举目向东西南北观看。听神对我们说：“凡你所看见的一切地，我都要赐给你”（创十三：14-15）。━裴尔逊\\n\\n 　　凡是犹大脚掌所踏之地，就归犹大；凡是便雅悯脚掌所踏之地，就归便雅悯。每支派都是这样，只要脚掌一踏下去，那地就归他们。这样，你想，岂不是他们的脚掌一踏下去的时侯，立刻就会顶自然地觉得，“这是我的了”？\\n\\n 　　有一次，有人问一位黑种年老而灵历很深的弟兄：“但以理，为甚么你有这样多的平安与喜乐“？他回答说：“哦，先生！我只仆在神极大且极宝贝的应许上，把神应许中一切的丰富算作我的，我就得着了。荣耀啊！荣耀啊“！凡仆在神应许上的，就得着神所有的丰富。━译自信报\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4871.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
