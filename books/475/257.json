{"id":15214,"no":257,"title":"September 14","content":"\"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me\" (Mark 8:34).\\n\\n The cross which my Lord bids me take up and carry may assume different shapes. I may have to content myself with a lowly and narrow sphere, when I feel that I have capacities for much higher work. I may have to go on cultivating year after year, a field which seems to yield me no harvests whatsoever. I may be bidden to cherish kind and loving thoughts about someone who has wronged me--be bidden speak to him tenderly, and take his part against all who oppose him, and crown him with sympathy and succor. I may have to confess my Master amongst those who do not wish to be reminded of Him and His claims. I may be called to \"move among my race, and show a glorious morning face,\" when my heart is breaking. \\n\\n There are many crosses, and every one of them is sore and heavy. None of them is likely to be sought out by me of my own accord. But never is Jesus so near me as when I lift my cross, and lay it submissively on my shoulder, and give it the welcome of a patient and unmurmuring spirit. \\n\\n He draws close, to ripen my wisdom, to deepen my peace, to increase my courage, to augment my power to be of use to others, through the very experience which is so grievous and distressing, and then--as I read on the seal of one of those Scottish Covenanters whom Claverhouse imprisoned on the lonely Bass, with the sea surging and sobbing round--I grow under the load.--Alexander Smellie. \\n\\n \"Use your cross as a crutch to help you on, and not as a stumblingblock to cast you down.\"\\n\\n “You may others from sadness to gladness beguile, If you carry your cross with a smile” \\n\\n 九月十四日 \\n\\n 「若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。」（可八34）\\n\\n 我主所吩咐我背的十字架，形状大小，都是祂亲自拟定的。当我觉得有能力做大事业的时候，也许我的十字架要我怀着知足的心，在一个粗陋狭窄的工场里安心工作；或者在一个似乎没有果子可结的田地里，一年过一年地继续耕种下去。也许我的十字架要我用仁慈恩惠去爱一个曾经虐待过我的仇人－－用温柔的态度去和他讲话，去站在他一边帮他抵抗一切反对他的人，用同情和援助去抬举他。也许我的十字架要我在那些不愿意听见神的名字的人中间承认基督；也许我的十字架要我在心碎的时候，到人们面前去露一个早晨的荣脸。 \\n\\n 十字架的大小种类，各有不同，但是每一个都是痛而且重的。我找不出一个合乎理想的。但是当我举起我的十字架来，顺顺服服地把它背在肩上，用忍耐不挠的精神去欢迎它的时候，乃是主离我最近的时候。\\n\\n 主常在我最忧愁最痛苦的时候，加添我的智慧，加深我的平安，加增我的勇气，加大我的能力。－－司买莉\\n\\n 用你的十字架来做帮助你前进的拐杖，不要用你的十字架做绊倒你的绊脚石。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5405.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
