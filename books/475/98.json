Here it is: \"Therefore I take pleasure in being without strength, in insults, in being pinched, in being chased about, in being cooped up in a corner for Christ\u0027s sake; for when I am without strength, then am I dynamite.\"\n Here is the secret of Divine all-sufficiency, to come to the end of everything in ourselves and in our circumstances. When we reach this place, we will stop asking for sympathy because of our hard situation or bad treatment, for we will recognize these things as the very conditions of our blessing, and we will turn from them to God and find in them a claim upon Him. --A. B. Simpson.\n George Matheson, the well-known blind preacher of Scotland, who recently went to be with the Lord, said: \"My God, I have never thanked Thee for my thorn. I have thanked Thee a thousand times for my roses, but not once for my thorn. I have been looking forward to a world where I shall get compensation for my cross; but I have never thought of my cross as itself a present glory.\n \"Teach me the glory of my cross; teach me the value of my thorn. Show me that I have climbed to Thee by the path of pain. Show me that my tears have made my rainbows.\"\n \"Alas for him who never sees \n The stars shine through the cypress trees.\"\n 　 四月八日\n “我为基督的缘故，就以软弱，凌辱，急难，逼迫，困苦，为可喜乐的。因我什么时侯软弱，什么时侯就刚强了“（林后十二：10）。\n 　　若是把这一节圣经直译出来，是非常有力的。直译该是：“我为基督的缘故，就是没有力量，被人侮辱，受折磨，被追赶，关入绝境，还是喜乐的，因我什么时侯没有力量，什么时侯就像炸药一般猛烈”。\n 　　这是得神够用恩典的秘诀：就是承认我们自己的环境和一切都已完了。当我们到了这种境地的时候，我们就不会再去求人的同情了。所以所有的患难，痛苦，都是我们得祝福的条件，我们可以藉此向神有所要求。——信宣\n 　　苏格兰（Scotland）的盲目布道家马得胜（George Matheson）说：“我的神啊，我从来没有为我的遭遇感谢过你。我曾为我的玫瑰感谢你过一千次，却没有为我的刺感谢你过一次。我一直注目仰望那个因背十字架而得的奖赏，却从来没有想到十字架本身就是现在荣耀的奖赏。\n 　　求你给我知道十字架的荣耀；求你给我知道刺的价值。求你给我看见痛苦的路径是到你那里去的梯级；求你给我看见我的眼泪是筑成虹彩的材料”。\n “未见穿过柏树的星光，\n 将是人生莫大的悲伤”。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5034.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
