Oh, how gaily they bloomed. They were planted late. On the sides were yet fresh blossoming flowers, while the tops had gone to seed. Early frosts came, and I found one day that that long line of radiant beauty was seared, and I said, \"Ah! the season is too much for them; they have perished\"; and I bade them farewell. \\n\\n I disliked to go and look at the bed, it looked so like a graveyard of flowers. But, four or five weeks ago one of my men called my attention to the fact that along the whole line of that bed there were asters coming up in the greatest abundance; and I looked, and behold, for every plant that I thought the winter had destroyed there were fifty plants that it had planted. What did those frosts and surly winds do? \\n\\n They caught my flowers, they slew them, they cast them to the ground, they trod with snowy feet upon them, and they said, leaving their work, \"This is the end of you.\" And the next spring there were for every root, fifty witnesses to rise up and say, \"By death we live.\"\\n\\n And as it is in the floral tribe, so it is in God\u0027s kingdom. By death came everlasting life. By crucifixion and the sepulchre came the throne and the palace of the Eternal God. By overthrow came victory.\\n\\n Do not be afraid to suffer. Do not be afraid to be overthrown. \\n\\n It is by being cast down and not destroyed; it is by being shaken to pieces, and the pieces torn to shreds, that men become men of might, and that one a host; whereas men that yield to the appearance of things, and go with the world, have their quick blossoming, their momentary prosperity and then their end, which is an end forever.━Beecher \\n\\n “Measure thy life by loss and not by gain,\\n\\n Not by the wine drunk, but by the wine poured forth.\\n\\n For love’s strength standeth in love’s sacrifice,\\n\\n And he who suffers most has most to give”\\n\\n 十月十一日\\n\\n 「似乎要死，却是活着。」 （林后六:9）\\n\\n 有一年夏天，我在乡间园子里修了一个长方形的花圃，种着紫菀花，花开茂盛。但它们下种是很晚，当枝顶结子的时候，两侧还在萌出鲜花。初霜降临后，我发现那些艳丽的花朵枯萎了，我叹道：「唉，它们受不住这里的气候，都完了。」我向它们告别。\\n\\n 我不愿再去看那花圃，它的样子落到好相像一个花的坟场。但到了翌年春天，有一位园丁请我注意那块花圃，已长满了极其茂盛的紫菀；我去一看，只见那我认为在去年冬季枯萎而死的每一株紫菀，却已经繁殖了五十株新苗。去冬的冰霜和寒风，完成了繁殖紫菀的任务，我问自己：是破坏呢，是建设呢！\\n\\n 当那去年冬季的寒风将紫菀花横施摧折，吹掷满地，用沾雪的脚任意践踏，并且说：「这是你们的末日。」到了第二年的春天，每一枝残花的所在却长出了根来，说道：「我们因死得生。」 \\n\\n 在植物界如此，在天国也是如此。从死亡里茁出了不朽的生命。永生真神的宝座和宫殿，得自十字架和坟墓。胜利得自失败。\\n\\n 不要怕受苦，不要怕失败。\\n\\n 凡是伟人常被打倒而未被消灭，先被折磨得片片粉碎，然后才能变成伟人，才能力敌千军；而那些只顾眼前的人，随俗浮沈，必然昙花一现，在短暂的兴旺之后，随即消逝，而永劫不复。━皮邱\\n\\n 生命要以捐失，而非收获来估计,\\n\\n 不问你之所得,而问你的所施多少,\\n\\n 因爱的力量,建立在犠牲之中,\\n\\n 受苦最多的人,施给纔会周到。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5519.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
