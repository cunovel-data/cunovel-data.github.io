{"id":15094,"no":137,"title":"May 17","content":"\"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness…an angel of the Lord…saying…now come, I will send thee into Egypt.\" (Acts 7:30-34) Often the Lord calls us aside from our work for a season, and bids us be still and learn ere we go forth again to minister. There is no time lost in such waiting hours. Fleeing from his enemies, the ancient knight found that his horse needed to be re-shod. Prudence seemed to urge him on without delay, but higher wisdom taught him to halt a few minutes at the blacksmith\u0027s forge by the way, to have the shoe replaced; and although he heard the feet of his pursuers galloping hard behind, yet he waited those minutes until his charger was refitted for his flight. And then, leaping into his saddle just as they appeared a hundred yards away, he dashed away from them with the fleetness of the wind, and knew that his halting had hastened his escape. So often God bids us tarry ere we go, and fully recover ourselves for the next stage of the journey and work. --Days of Heaven upon Earth. Waiting! Yes, patiently waiting! Till next steps made plain shall be; To hear, with the inner hearing, The Voice that will call for me. Waiting! Yes, hopefully waiting! With hope that need not grow dim; The Master is pledged to guide me, And my eyes are unto Him. Waiting! Expectantly waiting! Perhaps it may be today The Master will quickly open The gate to my future way. Waiting! Yes, waiting! still waiting! The Master will not be late: He knoweth that I am waiting For Him to unlatch the gate. --J. Danson Smith. 五月十七日 “过了四十年，在…旷野，有一位天使…显现…说…你来，我要差你往埃及去”（徒七：30/34）。 　　神常从我们工作中召我们出来，叫我们休息一时，趁此静心学习功课，然后重新出发到他所指定的工场中去工作。这段等候的时期，绝非耗废。 　　从前有一位战士，从他仇敌手中逃出来，半途发觉他的马有换马蹄铁的必要。焦急催他从速逃生，勿稍耽延，但是智慧教他停在路上一家铁匠门口，花数分钟重换马铁；虽然他听见追踪者的脚步由远而近，他仍耐性等着马铁装好。当仇敌和他只有一百码距离的时候，他一跃马鞍，似风驰去，顷刻间脱离了危险。他的暂停并不失算，反加快他的速率。 　　神也常如此：在我们工作之前叫我们有片刻的暂停，好恢复我们的体力和灵力来走前面的路程。——译自地上的天上生活 等待，等待要有耐心， 直到下一个命令来临， 用心灵之耳聆听， 神呼召的声音。 等待，以乐观之心等待， 有了希望，就不会沮丧； 主保证给我引路， 我只要依照他的方向。 等待，以希望之心等待， 也许就在此一刻， 主会突然开启了， 他的迟延决无差谬。 等待，等待，继续等待， 主不会久久不来； 他知道我在等候， 等待他把门闩拔开。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5126.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
