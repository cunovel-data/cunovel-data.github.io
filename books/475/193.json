{"id":15150,"no":193,"title":"July 12","content":"\"He hath acquainted himself with my beaten path. When he hath searched me out, I shall come out shining.\" (Job 23:10, free translation.) FAITH grows amid storms\" -just four words, but oh, how full of import to the soul who has been in the storms! Faith is that God-given faculty which, when exercised, brings the unseen into plain view, and by which the impossible things are made possible. It deals with supernaturals. But it \"grows amid storms\"; that is, where there are disturbances in the spiritual atmosphere. Storms are caused by the conflicts of elements; and the storms of the spiritual world are conflicts with hostile elements. In such an atmosphere faith finds its most productive soil; in such an element it comes more quickly to full fruition. The staunchest tree in not found in the shelter of the forest, but out in the open where the winds from every quarter beat upon it, and bend and twist it until it becomes a giant in stature-this is the tree which the mechanic wants his tools made of, and the wagon-maker seeks. So in the spiritual world, when you see a giant, remember the road you must travel to come up to his side is not along the sunny lane where wild flowers ever bloom; but a steep, rocky, narrow pathway where the blasts of hell will almost blow you off your feet; where the sharp rocks cut the flesh, where the projecting thorns scratch the brow, and the venomous beasts hiss on every side. It is a pathway of sorrow and joy, of suffering and healing balm, of tears and smiles, of trials and victories, of conflicts and triumphs, of hardships and perils and buffetings, of persecutions and misunderstandings, of troubles and distress; through all of which we are made more than conquerors through Him who loves us. \"Amid storms.\" Right in the midst where it is fiercest. You may shrink back from the ordeal of a fierce storm of trial...but go in! God is there to meet you in the center of all your trials, and to whisper His secrets which will make you come forth with a shining face and an indomitable faith that all the demons of hell shall never afterwards cause to waver. --- E. A. Kilbourne　 七月十二日 「然而祂知道我所行的路，祂试炼我之后，我必如精金。」（伯二十三:10） 　　「风雨生信心」━这不是很简单的五个字吗？但是这五个字，对于在风雨中的人是多么有意味啊！信心是神所赐的，信心经过试炼之后，能行种种神奇的事━不可见的能变成可见，不可能的能变成可能。 　　「风雨生信心」就是说，当我们在灵界上遭到困难的时候，我们的信心会得着长进。 　　最坚实的树木并不是生长在森林的庇护下的，乃是暴露在风雨打击得到的空旷之处；它们因着风雨的击打摇动，竟长得极其高大━工匠用来制作器具车辆的，就是这种木料。 　　所以，你应当常常记得你所当行的路，不是阳光闪烁、野花开放的那条，却是一条崄岨狭窄的小路，在那里阴间的狂风险些会将你吹倒，尖锐的石子会割破你的皮肉，突出的荆棘会抓伤你的头额，恶毒的野兽会在你四面吼叫。 　　这是一条又悲伤又欢乐的道路，有痛苦，也有医治；有眼泪，也有眷顾；有试炼，也有胜利。有战争，也有凯旋。路上时常会遇到困难危险、拳打掌击、逼迫误会、烦恼苦楚，然而靠着爱我们的主，在这一切的事上，已经得胜有余了。 　　在风雨最猛烈的当儿，也许你会退缩…但是你只管前进，神要在你试炼的中心与你会面，祂要将祂的奥秘告诉你，使你出来的时候，脸上带着「精金」一般的光彩，心中带着坚定不屈的信心，甚至阴间里的鬼魔再也不能摇动你。──吉博文","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5263.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
