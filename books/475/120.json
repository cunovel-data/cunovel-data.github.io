{"id":15077,"no":120,"title":"April 30","content":"\"And the ill favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well favored and fat kine…and the thin, ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears.\" (Gen. 41:47)\\n\\n There is a warning for us in that dream, just as it stands: It is possible for the best years of our life, the best experiences, the best victories won, the best service rendered, to be swallowed up by times of failure, defeat, dishonor, uselessness in the kingdom. Some men\u0027s lives of rare promise and rare achievement have ended so. It is awful to think of, but it is true. Yet it is never necessary.\\n\\n S. D. Gordon has said that the only assurance of safety against this tragedy is \"fresh touch with God,\" daily, hourly. The blessed, fruitful, victorious experiences of yesterday are not only of no value to me today, but they will actually be eaten up or reversed by today\u0027s failures, unless they serve as incentives to still better, richer experiences today.\\n\\n \"Fresh touch with God,\" by abiding in Christ, alone will keep the lean kine and the ill favored grain out of my life. --Messages for the Morning Watch.\\n\\n 　 四月三十日\\n\\n “这又丑陋，又干瘦的七只母牛，吃尽了那又美好，又肥壮的七只母牛…这细弱的穗子，吞了那七个又肥大又饱满的穗子”（创四十一：4，7）。\\n\\n 　　埃及法老的梦也给我们一个警告：我们一生最得意的几年，最宝贵的经历，最可夸的得胜，最有效的事奉，常会被后来的软弱，失败，跌倒，灰心，冷淡，退缩……等等吞吃去。许多成大事业的伟人，往往如此结果。想起了也觉得可怕。虽然这是的确的事实，但并非是必须有，而不可避免的。\\n\\n 　　戈登说：要避免这种悲剧，只有一个稳妥的方法，就是时时与神有新鲜的接触。昨天最光荣的胜利，在今天并不发生什么功效，最多只能作一种得更深更丰经历的参考罢了。\\n\\n 　　只有与神发生新鲜的接触——能使我们生命中的瘦牛和细穗跑掉。——译自晨更信息\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5056.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
