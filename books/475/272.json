{"id":15229,"no":272,"title":"September 29","content":"\"I will give myself unto prayer\" (Ps. 109:4)\n We are often in a religious hurry in our devotions. How much time do we spend in them daily? Can it not be easily reckoned in minutes? Who ever knew an eminently holy man who did not spend much of his time in prayer? Did ever a man exhibit much of the spirit of prayer, who did not devote much time in his closet? \n Whitefield says, \"Whole days and weeks have I spent prostrate on the ground, in silent or vocal prayer.\" \"Fall upon your knees and grow there,\" is the language of another, who knew whereof he affirmed.\n It has been said that no great work in literature or science was ever wrought by a man who did not love solitude. We may lay it down as an elemental principle of religion, that no large growth in holiness was ever gained by one who did not take time to be often, and long, alone with God. --The Still Hour\n “Come come, He saith, O soul oppressed and weary,\n Come to the shadows of my desert rest;\n Come walk with Me far from life’s babbling discords,\n And peace shall breathe like music in thy breast.”\n 九月二十九日\n 「我专心祈祷。」（诗一○九4）\n 我们祷告的时间常顶匆促、顶急忙。每天我们究竟花多少时间来祷告呢？岂不是很容易以分来计算━最多数分钟，数十分钟吗？谁曾看见过一个灵界的伟人未曾花许多时间来祷告的呢？谁曾看见过一个被圣灵充满的人未曾花许多时间专心在密室中的呢？ \n 华德飞说：「数日数夜，甚至数星期，我平卧地上专心祷告━有时出声，有时不出声。」还有一位祷告有经验的说：「双膝跪下来，就在那里长进。」他知道他所说的是甚么。\n 有人说，一个不喜爱单独的人，绝不能在文学上或者科学上有所成功。属灵的事情也是这样，一个不常花长时间与神单独亲近的人，绝不能在属灵的事情上得到多大的长进－－译自静默的时候\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5420.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
