{"id":15182,"no":225,"title":"August 13","content":"\"If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth\" (Eccles. 11:3) Why, then, do we dread the clouds which now darken our sky? True, for a while they hide the sun, but the sun is not quenched; he will be out again before long. Meanwhile those black clouds are filled with rain; and the blacker they are, the more likely they will yield plentiful showers. How can we have rain without clouds? Our troubles have always brought us blessings, and they always will. They are the dark chariots of bright grace. These clouds will empty themselves before long, and every tender herb will be gladder for the shower. Our God may drench us with grief, but He will refresh us with mercy. Our Lord\u0027s love-letters often come to us in black-edged envelopes. His wagons rumble, but they are loaded with benefits. His rod blossoms with sweet flowers and nourishing fruits. Let us not worry about the clouds, but sing because May flowers are brought to us through the April clouds and showers. O Lord, the clouds are the dust of Thy feet! How near Thou art in the cloudy and dark day! Love beholds Thee, and is glad. Faith sees the clouds emptying themselves and making the little hills rejoice on every side.--C H. Spurgeon “What seems so dark to thy dim sight May be a shadow, seen aright Making some brightness doubly bright.” “The flash that struck thy tree-no more To shelter thee-lets heaven\u0027s blue floor Shine where it never shone before.” “The cry wrung from thy spirit\u0027s pain May echo on some far-off plain, And guide a wanderer home again.” “The blue of heaven is larger than the clouds.”　 八月十三日 「云若满了雨，就必倾倒在地上。」 （传十一3）　　 这样，我们为甚么要惧怕我们环境中的黑云呢？虽然它们暂时遮蔽了太阳，但是太阳并没有熄灭；不久它仍旧会出来的。云里充满了雨；云越黑，下雨的希望越大。 没有云，我们怎么能有雨呢？我们的患难，常将祝福带来给我们。它们是装载恩典的黑车。看啊，黑云不久就要变成细雨了；那时候，每一种植物都会因着所下的雨欢乐。我们的神虽然用灾祸压伤我们，却要用怜悯医治我们。祂给我们情书，总是用黑边信封封来的。祂的货车虽然发出辚辚的粗声来，其上所装载的，却是满溢的恩泽。祂的杖，开着芳香的花卉和甘甜的果实。所以，我们不要再为着黑云烦恼罢，我们应当歌唱，因为五月里的花草，是四月里的云雨带给我们的。 主阿，黑云是祢的脚前的尘埃！在黑云满布的日子，祢和我是隔得多近啊！─","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5309.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
