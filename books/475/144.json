{"id":15101,"no":144,"title":"May 24","content":"\"Sarah bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.\" (Gen. 21:2)\n The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations\" (Psalm 33:11). But we must be prepared to wait God\u0027s time. God has His set times. It is not for us to know them; indeed, we cannot know them; we must wait for them.\n If God had told Abraham in Haran that he must wait for thirty years until he pressed the promised child to his bosom, his heart would have failed him. So, in gracious love, the length of the weary years was hidden, and only as they were nearly spent, and there were only a few more months to wait, God told him that \"according to the time of life, Sarah shall have a son.\" (Gen. 18:14.)\n The set time came at last; and then the laughter that filled the patriarch\u0027s home made the aged pair forget the long and weary vigil.\n Take heart, waiting one, thou waitest for One who cannot disappoint thee; and who will not be five minutes behind the appointed moment: ere long \"your sorrow shall be turned into joy.\"\n Ah, happy soul, when God makes thee laugh! Then sorrow and crying shall flee away forever, as darkness before the dawn. --Selected.\n It is not for us who are passengers, to meddle with the chart and with the compass. Let that all-skilled Pilot alone with His own work. –Hall.\n \"Some things cannot be done in a day. God does not make a sunset glory in a moment, but for days may be massing the mist out of which He builds His palaces beautiful in the west.\"\n \"Some glorious morn--but when? Ah, who shall say?\n The steepest mountain will become a plain,\n And the parched land be satisfied with rain.\n The gates of brass all broken; iron bars,\n Transfigured, form a ladder to the stars.\n Rough places plain, and crooked ways all straight, \n For him who with a patient heart can wait.\n These things shall be on God\u0027s appointed day:\n It may not be tomorrow--yet it may.\"\n 　 五月二十四日\n “当亚伯拉罕年老的时候，撒拉怀了孕；到神所说的日期，就给亚伯拉罕生了一个儿子”（创二十一：2）。\n 　　“耶和华的筹算永远立定，他心中的思念万代常存”（诗三十三：11）。但是我们必须预备等待神的时间。神有他的定时，我们不能预知；只能等待。\n 　　如果神在哈兰，就告诉亚伯拉罕：他必须等待三十年，然后才得到以撒，亚伯拉罕的心要何等难过呢！所以，这是神的爱——神特意将这长而乏味的时期不说，只说“到了日期，撒拉必生一个儿子”。\n 　　最后，神的定时来了；喜乐充满了信心之父的家；这对年老的夫妇忘了他们所等的长而乏味的时期。\n 　　啊，焦急的信徒们啊，你要知道你所等的那一个，是不会叫你失望的；他不会比定时迟五分钟的：不久“你们的忧愁，要变为喜乐”（约十六：20）。神要使你欢笑！忧愁要在你面前逃跑，好像黑暗在早晨前逃跑一般。——选\n 　　我们是船上的乘客，尽可不必去过问那航海图与罗盘针。让全能的舵手单独去驾驶吧。\n 　　有的事情绝非一天之内可以完成的。神并非在片刻之间构成落日时的彩霞，他要经过好几天的积聚云雾，才在天的西边造成了那美丽的宫殿。\n 光荣的黎明，谁能说何时出现？\n 到那时崎岖的地形将变为平原，\n 干枯的土地有充分的雨水，\n 紧锁的铜门，再不将你阻拦，\n 铁栅改成阶梯，通往天国堂殿，\n 平原千里，弯曲的道路都修齐，\n 一切都为了那些忍耐等候的人。\n 何时出现？神会确定他的时间，\n 也许不是明天，也许就是明天。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5133.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
