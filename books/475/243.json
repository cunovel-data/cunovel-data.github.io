How strong is the snare of the things that are seen, and how necessary for God to keep us in the things that axe unseen! If Peter is to walk on the water he must walk; if he is going to swim, he must swim, but he cannot do both. If the bird is going to fly it must keep away from fences and the trees, and trust to its buoyant wings. But if it tries to keep within easy reach of the ground, it will make poor work of flying. God had to bring Abraham to the end of his own strength, and to let him see that in his own body he could do nothing. He had to consider his own body as good as dead, and then take God for the whole work; and when he looked away from himself, and trusted God alone, then he became fully persuaded that what He had promised, He was able to perform. That is what God is teaching us, and He has to keep away encouraging results until we learn to trust without them, and then He loves to make His Word real in fact as well as faith.--A.B. Simpson I do not ask that He must prove His Word is true to me, And that before I can believe He first must let me see. It is enough for me to know \u0027Tis true because He says \u0027tis so; On His unchanging Word I\u0027ll stand And trust till I can understand. -E.M.Winter 八月三十一日 「那没有看见就信的，有福了。」（约廿29） 眼见的事物是多么靠不住。所以，神必须保守我们在看不见的事物里，这是多么要紧的一回事！如果一只鸟儿要飞，牠必须离开墙垣和树枝，单独信赖牠的翅膀。如果牠要接近地面，牠飞行的工作就要受到亏损。 亚伯拉罕必须先看见自己的力量完了，自己不能再做甚么了，自己已经死了，然后纔肯完全让神来做；当他不看自己，单独信靠神的时候，他纔能完全相信：神所允许的，必能做成。这就是现在神所要我们学习的功课；神必须拿去一切鼓励我们的东西，直到我们能够不凭东西来信靠祂；那时候祂就要叫祂的话语成为事实。－－信宣","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5327.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
