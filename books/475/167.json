{"id":15124,"no":167,"title":"June 16","content":"\"My expectation is from him.\" (Psalm 62:5)\n Our too general neglect of looking for answers to what we ask, shows how little we are in earnest in our petitions. A husbandman is not content without the harvest; a marksman will observe whether the ball hits the target; a physician watches the effect of the medicine which he gives; and shall the Christian be careless about the effect of his labor?\n Every prayer of the Christian, made in faith, according to the will of God, for which God has promised, offered up in the name of Jesus Christ, and under the influence of the Spirit, whether for temporal or for spiritual blessings, is, or will be, fully answered.\n God always answers the general design and intention of His people\u0027s prayers, in doing that which, all things considered, is most for His own glory and their spiritual and eternal welfare. As we never find that Jesus Christ rejected a single supplicant who came to Him for mercy, so we believe that no prayer made in His name will be in vain.\n The answer to prayer may be approaching, though we discern not its coming. The seed that lies under ground in winter is taking root in order to a spring and harvest, though it appears not above ground, but seems dead and lost. --Bickersteth.\n Delayed answers to prayer are not only trials of faith, but they give us opportunities of honoring God by our steadfast confidence in Him under apparent repulses. --C. H. Spurgeon.\n 　 六月十六日\n “我的盼望是从他而来”（诗六十二：5）。\n 　　我们祷告了以后，常不关心神的答应是否来到，这就表明我们的祷告并不诚恳。农夫的注意力集中于收获，医生的注意力集中于药的功效；一个祷告的基督徒岂可漠然不关心神的答应呢？\n 　基督徒每一次的祷告，若有信心，符合神的旨意和应许，奉主名祈求，无有不被神答应的。\n 　　神答应我们的祷告，有两个分不开的目的：荣耀自己的名和祝福他的儿女。当初人到主面前来求怜悯，他从未拒绝过；今天奉他的名到神前来，也决不会被拒绝的。\n 　　祷告的答应或许就要来了，虽然我们看不见它的来到。种子埋在土中伸根，在上面看来，一点没有动静，好似死了一般。——别克司蒂\n 　　祷告的答应耽延，不单是信心的试炼，也是我们用坚信来尊重神的机会。——司布真\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5170.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
