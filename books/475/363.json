Be not slothful to go, and enter to possess the land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth” (Judges 18:9-10) Arise! Then there is something definite for us to do. Nothing is ours unless we take it. “The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance” (Josh.16:4) “The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions” (Obad.17) “The upright shall have good things in possession.” (Prov.28:10) We need to have appropriating faith in regard to God\u0027s promises. We must make God\u0027s Word our own personal possession. A child was asked once what appropriating faith was, and the answer was, “It is taking a pencil and underscoring all the me\u0027s and mine\u0027s and my\u0027s in the Bible.” Take any word you please that He has spoken and say, “That word is my word.” Put your finger on this promise and say, “It is mine.”How much of the Word has been endorsed and receipted and said “It is done.” How many promises can you subscribe and say, “Fulfilled to me.” “Son, thou art ever with Me, and all that I have is thine.” Don\u0027t let your inheritance go by default. “When faith goes to market it always takes a basket.” 十二月二十九日 「起来……我们已经窥探那地，见那地甚好。你们为何静坐不动呢？要急速前往得那地为业，不可迟延。……神已将那地交在你们手中，那地百物俱全，一无所缺。」 （士十八:9-10） 　　起来！有许多土地等着我们去得。我们如果静坐不动，没有一件东西会落到我们手中。“约瑟的儿子玛拿西、以法莲，就得了他们的地业。”（书16章4节）。“雅各家必得原有的产业”（俄17节）。“惟有完全人，必承受福份”（箴28章10节）。产业和福分都是要去得、去承受的。 　　对于神的应许，我们当有“据为己有”的信心。我们当把神的话算为我们个人的产业。有一次，一为教员问一个孩子道：“甚么是据为己有的信心？”孩子回答说：“据为己有的信心乃是：拿一支红笔，把圣经胜所有的“我”， “我的”旁边，都画上红线。” 　　凡是主所说的无论那一句话，你都可以把你的手指放在上面说：“这是我的。”读者阿，有多少应许你能说：“在我身上已经成就了”呢？ 　　“儿啊，你常和我同在，我一切所有的，都是你的。”（路15章31节）亲爱的啊，不要因懈怠失去你的遗产啊！ 　　信心上市场的时候，总是带着篮子的。━选","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5598.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
