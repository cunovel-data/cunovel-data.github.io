The dull gray will give way as God pushes the sun towards the horizon, and there will be tints and hues of every shade, that will blend into one perfect light as the full-orbed sun bursts into view. As the King of day moves forth majestically, flooding the earth and every lowly vale, listen to the music of heaven\u0027s choir as it sings of the majesty of God and the glory of the morning.\" In the holy hush of the early dawn, I hear a Voice━ “I am with you all the day, Rejoice! Rejoice!” The clear, pure light of the morning made me long for the truth in my heart, which alone could make me pure and clear as the morning, tune me up to the concert-pitch of the nature around me. And the wind that blew from the sunrise made me hope in the God who had first breathed into my nostrils the breath of life; that He would at length so fill me with His breath, His mind, His Spirit, that I should think only His thoughts, and live His life, finding therein my own life, only glorified infinitely. What should we poor humans do without our God\u0027s nights and mornings? ━George MacDonald \"In the early morning hours, \u0027Twixt the night and day, While from earth the darkness passes Silently away; \"Then \u0027tis sweet to talk with Jesus In thy chamber still━ For the coming day and duties Ask to know His will. \"Then He\u0027ll lead the way before you, Mountains laying low; Making desert places blossom, Sweet\u0027ning Marah\u0027s flow. \"Would you know this life of triumph, Victory all the way? Then put God in the beginning Of each coming day. \" 十一月二十八日 「住在地极的人，因祢的神迹惧怕。祢使日出日落之地都欢呼。」 （ 诗65：8） 早晨起身，上到山去瞧瞧神如何制造早晨，神把太阳推向地平线，朦胧的灰暗消逝，到浑圆的太阳出现之时，各种深浅的颜色，混合成了一幅完美的光彩。白昼庄严地渐渐展开，它的光明，已遍照大地和每一低谷，你可以聆听天国合唱团的乐曲，在歌颂的尊贵下和早晨的荣光。 在黎明的肃穆中, 我听见一个声音━ 「我整天都和你同在, 欢欣!欢欣!」 早晨的纯洁之光，使我的心渴慕真理，惟有这种仰望真理之心，能使我纯洁如早晨，使我和周围的自然交响乐和谐合拍起来。日出时吹来的风，使我盼望神，祂曾首先把生命的呼吸，吸进我鼻孔；盼望祂始终以祂的生气和生命来充满我，使我所想的只是祂的思想，所过的只是祂的生活，在我自己的生命中，只发现永恒的光荣。假若没有神的夜和早晨，我们这些可怜的人类该怎样办呢？━麦克唐纳 清晨，也就是 祂与日交替的时间， 黑暗正悄悄逝去， 光明已显露在天边， 此时，在祢宁静的厢房里， 最宜和耶稣作竟见的交换━ 把这一天将要来的事情， 探询祂的意愿。 然后，祂会给你领路， 使山巅不再崎岖， 沙漠中开放鲜花， 玛拉的水，甜如甘饴。 若要知道得胜的生命， 如何一路凯旋？ 就当把神高举在 每天的开端。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5567.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
