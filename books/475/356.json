Worn out with the mental conflict, the watchings, and the exertions of the day, Abraham fell into a deep sleep, and in that sleep is soul was oppressed with a dense and dreadful darkness, such as almost stifled him, and lay like a nightmare upon his heart. Do you understand something of the horror of that darkness? When some terrible sorrow which seems so hard to reconcile with perfect love, crushes down upon the soul, wringing from it all its peaceful rest in the pitifulness of God, and launching it on a sea unlit by a ray of hope; when unkindness, and cruelty maltreat the trusting heart, till it begins to doubt whether there be a God overhead who can see and still permit━these know something of the \"horror of great darkness.\" It is thus that human life is made up; brightness and gloom; shadow and sun; long tracks of cloud, succeeded by brilliant glints of light, and amid all Divine justice is working out its own schemes, affecting others equally with the individual soul which seems the subject of special discipline. O ye who are filled with the horror of great darkness because of God\u0027s dealings with mankind, learn to trust that infallible wisdom, which is co-assessor with immutable justice; and know that He who passed through the horror of the darkness of Calvary, with the cry of forsakenness, is ready to bear you company through the valley of the shadow of death till you see the sun shining upon its further side. Let us, by our Forerunner, send forward our anchor, Hope, within the veil that parts us from the unseen; where it will grapple in ground and will not yield, but hold until the day dawns, and we follow it into the haven guaranteed to us by God\u0027s immutable counsel. ━F. B. Meyer\\n\\n The disciples thought that that angry sea separated them from Jesus. Nay, some of them thought worse than that; they thought that the trouble that had come upon them was a sign that Jesus had forgotten all about them, and did not care for them. Oh, dear friend, that is when troubles have a sting, when the devil whispers, \"God has forgotten you; God has forsaken you\"; when your unbelieving heart cries as Gideon cried, \"If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?\" The evil has come upon you to bring the Lord nearer to you. The evil has not come upon you to separate you from Jesus, but to make you cling to Him more faithfully, more tenaciously, more simply. ━F. S. Webster, M.A.\\n\\n Never should we so abandon ourselves to God as when He seems to have abandoned us. Let us enjoy light and consolation when it is His pleasure to give it to us, but let us not attach ourselves to His gifts, but to Himself; and when He plunges us into the night of pure faith, let us still press on through the agonizing darkness.━Selected\\n\\n Oh, for faith that brings the triumph\\n\\n When defeat seems strangely near!\\n\\n oh, for faith that brings the triumph\\n\\n Into victory\u0027s ringing cheer一 \\n\\n Faith triumphant; knowing not defeat or fear.\\n\\n 一Herbert Booth\\n\\n 十二月二十二日 \\n\\n “忽然有惊人的大黑暗落在他身上”。（创十五：12）\\n\\n 太阳西沉，夜自东方迅速展开，给大地遮上了一层黑暗的业障。亚伯拉罕经过整天的内心争斗和努力，全神贯注的守候之后；已疲倦不堪，沉沉入睡了。就在那睡眠之中，他的灵魂被浓厚而可怖的黑暗所压迫，几乎使他窒息，象梦魇在他的心上。你认识这种黑暗惊人程度吗？有时漆黑一团的悲哀，似乎与神的爱绝不调和，压着你的灵魂，把神怜悯之心所给你的一切安息都挤压净尽，投入看不见一丝希望的海里；残酷和不仁，嘲笑着那信靠的心，直到它发生怀疑：到底天上有没有看见这一切的神？他是否允许这惊人的大黑暗？人生的构成，就是交错着光明与黑暗。阴影和太阳，层层乌云之后，紧跟着灿烂的光辉，在神的一切义行之中，都有其预定的计划，它的影响遍及于某些仿佛受有特殊教训的个别灵魂，也及于其它的灵魂啊，你们看到了那种惊人的黑暗，因为这是神为人类所作的安排，应当学会信靠那绝无错误的智慧，这和永恒之义是一体的两面；你要知道那位大声喊道：“我的神，我的神，为甚么离弃我”（太27：46）经过各各他可怖黑暗的主耶稣，他一直准备着要陪你行过死荫的幽谷，直到你们看见太阳在那一边照耀。愿我们凭着我们的先驱者，把我们的希望之锚，抛向前去，投入遮掩未来的阴暗中，安稳坚定，抓住不放，直到天光破晓，我们跟着它安全进港，这有神确定的指示给我们作过保证。━梅尔\\n\\n 门徒以为那汹涌的海水，把他们和耶稣隔离了。不但如此，有几位还作更坏的想法，以为所遭遇的患难，象征着耶稣已把他们整个忘怀，不再关心他们了。哦，亲爱的朋友，这种时候，正是患难长了毒刺，正是魔鬼对你耳语：“神已经忘记你了；神已经弃绝你了”。也就是你不信神的心，象基甸那样喊道：“耶和华若与我们同在，我们何至遭遇这一切事呢？”其实，你之遭遇患难，目的只是使你更亲近主。患难不是来隔离你和主，而是来使你更加忠贞，不屈不挠，一心一意地依附他。\\n\\n 　　唯有当我们觉得似乎神已弃绝了我们的时候，我们才把自己完全交托给神。愿我们来享受神乐意赐给我们的亮光和安慰，但愿我们所依恋的，不是他的恩赐，乃是他的自己，而当他把我们投入纯粹的信心之夜时，我们仍要在痛苦的黑暗中努力前进。━选\\n\\n 信心帶來了勝利,\\n\\n 就在即將失敗之際!\\n\\n 信心帶來了勝利,\\n\\n 震起凱旋的歡呼━ \\n\\n 得勝的信心,不知失敗或憂懼。\\n\\n 一布芙\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5591.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
