{"id":15079,"no":122,"title":"May 2","content":"\"The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.\" (Psa. 103:19)\n Some time since, in the early spring, I was going out at my door when round the corner came a blast of east wind--defiant and pitiless, fierce and withering--sending a cloud of dust before it.\n I was just taking the latchkey from the door as I said, half impatiently, \"I wish the wind would\"--I was going to say change; but the word was checked, and the sentence was never finished.\n As I went on my way, the incident became a parable to me. There came an angel holding out a key; and he said:\n \"My Master sends thee His love, and bids me give you this.\"\n \"What is it?\" I asked, wondering. \"The key of the winds,\" said the angel, and disappeared.\n Now indeed should I be happy. I hurried away up into the heights whence the winds came, and stood amongst the caves. \"I will have done with the east wind at any rate--and that shall plague us no more,\" I cried; and calling in that friendless wind, I closed the door, and heard the echoes ringing in the hollow places. I turned the key triumphantly. \"There,\" I said, now we have done with that.\"\n \"What shall I choose in its place?\" I asked myself, looking about me. \"The south wind is pleasant\"; and I thought of the lambs, and the young life on every hand, and the flowers that had begun to deck the hedgerows. But as I set the key within the door, it began to burn my hand.\n \"What am I doing?\" I cried; \"who knows what mischief I may bring about? How do I know what the fields want! Ten thousand things of ill may come of this foolish wish of mine.\"\n Bewildered and ashamed, I looked up and prayed that the Lord would send His angel yet again to take the key; and for my part I promised that I would never want to have it any more.\n But lo, the Lord Himself stood by me. He reached His hand to take the key;and as I laid it down, I saw that it rested against the sacred wound-print.\n It hurt me indeed that I could ever have murmured against anything wrought by Him who bare such sacred tokens of His love. Then He took the key and hung it on His girdle.\n \"Dost THOU keep the key of the winds?\" I asked.\n \"I do, my child,\" He answered graciously.\n And lo, I looked again and there hung all the keys of all my life. He saw my look of amazement, and asked, \"Didst thou not know, my child, that my kingdom ruleth over all?\"\n \"Over all, my Lord!\" I answered; \"then it is not safe for me to murmur at anything?\" Then did He lay His hand upon me tenderly. \"My child,\" He said, \"thy only safety is, in everything, to love and trust and praise.\" --Mark Guy Pearse.　\n 五月二日\n “耶和华在天上立定宝座；他的国统管万有”（诗一〇三：19）。\n 　　有一次，在初春的早晨，我刚开门出外，一阵残酷，无情的东风，吹着一阵灰沙，向我扑来。\n 　　我急躁地埋怨道：“我巴不得这风…”——我意思要说：“不再有”；可是这三个字在我喉间搁住了，说不出来。\n 　　在我途中，这件事继续居住在我脑海中。我把它演绎成了一段寓言故事：\n 　　一个天使来了，手中执着一把钥匙；他说：“我的主人吩咐我把这一把钥匙给你”。\n 　　我带着惊奇的口吻问道，“这是什么？“天使说，“掌管风的钥匙”，说罢便不见了。\n 　　现在我应该非常快乐了。从此可以随我的心愿，随便对付我所厌恶的风了。我急忙跑到山上，风的库房就在前面。“我无论如何必先解决寒冷的东风，使它不再为害人间”，我这样说，于是把无情的东风叫了来，关入岩穴，听它在里面咆哮。我胜利地旋上钥匙，得意地说：“问题就此解决了”。我去开启了南风的门。我顶得意地说：“世上再没有残酷，无情的冷欺人了。从此植物月月开花，季季结果；年初到年终，都是和暖，可爱的气候…”言未毕，一股热气从门里冲出来，把我的手灼得痛彻肺腑。\n 　　地上的青草一霎那间都转黄了，我的得意之作摧残了全世界的生命。我发急喊道：“我闯了多大的祸啊！我没有想到它们的需要！我真多么愚蠢”！\n 　　又惘怅，又羞愧，我求主再差遣他的天使来把钥匙拿去；我同时应许说我以后决不敢再掌管风的钥匙了。\n 　　看哪，主自己站在我旁边。他伸出有钉痕的手来把钥匙拿去，把其余三扇门都打开；空气中调剂了许多冷风，顿时觉得满身凉快了。\n 　　我这时就想到：我是谁，竟敢埋怨主所安排的呢？他把钥匙挂在腰间。\n 　　我问道：“主啊，这风的钥匙是你经管的么”？\n 　　他答道：“是的，我的孩子”。\n 　　看哪，我又看见我生活中所有的钥匙都挂在那里。他看见我脸上带着惊奇之色，就问我说：“我的孩子，你岂不知道我的国统管万有么？”\n 　　我回答说：“主啊，是的。既是你有钉痕的手——满有爱的手——使用那些钥匙，叫我遭遇平安或患难，喜乐或忧愁，顺境或逆境，从此以后，无论什么事情，我就不再埋怨；都要信靠，安息，赞美了。“——披尔斯\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5111.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
