{"id":14979,"no":22,"title":"January 22","content":"\"Into a desert place apart.\" (Matt. 14:13) \n \n \"There is no music in a rest, but there is the making of music in it.\" In our whole life-melody the music is broken off here and there by \"rests,\" and we foolishly think we have come to the end of the tune. God sends a time of forced leisure, sickness, disappointed plans, frustrated efforts, and makes a sudden pause in the choral hymn of our lives; and we lament that our voices must be silent, and our part missing in the music which ever goes up to the ear of the Creator. How does the musician read the \"rest\"? See him beat the time with unvarying count, and catch up the next note true and steady, as if no breaking place had come between. \n \n Not without design does God write the music of our lives. Be it ours to learn the tune, and not be dismayed at the \"rests.\" They are not to be slurred over, not to be omitted, not to destroy the melody, not to change the keynote. If we look up, God Himself will beat the time for us. With the eye on Him, we shall strike the next note full and clear. If we sadly say to ourselves, \"There is no music in a \u0027rest,\u0027\" let us not forget \"there is the making of music in it.\" The making of music is often a slow and painful process in this life. How patiently God works to teach us! How long He waits for us to learn the lesson! – Ruskin \n \n \"Called aside— \n \n From the glad working of thy busy life, \n \n From the world\u0027s ceaseless stir of care and strife, \n \n Into the shade and stillness by thy Heavenly Guide \n \n For a brief space thou hast been called aside. \n \n \"Called aside— \n \n Perhaps into a desert garden dim; \n \n And yet not alone, when thou hast been with Him, \n \n And heard His voice in sweetest accents say: \n \n \u0027Child, wilt thou not with Me this still hour stay?\u0027 \n \n \"Called aside— \n \n In hidden paths with Christ thy Lord to tread, \n \n Deeper to drink at the sweet Fountainhead, \n \n Closer in fellowship with Him to roam, \n \n Nearer, perchance, to feel thy Heavenly Home. \n \n \"Called aside— \n \n Oh, knowledge deeper grows with Him alone; \n \n In secret of His deeper love is shown, \n \n And learnt in many an hour of dark distress \n \n Some rare, sweet lesson of His tenderness. \n \n \"Called aside— \n \n We thank thee for the stillness and the shade; \n \n We thank Thee for the hidden paths Thy love hath made, \n \n And, so that we have wept and watched with Thee, \n \n We thank Thee for our dark Gethsemane. \n \n \"Called aside— \n \n Oh, restful thought━He doeth all things well; \n \n Oh, blessed sense, with Christ alone to dwell; \n \n So in the shadow of Thy cross to hide, \n \n We thank Thee, Lord, to have been called aside.\" \n \n 一月二十二日 \n \n “退到野地里去” （太十四：13） \n \n 　　在音乐谱中有一种符号，叫做休止符。当音乐奏到休止符时，声音完全停止；这常是音乐最精采之处。我们的一生，也如音乐一般，时时有休止符，可是我们顶愚昧，以为这些休止符是我们的末路和尽头，一生就完毕于此。神常叫我们失败，病痛，挫折，失业，我们就非常悲哀，以为我们的人生音乐从此不能再达到造物者的耳中了。可是让我们看，音乐家如何对付这些休止符呢？他们照常击拍，在休止符之后，重奏音乐，一若中间并无甚么间断。 \n \n 　　神编我们一生的乐章，并非没有计划的。我们只管按谱奏乐，不必怕遇见休止符而恐惶。它们是不能删去的，因为一删去就会破坏音乐的精采。如果我们仰望我们音乐的导师“神” 祂自己正在为我们击拍，我们的本分只是按照祂的指导奏乐；奏到休止符的时候，虽然音乐停止了，可是请记得：这是音乐的精采处。过了一拍子之久，音乐就要从新奏起。让我们学习这功课。━罗斯金 \n \n 招呼你━ \n \n 离开忙碌紧张的生活， \n \n 离开你不断搅扰的尘世烦腻， \n \n 天国的向导招呼你暂到一旁， \n \n 在宁静的荫蔽中作片刻休憩。 \n \n 招呼你━ \n \n 虽是一所杳无人迹的荒园 \n \n 但你并不孤独，因为祂与你同在， \n \n 祂以最柔美的声调向你问道： \n \n “孩子：你岂不愿意与我共此安静一刻？” \n \n 招呼你━ \n \n 去和主耶稣同步幽深， \n \n 溯源一尝甘泉的清澄， \n \n 你和祂影形不离，想携漫游， \n \n 已经接近了天国的家庭。 \n \n 招呼你━ \n \n 和祂单独相处，增进了渊博智慧， \n \n 祂的挚爱常在幽秘中显明表征， \n \n 在许多寂寞凄凉的夜晚，你将得到 \n \n 出自祂深情的珍贵良箴。 \n \n 招呼你━ \n \n 我们感谢主所赐的宁静和荫蔽， \n \n 我们感谢主，祢以爱所辟出的蹊径， \n \n 因此我们虽流着泪而注视祢。 \n \n 感谢主，祢为了我们黑暗的客西马尼。 \n \n 招呼你━ \n \n 想到祂完成了一切，我们就获得平安， \n \n 和基督单独相处，幸福美好无比， \n \n 我们躲在祢十字架的荫影下， \n \n 主啊，感谢祢招呼我们在祢一边。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4843.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
