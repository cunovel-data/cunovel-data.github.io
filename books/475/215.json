Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks. Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle, but you shall be a miracle. --Phillips Brooks. \\n\\n We must remember that it is not in any easy or self-indulgent life that Christ will lead us to greatness. The easy life leads not upward, but downward. Heaven always is above us, and we must ever be looking up toward it. These are some people who always avoid things that are costly, that require self-denial, or self-restraint and sacrifice, but toil and hardship show us the only way to nobleness. Greatness comes not by having a mossy path made for you through the meadow, but by being sent to hew out a roadway by your own hands. Are you going to reach the mountain splendors? --Selected. \\n\\n Be strong !\\n\\n We are not here to play to dream, to drift;\\n\\n We have hard work to do, and loads to lift.\\n\\n Shun not the struggle; face it. Tis God\u0027s gift.\\n\\n Be strong !\\n\\n Say not the days are evil-Who\u0027s to blame?\\n\\n And fold the hands and acquiesce-O shame!\\n\\n Stand up, speak out, and bravely, In God\u0027s name.\\n\\n Be strong !\\n\\n It matters not how deep entrenched the wrong,\\n\\n How hard the battle goes, the day how long,\\n\\n Faint not, fight on.! Tomorrow comes the song.\\n\\n -Maltbie D. Babcock \\n\\n 八月三日\\n\\n 「要作大丈夫，要刚强。」（林前十六13） \\n\\n 不要求安乐的生活，要求作刚强的大丈夫。不要求与你能力相等的工作，要求与你工作相等的能力。这样，你所行的算不得神迹，你自己却是一个神迹。━白罗克斯\\n\\n 我们必须记得：在一个安乐的、放纵的生活中，神不能引领我们前进。安乐的生活不能引领我们向上，只会带领我们向下。天总是在我们上面的，所以我们必须时时望着上面。许多人常常喜欢逃避那些要出代价、自制、克己、牺牲的事情，但是我告诉你们：祇有劳苦和困难是走向尊贵的惟一路径。伟大不是从一条为你开好的现成的青草路上来的，乃是从一条要你亲手去凿的道路来的。──选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5299.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
