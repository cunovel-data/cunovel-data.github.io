{"id":15010,"no":53,"title":"February 22","content":"\"If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\" (Mark 9:23)\\n\\n Seldom have we heard a better definition of faith than was given once in one of our meetings, by a dear old colored woman, as she answered the question of a young man how to take the Lord for needed help.\\n\\n In her characteristic way, pointing her finger toward him, she said with great emphasis: \"You\u0027ve just got to believe that He\u0027s done it and it\u0027s done.\" The great danger with most of us is that, after we ask Him to do it, we do not believe that it is done, but we keep on helping Him, and getting others to help Him; and waiting to see how He is going to do it.\\n\\n Faith adds its \"Amen\" to God\u0027s \"Yea,\" and then takes its hands off, and leaves God to finish His work. Its language is, \"Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him; and he worketh. \"(Ps.37:5)━Days of Heaven upon Earth\\n\\n \"I simply take Him at His word,\\n\\n I praise Him that my prayer is heard,\\n\\n And claim my answer from the Lord;\\n\\n I take, He undertakes.\"\\n\\n An active faith can give thanks for a promise, though it be not as yet performed; knowing that God\u0027s bonds are as good as ready money. ━Matthew Henry.\\n\\n Passive faith accepts the word as true━\\n\\n But never moves.\\n\\n Active faith begins the work to do,\\n\\n And thereby proves.\\n\\n Passive faith says, \"I believe it! every word of God is true. Well I know He hath not spoken what He cannot, will not, do. He hath bidden me, \u0027Go forward!\u0027 but a closed-up way I see, When the waters are divided, soon in Canaan\u0027s land I\u0027ll be. Lo! I hear His voice commanding, \u0027Rise and walk: take up thy bed\u0027;And, \u0027Stretch forth thy withered member!\u0027 which for so long has been dead. When I am a little stronger, then, I know I\u0027ll surely stand: When there comes a thrill of heating, I will use with ease my other hand. Yes, I know that \u0027God is able\u0027 and full willing all to do: I believe that every promise, sometime, will to me come true.\"\\n\\n Active faith says, \"I believe it! and the promise now I take, Knowing well, as I receive it, God, each promise, real will make. So I step into the waters, finding there an open way; Onward press, the land possessing; nothing can my progress stay. Yea, I rise at His commanding, walk straightway, and joyfully: This, my hand, so sadly shrivelled, as I reach, restored shall be. What beyond His faithful promise, would I wish or do I need? Looking not for \u0027signs or wonders,\u0027 I\u0027ll no contradiction heed. Well I know that \u0027God is able,\u0027 and full willing all to do: I believe that every promise, at this moment can come true.\"\\n\\n Passive faith but praises in the light,\\n\\n When sun doth shine.\\n\\n Active faith will praise in darkest night—\\n\\n Which faith is thine?\\n\\n ━Selected\\n\\n 二月二十二日\\n\\n 　“你若能信在信的人，凡事都能” （可九：23）\\n\\n 　　我们难得能听到信心准确的解释。有一次，我们聚会的时侯，一个青年人问起怎样可以从神那里得到需要的帮助；于是有一个亲爱的黑种老妇人站起来，伸出她的指头来指着那个青年人，很郑重地回答说：“你只要相信神已经作了，事情就成了。”这纔是信心准确的解释。多少时侯，我们最大的危险乃是：求了神之后，我们不相信神已经作了，我们倒设法去帮助祂，还请别人去帮助祂；然后看神怎样去作这件事。\\n\\n 　　真的信心，一经“阿门”神的“我肯”，就放手，让神独自去完成祂的工作。它的不二法门就是，“当将你的事交托耶和华，并依靠祂，祂就必成全”（诗三十七：5）。━译自地上的天上生活\\n\\n 神的话已经够我相信，\\n\\n 赞美神，祂已经听到我的祈祷，\\n\\n 祇求主给我一个回讯，\\n\\n 我不问祂的如何完成。\\n\\n 　　积极的信心，在得到了神的应许以后，立刻能发出赞美和感谢来，虽然应许还没有实践；因为祂知道神的支票和神的现款一样好。━亨利马太\\n\\n 消极的信心，接受了神的诺言，\\n\\n 并不照神的指示行动，\\n\\n 积极的信心，照神的旨意，\\n\\n 去进行，证实祂所赐的荣宠。\\n\\n 　　消极的信心说：“我相信，神的话句句都真。我知道祂的吩咐决没有不能或不愿帮助的成份，祂吩咐我“前进”，但我只见路途已遭封闭，还是等洪水分开再说，那时我会到达迦南福地了。我并且听见祂在命令：“起来，拿你的褥子回家去罢；”还有祂对久已枯萎的手臂说：“伸出你的枯手来”；只要等我身体强壮的时候，我就可以站起来了，等我霍然痊愈时，我的手也一定伸展自如了。我知道“神的万能”，掌有一切的权力，我相信，每个允许到了那时候都会给我应验。\\n\\n 　　积极的信心说：“我相信；现在我就接受祂的吩咐，我知道只要我接受，每个允许都会应验。因此我举步入水，就发现了前进的坦途，一直往前进入了美地；不为任何所阻挡。有了祂的吩咐，我立刻应命起身，忻然举步，我把手一伸，枯萎的残臂恢复健康。除了祂可靠的应许，我还有什么需求和愿望呢？我不期待奇迹或征兆，一点也不会滞延。我确知神的万能，掌有一切权力，我相信每个允许立刻能应验。”\\n\\n 消极的信心，\\n\\n 祇在光明环境中赞美深恩，\\n\\n 积极的信心，\\n\\n 最黑暗的境遇也会感激主恩，\\n\\n 你的信心何属？自己可细细的忖。\\n\\n ━选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4868.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
