{"id":14960,"no":3,"title":"January 3","content":"“I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure.” (Gen. 33:14) What a beautiful picture of Jacob’s thoughtfulness for the cattle and the children! He would not allow them to be overdriven even for one day. He would not lead on according to what a strong man like Esau could do and expected them to do, but only according to what they were able to endure. He knew exactly how far they could go in a day; and he made that his only consideration in arranging the marches. He had gone the same wilderness journey years before, and knew all about its roughness and heat and length, by personal experience. And so he said, “I will lead on softly.” (Gen. 33:14) “For ye have not passed this way heretofore” (Josh. 3:4). We have not passed this way heretofore, but the Lord Jesus has. It is all untrodden and unknown ground to us, but He knows it all by personal experience. The steep bits that take away our breath, the stony bits that make our feet ache so, the hot shadeless stretches that make us feel so exhausted, the rushing rivers that we have to pass through ━ Jesus has gone through it all before us. \"He was wearied with his journey.\" Not some, but all the many waters went over Him, and yet did not quench His love. He was made a perfect Leader by the things which He suffered. \"He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\" Think of that when you are tempted to question the gentleness of His leading. He is remembering all the time; and not one step will He make you take beyond what your foot is able to endure. Never mind if you think it will not be able for the step that seems to come next; either He will so strengthen it that it shall be able, or He will call a sudden halt, and you shall not have to take it at all. ━ Frances Ridley Havergal. In \"pastures green\"? Not always; sometimes He Who knowest best, in kindness leadeth me In weary ways, where heavy shadows be. So, whether on the hill-tops high and fair I dwell, or in the sunless valleys, where The shadows lie, what matter? He is there. ━ Barry 一月三日 “我要量着在我面前群畜和孩子的力量慢慢的前行。” （创三十三：14） 　　这真是一幅惟妙惟肖的图画，描写雅各布对群畜和孩子的慈心！他不愿意他们赶走一天的路程。他不愿意照粗人以扫的心意去催促他们。他乃是量着他们的力量慢慢地领他们前行。他知道他的儿女们年幼娇嫩，牛羊正在乳养的时候。他知道他们一天能行多少路；他考虑了然后才安排他们的行程。而且这条旷野的路程，以前他也曾走过；何处崎岖、何处凶险、何处炎热、何处寒冷，他都经历过。所以他对他们说：“我要慢慢地领你们前行。”“因为这条路你们向来没有走过。”（书三：4） 　　前面的路程我们也向来没有走过，可是主耶稣曾走过。我们的前途真是茫然无所知，可是主都经过。这一程使我们心慌意乱，那一程使我们筋疲力尽，另一程使我们干渴得舌贴牙床，又一程使我们喘不过气来━其实以前主都尝过、走过。经上说：“耶稣因走路困乏。”（约四：6）众水冲淹祂，却不能息灭祂的爱情。祂所经历的苦难使祂成为最好的牧者。“祂知道我们的本体，思念我们不过是尘土”（诗一零三：14）。祂每时每刻体恤我们；不让我们走一步过于我们力量的路。前面一程虽然有些难行，但是尽可放心；因为祂不是加力量使我们得以安然过去，定是吩咐我们突然止步。━海弗格尔 决非永远是葱绿的牧场， 有时全知全能的神祂指引我们 走过崎岖的道路，黑暗茫茫。 不论是山顶的鸟语花香， 不论是深谷的阴沈凄凉， 因为祂总在那里，我决不彷徨 ━巴雷","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4824.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
