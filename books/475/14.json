{"id":14971,"no":14,"title":"January 14","content":"\"He putteth forth his own sheep.\" (John 10:4) \n \n \"Oh, this is bitter work for Him and us ━ bitter for us to go, but equally bitter for Him to cause us pain; yet it must be done. It would not be conducive to our true welfare to stay always in one happy and comfortable lot. He therefore puts us forth. The fold is deserted, that the sheep may wander over the bracing mountain slope. The laborers must be thrust out into the harvest, else the golden grain would spoil. \n \n Take Heart! It could not be better to stay when He determines otherwise; and if the loving hand of our Lord puts us forth, it must be well. On, in His name, to green pastures and still waters and mountain heights! He goeth before thee. Whatever awaits us is encountered first by Him. Faith’s eye can always discern. His majestic presence in front; and when that cannot be seen, it is dangerous to move forward. Bind this comfort to your heart, that the Savior has tried for Himself all the experiences through which He asks you to pass; and He would not ask you to pass through them unless He was sure that they were not too difficult for your feet, or too trying for your strength. \n \n This is the Blessed life ━ not anxious to see far in front, nor careful about the next step, not eager to choose the path, nor weighted with the heavy responsibilities of the future, but quietly following behind the Shepherd, one step at a time. \n \n Dark is the sky! and veiled the unknown morrow ! \n \n Dark is life\u0027s way, for night is not yet o\u0027er; \n \n The longed-for glimpse I may not meanwhile borrow; \n \n But, this I know, HE GOETH ON BEFORE. \n \n Dangers are nigh! and fears my mind are shaking; \n \n Heart seems to dread what life may hold in store; \n \n But I am His ━ He knows the way I\u0027m taking, \n \n More blessed still ━ HE GOETH ON BEFORE. \n \n Doubts cast their weird, unwelcome shadows o\u0027er me, \n \n Doubts that life\u0027s best ━ life\u0027s choicest things are o\u0027er; \n \n What but His Word can strengthen, can restore me, \n \n And this blest fact; that still HE GOES BEFORE. \n \n HE GOES BEFORE! Be this my consolation! \n \n He goes before! On this my heart would dwell! \n \n He goes before! This guarantees salvation! \n \n HE GOES BEFORE! And therefore all is well. \n \n ━ Danson Smith \n \n The Oriental shepherd was always ahead of his sheep. He was down in front. Any attack upon them had to take him into account. Now God is down in front. He is in the tomorrows. It is tomorrow that fills men with dread. God is there already. All the tomorrows of our life have to pass Him before they can get to us. ━ F. B. M. \n \n “God is in every tomorrow, \n \n Therefore I live for today, \n \n Certain of finding at sunrise, \n \n Guidance and strength for the way; \n \n Power for each moment of weakness, \n \n Hope for each moment of pain, \n \n Comfort for every sorrow, \n \n Sunshine and joy after rain.\" \n \n 　 \n \n 一月十四日 \n \n 　　“他放出自己的羊” （约十：4） \n \n 　　主把自己的羊放出来。虽然羊走路很辛苦，然而必须如此。一直懒在一个又暖又舒适的羊圈中并不是真幸福。所以祂必须放羊出来，使牠们吃草喝水，呼吸新鲜的空气，欣赏美丽的风景。 \n \n 　　觉悟罢，让我们不再留恋原有的地罢！如果祂指挥我们出来，如果是我们的主亲手放我们出来的，一切决不会错误的。起来罢，奉祂的名，向着青草地和可安歇的水边开步罢！放胆罢，因为祂“在前头走”。无论甚么危险必须先经过祂。信心的眼睛能看见前面领路的好牧人；如果看不见了，自己再向前走去就危险了。安心罢，主叫我们走的路，祂自己都有过经历的；祂不会叫我们走一步我们不能走的路。 \n \n 　　这纔是一个有福的生命━不远看将来不罣虑前面一步，不自己选择路程，不把理想的重担压在背上，只是静静地一步一步紧跟着牧人。 \n \n 漫天漆黑，遮掩了未知的明天， \n \n 祇能暗中摸索，因为夜幕未收， \n \n 此刻或许得不到久盼的曙光， \n \n 但我知道，神走在我的前头 \n \n 危险卽在身旁，恐惧摇撼我的心， \n \n 生命前途，在在使我忧愁， \n \n 但我是属主的，祂知道我应走的路， \n \n 更幸运的是，祂走在我的前头。 \n \n 疑窦投下了不详的阴影， \n \n 担心人生佳境，已不复可求， \n \n 唯有祂的诺言使我坚强振奋， \n \n 最幸运的是，祂走在我的前头。 \n \n 祂走在前头，这是我的安慰， \n \n 祂走在前头，我心有了寄托， \n \n 祂走在前头，保证我的得救， \n \n 祂走在前头，一切必然顺利。 \n \n ━史密斯 \n \n 在东方的旷野中，牧童总是走在羊群前头的。有甚么危险的事情发生，必定先临到他，因为他在羊群前头。现在，神也在我们前头。祂在明天。明天顶会使我们挂虑，可是神已经在那边了。我们一生的明天，都必须先经过祂，然后纔临到我们。━梅尔 \n \n 每一个明天，都有神的领导， \n \n 因此今天尽可欢笑， \n \n 行路所需的指示与力量， \n \n 明天未爽，我就能找到； \n \n 祂给了我疲惫时的鼓励， \n \n 悲哀时所需的慰劳， \n \n 苦痛时所需的希望， \n \n 以及雨后开朗，阳光普照。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4835.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
