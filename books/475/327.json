{"id":15284,"no":327,"title":"November 23","content":"“Thou hast shewed thy people hard things” (Ps.60:3) I have always been glad that the Psalmist said to God that some things were hard. There is no mistake about it; there are hard things in life. Some beautiful pink flowers were given me this summer, and as I took them I said, \"What are they?\" And the answer came, \"They are rock flowers; they grow and bloom only on rocks where you can see no soil.\" Then I thought of God\u0027s flowers growing in hard places; and I feel, somehow, that He may have a peculiar tenderness for His \"rock flowers\" that He may not have for His lilies and roses. ━Margaret Bottome The tests of life are to make, not break us. Trouble may demolish a man\u0027s business but build up his character. The blow at the outward man may be the greatest blessing to the inner man. If God, then, puts or permits anything hard in our lives, be sure that the real peril, the real trouble, is what we shall lose if we flinch or rebel. ━Maltbie D. Babcock \"Neroes are forged on anvils hot with pain, And splendid courage comes but with the test, Some natures ripen and some natures bloom, Only on blood-wet soil,some souls prove great, Only in moments dark with death or doom.\" “God gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction.” 十一月二十三日 「祢叫祢的民遇见艰难。 」 （诗六十:3） 我很高兴的是诗篇作者对神说有些事是艰难的。这句话说得不错，生活中确实有许多艰难的事。今年夏天，有人送给我一些美丽的粉红色花，我问这是什么花，回答是：「这些是石花；石花只在你看不见泥土的岩石上生长开花。」于是我想到在艰难处生长的神的花；因此，不知怎么地，我感觉到神可能对其「石花」特别亲切，其亲切的程度可能是祂对其百合花和玫瑰花所没有的。━玛格丽特?博顿 人生的试验都是造就我们，不是破坏我们的。患难也许会拆毁我们的事业，可是能建立我们的品性。外面最大的打击，乃是里面最大的祝福。如果神允许艰难临到我们，那临到我们的危险、患难，定规都是于我们有益的；倘使我们退缩、叛逆，我们必会蒙到损失。━贝伯考克 英雄在痛苦的铁砧上成的, 唯有试炼才能培养无畏的勇气, 有些德性只在沾血的泥土上成熟开花, 有些灵魂只在危难时显出伟大和卓异。 神的精兵都是从苦难中得来的。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5562.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
