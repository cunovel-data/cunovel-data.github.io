{"id":15058,"no":101,"title":"April 11","content":"\"What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light.\" (Matt. 10:27)\\n\\n Our Lord is constantly taking us into the dark, that He may tell us things. Into the dark of the shadowed home, where bereavement has drawn the blinds; into the dark of the lonely, desolate life, where some infirmity closes us in from the light and stir of life; into the dark of some crushing sorrow and disappointment.\\n\\n Then He tells us His secrets, great and wonderful, eternal and infinite; He causes the eye which has become dazzled by the glare of earth to behold the heavenly constellations; and the car to detect the undertones of His voice, which is often drowned amid the tumult of earth\u0027s strident cries.\\n\\n But such revelations always imply a corresponding responsibility—\"that speak ye in the light--that proclaim upon the housetops.\"\\n\\n We are not meant to always linger in the dark, or stay in the closet; presently we shall be summoned to take our place in the rush and storm of life; and when that moment comes, we are to speak and proclaim what we have learned.\\n\\n This gives a new meaning to suffering, the saddest element in which is often its apparent aimlessness. \"How useless I am!\" \"What am I doing for the betterment of men?\" \"Wherefore this waste of the precious spikenard of my soul?\"\\n\\n Such are the desperate laments of the sufferer. But God has a purpose in it all. He has withdrawn His child to the higher altitudes of fellowship, that he may hear God speaking face to face, and bear the message to his fellows at the mountain foot.\\n\\n Were the forty days wasted that Moses spent on the Mount, or the period spent at Horeb by Elijah, or the years spent in Arabia by Paul?\\n\\n There is no short cut to the life of faith, which is the all-vital condition of a holy and victorious life. We must have periods of lonely meditation and fellowship with God. That our souls should have their mountains of fellowship, their valley of quiet rest beneath the shadow of a great rock, their nights beneath the stars, when darkness has veiled the material and silenced the stir of human life, and has opened the view of the infinite and eternal, is as indispensable as that our bodies should have food.\\n\\n Thus alone can the sense of God\u0027s presence become the fixed possession of the soul, enabling it to say repeatedly, with the Psalmist, \"Thou art near, O God.\" --F. B. Meyer.\\n\\n 四月十一日\\n\\n “我在暗中告诉你们的，你们要在明处说出来”（太十：27）。\\n\\n 　　我们的主常带我们到黑暗中去，为着要和我们说话。有时他带我们进入孤单的黑暗，有时他带我们进入忧伤的黑暗，有时他带我们进入失望的黑暗，有时他带我们进入疾病的黑暗。\\n\\n 　　然后他告诉我们他伟大的，神奇的，永远的，无限的奥秘；他开启我们迷糊的眼睛，叫我们看见属天的荣耀；他开通我们聋聩的耳朵，叫我们听见他的声音。在黑暗里我们能学到以前从来没有学到的功课。\\n\\n 　　可是我们得到了启示以后，就有一个责任——“你们要在明处说出来——要在屋顶上宣扬出来。”\\n\\n 　　我们并不会一直沉在黑暗中的；不久我们就要出来的；那时候我们就当把我们所学到的说出来，宣扬出来。\\n\\n 　　这样看来，我们受苦，并非是毫无意义，毫无目的的。许多时候，我们在受苦的时候会悲叹说：“我还有什么用处呢？我于人类有什么益处呢？我宝贵的一生就这样浪费了么 ”？我告诉你：神是有目的的。神要我们和他有最高的交通，神要我们能面对面听他说话，将信息带给在山脚下的人们。\\n\\n 　　摩西在西乃山，以利亚在何烈山，保罗在亚拉伯，岂都是白费时日呢？信心圣洁与得胜生活的必要条件，别无捷径可循，所以基督徒必须有单独默想，与神交通的时间。我们的灵，需要与至高者交通，也需要在岩石的阴影和夜晚的星光之下，静静安息。当黑暗遮蔽了尘世的烦嚣，也就展开了永恒与不朽的景象，这对于灵魂的需要，好象肉体之需要粮食毫无两样。\\n\\n 　　这样，我们才会时时觉得神的同在，能和大卫一同说：“耶和华啊，你与我相近”（诗一一九：151）。\\n\\n ——梅尔\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5037.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
