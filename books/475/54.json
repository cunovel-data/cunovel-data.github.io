{"id":15011,"no":54,"title":"February 23","content":"\"And there came a lion.\" (1 Sam. 17:34)\n It is a source of inspiration and strength to come in touch with the youthful David, trusting God. Through faith in God he conquered a lion and a bear, and afterwards overthrew the mighty Goliath. When that lion came to despoil that flock, it came as a wondrous opportunity to David. If he had failed or faltered he would have missed God\u0027s opportunity for him and probably would never have come to be God\u0027s chosen king of Israel. \"And there came a lion.\"\n One would not think that a lion was a special blessing from God; one would think that only an occasion of alarm. The lion was God\u0027s opportunity in disguise. Every difficulty that presents itself to us, if we receive it in the right way, is God\u0027s opportunity. Every temptation that comes is God\u0027s opportunity.\n When the \"lion\" comes, recognize it as God\u0027s opportunity no matter how rough the exterior. The very tabernacle of God was covered with badgers\u0027 skins and goats\u0027 hair; one would not think there would be any glory there. The Shekinah of God was manifest under that kind of covering. May God open our eyes to see Him, whether in temptations, trials, dangers, or misfortunes. ━C. H. P.\n 二月二十三日\n “有时来了狮子” （撒上十七：34）\n 　　读到年轻的戴维怎样信靠神，真能使我们得到鼓励和力量。藉着信心，他胜过狮子和熊，后来胜过大力的歌利亚。当狮子来攫夺羊羔的时侯，他看为一个非常的机会。若是他失败了，或者惊恐，逃跑了，他就失去了神所给他的机会，恐怕以后也会失去作神所拣选的以色列王的资格。\n 　　“有时来了狮子”。人从来不想狮子是从神那里来的一个特别的祝福；人总是把牠看为一件不幸的，受惊吓的事情。岂知这是神化装的祝福。每一次临到我们的苦难和试炼，若是我们用正当的方法接受，都是神给我们的机会和祝福。\n 　　当狮子来的时侯，不管牠外表如何可怕，你该认作这是神给你的机会。神的会幕外面是用公羊皮和海狗皮作顶盖的；人从来不想那里有神的荣耀。岂知耶和华的荣耀就在掩盖之中。但愿神开启我们的眼睛，叫我们无论在患难中，试炼中，危险中，不幸中，都能彀看见神。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4869.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
