{"id":15163,"no":206,"title":"July 25","content":"\"What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.\" (John 13:7.) \\n\\n WE have only a partial view here of God\u0027s dealings, His half-completed, half-developed plan; but all will stand out in fair and graceful proportions in the great finished Temple of Eternity! \\n\\n Go, in the reign of Israel\u0027s greatest king, to the heights of Lebanon. See that noble cedar, the pride of its compeers, an old wrestler with northern blasts! Summer loves to smile upon it, night spangle its feathery foliage with dewdrops, the birds nestle on its branches, the weary pilgrim or wandering shepherd reposes under its shadows from the midday heat or from the furious storm; but all at once it is marked out to fall; The aged denizen of the forest is doomed to succumb to the woodman\u0027s stroke! \\n\\n As we see the axe making its first gash on its gnarled trunk, then the noble limbs stripped of their branches, and at last the \"Tree of God,\" as was its distinctive epithet, coming with a crash to the ground, we exclaim against the wanton destruction, the demolition of this proud pillar in the temple of nature. We are tempted to cry with the prophet, as if inviting the sympathy of every lowlier stem-invoking inanimate things to resent the affront- \"Howl, fir tree; for the cedar has fallen!\" (Zech.11:2)\\n\\n But wait a little. Follow that gigantic trunk as the workmen of Hiram launch it down the mountain side; thence conveyed in rafts along the blue waters of the Mediterranean; and last of all, behold it set a glorious polished beam in the Temple of God. As you see its destination, placed in the very Holy of Holies, in the diadem of the Great King-say, can you grudge that \"the crown of Lebanon\" was despoiled, in order that this jewel might have so noble a setting? \\n\\n That cedar stood as a stately prop in Nature\u0027s sanctuary, but \"the glory of the latter house was greater than the glory of the former!\" (Hag.2:9)\\n\\n How many of our souls are like these cedars of old! God\u0027s axes of trial have stripped and bared them. We see no reason for dealings so dark and mysterious, but He has a noble end and object in view; to set them as everlasting pillars and rafters in His Heavenly Zion; to make them a \"crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of our God.\"(Isa,62:3) --- J.R.Macduff. \\n\\n \"I do not ask my cross to understand.\\n\\n My way to see-\\n\\n Better in darkness just to feel Thy hand,\\n\\n And follow Thee.\" \\n\\n 七月二十五日\\n\\n 「我所作的，你如今不知道，后来必明白。」（约十三: 7） \\n\\n 　　我们现在所看见的神的作为，只是局部的━一个半完成、半发展的计划；到永生的殿完成的时候，全部工程就要清清楚楚地显露出来！ \\n\\n 　　让我们上利巴嫩山顶去看看。在那里有高大的香柏树，它是同辈的光荣，狂风的对手！夏喜欢对着它微笑；夜喜欢用露珠镶饰它的叶子；飞鸟喜欢巢居在它的枝干上；疲倦的旅客、流浪的牧童都喜欢在它的荫下憩息━躲避日中的炎热、狂暴的风雨。虽然这样，有一天，它却被砍倒了；多年在林中享有权利的香柏树，竟死在樵夫手下！ \\n\\n 　　当斧子砍下去的时候，树枝都从树身上脱下来了，那株高大的香柏树，哗啦一声，倒在地上了。那时候，我们禁不住和先知一般喊叫说：「松树阿，应当哀号。因为香柏树倾倒了！」（撒迦利亚书十一章 2 节） \\n\\n 　　但是等一等。让我们跟着希兰的工人将那株大树运下山来：从那里沿着蓝色的地中海漂去；看啊，这株香柏树最后成了神殿中的栋梁━一根荣耀光泽的栋梁。当你看见了它的结局━被安置在圣殿的至圣所里、万王之王的宫殿里━你会不会再可惜利巴嫩的香柏树被砍倒了呢？ \\n\\n 　　「这殿后来的荣耀，必大过先前的荣耀。」（哈该书二章 9 节） \\n\\n 多少时候，我们正像那香柏树林!神的斧子将我们剥夺得一无所有。我们看不出有甚么理由叫我们遇见这样神秘的对付，但是神自有祂的目的在:神预备永远用我们来作天上的楝梁，叫我们「在耶和华的手中要作为华冠,在你神的掌上必作为冕旒。? ━ 马克特夫\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5276.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
