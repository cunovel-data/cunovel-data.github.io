{"id":15282,"no":325,"title":"November 21","content":"“Roll on Jehovah thy way” (Ps. 37:5, margin) Whatever it is that presses thee, go tell the Father; put the whole matter over into His hand, and so shalt thou be freed from that dividing, perplexing care that the world is full of. When thou art either to do or suffer anything, when thou art about any purpose or business, go tell God of it, and acquaint Him with it; yes, burden Him with it, and thou hast done for matter of caring; no more care, but quiet, sweet, diligence in thy duty, and dependence on Him for the carriage of thy matters. Roll thy cares, and thyself with them, as one burden, all on thy God. ━R. Leighton We shall find it impossible to commit our way unto the Lord, unless it be a way that He approves. It is only by faith that a man can commit his way unto the Lord; if there be the slightest doubt in the heart that \"our way\" is not a good one, faith will refuse to have anything to do with it. This committing of our way must be a continuous, not a single act. However extraordinary and unexpected may seem to be His guidance, however near the precipice He may take you, you are not to snatch the guiding reins out of His hands. Are we willing to have all our ways submitted to God, for Him to pronounce judgment on them? There is nothing a Christian needs to be more scrutinizing about than about his confirmed habits and views. He is too apt to take for granted the Divine approbation of them. Why are some Christians so anxious, so fearful? Evidently because they have not left their way with the Lord. They took it to Him, but brought it away with them again. ━Selected Build a little fence of trust, Around today; Fill the space of loving work, And therein stay. Look not through the sheltering bars, Upon tomorrow; God will help thee bear what comes, Of joy or sorrow. ━Mary Butts 十一月二十一日 「当将你的事交托耶和华。」 （诗卅七:5） 压逼你的无论是甚么，你只要把它们完完全全交在父神的手里；这样，你就不会有甚么挂虑了。甚么时候，你预备做一件事，你就先去告诉祂，把重担加在祂身上；然后你就安安静静、快快乐乐、勤勤勉勉地去尽你前面的本分，专心仰赖神替你成就。信徒阿，把你一切挂虑，和你自己，捆成一捆，辊到神身上去罢！━雷登 我们如果没有信心，「把我们的事交托主」是一件不可能的事。无论主的引导多么异常，无论主带领你走上多么陡峭的绝壁，只要你没有放松你手里的缰绳，是绝对没有危险的。我们到底愿不愿意把我们一切的事交托神，让祂去宣判呢？这是要每一个基督人自己决定的。为甚么许多基督人这样不安、这样胆怯呢？很明显的是因为他们没有把他们的事交托主。他们把他们的事带到主那里去，又把它们带了回来。━选 筑起一条虔诚的篱, 围绕着今天, 你住在篱里面, 以爱的工作填满空间。 不要从篱落缝中, 去探望明天, 神会帮助你承受未来的? 欢乐或苦难的熬煎。 ━柏特士","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5560.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
