The top-most place of power is always bought with blood. You may have the pinnacles if you have enough blood to pay. That is the conquest condition of the holy heights everywhere. The story of real heroisms is the story of sacrificial blood. The chiefest values in life and character are not blown across our way by vagrant winds. Great souls have great sorrows.\\n\\n “Geat truths are dearly bought, the common truths,\\n\\n Such as men give and take from day to day,\\n\\n Come in the common walk of easy life,\\n\\n Blown by the careless wind across our way. ”\\n\\n “Great truths are greatly won, not found by chance,\\n\\n Nor wafted on the breath of summer dream;\\n\\n But grasped in the great struggle of the soul,\\n\\n Hard buffeting with adverse wind and stream.”\\n\\n “But in the day of conflict, fear and grief,\\n\\n When the strong hand of God, put forth in might,\\n\\n Plows up the subsoil of the stagnant heart,\\n\\n And brings the imprisoned truth seed to the light.”\\n\\n “Wrung from the troubled spirit, in hard hours,\\n\\n Of weakness, solitude, perchance of pain,\\n\\n Truth springs like harvest from the well-plowedfield,\\n\\n And the soul feels it has not wept in vain.”\\n\\n The capacity for knowing God enlarges as we are brought by Him into circumstances which oblige us to exercise faith; so, when difficulties beset our path let us thank God that He is taking trouble with us, and lean hard upon Him. ━Selected\\n\\n 十一月三日\\n\\n 「在一切净光的高处必有他们的牧场。」（赛四十九:9，直译）\\n\\n 小玩意儿很容易到手,但是贵重的东西却须要花费巨大的代价。 能力的最高处是用血买来的。只要你有血可付，你尽可得到顶巅的能力。英雄的故事都是流血的故事。人生最有价值的东西，都不是偶然被风吹来的。\\n\\n 伟大的真理,要以高价换来,\\n\\n 不像平凡事物得之甚易,\\n\\n 在日常生活中到处可遇,\\n\\n 随风飘到我们的面前。\\n\\n 伟大的胜利,得之非易，\\n\\n 它不会在酣梦中来到，\\n\\n 灵魂在和逆境苦斗时，\\n\\n 才能把握它的奥秘。\\n\\n 或是在忧伤烦恼的日子，\\n\\n 那时神伸出强力的手指，\\n\\n 松我沉滞的心底泥土，\\n\\n 挑起了埋藏的胜利种子。\\n\\n 在软弱孤寂痛苦之时候，\\n\\n 被折磨的心在扭绞中挤出真理，\\n\\n 好像辛勤的耕耘,产生了收获，\\n\\n 这样何尝白费了血泪洗礼。\\n\\n 我们的环境越难，我们认识神的能力越大；所以，当困难围困我们的时候，让我们一方面感谢神，一方面紧紧偎依祂。━选\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5542.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
