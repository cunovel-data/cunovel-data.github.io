While I was thus pleading, I opened my eyes and saw a framed illuminated text, which my mother had given me only a few days before, and which I had told my servant to place upon the wall during my absence at the holiday resort where my little one was taken away from us. \\n\\n I did not notice the words on returning to my house; but as I looked up and wiped my eyes, the words met my gaze, \"My grace is sufficient for thee.\" \\n\\n The \"is\" was picked out in bright green while the \"My\" and the \"thee\" were painted in another color. \\n\\n In one moment the message came straight to my soul, as a rebuke for offering such a prayer as, \"Lord, let Thy grace be sufficient for me\"; for the answer was almost as an audible voice, \"How dare you ask that which is?\" God cannot make it any more sufficient than He has made it; get up and believe it, and you will find it true, because the Lord says it in the simplest way: \"My grace is (not shall be or may be) sufficient for thee.\" \\n\\n \"My,\" \"is,\" and \"thee\" were from that moment, I hope, indelibly fixed upon my heart; and I (thank God) have been trying to live in the reality of the message from that day forward to the present time. \\n\\n The lesson that came to me, and which I seek to convey to others, is, Never turn God\u0027s facts into hopes, or prayers, but simply use them as realities, and you will find them powerful as you believe them.--Prebendary H. W. Webb Peploe \\n\\n He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,\\n\\n He sendeth more strength when the labors increase;\\n\\n To added affliction He addeth His mercies,\\n\\n To multiplied trials His multiplied peace.\\n\\n When we have exhausted our store of endurance,\\n\\n When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,\\n\\n When we reach the end of our hoarded resources\\n\\n Our Father\u0027s full giving is only begun.\\n\\n His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,\\n\\n His power no boundary known unto men;\\n\\n For out of His infinite riches in Jesus\\n\\n He giveth and giveth and giveth again.\\n\\n -Annie Johnson Flint\\n\\n 八月五日\\n\\n 「我的恩典是彀你用的。」（林后十二9） \\n\\n 神乐意在我受特殊试炼和痛苦的环境下，将我最小的孩子取去；当我将孩子安放在坟墓里，回到家中以后，我觉得我应该对弟兄姊妹们宣讲一些试炼的意义。\\n\\n 我就选择这个题目来作主日的信息；但是在我预备资料的时候，我发现我所要讲的，连我自己也不能相信；我就跪下来求神给我够用的恩典。我这样恳求了之后，张开眼睛来看见一幅彩色的经文━这幅经文是前几天，我陪着孩子在游息所的时候，我的母亲送到家中来的；我虽然未曾看见过，却曾听见过我的仆人这样告诉我，我也曾吩咐我的仆人将它挂在墙上。 \\n\\n 在我回家以后，我未曾去注意上面的字句；这时候，我仰起面来，拭干了眼睛，幅上的字句吸引了我的注意：「我的恩典是够你用的。」 \\n\\n 「是」字是鲜绿色的，「我的」和「你」是另一种颜色。\\n\\n 这个信息立即进入了我的心内，责备我不该求神给我够用的恩典；因为神已经很清楚地告诉了我：「我的恩典是彀你用的，你怎么还来要求？只要起来相信，你就要发现这句话是多眞实！」神已经用最简易的字句告诉我们：「我的恩典是（不是将要或者也许）够你用的。」\\n\\n 从那时候起，「我的」，「是」，「你」，都深深地刻上了我的心版；感谢神，从那天起，直到现在，我天天活在这个信息的实现中。\\n\\n 这次我所得到的功课，眞愿意别人也得到：总当将神的事实看为事实，千万不要将事实当作希望、恳求；甚么时候你相信一个事实，你就会发现这个事实是有能力的。──韦迫伯鲁\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5301.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
