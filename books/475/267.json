{"id":15224,"no":267,"title":"September 24","content":"\"After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithyma: but the Spirit suffered them not\" (Acts 16:7).\n What a strange prohibition! These men were going into Bithynia just to do Christ\u0027s work, and the door is shut against them by Christ\u0027s own Spirit. I, too, have experienced this in certain moments. I have sometimes found myself interrupted in what seemed to me a career of usefulness. Opposition came and forced me to go back, or sickness came and compelled me to retire into a desert apart. \n It was hard at such times to leave my work undone when I believed that work to be the service of the Spirit. But I came to remember that the Spirit has not only a service of work, but a service of waiting. I came to see that in the Kingdom of Christ there are not only times for action, but times in which to forbear acting. I came to learn that the desert place apart is often the most useful spot in the varied life of man--more rich in harvest than the seasons in which the corn and wine abounded. I have been taught to thank the blessed Spirit that many a darling Bithynia had to be left unvisited by me. \n And so, Thou Divine Spirit, would I still be led by Thee. Still there come to me disappointed prospects of usefulness. Today the door seems to open into life and work for Thee; tomorrow it closes before me just as I am about to enter. \n Teach me to see another door in the very inaction of the hour. Help me to find in the very prohibition thus to serve Thee, a new opening into Thy service. Inspire me with the knowledge that a man may at times be called to do his duty by doing nothing, to work by keeping still, to serve by waiting. When I remember the power of the \"still small voice,\" I shall not murmur that sometimes the Spirit suffers me not to go. --George Matheson \n “ When I cannot understand my father’s leading, And it seems to be but hard and cruel fate, Still I hear that gentle whisper ever pleading, God is working, God is faithful, ONLY WAIT. \" \n 九月二十四日 \n 「到了每西亚的边界，他们想要往庇推尼去，耶稣的灵却不许。」（徒十六7）\n 这是一个多么奇怪的禁止！这些人想要往庇推尼去，目的是为作主的工，但是主自几反把工作的门关了起来。我自己也曾有这样的经历。有时候，我自以为成功的路径，反受到了许多拦阻。反对起来摧逼我回去，疾病进来强迫我退到荒野去。\n 有时工作尚未做完圣灵要我把它放下，这实在是非常困难的事。但是神给我看见：工作是事奉神，等候也是事奉神。要我活动的是神，禁止我活动的是神。感谢神，我现在知道多少时候荒野原是最有益的地方。我感谢神，许多我所爱去的庇推尼，我都没有去。\n 圣灵阿，虽然我的前途常遭挫折，我仍然愿意拣选祢的引导。今天工作的门似乎开了，明天当我正要进去的时候又忽然关了，这都是祢的事情。 \n 求祢教导我在等候中看见前面的路径。求祢教导我在禁止中寻见事奉祢的新路。求祢教导我在不作工的时候尽忠━用安静来作工，用等候来事奉。－－马德胜\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5415.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
