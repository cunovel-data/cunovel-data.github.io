{"id":15149,"no":192,"title":"July 11","content":"\"It came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.\" (1 Kings 17:7)\\n\\n WEEK after week, with unfaltering and steadfast spirit, Elijah watched that dwindling brook; often tempted to stag-ger through unbelief, but refusing to allow his circumstances to come between himself and God.\\n\\n Unbelief sees God through circumstances, as we sometimes see the sun shorn of his rays through smoky air; but faith puts God between itself and circumstances, and looks at them through Him. \\n\\n And so the dwindling brook became a silver thread; and the silver thread stood presently in pools at the foot of the largest boulders; and the pools shrank. The birds fled; the wild creatures of field and forest came no more to drink; the brook was dry. Only then to his patient and unwavering spirit, \"the word of the Lord came, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath.\"(1 Kings17:8-9) \\n\\n Most of us would have gotten anxious and worn with planning long before that. We should have ceased our songs as soon as the streamlet caroled less musically over its rocky bed; and with harps swinging on the willows, we should have paced to and fro upon the withering grass, lost in pensive thought. And probably, long ere the brook was dry, we should have devised some plan, and asking God\u0027s blessing on it, would have started off elsewhere. \\n\\n God often does extricate us, because His mercy endureth forever; but if we had only waited first to see the unfolding of His plans, we should never found ourselves landed in such an inextricable labyrinth; and we should never have been compelled to retrace our steps with so many tears of shame. Wait, patiently wait! --- F. B. Meyer. 　\\n\\n 七月十一日\\n\\n 「过了些日子，溪水就干了，因为雨没有下在地上。」（王上十七:7）\\n\\n 　　一星期一星期地过去，伊莱贾带着坚忍不挠的精神，守着那日渐干涸的溪水；撒但常常诱惑他叫他发生疑惧，但是他始终不允许环境来插在他与神的中间。 \\n\\n 　　我们有时常会藉环境来看神，正像在烟雾中看太阳，觉得太阳的光辉减少了一样；但是信心是将神放在环境和自己中间的━用神的看法来看环境的。 \\n\\n 　　一天天地过去，那日渐干涸的溪水只剩下了一条银色的细线了；银色的细线不久又断成了小小的池沼；池沼又渐渐干涸。 飞鸟逃去了；田间和林中的野兽也不再来取饮了；到了一天，溪水全然干涸了。伊莱贾忍耐坚持到那时候，才有「耶和华的话临到他， 说，你起身往西顿的撒勒法去……」（列王纪上十七章 8-9 节）。 \\n\\n 　　如果是我们，一定早已急坏了━早在东打算西打算地妄用自己的聪明了。当水流潺潺的声音稍为减少了一些的时候， 我们感谢赞美的歌声可能早就停止了；我们会将歌颂神的乐器丢在柳树枝上，自己却在枯黄的草地上踏来踏去，焦虑得像失去了魂一般。 或许，在溪水干涸以前，我们早会想出些方法来求神祝福，然后出发往他处去了。 \\n\\n 　　神常常按照祂自己的时候来解救我们，因为祂的慈爱是永远常存的；我们如果肯先等候看明神的旨意，我们便不会流落到不及解救的地步， 我们也不会带着羞愧的泪眼走回头路了。所以读者阿，我们应当等候，耐心等候神的旨意向我们显明！── 梅尔\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5262.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
