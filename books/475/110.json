{"id":15067,"no":110,"title":"April 20","content":"\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.\" (Zech. 4:6) My way led up a hill, and right at the foot I saw a boy on a bicycle. He was pedalling up hill against the wind, and evidently found it a tremendously hard work. Just as he was working most strenuously and doing his best painfully, there came a trolley car going in the same direction--up the hill. It was not going too fast for the boy to get behind it, and with one hand to lay hold of the bar at the back. Then you know what happened. He went up that hill like a bird. Then it flashed upon me: \"Why, I am like that boy on the bicycle in my weariness and weakness. I am pedalling up hill against all kinds of opposition, and am almost worn out with the task. But here at hand is a great available power, the strength of the Lord Jesus. \"I have only to get in touch with Him and to maintain communication with Him, though it may be only one little finger of faith, and that will be enough to make His power mine for the doing of this bit of service that just now seems too much for me.\" And I was helped to dismiss my weariness and to realize this truth. --The Life of Fuller Purpose. ABANDONED Utterly abandoned to the Holy Ghost! Seeking all His fulness at whatever cost; Cutting all the shore-lines, launching in the deep Of His mighty power--strong to save and keep. Utterly abandoned to the Holy Ghost! Oh! the sinking, sinking, until self is lost! Until the emptied vessel lies broken at His feet; Waiting till His filling shall make the work complete. Utterly abandoned to the will of God; Seeking for no other path than my Master trod; Leaving ease and pleasure, making Him my choice, Waiting for His guidance, listening for His voice. Utterly abandoned! no will of my own; For time and for eternity, His, and His alone; All my plans and purposes lost in His sweet will, Having nothing, yet in Him all things possessing still. Utterly abandoned! \u0027tis so sweet to be Captive in His bonds of love, yet so wondrous free; Free from sin\u0027s entanglements, free from doubt and fear, Free from every worry, burden, grief or care. Utterly abandoned! oh, the rest is sweet, As I tarry, waiting, at His blessed feet; Waiting for the coming of the Guest divine, Who my inmost being shall perfectly refine. Lo! He comes and fills me, Holy Spirit sweet! I, in Him, am satisfied! I, in Him, complete! And the light within my soul shall nevermore grow dim While I keep my covenant--abandoned unto Him! --Author Unknown. 　 四月二十日 “万军之耶和华说，不是倚靠势力，不是倚靠才能，乃是倚靠我的灵，方能成事”（亚四：6）。 　　有一次我在山脚下散步，看见一个小孩骑着自行车上山去。路又斜，风又紧，那孩子用尽了力气，却仍向前不得。他正感力竭的时侯，恰巧一辆无轨电车经过，向着山顶驶去。 　　那孩子赶紧伸手抓住车后的一根横梗。他一点力气都不用花，似飞一般地上了山顶。此时我就发生了一个感想： 　　“我现在这样疲乏，软弱，正像自行车上的孩子一般。我尽力向上而行，可是多少困难，拦阻，接踵而来，使我筋疲力尽。但是在这里有一个力量——主耶稣无限的力量——可以给我使用。 　　我只需与他接触，与他交通，虽然仅有信心的一个小指头钩住他，也已经足够叫他的力量给我使用，来应付一切我所不能胜任的事情了”。 　　这一次，我不只得了一个属灵的教训，也把我一身的重压抛去了。——译自更完美的生命 放弃一切，依靠圣灵！ 求其成全，不惜任何牺牲； 舍弃海岸，投入他全能无边的大洋， 他是指引你得救和生存的明灯。 放弃一切，依靠圣灵！ 深深地浸润，直到无我之境； 躺在他脚下承受他来充满， 像一只空虚的器皿。 放弃一切，尊从神的意旨， 以他的路径为路径，专志一心； 放弃安乐，以他为我的选择， 听他命令，等待他的指正。 放弃一切，不再有自己的主张， 从今而后永远照他旨意； 打消一切计划，自己一无所有， 却从神那里获得一切富足。 放弃一切，受他爱的束缚， 这是多么自由而舒服； 解脱罪恶怀疑和恐惧的纠缠， 释放一切忧虑悲痛的桎梏。 放弃一切，滞留在他的脚下等待， 何等的气爽神清； 等待神给我锻炼， 净化我的心灵。 看哪！圣灵充满我的内心， 我感到丰满和全备， 只要坚守誓约，放弃一切依靠主！ 我的心哪！光明永放，不绝绵绵。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5046.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
