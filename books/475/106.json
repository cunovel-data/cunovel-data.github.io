{"id":15063,"no":106,"title":"April 16","content":"\"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed.\" (Heb. 11:8) Whither he went, he knew not; it was enough for him to know that he went with God. He leant not so much upon the promises as upon the Promiser. He looked not on the difficulties of his lot, but on the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, who had deigned to appoint his course, and would certainly vindicate Himself. O glorious faith! This is thy work, these are thy possibilities; contentment to sail with sealed orders, because of unwavering confidence in the wisdom of the Lord High Admiral; willinghood to rise up, leave all, and follow Christ, because of the glad assurance that earth\u0027s best cannot bear comparison with Heaven\u0027s least. --F. B. M. It is by no means enough to set out cheerfully with your God on any venture of faith. Tear into smallest pieces any itinerary for the journey which your imagination may have drawn up. Nothing will fall out as you expect. Your guide will keep to no beaten path. He will lead you by a way such as you never dreamed your eyes would look upon. He knows no fear, and He expects you to fear nothing while He is with you. The day had gone; alone and weak I groped my way within a bleak And sunless land. The path that led into the light I could not find! In that dark night God took my hand. He led me that I might not stray, And brought me by a new, safe way I had not known. By waters still, through pastures green I followed Him--the path was clean Of briar and stone. The heavy darkness lost its strength, My waiting eyes beheld at length The streaking dawn. On, safely on, through sunrise glow I walked, my hand in His, and lo, The night had gone. --Annie Porter Johnson. 　 四月十六日 “亚伯拉罕因着信，蒙召的时候，就遵命出去往将来要得为业的地方去”（来十一：8）。 　　他往哪里去，他不知道；他只知道神和他同去，这就够他放心了。他对于所得的应许，虽然不顶清楚，但是他对于赐应许的应许者，已够清楚了。他不看前面的难处，只看那全能，全智，公义，信实，永远活着的神。这样的一位神既安排了他的路程，当然不会和他儿戏的。哦，这是荣耀的信心！你也可以作得到的。当他打发你出去的时候，虽然路线还未显明，但是你尽可信任那打发者——天地之主，宇宙之神。起来吧，放下自己的一切，跟从主，因为地上顶好的还不堪与天上顶坏的一比。——梅尔 　　光是欢欢喜喜地和主一同出发冒信心的险，还不足够；还当把你自己所计划的路程表撕得粉碎。 　　没有一件事会照你所意料的实现。 　　你的向导知道怎样引领你前进。他将领你走一条你所梦想不到的路径。他不知道惧怕，他也希望你因着他的同在不知惧怕。——选 白天已去，我孤单困疲， 在阴暗中摸索路径， 我问：何处是光明？ 神握着我的手前进。 他引导我，免我走入歧途， 这是陌生安全的新路， 经过了幽静的溪流与绿野， 没有石砾和荆棘阻我脚步。 黑暗失去了原有的力量， 终于盼望到一线曙光， 他握着我平安前进， 朝晖渐现，黑夜已遁。 ——强逊","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5042.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
