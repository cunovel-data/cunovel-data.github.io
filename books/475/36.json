{"id":14993,"no":36,"title":"February 5","content":"\"Ye shall not go out with haste.\" (Isa. 52:12)\n I do not believe that we have begun to understand the marvelous power there is in stillness. We are in such a hurry━we must be doing━so that we are in danger of not giving God a chance to work. You may depend upon it, God never says to us, \"Stand still,\"(Ex.14:13) or \"Sit still,\"(Lk.3:18) or \"Be still,\"(MK.4:39) unless He is going to do something.\n This is our trouble in regard to our Christian life; we want to do something to be Christians when we need to let Him work in us. Do you know how still you have to be when your likeness is being taken?\n Now God has one eternal purpose concerning us, and that is that we should be like His Son; and in order that this may be so, we must be passive. We hear so much about activity, may be we need to know what it is to be quiet. ━Crumbs\n Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!\n Nor deem these days━these waiting days━as ill!\n The One who loves thee best, who plans thy way,\n Hath not forgotten thy great need today!\n And, if He waits, \u0027tis sure He waits to prove\n To thee, His tender child, His heart\u0027s deep love.\n Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!\n Thou longest much to know thy dear Lord\u0027s will!\n While anxious thoughts would almost steal their way\n Corrodingly within, because of His delay━\n Persuade thyself in simple faith to rest\n That He, who knows and loves, will do the best.\n Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!\n Nor move one step, not even one, until\n His way hath opened. Then, ah then, how sweet!\n How glad thy heart, and then how swift thy feet\n Thy inner being then, ah then, how strong!\n And waiting days not counted then too long.\n Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!\n What higher service could\u0027st thou for Him fill?\n \u0027Tis hard! ah yes! But choicest things must cost!\n For lack of losing all how much is lost!\n \u0027Tis hard, \u0027tis true! But then━He giveth grace\n To count the hardest spot the sweetest place.\n ━J. D.
