{"id":15116,"no":159,"title":"June 8","content":"\"For every child of God overcomes the world: and the victorious principle which has overcome the world is our faith.\" (1 John 5:4) (Weymouth) At every turn in the road one can find something that will rob him of his victory and peace of mind, if he permits it. Satan is a long way from having retired from the business of deluding and ruining God\u0027s children if he can. At every milestone it is well to look carefully to the thermometer of one\u0027s experience, to see whether the temperature is well up. Sometimes a person can, if he will, actually snatch victory from the very jaws of defeat, if he will resolutely put his faith up at just the right moment. Faith can change any situation. No matter how dark it is, no matter what the trouble may be, a quick lifting of the heart to God in a moment of real, actual faith in Him, will alter the situation in a moment. God is still on His throne, and He can turn defeat into victory in a second of time, if we really trust Him. \"When one has faith, one does not retire; one stops the enemy where he finds him.\" --Marshal Foch. 　 六月八日 “因为凡从神生的，就胜过世界。使我们胜了世界的，就是我们的信心”（约壹五：4）。 　　在基督徒的路程中，每一处都有网罗和陷阱，使他跌倒，堕落，失去胜利，失去平安。撒但从不肯告退，放弃他攻击，诱惑，毁灭神儿女的事业的。所以，我们该在途中随时检查自己有否失去得胜。 　　有时我们能，若是我们愿意，在狮子的口中反败为胜，如果我们在千钧一发之际运用信心。 　　信心能造时势，改环境。无论如何黑，无论如何凶危，只要用信心和神作一敏捷的联合，胜败立刻因之一变。 　　神始终在他的宝座上，他能在一秒钟之内转败为胜，如果我们真信靠他。 　　一个有信心的人，从不向后退的；他在遇见仇敌的地方，立刻阻拦仇敌前进。——福煦","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5162.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
