{"id":15141,"no":184,"title":"July 3","content":"\"Doth the plowman plow all day to sow?\"(Isa. 28:24)\\n\\n One day in early summer I walked past a beautiful meadow. The grass was as soft and thick and fine as an immense green Oriental rug. In one corner stood a fine old tree, a sanctuary for numberless wild birds; the crisp, sweet air was full of their happy songs. Two cows lay in the shade, the very picture of content.Down by the roadside the saucy dandelion mingled his gold with the royal purple of the wild violet.\\n\\n I leaned against the fence for a long time, feasting my hungry eyes, and thinking in my soul that God never made a fairer spot than my lovely meadow.\\n\\n The next day I passed that way again, and lo! the hand of the despoiler had been there. A plowman and his great plow, now standing idle in the furrow, had in a day wrought a terrible havoc. Instead of the green grass there was turned up to view the ugly, bare, brown earth; instead of the singing birds there were only a few hens industriously scratching for worms. Gone were the dandelion and the pretty violet. I said in my grief, \"How could any one spoil a thing so fair?\"\\n\\n Then my eyes were opened by some unseen hand, and I saw a vision, a vision of a field of ripe corn ready for the harvest. I could see the giant, heavily laden stalks in the autumn sun; I could almost hear the music of the wind as it would sweep across the golden tassels. And before I was aware, the brown earth took on a splendor it had not had the day before.\\n\\n Oh, that we might always catch the vision of an abundant harvest, when the great Master Plowman comes, as He often does, and furrows through our very souls, uprooting and turning under that which we thought most fair, and leaving for our tortured gaze only the bare and the unbeautiful. ━Selected\\n\\n Why should I start at the plough of my Lord, that maketh the deep furrows on my soul? I know He is no idle husbandman, He purposeth a crop. ━Samuel Rutherford \\n\\n 七月三日\\n\\n “那耕地为要撒种的岂是常常耕地呢？”（赛廿八：24）\\n\\n 一天初夏，我走过一块美丽的草场。上面的青草非常柔软，浓厚，纯粹，真像一块东方的绿色大地毯。草场的一隅栽着一棵佳美的古树，树上停着无数美丽的野鸟；晴爽的空中充满了牠们悦耳的歌声。两只母牛躺卧在凉爽的树荫下，表现出洋洋得意的样子来。路旁种着黄色的蒲公英，蒲公英中间，又夹着紫色的紫罗兰。\\n\\n 我倚着竹篱呆望了好久，尽量饱享了一顿眼福，心中想着：神所造的宇宙中，没有一处能比这里更美丽更可爱了。\\n\\n 第二天我又走过那条路，看啊！那幅美丽的图画全被拆毁了。一个农夫扶着铁犁，站在畦间，在一天之内造成了这一个大破坏！绿色的青草没有了，留着的祇是一片丑陋，光秃的黄土；歌唱的野鸟不见了，却换来了几只抓土啄虫的老母鸡。路旁的蒲公英，美丽的紫罗兰，一概都不见了。我忧忧愁愁地自语道：“这样美丽的东西，也有人忍心损害吗？”\\n\\n 那时全能者的手打开了我的眼睛，叫我看见已熟的禾稼等待人去收割。我能彀看见巨大迟笨的草人巍立在日光之下；我能彀听见秋风掠过麦穗的响声。那时我就觉悟到：若不经过那块丑陋光秃的黄土，就得不到收割禾稼的光荣。\\n\\n 亲爱的读者，我们的神是我们心田的农夫，祂常常来耕垦我们的心田，将我们自以为最美丽的东西拔去，留给们一个光秃秃不美丽的光景；我们应当忍着暂时的痛楚，仰望前面收获的丰富。━选\\n\\n 我们为什么要对主的犁头惊诧呢？祂深深耕耘着我们的灵魂？我知道祂不是无目的农夫，祂瞻望着丰富的收获。━陆瑟福\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5254.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
