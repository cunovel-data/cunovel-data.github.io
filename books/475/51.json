{"id":15008,"no":51,"title":"February 20","content":"\"Nothing shall be impossible unto you.\" (Matt. 17:20)\n It is possible, for those who really are willing to reckon on the power of the Lord for keeping and victory, to lead a life in which His promises are taken as they stand and are found to be true.\n It is possible to cast all our care upon Him daily and to enjoy deep peace in doing it.\n It is possible to have the thoughts and imaginations of our hearts purified, in the deepest meaning of the word.\n It is possible to see the will of God in everything, and to receive it, not with sighing, but with singing.\n It is possible by taking complete refuge in Divine power to become strong through and through; and, where previously our greatest weakness lay, to find that things which formerly upset all our resolves to be patient, or pure, or humble, furnish today an opportunity━through Him who loved us, and works in us an agreement with His will and a blessed sense of His presence and His power━to make sin powerless over us.\n These things are DIVINE POSSIBILITIES, and because they are His work, the true experience of them will always cause us to bow lower at His feet and to learn to thirst and long for more.\n We cannot possibly be satisfied with anything less━each day, each hour, each moment, in Christ, through the power of the Holy Spirit━than to WALK WITH GOD. ━H. C. G. Moule.\n We may have as much of God as we will. Christ puts the key of the treasure-chamber into our hand, and bids us take all that we want. If a man is admitted into the bullion vault of a bank, and told to help himself, and comes out with one cent, whose fault is it that he is poor? Whose fault is it that Christian people generally have such scanty portions of the free riches of God? ━McLaren\n 二月二十日\n “你们没有一件不能作的事了“ （太十七：20）\n 　　有了信心，我们就没有一件不能的事了。只要我们真相信神有保守和得胜的能力，我们就能看见祂所说的话语和应许，都是实在的。\n 　　我们能天天把我们一切的罣虑和重担卸给神，享受平安和喜乐。\n 　　我们能管辖头脑中的思想，昼夜系念神的话语。\n 　　我们能在每一件事情上清楚神的旨意；不是用叹息，乃是用赞美去接受。\n 　　我们能靠神的恩典刚强；我们以前的软弱，以前叫我们不能忍耐，圣洁与谦卑的罪，今天都能靠着爱我们的主胜过了，使罪完全失去它在我们身上的权势。\n 　　这些都是神恩典中可能的事，如果我们有了这些经历，就会更愿意俯伏在神脚前，也就会更渴慕最高的灵命。\n 　　我们如果不能每天，每小时，每分钟，在基督里，藉着圣灵的能力与神同行，我们就不会得到满足。━慕\n 　　在基督里，我们能有神一切的丰富。主已经把神宝库的钥匙放在我们手中了，祂吩咐我们去无限制地领取一切我们所要的。若是一个银行的行长，准许一个穷人到银行库中去任意取他所要的；假定那个穷人出来的时侯，只带了一文钱，这是谁的过失呢？基督徒能得到神完全的丰富，而仍过着极穷的生活，这是谁的过失呢？━马克拉伦\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4866.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
