{"id":15170,"no":213,"title":"August 1","content":"\"Surrender your very selves to God as living men who have risen from the dead\" (Romans 6:13). (Weymouth)\\n\\n I went one night to hear an address on consecration. No special message came to me from it, but as the speaker kneeled to pray, he dropped this sentence: \"O Lord, Thou knowest we can trust the Man that died for us.\" And that was my message. I rose and walked down the street to the train; and as I walked, I pondered deeply all that consecration might mean to my life and--I was afraid. And then, above the noise and clatter of the street traffic came to me the message: \"You can trust the Man that died for you.\"\\n\\n I got into the train to ride homeward; and as I rode, I thought of the changes, the sacrifices, the disappointments which consecration might mean to me and--I was afraid. \\n\\n I reached home and sought my room, and there upon my knees I saw my past life. I had been a Christian, an officer in the church, a Sunday-school superintendent, but had never definitely yielded my life to God. \\n\\n Yet as I thought of the darling plans which might be baffled, of the cherished hopes to be surrendered, and the chosen profession which I might be called upon to abandoned--I was afraid. \\n\\n I did not see the better things God had for me, so my soul was shrinking back; and then for the last time, with a swift rush of convicting power, came to my innermost heart that searching message: \\n\\n \"My child, you can trust the Man that died for you. If you cannot trust Him whom can you trust?\" \\n\\n That settled it for me, for in a flash I saw that the Man who so loved me as to die for me could be absolutely trusted with all the concerns of the life He had saved. \\n\\n Friend, you can trust the Man that died for you. You can trust Him to baffle no plan which is not best to be foiled, and to carry out every one which is for God\u0027s glory and your highest good. You can trust Him to lead you in the path which is the very best in this world for you.--J H. McC \\n\\n “Just as I am, thy love unknown, \\n\\n Has broken every barrier down, \\n\\n Now to be Thin, yea, Thin ALONE, \\n\\n O lamb of God, I come!”\\n\\n “Life is not salvage to be saved out of the world ,but an investment to be used in the world.”\\n\\n 「要像从死里复活的人，将自己献给神。」（罗六13） \\n\\n 一天晚上，我去听一篇将自己献给神的演说。这篇演说对我并没有特别的帮助，不过当演说者跪下来祷告的时候，他说：「哦，主阿！我们感谢祢，因为我们可以信托那替我们死的救主。」这一句话抓住了我。我立起身来，走向火车站去乘坐火车回家去；在街上行走的时候，我想到：将自己献给神也许会影响我一生的事业━我就畏惧。那时候，车马喧嚷声中来了那个信息：「你可以信托那替你死的救主。」\\n\\n 坐上火车，我又想到：将自己献给神，也许会遭到许多改变、牺牲、失望━我又畏惧。 \\n\\n 到了家中，进了我自己的房间，一跪下来，我就看见我以往的失败。我虽然作了一个基督人，一个教会中的执事，一个主日学校的校长，但是我却未曾将自己献给神。\\n\\n 那时候，我又想到：将自己献给神，也许要挫折我心爱的计划，消灭我将来的希望，放弃所选择的职业━我又畏惧。\\n\\n 我看不见神要给我的那些更美好的东西，所以我的心一直在畏缩；最后，那敏锐的信息，带着责备的口吻，很快地临到了我心的最深处：「我的孩子，你可以信托那替你死的救主。如果你不能信托祂，你还能信托谁呢？」 \\n\\n 这句话替我解决了一切，因为在转瞬间我就看见了：那爱我甚至替我死的救主，是绝对可以信托的；祂对于祂所拯救的人，是负全责的。 \\n\\n 朋友，你可以信托那替你死的救主。你可以信托祂━如果不是应当挫折的计划，祂绝不会去挫折；祂所做的每一件事情，都是为着神的荣耀和你的幸福。你可以信托祂━祂将引领你行走那对你最合适的道路。──麦克康\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5297.html","bookId":475,"book":{"id":475,"title":"Streams In The Desert荒漠甘泉","description":"简介： 《荒漠甘泉》（Streams in the Desert）是基督教的著名灵修书籍，于1920年首次出版。该书不但是20世纪颇为盛名的重要宗教著作，另外也因里面提及的故事颇为动人，因此有不少非基督徒也阅读过此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290474614bf31c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
