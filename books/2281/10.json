Summer was still with them but would begin to fade in the next few weeks. Today, though, the water glistened under a benign sun.\n They were able to see all four officers who’d been on the search and rescue boat. Officer Aldo Reynald had been in charge, and he seemed sincerely interested in their queries.\n “When we got there, the woman was crying her eyes out…Amanda. Yeah, Amanda Channel. She was kneeling over the dead man. She said she’d done CPR, but she didn’t think it helped. She said we had to save her friend. The other guy, Jon Hunt, was walking around the dock, rubbing his chin, scratching his head. I tried CPR as we got him to shore. No luck. We have a state-of-the-art truck to deal with emergencies like this. You get a lot of divers who think they know their stuff and don’t, or divers who are used to the tropics and get into trouble in the lake. And naturally we have boating accidents, so…we’re prepared. We used every possible method of resuscitation on the way to the hospital, but…then we got there and they called it.” He shook his head glumly. “I’m assuming we’re going to have to be vigilant as this whole thing proceeds because diving a wreck is inherently dangerous, and a newly discovered one even more so.”\n Reynald was lean and fit; he was obviously experienced, practical—and compassionate.\n “But you believe he was dead when you arrived?” Kat asked.\n He nodded grimly. “Dead as a cold mackerel, I’m afraid.”\n “How long?” Will asked next.\n “He couldn’t have been dead more than half an hour or so,” Reynald told them. “I’m not sure what I’m basing that on, other than that I’ve pulled more than a few bodies out of the lake. Like I said, he was declared DOA at the hospital.”\n “Were there other boats near the dive spot?” Will asked.\n “Boating on a good day on Lake Michigan? You bet.”\n “Close to the dive site?” Kat continued for Will.\n Reynald drew in a deep breath. “Yeah, near enough, I think. The other Preservation Center boat was there—as well as the one the dead man had been on. Oh, and the film crew has a snazzy research boat, too. There was a sailboat maybe two hundred feet away and others farther out….”\n One of his fellow officers chimed in. “There were two motorboats nearby. One was a Cigarette—nice speedboat. I noticed that because I always wanted one. The other…a little cabin cruiser. Looked like the people aboard were fishing.”\n “Fishing,” Kat echoed dubiously.\n The officer grinned. “Not that long ago, Lake Michigan was so polluted you could die from eating fish you caught out there. But it’s cleaned up. You’ll find lots of people fishing in the lake now.”\n “Did you notice anything else about the boat?” she asked.\n He shook his head. “I’m afraid I didn’t.”\n “Either have a dive flag up?” Will asked.\n “Neither,” the second officer replied.\n “We were called in on an accident, and rescue was our main objective,” Reynald told them. “I feel like a fool because we’re also law enforcement officers. Do you suspect it was more than an accident?”\n Kat answered carefully. “We’re not sure yet. We’re just investigating at this point.”\n “Well, we’re here anytime you need us,” Reynald said.\n They thanked him. As they headed back to the car, Will seemed thoughtful. He glanced over at her. “You tired? You want to call it quits for the day?”\n She scowled back at him. If she’d been falling off her feet, she’d never have admitted it to this man. “I’m fine. What do you have in mind?”\n “Two quick stops—Landry Salvage and Simonton’s Sea Search. Neither may really help. Salvage companies don’t usually drive around in Cigarette speedboats, but…”\n “And if someone else is searching for treasure, that person may not be involved with a salvage company at all,” Kat added.\n He paused at the car door, looking over it. “True. But you have to know something about diving to get down there. You’d have to follow the research to find the ship—and you’d have to follow Brady Laurie out to the site…and gone after him right away.”\n “Maybe it’s someone who works for a salvage company,” Kat suggested. “Not the company itself.”\n “That would be my bet.” Will grinned as she joined him in the front seat. “Your choice—Landry or Simonton’s Sea Search first?”\n “Simonton’s. I like the alliteration,” she said.\n Simonton’s was just north of the pier. There was a massive vessel with all kinds of cranes and netting at the dock. The office itself was small and looked more like a sea shanty than a professional building. Inside, Kat was surprised to see that it was nicely outfitted with modern office furniture and file cabinets that occupied most of the wall space. The walls were decorated with old anchors, flags and other boating paraphernalia. A receptionist who introduced herself as Gina led them to a back room, where the walls were decorated with sea charts and maps, and the rear wall held the figurehead of a beautiful siren.\n The man standing behind the desk was in a windbreaker, deck shoes and jeans. His desk was strewn with papers, despite the computer that took up at least half of it. “Hi. I’m Andy Simonton,” he greeted them. “What can I do for you?”\n He was young, maybe thirty, with slightly shaggy blond hair and bright blue eyes. He swept out a hand to indicate the chairs in front of his messy desk. They sat.\n “You’re with the FBI?” he asked curiously. He didn’t seem afraid or threatened in any way, but rather intrigued.\n “We’re looking into the death of Brady Laurie,” Will said.\n “Sad affair, that drowning,” Simonton murmured.\n “This is your company?” Kat asked him.\n Simonton nodded. “My father’s company, really. He wants to retire. I’ve been handling the business for about a year.”\n “And what is your business, exactly?” Will asked.\n Simonton looked confused. “Um, salvage.”\n Will had the grace to laugh. “No, I’m sorry, what type of salvage? What are you working on now?”\n “Oh!” Simonton said. “We’re conducting two recovery missions. A Florida boater underestimated the power of the lake and sank a sixty-foot sailboat, and we’re also working on recovering the cargo from the hold of the Mystic Susan—she’s a merchant vessel that went down with crates of high-fashion clothing,” Simonton explained.\n “That does sound like work. Not terribly exciting,” Kat said sympathetically.\n Simonton gave a nonchalant shrug. “It pays the bills, and quite nicely, too. Oh, and Mrs. Ciskel—she’s the wife of the Florida boater—is furious because she had a lot of jewelry aboard when their boat went down. I’d like to find that cache myself. To return to her, of course. She’s promised a massive bonus if we get back all her jewels.” He frowned. “Now, what’s this all about?”\n “We were wondering if you’d ever had any plans to explore and salvage the Jerry McGuen,” Will said.\n “We were invited to the reception put on by the Egyptian Sand Diggers.”\n Kat glanced at Will. “The Egyptian Sand Diggers?” he repeated. “Who are they?”\n Simonton waved one hand in the air. “They’re a local service club—and they’re just a little nutty, you know? In love with all things ancient Egyptian. Some of them are true scholars, while the rest are more what you’d call armchair historians. They held a reception about six months ago, and they shared all sorts of current information on expeditions into the Valley of the Kings, the closing of the Great Pyramids for maintenance, stuff like that. And they had an exhibit on Gregory Hudson—he’s the guy who discovered the Amun Mopat tomb way back—and the Jerry McGuen. They were trying to encourage local salvage companies to search for her. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time or money to go on a wild-goose chase, although I wish I had gone on that goose chase. I suppose the location is pretty well-known by now and anyone might have found her after she shifted on the seabed. See, it was wide open. The State of Illinois gets everything recovered in this area of Lake Michigan, but the salvage company that finds it does get certain rights. The original company went bust soon after the sinking of the Jerry McGuen and the passengers’ families were paid off with what was left, so any descendants aren’t really a factor. Now, as far as the salvage goes, the State of Illinois would probably return most of it to the Egyptians.”\n “Do you know of anyone else who was planning to go after the ship?” Kat asked.\n “Landry,” he said. “He and my dad were always competitive. Maybe he wanted to find it just to rub in my dad’s face—or my face now. He was at the reception, by the way.”\n “How many boats do you have, Mr. Simonton?” Will asked.\n “I have a little Mako for my own pleasure,” Simonton said. “You can go see her if you want. She’s sitting right outside.”\n “This looks like a good operation.” Kat smiled. “And obviously a successful one.”\n “I’m all about paying the bills,” Simonton said. He tapped a pencil on his desk. “Can I do anything else for you? I’m sorry, but I’m kind of busy and…well, honestly, I’m not really sure what you’re after.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unspoken-krewe-of-hunters-7/page-10.html","bookId":2281,"book":{"id":2281,"title":"The Unspoken (Krewe of Hunters #7)","description":"Storyline: \n The Unspoken (Krewe of Hunters #7) \n 1898: Bound for Chicago, the freighter Jerry McGuen goes down in Lake Michigan, taking with it every man aboard.
