And when we went down to the wreck, I wasn’t dreaming, and it wasn’t real, but in my mind’s eye, I could almost see the ship as I’d seen it in my dream.”\n “What you see in your subconscious can be important. I know that you’re thinking, Ugh, mummy. Extra ugh, mummy of Amun Mopat. But maybe we should be looking more at the ship. I don’t believe the ship went down because it was cursed or because it carried an Egyptian mummy. I’m not saying that. But maybe there was more to the ship herself. Do you remember anything else about the dream?”\n “Yes, actually,” she said, petting the cat absently. “I dreamed that something massive seemed to be coming out of the night and out of the storm. That it was coming toward the ship. Amun Mopat’s ‘curse,’ maybe, except I don’t believe in curses, either. I’m a big proponent of the free will concept. But I do believe we can fulfill expectations and, for some people, a curse might be an expectation.”\n “Also known as self-fulfilling prophecies,” he murmured. “I’m with you on that. Have you dreamed about this?”\n She laughed. “No, although I did have another dream. A typical The Mummy dream. I was walking or floating somewhere and suddenly an army of mummies was coming at me. I became pathologist Katya Sokolov in the dream, telling myself I was in no danger because a mummy was brittle and would break when I punched it. But Amun Mopat was behind the mummies, and the mummies didn’t break. And then I woke up.”\n He was silent for a minute.\n “I told you—silly dream,” she said.\n “It’s not silly. I think our dreams may be part of how we communicate with ghosts—or souls that still have to depart the earth or this plane or whatever. They talk to us and show us things while we’re in a state of unconsciousness, or a different consciousness if you prefer. If you dream again, write it all down as soon as you wake up.”\n “You’re probably right,” she said. “I know that in Texas, one of my team members, Kelsey, kept having strange dreams and visions of events that had gone on years before—and they did lead her to the truth. It’s just that dreams like this aren’t…well, conducive to good sleep!”\n He laughed and reached over, ruffling her hair. It began as a friendly gesture, but his hand lingered and his eyes were on hers for a moment. She suddenly remembered how he’d looked in his pajama bottoms and was shocked by the intense urge for closeness that seemed to overwhelm her. She’d recognized him as an intriguing and handsome man the first time she’d set eyes on him; she had, almost without being aware of it, labeled him sexy and sensual when they’d run around the hotel in their nightwear. But she was surrounded by striking men who were made even more so by their ethics, determination and strength. She wasn’t sure why Will Chan suddenly seemed more seductive to her than any other man.\n Maybe he returned that thought. He quickly withdrew his hand, setting it on the steering wheel. “I’m not leaving, you know, until this is over.”\n “I didn’t think you were going to drop me off and head for the airport.”\n “No, I mean when more agents show up. I gather Logan’s already here. But I’ve checked in with Jackson Crow, and I’m staying on this. I guess because I was here when it started and I feel I have to see it through.”\n “I understand that feeling.”\n “I’m just saying that…well, we’re in this together. Don’t keep things from me.”\n “I’ll say ditto to you.”\n “Look, I know you weren’t fond of working with me. I can tell that you think I can be rude and blunt.”\n “I think you can be a total jerk.”\n Grinning, he turned to her. “Okay, I promise I’ll try not to be.”\n “So what annoys you about me?” she asked.\n He was thoughtful for a minute. “Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”\n He put the car back in gear, and they drove the last few blocks to the hotel.\n 7\n It was late when they finally returned to the hotel. Will was tired, too—and he hadn’t performed any autopsies.\n When they arrived, the desk clerk told them that five more of their “company” had checked in—Logan Raintree, Kelsey O’Brien, Tyler Montague, Jane Everett and Sean Cameron. He was also quick to assure Will that the cameras in the elevators were now functioning, although, he said apologetically, it would be some time before the hotel had cameras in the hallways. Will thanked him as he and Kat walked to the elevators.\n “I wonder if I should wake my Krewe,” Kat said, “and find out what, if anything, they’ve found out or have planned.”\n “Let’s get Bastet settled first, huh?” Will suggested. Kat was holding the Mau; Will was lugging a litter box, a bag of litter and the cat food he’d bought. Luckily the hotel was pet-friendly.\n “Good idea. And it is late. I’m sure everyone will be up early in the morning,” Kat said.\n Upstairs, while she continued to hold Bastet, he maneuvered his key card while balancing his purchases. But he’d barely opened the door when he heard her name being called.\n Logan Raintree stood in the hallway across from them.\n “Hi, Logan! Just a second,” Kat said.\n “You two went out and bought an Egyptian cat?” Logan asked. “Aren’t you getting carried away with the subject matter?”\n “She’s…she’s an orphan,” Kat said. “Want company in the suite?”\n “Love it. Come on over and bring me up to speed,” Logan told them. “I can show you the printouts of the research we’ve done.”\n “Great!” Will strode into the room, aware that Kat was following him, still carrying a compliant Bastet. He decided the bathroom was the best place to set up a litter box. He’d never had a cat before, but it seemed logical.\n “Hey!” Kat called to him.\n “Yeah?” With the litter bag half-open, he looked out at her.\n “Did you think to buy some dishes?”\n “Dishes,” he said blankly.\n “Pet bowls. For the food. And water. I know a cat can go a while without food, but water’s a necessity.”\n He stared at her, wondering how he’d forgotten such a basic. If he’d thought of it, he could have taken bowls from Austin Miller’s house, but the only thing on his mind had been that this animal needed to be cared for.\n Kat laughed, and he liked the sound, sweet and unaffected. Her lips curved upward and her eyes seemed even bluer, even brighter. He cleared his throat, looking away.\n “Mmm-hmm,” he managed.\n “It’s okay. The restaurant’s closed, but there’s a soap dish in my room I can wash out. We’ll use that for water. You can rinse yours out for food,” she said. “Somewhere—in between diving, researching and trying to communicate with the spirit world tomorrow—we can find a pet shop.”\n “Or just grab the bowls from Miller’s house.”\n “That, too,” Kat agreed.\n In another few minutes, they had Bastet set up. They left her happily ensconced on Will’s bed, regally cleaning her paws.\n “Wasn’t Bastet a goddess?” Kat asked him as they crossed the hall.\n “Yes. The ancient Egyptian cat goddess.”\n Logan opened the door as they knocked. He was alone.\n Will had only met him a few times, when they’d all been back at their special-units offices in Virginia. He was lean and fit, with a controlled, wiry strength; he was also calm and levelheaded, a man who thought before he spoke. Logan reminded him of his own team leader, Jackson Crow. While they were the authority figures in their groups, they knew how to work in ensemble situations, and both had an uncanny sense of who to send where and under what circumstances.\n “The others are all in bed?” Kat asked him.\n Logan nodded. “But we’re good to go in the morning. Kelsey is going to investigate the members of the Egyptian Sand Diggers and find out who else was at that party. I’ve got Tyler checking on the people at Landry Salvage and I’ll take Simonton’s Sea Search. Jane will stay at the police station and be available to you—or whoever needs her. Did you learn anything at the autopsy, Kat?”\n “I learned that he died of sudden and massive heart failure, which was not really unexpected. The doctor on duty was wonderful. I told him my colleagues might want to see the body. He’s an experienced old-timer, and a team player to the nth degree. An excellent connection,” Kat said. She nudged Will. “Show Logan what you found.”\n He reached into his pocket and took out the two evidence bags. “The first I scraped off the wall right here on this floor when Kat and I thought we were being followed. The second came from the wall surrounding Austin Miller’s estate.”\n Logan stared at the bags and then at Will. “It looks like the wrapping from what we perceive as the stereotypical mummy,” he said.\n “Exactly.”\n “I’ll get these to our lab first thing in the morning,” Logan told him.\n “Thanks,” Will said. “I’ll be interested to see what they come back with.”\n “Me, too.” He turned to Kat. “You want to keep up with the diving expedition?”\n “Yes. I think it’s important.”\n “I noticed the camera in the hallway. Is that yours?” Logan asked Will.\n He nodded. “I’ll look at the footage before I go to bed.”\n “Great. We’ll meet for breakfast in the morning,” Logan said. “Now, get some sleep. We’ll see you downstairs around seven.”\n They bade him good-night. Will was glad Logan had come, and glad that Kat’s team was there to handle the strenuous and exhaustive work of investigating the many people who might have been involved. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unspoken-krewe-of-hunters-7/page-21.html","bookId":2281,"book":{"id":2281,"title":"The Unspoken (Krewe of Hunters #7)","description":"Storyline: \n The Unspoken (Krewe of Hunters #7) \n 1898: Bound for Chicago, the freighter Jerry McGuen goes down in Lake Michigan, taking with it every man aboard.
