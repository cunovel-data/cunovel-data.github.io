Part of the reason, of course, was that Tessie was breaking her neck to vindicate her behavior. But whatever the reason, Barbara Carter was going to emerge as the hottest new producer of the year. It was going to be a terrific year for costume designers.\\n\\n The television shows produced by Pan-Pacific were doing well, and \"My Man Friday\" was the biggest of them all. The network was talking to Sam about a new five-year contract for the series.\\n\\n Sam was preparing to leave for lunch when Lucille hurried in and said, \"They just caught someone setting a fire in the prop department. They\u0027re bringing him over here now.\"\\n\\n The man sat in a chair facing Sam in silence, two studio guards standing behind him. His eyes were bright with malice. Sam had still not gotten over his shock. \"Why?\" he asked. \"For God\u0027s sake - why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I didn\u0027t want your fucking charity,\" Dallas Burke said. \"I hate you and this studio and the whole rotten business. I built this business, you son of a bitch. I paid for half the studios in this lousy town. Everybody got rich off me. Why didn\u0027t you give me a picture to direct instead of trying to pay me off by pretending to buy a bunch of fucking stolen fairy tales? You would have bought the phone book from me, Sam. I didn\u0027t want any favors from you - I wanted a job. You\u0027re making me die a failure, you prick, and I\u0027ll never forgive you for that.\"\\n\\n Long after they had taken Dallas Burke away, Sam sat there thinking about him, remembering the great things Dallas had done, the wonderful movies he had made. In any other business, he would have been a hero, the chairman of the board or would have been retired with a nice, fat pension and glory.\\n\\n But this was the wonderful world of show business. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stranger-in-the-mirror/page-16.html","bookId":2355,"book":{"id":2355,"title":"A Stranger in the Mirror","description":"Storyline: A Stranger in the Mirror is a 1976 novel written by Sidney Sheldon.
