{"id":67198,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Hollywood was more exciting than Jill Castle had ever dreamed. She went on sightseeing tours and saw the outside of the stars\u0027 homes. And she knew that one day she would have a beautiful home in Bel-Air or Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, Jill lived in an old roominghouse, an ugly two-story wooden structure that had been converted into an even uglier twelve-bedroom house with tiny bedrooms. Her room was inexpensive, which meant that she could stretch out the two hundred dollars she had saved up. The house was located on Bronson, a few minutes from Hollywood and Vine streets, the heart of Hollywood, and was convenient to the motion-picture studios. There was another feature about the house that attracted Jill. There were a dozen roomers, and all of them were either trying to get into pictures, were working in pictures as extras or bit players or had retired from the Business. The old-timers floated around the house in yellowed robes and curlers, frayed suits and scuffed shoes that would no longer take a shine. The roomers looked used up, rather than old. There was a common living room with battered and sprung furniture where they all gathered in the evening to exchange gossip. Everyone gave Jill advice, most of it contradictory. \"The way to get into pictures, honey, is you find yourself an AD who likes you.\" This from a sour-faced lady who had recently been fired from a television series. \"What\u0027s an AD?\" Jill asked. \"An assistant director.\" In a tone that pitied Jill\u0027s ignorance. \"He\u0027s the one who hires the supes.\" Jill was too embarrassed to ask what the \"supes\" were. \"If you want my advice, you\u0027ll find yourself a horny casting director. An AD can only use you on his picture. A casting director can put you into everything.\" This from a toothless woman who must have been in her eighties. \"Yeah? Most of them are fags.\" A balding character actor. \"What\u0027s the difference? I mean, if it gets one launched?\" An intense, bespectacled young man who burned to be a writer. \"What about starting out as an extra?\" Jill asked. \"Central Casting - \" \"Forget it. Central Casting\u0027s books are closed. They won\u0027t even register you unless you\u0027re a specialty.\" \"I\u0027m - I\u0027m sorry. What\u0027s a specialty?\" \"It\u0027s like if you\u0027re an amputee. That pays thirty-three fifty-eight instead of the regular twenty-one fifty. Or if you own dinner clothes or can ride a horse, you make twenty-eight thirty-three. If you know how to deal cards or handle the stick at a crap table, that\u0027s twenty-eight thirty-three. If you can play football or baseball, that pays thirty-three fifty-eight - same as an amputee. If you ride a camel or an elephant, it\u0027s fifty-five ninety-four. Take my advice, forget about being an extra. Go for a bit part.\" \"I\u0027m not sure what the difference is,\" Jill confessed. \"A bit player\u0027s got at least one line to say. Extras ain\u0027t allowed to talk, except the omnies.\" \"The what?\" \"The omnies - the ones who make background noises.\" \"First thing you gotta do is get yourself an agent.\" \"How do I find one?\" \"They\u0027re listed in the Screen Actor. That\u0027s the magazine the Screen Actors Guild puts out. I got a copy in my room. I\u0027ll get it.\" They all looked through the list of agents with Jill, and finally narrowed it down to a dozen of the smaller ones. The consensus of opinion was that Jill would not have a chance at a large agency. Armed with the list, Jill began to make the rounds. The first six agents would not even talk to her. She ran into the seventh as he was leaving his office. \"Excuse me,\" Jill said. \"I\u0027m looking for an agent.\" He eyed her a moment and said, \"Let\u0027s see your portfolio.\" She stared at him blankly. \"My what?\" \"You must have just gotten off the bus. You can\u0027t operate in this town without a book. Get some pictures taken. Different poses. Glamour stuff. Tits and ass.\" Jill found a photographer in Culver City near the David Selznick Studios, who did her portfolio for thirty-five dollars. She picked up the pictures a week later and was very pleased with them. She looked beautiful. All of her moods had been captured by the camera. She was pensive...angry...loving...sexy. The photographer had bound the pictures together in a book with looseleaf cellophane pages. \"At the front here,\" he explained, \"you put your acting credits.\" Credits. That was the next step. By the end of the next two weeks, Jill had seen, or tried to see, every agent on her list. None of them was remotely interested. One of them told her, \"You were in here yesterday, honey.\" She shook her head. \"No, I wasn\u0027t.\" \"Well, she looked exactly like you. That\u0027s the problem. You all look like Elizabeth Taylor or Lana Turner or Ava Gardner. If you were in any other town trying to get a job in any other business, everybody would grab you. You\u0027re beautiful, you\u0027re sexy-looking, and you\u0027ve got a great figure. But in Hollywood, looks are a drug on the market. Beautiful girls come here from all over the world. They starred in their high school play or they won a beauty contest or their boyfriend told them they ought to be in pictures - and whammo! They flock here by the thousands, and they\u0027re all the same girl. Believe me, honey, you were in here yesterday.\" The boarders helped Jill make a new list of agents. Their offices were smaller and the locations were in the cheap-rent district, but the results were the same. \"Come back when you\u0027ve got some acting experience, kid. You\u0027re a looker, and for all I know you could be the greatest thing since Garbo, but I can\u0027t waste my time finding out. You go get yourself a screen credit and I\u0027ll be your agent.\" \"How can I get a screen credit if no one will give me a job?\" He nodded. \"Yeah. That\u0027s the problem. Lots of luck.\" There was only one agency left on Jill\u0027s list, recommended by a girl she had sat next to at the Mayflower Coffee Shop on Hollywood Boulevard. The Dunning Agency was located in a small bungalow off La Cienega in a residential area. Jill had telephoned for an appointment, and a woman had told her to come in at six o\u0027clock. Jill found herself in a small office that had once been someone\u0027s living room. There was an old scarred desk littered with papers, a fake-leather couch mended with white surgical tape and three rattan chairs scattered around the room. A tall, heavyset woman with a pockmarked face came out of another room and said, \"Hello. Can I help you?\" \"I\u0027m Jill Castle. I have an appointment to see Mr. Dunning.\" \"Miss Dunning,\" the woman said. \"That\u0027s me.\" \"Oh,\" said Jill, in surprise. \"I\u0027m sorry, I thought - \" The woman\u0027s laugh was warm and friendly. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" But it does matter, Jill thought, filled with a sudden excitement. Why hadn\u0027t it occurred to her before? A woman agent! Someone who had gone through all the traumas, someone who would understand what it was like for a young girl just starting out. She would be more sympathetic than any man could ever be. \"I see you brought your portfolio,\" Miss Dunning was saying. \"May I look at it?\" \"Certainly,\" Jill said. She handed it over. The woman sat down, opened the portfolio and began to turn the pages, nodding approval. \"The camera likes you.\" Jill did not know what to say. \"Thank you.\" The agent studied the pictures of Jill in a bathing suit. \"You\u0027ve got a good figure. That\u0027s important. Where you from?\" \"Texas,\" Jill said. \"Odessa.\" \"How long have you been in Hollywood, Jill?\" \"About two months.\" \"How many agents have you been to?\" For an instant, Jill was tempted to lie, but there was nothing but compassion and understanding in the woman\u0027s eyes. \"About thirty, I guess.\" The agent laughed. \"So you finally got down to Rose Dunning. Well, you could have done worse. I\u0027m not MCA or William Morris, but I keep my people working.\" \"I haven\u0027t had any acting experience.\" The woman nodded, unsurprised. \"If you had, you\u0027d be at MCA or William Morris. I\u0027m a kind of breaking-in station. I get the kids with talent started, and then the big agencies snatch them away from me.\" For the first time in weeks, Jill began to feel a sense of hope. \"Do - do you think you\u0027d be interested in handling me?\" she asked. The woman smiled. \"I have clients working who aren\u0027t half as pretty as you. I think I can put you to work. That\u0027s the only way you\u0027ll ever get experience, right?\" Jill felt a glow of gratitude. \"The trouble with this damned town is that they won\u0027t give kids like you a chance. All the studios scream that they\u0027re desperate for new talent, and then they put up a big wall and won\u0027t let anybody in. Well, we\u0027ll fool \u0027em. I know of three things you might be right for. A daytime soap, a bit in the Toby Temple picture and a part in the new Tessie Brand movie.\" Jill\u0027s head was spinning. \"But would they - \" \"If I recommend you, they\u0027ll take you. I don\u0027t send clients who aren\u0027t good. They\u0027re just bit parts, you understand, but it will be a start.\" \"I can\u0027t tell you how grateful I\u0027d be,\" Jill said. \"I think I\u0027ve got the soap-opera script here.\" Rose Dunning lumbered to her feet, pushing herself out of her chair, and walked into the next room, beckoning Jill to follow her. The room was a bedroom with a double bed in a corner under a window and a metal filing cabinet in the opposite corner. Rose Dunning waddled over to the filing cabinet, opened a drawer, took out a script and brought it over to Jill. \"Here we are. The casting director is a good friend of mine, and if you come through on this, he\u0027ll keep you busy.\" \"I\u0027ll come through,\" Jill promised fervently. The agent smiled and said, \"Course, I can\u0027t send over a pig in a poke. Would you mind reading for me?\" \"No. Certainly not.\" The agent opened the script and sat down on the bed. \"Let\u0027s read this scene.\" Jill sat on the bed next to her and looked at the script. \"Your character is Natalie. She\u0027s a rich girl who\u0027s married to a weakling. She decides to divorce him, and he won\u0027t let her. You make your entrance here.\" Jill quickly scanned the scene. She wished she had had a chance to study the script overnight or even for an hour. She was desperately anxious to make a good impression. \"Ready?\" \"I - I think so,\" Jill said. She closed her eyes and tried to think like the character. A rich woman. Like the mothers of the friends that she had grown up with, people who took it for granted that they could have anything they wanted in life, believing that other people were there for their convenience. The Cissy Toppings of the world. She opened her eyes, looked down at the script and began to read. \"I want to talk to you, Peter.\" \"Can\u0027t it wait?\" That was Rose Dunning, cueing her. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s waited too long already. I\u0027m catching a plane for Reno this afternoon.\" \"Just like that?\" \"No. I\u0027ve been trying to catch that plane for five years, Peter. This time I\u0027m going to make it.\" Jill felt Rose Dunning\u0027s hand patting her thigh. \"That\u0027s very good,\" the agent said, approvingly. \"Keep reading.\" She let her hand rest on Jill\u0027s leg. \"Your problem is that you haven\u0027t grown up yet. You\u0027re still playing games. Well, from now on, you\u0027re going to have to play by yourself.\" Rose Dunning\u0027s hand was stroking her thigh. It was disconcerting. \"Fine. Go on,\" she said. \"I - I don\u0027t want you to try to get in touch with me ever again. Is that quite clear?\" The hand was stroking Jill faster, moving toward her groin. Jill lowered the script and looked at Rose Dunning. The woman\u0027s face was flushed and her eyes had a glazed look in them. \"Keep reading,\" she said huskily. \"I - I can\u0027t,\" Jill said. \"If you - \" The woman\u0027s hand began to move faster. \"This is to get you in the mood, darling. It\u0027s a sexual fight, you see. I want to feel the sex in you.\" Her hand was pressing harder now, moving between Jill\u0027s legs. \"No!\" Jill got to her feet, trembling. Saliva was dribbling out of the corner of the woman\u0027s mouth. \"Be good to me and I\u0027ll be good to you.\" Her voice was pleading. \"Come here, baby.\" She held out her arms and made a grab for her, and Jill ran out of the office. In the street outside, she vomited. Even when the wracking spasms were over and her stomach had quieted down, she felt no better. Her headache had started again. It was not fair. The headaches didn\u0027t belong to her. They belonged to Josephine Czinski. During the next fifteen months, Jill Castle became a full-fledged member of the Survivors, the tribe of people on the fringes of show business who spent years and sometimes a whole lifetime trying to break into the Business, working at other jobs temporarily. The fact that the temporary jobs sometimes lasted ten or fifteen years did not discourage them. As ancient tribes once sat around long-ago campfires and recounted sagas of brave deeds, so the Survivors sat around Schwab\u0027s Drugstore, telling and retelling heroic tales of show business, nursing cups of cold coffee while they exchanged the latest bits of inside gossip. They were outside the Business, and yet, in some mysterious fashion, they were at the very pulse and heartbeat of it. They could tell you what star was going to be replaced, what producer had been caught sleeping with his director, what network head was about to be kicked upstairs. They knew these things before anyone else did, through their own special kind of jungle drums. For the Business was a jungle. They had no illusions about that. Their illusions lay in another direction. They thought they could find a way to get through the studio gates, scale the studio walls. They were artists, they were the Chosen. Hollywood was their Jericho and Joshua would blow his golden trumpet and the mighty gates would fall before them and their enemies would be smitten, and lo, Sam Winters\u0027s magic wand would be waved and they would be wearing silken robes and be Movie Stars and adored ever after by their grateful public, Amen. The coffee at Schwab\u0027s was heady sacramental wine, and they were the Disciples of the future, huddling together for comfort, warming one another with their dreams, on the very brink of making it. They had met an assistant director who told them a producer who said a casting director who promised and any second now, and the reality would be in their grasp. In the meantime, they worked in supermarkets and garages and beauty parlors and car washes. They lived with each other and married each other and divorced each other, and they never noticed how time was betraying them. They were unaware of the new lines and the graying temples, and the fact that it took half an hour longer in the morning to put on makeup. They had become shopworn without having been used, aged without mellowing, too old for a career with a plastics company, too old to have babies, too old for those younger parts once so coveted. They were now character actors. But they still dreamed. The younger and prettier girls were picking up what they called mattress money. \"Why break your ass over some nine-to-five job when all you have to do is lay on your back a few minutes and pick up an easy twenty bucks? Just till your agent calls.\" Jill was not interested. Her only interest in life was her career. A poor Polish girl could never marry a David Kenyon. She knew that now. But Jill Castle, the movie star, could have anybody and anything she wanted. Unless she could achieve that, she would change back into Josephine Czinski again. She would never let that happen. Jill\u0027s first acting job came through Harriet Marcus, one of the Survivors who had a third cousin whose ex-brother-in-law was a second assistant director on a television medical series shooting at Universal Studios. He agreed to give Jill a chance. The part consisted of one line, for which Jill was to receive fifty-seven dollars, minus deductions for Social Security, withholding taxes and the Motion Picture Relief Home. Jill was to play the part of a nurse. The script called for her to be in a hospital room at a patient\u0027s bedside, taking his pulse when the doctor entered. DOCTOR: \"How is he, Nurse?\" NURSE: \"Not very good, I\u0027m afraid, Doctor.\" That was it. Jill was given a single, mimeographed page from the script on a Monday afternoon and told to report for makeup at six A.M. the following morning. She went over the scene a hundred times. She wished the studio had given her the entire script. How did they expect her to figure out what the character was like from one page? Jill tried to analyze what kind of a woman the nurse might be. Was she married? Single? She could be secretly in love with the doctor. Or maybe they had had an affair and it was over. How did she feel about the patient? Did she hate the thought of his death? Or would it be a blessing? \"Not very good, I\u0027m afraid, Doctor.\" She tried to put concern in her voice. She tried again. \"Not very good. I\u0027m afraid, Doctor.\" Alarmed. He was going to die. \"Not very good, I\u0027m afraid, Doctor.\" Accusing. It was the doctor\u0027s fault. If he had not been away with his mistress... Jill stayed up the entire night working on the part, too keyed-up to sleep, but in the morning, when she reported to the studio, she felt exhilarated and alive. It was still dark when she arrived at the guard\u0027s gate off Lankershim Boulevard, in a car borrowed from her friend Harriet. Jill gave the guard her name, and he checked it against a roster and waved her on. \"Stage Seven,\" he said. \"Two blocks down, turn right.\" Her name was on the roster. Universal Studios was expecting her. It was like a wonderful dream. As Jill drove toward the sound stage, she decided she would discuss the part with the director, let him know that she was capable of giving him any interpretation he wanted. Jill pulled into the large parking lot and went onto Stage Seven. The sound stage was crowded with people busily moving lights, carrying electrical equipment, setting up the camera, giving orders in a foreign language she did not understand. \"Hit the inky dink and give me a brute.... I need a scrim here.... Kill the baby....\" Jill stood there watching, savoring the sights and smells and sounds of show business. This was her world, her future. She would find a way to impress the director, show him that she was someone special. He would get to know her as a person, not as just another actress. The second assistant director herded Jill and a dozen other actors over to Wardrobe, where Jill was handed a nurse\u0027s uniform and sent back to the sound stage, where she was made up with all the other bit players in a corner of the sound stage. Just as they were finished with her, the assistant director called her name. Jill hurried on to the hospital-room set where the director stood near the camera, talking to the star of the series. The star\u0027s name was Rod Hanson, and he played a surgeon full of compassion and wisdom. As Jill approached them, Rod Hanson was saying, \"I have a German shepherd that can fart better dialogue than this shit. Why can\u0027t the writers give me some character, for Christ\u0027s sake?\" \"Rod, we\u0027ve been on the air five years. Don\u0027t improve a hit. The public loves you the way you are.\" The cameraman walked up to the director. \"All lit, chief.\" \"Thanks, Hal,\" the director said. He turned to Rod Hanson. \"Can we make this, baby? We\u0027ll finish the discussion later.\" \"One of these days, I\u0027m going to wipe my ass with this studio,\" Hanson snapped. He strode away. Jill turned to the director, who was now alone. This was her opportunity to discuss the interpretation of the character, to show him that she understood his problems and was there to help make the scene great. She gave him a warm, friendly smile. \"I\u0027m Jill Castle,\" she said. \"I\u0027m playing the nurse. I think she can really be very interesting and I have some ideas about - \" He nodded absently and said, \"Over by the bed,\" and walked away to speak to the cameraman. Jill stood looking after him, stunned. The second assistant director, Harriet\u0027s third cousin\u0027s ex-brother-in-law, hurried up to Jill and said in a low voice, \"For Chrissakes, didn\u0027t you hear him? Over by the bed!\" \"I wanted to ask him - \" \"Don\u0027t blow it!\" he whispered fiercely. \"Get out there!\" Jill walked over to the patient\u0027s bed. \"All right. Let\u0027s have it quiet, everybody.\" The assistant director looked at the director. \"Do you want a rehearsal, chief?\" \"For this? Let\u0027s go for a take.\" \"Give us a bell. Settle down, everybody. Nice and quiet. We\u0027re rolling. Speed.\" Unbelievingly, Jill listened to the sound of the bell. She looked frantically toward the director, wanting to ask him how he would like her to interpret the scene, what her relationship was to the dying man, what she was - A voice called, \"Action!\" They were all looking at Jill expectantly. She wondered whether she dare ask them to stop the cameras for just a second, so she could discuss the scene and - The director yelled, \"Jesus Christ! Nurse! This isn\u0027t a morgue - it\u0027s a hospital. Feel his goddamned pulse before he dies of old age!\" Jill looked anxiously into the circle of bright lights around her. She took a deep breath, lifted the patient\u0027s hand and took his pulse. If they would not help her, she would have to interpret the scene in her own way. The patient was the father of the doctor. The two of them had quarreled. The father had been in an accident and the doctor had just been notified. Jill looked up and saw Rod Hanson approaching. He walked up to her and said, \"How is he, Nurse?\" Jill looked into the doctor\u0027s eyes and read the concern there. She wanted to tell him the truth, that his father was dying, that it was too late for them to make up their quarrel. Yet she had to break it to him in such a way that it would not destroy him and - The director was yelling, \"Cut! Cut! Cut! Goddamn it, the idiot\u0027s got one line, and she can\u0027t even remember it. Where did you find her - in the Yellow Pages?\" Jill turned toward the voice shouting from the darkness, aflame with embarrassment. \"I - I know my line,\" she said shakily. \"I was just trying to - \" \"Well, if you know it, for Chrissakes, would you mind saying it? You could drive a train through that pause. When he asks you the fucking question, answer it. Okay?\" \"I was just wondering if I should - \" \"Let\u0027s go again, right away. Give us a bell.\" \"We\u0027re on a bell. Hold it down. We\u0027re rolling.\" \"Speed.\" \"Action.\" Jill\u0027s legs were trembling. It was as though she was the only one here who cared about the scene. All she had wanted to do was create something beautiful. The hot lights were making her dizzy, and she could feel the perspiration running down her arms ruining the crisp, starched uniform. \"Action! Nurse!\" Jill stood over the patient and put her hand on his pulse. If she did the scene wrong again, they would never give her another chance. She thought of Harriet and of her friends at the roominghouse and of what they would say. The doctor entered and walked up to her. \"How is he, Nurse?\" She would no longer be one of them. She would be a laughingstock. Hollywood was a small town. Word got around fast. \"Not very good, I\u0027m afraid, Doctor.\" No other studio would touch her. It would be her last job. It would be the end of everything, her whole world. The doctor said, \"I want this man put in intensive care immediately.\" \"Good!\" the director called. \"Cut and print.\" Jill was hardly aware of the people rushing past her, starting to dismantle the set to make room for the next one. She had done her first scene - and she had been thinking about something else. She could not believe it was over. She wondered whether she should find the director and thank him for the opportunity, but he was at the other end of the stage talking to a group of people. The second assistant director came up to her and squeezed her arm and said, \"You did okay, kid. Only next time, learn your lines.\" There was film on her; she had her first credit. From now on , Jill thought, I\u0027ll be working all the time Jill\u0027s next acting job was thirteen months later, when she did a bit part at MGM. In the meantime, she held a series of civilian jobs. She became the local Avon lady, she worked behind a soda fountain and - briefly - she drove a taxi. With her money running low, Jill decided to share an apartment with Harriet Marcus. It was a two-bedroom apartment and Harriet kept her bedroom working overtime. Harriet worked at a downtown department store as a model. She was an attractive girl with short dark hair, black eyes, a model\u0027s boyish figure and a sense of humor. \"When you come from Hoboken,\" she told Jill, \"you\u0027d better have a sense of humor.\" In the beginning, Jill had been a bit daunted by Harriet\u0027s cool self-sufficiency, but she soon learned that underneath that sophisticated facade, Harriet was a warm, frightened child. She was in love constantly. The first time Jill met her, Harriet said, \"I want you to meet Ralph. We\u0027re getting married next month.\" A week later, Ralph had left for parts unknown, taking with him Harriet\u0027s car. A few days after Ralph had departed, Harriet met Tony. He was in import-export and Harriet was head-over-heels in love with him. \"He\u0027s very important,\" Harriet confided to Jill. But someone obviously did not think so, because a month later, Tony was found floating in the Los Angeles River with an apple stuffed in his mouth. Alex was Harriet\u0027s next love. \"He\u0027s the best-looking thing you\u0027ve ever seen,\" Harriet confided to Jill. Alex was handsome. He dressed in expensive clothes, drove a flashy convertible and spent a lot of time at the racetracks. The romance lasted until Harriet started running out of money. It angered Jill that Harriet had so little sense about men. \"I can\u0027t help it,\" Harriet confessed. \"I\u0027m attracted to guys who are in trouble. I think it\u0027s my mother instinct.\" She grinned and added, \"My mother was an idiot.\" Jill watched a procession of Harriet\u0027s fiances come and go. There was Nick and Bobby and John and Raymond, until finally Jill could no longer keep track of them. A few months after they had moved in together, Harriet announced that she was pregnant. \"I think it\u0027s Leonard,\" she quipped, \"but you know - they all look alike in the dark.\" \"Where is Leonard?\" \"He\u0027s either in Omaha or Okinawa. I always was lousy at geography.\" \"What are you going to do?\" \"I\u0027m going to have my baby.\" Because of her slight figure, Harriet\u0027s pregnancy became obvious in a matter of weeks and she had to give up her modeling job. Jill found a job in a supermarket so that she could support the two of them. One afternoon when Jill returned home from work, she found a note from Harriet. It read: \"I\u0027ve always wanted my baby to be born in Hoboken. Have gone back home to my folks. I\u0027ll bet there\u0027s a wonderful guy there, waiting for me. Thanks for everything.\" It was signed: \"Harriet, The Nun.\" The apartment had suddenly become a lonely place.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stranger-in-the-mirror/page-21.html","bookId":2355,"book":{"id":2355,"title":"A Stranger in the Mirror","description":"Storyline: A Stranger in the Mirror is a 1976 novel written by Sidney Sheldon.
