{"id":91918,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Afew hours later, my feet ached while my head kept spinning. My sense of duty kept me with George as we spent the morning shuttling between appointments and tailor fittings. I was now wearing linen pants and a white shirt from Savile Row, and had several more bags on my arms.\\n\\n Despite his generosity, I was desperate to escape George. Al I could think about while trying on various clothes was the girl\u0027s blood-soaked, ripped bodice.\\n\\n \"Can I give you a lift to your relatives? You never did say where they lived,\" George said as he stepped off the street corner to nod his head at a passing carriage.\\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s quite al right,\" I said, cutting him off as the coach pul ed up to the curb. The past few hours with George had been torturous, plagued with thoughts that would make his hair turn white and stand on end. I blamed Damon for poisoning what was supposed to have been nothing more than a day of pleasant persions.\\n\\n I glanced away so I wouldn\u0027t have to see George\u0027s bewildered expression. A few blocks away, I could just make out St. Paul\u0027s Cathedral. It was a structure I remembered sketching when I was a child and dreamt of being an architect. I\u0027d always imagined it as being white and gleaming, but in reality it was constructed of a dingy gray limestone. The entire city felt dirty, a thin layer of grime coated my body, and the sun was covered by gray clouds.\\n\\n Just then, the sky opened up and fat drops of rain landed on the pavement, as if reminding me this was my narrow chance to fol ow my instincts and flee from George.\\n\\n \"Sir?\" the coach driver on the curb urged impatiently.\\n\\n \"I\u0027l find my own way there,\" I said, sensing George\u0027s hesitation at leaving me. The coachman moved to escort George to the sleek black carriage.\\n\\n \"Enjoy yourself,\" George said, clambering up the steps of the coach. The coachman whipped his horse, and the carriage took off down the rain-soaked cobblestone streets.\\n\\n I glanced around me. In the few minutes that George and I had been talking, the streets had become almost deserted. I shivered in my fine shirt.\\n\\n The weather perfectly matched my mood.\\n\\n I raised my hand and hailed a coach of my own.\\n\\n \"Whitechapel,\" I said confidently, surprised as the words left my lips. I\u0027d thought of going to the Journeyman to find Damon. And I would do that, eventual y. But for now, I wanted to see for myself where the murder had taken place.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" the coachman said. And instantly, I was trotted into the maze of claustrophobic London streets.\\n\\n After much back and forth with the coachman, he dropped me on the corner where the Tower Bridge was being constructed. Glancing around, I could see the Tower of London. It was smal er than I\u0027d thought it would be, and the flags on its turrets didn\u0027t wave so much as droop in the constant trickle of rain. But I wasn\u0027t here to sightsee. I turned away from the river and onto Clothier Street, one of the many twisting, dirty, dank al eys that webbed through the city.\\n\\n I quickly realized this part of town was vastly different than what I\u0027d seen with George. Rotting vegetables cluttered the rain-slicked cobblestones. Thin, slanted buildings were shoddily thrown up almost on top of each other. The scent of iron was everywhere, although I couldn\u0027t tel whether the concentration of blood was from murder or simply from the mass of people forced to live in such close quarters. Pigeons hopped along the al eyways, but otherwise the area was deserted. I felt a shiver of fear creep up my spine as I hurried around the park and toward a tavern.\\n\\n I walked inside and into nearly complete darkness. Only a few candles burned on the rickety tables. A smal group of men were sitting along the bar. Meanwhile, several women were drinking in the corner. Their brightly colored dresses and festive hats were at odds with the gloomy surroundings, and gave them the look of caged birds at the zoo. No one seemed to be talking. I nervously adjusted the lapis lazuli ring on my finger, looking at the rainbow of refracted light the stone created on the gritty oak floor.\\n\\n I sidled up to the bar and perched on one of the stools. The air was heavy and damp. I unbuttoned the top button of my shirt and loosened my tie to counter the stifling atmosphere. I wrinkled my nose in disgust. It wasn\u0027t the type of establishment I\u0027d envision Damon frequenting.\\n\\n \"You one of them newspaper boys?\"\\n\\n I glanced up at the barkeep in front of me. One of his front teeth was gold, the other was missing, and his hair stuck out in wild gray tufts. I shook my head. I just have a taste for blood. The phrase popped into my mind. It was an off-color joke that Damon would have cracked. His favorite game was to almost give himself away, to see if anyone noticed. Of course they didn\u0027t. They were too busy being dazzled by Damon.\\n\\n \"Mate?\" the barkeep asked curiously, plunking a filthy rag on the bar as he looked at me. \"You one of them newspaper boys?\" he repeated.\\n\\n \"No. And I think I might not be in the right place. Is the Journeyman nearby?\" I asked, already knowing the answer.\\n\\n \"Ha! You \u0027avin\u0027 a laugh? The Journeyman is that right proper supper club. Only admits the toffs. Ain\u0027t our kind, and you won\u0027t get in neither, even with that fancy shirt. Only option is to drown your sorrows with some ale!\" He laughed, displaying one of his gold molars in the back of his mouth.\\n\\n \"So the Journeyman club isn\u0027t close?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No, mate. Close to the Strand, near al them shows. Where the fancy folks go when they want to get wild. But they come here when they want to get wicked!\" The barkeep laughed again as I glanced away, annoyed. I wasn\u0027t going to find Damon here. Unless . . .\\n\\n \"Beer, please. A dark ale,\" I said, suddenly inspired. Maybe I could get the barkeep to talk and find clues to who - or what - was responsible for Mary Ann\u0027s death. Because if it was Damon, either directly or indirectly, I\u0027d final y teach him the lesson he should have learned long ago. I wouldn\u0027t kil him or stake him. But if it came down to it and I had him on the ground, at my mercy, would I hurt him?\\n\\n Yes. I was immediately certain of my answer.\\n\\n \"What?\" the barkeep asked, and I realized I\u0027d spoken out loud.\\n\\n \"Just that I\u0027d like that ale,\" I said, forcing a pleasant expression.\\n\\n \"Al right, friend,\" the barkeep said amiably as he shuffled to one of the many taps that lined the back of the bar.\\n\\n \"Here you go.\" The barkeep pushed a glass of frothy brew toward me.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I said, tipping the glass toward me as though I were drinking. But I just barely let the liquid cross my lips. I needed to keep my wits.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re not a newspaper boy, but you\u0027re not from around here, are you?\" the bartender asked, leaning his elbows on the bar and gazing at me curiously with his bloodshot gray eyes.\\n\\n Since I spoke to so few people, except for the Abbotts, I forgot that my Virginia accent instantaneously gave me away. \"From America,\" I said briefly.\\n\\n \"And you came here? To Whitechapel?\" the barkeep asked incredulously. \"You know we have a murderer on the loose!\"\\n\\n \"I think I read something about that in the paper,\" I said, trying to sound casual. \"Who do they think it is?\" At this, the barkeep guffawed, slamming his beefy fist on the bar and almost causing my drink to tip over. \"You hear that?\" he cal ed to the motley crew of men on the other side of the bar, who al seemed deep into their drinks. \"He wants to know who the murderer is!\" At this, the other men laughed, too.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry?\" I asked in confusion.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just having a laugh,\" the barkeep said jovial y. \"It\u0027s not some bloke who pinched a purse. This is an unholy kil er. If any of us knew who it was, don\u0027t you think we\u0027d go straight to Scotland Yard or the City of London police and let them know? It\u0027s bad for business! That monster has al our girls half-terrified!\" He lowered his voice and glanced at the cluster of women in the corner. \"And between you and me, I don\u0027t think any of us are safe.\\n\\n He\u0027s going for the girls now, but who\u0027s to say he won\u0027t go for us next? He takes his knife and like that, you\u0027re gone,\" he said, drawing his index finger across his throat for emphasis.\\n\\n It doesn\u0027t have to be a knife, I wanted to say. I kept my gaze locked on the barkeep.\\n\\n \"But he doesn\u0027t start at the neck. Why, he cut that girl\u0027s innards right out. He likes to torture. He\u0027s looking for blood,\" he said.\\n\\n At the mention of the word, my tongue automatical y slicked over my teeth. They were stil short and even. Human. \"Do they have any leads? The murder sounds gruesome.\" I grimaced.\\n\\n \"Wel . . .\" The barkeep lowered his voice and raised his eyebrow at me. \"First off, you promise you ain\u0027t from one of those papers? Not the Guardian or them other ones?\"\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \"Good. I\u0027m Alfred, by the way,\" the barkeep said, reaching out his hand to me. I shook it, not offering my name in return. He continued, hardly noticing. \"I know the life we live here doesn\u0027t seem prim and proper like what you might be used to across the ocean,\" he said, taking in my brand-new Savile Row outfit, which made me wildly overdressed for this establishment. \"But we like our way of life. And our women,\" he added, waggling his salt-and-pepper eyebrows.\\n\\n \"The women . . .\" I said. I remembered the article had said that the victim had been a woman of the night. Just the type of woman Damon had enjoyed at one point. I shivered in disgust.\\n\\n \"Yes, the women,\" Alfred said grimly. \"Not the types of ladies you\u0027re going to meet at church, if you know what I mean.\"\\n\\n \"But the type of women you pray to meet in bed!\" guffawed a ruddy-complexioned man two seats down, holding up his whiskey glass in a mock toast.\\n\\n \"None of that talk! We\u0027re a respectable establishment!\" the barkeep said, a wicked spark in his eye. He turned his back to me and fil ed two glasses with several inches of amber liquid. He then turned and ceremoniously placed one in front of me.\\n\\n \"For you. Liquid courage. You need it around these parts, what with the murderer walking the streets,\" Alfred said, clinking his glass with mine.\\n\\n \"Although my best advice is to stay here until sunrise. Maybe meet a nice lady. Better than meeting the Ripper.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027The Ripper\u0027?\"\\n\\n Alfred smiled. \"That\u0027s what they\u0027re cal ing him. Because he doesn\u0027t just kil , he butchers. I\u0027m tel ing you, stay here for your own protection.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said uneasily. I wasn\u0027t sure if I wanted to stay. The smel of iron hadn\u0027t lessened in my time in the bar, and I was growing increasingly sure it was emanating from the wal s and floor. The man in the corner kept staring at me, and I found myself staring back, trying to see any glimpse of fangs or blood-flecked chins. I could hear the women behind me whispering, and I wondered what they were discussing.\\n\\n \"Did Mary Ann . . . the most recent murder victim . . . did she ever drink here?\" I asked hopeful y. If I couldn\u0027t find Damon, then I\u0027d just do the next best thing and find out al I could about Damon\u0027s victim.\\n\\n \"Rest in peace,\" the barkeep said reverential y. \"She was a good girl. Came in from time to time, when she had enough pennies for gin. This ain\u0027t a charity, and the girls al knew they needed to pay the proper fee in order to spend time here. It was a system that worked out. The locals left the girls alone while they were out on the streets, unless they were striking a bargain. The girls respected the rules of the bar. And now, everything\u0027s fal en apart. If I ever find the bloke who did it, I\u0027l rip his throat out,\" Alfred said savagely, pounding his fist against the table.\\n\\n \"But did she leave with anyone, or was there ever a man you saw her with?\" I pressed.\\n\\n \"I saw her with a lot of men over the years. But none that stood out. Most of \u0027em were the blokes who worked down by the docks. Rough types, but none that would do that. Those blokes aren\u0027t looking for any trouble, just a good pint and a good girl. Besides, she left by herself that night.\\n\\n Sometimes, when there\u0027s too many girls here, they go out to the streets. Less competition,\" he explained, noticing my confused expression. \"But before she left, she\u0027d had a good night here. She had some gin, a few laughs. Was wearing a new hat she was so proud of. Felt like it drew the men over to her. The good kind, too, not the ones who only pretend to have money. I wish she\u0027d stayed, God bless her,\" Alfred said, raising his eyes piously to the ceiling.\\n\\n \"And her body . . .\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Wel , now, the body was found in Dutfield Park. It\u0027s where the ladies sometimes go when they can\u0027t afford a room. I don\u0027t say nothin\u0027, whatever goes on outside the premises ain\u0027t my business. But that\u0027s where he got her and slit her throat.\" I nodded, my mind racing back to one of the many overgrown squares of grass that dotted the area. The weeds, garbage, and peeling paint of the iron fences surrounding the parks al made the area seem more dismal than simple city squares.\\n\\n \"And if you are one of them newspaper boys, then I didn\u0027t say nothing. What\u0027s your name anyway, boy?\" Alfred asked.\\n\\n \"Stefan,\" I said, taking a huge swig of whiskey. It did nothing to calm the dread in my stomach. A soul ess kil er was loose, and he would stop at nothing.\\n\\n \"Wel , Stefan, welcome to Whitechapel,\" he said, raising his second glass. \"And remember, better whiskey down your throat than the murderer on it.\"\\n\\n I smiled tightly as I held up a glass to my new friend.\\n\\n \"Here, here!\" one of the drunk men at the other end of the bar said. I smiled at him, fervently hoping that too many whiskeys drunk at the pub wouldn\u0027t lead them al to their doom.\\n\\n The devil you know is better than the devil you don\u0027t. The phrase floated into my mind. It was one that Lexi would often invoke, and it was one I\u0027d only found to be more and more true as time passed. Because as horrid and soul ess as the crime was, if Damon had done it, at least I wouldn\u0027t have any other vampires to worry about. But the longer I stayed at the bar, the more another thought tugged at my brain: What if it wasn\u0027t Damon, but another vampire?\\n\\n Down at the other end of the bar, Alfred had drifted into conversation with a few of the other customers. Rain pelted against the windows, and I was reminded of the fox den at the far side of the Abbotts\u0027 farm. Entire families of beasts huddled there, waiting for the moment when they thought it was safe to head into the forest. The unlucky ones would be hit by a hunter\u0027s bul et.\\n\\n I glanced around again. A woman in a lilac dress al owed her hand to slide down a man\u0027s shoulder. The real question was, who were the foxes and who were the hunters? Al I could hope was that I was a hunter.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-4.html","bookId":2112,"book":{"id":2112,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #4) \\n The year is 1888, and the scent of blood lingers heavy in the London air.
