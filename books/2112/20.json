Every inch of my body hurt, as though hot pokers were sticking into my skin. My mouth tasted like sandpaper, and my limbs felt like lead.\n In my half-conscious state, I didn\u0027t know where I was, but I had the familiar feeling I\u0027d been here before. But where? If I was in hel , at least it was quiet. But then I blinked, and noticed two points of light moving toward me.\n \"Wel , hel o there,\" a voice said. I blinked again, and realized the two points of light were coming from two large, inquisitive eyes.\n \"Katherine,\" I croaked.\n \"Why, yes,\" she said, as though we were meeting each other on the dust-covered dirt road to Veritas Estate.\n \"This is a dream,\" I said, more to myself than to her.\n \"It could be,\" she said, her tone of voice light, as if I\u0027d asked if she thought it might rain later that day. \"But does it matter? We\u0027re both here.\"\n \"Why is this happening?\"\n \"Some people can\u0027t let go. It can be difficult, can\u0027t it?\" Katherine asked rhetorical y.\n I glanced at her eyes. They were wide, catlike, and more beautiful than ever. I remembered the hours I spent staring into them, back when I was wil ing to risk it al for her. And I had. I\u0027d lost everything. But stil , those eyes reminded me of what it felt like to be young and believe that love conquered al .\n I wanted to ask her why she\u0027d turned me, when she must have known that my life would be fil ed with sorrow. I wanted to know how she stood it. I wanted to know what I was supposed to do, now that I had lost everyone I cared about. And I wanted to know why she continued to haunt me.\n \"Scholarly Stefan,\" Katherine said, a smile playing on her lips. \"Always thinking too hard. But remember, some things can\u0027t be understood or explained. They have to be experienced.\"\n \"Why?\" I shouted, but Katherine simply faded into the darkness.\n \"We need to go,\" Damon said brusquely, poking my ribs with the tip of his boot.\n \"Now?\" I struggled to my elbows before wiping sleep from my eyes. I knew from the dew on the ground that it was only a matter of time before the sky ful y burst into morning.\n Damon nodded. Cora stood a few paces away, her brow furrowed and arms crossed as she silently studied us.\n \"We\u0027re going back to London,\" Damon said firmly. \"I need to find Samuel and teach him a lesson. No one bests Damon Salvatore. I\u0027m going to beat him at his own game.\"\n \"We can\u0027t go back to London,\" I said, my jaw clenched as I rose to my ful height, standing eye to eye with my brother. \"Don\u0027t you see that? We need to stop fighting. You used to hate me; now you hate Samuel. It\u0027l just lead to more bloodshed. Don\u0027t you understand?\"\n \"Oh, I understand, brother. I understand you\u0027d rather get yourself kil ed than say thanks to the brother who saved your life. I\u0027m going to London. If you want to live in darkness and survive on sheep and rabbits, go ahead.\"\n \"I\u0027m going, too. I have to find Violet,\" Cora said, her face pale and drawn. A glance passed between Cora and Damon, but I had no idea what it meant. Final y, Damon nodded.\n \"I\u0027l come,\" I said. It wasn\u0027t as if I could stay here. Violet was out on her own, and I had to do everything I could to honor her dying wish. I couldn\u0027t let her become a monster. And Damon needed me, whether he knew it or not. And right now, when I had no one and no home, as much as I hated to admit it, I needed him.\n I took off, leading the way through the forest to the train station. In the distance, I could hear a whistle. Freedom was only a few paces away. I sped up.\n \"And this time, no excuses for who you are, Stefan,\" Damon said, catching up to me, Cora on his back. \"You\u0027re a vampire. When wil you realize that?\"\n \"I know who I am, Damon,\" I said calmly. It was a variation of the same argument we always had, but this time, I wasn\u0027t going to fight. I could see the train chugging into the station. We had to be careful. I was sure the entire parish was looking for us, and if we weren\u0027t ready to compel at a moment\u0027s notice, we could be caught unaware. \"I\u0027m your brother.\"\n \"Yes,\" Damon said after a beat.\n It wasn\u0027t anywhere close to an apology, but I sensed something between us shift. If we wanted to find Samuel, we needed to work together.\n Maybe fighting Samuel was our only chance to stop the bloodshed that fol owed us. I had to believe it. I had to believe in something.\n \"Did you know that Samuel was a vampire?\" I asked. It was a smal question, but one I\u0027d wondered in my feverish sleep. Had Damon voluntarily found a vampire society in London?\n \"No, I didn\u0027t know.\" Damon shook his head, his dark eyes glinting in anger. \"But I do know that I wil never be made a fool of again. And I also know that Samuel\u0027s about to get a lesson he\u0027l never forget.\"\n \"What if he\u0027s an Original?\" I asked, my voice dropping to a whisper.\n I cast my eyes to the sky, hoping that if there was light and goodness anywhere in the world, that Oliver was somewhere safe, in a place where he could do al the hunting he wanted.\n \"\u0027What if he\u0027s an Original?\u0027\" Damon mocked, pul ing me out of my reverie. \"What does it matter? The only thing that matters is strength and determination. The Salvatore way,\" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Ready?\" he asked, turning to Cora with a hint of a spark in his eye.\n With Damon, it was impossible to tel what he was thinking.\n \"Al aboard!\" the conductor said, waving us on. I tried not to imagine what he must think of the three of us: Damon with his ripped shirt; me with my chest wound oozing through my shirt; and Cora, stil wearing her ever-present scarf tied in a dainty bow around her neck, despite her bloodstained bodice.\n \"Tickets?\" the conductor asked suspiciously.\n Damon smiled, his shoulders relaxing, clearly in his element.\n \"London. You\u0027ve already seen our tickets, so you\u0027l escort us to a first-class cabin. We won\u0027t see you for the rest of the trip. As far as you or anyone else is concerned, we\u0027re not there.\"\n \"Yes, sir, of course,\" the conductor said, nodding and ushering us through a narrow path onto the train.\n I stared out the window as the verdant greenery rushed by. I wondered what was waiting for us in London. Would Samuel go on another kil ing spree? Did Violet real y go with him wil ingly, or had she simply been bewildered after her transformation? And could Damon and I ever real y work together?\n Al I knew was we were two revenge-seeking vampires, and we were about to bring on Samuel\u0027s destruction - no matter what the cost might be. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-20.html","bookId":2112,"book":{"id":2112,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #4) \n The year is 1888, and the scent of blood lingers heavy in the London air.
