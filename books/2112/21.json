{"id":91935,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Twenty years ago - almost a lifetime ago - my brother and I escaped Mystic Falls on a train headed for New Orleans. We were baby vampires ourselves then. Damon was confused and searching, and I was blood-drunk and ready for action. Now our roles had reversed. And yet, whether bound by a shared history or loyalty or even by blood - that mysterious, vexing, life-giving - substance - we were together. We didn\u0027t trust each other. We didn\u0027t like each other. But we were each other, reflecting our shadow, secret selves in the other\u0027s identity. We were running from a small-town mob that was after me, toward an entire city that believed Damon to be the deadliest murderer in history. We were in it together. And we deserved each other. As much as I tried to hide it, I had a deadly dark side. And I saw, in Damon\u0027s concerned glances toward Cora and the gentle way he\u0027d cradled Oliver\u0027s body as he brought him to me for burial, that Damon had a deeply feeling, human side. But could the two ever exist in tandem? And how many more humans would be killed before we could live in peace as vampires? I didn\u0027t know the answer. But I knew there would be many more deaths. All I could hope was that they wouldn\u0027t be by my own hand. . . .","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-21.html","bookId":2112,"book":{"id":2112,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #4) The year is 1888, and the scent of blood lingers heavy in the London air.
