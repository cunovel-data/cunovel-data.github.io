{"id":91921,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"In the light of day, the winding London streets didn\u0027t seem nearly as intimidating as they had during my wild run the night before. Carriages filed the roads, peddlers on the corners hawked everything from flowers to newspapers to tobacco, and a cacophony of languages made it impossible to pick out any distinct conversations. I walked east, fol owing the flow of the Thames, the river that had become my North Star in orienting myself in London. The dark and murky water looked foreboding, as though it had secrets buried far beneath its surface. I wished I could just take Violet and leave this city. I could keep her safe for now, but how long would that last? Al I could think of was the look of terror on Violet\u0027s face, her smal voice, the strength she had to leave her family in Ireland to fol ow her dream. She had a courageous streak that Rosalyn hadn\u0027t, but her youthful innocence made me nostalgic for the time when I was her age. It was my fault she had lost her room and board and I wanted to protect her in any way I could. People are our downfall. Interacting with them is what undoes us. Your heart is too soft. It had been something Lexi told me many times over the years. I\u0027d always nod, but sometimes I\u0027d question why. Because while it was easy enough to avoid humans when I was in the company of Lexi, I seemed to instinctively seek out their company when I was by myself. And why was that so wrong? Just because I was a monster didn\u0027t mean that I no longer valued companionship. So when will my heart harden? I\u0027d asked, impatient. She\u0027d laughed. I hope it won\u0027t. It\u0027s the part of you that keeps you human. I suppose that\u0027s your blessing and your curse. As I walked to Whitechapel, I stopped midway in St. James Park, my thirst growing. I knew if I was heading back to the tavern, I would have to be at my strongest. Unlike the nightmarish Dutfield Park from last night, this field was sprawling and lush, ful of ponds and trees and pedestrians enjoying impromptu picnics. It was vast; but at first glance stil seemed smal er than Central Park in New York City, where I\u0027d once spent several hungry weeks foraging for food. Clouds had once again rol ed into the sky, bathing the whole city in darkness. It was only noon, but there was no sign of the sun. The air felt wet and heavy with rain, despite the lack of actual drops. It was never like this in Ivinghoe. The weather there seemed more honest, somehow. When it looked like it would rain, it rained. Here, nothing was as it seemed. I sniffed the air. Even though I couldn\u0027t see them, I knew animals were everywhere, hiding under the brush or scampering in tunnels just beneath the grass. I headed toward a dense col ection of trees, hoping I could capture a bird or a squirrel without anyone noticing. A disturbance in the bushes caused me to stiffen. Without thinking, I used my vampire reflexes to reach into them, trapping a fat gray squirrel in my hands. Relying only on instinct, I sunk my teeth into the tiny creature\u0027s neck and sucked out its blood, trying not to gag. City squirrels tasted different than country squirrels, and this one had watery, bitter-tasting blood. Stil , it would have to do. I threw the carcass into the bushes and wiped my mouth. Suddenly, I heard a rustle coming from the far end of the forest. I whirled around, half-expecting to see Klaus, ready for a fight. Nothing. I sighed, my stomach final y quieting now that it was satiated. And now that I was prepared, I headed to the Ten Bel s Tavern, ready to compel Alfred into giving Violet her job back. As expected, the air smel ed musty and sharp, like the scent of ale mixed with unwashed human bodies. \"Alfred?\" I cal ed, my eyes once again adjusting to the near nighttime blackness of the bar. I wasn\u0027t looking forward to speaking to him. He was loathsome, and even though my compel ing would ensure Violet would be treated kindly, I hated the thought of her returning here. But I knew it was the best thing for her. Because the more she became involved with me, the more danger she\u0027d be in. That was something I knew as clearly as the message written in blood on the wal . \"Alfred?\" I cal ed again, just as he emerged from the kitchen, wiping his hands on his pants. His cheeks were red and his eyes were bloodshot. \"Stefan. Violet\u0027s bloke. I s\u0027pose now you decided you\u0027re done with her? We don\u0027t do refunds,\" he said flatly, leaning his meaty arms against the bar. \"She\u0027s a friend,\" I said. I stepped toward him, making sure to keep eye contact, and keeping my fingers and palms flexed to avoid lashing out. I hated him. \"And I have something I need to discuss.\" \"What?\" he asked suspiciously. \"Take Violet back,\" I said level y. \"She\u0027s a hard worker, and she needs her job and room.\" Alfred nodded, but didn\u0027t open his mouth to speak. \"Just like her sister. Takes off with the first man who looks at her nicely. Bloody fools if you ask me. Mary Ann, now she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but Violet . . .\" \"Wil you do that?\" I prompted. I wanted to fol ow his conversational thread, but I couldn\u0027t stop in the middle of compel ing. In the past twenty-four hours, I\u0027d compel ed more than I had in the past twenty years, and I wasn\u0027t as confident in my Power as I used to be. \"And when you do, you won\u0027t lay a hand on her. You\u0027l protect her. Just bring Violet back.\" \"Bring Violet back,\" he said slowly, as if in a trance. \"Yes,\" I said, relieved by the confirmation. Just then, the bel of the tavern tinkled and a large man lurched in, clearly stil drunk from the night before. Alfred looked up at the commotion, breaking the spel and ruining my chance to ask questions: What man had Cora gone off with? And what else did Alfred know? \"You\u0027l see Violet tomorrow night,\" I said to Alfred\u0027s retreating back, as though we were just having a chat. I pul ed up a stool to the bar, waiting for when he\u0027d be free. The door opened again and a woman sauntered in, wearing an indigo dress that clearly showed the expansive whiteness of her bosom. I recognized her as the woman who\u0027d come up to me last night. This time, I was glad to speak with her. She had a large beauty mark above her red-painted lips, and her hair hung in bright blond ringlets under a black-feather-adorned hat. She was short and squat, but carried herself with the confidence of a woman far more beautiful. Immediately, her beady eyes locked on mine. \"Hel o, there,\" she said, walking unsteadily up to me. \"Me name\u0027s Eliza.\" She held out her hand for me to kiss. I recoiled. Even though I\u0027d just fed, the thin squirrel blood was not enough to satisfy my deeper thirst, and her exposed flesh was almost more than I could bear. I could smel her blood and could almost imagine its rich, sugar-sweet flavor coating my tongue. I pressed my lips together and stared at the dusty cracks between the floorboards. \"I tried to talk to you last night,\" she continued, al owing her hand to flutter to my shoulder as though dusting off an imaginary speck of lint. \"But you only had eyes for that girl. I thought she was so lucky, speaking with a handsome young lad like you. I hope you enjoyed her,\" she leered. \"I didn\u0027t. \" I stepped away, hating her insinuation. \"Violet is just a friend,\" I said coldly. \"Wel , do you need someone who\u0027s more than a friend?\" she asked, batting her dark eyelashes. \"No! I need to know . . .\" I glanced toward Alfred, but he was far down at the other end of the bar, busy playing a game of dice with the drunk man. Stil , I lowered my voice. \"I need to know more about the murderer.\" \"You one of them coppers?\" she asked suspiciously. \"Because I told \u0027em before, I don\u0027t do discounts and I don\u0027t give out information on me friends neither. Not for al the gin in China.\" I shook my head at her mangled expression. \"I\u0027m just concerned. Especial y now. Apparently another woman is missing. Do you know Cora? She works here.\" For Violet\u0027s sake, I only hoped that Cora was alive. \"Cora?\" The woman\u0027s face transformed into a grimace. \"Why, she was the barmaid, right? Always thought she was so uppity and better than us, but Lord knows she was doing the same thing we was. Seems like she was just waiting for the right price,\" the woman said indignantly. \"Do you mean she left with a man?\" I asked urgently. It was clear that this woman had been keeping a very close eye on Cora, and I hoped that would translate into a clue as to her whereabouts. The woman nodded. \"The same man who I\u0027d been trying al night to be sweet on me. He was handsome. Said he was a producer or an actor at the Gaiety. One of them theater types. Funny sounding, though. A bit like you,\" she added uncertainly. \"He had an accent?\" I asked, unable to contain my excitement. I didn\u0027t want to jump to conclusions, but I doubted there were many frequenters of the Ten Bel s who had a Southern drawl like mine. Maybe Damon had been here. And maybe, just maybe, he knew I was in town. Maybe that was why the message had been written on the wal . It hadn\u0027t been Klaus at al , only one of Damon\u0027s stupid traps to lure me into a cat-and-mouse chase. \"You got me going al hoarse. If we\u0027re going to talk any more, you\u0027ve got to get me a drink,\" Eliza said, yanking me from my reverie. \"Double gin, please,\" she said, her eyes gleaming greedily. \"Of course,\" I said. I went to the bar and came back with a gin and a whiskey. I licked my lips as I watched Eliza take a swig. I took a careful sip of my own drink. Although I didn\u0027t want to get drunk, alcohol occasional y tempered my cravings for blood. I hoped it would this time. I needed something to distract me from Eliza\u0027s neck. I took another large gulp of whiskey. \"There, that\u0027s better. Nothing beats a spot of gin in the afternoon, don\u0027t you agree, love?\" she asked, already appearing in a much better mood. \"Wel , he was talkin\u0027 funny. Not like he bothered to say much to me,\" she added darkly. \"He talked to her al night. I walked by a couple times. Said he\u0027d bring her to the theater, show her around. Maybe get her an audition. Men say whatever pops in their heads to get a woman to go to bed,\" Eliza said in disgust. \"Do you remember his name? Did he have any distinctive features? Was he intimidating her?\" I asked, barraging her with questions as dread rippled through my stomach. \"I don\u0027t know! Like I said, he didn\u0027t even want to talk to me!\" she said indignantly. \"And I s\u0027pose it\u0027s a good thing, especial y with them murders going on. Maybe it\u0027s best we stick with the blokes we know, even if they stiff us for our money when they can\u0027t . . .\" She broke off and glanced at me, her eyes chal enging me to get her salty innuendo. \"But what did he look like?\" I asked, barely listening to what she was saying. Her eyes cut toward me suspiciously. \"Oh, you\u0027re stil thinking about him? I don\u0027t know. Elegant. Tal . Dirty blond hair. But since Cora\u0027s body didn\u0027t show up in a ditch or nothin\u0027, they\u0027re probably just enjoying each other\u0027s company,\" she added darkly. Dirty blond hair? I frowned. Damon\u0027s hair was dark. It was the first clue that hadn\u0027t been a perfect match. Of course, it wasn\u0027t as if Eliza was necessarily the most reliable eyewitness. I decided to keep focusing on what else she had to say. \"Or maybe he real y was one of those producers she always talked about. Wel , la dee da for her. Then she\u0027d always be thinking she was better than any of us,\" Eliza added. \"Were you close with Mary Ann?\" I asked, changing the subject to the murder victim. Eliza sighed and flicked her gaze away from me, toward the motley col ection of men who\u0027d fil ed the bar since we\u0027d begun talking. Since it was clear I wasn\u0027t interested in propositioning her, she was obviously looking for someone who would. Not seeing any targets, she glanced back at me. \"Mary Ann was me friend. At least she was before she went and got herself kil ed,\" Eliza said, a cloud of anger crossing her face. \"Although, what do you expect?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Wel , she was me friend, and I\u0027d\u0027a said this to her face if I\u0027d gotten the chance. She was one of them types. Took risks. Caroused with bad men. I don\u0027t even remember who she left with. After they found her, al cut up and kil ed, the police came in the tavern. Who did she go with, they asked. What did she say as she was leaving? And the answer was, we saw nothing, we heard nothing, and if she\u0027d\u0027a only told us who she was going off with, we might have been able to avoid him in the future!\" Eliza shuddered, and I couldn\u0027t help noticing her heaving bosom. I glanced away, but not before she caught me staring. She smiled lasciviously. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to continue this conversation in private?\" she asked, suggestively licking her lower lip. \"I\u0027m sure!\" I said forceful y, standing up so quickly the rickety chair behind me toppled over. \"You\u0027re lovely, of course, but I can\u0027t,\" I said. \"I can give you a deal. Foreigner\u0027s special!\" she said, wiggling her eyebrows. \"I have to go,\" I said firmly. I reached into my pocket and found a few florins. \"These are for you. Please don\u0027t go off with anyone,\" I said. I dropped the coins into her hand. Her eyes gleamed as she took the money. \"You sure I can\u0027t give you a little something?\" \"That won\u0027t be necessary.\" I scraped my chair back and strode out of the tavern. As soon as I walked out, I stumbled, and immediately realized the whiskey had gone to my head. But I had a clue that would lead me to Cora and Damon. \"You there!\" I whirled around. The drunk man who\u0027d been at the bar when I came in lurched toward me, the scent of stale gin on his breath. \"What?\" I asked. \"I know who you are,\" he said, swaying closer and closer toward me. \"And I have my eye on you!\" At this, he laughed maniacal y, then staggered backward against a brick wal . Fear buzzed in my brain. I looked down at him, stil laughing in a drunken heap. What did he mean, he knew who I was? Was it just the ramblings of a drunk, or was it another clue that my arrival in London hadn\u0027t been unnoticed?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-7.html","bookId":2112,"book":{"id":2112,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #4) The year is 1888, and the scent of blood lingers heavy in the London air.
