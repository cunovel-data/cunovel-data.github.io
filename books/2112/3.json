{"id":91917,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The next morning, George and I were settled in a lavish train car on our way to London. I leaned back in the plush chair, alowing waves of nausea to ride over me. I knew from past experiences that cities could be too loud, too heavy with the scent of unwashed bodies, too tempting. So in preparation, I\u0027d drunk the blood of a skunk and a hare, and now felt sick. But better sick than starving, especial y since I wanted to put my best foot forward when we met with George\u0027s solicitor. I knew it was an honor for him to invite me to meet his associate, a man who\u0027d look over the numbers from the farm and advise us if there was anything we needed to do differently when it came to staffing and purchasing. And yet, I simply couldn\u0027t shake the image of Katherine from my nightmare. So instead of talking, I merely nodded as George wondered aloud whether or not we should lease out our horses to the mine at the other side of Ivinghoe. It was impossible to shift from life and death to the minutiae of human existence. In another twenty years - ten even - none of it would matter. The velvet curtain of our compartment opened, and a porter popped his head in. \"Tea or newspaper?\" he asked, holding out a silver tray piled high with scones and teacakes. Mr. Abbott eyed them hungrily as the porter placed tea and two raisin scones on pristine china plates and then passed one to each of us. \"You can have mine,\" I said, handing the plate over to Mr. Abbott. \"We\u0027l take the newspaper as wel .\" \"Right, sir.\" The porter nodded and passed me a copy of the Daily Telegraph. Immediately, I pul ed out the pages I enjoyed, handing George the features he loved while I kept the sports and society pages for myself. It was an odd combination, but it had been my habit for the past twenty years, whenever I found myself in a city, to read the society news. I wanted to look for any mention of Count DeSangue, the name that Damon had used in New York. I wondered if he\u0027d given up his airs and grandiose posturing. I hoped so. The last time I saw him, his showiness had nearly led to our demise. It was far better for us both to go under the radar. Bram Stoker and Henry Irving open new play at the Lyceum . . . Sir Charles Ainsley invites guests to his West End House . . . Samuel Mortimer rumored to be running for London Councillor . . . dashing Count DeSangue seen out on the town at the supper club the Journeyman with lovely lady of the stage Charlotte Dumont. I felt my stomach clench with recognition. It was exactly as I expected. Seeing the words was a clear sign that Damon was stil haunting me; a sign I couldn\u0027t attribute to my dream, an overactive imagination, or too much sherry the night before. Because even though Damon hated me more than anything, it didn\u0027t change the fact that I was his brother. I\u0027d known him my whole life. As children, I could sense that he\u0027d have a fight with Father even before it happened. There would be tension crackling in the air, as evident as clouds before a storm. I could tel when he was angry, even if he was smiling at al our friends, and I always knew when he was frightened, even though he\u0027d never, ever say it. Even as vampires, something deep within me was stil connected to his moods. And whether he knew it or not, he was in trouble. I scanned the rest of the column, but that was the only mention of Damon. The rest was about lords and dukes and earls, which must have been Damon\u0027s newest set. Not that I was surprised. London, with its endless parties and cosmopolitan atmosphere, had always struck me as a place Damon could end up. Human or demon, he\u0027d always cut an impressive figure. And whether I liked it or not, he was my brother. The same blood ran through our veins. If I felt a pul toward England, wouldn\u0027t it make sense that he would, too? I glanced down at the paper again. Who was Charlotte Dumont? And where was the Journeyman? Maybe, if I had time in London after the solicitor\u0027s appointment, I\u0027d head out on my own to find it. It would at least lay my uneasy feelings to rest. After al , I was sure he was drinking Charlotte Dumont\u0027s blood, but if that was the extent of Damon\u0027s misbehavior, who was I to say anything? And if he was doing something worse, wel . . . I\u0027d cross that bridge when I came to it. Across from me, George was stabbing his knife into the pat of butter. What he had in wealth and land, he lacked in table manners. But instead of repulsing me, his boorish behavior yanked me out of my head. Our eyes caught, and I sensed George appraising my grass-stained blue shirt and black slacks. They were the nicest clothes I owned, but I knew they made me look like a laborer. \"I think while we\u0027re in town, I might take you to my tailor. Have some suits made,\" George mused. \"Thank you, sir,\" I mumbled. We were getting closer to the city, and the scenery had changed from wide expanses of open land to clusters of low-roofed houses. \"But I\u0027d actual y like to explore the city on my own after the meeting. You see, I have some relations in London. If it\u0027s al right with you, I\u0027d like to take a few days to see them. I\u0027l be sure to mend that fence at the far end of the pasture as soon as I return,\" I lied. I\u0027d never asked for days off. If George showed an ounce of hesitation, then I wouldn\u0027t go. But if he gave me his blessing, it was almost as if Fate was forcing me to find my brother. \"Wel , why didn\u0027t you say something earlier, boy?\" George boomed. \"I was worried about you, al alone in the world. It\u0027s always good to have relations, even if you don\u0027t get on with them. Because at the end of the day, you share a name; you share blood. It\u0027s good to know what they\u0027re up to.\" \"I suppose, sir,\" I said nervously. We were treading into dangerous territory. I\u0027d never given him my real last name. Instead, he knew me as Stefan Pine. I\u0027d chosen Pine not only because of its simplicity, but because I privately liked the idea of comparing myself to a pine tree: ever unchanging. It was a personal concession to my true nature. And so, I suppose, was Damon\u0027s personal choice of sobriquet. \"Take a week,\" George said. \"Thank you, but that won\u0027t be necessary on any count. I\u0027m only planning to cal on my relatives for tea. And that\u0027s only if I can find them. But I do thank you,\" I said awkwardly. \"I\u0027l tel you what,\" George said, leaning in toward me conspiratorial y. \"I\u0027l bring you to my tailor, buy you some suits, and you can impress the hel out of your relatives.\" \"No, th - \" I stopped myself. \"Yes, I\u0027d like that,\" I said firmly. After al , Damon was always so concerned with appearances that I wanted to beat him at his own game. I wanted him to see me as a man who\u0027d made a proud life. Damon could lie and cheat his way into any social circle, but it took hard work to develop trust with humans, and I had done just that. Maybe I could even serve as a good example, a subtle reminder to Damon that he didn\u0027t have to live a life devoid of meaning. \"It\u0027s the least I can do, son,\" George said, before we lapsed again into silence. The only noise in our cabin was the rhythmic chugging of the train and the smacking of George\u0027s lips. I sighed. I felt suddenly constrained in our cabin, and wished I were in the barn on the edge of the Manor, alone with my thoughts. \"Quiet today, aren\u0027t you? You were last night, too,\" George said, breaking the silence. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and pul ed the newspaper onto his lap. \"I suppose I am. I have a lot on my mind,\" I began. That might wel have been the understatement of the year. This morning, al I\u0027d been able to think about was Katherine. And now, the idea of Damon being so close was driving me to distraction. George nodded, an understanding expression in his watery blue eyes. \"You don\u0027t need to tel me about it. I know al men have secrets, but please know that you have a friend in me,\" George said seriously. Although he knew only a skeleton of my history - that I\u0027d left my father and America because I didn\u0027t want to marry the woman he\u0027d chosen for me - something about his countenance made me want to open up to him a little bit more than I had. \"Of course, I\u0027m not prying about your personal affairs,\" George said as he hastily rearranged the newspaper on his lap. \"No, you\u0027re not prying at al , sir. I thank you for your interest. The truth is, I have felt unsettled recently,\" I said final y, choosing my words careful y. \"Unsettled?\" George asked in concern. \"Is the job not to your liking? I know that it\u0027s a bit below your former station in America, but do know that I\u0027m watching you, and I think that you real y do have promise. Grow into yourself, get a few years under your belt, and I could see you going far. Perhaps you could even buy a piece of property yourself,\" George mused. I shook my head quickly. \"It\u0027s not the job,\" I said. \"I\u0027m grateful for the opportunity, and am pleased to be on the farm. It\u0027s . . . I\u0027ve been having nightmares about my past. I sometimes wonder . . . whether or not I can ever truly leave that part of my life behind. I sometimes think of my father\u0027s disappointment,\" I explained nervously. It was the most I\u0027d ever opened up to any human except Cal ie. And yet I felt relieved saying the sentences, even though they didn\u0027t nearly explore the chasm-like depths of my problems. \"Growing pains.\" Mr. Abbott nodded sagely. \"I remember having them, too, when my father was urging me to fol ow in his footsteps, eager to have someone carry on the name, his legacy. He was the one who told me that I\u0027d marry Gertrude and that I\u0027d run the farm. I did it, and I don\u0027t regret it. But what I do regret is that I never had a choice. Fact is, it\u0027s the life I would have chosen. But I think al men need to feel they\u0027re masters of their decisions.\" At this, Mr. Abbott smiled wistful y. \"That\u0027s why I admire you, Stefan. Standing up for your principles and setting out on your own. This is a remarkable age. We\u0027re no longer a society based on who we are, but rather what we do. And everything I\u0027ve seen you do has been exemplary,\" he said, taking a large bite of his scone, causing crumbs to scatter al over his shirt. \"Thank you,\" I said, feeling better than I had in a long time. Even if he didn\u0027t know everything about me, maybe there was truth in what George was saying - that what I chose to do was far more important than who I was or who I had been. As long as I continued to live like a productive member of society, then my Power would continue to ebb, until it was a nearly inaudible thrum in the background of my being. Meanwhile, I\u0027d have so many other things to concern myself with: livestock, property, industry, money. A smal smile played on my lips. The train lurched forward, and tea splashed al over the front of George\u0027s jacket. \"Oh blast!\" he murmured. \"Would you mind holding this?\" he asked, passing me his pages of the newspaper as he pul ed his handkerchief out of his pocket to dab at the stain. The bold font and exclamation points printed on the page immediately caught my eye. Murder! screamed the headline. Underneath the text was a line drawing of a woman, her bodice ripped, blood seeping from her throat, her eyes half-open. Even though it was just a drawing, the image was gruesome. I leaned in for a closer look, as if compel ed. \"Isn\u0027t that terrible?\" George asked, his gaze fal ing on the paper. \"Makes me glad to live far away from London.\" I nodded, barely listening. I took the paper, the grimy newsprint smearing on my hands as I hastily scanned the article. Woman of the night meets creature of darkness. The body of Mary Ann Nichols was found on the cobblestones of the Whitechapel area of London. Her throat was torn out and her innards removed. Could be connected to other deaths in the area. More details, from those who knew the victim. Page 23. Not even caring about the curious way George was eyeing me, I turned to the page, the newspaper shaking in my hands. Yes, the murder was gruesome, but it was achingly familiar. I stared back at the line drawing on the front page of Mary Ann. Her blank face was tilted toward the sky, unimaginable horror evident in her unblinking eyes. That wasn\u0027t the work of a jilted lover or a desperate thief. It was the work of a vampire. Not only that, it was the work of a brutal, bloodthirsty vampire. In al my years, I hadn\u0027t seen or heard of any murder so gruesome - except for twenty years ago, when Lucius had massacred the Sutherland family. Damon had been there, too. A shiver of fear ran up my spine. Wherever there were people, there were vampires. But most kept to themselves, and most, if they drank human blood, did so as quietly as possible: in shantytowns, from drunks on the street, simply compel ing their friends and neighbors so they could regularly feed without anyone sensing a thing. But then, there were the Originals. Rumored to be descended directly from hel , the Originals had never had a soul, and thus had no memories of what it was like to live, to hope, to cry, to be human. What they did have was a relentless thirst for blood and a desire for destruction. And if Klaus were here now . . . I shuddered to think of it, but just as quickly brushed the idea off. It was my overactive imagination at work. I was always assuming the worst, always assuming my secret was seconds away from being revealed. Always assuming I was doomed. No. More likely, this had been the work of a blood-drunk Damon who needed to be taught a lesson he should have learned a long time ago. After al , Damon wasn\u0027t only bloodthirsty; he was fame hungry. He loved the society pages. Would it be that far of a leap for him to want to suddenly appear in the crime pages, too? \"Don\u0027t let that story scare you off from London,\" George said, laughing a bit too loudly. \"This al took place in the slums. We won\u0027t be anywhere near there.\" \"It won\u0027t,\" I said firmly, my jaw set. I set the paper next to me. \"In fact, I think I wil take your offer and take the entire week off.\" \"As you wish,\" George said, leaning back into his chair, the murder story already off his mind. I glanced back down at the picture. The line il ustration was gory and gruesome, the il ustrator having clearly gone out of his way to vividly draw the innards fal ing out of the girl\u0027s body. Her face had been cut, too, but I kept glancing at her neck, wondering if two smal , shodding nail - size holes were hidden underneath the gore. The train whistled and I could see the vast expanse of London out the window. We were entering the city. I wanted the train to turn around and take me back to Abbott Manor. I wanted to run away, back to San Francisco or Australia, or somewhere where innocent people didn\u0027t get their throats ripped out by demons. Around us, porters bustled to get trunks and suitcases from the overhead bins. Across from me, George placed his hat on his head, glancing down to the paper. \"Can you imagine, that poor girl . . .\" George trailed off. The trouble was, I could imagine it al too wel . I could imagine Damon, flirting, al owing his hand to graze the woman\u0027s bodice. I pictured Damon, leaning in for a kiss as Mary Ann closed her eyes, ready for the brush of his lips. And then, I imagined the attack, a scream, her desperately clawing toward safety. And final y, I saw Damon, blood-drunk and sated, grinning in the moonlight. \"Stefan?\" \"Yes?\" I said gruffly, already on edge. George eyed me curiously. The porter was holding open the door to our cabin. \"I\u0027m ready,\" I said, steadying myself on the armrests as I stood up. \"You\u0027re shaking!\" George said, laughing loudly. \"But I promise you, London\u0027s in no way as frightening as the Ivinghoe woods. In fact, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you end up loving it. Bright lights, plenty of parties . . . why, if I were a younger man without responsibilities, I wouldn\u0027t be able to tear myself away from the place.\" \"Right,\" I said. His words had given me an idea. Until I\u0027d found out who - or what - was loose in the city, London was where I was going to stay. No matter what came, be it murderer, demon, or Damon, I was ready.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-3.html","bookId":2112,"book":{"id":2112,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: The Ripper (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #4) The year is 1888, and the scent of blood lingers heavy in the London air.
