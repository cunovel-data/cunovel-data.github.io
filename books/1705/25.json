{"id":66218,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"When pressed to explain the well-documented incidents of assault by psychomotor epileptics, these neurologists argue that such assaultative behavior, even when repetitive, sudden, and inappropriate, is not actual seizure activity. Some refer to it as \"epileptiform\" behavior. Others say that epilepsy per se is not the issue; they argue that any kind of brain damage - whether it produces epilepsy or not - may lead to episodic loss of inhibitions governing violent behavior. Whether or not one finds these explanations satisfactory, it seems unarguable that most neurologists who treat psychomotor epileptics as patients have found their patients to be very different from Harry Benson in THE TERMINAL MAN. The overwhelming majority of psychomotor epileptics are not violent or sexually disturbed; their seizures are under good control, and they lead rich and rewarding lives, holding good jobs and raising families. In the face of considerable controversy among clinical neuroscientists, I am persuaded that the understanding of the relationship between organic brain damage and violent behavior is not so clear as I thought at the time I wrote the book. I believe that this is a research area that will prove enormously fruitful in the coming years. But in the meantime, I am concerned that I may have inadvertently hampered the attempts of well-controlled epileptics to function in a society that still retains a lingering prejudice against epilepsy.

So violent that he often blackouts when they take hold. Shortly after severely beating two men during an episode, the police escort Benson to a Los Angeles hospital for treatment. There, Dr. Roger McPherson, head of the prestigious Neuropsychiatric Research Unit, is convinced he can cure Benson with an experimental procedure that would place electrodes deep in his brainâ€™s pleasure centers, effectively short-circuiting Harry\u0027s seizures with pulses of bliss. The surgery is successful, but while Benson is in recovery, he discovers how to trigger the pulses himself. To make matters worse his violent impulses have only grown, and he soon escapes the hospital with a deadly agenda. . .","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-terminal-man.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:05 AM"}}
