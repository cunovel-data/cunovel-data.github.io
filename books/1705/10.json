{"id":66203,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"Any smells? Strange sensations?\" As he asked, McPherson looked at the EEG scanner above the bed. It was still reading normal alpha patterns, without any suggestion of seizure activity.\\n\\n \"No. Nothing like that.\"\\n\\n \"But you feel as if you might explode?\" He thought: Ross should really be asking these questions.\\n\\n \"Sort of,\" Benson said. \"In the coming war, we may all explode.\"\\n\\n \"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"You look annoyed,\" Benson said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not, just puzzled. How do you mean, in the coming war?\"\\n\\n \"In the coming war between men and machines. The human brain is obsolete, you see.\"\\n\\n That was a new thought. McPherson hadn\u0027t heard it from\\n\\n Benson before. He stared at him, lying in the bed, his head and shoulders heavily bandaged. It made the upper part of his body and his head appear thick, gross, oversized.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Benson said. \"The human brain has gone as far as it is going to go. It\u0027s exhausted, so it spawned the next generation of intelligent forms. They will- Why am I so tired?\" He closed his eyes again.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re exhausted from the operation.\"\\n\\n \"A minor procedure,\" he said, and smiled with his eyes closed. A moment later he was snoring.\\n\\n McPherson remained by the bed for a moment, then turned to the window and watched the sun set over the Pacific. Benson had a nice room; you could see a bit of the ocean between the high-rise apartments in Santa Monica. He remained there for several minutes. Benson did not wake. Finally, McPherson went out to the nurses\u0027 station to write his note in the chart.\\n\\n \"Patient alert, responsive, oriented times three.\" He paused after writing that. He didn\u0027t really know if Benson was oriented to person, place, and time; he hadn\u0027t checked specifically. But he was clear and responsive, and McPherson let it go. \"Flow of ideas orderly and clear, but patient retains machine imagery of pre-operative state. It is too early to be certain, but it appears that early predictions were correct that the operation would not alter his mentation between seizures.\"\\n\\n Signed, \"Roger A. McPherson, M.D.\"\\n\\n He stared at it for a moment, then closed the chart and replaced it on the shelf. It was a good note, cool, direct, holding out no false anticipations. The chart was a legal document, after all, and it could be called into court. McPherson didn\u0027t expect to see Benson\u0027s chart in court, but you couldn\u0027t be too careful. He believed very strongly in appearances - and he felt it was his job to do so.\\n\\n The head of any large scientific laboratory performed a political function. You might deny it; you might dislike it. But it was nonetheless true, a necessary part of the job.\\n\\n You had to keep all the people in the lab happy as they worked together. The more prima donnas you had, the tougher the job was, as pure politics.\\n\\n You had to get your lab funded from outside sources, and that was also pure politics. Particularly if you were working in a delicate area, as the NPS was. McPherson had long since evolved the horseradish-peroxidase principle of grant applications. It was simple enough: when you applied for money, you announced that the money would be spent to find the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, which could lead to a cure for cancer. You would easily get sixty thousand dollars for that project - although you couldn\u0027t get sixty cents for mind control.\\n\\n He looked at the row of charts on the shelf, a row of unfamiliar names, into which BENSON, H. F. 710 merged indistinguishably. In one sense, he thought, Benson was correct - he was a walking time bomb. A man treated with mind-control technology was subject to all sorts of irrational public prejudice. \"Heart control\" in the form of cardiac pacemakers was considered a wonderful invention; \"kidney control\" through drugs was a blessing. But \"mind control\" was evil, a disaster- even though the NPS control work was directly analogous to control work with other organs. Even the technology was similar: the atomic pacemaker they were using had been developed first for heart work.\\n\\n But the prejudice remained. And Benson thought of himself as a ticking time bomb. McPherson sighed, took out the chart again, and flipped to the section containing doctors\u0027 orders. Both Ellis and Morris had written post-op care orders. McPherson added: \"After interfacing tomorrow a.m., begin thorazine.\"\\n\\n He looked at the note, then decided the nurses wouldn\u0027t understand interfacing. He scratched it out and wrote: \"After noon tomorrow, begin thorazine.\"\\n\\n As he left the floor, he thought that he would rest more easily once Benson was on thorazine. Perhaps they couldn\u0027t defuse the time bomb - but they could certainly drop it into a bucket of cold water.\\n\\n 7\\n\\n Late at night, in Telecomp, Gerhard stared anxiously at the computer console. He typed in more instructions, then walked to a print-out typewriter and began reviewing the long sheaf of green-striped sheets. He scanned them quickly, looking for the error he knew was there in the programmed instructions.\\n\\n The computer itself never made a mistake. Gerhard had used computers for nearly ten years - different computers, different places - and he had never seen one make a mistake. Of course, mistakes occurred all the time, but they were always in the program, not in the machine. Sometimes that infallibility was hard to accept. For one thing, it didn\u0027t fit with one\u0027s view of the rest of the world, where machines were always making mistakes - fuses blowing, stereos breaking down, ovens overheating, cars refusing to start. Modern man expected machines to make their fair share of errors.\\n\\n But computers were different, and working with them could be a humiliating experience. They were never wrong. It was as simple as that. Even when it took weeks to find the source of some problem, even when the program was checked a dozen times by as many different people, even when the whole staff was slowly coming to the conclusion that for once, the computer circuitry had fouled up - it always turned out, in the end, to be a human error of some kind. Always.\\n\\n Richards came in, shrugging off a sport coat, and poured himself a cup of coffee. \"How\u0027s it going?\"\\n\\n Gerhard shook his head. \"I\u0027m having trouble with George.\"\\n\\n \"Again? Shit.\" Richards looked at the console. \"How\u0027s\\n\\n Martha?\"\\n\\n \"Martha\u0027s fine, I think. It\u0027s just George.\"\\n\\n \"Which George is it?\"\\n\\n \"Saint George,\" Gerhard said. \"Really a bitch.\"\\n\\n Richards sipped his coffee and sat down at the console.\\n\\n \"Mind if I try it?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Gerhard said.\\n\\n Richards began flicking buttons. He called up the program for Saint George. Then he called up the program for Martha. Then he pushed the interaction button.\\n\\n Richards and Gerhard hadn\u0027t devised these programs; they were modified from several existing computer programs developed at other universities. But the basic idea was the same - to create a computer program that would make the computer act emotionally, like people. It was logical to designate the programs with names like George and Martha. There was a precedent for that: Eliza in Boston, and Aldous in England.\\n\\n George and Martha were essentially the same program with slight differences. The original George was programmed to be neutral in his response to stimuli. Then Martha was created. Martha was a little bitchy; Martha disliked most things. Finally, another George was formulated, a very loving George, who was referred to as Saint George.\\n\\n Each program could respond with three emotional states - love, fear, and anger. Each could produce three actions - approach, withdrawal, and attack. All this was, of course, highly abstract. It was carried out in terms of numbers. For example, the original George was neutral to most numbers, but he disliked the number 751. He was programmed to dislike it. And by extension he disliked similar numbers - 743, 772, and so on. He much preferred numbers such as 404, 133, and 918. If you punched in one of these numbers, George responded with numbers signifying love and approach. If you punched in 707, George withdrew. If you punched in 750, George angrily attacked - according to the numbers he printed out.\\n\\n The NPS staff had played with the programs in this way for a long time. Then they had incorporated program modifications to allow for \"talk\" from the computer. The numbers were translated into sentences. This was amusing, and revealing. The actual interaction was referred to as \"the Christmas game\" because most of it was conducted as giving and receiving gifts - objects that had an assigned or learned emotional value, just as the numbers did.\\n\\n Normal George interacting with Martha would eventually win her over, and her bitchiness would recede into the background.\\n\\n But Saint George had a much worse effect on her. His loving acceptance drove her up the wall. That is, if things were working normally. Richards watched as the print-out flashed across the screen.\\n\\n HELLO I\u0027M SAINT GEORGE\\n\\n HELLO\\n\\n WHAT IS YOUR NAME?\\n\\n MARTHA.\\n\\n YOU DON\u0027T SAY MUCH, MARTHA.\\n\\n NO\\n\\n BUT I LIKE YOU.\\n\\n WHY I DON\u0027T LIKE YOU.\\n\\n I UNDERSTAND THAT. HOW CAN I HELP?\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t printing periods consistently,\" Richards said.\\n\\n \"When did that start?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nothing,\" Gerhard said. \"Just keep watching.\"\\n\\n HELP?\\n\\n YES, I WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU.\\n\\n HAVE A CAT.\\n\\n Richards winced. Cats were programmed to be something that both George and Martha disliked. Giving George a cat was a very hostile move.\\n\\n THANK YOU\\n\\n HAVE ANOTHER CAT.\\n\\n THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND.\\n\\n HAVE ANOTHER CAT.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n DON\u0027T YOU LIKE CATS?\\n\\n YES BUT I HAVE ENOUGH CATS.\\n\\n HAVE A GORILLA.\\n\\n \"Really nasty,\" Richards said. \"What are the other interactions like?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Pretty much the same,\" Gerhard said.\\n\\n \"As bad as this?\"\\n\\n \"Pretty much.\"\\n\\n They were accustomed now to the idea that when the computers interacted, the results were unpredictable. The general form of interaction could be guessed, but the specific results were uncertain. It was like a computer playing checkers - it was probably going to win, but it would win a different way each time, depending on what the opponent did.\\n\\n I DON\u0027T WANT A GORILLA. DON\u0027T YOU LIKE GORILLAS? NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n YOU ARE TOO POLITE.\\n\\n I AM SORRY IF I OFFEND YOU IN ANY WAY.\\n\\n YOU TALK TOO MUCH.\\n\\n I AM SORRY.\\n\\n HAVE AN EGGPLANT.\\n\\n Richards watched with interest. Saint George had no background for eggplants. But he disliked cucumbers and bananas.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n DON\u0027T YOU LIKE EGGPLANT?\\n\\n NOT VERY MUCH.\\n\\n HERE HAVE ANOTHER ONE.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n I WANT YOU TO HAE IT.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n GO ON AND TAKE IT.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n I INSIST.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happened to Saint George?\" Richards asked. \"His responses are too much the same.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what\u0027s bothering me.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he cycling through on the program?\"\\n\\n \"I was looking for it when you came in.\"\\n\\n I INSIST THAT YOU HAVE A CUCUMBER.\\n\\n I REFUSE.\\n\\n \"George!\" Richards said, almost without thinking.\\n\\n THEN HAVE A BANANA.\\n\\n NO.\\n\\n \"George is breaking down,\" Richards said. \"He\u0027s not a saint any more.\"\\n\\n THEN HAVE BOTH A BANANA AND A CUCUMBER.\\n\\n NO THANK YOU.\\n\\n I INSIST.\\n\\n GO TO HELL I WILL KILL YOU:::::::::\\n\\n The screen was filled with white dots. \"What does that mean, unprintable response?\" Richards said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never seen it before tonight.\"\\n\\n \"How many times has this program been run?\" Richards asked.\\n\\n \"One hundred and ten, against Martha.\"\\n\\n \"Any learning erasures?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be goddamned,\" Richards said. \"He\u0027s getting to be a short-tempered saint.\" He grinned. \"We can write this one up.\"\\n\\n Gerhard nodded and went back to the print-out. In theory, what was happening was not puzzling. Both George and Martha were programmed to learn from experience. Like the checkers-playing programs - where the machine got better each time it played a game - this program was established so that the machine would \"learn\" new responses to things. After one hundred and ten sets of experience, Saint George had abruptly stopped being a saint. He was learning not to be a saint around Martha - even though he had been programmed for saintliness.\\n\\n \"I know just how he feels,\" Richards said, and switched the machine off. Then he joined Gerhard, looking for the programming error that had made it all possible.\\n\\n Thursday, March 11, 1971: Interfacing\\n\\n 1\\n\\n Janet Ross sat in the empty room and glanced at the wall clock. It was 9 a.m. She looked down at the desk in front of her, which was bare except for a vase of flowers and a notepad. She looked at the chair opposite her. Then, aloud, she said, \"How\u0027re we doing?\"\\n\\n There was a mechanical click and Gerhard\u0027s voice came through the speaker mounted in the ceiling. \"We need a few minutes for the sound levels. The light is okay. You want to talk a minute?\"\\n\\n She nodded, and glanced over her shoulder at the one-way mirror behind her. She saw only her reflection, but she knew Gerhard, with his equipment, was behind, watching her. \"You sound tired,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Trouble with Saint George last night,\" Gerhard said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m tired, too,\" she said. \"I was having trouble with somebody who isn\u0027t a saint.\" She laughed. She was just talking so they could get a sound level for the room; she hadn\u0027t really paid attention to what she was saying. But it was true: Arthur was no saint. He was also no great discovery, though she\u0027d thought he might be a few weeks ago when she first met him. She had been, in fact, a little infatuated with him. (\"Infatuated? Hmm? Is that what you\u0027d call it?\" She could hear Dr. Ramos now.) Arthur had been born handsome and wealthy. He had a yellow Ferrari, a lot of dash, and a lot of charm. She was able to feel feminine and frivolous around him. He did madcap, dashing things like flying her to Mexico City for dinner because he knew a little restaurant where they made the best tacos in the world. She knew it was all silly, but she enjoyed it. And in a way she was relieved - she never had to talk about medicine, or the hospital, or psychiatry. Arthur wasn\u0027t interested in any of those things; he was interested in her as a woman. (\"Not as a sex object?\" Damn Dr. Ramos.) \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man/page-10.html","bookId":1705,"book":{"id":1705,"title":"The Terminal Man","description":"Storyline: Harry Benson suffers from violent seizures.
