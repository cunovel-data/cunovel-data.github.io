{"id":66217,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Inside the room there were six magnetic tape units, a broad L-shaped console for the central processor, a printer, a card-punch reader, and two disc drive units. The equipment was shiny, sharp-edged, gleaming. It sat quiet under even, fluorescent lighting. She saw no one - just the equipment, isolated, alone. It reminded her of Stonehenge, the vertical stone columns.\\n\\n Then she saw him: a man moving between two tape units. White orderly\u0027s coat, black hair.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s him,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the door?\" Anders asked. For no good reason, he was checking his gun again. He snapped the revolver chamber closed with a loud click.\\n\\n \"Down there.\" She pointed down the corridor to the door, perhaps ten feet away.\\n\\n \"Any other entrances or exits?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Chapter 18\\n\\n Her heart was still pounding. She looked from Anders to the gun and back to Anders.\\n\\n \"Okay. You stay down.\" Anders pressed her down to the floor as he spoke. Then he crawled forward to the door. He paused, got to his knees, and looked back at her once. She was surprised to see that he was frightened. His face was taut, his body hunched tensely. He held the gun stiffly forward by his straight arm.\\n\\n We\u0027re all afraid, she thought.\\n\\n Then, with a loud slam, Anders knocked the door open and flung himself on his belly into the room. She heard him shout, \"Benson!\" And then almost immediately there was a gunshot. This was followed by a second shot, and a third. She could not tell who was firing. She saw Anders\u0027s feet sticking out of the door as he lay on the carpeting. Gray smoke billowed out through the open door and rose lazily in the corridor.\\n\\n There were two more shots and a loud scream of pain. She closed her eyes and pressed her cheek to the carpet. Anders shouted: \"Benson! Give it up, Benson!\"\\n\\n It won\u0027t do any good, she thought. Didn\u0027t Anders understand?\\n\\n Still more shots, in rapid succession. Suddenly, the glass window above her shattered, and large slabs of glass fell over her shoulders, onto her hair. She shook it off. And then to her astonishment Benson landed on the corridor floor beside her. He had thrown himself through the glass window and landed quite close to her. His body was just a few feet from her. She saw that one leg was bloody, red seeping onto the white trouser leg.\\n\\n \"Harry- \"\\n\\n Her voice cracked strangely. She was terrified. She knew she should not be afraid of this man - that was a disservice to him, a betrayal of her profession, and a loss of some important trust - but she was afraid nonetheless.\\n\\n Benson looked at her, eyes blank and unseeing. He ran off down the basement corridor.\\n\\n \"Harry, wait- \"\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" Anders said, coming out of the computer room, sprinting after Benson, holding his gun stiffly in his hand. The policeman\u0027s posture was absurd; she wanted to laugh. She heard Benson\u0027s running footsteps echoing faintly down the tunnel. Then Anders turned a corner, continuing after him. The footsteps blended in staccato echoes.\\n\\n And then she was alone. She got to her feet, dazed, feeling sick. She knew what was going to happen now, Benson, like a trapped animal, would head for one of the emergency exits. As soon as he appeared outside - where it was safe to shoot - the waiting policemen would gun him down. All the exits were covered. There was no possible escape. She didn\u0027t want to be there to see it.\\n\\n Instead, she went into the computer room and looked around. The main computer was demolished. Two magnetic tape banks were knocked over; the main control panel was riddled with fine round punctures, and sparks sputtered and dripped from the panel toward the floor. She ought to control that, she thought. It might start a fire. She looked around for a fire extinguisher and saw Benson\u0027s axe lying on the carpet in a corner. And then she saw the gun.\\n\\n Curious, she picked it up. It was surprisingly heavy, much heavier than she expected. It felt big and greasy and cold in her hand. She knew Anders had his gun; therefore this must be Benson\u0027s. Benson\u0027s gun. She stared at it oddly, as if it might tell her something about him.\\n\\n From somewhere in the basement, there were four gunshots in rapid succession. They echoed through the labyrinthine hospital tunnels. She walked to the broken windows and looked out at the tunnels. She saw nothing, heard nothing.\\n\\n It must be finished, she thought. The sputtering, hissing sound of sparks behind her made her turn. There was also a slapping sound, repetitive and monotonous. She saw that one of the magnetic tape reels had spun out, and the edge of the tape was slapping against the hardware spindle.\\n\\n She went back to the reel and turned it off. She glanced up at one of the display consoles, which was now printing\\n\\n \"ERMINA\" over and over. \"ERMINA, ERMINA.\" Then there were two more gunshots, not so distant as the others, and she realized that somehow Benson was still alive, still going. She stood in a corner of the demolished computer room and waited.\\n\\n Another gunshot, very close now.\\n\\n She ducked down behind one of the magnetic tape banks as she heard approaching footsteps. She was aware of the irony: Benson had been hiding behind the computers, and now she was hiding, cowering behind the metal columns, as if they could protect her in some way.\\n\\n She heard someone gasping for breath; the footsteps paused; the door to the computer room opened, then closed with a slam. She was still hidden behind the tape bank, and could not see what was happening.\\n\\n A second set of running feet went past the computer room and continued down the corridor, fading into echoes. Everything was quiet. Then she heard heavy breathing and a cough.\\n\\n She stood.\\n\\n Harry Benson, in his torn white orderly\u0027s clothes, his left leg very red, was sprawled on the carpet, his body half-propped up against the wall. He was sweating; his breath came in ragged gasps; he stared straight ahead, unaware of anyone else in the room.\\n\\n She still held the gun in her hand, and she felt a moment of elation. Somehow it was all going to work out. She was going to get him back alive. The police hadn\u0027t killed him, and by the most unbelievable stroke of luck she had him alone, to herself. It made her wonderfully happy.\\n\\n \"Harry.\"\\n\\n He looked over slowly and blinked. He did not seem to recognize her for a moment, and then he smiled. \"Hello, Dr. Ross.\"\\n\\n It was a nice smile. She had the brief image of McPherson, with his white hair, bending over to congratulate her on saving the project and getting Benson back alive. And then she remembered, quite incongruously, how her own father had gotten sick and had suddenly had to leave her medical-school graduation ceremonies. Why did she think of that now?\\n\\n \"Everything is going to be all right, Harry,\" she said. Her voice was full of confidence; it pleased her.\\n\\n She wanted to reassure him, so she did not move, did not approach him. She stayed across the room, behind the computer data bank.\\n\\n He continued to breathe heavily, and said nothing for a moment. He looked around the room at the demolished computer equipment. \"I really did it,\" he said. \"Didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to be fine, Harry,\" she said. She was drawing up a schedule in her mind. He could undergo emergency surgery on his leg that night, and in the morning they could disconnect his computer, reprogram the electrodes, and everything would be corrected. A disaster would be salvaged. It was the most incredible piece of luck. Ellis would keep his house. McPherson would continue to expand the NPS into new areas. They would be grateful. They would recognize her achievement and appreciate what she-\\n\\n \"Dr. Ross...\" He started to get up, wincing in pain.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t try to move. Stay where you are, Harry.\"\\n\\n \"I have to.\"\\n\\n \"Stay where you are, Harry.\"\\n\\n Benson\u0027s eyes flashed briefly, and the smile was gone.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me Harry. My name is Mr. Benson. Call me Mr. Benson.\"\\n\\n There was no mistaking the anger in his voice. It surprised her and upset her. She was trying to help him.\\n\\n Didn\u0027t he know that she was the only one who still wanted to help him? The others would be just as happy if he died.\\n\\n He continued to struggle to his feet.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t move, Harry.\" She showed him the gun then. It was an angry, hostile move. He had angered her. She knew she shouldn\u0027t get angry at him, but she had.\\n\\n He grinned in childish recognition. \"That\u0027s my gun.\"\\n\\n \"I have it now,\" she said.\\n\\n He still grinned, a fixed expression, partly from pain. He got to his feet and leaned heavily against the wall. There was a dark red stain on the carpet where his leg had rested. He looked down and saw it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hurt,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t move. You\u0027ll be all right.\"\\n\\n \"He shot me in the leg...\" He looked from the blood up to her. His smile remained. \"You wouldn\u0027t use that, would you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"if I had to.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re my doctor.\"\\n\\n \"Stay where you are, Harry.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you would use it,\" Benson said. He took a step toward her.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t come closer, Harry.\"\\n\\n He smiled. He took another step, unsteady, but he maintained his balance. \"I don\u0027t think you would.\"\\n\\n His words frightened her. She was afraid that she would shoot him, and afraid that she would not. It was the strangest set of circumstances, alone with this man, surrounded by the wreckage of a computer.\\n\\n \"Anders!\" she shouted. \"Anders!\" Her voice echoed through the basement.\\n\\n Benson took another step. His eyes never left her face. He started to fall, and leaned heavily on one of the disc drive consoles. It tore his white jacket at the armpit. He looked at the tear numbly. \"It tore...\"\\n\\n \"Stay there, Harry. Stay there.\" It\u0027s like talking to an animal, she thought. Do not feed or molest the animals. She felt like a lion tamer in the circus.\\n\\n He hung there a moment, supporting himself on the drive console, breathing heavily. \"I want the gun,\" he said. \"I need it. Give it to me.\"\\n\\n \"Harry- \"\\n\\n With a grunt, he pushed away from the console and continued moving toward her.\\n\\n \"Anders!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no good,\" Benson said. \"There\u0027s no time left, Dr. Ross.\" His eyes were on her. She saw the pupils expand briefly as he received a stimulation. \"That\u0027s beautiful,\" he said, and smiled.\\n\\n The stimulation seemed to halt him for a time. He was turned inward, enjoying the sensation. When he spoke again, his voice was calm and distant. \"You see,\" he said, \"they are after me. They have turned their little computers against me. The program is hunt. Hunt and kill. The original human program. Hunt and kill. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n He was only a few steps away. She held the gun in her hand stiffly, as she had seen Anders hold it. But her hand was shaking badly. \"Please don\u0027t come closer, Harry,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Please.\"\\n\\n He smiled.\\n\\n He took another step.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t really know what she was going to do until she found herself squeezing the trigger, and the gun discharged. The noise was painfully loud, and the gun snapped in her hand, flinging her arm up, almost knocking her off her feet. She was thrown back against the far wall of the computer room.\\n\\n Benson stood blinking in the smoke. Then he smiled again.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not as easy as it looks.\"\\n\\n She gripped the gun in her hand. It felt warm now. She raised it, but it was shaking worse than before. She steadied it with the other hand.\\n\\n Benson advanced.\\n\\n \"No closer, Harry. I mean it.\"\\n\\n A flood of images overcame her. She saw Benson as she had first met him, a meek man with a terrifying problem. She saw him in a montage of all the hour-long interviews, all the tests, all the drug trials. He was a good person, an honest and frightened person. Nothing that had happened was his fault. It was her fault, and Ellis\u0027s fault, and McPherson\u0027s fault, and Morris\u0027s fault.\\n\\n Then she thought of Morris, the face mashed into a red pulp, deformed into butcher meat.\\n\\n \"Dr. Ross,\" Benson said. \"You\u0027re my doctor. You wouldn\u0027t do anything to hurt me.\"\\n\\n He was very close now. His hands reached out for the gun. Her whole body was shaking as she watched the hands move closer, within inches of the barrel, reaching for it, reaching for it...\\n\\n She fired at point-blank range.\\n\\n With remarkable agility, Benson jumped and spun in the air, dodging the bullet. She was pleased. She had managed to drive him back without hurting him. Anders would arrive any minute to help subdue him before they took him to surgery.\\n\\n Benson\u0027s body slammed hard into the printing unit, knocking it over. It began to clatter in a monotonous, mechanical way as the keys printed out some message. Benson rolled onto his back. Blood spurted in heavy thick gushes from his chest. His white uniform became darkly red.\\n\\n \"Harry?\" she said.\\n\\n He did not move.\\n\\n \"Harry? Harry?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t remember clearly what happened after that.\\n\\n Anders returned and took the gun from her hand. He moved her to the side of the room as three men in gray suits arrived, carrying a long plastic capsule on a stretcher. They opened the capsule up; the inside was lined in a strange, yellow honeycomb insulation. They lifted Benson\u0027s body - she noticed they were careful, trying to keep the blood off their special suits - and placed him inside the capsule. They closed it and locked it with special locks. Two of the men carried it away. A third went around the room with a Geiger counter, which chattered loudly. Somehow the sound reminded her of an angry monkey. The man went over to Ross. She couldn\u0027t see his face behind the gray helmet he wore; the glass was fogged.\\n\\n \"You better leave this area,\" the man said.\\n\\n Anders put his arm around her shoulders. She began to cry.\\n\\n Postscript\\n\\n A Note on Psychomotor Epilepsy\\n\\n Since the publication of this book in its hardcover edition, several neurologists have advised me that the syndrome of psychomotor epilepsy is incorrectly portrayed in significant ways. These professionals emphasize that psychomotor epileptics are no more prone to criminal behavior than other individuals in society. They also agree that a psychomotor epileptic in the midst of a seizure is unlikely to injure anyone, except by accident. They regard complex, purposeful aggressive behavior in the course of a seizure to be either extremely rare, or nonexistent. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man/page-24.html","bookId":1705,"book":{"id":1705,"title":"The Terminal Man","description":"Storyline: Harry Benson suffers from violent seizures.
