{"id":110749,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"I SPOKE IT THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST. I\u0027d been unable to when we\u0027d first gotten up. For a few minutes, of course, there was the inevitable rush of rejection toward what I\u0027d seen. What I\u0027d tried to do the night before, I tried again-to believe that it was only a febrile dream. One\u0027s mind can far more easily accept that sort of explanation. There\u0027s reason to it, something to grasp hold of; even when it isn\u0027t true. I\u0027d been unable to speak, too, because it seemed so completely inappropriate. It just didn\u0027t fit in with good mornings and kissing\u0027s and dressing and getting Sunday breakfast ready. But when Richard was finished eating and had gone out into the yard to play, and Anne and Phil and I were sitting at the kitchen table over coffee, I did say it. \"I saw a ghost last night.\" It\u0027s fantastic how the most terrifying of statements can sound absurd. Phil\u0027s reaction was to grin. Even Anne smiled a little. \"You what?\" she asked. Her smile was the first to fade. It went as soon as she saw how serious I was. \"Honey, what do you mean?\" she asked. \"You dreamed it?\" I swallowed. It\u0027s not what one could call the easiest thing in the world to talk about. \"I\u0027d like to think that,\" I said, \"but I... can\u0027t.\" I looked at them both. \"I really saw one. I mean I was awake and I saw one.\" \"This is on the level?\" Phil asked. I didn\u0027t say anything. I just nodded. \"When?\" Anne asked. I put down my cup. \"After I got up last night,\" I said. \"That is, this morning. It must have been about two.\" \"I didn\u0027t hear you get up,\" she said. \"You were asleep,\" I told her. Even as I spoke, a rush of crude hope filled me that it really had been a dream. \"This was-after you told me you couldn\u0027t sleep?\" she asked. I could tell she didn\u0027t believe me; rather, didn\u0027t believe that I\u0027d seen what I said I\u0027d seen. I said yes. I looked at both of them and shrugged with a helpless, palms-up gesture. \"That\u0027s it,\" I said. \"I saw a ghost. I saw it.\" \"What did it look like?\" Phil asked. He didn\u0027t even try to conceal his fascination. This was meat for him. I drew in a ragged breath, then shrugged again as if I felt slightly ashamed of what I was saying. As a matter of fact I think I was; a little. \"It was a woman,\" I said. \"She was-in her thirties, I\u0027d say. Had dark hair and-was about, oh, five-foot-six. She was wearing an odd dress-black with a strange design on it. And there was a string of pearls around her neck.\" There was a moment\u0027s suspension, then Anne said, \"You saw this?\" \"I saw it,\" I said. \"I was in the living room, sitting on the green chair. I looked up and-she was standing there.\" I swallowed. \"Looking at me.\" \"Honey...\" I couldn\u0027t tell what I heard more of in her voice-sympathy or revulsion. \"You really saw it then,\" said Phil, \"I mean with your eyes?\" \"Phil, I told you,\" I said, \"I saw it. It wasn\u0027t a dream. Let\u0027s toss that out right now. It happened. I got up, I went into the bathroom. I heard you sleeping. I checked Richard to see if he was all right, I looked out the back window at the yard. I sat down on the green chair-and I saw her. Like that. I was awake. It wasn\u0027t any dream.\" I noticed how Anne was looking at me. It was a complex look, compounded of many things-curiosity, withdrawal, concern, love, fear; all of them in the one look. \"Before this happened,\" Phil said, \"what was your mental state? I mean, why couldn\u0027t you sleep?\" I looked at him curiously. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Because I think you were in a state of mental turmoil. Before you-let\u0027s say-saw what you did.\" \"Phil, I did see it,\" I said, a little impatiently now. \"Come on. I just won\u0027t go along with this dream idea. Don\u0027t, for God\u0027s sake, humour me. I\u0027m not a mental case.\" \"Of course you\u0027re not,\" Phil said quickly. \"I didn\u0027t mean that for a second. What you saw was as real to you as I am, sitting here across from you.\" I didn\u0027t know exactly what he was driving at but I said, \"Okay, then. That\u0027s settled.\" \"You were in an aroused mental state, though,\" Phil said. It wasn\u0027t a question this time. I looked at him a moment, warily. I didn\u0027t want to be led to any pat conclusion about this. But of course I had to say yes to his statement. \"All right,\" he said, \"and I imagine you even have a headache now. Do you?\" \"A little one.\" I felt myself start. \"How do you know all this?\" I asked. \"Because it follows a pattern, brother man,\" he said. \"You had a hallucination as a result of-\" \"Phil...\" I started. \"Listen to me.\" \"Phil, it wasn\u0027t a hallucination! You were right before, not now. What I saw was as real to me as you are, sitting there.\" \"Of course it was. Do you think that makes it actual?\" That stopped me cold. It\u0027s the sort of question that can topple anything; make even the most objective reality spin away into tenuous nothingness. I sat there staring at him blankly, feeling that light pulse of pain in my head. \"What do you mean?\" I finally asked. \"Simply this,\" he said, \"people have had hallucinations before-in broad daylight, much less dead of night. They\u0027ve shaken hands with their hallucinations, talked with them.\" \"What you\u0027re trying to say,\" I said, unable to keep from smiling a little, \"is that your old brother-in-law is ready for the hatch.\" \"Oh, hell, no,\" Phil said. \"That woman exists. I don\u0027t know where-or when. But she\u0027s real. I mean she lives somewhere-or did live somewhere. She\u0027s someone you\u0027ve known or seen-or maybe haven\u0027t seen; that isn\u0027t necessary. The point is, what you saw wasn\u0027t a ghost. Not in the usual sense of the word anyway-though plenty of so-called ghosts would fit into this category.\" \"Which is?\" I asked. \"Telepathic images,\" Phil said. \"If one person can see a card with a symbol on it, another person can see what looks like a human being. I mean see it. Your mind was keyed up high because of our little experiment last night. You saw this woman. Naturally, the first thing you thought of was ghost. That\u0027s the trouble with our attitude-not just yours, Tom. \"People won\u0027t believe in reasonable, verifiable phenomena-things like hypnotism, telepathy, clairvoyance. No, that they won\u0027t accept. But they see something and, in a second-whammo!-they\u0027re off the edge, flying high. Because they\u0027re not prepared, because they can only react with instinctive emotion. They won\u0027t accept reasonable things with their minds but the fantastic things they\u0027ll swallow whole when their emotions are brought into play. Because the emotions have no limits on belief. The emotions will swallow anything-and they do. As witness yourself. You\u0027re an intelligent man, Tom. But the only thing you thought of was ghost.\" He paused and Anne and I stared at him. He\u0027d sounded just like Alan Porter. \"The end,\" he said, grinning. \"Pass the basket.\" \"So you don\u0027t think I saw it then,\" I said. \"You did see it,\" he answered, \"but in your mind\u0027s eye. And, believe me, brother man, seeing it that way can be just as realistic to you as seeing it the ordinary way. Sometimes a lot more realistic.\" He grinned. \"Hell, man,\" he said, \"you were a medium last night.\" We talked about it some more. I didn\u0027t have much to offer, though-except objections. It\u0027s a little hard to let go of a thing like that. Maybe the human reaction is to cling to it a little. As Phil had indicated, it\u0027s a lot more \"romantic\" to see a ghost. Not so really thrilling to write it off as \"mere\" telepathy. It was Anne who broke it up. \"Well, we\u0027re doing a lot of talking about this,\" she said with her true woman\u0027s mind, \"but we\u0027re missing the whole point. What I want to know is-who was this woman?\" Phil and I both had to laugh at the combination of curiosity and wifely suspicion in her voice. \"Who else?\" Phil said. \"One of his girl friends.\" I shook my head. \"I wish I knew,\" I said, \"but I can\u0027t remember ever seeing her.\" I shrugged. \"Maybe it was-what\u0027s her name?-Helen Driscoll.\" \"Whoozat, whoozat?\" Phil asked. \"She\u0027s the woman who used to live in this house,\" Anne told him. \"She\u0027s Mrs. Sentas\u0027 sister; the woman who lives next door.\" \"Oh.\" Phil shrugged. \"Could be.\" \"So I saw the ghost of Helen Driscoll,\" I said, straight-faced. \"Except for one little thing,\" Anne said. \"What?\" Phil asked. \"She\u0027s not dead. She just went back east.\" \"Not west,\" said Phil. The headache got worse. So much worse that I had to beg off going to the beach that afternoon. I made them go without me; told Anne not to worry, I\u0027d take an aspirin and lie down until the headache went away. They went a few minutes past two, piling into Phil\u0027s coupe with basket, blanket, beach bag, lotions, et al. I stood on the porch waving to Richard as the Mercury gunned up Tulley Street. Like so many young men Phil liked to be doing about fifty before he shifted into third. I watched until the car turned left onto the boulevard; then I went back inside the house. As I started to close the door I saw Elizabeth out on her lawn again, white gloved, poking a trowel at the garden soil. She had on a wide-brimmed straw hat that she and Frank had bought in Tijuana. She didn\u0027t look over at me. I stood there a moment watching her slow, tired movements. The term \"professional martyr\" occurred to me and I put it off as unworthy. I shut the sight of her away with the door. Anyway, I had my own troubles. For a moment I wondered where Frank was, deciding that he was either sleeping in his house or else stretched out on the beach, ogling girls. I shook that off too. It simply wasn\u0027t my business. I turned and stood looking at the spot where the woman had been. A shudder plaited down my back. I tried to visualize her but it was hard in the daylight. I went over to the exact spot and stood on it, feeling the warmth of the sunlight on my ankles. It was almost impossible to believe that it hadn\u0027t been a dream. I went into the kitchen and put on some water for coffee. I leaned against the edge of the sink counter while I waited for it to boil. It was very quiet in the house. I stared down at the multicoloured spatter design on the linoleum until it swam before my eyes. In the cupboard I could hear the alarm clock ticking. It reminded me of Poe\u0027s story about the telltale heart. It sounded like a heart beating hollowly behind the shielding of the cabinet door. I closed my eyes and sighed. Why couldn\u0027t I believe Phil? Everything he\u0027d said had been so sensible-on the surface. There was my answer, I decided. What I felt wasn\u0027t on the surface. It was a subterranean trickle of awareness far beneath the level of consciousness. All right, it was emotion. Perhaps emotion was a better gauge for things like that. \"I said come in here!\" I started with a gasp, my head jerking up so fast it sent electric twinges along my neck muscles. For a moment, I actually expected to see the woman in the strange black dress standing before me again. \"Ron!\" I heard then. \"I mean now!\" I swallowed and blew out a long, trembling breath. \"All right,\" I heard. \"All right. What about that?\" I couldn\u0027t hear Ron\u0027s answer. You never could. Elsie might have been conducting a vituperative monologue across the alley. \"I told you at breakfast, damn it, I don\u0027t want your damn clothes laying all over my house!\" Amusement broke into sound in my throat and I shook my head slowly. Dear God, I thought; her house. She didn\u0027t want his clothes lying all over her house. Ron was a boarder there, not the legal owner. A man\u0027s home is his castle, I thought, unless his wife makes him live in the dungeon. I wondered for a diverting moment what kind of match Ron and Elizabeth would make. One thing for sure, I decided, it would be the quietest damn house on the block. \"And what about the oven?\" Elsie asked. \"You said you were going to clean it this weekend. Well, have you?\" It made me cringe to hear talk like that. I felt my hands curling up into instinctive fists. \"One of these days,\" I muttered, half myself, half imagining myself as Ron, \"one of these days. Pow! Right to the moon!\" My punch at the air sent jagged lines of pain through my head. Laughter faded with a wince. I couldn\u0027t stay amused anyway. There was my own problem. It wasn\u0027t over. No matter what Phil said, it wasn\u0027t over. I was drinking my coffee when I heard bare feet padding in the alley. I looked up and saw Elsie come up onto the back porch. Through the film of the door curtains, I saw that she was wearing a black bathing suit. She knocked. \"Anne?\" she called. I got up and opened the door. \"Oh, hi\" she said, quickly rearranging her smile from one of polite neighbourliness to one of mathematical seduction. At least that was the effect I got. \"Good afternoon,\" I said. The bathing suit clung to her plumpness as if she\u0027d been dipped into it rather than pulled it on. \"Tom, could I borrow those raffia-covered glasses?\" she asked. \"I\u0027m having some relatives over tonight.\" \"Yeah. Sure.\" I backed away a step, then turned for the cupboard. I heard her come in the kitchen and shut the door. \"Where\u0027s Anne?\" she asked. The sound of the question was innocent. Yet, for some reason, I knew it wasn\u0027t. \"Gone to the beach,\" I told her. \"You mean you\u0027re all alone?\" she said. \"Yum yum.\" It was supposed to be a joke but, like Frank, Elsie was incapable of obscuring her motive with words. \"That\u0027s right,\" I said, pulling open the cabinet door. Suddenly I felt that tingling in my temples again. It made my hand twitch. I looked back over my shoulder, half expecting to see that woman. There was only Elsie. \"You should have told me,\" she minced. \"I\u0027d have put on something more-appropriate.\" I swallowed and took down the glasses. I had the very definite inclination to tell her to get out of the house. I didn\u0027t know why. There was just something about her that disturbed me. And it wasn\u0027t the obvious thing either. \"How long are they going to be gone?\" Elsie asked. I turned with the glasses. \"Why do you ask?\" I made the mistake of smiling as I said it. To Elsie it probably looked as if I slipped at that moment. I didn\u0027t. I reeled as a wave of raw sensation hit me. I caught for balance at the sink and managed to catch myself without breaking a glass. \"No reason,\" she said, obviously taking my slip for a form of fluster. \"Why? Should I have?\" I stood there looking at her. She wasn\u0027t smiling. She stood there without moving, one hand on the out-jutting curve of a hip. I noticed the line of dewy sweat across her upper lip and how the sunlight behind her was shining through the golden aura of hair along the edges of her shoulders, arms and neck. \"Guess not.\" I walked over and handed her the glasses. I don\u0027t know whether it was an accident that our hands touched. I jerked mine away a little too quickly to hide it. \"What\u0027s the matter, Tom?\" she asked with the tone of voice used by a woman who is convinced she\u0027s irresistible. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"You\u0027re blushing!\" I knew I wasn\u0027t; and realized that it was a trick she used to fluster the men she flirted with. \"Am I?\" I said coldly. That desire was thrusting itself through me; the desire to push her violently from the house. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not embarrassing you in this suit, am I?\" \"Not at all,\" I said. I felt physically ill standing so close to her. She seemed to radiate something that wrenched my insides. I turned to the door and opened it. \"I have a little headache, that\u0027s all,\" I explained. \"I was just about to lie down.\" \"Oh-h.\" The sympathy was false too; I felt it. \"You lie down then. Lying down can help a lot-of things.\" She finished as if it were an afterthought. \"Yes. I will.\" \"I\u0027ll bring the glasses back tonight,\" she said. \"No hurry,\" I answered. I wanted to scream into her face- Will you get the hell out of here! Repressing it made me shiver. \"That was quite a party we had last night,\" said Elsie. Her voice seemed to come from a distance. I couldn\u0027t see her face distinctly. \"Yes,\" I managed to say, \"very interesting.\" \"You really knew what you were doing, though, didn\u0027t you?\" she told me. I nodded quickly, willing to say anything to get her out. \"Yes. Of course.\" \"I knew it,\" she said, satisfied. I closed the door halfway. \"Well.\" Elsie took a deep breath and the bathing suit swelled in front. \"Thanks for the glasses,\" she said as if she were thanking me for something else. I closed the door behind her and gasped dizzily. \"Get in that backyard!\" Elsie screamed. I jumped so sharply I banged my knee against the door. As I bent over, rubbing it, I heard Candy outside in the alley, whining. When Elsie was gone I sank down at the table and closed my eyes. I felt as if I\u0027d just climbed out of a well. I tried to tell myself it was only imagination but that didn\u0027t work. Mind ran second again, poor competition for my emotions. I felt dazed and weakened. On the surface that was senseless. Elsie was quite ordinary, not very attractive. She\u0027d never bothered me before. I\u0027d always felt slightly amused by her antics. I wasn\u0027t amused now. I almost felt afraid of her. And, no matter how I went about it, there was only one explanation. I\u0027d seen behind her words, behind her actions. Somehow I\u0027d been inside her mind. It was an awful place.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stir-of-echoes/page-4.html","bookId":2543,"book":{"id":2543,"title":"A Stir of Echoes","description":"Storyline: Tom Wallace lived an ordinary life, until a chance event awakened psychic abilities he never knew he possessed.
