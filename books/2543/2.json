{"id":110747,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"FIRST OF ALL, PHIL ASKED THAT ALL THE lights be put out except for one dim wall lamp over the fireplace. Then he had me stretch out on the sofa while Ron went into the kitchen to get extra chairs. Gradually, everyone settled down. When the rustlings, comments and coughs had finally ceased, Phil spoke. \"Now I can\u0027t promise anything,\" he said. \"You mean we\u0027re going through all this for nothing?\" Elsie asked. \"Some people are harder to hypnotize than others, that\u0027s all,\" Phil said. \"I don\u0027t know about Tom. But you, for instance, Elsie, would be a good subject, I\u0027m sure.\" \"Flattery will get you nowhere,\" Elsie said. \"You just hypnotize your brother-in-law.\" Phil turned back to me. \"All right, brother man, you ready?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir, Mr. Cagliostro.\" Phil pointed at me. \"You just watch out,\" he said, \"I have a feeling you\u0027re going to be a good subject.\" \"That\u0027s me,\" I said. \"Okay.\" Phil shifted in his chair. \"Now everybody get quiet, please. Any distraction will break it up until the actual hypnosis takes place.\" He leaned forward and held out his forefinger again. \"Look at it,\" he said to me. \"Fine looking finger,\" I said. Frank snickered. \"Quiet, please,\" Phil said. He held the finger about six inches from my eyes. \"Look at it,\" he said. \"Keep looking at it. Don\u0027t look at anything else, just my finger.\" \"Why, what\u0027s it gonna do?\" I asked. \"Poke you right in the eye if you don\u0027t fermez your big fat bouche.\" Phil jabbed the finger at me and I shut my eyes instinctively. \"All right,\" Phil said, \"open \u0027em up. Let\u0027s try again.\" \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"Now look at the finger. Just the finger. Don\u0027t look at anything else. Keep looking at the finger, the finger. I don\u0027t want you to look at anything but the finger.\" \"Your nail is dirty,\" I said. Everybody laughed. Phil sank back in his chair with a grimace and pressed his thumb and forefinger to his eyes. \"Like I said,\" he said, \"a lousy subject.\" He looked over at Elsie. \"How about it?\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure I could hypnotize you.\" \"Uh-uh.\" Elsie shook her close-cropped head vigorously. \"Let him try, Elsie,\" Ron said. \"No-o.\" Elsie glared at him as if he\u0027d suggested something vile. \"Come on, champ,\" I said to Phil, \"let\u0027s put me under now.\" \"You gonna play it straight,\" he asked, \"or you gonna play it for the gallery?\" \"I\u0027ll be good, sir, Mr. Mesmer, sir.\" \"You will like...\" Phil leaned forward again, then settled back. \"Well, let\u0027s forget the finger,\" he said. \"Close your eyes.\" \"Close my eyes,\" I said. I did. \"Dark, isn\u0027t it?\" said Frank. I opened my eyes. \"Not now,\" I said. \"Will you close your eyes, you clunk,\" Phil said. I did. I took a deep breath and settled back on the pillow. I could hear the slight breathings and chair-creaking\u0027s of the others. \"All right,\" said Phil, \"I want you to listen to me now.\" I pretended to snore. I heard Elsie\u0027s explosive giggle; then I opened my eyes and looked at Phil\u0027s disgusted face. \"All right, all right,\" I promised, \"I\u0027ll be good.\" I closed my eyes. \"Go ahead,\" I said, \"I\u0027ll be good.\" \"Honest Indian?\" Phil enunciated. \"That\u0027s pretty strong language to use in the company of these fine women,\" I said. \"However, honest, as you say, Indian.\" \"All right. Shut your eyes then, you bum.\" \"Now that\u0027s a poor way to win my confidence,\" I said. \"How am I supposed to venerate you when you talk to me like that? Alan Porter doesn\u0027t-\" \"Will you shut your fat eyes?\" Phil interrupted. \"Shut. Shut,\" I said. \"You may fire when griddy, Redley.\" Phil took a deep and weary breath. \"Oh, well,\" he said. Then he started talking again. \"I want you to pretend you\u0027re in a theatre,\" he said. \"An enormous theatre. You\u0027re sitting near the front. It\u0027s completely black inside.\" Across the room I heard Elizabeth\u0027s slight, apologetic throat-clearing. \"There\u0027s no light in the theatre,\" Phil went on. \"It\u0027s completely dark-like black velvet. The walls are covered with black velvet. The seats are all made of black velvet.\" \"Expensive,\" I said. They all laughed. \"Oh... shoot,\" Phil said. I opened my eyes and grinned at him. \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"Oh... the heck you are.\" \"Yes, I am. I am.\" I closed my eyes tight. \"See? See? I\u0027m back in the theatre again. I\u0027m in the loges. What\u0027s playing?\" \"You are a son of a b,\" said Phil. \"Sir,\" I said, \"control. Go ahead. If I don\u0027t stay quiet, I give you permission to hit me on the head.\" \"Don\u0027t think I won\u0027t,\" Phil said. \"Someone hand me that lamp.\" He was quiet a moment. Then he said, \"You really want to go on with it?\" \"Brother man,\" I said. \"You...\" Phil cleared his throat. \"All right,\" he said, patiently. I won\u0027t go into the complete progression; it took too long. It\u0027s hard to get serious when you\u0027re in a group like that. Especially when Phil and I were so used to heckling each other. I\u0027m afraid I broke up many a moment when he thought he had me. After a while Elsie got bored and went in the kitchen to get food ready. Frank began to talk softly with Anne and direct an occasional, acidulous comment our way. A good hour must have passed and we were still nowhere. I don\u0027t know why Phil kept on. He must have felt I was a challenge. At any rate, he wouldn\u0027t give up. He kept on with that theatre bit and, after a while, Frank stopped talking and watched and, except for a slight clinking of dishes in the kitchen, there was only the monotonous sound of Phil\u0027s voice, talking at me. \"The walls are dark velvet, the floors are covered with dark velvet rugs. It\u0027s black inside, absolutely black. Except for one thing. In the whole pitch-black theatre there\u0027s only one thing you can see. The letters up on the screen. Tall, thin, white letters on the black, black screen. They spell sleep. Sleep. You\u0027re very comfortable, very comfortable. You\u0027re just sitting there and looking at the screen, looking, looking at that single word up there. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.\" I\u0027ll never know what made it begin to work on me unless it was sheer repetition. I suspect my assurance that I couldn\u0027t be hypnotized helped too; an assurance of such illogical magnitude that I took it for granted. I didn\u0027t even try to get hypnotized. To quote Elsie-I just played along with the gag. \"You\u0027re relaxing,\" Phil said. \"Your feet and ankles are relaxed. Your legs are relaxed, so relaxed. Your hands are limp and heavy. Your arms are relaxed, so relaxed. You\u0027re beginning to relax all over. Relax. Relax. You\u0027re going to sleep. To sleep. You\u0027re going to sleep.\" And I was. I started slipping away. By the time I felt the slightest trickle of awareness as to what was happening to me, it was too late. It was as if my mind-or, rather, my volition-were a moth being set into congealing wax. There was a faint fluttering as I tried to escape; but all in vain. I began to feel as I had once when I had an impacted wisdom tooth taken out. The oral surgeon had jabbed a needle into the exposed vein on my left arm. I\u0027d asked him what it was for and he\u0027d said it was to stop excess salivation. I guess that\u0027s what they always say so the patient won\u0027t be afraid. Because it wasn\u0027t for that, it was a fast-acting general anesthetic. The room started weaving around me, everything got watery in front of me, the nurses leaning over me wavered as if I were looking at them through lenses of jelly. And then I woke up; it was that fast. I didn\u0027t even realize when I\u0027d lost consciousness. It seemed as if I\u0027d closed my eyes only a second or two. I\u0027d been out cold for forty-five minutes. It was just like that again. I opened my eyes and saw Phil sitting there grinning at me. I blinked at him. \"What\u0027d I do, doze off?\" I asked. Phil chuckled. I looked around. They were all looking at me in different ways; Frank, curious; Ron, baffled; Elizabeth blank; Elsie half afraid. Anne looked concerned. \"Are you all right, honey?\" she asked me. \"Sure. Why?\" I looked at her a moment. Then I sat up. \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me it took?\" I said, incredulously. \"Did it ever,\" she said, her smile only half amused. \"I was hypnotized?\" That seemed to break the tension. Everybody seemed to talk at once. \"I\u0027ll be damned,\" said Frank. \"My goodness,\" said Elizabeth. Ron shook his head wonderingly. \"Were you really hypnotized?\" Elsie asked. There was very little distrust left in her voice. \"I... guess I was,\" I said. \"You know it,\" Phil said, unable to stop grinning. I looked at Anne again. \"I really was?\" I asked. \"If you weren\u0027t, you\u0027re the best little actor I ever saw,\" she said. \"I never saw anything like it,\" Ron said quietly. \"How do you feel?\" Phil asked me and I knew, from the way he said it, it was a loaded question. \"How should I feel?\" I asked, suspiciously. Phil forced down his grin. \"A little... hot?\" he asked. Suddenly, I realized that I was hot. I ran my hand over my forehead and rubbed away sweat. I felt as if I\u0027d been sitting in the sun too long. \"What did you do-set fire to me?\" I asked. Phil laughed out loud. \"We tried,\" he said, \"but you wouldn\u0027t catch.\" Then he calmly told me that, while I was stretched out like a board between two kitchen chairs, he\u0027d sat on my stomach and run a cigarette lighter flame back and forth along my exposed legs. I just sat there gaping at him. \"Let\u0027s have that again,\" I said. \"That\u0027s right,\" he said, laughing, delighted at his success. I looked over at Anne again. \"This happened?\" I asked, weakly. She got up, smiling, and came over to me. Sitting down she put her arm around me. \"You sure are a dandy subject, love,\" she said. Her voice shook a little when she said it. Ten minutes later we were all sitting around the kitchen table, discussing my hypnotism. I must say it was the first time I\u0027d ever heard an animated discussion in Elsie\u0027s house. \"I didn\u0027t,\" I said, laughing. \"You sure did.\" Anne made an amused sound. \"There you were, twelve years old again, telling us about somebody named Joey Ariola who must have been a beast from the way you talked about him.\" \"Ariola.\" I shook my head wonderingly. \"I\u0027ll be damned. I\u0027d forgotten all about him.\" \"You just thought you\u0027d forgotten,\" Phil said. \"Oh... I don\u0027t believe anybody can remember that far back,\" Elsie said. \"He was just making it up or something.\" \"He could go back a lot farther than that,\" Phil told her. \"There are authenticated cases where subjects go back to prenatal days.\" \"To what?\" \"To before they were born.\" \"Oh...\" Elsie turned her head halfway to the side again. Now that the vision of me stretched calcified between two of her kitchen chairs was beginning to fade, she was regaining dissent. \"That\u0027s right,\" Phil said. \"And there\u0027s Bridey Murphy.\" \"Who?\" asked Elsie. \"A woman who, under hypnosis, claims she was an Irish girl in her previous life.\" \"Oh... that\u0027s silly,\" Elsie said. Everybody was quiet for a moment and Elsie looked up at the clock. She shrugged at Phil. \"It\u0027s not time yet,\" Phil said. \"Time for what?\" I asked. \"You\u0027ll see,\" Phil told me. Elsie got up and went over to the stove. \"Who wants more coffee?\" she asked. I looked at Phil a moment longer, then let it go. \"What else did I say when I was-I mean when I thought I was twelve again?\" I asked Anne. She smiled and shook her head. \"Oh... all sorts of things,\" she said. \"About your father and-your mother. About a bike you wanted that had a foxtail on the handlebars.\" \"Oh, my God, yes,\" I said, delighted at the sudden recollection. \"I remember that. Lord, how I wanted that bike.\" \"I wanted something else when I was twelve,\" said Frank. I noticed how Elizabeth looked down at her coffee, her pale red lips pressed together. Everything about Elizabeth was pale; the shade of her lipstick, the blond of her hair, the colour of her skin. She seemed, in a way, to be partially vanished. \"I wasn\u0027t after any bike at twelve,\" Frank said. \"Man, we know what you were after,\" I said, trying to make it sound like the joke that Frank had not intended it to be. \"What else did I talk about?\" I asked Anne before Frank could say any more. I noticed Ron looking up at the clock now, then glancing over at Phil. Phil pressed down a grin-as did Frank. Elsie came back to the table and put down another plate of little glazed cakes. \"Well, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to happen,\" she said. \"It\u0027s already eleven.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" I asked. \"Let\u0027s see,\" Anne said as if I hadn\u0027t spoken, \"you talked about your sister and-about your room. About your dog.\" For a second I remembered Corky and the way he had of putting his old shaggy head on my knees and staring at me. \"What\u0027s the joke?\" I asked, because there was one obviously. \"Why are you all looking like cats who swallowed the mice?\" At which point I took off my left shoe and put it into the refrigerator. I turned to face their explosion of laughter. For a moment I actually didn\u0027t know what they were laughing about. Then, suddenly, I realized what I\u0027d just done. I opened the refrigerator and peered in at my dark shoe placed neatly beside a covered bowl of peas. \"What\u0027d you do that for?\" Phil asked, innocently. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I-just wanted to, I guess. Why shouldn\u0027t-?\" I stopped abruptly and looked at Phil accusingly. \"You crumb, you,\" I said, \"you gave me a post-hypnotic command.\" Phil grinned, returned to glory again. \"He told you,\" Elsie declared. \"You knew just what you were doing.\" \"No, I didn\u0027t,\" I said. \"You did so,\" said Elsie, pettishly. \"Say,\" said Frank, \"what if Tom was a girl and you gave her the post-hypnotic command to-oh, well, never mind, my wife doesn\u0027t like that kind of talk. Do you, Lizzie old girl?\" \"He\u0027s always making fun of me,\" she answered with attempted lightness. Her smile was pale too. \"I hope you didn\u0027t give me any other post-hypnotic suggestions, you idiot,\" I said. Phil shook his head with a smile. \"Nope,\" he said, \"that\u0027s all, brother man. It\u0027s over.\" Famous last words.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stir-of-echoes/page-2.html","bookId":2543,"book":{"id":2543,"title":"A Stir of Echoes","description":"Storyline: Tom Wallace lived an ordinary life, until a chance event awakened psychic abilities he never knew he possessed.
