{"id":110763,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"WITH A GASP I LEAPED OFF THE PORCH onto the cold, wet grass and raced toward the curb. I was halfway across the street when the second shot exploded in the night. I clamped my teeth together and tried to run faster. I leaped the curb and rushed across their lawn. The light from a single lamp illuminated their living room. Alan was wrong. For some reason that was the first thing I thought as I jolted to a halt and stared in through the window. Because Frank was lying crumpled on the living room floor- in exactly the position I\u0027d seen him in that day. Everything was the same; the twisted pain on his face, the eyes staring, the blood pulsing across the front of his white shirt. There was one difference. Elizabeth stood like a statue in the hall doorway, the Luger held in her hand, on her face a wild and stricken look. In the silence I could hear the clicking sound as she pulled the trigger again and again. When I ran in, her head snapped around and she stared at me an instant before pitching forward on the rug without a sound. I heard the Luger thump on the rug. After that it was all movement and confusion. I ran to Frank and knelt beside him, feeling for a heartbeat. It was there; faintly. Only one of the bullets had struck him, it appeared, but it was a bad chest wound. I pushed up, the blood pulsing at my temples, and stepped quickly over Elizabeth. In the hall closet I found clean sheets and pulled one out. As I stepped across Elizabeth again I flung the sheet open and folded it lengthwise. Then, kneeling by Frank, I wrapped it around him as gently as I could. He groaned softly while I was doing it. He was unconscious now, his eyes closed. The next thing I did was run into the hall and phone for an ambulance. That done, I managed to get the dead weight of Elizabeth on the couch. Her face was waxen and cool to the touch. I opened the collar of her pajama top and began chafing her wrists. I was doing this when her eyes flickered open. She stared at me a moment as if she\u0027d never seen me in her life. Then, abruptly, she pushed up. \"Frank!\" she gasped. I held her back. \"Lie down, Elizabeth, lie down,\" I told her. \"No. No.\" She fought me, her eyes on Frank, her shoulders pressing violently against my hands. She kept saying Frank\u0027s name. Then, suddenly, the strength seemed to empty from her and she fell back on the couch pillow. Her eyes closed tightly and a long, wavering sigh passed her pale lips. I didn\u0027t realize what was happening. I was checking Frank again when I heard footsteps outside. I thought it was Anne but it turned out to be the man who lived in the house on the right. \"What happ-?\" he started to say, then stopped, his mouth open. \"Holy Christ,\" he muttered slowly. He stood there staring at Frank. In\u0027 a short while Anne did come, wearing her topcoat. Her only reaction was to look blankly at Frank a moment, then at me. Then she sat down beside Elizabeth and took her hand. I heard Elizabeth\u0027s dry, breathless sobbing as I tightened the sheet to stop the bleeding. The ambulance came five minutes later. The police a few minutes after that. When we got back to the house, I went into the bathroom to wash my hands. I saw the half-filled sink and, gritting my teeth, I turned to go into the kitchen. I tried to hide my blood stained fingers from Anne as I walked past her. She didn\u0027t speak. I heard the clock strike one as I went in the kitchen. It had been an incredible night. And Alan had said I would probably have nothing to worry about now. There was a grotesque amusement to that. I was drying my hands when I heard a rustling sound and, looking over my shoulder, I saw Anne standing in the kitchen doorway looking at me. I turned back and hung up the towel. I wondered what she was going to say to me now. There was not much left in the way of shocks for her. As I turned from the sink I saw her sit down at the table. I started to walk, then stopped. I leaned back against the sink and we looked at each other. Finally she spoke. \"Will he die?\" she asked, quietly. It was not what I\u0027d expected to hear. For a moment I could only stare at her. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said then. I saw her throat move. \"You know,\" she said. \"You just don\u0027t want to tell me.\" \"No,\" I said, \"I don\u0027t know. I thought... Elizabeth was going to.\" She lowered her eyes. I looked at her a few moments. Then I went over and sat down across from her. \"Look, Anne. I think you know-at least I hope you know how badly all of this makes me feel. I\u0027m not a monster, Anne. I\u0027m still the same man you married; believe me. I hate to frighten you. I hate to have all these things happen at a time like this. But I can\u0027t help it. Can\u0027t you see this? Do you think I\u0027m doing this deliberately? Do you think I\u0027m trying to hurt you? What\u0027s happened to me wasn\u0027t my doing. I\u0027m just as victimized by it as you are. I don\u0027t know what it means or why it should happen to me. But it is happening, Anne. I\u0027ve faced that fact. It\u0027s established. And it isn\u0027t going to stop. I feel certain of that. I can\u0027t imagine what could end it now. It\u0027s a part of me. What else can I say? If only you\u0027d accept that; not fight it so hard. It isn\u0027t frightening if only you accept it. Believe that, Anne. It isn\u0027t terrible then. It can only hurt you if you struggle against it, if you believe it\u0027s something unnatural and wrong. Can\u0027t you see that?\" I must have sounded pretty impassioned because she looked at me now with sympathy, almost with understanding. Then it faded. \"What about us?\" she asked. \"Is it going to be-the same? Can it be the same when you\u0027re like this? Isn\u0027t every day going to be a-a new torture? What if... Tom, what if you start seeing things about me, about us? I\u0027d know it, Tom, I would. You couldn\u0027t hide it, you couldn\u0027t pretend you hadn\u0027t seen them.\" She shook her head in short, choppy movements. \"How could it work? Life would be unbearable. I\u0027d just be-waiting for something terrible to happen.\" \"Honey, what happened would have happened anyway. I didn\u0027t cause anything. Is that what you\u0027ve been thinking? How could you? I was aware that they would happen-but I didn\u0027t make them happen. Can\u0027t you see that?\" She clasped her hands together tightly and looked at them. She bit her lower lip. \"I suppose you\u0027re right, but...\" She looked up at me. \"Are you reading my mind now?\" she asked. \"Anne, I-\" I felt almost speechless. \"What in God\u0027s name do you think I am, a wizard? No, of course I\u0027m not reading your mind now. I probably couldn\u0027t do it if I tried. I told you it was different now. Before it was beyond volition; I picked up things. Now I\u0027d have to concentrate. I don\u0027t know what you think it is I can do. But... well, believe me, it\u0027s not as fantastic as all that. You aren\u0027t... naked to my mind. Nothing is. I-I... I just don\u0027t know what to say, Anne.\" Breath emptied from her slowly. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I... just don\u0027t know either. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m up to it. To live like this every day.\" She shook her head. \"Honey, it wouldn\u0027t be like this every day. Is... Elizabeth going to shoot her husband every day? Is your... mother...?\" I didn\u0027t finish. \"What about the woman?\" she asked. \"Helen Driscoll, if that\u0027s who it is.\" \"That\u0027s something that has to be settled,\" I admitted, \"but... well, once it is settled...\" \"And you think you can settle it?\" \"I\u0027m going to try, Anne.\" She was silent. I could hear the clock ticking hollowly in the cupboard. I sat there a minute. Then I started to get up. \"If I do try,\" she broke in. I sat down and looked at her. \"If I try,\" she said, \"will you... tell me everything? Everything,\u0027 Tom?\" \"I have told you-\" \"I mean everything,\" she said. \"Even about us.\" \"If you want me to,\" I said, \"of course I will.\" I reached across the table and took her hand. \"I just want you to be with me,\" I said. \"I just don\u0027t want you to run away from it anymore. I need you, Anne. That hasn\u0027t changed.\" She tried to smile. \"I\u0027ve written to my aunt,\" I said. \"I should hear from her soon. Then we\u0027ll know if-there\u0027s something more to go on. That will make it easier for you, won\u0027t it? If you know that it\u0027s something in the family?\" She hesitated a moment. Then her hand squeezed mine. \"I\u0027ll try, Tom,\" she said. \"I... can\u0027t say anything more. I think it will frighten me to death but I\u0027ll try.\" We sat in silence a moment. Then she asked, \"Will he die, Tom?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Anne,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the truth. The sense of death I got had to do with Elizabeth, not Frank. I don\u0027t understand that really. But... well, it must be him.\" She looked at me intently. I saw how she bit her lower lip. \"Tom,\" she said. \"What?\" \"Wh... what about me?\" \"Honey, I don\u0027t know anything about you-or us.\" Then I remembered. I smiled at her. \"Unless...\" She looked frightened. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"Would it make you feel too badly,\" I said, \"if I told you I think we\u0027re going to have a girl?\" She looked at me, speechless. Then there was a softening around her eyes, a stirring at the corners of her mouth. \"Really?\" she murmured. I held her hands in mine. \"I think so,\" I said. \"Does that spoil it? To know, I mean?\" I don\u0027t think she heard me. She was looking into the future. \"A girl,\" she said. \"A little baby girl.\" The next afternoon when I came home from work Elsie was on her lawn, watering the grass. As I pulled into the driveway she came over. \"Isn\u0027t it awful?\" she said. I must have looked blank a moment. \"Oh,\" I said then, \"yes. Yes, it is awful.\" \"We\u0027re all so shocked,\" she said. \"Such a terrible thing. Oooh\" I recognized her shudder. It was the same one she\u0027d affected the night Phil had told her about sticking hatpins into the throats of hypnotized subjects. \"Why should she do such a thing?\" Elsie asked, \"I thought they were so happy.\" I didn\u0027t need telepathy or any kindred perception to sense plain old female curiosity. \"I really don\u0027t know Elsie,\" I said. Elsie clucked. \"It\u0027s so shocking,\" she said. \"Yes.\" I turned away. \"Especially about the baby,\" she said. For a split second I broke stride and almost stopped. The pleasure I\u0027d felt at not being exposed to her mind was washed away in an instant. \"The-\" I started to say, then walked quickly around the corner of the house and went inside. Anne was in the kitchen scrubbing potatoes. \"The baby?\" I asked after I\u0027d kissed her. She nodded sadly. \"This morning,\" she said. \"I guess it was the shock. She miscarried.\" \"Oh...\" I felt sick. The vision had been true after all; the death had concerned Elizabeth. More terribly than even I had imagined. \"That poor kid,\" I said. \"Yes, now she\u0027s lost everything.\" We were silent a moment. \"Then Frank didn\u0027t die,\" I said. Anne shook her head. \"No, he\u0027ll live.\" Her lips pressed together bitterly. \"He\u0027ll live.\" We picked up Elizabeth at the hospital two days later. There was no relative to take her home and Frank was still in the hospital. There were no criminal charges against her. Frank had told the police it had been an accident; that they hadn\u0027t known the gun was loaded. I guess he felt he had to make amends somewhere-ineffectual as they were. She was completely uncommunicative when we got to her ward and when we walked her to the car. Anne and I were on each side of her. She walked in slow, faltering steps; as if, overnight, she had become old and infirm. The ride home was mostly silent. Anne\u0027s attempted conversation regarding weather and other innocuous subjects was received either in silence or answered in words so soft they couldn\u0027t be heard. It was during that drive home that I got some of the most awful mental impressions of the entire affair. The most hideous of moments, I discovered then, could take place in bright sunlight, in the most mundane of locations. Night is not a requirement; nor are thunderstorms, high winds or the rain lashed battlements of mad doctors. There were no monsters here; just three human beings. No strange creatures of darkness. No eerie sound or sight. Yet I will never forget the wrenching sickness it gave me. The feeling came from Elizabeth; of that there was not the least doubt. It began slowly; as a strengthless remorse, a despair, a pitiful longing. It did not remain so very long. Gradually it grew, shooting out tendrils of naked emotion, growing into a horrible weed like mass of cruel hunger. Higher and higher it mounted. I didn\u0027t have to concentrate on it. Emotions that strong overpower you. The emotion of clutching demand, of cold, animal desire, frightening in its intensity. When the image burst across my mind, I felt myself twitch on the car seat and my hands clamped on the wheel until the blood was forced from them. The vision was of Elizabeth. She was reaching down with talon like, trembling hands. She was clawing at Anne\u0027s loins. She was ripping open Anne\u0027s flesh and tearing loose the child in bloody shreds. She was screaming and screaming. She was tearing her own stitched flesh open-and placing our child inside her body. I was glad when we got home. Anne wanted to stay with her but Elizabeth said she\u0027d rather be alone. I felt glad about that. As we walked across the porch we heard her lock the door. \"Tom, will she-do anything to herself?\" Anne asked. There was a childlike trust in her voice now; a trust in my ability as a man who could see everything. I started to answer that she might, then stopped. I knew I had no right to say it. I had no idea what Elizabeth might do. \"I don\u0027t know, Anne,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t tell. I told you, I\u0027m not a wizard.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" She took my arm. \"I should stay with her, though.\" \"She\u0027ll be all right,\" I said. When we got to the house, Anne went next door to Elsie\u0027s to see if Richard was still playing all right with Candy. I went up on the porch. The letter was in the mailbox. I took it into the living room and read it. I think I smiled a little. It was really an anticlimax now. When Anne came back, I handed it to her. I saw her lips part as she read it. \"Your grandfather,\" she said quietly. \"Great-grandfather,\" I said. \"Castor James Wallace of Yorkshire, England. Funny; I\u0027d forgotten all about him. I think my mother told me about him when I was a little boy.\" \"So he was a medium,\" Anne said. \"Apparently.\" After a few moments, Anne folded the letter and put it into her pocket. \"Well?\" I said. She blew out a soft breath. \"Well,\" she said, \"I guess that\u0027s it then.\" \"Do you accept it?\" I asked. \"Can you live with it now?\u0027 Anne sighed. She looked helpless. \"You\u0027re my husband, Madame Wallace,\" she said. I hugged her until she groaned. \"Easy on Sam,\" she said. \"He doesn\u0027t like the pressure.\" \"Sandra,\" I said. I rubbed my cheek against her soft hair. I remembered she\u0027d asked me to tell her everything. Well, I wasn\u0027t going to tell her what had been going through Elizabeth\u0027s mind. I knew that I might have to temper my promise in the future. There were lies and there were lies. \"Well,\" she said, after a few moments, \"what now?\" \"One more thing,\" I said. \"It has to be settled.\" \"Helen Driscoll?\" she asked. I nodded. \"Helen Driscoll,\" I said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stir-of-echoes/page-18.html","bookId":2543,"book":{"id":2543,"title":"A Stir of Echoes","description":"Storyline: Tom Wallace lived an ordinary life, until a chance event awakened psychic abilities he never knew he possessed.
