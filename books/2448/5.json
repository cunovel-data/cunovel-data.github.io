She wanted to wait, think it over and discuss it with her doctor, but I told her it was now or never. \" Vancha and I have a mission to complete,\" I reminded her. \"We might not be able to come back later.\"\\n\\n When we\u0027d first discussed the transfusion, Vancha had volunteered. He didn\u0027t think it was safe for me to try. I was in the middle of the purge - my vampire cells were taking over, turning me into a full-vampire, and my body was in a state of flux. But when I pressed him, he admitted there was no real reason for thinking that the purge would have any effect on the procedure. It might even work in our favour - since my vampire cells were hyperactive, they might stand a better chance of destroying the vampaneze cells.\\n\\n We\u0027d tried to quiz Evanna about the dangers. She could look into the future and tell us whether it would succeed or not. But she refused to be drawn. \"This has nothing to do with me,\" she\u0027d said. \"I will not comment on it.\"\\n\\n \"But it must be safe,\" I\u0027d pressed, hoping for reassurance. \"We\u0027re destined to meet Steve again. We can\u0027t do that if I die.\"\\n\\n \"Your final encounter with Steve Leonard is by no means set in stone,\" she\u0027d replied. \"If you die beforehand, he will become the Lord of the Shadows by default and the war will swing the way of the vampaneze. Do not think you are immune to danger because of your destiny, Darren - youcan and perhapswill die if you attempt this.\"\\n\\n But Darius was my nephew. Vancha didn\u0027t approve - he would have preferred to overlook Darius for the time being, and focus on Steve - but I couldn\u0027t leave the boy this way, with such a threat hanging over him. If I could save him, I must.\\n\\n We could have handled the blood transfer with syringes, but Darius insisted on the traditional fingertips method. He was excited, despite the danger, and wanted to do it the old way. \"If I\u0027m going to be a vampire, I want to be a real one,\" he growled. \"I don\u0027t want to hide my marks. It\u0027s all or nothing.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027ll be painful,\" I warned him.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" he sniffed.\\n\\n Annie\u0027s doubts remained, burin the end she agreed to the plan. She might not have if Darius had wavered, but he stuck to his guns with grim determination. I hated to admit it - and I didn\u0027t say it out loud - but he had his father\u0027s sense of commitment. Steve was insanely evil, but he always did what he set out to do, and nothing could change his mind once he\u0027d made it up. Darius was the same.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe this is happening,\" Annie sighed as I sat opposite Darius and prepared to drive my nails into the tips of his fingers. \"Earlier tonight I was only thinking about doing the shopping tomorrow, and being here to let Darius in when he got home from school. Then my brother walks back into my life and tells me he\u0027s a vampire! And now, as I\u0027m just getting used to that, I might lose him as swiftly as I found him - and my son too!\"\\n\\n She almost called it off then, but Alice stepped up behind her and said softly, \"Would you rather lose him when he\u0027s human, or when he\u0027s a killer like his father?\" It was a cruel thing to say, but it steadied Annie\u0027s nerves and reminded her of what was at stake. Trembling fiercely, weeping quietly, she stepped away and let me proceed.\\n\\n Without any warning, I dug my nails into the soft flesh at the tips of Darius\u0027s fingers. He yelped painfully and jerked back in his chair. \"Don\u0027t,\" I said as he raised his fingers to his mouth to suck them. \"Let them bleed.\"\\n\\n Darius lowered his hands. Gritting my teeth, I dug my right-hand nails into my left-hand fingertips, then did it the other way round. Blood welled up from ten fleshy springs. I pressed my fingers against Darius\u0027s and held them there while my blood flowed into his body, and his into mine.\\n\\n We remained locked for twenty seconds... thirty... more. I could feel the vampaneze cells as soon as his blood entered my veins, itching, burning, sizzling. I ignored the pain. I could see that Darius was also aware of the change, and that it was hurting him more than me. I pressed closer against him, so it was impossible for him to break away.\\n\\n Vancha stood guard, observing us, calculating. When he thought the time was right, he grabbed my arms and pulled my hands away. I gasped out loud, stood, half smiled, then fell to the floor, writhing in agony. I hadn\u0027t expected the cells to kick in so soon, and was unprepared for the brutal speed of the reaction.\\n\\n During my convulsions, I saw Darius twisting sharply in his chair, eyes bulging, making choking noises, arms and legs thrashing wildly. Annie hurried towards him but Vancha knocked her aside. \"Don\u0027t interfere!\" he barked. \"Nature must take its course. We can\u0027t get in its way.\"\\n\\n For several minutes I jackknifed wildly on the floor. It felt like I was on fire inside my skin. I\u0027d experienced blinding headaches and loads of discomfort during the purge, but this took me to new heights of pain. Pressure built at the back of my eyes, as though my brain was going to bulge out through my eye sockets. I dug the heels of my hands hard into my eyes, then into the sides of my head. I don\u0027t know if I was roaring or wheezing - I could hear nothing.\\n\\n I vomited, then dry-heaved. I crashed into something hard - the TV I rolled away from it and smashed into a wall. I dug my nails into the plaster and brick, trying to make the pain go away.\\n\\n Finally the pressure subsided. My limbs relaxed. I stopped dry-heaving. Sight and sound returned, though my fierce headache remained. I looked around, dazed. Vancha was crouching over me, wiping my face clean, smiling. \"You\u0027ve come through it,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll be OK - with the luck of the vampires.\"\\n\\n \"Darius?\" I gasped.\\n\\n Vancha raised my head and pointed. Darius was lying on the couch, eyes closed, perfectly still, Annie and Alice kneeling beside him. Evanna sat in a corner, head bowed. For a horrifying moment I thought Darius was dead. Then I saw his chest lift softly and fall, and I knew he was just asleep.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be fine,\" Vancha said. \"We\u0027ll have to keep a close eye on the two of you for a few nights. You\u0027ll probably have further fits, less severe than this one. But most who attempt this die of the first seizure. Having survived that, the odds are good for both of you.\"\\n\\n I sat up wearily. Vancha took my fingers and spat on them, rubbing his spit in to help close the wounds.\\n\\n \"I feel awful,\" I moaned.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t improve any time soon,\" Vancha said. \"When I turned from vampanizm to vampirism it took my system a month to settle down, and almost a year to get back to normal. And you\u0027ve got the purge to contend with too.\" He chuckled wryly. \"You\u0027re in for some rough nights, Sire!\"\\n\\n Vancha helped me back to my chair. Alice asked if I\u0027d like water or milk to drink. Vancha said blood would be better for me. Without blinking, Alice used a knife to cut herself and let me feed directly from the wound. Vancha closed the cut with his spit when I was finished. He beamed up at Alice. \"You\u0027re some woman, Miss Burgess.\"\\n\\n \"The best,\" Alice replied dryly.\\n\\n I leant back, eyes half closed. \"I could sleep for a week,\" I sighed.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you?\" Vancha said. \"You\u0027ve only recently recovered from a life-threatening wound. You\u0027re in the middle of the purge. You\u0027ve pulled off the most dangerous blood transfusion known to vampires. By the black blood of Harnon Oan, you\u0027ve earned a rest!\"\\n\\n \"But Steve...\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"Leonard can wait,\" Vancha grunted. \"We\u0027ll send Annie land Darius out of town �C Alice will escort them �C then get you settled in at the Cirque. A week in your hammock will do you the world of good.\"\\n\\n \"I guess,\" I said unhappily. I was thinking about Evra and Merla, and what I could find to say to them. There was Mr Tall to consider too �C everyone at the Cirque Du Freak had loved him. Like Shancus, he was dead because of his association with me. Would the people there hate me because of that?\\n\\n \"Who do you think will take over from Mr Tall?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no idea,\" Vancha said. \"I don\u0027t think anybody ever expected him to die, certainly not in such sudden circumstances.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe they\u0027ll break up,\" I mused. \"Go their own ways, back to whatever they did before they joined. Some might have left the stadium already. I hope-\"\\n\\n \"What was that about a stadium?\" Annie interrupted. She was still tending to Darius �C he was snoring lightly �C but she\u0027d overheard us talking.\\n\\n \"The Cirque Du Freak\u0027s camped in the old football stadium,\" I explained. \"We\u0027re going back there when you leave, but I was saying to Vancha that-\"\\n\\n \"The news,\" Annie interrupted again. \"You didn\u0027t see tonight\u0027s news?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I was watching it when you came in,\" she said, eyes filling with fresh worry. \"I didn\u0027t know that\u0027s where you were based, so I didn\u0027t connect it with you.\"\\n\\n \"Connect what?\" I asked edgily.\\n\\n \"Police have surrounded the stadium,\" Annie said. \"They say the people who killed Tom Jones and the others at the football match are there. I should have put it together earlier, when you were telling me about Tommy, but...\" She shook her head angrily, then continued. \"They\u0027re not letting anyone in or out. When I was watching the news, they hadn\u0027t moved in yet. But they said that when they did, they\u0027d go in with full, lethal force. One of the reporters-\" She stopped.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" I said hoarsely.\\n\\n \"He said he\u0027d never seen so many armed police before. He...\" She gulped and finished in a whisper. \"He said they meant to go in as hard as they could. He said it looked like they planned to kill everyone inside.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-5.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \\n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
