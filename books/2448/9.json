{"id":79800,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"Halt!\" one of the nine vampaneze in front of Steve shouted when we were about five metres away. We stopped. This close, I saw that Steve was actually standing on the body of one of the circus crew ¨C Pasta O\u0027Malley, a man who used to sleepwalk and even sleep-read. I could also see Gannen Harst now, just to Steve\u0027s right, sword undrawn, watching us intently.\n \"Drop your throwing stars,\" the vampaneze said to Vancha. When he didn\u0027t respond, two of the vampaneze raised spears and pointed them at him. With a shrug, Vancha slid the shurikens back into their holders and lowered his hands.\n I glanced up at Shancus, swinging in the light breeze. The crossbeam creaked. The sound was louder than normal for me because of the purge ¨C like the squeal of a wild boar.\n \"Get him down,\" I snarled at Steve.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Steve replied lightly. \"I like the sight of him up there. Maybe I\u0027ll hang his parents beside him. His brother and sister too. Keep the whole family together. What do you think?\"\n \"Why do you go along with this madman?\" Vancha asked Gannen Harst. \"I don\u0027t care what Des Tiny says about him ¨C this lunatic can bring nothing but shame upon the vampaneze. You should have killed him years ago.\"\n \"He is of our blood,\" Gannen Harst replied quietly. \"I don\u0027t agree with his ways ¨C he knows that ¨C but we don\u0027t kill our kin.\"\n \"You do if they break your laws,\" Vancha grunted. \"Leonard lies and uses guns. Any normal vampaneze would be executed if they did that.\"\n \"But he isn\u0027t normal,\" Gannen said. \"He is our Lord. Desmond Tiny said we would perish if we did not follow him and obey. Whether I like it or not, Steve has the power to bend our laws, or even ignore them completely. I\u0027d rather he didn\u0027t, but it\u0027s not my place to chastise him when he does.\"\n \"You can\u0027t approve of his actions,\" Vancha pushed.\n \"No,\" Gannen admitted. \"But he has been accepted by the clan, and I am only a servant of my people. History can judge Steve. I\u0027m content to serve and protect, in line with the wishes of those who appointed me.\"\n Vancha glared at his brother, trying to stare him down, but Gannen only gazed back blankly. Then Steve laughed. \"Aren\u0027t family get-togethers a joy?\" he said. \"I was hoping you\u0027d bring Annie and Darius along. Imagine the fun all six of us could have had!\"\n \"They\u0027re far away from here by now,\" I said. I wanted to pe for him and rip his throat open with my bare hands and teeth, but his guards would have cut me down before I struck. I had to be patient and pray for a chance to present itself. \"How\u0027s my son?\" Steve asked. \"Did you kill him?\"\n \"Of course not,\" I snorted. \"I didn\u0027t have to. When he saw you murder Shancus he realized you were a monster. I filled him in on your past glories . Annie told him some old stories too. He\u0027ll never listen to you again. You\u0027ve lost him. He\u0027s your son no more.\"\n I hoped to wound Steve with my words but he just laughed them off. \"Oh well, I was never that fond of him anyway. A scrawny, moody kid. No taste for blood. Although,\" he chuckled, \"I guess he\u0027ll develop one soon!\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t be too sure of that,\" I retorted.\n \"I blooded him,\" Steve boasted. \"He\u0027s half-vampaneze.\"\n \"No,\" I smiled. \"He\u0027s a half-vampire. Like me.\"\n Steve stared at me uncertainly. \"You re-blooded him?\"\n \"Yes. He\u0027s one of us now. He won\u0027t need to kill when he feeds. Like I said, he\u0027s no longer your son ¨C in any way whatsoever.\"\n Steve\u0027s features darkened. \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that,\" he growled. \"The boy was mine.\"\n \"He was never yours, not in spirit,\" I said. \"You merely tricked him into believing he was.\"\n Steve started to reply, then scowled and shook his head gruffly. \"Never mind,\" he muttered. \"The child\u0027s not important. I\u0027ll deal with him ¨C and his mother ¨C later. Let\u0027s get down to the good stuff. We all know the prophecy.\" He nodded at Mr Tiny, who was wandering around the burning tents and vans, paying no apparent interest to us. \"Darren or Vancha will kill me, or I\u0027ll kill one of you, and that will decide the fate of the War of the Scars.\"\n \"If Tiny\u0027s right, or telling the truth, aye,\" Vancha sniffed.\n \"You don\u0027t believe him?\" Steve frowned.\n \"Not entirely,\" Vancha said. \"Tiny and his daughter-\" He glared at Evanna -\"have agendas of their own. I accept most of what they predict but I don\u0027t treat their predictions as absolute facts.\"\n \"Then why are you here?\" Steve challenged him.\n \"In case they are correct.\"\n Steve looked confused. \"How can you not believe them? Desmond Tiny is the voice of destiny. He sees the future. He knows all that has been and will be.\"\n \"We make our own futures,\" Vancha said. \"Regardless of what happens tonight, I believe my people will defeat yours. But I\u0027ll kill you anyway,\" he added with a wicked grin. \"Just to be on the safe side.\"\n \"You\u0027re an ignorant fool,\" Steve said, shaking with outrage. Then his gaze settled on me. \"I bet you believe the prophecy.\"\n \"Maybe,\" I replied.\n \"Of course you do,\" Steve smiled. \"And you know it\u0027s you or me, don\u0027t you? Vancha\u0027s a red herring. You and I are the sons of destiny, the ruler and slave, the victor and vanquished. Leave Vancha behind, step up here alone, and I swear it will be a fair fight. You and me, man to man, one winner, one loser. A Vampaneze Lord to rule the night ¨C or a Vampire Prince.\"\n \"How can I trust you?\" I asked. \"You\u0027re a liar. You\u0027ll spring a trap.\"\n \"No,\" Steve barked. \"You have my word.\"\n \"Like that means anything,\" I jeered, but I could see an eagerness in Steve\u0027s expression. His offer was genuine. I glanced sideways at Vancha. \"What do you think?\"\n \"No,\" Vancha said. \"We\u0027re in this together. We\u0027ll take him on as a team.\"\n \"But if he\u0027s prepared to fight me fairly...\"\n \"That demon knows nothing about fairness,\" Vancha said. \"He\u0027d cheat ¨C that\u0027s his nature. We\u0027ll do nothing the way he wants.\"\n \"Very well.\" I faced Steve again. \"Stuff your offer. What next?\"\n I thought Steve was going to leap over the ranks of vampaneze and attack me. He gnashed his teeth, hands twisted together, shivering furiously. Gannen Harst saw it too, but to my surprise, rather than step in to calm Steve down, he took a half-step back. It was as if he wanted Steve to leap, like he\u0027d had enough of his insane, evil Lord, and wanted this matter settled, one way or the other.\n But just when it seemed as if the moment of final confrontation had come, Steve relaxed and his smile returned. \"I do my best,\" he sighed. \"I try to make it easy for everybody, but some people are determined not to play ball. Very well. Here\u0027s \u0027what next\u0027.\"\n Steve put his fingers to his lips and whistled sharply. From behind the gallows, R.V. stepped out. The bearded, ex-eco-warrior was holding a rope between three lonely-looking hooks (Mr Tall had snapped the other hooks off before he died). When he tugged on the rope, a bound woman shuffled out after him ¨C Debbie.\n I\u0027d been expecting this, so I didn\u0027t panic. R.V. walked Debbie forwards a few paces, but stopped a long way short of Steve. The one-time campaigner for peace and the protection of mother nature didn\u0027t look very happy. He was twitchy, head jerking, eyes unfocused, nervously chewing at his lower lip, which was bleeding from where he\u0027d bitten through the flesh. R.V. had been a proud, earnest, dedicated man when I first met him, fighting to save the world from pollution. Then he\u0027d become a mad beast, intent only on gaining revenge for the loss of his hands. Now he was neither ¨C just a ragged, sorry mess.\n Steve didn\u0027t notice R.V.\u0027s confusion. He had eyes only for Debbie. \"Isn\u0027t she beautiful?\" he mocked me. \"Like an angel. More warrior-like than the last time we met, but all the lovelier because of it.\" He looked at me slyly. \"Be a shame if I had to tell R.V. to gut her like a rabid dog.\"\n \"You can\u0027t use her against me,\" I said softly, gazing at Steve without blinking. \"She knows who you are and what\u0027s at stake. I love her, but my first duty is to my clan. She understands that.\"\n \"You mean you\u0027ll stand there and let her die?\" Steve shrieked.\n \"Yes!\" Debbie shouted before I could reply.\n \"You people,\" Steve groaned. \"You\u0027re determined to annoy me. I try to be fair, but you toss it back in my face and...\" He hopped off of Pasta O\u0027Malley\u0027s back and ranted and raved, striding up and down behind his guards. I kept a close watch on him. If he stepped out too far, I\u0027d strike. But even in his rage he was careful not to expose himself.\n All of a sudden Steve stopped. \"So be it!\" he snarled. \"R.V. ¨C kill her!\"\n R.V. didn\u0027t respond. He was gazing miserably down at the ground.\n \"R.V.!\" Steve shouted. \"Didn\u0027t you hear me? Kill her!\"\n \"Don\u0027t want to,\" R.V. mumbled. His eyes came up and I saw pain and doubt in them. \"You shouldn\u0027t have killed the kid, Steve. He did nothing to hurt us. It was wrong. Kids are the future, man.\"\n \"I did what I had to,\" Steve replied tightly. \"Now you\u0027ll do the same.\"\n \"But she\u0027s not a vampire...\"\n \"She works for them!\" Steve shouted.\n \"I know,\" R.V. moaned. \"But why do we have to kill her? Why did you kill the kid? It was Darren we were meant to kill. He\u0027s the enemy, man. He\u0027s the one who cost me my hands.\"\n \"Don\u0027t betray me now,\" Steve growled, stepping towards the bearded vampaneze. \"You\u0027ve killed people too, the innocent as well as the guilty. Don\u0027t get moralistic on me. It doesn\u0027t become you.\"\n \"But...but... but...\"\n \"Stop stuttering and kill her!\" Steve screamed. He took another step forward and moved clear of his guards without being aware of it. I steeled myself to make a dash at him, but Vancha was one move ahead of me.\n \"Now !\" Vancha roared, leaping forward, drawing a shuriken and launching it at Steve. He would have killed him, except the guard at the end of the line saw the danger just in time and threw himself into the path of the deadly throwing star, sacrificing himself to save his Lord.\n As the other guards surged sideways to block Vancha\u0027s path to their Lord, I sheathed my knives, drew the pistol I\u0027d borrowed from Alice before entering the stadium, aimed it at the sky and pulled the trigger three times ¨C the signal for all-out riot! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-9.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
