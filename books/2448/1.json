{"id":79792,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"If my life was a fairy tale and I was writing a book about it, I\u0027d start with, \"Once upon a time there were two boys called Darren and Steve...\" But my life\u0027s a horror story, so if I were to write about it, I\u0027d have to begin with something like this instead:\\n\\n Evil has a name - Steve Leopard.\\n\\n He was born Steve Leonard, but to his friends (yes - he had friends once!) he was always Steve Leopard. He was never happy at home, didn\u0027t have a dad, didn\u0027t like his mum. He dreamt of power and glory. He yearned for strength and respect, and time in which to enjoy it. He wanted to be a vampire.\\n\\n His chance came when he spotted a creature of the night, Larten Crepsley, performing in the wondrous magical show, the Cirque Du Freak. He asked Mr Crepsley to blood him. The vampire refused - he said Steve had bad blood. Steve hated him for that and vowed to track him down and kill him when he grew up.\\n\\n Some years later, as Steve was preparing for his life as a vampire hunter, he learnt about the purple-skinned, red-eyed vampaneze. In legends, vampires are wicked killers who suck humans dry.\\n\\n Steve went in search of the vampaneze, certain they\u0027d accept him. He probably thought they were as twisted as he was. But he got it wrong. Although the vampaneze were killers, they weren\u0027t inherently evil. They didn\u0027t torture humans and they tried not to interfere with vampires. They went about their business quietly and calmly, keeping a lower-than-low profile.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know this for sure, but I\u0027m guessing the vampaneze rejected Steve, just like Mr Crepsley did. The vampaneze live by even stricter, more traditional rules than vampires. I can\u0027t see them accepting a human into their ranks if they knew he was going to turn out bad.\\n\\n But Steve found a way in, thanks to that eternal agent of chaos - Desmond Tiny. Most just call him Mr Tiny, but if you shorten his first name and put it with his surname, you get MrDestiny . He\u0027s the most powerful person in the world, immortal as far as anyone knows, a meddler of the highest order. He gave the vampaneze a present many centuries earlier, a coffin which filled with fire whenever a person lay within it, burning them to ash within seconds. But he said that one night someone would lie in the coffin and emerge unharmed. That person would be the Lord of the Vampaneze and had to be obeyed by every member of the clan. If they accepted this Lord, they\u0027d gain more power than they\u0027d ever imagined. Otherwise they\u0027d be destroyed.\\n\\n The promise of such power proved too much for Steve to ignore. He decided to take the test. He probably figured he had nothing to lose. He entered the coffin, the flames engulfed him, and a minute later he stepped out unburnt. Suddenly, everything changed. He had an army of vampaneze at his command, willing to give their lives for him and do anything he asked. He no longer had to settle for killing Mr Crepsley - he could wipe out the entire vampire clan!\\n\\n But Mr Tiny didn\u0027t want the vampaneze to crush the vampires too easily. He thrives on suffering and conflict. A quick, assured victory wouldn\u0027t provide him with enough entertainment. So he gave the vampires a get-out clause. Three of them had the ability to kill the Vampaneze Lord before he came fully into his powers. They\u0027d have four chances. If they were successful and killed him, the vampires would win the War of the Scars (that\u0027s what the battle between the vampires and vampaneze was known as). If they failed, two would die during the hunt, while the third would survive to witness the downfall of the clan.\\n\\n Mr Crepsley was one of the hunters. A Vampire Prince, Vancha March, was another. The last was also a Prince, the youngest ever, a half-vampire called Darren Shan - and that\u0027s whereI come in.\\n\\n I was Steve\u0027s best friend when we were kids. We went to the Cirque Du Freak together, and through Steve I learnt of the existence of vampires and was sucked into their world. I was blooded by Mr Crepsley and served as his assistant. Under his guidance I studied the ways of vampires and travelled to Vampire Mountain. There I undertook my Trials of Initiation - and failed. Fearing death, I fled, but during my escape I uncovered a plot to destroy the clan. Later I exposed it, and as a reward I was not only accepted into the fold, but made a Vampire Prince.\\n\\n After six years in Vampire Mountain, Mr Tinyset me on the trail of the Lord of the Vampaneze, along with Mr Crepsley and Vancha. One of Mr Tiny\u0027s Little People travelled with us. His name was Harkat Mulds. Little People are grey-skinned, stitched-together, short, with large green eyes, no nose, and ears sewn beneath the flesh of their heads. They\u0027re created from the remains of dead people. Harkat didn\u0027t know who he used to be, but we later found out he was Kurda Smahlt in his previous life - the vampire who\u0027d betrayed the clan in the hope of preventing the War of the Scars.\\n\\n Not knowing who the Vampaneze Lord was, we missed our first chance to kill him when Vancha let him escape, because he was under the protection of Vancha\u0027s vampaneze brother, Gannen Harst. Later, in the city of Mr Crepsley\u0027s youth, I ran into Steve again. He told me he was a vampaneze hunter and, fool that I was, I believed him. The others did too, although Mr Crepsley was suspicious. He sensed something wrong, but I convinced him to grant Steve the benefit of the doubt. I\u0027ve made some terrible mistakes in my life, but that was certainly the worst.\\n\\n When Steve revealed his true colours, we fought, and twice we had the power to kill him. The first time we let him live because we wanted to trade his life for Debbie Hemlock\u0027s - my human girlfriend. The second time, Mr Crepsley fought Steve, Gannen Harst and an impostor, who was pretending to be the Lord of the Vampaneze. Mr Crepsley killed the impostor, but then was knocked into a pit of stakes by Steve. He could have taken Steve down with him, but let him live so that Gannen and the other vampaneze would spare the lives of his friends. It was only afterwards that Steve revealed the truth about himself, and made the bitter loss of Mr Crepsley all the more unbearable.\\n\\n There was a long gap between that and our next encounter. I went with Harkat to find out the truth about his past, to a waste world full of monsters and mutants, which we later discovered was Earth in the future. Upon my return I spent a couple of years travelling with the Cirque Du Freak, waiting for destiny (or Des Tiny) to pit Steve and me together again for one final clash.\\n\\n Our paths finally crossed in our old home town. I\u0027d returned with the Cirque Du Freak. It was strange revisiting the past, walking the streets of the town where I\u0027d grown up. I saw my sister Annie, now a grown woman with a child of her own, and I ran into an old friend, Tommy Jones, who\u0027d become a professional footballer. I went to watch Tommy play in an important cup game. His team won, but their celebrations were cut short when two of Steve\u0027s henchmen invaded the pitch and killed a lot of people, including Tommy.\\n\\n I chased after the murderous pair, straight into a trap. I faced Steve again. He had a child called Darius with him - his son. Darius shot me. Steve could have finished me off, but didn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t the destined time. My end (or his) would only come when I faced him with Vancha by my side.\\n\\n Crawling through the streets, I was rescued by a pair of tramps. They\u0027d been recruited by Debbie and an ex-police inspector, Alice Burgess, who were building a human army to help the vampires. Vancha March linked up with me while I was recovering. With the ladies and Harkat, we returned to the Cirque Du Freak. We discussed the future with Mr Tall, the owner of the circus. He told us that no matter who won the war, an evil dictator known as the Lord of the Shadows would rise to rule and destroy the world.\\n\\n As we were trying to come to terms with the shocking news, two of Steve\u0027s crazed followers struck -\\n\\n R.V. and Morgan James, the pair who\u0027d killed Tommy. With the help of Darius, they slaughtered Mr Tall and took a hostage - a young boy called Shancus. Half human, half snake, he was the son of one of my best friends, Evra Von.\\n\\n As Mr Tall lay dying, Mr Tiny and a witch called Evanna mysteriously appeared out of nowhere. It turned out that Mr Tiny was Mr Tall\u0027s father, and Evanna his sister. Mr Tiny stayed to mourn the death of his son, while Evanna followed us as we chased after her brother\u0027s killers. We managed to kill Morgan James and capture Darius. As the others hurried after R.V. and Shancus, I stole a few words with Evanna. The witch had the ability to see into the future and she revealed that if I killed Steve, I would take his place as the dreaded Lord of the Shadows. I\u0027d become a monster, murder Vancha and anybody else who got in my way, and destroy not just the vampaneze, but humanity as well.\\n\\n As shocked as I was, there was no time to brood. With my allies, we tracked R.V. to the old cinema where Steve and I had first met Mr Crepsley. Steve was waiting for us, safe on the stage, separated from us by a pit which he\u0027d had dug and filled with stakes. He mocked us for a while, then agreed to trade Shancus\u0027s life for Darius\u0027s. But he lied. Instead of releasing the snake-boy, he killed him brutally. I still had hold of Darius. In a blind, cold rage, I prepared to murder him for revenge. But just before I stabbed the boy, Steve stopped me with his cruellest revelation yet - Darius\u0027s mother was my sister, Annie. If I murdered Steve\u0027s son, I\u0027d be killing my own nephew.\\n\\n And with that he departed, cackling like the demon he was, leaving me to the madness of the blood-drenched night.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-1.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \\n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
