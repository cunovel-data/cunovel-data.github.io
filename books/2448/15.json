{"id":79806,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Timelessness. Eternal gloom. Drifting in slow, never-ending circles. Surrounded but alone. Aware of other souls, trapped like me, but unable to contact them. No sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch. Only the crushing boredom of the present and painful memories of the past.\\n\\n I know this place. It\u0027s the Lake of Souls, a zone where spirits go when they can\u0027t leave Earth\u0027s pull. Some people\u0027s souls don\u0027t move on when they die. They remain trapped in the waters of this putrid lake, condemned to swirl silently in the depths for all eternity.\\n\\n I\u0027m sad I ended up here, but not surprised. I tried to live a good life, and I sacrificed myself at the end in an effort to save others, so in those respects I was maybe deserving of Paradise. But I was also a killer. Whatever my reasons, I took lives and created unhappiness. I don\u0027t know if some higher power has passed judgement on me, or if I\u0027m imprisoned by my own guilt. It doesn\u0027t really matter, I guess. I\u0027m here and there\u0027s no getting out. This is my lot. For ever.\\n\\n No sense of time. No days, nights, hours, minutes ¨C not even seconds. Have I been here a week, a year, a century? Can\u0027t tell. Does the War of the Scars still rage? Have the vampires or vampaneze fallen? Has another taken my place as the Lord of the Shadows? Did I die for no reason? I don\u0027t know. I probably never will. That\u0027s part of my sentence. Part of my curse.\\n\\n If the souls of the dead could speak, they\u0027d scream for release. Not just release from the Lake, but from their memories. Memories gnaw away at me relentlessly. I remember so much of my past, all the times where I failed or could have done better. With nothing else to do, I\u0027m forced to review my life, over and over. Even my most minor errors become supreme lapses of judgement. They torment me worse than Steve ever did.\\n\\n I try to hide from the pain of the memories by retreating further into my past. I remember the young Darren Shan, human, happy, normal, innocent. I spend years, decades ¨C or is it just minutes? ¨C reliving the simple, carefree times. I piece together my entire early life. I recall even the smallest details ¨C the colours of toy cars, homework assignments, throwaway conversations. I go through everyday chat a hundred times, until every word is correct. The longer I think about it, the deeper into those years I sink, losing myself, human again, almost able to believe that the memories are reality, and my death and the Lake of Souls nothing but an unpleasant dream.\\n\\n But eternity can\u0027t be dodged for ever. My later memories are always hovering, picking away at the boundaries of the limited reality which I\u0027ve built. Every so often I flash ahead to a face or event. Then I lose control and find myself thrust into the darker, nightmarish world of my life as a half-vampire. I relive the mistakes, the wrong choices, the bloodshed.\\n\\n So many friends lost, so many enemies killed. I feel responsible for all of them. I believed in peace when I first went to Vampire Mountain. Even though Kurda Smahlt betrayed his people, I felt sorry for him. I knew he did it in an effort to avoid war. I couldn\u0027t understand why it had come to this. If only the vampires and vampaneze had sat down and talked through their differences, war could have been avoided.\\n\\n When I first became a Prince, I dreamt of being a peace-monger, taking up where Kurda left off, bringing the vampaneze back into the clan. I lost those dreams somewhere during the six years I spent living within Vampire Mountain. Surviving as a vampire, learning their ways, training with weapons, sending friends out to fight and die... It all rubbed off on me, and when I finally returned to the world beyond the mountain, I\u0027d changed. I was a warrior, fierce, unmoved by death, intent on killing rather than talking.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t evil. Sometimes it\u0027s necessary to fight. There are occasions when you have to cast aside your nobler ideals and get your hands dirty. But you should always strive for peace, and search to find the peaceful solution to even the most bloody of conflicts. I didn\u0027t do that. I embraced the war and went along with the general opinion ¨C that if we killed the Vampaneze Lord, all our problems would be solved and life would be hunky-dory.\\n\\n We were wrong. The death of one man never solved anything. Steve was just the start. Once you set off down the road of murder, it\u0027s hard to take a detour. We couldn\u0027t have stopped. The death of one foe wouldn\u0027t have been enough. We\u0027d have set about annihilating the vampaneze after Steve, then humanity. We\u0027d have established ourselves as the rulers of the world, crushing all in our path, and I\u0027d have gone along with it. No, more than that ¨C I\u0027d have led, not just followed.\\n\\n That guilt, not just of what I\u0027ve done but of what I would have done, eats away at me like a million ravenous rats. It doesn\u0027t matter that I\u0027m the son of Desmond Tiny, that wickedness was in my genes. I had the power to break away from the dark designs of my father. I proved that at the end, by letting myself die. But why didn\u0027t I do it sooner, before so many people were killed?\\n\\n I don\u0027t know if I could have stopped the war, but I could have said, \"No, I don\u0027t want any part of this.\" I could have argued for peace, not fought for it. If I\u0027d failed, at least I maybe wouldn\u0027t have wound up here, weighed down by the chains of so many grisly deaths.\\n\\n Time passes. Faces swim in and out of my thoughts. Memories form, are forgotten, form again. I blank out large parts of my life, recover them, blank them out again. I succumb to madness and forget who I was. But the madness doesn\u0027t last. I reluctantly return to my senses.\\n\\n I think about my friends a lot, especially those who were alive when I died. Did any of them perish in the stadium? If they survived that, what came next? Since Steve and I both died, what happened with the War of the Scars? Could Mr Tiny replace us with new leaders, men with the same powers as Steve and me? Hard to see how, unless he fathered another couple of children.\\n\\n Was Harkat alive now, pushing for peace between the vampires and vampaneze, like he had when he was Kurda Smahlt? Had Alice Burgess led her vampirites against the vampets and crushed them? Did Debbie mourn for me? Not knowing was an agony. I\u0027d have sold my soul to the Devil for a few minutes in the world of the living, where I could find answers to my questions. But not even the Devil disturbed the waters of the Lake of Souls. This was the exclusive resting place of the dead and the damned.\\n\\n Drifting, ghostly, resigned. I fixate on my death, remembering Steve\u0027s face as he stabbed me, his hatred, his fear. I count the number of seconds it took me to die, the drops of blood I spilt on the riverbank where he killed me. I feel myself topple into the water of the river a dozen times... a hundred... a thousand.\\n\\n That water was so much more alive than the water of the Lake of Souls. Currents. Fish swam in it. Air bubbles. Cold. The water here is dead, as lifeless as the souls it contains. No fish explore its depths, no insects skim its surface. I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027m aware of these facts, but I am. I sense the awful emptiness of the Lake. It exists solely to hold the spirits of the miserable dead.\\n\\n I long for the river. I\u0027d meet any asking price if I could go back and experience the rush of flowing water again, the chill as I fell in, the pain as I bled to death. Anything\u0027s better than this limbo world. Even a minute of dying is preferable to an eternity of nothingness.\\n\\n One small measure of comfort ¨C as bad as this is for me, it must be much worse for Steve. My guilt is nothing compared to his. I was sucked into Mr Tiny\u0027s evil games, but Steve threw himself heart and soul into them. His crimes far outweigh mine, so his suffering must be that much more.\\n\\n Unless he doesn\u0027t accept his guilt. Perhaps eternity means nothing to him. Maybe he\u0027s just sore that I beat him. It could be that he doesn\u0027t worry about what he did, or realize just how much of a monster he was. He might be content here, reflecting with fondness on all that he achieved.\\n\\n But I doubt it. I suspect Mr Tiny\u0027s admission destroyed a large part of Steve\u0027s mad defences. Knowing that he was my brother, and that we were both puppets in our father\u0027s hands, must have shaken him up. I think, given the time to reflect ¨C and that\u0027s all one can do here ¨C he\u0027ll weep for what he did. He\u0027ll see himself for what he truly was, and hate himself for it.\\n\\n I shouldn\u0027t take pleasure in that. There, but for the grace of the gods... But I still despise Steve. I can understand why he acted that way, and I\u0027m sorry for him. But I can\u0027t forgive him. I can\u0027t stretch that far. Perhaps that\u0027s another reason why I\u0027m here.\\n\\n I\u0027m retreating from the painful memories again. Withdrawing from the vampire world, pretending it never happened. I imagine myself as a child, living the same days over and over, refusing to go beyond the afternoon when I won a ticket to the Cirque Du Freak. I build a perfect, sealed-off, comfortable reality. I\u0027m Darren Shan, loving son and brother, not the best behaved boy in the world, but far from the worst. I do chores for Mum and Dad, struggle with homework, watch TV, hang out with my friends. One moment I\u0027m six or seven years old, the next ten or eleven. Continually twisting back upon myself, living the past, ignoring all that I don\u0027t want to think about. Steve\u0027s my best friend. We read comics, watch horror movies, tell jokes to each other. Annie\u0027s a child, always a child ¨C I never think of her as a woman with a son of her own. Vampires are monsters of myth, like werewolves, zombies, mummies, not to be taken seriously.\\n\\n It\u0027s my aim to become the Darren of my memories, to lose myself completely in the past. I don\u0027t want to deal with the guilt any more. I\u0027ve gone mad before and recovered. I want to go mad again, but this time let madness swallow me whole.\\n\\n I struggle to vanish into the past. Remembering everything, painting the details more precisely every time I revisit a moment. I start to forget about the souls, the Lake, the vampires and vampaneze. I still get occasional flashes of reality, but I clamp down on them quickly. Thinking as a child, remembering as a child, becoming a child.\\n\\n I\u0027m almost there. The madness waits, arms spread wide, welcoming me. I\u0027ll be living a lie, but it will be a peaceful, soothing lie. I long for it. I work hard to make it real. And I\u0027m getting there. I feel myself sliding closer towards it. I reach for the lie with the tendrils of my mind. I feel around it, explore it, start to slip inside it, when all of a sudden ¨C a new sensation...\\n\\n Pain! Heaviness. Rising. The madness is left behind. The water of the Lake closes around me. Searing pain! Thrashing, coughing, gasping. But with what ? I have no arms to thrash, no mouth to cough, no lungs to gasp. Is this part of the madness? Am I...\\n\\n And suddenly my head - an actual, real head ! - breaks the surface. I\u0027m breathing air. Sunlight blinds me. I spit water out. My arms come clear of the Lake. I\u0027m surrounded, but not by the souls of the dead ¨C by nets! People pulling on them. Coming out of the Lake. Screaming with pain and confusion ¨C but no sounds. Body forming, incredibly heavy after all this weightless time. I land on hard, warm earth. My feet drag out of the water. Amazed, I try to stand. I make it to my knees, then fall. I hit the ground hard. Pain again, fresh and frightening. I curl up into a ball, shivering like a baby. I shut my eyes against the light and dig my fingers into the earth to reassure myself that it\u0027s real. And then I sob feebly as the incredible, bewildering, impossible realization sinks in ¨C I\u0027m alive ! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-15.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \\n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
