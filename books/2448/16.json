{"id":79807,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"The sun hammered down fiercely upon me but I couldn\u0027t stop shivering. Someone threw a blanket around me, hairy and thick. It itched like mad, but the sensation was delicious. Any sensation would have been welcome after the numbness of the Lake of Souls. The person who\u0027d draped the blanket over me knelt by my side and tilted my head back. I blinked water from my eyes and focused. It took a few seconds, but finally I fixed on my rescuer. It was a Little Person. At first I thought it was Harkat. I opened my mouth to shout his name happily. Then I did a double take and realized this wasn\u0027t my old friend, just one of his grey, scarred, green-eyed kind. The Little Person examined me silently, prodding and poking. Then he stood and stepped aside, leaving me. I wrapped the blanket tighter around myself, trying to stop the shivers. After a while I worked up the strength to look around. I was lying by the rim of the Lake of Souls. The earth around me was hard and dry, like desert. Several Little People stood nearby. A couple were hanging up nets to dry ¨C the nets they\u0027d fished me out with. The others simply stared off into space or at the Lake. There was a screeching sound high overhead. Looking up, I saw a huge winged beast circling the Lake. From my previous trip here, I knew it was a dragon. My insides clenched with fear. Then I noticed a second dragon. A third. A fourth. Jaw dropping, I realized the sky was full of them, dozens, maybe hundreds. If they caught sight of me... I started to scrabble weakly for safety, then paused and glanced at the Little People. They knew the dragons were there, but they weren\u0027t bothered by the giant flying reptiles. They might have dragged me out of the Lake to feed me to the dragons, but I didn\u0027t think so. And even if they had, in my feeble state I could do nothing about it. I couldn\u0027t flee or fight, and there was nowhere to hide. So I just lay where I was and waited for events to run their course. For several minutes the dragons circled and the Little People stood motionless. I was still filled with a great chill, but I wasn\u0027t shivering quite as much as when I first came out of the Lake. I was gathering what small amounts of energy I could call on, to try and walk over to the Little People and quiz them about what was going on, when somebody spoke behind me. \"Sorry I\u0027m late.\" I looked over my shoulder, expecting Mr Tiny, but it was his daughter, (my half-sister!) Evanna, striding towards me. She looked no different from how I remembered her, though there was a sparkle in her green and brown eyes which had been absent when last we met. \"Whuh!\" I croaked, the only sound I was able to make. \"Easy,\" Evanna said, reaching me and bending to squeeze my shoulder warmly. \"Don\u0027t try to speak. It will take a few hours for the effects of the Lake to wear off. I\u0027ll build a fire and cook some broth for you. That\u0027s why I wasn\u0027t here when you were fished out ¨C I was looking for firewood.\" She pointed to a mound of logs and branches. I wanted to besiege her with questions, but there was no point taxing my throat when it wasn\u0027t ready to work. So I said nothing as she picked me up and carried me to the pile of wood like a baby, then set me down and turned her attention to the kindling. When the fire was burning nicely, Evanna took a flat circular object out from beneath the ropes she was wearing. I recognized it immediately ¨C a collapsible pot, the same sort that Mr Crepsley had once used. She pressed it in the middle, causing it to pop outwards and assume its natural shape, then filled it with water (not from the Lake, but from a bucket) and some grass and herbs, and hung it from a stick over the flames. The broth was weak and tasteless, but its warmth was like the fire of the gods to me. I drank deeply, one bowl, another, a third. Evanna smiled as I slurped, then sipped slowly from a bowl of her own. The dragons screeched at regular intervals overhead, the sun burnt brightly, and the scent of the smoke was magical. I felt strangely relaxed, as if this was a lazy summer Sunday afternoon. I was halfway through my fourth bowl before my stomach growled at me to say, \"Enough!\" Sighing happily, I laid the bowl down and sat, smiling lightly, thinking only of the good feelings inside. But I couldn\u0027t sit silently for ever, so eventually I raised my gaze, looked at Evanna and tested my vocal chords. \"Urch,\" I creaked ¨C I\u0027d meant to say \"Thanks.\" \"It\u0027s been a long time since you spoke,\" Evanna said. \"Start simply. Try the alphabet. I will hunt for more wood, to sustain the fire. We won\u0027t be staying here much longer, but we may as well have warmth while we are. Practise while I am gone, and we can maybe talk when I return.\" I did as the witch advised. At first I struggled to produce sounds anything like they should be, but I stuck with it and gradually my As started to sound like As, my Bs like Bs, and so on. When I\u0027d run through the alphabet several times without making a mistake, I moved on to words, simple stuff to begin with ¨C cat, dog, Mum, Dad, sky, me. I tried names after that, longer words, and finally sentences. It hurt to speak, and I slurred some words, but when Evanna eventually came back, clutching an armful of pitiful twigs, I was able to greet her in a gravelly but semi-normal voice. \"Thanks for the broth.\" \"You\u0027re welcome.\" She threw some of the twigs on to the fire, then sat beside me. \"How do you feel?\" \"Rough as rust.\" \"Do you remember your name?\" I squinted at her oddly. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I?\" \"The Lake twists the minds of people,\" she said. \"It can destroy memories. Many of the souls forget who they are. They go mad and lose track of their pasts. You were in there a long time. I feared the worst.\" \"I came close,\" I admitted, hunching up closer to the fire, recalling my attempts to go mad and escape the weight of my memories. \"It was horrible. Easier to be crazy in there than sane.\" \"So what is it?\" Evanna asked. When I blinked dumbly, she laughed. \"Your name?\" \"Oh.\" I smiled. \"Darren. Darren Shan. I\u0027m a half-vampire. I remember it all, the War of the Scars, Mr Crepsley, Steve.\" My features darkened. \"I remember my death, and what Mr Tiny said just before it.\" \"Quite the one for surprises, isn\u0027t he ¨C our father?\" She looked at me sideways to see what I\u0027d say about that, but I couldn\u0027t think of anything ¨C how do you respond to the news that Des Tiny is your dad, and a centuries-old witch is your half-sister? To avoid the subject, I studied the land around me. \"This place looks different,\" I said. \"It was green when I came with Harkat, lots of grass and fresh earth.\" \"This is further into the future,\" Evanna explained. \"Before, you travelled a mere two hundred or so years ahead of the present. This time you have come hundreds of thousands of years, maybe more. I\u0027m not entirely certain. This is the first time our father has ever allowed me to come here.\" \"Hundreds of...\" My head spun. \"This is the age of dragons,\" Evanna said. \"The age after mankind.\" My breath caught in my throat, and I had to clear it twice before I could respond. \"You mean humanity has died out?\" \"Died out or moved on to other worlds or spheres.\" Evanna shrugged. \"I cannot say for sure. I know only that the world belongs to dragons now. They control it as humans once did, and dinosaurs before them.\" \"And the War of the Scars?\" I asked nervously. \"Who won that?\" Evanna was silent a moment. Then she said, \"We have much to speak about. Let\u0027s not rush.\" She pointed at the dragons high above us. \"Call one of them down.\" \"What?\" I frowned. \"Call them, the way you used to call Madam Octa. You can control dragons like you controlled your pet spider.\" \"How?\" I asked, bewildered. \"I will show you. But first ¨C call.\" She smiled. \"They will not harm us. You have my word.\" I wasn\u0027t too sure about that, but how cool would it be to control a dragon! Looking up, I studied the creatures in the sky, then fixed on one slightly smaller than the others. (I didn\u0027t want to bring a large one down, in case Evanna was wrong and it attacked.) I tracked it with my eyes for a few seconds, then stretched out a hand towards it and whispered, \"Come to me. Come down. Come, my beauty.\" The dragon executed a backwards somersault, then dropped swiftly. I thought it was going to blast us into a thousand pieces. I panicked and tried to run. Evanna hauled me back into place. \"Calmly,\" she said. \"You cannot control it if you break contact, and now that it knows we are here, it would be dangerous to let it have its own way.\" I didn\u0027t want to play this game, but it was too late to back out now. With my heart beating fiercely, I fixed on the swooping dragon and spoke to it again. \"Easy. Pull up. I don\u0027t want to hurt you ¨C and I don\u0027t want you to hurt us! Just hover above us a bit and...\" The dragon pulled out of its fall and came to a halt several metres overhead. It flapped its leathery wings powerfully. I could hear nothing over the sound, and the force of the air knocked me backwards. As I struggled to right myself, the dragon came to land close beside me. It tucked its wings in, thrust its head down as though it meant to gobble me up, then stopped and just stared. The beast was much like those I\u0027d seen before. Its wings were a light green colour, it was about six metres long, scaled like a snake, with a bulging chest and thin tail. The scales on its stomach were a dull red and gold colour, while those on top were green with red flecks. It had two long forelegs near the front of its body, and two small hindlegs about a quarter of the way from the rear. Lots of sharp claws. A head like an alligator, long and flat, with bulging yellow eyes and small pointed ears. Its face was dark purple. It also had a long forked tongue and, if it was like the other dragons, it could blow fire. \"It\u0027s incredible,\" Evanna said. \"This is the first time I have seen one up so close. Our father excelled himself with this creation.\" \"Mr Tiny made the dragons?\" Evanna nodded. \"He helped human scientists create them. Actually, one of your friends was a key member of the team ¨C Alan Morris. With our father\u0027s aid he made a breakthrough which allowed them to be cloned from a combination of dinosaur cells.\" \"Alan ?\" I snorted. \"You\u0027re telling me Alan Morris made dragons? That\u0027s total and utter...\" I stopped short. Tommy had told me Alan was a scientist, and that he\u0027d specialized in cloning. It was hard to believe the foolish boy I\u0027d known had grown up to become a creator of dinosaurs ¨C but then again, it was hard to believe Steve had become the Vampaneze Lord, or myself a Vampire Prince. I suppose all influential men and women must start out as normal, unremarkable children. \"For many centuries, the rulers of this world will keep the dragons in check,\" Evanna said. \"They\u0027ll control them. Later, when they lose their hold on power ¨C as all rulers must ¨C the dragons will fly free and multiply, becoming a real menace. In the end they\u0027ll outlive or outlast all the humans, vampires and vampaneze, and rule the world in their turn. I\u0027m not sure what comes after them. I\u0027ve never looked that far ahead.\" \"Why doesn\u0027t it kill us?\" I asked, eyeing the dragon uneasily. \"Is it tame?\" \"Hardly!\" Evanna laughed. \"Normally the dragons would tear us apart. Our father masks this area from them ¨C they can\u0027t see the Lake of Souls or anyone around it.\" \"This one sees us,\" I noted. \"Yes, but you\u0027re controlling it, so we are safe.\" \"The last time I was here, I was almost roasted alive by dragons,\" I said. \"How can I control them now when I couldn\u0027t before?\" \"But you could,\" Evanna replied. \"You had the power ¨C you just didn\u0027t know it. The dragons would have obeyed you then, as they do now.\" \"Why?\" I frowned. \"What\u0027s so special about me?\" \"You\u0027re Desmond Tiny\u0027s son,\" Evanna reminded me. \"Even though he did not pass on his magical powers to you, traces of his influence remain. That is why you were skilled at controlling animals such as spiders and wolves. But there is more to it than that.\" Evanna reached out, her hand extending far beyond its natural length, and touched the dragon\u0027s head. Its skull glowed beneath the witch\u0027s touch. Its purple skin faded, then became translucent, so I could see inside to its brain. The oval, stone-like shape was instantly familiar, though it took me a few seconds to recall what it reminded me of. Then it clicked. \"The Stone of Blood!\" I exclaimed. While this was much smaller than the one in the Hall of Princes, it was unmistakably the same type. The Stone of Blood had been a gift to the vampires from Mr Tiny. For seven hundred years the members of the clan had fed their blood to it, and used it to keep track of and communicate with each other. It was an invaluable tool, but dangerous ¨C if it had fallen into the hands of the vampaneze, they could have tracked down and killed almost every living vampire. \"Our father took the brain of a dragon into the past and gave it to the vampires,\" Evanna said. \"He often does that ¨C travels into the past and makes small changes which influence the present and future. Through the Stone of Blood he bound the vampires more tightly to his will. If the vampires win the War of the Scars, they will use the Stone to control the dragons, and through them the skies. I don\u0027t think the vampaneze will use it if they win... They never trusted this gift of Desmond Tiny\u0027s ¨C it was one of the reasons they broke away from the rest of the vampire clan. I\u0027m not sure what their relationship with the dragons would be like. Perhaps our father will provide them with some other way of controlling the beasts ¨C or maybe it will please him to let them be enemies.\" \"The Stone of Blood was supposed to be the clan\u0027s last hope,\" I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the dragon\u0027s glowing brain. \"There was a legend ¨C if we lost the war with the vampaneze, the Stone of Blood might some night help us rise again.\" Evanna nodded and removed her hand from the dragon\u0027s head. It stopped glowing and resumed its normal appearance. The dragon didn\u0027t seem to have noticed any change. It continued staring at me, awaiting my command. \"Above all else, our father craves chaos,\" Evanna said. \"Stability bores him. He has no interest in seeing any race rule for ever. For a time it pleased him to let humans rule this planet, since they were violent, always at war with one another. But when he saw them heading the way of peace during the latter half of the twentieth century ¨C or thought he did; to be honest, I don\u0027t agree with his assessment ¨C he set about overthrowing them. He will do the same with their successors. \"If the vampaneze win the War of the Scars and wipe out the vampires, he\u0027ll use the Stone in the future. He will lead humans to it and teach them to extract the blood cells and build a new army of cloned vampires. But they won\u0027t be vampires as you know them. Desmond will control the cloning process and meddle with the cells, twisting and re-shaping them. The new creatures will be more savage than the original vampires, with less developed brains, slaves to the whim of our father.\" Evanna smiled twistedly. \"So yes, our father told the truth when he said the Stone of Blood could help the vampires rise again ¨C but he kept a few of the less savoury facts to himself.\" \"Then neither side can truly win,\" I said. \"He\u0027s just setting the victors up for a later fall.\" \"That has always been Desmond\u0027s way,\" Evanna said. \"What he helps create, he later destroys. Many empires ¨C Egyptian, Persian, British ¨C have already learnt that to their cost.\" \"Egyptian?\" I blinked. \"Our father is a great fan of empires,\" Evanna said. \"Cavemen hitting each other with sticks and bones were of very limited interest to him. He prefers to see people killing each other with more effective weapons, and in greater numbers. But for mankind to advance barbarically, it also had to advance in other ways. It had to grow socially, culturally, spiritually, technologically, medically. Only a nation which was great in all aspects could wage war greatly. \"Our father has had his hand in most of the notable architectural, technical or medical breakthroughs of mankind. He could never openly lead, but he influenced slyly. The only area where he had no real power was that of literature. Desmond is not a fictional dreamer. Reality is everything to him. He has no interest in the wonderful stories of mankind. Writers have always been alien to him ¨C he does not read works of fiction, or take any notice of them.\" \"Never mind that,\" I grunted, not giving a hoot about Mr Tiny\u0027s choice of reading material. \"Tell me more about his meddling with mankind, and time-travelling. You say Mr Tiny goes into the past to change the present and future. But what about the time paradox?\" I\u0027d seen lots of science fiction movies and TV shows. I knew all about the problems associated with the theory of time travel. \"There is no paradox,\" Evanna said. \"The universe keeps natural order. The key events of the past cannot be changed ¨C only the people involved.\" \"Huh?\" I said. \"Once something important happens in the present ¨C the universe, to give the higher force a name, decides what is important or not ¨C it can never be changed,\" Evanna explained. \"But you can alter the people involved. For instance, now that it has happened, you cannot travel to the past and prevent World War Two ¨C but you could go back and kill Adolf Hitler. The universe would immediately create another person to fill his shoes. That person would be born like any normal person, grow up, then do what Hitler did, with precisely the same results. The name would change, but nothing else.\" \"But Hitler was a monster,\" I said. \"He murdered millions of people. Do you mean, if Mr Tiny went back and killed him, some innocent guy would take his place? All those people would still die?\" \"Yes,\" Evanna said. \"But then that person wouldn\u0027t have chosen their fate,\" I frowned. \"They wouldn\u0027t be responsible for their actions.\" Evanna sniffed. \"The universe would have to create a child with the potential for wickedness ¨C a good man cannot be forced to do evil ¨C but once it did, yes, that person would become a victim of destiny. It does not happen often. Our father only occasionally replaces important figures of the past. Most people have free will. But there are a few who don\u0027t.\" \"Am I one of them?\" I asked quietly, fearing the answer. \"Most definitely not,\" Evanna smiled. \"Your time is the present time, and you are an original creation. Though you were manipulated by our father since birth, the path you trod had not been laid down by anyone before you.\" Evanna thought for a few seconds, then tried to explain the situation in a way which I could more easily understand. \"Although our father cannot change the events of the past, he can make minor alterations,\" she said. \"If something happens in the present which is not to his liking, he can return to the past and create a train of events designed to lead to a solution to whatever is troubling him. That\u0027s how vampires came to be so numerous and powerful.\" \"Mr Tiny created vampires?\" I shouted ¨C there was a myth that he\u0027d made us, but I\u0027d never believed it. \"No,\" Evanna said. \"Vampires came into being by themselves. But there were never many of them. They were weak and disorganized. Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, our father decided mankind was taking a path towards peace and unity. Disliking it, he travelled to the past and spent a couple of decades trying different approaches to undermine humanity. In the end he settled on vampires. He gave them extra strength and speed, the power to flit and share their thoughts ¨C all the supernatural abilities which you know about. He also provided them with leaders who would knock them into shape and turn them into an army. \"As powerful as the clan became, our father ensured they couldn\u0027t be a threat to humans. Originally vampires were able to come out by day ¨C Desmond Tiny made them prisoners of the night, and robbed them of the gift of childbirth. Carefully shackled and maintained this way, the vampires had to live separately to the world of man and remain in the shadows. Since they didn\u0027t change anything important in the human history, the universe let them exist, and they eventually become part of the present ¨C which is when our father was free to use them however he wished.\" \"And the present was my time?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" Evanna said. \"Time passes at the same rate, whether our father is in the past, present or future. So, since he spent almost twenty years stuck in the past, trying to find a way to topple humanity, it was late in the twentieth century when he returned to the present.\" \"And because vampires were now part of that present,\" I said, my brain hurting as I tried to keep up with all this mind-boggling information, \"they were free to influence the future?\" \"Correct,\" Evanna said. \"But our father then saw that the clan wouldn\u0027t launch an attack on humanity if left to their own devices ¨C they were content to stay out of the affairs of men. So he went back again ¨C just for a few months this time ¨C and engineered the vampaneze breakaway. By then planting the legend of the Lord of the Vampaneze, he edged them towards conflict with the vampires.\" \"And that led to the War of the Scars, and eventually the downfall of humanity,\" I growled, sick at the thought of the little man\u0027s terrible slyness. \"Well,\" Evanna smiled, \"that was the plan.\" \"Do you mean-\" I began to say excitedly, sensing hope in her smile. \"Hush,\" Evanna stopped me. \"I will reveal all shortly. But now it is time for us to move on.\" She pointed to where the sun was setting on the horizon. \"The nights are colder in this time than in yours. We will be safer underground. Besides,\" she said, rising, \"we have an appointment to keep.\" \"With who?\" I asked. She looked at me steadily. \"Our father.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-16.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
