{"id":79809,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"About an hour later the tunnel ended and we entered the home of Desmond Tiny. I\u0027d never really thought of him having a home. I just assumed he wandered the world, always on the move, in search of bloodshed and chaos. But, now that I considered it, I realized every monster needs a den to call its own, and Mr Tiny\u0027s had to be the strangest of them all.\\n\\n It was a huge ¨C and I mean HUGE ¨C cave, maybe a couple of miles or so wide, and stretching as far ahead as I could make out. Much of the cave was natural, stalagmites and stalactites, waterfalls, beautifully weird rock colours and formations. But much more of it was incredibly un natural.\\n\\n There were grand old cars from what I guessed must be the 1920s or 1930s floating in the air overhead. At first I thought they were attached to the ceiling by wires, but they were in constant motion, circling, crossing paths, even looping around like planes, and not a wire in sight.\\n\\n There were mannequins all over the place, dressed in costumes from every century and continent, from a primitive loincloth to the most outrageous modern fashion accessories. Their blank eyes unsettled me ¨C I got the feeling that they were watching me, ready to spring to life at Mr Tiny\u0027s command and leap upon me.\\n\\n There were works of art and sculpture, some so famous that even an art cretin like me recognized them ¨C the Mona Lisa, The Thinker, The Last Supper . Mixed in with them, displayed like art exhibits, were dozens of brains preserved in glass cases. I read a few of the labels ¨C Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner, Mahler. (That one gave me a jump ¨C I\u0027d gone to a school named after Mahler!)\\n\\n \"Our father loves music,\" Evanna whispered. \"Where humans collect sheet music or gramophone records-\" She obviously hadn\u0027t heard about CDs yet! \" -he collects brains of composers. By touching them, he can listen to all the tunes they ever composed, along with many they never completed or shared with the world.\"\\n\\n \"But where does he get them from?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"He travels to the past when they have just died and robs their graves,\" she said, as though it was the most casual thing in the world. I thought about questioning the right and wrong of something like that, but there were weightier issues to deal with, so I let it slide.\\n\\n \"He likes art too, I take it,\" I said, nodding at a flowery Van Gogh.\\n\\n \"Immensely,\" Evanna said. \"These are all originals of course ¨C he doesn\u0027t bother with copies.\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense!\" I snorted. \"These can\u0027t be real. I\u0027ve seen some of the real paintings. Mum and Dad-\" I still thought of my human Dad as my real father, and always would. \" -took me to see the Mona Lisa in the Loo once.\"\\n\\n \"The Louvre,\" Evanna corrected me. \"That is a copy. Some of our father\u0027s Little People are created from the souls of artists. They make perfect copies of pieces he especially admires. Then he slips back to the past and swaps the copy for the original. In most cases even the actual artist cannot tell the difference.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re telling me the Mona Lisa in Paris is a fake?\" I asked sceptically.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Evanna laughed at my expression. \"Our father is a selfish man. He always keeps the best for himself. What he wants, he takes ¨C and he normally wants the best of everything. Except books.\" Her voice became pointed, as it had earlier when she\u0027d been talking about his attitude towards books. \"Desmond never reads works of fiction. He doesn\u0027t collect books or pay any attention to authors. Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Tolstoy, Twain ¨C all have passed him by unmarked. He doesn\u0027t care what they have to say. He has nothing to do with the world of literature. It\u0027s as if it exists in a separate universe from his.\"\\n\\n Once again I didn\u0027t see her point in telling me this, so I let my interest wander. I\u0027d never been a big art fan, but even I was impressed by this display. It was the ultimate collection, capturing a slice of pretty much all the artistic wonder and imagination mankind had ever conjured into being.\\n\\n There was far too much for any one person to take in. Weapons, jewellery, toys, tools, albums of stamps, bottles of vintage wine, Faberg¨¦ eggs, grandfather clocks, suites of furniture, thrones of kings and queens. A lot of it was precious, but there were plenty of worthless items too, stuff which had simply caught Mr Tiny\u0027s fancy, such as bottle tops, oddly shaped balloons, digital watches, a collection of empty ice-cream tubs, thousands of whistles, hundreds of thousands of coins (old ones mixed in with brand new ones), and so on. The treasure cave in Aladdin seemed like a bargain bin in comparison.\\n\\n Even though the cave was packed with all manner of wonders and oddities, it didn\u0027t feel cluttered. There was plenty of space to walk about and explore. We wound our way through the various collections and artefacts, Evanna pausing occasionally to point out a particularly interesting piece ¨C the charred stake on which Joan Of Arc was burnt, the pistol which had been used to shoot Lincoln, the very first wheel.\\n\\n \"Historians would go crazy in this place,\" I noted. \"Does Mr Tiny ever bring anybody here?\"\\n\\n \"Almost never,\" Evanna said. \"This is his private sanctuary. I\u0027ve only been here a handful of times myself. The exceptions are those he pulls out of the Lake of Souls. He has to bring them here to turn them into Little People.\"\\n\\n I stopped when she said that. I\u0027d had a sudden premonition. \"Evanna...\" I began, but she shook her head.\\n\\n \"Ask no more questions,\" she said. \"Desmond will explain the rest to you. It won\u0027t be long now.\"\\n\\n Minutes later we reached what felt like the centre of the cave. There was a small pool of green liquid, a pile of blue robes and, standing beside them, Mr Tiny. He was staring at me sourly through the lenses of his thick glasses.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" he drawled, hooking his thumbs behind his braces. \"If it isn\u0027t the young martyr himself. Meet anyone interesting in the Lake of Souls?\"\\n\\n \"Ignore him,\" Evanna said out of the side of her mouth.\\n\\n Mr Tiny waddled forward and stopped a few metres shy of me. His eyes seemed to dance with fire this close up. \"If I\u0027d known what a nuisance you were going to be, I\u0027d never have spawned you,\" he hissed.\\n\\n \"Too late now,\" I jeered.\\n\\n \"No it isn\u0027t,\" he said. \"I could go back and erase you from the past, make it so you never lived. The universe would replace you. Somebody else would become the youngest ever Vampire Prince, hunt for the Vampaneze Lord, etc. ¨C but you would never have existed. Your soul wouldn\u0027t just be destroyed ¨C it would be unmade completely.\"\\n\\n \"Father,\" Evanna said warningly, \"you know you aren\u0027t going to do that.\"\\n\\n \"But I could!\" Mr Tiny insisted.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she tutted, \"but you won\u0027t. We have an agreement. I\u0027ve upheld my end. Now it\u0027s your turn.\"\\n\\n Mr Tiny muttered something unpleasant, then forced a fake smile. \"Very well. I\u0027m a man of my word. Let\u0027s get on with it. Darren, my woebegotten boy, get rid of that blanket and hop into the pool.\" He nodded at the green liquid.\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked stiffly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s time to recast you.\"\\n\\n A few minutes earlier, I wouldn\u0027t have known what he was talking about. But Evanna\u0027s hint had prepared me for this. \"You want to turn me into a Little Person, don\u0027t you?\" I said.\\n\\n Mr Tiny\u0027s lips twitched. He glared at Evanna, but she shrugged innocently. \"A right little know-it-all, aren\u0027t you?\" he huffed, disgusted that I\u0027d ruined his big surprise.\\n\\n \"How does it work?\" I asked.\\n\\n Mr Tiny crossed to the pool and crouched beside it. \"This is the soup of creation,\" he said, running a finger through the thick green liquid. \"It will become your blood, the fuel on which your new body runs. Your bones will be stripped bare when you step in. Your flesh, brain, organs and soul will dissolve. I shall mix the lot up and build a new body out of the mess.\" He grinned. \"Those who\u0027ve been through it tell me it\u0027s a most frightfully painful procedure, the worst they\u0027ve ever known.\"\\n\\n \"What makes you think I\u0027m going to do it?\" I asked tightly. \"I\u0027ve seen how your Little People live, mindless, speechless, unable to remember their original identities, slaves to your whims, eating the flesh of dead animals ¨C even humans! Why should I place myself under your spell like that?\"\\n\\n \"No deal with my daughter if you don\u0027t,\" Mr Tiny said simply.\\n\\n I shook my head stubbornly. I knew Evanna was trying to out-fox Mr Tiny, but I didn\u0027t see why this was necessary. How could I help bring about peace between the vampires and vampaneze by going through a load of pain and becoming a Little Person? It didn\u0027t make sense.\\n\\n As if reading my thoughts, Evanna said softly, \"This is for you, Darren. It has nothing to do with what is happening in the present, or the War of the Scars. This is your only hope of escaping the pull of the Lake of Souls and going to Paradise. You can live a full life as you are, in this waste world, and return to the Lake when you die. Or you can trust us and place yourself in our fathers hands.\"\\n\\n \"I trust you,\" I said to Evanna, shooting an arch look at Mr Tiny.\\n\\n \"Oh, my boy, if you only knew how much that hurts,\" Mr Tiny said miserably, then laughed. \"Enough of the dawdling. You either do this or you don\u0027t. But take heed, daughter ¨C by making the offer, I\u0027ve fulfilled my end of the bargain. If the boy refuses to accept your advice, on his head be it. I\u0027ll expect you to keep your word.\"\\n\\n Evanna looked at me questioningly, not placing any pressure on me. I thought about it at length. I hated the idea of becoming a Little Person. It wasn\u0027t so much the pain as letting Mr Tiny become my master. And what if Evanna was lying? I\u0027d said I trusted the witch, but thinking back, I realized there was precious little reason to trust her. She\u0027d never betrayed her father before, or worked for the good of any inpidual. Why start now? What if this was a twisted scheme to ensnare me, and she was in league with Mr Tiny, or had been tricked into doing his bidding? The whole thing stank of a trap.\\n\\n But what other option had I? Give Evanna the cold shoulder, refuse to enter the pool, walk away? Even assuming Mr Tiny let me leave, and the monsters in the tunnel didn\u0027t catch me, what would I have to look forward to? A life lived in a world full of dragons, followed by eternity in the Lake of Souls, wasn\u0027t my idea of a good time! In the end I decided it was better to gamble and hope for the best.\\n\\n \"OK,\" I said reluctantly. \"But there\u0027s one condition.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re in no position to set conditions,\" Mr Tiny growled.\\n\\n \"Maybe not,\" I agreed, \"but I\u0027m setting one anyway. I\u0027ll only do it if you guarantee me a free memory. I don\u0027t want to wind up like Harkat, not knowing who I was, obeying your orders because I\u0027ve no free will of my own. I\u0027m not sure what you have planned for me once I become a Little Person, but if it involves serving as one of your fog-brained slaves...\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t,\" Mr Tiny interrupted. \"I admit I quite like the idea of having you toady to me for a few million years or so, but my daughter was very precise when it came to the terms of our agreement. You won\u0027t be able to talk but that\u0027s the only restriction.\"\\n\\n \"Why won\u0027t I be able to talk?\" I frowned.\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m sick of listening to you!\" Mr Tiny barked. \"Besides, you won\u0027t need to speak. Most of my Little People don\u0027t. Muteness hasn\u0027t harmed any of the others, and it won\u0027t harm you.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" I muttered. I didn\u0027t like it, but I could see there was no point arguing. Stepping up to the edge of the pool, I shrugged off the blanket which the Little People had draped around me shortly after I emerged from the Lake of Souls. I stared into the dark green liquid. I couldn\u0027t see my reflection in it. \"What-\" I started to ask.\\n\\n \"No time for questions!\" Mr Tiny barked and nudged me hard with an elbow. I teetered on the edge of the pool a moment, arms flailing, then splashed heavily into what felt like the sizzling fires of hell. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-18.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \\n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
