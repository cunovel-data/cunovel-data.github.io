If he\u0027d lived, he\u0027d have had to carry around the memory of the evil he\u0027d committed while in league with the vampaneze. Maybe he was better off this way.\\n\\n \"And now there\u0027s two ¨C just me and you,\" Steve trilled, breaking my train of thought. I glanced up and saw him standing a few metres away from R.V., smiling. Gannen Harst was still out for the count, and although Vancha was alive, he was lying motionless, wheezing fitfully, unable to defend himself or attack.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I agreed, standing and picking up my sword. My left hand wouldn\u0027t work and my system was maybe a minute or two away from complete shutdown. But I\u0027d enough strength left for one last fight. First though ¨C Vancha. I paused over him and studied at his wound. It was seeping blood and his face was creased with pain. He tried to speak but words wouldn\u0027t form.\\n\\n As I hovered uncertainly by the side of my fellow Prince, unwilling to leave him like this, Evanna crossed to his side, knelt and examined him. Her eyes were grave when she looked up. \"It is not fatal,\" she said softly. \"He will live.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"Save your thanks,\" Mr Tiny said. He was standing directly behind me. \"She didn\u0027t tell you to cheer you up, silly boy. It was a warning. Vancha won\u0027t die for the time being, but he\u0027s out of the fight. You\u0027re alone. The final hunter. Unless you turn tail and run, it\u0027s down to you and Steve now. If Steve doesn\u0027t die, death will come within the next few minutes for you !\"\\n\\n I looked over my shoulder at the small man in the yellow suit and green Wellington boots. His face was bright with bloodthirsty glee. \"If death comes,\" I said shortly, \"it will be a far more welcome companion than you.\"\\n\\n Mr Tiny chuckled, then stepped away to my left. Rising, Evanna took up position on my right. Both waited for me to move, so that they could follow. I spared Vancha one final glance ¨C he grinned painfully at me and winked ¨C then faced Steve.\\n\\n He backed away from me casually, entering the shadows beneath the bridge. I trailed after him, sword by my side, taking deep breaths, clearing my mind, focusing on the death-struggle to come. Although this could have been Vancha\u0027s battle, a part of me had known all along that it would come down to this. Steve and I were opposite sides of a coin, linked since childhood, first by friendship, then hatred. It was only fitting that the final confrontation should fall to the two of us.\\n\\n I entered the cool darkness of the underpass. It took my eyes a few seconds to adjust. When they did, I saw Steve waiting, right eye twitching nervously. The river gurgled softly beside us, the only noise except for our panting and chattering teeth.\\n\\n \"There is where we settle matters, once and for all, in the dark,\" Steve said.\\n\\n \"As good a place as any,\" I replied.\\n\\n Steve raised his left palm. I could vaguely make out the shape of the pink cross he\u0027d carved into his flesh eighteen years before. \"Remember when I did this?\" he asked. \"That night, I swore I\u0027d kill you and Creepy Crepsley.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re halfway there,\" I noted dryly. \"You must be delighted.\"\\n\\n \"Not really,\" he said. \"To be honest, I miss old Creepy. The world\u0027s not the same without him. I\u0027ll miss you even more. You\u0027ve been the driving force behind everything I\u0027ve done since I was a child. Without you, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll have much of an interest in life. If possible, I\u0027d let you go. I enjoy our games ¨C the hunt, the traps, the fights. I\u0027d happily keep doing it, over and over, a new twist here, a fresh shock there.\"\\n\\n \"But life doesn\u0027t work like that,\" I said. \"Everything has to end.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Steve said sadly. \"That\u0027s one thing I can\u0027t change.\" His mood passed and he regarded me with a sneer. \"Here\u0027s where you end, Darren Shan. This is your grand finale. Have you made your peace with the vampire gods?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do that later,\" I snarled, and swung my sword wide, moving forward so that on its return arc he\u0027d be within range. But before it had completed its first arc, the tip of the sword smashed into the wall. It bounced off in a shower of sparks and a shock ran down my arm.\\n\\n \"Silly boy,\" Steve purred, mimicking Mr Tiny. He raised a knife. \"No room here for swords.\"\\n\\n Steve leapt forward and jabbed the knife at me. I pulled back and lobbed my sword at him, momentarily halting him. In that second, I drew one of the knives I\u0027d brought from Annie\u0027s kitchen. When Steve advanced, I was ready. I caught his thrust with the hilt of my knife and turned his blade aside.\\n\\n There was no room in the underpass to circle one another, so we had to jab and stab, ducking and weaving to avoid each other\u0027s blows. The conditions actually played into my favour ¨C in the open I\u0027d have had to be nimbler on my feet, spinning to keep up with Steve. That would have exhausted me. Here, since we were so cramped, I could stand still and direct my rapidly dwindling strength into my knife hand.\\n\\n We fought silently, fast, sharp, impulsive. Steve nicked the flesh of my forearm ¨C I nicked his. He opened shallow wounds on my stomach and chest ¨C I repaid the compliment. He almost cut my nose off ¨C I nearly severed his left ear.\\n\\n Then Steve came at me from the left, taking advantage of my dead arm. He grabbed the material of my shirt and pulled me towards him, driving his knife hard at my belly with his other hand. I rolled with the force of his pull, throwing myself into him. His knife cut the wall of my stomach, a deep wound, but my momentum carried me forward despite the pain. I drove him down, landing awkwardly on him as he hit the path. His right hand flew out by his side, fingers snapping open. His knife shot free and struck the river with a splash, vanishing from sight in an instant.\\n\\n Steve brought his empty right hand up, to push me off. I stabbed at it with my knife and hit home, spearing him through his forearm. He screamed. I freed my knife before he could knock it from my grip, raised it to shoulder height and redirected it, so the tip was pointing at Steve\u0027s throat. His eyes shot to the gleam of the blade and his breath caught. This was it. I had him. He\u0027d been out-fought and he knew it. One quick thrust of the knife and-\\n\\n Searing pain. A white flash inside my head. I thought Gannen had recovered and struck me from behind, but he hadn\u0027t. It was an aftershock from when I blooded Darius. Vancha had warned me about this. My limbs trembled. A roaring in my ears, drowning out all other sounds. I dry-heaved and fell off Steve, almost tumbling into the river. \"No!\" I tried to scream. \"Not now!\" But I couldn\u0027t form the words. I was in the grip of immense pain, and could do nothing against it.\\n\\n Time seemed to collapse. Gripped by panic, I was dimly aware of Steve crawling on top of me. He wrestled my knife from my hand. There was a sharp stabbing sensation in my stomach, followed by another. Steve crowed, \"Now I have you! Now you\u0027re gonna die.\" Something blurry passed in front of my eyes, then back again. Fighting the white light inside my head, I got my eyes to focus. It was the knife. Steve had pulled it out and was waving it in my face, teasing me, sure he\u0027d won, prolonging the moment of triumph.\\n\\n But Steve had miscalculated. The pain of the stabbing brought me back from the brink of all-out confusion. The agony in my gut worked against the pain in my head, and the world began to swim back into place around me. Steve was perched on top of me, laughing. But I wasn\u0027t afraid. Unknown to himself, he was helping me. I was able to think halfway straight now, able to plan, able to act.\\n\\n My right hand stole to waist of my trousers as Steve continued to mock me. I gripped the handle of a second knife. I caught a glimpse of Mr Tiny peering over Steve\u0027s shoulder. He\u0027d seen my hand moving and knew what was coming. He was nodding, though I\u0027m not sure if he was encouraging me or merely bobbing his head up and down with excitement.\\n\\n I lay still, gathering my very last dredges of energy together, letting Steve torment me with wild promises of what was to come. I was bleeding freely from the stab wounds in my stomach. I wasn\u0027t sure if I\u0027d be alive come the dawn, but of one thing I was certain ¨C Steve would die before me.\\n\\n \"-and when I finish with your toes and fingers, I\u0027ll move on to your nose and ears!\" Steve yelled. \"But first I\u0027ll cut your eyelids off, so you can see everything that I\u0027m gonna do. After that I\u0027ll-\"\\n\\n \"Steve,\" I wheezed, stopping him midflow. \"Want to know the secret of winning a fight like this? Less talking ¨C more stabbing.\"\\n\\n I lunged at him, using the muscles of my stomach to force my body up. Steve wasn\u0027t prepared for it. I knocked him backwards. As he fell, I swung my legs around, then pushed with my knees and feet, so I drove him all the way back with the full weight of my body. He hit the pavement with a grunt, for the second time within the space of a few minutes. This time he managed to hold on to his knife, but that was no use to him. I wasn\u0027t going to make the same mistake twice.\\n\\n No hesitation. No pausing to pick my point. No cynical, memorable last words. I put my trust in the gods of the vampires and blindly thrust my knife forward. I brought it around and down in a savage arc, and by luck or fate drove it into the centre of Steve\u0027s left breast ¨C clean through his shrivelled forgery of a heart! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-12.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \\n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
