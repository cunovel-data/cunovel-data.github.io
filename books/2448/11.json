{"id":79802,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"We followed Steve and Gannen down the hill at the rear of the stadium. They were fleeing towards the river, but they weren\u0027t racing at top speed. Either one of them was injured or, like ourselves, they\u0027d simply accepted the fact that we had to fight, an evenly matched contest, to the bitter, bloody end.\n As we jogged down the hill, leaving the stadium, lights and noises behind, my headache lessened. I would have been glad of that, except now that I was able to focus, I realized how physically drained I was. I\u0027d been operating on reserve energy for a long time and had just about run dry. Even the simplest movement was a huge chore. All I could do was carry on as long as possible and hope I got an adrenaline burst when we caught up with our prey.\n As we reached level ground at the bottom of the hill, I stumbled and almost fell. Luckily Vancha had been keeping an eye on me. He caught and steadied me. \"Feel bad?\" he asked.\n \"Awful,\" I groaned.\n \"Maybe you\u0027re not meant to go any further,\" he said. \"Perhaps you should rest here and-\"\n \"Save your breath,\" I stopped him. \"I\u0027m going on, even if I have to crawl.\"\n Vancha laughed, then tilted my head back and examined my face, his small eyes unusually dark. \"You\u0027ll make a fine vampire,\" he said. \"I hope I\u0027m around to celebrate your coming of age.\"\n \"You\u0027re not getting defeatist on me, are you?\" I grunted.\n \"No.\" He smiled weakly. \"We\u0027ll win. Of course we will. I just...\"\n He stopped, slapped my back and urged me on. Wearily, every step an effort, I threw myself after Steve and Gannen Harst again. I did my best to match Vancha\u0027s pace, swinging my legs as evenly as I could, keeping the rest of my body limp, relaxed, saving energy.\n Steve and Gannen reached the river and turned right, jogging along the bank. As they came to the arch of a bridge spanning the river, they stopped. It looked like they were having an argument. Gannen was trying to pick Steve up ¨C I assumed he meant to flit, with Steve on his back, as they\u0027d escaped from us once before. Steve was having none of it. He slapped his protector\u0027s hands away, gesturing furiously. Then, as we closed upon them, Gannen\u0027s shoulders sagged and he nodded wearily. The pair turned away from the pass beneath the bridge, drew their weapons and stood waiting for us.\n We slowed and walked the rest of the way. I could hear Mr Tiny and Evanna close behind ¨C they\u0027d caught up to us within the last few seconds ¨C but I didn\u0027t turn to look back.\n \"You could use your shurikens,\" I whispered to Vancha as we came within range of Steve and Gannen Harst.\n \"That would be dishonourable,\" Vancha replied. \"They\u0027ve faced us openly, in expectation of a fair fight. We must confront them.\"\n He was right. Killing mercilessly wasn\u0027t the vampire way. But I half wished he\u0027d put his principles aside, for once, and fire his throwing stars at them until they dropped. It would be much simpler and surer that way.\n We drew to a halt a couple of metres short of Steve and Gannen. Steve\u0027s eyes were alight with excitement and a slight shade of fear ¨C he knew there were no guarantees now, no more opportunities for dirty tricks or games. It was a plain, fair fight to the death, and that was something he couldn\u0027t control.\n \"Greetings, brother,\" Gannen Harst said, bowing his head.\n \"Greetings,\" Vancha replied stiffly. \"I\u0027m glad you face us like true creatures of the night at last. Perhaps in death you can find again the honour which you abandoned during life.\"\n \"Honour will be shared by all here tonight,\" Gannen said, \"both the living and the dead.\"\n \"They don\u0027t half go on a lot,\" Steve sighed. He squared up to me. \"Ready to die, Shan?\"\n I stepped forward. \"If that\u0027s what fate has in store for me ¨C yes,\" I answered. \"But I\u0027m also ready to kill.\" With that I raised my sword and struck the first blow of the fight which would decide the outcome of the War of the Scars.\n Steve stood his ground, brought his own sword up ¨C it was shorter and easier to handle than mine ¨C and turned my blow aside. Gannen Harst stabbed at me with his long, straight sword. Vancha slapped the blade wide of its target and pulled me out of immediate range of his brother.\n Vancha only gave me a relatively gentle tug, but in my weakened state I staggered backwards and wound up in an untidy mess on the ground, close to Mr Tiny and Evanna. By the time I struggled to my feet, Vancha was locked in combat with Steve and Gannen Harst, hands a blur as he defended himself against their swords with his bare palms.\n \"He\u0027s a fierce creature, isn\u0027t he?\" Mr Tiny remarked to his daughter. \"Quite the beast of nature. I like him.\"\n Evanna didn\u0027t reply. All her senses were focused on the battle, and there was worry and uncertainty in her eyes . I knew in that moment that she\u0027d told the truth and really didn\u0027t know which way this would go.\n I turned away from the onlookers and caught quick flashes of the fight which was unfolding at superhuman speed. Steve nicked Vancha\u0027s left arm near the top ¨C Vancha kicked him in the chest in return. Gannen\u0027s sword scraped down Vancha\u0027s left side, slicing a thin gouge from breast to waist ¨C Vancha replied by grabbing his brother\u0027s sword hand and wrenching it back, snapping the bones of his wrist. Gannen gasped with pain as he dropped the sword, then ducked for it and grabbed it with his left hand. As he came to his feet again, Vancha struck his head with his right knee. Gannen fell away with a heavy grunt.\n Vancha spun round to deal with Steve, but Steve was already upon him, making short sweeps with his sword, keeping Vancha at bay. Vancha tried to grab the sword, but only succeeded in having the flesh of his palms cut open. I staggered up beside him. I wasn\u0027t of much use right then ¨C I could barely raise my sword, and my legs dragged like dead weights ¨C but at least it provided Steve with a double threat. If I could distract him, Vancha might be able to penetrate his defences and strike.\n As I drew level with Vancha, panting and sweating, Gannen swung back into battle, dazed but determined, chopping angrily at Vancha, forcing him to retreat. I stabbed at Gannen, but Steve perted my sword with his, then let go of the handle with one hand and punched me between the eyes. I dropped back, startled, and Steve drove the tip of his sword at my face.\n If he\u0027d had both hands on the sword, he\u0027d have thrust it through me. But one-handed, he wasn\u0027t able to direct it as powerfully as he wished. I managed to knock it aside with my left arm. A deep cut opened up just below my elbow and I felt all the strength leave the fingers of that hand.\n Steve stabbed at me again. I raised my sword to protect myself. Too late I realized he\u0027d only feinted. Wheeling around, he threw himself into me, right shoulder first. He struck me heavily in the chest and I fell back, winded losing hold of my sword. There was a yell behind me and I crashed into Vancha. Both of us went down, Vancha taken by surprise, arms and legs entangled with mine.\n It took Vancha no more than a second to free himself ¨C but that second was all Gannen Harst required. Darting forward, almost too fast for me to see, he stuck the tip of his sword into the small of Vancha\u0027s back ¨C then shoved it all the way through and out the front of Vancha\u0027s stomach!\n Vancha\u0027s eyes and mouth shot wide open. Gannen stood behind him a moment. Then he stepped away and pulled his sword free. Blood gushed out of Vancha, both in front and behind, and he collapsed in agony, face twisted, limbs thrashing.\n \"May your gods forgive me, brother,\" Gannen whispered, his face haggard, eyes haunted. \"Though I fear I\u0027ll never forgive myself.\"\n I scrabbled away from the downed Prince, chasing my sword. Steve stood close by, laughing. With an effort, Gannen regained control and set about securing victory. Hurrying over to me, he stood on my sword so that I couldn\u0027t lift it, sheathed his own blade and grabbed my head with his good left hand. \"Hurry!\" he barked at Steve. \"Kill him quick!\"\n \"What\u0027s the rush?\" Steve muttered.\n \"If Vancha dies of the wound I gave him, we\u0027ll have broken the rules of Mr Tiny\u0027s prophecy!\" Gannen shouted.\n Steve pulled a face. \"Bloody prophecies,\" he grumbled. \"Maybe I\u0027ll let him die and see what happens. Maybe I don\u0027t care about Tiny or...\" He stopped and rolled his eyes. \"Oh, how silly we are! The answer\u0027s obvious ¨C I\u0027ll kill Vancha before he dies of your wound. That way we\u0027ll fulfil the requirements of the stupid prophecy and I\u0027ll get to hang on to Darren, so I can torture him later.\"\n \"Clever boy,\" I heard Mr Tiny murmur.\n \"Have it any way you wish!\" Gannen roared. \"But if you\u0027re going to kill him, kill him now, so that-\"\n \"No !\" someone screamed. Before anyone could react, a large shape shot out of the underpass beneath the bridge and hurled itself at Gannen, knocking him off me, almost toppling him into the river. Sitting up, I got a shocked fix on my most unlikely of rescuers ¨C R. V. !\n \"Not gonna let you do it, man!\" R.V. screamed, pounding Gannen Harst with his hooks. \"You\u0027re evil!\"\n Gannen had been taken completely unawares, but he swiftly recovered, fumbled his sword free of its scabbard, and dug at R.V. with it. R.V. caught the sword with his gold right-handed hooks and smashed it against the ground, snapping it in two. With a roar of triumph, he slammed his silver left-handed hook into the side of Gannen\u0027s head. There was a crack and Gannen\u0027s eyes went blank. He slumped beneath R.V., unconscious. R.V. howled with joy, then drew both arms back to bring them down sharply and finish Gannen off.\n Before R.V. could strike, Steve stepped up behind him and forced a knife up beneath his bushy beard, deep into his throat. R.V. shuddered and bowled Steve over. R.V. stood, spinning crazily, grabbing for the handle of the knife with his hooks. After missing it several times, he fell down, landing on his knees, head thrown back.\n R.V. knelt there a moment, swaying sickeningly. Then his arms slowly rose. He gazed at the gold and silver hooks, his face glowing with wonder. \"My hands,\" he said softly, and although his voice was gurgly with blood, his words were clear. \"I can see them. My hands. They\u0027re back. Everything\u0027s OK now. I\u0027m normal again, man.\" Then his arms dropped, his smile and pale red eyes froze in place, and his soul passed quietly on to the next world. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sons-of-destiny-the-saga-of-darren-shan-12/page-11.html","bookId":2448,"book":{"id":2448,"title":"Sons of Destiny (The Saga of Darren Shan #12)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #12: Sons of Destiny \n After Darren was told by Steve that Darius is also Darren\u0027s nephew, Darren couldn\u0027t bear to kill him.
