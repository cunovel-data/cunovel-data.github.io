{"id":97275,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Therefore was a single man only first created, to teach thee that whosoever destroyeth a single soul from the children of man, Scripture charges him as though he had destroyed the whole world. -The Talmud Chapter 1 For seven consecutive Fridays I got telephone calls from him. I wasn\u0027t always there to receive them. It didn\u0027t matter, because he and I had nothing to say to each other. If I was out when he called, there would be a message slip in my box when I got back to the hotel. I would glance at it and throw it away and forget about it. Then, on the second Friday in April, he didn\u0027t call. I spent the evening around the corner at Armstrong\u0027s, drinking bourbon and coffee and watching a couple of interns fail to impress a couple of nurses. The place thinned out early for a Friday, and around two Trina went home and Billie locked the door to keep Ninth Avenue outside. We had a couple of drinks and talked about the Knicks and how it all depended on Willis Reed. At a quarter of three I took my coat off the peg and went home. No messages. It didn\u0027t have to mean anything. Our arrangement was that he would call every Friday to let me know he was alive. If I was there to catch his call, we would say hello to each other. Otherwise he\u0027d leave a message: Your laundry is ready. But he could have forgotten or he could be drunk or almost anything. I got undressed and into bed and lay on my side looking out the window. There\u0027s an office building ten or twelve blocks downtown where they leave the lights on at night. You can gauge the pollution level fairly accurately by how much the lights appear to flicker. They were not only flickering wildly that night, they even had a yellow cast to them. I rolled over and closed my eyes and thought about the phone call that hadn\u0027t come. I decided he hadn\u0027t forgotten and he wasn\u0027t drunk. The Spinner was dead. They called him the Spinner because of a habit he had. He carried an old silver dollar as a good-luck charm, and he would haul it out of his pants pocket all the time, prop it up on a table top with his left forefinger, then cock his right middle finger and give the edge of the coin a flick. If he was talking to you, his eyes would stay on the spinning coin while he spoke, and he seemed to be directing his words as much to the dollar as to you. I had last witnessed this performance on a weekday afternoon in early February. He found me at my usual corner table in Armstrong\u0027s. He was dressed Broadway sharp: a pearl-gray suit with a lot of flash, a dark-gray monogrammed shirt, a silk tie the same color as the shirt, a pearl tie tack. He was wearing a pair of those platform shoes that give you an extra inch and a half or so. They boosted his height to maybe five six, five seven. The coat over his arm was navy blue and looked like cashmere. \"Matthew Scudder,\" he said. \"You look the same, and how long has it been?\" \"A couple of years.\" \"Too damn long.\" He put his coat on an empty chair, settled a slim attachй case on top of it, and placed a narrow-brimmed gray hat on top of the attachй case. He seated himself across the table from me and dug his lucky charm out of his pocket. I watched him set it spinning. \"Too goddamned long, Matt,\" he told the coin. \"You\u0027re looking good, Spinner.\" \"Been havin\u0027 a nice run of luck.\" \"That\u0027s always good.\" \"Long as it keeps runnin\u0027.\" Trina came over, and I ordered another cup of coffee and a shot of bourbon. Spinner turned to her and worked his narrow little face into a quizzical frown. \"Gee, I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Do you suppose I could have a glass of milk?\" She said he could and went away to fetch it. \"I can\u0027t drink no more,\" he said. \"It\u0027s this fuckin\u0027 ulcer.\" \"They tell me it goes with success.\" \"It goes with aggravation is what it goes with. Doc gave me a list of what I can\u0027t eat. Everything I like is on it. I got it aced, I can go to the best restaurants and then I can order myself a plate of fuckin\u0027 cottage cheese.\" He picked up the dollar and gave it a spin. I had known him over the years while I was on the force. He\u0027d been picked up maybe a dozen times, always on minor things, but he\u0027d never done any time. He always managed to buy his way off the hook, with either money or information. He set me up for a good collar, a receiver of stolen goods, and another time he gave us a handle on a homicide case. In between he would peddle us information, trading something he\u0027d overheard for a ten- or twenty-dollar bill. He was small and unimpressive and he knew the right moves and a lot of people were stupid enough to talk in his presence. He said, \"Matt, I didn\u0027t just happen to walk in here off the street.\" \"I had that feeling.\" \"Yeah.\" The dollar started to wobble, and he snatched it up. He had very quick hands. We always figured him for a sometime pickpocket, but I don\u0027t think anybody ever nailed him for it. \"The thing is, I got problems.\" \"They go with ulcers, too.\" \"You bet your ass they do.\" Spin. \"What it is, I got something I want you to hold for me.\" \"Oh?\" He took a sip of milk. He put the glass down and reached over to drum his fingers against the attachй case. \"I got an envelope in here. What I want is for you to hold on to it for me. Put it some place safe where nobody\u0027s gonna run across it, you know?\" \"What\u0027s in the envelope?\" He gave his head an impatient little shake. \"Part of it is you don\u0027t have to know what\u0027s in the envelope.\" \"How long do I have to hold it?\" \"Well, that\u0027s the whole thing.\" Spin. \"See, lots of things can happen to a person. I could walk out, step off the curb, get hit by the Ninth Avenue bus. All the things that can happen to a person, I mean, you just never know.\" \"Is somebody trying for you, Spinner?\" The eyes came up to meet mine, then dropped quickly. \"It could be,\" he said. \"You know who?\" \"I don\u0027t even know if, never mind who.\" Wobble, snatch. Spin. \"The envelope\u0027s your insurance.\" \"Something like that.\" I sipped coffee. I said, \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m right for this, Spinner. The usual thing, you take your envelope to a lawyer and work out a set of instructions. He tosses it into a safe and that\u0027s it.\" \"I thought of that.\" \"So?\" \"No point to it. The kind of lawyers I know, the minute I walk out of their office they got the fuckin\u0027 envelope open. A straight lawyer, he\u0027s gonna run his eyes over me and go out and wash his hands.\" \"Not necessarily.\" \"There\u0027s something else. Say I get hit by a bus, then the lawyer would only have to get the envelope to you. This way we cut out the middleman, right?\" \"Why do I have to wind up with the envelope?\" \"You\u0027ll find out when you open it. If you open it.\" \"Everything\u0027s very roundabout, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Everything\u0027s very tricky lately, Matt. Ulcers and aggravation.\" \"And better clothes than I ever saw you wear in your life.\" \"Yeah, they can fuckin\u0027 bury me in \u0027em.\" Spin. \"Look, all you gotta do is take the envelope, you stick it in a safe-deposit box, something, somewhere, that\u0027s up to you.\" \"Suppose I get hit by a bus?\" He thought it over and we worked it out. The envelope would go under the rug in my hotel room. If I died suddenly, Spinner could come around and retrieve his property. He wouldn\u0027t need a key. He\u0027d never needed one in the past. We worked out details, the weekly phone call, the bland message if I wasn\u0027t in. I ordered another drink. Spinner still had plenty of milk left. I asked him why he had picked me. \"Well, you were always straight with me, Matt. You been off the force how long? A couple of years?\" \"Something like that.\" \"Yeah, you quit. I\u0027m not good on the details. You killed some kid or something?\" \"Yeah. Line of duty, a bullet took a bad hop.\" \"Catch a lot of static from on top?\" I looked at my coffee and thought about it. A summer night, the heat almost visible in the air, the air conditioning working overtime in the Spectacle, a bar in Washington Heights where a cop got his drinks on the house. I was off duty, except you never really are, and two kids picked that night to hold up the place. They shot the bartender dead on their way out. I chased them into the street, killed one of them, splintered the other one\u0027s thigh bone. But one shot was off and took a richochet that bounced it right into the eye of a seven-year-old girl named Estrellita Rivera. Right in the eye, and through soft tissue and on into the brain. \"That was out of line,\" the Spinner said. \"I shouldn\u0027ta brought it up.\" \"No, that\u0027s all right. I didn\u0027t get any static. I got a commendation, as a matter of fact. There was a hearing, and I was completely exonerated.\" \"And then you quit the force.\" \"I sort of lost my taste for the work. And for other things. A house on the Island. A wife. My sons.\" \"I guess it happens,\" he said. \"I guess it does.\" \"So what you\u0027re doing, you\u0027re sort of a private cop, huh?\" I shrugged. \"I don\u0027t have a license. Sometimes I do favors for people and they pay me for it.\" \"Well, getting back to our little business…\" Spin. \"You\u0027d be doing me a favor is what you\u0027d be doing.\" \"If you think so.\" He picked up the dollar in mid-spin, looked at it, set it down on the blue-and-white checkered tablecloth. I said, \"You don\u0027t want to get killed, Spinner.\" \"Fuck, no.\" \"Can\u0027t you get out from under?\" \"Maybe. Maybe not. Let\u0027s don\u0027t talk about that part of it, huh?\" \"Whatever you say.\" \" \u0027Cause if somebody wants to kill you, what the fuck can you do about it? Nothin\u0027.\" \"You\u0027re probably right.\" \"You\u0027ll handle this for me, Matt?\" \"I\u0027ll hang on to your envelope. I\u0027m not saying what I\u0027ll do if I have to open it, because I don\u0027t know what\u0027s in it.\" \"If it happens, then you\u0027ll know.\" \"No guarantees I\u0027ll do it, whatever it is.\" He took a long look at me, reading something in my face that I didn\u0027t know was there. \"You\u0027ll do it,\" he said. \"Maybe.\" \"You\u0027ll do it. And if you don\u0027t I won\u0027t know about it, so what the fuck. Listen, what do you want in front?\" \"I don\u0027t know what it is I\u0027m supposed to do.\" \"I mean for keeping the envelope. How much do you want?\" I never know how to set fees. I thought for a moment. I said, \"That\u0027s a nice suit you\u0027re wearing.\" \"Huh? Thanks.\" \"Where\u0027d you get it?\" \"Phil Kronfeld\u0027s. Over on Broadway?\" \"I know where it is.\" \"You really like it?\" \"It looks good on you. What did it set you back?\" \"Three twenty.\" \"Then that\u0027s my fee.\" \"You want the fuckin\u0027 suit?\" \"I want three hundred and twenty dollars.\" \"Oh.\" He tossed his head, amused. \"You had me goin\u0027 there for a minute. I couldn\u0027t understand what the fuck you\u0027d want with the suit.\" \"I don\u0027t think it would fit.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-1.html","bookId":2321,"book":{"id":2321,"title":"Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2)","description":"Storyline: Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2) Small-time stoolie, Jake \"The Spinner\" Jablon, made a lot of new enemies when he switched careers, from informer to blackmailer.
