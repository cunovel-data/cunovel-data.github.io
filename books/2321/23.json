He probably told you he\u0027d have you divorce Ethridge once he\u0027d come into enough money to make it worthwhile.\" \"How did you know?\" \"I told you. Just a guess. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027d have done it that way. He would have wanted the whole thing. He\u0027d have waited until your husband inherited his money, and then he would have taken his time setting it up right, and all of a sudden you\u0027d turn out to be a very rich widow.\" \"Oh, God.\" \"Then you\u0027d remarry and your name would be Beverly Lundgren. How long do you suppose it would have taken him to put another notch on his knife.\" \"God!\" \"Of course, it\u0027s just a guess.\" \"No.\" She shivered, and all of a sudden her face lost a lot of its polish and she looked like the girl she had stopped being a long time ago. \"He\u0027d have done it just that way,\" she said. \"It\u0027s more than a guess. That\u0027s just the way he would have done it.\" \"Another glass of wine?\" \"No.\" She put her hand on mine. \"I was all primed to be mad at you for turning my life around. Maybe that\u0027s not all you did. Maybe you saved it.\" \"We\u0027ll never know, will we?\" \"No.\" She crushed out her cigarette. She said, \"Well, where do I go from here? I was beginning to get used to a life of leisure, Matt. I thought I carried it off with a certain flair.\" \"That you did.\" \"Now all of a sudden I\u0027ve got to find a way to make a living.\" \"You\u0027ll think of something, Beverly.\" Her eyes focused on mine. She said, \"That\u0027s the first time you used my name, do you know that?\" \"I know.\" We sat there for a while looking at each other. She reached for a cigarette, changed her mind, and pushed it back in the pack. \"Well, what do you know,\" she said. I didn\u0027t say anything. \"I thought I didn\u0027t do a thing for you. I was beginning to worry that I was losing my touch. Is there some place we can go? I\u0027m afraid my place isn\u0027t my place any more.\" \"There\u0027s my hotel.\" \"You take me to all the class joints,\" she said. She got to her feet and picked up her bag. \"Let\u0027s go. Right now, huh?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-23.html","bookId":2321,"book":{"id":2321,"title":"Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2)","description":"Storyline: Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2) Small-time stoolie, Jake \"The Spinner\" Jablon, made a lot of new enemies when he switched careers, from informer to blackmailer. And the more \"clients, \" he figured, the more money - and more people eager to see him dead. So no one is surprised when the pigeon is found floating in the East River with his skull bashed in. And what\u0027s worse, no one cares - except Matthew Scudder. The ex-cop-turned-private-eye is no conscientious avenging angel. But he\u0027s willing to risk his own life and limb to confront Spinner\u0027s most murderously aggressive marks. A job\u0027s a job after all - and Scudder\u0027s been paid to find a killer - by the victim...in advance.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:31 PM"}}
