{"id":97284,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"I wasn\u0027t going to ask.\"\n \"What\u0027s the story?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure there is one. I think I saw him a little while ago in Polly\u0027s.\"\n \"Maybe he\u0027s making the rounds.\"\n \"Uh-huh. Same rounds I\u0027m making.\"\n \"So?\"\n I shrugged. \"Probably nothing. Thanks for the surveillance work, away.\"\n \"Do I get a badge?\"\n \"And a decoder ring.\"\n \"Neat,\" she said.\n I waited him out. He was definitely paying attention to me. I couldn\u0027t tell whether he knew I was taking an interest in him as well. I didn\u0027t want to look straight at him.\n He could have tagged me from Polly\u0027s. I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d seen him there, just felt I\u0027d noticed him somewhere or other. If he\u0027d picked me up at Polly\u0027s, then it wasn\u0027t hard to tie him to Beverly Ethridge; she could have set up the date in the first place in order to put a tag on me. But even if he had been at Polly\u0027s, that didn\u0027t prove anything; he could have picked me up earlier and tailed me there. I hadn\u0027t been making myself hard to find. Everybody knew where I lived, and I\u0027d spent the whole day in the neighborhood.\n It was probably around nine thirty when I noticed him, maybe closer to ten. It was almost eleven when he packed it in and left. I had decided he was going to leave before I did, and I would have sat there until Billie closed the place if necessary. It didn\u0027t take that long, and I hadn\u0027t thought it would. The Marlboro man didn\u0027t look like the sort who enjoyed biding his time in a Ninth Avenue gin mill, even as congenial a gin mill as Armstrong\u0027s. He was too active and western and outdoorsy, and by eleven o\u0027clock he had mounted his horse and ridden off into the sunset.\n A few minutes after he left, Trina came over and sat down across from me. She was still on duty, so I couldn\u0027t buy her a drink. \"I have more to report,\" she said. \"Billie has never seen him before. He hopes he never sees him again, he says, because he does not like to serve alcoholic beverages to men with eyes like that.\"\n \"Eyes like what?\"\n \"He did not go into detail. You could probably ask him. What else? Oh, yes. He ordered beer. Two of them, in about as many hours. Wurzburger dark, if you care.\"\n \"Not awfully.\"\n \"He also said-\"\n \"Shit.\"\n \"Billie rarely says \u0027shit.\u0027 He says \u0027fuck\u0027 a lot, but rarely \u0027shit,\u0027 and he didn\u0027t say it now. What\u0027s the matter?\"\n But I was up from the table and on my way to the bar. Billie ambled over, polishing a glass with a towel. He said, \"You move fast for a big man, stranger.\"\n \"My mind moves slow. That customer you had-\"\n \"The Marlboro man, Trina calls him.\"\n \"That\u0027s the one. I don\u0027t suppose you got around to washing his glass yet, did you?\"\n \"Yes, as a matter of fact I did. This is it here, as best I recall.\" He held it up for my inspection. \"See? Spotless.\"\n \"Shit.\"\n \"That\u0027s what Jimmie says when I don\u0027t wash them. What\u0027s the matter?\"\n \"Well, unless the bastard was wearing gloves, I have just done something stupid.\"\n \"Gloves. Oh. Fingerprints?\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"I thought that only worked on the tube.\"\n \"Not when they come as a gift. Like on a beer glass. Shit. If he ever comes in again, which would be too much to hope for-\"\n \"I pick up the glass with a towel and put it some place very safe.\"\n \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\n \"If you\u0027d told me…\"\n \"I know. I should have thought of it.\"\n \"All I was interested in was seeing the last of him. I don\u0027t like people like him anywhere, and especially in bars. He made two beers last an hour apiece, and that was just fine with me. I was not about to push drinks on him. The less he drank and the sooner he left, the happier he made me.\"\n \"Did he talk at all?\"\n \"Just to order the beers.\"\n \"You catch any kind of an accent?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t notice it at the time. Let me think.\" He closed his eyes for a few seconds. \"No. Standard American nondescript. I usually notice voices, and I can\u0027t dredge up anything special about his. I can\u0027t believe he\u0027s from New York, but what does that prove?\"\n \"Not too much. Trina said you didn\u0027t like his eyes.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t like them at all.\"\n \"How so?\"\n \"The feeling they gave me. It\u0027s hard to describe. I couldn\u0027t even tell you what color they were, although I think they were light rather than dark. But there was something about them, they stopped at the surface.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I know what you mean.\"\n \"There was no depth to them. They could have been glass eyes, almost. Did you happen to watch Watergate?\"\n \"Some of it. Not much.\"\n \"One of those pricks, one of the ones with a German name-\"\n \"They all had German names, didn\u0027t they?\"\n \"No, but there were two of them. Not Haldeman. The other one.\"\n \"Ehrlichman.\"\n \"That\u0027s the prick. Did you happen to see him? Did you notice his eyes? No depth to them.\"\n \"A Marlboro man with eyes like Ehrlichman.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t connected with Watergate or anything, is it, Matt?\"\n \"Only in spirit.\"\n I went back to my table and had a cup of coffee. I\u0027d have liked to sweeten it with bourbon, but I decided it wasn\u0027t sensible. The Marlboro man didn\u0027t figure to try to take me tonight. There were too many people who could place him at the scene. This was simple reconnaissance. If he was going to try anything on, it would be some other time.\n That was the way it looked to me, but I wasn\u0027t sure enough by my reasoning to walk home with too much bourbon in my bloodstream. I was probably right, but I didn\u0027t want to risk being very wrong.\n I took what I\u0027d seen of the guy and pasted in Ehrlichman\u0027s eyes and Billie\u0027s general impression of him, and I tried to match up the picture with my three angels. I couldn\u0027t make anything work. He could be some construction roughneck off one of Prager\u0027s projects, he could be a healthy young stud Beverly Ethridge liked to have around, he could be pro talent Huysendahl had hired for the occasion. Fingerprints would have given me a make on him, but my mental reflexes had been too slow for me to take advantage of the opportunity. If I could find out who he was I could come up around him from behind, but now I had to let him make his play and meet him head on.\n I guess it was about twelve thirty when I paid my tab and left. I eased the door open carefully, feeling a little foolish, and I scanned both sides of Ninth Avenue in both directions. I didn\u0027t see my Marlboro man, or anything else that looked at all menacing.\n I started toward the corner of Fifty-seventh Street, and for the first time since it all started I had the feeling of being a target. I had set myself up this way quite deliberately, and it had certainly seemed like a good idea at the time, but ever since the Marlboro man had turned up things had become very different. It was real now, and that was what made all the difference.\n There was movement in a doorway ahead of me, and I was up on the balls of my feet before I recognized the old woman. She was in her usual spot in the doorway of the boutique called Sartor Resartus. She\u0027s always there when the weather\u0027s decent. She always asks for money. Most of the time I give her something.\n She said, \"Mister, if you could spare-\" and I found some coins in my pocket and gave them to her. \"God will bless you,\" she said.\n I told her I hoped she was right. I walked on toward the corner, and it\u0027s a good thing it wasn\u0027t raining that night, because I heard her scream before I heard the car. She let out a shriek, and I spun around in time to see a car with its high beams on vault the curb at me.\n Chapter 10\n I didn\u0027t have time to think it over. I guess my reflexes were good. At least they were good enough. I was off balance from spinning around when the woman screamed, but I didn\u0027t stop to get my balance. I just threw myself to the right. I landed on a shoulder and rolled up against the building.\n It was barely enough. If a driver has the nerve, he can leave you no room at all. All he has to do is bounce his car off the side of the building. That can be rough on the car and rough on the building, but it\u0027s roughest of all on the person caught between the two. I thought he might do that, and then when he yanked the wheel at the last minute I thought he might do it accidentally, fishtailing the car\u0027s rear end and swatting me like a fly.\n He didn\u0027t miss by much. I felt a rush of air as the car hurtled past me. Then I rolled over and watched him cut back off the sidewalk and onto the avenue. He snapped off a parking meter on his way, bounced when he hit the asphalt, then put the pedal on the floor and hit the corner just as the light turned red. He sailed right through the light, but then, so do half the cars in New York. I don\u0027t remember the last time I saw a cop ticket anybody for a moving violation. They just don\u0027t have the time.\n \"These crazy, crazy drivers!\"\n It was the old woman, standing beside me now, making tsk sounds.\n \"They just drink their whiskey,\" she said, \"and they smoke their reefers, and then they go out for a joy ride. You could have been killed.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And after all that, he didn\u0027t even stop to see if you were all right.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t very considerate.\"\n \"People are not considerate any more.\"\n I got to my feet and brushed myself off. I was shaking, and badly rattled. She said, \"Mister, if you could spare…\" and then her eyes clouded slightly and she frowned at some private puzzlement. \"No,\" she said. \"You just gave me money, didn\u0027t you? I\u0027m very sorry. It\u0027s difficult to remember.\"\n I reached for my wallet. \"Now this is a ten-dollar bill,\" I said, pressing it into her hand. \"You make sure you remember, all right? Make sure you get the right amount of change when you spend it. Do you understand?\"\n \"Oh, dear,\" she said.\n \"Now you\u0027d better go home and get some sleep. All right?\"\n \"Oh, dear,\" she said. \"Ten dollars. A ten-dollar bill. Oh, God bless you, sir.\"\n \"He just did,\" I said.\n ISAIAH was behind the desk when I got back to the hotel. He\u0027s a light-skinned West Indian with bright blue eyes and kinky rust-colored hair. He has large dark freckles on his cheeks and on the backs of his hands. He likes the midnight-to-eight shift because it\u0027s quiet and he can sit behind the desk working double-acrostics, toking periodically from a bottle of cough syrup with codeine in it.\n He does the puzzles with a nylon-tipped pen. I asked him once if it wasn\u0027t more difficult that way. \"Otherwise there is no pride in it, Mr. Scudder,\" he\u0027d said.\n What he said now was that I\u0027d had no calls. I went upstairs and walked down the hall to my room. I checked to see if there was any light coming from under the door, and there wasn\u0027t, and I decided that that didn\u0027t prove anything. Then I looked for scratch marks around the lock, and there weren\u0027t any, and I decided that that didn\u0027t prove anything either, because you could pick those hotel locks with dental floss. Then I opened the door and found there was nothing in the room but the furniture, which stood to reason, and I turned on the light and closed and locked the door and held my hands at arm\u0027s length and watched the fingers tremble.\n I made myself a stiff drink and then I made myself drink it. For a moment or two my stomach picked up the shakes from my hands and I didn\u0027t think the whiskey was going to stay down, but it did. I wrote some letters and numbers on a piece of paper and put it in my wallet. I got out of my clothes and stood under the shower to wash off a coating of sweat. The worst sort of sweat, composed of equal parts of exertion and animal fear. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-10.html","bookId":2321,"book":{"id":2321,"title":"Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2) \n Small-time stoolie, Jake \"The Spinner\" Jablon, made a lot of new enemies when he switched careers, from informer to blackmailer.
