{"id":97292,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"I had been telling Birnbaum the truth. I had a hunch, and the more I thought about it the more I believed in it, and at the same time I kept wanting to be wrong. So I sat around the station house and read newspapers and drank endless cups of weak coffee and tried not to think about all of the things I couldn\u0027t possibly avoid thinking about. Somewhere along the line Birnbaum went home, after he\u0027d briefed another detective named Guzik, and around nine thirty Guzik came over to me and said they had a make from Washington. He read it off the teletype sheet. \"Lundgren, John Michael. Date of birth fourteen March \u0027forty-three. Place of birth San Bernardino, California. Whole trail of arrests here, Matt. Living off immoral earnings, assault, assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft auto, grand larceny. He did local bits all up and down the West Coast, pulled some hard time in Quentin.\" \"He pulled a one-to-five in Folsom,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know whether they called it extortion or larceny. That would have been fairly recent.\" He looked up at me. \"I thought you didn\u0027t know him.\" \"I don\u0027t. He was working a badger game. Arrested in San Diego, and his partner turned state\u0027s evidence and got off. Sentence suspended.\" \"That\u0027s more detail than I\u0027ve got here.\" I asked him if he had a cigarette. He said he didn\u0027t smoke. He turned to ask if anybody had a cigarette, but I told him to forget it. \"Get somebody with a steno pad,\" I said. \"There\u0027s a lot to tell.\" I gave them everything I could think of. How Beverly Ethridge had worked her way in and out of the world of crime. How she had married well and turned herself back into the society type she had been in the first place. How Spinner Jablon had pieced it all together on the strength of a newspaper photo and turned it into a neat little blackmail operation. \"I guess she stalled him for a while,\" I said. \"But it kept being expensive, and he kept pushing for bigger money. Then her old boyfriend Lundgren came east and showed her a way out. Why pay blackmail when it\u0027s so much easier to kill the blackmailer? Lundgren was a pro as a criminal but an amateur as a killer. He tried a couple of different methods on Spinner. Tried to get him with a car, then wound up hitting him over the head and putting him in the East River. Then he tried for me with the car.\" \"And then with the knife.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"How did you get into it?\" I explained, leaving out the names of Spinner\u0027s other blackmail victims. They didn\u0027t like that much, but there wasn\u0027t anything much they could do about it. I told them how I had staked myself out as a target and how Lundgren had taken the bait. Guzik kept interrupting to tell me I should have given everything to the cops right off, and I kept telling him it was something I had not been willing to do. \"We\u0027d\u0027ve handled it right, Matt. Jesus, you talk about Lundgren\u0027s an amateur, shit, you ran around like an amateur yourself and almost got your ass in the wringer. You wound up going up against a knife with nothing but your hands, and it\u0027s dumb luck you\u0027re alive this minute. The hell, you ought to know better, you were a cop fifteen years, and you act like you don\u0027t know what the department\u0027s all about.\" \"How about the people who didn\u0027t kill Spinner? What happens to them if I hand you the whole thing right off the bat?\" \"That\u0027s their lookout, isn\u0027t it? They come into it with dirty hands. They got something to hide, that shouldn\u0027t be getting in the way of a murder investigation.\" \"But there was no investigation. Nobody gave a shit about Spinner.\" \"Because you were withholding evidence.\" I shook my head. \"That\u0027s horseshit,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t have evidence that anybody killed Spinner. I had evidence that he was blackmailing several people. That was evidence against Spinner, but he was dead, and I didn\u0027t think you were particularly anxious to take him out of the morgue and throw him in a cell. The minute I had murder evidence I put it in your hand. Look, we could argue all day. Why don\u0027t you put out a pickup order on Beverly Ethridge?\" \"And charge her with what?\" \"Two counts of conspiracy to murder.\" \"You\u0027ve got the blackmail evidence?\" \"In a safe place. A safe-deposit box. I can bring it here in an hour.\" \"I think I\u0027ll come along with you and get it.\" I looked at him. \"Maybe I want to see just what\u0027s in the envelope, Scudder.\" It had been Matt up until then. I wondered what kind of a number he wanted to run. Maybe he was just fishing, but he had visions of something or other. Maybe he wanted to take my place in the blackmail dodge, only he\u0027d want real money, not the name of a murderer. Maybe he figured the other pigeons had committed real crimes and he could buy himself a commendation by knocking them off. I didn\u0027t know him well enough to guess which motivation would be consistent with the man, but it didn\u0027t really make very much difference. \"I don\u0027t get it,\" I said. \"I give you a homicide collar on a silver platter and you want to melt down the platter.\" \"I\u0027m sending a couple boys over to pick up Ethridge. In the meantime, you and me are going to open up a safe-deposit box.\" \"I could forget where I left the key.\" \"And I could make your life difficult.\" \"It\u0027s not that much of a cinch as it is. It\u0027s just a few blocks from here.\" \"Still raining,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll take a car.\" WE drove over to the Manufacturers Hanover branch at Fifty-seventh and Eighth. He left the black-and-white in a bus stop. All that to save a three-block walk, and it wasn\u0027t raining all that hard any more. We went inside and went down the stairs to the vault, and I gave my key to the guard and signed the signature card. \"Had the damnedest thing you ever heard of a few months back,\" Guzik said. He was friendly now that I was going along with him. \"This girl rented a box over at Chemical Bank, and she paid her eight bucks for a year, and she was visiting the box three or four times a day. Always with a guy, always a different guy. So the bank got suspicious and asked us to check it out, and wouldn\u0027t you know, the chick is a pross. Instead of taking a hotel room for ten bucks, she\u0027s picking up her tricks on the street and taking them to the fucking bank, for Christ\u0027s sake. Then she gets her box out and they show her to the little room, and she locks the door and gives the guy a quick blow job in complete privacy, and then she sticks the money in the box and locks it up again. And all it runs her is eight bucks for the year instead of ten bucks a trick, and it\u0027s safer than a hotel because if she gets a crazy he\u0027s not going to try beating her up in the middle of a fucking bank, is he? She can\u0027t get beaten up and she can\u0027t get robbed, and it\u0027s perfect.\" By this time the guard had used his key and mine to get the box from the vault. He handed it to me and led us to a cubicle. We entered together, and Guzik closed and locked the door. The room struck me as rather cramped for sex, but I understand people do it in airplane lavatories, and this was spacious in comparison. I asked Guzik what had happened to the girl. \"Oh, we told the bank not to press charges, or all it would do was give every streetwalker in the business the same idea. We told them to refund her box-rental fee and tell her they didn\u0027t want her business, so I guess that\u0027s what they did. She probably walked across the street and started doing business with another bank.\" \"But you never got any more complaints.\" \"No. Maybe she\u0027s got a friend at Chase Manhattan.\" He laughed hard at his own line, then chopped it off abruptly. \"Let\u0027s see what\u0027s in the box, Scudder.\" I handed it to him. \"Open it yourself,\" I said. He did, and I watched his face while he looked through everything. He had some interesting comments on the pictures he saw, and he gave the written material a fairly careful reading. Then he looked up suddenly. \"This is all the stuff on the Ethridge dame.\" \"Seems that way,\" I said. \"What about the others?\u0027 \" \"I guess these safe-deposit vaults aren\u0027t as foolproof as they\u0027re supposed to be. Somebody must have come in and taken everything else.\" \"You son of a bitch.\" \"You\u0027ve got everything you need, Guzik. No more and no less.\" \"You took a different box for each one. How many others are there?\" \"What difference does it make?\" \"You son of a bitch. So we\u0027ll walk back and ask the guard how many other boxes you have here, and we\u0027ll take a look at all of them.\" \"If you want. I can save you a little time.\" \"Oh?\" \"Not just three different boxes, Guzik. Three different banks. And don\u0027t even think about shaking me for the other keys, or running a check on the banks, or anything else you might have in mind. In fact, it might be a good idea if you stopped calling me a son of a bitch, because I might get unhappy, and I might decide not to cooperate in your investigation. I don\u0027t have to cooperate, you know. And if I don\u0027t, your case goes down the drain. You can possibly tie Ethridge to Lundgren without me, but you\u0027ll have a hell of a time finding anything a D.A. is going to want to take to court.\" We looked at each other for a while. A couple of times he started to say something, and a couple of times he figured out that it wasn\u0027t a particularly good idea. Finally something changed in his face, and I knew he\u0027d decided to let it go. He had enough, and he had all he was going to get, and his face said he knew it. \"The hell,\" he said, \"it\u0027s the cop in me, I want to get to the bottom of things. No offense, I hope.\" \"None at all,\" I said. I don\u0027t suppose I sounded very convincing. \"They probably hauled Ethridge out of bed by now. I\u0027ll get back and see what she\u0027s got to say. It should make good listening. Or maybe they didn\u0027t haul her out of bed. These pictures, you\u0027d have more fun hauling her into bed than out. Ever get any of that, Scudder?\" \"No.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t mind a taste myself. Want to come back to the station house with me?\" I didn\u0027t want to go anywhere with him. I didn\u0027t want to see Beverly Ethridge. \"I\u0027ll pass,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got an appointment.\" Chapter 17 I spent half an hour under the shower with the spray as hot as I could stand it. It had been a long night, and the only sleep I\u0027d had had been when I dozed off briefly in Birnbaum\u0027s chair. I had come close to being killed, and I had killed the man who\u0027d been trying for me. The Marlboro man, John Michael Lundgren. He\u0027d have been thirty-one next month. I would have guessed him at younger than that, twenty-six or so. Of course, I\u0027d never seen him in particularly good light. It didn\u0027t bother me that he was dead. He had been trying to kill me and had seemed pleased at the prospect. He had killed Spinner, and it wasn\u0027t unlikely that he\u0027d killed other people before. He might not have been a pro at killing, but it seemed to be something he enjoyed. He certainly liked working with the knife, and the boys who like to use knives usually get a sexual thrill out of their weaponry. Edged weapons are even more phallic that guns. I wondered if he\u0027d used a knife on Spinner. It wasn\u0027t inconceivable. The Medical Examiner\u0027s office doesn\u0027t catch everything. There was a case a while ago, a then-unidentified floater they fished out of the Hudson, and she was processed and buried without anyone\u0027s noticing that there was a bullet in her skull. They found out only because some yoyo severed her head before burial. He wanted the skull for a desk ornament, and ultimately they found the bullet and identified the skull from dental records and found out the woman had been missing from her home in Jersey for a couple of months.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-18.html","bookId":2321,"book":{"id":2321,"title":"Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2)","description":"Storyline: Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2) Small-time stoolie, Jake \"The Spinner\" Jablon, made a lot of new enemies when he switched careers, from informer to blackmailer.
