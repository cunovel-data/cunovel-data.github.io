{"id":97287,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Then she started to scream.\\n\\n Chapter 12\\n\\n If Shari hadn\u0027t known my name, I might have left. Perhaps not; cop instincts die hard if they die at all, and I had spent too many years despising those reluctant witnesses who slipped off into the shadows to feel comfortable playing the role myself. Nor would it have sat well to duck out on a girl in her condition.\\n\\n But the impulse was surely present. I looked at Henry Prager, his body slumped over his desk, his features contorted in death, and I knew that I was looking at a man I had killed. His finger had pulled the trigger, but I\u0027d put the gun in his hand by playing my game a little too well.\\n\\n I had not asked to have his life intertwined with mine, nor had I sought to be a factor in his death. Now his corpse confronted me; one hand was stretched across the desk, as if pointing at me.\\n\\n He had bribed his daughter\u0027s way out of an unintentional homicide. The bribery had laid him open to blackmail, which had provoked another homicide, this one intentional. And that first murder had only sunk the barb deeper-he was still being blackmailed, and he could always be tagged for Spinner\u0027s murder.\\n\\n And so he had tried to murder again, and had failed. And I turned up in his office the next day, and so he told his secretary he wanted five minutes, but he\u0027d taken only two or three of them.\\n\\n He\u0027d had the gun at hand. Perhaps he\u0027d checked it earlier in the day to make sure it was loaded. And perhaps, while I waited in the outer office, he entertained thoughts of greeting me with a bullet.\\n\\n But it is one thing to run a man down on a dark street at night or to knock a man unconscious and throw him in the river. And it is something else again to shoot a man in your own office with your secretary a few yards away. Perhaps he had measured out these considerations in his mind. Perhaps he had already resolved on suicide. I couldn\u0027t ask him now, and what did it matter? Suicide protected his daughter, while murder would have exposed everything. Suicide got him off a treadmill that turned faster than his legs could travel.\\n\\n I had some of these thoughts as I stood there regarding his corpse, others in the hours that followed. I don\u0027t know how long I looked at him while Shari sobbed against my shoulder. Not all that long, I suppose. Then reflexes took over, and I steered the girl back to the outer office and made her sit on the couch. I picked up her phone and dialed 911.\\n\\n THE crew that caught it was from the Seventeenth Precinct over on East Fifty-first. The two detectives were Jim Heaney and a younger man named Finch-I didn\u0027t catch his first name. I had known Jim enough to nod to, and that made it a little easier, but even with total strangers I didn\u0027t look to be in for much trouble. Everything added up to suicide to begin with, and the girl and I could both confirm that Prager was all alone when the gun went off.\\n\\n The lab boys went through the motions all the same, although their hearts weren\u0027t in it. They took a lot of pictures and made a lot of chalk marks, wrapped and bagged the gun, and finally zipped Prager into a body bag and got him out of there. Heaney and Finch took Shari\u0027s statement first so that she could go home and collapse on her own time. All they really wanted was for her to plug the standard gaps so that the coroner\u0027s inquest could return a verdict of suicide, so they fed her questions and confirmed that her boss had been depressed and edgy lately, that he had been evidently worried about business, that his moods had been abnormal and out of character, and, on the mechanical side, that she had seen him a few minutes before the shot sounded, that she and I had been sitting in the outer office at the time, and that we had entered simultaneously to find him dead in his chair.\\n\\n Heaney told her that was fine. Someone would be around for a formal statement in the morning, and in the meantime Detective Finch would see her home. She said that wasn\u0027t necessary, she\u0027d get a cab, but Finch insisted.\\n\\n Heaney watched the two of them leave. \"You bet Finch\u0027ll take her home,\" he said. \"That\u0027s quite an ass on that little lady.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t notice.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting old. Finch noticed. He likes the black ones, especially built like that. Myself, I don\u0027t fool around, but I got to admit I get a kick out of working with Finch. If he gets half the ass he tells me about, he\u0027s gonna fuck himself to death. Tell you the truth, I don\u0027t think he makes any of it up, either. The broads go for him.\" He lit a cigarette and offered the pack to me. I passed. He said, \"That girl now, Shari, I\u0027ll give you odds he nails her.\"\\n\\n \"Not today he won\u0027t. She\u0027s pretty shaky.\"\\n\\n \"Hell, that\u0027s the best time. I don\u0027t know what the hell it is, but that\u0027s when they want it the most. Go tell a woman her husband got killed, like breaking the news, now would you make a pass at a time like that? Whatever she looks like, would you do it? Neither would I. You should hear the stories that son of a bitch tells. Couple of months ago we had this ironworker falls off a girder, Finch has to break the news to the wife. He tells her, she cracks up, he gives her a hug to comfort her, pets her a little, and the next thing he knows she\u0027s got his zipper down and she\u0027s blowing him.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s if you take Finch\u0027s word for it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if half what he says is true, and I think he\u0027s straight about it. I mean, he tells me when he strikes out, too.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t much want to have this conversation, but neither did I want to make my feelings obvious, so we went through a few more stories of Finch\u0027s love life and then wasted a few minutes reviewing mutual friends. This might have taken longer had we known each other better. Finally he picked up his clipboard and concentrated on Prager. We went through the automatic questions, and I confirmed what Shari had told him.\\n\\n Then he said, \"Just for the record, any chance he could\u0027ve been dead before you got here?\" When I looked blank, he spelled it out. \"This is off the wall, but just for the record. Suppose she killed him, don\u0027t ask me how or why, and then she waits for you or somebody else to come in, and then she fakes talking to him, and she\u0027s sitting with you, and she triggers a gun, I don\u0027t know, a thread or something, and then the two of you discover the body together and she\u0027s covered.\"\\n\\n \"You better cut out all that television, Jim. It\u0027s affecting your brain.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it could happen that way.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I heard him talking to her when she went inside. Of course, she could have set up a tape recorder-\"\\n\\n \"All right, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"If you want to explore all the possibilities-\"\\n\\n \"I said it was just off the wall. You watch what they do on Mission Impossible and you wonder how criminals are so stupid in real life. So what the hell, a crook can watch television too, and maybe he picks up an idea. But you heard him talking, and we can forget tape recorders, and that settles that.\"\\n\\n Actually, I hadn\u0027t heard Prager talking, but it was a lot simpler to say that I had. Heaney wanted to explore possibilities; all I wanted to do was get out of there.\\n\\n \"How do you fit into this, Matt? You working for him?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Checking out some references.\"\\n\\n \"Checking on Prager?\"\\n\\n \"No. On somebody who used him for a reference, and my client wanted a fairly intensive check. I saw Prager last week and I was in the neighborhood so I dropped in to clear up a couple of points.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s the subject of the investigation?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the difference? Somebody who worked with him eight or ten years ago. Nothing to do with him knocking himself off.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t really know him, then. Prager.\"\\n\\n \"Met him twice. Once, come to think of it, since I didn\u0027t really get to see much of him today. And I talked briefly with him on the phone.\"\\n\\n \"He in some kind of trouble?\"\\n\\n \"Not any more. I can\u0027t tell you much, Jim. I didn\u0027t know the guy or much about his situation. He seemed depressed and agitated. As a matter of fact, he impressed me as thinking the world was after him. He was very suspicious the first time I saw him, as if I was part of a plot to harm him.\"\\n\\n \"Paranoia.\"\\n\\n \"Like that, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, it all fits together. Business troubles and the feeling everything\u0027s closing in on you, and maybe he thought you were going to hassle him today, or maybe he reached a point, you know, he\u0027s had it up to here and he just can\u0027t stand to see one more person. So he takes the gun out of the drawer and there\u0027s a bullet in his brain before he has time to think it over. I wish to God they\u0027d keep those handguns off the market. They truck \u0027em in by the ton out of the Carolinas. What do you bet that was an unregistered gun?\"\\n\\n \"No bet.\"\\n\\n \"He probably thought he was buying it for protection. Little rinky-dink Spanish gun, you could hit a mugger six times in the chest and not stop him, and all it\u0027s good for is blowing your brains out. Had a guy about a year ago, it wasn\u0027t even good for that. Decided to kill himself and only did half the job and he\u0027s a vegetable now. Now he oughta kill himself, the life he\u0027s got left to him, but he can\u0027t even move his hands.\" He lit another cigarette. \"You want to drop around tomorrow and dictate a statement?\"\\n\\n I told him I could do better than that. I used Shari\u0027s typewriter and knocked out a short statement with all the facts in the right places. He read it over and nodded. \"You know the form,\" he said. \"Saves us all some time.\"\\n\\n I signed what I\u0027d typed up, and he added it to the papers on his clipboard. He shuffled through them and said, \"His wife\u0027s where? Westchester. Thank Christ for that. I\u0027ll phone the cops up there and let them have the fun of telling her her husband\u0027s dead.\"\\n\\n I caught myself just in time to keep from volunteering the information that Prager had a daughter in Manhattan. It wasn\u0027t something I was likely to know. We shook hands, and he said he wished Finch would get back. \"The bastard scored again,\" he said. \"He figured to. Just so he don\u0027t stick around for seconds. And he might. He really likes the spades.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll tell you all about it.\"\\n\\n \"He always does.\"\\n\\n Chapter 13\\n\\n I went to a bar, but stayed only long enough to throw down two double shots, one right after the other. There was a time factor involved. Bars remain open until four in the morning, but most churches close up shop by six or seven. I walked over to Lexington and found a church I couldn\u0027t remember having been to before. I didn\u0027t notice the name of it. Our Lady of Perpetual Bingo, probably.\\n\\n They were having some sort of service, but I didn\u0027t pay any attention to it. I lit a few candles and stuffed a couple of dollars in the slot, then took a seat in the rear and silently repeated three names over and over. Jacob Jablon, Henry Prager, Estrellita Rivera, three names, three candles for three corpses.\\n\\n During the worst times after I shot and killed Estrellita Rivera, I had been unable to keep my mind from going over and over what had happened that night. I kept trying to repeal time and change the ending, like an antic projectionist reversing the film and drawing the bullet back into the barrel of the gun. In the new version that I wanted to superimpose on reality, all my shots were on target. There were no ricochets, or if there were they spent themselves harmlessly, or Estrellita spent an extra minute picking out peppermints in the candy store and wasn\u0027t in the wrong place at the wrong time, or-\\n\\n There was a poem I\u0027d had to read in high school, and it had nagged at me from somewhere in the back of my mind until one day I went to the library and ran it down.
