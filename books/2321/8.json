{"id":97282,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"Well, we can find a use for it,\" she said. \"Thanks. Do you want to talk to the boys?\" I did and I didn\u0027t. They\u0027re getting to an age where it\u0027s a little easier for me to talk to them, but it\u0027s still awkward over the phone. We talked about basketball. Right after I hung up, I had an odd thought. It occurred to me that I might not be talking to them again. Spinner had been a careful man by nature, a man who had made himself inconspicuous reflexively, a man who had felt most comfortable in deep shadows, and he still had not been careful enough. I was accustomed to open spaces, and in fact had to stay enough in the open to invite a murder attempt. If Spinner\u0027s killer decided to take a shot at me, he just might make it work. I wanted to call back and talk to them again. It seemed that there ought to be something important for me to say, just on the off chance that I\u0027d taken on more than I could carry. But I couldn\u0027t manage to think what it might be, and a few minutes later the impulse went away. I had a lot to drink that night. It was just as well no one took a crack at me then. I\u0027d have been easy. MONDAY morning I called Prager. I\u0027d left him on a very loose leash, and I had to give it a yank. His secretary told me he was busy on another line and asked if I would hold. I held for a minute or two. Then she came back to establish that I was still hanging in there, and then she put me through to him. I said, \"I\u0027ve decided how we\u0027ll work this so that you\u0027re covered. There\u0027s something the police tried to hang on me that they could never make stick.\" He didn\u0027t know I\u0027d been a cop myself. \"I can write out a confession, include enough evidence to make it airtight. I\u0027ll give that to you as part of our deal.\" It was basically the arrangement I\u0027d tried out on Beverly Ethridge, and it made the same kind of sense to him that it had to her. Neither of them had managed to spot the joker in it, either: All I had to do was confess at great length to a crime that had never happened, and while my confession might make interesting reading, it would hardly enable anyone to hold a gun to my head. But Prager didn\u0027t figure out that part of it, so he liked the idea. What he didn\u0027t like was the price I set. \"That\u0027s impossible,\" he said. \"It\u0027s easier than paying it in bits and pieces. You were paying Jablon two thousand a month. You\u0027ll pay me sixty in one chunk, that\u0027s less than three years\u0027 worth, and it\u0027ll all be over once and for all.\" \"I can\u0027t raise that kind of money.\" \"You\u0027ll find a way, Prager.\" \"I can\u0027t manage it.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" I said. \"You\u0027re an important man in your field, a success. If you don\u0027t have it in cash, you certainly have assets you can borrow against.\" \"I can\u0027t do it.\" His voice almost broke. \"I\u0027ve hadâ€¦ financial difficulties. Some investments haven\u0027t turned out to be what they should have been. The economy, there\u0027s less building, the interest rates are going crazy, just last week somebody raised the prime rate to ten percent-\" \"I don\u0027t want an economics lesson, Mr. Prager. I want sixty thousand dollars.\" \"I\u0027ve borrowed every cent I could.\" He paused for a moment. \"I can\u0027t, I have no source-\" \"I\u0027ll need the money fairly soon,\" I cut in. \"I don\u0027t want to stay in New York any longer than I have to.\" \"I don\u0027t-\" \"You do some creative thinking,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be in touch with you.\" I hung up and sat in the phone booth for a minute or two, until someone waiting to use it gave an impatient knock on the door. I opened the door and stood up. The man who wanted to use the phone looked as though he was going to say something, but he looked at me and changed his mind. I wasn\u0027t enjoying myself. I was putting Prager through a wringer. If he\u0027d killed Spinner, then maybe he had it coming. But if he hadn\u0027t, I was torturing him to no purpose, and the thought did not set well with me. But one thing had come out of the conversation: He was hurting for money. And if Spinner, too, had been pushing for the fast final settlement, the big bite so that he could get out of town before someone killed him, that might have been enough to put the last bit of pressure on Henry Prager. I\u0027d been on the verge of ruling him out when I saw him in his office. I just didn\u0027t see that he had enough of a motive, but now he seemed to have a pretty good one after all. And I\u0027d just given him another. I called Huysendahl a little later. He was out, so I left my number, and he called around two. \"I know I wasn\u0027t supposed to call you,\" I said, \"but I have some good news for you.\" \"Oh?\" \"I\u0027m in a position to claim my reward.\" \"You managed to turn up that material?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Very quick work,\" he said. \"Oh, just sound detective procedure and a little bit of luck.\" \"I see. It may take some time to, uh, assemble the reward.\" \"I don\u0027t have very much time, Mr. Huysendahl.\" \"You have to be reasonable about this, you know. The sum we discussed is substantial.\" \"I understand you have substantial assets.\" \"Yes, but hardly in cash. Not every politician has a friend in Florida with that kind of money in a wall safe.\" He chuckled over the line, and seemed disappointed when I didn\u0027t join in. \"I\u0027ll need some time.\" \"How much time?\" \"A month at the outside. Perhaps less than that.\" The role was easy enough, since I kept getting to rehearse it. I said, \"That\u0027s not soon enough.\" \"Really? Just how much of a hurry are you in?\" \"A big one. I want to get out of town. The climate doesn\u0027t agree with me.\" \"Actually, it\u0027s been rather mild the past few days.\" \"That\u0027s just the trouble. It\u0027s too hot.\" \"Oh?\" \"I keep thinking about what happened to our mutual friend, and I wouldn\u0027t want it to happen to me.\" \"He must have made someone unhappy.\" \"Yeah, well, I\u0027ve made a few people unhappy myself, Mr. Huysendahl, and what I want to do is get the hell out of here within the week.\" \"I don\u0027t see how that would be possible.\" He paused for a moment. \"You could always go and come back for the reward when things have had a chance to cool down somewhat.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d like to do it that way.\" \"That\u0027s rather an alarming statement, don\u0027t you think? The sort of venture we\u0027ve discussed requires a certain amount of give-and-take. It has to be a cooperative venture.\" \"A month is just too long.\" \"I might be able to manage it in two weeks.\" \"You might have to,\" I said. \"That sounds disturbingly like a threat,\" \"The thing is, you\u0027re not the only person furnishing a reward.\" \"I\u0027m not surprised.\" \"Right. And if I have to leave town before I can collect the reward from you, well, you never know what might happen.\" \"Don\u0027t be foolish, Scudder.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be. I don\u0027t think either of us should be foolish.\" I took a breath. \"Look, Mr. Huysendahl, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing we can\u0027t work out.\" \"I certainly hope you\u0027re right.\" \"How does two weeks sound to you?\" \"Difficult.\" \"Can you manage it?\" \"I can try. I hope I can manage it.\" \"So do I. You know how to reach me.\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"I know how to reach you.\" I hung the phone up and poured a drink. Just a small one. I drank half of it and nursed the rest of it. The phone rang. I tossed down the last of the bourbon and picked it up. I thought it would be Prager. It was Beverly Ethridge. She said, \"Matt, it\u0027s Bev. I hope I didn\u0027t wake you?\" \"You didn\u0027t.\" \"Are you alone?\" \"Yes. Why?\" \"I\u0027m lonesome.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. I remembered sitting across the table from her, making it obvious that she wasn\u0027t getting to me. The performance had evidently convinced her. But I knew better. The woman was good at getting to people. \"I hoped we could get together, Matt. There are things we ought to talk about.\" \"All right.\" \"Would you be free around seven this evening? I\u0027ve appointments until then.\" \"Seven\u0027s fine.\" \"The same place?\" I remembered how I had felt in the Pierre. This time we would meet on my turf. But not Armstrong\u0027s; I didn\u0027t want to take her there. \"There\u0027s a place called Polly\u0027s Cage,\" I said. \"Fifty-seventh between Eighth and Ninth, middle of the block, the downtown side.\" \"Polly\u0027s Cage? It sounds charming.\" \"It\u0027s better than it sounds.\" \"Then I\u0027ll see you there at seven. Fifty-seventh between Eighth and Ninth-that\u0027s very near your hotel, isn\u0027t it?\" \"It\u0027s across the street.\" \"That\u0027s very convenient,\" she said. \"It\u0027s handy for me.\" \"It might be handy for both of us, Matt.\" I went out and had a couple of drinks and something to eat. Around six I got back to my hotel. I checked with the desk, and Benny told me I\u0027d had three calls and there had been no messages. I wasn\u0027t in my room ten minutes before the phone rang. I picked it up, and a voice I didn\u0027t recognize said, \"Scudder?\" \"Who\u0027s this?\" \"You ought to be very careful. You go off halfcocked and upset people.\" \"I don\u0027t think I know you.\" \"You don\u0027t want to know me. All you gotta know is it\u0027s a big river, plenty of room in it, you don\u0027t want to try and fill it up all by yourself.\" \"Who wrote that line for you, anyway?\" The phone clicked. Chapter 9 I got to Polly\u0027s a few minutes early. There were four men and two women drinking at the bar. Behind it, Chuck was laughing politely at something one of the women had said. On the jukebox Sinatra was asking them to send in the clowns. The room is a small one, with the bar on the right side as you enter. A railing runs the length of the room, and on the left of it there is an area a few steps up that contains about a dozen tables. They were all unoccupied now. I walked to the break in the railing, climbed the steps, and took the table that was farthest from the door. Polly\u0027s gets most of its play around five, when thirsty people leave their offices. The really thirsty ones stick around longer than the rest, but the place doesn\u0027t pick up much passer-by trade, and almost always closes fairly early. Chuck pours generous drinks, and the five o\u0027clock drinkers usually tap out early on. On Fridays the TGIF crowd shows a certain amount of perseverance, but other times they generally lock up by midnight, and they don\u0027t even bother opening up on Saturdays or Sundays. It\u0027s a bar in the neighborhood without being a neighborhood bar. I ordered a double bourbon, and had put half of it away by the time she walked in. She hesitated in the doorway, not seeing me at first, and some conversations died as heads turned her way. She seemed unaware of the attention she was drawing, or too accustomed to it to take notice of it. She spotted me, came over, and sat opposite me. The bar conversations resumed once it was established that she wasn\u0027t up for grabs. She slid her coat off her shoulders and onto the back of her chair. She was wearing a hot-pink sweater. It was a good color for her, and an excellent fit. She took a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from her handbag. This time she didn\u0027t wait for me to light her cigarette. She drew in a lot of smoke, blew it out in a thin column, and watched with evident interest as it ascended toward the ceiling.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-8.html","bookId":2321,"book":{"id":2321,"title":"Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2)","description":"Storyline: Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2) Small-time stoolie, Jake \"The Spinner\" Jablon, made a lot of new enemies when he switched careers, from informer to blackmailer.
