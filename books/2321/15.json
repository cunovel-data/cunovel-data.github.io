{"id":97289,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"In my room I checked through the Times. Prager was on the obit page under a two-column headline. Just his obituary, with the statement that he had died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. It was apparent, all right. I was not mentioned in the article. I\u0027d thought that was how his daughter might have gotten my name. Then I looked at the message slip again. She had called around nine the night before, and the first edition of the Times wouldn\u0027t have hit the street before eleven or twelve.\\n\\n So that meant she\u0027d learned my name from the police. Or that she had heard it earlier, from her father.\\n\\n I picked up the phone, then put it down again. I did not much want to talk to Stacy Prager. I couldn\u0027t imagine that there was anything I wanted to hear from her, and I knew there was nothing I wanted to say to her. The fact that her father was a murderer was not something she would learn from me, nor would anyone else. Spinner Jablon had had the revenge he\u0027d purchased from me. So far as the rest of the world was concerned, his case could remain in the Open file forever. The police didn\u0027t care who had killed him, and I didn\u0027t feel obliged to tell them.\\n\\n I picked up the phone again and called Beverly Ethridge. The line was busy. I broke the connection and tried Huysendahl\u0027s office. He was out to lunch. I waited a few minutes and tried the Ethridge number again, and it was still busy. I stretched out on the bed and closed my eyes, and the phone rang.\\n\\n \"Mr. Scudder? My name is Stacy Prager.\" A young and earnest voice. \"I\u0027m sorry I haven\u0027t been in. After I called last night I wound up taking the train so I could be with my mother.\"\\n\\n \"I just got your message a few minutes ago.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Well, would it be possible for me to talk with you? I\u0027m at Grand Central, I could come to your hotel or meet you wherever you say.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure how I could help you.\"\\n\\n There was a pause. Then she said, \"Maybe you can\u0027t. I don\u0027t know. But you were the last person to see my father alive, and I-\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t even see him yesterday, Miss Prager. I was waiting to see him at the time it happened.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s right. But the thing is… listen, I\u0027d really like to meet with you, if that\u0027s all right.\"\\n\\n \"If there\u0027s anything I could help you with over the telephone-\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t I meet you?\"\\n\\n I asked her if she knew where my hotel was. She said she did, and that she could be there in ten or twenty minutes and she would phone me from the lobby. I hung up and wondered how she had known how to reach me. I\u0027m not in the telephone book. And I wondered if she\u0027d known about Spinner Jablon, and if she\u0027d known about me. If the Marlboro man was her boyfriend, and if she\u0027d been in on the planning…\\n\\n If so, it was logical to believe that she\u0027d hold me responsible for her father\u0027s death. I couldn\u0027t even argue the point-I felt responsible myself. But I couldn\u0027t really believe she\u0027d have a cute little gun in her handbag. I\u0027d ragged Heaney about watching television. I don\u0027t watch all that much television myself.\\n\\n It took her fifteen minutes, during which time I tried Beverly Ethridge again and got another busy signal. Then Stacy called from the lobby, and I went downstairs to meet her.\\n\\n Long dark hair, straight, parted in the middle. A tall, slender girl with a long, narrow face and dark, bottomless eyes. She wore clean well-tailored blue jeans and a lime-green cardigan sweater over a simple white blouse. Her handbag had been made by cutting the legs off another pair of jeans. I decided it was highly unlikely there was a gun in it.\\n\\n We confirmed that I was Matthew Scudder and she was Stacy Prager. I suggested coffee, and we went to the Red Flame and took a booth. After they gave us the coffee, I told her I was very sorry about her father but that I still couldn\u0027t imagine why she wanted to see me.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why he killed himself,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Neither do I.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you?\" Her eyes searched my face. I tried to imagine her as she had been a few years ago, smoking grass and dropping pills, running down a child and freaking out sufficiently to drive away from what she\u0027d done. That image failed to jibe with the girl seated across the Formica table from me. She now seemed alert and aware and responsible, wounded by her father\u0027s death but strong enough to ride it out.\\n\\n She said, \"You\u0027re a detective.\"\\n\\n \"More or less.\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"I do some private work on a free-lance basis. None of it as interesting as it may sound.\"\\n\\n \"And you were working for my father?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I\u0027d seen him once last week,\" I said, and went on to repeat the cover story I\u0027d given Jim Heaney. \"So I really didn\u0027t know your father at all.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s very strange,\" she said.\\n\\n She stirred her coffee, added more sugar, stirred it again. She took a sip and put the cup back in the saucer. I asked her why it was strange.\\n\\n She said, \"I saw my father the night before last. He was waiting at my apartment when I got home from classes. He took me out for dinner. He does that-did that-once or twice a week. But usually he would call me first to arrange it. He said he just had the impulse and took the chance that I\u0027d be coming home.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"He was very upset. Is that the right word? He was agitated, he was unsettled about something. He was always inclined to be a moody man, very exuberant when things were going right, very depressed when they weren\u0027t. When I was first getting into Abnormal Psych and studied the manic-depressive syndrome I got tremendous echoes of my father. I don\u0027t mean that he was insane in any sense of the word, but that he had the same kind of mood swings. They didn\u0027t interfere with his life, it was just that he had that type of personality.\"\\n\\n \"And he was depressed the night before last?\"\\n\\n \"It was more than depression. It was a combination of depression and the kind of hyperactive nervousness you can get on speed. I would have thought he had taken some amphetamines except I know how he feels about drugs. I had a period of drug use a few years ago and he made it pretty clear how he felt, so I didn\u0027t really believe he was on anything.\"\\n\\n She drank some more coffee. No, there was no gun in her purse. This was a very open girl. If she had a gun she\u0027d have used it immediately.\\n\\n She said, \"We had dinner in a Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood. That\u0027s the Upper West Side, that\u0027s where I live. He hardly touched his food. I was very hungry myself, but I kept picking up his vibrations and I wound up not eating very much either. His conversation kept rambling all over the place. He was very concerned about me. He asked several times if I ever used drugs any more. I don\u0027t, and I told him so. He asked about my classes, if I was happy with my coursework and if I felt I was on the right track so far as how I would be earning a living. He asked if I was involved with anybody romantically, and I said I wasn\u0027t, nothing serious. And then he asked me if I knew you.\"\\n\\n \"He did?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I said the only Scudder I knew was the Scudder Falls Bridge. He asked if I had ever been to your hotel-he named the hotel and asked if I had been there-and I said I hadn\u0027t. He said that was where you lived. I didn\u0027t really understand what he was driving at.\"\\n\\n \"Neither do I.\"\\n\\n \"He asked if I ever saw a man spin a silver dollar. He took a quarter and spun it on the top of the table and asked if I had ever seen a man do that with a silver dollar. I said no, and I asked him if he was feeling all right. He said he was fine, and that it was very important that I shouldn\u0027t worry about him. He said if anything happened to him that I would be all right and not to worry.\"\\n\\n \"Which made you more concerned than ever.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. I was afraid… I was afraid of all kinds of things, and scared even to think of them. Like I thought he might have been to the doctor and found out there was something wrong with him. But I called the doctor he always goes to, I did that last night, and he hadn\u0027t been there since his annual physical last November, and there was nothing wrong with him then except slightly high blood pressure. Of course, maybe he went to some other doctor, there\u0027s no way of knowing unless it shows up in the autopsy. They have to do an autopsy in cases like this. Mr. Scudder?\"\\n\\n I looked at her.\\n\\n \"When they called me, when I found out he had killed himself, I wasn\u0027t surprised.\"\\n\\n \"You expected it?\"\\n\\n \"Not consciously. I didn\u0027t really expect it, but once I heard, it all seemed to fit. In some way or other, I guess I knew he was trying to tell me he was going to die, trying to tie off the ends before he did it. But I don\u0027t know why he did it. And then I heard that you were there when he did it, and I remembered his asking me about you, if I knew you, and I wondered how you fit into it all. I thought maybe there was some problem in his life and you were investigating it for him, because the policeman said you were a detective, and I wondered… I just don\u0027t understand what it was all about.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t imagine why he mentioned my name.\"\\n\\n \"You really weren\u0027t working for him?\"\\n\\n \"No, and I hadn\u0027t had very much contact with him, it was just a superficial matter of confirming another man\u0027s references.\"\\n\\n \"Then it doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n I considered. \"We did talk for a while last week,\" I said. \"I suppose it\u0027s possible something I said seemed to have a special impact on his thinking. I can\u0027t imagine what it might have been, but we had one of those rambling conversations, and he might have picked up on something without my noticing it.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose that would have to be the explanation.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t conceive of anything else.\"\\n\\n \"And then, whatever it was, it stayed on his mind. So he brought up your name because he couldn\u0027t bring himself to mention what it was that you said, or what it meant to him. And then when his secretary said you were there it must have sort of triggered things in his mind. Triggered. That\u0027s an interesting choice of word, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n It had triggered things, the girl\u0027s announcing my presence. There was no question about it.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t make anything out of the silver dollar. Unless it\u0027s the song. \u0027You can spin a silver dollar on a barroom floor and it\u0027ll roll because it\u0027s round.\u0027 What\u0027s the next line? Something about a woman never knows what a good man she has until she loses him, something like that. Maybe he meant he was losing everything now, I don\u0027t know. I guess his mind, I guess it wasn\u0027t terribly clear at the end.\"\\n\\n \"He must have been under a strain.\"\\n\\n \"I guess so.\" She looked away for a moment. \"Did he ever say anything to you about me?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n I pretended to concentrate, then said I was sure.\\n\\n \"I just hope he realized that everything\u0027s all right with me now. That\u0027s all. If he had to die, if he thought he had to die, I at least hope he knew I\u0027m okay.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he did.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d been going through a lot since they called her and told her. Longer than that: since that dinner at the Chinese place. And she was going through plenty now. But she wasn\u0027t going to cry. She wasn\u0027t a crier. She was a strong one. If he\u0027d had half her strength, he wouldn\u0027t have had to kill himself. He would have told Spinner to go screw himself in the first place, and he wouldn\u0027t have paid blackmail money, wouldn\u0027t have killed once, wouldn\u0027t have had to try to kill a second time. She was stronger than he had been. I don\u0027t know how much pride you can take in that kind of strength. You either have it or you don\u0027t. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-15.html","bookId":2321,"book":{"id":2321,"title":"Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2)","description":"Storyline: Time to Murder and Create (Matthew Scudder #2) \\n Small-time stoolie, Jake \"The Spinner\" Jablon, made a lot of new enemies when he switched careers, from informer to blackmailer.
