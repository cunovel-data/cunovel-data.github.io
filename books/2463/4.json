{"id":81257,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"BY STEPHEN R . BISSETTE\n \u0027I\u0027m home, always home.\u0027\n Copper stands rock-solid, squints at the noise from across the street.\n As usual, the cops didn\u0027t show until long after the action was over.\n Copper squints and spits over the railing.\n \u0027If you need a statement, you know where to find me.\u0027\n \u0027We won\u0027t be needing a statement, sir.\u0027\n Copper\u0027s eyes shift downward, to the young policeman\u0027s face. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s made eye contact with the kid.\n The policeman is a kid - hell, even I can tell he\u0027s barely out of the academy. I can see that from where I\u0027m looking out, three houses away.\n \u0027No questions, nothin\u0027 at all?\u0027\n Copper spits again, looks from the man in uniform doing nothing, to the men in uniform across the street, also doing nothing.\n \u0027This is the sixth house they\u0027ve gutted in this neighborhood. \u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir, we appreciate your calling it in.\u0027\n \u0027I seen it all and I called it in - twenty-six hours ago.\u0027\n Copper lets that one stand. He tilts his head, cocking his neck, staring the policeman down.\n \u0027I\u0027ve called in every goddamned one of \u0027em.\u0027\n I can see the white of the cop\u0027s scalp when he looks away from the old man\u0027s glare.\n The kid clears his throat and looks down, as if there were something of importance in his hand. He already closed his notebook. What can there be to look at? He doesn\u0027t even have calluses to gander at.\n \u0027City just doesn\u0027t care, does it?\u0027\n The kid\u0027s crew cut is too close, like a fresh military cut. His scalp gleams like a baby\u0027s knee. This kid is green, the type that needs a weekly trim and says so, as if that were part and parcel of being a cop, to make up for doing nothing.\n \u0027But come tax reassessment time, the city is right at my door.\u0027\n Of course they send him to talk to Copper.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got one question, officer.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that, Mr Cyrus?\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027re you going to do when they come after my house?\u0027\n If there is a reply, he doesn\u0027t stay long enough to hear it.\n The screen door slaps closed without a whisper from the hinges. Copper keeps everything shipshape; no squeaking door on his watch.\n It doesn\u0027t matter. The cop is on his heel and away, too. His polished shoes are too smart on the tarmac; the crease of his pantlegs are sharp as a paper cut.\n He shakes his head and mutters something I can\u0027t make out, and his cop cronies make some wisecrack back at him, and they all have a hearty laugh at Copper\u0027s expense.\n Anything to clear the air of the old man\u0027s comment, ignore the truth of it, pretend it wasn\u0027t said or heard or didn\u0027t matter.\n I lay low and watch the old man\u0027s porch.\n I dream of Mount McKinley.\n I dream of fucking, and climbing, and cold, and pain and cold.\n I dream of my dick splitting in half.\n I wake up on the bare cement floor in the basement of the Baker house.\n No pain.\n No cold.\n I hear Fetus moving around upstairs.\n I stand up. Go to the window.\n Still have to tell myself I\u0027m home.\n Home.\n My hometown didn\u0027t used to look like this.\n It\u0027s looking more like the east side of Baghdad every day. Damn near every house looted, gutted, no electricity, no running water.\n I look past the row of shells.\n Every house on this street is abandoned but one.\n It\u0027s the same for blocks.\n A neighborhood of shells.\n Windows boarded up, sheets of plywood over doorways, broken panes, sagging clapboards, chipping paint, ragged shingles.\n All but one.\n I see Copper across the way and up the street, sitting on his porch.\n Copper sits on his rocker on his porch.\n I remember I have something to do.\n \u0027So what you want from me?\u0027\n Copper sits on his rocker on his porch, still as a stump. One spot- flecked hand over his other wrist.\n It\u0027s an odd position, and he changes hands to cup the opposite wrist, if you are with him long enough to notice.\n Copper later tells me that\u0027s how the cold hits him: it stabs his wrists.\n His wrists get cold, a deep cold that starts slow before it bites to the marrow and lingers. \u0027Started when I was in my mid fifties,\u0027 he later says, \u0027and the damned thing is, it\u0027s same as when I was in Korea. Same cold, as if I\u0027d never left it. Like it followed me here.\u0027\n But that is later.\n Today, he sits with one hand over t\u0027other, over the wrist, and gazes at me with those milky blue eyes of his.\n \u0027You\u0027re here all the time,\u0027 I say. \u0027I see you keeping watch.\u0027\n He turns his head and spits without taking his hand off that wrist. Over the rail it goes, a shimmering clam arcing into the perfectly trimmed grass.\n \u0027Yep, I\u0027m home, always home. What of it?\u0027\n \u0027So, we\u0027re looking to start a neighborhood watch.\u0027\n His eyes don\u0027t so much as quiver.\n His lips are tight, white, top and bottom.\n \u0027Keep an eye on one another\u0027s houses, watch out for one another,\u0027 I offer.\n \u0027I\u0027m home.\u0027\n Another lunger over the rail, into the perfect green grass, somehow without breaking gaze with me.\n \u0027Always home.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027\n We let that hang in the air.\n We let it hang a while, let it slide to quiet and seep in, like his spit on the blade of grass below is hanging then seeping, though I can\u0027t say for sure it is or does, as I\u0027m watching Copper.\n Copper doesn\u0027t move a notch, and he won\u0027t.\n Up to me, since I\u0027m the one intruding, to break the silence.\n \u0027Since you keep an eye out, it seemed-\u0027\n Without breaking the gaze, another lunger, over the rail.\n Though his milky blues don\u0027t so much as shift, I can tell he\u0027s sizing me up - seeing if I break the stare to track his lunger, to see if it\u0027s green as the green-green St Patty\u0027s Day grass.\n Copper\u0027s lawn is perfect, always perfect, the only cut and green lawn on the block, and Copper\u0027s lungers won\u0027t change that a whit. His eyes stay icy, but I can tell he\u0027s a bit amused by all this.\n What they say, clear as crystal, is what he won\u0027t say.\n \u0027-you know, we watch out for one another.\u0027\n He says it later, just to clear the air.\n Later, when we get to know one another a bit, when we are in the basement waiting for T.\n Later, when he tells me about how the cold sunk its choppers into his wrists, about Korea, about \u0027Nam before it was \u0027Nam, about his wife Becca before she was gone, about his calico cat Hank before T took Hank down into the cellar and did the deed, before all that shit hit all those fans.\n He says later what his eyes say now loud and clear, and I hear just fine. He says it later just to make sure there are no hard feelings.\n What do I need you for? What do I need you to watch out for me or mine for? What could you possibly offer me that I don\u0027t already do or have done or was or am or will be?\n I\u0027m home, always home.\n Later, he says all that.\n Not now, not on the porch.\n Not today.\n He says, \u0027I remember you, kid.\u0027\n I look at him.\n \u0027You lived over on Spruce and James. Your mom raised you.\u0027\n Now, he just glares at me, giving up nothing.\n \u0027I remember you.\u0027\n Copper sits on his rocker.\n We just stay like this for a long, long time.\n From now to now, then to now.\n That\u0027s when I know Copper\u0027s our man.\n That\u0027s when I know we get along just fine.\n It\u0027s Fetus who suggests I pay the visit, take in the old man\u0027s mettle.\n It\u0027s Stout who says fuck that, who needs Copper.\n Stout grew up around the block from Copper and his wife Becca.\n Stout left for boot camp before the cancer took her. I left a week after.\n Stout and I were in Baghdad together. Good times. Bad times. OIF 1, the invasion, no food, one MRE per day, nothing too heavy, got to shoot back.\n Then Thunderdome.\n Ate Alaskan king crab every night for months at FOB Shield. Weird. Mayberry in the shit.\n Stout took fire; RPG in the pipeline between Kuwait and Iraq. HMMWV limped away with Stout in it.\n Stout lost an arm, part of his chest, but all that\u0027s left works. Home he went.\n Found him here, back home.\n Stout says fuck Copper.\n Stout has no use for the old man, never did, but that too changes that night in the basement.\n Stout wouldn\u0027t brook any ill word about the old lady.\n Becca babysat for him and his sister, back when they needed sitting.\n He speaks of it, once, only once.\n That I remember.\n Stout\u0027s smile bares his black broken teeth.\n It\u0027s an occasion whenever Stout smiles.\n I remember.\n Stout says the army promised him dental. That was before.\n The army didn\u0027t take care of dental or much else. The U.S. Army took Stout and took him and his and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be.\n The U.S. Army took him and left Stout to Stout and left Stout to us.\n Stout says fuck that, who needs the U.S. Army?\n Stout says fuck Copper, who needs the old man?\n Still, it\u0027s Fetus and me who reckon the old man is all right, that we need him.\n There\u0027s T.\n T drives by Copper\u0027s house.\n I see T drive by Copper\u0027s house.\n T doesn\u0027t turn to look at Copper.\n Copper doesn\u0027t look at T.\n T drives toward the Baker digs.\n T looks at the Baker house.\n T glares at the Baker house.\n I watch T drive away.\n I sit in the basement at the Baker house.\n I like it here in the basement.\n Safe. Like in Baghdad.\n We used to sandbag all the windows.\n It was dark, except for what light came in through the skylight.\n The Baker basement is dark. I like it fine.\n I miss the LED lights I used to strap to my head, but otherwise it\u0027s the same.\n No electricity. Dark. Sleep all day.\n Try to remember.\n Back in the day.\n I remember when Trapper and I signed up.\n I remember Trapper - T - I remember T.\n I remember T when they took his brother away.\n I remember T after that. T said the cops took him and his and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be. I remember T says that.\n I remember.\n I remember T when he grinned at me, after signing up, and I remember the look on the recruiter\u0027s face.\n Word is T never went over to the shit.\n Word is T was shipped right back here.\n Word is T got into some shit, and was kept from the shit.\n That\u0027s before they were taking anyone, anytime, with any record. Miller tells me that\u0027s how it is now. Two legs, two arms, two eyes, you in.\n Word is T got into some shit, they booted him before he saw sand.\n So T made like the Shia did over there - stripped and hauled anything worth anything away.\n Makes the neighborhood look like Baghdad East.\n Word is T has made a killing on the neighborhood.\n Word is T gutted the neighborhood.\n Shell by shell, T took all it was and sold it.\n That\u0027s before I got back, before Fetus came back.\n Fetus took three AK-47 rounds three hundred meters from the Alamo; he shouldn\u0027t have made it.\n He made it.\n Came back home.\n I remember Fetus before the shit.\n Fetus smoked those fucking French Gauloises, cheap tobacco the locals smoked over there.\n I remember Fetus before the war took his and him and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be.\n I don\u0027t remember me before.\n I don\u0027t remember.\n I remember T.\n I get up.\n I look out the basement window, across the street, across the way.\n Copper is sitting in his rocker on his porch.\n Copper is looking my way.\n I don\u0027t remember.\n Before the shit.\n I don\u0027t remember much.\n I remember T.\n One good thing is Copper has no sense of smell.\n Miller says he lit fire to a bag of catshit on Copper\u0027s door one Halloween and it was the neighbor who called it in: the old lady was away and Copper didn\u0027t smell a thing.\n The old man can\u0027t smell a damned thing, and that makes a difference.\n Meant we can, if we are careful, pick and choose our approach pattern.\n I went point, and took it a day at a time.\n Copper is watching me now.\n Copper\u0027s right hand is over his left wrist, and he watches me.\n \u0027Your first car was a beat-up Chevy Impala.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember.\n \u0027You rolled it out on Route Four.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember.\n Copper moves his left hand over his right wrist, cupping it.\n \u0027Your mother cried all night.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember.\n \u0027I remember you, kid.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember.\n Another good thing is Copper knows this burb like nobody else.\n He knows it all, including the backstory of every empty house.\n Copper remembers.\n I don\u0027t remember.\n Word is Copper knows the trials and tribs of every occupied house and when who was where and went where and lived it and snuffed it.\n I don\u0027t remember. Once, I knew some of it, but no more.\n Stout remembers.\n Fetus remembers.\n Word is that Copper and Becca settled here after Korea.\n Word is that young Copper had been in just about every one of these houses, those left standing.\n Word is that Copper and Becca had been in and out of these doors, on and off these front and back porches, and grilled and drank and spat in these backyards for longer than I\u0027ve been on this mudball, before or after the day.\n Word is that middle-aged Copper had done some handiwork in just about every house within six blocks, at one time or another.\n Word is that old man Copper has kept watch every day of his life, especially since Becca was planted.\n Old man Copper watches me now.\n I wave.\n Old man Copper watches and doesn\u0027t move.\n I sit.\n Old man Copper sits.\n What Copper built, T takes.\n House by house, shell by shell.\n What Copper knew, T sells.\n T takes it all.\n T and his crew work fast, under cover of night.\n In through a cellar window, case the joint.\n T goes in. Always T.\n T cases his own shells.\n T through the window, in and out, rally the boys and clean it out, fast.\n Tally, score.\n The amateurs start with the laundry room and boiler, maybe the radiators if they can get them out.\n T has it down to a science.\n Tools, not by hand.\n Professionals.\n Out with the plumbing and gas fixtures - hot-water cylinder, the copper pipes, the spouting, the pumps.\n Cut the gas line when needed; whatever.\n One house blew and burned on Orvis Street; not T\u0027s worry.\n That is the amateurs.\n T never blows a house.\n Might be more to take.\n Easy yield of three to five hundred or more per property on copper alone.\n The rest is gravy.\n Sweet.\n House by house, street by street, block by block, up the ante.\n Air-conditioner handlers and compressors.\n House in good shape, T and company snag kitchen cabinets, toilets, French doors, windows.\n Bathroom vanities, especially when they\u0027re choice.\n T takes it all.\n There\u0027s T.\n T drives by Copper\u0027s house.\n I see T drive by Copper\u0027s house.\n T doesn\u0027t turn to look at Copper.\n Copper doesn\u0027t look at T.\n Copper is sitting.\n I am sitting on Copper\u0027s porch step.\n \u0027Have you thought about it?\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027I appreciate the offer, kid.\u0027\n Copper looks at me.\n \u0027I don\u0027t need anybody, kid.\u0027\n I look at Copper.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got mine, and I don\u0027t need anybody.\u0027\n I look at Copper.\n \u0027Besides, I\u0027m home, always home.\u0027\n I look at Copper.\n \u0027Nobody\u0027s going to be breaking into my place.\u0027\n Copper looks away.\n \u0027Appreciate the offer, though.\u0027\n I look away.\n \u0027You\u0027re OK, kid. I remember you.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember.\n \u0027But I don\u0027t know your buddies, and I don\u0027t want them around here.\u0027\n I sit on Copper\u0027s porch steps.\n I look over at the shell across the street.\n There\u0027s T.\n T drives by Copper\u0027s house.\n I see T drive by Copper\u0027s house.\n T doesn\u0027t turn to look at Copper.\n Copper doesn\u0027t look at T.\n T turns to look at me.\n T waves at me.\n I lift my hand and wave back.\n I watch T drive away.\n Copper spits.\n \u0027For that matter, I reckon I don\u0027t want you coming around for a while.\u0027\n I look away.\n I get up.\n I walk.\n I walk.\n Fetus and I walk.\n Nobody notices.\n Nobody cares.\n Fetus and I walk two days, two nights.\n Fetus and I find new shells.\n Fetus and I hunker down.\n Fetus and I feed in the shells.\n Fetus and I meet Croak and Shimmy.\n Croak was with the Tenth Mountain Division, ended up in Afghan istan with the Eighty-second Airborne. Shimmy was in Uruzgan Province. Talk talk talk.\n We talk shit.\n Croak and Shimmy show us new shells. They call one their FOB.\n Croak and Shimmy invite us in.\n Shimmy shows off two assault rifles he\u0027s stashed in the FOB, and his walking armory.\n Wears an assault vest, jammed with four loaded AK-47 magazines, thirty rounds in each mag. I ask what he needs it for.\n Shimmy laughs.\n Croak and Shimmy and Fetus and me cherry-pick a strip gang in the FOB.\n Croak and Shimmy and Fetus and me dig in.\n Croak and Shimmy and Fetus and me have a fine time.\n Croak and Fetus are shouting.\n Fetus grabs Croak\u0027s left ear.

It\u0027s cold on McKinley.\n The subzero temps kiss my dick; the wet bead of blood and jizz on the tip deep- freezes into an instant Santa\u0027s cap.\n My joint blues and splits with a sudden snap, like a log in a splitter.\n I\u0027m pushing my helmet between my legs to cover my nuts, keep them warm, careful not to hit my bleeding rod, but my nuts are in full retreat, my sac hard and taut and wrinkled like a walnut and my cojones seeking warmth up in my fucking lungs, a height from which they will never drop ever again.\n I wake up.\n It\u0027s how I wake up every time I sleep the sleep of the dead, which isn\u0027t sleep at all, it\u0027s reruns.\n I grope around down there to see if anything\u0027s wet.\n Hand to crotch.\n Dry as a bone.\n Dry reruns.\n I am standing by T\u0027s car.\n You\u0027d think he could smell me.\n Maybe he can; T won\u0027t let me in his car.\n I must be getting rank; I can\u0027t tell.\n I am outside T\u0027s car.\n T is quiet.\n It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve been near T\u0027s car since I came back.\n I can\u0027t remember coming back.\n T\u0027s just chilling, waiting.\n T\u0027s watching Copper, a block away.\n I\u0027m not watching Copper.\n I am looking down at the sidewalk.\n Among the tags on what\u0027s left of the sidewalk, six faded spray-painted letters, now soft as chalk:\n RAPIST\n Two yellow-orange letters intrude, the colors still vibrant:\n TRAPpIST\n That\u0027s the best Trapper could muster ten years ago.\n T sees me looking at the sidewalk.\n T clears his throat.\n \u0027Shit, man, leaving a bigger mark now.\u0027\n T won\u0027t look at me.\n T glares at the Baker house.\n \u0027You gut something, you leave a mark.\u0027\n \u0027Where\u0027s everyone?\u0027 I ask.\n T looks away.\n \u0027I only see you around here.\u0027\n T smiles.\n \u0027Me and that old fucker,\u0027 T says.\n \u0027Copper.\u0027\n \u0027That his name?\u0027\n \u0027What about Jeph?\u0027\n \u0027J? Shit. Don\u0027t ask.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m asking.\u0027\n T puts his long fingers to his face, pinches his eyes.\n There\u0027s a ring on every finger.\n \u0027J and C. Shit.\u0027\n \u0027C?\u0027\n \u0027Connie, man. You remember.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember.\n T remembers.\n \u0027They got each other through high school and through all kinds of neighborhood shit.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s a lot of shit, T.\u0027\n \u0027That shit killed a lot of folks, y\u0027know?\u0027\n \u0027Killed me.\u0027\n I remember dying, in the Baker House basement.\n I remember the needle, the cold, the slow draining, the cold.\n T laughs.\n T thinks I\u0027m joking.\n T keeps his eyes closed.\n \u0027Jeph just about got to graduation, and Connie was honor roll her freshman and sophomore year. But she was two years younger than Jeph, and her father hated his bones; like, sicko shit, man. Made no sense.\u0027\n T\u0027s a talker. Always was.\n I let him.\n I keep mum.\n T leans in close. He stinks of anger.\n \u0027No sooner J turned eighteen to the second than her pop had the state on his ass for statutory rape.\u0027\n T pointed to the Baker digs.\n \u0027Right fucking there, man. The cops crashed his birthday party and took him out in handcuffs.\u0027\n He shuts up, still working his bile.\n \u0027I remember.\u0027\n I do remember.\n T, just a kid, crying.\n J in the cop car.\n Connie crying.\n I remember.\n \u0027Turns out her pop had been prepping for this for over a year; had witnesses lined up and everything.\u0027\n \u0027Set up.\u0027\n \u0027The sick fuck joke of it all is Jeph and Connie had never done the deed.\u0027\n T glares at the Baker house.\n \u0027She was still a virgin, saving herself for when she turned eighteen and they could marry. That meant they\u0027d done everything but the mission - you name it, anything to bring her pleasure but keep her pure, crazy-ass abstinence-only shit, all short of the deed.\u0027\n \u0027Huh.\u0027\n \u0027She was still cherry, but Connie\u0027s dad got the medical examination barred from testimony. And J got four years in the pen.\u0027\n I remember.\n \u0027Connie gave up. She banged every swinging dick in the se nior class and ditched home base before her seventeenth. She was gone baby gone; stopped writing J after he told her what was happening to him after lights out.\u0027\n T\u0027s eyes are slits, cold blades.\n \u0027He fought, but Jeph wasn\u0027t packing muscle; he was a skinny kid. Lost it all on his eighteenth birthday, all for loving that bitch and being a stand-up beau.\u0027\n \u0027You?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m hard long before Iraq.\u0027\n I think, T, you were never there.\n I say, \u0027Yep.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m hard from the second I saw them cram his head down into the backseat of the cruiser. I see that move - man\u0027s hand on his head, pushing him down - every time I thought of what J had to do to survive in the pen.\u0027\n T bites something back, spits.\n \u0027That lovey-dovey true- love shit hit the wind forever. Fuck that, fuck family, fuck this whole fucking shit-hole. Jeph believed all that, lived all that, and it got him sucking sap with his ass spread, shooting shit to shut it all out.\u0027\n \u0027You and Uncle Sam?\u0027\n \u0027I fucked every girl I could before the end of my seventeenth year and signed up and off to boot the day of my eighteenth birthday. Nine-eleven was my ticket out.\u0027\n T grinned at the Baker digs.\n \u0027Just wish I coulda torched Connie\u0027s home into the fucking cellar before I was on the bus.\u0027\n \u0027Now?\u0027\n \u0027Shit, ain\u0027t you been listening?\u0027\n T leans in close and hisses at me.\n \u0027I\u0027m gonna strip and torch every shell in this shit-hole - every stick - and I\u0027m gonna fuck and fuck up every cat, every dog, every four legged or two-legged or one-legged motherfucker I find here.\u0027\n T taps my ring.\n \u0027And I\u0027m going to get fucking rich doin\u0027 it.\u0027\n I\u0027ve got nothing to say.\n T wants, T waits, but I\u0027ve got nothing.\n \u0027Man, get your stinky shit offa my car. You gotta fucking shower,\u0027 T snarls.\n I grunt.\n \u0027You got no pride? Man can\u0027t carry his shit in his drawers.\u0027\n T turns on me.\n \u0027Get away from my car, you fuck! You ain\u0027t gonna stain my honeybucket!\u0027\n I step away from T\u0027s car.\n \u0027I leave you alone, you leave me alone - deal? For old time\u0027s sake,\u0027 T snarls.\n I\u0027m standing on the T and the R in TRAPpIST.\n \u0027Clean yourself up, man! Got no more pride?\u0027\n I look down.\n T drives away.\n I stand on the sidewalk and look up.\n Copper sits on his porch.\n Copper watches.\n Copper sits on his porch.\n I sit on Copper\u0027s step.\n \u0027I see you and your buddies.\u0027\n Good thing he can\u0027t smell.\n \u0027T is no buddy of mine,\u0027 I stammer.\n Copper spits.\n \u0027Not him. The others.\u0027\n Copper looks at me.\n \u0027I see you in that basement where you don\u0027t belong.\u0027\n T drives by.\n Copper watches T drive by but acts like he doesn\u0027t.\n T doesn\u0027t look at Copper.\n T drives out of sight.\n \u0027I see you with that boy too.\u0027\n \u0027Trapper. T.\u0027\n \u0027I remember his family.\u0027\n I can\u0027t remember.\n \u0027Good family.\u0027\n Now I remember.\n \u0027You remember his brother?\u0027 I ask.\n Copper looks over at the Baker house.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he whispers. \u0027I remember.\u0027\n \u0027T hates this place.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027T. He hates this place.\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t blame a whole town for what one damned fool does.\u0027\n I don\u0027t remember this place, before.\n I remember T, before.\n I remember T smiling at me, after he signed up.\n \u0027This was a good place, once.\u0027\n Copper looks at me.\n \u0027I don\u0027t remember.\u0027\n We sit on Copper\u0027s porch.\n \u0027We live in the basements.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027We.\u0027\n \u0027We.\u0027\n \u0027I see uniforms.\u0027\n I rattle off our names, ranks, branches, service records.\n Don\u0027t even have to think about it.\n I remember.\n \u0027We stay in the basements. Feels safe down there.\u0027\n Copper looks at me.\n \u0027All of you?\u0027\n \u0027All but McFay - McFadyen. We all signed up after nine-eleven.\u0027\n Copper looks hard at me.\n I rattle off where we were out of, where we were stationed, where we came back to.\n When we were back.\n I stop there.\n \u0027You did your country proud, kid.\u0027\n \u0027Bullshit.\u0027\n \u0027No need for language, kid.\u0027\n I remember dying in the Baker-house basement.\n \u0027Nobody cares, nobody.\u0027\n Copper shifts in his rocker.\n \u0027Didn\u0027t I just say I do?\u0027\n \u0027Nobody knows we\u0027re here.\u0027\n Copper looks over at the Baker house.\n \u0027You got the short end of the stick, kid.\u0027\n I remember draining into the floor of the Baker basement.\n I remember the cold.\n I remember.\n Copper spits.\n \u0027They didn\u0027t treat us like that back in the day.\u0027\n Copper\u0027s voice is hard, cutting.\n \u0027I stayed on. Joined the Guard afterward. The service treated me and mine good. Still do.\u0027\n I remember dying in the basement, over there.\n I look down.\n \u0027You\u0027ve got no pride.\u0027\n \u0027We don\u0027t bother anybody.\u0027\n \u0027Squatters.\u0027\n I tipped my chin toward what was left of the neighborhood.\n \u0027These houses, they\u0027re empty.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re empty.\u0027\n \u0027Old man, you don\u0027t know the half of it.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027So tell me.\u0027\n Copper sits on his rocker.\n I hunker down on the top stair, drop my voice.\n I tell him about dying in the Baker basement.\n I remember, and I tell him.\n I don\u0027t tell him how much it hurt to die.\n I do tell him it doesn\u0027t hurt any more.\n Copper looks at me, close, real close.\n \u0027You\u0027re not lying,\u0027 he whispers.\n I look at Copper.\n Copper looks at me.\n Sizing me up.\n Copper looks at me.\n I look at Copper.\n A long time.\n \u0027Why doesn\u0027t anyone-\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re everywhere. Nobody sees us.\u0027\n Copper looks away.\n \u0027There\u0027s empty houses everywhere. Every town.\u0027\n Copper coughs.\n \u0027We move from town to town, city to city. There\u0027s empty houses everywhere.\u0027\n \u0027Like here.\u0027\n \u0027Like here.\u0027\n I tip my head back to look at Copper.\n \u0027I had to come back here. Don\u0027t know why.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s home.\u0027\n \u0027Home.\u0027\n The old man looks at me.\n \u0027Shells. They\u0027re everywhere. We move in. We move out. We move around.\u0027\n \u0027What about your vet benefits? How do you-\u0027\n A dry rasp. My laugh.\n \u0027There was nothing to count on when I was still ticking.\u0027\n I laugh.\n \u0027Sure ain\u0027t shit now. They don\u0027t even know I\u0027m dead.\u0027\n Copper sits on his porch.\n \u0027Waited nine months to see a shrink. Never saw him.\u0027\n \u0027What happened to you over there, kid?\u0027\n I remember.\n I tap my forehead.\n \u0027TBI. Took a hit from below - IED. Blew me right out of the HMMWV.\u0027\n I remember.\n \u0027Shipped me back. Took care of me till I was stateside.\u0027\n I remember.\n \u0027Then all I could do was self-medicate. Not a good idea. Released me - honorable discharge - for drunk and disorderly.\u0027\n I remember.\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t get treatment. Couldn\u0027t get help. Couldn\u0027t get the time of day.\u0027\n I remember.\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t get out of my own way.\u0027\n I remember dying.\n \u0027Waited nine months.\u0027\n I remember the smell of the basement floor.\n \u0027Nobody ever saw me.\u0027\n I remember dying in the Baker house basement.\n \u0027Found my own way to deal with the headaches.\u0027\n I remember the basement floor, draining out onto it, into it.\n \u0027Nobody sees us.\u0027\n I remember.\n \u0027Nobody cares. We bother nobody.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027You\u0027re bothering me, kid.\u0027\n \u0027We gravitate to our hometowns, if they\u0027re big enough.\u0027\n Copper spits again and turns to me.\n \u0027How do you live?\u0027\n \u0027Live?\u0027\n I let that hang.\n I let that hang a long time.\n \u0027What do you live on, kid?\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s plenty to live on.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n I spit.\n \u0027They just come to us.\u0027\n \u0027Who?\u0027\n \u0027Kids. Gangs. Shell strippers.\u0027\n Copper sits on his porch.\n \u0027They come to us in the shells.\u0027\n Copper sits on his porch.\n \u0027We take them.\u0027\n Copper sits on his rocker.\n I sit on his porch step.\n The sun is behind the trees.\n The crickets sing, quiet at first, then louder.\n Copper sits on his porch.\n I sit on his porch step.\n \u0027So, what\u0027s this got to do with me?\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s nothing left here but you and us and strippers like T.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not in your army, kid.\u0027\n \u0027It isn\u0027t an army.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027Never was.\u0027\n His lunger shimmers a light green on the brown lawn.\n \u0027You\u0027re the same as that kid I see you with. T.\u0027\n \u0027We haven\u0027t taken anything.\u0027\n \u0027Suit yourself.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s been left for us.\u0027\n \u0027You take them.\u0027\n \u0027They come to us. They take, we take.\u0027\n Copper spits.\n \u0027I didn\u0027t sign up for this.\u0027\n \u0027Shit, none of us did.\u0027\n \u0027No need for language, kid.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll clear out for now.\u0027\n Copper turns away.\n \u0027For the best.\u0027\n I look up the street.\n \u0027T?\u0027\n \u0027What about T?\u0027\n \u0027We watch out for you, old man.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve got nothing left to take.\u0027\n I remember T saying what he said.\n \u0027He\u0027ll leave me be.\u0027\n I remember Copper flinching by the basement door.\n I remember dying in the Baker basement.\n I don\u0027t remember what I had before I lost it.\n \u0027Your call, old man.\u0027\n Copper sighs, won\u0027t look at me.\n \u0027Dead meat, no use to anyone.\u0027\n Copper looks over his porch railing to the boarded-up windows of 272 Gilmore.\n \u0027You\u0027re no use to me at all.\u0027\n Copper moves his left hand over his right wrist.\n \u0027Getting colder.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t matter.\u0027\n Copper looks at me with those baby blues, clouded with age and loss and pain and the coming cold and the sure knowledge of how cold it\u0027s going to get.\n \u0027We don\u0027t feel it, old man.\u0027\n Copper looks at me for a long, long time.\n \u0027We don\u0027t feel nothing.\u0027\n I look up at Copper.\n \u0027No cold.\u0027\n Copper gets up and goes inside.\n Maybe he does know.\n I walk down Gilmore to Spruce and turn right.\n Stout winks at me from the basement window of Ratboy\u0027s old digs.\n Fetus and Shiner meet me in front of the old Baker home, and we go inside.\n It is our last night in the Baker digs.\n Stout stays behind while Fetus, Shiner, and me hook up with the two amputees and McFay to squat in a new basement on the other end of town.\n We pull down four of the strip gangs over the next two months.\n McFay is skank enough to keep tabs on the latest discards, and we move from shell to shell, lingering on the upper floors until Shiner brings some action our way.\n Shiner is fresh enough to mingle and spread the word among the lifers that there\u0027s cherry-pickings in the new shells.\n We sit tight for a time until the action arrives.\n Let them go to work on the plumbing and wiring downstairs, letting the noise cover our formation.\n Take them out, one by one, then dig in.\n We tie on the feed bag and sit tight for more.\n Usually can get one, two strip teams before it\u0027s time to move on.\n More come.\n It\u0027s a big town.\n It\u0027s a big state.\n There\u0027s a lot of shells.\n There\u0027s a lot of strip gangs.\n It\u0027s a long winter.\n Word is Copper lost his nest egg on the repairs after T stripped Copper\u0027s house.\n Word is the repairs sucked up over twenty grand.\n Word is no sooner did Copper replace the gutted plumbing and wiring than the insurance inspectors showed up and demanded further repairs on the roof and clapboards, on threat of cancellation of policy.\n Word is Copper had to refinance to make those repairs, and on his lonesome signed away the farm without even knowing it.\n Word is a zombie bank ate Copper\u0027s bankroll.\n A zombie fucking bank.\n Zombie bank?\n What a world.\n Word is even with his veteran benefits, Copper thought he was broke.\n Wouldn\u0027t have happened with Becca.\n She would have kept the paperwork straight.\n Copper was never any good with all that.\n Word is he thought he was so high and dry by St Patty\u0027s Day that he stopped paying some bills.\n Word is the power company shut him off, the last house on Gil more with juice dark at last.\n Word is the juice was off when the cold snap hit, nights of ten below.\n Word is Copper is still there.\n I enter through the kitchen door.\n I\u0027ve been here before.\n I remember.\n Kitchen all neat.\n Shelves, pantry, cupboards.\n All neat, nice.\n Copper keeps it nice.\n In the kitchen window, a ceramic sign.\n It\u0027s dark, I can\u0027t read it.\n I remember, though:\n WHOEVER DIES WITH THE MOST THINGS, WINS.\n I rest my fingers on Copper\u0027s oak table.\n I pass the cellar door by the pantry.\n I walk down the hallway.\n The quilt is not on the wall.\n I touch the wall.\n I leave a little stain on the wall.\n I walk down the hallway.\n I find Copper in the living room.\n I find Copper in the front room, on his chair.\n There are six blankets over him, all askew.\n There are six blankets and a quilt over Copper.\n Becca\u0027s quilt is bundled close to his neck.\n Cloth houses on the cloth street, bundled around Copper\u0027s neck.\n Cloth Copper on his cloth rocker on his cloth porch.\n Cloth Copper with a stain on his cloth clothes.\n I put that stain there.\n There\u0027s a fresh stain over mine.\n A stain from Copper\u0027s mouth.\n A reddish, ruddy stain.\n Copper sits in his chair.\n Copper, wrapped in the cloth houses and cloth street and cloth neighbors and cloth Copper in his cloth rocker on his cloth porch.\n Six blankets and the cloth neighborhood didn\u0027t keep him warm.\n Six blankets and a quilt, but how to cover oneself when you can\u0027t feel your fingers?\n Six blankets and a quilt, but it\u0027s not enough, and it doesn\u0027t quite do the trick.\n Six blankets and a quilt, but one leg is bare between the top of the sock and edge of the pant leg, its crease gone.\n The bare skin is blue-white.\n Copper is blue-white, his skin the color of his eyes.\n Under the blankets, his right hand is wrapped over his left wrist, his left hand clutching his right wrist, his fingers locked over wrists like dead crow feet.\n The cold bit deep this time, deeper than deep.\n Copper\u0027s face is waxed, his jaw fixed cocked to the side, his lower gums bared, mouth slightly open.\n A light frost bristles on his lips, spiking from his unshaven chin, whiter than the paraffin-white of his skin.\n The frost continues down onto the cloth Copper on his cloth rocker on his cloth porch.\n Copper\u0027s spider-leg eyebrows crook upward over his nose, frozen in surprise.\n I remember dying in the Baker basement.\n It was cold.\n Copper hates the cold.\n Copper hates the cold, but it still took him by surprise, a slow, steely revelation of how bad it really had become, could be, was, is.\n It took Copper hard.\n It hurt.\n It took a long fucking time, and it fucking hurt; it hurt bad.\n The cold took him and his and all he still had and all he\u0027d been.\n Took it hard.\n I sit and watch.\n I sit and watch Copper.\n I watch him until he\u0027s watching me.\n I watch his eyes trade one glaze for another, just like when I watched Fetus when his eyes did the same thing.\n When was that?\n I can\u0027t remember.\n I watch Copper\u0027s brow furrow, his milky blues go from watching nothing to watching something to eventually taking me in.\n \u0027It hurt, didn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Copper straightens his jaw.\n His jaw pops, and he works it back and forth.\n \u0027The cold, I mean.\u0027\n He closes his mouth and purses his lips, testing them, like an infant.\n \u0027It really fucking hurt, didn\u0027t it, old man?\u0027\n Copper glares at me.\n \u0027No need for language, kid.\u0027\n Turns out Fetus and I were right.\n Turns out Copper is just what we need:\n A commanding officer.\n Copper takes command.\n Copper knows the neighborhood.\n Turns out Copper knows more than this neighborhood.\n Copper knows more than this burb.\n Turns out Copper knows most of the city.\n Turns out Copper has maps and charts and floor plans.\n \u0027How do you remember all this?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Worked in just about every nook and cranny at some point, kid.\u0027\n Copper winks at me when he says it.\n \u0027What I didn\u0027t work, my brother-in law did.\u0027\n Copper reprimands us for thinking small.\n Copper has plans.\n Copper has plans and makes plans.\n Copper is in command.\n Copper sets up his command outpost in his own basement.\n Copper doesn\u0027t flinch at the basement door.\n Copper leads us all downstairs.\n Basement is clean, neat, tidy. Like the whole house.\n Copper spreads out the floor plans and the street plans, and Copper looks and makes marks and asks questions and looks some more.\n Copper calls Fetus and Stout and Shiner and McFay and those two amputees and me in for a powwow.\n He lays it all out and we drink it all in and we sit real quiet for a long time and think about it, and we sit real quiet.\n Copper calls Shiner and Fetus in with state maps.\n Copper has big plans.\n I stop dreaming about Mount McKinley.\n I can\u0027t remember Mount McKinley any more.\n I wake up on the cot Copper provides and I make my bed.\n I fold the corners the way I was taught in -\n I can\u0027t remember.\n Copper reminds me.\n I remember dying in the Baker house basement.\n Now I\u0027m in Copper\u0027s basement.\n It\u0027s nice.\n Copper brings us LED lights.\n Copper brings in stuff to read.\n It\u0027s nice.\n I don\u0027t remember the cold.\n I remember how to make my bed.\n I don\u0027t remember Mount McKinley.\n Copper stays put on his porch, day after day, and watches.\n Copper watches the cops drive by when they bother to drive by at all, and they don\u0027t wave, and Copper doesn\u0027t wave.\n Copper doesn\u0027t cup his wrists in his hands any more, because Copper doesn\u0027t feel the cold any more.\n Nobody knows Copper doesn\u0027t feel the cold, no more than anyone knows how badly he felt it over his long, slow passing back in March, except for me.\n Copper watches, and nobody knows any better.\n Nobody is watching.\n Nobody cares.\n Copper is watching.\n Copper cares.\n Copper sees T drive by.\n Copper watches T drive by.\n T doesn\u0027t turn his head.\n Copper doesn\u0027t wave.\n Copper and Shiner go away for -\n I don\u0027t remember.\n I remember how to make my bed.\n I sit on Copper\u0027s porch but never in his rocker.\n I look out the Baker-house basement window.\n I remember Copper.\n Copper and Shiner come back in a pickup truck with two other men.\n Copper and Shiner meet with the men for I don\u0027t know how long.\n Copper and Shiner put away the state maps and the map of the United States and call me and Stout and McFay in.\n \u0027Pack your gear, we\u0027re moving out next week, kid.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll miss you.\u0027\n \u0027No, no, you\u0027re coming too.\u0027\n Copper winks.\n \u0027New detail. New plans.\u0027\n Copper talks about the big plan.\n Lots of towns, lots of houses.\n Lots of states.\n \u0027Will we come back?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Back?\u0027\n \u0027Home?\u0027\n \u0027Wherever we are, kid, it\u0027ll be home.\u0027\n Home.\n \u0027This country is our home.\u0027\n Home.\n \u0027We\u0027ll make it our home.\u0027\n Plans.\n \u0027This country owes you that much, kid.\u0027\n Plans.\n Homes.\n Cities.\n States.\n A whole big country, full of grunts like us.\n Nobody sees us.\n Nobody cares.\n Nobody cares about our plans.\n Lots of plans.\n \u0027We move out next week.\u0027\n Copper winks at me.\n \u0027We\u0027ve got a job to finish.\u0027\n Copper lays out the floor plans and points to the street plan and hands his pickup keys to McFay.\n McFay and Shiner drive off and come back.\n Stout and me stack the copper piping just as we were told to - half in and half out of Copper\u0027s basement window.\n Stout leaves two coils of wire in Copper\u0027s driveway, one leaning against the basement-window casing.\n Shiner is boarding up the other windows.\n Shiner leaves only one window open - the one with the pipes half in, half out.\n Copper sits on his porch, watching.\n Copper and I sit on this porch.\n Copper sits on his porch.\n Copper sees T drive by.\n Copper watches T drive by.\n T doesn\u0027t turn his head.\n Copper waves.\n Copper sits in his basement.\n Copper looks at an old stain on the wall.\n Fetus and Shiner and McFay sit on the bench by the furnace, which hasn\u0027t fired up in months.\n I sit by the two amputees in the far corner.\n Copper sits in his basement with us.\n We hear the crunch of gravel outside, footsteps on the driveway.\n Copper sits in his basement.\n The piping in the window moves.\n Copper sits in his basement.\n The piping shifts and then slowly slides out of the window frame, into the night.\n Copper sits in the basement.\n Fetus and Shiner and I sit tight.\n McFay sits still.\n A flashlight beam cuts in from the open window.\n Copper sits in the basement, satisfied with his plan.\n We\u0027re positioned just so.\n The flashlight beam can\u0027t reach us.\n The beam alights on lengths of copper pipes and coils of wiring.\n T\u0027s head appears at the window.\n Copper cocks his head slightly, listening.\n There\u0027s only the sound of T, moving with all the stealth he can muster.\n It isn\u0027t much.\n T is alone.\n Copper sits in the basement.\n T leans his head in farther, craning for a better look-see.\n Copper gives the order.\n Copper\u0027s hands are on T, his fingers locked around the kid\u0027s head, one thumb deep in his left eye socket.\n T shrieks like a girl and tries to lash out, but I\u0027ve got his right arm and Fetus is on the other and he\u0027s our wishbone.\n We pull as one and something gives and something splashes black from the windowsill and something deeper than shadow pools across the floor, and T\u0027s screams grow louder as we pull him in.\n Fetus bends to drink from the floor in a rectangle of moonlight.\n I see Stout\u0027s smile.\n His teeth are black and violet in the dim light, his chin is wet, dimples deep.\n Before he is out of eyeshot, he gulps like a newborn, stopping only once to tip his head back and gurgle with joy.\n Window becomes mouth, cellar becomes throat; broken glass teeth slip through T.\n T spills inside, and we take him and his and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be.\n I help Copper pull T\u0027s wiring and strip his plumbing.\n T\u0027s song is sweet, shrill, short. Copper is humming to himself.\n Dark, tough laces of T cat-cradle between us, ropes of him spill, stretch, and break. The cement is baptized with beads of him and puddles of him and steaming streams and rivers and oceans of him.\n We spread him; he is bread, water, wine.\n We dig in.\n Blood becomes rust, bone becomes sliver; flesh becomes fire, death becomes home.\n Home.\n Always home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology/page-4.html","bookId":2463,"book":{"id":2463,"title":"The New Dead: A Zombie Anthology","description":"Storyline: \n Resurrection! \n The hungry dead have risen.
