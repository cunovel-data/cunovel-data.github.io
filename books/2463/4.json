{"id":81257,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"BY STEPHEN R . BISSETTE\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m home, always home.\u0027\\n\\n Copper stands rock-solid, squints at the noise from across the street.\\n\\n As usual, the cops didn\u0027t show until long after the action was over.\\n\\n Copper squints and spits over the railing.\\n\\n \u0027If you need a statement, you know where to find me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We won\u0027t be needing a statement, sir.\u0027\\n\\n Copper\u0027s eyes shift downward, to the young policeman\u0027s face. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s made eye contact with the kid.\\n\\n The policeman is a kid - hell, even I can tell he\u0027s barely out of the academy. I can see that from where I\u0027m looking out, three houses away.\\n\\n \u0027No questions, nothin\u0027 at all?\u0027\\n\\n Copper spits again, looks from the man in uniform doing nothing, to the men in uniform across the street, also doing nothing.\\n\\n \u0027This is the sixth house they\u0027ve gutted in this neighborhood. \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir, we appreciate your calling it in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I seen it all and I called it in - twenty-six hours ago.\u0027\\n\\n Copper lets that one stand. He tilts his head, cocking his neck, staring the policeman down.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve called in every goddamned one of \u0027em.\u0027\\n\\n I can see the white of the cop\u0027s scalp when he looks away from the old man\u0027s glare.\\n\\n The kid clears his throat and looks down, as if there were something of importance in his hand. He already closed his notebook. What can there be to look at? He doesn\u0027t even have calluses to gander at.\\n\\n \u0027City just doesn\u0027t care, does it?\u0027\\n\\n The kid\u0027s crew cut is too close, like a fresh military cut. His scalp gleams like a baby\u0027s knee. This kid is green, the type that needs a weekly trim and says so, as if that were part and parcel of being a cop, to make up for doing nothing.\\n\\n \u0027But come tax reassessment time, the city is right at my door.\u0027\\n\\n Of course they send him to talk to Copper.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got one question, officer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that, Mr Cyrus?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027re you going to do when they come after my house?\u0027\\n\\n If there is a reply, he doesn\u0027t stay long enough to hear it.\\n\\n The screen door slaps closed without a whisper from the hinges. Copper keeps everything shipshape; no squeaking door on his watch.\\n\\n It doesn\u0027t matter. The cop is on his heel and away, too. His polished shoes are too smart on the tarmac; the crease of his pantlegs are sharp as a paper cut.\\n\\n He shakes his head and mutters something I can\u0027t make out, and his cop cronies make some wisecrack back at him, and they all have a hearty laugh at Copper\u0027s expense.\\n\\n Anything to clear the air of the old man\u0027s comment, ignore the truth of it, pretend it wasn\u0027t said or heard or didn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n I lay low and watch the old man\u0027s porch.\\n\\n I dream of Mount McKinley.\\n\\n I dream of fucking, and climbing, and cold, and pain and cold.\\n\\n I dream of my dick splitting in half.\\n\\n I wake up on the bare cement floor in the basement of the Baker house.\\n\\n No pain.\\n\\n No cold.\\n\\n I hear Fetus moving around upstairs.\\n\\n I stand up. Go to the window.\\n\\n Still have to tell myself I\u0027m home.\\n\\n Home.\\n\\n My hometown didn\u0027t used to look like this.\\n\\n It\u0027s looking more like the east side of Baghdad every day. Damn near every house looted, gutted, no electricity, no running water.\\n\\n I look past the row of shells.\\n\\n Every house on this street is abandoned but one.\\n\\n It\u0027s the same for blocks.\\n\\n A neighborhood of shells.\\n\\n Windows boarded up, sheets of plywood over doorways, broken panes, sagging clapboards, chipping paint, ragged shingles.\\n\\n All but one.\\n\\n I see Copper across the way and up the street, sitting on his porch.\\n\\n Copper sits on his rocker on his porch.\\n\\n I remember I have something to do.\\n\\n \u0027So what you want from me?\u0027\\n\\n Copper sits on his rocker on his porch, still as a stump. One spot- flecked hand over his other wrist.\\n\\n It\u0027s an odd position, and he changes hands to cup the opposite wrist, if you are with him long enough to notice.\\n\\n Copper later tells me that\u0027s how the cold hits him: it stabs his wrists.\\n\\n His wrists get cold, a deep cold that starts slow before it bites to the marrow and lingers. \u0027Started when I was in my mid fifties,\u0027 he later says, \u0027and the damned thing is, it\u0027s same as when I was in Korea. Same cold, as if I\u0027d never left it. Like it followed me here.\u0027\\n\\n But that is later.\\n\\n Today, he sits with one hand over t\u0027other, over the wrist, and gazes at me with those milky blue eyes of his.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re here all the time,\u0027 I say. \u0027I see you keeping watch.\u0027\\n\\n He turns his head and spits without taking his hand off that wrist. Over the rail it goes, a shimmering clam arcing into the perfectly trimmed grass.\\n\\n \u0027Yep, I\u0027m home, always home. What of it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, we\u0027re looking to start a neighborhood watch.\u0027\\n\\n His eyes don\u0027t so much as quiver.\\n\\n His lips are tight, white, top and bottom.\\n\\n \u0027Keep an eye on one another\u0027s houses, watch out for one another,\u0027 I offer.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m home.\u0027\\n\\n Another lunger over the rail, into the perfect green grass, somehow without breaking gaze with me.\\n\\n \u0027Always home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027\\n\\n We let that hang in the air.\\n\\n We let it hang a while, let it slide to quiet and seep in, like his spit on the blade of grass below is hanging then seeping, though I can\u0027t say for sure it is or does, as I\u0027m watching Copper.\\n\\n Copper doesn\u0027t move a notch, and he won\u0027t.\\n\\n Up to me, since I\u0027m the one intruding, to break the silence.\\n\\n \u0027Since you keep an eye out, it seemed-\u0027\\n\\n Without breaking the gaze, another lunger, over the rail.\\n\\n Though his milky blues don\u0027t so much as shift, I can tell he\u0027s sizing me up - seeing if I break the stare to track his lunger, to see if it\u0027s green as the green-green St Patty\u0027s Day grass.\\n\\n Copper\u0027s lawn is perfect, always perfect, the only cut and green lawn on the block, and Copper\u0027s lungers won\u0027t change that a whit. His eyes stay icy, but I can tell he\u0027s a bit amused by all this.\\n\\n What they say, clear as crystal, is what he won\u0027t say.\\n\\n \u0027-you know, we watch out for one another.\u0027\\n\\n He says it later, just to clear the air.\\n\\n Later, when we get to know one another a bit, when we are in the basement waiting for T.\\n\\n Later, when he tells me about how the cold sunk its choppers into his wrists, about Korea, about \u0027Nam before it was \u0027Nam, about his wife Becca before she was gone, about his calico cat Hank before T took Hank down into the cellar and did the deed, before all that shit hit all those fans.\\n\\n He says later what his eyes say now loud and clear, and I hear just fine. He says it later just to make sure there are no hard feelings.\\n\\n What do I need you for? What do I need you to watch out for me or mine for? What could you possibly offer me that I don\u0027t already do or have done or was or am or will be?\\n\\n I\u0027m home, always home.\\n\\n Later, he says all that.\\n\\n Not now, not on the porch.\\n\\n Not today.\\n\\n He says, \u0027I remember you, kid.\u0027\\n\\n I look at him.\\n\\n \u0027You lived over on Spruce and James. Your mom raised you.\u0027\\n\\n Now, he just glares at me, giving up nothing.\\n\\n \u0027I remember you.\u0027\\n\\n Copper sits on his rocker.\\n\\n We just stay like this for a long, long time.\\n\\n From now to now, then to now.\\n\\n That\u0027s when I know Copper\u0027s our man.\\n\\n That\u0027s when I know we get along just fine.\\n\\n It\u0027s Fetus who suggests I pay the visit, take in the old man\u0027s mettle.\\n\\n It\u0027s Stout who says fuck that, who needs Copper.\\n\\n Stout grew up around the block from Copper and his wife Becca.\\n\\n Stout left for boot camp before the cancer took her. I left a week after.\\n\\n Stout and I were in Baghdad together. Good times. Bad times. OIF 1, the invasion, no food, one MRE per day, nothing too heavy, got to shoot back.\\n\\n Then Thunderdome.\\n\\n Ate Alaskan king crab every night for months at FOB Shield. Weird. Mayberry in the shit.\\n\\n Stout took fire; RPG in the pipeline between Kuwait and Iraq. HMMWV limped away with Stout in it.\\n\\n Stout lost an arm, part of his chest, but all that\u0027s left works. Home he went.\\n\\n Found him here, back home.\\n\\n Stout says fuck Copper.\\n\\n Stout has no use for the old man, never did, but that too changes that night in the basement.\\n\\n Stout wouldn\u0027t brook any ill word about the old lady.\\n\\n Becca babysat for him and his sister, back when they needed sitting.\\n\\n He speaks of it, once, only once.\\n\\n That I remember.\\n\\n Stout\u0027s smile bares his black broken teeth.\\n\\n It\u0027s an occasion whenever Stout smiles.\\n\\n I remember.\\n\\n Stout says the army promised him dental. That was before.\\n\\n The army didn\u0027t take care of dental or much else. The U.S. Army took Stout and took him and his and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be.\\n\\n The U.S. Army took him and left Stout to Stout and left Stout to us.\\n\\n Stout says fuck that, who needs the U.S. Army?\\n\\n Stout says fuck Copper, who needs the old man?\\n\\n Still, it\u0027s Fetus and me who reckon the old man is all right, that we need him.\\n\\n There\u0027s T.\\n\\n T drives by Copper\u0027s house.\\n\\n I see T drive by Copper\u0027s house.\\n\\n T doesn\u0027t turn to look at Copper.\\n\\n Copper doesn\u0027t look at T.\\n\\n T drives toward the Baker digs.\\n\\n T looks at the Baker house.\\n\\n T glares at the Baker house.\\n\\n I watch T drive away.\\n\\n I sit in the basement at the Baker house.\\n\\n I like it here in the basement.\\n\\n Safe. Like in Baghdad.\\n\\n We used to sandbag all the windows.\\n\\n It was dark, except for what light came in through the skylight.\\n\\n The Baker basement is dark. I like it fine.\\n\\n I miss the LED lights I used to strap to my head, but otherwise it\u0027s the same.\\n\\n No electricity. Dark. Sleep all day.\\n\\n Try to remember.\\n\\n Back in the day.\\n\\n I remember when Trapper and I signed up.\\n\\n I remember Trapper - T - I remember T.\\n\\n I remember T when they took his brother away.\\n\\n I remember T after that. T said the cops took him and his and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be. I remember T says that.\\n\\n I remember.\\n\\n I remember T when he grinned at me, after signing up, and I remember the look on the recruiter\u0027s face.\\n\\n Word is T never went over to the shit.\\n\\n Word is T was shipped right back here.\\n\\n Word is T got into some shit, and was kept from the shit.\\n\\n That\u0027s before they were taking anyone, anytime, with any record. Miller tells me that\u0027s how it is now. Two legs, two arms, two eyes, you in.\\n\\n Word is T got into some shit, they booted him before he saw sand.\\n\\n So T made like the Shia did over there - stripped and hauled anything worth anything away.\\n\\n Makes the neighborhood look like Baghdad East.\\n\\n Word is T has made a killing on the neighborhood.\\n\\n Word is T gutted the neighborhood.\\n\\n Shell by shell, T took all it was and sold it.\\n\\n That\u0027s before I got back, before Fetus came back.\\n\\n Fetus took three AK-47 rounds three hundred meters from the Alamo; he shouldn\u0027t have made it.\\n\\n He made it.\\n\\n Came back home.\\n\\n I remember Fetus before the shit.\\n\\n Fetus smoked those fucking French Gauloises, cheap tobacco the locals smoked over there.\\n\\n I remember Fetus before the war took his and him and all he ever was and never was, all he ever had and all he ever might have been but wasn\u0027t and will never be.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember me before.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n I remember T.\\n\\n I get up.\\n\\n I look out the basement window, across the street, across the way.\\n\\n Copper is sitting in his rocker on his porch.\\n\\n Copper is looking my way.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n Before the shit.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember much.\\n\\n I remember T.\\n\\n One good thing is Copper has no sense of smell.\\n\\n Miller says he lit fire to a bag of catshit on Copper\u0027s door one Halloween and it was the neighbor who called it in: the old lady was away and Copper didn\u0027t smell a thing.\\n\\n The old man can\u0027t smell a damned thing, and that makes a difference.\\n\\n Meant we can, if we are careful, pick and choose our approach pattern.\\n\\n I went point, and took it a day at a time.\\n\\n Copper is watching me now.\\n\\n Copper\u0027s right hand is over his left wrist, and he watches me.\\n\\n \u0027Your first car was a beat-up Chevy Impala.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n \u0027You rolled it out on Route Four.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n Copper moves his left hand over his right wrist, cupping it.\\n\\n \u0027Your mother cried all night.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n \u0027I remember you, kid.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n Another good thing is Copper knows this burb like nobody else.\\n\\n He knows it all, including the backstory of every empty house.\\n\\n Copper remembers.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n Word is Copper knows the trials and tribs of every occupied house and when who was where and went where and lived it and snuffed it.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember. Once, I knew some of it, but no more.\\n\\n Stout remembers.\\n\\n Fetus remembers.\\n\\n Word is that Copper and Becca settled here after Korea.\\n\\n Word is that young Copper had been in just about every one of these houses, those left standing.\\n\\n Word is that Copper and Becca had been in and out of these doors, on and off these front and back porches, and grilled and drank and spat in these backyards for longer than I\u0027ve been on this mudball, before or after the day.\\n\\n Word is that middle-aged Copper had done some handiwork in just about every house within six blocks, at one time or another.\\n\\n Word is that old man Copper has kept watch every day of his life, especially since Becca was planted.\\n\\n Old man Copper watches me now.\\n\\n I wave.\\n\\n Old man Copper watches and doesn\u0027t move.\\n\\n I sit.\\n\\n Old man Copper sits.\\n\\n What Copper built, T takes.\\n\\n House by house, shell by shell.\\n\\n What Copper knew, T sells.\\n\\n T takes it all.\\n\\n T and his crew work fast, under cover of night.\\n\\n In through a cellar window, case the joint.\\n\\n T goes in. Always T.\\n\\n T cases his own shells.\\n\\n T through the window, in and out, rally the boys and clean it out, fast.\\n\\n Tally, score.\\n\\n The amateurs start with the laundry room and boiler, maybe the radiators if they can get them out.\\n\\n T has it down to a science.\\n\\n Tools, not by hand.\\n\\n Professionals.\\n\\n Out with the plumbing and gas fixtures - hot-water cylinder, the copper pipes, the spouting, the pumps.\\n\\n Cut the gas line when needed; whatever.\\n\\n One house blew and burned on Orvis Street; not T\u0027s worry.\\n\\n That is the amateurs.\\n\\n T never blows a house.\\n\\n Might be more to take.\\n\\n Easy yield of three to five hundred or more per property on copper alone.\\n\\n The rest is gravy.\\n\\n Sweet.\\n\\n House by house, street by street, block by block, up the ante.\\n\\n Air-conditioner handlers and compressors.\\n\\n House in good shape, T and company snag kitchen cabinets, toilets, French doors, windows.\\n\\n Bathroom vanities, especially when they\u0027re choice.\\n\\n T takes it all.\\n\\n There\u0027s T.\\n\\n T drives by Copper\u0027s house.\\n\\n I see T drive by Copper\u0027s house.\\n\\n T doesn\u0027t turn to look at Copper.\\n\\n Copper doesn\u0027t look at T.\\n\\n Copper is sitting.\\n\\n I am sitting on Copper\u0027s porch step.\\n\\n \u0027Have you thought about it?\u0027\\n\\n Copper spits.\\n\\n \u0027I appreciate the offer, kid.\u0027\\n\\n Copper looks at me.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t need anybody, kid.\u0027\\n\\n I look at Copper.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got mine, and I don\u0027t need anybody.\u0027\\n\\n I look at Copper.\\n\\n \u0027Besides, I\u0027m home, always home.\u0027\\n\\n I look at Copper.\\n\\n \u0027Nobody\u0027s going to be breaking into my place.\u0027\\n\\n Copper looks away.\\n\\n \u0027Appreciate the offer, though.\u0027\\n\\n I look away.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re OK, kid.

out for you, old man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got nothing left to take.\u0027\\n\\n I remember T saying what he said.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll leave me be.\u0027\\n\\n I remember Copper flinching by the basement door.\\n\\n I remember dying in the Baker basement.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember what I had before I lost it.\\n\\n \u0027Your call, old man.\u0027\\n\\n Copper sighs, won\u0027t look at me.\\n\\n \u0027Dead meat, no use to anyone.\u0027\\n\\n Copper looks over his porch railing to the boarded-up windows of 272 Gilmore.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re no use to me at all.\u0027\\n\\n Copper moves his left hand over his right wrist.\\n\\n \u0027Getting colder.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t matter.\u0027\\n\\n Copper looks at me with those baby blues, clouded with age and loss and pain and the coming cold and the sure knowledge of how cold it\u0027s going to get.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t feel it, old man.\u0027\\n\\n Copper looks at me for a long, long time.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t feel nothing.\u0027\\n\\n I look up at Copper.\\n\\n \u0027No cold.\u0027\\n\\n Copper gets up and goes inside.\\n\\n Maybe he does know.\\n\\n I walk down Gilmore to Spruce and turn right.\\n\\n Stout winks at me from the basement window of Ratboy\u0027s old digs.\\n\\n Fetus and Shiner meet me in front of the old Baker home, and we go inside.\\n\\n It is our last night in the Baker digs.\\n\\n Stout stays behind while Fetus, Shiner, and me hook up with the two amputees and McFay to squat in a new basement on the other end of town.\\n\\n We pull down four of the strip gangs over the next two months.\\n\\n McFay is skank enough to keep tabs on the latest discards, and we move from shell to shell, lingering on the upper floors until Shiner brings some action our way.\\n\\n Shiner is fresh enough to mingle and spread the word among the lifers that there\u0027s cherry-pickings in the new shells.\\n\\n We sit tight for a time until the action arrives.\\n\\n Let them go to work on the plumbing and wiring downstairs, letting the noise cover our formation.\\n\\n Take them out, one by one, then dig in.\\n\\n We tie on the feed bag and sit tight for more.\\n\\n Usually can get one, two strip teams before it\u0027s time to move on.\\n\\n More come.\\n\\n It\u0027s a big town.\\n\\n It\u0027s a big state.\\n\\n There\u0027s a lot of shells.\\n\\n There\u0027s a lot of strip gangs.\\n\\n It\u0027s a long winter.\\n\\n Word is Copper lost his nest egg on the repairs after T stripped Copper\u0027s house.\\n\\n Word is the repairs sucked up over twenty grand.\\n\\n Word is no sooner did Copper replace the gutted plumbing and wiring than the insurance inspectors showed up and demanded further repairs on the roof and clapboards, on threat of cancellation of policy.\\n\\n Word is Copper had to refinance to make those repairs, and on his lonesome signed away the farm without even knowing it.\\n\\n Word is a zombie bank ate Copper\u0027s bankroll.\\n\\n A zombie fucking bank.\\n\\n Zombie bank?\\n\\n What a world.\\n\\n Word is even with his veteran benefits, Copper thought he was broke.\\n\\n Wouldn\u0027t have happened with Becca.\\n\\n She would have kept the paperwork straight.\\n\\n Copper was never any good with all that.\\n\\n Word is he thought he was so high and dry by St Patty\u0027s Day that he stopped paying some bills.\\n\\n Word is the power company shut him off, the last house on Gil more with juice dark at last.\\n\\n Word is the juice was off when the cold snap hit, nights of ten below.\\n\\n Word is Copper is still there.\\n\\n I enter through the kitchen door.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been here before.\\n\\n I remember.\\n\\n Kitchen all neat.\\n\\n Shelves, pantry, cupboards.\\n\\n All neat, nice.\\n\\n Copper keeps it nice.\\n\\n In the kitchen window, a ceramic sign.\\n\\n It\u0027s dark, I can\u0027t read it.\\n\\n I remember, though:\\n\\n WHOEVER DIES WITH THE MOST THINGS, WINS.\\n\\n I rest my fingers on Copper\u0027s oak table.\\n\\n I pass the cellar door by the pantry.\\n\\n I walk down the hallway.\\n\\n The quilt is not on the wall.\\n\\n I touch the wall.\\n\\n I leave a little stain on the wall.\\n\\n I walk down the hallway.\\n\\n I find Copper in the living room.\\n\\n I find Copper in the front room, on his chair.\\n\\n There are six blankets over him, all askew.\\n\\n There are six blankets and a quilt over Copper.\\n\\n Becca\u0027s quilt is bundled close to his neck.\\n\\n Cloth houses on the cloth street, bundled around Copper\u0027s neck.\\n\\n Cloth Copper on his cloth rocker on his cloth porch.\\n\\n Cloth Copper with a stain on his cloth clothes.\\n\\n I put that stain there.\\n\\n There\u0027s a fresh stain over mine.\\n\\n A stain from Copper\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n A reddish, ruddy stain.\\n\\n Copper sits in his chair.\\n\\n Copper, wrapped in the cloth houses and cloth street and cloth neighbors and cloth Copper in his cloth rocker on his cloth porch.\\n\\n Six blankets and the cloth neighborhood didn\u0027t keep him warm.\\n\\n Six blankets and a quilt, but how to cover oneself when you can\u0027t feel your fingers?\\n\\n Six blankets and a quilt, but it\u0027s not enough, and it doesn\u0027t quite do the trick.\\n\\n Six blankets and a quilt, but one leg is bare between the top of the sock and edge of the pant leg, its crease gone.\\n\\n The bare skin is blue-white.\\n\\n Copper is blue-white, his skin the color of his eyes.\\n\\n Under the blankets, his right hand is wrapped over his left wrist, his left hand clutching his right wrist, his fingers locked over wrists like dead crow feet.\\n\\n The cold bit deep this time, deeper than deep.\\n\\n Copper\u0027s face is waxed, his jaw fixed cocked to the side, his lower gums bared, mouth slightly open.\\n\\n A light frost bristles on his lips, spiking from his unshaven chin, whiter than the paraffin-white of his skin.\\n\\n The frost continues down onto the cloth Copper on his cloth rocker on his cloth porch.\\n\\n Copper\u0027s spider-leg eyebrows crook upward over his nose, frozen in surprise.\\n\\n I remember dying in the Baker basement.\\n\\n It was cold.\\n\\n Copper hates the cold.\\n\\n Copper hates the cold, but it still took him by surprise, a slow, steely revelation of how bad it really had become, could be, was, is.\\n\\n It took Copper hard.\\n\\n It hurt.\\n\\n It took a long fucking time, and it fucking hurt; it hurt bad.\\n\\n The cold took him and his and all he still had and all he\u0027d been.\\n\\n Took it hard.\\n\\n I sit and watch.\\n\\n I sit and watch Copper.\\n\\n I watch him until he\u0027s watching me.\\n\\n I watch his eyes trade one glaze for another, just like when I watched Fetus when his eyes did the same thing.\\n\\n When was that?\\n\\n I can\u0027t remember.\\n\\n I watch Copper\u0027s brow furrow, his milky blues go from watching nothing to watching something to eventually taking me in.\\n\\n \u0027It hurt, didn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Copper straightens his jaw.\\n\\n His jaw pops, and he works it back and forth.\\n\\n \u0027The cold, I mean.\u0027\\n\\n He closes his mouth and purses his lips, testing them, like an infant.\\n\\n \u0027It really fucking hurt, didn\u0027t it, old man?\u0027\\n\\n Copper glares at me.\\n\\n \u0027No need for language, kid.\u0027\\n\\n Turns out Fetus and I were right.\\n\\n Turns out Copper is just what we need:\\n\\n A commanding officer.\\n\\n Copper takes command.\\n\\n Copper knows the neighborhood.\\n\\n Turns out Copper knows more than this neighborhood.\\n\\n Copper knows more than this burb.\\n\\n Turns out Copper knows most of the city.\\n\\n Turns out Copper has maps and charts and floor plans.\\n\\n \u0027How do you remember all this?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027Worked in just about every nook and cranny at some point, kid.\u0027\\n\\n Copper winks at me when he says it.\\n\\n \u0027What I didn\u0027t work, my brother-in law did.\u0027\\n\\n Copper reprimands us for thinking small.\\n\\n Copper has plans.\\n\\n Copper has plans and makes plans.\\n\\n Copper is in command.\\n\\n Copper sets up his command outpost in his own basement.\\n\\n Copper doesn\u0027t flinch at the basement door.\\n\\n Copper leads us all downstairs.\\n\\n Basement is clean, neat, tidy. Like the whole house.\\n\\n Copper spreads out the floor plans and the street plans, and Copper looks and makes marks and asks questions and looks some more.\\n\\n Copper calls Fetus and Stout and Shiner and McFay and those two amputees and me in for a powwow.\\n\\n He lays it all out and we drink it all in and we sit real quiet for a long time and think about it, and we sit real quiet.\\n\\n Copper calls Shiner and Fetus in with state maps.\\n\\n Copper has big plans.\\n\\n I stop dreaming about Mount McKinley.\\n\\n I can\u0027t remember Mount McKinley any more.\\n\\n I wake up on the cot Copper provides and I make my bed.\\n\\n I fold the corners the way I was taught in -\\n\\n I can\u0027t remember.\\n\\n Copper reminds me.\\n\\n I remember dying in the Baker house basement.\\n\\n Now I\u0027m in Copper\u0027s basement.\\n\\n It\u0027s nice.\\n\\n Copper brings us LED lights.\\n\\n Copper brings in stuff to read.\\n\\n It\u0027s nice.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember the cold.\\n\\n I remember how to make my bed.\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember Mount McKinley.\\n\\n Copper stays put on his porch, day after day, and watches.\\n\\n Copper watches the cops drive by when they bother to drive by at all, and they don\u0027t wave, and Copper doesn\u0027t wave.\\n\\n Copper doesn\u0027t cup his wrists in his hands any more, because Copper doesn\u0027t feel the cold any more.\\n\\n Nobody knows Copper doesn\u0027t feel the cold, no more than anyone knows how badly he felt it over his long, slow passing back in March, except for me.\\n\\n Copper watches, and nobody knows any better.\\n\\n Nobody is watching.\\n\\n Nobody cares.\\n\\n Copper is watching.\\n\\n Copper cares.\\n\\n Copper sees T drive by.\\n\\n Copper watches T drive by.\\n\\n T doesn\u0027t turn his head.\\n\\n Copper doesn\u0027t wave.\\n\\n Copper and Shiner go away for -\\n\\n I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n I remember how to make my bed.\\n\\n I sit on Copper\u0027s porch but never in his rocker.\\n\\n I look out the Baker-house basement window.\\n\\n I remember Copper.\\n\\n Copper and Shiner come back in a pickup truck with two other men.\\n\\n Copper and Shiner meet with the men for I don\u0027t know how long.\\n\\n Copper and Shiner put away the state maps and the map of the United States and call me and Stout and McFay in.\\n\\n \u0027Pack your gear, we\u0027re moving out next week, kid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll miss you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no, you\u0027re coming too.\u0027\\n\\n Copper winks.\\n\\n \u0027New detail.
