{"id":100952,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"BY KELLEY ARMSTRONG\n Daniel Boyd had overcome many obstacles in his life, and mortality was simply the latest challenge. He\u0027d been born into an illustrious family of sorcerers, own - ers of a multinational corporation. Money and magical powers. The proverbial silver spoon . . . or it would be, if your father hadn\u0027t screwed the company over and gotten himself - and his sons - disinherited. But Daniel had surmounted that barrier, and so he would with this one.\n \u0027We\u0027re heading down to the laboratory,\u0027 Shana said, her voice coming through his computer speaker. \u0027It\u0027s underground, so let\u0027s hope we don\u0027t lose the connection.\u0027\n They\u0027d better not, considering how much Daniel had paid for the equipment. He leaned back and watched the screen bob as Shana descended the steps, the camera affixed to her hand.\n The doctor had given him the death sentence two weeks ago. Inoperable cancer. Six months to live. Daniel didn\u0027t accept it. He had money, he had power, he had connections; he would find a way to commute this sentence. So he\u0027d begun his search, delving in the black market of the supernatural world.\n Shana finally reached the underground Peruvian laboratory. As much as Daniel wanted this cure, he wasn\u0027t flitting across the world to get it. There was no need to when he had Shana.\n She was, as he\u0027d always said, the perfect assistant. Loyal enough to follow orders without question. Astute enough to anticipate his every need. Attractive enough to make everyone presume he was bedding her, and smart enough never to correct that presumption.\n She\u0027d been with him for six years, and he didn\u0027t know what he\u0027d do without her. Luckily, he didn\u0027t need to worry about that.\n \u0027Still there, sir?\u0027 Shana asked.\n \u0027I am. Audio and visual working fine.\u0027\n A man\u0027s face filled the screen, coffee-stained teeth flashing. \u0027Hola, Mr Boyd! I\u0027m delighted that you\u0027ve taken an interest in my studies. May I be the first to welcome you to-\u0027\n \u0027I have a meeting in twenty minutes.\u0027\n \u0027Of course. You\u0027re a busy man. I mustn\u0027t keep you-\u0027\n \u0027No, you mustn\u0027t,\u0027 Shana said. \u0027Now, this is the lab, I take it?\u0027\n The camera panned a gleaming, high-tech laboratory. Dr Gonzales was funded by a European cabal that wouldn\u0027t appreciate him double-dipping with another client, but he\u0027d been unable to resist Daniel\u0027s offer.\n Gonzales walked to a table full of beakers and tubes and started explaining how he\u0027d distilled the genetic component.\n \u0027Not interested,\u0027 Daniel said. \u0027I only care about the end result.\u0027\n \u0027You can send the results to me,\u0027 Shana said. \u0027So our scientists can check your procedures.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, of course. Well, then, on to the subjects.\u0027\n The screen dimmed as they returned to the hallway. Daniel answered three e-mails while they walked and talked about the cure. It wasn\u0027t a cure for cancer; Daniel had realized early that was a Band-Aid solution to avoid tackling the underlying problem of mortality.\n Vampirism seemed the best solution. Semi-immortality plus invulnerability. But as it turned out, the process of becoming one was far more convoluted than he\u0027d expected and promised only a 20 percent chance of success . . . and an 80 percent risk of complete annihilation of life and soul.\n Most vampires, though, were hereditary, and therein he believed lay the answer. After some digging, he finally found a lead on Gonzales, a shaman who claimed to have isolated and distilled the genetic component that would make anyone a vampire, for the right price.\n \u0027Sir?\u0027 Shana murmured.\n He glanced at the screen to see what looked like a hospital ward. He counted eight subjects, varying ages, all on their backs, unconscious, hooked up to banks of monitors.\n \u0027We began clinical trials five years ago, starting with rhesus monkeys-\u0027\n \u0027Could you tell us about these subjects, please,\u0027 Shana cut in. \u0027Have they completed the trial? How much attrition did you experience? Have you managed to induce invulnerability as well as semi-immortality?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027ve all completed the procedure. We had two subjects whose bodies rejected the infusion. One survived. One did not. As for invulnerability, naturally, that is part of the package-\u0027\n Gonzales stopped as Shana stepped up to a sleeping subject.\n \u0027-though it hasn\u0027t been perfected yet,\u0027 he hurried on. \u0027It will be, though.\u0027\n Shana wrote something on her tablet notebook. Sweat trickled down Gonzales\u0027s cheek.\n \u0027Why are they unconscious?\u0027 she asked, still writing.\n \u0027We had some difficulty finding willing subjects, and while I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be pleased with the results, we thought it best to . . .\u0027\n \u0027Ease them into the reality of their new life.\u0027\n His head bobbed. \u0027Yes. Exactly. Thank you.\u0027\n \u0027Wake one up.\u0027\n Gonzales stared at her. Then he looked into the camera. \u0027When Ms Bergin speaks, she is speaking for me,\u0027 Daniel said.\n Gonzales blathered on about the danger of reversing an induced coma. Shana set the camera down so he could speak directly to Daniel, then she walked away, as if giving them privacy. She walked behind Gonzales, quietly opened a medical cabinet, took out a syringe, and scanned the bottles before choosing one. Daniel smiled. The perfect assistant. Always resourceful. Always anticipating his needs.\n As Gonzales continued, Shana filled the syringe, stepped up to the nearest subject, and plunged it in.\n The man bolted upright, gasping and wild-eyed. Not unexpected, under the circumstances. The screams were. Unearthly shrieks filled the lab as the man grabbed at his skin, fingers and nails digging in, ripping, blood splattering the white bed, the white walls. Gonzales radioed for help as he ran to the medicine cabinet.\n Shana walked over to the camera, then glanced back at the subject, still screaming and rending his flesh as if acid flowed through his veins.\n \u0027Well, now we know why they were sedated,\u0027 she said, and turned off the camera.\n One didn\u0027t reach Daniel\u0027s position in life by giving up easily. Yet neither did one get there by clinging to hope past all reasonable bounds. He spent another month researching promises of vampire life, then gave up on that particular cure.\n \u0027They\u0027ve been making huge strides in zombification lately,\u0027 Wendell said, between bites of his Kobe burger. Wendell was Daniel\u0027s second cousin, a VP in the family cabal. Relations with his family had greatly improved a decade ago, coinciding with his own company\u0027s appearance on the NYSE. An independently successful Boyd could be useful to the cabal, and Daniel felt the same about them.\n Wendell swiped the linen napkin across his mouth. \u0027Did you hear what I said?\u0027\n \u0027I heard. I\u0027m ignoring it, having no overwhelming desire to spend my eternity in a state of decomposition.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, you don\u0027t rot forever. Eventually the flesh is gone and you\u0027re a walking skeleton.\u0027 He leaned over to thump Daniel\u0027s shoulder. \u0027I\u0027m kidding. Well, not about the rotting part, but for years, scientists have been working on curing that little drawback. We had our own R \u0026 D department working on it for a while, before we decided it was simpler to monitor the independent guys, wait until they\u0027re done, then buy the research.\u0027\n \u0027For zombies?\u0027 Daniel\u0027s lip curled with distaste. The server - thinking he didn\u0027t like his meal - rushed over, but he waved her away.\n \u0027Sure. Think of the applications. We\u0027ve got a lawyer on his deathbed right now. Guy\u0027s been with us almost fifty years. A wealth of information is about to disappear. We could change that.\u0027\n \u0027Huh.\u0027 Daniel tore off a chunk of bread and chewed it slowly. \u0027You have any names?\u0027\n \u0027Not on hand. I can get them. If this works, though?\u0027 Wendell smiled. \u0027Biggest favor ever.\u0027\n Biggest favor ever was right. Savvy businessman that he was, Wendell had known exactly how much his information was worth. If it worked, he wanted a new job - with Daniel\u0027s corporation. That was fine. Wendell would make a good addition to the firm. Besides, if he had a stake in Daniel\u0027s continued survival, he\u0027d make damned sure he gave him every contact the Boyd Cabal had. Plus, if it worked, he\u0027d be able to swoop in and snatch up the research from under the cabal\u0027s nose, in which case, Wendell wouldn\u0027t have a job anyway . . . and might be in need of the immortality solution himself.\n Wendell got Daniel the names, and Shana started making the appointments. The first was with a whiz kid half-demon who\u0027d recently parted ways with a renowned researcher and had accidentally walked out with the man\u0027s work, which he\u0027d refined and was now prepared to sell.\n Daniel sat in the boardroom as the kid gave his spiel, Shana hurrying him along with reminders that Mr Boyd was a very busy man.\n \u0027Your time is valuable,\u0027 the kid said. \u0027Especially now, huh?\u0027\n He grinned. Daniel and Shana remained stone-faced.\n \u0027I believe you brought a test subject?\u0027 Shana said. \u0027One you have successfully transformed into a zombie.\u0027\n \u0027Right. Yes. He\u0027s in the . . . Just hold on.\u0027\n The kid hurried from the room and returned with another college-age kid. He walked a little slowly, and his face was paler than Daniel liked, but at this point, he wasn\u0027t being fussy.\n \u0027How long has it been since you turned him?\u0027 Shana asked.\n \u0027Three months.\u0027\n \u0027Any side effects?\u0027\n \u0027His reflexes are a little slow, but we\u0027re working on that.\u0027\n Shana motioned for the subject to turn. He did a 180.\n \u0027He\u0027s breathing,\u0027 she said.\n The whiz kid smiled. \u0027Yep. Breathing, got a pulse, eats, drinks, just like a living person.\u0027\n \u0027Impressive.\u0027\n \u0027Does he talk?\u0027 Daniel asked.\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 the zombie said. \u0027What do you want me to say?\u0027\n \u0027Recite the multiplication tables, starting at six.\u0027\n As the zombie performed, Shana eased behind them and removed a gun from her purse. She hesitated, just a second, but at a look from Daniel she nodded and shot the zombie in the back. He fell, gasping and clutching his chest. The whiz kid stared, then dropped to his knees beside his subject, who was bleeding out on the floor, eyes glazing over.\n \u0027Not a zombie,\u0027 Daniel said. \u0027Next time, Shana?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll ask for a demonstration of resurrection.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you.\u0027\n \u0027Is the lighting adequate, sir?\u0027 Shana asked.\n She swept the camera around the dark cemetery. The image jittered as she shivered. November really wasn\u0027t the best time for such things, but she hadn\u0027t complained, of course.\n \u0027Doctor Albright is-\u0027 she began.\n The shower turned on in his hotel suite\u0027s adjoining bathroom, drowning her out. Daniel glowered, then scooped up the portable screen and moved into the sitting room. The girl in the bathroom called out, asking if he wanted to join her. He closed the door and settled onto the sofa, then asked Shana to repeat herself.\n \u0027Doctor Albright is setting up at the gravesite. I\u0027m heading there now.\u0027\n A yelp, as she tripped over a half-buried gravestone.\n \u0027Careful, Shana. That equipment is very expensive.\u0027\n \u0027Y-yes, sir,\u0027 she said through chattering teeth.\n \u0027Get yourself a stiff drink when you finish,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027ll warm you up. Bill the company.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027\n He smiled. Little things, but crucial in employee relations. Even watching the screen made him chilly. He reached over and jacked up the heat on the gas fireplace, then poured himself a brandy.\n He turned up the sound as the girl in the bathroom yelled for the shampoo. He supposed she had a name, but he couldn\u0027t remember it. Not as if he planned to. Just another young woman in a bar, who\u0027d assessed the cut of his suit and spread her legs, a Pavlovian response to the smell of money.\n Shana finally found Albright. Along with two assistants, he\u0027d begun digging up a recent grave. It was long, cold work, and partway through, Daniel had to turn off the screen and bid farewell to the girl. Apparently, she\u0027d expected to stay the night and complained bitterly about being sent out with wet hair, so he\u0027d handed her the suite\u0027s blow-dryer and hurried her out the door with a couple hundred bucks \u0027for the taxi\u0027.\n By then they\u0027d dug down to the casket and were waiting for him, all shivering now, breath steaming in the air.\n \u0027I\u0027ve resurrected the corpse inside,\u0027 Albright announced, talking loudly to be heard over the muffled bangs and cries.\n \u0027Mr Boyd can hear that,\u0027 Shana said. \u0027Now, the ritual you used is supposed to return the body to its original form, free of any aftereffects of death, correct?\u0027\n \u0027Absolutely, as you will see in a moment.\u0027\n The assistants opened the casket. The man inside jerked, all limbs flailing, then sat up, gulping breaths of air before frowning, as if only just realizing he didn\u0027t need those breaths. He squinted up at the people surrounding his casket.\n \u0027Wh-what\u0027s going on?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027You\u0027ve been resurrected, Mr Lang. Congratulations.\u0027\n The man\u0027s frown deepened as he seemed to consider this. Then he nodded and tried to stand. Shana motioned to Albright, who stopped him. Shana ran her tests, confirming he did, indeed, appear to be dead. Or undead, as it were.\n She took out a folder and consulted a list.\n \u0027And you are James Lang, who died in an automobile accident on February twentieth?\u0027\n He nodded.\n \u0027You\u0027re sure?\u0027\n \u0027Course I\u0027m sure.\u0027\n She plucked out a sheet of paper and showed it to him. \u0027Because you don\u0027t look like Mr Lang. And I noticed, Dr Albright, that you began digging before I arrived, contrary to our agreement.\u0027\n \u0027I knew it would take a while and it\u0027s a cold night-\u0027\n \u0027I appreciate your consideration. I do not appreciate your duplicity. You started because you wanted to disguise any indication of recent digging; perhaps to lay a fresh zombie in Mr Lang\u0027s grave.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t-\u0027\n \u0027Then you won\u0027t mind me returning Mr Lang to our offices, where he can be monitored for signs of decomposition. \u0027 She turned to the zombie. \u0027Don\u0027t worry. Having skipped the embalming phase, it shouldn\u0027t take long.\u0027\n As expected, the zombie rotted and, in the meantime, Daniel knocked three more names off the list Wendell had provided, grumbling each time he did so, well aware that his cousin seemed to be getting the best of this deal. If Daniel succeeded, Wendell got a cushy new job. If he failed, Wendell could go to the cabal board of directors and tell them he\u0027d used Daniel to cull their list of zombification experts.\n Of the five rejected so far, only the whiz kid seemed to be a career con man. The rest were serious researchers, seriously researching the subject but years from selling a perfected cure. So, like all scientists - desperate for that big windfall that would let them continue their work - they tried to trick him into funding their work. He understood, though that didn\u0027t mean they hadn\u0027t paid dearly for the mistake.\n Two more researchers came and went, and Daniel was nearing the end of the list, when one at the bottom, perhaps hearing rumors, took it upon himself to make the initial contact. He came; he requested an audience; he was refused; he stayed. When Daniel left work, the man was still there. When he returned the next morning, he was still there. Daniel decided he could find a few minutes to hear the man out. And a few minutes was all it took, because the man followed Shana into Daniel\u0027s office and announced, \u0027I don\u0027t have the cure you\u0027re looking for.\u0027\n Shana sighed and started ushering him out, murmuring apologies to Daniel, but the man stood his ground and said, \u0027I don\u0027t have it, but I can get it. I\u0027m just missing one crucial ingredient.\u0027\n \u0027Money,\u0027 Daniel said, leaning back. \u0027Lots and lots of money.\u0027\n The man gave a strange little smile, almost patronizing. \u0027No, Mr Boyd. I have many investors. What I lack are test subjects. Seems there aren\u0027t a lot of people willing to die in hopes of being reborn in a rotting corpse.\u0027\n When Daniel didn\u0027t respond, the man took that as encouragement and stepped forward, opening his briefcase on Daniel\u0027s desk. He took out a folder the size of War and Peace.\n \u0027My project to date. I\u0027m asking you to take this and have your scientists go through it. My work, I believe, will speak for itself. All I need is someone to provide me with an unlimited supply of test subjects.\u0027\n \u0027Unlimited?\u0027 Shana said.\n \u0027My projections suggest I need between ten and fifty, depending on the number of stages required to perfect the serum. That is, however, an estimate at this point. More may be needed.\u0027\n \u0027More than fifty?\u0027 Shana caught Daniel\u0027s look and dropped her gaze, an apology on her lips. She stepped back.\n Daniel took the file. He leafed through it. For show, of course. In high school, he\u0027d blackmailed a fellow student to get him passing grades in science.\n \u0027Leave your card with Ms Bergin. I\u0027ll get back to you.\u0027\n Two days later, Daniel had Shana call and tell the man - Dr Boros - that he\u0027d get his test subjects, with a cap of fifty. Not that Daniel really intended to cut him off at fifty, but one had to set limits. And it placated Shana, which was, admittedly, important. He couldn\u0027t afford to lose her now.\n Within a week, Boros had the first subjects ready for Daniel\u0027s inspection.\n \u0027They aren\u0027t nearly at the stage you need,\u0027 Boros said into the camera. \u0027But I want complete transparency, Mr Boyd. You can see how far I\u0027ve progressed and how far I need to go. No charlatans\u0027 tricks. I believe you\u0027ve had enough of those?\u0027\n \u0027I have.\u0027\n Boros clearly wasn\u0027t putting his money into his laboratory - a shabby set of basement rooms. It was clean and the equipment was top-notch but hardly the high-tech, gleaming lab such experiments should have.\n Boros also lacked assistants. Again, not for want of funds, but in this case, apparently, because of understandable paranoia. He trusted only one young man, a fellow scientist and fellow necromancer. Daniel understood the sentiment: he felt the same about Shana. But more staff would mean faster results, and at this stage, with only three months to go, Daniel desperately needed fast.\n Boros\u0027s assistant brought in the first subject . . . strapped down on a gurney. Shana\u0027s sigh whispered across the audio connection.\n \u0027At least he\u0027s conscious,\u0027 she murmured to Daniel.\n \u0027This subject has been zombified for a week, and if Ms Bergin would care to examine him, she\u0027ll see no signs of decomposition. However, we have another problem.\u0027\n Shana waved at the restraints. \u0027He\u0027s unstable?\u0027\n \u0027In a manner of speaking.\u0027\n The assistant undid the restraints. The man lay there, blinking at the ceiling.\n \u0027Rise,\u0027 Boros said.\n The man didn\u0027t move. He should have: zombies had to obey the necromancer who resurrected them.\n \u0027Well, you\u0027ve cured the control aspect,\u0027 Daniel said. \u0027Thankfully.\u0027\n \u0027Actually, I haven\u0027t. On examining his brain activity, it seems he would respond, if he could. In attempting to remove the necromancer\u0027s control, it seems he has lost all control.\u0027\n As if in response, a wet spot spread across the subject\u0027s pants.\n \u0027That\u0027s a problem,\u0027 Daniel said.\n A small smile. \u0027I suspected you\u0027d say that.\u0027 Boros waved, and his assistant brought in the second subject. To Daniel\u0027s relief, this one was walking. He was also leaving a trail of decomposing flesh, falling like dandruff in his wake.\n \u0027That too is a problem,\u0027 Daniel said.\n \u0027Agreed.\u0027\n Boros turned to the subject. \u0027Clap three times.\u0027\n The man only looked at him.\n \u0027Touch your toes.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 the man asked.\n Boros stepped between the two subjects. \u0027In one, I\u0027ve stopped decomposition at the expense of bodily control. In the other, I\u0027ve freed him of the necromancer\u0027s control while accelerating decomp. Which problem would you like me to solve first? I know you\u0027d like me to work on both, but my resources here-\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not working there any more. Your study is coming here. I\u0027m clearing my laboratory and putting my specialists under your control.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d really rather not-\u0027\n \u0027You will. Or you don\u0027t have a client. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me-\u0027\n \u0027Sir?\u0027 Shana cut in. \u0027The . . .\u0027 She paused and motioned for the assistant to remove the test subjects. When they were gone, she turned to Boros. \u0027Can they be saved?\u0027\n Boros shook his head. \u0027One will remain in a permanent state of complete paralysis. The other will continue to rapidly decompose.\u0027\n \u0027So they\u0027ll be terminated? Humanely?\u0027\n \u0027Not so fast,\u0027 Daniel said. \u0027If there\u0027s still something to be learned from them, keep them.\u0027\n \u0027But-\u0027 Shana began.\n \u0027Bring them to the lab. There\u0027s a storage room we can use. We\u0027ll keep them there.\u0027\n He flicked off the screen.\n Within two months, Boros was getting so close to a cure that Daniel started postponing his visits to the doctor. Cancer wasn\u0027t going to be a death sentence, not for him. Even if it ravaged his body tomorrow, Boros was far enough along that Daniel could take the temporary cure and then wait out the final one.\n He didn\u0027t know how many subjects they\u0027d gone through. Shana kept him updated every week, when Boros put in his requisition, but he paid no attention. It was during one of those weekly updates that she said, \u0027We can\u0027t keep this up, sir. He\u0027s demanding ten more in the next week. There\u0027s a limit to how many transients can disappear from a city before someone starts investigating-\u0027\n \u0027Then send the team to another city.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re doing that. But it\u0027s a slow process. He needs healthy, clean subjects. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find them among that population? We test them, but he still rejects a third of the ones-\u0027\n \u0027Then we need to come up with an alternative.\u0027\n A soft sigh of relief. \u0027Thank you, sir. Now, I\u0027ve done the calculations, and if you were to take his cure in its present form, we could slow the testing, meaning we could cut back the number of subjects significantly and-\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not taking a substandard cure unless it\u0027s an absolute last resort.\u0027\n \u0027I understand, sir, but we are reaching that stage-\u0027\n \u0027No, we aren\u0027t. I want you to comb through the employee files. Find anyone with a terminal illness. Offer two years\u0027 salary to their families in return for their participation. Emphasize the benefits of the procedure and minimize the side effects.\u0027\n When she didn\u0027t answer, he looked up from his computer golf game. She was staring at him.\n \u0027Employees, sir?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what I said. If we don\u0027t have enough with a terminal illness, make it a general offer and increase it to triple salary.\u0027\n She continued to stare.\n \u0027How\u0027s Lindsey, Shana?\u0027\n She blanched. When Shana came into his employ, her eleven-year-old daughter had been suffering from a rare liver disease, on a transplant list and failing fast. As her signing bonus, Shana got that liver for her daughter and all the care she\u0027d needed to make a full recovery. And Daniel got the perfect assistant - one indebted to him for life.\n \u0027I-I think we can fill this latest requisition with transients, \u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll split the team and send them farther afield.\u0027\n He smiled. \u0027Thank you, Shana.\u0027\n She started to leave. He called her back and handed her a check for ten thousand dollars.\n \u0027A bonus. Buy something special for yourself and Lindsey.\u0027\n She stared at it, and, for just a second, he thought she was going to hand it back. After only that brief hesitation, though, she murmured, \u0027Thank you, sir,\u0027 pocketed it, and left.\n Finally, the day came. And not a moment too soon, as Daniel struggled to get into work every day, ignoring his wife\u0027s nervous clucking, ignoring the little voice inside himself that said, \u0027Take the cure as it is, before it\u0027s too late.\u0027 Boros was close, though, and Daniel willed himself to hang on. The pain and exhaustion were simply more obstacles to overcome.\n And then it was ready.\n Daniel made Boros go through the final stage twice - two batches with four subjects each time. When he was assured of the results, he ordered six of those subjects killed, the other two left alive and stored for long-term monitoring and potential future tests. He wasn\u0027t sure what Shana objected to more - killing successful subjects or holding the other two captive. He had assured her, though, that once he\u0027d been treated, all the failures could be terminated and sent on to their afterlives. That satisfied her.\n Killing the successful subjects and keeping two for testing was but one of the precautions he took. He knew he was heading into the most dangerous phase of the testing. He was about to die and put his rebirth in the hands of others. It would be the final test of loyalty for his assistant, and while he trusted her more than anyone in his life, he took precautions with that too, guaranteeing she wouldn\u0027t decide at the last moment that he could stay dead.\n Then he let Boros kill him by lethal injection. Not pleasant but, according to his research, the quickest and most reliable method. The next thing he saw was Shana\u0027s face, floating above his, her pretty features drawn with concern, worrying that the cure might have failed. While he\u0027d like to think she was worried for his sake, he knew better.\n \u0027Sir?\u0027 she said, when he opened his eyes.\n He blinked hard. \u0027Yes?\u0027 He had to say it twice. When he spoke, the relief on her face . . . there was a moment there when he wished it was for him.\n He tried to sit up. She helped him. She gave him a glass of water. She wiped his face, made him feel more himself, and he was grateful.\n Daniel had undergone surgery a couple of times in his youth, and this reminded him of that, coming out of the anesthetic, slow and groggy. Boros bustled around, administering tests, checking his reflexes and responses to visual and audio stimuli. Shana kept him comfortable.\n At last, Boros declared the conversion a success. He had Daniel get up and move around, do a few tasks on his laptop, make sure his physical and mental capacities were normal.\n \u0027All right, then,\u0027 Boros said. \u0027Go back to bed.\u0027\n Daniel didn\u0027t want to go back to bed. He felt fine and he needed to relocate to the safe room in the basement, where he\u0027d remain for a few days, presumably \u0027on vacation\u0027 until he was fully recovered.\n When he tried opening his mouth to refuse, though, he couldn\u0027t. Instead, he found himself walking back to the bed. And, as he lay down, he realized with no small amount of horror that he\u0027d been tricked.\n Boros walked over. \u0027Did you really think I\u0027d give up the chance to have a man like yourself as my personal puppet?\u0027\n Daniel started to sit up.\n \u0027Lie down.\u0027\n He did.\n Boros smiled. \u0027Yes, I know, you checked and rechecked, making sure I gave you the right formulation. And I did. You can ask Ms Bergin. Unfortunately, it appears there is no way to remove the control a necromancer has over his zombies.\u0027\n \u0027But-\u0027\n \u0027I know, I demonstrated it to you. With subjects raised by my assistant, meaning they would have no reason to obey me.\u0027\n Daniel tried to look at Shana, but she\u0027d disappeared behind Boros.\n \u0027Don\u0027t bother appealing to her. She\u0027s been paid well for her cooperation. Yes, you\u0027re holding a chit on her, but considering that you\u0027re under my control, that\u0027s a problem easily remedied. So let\u0027s start there. Please release-\u0027\n The muffled hiss of a silenced gunshot cut him short. Boros slumped forward, a small-caliber bullet through the back of his head. Shana was behind him with a gun. As Boros lay on the floor, blood oozing down his balding scalp, Daniel sat up, slowly, eyes on the barrel. She lowered it to her side.\n \u0027I trust you\u0027ll make that call now, sir?\u0027 she said.\n He did, having her daughter released, then giving the phone to Shana. Out of Daniel\u0027s earshot she spoke to her daughter.\n \u0027You\u0027ll be well compensated-\u0027 he began when she returned, and for the first time since they\u0027d met, she interrupted him.\n \u0027I know. I\u0027ll be very well compensated. And, as soon as I\u0027ve set you up in the safe room, my employment is at an end.\u0027\n He understood and said as much. She called a pair of guards to come for Boros\u0027s body and to detain his assistant. Then she called in two shamans who\u0027d been part of the research team and, as such, knew Daniel\u0027s secret and would be tending to him during his recovery. The four of them set off for the room that would be his temporary home.\n \u0027There\u0027s one last thing I\u0027ll ask,\u0027 Shana said, as they took the elevator to the basement. \u0027You promised to release the other subjects-\u0027\n \u0027Excluding the two successes. I may still need them.\u0027\n She nodded. \u0027The others, though . . .\u0027\n \u0027. . . can have their souls released immediately. And there won\u0027t be any more. I presume that\u0027s why you killed Boros?\u0027\n She nodded, and he felt a small prickle of disappointment. Had he really thought she\u0027d done it to protect him?\n She handed him a form authorizing the subjects\u0027 release. He arched his brows, surprised at the formality, but she met his gaze with a level stare. She didn\u0027t trust him, and he\u0027d earned that mistrust, so there was nothing to do now but make a clean break of it. When they reached the basement lab, she faxed the signed forms to the records department.\n Outside the safe room, Shana slid her card through the reader, coupled with a retinal scan. The electronic door whooshed open. Daniel walked in and looked around. He hadn\u0027t seen the work they\u0027d done to prepare it. He hadn\u0027t even told Shana what he\u0027d wanted. But it was exactly as he\u0027d expected - a storage room converted into a luxury hotel suite.\n The shamans hurried in to help him sit, then retreated behind Shana. She hadn\u0027t said a word since the elevator. He supposed he couldn\u0027t expect more, under the circumstances, so he made a call, wiring a million dollars into her account, and she waited in silence until she received confirmation on her cell phone. Then, with the shamans flanking her, she closed the door.\n Daniel was just settling onto the bed when the speaker overhead clicked on. It was Shana.\n \u0027The records department has received the fax on releasing the zombies. I\u0027m going to do that now, before I go.\u0027\n Daniel smiled. There was no need to tell him that, but it was obvious she couldn\u0027t bring herself to walk away. As angry as she was, she had a good job, and she\u0027d hoped - expected - he\u0027d try to convince her to stay.\n \u0027How much, Shana?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027Sir?\u0027\n \u0027To stay. What do you want? More money? A bigger office?\u0027 He chuckled. \u0027An assistant of your own?\u0027\n \u0027No, sir. I was simply calling to confirm that it\u0027s all right for me to release the zombies.\u0027\n He sighed. She was going to be difficult. \u0027Yes, yes. Release them. Now about-\u0027\n A whoosh cut him short. He glanced at the door. It was still shut.\n \u0027You!\u0027 snarled a voice behind him.\n He wheeled to see that a section of the wall had opened. One of the zombie subjects stood in the opening, squinting at him with its good eye, the other shriveled.\n \u0027You did this to me,\u0027 the zombie said, struggling to speak through rotting lips.\n \u0027No,\u0027 Daniel said slowly, carefully. \u0027A scientist-\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t even remember me, do you? But I remember you. Sitting there, barely paying attention, busy talking on your cell phone as you sentenced me to this.\u0027 He waved at his rotting body.\n Daniel looked up at the speaker. \u0027If this is your idea of a lesson, Shana-\u0027\n \u0027No, sir,\u0027 her voice crackled. \u0027This is my idea of a lesson.\u0027\n Another zombie appeared behind the first. Then a third, crawling on stubs of arms. A fourth slithered past him. They crowded into the doorway, grumbling and grunting, all glowering at Daniel. Then the first stepped aside, and they rushed forward, zombie after zombie, running, lurching, dragging themselves toward him.\n Daniel ran to the door. Pounded on it. Screamed.\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry, sir,\u0027 Shana said. \u0027Your procedure was a success. No matter what they do, you can\u0027t die.\u0027\n A click, and the speaker went silent as the zombies swarmed over him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology/page-6.html","bookId":2463,"book":{"id":2463,"title":"The New Dead: A Zombie Anthology","description":"Storyline: \n Resurrection! \n The hungry dead have risen.
