{"id":81270,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"BY JOE R . LANSDALE\n My daddy told me it wasn\u0027t a place I ought to be, because the owner, who had once been a good friend of his, and the owner\u0027s friends were troublesome, which was his way of saying they were no-accounts or hoods. My mother didn\u0027t want me there, either, but after high school, about twice a week, sometimes three times a week, me and my friends Donald and Lee would go over to the pool hall to shoot a few runs of Solids and Stripes, which was the only pool game we knew.\n I think what we liked about going there was that pool was thought of as a tough guy\u0027s game, a game played in bars with lots of cigarette and cigar smoke and some rough-looking characters hanging around. And that\u0027s just the way Rugger\u0027s Pool Hall was. I saw Jack Rugger and his friends at my father\u0027s garage from time to time, where my daddy kept their cars running. My daddy was no shrinking violet, either, but his strength and anger were generally of a positive sort and not directed at my person. Rugger and his pals were a mystery to me, because they talked about drinking and whoring and fighting and about how bad they were, and the thing was, I knew they weren\u0027t just bragging.\n I figured I was pretty bad myself, and so did Donald and Lee. They were my fan club. In school, with my six-three, two-hundred-pound frame, and the bulk of it weight-lifting muscles, I was respected. I had even, on occasion, gotten into fights outside of school with older, bigger college boys and whipped them. I had a few moves. I was always waiting for a chance to prove it.\n So, this time I\u0027m talking about, we walked over there from school to buy a couple of soda pops and shoot some pool and slip a cigarette and talk about girls and tail, like we\u0027d had any, and when we got there, Rugger\u0027s cousin, Ray Martin Winston, was there along with Rugger and a retarded kid who cleaned up and kept sodas in the soda machine. The kid always wore a red baseball cap and overalls, lived in the back, and Rugger usually referred to him as \u0027the retard\u0027. The kid went along with this without any kickback. He was as dedicated to Rugger as a seeing-eye dog, and about as concerned with day-to-day activities as a pig was about algebra.\n Ray Martin was older than we were, but not by much. Maybe three years. He had dropped out of school as soon as he could, and I had no idea what he did for a living, though it was rumored he stole and sold and ran a few whores, one of which was said to be his sister, though any of it could have been talk. He was a peculiar-looking fella, one of those who seem as if their lives will be about trouble, and that was Ray Martin. He was lean but not too tall, had a shock of blond hair, which he took great care to lightly oil and comb. It was his best feature. It was thick and fell down on his forehead in a Beach Boy kind of wave. His face always made me think of a hammerhead shark. It had to do with his beady black eyes and the way his nose dropped straight down from his thick forehead and along the length of his face until it stopped just above lips as thin as razor cuts. His chin looked like a block of stone. He had chunky white teeth, all them about the size of sugar cubes. He would have made a great Dick Tracy villain. He had a reptilian way of moving, or at least that\u0027s how it seemed to me, as if he undulated and squirmed. I guess in the back of my head there was a piece of me itching to find out just how dangerous he really was.\n We shot a game at our table, while Ray Martin shot alone at one of the other three, knocking the cue ball around, racking and breaking and taking shots. Free time had given him good aim and a good arm for the table.\n I was feeling my oats that day, and I looked over and said, \u0027You\u0027re pretty good playin\u0027 yourself.\u0027\n Ray Martin raised his head and twisted it, cracked his neck as he did, and gave me a look that I had never seen before. Rugger came over quickly with a beer from the cooler, handed it to him, and said, \u0027Ought to be someone comin\u0027 in pretty soon. Maybe you can get a game up.\u0027\n Ray Martin nodded, took the wet beer bottle, sipped it, and examined me with the precision of a sniper about to pop off a shot. \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027That could happen.\u0027\n He went over and sat in a chair by the wall and drank his beer and kept his eye on me, one hand in his baggy pants pocket. I turned back to the game, and Donald leaned over close and said, \u0027He didn\u0027t take that well. He thought it was some kind of crack.\u0027\n \u0027I meant it as a crack,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027I know. And he took it as a crack.\u0027\n \u0027You think I\u0027m worried?\u0027\n Donald\u0027s face changed a little. He licked his lips. I thought his lower jaw shook. \u0027No. I\u0027m not worried about you. I know you can take care of yourself.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t believe him altogether. I had seen that spark of doubt in his eyes, and it annoyed me. I didn\u0027t like him thinking I might not be as bad and tough as I thought I was. I saw the retarded kid glaring at me, his mouth hanging open, and it somehow hit me that the kid thought the same thing, though truth was, if that kid had two thoughts, they probably canceled each other out.\n I gave Ray Martin a glance, just to show him my ball sack hadn\u0027t shrunk, and his stare was still locked on me. I won\u0027t lie to you, I was feeling brave, but there was something about the way he looked at me that clawed its way down inside of me. I had never seen anyone with that kind of look, and I wrote it off to the way his face was and that no matter what he was thinking and no matter where he was looking, he\u0027d look like that. Hell, his old mother probably looked like that; she probably had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get fucked.\n I peeked at Rugger. He was looking at me, too, but with a different kind of look, like someone watching a dog darting across the highway in front of an eighteen-wheeler, wondering how it was going to turn out. I thought maybe he was hoping I\u0027d make it. When he and my father were kids, my daddy had been on his side in an oil-field fight that had become a kind of Marvel Creek legend. Him and dad against six others, and they had won, and in style, sending two of their foes to the hospital. I guess, through my dad, that gave me and the old man a kind of connection, though now that I look back on it, he wasn\u0027t that old. Probably in his forties then, balding, with a hard potbelly, arms that looked as if they had been pumped full of air, legs too short and thin for the bulk of his upper body - a barrel supported by reeds.\n This concern and Donald\u0027s doubt didn\u0027t set well with me, and it made me feel all the more feisty. I was about to say something smart to Ray Martin, when the front door opened and a man about thirty came in. He was wearing khaki pants and a plaid shirt and a blue-jean jacket and tie- up boots. He was as dark as Ray Martin was blond and pale. \u0027How\u0027re y\u0027all?\u0027 he said. He sounded like someone who had just that day stepped off the farm for the first time and had left his turnips outside. I looked out through the front door, which was glass with a roll-down curtain curled above it, and parked next to the curb I could see a shiny new Impala. It wasn\u0027t a car that looked like it went with the fella, but it was his.\n Rugger nodded at him, and the fella said, \u0027I was wonderin\u0027 you could tell me how to get to Tyler?\u0027 Rugger told him, and then the hick asked, \u0027You got any food to sell here?\u0027\n \u0027Some potato chips, peanuts,\u0027 Rugger said. \u0027Got a Coke machine. We don\u0027t fry no hamburgers or nothin\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027I guess I\u0027ll just have some peanuts then.\u0027\n Rugger went over and pulled a package off the rack, and the hick paid for them. He went to the Coke machine and lifted the lid and reached down in the cold water and threaded a cola through the little metal maze that led to where you pulled it out after putting in your money. You don\u0027t see those kinds of machines any more, but for a while, back in the sixties, they were pretty popular.\n He pulled the cap off with the opener on the side of the box and turned around and said, \u0027Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 like a store-bought Co-Cola,\u0027 as if there were any other kind. He swigged about half the drink in one gulp, pulled it down and wiped his mouth with his sleeve, and tore open his bag of peanuts with his teeth and poured them into the Coke bottle. The salt made the soda foam a little. He swigged that and chewed on the wet peanuts and came over and watched us play for a moment.\n \u0027I\u0027ve played this game,\u0027 he said, showing me some crunched peanuts on his teeth.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 I said. \u0027Well, we got a full table.\u0027\n \u0027I see that. I do. I\u0027m just sayin\u0027 I know how. My old pappy taught me how to play. I like it. I\u0027m pretty good too.\u0027\n \u0027Well, good for you,\u0027 I said. \u0027Did your old pappy teach you not to bother folks when they\u0027re playin\u0027?\u0027\n He smiled, looked a little wounded. \u0027Yes, he did. I apologize. \u0027\n \u0027Hey, you,\u0027 Ray Martin called.\n We all looked.\n \u0027You want to play some pool?\u0027 he said to the hayseed. \u0027I\u0027ll play you.\u0027\n \u0027Sure, I\u0027ll play,\u0027 the hayseed said, shrugging his shoulders. \u0027But I warn you, sometimes I like to play for nickels and such.\u0027\n Ray Martin stretched his razor-thin lips and grinned those sugar-cube teeth. \u0027That\u0027s all right, yokel. We\u0027ll play for such, as you call it.\u0027\n \u0027I reckon I am a bit of a yokel,\u0027 said the fella, \u0027but I prefer to be called Ross. That\u0027s what my old mama named me.\u0027\n \u0027Say she did?\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027All right, then, Ross, I\u0027ll ask you somethin\u0027. You know how to play anything other than Stripes and Solids? You shoot straight pool?\u0027\n \u0027I know how it\u0027s done,\u0027 Ross said.\n \u0027Good. Let\u0027s you and me knock \u0027em around.\u0027\n It wasn\u0027t a very exciting game. Ross got to break on the flip of a coin, and he managed to knock the cue ball in the hole right off, without so much as sending the ball\u0027s shadow in the direction of any of his targets.\n Ray Martin took his shoot, and he cleared about four balls before he missed. Ross shot one in with what looked like mostly a lucky shot, and then he missed, and then Ray Martin ran what was left. They had bet a dollar on the game, and Ross paid up.\n \u0027You\u0027re good,\u0027 Ross said.\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard that,\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027You want to go again?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \u0027Sure you do. You want to get that dollar back, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n Ross scratched the side of his nose then shifted his testicles with one hand, as if that would help him make a decision, and said, \u0027I reckon . . . Hell, all right. I\u0027ll bet you that dollar and two more.\u0027\n \u0027A high roller.\u0027\n \u0027I got paid; I can spare a little.\u0027\n Ray Martin grinned at him as if he were a wolf that had just found an injured rabbit caught up in the briars.\n By now we weren\u0027t shooting any more, just leaning against the wall watching them, not really knowing how to play straight pool but pretending we did, acting like we knew what was going on.\n The game results were similar to the first. Ray Martin chalked his cue while Ross dug a few bucks out of his wallet and paid up. Ray Martin called out, \u0027Hey, Retard, get over here and rack these balls. You keep them racked, I\u0027ll give you a quarter. You don\u0027t, I\u0027ll give you a kick in the ass.\u0027\n The retard racked the balls. Ross said, \u0027I don\u0027t know I want to play any more.\u0027\n \u0027Scared?\u0027 Ray Martin asked.\n \u0027Well, I know a better pool player when I see one.\u0027\n \u0027How about one more?\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027Just one more game and we\u0027ll throw in the towel.\u0027\n Ross pursed his lips and looked like he wished he were back on the farm, maybe fucking a calf.\n \u0027Hell, you can spare another two or three dollars, can\u0027t you?\u0027 Ray Martin said.\n \u0027I guess,\u0027 Ross said, and did that lip-pursing thing again. \u0027But I tell you what: you want to go another game, let\u0027s go ahead and play it bigger. I ain\u0027t been winnin\u0027, but I\u0027m gonna bet you can\u0027t do three in a row. My pappy always said bet on the third in a row \u0027cause that\u0027s your winner.\u0027\n \u0027He rich?\u0027 Ray Martin asked.\n \u0027Well, no,\u0027 Ross said.\n Ray Martin laughed a little, a sharp little laugh like a dog barking. \u0027That\u0027s all right; even someone mostly wrong has got to be right now and again.\u0027\n \u0027Very well, then,\u0027 Ross said, \u0027I\u0027m gonna trust my old pappy. I\u0027ll bet you . . . say, ten dollars.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s bold.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, and I\u0027m about to change my mind, now that I think about it.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027You made the offer.\u0027\n \u0027Now that I think about it, it was stupid of me,\u0027 Ross said. \u0027I guess I was feelin\u0027 kind of full of piss and vinegar. How about we drop it? My old pappy ain\u0027t even right when he says it\u0027s gonna rain.\u0027\n \u0027No. You\u0027re on. Retard\u0027s got \u0027em racked. Come on, country boy, let\u0027s shoot.\u0027\n Of course, when it got right down to it, we were all country boys, just some of us lived in town, as if in disguise, but this Ross, he was a regular turd knocker. He tried to get out of it, said, \u0027Heck, I\u0027ll pay you a dollar to forget it. I shouldn\u0027t have bet anything. I ain\u0027t really no bettin\u0027 kind of man. I\u0027m actin\u0027 bigger than my goldarn britches.\u0027\n \u0027You welchin\u0027 on a bet, mister?\u0027 Ray Martin said, and when he said it, he laid the pool cue on the table and stepped close to Ross. \u0027You welchin\u0027?\u0027\n \u0027No. I\u0027m not welchin\u0027. I\u0027m just tryin\u0027 to pay my way out so as I can get out cheaper.\u0027\n Ray Martin shook his head. \u0027Pick up your cue, farmer. You\u0027re in.\u0027\n Ross lost the coin toss on the break, and Ray Martin started out good, went for several shots before he missed. Ray Martin leaned on his pool cue then and looked smug. Ross picked up his cue, studied the table, shook his head, said, \u0027I\u0027ll give it a try.\u0027\n His first shot was a doozy. He busted two balls, and both of them went into pockets. He said, \u0027Now that\u0027s somethin\u0027. Even a blind hog finds an acorn now and then.\u0027 And then he started to shoot again. He didn\u0027t miss. Not one shot. When he finished, he looked up, surprised. \u0027Maybe my old pappy was right.\u0027\n Ray Martin paid Ross the money as if the bills he was peeling out of his wallet were strips of his own skin, and then he insisted on another game. Ross said he\u0027d had enough, that he\u0027d had a lucky run, but Ray Martin jumped the price up to fifty dollars, and after a bit of haggling, they went at it. Ross got the flip, and he started shooting. He didn\u0027t miss a shot, and once he even jumped the cue ball over another ball to make a shot. I\u0027d never seen anything like it. The way he moved then was different. There was a fluid sort of way he had of going around the table, nothing like the gangly moves he\u0027d shown before, and his face had changed as well: it was dark with concentration, and there was a sparkle in his eye, as if he were actually powered by electricity.\n When he was finished, he said, \u0027I\u0027m gettin\u0027 better.\u0027\n \u0027You sure are,\u0027 Ray Martin said.\n \u0027I guess I could play another game, you want,\u0027 Ross said.\n Ray Martin shook his head and said, \u0027You don\u0027t get that much better that quick, and seems to me you ain\u0027t talkin\u0027 slow as you were before. You sound a little uptown to me.\u0027\n \u0027Well, a Co-Cola and a good game perks me,\u0027 Ross said. \u0027I guess it\u0027s the sugar.\u0027\n Ray Martin\u0027s eyes narrowed and his forehead wrinkled. \u0027You\u0027re a hustler. You hustled me.\u0027\n Ross looked as if he had just received a blow. \u0027I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re talkin\u0027 like that. You wanted to play. I tried to quit. I tried to pay out on you.\u0027\n \u0027You were playin\u0027 me,\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027You and that car. That ain\u0027t no car like a cracker would have. I should have known. You ain\u0027t from around here. You\u0027re a pool-hall hustler. You\u0027re makin\u0027 the towns, ain\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m just a man likes a good contest now and again,\u0027 Ross said, \u0027and I\u0027ve had a lucky day.\u0027\n \u0027Tell you somethin\u0027,\u0027 Ray Martin said, \u0027your goddamned luck just run out.\u0027 And then Ray Martin\u0027s hand dipped into his pocket. We saw a flash of silver, and Ross made a face, and Ray Martin\u0027s little cheap Saturday-night special coughed, and we all jumped, and then Ross, who was still holding the pool cue, dropped it, fanned his right knee out to the side, then collapsed as if someone had opened a trapdoor beneath him. The way he fell, the way he crumpled, there wasn\u0027t any doubt he was dead. A little hole in his forehead began to ooze blood. The air filled with the stench of what Ross had left in his pants.\n Rugger said, \u0027Oh, hell.\u0027\n The retard said, \u0027You hit him right \u0027tween the eyes, and he done shit on himself.\u0027\n Ray Martin turned and looked at me and my friends. We were as quiet as the walls around us. He pointed the gun in my direction. \u0027You,\u0027 he said, \u0027you look in his pockets, see you can find his keys.\u0027\n I hesitated only a moment, and Rugger said, \u0027I got it.\u0027 Rugger went over and pushed the guy around on the floor so that he could get to his pockets easy, found the keys, held them up, shook them.\n \u0027Now my money, and his too,\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027I\u0027m claimin\u0027 some interest.\u0027\n Rugger got the man\u0027s money and gave it to Ray Martin, who folded it up and shoved it in the front pocket of his jeans. He tossed the keys on the pool table.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Ray Martin said, turning back to me. \u0027I want you, tough guy, you and no one else to take those keys and go outside and unlock the trunk of his car, and then I want you back in here faster than a bunny fucks, you understand? Otherwise, you go in the trunk with him after I shoot your balls off. You got me, dry fuck?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 I said, and when I spoke, my mouth was dust-dry. The word came out more like a cough. This wasn\u0027t some scuffle in the halls at school, some after-school fist-fight at the Dairy Queen. This was the real thing. This was the world where real tough guys lived, and I wasn\u0027t one of them.\n I took the keys and went outside and unlocked the trunk of the Impala and lifted it up and went back inside. \u0027Give me them keys,\u0027 Ray Martin said. I gave them to him. He said, \u0027I don\u0027t like nobody likes to cheat me. I got rules. Don\u0027t cheat me, don\u0027t hang with niggers, and don\u0027t let women tell you what to do. Keep your hands away from my wallet. And don\u0027t never back down. Them\u0027s my rules. He broke one of them.\u0027\n \u0027You didn\u0027t have to shoot him,\u0027 Rugger said. \u0027We could have just beat his ass and got your money back.\u0027\n \u0027You got him right \u0027tween the eyes,\u0027 the retard said, suddenly overcome again with Ray Martin\u0027s marksmanship.\n \u0027Shut up, Retard,\u0027 Rugger said. \u0027Now we got a mess.\u0027\n \u0027Mess can get cleaned up,\u0027 Ray Martin said. He looked at Donny. \u0027You, nickel dick, go over there and lock the door and pull the blind down. Now.\u0027\n Donald pulled the blind down over the glass and locked the door. Ray Martin waved the gun at Donald and said, \u0027When I tell you, you look out there see ain\u0027t no one comin\u0027. Someone\u0027s comin\u0027, you close the door and lock it. Ain\u0027t no one comin\u0027, you say so, and don\u0027t be wrong. Got me?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 Donald said, as if he were speaking to a teacher.\n \u0027You, tough guy,\u0027 he said to me, \u0027you acted like you wanted some of my action. You still wantin\u0027 it?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027No, huh. That the way you talk to me? You heard how your friend spoke to me. Let me hear some of that.\u0027\n \u0027No, sir,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027Now you\u0027re talkin\u0027. Stay sharp, I might need you to wipe my butt with your tongue. But right now, you get hold of this fucker\u0027s legs, and you,\u0027 he said to Lee, \u0027you get his head, and you boys take him out and put him in the trunk of his car and close the lid and come back in, and don\u0027t screw around.\u0027\n We picked up the body, and a hair-covered fragment from the back of his skull fell against the tile with a sound like pottery being dropped. As we lifted him, I found myself drawn to his face. Ross\u0027s eyes were wide open, and I saw then that everything he had been or might have been, all of his plans and memories, dreams and schemes, they had fled out through the hole in the back of his skull, across the floor in a puddle of blood and brain fragments, a piece of his skull. The body was empty. It was in that moment I knew something I had never really known before. Oh, I knew it on an intellectual basis. I knew we all died. But this wasn\u0027t like on TV. This guy didn\u0027t just look like a guy lying down. He was truly dead. Looking at him, in that moment, I knew there was nothing beyond the moment, nothing beyond our time on Earth, that dead was dead, and I had never wanted to live more than I did in that moment with my eyes locked on Ross\u0027s face. Hell, he wasn\u0027t Ross any more. He was just meat. Dead meat.\n I got ahold of Ross\u0027s feet. The mess in his pants smelled strong. Lee got his shoulders, and we lifted him and carried him toward the door. When we were about there, Donald unlocked and opened the door and looked out, then pushed the door wide open. Me and Lee put Ross in the trunk of the Impala, curled him around his spare tyre, and closed the lid. We went back inside. It was all like a dream.\n \u0027All right, now,\u0027 Ray Martin said, \u0027lock the door.\u0027\n \u0027What now?\u0027 Rugger said, lighting a cigar. The smell of it wafted over the stink Ross had left.\n \u0027Get the retard to wipe the floor up . . . but not yet. The backseat of that Impala, it\u0027s still got room.\u0027 Ray Martin looked at us.\n I said, \u0027Wait a minute.\u0027\n \u0027We ain\u0027t gonna tell nobody,\u0027 Donald said.\n \u0027Nobody,\u0027 Lee said, just in case Donald hadn\u0027t stated our case firmly enough.\n \u0027Hell,\u0027 Ray Martin said, \u0027I know that. Dead men, they don\u0027t talk.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t realize it, but I had backed up against the pool table. I remember it crossing my mind to grab a pool cue, a pool ball, anything. But I knew I wouldn\u0027t. I wouldn\u0027t do anything. I couldn\u0027t move. It was like I was glued to the floor. I thought maybe I was about to do in my pants what Ross had done in his.\n \u0027I know these boys,\u0027 Rugger said softly. \u0027They\u0027d be missed. Their folks know they\u0027re here.\u0027\n That was a lie, but it was a beautiful lie, and I clung to it, hoping.\n \u0027You can tell them they was here but they left,\u0027 Ray Martin said. \u0027I don\u0027t want to take chances. And this one,\u0027 he said, pointing the Saturday-night special at me. \u0027I don\u0027t like him. I didn\u0027t like him soon as I saw him.\u0027\n \u0027I know that,\u0027 Rugger said, and I saw that when he pulled his cigar out of his mouth his hand was shaking. Even he, a man who had fought a mess of oil-field guys with my daddy, he knew Ray Martin was beyond just trouble. Guys like him had invented trouble; they had given it its name. \u0027This boy here,\u0027 Rugger said, \u0027his daddy and me once fought a bunch of oil-field workers together.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that mean to me?\u0027 Ray Martin said.\n \u0027It means you and me is kin,\u0027 Rugger said, \u0027and I\u0027m asking a favor. It\u0027s not like you didn\u0027t get your money back.\u0027\n Ray Martin went quiet. You could almost see his brain working behind his skull. \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027I wasn\u0027t gonna do nothin\u0027. Not really. Well, maybe with the tough guy here.\u0027 He waved the gun at me. \u0027But here\u0027s the thing, and you little turds listen tight as a nun\u0027s ass, \u0027cause you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll be seein\u0027 me and this here gun, maybe a knife or a tyre tool . . . : You didn\u0027t see a fuckin\u0027 thing.\u0027\n \u0027No. Nothin\u0027,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027What you gonna do with the hayseed?\u0027 Rugger asked.\n \u0027He wasn\u0027t no hayseed. He was a goddamned pool shark. I\u0027m gonna drive him out to the river bottoms. I know a place you can drive that car off, and it\u0027ll go deep. And you, Rugger, you\u0027re gonna follow me. Maybe we ought to pop the retard too, put him in the backseat.\u0027\n Rugger shook his head. \u0027He\u0027s all right. He won\u0027t remember nothin\u0027 come tomorrow mornin\u0027. Hell, I got to tell him when to shit.\u0027\n \u0027You got him right \u0027tween the eyes,\u0027 the retard said.\n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 Rugger said. \u0027You go on and sit down on that stool and shut up.\u0027\n The retard hung his head and went and sat on the stool.\n \u0027You can get you a Co-Cola,\u0027 Rugger said, and the retard got a soda and popped it and went and sat back on the stool and sipped it.\n Ray Martin said, \u0027I don\u0027t know, man. I\u0027m thinking on it some more, and I don\u0027t know I should let these asswipes go.\u0027\n \u0027They ain\u0027t gonna say nothin\u0027,\u0027 Rugger said. \u0027You boys . . . you ain\u0027t gonna say nothin\u0027, are you?\u0027 \u0027About what?\u0027 Donny said.\n \u0027There you go,\u0027 Rugger said.\n Ray Martin put the gun in his pocket and said, \u0027Maybe.\u0027\n \u0027The retard finishes his Coke,\u0027 Rugger said, \u0027we\u0027ll have him wipe up that blood, spray some air freshener around. You drive the fella\u0027s car to the bottoms, Ray Martin, and I\u0027ll follow. We\u0027ll get rid of him. You boys, you go on out the back way. And don\u0027t you never say nothin\u0027. Nothin\u0027. Not a fuckin\u0027 word.\u0027\n \u0027No, sir,\u0027 I said, \u0027we won\u0027t,\u0027 and then I looked at Ray Martin and said, \u0027We won\u0027t say anything, sir. I promise.\u0027\n Ray Martin grinned at me. His teeth reminded me of an animal trap. \u0027Go on then, punks, before I bend you over this pool table and fuck you in the ass, one at a time.\u0027\n We went quickly out the back door and didn\u0027t say a word, just split and went three different ways.\n Of course, I saw Donny and Lee after that, in school, in the halls. We waved or smiled, but we didn\u0027t hang. I don\u0027t think they thought I was so tough any more. We went our own ways after that. I never went back to the pool hall. I doubt they did. I thought about telling someone about what happened, but didn\u0027t, and to the best of my knowledge, neither did Donny or Lee. I had nightmares. I still have nightmares.\n I saw Rugger around town a few times and nodded at him. He always looked at me like he\u0027d never seen me before, and he never came back to the garage. Ray Martin I never saw again, and I\u0027m not bothered by that. I never even asked anyone about him, and I think I heard he was in prison somewhere for something or another. I think about Ross a lot, that face, that empty face, all the life there was and ever would be gone from it, leaving the rest of us aware and alone, waiting. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology/page-18.html","bookId":2463,"book":{"id":2463,"title":"The New Dead: A Zombie Anthology","description":"Storyline: \n Resurrection! \n The hungry dead have risen.
