{"id":81264,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"BY MIKE CAREY\\n\\n Here\u0027s my problem with dead people: they fall apart.\\n\\n Okay, I grant you, the transition to being a stiff is a shock to the system. You wake up one morning, and you feel like shit - death warmed over, as they say, or rather death cooling rapidly toward background ambient. You feel for a pulse - not verifiably present. But is that because it\u0027s not there, or because you\u0027re a klutz and you can\u0027t take a pulse?\\n\\n Okay, you can\u0027t feel a heartbeat, either. That\u0027s ominous, because you\u0027re so fucking scared by this time that your heart should be racing, not parked at the curb with the hand brake on.\\n\\n You draw a ragged, stressy breath . . . and it just stays there. Nowhere to go. Your body isn\u0027t metabolizing oxygen any more, and your formerly autonomic functions are all unplugged from the board. The pressure doesn\u0027t build. You could keep that breath pent up behind your teeth for a minute, an hour, a day and a half, and you\u0027re never going to feel the slightest need to let it out again.\\n\\n The sign on the door just flipped, from OPEN to CLOSED. This is it. Grammatically, you can never start a sentence with \u0027I am\u0027 again. It\u0027s \u0027was/not-was\u0027, all the way.\\n\\n But that\u0027s no reason to let up, is what I\u0027m saying. Too many people use death as an excuse, and I\u0027m sick of hearing it. The world\u0027s still out there, people. It\u0027s not going away. The rules of the game didn\u0027t change because you croaked and, like they say, if you don\u0027t get back in the saddle, you\u0027re gonna end up trampled and covered in horseshit. Your choice.\\n\\n I used to be a stockbroker, which is probably what killed me. Or rather, being a great broker is what killed me - having the kind of obsessive edge that took me to the top of the NASDAQ while most of my respected peers were still flossing their teeth and picking out a tie that matched their hand-stitched braces.\\n\\n It\u0027s a tough gig, don\u0027t mistake me. When you\u0027re playing a bunch of DAX-listed storm-troopers off against a third-party boiler room, taking a trim on buy and sell at the same time, and cutting your T+3s so tight there\u0027s no skin left on your fingertips, it\u0027s a bit like riding a log flume must be. There are hundreds of millions of euros rolling under you, behind you, and you know damn well if you lose the flow and try to stop it before it\u0027s ready, you\u0027ll go down and never see daylight.\\n\\n So, yeah, there\u0027s a certain level of stress that you live with. I won\u0027t say \u0027thrive on\u0027, because that\u0027s macho bullshit: the adrenaline surge is pleasant for about a half an hour, tops. After that your body starts shaking itself to pieces and you\u0027re swallowing heartburn. A day in the dealing room is a day in the slaughter house: you come out of it with other people\u0027s blood and sweetmeats spattered on your shirt, and that\u0027s if you\u0027ve done okay. If you\u0027ve fucked up, it\u0027s your own.\\n\\n I had my first heart attack when I was twenty-six. I usually tell the story so it happened on my actual birthday, but in fact it was the day after. I\u0027d been out all night, flying high on wings of coke and frozen Stolichnaya, then I showered, popped a few dexies, and went back to work. The two guys I was with, they did the same thing, more or less, but they flaked out in the course of the morning - sneaked off to the room with the folding beds that the management lays on for quitters, to keep the crash at bay with a snatched half hour of sleep. I kept right on going, because I was on one of those flux-market rolls where nobody knows what\u0027s happening and you can squeeze the shit from one exchange to another to ride lag on a price you already know is falling. Too good to miss.\\n\\n But like in a bad movie, I start to get a reverb on my hearing. Well, okay, what the fuck? I don\u0027t need to hear properly to see the numbers scrolling up the screen. I\u0027m low-pointing, I\u0027m settling, I\u0027m re-staking dead buys, I\u0027m making those Tokyo asswipes breathe my farts and think it\u0027s good fresh air.\\n\\n And then I was on the ground with a couple of invisible sumo wrestlers sitting on my chest. Tokyo\u0027s revenge, I thought, as I blacked out.\\n\\n Three days at the Portland Clinic on caviar and tenecteplase. Back in the saddle, clip-clop, clip-clop. Because the guys who stop never start again, and that\u0027s the gospel truth. I\u0027ve seen it enough times to know that it\u0027s a natural law.\\n\\n The second attack caught me by surprise, because this time I wasn\u0027t even working: I was with a woman - using with to denote the act of coitus. Normally I\u0027m pretty good at sex; I can reach a plateau and stay there for as long as I like until my partner of choice is ready to join me for the final pull toward the summit. On this particular occasion, however, the lady had to struggle out from underneath my inert body and call the emergency services. I\u0027d been wearing her panties as a party hat, and I still was when I woke up - not at the Portland but at the Royal Free. Fucking paramedics. They ripped off my diamond cufflinks, too, but how the hell do you prove it? When you\u0027re unconscious, people can take all the liberties they like.\\n\\n So that was two, and the doctors said I should expect strike three to come over the plate pretty damn soon if I didn\u0027t change up and get myself some Zen-like calm. I didn\u0027t waste any time on that prescription: I am what I am, and I play to my strengths.\\n\\n So I looked death square in his poker face, I saw what he was holding, and I implemented plan B.\\n\\n Look, this isn\u0027t just me talking big, okay? I don\u0027t need to impress a Z-list shmuck like you, and in any case, it\u0027s basic. Basic stuff. Anyone with any sense can take the temperature and pack for the weather they know is rolling in.\\n\\n The dead started coming back a few years ago now, around the turn of the new millennium. Actually, it probably started a whole lot earlier than that, but that was when the trickle turned into a flood. Some of them come back in the spirit, some in the body. An acquaintance of mine who makes what he humorously calls a living as an exorcist says it\u0027s all the same thing: zombies are people whose ghosts cling to their own dead flesh out of fear or stubbornness or sheer habit, and they learn by trial and error how to get things moving again. You hear crazier stories, too - human ghosts ram-raiding animal bodies and doing a little forcible redecorating. \u0027Formative causation\u0027, they call it, or some other bullshit periphrasis: You look like what you think you should look like, at least most of the time. But the animal soul is still in there with you, and when you\u0027re at your weakest, it will try and slip out from under. That, the so-called experts tell us, is what werewolves are.\\n\\n Ghost, zombie, or loup-garou - those were the options I was looking at, assuming I didn\u0027t just \u0027go gentle into that good night\u0027 like some passive-aggressive moron. So I planned accordingly, in between strike two and strike three. I had a shed- load of money put by already - salted away against a retirement I clearly wasn\u0027t going to live to enjoy. Now I put some of that cash to work, although first of all I set up a Celtic knot of offshore- registered shelf companies to handle my assets. Dead men can\u0027t legally own jackshit, but corporations are immortal. I bought a lot of real estate, because the property bubble had finally burst around about then, and you could pick up some really sweet deals. Partly I was just diversifying my holdings, but I was also looking for a place where I could set up postmortem. What I needed was a pieda-terre that was both huge and invisible - standing on its own grounds, because nosy neighbors would be the last thing I needed.\\n\\n I settled on a disused cinema in Walthamstow - the Gaumont. It was going for a song, despite having a Cecil Masey facade and most of the interior fixtures and fittings still intact. It was 1930s vintage and had never been either burned out or turned into a bingo hall. It had been a porno theater, briefly, but I wasn\u0027t too worried about sticky carpets. In fact, I wasn\u0027t worried about the auditorium at all. I stripped out the projection booth and fitted it with a bespoke arrangement of air-conditioning and freezer units. Temperature and humidity control were going to be key.\\n\\n Somewhere around then was when my personal extinction event happened. RIP, Nicholas Heath - no flowers or known grasses, by request. But I\u0027d been expecting it. It was, you know, a bump in the road. Nothing more. I\u0027d already decided which kind of dead man I was going to be, and I\u0027d made sure that the funeral parlor would hold off on the burial for at least a week, to give the other shoe a chance to drop.\\n\\n To be honest with you, I don\u0027t like to talk about that part of it. Some people say they see tunnels, blinding white lights, heavenly messengers or moving stairways. I didn\u0027t see anything. But I did have the sense of not being completely in control, and that fucking scared me. I mean, for all I knew, it could be a lottery. Maybe you didn\u0027t get to choose which way the ball would bounce. I might find myself looking like Casper the friendly fuckwit, or Lassie, or in some other stupid, inconsequential, unworkable shape. Or nothing. Nothing at all. Not all the dead come back, even now.\\n\\n But I did, and I came back as me. I sat up on the morgue slab, signed myself out, collected my effects, and hit the road. Forget about statutory notice, or packing up any of the stuff from my apartment. Dead men aren\u0027t covered by contract: my job was gone, my casa was someone else\u0027s casa, and the landlord had probably already changed the locks. I headed straight for the Gaumont, bolted the doors, and got on with the job.\\n\\n It was good timing, in a way: I\u0027d finally gotten the air-conditioning units working properly at two degrees Celsius, and I had the place all set up to move into. Which was just as well, because it was the last moving I did for a while: the fucking rigor mortis hits you soon after you sit up and look around, and for the next twenty- four hours, it\u0027s all you can do to roll your eyes to the heavens.\\n\\n So I\u0027m lying there, in the dark, because I didn\u0027t get a chance to turn the lights on before my muscles seized up, and I\u0027m running through the list in my mind.\\n\\n Rancidification.\\n\\n Black putrefaction.\\n\\n Butyric fermentation.\\n\\n Dry decay.\\n\\n These, collectively, were the joys now in store for me. And every second I wasted meant more hassle later, so as soon as the rigor passed, I spat on my hands - figuratively speaking - and started taking the appropriate measures.\\n\\n Rancidification, the first stage, is far and away the most dangerous. That\u0027s when all the fluids in your body rot and go sour. The smell is fucking indescribable, but that\u0027s not what you\u0027ve got to worry about. The souring releases huge quantities of gas, which builds up in your body cavity wherever there\u0027s a void for it to collect in. If you don\u0027t do something about it, the pressure of the gas can do huge damage to your soft tissues - rip you open from the inside out. But if you make incisions to let out the gas, every hole is a problem that has to be managed at the putrefaction stage.\\n\\n I got a long way with some ordinary plastic tubing, which I shoved into a great many places I\u0027m not keen to talk about. In the end I had to make some actual incisions, but I kept them to a minimum: I was also helped by an amazing substance called Lanobase 18, which is what undertakers use to soak up the fluid leaking from your internal organs and turn it into an inert, almost plasticized slurry.\\n\\n As far as the putrefaction stage went, I was already ahead of the game just by having a cold, controlled space of my own. No insects to lay their eggs in my moldering flesh; no air- or ground-borne contaminants. I used that time to start the embalming process. I needed it because by now my stink had matured into something really scary. I kept having to pour cologne onto my tongue to blitz what was left of my airway and nasal passages, because even though I wasn\u0027t inhaling, the smell was still getting through to me somehow.\\n\\n By the time I hit phase three, I was more than half pickled - and now it started to get easier. What was left of my flesh changed its consistency, over the space of a couple of weeks, into something hard and waxy. Adipocere, they call it. It\u0027s kind of unsettling at first, because it doesn\u0027t feel like anything even slightly organic, but it has the huge upside that it doesn\u0027t smell of anything much. I could live with myself now.\\n\\n Dry decay mainly affects your bones, through a leeching of organic compounds called diagenesis, so I just let it happen and turned my attention to other things.\\n\\n Unfortunately, I\u0027d missed a trick or two while all this was going on. I had the projection booth itself and the adjacent generator room armored up like the fucking Fuhrer-bunker, but I hadn\u0027t bothered with all the ground- floor doors and windows. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d need to: the Gaumont had stood empty and undisturbed for so many years, who was going to pay it any attention now?\\n\\n But the key word there is undisturbed. I\u0027d had a whole lot of kit delivered when I was setting up my freezer and air-conditioning arrays, and I\u0027d had some guys in to reinforce the upstairs walls and doors. I might as well have put out a fucking welcome mat: I was telling all the neighborhood deadbeats that the cinema was now inhabited and that it might contain something worth stealing.\\n\\n In point of fact, it didn\u0027t: everything that was valuable was locked away behind steel bulkhead doors up on the first floor. But that didn\u0027t stop a variegated collection of scumbags from breaking in downstairs, smashing the windows, and ransacking what was left of the old furniture, looking for something they could purloin, pawn, or piss into. Some of them had even moved in and were now squatting in the auditorium or the store-rooms behind it.\\n\\n First things first. I made some calls, using one of the false names and e-mail addresses I\u0027d set up for my offshore holding company, and hired some guys from a private security firm to come in and clear out the squatters\u0027 little rat nest. They threw everything out into the street; then they maintained a presence while I got the builders to come back in and make the place secure.\\n\\n They put steel shutters on the ground- floor windows, and steel bulkhead doors over the old wooden doors, attached to I beams sunk two feet into freeway- mix concrete. I had the work team coat the windowsills and door frames with green antivandal paint, too: the losers could still sleep in the fucking doorway if they wanted to, but I wasn\u0027t going to make it comfortable for them, and that was as far as they were going to get. As a dead man walking, I was too vulnerable: I wanted to have the freedom of the building without worrying about who I might run into. In any case, this was my retirement home now: why the hell should anyone else get the benefit of it? That\u0027s not how life works; take it from a dead man.\\n\\n Relaxing isn\u0027t something I do all that well, but now I felt like I could finally slow down and take stock. I\u0027d ridden out the roller coaster of physical decomposition, at least to the point where I could maintain a steady state. I had my place secured and my lines of communication laid down so that I could get what I needed from the outside world without dealing with it directly.\\n\\n I took a day off. Watched some movies on cable. Opened a bottle of Pauillac and sniffed the wine-breath, since drinking it without any digestive enzymes was an idiot\u0027s game.\\n\\n It was half a day, actually. Half a day off. By the afternoon I was restless, worried about what I might be missing. I fired up the computers - three of them, each registered with a different ISP and apparently logged on in a different time zone - and put some of my money back into play on the New York Exchange.\\n\\n That was a good afternoon and an even better evening. Stress couldn\u0027t touch me now - look, Ma, no glands - I couldn\u0027t get tired, and I didn\u0027t need to take bathroom breaks, so I kept going steadily through a fourteen-hour session, not logging off until the exchange closed.\\n\\n Then I switched to the Nikkei Dow and did the same for another five hours.\\n\\n Man, I thought, this is . . . you know . . . liberating. Death means never having to wipe your ass again, never getting pulled out of the zone by your body\u0027s needs or by someone else blabbing in your ear like they\u0027ve got something to say. It means you can keep going forever, if you want to.\\n\\n Of course, forever is a long time. A long, long, long fucking time.\\n\\n On day three, the deadbeats broke in again. They\u0027d actually sneaked back while the concrete was still setting and pushed one of the steel plates up out of line so they could work it loose later with a crowbar. I could hear them doing the same thing with the door of the projection room - my fucking holy of holies.\\n\\n Yeah, dream on, you verminous little bastards. That door and the wall it was set in were about as porous as a bank vault: Not needing to breathe meant not having to cut corners where personal security was concerned. All the same, I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about what would have happened if the door had been open - if I\u0027d been down on the ground floor picking up my mail or something. I couldn\u0027t take that risk again.\\n\\n This time I thought it through properly: defence in depth was what I needed, not one big-ass door with one big-ass bolt on it. I had the builders - none of whom ever met me in person, of course - completely redesign the ground floor, replacing all the existing walls with steel bulkheads and at the same time putting in a whole lot of new ones. I took my inspiration from the crusader forts of the late Middle Ages, turning the Gaumont into three separate keeps, one inside the other. Only a single vault door connected the outer keep with the middle one, and the middle keep with the inner one. Other doors were devoid of bolts, locks, or handles: they were all independently lockable via a computer-controlled system, and the first thing I did was to slave the whole damn thing to the main server up in the projection booth. I put the closed-circuit (CCTV) cameras in, too - dozens of them, set up so there were no dead angles. I could check out any given stretch of corridor, any given room, and make sure it was clear before I opened the doors and cleared myself a route.\\n\\n What? This sounds like overkill? No, genius, it wasn\u0027t. I was thinking things through, that\u0027s all. Every fortress can turn into a trap, so every fortress needs a back door. And this particular fortress needed a mail slot too, because for some of the things I was doing online I still needed physical documents, physical certification, actual rather than digital signatures. It\u0027s stupid, but it\u0027s true: some parts of the world haven\u0027t started surfing the electron tide yet, and they only believe in what they can hold in their hands. Hah. Maybe not so stupid, when you think about it.\\n\\n So now I could swing back into top gear, stop watching my back. And I did. Believe me, I did.\\n\\n To tell you the truth, I got lost in it. I must have spent a week or more at a time just bouncing from one exchange to another in an endless, breakneck rhythm. You know those velodromes, where the racers ride their bikes almost horizontally on the canted walls? Well, that\u0027s what I was like. The only thing that kept me touching the ground at all was my unthinkable velocity. Which is fine, so long as you never slow down.\\n\\n But I did.\\n\\n It was subtle at first, subtle enough that I didn\u0027t even realize it was happening. I missed a spike here, came in slow on a deal there - not big things and not connected. I was still coming out ahead and still in control. It took me a couple of days to realize that I was too much in control, that I was going through the motions without feeling them and making conscious decisions instead of letting instinct play through me.\\n\\n I tied down, cashed in, and logged off. Sat there in silence for a while, staring at the screens. A wave of grief swept through me, and I don\u0027t care if that sounds stupid - a sense of bereavement. Nicky Heath was dead. I hadn\u0027t really gotten that fact into my head until then.\\n\\n If you stop, you never start again - my own golden rule. But I didn\u0027t feel like I could touch the keyboard right then. I was afraid of screwing up, afraid of hitting some rock I would have seen a mile off back when I had a functioning endocrine system. Look, Ma, no glands.\\n\\n I think I must have been hearing the noises in the walls for a while before that - bangs and scrapes and scuffles, muffled not by distance but by the thickness of the brickwork and the layers of steel plating. But now I let myself listen to them. Jumbled, discontinuous, slightly different each time. It wasn\u0027t the freezer unit or the big electrical generator downstairs. The only things that made noises like that were living things. People. Animals. Members of the big but still exclusive club of entities-with-a-pulse.\\n\\n I turned on the CCTV monitors and did the rounds of the cameras. She wasn\u0027t hard to find, once I started looking: she was in the outer keep, way down on the ground floor, in a blind stretch of corridor between two of my self-locking doors - nowhere near the big steel portal that led through into the middle zone.\\n\\n It was still a nasty shock, though. Sort of like scratching your balls and coming up with a louse.\\n\\n From what I could see, she had to be one of the homeless people - probably in her early twenties but looking a damn sight older, huddled in way too many layers of clothes in a corner made by the angle of wall and door. She had dirty blonde hair and a sullen, hangdog face. Hard to tell anything else, because she was folded down into herself, knees hugged to her chest and head down. It was probably cold down there, in spite of all the layers.\\n\\n Where the hell had she come from? She couldn\u0027t have been in there since the last invasion, because I wouldn\u0027t have missed her, and in any case, she\u0027d be dead by now. There wasn\u0027t anything to eat or drink, and she clearly hadn\u0027t brought anything in with her that she couldn\u0027t carry in her pockets.\\n\\n I backtracked with the cameras until I found the smoking gun - a large vent pipe for one of the freezer units that had been run through the outer wall of the building. She\u0027d just hit it with something - a hammer or a rock - again and again until the flimsy metal bent back on itself far enough for her to squeeze through. That had let her into a part of the building that was on the route I used when I went down to collect the mail. She must have scooted through a door or two that was unlocked when I came through, and then got caught in the dead-end stretch of corridor when I made the return journey and locked up again.\\n\\n She\u0027d tried to get out: those were the sounds I\u0027d heard. She\u0027d hammered and clawed at the door and probably screamed for help, but only faint echoes had come up to the projection room, and I\u0027d been too absorbed in what I was doing to decipher them.\\n\\n Now she looked to be in a bad way. The monitor only resolved in black and white, but there were dark patches on her hands, which I assumed were probably blood - her fingernails damaged from trying to pull on the edge of the doorjamb - and when she briefly came out of her huddle to grab a gulp of air, I saw that her lips were swollen in a way that suggested dehydration.\\n\\n I got up and paced around the room, trying to think it through. I wasn\u0027t capable of panic, but I felt a dull, blunt volume of unhappiness expand inside me, like the intestinal gases back in the first stage of decay.\\n\\n I could just let her die was the first thought that came to mind.\\n\\n I could open up the doors to let her back out the way she\u0027d come, but she might be too weak to move. She might die anyway.\\n\\n If I opened the doors, someone else could get in. Safer just to leave her.\\n\\n But someone could have seen her climbing inside and not come out again. Someone might be looking for her right now or calling the police or crawling through that hole with torches and crowbars and . . .\\n\\n No, nobody else had found the hole. The CCTV cameras didn\u0027t show anyone else, either in the room where the vent let out or anywhere else in the outer keep. I should have put more sophisticated alarms in, I thought irrelevantly - movement sensors, or infrared scanners, or something. I shouldn\u0027t have let this happen. Now here I was, already guilty of false imprisonment or some such bullshit, with the police probably searching the goddamned neighborhood and Christ only knows what kind of trouble to look forward to if she was found here, alive or dead or anywhere in between.\\n\\n I stopped pacing because I\u0027d come up hard against a wall. I wanted to punch it, but that would have been a really stupid thing to do - no blood flow, so no scabbing, no skin repair. Any wound I opened in my own flesh would stay open unless I sewed it shut.\\n\\n I stared at the wall for maybe five minutes, galloping through the same rat-runs inside my head. When I\u0027d done it enough times to be sure they always ended up in the same place, I got moving again.\\n\\n I had no choice. I had to bring the dumb bitch up to good-as-new spec before I cut her loose. I had to make sure there was no harm and no foul, whatever that took.\\n\\n I found a bucket the builders had left behind and a washbasin in what had once been a cleaner\u0027s cupboard behind the projection booth. I cleaned the bucket out as far as I could, then filled it with cold water. I flicked some switches on the main board, releasing the locks on all but one of the doors between me and the woman - leaving just the door that she was leaning against.\\n\\n Then I went down, let myself out through the inner and middle keeps, and made my way around to her stretch of corridor. She must have heard me coming, because when I turned the last bend, I caught the sound of her fists banging on the other side of the door, and her voice, muffled through the thick wood, telling me she was stuck.\\n\\n I left the bucket of water right in front of the door and went back up to the projection booth. I watched the woman on the CCTV hook-up: she was still hammering and shouting, pushing at the door, thinking or at least hoping that someone could hear her.\\n\\n I relocked all the other doors before opening just that one. Since she was leaning her weight against it, she just tumbled through when it opened. She saw the bucket, stared at it with big incredulous eyes, and finally cupped her hands and drank from it. She coughed up a storm and vomited a little, too, but she was alive at least. That was a good start.\\n\\n Food was more of a problem, because unless there were a few hardy rats down in the basement somewhere, there was nothing edible in the entire building. I got around that by going to the Ocado Web site, whose online order form allows you to specify exactly where you want the food to be dropped off. I specified the mailbox, which was actually a double-doored receptacle like the ones post offices use - big enough to take thick bundles of legal papers, and, as it turned out, big enough for a bag of groceries too.\\n\\n I ordered stuff she could eat cold, to keep things simple - turkey breast, bread and rolls, a bag of ready-cut carrot slices, some apples. I added some fun-size cartons of orange juice, and then on an impulse, a bar of Cadbury\u0027s dairy milk.\\n\\n This time I had to approach her from the opposite direction, since she\u0027d gone through the door to get to the water bucket and was now on the other side of the door. It didn\u0027t matter: from the master board up in the projection booth, I could open up any route I liked and make absolutely sure of where she was before I moved in, did the drop-off, and retreated again to the booth and the CCTV monitors.\\n\\n At the sound of the lock clicking, she went scooting back through the door like one of Pavlov\u0027s dogs.\\n\\n She wolfed the food down like she hadn\u0027t seen bread since the Thatcher years. It was a fucking unedifying sight, so I turned off the CCTV and left her to it for a while.\\n\\n The next time I checked, she was done. The floor was strewn with wrappers, apple cores, a crumpled juice carton. The woman had spotted the camera and was staring at it as though she expected it to start talking to her. Actually, it could do that if I wanted it to: the cameras each came with a speaker as standard. But I didn\u0027t have anything I wanted to say to her: I just wanted her to eat, drink, wash, fix herself up, and fuck off out of there.\\n\\n Wash. Okay. I ordered some more groceries and added soap and shampoo to the list, not to mention another bucket. The next time I fed her, I left both drinking water and wash water, but she didn\u0027t take the hint, maybe because the water was cold. Too bad. I didn\u0027t have any way of heating it up, and I wasn\u0027t running a fucking guesthouse.\\n\\n I spent about three days plumping her up. On the second day I left her some bandages and antiseptic for her fingers, which she ignored, just like the wash water. On the third day I made a similarly useless gesture with some clean clothes, ordered online in the same way from the ASDA superstore at Brentwood.\\n\\n Okay, so my reluctant houseguest wasn\u0027t interested in personal hygiene, even on a theoretical level. I don\u0027t know, maybe the dirt acts like insulation out on the street, and maybe after the first month or so your panties get welded to your privates past the point where you can take them off. Maybe not, though, since she had to be managing to piss somehow. Following that thought through, I realized it was probably a good thing that the cameras had such crappy resolution. I could see the corner she was using as a latrine, now that I looked for it, and I sure as hell didn\u0027t want to see it any clearer.\\n\\n Well, the bottom line was that she had to go out looking no worse than when she came in: I wasn\u0027t under any obligation to make her look better.\\n\\n On day four I drew her a map, showing her how to get back to the vent pipe, and left it with the food. Then I threw the lock on the door behind her and all the other locks leading back to the outer wall and her exit point.\\n\\n She examined the map as she ate her breakfast, which was croissant and apricot jam. She\u0027d shown a real taste for pastries by this time and none at all for fresh fruit or cereal.\\n\\n But after she\u0027d finished, she didn\u0027t make a move to step over the threshold. She just wiped her mouth on the napkin provided, dropped it into the water bucket - which always drove me crazy because I had to fish the fucking thing out again - and settled back down against the wall.\\n\\n What was she playing at? She had to realize I was allowing her to leave.\\n\\n \u0027Come on!\u0027 I shouted at the monitor. \u0027Get out of there. You\u0027re free as a bird. Go!\u0027\\n\\n She settled into her characteristic, head-bowed huddle.\\n\\n Impulsively, I flicked the microphone switch on the CCTV board. I\u0027d never used it before, so I had no idea if it even worked, but a light flashed on the board and the woman jerked her head up as though she\u0027d just heard something - a click, maybe, or else a little feedback flutter from the speaker.\\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 I said. \u0027What do you think you\u0027re doing? Time to go, lady.\u0027\\n\\n She blinked twice, her face full of comical wonder. She took her time about answering, though, and when she did it was kind of a non sequitur.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 she demanded.\\n\\n \u0027The owner,\u0027 I said, and then, not to be put off, I repeated, \u0027Time for you to get out of here.\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head.\\n\\n I blinked. \u0027What do you mean, no?\u0027 I asked, too incredulous even to be pissed off. \u0027This is my place, sweetheart. Not yours. You\u0027re not wanted here.\u0027\\n\\n The woman just shrugged. \u0027But I like it here.\u0027\\n\\n The way she said it made me want to go down there and up-end the water bucket on her head. She sounded like a little kid asking if she could stay a bit longer at the beach.\\n\\n \u0027How can you like it?\u0027 I demanded, really annoyed now. \u0027It\u0027s a fucking corridor. You like sleeping on concrete?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I was doing outside,\u0027 she said, calmly enough. \u0027And at least here I don\u0027t have homeless guys wanting to charge me a blow job for a place by the fire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because there is no fire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there is food.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Food\u0027s off,\u0027 I said bluntly. \u0027That was the last of it.\u0027\\n\\n She put her head between her folded arms again, as a way of telling me the conversation was over.\\n\\n \u0027I mean it,\u0027 I said. \u0027Food\u0027s off. You stay here, you starve to death.\u0027\\n\\n She didn\u0027t answer. Fine, so she wanted to be alone. I turned off the sound and left her to it.\\n\\n \u0027Dumb bitch,\u0027 I said to the monitor, even though she couldn\u0027t hear me now.\\n\\n That was going to be the first item in a varied agenda of invectives, but I realized suddenly what had just happened, what was still happening. I was angry. I\u0027d managed to get angry, somehow, even though on the face of it I didn\u0027t have the necessary equipment any more.\\n\\n If I could do anger, then presumably I could do other flashy emotional maneuvers too. Quickly I fired up my computers and logged on to my U.S. trading board. I didn\u0027t surface for five hours, and by that time I was three hundred thousand up on the day.\\n\\n Saint Nicholas was back, with gifts of ass-kickings for all.\\n\\n After I closed out on the day, I checked in with the woman. She seemed to be asleep, but she stirred when I clicked the mike back on.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s your name, darling?\u0027 I asked her.\\n\\n \u0027Janine,\u0027 she muttered, looking muzzily to camera.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Nick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Nick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can stay here to night,\u0027 I said. \u0027Tomorrow we\u0027ll talk.\u0027\\n\\n But we didn\u0027t. Not much, anyway. I made a food drop at 6:00 A.M., before she was even awake, then came back upstairs and logged on. I had another good day on the markets, and the day went by in a blur. I did order a folding bed, though, and some blankets and pillows to go on it. I picked a local store that could deliver immediately, had them leave it round by the back door, and lugged it in myself after they\u0027d gone. It made my skin prickle just a little to be in the outside air again, even though it wasn\u0027t a warm day or anything. Just psychosomatic, I guess.\\n\\n Over the next few days, I furnished Janine\u0027s corridor pretty lavishly. She arranged it: all I did was buy the stuff and bring it to the door then let her choose for herself where to put it. I\u0027d started to leave the mike on by this time so she could tell me what she wanted - a chair and a table, a kettle for making tea, a chemical toilet, even a little portable DVD player and a few movies for her to watch while I was busy on the trading boards.\\n\\n The weirdest thing of all, though, was that I actually started talking to her while I was dealing. It seemed to help me concentrate, in some way I couldn\u0027t quite define. Most of the things she liked to talk about were stupid and irritating - her favorite celebrities, previous seasons of Big Brother, her hatred for supermodels. I just made \u0027I\u0027m still listening\u0027 noises whenever they seemed to be called for and channeled the aggravation into some world-class short-selling.\\n\\n It got so that if she actually shut up for a while, I\u0027d throw in a question or two to get her talking again. Questions about herself she didn\u0027t like to answer, except to say that she was living on the street because of something that had happened between her and her stepfather back when she turned eighteen. I got the impression that it had been a violent and dramatic kind of something, and that the stepfather had gotten the worst of the deal.\\n\\n \u0027He came on to you?\u0027 I asked, genuinely, if slightly, curious.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose. He came into the bathroom when I was showering one morning and tried to get in with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s pretty unequivocal,\u0027 I allowed.\\n\\n \u0027Pretty what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Clear-cut. Hard to misinterpret.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, right. So I smacked him in the mouth with the showerhead really hard, and then I ran out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Naked?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Nick. Not naked.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then you were showering in your street clothes?\u0027\\n\\n A pause. \u0027I didn\u0027t run out straightaway. He fell down and hit his head. I had time to grab some stuff.\u0027\\n\\n This was in Birmingham, Janine told me, as if I could possibly have mistaken her accent. She\u0027d taken a bus down to London the same day, hoping to stay with a friend who was studying hairdressing and beauty at Barnet College. But the friend had acquired a boyfriend and wasn\u0027t keen on that arrangement. She passed Janine off to another girl, whose floor she occupied for a while. Not a very long while, though: there was an argument about the rules for the use of the bathroom, and she was out on her ear again before the end of the week.\\n\\n I was starting to see why Janine wasn\u0027t big on washing.\\n\\n \u0027So what about you, Nick?\u0027 she asked me, when we\u0027d been doing this for maybe a week or so. \u0027What do you do for a living?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 I said, \u0027when you put it like that, Janine, the answer has to be nothing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can hear you typing away up there,\u0027 she said. \u0027Are you writing a book?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 I lied. \u0027I\u0027m writing a book. But it\u0027s not to earn a living.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How come? You\u0027re already rich?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m already dead,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n That remark led to a very long silence. The next time I checked on her, she was asleep.\\n\\n In the morning, she asked me if she could see me.\\n\\n \u0027The cameras only work one-way,\u0027 I pointed out.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean on the cameras. I mean, you know, face-to-face. \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll think about it,\u0027 I lied.\\n\\n But she wouldn\u0027t leave the idea alone: she kept bringing it up last thing at night, when I was logging off and cashing in. I kept being evasive, and she kept going quiet on me, which was fucking annoying. I\u0027d say good night, get nothing back: she went to sleep each night surrounded by a miasma of hurt silence.\\n\\n In the end, I did it by accident - almost by accident, I should say. When I unlocked the doors one morning so I could drop off a food delivery, I flicked one switch too many. She was waiting for me as I turned the corner, leaning against the open door with her arms folded in a stubborn, take- no-prisoners kind of pose. The crazy thing is, I sort of knew on some level that I\u0027d done it, that I\u0027d opened the final door and removed that last degree of prophylaxis between us. I just didn\u0027t let myself think about it until we were face-to-face and it was too late to back out.\\n\\n She stared at me for a long time in silence. Then her face wrinkled up in a sort of slo-mo wince. \u0027You look horrible,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 I answered inadequately. \u0027You say the sweetest fucking things.\u0027\\n\\n That made her laugh just a little, the sound pulled out of her almost against her will. She took a few steps toward me, then stopped again and sniffed the air cautiously.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that smell?\u0027 she wanted to know.\\n\\n \u0027Which one? I have a complex bouquet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s like . . . antiseptic or something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Formaldehyde, probably. I\u0027m pickled inside and out, Janine. It\u0027s why I don\u0027t smell of rotten meat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You smell of that too.\u0027\\n\\n I bridled at that, like some living guy accused of having bad body odor. \u0027I don\u0027t,\u0027 I said. \u0027I went to a lot of fucking effort to-\u0027\\n\\n She made a gesture that shut me up, kind of a pantomime of throwing up her hands in surrender, except that she only threw them up about an inch or so. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re right. You don\u0027t smell rotten. You just look like you should smell rotten. Your skin is all waxy and sweaty, and I can see stitches in your neck.\u0027\\n\\n My carotid was one of the places where I\u0027d inserted a trocar to draw off some of my bodily fluids way back when I was fighting the war on rot. \u0027Don\u0027t get me started,\u0027 I advised her.\\n\\n So she didn\u0027t.\\n\\n \u0027Show me where you live,\u0027 she suggested instead.\\n\\n She stayed upstairs with me for an hour or so, wrapped in three coats against the cold. Then she retired back to her little dead-end corridor, home sweet home, and spent the rest of the day watching movies. Musicals, mostly: I think she was plugging herself back into the world of the living to make sure it was still there.\\n\\n The next day I bought her a couple of hot-water bottles, and she was able to stay longer. I didn\u0027t mind the bottles, so long as she kept them under the coats so the heat stayed right against her skin. The thermostats were still set at the same level, so the room didn\u0027t warm up at all, and she didn\u0027t come close enough to me for the heat to be a problem.\\n\\n I think that was the first day I forgot to lock her in, and after I\u0027d forgotten once, it kind of felt like going back to that state of affairs would be a slap in the face to her - a way of saying that I thought I could trust her; but then decided I didn\u0027t, after all.\\n\\n That thought raised all kinds of other thoughts, because it suggested that I did trust her. There was no reason why I should. Back when I was alive, I\u0027d never felt more for people like her than a kind of queasy contempt, mixed with the unpleasant sensation that usually translates - by some spectacular whitewashing process - as \u0027There but for the grace of God . . .\u0027\\n\\n But God doesn\u0027t have any grace, and I don\u0027t have the time or the temperament for helping lame ducks over stiles. If I meet a lame duck, generally speaking, I make duck a l\u0027orange.\\n\\n So what the fuck was going on here, anyway?\\n\\n At first, I justified it to myself by counting up my market winnings. Janine could make me feel things again, as though my endocrine system was pumping away like it did in the old days - and that gave me a lot of my wonted edge back. But plausible as that explanation was, it was ultimately bullshit. After a week or so, I was spending more time talking to her than I was in managing my portfolios. A week after that, I wasn\u0027t even bothering to log on.\\n\\n At this point I was even making a loss on the deal, because I kept buying her stuff. It wasn\u0027t even stuff she needed to live any more: it was chocolates and beer and doughnuts and even - I swear to God - a fucking hat.\\n\\n You\u0027re probably thinking that there was some kind of a sexual dynamic going on. Janine certainly thought so. When I presented her with the final little chachka - the straw that broke the camel\u0027s neck, so to speak - she stared at it for a long time without reaching out to take it. She looked unhappy.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 I demanded. \u0027What\u0027s the matter? It\u0027s just a necklace. See, it\u0027s got a J on it, for Janine. Those are diamonds, you realize. Little ones, but still . . .\u0027\\n\\n She looked me squarely in the eye - no coyness, no pissing around. \u0027Do I have to blow you to sit at the fire?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n I thought about that. I wasn\u0027t insulted: it was a fair question, I assumed, given the way she lived outside on the streets. I also wondered for a split second if she might be offended if she realized how far I was from being attracted to her. She was dirty, she was as skinny as a stick, and she had bad skin. Back when I had a pulse, I would have sooner fucked a greased oven glove.\\n\\n \u0027There is no fire,\u0027 I reminded her.\\n\\n She nodded slowly. \u0027Okay, then,\u0027 she said, and took the necklace.\\n\\n But the writing was on the wall, because once I figured out what it wasn\u0027t, I couldn\u0027t hide any more from what it was.\\n\\n That shitty old poem: it\u0027s not \u0027lame ducks over stiles.\u0027 It\u0027s \u0027lame dogs\u0027.\\n\\n I watched her sleep that night, and I knew. I let myself see it instead of hiding from it. Fuck, it was nice, you know - watching ghost expressions chase themselves across her face. Hearing her breathe.\\n\\n The next morning I gave her a roll of notes - maybe twenty grand, maybe a little more - and told her to get lost.\\n\\n She cried and she asked me what she\u0027d done to hurt me. I told her she\u0027d figure it out if she thought about it long enough. When she asked about the money, I said it was a one-time payment: she should use it to get the hell away from here, and not talk about me to anyone she knew on the street, or else I\u0027d have all the homeless schmucks in Walthamstow climbing up my drainpipes.\\n\\n She cried some more, and I knew she didn\u0027t buy it. It didn\u0027t matter, though: that was all the explanation I was prepared to give her. I walked her down the stairs, through the maze, all the way to the door. I unlocked it for her. She stepped across the threshold then turned to stare at me.\\n\\n Neither of us said anything for the space of three heartbeats. Maybe four: my memory isn\u0027t reliable in that respect.\\n\\n \u0027Imagine if the necklace had been a collar,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n She nodded. \u0027I get it,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027And if I fitted a little leash to it. Took you out for walkies.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said I get it, Nicky. I don\u0027t think it was like that.\u0027\\n\\n But I knew she was wrong. Old ladies have their cushion dogs, their ugly little pugs and Pekes and Chihuahuas. Dead guys have homeless women.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 Janine said, \u0027for the money. It\u0027s more than I ever had in my life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re welcome,\u0027 I said. \u0027Rent a flat. With a bath or a shower or something.\u0027\\n\\n She refused to be insulted: she just gave me a slow, sad smile.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not good for you here,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s great for me here. Two above freezing. Low humidity. A perfectly controlled environment.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stay in the world, Nicky,\u0027 she murmured, her eyes still brimming in a really unsettling, organic way.\\n\\n \u0027Is that the same as the street?\u0027 I countered. \u0027I\u0027ll pass, thanks.\u0027\\n\\n She made like she was going to hug me, but I raised a hand to ward her off, and she got the point: no body heat or radiated thermic energy, by request.\\n\\n \u0027Bye, then,\u0027 she said, with a slight tremor in her voice.\\n\\n \u0027Bye, Janine,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Is it okay if I write to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not? So long as you make sure there\u0027s adequate postage.\u0027\\n\\n She turned and ran, pretty much, across the parking lot and out of sight around the corner of the building. That was the last I saw of her.\\n\\n I waited to see if she\u0027d come back: it seemed quite likely that she might do that, think of one last thing to say or ask if she could stay one more night or something. I gave her ten minutes, in the end, despite getting that prickly feeling again from having real, unfiltered air flow across my flesh. Finally I shut the front door, did a quick round of the outer circle to make sure I hadn\u0027t taken on any more unwanted passengers, then went back upstairs and locked myself in again.\\n\\n It was really quiet. Quiet as the tomb, like they say, except for the freezer units humming away behind the far wall. I thought about going down and grabbing one of her DVDs, but they were all feel-good shit that would make me want to hawk.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t really feel like going online: the vibe was wrong, which meant the best I could hope for was adequate. But finally, around about midnight, I fired up my digital engines of destruction and got back in the hot seat for a few hours of Far-Eastern mayhem. Because, it\u0027s still true, you know? Still gospel, in my book:\\n\\n The guys who stop never start again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology/page-12.html","bookId":2463,"book":{"id":2463,"title":"The New Dead: A Zombie Anthology","description":"Storyline: Resurrection! \\n The hungry dead have risen.
