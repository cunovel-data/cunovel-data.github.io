With stories from Joe Hill, John Connolly, Max Brooks, Kelley Armstrong, Tad Williams, David Wellington, David Liss, Aimee Bender, Jonathan Maberry, and many others, this is a wildly diverse and entertaining collection... the last word on The New Dead.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology.jpg","author":"Christopher Golden","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:34:57 PM"}}]
