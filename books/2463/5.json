{"id":81258,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"BY TIM LEBBON We should have known that one day they\u0027d refuse to let us leave. I\u0027d already seen the fresh smoke rising from the cremation pits, and a sensation of cold dread had settled in my stomach. But I chose not to mention it to the others. Jamie\u0027s bluff and bluster would only piss me off, and I feared it would send Bindy over the edge. If in the end events drove her to madness or suicide, I didn\u0027t want to be the catalyst. So it wasn\u0027t until we reached the old stone river bridge that the truth began to dawn. \u0027What the fuck?\u0027 Jamie said. \u0027Toby . . .\u0027 Bindy let go of the cart and grabbed my hand. Before the plague, we\u0027d only known each other in passing, and there was nothing sexual here, but contact helped her cope. As for me . . . it only made me think of the past. \u0027They\u0027ve blocked the bridge,\u0027 I said. \u0027And they\u0027re burning something in the pits.\u0027 Jamie jogged off ahead of us, approaching the barrier of roughly laid concrete block and barbed wire they\u0027d built while we\u0027d been searching. \u0027Toby . . .?\u0027 Bindy said again, her hand squeezing hard. \u0027It\u0027s okay,\u0027 I said, squeezing back. Though I knew it was not. I looked down at the cart we\u0027d been pushing. The body of a small child stared back at me. She had died during the initial outbreak and had been motionless since the Purge three weeks earlier, but her eyes still held a glimmer of something resembling life. That was always the worst thing for me - not that they\u0027d moved when they were dead or were mindless or craved the gristly hearts of the living, but that in their eyes they looked so alive. The girl stared back at me, unseeing. I looked away. \u0027Hey!\u0027 Jamie shouted. \u0027Come and see!\u0027 \u0027Toby, I don\u0027t want to go up there,\u0027 Bindy said. \u0027Then stay with her,\u0027 I said, letting go and walking after Jamie. I heard Bindy\u0027s sharp intake of breath and knew that I could be cruel. But she was weak, and sometimes I lost patience with her. I reached the block wall and climbed, joining Jamie where he looked through the swirls of razor wire topping it. I could still smell the rich, warm odor of wet cement. \u0027Something\u0027s happened,\u0027 he said. For once, his understatement was surprising. There had been an army camp on the other side of the bridge. For three weeks, the three of us had been bringing bodies out of Usk, back over the bridge and delivering them into the hands of the scientists. We each had different reasons for doing so, and all of them involved dead people. We had found Jamie\u0027s sister on day one, torn apart in a pond in their garden, her chest opened and heart ripped out. There had been a squirrel feeding on her eyes, and I\u0027d been shocked, because I never knew a squirrel would eat meat. Bindy\u0027s parents were two of the infected killed during the Purge, and we\u0027d brought them both out during the second week. Her mother had been covered with dried blood, and in her father\u0027s hand was the remains of something meaty. They\u0027d had those same staring, glittering eyes, wet and knowing, even in true death. My own dear Fiona eluded me still. Now the camp was abandoned. There were still a few of the prefab huts they\u0027d used, and a tent flapped in the lonely breeze. The field was churned up, and the old cottage they\u0027d requisitioned as a command post was empty. Its windows and door had been left open, and that just seemed so careless. The rain will get in, I thought. I laughed softly. \u0027What is it?\u0027 Jamie asked. \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \u0027So where the fuck have they gone?\u0027 I shrugged, but my eyes were drawn to the smoke still rising from the pyres, the fires and pits hidden beyond a thick copse of trees. After we brought the bodies out and they\u0027d done their tests, that was where they disposed of them. Someone was burning now. The smoke was black and greasy, the smell sickly and mouthwatering. \u0027Moved back,\u0027 I said. \u0027Pulled the perimeter out away from the village.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 he asked, but I could see him looking at the smoke as well. \u0027Fuckers,\u0027 he said softly. I turned and looked back down the curve of the bridge at Bindy. She\u0027d stepped in front of the trailer so she did not have to look at the little dead girl, and she was staring up at us, eyes wide and hands clasped between her breasts. When she saw my expression, she looked at the road surface. \u0027They should tell us what they found, shouldn\u0027t they?\u0027 Jamie asked. \u0027So ask them.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 I nodded across at the torn-up field. Birds were flocking across it, exploring for worms where the soil had been recently turned. \u0027You don\u0027t think they\u0027d leave us alone, do you? We could climb the wall, swim the river. Walk out of Usk.\u0027 I was scanning the landscape as I spoke, searching for movement, or the telltale glint of sunlight on binoculars or rifle scopes. I could see nothing, but that didn\u0027t mean they were not there. \u0027They\u0027ll be there to make sure we don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027m going to try,\u0027 Jamie said. \u0027Don\u0027t be a fool.\u0027 \u0027Fool?\u0027 He turned to me, eyes wide and glaring, and the fear beneath his constant outrage was patent. \u0027You\u0027ve been treating me like a kid ever since we started this, and I\u0027m a lot younger than you, so I can take that. But I\u0027m not a fucking fool.\u0027 \u0027Fair enough.\u0027 He turned back to the view, scanning the hedgerows and hillside beyond, as I had. \u0027They\u0027ll let us out, Toby, won\u0027t they?\u0027 Bindy said behind us. \u0027No,\u0027 I said. It was so quiet that she didn\u0027t hear, but Jamie did. He glanced at me again as he jumped down from the wall. \u0027Later,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m going to swim the river and get out of this shit- hole later.\u0027 I followed him back down to the street. \u0027What do we do with that?\u0027 he said, pointing at the girl\u0027s body. For a second, I was at a loss. By discovering the corpse splayed on a tomb slab in the churchyard, we had effectively taken ownership of it, and the thought of simply dumping her somewhere felt terrible. She was somebody\u0027s daughter, someone\u0027s little girl, and she deserved more than that. \u0027Well, chuck her down a drain somewhere for all I care,\u0027 Jamie said, when neither of us answered. He walked off along the street. \u0027I\u0027m going to the Queen\u0027s. I\u0027ll be in the bar.\u0027 Bindy turned to me. \u0027Let\u0027s put her back where we found her,\u0027 I said, and she seemed to find that acceptable. She almost smiled. Jamie was on the way to drunk by the time Bindy and I arrived at the Queen\u0027s Hotel. He was sitting at a table in the bar, and we arrived in time to see him stagger across, lift the bar flap, pour himself a single whiskey, and then sway back to his seat. By the time he sat down again, he\u0027d almost finished his drink, but perhaps there was something comforting in the process. \u0027Whadidya do with her?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Back in the churchyard,\u0027 Bindy said. Jamie snorted, but I wasn\u0027t sure what that meant. \u0027I\u0027ll get food,\u0027 I said. \u0027Then we should talk about what to do.\u0027 \u0027Talk?\u0027 Jamie shouted. He looked ready to rage, and I tensed. Then the glass slipped from his hand and dropped to the table, landing upright without spilling a drop, and he put one hand to his forehead. He sobbed, once, then looked up at us again, putting on his hard face again. \u0027Jamie-\u0027 Bindy began. \u0027Fuck it!\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s nothing to do but get out. I\u0027ve done nothing . . . nothing wrong. Nor you.\u0027 He pointed at us, and I wondered how many people he saw. \u0027It\u0027s wrong, them keepin\u0027 us in, and . . . I\u0027ll get out.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m getting food,\u0027 I said. I sensed Jamie about to break - it had been coming for days - and I had no wish to see that. I went through behind the bar and into the big kitchen, glancing at the huge walk-in freezer door we hadn\u0027t dared open since the power had gone off. There was still enough food in the larder - tinned stuff, packets, dehydrated fruit and vegetables. At lunchtimes over the past few days, we\u0027d almost laughed about how disgusting it was, but knowing we were now trapped here with no chance of escape, laughter was distant. I knocked together something quick to eat, because there were more important things to do. I carried it back through to the bar and was amazed to see that Jamie had calmed down. He was still drinking steadily, and Bindy sat at the table opposite him with an open bottle of wine and two glasses in front of her. As I sat down she poured me a glass. Jamie stayed on the whiskey. \u0027That fire,\u0027 she said. \u0027We haven\u0027t taken a body out for two days. Could it be that one?\u0027 I remembered the body she meant - a huge, fat woman, naked, her breasts pawed and scratched and teeth clotted with rotting meat. And those eyes, so falsely alive. \u0027They burnt that one the day we took her out,\u0027 I said. \u0027Right,\u0027 Jamie agreed. \u0027So there\u0027s been another outbreak,\u0027 Bindy said. She was staring into the deep violet depths of her glass. The drink had already stained her lips, an effect that I had always found unbearably sexy in women drinking red wine. Not in Bindy, though. \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 I said. \u0027If there had been, why trap us in here?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s in the dust,\u0027 Jamie said. \u0027I\u0027ve told you, haven\u0027t I? I\u0027ve been saying it all along.\u0027 He ran one finger around the inside of his glass, smearing whiskey and touching his finger to his tongue. From day one, Jamie had been suggesting that the plague - virus, bacteria, nobody yet seemed to know exactly what caused it - could be alive in the dust of the deserted town. He\u0027d seen dust settled on the eyes of the bodies we\u0027d found, filtering the light that entered their dead eyes, and I think perhaps it had driven him slightly mad. We were all allowed our own madness. We drank some more but didn\u0027t really come up with anything like a plan. Jamie was drunk and bitter and scared; Bindy was too distant; and I really had no need of a plan at all. My aim had always been to find Fiona\u0027s corpse, wherever it might be, and only one thing really kept me going - the hope that she had been killed and eaten by what people had started to call zombies. The alternative was that she had become one herself, and the thought of looking into her dead eyes knowing that was just too terrible to bear. We took three en-suite rooms next to each other. Bindy and I carried Jamie to bed, trying to ignore his rantings and tears, and then back in the corridor I bid her good-night. \u0027Toby,\u0027 she said, and her voice sounded different. \u0027I know what you think of me, but I\u0027m trying. I\u0027m really trying.\u0027 She slurred slightly, but she was more in control than I had ever seen her. She\u0027d once served me breakfast at a cafe in town - maybe four years ago - and I\u0027d flirted with her. \u0027I keep thinking tomorrow will be another day, but it won\u0027t. It\u0027ll always be today.\u0027 She turned to go to bed, and I reached out and held her arm. She touched my hand and smiled sadly. \u0027Maybe they\u0027ve just upped and left.\u0027 It was fucking stupid, and I knew that, but I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. \u0027They built a wall,\u0027 she said. \u0027And Jamie\u0027s right: none of us has done anything wrong.\u0027 She went to bed then, and so did I. I lay there for some time trying to sleep. The town lay around me, its geography altered completely by what had happened. The town square, its attractive clock tower bedecked with flower troughs, its cobble paving slippery in light summer rain, was now the place where I had found six dead zombies with the remains of several small children they had been fighting over when the Purge came. Where the old castle once stood, I could now only recall seeing the family that had fled there to die - father, mother, and two children, surrounded by their mingled blood vented by the knife in the man\u0027s hand. Streets where I had walked with Fiona, pubs we had drunk in, restaurants where we had eaten and laughed and talked quietly of the possibility of children, all now tainted in some way by what had happened. Some taints were simply the silence; others, blood and rot and death. I was trapped in my hometown, but I had never been in a place so strange. As I drifted to sleep I wondered yet again what had happened to the rest of Usk\u0027s residents. Most of them had fled after the first few attacks, but they were soon rounded up and kept in confinement in the old military base in Glascoed. The majority of those who stayed behind were killed or infected, and then came the Purge, where the whole town was sprayed hourly for three days with what the military had called an \u0027antidote\u0027 when Bindy, Jamie, and I walked out of town across the stone river bridge; the only reason we weren\u0027t shot is that their solution hadn\u0027t killed us. They\u0027d let us stay, suggesting that we help appropriate zombie corpses for the scientists to study. Every day they let us out to sleep in comfortable quarantine, and each morning, I expected it to be the day they no longer let us out. I didn\u0027t care, because Fiona had remained behind and had not yet been found. Faces of old friends and people I knew from the town appeared to me as I dropped into an uneasy slumber. Some of them smiled, some were slack in death. Some of them raged. The sound of helicopters woke me up. I went to the window and saw a military chopper buzzing the town. At first I thought they were spraying again, but then I noticed the cameras mounted under its nose. \u0027Please come out into the street where we can see you,\u0027 an electronic voice said. \u0027Stand at the road junction, and make yourselves known.\u0027 Make yourselves known! I thought. We\u0027d been dragging corpses from the dead town for three weeks for these bastards, and they couldn\u0027t even use our names. I met Bindy out in the corridor, and we knocked on Jamie\u0027s door. He\u0027s dead, I thought, veins slashed, heart given up, brain popped with the pressure. But then he opened the door, squinting in the dawn light. He had a hangover. I chuckled. \u0027Fuck\u0027s wrong with you?\u0027 he growled. \u0027Nothing. Come on, let\u0027s find out what\u0027s going on.\u0027 Bindy and I waited at the road junction outside the hotel for several minutes before Jamie joined us. In that time the chopper swept past three times, the cameras seeming to turn slightly as it went. It was warm already this morning, but the rotors caused a storm in the street that blew waves of dust against smashed shop windows. Jamie coughed and spluttered, washing dust from his mouth with a swig from the whiskey bottle he carried. \u0027You\u0027re kidding me,\u0027 I said. \u0027Hey, it\u0027s a free country!\u0027 He giggled maniacally and took another drink. The chopper came in again and hovered a hundred feet along the street. We could barely see against the dust and grit, and the sound was tremendous. The speakers were even louder. \u0027For your own safety, you will remain in quarantine within the town limits for the next forty-eight hours.\u0027 This is unfair, I thought. We can\u0027t ask them anything. \u0027During that time, certain work will be undertaken. You must not attempt to impede or interfere in any way. You must not attempt to escape.\u0027 \u0027Try and fuckin\u0027 stop me, you bastards!\u0027 Jamie shouted. I realized that he was still drunk. \u0027Any escape attempt will result in the use of deadly force.\u0027 The sound seemed to decrease, and the three of us were trapped in a surreal bubble of shock. They\u0027ll shoot us, I thought, and their military-speak suddenly annoyed the hell out of me. Why couldn\u0027t they just say what they meant? I glanced past Bindy at Jamie. He caught my eye, smiled, and shrugged. Bravado. \u0027Toby Parsons, please proceed alone to the road crossing outside the primary school. There you\u0027ll be given more instructions, and any questions will be answered.\u0027 I hated the sound of that voice, distorted by technology. The speaker could have been laughing or crying, and we\u0027d never know. The chopper lifted away quickly and disappeared over the rooftops, and Jamie gave it the finger. \u0027What does all that mean?\u0027 Bindy said. \u0027What work are they going to do?\u0027 \u0027Hopefully I\u0027ll find out,\u0027 I said. \u0027Why just you?\u0027 Jamie said. \u0027Why the hell is it you who-\u0027 \u0027Jamie,\u0027 I said softly, quietly, and he listened. Maybe I\u0027d never spoken to him in this tone of voice before, but it was about fucking time. \u0027Stay here. Drink coffee. Have a wash. I\u0027ll go and find out what\u0027s happening.\u0027 I glanced at Bindy, and though she was frowning, I could see that she seemed comforted somehow with me taking charge. Not that I wanted to. Last thing I wanted was these two hanging on my back. The only thing I wanted . . . But we\u0027d been looking for three weeks, and if Fiona had been a victim rather than a zombie, I was sure I\u0027d have found her by then. I knew all the places she knew. I\u0027d checked all the places we\u0027d been together. And if I really thought about it, I didn\u0027t really want to keep looking at all. I started along the street. It took me five minutes to reach the school, and all the while I could hear that chopper somewhere in the distance. It was the first time I\u0027d been alone out on the streets since the Purge: every other time, one or both of the others had been with me. I thought I\u0027d be scared, or at least nervous, but I found it quite settling. Most things had changed, but liking my own company was not one of them. As I reached the zebra crossing by the school, I looked along the curving road at the roadblock. It had been there since the first plague outbreak in the town, and I\u0027d seen it a couple of times in the past few days when we went looking for bodies in the school. But now it looked different - larger, for a start, and it had also been added to. Whereas before it had been constructed of a couple of cars turned on their sides and piles of sandbags, now there were several heavy, dark metallic structures behind that. Tall fences stretched away on either side, the one on the left disappearing behind a house and heading uphill, the one leading right forming a straight line across the school\u0027s playing field, merging with the woodland beyond. On either side of the road stood tall posts topped with cameras. They both turned slightly, and I imagined them as eyes observing my approach. Fifty feet away, an amplified voice said, \u0027Remain where you are.\u0027 I stopped, sighed. Everyone was shouting at me today. A man appeared atop the roadblock, obviously standing on a raised section on the other side. He looked across the town behind me before focusing on my face. He appeared nervous. \u0027Toby Parsons?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s me.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m Peter O\u0027Driscoll. I\u0027m a doctor assigned to the research team looking into-\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re one of the scientists that have been cutting up the bodies I\u0027ve been hauling out of here.\u0027 \u0027Yes, if you like.\u0027 He did not seem at all perturbed by my comment. \u0027So what have you found out?\u0027 He paused, but only for a second. \u0027I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s classified.\u0027 I laughed. It was the first real laughter I\u0027d uttered since the plague and since losing touch with Fiona. We\u0027d been half a mile apart when the first attacks came, by my reckoning. Close enough to hear each other screaming. \u0027You\u0027re joking!\u0027 I said. \u0027What movie do you think you\u0027re in?\u0027 I laughed some more. \u0027Your help has been appreciated,\u0027 O\u0027Driscoll said. \u0027Got a medal for me?\u0027 \u0027No, no medal.\u0027 \u0027So what do you want? Is there another infection? Has it spread?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s still contained,\u0027 O\u0027Driscoll said. \u0027But there\u0027s been a recurrence, yes.\u0027 A recurrence. My blood ran cold. The Purge was supposed to have been the end solution, the final cleansing of what had happened in Usk. Blame went everywhere from the moment it struck, the media filling the channels with political and religious pundits, ex-military personnel and any C-list celebrity who had a fucking opinion. When the military had issued assurances that the Purge would end the slaughter, such assurances were taken as an admission of guilt. How could they know how to stop it if they claimed not to know how it began? \u0027Where?\u0027 I asked. And then a greater chill ran through me, and I couldn\u0027t prevent myself from spinning around. The chopper, the cameras . . . \u0027In the town?\u0027 \u0027No, Mr Parsons. Usk is clear . . . or so we believe. The recurrence was in one of the corpses you brought out.\u0027 \u0027So the infection is still here.\u0027 \u0027We hope not. We hope it was an isolated case, and we\u0027re looking into it. But . . .\u0027 He glanced down at something in his hand. \u0027Okay,\u0027 I said. \u0027So you\u0027re watching us, just in case.\u0027 O\u0027Driscoll nodded, lips pursed. \u0027Just in case.\u0027 \u0027And if we\u0027re still fine a week from now? Two weeks?\u0027 He went to leave. \u0027Hey!\u0027 I called. \u0027You can\u0027t just go!\u0027 He paused, squatting down ready to jump away from the roadblock. He seemed to have nothing else to say. \u0027You can\u0027t just leave us in here like this. We haven\u0027t done anything wrong!\u0027 \u0027But you might,\u0027 he said, and dropped back into his world. I was left staring at the roadblock while the cameras stared back. I gave them the finger. It felt childish, but it made me feel better. Turning to walk back into town, I felt watched every step of the way. As I passed the school, I looked at the low brick building, infant-class windows splashed with colorful drawings. Self-portraits with big round pink faces, bright blue eyes, and smears of yellow or brown hair. If I went closer I\u0027d probably see the names, but I had no wish to do that. I might end up seeing the cartoon face of the little girl we\u0027d left back in the churchyard. The chopper drifted in again, skimming low over the trees beyond the school and disappearing from view. I jogged along the street, eager to see what they were doing, and as I passed the burned-out fire station, I saw through a gap between buildings. The chopper was hovering above the four-storey block of flats - one of the tallest buildings in Usk - and two men were rappelling down a rope to the rooftop. \u0027What the hell . . .\u0027 I muttered. Maybe they wanted us. They\u0027d confine us somewhere, send in their teams of doctors and scientists like O\u0027Driscoll with their syringes and knives, and slice us open one by one to see if they could find out what was happening. Because even if they\u0027d known at the beginning, I had the feeling that they were lost now. The plague had progressed - evolved, perhaps - and with a recurrence somewhere beyond the town\u0027s perimeter, their understanding of whatever caused the plague had lessened considerably. Desperate times called for desperate measures, I knew that. But suddenly I was very, very afraid. We\u0027re expendable, I thought. At least we know the town, the streets, know the places to hide . . . But that was just foolish. If they sent in forces to find us, we would be found. The two men on the roof did not look like they would be here for long. They were setting up a large tripod topped with a box, weighing down the feet, clipping some sort of cover over the box. The chopper had drifted away, but it was merely performing a circuit of the town. More cameras. Even as I realized that, the helicopter came in low and lowered a rope ladder, and the two men climbed back up. I could just see the smooth movement as the camera turned this way and that. Someone back at control was testing it. I waved. Walking back to the Queen\u0027s Hotel, I heard and saw several more choppers coming in. They chose the tallest buildings. \u0027What are they doing?\u0027 Bindy asked as I arrived back. She was sitting on one of the hotel\u0027s wide stone windowsills, waiting for me. For a moment I was irr - itated at her question, but then I sighed softly and sat beside her. \u0027Setting up cameras to try and keep track of us,\u0027 I said. \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s been a recurrence in one of the bodies we took out. I guess they want to watch in case we\u0027re infected too.\u0027 Bindy nodded grimly. \u0027So that\u0027s it then,\u0027 she said, and I couldn\u0027t bring myself to answer. I didn\u0027t want to admit the end of anything. \u0027Where\u0027s Jamie?\u0027 \u0027Went inside. I expect he\u0027s in the bar.\u0027 \u0027Right. I need to tell him what\u0027s going on.\u0027 Bindy stayed where she was, which surprised me a little. I thought she\u0027d latch on to me again like a lost puppy, her eyes wide and expectant. Maybe somewhere she\u0027d found her own strength. \u0027Bindy,\u0027 I said from the main doorway. She glanced at me. \u0027We\u0027ll get out. When they\u0027ve sorted it all, when they know exactly what\u0027s happening.\u0027 \u0027Thanks, Toby,\u0027 she said. Then she looked away again. I went inside to find Jamie. The first plague victim I had seen was an old man who used to run an optician\u0027s office on the main street. He was in the early, raging phase, and he stalked the street, smashing shopwindows with his own hands and head, picking up big shards of glass, and slashing at passersby. This was still early on and, though most people knew that something was wrong with Usk, few knew exactly what. People screamed, the old man shouted and growled, and then he pinned a woman down and started cutting her up. He was completely insane. A teenager smashed him over the head with a golf club, five times. He fell on the bleeding woman and died in the street, and seconds later he hauled himself slowly upright again. The rage was gone now, and he started digging into the woman beneath him for her heart. When I entered the bar, Jamie was raging. My heart stuttered; my balls tingled with fear. I stood back against the wall and watched. Jamie was overturning tables and chairs, smashing bottles, kicking out at the bar, spitting and shouting. This is it, I thought; it\u0027s all over for us now. And suddenly, facing that, I found my purpose again: I could not die here, because I had to find Fiona. As I was backing away, Jamie saw me. He stopped and fell to his knees, crying. \u0027It\u0027s not fair,\u0027 he said. \u0027None of it\u0027s fair.\u0027 I let out a breath, sagging against the wall. Just drunk. Christ. \u0027You heard what I told Bindy.\u0027 \u0027Through the window.\u0027 He lay down among smashed glass on the whiskey-stained carpet, and I left him there. There was little I could do, and for a moment he\u0027d scared the hell out of me. I wondered what they\u0027d do if they saw him raging like that. I went back outside, but Bindy had gone. So I went to look for Fiona. We\u0027d lived in one of eight flats in an old renovated church in the town square, and the building had been gutted the day of the outbreak. Fiona was gone by then, and since the Purge I\u0027d been back into the church three times looking for her body. So I went there again, climbing the warped metal staircase. However hard I tried to avoid touching any surfaces, by the time I reached the first floor, my hands were black with soot. It was as if the air itself was stained. Our flat was at the rear of the church, and I had to pass two others to get there. They were both ruins, and were empty of bodies or bones. I reached the place we had shared and loved, and I was thankful that it looked nothing like home. That would have been hard to take. I felt no hint of nostalgia, because the place was black and burnt and there was little to recognize. The layout was familiar, but even that had changed where walls had burned through and ceilings had fallen. In what had been our bathroom, the floor was gone, and I could see the shattered remains of our bathroom suite in the flat below. In the bedroom, the bed was a charred mound, and none of the wardrobes had survived. I\u0027d done it before, but I sifted again, moving ash and blackened wood around with my feet. Clouds of dust rose up, and soon I knew my vision would be blurred, so I worked quickly. Bedroom, living room, kitchen - there was nothing to suggest that Fiona had been here when the fire broke out. I loved her, but right then I so wanted to find her bones. Leaving the church, I realized that I would never go home again. There was no need, because it was no longer there. So I walked the town once more, looking in places where I had already searched, glancing into gardens which were already becoming overgrown, amazed at the silence of this place. That was something I could not grow used to. Never a particularly busy town, nevertheless there had always been an atmosphere of bustle. The main street was where most of the shops were, and it was forever frequented by the town\u0027s retired contingent going for coffee or their morning papers, and at lunchtime office workers would visit the several restaurants and pubs. In the evenings too it was a lively place, though rarely any more than that. Now, even though the place was not completely silent, it was devoid of the chatter of people. Birds seemed to have taken over. Perhaps their songs had always been there, subsumed beneath the constant rattle of traffic, but now they were given free rein. They lined the rooftops and windowsills, pecked around on the roads, and flitted overhead in manic celebration. It wouldn\u0027t be long, I knew, before Usk began to take on a wild appearance. Always proud of their town, most of the residents had gone to great lengths to make sure their gardens were well planted. Those plants would no longer have to fear the shears or clippers of artifice. \u0027Toby!\u0027 The shout came from far away, the direction confused by echoes. \u0027Bindy?\u0027 \u0027Toby, the river!\u0027 I ran. Past the old law courts, across the parking lot, through an alleyway, and out onto the main street. I was gasping already and cursing the middle-aged spread that I\u0027d willingly let settle. Something for me to hold on to, Fiona had said once as we made love. As I pelted along the road, the river bridge came into view around a curve in the main street. Bindy was standing on it, not far from the block wall, leaning over the stone parapet and looking down. \u0027What is it?\u0027 I called as I ran. She glanced up and pointed. \u0027Jamie!\u0027 I heard his voice then, more drunken shouting and rambling, and if he\u0027d been close to me, I\u0027d have gleefully punched him. He was a tiresome idiot. Am I really trapped here with him for however long? I ran up beside her and looked over the stone parapet. Jamie was down at the river\u0027s edge, and he had something slung over his shoulder. His things? \u0027Don\u0027t be an asshole!\u0027 I shouted. \u0027You get over, they\u0027ll shoot you before-\u0027 \u0027Fuck off,\u0027 he said wearily. \u0027He won\u0027t listen,\u0027 Bindy said. \u0027And he\u0027s not going to swim.\u0027 I realized what he had over his shoulder then - the little dead girl from the churchyard. I climbed onto the parapet and judged the drop. Maybe twelve feet. And if I break my leg? I thought. I\u0027m stuck in Usk with a waitress and a loser, and I\u0027ll end up dying in bed. \u0027Jamie, what are you doing?\u0027 It was a stupid question, because I could already guess. As ever, he was trying to be defiant, because that was the only way he could hide his fear. \u0027Helping her escape,\u0027 he said, giggling. \u0027See how far she\u0027ll get.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re trying to keep this thing contained,\u0027 I said, and I blinked, confused. Did I agree with what they were doing? I hadn\u0027t really given myself time to consider that, not yet. \u0027You\u0027re a pompous shit, Toby. Y\u0027know that? You should listen to yourself sometimes, look at yourself.\u0027 Jamie stepped down the riverbank onto some mud flats. The river rushed by several feet from him. I almost jumped. If I had, perhaps I would have stopped him. But the real reason that kept me up on the bridge was the idea that the trees across the river could be home to snipers. I didn\u0027t want to be close to Jamie when they started shooting. But there was no gunfire as he approached the river, and none as he shrugged the girl off his shoulder and into the mud. Her limbs were still loose, eyes clear. There\u0027s been a recurrence. \u0027Jamie, do you want other people to go through what you\u0027re going through?\u0027 Bindy asked. \u0027Yes,\u0027 Jamie said. He pushed the child into the water. I winced, expecting gunfire, and as we watched her float away, I realized that I had failed. I was a coward. A jump, a punch, and I could have stopped him. \u0027Fuck,\u0027 I said. \u0027Yes, \u0027cause if I have to go through it, why shouldn\u0027t other people?\u0027 There wasn\u0027t an ounce of regret in his voice. In fact, I thought I heard an element of glee as he giggled again, took a half bottle of whiskey from a pocket in his cargo pants, and started drinking. \u0027You\u0027re a fucking idiot, Jamie,\u0027 Bindy said, \u0027and you\u0027ll get us all killed.\u0027 She was watching the little girl carried out by the river. The water flow was quite fast here after being channeled through the bridge\u0027s three arches, and the body started to turn as it moved downriver, spinning clockwise with arms and legs splayed, hair billowing out around it. The dust will be washed from her eyes now, I thought. A tree overhanging the river snagged her clothing for a beat, but then she moved on, and soon she was out of sight around a bend. I realized that Jamie had already walked back up the bank and skirted around the old tollhouse at the bridge\u0027s end. He was heading back along the main street, bottle clasped loose in one hand, and he swayed slightly as he walked. Still drunk. Jamie would always be drunk, and I wondered how much worse he\u0027d be sober. \u0027What do we do now?\u0027 Bindy asked. She had moved closer to me, and she reached out as she spoke. I took her hand. \u0027Just carry on,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m still looking.\u0027 \u0027But if you do find her-\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m still looking.\u0027 I let go of Bindy and started following Jamie. \u0027You\u0027re not, in case you were wondering,\u0027 she said, as she followed on behind. \u0027Not what?\u0027 \u0027A pompous shit.\u0027 I shrugged as if I didn\u0027t care. Jamie was sitting on the curb close to the post office, a stupid grin on his face. Waiting for us. Waiting to gloat. \u0027What?\u0027 Bindy said. I cursed her silently for encouraging him. \u0027Showed them,\u0027 he said. He laughed, but I detected an uncertainty in him. The laughter was there to cover that, perhaps for himself. \u0027Yes, you really showed them, Jamie,\u0027 I said. \u0027They\u0027re sure to buck up their ideas and let us leave now. Prick.\u0027 He went to stand, swayed, and I saw violence cloud his face. I didn\u0027t want to fight him, because I\u0027d never been a fighter. But I realized it was something else that would come between him and his uncertainty, and he was set on the course now. He threw his empty bottle away and took a step toward me, and then the chopper came. \u0027What do they want now?\u0027 Jamie said. He sounded scared. \u0027Stay where you are,\u0027 that mechanical voice instructed. \u0027Lecture,\u0027 I said. \u0027We\u0027re their pets, and they\u0027re going to give us a good talking-to.\u0027 I was right. But they didn\u0027t say another word. Instead, as the chopper hovered just above the buildings fifty yards along the street from us, a man leaned out with something in his hand. Camera and microphone, I thought, and then Jamie flipped back onto the pavement, blood spewing from his throat just below his Adam\u0027s apple. His eyes were wide, hands waving like separate animals as they tried to find the wound, and before they could, a second shot rang out. This one was right on target, and the top and back of his head splashed across the post office\u0027s front steps. The helicopter left. Bindy had turned away, but I couldn\u0027t help but look. I\u0027d seen a lot of death, but there was something worse about this one. For a few seconds, as blood dripped, his left foot twitched, and his eyes slowly turned up in his head. I couldn\u0027t work out what it was. \u0027And then there were two!\u0027 Bindy said, verging on hysteria. And that was it. Because inside I knew we\u0027d be in here for a very long time, and prick though he was, Jamie was company. And prick though I was, distant and aloof, I knew I could never hope to survive this on my own. I went to Bindy and held her, and this time it was me taking comfort from the contact as well. She felt warm and alive, and I held on to that with everything I had. That night, Bindy moved into my room at the hotel. I did not object, and she didn\u0027t ask. She simply dropped her small bag of belongings next to mine, stripped to her underwear, and climbed into bed. I put my arm around her shoulders, and she rested her head on my chest, and soon she was asleep. There was nothing sexual at all. I smelled her, felt her heat, felt her heavy breasts pressed against my side, but I didn\u0027t stir. This was pure survival instinct, and though we didn\u0027t need each other\u0027s bodily warmth, there was so much more to share. The next day we went about burying Jamie. I tied a bag around his head so that we didn\u0027t have to look at where wildlife had been picking at him. Bindy broke into a hardware and do-it-yourself store to find a shovel and pick. We carried him together across the main street and through a small alley that led to a pub garden. There were rose beds here, so the ground was still quite soft even in the summer heat, and I saw no reason to carry him all the way to the church. We took turns digging. While Bindy dug, I squatted and watched her. There had never been any attraction - and the thought of betraying Fiona\u0027s memory was terrible to me - but for the first time I realized what a striking young woman she was. Perhaps fear took this away from her, but now, digging in shorts and a vest top, sweating in the morning sun, mud streaked up her legs, she was quite beautiful. I enjoyed watching her, and that enjoyment ceased only when I saw movement from Jamie\u0027s body. I gasped, stood upright, and saw sparrows flitter away from his bloodied chest. Only them, I thought; it was only them. But when it was my turn to dig again, I used the pick and made sure we planted him deep. It took a couple of hours, and halfway through, Bindy went to the shop and came back with a couple of bottles of water. The shop stank now - so much stuff in there had rotted, its stink was rank and stale - but there was enough canned and bottled goods to see us through for a long time. \u0027Are we going to be here forever?\u0027 she asked, as I shoveled dirt in on top of Jamie. I paused, panting and sweating hard, and leaned on the shovel. She doesn\u0027t seem so scared now, I thought. And there was something changed about her. Maybe it was because Jamie had gone, or perhaps it was the simple fact that we\u0027d slept comforting each other, holding the nightmares at bay. \u0027Maybe,\u0027 I said. \u0027Or at least until they know exactly what happened here.\u0027 Past her head I could see one of the camera tripods on a building\u0027s rooftop. Soon, it wouldn\u0027t be long before they could watch us almost anywhere if we were outside. Bindy nodded, then looked down at Jamie\u0027s grave. \u0027We\u0027ll be okay,\u0027 she said, and she sounded so certain that I wondered if she\u0027d been stronger than me all along. The he licopter overflew the town all day, turning a tight circle several times if it saw us in the street. It dropped those two men down a few times, letting them set up other cameras before lifting them away again. I supposed we could have gone to those buildings and smashed up the cameras, but maybe there would be a punishment for that. These people seemed keen to keep their own special lab rats under control. Bindy helped me look for Fiona. I couldn\u0027t find it in me to say I wanted to do it on my own. Then after we stopped for lunch, I realized that I wanted her with me. She was good company; she seemed to have taken her fear under control; and I found myself stealing more glances at her as we walked. I really am a pompous shit, I thought, because I\u0027d never given myself a chance to know this woman at all. We started going into houses we hadn\u0027t had a chance to explore before, and we found the remains of eight people. None of them were zombies, that we could tell: Rot had taken them all, and some of them were badly mauled and chewed, their bones and remains strewn around. None of them was Fiona. I went to great pains to sift through the remains, gagging, puking several times when the smell became too much, and I never found anything of her I recognized. No jewelry, no hair, no clothing. It was a continuation of the most terrible thing I had ever done - we\u0027d been shifting and hauling bodies for three weeks - but I had to make sure. Bindy came with me every time, but she always stayed outside those rooms. I could not blame her at all, though as time went on that day, I found myself missing her company more and more, as I moved splintered bones and stinking things aside. By early evening we were exhausted, and we went back to the hotel. They\u0027d been there while we were away and installed cameras in the upper corners of the hallway, bar, kitchen, pantry, and the corridor upstairs outside our room. Greasy footprints marked their route up and down the stair carpet, and I was outraged at them for not removing their boots. \u0027They\u0027re really interested in what happens to us,\u0027 she said, as if truly realizing our predicament for the first time. I nodded, not wanting to speak. They\u0027re watching us right now. Maybe O\u0027Driscoll is with them, drinking good coffee, eating a doughnut, and they\u0027ll be looking for signs of infection or madness or rage. I had no wish to say anything to them, so I motioned for Bindy to come into our room. I spent some time looking around for cameras and microphones. Would they really have any respect for our privacy? There were no bootprints on our light room carpet, but maybe that was just them being sly. I could find nothing - no cameras, whose presence would have been obvious, and no microphones either. I actually caught Bindy smiling as I looked inside the lamp shades and behind the mirror, and I smiled back, remembering what I\u0027d said to O\u0027Driscoll. What movie do you think you\u0027re in? We ate downstairs in the bar, sharing a bottle of wine, and it was the most relaxed meal we\u0027d had since being thrown together by this. Jamie\u0027s agitated presence had always been a pressure, but something about Bindy had changed. I thought that Jamie being gone perhaps allowed her to assess her panics and fears without his own stoking them. We slept in the same bed again that night, sharing comfort, relishing contact. Though I was aware of the heat of her more than before, and the feel of her molded to me, still there was no tension at all. I appreciated that, and I fell asleep dreaming of Fiona planting roses in our garden, laughing, and wiping dust out of her eyes with delicate thumbs. The helicopter didn\u0027t come the next day. As we continued our search through the deserted town and the sun reached its zenith, I saw a column of smoke rising far in the distance. \u0027Is that another cremation pit?\u0027 Bindy asked. \u0027I don\u0027t think so. Something about it\u0027s different.\u0027 \u0027How do you mean?\u0027 She came closer and held my hand. \u0027It\u0027s a long way away.\u0027 She squeezed. The implications of that did not need stating. It was a wide column, and high, and if it was several miles distant, the fire must be huge. When I said that I was going to the edge of town to see what I could see, she shook her head and backed away from me. \u0027I don\u0027t want to see,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t want to know.\u0027 \u0027Bindy, the chopper hasn\u0027t been around this morning.\u0027 She nodded, looking away from me. \u0027And you\u0027ve noticed the cameras?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 They weren\u0027t turning to follow our progress. I\u0027d been keeping a wary eye on them since I noticed that, first thing in the morning, but I hadn\u0027t wanted to mention it to her. \u0027We have to know.\u0027 She was shaking her head, but there were no tears. She was far from the Bindy she\u0027d been just a couple of days before. Now I saw calculation and consideration in her eyes, not blind panic. \u0027I have to know.\u0027 I went to her and held her, and she was hot, her skin already tacky with sweat. It was the hottest day I could remember, and I felt a rush of affection for her then. I kissed the side of her head, she kissed my shoulder, and we both hugged tighter. \u0027I\u0027m going to keep looking,\u0027 she said, nodding toward the street we\u0027d been searching. They were big houses, and there were five left on this row. \u0027You\u0027re sure?\u0027 She touched the claw hammer she carried in her belt. We\u0027d both agreed that it would be handy for breaking the locks out of doors, but it didn\u0027t need saying that it was also a weapon. \u0027I won\u0027t be long,\u0027 I said, but that turned out to be a lie. It would be eve ning before I saw Bindy again, and by then our whole world had changed once more. I went back toward the roadblock by the school. I stood there shouting for a while, waving at the cameras, trying to get their attention, stepping left and right across the road. The cameras did not follow my progress. \u0027I need to speak with O\u0027Driscoll!\u0027 I shouted. Silence was my answer. In the distance to the south, beyond a range of hills, the column of smoke still rose. It could have been Cwmbran several miles away, or maybe Newport, several miles farther. Whichever it was, I judged its fiery base to be miles wide. Waving at the cameras was stupid. There was no one there to see. So I climbed the roadblock and started walking along the road. To begin with, I cursed myself with every step, knowing how foolish I was being, wincing at the expectation of a high-powered rifle shot. I\u0027ll be hit before I even hear the shot, I thought, and that was no comfort at all. But there was no gunfire, no helicopters, and no loud mechanical voices exhorting me to \u0027Please don\u0027t attempt escape.\u0027 Right then there was nothing I wanted to hear more. The road ran for a mile before splitting and filtering down onto a dual highway heading north and south. It was deserted and quiet, save for the wildlife that was becoming braver day by day: I saw a fox watching me from a large house\u0027s garden, and a buzzard sat on the road eating something it had just caught, not even glancing up at me as I passed within fifteen feet of it. I tried to identify what it was eating, but I could not. There was no fur. I saw them from far away. I knew what they were. And I gave thanks to gods I had never believed in that the military had seen fit to erect a second line of protection. The fence spanned the road just before it split to curve down to the highway. It was high, heavy-duty, and I could track its route across fields and in front of a distant copse of trees, curving around the north end of the town. In the other direction it was soon lost to view, but I hoped it was just as long, and just as strong. I sat down in the road and watched them pressing against it. Most of them wore army uniforms, those who weren\u0027t in underwear or naked. Many bore terrible wounds, and the blood still flowed. Dead blood must have been different, though, because its stench did not attract their brethren. A zombie\u0027s heart, it seemed, did not taste so sweet. There were maybe fifty of them. Most were clumped against the section of fence built across the road, but I saw a few down in the fields as well. One of those still seemed to be carrying a rifle across his back, though now I hoped he no longer remembered how to use it. They were making very little noise. A few moans and groans, but none of the raging growls that had marked the first phase of infection. All these were past that now. They\u0027d gone mad and killed and died, and now they were back again, and all they saw when they looked at me was my succulent still-beating heart. There\u0027s been a recurrence, O\u0027Driscoll had said. Smug prick. I looked for him but didn\u0027t see him. I hoped he\u0027d been killed and torn apart, found true death, because however much I hated him, I\u0027d had contact with him, and he was a human being like me. He was only doing what he thought was right, and this was no way to end up. I tried to make out exactly what this meant. The Purge had worked in Usk, for a while at least, and now that there had been an outbreak beyond the town, surely the military would launch another Purge . . .? But there was no sound of vehicles anywhere, neither ground nor air, and I could see no plane trails in the sky. And there was that burning city. I sat and watched them for a while, trying not to appreciate the stark truth of things - that this plague had gone farther, and perhaps was still traveling. Then I knew what I had to do before returning to Bindy, because I couldn\u0027t go back to her with half-truths and suppositions. I had to make sure that we were safe and that our prison had become our refuge. I walked north first of all, following the fence all around the town until it reached the river. I looked into the town at the stone bridge, and from here I could just see the clumsy block barrier that they\u0027d built at its center. The fence extended right across the river and continued on the other side, obviously encompassing what had been their encampment. I followed the fence back around the town, crossing the road where most of them were still gathered. They pushed and shoved, but the fence was solid, and they had no real strength. A mile to the south of town I saw O\u0027Driscoll. He was naked, and his entire front was a mass of dried blood. I couldn\u0027t make out whether or not it was his own, and I gave him a wide berth. He leaned against the metal upright, banging his head rhythmically against it as he watched me pass. The fence reached the river on that side too and crossed over, and I knew I had to swim over to make sure. I half-swam, half-walked, and on the other side, where their encampment had been, I found that the fence only enclosed a small part of it. Gates were built in at two points, both of them padlocked and chained. I\u0027d found no breaches and no areas where any of them could climb over. The military had been very thorough and determined to keep us in and, as I forded the river again and walked back into town, I thanked them for that. It was a good thing they\u0027d realized how dangerous we could be. Bindy was in the hotel bar, sipping nervously from a glass of wine. When I entered she jumped up and ran to me, cursing and crying and wrapping her arms around my neck. \u0027Where the fucking hell have you been?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re all I\u0027ve got, Toby; you\u0027re all that\u0027s left. Don\u0027t you dare scare me like that again, ever!\u0027 She pulled back and held my face, staring into my eyes, and I realized something both striking and comforting then: in her own quiet way, Bindy was in charge. \u0027I won\u0027t,\u0027 I said. She held me tightly again, and I hugged her back. \u0027You\u0027re all I\u0027ve got too, Bindy.\u0027 She pulled away, stalked back to the bar, poured some drinks. She wouldn\u0027t catch my eye. \u0027It\u0027s spread outside,\u0027 I said. \u0027I know. I guessed. I walked and saw the fence, and some of . . . them.\u0027 \u0027That big fire\u0027s still burning.\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 \u0027Maybe they\u0027ll starve.\u0027 We sat down together and drank, shoulder to shoulder on a leather sofa, the contact so important. There was so much more that needed to be said, but I knew it could wait. We both realized the truth - that our entrapment had become the only freedom left. Later, just before midnight, I asked her what she\u0027d found as she continued searching the big houses on that street. Her hesitation was just too long for me to ignore, and she would not meet my eyes. But when she said \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I nodded and let it stand. For then, at least. That night in bed, we began our future together. It was beautiful and intense, and I think the passion came more from our continuing freedom than anything else. I should have felt guilt, but there was none, because the past was now so far away and obscure that it felt like someone else\u0027s memories. Maybe in the daylight things would be different, but then it felt so right. Afterward, lying in the dark listening to a silence that would become the norm, she told me. \u0027I found her,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027In the last house. I nailed the doors shut.\u0027 \u0027Good.\u0027 \u0027So . . .?\u0027 \u0027Tomorrow, yes. We\u0027ll go and set a fire.\u0027 I did not sleep at all that night. The fear was there that we had left it too late, and I listened every second for sounds that did not come - the creaking of footsteps on the stairs, the low grumbling of my wife come to berate me and regain my heart. Even though she said nothing, I knew that Bindy remained awake as well. She was looking after me.

The hungry dead have risen. They shamble down the street. They hide in back yards, car lots, shopping malls. They devour neighbors, dogs and police officers. And they are here to stay. The real question is, what are you going to do about it? How will you survive? How will the world change when the dead begin to rise? Stoker-award-winning author Christopher Golden has assembled an original anthology of never-before-published zombie stories from an eclectic array of today\u0027s hottest writers. Inside there are stories about military might in the wake of an outbreak, survival in a wasted wasteland, the ardor of falling in love with a zombie, and a family outing at the circus. Here is a collection of new views on death and resurrection. With stories from Joe Hill, John Connolly, Max Brooks, Kelley Armstrong, Tad Williams, David Wellington, David Liss, Aimee Bender, Jonathan Maberry, and many others, this is a wildly diverse and entertaining collection... the last word on The New Dead.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology.jpg","author":"Christopher Golden","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:34:57 PM"}}
