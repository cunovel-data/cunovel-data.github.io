{"id":81268,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"BY TAD WILLIAMS\n Nightingale did not take the first cab he saw when he stepped out into the rainy San Francisco streets. He never did. Some might call it superstition, but in his profession the line between superstitions and rules of survival was rather slender. He stepped back onto the curb to avoid the spray of water as the second cab pulled up in response to his wave. Paranormal investigators didn\u0027t make enough money to ruin a pair of good shoes for no reason.\n Somebody should have warned me that saving the world from unspeakable horrors is like being a teacher - lots of job satisfaction, but the money\u0027s crap.\n \u0027Thirty-three Gilman Street,\u0027 he told the driver, an ex-hippie on the edge of retirement age, with shoulder-length grey hair straggling out from under his Kangol hat and several silver rings on the fingers holding the wheel. \u0027It\u0027s off Jones.\u0027\n \u0027You got it.\u0027 The driver pulled back into traffic, wipers squeaking as city lights smeared and dribbled across the glass beside Nightingale\u0027s head. \u0027Helluva night,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know we need the rain and everything, but . . . shit, man.\u0027\n Nathan Nightingale had spent so much of the past week in a small overheated and nearly airless room that he would have happily run through this downpour naked, but he only nodded and said, \u0027Yeah. Helluva night.\u0027\n \u0027Gonna be a lot more before it\u0027s over, too. That\u0027s what they said. The storm door\u0027s open.\u0027 The driver turned down the music a notch. \u0027Kind of a weird expression, huh? Makes it sound like they\u0027re\u0027 - he lifted his fingers in twitching monster-movie talons - \u0027coming to get us. Whooo! I mean, it\u0027s just clouds, right? It\u0027s nature.\u0027\n \u0027This? Yeah, it\u0027s just nature,\u0027 agreed Nightingale, his thoughts already drawn back to that small room, those clear, calm, terrifying eyes. \u0027But sometimes even nature can be unnatural.\u0027\n \u0027Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess so. Good one.\u0027 But it was clear by his tone that the driver feared he\u0027d missed the point.\n \u0027That\u0027s it - the tall house there.\u0027\n The driver peered out the window. \u0027Whoa, that\u0027s a spooky one, man. You sure you gonna be okay? This is kind of a tough neighborhood.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll be fine, thanks,\u0027 said Nightingale. \u0027I\u0027ve been here before; it was kind of my second home.\u0027\n \u0027If you say so.\u0027 The driver called just before Nightingale slammed the door, \u0027Hey, remember about that storm door. Better get an umbrella!\u0027\n Nightingale raised his hand as the man drove off. An umbrella. He almost smiled, but the wet night was getting to him. If only all problems were that easy to solve.\n As he pressed the button beside the mailbox, lightning blazed overhead, making it seem as though one had caused the other. A moment later the thunder crashed down so near that he did not hear the sound of the door being buzzed open but felt the handle vibrating under his hand.\n The light was out in the first- floor stairwell, and no lights were on at all on the second floor, what Uncle Edward called \u0027the showroom\u0027, although no one ever saw it but a few old, trusted collector friends. Enough of the streetlight\u0027s glow leaked in that Nightingale could see the strange silhouettes of some of the old man\u0027s prize possessions - fetish dolls and funerary votives and terra-cotta tomb statuettes, a vast audience of silent, wide-eyed shapes watching Nightingale climb the stairs. It was an excellent collection, but what made it truly astounding were the stories behind the pieces, most of them dark, many of them horrifying. In fact, it had been his godfather\u0027s arcane tales and bizarre trophies that had first lured Nightingale onto his odd career path: at an age when most boys wanted to be football players or firemen, young Nate had decided he wanted to hunt ghosts and fight demons. Later, when others were celebrating their first college beer-busts, Nightingale had already attended strange ceremonies on high English moors and deep in Thai jungles and Louisiana bayous. He had heard languages never shaped for the use of human tongues, had seen men die for no reason and others live when they should have been dead. But through the years, when the unnatural things he saw and felt and learned overwhelmed him, he always came back here for his godfather\u0027s advice and support. This was one of those times. In fact, this was probably the worst time he could remember.\n Strangely, the third floor of the house was dark, too.\n \u0027Edward? Uncle Edward? It\u0027s me, Nathan. Are you here?\u0027 Had the old man forgotten he was coming and gone out with his caretaker Jenkins somewhere? God forbid, a medical emergency . . . Nightingale stopped to listen. Was that the quiet murmuring of the old man\u0027s breathing machine?\n Something stirred on the far side of the room, and his hackles rose; his hand strayed to his inside coat pocket. A moment later the desk lamp clicked on, revealing the thin, lined face of his godfather squinting against the sudden light. \u0027Oh,\u0027 Edward said, taking a moment to find the air to speak. \u0027Guh-goodness! Nate, is that you? I must have dozed off. When did it get so dark?\u0027\n Relieved, Nightingale went to the old man and gave him a quick hug, being careful not to disturb the tracheotomy cannula or the ventilator tubes. As always, Edward Arvedson felt like little more than a suit full of bones, but somehow he had survived in this failing condition for almost a decade. \u0027Where\u0027s Jenkins?\u0027 Nightingale asked. \u0027It gave me a start when I came up and the whole house was dark.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I had him take the night off, poor fellow. Working himself to death. Pour me a small sherry, will you? - there\u0027s a good man - and sit down and tell me what you\u0027ve learned. There should be a bottle of Manzanilla already open. No, don\u0027t turn all those other lights on. I find I\u0027m very sensitive at the moment. This is enough light for you to find your way to the wet bar, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Nightingale smiled. \u0027I could find it without any light at all, Uncle Edward.\u0027\n When he\u0027d poured a half glass for the old man and a little for himself as well, Nightingale settled into the chair facing the desk and looked his mentor up and down. \u0027How are you feeling?\u0027\n Arvedson waved a dismissive hand. \u0027Fine, fine. Never felt better. And now that we\u0027re done with that nonsense, tell me your news, Nate. What happened? I\u0027ve been worrying ever since you told me what you thought was going on.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it took me a while to find a volunteer. Mostly because I was trying to avoid publicity, you know, all that \"Nightingale, Exorcist to the Stars\" nonsense.\u0027\n \u0027You shouldn\u0027t have changed your name: it sounds like a Hollywood actor now. Your parents wouldn\u0027t have approved, anyway. What was wrong with Natan Naktergal? It was good enough for your father.\u0027\n He smiled. \u0027Too old country, Uncle Edward. Remember, being well- known gets me into a lot of places. It also leads people to misjudge me.\u0027\n Arvedson made a face. He still hadn\u0027t touched his sherry. \u0027Fine. I\u0027m also old country, I suppose. I should be grateful you even visit. Tell me what happened.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m trying to. As I said, it wouldn\u0027t have done to recruit just anyone. Ideally, I needed someone with special training, but who gets trained for something like this? I figured that my best bet was through my Tibetan contacts. Tibetan Buddhists spend years studying the Bardo Thodol, preparing to take the journey of dying, which gave me a much larger group to choose from. I finally settled on a man in Seattle named Geshe, who had pancreatic cancer. He\u0027d refused pain relief, and the doctors felt certain he only had a few days left when I met him, but he was remarkably calm and thoughtful. I told him what I wanted and why, and he said yes.\u0027\n \u0027So you had found your . . . what was your word? Your \"necronaut\".\u0027\n Nightingale nodded. \u0027That\u0027s what I called it before I met Geshe - it sounded better than \"mineshaft canary\". After I got to know him it, it seemed a little glib. But he was precisely the sort of person I was looking for - a man trained almost since childhood to die with his eyes and mind open.\u0027\n Lightning flashed and a peal of thunder shivered the windows. In the wake, another wash of rain splattered against the glass. \u0027Filthy weather,\u0027 said Arvedson. \u0027Do you want another drink before you start? You\u0027ll have to get it yourself, of course, since we don\u0027t have Jenkins.\u0027\n \u0027No, I\u0027m fine.\u0027 Nightingale stared at his glass. \u0027I\u0027m just thinking.\u0027 Lightning flashed again, and so he waited for the thunder before continuing. \u0027You remember how this started, of course. Those earliest reports of spontaneous recovery by dying patients. Well, it didn\u0027t seem like anything I needed to pay attention to. But then that one family whose daughter went into sudden remission from leukemia after the last rites had already been said-\u0027\n \u0027I remember. Very young, wasn\u0027t she? Nine?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, a few weeks before her tenth birthday. But of course what caught my attention was when the parents started claiming it wasn\u0027t their daughter at all, that she\u0027d changed in ways that no illness could explain. But when I got in to see the child, she was asleep, and although she looked surprisingly healthy compared to my general experience with possession cases, I couldn\u0027t get any kind of feeling from her one way or another. When I tried to contact the family a few days later, they\u0027d moved and no one could find them.\n \u0027There were others too, too many to be coincidence, most of them unknown to the general public. The greatest hindrance in these situations is the gutter press, of course: Any real study, let alone any chance to help the victims and their families, is destroyed by the sort of circus they create. These days, with television and the Internet, it\u0027s even worse. If I don\u0027t strenuously keep my comings and goings a secret, I wind up with cameras in my face following me everywhere and looking over my shoulder.\u0027\n \u0027They are vermin,\u0027 said Edward Arvedson with feeling.\n \u0027In any case, when I talked to you, I had just learned of an accident victim in Minnesota who had recovered from a coma and, like the girl in Southern California, seemed to have undergone a complete personality shift. He had been a mild and soft-spoken churchgoer, but now he was a violent, alcoholic bully. His wife of twenty-four years had divorced him; his children no longer saw him. The front yard of his house in Bloomington was a wreck, and when he opened the door, the stink of rot and filth just rolled out. I only saw him for a few seconds through the chain on his front door, but what I witnessed was definitely madness, a sort of . . . emotionless focus that I\u0027ve only seen in the criminally insane. That doesn\u0027t prove anything, of course. Brain damage can do that, and he\u0027d certainly been badly injured. But he recognized me.\u0027\n \u0027You told me when you called,\u0027 said Arvedson. \u0027I could tell it upset you.\u0027\n \u0027Because it wasn\u0027t like he\u0027d seen my picture in the Enquirer, but like he knew me. Knew me and hated me. I didn\u0027t stay there long, but it wasn\u0027t just seeing the Minnesota victim that threw me. I\u0027d never heard of possessions happening at this rate, or to people so close to death. It didn\u0027t make sense!\u0027\n \u0027It has my attention, too,\u0027 Edward said. \u0027But what I want to hear now is what happened with your Buddhist gentleman.\u0027\n Nightingale let out a breath. He swallowed the last of his sherry. \u0027Right. Well, Geshe was a very interesting man, an artist and a teacher. I wish I could have met him at a different time, but even in our short acquaintance he impressed me and I liked him. That\u0027s why what happened was so disturbing.\n \u0027He had checked out of the hospital to die at home. He\u0027d lost his wife a few years earlier and they\u0027d had no children, so although some of his students and colleagues came by to sit with him from time to time, at the end there was only his friend Joseph, an American Buddhist, and the hospice nurse who checked in on him once a day. And me, of course. Geshe and I didn\u0027t speak much - he had to work too hard to manage the pain - but as I said, he impressed me. During the long days in his apartment, I spent a great deal of time looking at his books and other possessions, which is as good a way to get to know someone as talking with them. Also, I saw many of his own works of art, which may be an even better way to learn about another human being. He made beautiful Buddhist thangkas, meditation paintings.\n \u0027As Geshe began to slip away, Joseph read the Bardo Thodol to him. I\u0027ve never spent much time studying it, myself. I think that hippie- ish Tibetan Book of the Dead reputation put me off when I was younger, and these days I don\u0027t really need to know the nuts and bolts of any particular religious dogma to work with the universal truths behind them all. But I have to say that hearing it and living with it, even as Geshe was dying with it, opened my eyes.\u0027\n \u0027There is great truth at the heart of all the great faiths,\u0027 Arvedson said solemnly.\n \u0027Yes, but what I truly came to admire was the calmness of the people who wrote the bardos - the practicality, I suppose, is the best word. It\u0027s a very practical book, the Bardo Thodol. A road map. A set of travel tips. \"Here\u0027s what\u0027s going to happen now that you\u0027re dead. Do this. Don\u0027t do that. Everything will be okay.\" Except that this time it wasn\u0027t.\n \u0027The famous teacher Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche said the best thing we can do for the dying and the newly dead is maintain an atmosphere of calmness, and that\u0027s certainly what Geshe seemed to have around him at the end. It was raining outside most of that week, but quietly. Joseph read the bardos over and over while he and I took turns holding Geshe\u0027s hand. With my special sensitivities, I was beginning to sense something of what he was sensing - the approach of the Great Mystery, the crossing, whatever you want to call it - and of course it troubled me deep down in my bones and guts. But Geshe wasn\u0027t frightened in the least. All those years of training and meditation had prepared him.\n \u0027It was fascinating to see how the dying soul colors the experience, Uncle Edward. As I said, I have never delved too deeply into Tibetan Buddhism, yet the version of dying I experienced through Geshe was shaped so strongly by that tradition that I could not feel it any other way. It was as real as you and I sitting here in the dark, listening to the wind and the rain.\u0027 Nightingale paused for a moment while the storm rattled the windows of the old house. \u0027The thousands of gods, which are one god, which is the light of the universe . . . I can\u0027t explain. But touching Geshe\u0027s thoughts as he began his journey - although I felt only the barest hint of what he felt - was like riding a roller coaster through a kaleidoscope, but simultaneously falling through an endless, dark, silent void.\u0027\n \u0027 \"When your body and mind separate, the dharmata will appear, pure and clear yet hard to discern, luminous and brilliant, with terrifying brightness, shimmering like a mirage on a plain,\"\u0027 Arvedson quoted. \u0027At least, that\u0027s what the bardo says.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 Nightingale nodded. \u0027I remember hearing it then and understanding it clearly, even though the words I heard were Tibetan. Joseph had begun the Chikkhai bardo, you see - the bardo of dying. In the real world, as we sometimes think of it, Geshe had sunk so far into himself he was no longer visibly breathing. But I was not really beside him in that little room in Seattle, although I could still hear Joseph\u0027s voice. Most of me was inside - deep in the experience of death with Geshe.\n \u0027I could feel him, Uncle Edward, and in a way I could see what he saw, hear what he heard, although those aren\u0027t quite the right words. As the voices of people I did not know echoed around us - mostly Geshe\u0027s friends and relations and loved ones, I suspect, for I do not think he had many enemies - he and I traveled together through a misty forest. It seemed to me a bit like some of the wild lands of the Pacific Northwest, but more mountainous, as if some of Geshe\u0027s Tibetan heritage was seeping through as well.\u0027\n \u0027Climbing,\u0027 said Edward Arvedson quietly.\n \u0027Yes, the part of the afterlife journey the Egyptians called \"the Ladder\" and the Aztecs thought of as the beginning of the soul\u0027s four-year journey to Mictlan. I\u0027ve never dared hold a connection with a dying soul as long as I did with Geshe, and going so deep frightened me, but his calm strength made it possible. We did not speak, of course - his journey, his encounters, were his alone, as each of ours will be someday - but I felt him there beside me as the dark drew in.\n \u0027I won\u0027t tell you everything I experienced now, but I will tell you someday soon, because it was a researcher\u0027s dream come true - the death experience almost firsthand. To make the story short, we passed through the first darkness and saw the first light, which the bardos call the soft light of the gods and which they counsel the dead soul to avoid. It was very attractive, like a warm fire to someone lost in the night, and I was feeling very cold, very far from comfort and familiar things - and remember, I had a body to go back to! I can only imagine what it seemed like to Geshe, who was on a one-way journey, but he resisted it. The same with what the bardo calls the \"soft light of the hell-beings\". I could feel him yearning toward it, and even to me it seemed soothing, alluring. In the oldest Tibetan tradition, the hot hells are full of terrors - forests of razor-leaved trees, swamps bobbing with decomposing corpses - but these aspects are never seen until it\u0027s too late, until the attractions of one\u0027s own greed and anger have pulled the dying soul off the path.\n \u0027But Geshe overcame these temptations and kept on moving toward the harsher light of truth. He was brave, Edward, so brave! But then we reached the smoky yellow light, the realm of what the bardo calls pretas-\u0027\n \u0027The hungry ghosts.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, the hungry ghosts. Found in almost every human tradition. Those who did not go on. Those who can\u0027t let go of anger, hatred, obsession . . .\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps simply those who want more life,\u0027 Arvedson suggested.\n Nightingale shook his head. \u0027That makes them sound innocent, but they\u0027re far from that. Corpse-eating jikininki, ancient Rome\u0027s lemures, the grigori of the Book of Enoch - almost every human tradition has them. Hell, I\u0027ve met them, although never in their own backyard like this. You remember that thing that almost killed me in Freiberg?\u0027\n \u0027I certainly do.\u0027\n \u0027That was one of them, hitchhiking a ride in a living body. Nearly ripped my head off before I got away. I still have the scars.\u0027\n The nighttime city waited now between waves of the storm. For a moment it was quiet enough in the room for Nightingale to hear the fan of his godfather\u0027s ventilator.\n \u0027In any case, that smoky yellow light terrified me. The bardo says it\u0027s temptation itself, that light, but maybe it didn\u0027t tempt me because I wasn\u0027t dying. Instead it just made me feel frightened and sick, if you can be sick without a body. I could barely sense Geshe, but I knew he was there and experiencing something very different. Instead of continuing toward the brilliant white light of compassion, as the bardo instructed, this very compassionate man seemed to hesitate. The yellow light was spreading around us like something toxic diffusing through water. Geshe seemed confused, stuck, as though he fought against a call much stronger than anything I could sense. I could feel something else too, something alien to both of us, cold and strong and . . . yes, and hungry. God, I\u0027ve never sensed hunger like that, a bottomless need like the empty chill of space sucking away all living warmth.\u0027\n Nightingale sat quietly for a long moment before he spoke again. \u0027But then, just when I was fighting hardest to hang on to my connection to Geshe, it dissolved and he was gone. I\u0027d lost touch with him. The yellow light was all around me, strange and greasy . . . repulsive, but also overwhelming.\n \u0027I fell out. No, it was more like I was shoved. I tumbled back into the real world, back into my body. I couldn\u0027t feel Geshe any more. Joseph had stopped reading the Chikkhai bardo and was staring in alarm. Geshe\u0027s body, which hadn\u0027t moved or showed any signs of life in some time, was suddenly in full-on Cheyne-Stokes respiration, chest hitching, body jerking: he almost looked like he was convulsing. But Joseph swore to me later on that Geshe had stopped breathing half an hour earlier, and I believe him.\n \u0027A moment later Geshe\u0027s eyes popped open. I\u0027ve seen stranger things, but it still startled me. He had been dead, Uncle Edward, really dead, I swear he had. Now he was looking at me - but it wasn\u0027t Geshe any more. I couldn\u0027t prove it, of course, but I had touched this man\u0027s soul, traveled with him as he passed over, the most intimate thing imaginable, and this just wasn\u0027t him.\n \u0027\"No, I will not die yet,\" he said. The voice sounded like his, but strong, far too strong for someone who had been in periodic breathing only a minute earlier. \"There are still things for me to do on this earth,\" he said. It was the eyes, though. That same cold, flat stare that I\u0027d seen through the doorway in Minnesota, the one I\u0027ve seen before in other possession cases, but there was none of the struggle I\u0027d seen in classic possession, no sense of the soul and body fighting against an interloper. One moment it was Geshe, a spiritual man, an artist; the next moment it was . . . someone else. Someone as cold and detached as a textbook sociopath.\n \u0027He closed his eyes then and slept, or pretended to, but already he looked healthier than he had since I met him. I couldn\u0027t tell Joseph that I thought his friend was possessed - what a horrible thing to say to someone already dealing with several kinds of trauma! - and I didn\u0027t know what else to do, what to think. I sat there for most of an hour, unable to think of anything to do. At last, when the nurse came and began dealing with this incredible turn of medical events, I went out to get a drink. All right, I had a few, then went home and slept like a dead man myself.\n \u0027I should never have left them, Edward. When I went back the next day, the apartment was empty. A few weeks later I received an e-mail from Joseph - or at least from Joseph\u0027s address - saying that after his miraculous recovery, Geshe wanted to travel to Tibet, the place of his heritage. I\u0027ve never heard from either of them since.\u0027\n The lightning, absent for almost a quarter of an hour, suddenly flared, turning the room into a flat tableau of black-and-white shapes. The thunder that followed seemed to rock the entire building. The light on Edward Arvedson\u0027s desk flickered once, then went out, as did the lights on his ventilator. Through the windows Nightingale could see the houses across the street had gone black as well. He jumped up, suddenly cold all over. His father\u0027s oldest friend and his own most trusted advisor was about to die of asphyxiation while he watched helplessly.\n \u0027Good God, Edward, the electricity . . .!\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t . . . worry . . .\u0027 Arvedson wheezed. \u0027I have a . . . standby . . . generator.\u0027\n A moment later Nightingale felt rather than heard something begin to rumble somewhere in the house below, and the desk light flickered back on, although the houses across the street remained dark. \u0027There,\u0027 said his godfather. \u0027You see, young Natan? Not such an old-fashioned fool after all, eh? I am prepared for things like this. Power for the street will be back on soon; it happens a lot in this ancient neighborhood. Now, tell me what you think is happening.\u0027\n Nightingale sat back, trying to regain his train of thought. If only the old man wasn\u0027t so stubborn about living on his own with only Jenkins - no spring lamb himself - for company.\n \u0027Right,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027Well, I\u0027m sure you\u0027re thinking the same thing as me, Uncle Edward. Somehow these predatory souls or spirits have found a way to possess the bodies of the dying. Which would be bad enough, but it\u0027s the incredible frequency with which it seems to be happening. I can\u0027t possibly investigate them all, of course, but if even half the reports that reach me are real, it\u0027s happening all over the world, several times a day.\u0027\n The rain was back now, lashing the windows and tattooing the roof of Edward\u0027s Victorian house. When the old man spoke, there was an unfamiliar tone in his voice. \u0027You are . . . frightened, my dear Natan.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Uncle Edward, I am. I\u0027ve never been this frightened, and I\u0027ve seen a lot. It\u0027s as if something fundamental has broken down, some wall between us and the other side, and now the living are under attack. What did the cab driver say to me on the way over, babbling about the weather - \"the storm door is open\" . . .? And I\u0027m afraid the storms are just going to keep coming thicker and faster until all our houses are blown down.\u0027\n \u0027But why? And why now?\u0027\n \u0027Why? Because they\u0027ve always been there - the hungry ones, the envious things that hate us because we can still breathe and sing and love. Do they want that back, or do they just want to keep us from having it? I don\u0027t know. And why now? I don\u0027t know that either. Perhaps some universal safeguard has stopped working, or these entities have learned something they didn\u0027t know before.\u0027\n \u0027Then here is the most important question, Nate. What are you going to do about it, now that you know? What can one person do?\u0027\n \u0027Well, make sure it isn\u0027t just one person trying to deal with it, to begin with. You and I know lots of people who don\u0027t think I\u0027m a charlatan - brave people who study this sort of thing, who fight the good fight and know the true danger. More than a few of us have dedicated our lives to keeping the rest of humanity safe, without reward or thanks. Now I have to alert them all, if they haven\u0027t discovered this already.\u0027 He stood and began to pace back and forth before the desk. \u0027And to make sure the word gets out, I\u0027ll use the very same tabloid vultures that you and I despise so much. They\u0027ll do good without knowing it. Because for every thousand people who\u0027ll read headlines that say things like \"So-Called Demon Hunter Claims Dead Are Invading the Living World\" and laugh at it as nonsense, one or two will understand . . . and will heed the warning.\u0027 He moved to the window, looked out into the darkness. \u0027We can only hope to hold these hungry ghosts at bay if every real paranormal researcher, exorcist, and sympathetic priest we can reach will join us - every collector you know, every student of the arcane, every adventurer behind the occult lines, all of those soldiers of the light that the rest of society dismiss as crazy. This will be our great war.\u0027\n Nightingale turned and walked back to his chair. \u0027So there you have it, Uncle Edward. I\u0027ll spread the word. You spread the word, too. Call in old favors. If enough of us hear the truth, we may still be able to get the storm door shut again.\u0027\n The old man was silent for a long time as thunder rolled away into the distance.\n \u0027You\u0027re a brave young man, Nate,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027Your parents would be proud of you. I\u0027m going to have to think for a while about the best way to help you, and though it embarrasses me to admit it, I also need some rest. You\u0027ll forgive me - I get tired so quickly. I\u0027ll be all right until Jenkins comes back in a few hours. You can let yourself out, can\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, Uncle Edward.\u0027 He went to the old man and gave him a quick hug, then kissed his cool, dry cheek. He carried his empty sherry glass to the sideboard. \u0027Now that I\u0027m back in town, I\u0027ll be by to see you again tomorrow. Good night.\u0027 On his way to the door, Nightingale stopped and held his fingers up to catch the light from the desk lamp and saw that the darkness on the tips of them was dust.\n \u0027Tell Jenkins he\u0027s getting sloppy,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t imagine you giving him a night off in the old days without finishing the cleaning. Looks like he hasn\u0027t dusted in weeks.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell him,\u0027 said his godfather. \u0027Go on, go on. I\u0027ll see you very soon.\u0027\n But Nightingale did not go through the doorway. Instead, he turned and slowly walked back into the room. \u0027Uncle Edward,\u0027 he said. \u0027Are you certain you\u0027re going to be all right? I mean, the power\u0027s still off. You can\u0027t breathe without your ventilator.\u0027\n \u0027The generator can run for hours and hours. It\u0027ll shut itself off when the regular power comes back.\u0027 He waved his hand testily. \u0027Go on, Nate. I\u0027m fine.\u0027\n \u0027But the strange thing,\u0027 said Nightingale, \u0027is that when the generator came on half an hour ago, the ventilator didn\u0027t. There must be something wrong with it.\u0027\n Arvedson went very still. \u0027What . . . what are you talking about?\u0027\n \u0027Here. Look, the little lights on it never came back on, either. Your ventilator\u0027s off.\u0027\n The room suddenly seemed very quiet, nothing but the distant sound of cars splashing along out on Jones Street, distant as the moon.\n \u0027What happened to Edward?\u0027\n The old man looked surprised. \u0027I don\u0027t . . . Nate, what are you saying . . .?\u0027\n The gun was out of Nightingale\u0027s coat and into his hand so quickly it might have simply appeared there. He leveled it at a spot between the old man\u0027s two bushy white eyebrows. \u0027I asked you what happened to Edward - the real Edward Arvedson. I\u0027m only going to ask this once more. I swear I\u0027ll kill him before I let you have his body, and I\u0027m betting you can\u0027t pull your little possession trick again on a full-grown, healthy man like me - especially not before I can pull the trigger.\u0027\n Even in the half- light of the desk lamp, the change was a fearful one: Edward Arvedson\u0027s wrinkled features did not alter in any great way, but something moved beneath the muscles and skin like a light-shunning creature burrowing through the dark earth. The eyes fixed on his. Although the face was still Edward\u0027s, somehow it no longer looked much like him. \u0027You\u0027re a clever boy, Nightingale,\u0027 said the stranger in his godfather\u0027s body. \u0027I should have noticed the ventilator never came back on, but as you\u0027ve guessed, this sack of meat no longer has a breathing problem. In fact, it no longer needs to breathe at all.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s happened to him?\u0027 The gun stayed trained on the spot between the old man\u0027s eyes. \u0027Talk fast.\u0027\n A slow, cold smile stretched the lips. \u0027That is not for me to say, but rather it is between him and his god. Perhaps he is strumming a harp with the other angels now . . . or writhing and shrieking in the deepest pits . . .\u0027\n \u0027Bastard!\u0027 Nightingale pulled back the trigger with his thumb. \u0027You lie! He\u0027s in there with you. And I know a dozen people who can make you jump right the hell back out.\u0027\n The thing shook its head. \u0027Oh, Mr Nightingale, you\u0027ve been playing the occult detective so long, you\u0027ve come to believe you\u0027re really in a story - and that it will have a happy ending. We didn\u0027t learn new ways to possess the living.\u0027 The smile returned, mocking and triumphant. \u0027We have learned how to move into the bodies of the recently dead. Quite a breakthrough. It\u0027s much, much easier than possession, and we cannot be evicted, because the prior tenant . . . is gone. Your Uncle Edward had a stroke, you see. We waited all around him as he died. Oh, and believe me, we told him over and over what we would do, including this moment. Like you, he caused us a great deal of trouble over the years - and as you know, we dead have long memories. And when he was beyond our torments at last, well, this body was ours. Already my essence has strengthened it. It does not need to breathe, and as you can see . . .\u0027 The thing rose from the wheelchair with imperial calm and stood without wavering. Nightingale backed off a few steps, keeping the gun high. \u0027. . . it no longer needs assistance to get around, either,\u0027 the thing finished. \u0027I feel certain I\u0027ll get years of use out of it before I have to seek another - time enough to contact and betray all of the rest of Edward Arvedson\u0027s old friends.\u0027\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 Nightingale fought against a despair that buffeted him like a cold wind. \u0027Oh, for the love of God, what do you monsters want?\u0027\n \u0027Who am I? Just one of the hungry ones. One of the unforgiving.\u0027 It sat down again, making the wheelchair creak. \u0027What do we want? Not to go quietly, as you would have us go - to disappear into the shadows of nonexistence and leave the rest of you to enjoy the light and warmth.\u0027 The thing lifted its knotted hands - Edward\u0027s hands, as they had seemed such a short time ago - in a greedy gesture of seizure. \u0027As you said, this is a war. We want what you have.\u0027 It laughed, and for the first time the voice sounded nothing at all like his godfather\u0027s familiar tones. \u0027And we are going take it from you. All of you.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. Because if you need bodies to survive here, then those bodies can be taken back from you.\u0027 And even as Nightingale spoke, his gun flashed and roared, and the thing in his godfather\u0027s shape staggered and fell back against the wheelchair cushions, chin on chest. A moment later the so- familiar face came up again. Smiling.\n \u0027Jenkins,\u0027 it said. \u0027If you would be so kind . . .\u0027 Something knocked the gun from Nightingale\u0027s hand, and then an arm like an iron bar slammed against his neck. He fought, but it was like being held by a full-grown gorilla. His struggles only allowed him to slide around enough in his captor\u0027s grip to see Jenkins\u0027s blank eyes and the huge hole in the side of the caretaker\u0027s head crusted with bits of bone and dried tissue.\n \u0027I lied about giving him the night off,\u0027 said the pseudo-Edward. \u0027The living get impatient, but my colleague who inhabits him now was perfectly willing to stand in the dark until I needed him.\u0027 Now Arvedson\u0027s body stood again, brushing at its clothes; the hole Nightingale\u0027s gunshot had made in its shirt was bloodless. \u0027Bullets are a poor weapon against the risen dead, Nightingale,\u0027 it pointed out with no little satisfaction. \u0027You could burn the body, I suppose, or literally pulverize it, and there would be nothing left for us to inhabit. But of course, you will not get the chance to tell anyone about that.\u0027\n \u0027Bastards!\u0027 He struggled helplessly against the Jenkins-thing\u0027s grip. \u0027Even if you kill me, there are hundreds more like me out there. They\u0027ll stop you!\u0027\n \u0027We will meet them all, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said his godfather\u0027s body. \u0027You will introduce us - or at least the new resident of your corpse will. And one by one, we will remove them. The dead will live, with all the power of age and riches and secrecy, and the rest of your kind will be our uncomprehending cattle, left alive only to breed more bodies for us. Your driver was right, Mr Nightingale: the storm door really is open now. And no power on this Earth can shut it.\u0027\n Nightingale tried to say something else then, shout some last words of defiance, but the pressure on his neck was crushingly strong, and the lights of the world - the lamp, the headlights passing in the street below, even the storm-shrouded stars beyond the window - had begun leaching away into utter darkness.\n His last sight was of the cold, hungry things that had been hiding behind that darkness, hiding and waiting and hating the living for so long, as they hurried toward him to feed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-new-dead-a-zombie-anthology/page-16.html","bookId":2463,"book":{"id":2463,"title":"The New Dead: A Zombie Anthology","description":"Storyline: \n Resurrection! \n The hungry dead have risen.
