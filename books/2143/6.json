Something must have come up,\" he surmised. \"Besides, I\u0027m sure he\u0027s just lonely. I\u0027ve never seen him at school, so he probably needs a friend,\" he said, stopping at the foot of the stairs.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter; you have a friend already.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not my boss.\"\\n\\n \"Running around with him can lead to all sorts of mess.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know? You don\u0027t even know him.\"\\n\\n \"I can just tell.\"\\n\\n \"Why, because he has tattoos and wears black? You\u0027re judging Valentine, just like everyone judges you. Just because he has black fingernails doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s a monster--that\u0027s how you\u0027ve defended yourself for years. And now look at you, behaving just like the town reacts to you.\"\\n\\n Billy Boy would\u0027ve had a point if Valentine wasn\u0027t a vampire. Even so, maybe my brother was right. Maybe Valentine was more like Alexander than Jagger. Maybe I was making assumptions that weren\u0027t fair.\\n\\n \"The day you start listening to others is the day I start listening to you,\" he said, and stormed up the stairs to his room.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" my mom asked as I entered the kitchen to find her wiping off the countertop. \"I heard you two shouting.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I replied, opening the refrigerator.\\n\\n \"One minute you\u0027re insisting we include your brother at dinner, the next you\u0027re yelling at each other.\"\\n\\n \"I thought that was normal,\" I said, grabbing a soda.\\n\\n \"I guess it is...,\" she admitted.\\n\\n I closed the refrigerator door. \"I have some news,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going to prom.\"\\n\\n My mother\u0027s face lit up as if I were a twenty-five-year-old woman announcing my engagement.\\n\\n \"Congratulations!\" she exclaimed, hugging me hard. \"We\u0027ll have to buy you a dress and shoes.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not necessary,\" I said, twisting off the plastic bottlecap. \"I\u0027ll find something at the thrift store.\"\\n\\n My mother wrinkled her nose. \"You\u0027ll be attending prom, not a nightclub. We\u0027ll get you something beautiful to wear that isn\u0027t torn, adorned with staples, or riddled with safety pins.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s exactly what I was afraid of. I\u0027d finally seen Valentine--even if it was only for a moment through a telescope. As I tried to finish my language arts essay, my mind was distracted by the eleven-year-old vampire. I imagined what he wanted at the treehouse--a hidden treasure, Jagger\u0027s leftover blood supply, a place to lay his coffin? I also envisioned all the places he could be speeding off to on his skateboard--Dullsville\u0027s cemetery, a hidden sewer, or an abandoned church. And most important, I wondered when I\u0027d see him again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-6.html","bookId":2143,"book":{"id":2143,"title":"Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4)","description":"Storyline: Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4) \\n There\u0027s a new vampire in town.
