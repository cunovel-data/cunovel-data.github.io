{"id":96003,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Like an uninspired artist\u0027s brushstroke across a landscape that screams of boredom and unoriginality, so is the typical American strip mall. Dullsville\u0027s was no exception, inhabited by an overpriced furniture showroom, a swank shoe outlet, a scrapbooking store, and the same women\u0027s clothing shops that populated every other strip mall. Scattered in the middle of the parking lot full of SUVs were several chain restaurants with insufferably long waiting lists, buzzing pagers, and portions the size of Montana.\n The Cricket Club, an English pub on steroids, specialized in food and beverages from across the pond. On the dark, overly shellacked wooden walls hung framed pictures of vintage cricket matches and other memorabilia, including authentic jerseys, scorecards, and trophies.\n Alexander and I entered the restaurant dressed as usual--or, in our case, unusual--me in my combat boots, pleated rayon skirt, and tri-layered Morbid Monkey tank tops, and Alexander in studded black cargo pants and a Mindfreak T-shirt. Naturally, we got stares from the preppy patrons, as if we had arrived at a cocktail party without an invitation.\n My dad was standing at the bar in a white oxford shirt and khakis, his tie loosened, with a soda in one hand. He closed out his tab and came over to us.\n \"Hello, Alexander,\" he said, shaking my boyfriend\u0027s hand as if they were football players at a coin toss.\n \"Hi, Mr. Madison,\" Alexander managed to say.\n \"Call me Paul,\" my dad said, patting him on the shoulder.\n \"Okay...Paul,\" Alexander mumbled awkwardly.\n \"Hi, sweetheart,\" my dad said, hugging me, then greeted my mom with a kiss on the cheek.\n \"Your table is ready, Mr. Madison,\" an \u0026#65533;ber-tan college-aged hostess said, holding menus in the shape of cricket bats. For a moment, I paused. I was proud to have my hippie-turned- conservative parents embrace Alexander\u0027s and my unconventional ways. Maybe this meant my mom was finally ready to buy me black fishnet stockings and torn mesh tops instead of J.Crew sweaters. My dad might invite Alexander and me to a Nightshade concert instead of a game of tennis. But they were a long way off from really accepting the situation. I was dying to tell them our secret-- that they were about to have dinner with a vampire!\n The conservative patrons with their perfect haircuts and impeccably groomed children gazed at us as if Alexander and I were Swamp Thing 1 and Swamp Thing 2. I could see the horror in their crystal blue eyes as they prayed that their coiffed kids wouldn\u0027t grow up and put purple streaks in their blond hair.\n I was hoping for a quiet booth in the corner, away from gossipmongers and gawkers--a place from which I could easily sneak out of the Cricket Club.\n Instead, the hostess showed us to a table in the center of the restaurant.\n We started to sit down, and my ultrapale boyfriend politely held out my chair for me. My dad quickly rose and followed Alexander\u0027s gentlemanly example for my surprised mother.\n \"The four of us should eat out more often,\" my mom said as we settled in. \"Alexander brings out the best in your father.\"\n Alexander and I were on display, as if we were in the spotlight on a Broadway stage. The soft candlelight couldn\u0027t mask the occasional lingering gaze or whispers from the other pubsters.\n However, I had other things on my mind. Aside from worrying about being an outcast, I had to figure out how Alexander and I were going to get to the library before Valentine did.\n Or maybe we were already too late. I imagined that, between the stacks of physics and calculus books, Valentine could be gnashing his fangs into my brother\u0027s neck. But I had to remain positive. It wasn\u0027t likely Valentine would risk being easily spotted. Or would he?\n \"This is quite a pleasure,\" my father said genuinely. \"Order anything you like. Your mother\u0027s paying,\" he teased.\n Just then a slight woman in a black DKNY pantsuit came over and stood beside our table. She had Trevor Mitchell\u0027s face. It was his mother.\n \"Hi, Sarah. Hi, Paul,\" Mrs. Mitchell said. Her smile stretched so wide that her pink lipstick started to crack.\n Mrs. Mitchell studied Alexander, then me, mentally taking notes of anything she could report to her tennis friends.\n \"This is a coincidence seeing you here,\" my mother said.\n \"Or fate,\" Mrs. Mitchell corrected as she gazed at my boyfriend.\n \"Oh...you know Alexander Sterling,\" my mom began.\n \"No, I\u0027ve seen him about town, but I haven\u0027t had the pleasure of meeting him face-to-face.\"\n Mrs. Mitchell extended her thin, flawless hand, complete with a French manicure and flaunting more dazzling jewelry than a saleswoman on QVC.\n Alexander quickly reached his own hand to hers. I felt like he was shaking the hand of the Wicked Witch of the West--without the green skin.\n \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever seen you out in daylight,\" she stated flatly.\n When Alexander and his family moved to Dullsville, Trevor had begun the rumor that the Sterlings were vampires, fueled by Mrs. Mitchell\u0027s remarks. I didn\u0027t want to give my nemesis\u0027s mother any more ammunition for her gossipmongering. Apparently, neither did my mother.\n \"Alexander\u0027s homeschooled,\" my mother announced.\n You go, Sarah Madison, I thought to myself.\n \"Trevor was seeing a girl from Romania,\" Mrs. Mitchell said, then turned to Alexander. \"I believe she was a friend of yours.\"\n Alexander shrugged his shoulders. \"We lived in the same town as the Maxwells, but we didn\u0027t see one another much.\"\n \"Interesting,\" Mrs. Mitchell retorted. \"Anyway, she seems to have suddenly disappeared.\"\n Then Mrs. Mitchell glared at me and raised one brown-pencil- drawn eyebrow, as if I\u0027d had something to do with Luna\u0027s departure-- which I did.\n \"Well, it was great seeing you,\" my dad interjected, forcing an end to the horribly awkward conversation.\n \"Of course. Mr. Mitchell will be arriving soon and I must get back to my table before they take it away. It was a delight to see you all,\" she said, and headed back to her booth.\n \"Thank you,\" I mouthed to my father.\n We all breathed a collective sigh of relief, for different reasons, as we placed our blue linen napkins on our laps.\n As we perused the menus, I racked my brain for a plan.\n Just then a bearded waiter came over, recited the specials with a fake English accent, and dashed off with our drink orders.\n \"Don\u0027t be shy, Alexander,\" my mother began. \"Order whatever you like. They\u0027re known for their fish and chips and bangers and mash.\" \"Alexander loves steak,\" I suggested.\n \"Then order the steak...This is great, isn\u0027t it? We really haven\u0027t had a chance to talk. Either you two are heading out for the night or we\u0027re surrounded by other parents at parties. It\u0027s great to have the chance for a private conversation.\"\n \"So what sports are you into?\" my dad asked. \"Football or basketball?\"\n I rolled my eyes. \"Alexander\u0027s an artist, Dad. He\u0027s not into sports.\"\n \"Oh...,\" my dad said, fidgeting in his seat, dumbfounded as to how he would communicate with another male now that the subject of athletics was off the table. \"Uh...that\u0027s okay,\" he stammered. \"Raven\u0027s mother used to draw sketches when we first dated.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know that,\" I said.\n \"What do you draw?\" Alexander asked eagerly.\n \"Oh, that was ages ago. I haven\u0027t touched a sketchbook in years. What is your medium?\" she asked.\n \"Oil paint.\"\n \"What is your specialty?\" my mom inquired.\n \"Portraits. Family. Memories,\" Alexander responded mysteriously.\n \"Vampires,\" I said proudly.\n My parents paused. \"I see you have a lot in common,\" my dad commented.\n \"Raven\u0027s exams are coming up,\" my mom began, fiddling with her silver bracelet. \"She said you were already taking your homeschool exams?\" \"Yes. I\u0027ve completed them.\"\n \"That\u0027s very impressive. Maybe some of your study habits will rub off on Raven,\" my dad added.\n \"Dad!\" I whined, sinking in my chair. \"Maybe we could finish with the interrogation after we order.\"\n \"You\u0027re right,\" my father agreed. \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\n The waiter returned with our drinks. \"Ladies,\" the waiter said, holding his paper and pen.\n \"I\u0027ll take the Cricket burger, well done,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027ll have the fish and chips,\" my mother said with a smile.\n \"For the young gentleman?\"\n Alexander cleared his throat. \"I\u0027ll have the rib-eye steak.\"\n \"How would you like that prepared?\"\n \"Raw,\" Alexander said matter-of-factly.\n My parents and the waiter looked at my boyfriend oddly.\n \"He means rare,\" I corrected. \"Medium rare.\"\n I could see Mrs. Mitchell\u0027s head lean ever so slightly out of her booth.\n \"Yes, that\u0027s what I meant,\" he said with a strained grin.\n \"And you, sir?\"\n \"I\u0027ll have the shepherd\u0027s pie,\" my dad ordered, \"and the green garlic and pea soup.\"\n The waiter took our menus and scampered off to the kitchen as Alexander glared at me. \"What did you order, Dad?\" I asked, horrified.\n \"Shepherd\u0027s pie.\"\n \"No--the soup.\"\n \"Green garlic. Why, would you like to order some? We can get the waiter.\"\n All at once, I imagined the plate of green garlic and pea soup being placed within smelling distance of my vampire boyfriend. Alexander would wheeze; then he\u0027d turn even more deathly pale than he already was. He\u0027d stand up, staggering and gasping for air. We were miles away from the Mansion, Jameson, and Alexander\u0027s life- saving antidote.\n \"No--Alexander is deathly allergic to garlic!\" I panicked. \"We have to stop them; they can\u0027t bring it out!\"\n My dad\u0027s easygoing disposition turned to concern. He tossed his napkin on the table. \"I\u0027ll cancel that immediately,\" he announced, and hurried off to find the waiter.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" my mother apologized. \"Can he eat nuts?\"\n \"Yes, it\u0027s just garlic he can\u0027t handle.\"\n My dad returned to our table. \"I changed it to a vegetable soup. You\u0027re not allergic to green beans, are you?\" my dad teased.\n We all laughed.\n \"That\u0027s an odd allergy,\" my dad said. \"How long have you had that?\"\n \"All my life. My whole family is allergic,\" Alexander said innocently. \"They\u0027ve always been.\"\n \"Ahem,\" I said, clearing my throat. I was getting overheated. My face was starting to flush and my heart was throbbing. First of all I was out on a double date with my parents; secondly my date was a vampire; and thirdly at any moment between the stacks of Abstract Algebra and Mathematics in Action, my brother might be meeting up with a tween bloodsucker.\n \"Excuse me,\" I said, shooting my chair back, \"I\u0027ll just be a moment.\"\n Alexander rose politely, like a southern gentleman, as I rushed off to the ladies\u0027 room.\n I was walking around the crowded bar when I bumped into someone.\n \"Excuse me,\" I apologized.\n \"Following me to restaurants now?\" a familiar voice said. I looked up. My heartbeat screeched to a halt. It was Trevor.\n \"I believe I was here first.\"\n \"Technically not. I believe my mother was. I\u0027m surprised to see you here. I thought you only ate in your dungeon,\" he said with a sneering grin.\n Ever since Alexander and I had diverted Jagger and Luna from turning Trevor into a late-night snack at the Graveyard Gala-- Trevor\u0027s party at Dullsville\u0027s cemetery-- I\u0027d gained a little respect from Trevor at school. Though my nemesis didn\u0027t know the Maxwells\u0027 true intent, he did know that for the last several days I had been warning him about the nefarious duo. Still, Trevor couldn\u0027t resist egging me on. His repartee was only slightly less biting than it used to be. Trevor and I\u0027d been caustic to each other since kindergarten--it was the only way we knew how to communicate. Without that, we\u0027d have no relationship. And that, I knew for sure, Trevor wasn\u0027t ready to give up.\n \"Is Alexander asking your father for your hand in marriage?\" \"Don\u0027t be lame--\"\n \"Not even to prom? It\u0027s next week. You\u0027ll miss watching me be crowned Prom King. Too bad they don\u0027t have a place for Prom Freak. They surely would have a tiara waiting for you.\"\n I snarled at my nemesis and glanced over at Alexander, who was politely engaged in conversation with my parents.\n Prom? I hadn\u0027t even thought about prom since Jagger, Luna, and now Valentine had arrived in town. Dullsville High was so small, all grades were invited to attend. Finally, I, Raven Madison, queen of the outcasts, had a potential date with the most gorgeous guy in all of Dullsville to the most important dance of the year, and I hadn\u0027t even had the time to daydream about it.\n My best friend, Becky, was so busy with her boyfriend, Matt, that she and I hadn\u0027t had a chance to dish about the prom. Of course, she\u0027d be attending the ball with Matt, and Trevor would arrive with some gorgeous blond varsity cheerleader. And I would be escorted by Alexander Sterling. But would he even go after the fiasco at the Snow Ball several months ago where Trevor challenged him, forcing him to retreat to the Mansion?\n And would there even be a prom if the town of Dullsville knew that a preteen vampire was lurking somewhere in town?\n \"Don\u0027t forget to vote for me,\" my nemesis said, disappearing into the crowd of patrons.\n I ducked into the ladies\u0027 room, washed my hands in the white porcelain sink, and reapplied bloodred eyeliner to the corners of my eyes and snow-colored powder to my nervous brow.\n How would I manage to get us to the library in the middle of dinner with my parents, while the curious Mitchells sat at an adjacent table, without making a scene?\n It would take a miracle--or at least a ghost white lie. \"I think Billy Boy should be with us,\" I said when I returned to our table.\n My parents looked at me skeptically.\n \"He\u0027s at a Math Club party. I told you that,\" my mom reminded me. \"They\u0027re providing dinner.\"\n \"You know how much he loves eating here. He\u0027s crazy about the Cricket burgers. Now I feel bad, eating at one of his favorite restaurants without him--\"\n \"We can bring something home for him,\" my dad offered. \"Why the sudden interest in your brother?\"\n Clearly my father wasn\u0027t making this easy.\n \"He loves the big-screen TVs. He whines enough as it is. I\u0027ll have to hear about it for weeks.\"\n \"You don\u0027t need your little brother as a buffer, do you?\" my mom asked. \"Paul, I think we\u0027re embarrassing her. We\u0027ll stop asking so many questions.\"\n \"No, you guys are great,\" I assured my parents. \"I just think he\u0027d be upset to know we were so close and didn\u0027t include him. How about Alexander and I just run over and pick him up?\" I suggested. \"It\u0027s only a few blocks away. We\u0027ll be back before our dinner arrives.\"\n \"He\u0027s having his own party,\" my dad said. \"Right now they are probably exchanging prime numbers.\"\n \"Well, if that\u0027s what you really want, Paul,\" Mom said.\n \"All right, I\u0027ll get him,\" my dad said resignedly, putting his napkin on the table.\n \"No--I want to,\" I said, standing up before my father could. \"Alexander\u0027s never been to the library.\" My dad looked at me suspiciously. \"Are you sure you\u0027re not sneaking off to a rave?\"\n \"In this town? No, but if I find out about one, you\u0027ll know where we are,\" I said with a wink. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-2.html","bookId":2143,"book":{"id":2143,"title":"Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4) \n There\u0027s a new vampire in town.
