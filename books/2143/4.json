{"id":96005,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Dullsville\u0027s library was a freestanding two-story brick building with white colonial columns, built in the late nineteenth century.\\n\\n My favorite memories of visiting the library were during Halloween. The librarians did their best to make it scary and fun. They\u0027d decorate the shelves with cobwebs, dangle plastic spiders from computers, and place \"terrorific\" authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King, and Mary Shelley on display. I\u0027d be greeted at the door by a witch and later check out a book from a werewolf.\\n\\n However, today wasn\u0027t Halloween and I was going to be checking out more than literature. Alexander and I breezed through the automatic doors and past the \"Used Books\" drop box, the table of upcoming events, a cart of returned books, and the circular information desk.\\n\\n We cased every aisle to see if Valentine might be hiding behind one. The library was empty of its regular and visiting readers, but a few Math Club family members were biding their time surfing the Internet. Alexander and I searched the fiction aisles and then wandered through the DVD and CD section. A few siblings were hanging out in the teen section. Valentine wasn\u0027t around, and neither was Billy Boy.\\n\\n A young woman with a checkered sweater and jeans was restocking books. \"May I help you?\" she inquired.\\n\\n \"Can you tell me where the Math Club is having their party?\" I asked.\\n\\n She pointed to the stairwell and adjacent elevator. \"Lower level, behind children\u0027s literature, in the conference room.\"\\n\\n As Alexander and I descended the aging staircase, I could smell the strange scent of old books combined with the intoxicating scent of cheese pizza. When we reached the bottom, we saw a fountain with rocks running along the back wall. It held some hefty goldfish, and gold and silver coins lay at the bottom like sunken treasures. A woman was sitting with her child as the little girl innocently tried to pet the yellow swimmers.\\n\\n \"My mom brought me here when I was little. She used to give me a penny to throw into the fountain,\" I shared with Alexander as we walked past a round child-sized table riddled with picture books. \"My wish was always the same. That I\u0027d become a vampire.\" I gazed into his eyes. \"Maybe that wish can finally come true.\"\\n\\n Instead of answering, Alexander led me toward the conference room.\\n\\n We walked by shelves of picture books, tables of computers, and posters of the Cat in the Hat, Curious George, and Babar. The normally quiet library was filled with the sounds of kids talking and laughing.\\n\\n We finally reached the doors of the conference room. A long rectangular table was covered with pizza, popcorn, chips, and all the soda a preteen\u0027s bladder could hold.\\n\\n A middle-aged man, who looked more like a football coach than a librarian in his sweatshirt and jeans, was at the head of the room, pulling a movie screen down over the blackboard.\\n\\n About twenty kids in all were having a blast, hanging out on the weathered brown carpeting, lounging in beanbag and folding chairs, playing with MP3 players or Gameboys, and munching on snacks.\\n\\n Stationed at the doorway, I quickly scanned the room, searching for any white-haired preteen. I breathed a sigh of relief when I didn\u0027t see Valentine. But I did see something I never thought I\u0027d witness-- my pesky sibling entertaining a small group of students who had gathered on the floor around him, cracking up like he was a nerdy Chris Rock. I was stunned. I\u0027d always called Billy \"Nerd Boy\" for a reason, but now he was shining in a way I\u0027d never seen before. I realized the scrawny little brother that I\u0027d always picked on my whole life had something I didn\u0027t have--a club of peers that he related to and who looked up to him as if he were a king.\\n\\n I hated to admit it, but I felt a tinge of pride and a tiny bit of jealousy. My puny little brother was lucky to have a group to belong to--something I had never had. There was Chess Club, French Club, but never the Goth Club. I imagined a preteen roomful of students like Alexander and myself, eating gummy worms, reading Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula, and watching Queen of the Damned.\\n\\n Suddenly the laughter stopped, and the students glared at us, like we were the nerdy ones.\\n\\n Billy Boy turned around. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked, joining Alexander and me by the door. \"Is something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Have you seen that pasty kid with black fingernails that you promised to show Henry\u0027s treehouse to?\"\\n\\n \"No. I told him we had Math Club tonight, so we agreed to meet at Henry\u0027s tomorrow at sunset. He eats dinner late,\" Billy Boy explained. \"I thought maybe he might meet us here, but I haven\u0027t seen him. Why?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind...Mom and Dad are waiting for us at the Cricket Club. We want you to come over.\"\\n\\n \"The Cricket Club,\" he said enthusiastically. \"But I\u0027ve already eaten.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter; you can get dessert.\"\\n\\n \"But Star Wars is about to start. And I promised I\u0027d go home with Henry.\"\\n\\n Billy Boy was at the age where he preferred the company of his friends to his family. I nearly felt torn insisting my brother join us when he was having such a great time at the party, but I didn\u0027t have a choice. Valentine might be lurking in the Dead Tree Forest--or anywhere in Dullsville, for that matter.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll bring Henry with us,\" I said sternly.\\n\\n The preteen techno wizard then sauntered over. \"Hi, guys. Have you come to watch the movie?\"\\n\\n \"No, we\u0027ve come to take you and my brother to dinner. We have to hurry; Mom and Dad are waiting.\"\\n\\n The librarian came over. His generous smile couldn\u0027t mask his concern that my brother was talking to a dark stranger.\\n\\n \"This is my sister--and her boyfriend.\" Billy Boy introduced us with a hint of pride.\\n\\n \"We are just about to start the movie,\" the book man began. \"You are welcome to stay.\"\\n\\n \"Henry and I will have to take a rain check,\" Billy Boy replied. \"We have a match at the Cricket Club.\"\\n\\n Back at the restaurant, Alexander placed his hand on my knee in between bites of his \"bloody\" steak. The Mitchells continued to eyeball us as Billy Boy and Henry took over the conversation, talking about computer math and the strange boy they met a few days ago at the library.\\n\\n \"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t invite a boy over you don\u0027t know,\" my mother said, sounding worried.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I said.\"\\n\\n \"Did he transfer to your school?\" she questioned. \"No, I think he\u0027s visiting,\" Billy Boy replied.\\n\\n \"Who?\" my mom asked. \"Do you know his family?\"\\n\\n Billy Boy turned to Henry, who just shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure I like you hanging around a boy who nobody knows anything about.\"\\n\\n The truth was, Alexander and I did know--we just couldn\u0027t tell.\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ll find out all about him when we meet him tomorrow,\" Billy Boy concluded.\\n\\n My dad quickly changed the conversation to Billy Boy\u0027s upcoming English project.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Facts Versus Folklore. We got to choose from a bunch of myths and legends--mermaids, werewolves, trolls. Henry and I picked vampires. I figured if we bring in Raven we\u0027ll get an easy A,\" my brother said with a laugh.\\n\\n \"Billy--be kind,\" my mother scolded.\\n\\n Little did they know who the real vampire at the table was.\\n\\n In spite of my family\u0027s intense inquiries, I could see Alexander was having fun. I felt a twinge of melancholy for my beloved, who\u0027d been forced to leave Romania and his family. I wondered if I would have been able to leave my whole family and Becky behind, move to another country, and live in a lonely old Mansion with just a butler for company. Even though the creepy man himself, Jameson, was a dear and trusted friend to Alexander and the Sterling family, he was centuries older. I\u0027m sure the odd couple didn\u0027t talk about music, girls, and movies.\\n\\n Alexander never once complained. However, I was relieved that I\u0027d snuck into the Mansion and found my Goth mate there. By the way my boyfriend was beaming here at the Cricket Club, I\u0027m sure he felt the same way. Now that we all were together, I knew my family and I were safe. I just didn\u0027t know for how long.\\n\\n After dropping Henry off, we all arrived home, our bellies filled with vinegar and chips and chocolate ice cream.\\n\\n \"I appreciate your inviting me out to dinner,\" Alexander said to my parents.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to do it again,\" my dad said, shaking Alexander\u0027s hand.\\n\\n I walked my boyfriend to Jameson\u0027s car.\\n\\n \"Tomorrow we\u0027ll have to be at the treehouse at sunset,\" he said to me as he leaned against the Mercedes.\\n\\n Alexander touched my cheek with the back of his pale hand, then cupped my chin. He leaned in to give me a lingering good-night kiss.\\n\\n I watched him as he drove down the street, off to his attic room. He would make the night pass with music and art until it was time to return to his coffin.\\n\\n I opened my own bedroom door to find my kitten, Nightmare, on my bookshelf, hissing. I was holding her in my arms, softly stroking her nose, when I heard a scream. It came from Billy Boy\u0027s room.\\n\\n I had just released Nightmare onto my bed and raced into the hallway when Billy Boy flew out of his room, crashing into me.\\n\\n He almost knocked the wind out of me. \"Get off, you doofus!\" I yelled. \"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Billy Boy didn\u0027t speak; instead he pointed into his room. His door remained partially closed. It creaked as I slowly pushed it open.\\n\\n The way he had screamed, I expected to see a dead body.\\n\\n Nothing looked out of place--his dresser, closet, and bed were all in order.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with you? You were screaming like a girl!\"\\n\\n He shook his head and kept pointing in the direction of his computer desk. \"Over there.\"\\n\\n I crept over and glanced around. \"Yes, this would frighten me, too,\" I said, holding up a pre-algebra book. \"You are only in the fifth grade.\"\\n\\n \"No, outside--\"\\n\\n I peered out into the backyard. I could see our swing set and my dad retrieving a garden hose. I stepped back. Then out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move. Hanging upside down from the window casing was a very live bat. Two beady green eyes pierced through me. I couldn\u0027t move.\\n\\n Just then my mom appeared. \"I was in the basement and I heard someone shouting.\"\\n\\n I turned to see Billy Boy poking his head out from behind my mother.\\n\\n I looked back toward the window. The bat was gone.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" my mom wondered aloud.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I said. \"I think Billy Boy is afraid of his shadow.\"\\n\\n \"It was a bat!\" he protested. \"It had green eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Bats don\u0027t have green eyes,\" my mother argued. \"This one did and it was staring right at me!\" my brother urged.\\n\\n \"It must be all that Mountain Dew you drank,\" I began, \"combined with that Cricket Club hot fudge sundae. It all rushed to your head.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s calm down,\" my mother ordered. \"You both need some rest before school.\"\\n\\n My mother went over to the window and peered out. She shrugged her shoulders and pulled his curtains closed. Then she switched off his computer desk lamp. \"All the shadows are gone.\"\\n\\n Billy Boy cornered me at the door as my mom went back downstairs. \"I know you saw it,\" he said. \"Just \u0027cause you didn\u0027t tell her doesn\u0027t mean you can catch it. It\u0027s not going to be your new pet.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I couldn\u0027t afford to feed it,\" I said truthfully, and pushed my way past him.\\n\\n That night I was more restless than usual. Not only had dozing off in Alexander\u0027s coffin disrupted my sleep pattern, but I was exhilarated. I, Raven Madison, had spent the daylight snuggling in a coffin with my vampire boyfriend. I wanted to scream it from the top of my lungs! I went to the window and peered out into the darkness. I didn\u0027t want to be alone.\\n\\n I\u0027d give anything to spend an eternity with Alexander in his attic room, in our cozy coffin. But there would be a price. I would have to say good-bye to all that I knew and loved--my parents, my best friend, Becky, even Billy Boy.\\n\\n And then I would be trading mortal nemeses for nocturnal ones. I wondered if being a vampiress would bring me any closer to the Maxwells. In the underworld, except for Alexander, I might find myself even lonelier than in Dullsville. I lay in bed, Nightmare cuddling at my feet while I doodled sketches of Valentine in my Olivia Outcast journal. He was a cartoonish-looking kid with spiky white hair, tattoos, and piercings.\\n\\n Above him, I drew a bat with green eyes. I thought about where an eleven-year-old vampire could be sleeping his daylight hours away--Dullsville\u0027s cemetery? The attic of an old church? Or maybe he was hiding in piles of leaves in the Oakley Woods. And I wondered what he might be doing alone in Dullsville at night-- spying on tween mortals, searching for vacant treehouses, or marking his future unsuspecting Dullsvillian prey? But then I began to think about how Valentine must be lonely without his family, isolated from his friends or guardians. Did he run away from home? Why wasn\u0027t Valentine with Jagger and Luna?\\n\\n Then I drew Jagger--his blue and green hypnotic eyes, his skull tattoo, his white hair with bloodred-tipped ends. Above him, I sketched a bat with piercing blue and green eyes. I wondered what Jagger really wanted in life. Was he back home in Romania biting the necks of teenagers out for a night of clubbing? Did he really crave to be a soccer star, as Luna had revealed to me, the same way he craved blood?\\n\\n I drew an image of Luna. A gothic fairy princess with long white hair and baby-doll blue eyes, decked out in a tight black dress with pink rubber bracelets, a choker, and pink combat boots. Above her I drew a bat with ocean blue eyes. A kindred spirit of sorts. I imagined her back in Romania, thrashing it up at an underground club, the flashing lights twinkling against her like tiny ghosts as she danced the night away, oblivious to the handsome clubsters surrounding her, and waiting for the perfect moment to stop and pick the neck she wanted to taste.\\n\\n Not only was she bonded to her brother Jagger, but someday she\u0027d be bonded to another vampire for all of eternity.\\n\\n Luna had actually accepted me as a vampiress. She complimented me on my style instead of being repulsed by it. But our relationship was really built on lies. I had convinced her I was from the Underworld, and she had fooled me into thinking she desired Trevor when in fact it was Alexander she wanted all along.\\n\\n I guess in our deceit we deserved each other.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure Alexander could paint the teen and tween vampires as precisely as a photograph, but I managed to capture their essence. The images stared back at me as if they were real. I closed my journal on the rendered Maxwells and looked forward to tomorrow, when Alexander and I might finally put an end to their invasion of Dullsville. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-4.html","bookId":2143,"book":{"id":2143,"title":"Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4)","description":"Storyline: Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4) \\n There\u0027s a new vampire in town.
