{"id":96019,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Henry and Billy Boy were playing chess on Henry\u0027s cell phone and I was leafing through Historical Romania when a haggard Alexander finally appeared in the drawing room, minus his prom suit jacket.\n I raced over to my worn-out boyfriend.\n \"How is Valentine?\" I asked.\n \"He\u0027s resting,\" he assured me, placing his hand on my shoulder.\n \"And you?\"\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" he said, relieved.\n \"Is he all right?\" Billy Boy inquired.\n \"Yes,\" Alexander replied. \"We reached him in time.\"\n \"What was wrong with him?\" Henry asked.\n \"He was dehydrated. Jameson whipped up some smoothies and now he\u0027s rejuvenated.\"\n The boys eagerly eyed each other.\n \"Can we see him?\" Billy Boy asked.\n Henry held the mirror in his hand. \"Yes. We\u0027d like to take a look at him.\" I gave Alexander a knowing glance. \"The boys think Valentine is a vampire.\"\n Henry and Billy Boy appeared embarrassed.\n \"Maybe you guys are getting dehydrated too,\" Alexander mused.\n \"We shouldn\u0027t disturb him,\" my boyfriend continued. \"But he wanted me to tell you both he said thank you.\"\n \"We\u0027d really like to see him,\" Henry insisted.\n \"It\u0027s getting late,\" I stated. \"Billy was already grounded once this week.\"\n \"Jameson will take you all home,\" Alexander said.\n \"Cool!\" my brother said, and high-fived his friend.\n I paused. Prom night was over? While the rest of Dullsville High partied into the wee hours, I was being sent home. I understood the nerd-mates needed to be tucked into bed, but me?\n \"All of us?\" I tried to clarify.\n While Billy Boy and Henry collected their things, Alexander pulled me to the side. He leaned against the grandfather clock.\n \"I\u0027m sorry your prom night had to end this way.\"\n \"The night has just begun,\" I said.\n \"You are right. My night has just begun. Valentine can no longer search for Jagger and Luna on his own. I must find them for him. I\u0027ve spent the last six months evading the Maxwells. It\u0027s ironic; now I\u0027ll be the one who\u0027s seeking them out.\"\n \"I think I know where Jagger and Luna are,\" I said proudly.\n \"You do?\" he asked. \"Hipsterville.\"\n \"How do you know that?\"\n \"That is where his aunt, Maria Maxwell, is buried. Henry and I searched on the Internet.\"\n \"But how do you know Jagger is there?\"\n \"I checked. He was just hanging out at the Coffin Club.\"\n \"Then they are closer than I thought,\" he said, relieved. \"That\u0027s great news.\"\n As we reached the doorway, and the nerd-mates hopped down the front steps and out to Jameson\u0027s waiting car, I gazed up at the moon as it slowly became blanketed by a hazy cloud.\n It hit me what Alexander had just revealed to me. He\u0027d have to take Valentine to Hipsterville--now.\n I knew I had a grave situation on my hands.\n \"When I come back tomorrow at sunset, you won\u0027t be here, will you?\"\n Alexander said nothing.\n I turned and saw Billy Boy and Henry getting into Jameson\u0027s car.\n My heart felt like a silver bullet had just penetrated it.\n \"You\u0027ll be leaving tonight...when Jameson returns.\"\n Alexander didn\u0027t answer. Instead, he placed his hand on my shoulder.\n \"That\u0027s not fair. I don\u0027t want you to leave the Mansion again. Ever...,\" I continued. A tear welled up in my eye.\n \"How long will you be?\" I asked.\n \"As long as it takes,\" he said, trying to comfort me, but his own dark eyes were sad.\n \"I can\u0027t be without you, not for a second, much less a sunset,\" I said, my heart breaking.\n \"Neither can I, but I have no choice. Valentine cannot stay here any longer, for his own safety, mine, and all of Dullsville\u0027s.\"\n I knew what Alexander was doing had to be done. However, that didn\u0027t mean that I had to like it.\n \"Take me with you to Hipsterville. Then we won\u0027t be apart for a moment.\"\n \"You have school--\"\n \"It\u0027s the weekend, and we have teachers\u0027 prep day next week. I can stay with my aunt Libby. I\u0027m sure Jameson can convince my parents. He\u0027s very charming.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be going places that you shouldn\u0027t know about. Places that aren\u0027t safe for a mortal like you. It\u0027s best for both of us that I\u0027m the one who leaves.\"\n Leaves? I was crushed.\n Then Valentine\u0027s own words earlier tonight in the cave about Alexander\u0027s innermost thoughts came back to me. Maybe by leaving, Alexander felt he was protecting me, too.\n \"This isn\u0027t about Valentine, is it?\" I asked, my words breaking in my throat. \"It\u0027s about what Valentine found out when he read your thoughts.\"\n Alexander turned toward the moon. My eyes filled with tears. I grasped his arm. \"I\u0027m happy to know that you thirst for me the same way I thirst for you. I want us to be together--in your world.\"\n \"I know, but--\"\n I put my finger on his lips.\n \"That\u0027s always been my dream. Since I was a little girl. My middle name is \u0027Vampire.\u0027\"\n Alexander took my hand in his. \"I never meant to put you in any danger--and that\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever done since I met you. Valentine is right. I am a threat to you--on many levels.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never felt threatened by you--only loved. You are no more a threat than Trevor.\"\n \"Trevor can\u0027t take you into the Underworld. And now that you know that I\u0027ve struggled with...that I\u0027ve even considered taking you there...,\" Alexander said in a serious voice. \"Now that I\u0027ll be leaving for Hipsterville, I can at least be assured that you will be safe--from the Maxwells and from me.\"\n Alexander\u0027s sullen eyes turned even darker.\n \"You are going to take Valentine to Hipsterville and then never return,\" I said.\n Alexander didn\u0027t reply.\n \"Then Valentine and Jagger have gotten their revenge! They\u0027ve turned nothing more than rambling thoughts against us. They\u0027ve gotten exactly what they wanted. They\u0027ve destroyed you--and me!\"\n Tears streamed down my face.\n I stood on the stairs, preparing to hear the door slam behind me.\n Instead I heard nothing. But I felt the same familiar presence I\u0027d felt behind me when I\u0027d snuck into the Mansion. I felt a warm, gentle hand on my shoulder. I turned around and saw Alexander still standing there, a tear in his eye. My gothic guy, my vampire-mate. He stood before me like a knight of the night.\n He took my hand in his and held it to his lips.\n \"Raven, you understand that I cannot survive without the darkness, blood, and my coffin.\"\n \"I know...,\" I said, choking up.\n \"Since I\u0027ve moved into the Mansion, I learned something.\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"I cannot survive without you.\"\n I smiled through my own raining tears. I fell into his arms and wrapped my arms around his waist.\n Alexander caressed my hair. I gazed up into his dark, mysterious eyes. He kissed me.\n \"Jameson is waiting,\" he said softly. \"I\u0027ll be back before you even miss me.\"\n \"I miss you already.\"\n It took all my strength to tear myself away from Alexander.\n Tears dripped down my face as I ran toward the car, already feeling his absence. Alexander could be away for days, weeks, even months.\n \"Why are you crying?\" Billy Boy asked when I hopped into the Mercedes. \"You\u0027ll see him tomorrow.\"\n I pressed my hand to the window. I could see Alexander standing on the Mansion steps, his hand also raised toward mine, his shadowy image getting smaller and smaller as Jameson drove us farther away from the Mansion. The car pulled around the gate. I turned around. The Mansion door was closed.\n Alexander was gone. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-18.html","bookId":2143,"book":{"id":2143,"title":"Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Dance with a Vampire (Vampire Kisses #4) \n There\u0027s a new vampire in town.
