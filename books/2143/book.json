His name is Valentine Maxwell. Goth-girl Raven knows this latest intruder can only mean trouble--he\u0027s the younger sibling of two vampires she fought to drive out of Dullsville.

Though torn by the excitement of every teen girl\u0027s fantasy--attending the prom with her boyfriend--Raven must do everything she can to protect Billy. \n Valentine\u0027s appearance may pose even further threats. Could he somehow know Raven\u0027s innermost feelings about becoming immortal for her true love, Alexander? The far-from-ordinary romance of these two teen outsiders takes another surprise-filled spin in the fourth book of Ellen Schreiber\u0027s applauded Vampire Kisses series.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4.jpg","author":"Ellen Schreiber","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":18,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
