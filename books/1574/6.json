{"id":110274,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The medusa made an unhappy whistling sound. \"No, beastie. Don\u0027t fret!\" she called softly. \"They\u0027re here to help!\" At least, Deryn assumed they were. But she hadn\u0027t been expecting anything quite so big to come hunting her down. The airship drew closer, until Deryn could make out the gondola suspended from the beastie\u0027s belly. The foot-tall letters under the bridge windows came slowly into focus... . Leviathan. She swallowed. \"And barking famous, these friends are.\" The Leviathan had been the first of the great hydrogen breathers fabricated to rival the kaiser\u0027s zeppelins. A few beasties had grown larger since, but no other had yet made the trip to India and back, breaking German airship records all the way. \"THE LEVIATHAN APPROACHES.\" The Leviathan\u0027s body was made from the life threads of a whale, but a hundred other species were tangled into its design, countless creatures fitting together like the gears of a stopwatch. Flocks of fabricated birds swarmed around it - scouts, fighters, and predators to gather food. Deryn saw message lizards and other beasties scampering across its skin. According to her aerology manual, the big hydrogen breathers were modeled on the tiny South American islands where Darwin had made his famous discoveries. The Leviathan wasn\u0027t one beastie, but a vast web of life in ever shifting balance. The motivator engines changed pitch, nudging the creature\u0027s nose up. The airbeast obeyed, cilia along its flanks undulating like a sea of grass in the wind - a host of tiny oars rowing backward, slowing the Leviathan almost to a halt. The huge shape drifted slowly overhead, blotting out the sky. Its belly was all mottled grays, camouflage for night raids. In the sudden coolness of the huge shadow, Deryn stared up, spellbound. This vast, fantastic creature had actually come to rescue her. The Huxley shuddered again, wondering where the sun had gone. \"Hush, beastie. It\u0027s nothing but your big cousin.\" Deryn heard calls from above, and she saw movement. A rope tumbled into view, unrolling past her. Another followed, then a dozen more, until Deryn was surrounded by an upside-down forest of swaying ropes. She stretched out for one, but the width of the air-beast\u0027s gasbag kept the rope out of reach. Deryn swung the pilot\u0027s rig, trying to get closer. Her motion made the Huxley\u0027s tentacles curl up tight, resulting in a sickening lurch downward. \"Aye, so now you want to head down?\" she complained. \"Just useless, you are.\" The airship\u0027s engines changed pitch again, and the dangling lines reappeared, still out of reach. But then the engines overhead set up a grinding pattern, on-off, on-off ... and the ropes began to sway in rhythm with the sound. That was one clever pilot up there. The ropes swung closer with every pulse of the engines. Deryn stretched out one arm as far as she could... . Finally her reaching fingers caught hold. She pulled the rope in, knotting it to the ring over her rig - then frowned. Were they going to hoist her up into the gondola? Wouldn\u0027t that flip the Huxley upside down? But the line stayed slack, and a few moments later a message lizard made its way down. Its tiny webbed hands cupped the rope as though it were a thin tree branch. The lizard\u0027s bright green skin seemed to glow in the shadows below the airship. It spoke with a posh accent, the deep voice uncanny from such a wee body. \"Mr. Sharp, I presume?\" The lizard let out a throaty chuckle. Gobsmacked as she was, Deryn almost answered. Of course, the message lizard was only repeating what one of the officers overhead had said to it. \"Greetings from the Leviathan,\" it continued. \"Our apologies for the delay. Bad weather and all that.\" It made a noise like a man clearing his throat, and Deryn half expected the lizard to raise a tiny fist to its mouth. \"But here we are at last. We\u0027ll be taking you in on the dorsal side, of course - standard procedure.\" The lizard paused, and Deryn pondered what \"dorsal\" might mean. \"Ah, yes. I\u0027m told you\u0027re just a sprog. Well done, getting lost on your first flight.\" Deryn rolled her eyes. First a bag of gas and insect guts had carted her halfway across England, and now she was getting cheek from a barking lizard! \"I expect you don\u0027t know standard procedure. Well, it\u0027s quite simple, really. We\u0027ll drop below you, then come up under and bring you in with the dorsal winch. Any questions?\" The message lizard stared up at her expectantly, blinking its wee black eyes. \"No questions, sir. I\u0027m ready,\" Deryn said, remembering to use her boy\u0027s voice. She wasn\u0027t about to admit she didn\u0027t know what \"dorsal\" meant. The message lizard didn\u0027t move, just blinked again. \"So ... standard procedure it is?\" she added. The lizard waited another moment, but when Deryn said nothing more, it scampered back up the rope to repeat her words to whoever was at the other end. A minute later the other ropes were all hoisted away, but the line attached to her pilot\u0027s rig was given more slack. It looped down almost out of sight, a quarter mile of rope, it looked like. Then the airship\u0027s idling engines sprang to life again. The huge shadow pulled back against the wind, so that the sun broke out from behind its nose, half blinding Deryn. The airship dropped then, venting hydrogen with a sound like rushing water, steadily descending till the officers in the bridge windows were dead even with her, only twenty yards away. One smiled and gave a crisp salute, and Deryn returned it. The Leviathan dropped still farther, and the Huxley whined a bit when one huge eye drew level with them. \"Don\u0027t you give me any more bother,\" Deryn murmured. She was watching keenly, noting how the airship\u0027s huge harness wrapped around its body, holding the gondolas in place. The straps were connected by a network of ropes, like the rigging of a sailing ship. Strange six-legged beasties climbed alongside the crewmen in the ropes, snuffling the airbeast\u0027s skin. Those had to be the hydrogen sniffers she\u0027d read about, searching the membrane for leaks. When the Leviathan\u0027s vast silver expanse slipped beneath her, Deryn saw that the other end of her rope was now attached to a winch on the creature\u0027s spine. So \"dorsal\" was just Service-speak for \"backside.\" The winch was small and aluminum, made as light as possible, like everything on an airship. Two men cranked it, drawing up the slack quickly enough. Soon Deryn and her nervous Huxley were descending toward the Leviathan\u0027s silver back. A few minutes later a half dozen crewmen grabbed the tentacles of the medusa and hauled it down. Deryn found herself released from the pilot\u0027s rig, stumbling with numbed legs onto the squishy surface of the Leviathan\u0027s inflated skin. \"Welcome aboard, Mr. Sharp,\" said the young officer in charge. Deryn tried to stand up straight, but pain shot down her spine. She wriggled her toes inside Jaspert\u0027s boots, trying to erase the pins and needles in her feet. \"Thank you, sir,\" she managed. \"You all right there?\" the officer asked. \"Aye, sir. Just a bit numb in my, um, dorsal areas.\" The officer laughed. \"Long flight, eh?\" \"Aye, sir. A bit.\" She sheepishly returned his salute. He was smiling, at least. All the crewmen looked rather jolly as they checked over the medusa. Deryn supposed it wasn\u0027t often they were called upon to rescue recruits from the sky. A man in a coxswain\u0027s uniform clapped her on the back. \"Your Huxley\u0027s in good shape after a storm like that. You must have a way with the beasties, Mr. Sharp.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" she said. The men at the winch were running the Huxley back up, towing it in the Leviathan\u0027s wake. \"Not many middies spend half their first day aloft,\" the officer said. \"I\u0027m not a middy exactly, sir. Haven\u0027t taken the tests yet.\" Deryn glanced longingly around the topside, praying they would let her explore the ship while they took her back to the Scrubs. She\u0027d be ready to walk again in just a few more minutes... . The coxswain laughed. \"Solving a few aeronautics problems shouldn\u0027t be too hard after free-ballooning in a Huxley. And with this trouble brewing, I expect the Service will be looking for a few more lads.\" Deryn frowned. \"Trouble, sir?\" The officer nodded. \"Ah, yes. I suppose you haven\u0027t heard. Some Austrian duke and duchess got themselves killed last night. There may be a bit of a ruckus on the Continent.\" She blinked. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir. I don\u0027t understand.\" The officer shrugged. \"Not sure what it\u0027s got to do with Britain myself, but we\u0027ve been put on alert. Now that we\u0027ve got you sorted, we\u0027re headed straight over to France, in case the Clankers try to start something.\" He smiled. \"I expect you\u0027ll be with us a few days. Hope that isn\u0027t a bother.\" Deryn\u0027s eyes widened. As sensation returned to her legs, she could feel the rumble of the engines in the air-beast\u0027s skin. From the spine of the Leviathan, its silver flanks sloping away into oblivion, the sky was huge in all directions. A few days, the man had said - a hundred more hours in this perfect sky. Deryn saluted again, trying to hide her grin. \"No, sir. No bother at all.\" NINE Alek awoke to the chatter of Morse code. Wood creaked as he stirred, and a damp smell filled his nose. Dust swirled in shafts of sunlight streaming through the half-rotten walls. He sat up and blinked, staring at the hay covering his clothes. Prince Aleksandar had never slept in a barn before. Of course, he\u0027d done a lot of new things in the last two weeks. Klopp, Bauer, and Master Engineer Hoffman were snoring nearby. The Stormwalker crouched in the halflit barn, its head almost level with the hayloft. Alek had maneuvered the machine inside late last night, shuffling at half height in the darkness to squeeze it in. A tricky bit of piloting. Morse code crackled again through the walker\u0027s open viewport. Count Volger, of course. The man was allergic to sleep. The gap between the hayloft and the walker\u0027s head was barely the length of a sword, an easy jump. Alek landed softly, his bare feet silent on the metal armor. He eased himself over the edge to peek in through the viewport. Volger sat facing away in the commander\u0027s chair, a wireless earphone pressed against his head. Slowly, silently, Alek lowered one foot to the edge of the viewport... . \"Careful not to fall, Your Highness.\" Alek sighed, wondering if he would ever manage to sneak up on his fencing master. He slid through the viewport and dropped into the pilot\u0027s chair. \"Don\u0027t you ever sleep, Count?\" \"Not with that racket.\" Volger glared out at the hayloft. \"You mean the snoring?\" Alek frowned. He\u0027d grown used to sleeping through the noises of men and machines, but somehow the tiny crackle of dots and dashes from the wireless had woken him. Two weeks of being hunted had altered his senses. \"Anything about us?\" Volger shrugged. \"The codes have changed again. But there\u0027s more chatter than I\u0027ve ever heard before; the army is preparing for war.\" \"Maybe they\u0027ve forgotten me,\" Alek said. In those first days land dreadnoughts had stalked the hills in every direction, lookouts swarming their spar decks. But lately the fugitives had seen only an occasional aeroplane buzzing overhead. \"You are not forgotten, Your Highness,\" Volger said flatly. \"Serbia simply presents an easier target.\" \"Unlucky for them,\" Alek said softly. \"Luck had nothing to do with it,\" Volger muttered. \"The empire has wanted a war with Serbia for years now. The rest is an excuse.\" \"An excuse?\" Alek said, anger rising as he imagined his murdered parents\u0027 faces. But he couldn\u0027t argue with Volger\u0027s logic. The dreadnoughts hunting him were German and Austrian, after all. His family had been destroyed by old friends, not some hapless gang of Serbian schoolboys. \"But my father always argued for peace.\" \"And he can argue no longer. Clever, isn\u0027t it?\" Alek shook his head. \"You horrify me, Volger. I sometimes think you admire the people behind this.\" \"Their plans have a certain elegance - assassinating a peacemaker to start a war. But they made one very foolish mistake.\" The man turned and faced him. \"They left you alive.\" \"I don\u0027t matter, not anymore.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-leviathan-1/page-6.html","bookId":1574,"book":{"id":1574,"title":"Leviathan (Leviathan #1)","description":"Storyline: Leviathan (Leviathan #1) Prince Aleksander, would-be heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, is on the run.
