{"id":110288,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Alek set his jaw. At least he\u0027d accomplished something. \"A TILTED TALK.\" That young airman, Dylan, might have frozen to death if he\u0027d lain in the snow all night. But Alek had saved him from frostbite. Maybe this was how you stayed sane in wartime: a handful of noble deeds amid the chaos. Of course, Dylan had betrayed him five minutes later. Where was the sanity in that? Keys jangled in the corridor, and Alek turned from the porthole. The slanted door swung open, and in walked ... \"You,\" Alek growled. Dylan smiled at him. \"Aye, it\u0027s me. I hope you\u0027re well.\" \"No thanks to you, you ungrateful little swine.\" \"Now that\u0027s a bit rude. Especially when I\u0027ve brought you a bit of company.\" Dylan bowed, sweeping an arm toward the doorway. \"May I present Dr. Nora Barlow.\" Another person strode into the room, and Alek\u0027s eyes widened. Instead of an airman\u0027s uniform she wore a gaudy dress and a small black hat, and held the leash of a bizarre doglike creature. What was a woman doing on this ship? \"Pleasure to meet you,\" she said. \"Alek, isn\u0027t it?\" \"At your service.\" As he bowed, the strange beast nuzzled Alek\u0027s hand, and he tried not to flinch. \"Are you the ship\u0027s doctor? If so, I\u0027m quite unhurt.\" The woman laughed. \"I\u0027m sure you are. But I\u0027m not a medical doctor.\" Alek frowned, then realized that her black hat was a bowler. She was one of the Darwinist fabricators, a practitioner of their ungodly science! He looked down in horror at the creature snuffling his trouser leg. \"What is this? Why have you brought this beast here?\" \"Oh, don\u0027t be afraid of Tazza,\" the woman said. \"He\u0027s perfectly harmless.\" \"I\u0027m not telling you anything,\" Alek said, trying to keep the fear from his voice. \"I don\u0027t care what this godless animal does to me.\" \"What, Tazza?\" Dylan let out a laugh. \"I reckon he could lick you to death. And he\u0027s perfectly natural, by the way. What they call a thylacine.\" Alek glared at the boy. \"Then kindly take it away.\" The Darwinist woman settled herself on a chair at the high end of the tilted cabin, looking down at him imperiously. \"I\u0027m sorry if Tazza makes you nervous, but he has nowhere else to go. Your German friends have made rather a mess of our ship.\" \"I\u0027m not German.\" \"No, you\u0027re Austrian. But the Germans are your allies, are they not?\" Alek didn\u0027t answer. The woman was just guessing. \"And what would a young Austrian be doing so high in these mountains?\" she continued. \"Especially now, in wartime?\" He stared at Dr. Barlow, wondering if it was worth trying to reason with her. Though she was a woman, she was also a scientist, and the Darwinists worshipped science. She might have power on this ship. \"It doesn\u0027t matter why I\u0027m here,\" he said, trying to use his father\u0027s tone of command. \"What matters is that you have to let me go.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because if you don\u0027t, my family will come to get me. And believe me, you don\u0027t want that!\" Dr. Barlow narrowed her eyes. The ship\u0027s officers had only laughed at his threats. But she was listening to him. \"So your family knows where you are,\" she said. \"Did they send you here?\" He shook his head. \"No. But they\u0027ll guess, soon enough. You don\u0027t have much time to let me go.\" \"Ah ... time is of the essence.\" The woman smiled. \"So your family lives nearby?\" Alek frowned. He hadn\u0027t meant to give that away. \"Then I suppose we must find them, and quickly.\" She turned to Dylan. \"What do you suggest, Mr. Sharp?\" The young airman shrugged. \"I suppose we could follow his tracks backward in the snow. Maybe bring a present for his ma, so there are no hard feelings.\" Alek shot the boy a cold look. It was one thing to be betrayed, but quite another to be mocked. \"I was careful with my tracks. And if you do manage to find my family, you\u0027ll only get yourselves shot. They hate strangers.\" \"What unsociable people,\" Dr. Barlow said. \"And yet they hired English tutors of the highest caliber for you.\" Alek turned back to the porthole and took a deep breath. Once again his speech and manner were giving him away. It was infuriating. The woman continued, amused that he was upset. \"I suppose we shall have to use other means, Mr. Sharp. Shall we introduce Alek to the young Huxleys?\" \"The Huxleys?\" A smile spread across Dylan\u0027s face. \"That\u0027s a brilliant idea, ma\u0027am!\" Alek stiffened. \"Who are they?\" \"A Huxley isn\u0027t a who, you ninny,\" Dylan said. \"It\u0027s more of a what, being mostly made of jellyfish.\" Alek glared at the boy, certain he was being mocked again. They led him through the ship, a busy warren of slanted corridors and strange smells. The other crewmen hardly glanced at Alek as they passed, and his only guards were Dr. Barlow and Dylan, who looked as skinny as a rail. It was all rather insulting. Maybe the creature Tazza was more dangerous than they\u0027d admitted. Of course, running was pointless. Even if he found his way out of the ship, his captors had taken his snowshoes, and he was already half frozen. He wouldn\u0027t last an hour on the glacier. They went up a spiral staircase that was tilted, like the rest of the ship, at a precarious angle. The smells grew stranger as they climbed. Tazza began to sniff the air, hopping on his hind legs along the slanted floor. Dylan came to a halt beneath a hatch in the ceiling and stooped to gather the beast into his arms. He climbed up through the hatchway, disappearing into darkness overhead. As Alek followed, he sensed a huge space opening up around him. His eyes adjusted slowly. The high, curved walls were a mottled translucent pink, and a segmented white arch stretched overhead, the air heavy with unfamiliar smells. Alek realized how warm he was, and the truth hit him. \"God\u0027s wounds,\" he murmured. \"Brilliant, isn\u0027t it?\" Dylan asked. \"Brilliant?\" Alek\u0027s throat closed on the word, a sharp taste in his mouth. The segmented arches around him were a giant spine! \"This is ... disgusting. We\u0027re inside an animal!\" Suddenly the tilted walkway beneath his feet felt slippery and unstable. Dylan laughed, turning to help Dr. Barlow up through the hatch. \"Aye, but the skins of your zeppelins are made of cattle gut. That\u0027s like being inside an animal, isn\u0027t it? And so\u0027s wearing a leather jacket!\" \"But this one\u0027s alive!\" Alek sputtered. \"True,\" Dylan said, heading down the metal walkway with Tazza. \"And being inside a dead animal is much more awful, if you think about it. You Clankers really are an odd bunch.\" Alek didn\u0027t bother answering this nonsense. He was too busy staring at his feet and staying in the exact center of the walkway. It was tilted more than the rest of the wrecked ship, and the thought of slipping off and actually touching the pinkish innards of this godless monster was too awful to bear. \"Sorry about the smell,\" Dylan said, \"but this is the beastie\u0027s digestive tract.\" \"Digestive tract? Are you taking me to be eaten?\" Dylan laughed. \"We could probably use your hydrogen!\" \"Now, now, Mr. Sharp. Don\u0027t give me any ideas,\" Dr. Barlow said. \"I simply want to show Alek how easily we can find his family.\" \"Aye,\" Dylan said. \"And there\u0027s a Huxley now!\" Alek squinted into the gloom. He saw a tangle of ropes ahead of them. They stirred slowly back and forth, like willow branches in a breeze. \"Look higher, you daft git!\" Dylan said. Alek forced his eyes to follow the swaying ropes up the awful pink walls. A shape floated there in the gloom, bulbous and indistinct. \"Oi, beastie!\" Dylan cried, and one of the ropes seemed to move in response, curling like a cat\u0027s tail. They weren\u0027t ropes at all... . Alek swallowed. \"What is that thing?\" \"Have you not been listening?\" Dylan said. \"It\u0027s a Huxley, a sort of jellyfish full of hydrogen. Looks like it\u0027s had a growth spurt too. Watch this!\" He dashed toward the dangling ropes - or tentacles? - and grabbed a handful, pulling his feet up to swing along the catwalk. The other tentacles curled and flailed, but Dylan climbed higher, pulling the bulbous object down toward himself. Alek could see its piebald skin all too clearly now. It was covered with bulges - like blisters, or the warts on a frog\u0027s skin. And yet, despite his horror, Alek found himself fascinated by the alien grace of the tendrils. The beast was like something from the deep ocean, or a dream. Watching it left him half disgusted and half hypnotized. Tazza ran beneath Dylan as he swung, nipping at his boots and barking. The boy laughed, still climbing, dragging the swollen creature down until he was almost touching its horrid skin. Finally he let go, landing with a clang on the metal walkway. The angry tentacles slithered around him as the creature shot back into the upper reaches of the beast\u0027s innards. \"That one\u0027s getting strong,\" Dr. Barlow said. \"It\u0027ll be ready soon.\" \"Ready for what?\" Alek asked softly. \"To carry me.\" Dylan smiled. \"The big ones can take an airman up a mile! We\u0027ve got a few adult Huxleys living deeper in.\" Alek stared up at the creature. A mile ... more than a kilometer and a half. From that height they\u0027d easily spot the castle\u0027s rectangular shape, or even glimpse the Stormwalker standing in the courtyard. \"I see you understand, Alek,\" Dr. Barlow said. \"We\u0027ll find your family soon enough. Perhaps you should save us the bother.\" Alek took a slow breath. \"Why should I help you?\" \"You already tried to help us,\" she replied. \"And, yes, I know you\u0027ve been treated abominably in return. But you can\u0027t blame us for being suspicious. There is a war on, after all.\" \"So why make more enemies than you\u0027ve already got?\" \"Because we need your help - your family\u0027s help. Without it we may all die.\" Alek stared hard into the woman\u0027s eyes. She was completely serious. \"You can\u0027t fix the ship, can you?\" Dr. Barlow shook her head slowly, and Alek turned away. If the Darwinists really were stuck here, the only way to save them was to give up the castle and all its stores. It was that or let them starve. But could he trade his own men\u0027s safety, maybe even the future of his empire, for a hundred lives? He needed to talk to Volger. \"Let me go,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ll see what we can do.\" \"Perhaps if you took us to your home?\" Dr. Barlow said. \"Under flag of truce, to prevent any unpleasantness.\" Alek thought for a moment, then nodded. They were going to find the castle anyway. \"All right. But we don\u0027t have much time.\" \"I shall talk to the captain.\" She snapped for Tazza. \"Mr. Sharp, I believe you have duties in the machine room.\" \"Aye, ma\u0027am,\" Dylan said. \"But what about Alek? Shall I lock him up again?\" Dr. Barlow looked at Alek. \"Bella gerant alii?\" Alek nodded again. \"This isn\u0027t my war to wage.\" The woman gave him a smile, and turned to lead Tazza away. \"I think we can trust Alek not to run amok, Mr. Sharp. Feel free to take him to the machine room with you. He\u0027s a very well brought-up boy.\" She and Tazza disappeared into the gloom, the dangling tentacles of the Huxleys swirling in their wake. \"You understood what she said?\" Dylan asked. \"That bit in boffin-speak?\" Alek rolled his eyes. \"It\u0027s called Latin, you simpleton. Bella gerant alii means \u0027Let others wage war.\u0027 She was saying we don\u0027t have to fight each other.\" \"You know Latin?\" Dylan laughed. \"You\u0027re barking posh, aren\u0027t you?\" Alek frowned, realizing his mistake. \"What I am is stupid.\" Dr. Barlow was still testing him, trying to figure out who and what he really was. No smuggler\u0027s son or mountain villager would have understood Latin, but he\u0027d answered her without blinking. The strange thing was, the phrase she\u0027d uttered was part of an old saying about the Hapsburgs, how they\u0027d gained more lands by marriage than war. Was she a mind reader as well as a scientist? The sooner he was away from these Darwinists, the better. TWENTY-SIX As they walked back toward the hatchway, Dylan said, \"The lady boffin must think you\u0027re something special.\" Alek looked at him. \"What do you mean?\" \"That machine room is supposed to be off-limits.\" Dylan leaned closer, whispering, \"There\u0027s something barking odd in there.\" Alek didn\u0027t answer, wondering what could possibly qualify as odd in this menagerie of abominations. In the last few hours he\u0027d seen enough uncanny creatures for a lifetime. \"But I suppose it\u0027s all right,\" Dylan continued. \"Seeing as how you\u0027ve decided to help us.\" \"No thanks to you.\" Dylan came to a halt. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"If it were just you stranded on this glacier, I wouldn\u0027t lift a finger.\" \"Well, that\u0027s a bit rude!\" \"A bit rude?\" Alek sputtered. \"I brought you medicines. I saved you from ... frostbitten bum. And when I asked you to keep quiet, you set those awful dogs on me!\" \"Aye,\" Dylan said. \"But you were running off.\" \"I had to go home!\" \"Well, I had to stop you.\" Dylan folded his arms. \"I took an oath to the Air Service, and to King George, to protect this ship. So I couldn\u0027t go making promises to some intruder I\u0027d just met, could I?\" Alek looked away, his anger suddenly exhausted. \"Well, I suppose you were doing your duty.\" \"Aye, I suppose so too.\" Dylan turned with a huff and started walking again. \"And I was going to thank you for not shooting me.\" \"You\u0027re most welcome.\" \"And special thanks for not burning up the whole ship. Including yourself, you daft bum-rag.\" \"I didn\u0027t know the air was full of hydrogen.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you smell it?\" Dylan laughed. \"Those fancy tutors didn\u0027t teach you much useful, did they?\" Alek didn\u0027t argue - among the things he\u0027d learned from his tutors was how to ignore insults. Instead he asked, \"So is that hydrogen I\u0027m smelling now?\" \"Not in here,\" Dylan said. \"The digestive tract has regular air, except for a wee bit of extra methane. That\u0027s why it smells like cow farts.\" \"My education continues,\" Alek said with a sigh. Dylan gestured up at the pink curved walls. \"See those puffy bits between the ribs? Those are hydrogen bladders. And the whole top half of the whale is full of the stuff. What you\u0027re seeing is just the gut - a wee sliver. The beastie\u0027s two hundred feet from top to bottom!\" More than sixty meters - Alek felt a bit unsteady on his feet. \"Makes you feel like a tick on a dog, doesn\u0027t it?\" Dylan said, opening the hatch. He hooked his boots around the ladder\u0027s edges and slid down, hitting the deck with a thump. \"A charming image,\" Alek muttered, feeling a shiver of relief as he climbed back down into the gondola. It was good to have a sturdy deck under his feet again, even if it was tilted, and walls that were solid instead of membranes and bladders. \"But I prefer machines, I\u0027m afraid.\" \"Machines!\" Dylan cried. \"Barking useless. Give me fabricated species any day.\" \"Really?\" Alek said. \"Have your scientists bred anything that can run as fast as a train?\" \"No, but have you Clankers ever made a train that can hunt for its own food, or heal itself, or reproduce?\" \"Reproduce?\" Alek laughed. For a moment he imagined a litter of baby train cars populating a railroad yard, which led his mind to other aspects of the mating process. \"Of course not. What a repulsive idea.\" \"And trains need tracks to run,\" Dylan said, ticking off points on his fingers. \"An elephantine can move across any sort of terrain.\" \"So can walkers.\" \"Walkers are rubbish compared to real beasties! Clumsy as a drunk monkey, and they can\u0027t even get up when they fall!\" Alek snorted, though that last part was true of the bigger dreadnoughts. \"Well, if your \u0027beasties\u0027 are so wonderful, then how did the Germans shoot you down? With machines.\" Dylan gave him a dark look, pulling off a glove. His bare hand curled into a fist. \"Ten to one, and all of them went down too. And I\u0027ll bet they didn\u0027t land as softly.\" Alek realized he\u0027d said too much. Dylan probably knew crewmen who\u0027d been wounded, or even killed, in the crash. For a moment Alek wondered if the boy was going to punch him. But Dylan simply spat on the floor and turned to stalk away. \"Wait,\" Alek called. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" The boy stopped but didn\u0027t turn around. \"Sorry about what?\" \"That your ship\u0027s so badly hurt. And for saying I\u0027d let you starve.\" \"Come on,\" Dylan said gruffly. \"We\u0027ve got eggs to tend to.\" Alek blinked, then hurried to follow. Eggs? They made their way to a small room on the gondola\u0027s middle deck. It was a mess - machine parts strewn across the floor, along with broken glass and sprigs of hay. It felt oddly warm in here, with a smell like ... \"Is that brimstone?\" Alek asked. \"The scientific name is sulfur. See here?\" Dylan led him to a large box in a corner, which steamed with heat in the cold air. \"Eggs have loads of sulfur in them, and most of these are broken, thanks to your German pals.\" Alek blinked in the gloom. The rounded shapes before him looked exactly like ... giant eggs.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-leviathan-1/page-20.html","bookId":1574,"book":{"id":1574,"title":"Leviathan (Leviathan #1)","description":"Storyline: Leviathan (Leviathan #1) Prince Aleksander, would-be heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, is on the run.
