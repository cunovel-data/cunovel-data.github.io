{"id":96933,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"26 \"THE LATE AFTERNOON WAS heavenly. To be that in love, to know that frenzy of the heart -- even now, young as I still am, I look back on it as something that was part of the innocence of childhood. That it could come again, I don\u0027t even dream of, that I should ever know such consuming happiness is impossible. \"After Mona woke, had her bath and put on her fresh Wal-Mart white pants and shirt we went down to walk around Blackwood Farm, and it seemed our roaming is what kept me sane as I spilled out my soul to Mona. I told her all about Goblin, all about Lynelle, all about my strange life as I perceived it. \"She was an eager listener. Also she was charmed by the house and the long drive lined by the pecan trees. It didn\u0027t seem vulgar or overdone to her. She said she saw a symmetry and harmony in everything. \"Yes, it was bigger and more overbearing than a Garden District house, she conceded, but she could see why Manfred Blackwood didn\u0027t want to be constrained and so he had found his perfect spot in the country. \" \u0027Quinn,\u0027 she said, \u0027we live in houses that were built by people\u0027s dreams, and we have to accept that. We have to revere the dream and realize that someday the house will go to others after us. These houses are personalities in our lives. They have their roles to play.¡¯ \"She looked at the big columns. She liked the feeling of the place. \" \u0027Even the house I grew up in,\u0027 she said, \u0027poor as it was, it was a huge Victorian on St. Charles Avenue. It was chock-full of ghosts and people. You know, I didn\u0027t grow up rich. I was a poor kind of down-at-the-heel Mayfair when it comes right down to it. My parents were both spineless drunks. They gave their lives to the bottle. And now I\u0027m the technical owner of a private plane and the designated heiress to billions of dollars. It makes me crazy sometimes, the switch, but there I go again talking about dreams, because I always dreamed I\u0027d be the Design¨¦e of the Mayfair Legacy.¡¯ \"She started to look a little bit sad, which alarmed me. \" \u0027Someday I have to tell you all about our family,\u0027 she said. \u0027But right now I\u0027m with you. Tell me about you.¡¯ \"I thought she was absolutely brilliant. I had never thought much about the kind of woman I\u0027d marry, if any, and now it seemed perfectly right that she be brilliant as well as beautiful. And her beauty, it was natural. She wore no lipstick or eyebrow pencil. She had come out of the shower pure and young. I was totally captivated. \"It was getting dusk. The sky was streaked with amethyst and burning gold. I took her down to the old cemetery. I explained to her how the West Ruby River fed our lonely two hundred acres of Sugar Devil Swamp. \"I told her about Sugar Devil Island and the Hermitage, about the strange inscription on the mausoleum and about the strange trespasser breaking into the house, and that it was his attack which got me taken to Mayfair Medical. \" \u0027Can we go to the island, Quinn?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Can you show me? I have to see this place for myself. How can I be Ophelia forever if I fear to travel ever-flowing streams?¡¯ \" \u0027Well, not now, my precious immortal Ophelia,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s getting dark and I\u0027m not macho enough to be going into the swamp in the dark. But I can take you there in the day. You saw the security guys all around? We\u0027ll take two of them with us. That way if the stranger shows his face we can blast him.¡¯ \"She was very curious. She wanted to know more about the Hermitage and its circular structure. Had there been a stairs up to the cupola? \" \u0027Yes, there is, and you know I never went up there. It was a circular iron stairs, and I hardly took notice of it, and I\u0027m sure if you go up there you can have a better view over the swamp to Blackwood Manor.¡¯ \" \u0027I just have to see it,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s too grandly mysterious. And what do you plan to do about the trespasser?¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027m moving him out!\u0027 I said. \u0027He\u0027s already in a rage that I burnt his books. Well, when I get back out there with my men we\u0027re throwing out his marble table and his golden chair. He\u0027ll find them sunk in the muck where he dumped the bodies.¡¯ \" \u0027What bodies?\u0027 She was amazed. \"I doubled back and told her that part -- of how I\u0027d first seen him in the moonlight, dumping the bodies. She was very intrigued. \" \u0027But this is a killer, this person,\u0027 she said. \" \u0027I\u0027m not afraid of him,\u0027 I countered. \u0027And after what happened when he attacked me upstairs, I know that Goblin can and will protect me.¡¯ \"I glanced back at Goblin who was coming behind us at a distance. I nodded at him. My brave companion. \"She looked at the darkening purple sky. The cicadas were singing everywhere. It seemed the Earth was purring. \u0027Boy, I wish there was time for us to go out there,\u0027 she said. \"I laughed. \u0027Neither of us has the sense to be afraid!\u0027 I admitted. She began laughing and then both of us were laughing, unable to stop it. I put my arms around her finally and just held her, happier than I\u0027d ever been in my whole existence. \"We walked on together, but all I could think of was lying down with her on the grass and letting the gathering shadows be the bed curtains. \"I told her again that when we went out to the island tomorrow we\u0027d take the armed guards. I had my thirty-eight. I asked if she knew how to shoot a gun. She said Yes, she\u0027d been taught at a place called Gretna Gun by her cousin Pierce, just so she\u0027d be able to protect herself if she ever had to. She was used to firing a three fifty-seven Magnum. \" \u0027This Pierce,\u0027 I said, \u0027I don\u0027t want to talk about him. The marriage plan is a dreadful miscarriage of fate. I feel like Romeo standing in the way of whatshisname.¡¯ \"She laughed in the most delightful manner. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s so good to be with you,\u0027 she said. \u0027And part of it is simply that you\u0027re not one of us.¡¯ \" \u0027You mean that I\u0027m not a Mayfair?¡¯ \"She nodded. The tears were threatening. I put my arms around her and she laid her head on my chest and I could feel her crying. \" \u0027Mona, don\u0027t, please don\u0027t. Feel safe with me.¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, I do,\u0027 she said. \u0027I really do, but you know they\u0027re going to find me.¡¯ \" \u0027Then maybe we can just hide you behind those big columns,\u0027 I said. \u0027We can just bolt the door to my room and see if they can break it down.¡¯ \"She stopped. She was all right for the moment and she wiped her eyes with a paper tissue. She asked me to describe the stranger again, and I did, and she asked if he could have been some sort of ghost or spirit. \"It was the most surprising question. I had never thought of that. \" \u0027There are all kinds of ghosts, Tarquin,\u0027 she said. \u0027And they differ in the illusions they can create.¡¯ \" \u0027No, he wasn\u0027t a ghost,\u0027 I said. \u0027He was too outraged by the flying glass to be a ghost. And he couldn\u0027t see Goblin.¡¯ \"Goblin was still with us, trailing in a desultory fashion and unresponsive when I waved. \"Now, it was the time of day when I usually felt the panic most keenly, but I didn\u0027t feel it because I had to be strong for her, and frankly she just created some sustained excitement in me which had banished the panic and all my bad and sad thoughts. \"I told her about the phantoms I saw, here among the tombs. And how they didn\u0027t speak, and they seemed a coagulated mass, and we talked about the nature of ghosts in general. \"She said Stirling Oliver of the Talamasca was a kindhearted and profoundly honorable man, British to the core, like all the best of the Talamasca, and full of wonderful ideas about ghosts and spirits. \" \u0027Now, I don\u0027t know if there is such a thing as a true spirit,\u0027 she said as we were stepping respectfully among the gravestones and around the long-raised tombs. \u0027I tend to think that all spirits are the ghosts of something, even if they lived so long ago in the flesh they don\u0027t remember it.¡¯ \" \u0027Goblin\u0027s a pure spirit,\u0027 I said. \u0027He\u0027s not the ghost of anyone.\u0027 I looked back to see Goblin some distance away, with his hands in the pockets of his jeans, just watching us. I was afraid to say too much about him, about the speed with which he was learning, about his more dangerous aspects. \"But I turned and I waved at him, just a friendly wave, and I told him telepathically that I loved him. He didn\u0027t acknowledge me but his face wasn\u0027t mean, and all of a sudden I realized that he was again wearing my lucky Versace tie. Why was he doing that? Why was he all dressed up and wearing that tie? Maybe it meant nothing. \"I think Mona saw this -- my noticing him. Well, I\u0027m sure she did. But she went on. \u0027You never know with a spirit,\u0027 she said. \u0027It could be the ghost of something that wasn\u0027t human.¡¯ \" \u0027How on earth is that possible, Mona?\u0027 I asked. \u0027You mean it would be the ghost of an animal?¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027m saying things exist in this world that look human but aren\u0027t human, and there\u0027s no real telling how many species of these there are. There are beings walking the Earth fully disguised as humans, deliberately fooling us. So when it comes to a spirit, you never know what you\u0027re dealing with. It could be something good and loving, like Goblin.\u0027 She glanced at him. In fact, she smiled at him. \u0027Or it could be the ghost of something dreadful that secretly despises humankind and wants to hurt it. But the main thing is to understand that all spirits have a kind of organization.¡¯ \" \u0027How do you mean?¡¯ \" \u0027I mean that even though they\u0027re invisible to most people, they have a perceivable form and a nucleus of sorts in which the brain and the heart reside together.¡¯ \" \u0027But how do you know?\u0027 I said. \u0027And how is that possible?¡¯ \" \u0027Well, first off,\u0027 she said, \u0027it\u0027s what Stirling believes and he\u0027s been studying ghosts his entire lifetime. That\u0027s why he\u0027s spending so much time of late with me. I see ghosts constantly. And it\u0027s also what Rowan believes, you know, my cousin Dr. Rowan Mayfair.¡¯ \" \u0027But where is this nucleus? And how is it that a ghost can appear and disappear?¡¯ \" \u0027Science hasn\u0027t caught up with it yet,\u0027 she said, \u0027that\u0027s what Rowan is always telling me. But we have definite ideas about it. The nucleus and the particles that make up a ghost are simply too small to be seen by us and the force field that organizes them can pass effortlessly through the molecules that we can see. Think of tiny insects and how simple it is for them to pass through hardware cloth. Think of water passing through cotton or silk. That\u0027s the way ghosts pass through walls. It\u0027s all there to be known someday but right now we don\u0027t know it.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, I see what you mean, as to how the ghost comes and goes through matter, but how does it appear to us?¡¯ \" \u0027It draws particles of matter to itself magnetically and organizes them into the illusion. The illusion can be so strong that it looks and feels solid. But it\u0027s always an illusion, and when the ghost wants to disappear, or has to disappear, the particles are diffused.¡¯ \"I was too entranced to argue with her. She took it very seriously, what she had to say, and all I had really were questions. But I knew that Goblin was listening too, and I would have been more frightened on that account if I hadn\u0027t known she knew it also. \" \u0027Now, some ghosts,\u0027 she said, \u0027those that are really strong, can make themselves so solid that they\u0027re visible not just to one or two receptive persons but to everybody. They\u0027re there,\u0027 she said. \u0027And God only knows how many of those ghosts are walking around among us.¡¯ \" \u0027My God, what a concept,\u0027 I said. \" \u0027Just think of it -- something that looks human but it\u0027s a ghost, it\u0027s come back to have another go at life or something. But most of the time a ghost uses his organizing principles to appear to one receptive individual.¡¯ \" \u0027But how is it you and I both see Goblin?\u0027 I asked. \" \u0027It must be that we have the same kinds of receptors,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m sure we do. And some of the ghosts I see? You probably could see them also.¡¯ \" \u0027That\u0027s why we have to get married, Mona,\u0027 I said. \u0027We\u0027ll only be lonely for understanding if we marry other people. We\u0027ll always remember this moment.¡¯ \"The comment startled her or in some milder way caught her off guard. Then she said a little testily: \" \u0027Quinn, stop talking about our wedding as if it\u0027s something that\u0027s going to happen. I told you. I\u0027m going to marry Pierce. I have to marry Pierce. Now maybe we could have an affair afterwards, but I seriously don\u0027t think so, I think Pierce would be way devastated. That\u0027s the worst thing about marrying Pierce. When I marry him, my erotic adventures will be over.¡¯ \" \u0027That\u0027s a wretched thing to look forward to. I hate this guy Pierce. Maybe I\u0027ll kill him.¡¯ \" \u0027Don\u0027t talk like that, he\u0027s the sweetest Mayfair on the planet,\u0027 she replied, \u0027and he\u0027ll take care of me. Oh, let\u0027s not talk about Pierce. Sometimes I know Pierce deserves somebody better than me and there are so many unsullied virginal types in the family! Maybe you\u0027re right about Pierce. I mean for Pierce\u0027s own sake --. Now let\u0027s get back to the question of ghosts.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said, \u0027explain to me how the nucleus of a ghost is formed, assuming there is one. And let Pierce have one of the virgins, I think that\u0027s a fine idea.¡¯ \" \u0027Stirling says the nucleus is the soul, the soul that refused to move on when it was separated from its earthly body.¡¯ \" \u0027So the soul has matter to it!¡¯ \" \u0027Maybe more what we call electricity,\u0027 she said, \u0027or energy, at any rate. Let\u0027s think of it that way, something infinitesimal that is organized energy. It\u0027s all through our bodies when we\u0027re alive, but it contracts to a nucleus when we die, and that nucleus should go into the Light, as we well know. And instead of going out of our stratosphere, as it should when it disconnects from the body, it stays behind, earthbound, and generates for itself a spirit body, a body of energy imprinted by the shape of its lost human body, and that\u0027s how it acquires its characteristics as a ghost.¡¯ \" \u0027And you think that it can forget that it was ever human?¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, I think so definitely. There must be earthbound spirits which are a thousand years old. There\u0027s no ticking clock for them. There\u0027s no hunger. There\u0027s no thirst. Without us to make them focus and tighten, they simply drift. I\u0027m not even certain what they see or know when they drift, but then along comes a person who can respond to them, and they begin to evolve as a ghost for that person.¡¯ \" \u0027And you call yourself a witch because you can see these spirits?¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, and because I can talk to them, but I can\u0027t just make them do what I want. I haven\u0027t experimented with that power. That\u0027s too dangerous a power. The whole subject is dangerous, Tarquin.\u0027 She lowered her voice and she made a sly glance with her eyes at Goblin. \u0027Goblin probably knows, don\u0027t you, Goblin?\u0027 she asked. \u0027He probably knows all of this.¡¯ \"I looked back at Goblin. Goblin\u0027s face was thoughtful. It had lost some of its meanness, and this relieved me somewhat. \" \u0027Mona, we have to be together, always,\u0027 I said. \u0027Who else will ever love me the way you can?¡¯ \"Goblin drew closer. I put my hand out to stop him. \" \u0027Be patient with me now, Goblin,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s a different kind of love.¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027d never seek to take your place, Goblin,\u0027 said Mona. \" \u0027But truly, Mona,\u0027 I addressed her again. \u0027Who else will ever love me the way you can?¡¯ \" \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re tall and gorgeous and you have the most honest blue eyes I\u0027ve ever seen. You know it\u0027s really something when a man has both blue eyes and jet black hair, and that\u0027s what you\u0027ve got. You\u0027re what girls call adorable.¡¯ \"Of course I loved hearing these compliments -- I was very unsure of myself -- but they only strengthened my hope that nothing could separate us. \" \u0027Marry me, Mona,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m serious. You just have to.¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027m beginning to like the idea, but behave yourself,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Let\u0027s go on about ghosts and spirits. You need to know things. We were talking about earthbound spirits, how they fail to go into the Light.¡¯ \" \u0027Are you sure of the Light yourself, Mona?\u0027 I asked her. \" \u0027Well, you see, that\u0027s the very problem,\u0027 she answered. \u0027When these people die they aren\u0027t sure of it, and they may not recognize the Light for what it is. They may not trust it. They cling to the Earth; they cling to mortals whom they can still see and hear.¡¯ \" \u0027And so we have this theoretical spirit whose nucleus doesn\u0027t go into the Light,\u0027 I said, \u0027this soul that drifts --.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, \u0027and it can start a whole adventure for itself, especially if it finds a receptive person like you or me, somebody who can see it even when its organizing powers are still weak. Then of course we help it focus by noticing it and talking to it, and paying attention to it, and its organization becomes stronger and stronger.¡¯ \" \u0027But what about a spirit like Goblin? He\u0027s not a ghost. He doesn\u0027t know where he came from.¡¯ \"She shot me a meaningful glance that said: Be careful. \u0027Goblin is pure spirit then,\u0027 she replied, \u0027but spirits are probably organized in exactly the same way -- they have the nucleus and then a kind of loose body, a force field of a body, and it\u0027s this force field they use, just like a ghost, to gather particles to appear to someone.¡¯ \"We walked on out of the cemetery and towards the landing. The swamp looked dark and treacherous already -- full of deadly things that want to kill. An evening song came from it that meant death. I tried to ignore it. Mona seemed to like it, to like the evening. \" \u0027Quinn, if only you could talk to Stirling,\u0027 she said. \u0027I think he would have so much to tell you. You know, it\u0027s so easy with Stirling. For centuries the Talamasca has given shelter to people who see ghosts. They welcome people like you and me, and not for selfish reasons. When I was in England I went to their Motherhouse there, and I even visited the Motherhouse in Rome.¡¯ \" \u0027Sounds religious, rather like the Trappist monks or the Carmelites.¡¯ \" \u0027Well, they are sort of that way,\u0027 she answered, \u0027but they aren\u0027t religious. They\u0027re good without being religious. Sometimes it\u0027s hard for Fr. Kevin to accept but he\u0027s getting used to it. You know how it is with us Catholics. Anything supernatural that isn\u0027t from God just has to be evil. And here you have the Talamasca studying the supernatural. But even Fr. Kevin is coming to like Stirling. Nobody could fail to be disarmed by Stirling.¡¯ \" \u0027Tell me about Fr. Kevin,\u0027 I said. \u0027What\u0027s his story?¡¯ \" \u0027He\u0027s a good priest,\u0027 she said. \u0027I ought to know. I tried hard to get him into bed, as I told you, but couldn\u0027t do it. He was born here in a big house on Magazine Street, the last of eight children. His eldest sister is a whole nother generation. We call them the Stainless Mayfairs because they are all very good and never get into any trouble. When he went into the priesthood they sent him up North, and now he\u0027s come back, principally because the family needs its own priest and also because he can teach here. He\u0027s quite the theologian when he wants to be.¡¯ \" \u0027Mona, why do you try to go to bed with so many people?\u0027 I asked. I knew that I sounded naive and childlike, but I had to ask her. \" \u0027Why do you do the same thing, Tarquin?¡¯ \" \u0027But I don\u0027t, not really. Aside from you, I\u0027ve been to bed with one of the women on the property and that\u0027s all.¡¯ \" \u0027I know,\u0027 she said smiling. \u0027It\u0027s the gorgeous blond-haired quadroon, Jasmine.¡¯ \" \u0027How did you know?¡¯ \" \u0027We witches have a little bit of telepathic power,\u0027 she said with the same generous smile. \u0027I picked up on it, you might say. Didn\u0027t you feel that that was a road you had to travel?¡¯ \" \u0027Yeah, I guess I did. But compared to you, I\u0027m kind of retarded. I\u0027m almost nineteen and I\u0027ve slept with one spirit, one ghost and two real women, you being the one with whom I am in love.¡¯ \" \u0027I can guess about the spirit,\u0027 she said, \u0027but tell me about the ghost.¡¯ \" \u0027I can\u0027t, not now. We\u0027re too near her grave.\u0027 I pointed to the little headstone in the cemetery. \u0027But let me say her name\u0027s Rebecca and she\u0027s beautiful, and she met her end in a cruel, unjust way and I lost my virginity with her. She has great charm when she comes. . . \" \u0027. . . And speaking of charm,\u0027 I said, \u0027I have a tutor who is like that and he\u0027s coming right towards us.¡¯ \"It was Nash come down from the house to invite us to supper. He looked elegant and handsome in his sharply cut blue denim three-piece suit and a white shirt open at the collar. \"Now, I have to achieve that style, I thought, and he comes by it so daringly and so naturally. \"At once I introduced him to Mona and told him I was going to marry her. He was faintly amazed but accepted it totally seriously. \" \u0027Congratulations, Quinn, and my dear\u0027 -- he took her hand -- \u0027it\u0027s a pleasure.¡¯ \"I felt his mellow voice could level mountains. And his face was truly enhanced by its lines and its folds. It gave him the look of wisdom. \" \u0027Of course, we\u0027re still going to Europe, Nash,\u0027 I said. \u0027We\u0027re all going. We\u0027re stealing Mona.¡¯ \" \u0027Well, that makes things doubly exciting,\u0027 said Nash with just a twinge of a smile and a touch of gentle irony. He gave his arm to Mona graciously to help her up to the high ground, and I felt ashamed that I hadn\u0027t thought to do it. \"As for supper, we were all to join Aunt Queen on the other side of the house where the table was set on the flagstone patio using the newly refurbished wicker. \" \u0027Rebecca\u0027s wicker,\u0027 I explained to Mona. \u0027Rebecca and I -- it was in a dream -- we had coffee together and we were sitting in these wicker chairs. You\u0027ll see.¡¯ \"And I\u0027ll see too, I thought. I\u0027ll see if it matches the furnishings of my dream exactly, because I might have imagined it earlier when I\u0027d wandered out there, so mystified and confused. \"As we walked on, past the front of the house, as I looked up at the reddened and darkening sky, I felt the panic again. \"But I drove it away. Time for something convivial and I was ready for it. \"Quickly I searched for Goblin. Come with us, be with us. I tried to smile at him, but I think he knew my multitude of fears. He could read my face if not my mind.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-26.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
