The entire wall was covered in mirrors, and Petronia sat at a great curve of granite, on a bench that appeared made of the same material, with a velvet cushion on it, while the young Adonis finished her hair.\n \"She was clad as a man in a buff-colored velvet coat and pants, with a ruffled white shirt that would have looked good in the eighteenth century, I well imagined, and at her throat was a huge rectangular cameo that was crowded with little figures, the whole thing surrounded by diamonds.\n \"Her hair was pulled straight back from her face, and the boy was plaiting it for her. She had two threads of diamonds running over her head, which as I\u0027ve mentioned was beautifully shaped for this kind of severity, and the two threads of diamonds were being plaited into her hair.\n \"The room was open to the sea like all the rooms of the palazzo which I had seen, though I think I forgot to mention it with the bath.\n \"The sky appeared violet to me in spite of the hour, and once again the stars seemed to be moving; in fact the sky appeared to be moving into the room.\n \"My breath was quite literally taken away from me, not merely by the stars and their various patterns but by the sheer beauty of Petronia in her sharp male clothing, with her bold head once again revealed by the austerity of her pulled-back hair.\n \"I stood for a long few moments gazing at her as she looked back at me, and then the young Adonis told her softly that the plait was complete and the diamond clasp applied to the end.\n \"She turned around and gave him what appeared to be a very large amount of money and said, \u0027Go out, enjoy yourself, you\u0027ve done well.\u0027 He bowed and backed out of the room, as though he\u0027d been dismissed by the Queen of England, and then he was gone.\n \" \u0027So you find him beautiful, do you?\u0027 she asked.\n \" \u0027Do I? I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said. \u0027Everything charms me. As a human being I was an enthusiast. Now I think I\u0027m losing my mind.¡¯\n \"She rose from the cushioned bench and came towards me, and then she took me in her arms. \u0027All the wounds I inflicted, they\u0027ve healed. Am I right?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, you\u0027re right,\u0027 I said. \u0027Except the wound no one can heal, the one I inflicted on myself, that I killed the innocent young woman, that I murdered her at her own wedding. No one can heal that. And no time will heal it either, and I don\u0027t suppose it should.¡¯\n \"She laughed. \u0027Come, let\u0027s join the others,\u0027 she said. \u0027All your grandfather knows is how to play chess. He was a raving poker player when I first met him. He beat me at it, if you can believe it, and that Rebecca, she was cagey too, I tell you, and don\u0027t go moping after her, but I must tell you -- about the bride, I\u0027ve had the most splendid night.¡¯\n \"Within moments we were in the big room with the ominous and empty gold cage at the end of it. I pictured a giant bird inside it. Certainly I hadn\u0027t looked like a bird. I thought of Caravaggio\u0027s Victorious Cupid. Had I looked a little like that?\n \" \u0027I must tell you what happened,\u0027 Petronia went on, drawing the attention of Arion. \u0027It was the best luck. The bride\u0027s father and husband, you know, were first-rate killers, and of course the little minx knew it, so salve your conscience with that if you wish, Quinn. But they sent an armed guard here tonight, some four bravos as we used to call them, because we were recognized, it seems, and you can imagine the fun I had with them. Now it doesn\u0027t please me to bully mortals, no matter what you think to the contrary, Quinn, but there were four of them.¡¯\n \" \u0027And where are they now?\u0027 said Arion. He sat at the table with the Old Man, who was looking at the chessboard. I sat between them.\n \"Petronia walked up and down in front of us.\n \" \u0027Gone, into the sea,\u0027 she responded. \u0027In their car, over the cliff. Like that. It was nothing. But the fighting here before I disposed of the bodies, now that was a class act.¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Arion with faint disgust. \u0027And that\u0027s made you happy.¡¯\n \" \u0027Supremely happy. I drank my fill from the last one, and that was the finest part of it. No. I take that back. The fight was the finest part of it, killing them before they could draw their weapons and make a nasty hole in my body! It was divinely exciting. It made me think I should fight more often, that it\u0027s not enough to kill.¡¯\n \"Arion shook his head wearily. \u0027You should talk more elegantly for your fledgling. Tell him a few rules.¡¯\n \" \u0027What rules?\u0027 she inquired. She continued to stride back and forth, almost to the windows and then again to the murals, her eyes sweeping the room around her and then seeming to drift over the stars.\n \" \u0027Oh, all right. Rules,\u0027 she said. \u0027You never disclose to any mortal what you are or what we are. How\u0027s that for a rule? You never kill one of our kind. Is that enough for you, Arion? I don\u0027t know that I remember anything else.¡¯\n \" \u0027You know you do,\u0027 he said. He too was looking at the chessboard. He made a move with his queen.\n \" \u0027You cover up the kill as to bring no notice to yourself,\u0027 she said with a flair, \u0027and always, always!\u0027 she stopped and stared at me, pointing her finger in a declarative manner. \u0027Always, you respect your Maker as your Master, and to strike out at your Maker, your Master, is to merit destruction at his or her hands. How\u0027s that?¡¯\n \" \u0027That\u0027s all very good,\u0027 said the Old Man in his deep bass with his jowls trembling. He squeezed my shoulder and smiled at me with his big loose mouth. \u0027Now give him the warnings. He needs warnings.¡¯\n \" \u0027Such as what!\u0027 said Petronia disgustedly. \u0027Don\u0027t be scared of your own shadow!\u0027 she said pointedly. \u0027Don\u0027t act like you\u0027re old when you\u0027re immortal! What else?¡¯\n \" \u0027The Talamasca, tell him about the Talamasca,\u0027 said the Old Man, nodding at me, mouth turned up in the manner of a fish. \u0027They know about us, they do!\u0027 he said with an emphatic nod. \u0027And you mustn\u0027t ever fall for their blandishments. Do you know that word, my son? They flatter you with their curiosity, which is what they do to everyone! Flattery is their calling card. But you must never yield to them. They\u0027re a secret order of psychics and magicians, and they want us! They want to lock us up in their castles here in Europe and study us in their laboratories as though we were rats!¡¯\n \"I was speechless. I tried to wipe my mind clean of all thought of Stirling. But the Old Man was peering at me in a probing fashion.\n \" \u0027Ah, what do I see but that you\u0027ve known them? They\u0027ve already invited themselves into your life because you were a seer of spirits! Oh, this is most dangerous. What is this? A plantation house? You must never risk being in the vicinity of them again.¡¯\n \" \u0027It was all broken off a long time ago,\u0027 I said. \u0027I saw spirits, yes. I\u0027ll probably continue to see them.¡¯\n \"Arion shook his head no. \u0027Ghosts don\u0027t come to our kind, Quinn,\u0027 he said quietly.\n \" \u0027No, indeed not,\u0027 said Petronia, walking and walking. \u0027You\u0027ll find that your familiar has vanished should ever you go back to spy perhaps on those you used to know and love.¡¯\n \"I said nothing.\n \"I looked at the chessboard. I watched the Old Man put Arion\u0027s queen in check.\n \" \u0027What other rules are there?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t make others,\u0027 said Arion, \u0027without the permission of your Maker, or the eldest of those who make up the group in which you live.¡¯\n \" \u0027You mean I can make another?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027Of course you can,\u0027 said Arion, \u0027but you must resist the temptation. As I told you, you can do it only with the permission of Petronia, or in reality, my permission, as you are in my house.¡¯\n \"Petronia made a contemptuous scoffing sound.\n \" \u0027That may come to be your worst temptation,\u0027 said Arion. \u0027But you\u0027re too young and too weak to make the transformation. Remember it, what I\u0027m telling you. Don\u0027t be a fool in this. Don\u0027t share eternity with someone you may come to despise or even hate.¡¯\n \"I nodded.\n \"There was a long silence during which time Petronia stopped at the window and looked out at the stars.\n \" \u0027There is one other warning,\u0027 she said. She turned back and looked at me. \u0027If you go back to the swampland, and some night you might, just to spy on your beloved aunt, that great lady, or for some other simple reason, don\u0027t be tempted to hunt New Orleans. The Talamasca keeps a tight watch for us there, and though they\u0027re bumbling mortals they can do us harm. But there is one other danger and that is a powerful Blood Hunter who styles himself the Vampire Lestat. He rules New Orleans and he destroys young Blood Hunters. He\u0027s ruthless, iconoclastic and self-centered. He\u0027s written books about us which pass as fiction. A lot of the stories in those books are true.¡¯\n \"I was quiet for a long time.\n \"She came over to the table, and, drawing up a chair, she put her arm around Arion and she watched the game. Arion had saved his queen, but just barely, and was now about to be checkmated in a very sly way. I saw it coming but I saw he didn\u0027t by the pieces he was moving and what his eyes were doing, and then quite suddenly there came the Old Man\u0027s surprise move, and Arion sat back, amazed and then smiling and shaking his head.\n \" \u0027Another game!\u0027 he said. He started laughing. \u0027I demand it.¡¯\n \" \u0027And so you shall have it!\u0027 said the Old Man, his face all atremble.\n \"As the Old Man was setting up the pieces I slowly rose to my feet.\n \" \u0027I\u0027m going to leave you, gentlemen,\u0027 I said. \u0027I thank you for your hospitality and your gifts.¡¯\n \" \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 said Petronia.\n \" \u0027I\u0027m going home,\u0027 I said. \u0027I want my family.¡¯\n \" \u0027What do you mean, you\u0027re going home!\u0027 she demanded. \u0027Have you taken leave of your senses?¡¯\n \" \u0027No, I haven\u0027t. And I wish now to abolish our bargain. The Hermitage is mine. I reclaim it as of now. I need the mausoleum for my hiding place by day, and I need the rest of it for a getaway in the night. Now, I\u0027ll leave you to your chess, and again I thank you --.¡¯\n \"Arion rose to his feet.\n \" \u0027But how will you get home?\u0027 he asked gently. \u0027You can defy gravity very well over short distances, and with great speed, perhaps more than you know. But you can\u0027t travel halfway around the world. It will be years before you have that skill.¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027m going the way any mortal would go,\u0027 I responded.\n \" \u0027And what will you do when you get there!\u0027 demanded Petronia, looking up at me.\n \" \u0027Live in my house as I\u0027ve always done,\u0027 I said. \u0027Live in my room where I\u0027ve always lived. Be with my family as I\u0027ve always been. I\u0027ll do that as long as I can. I won\u0027t give them up.¡¯\n \"Petronia rose slowly. \u0027But you don\u0027t know how to pretend to be human. You don\u0027t have the faintest idea.¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 I said. \u0027I watched you do it, and you\u0027re ancient by your stories and yet you managed in a roomful of people. Why should it be so hard for me? Besides, I\u0027m determined to do it. I won\u0027t relinquish the life I had.¡¯\n \" \u0027Won\u0027t you realize,\" Petronia said, \u0027that if you take those mortals into your secret, you\u0027ll destroy them?¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027ll protect them from it with my whole heart,\u0027 I said. \u0027You won\u0027t make me lose my nerve.¡¯\n \" \u0027You can\u0027t just leave here and do this, Quinn,\u0027 said Arion gently. \u0027Besides, why would you? You don\u0027t belong with humans now.¡¯\n \" \u0027Must I ask your permission?\u0027 I countered, looking him directly in the eye.\n \"He shrugged gracefully, just as I knew he would.\n \" \u0027No, you don\u0027t have to ask me.¡¯\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t give a damn what you do!\u0027 said Petronia, just as I knew she would.\n \"I smiled. \u0027Then the Hermitage is now mine?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027Take it as a present from me,\u0027 she said venomously.\n \"I looked down at the Old Man. \u0027Manfred, we\u0027ll meet another night.¡¯\n \" \u0027Be careful, my son,\u0027 he said.\n \"I left the room, and, finding the grand stairs of the palazzo, was soon out, walking down a narrow winding path to the city below.\n \"Within twenty minutes I walked into the lobby of the Hotel Excelsior, where we had stayed on three occasions on our trips to Naples, and went to the desk of the concierge. He remembered me and immediately asked after Aunt Queen.\n \" \u0027I\u0027ve been robbed. Everything\u0027s gone,\u0027 I said. \u0027I need to make a collect call to my aunt.¡¯\n \"The phone was at once placed at my disposal. And a suite was being prepared.\n \"It was Jasmine who answered. She began to sob. When Aunt Queen came on the line, she was damn near hysterical.\n \" \u0027Listen,\u0027 I said. \u0027I can\u0027t explain this, but I\u0027m in Naples, Italy. I need my passport, and I need funds badly.\u0027 I told her over and over again how much I loved her and how unexpected this was, even for me, and that I would never be able to explain, but the thing now was for me to spend a decent night in the hotel and then start the flight home tomorrow evening.\n \"Finally Nash came on the line to give all the appropriate numbers to the cashier, and I was officially set up with every convenience, and I was told that airline tickets would be delivered to me. I explained to Nash that I would only travel at night -- that I wanted to fly from here to Milan on an evening flight, then from Milan to London on another evening flight, and from thence to New York in one evening. From there, of course, I\u0027d return to New Orleans.\n \"When I shut the door of the suite, I went into a state of shock.\n \"It seemed my life had been a series of escalating fears, and this fear I knew now was the worst. It was quiet and cold and worse than panic, and I felt my heart throbbing in my throat. It seemed there would never be any relief from this fear, never any relief from this pain.\n \"Tarquin Blackwood was dead, this I knew perfectly well. But a great remnant of me existed still, and that remnant, dazzled as I was by so many unwelcome gifts, longed only to be with Aunt Queen, with Tommy, with Jasmine, with all my beloved witnesses, my irreplaceable and adored kith and kin.\n \"No, I wouldn\u0027t let go of my family. No, I wouldn\u0027t go quietly from my place at Blackwood Manor and from all those whom I so loved!\n \"No -- not without a struggle would I leave them, not without the noblest attempt to remain with them for as long as I could.\n \"As for Mona, my beloved witch, I would never, never see her again or let her hear my voice over a phone. Never would my evil touch her, never would my true fate be known to her. Never would my pain be mixed with her pain.\n \"An hour must have passed as I stood there, my back to the door, unable to move. I tried to breathe deeply. I tried not to clench my fists. I tried not to be afraid. I tried not to be in a rage.\n \"It was over and done with, this transformation. And I must go on. I must go home. I must do everything gently and with great conviction and love those who loved me with all my heart.\n \"Finally, I lay down on the bed, my throat tight, and my body full of tremors and I felt a sudden overwhelming exhaustion, and fell into a mortal sleep.\n \"It must have been dreamless. No Patsy, no Rebecca, though it did seem that I heard Rebecca laughing again, and that I didn\u0027t care.\n \"The early light awakened me like scalding water.\n \"At once I pulled all the draperies and their under curtains, and was soon in a sweet chilled darkness. Then I crawled under the bed, and soon lost consciousness.\n \"The following evening I had a temporary passport, money in my pockets, a new American Express card and the tickets to commence the journey. As soon as I reached London I realized I had to chart a different course for home, so I made stops in Nova Scotia, Canada, and finally Newark. Then at last I was bound for New Orleans.\n \"During all this time, I practiced, fearfully, my skill at the Little Drink in airports, prowling the big crowds like a swamp cat, stalking this or that victim for hours before the opportune moment, that sweet moment, loving it and loathing it at the same time. There was no doubt in my mind that I looked human to people. I even looked agreeable. And in my hunting, I made no blunders. I made no kills. I never spilt a drop.\n \"Oh, it was an agony of fear and pleasure, drifting through a humanity I could only penetrate as a monster. And the swarming airports became hellish, like vast sets for some existential drama. But I was fast becoming as addicted to the hunt as to the blood.\n \"Finally, I came down the concourse in New Orleans and Aunt Queen opened her arms and then Nash did the same and then my lovely Jasmine and my little son, Jerome, whom I picked up and kissed, crushing him to me totally. And then there was Tommy, my reserved thirteen-year-old uncle, whom I so adored. I had to hug Tommy.\n \"If any of them found anything strange about me it was totally overwhelmed by my enthusiasm. As for how I had gotten to Italy, I promised only that someday I would tell them. Of course they raised bloody hell, but that was all I would say.\n \"As we piled into the limousine to go home, they broke the news to me that Patsy had full-blown AIDS but was responding well to the medicines; however, Seymour was suing her. He had it too, and he claimed she had never told him she had it and that she had given it to him. I didn\u0027t know what to say. I thought of that dream I had, that awful dream. I couldn\u0027t get the images of the dream out of my head.\n \" \u0027How\u0027s she feel?\u0027 I asked. They said fine.\n \" \u0027How\u0027s she look?\u0027 I asked. They said fine.\n \" \u0027How\u0027s the band?\u0027 I asked. They said fine.\n \"That was the end of it.\n \"As soon as I reached the house I hugged Big Ramona and I told her I was too old to be sleeping with her anymore, and she said it was about high time for me to be saying that, that she was just waiting. She couldn\u0027t believe it when I turned down her pancakes.\n \"When I finally reached my room and shut and locked the door, I felt faint and mad. But I had fooled them. I had fooled them and I was back with them. I was with them and I had their love. I began to cry.\n \"I cried and cried. I went into the bathroom and I saw the blood streaming down my face, and that\u0027s how I learned that we cry blood tears, and I wiped away the blood with a paper handkerchief, and I finally stopped crying, and then I realized Goblin was there.\n \"Goblin was sitting in my desk chair, facing me, and Goblin was a full duplicate of me right to the blood in his eyes and the blood tears streaming down his face.\n \"I almost cried out in terror, it was such a sight. My heart stopped beating for a moment and then caught up.\n \"I wiped and wiped at my face. I ran at him.\n \" \u0027Look,\u0027 I said, \u0027I\u0027m wiping them away, can\u0027t you see? I\u0027m wiping them away! Look, they\u0027re gone, the blood is gone, can\u0027t you see?\u0027 I was shouting at him, I was thundering. I had to lower my voice. \u0027Don\u0027t you see! The blood\u0027s gone. I wiped it away!¡¯\n \"He just sat there with the blood in his eyes and the blood dripping down his cheeks and then he ran at me. He ran into me. He merged with me, and I felt myself pushed backwards against the round table and then to the side and to the foot of the bed, and I couldn\u0027t fight him off, he was in me, he was merged with me, and it felt like a pure fatal electric shock, and when he withdrew I saw him huge and filled with tiny droplets of blood, and I collapsed.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-42.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
