I was floating with happiness. I parked half a block away, so as not to be espied by an evil opposing Mayfair, and then, bouquet in hand (I had pushed back the florist paper to make a mere cuff of it) I approached the gate, coming along the fence beneath a great shrub of crape myrtles that were already wildly and beautifully in bloom.\n \"In fact, the entire Garden District seemed fragrantly blooming and the streets so utterly deserted that I did not have to be subjected to ordinary individuals who weren\u0027t in love.\n \"As for Goblin, when he appeared beside me I told him firmly that I had to complete this mission alone, and he was to leave me now if he ever wanted a civil word from me again.\n \" \u0027I love you, I\u0027ve told you that. Now give me my time with Mona,\u0027 I said crossly.\n \"To my astonishment he gave me loving kisses on my cheek and whispered \u0027Au revoir\u0027 to me and obediently disappeared. An aftertaste lingered, a shimmering feeling of good will and deliberate generosity that was as palpable as the breeze.\n \"Of course I had hoped that Mona would be waiting for me with backpack, suitcase and passport in hand.\n \"But soon as I reached the wrought-iron gate a tall, elegant individual came to meet me, shattering my hope of escape with Mona utterly, though he had a most compassionate look on his vibrant face.\n \"He was svelte, if not downright swanky, with prematurely white curly hair and quick inquisitive eyes. His clothes were positively dashing. They looked old-fashioned in cut, like something from a drama about the nineteenth century, but what part of that century I didn\u0027t know.\n \" \u0027Come in, Tarquin,\u0027 he said with a French accent. He turned the brass knob, whereas Mona had used a key. \u0027I\u0027ve been waiting for you. You\u0027re most welcome. Come in. Please. I want to talk with you. Follow me into the garden, if you will.¡¯\n \" \u0027But where\u0027s Mona?\u0027 I asked, being as civil as I knew how.\n \" \u0027Oh, no doubt combing her long red hair,\u0027 he said with the most exquisite intonation, \u0027so that she can throw it over yonder balcony,\u0027 he pointed upwards to the iron railings, \u0027and lure you like Rapunzel did her forbidden prince.¡¯\n \" \u0027Am I forbidden?\u0027 I asked. I tried to resist his beguiling manner but it was difficult.\n \" \u0027Oh, who knows?\u0027 he said with a world-weary sigh, but his smile was brilliant. \u0027Come with me, and call me Oncle Julien, if you will; I\u0027m your Oncle Julien as surely as your Aunt Queen gave her embrace to Mona last night. And, by the way, that was a stunning gift, the cameo. Mona will always treasure it. May I call you Tarquin? I have already, haven\u0027t I? Do I have that much of your trust?¡¯\n \" \u0027You invited me in, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 I replied. \u0027I thank you very much for that.¡¯\n \"We were walking now on a flagstone path beside the house, and to our right lay a great garden with an octagonal pattern of boxwood around its lawn. There were Grecian marble statues here and there -- a Hebe, I think, and a bathing Venus -- and beds of exquisite spring flowers and some small citrus trees, and one bearing a single lemon of monstrous size. I paused to look at it.\n \" \u0027Isn\u0027t it charming?\u0027 he said. \u0027The little tree puts all its heart into the one lemon. If it had many, no doubt they\u0027d be of regular size. You might say the Mayfair clan does something very similar. Here, come let\u0027s walk on.¡¯\n \" \u0027You mean with regard to the Legacy,\u0027 I said. \u0027They put everything into one Design¨¦e,\u0027 I continued, \u0027and she has to be guarded from intrigues with those who aren\u0027t marriageable and I\u0027ve somehow been found wanting?¡¯\n \" \u0027Mon fils,\u0027 he said, \u0027you have been found too young! There\u0027s nothing in you that\u0027s unworthy. It\u0027s only that Mona is fifteen and you are not yet a man. And I must confess a little mystery surrounds you which I will explain.¡¯\n \"We had gone up a few flagstone steps and were now walking past a huge octagonal swimming pool. Hadn\u0027t Aunt Queen said something about Michael Curry almost drowning in this pool? I was befuddled. Everywhere there was beauty. And it was so very quiet.\n \"Oncle Julien drew my attention to the fact that the shape of the pool was the same as that of the lawn. And in each of the short pillars of the balustrade that octagon was repeated.\n \" \u0027Patterns on top of patterns,\u0027 he said. \u0027Patterns attract spirits, spirits who are lost can see patterns, that\u0027s why they like old houses, grand houses, houses with big rooms filled with the touch of kindred spirits. I think sometimes that once a host of spirits have inhabited a house it\u0027s easier for other spirits to get in. It\u0027s an amazing thing. But come, let me take you into the rear garden. And we will escape the patterns to sit for a while beneath the trees.¡¯\n \"It was exactly as he had said. As we passed from the flagstones around the pool through a large open double gateway we found ourselves moving out across a loose lawn to an iron table and chairs beneath a huge oak, where the grass grew sparse and the roots were visible, and other young trees to our right -- willow, magnolia, maple -- were fighting to make a grove.\n \"I could see the word \u0027Lasher\u0027 carved deep into the bark of the oak tree and there was a strange sweet fragrance in the garden, a perfumelike fragrance -- something that I could not associate with flowers. I was shy of asking what the scent was.\n \"We sat down at the black iron table. It was set with cups and saucers for us and a tall thermal pitcher, which he lifted now to serve.\n \" \u0027Hot chocolate, mon fils, what do you say to that?¡¯\n \" \u0027Oh, marvelous,\u0027 I said with a laugh. \u0027How absolutely delicious. I never expected it.\u0027 He filled my cup.\n \" \u0027Ah,\u0027 he said, as he filled his own, \u0027you have no idea what a treat it is for me.¡¯\n \"We sipped, waiting for the temperature to become comfortable, and I saw there were animal crackers on the plate and the old poem by Christopher Morley came to me about this very repast:\n Animal crackers, and cocoa to drink,\n That is the finest of suppers, I think;\n \"Quite suddenly, Oncle Julien recited the next two lines:\n \u0027When I\u0027m grown up and can have what I please\n I think I shall always insist upon these.¡¯\n \"We both laughed.\n \" \u0027Did you plan it on account of the poem?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027Well, I suppose I did,\u0027 he responded. \u0027And because I thought you\u0027d enjoy it.¡¯\n \" \u0027Oh, I\u0027m so thankful. What a thoughtful thing to do.¡¯\n \"I felt high. I felt happy. This man wouldn\u0027t separate me from Mona. He would understand love. But I was forgetting something. I had heard the name Julien Mayfair, I was sure of it. It was in some connection, but I couldn\u0027t remember. . . Surely not from Mona. No.\n \"I looked up and to the left at the long three-story flank of the Mayfair house. It was immense and silent. I didn\u0027t want it to shut me out.\n \" \u0027Do you know of Blackwood Manor?\u0027 I asked suddenly. \u0027It was built in the 1880s. I know this house is far older. We live out in the country. But you have the charm and stillness of the country right here.\u0027 I felt foolish for my candor. What was I trying to prove?\n \" \u0027Yes, I know of the house,\u0027 he said, smiling agreeably. \u0027It\u0027s very beautiful. And my coming there was a macabre and romantic experience, which I wouldn\u0027t divulge to you in any detail, except that I must. It bears heavily upon your love for Mona. And so the light must shine in the dark.¡¯\n \" \u0027How so?\u0027 I was suddenly alarmed.\n \"The chocolate was now at the perfect temperature. We both drank it at the same time. He sighed with pleasure, and then he filled our cups again. It was, as Mona would have said, perfectly egregiously delicious. But where was Mona?\n \" \u0027Oh, please tell everything,\u0027 I said. \u0027What does it have to do with my love of Mona?\u0027 I found myself trying to calculate his age. Was he older than Pops had been? Surely he was younger than Aunt Queen.\n \" \u0027It was in the time of your great-great-great-grandfather Manfred,\u0027 said Oncle Julien. \u0027He and I belonged to a gambling club here in New Orleans. It was secretive and fashionable and we played hands of poker for bets that did not involve money so much as secret tasks to please the man who won. It was in this very house that we played, I well remember, and your ancestor Manfred had at home his son William, who was a very young bridegroom, and rather afraid of Blackwood Manor and all the responsibilities that it involved. Can you imagine such a thing?¡¯\n \" \u0027That he was intimidated? Yes,\u0027 I said, \u0027I can imagine it though I don\u0027t feel that way myself. I\u0027m the young master there now and I love it.¡¯\n \"He smiled gently. \u0027I believe you,\u0027 he said evenly. \u0027And I like you. I see travel in your future, great adventures, roaming the world.¡¯\n \" \u0027Not alone, however,\u0027 I was quick to answer.\n \" \u0027Well, on this night in question,\u0027 he went on, \u0027when the gambling club was meeting here, it was Manfred Blackwood who won the hand and it was of Julien Mayfair whom he asked for the task to be done.\n \" \u0027We rode out at once in his automobile to Blackwood Manor and there I saw your marvelous home in all its moonlit glory, the columns the color of magnolia blossoms -- one of those southern fantasies that nourish us perpetually in which northerners so seldom believe. Your great-great-great-grandfather Manfred took me inside and up the winding steps to an unoccupied bedroom and there he declared to me what I must do.\n \" \u0027He produced an artful Mardi Gras mask and a rich red velvet cloak lined in gold satin, and he said that, clothed in this apparel, I must deflower William\u0027s young bride, for William himself, who soon appeared, had been absolutely unable to do it, and both Manfred and William had seen such masked trickery in a recent opera in New Orleans and they felt it would work here.\n \" \u0027 \"But hasn\u0027t your wife seen the same opera with you?\" I asked William, for I too had seen it at the opera house in New Orleans only a week before. \"Yes,\" William responded. \"Which is all the more reason why she will go along.\"\n \" \u0027Alors. Never one to turn my back upon a virgin and having only respect and compassion for a young woman so far cheated of a gentle and loving wedding night, I donned the mask and the cloak and went about the enterprise, vowing that I should wring from the young woman tears of ecstasy or count myself a damned soul, and suffice it to say that I emerged from the bedroom some forty-five minutes later a victor on the Stairway to Heaven, having achieved my highest goals.\n \" \u0027Now from this union there came your great-grandfather Gravier. Do you follow my drift?¡¯\n \"I was stunned into perfect silence.\n \" \u0027Now, within a few months after the birth of Gravier,\u0027 Julien continued in the same affable and ostensively charming manner, \u0027William was able, at my suggestion, to commence his connubial duties by means of the mask and cape, and never was your great-great-grandmother ever the wiser as to the nature of the first encounter, and so on went their conjugal bliss, or so Manfred told me, the mild-mannered William very likely depending upon the mask and cape as long as fate required.\n \" \u0027Now in time the young woman in question went to her reward in heaven, as we say, and William took a second wife, only to discover that he could not deflower her any more than he\u0027d been able to deflower his first wife, and once again Manfred called upon me to don the mask and cloak, and so I did, becoming the father of the noble lady whom you call your Aunt Queen. Ah, such a blessed daughter --.\n \" \u0027But my point is you are related to me and to mine by blood.¡¯\n \"I was speechless.\n \"As I looked at him, as I sat there with the heat pumping in my cheeks, trying to fathom what he was saying to me, trying to evaluate what he was saying, some small voice inside said it was impossible, he couldn\u0027t be that old, he didn\u0027t look that old, the numbers weren\u0027t right for him to have been the father of Aunt Queen\u0027s older brother, Gravier, or of Aunt Queen herself, but maybe he was very young then, I didn\u0027t know.\n \"But far louder than any voice that troubled me about years or numbers was the voice that said, \u0027Both you and Mona see spirits, Tarquin, and you are hearing an explanation of how that tendency came about. Oncle Julien\u0027s blood gave you those genes, Tarquin. His blood gave you the receptors which Mona also enjoys.¡¯\n \"As for the desk in the parlor of Blackwood Manor, the one round which William\u0027s ghost appeared to hover, I intended to go home and tear it apart.\n \"Right then I sat there in total shock. I decided to drink the second cup of chocolate and I did. I grabbed for the pitcher and refilled my cup. Quietly he drank from his own.\n \" \u0027It\u0027s not been my purpose to wound you, Tarquin,\u0027 said Oncle Julien, his voice very soft with affection. \u0027Far from it. Your youth and your sincerity appeal to me. And I see this lovely bouquet of flowers which you\u0027ve brought to Mona, and this touches me that you want so desperately to love her.¡¯\n \" \u0027I do love her,\u0027 I said.\n \" \u0027But we are a dangerously inbred family, Tarquin. And you cannot be with Mona. Even if you were both of age, my blood in your veins rules it out. Over time I have come to see that my genes in my offspring tended to dominate, and this has sometimes caused grief. When I was. . . when I was thoughtless and free and rebellious, when I hated time and was desperate, I didn\u0027t care about such things, but I care very much about them now. You could say I exist in a Purgatorial state of concern about them. That\u0027s why I must warn you that you can\u0027t be with Mona. You must leave Mona to her ghosts and you must go home to yours.¡¯\n \" \u0027I won\u0027t do it, Julien,\u0027 I said. \u0027I want to respect you and I do respect you, even though you deceived my ancestor, this shivering virgin whom you seduced in the very bed in which I sleep now. But I have to hear rejection from Mona\u0027s own lips.¡¯\n \"He took a deep swallow of his hot chocolate and looked away thoughtfully as though it comforted him to see the maple tree and the willow and the huge strapping magnolia that promised to dominate the little glen.\n \" \u0027Tell me something, young one,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you pick up a strange fragrance in this yard?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, it\u0027s overpowering,\u0027 I said. \u0027I didn\u0027t want to ask about it. But I can smell it. It\u0027s sweet.¡¯\n \"There seemed a sudden change in his demeanor. He went from charming ease to fatality.\n \" \u0027Once again, I must say it, mon fils, that you must absolutely never be with Mona,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you will forgive me that I brought you to this spot.¡¯\n \" \u0027What do you mean? Why do you say that to me? Who\u0027s to say that we won\u0027t be faithful to each other until we\u0027re grown? Three years from now, can\u0027t she make up her mind for herself? I\u0027ll hold her to my heart, I\u0027ll wear her hair in my locket of her and when the time comes I\u0027ll walk with her down the aisle.¡¯\n \" \u0027No, that can never be. Please understand how much I love Mona and how much I respect you and know you to be of fine character. But you can see spirits, mon fils, and you can catch the scent of the dead. You know that buried here in this spot are mutations who should never have been born to this family. Take my confidence, mon fils, that if you marry Mona your children may be these mutations as well. That you can catch the scent is proof of it, I must confess.¡¯\n \" \u0027Are you telling me you killed and buried Mona\u0027s child here?\u0027 I demanded.\n \" \u0027No. Mona\u0027s child is living,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Its destiny is a different matter, I can well say. But there must be no more of such creatures, not by the name of Mayfair, and Mona will never have any other name.¡¯\n \" \u0027You\u0027re wrong!\u0027 I said.\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t despise me, Tarquin, for your own sake,\u0027 he said. He seemed endlessly patient. \u0027I thought if I explained things to you it would be easier. And maybe it will be in the course of time.¡¯\n \" \u0027Tarquin!\u0027 I heard my name called. I turned to my left. In the broad gateway by the pool it was Michael Curry there who had called out to me and beside him stood Rowan Mayfair, and both were looking at me as though I had done something wrong.\n \"I rose immediately.\n \"They came towards me. They were both in casual, at-home dress. And Michael had a build on him in his blue work shirt that made my mouth water.\n \"Rowan spoke first. She was kindly. \u0027What are you doing here, Tarquin?\u0027 she asked.\n \" \u0027Well, I\u0027m speaking to Julien,\u0027 I said. \u0027We were just having hot chocolate and visiting here.\u0027 I turned and gestured to the right but Julien wasn\u0027t there. I glanced at the table and then looked back to it. Except for my bouquet there was nothing there. No thermal silver pitcher, no cups, no animal crackers, nothing.\n \"The breath went out of me.\n \" \u0027My God,\u0027 I said. I made the Sign of the Cross. \u0027I tell you, I was speaking to him. I burnt my tongue on the second cup of hot chocolate. The pitcher, it was silver. He let me in at the front gate! He was telling me that I couldn\u0027t be with Mona, he said we were related. I . . .\u0027 I stopped. I sank down in the chair.\n \"Nobody knew better than me what had happened! Yet my eyes searched the garden for him. And again I stared at the empty table. I laid my hand on the bouquet. And where was Goblin? Why hadn\u0027t Goblin warned me? How impatient I\u0027d been with Goblin, and Goblin had let me fend for myself!\n \"Dr. Rowan Mayfair came behind me and put her hands on my shoulders. I felt soothed immediately by the way that she massaged me. She actually bent down and kissed my cheek. Rampant, comforting chills went through me. Oh, the pure sweetness of it. Michael Curry sat opposite and he took my hand and held it firmly. He was like the uncle I never knew.\n \"God, how I loved them. How I wanted to be connected to them. How I wanted to love Mona with their blessing. Desperately, I needed their comfort now.\n \" \u0027I\u0027m going to be locked up,\u0027 I stammered. \u0027Julien Mayfair. Was he ever a real man?¡¯\n \" \u0027He was real, all right,\u0027 said Rowan Mayfair in her patient and sincere husky voice. \u0027He\u0027s a legend in the Mayfair clan. He died in 1914.\u0027 \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-30.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
