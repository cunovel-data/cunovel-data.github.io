He told me simply that, young as I was, the sun could destroy me, and that even when I had attained a great age, such as he had, it would still render me powerless and unconscious. He told me also that fire could mean my death. But that no other injury could kill me.\\n\\n \"I felt, unwisely, no doubt, that I understood these things. He told me as well that all the wounds inflicted on me by Petronia in her rage would heal over the day\u0027s time, as they weren\u0027t very serious for one of my strength, and that he would come for me when the sun had set, and I should wait for him.\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid of the narrow box, my child,\u0027 he said. \u0027Make it your refuge. And don\u0027t be afraid of your dreams. You are an immortal now, and all your faculties are enhanced. Accept it and rejoice in it.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I lay down then in the crypt, and I did suffer the most unspeakable horror of it, but there was nothing to be done about it, the granite lid was closed over me, and very soon, weeping quietly, I lost consciousness.\\n\\n \"I dreamed a dream of Patsy. She smelled like cotton candy. Her lips tasted like candy apples. I dreamed I was a little child, and I sat on her lap, and she pushed me off, and I grew to be a man in a twinkling and I killed her. I drank her blood. It tasted like maple syrup. Her diseases and her meanness could not contaminate me. I tried to wake up. I dreamed this over and over and I woke once, or so I dreamed, with her body in my arms. A Barbie. I pushed her down into the green water of the swamp and as I watched her sink below the surface I felt horror. But she was gone and dead, and blood came up. It was too late to save her. Bye Patsy. Rebecca laughed. A death for my death. \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 I scoffed, \u0027you think you planned everything.\u0027 \u0027The Damnation of Quinn,\u0027 said Fr. Kevin.\\n\\n \"When I opened my eyes the next time Arion was there looking down at me. The sun had only just set and the sky was still red and the golden light filled the crypt, and he was pleased to see that I was conscious. He led me up the stairs and to the terrace.\\n\\n \"The stars drifted in the purple sky. The gold hung behind the clouds. It was magnificent.\\n\\n \" \u0027Some Blood Hunters don\u0027t wake till the sky is full dark,\u0027 he said, \u0027and they never know this quiet glory. I see you shade your eyes, but it doesn\u0027t hurt you.¡¯\\n\\n \"In fact it didn\u0027t and it was only with difficulty that I absorbed the reality that I would never see \u0027the light of day\u0027 again.\\n\\n \"He saw the trouble in my face. He said, \u0027Look back on nothing. I\u0027ll take you out to hunt now. You\u0027re my apprentice for the evening.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And so I\u0027ve disappointed her,\u0027 I asked, \u0027and she\u0027ll have nothing further to do with me?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027No,\u0027 he said with a short honest laugh. \u0027She\u0027s eager to see you. But it happens that she\u0027s a miserable teacher. And so I\u0027ve told her no, and that I\u0027ll take you out, and so we\u0027ll hunt the caf¨¦s and the clubs of Napoli.¡¯\\n\\n \"He was dressed informally tonight in a black silk shirt open at the neck and a finely cut jacket of dark red silk and a pair of sleek trousers.\\n\\n \"He took me to a room where the young mortal boy waited to help me select a similar suit of clothes, which I did hastily. Once again, I thanked him for his kindness.\\n\\n \" \u0027If I had any money,\u0027 I said, \u0027I\u0027d give it to you.¡¯\\n\\n \"He smiled at me. And I patted his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Then we were off to the caf¨¦s and bars for more lessons.\\n\\n \"We moved through all manner of crowds, taking the Little Drink over and over until I was very skilled at it, and then, cornering for ourselves two \u0027perfect killers,\u0027 we had our fill of them in a back alley in the oldest part of Naples. We left their bodies because Arion said it didn\u0027t matter there, but there would be other times when it did and the bodies had to be disposed of. As it was, he slashed the throats of the two so it would seem they had bled to death.\\n\\n \" \u0027To thrive without killing,\u0027 he said, \u0027that is everything. If you can live without bringing death, you will endure. But now and then the urge to kill will overrule -- you\u0027ll want the burning bitter heart -- and so I\u0027ve taught you how to do it.¡¯\\n\\n \"I was exhilarated all this while, and the elegant figure of Arion constantly thrilled me. I imitated his grace. I wanted him for my model in everything. And in some ways he is my model to this very moment. He had a feline way of moving and speaking in a hushed tone that commanded respect and loyalty of me.\\n\\n \"His skin was so black that under the lights of the caf¨¦s and bars it had a bluish tinge to it, and his deep yellow eyes had tiny flecks of brown and green in them. His teeth were powerfully white, and his lips small for his face, and his smile very smooth and loving.\\n\\n \"Finally, after we had hunted perhaps more than was required, we settled in a somewhat quiet caf¨¦ where he could talk to me and educate me, and this thrilled me almost as much as our hunting.\\n\\n \"But as soon as the stillness settled over me, as soon as I had the coffee in my hands, which I couldn\u0027t and didn\u0027t want to drink, I found myself in a state of shock and I began to shiver violently.\\n\\n \"He reached over and laid his hand on mine, and then, kissing his fingers, he repeated the gesture. Then he drew back.\\n\\n \" \u0027Understand the gift you\u0027ve been given, as best you can,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t forswear it in the first years. Too many perish in that way. Of course you despise Petronia for giving it to you -- all this is natural and right. When she drained you, when she almost killed you, you saw a vision of those who\u0027d gone to Paradise before you. And you turned away.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027How did you know?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027I could read your mind then. It\u0027s not the same now. We\u0027ve exchanged too much blood. It\u0027s the same with her too. Don\u0027t let her fool you. She\u0027s mercilessly clever and eternally whimsical and persistently unhappy. But for whatever it\u0027s worth, she loves you and she can\u0027t read your mind any longer.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Is she always a woman for you? Do you ever see her as a man?¡¯\\n\\n \"He laughed. \u0027She made her choice in life early on to be the woman with me. When she fought in the arena centuries ago, it was as a woman. Those who came up against her marveled at her musculature and her stamina. But they thought her a woman. She switches back and forth. She\u0027s truly both. But we don\u0027t need to talk of her now. Let\u0027s talk of you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And what is there to say about me?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Did I will myself into this? I did not. And yet I blame myself that it happened. I turned away from my grandparents in that vision of Paradise, you\u0027re right, and can you tell me now, even if the answer torments me -- was what I saw real?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I can\u0027t tell you,\u0027 he said with an easy graceful shrug. \u0027I don\u0027t know. I only know what you saw. It\u0027s the same with my victims. Often they see the light of Paradise and those they once loved call to them, and so they leave my embrace, in spirit, and I am left with the corpse.¡¯\\n\\n \"That answer rattled me. And I sat quietly for a long moment. I even picked up the cup of coffee and then set it down. The caf¨¦ was half empty. The street outside was noisy with passersby. There was a nightclub opposite. The music was throbbing beyond the neon sign. I wondered if I had been in this street when I was alive. I didn\u0027t remember it. But Nash and I had gone a-wandering in Naples. It was possible. And now, how would I see Nash again? How would I even go home?\\n\\n \" \u0027Now let me take up the point again,\u0027 said Arion. \u0027Don\u0027t be destroyed in the first years. It happens with too many. There\u0027s so much danger all around you. It\u0027s easy to despair. It\u0027s easy to succumb to bitter hatred of yourself. It\u0027s easy to feel that the world no longer belongs to you, when nothing is further from the truth. It\u0027s all yours and the passage of the years is yours. And now you must simply and plainly live up to it.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027How long do we have?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \"He was surprised by the question. \u0027Forever,\u0027 he said with another shrug. \u0027There is no lifetime for us. When I gave you my blood I tried to hide my life from you, but you saw the place of my mortal happiness. You knew it was Athens. You knew the Acropolis. You recognized it immediately. You saw the Temple of Athena in all its grandeur. I couldn\u0027t keep from you the secret of the sheer brilliance of that time, and the Athenian sunshine, so harsh, so hot, so merciless and wonderful. You breathed this knowledge from me. And you must certainly know how long I have been alive, how long I\u0027ve walked the Earth as we say, how many centuries I\u0027ve wandered.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027What sustains you? What supports you? Surely not Petronia and the Old Man.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t be so quick to judge,\u0027 he said gently. \u0027Some night far distant from now -- if you survive -- you\u0027ll laugh when you remember asking me such a question. Besides, I love Petronia, and I can control her. You wonder perhaps why I didn\u0027t stop her from making you, as we call it, why I didn\u0027t call upon my authority to stop her from defiling you? Because you must understand I saw her as giving you immortality.¡¯\\n\\n \"He paused, smiling at me faintly and touching my hand again with his hand, which was warm.\\n\\n \" \u0027Were there other reasons? I don\u0027t honestly know,\u0027 he went on. \u0027Perhaps I harbored a heated desire to see you transformed. You are so very admirable. So young. So splendid in all your parts. And with the sole exception of Manfred, it\u0027s been centuries since she worked the Dark Trick, as some of us call it. Centuries. And she has an idea that the desire builds in us and then must be discharged, and so she brings someone into our midst and makes of that one a Blood Hunter.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But the girls who prepared me, and the boy -- they spoke as if there had been others.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027She plays with others, and then she destroys them. The servants? What do they know? They\u0027re told that the postulant is being prepared for great gifts, and then fails. That\u0027s all. Now the girl, I don\u0027t know about her. She\u0027s ignorant and greedy. But there is some spark in the boy. Perhaps Petronia will bring him to us.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And has it been well done?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, yes, of course it\u0027s been well done,\u0027 he said, almost as if I\u0027d insulted him with my question, \u0027not without much more cursing and kicking I think than was ever necessary, but in the main well done; I saw to it that it was well done, though I have more to tell you.¡¯\\n\\n \"He made a little gesture with the coffee, playing with it, as though he liked to see it move in the cup and savor the aroma of it, which was dark and thick and alien to me. Then he spoke.\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m watching you, of course,\u0027 he said. \u0027When you drink from the evil ones you have to revel in it, not cringe from the evil. It\u0027s your chance to be evil as the one you kill. Follow your victim\u0027s evil as you empty his soul. Make it your adventure into crimes you yourself would never wantonly commit. When you\u0027ve finished, you take your soul back with what you\u0027ve learned and you\u0027re clean again.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I feel anything but clean,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \" \u0027Then feel powerful,\u0027 he said. \u0027Disease can\u0027t touch you. Neither can age. Any wound you receive will heal. Cut your hair and it will grow back within the space of a night. Forever you will look just as you are now, my Caravaggio Christ. Remember, only fire and the sun can harm you.¡¯\\n\\n \"I listened intently as he continued.\\n\\n \" \u0027Fire you must avoid at all costs,\u0027 he said, \u0027for your blood will burn, and terrible suffering may result, which you may survive, healing slowly over centuries. As for the sun -- one day of it cannot kill me. But in these early years, either can destroy you. Don\u0027t yield to the desire for death. It claims too many of the young in their impetuosity and grand emotions.¡¯\\n\\n \"I smiled. I knew what he meant -- grand emotions.\\n\\n \" \u0027You needn\u0027t find a crypt every day of your life,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027re strong from me and Petronia combined, and even the Old Man\u0027s blood has been good for you. A room that is shut up and sealed away from the sun, a hiding place, that will suffice, but eventually you should choose a refuge to which you can retire, a place that is yours where no one can find you. Remember when you do this that you are some ten times stronger than mortals now.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Ten times,\u0027 I marveled.\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027When you took the pretty bride you broke her neck in the final moments. You weren\u0027t even conscious of it. It was the same with the killer in the alley. You snapped his spine. You have to learn to be careful.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m drenched with murder,\u0027 I said. I looked at my hands. I knew I would never see Mona again, because I knew that a witch like Mona would see blood all over them.\\n\\n \" \u0027You feed from mortals now,\u0027 said Arion in his usual graceful manner. \u0027It\u0027s your nature. Blood Hunters have existed since the beginning of time, and probably before that. Old myths are told and written that we once had among us parents from whom the primal fount poured forth to us all, and that whatever happened to them happened to us and so they must be kept forever inviolate. But I\u0027ll give you the books to read which tell these tales. . .¡¯\\n\\n \"He paused, looking around the caf¨¦. I wondered what he saw. I saw blood in every face. I heard blood in every voice. At will I could receive the thoughts of any mind like so much static. He went on.\\n\\n \" \u0027Suffice it to say that the Mother rose from her slumber of thousands of years and on a rampage destroyed many of her children. It was at random that she moved. And I thank the gods that she passed over us. I could have done nothing against her power, because she had the Mind Gift -- that is, to destroy by will -- and the Fire Gift -- that is, to burn by will -- and she burnt those Blood Hunters whom she found, and they numbered in the hundreds.\\n\\n \" \u0027At last she herself was destroyed, and the sacred nucleus -- the primal blood from which we all come -- was passed into another, otherwise we would all have withered as so many flowers upon a dead vine. But that root has been preserved without interruption.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027This one, this one who has the nucleus or the root, is he very old?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027It\u0027s a woman,\u0027 he replied, \u0027and she is ancient, as old as the Mother was, and she has no desire to rule, only to keep the root safe and to live as a witness to time, in a place apart from the world and its worries. With that kind of age comes a peace from the blood. She no longer needs to drink it.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027When will that peace come for me?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \"He laughed softly, gently. \u0027Not for thousands of years,\u0027 he said. \u0027Though with the blood I gave you, you can go many nights with just the Little Drink or even nothing. You\u0027ll suffer but you won\u0027t become weak unto dying. That\u0027s the trick, remember. Don\u0027t become so weak that you can\u0027t hunt. That you must never do. Promise me.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027It matters to you what happens to me?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Of course,\u0027 he said. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be with you here if it didn\u0027t. I gave you my blood, did I not?\u0027 He laughed but it was kindly. \u0027You don\u0027t know what a gift it was, my blood. I\u0027ve lived for so long. In the parlance of our kind, I\u0027m a Child of the Millennia, and my blood is considered too strong for the young and unwise, but I hold you to be wise and so I gave it. Live up to it.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027What do you expect of me now? I know that I\u0027m to kill those who are evil and no others, yes, and the Little Drink must be done with stealth and grace, but what else do you expect?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Nothing, really,\u0027 he said. \u0027You go where you wish to go and do what you wish to do. What will sustain you, how you will live, these are things you must figure out for yourself.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, you ask me to go back so many years,\u0027 he said. \u0027My Master and my Maker were one, a great writer of the Greek tragedy just before and during the time of Aeschylus. He had been something of a roamer before he set to work in Athens writing for the theater, and he had traveled into India, where he bought me from a man I scarcely remember who kept me for his bed, and had educated me for his library, and who sold me for a dear price to the Athenian who brought me home to Athens to copy for him and be his bed slave. I loved it. The world of the stage delighted me. We worked hard on the scenery, the training of the chorus and of the solitary actor whom Thespis had introduced into the mix of the early theater as it was then.\\n\\n \" \u0027My Master wrote scores of plays -- satires, comedies, tragedies. He wrote odes to celebrate victorious athletes. He wrote long epic poems. He wrote lyrics for his own pleasure. He was always waking me in the middle of the night to copy or merely to listen. \"Wake up, Arion, wake up, you won\u0027t believe what I\u0027ve done here!\" he would say, shaking me and shoving a cup of water into my hands. You know that meter and rhythm were much more important to the Greeks back then. He was the past master of it all. He made me laugh with his pure cleverness.\\n\\n \" \u0027He wrote for every festival, every contest, every conceivable excuse, and was ever busy on every detail of the performance down to the procession that might precede it or the painting of the masks to be used. It was his life. That is, when we weren\u0027t traveling.\\n\\n \" \u0027It was his joy to go to other Greek colonies and there participate in the theater as well, and it was here in Italy that he encountered the sorceress who gave him the Power. We were living then in the Etruscan city that would later become Pompeii, and he had been involved in putting on a theatrical in the festival of Dionysus for the Greeks.\\n\\n \" \u0027I can still remember the night he came back to me, and how at first he would have nothing to do with me, and then he brought me into his presence and clumsily he drank from me, and when it seemed that I would die, when I was sure of it, he gave me the Blood in a blundering terrible moment, weeping and desperate and pleading with me to understand that he didn\u0027t know what had happened to him.\\n\\n \" \u0027We were neophytes together. We were Children in the Blood together. He burnt his plays, all of them. He said that all he had written was worthless. He was no more among humankind. To the end of his existence he sought sorcerers and witches to try to find some way to cure the Evil Blood in himself. And he perished before my very eyes, immolating himself when scarcely twenty-five years had passed. He left me a hardened orphan.\\n\\n \" \u0027But I have always been a resourceful soul, and, never wanting death, have not been tempted by it. I saw Greece fall to Rome. I saw my Master\u0027s plays in the bookshops and the marketplaces for a very long time -- centuries. I saw my Master\u0027s personal poetry read and studied by young Roman boys, and then I saw the rise of Christianity and the loss of thousands of works -- poetry, the drama, yes, even plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides lost -- history, letters -- and with them the loss of my Master\u0027s name, and the salvage of a precious few from those days when I had known so many.\\n\\n \" \u0027I am content. I am resourceful still. I deal in diamonds and pearls. I use the Mind Gift to make me rich. I cheat no one. I am clever beyond what I need. And I keep Petronia always with me. I love the company of Manfred. He and I play chess and cards and we talk and we roam the streets of Naples together. I remember so vividly the night that she brought him here, cursing that she had had to keep a bargain.\\n\\n \" \u0027They had met here in Naples, she and he, and she had taken a fancy to visiting the swamps where he lived, and having there a hideaway. It had seemed to her an appropriate wilderness from which she could hunt the drifters and the drinkers and gamblers of New Orleans and all the Southland. And eventually, he built her a domicile and a fancy tomb such as she desired, and she loved to retreat to that place whenever she was angry with me, or whenever she wanted what was new and raw, and would be away from Italy, where everything had been done a hundred times over.\\n\\n \" \u0027But in time she\u0027d come to promise Manfred that she would give him the Blood, because she had told him what she was, and at last she had had to keep her word, or so I told her, and do it she did, and brought him here, so that those he loved would think he had died in the swampland.\\n\\n \" \u0027Now it will be the same with you. They will imagine that you died in the swamp. Is that not so?¡¯\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t answer him.\\n\\n \"Then I said:\\n\\n \" \u0027Thank you for all you told to me, and for all you\u0027ve taught me. I\u0027m humble in your presence. I\u0027d be a fool if I claimed to fully understand your age, the value of your perspective, your patience. I can only offer gratitude. May I put one more question to you?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Of course you may. Put any question.\u0027 He smiled.\\n\\n \" \u0027You\u0027ve lived over two thousand years, perhaps closer to three,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \"He paused, then he nodded.\\n\\n \" \u0027What have you given back to the world on account of this?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \"He stared at me. His face became thoughtful but it remained warm and cordial. And then he said gently, \u0027Nothing.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Why?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027What should I give?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said. \u0027I feel as though I\u0027m going mad. I feel as though if I\u0027m to live forever I have to give something back.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But we\u0027re not part of it, don\u0027t you see?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said with a gasp. \u0027I see only too clearly.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t torment yourself. Think on this matter for a while. Think. You have time, all the time in the world.¡¯\\n\\n \"I was near to weeping. But I swallowed it back down.\\n\\n \" \u0027Let me ask you,\u0027 he said. \u0027When you were alive, did you feel you had to give back something for life?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \u0027I did.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I see. And so you are like my old Master with his poetry. But you mustn\u0027t follow his example! Imagine it, Quinn, what I have seen. And there are small things to do. There are loving things.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You think so?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027I know so,\u0027 he said. \u0027But come, let\u0027s go back to the palazzo. I know Petronia is waiting for you.¡¯\\n\\n \"I laughed a short ironic little laugh. \u0027That\u0027s comforting,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \"As we stood to leave the caf¨¦ I stopped and looked at myself intently in the mirrored wall. I looked human enough even to my enhanced vision. And no one in the caf¨¦ had so much as stared at us, except for an occasional pair of pretty girls who had come and gone after their espresso. Human enough. Yes. I was pleased with it. I was magnificently pleased with it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-41.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \\n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
