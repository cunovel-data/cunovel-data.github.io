They showed me the shadowy double parlor with its carved archway and shining floors and they took me through the handsome dining room with its murals of Riverbend Plantation, long ago sacrificed to the curvature of the Mississippi River as it changed its fickle path.\n \"Rowan was the tour guide, pointing out details with a low-key simplicity, her voice warm, though her gray eyes were always cold. She was very shapely in her white shirt and pants and seemed at times to be ruminating in a dream.\n \"Then it was in the sunlit kitchen that we settled at a glass table with brass dolphins as a base to it, and we were ranged in comfortable brushed-steel chairs. There was a cozy back stairs in the corner and a small gas fireplace for cold days, but this wasn\u0027t one of them, and beyond the French doors we could see the rampant jasmine and the banana trees that grew around the wall of the rear garden where I had sat with Julien, so oblivious to the real world.\n \" \u0027But how do I know you\u0027re real?\u0027 I asked them logically. \u0027He seemed in those moments as real as anybody, except --.\u0027 And then I had to admit it, the things that were wrong, that he had been a friend to my ancestor Manfred, a sheer impossibility in terms of his appearance, and then there was the matter of his old-fashioned nineteenth-century clothes.\n \" \u0027Ghosts tip you off and then distract you,\u0027 I confessed.\n \"Michael Curry nodded his head. I knew instinctively that he had seen spirits, plenty of them. And he was such a genial man, almost humble. Yet he gave an impression of incredible strength. He had exceptionally large hands and they looked gentle.\n \" \u0027What did he tell you, son?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Can you share this information with us?¡¯\n \" \u0027That he had sired my great-great-grandfather,\u0027 I said. I proceeded to recount for them the operatic drama and how it had been done. And that it seemed to mean that Mona and I both carried a sensitivity to see spirits and that was why we mustn\u0027t marry on any account.\n \"It may have been utterly self-defeating to repeat these things to Michael and Rowan but I had no intention of holding them back. I thought they should know everything. They should know why Oncle Julien had interfered.\n \"With my eyes opened now I told them of Oncle Julien\u0027s words, that he existed in a \u0027Purgatorial state of concern\u0027 about his genes dominating his offspring, and how he had asked me about the sweet scent in the backyard, and of how I could smell that scent and had not wanted to say anything until asked.\n \"Both Rowan and Michael seemed fascinated by these confessions, and I went on to tell them that Oncle Julien had said that mutations were buried in the earth of the rear garden, but not Mona\u0027s child, Mona\u0027s mutated child was living, and this seemed to enthrall them and they asked that I repeat it and I did.\n \"At this point I became so miserable, so certain that they would not let me see Mona, and so sure of failure in every regard that I began to cry. I begged them not to turn me away. I told them how much I wanted to be part of them. I had no shame in it. And perhaps in my own heart I felt I was worthy somehow.\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t come as a pauper,\u0027 I said. \u0027I don\u0027t come as a beggar. I don\u0027t offer Mona a small cottage in which to live.¡¯\n \" \u0027We know that, son,\u0027 said Michael Curry. \u0027And forgive us if we seemed lacking in respect when we came to Blackwood Manor, but Mona has put us through some wild escapades and at times we forget our manners. Yesterday was one of those times. Believe me when I say we worry about Mona.¡¯\n \" \u0027But what is so very wrong with Mona being with me? Do you believe it\u0027s that we both see spirits?¡¯\n \" \u0027No, it\u0027s not that in itself,\u0027 said Michael. He sat back comfortably in his chair as he addressed me. \u0027The fact is, there are medical reasons, good medical reasons that have to do with Mona\u0027s health.¡¯\n \" \u0027It\u0027s Mona who has the right to talk about the medical aspects of things,\u0027 Rowan said in her softly running husky voice, \u0027not us. But we can tell you that Mona isn\u0027t acting wisely and we are trying to guard Mona from herself.\u0027 She was soft and sincere.\n \"I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. \u0027I understand your problem,\u0027 I replied, \u0027because I can\u0027t divulge the things that Mona has said to me. But can\u0027t I see her? Can\u0027t you let her come down? Can\u0027t I tell her about the ghost of Oncle Julien? Can\u0027t I ask her what she has to say?¡¯\n \" \u0027You do understand,\u0027 said Michael, \u0027that this was a powerful apparition. This ghost chose to intervene in a powerful way. Have you ever seen a ghost like this?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said, \u0027I have seen ghosts that strong.¡¯\n \"I told them both the whole story of Rebecca. And as I did so I knew I was being my own worst enemy again. But there could be nothing under this roof but frankness, or so it seemed to me. My love for them ordained that frankness.\n \"I also told them about Goblin. As much as I thought right.\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t you see that I belong with her?\u0027 I said finally. \u0027She\u0027s the only one who will ever understand me, and I\u0027m the only one who\u0027ll ever understand her?¡¯\n \" \u0027Son, you have your own ghosts,\u0027 said Michael, \u0027and she has hers. You have to move away from each other. You have to seek a decent normality on your own.¡¯\n \" \u0027Oh, God, that\u0027s impossible!\u0027 I said. \u0027We\u0027ll never achieve it. Besides, who\u0027s to say we can\u0027t achieve it better together if it\u0027s achievable at all?¡¯\n \"I could see now they were pondering my words. I had made some incidental impression of intelligence on them if nothing else. They hadn\u0027t kicked me out of their house yet in any event, and now an overpowering urge to have hot chocolate came over me, a stupid, insidious desire to drink hot chocolate in large amounts.\n \"And to my utter amazement, Michael rose and said, \u0027I\u0027ll fix it for you. I\u0027d like some myself.\u0027 I was stunned. They were a family of mind readers on top of everything else. I heard him laugh under his breath as he went to the pantry. Then came the noises and the deep delicious fragrance of the heated milk.\n \"Rowan sat there solemnly and pondering, and then, very softly, she spoke. Her voice as usual was much gentler than her angular face, with its high cheekbones and blunt-cut wavy hair.\n \" \u0027Tarquin, let me lay it out,\u0027 she said. \u0027Let me violate Mona\u0027s confidentiality. Let me make that judgment call. Mona has given me permission to do it, to tell you things about her, which really shouldn\u0027t be told. She isn\u0027t really old enough to give that permission. But let me go on. Mona endangers herself every time she has intimate relations with a man. Do you follow me? She runs the risk of hurting herself severely. We\u0027re trying to keep Mona alive.¡¯\n \" \u0027But we used protection, Dr. Mayfair,\u0027 I insisted. Nevertheless this was frightening news. I had dried my eyes by this time and was trying to behave like an adult.\n \" \u0027Of course you did,\u0027 said Dr. Mayfair, raising her eyebrows slightly, \u0027but even the best of precautions can fail. There\u0027s always the possibility that Mona will conceive. And just the smallest miscarriage weakens Mona in ways that a normal woman does not have to worry about. It\u0027s all because of the baby born to Mona, the baby whom Oncle Julien mentioned to you in the garden outside. It left Mona vulnerable. And we\u0027re trying to keep Mona alive. We\u0027re trying to discover how to fix what\u0027s wrong so Mona won\u0027t be so vulnerable, but for that we need time.¡¯\n \" \u0027Dear God,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027That\u0027s why Mona was at Mayfair Medical the day I saw her.¡¯\n \" \u0027Precisely,\u0027 said Rowan. She was becoming a little more heated, but she sounded compassionate at the same time. \u0027We\u0027re not insensitive monsters,\u0027 she said. \u0027Really we\u0027re not. We\u0027re trying to get her to stop seducing her cousins and to cooperate with our regimen of blood tests and nutritional supplements so we can find out what\u0027s going wrong inside of her and why she so often conceives. Now, I\u0027ve told you more than I should, and by the way, let me add that she is in love with you and she\u0027s stopped roaming since she met you; you have every right to know that, but we can\u0027t countenance her being with you.¡¯\n \" \u0027No,\u0027 I said, \u0027what you can\u0027t countenance is her being alone with me. Let me see her here with you present. Let me see her with a vow of celibacy. What could be wrong with that?¡¯\n \"Michael came to the table with the very silver pitcher I had seen in the garden and cups for us all. It was the same damned china. The hot chocolate was as rich and delicious as it had been in the vision and I was ready for a second cup almost at once. I wanted to tell them about the pitcher and the china, but I wanted even more to talk about Mona.\n \" \u0027Thank you for humoring me on this score -- I mean with this chocolate,\u0027 I said. \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter with me.¡¯\n \"Michael refilled my cup for the second time. I drank deeply. It tasted better than anything known to man.\n \"I sat back. \u0027I\u0027ve been level with you,\u0027 I said. \u0027Can\u0027t you be level with me? Tell her that I\u0027m here --.¡¯\n \" \u0027She knows that, Quinn,\u0027 said Michael. \u0027Her powers of clairvoyance are tremendous. She knew it when you came through the front gate. She\u0027s wrestling with the very things Rowan confided to you. The truth\u0027s coming full force on her. She\u0027s sick. And then there\u0027s the question of her lost offspring -- the one that Julien told you was alive. She heard that news when you did, and she was the one who came to us and told us to come down and welcome you in.¡¯\n \"I wanted to say this was a great consolation, which it was, but I wished they had told me before this time and I didn\u0027t want to complain. Also something else occurred to me. Why had they interrupted my conversation with Julien when they did? If they hadn\u0027t come, how much more would Julien have said?\n \" \u0027That\u0027s a question to which we don\u0027t have an answer,\u0027 said Michael, having read my thoughts again.\n \" \u0027But you stopped him. You stopped him from revealing family secrets,\u0027 I said. \u0027You thought it best.¡¯\n \" \u0027We did,\u0027 said Dr. Mayfair. \u0027We thought it best.¡¯\n \" \u0027Does it matter to you that I am one of you?\u0027 I asked in a sober voice.\n \"Neither of them had an answer for me. Then Rowan spoke in the most dejected manner. \u0027If only Mona wasn\u0027t ill,\u0027 she said. \u0027If only we could find a cure. Then everything would be different, Quinn. As it stands now, what is the point of asking you to cast your lot with us? What is the point of asking you to be genetically tested as all of us are? What is the point of you taking on the weight of our history and our curses and all we suffer and know?¡¯\n \" \u0027Genetic testing?\u0027 I asked. \u0027To see if I have a susceptibility to see spirits?\u0027 I drank down the hot chocolate. Michael poured me another cup.\n \" \u0027No,\u0027 said Rowan, \u0027to see if you could produce the mutation in your offspring as Mona did.¡¯\n \" \u0027I want it,\u0027 I said.\n \"She nodded. \u0027All right. I\u0027ll set it up at Mayfair Medical. You report in to Dr. Winn Mayfair. Call his secretary to arrange the time.¡¯\n \" \u0027And now, where are you keeping my darling princess?¡¯\n \"I heard her from the top of the back stairs: \u0027Quinn!¡¯\n \"I rose at once and ran up to her, jogging left then left again with the little stairway, and then throwing my arms around her as we came together on the second floor.\n \" \u0027Remember my warnings,\u0027 came Rowan\u0027s voice from below.\n \" \u0027I promise, no penetration,\u0027 said Mona. \u0027Now leave us alone.¡¯\n \"I picked her up off her feet.\n \" \u0027Oh, my egregious boy!\u0027 she declared, her breasts hot beneath her snow white shirt, her red hair everywhere in my eyes and against my heart, her naked legs smooth and beautiful to my touch.\n \"I carried her down the hallway. \u0027Where do we go, Princess Mona of Mayfair?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I have wrestled with angels and dragons to be with you!¡¯\n \" \u0027To the very front of the house, Prince Tarquin of Blackwood,\u0027 she answered. \u0027There is my bower among the branches of the oaks.¡¯\n \"We passed up a short few steps, out of a narrow hallway, to a big bedroom and through it into a large hallway and on past a regal staircase to the very front where my beloved, my red-haired beloved, signaled me to make a left turn.\n \"It was the very front bedroom, all right, and its two floor-length windows were open to the upper porch, and they seemed to be filled by the oak branches of the two trees which stood before the house.\n \"We fell onto the bed.\n \"I was all wound up with Mona\u0027s virginal white blouse and its voluminous sleeves and lace, and we were tumbling in her white pillows, and I pressed my hand against her hot wet panties, and with the pressure of my palm brought her to the finish with divine blushes that made me come.\n \"Again we did it, and this time more slowly and playfully, and then again, and I was as always spent before she was, but I was in no mood to desert her in her need.\n \"It must have been an hour that we lay together, and all the while the door was partially open and there came no sound of any intruding person in the house.\n \"We were on our honor and on a small white lace baby quilt, which I had pretty much spoilt with my overspilled love. \u0027Entirely washable, and destined for the purpose,\u0027 said my Lady Love as she folded it and cast it away.\n \"Now it was the season for kisses and for snuggling and for lying back against the pillows and looking out of the windows at the oak branches in which the lithe little brown squirrels tripped among the clinging green ferns.\n \" \u0027I never want to leave you,\u0027 I told her. \u0027But awful things have happened to me since we were together,\u0027 I confessed.\n \"I told her all about the stranger and his bizarre assault. I told her how he had read my very thoughts about the Hermitage. And how I had given the order for the renovations and he and I would be partners in it, but I was more sure than ever that I had seen him dumping bodies by the light of the moon.\n \"She was fascinated.\n \" \u0027Doesn\u0027t that scare you?\u0027 she asked.\n \" \u0027Of course not,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m more scared of Oncle Julien.¡¯\n \"She laughed.\n \" \u0027Does Oncle Julien come any time you want him?¡¯\n \"She looked sad.\n \" \u0027No,\u0027 she said, \u0027it\u0027s more like he comes when he wants to come, and now you have to tell me everything that happened to you with him. I overheard your telling Rowan and Michael, I admit. I was an eavesdropper. But you have to tell me. Describe him. Describe how he acted. I have to know. I\u0027m so ferociously jealous when Oncle Julien appears to anybody else.¡¯\n \"I recounted the whole experience for her. I described Julien\u0027s dapper clothes, his gentle manner. I described the flowered china pattern. She knew it. She said it was Royal Antoinette. She wasn\u0027t sure they even had it in his time. She said he had snatched the image out of the pantry. He was a clever ghost.\n \"She was deeply affected by the fact that he had said her child was alive. That meant the world to her. I had a jewel there to give her in that simple intelligence.\n \" \u0027But doesn\u0027t a ghost ever lie?\u0027 I asked. I went, in my mind, back over my experience with Rebecca. Perhaps she never lied to me. She only deceived me and there can be a difference.\n \"I got up out of the bed. I went to the window and looked into the oak branches. It was so beautiful here. You\u0027d never guess that you were in the middle of the city -- that the waterfront lay a scant eight blocks from here to the left, that St. Charles Avenue with its legendary streetcars was only three blocks to the right.\n \" \u0027You know what I think?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027What is it?\u0027 she said, sitting up. She pulled her knees up and wrapped her arms around her legs. Her hands looked beautiful in her big laced ruffles. Her hair fell down around her shoulders in a way I\u0027ll never forget.\n \" \u0027I think I need you much more than you need me,\u0027 I said.\n \" \u0027Quinn, that\u0027s not true,\u0027 she said. \u0027I love you. You\u0027re the first person I\u0027ve ever fallen in love with. It came on me all last night after they brought me home. It hurts and it\u0027s splendid and it\u0027s real. I need you because you\u0027re fresh and vital and you\u0027re not part of us.¡¯\n \"She sounded so earnest.\n \" \u0027But I am,\u0027 I protested. \u0027I told you what Julien told me. He took the place of my great-great-grandfather William, I told you.¡¯\n \" \u0027But you weren\u0027t brought up a Mayfair,\u0027 she said. \u0027And you come with a strong name and tradition of your own. You live in a manor house with its own legends and grandeur! Besides, what does it matter? I need you and I love you, that\u0027s the point.¡¯\n \" \u0027Mona, was it true what Dr. Rowan told me, that every time. . .?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, it\u0027s true. They don\u0027t know why. But I\u0027m constantly ovulating, constantly fertile; I conceive constantly and I lose the offspring, and every time it happens I\u0027m weakened. More calcium is pulled out of my bones. Now, it is extremely possible -- totally possible actually -- that if they performed a hysterectomy on me, the problem would be solved, but then I\u0027d never have children, and they\u0027re hoping that somehow they can solve the problem without that step.¡¯\n \"I was frightened by all this, frightened for her. That I had unknowingly hurt her terrified me.\n \" \u0027If it means your life, Mona, you have to let them do the hysterectomy,\u0027 I said. \u0027You can\u0027t keep risking your very life.¡¯\n \" \u0027I know, Quinn, I think about it constantly,\u0027 she said. \u0027And so does everyone else. There will come a moment when they say that it\u0027s time to do it, and that time may be very soon. Think about that, Quinn. Does the Lord of Blackwood Manor want a bride that can never have a child?¡¯\n \" \u0027I love you, Mona. I don\u0027t need children. In fact, I know of a child we can have.¡¯\n \" \u0027Just have?\u0027 she said, laughing. \u0027You mean just like that?¡¯\n \"I told her about Pops, about Terry Sue and Tommy. Brilliant little Tommy sitting on the log with the book of paintings in his hand, and the black-and-blue mark on his face.\n \" \u0027Wow, think of it!\u0027 she said. \u0027It would be like Cinderella! You could just change his entire life!¡¯\n \" \u0027Yep. I intend to do that, no matter what happens. So don\u0027t think about me anymore when you think about this hysterectomy. I\u0027m pretty sure that Terry Sue is open to bargaining where Tommy\u0027s ownership is concerned. I\u0027m going to help Terry Sue with the whole passel of them, that\u0027s a done deal. But there\u0027s one thing I have to ask you.¡¯\n \" \u0027You already sound like the man of the house,\u0027 she said matter-of-factly. \u0027I\u0027ll do my best.¡¯\n \" \u0027No, I\u0027m serious, Mona.¡¯\n \"I sat on the bed next to her and I kissed her.\n \" \u0027Do Rowan and Michael know where your child is?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027No,\u0027 she said, \u0027I don\u0027t think that they do. Sometimes I think that they might -- Mayfair Medical is a world unto itself -- but no, they couldn\u0027t --. I can\u0027t stand that idea. I can\u0027t stand that they wouldn\u0027t tell me. But let\u0027s not talk about it, Quinn. Rowan is a cold calculating scientist in many respects, but Rowan has a conscience made out of pure gold. Let\u0027s just talk about us.¡¯\n \"I put my arms around her. Pure gold. The image struck me. Pure gold. I thought of the mausoleum and the mysterious stranger telling me that the mausoleum was made of gold.\n \" \u0027There\u0027s no way in the world you could run off to Europe with me,\u0027 I said. \u0027You need the treatment that Dr. Rowan is giving you at the medical center, don\u0027t you?¡¯\n \"She sighed. She nodded. \u0027It was a dream, running away. They\u0027re giving me hormone treatments and all kinds of nutrients, I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m in and out all during the week. I\u0027m wired up for two and three hours at a stretch. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much progress. I wanted to fly away. It was wrong of me to involve you in my dream, to let you believe it with me for a little while.¡¯\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t mind,\u0027 I said. \u0027I don\u0027t have to go. In fact, I won\u0027t go. Not as long as we can see each other, and I think they trust us now. I think they know that I won\u0027t hurt you, and you know it too.¡¯\n \"There came a rap at the door.\n \"Time for supper, and I was cordially invited to join them downstairs. In fact, they wouldn\u0027t hear of my not joining them, and after a quick call to Jasmine to report my whereabouts I appeared in the dining room to find Mona -- attired in another gorgeous white shirt with billowing sleeves, this time over a tropical print miniskirt-shorts combination that was, if anything, more sexy than her bare panties had been earlier -- and Michael and Rowan, somewhat formally attired.\n \"Michael looked quite the gentleman in his seersucker three-piece suit, and Rowan wore a lovely simple navy blue dress with a bold triple strand of pearls.\n \"Only on second glance did it register that Mona had put on Aunt Queen\u0027s cameo and that it looked beautiful at her throat.\n \"To my utter amazement Stirling Oliver of the Talamasca had come to join us and in keeping with the mild late spring weather he wore a white three-piece suit with a lemon yellow tie. I remember that tie for some reason. I don\u0027t know why. I remember men\u0027s ties. His gray hair was clipped short, combed straight back from his temples, and he looked like a man in his sixties of excellent health.\n \"They were all vivid impressive people and the house in no way overpowered them or diminished their easy charm.\n \"I was very glad to see Stirling again and had a strong sense that Aunt Queen would be disturbed if she knew. As it was I had little choice in the matter and that felt very comfortable for me.\n \" \u0027I saw your friend, Goblin, outside,\u0027 he said confidentially, as he shook my hand. \u0027He indicated you wished to be on your own.¡¯\n \" \u0027Are you serious?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Did you really see him and talk to him?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, he was right by the gate. He was very strong, but you must realize my talents for such perception are, if anything, rather over-developed. For me the world\u0027s a crowded place.¡¯\n \" \u0027Was he angry or bitter?\u0027 I asked.\n \" \u0027Neither,\u0027 he said, \u0027but rather glad to be seen.¡¯\n \"At this point Mona spoke up, taking our arms as she interposed, \u0027Why don\u0027t I invite him in? We\u0027ll make a place at the table for him?¡¯\n \" \u0027No, not tonight,\u0027 I said. \u0027I want to be selfish. He has his moments. This is one of mine.¡¯\n \"The dinner went on swimmingly, with lots of conversation about whether I should in fact go to Europe, and Michael felt that there comes in each person\u0027s life a perfect time to go to Europe and one can go either too early or too late. I agreed with that heartily and then dared to ask if it was at all possible for Mona to go if Aunt Queen would agree to bring another female chaperone dedicated entirely to Mona, and I made it clear in euphemisms, which the august dining room seemed to require, that I would never risk Mona\u0027s health or well-being for cheap lust.\n \"I hope I made half the potent figure that I tried to be. When only Mona consented to everything I said, Rowan went on to state matter-of-factly that Mona couldn\u0027t be away from Mayfair Medical at this time, it was simply out of the question, and that if it was at all possible she and Michael would take Mona to Europe so that Mona could have the experience again.\n \"In fact, Mona went on to explain that it had been on her trip to Europe that her \u0027condition\u0027 had been discovered and the tour had been cut short for that reason and she had come home to undergo intense study at the medical center, plus injections of hormones and nutrients and other drugs as well.\n \"Throughout, nobody mentioned Mona\u0027s mysterious child. And I didn\u0027t mention the mysterious stranger.\n \"We went into the double parlor after the supper and there I drank more brandy than I should. But I fixed the situation with a call to Clem to come get me in Aunt Queen\u0027s stretch limousine, with Allen to drive the Mercedes home, which worked out very well, since Aunt Queen was \u0027entertaining\u0027 in her room.\n \"Michael and Rowan showed no letup of interest in me, or if they did I was a perfect fool. Stirling Oliver was affable and curious as well. We talked about seeing ghosts and I told them all the entire story of Rebecca, again using all the appropriate euphemisms, which the parlor seemed to require. I had the feeling in my semidrunken pride that Mona was enjoying all of this.\n \"Her eyes were glistening and she never once interrupted me, which struck me as amazing given how very brilliant I found her to be. When she did talk it was to bring me out for Rowan and Michael and Stirling, or to bring them out to me. Of the three, Michael was by far the more talkative and the more given to laughing at himself, though Stirling had a great sense of humor, but Rowan was modest for a doctor, and, as I had found her in the afternoon, her husky voice was much warmer and sweeter than her finely angled face.\n \"She had the sharp gray eyes of a beauty, and one could believe she was a neurosurgeon by the look of her long tapering hands. Michael was the older one, the rugged one, the one who had worked on \u0027this house\u0027 with his hammer and nails. He spoke of feeling its embrace and of loving its shining floors and its creaks and groans in the small hours. And all of these three alluded modestly and naturally to having seen ghosts.\n \"Stirling talked of a childhood full of spirits in an English castle. And of discovering the Talamasca during his university years at Cambridge. Michael spoke of nearly drowning off the coast of San Francisco and being rescued by, of all people, Rowan, and of his having come through it with a power to know certain paranormal things through touch.\n \"Mona told them all laughingly that Oncle Julien had ransacked the pantry for Royal Antoinette to serve me the hot chocolate, and I told them about the poem by Christopher Morley which I had loved so as a child, and about the cocoa and animal crackers, which I had altogether forgotten to tell any of them until then, and they were impressed with it, and we speculated as to how spirits make up what they do.\n \" \u0027But it means God exists, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 asked Mona. There was the most poignant tone in her voice.\n \" \u0027God or the Devil,\u0027 said Dr. Rowan.\n \" \u0027Oh, it would be too cruel if the Devil existed without God,\u0027 said Mona.\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Rowan. \u0027I think it\u0027s entirely possible.¡¯\n \" \u0027Nonsense, Rowan,\u0027 said Michael. \u0027God exists and God is love.\u0027 And with a very deliberate nod to Mona he cautioned Rowan, and I saw at that moment that Mona was looking anxiously away. Then Mona spoke up.\n \" \u0027I guess I\u0027ll know soon,\u0027 she said, \u0027or I\u0027ll know nothing. That\u0027s the hard part. Blinking out like a burnt-out bulb.¡¯\n \" \u0027That\u0027s not going to happen,\u0027 I said. \u0027When you have your treatments at Mayfair Medical, is it tiresome? Can I come and sit with you? Is it possible we could talk or I could read to you? What is it like?¡¯\n \" \u0027That would be lovely,\u0027 said Rowan, \u0027until you get tired of it, which would happen at some point.¡¯\n \" \u0027Rowan, for the love of Heaven,\u0027 said Michael. \u0027What\u0027s gotten into you?¡¯\n \"Mona started to laugh. \u0027Yes, Quinn,\u0027 she said, laughing still, \u0027I have to be there for hours. I take the treatments intravenously, that\u0027s why I wear long sleeves, to hide the marks. It would be wonderful if you were with me. It doesn\u0027t have to be every time. And Rowan\u0027s right. When you get tired, I\u0027ll understand.¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027m ashamed that I\u0027ve never asked if I could visit you during these treatments,\u0027 said Stirling. \u0027We\u0027ve had so many suppers at the Grand Lumini¨¨re Caf¨¦. Why, it never crossed my mind.¡¯\n \" \u0027And don\u0027t think that you have to,\u0027 said Mona. \u0027I watch the worst television imaginable. I\u0027m hooked on vintage sitcoms. Don\u0027t give it another thought.¡¯\n \"I wanted to vow that I would never get tired. I would bring flowers, and books of poetry to read. But I knew that the realist among us would think all this very lame, and so I let it go for the moment, thinking that later, when it came time to leave, I would ask when I could see Mona again.\n \" \u0027I know one thing,\u0027 Mona announced, quite suddenly. \u0027When it comes my time to die, I don\u0027t want it to be at Mayfair Medical. I still cherish my dream of going out like Ophelia, on a boat of flowers in a softly running stream.¡¯\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t think it works very well,\u0027 said Michael. \u0027I think the flowers and the floating part of it are wonderful, but then comes the drowning and it\u0027s not so peaceful at all.¡¯\n \" \u0027Well, then, I\u0027ll settle for a bed of flowers,\u0027 she said. \u0027But there has to be a lot of them, you know, and no tubes and needles and bottles of morphine and such things as that. I can imagine the water as long as I\u0027m on a bed of flowers. And there are no doctors around.¡¯\n \" \u0027I promise,\u0027 said Michael.\n \"Dr. Rowan said nothing.\n \"It was an extraordinary moment. I was horrified. But I didn\u0027t dare to speak.\n \" \u0027Come on, everybody, I\u0027m so sorry I made it glum,\u0027 said Mona. \u0027Quinn, let me cheer you up. Have you ever read Hamlet? Will you read it to me sometime at Mayfair Medical?¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027d love to,\u0027 I responded.\n \"We had all seen Kenneth Branagh\u0027s landmark film of Hamlet and we\u0027d loved it, and of course I knew the Ophelia underwater scene so very well. It had been a still shot after Gertrude\u0027s long description, all of it beautifully done, due to the fact that Branagh is a genius, we all agreed. I wanted to tell them all about Fr. Kevin\u0027s warning about speaking to ghosts, based on what happened to Hamlet, but I wasn\u0027t sure how I felt about it so I let it slide.\n \"The remainder of the evening was marvelous. We talked of so many things. Michael Curry loved books, the way that my old teacher Lynelle had loved them, and he thought it was fabulous that I had a new teacher in Nash Penfield, and he thought it perfectly fine that I had never gone to school.\n \"Rowan agreed wholeheartedly that I had probably missed nothing, that except for a certain margin of affluent American kids who occupy a tiny portion of the classes in ultrafine schools, \u0027organized educational experience\u0027 was more painful and unprofitable than anything else.\n \"Stirling Oliver thought it incredibly wonderful that I was getting such an intense education, wondering aloud what it would be like if so many others could have the same benefits. As for Tommy, whom I described to everyone, everyone believed that he and his brothers and sisters should be given \u0027every chance.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t playing God to show them another world.\n \"I was very surprised by all this, and in a very real way I did not want to go home. I wanted to live in this house with Michael and Rowan and Mona forever. I wanted to know Stirling forever. But in another way, I couldn\u0027t wait to go home. I couldn\u0027t wait to be \u0027me\u0027 again, because I had been so strongly accepted. I wanted to tell Nash and Aunt Queen about it. I wanted to set about my studies with Nash. I wanted to set up my visits with Mona. I wanted once more to postpone my trip abroad.\n \"Now as to that -- postponing my trip -- Michael had a suggestion. Why not go for a couple of weeks? \u0027One can see a lot of Europe in that time,\u0027 he told me. \u0027And if you have to choose one country then let me suggest either England or Italy. Either one will send you back transformed.¡¯\n \"Everybody seemed to think it was a good idea. Stirling and Rowan also suggested Italy. I had to admit it was a good idea. It would quiet Aunt Queen\u0027s desires for me for a little while and Mona would be waiting, she vowed, to hear of all my adventures when I returned.\n \"Meantime, Clem had come for me, and though the conversation was moving along fiercely, with Michael describing his own visit to Italy, I knew it was time to go.\n \"Besides, I was really getting drunk.\n \"On the front porch I took Mona in my arms, vowing to call her the next day and get the times during which she would let me visit with her at Mayfair Medical.\n \" \u0027I spend my life there, egregious and beautiful boy,\u0027 she said. \u0027Pick a time, any time.¡¯\n \" \u0027When do your spirits flag?¡¯\n \" \u0027Four o\u0027clock. I\u0027m so tired of it. I begin to cry.¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027ll come at two and stay with you as long as you allow.¡¯\n \" \u0027That will be till six,\u0027 she said. \u0027Then we have dinner in the Grand Lumini¨¨re Caf¨¦.¡¯\n \" \u0027You can dismiss me then or have my attendance, as you wish. I come with no strings attached.¡¯\n \" \u0027You really do love me, don\u0027t you?¡¯\n \" \u0027Passionately and undyingly.¡¯\n \"Our final kisses were long and lingering, and drunkenly sweet.\n \"Then Michael Curry saw me to the gate, which did need a key to unlock it.\n \"He took me in his arms. He held me tight, and he kissed me, European-style, on each cheek. \u0027You\u0027re a good boy, Quinn,\u0027 he said.\n \" \u0027Thank you, Michael,\u0027 I said. \u0027I really adore her.¡¯\n \"As soon as Goblin and I were securely in the back of the limousine I burst into tears.\n \"On and on we drove, and I couldn\u0027t stop crying. And as we crossed the black waters of Lake Pontchartrain, Goblin put his arms around me and he said in his low voice, rather like Ariel in The Tempest, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Quinn; if I were human, I would cry too.\u0027 \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-31.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
