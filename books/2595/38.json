{"id":96945,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"38 \"I AWOKE once during daylight. I lay on a soft bed on a terrace, and all around me were flowers. There were potted geraniums along the balustrade, and beyond those were white-and-pink oleanders, and I thought in my dizziness and my madness that I could see a distant mountain to my right, which I knew certainly by its shape to be Vesuvius, and when I rose, sick and aching, I staggered to the edge of the oleanders and I looked down on the tile roofs of the town way far below me and saw that I couldn\u0027t escape in that way. \"Far to my left the road wound on with the cars like tiny beetles speeding along it. It was the coast of Italy in all its rugged glory, and beyond the road was the sizzling sea. The sun was high and blinding and it burnt down upon me, and there was no escape from it on this terrace. \"As for the house, it was locked against me. The dark green shuttered doors had nothing that I could even grasp. I fell back down on the bed and my eyes closed, though I willed them to stay open. \"My fevered mind said, You must escape here. You must go down the slope somehow. You have to drop to the roofs below. That this creature, Petronia, meant to murder me, I had no doubt. \"I felt unconsciousness creep over me again, hot and dark and full of desperation. Some drug was working in me still that I couldn\u0027t fight. \"Then, against the blue sky I saw the shadowy outline of a woman and I heard her talking low and fast in Italian and I felt a sharp stab in my arm. I saw the outline of the syringe in her hand as she held it up with a dainty gesture, and I wanted to protest but I couldn\u0027t. And next I knew, she was shaving my face with a small electric razor that was like a noisy little animal running all over my upper lip and my chin. \"She was speaking to another woman in Italian, and though I spoke a little Italian I couldn\u0027t tell what it was she was saying, only that she complained. Finally she moved to one side, and I could see her, and she was young and brunette and with an upturn to her eyes. \" \u0027Why you, I would like to know,\u0027 she said to me with a thick accent. \u0027Why not me after all this time? I serve and I serve, and she brings you to me and says make him ready. I am nothing but a slave.¡¯ \" \u0027Help me to get out of here,\u0027 I said, \u0027and I\u0027ll make you rich.¡¯ \"She laughed. \u0027You don\u0027t even want it, and they\u0027re giving it to you!\u0027 she said scoffing. \u0027And why? Because she has a whim.\u0027 Her voice was soft but insistent. \u0027Everything is a whim with her. To come. To go. To live in this palazzo. To live in that palazzo.\u0027 She laid down the syringe. I heard the clink of metal. She lifted a long scissors. She cut a lock from my hair. \" \u0027What did you put into me?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Why did you shave my face? Where is Petronia?¡¯ \"She laughed, and so did another young woman who appeared on the left side of me, opposite. She was also slender, fashionable-looking and pretty of face, just like the one who was trimming my hair. She stood with her back to the light, her shadow falling over me. \" \u0027We should kill you,\u0027 said the other woman, the new one, \u0027so that she can\u0027t do it. We could tell her that you died.¡¯ \"They both laughed at this joke uproariously. \" \u0027Why do you wish me harm?\u0027 I asked. \" \u0027Because she chose you instead of us!\u0027 said the one who had injected me. She was angry but she didn\u0027t raise her voice. \u0027Do you know how long we\u0027ve waited? We\u0027ve been teased by her since we were children. Always she has an excuse, except when she is angry, and then she offers no excuse for anything, and God help those who ask her for one!\u0027 She took a comb to my hair. \u0027You\u0027re ready as far as I can see.¡¯ \" \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 said the other one. She stood with folded arms. Her face was cold. She had beautiful sneering lips. \u0027We won\u0027t hurt you. She would know when she comes. And then she would kill us for certain.¡¯ \" \u0027Are you talking about Petronia?¡¯ \" \u0027You don\u0027t know anything,\u0027 said the one who had been combing my hair. \u0027She\u0027s just playing with you. She\u0027s going to kill you like all the rest.¡¯ \"I could feel the drug working in me, or was it my imagination? I was so hot, so miserable. I was neither drugged nor conscious. \" \u0027Don\u0027t try to get up,\u0027 said the woman with the comb. But I did try and I pushed her away from me. \"She fell back, murmuring in Italian. I think she was cursing. \u0027I hope she tortures you!\u0027 she said. \"I was flat on my back. I imagined myself crawling to the balustrade. I should have dropped down, no matter how low it was. I had been a fool not to try it. My eyes closed. I could hear their voices, their cheap, cruel laughter. I hated them. \" \u0027Listen to me,\u0027 I said. \u0027Help me to the balustrade. I\u0027ll go over it myself. You can tell her that I jumped. I\u0027ll probably die, and you\u0027ll be happy and free of me, just like. . . just like. . .\u0027 I couldn\u0027t make my mouth form the words. I wasn\u0027t sure I had said even what I thought I had said. \"I was swooning. I could no longer see. \"The bed was moving, and at first I thought it was my disorientation, but then I heard the squeak of the wheels. A coolness came over me and I felt my clothes being ripped from me, and then, down into a pool of warm water, my body was slipped. \"Thank God for it, I thought. The sweat and the heat were gone. Someone was bathing me and I didn\u0027t hear the voices of the young women anymore. \" \u0027Listen to me,\u0027 said a voice right close to my ear. \"I tried to open my eyes. In a flash I saw the ceiling painted with murals -- a great blue sky with flying gods and goddesses: Bacchus in his chariot and satyrs around him with wreaths and trails of green ivy, and the maenads with their hair ripped and their clothes in tatters following behind. Brand-new. Too bright. \"Then I saw the boy who was bathing me. He was one of those extraordinary young Italian beauties with a halo of black curls for hair, and a gorgeous naked chest and muscular arms. \" \u0027I\u0027m talking to you,\u0027 he said with a thick accent. \u0027Can you understand me?¡¯ \" \u0027The water feels good,\u0027 I tried to say, but I\u0027m not sure I managed the words. \" \u0027Can you understand me?\u0027 he asked again. \"I tried to nod but my head was against a rim of porcelain. I said, \u0027Yes.¡¯ \" \u0027She\u0027ll test you,\u0027 he said. He went on bathing me, lifting the water in his hands and letting it flow over me. \u0027If you fail her tests, she\u0027ll kill you. That\u0027s always her way with those who fail her. There is nothing to be gained from fighting her. Remember what I say.¡¯ \" \u0027Help me to get away from here,\u0027 I said. \" \u0027I can\u0027t help you.¡¯ \" \u0027Do you believe me?\u0027 I struggled to articulate it. \u0027When I say that I can reward you? I have plenty of money.¡¯ \"His eyes widened and he shook his head. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter if I believe you,\u0027 he said. \u0027She would find me, no matter where we went or what you gave me. She\u0027s too powerful for me ever to escape her. My life was finished the night that she saw me waiting tables in a caf¨¦ in Venezia.\u0027 He made a short bitter laugh. \u0027I wish to God that I had never brought her that little glass of wine, that useless little glass of wine.¡¯ \" \u0027There has to be a way,\u0027 I said. \u0027She\u0027s not God, this woman.\u0027 I was losing consciousness again. I fought it. I remembered the cold air and the stars around me. What was she? What kind of monster? \" \u0027No, not God,\u0027 he said smiling bitterly. \u0027Just powerful and very cruel.¡¯ \" \u0027What does she want with me?\u0027 I asked. \" \u0027Try to stand up to her tests,\u0027 he said. \u0027Try to please her. Otherwise you die. She never does anything else with those who fail her. She gives them to us, and we rid the world of the bodies, and for that we are allowed to continue to live. That\u0027s our existence. Can you imagine the place the Devil has for us in his inferno? Now, if you believe in God, use this time to say your prayers.¡¯ \"I couldn\u0027t speak anymore. \"I felt him raise my arms, one at a time, and shave the hair beneath them. It was a strange ritual, and I couldn\u0027t understand the desire of anyone for such a thing to be done. \"He seemed to sense my discomfort. \" \u0027I don\u0027t know what it means,\u0027 he said to me softly, \u0027but for you she has ordered us to take great care.\u0027 He shook his head sadly. \u0027Maybe it means nothing, maybe it means something. Only in time will we know.¡¯ \"I think I laid my hand over his and patted him to console him because he sounded so sad. \"All the while the water of the bath was warm and moving, and then he told me in my ear that he was taking me to a place where I would wake from the drugs I\u0027d been given, but I mustn\u0027t make noise. \"I slept. \"When I woke, I knew that I was alone. I could hear the silence and stillness around me, and I found myself on a couch and surrounded by golden bars. \" \u0027How my friend loves gold,\u0027 I whispered, \u0027but then I have always loved it myself.¡¯ \"Within seconds I realized I was in a glorified round cage. The door was securely locked, and I wore no boot or even a sandal with which to kick at it, and my fist did little good. \"As for my clothes, I\u0027d been dressed in a pair of black pants. No shirt. \"Now, outside of this cage there was a great marble room, precisely what one would expect in a hillside palazzo, and it had its large square floor-length windows open to a long terrace, as one might also expect, and there was the sunset streaking the sky with red, and the violet light simmering as the sun sank into the sea. \"Italy, so glorious, on the flank of the great mountain, and not very far no doubt from the ruins of tragic cities it had destroyed. \"I sat back on the couch, watching the windows fill up with early stars and the room darken before me, which only proved to put it in a gentler light. \"There was something so very decadent and perverse about the cage in which I was imprisoned that I loathed it intensely, yet it had an odd calming effect on me because I knew that in a monstrous game with Petronia I might have some chance. That had been the implication of the boy who had bathed me. At least that had been the inference which I drew. Nevertheless, I was revolted by everything around me. This was a completely new emotion for me. \"The lights came up slowly, revealing scattered lamps along the inner walls of the room and murals which somewhat mimicked those of Pompeii -- that is, rectangular paintings framing in Roman red various goddesses who danced with their backs turned to the room. \"And as these lights filled the space with a golden illumination there entered not the proud arrogant Petronia whom I expected but two other creatures equally strange. \"One was a black man, so black indeed that he looked like polished onyx, and though he was at the very far end of the marble room, away from me, I could see the gold earrings in his ears. \"He had very delicate features and he had yellow eyes. His hair was very curly and short-cropped and not totally unlike my own. \"The other man was a puzzle. He appeared old. Indeed, he had heavy jowls and receding temples and his hair was silver, but he appeared to be without blemish, as if he were made not from old flesh and blood but from wax. His eyes sagged slightly at the outside edges as if they were going to slide down his face, and his chin jutted, which gave him a firm look. \"This one, the old one, reminded me of someone, but I couldn\u0027t think who it was. \"Neither of these creatures looked human and there settled over me the certainty that they weren\u0027t. \"I flashed on the stars I\u0027d seen last night, or whenever it had been as we\u0027d risen into the air, and I felt a dreadful fatality -- indeed, an awful sense that everything I\u0027d known and loved was about to be taken from me and there was little really that I could do to prevent it. The test, the fight, the contest, whatever, would be a matter of form. \"I was mutely horrified and I sought to adjust my emotions. To be tantalized was my only hope. There was no time for wonder or curiosity. \"These two men came towards me but purely by accident. Though they looked at me, they seated themselves at a table in the center of the room. And there they began to play chess and to talk to each other, their profiles turned to me, which meant that the silver-haired man with the waxy jowls had his back to the star-studded sky and the black man looked out. \"Both of these creatures wore immaculate evening dress of a sort. They had on shining black dinner jackets and trousers and patent leather shoes. But they wore white turtlenecks of some very glossy material rather than shirts and black ties. \"They were soon laughing and joking with each other, and the language was Italian, so I couldn\u0027t follow what they said. But when I\u0027d had a bellyful of it, I spoke up. \" \u0027So neither of you will enlighten me,\u0027 I asked, \u0027as to why I\u0027m held captive here? You don\u0027t think I\u0027d be in this predicament of my own free will?¡¯ \"It was the elderly-looking gentleman who answered me, his chin jutting even more as he did so. \u0027Well, now,\u0027 he said in clear English, \u0027you know you did something to be here. Now, what did you do to Petronia? She wouldn\u0027t have brought you here if you were innocent. Don\u0027t claim to be that with us.¡¯ \" \u0027That\u0027s exactly what I claim,\u0027 I said. \u0027I was brought here out of her caprice, and I ought to be released.¡¯ \"The black man spoke to the other. \u0027I do tire of her games, I swear it.\u0027 His voice was mellow and sweet, as though he was used to power. \" \u0027Oh, come, you know you enjoy it as much as I do,\u0027 said the elderly one. His voice was deep. \u0027Why else would you be here now? You knew she had this boy.¡¯ \" \u0027All I ask is to be released,\u0027 I said sharply. \u0027I can\u0027t send the authorities after you because I don\u0027t know who you are, and as for Petronia, all attempts in the past by me to have her discovered or arrested have failed, and they\u0027ll fail in the future. I won\u0027t attempt any such thing. What I ask is to be let go!¡¯ \"The black man rose from his armchair and he came towards me. He was the taller of the two. I didn\u0027t stand up to measure my height against his. He reached through the bars and laid his cool hand on my head. He looked into my eyes. I hated him. It took all my self-control to remain still. \" \u0027You\u0027ve done no wrong to anyone,\u0027 he said under his breath, as though he had read it from my mind. \u0027And across the world she brings you for her blood sport.\u0027 He sighed. \u0027Oh, Petronia, why the cruelty, always the cruelty? Why, my beautiful pupil? When will you ever learn?¡¯ \" \u0027You\u0027ll let me go?\u0027 I asked. I looked up at him. What a splendid being he was. His features were sublimely chiseled and his face looked kind. \" \u0027I can\u0027t do that, my child,\u0027 he said in an even voice. \u0027I wish that I could, but I believe your fate is decided. I\u0027ll try to make your agony short.¡¯ \" \u0027Why does my life mean so little to you?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I come from a world where every life is precious. Why is it so different for you?¡¯ \"The old man had approached by this time, walking in a sprightly manner completely out of keeping with the appearances of age in him, and he was peering through the bars at me too. \" \u0027No, you\u0027re not innocent, don\u0027t tell us that,\u0027 he chortled. \u0027You\u0027re the Evil Doer in some guise,\u0027 he protested. \u0027She wouldn\u0027t bring you here otherwise. I know her too well.¡¯ \" \u0027Not well enough,\u0027 said the coal black one. \u0027She does what she pleases and it\u0027s never enough for her.¡¯ \"I stared at the old man. \u0027The old man,\u0027 I said aloud, and then I realized it. \u0027The Old Man,\u0027 I said again. \u0027It\u0027s you. The portrait on the living room wall! It\u0027s Manfred Blackwood, that\u0027s who you are.¡¯ \" \u0027And who are you to say my name so boldly to me?\u0027 he demanded. He puffed himself up. \" \u0027You\u0027re demons, all of you. God, this is Hell.\u0027 I laughed. I felt the drug in me again. There was no escape. My words came in a rush. \u0027If it weren\u0027t for Julien Mayfair, you\u0027d be my ancestor. I\u0027m Tarquin Blackwood, that\u0027s who I am. She took me from the Hermitage, the Hermitage you built for her, and that I refurbished for her. Blackwood Manor\u0027s in my hands now. Your granddaughter, Lorraine, is still living, living to mourn for me and tear out her hair that I\u0027ve disappeared from Blackwood Farm. Didn\u0027t Petronia tell you what she was up to?¡¯ \"He went into a fury. He tried to shake the bars but he couldn\u0027t. He pounded upon the lock. Now he was an old man in all his parts, his jaw trembling, his eyes tearing. \u0027Abomination!\u0027 he roared. \"The black one tried to calm him. \u0027Now, let this matter be in my hands,\u0027 he said. \u0027We have an order here of authority.¡¯ \" \u0027Do you see what she means to do?\u0027 the Old Man shouted. His jowls trembled. All of him trembled. His eyes were inflamed as he gazed at me. \u0027Who told you about Julien?\u0027 he demanded, as if such a thing were important now. \" \u0027Julien himself told me. I\u0027m a seer of spirits,\u0027 I retorted. \u0027But what does it matter? Get me out of this place. Your granddaughter Lorraine needs me. Blackwood Farm needs me. I have flesh and blood that need me.¡¯ \"Suddenly Petronia herself appeared. Clad in a black velvet tunic and pants with a belt of cameos, she came striding across the long room and up to the two men, declaring as she did: \" \u0027What is this, the convocation of the cage?¡¯ \"As Manfred tried to seize her by the throat she threw him backwards, so that his body went yards across the marble floor and slammed into the wall, his head snapped back in a blow that would have killed an ordinary human and out of his throat came a deep and terrible roar. \" \u0027Don\u0027t dare to question me,\u0027 she said. \"The black one, as though nothing could perturb him, reached out for her and slipped his arm around her neck. He was taller than her by some inches. Probably he was my height. He brought her head down onto his shoulder and I saw her hand tremble as she let him do it, and he whispered to her, \" \u0027Petronia, my dearest, why, why always the rage?¡¯ \"He held her and she allowed herself to be held, and the Old Man wept as he collected himself, came forward, wounded, furious, helpless, shaking his head. \" \u0027My own,\u0027 wept the Old Man, \u0027and your pledges to me are worthless, your bond is worthless --.¡¯ \" \u0027Leave me alone, you fool,\u0027 she said, raising her eyes and turning her head to look at him. \u0027I\u0027ve kept my pledges to you ten times over. I\u0027ve given you immortality! What in hell do you want? And then on top of it riches undreamt of. This boy is nothing to you but something sentimental, like the photographs you keep of your precious Virginia Lee and your son William and your daughter Camille, as if these people were anything to you in the dust of time. They are not.¡¯ \"The Old Man sobbed. Then he spoke, blubbering. \" \u0027Stop her, Arion,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t let her go on. Stop her.¡¯ \" \u0027Wretched, miserable, old man,\u0027 Petronia said. \u0027Old forever. Nothing could give you youth. I despise you.¡¯ \" \u0027And that\u0027s your reason for what you\u0027ve done to me?\u0027 I asked. It would have been wiser perhaps to say nothing, but in some way this case was being tried before Arion, the black one, and I had to make some effort or die full of regret. \"Petronia looked at me, and, as if seeing me for the first time, she smiled. And as always happened when she smiled, she looked serene and lovely. She was still in the arms of Arion, and Arion was stroking her loose full hair. It was utterly loving the way that Arion held her. Her breasts were against him, and he seemed to adore her. \" \u0027Don\u0027t you want to live forever, Quinn?\u0027 she asked me. \"She slipped gently out of the embrace of Arion, and she took from underneath her black velvet tunic a gold chain, and on the end of this chain was a key, and with this she unlocked my handsome prison. \"She opened the door. With the meanest fingers imaginable she grabbed my left arm and yanked me from the couch and out into the room, slamming me up against the bars. It sent a shudder of pain through me. \"Arion remained close, staring at me, and the Old Man was some distance away. He had taken a small picture from his coat and he looked at it piteously. I wondered if it was of Virginia Lee. He was whispering to himself insanely. \" \u0027Are you prepared to fight for immortality?\u0027 Petronia asked of me. \" \u0027Not at all, not one wit,\u0027 I said, \u0027nor for my life. Not against the bully that I know you to be.¡¯ \" \u0027Bully!\u0027 She mocked me. \u0027You call me that? After you had your familiar attack me with flying shards of glass?¡¯ \" \u0027He did what he could to protect me. You were in Blackwood Manor. You meant to do me harm.¡¯ \" \u0027And why isn\u0027t he here?\u0027 she asked. \" \u0027Because he can\u0027t be. You know this,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m no match for you. I saw what you did to Manfred a moment ago. You play an unfair game with me. You always have.¡¯ \" \u0027Stubborn,\u0027 she said as she smiled, cruelly this time, and shook her head. \u0027Always your way. Pride, that\u0027s your sin.¡¯ \"Arion reached out for me and took my head in both his hands, and I felt his soft silky thumbs against my cheeks. \u0027Why don\u0027t you let him go?\u0027 he asked. \u0027He\u0027s innocent.¡¯ \" \u0027But that\u0027s the best kind,\u0027 said Petronia. \" \u0027Then you mean truly to do it,\u0027 said Arion, stepping back, \u0027not merely to kill him?¡¯ \" \u0027I mean to do it,\u0027 she said nodding, \u0027if I find him fit for it, if I find him strong.¡¯ \"Before I could protest, before I could mock, before I could sneer or plead or whatever might have come into my head, she picked me up and threw me, as she had done with Manfred, against the far wall. The blow to my head was terrific, and I thought, This death is not going to take very long. \"At the same time I became enraged as I always do by such hurt, and, falling down on the floor, I sought to get up immediately, and I flew at her, missing her and falling on my knees. \"I heard her cruel laughter. I heard Manfred weeping. Where was Arion? I looked up and caught a glimpse of the two men seated in their chairs at the table. And where was she? \"She slipped her hand under my shoulder and yanked me to my feet and slapped me hard on the left side of my face and then threw me across the floor. I went sprawling. It was pointless to try to fight. It was everything to keep to my word. To give her no sport at all. But I couldn\u0027t keep to it. Again, I tried to get up. \"Now, I knew nothing of fighting. Or I should say all I knew of it was what I had watched in boxing, which was my favorite spectator sport. And there was no way to apply what I knew in this situation, and I had never acquired any skill at fighting myself. \"But as I rose to my feet this time I saw Petronia standing right before me, and it seemed commonsensical that if I ran low at her I could topple her, and so I did this, tackling her right below the knees, and over me she went. \"The men laughed at this, which was unfortunate. I would rather have had cheers. But spinning round I came down on her before she could rise, and I tried to put my thumbs into her eyes. She caught me around the throat with both her hands, and now, fully enraged, she threw me over and back on the floor and then dragged me across it until she had come to the balcony, at which point she grabbed both my wrists in one hand and slung me over the white railing and asked me if I would like to be dropped to my death. \"I could see the lights of the traffic far below on the winding road. I could also see the ocean boiling on the rocks just beyond it. I gave her no answer. I was dazed. I also thought I was doomed. I knew Manfred didn\u0027t have the power to stop her. And I didn\u0027t think that Arion would. \"That I had thrown her over only made things worse. \"Next I knew she had drawn me up and thrown me onto the floor again and was kicking me and dragging me about the room. I thought of her as a giant cat again, as I had in the Hermitage, and of myself as her prey. \" \u0027This is not the way to do such a thing,\u0027 Arion said to her. I heard it near me as though he had come up to her, but where we were in the room, I didn\u0027t know. \"Petronia said, \u0027We choose our own way, don\u0027t we? We must do it the way we want to do it. In a fraction of a second, all his wounds will heal. He\u0027ll know the power of the Blood when that happens, and it will be all the finer for him. Let me have what I need.¡¯ \" \u0027But why, my darling, why do you need it?\u0027 Arion said. \u0027I don\u0027t understand, my precious one, why the rage, always the rage?¡¯ \"They went on talking but they had switched back into Italian. I sensed that he was talking about the passage of time and that she had once been different, but that was all I could divine. The Old Man continued to cry. \"I tried to move and then I felt Petronia\u0027s foot on my throat. I was choking. She let up on the pressure and I saw her face above mine, her hair pouring down and tickling me as she drew me up to her with both her hands. My weight meant nothing to her. She came in close to me as though she meant to kiss me on the throat. \"I lay back on a couch, and she had her arms behind my back, and her mouth was open against my skin, and then I felt two sharp pinpricks on the side of my throat, and the world and all my pain went dim. I heard her heart beat. \"Teach me, she said. I will not have my kiss be quiet. \"That she was sucking my blood from me I knew, and that I was getting weaker and weaker I knew as well. And it did seem that all my life fled from me, that image after image of childhood, young manhood and the last few years of love and ecstasy and wonder fled from me with my blood -- uncontrollably, unstinting and pure. What this intimacy meant in the greater scheme of things I was helpless to understand, and then she drew back and I went limp in her arms. I sank down, free, onto the floor. \"Petronia had hold of my arm. She was dragging me again. I felt the sharp kick of her foot in my ribs. I could no longer see. I could hear the Old Man cry out. I knew it was for me that he cried. But she merely cursed under her breath. The marble felt cold beneath me. I lay sprawled against it. \"Suddenly the scene changed. I was no longer in my body but looking down on it, and down on all the occupants of the room. I was at the entrance to a long dark tunnel, and a roaring wind surrounded me, a frightening wind, and at the end of the tunnel there appeared a wondrous light, a light truly beyond description, and in that light, huge gold-and-white light, I could see the figures of Pops and Sweetheart gazing at me. Lynelle was also with them. I wanted desperately to join them, but I couldn\u0027t move. Some hideous fascination with Petronia and Manfred and Arion prevented me from moving. Some putrid ambition kept me from turning and reaching out for those I so loved. There was no clarity in me. There was only turbulence. Then, as suddenly as this vision had come, it was gone. I had made no decision. \"I was back in my aching and bruised body. I was on the marble floor again. \" \u0027You\u0027re dying,\u0027 Petronia said. \u0027But I know you now, I know you from the Blood, and I won\u0027t let it happen, Tarquin Blackwood. I claim you as my own.\u0027 Again, her arms lifted me. \" \u0027Ask him what he wills,\u0027 said the black one named Arion. \" \u0027What do you will?\u0027 she demanded. She held me up on my knees in front of her. I could feel her velvet pants against me. \u0027Speak to me,\u0027 she said. \u0027What do you will?¡¯ \"Helpless and clumsy I fell against her crotch, grabbing for her leg and then recoiling, and near collapsing, as she jerked my shoulder and held me on my knees. \" \u0027What do you want!\u0027 she demanded again. What was I to say? To die? In this place, around the world from Aunt Queen, from Mona, from all I loved, to die without a trace? \"I raised my fist, trying to hurt her. I hit her but my fist had nothing behind it. I clawed at her velvet clothes. I tried to hit her again. I struck at her private parts. \" \u0027Oh, you want to see it, do you? You want to see what they all laughed at!\u0027 she said. \u0027Come now, pay me homage,\u0027 she said. I heard the snap opening, and then my hand was placed upon the short, very thick stub of her erect cock, then down lower, between two pendulous labia, the shallow crevice that was her vagina, then back again to her cock. \u0027Take it in your mouth,\u0027 she said to me angrily. I felt the pressure against my lips. \u0027Take it!\u0027 she demanded. \"I did the only thing I could do. I opened my mouth, and when she shoved her cock into it I bit down with all my might and main. I heard her howl but I hung on. And there came into my mouth a copious flow of electrifying blood such as I never expected -- and madly I hung on. \"I bore down with my teeth and the blood, this liquid fire, streamed into me. It poured down my throat. I swallowed without meaning to swallow. It was as if my body, once drained by her, could not resist it, and suddenly I realized that her hands were cradling my head and her howling was laughter and that the blood was not blood as I knew it but a great rush of stimulating fluid that seemed to come from her heart and her brain. \"Know me. Know who I am! This she said to me, and there came a rush of knowledge into me which I couldn\u0027t deny. I would have turned away from it if I could. I hated her that much. But I couldn\u0027t turn away, and now I couldn\u0027t let go. \"Long, long centuries ago she had been born to an actress mother and a gladiator father in the Rome of Caesar, a freakish child, half male, half female, a thing to be destroyed by ordinary parents but kept by hers for the theater, in which she grew to be a gladiator of great strength by the age of fourteen. \"Before that point, a thousand times she\u0027d been shown privately to those who could pay for it, for those who wanted to touch her and have her touch them. Never had she known love for her own sake, or privacy, or a moment of delicacy, or a scrap of clothing that wasn\u0027t for show. \"In the arena she was fierce and murderous. I saw the spectacle -- the huge crowds roaring for her. I saw the sand red with the blood she shed. She won every match, no matter how heavy or great her opponent. I saw her in her shining armor, her sword at her side, her hair tied back, her eyes on Caesar as she made her regal bow! \"Years passed during which she fought, her parents commanding ever higher and higher fees. At last, when she was still a girl, she was sold to a merciless master for a fortune, and he sent her into the ring against the fiercest of wild beasts. Even these could not defeat her. Nimble and fearless she danced against lions and tigers, thrusting her spear deep and true to the mark. \"But she grew tired in her heart, tired of combat, tired of lovelessness, tired of misery. The crowd was her lover, but the crowd was nowhere in the dark of night when she slept chained to her bed. \"Then Arion had come, Arion had paid to see her as had so many. Arion had paid to touch her, as had so many. Arion had bought dresses to pose her. Arion had embraced her. Arion had liked to comb her long black hair. Then Arion had bought her and set her free. Arion had given her a heavy purse and said, \u0027Go where you please.\u0027 But where could she go? What could she do? She couldn\u0027t bear the sounds of the circus during the games. She couldn\u0027t bear the thought of the gladiatorial schools. What was there for her? Was she to be pimp and whore at the same time? She had tagged after Arion, loving him. \" \u0027You are my life now,\u0027 she had told him. \u0027Don\u0027t turn your back on me.\u0027 \u0027But I gave you the world,\u0027 he had answered her. Unable to bear her tears, he had given her more money, a house in which to live. But still she came to him weeping. \"And finally he took her under his wing. He brought her to his city. He brought her to beautiful Pompeii. His was the cameo trade, he told her. He had three shops of cameo makers, the finest in all of the empire. \u0027Can you learn this art for me?\u0027 he asked her. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027For you I would learn anything. Anything at all.\u0027 She set to work with a passion she\u0027d never known. She wasn\u0027t fighting for multitudes, she wasn\u0027t fighting for her own worthless life. She was fighting to please Arion, a fragile and total thing. Her enemies were clumsiness, impatience, anger. She studied with all the masters in his shops. She watched. She imitated. She worked in shell, in stone, in precious jewels. She mastered the chisel, the small drill. She learned all that she could. \"Finally, at the end of two years, she had her specimens to show Arion, fine and perfect things. She had done gatherings of gods and goddesses like unto the friezes on the temples. She had done portraits like unto the finest in the Forum. She had made art out of a craft. Never had he seen such work, he told her. He loved her. And such happiness she\u0027d never known. \"Then came the terrible days of Vesuvius, the eruption of the mountain and the death of the idyllic little city where they had all known such happiness. Arion had fled the night before to the far side of the Bay of Naples. He\u0027d sensed early on the evening before the eruption what was to happen. It had been her duty to see that the slaves of the shops escaped. But only a few would listen to her. \"And when it was all over and the air was full of ash and poison and the sea was full of bodies, when nothing remained where Pompeii had once stood, she had come to Arion\u0027s villa -- the very place where we were now -- weeping and with only a handful of followers, to tell him that she had failed. \" \u0027No, my beloved,\u0027 he said. \u0027You have saved my finest prize, you have saved your own life when I thought that all was lost. What can I give you for this, my sweet Petronia?\u0027 And in time he had given her the Blood that she was giving me. In time he had made her immortal as she was making me. \"She let me go. My lips stroked her cock as I withdrew. \"I fell back on the floor. But I could see with new eyes all around me. And I felt the bruises all over my body healing. I felt the pain leave my head. I sat up as though waking from a dream and I looked out the open window over the railing, and the pure azure of the evening sky caught me and held me and I didn\u0027t hear the voices of the room. \"Arion came. He took hold of me and lifted me just the way she had done it, without effort, and then he reached up to his throat, and he said to me to Drink. \" \u0027No, wait please,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Let me savor what she taught me of herself. If you will.\u0027 I meant it reverently. \"But she flew at me and knocked me to the floor again and there came her foot against my ribs. \u0027Trash!\u0027 she said. \u0027You dare answer that way to the Master, and who are you to savor what you know of me!¡¯ \" \u0027Petronia!\u0027 said Arion to her. \u0027Enough.¡¯ \"He picked me up. \u0027My blood will give you added strength,\u0027 he said. \u0027Take it. It\u0027s far older than hers, and you won\u0027t be bound to her so very much.¡¯ \"I could have cried at her savagery. I had so loved her in the Blood, and I had been a fool for it, such a fool, but as he said now to drink, I ran my tongue over my teeth, why I didn\u0027t know. And I discovered the eyeteeth were fangs, and with them I kissed his throat, as he had directed me, and there came a new stream of images and blood. \"These images I can\u0027t claim to remember. I think that somehow, through some skill, he guarded his generous and older heart. I think he gave me the Blood and its strengthening power without all his secrets. But what he did give me was inexpressibly glorious and it filled my hurt soul after her rebuff. \"I saw Athens in him. I saw the famed Acropolis thronged and thriving. I saw it with temples and images brilliantly painted as I had been taught it was painted, not as we now see Greek art, as white and pure, but done in vivid blues and reds and flesh tones, oh, the marvel of it! I saw the Agora filled with people! I saw the whole town spread on the gentle slopes of the mountain. My head teemed with priceless visions, and where he was in all this I couldn\u0027t guess. I felt the language of the people all around me, and I saw the hard stone street beneath my sandals, and felt his blood pumping into me, washing my heart and my soul. \" \u0027Only the Evil Doer, my child,\u0027 he said to me as the Blood pounded. \u0027Feed only on the Evil Doer. When you hunt, unless you take only the Little Drink, pass by the innocent heart. Use the power you will have from me to read the minds and hearts of men and women and ferret out the Evil Doer everywhere, and only from him take the blood.¡¯ \"Finally, he pulled me back. I licked the blood from my lips. I sighed. This was to be my only nourishment. I knew it. The knowledge had come to me instinctively. And much as I had loved the taste of his blood and the taste of Petronia\u0027s blood, I hungered for a base human so that I would know that taste as well. \"He stroked my forehead and hair with his silky hands and he looked into my eyes. \" \u0027Only the Evil Doer, you understand me, young one? Oh, the innocent beckon. They do it unwittingly. And how savory they seem. But mark my word, they\u0027ll lead you straight to madness whether you have an educated soul or no. You\u0027ll come to love them and to despise yourself. Mark my words, it\u0027s the tragedy of Petronia. For her there is no innocence and therefore no conscience and therefore no happiness. And so in misery she goes on.¡¯ \" \u0027I follow your rules,\u0027 Petronia said. I heard her nearby. \" \u0027You did not with this one,\u0027 said Arion emphatically. \" \u0027My grandson, my very grandson,\u0027 cried the Old Man to himself in his misery. \u0027You blaspheming wretch.¡¯ \" \u0027And so he will live forever,\u0027 said Petronia solemnly. She laughed. \u0027What more can I do? What more can I give?¡¯ \"I turned to look at her. With these precious eyes I saw her harsh loveliness as though it were a miracle. \"And I knew what had been done to me. Of its history, of its commonness, of its rules, of its limits I knew nothing. But I knew what had been done. Immortality. I knew it but couldn\u0027t grasp it. Where was God? Where was my faith? Had the whole edifice collapsed in this monstrosity? \"I began to feel a wrenching pain. Was I deluded? \"Arion said: \" \u0027This is human death. It\u0027ll take a few short moments. Go with the attendants into the bath. They\u0027ll dress you afterwards, and then you\u0027ll learn how to hunt.¡¯ \" \u0027So we are vampires,\u0027 I said. \u0027We are the legend.\u0027 The pain in my gut was intolerable. I saw the male attendant I had known before. He was waiting. \" \u0027Blood Hunters,\u0027 said Arion. \u0027Defer to me with these words, and I\u0027ll love you all the more.¡¯ \" \u0027But why do you love me at all?\u0027 I asked. \"Placing his hand on my shoulder, he said, \" \u0027How could I not?\u0027 \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-38.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
