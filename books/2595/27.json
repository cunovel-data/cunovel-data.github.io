It sent the chills up me and the panic came again in a brilliant wave, almost causing my teeth to chatter.\\n\\n \"I could hear Rebecca\u0027s voice in my head and I was afraid I was going to get dizzy. When I had described these dizzy states to the doctors at Mayfair Medical they had spoken of small seizures.\\n\\n \"But how could such an explanation account for this -- furniture duplicating that which I had only seen well in a dream? The fact was the seizure theory accommodated nothing.\\n\\n \" \u0027Mona, my darling love,\u0027 I said as we approached the table, \u0027I need you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027What you need more than anything in the world,\u0027 she said, \u0027is to be with Stirling Oliver.\u0027 But I could see the passion in her eyes; I could see that she was holding back. I could see the evidence of my progress with her.\\n\\n \" \u0027And what we all need is supper,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, who greeted me with a kiss and then planted one on Mona\u0027s cheek also.\\n\\n \" \u0027You know, dear,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027you really are quite beautiful.¡¯\\n\\n \"Aunt Queen had decked herself out in a sack dress of beige satin, long strands of pearls, a shell cameo at her throat and the most glittering spike heels I\u0027d seen ever. The band across her toes was studded with diamonds and the brilliantly wrought cameo of Apollo with his lyre at her neck was surrounded by tiny diamonds also.\\n\\n \"The entire supper arrangement was illuminated by soft floodlights attached to the side of the house and also by a ring of candles in hurricane lamps. The wicker was exceptionally detailed and well constructed -- what an antique dealer would have given a small fortune to have -- and as I studied it the atmosphere of the dream returned to me. Rebecca said in my ear, Red-haired bitch. I tasted dream coffee. The chills were quietly passing over me. A wave of terror passed over me. A life for my life. A death for my death.\\n\\n \"We were seated at once in the newly painted peacock chairs, and yes, I realized, Goblin\u0027s place was there to my left as it always was, and I had not even thought to ask for it.\\n\\n \"My mind and body were aswim with sensations. Merely glancing at Mona on my right side made me want to carry her up to bed. And then a dull misery from Rebecca\u0027s dream kept breaking through. Go into the Light, I silently prayed. I tried hard to focus on what was around me. I had to be a man for Mona. And this was no place to become a centaur.\\n\\n \"Jasmine, got up exquisitely in a tiny-waisted violet suit with a frothy white blouse, brought the tarragon chicken and rice to us. Big Ramona, in her usual crisp white apron, was pouring the wine.\\n\\n \"I could see that Aunt Queen had been working some kind of magic with Jasmine. Jasmine was experiencing some change in status. Jasmine had a glamour to her, and surely I wasn\u0027t responsible for it.\\n\\n \" \u0027And look at the shoes on these lovely ladies, would you?\u0027 I said to Nash and Mona. \u0027It makes me want to kiss their feet.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Eat your supper, Little Boss,\u0027 said Jasmine in an under voice. \u0027You\u0027re not kissing my feet.¡¯\\n\\n \"Mona laughed.\\n\\n \" \u0027Nothing succeeds,\u0027 Nash replied, \u0027like excess.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027I must say it is a pleasure being here in these glorious surroundings. I\u0027ve never heard the cicadas sing like this except here in Louisiana.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And how have you spent today?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I feel that, having fallen in love with Mona, I\u0027m neglecting you, but discovering one\u0027s future bride can be very distracting. I\u0027ve become a happy madman.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And well it should distract you,\u0027 he replied. \u0027And you mustn\u0027t worry about me for a moment. This is all so new to me, so fascinating. I\u0027ve been quite fine. I took a long early afternoon nap and then spent a wonderful time surveying your Aunt Queen\u0027s fabulous collection of cameos.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Cameos,\u0027 said Mona. \u0027You mean you have more than what we saw in the living room case?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Hundreds more,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027Spanning my whole life, and you can well imagine how long that is. But here, a toast to Mona Mayfair, our lovely young guest, and to Nash Penfield, who will soon guide us on the Grand Tour, and to my great-nephew, who this day came into part of his inheritance.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Mona\u0027s going with us to Europe, Aunt Queen,\u0027 I declared. \u0027Is there any way we could leave before midnight? Mona will be going as my bride.¡¯\\n\\n \"Mona was clearly startled, but she didn\u0027t laugh. She only beamed at me, and then boldly she leaned over and kissed my cheek. \u0027You would really marry me tonight?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I think you\u0027re truly and egregiously in love with me.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Absolutely and forever,\u0027 I said. \u0027But we don\u0027t have to wait for the ceremony. We could fly out tonight, and get married in Paris. Aunt Queen does it all the time -- just flying out. We\u0027d need your passport of course, but I\u0027d go back to the house with you --.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Darling,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary. I think I see the Mayfairs coming up the drive now.¡¯\\n\\n \"It was a giant black stretch limousine, just like Aunt Queen\u0027s car, crunching the gravel down as it lumbered to a stop before the front steps of the house.\\n\\n \"Mona turned around, then she turned back and she looked at me. The tears rose in her eyes. \u0027Tarquin,\u0027 she said, \u0027would you really take me with you tonight?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Yes, absolutely!\u0027 I said. \u0027Aunt Queen, you know it\u0027s what you want, that I go to Europe, that I be educated! Nash, you can guide and tutor all of us.\u0027 I would die for Mona, I knew it. I would fight everyone in that car.\\n\\n \" \u0027Nash,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027go and greet them for me, darling. I see the security man rising to his feet. Call him off. I\u0027ll never make it across the lawn in these shoes. Be the front man, will you, dear?¡¯\\n\\n \"Mona quickly explained that it was Ryan Mayfair, the lawyer and father of Pierce, and Dr. Rowan Mayfair, and her husband, Michael Curry, who were now approaching the table. I stood up naturally, but Mona did not, and I moved behind her chair and I placed my hands on her shoulders. I had my back to those coming up the lawn. I was being rude. I was bracing for battle.\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t worry, my brave Ophelia,\u0027 I said under my breath, \u0027you shall not perish while this brave Laertes lives.¡¯\\n\\n \"But the most curious aspect to all this for me was not my own pounding heart, it was the cautious and almost hostile expression on Aunt Queen\u0027s face as the little party came around to the left of me, with Nash quickly inviting them to sit down.\\n\\n \"They all declined a chair. They were very much \u0027in a hurry,\u0027 but were very thankful. \u0027We\u0027ve come to pick up Mona,\u0027 said Dr. Rowan Mayfair in a very soft and polite voice. I believe it\u0027s what you call a whiskey voice. \u0027Mrs. McQueen,\u0027 she said with a little nod of her head, \u0027you have a magnificent house.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Well, I hope someday,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027you can come to visit.\u0027 But she was not her usual warm self when she said these words, and she was scrutinizing the group of them in a way I\u0027ve never seen.\\n\\n \"Introductions were made all around, Ryan Mayfair looking as if he\u0027d been born in his Brooks Brothers suit and Michael Curry, being the oldest and rough cut but a very handsome guy in his safari jacket, with his beautiful salt-and-pepper hair and a very easy manner. He had a very Irish look to him with his square face and blue eyes. The lawyer was uncomfortable and Dr. Rowan Mayfair wasn\u0027t exactly at ease either. Dr. Rowan had a high-cheeked, sleek beauty to her with bobbed hair. There was something undeniably frightening about her, though her manner was low-key.\\n\\n \" \u0027Come on, Mona,\u0027 said Dr. Rowan, \u0027we\u0027re here to take you home. You gave us a bit of scare slipping out this morning.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I want you to leave me alone!\u0027 Mona said. It was practically a cri de coeur.\\n\\n \"I could scarcely bear the sound of it, and I flew into action without even moving. I held her shoulders. My heart was racing.\\n\\n \"But suddenly Dr. Rowan adopted an ominous face and said, to my complete shock, \u0027Michael, take her.¡¯\\n\\n \"Both Ryan Mayfair and Michael Curry moved towards Mona, and Mona screamed, backing up and overturning the chair, and I threw my arms tightly around her. She pivoted in my embrace and buried her face in my chest. She felt like the most fragile and precious little creature that I had ever known or loved, and I intended to fight for her.\\n\\n \" \u0027Come now, gentlemen,\u0027 said Nash in a gentle commanding voice, \u0027surely you\u0027re not trying to take this young lady by force! Mrs. McQueen, are you a neutral party in all of this?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Indeed not,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027Jasmine, run get the men.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Wait a minute,\u0027 said Michael Curry, and he made the universal gesture with both his hands for patience. He came on like the sweetest guy in the world. \u0027Mona, please stop the theatrics and come home, you know you have to. Mona, I don\u0027t want to be doing this. Nobody does, but you can\u0027t go off like this. Look at it from our point of view.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m going to marry her,\u0027 I said. \u0027And if you lay a finger on her, I\u0027ll break your face. Oh, I can see you\u0027ve got brawn on your side, plenty of it, but I\u0027m young and I\u0027m meaner than I look, so don\u0027t try me.¡¯\\n\\n \"As for Goblin, he had risen to his feet and I had whispered to him to do nothing. What he could have done I didn\u0027t know, but it frightened me and thrilled me at the same time.\\n\\n \"By now Clem and Allen were running towards the patio. And the security man had come from the front porch to stand by Aunt Queen, his hand on his gun.\\n\\n \"Aunt Queen motioned for Clem and Allen to come on and then stop.\\n\\n \" \u0027Aren\u0027t you all being a bit ridiculous about this?\u0027 Aunt Queen asked. \u0027This girl is having supper with us. I\u0027ll have my car bring her home this evening. I\u0027ve never seen such hysterics before. Dr. Mayfair, I\u0027m shocked.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Mrs. McQueen,\u0027 said Dr. Mayfair. Her voice was still low and husky, and very sincere. Yet a terrible power enforced her words. \u0027Mona\u0027s fifteen years old. Her parents are both dead. Sometimes she does things that are impulsive. I\u0027m her legal guardian. I want her to come home, and as you can see, she won\u0027t do it.¡¯\\n\\n \"Michael Curry shook his head as if to say, The sadness of it, and then very gently he touched Mona\u0027s hair. He spoke to her in a soft soothing voice.\\n\\n \" \u0027Now come on, honey, I know how you feel.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027No, you don\u0027t,\u0027 she sobbed against me. \u0027None of you do.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Mona, I love you,\u0027 he said, and then he went on tenderly. \u0027Let us take you back, sweetheart. You can see Quinn tomorrow. Quinn, you could come by the house, couldn\u0027t you? We\u0027d be glad to have you. What about tomorrow afternoon? Come on, darling.¡¯\\n\\n \"I grabbed her head and whispered in her ear, \u0027Go home and get your passport and be ready.¡¯\\n\\n \"Dr. Mayfair shook her head as if she too hated this predicament. Or as if she\u0027d heard my whisper. The lawyer, Ryan, the smoothie in the suit, never changed his pained expression. I think he was mortified but resigned. He was a good-looking son of a bitch, I had to give him that, and that probably meant his son, the infamous enemy Pierce, was also good-looking.\\n\\n \"Finally Mona turned around and, still clinging tight to my arm, she looked at them.\\n\\n \" \u0027I hate you that you did this to me,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I hate you all. I don\u0027t trust you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Dear God, child,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027What do you want us to do?¡¯\\n\\n \"Nash looked totally alarmed. Allen and Clem were ready for battle. The security man was on full alert.\\n\\n \" \u0027She has to come home, Mrs. McQueen,\u0027 said Dr. Rowan patiently and courteously. Her face was too serene. \u0027Quinn, can you come see Mona tomorrow? I think Michael\u0027s suggestion was a good one.¡¯\\n\\n \"Mona turned to face me again, and with her back to the evil three she mouthed the word \u0027passport.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll come at three o\u0027clock, all right?\u0027 she said. But her fingers secretly pressed the number two against the inside of my arm.\\n\\n \" \u0027Yes, three o\u0027clock, I\u0027ll come.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You can be our guest for dinner,\u0027 said Dr. Mayfair. \u0027Mrs. McQueen, Mr. Penfield, I\u0027m sorry for all this. Truly I am.\u0027 She had such a frank simple manner that her words were almost believable. I mean by that that I couldn\u0027t hate her as much as I wanted to. But she was still scary in a secret way.\\n\\n \"Mona kissed me on the cheek. I took hold of her and kissed her on the mouth. \u0027I love you,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m coming to get you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Be careful of all the ghosts,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Be very careful, and remember, if I somehow become unreachable, or they pull some trick, go to Stirling Oliver. Oak Haven is the southern Retreat House of the Talamasca. Everybody knows where it is. Oak Haven Plantation. It\u0027s on the River Road near Vacherie.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Got it,\u0027 I answered.\\n\\n \"She backed up. \u0027I\u0027ll see you tomorrow,\u0027 she said. \u0027Aunt Queen, thank you for the supper. Mr. Penfield, it was so nice talking with you.¡¯\\n\\n \"Suddenly she paused, staring at Aunt Queen, whose own face was the picture of distress. And then Mona went to her and embraced her and kissed her.\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, darling, sweet little darling,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027God bless you and keep you. And here\u0027 -- Aunt Queen unhooked the diamond-studded cameo from her throat -- \u0027you take this.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, no, I couldn\u0027t,\u0027 Mona said.\\n\\n \" \u0027No, you must. Always remember us by it.¡¯\\n\\n \"Mona was going to break into tears again. Taking the cameo clenched in her hand she pivoted and went off fast, and the uncomfortable trio followed her, all of them piling into the awkward stretch limousine, which made a U-turn in the drive and soon vanished in the direction of the highway.\\n\\n \"Jasmine told our palace guard to go back to the kitchen. The security man seemed genuinely disappointed as he headed back to the front porch. Jasmine took my plate and gave me a hot helping of chicken and rice.\\n\\n \"I burst into tears. I just cried like a little kid. I cried and cried. I just sat there not caring who thought what and I cried. So what if I was eighteen. I cried.\\n\\n \"Nash came over to put his arm around me and Aunt Queen cooed to me and called me her poor darling.\\n\\n \" \u0027I never wanted anything so badly in all my life,\u0027 I said. \u0027I just love her.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, my precious Little Boy,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027Why on earth does it have to be a Mayfair!¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But what\u0027s wrong with them, Aunt Queen?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Good Lord, we went to their hospital! We go to their church. Fr. Kevin is a Mayfair. I don\u0027t get it.¡¯\\n\\n \"Nash gave my neck a firm squeeze and went back to his chair.\\n\\n \" \u0027Jasmine, give Nash a fresh plate,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027And you, Little Boy, please eat something. How can you be six foot three and not eat something?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m only six foot one,\u0027 I explained, \u0027it\u0027s Nash that\u0027s six foot three. Nash, thank you for your moral support. Aunt Queen, I don\u0027t understand this.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Well, my boy,\u0027 she said, lifting her glass of white wine for Jasmine to refill, \u0027I\u0027m not sure I understand it myself, but the Mayfair family has always been viewed with suspicion. Dr. Rowan Mayfair, the genius behind Mayfair Medical, is perhaps the most universally admired of the clan, and she has immersed herself in public life and public service.\\n\\n \" \u0027But even Dr. Rowan is a mysterious figure. At one point she was so severely injured that all hope was given up, and then she made a miraculous recovery.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Well, you can\u0027t blame her for that, surely,\u0027 I interjected.\\n\\n \" \u0027Can\u0027t I?\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027I can tell you it wasn\u0027t through the intercession of a saint that she came back from the dead. That much is true.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But what are you saying?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027As you saw, she\u0027s very restrained and sure of herself by nature,\u0027 Aunt Queen said. \u0027And perhaps she is a good person, perhaps she is a very good person. But the rest of the family is another matter.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But what do you mean? The lawyer was like a loaf of white bread.\u0027 (Of course I was stealing Mona\u0027s words, but so what?)\\n\\n \" \u0027He\u0027s quite well respected,\u0027 Aunt Queen admitted, \u0027though his practice is mostly dedicated to the family. I\u0027m speaking of other things. And surely you haven\u0027t forgotten that he manages our money. But there has been talk for years of congenital madness in the female line. Well, and in the male line as well. Mayfairs were drugged, locked in padded cells, even let their house on First Street fall into ruin at one time, though now that Mr. Michael Curry has come it\u0027s wonderfully restored, or so they tell me. Then there\u0027s the matter of Michael himself, almost drowned once in the swimming pool.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But what could that mean?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t know, darling, I\u0027m only trying to convey that they\u0027re shrouded in mystery. It\u0027s a family with its own law firm and its own priest. Rather like the Medici, don\u0027t you think, and you know how the people of Florence used to rise against them and throw all their artworks out of the palazzo windows!¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027As if the people of New Orleans would riot against the Mayfairs!\u0027 I scoffed. \u0027You\u0027re not telling me everything.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t know everything,\u0027 she replied. \u0027They\u0027re a haunted family and some say they\u0027re cursed.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You met Mona,\u0027 I said. \u0027You know she\u0027s lovable and brilliant. Besides, we\u0027re a haunted family, too.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Something\u0027s wrong,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. She hesitated.\\n\\n \"I saw her eyes veer off. She looked at the place where Goblin sat watching her very steadily. She knew he was there, and as I turned to him I saw that he was locked to her.\\n\\n \"She went on, eating tiny bits of chicken daintily as she talked:\\n\\n \" \u0027There are many old stories about Mayfair women having unusual powers -- an ability to call spirits, an ability to read minds, to know the future. But more than anything else there is this question of hereditary madness.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Mona can see Goblin, Aunt Queen,\u0027 I said, glancing at him and then back to her. \u0027She has that power. Where in the world for the rest of my life will I find a beautiful brilliant woman who can see and love Goblin?¡¯\\n\\n \"I glanced at him again. He stared coldly at Aunt Queen. And she was staring at the spot where he sat. I knew she was seeing something.\\n\\n \" \u0027You know anyone who marries me,\u0027 I went on, \u0027is marrying Goblin.\u0027 I took his right hand and squeezed it. But he didn\u0027t respond.\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t be sad, Goblin.¡¯\\n\\n \"Aunt Queen shook her head. \u0027Jasmine, more wine, please, darling. I think I\u0027m getting drunk. Be sure Clem\u0027s on alert to help me to my room later.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027ll help you to your room,\u0027 I said. \u0027Those breakneck shoes don\u0027t scare me. I\u0027m about to be married.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Quinn,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027did you see how they have taken Mona home? Now please forgive my candor, but it seems to me that they are very afraid of Mona forming any alliance that can lead to her getting pregnant.¡¯\\n\\n \"Nash asked if he should excuse himself. Aunt Queen said absolutely not, and I also nodded to it.\\n\\n \" \u0027Nash, if we\u0027re all going to Europe together,\u0027 I said, \u0027you have to know who we are.¡¯\\n\\n \"He sat back nursing his soda quietly.\\n\\n \" \u0027Quinn, am I being unfair,\u0027 Aunt Queen asked, \u0027if I suggest that something intimate might have happened between you?¡¯\\n\\n \"I was stunned. I couldn\u0027t answer them. I couldn\u0027t tell them all that Mona had told me -- the story of the strange child, that it had been a mutation, that it had been taken away. I couldn\u0027t pass on these confidences.\\n\\n \" \u0027Maybe we are crazy,\u0027 I said, \u0027both of us. She being able to see Goblin, imagine that. And both of us seeing ghosts. She talked of it all from a scientific point of view. I felt like I wasn\u0027t a freak. I felt like she and I were of the same ilk. And now it seems this person, this precious person whom I so loved is being stolen from me.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Darling, it\u0027s only for one evening,\u0027 said Aunt Queen patiently. \u0027You\u0027ve been invited there tomorrow afternoon.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And you\u0027re not dead set against my going?\u0027 I asked. I started cleaning up the chicken and rice on my plate. I was hungrier than ever. I wonder what trauma could have shaken my appetite. \u0027I thought you\u0027d feel just the opposite.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Well, this may surprise you,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027but I think you might accept this invitation for a very good reason. Few people outside the family ever get to see the interior of that mysterious Mayfair house, and you ought to take advantage of the privilege. Also I have a hunch that when you see Mona again, some of this fire will burn itself out. Of course I may be wrong, the child\u0027s gorgeous, but it\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping for.¡¯\\n\\n \"I was plunged into misery but eating like a pig. \u0027Listen,\u0027 I said, \u0027if I can get her away from there, with her passport, can we set out for Europe immediately?¡¯\\n\\n \"I could see the continued amazement in Nash\u0027s otherwise placid and dignified face, but Aunt Queen looked a bit provoked.\\n\\n \" \u0027Tarquin,\u0027 she said, \u0027we\u0027re not stealing the girl. Jasmine, more wine please. Jasmine, you\u0027re not yourself. When have I ever nagged you so much?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Miss Queen,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s just those Mayfairs scared me. The stories people used to tell about their house, it was awful. I don\u0027t know if a boy Quinn\u0027s age --.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Bite your tongue, beautiful!\u0027 I said, \u0027and you can pour me some wine, too. I\u0027m going tomorrow.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027They had a ghost!\u0027 Jasmine said, quite belligerently. \u0027It used to scare off any workman who ever tried to work on that property. You remember my cousin Etienne, he was a plasterer, and they called him to that house, and the ghost pulled the ladder from under him.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, stuff and nonsense,\u0027 I said. \u0027And Etienne used to tell fortunes in the cards.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I can do that too, Little Boss,\u0027 Jasmine sent back. \u0027I can read your cards, if you want, and tell you what your fate is.¡¯\\n\\n \"She took my plate and heaped it with a second helping. The chicken was really delicious now, and the gravy was thick.\\n\\n \" \u0027Jasmine\u0027s telling you the truth, darling,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027They\u0027re a haunted family, as I said.\u0027 She paused. \u0027Before Dr. Rowan came out from California, no one would go near that house. Now they have big family get-togethers there. They are an immense clan, you know. And that\u0027s what I fear when I think of them. They\u0027re a clan, and a clan can do things to you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027The more you say, the more I love her,\u0027 I responded. \u0027Remember, I got my passport in New York, when I was there with you and Lynelle. I\u0027m ready to rumble. But what do you mean, they\u0027re a haunted family?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027For years,\u0027 she said, \u0027it was a dreadful ghost, just as Jasmine described. He did a lot more than push people off ladders. But he\u0027s gone now, this illustrious ghost. And what surrounds them is talk of genetic mutations.¡¯\\n\\n \"I had to be quiet. But it didn\u0027t work. She went quiet too.\\n\\n \" \u0027What happened to the dreadful ghost?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027Nobody knows except that something violent occurred. Dr. Rowan Mayfair almost lost her life, as I mentioned. But somehow or other the family got through it. Now Mona, Mona came down from an intensely inbred line of the family. That\u0027s why she\u0027s been named the Design¨¦e of the Legacy. Can you imagine? Being chosen because you are inbred? If there are genetic problems, you might guess that Mona has them.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t care,\u0027 I said. \u0027I adore her.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Mona didn\u0027t grow up at the house at First and Chestnut. She grew up on St. Charles Avenue, not very far from Ruthie\u0027s house, and her people went back to a plantation house in the country. There was a murder. Mona wasn\u0027t a rich little girl, by any means.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Mona told me all this. So she wasn\u0027t rich. Do I have to love somebody rich? Besides --¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You keep missing the point. The child is now in line to inherit the Mayfair fortune.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027She told me that, herself.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027But Quinn, don\u0027t you see?\u0027 she persisted. \u0027This child is under intense scrutiny. The Mayfair Legacy involves billions. It\u0027s like the capital of a small country. And here she\u0027s gone from an unstable family to inherit an unimaginable fortune. Nash, you explain it. The girl\u0027s rather like an heir to the throne of England.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Nash in a very mild professorial manner. \u0027In the sixteenth century it was an act of treason to court young Elizabeth or Mary Tudor because they were in line for the royal crown. When Elizabeth finally became queen, the men who had dallied with her were executed.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You\u0027re implying the Mayfairs might kill me?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027No, indeed not, what I\u0027m trying to say,\u0027 Aunt Queen returned, \u0027is that they will reclaim Mona no matter where she goes or how. You saw for yourself. They were quite prepared to pick her up bodily and carry her to that limo.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027We should never have let her go,\u0027 I said. \u0027I have a terrible feeling about it.¡¯\\n\\n \"I glanced at Goblin. He looked solemn and remote, his eyes on those opposite me.\\n\\n \" \u0027When you see her tomorrow. . .\u0027 Aunt Queen began, but then she broke off.\\n\\n \" \u0027Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,\u0027 I murmured. \u0027How long must I endure until I see her? I want to go to the house now and climb the vines to her window.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027No, darling, don\u0027t even contemplate such a thing. Oh, we never should have gone to Mayfair Medical, but how did I know that the little heiress would be in the Grand Lumini¨¨re Caf¨¦?¡¯\\n\\n \"Jasmine refilled my plate with plenty more of the chicken and rice. I started eating again.\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t trust anybody now except Mona,\u0027 I said. \u0027I love you, you know that, but I\u0027m in love with her, and I know, positively know, that I will never love anyone as I do her. I know it!¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Quinn, dear, it\u0027s time for the worst tidbit of gossip.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I can take anything,\u0027 I said between forkfuls.\\n\\n \" \u0027They\u0027ve already arranged a husband for Mona,\u0027 said Aunt Queen gently. \u0027It\u0027s her cousin Pierce.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027She told me that, too,\u0027 I said, fudging just a little. I gestured to Jasmine for more wine.\\n\\n \" \u0027Did she tell you that Pierce is her first cousin?¡¯\\n\\n \"Even I was shocked by that. But I didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, darling,\u0027 Aunt Queen said with a sigh, \u0027I want to set our course for Europe right away, but we\u0027re not going to be able to take Mona Mayfair.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Well, I can assure you,\u0027 I said, \u0027I\u0027m not getting on any plane for anywhere without her.\u0027 \" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-27.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \\n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
