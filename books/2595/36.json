I slipped Terry Sue all the twenties I had in my wallet, and that was plenty.\n \" \u0027All right, you behave yourself, Tommy Harrison,\u0027 she said. And she gave him a big kiss.\n \" \u0027Brittany, I\u0027ll call you tonight,\u0027 he said to his sister.\n \" \u0027You\u0027ve grown up to be a beautiful girl,\u0027 I told her.\n \"Of course Aunt Queen was showering her with compliments, and had even taken off her cameo -- one of the new ones from the town of Torre del Greco -- and given it to her.\n \"These tender emotions I had anticipated, and, tired as I was, I let them grip me, and was glad of them, but as we drove away in Aunt Queen\u0027s big car, as I sat back, exhausted from our long flight, and looked out the window, I was totally unprepared for the tremendous feeling that swept over me at the sight of the verdant grasses growing unkempt along the highway and the swaying oleanders in full bloom and the occasional oak trees, which meant we were truly home.\n \"I felt Louisiana all around me, and I loved it. And by the time we had reached the pecan tree drive before the house I was so choked up I could hardly speak into the intercom to ask Clem to stop the car.\n \"I got out and looked down the long vista at the house. It was inexplicable, the feeling in me. It wasn\u0027t happiness. It wasn\u0027t sorrow. Yet it was rendering me helpless and bringing only the sweetest tears.\n \"Nash helped Aunt Queen from the car and she stood beside me. We both looked at the distant white columns.\n \" \u0027That\u0027s your home,\u0027 she said. \"It will be yours forever,\u0027 she continued. \u0027You must take care of it after I\u0027m gone.¡¯\n \"I put my arm around her and I bent down and kissed her, realizing perhaps for the first time how very tall I was, and feeling awkward in my somewhat new body. Then I let her go.\n \"As we continued up the drive, one aspect after another swept the same feelings of love and anguish over me, or maybe it was sorrow. I couldn\u0027t identify it. As the wash of childhood memories paralyzed me and humbled me, I only knew I was home.\n \"Of course I thought of Goblin, but I felt nothing of his presence. And of course I thought of Patsy and I expected to see her by and by. But it was the very landscape itself that evoked these titanic emotions in me -- the sight of Pops\u0027 flower beds, the rolling lawns, the oaks leaning their dark elbows over the cemetery, the creeping swamp with its uneven wall of gnawing trees.\n \"Things happened very fast after this. And my extreme exhaustion made the events of the day fragmentary and disconnected yet bright and clear.\n \"I remember that there were no paying guests in the house because Jasmine had held all the bedrooms for Tommy and Nash and Patsy.\n \"I remember that I ate a monstrous breakfast cooked by a tearful Big Ramona who chastised all of us ferociously for having been gone three and one-half years. I remember that Tommy ate with me and that he seemed as impressed by Blackwood Manor as he had been by castles in England and palazzi in Rome.\n \"I remember that a darling little boy came in, a charming Anglo-African blending of blue eyes, distinguished African features and curly blond hair, who told me proudly his name was Jerome and that he was three years old, on both counts of which I congratulated him, wondering who in the world were his parents. I announced that I found him to be verbally very far advanced.\n \" \u0027That\u0027s because he lives in this kitchen the way you used to do,\u0027 said Big Ramona.\n \"I remember that Aunt Queen\u0027s doctor came and said she had to have bed rest for at least a week, and her nurses should be there round the clock. It was old age, he whispered to me. And once she properly recovered from her overexertions she should be right fine. Her blood pressure was a medical marvel.\n \"I remember that I spent a desperate half hour on the phone trying in vain to reach Mona. Mayfair Medical would not even acknowledge she was there. And servants at the First Street house would give me no information either. At last I reached Michael, who would tell me only that Mona was sick; pray for her, yes, but to see her was out of the question.\n \"It made me frantic. I was ready to go directly to Mayfair Medical and search for her, room to room, when Michael suddenly said, as if he could read my thoughts:\n \" \u0027Quinn, listen to me. Mona has asked that you not see her. She\u0027s made us promise repeatedly that we won\u0027t let you in. It will break her heart if we break our word. We can\u0027t do it. It would be selfish for you to come. Don\u0027t you understand what I\u0027m saying?¡¯\n \" \u0027Good heavens, you mean she looks sick as well as feels sick? She\u0027s deteriorated. She\u0027s --.\u0027 I was stymied.\n \" \u0027Yes, Quinn. But don\u0027t give up hope. We are a long way from doing that. We\u0027re trying to build her back up. Her appetite is good. She\u0027s holding her own. She\u0027s got her books on tape. She\u0027s got her films. She sleeps a lot. That\u0027s to be expected.¡¯\n \" \u0027Does she know I\u0027m back?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, she does, and she loves you.¡¯\n \" \u0027Can I send her flowers?¡¯\n \" \u0027Yes, you can do that, but be sure you put Ophelia Immortal on the card, won\u0027t you?¡¯\n \" \u0027Why can\u0027t I talk to her by phone? Why can\u0027t we use E-mail?¡¯\n \"There was a long pause and then he said,\n \" \u0027She\u0027s too weak for it, Quinn. And she doesn\u0027t want to do it. She\u0027s sick to her stomach, son. But this won\u0027t go on forever. She\u0027ll get better.¡¯\n \"As soon as I rang off I ordered tons of flowers, baskets and baskets of Casablanca lilies and marguerites and zinnias and everything I could think of. I hoped they would fill her isolation chamber. Every card was to be writ large, to my Ophelia Immortal.\n \"After that I remember that I drifted into the kitchen, light-headed with jet lag and grief, and I saw Tommy playing Scrabble with little Jerome and I thought how incredible that the little guy could play the game at the tender age of three, until I realized Tommy was actually just teaching him words like \u0027red\u0027 and \u0027bed\u0027 and \u0027web\u0027 and \u0027do\u0027 and \u0027say\u0027 and \u0027go.¡¯\n \"I remember drifting into the pantry and thinking the child was one of Jasmine\u0027s little nieces or nephews and asking her, \u0027Who are his parents?\u0027 and hearing her say, \u0027You and I are.\u0027 I remember nearly fainting. But that\u0027s a figure of speech. She also said to me, \u0027His middle name is Tarquin.¡¯\n \"I remember going back out, feeling I was floating, and staring at my son and at my adopted thirteen-year-old uncle, and feeling myself utterly and totally privileged with these two generations, and when Jasmine appeared I put my arm around her and kissed her and she pushed me away, saying under her breath that there had been enough of that, and I ought to know it.\n \"I was positively groggy as I made my way to Aunt Queen\u0027s bedroom, and she looked up at me from her chaise lounge, where she was already under one of her white satin quilts with her feathered negligee stirring hither and thither with the motion of the overhead fan, and said:\n \" \u0027Darling boy, go to sleep. You\u0027re white as a sheet. I slept on the plane, but you didn\u0027t. You\u0027re staggering.¡¯\n \" \u0027Are you drinking champagne?\u0027 I exclaimed. \u0027You must, for we have something to celebrate.¡¯\n \" \u0027You come here to me!\u0027 Jasmine called out as she chased after me. But I wouldn\u0027t be deterred.\n \" \u0027Champagne it is!\u0027 I said, discovering the chilled bottle in the ice, and an extra glass, and that Aunt Queen was already happily swilling.\n \"What time was it? Who cared? I drank and then I told her all about Jerome, even as Jasmine dug her finely buffed fingernails into my arm and whispered curses into my ears to which I responded not one syllable.\n \"Aunt Queen was overcome with happiness! \u0027Why, splendid!\u0027 she declared. \u0027And all this time, Tarquin, I thought you were a virgin! Bring this child to me. And Jasmine, you amaze me. Why on earth didn\u0027t you write to us and tell us! This calls for child support among other things.¡¯\n \"And so the handsome little infant was brought into the presence of the Queen, and groggily and happily I drank two more glasses of champagne before becoming totally incoherent. By then my son had been told that I was his father. And Tommy had received the news too, being advised by Aunt Queen that in this house we kept no secrets, a fact which would work to the betterment of all of us.\n \"I remember staggering to Aunt Queen\u0027s bed, and someone, some very blessed individual, sweeping away her many fancy quilts and boudoir dolls so that I could fall facedown into the immaculate pillows, and that same someone, no doubt, pulled off my shoes, and I was soon under the heavenly weight of the quilts and in the chill of the air conditioner, fast asleep.\n \"I dreamed a dream of Goblin. It was an awful dream that he was suffering and couldn\u0027t come to me. I saw him incomplete, a gaseous and hideous being, struggling to be solid, but without my will he was indistinct and loose and miserable. I knew myself in the dream as cold and cruel to him.\n \"I danced with Rebecca. She said, \u0027I would not take you for my vengeance. You have been too good.\u0027 \u0027Who then would you have?\u0027 I asked, and she answered me only with laughter. She went away and the music went with her. I opened my eyes.\n \"Aunt Queen lay beside me. She wore her silver-rimmed glasses. She was reading her paperback The Old Curiosity Shop, which I had given her on the plane, and she said to me:\n \" \u0027Quinn, Dickens is a madman.¡¯\n \" \u0027Oh to be sure,\u0027 I said. \u0027It becomes wilder and wilder, all the darkness surrounding Little Nell; just keep going.¡¯\n \" \u0027Oh, I will,\u0027 she said.\n \" \u0027She snuggled up to me. The feathers of her negligee tickled my nose but I loved it. I loved her frail arm so close to mine. I could read the book in her hands if I wanted to. I smelled her sweet perfume. She could buy anything in the world and she wore drugstore Chantilly, and a sweeter scent in all the world there is not.\n \"I remember seeing the violet sky through the windows.\n \" \u0027Lord, it\u0027s almost dark,\u0027 I said. \u0027I have to go to the Hermitage! I have to see my Petrine masterpiece.¡¯\n \" \u0027Tarquin Blackwood, you will not go out in that swamp at this hour.¡¯\n \" \u0027Nonsense, I have to,\u0027 I said, kissing her forehead and then her soft powdered cheek. \u0027Both Mona and Goblin are denied to me, and of Goblin\u0027s loss I have nothing to lament, I confess it, but I must go out there and claim what I\u0027ve done.¡¯\n \"I remember further protest, but I was deaf to it.\n \"I hurried up the stairs and into my room and into my closet, and I knew myself to be light-headed still as I pulled on a new pair of jeans and a new shirt and new boots (all purchased for my new size by Big Ramona as soon as she knew we were coming home) and then I took my thirty-eight pistol from the nightstand and headed down and out of the house. From the kitchen I took a bottle of water and a big knife, and from the shed a flashlight, and then I went down towards the swamp.\n \"Of course I was disregarding the terms of my bold and savage partner, but I had never agreed to them, had I? It was for myself that I had done the refurbishment and the renovation of the Hermitage. It was for me the fine furnishings that I would soon see. I had no fear of him, and if anything I felt a brooding curiosity to see him again and contend with him -- perhaps to have a decent conversation with him. Perhaps to discuss \u0027our\u0027 little house and to discover whether we did indeed have a bargain, since I had achieved all of the splendid renovations, not he.\n \"That Goblin was not with me to help me did not matter to me. I would handle it. The Hermitage was mine.\n \"As I passed the little cemetery going down to the landing I stopped for a moment near Rebecca\u0027s grave. I shone the flashlight on her tombstone. A frisson of the dream came back to me, and I heard her voice again in my memory as though she was near to me. \u0027Not your life,\u0027 she said. \u0027Whose life then?\u0027 I asked. And I felt a sense of foreboding, a dreadful sense of it -- as though life itself were full of nothing but misery.\n \"Wasn\u0027t Mona sick unto death, nauseated and miserable, and here I was going out to the Hermitage with no thought of her? Mona wanted so badly to see the Hermitage. But what could I do but pray for Mona?\n \"The sky was darkening. I had to go.\n \"When I returned I\u0027d go to Mayfair Medical. I\u0027d search the wards. What hospital room doesn\u0027t have a window for nurses to peep inside? I\u0027d get as close to Mona as I could. Nobody would stop me, but for now it was the Hermitage that beckoned. I had to go.\n \"Into the pirogue I piled my gear, and, double-checking my gun for bullets, I set out. There was just enough light from the reddening sky to see the trees clearly and I knew the way now, and it soon became evident that the many pirogues of the renovation had plainly marked a trail. They had worn the way, one might put it. And I was soon speeding along.\n \"In less than half an hour I saw the lights of the Hermitage! And as I pulled up to its new landing and tethered the pirogue, I saw the brilliantly lighted windows and the gleam of the white marble stairs. All around the little house were neat beds of flowers, and the wisteria vine came crawling splendidly over its high roof. The little building resembled a small Coptic church with its many arches.\n \"In the doorway, facing me, indeed watching me, was the stranger, in his male attire, hair full and loose, neither beckoning me to come closer nor putting up his hand to forbid my coming ashore.\n \"How was I to know this was the last day of my mortal life? How was I to know that all those random little things which I have described to you would mark the end of my history -- that Jerome\u0027s father, Tommy\u0027s nephew, Aunt Queen\u0027s Little Boy, Jasmine\u0027s Little Boss and Mona\u0027s Noble Abelard were about to die?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-36.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing.
