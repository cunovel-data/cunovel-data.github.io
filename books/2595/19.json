{"id":96926,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"19 \"BY THE TIME we reached Mayfair Medical I was a gibbering idiot in a bloody nightshirt. I was in the back of Aunt Queen\u0027s limo with her on one side and Clem on the other and Big Ramona in front of us, on the J seat, and Jasmine at the far end of the J, back to the driver, everybody begging me to calm down. Clem\u0027s fingers were biting into my arm and Aunt Queen was exerting as much pressure as she could. At one point, Big Ramona told Aunt Queen to move, and she took ahold of me like a professional wrestler. \"It was the old story. The more you tell people you\u0027re not insane the crazier they think you are. And they clearly thought I was crazy. \"How many times did I say that the intruder had been in the house? How many times did they tell me that was impossible? How many times did I tell them that Goblin broke the glass, Goblin saved my life, how many times did they exchange their urgent heartfelt glances? \"I was still raving when we pulled into the Emergency porte cochere, and they had a gurney ready for me. Of course I swore up and down that I didn\u0027t need it. Then I realized I was barefoot and my feet were scratched from the glass. All right. Hospital regulations. \"I could have dressed properly before we ever left home, if only people had listened. \"But off I went into the Emergency Room, where the nightshirt was unceremoniously cut off and topical medicines were applied to the cuts and scrapes all over me. \"As to my head, I told them that the pain was killing me. The stranger had slammed me against the wall. Give me something for my headache if you do nothing else. You can forget about the scratches and bruises. \"And bruises there were aplenty. And when I saw how bad they were, I started yelling for Aunt Queen and Jasmine to come. Oh, if only Pops were here! Oh, damn! \"They began to tie me down and I went truly crazy. \"All the time, Goblin was with me, very strong, very visible, his face full of concern, but I didn\u0027t dare try to speak to him and he knew it. After the energy he had used I couldn\u0027t understand why he still looked so dense and so powerful. He didn\u0027t like what was happening. He made no bones about it. And suddenly I became terrified that he would start breaking the glass and the whole scene would devolve into chaos. \" \u0027Goblin, don\u0027t do anything in here,\u0027 I said, staring at him. \u0027It will only make it worse. Let me just play it on out.¡¯ \"Then Dr. Winn Mayfair himself, proud scion of the legendary Mayfair family and working head of the whole complex, approached the gurney. It seemed a spell fell over the Emergency Room, doctors and nurses mesmerized by the mere presence of the guy. \"I calmed down too. I was quite literally bound hand and foot, and why should I object to this doctor examining me? \"Now, the only reason I knew anything about Dr. Winn Mayfair was that Lynelle had told me all about him. He had been born in New Orleans, reared in Boston and become a physician up North, coming South only when the family here contacted him and offered him a dream job at the new medical center. \"He had become the partner and confidant of Rowan Mayfair, the other M.D. member of the famous clan, the one who had created and endowed the center and designed all its special features. \"It was Dr. Winn who took over the actual day-to-day management of everything, whereas Dr. Rowan worked tirelessly in research having to do with human growth hormone, Lynelle\u0027s old dream. \"Somewhere behind the scenes was Dr. Winn\u0027s father, Dr. Elliott Mayfair, a cardiac surgeon, and he had also been persuaded to transplant back home, and Rowan, Elliott and Winn Mayfair were the backbone of the establishment. \"Dr. Winn had a reputation for having a very quiet voice and a very gentle touch. His field had been neurosurgery -- the same field as that of Dr. Rowan Mayfair -- and the two were said to be cousins who resembled each other in temperament and gifts, as well as physical looks, though they had only met recently, each quite astonished at the other. \"Lynelle had worshiped the guy. \"What I saw was a smooth, brilliant and attentive man, tall and lean, who had been roused from bed to meet Miss Lorraine McQueen and her legendary boy prodigy who communed with the Dead. \"He had beautifully groomed silver blond hair and cold blue eyes behind rectangular wire-rimmed glasses, and he talked to me under his breath, which tended to give his words a confidential tone, which I frankly welcomed. He also spoke slowly. \"At once he took my blood pressure himself, though a nurse had done it before, and then he looked into both my pupils. He put his stethoscope to my head, listening for the longest time, as though my brain were talking to him. Then he felt my glands and he inspected the bruises on my arms. His touch was reverent. \" \u0027I know your head hurts,\u0027 he said in a liquid voice, \u0027but we can\u0027t give you anything for the pain that might mask the symptoms of the head injury. As soon as they\u0027ve finished with these lacerations, we\u0027re taking you for a CAT scan.¡¯ \" \u0027I didn\u0027t do this to myself,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m not insane. You won\u0027t find any lesions in my temporal lobe. Mark my word. I\u0027m miserable right now, but I\u0027m not crazy.¡¯ \"He looked at me intently and for a long moment, and then he said, \u0027They told me you were eighteen, is that right?¡¯ \" \u0027Just about nineteen,\u0027 I said. \u0027Does eighteen and a half mean anything?¡¯ \"He smiled. \u0027Yes, I suppose it does,\u0027 he said. \u0027We won\u0027t be looking for seizures or lesions now. We\u0027re looking for bleeding from the wound that\u0027s causing your headache. We\u0027re going to be waking you up if you fall asleep. Now I\u0027m going to get out of the way, and I\u0027ll see you after the CAT scan.¡¯ \" \u0027You\u0027re a neurosurgeon, right?\u0027 I said. I wanted to hold on to him. \u0027Well, I swear to you that what I saw didn\u0027t come from my brain and I don\u0027t want you to cut a piece out of it. I\u0027d rather rave in a padded cell than have that happen.¡¯ \"Two orderlies, or at least that\u0027s what I thought they were, had come to take me away, but he gestured for them to wait. \" \u0027Tell me yourself,\u0027 he said, \u0027what happened to you.¡¯ \" \u0027This stranger, this man who\u0027d been trespassing on a swamp hermitage on our property -- he got into my bedroom in spite of the guards around our house, and he dragged me out of bed, pulled me into the bathroom, banged my head against the wall and cursed at me and threatened me.¡¯ \"I stopped. I didn\u0027t want to tell him about Goblin. Some deep instinct told me not to tell him about Goblin. But that instinct didn\u0027t stop me from silently summoning Goblin, and, quite suddenly, Goblin stood at the foot of the gurney, still looking extremely solid and vividly colored, which was amazing after his ordeal, and he shook his head in a firm negation. \" \u0027There was broken glass,\u0027 I said, \u0027from the lavatory mirror and the shower door. I think I got a few scrapes, nothing more than that.¡¯ \" \u0027How did this intruder drag you from bed?\u0027 Dr. Winn asked. \" \u0027By my arms.¡¯ \"Dr. Winn looked at both my arms. They were black and blue now. He studied them thoughtfully. \"Dr. Winn then asked me to lean forward so he could see the back of my head. I did, and I felt his amazingly gentle fingers touching a huge bump there. His touch sent a tingling all through me. \"Again, Goblin shook his head No. Don\u0027t tell him about us. He will hurt me. \" \u0027Do you believe me now?\u0027 I asked. \u0027That I didn\u0027t do this to myself?¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, yes, I believe you completely,\u0027 he said. \u0027None of your injuries are self-inflicted. For a variety of reasons it\u0027s quite impossible for them to have been self-inflicted. But we\u0027ve got to get that CAT scan.¡¯ \"I was immensely relieved. \"The CAT scan was a relatively simple ordeal, which revealed that there was no bleeding inside of my head and that my brain was not swelling, and immediately after Dr. Mayfair confirmed these results I was wheeled to a fairly lavish suite consisting of a living room and two bedrooms. One bedroom was mine. Aunt Queen was setting up shop in the other one. Jasmine, who had gone home for her clothes, was already back but would soon have to leave again. \"I promised to leave the IV alone and to cooperate with everything if the restraints were removed, and Dr. Mayfair agreed to this readily. \" \u0027There are guards on the door, aren\u0027t there?\u0027 I asked. \"Aunt Queen confirmed that there were. A uniformed police officer was right down the hall. And Clem was in the parlor. \"I could see that Aunt Queen had been crying. But even more distressing to me was the fact that she still wore her feathered negligee. She hadn\u0027t had time to change. I felt bitterly angry and at the same time frightened. \" \u0027You know, this is a strange situation, my Little Boy,\u0027 she said as she came to sit by my bed. (Goblin was hovering in the corner.) \u0027We have two possible explanations for what happened tonight and either one is monstrous.¡¯ \" \u0027Believe me, there\u0027s only one explanation,\u0027 I said, \u0027and this man is a threat!\u0027 I then confessed to her how I had burnt the stranger\u0027s books and how this had provoked him. \u0027He\u0027s an eccentric, I can vouch for that by the cut of his handsome black clothes and his long hair, but he\u0027s strong as an ox, and Goblin gave him a terrific scare. He didn\u0027t know what was hitting him or where the glass was coming from.¡¯ \"I stopped. I realized I had told her all this in the car. I had told her over and over. Was she listening to me now because Dr. Winn had said my wounds weren\u0027t self-inflicted? \"She was deeply troubled. I wanted to be strong for her, not weak, not in a hospital bed. I picked up the small control pad for the bed and cranked it so that I could sit up. \"Dr. Winn came in to take his leave. \u0027The CAT scan\u0027s fine,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027And in the next few days we\u0027ll run some more tests. All you have to do, Quinn, is stay in bed. I\u0027ll be talking to you later this morning.¡¯ \" \u0027Doctor,\u0027 I said, \u0027would I try your patience if I asked you a question?¡¯ \" \u0027No, not at all, what is it?¡¯ \" \u0027There was a brilliant premed student; a friend of mine. She\u0027d been accepted into a research project here. She died as the result of a traffic accident. I wonder if you knew her.¡¯ \"A change came into his calm face that was very eloquent of suffering. \u0027You\u0027re speaking of Lynelle Springer,\u0027 he said. \"I nodded. \" \u0027You\u0027re the boy she taught, the boy she talked so much about, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Of course. Tarquin Blackwood, her pride and joy. She loved you the way she loved her own children.¡¯ \"I swallowed. I was about to cry. I hadn\u0027t expected this much of an answer. \u0027Is it true?\u0027 I asked, \u0027that after the accident she never regained consciousness? She never knew how badly she was hurt?¡¯ \" \u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 he said. He spoke in a humble voice, a voice that was reverent. \u0027We had her here for two weeks. Her daughters came. They played tapes for her of music and poetry readings,\u0027 he said. \u0027But she was down too deep and her injuries were too great. Everything was done that could be done, and then she left us.¡¯ \"I felt immeasurable relief knowing all this. I felt like some key chapter in my life was finally closed so that it could remain with me in its entirety now without a host of little distractions. I also felt sure this man wouldn\u0027t lie to me -- ever -- about anything. \"Aunt Queen inundated me with kisses and told me she was going to get dressed. \"Fr. Kevin Mayfair came into the room and sat down beside me. Goblin, who still stood solidly at the end of the bed, eyed him suspiciously. \" \u0027So what do you want me to say?\u0027 I asked Fr. Kevin. \u0027They\u0027ve probably told you all I told them. They\u0027ve told you that Goblin rescued me. You know Goblin. Goblin comes to Mass with me every Sunday.¡¯ \" \u0027Don\u0027t be so scared of me, Quinn,\u0027 he said, his tone firmer and a little higher in timbre than that of Dr. Winn. \u0027I\u0027m not the enemy. I\u0027m not here to haul you up before the Spanish Inquisition. Your housekeeper, Ramona, she saw all this flying glass. If I\u0027d seen it, maybe I\u0027d never doubt Almighty God again. Maybe the Devil can do that for us.¡¯ \" \u0027It wasn\u0027t the Devil in that bathroom,\u0027 I said. \u0027It was an angry man, a tall, good-looking, vain man. He got past the guards and yanked me right out of sleep. And then Goblin, my Goblin\u0027 -- I looked at him at the foot of the bed and saw him anxiously eyeing Fr. Kevin -- \u0027my Goblin, he broke the glass to drive the man away from me. He sent the glass flying at the man and the man couldn\u0027t see Goblin any more than you can. The man didn\u0027t know what was happening. You\u0027ve got to understand, Goblin isn\u0027t from the Devil. There has to be some in-between kind of spirit that\u0027s neither devil nor angel. There has to be.¡¯ \"Fr. Kevin nodded. \u0027Maybe you\u0027re right,\u0027 he said, to my surprise. He looked off for a moment in an almost dreamy way, then back to me. I found him distractingly handsome. It wasn\u0027t just the true red hair and the green eyes, it was the alert expression and the excellent proportions of his face, the shortness of the nose and the length of his full mouth. His voice was kind. \" \u0027Two years ago,\u0027 he said, \u0027or maybe less, I wouldn\u0027t have believed you. But now? Since coming South I\u0027ve heard so much of ghosts and family curses that I\u0027m more flexible of mind and disposition.\u0027 He paused. \u0027But I\u0027ll tell you this. Whether they come from the Devil or inside our brains, whether they\u0027re ghosts or disembodied beings with no true origin, spirits don\u0027t do us any good. I\u0027m sure of it.¡¯ \"Goblin was becoming agitated. He was staring at Fr. Kevin with a cold hate. \" \u0027No, Goblin,\u0027 I said. \u0027Don\u0027t do anything, Goblin.\u0027 In a sudden fit of alarm, I looked around. There was a mirror above the lavatory. What if he broke it into fragments? He knew he could do this now! \"Goblin, the Learner. \"Goblin looked at me with the strangest smile, as if to say, Don\u0027t you think I know better? \" \u0027Listen, he\u0027s here,\u0027 I said to Fr. Kevin. \u0027You can\u0027t see him but he\u0027s at the foot of the bed. And it\u0027s rude to him to speak in his presence as if he were evil. He isn\u0027t evil. How he became attached to me, I don\u0027t know. Maybe he was just drifting, drifting and looking for someone who could see him, and then I came along, a child who had the gift. And we made our little brotherhood, him and me. I have no answers. But he saved me tonight. He saved me with an extraordinary show of strength. He broke the glass, not me, and I don\u0027t want him to think for one moment that I am ungrateful.¡¯ \"Fr. Kevin studied me intently throughout this speech and then he nodded. \u0027Well, let\u0027s leave it at this. If you need to talk to me, you call me. I\u0027ve given my number to your Aunt Queen, and I\u0027m in and out of Mayfair Medical doing rounds every day. I\u0027m fast becoming the full-time chaplain here, and you\u0027d be surprised what Dr. Rowan wants me to investigate. I\u0027ll stop back in later to see you.¡¯ \" \u0027What does she want you to investigate?\u0027 I asked. I was plenty intrigued. And I was simmering down, and I liked talking to him. He wasn\u0027t the clich¨¦ I\u0027d expected him to be. \" \u0027Near-death experiences,\u0027 he said, \u0027that\u0027s what I\u0027m investigating. You know, when people are pronounced dead and they see a bright light when they pass through a tunnel and greet a being of light -- and then they\u0027re revived and they come back here to tell us about it.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, I know. I read everything on that subject that I can find. I believe in it. I believe it happens.¡¯ \" \u0027Often those people aren\u0027t believed,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m here to believe, but never to ask a leading question or maybe make a suggestive statement.¡¯ \" \u0027I follow you,\u0027 I said. \u0027Have you talked to people who\u0027ve had the experience?¡¯ \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027I have. Of course I give the Sacrament for the Sick too. And I hear confessions, and I bring Communion.¡¯ \" \u0027Do you believe me -- what I\u0027ve just told you?¡¯ \" \u0027I believe you believe what you\u0027re saying,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now do you want the Sacrament for the Sick? You know it doesn\u0027t require much of one.¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027m not sick,\u0027 I replied, \u0027and as to my sexual sins, well, I\u0027m not ready to give all that up. I can\u0027t go to Confession just now. I can\u0027t take Communion. Sex is brand-new to me.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said with a weary little smile, \u0027it\u0027s difficult at your time of life.\u0027 He shrugged. And then he flashed a brighter smile on me and said, \u0027I thought it was Hell when I was your age, and frankly I think so sometimes now. Priests go to Confession, you know. They go to other priests. It\u0027s not so easy.¡¯ \" \u0027I like you. I know that may not matter much --.¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, yes, it matters,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I have to get back to St. Mary\u0027s. I have my parish duties as well as some work later at the university. I\u0027ll see you this afternoon.¡¯ \"He stood up. \"Something flashed into my head. \u0027Father,\u0027 I said, \u0027what if you do see a ghost that\u0027s evil, a ghost that leads you into harm, a ghost who wants some kind of dark vengeance? What do you do? You make the Sign of the Cross and you pray? Is that your only weapon?¡¯ \"He looked at me for a long time before he answered. Then he said, \u0027Don\u0027t talk to it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t entertain it with talk or looks or any form of attention. Remember, it can\u0027t do much to you without your helping it. Just maybe it can\u0027t do anything to you without your helping it. Take the ghost of Hamlet\u0027s father, for instance. Suppose Hamlet had never gone to meet it and spoken to it. Suppose he had never given the ghost an opportunity to put a story of murder into his mind. The result was pure destruction for innocent and guilty. Think on it. What if Hamlet had refused to speak to that ghost?¡¯ \" \u0027You mean the ghost was evil?\u0027 I asked. \" \u0027The play tells us so,\u0027 he said. \u0027It could be named The Damnation of Hamlet.¡¯ \"I nodded. \"He left the room and I lay there, getting sleepy and woozy and thankful that Goblin now took the chair by the bed, and I took his hand in mine. \"I thought of the malicious stranger. \u0027Who was that bastard, Goblin?\u0027 I asked. \u0027How did he get in my room?¡¯ \"When I heard no telepathic answer I turned and looked at him, and I saw that same grave expression on his face that I had remarked down in the cemetery, after I\u0027d buried the remains of Rebecca. \" \u0027Can\u0027t you talk to me, Goblin?\u0027 I said. \u0027Listen, I\u0027ll have them bring me paper and crayons tomorrow-a big sketchpad, you know-and we can write to each other.¡¯ \"He shook his head. He almost sneered. He did sneer. He looked cold and then angry. Computer, Quinn, bring a computer here. \" \u0027Of course,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Why didn\u0027t I think of that? I\u0027ll get a laptop, I\u0027ll tell them I have to have it.¡¯ \"I was getting sleepier and sleepier. He sat there, my guardian, and then he spoke to me telepathically again. Anger makes me strong, Quinn. \" \u0027Anger\u0027s bad,\u0027 I murmured. I was drifting off. I woke with a start, then reminded myself that I was safe. Aunt Queen came in. I heard her telling the nurse that I was falling asleep. They had to wake me up. \"I heard Jasmine at my ear: \" \u0027Little Boss, listen to me,\u0027 Jasmine said, \u0027we\u0027re booked solid at the Manor for the next two weeks. I have to go on back home again and so does Mamma. We have no choice. But Miss Queen is all set up. And the guards are outside. Don\u0027t you worry on that account. I\u0027ll be back when I can.¡¯ \" \u0027Kiss me,\u0027 I murmured. I was falling asleep. \"Was it sleep? Rebecca and I were on the lawn again in the big wicker peacock chairs and the sun was slanting down on the zinnias that Pops had planted all along the side of the house, and Rebecca said in a rippling, rhythmic voice, \u0027Oh, of course I\u0027d like to live in a civilized fashion and pretend it all never took place, that he married me and made me mistress of this house and that my children would have been loved by him, and you know that you always had love, you always had love, you don\u0027t know what it means to not have love, to have nothing, simply nothing, and you, with Jasmine, you didn\u0027t taken any measures, and what if a child came from that union, would you love that child, the child you had with that colored bitch!¡¯ \"I tried to wake up. I had to ask Jasmine. Could she have gotten pregnant, but then it seemed dreamlike that I\u0027d been with her, and I feared she\u0027d be mean to me if I brought it up, and I knew she hadn\u0027t taken measures and neither had I, and maybe there could be a baby, and it almost made me happy. \"I couldn\u0027t move my hands. \"I opened my eyes. They had tied my hands to the bed! \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 I tried to say more but Rebecca was talking. They had tied my feet. I began to shout for help. \"Aunt Queen stood over me: \u0027Quinn, darling, you ripped out the IV. You were talking out loud to someone. You were agitated. You pushed the intern away. He has to put the IV back.¡¯ \"This was too terrible, simply too terrible. I looked at the ceiling tiles. To get away, to get far away, I went into unconsciousness. And of course Rebecca was there, she was pouring coffee for me and smiling, and the marguerites were blooming with the zinnias, and I loved the marguerites so much, those little white-and-yellow daisies. \" \u0027You\u0027ve got to find a way to get out of here,\u0027 I told Rebecca. \u0027You have got to find a way to escape this place and go into the Light. God\u0027s waiting for you. God knows what\u0027s happened to you, he knows about the hook, he knows what they did. Don\u0027t you understand that it\u0027s God who\u0027s going to give you justice?¡¯ \"(\u0027Wake up, Quinn. Quinn, wake up.\u0027) \" \u0027And why should I go when it\u0027s so nice here,\u0027 Rebecca said. \u0027Here, look, this is the blouse you found upstairs in the trunk. Big Ramona\u0027s been washing and ironing all my clothes just like you told her to do. I wore this specially for you, and you see my cameo? How pretty it is. It\u0027s Venus with the little cupid at her side. I took it from Aunt Queen\u0027s display. Oh, I just love being with you. Have some more coffee. What are you going to do with all my old clothes?¡¯ \"(\u0027Wake up, Quinn, come on, open your eyes.\u0027) \" \u0027What am I going to do with you is more the question,\u0027 I replied, \u0027and I\u0027m telling you, you\u0027re going home to God. We all do. It\u0027s just a matter of time.\u0027 \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-19.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
