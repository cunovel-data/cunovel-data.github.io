{"id":96940,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"33 \"IT WAS about nine a.m. when I called Stirling, and, unable to contain myself, spilled out all of the story of recent events, as I invited him to dinner to discuss them in greater detail. Perhaps I wanted him to know this was a loaded invitation. I thought it only fair. \"He surprised me. He insisted that we meet for lunch. He asked if it wouldn\u0027t be too inconvenient if we gathered at twelve noon. I went down to see Aunt Queen immediately. And finding her already awake, sitting up in her chaise lounge, watching a movie, saying her Rosary and eating strawberry ice cream, I was happy to have her agreement to lunch right away. \"Would Stirling come to Blackwood Manor? Of course. \"As Blackwood Manor was booked solid, we set up the small table in Aunt Queen\u0027s room, and her bed was dressed in its finest satin along with a broad collection of her red-cheeked boudoir dolls, all got up in the flapper attire that Aunt Queen herself so much adored. \"Stirling arrived promptly at five minutes before twelve, though his flowers, a huge vase of pink roses, arrived before him, and we gathered in Aunt Queen\u0027s room for Jasmine\u0027s finest veal scallopini and pasta and white wine. Nash, who offered several times to absent himself, joined us, and to my amazement Aunt Queen started right in with the \u0027strange tale\u0027 of Petronia and how she or he -- it varied during the story because at times Aunt Queen had seen Petronia differently -- had arrived at Blackwood Manor with the gift of the cameos, which were then produced for Stirling\u0027s inspection. \"Now this was the first time that I had seen these priceless pieces myself, and priceless they were. Because they were not cameos in the sense that we think of them, that is, ornaments carved from contrasting strata of shell or stone. They were portraits carved from gems, and in this case the gems were large amethysts and emeralds of Brazilian origin, and whereas amethysts are no longer very expensive gems, due to the discovery of such a supply of them in the New World, emeralds are expensive. And the carving of these small heads, each obviously of a particular Roman deity, was excellent if not absolutely magnificent. \"They were four in number, these gifts, and Aunt Queen had of course been incredibly grateful for this tribute, and then I had come home and pitched the gathering into confusion, as she was sure I was willing to explain. \"I did explain. I started at the beginning. I explained everything. I ate veal and pasta and guzzled white wine, forgetting to blot my lips before drinking and thereby going through two and three wineglasses before remembering, but I was passionately pouring out my tale, beginning with Rebecca and her visions and how they had driven me to the island, and what I had seen there in the moonlight, and how things had spun out from there, and how in a rage I had burnt the trespasser\u0027s books, and how he or she had come at me, and on it went. I left out nothing. \"Jasmine brought plate after plate of veal and pasta for me. I was happy to devour it. \" \u0027So there you see it,\u0027 I said. \u0027And then you have Goblin saying \"Evil, Quinn,\" in my ear, and then that shock when I take Petronia\u0027s hand, that feeling of something like electricity that reaches out for Goblin and travels through Goblin to me! And this thing, this being, this creature, this interloper who threatens me, he can\u0027t see Goblin but he knows that Goblin is there. He knows Goblin can send showering glass at him, and for all his speed and strength, he doesn\u0027t want to be cut.¡¯ \"At last I came to a halt. I knew Aunt Queen and Nash were watching me. I knew they were watching Stirling as well. \" \u0027No,\u0027 said Stirling quietly. He had finished his meal in spite of many many pauses in which he had stared at me with rapt attention. \u0027It doesn\u0027t want to be cut.¡¯ \" \u0027Do you say \"it,\" on account of her ambiguous sexuality?\u0027 asked Nash politely. There was some subtle tension between Nash and Stirling. I couldn\u0027t figure it. \" \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Stirling. \u0027I hope not. But who knows? Let me say, she does not want to be cut.¡¯ \" \u0027Do you believe my nephew?\u0027 Aunt Queen asked. \u0027Does all of this make any sense to you?\u0027 She was very kind in her tone. She sat to my right and pressed my shoulder softly as she spoke. \u0027My nephew is prepared for what you have to say.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, I am prepared,\u0027 I said. \u0027I know you to be a frank and truthful person. Michael and Rowan respect you. Mona respects you. I know what I see in you. Tell me what you believe.¡¯ \" \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Stirling. He took another swallow of his wine and set the glass aside. \u0027Let me advise you first as if you were my son. Go away now. Take the trip with your Aunt Queen that she wants you to take. No, don\u0027t be upset with me. Let me explain. Mona Mayfair is sick. But she may get sicker. The time to leave Mona is now. You will obviously write to her, call her, stay in touch with her. And when and if she takes the turn for the worse, perhaps with your aunt\u0027s permission you can come home.¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, absolutely,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027I think that\u0027s a very sensible way of looking at it, and we can ascertain from Dr. Winn Mayfair whether or not he agrees. We can talk to Dr. Rowan Mayfair. And of course, Quinn, you\u0027ll speak to Mona herself.¡¯ \" \u0027Now, let me explain further,\u0027 said Stirling. \u0027I think you should leave on this trip at once. I think you should get away from Petronia. I think you should leave tonight if you can, and if not tonight then tomorrow, and if not tomorrow the day after that. But go. And go quickly, and in the meantime, have all the refurbishments done to the Hermitage on the island, exactly as the creature has insisted, but never, and I mean, never, have a workman on Sugar Devil Island after dark.¡¯ \" \u0027Well, that\u0027s no problem,\u0027 I said hastily. \u0027These guys come on at six a.m. and they want to be home in front of the television with a beer in hand by four o\u0027clock in the afternoon.¡¯ \"But my speedy rejoinder hadn\u0027t taken the edge off Aunt Queen\u0027s response to this last remark on the part of Stirling, as I had hoped. \" \u0027You\u0027re saying that everything Quinn saw. . . happened?\u0027 she asked. \" \u0027Yes, I am saying that,\u0027 said Stirling. \u0027He\u0027s sane; if he testified in a court of law, I\u0027d believe him. I believe him here and now.¡¯ \" \u0027Stirling Oliver,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027are you telling me that the swamps hereabouts are infested with vampires?¡¯ \" \u0027No, I\u0027m not telling you that, Mrs. McQueen, because if I did, you\u0027d think me mad and disregard everything else that I told you. Let\u0027s just say that Petronia is a creature of nocturnal habits and accustomed to having Sugar Devil Island to herself. Now, one night when she thought herself to be alone, she was caught up short by the landlord, and consequently began a game of cat and mouse with him, and has been his enemy ever since.¡¯ \" \u0027You do believe all this,\u0027 Aunt Queen said. \" \u0027Oh, definitely. But the important thing is this. Do what the creature wants right now. Refurbish the Hermitage. And remove Quinn from the vicinity. Take the trip to Europe. And expect to have big long-distance phone bills in every hotel. This young man is very much in love with Mona Mayfair, that I know full well from what I saw with my own eyes.¡¯ \" \u0027I don\u0027t know what to say to you, Mr. Oliver,\u0027 Aunt Queen responded. She was discouraged. But I was overwhelmingly glad to be believed, though not to leave Mona for a moment. \" \u0027Mrs. McQueen,\u0027 said Stirling. \u0027It is best that Quinn leave here with you now, you know that. The refurbishing of the island can well take place without him, and if he never sees Petronia again, all the better for him, surely you agree.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, I do.¡¯ \" \u0027Then forgive me for this, but I\u0027m going to say something to you which is going to make it simpler for Quinn to come to his decision. Please believe that I use this power respectfully.¡¯ \" \u0027Which power is this?¡¯ \" \u0027The same one Petronia claimed to have,\u0027 said Stirling, \u0027and when I came into this room today I used it, accidentally as always, unwillingly as always. But I couldn\u0027t help but know that your doctor had been here earlier, and he had told you that this trip to Europe would have to be your very last.¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, dear,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027I didn\u0027t want Quinn to know.¡¯ \" \u0027But I should know!\u0027 I said at once. I was chilled to the bone. \u0027Aunt Queen, we\u0027re going! I had no idea the doctor was here. I just have to discuss this with Mona; Mona will understand everything.\u0027 My heart ached. \"Jasmine appeared out of nowhere at this opportune moment and declared with full authority, \u0027That doctor said there should be no trip to Europe, that\u0027s what he said! And then Aunt Queen said she was going and then that doctor said this trip had to be her last, that\u0027s what happened here this morning, I know because I heard!¡¯ \" \u0027We\u0027ll go,\u0027 I declared. \u0027We\u0027ll all go together, and we\u0027ll stay as long as we can.\u0027 Oh my precious Mona, what else can I do? \" \u0027It\u0027s the best thing,\u0027 said Stirling. \u0027You asked me to come here, to listen to these stories, and I tell you, based on all I\u0027ve heard, including this unforgivable little mental eavesdropping, that you should take Quinn away from here, away from Petronia\u0027s temper and whims and go. You have a great prize to give your nephew in this trip. Give it to him while you can. And give it to yourself. You deserve to have this great gift from him.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, that\u0027s so true, Aunt Queen,\u0027 I said. \u0027Stirling, you\u0027re a magician with words. You\u0027ve teased out the truth of it. We\u0027re going. I only need to talk to Mona.¡¯ \" \u0027Well, I think this is a marvelous resolution,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027but I\u0027m still left with questions. Stirling, you speak as if you know of Petronia --.¡¯ \" \u0027No, I know nothing of her. I\u0027ve never heard her name. I was judging from your story. All the elements were there to drive me to my conclusion that her tastes were nocturnal. Why else would she have agreed to split the usage of the Hermitage with Quinn, he for day, and she for night, were she not fond of the swamp after dark when few people like it save those who hunt for alligators, I suppose? As for the rest of her habits, she seems vicious and violent, and Quinn showed an enormous amount of courage in confronting her. I would imagine she left here very surprised last night.¡¯ \" \u0027She looked triumphant,\u0027 I said. \u0027She\u0027d made me out to be a lunatic.¡¯ \" \u0027But you\u0027re not a lunatic,\u0027 said Stirling. \" \u0027No, you\u0027re not,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027I\u0027m immensely relieved. You\u0027re not. But Stirling, you speak of her as though she\u0027s a species of creature.¡¯ \" \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to do that,\u0027 he said. \u0027That was unwise of me. I meant to disclose a feeling of impersonality by using that word, I suppose. As I said, I was trying to judge purely from the things you told me. I believe she\u0027s a menace to Quinn and she\u0027ll keep toying with him if you remain here. The important thing is to go away.¡¯ \" \u0027Nash, what do you think?\u0027 Aunt Queen asked. \"Of course Nash demurred. It wasn\u0027t really his place to comment, but Aunt Queen pressed him, as he had met Petronia and he had witnessed some of what had gone on. \" \u0027Quinn seems more than sane,\u0027 Nash explained in his deep commanding voice. \u0027I have to agree. As to the trip to Europe, I think it\u0027s a marvelous idea. Now, Petronia, I must say that her theories on reincarnation gave me pause. She claimed herself to have lived in ancient Pompeii as we have discussed, and she spoke of witnessing the eruption of Vesuvius, and I must confess that I experienced a faint, what would you call it, a faint. . .¡¯ \" \u0027Disorientation,\u0027 I said immediately. \" \u0027Yes, exactly, I experienced a disorientation while she was talking, as though she were a hypnotist. It wasn\u0027t entirely comfortable. And it left me with a feeling of confusion that I didn\u0027t much like. I would never have mentioned it, except that you\u0027ve asked me. But I can say in conclusion that Petronia seemed otherwise to be charming and perhaps, perhaps a little sly.¡¯ \" \u0027How so sly?\u0027 asked Aunt Queen. \" \u0027When a person hypnotizes a whole room, yet never acknowledges it, there is a slyness there,\u0027 said Nash. \u0027Don\u0027t you think?¡¯ \"I was very impressed with these statements. I had expected Nash to claim neutrality, and I loved him now more than ever before. \"Lunch was concluded, but not before I had eaten all the veal and pasta on Goblin\u0027s plate, with his respectfully requested permission, and Jasmine and Big Ramona cleared away both dishes and table so that we could sit and talk. \"Aunt Queen made the necessary calls to set our plan in motion. Nash averred that his suitcase had never been unpacked. And tipsy as I was, I asked if I could drive Stirling around Blackwood Farm to show him the old pastures and a little bit of the swamp that one could see from the road. Before we would drive I would take him down to the cemetery to see the tombs and the old church. \"I could see that neither Nash nor Aunt Queen wanted me to be alone with him, but they couldn\u0027t very well object to it, and as soon as we were alone, headed down to the cemetery, I understood quite fully why. \" \u0027Listen to me,\u0027 Stirling said. \u0027I don\u0027t want to frighten your Aunt Queen or say things to her that will make her suspect my sanity as she now suspects yours. But I believe completely that you saw this creature dumping bodies in the swamp and I mean every word of it when I ask you to promise that you will never, never return to Sugar Devil Island at night.¡¯ \" \u0027You\u0027ve got my promise,\u0027 I said. \u0027If it hadn\u0027t been for Rebecca\u0027s dream, I would never have been there in the first place.¡¯ \" \u0027That is a story unto itself,\u0027 he said, \u0027and for now I can\u0027t comment on it, but reaffirm your promise to me and never waver, and from now on, please keep in touch with me. Realize that I am your good friend.¡¯ \"We had reached the tombs and I showed him Rebecca\u0027s headstone. Of course he knew the full story. We went into the little chapel. I was distressed to see so many leaves. I would have to tell Allen to sweep it out. \" \u0027I\u0027m the man of this place now,\u0027 I said, my voice echoing off the limestone walls. \u0027I\u0027ll have to run it from Europe. That won\u0027t be an easy feat.¡¯ \" \u0027I have another promise I want from you,\u0027 he said, looking out the door, as if to make certain no one was coming up on us. \u0027If you do see this creature again, try not to think of anything that she can read from your mind. I know this is obvious, but try to use definite techniques to cleanse your mind of anything important. You wouldn\u0027t want her finding out, for instance, as I have this very afternoon, that you have a new relation by the name of Tommy Harrison whom you\u0027ve come to like -- if not love -- in a brief meeting yesterday morning.¡¯ \"I was shocked. I wasn\u0027t conscious of having thought of Tommy. \" \u0027You give that fodder to Petronia,\u0027 Stirling said, \u0027and she\u0027ll use it against you, the same way she might use Mona. And believe me when I tell you that it\u0027s a good thing Aunt Queen will soon be beyond her apparent reach as well.¡¯ \"I shuddered. \u0027Aunt Queen,\u0027 I whispered. Then I remembered the way that Petronia had taken her leave of Aunt Queen and the words she\u0027d spoken: You\u0027ve been very gracious to me. I won\u0027t forget it. \" \u0027I wish I had this gift for reading minds,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027d know what you\u0027re holding back.¡¯ \" \u0027It isn\u0027t such a great gift,\u0027 he said as we walked on up the slope towards the house again. \u0027You can\u0027t take Tommy to Europe with you, can you?\u0027 he asked. \" \u0027Oh, that would be splendid. I don\u0027t see why not. I bet Terry Sue would allow it. Not with Brittany of course. That\u0027s the little girl. She\u0027s the workhorse. But Tommy. Tommy\u0027s the dreamer who reads books in the woods. I\u0027ll talk to Aunt Queen about it.¡¯ \" \u0027Whatever you do, try not to do it after nightfall. If you must make plans, and certainly you must, do it in New Orleans. Do it perhaps at the Grand Lumini¨¨re Caf¨¦ in Mayfair Medical. That ought to give you time to see Mona. She\u0027ll be in the center all day today and into the evening. I\u0027m meeting her and Michael and Rowan there for dinner myself.¡¯ \" \u0027You know, I like your outspoken manner but it amazes me, the ease with which you make your suggestions. Again, I know you\u0027re holding something back.¡¯ \" \u0027Know this, and I mean it from the heart. I hold back what I think I should hold back and nothing more than that. Take your Aunt Queen and Nash to dinner at the Grand Lumini¨¨re Caf¨¦ tonight. Heed my advice on that.¡¯ \" \u0027But why is it so important?¡¯ \" \u0027Because creatures like Petronia don\u0027t like witches. And they never go where they are.¡¯ \"I was dumbstruck. I couldn\u0027t quite imagine what he meant. \" \u0027She\u0027s a mind reader, no? And a trickster on top of it, wouldn\u0027t you say?¡¯ \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 I answered. \" \u0027Take my word for it,\u0027 he replied. \u0027She\u0027ll never get within a hundred yards of Mayfair Medical. Rowan Mayfair would know she was prowling in an instant. So would Mona.¡¯ \" \u0027But what do you mean when you say they\u0027re witches, Stirling?¡¯ \"We walked on to the Mercedes, which was parked in the shed. I opened the door for him and then came around to the driver\u0027s side. \"He waited for me to back the car out and head down the road. I crossed in front of the house, turned right and went down the long pecan-tree drive. \" \u0027A witch to those of us in the Talamasca,\u0027 he explained, \u0027is a mortal man or woman who can see spirits and manipulate them, bring up spirits and exorcise them, communicate with them and control them, talk to them and hear their talk.¡¯ \" \u0027Then I\u0027m a witch,\u0027 I said, \u0027on account of Goblin.¡¯ \" \u0027Very much more than likely,\u0027 he said. \u0027Though I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve experienced all the aspects I just explained.¡¯ \" \u0027No, I haven\u0027t. But I think that I could. And if Rebecca comes back, my powers of exorcism may be taxed.¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027ll be here for you if you need me. I don\u0027t think Rebecca will tempt you anyplace but here.¡¯ \" \u0027Is that the way it is with ghosts?¡¯ \" \u0027Some of the time,\u0027 he said. \u0027It depends on the type of haunting. Sometimes a person is haunted, sometimes a place. Do you yourself know whether Goblin\u0027s a spirit or a ghost?¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, most surely a spirit,\u0027 I said. \u0027He knows nothing of where he came from or where he goes when he leaves me. There\u0027s no life for him except in my consciousness. He\u0027s probably with us right now.¡¯ \"I made an attempt to feel his presence, and I felt the answering grip of his hand on my shoulder and saw his face in the rearview mirror. He was very near me, of course. \" \u0027I love you, old buddy,\u0027 I said to him. \"I saw his poker face break into a childish grin. \" \u0027You don\u0027t know how much I\u0027ve needed you, old buddy,\u0027 I said to Goblin. \u0027These last twenty-four hours have been mad.\u0027 It was marvelous seeing that grin. \"Stirling smiled. \"During the rest of our time alone Stirling told me about the Talamasca, pretty much reinforcing what Mona had explained to me -- that they had existed for centuries, that they had vast libraries pertaining to the supernatural, that they had a huge history of Mona\u0027s family -- confidential of course. \" \u0027Ah, but you see, I am a Mayfair,\u0027 I said, \u0027am I not? Oncle Julien told me I was, remember?¡¯ \" \u0027You have a good point there. But you don\u0027t have time for Mayfair history right now. You have your own adventures. You\u0027re going off on an odyssey. Have you made up your mind about little Tommy?¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027m totally for it. Can\u0027t wait to ask Aunt Queen. But I have a question for you,\u0027 I said. \u0027What is your honest opinion of Nash?¡¯ \" \u0027A wonderful man, brilliant, very well-read, very refined. He\u0027ll be a marvelous teacher and guide for you in Europe. Don\u0027t you think so yourself?¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, but I sensed something between you, that you didn\u0027t like each other. Was I wrong?¡¯ \" \u0027You were right to sense something,\u0027 he said. \u0027He doesn\u0027t like me. He suspects my motives. He doesn\u0027t understand the nature of the Talamasca, and not understanding our rules and our role he thinks me guilty of a brand of self-interest. When you come home, if you and I become friends as I hope we will, maybe he\u0027ll change his mind. For now, please don\u0027t trouble yourself about it. He\u0027s an extraordinarily nice man.¡¯ \" \u0027I know what you\u0027re talking about,\u0027 I said. \u0027He feels a lot of insecurity about being attracted to men. I don\u0027t really.¡¯ \" \u0027You don\u0027t?\u0027 he asked. \" \u0027I thought you could read minds,\u0027 I said. \u0027I hope that sounded agreeable. I meant it to sound agreeable. I\u0027ve had an unusual life is what I ought to have said. I lost my virginity with Rebecca, then had fun in the shower with Goblin, then fell in love with Mona, and I\u0027m not certain what\u0027s next. If Mona will marry me I\u0027ll be happy to my dying day.¡¯ \"He didn\u0027t answer me. \" \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Do I sound too cavalier for your taste?¡¯ \" \u0027No, you don\u0027t at all,\u0027 he said. \u0027I was just thinking about Mona, and whether or not to say what came into my mind.¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, please do say it. I wish I could read it.¡¯ \" \u0027If you marry her, it\u0027s likely to be until her dying day before yours.¡¯ \" \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027No. That\u0027s not true. That\u0027s not true. Dr. Rowan Mayfair knows that\u0027s not true. They\u0027re working on it night and day. They\u0027ll reverse Mona\u0027s condition. I mean they\u0027ll halt it. They\u0027ll fix it. It\u0027s not going to be that bad. She\u0027ll probably even --\u0027 I broke off. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I said. \" \u0027You owe me no apology. I owe one to you. I shouldn\u0027t have said what I did. I thought last night you\u0027d understood what they were talking about.¡¯ \" \u0027I didn\u0027t want to understand,\u0027 I said. \u0027But I knew.¡¯ \"We talked some more about the Talamasca. \"Anytime I wanted to visit Oak Haven I was welcome. Now it was time for parting and I drove Stirling back to his car. It was a handsome brown Rolls-Royce with cream-colored upholstery. He said the Talamasca spoilt all its members with fine cars and fine furniture. \" \u0027And what do we do in return for it?\u0027 he asked rhetorically. \u0027Live like celibates and work like dogs.¡¯ \" \u0027I like you very much,\u0027 I said. \u0027Thank you for coming to lunch and thank you for standing with me.¡¯ \" \u0027I had no choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027Please call me when you can. Let me know what\u0027s happening. Here\u0027s a card for your shirt pocket and one for your jacket and one for your inside pocket too, and here, put this somewhere also.¡¯ \" \u0027Don\u0027t worry about me, Stirling,\u0027 I said. \u0027I know I\u0027m much better off on account of your advice. I\u0027m never going back out there at night, and I\u0027m going to do what I can to get everyone out of this house before nightfall.¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, and something else too, Quinn. It\u0027s very tricky, fighting a being like Petronia, but something tells me that you\u0027ve been wise in putting up a fight, in using Goblin as you\u0027ve done, and I wouldn\u0027t hesitate to do that in the future. I hope you enjoy your trip to Europe. I hope you enjoy it immensely.¡¯ \"Very reluctantly, I told him good-bye, and I watched until the car had made its long slow journey down the avenue of trees and turned towards the highway. He seemed a wise man. And I wonder now if everything would have been different if I had confided in him more, trusted him more, not gone against him and everybody else in my pride and impetuosity.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-33.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
