When I bubbled over crazily with the horrible dream of the piercing of Rebecca, Sheriff Jeanfreau just laughed at me, laughed at my references to myself as both man and woman in the dream, and only a sudden expostulation of\n \" \u0027Please!\u0027 from Aunt Queen shut him up.\n \"When it came to my depiction of the mysterious stranger dumping the two bodies, Sheriff Jeanfreau started laughing again and there even came some audible snickering from his worthless deputy Ugly Henderson.\n \"Patsy, who had come into the kitchen sometime during the proceedings, picked up on Ugly\u0027s snickering and started some snickering of her own.\n \"And when I described how Goblin had led me back out of the swamp, the sheriff, figuratively speaking, rolled on the floor.\n \"I ignored all this with first-rate patience, devoured two plates of pancakes made by Big Ramona from the Cracker Barrel pancake mix and looked to Aunt Queen.\n \" \u0027You know Rebecca was murdered out there, Aunt Queen. All I\u0027m asking is that somebody go out there and collect the remains and test them for DNA!¡¯\n \" \u0027Oh, Quinn, my precious darling,\u0027 \" Aunt Queen sighed.\n \"As for Pops, it was well past his bedtime, and he looked like he\u0027d been rode hard and put away wet. I knew what a worry I was to him.\n \"THEN the snapshots came back from the drugstore! THE SNAPSHOTS!\n \"And round the kitchen table I passed them like so many playing cards. They were good shots too. You couldn\u0027t tell much about Rebecca\u0027s remains from the shots, but you could easily see the five rusted chains; and of course the outdoor shots of the Hermitage itself, and the mausoleum, were very good.\n \" \u0027Now you know damned good and well,\u0027 I said, \u0027that there\u0027s a house out there, you can\u0027t deny it; and if that metal there\u0027 -- I jabbed my finger at the photograph -- \u0027isn\u0027t pure gold, then my name\u0027s not Blackwood.¡¯\n \"The sheriff was in the midst of another belly-jiggling fit of laughter when Aunt Queen gestured for quiet.\n \" \u0027All right,\u0027 she declared. \u0027We\u0027ve heard all Quinn has to say. Now, this island is real and he knows the way to it, and according to him these mysterious bodies were dumped at a spot some matter of yards beyond the banks of the island. In other words, he can take you to the very place from which he spied the dumping and a search of that small area would be entirely manageable.¡¯\n \"The sheriff couldn\u0027t stop himself from laughing. \u0027Now, Miss Queen,\u0027 he said, \u0027you know how much I admire you, as does everybody in these parts. . .¡¯\n \" \u0027Thank you, Sheriff,\u0027 she at once responded. \u0027On New Year\u0027s Eve I shall expect a tribute of seven youths and seven maidens, handpicked of course.¡¯\n \"Now it was my turn to die with laughter, because I knew this referred to the minotaur myth, but he hadn\u0027t a clue of that and only stared at me and then at her, and I was just stupid enough at eighteen to feel superior to him.\n \"Aunt Queen went on without missing a beat, ignoring my exultation.\n \" \u0027Now, I will personally pay,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027for the bagging and collecting of these chains and the black residue which Quinn has described. I will pay to have it thoroughly and completely analyzed as to its substance, and will go so far as to run DNA tests on it to determine, among other things, whether or not only one person perished in this spot, or more than one, and whether or not Rebecca Stanford -- whose hair we have conveniently in a hairbrush in the attic -- did indeed die in this place.\u0027 She paused for effect, her eyes narrowing.\n \" \u0027All I ask of you, Sheriff,\u0027 she continued in a high matriarchal fashion, \u0027is that you go back out there and you look for these mysterious bodies. I assume you and Pops can go by motorized pirogue in the morning.¡¯\n \" \u0027The motors will never make it,\u0027 I piped up. \u0027We\u0027ll have to take the small pirogue, same as I did. The cypresses are just too dense.¡¯\n \" \u0027Very well then, Pops knows how to handle the pole and I assume you do too, Sheriff Bobby Jeanfreau! So you take care of that, and consider yourself solemnly charged to find those bodies, while the labwork I will handle through my own personal physician, assuming that Ruby River City doesn\u0027t have a medical examiner on its payroll who is qualified in the field.¡¯\n \"At this point, the sheriff, having been laughed at by me, very smoothly smiled and asked:\n \" \u0027And may I deputize Goblin, ma\u0027am, so he can show Pops and me the way to the island?¡¯\n \"Now it was Pops who became riled, though his tone was low and pretty much apathetic, given the state of things.\n \" \u0027We don\u0027t need for you to deputize Goblin,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I do think that you need a real team of people out there, not just to find those bodies but to examine this death scene with the chains, this residue as we\u0027re calling it; you need somebody to look to that in an official way.¡¯\n \" \u0027Now, Pops, you know there\u0027s nothing to all this --\u0027 the sheriff countered. He was as stubborn as I\u0027d ever seen him, and as ignorant, too.\n \"But Pops pressed on, his tone never changing except in terms of the contents of what he said. \u0027Now you listen to me, Sheriff,\u0027 he stated calmly. \u0027A body out there even on the second floor of a house could decompose within a few years. And it is possible that Quinn has stumbled upon the scene of a crime, and he might have stumbled on the criminal himself. I\u0027m insisting you take a team of men out there, and if you don\u0027t I\u0027ll call in the FBI.¡¯\n \"Why this struck utter terror into the sheriff I\u0027m not sure, but given some of the rumors of what went on in Ruby River Parish, including the cock fighting (which isn\u0027t illegal in Louisiana, by the way), I guessed he didn\u0027t want the FBI snooping around, so he agreed to the terms.\n \"In spite of Pops trying to restrain me I followed the sheriff all the way to his car, hammering on him about those two bodies: \u0027You\u0027ve got to check and see who\u0027s missing! I\u0027m telling you, I saw it. Two bodies, just dumped out there. You\u0027ve got to search.¡¯\n \" \u0027One thing at a time,\u0027 Pops said finally. \u0027Let them check out the house. And then if you think you can pinpoint the place where this stranger dumped the bodies, then we\u0027ll insist on a search.¡¯\n \"Finally the sheriff and his snickering deputy were gone from the property, and Aunt Queen and Pops had ahold of me and told everybody else to leave the kitchen so we could be alone.\n \"Patsy was pretty ticked off that she couldn\u0027t stay, but Pops gave her one of the worst glowering looks I\u0027ve ever seen on his face, and she finally retreated, in a sulk, to her apartment over the shed.\n \"A bitter lecture came from Pops as to my having disobeyed Aunt Queen by going out there by myself, about my having \u0027stolen\u0027 his pistol, and some strong statements about how I was in real danger from myself now, and it was time for me to leave Blackwood Farm and go out into the world.\n \" \u0027What do you mean \"out into the world\" ?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Can\u0027t you see these pictures! There\u0027s this gold tomb out there, Pops, I\u0027ve got to find out what\u0027s in it, and then there\u0027s the house itself. I\u0027m not going anywhere. Pops, you know what I want to do,\u0027 I went on, full throttle. \u0027I want to run electricity out there to that house, you know, run the cables right through the swamp. I want to clean it up and make it livable again, a real Hermitage, but I can\u0027t do that until they collect and analyze Rebecca\u0027s remains. I can\u0027t do that until I\u0027ve done right by Rebecca, even though if truth be told Rebecca doesn\u0027t always do right by me.¡¯\n \"He looked sad and tired, moving slowly to exasperation.\n \"But I kept at him.\n \" \u0027And they have to catch this stranger,\u0027 I said, \u0027this murderer, this miscreant who is dumping bodies in our swamp.¡¯\n \"There came a final change in Pops, a change I\u0027d seen many times in the past. He became angry, angry with me, the way I\u0027d seen him with Patsy.\n \" \u0027You\u0027re getting titched in the head, son,\u0027 he said. \u0027You need to get clear of here. You can enroll at LSU in Baton Rouge if you want to stay close to home, but I\u0027m for you going up East to Harvard. Aunt Queen\u0027s looked over all the material given her by Lynelle on your schooling and your examinations, and you could easily get into an Ivy League school right now. You\u0027re going out of here.¡¯\n \" \u0027My darling,\u0027 Aunt Queen said, \u0027Pops is absolutely right. You have to think now of your future in the world and not the mysteries and histories of those who once lived in this house. This house will be here for you all your life. But you are at an age now when impressions mean everything, and it\u0027s time for you to get away.¡¯\n \"I went silent. I had met with total resistance. I wondered if the gators could eat those bodies so quickly that there would be nothing left. I wondered if I could pinpoint the place on the island where I\u0027d been standing when I saw the dastardly deed.\n \" \u0027You go to bed, Quinn,\u0027 said Aunt Queen gently. \u0027I know you saw something out there. I don\u0027t doubt you. And clearly the Hermitage exists. You\u0027ve brought back proof of it. But it\u0027s late, and nothing can be done until morning.¡¯\n \"Upstairs, I found Big Ramona in my wing chair by the cold fireplace with her rosary beads in her hand. Her full white hair was already braided. She was in her best rose-flowered flannel nightgown. She gave me a big hug and I went in to shower and change.\n \"After we said our night prayers and I let it be known I was too damned tired for a whole Rosary, we were soon snuggling spoon fashion and I was remembering that mysterious stranger in the weak light of the broken moon.\n \"Then I heard the computer switched on. A low green light emanated from the monitor.\n \"What a nuisance, I thought. \u0027Goblin, why do you do these things?\u0027 I murmured, but then I heard a strange sound. It was the clicking of the computer keys.\n \"I shot up out of bed and came into this parlor and stared at the computer. He had most certainly typed out a message:\n QUINN, DANGER EVERYWHERE; I\u0027M AFRAID.\n \"I was stultified. Never had he done this before. Turn it on and off, yes, but to write on it without my hand? I sat down at the computer and I wrote out the words as I recited them aloud:\n \" \u0027Goblin, I love you. I couldn\u0027t have come home without you. Explain what you mean about danger.¡¯\n \"I moved my hands away from the keyboard and watched the rapid, seemingly magical depression of the keys as he wrote out:\n I SEE IT NEAR AND FAR. GO AWAY. I LOVE YOU. DON\u0027T LOVE REBECCA.\n \"I began to whisper my response to him, that is, to talk aloud to him as I had always done -- that he needn\u0027t worry -- when the keys started firing again, and I saw the writing on the screen:\n THROUGH THE COMPUTER, QUINN. I AM STRONG IN THE ELECTRICITY, NOT STRONG NOW IN ANY OTHER WAY. TOO TIRED FROM SWAMP. QUINN, GO.\n \"This all but dumbfounded me, but it fitted with my growing understanding of him, and so I hammered out:\n \" \u0027Goblin, who was the stranger? Who were the bodies?¡¯\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 came his answers. \u0027The bodies were dead.¡¯\n \"That was a typical example of Goblin\u0027s reasoning. For a long breathless moment I sat there, and then I typed out: \u0027Goblin, I love you. Don\u0027t ever think that I don\u0027t love you. Put up with me and my off-and-on ways.¡¯\n \"There came no answer, and then, before I could hit the save button to preserve this little dialogue, the computer switched itself off. Or rather Goblin switched it off.\n \" \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 I said aloud, looking about me. But no answer came from the darkness. There was nothing to be done but to go back to bed. . .\n \"And to lie there, awake, pondering all that had happened, including the fact that Goblin could now write on the computer without using my left hand to do so -- a frightening discovery, though one which was all bound up in my head with the awareness that he had led me out of the swamp.\n \"In summary, what I mean is I felt guilty for how shabbily I\u0027d treated Goblin.\n \"Goblin had my admiration again, the way he had gotten it when I was a little boy and he taught me to spell big words. Goblin and I were close again. Goblin knew I was telling the truth. Goblin understood everything.\n \"I felt it excitedly while at the same time rejecting totally his message. We were close, that\u0027s what mattered.\n \"But we were to come even closer.\n \"Sometime during the night, as Big Ramona snored and I dozed in a half sleep, dreaming of Rebecca, there came into the room a stranger.\n \"Goblin, with a hand on my shoulder, awakened and alerted me. Sleeping on the left side of the bed I was turned to my left, and I opened my eyes to see Goblin staring past me in the direction of the fireplace. There came the tight squeeze from Goblin which on the island had meant caution.\n \"I rolled over as if it were merely natural in my sleep.\n \"I could see the figure at the mantel, and measuring it by that marker I calculated it was a tall man -- and I knew by its outline that it was no man I knew, but its shape conformed with the shape of the man I\u0027d seen in the swamp in the moonlight.\n \"I could see the outline of a bold head, well squared-off shoulders, and the glint of a hand on the mantelpiece. I was certain it was the same man! There came a tapping sound from the mantelpiece. There was something white on the mantelpiece.\n \"And then there came a low utterance of laughter.\n \"I climbed out of bed lickety-split, though Goblin tried with all his effort to stop me. And as I rushed across the room in my bare feet I heard the sound of paper crumpled and I picked out of the shadows the sight of a white paper ball tossed into the fireplace.\n \"Before I took another step the man had vanished.\n \"My eyes searched the room. I rushed through the open doorway only to find the hallway empty. Attic and ground floor revealed nobody.\n \"All the guests of Blackwood Manor slept and so did its residents. And from the kitchen window I could see Clem, the night man, in the brightly lighted shed, sitting back with his feet up, watching the television.\n \"My heart was racing.\n \"What was the point of sounding an alarm? Who would believe me this time? I went back up to my room and I retrieved the crumpled paper from the fireplace. I knew what it was before I read it. It was my letter to the trespasser of Sugar Devil Island, warning him to get off the property.\n \"I straightened it out and turned it over. There was no response written on it. Then I remembered the tapping on the mantelpiece, and sure enough there was a letter there, or at least a piece of folded white paper.\n \"I was incalculably excited! Here was the smoking gun. I snatched up this paper with literally trembling hands and took it to my desk where I turned on my small halogen lamp in hopes of not awakening Big Ramona.\n \"The white paper was thick and fancy, and the writing was in script of a florid and large design. I could smell the India ink in which it had been written. This is an approximation of what it said:\n Tarquin, my beloved boy,\n I am not as amused by your notice as one might expect. On the contrary, I rather resent your intrusion into a portion of Sugar Devil Swamp to which I hold unwritten title, thanks to the generosity and foresight of your great-great-great-grandfather Manfred. If I had not set eyes on you tonight and not recognized you for the sensitive and serious young man which you are, I might take even greater umbrage than I do.\n As it stands, allow me to explain that I want the island undisturbed by you, and it is my express wish that none of you or your family come there. I treasure my privacy, Tarquin, perhaps more than you treasure your life. Think on it, my boy.\n The Resident of the Hermitage.\n \"I folded the letter, and, without bothering with a robe or slippers any more than I had during my earlier perambulation, I went downstairs to Aunt Queen\u0027s bedroom. I pushed open the door with a child\u0027s license.\n \"The light was on of course, and Aunt Queen was on her chaise lounge, swaddled in diamonds and satin covers, eating a pint of pink ice cream.\n \"Jasmine, who was bunking in with her, lay sound asleep in the bed.\n \"From the television there came the muted voices of Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland.\n \" \u0027Tarquin,\u0027 Aunt Queen said at once, \u0027what is it?\u0027 She muted the murmuring television. \u0027You look like you\u0027ve seen Banquo\u0027s ghost. Come here and kiss me.¡¯\n \"I kissed her more than willingly.\n \" \u0027He\u0027s come into my room, Aunt Queen,\u0027 I said breathlessly, waving the letter in her face. \u0027And he\u0027s left me this note. I saw him, Aunt Queen. He stood at my fireplace. Goblin told me he was there. And this is the note which he\u0027s left me. Aunt Queen, I tell you something involving murder is afoot out there. And mad as it may sound it\u0027s some sort of secret Byronic society.¡¯\n \" \u0027Let me see this letter,\u0027 she said. She set her ice cream aside. Meanwhile Jasmine had raised her head and was sliding out from under the blankets.\n \"I told them both what had transpired upstairs. Jasmine then read the note, and Aunt Queen read it a second time. I was too excited to do anything but pace.\n \" \u0027We\u0027ve got to start locking the front and back doors,\u0027 Jasmine said, \u0027if people are going to come just walking right in without knocking.¡¯\n \" \u0027We don\u0027t lock the front and back doors?!\u0027 I asked, appalled.\n \" \u0027No, you know we don\u0027t,\u0027 said Jasmine. \u0027The guests come back at all hours from New Orleans. You ever had a key to the front or back door, Tarquin Blackwood?¡¯\n \" \u0027This guy laughed at me,\u0027 I said as calmly as I could, which wasn\u0027t calm at all. \u0027He laughed, I tell you. I heard him laugh and. . .\u0027 I stopped. It was the laughter I heard in those dizzy spells. It was the laughter that had accompanied Rebecca\u0027s piteous pleas. Oh, but who would ever believe that!\n \" \u0027Tarquin, what is it!\u0027 Aunt Queen pressed. \u0027Don\u0027t stand there staring. Jasmine, go run and tell Clem to check the entire property. Tell Clem we\u0027ve had an intruder. Hurry.¡¯\n \"Jasmine headed out.\n \" \u0027Tarquin, stop staring like that,\u0027 said Aunt Queen. \u0027There has to be a reason for this, I mean something that makes sense here. Maybe you\u0027ve hit it. It is a secret society that meets out there, you know, a sort of romantic clandestine thing, and one of them has come into this house, which you know is open at all times, you know, and he has dared to go upstairs. . .\"\n \" \u0027There\u0027s nothing romantic about dumping dead bodies,\u0027 I said.\n \" \u0027Darling, maybe he was dumping something else, and it just looked that way.¡¯\n \"I turned around in a small circle. I saw the faint outline of Goblin by one post of the fancy bed. Goblin nodded to me vigorously.\n \"I looked at her. She was looking past me to the place where Goblin stood.\n \" \u0027They were dead bodies, Aunt Queen,\u0027 I said. \u0027I know because Goblin knows and Goblin is afraid.¡¯\n \"A deep silence fell over her, and then she looked up at me. \u0027My sweet boy,\u0027 she said. \u0027I shall have this investigated in every conceivable way, make no mistake on it. But I am going to get you out of here.\u0027 \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-14.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
