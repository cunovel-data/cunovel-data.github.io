Lestat was lingering in the cemetery saying some last prayer for Merrick, or to Merrick, I wasn\u0027t sure which.\\n\\n Our hunting last night in Boca Raton had been marvelous and he had once again given me the gift of his all-powerful blood and I was exhilarated and confused and praying in my own way for some sign of what to do about Mona, wondering if I could just see her and talk to her; if I went to Mayfair Medical and insisted, could I perhaps use some spellbinding power to get to where she was? One last glimpse. . . one last talk.\\n\\n But suddenly Jasmine and Clem both came rushing up to me at the foot of the stairs.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a crazy woman in your bedroom,\" said Jasmine. \"There was nothing we could do to stop her, Quinn. It\u0027s Mona Mayfair, you remember her? She\u0027s up there, Quinn. She drove here in a limousine full of flowers, Quinn, and she\u0027s a living skeleton, you\u0027re gonna die when you see her. Quinn, wait, we couldn\u0027t stop her. Only reason we helped her with all those flowers is she was so weak.\"\\n\\n \"Jasmine, lemme go!\" I shouted. \"I love her, don\u0027t you understand?\"\\n\\n \"Quinn, she\u0027s got something wrong with her! Be careful!\"\\n\\n I ran up the stairs as fast as any mortal man dared and rushed into my bedroom and slammed the door shut and locked it.\\n\\n She rose up to greet me. A living skeleton! Oh yes! And the bed was covered with her flowers. I stood there shocked to the core of my being, shocked and so glad to see her, so glad to rush to her and take her fragile form in my arms! My Mona, my frail and withering Mona, my pale and magnificent Mona, oh, my God, don\u0027t let me hurt you.\\n\\n \"I love you, my beloved Ophelia,\" I said, \"my Ophelia Immortal, and mine always. . .\"\\n\\n Oh, look at the roses, the marguerites, the zinnias, the lilies.\\n\\n \"Noble Abelard,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027ve come to ask the ultimate sacrifice; I\u0027ve come to ask, let me die here, let me die with you here, let me die here instead of there with their needles and their tubes, let me die in your bed.\"\\n\\n I drew back. I could see the entire outline of her skull beneath her skin, and the bones of her shoulders underneath the spotted hospital gown that she wore. Only her full red hair had been spared. Her arms were like sticks, and her hands were the same. It was ghastly, the sight. She suffered with every breath.\\n\\n \"Oh, my darling, my sweetheart, thank God you came to me,\" I told her, \"but can\u0027t you see what\u0027s happened to me? Can\u0027t your witch\u0027s eyes see? I\u0027m not human anymore. I\u0027m not your Noble Abelard. I don\u0027t sleep where the rays of the sun can reach me. Look at me, Mona, look at me. Do you want to be what I am?\" What was I saying? I was mad. I couldn\u0027t stop myself. \"Do you want to be what I am?\" I asked again. \"Because you won\u0027t die if you want to be what I am! If you\u0027ll live off the blood of others forever. You\u0027ll be immortal with me.\"\\n\\n I heard the lock of my door turn. I was outraged, then silenced. It was Lestat who entered.\\n\\n Mona stared in astonishment. He had removed his sunglasses, and he stood under the gasolier as if he was bathing in its light.\\n\\n \"Let me work the Dark Trick, Quinn,\" he said. \"That way, you\u0027ll be much closer to your princess. Let me take her for you with my strong blood, and that way your minds won\u0027t be closed to each other. I\u0027m a past master at such Dark Tricks, Quinn. Mona, would you know our secrets?\" He came to her. \"Make your choice, pretty girl. You can always choose the Light some other night, cherie. Ask Quinn if you doubt it. He\u0027s seen it. He\u0027s seen the Light of Heaven with his own eyes.\"\\n\\n She clung to me while he talked to her, pacing the floor, back and forth, telling her so many things -- how it was with us, the rules, the limitations, the way he violated the rules and the limitations, the way the strong and the old survived, the way the new ones went into the flames. On and on he talked, and she clung to me, my Ophelia in her nest of flowers, with her legs so fragile and her whole little body trembling, oh, sweet Ophelia Immortal.\\n\\n \"Yes. I want it,\" she said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-52.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \\n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
