And unlike many a rogue invader whom you have already dispatched, I understand your reasons. You don\u0027t want us to be seen by members of the Talamasca. You don\u0027t want a war with the venerable Order of Psy\\n\\n chic Detectives, both for their sake and ours.\\n\\n But please, I beg you, before you come in search of me, read what I have to say.\\n\\n My name is Quinn. I\u0027m twenty-two years old, and have been a Blood Hunter, as my Maker called it, for slightly less than a year. I\u0027m an orphan now, as I see it, and it is to you that I turn for help.\\n\\n But before I make my case, please understand that I know the Talamasca, that I knew them before the Dark Blood was ever given to me, and I know of their inherent goodness and their legendary neutrality as regards things supernatural, and I will have taken great pains to elude them in placing this letter in your flat.\\n\\n That you keep a telepathic watch over New Orleans is plain to me. That you\u0027ll find the letter I have no doubt.\\n\\n If you do come to bring a swift justice to me for my disobedience, assure me please that you will do your utmost to destroy a spirit which has been my companion since I was a child. This creature, a duplicate of me who has grown with me since before I can remember, now poses a danger to humans as well as to myself.\\n\\n Let me explain.\\n\\n As a little boy I named this spirit Goblin, and that was well before anyone had told me nursery rhymes or fairy tales in which such a word might appear. Whether the name came from the spirit himself I don\u0027t know. However, at the mere mention of the name, I could always call him to me. Many a time he came of his own accord and wouldn\u0027t be banished. At others, he was the only friend I had. Over the years, he has been my constant familiar, maturing as I matured and becoming ever more skilled at making known to me his wishes. You could say I strengthened and shaped Goblin, unwittingly creating the monster that he is now.\\n\\n The truth is, I can\u0027t imagine existence without Goblin. But I have to imagine it. I have to put an end to Goblin before he metamorphoses into something utterly beyond my control.\\n\\n Why do I call him a monster -- this creature who was once my only playmate? The answer is simple. In the months since my being made a Blood Hunter -- and understand, I had no choice whatsoever in the matter -- Goblin has acquired his own taste for blood. After every feeding, I am embraced by him, and blood is drawn from me into him by a thousand infinitesimal wounds, strengthening the image of him, and lending to his presence a soft fragrance which Goblin never had before. With each passing month, Goblin becomes stronger, and his assaults on me more prolonged.\\n\\n I can no longer fight him off.\\n\\n It won\u0027t surprise you, I don\u0027t think, that these assaults are vaguely pleasurable, not as pleasurable to me as feeding on a human victim, but they involve a vague orgasmic shimmer that I can\u0027t deny.\\n\\n But it is not my vulnerability to Goblin that worries me now. It is the question of what Goblin may become.\\n\\n Now, I have read your Vampire Chronicles through and through. They were bequeathed to me by my Maker, an ancient Blood Hunter who gave me, according to his own version of things, an enormous amount of strength as well.\\n\\n In your stories you talk of the origins of the vampires, quoting an ancient Egyptian Elder Blood Drinker who told the tale to the wise one, Marius, who centuries ago passed it on to you.\\n\\n Whether you and Marius made up some of what was written in your books I don\u0027t know. You and your comrades, the Coven of the Articulate, as you are now called, may well have a penchant for telling lies.\\n\\n But I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m living proof that Blood Drinkers exist -- whether they are called Blood Drinkers, vampires, Children of the Night or Children of the Millennia -- and the manner in which I was made conforms to what you describe.\\n\\n Indeed, though my Maker called us Blood Hunters rather than vampires, he used words which have appeared in your tales. The Cloud Gift he gave to me so that I can travel effortlessly by air; and also the Mind Gift to seek out telepathically the sins of my victims; as well as the Fire Gift to ignite the fire in the iron stove here that keeps me warm.\\n\\n So I believe your stories. I believe in you.\\n\\n I believe you when you say that Akasha, the first of the vampires, was created when an evil spirit invaded every fiber of her being, a spirit which had, before attacking her, acquired a taste for human blood.\\n\\n I believe you when you say that this spirit, named Amel by the two witches who could see him and hear him -- Maharet and Mekare -- exists now in all of us, his mysterious body, if we may call it that, having grown like a rampant vine to blossom in every Blood Hunter who is made by another, right on up to the present time.\\n\\n I know as well from your stories that when the witches Mekare and Maharet were made Blood Hunters, they lost the ability to see and talk to spirits. And indeed my Maker told me that I would lose mine.\\n\\n But I assure you, I have not lost my powers as a seer of spirits. I am still their magnet. And it is perhaps this ability in me, this receptiveness, and my early refusal to spurn Goblin, that have given him the strength to be plaguing me for vampiric blood now.\\n\\n Lestat, if this creature grows ever more strong, and it seems there is nothing I can do to stop him, is it possible that he can enter a human being, as Amel did in ancient times? Is it possible that yet another species of the vampiric root may be created, and from that root yet another vine?\\n\\n I cannot imagine your being indifferent to this question, or to the possibility that Goblin will become a killer of humans, though he is far from that strength right now.\\n\\n I think you will understand when I say that I\u0027m frightened for those whom I love and cherish -- my mortal family -- as well as for any stranger whom Goblin might eventually attack.\\n\\n It\u0027s hard to write these words. For all my life I have loved Goblin and scorned anyone who denigrated him as an \"imaginary playmate\" or a \"foolish obsession.\" But he and I, for so long mysterious bedfellows, are now enemies, and I dread his attacks because I feel his increasing strength.\\n\\n Goblin withdraws from me utterly when I am not hunting, only to reappear when the fresh blood is in my veins. We have no spiritual intercourse now, Goblin and I. He seems afire with jealousy that I\u0027ve become a Blood Hunter. It\u0027s as though his childish mind has been wiped clean of all it once learned.\\n\\n It is an agony for me, all of this.\\n\\n But let me repeat: it is not on my account that I write to you. It is in fear of what Goblin may become.\\n\\n Of course I want to lay eyes upon you. I want to talk to you. I want to be received, if such a thing is possible, into the Coven of the Articulate. I want you, the great breaker of rules, to forgive me that I have broken yours.\\n\\n I want you who were kidnapped and made a vampire against your will to look kindly on me because the same thing happened to me.\\n\\n I want you to forgive my trespass into your old flat in the Rue Royale, where I hope to hide this letter. I want you to know as well that I haven\u0027t hunted in New Orleans and never will.\\n\\n And speaking of hunting, I too have been taught to hunt the Evil Doer, and though my record isn\u0027t perfect, I\u0027m learning with each feast. I\u0027ve also mastered the Little Drink, as you so elegantly call it, and I\u0027m a visitor to noisy mortal parties who is never noticed as he feeds from one after another in quick and deft moves.\\n\\n But in the main, my existence is lonely and bitter. If it weren\u0027t for my mortal family, it would be unendurable. As for my Maker, I shun him and his cohorts, and with reason.\\n\\n That\u0027s a story I\u0027d like to tell you. In fact, there are many stories I want to tell you. I pray that my stories might keep you from destroying me. You know, we could play a game. We meet and I start talking, and slap damn, you kill me when I take a verbal turn you don\u0027t like.\\n\\n But seriously, Goblin is my concern.\\n\\n Let me add before I close that during this last year of being a fledgling Blood Hunter, of reading your Chronicles and trying to learn from them, I have often been tempted to go to the Talamasca Motherhouse at Oak Haven, outside of New Orleans. I have often been tempted to ask the Talamasca for counsel and help.\\n\\n When I was a boy -- and I\u0027m hardly more than that now -- there was a member of the Talamasca who was able to see Goblin as clearly as I could -- a gentle, nonjudgmental Englishman named Stirling Oliver, who advised me about my powers and how they could become too strong for me to control. I grew to love Stirling within a very short time.\\n\\n I also fell deeply in love with a young girl who was in the company of Stirling when I met him, a red-haired beauty with considerable paranormal power who could also see Goblin -- one to whom the Talamasca had opened its generous heart.\\n\\n That young girl is beyond my reach now. Her name is Mayfair, a name that is not unfamiliar to you, though this young girl probably knows nothing of your friend and companion Merrick Mayfair, even to this day.\\n\\n But she is most certainly from the same family of powerful psychics -- they seem to delight in calling themselves witches -- and I have sworn never to see her again. With her considerable powers she would realize at once that something catastrophic has happened to me. And I cannot let my evil touch her in any way.\\n\\n When I read your Chronicles, I was mildly astonished to discover that the Talamasca had turned against the Blood Hunters. My Maker had told me this, but I didn\u0027t believe it until I read it in your books.\\n\\n It\u0027s still hard for me to imagine that these gentle people have broken one thousand years of neutrality in a warning against all of our kind. They seemed so proud of their benevolent history, so psychologically dependent upon a secular and kindly definition of themselves.\\n\\n Obviously, I can\u0027t go to the Talamasca now. They might become my sworn enemies if I do that. They are my sworn enemies! And on account of my past contact, they know exactly where I live. But more significantly, I can\u0027t seek their help because you don\u0027t want it.\\n\\n You and the other members of the Coven of the Articulate do not want one of us to fall into the hands of an order of scholars who are only too eager to study us at close range.\\n\\n As for my red-haired Mayfair love, let me repeat that I wouldn\u0027t dream of approaching her, though I\u0027ve sometimes wondered if her extraordinary powers couldn\u0027t help me to somehow put an end to Goblin for all time. But this could not be done without my frightening her and confusing her, and I won\u0027t interrupt her human destiny as mine was interrupted for me. I feel even more cut off from her than I did in the past.\\n\\n And so, except for my mortal connections, I\u0027m alone.\\n\\n I don\u0027t expect your pity on account of this. But maybe your understanding will prevent you from immediately annihilating me and Goblin without so much as a warning.\\n\\n That you can find both of us I have no doubt. If even half the Chronicles are true, it\u0027s plain that your Mind Gift is without measure. Nevertheless, let me tell you where I am.\\n\\n My true home is the wooden Hermitage on Sugar Devil Island, deep in Sugar Devil Swamp, in northeastern Louisiana, not far from the Mississippi border. Sugar Devil Swamp is fed by the West Ruby River, which branches off from the Ruby at Rubyville.\\n\\n Acres of this deep cypress swamp have belonged to my family for generations, and no mortal ever accidentally finds his way in here to Sugar Devil Island, I\u0027m certain of it, though my great-great-great-grandfather Manfred Blackwood did build the house in which I sit, writing to you now.\\n\\n Our ancestral home is Blackwood Manor, an august if not overblown house in the grandest Greek Revival style, replete with enormous and dizzying Corinthian columns, an immense structure on high ground.\\n\\n For all its huffing and puffing beauty, it lacks the grace and dignity of New Orleans homes, being a truly pretentious monument to Manfred Blackwood\u0027s greed and dreams. Constructed in the 1880s, without a plantation to justify it, it had no real purpose but to give delight to those who lived in it. The entire property -- swamp, land and monstrous house -- is known as Blackwood Farm.\\n\\n That the house and land around it are haunted is not only legend but fact. Goblin is without a doubt the most potent of the spirits, but there are ghosts here as well.\\n\\n Do they want the Dark Blood from me? For the most part, they seem far too weak for such a possibility, but who is to say that ghosts don\u0027t see and learn? God knows that I have some accursed capacity to draw their attention and to endow them with some crucial vitality. It\u0027s been happening all my life.\\n\\n Have I tried your patience? I hope to God that I have not.\\n\\n But this letter may be my one chance with you, Lestat. And so I\u0027ve said the things that matter to me most.\\n\\n And when I reach your flat in the Rue Royale, I\u0027ll use every bit of wit and skill at my command to place this letter where no one will find it but you.\\n\\n Believing in that ability, I sign my name,\\n\\n Tarquin Blackwood,\\n\\n known always as\\n\\n Quinn\\n\\n Postscript.\\n\\n Remember I\u0027m only twenty-two and a bit clumsy. But I can\u0027t resist this small request. If you do mean to track me down and eradicate me, could you give me an hour\u0027s notice to say some sort of farewell to the one mortal relative I most love in all the world?\\n\\n In the Vampire Chronicle called Merrick, you were described as wearing a coat with cameo buttons. Was that the truth or someone\u0027s fanciful embellishment?\\n\\n If you wore those cameo buttons -- indeed, if you chose them carefully and you loved them -- then for the sake of those cameos, let me, before being destroyed, say farewell to an elderly woman of incredible charm and benevolence who loves each evening to spread out her hundreds of cameos on her marble table and examine them one by one in the light. She is my great-aunt and my teacher in all things, a woman who has sought to endow me with all I need to live an important life.\\n\\n I\u0027m not worthy of her love now. I\u0027m not alive now. But she doesn\u0027t know this. My nightly visits to her are cautious but nevertheless crucial to her. And should I be taken from her without warning and without some explanation, it would be a cruelty she doesn\u0027t deserve.\\n\\n Ah, there is much more that I could tell you about her cameos -- about the role which they have played in my fate.\\n\\n But for now, let me only plead with you. Let me live, and help me destroy Goblin. Or put an end to us both.\\n\\n Sincerely,\\n\\n Quinn \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-1.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \\n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
