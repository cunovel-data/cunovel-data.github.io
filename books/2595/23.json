{"id":96930,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"23\n \"WHAT BROUGHT ME out of my daze about the newfound uncle and Pops\u0027 wealth was the view of all the old wicker, painted white and grouped on the side flagstone terrace to the right of Blackwood Manor, just as it had been in my dreams of Rebecca. This was furniture I\u0027d requisitioned from the attic, but the task of restoration had been completed while I lay in the hospital, and I marveled now to see the gathering of couches and chairs just as it had been when Rebecca served me her mythical coffee.\n \" \u0027Mona\u0027s going to understand,\u0027 I murmured aloud, \u0027and that man, that kindly man, Stirling Oliver, he\u0027ll understand, and then there\u0027s Nash, Nash who seemed as great and kind as a teacher could be, Nash who gave me hope that I would get through this strange time with some equanimity.¡¯\n \"But when he entered the front hall I was stunned to see a pile of luggage by the door, and Nash, in a blue suit and tie, with a hand out for my shoulder.\n \" \u0027I can\u0027t stay, Quinn, but I must talk to your Aunt Queen before I talk to you. Let me have those moments with her now.¡¯\n \"I was devastated. \u0027No,\u0027 I said, \u0027you have to tell me. It\u0027s what I said, wasn\u0027t it, all the things I told you, you think I\u0027m insane, and you think it\u0027s going to be like this always, but I swear --.¡¯\n \" \u0027No, Quinn, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re insane,\u0027 he said. \u0027But understand I must leave. Now let me speak with Miss Queen alone. I promise I won\u0027t leave without telling you.¡¯\n \"I let them go into the front parlor together, and then I went into the kitchen for lunch, where Jasmine was just telling Big Ramona that they were rich. I hated to break up their happiness with my glum looks and I blamed it all on hunger. Besides, Jasmine had always been rich and so was Big Ramona. They just never wanted to leave Blackwood Manor, everybody knew.\n \"And since one thing I could always do was eat, I devoured a platter of Sunday chicken and dumplings.\n \"Finally, I could resist the suspense no longer. I went to the parlor door, and Aunt Queen beckoned for me.\n \" \u0027Now darling, Nash is under the impression that you\u0027ll be disturbed in time by the fact that he hasn\u0027t so much chosen a bachelor\u0027s life as been rather predisposed to it.¡¯\n \" \u0027I have it all in a letter here, Quinn,\u0027 said Nash in his kindly but authoritative manner.\n \" \u0027Are you telling me you\u0027re gay?\u0027 I asked.\n \"Aunt Queen was shocked.\n \" \u0027Well, to be frank,\u0027 said Nash, \u0027that\u0027s exactly what I intended to tell you.¡¯\n \" \u0027I knew that last night,\u0027 I said. \u0027Oh, don\u0027t worry that you gave it away with some obvious gesture or mannerism. You didn\u0027t. I just sensed it because I\u0027m probably that way myself; at least, I\u0027m bisexual, I have no doubt of that.¡¯\n \"I was greeted by a stunned silence from Nash, and from Aunt Queen a low pleasant laughter. Of course I\u0027d just made a little confession that might have hurt her, but I was very sure Nash would not be hurt at all.\n \" \u0027Oh my precocious one,\u0027 she said. \u0027You never fail to charm me. Bisexual is it, how Byronic and charming. Doesn\u0027t that double one\u0027s chances for love? I\u0027m so delighted.¡¯\n \"Nash continued to stare at me as if he could think of nothing whatsoever to say, and then I realized what had happened.\n \"Nash had resigned his post not because he was gay; he\u0027d known he was gay long before he ever came here. He\u0027d resigned his post because of what he\u0027d seen in me and what I\u0027d told him about my own predilections! Oh, it was so perfectly obvious and I\u0027d been such a dolt not to catch on. I should have let him off the hook right away.\n \" \u0027Look, Nash,\u0027 I said, \u0027you\u0027ve got to stay. You want to stay and I want you to stay. Now let\u0027s just take a vow that nothing erotic will ever pass between us. That it\u0027s, you know, inappropriate. You\u0027ll become the perfect teacher for me because I don\u0027t have to hide anything from you.¡¯\n \" \u0027Now that\u0027s a potent argument,\u0027 said Aunt Queen, \u0027no pun intended. I do mean, really Nash, Quinn has a point there.\u0027 She made a pleasant airy laugh. \u0027Good Lord, in schools all over this country gay men and women make excellent and sympathetic teachers. The whole issue is settled.\u0027 She rose. \u0027Nash Penfield, you must unpack your bags, at least until we leave for New York, and Quinn, you have to get some sleep. Now everything\u0027s settled until suppertime.¡¯\n \"Nash still seemed to be in a state of shock, but I shook his hand and elicited a wide-eyed and softly murmured statement that he would stay, and, not daring to take him in my arms, I headed up to my room to get three hundred dollars out of my bureau (I always had some money there) and to make certain that I had on the best suit of clothes I owned and the lucky Versace tie, which I had not worn to meet with our lawyer.\n \"As I came downstairs I felt something pull at me; I don\u0027t mean it was the hand of Goblin so much as it was a feeling or a mass of feelings. I had gone without sleep a long long time. And what I thought of now was Rebecca. In fact, it seemed for a moment Rebecca was with me, and then she wasn\u0027t.\n Little redheaded bitch. . . black bitch!\n \"When I reached the side lawn I walked slowly over the flagstone terrace and through the new arrangement of wicker, and I had the feeling that Rebecca was very near. Rebecca was waiting for me to fall asleep. Rebecca was waiting to talk to me. Yes, I had been on this very couch with her, and she had sat on that chair, and the coffee had been on this table. A dizziness came and went as it had that day in the swamp, but I knew I had to fight it. A life for my life. A death for my death. . .\n \" \u0027What did you say?\u0027 I asked. \u0027A life for a life?\u0027 Who was I talking to? I battled the dizziness. \u0027Murderous ghost, get away from me!\u0027 I whispered.\n \"What was I doing out here on the side lawn? So they had refurbished the wicker as I told them to do.\n \"I had to be gone. I headed for the shed.\n \"And within minutes I was rolling out in Sweetheart\u0027s old Mercedes 450 sedan, the car I had always much admired, though I think it was as old as I was.\n \"I was on the highway in no time and flying towards Mona Mayfair. But there was time to swing by the florist on St. Charles and Third and buy Mona a beautiful bouquet of long-stemmed roses.\n \"Then I drove to my final destination: First and Chestnut, riverside downtown corner. Of course the house wasn\u0027t near the river. The river was a world away. The expression was just a way of orienting oneself in New Orleans.\n \"The house was quietly fabulous. It didn\u0027t have the arrogant splendor of Blackwood Manor. Rather it was a Greek Revival town house with a side-hall door, four columns up and down, its stucco walls painted a twilight lavender, and beyond to the far right a partially concealed side garden. The whole mansion was set about six steps off the ground and the steps were white marble.\n \"I parked the car across the intersection and I made the diagonal now on legs that didn\u0027t feel, they just guided, and with the huge bouquet in my arms, breathless to offer it to her.\n \"The iron fence wasn\u0027t high and there was the doorbell. I debated. What would I say to the person who answered? Mona, I\u0027m desperate to see Mona.\n \"But I didn\u0027t have to face this complexity. One half second after I appeared at the gate, the big white front door opened, and out she came, quickly closing the door behind her and rushing down the steps to the gate. She had a key for it and turned it quickly, and then we stood facing each other outside the bounds of the fence and I thought I was dying.\n \"She was about one hundred times more lovely than I remembered her. Her green eyes were much larger and she had a naturally rouged mouth that I wanted to kiss immediately. Her hair was clear red, and to cap it off she wore an exquisite white cotton shirt, unbuttoned way low, and skintight white pants that showed off her small rounded thighs beautifully. I was even in love with her toes. She had on thick sandals and I could see all her red toenails. I adored her.\n \" \u0027My God, Mona,\u0027 I said, and I took the plunge, covering her mouth with mine and grabbing for her tiny wrists, but she broke away gently and said,\n \" \u0027Where\u0027s your car, Quinn? We have to get out of here quick.¡¯\n \"We ran across the street like newlyweds running from a rice storm. We were driving out First Street towards the river in a twinkling.\n \" \u0027So where can we go? Oh, God, I don\u0027t know where we can go,\u0027 I said.\n \" \u0027I do,\u0027 she answered. \u0027You know how to get to the Quarter?¡¯\n \" \u0027Absolutely.¡¯\n \"She gave me an address. \u0027The LaFreni¨¨re Cottages,\u0027 she said. \u0027I called them this morning.¡¯\n \" \u0027But how did you know I\u0027d come? I mean I\u0027m thrilled that you called them, but how did you know?¡¯\n \" \u0027I\u0027m a witch,\u0027 she said. \u0027I knew when you left Blackwood Farm just like I know that Goblin\u0027s in the car with us. He\u0027s right behind you. You don\u0027t even know it, do you? But I didn\u0027t mean that. I meant only, I wanted you to come.¡¯\n \" \u0027You put a spell on me,\u0027 I said. \u0027I haven\u0027t slept since I saw you last, and half my night\u0027s ravings have been about you and wanting to come to you.\u0027 I could hardly keep my eyes on the road. \u0027Only lawyers and wills have kept me from you, tales of infidelity and orphan children and roaming in ghostly furniture and forging alliances as strong as the one I mean to forge with you.¡¯\n \" \u0027God, you\u0027ve got some vocabulary,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Or maybe it\u0027s just your delivery. It\u0027s meant that you should come to me. I\u0027m Ophelia always, floating in the flowery stream. I need your rushing poetry. Can you drive if I unzip your pants!¡¯\n \" \u0027No, don\u0027t do that. We\u0027ll have a wreck. I think all this is a hallucination.¡¯\n \" \u0027No, it\u0027s not. Did you bring any condoms?¡¯\n \" \u0027God, no,\u0027 I said. We had reached Canal Street. I knew where the LaFreni¨¨re Cottages were. Lynelle and I had eaten three times in their tasty little French bistro. \u0027Mona, Mona, Mona,\u0027 I said. \u0027We have to get condoms! Where?¡¯\n \" \u0027No, we don\u0027t,\u0027 she said. \u0027I have tons of them in my purse.\u0027 \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-23.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
