{"id":96931,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"24 \"THE LAFRENI¨¨RE COTTAGES WERE nestled around a central brick courtyard crowded with the de rigueur palmetto and banana trees, and in the center of the courtyard was a wishing well that may once have served some purpose. Now it was merely decorative, and people had taken to pitching all manner of change into it. \"Mona handled our check-in as if it were nothing, even telling me to put away my money, the bill would go to her family. \"When I protested she whispered, \u0027Show your strength when we get in bed.¡¯ \"And off we went, into the little flag-paved cottage, to do just that, in a modern pewter ironwork bed with an enchanting canopy of metal leaves and grapes, and a light breezy fabric wound loosely around its four corners. \"As soon as the door was latched we both stripped off our clothes with the utter abandon of beasts, and when I beheld her naked, when I saw the pinkness of her nipples and the little blaze of red hair between her legs, I went appropriately crazy. \"It was Mona who helped me on with the condom and Mona who had the presence of mind to pull down the covers, so that we didn\u0027t stain them, and finally they wound up on the floor as we went at it like little jungle animals. \"Whatever was going on with my life, I figured, I had fulfilled one of my wildest dreams, no matter that it was newborn, it was wild and from the heart and I would never never forget it. I would never forget Mona\u0027s face as she blushed with the spasm that sent me into the final explosion of pure nirvana. \"When it was over we lay together, embraced, warm, contented and kissing each other playfully and gently. \" \u0027Oh, thank God,\u0027 she whispered into my ear. She helped me with the soiled condom. She went for the towel to clean me off. She kissed me again and she said, \u0027I wanted to put my mouth on it. Come, let me wash you in the bathroom and then I\u0027ll do it.¡¯ \"I protested gallantly. I required no such sacrificial adoration! \" \u0027Tarquin, I want to!\u0027 she said. \u0027I wanted to do it in the car. I just had an overwhelming desire to do it. And I never got to do it. Come on, out of bed!\u0027 and I was led like a slave into the tiled bath where she performed the arousing ablutions and then we were back amid the swirled sheets, only she had her mouth on my cock, stroking it hard, fast, and licking at the tip, and then I died when I came. All strength, all energy, all dreams went out of me. \" \u0027Nobody\u0027s ever done that before?\u0027 she purred in my ear as we lay there. \" \u0027No,\u0027 I said. It was all I could do to speak. \u0027Could we sleep, just like this, snuggled up together?¡¯ \"In answer I felt the warm weight of the covers and then her cool arm against my back and her lips kissing my eyes. There was a moist heat coming from her breasts and from between her legs. And the breeze of the air conditioner, chilling down the room, made the nestling all the more wonderful. \" \u0027Tarquin, you are one beautiful boy,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027And your ghost is here, and he\u0027s watching us.¡¯ \" \u0027Go away, Goblin,\u0027 I said. \u0027Leave me now, or I mean it, I won\u0027t speak to you for the longest time, I swear it.\u0027 Then I turned over and looked around the room. \u0027Can you see him?\u0027 I asked her. \" \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027He\u0027s gone.\u0027 She lay back on the pillows next to me. \u0027I am Ophelia once again,\u0027 she said. \u0027I am floating in the water, with only \"nettles, daisies and long purples\" to hold me up, and I will never sink to \"muddy death.\" You can\u0027t imagine how it is with me.¡¯ \" \u0027How so?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I see you borne along forever, vital, precious, oh, so sweet --.\u0027 I tried to stay awake, to listen to her. \" \u0027Go on, sleep. Men want to sleep when it\u0027s over. Women want to talk, at least sometimes. I am Ophelia drifting in \"the weeping brook,\" so light, so sure, \"or like a creature native and endued unto that element.\" They won\u0027t find me till tonight, and maybe not even then. I tip these hotels pretty high, I think I may have them won over.¡¯ \" \u0027You mean you\u0027ve done this before? You\u0027ve come here with others?\u0027 Now I was wide awake. I rose up and propped myself on my elbow. \" \u0027Tarquin, I have a huge family,\u0027 she said, looking at me, her hair exquisitely mussed on the pillow. \u0027And one time it was my goal to be intimate with every one of my cousins. I succeeded with more than I can count without the aid of a computer. Of course it wasn\u0027t always in a hotel. It was more often in the cemetery at night --.¡¯ \" \u0027The cemetery!\u0027 I said. \u0027You\u0027re serious?¡¯ \" \u0027You have to understand that my life isn\u0027t normal. Most Mayfairs don\u0027t seek for a normal life. But my life isn\u0027t even normal for a Mayfair. And this goal, this goal of sleeping with all my cousins, it\u0027s been over for some time.\u0027 Her eyes looked suddenly sad, and she looked up at me imploringly. \u0027But yeah, I\u0027ve been here, I have to confess, I have christened this room before with my cousin Pierce, but it doesn\u0027t matter, Tarquin, it\u0027s all new with you, that\u0027s what matters. And I was never Ophelia with Pierce. I\u0027m going to marry Pierce but I\u0027ll never be Ophelia.¡¯ \" \u0027You can\u0027t marry Pierce, you have to marry me. My life\u0027s not normal either, Mona,\u0027 I said. \u0027You have no idea how strange it is and you and I are no doubt meant for each other.¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, yes, I do. I know your ghost goes everywhere with you. I know you lived all your life among adults. You have no real knowledge of children. That\u0027s what Fr. Kev told me. At least that\u0027s what I could drag out of him. I almost got Fr. Kev into bed, but in the final go-round he proved to be immovable. He\u0027s what anybody would call a good priest, but he\u0027s loosening up when it comes to gossip, though not, you understand, about anything he hears in the confessional.¡¯ \"Her eyes were so green that I could scarcely concentrate on what she was saying. \" \u0027And did he warn you off of me?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Did he tell you I was crazy?¡¯ \"She laughed a sweet laugh and she bit down on her lower lip as if she was thinking. \u0027You\u0027ve got it backwards. They\u0027re out to protect you from me. Course they do want to keep me under lock and key. That\u0027s why I was at the front door of the house waiting for you. I am now considered to be a raving slut. I had to see you before they did. And I\u0027m not the only witch in the family.¡¯ \" \u0027Mona, what do you mean when you say \"witch\" ? What are you talking about?¡¯ \" \u0027You mean you\u0027ve never heard of us?¡¯ \" \u0027Yes, but only good things -- like Dr. Rowan\u0027s dream of Mayfair Medical, and Fr. Kev and how he came South to revisit the Irish Channel where he was born, that sort of thing. We go to St. Mary\u0027s Assumption Church. We see Fr. Kev all the time.¡¯ \" \u0027I\u0027ll tell you why Fr. Kevin came South,\u0027 she said. \u0027He came South because we needed him. Oh, there\u0027s so much I wish I could tell you, but I can\u0027t. And when I saw you in the Grand Lumini¨¨re, when I saw you talking to Goblin and embracing Goblin, I thought, God, you\u0027ve answered my prayer, you\u0027ve given me someone with secrets! Only now I realize it doesn\u0027t change things with me. It can\u0027t. Because I can\u0027t tell you everything.¡¯ \"She began to cry. \" \u0027Mona, you can tell me! Listen, you can confide in me completely.\u0027 I kissed her tears. \u0027Don\u0027t cry, Mona,\u0027 I pleaded. \u0027I can\u0027t stand it, seeing you cry.¡¯ \" \u0027I don\u0027t doubt you, Quinn,\u0027 she said. She sat up in the bed, and I sat with her. \u0027I\u0027m not sure Ophelia actually cries in the play, does she? Maybe crying is what keeps people from going mad. It\u0027s just that there are things that can\u0027t be told,\u0027 she went on, \u0027and there are things that nobody can do anything about.¡¯ \" \u0027It\u0027s always been my way to tell,\u0027 I said. \u0027That\u0027s why you saw me embracing Goblin. It would have been very easy at a certain age for me to stop embracing Goblin. I could have maybe sent Goblin away to wherever he came from. But I never kept him a secret. There is a ghost who haunts me too, and then there is a stranger, the man who beat me up and put me in Mayfair Medical. I just let these things come out. I believe we have to do that.¡¯ \"I handed her the paper tissues from the bedside table. I took another and wiped at her tears. \" \u0027I know I\u0027m going to marry you, Mona,\u0027 I said suddenly. \u0027I know it. I know it\u0027s my destiny.¡¯ \" \u0027Quinn,\u0027 she said, wiping her eyes, \u0027that isn\u0027t going to happen. We can have a little while, talk to each other, be with each other like this, but we can\u0027t ever really be together.¡¯ \" \u0027But why?\u0027 I demanded. I knew that if I lost her I would regret it always. I thought that Goblin knew it. That\u0027s why Goblin had gone away with no argument. He knew this was too strong, and he hadn\u0027t said a word to me. \"Yet I remembered what Goblin could do now. Goblin could break these windows if he wanted. Goblin had told me that he liked being angry. Could I tell Mona that? Should I tell anyone that? I felt a twinge of my panic, and I hated it as unmanly. With Mona, I wanted to be manly. \" \u0027Come back with me to Blackwood Manor,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s where I live. We can stay in my room, or I\u0027ll put you in my Pops\u0027 bedroom if you want the proprieties. Pops just died. The room\u0027s all cleaned and ready. He didn\u0027t die in the room. They packaged up his personal things right away. Where\u0027s the phone? I\u0027ll tell them to get it ready. Give me your size of clothes. Jasmine will go to Wal-Mart and get whatever you need to tide you over.¡¯ \" \u0027God, you\u0027re as mad as one of us,\u0027 she said with honest amazement. \u0027I thought we Mayfairs were the only ones who did things like that.¡¯ \" \u0027Just come. Nobody in my house is going to mess with us. My Aunt Queen may have some sage advice. She\u0027s pushing seventy-nine, or so she says; sage advice is to be expected. And I have a new private teacher, Nash, but he\u0027s a perfect gentleman.¡¯ \" \u0027So you don\u0027t go to school, either,\u0027 she said. \u0027Cool!¡¯ \" \u0027No, never have, going to school never worked with Goblin.¡¯ \"I flew into action. She watched with continued amazement as I spoke on the phone to Jasmine. Petite everything, white shirts, pants, cotton underwear, a few toiletries, and away we went. \"As soon as I got behind the wheel I realized I had been awake for over thirty-six hours. I began to laugh at the way everything looked, and at the way everything was working. \" \u0027Here, let me drive,\u0027 she said. \"I was glad to give in. \"She took over like a pro and off we sped, catapulting out of the narrow French Quarter streets and on to the interstate. \"I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off her, it was positively sexy the way she drove, that somebody so delectable could drive, and when she shot those green-eyed glances at me I felt weak and overjoyed, and in that mood, that crazy, elated mood, I spoke to Goblin. \" \u0027I love her, old boy, you understand, don\u0027t you?¡¯ \"I looked into the backseat and there he was, gazing at me with that cold contemptuous expression he had adopted in the hospital. It took the breath out of me. And then came his dark monotone voice: \" \u0027Yes, and I enjoyed her very much too, Tarquin.¡¯ \" \u0027You\u0027re lying, you bastard!\u0027 I said. I wanted to choke him. \u0027How dare you say that to me? I would have felt you if you\u0027d been that close! You think you can sneak inside me!¡¯ \" \u0027Oh, he was there,\u0027 Mona said as she pushed the car past eighty-five miles an hour. \u0027I could feel him.\u0027 \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-24.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide. Blackwood Farm with its grand Southern mansion, set among dark cypress swamps in Louisiana, harbours terrible blood-stained secrets and family ghosts. Heir to them all is Quinn Blackwood, young, rash and beautiful, himself a \u0027bloodhunter\u0027 whom Lestat takes under his wing. But Quinn is in thrall not only to the past and his own appetites but, even more dangerously, to a companion spirit, a \u0027goblin\u0027 succubus who could destroy him and others. Only the unearthly power of Lestat combined with the earthly powers of the Mayfair clan could hope to save Quinn from himself and his ghosts, or to rescue the doomed girl Quinn loves from her own mortality. Shocking, savage and richly erotic, this novel with the deceptively gentle title bring us Anne Rice at her most powerfully disturbing. Here are vampires and witches, men and women, demons and a doppelganger, caught up in a maelstrom of death and destruction, blood and fire, cruelty and fate.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:50 PM"}}
