In fact, Nash Penfield, the out-of-town teacher, purchased it when he arrived, and though I wasn\u0027t to meet him until more favorable circumstances prevailed -- my decision, not Aunt Queen\u0027s -- I was grateful that he had had the wherewithal to get the appropriate machine and a long extension cord.\\n\\n \"During those three days they ran every conceivable medical test, and at the end of the ordeal it was plainly clear that I had no lesions on the temporal lobe, no indication of epilepsy and no brain tumors.\\n\\n \"I was not suffering an electrolyte imbalance and I wasn\u0027t anemic. I had no circulatory problems and I was clean of all narcotics.\\n\\n \"I had no thyroid problems or problems with my pituitary gland.\\n\\n \"The very minor swelling of my brain, as the result of the stranger slamming me at the wall, was quickly stopped. And my headaches vanished.\\n\\n \"We had a huge debate as to whether a spinal tap should be done, and I finally persuaded them to do it and get it over with. I survived the risk. They found no malignant cells in the fluid.\\n\\n \"In between my long journeys down the beautifully painted passageways of the hospital labyrinth I told the full story of the violent night to everyone who wanted to hear it.\\n\\n \"Dr. Winn Mayfair listened quietly and thoughtfully to my descriptions of Goblin and how Goblin had come to my defense, and Aunt Queen, who was in the room, did not interrupt, either to calm me when I became agitated or to add to what I had to say, though she was fast becoming an expert on the whole story.\\n\\n \"There was something deeply reserved about Dr. Winn. I didn\u0027t feel compelled to ask for his approval so much as his expertise, delicate though he was with all his remarks. And I wasn\u0027t surprised when he asked me to speak to a small select panel of psychiatrists.\\n\\n \"I said no. But Aunt Queen changed my mind. She had brought half her entire wardrobe to the hospital and was got up each day in one of her lovely sack-style dresses, with the appropriate cloche hat, and she sat at my bedside holding my hand warmly.\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t you see, I have to do this!\u0027 she pleaded. \u0027I have no choice. If I don\u0027t insist that you talk to these psychiatrists, we\u0027ll stand accused of simple negligence. Think it over, Quinn. We could both be accused. We have to get this out of the way and get back to life the way we want it to be.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027And how\u0027s that, Aunt Queen? What\u0027s to happen with Blackwood Manor? Don\u0027t you realize that if you and I leave on one of your exotic junkets, there\u0027ll be no Blackwood on the premises? I\u0027ll meet this teacher, yes, I told you I would, but not here. I insist that it not be here.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I understand, absolutely,\u0027 she said. \u0027And don\u0027t you worry about Nash, he\u0027s happily ensconced in the middle guest room at Blackwood Manor, and even if the plan goes south, as they say, he will have had something of a delicious Creole vacation.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You may find this hard to imagine, but I could swear Jasmine is flirting with Nash. Something\u0027s come over Jasmine. And it\u0027s high time if you ask me. Jasmine was prancing around today in a fancy Chanel suit I gave her two years ago. She used to never wear the truly fine things that I gave her. I think Jasmine sees her destiny.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Which is what?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027To run Blackwood Manor in our absence. She\u0027s completely capable, and Clem and Big Ramona will fully support her. I mean Jasmine has languished in domestic service all her life and she\u0027s sharp and well spoken and can certainly take on the responsibility for a portion of the profit.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I didn\u0027t know we made a profit,\u0027 I said. \u0027Pops said we operated at a loss perpetually.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, Pops was pessimistic, bless his soul, and of course he was right. The guests pay for some of the maintenance and upkeep and that\u0027s the whole point, to keep Blackwood Manor in existence, isn\u0027t it? Maybe I should say earnings instead of profit. How does that sound to you? When Pops\u0027 will is read, everything will be easier.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027When is that to happen?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027Well, Patsy\u0027s home, she has been for two days. I imagine we could do it day after tomorrow.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027All right,\u0027 I said. I was dazed by all this sudden information. I\u0027d been so self-involved, so full of fear and strange dreams of Rebecca and glances from a Technicolor Goblin.\\n\\n \"This idea of Jasmine running Blackwood Manor began to excite me. It was perfect for Jasmine. Aunt Queen understood Jasmine as no one else did, not even Jasmine.\\n\\n \"Suddenly, and with surprising verve, I wanted to escape this place. If Jasmine was going to resist her \u0027destiny,\u0027 I wanted a chance to talk to her. The simple fact was that Jasmine did run Blackwood Manor to a large extent, and though I wasn\u0027t so all-fired sure of her brother Clem supporting her, he might become a second-string supervisor for the men -- a job that Pops\u0027 helper, Allen, had done directly. I wanted desperately to get back.\\n\\n \"Besides, I wanted to see Jasmine all got up in a Chanel suit.\\n\\n \"(In my fiendish eighteen-year-old heart, I wanted a second shot at Jasmine.)\\n\\n \" \u0027All right, I\u0027ll see the panel of doctors,\u0027 I said. \u0027But I want my own clothes. I don\u0027t intend to run off. I just want my Armani duds, one of those handmade shirts you keep sending me from Europe, and my lucky Versace tie. Oh yeah, and my Johnston \u0026 Murphy shoes. I want to look sane if nothing else. And also Goblin likes those clothes. Whenever I dress up for an event at home, he\u0027s delirious.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027That\u0027s very reassuring,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll see to it at once. And really you should wear your Church\u0027s shoes. And can we expect Goblin to be with you at this meeting?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Of course,\u0027 I said. \u0027You think I\u0027d cut him out? Besides, I can\u0027t always control what Goblin does. He\u0027s been quiet here in this place. He\u0027s put up with a great quantity of contemptuous dismissal.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I suppose so,\u0027 she said, and I saw that she was staring right at the spot where Goblin stood staring at her in the same cold remote fashion.\\n\\n \"What I couldn\u0027t tell her was that Goblin had been acting strangely throughout the hospital stay. Also his appearance was no longer a duplicate of mine, though it might be when I was outfitted for the psychiatric panel.\\n\\n \"On the contrary, he didn\u0027t wear the hospital gowns or flannel nightshirts that I wore. He wore the jeans and shirts that were back home -- an amazing development.\\n\\n \"But it was the ever-shifting expressions on his face which most frightened me. I was definitely seeing his entire visage in greater detail. And there was a frigid quality to him and a despairing look at times, and it was rarely if ever a mirror of my feelings.\\n\\n \"After all, I hadn\u0027t felt the usual spells of panic in the hospital. I felt a cowardly sense of safety. There was too much going on, what with Aunt Queen ordering high tea to be served in my room and Big Ramona dropping in with fancy nightshirts for me and Sweetheart\u0027s beloved sister, Aunt Ruthie, coming by with gourmet chocolates, and guards poking their heads through the door and various cousins coming to pay their respects, though what they thought had happened to me, I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n \"Anyway, after innumerable delays I had the coveted laptop; I was seated in an easy chair beside the hospital bed and I wanted to draw Goblin out. My mind was a tangle of thoughts about Goblin.\\n\\n \" \u0027I need to work now, Aunt Queen,\u0027 I said very gently. \u0027Kiss me and go off to Commander\u0027s Palace for dinner. You haven\u0027t been there since this started.¡¯\\n\\n \"She was suspicious. \u0027But you\u0027ve no phone hookup here; what are you planning to do with the laptop? Write a novel?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m talking to Goblin through it. It\u0027s easier for him than telepathy. He feeds off the electricity. He asked for this.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, my darling Quinn,\u0027 she said with a flamboyant gesture of confusion and anxiety.\\n\\n \" \u0027Aunt Queen, let me tell you again, he saved my life. That bastard would have killed me!¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Darling, what would happen if you simply stopped speaking to Goblin altogether? And as for the island, what if we destroy the Hermitage, dismantle the strange mausoleum and move all of its gold panels back to the house and let the wisteria have the place?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You\u0027re shocking me,\u0027 I said. \u0027You\u0027re hurting me! I want the Hermitage. I\u0027ve been inspired by that marble desk and golden chair. I want to paint the place, floor it in marble. Look, I know the grief I\u0027m causing you. I know the pain you\u0027ve been through with Pops\u0027 death, and I don\u0027t mean for this agony to go on, but I want that place, don\u0027t you see, and it belongs to us, not this interloper!¡¯\\n\\n \"I glanced at Goblin. He was watching Aunt Queen in the most intense manner. And then he looked at me almost listlessly. It was as if he had acquired a taste for boredom. I had to talk to him. I had to make some judgment of what he now knew! I was the only person in the world who understood this problem.\\n\\n \" \u0027All right, precious dear,\u0027 said my beloved aunt. \u0027I\u0027m going upstairs for supper.¡¯\\n\\n \"She had previously made known to me, more than once, that there were four restaurants in this complex and the finest could rival any restaurant in New Orleans. This was all Rowan Mayfair\u0027s idea, to provide varying fare for relatives of the sick and the sick themselves. You could grab a quick meal in the generic cafeteria in the basement or mount to the rooftop Grand Lumini¨¨re for the most succulent choices.\\n\\n \"Aunt Queen had become a regular at the Grand Lumini¨¨re, and my meals came directly from their kitchen.\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027m meeting Nash, you know,\u0027 she went on to say, \u0027and if you\u0027d only just --¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027ll meet him when I\u0027m properly dressed,\u0027 I said. \u0027Not when I\u0027m got up like Wee Willie Winkie.¡¯\\n\\n \"She rose to go.\\n\\n \" \u0027And there\u0027s another thing,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \" \u0027Yes?\u0027 she asked. She was so polite, standing over me, ready to plant her tender kiss, so solicitous.\\n\\n \" \u0027When do I get out of here?¡¯\\n\\n \"Obviously this was a moment for a decision.\\n\\n \" \u0027Tomorrow, perhaps, after you talk to the panel of psychiatrists?\u0027 she proposed. \u0027It\u0027s scheduled for four p.m.¡¯\\n\\n \"Already arranged, I thought, but I made no remark on it.\\n\\n \" \u0027All right,\u0027 I said. \u0027Then suppose you and I and Nash and Goblin have supper in the Grand Lumini¨¨re after the appointment with the panel is over.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027That sounds marvelous,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027ve made me very happy. Oh, so extremely happy. And you should see the restaurant. And you will! And I can\u0027t wait to tell Nash.\u0027 And after another wealth of kisses she was off with the fragrance of Lynelle\u0027s marvelous perfume lingering behind her.\\n\\n \"I looked at Goblin. He showed no inclination to move from his lazy position in the corner. He was wearing my lucky Versace tie. It was positively flaunting.\\n\\n \"I flicked on the computer. \u0027You haven\u0027t talked to me since that first night.\u0027 I said it as I typed it. \u0027What\u0027s up with you? What\u0027s the matter? I\u0027ve told everyone what you did. I\u0027ve given you credit.¡¯\\n\\n \"He was gone, and the fact that he had been so vivid made it all the more startling. The computer keys started to move; he wrote:\\n\\n \" \u0027I like being angry.¡¯\\n\\n \"I was stunned.\\n\\n \" \u0027That\u0027s wrong,\u0027 I typed as I spoke. \u0027The man who hurt me was angry. Did you see the bad things he did to me?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Use bigger words,\u0027 said the computer in a rapid fire of keys. \u0027I told you I know all the words you ever used on the computer. I listen. I know. I know words and things. And when I was angry it was for you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I know it was for me,\u0027 I replied, speaking and tapping it out. \u0027Surely you\u0027ve heard me tell everyone.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t you see what is happening to you here?\u0027 he asked. The keys were moving at terrific speed. \u0027They are trying to take me from you. They are trying to divide us and we are Quinn Goblin and they don\u0027t understand about us.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what they think,\u0027 I said. I spoke softly. \u0027I love you. I am loyal to you. They can\u0027t part us. It\u0027s impossible. But you can\u0027t be angry. You can\u0027t be violent. If you\u0027re angry and violent I can\u0027t love you.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Unless it\u0027s for you, you mean,\u0027 he countered. \u0027If it\u0027s for you, then it\u0027s good, isn\u0027t it?¡¯\\n\\n \"He had never phrased anything in this way. It was a tiny yet momentous twist of sophistication.\\n\\n \" \u0027That\u0027s true,\u0027 I said. \u0027I do want you to protect me. Protect Blackwood Manor. Protect all those I love.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You make me laugh,\u0027 he wrote.\\n\\n \" \u0027Why\u0027s that?\u0027 I asked with belligerent innocence.\\n\\n \"The computer was pushed out of my lap to the floor. Before I could rise from the chair he was beside me, fully realized, and he kissed me on the lips. Then he drew back until he was no more than a foot from me, and his arms slipped around me and they gripped me.\\n\\n \"He moved his lips, and for the first time I heard a true voice come out of him, slow, masculine in tone and without inflection.\\n\\n \" \u0027You\u0027re afraid of me now,\u0027 he said, his lips moving sluggishly.\\n\\n \" \u0027Is that what you want?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \"I was terrified. Never once in my brawl with the stranger had I felt this kind of fear.\\n\\n \" \u0027You want me to be afraid?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I can\u0027t love you and be afraid of you. I\u0027ll come to hate you if I\u0027m afraid. Did you see how I hated the stranger? Make a choice.¡¯\\n\\n \"Again, he came in for the kiss, and I felt his lips on mine, just as firmly as I had felt Jasmine\u0027s kisses. His hand went down between my legs. He ran his hand under my nightshirt.\\n\\n \" \u0027No, not here,\u0027 I said. \u0027Be patient.¡¯\\n\\n \"Again he spoke to me. He spoke.\\n\\n \" \u0027But when you feel it, I feel it. I want it.¡¯\\n\\n \"I felt his hand on my cock, and I gave in. I gave in quickly, and it was over within seconds.\\n\\n \"I sat back in the easy chair and closed my eyes. My body was lulled and humming. There was a time of silence. Perhaps five or more minutes. But he was still there. He was kneeling right beside me, but I couldn\u0027t look at him.\\n\\n \" \u0027Who was the stranger?\u0027 I asked. I opened my eyes. \u0027I\u0027ve asked you over and over. Who was he?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he responded. The sound of the monotone voice was literally dreadful.\\n\\n \" \u0027Where is the stranger?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he responded again. \u0027If I knew, I would find him and hurt him. I don\u0027t know everything.\u0027 On it went, flat and low. \u0027I know lots more than you think I do.¡¯\\n\\n \"I said nothing. I was too afraid. I tried to feel love, not because I wanted to love him but because I was going mad. By tomorrow I might be roaring mad.\\n\\n \" \u0027I want you to leave me now,\u0027 I said. I looked into his eyes. \u0027I want you to leave me to think, you understand me?¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027You think you can command me,\u0027 came that monotone voice. The lips were slightly disconnected from it. \u0027You can\u0027t command me,\u0027 he said. \u0027But for love, I\u0027ll leave you alone. Beware of what they do to you here.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027Don\u0027t frighten me anymore,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t want to frighten you,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027But you must understand they want to change you. They want to make you so you can\u0027t see or hear me.¡¯\\n\\n \" \u0027That can\u0027t be done,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Go now. I must be alone. Don\u0027t you ever want to be alone?¡¯\\n\\n \"No answer.\\n\\n \" \u0027Where do you go when you\u0027re not with me?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \"No answer.\\n\\n \" \u0027Tell me,\u0027 I said. \u0027Where do you go when you leave? Or do you stay with me, invisible, just watching and learning?¡¯\\n\\n \"No answer.\\n\\n \"I felt him leave. I felt a change of temperature in the room. I heard things stirring, the paper tissue ruffled in its box, the creak of the bed, the faint rattle of the Venetian blinds, then nothing.\\n\\n \"I made the Sign of the Cross. What was I going to do? Where was I going to go to find someone who would understand this? Hell, I needed someone to tell me what to do.\\n\\n \"I went into the bathroom and washed the slimy semen off my legs. I washed my hands. Then I came back, and I took my rosary out of the nightstand. Big Ramona had found it for me. It was a garnet rosary from my First Communion. Lynelle\u0027s gift. I started to say it.\\n\\n \"But I couldn\u0027t meditate on the mysteries. I thought of the stranger. What if he came back to Blackwood Manor? If the Hermitage was destroyed, what would he do? I pictured him, those fiery dark eyes. How perfectly furious he had been, pivoting wild as a dervish as the broken glass assaulted him.\\n\\n \"And if I went to sleep, I\u0027d dream of Rebecca.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-20.html","bookId":2595,"book":{"id":2595,"title":"Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9)","description":"Storyline: Blackwood Farm (The Vampire Chronicles #9) \\n Lestat is back, saviour and demon, presiding over a gothic story of family greed and hatred through generations, a terrifying drama of blood lust and betrayal, possession and matricide.
