I stretched out on the table and closed my eyes, preparing to take a catnap to get through the long night ahead.\n I loved dressing up and looking pretty as much as the next girl, but charity functions were a lot of work. Making small talk was exhausting, smiling nonstop was a pain, and conversations about businesses and people I didn\u0027t know were boring. If it wasn\u0027t for Cary benefitting from the exposure, I\u0027d put up a bigger fight about going.\n I sighed. Who was I fooling? I\u0027d end up going anyway. My mom and Stanton supported abused children\u0027s charities because they were significant to me. Going to the occasional stuffy event was a small price to pay for the return.\n Taking a deep breath, I consciously relaxed. I made a mental note to call my dad when I got home and thought about how to send a thank-you note to Gideon for the hangover cure. I supposed I could e-mail him using the contact info on his business card, but that lacked class. Besides, I didn\u0027t know who read his inbox.\n I\u0027d just call him when I got home. Why not? He\u0027d asked - no, told - me to; he\u0027d written the demand on his business card. And I\u0027d get to hear his luscious voice again.\n The door opened and the masseuse came in. \"Hello, Eva. You ready?\"\n Not quite. But I was getting there.\n After many lovely hours at the spa, my mom and Cary dropped me off at the apartment; then they headed out to hunt for new cuff links for Stanton. I used the time alone to call Gideon. Even with the much-needed privacy, I punched most of his phone number into the keypad a half-dozen times before I finally put the call through.\n He answered on the first ring. \"Eva.\"\n Startled that he\u0027d known who was calling, my mind scrambled for a moment. How did he have my name and number in his contact list? \"Uh...hi, Gideon.\"\n \"I\u0027m a block away. Let the front desk know I\u0027m coming.\"\n \"What?\" I felt like I\u0027d missed part of the conversation. \"Coming where?\"\n \"To your place. I\u0027m rounding the corner now. Call the desk, Eva.\"\n He hung up and I stared at the phone, trying to absorb the fact that Gideon was moments away from being with me again. Somewhat dazed, I went to the intercom and talked to the front desk, letting them know I was expecting him and while I was talking, he walked into the lobby. A few moments after that, he was at my door.\n It was then that I remembered I was dressed in only a thigh-length silk robe, and my face and hair were styled for the dinner. What kind of impression would he get from my appearance?\n I tightened the belt of my robe before I let him in. It wasn\u0027t like I\u0027d invited him over for a seduction or anything.\n Gideon stood in the hallway for a long moment, his gaze raking me from my head down to my French manicured toes. I was equally stunned by his appearance. The way he looked in worn jeans and a T-shirt made me want to undress him with my teeth.\n \"Worth the trip to find you like this, Eva.\" He stepped inside and locked the door behind him. \"How are you feeling?\"\n \"Good. Thanks to you. Thank you.\" My stomach quivered because he was here, with me, which made me feel almost...giddy. \"That can\u0027t be why you came over.\"\n \"I\u0027m here because it took you too long to call me.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize I had a deadline.\"\n \"I have to ask you something time-sensitive, but more than that, I wanted to know if you were feeling all right after last night.\" His eyes were dark as they swept over me, his breathtaking face framed by that luxurious curtain of inky hair. \"God. You look beautiful, Eva. I can\u0027t remember ever wanting anything this much.\"\n With just those few simple words I became hot and needy. Way too vulnerable. \"What\u0027s so urgent?\"\n \"Go with me to the advocacy center dinner tonight.\"\n I pulled back, surprised and excited by the request. \"You\u0027re going?\"\n \"So are you. I checked, knowing your mother would be there. Let\u0027s go together.\"\n My hand went to my throat, my mind torn between the weirdness of how much he knew about me and concern over what he was asking me to do. \"That\u0027s not what I meant when I said we should spend time together.\"\n \"Why not?\" The simple question was laced with challenge. \"What\u0027s the problem with going together to an event we\u0027d already planned on attending separately?\"\n \"It\u0027s not very discreet. It\u0027s a high-profile event.\"\n \"So?\" Gideon stepped closer and fingered a curl of my hair.\n There was a dangerous purr to his voice that sent a shiver through me. I could feel the warmth of his big, hard body and smell the richly masculine scent of his skin. I was falling under his spell, deeper with every minute that passed.\n \"People will make assumptions, my mother in particular. She\u0027s already scenting your bachelor blood in the water.\"\n Lowering his head, Gideon pressed his lips into the crook of my neck. \"I don\u0027t care what people think. We know what we\u0027re doing. And I\u0027ll deal with your mother.\"\n \"If you think you can,\" I said breathlessly, \"you don\u0027t know her very well.\"\n \"I\u0027ll pick you up at seven.\" His tongue traced the wildly throbbing vein in my throat and I melted into him, my body going lax as he pulled me close.\n Still, I managed to say, \"I haven\u0027t said yes.\"\n \"But you won\u0027t say no.\" He caught my earlobe between his teeth. \"I won\u0027t let you.\"\n I opened my mouth to protest and he sealed his lips over mine, shutting me up with a lush wet kiss. His tongue did that slow, savoring licking that made me long to feel him doing the same between my legs. My hands went to his hair, sliding through it, tugging. When he wrapped his arms around me, I arched, curving into his hands. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-22.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
