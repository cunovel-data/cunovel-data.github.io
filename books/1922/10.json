Cary could always do that. \"I doubt that man has ever had blue balls in his life, but it\u0027s a fun fantasy.\" He shut his netbook with a decisive snap. \"What should we do tonight?\" \"I was thinking I\u0027d like to go check out that Krav Maga studio in Brooklyn.\" I\u0027d done a little research after meeting Parker Smith during my workout at Equinox and as the week passed, the thought of having that kind of raw, physical outlet for stress seemed more and more ideal. I knew it wouldn\u0027t be anything close to banging the hell out of Gideon Cross, but I suspected it would be a lot less dangerous to my health. Chapter 3 \"There\u0027s no way your mom and Stanton are going to let you come out here at night multiple times a week,\" Cary said, hugging his stylish denim jacket around him even though it wasn\u0027t more than slightly chilly. The converted warehouse Parker Smith used as his studio was a brick-faced building in a formerly industrial area of Brooklyn presently struggling to revitalize. The space was vast, and the massive metal delivery-bay doors offered no exterior clue as to what was taking place inside. Cary and I sat in aluminum bleachers, watching a half-dozen combatants on the mats below. \"Ouch.\" I winced in sympathy as a guy took a kick to the groin. Even with padding, that had to sting. \"How\u0027s Stanton going to find out, Cary?\" \"Because you\u0027ll be in the hospital?\" He glanced at me. \"Seriously. Krav Maga is brutal. They\u0027re just sparring and it\u0027s full contact. And even if the bruises don\u0027t give you away, your stepdad will find out somehow. He always does.\" \"Because of my mom; she tells him everything. But I\u0027m not telling her about this.\" \"Why not?\" \"She won\u0027t understand. She\u0027ll think I want to protect myself because of what happened, and she\u0027ll feel guilty and give me grief about it. She won\u0027t believe my main interest is exercise and stress relief.\" I propped my chin on my palm and watched Parker take the floor with a woman. He was a good instructor. Patient and thorough, and he explained things in an easy to understand way. His studio was in a rough neighborhood, but I thought it suited what he was teaching. It didn\u0027t get more \"reality based\" than a big, empty warehouse. \"That Parker guy is really hot,\" Cary murmured. \"He\u0027s also wearing a wedding band.\" \"I noticed. The good ones always get snatched up quick.\" Parker joined us after the class was over, his dark eyes bright and his smile brighter. \"What\u0027d ya think, Eva?\" \"Where do I sign up?\" His sexy smile made Cary reach over and squeeze the blood out of my hand. \"Step this way.\" Friday started out awesome. Mark walked me through the process of collecting information for an RFP, and he told me a little more about Cross Industries and Gideon Cross, pointing out that he and Cross were the same age. \"I have to remind myself of that,\" Mark said. \"It\u0027s easy to forget he\u0027s so young when he\u0027s right in front of you.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed, secretly disappointed that I wouldn\u0027t see Cross for the next two days. As much as I told myself it didn\u0027t matter, I was bummed. I hadn\u0027t realized I\u0027d been excited by the possibility that we might run into each other until that possibility was gone. It was just such a rush being near him. Plus he was a hell of a lot of fun to look at. I had nothing nearly as exciting planned for the weekend. I was taking notes in Mark\u0027s office when I heard my desk phone ringing. Excusing myself, I rushed over to catch it. \"Mark Garrity\u0027s office - \" \"Eva love. How are you?\" I sank into my chair at the sound of my stepfather\u0027s voice. Stanton always sounded like old money to me - cultured, entitled, and arrogant. \"Richard. Is everything okay? Is Mom all right?\" \"Yes. Everything\u0027s fine. Your mother is wonderful, as always.\" His tone softened when he spoke of his wife and I was grateful for that. I was grateful to him for a lot of things actually, but it was sometimes hard to balance that against my feelings of disloyalty. I knew my dad was self-conscious about the massive differences in their income brackets. \"Good,\" I said, relieved. \"I\u0027m glad. Did you and Mom receive my thank-you note for the dress and Cary\u0027s tuxedo?\" \"Yes, and it was thoughtful of you, but you know we don\u0027t expect you to thank us for such things. Excuse me a moment.\" He spoke to someone, most likely his secretary. \"Eva love, I\u0027d like us to get together for lunch today. I\u0027ll send Clancy around to collect you.\" \"Today? But we\u0027ll be seeing each other tomorrow night. Can\u0027t it wait until then?\" \"No, it should be today.\" \"But I only get an hour for lunch.\" A tap on my shoulder turned me around to find Mark standing by my cubicle. \"Take two,\" he whispered. \"You earned it.\" I sighed and mouthed a thank you. \"Will twelve o\u0027clock work, Richard?\" \"Perfectly. I look forward to seeing you.\" I had no reason to look forward to private meetings with Stanton, but I dutifully left just before noon and found a town car waiting for me, idling at the curb. Clancy, Stanton\u0027s driver and body guard, opened the door for me as I greeted him. Then he slid behind the wheel and drove me downtown. By twenty after the hour, I was sitting at a conference table in Stanton\u0027s offices, eyeing a beautifully catered lunch for two. Stanton came in shortly after my arrival, looking dapper and distinguished. His hair was pure white, his face lined but still very handsome. His eyes were the color of worn blue denim, and they were sharp with intelligence. He was trim and athletic, taking the time out of his busy days to stay fit even before he\u0027d married his trophy wife - my mom.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-10.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
