For example, if not hearing from Eva for a few days troubles you, perhaps a text message or an e-mail will alleviate that.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"If you like, we can go over the list together.\"\n The back-and-forth between the two made me want to scream. It was insult to injury. I hadn\u0027t expected Dr. Petersen to smack some sense into my mom, but I\u0027d hoped he would at least take a harder line - God knew someone needed to, someone whose authority she respected.\n When the hour ended and we were on our way out, I asked my mom to wait a moment so I could ask Dr. Petersen one last personal and private question.\n \"Yes, Eva?\" He stood in front of me, looking infinitely patient and wise.\n \"I just wondered...\" I paused, needing to swallow past a lump in my throat. \"Is it possible for two abuse survivors to have a functional romantic relationship?\"\n \"Absolutely.\" His immediate, unequivocal answer forced the trapped air from my lungs.\n I shook his hand. \"Thank you.\"\n When I got home, I unlocked my door with the keys Gideon had returned to me and I went straight to my room, offering a lame wave to Cary, who was practicing yoga in the living room to a DVD.\n I stripped off my clothes as I crossed the distance from my closed bedroom door to the bed, finally crawling between the cool sheets in just my underwear. I hugged a pillow and closed my eyes, so tired and drained I had nothing left.\n The door opened at my back and a moment later Cary sat beside me.\n He brushed my hair back from my tear-streaked face. \"What\u0027s the matter, baby girl?\"\n \"I got kicked to the curb today. Courtesy of a f**king note card.\"\n He sighed. \"You know the drill, Eva. He\u0027s going to keep pushing you away, because he\u0027s expecting you to fail him like everyone else has.\"\n \"And I keep proving him right.\" I recognized myself in the description Cary had just given. I ran when the going got tough, because I was so sure it was all going to end badly. The only control I had was to be the one who left, instead of the one who was left behind.\n \"Because you\u0027re fighting to protect your own recovery.\" He lay down and spooned against my back, wrapping one leanly muscular arm around me and tucking me tight against him.\n I snuggled into the physical affection I hadn\u0027t realized I needed. \"He might\u0027ve dumped me because of my past, not his.\"\n \"If that\u0027s true, it\u0027s good it\u0027s over. But I think you two will find each other eventually. At least I\u0027m hoping you will.\" His sigh was soft on my neck. \"I want there to be happily-ever-afters for the f**ked-up crowd. Show me the way, Eva honey. Make me believe.\"\n Chapter 15\n Friday found Trey sharing breakfast with Cary and me after an overnighter. As I drank the day\u0027s first cup of coffee, I watched him interact with Cary and I was genuinely thrilled to see the intimate smiles and covert touches they gave one another.\n I\u0027d had easy relationships like that and hadn\u0027t appreciated them at the time. They had been comfortable and uncomplicated, but they\u0027d been superficial in a fundamental way, too.\n How deep could a love affair get if you didn\u0027t know the darkest recesses of your lover\u0027s soul? That was the dilemma I\u0027d faced with Gideon.\n Day 2 After Gideon had begun. I found myself wanting to go to him and apologize for leaving him yet again. I wanted to tell him I was there for him, ready to listen or simply offer silent comfort. But I was too emotionally invested. I got wounded too easily. I was too afraid of rejection. And knowing he wouldn\u0027t let me get too close only intensified that fear. Even if we did figure things out, I\u0027d only tear myself apart trying to live with just the bits and pieces he decided to share with me.\n At least my job was going well. The celebratory lunch the executives gave in honor of the agency landing the Kingsman account made me genuinely happy. I felt blessed to work in such a positive environment. But when I heard that Gideon had been invited - although no one expected him to show up - I returned quietly to my desk and focused on work the rest of the afternoon.\n I hit the gym on the way home; then picked up some items to make fettuccini alfredo for dinner with creme brulee for dessert - comfort food guaranteed to put me in a carbohydrate coma. I expected sleep to offer me a break from the endless what-ifs my brain was recycling, hopefully long into Saturday morning.\n Cary and I ate in the living room with chopsticks, his idea to cheer me up. He said dinner was great, but I couldn\u0027t tell. I snapped out of it when he fell silent, too, and I realized I was being a less than stellar friend.\n \"When are the Grey Isles\u0027 campaign ads going up?\" I asked.\n \"I\u0027m not sure, but get this...\" He grinned. \"You know how it is with male models - we\u0027re tossed around like condoms at an orgy. It\u0027s tough to stand out from the crowd, unless you\u0027re dating someone famous. Which I\u0027m suddenly reported to be doing since those photos of you and me were plastered everywhere. I\u0027m the side piece of action in your relationship with Gideon Cross. You\u0027ve done wonders for making me a hot commodity.\"\n I laughed. \"You didn\u0027t need my help for that.\"\n \"Well, it certainly didn\u0027t hurt. Anyway, they called me back for a couple more shoots. I think they might just use me for more than five minutes.\"\n \"We\u0027ll have to celebrate,\" I teased.\n \"Absolutely. When you\u0027re up for it.\"\n We ended up hanging out and watching the original Tron. His smartphone rang twenty minutes into the movie and I heard him speaking to his agency. \"Sure. I\u0027ll be there in fifteen, tops. I\u0027ll call you when I get there.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-62.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
