His hand was in my hair, fisting it roughly, holding me in place so I couldn\u0027t turn away. I bit the tongue he thrust aggressively into my mouth, then his lower lip, tasting blood, but he didn\u0027t stop. I shoved at his shoulders with everything I had, but I couldn\u0027t budge him. Goddamn Stanton! If not for him and my crazy-assed mother, I\u0027d have had a few Krav Maga classes under my belt by now... Gideon kissed me as if he was starved for the taste of me and my resistance began to melt. He smelled so good, so familiar. His body felt so perfectly right against mine. My ni**les betrayed me, hardening into tight points, and a slow, hot trickle of arousal gathered in my core. My heart thundered in my chest. God, I wanted him. The craving hadn\u0027t gone away, not even for a minute. He picked me up. Imprisoned by his tight grip, it was hard to breathe and my head began to spin. When he carried me through a door and kicked it shut behind him, I couldn\u0027t do more than make a feeble sound of protest. I found myself pressed against a heavy glass door on the other side of a library, Gideon\u0027s hard and powerful body subduing my own. His arm at my waist slid lower, his hand delving beneath my skirts and finding the curves of my butt exposed by my lacy boy shorts underwear. He wrenched my h*ps hard to his, making me feel how hard he was, how aroused. My sex trembled with want, achingly empty. All the fight left me. My arms fell to my sides, my palms pressing flat to the glass. I felt the brittle tension drain from his body as I softened in surrender, the pressure of his mouth easing and his kiss turning into a passionate coaxing. \"Eva,\" he breathed gruffly. \"Don\u0027t fight me. I can\u0027t take it.\" My eyes closed. \"Let me go, Gideon.\" He nuzzled his cheek against mine, his breath gusting hard and fast over my ear. \"I can\u0027t. I know you\u0027re disgusted by what you saw the other night...what I was doing to myself - \" \"Gideon, no!\" God. Did he think I left him because of that? \"That\u0027s not why - \" \"I\u0027m losing my mind without you.\" His lips were gliding down my neck, his tongue stroking over my racing pulse. He sucked on my skin and pleasure radiated through me. \"I can\u0027t think. I can\u0027t work or sleep. My body aches for you. I can make you want me again. Let me try.\" Tears slipped free and ran down my face. They splashed on the upper swell of my br**sts and he licked at them, lapping them away. How would I ever recover if he made love to me again? How would I survive if he didn\u0027t? \"I never stopped wanting you,\" I whispered. \"I can\u0027t stop. But you hurt me, Gideon. You have the power to hurt me like no one else can.\" His gaze was stark and confused on my face. \"I hurt you? How?\" \"You lied to me. You shut me out.\" I cupped his face, needing him to understand this one thing without question. \"Your past doesn\u0027t have the power to push me away. Only you can do that, and you did.\" \"I didn\u0027t know what to do,\" he rasped. \"I never wanted you to see me like that...\" \"That\u0027s the problem, Gideon. I want to know who you are, the good and the bad, and you want to keep parts of yourself hidden from me. If you don\u0027t open up, we\u0027re going to lose each other down the road and I won\u0027t be able to take it. I\u0027m barely surviving it now. I\u0027ve crawled through the last four days of my life. Another week, a month...It\u0027ll break me to give you up.\" \"I can let you in, Eva. I\u0027m trying. But your first response when I screw up is to run away. You do it every time and I can\u0027t stand feeling like any moment I\u0027m going to do or say something wrong and you\u0027re going to bolt.\" His mouth was tender again as he brushed his lips back and forth over mine. I didn\u0027t argue with him. How could I, when he was right? \"I hoped you\u0027d come back on your own,\" he murmured, \"but I can\u0027t stay away anymore. I\u0027ll carry you out of here if I have to. Whatever it takes to get you back in the same room with me, talking this out.\" My heart stuttered. \"You were hoping I\u0027d come back? I thought...You gave me back my keys. I thought we were over.\" He pulled back, his face set in fierce lines. \"We\u0027ll never be over, Eva.\" I looked at him, my heart aching like an open wound at how beautiful he was, how broken and in pain he was - pain I\u0027d caused to some degree. On tiptoes, I kissed the reddened handprint I\u0027d left on his cheek, clutching his thick silky hair in my hands. Gideon bent his knees to align our bodies, his breathing harsh and erratic. \"I\u0027ll do whatever you want, whatever you need. Anything. Just take me back.\" Maybe I should have been scared by the depth of his need, but I felt the same passionate insanity for him. Running my hands down his chest in an effort to soothe his trembling, I gave him the hard truth. \"We can\u0027t seem to stop making each other miserable. I can\u0027t keep doing this to you and I can\u0027t keep going through these crazy highs and lows. We need help, Gideon. We\u0027re seriously dysfunctional.\" \"I saw Dr. Petersen on Friday. He\u0027s going to take me on as a patient, and - if you agree - he\u0027ll take us both on as a couple. I figured if you can trust him, I can try.\" \"Dr. Petersen?\" I remembered the brief jolt I\u0027d felt at seeing a black Bentley SUV when Clancy pulled away from the doctor\u0027s office. At the time, I\u0027d told myself it was wishful thinking. After all, there were countless black SUVs in New York. \"You had me followed.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-66.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
