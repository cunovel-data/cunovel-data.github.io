Then his arms crossed like mine. \"Christ, Eva.\"\n I watched him squirm and felt a flare of hope. \"If that\u0027s all you\u0027ve got, we\u0027re done.\"\n \"The hell we are.\"\n \"We\u0027ve already hit a dead end if you\u0027re going to take a head trip every time we have sex.\"\n He visibly struggled with what to say. \"I\u0027m used to having control. I need it. And you blew it all to hell in the limousine. I didn\u0027t handle that well.\"\n \"Ya think?\"\n \"Eva.\" He approached. \"I\u0027ve never experienced anything like that. I didn\u0027t think it was possible for me to. Now that I have...I\u0027ve got to have it. I\u0027ve got to have you.\"\n \"It\u0027s just sex, Gideon. Super awesome sex, but that can seriously screw with your head when the two people doing it aren\u0027t good for each other.\"\n \"Bullshit. I\u0027ve admitted I f**ked up. I can\u0027t change what happened, but I can sure as shit get pissed that you want to cut me off because of it. You laid out your rules and I adjusted to accommodate them, but you won\u0027t make even a tiny adjustment for me. You have to meet me halfway.\" His face was hard with frustration. \"At least give me a damn inch.\"\n I stared at him, trying to figure out what he was doing and where this was going. \"What do you want, Gideon?\" I asked softly.\n He caught me to him and cupped my cheek in one hand. \"I want to keep feeling the way I feel when I\u0027m with you. Just tell me what I have to do. And give me some room to screw up. I\u0027ve never done this before. There\u0027s a learning curve.\"\n I placed my palm over his heart and felt its pounding rhythm. He was anxious and passionate, and that had me on edge. How was I supposed to respond? Did I go with my gut or my common sense? \"Done what before?\"\n \"Whatever it takes to spend as much time with you as possible. In and out of bed.\"\n The rush of delight that swept through me was ridiculously powerful. \"Do you understand how much work and time a relationship between us is going to take, Gideon? I\u0027m wiped out already. Plus I\u0027m still working on some personal stuff, and I have my new job...my crazy mother...\"\n My fingers covered his mouth before he could open it. \"But you\u0027re worth it, and I want you bad enough. So I guess I don\u0027t have a choice, do I?\"\n \"Eva. Damn you.\" Gideon lifted me, hitching one arm beneath my rear to urge me to wrap my legs around his waist. He kissed me hard on the mouth and nuzzled his nose against mine. \"We\u0027ll figure it out.\"\n \"You say that as if it\u0027ll be easy.\" I knew I was high-maintenance and he was obviously going to be the same.\n \"Easy\u0027s boring.\" He carried me over to the bar and set me down on a barstool. He pulled the dome off my place setting and revealed a massive cheeseburger and fries. The meal was still warm, thanks to a heated granite slab beneath the plate.\n \"Yum,\" I murmured, becoming aware of how hungry I was. Now that we\u0027d talked, my appetite had returned full force.\n He snapped open my napkin and laid it over my lap with a squeeze to my knee; then he took the seat beside me. \"So, how do we do this?\"\n \"Well, you pick it up with your hands and put it in your mouth.\"\n He shot me a wry look that made me smile. It felt good to smile. It felt good to be with him. It usually did...for a little while. I took a bite of my burger, moaning when I got a full hit of its flavor. It was a traditional cheeseburger, but the taste was divine.\n \"Good, right?\" he asked.\n \"Very good. In fact, a guy who knows about burgers this good might be worth keeping to myself.\" I wiped my mouth and hands. \"How resistant are you to exclusivity?\"\n As he set his burger down, there was an eerie stillness to him. I couldn\u0027t begin to guess what he was thinking. \"I assumed that was implied in our arrangement. But to avoid any doubts, I\u0027ll be clear and say there won\u0027t be any other men for you, Eva.\"\n A shiver moved through me at the blunt finality in his tone and the iciness of his gaze. I knew he had a dark side; I\u0027d learned long ago how to spot and avoid men who had dangerous shadows in their eyes. But the familiar alarm bells didn\u0027t ring around Gideon as they maybe should have. \"But women are okay?\" I asked to lighten the mood.\n His brows rose. \"I know your roommate is bisexual. Are you?\"\n \"Would that bother you?\"\n \"Sharing you would bother me. It\u0027s not an option. Your body belongs to me, Eva.\"\n \"And yours belongs to me? Exclusively?\"\n His gaze turned hot. \"Yes, and I expect you to take frequent and excessive advantage of it.\"\n Well, then...\"But you\u0027ve seen me naked,\" I teased, my voice husky. \"You know what you\u0027re getting. I don\u0027t. I love what I\u0027ve seen of your body so far, but that hasn\u0027t been a whole lot.\"\n \"We can rectify that now.\"\n The thought of him stripping for me made me squirm in my seat. He noticed and his mouth curved wickedly.\n \"You\u0027d better not,\" I said regretfully. \"I was late getting back on Friday.\"\n \"Tonight, then.\"\n I swallowed hard. \"Absolutely.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be sure to clear my schedule by five.\" He resumed eating, completely at ease with the fact that we\u0027d both just penciled \"mind-blowing sex\" into our mental day calendars.\n \"You don\u0027t have to.\" I opened the mini ketchup bottle by my plate. \"I need to hit the gym after work.\"\n \"We\u0027ll go together.\"\n \"Really?\" I turned the bottle upside down and thumped the bottom with my palm.\n He took it from me and used his knife to coax the ketchup onto my plate. \"It\u0027s probably best for me to work off some energy before I get you naked. I\u0027m sure you\u0027d like to be able to walk tomorrow.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-34.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
