You planted the story.\" \"Not entirely true,\" he said smoothly. \"The photographer happened to be there. I just gave him a picture worth printing, and told PR to make it clear who you are and what you are to me.\" \"Why? Why would you do that?\" \"You have your way of dealing with jealousy and I have mine. We\u0027re both off the market and now everyone knows it. Why is that a problem for you?\" \"I was worried about your reaction, but there\u0027s more...There are things you don\u0027t know and I - \" I took a deep, shaky breath. \"It can\u0027t be that way between us, Gideon. We can\u0027t be public. I don\u0027t want - Damn it. I\u0027ll embarrass you.\" \"You couldn\u0027t. It\u0027s not possible.\" He brushed a loose lock of hair off my face. \"Can we talk about this later? If you need me - \" \"No, it\u0027s okay. Go.\" Cary came over. Dressed in baggy black cargo pants and a V-neck white undershirt, he still managed to look expensive. \"Everything all right?\" \"Hi, Cary. Everything\u0027s fine.\" Gideon squeezed my hand. \"Enjoy your lunch and don\u0027t worry.\" He could say that because he didn\u0027t know better. And I didn\u0027t know whether or not he\u0027d still want me once he did. Cary faced me as Gideon walked away. \"Worry about what? What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Everything.\" I sighed. \"Let\u0027s get out of here, and I\u0027ll tell you over lunch.\" \"Well,\" Cary murmured, looking at the link I\u0027d forwarded from my smartphone to his. \"That\u0027s some kiss. The dip was a great touch. He couldn\u0027t look more into if he tried.\" \"That\u0027s the thing.\" I took another big gulp of water. \"He did try.\" He shoved his phone into his pocket. \"Last week you kept shooting him down for only wanting your vagina. This week he\u0027s publicizing that he\u0027s in a committed, passionate relationship with you, and you\u0027re still unhappy. I\u0027m starting to feel bad for the guy. He can\u0027t win for trying.\" That stung. \"Reporters are going to dig, Cary, and they\u0027re going to find dirt. And since it\u0027s juicy dirt they\u0027re going to splash it all over hell and back, and it\u0027s going to embarrass Gideon.\" \"Baby girl.\" He set his hand over mine. \"Stanton buried all that.\" Stanton. I straightened. I hadn\u0027t thought of my stepfather. He\u0027d see the disaster coming and keep a lid on it because he knew what the revelation would do to my mother. Still...\"I\u0027ll have to talk to Gideon about it. He has a right to be warned.\" Just the thought of that conversation made me miserable. Cary knew how my brain worked. \"If you think he\u0027s going to cut and run, I think you\u0027re wrong. He looks at you like you\u0027re the only person in the room.\" I poked at my tuna Caesar salad. \"He\u0027s got a few demons of his own. Nightmares. He\u0027s closed himself off, I think, because of whatever\u0027s eating at him.\" \"But he\u0027s let you in.\" And he\u0027d already shown hints of how possessive he could be about that connection. I accepted that because it was a flaw I shared, but still... \"You\u0027re analyzing this to death, Eva,\" Cary said. \"You\u0027re thinking the way he feels about you has to be a fluke or a mistake. Someone like him couldn\u0027t really be into you for your big heart and sharp mind, right?\" \"My self-esteem isn\u0027t that bad,\" I protested. He took a sip of his champagne. \"Isn\u0027t it? So tell me something you think he likes about you that doesn\u0027t have to do with sex or codependency.\" I thought about it and came up empty, which made me scowl. \"Right,\" he went on with a nod. \"And if Cross is anywhere near as messed up as we are, he\u0027s thinking the same thing in reverse, wondering what a hot babe like you sees in a guy like him. You\u0027ve got money, so what has he got going for him besides being a stud who keeps screwing up?\" Sitting back in my chair, I absorbed everything he\u0027d said. \"Cary, I love you madly.\" He grinned. \"Back atcha, sweets. My advice, for what it\u0027s worth? Couples therapy. It\u0027s always been my plan to get into it when I find the one I want to settle down with. And try to have fun with him. You\u0027ve got to have as many good times as bad or it all becomes too painful and too much work.\" I reached over and squeezed his hand. \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" He shrugged off my gratitude with an elegant wave of his hand. \"It\u0027s easy to pick apart someone else\u0027s life. You know I couldn\u0027t get through my rough spots without you.\" \"Which you don\u0027t have any of now,\" I pointed out, shifting the focus to him. \"You\u0027re about to be splashed across a Times Square billboard. You won\u0027t be my secret any longer. Should we upgrade dinner from pizza to something more worthy of the occasion? How about we haul out that case of Cristal Stanton gave us?\" \"Now you\u0027re talking.\" \"Movies? Anything in particular you want to watch?\" \"Whatever you want. I wouldn\u0027t want to screw with your big-dumb-blow-\u0027em-up movie genius.\" I grinned, feeling better as I\u0027d known I would after an hour with Cary. \"You\u0027ll let me know if I\u0027m too dense to figure out when you and Trey want to be alone.\" \"Ha! Don\u0027t worry about that. Your tempestuous love life is making me feel dull and boring. I could use a hot, sweaty bang with my own stud.\" \"You just had a maintenance closet romp a couple days ago!\" He sighed. \"I\u0027d nearly forgotten. How sad is that?\" \"It isn\u0027t when your eyes are laughing.\" I\u0027d just gotten back to my desk when I checked my smartphone and found a text from Gideon letting me know he had fifteen minutes to spare at quarter to three. I nursed a secret rush of anticipation for the next hour and a half, having decided to take Cary\u0027s advice and have a little fun. Gideon and I would have to wade through the ugliness of my past soon enough, but for now, I could give us both something to smile about.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-46.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
