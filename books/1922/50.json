Mine, Eva. You\u0027re mine.\"\\n\\n I wrapped my legs around his hips, welcoming him deeper, feeling his bu**ocks flex and release against my calves as he demonstrated to my body that it would indeed take his thick length all the way to the root.\\n\\n With our hands linked, he took my mouth and began to move, gliding in and out with languid skill, the tempo precise and relentless yet smooth and easy. I felt every rock-hard inch of him, felt the unmistakable reiteration that every inch of me was his to possess. He drove the message home repeatedly until I was gasping against his mouth, thrashing restlessly beneath him, my hands bloodless from the strength of my grip on his.\\n\\n He spoke heated praise and encouragement, telling me how beautiful I was...how perfect I felt to him...how he\u0027d never stop...couldn\u0027t stop. I came with a sharp cry of relief, vibrating with the ecstasy of it, and he was right there with me. His pace quickened for several slamming thrusts; then he cl**axed with a hiss of my name, spilling into me.\\n\\n I sank lax into the mattress, sweaty and boneless and replete.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not done,\" he whispered darkly, adjusting his knees to increase the force of his thrusts. The pace remained expertly measured, each plunge staking a claim - your body exists to serve me.\\n\\n Biting my lip, I fought back the sounds of helpless pleasure that might\u0027ve broken the tranquility of the night...and betrayed the frightening depths of emotion I was beginning to feel for Gideon Cross.\\n\\n Chapter 12\\n\\n Gideon found me in the shower the next morning. He strode into the master bath gloriously nude, moving with that sleek confident grace I\u0027d admired from the beginning. His hair framed his face and shoulders in a sexy disheveled mane, a look that screamed a woman had clenched the rough black silk in greedy hands. Watching the flexing of his muscles as he moved, I didn\u0027t even pretend not to stare at the magnificent package between his legs.\\n\\n Despite the heat of the water, my ni**les beaded tight and goose bumps raced across my skin.\\n\\n His knowing smile as he joined me told me he knew exactly what kind of effect he had on me. I retaliated by running soapy hands all over his godlike body; then sitting on the bench and sucking him off with such enthusiasm he had to support himself with both palms pressed flat against the tile.\\n\\n His raw, raspy instructions echoed in my mind the entire time I dressed for work, which I did quickly - before he had a chance to finish his shower and f**k the hell out of me as he\u0027d threatened to just before spurting fiercely down my throat.\\n\\n He\u0027d had no nightmares during the night. Sex as a sedative seemed to be working, and I was extremely grateful for that.\\n\\n \"I hope you don\u0027t think you\u0027ve gotten away,\" he said when he prowled after me into the kitchen. Immaculately dressed in a black pinstriped suit, he accepted the cup of coffee I handed him and gave me a look that promised all sorts of wicked things. I saw him in his supremely civilized attire and thought of the insatiable male who\u0027d slipped into my bed during the night. My blood quickened. I was sore, my muscles thrumming with remembered pleasure, and I was still thinking about more.\\n\\n \"Keep looking at me like that,\" he warned, leaning casually into the counter and sipping his coffee. \"See what happens.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to lose my job over you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d give you another one.\"\\n\\n I snorted. \"As what? Your sex slave?\"\\n\\n \"What a provocative suggestion. Let\u0027s discuss.\"\\n\\n \"Fiend,\" I muttered, rinsing out my mug in the sink and putting it in the dishwasher. \"Ready? For work?\"\\n\\n He finished his coffee and I held out my hand for his mug, but he bypassed me and rinsed it out himself. Another mortal task that made him seem accessible, less of a fantasy I\u0027d never have a chance of holding on to.\\n\\n He faced me. \"I want to take you out to dinner tonight, and then take you home to my bed.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you to burn out on me, Gideon.\" He was a man used to being alone, a man who hadn\u0027t had a meaningful physical relationship in a long time, if ever. How long before his flight instincts kicked in? Besides, we really needed to stay out of the public eye as a couple...\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make excuses.\" His features hardened. \"You don\u0027t get to decide I can\u0027t do this.\"\\n\\n I kicked myself for offending him. He was trying and I needed to make sure he got credit for that, not discouragement. \"That\u0027s not what I meant. I just don\u0027t want to crowd you. Plus we still need to - \"\\n\\n \"Eva.\" He sighed, the hard tension leaving him with that frustrated exhalation. \"You have to trust me. I\u0027m trusting you. I\u0027ve had to or we wouldn\u0027t be here now.\"\\n\\n Okay. I nodded, swallowing hard. \"Dinner and your place it is, then. I honestly can\u0027t wait.\"\\n\\n Gideon\u0027s words about trust lingered in my mind all morning, which was a good thing when the Google alert digest hit my inbox.\\n\\n There was more than one photo this time around. Each article and blog post had several shots of me and Cary hugging good-bye outside the restaurant where we\u0027d had lunch the day before. The captions speculated on the nature of our relationship and some noted that we lived together. Others suggested I was reeling in \"billionaire playboy Cross\" while keeping my up-and-coming model boyfriend on the side.\\n\\n The reason for the publicity became apparent when I saw the picture of Gideon mingled with the ones of me and Cary. It had been taken last night, while I was watching movies with Cary and Trey - and while Gideon was supposedly at a business dinner. In the photo, Gideon and Magdalene Perez smiled intimately at each other, her hand on his forearm as they stood outside a restaurant. The captions ranged between kudos for Gideon\u0027s \"bevy of beautiful socialites\" to speculation that he was hiding a broken heart over my infidelity by dating other women. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-50.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
