{"id":63228,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Grudgingly, I thought of Gideon Cross, who preferred to strip all intimacy out of the most intimate act I could imagine. I\u0027d had one-night stands and friends with benefits, and no one knew better than I that sex and making love were two very different things, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever be able to view sex like a handshake. I thought it was sad that Cross did, even though he wasn\u0027t a man who inspired pity or sympathy. \"Hey, baby girl,\" Cary called out, pushing to his feet. \"I was hoping you\u0027d make it back before Trey had to leave.\" \"I have class in an hour,\" Trey explained, rounding the coffee table as I dropped my bag on the floor and put my purse on a barstool at the breakfast bar. \"But I\u0027m glad I got to meet you before I left.\" \"Me, too.\" I shook the hand he extended to me, taking him in with a quick glance. He was about my age, I guessed. Average height and nicely muscular. He had unruly blond hair, soft hazel eyes, and a nose that had clearly been broken at some point. \"Mind if I grab a glass of wine?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s been a long day.\" \"Go for it,\" Trey replied. \"I\u0027ll take one, too.\" Cary joined us by the breakfast bar. He was wearing loose-fitting black jeans and an off-the-shoulder black sweater. The look was casual and elegant, and did a phenomenal job of offsetting his dark brown hair and emerald eyes. I went to the wine fridge and pulled out a random bottle. Trey shoved his hands in the pockets of his jeans and rocked back on his heels, talking quietly with Cary as I uncorked and poured. The phone rang and I grabbed the handset off the wall. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, Eva? It\u0027s Parker Smith.\" \"Parker, hi.\" I leaned my hip into the counter. \"How are you?\" \"I hope you don\u0027t mind my calling. Your stepdad gave me your number.\" Gah. I\u0027d had enough of Stanton for one day. \"Not at all. What\u0027s up?\" \"Honestly? Everything\u0027s looking up right now. Your stepdad is like my fairy godfather. He\u0027s funding a few safety improvements to the studio and some much-needed upgrades. That\u0027s why I\u0027m calling. The studio\u0027s going to be out of commission for the rest of the week. Classes will resume next Monday.\" I closed my eyes, struggling to tamp down a flare of exasperation. It wasn\u0027t Parker\u0027s fault that Stanton and my mom were overprotective control freaks. Clearly they didn\u0027t see the irony of defending me while I was surrounded by people trained to do that very thing. \"Sounds good. I can\u0027t wait. I\u0027m really excited to be training with you.\" \"I\u0027m excited, too. I\u0027m going to work you hard, Eva. Your parents are going to get their money\u0027s worth.\" I set a filled glass in front of Cary and took a big gulp out of my own. It never ceased to amaze me how much cooperation money could buy. But again, that wasn\u0027t Parker\u0027s fault. \"No complaints here.\" \"We\u0027ll get started first thing next week. Your driver has the schedule.\" \"Great. See you then.\" I hung up and caught the glance Trey shot Cary when he thought neither of us was looking. It was soft and filled with a sweet yearning, and it reminded me that my problems could wait. \"I\u0027m sorry I caught you on the way out, Trey. Do you have time for pizza Wednesday night? I\u0027d love to do more than say hi and bye.\" \"I have class.\" He gave me a regretful smile and shot another side-glance at Cary. \"But I could come by on Tuesday.\" \"That\u0027d be great.\" I smiled. \"We could order in and have a movie night.\" \"I\u0027d like that.\" I was rewarded with the kiss Cary blew me as he headed to the door to show Trey out. When he returned to the kitchen he grabbed his wine and said, \"All right. Spill it, Eva. You looked stressed.\" \"I am,\" I agreed, grabbing the bottle and moving into the living room. \"It\u0027s Gideon Cross, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Oh, yeah. But I don\u0027t want to talk about him.\" Although Gideon\u0027s pursuit was exhilarating, his goal sucked. \"Let\u0027s talk about you and Trey instead. How did you two meet?\" \"I ran across him on a job. He\u0027s working part time as a photographer\u0027s assistant. Sexy, isn\u0027t he?\" His eyes were bright and happy. \"And a real gentleman. In an old-school way.\" \"Who knew there were any of those left?\" I muttered before polishing off my first glass. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"Nothing. I\u0027m sorry, Cary. He seemed great, and he obviously digs you. Is he studying photography?\" \"Veterinary medicine.\" \"Wow. That\u0027s awesome.\" \"I think so, too. But forget about Trey for a minute. Talk about what\u0027s bugging you. Get it out.\" I sighed. \"My mom. She found out about my interest in Parker\u0027s studio and now she\u0027s freaking out.\" \"What? How\u0027d she find out? I swear I haven\u0027t told anyone.\" \"I know you didn\u0027t. Never even crossed my mind.\" Grabbing the bottle off the table, I refilled my glass. \"Get this. She\u0027s been tracking my cell phone.\" Cary\u0027s brows rose. \"Seriously? That\u0027s...creepy.\" \"I know, right? That\u0027s what I told Stanton, but he doesn\u0027t want to hear it.\" \"Well, hell.\" He ran a hand through his long bangs. \"So what do you do?\" \"Get a new phone. And meet with Dr. Petersen to see if he can\u0027t talk some sense into her.\" \"Good move. Turn it over to her shrink. So...is everything okay with your job? Do you still love it?\" \"Totally.\" My head fell back into the sofa cushions and my eyes closed. \"My work and you are my lifesavers right now.\" \"What about the young hottie bazillionaire who wants to nail you? Come on, Eva. You know I\u0027m dying here. What happened?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-16.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
