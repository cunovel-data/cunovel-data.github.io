I loved the intimacy of washing his body as much as I loved the feel of his palms gliding over me. When I took his hand and put it between my legs, urging two of his fingers inside me, I saw the familiar and very welcome heat in his eyes as he felt the slick essence he\u0027d left behind. He kissed me and murmured, \"Mine.\" Which prompted me to slide both hands over his c**k and whisper the same claim back to him. In the bedroom, I lifted my new blue dress off the bed and hugged it to me. \"You picked this out, Gideon?\" \"I did, yes. Do you like it?\" \"It\u0027s beautiful.\" I smiled. \"My mother said you had excellent taste...except for your preference for brunettes.\" He glanced at me just before his very fine, very firm na**d ass disappeared into his massive walk-in closet. \"What brunettes?\" \"Ooh, nicely done.\" \"Look in the top drawer on the right,\" he called out. Was he trying to distract me from thinking about all the brunettes he\u0027d been photographed with - including Magdalene? I left the dress on the bed and opened the drawer. Inside were a dozen Carine Gilson lingerie sets, all in my size, in a wide range of colors. There were also garters and silk stockings still in their packages. I looked up at Gideon as he reappeared with his clothes in hand. \"I have a drawer?\" \"You have three in the dresser and two in the bathroom.\" \"Gideon.\" I smiled. \"Working up to a drawer usually takes a few months.\" \"How would you know?\" He laid his clothes on the bed. \"You\u0027ve lived with a man other than Cary?\" I shot him a look. \"Having a drawer isn\u0027t living with someone.\" \"That\u0027s not an answer.\" He walked over and brushed me gently aside to grab a pair of boxer briefs. Sensing his withdrawal and darkening mood, I replied before he moved away. \"I haven\u0027t lived with any other men, no.\" Leaning over, Gideon pressed a brusque kiss to my forehead before returning to the bed. He paused at the footboard with his back to me. \"I want this relationship to mean more to you than any others you\u0027ve had.\" \"It does. By far.\" I tightened the knot of the towel between my br**sts. \"I\u0027m struggling with that a little. It\u0027s become important so quickly. Maybe too quickly. I keep thinking it\u0027s too good to be true.\" Turning, he faced me. \"Maybe it is. If so, we deserve it.\" I went to him and let him pull me into his arms. It was where I wanted to be more than anywhere else. He pressed a kiss to the crown of my head. \"I can\u0027t stand the thought that you\u0027re waiting for this to end. That\u0027s what you\u0027re doing, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s what you sound like.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"We just have to make you feel secure.\" He ran his fingers through my hair. \"How do we do that?\" I hesitated a moment, then went for it. \"Would you go to couples therapy with me?\" The stroking of his fingers paused. He stood silently for a moment, breathing deeply. \"Just think about it,\" I suggested. \"Maybe look into it, see what it\u0027s about.\" \"Am I doing this wrong? You and me? Am I f**king it up that much?\" I pulled back to look at him. \"No, Gideon. You\u0027re perfect. Perfect for me, anyway. I\u0027m crazy about you. I think you\u0027re - \" He kissed me. \"I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll go.\" I loved him in that moment. Wildly. And the moment after that. And all through the ride to what turned out to be a dazzling, intimate dinner at Masa. We were one of only three parties in the restaurant and Gideon was greeted by name on sight. The food we were served was otherworldly good and the wine too expensive to think about or I wouldn\u0027t have been able to swallow it. Gideon was darkly charismatic; his charm was relaxed and seductive. I felt beautiful in the dress he\u0027d chosen and my mood was light. He knew the worst of what there was to know about me, but he was still with me. His fingertips caressed my shoulder...drew circles on my nape...slid down my back. He kissed my temple and nuzzled beneath my ear, his tongue lightly touching the sensitive skin. Beneath the table, his hand squeezed my thigh and cupped the back of my knee. My entire body vibrated with awareness of him. I wanted him so badly I ached. \"How did you meet Cary?\" he asked, eyeing me over the lip of his wineglass. \"Group therapy.\" I set my hand over his to still its upward slide on my leg, smiling at the mischievous glimmer in his eyes. \"My dad\u0027s a cop and he\u0027d heard of this therapist who supposedly had mad skills with wild kids, which I was. Cary was seeing Dr. Travis, too.\" \"Mad skills, huh?\" Gideon smiled. \"Dr. Travis isn\u0027t like any other therapist I\u0027ve ever met. His office is an old gymnasium he converted. He had an open door policy with \u0027his kids\u0027 and hanging out there was more real to me than lying on a couch. Plus he had a no-bullshit rule. It was straight up honesty both ways or he\u0027d get pissed. I\u0027ve always liked that about him, that he cared enough to get emotional.\" \"Did you choose SDSU because your dad\u0027s in Southern California?\" My mouth twisted wryly as he revealed another bit of knowledge about me that I hadn\u0027t given him. \"How much have you dug up on me?\" \"Whatever I could find.\" \"Do I want to know how extensive that is?\" He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed the back. \"Probably not.\" I shook my head, exasperated. \"Yes, that\u0027s why I attended SDSU. I didn\u0027t get to spend a lot of time with my dad while I was growing up. Plus my mother was smothering me to death.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-56.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
