Pressing my face into his damp throat, I sucked gently on his salty skin. I knew from my own nightmares that being held and loved could push the specters back into the closet for a little while. His arms came around me, his hands running up and down the curve of my spine. I felt him let go of the dream with a long, deep sigh. Pushing him to his back, I climbed over him and sealed my mouth over his. His erection was notched between the lips of my sex and I rocked against him. The feel of his hands in my hair, holding me to take control of the kiss, quickly made me wet and ready. Fire licked just beneath my skin. I stroked my cl*t up and down his thick length, using him to masturbate until he made a rough sound of desire and rolled to put me beneath him. \"I don\u0027t have any condoms in the house,\" he murmured before wrapping his lips around my nipple and sucking gently. I loved that he wasn\u0027t prepared. This wasn\u0027t his f**k pad; this was his home and I was the only lover he\u0027d brought into it. \"I know you mentioned swapping bills of health when we talked about birth control and that\u0027s the responsible way to go, but - \" \"I trust you.\" He lifted his head, looking at me in the faint light of the moon. Kneeing my legs open, he pushed the first bare inch inside me. He was scorching hot and silky soft. \"Eva,\" he breathed, clutching me tightly to him. \"I\u0027ve never...Christ, you feel so good. I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here.\" I tugged his lips down to mine and kissed him. \"Me, too.\" I woke the way I\u0027d fallen asleep, with Gideon on top of me and inside me. His gaze was heavy-lidded with desire as I rose from unconsciousness into heated pleasure. His hair hung around his shoulders and face, looking even sexier for being sleep-tousled. But best of all, there were no shadows in his gorgeous eyes, nothing lingering from the pain that haunted his dreams. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind,\" he murmured with a wicked grin, sliding in and out. \"You\u0027re warm and soft. I can\u0027t help but want you.\" I stretched my arms over my head and arched my back, pressing my br**sts into his chest. Through the slender arch-topped windows, I saw the soft light of dawn fill the sky. \"Umm...I could get used to waking up like this.\" \"That was my thought at three this morning.\" He rolled his h*ps and sank deep into me. \"I thought I\u0027d return the favor.\" My body revved to life, my pulse quickening. \"Yes, please.\" Cary was gone when we got to my apartment, leaving a note behind to tell me he was on a job, but would be back in plenty of time for pizza with Trey. Since I\u0027d been too upset to enjoy my pie the night before, I was ready to try again when I was having a good time. \"I have a business dinner tonight,\" Gideon said, leaning over my shoulder to read. \"I was hoping you\u0027d come with me and make it bearable.\" \"I can\u0027t bail out on Cary,\" I said apologetically, turning to face him. \"Chicks before dicks and all that.\" His mouth twitched and he caged me to the breakfast bar. He was dressed for work in a suit I\u0027d picked out, a graphite gray Prada with a soft sheen. His tie was the blue one that matched his eyes, and as I\u0027d lain on his bed and watched him dress, I\u0027d had to fight the urge to take it all off him. \"Cary isn\u0027t a chick. But I get the point. I want to see you tonight. Can I come over after the dinner and stay the night?\" Heated anticipation rushed through me. I smoothed my hands over his vest, feeling like I had a special secret because I knew exactly what he looked like without his clothes on. \"I\u0027d love it if you did.\" \"Good.\" He gave a satisfied nod. \"I\u0027ll make us coffee, while you get dressed.\" \"The beans are in the freezer. The grinder\u0027s next to the coffee pot.\" I pointed. \"And I like lots of milk and a little sweetener.\" When I came out twenty minutes later, Gideon grabbed two travel mugs of coffee off the breakfast bar and we headed down to the lobby. Paul hustled us out the front door and into the backseat of Gideon\u0027s waiting Bentley SUV. As Gideon\u0027s driver pulled into traffic, Gideon checked me out and said, \"You\u0027re definitely trying to kill me. Are you wearing the garters again?\" Pulling the hem of my skirt up, I showed him where the top of my black silk stockings hooked to my black lace garter belt. His muttered curse made me smile. I\u0027d chosen a black short-sleeved silk turtleneck sweater paired with a decently short pleated skirt in lipstick red and heeled Mary Janes. Because Cary hadn\u0027t been around to manage something fancy with my hair, I\u0027d pulled it back in a ponytail. \"You like?\" \"I\u0027m hard.\" His voice was husky, and he adjusted himself in his trousers. \"How the hell am I going to get through the day thinking about you dressed like that?\" \"There\u0027s always lunch,\" I suggested, fantasizing about a nooner on Gideon\u0027s office couch. \"I have a business lunch today. I\u0027d reschedule, if I hadn\u0027t moved it already yesterday.\" \"You rescheduled an appointment for me? I\u0027m flattered.\" He reached over and brushed his fingertips over my cheek, a now-habitual gesture of affection that was tender and fiercely intimate. I was coming to depend on receiving those touches. I leaned my cheek into his palm. \"Can you carve fifteen minutes out of your day for me?\" \"I\u0027ll manage it.\" \"Call me when you know the time.\" Taking a deep breath, I dug into my bag and wrapped my hand around a gift I wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d want, but I couldn\u0027t get the memory of his nightmare out of my head. I hoped that what I had for him would remind him of me and three A.M. sex, and help him cope. \"I have something. I thought...\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-44.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
