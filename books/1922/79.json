{"id":63291,"no":79,"title":"Page 79","content":"\"Too much?\" I asked hoarsely. \"Yes.\" He set the box down and rounded the desk. \"Too damn much. I can\u0027t sit still, I can\u0027t concentrate. I can\u0027t get you out of my head. I\u0027m f**king restless, and I never am when I\u0027m at work. I\u0027m too busy. But you have me under siege.\" I knew damn well how demanding his work had to be, yet I hadn\u0027t taken that into consideration when the mood to surprise him - again and again - hit me. \"I\u0027m sorry, Gideon. I wasn\u0027t thinking.\" He approached with the sexy stride that hinted at how great he was in the sack. \"Don\u0027t be sorry. Today has been the best day of my life.\" \"Really?\" I watched him slide the ring onto his right ring finger. \"I wanted to please you. Does it fit? I had to guess...\" \"It\u0027s perfect. You\u0027re perfect.\" Gideon caught up my hands and kissed my ring; then watched as I repeated the gesture with his. \"What you make me feel, Eva...it hurts.\" My pulse leaped. \"Is that bad?\" \"It\u0027s wonderful.\" He cupped my face, his ring cool against my cheek. He kissed me passionately, his lips demanding against mine, his tongue thrusting with wicked skill into my mouth. I wanted more, but restrained myself, thinking that I\u0027d already gone overboard enough for one day. Plus, he\u0027d been too distracted by my unexpected appearance to frost the glass wall to give us privacy. \"Tell me again what you said in the car,\" he whispered. \"Hmm...I don\u0027t know.\" I brushed my free hand over his vest. I was afraid to tell him again that I loved him. He\u0027d taken it hard the first time, and I wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d fully taken in what it meant for us. For him. \"You\u0027re ridiculously handsome, you know. It\u0027s a sucker punch every time I see you. Anyway...I don\u0027t want to risk scaring you away.\" Leaning toward me, he touched his forehead to mine. \"You regret what you said, don\u0027t you? All the flowers, the ring - \" \"Do you really like it?\" I asked anxiously, pulling back to study his face and see if he was hedging on the truth. \"I don\u0027t want you to wear it for me if you hate it.\" His fingers traced the shell of my ear. \"It\u0027s perfect. It\u0027s how you see me. I\u0027m proud to wear it.\" I loved that he got it. Of course, that\u0027s because he got me. \"If you\u0027re trying to soften the blow of taking back what you said - \" he began, his gaze betraying a surprising anxiety. I couldn\u0027t resist the soft plea in his eyes. \"I meant every word, Gideon.\" \"I\u0027ll make you say it again,\" he threatened in a seductive purr. \"You\u0027ll scream it by the time I\u0027m done with you.\" I grinned and backed away. \"Get back to work, fiend.\" \"I\u0027ll give you a lift home at five.\" He watched me move to the door. \"I want your cunt na**d and wet when you come down to the car. If you touch yourself to get there, don\u0027t make yourself come or there will be consequences.\" Consequences. A little shiver moved through me, but it carried a level of fear I could deal with. I trusted Gideon to know just how far to push me. \"Will you be hard and ready?\" A wry smile twisted his lips. \"When am I not, with you? Thank you for today, Eva. Every minute of it.\" I blew him a kiss and watched his eyes darken. The look on his face stayed with me the rest of the day. It was six o\u0027clock before I made it back to my apartment in a state of well-fucked dishevelment. I\u0027d known what I was in for when I found Gideon\u0027s limousine at the curb after work instead of the Bentley. He\u0027d damn near tackled me as I climbed into the back; then proceeded to demonstrate his phenomenal oral skills before nailing me into the seat with vigorous enthusiasm. I was grateful that I kept in shape. Otherwise, Gideon\u0027s insatiable sexual appetite combined with his seemingly endless stamina might\u0027ve exhausted me by now. Not that I was complaining. Just an observation. Clancy was already waiting for me in the lobby of my apartment building when I came rushing in. If he noted my hideously wrinkled dress, flushed cheeks, and messy hair, he didn\u0027t point it out. I changed swiftly upstairs and we took off for Parker\u0027s studio. I hoped the orientation would start out easy because my legs were still a bit jellied from two toe-curling orgasms. By the time we arrived at the converted warehouse in Brooklyn, I was excited and ready to learn. About a dozen students were engaged in various exercises with Parker overseeing and offering encouragement from the edge of the mats. When he saw me, he came over and directed me to a far corner of the sparring area where we could work one-on-one. \"So...how\u0027s it going?\" I asked, to break my own tension. He smiled, showing off a very interesting and arresting face. \"Nervous?\" \"A little.\" \"We\u0027re going to work on your physical strength and stamina, as well as your awareness. I\u0027m also going to start training you not to freeze or hesitate in unexpected confrontations.\" Before we began, I thought I had pretty good physical strength and stamina, but I learned both could be better. We started out with a brief introduction to the equipment and layout of the space, and then moved on to an explanation of both fighting and neutral/passive stances. We warmed up with basic bodyweight calisthenics; then progressed to \"tagging,\" where we tried to tag each other\u0027s shoulders and knees while standing face-to-face and blocking countermoves. Parker was amazing at tagging, of course, but I started to get the hang of it. The majority of the time, however, was spent covering groundwork and I really sunk my teeth into that. I knew very well what it was like to be down and at a disadvantage. If Parker noted my underlying vehemence, he didn\u0027t comment on it. When Gideon showed up at my apartment later that evening, he found me soaking my aching body in my bathtub. Although I could tell he was fresh from a shower after his own workout with his personal trainer, he stripped and slid into the bath behind me, cradling me with his arms and legs. I whimpered as he rocked me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-79.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
