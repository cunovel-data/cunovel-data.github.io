{"id":63253,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"Come, Eva,\" he ordered harshly. \"Come now.\"\\n\\n I cl**axed in a rush that had me sobbing his name, the sensation enhanced and magnified by the way he\u0027d confined my body. He threw his head back, shuddering.\\n\\n \"Ah, Eva!\" He clasped me so tightly I couldn\u0027t breathe, his h*ps pumping as he came long and hard.\\n\\n I\u0027ve no idea how long we lay like that, leveled, mouths sliding over shoulders and throats to soothe and calm. My entire body tingled and pulsed.\\n\\n \"Wow,\" I managed finally.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll kill me,\" he muttered with his lips at my jaw. \"We\u0027re going to end up f**king each other to death.\"\\n\\n \"Me? I didn\u0027t do anything.\" He\u0027d controlled me completely and how freakin\u0027 sexy was that?\\n\\n \"You\u0027re breathing. That\u0027s enough.\"\\n\\n I laughed, hugging him.\\n\\n Lifting his head, he nuzzled my nose. \"We\u0027re going to eat, and then we\u0027ll do that again.\"\\n\\n My brows lifted. \"You can do that again?\"\\n\\n \"All night.\" He rolled his h*ps and I could feel that he was still semi-hard.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a machine,\" I told him. \"Or a god.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s you.\" With a soft sweet kiss, he left me. He removed the condom, wrapped it in a tissue from the nightstand, and tossed the whole in the wastebasket by the bed. \"We\u0027ll shower, then order from the restaurant downstairs. Unless you want to go down?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I can walk.\"\\n\\n The flash of his grin stopped my heart for a minute. \"Glad I\u0027m not the only one.\"\\n\\n \"You look fine.\"\\n\\n \"I feel phenomenal.\" He sat back on the side of the bed and brushed my hair back from my forehead. His face was soft, his smile warmly affectionate.\\n\\n I thought I saw something else in his eyes and the possibility closed my throat. It scared me.\\n\\n \"Shower with me,\" he said, running his hand down my arm.\\n\\n \"Gimme me a minute to find my brain, then I\u0027ll join you.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" He went into the bathroom, giving me a prime view of his sculpted back and perfect ass. I sighed with pure female appreciation of a prime male specimen.\\n\\n The water came on in the shower. I managed to sit up and slide my legs over the side of the bed, feeling exquisitely shaky. My gaze caught on the slightly open bedside drawer and I saw condoms through the gap.\\n\\n My stomach twisted. The hotel was too upscale to be the kind that provided condoms along with the requisite Bible.\\n\\n With a slightly trembling hand, I pulled the drawer out further and found a sizable quantity of prophylactics, including a bottle of feminine lubrication and spermicidal gel. My heart started pounding all over again. In my mind, I backtracked through our lust-fueled trip to the hotel. Gideon hadn\u0027t asked which rooms were available. Whether he had a master key or not, he\u0027d need to know which rooms were occupied before he took one...unless he\u0027d known beforehand that this particular room would be empty.\\n\\n Clearly it was his room - a f**k pad outfitted with everything he\u0027d need to have a good time with the women who served that purpose in his life.\\n\\n As I pushed to my feet and walked over to the closet, I heard the glass shower door open in the bathroom, then close. I caught the two knobs of the louvered walnut closet doors and pushed them apart. There was a small selection of men\u0027s clothes hanging on the metal rod, some business shirts and slacks, as well as khakis and jeans. My temperature dropped and a sick misery spread through my orgasmic high.\\n\\n The right side dresser drawers held neatly folded T-shirts, boxer briefs, and socks. The top one on the left side held sex toys still in their packages. I didn\u0027t look at the drawers below that one. I\u0027d seen enough.\\n\\n I pulled on my pants and stole one of Gideon\u0027s shirts. As I dressed, my mind went through the steps I\u0027d learned in therapy: Talk it out. Explain what triggered the negative feelings to your partner. Face the trigger and work through it.\\n\\n Maybe if I\u0027d been less shaken by the depth of my feelings for Gideon, I could have done all that. Maybe if we hadn\u0027t just had mind-blowing sex, I would have felt less raw and vulnerable. I\u0027d never know. What I felt was slightly dirty, a little bit used, and a whole lot hurt. This particular revelation had hit me with excruciating force, and like a child, I wanted to hurt him back.\\n\\n I scooped up the condoms, lube, and toys, and tossed them on the bed. Then, just as he called out my name in an amused and teasing voice, I picked up my bag and left him.\\n\\n Chapter 10\\n\\n I kept my head down as I made the walk of shame past the registration desk and exited the hotel through a side door. I was red-faced with embarrassment remembering the manager who\u0027d greeted Gideon as we got on the elevator. I could only imagine what he\u0027d thought of me. He had to know what Gideon reserved that room for. I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of being the next in a line of many and yet that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027d been from the moment we entered the hotel.\\n\\n How hard would it have been to stop by the front desk and secure a room that was ours alone?\\n\\n I started walking with no direction or destination in mind. It was dark out now, the city taking on a whole new life and energy from what it had during the business day. Steaming food carts dotted the sidewalks, along with a vendor selling framed artwork, another hawking novelty T-shirts, and yet another who had two folding tables covered in movie and television episode scripts.\\n\\n With every step I took, the adrenaline from my flight burned away. The maliciously gleeful thoughts of Gideon coming out of the bathroom to find an empty room and paraphernalia-strewn bed ran their course. I began to calm down...and seriously think about what had just happened.\\n\\n Was it a coincidence that Gideon invited me to a gym that just so happened to be conveniently close to his f**k pad? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-41.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
