I want to f**k you while you\u0027re wearing nothing else.\"\\n\\n Chapter 6\\n\\n \"Hey, Dad. I caught you.\" I adjusted my grip on the phone receiver and pulled up a stool at the breakfast bar. I missed my father. For the last four years we\u0027d lived close enough to see each other at least once a week. Now his home in Oceanside was the entire country away. \"How are you?\"\\n\\n He lowered the volume on the television. \"Better, now that you\u0027ve called. How was your first week at work?\"\\n\\n I went over my days from Monday through Friday, skipping over all the Gideon parts. \"I really like my boss, Mark,\" I finished. \"And the vibe of the agency is very energetic and kind of quirky. I\u0027m happy going to work every day, and I\u0027m bummed when it\u0027s time to go home.\"\\n\\n \"I hope it stays that way. But you need to make sure you have some downtime, too. Go out, be young, have fun. But not too much fun.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I had a little too much last night. Cary and I went clubbing, and I woke up with a mean hangover.\"\\n\\n \"Shit, don\u0027t tell me that.\" He groaned. \"Some nights I wake up in a cold sweat thinking about you in New York. I get through it by telling myself you\u0027re too smart to take chances, thanks to two parents who\u0027ve drilled safety rules into your DNA.\"\\n\\n \"Which is true,\" I said, laughing. \"That reminds me...I\u0027m going to start Krav Maga training.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" There was a thoughtful pause. \"One of the guys on the force is big on it. Maybe I\u0027ll check it out and we can compare notes when I come out to visit you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re coming to New York?\" I couldn\u0027t hide my excitement. \"Oh, Dad, I\u0027d love it if you would. As much as I miss SoCal, Manhattan is really awesome. I think you\u0027ll like it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like anyplace in the world as long as you\u0027re there.\" He waited a beat, then asked, \"How\u0027s your mom?\"\\n\\n \"Well...she\u0027s Mom. Beautiful, charming, and obsessive-compulsive.\"\\n\\n My chest hurt and I rubbed at it. I thought my dad might still love my mom. He\u0027d never married. That was one of the reasons I never told him about what happened to me. As a cop, he would\u0027ve insisted on pressing charges and the scandal would have destroyed my mother. I also worried that he\u0027d lose respect for her or even blame her, and it hadn\u0027t been her fault. As soon as she\u0027d found out what her stepson was doing to me, she\u0027d left a husband she was happy with and filed for divorce.\\n\\n I kept talking, waving at Cary as he came rushing in with a little blue Tiffany \u0026 Co. bag. \"We had a spa day today. It was a fun way to cap off the week.\"\\n\\n I could hear the smile in his voice when he said, \"I\u0027m glad you two are managing to spend time together. What are your plans for the rest of the weekend?\"\\n\\n I hedged on the subject of the charity event, knowing the whole red carpet business and astronomically-priced dinner seats would just highlight the gap between my parents\u0027 lives. \"Cary and I are going out to eat, and then I plan on staying in tomorrow. Sleeping in late, hanging out in my pajamas all day, maybe some movies and food delivery of some sort. A little vegetating before a new work week kicks off.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like heaven to me. I may copy you when my next day off rolls around.\"\\n\\n Glancing at the clock, I saw it was creeping past six. \"I have to get ready now. Be careful at work, okay? I worry about you, too.\"\\n\\n \"Will do. Bye, baby.\"\\n\\n The familiar sign-off had me missing him so much my throat hurt. \"Oh, wait! I\u0027m getting a new cell phone. I\u0027ll text you the number as soon as I have it.\"\\n\\n \"Again? You just got a new one when you moved.\"\\n\\n \"Long, boring story.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm...Don\u0027t put it off. They\u0027re good for safety as well as playing Angry Birds.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m over that game!\" I laughed and warmth spread through me to hear him laughing, too. \"I\u0027ll call you in a few days. Be good.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my line.\"\\n\\n We hung up. I sat for a few moments in the ensuing silence, feeling like everything was right in my world, which never lasted long. I brooded on that for minute; then Cary cranked up Hinder on his bedroom stereo and that kicked my butt into gear.\\n\\n I hurried to my room to get ready for a night with Gideon.\\n\\n \"Necklace or no necklace?\" I asked Cary, when he came into my bedroom looking seriously amazing. Dressed in his new Brioni tux, he was both debonair and dashing, and certain to attract attention.\\n\\n \"Hmm.\" His head tilted to the side as he studied me. \"Hold it up again.\"\\n\\n I lifted the choker of gold coins to my throat. The dress my mom had sent was fire engine red and styled for a Grecian goddess. It hung on one shoulder, cut diagonally across my cle**age, had ruching to the hip, and then split at my right upper thigh all the way down my leg. There was no back to speak of, aside from a slender strip of rhinestones that connected one side to the other to keep the front from falling off. Otherwise, the back was bared to just above the crack of my bu**ocks in a racy V-cut.\\n\\n \"Forget the necklace,\" he said. \"I was leaning toward gold chandeliers, but now I\u0027m thinking diamond hoops. The biggest ones you\u0027ve got.\"\\n\\n \"What? Really?\" I frowned at our reflections in my cheval mirror, watching as he moved to my jewelry box and dug through it.\\n\\n \"These.\" He brought them to me and I eyed the two-inch hoops my mother had given me for my eighteenth birthday. \"Trust me, Eva. Try \u0027em on.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-24.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
