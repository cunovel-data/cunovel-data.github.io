It\u0027s just...\" I exhaled in a rush. \"Listen, I have something for you, but I just realized it\u0027s one of those gifts - well, it\u0027s not really a gift. I\u0027m already thinking it\u0027s not appropriate and - \"\\n\\n He thrust out his hand. \"Give it to me.\"\\n\\n \"You can totally decide not to take it - \"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Eva.\" He crooked his fingers. \"Give it to me.\"\\n\\n I pulled it out of my bag and handed it over.\\n\\n Gideon stared down at the framed photograph in complete silence. It was a novelty frame depicting die-cut images of things relating to graduation, including a digital clock face that read 3:00 A.M. The picture was of me posing on Coronado Beach in a coral bikini with a big floppy straw hat - I was tanned, happy, and blowing a kiss to Cary, who\u0027d playacted the role of a high-fashion photographer by calling out ridiculous encouragements. Beautiful, dahling. Show me sassy. Show me sexy. Brilliant. Show me catty...rawr...\\n\\n Embarrassed, I squirmed a little on the seat. \"Like I said, you don\u0027t have to keep - \"\\n\\n \"I - \" He cleared his throat. \"Thank you, Eva.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, well...\" I was grateful to see the Crossfire outside my window. I jumped out quickly when the driver pulled over and ran my hands over my skirt, feeling self-conscious. \"If you want, I can hang on to it until later.\"\\n\\n Gideon shut the door of the Bentley and shook his head. \"It\u0027s mine. You\u0027re not taking it back.\"\\n\\n He linked our fingers together and gestured toward the revolving door with the hand holding the frame. I warmed when I realized he intended to take my picture into work with him.\\n\\n One of the fun things about the ad business was that no day was ever the same as the one before it. I was hopping all morning and was just beginning to contemplate what to do about lunch when my phone rang. \"Mark Garrity\u0027s office, Eva Tramell speaking.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got news,\" Cary said by way of greeting.\\n\\n \"What?\" I could tell by his voice that it was good news, whatever it was.\\n\\n \"I landed a Grey Isles campaign.\"\\n\\n \"Oh my God! Cary, that\u0027s awesome! I love their jeans.\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing for lunch?\"\\n\\n I grinned. \"Celebrating with you. Can you be here at noon?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m already on my way.\"\\n\\n I hung up and rocked back in my chair, so thrilled for Cary I felt like dancing. Needing something to do to kill the fifteen minutes remaining before my lunch break, I checked my inbox again and found a Google alert digest for Gideon\u0027s name. Over thirty mentions, in just one day.\\n\\n I opened the e-mail and freaked out a little at the numerous \"mystery woman\" headlines. I clicked on the first link and found myself landing on a gossip blog.\\n\\n There, in living color, was a photo of Gideon kissing me senseless on the sidewalk outside of his gym. The accompanying article was short and to the point:\\n\\n \"Gideon Cross, New York\u0027s most eligible bachelor since John F. Kennedy Jr., was spotted yesterday in a passionate public embrace. A source at Cross Industries identified the lucky mystery woman as socialite Eva Tramell, daughter of multimillionaire Richard Stanton and his wife, Monica. When queried about the nature of the relationship between Cross and Tramell, the source confirmed that Miss Tramell is \u0027the significant woman\u0027 in the mogul\u0027s life at present. We imagine hearts are breaking across the country this morning.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, crap,\" I breathed.\\n\\n Chapter 11\\n\\n I quickly clicked through other links in the digest to find the same picture with similar captions and articles. Alarmed, I sat back and thought about what this meant. If one kiss was headline news, what chance would Gideon and I have to make a relationship work?\\n\\n My hands weren\u0027t quite steady as I closed the browser tabs. I hadn\u0027t considered the press coverage, but I should have. \"Damn it.\"\\n\\n Anonymity was my friend. It protected me from my past. It protected my family from embarrassment, and Gideon, too. I didn\u0027t even have any social networking accounts so people who weren\u0027t actively in my life couldn\u0027t find me.\\n\\n A thin, invisible wall between me and exposure was gone.\\n\\n \"Hell,\" I breathed, finding myself in a painful situation I could have avoided if I\u0027d dedicated any of my brain cells to something other than Gideon.\\n\\n There was also his reaction to this mess to consider...I cringed inwardly just thinking about it. And my mother. It wouldn\u0027t be long before she was calling and blowing everything out of -\\n\\n \"Shit.\" Remembering that she didn\u0027t have my new cell number, I picked up my desk phone and called my other voice mail to see if she\u0027d already tried to reach me. I winced when I heard that my mailbox was full.\\n\\n I hung up and grabbed my purse; then headed off to lunch, knowing Cary would help me put it all in perspective. I was so flustered when I reached the lobby level that I rushed out of the elevator with my only thought being to find my roommate. When I spotted him, I didn\u0027t take note of anyone else until Gideon sidestepped smoothly in front of me and blocked my path.\\n\\n \"Eva.\" He frowned down at me. Cupping my elbow, he turned me slightly around. That\u0027s when I saw the two women and a man who\u0027d hidden him from my view.\\n\\n I managed to find a smile for them. \"Hello.\"\\n\\n Gideon introduced me to his lunch dates. Then he excused us and tugged me off to the side. \"What\u0027s wrong? You\u0027re upset.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all over the place,\" I whispered. \"A picture of us together.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I\u0027ve seen it.\"\\n\\n I blinked up at him, confused at his nonchalance. \"You\u0027re okay with it?\"\\n\\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t I be? For once, they\u0027re reporting the truth.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-45.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
