I\u0027m a big girl. Besides, nothing is going to get me to quit this job.\"\\n\\n He blew out his breath, clearly relieved. \"All right. Let\u0027s put it away and get to work.\"\\n\\n So we did, but I set myself up for future torture by subscribing to a daily Google alert for Gideon\u0027s name. And when five o\u0027clock rolled around, my awareness of my many inadequacies was still spreading through my happiness like a stain.\\n\\n Gideon was as prompt as he\u0027d threatened to be and he didn\u0027t seem to notice my introspective mood as we rode down in a crowded elevator. More than one woman in the car cast furtive glances in his direction, but that sort of thing I didn\u0027t mind. He was hot. I would\u0027ve been surprised if they hadn\u0027t looked.\\n\\n He caught my hand when we cleared the turnstiles, linking his fingers with mine. The simple, intimate gesture meant so much to me in that moment that my grip tightened on his. And I\u0027d really have to watch out for that. The moment I became grateful he was spending time with me would be the beginning of the end. Neither of us would respect me if that happened.\\n\\n The Bentley SUV sat at the curb and Gideon\u0027s driver stood at the ready by the rear door. Gideon looked at me. \"I had some workout clothes packed and brought over, in case you were set on visiting your gym. Equinox, right? Or we can go to mine.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s yours?\"\\n\\n \"I prefer to go to the CrossTrainer on Thirty-fifth.\"\\n\\n My curiosity over how he knew which gym I frequented vanished when I heard the \"Cross\" in the name of his gym. \"You wouldn\u0027t happen to own the gym, would you?\"\\n\\n His grin flashed. \"The chain. Usually, I practice mixed martial arts with a personal trainer, but I use the gym occasionally.\"\\n\\n \"The chain,\" I repeated. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"Your choice,\" he said considerately. \"I\u0027ll go wherever you want.\"\\n\\n \"By all means, let\u0027s go to your gym.\"\\n\\n He opened the back door, and I slid in and over. I set my purse and my gym bag on my lap, and looked out the window as the car pulled away from the curb. The sedan driving next to us was so close I wouldn\u0027t have to lean far to touch it. Rush hour in Manhattan was something I was still getting used to. SoCal had bumper-to-bumper traffic, too, but it moved at a snail\u0027s pace. Here in New York, speed mixed with the crush in a way that often made me close my eyes and pray to survive the trip.\\n\\n It was a whole new world. A new city, new apartment, new job, and new man. It was a lot to take on at once. I supposed it was understandable that I felt off-balance.\\n\\n I glanced at Gideon and found him staring at me with an unreadable expression. Everything inside me twisted into a mess of wild lust and vibrating anxiety. I had no idea what I was doing with him, only that I couldn\u0027t stop even if I wanted to.\\n\\n Chapter 9\\n\\n We hit the cellular store first. The associate who helped us seemed highly susceptible to Gideon\u0027s magnetic pull. She practically fell all over herself the minute he showed the slightest interest in anything, quickly launching into detailed explanations and leaning into his personal space to demonstrate.\\n\\n I tried separating from them and finding someone who\u0027d actually help me, but Gideon\u0027s grip on my hand wouldn\u0027t let me move more than touching distance away. Then we argued over who was going to pay, which he seemed to think should be him even though the phone and account were mine.\\n\\n \"You got your way with picking the service provider,\" I pointed out, pushing his credit card aside and shoving mine at the girl.\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s practical. We\u0027ll be on the same network, so calls to me are free.\" He swapped the cards deftly.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t be calling you at all, if you don\u0027t put your damn credit card away!\"\\n\\n That did the trick, although I could tell he was unhappy about it. He\u0027d just have to get over it.\\n\\n Once we got back in the Bentley, his mood seemed restored.\\n\\n \"You can head to the gym now, Angus,\" he told his driver, settling back in the seat. Then he pulled his smartphone out of his pocket. He saved my new number into his contact list; then he took my new phone out of my hand and programmed my list with his home, office, and cell numbers.\\n\\n He\u0027d barely finished when we arrived at CrossTrainer. Not surprisingly, the three-story fitness center was a health enthusiast\u0027s dream. I was impressed with every sleek, modern, top-of-the-line inch of it. Even the women\u0027s locker room was like something out of a science fiction movie.\\n\\n But my awe was totally eclipsed by Gideon himself when I finished changing into my workout clothes and found him waiting for me out in the hallway. He\u0027d changed into long shorts and a tank, which gave me my first look at his bare arms and legs.\\n\\n I came to an abrupt halt and someone coming out behind me bumped into me. I could barely manage an apology; I was too busy visually devouring Gideon\u0027s smokin\u0027 hot body. His legs were toned and powerful, flawlessly proportional to his trim h*ps and waist. His arms made my mouth water. His biceps were precisely cut and his forearms were coursing with thick veins that were both brutal looking and sexy as hell. He\u0027d tied his hair back, which showed off the definition of his neck and traps, and the sculpted angles of his face.\\n\\n Christ. I knew this man intimately. My brain couldn\u0027t wrap itself around that fact, not while faced with the irrefutable evidence of how uniquely beautiful he was.\\n\\n And he was scowling at me.\\n\\n Straightening away from the wall where he\u0027d been leaning, he came toward me, and then circled me. His fingertips ran along my bare midriff and back as he made the revolution, sending goose bumps racing over my skin. When he stopped in front of me, I threw my arms around his neck and pulled his mouth down for a quick, playfully smacking kiss. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-37.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
