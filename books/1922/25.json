And the earrings went well with the diamond anklet on my right leg that I\u0027d never think of the same way again after Gideon\u0027s comment. With my hair swept off my face into a cascade of thick, deliberately messy curls, I had a just-screwed look that was complemented by smoky eye shadow and glossy nude lips. \"What would I do without you, Cary Taylor?\" \"Baby girl\" - he set his hands on my shoulders and pressed his cheek to mine - \"you\u0027ll never find out.\" \"You look awesome, by the way.\" \"Don\u0027t I?\" He winked and stepped back, showing off. In his own way, Cary could give Gideon a run for his money...er, looks. Cary was more finely featured, almost pretty compared to Gideon\u0027s savage beauty, but both were striking men that made you look twice, and then stare in greedy delight. Cary hadn\u0027t been quite so perfect when I met him. He\u0027d been strung out and gaunt, his emerald eyes cloudy and lost. But I\u0027d been drawn to him, going out of my way to sit next to him in group therapy. He\u0027d finally propositioned me crudely, having come to believe the only reason people associated with him was because they wanted to f**k him. It was when I declined, firmly and irrevocably, that we finally connected and became best friends. He was the brother I\u0027d never had. The intercom buzzed and I jumped, making me realize how nervous I was. I looked at Cary. \"I forgot to tell the front desk he was coming back.\" \"I\u0027ll get him.\" \"Are you going to be okay riding over with Stanton and my mom?\" \"Are you kidding? They love me.\" His smile dimmed. \"Having second thoughts about going with Cross?\" I took a deep breath, remembering where I\u0027d been earlier - on my back in a multi-orgasmic daze. \"Not really, no. It\u0027s just that everything\u0027s happening so fast and going better than I expected or realized I wanted...\" \"You\u0027re wondering what the catch is.\" Reaching out, he tapped my nose with his fingertip. \"He\u0027s the catch, Eva. And you landed him. Enjoy yourself.\" \"I\u0027m trying.\" I was grateful that Cary understood me and the way my mind worked. It was just so easy being with him, knowing he could fill in the blanks when I couldn\u0027t explain something. \"I researched the hell out of him this morning and printed out the interesting recent stuff. It\u0027s on your desk, if you decide you want to check it out.\" I remembered him printing something before we got ready for the spa. Pushing onto my tiptoes, I kissed his cheek. \"You\u0027re the best. I love you.\" \"Back atcha, baby girl.\" He headed out. \"I\u0027ll head down to the front desk and bring him up. Take your time. He\u0027s ten minutes early.\" Smiling, I watched him saunter into the hallway. The door had closed behind him when I moved into the small sitting room attached to my bedroom. On the very impractical escritoire my mother had picked out, I found a folder filled with articles and printed images. I settled into the chair and got lost in Gideon Cross\u0027s history. It was like watching a train wreck to read that he was the son of Geoffrey Cross, former chairman of an investment securities firm later found to be a front for a massive Ponzi scheme. Gideon was just five years old when his dad committed suicide with a gunshot to the head rather than face prison time. Oh, Gideon. I tried to picture him that young and imagined a handsome dark-haired boy with beautiful blue eyes filled with terrible confusion and sadness. The image broke my heart. How devastating his father\u0027s suicide - and the circumstances around it - must have been, for both him and his mother. The stress and strain at such a difficult time would\u0027ve been enormous, especially for a child of that age. His mother went on to marry Christopher Vidal, a music executive, and had two more children, Christopher Vidal Jr. and Ireland Vidal, but it seemed a larger family and financial security had come too late to help Gideon stabilize after such a huge shakeup. He was too closed off not to bear some painful emotional scars. With a critical and curious eye, I studied the women who\u0027d been photographed with Gideon and thought about his approach to dating, socializing, and sex. I saw that my mom had been right - they were all brunettes. The woman who appeared with him most often bore the hallmarks of a Hispanic heritage. She was taller than me, willowy rather than curvy. \"Magdalene Perez,\" I murmured, grudgingly admitting that she was a stunner. Her posture had the kind of flamboyant confidence that I admired. \"Okay, it\u0027s been long enough,\" Cary interrupted with a soft note of amusement. He filled the doorway to my sitting room, leaning insolently into the doorjamb. \"Really?\" I\u0027d been so absorbed; I hadn\u0027t realized how much time had passed. \"I would guess you\u0027re about a minute away from him coming to find you. He\u0027s barely restraining himself.\" I shut the folder and stood. \"Interesting reading, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Very.\" How had Gideon\u0027s father - or more specifically, his father\u0027s suicide - influenced his life? I knew all the answers I wanted were waiting for me in the next room. Leaving my bedroom, I took the hallway to the living room. I paused on the threshold, my gaze riveted to Gideon\u0027s back as he stood in front of the windows and looked out at the city. My heart rate kicked up. His reflection revealed a contemplative mood. His gaze was unfocused and his mouth grim. His crossed arms betrayed an inherent unease, as if he was out of his element. He looked remote and removed, a man who was inherently alone. He sensed my presence or maybe he felt my yearning. He pivoted; then went very still. I took the opportunity to drink him in, my gaze sliding all over him. He looked every inch the powerful magnate. So sensually handsome my eyes burned just from looking at him. The rakish fall of black hair around his face made my fingers flex with the urge to touch it. And the way he looked at me...my pulse leaped.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-25.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
