I wouldn\u0027t survive you otherwise.\"\\n\\n And still that fingertip massaged me, spurring a dark yearning. Gideon could do that to me, make me forget everything that happened before. I had no negative sexual triggers with him, no hesitation or fears. He\u0027d given that to me. In return, I wanted to give him the body he\u0027d freed from my past.\\n\\n The long case clock near the door began to chime the hour.\\n\\n \"Gideon, we\u0027ve been gone a long time. Someone will come looking for us.\"\\n\\n He put the slightest pressure against my sensitive rosette, barely pressing. \"Do you really care if they do?\"\\n\\n My h*ps arched into the touch. Anticipation was making me hot all over again. \"I don\u0027t care about anything but you when you\u0027re touching me.\"\\n\\n His free hand lifted to my hair and held it at the roots, keeping my head still. \"Did you ever enjoy anal play? Accidentally or by deliberation?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"And yet you trust me enough to ask me for this.\" He kissed my forehead as he drew the slickness of his se**n back to my rear.\\n\\n I gripped his waistband. \"You don\u0027t have to - \"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do.\" His voice had that wickedly assertive bite to it. \"If you crave something, I\u0027ll be the one to give it to you. All of your needs, Eva, are mine to fulfill. Whatever it costs me.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Gideon.\" My h*ps shifted restlessly as he continued to lubricate me gently. \"I want to be what you need, too.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve told you what I need, Eva - control.\" He brushed his parted lips back and forth over mine. \"You\u0027re asking me to lead you back into painful places and I will, if that\u0027s what you need. But we have to be extremely careful.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Trust is hard for both of us. If we break it, we could lose everything. Think of a word you associate with power. Your safeword, angel. Choose it.\"\\n\\n The pressure of that single fingertip became more insistent. I moaned, \"Crossfire.\"\\n\\n \"Umm...I like it. Very fitting.\" His tongue dipped into my mouth, barely touching mine before retreating. His finger rimmed my anus over and over, pushing his se**n into the puckered hole, a soft growl escaping him as it flexed in a silent plea for more.\\n\\n The next time he pressed against the ring, I pushed out and he slipped his fingertip inside me. The feeling of penetration was shockingly intense.\\n\\n Just as before, surrender weighted my body, leaving me languid.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" Gideon asked harshly as I sagged against him. \"Should I stop?\"\\n\\n \"No...Don\u0027t stop.\"\\n\\n He pushed fractionally deeper and I clenched around him, a helpless reaction to the feel of something gliding across tender tissues. \"You\u0027re snug and scorching hot,\" he murmured. \"And so soft. Does it hurt?\"\\n\\n \"No. Please. More.\"\\n\\n Gideon withdrew to his fingertip; then slid in to the knuckle, slow and easy. I quivered in delight, astonished by how good it felt, that teasing bit of fullness in my rear.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s that?\" he asked hoarsely.\\n\\n \"Good. Everything you do to me feels good.\"\\n\\n He withdrew again, glided deep again. Leaning forward, I thrust my h*ps back to give him easier access and pressed my br**sts against his chest. His fist in my hair tightened, pulling my head back so he could take my mouth in a lush, wet kiss. Our open mouths slid across each other, growing more frantic as my arousal built. The feel of Gideon\u0027s finger in that darkly sexual place, thrusting in that gentle rhythm, had me rocking backward to meet his inward drives.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so beautiful,\" he murmured, his voice infinitely gentle. \"I love making you feel good. Love watching an orgasm move through your body.\"\\n\\n \"Gideon.\" I was lost, drowning in the powerful joy of being held by him, loved by him. Four days alone had taught me how miserable I\u0027d be if we couldn\u0027t work things out, how dull and colorless my world would be without him in it. \"I need you.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" He licked across my lips, making my head spin. \"I\u0027m here. Your cunt\u0027s trembling and tightening. You\u0027re going to come for me again.\"\\n\\n With shaking hands, I reached between us for his cock, finding it hard. I lifted the layers of my underskirts so I could insert him into my drenched sex. He slid in a few inches, our standing positions preventing deeper penetration, but the connection alone was enough. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders, burying my face in his neck as my knees weakened. His hand left my hair, his arm clasping my back and holding me close.\\n\\n \"Eva.\" The tempo of his finger thrusts quickened. \"Do you know what you do to me?\"\\n\\n His h*ps nudged against mine, the wide crest of his penis massaging a sweetly tender spot. \"You\u0027re milking the head of my dick with those hungry little squeezes. You\u0027re going to make me come for you. When you go off, I\u0027m going with you.\"\\n\\n I was distantly aware of the helpless noises spilling from my throat. My senses were overloaded by Gideon\u0027s scent and the heat of his hard body, the feel of his c**k rubbing inside me and his finger pumping into my rear. I was surrounded by him, filled with him, blissfully possessed in every way. A cl**ax was building in force, pounding through me, pooling in my core. Not just from the physical pleasure but from the knowledge that he\u0027d been willing to take a risk. Once again. For me.\\n\\n His finger stilled and I made a sound of protest.\\n\\n \"Hush,\" he whispered. \"Someone\u0027s coming.\"\\n\\n \"Oh God! Magdalene came in earlier and saw us. What if she told - \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t move.\" Gideon didn\u0027t let me go. He stood just as he was, filling me front and back, his hand caressing the length of my spine and smoothing my dress down. \"Your skirts hide everything.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-69.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
