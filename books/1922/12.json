{"id":63224,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I stepped out, deciding it would be safer for my sanity to take a different car up. \"Not so fast, Eva.\" Cross caught me by the elbow and tugged me back. The doors shut and the elevator glided smoothly into motion. \"What are you doing?\" I snapped. After dealing with Stanton, the last thing I needed was another domineering male trying to push me around. Cross caught me by the upper arms and searched my face with that vivid blue gaze. \"Something\u0027s wrong. What is it?\" The now-familiar electricity crackled to life between us, the pull made fiercer by my temper. \"You.\" \"Me?\" His thumbs stroked over my shoulders. Releasing me, he withdrew a lone key from his pocket and plugged it into the panel. All the lights cleared except for the one for the top floor. He wore black again, with fine gray pinstripes. Seeing him from the back was a revelation. His shoulders were nicely broad without being bulky, emphasizing his lean waist and long legs. The silky strands of hair falling over his collar tempted me to clench them and pull. Hard. I wanted him as pissy as I was. I wanted a fight. \"I\u0027m not in the mood for you now, Mr. Cross.\" He watched the antique-style needle above the doors mark the passing floors. \"I can get you in the mood.\" \"I\u0027m not interested.\" Cross glanced over his shoulder at me. His shirt and tie were both the same awesome cerulean as his irises. The effect was striking. \"No lies, Eva. Ever.\" \"That\u0027s not a lie. So what if I\u0027m attracted to you? I expect most women are.\" Wrapping up what was left of my candy bar, I shoved it back into the shopping bag I\u0027d tucked into my purse. I didn\u0027t need chocolate when I was sharing air with Gideon Cross. \"But I\u0027m not interested in doing anything about it.\" He faced me then, turning in a leisurely pivot, that ghost of a smile softening his sinful mouth. His ease and unconcern aggravated me further. \"Attraction is too tame a word for\" - he gestured at the space between us - \"this.\" \"Call me crazy, but I have to actually like someone before I get na**d and sweaty with them.\" \"Not crazy,\" he said. \"But I don\u0027t have the time or the inclination to date.\" \"That makes two of us. Glad we got that cleared up.\" He stepped closer, his hand lifting to my face. I forced myself not to move away or give him the satisfaction of seeing me intimidated. His thumb brushed over the corner of my mouth; then lifted to his own. He sucked on the pad and purred, \"Chocolate and you. Delicious.\" A shiver moved through me, followed by a heated ache between my legs as I imagined licking chocolate off his lethally sexy body. His gaze darkened and his voice lowered intimately. \"Romance isn\u0027t in my repertoire, Eva. But a thousand ways to make you come are. Let me show you.\" The car slowed to a halt. He withdrew the key from the panel and the doors opened. I backed into the corner and shooed him out with a flick of my wrist. \"I\u0027m really not interested.\" \"We\u0027ll discuss.\" Cross caught me by the elbow and gently, but insistently, urged me out. I went along because I liked the charge I got from being around him and because I was curious to see what he had to say when afforded more than five minutes of my time. He was buzzed through the security door so quickly there was no need for him to break stride. The pretty redhead at the reception desk pushed hastily to her feet, about to impart some information until he shook his head impatiently. Her mouth snapped shut and she stared at me as we passed at a brisk pace, her eyes wide. The walk to Cross\u0027s office was mercifully short. His secretary stood when he saw his boss\u0027s approach, but remained silent when he noted that Cross wasn\u0027t alone. \"Hold my calls, Scott,\" Cross said, steering me into his office through the open glass double doors. Despite my irritation, I couldn\u0027t help but be impressed with Gideon Cross\u0027s spacious command center. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked the city on two sides, while a wall of glass faced the rest of the office space. The one opaque wall opposite the massive desk was covered in flat screens streaming news channels from around the world. There were three distinct seating areas, each one larger than Mark\u0027s entire office, and a bar that showcased jeweled crystal decanters, which provided the only spots of color in a palette that was otherwise black, gray, and white. Cross hit a button on his desk that closed the doors; then another that instantly frosted the clear glass wall, effectively shielding us from the view of his employees. With the beautiful sapphire-hued reflective film on the exterior windows, privacy was assured. He shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on a chrome coatrack. Then he returned to where I\u0027d remained standing just inside the doors. \"Something to drink, Eva?\" \"No, thank you.\" Damn it. He was even yummier in just the vest. I could better see how fit he was. How strong his shoulders were. How beautifully his biceps and ass flexed as he moved. He gestured toward a black leather sofa. \"Have a seat.\" \"I have to go back to work.\" \"And I have a meeting at two. The sooner we work this out, the sooner we can both get back to business. Now, sit down.\" \"What do you think we\u0027re going to work out?\" Sighing, he scooped me up like a bride and carried me over to the sofa. He dropped me on my butt; then sat next to me. \"Your objections. It\u0027s time to discuss what it\u0027s going to take to get you beneath me.\" \"A miracle.\" I pushed back from him, widening the space between us. I tugged at the hem of my emerald green skirt, wishing I\u0027d worn pants instead. \"I find your approach crude and offensive.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-12.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
