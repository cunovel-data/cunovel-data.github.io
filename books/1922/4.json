{"id":63216,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Hmm...I caught the handle of the spoon sticking out of the bowl and decided not to comment on the food. \"I think I ran into the hottest man on the planet today. Maybe the hottest man in the history of the world.\" \"Oh? I thought that was me. Do tell me more.\" Cary stayed on the other side of the counter, preferring to stand and eat. I watched him take a couple bites of his own concoction before I felt brave enough to try it myself. \"Not much to tell, really. I ended up sprawled on my ass in the lobby of the Crossfire and he gave me a hand up.\" \"Tall or short? Blond or dark? Built or lean? Eye color?\" I washed down my second bite with some wine. \"Tall. Dark. Lean and built. Blue eyes. Filthy rich, judging by his clothes and accessories. And he was insanely sexy. You know how it is - some hot guys don\u0027t make your hormones go crazy, while some unattractive guys have massive sex appeal. This guy had it all.\" My belly fluttered as it had when Dark and Dangerous touched me. In my mind, I remembered his breathtaking face with crystal clarity. It should be illegal for a man to be that mind-blowing. I was still recovering from the frying of my brain cells. Cary set his elbow on the counter and leaned in, his long bangs covering one vibrant green eye. \"So what happened after he helped you up?\" I shrugged. \"Nothing.\" \"Nothing?\" \"I left.\" \"What? You didn\u0027t flirt with him?\" I took another bite. Really, the meal wasn\u0027t bad. Or else I was just starving. \"He wasn\u0027t the kind of guy you flirt with, Cary.\" \"There is no such thing as a guy you can\u0027t flirt with. Even the happily married ones enjoy a little harmless flirtation now and then.\" \"There was nothing harmless about this guy,\" I said dryly. \"Ah, one of those.\" Cary nodded sagely. \"Bad boys can be fun, if you don\u0027t get too close.\" Of course he would know; men and women of all ages fell at his feet. Still, he somehow managed to pick the wrong partner every time. He\u0027d dated stalkers, and cheaters, and lovers who threatened to kill themselves over him, and lovers with significant others they didn\u0027t tell him about...Name it, he\u0027d been through it. \"I can\u0027t see this guy ever being fun,\" I said. \"He was way too intense. Still, I bet he\u0027d be awesome in the sack with all that intensity.\" \"Now you\u0027re talking. Forget the real guy. Just use his face in your fantasies and make him perfect there.\" Preferring to get the guy out of my head altogether, I changed the subject. \"You have any go-sees tomorrow?\" \"Of course.\" Cary launched into the details of his schedule, mentioning a jeans advertisement, self-tanner, underwear, and cologne. I shoved everything else out of my mind and focused on him and his growing success. The demand for Cary Taylor was increasing by the day, and he was building a reputation with photographers and accounts for being both professional and prompt. I was thrilled for him and so proud. He\u0027d come a long way and been through so much. It wasn\u0027t until after dinner that I noticed the two large gift boxes propped against the side of the sectional sofa. \"What are those?\" \"Those,\" Cary said, joining me in the living room, \"are the ultimate.\" I knew immediately they were from Stanton and my mom. Money was something my mother needed to be happy and I was glad Stanton, husband #3, was not only able to fill that need for her but all her many others as well. I often wished that could be the end of it, but my mom had a difficult time accepting that I didn\u0027t view money the same way she did. \"What now?\" He threw his arm around my shoulders, easy enough for him to do because he was taller by five inches. \"Don\u0027t be ungrateful. He loves your mom. He loves spoiling your mom, and your mom loves spoiling you. As much as you don\u0027t like it, he doesn\u0027t do it for you. He does it for her.\" Sighing, I conceded his point. \"What are they?\" \"Glam threads for the advocacy center\u0027s fundraiser dinner on Saturday. A bombshell dress for you and a Brioni tux for me, because buying gifts for me is what he does for you. You\u0027re more tolerant if you have me around to listen to you bitch.\" \"Damn straight. Thank God he knows that.\" \"Of course he knows. Stanton wouldn\u0027t be a bazillionaire if he didn\u0027t know everything.\" Cary caught my hand and tugged me over. \"Come on. Take a look.\" I pushed through the revolving door of the Crossfire into the lobby ten minutes before nine the next morning. Wanting to make the best impression on my first day, I\u0027d gone with a simple sheath dress paired with black pumps that I slid on in replacement of my walking shoes on the elevator ride up. My blond hair was twisted up in an artful chignon that resembled a figure eight, courtesy of Cary. I was hair-inept, but he could create styles that were glamorous masterpieces. I wore the small pearl studs my dad had given me as a graduation gift and the Rolex from Stanton and my mother. I had begun to think I\u0027d put too much care into my appearance, but as I stepped into the lobby I remembered being sprawled across the floor in my workout clothes and I was grateful I didn\u0027t look anything like that graceless girl. The two security guards didn\u0027t seem to put two and two together when I flashed them my ID card on the way to the turnstiles. Twenty floors later, I was exiting into the vestibule of Waters Field \u0026 Leaman. Before me was a wall of bulletproof glass that framed the double-door entrance to the reception area. The receptionist at the crescent-shaped desk saw the badge I held up to the glass. She hit the button that unlocked the doors as I put my ID away. \"Hi, Megumi,\" I greeted her when I stepped inside, admiring her cranberry-colored blouse. She was mixed race, a little bit Asian for sure, and very pretty. Her hair was dark and thick, and cut into a sleek bob that was shorter in the back and razor sharp in the front. Her sloe eyes were brown and warm, and her lips were full and naturally pink.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-4.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
