Cary Taylor found excuses to celebrate, no matter how small and inconsequential. I\u0027d always considered it part of his charm. \"I\u0027m sure drinking the night before starting a new job is a bad idea.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Eva.\" Cary sat on our new living room floor amid a half-dozen moving boxes and flashed his winning smile. We\u0027d been unpacking for days, yet he still looked amazing. Leanly built, dark-haired, and green-eyed, Cary was a man who rarely looked anything less than absolutely gorgeous on any day of his life. I might have resented that if he hadn\u0027t been the dearest person on earth to me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about a bender,\" he insisted. \"Just a glass of wine or two. We can hit a happy hour and be in by eight.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll make it back in time.\" I gestured at my yoga pants and fitted workout tank. \"After I time the walk to work, I\u0027m going to hit the gym.\"\\n\\n \"Walk fast, work out faster.\" Cary\u0027s perfectly executed arched brow made me laugh. I fully expected his million-dollar face to appear on billboards and fashion magazines all over the world one day. No matter his expression, he was a knockout.\\n\\n \"How about tomorrow after work?\" I offered as a substitute. \"If I make it through the day, that\u0027ll be worth celebrating.\"\\n\\n \"Deal. I\u0027m breaking in the new kitchen for dinner.\"\\n\\n \"Uh...\" Cooking was one of Cary\u0027s joys, but it wasn\u0027t one of his talents. \"Great.\"\\n\\n Blowing a wayward strand of hair off his face, he grinned at me. \"We\u0027ve got a kitchen most restaurants would kill for. There\u0027s no way to screw up a meal in there.\"\\n\\n Dubious, I headed out with a wave, choosing to avoid a conversation about cooking. Taking the elevator down to the first floor, I smiled at the doorman when he let me out to the street with a flourish.\\n\\n The moment I stepped outside, the smells and sounds of Manhattan embraced me and invited me to explore. I was not merely across the country from my former home in San Diego, but seemingly worlds away. Two major metropolises - one endlessly temperate and sensually lazy, the other teeming with life and frenetic energy. In my dreams, I\u0027d imagining living in a walkup in Brooklyn, but being a dutiful daughter, I found myself on the Upper West Side instead. If not for Cary living with me, I would\u0027ve been miserably lonely in the sprawling apartment that cost more per month than most people made in a year.\\n\\n The doorman tipped his hat to me. \"Good evening, Miss Tramell. Will you need a cab this evening?\"\\n\\n \"No thanks, Paul.\" I rocked onto the rounded heels of my fitness shoes. \"I\u0027ll be walking.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"It\u0027s cooled down from this afternoon. Should be nice.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been told I should enjoy the June weather before it gets wicked hot.\"\\n\\n \"Very good advice, Miss Tramell.\"\\n\\n Stepping out from under the modern glass entrance overhang that somehow meshed with the age of the building and its neighbors, I enjoyed the relative quiet of my tree-lined street before I reached the bustle and flow of traffic on Broadway. One day soon, I hoped to blend right in, but for now I still felt like a fraudulent New Yorker. I had the address and the job, but I was still wary of the subway and had trouble hailing cabs. I tried not to walk around wide-eyed and distracted, but it was hard. There was just so much to see and experience.\\n\\n The sensory input was astonishing - the smell of vehicle exhaust mixed with food from vendor carts, the shouts of hawkers blended with music from street entertainers, the awe-inspiring range of faces and styles and accents, the gorgeous architectural wonders...And the cars. Jesus Christ. The frenetic flow of tightly packed cars was unlike anything I\u0027d ever seen anywhere.\\n\\n There was always an ambulance, patrol car, or fire engine trying to part the flood of yellow taxis with the electronic wail of ear-splitting sirens. I was in awe of the lumbering garbage trucks that navigated tiny one-way streets and the package delivery drivers who braved the bumper-to-bumper traffic while facing rigid deadlines.\\n\\n Real New Yorkers cruised right through it all, their love for the city as comfortable and familiar as a favorite pair of shoes. They didn\u0027t view the steam billowing from potholes and vents in the sidewalks with romantic delight and they didn\u0027t blink an eye when the ground vibrated beneath their feet as the subway roared by below, while I grinned like an idiot and flexed my toes. New York was a brand new love affair for me. I was starry-eyed and it showed.\\n\\n So I had to really work at playing it cool as I made my way over to the building where I would be working. As far as my job went, at least, I\u0027d gotten my way. I wanted to make a living based on my own merits and that meant an entry-level position. Starting the next morning, I would be the assistant to Mark Garrity at Waters Field \u0026 Leaman, one of the preeminent advertising agencies in the US. My stepfather, mega-financier Richard Stanton, had been annoyed when I took the job, pointing out that if I\u0027d been less prideful I could\u0027ve worked for a friend of his instead and reaped the benefits of that connection.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re as stubborn as your father,\" he\u0027d said. \"It\u0027ll take him forever to pay off your student loans on a cop\u0027s salary.\"\\n\\n That had been a major fight, with my dad unwilling to back down. \"Hell if another man\u0027s gonna pay for my daughter\u0027s education,\" Victor Reyes had said when Stanton made the offer. I respected that. I suspected Stanton did, too, although he would never admit it. I understood both men\u0027s sides, because I\u0027d fought to pay off the loans myself...and lost. It was a point of pride for my father. My mother had refused to marry him, but he\u0027d never wavered from his determination to be my dad in every way possible. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-1.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
