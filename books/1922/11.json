But my gray eyes came from my dad. Taking a chair at the head of the table, Stanton was aware that the requisite backdrop of the New York skyline was behind him and he took advantage of its impressiveness. \"Eat,\" he said, with the command so easily wielded by all men of power. Men like Gideon Cross. Had Stanton been as driven at Cross\u0027s age? I picked up my fork and started in on a chicken, cranberry, walnut, and feta salad. It was delicious, and I was hungry. I was glad Stanton didn\u0027t start talking right away so I could enjoy the meal, but the reprieve didn\u0027t last long. \"Eva love, I wanted to discuss your interest in Krav Maga.\" I froze. \"Excuse me?\" Stanton took a sip of iced water and leaned back, his jaw taking on the rigidity that warned me I wouldn\u0027t like what he was about to say. \"Your mother was quite distraught last night when you went to that studio in Brooklyn. It took some time to calm her down and to assure her that I could make arrangements for you to pursue your interests in a safe manner. She doesn\u0027t want - \" \"Wait.\" I set my fork down carefully, my appetite gone. \"How did she know where I was?\" \"She tracked your cell phone.\" \"No way,\" I breathed, deflating into my seat. The casualness of his reply, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, made me feel ill. My stomach churned, suddenly more interested in rejecting my lunch than digesting it. \"That\u0027s why she insisted I use one of your company phones. It had nothing to do with saving me money.\" \"Of course that was part of it. But it also gives her peace of mind.\" \"Peace of mind? To spy on her grown daughter? It\u0027s not healthy, Richard. You\u0027ve got to see that. Is she still seeing Dr. Petersen?\" He had the grace to look uncomfortable. \"Yes, of course.\" \"Is she telling him what she\u0027s doing?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said stiffly. \"That\u0027s Monica\u0027s private business. I don\u0027t interfere.\" No, he didn\u0027t. He coddled her. Indulged her. Spoiled her. And allowed her obsession with my safety to run wild. \"She has to let it go. I\u0027ve let it go.\" \"You were an innocent, Eva. She feels guilty for not protecting you. We need to give her a little latitude.\" \"Latitude? She\u0027s a stalker!\" My mind spun. How could my mom invade my privacy like that? Why would she? She was driving herself crazy, and me along with her. \"This has to stop.\" \"It\u0027s an easy fix. I\u0027ve already spoken with Clancy. He\u0027ll drive you when you need to venture into Brooklyn. Everything\u0027s been arranged. This will be much more convenient for you.\" \"Don\u0027t try to twist this around to being for my benefit.\" My eyes stung and my throat burned with unshed tears of frustration. I hated the way he talked about Brooklyn like it was a third-world country. \"I\u0027m a grown woman. I make my own decisions. It\u0027s the goddamn law!\" \"Don\u0027t take that tone with me, Eva. I\u0027m simply looking after your mother. And you.\" I pushed back from the table. \"You\u0027re enabling her. You\u0027re keeping her sick, and you\u0027re making me sick, too.\" \"Sit down. You need to eat. Monica worries that you\u0027re not eating healthy enough.\" \"She worries about everything, Richard. That\u0027s the problem.\" I dropped my napkin on the table. \"I have to get back to work.\" I turned away, striding toward the door to get out as quickly as possible. I retrieved my purse from Stanton\u0027s secretary and left my cell phone on her desk. Clancy, who had been waiting for me in the reception area, followed me, and I knew better than to try and blow him off. He didn\u0027t take orders from anyone but Stanton. Clancy drove me back up to midtown, while I stewed in the backseat. I could bitch all I wanted, but in the end I wasn\u0027t any better than Stanton because I was going to give in. I was going to cave and let my mom have her way, because it hurt my heart to think of her suffering any more than she already did. She was so emotional and fragile, and she loved me to the point of being crazy about it. My mood was still dark when I got back to the Crossfire. As Clancy pulled away from the curb, I stood on the crowded sidewalk and looked up and down the busy street for either a drugstore where I could get some chocolate or a cellular store where I could pick up a new phone. I ended up walking around the block and buying a half-dozen candy bars at a Duane Reade on the corner before heading back to the Crossfire. I\u0027d been gone just about an hour, but I wasn\u0027t going to use the extra time Mark had given me. I needed work to distract me from my crazy-assed family. As I caught an empty elevator car, I ripped open a bar and bit viciously into it. I was making strides toward filling my self-imposed chocolate quota before I hit the twentieth floor when the car stopped on the fourth. I appreciated the added time the stop gave me to enjoy the comfort of dark chocolate and caramel melting over my tongue. The doors slid apart, and revealed Gideon Cross talking with two other gentlemen. As usual, I lost my breath at the sight of him, which reignited my fading irritation. Why did he have that effect on me? When was I going to become immune to his hotness? He glanced over and his lips curved into a slow, heart-stopping smile when he saw me. Great. Just my crappy luck. I\u0027d become some kind of challenge. Cross\u0027s smile faded into a frown. \"We\u0027ll finish this later,\" he murmured to his companions without looking away from me. Stepping into the car, he lifted a hand to discourage them from following him. They blinked in surprise, glancing at me, then Cross, and then back again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-11.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
