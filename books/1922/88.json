Talks you back around and makes you come at it from a different angle that has you thinking, \u0027Now why didn\u0027t I see it like that?\u0027\" Gideon\u0027s fingers stroked up and down the stem of his glass. \"He prescribed something for me to take at night before bed. I filled it before I came over.\" \"How do you feel about taking drugs?\" He looked at me with dark, haunted eyes. \"I feel it\u0027s necessary. I have to be with you and I have to make that safe for you, whatever it takes. Dr. Petersen says the drug combined with therapy has been successful for other \u0027atypical sexual parasomniacs.\u0027 I have to believe that.\" I reached over to squeeze his hand. Taking medication was a big step, especially for someone who\u0027d avoided facing his problems for a long time. \"Thank you.\" Gideon\u0027s grip tightened. \"Apparently there are enough people with this problem that there have been sleep studies on it. He told me about a documented case where a man sexually assaulted his wife in his sleep for twelve years before they sought help.\" \"Twelve years? Jesus.\" \"Apparently part of the reason they waited so long was because the man was a better lay when he was asleep,\" he said dryly. \"And if that\u0027s not a killer blow to the ego, I don\u0027t know what is.\" I stared at him. \"Well, shit.\" \"I know, right?\" His wry smile faded. \"But I don\u0027t want you to feel pressured to share a bed with me, Eva. There is no magic pill. I can sleep on the couch or I can go home, although of the two choices I\u0027d prefer the couch. My whole day is better after getting ready for work with you.\" \"For me, too.\" Reaching over, Gideon caught my hand and lifted it to his lips. \"I never imagined I could have this...Someone in my life who knows what you do about me. Someone who could talk about my f**k-ups over dinner because they accept me anyway...I\u0027m grateful for you, Eva.\" My heart twisted with a sweet pain in my chest. He could say such beautiful things, the perfect things. \"I feel the same way about you, ace.\" Deeper, maybe, because I loved him. But I didn\u0027t say that aloud. He\u0027d get there someday. I wasn\u0027t going to give up until he was absolutely, irrevocably mine. With his bare feet propped on the coffee table and his computer on his lap, Gideon looked so at home and relaxed that he kept distracting me from my television shows. How did we get here? I asked myself. This extravagantly sexy man and me? \"You\u0027re staring,\" he murmured, his gaze on his laptop screen. I stuck my tongue out at him. \"Is that a sexual suggestion, Miss Tramell?\" \"How do you see me while staring at whatever you\u0027re working on?\" He looked up then and caught my gaze. His blue eyes blazed with power and heat. \"I\u0027ve always seen you, angel. From the moment you found me, I\u0027ve seen nothing but you.\" Wednesday started with Gideon\u0027s c**k pushing into me from behind, my new favorite way to wake up. \"Well, then,\" I said hoarsely, rubbing the sleep from my eyes as his arm hitched around my waist and hauled me closer to his warm, hard chest. \"You\u0027re frisky this morning.\" \"You\u0027re gorgeous and sexy every morning,\" he murmured, nibbling on my shoulder. \"I love waking up to you.\" We celebrated a night of uninterrupted sleep with a handful of orgasms between us. Much later in the day, I had lunch with Mark and his partner Steven at a lovely Mexican restaurant tucked beneath the street. We descended a short set of cement stairs into a surprisingly spacious restaurant with black-vested waitstaff and plenty of light. \"You\u0027ll need to bring your man back here,\" Steven said, \"and have him buy you one of the pomegranate margaritas.\" \"Good stuff?\" I asked. \"Oh, yeah.\" When the waitress came to take our orders, she flirted outrageously with Mark, fluttering enviously long lashes. Mark flirted back. As the meal progressed, the exuberant redhead - whose name tag introduced her as Shawna - became bolder, touching Mark\u0027s shoulders and the back of his neck every time she came by. In return, Mark\u0027s banter became more suggestive, until I eyed Steven nervously, watching his face redden and his scowl deepen by the moment. Shifting uncomfortably, I was counting down the minutes until the tension-fraught meal was over. \"Let\u0027s get together tonight,\" Shawna said to Mark when she brought the check. \"One night with me and I\u0027ll cure you.\" I gaped. Seriously? \"Seven o\u0027clock work for you?\" Mark purred. \"I\u0027ll ruin you, Shawna. You know what happens once you go black...\" I inhaled my water down the wrong pipe and choked. Steven leaped to his feet and rounded the table, pounding me on the back. \"Hell, Eva,\" he said, laughing. \"We\u0027re just playing with you. Don\u0027t die on us.\" \"What?\" I gasped, my eyes watering. Grinning, he came around my shoulder and tossed his arm around the waitress. \"Eva, meet my sister, Shawna. Shawna, Eva here is the one who makes Mark\u0027s life easier.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" Shawna said, \"since he\u0027s got you to make things harder.\" Steven winked at me. \"That\u0027s why he keeps me around.\" Seeing the brother and sister pair so close together, I finally caught the resemblance I\u0027d missed before. I sagged into my seat and narrowed my eyes at Mark. \"That was rotten. I thought Steven was going to blow a gasket.\" Mark held up his hands in a show of surrender. \"It was all his idea. He\u0027s the drama queen, remember?\" Rocking back on his heels, Steven grinned and said, \"Now, Eva. You know Mark\u0027s the idea man in this relationship.\" Shawna dug a business card out of her pocket and handed it to me. \"My number\u0027s on the flipside. Gimme a call. I\u0027ve got the inside dirt on these two. You can pay \u0027em back really good.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-88.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
