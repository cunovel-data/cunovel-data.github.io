Gideon must have felt the same way, because I found Scott waiting for me at reception when I reached the Cross Industries waiting area. He walked me back after the receptionist buzzed me in.\n \"How\u0027s your day been?\" I asked him.\n He smiled. \"Great so far. Yours?\"\n I smiled back. \"I\u0027ve had worse.\"\n Gideon was on the phone when I entered his office. His tone was clipped and impatient as he told the person on the other end of the line that they should be able to manage the job without him having to oversee it personally.\n He held up one finger to me to tell me he\u0027d be another minute. I responded by blowing a big bubble with the gum I was chewing and popping it loudly.\n His brows shot up, and he hit the buttons to close the doors and frost the glass wall.\n Grinning, I sauntered over to his desk and hopped onto it, curling my fingers around the lip and swinging my legs. He popped the next bubble I blew with a quick jab of his finger. I pouted prettily.\n \"Deal with it,\" he said with quiet authority to whoever was on the phone. \"It\u0027ll be next week before I can get out there and waiting will set us back further. Stop talking. I have something time-sensitive on my desk and you\u0027re keeping me away from it. I guarantee that\u0027s not improving my disposition. Fix what needs fixing and report back to me tomorrow.\"\n He returned the phone to its cradle with suppressed violence. \"Eva - \"\n I held up one hand to cut him off and wrapped my gum in a Post-it I took from a dispenser on his desk. \"Before you reprimand me, Mr. Cross, I want to say that when we reached an impasse in our merger discussions at the hotel yesterday I shouldn\u0027t have walked out. It didn\u0027t help to resolve the situation. And I know I didn\u0027t react very well to the PR issue with the photo. But still...Even though I\u0027ve been a naughty secretary, I think I should be given another chance to excel.\"\n His gaze narrowed as he studied me, assessing and reevaluating the situation on the fly. \"Did I ask for your opinion on the appropriate action to take, Miss Tramell?\"\n I shook my head and looked up at him from beneath my lashes. I could see the lingering frustration from his phone call falling away from him, replaced by his growing interest and arousal.\n Hopping down from the desk, I sidled closer and smoothed his immaculate tie with both hands. \"Can\u0027t we work something out? I do possess a wide variety of useful skills.\"\n He caught me by the hips. \"Which is one of the many reasons you\u0027re the only woman I\u0027ve ever considered for the position.\"\n Warmth flowed through me at his words. Boldly cupping his c**k in my hand, I fondled him through his slacks. \"Maybe I should reapply myself to my duties? I could demonstrate some of the ways I\u0027m uniquely qualified to assist you.\"\n Gideon hardened with delectable swiftness. \"Such initiative, Miss Tramell. But my next meeting is less than ten minutes away. Also, I\u0027m not accustomed to exploring job enrichment opportunities in my office.\"\n I freed the button of his fly and lowered his zipper. With my lips to his jaw, I whispered, \"If you think there\u0027s anywhere I won\u0027t make you come, you\u0027ll have to revisit and revise.\"\n \"Eva,\" he breathed, his eyes hot and tender. He cupped my throat, his thumbs brushing over my jaw. \"You\u0027re unraveling me. Do you know that? Are you doing it on purpose?\"\n I reached inside his boxer briefs and wrapped my hands around him, offering up my lips for a kiss. He obliged me, taking my mouth with a fierceness that left me breathless.\n \"I want you,\" he growled.\n I sank to my knees on the carpeted floor, pulling his pants down enough to give me the access I needed.\n He exhaled harshly. \"Eva, what are you - \"\n My lips flowed over the wide crown. He reached back for the edge of his desk, his hands curling around the lip with white-knuckled force. I held him with both hands and mouthed the plush head, sucking gently. The softness of his skin and his uniquely appealing scent made me moan. I felt the vibration ripple through his entire body and heard a rough sound rumble in his chest.\n Gideon touched my cheek. \"Lick it.\"\n Aroused by the command, I fluttered my tongue across the underside and shivered with delight when he rewarded me with a hot burst of pr**cum. Fisting the root of him with one hand, I hollowed my cheeks and drew rhythmically, hoping for more.\n I wished I had the time to make it last. Drive him crazy...\n He made a sound filled with the sweetest agony. \"God, Eva...your mouth. Keep sucking. Like that...hard and deep.\"\n I was so turned on by his pleasure I squirmed. His hands pushed into my bound hair, pulling and tugging at the roots. I loved how he started out with tenderness, then grew rougher as the lust he felt for me overwhelmed his control.\n The soft bite of pain made me hungrier, greedier. My head bobbed as I pleasured him, jacking him with one hand while I sucked and stroked the crest with my mouth. Heavy veins coursed the length of his cock, and I slid the flat of my tongue along them, tilting my head to find and caress each one.\n He swelled, growing thicker and longer. My knees were uncomfortable, but I didn\u0027t care; my gaze was riveted to Gideon as his head fell back and he fought for breath.\n \"Eva, you suck me so good.\" He held my head still and took over. Thrusting his hips. Fucking my mouth. Stripped to a level of base need where only the race to orgasm mattered.\n The thought made me crazed, the image in my mind of how we must look: Gideon in all his urbane sophistication, standing at the desk where he ruled an empire, stroking his big c**k in and out of my greedy mouth. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-47.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
