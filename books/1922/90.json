I could play the role of a bubbleheaded blond bimbo who\u0027s after your c**k and your millions, and you can be yourself - the billionaire playboy with his latest toy. Just look bored and indulgent while I rub up against you and coo about how brilliant you are.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not funny.\" Then he brightened. \"What about a scarf?\"\\n\\n Once we checked in for the gala dinner benefitting a new crisis shelter for women and children, we were directed to a press gauntlet, triggering my fear of exposure. I focused on Gideon because nothing distracted me as thoroughly as he did. And because I was paying such close attention, I was able to watch the change from private man to public persona as it happened.\\n\\n The mask slipped smoothly into place. His irises chilled to an icy blue and his sensual mouth lost any hint of curve. I could almost feel the force of his will enclosing us. There was a shield between us and the rest of the world simply because he wished it to be there. Standing beside him, I knew no one would approach or speak to me until he gave them some sign that they could.\\n\\n Still, the don\u0027t-touch vibe didn\u0027t extend to looking. Gideon turned heads as we walked to the ballroom and eyes followed him. I got a nervous twitch from all the attention he garnered, but he seemed oblivious and completely unruffled.\\n\\n If I\u0027d had my heart set on cooing and rubbing all over Gideon, I would\u0027ve had to wait in line. He was pretty much mobbed the moment we stopped walking. I stepped away to make room for those vying to catch his attention and wandered off to find some champagne. Waters Field \u0026 Leaman had done the pro bono advertising for the gala, and I spotted a few people I knew.\\n\\n I\u0027d managed to snag a glass off a passing waiter\u0027s tray when I heard someone call out my name. Turning, I saw Stanton\u0027s nephew approaching with a broad smile. Dark-haired and green-eyed, he was around my age. I knew him from the times I\u0027d visited my mother on holiday breaks and was glad to see him.\\n\\n \"Martin!\" I greeted him with open arms and we hugged briefly. \"How are you? You look fabulous.\"\\n\\n \"I was about to say the same.\" He eyed my dress appreciatively. \"I\u0027d heard you\u0027d moved to New York and meant to look you up. How long have you been in town?\"\\n\\n \"Not long. A few weeks.\"\\n\\n \"Drink your champagne,\" he said. \"And let\u0027s dance.\"\\n\\n The wine was still bubbling nicely through my system when we moved onto the dance floor to the sound of Billie Holliday singing \"Summertime.\"\\n\\n \"So,\" he began, \"are you working?\"\\n\\n As we danced, I told him about my job and I asked what he was up to. I wasn\u0027t surprised to hear he was working for Stanton\u0027s investment firm and doing well.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d love to come uptown and take you out to lunch sometime,\" he said.\\n\\n \"That would be great.\" I stepped back as the music ended and bumped into someone behind me. Hands went to my waist to steady me and I looked over my shoulder to find Gideon at my back.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" he purred, his icy gaze on Martin. \"Introduce us.\"\\n\\n \"Gideon, this is Martin Stanton. We\u0027ve known each other for a few years now. He\u0027s my stepfather\u0027s nephew.\" I took a deep breath and went for it. \"Martin, this is the significant man in my life, Gideon Cross.\"\\n\\n \"Cross.\" Martin grinned and held out his hand. \"I know who you are, of course. It\u0027s a pleasure to meet you. If things work out, maybe I\u0027ll be seeing you at some of the family gatherings.\"\\n\\n Gideon\u0027s arm slid around my shoulders. \"Count on it.\"\\n\\n Martin was hailed by someone he knew and he leaned forward to kiss my cheek. \"I\u0027ll call you about lunch. Next week maybe?\"\\n\\n \"Great.\" I was highly conscious of Gideon vibrating with energy beside me, although when I glanced at him, his face with calm and impassive.\\n\\n He pulled me into a dance, with Louis Armstrong singing \"What a Wonderful World.\" \"Not sure I like him,\" he muttered.\\n\\n \"Martin\u0027s a very nice guy.\"\\n\\n \"Just so long as he knows you\u0027re mine.\" He pressed his cheek to my temple and placed his hand within the cutout back of my dress, skin to skin. There was no way to doubt that I belonged to him when he was holding me like that.\\n\\n I relished the opportunity to be so close to his scrumptious body in public. Breathing him in, I relaxed into his expert hold. \"I like this.\"\\n\\n Nuzzling against me, he murmured, \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\\n\\n Bliss. It lasted as long as the dance did.\\n\\n We were exiting the dance floor when I caught sight of Magdalene off to the side. It took me a moment to recognize her because she\u0027d cut her hair into a sleek bob. She looked slender and classy in a simple black cocktail dress, but was eclipsed by the striking brunette she was speaking to.\\n\\n Gideon\u0027s stride faltered, slowing fractionally before resuming his usual pace. I was looking down, thinking he\u0027d avoided something on the floor, when he said quietly, \"I need to introduce you to someone.\"\\n\\n My attention shifted to see where we were going. The woman with Magdalene had spotted Gideon and turned to face him. I felt his forearm tense beneath my fingers the moment their gazes met.\\n\\n I could see why.\\n\\n The woman, whoever she was, was deeply in love with Gideon. It was there on her face and in her pale, otherworldly blue eyes. Her beauty was stunning, so exquisite as to be surreal. Her hair was black as ink and hung thick and straight almost to her waist. Her dress was the same icy hue as her eyes, her skin golden from the sun, her body long and perfectly curved.\\n\\n \"Corinne,\" he greeted her, the natural rasp in his voice even more pronounced. He released me and caught her hands. \"You didn\u0027t tell me you were back. I would\u0027ve picked you up.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-90.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
