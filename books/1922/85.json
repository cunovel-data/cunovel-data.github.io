I dove for it with hands and mouth, ignoring his vicious curse. Pinning his torso with my forearm, I pumped him hard with my other fist and sucked voraciously on the sensitive crown. His thighs quivered, his legs kicking restlessly. \"Damn it, Eva. Fuck.\" He stiffened and gasped, his hands shoving into my hair, his h*ps bucking. \"Oh, f**k. Suck it hard...Ah, Christ...\" He exploded in a powerful rush that almost choked me, coming hard, flooding my mouth. I took it all, my fist milking pulse after pulse up the throbbing length of his cock, swallowing repeatedly until he shuddered with the surfeit of sensation and begged me to stop. I straightened and Gideon sat up and wrapped himself around me. He took me back down to the floor where he buried his face in my throat and cried until dawn. I wore a black long-sleeved silk blouse and slacks to work on Tuesday, feeling the need to have a barrier between myself and the world. In the kitchen, Gideon cupped my face in his hands and brushed his mouth across mine with heartrending tenderness. His gaze remained haunted. \"Lunch?\" I asked, feeling like we needed to cling to the connection between us. \"I have a business lunch.\" He ran his fingers through my loose hair. \"Would you come? I\u0027ll make sure Angus gets you back to work on time.\" \"I\u0027d love to come along.\" I thought of the schedule of evening events, meetings, and appointments he\u0027d sent to my smartphone. \"And tomorrow night we have a benefit dinner at the Waldorf\u003dAstoria?\" His gaze softened. Dressed for work, he looked somber yet collected. I knew he was anything but. \"You really won\u0027t give up on me, will you?\" he asked quietly. I held up my right hand and showed him my ring. \"You\u0027re stuck with me, Cross. Get used to it.\" On the drive to work, he cuddled me in his lap, and again on the ride to lunch at Jean Georges. I didn\u0027t speak more than a dozen words during the meal, which Gideon ordered for me and I enjoyed immensely. I sat quietly at his side, my left hand resting on his hard thigh beneath the tablecloth, a wordless affirmation of my commitment to him. To us. One of his hands rested over mine, warm and strong, as he discussed a new property in development on St. Croix. We kept that connection throughout the entire meal, each of us choosing to eat one-handed rather than separate. With each hour that passed, I felt the horror of the night before drain away from both of us. It would be another scar to add to his collection, another bitter memory he\u0027d always have, a memory I would share and fear along with him, but it wouldn\u0027t rule us. We wouldn\u0027t let it. Angus was waiting to take me home when my day ended. Gideon was working late, and then going directly from the Crossfire to Dr. Petersen\u0027s office. I used the length of the drive to steel myself for the next round of training with Parker. I debated skipping it, but ended up deciding it was important to keep to a routine. So much in my life was uncontrollable at the moment. Following a schedule was one of the few things totally within my power. After an hour and a half of tagging and groundwork with Parker at the studio, I was relieved when Clancy dropped me off at home and proud of myself for working out when it was the last thing I\u0027d wanted to do. When I stepped into the lobby, I found Trey talking to the front desk. \"Hey,\" I greeted him. \"Going up?\" He turned to face me, his brown eyes warm and his smile open. Trey had a gentleness to him, a kind of straightforward naivete that was different from the other relationships Cary\u0027d had before. Or maybe I should just say Trey was \"normal,\" which so few of the people in my and Cary\u0027s lives were. \"Cary\u0027s not in,\" he said. \"They just tried calling.\" \"You\u0027re welcome to come up with me and wait. I won\u0027t be going out again.\" \"If you really don\u0027t mind.\" He fell into step beside me as I waved at the gal at the front desk and moved toward the elevators. \"I brought something for him.\" \"I don\u0027t mind at all,\" I assured him, returning his sweet smile. He eyed my yoga pants and tank top. \"You just get back from the gym?\" \"Yeah. Despite it being one of those days when I\u0027d rather have done anything else.\" He laughed as we stepped into the elevator. \"I know that feeling.\" As we rode up, silence descended. It was weighted. \"Everything all right?\" I asked him. \"Well...\" Trey adjusted the sling of his backpack. \"Cary\u0027s just seemed a little off the last few days.\" \"Oh?\" I bit my lower lip. \"In what way?\" \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s hard to explain. I just feel like maybe something\u0027s up with him and I\u0027m missing what it is.\" I thought of the blonde and winced inwardly. \"Maybe he\u0027s stressed about the Grey Isles job and he doesn\u0027t want to bother you with it. He knows you\u0027ve got your hands full with your job and school.\" The tension in his shoulders softened. \"Maybe that\u0027s it. It makes sense. Okay. Thank you.\" I let us in to the apartment and told him to make himself at home. Trey headed to Cary\u0027s room to drop his stuff, while I went to the phone to check the voice mail. A shout from down the hallway had me reaching for the phone for a different reason, my heart thudding with thoughts of intruders and imminent danger. More yelling followed, with one voice clearly belonging to Cary. I exhaled in a rush, relieved. With the phone in my hand, I ventured to see what the hell was going on. I was nearly run over by Tatiana rounding the hallway corner still buttoning her blouse.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-85.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
