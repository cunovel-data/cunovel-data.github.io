{"id":63243,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"Okay.\" Cary ran his hand down my arm. \"I\u0027ll get your shawl from the coatroom and see you out front.\"\n It took longer to get to the restroom than it should have. For one, a surprising number of people stopped me for small talk, which had to be because I was Gideon Cross\u0027s date. And two, I avoided the nearest ladies\u0027 room, which had a steady flow of women pouring in and out of it, and I found one located farther away. I locked myself in a stall and took a few moments longer to finish my business than absolutely required. There was no one else in the room besides the attendant, so there was no one to rush me.\n I was so hurt by Gideon it was hard to breathe and I was so confused by his mood swings. Why had he touched my face like that? Why had he gotten mad when I didn\u0027t stay by his side? And why the hell had he threatened Cary? Gideon gave new meaning to the old adage about \"running hot and cold.\"\n Closing my eyes, I shored up my composure. Jesus. I didn\u0027t need this.\n I\u0027d bared my emotions in the limo and I still felt horribly vulnerable - a state I\u0027d spent countless therapy hours learning to avoid. I wanted nothing more than to be home and hidden, freed from the pressure of acting like I was completely pulled together when I was anything but.\n You set yourself up for this, I reminded myself. Suck it up.\n Taking a deep breath, I stepped out and was resigned to finding Magdalene leaning against the vanity with her arms crossed. She was clearly there for me, lying in wait at a time when my defenses were already weak. My step faltered; then I recovered and made my way to the sink to wash my hands.\n She turned to face the mirror, studying my reflection. I studied her, too. She was even more gorgeous in person than she\u0027d been in her photos. Tall and slender, with big dark eyes and a cascade of straight brown hair. Her lips were lush and red, her cheekbones high and sculpted. Her dress was modestly sexy, a flowing sheath of creamy satin that contrasted beautifully with her olive skin. She looked like a f**king supermodel and exuded an exotic sex appeal.\n I accepted the hand towel the bathroom attendant handed me, and Magdalene spoke to the woman in Spanish, asking her to give us some privacy. I capped the request with, \"Por favor, gracias.\" That earned me an arched brow from Magdalene and a closer examination, which I returned with equal coolness.\n \"Oh, dear,\" she murmured, the moment the attendant stepped out of earshot. She made a tsking noise that scraped over my nerves like nails on a chalkboard. \"You\u0027ve f**ked him already.\"\n \"And you haven\u0027t.\"\n That seemed to surprise her. \"You\u0027re right, I haven\u0027t. You know why?\"\n I pulled a five-spot out of my clutch and dropped it in the silver tip tray. \"Because he doesn\u0027t want to.\"\n \"And I don\u0027t want to either, because he can\u0027t commit. He\u0027s young, gorgeous, rich, and he\u0027s enjoying it.\"\n \"Yes.\" I nodded. \"He certainly did.\"\n Her gaze narrowed, her pleasant expression slipping slightly. \"He doesn\u0027t respect the women he f**ks. The minute he shoved his dick in you, you were done. Just like all the others. But I\u0027m still here, because I\u0027m the one he wants to keep around for the long haul.\"\n I maintained my cool even though the blow had been a perfect hit right where the most damage could be done. \"That\u0027s pathetic.\"\n I walked out and didn\u0027t stop until I reached Stanton\u0027s limousine. Squeezing Cary\u0027s hand as I got in, I managed to wait until the car pulled away from the curb to start crying.\n \"Hey, baby girl,\" Cary called out when I shuffled into the living room the next morning. Dressed in nothing but a loose pair of old sweats, he was stretched out on the couch with his feet crossed and propped on the coffee table. He looked beautifully disheveled and comfortable in his own skin. \"How\u0027d you sleep?\"\n I gave him the thumbs-up and headed into the kitchen for coffee. I paused by the breakfast bar, my brows lifting at the massive arrangement of red roses on the counter. The fragrance was divine and I inhaled it with a deep breath. \"What\u0027s this?\"\n \"They came for you about an hour ago. A Sunday delivery. Pretty and super pricey.\"\n I plucked the card off the clear plastic stake and opened it.\n I\u0027m still thinking about you.\n Gideon\n \"From Cross?\" Cary asked.\n \"Yes.\" My thumb brushed over what I assumed was his handwriting. It was bold and masculine and sexy. A romantic gesture for a guy who didn\u0027t have romance in his repertoire. I dropped the card on the counter as if it\u0027d burned me and fetched a mug of coffee, praying caffeine would give me strength and restore my common sense.\n \"You don\u0027t seem impressed.\" He lowered the volume on the football game he was watching.\n \"He\u0027s bad news for me. He\u0027s like one giant trigger. I just need to stay away from him.\" Cary had been through therapy with me and he knew the drill. He didn\u0027t look at me funny when I broke things down into therapeutic jargon, and he didn\u0027t have any trouble shooting it back to me the same way.\n \"The phone\u0027s been ringing all morning, too. I didn\u0027t want it to disturb you, so I shut the volume off.\"\n Aware of the lingering ache between my legs, I curled up on the couch and fought the compulsion to listen to our voice mail to see if Gideon had called. I wanted to hear his voice, and an explanation that would make sense of what happened last night. \"Sounds good to me. Let\u0027s leave it off all day.\"\n \"What happened?\"\n I blew steam off the top of my mug and took a tentative sip. \"I f**ked his brains out in his limo and he turned arctic afterward.\"\n Cary watched me with those worldly emerald eyes, eyes that had seen more than anyone should be subjected to. \"Rocked his world, did you?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-31.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
