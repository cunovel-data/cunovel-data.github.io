When he cupped them, I splayed my hands on his shoulders and rocked my hips. He was semi-hard, yet quickly thickened as I began to undulate. His fingers on my ni**les, rolling and tugging, sent waves of pleasure through me, the gentle stimulation arrowing to my core. When he urged me closer and took a hardened tip in his mouth I cried out, my body igniting with need for more. Clenching my thighs, I lifted. I closed my eyes to focus on the way he felt as he slid out; then bit my lip at the way he stretched me sliding back in. \"That\u0027s it,\" he murmured, licking across my chest to my other nipple, fluttering his tongue over the tight, aching tip. \"Come for me. I need you to come riding my cock.\" Rolling my hips, I relished the exquisite feel of him filling me so perfectly. I had no shame, no regrets as I worked myself into a frenzy on his stiff penis, adjusting the angle so that the thick crown rubbed right where I needed it. \"Gideon,\" I breathed. \"Oh, yes...oh please...\" \"You\u0027re so beautiful.\" He gripped the back of my neck in one hand and my waist in the other, arching his h*ps to push a little deeper. \"So sexy. I\u0027m going to come for you again. That\u0027s what you do to me, Eva. It\u0027s never enough.\" I whimpered as everything tightened, as the sweet tension built from the deep rhythmic strokes. I was panting and frantic, pumping my hips. Reaching between my legs, I rubbed my cl*t with the pads of my fingers, hastening my cl**ax. He gasped, his head thrown back into the sofa cushion, his neck corded with strain. \"I feel you getting ready to come. Your cunt gets so hot and tight, so greedy.\" His words and his voice pushed me over. I cried out when the first hard tremor hit me; then again as the orgasm rippled through my body, my sex spasming around Gideon\u0027s steely erection. Teeth grinding audibly, he held on until the clenches began to fade; then he clutched my h*ps aloft and pumped upward into me. Once, twice. On the third deep thrust, he growled my name and spurted hotly, laying the last of my fears and doubts to rest. I don\u0027t know how long we sprawled on the couch like that, connected and close, my head on his shoulder and his hands caressing the curve of my spine. Gideon pressed his lips to my temple and murmured, \"Stay.\" \"Yes.\" He hugged me. \"You\u0027re so brave, Eva. So strong and honest. You\u0027re a miracle. My miracle.\" \"A miracle of modern therapy, maybe,\" I scoffed, my fingers playing in his luxuriant hair. \"And even with that, I was really f**ked up for a while and there are still some triggers I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get past.\" \"God. The way I came on to you in the beginning...I could\u0027ve ruined us before we even got started. And the advocacy dinner - \" He shuddered and buried his face in my neck. \"Eva, don\u0027t let me blow this. Don\u0027t let me chase you away.\" Lifting my head, I searched his face. He was impossibly gorgeous. I had trouble taking it in at times. \"You can\u0027t second-guess everything you do or say to me because of Nathan and what he did. It\u0027ll break us apart. It\u0027ll end us.\" \"Don\u0027t say that. Don\u0027t even think about it.\" I smoothed his knit brow with strokes of my thumb. \"I wish I could\u0027ve never told you. I wish you didn\u0027t have to know.\" He caught my hand and pressed my fingertips to his lips. \"I have to know everything, every part of you, inside and out, every detail.\" \"A woman has to have some secrets,\" I teased. \"You won\u0027t have any with me.\" He captured me by my hair and an arm banded around my hips, urging me against him, reminding me - as if I could forget - that he was still inside me. \"I\u0027m going to possess you, Eva. It\u0027s only fair since you\u0027ve possessed me.\" \"And what about your secrets, Gideon?\" His face smoothed into an emotionless mask, an act so easily accomplished I knew it had become second nature to him. \"I started from scratch when I met you. Everything I thought I was, everything I thought I needed...\" He shook his head. \"We\u0027re figuring out who I am together. You\u0027re the only one who knows me.\" But I didn\u0027t. Not really. I was figuring him out, learning him bit by bit, but he was still a mystery to me in so many ways. \"Eva...If you just tell me what you want - \" His throat worked on a swallow. \"I can get better at this, if you give me the chance. Just don\u0027t...don\u0027t give up on me.\" Jesus. He could shred me so easily. A few words, a desperate look, and I was cut wide open. I touched his face, his hair, his shoulders. He was as broken as I was, in a way I didn\u0027t yet know about. \"I need something from you, Gideon.\" \"Anything. Just tell me what it is.\" \"Every day, I need you to tell me something I don\u0027t know about you. Something insightful, no matter how small. I need you to promise me that you will.\" Gideon eyed me warily. \"Whatever I want?\" I nodded, unsure of myself and what I hoped to get out of him. He exhaled harshly. \"Okay.\" I kissed him softly, a silent show of thanks. Nuzzling his nose against mine, he asked, \"Let\u0027s go out to dinner. Or do you want to order in?\" \"Are you sure we should go out?\" \"I want to go on a date with you.\" There was no way I could say no to that, not when I knew what a big step it was for him. A big step for both of us, really, since the last time we\u0027d gone on a date it\u0027d ended in disaster. \"Sounds romantic. And irresistible.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-55.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
