{"id":63298,"no":86,"title":"Page 86","content":"\"Oops,\" she said, with an unapologetic grin. \"See ya.\"\n I couldn\u0027t hear the door shut behind her over Trey\u0027s shouting.\n \"Fuck you, Cary. We talked about this! You promised!\"\n \"You\u0027re blowing this out of proportion,\" Cary barked. \"It\u0027s not what you think.\"\n Trey came storming out of Cary\u0027s bedroom in such a rush that I plastered myself to the hallway wall to get out of his way. Cary followed, with a sheet slung around his waist. As he passed me, I shot him a narrow-eyed glance that earned me a f**k-off middle finger.\n I left the two men alone and escaped into my shower, angry at Cary for once again ruining something good in his life. It was a pattern I kept hoping he\u0027d break, but he couldn\u0027t seem to kick it.\n When I came out to the kitchen a half hour later, the stillness in the apartment was absolute. I focused on cooking dinner, deciding to go with a pork roast and new potatoes with asparagus, one of Cary\u0027s favorite dinners, in case he was home for dinner and needed some cheering up.\n The sight of Trey stepping into the hallway while I was putting the roast in the oven surprised me, and then it made me sad. I hated to see him leave looking flushed, disheveled, and crying. My pity turned to fierce disappointment when Cary joined me in the kitchen with the scent of male sweat and sex clinging to him. He shot me a scowl as he passed me on his way to the wine fridge.\n I faced him with my arms crossed. \"Screwing a heartbroken lover on the same sheets he\u0027s just caught you cheating on isn\u0027t going to make things better.\"\n \"Shut up, Eva.\"\n \"He\u0027s probably hating himself right now for giving in.\"\n \"I said shut the f**k up.\"\n \"Fine.\" I turned away from him and focused on seasoning the potatoes to put in the oven with the roast.\n Cary grabbed wineglasses out of the cupboard. \"I can feel you judging me. Stop it. He wouldn\u0027t be half as pissed if it\u0027d been a man he caught me f**king.\"\n \"It\u0027s all his fault, huh?\"\n \"Newsflash: Your love life isn\u0027t perfect either.\"\n \"Low blow, Cary. I\u0027m not going to be your punching bag over this. You messed up, and then you made it worse. It\u0027s all on you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t get on your damn high horse. You\u0027re sleeping with a man who\u0027s going to rape you any day now.\"\n \"It\u0027s not like that!\"\n He snorted and leaned his hip against the counter, his green eyes filled with pain and anger. \"If you\u0027re going to make excuses for him because he\u0027s sleeping when he attacks you, you\u0027ll have to make those same excuses for drunks and druggies. They don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing either.\"\n The truth of his words struck me hard, as did the fact that he was deliberately trying to wound me. \"You can put down a bottle. You can\u0027t quit sleeping.\"\n Straightening, Cary opened the bottle he\u0027d selected and poured two glasses, sliding one across the counter toward me. \"If anyone knows what it\u0027s like to be involved with people who hurt you, it\u0027s me. You love him. You want to save him. But who\u0027s going to save you, Eva? I\u0027m not always going to be around when you\u0027re with him and he\u0027s a ticking time bomb.\"\n \"You wanna talk about being in relationships that hurt, Cary?\" I shot back, deflecting him away from my painful truths. \"Did you screw Trey over to protect yourself? Did you figure you\u0027d push him away before he had the chance to disappoint you?\"\n Cary\u0027s mouth curved bitterly. He tapped his glass to mine, which still sat on the counter. \"Cheers to us, the seriously f**ked up. At least we have each other.\"\n He stalked out of the room and I deflated. I\u0027d known this was coming - the unraveling of circumstances too good to be true. Contentment and happiness didn\u0027t exist in my life for more than a few moments at a time, and they were really only illusionary.\n There was always something hidden. Lying in wait to spring up and ruin everything.\n Chapter 20\n Gideon arrived just as dinner was coming out of the oven. He had a garment bag in one hand and a laptop case in the other. I\u0027d worried that he would try to go home alone after his session with Dr. Petersen and was relieved when he\u0027d called to say he was on his way. Still, when I first opened the door and saw him on the threshold, a shiver of unease slid through me.\n \"Hey,\" he said quietly, following me back into the kitchen. \"Smells delicious in here.\"\n \"I hope you\u0027re hungry. There\u0027s a lot of food and I\u0027ll be surprised if Cary joins us to help eat it all.\"\n Gideon dropped his stuff on the breakfast bar and approached me cautiously, his gaze searching my face as he neared. \"I brought some things with me to stay the night, but I\u0027ll go if you want. At any time. Just tell me.\"\n I blew out my breath in a harsh rush, determined not to let fear dictate my actions. \"I want you here.\"\n \"I want to be here.\" He paused beside me. \"Can I hold you?\"\n I turned into him and squeezed him hard. \"Please.\"\n He pressed his cheek against mine and hugged me close. The embrace wasn\u0027t as natural and easy as we\u0027d grown used to. There was a new wariness between us that was different from anything we\u0027d felt before.\n \"How are you doing?\" he murmured.\n \"Better now that you\u0027re here.\"\n \"But still nervous.\" He pressed his lips to my forehead. \"Me, too. I don\u0027t know how we\u0027re ever going to fall asleep next to each other again.\"\n Pulling back slightly, I looked at him. That was my fear as well, and my earlier conversation with Cary didn\u0027t help matters. He\u0027s a ticking time bomb...\n \"We\u0027ll figure it out,\" I said.\n He was quiet for a long moment. \"Has Nathan ever contacted you?\"\n \"No.\" Although I had a deep-rooted fear that I might see him again one day, whether accidentally or deliberately. He was out there somewhere, breathing the same air...\"Why?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-86.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
