{"id":63227,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Eva honey. Richard says you forgot your cell phone at his office.\" I exhaled in a rush and sagged back into my chair. I could picture the handkerchief wringing that usually accompanied that particular anxious tone of my mother\u0027s. It drove me nuts and it also broke my heart. \"Hi, Mom. How are you?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m lovely. Thank you.\" My mom had a voice that was both girlish and breathy, like Marilyn Monroe crossed with Scarlett Johansson. \"Clancy dropped your phone off with the concierge at your place. You really shouldn\u0027t go anywhere without it. You never know when you might need to call for someone - \" I\u0027d been debating the logistics of just keeping the phone and forwarding calls to a new number I didn\u0027t share with my mom, but that wasn\u0027t my biggest concern. \"What does Dr. Petersen say about you tracing my phone?\" The silence on the other end of the line was telling. \"Dr. Petersen knows I worry about you.\" Pinching the bridge of my nose, I said, \"I think it\u0027s time for us to have another joint appointment, Mom.\" \"Oh...of course. He did mention that he\u0027d like to see you again.\" Probably because he suspects you\u0027re not being forthcoming. I changed the subject. \"I really like my new job.\" \"That\u0027s wonderful, Eva! Is your boss treating you well?\" \"Yes, he\u0027s great. I couldn\u0027t ask for anyone better.\" \"Is he handsome?\" I smiled. \"Yes, very. And he\u0027s taken.\" \"Damn it. The good ones always are.\" She laughed and my smile widened. I loved it when she was happy. I wished she were happy more often. \"I can\u0027t wait to see you tomorrow at the advocacy dinner.\" Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton was in her element at society functions, a gilded shining beauty who\u0027d never lacked male attention in her life. \"Let\u0027s make a day of it,\" my mom said breathlessly. \"You, me, and Cary. We\u0027ll go to the spa, get pretty and polished. I\u0027m sure you could use a massage after working so hard.\" \"I won\u0027t turn one down, that\u0027s for sure. And I know Cary will love it.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m excited! I\u0027ll send a car by your place around eleven?\" \"We\u0027ll be ready.\" After I hung up, I leaned back in my chair and exhaled, needing a hot bath and an orgasm. If Gideon Cross somehow found out I masturbated while thinking about him, I didn\u0027t care. Being sexually frustrated was weakening my position, a weakness I knew he wouldn\u0027t be sharing. No doubt he\u0027d have a preapproved orifice lined up before day\u0027s end. As I swapped out my heels for my walking shoes, my phone rang again. My mother was rarely distracted for long. The five minutes since we\u0027d ended our call was just about the right length of time for her to realize the cell phone issue hadn\u0027t been resolved. Once again, I debated ignoring the phone, but I didn\u0027t want to take any of the day\u0027s crap home with me. I answered with my usual greeting, but it lacked its usual punch. \"I\u0027m still thinking about you.\" The velvet rasp of Cross\u0027s voice flooded me with such relief I realized I\u0027d been hoping to hear it again. Today. God. The craving was so acute I knew he\u0027d become a drug to my body, the prime source of some very intense highs. \"I can still feel you, Eva. Still taste you. I\u0027ve been hard since you left, through two meetings and one teleconference. You\u0027ve got the advantage, state your demands.\" \"Ah,\" I murmured. \"Lemme think.\" I let him wait, smiling as I remembered Cary\u0027s comment about blue balls. \"Hmm...Nothing is coming to mind. But I do have some friendly advice. Go spend time with a woman who salivates at your feet and makes you feel like a god. Fuck her until neither of you can walk. When you see me on Monday you\u0027ll be totally over it and your life will return to its usual obsessive-compulsive order.\" The creak of leather sounded over the phone and I imagined him leaning back in his desk chair. \"That was your one free pass, Eva. The next time you insult my intelligence, I\u0027ll take you over my knee.\" \"I don\u0027t like that sort of thing.\" And yet the warning, given in that voice, aroused me. Dark and Dangerous for sure. \"We\u0027ll discuss. In the interim, tell me what you do like.\" I stood. \"You definitely have the voice for phone sex, but I\u0027ve got to go. I have a date with my vibrator.\" I should\u0027ve hung up then, to gain the full effect of the brush-off, but I couldn\u0027t resist learning if he\u0027d gloat like I had imagined he would. Plus, I was having fun with him. \"Oh, Eva.\" Cross spoke my name in a decadent purr. \"You\u0027re determined to drive me to my knees, aren\u0027t you? What will it take to talk you into a threesome with B.O.B.?\" I ignored both questions as I slung my bag and purse over my shoulder, grateful he couldn\u0027t see how my hand shook. I was not discussing Battery Operated Boyfriends with Gideon Cross. I\u0027d never discussed mast***ation openly with a man, let alone a man who was for all intents and purposes a stranger to me. \"B.O.B. and I have a longtime understanding - when we\u0027re done with each other, we know exactly which one of us has been used, and it isn\u0027t me. Good night, Gideon.\" I hung up and took the stairs, deciding the twenty-floor descent would serve double-duty as both an avoidance technique and a replacement for a visit to the gym. I was so grateful to be home after the day I\u0027d had that I practically danced through my apartment\u0027s front door. My heartfelt \"God, it\u0027s good to be home!\" and accompanying spin was vehement enough to startle the couple on the couch. \"Oh,\" I said, wincing at my own silliness. Cary wasn\u0027t in a compromising position with his guest when I barged in, but they\u0027d been sitting close enough to suggest intimacy.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-15.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
