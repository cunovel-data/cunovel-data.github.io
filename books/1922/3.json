Although I made an effort to retrieve it without touching him, his fingers brushed mine, sending that charge of awareness into me all over again.\n \"Thank you,\" I muttered before skirting him and pushing out to the street through the revolving door. I paused on the sidewalk, gulping in a breath of New York air redolent with a million different things, some good and some toxic.\n There was a sleek black Bentley SUV in front of the building and I saw my reflection in the spotless limo tinted windows. I was flushed and my gray eyes were overly bright. I\u0027d seen that look on my face before - in the bathroom mirror just before I went to bed with a man. It was my I\u0027m-ready-to-fuck look and it had absolutely no business being on my face now.\n Christ. Get a grip.\n Five minutes with Mr. Dark and Dangerous, and I was filled with an edgy, restless energy. I could still feel the pull of him, the inexplicable urge to go back inside where he was. I could make the argument that I hadn\u0027t finished what I\u0027d come to the Crossfire to do, but I knew I\u0027d kick myself for it later. How many times was I going to make an ass of myself in one day?\n \"Enough,\" I scolded myself under my breath. \"Moving on.\"\n Horns blared as one cab darted in front of another with only inches to spare and then slammed on the brakes as daring pedestrians stepped into the intersection seconds before the light changed. Shouting ensued, a barrage of expletives and hand gestures that didn\u0027t carry real anger behind them. In seconds all the parties would forget the exchange, which was just one beat in the natural tempo of the city.\n As I melded into the flow of foot traffic and set off toward the gym, a smile teased my mouth. Ah, New York, I thought, feeling settled again. You rock.\n I\u0027d planned on warming up on a treadmill, then capping off the hour with a few of the machines, but when I saw that a beginners\u0027 kickboxing class was about to start, I followed the mass of waiting students into that instead. By the time it was over, I felt more like myself. My muscles quivered with the perfect amount of fatigue and I knew I\u0027d sleep hard when I crashed later.\n \"You did really well.\"\n I wiped the sweat off my face with a towel and looked at the young man who spoke to me. Lanky and sleekly muscular, he had keen brown eyes and flawless cafe au lait skin. His lashes were enviably thick and long, while his head was shaved bald.\n \"Thank you.\" My mouth twisted ruefully. \"Pretty obvious it was my first time, huh?\"\n He grinned and held out his hand. \"Parker Smith.\"\n \"Eva Tramell.\"\n \"You have a natural grace, Eva. With a little training you could be a literal knockout. In a city like New York, knowing self-defense is imperative.\" He gestured over to a corkboard hung on the wall. It was covered in thumbtacked business cards and fliers. Tearing off a flag from the bottom of a fluorescent sheet of paper, he held it out to me. \"Ever heard of Krav Maga?\"\n \"In a Jennifer Lopez movie.\"\n \"I teach it, and I\u0027d love to teach you. That\u0027s my website and the number to the studio.\"\n I admired his approach. It was direct, like his gaze, and his smile was genuine. I\u0027d wondered if he was angling toward a pickup, but he was cool enough about it that I couldn\u0027t be sure.\n Parker crossed his arms, which showed off cut biceps. He wore a black sleeveless shirt and long shorts. His Converse sneakers looked comfortably beat up and tribal tattoos peeked up from his collar. \"My website has the hours. You should come by and watch, see if it\u0027s for you.\"\n \"I\u0027ll definitely think about it.\"\n \"Do that.\" He extended his hand again, and his grip was solid and confident. \"I hope to see you.\"\n The apartment smelled fabulous when I got back home and Adele was crooning soulfully through the surround sound speakers about chasing pavements. I looked across the open floor plan into the kitchen and saw Cary swaying to the music while stirring something on the range. There was an open bottle of wine on the counter and two goblets, one of which was half-filled with red wine.\n \"Hey,\" I called out as I got closer. \"Whatcha cooking? And do I have time for a shower first?\"\n He poured wine into the other goblet and slid it across the breakfast bar to me, his movements practiced and elegant. No one would know from looking at him that he\u0027d spent his childhood bouncing between his drug-addicted mother and foster homes, followed by adolescence in juvenile detention facilities and state-run rehabs. \"Pasta with meat sauce. And hold the shower, dinner\u0027s ready. Have fun?\"\n \"Once I got to the gym, yeah.\" I pulled out one of the teakwood barstools and sat. I told him about the kickboxing class and Parker Smith. \"Wanna go with me?\"\n \"Krav Maga?\" Cary shook his head. \"That\u0027s hardcore. I\u0027d get all bruised up and that would cost me jobs. But I\u0027ll go with you to check it out, just in case this guy\u0027s a wack.\"\n I watched him dump the pasta into a waiting colander. \"A wack, huh?\"\n My dad had taught me to read guys pretty well, which was how I\u0027d known the god in the suit was trouble. Regular people offered token smiles when they helped someone, just to make a momentary connection that smoothed the way.\n Then again, I hadn\u0027t smiled at him either.\n \"Baby girl,\" Cary said, pulling bowls out of the cupboard, \"you\u0027re a sexy, stunning woman. I question any man who doesn\u0027t have the balls to ask you outright for a date.\"\n I wrinkled my nose at him.\n He set a bowl in front of me. It contained tiny tubes of salad noodles covered in a skimpy tomato sauce with lumps of ground beef and peas. \"You\u0027ve got something on your mind. What is it?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-3.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
