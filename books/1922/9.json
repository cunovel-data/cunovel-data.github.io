He said a few things to Mark about sports, I think, but I was too focused on the way I was reacting to him to care about the small talk. When the car arrived, I breathed a sigh of relief and hastily stepped forward with Mark. \"A moment, Eva,\" Cross said smoothly, holding me back with a hand at my elbow. \"She\u0027ll be right down,\" he told Mark, as the elevator doors closed on my boss\u0027s astonished face. Cross said nothing until the car was on its way down; then he pushed the call button again and asked, \"Are you sleeping with anyone?\" The question was asked so casually it took a second to process what he\u0027d said. I inhaled sharply. \"Why is that any business of yours?\" He looked at me and I saw what I\u0027d seen the first time we\u0027d met - tremendous power and steely control. Both of which had me taking an involuntary step back. Again. At least I didn\u0027t fall this time; I was making progress. \"Because I want to f**k you, Eva. I need to know what\u0027s standing in my way, if anything.\" The sudden ache between my thighs had me reaching for the wall to maintain my balance. He reached out to steady me, but I held him at bay with an uplifted hand. \"Maybe I\u0027m just not interested, Mr. Cross.\" A ghost of a smile touched his lips and made him impossibly more handsome. Dear God... The ding that signaled the approaching elevator made me jump, I was strung so tight. I\u0027d never been so aroused. Never been so scorchingly attracted to another human being. Never been so offended by a person I lusted after. I stepped into the elevator and faced him. He smiled. \"Until next time, Eva.\" The doors closed and I sagged into the brass handrail, trying to regain my bearings. I\u0027d barely pulled myself together when the doors opened and revealed Mark pacing in the waiting area on our floor. \"Jesus, Eva,\" Mark muttered, coming to an abrupt halt. \"What the hell was that?\" \"I have no freakin\u0027 clue.\" I exhaled in a rush, wishing I could share the confusing, irritating exchange I\u0027d had with Cross, but well aware that my boss wasn\u0027t the appropriate outlet. \"Who cares? You know he\u0027s going to give you the account.\" A grin chased away his frown. \"I\u0027m thinking he might.\" \"As my roommate always says, you should celebrate. Should I make dinner reservations for you and Steven?\" \"Why not? Pure Food and Wine at seven, if they can squeeze us in. If not, surprise us.\" We\u0027d barely returned to Mark\u0027s office when he was pounced on by the executives - Michael Waters, the CEO and president, and Christine Field and Walter Leaman, the executive chairman and vice chairman. I skirted the four of them as quietly as possible and slid into my cubicle. I called Pure Food and Wine and begged for a table for two. After some serious groveling and pleading, the hostess finally caved. I left a message on Mark\u0027s voice mail, \"It\u0027s definitely your lucky day. You\u0027re booked for dinner at seven. Have fun!\" Then I clocked out, eager to get home. \"He said what?\" Cary sat on the opposite end of our white sectional sofa and shook his head. \"I know, right?\" I enjoyed another sip of my wine. It was a crisp and nicely chilled sauvignon blanc I\u0027d picked up on the walk home. \"That was my reaction, too. I\u0027m still not sure I didn\u0027t hallucinate the conversation while overdosing on his pheromones.\" \"So?\" I tucked my legs beneath me on the couch and leaned into the corner. \"So what?\" \"You know what, Eva.\" Grabbing his netbook off the coffee table, Cary propped it on his crossed legs. \"Are you going to tap that or what?\" \"I don\u0027t even know him. I don\u0027t even know his first name and he threw that curveball at me.\" \"He knew yours.\" He started typing on his keyboard. \"And what about the thing with the vodka? Asking for your boss in particular?\" The hand I was running through my loose hair stilled. \"Mark is very talented. If Cross has any sort of business sense at all, he\u0027d pick up on that and exploit it.\" \"I\u0027d say he knows business.\" Cary spun his netbook around and showed me the home page of Cross Industries, which boasted an awesome photo of the Crossfire. \"That\u0027s his building, Eva. Gideon Cross owns it.\" Damn it. My eyes closed. Gideon Cross. I thought the name suited him. It was as sexy and elegantly masculine as the man himself. \"He has people to handle marketing for his subsidiaries. Probably dozens of people to handle it.\" \"Stop talking, Cary\" \"He\u0027s hot, rich, and wants to jump your bones. What\u0027s the problem?\" I looked at him. \"It\u0027s going to be awkward running into him all the time. I\u0027m hoping to hang on to my job for a long while. I really like it. I really like Mark. He\u0027s totally involved me in the process and I\u0027ve learned so much from him already.\" \"Remember what Dr. Travis says about calculated risks? When your shrink tells you to take some, you should take some. You can deal with it. You and Cross are both adults.\" He turned his attention back to his Internet search. \"Wow. Did you know he doesn\u0027t turn thirty for another two years? Think of the stamina.\" \"Think of the rudeness. I\u0027m offended by how he just threw it out there. I hate feeling like a vagina with legs.\" Cary paused and looked up at me, his eyes softening with sympathy. \"I\u0027m sorry, baby girl. You\u0027re so strong, so much stronger than I am. I just don\u0027t see you carrying around the baggage I do.\" \"I don\u0027t think I am, most of the time.\" I looked away because I didn\u0027t want to talk about what we\u0027d been through in our pasts. \"It\u0027s not like I wanted him to ask me out on a date. But there has to be a better way to tell a woman you want to take her to bed.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-9.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
