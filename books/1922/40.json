I\u0027ll bruise you if I don\u0027t get you soft and relaxed.\" A violent shiver of arousal moved through me. It turned me on when he talked so bluntly about sex. Then he slid lower and I tensed. \"No, Gideon. I need to shower for that.\" He buried his face in my cleft and I struggled against his hold, flushed with sudden shame. He nipped at my inner thigh with his teeth. \"Stop it.\" \"Don\u0027t. Please. You don\u0027t have to do that.\" His glare stilled my frantic movements. \"Do you think I feel differently about your body than you do mine?\" he asked harshly. \"I want you, Eva.\" I licked my dry lips, so crazily turned on by his animal need that I couldn\u0027t form a single word. He growled softly and dove for the slick flesh between my legs. His tongue pushed into me, licking and parting the sensitive tissues. My h*ps churned restlessly, my body silently begging for more. It felt so good I could\u0027ve wept. \"God, Eva. I\u0027ve wanted my mouth on your cunt every day since I met you.\" As the velvet softness of his tongue flickered over my swollen clit, my head pressed hard into the pillow. \"Yes. Like that. Make me come.\" He did, with the gentlest of suction and a hard lick. I writhed as the orgasm jolted through me, my core tensing violently, my limbs shaking. His tongue thrust into my sex as it convulsed, rippling along the shallow penetration, trying to pull him deeper. His groans vibrated against my swollen flesh, goading the cl**ax to roll on and on. Tears stung my eyes and coursed down my temples, the physical pleasure destroying the wall that kept my emotions at bay. And Gideon didn\u0027t stop. He circled the trembling entrance to my body with the tip of his tongue and lapped at my throbbing cl*t until I quickened again. Two fingers pushed inside me, curving and stroking. I was so sensitive I thrashed against the onslaught. When he drew on my cl*t with steady, rhythmic suction, I came again, crying out hoarsely. Then he had three fingers in me, twisting and opening me. \"No.\" My head tossed from side to side, every inch of my skin tingling and burning. \"No more.\" \"Once more,\" he coaxed hoarsely. \"Once more, then I\u0027ll f**k you.\" \"I can\u0027t...\" \"You will.\" He blew a slow stream of air over my wet flesh, the coolness over fevered skin reawakening raw nerve endings. \"I love watching you come, Eva. Love hearing the sounds you make, the way your body quivers...\" He massaged a tender spot inside me and an orgasm pulsed through me in a slow, heated roll of delight, no less devastating for being gentler than the two before it. His weight and heat left me. In a distant corner of my dazed mind, I heard a drawer opening, followed swiftly by the sound of foil tearing. The mattress dipped as he returned, his hands rough now as he yanked me down to the center of the bed. He stretched himself on top of me, pinning me, tucking his forearms on the outside of my biceps and pressing them to my sides, capturing me. My gaze was riveted to his austerely beautiful face. His features were harsh with lust, his skin stretched tight over his cheekbones and jaw. His eyes were so dark and dilated they were black, and I knew I was staring into the face of a man who\u0027d passed the limits of his control. It was important to me that he\u0027d made it that far for my benefit and that he\u0027d done so to pleasure and prepare me for what I knew would be a hard ride. My hands fisted in the bedspread, anticipation building. He\u0027d made sure I got mine, over and over again. This would be for him. \"Fuck me,\" I ordered, daring him with my eyes. \"Eva.\" He snapped out my name as he rammed into me, sinking balls-deep in one fierce drive. I gasped. He was big, hard as stone, and so damn deep. The connection was startlingly intense. Emotionally. Mentally. I\u0027d never felt so completely...taken. Possessed. I wouldn\u0027t have thought I could bear to be restrained during sex, not with my past being what it was, but Gideon\u0027s total domination of my body ratcheted my desire to an outrageous level. I\u0027d never been so hot for it in my life, which seemed insane after what I\u0027d experienced with him so far. I clenched around him, relishing the feel of him inside me, filling me. His h*ps ground against mine, prodding as if to say, Feel me? I\u0027m in you. I own you. His entire body hardened, the muscles of his chest and arms straining as he pulled out to the tip. The rigid tightening of his abs was the only warning I got before he slammed forward. Hard. I cried out and his chest rumbled with a low, primitive sound. \"Christ...You feel so good.\" Tightening his hold, he starting f**king me, nailing my h*ps to the mattress with wildly fierce drives. Pleasure rippled through me again, pushing through me with every hot shove of his body into mine. Like this, I thought. I want you just like this. He buried his face in my neck and held me tightly in place, plunging hard and fast, gasping raw, heated sex words that made me crazed with desire. \"I\u0027ve never been so hard and thick. I\u0027m so deep in you...I can feel it against my stomach...feel my dick pounding into you.\" I\u0027d thought of this round as his, and yet he was still with me, still focused on me, swiveling his h*ps to stroke pleasure through my melting core. I made a small, helpless sound of need and his mouth slanted over mine. I was desperate for him, my nails digging into his pumping hips, struggling with the grinding urge to rock into the ferocious thrusts of his big cock. We were dripping in sweat, our skin hot and slicked together, our chests heaving for air. As an orgasm brewed like a storm inside me, everything tightened and clenched, squeezing. He cursed and shoved one hand beneath my hip, cupping my rear and lifting me into his thrusts so that his c**k head stroked over and over the spot that ached for him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-40.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
