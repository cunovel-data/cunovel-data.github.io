He\u0027d been awake, watching me.\n How long had he been conscious? Was he as attuned to me while sleeping as I seemed to be to him?\n \"I love it.\" I love you.\n Setting the box aside, I turned my head to find him sitting up. His eyes glittered in a way that made me impossibly more aroused, but also sent a bite of fear through me. It was an unguarded look, like the one that had literally knocked me on my ass when we met - scorching and possessive, filled with dark threats of ecstasy. His gorgeous face was harsh in the shadows, his jaw taut as he lifted my right hand to his mouth and kissed the ring he\u0027d given me.\n I moved to kneel on the bed and draped my arms around his neck. \"Take me. Carte blanche.\"\n He cupped my butt and squeezed. \"How does it feel to say that?\"\n \"Almost as good as the orgasms you\u0027re going to give me.\"\n \"Ah, a challenge.\" The tip of his tongue teased the seam of my lips, tempting me with the promise of a kiss he deliberately withheld.\n \"Gideon!\"\n \"Lay back, angel, and grip your pillow with both hands.\" His mouth curved in a wicked smile. \"Don\u0027t let go for any reason. Understand?\"\n Swallowing hard, I did as I was told, so turned on I thought I might come from just the relentless spasming of my needy sex.\n He kicked the covers down to the footboard. \"Spread your legs and pull up your knees.\"\n My breath caught audibly as my ni**les hardened further, causing a deep ache in my br**sts. God, Gideon was hot as hell like this. I was panting with excitement, my mind spinning with the possibilities. The flesh between my legs trembled with want.\n \"Oh, Eva,\" he crooned, running his index finger through my slick cleft. \"Look how greedy you are for me. It\u0027s a full-time job keeping this sweet little cunt satisfied.\"\n That single rigid finger pushed into me, parting the swollen tissues. I tightened around him, so close to coming I could taste it. He withdrew and lifted his hand to his mouth, licking my flavor from his skin. My h*ps arched without volition, my body straining toward his.\n \"Your fault I\u0027m so hot for you,\" I gasped. \"You slacked on the job for days.\"\n \"Then I better make up for lost time.\" Sliding down into a prone position, he settled his shoulders beneath my thighs and rimmed the quivering entrance to my body with the tip of his tongue. Around and around. Ignoring my cl*t and refraining from f**king me even when I begged.\n \"Gideon, please.\"\n \"Shh. I have to get you ready first.\"\n \"I\u0027m ready. I was ready before you woke up.\"\n \"Then you should\u0027ve woken me earlier. I\u0027ll always take care of you, Eva. I live for it.\"\n Whimpering in distress, I rocked my h*ps into that teasing tongue. Only when I was soaked with my own arousal, creaming desperately for the feel of any part of him I could get inside me, did he crawl over me and settle between my spread thighs, placing his forearms flat on the bed.\n He held my gaze. His cock, feverishly hot and hard as stone, lay against the lips of my sex. I wanted it inside me more than I wanted to breathe. \"Now,\" I gasped. \"Now.\"\n With a practiced shift of his hips, he rammed deep into me, shoving me up the bed.\n \"Ah, God,\" I gasped, convulsing ecstatically around the thick column of flesh that possessed me. This was what I\u0027d needed since we\u0027d talked in his home office, what I\u0027d craved as I rode up and down his steely erection before dinner, what I\u0027d needed even as I cl**axed around his thick length.\n \"Don\u0027t come,\" he murmured in my ear, cupping my br**sts in his hands and rolling my ni**les between his thumb and forefingers.\n \"What?\" I was pretty sure if he\u0027d just take a deep breath I\u0027d go off.\n \"And don\u0027t let go of the pillow.\"\n Gideon began to move in a slow, lazy rhythm. \"You\u0027re going to want to,\" he murmured, nuzzling the sensitive spot beneath my ear. \"You love to grab my hair and rake your nails down my back. And when you\u0027re close to coming, you like to squeeze my ass and yank me deeper. Makes me so damn hard when you go wild like that, when you show me how much you love how I feel inside you.\"\n \"No fair,\" I moaned, knowing he was deliberately provoking me. The cadence of his raspy voice was perfectly timed with the relentless surging of his hips. \"You\u0027re torturing me.\"\n \"Good things come to those who wait.\" His tongue traced the shell of my ear, and then dipped inside at the same moment he tugged on my ni**les.\n I bucked into his next thrust and nearly came. Gideon knew my body so well, knew all its secrets and erogenous zones. He was expertly stroking his c**k inside me, rubbing over and over the tender bundle of nerves that quivered in delight.\n Rolling his hips, he screwed into me, exploiting other spots. I made a plaintive sound, on fire for him, desperately infatuated. My fingers cramped with the grip I had on my pillow, my head thrashing against the driving need to orgasm. He could get me there just by rubbing inside me, the only man who\u0027d ever been skilled enough to give me an intense vaginal orgasm.\n \"Don\u0027t come,\" he repeated, his voice hoarse. \"Make it last.\"\n \"I c-can\u0027t. It feels too good. God, Gideon...\" Tears leaked out of the corners of my eyes. \"I...I\u0027m lost in you.\"\n I cried softly, afraid to say the other L-word too soon and risk upsetting the delicate balance between us.\n \"Oh, Eva.\" He rubbed his cheek against my damp face. \"I must\u0027ve wished for you so hard and so often you had no choice but to come true.\"\n \"Please,\" I begged softly. \"Slow down.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-76.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
