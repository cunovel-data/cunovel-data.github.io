What assurances could I give him, when I wasn\u0027t sure my love and his need would be enough to make our relationship work?\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going through your mind?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Thoughts of food. I\u0027m starving. Why don\u0027t you go see if Cary wants to eat? Then we can get started on dinner.\"\\n\\n Gideon found Cary sleeping, so he and I ate a candlelit dinner for two at the dining table, a somewhat formal meal while lounging in the worn T-shirts and pajama bottoms we\u0027d put on after our respective showers. I was worried about Cary, but spending quiet downtime alone with Gideon felt like just what we needed.\\n\\n \"I had lunch with Magdalene in my office yesterday,\" he said after we\u0027d enjoyed a few initial bites.\\n\\n \"Oh?\" While I\u0027d been ring shopping, Magdalene had been enjoying private time with my man?\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t take that tone,\" he admonished. \"She ate a meal in an office covered in your flowers, with you blowing kisses from my desk. You were as much there as she was.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. Knee-jerk reaction.\"\\n\\n He lifted my hand to his mouth and pressed a quick, hard kiss to the back. \"I\u0027m relieved you can still get jealous over me.\"\\n\\n I sighed. My emotions had been all over the map all day; I couldn\u0027t decide how I felt about anything. \"Did you say anything to her about Christopher?\"\\n\\n \"That was the point of the lunch. I showed her the video.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I frowned, remembering my phone had died in his car. \"How\u0027d you do that?\"\\n\\n \"I took your phone up to my office and pulled the video off via USB. Didn\u0027t you notice I brought it back last night, fully charged?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I set my silverware down. Dominant or not, Gideon and I were going to have to work on which lines crossed over into my freak-out zone. \"You can\u0027t just hack into my phone, Gideon.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t hack into it. You haven\u0027t set a password yet.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not the point! It\u0027s a serious invasion of my f**king privacy. Jesus...\" Why in hell did no one in my life understand that I had boundaries? \"Would you like me rummaging through your stuff?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got nothing to hide.\" He pulled his smartphone out of an inner pocket of his sweats and held it out to me. \"And you won\u0027t either.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to get into a fight now, things were too shaky as it was, but I\u0027d let this go long enough. \"It doesn\u0027t matter whether or not I have something I don\u0027t want you to see. I have a right to space and privacy, and you need to ask before you help yourself to my information and my belongings. You have to stop taking whatever you want without my permission.\"\\n\\n \"What was private about it?\u0027 he asked with a frown. \"You showed it to me yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be like my mother, Gideon!\" I shouted. \"There\u0027s only so much crazy I can handle.\"\\n\\n He jerked back at my vehemence, clearly surprised by how upset I was. \"Okay. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n I gulped down my wine, trying to rein in my temper and unease. \"Sorry I\u0027m mad? Or sorry you did it?\"\\n\\n After the length of several heartbeats, Gideon said, \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re mad.\"\\n\\n He really didn\u0027t get it. \"Why don\u0027t you see how weird this is?\"\\n\\n \"Eva.\" He sighed and shoved a hand through his hair. \"I spend a quarter of every day inside you. When you set limits outside of that I can\u0027t help but see them as arbitrary.\"\\n\\n \"Well, they\u0027re not. They\u0027re important to me. If there\u0027s something you want to know, you need to ask me.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do it anymore,\" I warned. \"I\u0027m not kidding, Gideon.\"\\n\\n His jaw tightened. \"Okay. I get it.\"\\n\\n Then, because I really didn\u0027t want to fight, I moved on. \"What did she say when she saw it?\"\\n\\n He visibly relaxed. \"It was difficult, of course. Even more difficult to know I\u0027d seen it.\"\\n\\n \"She saw us in the library.\"\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t talk about that directly, but then, what was there to say? I won\u0027t apologize for making love to my girlfriend in a closed room.\" He leaned back in his chair and exhaled harshly. \"Seeing Christopher\u0027s face on the video - seeing what he really thought of her - that hurt her. It\u0027s hard to see yourself being used that way. Especially by someone you think you know, someone who\u0027s supposed to care about you.\"\\n\\n To hide my reaction, I busied myself with refilling both my glass and his. He spoke as if from experience. What exactly had been done to him?\\n\\n After a quick gulp of wine, I asked, \"How are you doing with it?\"\\n\\n \"What can I do? Over the years, I\u0027ve made every attempt to talk to Christopher. I\u0027ve tried throwing money at him. I\u0027ve tried threatening him. He\u0027s never shown any inclination to change. I realized long ago that I can only do damage control. And keep you as far away from him as possible.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be helping you with that, now that I know.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" He took a drink, eyeing me over the lip of his glass. \"You\u0027re not asking me about my appointment with Dr. Petersen.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s none of my business. Unless you want to share.\" I met his gaze, willing him to do just that. \"I\u0027m here to listen whenever you need an ear, but I\u0027m not going to pry. When you\u0027re ready to let me in, you will. That said, I\u0027d love to know if you like him.\"\\n\\n \"So far.\" He smiled. \"He talks me around in circles. Not many people can do that.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-87.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
