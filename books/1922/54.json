{"id":63266,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"\"Gideon - \"\n \"I would destroy the career of any reporter who wrote about this, and then I\u0027d dismantle the publication that ran the piece.\" He was so cold with fury, he was icy. \"I\u0027m going to find the monster who hurt you, Eva, wherever he is, and I\u0027m going to make him wish he was dead.\"\n A shiver moved through me, because I believed him. It was in his face. His voice. In the energy he exuded and his sharply honed focus. He wasn\u0027t just dark and dangerous in his looks. Gideon was a man who got what he wanted, whatever it took.\n I pushed to my feet. \"He\u0027s not worth the effort. Not worth your time.\"\n \"You are. You\u0027re worth it. Damn it. Goddamn it to hell.\"\n I moved closer to the fireplace, needing the warmth. \"There\u0027s also a money trail. Cops and reporters always follow the money. Someone may wonder why my mother left her first marriage with two million dollars, but her daughter from a previous relationship left with five.\"\n Without looking, I felt his sudden stillness. \"Of course,\" I went on, \"that blood money\u0027s probably grown to considerably more than that now. I won\u0027t touch it, but Stanton manages the brokerage account I dumped it in and everyone knows he has the Midas touch. If you ever had any concern that I wanted your money - \"\n \"Stop talking.\"\n I turned to face him. I saw his face, his eyes. Saw the pity and horror. But it was what I didn\u0027t see that hurt the most.\n It was my greatest nightmare realized. I\u0027d feared that my past might negatively impact his attraction to me. I\u0027d told Cary that Gideon might stay with me for all the wrong reasons. That he might stay by my side, but that I\u0027d still - for all intents and purposes - lose him anyway.\n And it seemed I had.\n Chapter 13\n I tightened the belt on my robe. \"I\u0027m going to get dressed and go.\"\n \"What?\" Gideon glared. \"Go where?\"\n \"Home,\" I said, weary to the bone. \"I think you need to digest all this.\"\n His arms crossed. \"We can do that together.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think we can.\" My chin lifted, grief overwhelming my shame and heartrending disappointment. \"Not while you\u0027re looking at me like you feel sorry for me.\"\n \"I\u0027m not made of f**king stone, Eva. I wouldn\u0027t be human if I didn\u0027t care.\"\n The emotions I\u0027d run through since lunch coalesced into a searing pain in my chest and a cleansing burst of anger. \"I don\u0027t want your goddamn pity.\"\n He shoved both hands through his hair. \"What the hell do you want, then?\"\n \"You! I want you.\"\n \"You have me. How many times do I have to tell you that?\"\n \"Your words don\u0027t mean shit when you can\u0027t back them up. From the moment we met, you\u0027ve been hot for me. You haven\u0027t been able to look at me without making it damn clear you want to f**k my brains out. And that\u0027s gone, Gideon.\" My eyes burned. \"That look...it\u0027s gone.\"\n \"You can\u0027t be serious.\" He stared at me as if I\u0027d grown two heads.\n \"I don\u0027t think you know how your desire makes me feel.\" My arms wrapped around me, covering my br**sts. I suddenly felt na**d in the worst way. \"It makes me feel beautiful. It makes me feel strong and alive. I - I can\u0027t bear to be with you if you don\u0027t feel that way about me anymore.\"\n \"Eva, I...\" His voice faded into silence. He was hard-faced and distant, his fists clenched at his sides.\n I loosened the sash of my robe and shrugged the whole garment off me. \"Look at me, Gideon. Look at my body. It\u0027s the same one you couldn\u0027t get enough of last night. The same one you were so desperate to get into that you took me to that damn hotel room. If you don\u0027t want this anymore...if you don\u0027t get hard looking at it - \"\n \"Is this hard enough for you?\" He broke the drawstring of his pants pushing them down to expose the heavy, thickly-veined length of his erection.\n We both lunged at the same time, colliding. Our mouths slid over each other as he lifted me to wrap my legs around his hips. He stumbled to the couch and fell, catching our combined weight with one outstretched hand.\n I sprawled beneath him, breathless and sobbing, while he slid to his knees on the floor and tongued my cleft. He was rough and impatient, lacking the finesse I\u0027d become used to, and I loved that he was. Loved it more when he levered over me and shoved his c**k into me. I wasn\u0027t yet fully wet and the burn made me gasp, then his thumb was on my clit, rubbing in circles that had my h*ps churning.\n \"Yes,\" I moaned, raking my nails down his back. He wasn\u0027t icy anymore. He was on fire. \"Fuck me, Gideon. Fuck me hard.\"\n \"Eva.\" His mouth covered mine. He fisted my hair, holding me still as he lunged again and again, pounding hard and deep. He kicked off the armrest with one foot, powering into me, driving toward his orgasm with single-minded ferocity. \"Mine...mine...mine...\"\n The rhythmic slap of his heavy balls against the curve of my bu**ocks and the harshness of his possessive litany drove me insane with lust. I felt myself quickening with every twinge of pain, felt my sex tightening with my growing arousal.\n With a long, guttural groan he started coming, his flexing body quaking as he emptied himself inside me.\n I held him as he cl**axed, stroking his back, pressing kisses along his shoulder.\n \"Hold on,\" he said roughly, pushing his hands beneath me and flattening my br**sts against him.\n Gideon pulled me up, and then sat down with me straddling his hips. I was slick from his orgasm, making it easy for him to push back inside me.\n His hands brushed the hair away from my face; then wiped my tears of relief. \"I\u0027m always hard for you, always hot for you. I\u0027m always half-crazy with wanting you. If anything could change that, I would\u0027ve done it before we got this far. Understand?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-54.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
