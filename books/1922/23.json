The robe gave way to his dexterous fingers; then he was cupping my br**sts, kneading them with soft, rhythmic squeezes.\\n\\n \"Gideon - \"\\n\\n \"Shh.\" He sucked on my lower lip, his fingers rolling and tugging my tender ni**les. \"It was driving me crazy knowing you were na**d beneath your robe.\"\\n\\n \"You came over without - Oh! Oh, God...\"\\n\\n His mouth surrounded the tip of my breast, the wash of heat bringing a mist of perspiration to my skin.\\n\\n My gaze darted frantically to the clock on the cable box. \"Gideon, no.\"\\n\\n His head lifted and he looked at me with stormy blue eyes. \"It\u0027s insane, I know. I don\u0027t - I can\u0027t explain it, Eva, but I have to make you come. I\u0027ve been thinking about it constantly for days now.\"\\n\\n One of his hands pushed between my legs. They fell open shamelessly, my body so aroused I was flushed and almost feverish. His other hand continued to plump my br**sts, making them heavy and unbearably sensitive.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wet for me,\" he murmured, his gaze sliding down my body to where he was parting me with his fingers. \"You\u0027re beautiful here, too. Plush and pink. So soft. You didn\u0027t wax today, did you?\"\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \"Thank God. I don\u0027t think I would\u0027ve made it ten minutes without touching you, let alone ten hours.\" He slid one finger carefully into me.\\n\\n My eyes closed against the unbearable vulnerability of being spread out na**d and fingered by a man whose familiarity with the rules of Brazilian waxing betrayed an intimate knowledge of women. A man who was still fully clothed and kneeling on the floor beside me.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so snug.\" Gideon pulled out and thrust gently back into me. My back bowed as I clenched eagerly around him. \"And so greedy. How long has it been since the last time you were f**ked?\"\\n\\n I swallowed hard. \"I\u0027ve been busy. My thesis, job-hunting, moving...\"\\n\\n \"A while, then.\" He pulled out and pushed back into me with two fingers. I couldn\u0027t hold back a moan of delight. The man had talented hands, confident and skilled, and he took what he wanted with them.\\n\\n \"Are you on birth control, Eva?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" My hands gripped the edges of the cushions. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll prove I\u0027m clean and you\u0027ll do the same, then you\u0027re going to let me come in you.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Gideon.\" I was panting for him, my h*ps circling shamelessly onto his thrusting fingers. I felt like I\u0027d spontaneously combust if he didn\u0027t get me off.\\n\\n I\u0027d never been so turned on in my life. I was near mindless with the need for an orgasm. If Cary walked in right then and found me writhing in our living room while Gideon finger-fucked me, I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d care.\\n\\n Gideon was breathing hard, too. His face was flushed with lust. For me. When I\u0027d done nothing more than respond helplessly to him.\\n\\n His hand at my breast moved to my cheek and brushed over it. \"You\u0027re blushing. I\u0027ve scandalized you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n His smile was both wicked and delighted, and it made my chest tight. \"I want to feel my cum in you when I f**k you with my fingers. I want you to feel my cum in you, so you think about how I looked and the sounds I made when I pumped it into you. And while you\u0027re thinking about that, you\u0027re going to look forward to me doing it again and again.\"\\n\\n My sex rippled around his stroking fingers, the rawness of his words pushing me to the brink of orgasm.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to tell you all the ways I want you to please me, Eva, and you\u0027re going to do it all...take it all, and we\u0027re going to have explosive, primal, no-holds-barred sex. You know that, don\u0027t you? You can feel how it\u0027ll be between us.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I breathed, clutching my br**sts to ease the deep ache of my hardened ni**les. \"Please, Gideon.\"\\n\\n \"Shh...I\u0027ve got you.\" The pad of his thumb rubbed my clitoris in gentle circles. \"Look into my eyes when you come for me.\"\\n\\n Everything tightened in my core, the tension building as he massaged my cl*t and pushed his fingers in and out in a steady, unhurried rhythm.\\n\\n \"Give it up to me, Eva,\" he ordered. \"Now.\"\\n\\n I cl**axed with a thready cry, my grip white-knuckled on the sides of the cushions as my h*ps pumped onto his hand, my mind far beyond shame or shyness. My gaze was locked to his, unable to look away, riveted by the fierce masculine triumph that flared in his eyes. In that moment he owned me. I\u0027d do anything he wanted. And he knew it.\\n\\n Searing pleasure pulsed through me. Through the roaring of blood in my ears, I thought I heard him speak hoarsely, but I lost the words when he hooked one of my legs over the back of the couch and covered my cleft with his mouth.\\n\\n \"No - \" I pushed at his head with my hands. \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I was too swollen, too sensitive. But when his tongue touched my clit, fluttering over it, the hunger built again. More intense than the first time. He rimmed my trembling slit, teasing me, taunting me with the promise of another orgasm when I knew I couldn\u0027t have one again so quickly.\\n\\n Then his tongue speared into me and I bit my lip to bite back a scream. I came a second time, my body quaking violently, tender muscles tightening desperately around his decadent licking. His growl vibrated through me. I didn\u0027t have the strength to push him away when he returned to my cl*t and sucked softly...tirelessly...until I cl**axed again, gasping his name.\\n\\n I was boneless as he straightened my leg and still breathless when he pressed kisses up my belly to my br**sts. He licked each of my ni**les, and then hauled me up with his arms banded around my back. I hung lax and pliable in his grip while he took my mouth with suppressed violence, bruising my lips and betraying how close to the edge he was. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-23.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
