I\u0027m sick with jealousy right now.\"\n \"It was just sex with her, angel. As raw as you and I f**k, it\u0027s still making love. Every time, from the very first time. You\u0027re the only one who\u0027s ever gotten to me that way.\"\n I heaved out a breath. \"Okay. I\u0027m marginally better.\"\n He kissed me. \"I guess you could say we dated. We were exclusive sexually and we often ended up going to the same places as a couple. Still, when she told me she loved me, I was surprised. And flattered. I cared about her. I enjoyed spending time with her.\"\n \"Still do, apparently,\" I muttered.\n \"Keep listening.\" He chastised me with a tap of his finger to the end of my nose. \"I thought maybe I might love her, too, in my own way...the only way I knew how. I didn\u0027t want her to be with anyone else. So I said yes when she proposed.\"\n I jerked back to look at him. \"She proposed?\"\n \"Don\u0027t look so shocked,\" he said wryly. \"You\u0027re bruising my ego.\"\n Relief flooded me in a rush that made me dizzy. I threw myself at him, hugging him as tight as I could.\n \"Hey.\" His returning embrace was just as fierce. \"You okay?\"\n \"Yes. Yes, I\u0027m getting there.\" I pulled back and cupped his jaw in my hand. \"Keep going.\"\n \"I said yes for all the wrong reasons. After two years of hanging out, we\u0027d never spent a full night together. Never talked about any of the things I talk to you about. She didn\u0027t know me, not really, and yet I convinced myself that being loved at all was something to hang on to. Who else was going to do it right, if not her?\"\n He moved his attention to my other eye, cleaning away the black streaks. \"I think she was hoping that being engaged would take us to a different level. Maybe I\u0027d open up more. Maybe we\u0027d stay the night at the hotel - which she thought was romantic, by the way - instead of calling it an early night because of classes in the morning. I don\u0027t know.\"\n I thought it sounded terribly lonely. My poor Gideon. He\u0027d been alone for so long. Maybe his whole life.\n \"And maybe when she broke it off after a year,\" he went on, \"she was hoping that would kick-start things, too. That I\u0027d make a bigger effort to keep her. Instead, I was relieved because I\u0027d started to realize it was going to be impossible to share a home with her. What excuse was I going to come up with to sleep in separate rooms and have my own space?\"\n \"You never considered telling her?\"\n \"No.\" He shrugged. \"Until you, I didn\u0027t consider my past an issue. Yes, it affected certain ways I did things, but everything had its place and I wasn\u0027t unhappy. In fact, I thought I had a comfortable and uncomplicated life.\"\n \"Oh, boy.\" My nose wrinkled. \"Hello, Mr. Comfortable. I\u0027m Miss Complicated.\"\n His grin flashed. \"Never a dull moment.\"\n Chapter 22\n Gideon tossed the makeup remover wipe in the trash. Then he grabbed a towel to throw over the puddle he\u0027d left on the floor and toed off his shoes. To my utter delight, he began stripping out of his wet clothes.\n Watching him raptly, I said, \"You feel guilty because she still loves you.\"\n \"I do, yes. I knew her husband. He was a good guy and he was crazy about her, until he figured out she didn\u0027t feel the same way and things fell apart.\"\n He looked at me as he peeled his shirt off. \"I couldn\u0027t figure out why he let it get to him. He was married to the girl he wanted, they lived in a different country away from me, so what was his problem? Now, I understand. If you loved someone else, Eva, it\u0027d shred me to pieces, every single day. It\u0027d kill me even if you were with me and not him. But unlike Giroux, I wouldn\u0027t let you go. Maybe I wouldn\u0027t have all of you, but you\u0027d still be mine and I\u0027d take what I could get.\"\n My fingers laced in my lap. \"That\u0027s what scares me, Gideon. You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re worth.\"\n \"Actually, I do. Twelve bill - \"\n \"Shut up.\" My head spun and I pressed my fingertips to my eyes. \"It shouldn\u0027t be such a mystery that women fall in love with you and stay in love. Did you know that Magdalene kept her hair long hoping it\u0027d remind you of Corinne?\"\n He dropped his slacks and frowned at me. \"Why?\"\n I sighed at his cluelessness. \"Because she believes Corinne is who you want.\"\n \"Then she\u0027s not paying attention.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t she? Corinne told me she talks to you almost every day.\"\n \"Not quite. I\u0027m often not available. You know how busy I am.\" His gaze took on the heated look I was so familiar with. I knew he was thinking about the times he got busy with me.\n \"That\u0027s nuts, Gideon. Her calling every day. That\u0027s stalking.\" Which reminded me of her assertion that he\u0027d been as possessive over her as he was about me. That niggled at me in a terrible way.\n \"Where are you going with this?\" he asked, in a voice laced with warm amusement.\n \"Don\u0027t you get it? You drive women off the deep end because you\u0027re the ultimate. You\u0027re the grand prize. If a woman can\u0027t have you, they know they\u0027re settling for less than the best. So they can\u0027t think about not having you. They just think of crazy ways to try and get you.\"\n \"Except for the one I want,\" he retorted dryly, \"who spends a lot of time running in the opposite direction.\"\n I stared unabashedly, drinking him in as he stood na**d in front of me. \"Answer one question for me, Gideon. Why do you want me, when you can have your pick of perfection instead? And I\u0027m not fishing for compliments or reassurances. I\u0027m asking an honest question.\"\n He caught me up and moved us into the bedroom. \"Eva, if you don\u0027t stop thinking of us as temporary, I\u0027m going to take you over my knee and make damn sure you like it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-96.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
