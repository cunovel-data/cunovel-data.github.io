Or you can make it difficult.\" His tone took on a hard edge that made my pulse quicken. \"Either way, you\u0027ll hear me out.\"\n I closed my eyes, understanding that I wasn\u0027t lucky enough to get away with a quick good-bye phone chat. \"Fine. I\u0027ll come up.\"\n \"Thank you.\" He exhaled audibly. \"I can\u0027t wait to see you.\"\n I returned the receiver to its cradle and stared at the photos on my desk, trying to formulate what I needed to say and steeling myself for the impact of seeing Gideon again. The ferocity of my physical response to him was impossible to control. Somehow I\u0027d have to get past it and take care of business. Later, I\u0027d think about having to see him in the building over the days, weeks, and months ahead. For the moment, I just had to focus on making it through lunch.\n Yielding to the inevitable, I got back to work comparing the visual impact of some blow-in card samples.\n \"Eva.\"\n I jumped and spun around in my chair, startled to find Gideon standing beside my cubicle. The sight of him blew me away, as usual, and my heart stuttered in my chest. A quick glance at the clock proved that a quarter hour had passed in no time at all.\n \"Gid - Mr. Cross. You didn\u0027t have to come down here.\"\n His face was calm and impassive, but his eyes were stormy and hot. \"Ready?\"\n I opened my drawer and pulled out my purse, taking the opportunity to suck in a deep, shaky breath. He smelled phenomenal and looked even better.\n \"Mr. Cross.\" Mark\u0027s voice. \"It\u0027s great to see you. Is there something - ?\"\n \"I\u0027m here for Eva. We have a lunch date.\"\n I straightened in time to see Mark\u0027s brows shoot up. He recovered quickly, his face smoothing into its usual good-natured handsomeness.\n \"I\u0027ll be back at one,\" I assured him.\n \"See you then. Enjoy your lunch.\"\n Gideon put his hand at the small of my back and steered me out to the elevators, garnering raised brows from Megumi when we passed reception. I shifted restlessly as he hit the call button for the elevator, wishing I could\u0027ve made it through the day without seeing the man whose touch I craved like a drug.\n He faced me as we waited for the car, running his fingertips down the sleeve of my satin blouse. \"Every time I close my eyes, I see you in that red dress. I hear the sounds you make when you\u0027re turned on. I feel you sliding over my cock, squeezing me like a fist, making me come so hard it hurts.\"\n \"Don\u0027t.\" I looked away, unable to bear the intimate way he was looking at me.\n \"I can\u0027t help it.\"\n The arrival of the elevator was a relief. He caught my hand and pulled me inside. After he put his key in the panel, he tugged me closer. \"I\u0027m going to kiss you, Eva.\"\n \"I don\u0027t - \"\n He pulled me into him and sealed his mouth over mine. I resisted as long as I could; then I melted at the feel of his tongue stroking slow and sweet over mine. I\u0027d wanted his kiss since we\u0027d had sex. I wanted the reassurance that he valued what we\u0027d shared, that it meant something to him as it had to me.\n I was left bereft once again when he pulled away.\n \"Come on.\" He pulled the key out as the door opened.\n Gideon\u0027s redheaded receptionist said nothing this time, although she eyed me strangely. In contrast, Gideon\u0027s secretary, Scott, stood when we approached and greeted me pleasantly by name.\n \"Good afternoon, Miss Tramell.\"\n \"Hi, Scott.\"\n Gideon gave him a curt nod. \"Hold my calls.\"\n \"Yes, of course.\"\n I entered Gideon\u0027s expansive office, my gaze drifting to the sofa where he\u0027d first touched me intimately.\n Lunch was arranged on the bar - two plates covered in metal salvers.\n \"Can I take your purse?\" he asked.\n I looked at him, saw he\u0027d taken off his jacket and slung it over his arm. He stood there in his tailored slacks and vest, his shirt and tie both a pristine white, his hair dark and thick around his breathtaking face, his eyes a wild and dazzling blue. In a word, he amazed me. I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d made love to such a gorgeous man.\n But then, it hadn\u0027t meant the same thing to him.\n \"Eva?\"\n \"You\u0027re beautiful, Gideon.\" The words fell out of my mouth without conscious thought.\n His brows lifted; then a softness came into his eyes. \"I\u0027m glad you like what you see.\"\n I handed him my purse and moved away, needing the space. He hung his coat and my purse on the coatrack, then moved to the bar.\n I crossed my arms. \"Let\u0027s just get this over with. I don\u0027t want to see you anymore.\"\n Chapter 8\n Gideon shoved a hand through his hair and exhaled harshly. \"You don\u0027t mean that.\"\n I was suddenly very tired, exhausted from fighting with myself over him. \"I really do. You and me...it was a mistake.\"\n His jaw tightened. \"It wasn\u0027t. The way I handled it afterward was the mistake.\"\n I stared at him, startled by the fierceness of his denial. \"I wasn\u0027t talking about the sex, Gideon. I\u0027m talking about my agreeing to this crazy strangers-with-benefits deal between us. I knew it was all wrong from the beginning. I should\u0027ve listened to my instincts.\"\n \"Do you want to be with me, Eva?\"\n \"No. That\u0027s what - \"\n \"Not like we discussed at the bar. More than that.\"\n My heart started to pound. \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"Everything.\" He left the bar and came closer. \"I want to be with you.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t seem like you did Saturday.\" My arms tightened around my middle.\n \"I was...reeling.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-33.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
