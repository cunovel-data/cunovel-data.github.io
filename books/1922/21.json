{"id":63233,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"You two seemed cozy last night. He\u0027s definitely into you.\" \"I\u0027m definitely into him.\" Curling into the corner of the couch, I pressed my cheek into the cushion and hugged my legs to my chest. \"We\u0027re going to hang out, get to know each other, have casual-but-physically-intense sex, and be otherwise completely independent. No strings, no expectations, no responsibilities.\" Cary hit a button on his netbook and the printer on the other side of the room started spitting out pages. Then he snapped the computer closed, set it on the coffee table, and gave me all his attention. \"Maybe it\u0027ll turn into something serious.\" \"Maybe not,\" I scoffed. \"Cynic.\" \"I\u0027m not looking for happily-ever-after, Cary, especially not with a mega-mogul like Cross. I\u0027ve seen what it\u0027s like for my mom being connected to powerful men. It\u0027s a full-time job with a part-time companion. Money keeps Mom happy, but it wouldn\u0027t be enough for me.\" My dad had loved my mom. He\u0027d asked her to marry him and share his life. She\u0027d turned him down because he didn\u0027t have the hefty portfolio and sizeable bank account she required in a husband. Love wasn\u0027t a requisite for marriage in Monica Stanton\u0027s opinion and since her sultry-eyed, breathy-voiced beauty was irresistible to most men, she\u0027d never had to settle for less than whatever she wanted. Unfortunately she hadn\u0027t wanted my dad for the long haul. Glancing at the clock, I saw it was ten thirty. \"I guess I should get ready.\" \"I love spa day with your mom.\" Cary smiled and it chased the lingering shadows on my mood away. \"I feel like a god when we\u0027re done.\" \"Me, too. Of the goddess persuasion.\" We were so eager to be off that we went downstairs to meet the car rather than wait for the front desk to call up. The doorman smiled as we stepped outside - me in heeled sandals and a maxi dress, and Cary in hip-hugging jeans and a long-sleeved T-shirt. \"Good morning, Miss Tramell. Mr. Taylor. Will you need a cab today?\" \"No thanks, Paul. We\u0027re expecting a car.\" Cary grinned. \"It\u0027s spa day at Perrini\u0027s!\" \"Ah, Perrini\u0027s Day Spa.\" Paul gave a sage nod. \"I bought my wife a gift certificate for our anniversary. She enjoyed it so much I plan to make it a tradition.\" \"You did good, Paul,\" I said. \"Pampering a woman never goes out of style.\" A black town car pulled up with Clancy at the wheel. Paul opened the rear door for us and we climbed in, squealing when we found a box of Knipschildt\u0027s Chocopologie on the seat. Waving at Paul, we settled back and dug in, taking tiny nibbles of the truffles that were worth savoring slowly. Clancy drove us straight to Perrini\u0027s, where the relaxation began from the moment one walked in the door. Crossing the entrance threshold was like taking a vacation on the far side of the world. Every arched doorway was framed by lushly vibrant striped silks, while jeweled pillows decorated elegant chaises and oversized armchairs. Birds chirped from suspended gilded cages and potted plants filled every corner with lush fronds. Small decorative fountains added the sounds of running water, while stringed instrumental music was piped into the room via cleverly hidden speakers. The air was redolent with a mix of exotic spices and fragrances, making me feel like I\u0027d stepped into Arabian Nights. It was this-close to being too much, but it didn\u0027t cross the line. Instead, Perrini\u0027s was exotic and luxurious, an indulgent treat for those who could afford it. Like my mother, who\u0027d just finished a milk-and-honey bath when we arrived. I studied the menu of treatments available, deciding to skip my usual \"warrior woman\" in favor of the \"passionate pampering.\" I\u0027d been waxed the week before, but the rest of the treatment - \"designed to make you sexually irresistible\" - sounded like exactly what I needed. I\u0027d finally managed to get my mind back into the safe zone of work when Cary spoke up from the pedicure chair beside mine. \"Mrs. Stanton, have you met Gideon Cross?\" I gaped at him. He knew damn well my mom went nuts over any news about my romantic - and not-so-romantic, as the case may be - relationships. My mother, who sat in the chair on the other side of me, leaned forward with her usual girlish excitement over a rich, handsome man. \"Of course. He\u0027s one of the wealthiest men in the world. Number twenty-five or so on Forbes\u0027s list, if I\u0027m remembering correctly. A very driven young man, obviously, and a generous benefactor to many of the children\u0027s charities I champion. Extremely eligible, of course, but I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s g*y, Cary. He\u0027s got a reputation as a ladies\u0027 man.\" \"My loss.\" Cary grinned and ignored my violent headshaking. \"But it\u0027d be a hopeless crush anyway, since he\u0027s digging on Eva.\" \"Eva! I can\u0027t believe you didn\u0027t say anything. How could you not tell me something like that?\" I looked at my mom, whose scrubbed face appeared young, unlined, and very much like mine. I was very clearly my mother\u0027s daughter, right down to my surname. The one concession she\u0027d made to my father had been to name me after his mother. \"There\u0027s nothing to tell,\" I insisted. \"We\u0027re just...friends.\" \"We can do better than that,\" Monica said, with a look of calculation that struck fear in my heart. \"I don\u0027t know how it escaped me that you work in the same building he does. I\u0027m certain he was smitten the moment he saw you. Although he\u0027s known to prefer brunettes...Hmm...Anyway. He\u0027s also known for his excellent taste. Clearly the latter won out with you.\" \"It\u0027s not like that. Please don\u0027t start meddling. You\u0027ll embarrass me.\" \"Nonsense. If anyone knows what to do with men, it\u0027s me.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-21.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
