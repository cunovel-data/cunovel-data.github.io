That dress is amazing on you and so are those f**k-me red heels.\"\n \"Well, clearly they work.\" I bumped my shoulder into him. \"Thank you.\"\n \"For the compliment? Or the f**king?\"\n \"Hush,\" I admonished, flushing.\n His dark velvet laugh turned every female head in hearing distance and some of the men\u0027s, too. Placing our linked hands at the small of my back, he pulled me close and smacked a kiss on my mouth.\n \"Gideon!\" His mother glided toward us with sparkling eyes and a wide smile on her lovely face. \"I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re here.\"\n She looked like she might hug him, but his posture altered subtly, charging the air around him with an invisible field of power that encompassed me as well.\n Elizabeth drew to an abrupt halt.\n \"Mother,\" he greeted her with all the warmth of an arctic storm. \"You can thank Eva for my being here. I\u0027ve come to take her away.\"\n \"But she\u0027s having a good time, aren\u0027t you, Eva? You should stay for her sake.\" Elizabeth looked at me with a plea in her eyes.\n My fingers flexed around Gideon\u0027s hand. He came first, that was never in question, but I couldn\u0027t help but wish I knew the story behind his coldness toward a mother who seemed to love him. Her adoring gaze slid over the face that had shades of her own, drinking in every feature hungrily. How long had it been since the last time she\u0027d seen him in person?\n Then I wondered if maybe she\u0027d loved him too much...\n Revulsion made my spine stiffen.\n \"Don\u0027t put Eva on the spot,\" Gideon said, rubbing his knuckles against my tense back. \"You\u0027ve gotten what you wanted - you\u0027ve met her.\"\n \"Perhaps you\u0027ll both come to dinner later this week?\"\n His only answer was an arched brow. Then his gaze lifted, luring my attention to follow it. I found Cary emerging from what appeared to be a hedgerow maze with a very recognizable pop princess on his arm. Gideon gestured him over.\n \"Oh, not Cary, too!\" Elizabeth protested. \"He\u0027s the life of the party.\"\n \"I thought you might like him.\" Gideon bared his teeth in something that was too sharp to be a smile. \"Just remember that he\u0027s Eva\u0027s friend, Mother. That makes him mine as well.\"\n I was hugely relieved when Cary joined us, breaking the tension in his easygoing way.\n \"I was looking for you,\" he said to me. \"I was hoping you\u0027d be ready to go. I got that call I was expecting.\"\n Looking into his sparkling eyes, I knew Trey had reached him. \"Yes, we\u0027re ready.\"\n Cary and I walked around to say our good-byes and offer our thanks. Gideon remained at my side like a possessive shadow, his demeanor calm but markedly aloof.\n We were all walking toward the house when I spotted Ireland off to the side staring at Gideon. I stopped and looked up at him. \"Go get your sister so we can say good-bye.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"She\u0027s standing to your left.\" I looked to our right to hide my prodding from the young girl whom I suspected might hero-worship her eldest brother.\n He gestured Ireland over with a brusque wave of his hand. She took her time ambling over, her pretty face schooled into an expression of militant boredom. I looked at Cary with a shake of my head, remembering those days all too well.\n \"Listen.\" I squeezed Gideon\u0027s wrist. \"Tell her you\u0027re sorry you two didn\u0027t get to catch up while you were here and she should call you sometime, if she wants.\"\n Gideon shot me an arch look. \"Catch up on what?\"\n Rubbing his biceps, I said, \"She\u0027ll do all the talking if given a chance.\"\n He scowled. \"She\u0027s a teenage girl. Why would I give her a chance to talk my ear off?\"\n I pushed onto my tiptoes and whispered in his ear, \"Because I\u0027ll owe you one.\"\n \"You\u0027re up to something.\" He eyed me warily for a moment; then pressed a hard kiss to my lips with a growl. \"So we\u0027ll leave it open and say you owe me more than one. Quantity to be determined.\"\n I nodded. Cary rocked back on his heels and twirled one index finger around another in a sign meaning wrapped around your finger.\n Only fair, I thought, since he was wrapped around my heart.\n I was surprised when Gideon accepted the keys to the Bentley SUV from one of the valets. \"You drove? Where\u0027s Angus?\"\n \"Day off.\" He nuzzled against my temple. \"I missed you, Eva.\"\n I settled into the front passenger seat, and he shut the door behind me. As I secured my seat belt, I saw him pause by the hood, making eye contact with two men dressed in black who waited beside a sleek black Mercedes sedan at the end of the drive. They nodded and got in the Benz. When Gideon pulled out of the Vidal driveway, they followed directly behind us.\n \"Security detail?\" I asked.\n \"Yes. I took off fast when I was told you were here, and they lost the tail for a while.\"\n Cary went home with Clancy, so Gideon and I headed straight to the penthouse. I found myself getting turned on from watching Gideon drive. He handled the luxury vehicle the way he handled everything - confidently, aggressively, and with skillful control. He drove fast but not recklessly, weaving easily over the curves and straightaways of the scenic route back to the city. There was almost no traffic until we hit the gridlock of Manhattan.\n When we arrived at his apartment, we both went straight into the master bathroom and undressed for a shower. As if he couldn\u0027t stop touching me, Gideon washed me from head to toe; then he dried me with a towel and wrapped me in a new robe of embroidered teal silk with kimono sleeves. He finished by pulling a pair of similarly hued drawstring silk pants out of a drawer for himself. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-71.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
