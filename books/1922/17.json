I lifted my head to look at him, and found him bright-eyed and biting his lip. \"Cary? What are you thinking?\" \"I\u0027m feeling kind of hot from that story.\" He laughed and the warm, richly masculine sound swept a lot of my irritation away. \"He\u0027s got to be so confused right now. I would\u0027ve paid money to see his face when you hit him with that bit he wanted to spank you over.\" \"I can\u0027t believe he said that.\" Just remembering Cross\u0027s voice when he made that threat had my palms damp enough to leave steam on my glass. \"What the hell is he into?\" \"Spanking\u0027s not deviant. Besides, he was going for missionary on the couch, so he\u0027s not averse to the basics.\" He fell into the couch, a brilliant smile lighting up his handsome face. \"You\u0027re a huge challenge to a guy who obviously thrives on them. And he\u0027s willing to make concessions to have you, which I\u0027d bet he\u0027s not used to. Just tell him what you want.\" I split the last of the wine between us, feeling marginally better with a bit of alcohol in my veins. What did I want? Aside from the obvious? \"We\u0027re totally incompatible.\" \"Is that what you call what happened on his couch?\" \"Cary, come on. Boil it down. He picked me up off the lobby floor, and then asked me to f**k. That\u0027s really it. Even a guy I take home from a bar has more going for him than that. Hey, what\u0027s your name? Come here often? Who\u0027s your friend? What are you drinking? Like to dance? Do you work around here?\" \"All right, all right. I get it.\" He set his glass down on the table. \"Let\u0027s go out. Hit a bar. Dance \u0027til we drop. Maybe meet some guys who\u0027ll talk you up some.\" \"Or at least buy me a drink.\" \"Hey, Cross offered you one of those in his office.\" I shook my head and stood. \"Whatever. Let me take a shower and we\u0027ll go.\" I threw myself into clubbing like it was going out of style. Cary and I bounced all over downtown clubs from Tribeca to the East Village, wasting stupid money on cover charges and having a fabulous time. I danced until my feet felt like they were going to fall off, but I toughed it out until Cary complained about his heeled boots first. We\u0027d just stumbled out of a techno-pop club with a plan to buy me flip-flops at a nearby Walgreens when we ran across a hawker promoting a lounge a few blocks away. \"Great place to get off your feet for a while,\" he said, without the usual flashy smile or exaggerated hype most of the hawkers employed. His clothes - black jeans and turtleneck - were more upscale, which intrigued me. And he didn\u0027t have fliers or postcards. What he handed me was a business card made from papyrus paper and printed with a gilded font that caught the light of the electric signage around us. I made a mental note to hang on to it as a great piece of print advertising. A stream of quickly moving pedestrians flowed around us. Cary squinted down at the lettering, having a few more drinks in him than I had. \"Looks swank.\" \"Show them that card,\" the hawker urged. \"You\u0027ll skip the cover.\" \"Sweet.\" Cary linked arms with me and dragged me along. \"Let\u0027s go. You might find a quality guy in a swanky joint.\" My feet were seriously killing me by the time we found the place, but I quit bitching when I saw the charming entrance. The line to get in was long, extending down the street and around the corner. Amy Winehouse\u0027s soulful voice drifted out of the open door, as did well-dressed customers who exited with big smiles. True to the hawker\u0027s word, the business card was a magic key that granted us immediate and free entrance. A gorgeous hostess led us upstairs to a quieter VIP bar that overlooked the stage and dance floor below. We were shown to a small seating area by the balcony and settled at a table hugged by two half-moon velvet sofas. She propped a beverage menu in the center and said, \"Your drinks are on the house. Enjoy your evening.\" \"Wow.\" Cary whistled. \"We scored.\" \"I think that hawker recognized you from an ad.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t that rock?\" He grinned. \"God, it\u0027s a great night. Hanging out with my best girl and crushing on a new hunk in my life.\" \"Oh?\" \"I think I\u0027ve decided to see where things go with Trey.\" That made me happy. It felt like I\u0027d been waiting forever for him to find someone who\u0027d treat him right. \"Has he asked you out yet?\" \"No, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s because he doesn\u0027t want to.\" He shrugged and smoothed his artfully ripped T-shirt. Paired with black leather pants and spiked wristlets, he looked sexy and wild. \"I just think he\u0027s trying to figure out the situation with you first. He wigged when I told him I lived with a woman and that I\u0027d moved across the country to be with you. He\u0027s worried I might be bi-curious and secretly hung up on you. That\u0027s why I wanted you two to meet today, so he could see how you and I are together.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Cary. I\u0027ll try to put him at ease about it.\" \"It\u0027s not your fault. Don\u0027t worry about it. It\u0027ll work out if it\u0027s supposed to.\" His assurances didn\u0027t make me feel better. I tried to think if there was a way I could help. Two guys stopped by our table. \"Okay if we join you?\" the taller one asked. I glanced at Cary, and then back at the guys. They looked like brothers and they were very attractive. Both were smiling and confident, their stances loose and easy. I was about to say, Sure, when a warm hand settled on my bare shoulder and squeezed firmly. \"This one\u0027s taken.\" Across from me, Cary gaped as Gideon Cross rounded the sofa and extended his hand to him. \"Taylor. Gideon Cross.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-17.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
