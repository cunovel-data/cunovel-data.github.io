He was pacing the length of my bathroom, his jacket shed somewhere and his shirt untucked. \"Go home, Gideon.\" He halted and shot me an incredulous look. \"I\u0027m not f**king leaving you here. Cary\u0027s lost his damned mind! That amped-up ass**le was seconds away from putting his hands on you when I got here.\" \"Cary wouldn\u0027t have let that happen. But either way, I can\u0027t deal with him and you at the same time.\" I didn\u0027t want to deal with either of them, actually. I just wanted to be alone. \"Then you\u0027ll just deal with me.\" I scooped my hair back from my face with an impatient swipe of my hand. \"Oh? I\u0027m supposed to make you the priority?\" He recoiled as if I\u0027d hit him. \"I was under the impression we were both each other\u0027s priorities.\" \"Yeah, I thought that, too. Until tonight.\" \"Jesus. Will you drop it with Corinne already?\" He spread his arms wide. \"I\u0027m here with you, aren\u0027t I? I barely said good-bye to her because I was chasing after you. Again.\" \"Fuck you. Don\u0027t do me any favors.\" Gideon lunged into the shower fully dressed. He yanked me to my feet and kissed me. Hard. His mouth devoured mine, his hands gripping my upper arms to hold me in place. But I didn\u0027t soften this time. I didn\u0027t give in. Even when he tried coaxing me with lush, suggestive licks. \"Why?\" he muttered, his lips sliding down to my throat. \"Why are you driving me insane?\" \"I don\u0027t know what your problem is with Dr. Lucas, and I honestly don\u0027t give a shit. But he was right. Corinne got way too much of your attention tonight. You pretty much ignored me during dinner.\" \"It\u0027s impossible for me to ignore you, Eva.\" His face was hard and tight. \"If you\u0027re in the same room with me, I don\u0027t see anyone else.\" \"Funny. Every time I looked at you, you were looking at her.\" \"This is stupid.\" He released me and shoved the wet hair out of his face. \"You know how I feel about you.\" \"Do I? You want me. You need me. But do you love Corinne?\" \"Oh, for f**k\u0027s sake. No.\" He shut the water off, caging me to the glass with both arms. \"You want me to tell you I love you, Eva? Is that what this is about?\" My stomach cramped as if he\u0027d struck me with the full force of his fist. I\u0027d never felt that kind of pain before, hadn\u0027t known it existed. My eyes burned and I ducked under his arm before I embarrassed myself by crying. \"Go home, Gideon. Please.\" \"I am home.\" He caught me from behind and buried his face in my soaked hair. \"I\u0027m with you.\" I struggled to get free, but I was too wiped out. Physically. Emotionally. The tears came in a torrent and I couldn\u0027t stop them. And I hated crying in front of anyone. \"Go away. Please.\" \"I love you, Eva. Of course I do.\" \"Oh my God.\" I kicked at him, flailing. Anything to get away from the person who\u0027d become a massive source of pain and misery. \"I don\u0027t want your f**king pity. I just want you to go away.\" \"I can\u0027t. You know I can\u0027t. Eva, stop fighting. Listen to me.\" \"Everything you\u0027re saying hurts, Gideon.\" \"It\u0027s not the right word, Eva,\" he pressed on stubbornly, his lips at my ear. \"That\u0027s why I haven\u0027t said it. It\u0027s not the right word for you and what I feel for you.\" \"Shut up. If you care about me at all, you\u0027ll just shut up and go away.\" \"I\u0027ve been loved before - by Corinne, by other women...But what the hell do they know about me? What the hell are they in love with when they don\u0027t know how f**ked up I am? If that\u0027s love, it\u0027s nothing compared to what I feel for you.\" I stilled, trembling, my gaze on the mirror\u0027s reflection of my mascara-smeared face and bedraggled wet hair next to Gideon\u0027s ravaged beauty. His features were overcome by volatile emotion as he wrapped himself tightly around me. We looked all wrong for each other. And yet I understood the alienation of being around others who couldn\u0027t really see you or chose not to. I\u0027d felt the self-loathing that came with being a fraud, portraying an image of what you wished you could be but weren\u0027t. I\u0027d lived with the fear that the people you loved might turn away from you if they ever got to know the true person hidden inside. \"Gideon - \" His lips touched my temple. \"I think I loved you the moment I saw you. Then we made love that first time in the limo and it became something else. Something more.\" \"Whatever. You cut me off that night and left me behind to take care of Corinne. How could you, Gideon?\" He released me only long enough to scoop me up and carry me over to where my bathrobe hung from a hook on the back of the door. He bundled me up; then had me sit on the edge of the tub while he went to the sink and pulled my makeup removal wipes out of the drawer. Crouching in front of me, he stroked the cloth over my cheek. \"When Corinne called during the advocacy dinner, it was the perfect time to make me do something stupid.\" His gaze was soft and warm on my tear-streaked face. \"You and I had just made love, and I wasn\u0027t thinking clearly. I told her I was busy and that I was with someone, and when I heard the pain in her voice, I knew I had to deal with her so I could move forward with you.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. You left me behind for her. How does that move us forward?\" \"I screwed up with Corinne, Eva.\" He tilted my chin back to rub at my raccoon eyes. \"I met her my first year at Columbia. I noticed her, of course. She\u0027s beautiful and sweet, and never had an unkind word to say about anyone. When she pursued me, I let myself be caught and she became my first consensual sexual experience.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-95.html","bookId":1922,"book":{"id":1922,"title":"Bared to You (Crossfire #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
