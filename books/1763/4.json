At first I think it’s part of my dream, but she persists, increasing in frequency and intensity until I say, “What?” “Why are you on the floor?” I can just make out her face and arm leaning over the mattress, tangle of hair coming over one shoulder. “You were kicking,” I say. “I’m sorry. Come back up. I promise I won’t anymore.” She makes room for me, and I cram in beside her. Her skin is sticky and hot. “You shouldn’t wear socks to bed,” I tell her. “They keep heat in. Last time you were pregnant, you always got feverish at night.” Her legs move under the blanket as she kicks her socks off. It takes her a while to get comfortable, and I can tell she’s trying not to disturb me, so I don’t complain as I’m knocked around the mattress. Eventually she settles on her side, facing me. “Did you get sick earlier, when you went to use the bathroom?” I ask. “Don’t tell Linden,” she says, yawning. “He’s squeamish about that stuff. He worries.” That’s to be expected after what happened with Rose’s pregnancy. But it’s not as though I can tell her that. And soon I find, despite my worries, that I’m exhausted enough to fall asleep. Just as I’m beginning to dream, she says, “I think about those other girls in the van with us. The ones who were killed.” My dreams fade away from me, and I wish desperately that they’d return. Even a nightmare would be welcome over that memory. It’s not something my sister wives and I ever talked about, the odd and horrific thing that bonded us to one another. I especially wouldn’t expect to hear about it from Cecily, who has always wanted to be the happy housewife. “I just wanted you to know that,” she says. “I’m not a monster.” I turn my head to look at her. “Of course you aren’t.” “You called me one,” she says. “The day you ran away.” “I was upset,” I say, pushing the sweaty hair from her face. “But what happened to Jenna isn’t your fault.” She draws a shaky breath, closes her eyes for a long moment. “Yes, it is.” Here is where I expect her to cry, but she doesn’t. She only looks at me. And it strikes me again how much she’s grown in my absence. Maybe she had no choice. There were no sister wives to console her, the father-in-law she trusted had only been using her, and it’s not as though she could explain any of this to her husband. I struggle for words of comfort, but nothing feels sincere enough. And no matter what I say, Jenna is still gone, and so are the other girls that were Gathered, and the girl Silas and I found lying in a ditch. Cecily still won’t live to see Bowen grow, and my brother has spiraled out of control in his grief, and I’m no closer to finding him than I was last year. I am entirely powerless. “The whole time we were married, I treated you like you were too small to understand what was happening to us,” I say. “But I felt small too. I couldn’t control the way things were any more than you could.” “You looked so confident,” she says. “I envied you from the day we were married. I’ve decided I’m going to be more like you.” She says it with conviction. “I’m going to be stronger.” The last thing I am is strong. “Get some sleep,” I whisper. “Rhine?” “What?” “I told Linden to believe you. I told him it’s true that Housemaster Vaughn is doing awful things downstairs.” I feel hope. Linden might not have any reason to believe me, but he’ll listen to Cecily. Even if it’s just to humor her so she doesn’t go hysterical on him. “You did?” “He wouldn’t listen at first,” she says. “It was while you were in the hospital. But I begged him to go and see for himself.” “Did he?” I ask. “Yes,” she says. “But—when he came back, he said there was nothing down there. A few of Housemaster Vaughn’s chemicals and things, lots of machines and attendants working on them, but no bodies. No Deirdre. He says you must have been hallucinating, or making it all up.” Hope swims away, leaving me with less than nothing. “But you saw those things too,” I press. “Did you tell him that?” Now she’s the one brushing her fingers through my hair, trying to console me. “I only saw what was happening to you,” she says. “I wish I’d seen more. I wish I’d seen Deirdre, or Rose’s domestic, what was her—” “Lydia,” I say. “Right. Lydia. I wish I could prove it.” She’s talking to me in that hushed, cooing tone usually reserved for her son. Trying to lull me to sleep, or compliance. And then I realize why. “You don’t believe me,” I say. “Oh, Rhine, Housemaster Vaughn did such terrible things to you. You were so delirious, and so sick. Maybe there’s a chance some of it—” “It was real,” I say, sitting up. “It was all real.” She sits upright herself, facing me in the darkness. She’s frowning. “There was nothing down there, Rhine.” “He hid them, then,” I say. “The bodies. The domestics. If Gabriel were here, he’d tell you the same thing.” Cecily straightens her posture, hopeful. She wants to believe me. “Did he tell you there were bodies down there?” “Not exactly,” I say. “What did he tell you?” My stomach sinks. I collapse back onto the pillow, defeated. “Not much,” I admit. He was so high on opiates at first, and then it was one problem after the next, really. “He didn’t have a chance.” Cecily lies beside me, rubs my arm reassuringly. We both go silent. I struggle to cope with the fact that I am the only one who saw what Vaughn kept in the basement. But even worse than that, I want to believe what Linden and Cecily do, that none of it really happened. Maybe it didn’t. Maybe Deirdre really did get sold to another house when I left, and Adair and Lydia too. Maybe they’re comfortable and safe, and I’d conjured Deirdre up to cope with the loneliness as I lay strapped to that bed. She visited me often. I start to make a list in my head of all the things I know. Vaughn killed Jenna; he admitted as much. Rose’s body was in the basement that day the elevators gave out. I saw her. I recognized her nail polish, her blond hair. There was a tracker in my leg. Deirdre told me about it. Didn’t she? I think of all the attendants who came to work on me while I was in the basement. In my memory they all have the same blank expressions; they’re all voiceless, uncaring. Deirdre was warm. She spoke gently, made me feel safe, which was a bizarre thing in that place. The list collapses in on itself, words and memories jumbling into a bloody mess. It’s so frustrating the way the pictures keep on changing. In the end it’s Cecily I reach for. At least I can be certain she exists. Her skin is sweaty and warm as I scrunch up the sleeves of the nightgown she borrowed from me. I worry about how overheated she gets, like there’s a fire inside her. I think she drifted off to sleep and I woke her, because she mumbles something nonsensical before opening her eyes. “You don’t have to believe me,” I tell her. “You just have to believe that Vaughn is capable of those things.” “I do,” she says. “Linden doesn’t. I think he chooses not to. He’s sensitive, you know?” She strokes my cheek with the side of her hand—a repetitive, wispy motion. Like little ghost kisses. “I thought Housemaster Vaughn wanted to do good things and save us all,” she says. “I was wrong. And admitting that meant admitting he won’t find an antidote and none of us has much time. You said you have to find your brother—so you should go do that. And Linden and I have Bowen, and this baby. I want to spend as much time with them as I can. I want to be with them until the end.” These are all things she wouldn’t have dared to say last year. But now she’s unflinching. Her voice doesn’t even catch when she adds, “If all those things you saw are real, there’s nothing we can do about them. We have our own lives to take care of, and there’s only time to do so much with them.” What she says is terrible and true. She grabs my hand. We squeeze each other’s fingers, and I wait for her to realize the magnitude of what she’s said. I wait for her to squish up against me and sob. But from the reason in her tone, I sense that those words have been in her for a long time. That while I was away, she had plenty of time to get used to them. And when the sob does come, several minutes later, it’s mine. My sister wife has already fallen asleep. I dream of Linden in the doorway. He looks at me a long while, the green in his eyes changing every second. “The stars do look like a kite,” he admits. “But everything else you’ve said is a lie.” In the morning I awaken to Cecily jumping from the bed, her feet crashing onto the floorboards like baritone notes, to get to the window. “Quiet,” I tell her, cringing at the sudden light when she yanks the window shade, forcing it to recoil with a slurping noise. “No, no, no. You have to hide,” she tells me. Panic in her eyes. The sound of an engine purring under the window. I stagger to my feet, every muscle sore, and walk to the window. And outside is the limo, a figure standing beside it waving us down. Linden said he’d be here to collect Cecily in the morning, but as my grogginess subsides, I realize that Linden isn’t here. Vaughn is. Chapter 3 “STAY HERE,” I say, hurrying to put on a pair of jeans under my nightgown. “Wait!” Cecily calls after me as I’m running down the stairs. “Stay!” I tell her. Outside, the early morning air is cold, and I hug my arms for warmth. Dewy grass clings to my bare feet as I move toward him. He smiles. “Ah, so she awakens,” he says. His voice disrupts the gray sky. A burst of blackbirds rushes past. I maintain my distance, keep my tone neutral when I ask, “Where’s Linden?” “Your husband had an early meeting with a potential contractor,” he says. “He sent me for you and Cecily.” “Sure he did,” I say, bracing one foot behind me to take a step back. “You’re still angry with me,” he says. “I understand. But, Rhine, darling, you’re such a fascinating creature. You should be flattered; before you came along, I was sure I’d seen everything. I couldn’t help but get carried away.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sever-the-chemical-garden-3/page-4.html","bookId":1763,"book":{"id":1763,"title":"Sever (The Chemical Garden #3)","description":"Storyline: Sever (The Chemical Garden #3) With the clock ticking until the virus takes its toll, Rhine is desperate for answers.
