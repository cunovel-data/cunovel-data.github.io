{"id":100310,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"The wizard held his hand out, fingers locked as if it were the talon of a great hunting bird. Sweat streaked his forehead despite the cold wind, and he locked his face into a mask of intensity.\n The stone was too heavy for him, but he kept up his telekinetic assault, willing it into the air. Down at the riverbank, dwarf masons on the far bank furiously cranked their come-alongs, while others rushed around the large stone, throwing an extra strap or chain where needed. Still, despite the muscle and ingenuity of the dwarf craftsmen, and magical aid from the Silverymoon wizard, the floating stone teetered on the brink of disaster.\n \"Joquim!\" another citizen of Silverymoon called.\n \"I...can\u0027t...hold...it,\" the wizard Joquim grunted back, each word forced out through gritted teeth.\n The second wizard shouted for help and rushed down to Joquim\u0027s side. He had little in the way of telekinetic prowess, but he had memorized a dweomer for just that eventuality. He launched into his spellcasting and threw his magical energies out toward the shaking stone. It stabilized, and when a third member of the Silverymoon contingent rushed over, the balance shifted in favor of the builders. It began to seem almost effortless as the combination of dwarf and wizard guided the stone out over the rushing waters of the River Surbrin.\n With a dwarf on the end of a beam guiding the way, the team with the come-alongs positioned the block perfectly over the even larger stones that had already been set in place. The guide dwarf called for a hold, rechecked the alignment, then lifted a red flag.\n The wizards eased up their magic gradually, slowly lowering the block.\n \"Go get the next one!\" the dwarf yelled to his companions and the wizards on the near bank. \"Seems the Lady\u0027s almost ready for this span!\"\n All eyes turned to the work at the near bank, the point closest to Mithral Hall, where Lady Alustriel stood on the first length of span over the river, her features serene as she whispered the words of a powerful spell of creation. Cold and strong she appeared, almost godlike above the rushing waters. Her white robes, highlighted in light green, blew about her tall and slender form. There was hardly a gasp of surprise when a second stone span appeared before her, reaching out to the next set of supports.\n Alustriel\u0027s arms slipped down to her sides and she gave a deep exhale, her shoulders slumping as if her effort had thrown out more than magical strength.\n \"Amazing,\" Catti-brie said, coming up beside her and inspecting the newly conjured slab.\n \"The Art, Catti-brie,\" Alustriel replied. \"Mystra\u0027s blessings are wondrous indeed.\" Alustriel turned a sly look her way. \"Perhaps I can tutor you.\"\n Catti-brie scoffed at the notion, but coincidentally, as she threw her head back, she twisted her leg at an angle that sent a wave of pain rolling through her damaged hip, and she was reminded that her days as a warrior might indeed be at their end - one way or another.\n \"Perhaps,\" she said.\n Alustriel\u0027s smile beamed genuine and warm. The Lady of Silvery moon glanced back and motioned to the dwarf masons, who flooded forward with their tubs of mortar to seal and smooth the newest span.\n \"The conjured stone is permanent?\" Catti-brie asked as she and Alustriel moved back down the ramp to the bank.\n Alustriel looked at her as if the question was completely absurd. \"Would you have it vanish beneath the wheels of a wagon?\"\n They both laughed at the flippant response.\n \"I mean, it is real stone,\" the younger woman clarified.\n \"Not an illusion, to be sure.\"\n \"But still the stuff of magic?\"\n Alustriel furrowed her brow as she considered the woman. \"The stone is as real as anything the dwarves could drag in from a quarry, and the dweomer that created it is permanent.\"\n \"Unless it is dispelled,\" Catti-brie replied, and Alustriel said, \"Ah,\" as she caught on to the woman\u0027s line of thought.\n \"It would take Elminster himself to even hope to dispel the work of Lady Alustriel,\" another nearby wizard interjected.\n Catti-brie looked from the mage to Alustriel.\n \"A bit of an exaggeration, of course,\" Alustriel admitted. \"But truly, any mage of sufficient power to dispel my creations would also have in his arsenal evocations that could easily destroy a bridge constructed without magic.\"\n \"But a conventional bridge can be warded against lightning bolts and other destructive evocations,\" Catti-brie reasoned.\n \"As this one shall be,\" promised Alustriel.\n \"And so it will be as safe as if the dwarves had...\" Catti-brie started, and Alustriel finished the thought with her, \"dragged the stones from a quarry.\"\n They shared another laugh, until Catti-brie added, \"Except from Alustriel.\"\n The Lady of Silverymoon stopped cold and turned to stare directly at Catti-brie.\n \"It is an easy feat for a wizard to dispel her own magic, so I am told,\" Catti-brie remarked. \"There will be no wards in place to prevent you from waving your hands and making expanse after expanse disappear.\"\n A wry grin crossed Alustriel\u0027s beautiful face, and she cocked an eyebrow, an expression of congratulations for the woman\u0027s sound and cunning reasoning.\n \"An added benefit should the orcs overrun this position and try to use the bridge to spread their darkness to other lands,\" Catti-brie went on.\n \"Other lands like Silverymoon,\" Alustriel admitted.\n \"Do not be quick to sever the bridge to Mithral Hall, Lady,\" Catti-brie said.\n \"Mithral Hall is connected to the eastern bank through tunnels in any case,\" Alustriel replied. \"We will not abandon your father, Catti-brie. We will never abandon King Bruenor and the valiant dwarves of Clan Battlehammer.\"\n Catti-brie\u0027s responding smile came easy to her, for she didn\u0027t doubt a word of the pledge. She glanced back at the conjured slabs and nodded appreciatively, both for the power in creating them and the strategy of Alustriel in keeping the power to easily destroy them.\n The late afternoon sun reflected moisture in Toogwik Tuk\u0027s jaundiced brown eyes, for he could hardly contain his tears of joy at the ferocious reminder of what it was to be an orc. Grguch\u0027s march through the three remaining villages had been predictably successful, and after Toogwik Tuk had delivered his perfected sermon, every able-bodied orc warrior of those villages had eagerly marched out in Grguch\u0027s wake. That alone would have garnered the fierce chieftain of Clan Karuck another two hundred soldiers.\n But more impressively, they soon enough discovered, came the reinforcements from villages through which they had not passed. Word of Grguch\u0027s march had spread across the region directly north of Mithral Hall, and the war-thirsty orcs of many tribes, frustrated by the winter pause, had rushed to the call.\n As he crossed the impromptu encampment, Toogwik Tuk surveyed the scores - no, hundreds - of new recruits. Grguch would hit the dwarven fortifications with closer to two thousand orcs than one thousand, by the shaman\u0027s estimation. Victory at the Surbrin was all but assured. Could King Obould hope to hold back the tide of war after that?\n Toogwik Tuk shook his head with honest disappointment as he considered the once-great leader. Something had happened to Obould. The shaman wondered if it might have been the stinging defeat Bruenor\u0027s dwarves had handed him in his ill-fated attempt to breach Mithral Hall\u0027s western door. Or had it been the loss of the conspiring dark elves and Gerti Orelsdottr and her frost giant minions? Or perhaps it had come about because of the loss of his son, Urlgen, in the fight on the cliff tops north of Keeper\u0027s Dale.\n Whatever the cause, Obould hardly seemed the same fierce warrior who had led the charge into Citadel Adbar, or who had begun his great sweep south from the Spine of the World only a few months before. Obould had lost his understanding of the essence of the orc. He had lost the voice of Gruumsh within his heart.\n \"He demands that we wait,\" the shaman mused aloud, staring out at the teeming swarm, \"and yet they come by the score to the promise of renewed battle with the cursed dwarves.\"\n Never more certain of the righteousness of his conspiracy, the shaman moved quickly toward Grguch\u0027s tent. Obould no longer heard the call of Gruumsh, but Grguch surely did, and after the dwarves were smashed and chased back into their holes, how might King Obould claim dominion over the chieftain of Clan Karuck? And how might Obould secure fealty from the tens of thousands of orcs he had brought forth from their holes with promises of conquest?\n Obould demanded they sit and wait, that they till the ground like peasant human farmers. Grguch demanded of them that they sharpen their spears and swords to better cut the flesh of dwarves.\n Grguch heard the call of Gruumsh.\n The shaman found the chieftain standing on the far side of a small table, surrounded by two of his Karuck warlords and with a much smaller orc standing across from them and manipulating a pile of dirt and stones that had been set upon the table. As he neared, Toogwik Tuk recognized the terrain being described by the smaller orc, for he had seen the mountain ridge that stretched from the eastern end of Mithral Hall down to the Surbrin.\n \"Welcome, Gruumsh-speaker,\" Grguch greeted him. \"Join us.\"\n Toogwik Tuk moved to an open side of the table and inspected the scout\u0027s work, which depicted a wall nearly completed to the Surbrin and a series of towers anchoring it.\n \"The dwarves have been industrious throughout the winter,\" said Grguch. \"As you feared. King Obould\u0027s pause has given them strength.\"\n \"They will anticipate an attack like ours,\" the shaman remarked.\n \"They have witnessed no large movements of forces to indicate it,\" said Grguch.\n \"Other than our own,\" Toogwik Tuk had to remind him.\n But Grguch laughed it off. \"Possibly they have taken note of many orcs now moving nearer to their position,\" he agreed. \"They may expect an attack in the coming tendays.\"\n The two Karuck warlords beside the brutish chieftain chuckled at that.\n \"They will never expect one this very night,\" said Grguch.\n Toogwik Tuk\u0027s face dropped into a sudden frown, and he looked down at the battlefield in near panic. \"We have not even sorted out our forces...\" he started to weakly protest.\n \"There is nothing to sort,\" Grguch replied. \"Our tactic is swarm fodder and nothing more.\"\n \"Swarm fodder?\" asked the shaman.\n \"A simple swarm to and through the wall,\" said Grguch. \"Darkness is our ally. Speed and surprise are our allies. We will hit them as a wave flattens the ridge of a boot print on a beach.\"\n \"You know not the techniques of the many tribes who have come into the fold.\"\n \"I don\u0027t need to,\" Grguch declared. \"I don\u0027t need to count my warriors. I don\u0027t need to place them in lines and squares, to form reserves and ensure that our flanks are protected back far enough to prevent an end run by our enemies. That is the way of the dwarf.\" He paused and looked around at the stupidly grinning warlords and the excited scout. \"I see no dwarves in this room,\" he said, and the others laughed.\n Grguch looked back at Toogwik Tuk. His eyes went wide, as if in alarm, and he sniffed at the air a couple of times. \"No,\" he declared, looking again to his warlords. \"I smell no dwarves in this room.\"\n The laughter that followed was much more pronounced, and despite his reservations, Toogwik Tuk was wise enough to join in.\n \"Tactics are for dwarves,\" the chieftain explained. \"Discipline is for elves. For orcs, there is only...\" He looked directly at Toogwik Tuk.\n \"Swarm fodder?\" the shaman asked, and a wry grin spread on Grguch\u0027s ugly face.\n \"Chaos,\" he confirmed. \"Ferocity. Bloodlust and abandon. As soon as the sun has set, we begin our run. All the way to the wall. All the way to the Surbrin. All the way to the eastern doors of Mithral Hall. Half, perhaps more than half, of our warriors will find tonight the reward of glorious death.\"\n Toogwik Tuk winced at that, and silently berated himself. Was he beginning to think more like Obould?\n Grguch reminded him of the words of Gruumsh One-eye. \"They will die with joy,\" the chieftain promised. \"Their last cry will be of elation and not agony. And any who die otherwise, with regret or with sorrow or with fear, should have been slaughtered in sacrifice to Gruumsh before our attack commenced!\"\n The sudden volume and ferocity of his last proclamation set Toogwik Tuk back on his heels and had both the Clan Karuck warlords and guards at the perimeter of the room growling and gnashing their teeth. For a brief moment, Toogwik Tuk almost reconsidered his call to the deepest holes to rouse Chieftain Grguch.\n Almost.\n \"There has been no sign from the dwarves that they know of our march,\" Grguch told a great gathering later that day, when the sunlight began to wane. Toogwik Tuk noted the dangerous priest Hakuun standing at his side, and that gave the younger shaman pause. He got the feeling that Hakuun had been watching him all along.\n \"They do not see the doom that has come against them,\" Grguch ordered. \"Do not shout out, but run. Run fast to the wall, without delay, and whispering praise for Gruumsh with every stride.\"\n There were no lines or coordinated movements, just a wild charge begun miles from the goal. There were no torches to light the way, no magical lights conjured by Toogwik Tuk or the other priests of Gruumsh. They were orcs, after all, raised in the upper tunnels of the lightless Underdark.\n The night was their ally, the dark their comfort.\n Once, when he was a child, Hralien had found a large pile of sand down by one of the Moonwood\u0027s two lakes. From a distance, that mound of light-colored sand had seemed discolored with streaks of red, and as he moved closer, young Hralien realized that the streaks weren\u0027t discolored sand, but were actually moving upon the surface of the mound. Being young and inexperienced, he had at first feared that he had happened upon a tiny volcano, perhaps.\n On closer inspection, though, the truth had come clear to him, for the pile of sand had been an ant mound, and the red streaks were lines of the six-legged creatures marching to and fro.\n Hralien thought of that long-ago experience as he witnessed the charge of the orcs, swarming the small, rocky hills north of King Bruenor\u0027s eastern defenses. Their movements seemed no less frenetic, and truly their march appeared no less determined. Given their speed and intensity, and the obstacle that awaited them barely two miles to the south, Hralien recognized their intent.\n The elf bit his lip as he remembered his promise to Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. He looked south, sorting out the landscape and recalling the trails that would most quickly return him to Mithral Hall.\n Then he was running, and fearing that he could not keep his promise to his drow friend, for the orc line stretched ahead of him and the creatures had not far to travel. With great grace and agility, Hralien sprang from stone to stone. He leaped up and grabbed a low tree branch and swung out across a narrow chasm, landing lightly on the other side and in a full run. He moved with hardly a whisper of sound, unlike the orcs, whose heavy steps echoed in his keen elf\u0027s ears.\n He knew that he should be cautious, for he could ill afford the delay if he happened into a fight. But neither could he slow his run and carefully pick his path, for some of the orcs were ahead of him, and the dwarves would need every heartbeat of warning he could give them. So he ran on, leaping and scrambling over bluffs and through low dales, where the melting snow had streamed down and pooled in clear, cold pockets. Hralien tried to avoid those pools as much as possible, for they often concealed slick ice. But even with his great dexterity and sharp vision, he occasionally splashed through, cringing at the unavoidable sound.\n At one point, he heard an orc cry out, and feared that he had been spotted. Many strides later, he realized that the creature was just calling to a companion, a stark reminder that the lead runners and scouts of the brutish force were all around him.\n Finally he left the sounds of orcs behind, for though the brutes could move with great speed, they could not match the pace of a dexterous elf, even across such broken ground.\n Soon after, coming up over a rocky rise, Hralien caught sight of squat stone towers in the south, running down from tall mountains to the silvery, moonlit snake that was the River Surbrin.\n \"Too soon,\" the elf whispered in dismay, and he glanced back as if expecting Obould\u0027s entire army to roll over him. He shook his head and winced, then sprinted off for the south.\n \"We will have it completed within the tenday,\" Alustriel said to Catti-brie, the two sitting with some of the other Silverymoon wizards around a small campfire. One of the wizards, a robust human with thick salt and pepper hair and a tightly trimmed goatee, had conjured the flames and was playing with them, casting cantrips to change their color from orange to white to blue and red. A second wizard, a rather eccentric half-elf with shiny black hair magically streaked by a bloom of bright red locks, joined in and wove enchantments to make the red flames form into the shape of a small dragon. Seeing the challenge, the first wizard likewise formed blue flames, and the two spellcasters set their fiery pets into a proxy battle. Almost immediately, several other wizards began excitedly placing their bets.\n Catti-brie watched with amusement and interest - more than she would have expected, and Alustriel\u0027s words to her about dabbling in the dark arts flitted unbidden through her thoughts. Her experience with wizards was very limited, and mostly involved the unpredictable and dangerously foolish Harpell family from Longsaddle.\n \"Asa Havel will win,\" Alustriel whispered to her, leaning in close and indicating the half-elf wizard who had manipulated the red flame. \"Duzberyl is far more powerful at manipulating fire, but he has taxed his powers to their limit this day conjuring bright hot flames to seal the stone. And Asa Havel knows it.\"\n \"So he challenged,\" Catti-brie whispered back. \"And his friends know, too, so they wager.\"\n \"They would wager anyway,\" Alustriel explained. \"It is a matter of pride. Whatever is lost here will be reclaimed soon enough in another challenge.\"\n Catti-brie nodded and watched the unfolding drama, the many faces, elf and human alike, glowing in varying shades and hues in the uneven light, turning blue as the blue dragon leaped atop the red, but then drifting back, green and yellow and toward a feverish red as Asa Havel\u0027s drake filtered up through Duzberyl\u0027s and gradually gained supremacy. It was all good-natured, of course, but Catti-brie didn\u0027t miss the intensity etched onto the faces of the combatants and onlookers alike. It occurred to her that she was looking into an entirely different world. She could relate it to the drinking games, and the arm-wrestling and sparring that so often took place in the taverns of Mithral Hall, for though the venue was different, the emotions were not. Still, there remained enough of a difference to intrigue her. It was a battle of strength, but of mental strength and concentration, and not of muscle and intestinal fortitude.\n \"Within a month, you could form flames into such shapes, yourself,\" Alustriel teased.\n Catti-brie looked at her and laughed dismissively, but that hardly hid her interest.\n She looked back to the fire just in time to see Duzberyl\u0027s blue roll over and consume Asa Havel\u0027s red, contrary to Alustriel\u0027s prediction. The backers of both wizards gasped in surprise and Duzberyl gave a yelp that was more shock than of victory. Catti-brie\u0027s gaze turned to Asa Havel, and her surprise turned to confusion.\n The half-elf was not looking at the fight, and seemed oblivious to the fact that his dragon had been consumed by the human\u0027s blue. He stared out to the north, his sea-blue eyes scanning high above the flames. Catti-brie felt Alustriel turn beside her, then stand. The woman glanced over her shoulder, up at the dark wall, but shook her head slightly in confusion, seeing nothing out of the ordinary. Beside her, Alustriel cast a minor spell.\n Other wizards rose and peered out to the north.\n \"An elf has come,\" Alustriel said to Catti-brie. \"And the dwarves are scrambling.\"\n \"It\u0027s an attack,\" Asa Havel announced, rising and moving past the two women. He looked right at Alustriel and the princess of Mithral Hall and asked, \"Orcs?\"\n \"Prepare for battle,\" Alustriel said to her contingent. \"Area spells to disrupt any charge.\"\n \"We have little left this day,\" Duzberyl reminded her.\n In response, Alustriel reached inside one of the folds of her robes and drew forth a pair of slender wands. She half-turned and tossed one to Duzberyl. \"Your necklace, too, if needed,\" she instructed, and the human nodded and brought a hand to a gaudy choker he wore, its golden links set with large stones like rubies of varying sizes, including one so large that Catti-brie couldn\u0027t have closed her fist around it.\n \"Talindra, to the gates of the dwarven halls,\" Alustriel said to a young elf female. \"Warn the dwarves and help them sort the battle.\"\n The elf nodded and took a few fast steps to the west, then disappeared with a flash of blue-white light. A second flash followed almost instantly, over near the hall\u0027s eastern gates, transporting Talindra to her assigned position, the surprised Catti-brie assumed, for she couldn\u0027t actually see the young elf.\n She turned back to hear Alustriel positioning Asa Havel and another pair. \"Secure fast passage to the far bank, should we need it. Prepare enough to carry any dwarves routed from the wall.\"\n Catti-brie heard the first shouts from the wall, followed by the blare of horns, many horns, from beyond to the north. Then came the blare of one that overwhelmed all the others, a resonating, low-pitched grumble that shook the stones beneath Catti-brie\u0027s feet.\n \"Damn Obould to the Nine Hells,\" Catti-brie whispered, and she grimaced at the realization that she had loaned Taulmaril to Drizzt. She looked over at Alustriel. \"I haven\u0027t my bow, or a sword. A weapon, please? Conjure one or produce one from a deep pocket.\"\n To Catti-brie\u0027s surprise, the Lady of Silverymoon did just that, pulling yet another wand from inside her robes. Catti-brie took it, not knowing what to make of the thing, and when she looked back at Alustriel, the tall woman was tugging a ring from her finger.\n \"And this,\" she said, handing over the thin gold band set with a trio of sparkling diamonds. \"I trust you are not already in the possession of two magical rings.\"\n Catti-brie took it and held it pressed between her thumb and index finger, her expression dumbfounded.\n \"The command word for the wand is \u0027twell-in-sey,\u0027\" Alustriel explained. \"Or \u0027twell-in-sey-sey\u0027 if you wish to loose two magical bolts.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know...\"\n \"Anyone can use it,\" Alustriel assured her. \"Point it at your target and speak the word. For the bigger orcs, choose two.\"\n \"But...\"\n \"Put the ring on your finger and open your mind to it, for it will impart to you its dweomers. And know that they are powerful indeed.\" With that, Alustriel turned away, and Catti-brie understood that the lesson was at its end.\n The Lady of Silverymoon and her wizards, except for those working near the river preparing a magical escape to the far bank, headed off for the wall, nearly all of them drawing forth wands or rods, or switching rings and other jewelry. Catti-brie watched it all with an undeniable sense of excitement, so much so that she was trembling so badly she could hardly line up the ring to slip it on her finger.\n Finally she did, and she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She felt as if she were looking up at the heavens, to see stars shooting across the darkened night sky, to see flashes of brilliance so magnificent that it seemed to her as if the gods must be throwing bolts at each other.\n The first sounds of battle shook her from her contemplation. She opened her eyes and nearly fell over due to dizziness from the sudden change, as if she had just stepped back to solid ground from the Astral Plane.\n She started after Alustriel, inspecting the wand, and garnered quickly which end to hold from a leather strap wrapped diagonally as a hand grip. At least she hoped it was the right end, and she winced at the thought of unloading enchanted bolts of magic into her own face. She dismissed the worry, noting that she wasn\u0027t gaining much on Alustriel, and noting more pointedly that the dwarves at the wall scrambled and yelled for support in many places already. She dropped her arms down beside her and ran as fast as her battered hip would allow.\n \"Twell-in-sey,\" she whispered, trying to get the inflection correct.\n She did.\n The wand discharged and a red dart of energy burst forth, snapping into the ground with a hiss right before her running feet. Catti-brie yelped and stumbled, nearly falling over. She caught her balance and her composure, and was glad that no one seemed to notice.\n On she ran, or tried to, but a wave of hot fire ran up her leg and nearly toppled her yet again. She looked down to her boot, smoking and charred on the side just back of her little toe. She paused again and composed herself, taking heart that the wound was not too severe, and thanking Moradin himself that Lady Alustriel hadn\u0027t given her a wand of lightning bolts.\n The orc gained the wall in a wild rush, stabbing powerfully at the nearest dwarf, who seemed an easy kill as he was busy driving a second orc back over the wall and into the darkness.\n But that dwarf, Charmorffe Dredgewelder of Fine Family Yellow-beard - so named because none of the Dredgewelders was ever known to have a yellow beard - was neither particularly surprised nor particularly impressed by the aggressive move. Trained under Thibble dorf Pwent himself, having served more than a score of years in the Gutbuster Brigade, Charmorffe had faced many a finer foe than that pathetic creature.\n As Charmorffe had never gotten familiar with a formal buckler, his plate-shielded arm swooped down to intercept the spear, blocking it solidly and sweeping it back behind him as he turned. That same movement brought his cudgel swinging around, and a quick three-step forward caught the overbalanced orc cleanly in range. The creature grunted, as did the dwarf, as the cudgel slammed it right behind the shoulder, launching it into a dive and spin forward, right off the ten-foot parapet.\n As the path before him cleared, Charmorffe looked down the tip of an arrow set on a short bow. He yelped and fell over backward, buckling at both his knees, and as soon as he was clear, Hralien let fly. The missile hummed through the air right above the dwarf, and splattered into the chest of an orc that had been sneaking up on him from behind.\n As soon as his back hit the stone, Charmorffe snapped all of his muscles forward, throwing his arms up high, and brought himself right back to his feet.\n \"That\u0027s twice I\u0027m owin\u0027 ye, ye durned elf!\" the dwarf protested. \"First for savin\u0027 us all, and now for savin\u0027 meself!\"\n \"I did neither, good dwarf,\" Hralien replied, running across the parapet to the waist-high wall, where he set his bow to work immediately. \"I\u0027ve faith that Clan Battlehammer is more than able to save itself.\"\n He shot off an arrow as he spoke, but as soon as he finished, a large orc rose into the air right before him, sword ready to strike a killing blow. The orc landed lightly on the wall top and struck, but a spinning cudgel hit both the sword and the orc, turning its blow harmlessly short. And when the orc managed to hold its balance and throw itself forward at Hralien, it too was intercepted, by a flying Charmorffe Dredgewelder. The dwarf connected with a shoulder block, driving the orc tight against the wall. The orc began raining ineffective blows upon the dwarf\u0027s back for Charmorffe\u0027s powerful legs kept grinding, pressing in even tighter.\n Hralien stabbed the orc in the eye with an arrow.\n The elf jumped back fast, though, set the arrow and let fly, point blank into yet another orc flying up to the top of the wall. Hralien hit it squarely, and though its feet landed atop the narrow rail, the jolt of the hit dropped it right back off.\n Charmorffe leaped up and clean-and-jerked the thrashing orc up high over his head. The dwarf threw himself into the wall, which hit him about mid chest, and snapped forward, tossing the orc over. As he went forward, Charmorffe solved the riddle, for just below him, and off to both sides as well, stood ogres, their backs tight against the wall. As each bent low and cupped its hands down near the ground, another orc ran up and stepped into that brace. A slight toss by the ogres had orcs sailing up over the wall.\n \"Pig-faced goblin kissers,\" Charmorffe growled. He turned and shouted, \"Rocks over the wall, boys! We got ogres playing as ladders!\"\n Hralien rushed up beside Charmorffe, leaned far out and shot an arrow into the top of the nearest ogre\u0027s head. He marveled at his handiwork, then saw it all the more clearly as a fireball lit up the night, down to the east of his position, closer to the Surbrin where the wall was far from complete.\n When Hralien looked that way, he thought their position surely lost, for though Alustriel and her wizards had entered the fray, a mass of huge orcs and larger foes swarmed across the defenses.\n \"Run for Mithral Hall, good dwarf,\" the elf said.\n \"That\u0027s what I be thinking,\" said Charmorffe.\n Duzberyl ambled toward the wall, grumbling incessantly. \"Two hundred pieces of gold for this one alone,\" he muttered, pulling another glittering red jewel from his enchanted necklace. He reached back and threw it at the nearest orcs, but his estimate of distance in the low light was off and the jewel landed short of the mark. Its fiery explosion still managed to engulf and destroy a couple of the creatures, and the others fell back in full flight, shrieking with every stride.\n But Duzberyl griped all the more. \"A hundred gold an orc,\" he grumbled, glancing back at Alustriel, who was far off to the side. \"I could hire an army of rangers to kill ten times the number for one-tenth the cost!\" he said, though he knew she was too far away to hear him.\n And she wasn\u0027t listening anyway. She stood perfectly still, the wind whipping her robes. She lifted one arm before her, a jeweled ring on her clenched fist sparking with multicolored light.\n Duzberyl had seen that effect before, but still he was startled when a bolt of bright white lightning burst forth from Alustriel\u0027s ring, splitting the night. The powerful wizard\u0027s aim was, as always, right on target, her bolt slamming an ogre in the face as it climbed over the wall. Hair dancing wildly, head smoking, the brute flew back into the darkness as Alustriel\u0027s bolt bounced away to hit another nearby attacker, an orc that seemed to simply melt into the stone. Again and again, Alustriel\u0027s chain lightning leaped away, striking orc or ogre or half-ogre, sending foes flying or spinning down with smoke rising from bubbling skin.\n But every vacancy was fast-filled, ten attackers for every one that fell, it seemed.\n The apparent futility brought a renewed growl to Duzberyl\u0027s chubby face, and he stomped along to a better vantage point.\n Limping from foot and hip, Catti-brie watched it all with equal if not greater frustration, for at least Alustriel and her wizards were equipped to battle the monsters. The woman felt naked without her bow, and even with the gifts Alustriel had offered, she believed that she would prove more a burden than an asset.\n She considered removing herself from the front lines, back to the bridge where she might prove of some use to Asa Havel in directing the retreat, should it come to that. That in mind, she glanced back - and noted a small group of orcs sprinting along the riverbank toward the distracted wizards.\n Catti-brie thrust forth the wand, but brought it back and punched out with her other fist instead. The ring\u0027s teeming magical energies called out to her and she listened, and though she didn\u0027t know exactly the effects of her call, she followed the magical path toward the strongest sensation of stored energy.\n The ring jolted once, twice, thrice, each burst sending forth a fiery ball at Catti-brie\u0027s targets. Like twinkling little stars, they seemed, as if the ring had reached up to the heavens and pulled celestial bodies down for its wielder to launch at her enemies. At great speed, they shot out across the night, leaving fiery trails, and when they reached the orc group, they exploded into larger blasts of consuming flames.\n Orcs shrieked and scrambled frantically, and more than one leaped into the river to be washed away by cold, killing currents. Others rolled on the ground, trying to douse the biting flames, and when that failed, they ran off like living torches into the dark night, only to fall a few steps away, to crumble and burn on the frozen ground.\n It lasted only a heartbeat, but seemed like much longer to Catti-brie, who stood transfixed, breathing hard, her eyes wide with shock. With a thought, she had blown apart nearly a score of orcs. As if they were nothing. As if she were a goddess, passing judgment on insignificant creatures. Never had she felt such power!\n At that moment, if someone had asked Catti-brie the Elvish name of her treasured longbow, she would not have recalled it.\n \"It\u0027s not to hold!\" Charmorffe cried to Hralien, and a swipe of the dwarf\u0027s heavy cudgel sent another orc flying aside.\n Hralien wanted to shout back words of encouragement, but his view of the battlefield, since he wielded a weapon that made it incumbent upon him to seek a wider perspective, was more complete, and he understood that the situation was even worse than Charmorffe likely believed.\n Few dwarves came forth from Mithral Hall and a host of orcs poured through the lower, uncompleted sections of the defensive wall. Huge orcs, some two feet taller and more than a hundred pounds heavier than the dwarves. Among them were true ogres, though it was hard for Hralien to distinguish where some of the orcs ended and the clusters of ogres began.\n More orcs came up over the wall, launched by their ogre step-stools, putting pressure on the dwarves and preventing them from organizing a coordinated defense against the larger mass rolling in from the east.\n \"It\u0027s not to hold!\" Charmorffe yelled again, and the words rang true. Hralien knew that the end was coming fast. The wizards intervened - one fireball then another, and a lightning chain that left many creatures smoking on the ground. But that wouldn\u0027t be enough, and Hralien understood that the wizards had been at their magical work all day long and had little power left to offer.\n \"Start the retreat,\" the elf said to Charmorffe. \"To Mithral Hall!\"\n Even as he spoke, the orc mass surged forward, and Hralien feared that he and Charmorffe and the others had waited too long.\n \"By the gods, and the gemstone vendors!\" Duzberyl roared, watching the sudden break in the dwarven line, the bearded folk sprinting back to the west along the wall, leaping down from the parapets and veering straight for Mithral Hall\u0027s eastern door. All semblance of a defensive posture had flown, creating a full and frantic retreat.\n And it wouldn\u0027t be enough, the wizard calculated, for the orcs, hungry for dwarf blood, closed with every stride. Duzberyl grimaced as a dwarf was swallowed in the black cloud of the orc horde.\n The portly wizard ran, and he reached up to his necklace, grasping the largest stone of all. He tore it free, cursed the gemstone merchant again for good measure, and heaved it with all his strength.\n The magical grenade hit the base of the wall just behind the leading orcs, and exploded, filling the area, even up onto the parapet, with biting, killing fires. Those monsters immediately above and near the blast charred and died, while others scrambled in an agonized and horrified frenzy, flames consuming them as they ran. Panic hit the orc line, and the dwarves ran free.\n \"Mage,\" Grguch muttered as he alighted on the wall some distance back of the enormous fireball.\n \"Of considerable power,\" said Hakuun, who stood beside him, having blessed himself and Grguch with every conceivable ward and enhancement.\n The chieftain turned back and fell prone on the parapet railing. \"Hand it up,\" he called down to the ogre who had flipped him up, indicating a weapon. A moment later, Grguch stood again on the wall, hoisting on one shoulder a huge javelin at the end of an atlatl.\n \"Mage,\" Grguch grumbled again with obvious disgust.\n Hakuun held up a hand, motioning for the chieftain to pause. Then, from inside the orc priest, Jack the Gnome cast a most devious enchantment on the head of the missile.\n Grguch grinned and brought his shoulder back, shifting the angle of the ten-foot missile. As Hakuun cast a second, complimentary spell upon the intended victim, Grguch launched the spear with all his might.\n The stubborn orc lurched toward her, one of its legs still showing flashes of biting flame.\n Catti-brie didn\u0027t flinch, didn\u0027t even start as the orc awkwardly threw a spear her way. She kept her eyes locked on the creature, met its gaze and its hate, and slowly lifted her wand.\n She wished at that moment that she had Khazid\u0027hea at her side, that she could engage the vile creature in personal combat. The orc took another staggering step, and Catti-brie uttered the command word.\n The red missile sizzled into the orc\u0027s chest, knocking it backward. Somehow it held its balance and even advanced another step. Catti-brie said the last word of the trigger twice, as she had been schooled, and the first red missile knocked the orc back yet again, and the second dropped it to the ground where it writhed for just a heartbeat before laying very still.\n Catti-brie stood calm and motionless for a few moments, steadying herself. She turned back to the wall, and blinked against the bursts of fiery explosions and the sharp cuts of lightning bolts, a fury that truly left her breathless. In her temporary blindness, she almost expected that the battle had ended, that the wizardly barrage had utterly destroyed the attackers as she had laid low the small group by the river.\n But there came the largest blast of all, a tremendous fireball some distance back along the wall to the west, toward Mithral Hall. Catti-brie saw the truth of it, saw the dwarves, and one elf, in desperate retreat, saw all semblance of defense stripped from the wall, buried under the trampling boots of a charging orc horde.\n The wall was lost. All from Mithral Hall to the Surbrin was lost. Even Lady Alustriel was withdrawing, not quite in full flight, but in a determined retreat.\n Looking past Alustriel, Catti-brie noted Duzberyl. For a moment, she wondered why he, too, was not in retreat, until she realized that he stood strangely, leaning too far back for his legs to support him, his arms lolling limply at his sides.\n One of the other wizards threw a lightning bolt - a rather feeble one - and in the flash, Catti-brie saw the huge javelin that had been driven half of its ten-foot length through his chest, its tip buried into the ground, pinning the wizard in that curious, angular stance.\n \"We have them routed! Now is the moment of victory!\" a frustrated Hakuun said as he stood alone behind the charging horde. He wanted to go with them, or to serve as Jaculi\u0027s conduit, as he often had, to launch a barrage of devastating magic.\n But Jaculi would not begin that barrage, and worse, the uninvited parasite interrupted him every time he tried to use his more conventional shaman\u0027s magic.\n A temporary moment, to be sure, Jack said in his thoughts.\n \"What foolishness...?\"\n That is Lady Alustriel, Jack explained. Alustriel of the Seven Sisters. Do not draw her attention!\n \"She is running!\" Hakuun protested.\n She will know me. She will recognize me. She will turn loose her army and all of her wizards and all of her magic to destroy me, Jack explained. It is an old grudge, but one that neither I nor she has forgotten! Do nothing to draw her attention.\n \"She is running! We can kill her,\" said Hakuun.\n Jack\u0027s incredulous laughter filled his head with dizzying volume, so much so that the shaman couldn\u0027t even start off after Grguch and the others. He just stood there, swaying, as the battle ended around him.\n Inside Hakuun\u0027s head, Jack the brain mole breathed a lot easier. In truth, he had no idea if Alustriel remembered the slight he had given her more than a century earlier. But he surely remembered her wrath from that dangerous day, and it was nothing that Jack the Gnome ever wanted to see again.\n One of Lady Alustriel\u0027s wizards ran past Catti-brie at that moment, shouting, \"Be quick to the bridge!\"\n Catti-brie shook her head, but she knew it to be a futile denial. Mithral Hall hadn\u0027t expected an assault of such ferocity so soon. They had been lulled by a winter of inaction, by the many reports that the bulk of the orc army remained in the west, near to Keeper\u0027s Dale, and by the widespread rumors that King Obould had settled in place, satisfied with his gains.\n \"To the Nine Hells with you, Obould,\" she cursed under her breath. \"I pray that Drizzt won\u0027t kill you, only that I may find the pleasure myself.\"\n She turned and started for the bridge with as much speed as she could muster, stepping awkwardly, as each time she brought her right foot forward, she felt the pangs from her damaged hip, and each time she placed that foot onto the ground, she was reminded by a burning sting of her foolishness with the magical wand.\n When another wizard running by skidded to a stop beside her and offered her shoulder, Catti-brie, for all her pride and all her determination to not be a burden, gratefully accepted. If she had refused a hand, she would have fallen to the back of the line and likely would have never made it to the bridge.\n Asa Havel greeted the returning contingent, directing them to floating disks of glowing magic that hovered nearby. As each seat filled, the wizard who had created it climbed aboard, but for a few moments, none started out across the river, for none wanted to leave the fleeing dwarves.\n \"Be gone!\" Alustriel ordered them, coming in at the end of the line and with orc pursuit not far behind. \"Because of Duzberyl\u0027s sacrifice, the retreating dwarves will make the safety of the hall, and I have sent a whisper on the wind to Talindra to instruct them to hold fast their gates and wait for morning. Across the river for us, to the safety of the eastern bank. Let us prepare our spells for a morning reprisal that will leave our enemies melted between the river and King Bruenor\u0027s hall.\"\n Many heads nodded in agreement, and as Alustriel\u0027s eyes flashed with the sheerest intensity, Catti-brie could only wonder what mighty dweomers the Lady of Silverymoon would cast upon the foolish orcs when dawn revealed them.\n Seated on the edge of a disk, her feet dangling just inches above the cold and dark rushing waters of the Surbrin, Catti-brie stared back at Mithral Hall with a mixture of emotions, not least among them guilt, and fear for her beloved home and for her beloved husband. Drizzt had gone to the north, and the army had descended from that direction. Yet he had not returned in front of the marching force with a warning, she knew, for she had not seen the lightning arrows of Taulmaril streaking through the night sky.\n Catti-brie looked down at the water and steeled her thoughts and her heart.\n Asa Havel, sitting beside her, put a hand on her shoulder. When she looked at the half-elf, he offered a warm and comforting smile. That smile turned a bit mischievous, and he nodded down to her torn boot. Catti-brie followed his gaze then looked back up at him, her face flushed with embarrassment.\n But the elf nodded and shrugged, and lifted his red and black hair by his left ear, turning his head to catch the moonlight so that she could take note of a white scar running up the side of his head. He took her wand and assumed a pensive pose, tapping it against the side of his face, in line with the scar.\n \"You won\u0027t err like that again,\" he assured her with a playful wink, handing the wand back. \"And take heart, for your impressive meteor shower gave us the time to complete the floating disks.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t mine. It came from the ring Lady Alustriel loaned to me.\"\n \"However you accomplished it, your timing and your calm action saved our efforts. You will find a role in the morning.\"\n \"When we avenge Duzberyl,\" Catti-brie said grimly.\n Asa Havel nodded, and added, \"And the dwarves who no doubt fell this dark night.\"\n The shouting across the river ended soon after, silenced by a resounding bang as Mithral Hall slammed shut her eastern door. But as the wizards and Catti-brie set their camp for the evening, they heard more commotion across the dark water. The orcs scrambled around the towers and the wizards\u0027 previous encampment, tearing and smashing and looting, their grunts and assaults punctuated by the occasional crack of a thrown boulder hitting the bridge abutments, and bouncing into the water.\n Others settled down to sleep, but Catti-brie remained sitting, staring back at the darkness, where an occasional fire sprang to life, consuming a tent or some other item.\n \"I had an extra spellbook over there,\" one wizard grumbled.\n \"Aye, and I, the first twenty pages of a spell I was penning,\" said another.\n \"And I, my finest robes,\" a third wailed. \"Oh, but orcs will burn for this!\"\n A short while later, a rustle from the other direction, back to the east, turned Catti-brie and the few others who hadn\u0027t yet settled in for the night. The woman rose and limped across to stand beside Alustriel, who greeted the Felbarran contingent as they rushed in to investigate the night\u0027s tumult.\n \"We\u0027d set off for Winter Edge to quarry more stones,\" explained the leader, a squat and tough old character with a white beard and eyebrows so bushy that they hid his eyes. \"What in the grumble of a dragon\u0027s belly hit ye?\"\n \"Obould,\" Catti-brie said before Alustriel could respond.\n \"So much then for the good intentions,\" said the Felbarran dwarf. \"Never thought them dogs\u0027d sit quiet on the ground they\u0027d taken. Mithral Hall get breached?\"\n \"Never,\" said Catti-brie.\n \"Good enough then,\" said the dwarf. \"We\u0027ll push \u0027em back north o\u0027 the wall in short order.\"\n \"In the morning,\" said Alustriel. \"My charges are preparing their spells. I have ears and a voice in Mithral Hall to coordinate the counterattack.\"\n \"Might be then that we\u0027ll kill \u0027em all and not let any be running,\" said the dwarf. \"More\u0027s the fun!\"\n \"Set your camp by the river, and order your forces into small and swift groups,\" Alustriel explained. \"We will open magical gates of transport to the other bank and your speed and coordination in entering the battlefield will prove decisive.\"\n \"Pity them orcs, then,\" said the dwarf, and he nodded and bowed, then stormed off, barking orders at his grim-faced forces.\n He had barely gone a few strides, though, when there came a tremendous crash from across the way, followed by wild orc cheering.\n \"A tower,\" Alustriel explained to the surprised stares of all around her.\n Catti-brie cursed under her breath.\n \"We will extend our time at Mithral Hall,\" the Lady of Silvery-moon promised her. \"Our enemies have exploited a vulnerability that cannot be allowed to hold. We will sweep the orcs back to the north and chase them far from the doors.\"\n \"Then finish the bridge,\" another nearby wizard offered, but Alustriel was shaking her head.\n \"The wall first,\" she explained. \"Our enemies did us a favor by revealing our weakness. Woe to all in the North if the orcs had taken this ground after the bridge\u0027s completion. So our first duty after they are expelled is to complete and fortify that wall. Any orc excursion back to Mithral Hall\u0027s eastern door must come at a great cost to them, and must provide the time for us to disassemble the bridge. We will finish the wall and then we will finish the bridge.\"\n \"And then?\" Catti-brie asked, and Alustriel and the other wizards looked at her curiously.\n \"You will return to Silverymoon?\" Catti-brie asked.\n \"My duties are there. What else would you suggest?\"\n \"Obould has shown his hand,\" Catti-brie replied. \"There is no peace to be found while he is camped north of Mithral Hall.\"\n \"You ask me to rally an army,\" said Alustriel.\n \"Have we a choice?\"\n Alustriel paused and considered the woman\u0027s words. \"I know not,\" she admitted. \"But let us first concentrate on the battle at hand.\" She turned to the nearby wizards. \"Sleep well, and when you awaken, prepare your most devastating evocations. Join with each other when you open your spellbooks, and coordinate your efforts and complement your spells. I want these orcs utterly destroyed. Let their folly serve as a warning that will keep their kin at bay long enough for us to strengthen the defenses.\"\n Many nods came back at her, along with a sudden and unexpected shout, \"For Duzberyl!\"\n \"Duzberyl!\" another cried, and another, and even those Silvery-moon wizards who had settled down for the night rose and joined in the chant. Soon enough, even the Felbarran dwarves joined in, though none of them knew what a \"Duzberyl\" might be.\n It didn\u0027t matter.\n More than once that night, Catti-brie awoke to the sound of a thunderous crash from across the river. That only steeled her determination, though, and each time, she fell back asleep with Lady Alustriel\u0027s promise in her thoughts. They would pay the orcs back in full, and then some.\n The preparations began before dawn, wizards ruffling the pages of their spellbooks, dwarves sharpening weapons. With a wave of yet another wand, Lady Alustriel turned herself into an owl, and flew off silently to scout out the coming battlefield.\n She returned in mere moments, and reverted to her human form as the first rays of dawn crept across the Surbrin, revealing to all the others what Alustriel had returned to report.\n Spellbooks snapped shut and the dwarves lowered their weapons and tools, moving to the riverbank and staring in disbelief.\n Not an orc was to be seen.\n Alustriel set them to motion, her minions opening dimensional doors that soon enough got all of them, dwarf, wizard, and Catti-brie alike, across the Surbrin, the last of them crossing even as Mithral Hall\u0027s eastern door banged open and King Bruenor himself led the charge out from the stronghold.\n But all they found were a dozen dead dwarves, stripped naked, and a dead wizard, still standing, held in place by a mighty javelin.\n The wizards\u0027 encampment had been razed and looted, as had the small shacks the dwarf builders had used. An assortment of boulders lay around the base of the damaged bridge abutment, and all of the towers and a good portion of the northern wall had been toppled.\n And not an orc, dead or alive, was anywhere to be found. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-22.html","bookId":2187,"book":{"id":2187,"title":"The Orc King (Transitions #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Orc King (Transitions #1) \n An uneasy peace between the dwarves of Mithral Hall and the orcs of the newly established Kingdom of Many-Arrows can`t last long.
