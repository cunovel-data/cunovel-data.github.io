{"id":100309,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Chieftain Dnark did not miss the simmer behind King Obould\u0027s yellow eyes whenever the orc king\u0027s glance happened his and Ungthol\u0027s way. Obould was continually repositioning his forces, which all of the chieftains understood was the king\u0027s way of keeping them in unfamiliar territory, and thus, keeping them dependent upon the larger kingdom for any real sense of security. Dnark and Ung-thol had rejoined their clan, the tribe of the Wolf Jaw, only to learn that Obould had summoned them to work on a defensive position north of Keeper\u0027s Dale, not far from where Obould had settled to ride out the fleeting days of winter.\\n\\n As soon as Obould had met Wolf Jaw at the new site, the wise and perceptive Dnark understood that there had been more to that movement than simple tactical repositioning, and when he\u0027d first met the orc king\u0027s gaze, he had known beyond doubt that he and Ung-thol had been the focus of Obould\u0027s decision.\\n\\n The annoying Kna squirmed around his side, as always, and shaman Nukkels kept to a respectful two paces behind and to his god-figure\u0027s left. That meant that Nukkels\u0027s many shamans were filtered around the common warriors accompanying the king. Dnark presumed that all of the orcs setting up Obould\u0027s three-layered tent were fanatics in the service of Nukkels.\\n\\n Obould launched into his expected tirade about the importance of the mountain ridge upon which the tent was being erected, and how the fate of the entire kingdom could well rest upon the efforts of Clan Wolf Jaw in properly securing and fortifying the ground, the tunnels, and the walls. They had heard it all before, of course, but Dnark couldn\u0027t help but marvel at the rapt expressions on the faces of his minions as the undeniably charismatic king wove his spell yet again. Predictability didn\u0027t diminish the effect, and that, the chieftain knew, was no small feat.\\n\\n Dnark purposely focused on the reactions of the other orcs, in part to keep himself from listening too carefully to Obould, whose rhetoric was truly hard to resist - sometimes so much so that Dnark wondered if Nukkels and the other priests weren\u0027t weaving a bit of magic of their own behind the notes of Obould\u0027s resonating voice.\\n\\n Wound in his contemplations, it took a nudge from Ung-thol to get Dnark to realize that Obould had addressed him directly. Panic washing through him, the chieftain turned to face the king squarely, and he fumbled for something to say that wouldn\u0027t give away his obliviousness.\\n\\n Obould\u0027s knowing smile let him know that nothing would suffice.\\n\\n \"My pennant will be set upon the door of my tent when it is ready for private audience,\" the orc king said - said again, obviously. \"When you see it, you will come for a private parlay.\"\\n\\n \"Private?\" Dnark dared ask. \"Or am I to bring my second?\"\\n\\n Obould, his smile smug indeed, looked past him to Ung-thol. \"Please do,\" he said, and it seemed to Dnark the enticing purr of a cat looking to sharpen its claws.\\n\\n Wearing a smug and superior smile, Obould walked past him, carrying Kna and with Nukkels scurrying in tow. Dnark scanned wider as the king and his entourage moved off to the tent, noting the glances from the king\u0027s warriors filtering across his clan, and identifying those likely serving the priests. If it came to blows, Dnark would have to direct his own warriors against the magic-wielding fanatics, first and foremost.\\n\\n He winced as he considered that, seeing the futility laid bare before him. If it came to blows with King Obould and his guard, Dnark\u0027s clan would scatter and flee for their lives, and nothing he could say would alter that.\\n\\n He looked to Ung-thol, who stared at Obould without blinking, watching the king\u0027s every receding step.\\n\\n Ung-thol knew the truth of it as well, Dnark realized, and wondered - not for the first time - if Toogwik Tuk hadn\u0027t led them down a fool\u0027s path.\\n\\n \"The flag of Obould is on the door,\" Ung-thol said to his chieftain a short while later.\\n\\n \"Let us go, then,\" said Dnark. \"It would not do to keep the king waiting.\"\\n\\n Dnark started off, but Ung-thol grabbed him by the arm. \"We must not underestimate King Obould\u0027s network of spies,\" the shaman said. \"He has sorted the various tribes carefully throughout the region, where those more loyal to him remain watchful of others he suspects. He may know that you and I were in the east. And he knows of the attack on the Moonwood, for Grguch\u0027s name echoes through the valleys, a new hero in the Kingdom of Many-Arrows.\"\\n\\n Dnark paused and considered the words, then began to nod.\\n\\n \"Does Obould consider Grguch a hero?\" Ung-thol asked.\\n\\n \"Or a rival?\" asked Dnark, and Ung-thol was glad that they were in agreement, and that Dnark apparently understood the danger to them. \"Fortunately for King Obould, he has a loyal chieftain\" - Dnark patted his hand against his own chest - \"and wise shaman who can bear witness here that Chieftain Grguch and Clan Karuck are valuable allies.\"\\n\\n With a nod at Ung-thol\u0027s agreeing grin, Dnark turned and started for the tent. The shaman\u0027s grin faded as soon as Dnark looked away. None of it, Ung-thol feared, was to be taken lightly. He had been at the ceremony wherein King Obould had been blessed with the gifts of Gruumsh. He had watched the orc king break a bull\u0027s neck with his bare hands. He had seen the remains of a powerful drow priestess, her throat bitten out by Obould after the king had been taken down the side of a ravine in a landslide brought about by a priestess\u0027s earth-shaking enchantment. Watching Grguch\u0027s work in the east had been heady, invigorating and inspiring, to be sure. Clan Karuck showed the fire and mettle of the very best orc warriors, and the priest of Gruumsh could not help but feel his heart swell with pride at their fast and devastating accomplishments.\\n\\n But Ung-thol was old enough and wise enough to temper his elation and soaring hopes against the reality that was King Obould Many-Arrows.\\n\\n As he and Dnark entered the third and final off-set entrance into Obould\u0027s inner chamber, Ung-thol was only reminded of that awful reality. King Obould, seeming very much the part, sat on his throne on a raised dais, so that even though he was seated, he towered over any who stood before him. He wore his trademark black armor, patched back together after his terrific battle with the drow, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. His greatsword, which could blaze with magical fire at Obould\u0027s will, rested against the arm of his throne, within easy reach.\\n\\n Obould leaned forward at their approach, dropping one elbow on his knee and stroking his chin. He didn\u0027t blink as he measured the steps of the pair, his focus almost exclusively on Dnark. Ung-thol hoped that his wrath, if it came forth, would be equally selective.\\n\\n \"Wolf Jaw performs brilliantly,\" Obould greeted, somewhat dissipating the tension.\\n\\n Dnark bowed low at the compliment. \"We are an old and disciplined clan.\"\\n\\n \"I know that well,\" said the king. \"And you are a respected and feared tribe. It is why I keep you close to Many-Arrows, so that the center of my line will never waver.\"\\n\\n Dnark bowed again at the compliment, particularly the notion that Wolf Jaw was feared, which was about as high as orc praise ever climbed. Ung-thol considered his chieftain\u0027s expression when he came back up from that bow. When the smug Dnark glanced his way, Ungthol shot him a stern but silent retort, reminding him of the truth of Obould\u0027s reasoning. He was keeping Wolf Jaw close, indeed, but Dnark had to understand that Obould\u0027s aim was more to keep an eye on the tribe than to shore up his center. After all, there was no line of battle, so there was no center to fortify.\\n\\n \"The winter was favorable to us all,\" said Dnark. \"Many towers have been built, and miles of wall.\"\\n\\n \"Every hilltop, Chieftain Dnark,\" said Obould. \"If the dwarves or their allies come against us, they will have to fight over walls and towers on every hilltop.\"\\n\\n Dnark glanced at Ung-thol again, and the cleric nodded for him to let it go at that. There was no need to engage Obould in an argument of defensive versus offensive preparations, certainly. Not with their schemes unfolding in the east.\\n\\n \"You were gone from your tribe,\" Obould stated, and Ung-thol started and blinked, wondering if the perceptive Obould had just read his mind.\\n\\n \"My king?\" Dnark asked.\\n\\n \"You have been away in the east,\" said Obould. \"With your shaman.\"\\n\\n Dnark had done a good job keeping his composure, Ung-thol believed, but then the shaman winced when Dnark swallowed hard.\\n\\n \"There are many rogue orcs left over from the fierce battles with the dwarves,\" Dnark said. \"Some strong and seasoned warriors, even shamans, have lost all their kin and clan. They have no banner.\"\\n\\n As soon as he spoke the words, Dnark shrank back a step, for a murderous scowl crossed Obould\u0027s powerful features. At either side of the tent chamber, guards bristled, a couple even growling.\\n\\n \"They have no banner?\" Obould calmly - too calmly - asked.\\n\\n \"They have the flag of Many-Arrows, of course,\" Ung-thol dared to interject, and Obould\u0027s eyes widened then narrowed quickly as he regarded the shaman. \"But your kingdom is arranged by tribe, my king. You send tribes to the hills and the vales to do the work, and those who have lost their tribes know not where to go. Dnark and other chieftains are trying to sweep up the rogues to better organize your kingdom, so that you, with great plans opening wide before your Gruumsh-inspired visions, are not cluttered by such minor details.\"\\n\\n Obould eased back in his throne and the moment of distress seemed to slip back from the edge of disaster. Of course with Obould, whose temper had left uncounted dead in his murderous wake, none could be sure.\\n\\n \"You were in the east,\" Obould said after many heartbeats had passed. \"Near the Moonwood.\"\\n\\n \"Not so near, but yes, my king,\" said Dnark.\\n\\n \"Tell me of Grguch.\"\\n\\n The blunt demand rocked Dnark back on his heels and crippled his denial as he replied with incredulity, \"Grguch?\"\\n\\n \"His name echoes through the kingdom,\" said Obould. \"You have heard it.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, you mean Chieftain Grguch,\" Dnark said, changing the inflection of the name to put emphasis on the \"Gr,\" and acting as if Obould\u0027s further remarks had spurred recognition. \"Yes, I have heard of him.\"\\n\\n \"You have met him,\" said Obould, his tone and the set of his face conveying that his assertion was not assumption, but known fact.\\n\\n Dnark glanced at Ung-thol, and for a moment the shaman thought his chieftain might just turn on his heel and flee. And indeed, Ung-thol wanted to do the same. Not for the first time and not for the last time, he wondered how they could have been foolish enough to dare conspire against King Obould Many-Arrows.\\n\\n A soft chuckle from Dnark settled Ung-thol, though, and reminded him that Dnark had risen through difficult trials to become the chieftain of an impressive tribe - a tribe that even then surrounded Obould\u0027s tent.\\n\\n \"Chieftain Grguch of Clan Karuck, yes,\" Dnark said, matching Obould\u0027s stare. \"I witnessed his movement through Teg\u0027ngun\u0027s Dale near the Surbrin. He was marching to the Moonwood, though we did not know that at the time. Would that I had, for I would have enjoyed witnessing his slaughter of the foolish elves.\"\\n\\n \"You approve of his attack?\"\\n\\n \"The elves have been striking at your minions in the east day after day,\" said Dnark. \"I think it good that the pain of battle was taken to their forest, and that the heads of several of the creatures were placed upon pikes at the river\u0027s edge. Chieftain Grguch did you a great service. I had thought his assault on the Moonwood to be at your command.\"\\n\\n He ended with an inflection of confusion, even suspicion, craftily turning the event back upon the orc king.\\n\\n \"Our enemies do not avoid their deserved punishment,\" Obould said without hesitation.\\n\\n At Dnark\u0027s side, Ung-thol realized that his companion\u0027s quick-thinking had likely just saved both their lives. For King Obould would not kill them and tacitly admit that Grguch had acted independent of the throne.\\n\\n \"Chieftain Grguch and Clan Karuck will serve the kingdom well,\" Dnark pressed. \"They are as fierce as any tribe I have ever seen.\"\\n\\n \"They breed with ogres, I am told.\"\\n\\n \"And carry many of the brutes along to anchor their lines.\"\\n\\n \"Where are they now?\"\\n\\n \"In the east, I expect,\" said Dnark.\\n\\n \"Near the Moonwood still?\"\\n\\n \"Likely,\" said Dnark. \"Likely awaiting the response of our enemies. If the ugly elves dare cross the Surbrin, Chieftain Grguch will pike more heads on the riverbank.\"\\n\\n Ung-thol eyed Obould carefully through Dnark\u0027s lie, and he easily recognized that the king knew more than he was letting on. Word of Grguch\u0027s march to the south had reached Obould\u0027s ear. Obould knew that the chieftain of Clan Karuck was a dangerous rival.\\n\\n Ung-thol studied Obould carefully, but the cunning warrior king gave little more away. He offered some instructions for shoring up the defense of the region, included a punishing deadline, then dismissed the pair with a wave of his hand as he turned his attention to the annoying Kna.\\n\\n \"Your hesitance in admitting your knowledge of Grguch warned him,\" Ung-thol whispered to Dnark as they left the tent and crossed the muddy ground to rejoin their clan.\\n\\n \"He pronounced it wrong.\"\\n\\n \"You did.\"\\n\\n Dnark stopped and turned on the shaman. \"Does it matter?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-21.html","bookId":2187,"book":{"id":2187,"title":"The Orc King (Transitions #1)","description":"Storyline: The Orc King (Transitions #1) \\n An uneasy peace between the dwarves of Mithral Hall and the orcs of the newly established Kingdom of Many-Arrows can`t last long.
