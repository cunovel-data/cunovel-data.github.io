{"id":100319,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"Wulfgar lingered around the outskirts of Auckney for several days. He didn\u0027t dare show his face in the town for fear that connecting himself to the new arrival at Castle Auck would put undue pressure on Lord Feringal, and create dangerous ramifications for Colson. But Wulfgar was a man comfortable in the wilds, who knew how to survive through the cold nights, and who knew how to keep himself hidden.\\n\\n Everything he heard about the lord and lady\u0027s new child brought him hope. One of the prevalent rumors whispered by excited towns-folk hinted that the girl was Feringal\u0027s and Meralda\u0027s own, and that she had been born in a sleep-state from which they had never expected her to awaken. And what joy now for the couple and the town that the child had recovered!\\n\\n Another rumor attached Colson to barbarian nobility, and claimed that her presence with Lord Feringal ensured security for the folk of Auckney - a wonderful thing in the tough terrain of the frozen North.\\n\\n Wulfgar absorbed it all with a growing sense that he had done well for Colson, for himself, and for Delly. Truly he had a hole in his heart that he never expected to fill, and truly he vowed that he would visit Auckney and Colson in the coming years. Feringal would have no reason to dismiss him or arrest him as time passed, after all, and indeed Wulfgar might find a level of bargaining power in the future, since he knew the truth of the girl\u0027s parentage. Lord Feringal wouldn\u0027t want him for an enemy, physically or politically.\\n\\n That was the barbarian\u0027s hope, the one thing that kept him from breaking down and rushing back into the town to \"rescue\" Colson.\\n\\n He continued to linger, to listen and to watch, for on more than one occasion he chanced to see Colson out with her new parents. He was truly amazed and heartened to see how quickly the young girl had adapted to her new surroundings and new parents, from afar at least. Colson smiled as often as she had in Mithral Hall, and she seemed at ease holding Meralda\u0027s hand and walking along in the woman\u0027s shadow.\\n\\n Similarly, the love Meralda held for her could not be denied. The look of serenity on her face was everything Wulfgar had hoped it would be. She seemed complete and content, and in addition to those promising appearances, what gave Wulfgar more hope still was the posture of Lord Feringal whenever he was near to the girl. There could be no doubt that Feringal had grown greatly in character over the years. Perhaps it was due to the support of Meralda, a woman Wulfgar knew to be possessed of extraordinary integrity, or perhaps it was due to the absence of Feringal\u0027s shrill sister.\\n\\n Whatever the cause, the result was clear for him to see and hear, and every day he lingered near to Auckney was a day in which he grew more certain of his decision to return the child to her rightful mother. It did Wulfgar\u0027s heart good, for all the pain still there, to think of Colson in Meralda\u0027s loving arms.\\n\\n So many times he wanted to run into Auckney to tell Colson that he loved her, to crush her close to him in his arms and assure her that he would always love her, would always protect her. So many times he wanted to go in and simply say goodbye. Her cries of \"Da!\u0027 still echoed in his mind and would haunt him for years and years, he knew.\\n\\n But he could not go in, and so as the days became a tenday, Wulfgar melted away down the mountain road to the east, the way he had come. The next day, he arrived at the end of the eastern pass, where the road ran south through the foothills to Luskan, and north to the long dale that traversed the Spine of the World and opened up into Icewind Dale.\\n\\n Wulfgar turned neither way at first. Instead he crossed the trail and scaled a rocky outcropping that afforded him a grand view of the rolling lands farther to the east. He perched upon the stone and let his mind\u0027s eye rove beyond the physical limitations of his vision, imagining the landscape as it neared Mithral Hall and his dearest friends. The place he had called home.\\n\\n He turned suddenly back to the west, thinking of his daughter and realizing just how badly he missed her - much more so than he\u0027d anticipated.\\n\\n Then back to the east went his thoughts and his eyes, to the tomb of Delly, lying cold in Mithral Hall.\\n\\n \"I only ever tried to do the best I could,\" he whispered as if talking to his dead wife.\\n\\n It was true enough. For all of his failures since his return from the Abyss, Wulfgar had tried to do the best he could manage. It had been so when he\u0027d first rejoined his friends, when he\u0027d failed and assaulted Catti-brie after a hallucinatory dream. It had been so during his travels with Morik, through Luskan and up to Auckney. So many times had he failed during those dark days.\\n\\n Looking west then looking east, Wulfgar accepted the responsibility for all of those mistakes. He did not couch his admission of failure with self-serving whining about the trials he had suffered at the claws of Errtu. He did not make excuses for any of it, for there were none that could alter the truth of his behavior.\\n\\n All he could do was do the best he could in all matters before him. That was what had led him to retrieve Delly\u0027s body. It was the right thing to do. That was what had led him not only to retrieve Colson from Cottie and the refugees, but to bring her home to Meralda. It was the right thing to do.\\n\\n And now?\\n\\n Wulfgar had thought he\u0027d sorted it all out, had thought his plans and road determined. But with the stark reality of those plans before him, he was unsure. He knelt upon the stone and prayed to Delly for guidance. He called upon her ghost to show him the way.\\n\\n Was Obould pounding on the doors of Mithral Hall yet again?\\n\\n Bruenor might need him, he knew. His adoptive father, who had shown him nothing but love for all those years, might need his strength in the coming war. Wulfgar\u0027s absence could result in Bruenor\u0027s death!\\n\\n The same could be true of Drizzt, or Regis, or Catti-brie. They might find themselves in situations in the coming days where only Wulfgar could save them.\\n\\n \"Might,\" Wulfgar said, and as he heard the word, he recognized that that would forever be the case. They might need him as he might need any of them, or all of them. Or perhaps even all of them together would one day soon be overcome by a black tide like the one of Obould.\\n\\n \"Might,\" he said again. \"Always might.\"\\n\\n Aside from the grim possibilities offered by the nearly perpetual state of war, however, Wulfgar had to remind himself of important questions. What of his own needs? What of his own desires? What of his own legacy?\\n\\n He was approaching middle age.\\n\\n Reflexively, Wulfgar turned from the east to face north, looking up the trail that would lead him to Icewind Dale, the land of his ancestors, the land of his people.\\n\\n Before he could fully turn that way, however, he looked back to the east, toward Mithral Hall, and envisioned Obould the Awful towering over Bruenor. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-31.html","bookId":2187,"book":{"id":2187,"title":"The Orc King (Transitions #1)","description":"Storyline: The Orc King (Transitions #1) \\n An uneasy peace between the dwarves of Mithral Hall and the orcs of the newly established Kingdom of Many-Arrows can`t last long.
