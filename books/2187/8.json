A slab of gray stone leaned against the eastern wall, beside the closed wooden door. It had been expertly cut from the center of the floor, and on it, engraved in the Dethek runes of the dwarves:\\n\\n DELENIA CURTIE OF LUSKAN AND MITHRAL HALL\\n\\n WIFE OF WULFGAR, SON OF KING BRUENOR\\n\\n MOTHER OF COLSON\\n\\n WHO FELL TO THE DARKNESS OF OBOULD\\n\\n IN THE YEAR OF THE UNSTRUNG HARP\\n\\n 1371 DALERECKONING\\n\\n TO THIS HUMAN\\n\\n MORADIN OFFERS HIS CUP\\n\\n AND DUMATHOIN WHISPERS HIS SECRETS\\n\\n BLESSED IS SHE\\n\\n Over the hole that had been made when the slab was removed, a stone sarcophagus rested on two heavy wooden beams. A pair of ropes ran out to either side from under it. The box was closed and sealed after Wulfgar paid his final respects.\\n\\n Wulfgar, Bruenor, Drizzt, Catti-brie, and Regis stood solemnly in a line before the sarcophagus and opposite the candles, while the other guests attending the small ceremony fanned out in a semi-circle behind them. Across from them, the cleric Cordio Muffinhead read prayers to the dead. Wulfgar paid no heed to those words, but used the rhythms of Cordio\u0027s resonant voice to find a state of deep contemplation. He recalled the long and arduous road that had brought him there, from his fall in the grasp of the yochlol in the battle for Mithral Hall, to his years of torment at the hands of Errtu. He looked at Catti-brie only once, and regretted what might have been.\\n\\n What might have been but could not be reclaimed, he knew. There was an old Dwarvish saying: k\u0027niko burger braz-pex strame - \"too much rubble over the vein\" - to describe the point at which a mine simply wasn\u0027t worth the effort anymore. So it was with him and Catti-brie. Neither of them could go back. Wulfgar had known that when he had taken Delly as his wife, and he had been sincere in their relationship. That gave him comfort, but it only somewhat mitigated the pain and guilt. For though he had been sincere with Delly, he had not been much of a husband, had not heard her quiet pleas, had not placed her above all else.\\n\\n Or could he even do that? Were his loyalties to Delly or to Mithral Hall?\\n\\n He shook his head and pushed that justification away before it could find root. His responsibility was to bring both of those responsibilities to a place of agreement. Whatever his duties to Bruenor and Mithral Hall, he had failed Delly. To hide from that would be a lie, and a lie to himself would destroy him.\\n\\n Cordio\u0027s chanting anesthetized him. He looked at the casket, and he remembered Delly Curtie, the good woman who had been his wife, and who had done so well by Colson. He accepted his own failure and he moved past it. To honor Delly would be to serve Colson, and to make of himself a better man.\\n\\n Delly forgave him, he knew in his heart, as he would forgive her if the situation had been reversed. That was all they could do in the end, really. Do their best, accept their mistakes, and go on to a better way.\\n\\n He felt her spirit all around him, and in him. His mind scrolled through images of the woman, flashes of Delly\u0027s smile, the tenderness on her face when they finished making love - a look, he knew without asking, that was reserved for him alone.\\n\\n He recalled a moment when he had observed Delly dancing with Colson, unaware of his presence. In all the time he had known her, never had Wulfgar seen her so animated, so free, so full of life. It was as if, through Colson, and for just that moment, she had found a bit of her own childhood - or the childhood that harsh circumstances had never allowed her to truly experience. That had been Wulfgar\u0027s rawest glance into the soul of Delly Curtie, more so even than in their lovemaking.\\n\\n That was the image that lingered, the image he burned into his consciousness. Forever after, he decided, when he thought of Delly Curtie, he would first envision her dancing with Colson.\\n\\n A wistful smile creased his face by the time Cordio stopped his chanting. It took Wulfgar a few moments to realize that everyone was looking at him.\\n\\n \"He asked if you wished to say a few words,\" Drizzt quietly explained to Wulfgar.\\n\\n Wulfgar nodded and looked around at the dwarves, and at Regis and Catti-brie.\\n\\n \"This is not where Delly Curtie would have chosen to be buried,\" he said bluntly. \"For all of her love for Clan Battlehammer, she was not fond of the tunnels. But she would be...she is honored that so fine a folk have done this for her.\"\\n\\n He looked at the casket and smiled again. \"You deserved so much more than life ever offered to you. I am a better man for having known you, and I will carry you with me forever. Farewell, my wife and my love.\"\\n\\n He felt a hand clasp his own, and turned to see Catti-brie beside him. Drizzt put his hand over both of theirs, and Regis and Bruenor moved to join in.\\n\\n Delly deserved better, Wulfgar thought, and I am not deserving of such friends as these.\\n\\n The sun climbed into the bright blue sky across the Surbrin before them. To the north along the battlements, the hammers rang out, along with a chorus of dwarf voices, singing and whistling as they went about their important work. Across the Surbrin, too, many dwarves and humans were hard at work, strengthening the bridge abutments and pillars and bringing up many of the materials they\u0027d need to properly construct the bridge that summer. For a strong hint of spring was surely in the air that fifth day of Ches, and behind the five friends, rivulets of water danced down the stony mountainside.\\n\\n \"It will be a short window, I am told,\" Drizzt said to the others. \"The river is not yet swollen with the spring melt, and so the ferry can cross. But once the melt is on in full, the pilots do not expect to execute many crossings. If you cross, you may not be able to get back until after the onset of Tarsakh, at least.\"\\n\\n \"There is no choice in the matter,\" said Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"It will take you tendays to get to Silverymoon and Sundabar and back anyway,\" said Regis.\\n\\n \"Especially since my legs aren\u0027t ready for running,\" said Catti-brie. She smiled as she spoke to let the others know that there was no regret or bitterness in her off-handed comment.\\n\\n \"Well, we ain\u0027t waitin\u0027 for Ches to become an old man,\" Bruenor grumbled. \"If the weather\u0027s holding, then we\u0027re out for Gauntlgrym in days. I\u0027m not for knowin\u0027 how long that\u0027s to take, but it\u0027ll be tendays, I\u0027m guessing. Might be the whole durned summer.\"\\n\\n Drizzt watched Wulfgar in particular, and noted the distance in the man\u0027s blue eyes. Bruenor might as well have been talking about Menzoberranzan or Calimport for all Wulfgar seemed to note or to care. He looked outward - to Colson.\\n\\n And farther, Drizzt knew. It didn\u0027t matter to Wulfgar whether or not the Surbrin could be crossed again.\\n\\n A few moments of silence slipped past, the five friends standing there in the morning sun. Drizzt knew that he should savor that moment, should burn it into his memory. Across from Bruenor, Regis shifted uneasily, and when Drizzt looked that way, he saw the halfling looking back at him, as if at a loss. Drizzt nodded at him and offered an accepting smile.\\n\\n \"The ferry docks,\" said Catti-brie, turning their attention to the river, where the boat was being quickly off-loaded. \"Our road awaits.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar nodded for her to lead on and make the arrangements, and with a curious glance at him, she did so, limping slightly and using Taulmaril as a crutch. As she went, Catti-brie kept glancing back, trying to decipher the curious scene. Wulfgar wore a serious expression as he spoke to the three, then he hugged each of them in turn. He ended with his hand firmly grasping Drizzt\u0027s wrist, the drow similarly holding him, and the two staring long at each other, with respect and what seemed to Catti-brie to be solemn agreement.\\n\\n She suspected what that might foretell, but she turned her attention back to the river and the ferry, and cast those suspicions aside.\\n\\n \"Come on, elf,\" Bruenor said before Wulfgar had even caught up to Catti-brie at the ferry. \"I\u0027m wanting to get our maps in order for the trip. No time for wasting!\"\\n\\n Muttering to himself and rubbing his hands together, the dwarf moved back into the complex. Regis and Drizzt waited just a bit longer then turned and followed. They slowed in unison as they neared the open doors and the darkness of the corridor, and turned to look back to the river, and to the sun climbing into the sky beyond.\\n\\n \"Summer cannot come quickly enough for me,\" said Regis.\\n\\n Drizzt didn\u0027t answer, but his expression wasn\u0027t one of disagreement.\\n\\n \"Though I almost fear it,\" Regis added, more quietly.\\n\\n \"Because the orcs will come?\" asked Drizzt.\\n\\n \"Because others may not,\" said Regis, and he tossed a glance at the departing duo, who had boarded the ferry and were looking to the east, and not back.\\n\\n Again, Drizzt didn\u0027t disagree. Bruenor was too preoccupied to see it, perhaps, but Regis\u0027s fears had confirmed Drizzt\u0027s suspicions about Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"Pwent\u0027s going with us,\" Bruenor announced to Drizzt and Regis when they caught up to him in his audience chamber later that day. As he spoke, he reached down to the side of his stone throne, lifted a pack, and tossed it to Drizzt.\\n\\n \"Just you three?\" Regis asked, but he bit off the question as Bruenor reached down again and brought up a second pack, and tossed it the halfling\u0027s way.\\n\\n Regis gave a little squeak and managed to get out of the way. The pack didn\u0027t hit the floor, though, for Drizzt snapped out his hand and plucked it from the air. The drow kept his arm extended, holding the pack out to the startled halfling.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m needin\u0027 a sneak. Yerself\u0027s a sneak,\" Bruenor explained. \"Besides, ye\u0027re the only one who\u0027s been into the place.\"\\n\\n \"Into the place?\"\\n\\n \"Ye fell in the hole.\"\\n\\n \"I was only in there for a few moments!\" Regis protested. \"I didn\u0027t see anything other than the wag - \"\\n\\n \"That makes yerself the expert,\" stated Bruenor.\\n\\n Regis looked to Drizzt for help, but the drow just stood there holding out the satchel. With a look back to Bruenor and his unrelenting grin, the halfling gave a resigned sigh and took the pack.\\n\\n \"Torgar\u0027s coming, too,\" said Bruenor. \"I\u0027m wantin\u0027 them Mirabar boys in this from the beginning. Gauntlgrym\u0027s a Delzoun place, and Delzoun\u0027s including Torgar and his boys.\"\\n\\n \"Five, then?\" asked Drizzt.\\n\\n \"And Cordio\u0027s making it six,\" Bruenor replied.\\n\\n \"In the morning?\" asked Drizzt.\\n\\n \"The spring, the first of Tarsakh,\" Regis argued - rather helplessly, since he was holding a full pack, and since, as he spoke, he noted that Pwent, Torgar, and Cordio all entered the room from a side door, all with heavy packs slung over their shoulders, and Pwent in his full suit of ridged and spiked armor.\\n\\n \"No time better\u0027n this time,\" said Bruenor. He stood up and gave a whistle, and a door opposite from the one the three dwarves had just used pushed open and Banak Brawnanvil rolled himself out. Behind him came a pair of younger dwarves, carrying Bruenor\u0027s mithral armor, his one-horned helmet, and his old and battle-worn axe.\\n\\n \"Seems our friend has been plotting without us,\" Drizzt remarked to Regis, who didn\u0027t seem amused.\\n\\n \"Yerself\u0027s got the throne and the hall,\" Bruenor said to Banak, and he moved down from the dais and tightly clasped his old friend\u0027s offered hand. \"Ye don\u0027t be too good a steward, so that me folk won\u0027t want me back.\"\\n\\n \"Not possible, me king,\" said Banak. \"I\u0027d make \u0027em take ye back, even if it\u0027s just to guard me throne.\"\\n\\n Bruenor answered that with a wide, toothy smile, his white teeth shining through his bushy orange-red beard. Few dwarves of Clan Battlehammer, or elsewhere for that matter, would speak to him with such irreverence, but Banak had more than earned the right.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 in peace because I\u0027m knowing that I\u0027m leaving yerself in charge behind me,\" Bruenor said in all seriousness.\\n\\n Banak\u0027s smile disappeared and he gave his king a grateful nod.\\n\\n \"Come on, then, elf, and yerself, Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor called, slipping his mithral mail over his head and dropping his battered old one-horned helm on his head. \"Me boys\u0027ve dug us a hole out in the west so that we\u0027re not needing to cross all the way back over Garumn\u0027s Gorge, then back around the mountain. No time for wasting!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I\u0027m not thinking that stoppin\u0027 to wipe out a fort o\u0027 them orcs is wastin\u0027 time,\" Thibble dorf Pwent remarked as he eagerly led the other two across in front of Drizzt and Regis and over to Bruenor. \"Might that we\u0027ll find the dog Obould himself and be rid o\u0027 the beast all at once.\"\\n\\n \"Simply wonderful,\" Regis muttered, taking the pack and slinging it over his shoulder. He gave another sigh, one full of annoyance, when he saw that his small mace was strapped to the flap of the pack. Bruenor had taken care of every little detail, it seemed.\\n\\n \"The road to adventure, my friend,\" said Drizzt.\\n\\n Regis smirked at him, but Drizzt only laughed. How many times had he seen that same look from the halfling over the years? Always the reluctant adventurer. But Drizzt knew, and so did everyone else in the room, that Regis was always there when needed. The sighs were just a game, a ritual that somehow allowed Regis to muster his heart and his resolve.\\n\\n \"I am pleased that we have an expert to lead us down this hole,\" Drizzt remarked quietly as they fell into line behind the trio of dwarves.\\n\\n Regis sighed.\\n\\n It occurred to Drizzt as they passed the room where Delly had just been interred that some were leaving who wanted to stay, and some were staying who wanted to leave. He thought of Wulfgar and wondered if that pattern would hold. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-8.html","bookId":2187,"book":{"id":2187,"title":"The Orc King (Transitions #1)","description":"Storyline: The Orc King (Transitions #1) \\n An uneasy peace between the dwarves of Mithral Hall and the orcs of the newly established Kingdom of Many-Arrows can`t last long.
