{"id":2837,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35","content":"The mail-packet was to sail in the afternoon. \n \n I went down to the quay. My things were already on board. Herr Mack pressed my hand, and said encouragingly that it would be nice weather, pleasant weather; he would not mind making the trip himself in such weather. The Doctor came walking down. Edwarda was with him; I felt my knees beginning to tremble. \n \n “Came to see you safely off,” said the Doctor. \n \n I thanked him. \n \n Edwarda looked me straight in the face and said: \n \n “I must thank you for your dog.” She pressed her lips together; they were quite white. Again she had called me “Eder.” [Footnote: The most formal mode of address.] \n \n “When does the boat go?” the Doctor asked a man. \n \n “In half an hour.” \n \n I said nothing. \n \n Edwarda was turning restlessly this way and that. \n \n “Doctor, don’t you think we may as well go home again?” she said. “I have done what I came for to do.” \n \n “You have done what you came to do,” said the Doctor. \n \n She laughed, humiliated by his everlasting correction, and answered: \n \n “Wasn’t that almost what I said?” \n \n “No,” he answered shortly. \n \n I looked at him. The little man stood there cold and firm; he had made a plan, and he carried it out to the last. And if he lost after all? In any case, he would never show it; his face never betrayed him. \n \n It was getting dusk. \n \n “Well, good-bye,” I said. “And thanks for — everything.” \n \n Edwarda looked at me dumbly. Then she turned her head and stood looking out at the ship. \n \n I got into the boat. Edwarda was still standing on the quay. When I got on board, the Doctor called out “Good-bye!” I looked over to the shore. Edwarda turned at the same time and walked hurriedly away from the quay, the Doctor far behind. That was the last I saw of her. \n \n A wave of sadness went through my heart . . . \n \n The vessel began to move; I could still see Herr Mack’s sign: “Salt and Barrels.” But soon it disappeared. The moon and the stars came out; the hills towered round about, and I saw the endless woods. There is the mill; there, there stood my hut, that was burned; the big grey stone stands there all alone on the site of the fire. Iselin, Eva . . . \n \n The night of the northern lights spreads over valley and hill. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1197/36005.html","bookId":112,"book":{"id":112,"title":"Pan","description":"简介： These last few days I have been thinking and thinking of the Nordland summer, with its endless day.
