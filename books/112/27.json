{"id":2829,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"The Baron is going away. Well and good: I will load my gun, go up into the hills, and fire a salvo in his honour and Edwarda’s. I will bore a deep hole in a rock and blow up a mountain in his honour and Edwarda’s. And a great boulder shall roll down the hillside and dash mightily into the sea just as his ship is passing by. I know a spot — a channel down the hillside — where rocks have rolled before and made a clean road to the sea. Far below there is a little boat-house. \n \n “Two mining drills,” I say to the smith. \n \n And the smith whets two drills . . . \n \n Eva has been put to driving back and forth between the mill and the quay, with one of Herr Mack’s horses.

Every evening I meet her. \n \n “You look as if you had no troubles, Eva, my love.” \n \n “You call me your love! I am an ignorant woman, but I will be true to you. I will be true to you if I should die for it. Herr Mack grows harsher and harsher every day, but I do not mind it; he is furious, but I do not answer him.

He says to me: ‘Aha, it’s that lieutenant you’ve got in your head all the time!’ I answer: ‘Yes, I am his.’ Then he says: ‘Ah, you wait. I’ll soon get rid of him.’ He said that yesterday.” \n \n “It doesn’t matter; let him threaten . . . ” And with closed eyes she throws her arms about my neck. A quiver passes through her. The horse stands waiting. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1197/35997.html","bookId":112,"book":{"id":112,"title":"Pan","description":"简介： These last few days I have been thinking and thinking of the Nordland summer, with its endless day.
