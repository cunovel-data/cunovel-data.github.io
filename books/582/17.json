{"id":23867,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr Fogg. He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or according to his inveterate habit, took a hand at whist. \\n\\n Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the `Mongolia\u0027, who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the `Rangoon\u0027, was following Mr Fogg\u0027s tracks step by step. What was Fix\u0027s object? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes - which he religiously preserved - that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same steamer. \\n\\n Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe. But as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanationhufry!\u0027 \\n\\n `Mr Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama?\u0027 \\n\\n `Terribly anxious.\u0027 \\n\\n `You believe in this journey around the world, then?\u0027 \\n\\n `Absolutely. Don\u0027t you, Mr Fix?\u0027 \\n\\n `I? I don\u0027t believe a word of it.\u0027 \\n\\n `You\u0027re a sly dog!\u0027 said Passepartout, winking at him. \\n\\n This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to think. But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective? Yet, in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed. \\n\\n Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his tongue. \\n\\n `\b￡÷úàt he determined to chaff Fix, w!!! ò\u0005?eeàQ\u000e??\u0015\u0004(á?Mr Fix,\u0027 said he, in a bantering tone; `shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?\u0027 \\n\\n `Why,\u0027 responded Fix, a little embarrassed, `I don\u0027t know; perhaps--\u0027 \\n\\n `Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the Peninsular Company, you know, can\u0027t stop on the way! You were only going to Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and from America to Europe is only a step.\u0027 \\n\\n Fix lookedned half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked. \\n\\n Fix, who suspected Mr Fogg\u0027s every movement, followed them cautiously, without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his sleeve at Fix\u0027s manoeuvres, went about his usual errands. \\n\\n The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of clove-trees whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower. Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields; sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles. \\n\\n After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking, irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten o\u0027clock they re-embarked, closely followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight. \\n\\n Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes - a fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation - was waiting for them on deck. He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them. \\n\\n At eleven o\u0027clock the `Rangoon\u0027 rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a vewbeen more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune. \\n\\n It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda\u0027s eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveri\u001cù\u0012~àoon\u0027 had a large quota of p\u0001]\u0014\u0002!!! ò\u0002\u0002ee?P\u000e??\u0016\u0004(á?es. \\n\\n One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant. \\n\\n `The valves are not sufficiently charged!\u0027 he exclaimed. `We are not going. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events go fction of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to the defective construction of the `Rangoon\u0027, however, unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least. Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer and the crew, and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot impatience. \\n\\n `You are in a great hurry, then,\u0027 said Fix to him one day, `to reach Hong Kong?\u0027 \\n\\n `A very great hurry!\u0027 \\n\\n `Mr Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama?\u0027 \\n\\n `Terribly anxious.\u0027 \\n\\n `You believe in this journey around the world, then?\u0027 \\n\\n `Absolutely. Don\u0027t you, Mr Fix?\u0027 \\n\\n `I? I don\u0027t believe a word of it.\u0027 \\n\\n `You\u0027re a sly dog!\u0027 said Passepartout, winking at him. \\n\\n This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to think. But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective? Yet, in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed. \\n\\n Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his tongue. \\n\\n `Mr Fix,\u0027 said he, in a bantering tone; `shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?\u0027 \\n\\n `Why,\u0027 responded Fix, a little embarrassed, `I don\u0027t know; perhaps--\u0027 \\n\\n `Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the Peninsular Company, you know, can\u0027t stop on the way! You were only going to Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and from America to Europe is only a step.\u0027 \\n\\n Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene as possible, and laughed with him. But Passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation. \\n\\n `Yes, and no,\u0027 returned Fix; `there is good and bad luck in such things. But you must understand that I don\u0027t travel at my own expense.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh, I am quite sure of that!\u0027 cried Passepartout, laughing heartily. \\n\\n Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective. But had he told his master? What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not? Was the game, then, up? Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course it was best to take. \\n\\n Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all. Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber. \\n\\n Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference. He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him. Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star, which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman\u0027s heart. But no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout\u0027s great surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune. \\n\\n It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda\u0027s eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries. \\n\\n One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant. \\n\\n `The valves are not sufficiently charged!\u0027 he exclaimed. `We are not going. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!\u0027 \\n\\n 可是路路通这一回可真的把这件怪事仔细琢磨了半天，为什么费克斯又一次跟他主人同坐一条船？的确，至少总让人觉得有点奇怪。这位费克斯先生人很体面，待人又殷勤得不得了。先是在苏伊士碰见他，他乘了蒙古号，后来他在孟买下船了，他说要留在孟买，可是这回在这一条去香港的仰光号上却又碰见他了。一句话说透了，他是寸步不离地紧盯着福克先生，那么这件事就值得考虑考虑了。要说碰巧吧，那也巧得太奇怪了。这个费克斯是谁派来的呢？路路通现在敢拿他的拖鞋打赌——他是非常珍惜自己的拖鞋的，他断定费克斯又准会跟他们同时离开香港；也许又会同坐一条船。\\n\\n 路路通就是想上一百年，他也想不出来这位侦探要跟着他们干什么。他绝没想到斐利亚·福克会被人家当作窃贼盯在后头，满世界兜圈子。但是，路路通是属于那种对任何事都能找出答案的人，他现在一下子恍然大悟了，他找到了费克斯一直盯住他们的答案，而且说真话，这个答案倒象是很入情合理的。其实在路路通看来，费克斯只是，也只会是改良俱乐部和福克打赌的同僚们派来跟踪的人，目的是要了解福克先生这次环游地球，是不是按照商定的路线老老实实进行的。\\n\\n “就是这么回事！准没错儿！”这个老实的小伙子自言自语地说，他非常满意自己的判断力。“他是那些老爷们派来跟踪我们的密探！这事干得可真不体面！福克先生为人这么诚实，又这么有信用，叫个密探盯他的梢！啊！改良俱乐部的老爷们，这件事你们可又不上算了！”\\n\\n 路路通对自己的发现非常得意，但是他决定一点也不跟福克先生讲，因为他怕把改良俱乐部老爷们这种不正当的怀疑告诉他主人，会伤他主人的自尊心。可是他拿定主意找个机会拿费克斯开开心，从旁边拿话逗他，但是决不给他说穿。\\n\\n 10月30日星期三下午，仰光号进入了马六甲半岛和苏门答腊当中的马六甲海峡。许多险峻秀丽的小山岛吸引着旅客的注意，使他们顾不得再去欣赏苏门答腊的风光。\\n\\n 第二天早晨四点钟，仰光号比规定航行时间提前半天到达新加坡。它要在这里加煤。\\n\\n 斐利亚·福克把这提早的半天时间记在旅行日程表的“盈余时间”栏内。因为艾娥达夫人希望利用这几小时上岸去走走，所以福克先生就陪她一齐下了船。\\n\\n 费克斯对于福克的任何行动都发生怀疑，因此他也偷偷地跟着下了船。路路通看见费克斯在玩这种鬼把戏，忍不住在背地里好笑，他随后也上岸去买东西去了。\\n\\n 新加坡岛的外貌既不广阔又不雄伟，它缺少作为海岛背景的大山，但是它仍然十分清秀可爱。它象是一座交织着美丽的公路的花园。艾娥达夫人和福克先生坐在一辆漂亮的马车里，前面由两匹新荷兰进口的骏马拖着，在长着绿油油叶子的棕榈和丁香树丛中奔驰。有名的丁香子就是由这些丁香树上半开的花心作成的。这里一丛丛的胡椒树，代替了在欧洲农村用带刺植物筑成的篱笆，椰子树和大棵的羊齿草伸展着密茂的枝叶，点缀着这热带地区的风景。那些深色绿叶的豆蔻树播散着浓郁的香气。树林里还有成群鬼鬼祟祟的猴子。有时在这密茂的树林里也会发现老虎的踪迹。如果你感到惊奇，要想知道为什么在这个并不算大的岛上直到现在还没有消灭这种可怕的野兽，人们会告诉你，这些野兽都是从马六甲泅水过来的。\\n\\n 艾娥达夫人和她的旅伴坐着马车在乡下游览了两小时，福克先生心不在焉地观赏了一下周围的风光，于是他们就回城里去了。这是一个挤满了高楼大厦的城市。城市周围有很多美丽的花园。花园里种着芒果树、凤梨和各种世界上最美味的果树。\\n\\n 十点钟他们又回到船上。费克斯也坐了一辆马车盯着他们兜了一圈，什么也没有发现，现在他又得自己付出车钱。\\n\\n 路路通在仰光号甲板上等着他们。他买了几十个象普通苹果一样大的芒果。这种水果外面的皮是深棕色的，里面的皮是鲜红色的，中间的果肉却是雪白的。好吃的人把它往嘴里一放真会感到无比的鲜美。路路通兴高采烈地把这些芒果送给艾娥达夫人，艾娥达亲切地向他表示了感谢。\\n\\n 十一点钟，仰光号加好了煤，就离开了新加坡。过了几小时，旅客已经看不见那些长着密茂的森林和隐藏着最美丽的猛虎的马六甲的高山了。\\n\\n 新加坡距离这个从中国海岸割出去的一小块英国领地——香港约一千三百海里。斐利亚·福克希望至多不超过六天的时间到达香港，以便赶上11月6日从那里开往日本大商港横滨的那一班客船。\\n\\n 仰光号上的旅客非常多。很多都是在新加坡上的船，其中有印度人、锡兰人、中国人、马来亚人和葡萄牙人，他们大多数都是二等舱的旅客。\\n\\n 天气本来一直相当好，但是，随着半圆的月亮在东方出现的时候，天气变坏了。海上滚动着巨浪，海风有时刮得很紧，幸亏风是从东南方吹来的，它有利于仰光号的航行。当风向还比较顺利的时候，船长命令张起全部船帆。仰光号上有双桅船的装备，它经常张起前桅帆和两个角帆航行。由于海风和引擎的双重动力，航行的速度大大提高。仰光号就这样在急促而有时使人晕眩的海浪中，沿着安南和交趾支那的海岸前进。\\n\\n 船上大部分旅客都由于船身不停地颠簸而晕船了。造成这种情况的主要原因与其说是海浪，倒不如说是仰光号本身。\\n\\n 说实在话，这些在中国沿海航行的半岛公司的轮船在构造方面确实有严重的缺点。对于空船和满载两种排水量的比例计算得很不正确，因此就经不起海上的风浪。它们底部不透水的密封水舱的容积也不够大。用海船上的术语来说就是“喝饱了”，所以在这种情况下，只要再有几个大浪头打到船上，它就不能再照原样航行了。这种船要和法国的皇后号和柬埔寨号那些邮船来比，即使不比引擎和蒸汽机，就是光比船型也差得很远。象皇后号这一类法国邮船，按照工程师的计算即使浸入舱底的海水重量等于邮船本身的重量，也不会沉船。可是半岛公司的船，从加尔各答号、高丽号，一直到仰光号，只要浸入海水的重量达到船身重量的六分之一，船身就会沉入海底。\\n\\n 所以，一遇到坏天气就得加倍小心。有时还必须收起大帆放慢速度前进。这简直是浪费时间。虽然福克先生丝毫也没有因此表现出任何烦恼情绪，但是路路通可早就急得受不住了。他埋怨船长，埋怨大副，埋怨公司，他把船上所有的工作人员都骂了。也许是因为他想起了赛微乐街他那个没有关闭的煤气炉子，时时刻刻在耗费着他自己的钱，所以才显得更加急躁不安。\\n\\n “你们可真是急于要到香港吗？”有一天费克斯问路路通。\\n\\n “急得很。”路路通说。\\n\\n “你认为福克先生急于搭船去横滨吗？”\\n\\n “可以说是十万火急。”\\n\\n “你现在对于这个奇怪的环球旅行还信以为真吗？”\\n\\n “当然相信，您不相信吗，费克斯先生？”\\n\\n “我？我不相信这事儿。”\\n\\n “鬼家伙！”路路通眨一眨眼笑着说。\\n\\n 这句话把费克斯弄得如堕五里雾中。他自己也不知道为什么这一句话就会使他惶惶不安起来。难道这个法国人猜透了他的身分？他真不知道该怎么想才好。但是他的侦探身分，这是只有他自己知道的秘密，路路通怎么会知道呢？不过，看路路通对他说话的神气，显然他肚子里是有文章的。\\n\\n 另有一天，这小伙子简直说得更露骨了。他比费克斯可心直口快多了，肚子里从来藏不住话。他嘻皮笑脸地问费克斯：\\n\\n “嘿，费克斯先生，这一回到了香港，您真的就不走了吗？跟您分手，这对我们来说真是太不幸了。”\\n\\n “这个……”费克斯很窘地说，“我也难说！也许……”\\n\\n “啊！”路路通说，“要是您还能跟我们同路，那我真太幸运了。瞧，作为东方半岛公司的代理人，您怎么能半路留下来呢。您本来说只到孟买的，可是现在马上又要到中国了。美洲大陆已经不远，从美洲到欧洲也是近在眼前！”\\n\\n 费克斯注意地看着路路通这一副极其讨人喜欢的嘴脸。他也随和着路路通哈哈大笑了一阵。这时，路路通就高兴地问他：“您这种职业是不是出息很大？”\\n\\n “也大，也不大，”费克斯毫不在意地说，“有时候差事好，有时候不好。不过你全明白，我旅行并不要自己花钱！”\\n\\n “噢，这我早知道了！”路路通说着又大笑起来。\\n\\n 这一段谈话结束之后，费克斯回到自己的房舱便开始琢磨起来。毫无疑问，他是被人家看穿了。无论如何反正这个法国人是知道他是密探了。可是，他告诉了他主人没有？他在这件事里面是个什么角色呢？他会不会是福克的同谋？这件事是不是已经漏底了，所以也就算吹了呢？费克斯很苦恼地想了好几个钟头，一会儿觉得一切都完了，一会儿又希望福克完全不了解他的情况，最后他还是不知道该怎么办才好。\\n\\n 这时，他定了定神，决定直截了当地对付路路通。如果到了香港还没有办法逮捕福克，如果到时候福克真的预备离开这最后的一块英国地盘，那么他，费克斯就跟路路通打开窗子说亮话。他要是福克的同谋，那么福克就什么都会知道，那么这件事也就全糟了；要是路路通与这件盗窃案毫无瓜葛，那么他就会为自己打算而撇开福克。\\n\\n 这就是费克斯和路路通相互之间的微妙关系。而斐利亚·福克则象是一颗高悬在他们之上的行星，漫不经心地在天空运行。他沿着自己的轨道环游地球，毫不忧虑那些在它周围运行的小行星。\\n\\n 但是在它旁边现在有一颗被天文学家称为“扰他”的女星，它本应该会在这位绅士的心中引起一些紊乱。然而事实并不是这样。艾娥达夫人的美丽对福克先生竟未发生任何影响，这真使路路通非常奇怪。如果这个“扰他”星所造成的星辰错乱真的成为事实的话，那将会比天王星所发生的星辰错乱（人们依靠天王星的星辰错乱，才发现了海王星）更加难以推算。\\n\\n 不错，这件事使路路通天天都感到奇怪。他从年轻的艾娥达夫人眼里看出了她对自己主人的无限感激之情。而斐利亚·福克心里显然是只想到英勇果敢地，而不是深情脉脉地尽自己的义务。至于目前旅行中可能碰到的事，以及这些事对他可能产生的影响，他根本就没有放在心上。\\n\\n 可是路路通却一直心神不定。有一天他伏在机车间的栏杆上，看着这架有时象发怒似的大机器在飞快转动，这时由于船身急剧地前后颠簸，推进器一露出水面就飞快地空转，于是活塞的运动就引起蒸汽不停地劈拍爆炸。路路通看了这种情况，好象他自己也要给气炸了。\\n\\n “机器空转了！”他嚷着说。“船不走了！瞧瞧这些英国人！啊！这要是一条美国人的船，他们会宁愿让它炸了，也不会叫它这样老牛拖破车似的跟咱们耗时间，泡蘑菇了。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/64/3710.html","bookId":582,"book":{"id":582,"title":"Around the World In 80 Days八十天环游地球","description":"简介： Around the World in Eighty Days (French: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours) is a classic adventure novel by the French writer Jules Verne, first published in 1873.
