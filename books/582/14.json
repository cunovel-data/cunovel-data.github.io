{"id":23864,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success. Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow\u0027s hand, and his master said, `Well done!\u0027 which, from him, was high commendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr Fogg. As for him, he had only been struck with a `queer\u0027 idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he, Passepartout, the ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been the spouse of a charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah! As for the young Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, wrapped up in a travelling-blanket, was reposing in one of the howdahs. The elephant, thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee, was advancing rapidly through the still dark-some forest, and, an hour after leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain. They made a halt at seven o\u0027clock, the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration. The guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off. Sir Francis, who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account. But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate. He told Phileas Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners. These fanatics were scattered throughout the country, and would, despite the English police, recover their victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta. She would only be safe by quitting India for ever. Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter. The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o\u0027clock, and the interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours. Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day, October 25th, at noon, for Hong Kong. The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station, whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet, a dress, shawl, and some furs; for which his master gave him unlimited credit. Passepartout started off forthwith, and found himself in the streets of Allahabad, that is, the `City of God\u0027, one of the most venerated in India, being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers, Ganges and Jumna, the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula. The Ganges, according to the legends of the Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence owing to Brahma\u0027s agency, it descends to the earth. Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a good look at the city. It was formerly defended by a noble fort, which has since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street. At last he came upon an elderly, crusty Jew, who sold second-hand articles, and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff, a large mantle, and a fine otter-skin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds. He then returned triumphantly to the station. The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield, and she became more herself, so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression. When the poet-king, Ucaf Uddaul, celebrates the charms of the queen of Ahmehnagara, he speaks thus:-- `Her shining tresses, divided in two parts, encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks, brilliant in their glow and freshness. Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine, equal and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dew-drops in a passion-flower\u0027s half-enveloped breast. Her delicately formed ears, her vermillion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor.\u0027 It is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity, and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up. The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed for his service, and not a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered all that this master owed to the guide\u0027s devotion. He had, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and he should be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also, must be disposed of. What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this question. `Parsee,\u0027 said he to the guide, `you have been serviceable and devoted. I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours.\u0027 The guide\u0027s eyes glistened. `Your honour is giving me a fortune!\u0027 cried he. `Take him, guide,\u0027 returned Mr Fogg, `and I shall still be your debtor.\u0027 `Good!\u0027 exclaimed Passepartout. `Take him, friend. Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast.\u0027 And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar, saying, `Here, Kiouni, here, here.\u0027 The elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head. Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the animal, which replaced him gently on the ground. Soon after, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty, and Passepartout, installed in a carriage with Aouda, who had the best seat, were whirling at full speed towards Benares. It was a run of eighty miles, and was accomplished in two hours. During the journey, the young woman fully recovered her senses. What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage, on the railway, dressed in European habiliments, and with travellers who were quite strangers to her! Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor, and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed, dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her, and recounting the happy sequel of the venture, the result of Passepartout\u0027s rash idea. Mr Fogg said nothing; while Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that `it wasn\u0027t worth telling\u0027. Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips. Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice, and recalled the dangers which still menaced her, she shuddered with terror. Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda\u0027s mind, and offered, in order to reassure her, to escort her to Hong Kong, where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up - an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted. She had, it seems, a Parsee relation, who was one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong, which is wholly an English city, though on an island on the Chinese coast. At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares. The Brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi, which, like Mahomet\u0027s tomb, was once suspended between heaven and earth; though the Benares of to-day, which the Orientalists call the Athens of India, stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth. Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts, giving an aspect of desolation to the place, as the train entered it. Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty\u0027s destination, the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city. He bade adieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him all success, and expressing the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion. Mr Fogg lightly pressed him by the hand. The parting of Aouda, who did not forget what she owed to Sir Francis, betrayed more warmth; and, as for Passepartout, he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general. The railway, on leaving Benares, passed for a while along the valley of the Ganges. Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar, with its mountains clothed in verdure, its fields of barley, wheat, and corn, its jungles peopled with green alligators, its neat villages, and its still thickly-leaved forests. Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of Indians, despite the advanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly their pious ablutions. These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators. What would these divinities think of India, anglicized as it is to-day, with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float upon its surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the faithful dwelling upon its borders? The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles south-westward from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading place, where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edge-tool factories, and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward. Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda, ruined Gour, Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country\u0027s flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness. Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him. According to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time. The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been seen, in the journey across India. But it is not to be supposed that Phileas Fogg regretted them. 至于那个年轻的印度女人，她对于这件事的全部经过一无所知，她现在被裹在旅行毯子里，躺在一个鞍椅上。 大象平安无事地顺从着帕西向导的驾驭，在阴暗的森林中飞快奔驰。离开庇拉吉庙一小时以后，它已经穿过了一片广阔的平原。七点钟，他们停下来休息。这位年轻的女人一直是昏昏沉沉不省人事。向导虽然给她喝了几口水和白兰地，但是因为她受的刺激太大了，还需要一段时间才能清醒过来。 柯罗马蒂知道她是被大麻烟熏昏了，不必为她担心。 柯罗马蒂旅长虽然认为这个印度女人恢复健康不成问题，但是对于她的未来归宿却感到很伤脑筋。 于是他马上对福克先生说，如果艾娥达夫人还留在印度，她一定会重新落到那些杀人魔王手里。这些家伙在整个印度半岛上为所欲为，连英国警察当局也无可奈何，不论是在马德拉斯、孟买或是在加尔各答，他们都有办法把他们要害死的人抓回去。柯罗马蒂为了证实自己的话，他叙述了不久以前发生的一件类似的事情。照他的意见，这个年轻的女人只有离开印度，才能真正脱离虎口。 斐利亚·福克回答说，他一定注意柯罗马蒂谈的这些问题，他将要考虑这件事。 快到十点钟的时候，向导宣布阿拉哈巴德到了。只要在阿拉哈巴德搭上火车，不用一天一夜就能到达加尔各答。 斐利亚·福克必须按时到达加尔各答，才能赶上第二天（10月25号）中午开往香港的那条邮船。 他们把艾娥达送到车站上一间屋子里，路路通负责去设法替她买各式各样的装饰品、衣服、纱丽、皮外衣等他所能弄到的一切东西。反正他的主人对他用钱，没有任何限制。 路路通立即动身跑遍了城里的几条大街。阿拉哈巴德是一座圣城，是印度最受尊敬的城市之一，因为它建筑在恒河和朱木拿河汇合的地方，这两条圣河吸引着整个印度半岛的香客。按照《罗摩衍那圣传》上记载，恒河发源于天上，多亏卜拉马的努力，这条河才从天上流到人间。路路通在买东西的时候，很快就把全城看了一遍，这里过去是工商业城市，可是现在既无商业，也无工业，从前保卫着城市的那座雄伟的碉堡，今天已经改成了监狱。路路通费尽力气也没有找到一家百货公司。他本想找到象在英国莱琴街菲门洋行附近那样一家百货公司，但最后他只是在一家犹太倔老头子开的估衣铺里才找到他所要买的东西：一件苏格兰料子的女长衫、一件宽大的斗篷、一件漂亮的獭皮短大衣。他立即付了七十五英镑（合一千八百七十五法郎），就得意洋洋地回车站去了。 艾娥达夫人现已逐渐清醒，那些庇拉吉庙的祭司给她造成的恐怖影响在她心里也已经逐渐消失。她那美丽的眼睛又恢复了诱人的印度丰采。 诗王乌萨弗·乌多尔在颂赞阿美娜加拉王后的美色时，曾经写过这样的诗句： “她那乌黑闪光整齐地分作两半的美发， 均称地围绕着雪白、娇嫩而又红润的双颊； 她那乌黑的蛾眉，象爱神卡马有力的弯弓两把。 一双亮晶晶的大眼，深藏在修长的睫毛下， 在那黑色的瞳人里，闪灼着圣洁的光华， 犹如喜马拉雅山圣湖的水光， 辉映着天空的朝霞。 她那细小而又整齐的牙齿，雪白无瑕， 在微笑的樱唇中发光， 就象一颗颗露珠覆盖着半开的石榴花。 在她那曲线对称、小巧玲珑的双耳上， 在她那红润的双手上， 在她那一双象两朵青莲一样丰满而又柔软的小脚上， 那是锡兰最美丽的珍珠在闪亮， 那是各尔贡最珍贵的钻石在发光。 她那纤细的柳腰一握不足， 这就更使她那丰满的胸部高高耸出， 愈显得她丰采绝殊！ 这样美丽的胸部展示着青春年华最宝贵的财富。 再看她那绩丝的短\u0001j@ ?僭籃， 用纯银铸成的美人腰腹。” 但是，我们可以完全不需要用这么多夸张的诗句，我们只要说一句话就行了：这位本德汗尔德老土王的寡妇艾娥达夫人即使按照欧洲的标准，也是一位很漂亮的夫人。她英文讲得很纯熟，向导说这位年轻的帕西女人已经被教育成另一种人了，这话真是半点也没有夸大。 火车马上就要从阿拉哈巴德开出，向导等着福克先生给他工资。福克先生按照他应得的钱如数支付，连一分钱也没多给。这使路路通感到有点奇怪，因为他估计他的主人对向导的忠诚帮助总该表示一点谢意的。的确，向导在庇拉吉庙事件中是自愿冒生命危险的，如果以后印度人知道了这件事，他就很难逃出毒手。 还有奇乌尼大象怎么办？这也是一个问题。花这么大价钱买了这个家伙，现在把它摆在哪儿？但是福克先生好象早已“胸有成竹”了。 “帕西人，”他对向导说，“你做事能干，为人忠诚。我给了你应得的工资，可是我还没有报答你的忠诚呢。你要这头象吗？它归你了。” 向导的眼里闪动着喜悦的光芒。 “先生，您这简直使我发财了。”他喊着说。 “牵走吧，”福克先生说，“虽然这样，我还是欠你的情。” “这太好了，”路路通叫着说，“牵走吧，老兄！奇乌尼真是一头又壮又听话的牲口。” 他一面走到大象跟前拿出几块糖喂它，一面不停地说： “吃吧，奇乌尼，吃吧，吃吧！” 大象满意地哼了几声，然后用它的长鼻子卷着路路通的腰，把他举得和头一样高。路路通一点也不害怕，用手亲切地抚摸大象，大象又把他轻轻地放到地上，路路通用手紧紧地握了一下诚实的大象的鼻尖作为还礼。 过了一会儿，福克先生、柯罗马蒂旅长和路路通已经坐在一节舒适的车厢里，艾娥达夫人占着一个最好的位子。火车飞快地开往贝拿勒斯去了。 经过两小时的行程，他们离开阿拉哈巴德已经快有八十英里了。 在这一段时间里，那位年轻的夫人已经完全清醒过来，“昂格”酒的麻醉作用已经消失了。当她发现自己坐在火车上，穿着欧式服装和这些素不相识的旅客坐在一起的时候，她简直觉得莫名其妙！开始，她的同伴们都无微不至地照护她，给她喝了一些酒，使她长长精神；然后旅长就把她的遭遇对她重述了一遍，旅长一再指出斐利亚·福克先生仗义救人的热诚，为了救她，简直是赴汤蹈火毫不犹豫。接着又告诉她由于路路通想出了一条惊人的妙计，才使这场冒险圆满结束。福克先生在旁边一言不发，听凭旅长去说。路路通呢，他感到很不好意思，一再重复说：“我——这不值得一提。” 艾娥达夫人向她的救命恩人表示衷心的感谢，这种感谢与其说是用语言，不如说是用眼泪表示的，她那美丽的眼睛比她那会讲话的双唇更能充分地表达她内心的感激。这时她一想到火葬场上的情景，一想到在这块印度的土地上还有很多灾难在等着她，便骇怕得颤抖起来。 斐利亚·福克先生很了解艾娥达夫人这种心情。为了使她安心，他说可以送她到香港去，她可以在那里等到这事平息之后再回印度。福克先生说这些话的时候，态度是冷冰冰的。 艾娥达夫人感激地接受了这个建议。正好她有一个亲戚住在香港，这个亲戚也是帕西人，他是香港的一个大商人，香港虽然是在中国海岸上，但却是一座道地的英国化的城市。 火车十二点半到达贝拿勒斯，据婆罗门教的传说，现在的贝拿勒斯是古代卡西城的旧址，卡西城从前就象穆罕默德的陵墓一样是空悬在天顶和天底之间的。但是在今天看来，这座被东方人文研究者称为印度雅典的贝拿勒斯却也是普普通通地建筑在土地上的，并没有什么特殊。路路通有时可以瞥见一些瓦房子和草屋，这些建筑呈现出一种异常荒凉的景象，没有一点地方色彩。 法兰西斯·柯罗马蒂先生要在这里下车，他的部队就驻扎在城北几英里以外的一个地方。于是旅长就向福克先生告别，并祝他这次旅行从此平安无事，更加顺利。福克先生轻轻拉了拉旅长的手。艾娥达夫人热情地为旅长祝福，她永远不会忘记法兰西斯·柯罗马蒂先生的大恩。至于路路通，因为和旅长热情的握手而感到很荣幸，他非常兴奋，他心里想，不知道何时何地才能再为他效劳。大家就这样分手了。 从贝拿勒斯出发，铁路穿过一段恒河山谷，天气相当晴朗，窗外显示出比哈尔千变万化的美丽景色：青翠的高山，生长着大麦、小麦和玉米的田野，栖居着浅绿色鳄鱼的河川和池沼，整整齐齐的村庄和四季常青的森林，几只大象和一些单峰的骆驼正在圣河里洗澡。虽然只是初秋，天气已相当寒冷，却还有成群的男女在恒河里虔诚地领受圣洗。这些善男信女是佛教的死对头，他们狂热地崇信婆罗门教。婆罗门教里有三个转世活佛：第一个是回斯奴，他是太阳神的化身，第二个是希瓦，他是生灵万物主宰的化身，第三个是卜拉马，他是一切婆罗门教教长和立法者的主宰。然而当汽船驶过，搅混了恒河圣水的时候，我们不知道卜拉马、希瓦和回斯奴又怎样看待今天这个英国化了的印度呢。 这一切景物，象闪电般一掠而过，有时被一阵浓浓的白烟，遮盖得模糊不清。沿途，旅客们只能隐约地看见：距贝拿勒斯城东南二十英里的比哈尔历代土王城寨——舒纳尔堡，加兹铺和这个城区一些制造玫瑰香水的大工厂；以及印度主要的鸦片市场——巴特那，还有那个比较欧化和英国化的城市——蒙吉尔，它很象英国的曼彻斯特或伯明翰，以冶铁、制造铁器和刀剑驰名。那些高大的烟囱喷吐着乌黑的浓烟，把整个卜拉马活佛的天空搞得乌烟瘴气。 在这个梦里天堂似的国度里，这些黑烟真是大煞风景。 黑夜降临了，火车继续向前飞驰着，虎、熊、狼等野兽在机车前面逃窜，发出一片吼声。人们既没有看见孟加拉的美景，也没有看见各尔贡和吉尔的废墟；既没有看见印度以前的京城穆尔希加巴，也没有看见布尔敦；既没有看见乌各里，也没有看见法国在印度领土上的那个据点昌德纳戈尔；路路通如果能看到祖国的旗帜在这个据点上空飘扬的话，也许还会更得意呢！ 火车终于在早晨七点钟到达加尔各答。去香港的邮船要到中午十二点才起锚。因此斐利亚·福克还有五个小时的空闲时间。 按照他的路程表，这位绅士应该在离开伦敦以后的第二十三天（10月25号）到达印度首都加尔各答。他现在不早不晚，如期赶到。可惜，从伦敦到孟买节省下来的两天时间，我们知道在穿过印度半岛的旅途中已经给占用了，但是我们相信福克先生对这一点是不会感到遗憾的。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/64/3722.html","bookId":582,"book":{"id":582,"title":"Around the World In 80 Days八十天环游地球","description":"简介： Around the World in Eighty Days (French: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours) is a classic adventure novel by the French writer Jules Verne, first published in 1873.
