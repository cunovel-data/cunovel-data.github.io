{"id":22995,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX.","content":"FROM SHANGHAI TO HONG-KONG.—A STORY OF THE COOLIE TRADE. The party reached Shanghai without accident, and on their arrival at that port the boys had a welcome surprise in the shape of letters from home. Their first letters from Japan had been received, and read and reread by family and friends. To judge by the words of praise that they elicited, the efforts of the youths at descriptive composition were eminently successful. Frank\u0027s mother said that if they did as well all through their journey as they had done in the beginning, they would be qualified to write a book about Japan and China; and a similar opinion of their powers was drawn from Fred\u0027s mother, who took great pride in her son. Mary and Effie composed a joint letter to Frank, to tell how much pleasure he had given them. They were somewhat anxious about the purchases, but were entirely sure everything would be correct in the end. Fred began to be a trifle jealous of Frank when he saw how much the latter enjoyed the communication from the girl who came to the railway station to see them off. He vowed to himself that before he started on another journey he would make the acquaintance of another Effie, so that he would have some one to exchange letters with. The letters were read and reread, and their perusal and the preparation of answers consumed all the time of the stay in Shanghai. The delay, however, was only for a couple of days, as the weekly steamer for Hong-kong departed at the end of that time, and our friends were among her passengers. Another of the ship\u0027s company was our old friend \"the Mystery,\" who told Doctor Bronson that he had been travelling in the interior of Japan, and had only recently arrived from there. He was going to Canton, and possibly farther, but could not speak with certainty until he had arranged some business at Hong-kong. The steamer on which our friends were travelling was under the French flag, and belonged to the line popularly known as \"the French Mail.\" The service between Europe and China is performed alternately by two companies, one of them English and the other French; and by[Pg 389] means of these two companies there is a weekly ship each way. The French steamers are preferred by a great many travellers, as they are generally larger than the English ones, and are admirably arranged for comfort. They make the voyage from Shanghai to Marseilles in about forty days, calling at the principal ports on the way, and going through the Suez Canal. The English steamers follow very nearly the same route as the French ones, as long as they are in Eastern waters; but when they reach the Mediterranean Sea, they have two lines, one going to Venice and the other to Southampton. The official names of the two companies are \"The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company\" (English), and \"La Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes\" (French). There were not many passengers, perhaps a dozen in all, and they were mostly merchants and other residents of Shanghai on their way to Europe or to some of the southerly ports of Asia. Two of the passengers were accompanied by their Chinese servants, and the boys were greatly amused to hear the efforts of the latter to speak English. They had already heard the same kind of thing during their movements in China, but had not paid much attention to it in consequence of their occupation with other matters. Now, however, they had some leisure for investigation, and Fred suggested that they had better take a glance at the Chinese language. A few glances were all they wanted, as Frank was not long in ascertaining that it would require years of study to acquaint himself with enough of the language to be able to converse in it. Fred learned, about the same time, that there was a written language and a spoken one, and the two were so unlike that a man can read and write Chinese without being able to speak it, and can speak without being able to read and write. They found that very few foreigners who came to China to stay for years ever troubled themselves to learn the language, but were contented with \"pidgin English.\" Then the question very naturally arose, \"What is pidgin English?\" SPECIMEN OF CHINESE WRITING. SPECIMEN OF CHINESE WRITING. In a small book entitled \"John, or Our Chinese Relations,\" Frank found something relating to pidgin English, which he copied into his note-book for future reference. When he had done with the volume, it was borrowed by Fred for the same purpose, and the boys gave a vote of thanks to the author for saving them the trouble to hunt up the information by asking questions of their friends. What they selected was as follows: [Pg 390] \"In attempting to pronounce the word \u0027business,\u0027 the Chinese were formerly unable to get nearer to the real sound than \u0027pidgin\u0027 or \u0027pigeon;\u0027 hence the adoption of that word, which means nothing more nor less than \u0027business.\u0027 Pidgin English is therefore business English, and is the language of commerce at the open ports of China, or wherever else the native and foreigner come in contact. A pidgin French has made its appearance in Saigon and at other places, and is steadily increasing as French commerce has increased. On the frontier line between Russia and China there is an important trading-point—Kiachta—where the commerce of the two empires was exclusively conducted for a century and a half. A pidgin Russian exists there, and is the medium of commercial transactions between the Russian and Chinese merchants. \"Long ago the Portuguese at Macao had a corresponding jargon for their intercourse with the Chinese: and it may be safely stated that wherever the Chinese have established permanent relations with any country, a language of trade has immediately sprung into existence, and is developed as time rolls on and its necessities multiply. \"The decline in Portuguese trade with China was accompanied with a corresponding decline in the language, but it left its impress upon the more recent pidgin English, which contains many Portuguese words. Pidgin English is a language by itself, with very little inflection either in noun, pronoun, or verb, and with a few words doing duty for many. The Chinese learn it readily, as they have no grammatical giants to wrestle with in mastering it, and the foreigners are quite ready to meet them on the road and adapt their phraseology to its requirements. The Chinese has only to commit to memory a few hundred words and know their meaning; the foreigner (if he be English-speaking) has less than a hundred foreign words to learn, together with the peculiar construction of phrases. The Chinese have printed vocabularies in which the foreign word and its meaning are set forth in Chinese characters, and thus they have no occasion to trouble themselves with the alphabet of the stranger. These books are specially intended for the use of compradores and servants in foreign employ, and are so small that they can be readily carried in the pocket. \"In pidgin English the pronouns he, she, it, and they are generally expressed by the single pronoun he. All the forms of the first person are included in my, and those of the second person in you. When we come to the verbs, we find that action, intention, existence, and kindred conditions are covered by hab, belongey, and can do. Various forms of possession are expressed by catchee (catch), while can do is particularly applied to ability or power, and is also used to imply affirmation or negation. Thus: \u0027Can do walkee?\u0027 means \u0027Are you able to walk?\u0027 If so, the response would be \u0027Can do,\u0027 while \u0027No can do\u0027 would imply inability to indulge in pedestrianism. Belongey comes from \u0027belong,\u0027 and is often shortened to a single syllable, b\u0027long. It is very much employed, owing to the many shades of meaning of which it is capable. Thus: \u0027I live in Hong-kong\u0027 would be rendered \u0027My belongey Hong-kong side,\u0027 and \u0027You are very large\u0027 would be properly translated \u0027You belongey too muchee big piecee.\u0027 \"The Chinese find great difficulty in pronouncing r, which they almost invariably convert into l. They have a tendency to add a vowel sound (o or e) to words ending with a consonant. Bearing these points in mind, we readily see how \u0027drink\u0027 becomes dlinko, and \u0027brown\u0027 blownee. Final d and t are awkward for them to handle, and th is to their lips an abomination of first-class dimensions. \u0027Child\u0027 becomes chilo, and \u0027cold\u0027 is transformed to colo, in pidgin English. \u0027That,\u0027 and other words beginning with th, generally lose the sound of h, though sometimes they retain h and drop the t before it. \u0027Side\u0027 is used for position, and the vocabulary contains inside, outside, bottom-side (below), and top-side (above). Chop-chop means \u0027fast,\u0027 \u0027quick,\u0027 \u0027immediately;\u0027 man-man means \u0027slowly,\u0027 \u0027slower,\u0027 \u0027gently,\u0027 in the south of China; while at Han-kow, on the Yang-tse, it means exactly the reverse. At Canton or Swatow, if you say man-man to your boatmen, they will cease rowing or will proceed very lightly; say the same thing to your boatmen at Han-kow or Ichang, and they will pull away with redoubled energy.\" [Pg 391] \"As we have learned the principles of this new language,\" Frank remarked, \"we ought to be able to understand some proverbs in it. For instance, here are four that contain whole heaps of good advice, besides showing us how to read pidgin English: \"\u0027Who man swim best, t\u0027hat man most gettee dlown; Who lidee best he most catch tumble down.\u0027 \"\u0027One piecee blind man healee best, maskee; One piecee deaf man makee best look-see.\u0027 \"\u0027One man who never leedee, Like one dly inkstand be; You turn he top-side downey, No ink lun outside he.\u0027 \"\u0027Suppose one man much had—how bad he be, One not\u0027her bad man may be flaid of he.\u0027\" \"Those will do,\" Fred answered, \"and here is Longfellow\u0027s famous poem \u0027Excelsior,\u0027 which every schoolboy knows, or ought to know. It was done into pidgin English by somebody who lived in the country and evidently knew what he was about: \"\u0027TOP-SIDE GALAH! \"\u0027T\u0027hat nightee teem he come chop-chop One young man walkee, no can stop; Maskee snow, maskee ice; He cally flag wit\u0027h chop so nice— Top-side Galah! \"\u0027He muchee solly; one piecee eye Lookee sharp—so fashion—my: He talkee large, he talkee stlong, Too muchee culio; allee same gong— Top-side Galah! \"\u0027Insidee house he can see light, And evly loom got fire all light; He lookee plenty ice more high, Insidee mout\u0027h he plenty cly— Top-side Galah! \"\u0027Olo man talkee, \"No can walk, Bimeby lain come, velly dark; Have got water, velly wide!\" Maskee, my must go top-side— [Pg 392]Top-side Galah! \"\u0027\"Man-man,\" one girlee talkee he: \"What for you go top-side look-see?\" And one teem more he plenty cly, But alla teem walk plenty high— Top-side Galah! \u0027\"Take care t\u0027hat spilum tlee, young man, Take care t\u0027hat ice, must go man-man.\" One coolie chin-chin he good night; He talkee, \"My can go all light\"— Top-side Galah! \"\u0027T\u0027hat young man die: one large dog see Too muchee bobbly findee he. He hand b\u0027long coldee, all same like ice, He holdee flag, wit\u0027h chop so nice— Top-side Galah!\u0027\" \"But does every Chinese who goes to a foreign country understand how to talk pidgin English?\" Frank asked of Doctor Bronson. \"Not by any means,\" was the reply; \"thousands of them are not able to speak a word when they go abroad, but they gradually pick up the language of the country to which they go. Not all of them go to America or other English-speaking lands; many have gone to Cuba, Peru, and Brazil, where there was no need of a knowledge of English. Spanish and Portuguese are the only tongues in use there, and many an emigrant never took the trouble to learn a word of them.\" Their old acquaintance \"the Mystery\" had joined the party while the conversation just recorded was going on. When the Doctor made allusion to the emigration to Cuba and Peru, \"the Mystery\" opened his eyes a little wider than was his custom, and said he was well aware that many had gone to those countries who knew nothing but Chinese, and never learned a word of any other language. As the boys showed a desire to hear more on the subject, he proposed to tell them something about the coolie-trade; and it was arranged that they should assemble in the[Pg 393] smoking-saloon after dinner, where they could talk at their leisure. After dinner they met as agreed, and \"the Mystery\" seated himself comfortably for the story he was about to tell. \"The coolie-trade,\" said he, \"does not exist any more. It was very much like the slave-trade, of which you have read; in fact, it was nothing more than the slave-trade with the form changed a little. In the African slave-trade the slaves were bought as one might buy sheep and cattle. In the coolie-traffic the men were hired for a term of years at certain stipulated[Pg 394] wages, and were to be returned to their homes at the end of that term, provided all their debts had been discharged. The plan was all right on its face, but it was not carried out. When the period for which he was engaged was up, the coolie was always made to be in debt to his employer; and, no matter how hard he might work, he was not allowed to free himself. He was a slave to his master just as much as was the negro from Africa, and not one coolie in a thousand ever saw his native land again. BARRACOONS AT MACAO. BARRACOONS AT MACAO. \"Not only were the men hired on contracts that they could never cancel, but they were stolen, just as slaves are stolen in Africa. Boats were sent up the rivers in the southern part of China to bring back loads of coolies. They would land an armed party at a village, seize all the men in the place, and bring them to the port, where they would be transferred to the dealers, who would send them to the places where their labor was needed. Macao was the great port for the coolie trade, and the Portuguese had large sheds there, which they called barracoons, for holding the coolies in prison till they were ready to ship them away. These barracoons were sometimes so crowded that thousands of coolies died there in the course of a single year. The natives called them \u0027chu-tze-kuan,\u0027 or \u0027pig-pens,\u0027 and they were so filthy that they richly deserved the name. [Pg 395] \"The name \u0027coolie\u0027 belongs properly to a tribe of natives on the northern coast of Africa, but it is applied to a laborer of any part of the East, and this is its meaning in Japan and China. COOLIES EMBARKING AT MACAO. COOLIES EMBARKING AT MACAO. \"The laborers who were to be taken to Cuba or Peru were received on board the ships, and counted as they came over the side, like so many boxes or bales of merchandise; in fact, they were nothing but merchandise, and the receipts were made out for a certain number of coolies without the least record of their names and residences. I was once in a ship that took a cargo of these people to Peru, and I don\u0027t believe that anybody on board felt otherwise than if he had been in the slave-trade. And we had a narrow escape from having our throats cut by our cargo and our bodies thrown into the sea.\" [Pg 396] \"Please tell us about that,\" said Fred. Frank echoed the request, and their informer nodded his consent. \"The ship had taken its cargo at Macao, and we went out to sea with a fine breeze. We had over a thousand \u0027passengers\u0027 in the hold, and only a small number were to be allowed on deck at one time, as several ships had been captured by the coolies, and we did not intend to be taken if we could help it. Two days after we started there was trouble among the coolies, and several of them ran about the space below-deck and threatened to set the ship on fire. They did build a fire of some of the dry boards used for making their sleeping-berths; but we covered the hatches with tarpaulins, and held the smoke down there, so that the coolies were nearly smothered and compelled to put the fire out themselves. ENRAGED COOLIE. ENRAGED COOLIE. \"The hatchways were covered with gratings to admit of a free circulation of air, and they were so firmly fastened that the coolies could not disturb them. Several men were on deck when the trouble began, and one of them tried to get through the grating to join his companions. He managed to squeeze his body through the opening, and then discovered too late that he had a fall of nearly thirty feet before him, as the hatch of the lower deck was open. He struggled a moment, then dropped to the lower hold, and was killed by the fall. A DEADLY FALL. A DEADLY FALL. \"It became necessary to fire on the mutineers, and for this we raised the tarpaulins over one of the hatches. The smoke poured out in a dense mass and almost smothered us, and we could only see the forms of the men very dimly, like a ship in a fog. We fired, and continued to fire till[Pg 397] several of them had been shot down, and all their efforts to get at us were of no avail. There were about sixty men in the crew, and, as we had over a thousand coolies on board, we had numbers against us fearfully. But they had no fire-arms, while we had a good supply of rifles and pistols, with plenty of ammunition. At the time of the outbreak there were not far from a hundred coolies on deck; but we drove them forward, and kept so large a guard over them that they could not have done anything to help their friends below if they had been disposed to do so. FIRING DOWN THE HATCHWAY. FIRING DOWN THE HATCHWAY. \"We got out of water, and the only way to reach what we had on board was by going down through the hold. Of course anybody who ventured there would be killed instantly; but we had the consolation of knowing that they could not get water any more than we could, as the place where it was stowed was fastened too securely for the coolies to open it with any tools they had on hand. We had a small condenser in the cook\u0027s galley, and with this we procured enough water to save us from death by thirst; but we refused to give a drop to the mutineers. \"They held out for two days, and during all that time hardly a man of us slept more than a few minutes at a stretch. Many of the coolies were suffering terribly with thirst and hunger, and they asked to have their wants supplied while they were making negotiations for peace. The captain refused anything but the most unconditional surrender, and the only concession he would grant was to have the dead bodies passed up to be thrown overboard. Of course the coolies were very glad of this, as they were suffering from the fearful condition of the narrow space where they were confined. When this work was completed, they asked for half[Pg 398] an hour\u0027s time to make a proposal for surrender, which was allowed them. THE WRITING IN BLOOD. THE WRITING IN BLOOD. \"Looking through the hatch, we could see them grouped together and engaged in earnest conversation. Two were dead or dying, and from one of them there was a stream of blood slowly oozing. A coolie who appeared to be a ringleader among them dipped his pen in the blood and wrote on a sheet of paper: \"\u0027We want three hundred coolies to be allowed on deck at a time. The ship must go back to the coast, and allow us to land at Whampoa, below Canton. We promise to make no trouble if this be done, but will burn the ship at once unless the captain agree to it.\u0027 \"We knew that any promise they made would not amount to anything when they were once in possession of the deck, and, besides, to go back to China would be a complete surrender of the voyage. The captain did not hesitate a moment in his answer to this demand. \"He opened one of the hatches just enough to allow one man to descend[Pg 399] at a time, and through this hole he compelled all the coolies who were then on deck to pass. Then he told the interpreters to say that they might burn the ship as soon as they liked, and the crew would leave in the boats. The boats were made ready for lowering; and, as we were not far from the coast, and the wind was fair, there was not much doubt of our getting safe to Hong-kong. Not a coolie would escape, and we should take good care that the fire would be so far advanced before we left that it could not be put out. \"In an hour we received another message, written in blood, like the first. It promised to deliver the ringleaders of the mutiny, to be kept in irons till we arrived at our destination, and also promised that there should be no more attempts to set fire to the ship. The captain was to fix the number of men to be on deck at one time, and they were to obey his orders without question. In fact, the surrender was complete. \"We had no trouble after that; but we only allowed fifty men on deck at one time, and those under a strong guard. You can be sure we were in a hurry to finish the voyage, which we did without accident. I had had all I wanted of the coolie-trade, and never went on another voyage like that.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2087/59205.html","bookId":528,"book":{"id":528,"title":"The Boy Travellers in the Far East","description":"简介： Not many years ago, China and Japan were regarded as among the barbarous nations.
