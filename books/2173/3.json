Let such madmen gain power - even you. Let such madmen act behind their conventional masks of sanity. Whether their masks be fashioned from the delusions of defense or the theological aura of law, war will come.\n - Gowachin aphorism\n The odalarm awoke Jorj X. McKie with a whiff of lemon. For just an instant his mind played tricks on him. He thought he was on Tutalsee\u0027s gentle planetary ocean floating softly on his garlanded island. There were lemons on his floating island, banks of Hibiscus and carpets of spicy Alyssum. His bowered cottage lay in the path of perfumed breezes and the lemon . . .\n Awareness came. He was not on Tutalsee with a loving companion; he was on a trained bedog in the armored efficiency of his Central Central apartment; he was back in the heart of the Bureau of Sabotage; he was back at work.\n McKie shuddered.\n A planet full of people could die today . . . or tomorrow.\n It would happen unless someone solved this Dosadi mystery. Knowing the Gowachin as he did, McKie was convinced of it. The Gowachin were capable of cruel decisions, especially where their species pride was at stake, or for reasons which other species might not understand. Bildoon, his Bureau chief, assessed this crisis the same way. Not since the Caleban problem had such enormity crossed the ConSentient horizon.\n But where was this endangered planet, this Dosadi?\n After a night of sleep suppression, the briefings about Dosadi came back vividly as though part of his mind had remained at work sharpening the images. Two operatives, one Wreave and one Laclac, had made the report. The two were reliable and resourceful. Their sources were excellent, although the information was sparse. The two also were bucking for promotion at a time when Wreaves and Laclacs were hinting at discrimination against their species. The report required special scrutiny. No BuSab agent, regardless of species, was above some internal testing, a deception designed to weaken the Bureau and gain coup merits upon which to ride into the director\u0027s office.\n However, BuSab was still directed by Bildoon, a PanSpechi in Human form, the fourth member of his creche to carry that name. It had been obvious from Bildoon\u0027s first words that he believed the report.\n \"McKie, this thing could set Human and Gowachin at each others\u0027 throats.\"\n It was an understandable idiom, although in point of fact you would go for the Gowachin abdomen to carry out the same threat. McKie already had acquainted himself with the report and, from internal evidence to which his long association with the Gowachin made him sensitive, he shared Bildoon\u0027s assessment. Seating himself in a grey chairdog across the desk from the director in the rather small, windowless office Bildoon had lately preferred, McKie shifted the report from one hand to the other. Presently, recognizing his own nervous mannerism, he put the report on the desk. It was on coded memowire which played to trained senses when passed through the fingers or across other sensitive appendages.\n \"Why couldn\u0027t they pinpoint this Dosadi\u0027s location?\" McKie asked.\n \"It\u0027s known only to a Caleban.\"\n \"Well, they\u0027ll . . .\"\n \"The Calebans refuse to respond.\"\n McKie stared across the desk at Bildoon. The polished surface reflected a second image of the BuSab director, an inverted image to match the upright one. McKie studied the reflection. Until you focused on Bildoon\u0027s faceted eyes (how like an insect\u0027s eyes they were), this PanSpechi appeared much like a Human male with dark hair and pleasant round face. Perhaps he\u0027d put on more than the form when his flesh had been molded to Human shape. Bildoon\u0027s face displayed emotions which McKie read in Human terms. The director appeared angry.\n McKie was troubled.\n \"Refused?\"\n \"The Calebans don\u0027t deny that Dosadi exists or that it\u0027s threatened. They refuse to discuss it.\"\n \"Then we\u0027re dealing with a Caleban contract and they\u0027re obeying the terms of that contract.\"\n Recalling that conversation with Bildoon as he awakened in his apartment, McKie lay quietly thinking. Was Dosadi some new extension of the Caleban Question?\n It\u0027s right to fear what we don\u0027t understand.\n The Caleban mystery had eluded ConSentient investigators for too long. He thought of his recent conversation with Fannie Mae. When you thought you had something pinned down, it slipped out of your grasp. Before the Calebans\u0027 gift of jumpdoors, the ConSentiency had been a relatively slow and understandable federation of the known sentient species. The universe had contained itself in a shared space of recognizable dimensions. The ConSentiency of those days had grown in a way likened to expanding bubbles. It had been linear.\n Caleban jumpdoors had changed that with an explosive acceleration of every aspect of life. Jumpdoors had been an immediately disruptive tool of power. They implied infinite usable dimensions. They implied many other things only faintly understood. Through a jumpdoor you stepped from a room on Tutalsee into a hallway here on Central Central. You walked through a jumpdoor here and found yourself in a garden on Paginui. The intervening \"normal space\" might be measured in light years or parsecs, but the passage from one place to the other ignored such old concepts. And to this day, ConSentient investigators did not understand how the jumpdoors worked. Concepts such as \"relative space\" didn\u0027t explain the phenomenon; they only added to the mystery.\n McKie ground his teeth in frustration. Calebans inevitably did that to him. What good did it do to think of the Calebans as visible stars in the space his body occupied? He could look up from any planet where a jumpdoor deposited him and examine the night sky. Visible stars: ah, yes. Those are Calebans. What did that tell him?\n There was a strongly defended theory that Calebans were but a more sophisticated aspect of the equally mysterious Taprisiots. The ConSentiency had accepted and employed Taprisiots for thousands of standard years. A Taprisiot presented sentient form and size. They appeared to be short lengths of tree trunk cut off at top and bottom and with oddly protruding stub limbs. When you touched them they were warm and resilient. They were fellow beings of the ConSentiency. But just as the Calebans took your flesh across the parsecs, Taprisiots took your awareness across those same parsecs to merge you with another mind.\n Taprisiots were a communications device.\n But current theory said Taprisiots had been introduced to prepare the ConSentiency for Calebans.\n It was dangerous to think of Taprisiots as merely a convenient means of communication. Equally dangerous to think of Calebans as \"transportation facilitators.\" Look at the socially disruptive effect of jumpdoors! And when you employed a Taprisiot, you had a constant reminder of danger: the communications trance which reduced you to a twitching zombie while you made your call. No . . . neither Calebans nor Taprisiots should be accepted without question.\n With the possible exception of the PanSpechi, no other species knew the first thing about Caleban and Taprisiot phenomena beyond their economic and personal value. They were, indeed, valuable, a fact reflected in the prices often paid for jumpdoor and long-call services. The PanSpechi denied that they could explain these things, but the PanSpechi were notoriously secretive. They were a species where each individual consisted of five bodies and only one dominant ego. The four reserves lay somewhere in a hidden creche. Bildoon had come from such a creche, accepting the communal ego from a creche-mate whose subsequent fate could only be imagined. PanSpechi refused to discuss internal creche matters except to admit what was obvious on the surface: that they could grow a simulacrum body to mimic most of the known species in the ConSentiency.\n McKie felt himself overcome by a momentary pang of xenophobia.\n We accept too damned many things on the explanations of people who could have good reasons for lying.\n Keeping his eyes closed, McKie sat up. His bedog rippled gently against his buttocks.\n Blast and damn the Calebans! Damn Fannie Mae!\n He\u0027d already called Fannie Mae, asking about Dosadi. The result had left him wondering if he really knew what Calebans meant by friendship.\n \"Information not permitted.\"\n What kind of an answer was that? Especially when it was the only response he could get.\n Not permitted?\n The basic irritant was an old one: BuSab had no real way of applying its \"gentle ministrations\" to the Calebans.\n But Calebans had never been known to lie. They appeared painfully, explicitly honest . . . as far as they could be understood. But they obviously withheld information. Not permitted! Was it possible they\u0027d let themselves be accessories to the destruction of a planet and that planet\u0027s entire population?\n McKie had to admit it was possible.\n They might do it out of ignorance or from some stricture of Caleban morality which the rest of the ConSentiency did not share or understand. Or for some other reason which defied translation. They said they looked upon all life as \"precious nodes of existence.\" But hints at peculiar exceptions remained. What was it Fannie Mae had once said?\n \"Dissolved well this node.\"\n How could you look at an individual life as a \"node\"?\n If association with Calebans had taught him anything, it was that understanding between species was tenuous at best and trying to understand a Caleban could drive you insane. In what medium did a node dissolve?\n McKie sighed.\n For now, this Dosadi report from the Wreave and Laclac agents had to be accepted on its own limited terms. Powerful people in the Gowachin Confederacy had sequestered Humans and Gowachin on an unlisted planet. Dosadi - location unknown, but the scene of unspecified experiments and tests on an imprisoned population. This much the agents insisted was true. If confirmed, it was a shameful act. The frog people would know that, surely. Rather than let their shame be exposed, they could carry out the threat which the two agents reported: blast the captive planet out of existence, the population and all of the incriminating evidence with it.\n McKie shuddered.\n Dosadi, a planet of thinking creatures - sentients. If the Gowachin carried out their violent threat, a living world would be reduced to blazing gases and the hot plasma of atomic particles. Somewhere, perhaps beyond the reach of other eyes, something would strike fire against the void. The tragedy would require less than a standard second. The most concise thought about such a catastrophe would require a longer time than the actual event.\n But if it happened and the other ConSentient species received absolute proof that it had happened . . . ahhh, then the ConSentiency might well be shattered. Who would use a jumpdoor, suspecting that he might be shunted into some hideous experiment? Who would trust a neighbor, if that neighbor\u0027s habits, language, and body were different from his own? Yes . . . there would be more than Humans and Gowachin at each other\u0027s throats. These were things all the species feared. Bildoon realized this. The threat to this mysterious Dosadi was a threat to all.\n McKie could not shake the terrible image from his mind: an explosion, a bright blink stretching toward its own darkness. And if the ConSentiency learned of it . . . in that instant before their universe crumbled like a cliff dislodged in a lightning bolt, what excuses would be offered for the failure of reason to prevent such a thing?\n Reason?\n McKie shook his head, opened his eyes. It was useless to dwell on the worst prospects. He allowed the apartment\u0027s sleep gloom to invade his senses, absorbed the familiar presence of his surroundings.\n I\u0027m a Saboteur Extraordinary and I\u0027ve a job to do.\n It helped to think of Dosadi that way. Solutions to problems often depended upon the will to succeed, upon sharpened skills and multiple resources. BuSab owned those resources and those skills.\n McKie stretched his arms high over his head, twisted his blocky torso. The bedog rippled with pleasure at his movements. He whistled softly and suffered the kindling of morning light as the apartment\u0027s window controls responded. A yawn stretched his mouth. He slid from the bedog and padded across to the window. The view stretched away beneath a sky like stained blue paper. He stared out across the spires and rooftops of Central Central. Here lay the heart of the domine planet from which the Bureau of Sabotage spread its multifarious tentacles.\n He blinked at the brightness, took a deep breath.\n The Bureau. The omnipresent, omniscient, omnivorous Bureau. The one source of unmonitored governmental violence remaining in the ConSentiency. Here lay the norm against which sanity measured itself. Each choice made here demanded utmost delicacy. Their common enemy was that never-ending sentient yearning for absolutes. And each hour of every waking workday, BuSab in all of its parts asked itself:\n \"What are we if we succumb to unbridled violence?\"\n The answer was there in deepest awareness:\n \"Then we are useless.\"\n ConSentient government worked because, no matter how they defined it, the participants believed in a common justice personally achievable. The Government worked because BuSab sat at its core like a terrible watchdog able to attack itself or any seat of power with a delicately balanced immunity. Government worked because there were places where it could not act without being chopped off. An appeal to BuSab made the individual as powerful as the ConSentiency. It all came down to the cynical, self-effacing behavior of the carefully chosen BuSab tentacles.\n I don\u0027t feel much like a BuSab tentacle this morning, McKie thought.\n In his advancing years, he\u0027d often experienced such mornings. He had a personal way of dealing with this mood: he buried himself in work.\n McKie turned, crossed to the baffle into his bath, where he turned his body over to the programmed ministrations of his morning toilet. The psyche-mirror on the bath\u0027s far wall reflected his body while it examined and adjusted to his internal conditions. His eyes told him he was still a squat, dark-skinned gnome of a Human with red hair, features so large they suggested an impossible kinship with the frog people of the Gowachin. The mirror did not reflect his mind, considered by many to be the sharpest legal device in the ConSentiency.\n The Daily Schedule began playing to McKie as he emerged from the bath. The DS suited its tone to his movements and the combined analysis of his psychophysical condition.\n \"Good morning, ser,\" it fluted.\n McKie, who could interpret the analysis of his mood from the DS tone, put down a flash of resentment. Of course he felt angry and concerned. Who wouldn\u0027t under these circumstances?\n \"Good morning, you dumb inanimate object,\" he growled. He slipped into a supple armored pullover, dull green and with the outward appearance of cloth.\n The DS waited for his head to emerge.\n \"You wanted to be reminded, ser, that there is a full conference of the Bureau Directorate at nine local this morning, but the . . .\"\n \"Of all the stupid . . .\" McKie\u0027s interruption stopped the DS. He\u0027d been meaning for some time to reprogram the damned thing. No matter how carefully you set them, they always got out of phase. He didn\u0027t bother to bridle his mood, merely spoke the key words in full emotional spate: \"Now you hear me, machine: don\u0027t you ever again choose that buddy-buddy conversational pattern when I\u0027m in this mood! I want nothing less than a reminder of that conference. When you list such a reminder, don\u0027t even suggest remotely that it\u0027s my wish. Understood?\"\n \"Your admonition recorded and new program instituted, ser.\" The DS adopted a brisk, matter of fact tone as it continued: \"There is a new reason for alluding to the conference.\"\n \"Well, get on with it.\"\n McKie pulled on a pair of green shorts and matching kilt, of armored material identical to that of the pullover.\n The DS continued:\n \"The conference was alluded to, ser, as introduction to a new datum: you have been asked not to attend.\"\n McKie, bending to fit his feet into self-powered racing boots, hesitated, then:\n \"But they\u0027re still going to have a showdown meeting with all the Gowachin in the Bureau?\"\n \"No mention of that, ser. The message was that you are to depart immediately this morning on the field assignment which was discussed with you. Code Geevee was invoked. An unspecified Gowachin Phylum has asked that you proceed at once to their home planet. That would be Tandaloor. You are to consult there on a problem of a legal nature.\"\n McKie finished fitting the boots, straightened. He could feel all of his accumulated years as though there\u0027d been no geriatric intervention. Geevee invoked a billion kinds of hell. It put him on his own with but one shopside backup facility: a Taprisiot monitor. He\u0027d have his own Taprisiot link sitting safely here on CC while he went out and risked his vulnerable flesh. The Taprisiot served only one function: to note his death and record every aspect of his final moments - every thought, every memory. This would be part of the next agent\u0027s briefing. And the next agent would get his own Taprisiot monitor etcetera, etcetera, etcetera . . . BuSab was notorious for gnawing away at its problems. The Bureau never gave up. But the astronomical cost of such a Taprisiot monitor left the operative so gifted with only one conclusion: odds were not in his favor. There\u0027d be no accolades, no cemetery rites for a dead hero . . . probably not even the physical substance of a hero for private grieving.\n McKie felt less and less heroic by the minute.\n Heroism was for fools and BuSab agents were not employed for their foolishness. He saw the reasoning, though. He was the best qualified non-Gowachin for dealing with the Gowachin. He looked at the nearest DS voder.\n \"Was it suggested that someone doesn\u0027t want me at that conference?\"\n \"There was no such speculation.\"\n \"Who gave you this message?\"\n \"Bildoon. Verified voiceprint. He asked that your sleep not be interrupted, that the message be given to you on awakening.\"\n \"Did he say he\u0027d call back or ask me to call him?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Did Bildoon mention Dosadi?\"\n \"He said the Dosadi problem is unchanged. Dosadi is not in my banks, ser. Did you wish me to seek more info . . .\"\n \"No! I\u0027m to leave immediately?\"\n \"Bildoon said your orders have been cut. In relationship to Dosadi, he said, and these are his exact words: \u0027The worst is probable. They have all the motivation required.\u0027 \"\n McKie ruminated aloud: \"All the motivation . . . selfish interest or fear. . .\"\n \"Ser, are you inquiring of . . .\"\n \"No, you stupid machine! I\u0027m thinking out loud. People do that. We have to sort things out in our heads, put a proper evaluation on available data.\"\n \"You do it with extreme inefficiency.\"\n This startled McKie into a flash of anger. \"But this job takes a sentient, a person, not a machine! Only a person can make the responsible decision. And I\u0027m the only agent who understands them sufficiently.\"\n \"Why not set a Gowachin agent to ferret out their . . .\"\n \"So you\u0027ve worked it out?\"\n \"It was not difficult, even for a machine. Sufficient clues were provided. And since you\u0027ll get a Taprisiot monitor, the project involves danger to your person. While I do not have specifics about Dosadi, the clear inference is that the Gowachin have engaged in questionable activity. Let me remind McKie that the Gowachin do not admit guilt easily. Very few non-Gowachin are considered by them to be worthy of their company and confidence. They do not like to feel dependent upon non-Gowachin. In fact, no Gowachin enjoys any dependent condition, not even when dependent upon another Gowachin. This is at the root of their law.\"\n This was a more emotionally loaded conversation than McKie had ever before heard from his DS. Perhaps his constant refusal to accept the thing on a personal anthropomorphic basis had forced it into this adaptation. He suddenly felt almost shy with the DS. What it had said was pertinent, and more than that, vitally important in a particular way: chosen to help him to the extent the DS was capable. In McKie\u0027s thoughts, the DS was suddenly transformed into a valued confidante.\n As though it knew his thoughts, the DS said:\n \"I\u0027m still a machine. You are inefficient, but as you have correctly stated you have ways of arriving at accuracy which machines do not understand. We can only . . . guess, and we are not really programmed to guess unless specifically ordered to do so on a given occasion. Trust yourself.\"\n \"But you\u0027d rather I were not killed?\"\n \"That is my program.\"\n \"Do you have any more helpful suggestions?\"\n \"You would be advised to waste as little time us possible here. There was a tone of urgency in Bildoon\u0027s voice.\"\n McKie stared at the nearest voder. Urgency in Bildoon\u0027s voice? Even under the most urgent necessity, Bildoon had never sounded urgent to McKie. Certainly, Dosadi could be an urgent matter, but . . . Why should that sound a sour note?\n \"Are you sure he sounded urgent?\"\n \"He spoke rapidly and with obvious tensions.\"\n \"Truthful?\"\n \"The tone-spikes lead to that conclusion.\"\n McKie shook his head. Something about Bildoon\u0027s behavior in this matter didn\u0027t ring true, but whatever it was it escaped the sophisticated reading circuits of the DS.\n And my circuits, too.\n Still troubled, McKie ordered the DS to assemble a full travel kit and to read out the rest of the schedule. He moved to the tool cupboard beside his bath baffle as the DS began reeling off the schedule.\n His day was to start with the Taprisiot appointment. He listened with only part of his attention, taking care to check the toolkit as the DS assembled it. There were plastipiks. He handled them gently as they deserved. A selection of stims followed. He rejected these, counting on the implanted sense/muscle amplifiers which increased the capabilities of senior BuSab agents. Explosives in various denominations went into the kit - raygens, pentrates. Very careful with these dangerous items. He accepted multilenses, a wad of uniflesh with matching mediskin, solvos, miniputer. The DS extruded a life-monitor bead for the Taprisiot linkage. He swallowed it to give the bead time to anchor in his stomach before the Taprisiot appointment. A holoscan and matching blanks were accepted, as were ruptors and comparators. He rejected the adapter for simulation of target identities. It was doubtful he\u0027d have time or facilities for such sophisticated refinements. Better to trust his own instincts.\n Presently, he sealed the kit in its wallet, concealed the wallet in a pocket. The DS had gone rambling on:\n \". . . and you\u0027ll arrive on Tandaloor at a place called Holy Running. The time there will be early afternoon.\"\n Holy Running!\n McKie riveted his attention to this datum. A Gowachin saying skittered through his mind: The Law is a blind guide, a pot of bitter water. The Law is a deadly contest which can change as waves change.\n No doubt of what had led his thoughts into that path. Holy Running was the place of Gowachin myth. Here, so their stories said, lived Mrreg, the monster who had set the immutable pattern of Gowachin character.\n And now, McKie suspected he knew which Gowachin Phylum had summoned him. It could be any one of five Phyla at Holy Running, but he felt certain it\u0027d be the worst of those five - the most unpredictable, the most powerful, the most feared. Where else could a thing such as Dosadi originate?\n McKie addressed his DS:\n \"Send in my breakfast. Please record that the condemned person ate a hearty breakfast.\"\n The DS, programmed to recognize rhetoric for which there was no competent response, remained silent while complying. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-3.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
