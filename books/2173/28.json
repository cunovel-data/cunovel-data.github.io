McKie, aware of the effort she was expending to conceal a deep weariness, watched her carefully. She concentrated on presenting a show of vitality, her attention glued on the prospect ahead. There was no way of telling what went on in her mind. McKie did not attempt to break the silence. He had his own worries.\\n\\n Which was the real Jedrik? How was she going to employ Pcharky? Could he resist her?\\n\\n He knew he was close to a solution of the Dosadi mystery, but the prospect of the twin gambles he was about to take filled him with doubts.\\n\\n On coming from the projection room, they\u0027d found themselves in a strange delaying situation, as though it were something planned for their frustration. Everything had been prepared for their movement - guards warned, elevator waiting, doors opened. But every time they thought the way clear, they met interference. Except for the obvious importance of the matters which delayed them, it was easy to imagine a conspiracy.\\n\\n A party of Gowachin at Gate Seventy wanted to surrender, but they demanded a parley first. One of Jedrik\u0027s aides didn\u0027t like the situation. Something about the assessment of the offer bothered her, and she wanted to discuss it with Jedrik. She stopped them halfway down the first hall outside the projection room.\\n\\n The aide was an older woman who reminded McKie vaguely of a Wreave lab worker at BuSab, one who\u0027d always been suspicious of computers, even antagonistic toward them. This Wreave had read every bit of history he could find about the evolution of such instruments and liked to remind his listeners of the misuses of the DemoPol. Human history had provided him with abundant ammunition, what with its periodic revolts against \"enslavement by machines.\" Once, he\u0027d cornered McKie.\\n\\n \"Look here! See this sign: \u0027Gigo.\u0027 That\u0027s a very old sign that was hung above one of your ancient computers. It\u0027s an acronym: \u0027Garbage In, Garbage Out.\u0027 You see! They knew.\"\\n\\n Yes. Jedrik\u0027s female aide reminded him of that Wreave.\\n\\n McKie listened to her worries. She roamed all around a central disquiet, never settling on a particular thing. Aware of Aritch\u0027s deadline and Jedrik\u0027s fatigue, McKie felt the pressures bearing down upon him. The aide\u0027s data was accurate. Others had checked it. Finally, he could hold his impatience no longer.\\n\\n \"Who fed this data into your computer?\"\\n\\n The aide was startled at the interruption, but Jedrik turned to him, waiting.\\n\\n \"I think it was Holjance,\" the aide said. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Get him in here.\"\\n\\n \"Her.\"\\n\\n \"Her, then! Make sure she\u0027s actually the one who fed in that data.\"\\n\\n Holjance was a pinch-faced woman with deep wrinkles around very bright eyes. Her hair was dark and wiry, skin almost the color of McKie\u0027s. Yes, she was the one who\u0027d fed the data into the computer because it had arrived on her shift, and she\u0027d thought it too important to delegate.\\n\\n \"What is it you want?\" she demanded.\\n\\n He saw no rudeness in this. It was Dosadi directness. Important things were happening all around. Don\u0027t waste time.\\n\\n \"You saw this assessment of the surrender offer?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Are you satisfied with it?\"\\n\\n \"The data went in correctly.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not my question.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027m satisfied!\"\\n\\n She stood ready to defend herself against any charge that she\u0027d slighted her job.\\n\\n \"Tell me, Holjance,\" he said, \"if you wanted the Gowachin computers to produce inaccurate assessments, what would you do?\"\\n\\n She thought about this a moment, blinked, glanced almost furtively at Jedrik who appeared lost in thought. \"Well, sir, we have a regular filtering procedure for preventing . . .\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" Jedrik said. \"If I were a Gowachin, I would not be doing that right now.\"\\n\\n Jedrik turned, barked orders to the guards behind her.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s another trap! Take care of it.\"\\n\\n As they emerged from the elevator on Jedrik\u0027s floor, there was another delay, one of the escort who\u0027d been with McKie at Gate Eighteen. His name was Todu Pellas and McKie addressed him by name, noting the faint betrayal of pleasure this elicited. Pellas, too, had doubts about carrying out a particular order.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re supposed to back up Tria\u0027s move by attacking across the upper parkway, but there are some trees and other growth knocked down up there that haven\u0027t been moved for two days.\"\\n\\n \"Who knocked down those trees?\" McKie asked.\\n\\n \"We did.\"\\n\\n McKie understood. You feinted. The Gowachin were supposed to believe this would provide cover for an attack, but there\u0027d been no attack for two days.\\n\\n \"They must be under pretty heavy strain,\" Jedrik said.\\n\\n McKie nodded. That, too, made sense. The alternative Gowachin assumption was that the Humans were trying to fake them into an attack at that point. But the cover had not been removed by either side for two days.\\n\\n Jedrik took a deep breath.\\n\\n \"We have superior firepower and when Tria . . . well. You should be able to cut right through there to . . .\"\\n\\n McKie interrupted.\\n\\n \"Call off that attack.\"\\n\\n \"But. . .\"\\n\\n \"Call it off!\"\\n\\n She saw the direction of his reasoning. Broey had learned much from the force which Gar and Tria had trained. And Jedrik herself had provided the final emphasis in the lesson. She saw there was no need to change her orders to Pellas.\\n\\n Pellas had taken it upon himself to obey McKie, not waiting for Jedrik\u0027s response, although she was his commander. He already had a communicator off his belt and was speaking rapidly into it.\\n\\n \"Yes! Dig in for a holding action.\"\\n\\n He spoke in an aside to Jedrik.\\n\\n \"I can handle it from here.\"\\n\\n In a few steps, Jedrik and McKie found themselves in her room. Jedrik leaned with her back against the door, no longer trying to conceal her fatigue.\\n\\n \"McKie, you\u0027re becoming very Dosadi.\"\\n\\n He crossed to the concealing panels, pulled out the bed.\\n\\n \"You need rest.\"\\n\\n \"No time.\"\\n\\n Yes, she knew all about the sixty-hour deadline - less than fifty-five hours now. Dosadi\u0027s destruction was a reaction she hadn\u0027t expected from \"X,\" and she blamed herself.\\n\\n He turned, studied her, saw that she\u0027d passed some previously defined limit of personal endurance. She possessed no amplifiers of muscles or senses, none of the sophisticated aids McKie could call upon in emergencies. She had nothing but her own magnificent mind and body. And she\u0027d almost run them out. Still, she pressed on. This told him a great deal about her motivation.\\n\\n McKie found himself deeply touched by the fact that she\u0027d not once berated him for hiding that ultimate threat which Aritch held over Dosadi. She\u0027d accepted it that someone in Aritch\u0027s position could erase an entire planet, that McKie had been properly maneuvered into concealing this.\\n\\n The alternative she offered filled McKie with misgivings.\\n\\n Exchange bodies?\\n\\n He understood now that this was Pcharky\u0027s function, the price the old Gowachin paid for survival. Jedrik had explained.\\n\\n \"He will perform this service one more time. In exchange, we release him from Dosadi.\"\\n\\n \"If he\u0027s one of the original . . . I mean, why doesn\u0027t he just leave?\"\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t provided him with a body he can use.\"\\n\\n McKie had suppressed a feeling of horror. But the history of Dosadi which Jedrik unfolded made it clear that a deliberate loophole had been left in the Caleban contract which imprisoned this planet. Fannie Mae had even said it. He could leave in another body. That was the basic purpose behind this experiment.\\n\\n New bodies for old!\\n\\n Aritch had expected this to be the ultimate enticement, luring McKie into the Gowachin plot, enlisting McKie\u0027s supreme abilities and his powerful position in BuSab.\\n\\n A new body for his old one.\\n\\n All he\u0027d have to do would be to cooperate in the destruction of a planet, conceal the real purpose of this project, and help set up another body-trade planet better concealed.\\n\\n But Aritch had not anticipated what might be created by Jedrik plus McKie. They now shared a particular hate and motivation.\\n\\n Jedrik still stood at the door waiting for him to decide.\\n\\n \"Tell me what to do,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure that you\u0027re willing to . . \".\\n\\n \"Jedrik!\"\\n\\n He thought he saw the beginning of tears. It wasn\u0027t that she hid them, but that they reached a suppression level barely visible and she defied them. She found her voice, pointed.\\n\\n \"That panel beside the bed. Pressure latch.\"\\n\\n The panel swung wide to reveal two shimmering rods about two centimeters in diameter. The rods danced with the energies of Pcharky\u0027s cage. They emerged from the floor, bent at right angles about waist height and, as the panel opened, they rotated to extend into the room - two glowing handles about a meter apart.\\n\\n McKie stared at them. He felt a tightness in his breast. What if he\u0027d misread Jedrik? Could he be sure of any Dosadi? This room felt as familiar to him now as his quarters on CC. It was here that Jedrik had taught him some of the most essential Dosadi lessons. Yet . . . he knew the old pattern of what she proposed. The discarded body with its donor ego had always been killed immediately. Why?\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have your answer to that question when we\u0027ve done this thing.\"\\n\\n A Dosadi response, ambiguous, heavy with alternatives.\\n\\n He glanced around the room, found it hard to believe that he\u0027d known this place only these few days. His attention returned to the shimmering rods. Another trap?\\n\\n He knew he was wasting precious time, that he\u0027d have to go through with this. But what would it be like to find himself in Jedrik\u0027s flesh, wearing her body as he now wore his own? PanSpechi transferred an ego from body to body. But something unspeakable which they would not reveal happened to the donor.\\n\\n McKie took a trembling breath.\\n\\n It had to be done. He and Jedrik shared a common purpose. She\u0027d had many opportunities to use Pcharky simply to escape or to extend her life . . . the way, he realized now, that Broey had used the Dosadi secret. The fact that she\u0027d waited for a McKie forced him to believe her. Jedrik\u0027s followers trusted her - and they were Dosadi. And if he and Jedrik escaped, Aritch would find himself facing a far different McKie from the one who\u0027d come so innocently across the Rim. They might yet stay Aritch\u0027s hand.\\n\\n The enticement had been real, though. No doubting that. Shed an old body, get a new one. And the Rim had been the major source of raw material: strong, resilient bodies. Survivors.\\n\\n \"What do I do?\" he asked.\\n\\n He felt a hand on his shoulder, and she spoke from beside him.\\n\\n \"You are very Dosadi, McKie. Astonishing.\"\\n\\n He glanced at her, saw what it had cost her to move here from the door. He slipped a hand around her waist, eased her to a sitting position on the bed and within reach of the rods.\\n\\n \"Tell me what to do.\"\\n\\n She stared at the rods, and McKie realized it was rage driving her, rage against Aritch, the embodiment of \"X,\" the embodiment of a contrived fate. He understood this. The solution of the Dosadi mystery had left him feeling empty, but on the edges there was such a rage as he\u0027d never before experienced. He was still BuSab, though. He wanted no more bloodshed because of Dosadi, no more Gowachin justifications.\\n\\n Jedrik\u0027s voice interrupted his thoughts and he saw that she also shared some of his misgivings.\\n\\n \"I come from a long line of heretics. None of us doubted that Dosadi was a crime, that somewhere there was a justice to punish the criminals.\"\\n\\n McKie almost sighed. Not the old Messiah dream! Not that! He would not fill that role, even for Dosadi.\\n\\n It was as though Jedrik read his mind. Perhaps, with that simulation model of him she carried in her head, this was exactly what she did.\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t expect a hero to come and save us. We knew that whoever came would suffer from the same deficiencies as the other non-Dosadi we saw here. You were so . . . slow. Tell me, McKie, what drives a Dosadi?\"\\n\\n He almost said, \"Power.\"\\n\\n She saw his hesitation, waited.\\n\\n \"The power to change your condition,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You make me very proud, McKie.\"\\n\\n \"But how did you know I was . . .\"\\n\\n \"McKie!\"\\n\\n He swallowed, then: \"Yes, I guess that was the easiest part for you.\"\\n\\n \"It was much more difficult finding your abilities and shaping you into a Dosadi.\"\\n\\n \"But I might\u0027ve been . . .\"\\n\\n \"Tell me how I did it, McKie.\"\\n\\n It was a test. He saw that. How had she known absolutely that he was the one she needed?\\n\\n \"I was sent here in a way that evaded Broey.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s not easy.\" Her glance flickered ceilingward. \"They tried to bait us from time to time. Havvy . . .\"\\n\\n \"Compromised, contaminated . . .\"\\n\\n \"Useless. Sometimes, a stranger looks out of Havvy\u0027s eyes.\"\\n\\n \"My eyes are my own.\"\\n\\n \"The first thing Bahrank reported about you.\"\\n\\n \"But even before that . . .\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"They used Havvy to tell you I was coming . . . and he told you that you could use my body. He had to be truthful with you up to a point. You could read Havvy! How clever they thought they were being! I had to be vulnerable . . . really vulnerable.\"\\n\\n \"The first thing . . .\"\\n\\n \". . . you found out about me.\" He nodded. \"Suspicions confirmed. All of that money on my person. Bait. I was someone to be eliminated. I was a powerful enemy of your enemies.\"\\n\\n \"And you were angered by the right things.\"\\n\\n \"You saw that?\"\\n\\n \"McKie, you people are so easy to read. So easy!\"\\n\\n \"And the weapons I carried. You were supposed to use those to destroy yourselves. The implications . . .\"\\n\\n \"I would\u0027ve seen that if I\u0027d had first-hand experience of Aritch. You knew what he intended for us. My mistake was to read your fears as purely personal. In time . . .\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re wasting time.\"\\n\\n \"You fear we\u0027ll be too late?\"\\n\\n Once more, he looked at the shimmering rods. What was it Pcharky did? McKie felt events rushing over him, engulfing him. What bargain had Jedrik really driven with Pcharky? She saw the question on his face.\\n\\n \"My people knew all along that Pcharky was just a tool of the God who held us prisoner. We forced a bargain on that God - that Caleban. Did you think we would not recognize the identity between the powers of that cage and the powers of our God Wall? No more delays, McKie. It\u0027s time to test our bargain.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-28.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \\n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
