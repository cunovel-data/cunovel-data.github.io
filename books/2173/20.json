He was a short Gowachin with pinched features, and he looked across the room to where Broey sat facing a dead communicator. There was a map on the wall behind the aide, its colors made brilliant by harsh morning light coming in the east windows. Below the map, a computer terminal jutted from the wall. Occasionally it clicked.\\n\\n Gar came into the room from the hall, peered around as though looking for someone, left.\\n\\n Broey noted the intrusion, glanced at the map.\\n\\n \"Still no sign of where she\u0027s gone to ground?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing certain.\"\\n\\n \"The one who paraded McKie through the streets . . .\"\\n\\n \"Clearly an expendable underling.\"\\n\\n \"Where did they go?\"\\n\\n The aide indicated a place on the map, a group of buildings in the Warrens to the northwest.\\n\\n Broey stared at the blank face of his communications screen. He\u0027d been tricked again. He knew it. That damnable Human female! Violence in the city teetered on the edge of full-scale war: Gowachin against Human. And still nothing, not even a hint at the location of Gar\u0027s Rim stores, the blasphemous factories. It was an unstable condition which could not continue much longer.\\n\\n His communications screen came alive with a report: violent fighting near Gate Twenty-One. Broey glanced at the map. That made it more than one hundred clearly defined battles between the species along an unresolved perimeter. The report spoke of new weapons and unsuccessful attempts to capture specimens.\\n\\n Gate Twenty-One?\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t far from the place where McKie had been paraded through . . .\\n\\n Several things slipped into a new relationship in Broey\u0027s mind. He looked at his aide, who stood waiting obediently at the map.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Gar?\"\\n\\n Aides were summoned, sent running. Gar was not to be found.\\n\\n \"Tria?\"\\n\\n She, too, was unavailable.\\n\\n Gar\u0027s fanatics remained neutral, but more of Jedrik\u0027s pattern was emerging. Everything pointed to an exquisite understanding of the weakness implicit in the behavior of Gar and Tria.\\n\\n And I thought I was the only one who saw that!\\n\\n Broey hesitated.\\n\\n Why would the God not speak to him other than to say \"I am watched.\"\\n\\n Broey felt tricked and betrayed in his innermost being. This had a cleansing effect on his reason. He could only depend on himself. And he began to sense a larger pattern in Jedrik\u0027s behavior. Was it possible that Jedrik shared his goals? The possibility excited him.\\n\\n He looked at the aides who\u0027d come running with the negative information about Gar and Tria, began to snap orders.\\n\\n \"Get our people out of all those Warrens, except that corridor to the northeast. Reinforce that area. Everyone else fall back to the secondary walls. Let no Humans inside that perimeter. Block all gates. Get moving!\"\\n\\n This last was shouted as his aides hesitated.\\n\\n Perhaps it already was too late. He realized now that he\u0027d allowed Jedrik to bait and distract him. It was clear that she\u0027d created in her mind an almost perfect simulation model of Broey. And she\u0027d done it from a Liaitor position! Incredible. He could almost feel sorry for Gar and Tria. They were like puppets dancing to Jedrik\u0027s strings.\\n\\n I was no better.\\n\\n It came over him that Jedrik\u0027s simulation probably encompassed this very moment of realization. Admiration for her permeated him.\\n\\n Superb!\\n\\n Quietly, he issued orders for the sequestering of Gowachin females within the inner Graluz bastions which he\u0027d had the foresight to prepare. His people would thank him for that.\\n\\n Those who survived the next few hours. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-20.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \\n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
