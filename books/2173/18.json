The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.\n - The Dosadi Lesson: A Gowachin Assessment\n Aritch studied Ceylang carefully in the soft light of his green-walled relaxation room. She had come down immediately after the evening meal, responsive to his summons. They both knew the reason for that summons: to discuss the most recent report concerning McKie\u0027s behavior on Dosadi.\n The old Gowachin waited for Ceylang to seat herself, observing how she pulled the red robe neatly about her lower extremities. Her features appeared composed, the fighting mandibles relaxed in their folds. She seemed altogether a figure of secure competence, a Wreave of the ruling classes - not that Wreaves recognized such classes. It disturbed Aritch that Wreaves tested for survival only through a complex understanding of sentient behavior, rigid performance standards based on ancient ritual, whose actual origins could only be guessed; there was no written record.\n But that\u0027s why we chose her.\n Aritch grunted, then:\n \"What can you say about the report?\"\n \"McKie learns rapidly.\"\n Her spoken Galach had a faint sibilance.\n Aritch nodded.\n \"I would say rather that he adapts rapidly. It\u0027s why we chose him.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard you say he\u0027s more Gowachin than the Gowachin.\"\n \"I expect him soon to be more Dosadi than the Dosadi.\"\n \"If he survives.\"\n \"There\u0027s that, yes. Do you still hate him?\"\n \"I have never hated him. You do not understand the spectrum of Wreave emotions.\"\n \"Enlighten me.\"\n \"He has violated my essential pride of self. This requires a specific reaction in kind. Hate would only dull my abilities.\"\n \"But I was the one who gave you the orders which had to be countermanded.\"\n \"My oath of service to the Gowachin contains a specific injunction, that I cannot hold any one of my teachers responsible for either understanding or obeying the Wreave protocols of courtesy. It is the same injunction which frees us to serve McKie\u0027s Bureau.\"\n \"You do not consider McKie one of your teachers?\"\n She studied him for a moment, then:\n \"Not only do I exclude him, but I know him to be one who has learned much about our protocols.\"\n \"What if I were to say he is one of your teachers?\"\n Again, she stared at him.\n \"I would revise my estimations of him - and of you.\"\n Aritch took a deep breath.\n \"Yet, you must learn McKie as though you lived in his skin. Otherwise, you will fail us.\"\n \"I will not fail you. I know the reasons you chose me. Even McKie will know in time. He dares not spill my blood in the Courtarena, or even subject me to public shame. Were he to do either of these things, half the Wreave universe would go hunting him with death in their mandibles.\"\n Aritch shook his head slowly from side to side.\n \"Ceylang! Didn\u0027t you hear him warn you that you must shed your Wreave skin?\"\n She was a long time responding and he noted the subtle characteristics which he\u0027d been told were the Wreave adjustments to anger: a twitching of the jowls, tension in the pedal bifurcations . . .\n Presently, she said:\n \"Tell me what that means, Teacher.\"\n \"You will be charged with performing under Gowachin Law, performing as though you were another McKie. He adapts! Haven\u0027t you observed this? He is capable of defeating you - and us - in such a way, in such a way that your Wreave universe would shower him with adulation for his victory. That cannot be permitted. Too much is at stake.\"\n Ceylang trembled and showed other signs of distress.\n \"But I am Wreave!\"\n \"If it comes to the Courtarena, you no longer can be Wreave.\"\n She inhaled several shallow breaths, composed herself.\n \"If I become too much McKie, aren\u0027t you afraid I might hesitate to slay him?\"\n \"McKie would not hesitate.\"\n She considered this.\n \"Then there\u0027s only one reason you chose me for this task.\"\n He waited for her to say it.\n \"Because we Wreaves are the best in the universe at learning the behavior of others - both overt and covert.\"\n \"And you dare not rely on any supposed inhibitions he may or may not have!\"\n After a long pause, she said:\n \"You are a better teacher than I\u0027d suspected. Perhaps you\u0027re even better than you suspected.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-18.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
