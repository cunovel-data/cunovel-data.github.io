Therefore, whoever presumes to judge must be asked: \"How are you affronted?\" And this judge must begin there to question inwardly as well as outwardly.\n - \"The Question\" from Ritual of the Courtarena Guide to Servants of the Box\n \"One might suspect you of trying to speak under water,\" McKie accused.\n He still sat opposite Aritch in the High Magister\u0027s sanctus, and this near-insult was only one indicator marking the changed atmosphere between them. The sun had dropped closer to the horizon and its spiritual ring no longer outlined Aritch\u0027s head. The two of them were being more direct now, if not more candid, having explored individual capacities and found where profitable discourse might be directed.\n The High Magister flexed his thigh tendons.\n Knowing these people from long and close observation, McKie realized the old Gowachin was in pain from prolonged inactivity. That was an advantage to be exploited. McKie held up his left hand, enumerated on his fingers:\n \"You say the original volunteers on Dosadi submitted to memory erasure, but many of their descendants are immune to such erasure. The present population knows nothing about our ConSentient Universe.\"\n \"As far as the present Dosadi population comprehends, they are the only people on the only inhabited planet in existence.\"\n McKie found this hard to believe. He held up a third finger.\n Aritch stared with distaste at the displayed hand.\n There were no webs between the alien fingers!\n McKie said, \"And you tell me that a DemoPol backed up by certain religious injunctions is the primary tool of government there?\"\n \"An original condition of our experiment,\" Aritch said.\n It was not a comprehensive answer, McKie observed. Original conditions invariably changed. McKie decided to come back to this after the High Magister had submitted to more muscle pain.\n \"Do the Dosadi know the nature of the Caleban barrier which encloses them?\"\n \"They\u0027ve tried rocket probes, primitive electromagnetic projections. They understand that those energies they can produce will not penetrate their \u0027God Wall.\u0027 \"\n \"Is that what they call the barrier?\"\n \"That or \u0027The Heavenly Veil.\u0027 To some degree, these labels measure their attitude toward the barrier.\"\n \"The DemoPol can serve many governmental forms,\" McKie said. \"What\u0027s the basic form of their government?\"\n Aritch considered this, then:\n \"The form varies. They\u0027ve employed some eighty different governmental forms.\"\n Another nonresponsive answer. Aritch did not like to face the fact that their experiment had assumed warlord trappings. McKie thought about the DemoPol. In the hands of adepts and with a population responsive to the software probes by which the computer data was assembled, the DemoPol represented an ultimate tool for manipulation of a populace. The ConSentiency outlawed its use as an assault on individual rights and freedoms. The Gowachin had broken this prohibition, yes, but a more interesting datum was surfacing: Dosadi had employed some eighty different governmental forms without rejecting the DemoPol. That implied frequent changes.\n \"How often have they changed their form of government?\"\n \"You can divide the numbers as easily as I,\" Aritch said. His tone was petulant.\n McKie nodded. One thing had become quite clear.\n \"Dosadi\u0027s masses know about the DemoPol, but you won\u0027t let them remove it!\"\n Aritch had not expected this insight. He responded with revealing sharpness which was amplified by his muscle pains.\n \"How did you learn that?\"\n \"You told me.\"\n \"I?\"\n \"Quite plainly. Such frequent change is responsive to an irritant - the DemoPol. They change the forms of government, but leave the irritant. Obviously, they cannot remove the irritant. That was clearly part of your experiment - to raise a population resistant to the DemoPol.\"\n \"A resistant population, yes,\" Aritch said. He shuddered.\n \"You\u0027ve fractured ConSentient Law in many places,\" McKie said.\n \"Does my Legum presume to judge me?\"\n \"No. But if I speak with a certain bitterness, please recall that I am a Human. I embrace a profound sympathy for the Gowachin, but I remain Human.\"\n \"Ahhhh, yes. We must not forget the long Human association with DemoPols.\"\n \"We survive by selecting the best decision makers,\" McKie said.\n \"And a DemoPol elevates mediocrity.\"\n \"Has that happened on Dosadi?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"But you wanted them to try many different governmental forms?\"\n The High Magister shrugged, remained silent.\n \"We Humans found that the DemoPol does profound damage to social relationships. It destroys preselected portions of a society.\"\n \"And what could we hope to learn by damaging our Dosadi society?\"\n \"Have we arrived back at the question of expected benefits?\"\n Aritch stretched his aching muscles.\n \"You are persistent, McKie. I will say that.\"\n McKie shook his head sadly.\n \"The DemoPol was always held up to us as the ultimate equalizer, a source of decision-making miracles. It was supposed to produce a growing body of knowledge about what a society really needed. It was thought to produce justice in all cases despite any odds.\"\n Aritch was irritated. He leaned forward, wincing at the pain of his old muscles.\n \"One might make the same accusations about the Law as practiced everywhere except on Gowachin worlds!\"\n McKie suppressed a sharp response. Gowachin training had forced him to question assumptions about the uses of law in the ConSentiency, about the inherent rightness of any aristocracy, any power bloc whether majority or minority. It was a BuSab axiom that all power blocs tended toward aristocratic forms, that the descendants of decision makers dominated the power niches. BuSab never employed offspring of their agents.\n Aritch repeated himself, a thing Gowachin seldom did.\n \"Law is delusion and fakery, McKie, everywhere except on the Gowachin worlds! You give your law a theological aura. You ignore the ways it injures your societies. Just as with the DemoPol, you hold up your law as the unvarying source of justice. When you . . .\"\n \"BuSab has . . .\"\n \"No! If something\u0027s wrong in your societies, what do you do? You create new law. You never think to remove law or disarm the law. You make more law! You create more legal professionals. We Gowachin sneer at you! We always strive to reduce the number of laws, the number of Legums. A Legum\u0027s first duty is to avoid litigation. When we create new Legums, we always have specific problems in mind. We anticipate the ways that laws damage our society.\"\n It was the opening McKie wanted.\n \"Why are you training a Wreave?\"\n Belatedly, Aritch realized he had been goaded into revealing more than he had wanted.\n \"You are good, McKie. Very good.\"\n \"Why?\" McKie persisted. \"Why a Wreave?\"\n \"You will learn why in time.\"\n McKie saw that Aritch would not expand on this answer, but there were other matters to consider now. It was clear that the Gowachin had trained him for a specific problem: Dosadi. To train a Wreave as Legum, they\u0027d have an equally important problem in mind . . . perhaps the same problem. A basic difference in the approach to law, species differentiated, had surfaced, however, and this could not be ignored. McKie well understood the Gowachin disdain for all legal systems, including their own. They were educated from infancy to distrust any community of professionals, especially legal professionals. A Legum could only tread their religious path when he completely shared that distrust.\n Do I share that distrust?\n He thought he did. It came naturally to a BuSab agent. But most of the ConSentiency still held its professional communities in high esteem, ignoring the nature of the intense competition for new achievements which invariably overcame such communities: new achievements, new recognition. But the new could be illusion in such communities because they always maintained a peer review system nicely balanced with peer pressures for ego rewards.\n \"Professional always means power,\" the Gowachin said.\n The Gowachin distrusted power in all of its forms. They gave with one hand and took with the other. Legums faced death whenever they used the Law. To make new law in the Gowachin Courtarena was to bring about the elegant dissolution of old law with a concomitant application of justice.\n Not for the first time, McKie wondered about the unknown problems a High Magister must face. It would have to be a delicate existence indeed. McKie almost formed a question about this, thought better of it. He shifted instead to the unknowns about Dosadi. God Wall? Heavenly Veil?\n \"Does Dosadi often accept a religious oligarchy?\"\n \"As an outward form, yes. They currently are presided over by a supreme Elector, a Gowachin by the name of Broey.\"\n \"Have Humans ever held power equal to Broey\u0027s?\"\n \"Frequently.\"\n It was one of the most responsive exchanges that McKie had achieved with Aritch. Although he knew he was following the High Magister\u0027s purpose, McKie decided to explore this.\n \"Tell me about Dosadi\u0027s social forms.\"\n \"They are the forms of a military organization under constant attack or threat of attack. They form certain cabals, certain power enclaves whose influences shift.\"\n \"Is there much violence?\"\n \"It is a world of constant violence.\"\n McKie absorbed this. Warlords. Military society. He knew he had just lifted a corner of the real issue which had brought the Gowachin to the point of obliterating Dosadi. It was an area to be approached with extreme caution. McKie chose a flanking approach.\n \"Aside from the military forms, what are the dominant occupations? How do they perceive guilt and innocence? What are their forms of punishment, of absolution? How do they . . .\"\n \"You do not confuse me, McKie. Consider, Legum: there are better ways to answer such questions.\"\n Brought up short by the Magister\u0027s chiding tone, McKie fell into silence. He glanced out the oval window, realizing he\u0027d been thrown onto the defensive with exquisite ease. McKie felt the nerves tingling along his spine. Danger! Tandaloor\u0027s golden sun had moved perceptibly closer to the horizon. That horizon was a blue-green line made hazy by kilometer after kilometer of hair trees whose slender female fronds waved and hunted in the air. Presently, McKie turned back to Aritch.\n Better ways to answer such questions.\n It was obvious where the High Magister\u0027s thoughts trended. The experimenters would, of course, have ways of watching their experiment. They could also influence their experiment, but it was obvious there were limits to this influence. A population resistant to outside influences? The implied complications of this Dosadi problem daunted McKie. Oh, the circular dance the Gowachin always performed!\n Better ways.\n Aritch cleared his ventricle passages with a harsh exhalation, then:\n \"Anticipating the possibility that others would censure us, we gave our test subjects the Primary.\"\n Devils incarnate! The Gowachin set such store on their damned Primary! Of course all people were created unequal and had to find their own level!\n McKie knew he had no choice but to plunge into the maelstrom.\n \"Did you also anticipate that you\u0027d be charged with violating sentient rights on a massive scale?\"\n Aritch shocked him by a brief puffing of jowls, the Gowachin shrug.\n McKie allowed himself a warning smile.\n \"I remind the High Magister that he raised the issue of the Primary.\"\n \"Truth is truth.\"\n McKie shook his head sharply, not caring what this revealed. The High Magister couldn\u0027t possibly have that low an estimation of his Legum\u0027s reasoning abilities. Truth indeed!\n \"I\u0027ll give you truth: the ConSentiency has laws on this subject to which the Gowachin are signatories!\"\n Even as the words fell from his lips, McKie realized this was precisely where Aritch had wanted him to go. They\u0027ve learned something from Dosadi! Something crucial!\n Aritch massaged the painful muscles of his thighs, said, \"I remind you, Legum, that we peopled Dosadi with volunteers.\"\n \"Their descendants volunteered for nothing!\"\n \"Ancestors always volunteer their descendants - for better or for worse. Sentient rights? Informed consent? The ConSentiency has been so busy building law upon law, creating its great illusion of rights, that you\u0027ve almost lost sight of the Primary\u0027s guiding principle: to develop our capacities. People who are never challenged never develop survival strengths!\"\n Despite the perils, McKie knew he had to press for the answer to his original question: benefits.\n \"What\u0027ve you learned from your monster?\"\n \"You\u0027ll soon have a complete answer to that question.\"\n Again, the implication that he could actually watch Dosadi. But first it\u0027d be well to disabuse Aritch of any suspicion that McKie was unaware of the root implications. The issue had to be met head on.\n \"You\u0027re not going to implicate me.\"\n \"Implicate you?\" There was no mistaking Aritch\u0027s surprise.\n \"No matter how you use what you\u0027ve learned from Dosadi, you\u0027ll be suspected of evil intent. Whatever anyone learns from . . .\"\n \"Oh, that. New data gives one power.\"\n \"And you do not confuse me, Aritch. In the history of every species there are many examples of places where new data has been gravely abused.\"\n Aritch accepted this without question. They both knew the background. The Gowachin distrusted power in all of its forms, yet they used power with consummate skill. The trend of McKie\u0027s thoughts lay heavily in this room now. To destroy Dosadi would be to hide whatever the Gowachin had learned there. McKie, a non-Gowachin, therefore, would learn these things, would share the mantle of suspicion should it be cast. The historical abuses of new data occurred between the time that a few people learned the important thing and the time when that important thing became general knowledge. To the Gowachin and to BuSab it was the \"Data Gap,\" a source of constant danger.\n \"We would not try to hide what we\u0027ve learned,\" Aritch said, \"only how we learned it.\"\n \"And it\u0027s just an academic question whether you destroy an entire planet and every person on it!\"\n \"Ahh, yes: academic. What you don\u0027t know, McKie, is that one of our test subjects on Dosadi has initiated, all on her own, a course of events which will destroy Dosadi very quickly whether we act or not. You\u0027ll learn all about this very soon when, like the good Legum we know you to be, you go there to experience this monster with your own flesh.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-9.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
