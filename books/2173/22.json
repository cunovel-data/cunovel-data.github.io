This is the road to chaos.\n - PanSpechi aphorism\n By the fourth morning of the battle for Chu, Tria was in a vile humor. Her forces had established lines holding about one-eighth of the total Warren territory, mostly low buildings, except along Broey\u0027s corridor to the Rim. She did not like the idea that Jedrik\u0027s people held an unobstructed view down onto most of the death fanatics\u0027 territory. And most of those leaders who\u0027d thrown in their lot with Tria were beginning to have second thoughts, especially since they\u0027d come to realize that this enclave had insufficient food production facilities to maintain itself. The population density she\u0027d been forced to accept was frightening: almost triple the Warren norm.\n Thus far, neither Broey nor Jedrik had moved in force against her. Tria had finally been brought to the inescapable conclusion that she and Gar were precisely where Jedrik wanted them. They\u0027d been cut out of Broey\u0027s control as neatly and cleanly as though by a knife. There was no going back. Broey would never accept Human help under present circumstance. That, too, spoke of the exquisite care with which Jedrik had executed her plan.\n Tria had moved her command post during the night to a high building which faced the canyon walls to the north. Only the river, with a single gate under it, separated her from the Rim. She\u0027d slept badly, her mind full of worries. Chief among her worries was the fact that none of the contact parties she\u0027d sent out to the Rim had returned. There\u0027d been no fires on the Rim ledges during the night. No word from any of her people out there.\n Why?\n Once more, she contemplated her position, seeking some advantage, any advantage. One of her lines was anchored on Broey\u0027s corridor to the Rim, one line on the river wall with its single gate, and the rest of her perimeter meandered through a series of dangerous salients from the fifth wall to the river.\n She could hear sounds of battle along the far side of Broey\u0027s corridor. Jedrik\u0027s people used weapons which made a great deal of noise. Occasionally, an explosive projectile landed in Tria\u0027s enclave. These were rare, but she\u0027d taken casualties and the effect on morale was destructive. That was a major problem with fanatics: they demanded to be used, to be wasted.\n Tria stared down at the river, aware of the bodies drifting on its poison currents - both Human and Gowachin bodies, but more Gowachin than Human. Presently, she turned away from the scene, padded into the next room, and roused Gar.\n \"We must contact Jedrik,\" she said.\n He rubbed sleep from his eyes.\n \"No! We must wait until we make contact with our people on the Rim. Then we can . . .\"\n \"Faaaaa!\"\n She\u0027d seldom showed that much disgust with him.\n \"We\u0027re not going to make contact with our people on the Rim. Jedrik and Broey have seen to that. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me if they were cooperating to isolate us.\"\n \"But we\u0027ve . . .\"\n \"Shut up, Father!\" She held up her hands, stared at them. \"I was never really good enough to be one of Broey\u0027s chief advisors. I always suspected that. I always pressed too hard. Last night, I reviewed as many of my decisions as I could. Jedrik deliberately made me look good. She did it oh so beautifully!\"\n \"But our forces on the Rim . . .\"\n \"May not be ours! They may be Jedrik\u0027s.\"\n \"Even the Gowachin?\"\n \"Even the Gowachin.\"\n Gar could hear a ringing in his ears. Contact Jedrik? Throw away all of their power?\n \"I\u0027m good enough to recognize the weakness of a force such as ours,\" Tria said. \"We can be goaded into spending ourselves uselessly. Even Broey didn\u0027t see that, but Jedrik obviously did. Look at the salients along her perimeter!\"\n \"What have salients . . .\"\n \"They can be pinched off and obliterated! Even you must see that.\"\n \"Then pull back and . . .\"\n \"Reduce our territory?\" She stared at him, aghast. \"If I even intimate I\u0027m going to do that, our auxiliaries will desert wholesale. Right now they\u0027re . . .\"\n \"Then attack!\"\n \"To gain what?\"\n Gar nodded. Jedrik would fall back across mined areas, blast the fanatics out of existence. She held enough territory that she could afford such destruction. Clearly, she\u0027d planned on it.\n \"Then we must pinch off Broey\u0027s corridor.\"\n \"That\u0027s what Jedrik wants us to do. It\u0027s the only negotiable counter we have left. That\u0027s why we must contact Jedrik.\"\n Gar shook his head in despair.\n Tria was not finished, though.\n \"Jedrik might restore us to a share of power in the Rim city if we bargain for it now. Broey would never do that. Do you understand now the mistake you made with Broey?\"\n \"But Broey was going to . . .\"\n \"You failed to follow my orders, Father. You must see now why I always tried to keep you from making independent decisions.\"\n Gar fell into abashed silence. This was his daughter, but he could sense his peril.\n Tria spoke.\n \"I will issue orders presently to all of our commanders. They will be told to hold at all costs. They will be told that you and I will try to contact Jedrik. They will be told why.\"\n \"But how can . . .\"\n \"We will permit ourselves to be captured.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-22.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
