{"id":99187,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"In the name of all that we together hold holy I promise three things to the sacred congregation of people who are subject to my rule. In the first place, that the holy religion which we mutually espouse shall always preserve their freedom under my auspices; secondly, that I will temper every form of rapacity and inequity which may inflict itself upon us all; and thirdly, that I will command swift mercy in all judgments, that to me and to you the gracious Lord may extend His Recognition.\n - The Oath of Power, Dosadi Sacred Congregation papers\n Broey arose from prayer, groped behind him for the chair, and sank into it. Enclosed darkness surrounded him. The room was a shielded bubble attached to the bottom of his Graluz. Around the room\u0027s thick walls was the warm water which protected his females and their eggs. Access to the bubble was through a floor hatch and a twisting flooded passage from the Graluz. Pressure in the bubble excluded the water, but the space around Broey smelled reassuringly of the Graluz. This helped reinforce the mood he now required.\n Presently, the God spoke to him. Elation filled Broey. God spoke to him, only to him. Words hissed within his head. Scenes impinged themselves upon his vision centers.\n Yes! Yes! I keep the DemoPol!\n God was reassured and reflected that reassurance.\n Today, God showed him a ritual Broey had never seen before. The ritual was only for Gowachin. The ritual was called Laupuk. Broey saw the ritual in all of its gory details, felt the rightness of it as though his very cells accepted it.\n Responsibility, expiation - these were the lessons of Laupuk. God approved when Broey expressed understanding.\n They communicated by words which Broey expressed silently in his thoughts, but there were other thoughts which God could not perceive. Just as God no doubt held thoughts which were not communicated to Broey. God used people, people used God. Divine intervention with cynical overtones. Broey had learned the Elector\u0027s role through a long and painful apprenticeship.\n I am your servant, God.\n As God admonished, Broey kept the secret of his private communion. It suited his purpose to obey, as it obviously suited God\u0027s purpose. There were times, though, when Broey wanted to shout it:\n \"You fools! I speak with the voice of God!\"\n Other Electors had made that mistake. They\u0027d soon fallen from the seat of power. Broey, drawing on several lifetimes of assembled experiences, knew he must keep this power if he ever were to escape from Dosadi.\n Anyway, the fools did his bidding (and therefore God\u0027s) without divine admonition. All was well. One presented a selection of thoughts to God . . . being careful always where and when one reviewed private thoughts. There were times when Broey felt God within him when there\u0027d been no prayer, no preparations here in the blackness of this bubble room. God might peer out of Broey\u0027s eyes at any time - softly, quietly - examining His world and its works through mortal senses.\n \"I guard My servant well.\"\n The warmth of reassurance which flowed through Broey then was like the warmth of the Graluz when he\u0027d still been a tad clinging to his mother\u0027s back. It was a warmth and sense of safety which Broey tempered with a deep awareness of that other Graluz time: a giant grey-green adult male Gowachin ravening through the water, devouring those tads not swift enough, alert enough to escape.\n I was one of the swift.\n Memory of that plunging, frantic flight in the Graluz had taught Broey how to behave with God.\n In his bubble room\u0027s darkness, Broey shuddered. Yes, the ways of God were cruel. Thus armed, a servant of God could be equally cruel, could surmount the fact that he knew what it was to be both Human and Gowachin. He need only be the pure servant of God. This thought he shared.\n Beware, McKie. God has told me whence you come. I know your intentions. Hold fast to the narrow path, McKie. You risk my displeasure. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-10.html","bookId":2173,"book":{"id":2173,"title":"The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dosadi Experiment (ConSentiency Universe #2) \n Generations of a tormented human-alien people, caged on a toxic planet, conditioned by constant hunger and war-this is the Dosadi Experiment, and it has succeeded too well.
