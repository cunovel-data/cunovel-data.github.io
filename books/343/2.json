{"id":12491,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. MR. AND MRS. FOGSON.","content":"Mr. Fogson was about as unpleasant-looking as his wife, but was not so thin. He had stiff red hair with a tendency to stand up straight, a blotched complexion, and red eyes, corresponding very well with the color of his hair. He was quite as cross as his wife, but she was more venomous and malicious. Like her he was disposed to fawn upon Squire Dixon, the Overseer of the Poor, with whom he knew it was necessary to stand well. Had Jed come alone he might have met with a disagreeable reception; but Mr. Fogson\u0027s quick eye recognized in his companion the son of the poorhouse autocrat, Squire Dixon, and he summoned up an ingratiating smile on his rugged features. \"How are you, Master Percy?\" he said smoothly. \"Did your pa come with you?\" [Pg 12] \"Yes, he\u0027s over to the house. Mrs. Fogson wants you to go right home, as he may want to see you.\" \"All right! It will give me pleasure. It always does me good to see your pa.\" Percy looked at him critically, and thought that Mr. Fogson was about as homely a man as he had ever seen. It was fortunate that the keeper of the poorhouse could not read his thoughts, for, like most ugly men, Mr. Fogson thought himself on the whole rather prepossessing. Fogson took his place beside Percy, and curtly desired Jed to walk behind. Jed smiled to himself, for he understood that Mr. Fogson considered him not entitled to a place in such superior company. Mr. Fogson addressed several questions to Percy, which the latter answered languidly, as if he considered it rather a bore to be entertained by a man in Fogson\u0027s position. Indeed he almost snubbed him, and Jed was pleased to find the man who made so many unpleasant speeches to others treated in the same manner himself. As a general thing, a[Pg 13] man who bullies others has to take his turn in being bullied himself. Meanwhile Mrs. Fogson was chatting with Squire Dixon. \"Nobody can tell what I have to put up with from them paupers,\" she said. \"You\u0027d actilly think they paid their board by the way they talk. The fact is, the Averys pampered and indulged them altogether too much.\" \"That is so, Mrs. Fogson,\" said the squire pompously, \"and that, I may remark, was the reason I dismissed them from their responsible position. Do they—ahem!—complain of anything in particular?\" \"Why, they want butter every day!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fogson. \"Think of it! Butter every day for paupers!\" \"As you justly observe, this is very unreasonable. And how often do you give them butter?\" \"Once a week—on Sundays.\" \"Very judicious. It impresses them with the difference between Sunday and other days. It shows your religious training, Mrs. Fogson.\" [Pg 14] \"I always aim to be religious, Squire Dixon,\" said Mrs. Fogson meekly. \"Well, and what else?\" \"Likewise the old people expect tea every day. They say Mrs. Avery gave it to them.\" \"I dare say she did. It\u0027s an imposition on the town to spend their—ahem!—hard-earned money on such luxuries.\" \"That\u0027s the way I look at it, Squire Dixon.\" \"How often do you give them meat?\" \"Every other day. I get the cheapest cuts from the butcher—what he has left over. But they ain\u0027t satisfied. They want it every day.\" \"Shocking!\" exclaimed the squire, arching his brows. \"So I say. Of course I get a good many sour looks, and more complaints, but I tell \u0027em that if they ain\u0027t suited with their boarding-house they can go somewhere else.\" \"Very good! Very good indeed; ha, ha! I presume none of them have left the poorhouse in consequence?\" \"No, but one has threatened to do so.\" [Pg 15] \"Who is that?\" asked Squire Dixon quickly. \"The boy Jed.\" \"Oh, yes, he was the one who opened the gate for me. Now, what sort of a boy is he, Mrs. Fogson?\" \"He\u0027s an impudent young jackanapes,\" answered Mrs. Fogson spitefully, \"begging your pardon for using such an inelegant expression.\" \"It is forcible, however, Mrs. Fogson. It is forcible, and I think you are quite justified in using it. So he is impudent?\" \"Yes; you\u0027d think, by the airs he puts on, that he owned the poorhouse, instead of being a miserable pauper. Why, I venture to say he considers himself the equal of your son, Master Percy.\" \"No, no, Mrs. Fogson, that is a little too strong. He couldn\u0027t be so absurd as that.\" \"I am not so sure of that, Squire Dixon. There is no end to that boy\u0027s impudence and—and uppishness. Why, he said the other day that the meat wasn\u0027t fit for the hogs.\" [Pg 16] \"And was it, Mrs. Fogson?\" asked the squire in an absent-minded way. \"To be sure, squire, though I must admit that it was a trifle touched, being warm weather; but paupers can\u0027t expect first-class hotel fare—can they, now, squire?\" \"To be sure not.\" \"Then, again, Jed is always praising up Mr. and Mrs. Avery, which, as you can imagine, isn\u0027t very pleasant for Mr. Fogson and me. I expect he was Mr. Avery\u0027s pet, from all I hear.\" \"Very likely he was. He was brought to the poorhouse when a mere baby, and they took care of him from his infancy. I\u0027ve heard Mrs. Avery say she looked upon him as if he were her own child.\" \"And that is why she pampered him—at the town\u0027s expense.\" \"As you truly observe, at the town\u0027s expense. I am sure you and Mr. Fogson will feel it your duty to make the poorhouse as inexpensive as possible to the town, bearing in mind the great responsibility that has devolved upon you.\" [Pg 17] \"Of course, squire, me and Fogson bear that in mind, but we ain\u0027t paid any too well for our hard labor.\" \"That reminds me, Mrs. Fogson, another month has rolled by, and——\" \"I understand, squire,\" said Mrs. Fogson. \"I have got it all ready,\" and she drew a sealed envelope out of her pocket and passed it to the squire, who pocketed it with a deprecatory cough. His face brightened up, for he knew what the envelope contained. \"You can depend on me to use my official influence in your favor, Mrs. Fogson,\" he said cheerfully. \"As long as you show a proper appreciation of my service in giving you the place, I will stand by you.\" Squire Dixon was a rich man. He was paid by the town for his services as overseer, yet he was not above accepting five dollars a month from the man he had installed in office. He had never distinctly asked for it, but he had hinted in a manner not to be mistaken that it would be politic for Mr. Fogson to allow him a percentage on their salary and profits. They got the money back, and more,[Pg 18] for in auditing their accounts he did not scrutinize too closely the prices they claimed to have paid for supplies. It was an arrangement mutually advantageous, which had never occurred to Mr. and Mrs. Avery, who in their scrupulous honesty were altogether behind the times, according to the squire\u0027s thinking. \"And how many paupers have you in the house at present, Mrs. Fogson?\" asked the overseer. \"Nineteen, squire. Would you like to look at them?\" \"Well, perhaps in my official capacity it would be as well.\" \"Come in here, then,\" and Mrs. Fogson led the way into a large room where sat the paupers, a forlorn, unhappy-looking company. Two of the old ladies were knitting; one young woman, who had lost her child, and with it her mind, was fondling a rag baby; two were braiding a rag carpet, and others were sitting with vacant faces, looking as if life had no attraction for them. \"Will you address them, squire?\" asked Mrs. Fogson. \"Ahem!\" said the squire, straightening up and looking around him with the air of a benignant father. \"I will say a few words.\" \"Attention all!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fogson in a sharp voice. \"Squire Dixon has consented to make a few remarks. I hope you will appreciate your privilege in hearing him.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82155.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
