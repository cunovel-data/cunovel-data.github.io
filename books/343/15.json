{"id":12504,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. TWO ODD ACQUAINTANCES.","content":"\"Ten dollars a week!\" repeated Harry Bertram, to who Jed communicated his good luck. \"Why, that is famous!\" \"Ten dollars a week and my meals!\" \"Better still. That is better than acting.\" \"I don\u0027t know how I shall suit Mr. Holbrook.\" \"You will suit him if you suit the boy.\" By this time Chester made his appearance. \"I want to walk on the beach,\" he said. \"Come, Jed.\" And the boy put his hand confidingly in that of Jed. They descended the steps that led from the bluff to the beach, and walked leisurely up and down on the sand. Presently Chester expressed a wish to sit down, and before long was engaged with a small wooden spade in making a sand fortification. [Pg 136] Relieved from duty, since his young charge could come to no harm, Jed had leisure to watch the crowds passing him in both directions. Presently a thin, dark-complexioned man, of perhaps thirty-five, after walking up and down the beach, came to a stop, and, apparently without motive, seated himself on the sand beside Chester and his youthful guardian. \"A pleasant day,\" he remarked, looking at Jed. \"Yes,\" answered Jed politely. He was not favorably impressed by the stranger\u0027s appearance, but recognized the claims of courtesy. \"Is this little boy your brother?\" \"No,\" answered Jed. \"I thought perhaps you brought him down to the beach.\" \"I did.\" \"I have seen him about before—with a girl.\" \"That was Clara, my old nurse,\" said Chester, who caught the drift of the conversation.[Pg 137] \"I haven\u0027t got any nurse now,\" he added proudly. \"I saw you talking to Clara one day,\" he added, after a closer examination of the stranger\u0027s features. \"Oh, no, my little boy!\" said the man, seeming annoyed. \"I don\u0027t know Clara, as you call her.\" \"Then you look just like the man that was talking with her.\" The stranger opened his mouth and smiled unpleasantly. \"I dare say there are people that look like me,\" he said, \"though I can\u0027t say I ever met one. What is your name, my little friend?\" \"I am not your friend,\" said Chester, who did not appear favorably impressed by his new acquaintance. \"My little enemy, then.\" \"My name is Chester Holbrook.\" \"And how old are you?\" \"Ten years old. How old are you?\" Again the man\u0027s lips opened in an unpleasant smile. \"You have an inquiring mind, Chester,\" he said. \"I am—thirty years old.\" [Pg 138] \"You look older than that.\" \"I am afraid that is not polite, Chester,\" said Jed gently. \"Why isn\u0027t it?\" asked Chester innocently. \"People don\u0027t like to be thought older than they are.\" \"Oh, never mind,\" said the dark man. \"A child is licensed to say what he pleases. So he is your charge?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I don\u0027t think I have seen you here before. Have you known Mr. Holbrook long?\" \"No.\" Then upon the impulse of the moment Jed inquired, \"Do you know him?\" The man\u0027s face changed, and he looked a shade embarrassed. \"Why do you think I know him?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t think it, but as you seemed interested in the boy, I asked you the question.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s it. I have seen Mr. Holbrook, and I may have spoken to him. I can\u0027t be sure on the subject, as I meet a good many people. Are you going in bathing?\" \"Do you want to bathe, Chester?\" asked Jed. [Pg 139] \"No; papa told me not to go to-day, as I have a cold.\" \"I thought perhaps I would have had your company in the surf. Well, I must be going or I shall be late for the bath.\" The stranger got up slowly and sauntered away. \"I don\u0027t like that man. Do you, Jed?\" asked Chester. \"Not very much. I never saw him before.\" \"I have seen him. I saw him one day last week.\" \"Did you see him on the beach?\" \"Yes; he came up and talked with Clara.\" \"But he said you were mistaken about that.\" \"I was not mistaken,\" said Chester positively. \"I remember him very well.\" \"Do you remember what he was talking about?\" asked Jed, struck by what the boy said. \"Yes; he was asking questions about me.\" \"He seems a good deal interested in you. Perhaps he is especially fond of small boys.\" Chester shook his head. [Pg 140] \"I don\u0027t think he is,\" he answered. When the bathing hour was over they ascended the steps and took seats in a summer house on the bluff. Ten minutes later a tall woman, with piercing black eyes and a swarthy complexion, entered the arbor and sat down beside them. \"Do you want your fortune told?\" she asked of Jed. He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t believe in fortune-tellers,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t you? Let me convince you of my power. Give me your hand.\" There seemed a fascination about the woman, and almost involuntarily he suffered her to take his hand. \"You look prosperous,\" she began abruptly, \"but your life has been full of poverty and privation. Is this true?\" \"Yes,\" answered Jed, impressed in spite of himself by the woman\u0027s words. \"Shall I tell you where your early years were passed?\" \"No,\" answered Jed, with a quick look at Chester. He did not care to have the boy[Pg 141] hear that his life had been passed in the Scranton poorhouse. \"You are right. The knowledge could do no good and might embarrass you. You admit that I have told the truth?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then shall I tell you of the future?\" Jed did not answer, but the woman took his assent for granted and went on. \"You will be rich—some day.\" \"Shall I? I am glad to hear that. But I don\u0027t know where the wealth is to come from.\" \"It is not necessary for you to know. It will be enough if it comes.\" \"I agree with you there,\" said Jed, smiling. \"Will it be soon?\" \"That is a question which I might answer, but I will not.\" \"I don\u0027t care to know, as long as I am to be prosperous some day. Shall I ever go back to—to the place where my earlier years were passed?\" \"You may, but not to live. That part of your life is over.\" [Pg 142] \"I am glad of that at any rate. One question more. Shall I meet my—any one belonging to me—any one to whom I am related?\" Jed fixed his eyes anxiously upon the fortune-teller, for skeptical as he was at first, he was beginning to have some confidence in her claims to knowledge. \"Yes.\" \"When?\" \"Don\u0027t seek to know more. Let me look at this boy\u0027s hand. Do you want me to tell your fortune, my pretty?\" Chester laughed. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Perhaps you can tell me if I will ever be a soldier. I would like to be a General.\" \"No; you will never be a soldier, but you will have a fight before you.\" \"A fight? What kind of a fight?\" The fortune-teller turned to Jed and said rapidly, \"This boy is threatened with a serious danger. He has an enemy.\" \"How can a young boy have an enemy?\" \"There are few who do not have enemies,\" said the woman sententiously. [Pg 143] \"Can you describe the enemy?\" \"He is a dark man, not tall, but taller than you. He is thin.\" \"I met such a man on the beach,\" said Jed, surprised. \"I met him only this morning. Is he the one you mean?\" \"When you meet such a man beware of him!\" said the woman, and without waiting for a reply she rose from her seat and walked away rapidly. \"What a funny old woman!\" said Chester. \"I am hungry. Let us go up to the hotel. It is time for lunch.\" Jed\u0027s face became thoughtful. What he had heard left a deep impression upon his mind.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82168.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
