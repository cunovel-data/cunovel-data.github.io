{"id":12514,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. WITHOUT A PENNY.","content":"There is nothing that makes one feel so helpless as to be without a penny in a strange city. If Jed had had even a dollar he would have felt better. The fact of his poverty was emphasized when a boy came up to him and asked him to buy a morning paper. Jed instinctively felt in his pocket for a penny, but not even a cent was forthcoming. \"I have no change,\" he said, by way of excuse. \"I can change a dollar,\" responded the newsboy, who was more than usually enterprising. \"I wish I could,\" thought Jed, but he only said, \"No, it is no matter.\" So he walked along Broadway, fairly well dressed, but, so far as money went, a pauper. Yes, though no longer an inmate of the [Pg 223]Scranton poorhouse, he was even poorer than when he was there, for then he had a home, and now he had none. \"I wonder when it is all going to end?\" reflected poor Jed despondently. Then his anger was excited when he thought of the unprincipled rascal who had brought him to this pass. \"If I could only get hold of him,\" muttered Jed vengefully, \"I would give him something to remember me by.\" All the while Jed walked on, though his walk was aimless. He was as well off in one part of the city as another, and only walked to fill up time. He found himself passing a drug store. Just outside the door he saw the sign \"Boy wanted,\" and with a little kindling of hope he entered the store. Just behind the counter stood a man with a sandy beard, who appeared to be the proprietor. To him Jed addressed himself. \"I see you want a boy,\" he said. \"Yes; do you want a place?\" \"Yes, sir.\" [Pg 224] \"I hardly think you would be satisfied with the wages we pay, unless you particularly wish to learn our business.\" \"What do you pay, sir?\" \"Three dollars a week.\" Three dollars a week! It was certainly better than no income at all, but Jed knew well that it would be impossible to live on this sum, and he had no reserve fund to draw upon. \"No,\" he said, \"I am afraid I couldn\u0027t get along on that salary.\" \"Are you entirely dependent on your earnings?\" asked the druggist. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Have you parents residing in the city?\" \"No, sir; I am all alone.\" \"That would be an objection. We prefer to employ those who live at home.\" \"Do most employers require that, sir?\" \"Many do.\" Here a customer came in and asked for a bottle of cough medicine, and the druggist turned away to fill the order. Jed walked slowly out of the store. [Pg 225] \"I wonder whether there is any work for me anywhere?\" he asked himself despondently. Jed continued his walk down Broadway. It was a bright, clear, exhilarating day, and Jed would have enjoyed it thoroughly if he had been better fixed, but it is hard to keep up the spirits when your pocket is empty. When Jed reached City Hall Park he went in and sat down on one of the benches. One of the boy bootblacks who carry on business in the park came up to him with his box on his shoulder and asked, \"Shine your boots?\" Jed shook his head. \"Not this morning,\" he replied. \"They need it,\" said the boy. Jed looked at his boots, and was fain to admit that the boy was right. But he was not possessed of the necessary nickel. \"Yes, they do need it,\" he said, \"but I haven\u0027t money enough to pay you for doing it.\" \"Only five cents.\" \"I haven\u0027t five cents. I\u0027m poorer than you[Pg 226] are, my boy,\" said Jed in a burst of confidence. The boy looked puzzled. \"You don\u0027t look like it,\" he said after scrutinizing Jed\u0027s appearance. \"How did you come to be so poor?\" \"Had all my money stolen last night.\" \"How much was there?\" \"Thirty-five dollars.\" \"Whew!\" whistled the bootblack. \"That was a haul. Who did it?\" \"A young man I fell in with. He invited me to share his room. I woke this morning to find that he had stolen all my money.\" \"He was a snide, he was! I\u0027d like to step on his necktie.\" \"I\u0027d like to do something of that sort myself,\" said Jed with a smile. \"Would you know him if you saw him again?\" \"Yes; I shan\u0027t forget him very soon.\" \"When you do see him hand him over to a cop. Just hold out your foot,\" and the boy got down in a position to black Jed\u0027s shoe. [Pg 227] \"But I haven\u0027t any money. I can\u0027t pay you.\" \"I\u0027ll do it for nothin\u0027, seein\u0027 as you\u0027re down on your luck. You can pay me some time when times is better.\" \"I am afraid you will have to wait a good while for your money.\" \"Never mind! It won\u0027t kill me if I lose it.\" \"You\u0027re very kind to a stranger,\" said Jed, grateful for the boy\u0027s friendly proffer. \"Oh, it ain\u0027t nothin\u0027. You look like a good fellow. You\u0027ll get a place quicker if your shoes look nice.\" There was something practical in this suggestion, and Jed accepted the offer without further hesitation. The boy exerted himself specially, and Jed\u0027s dirty shoes soon showed a dazzling polish. \"There, you can see your face in \u0027em!\" exclaimed the boy, as he rose from his knees. \"Thank you,\" said Jed. \"I see you understand your business. Will you tell me your name?\" \"Jim Parker.\" [Pg 228] \"Well, Jim, I am much obliged to you. I hope some time I can do you a favor.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all right. So long! I hope you\u0027ll get a job.\" And the independent young bootblack, with his box over his shoulder, walked across the park in search of another job. Somehow Jed was cheered by this act of kindness. He felt a little better satisfied with himself, moreover, when he saw the transformation of his dirty shoes to the polish that marks the gentleman. A man rather shabbily dressed was drawn by this outward sign of affluence to sit down beside him. He took a brief inventory of Jed, and then doffing his hat, said deferentially, \"Young gentleman, I hope you will excuse the liberty I am taking, but I have walked all the way from Buffalo, and am reduced almost to my last penny. In fact this nickel,\" producing one from his pocket, \"is all the money I have left. If you will kindly loan me a quarter I shall esteem it a great favor.\" Jed felt like laughing. He had not a penny, yet here was a man richer than himself asking for a loan. [Pg 229] \"I wish I were able to oblige you,\" he said, \"but you are asking me for more than I possess.\" The man glanced incredulously at Jed\u0027s polished shoes. \"You don\u0027t look poor,\" he said, in a tone of sarcasm. \"No, I don\u0027t look poor, but you are five cents richer than I.\" The man shrugged his shoulders. He evidently did not believe Jed. \"It is quite true,\" continued Jed, answering the doubt on the man\u0027s face. \"Last night I was robbed of all the money I had. Had you applied to me yesterday I would have granted your request.\" This frank statement disarmed the man\u0027s suspicion. \"I think your are speaking the truth,\" he said. \"Though there are plenty who pretend to be poor to get rid of giving. Perhaps I shall surprise you when I say that a year ago I should have been able to lend you five thousand dollars, and have as much more left.\" [Pg 230] \"Yes, you do surprise me! How did you lose your money?\" \"I was a fool—that explains it. I bought mining stocks. I was in San Francisco at the time, and my money melted like snow in the sun. A year since I was worth ten thousand dollars. To-day I am worth a nickel. Do you know what I will do with it?\" Jed looked at him inquiringly. \"I will buy a glass of beer, and drink to our good luck—yours and mine.\" \"I hope it will bring the good luck,\" said Jed smiling. \"I would offer you a glass too, if I had another nickel.\" \"Thank you, but I never drink beer. I thank you all the same.\" His companion rose and left the park, probably in search of a beer saloon. Jed got up, too, and took another walk. By half-past twelve he felt decidedly hungry. His breakfast had lasted him till then, but he was young and healthy, and craved three meals a day. \"How shall I manage to get dinner?\" thought Jed seriously. [Pg 231] He paused in front of the Astor House, which he knew to be a hotel, and saw business men entering in quest of their midday lunch. It was tantalizing. There was plenty of food inside, but he lacked the wherewithal to purchase a portion. \"Why, Jed, how are you?\" came unexpectedly to his ears. He looked up and saw a brown-bearded, pleasant-faced man, whom he recognized as a fellow-guest at the Spray Hotel at Sea Spray. \"When did you leave Sea Spray?\" asked his friend. \"Only yesterday.\" \"Going to stay in the city?\" \"Yes, if I can get anything to do.\" \"Have you been to lunch?\" \"Not yet.\" \"Come in and lunch with me, then. I think we can find something inviting at the Astor.\" \"Saved!\" thought Jed, as he gladly passed into the famous hostelry with his friend. \"I wonder if he has any idea how glad I am to accept his invitation?\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82178.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
