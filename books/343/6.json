{"id":12495,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. MR. FOGSON MAKES UP HIS MIND.","content":"\"I don\u0027t know, Jed, whether I can make up to you for the supper you will lose at the poorhouse,\" observed the doctor jocosely. \"Mrs. Redmond may not be as good a cook as Mrs. Fogson.\" \"I will risk it,\" said Jed. \"Is the fare much worse than it was when Mrs. Avery was in charge?\" \"Very much worse. I don\u0027t mind it much myself, for I often get a meal at Fred Morrison\u0027s, but the poor old people have a hard time.\" \"I will make it my business to see that there is an improvement.\" \"Dr. Redmond,\" said Jed after a pause, \"do you think it would be wrong for me to run away from the poorhouse?\" \"Have you any such intention?\" asked the doctor quickly. [Pg 50] \"Yes; I think I can earn my own living, and a better living than I have there. I am young and strong, and I am not afraid to try.\" \"As to that, Jed, I don\u0027t see why there should be any objection to your making the attempt. The town of Scranton ought not to object to lessening the number it is required to support.\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Fogson would object. They would miss my work.\" \"Have you ever spoken to them on the subject?\" \"I did one day, and they said I would have to stay till I was twenty-one.\" \"That is not true.\" \"I don\u0027t think I could stay that long,\" said Jed soberly. \"I should be dead before that time if I had to live with Mr. and Mrs. Fogson, and fared no better. Besides, you see how I am dressed. I should think you would be ashamed to have me at your table.\" Jed\u0027s clothes certainly were far from becoming. They were of unknown antiquity, and were two sizes too small for him, so that[Pg 51] the sleeves and the legs of the trousers were so scant as to attract attention. In his working hours he wore a pair of overalls, but those he took off when he accepted Dr. Redmond\u0027s invitation. \"I didn\u0027t invite your clothes, Jed; I invited you,\" responded the doctor. \"I confess, however, that your suit is pretty shabby. How long have you worn it?\" \"It was given me nearly two years ago.\" \"And you have had no other since?\" \"No. If I stayed there till I was twenty-one I expect I should have to wear the same old things.\" Dr. Redmond laughed. \"I am bound to say, Jed, that in that case you would cut a comical figure. However, I don\u0027t think it will be as bad as that. My son Ross is in college. He is now twenty. I will ask my wife to look about the house and see if there isn\u0027t an old suit of his that will fit you. It will, at any rate, be a good deal better than this.\" \"Thank you, doctor; but will you save it till I am ready to leave Scranton?\" [Pg 52] \"Yes, Jed. I will have it put in a bundle, and it will be ready for you any time you call for it.\" \"There\u0027s another thing, doctor. I think Mr. Fogson will try to get my money away, notwithstanding all you said.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t dare to.\" \"He is very cunning. He will find some excuse.\" Jed was right. To prove this, we will go back to the poorhouse and relate the conversation between the well-matched pair after Dr. Redmond\u0027s departure. \"Simeon,\" said his wife, \"if you had any spunk you wouldn\u0027t let Dr. Redmond insult and bully you, as he did just now.\" \"What would you have me to do?\" demanded her husband irritably. \"I couldn\u0027t knock him down, could I?\" \"No, but you could have talked up to him.\" \"I did; but you must remember that he is an important man in the town, and it wouldn\u0027t be wise to make him an enemy.\" \"Squire Dixon is still more important. If[Pg 53] he backs you up you needn\u0027t be afraid of this trumpery doctor.\" \"Well, what would you advise?\" \"Go this evening and see the squire. Tell him what has happened, and if he gives you authority to take Jed\u0027s money, take it.\" \"Really, that is a good suggestion, Mrs. F. I will go soon after supper.\" \"It would do no good to triumph over Dr. Redmond. He is an impertinent meddler.\" \"So he is. I agree with you there.\" Soon after seven o\u0027clock Squire Dixon was somewhat surprised when the servant ushered Mr. Fogson into his presence. \"Ah, Fogson,\" he exclaimed. \"I was not expecting to see you. Has anything gone wrong?\" \"I should think so. Jed has rebelled against my lawful authority, and Dr. Redmond is aiding and abetting him in it.\" \"You astonish me, Fogson. Are you sure you are not mistaken?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you the whole story, squire, and you can judge for yourself.\" Upon this Mr. Fogson gave an account of[Pg 54] the scenes that had taken place in the poorhouse, including his contest with Jed, and Mrs. Fogson\u0027s ill-judged attempt to assist him. \"Certainly, you were in bad luck,\" said the squire. \"Is the injury serious?\" \"The burn is very painful, squire. Mrs. Fogson acted like an idiot. Why didn\u0027t she take better aim?\" \"To be sure, to be sure. Wasn\u0027t the boy scalded at all?\" \"Not a particle,\" answered Fogson in an aggrieved tone. \"Now, what I want to know is, didn\u0027t I have a right to take the money from Jed?\" \"Yes, I think so. The boy would probably have made bad use of it.\" \"The ground I take, squire, is that a pauper has no right to possess money.\" \"I quite agree with you. Since the town maintains him, the town should have a right to exact any money of which he becomes accidentally possessed.\" \"I don\u0027t quite see that the town should have it,\" said Fogson. \"As the boy\u0027s official[Pg 55] guardian, I think I ought to keep it, to use for the boy whenever I thought it judicious.\" \"Yes, I think that view is correct. I had only given the point a superficial consideration.\" \"Dr. Redmond denies this. He says I have no right to take the money from Jed.\" \"Dr. Redmond\u0027s view is not entitled to any weight. He has no official right to intermeddle.\" \"You\u0027d think he had, by the manner in which he lectured Mrs. Fogson and myself. I never heard such impudence.\" \"Dr. Redmond assumes too much. He doesn\u0027t appear to understand that I, and not he, was appointed Overseer of the Poor.\" \"He says you are not fit for the position,\" said Fogson, transcending the limits of strict accuracy, as the reader will understand. \"What?\" ejaculated Squire Dixon, his face flushing angrily. \"That\u0027s just what he said,\" repeated Fogson, delighted by the effect of his misrepresentations. \"It\u0027s my belief that he wanted the office himself.\" [Pg 56] \"Very likely, very likely!\" said the squire angrily. \"Do I understand you to say that he actually called me unfit for the position?\" \"Yes he did. He appears to think that he can boss you and Mrs. F. and myself. Why, he stood by that boy, though he had actually assaulted me, and invited him home to supper.\" \"You don\u0027t mean this, Mr. Fogson?\" \"Yes I do. Jed is at this very moment at the doctor\u0027s house. What mischief they are concocting I can\u0027t tell, but I am sure that I shall have more trouble with the boy.\" Squire Dixon was very much disturbed. He was a vain man, and his pride sustained a severe shock when told that the doctor considered him unfit for his position. \"However,\" resumed the crafty Fogson, \"I suppose we shall have to give in to the doctor.\" \"Give in!\" exclaimed the squire, his face turning purple. \"Never, Mr. Fogson, never!\" \"I hate to give in, I confess, squire, but the doctor is a prominent man, and——\" \"Prominent man! I should like to know[Pg 57] whether I am not a prominent man also, Mr. Fogson? Moreover, I represent the town, and Dr. Redmond doesn\u0027t.\" \"I am glad you will stand by me, squire. With you on my side, I will not fear.\" \"I will stand by you, Mr. Fogson.\" \"I should hate to be triumphed over by a mere boy.\" \"You shall not be, Mr. Fogson.\" \"Then will you authorize me to demand the money from him?\" \"I will authorize you, Mr. Fogson, and if the boy persists in refusing, I authorize you to use coercive measures. Do you understand?\" \"I believe I do, squire. You will let it be understood that you have given me authority, won\u0027t you? Suppose the boy complains to Dr. Redmond?\" \"You may refer Dr. Redmond to me, Mr. Fogson,\" said the squire pompously. \"I think I shall be tempted to give this meddling doctor a piece of my mind.\" Mr. Fogson took leave of the squire and pursued his way homeward with a smile on[Pg 58] his face. He had accomplished what he desired, and secured a powerful ally in his campaign against the boy Jed and Dr. Redmond. He returned home a little after eight, and just before nine Jed made his appearance at the door of the poorhouse. He was in good spirits, for he had decided that he would soon turn his back upon the place which had been his home for fourteen years. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82159.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
