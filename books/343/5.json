{"id":12494,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. JED SECURES AN ALLY.","content":"It was trying to Mrs. Fogson to see her husband apparently getting the worst of it from \"that young viper,\" as she mentally apostrophized Jed, and she longed to take a part, notwithstanding her husband\u0027s refusal to accept her assistance. A bright but malicious idea struck her. She seized a tin dipper and filled it half full from the tea-kettle, the water in which was almost scalding. Then she seized an opportunity to empty it over Jed. But unfortunately for the success of her amiable plan, by the time she was ready to pour it out it was Mr. Fogson who was exposed, and he received the whole of the water on his neck and shoulder. \"Help! Help! Murder!\" he shrieked in anguish. \"You have scalded me, you—you she cat!\" [Pg 38] As he spoke he released his hold on Jed, who sprang to his feet and stood watching for the next movement of the enemy. \"Did I scald you, Simeon?\" asked Mrs. Fogson in dismay. \"Yes; I am almost dead. Get some flour and sweet oil—quick!\" \"I didn\u0027t mean to,\" said his wife repentantly. \"I meant it for that boy.\" \"You\u0027re an idiot!\" roared Fogson, stamping his foot. \"Go and get the oil—quick!\" Mrs. Fogson, much frightened, hurried to obey orders, and the next fifteen minutes were spent in allaying the anguish of her lord and master, who made it very unpleasant for her by his bitter complaints and upbraidings. \"I think I\u0027d better get out of this,\" thought Jed. \"The old woman will be trying to scald me next.\" He disappeared through the side door, leaving the amiable couple busily but not pleasantly employed. He had scarcely left the house when Dr. Redmond drove up, his errand being to see one of the inmates of the poorhouse. [Pg 39] \"How are you, Jed?\" he said pleasantly. \"My wife tells me you did her a great service to-day?\" \"I was glad to do it, doctor,\" said Jed. \"Here\u0027s a dollar. I am sure you can use it.\" \"But, doctor, Mrs. Redmond gave me a dollar.\" \"Never mind! You can use both.\" \"Thank you,\" said Jed. \"You\u0027d better go right in, doctor; Mrs. Fogson has just scalded her husband, and he is in great pain.\" \"How did it happen?\" asked the doctor in amazement. \"Go in and they\u0027ll tell you,\" said Jed. \"I\u0027ll see you afterwards and tell you whether their story is correct.\" When Mr. and Mrs. Fogson saw the doctor enter they were overjoyed. \"Oh, Dr. Redmond,\" groaned Fogson, \"do something to relieve me quick. I\u0027m in terrible pain.\" \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Dr. Redmond. \"I am scalded.\" [Pg 40] \"How did it happen?\" \"She did it!\" said Fogson, pointing scornfully to Mrs. Fogson. Dr. Redmond set himself at once to relieve the suffering one, making use of the remedies that Fogson himself had suggested to his wife. When the patient was more comfortable he turned gravely to Mrs. Fogson and asked: \"Will you explain how your husband got scalded?\" \"The woman poured hot water on me,\" interrupted Fogson with an ugly scowl. \"It would serve her right if I treated her in the same manner.\" \"You don\u0027t mean that she did it on purpose, Mr. Fogson?\" exclaimed the doctor. \"Of course I didn\u0027t,\" retorted Mrs. Fogson indignantly. \"I meant it for Jed.\" \"You meant to scald Jed?\" said the doctor sternly. \"Yes; he assaulted my husband, and I feared he would kill him. It was all the way I could help.\" \"Mrs. Fogson, I can hardly believe you would be guilty of such an atrocious act even[Pg 41] on your own confession, nor can I believe that Jed would assault your husband without good cause.\" \"It is true, whether you believe it or not,\" said Mrs. Fogson sullenly. Dr. Redmond\u0027s answer was to open the outer door and call \"Jed!\" Jed entered at once, and stood in the presence of his persecutors, calm and undisturbed. \"Jed,\" said the doctor, \"Mrs. Fogson admits that she scalded her husband in trying to scald you, and urges, in defense, that you assaulted Mr. Fogson. What do you say to this?\" \"That Mr. Fogson struck me over the shoulder with a horsewhip, and that I pulled it away from him. Upon this he sprang at me, and in self-defense I grappled with him, and while we were rolling over the floor Mrs. Fogson poured a dipper of hot water over her husband, meaning it for me.\" \"Is this true, Mr. Fogson?\" asked the doctor. \"Yes, it\u0027s about so. Mrs. Fogson acted like an idiot.\" [Pg 42] \"If she had scalded Jed instead of you, would you say the same thing?\" \"Well, of course that would have been different.\" \"I can see no difference,\" said Dr. Redmond sternly. \"It was not an idiotic, but a brutal and inhuman act.\" \"Come, doctor, that\u0027s rather strong,\" protested Fogson uncomfortably. \"It is not too strong! I don\u0027t think there is a person in the village but would agree with me. Had the victim of the scalding been Jed, I would have reported the matter to the authorities. Now tell me why you attempted to horsewhip the boy?\" \"Because he was impudent,\" replied Fogson evasively. \"And that was all?\" \"He disobeyed me.\" \"Jed, let me hear your version of the story.\" \"Mr. Fogson knew that I had a dollar given me by Mrs. Redmond, and he called upon me to give it up to him. I wouldn\u0027t do it, and upon that he tried to horsewhip me.\" [Pg 43] \"You see he owns up to his disobeying me, doctor,\" put in Fogson triumphantly. \"Why did you require him to give you the dollar, Mr. Fogson?\" \"Because he is a pauper, and a pauper has no right to hold money.\" \"I won\u0027t discuss that point. What did you propose to do with the dollar in case you had obtained it from Jed?\" \"As you are not Overseer of the Poor, Dr. Redmond, I don\u0027t know that I have any call to tell you. When Squire Dixon asks me I will make it all straight with him.\" \"Probably,\" answered the doctor in a significant tone, for he as well as others understood that there was some secret compact between Mr. Fogson and the town official, and he had earnestly opposed Squire Dixon at the polls. \"Not only you, but Squire Dixon will have to give an account of your stewardship,\" he said. \"If any outrage should be committed against the boy Jed, or any one else in this establishment, you will find that making it straight with Squire Dixon won\u0027t be sufficient.\" [Pg 44] \"I will report what you say to Squire Dixon,\" said Fogson defiantly. \"I wish you would. I shouldn\u0027t object to saying the same thing to his face. Now, Mrs. Fogson, if you will lead the way I will go and see Mrs. Connolly.\" \"Come along, then,\" said Mrs. Fogson, compressing her thin lips. \"I don\u0027t believe there is anything the matter with that old woman.\" \"I am a better judge of that matter than you, Mrs. Fogson.\" The poor old woman looked thin and wan, and hardly had strength to lift up her head to meet the doctor\u0027s glance. After a brief examination he said: \"Your trouble is nervous debility. You have no strength. What you need is nourishment. Do you have tea three times a day, Mrs. Connolly?\" \"Only once a week, doctor,\" wailed the poor old woman, bursting into tears. \"Only once a week!\" repeated the doctor shocked. \"What does this mean, Mrs. Fogson?\" [Pg 45] \"It means, Dr. Redmond,\" answered the mistress of the poorhouse, \"that this is not a first-class hotel.\" \"I should say not,\" commented the doctor. \"How often did you have tea, Mrs. Connolly, when Mr. and Mrs. Avery were here?\" \"At breakfast and supper, and on Sundays three times a day.\" \"Precisely. What do you say to that, Mrs. Fogson?\" \"I say, as everybody says, that the Averys squandered the town\u0027s money.\" \"They certainly didn\u0027t put it into their own pockets. The town, I think I am safe in saying, doesn\u0027t mean to starve the poor people whom it provides for. Do I understand that you are actuated by a desire to save the town\u0027s money?\" \"Of course I am, and Squire Dixon approves all I do,\" answered Mrs. Fogson defiantly. \"If he approves your withholding the necessities of life from those under your charge he is unfit for his position. When the accounts of the poorhouse are audited at the end[Pg 46] of the year I shall make a searching examination, and ascertain how much less they are under your administration than under that of your predecessors.\" Judging from her looks, Mrs. Fogson was aching to scratch Dr. Redmond\u0027s eyes out; but as he was not a pauper she was compelled to restrain her anger. \"Now, Mrs. Connolly,\" said the doctor, \"you are to have tea twice a day, and three times on Sunday. I shall see that it is given to you,\" he added, with a significant glance at Mrs. Fogson. \"Oh, how glad I am!\" said the poor creature. \"God bless you, Dr. Redmond!\" \"Mrs. Fogson,\" went on the doctor, \"do you limit yourself to tea once a week?\" \"I ain\u0027t a pauper, Dr. Redmond!\" replied Mrs. Fogson indignantly. \"No; you are much stronger than a pauper, and could bear the deprivation better. Let me tell you that you needn\u0027t be afraid to supply decent food to the poor people in your charge. It won\u0027t cost any more than it did under the Averys, for prices are, on the whole, cheaper.\" [Pg 47] \"Perhaps if it does cost more you\u0027ll pay it out of your own pocket.\" \"I contribute already to the support of the poorhouse, being a large taxpayer, and I give my medical services without exacting payment. The town is not mean, and I will see that no fault is found with reasonable bills.\" \"I wish you\u0027d fall and break your neck, you old meddler,\" thought Mrs. Fogson, but she did not dare to say this. \"One thing more, madam!\" said the doctor, who had now entered the room where Jed and her husband were; \"reserve your hot water for its legitimate uses. No more scalding, if you please.\" \"That\u0027s well put, doctor!\" growled Fogson. \"If she wants to scald anybody else, she had better try herself.\" \"That\u0027s all the gratitude I get for taking your part, Simeon Fogson,\" said the exasperated helpmeet. \"The next time, Jed may beat you black and blue for all I care.\" \"It strikes me,\" remarked the doctor dryly, \"that your husband is a match for a boy of sixteen, and need be under no [Pg 48]apprehension. No more horsewhips, Mr. Fogson, if you please, and don\u0027t trouble yourself about any small sums that Jed may receive. Jed, jump into my buggy, and I will take you home with me. I think Mrs. Redmond will give you some supper.\" \"The boy hasn\u0027t done his chores,\" said Mrs. Fogson maliciously. \"Very well, I will make a bargain with you. Don\u0027t object to his going, and I won\u0027t charge Mr. Fogson anything for my attendance upon him just now.\" This appeal to the selfish interests of Mr. Fogson had its effect, and Jed jumped into the doctor\u0027s buggy with eager alacrity. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82158.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
