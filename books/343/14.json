{"id":12503,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. JED\u0027S LUCK.","content":"Jed continued to act in the part assigned to him. He knew that he was liable to be superseded at any time by Ralph Clinton, but he did not care to borrow trouble. As a matter of fact, however, he was allowed to play till the end of the season, but this was not very far off. Warm weather had set in, and audiences became small. One day Harry Bertram called Jed aside. \"Well, Jed,\" he said, \"I am afraid we must part.\" \"Why, Mr. Bertram?\" \"The weather has become so warm that we are no longer paying expenses. Mr. Mordaunt has decided to close the season on Saturday night.\" Jed looked blank. He didn\u0027t know what would come next. \"I thought we might hold out another[Pg 126] week, and we might if the weather had remained comfortable, but people won\u0027t come to see \u0027The Gold King\u0027 or any other play when the thermometer stands at eighty degrees.\" \"What shall you do, Mr. Bertram?\" \"Fall back on my trade, if possible.\" \"What is that?\" \"I am a telegraph operator, and I may be able to fill in the summer in some Western union office. I have to work at summer prices, but as long as I make my board and lodging I shall be content.\" \"I wish I had a trade,\" said Jed thoughtfully. \"You don\u0027t feel like going back to your old home?\" \"In the Scranton poorhouse? Not much!\" answered Jed energetically. \"I\u0027ll starve first. Have you got any place engaged?\" \"No, but I have worked two summers at Sea Spray, an Atlantic coast summer resort. I shall go there and see if there is an opening.\" \"Is it far away?\" \"About fifty miles. I\u0027ll tell you what, Jed,[Pg 127] you had better come with me. Something may turn up for you.\" \"What is the fare, Mr. Bertram?\" \"About a dollar and a half. You will have some money coming to you. You haven\u0027t been paid anything yet, have you?\" \"No; I didn\u0027t suppose I was entitled to any.\" \"You will get something. I will speak to the treasurer and arrange matters for you.\" Accordingly on Saturday evening, after the last performance, Jed was made happy by receiving twelve dollars, or at the rate of four dollars per week for the time he had been employed. \"Mr. Mordaunt directs me to say that he would pay you more if the business would permit,\" said the treasurer. \"Tell him this is more than I expected,\" said Jed elated. \"That isn\u0027t professional,\" remarked Bertram smiling. \"Actors generally claim to be worth a good deal more than they are paid.\" \"I haven\u0027t been on the stage long enough to be professional,\" said Jed. [Pg 128] Early on Monday morning Jed and his friend Bertram took the cars for Sea Spray. As they neared the coast, the ocean breeze entered cool and refreshing through the open windows. Presently the cars stopped, only two hundred feet from the bluff, and Jed for the first time gazed with delight at the Atlantic billows rolling in on the beach. \"This is beautiful!\" he exclaimed. \"I hope I can stay here all summer.\" \"Have you never seen the sea before?\" \"No; I have never travelled before. All my life has been spent at Scranton.\" \"Take a walk with me along Ocean Avenue, and I will see what chance there is of my obtaining employment.\" Harry Bertram made his way to the principal hotel, where he knew there was a Western union office. He told Jed to sit down in the reading-room while he sought for information. In ten minutes he came back with a smile of satisfaction on his face. \"I am in great luck,\" he said. \"The operator here has just been summoned home[Pg 129] by the serious illness of his father in Chicago. He was considering whom he could get to take his place when I presented myself. The result is that I am engaged to take charge of the telegraph office at twelve dollars a week and my board.\" \"Then you are provided for.\" \"Yes. I can get through the summer very well.\" \"I should think so. You will have the twelve dollars a week clear.\" \"No; I must get a room outside. However, my predecessor has recommended his—in a private house about a quarter of a mile from the shore—at only four dollars a week.\" \"Then I suppose we must part,\" said Jed with a tinge of sadness. \"No, Jed. You shall room with me, and your room will cost you nothing. As to meals, I can see you through till you secure some work.\" \"But I don\u0027t want to be a burden upon you, Mr. Bertram.\" \"I don\u0027t mean that you shall be, any longer than is necessary. It will go hard if a boy[Pg 130] like you can\u0027t find something to do that will buy his meals at a crowded watering-place.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Bertram. I have money enough left to buy my meals for two weeks at least.\" \"If we were at a regular office I could employ you as messenger, but most of the messages will come to guests in the hotel.\" \"I don\u0027t know exactly what I can do, but I am ready to do anything.\" \"Except black boots,\" said Bertram with a smile. \"I don\u0027t think I should like to do that if there is anything else to be found.\" \"I couldn\u0027t think of allowing a member of our honorable profession to undertake such menial employment.\" Harry Bertram went to work that evening. Jed kept him company in the office a part of the time, and during the three succeeding days went from one hotel to another to see if he could obtain anything to do. But every position had been filled for the season. Jed began to fear that there was no work for him at Sea Spray. [Pg 131] On the fourth morning, as he was sitting with Bertram, a gentleman whom he had several times seen—a guest of the house—approached them. \"Is this boy your brother?\" he asked of Bertram. \"No, but he is my valued friend. In fact, I may call myself his guardian for the time being.\" \"Yes,\" assented Jed with a smile. \"He does not assist you?\" \"No, he knows nothing of telegraphy.\" \"Would you like employment?\" asked the gentleman, turning to Jed. \"I am very anxious to get work,\" said Jed quickly. \"Then I think I may be able to meet your wishes. How old are you?\" \"Sixteen.\" \"You may have seen a boy of ten walking about with me?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"He is my son. He and I are here alone, but until yesterday I had a nurse in my employ whose sole business was to look after[Pg 132] Chester. I felt entire confidence in her, but discovered last evening that she had purloined some jewelry belonging to me. Of course I discharged her instantly, and in consequence am obliged to find some one in her place. \"Chester objects to another nurse. It hurts his boyish pride to have a woman accompanying him everywhere. It appears to me that a boy old enough to look after him will suit him much better. But perhaps you would not like being encumbered with a small boy?\" \"I should like it very much, sir,\" said Jed. \"I like young boys, and I am sure I should like your son.\" \"Come up stairs, then. I will see how he likes you.\" Jed followed his new acquaintance up to a suite of two rooms on the second floor. A young boy was at the window. He looked inquiringly at his father and Jed. \"Come here, Chester,\" said the former. \"Are you quite sure you don\u0027t want another nurse?\" \"Yes,\" answered the boy. \"Some of the[Pg 133] boys in the hotel call me \u0027sissy\u0027 because I have a girl always with me.\" \"Would you prefer this boy?\" Chester took a long, close look at Jed, who met his glance with a smile. \"Yes,\" said the little boy confidently. \"I shall like him much better than a girl.\" \"That settles it,\" said Mr. Holbrook in a tone of satisfaction. \"What is your name?\" \"Jed Gilman.\" \"What was your last employment?\" \"I took the boy\u0027s part in \u0027The Gold King.\u0027\" \"Are you an actor?\" asked Chester, much interested. \"Not much of one.\" \"You must have some talent,\" remarked Mr. Holbrook, \"or Mr. Mordaunt, who is a manager of reputation, would not have employed you. Is your season over?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I think you will suit me. I am obliged to be in New York every day on business, and this leaves Chester alone. I wish you to act as his companion, to go with him on the[Pg 134] beach and in bathing, and to look after him while I am away. Are you boarding here?\" \"No, sir; I could not afford it.\" \"I shall arrange to have you take meals here with Chester, but after eight o\u0027clock in the evenings you will be your own master. Now as to the matter of compensation. Will ten dollars a week satisfy you?\" \"Ten dollars a week and my meals?\" \"Yes.\" \"I didn\u0027t expect so much.\" \"I like to pay liberally, and expect to be well served.\" \"When shall I commence, sir?\" \"At once. I want to take the next train for the city. As I go down stairs I will tell them that you are to take your meals here. Now, Chester, I will leave you with your new friend, as I have barely time to reach the next train for New York.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82167.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
