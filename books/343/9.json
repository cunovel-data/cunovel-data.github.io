{"id":12498,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. JED LEAVES THE POORHOUSE.","content":"At eight o\u0027clock Harry Bertram was summoned to breakfast in the private sitting-room of Mr. and Mrs. Fogson. In spite of the poor fare of which the paupers complained the Fogsons took care themselves to have appetizing meals, and the well-spread table looked really attractive. \"Sit down here, Mr. Bertram,\" said Mrs. Fogson, pointing to a seat. The place opposite was vacant, as the heads of the table were occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Fogson. \"Mrs. Fogson,\" said the actor, \"I am going to ask a favor.\" \"What is it?\" returned the lady, wreathing her features into a frosty smile. \"I see the seat opposite me is unoccupied. Will you oblige me by letting the boy Jed take it?\" [Pg 78] Mrs. Fogson\u0027s face changed. \"I should prefer not to have him here,\" she answered in a forbidding tone. \"Of course I propose to pay for his breakfast the same price that I pay for my own.\" \"The boy is insubordinate and disobedient,\" said the lady coldly. \"Still he gave me his bed last night. Some boys would have objected.\" \"My dear,\" said Fogson, whose weakness for money has already been mentioned, \"I think, as the gentleman has agreed to pay for Jed\u0027s breakfast, we may give our consent, merely to gratify him.\" \"Very well,\" answered Mrs. Fogson, resolved to claim the twenty-five cents for herself. She rose from her seat, went to the window, and opening it, called to Jed, who was at work in the yard. He speedily made his appearance. \"Sit down to the table, Jedediah,\" said Mr. Fogson with dignity. \"Mr. Bertram desires you to breakfast with him.\" Jed was very much surprised, but as he[Pg 79] noted the warm biscuit and beefsteak, which emitted an appetizing odor, he felt that it was an invitation not to be rejected. \"I am very much obliged to Mr. Bertram,\" he said, \"and also to you and Mrs. Fogson.\" This was a politic remark to make, and he was served as liberally as the guest. \"Do you find your position a pleasant one, Mr. Fogson?\" asked Bertram politely. \"No, Mr. Bertram, far from it. The paupers are a thankless, ungrateful set, but I am sustained by a sense of duty.\" \"The paupers were spoiled by our predecessors, Mr. and Mrs. Avery,\" chimed in Mrs. Fogson. \"Really, Mr. Bertram, you would be surprised to learn how unreasonable they are. They are always complaining of their meals.\" \"I am sure they must be unreasonable if they complain of meals like this, Mrs. Fogson,\" said the actor. \"Of course we can\u0027t afford to treat them like this. The town would object. But we give them as good fare as we can afford. Are you going to stay long in Scranton?\" [Pg 80] \"No; I am merely passing through. I shall sleep to-night at Duncan.\" \"At the poorhouse?\" asked Jed with a comical smile. \"Yes, if I could be sure of as good fare as this,\" replied the actor with an answering smile. \"But that would be very doubtful.\" Mrs. Fogson, who, cross-grained as she was, was not above flattery, mentally pronounced Mr. Bertram a most agreeable young man—in fact, a perfect gentleman. \"I am really ashamed,\" continued Bertram, \"to have entered your house in such a condition, but I was feeling a little internal disturbance, and fancied that whisky would relieve it. Unfortunately I took too much.\" \"It might have happened to anyone,\" said Fogson considerately. \"I am myself a temperance man, but sometimes I find whisky beneficial to my health.\" Bertram, noticing the ruddy hue of Mr. Fogson\u0027s nose, was quite ready to believe this statement. \"May I ask if you are a business man?\" remarked Fogson. [Pg 81] \"My business is acting. I belong to the Gold King Company, which is to play at Duncan to-night.\" \"Indeed!\" said Mrs. Fogson, with a glance of curiosity. \"I never saw an actor before.\" \"I am sorry you should see such an unworthy representative of the Thespian art. If we were to play in Scranton, it would give me pleasure to offer you and Mr. Fogson complimentary tickets.\" \"I wish you were to play here,\" said Mrs. Fogson in a tone of regret. \"I haven\u0027t seen a play for five years.\" \"I suppose you couldn\u0027t come to Duncan?\" \"No; we could not be spared. Besides, we have no horse and carriage,\" said Fogson. \"We must wait till you perform in Scranton.\" Jed was very much relieved to hear this remark, for it would have interfered with his own plans if Mr. and Mrs. Fogson had accepted an invitation to witness the play at Duncan. \"Is it a good paying business?\" asked Mr. Fogson. \"Well, so so. My salary is fifty dollars a week.\" [Pg 82] \"You don\u0027t say so!\" exclaimed Fogson in envious surprise. \"You ought to lay up money.\" \"It seems so, but in the summer we generally have a long vacation. Besides, we have to pay our hotel bills; so that, after all, we don\u0027t have as much left as you would suppose. Besides, we have to buy our costumes, and some of them are quite expensive.\" In spite of these drawbacks the Fogsons evidently looked upon Bertram as a wealthy young man. At length they rose from the table. Jed had never before eaten such a meal since he entered the poorhouse, and he felt in a degree envious of Mr. and Mrs. Fogson, who probably fared thus every day. When he considered, however, how they nearly starved the poor people of whom they had charge he felt indignant, and could not help wishing that some time they might exchange places with the unfortunate paupers. He went out to the yard again, and resumed his work at the woodpile. Harry Bertram strolled out and lazily watched him. [Pg 83] \"I suppose you never did work of this kind, Mr. Bertram?\" said Jed. \"Oh yes, I lived for nearly a year with an aunt who required me to prepare all the wood for the kitchen stove. I can tell you one thing, though, I did not enjoy it, and when I left her I retired forever from that line of business.\" \"Are you going to stay in Scranton to-day?\" \"No; I must be getting over to Duncan. We have taken on a new actor and shall be obliged to have a rehearsal. Will you go along with me?\" \"I should like to, but it would only get me into trouble. I will start about four o\u0027clock, and go over to Dr. Redmond\u0027s to get the suit of clothes he promised me.\" \"I suppose you won\u0027t have to take a trunk of clothes from here?\" \"About all the clothes I own are on my back. If I leave any behind me, anyone is welcome to them.\" \"Do you think there will be any difficulty in your getting away?\" [Pg 84] \"I think I can slip off without being noticed.\" \"Do you think they will go after you?\" \"They might if they suspected where I was going.\" \"Then I shall have to help you. Join me at the theatre, and it will go hard if, between us, we cannot foil the enemy.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Bertram. You are a real friend.\" \"Some people say I am everybody\u0027s friend but my own. You can judge for yourself about that when you know me better.\" Harry Bertram walked off whistling, and Jed was left to his reflections. It is needless to say that he felt in an excited mood, for it seemed to him that he had come to a turning-point in his life. As far back as he could remember he had been an inmate of the Scranton poorhouse. When Mr. and Mrs. Avery were in charge he had not minded this much, such was the kindness with which he was treated by those good people. But when, through the influence of Squire Dixon, they were removed and[Pg 85] Mr. and Mrs. Fogson put in their place he began to feel the bitterness of his position. The three months which had passed since then seemed to him like so many years. But now he had resolved, once for all, to end his thralldom, and go out into the great world and see what he could do for himself. Circumstances favored him. About half-past three Mr. Fogson called him down. \"I want you to go to Squire Dixon\u0027s and carry this letter,\" he said. Jed\u0027s heart leaped with joy. It at once occurred to him that Squire Dixon lived only about twenty rods from Dr. Redmond, and that he could call at the doctor\u0027s house after doing his errand. \"Is there any answer?\" he asked. \"No; I have asked the squire to call here this evening, if he can. He is the overseer, and I wish to consult him.\" \"Very well, sir.\" Jed took the letter, glad that no answer would be required. Even if there had been, he would have neglected to bring it, for he[Pg 86] could not afford to throw away this chance of escape. The distance from the poorhouse to Squire Dixon\u0027s residence was about three-quarters of a mile. Jed covered it in less than fifteen minutes. In the front yard Percy Dixon was strutting about with the airy consequence habitual to him. \"What brings you here?\" he asked rudely. \"I\u0027ve come with a note for your father. After I\u0027ve delivered it I will stop a little while and play with you if you want me to.\" \"You needn\u0027t trouble yourself. I don\u0027t care to play with paupers.\" \"Don\u0027t call me that again, Percy Dixon!\" said Jed, his patience worn out. \"What will happen if I do?\" demanded Percy tauntingly. \"I may be obliged to give you a thrashing.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82162.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
