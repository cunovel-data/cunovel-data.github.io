{"id":12515,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. IN SEARCH OF EMPLOYMENT.","content":"Jed followed his hotel friend up stairs into an upper dining-room, and they took seats at a corner table. \"I never like to dine alone,\" said Howell Foster. \"I am glad I fell in with you, Jed.\" \"So am I,\" answered Jed. \"I am more glad than you have any idea of,\" he said to himself. \"What will you order?\" asked Mr. Foster, pushing over the bill of fare to his companion. \"I have a healthy appetite and shall enjoy anything,\" said Jed with a smile. \"Please order the same for me as for yourself.\" Howell Foster was rather proud of his gastronomic knowledge, and took this as a compliment. \"You can trust me to do that,\" he replied. \"I am used to the place and know what they succeed best in.\" [Pg 233] Thereupon he ordered a dinner which Jed found delicious. No expense was spared, and Jed, glancing at the bill when it was brought, found that the charge was three dollars and a half. During the repast the host kept up a bright and chatty conversation. \"I hope you enjoyed your dinner,\" he said, when it was over. \"Actions speak louder than words,\" answered Jed with a smile. \"This is a good, reliable place. I advise you to come here often.\" \"What would he say if he could see the inside of my pocket-book?\" thought Jed. \"I am afraid,\" he said aloud, \"it is too expensive for my means.\" \"Yes, probably; I didn\u0027t think of that. By the way, what have you in view?\" \"I hardly know yet.\" \"Come round and see me some day,\" and Foster handed Jed his card. \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Will you have a cigar?\" \"No, thank you, sir. I don\u0027t smoke.\" [Pg 234] \"It would be money in my pocket if I didn\u0027t. My cigars cost me last year five hundred dollars.\" \"I wish I was sure of that for my entire income,\" thought Jed. They parted at the entrance to the hotel. It was clear from his manner and speech that Howell Foster thought Jed in easy circumstances. It made the boy feel almost like an impostor, but he reflected that he had done nothing to give Mr. Foster a false impression. It was about half-past one when he left the hotel. The dinner had occupied an hour. The world was still before him, but he had eaten a hearty meal and felt that he could get along, if necessary, till the next morning, so far as eating was concerned. Where to sleep presented a perplexing problem, but it would be some time before it required to be solved. How to spend the afternoon puzzled Jed. He went back to City Hall Park, and on the seat he had formerly occupied he found a copy of the New York Herald which somebody had left there. He[Pg 235] took it up and looked over the advertisements for Help Wanted. He found the following: Wanted.—Smart, enterprising agents to sell packages of stationery. Fifteen dollars a week can easily be made. Call at No. 182 Nassau Street, Room 22. This struck Jed as just the thing. It could not be very hard to sell stationery, and fifteen dollars a week would support him comfortably. \"Where is Nassau Street?\" he inquired of a bootblack who took a temporary seat beside him. \"There \u0027tis,\" said the street boy, pointing in the direction of the Tribune building. \"You just go down in front of the Tribune.\" \"Is No. 182 far off?\" \"No, it\u0027s close by. You can get there in less than no time.\" \"Thank you!\" and with hope in his heart Jed rose and walked in the direction indicated. He found the building. At the entrance was a list of occupants of rooms. He went up[Pg 236] two flights of stairs, and halted in front of No. 22. He knocked at the door and was bidden in a deep, hoarse voice to \"Come in!\" Opening the door, he found himself in the presence of a short, humpbacked man, whose voice was quite out of proportion to his size. \"I suppose you come to see me about the advertisement in the Herald,\" said the dwarf. \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jed, gazing as if fascinated at the stunted figure, huge head and long arms of the person before him. \"I have engaged several agents already this morning,\" went on the dwarf, turning over a large book on the desk before him. \"Then perhaps you don\u0027t need any more?\" said Jed despondently. \"Oh, yes, I do if I can get the right ones,\" was the answer. \"It is to sell packages of stationery, I believe. Can you show me some?\" The dwarf handed Jed a flat package, on the outside of which was printed a list of the contents. They included a pen holder, pens, a quire of paper, a supply of envelopes, and several other articles. [Pg 237] \"This is the best package in the market for the money,\" said the dwarf. \"Observe how varied are the contents, and only a paltry twenty-five cents for the whole.\" \"Yes, it seems a good bargain,\" said Jed. \"You are right there,\" said the dwarf confidently. \"Why, you can make money hand over hand. Our agents are actually coining it. We allow them to retain ten cents on each package. Two or three, and sometimes five, are sold to the same person. Would you like to have me read one or two agents\u0027 letters?\" \"Yes, if you please.\" \"Here is one from Theodore Jenkins, who is operating in Pennsylvania: \"\u0027Hugo Higgins, Esq. \"\u0027Dear Sir: \"\u0027Please send me at once two hundred packages of stationery. They sell like hot cakes. I got rid of forty yesterday, and it rained half the day, too. I have held several agencies for different articles, but none that paid as well as this. I shall be disappointed if I don\u0027t make forty dollars per week. It looks as if it might exceed that sum. \"\u0027Yours respectfully, \"\u0027Theodore Jenkins.\u0027 [Pg 238] \"That letter speaks for itself,\" remarked the dwarf as he folded it up and replaced it in an envelope. \"Yes,\" said Jed, \"it is certainly very encouraging.\" \"I will read you another from a party who has been in our employ for fourteen months. He is operating in Ohio. \"\u0027Dear Sir: \"\u0027You may send me three hundred packages by Adams Express, and please don\u0027t delay, for I need them at once. I have been working for you for fourteen months. During that time I have supported my family and bought a house, on which I have paid cash down a thousand dollars. In the course of the next year and a half I expect to complete the payment and own the house clean. It was certainly a lucky thing for me when I saw your advertisement for agents and engaged in your service. \"\u0027Yours gratefully, \"\u0027Arthur Waters. \"That is another letter that speaks for itself,\" observed Mr. Higgins. \"I have plenty more, but I don\u0027t think I need to read any others to convince you that the business will pay any one that takes hold of it.\" [Pg 239] \"Perhaps,\" added Jed, \"these gentlemen had experience as agents.\" \"One of them had, but the other was quite green in the business.\" \"You think then that I could succeed?\" \"Undoubtedly. You look smart and have a taking way with you. You can\u0027t fail to succeed.\" This was pleasant to hear, and Jed felt strongly impelled to engage in the service of the plausible Higgins. \"If you will trust me with twenty packages,\" he said, \"I will see what I can do.\" \"Certainly. That will be three dollars. You see we charge you fifteen cents each, and you sell them for twenty-five. That gives you two dollars. You had better take fifty packages, and then you won\u0027t have to come back to-morrow.\" \"Very well, I will take fifty.\" \"All right. You may pay me seven dollars and a half, and I will get the packages ready.\" \"Do you require payment in advance?\" asked Jed quickly. [Pg 240] \"Certainly. You are a stranger to me, and even if you were not, I should not feel like risking so much money or money\u0027s worth. What is there to hinder your making off with it and never coming back?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be dishonest for a great deal more money than that.\" \"I dare say you are right, but we must adhere to our business methods. You will get your money back in two days probably.\" \"But I haven\u0027t the money to pay in advance.\" \"Oh, that alters the matter,\" said Higgins, become less gracious. \"How much have you?\" \"I am unable to pay anything,\" said Jed desperately. Mr. Hugo Higgins turned away, no longer interested in Jed. Poor Jed felt sadly disappointed at losing so good a chance, but something happened to mitigate his regret. A stout man with red hair opened the door of the office and dashed in, carrying in his hands a large package. \"I want my money back!\" he said. \"You are a big schwindler!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82179.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
