{"id":12517,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. A STRANGE COMMISSION.","content":"Jed\u0027s companion on the seat was a sallow-faced, black-bearded man. Jed merely glanced at him, but presently became aware that he had become the object of the sallow man\u0027s scrutiny. Finally the latter moved rather nearer Jed, and showed a disposition to be sociable. \"A fine day, young man,\" he began. \"Yes, sir.\" \"And a fine view we have before us,\" went on the stranger, pointing to the harbor and the numerous craft that were passing in both directions. \"However, I suppose it is quite familiar to you?\" \"No, sir; I am a stranger in the city.\" \"Indeed!\" and here the stranger allowed his gaze to rest on the small gripsack that Jed had placed on the seat beside him. \"Perhaps you have come in quest of work?\" [Pg 251] \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jed. \"Have you found anything yet?\" \"No, sir, but I have only been here since yesterday morning. Do you know of any situation that I could fill?\" \"Well, no, no permanent position,\" answered the other deliberately. \"I might give you a chance to earn,\" here he hesitated, \"two dollars this evening. But perhaps that would not be worth your while.\" \"Yes, sir, I should be glad to earn even that,\" said Jed eagerly. \"Then perhaps I may employ you. Can you row a boat?\" \"Yes, sir. I think so. I have rowed on a pond up in Scranton.\" \"Then you can probably row here. I would row part of the way myself.\" \"When do you want me?\" asked Jed. \"Not till late this evening. I will explain when the time comes.\" Jed was disappointed. He had hoped to do the work at once, and receive the money. Then he could buy himself some supper, for he was already hungry. He found that his[Pg 252] appetite was just as regular as if he were earning a living income, instead of being impecunious and without work. \"At what time shall I meet you, sir?\" \"At eleven o\u0027clock, here.\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jed, wondering what he was to do during the intervening time. As he had no money, he must defer eating till then, and it occurred to him that he would hardly feel able to row any considerable distance unless refreshed by food. Could he venture to ask a part of the sum he was to earn in advance? He decided to do so. \"I am going to ask a favor,\" he said hurriedly. \"I have been robbed of all my money, and I have not enough to buy my supper. If you let me have half a dollar on account——\" He feared that this proposal would be distasteful to his companion, but the sallow-faced man did not seem offended. \"Perhaps,\" he said thoughtfully, \"I had better keep you with me, and let you eat supper with me.\" \"Very well, sir,\" said Jed, feeling relieved. [Pg 253] The other looked relieved. \"It is half-past five,\" he said. \"We may as well start now.\" He rose leisurely from his seat, and Jed followed him. He walked to the head of the Battery, and keeping near the piers, led the way to a humble tavern called \"The Sailor\u0027s Rest.\" \"This will do,\" he said. \"It is not very fashionable, but they can give us a comfortable meal.\" Certainly the interior presented a great contrast to the Astor House, where Jed had lunched, or rather dined. The floor was sanded, the tables were unprovided with tablecloths. There was a bar on one side of the room, over which presided a stout bartender with mottled cheeks and a dirty white apron. \"Where is the restaurant?\" asked Jed\u0027s companion. \"In there,\" answered the bartender with a jerk of his finger in the direction of a back room. With a nod the sallow-faced man beckoned[Pg 254] Jed to follow him. Opening a door, he led the way into a room provided with four tables only. On each table was a small bell. Jed and his guide sat down, and the latter rang the bell. A dirty-faced man, with a beard of several days\u0027 growth, made his appearance. \"We want some supper.\" \"What\u0027ll you have?\" \"What can we have?\" \"Beefsteak, ham and eggs.\" \"What else?\" \"Eggs without.\" \"Without what?\" \"Ham.\" The sallow man shrugged his shoulders. \"It seems we must choose between beefsteak and ham and eggs,\" he said. \"What will you have?\" \"Ham and eggs,\" answered Jed. \"All right. Ham and eggs for two.\" \"Anything else?\" \"Two bottles of lager. You drink beer, don\u0027t you?\" \"No,\" answered Jed. [Pg 255] \"Then bring the boy some tea or coffee—whichever he prefers.\" \"Tea,\" suggested Jed. \"Bread and butter, of course, and fried potatoes, if you can get them ready.\" While they were waiting the man leaned back in his chair and stared out of the window at a dirty back yard, but his thoughts seemed to be otherwise occupied. Jed\u0027s eyes wandered about the room, but found little to attract him in the two or three prints—one of a yacht, another of a merchant vessel—that adorned the walls. On the mantel was a soiled piece of coral and a large seashell. All seemed to harmonize with the name of the inn. Jed, however, felt but a fleeting interest in the furnishings of the place. His mind dwelt rather on the promised supper. He could not understand how in this crisis of his fortunes, when there was so much to discourage him, he should have such an appetite. Savory odors from the neighboring kitchen found their way into the room when the waiter opened the door and entered to set the table. [Pg 256] Jed was glad to overlook the cheap and dark-hued crockery, the rusty knives and forks and the chipped glasses, as the odor of the ham and eggs was wafted to his nostrils. Finally the beer and tea were brought in, and his companion signaled to him to fall to. \"Where did you dine?\" he asked abruptly. \"At the Astor House.\" The sallow-faced man paused with his glass, which he had just filled, half-way to his lips. \"Was that before you were robbed of your money?\" he asked. \"No, sir, but I met a gentleman whom I knew at the seaside, and he invited me to dine with him.\" \"Oh, that explains it. This is a very different place from the Astor House.\" \"I should think so,\" said Jed smiling. \"Still we can probably satisfy our hunger.\" \"Oh, yes,\" responded Jed, and he made a vigorous onslaught on the contents of his plate. In a few minutes supper was over, and Jed felt better. It is wonderful how much more cheerful views we take of life and the world on a full than on an empty stomach. [Pg 257] Jed experienced this. He couldn\u0027t, to be sure, look very far ahead, but he had had three meals that day in spite of an empty purse, and the money he was to earn would insure him a bed and three meals for the coming day, in all probability. \"It is half-past six\" said his companion, referring to his watch—\"a good while before I shall need your services. Do you feel tired?\" \"Yes, sir; I have been on my feet all day.\" \"Wait a minute.\" He went out and returned in a moment. \"I have engaged a room for you,\" he said. \"You can occupy it now if you like it, and after our expedition return to pass the balance of the night. You can leave your valise there, as it will only be in your way on the boat.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" This solved one of Jed\u0027s problems in a pleasant manner. The waiter led the way up stairs to a small room just large enough to hold a bed and washstand, and said, \"That\u0027ll do you, I guess.\" \"Oh yes,\" responded Jed cheerfully. [Pg 258] \"The gentleman says you can lie down, and he\u0027ll call you when you\u0027re wanted.\" Jed was glad of this permission, for he felt very much in need of rest. He took off his coat and laid down on the bed. The couch he found not a very luxurious one. It consisted of a thin—a very thin—mattress laid upon wooden slats, and the pillow was meagre. But he soon fell asleep, and slept so soundly that it seemed as if only five minutes had elapsed when some one shook him, and opening his eyes, they rested on his sallow-faced employer. \"Time to get up,\" said the latter abruptly. Jed sprang from the bed, and, his eyes only half open, said, \"I am ready.\" \"Follow me, then.\" He followed his guide, who walked rapidly through the dark streets till he reached a pier not far from the Battery. There was a boat moored alongside, rising and falling with the tide. There was one man already in it. \"Come along!\" said his guide briefly. Jed descended a ladder, and took his place in the boat. His companion seized the oars,[Pg 259] signing to Jed to take his seat in the bow. Then he began to row, much better then Jed could have done. They struck out towards Governor\u0027s Island, passed it, and proceeded a considerable distance beyond. Here lay a yacht. There was no light on board, so far as Jed could see, and it looked to be quite deserted. The rower slackened his speed (he had not yet called upon Jed to row) and said quickly: \"I want you to board that yacht. Go down into the cabin. There you will see a box, perhaps a foot square and ten inches deep. Bring it to me.\" \"But,\" said Jed, in bewilderment, \"is—is it yours?\" \"No,\" answered the sallow-faced man composedly. \"It belongs to a friend of mine, the owner of the yacht. I promised to come out and get it for him.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82181.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
