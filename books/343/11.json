{"id":12500,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. JED\u0027S FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE STAGE.","content":"Several gentlemen were sitting on the piazza in front of the hotel. Among them was Jed\u0027s acquaintance of the night before, Harry Bertram. When he saw Mr. Mordaunt in the buggy he advanced to greet him. \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Mordaunt,\" he said. \"I wanted to consult you.\" \"Any hitch, Bertram?\" asked the manager. \"Yes. Young Clinton is sick and can\u0027t play to-night.\" \"What\u0027s the matter with the boy?\" \"He is threatened with fever.\" \"Couldn\u0027t he play to-night? His part is a small one, but it is important.\" \"The doctor absolutely forbids his appearing on the stage.\" \"That is awkward. If we were in the city[Pg 97] we might get a substitute, but a common country boy would make a mess of the part.\" \"You have a boy with you. Do you think he would do?\" \"You have known him longer than I. I refer the matter to you.\" \"Why, it\u0027s Jed!\" exclaimed Bertram, examining our hero closely. \"Didn\u0027t you know me, Mr. Bertram?\" asked Jed smilingly. \"Who could, with such a change of dress? You must have met some good fairy. And how did you fall in with Mr. Mordaunt?\" \"He kindly offered me a ride.\" \"Then you have left Scranton for good?\" \"For good, I hope. If I can help you in any way I will do my best.\" \"Try him, Bertram,\" said the manager. \"He is very presentable. Take him in hand, and see if you can\u0027t get him ready to take Ralph Clinton\u0027s place.\" \"Then no time is to be lost. Come up to my room, Jed, and I will tell you what you are expected to do—that is, if you have had supper.\" [Pg 98] \"I ate my supper on the road before I fell in with Mr. Mordaunt.\" \"Follow me, then, Jed.\" Harry Bertram led the way to a comfortable chamber on the second floor. \"Now sit down, and I\u0027ll tell you what you will have to do. First, do you think you have the nerve to stand before an audience and play the part of a telegraph boy?\" \"Yes, sir. I am not troubled with bashfulness.\" \"Have you ever spoken in public?\" \"Yes, at school examinations.\" \"Then I think you\u0027ll do. Here is your part.\" He handed Jed a small manuscript book containing the lines of his r?le, with the cues. \"You see it isn\u0027t long. I may be able to give you a little rehearsal, as you appear only in the first and last acts.\" The next half hour was devoted to teaching Jed his part. Bertram was delighted with the aptitude shown by his pupil. \"Have you never attended a theatre?\" he asked, almost incredulously. [Pg 99] \"Never, Mr. Bertram.\" \"Then I can only say that you have the dramatic instinct, luckily for us. If you are sure you won\u0027t be afraid before the footlights, you\u0027ll do.\" \"Then I shall do,\" said Jed. \"I never should think of being nervous.\" \"One thing more—nothing will be said of any substitution. To the audience you will be Ralph Clinton, as put down on the bill.\" \"That will suit me. I am afraid if I were announced as Jed, the Poorhouse Boy, it wouldn\u0027t help you,\" continued Jed with a smile. \"You may have to continue in the part a week or more. As to the pay, I can\u0027t speak of that yet. Mr. Mordaunt will arrange with you.\" \"If I can earn my board I shall be satisfied.\" \"I can promise you that, and fully as good board as you have been accustomed to.\" \"I hope it won\u0027t be worse,\" said Jed laughing. \"When you go to the theatre I will see if[Pg 100] Ralph Clinton\u0027s uniform will fit you. I haven\u0027t much doubt on that point, as you seem to be about the same size.\" The performance was to commence at eight. Harry Bertram and his protégé went to the hall, which was to be used as a theatre, early, so that Jed might be introduced to his fellow-actors and receive a little instruction as to the business of his part. He was very quick to comprehend, and forgot nothing, so that Bertram felt quite easy in regard to him, though it was his first appearance on any stage. Jed was very well received by the other members of the company, all of whom expressed satisfaction at having the gap so quickly filled. \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, my boy,\" said George Osprey, the leading man. \"Where have you played?\" \"Nowhere, sir. This is my first appearance.\" \"I hope you won\u0027t funk.\" \"If that means break down, I am sure I won\u0027t.\" [Pg 101] \"Good! Your confidence will pull you through.\" \"Mr. Osprey, introduce me, please,\" lisped an elderly young lady, of affected manners. \"This is Miss Celesta Raffles, Mr. ——, I don\u0027t think I know your name.\" \"Jed Gilman, but I believe I am to be billed as Ralph Clinton.\" \"I am delighted to meet you, Mr. Gilman,\" said Miss Raffles. \"I am sure you will be an honor to our noble profession.\" \"I hope so, Miss Raffles,\" said Jed smilingly, \"but I shall be able to tell better to-morrow.\" \"I always sympathize with youth—with impulsive, enthusiastic youth,\" gushed Miss Raffles. \"If they are of the male sex,\" interpolated Mr. Osprey. \"Mr. Gilman, I must warn you that Miss Raffles is a dangerous woman. She will do her best to make an impression on your heart.\" \"Oh, you wicked slanderer!\" said the delighted Celesta. \"Mr. Gilman, I am not dangerous at all. I will merely ask you to[Pg 102] look upon me as your sister—your elder sister.\" \"Thank you, Miss Raffles,\" said Jed, showing a tact and self-possession hardly to be expected of one with his training. \"Is Mr. Osprey one of your brothers?\" \"Yes, she told me that she would be a sister to me. I have never—never recovered from the blow.\" \"I may change my mind,\" said Celesta, who admired the handsome leading man. \"If you try again, you may meet with better success——\" \"No,\" answered Osprey warily. \"I never ask the same favor a second time. I leave you to Mr. Gilman. May you be happy, my children!\" As Celesta Raffles looked to be thirty-five, and Jed was but sixteen, he was a good deal amused, but Miss Raffles was disposed to take the matter in earnest. \"Don\u0027t let him prejudice you against me, Mr. Gilman!\" she murmured. \"We shall soon be better acquainted, I am sure. Do you know, I am to be your mother in the play?[Pg 103] It is a little absurd, as I am only twenty-three, but we have to do strange things on the stage.\" \"She\u0027s thirty-six if she\u0027s a day,\" whispered Osprey, \"but if you want to keep in her good graces you must believe her own reports of her age.\" \"Time to dress, Jed!\" said Harry Bertram. \"It will take you longer than usual, as it is the first time. Your nerve won\u0027t fail you, will it?\" Jed shook his head. \"I feel as cool as ever I did,\" he answered. Fortunately the telegraph boy\u0027s uniform fitted him exactly. He hardly knew himself as he looked at his reflection in the little mirror in his dressing-room. \"I wonder if Mr. and Mrs. Fogson would recognize me if they should see me on the stage?\" thought Jed. Then it occurred to him that Percy Dixon and his mother would be present. He smiled to himself as he thought of Percy\u0027s bewilderment when he saw him under such a strange change of circumstances. [Pg 104] It is not necessary to give the plot of the Gold King. It is sufficient to say that Jed, the telegraph boy, had been stolen from his parents in early life, the Gold King being his father. He is obliged to earn his own living as a boy, but in the last act he is restored to his friends and his old station in life. In the first act Jed appeared in his predecessor\u0027s uniform. In the last he wore his own suit, this being quite as well adapted to the character as Ralph Clinton\u0027s street costume. Mrs. Dixon and Percy occupied seats in the third row from the front. They always paid the highest prices, and secured the most eligible seats. At the end of ten minutes Jed\u0027s cue was called and he appeared on the stage. Percy, who was watching the play with the greatest attention, started in amazement when he saw the boy actor. \"Mother,\" he whispered, \"that boy is the perfect image of Jed, the poorhouse boy.\" \"Is he, indeed? Very singular, on my word!\" [Pg 105] \"And he has the same voice,\" continued Percy, still more excited. \"But I suppose it can\u0027t be he,\" said Mrs. Dixon inquiringly. \"No, I think not,\" answered Percy. \"Jed doesn\u0027t know anything about acting, and this boy is perfectly at home on the stage.\" This was indeed true. Jed was quite self-possessed. Moreover, he never hesitated for a word or stumbled, but was letter-perfect. His scene was with George Osprey, as member of a fashionable club, who had inquired into his history. \"Yes,\" said Jed, repeating his part, \"yes, Mr. Glendower, I am a poor boy, but those who look down upon me will one day find their mistake—they may find that the poor telegraph boy whom they once despised is able to look down upon them.\" As he uttered these words, Jed, perhaps intentionally, let his glance rest on Percy Dixon, while the latter gazed at him open-mouthed. \"I believe it is Jed, after all, mother!\" he ejaculated.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82164.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
