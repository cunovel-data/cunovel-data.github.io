{"id":12526,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. JANE GILMAN.","content":"The visitor took a seat in the rocking-chair offered her by Mrs. Avery. \"Do you remember me?\" she asked, throwing back her veil so as to give an unobstructed view of her full, florid face. \"Are you the girl who brought the boy Jed to me fourteen years ago?\" \"The same. I don\u0027t find you in your old place.\" \"No; we—my husband and I—left the poor farm about a year since. Have you been there?\" \"Yes, I saw the new woman, and a spiteful piece she is, I\u0027ll be bound.\" Mrs. Avery smiled. \"I don\u0027t admire Mrs. Fogson,\" she said, \"but I suppose that is natural.\" \"She tells me the boy is no longer in the poorhouse.\" [Pg 329] \"No.\" \"Can you tell me why he left?\" \"He was ill-treated by Mr. and Mrs. Fogson.\" \"That woman tells me he was very troublesome.\" \"We never found him so, and up to a year ago he was under our charge.\" \"I surmised as much. Then he has grown up a good boy?\" \"Excellent. I feel great affection for Jed.\" \"That is gratifying to my feelings, seeing I am his aunt.\" Mrs. Avery regarded her visitor with surprise. \"Do you claim Jed as your nephew?\" she asked. \"Certainly. He is the son of my only brother.\" But for her interview with the detective Mrs. Avery would have believed this story. As it was, she did not choose to dispute it. She only sought to draw out her visitor so as to understand better her object in calling. \"Are you willing to explain why it was[Pg 330] that you were led to place your nephew under my care?\" \"Certainly. There is no secret about that now. My brother, who was a blacksmith, failed, and was unable to support the boy.\" \"What was your brother\u0027s name?\" \"Jedediah Gilman. That is why I desired to have the boy called Jed Gilman, after his father. My name is Jane Gilman.\" \"Then you are not married?\" \"No,\" said Miss Gilman. \"Not but I might have been married half a dozen times if I had wanted to. But the men are a shiftless lot, in my opinion.\" \"Not all of them. I never charged my husband with being shiftless.\" \"Oh, well, there are exceptions. But I liked my freedom, so I am Jane Gilman still. I may change my mind yet, and get married. There\u0027s a many after me, and I am only thirty-two.\" Mrs. Avery was too polite to question her statement, but privately decided that the other was ten years older. \"Are you an American?\" she asked. [Pg 331] \"No, I\u0027m English, and I\u0027m proud to own it.\" \"Was Jed born in England?\" Jane Gilman hesitated, but finally answered in the affirmative. \"In what English town or village was he born?\" \"Oh, lor, you wouldn\u0027t know any better if I should tell you. My brother came over here with Jed when he was a baby, to better his fortunes. He went out to Iowa, leaving the baby with me. But I found I couldn\u0027t get a place with a baby on my hands, and so I took it to the Scranton poorhouse.\" \"And where have you been since?\" \"I went to Philadelphia and got a position there. Since then I\u0027ve been in a many places.\" \"I wonder you didn\u0027t write to me for some news of the baby.\" \"I got news of him from time to time, though I don\u0027t mean to tell you how,\" answered Jane Gilman with a cunning smile. \"But I\u0027ve been away for the last three years, and so I didn\u0027t know that Jed had gone off.\" [Pg 332] \"You must be disappointed not to find him.\" \"So I am. It seems so long since I\u0027ve seen the dear child,\" and Jane drew out a handkerchief of ample size and pressed it to her tearless eyes. \"Is he a nice-looking boy?\" \"He has a fine, frank, open face, but you\u0027ll excuse my saying that he doesn\u0027t resemble you in the least.\" \"No,\" answered Jane, not the least bit disconcerted. \"He didn\u0027t look like the Gilmans, but like his ma\u0027s family.\" \"What was his mother\u0027s maiden name?\" \"Fenwick,\" responded Jane Gilman, having no suspicion that Mrs. Avery had heard the name before. Mrs. Avery started. \"I\u0027ve heard that name before,\" she said. \"Have you?\" asked Jane, momentarily uneasy, but quickly recovering her self-possession she reflected that the Averys could not possibly know anything of Jed\u0027s real history. \"I suppose there\u0027s a many Fenwicks in the world and some of \u0027em in America. My[Pg 333] brother\u0027s wife was a good-looking woman, and the boy takes after her.\" \"She died young, I suppose?\" \"Only three months after he was born.\" \"Is your brother still living?\" \"No; he was killed in a railroad accident out in Iowa six months since. He was a brakeman on the railroad. He left me a tidy sum of money, and said that I was to look up Jed.\" \"This accounts for your visit, then?\" \"Yes; I want to take my nephew with me and see to his education, as my brother wished me to.\" \"Did Mrs. Fogson give you any idea where he was?\" \"She said he had run away, but she had information that he was at Bar Harbor, wherever that is, in the service of some rich gentleman.\" \"We have heard the same thing. What do you propose to do?\" \"I\u0027ll have to go there, I suppose. But there is one thing I want to ask you about.\" \"What is that?\" [Pg 334] \"When I left the baby with you there was a gold locket suspended from his neck. Did you find it?\" \"Yes, I found it.\" \"I\u0027ll thank you if you\u0027ll give it to me. I meant to take it at the time, but I went away in a hurry, as you know, and I thought it would be safe in your hands.\" \"I can\u0027t let you have it to-day, Miss Gilman.\" \"And why not?\" demanded Jane suspiciously. \"I deposited it with a party I had confidence in, for safe keeping,\" replied Mrs. Avery. \"Then I\u0027ll be glad to have you get it as soon as you can. I want it,\" rejoined Jane Gilman sharply. \"How am I to feel sure you are entitled to it?\" asked Mrs. Avery. \"If I am not, who is, I\u0027d like to know? I\u0027m the one that left the boy with you at the poorhouse.\" \"I presume this is true.\" \"Of course it\u0027s true. I\u0027ll tell you what,[Pg 335] Mrs. Avery, I\u0027m not much pleased with your trying to keep the locket. Are you sure you haven\u0027t sold or pawned it?\" \"Yes, I am sure of that. But perhaps I shall not have to make you wait long for it. The gentleman in whose hands I placed it is in this house at this very minute.\" Jane Gilman looked very much surprised. \"Where is he?\" she asked. Detective Peake answered for himself. He stepped into the room from the small bedroom and held up the locket. \"Is this the one?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" answered the woman eagerly. \"Give it to me.\" Mr. Peake quietly put it back into his pocket. \"Not till I have asked you a few questions,\" he answered. \"What right have you to ask me questions?\" asked Jane defiantly. \"I will assume that I have the right,\" the detective answered. \"Whose miniatures are those in the locket?\" \"They are my brother and his wife.\" [Pg 336] \"Your brother doesn\u0027t seem to look like you, Miss Gilman.\" \"Perhaps you know better than I who it is,\" said Jane sullenly. \"Well, perhaps so.\" \"And who do you say they are?\" \"Sir Charles and Laura Fenwick of Fenwick Hall, England.\" Jane Gilman started to her feet in astonishment. \"Who told you?\" she asked hoarsely. \"It is not necessary for me to tell you. It is enough that I am commissioned by the boy\u0027s mother to find him and restore him to her. There may be trouble in store for you, Miss Jane Gilman,\" he added significantly. Jane Gilman fanned herself vigorously and seemed very ill at ease. \"However,\" continued the detective, \"you can save yourself and secure a handsome reward by giving me all the help you can, and making full confession of your stealing the child, and telling who instigated you to do it.\" The woman hesitated, but her hesitation was brief. \"Will you promise this?\" she asked. \"Yes. I am the confidential agent of Lady Fenwick, who is now in America.\" \"Then I\u0027ll do it. Guy Fenwick hasn\u0027t treated me right, and I don\u0027t mind if I do go back on him. It was he that hired me to make off with little Robert, though I didn\u0027t let him know what I did with him.\" \"And what was your present object?\" \"To take the boy away and make Sir Guy pay a good round sum for my keeping the secret.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82190.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
