{"id":12523,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. THE DETECTIVE.","content":"The man in drab smiled to himself as he left the presence of Mrs. Fogson. \"I wonder whether that woman\u0027s husband has her amiable traits?\" he speculated. \"If so, the Scranton poor must be made very uncomfortable.\" As he reached the village he met Percy Dixon once more. Percy had an ungovernable curiosity, and he crossed the street to intercept the stranger. \"I suppose you found the poorhouse,\" he said suggestively. \"Yes; I could not miss it after your clear directions.\" \"Are you related to Mr. and Mrs. Fogson?\" asked Percy, rather boldly. \"Well no,\" answered the stranger with a smile. \"I haven\u0027t the honor.\" [Pg 309] \"Have you any relations among the paupers?\" \"Not that I am aware of. However, I called to inquire after one of them—a boy.\" \"Jed Gilman?\" said Percy eagerly. \"Yes; I believe that is his name. Are you acquainted with him?\" \"I have known him for years.\" \"I suppose he is a friend of yours?\" \"Not much. Do you think I would be friends with a pauper?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I see no reason why not if he is a nice boy.\" \"But Jed isn\u0027t a nice boy. He\u0027s an artful, forward, presuming young jackanapes, and was awfully troublesome.\" \"I am sorry to hear it. Mrs. Fogson seems to think of him very much as you do.\" \"I should think she would. She and Fogson couldn\u0027t do anything with him.\" \"Mrs. Fogson says he isn\u0027t there now.\" \"No; he ran away after making a brutal assault on Fogson.\" The man in drab felt an inclination to smile, but suppressed it. [Pg 310] \"I don\u0027t know as I ought to have spoken against him,\" continued Percy with a cunning look of inquiry. \"You may be after him.\" The man in drab paused a moment, then assuming a look of mystery, said, \"Can you keep a secret?\" \"Yes,\" answered Percy eagerly. \"Come here, then.\" Percy drew near, and the other whispered mysteriously, \"I am a detective!\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ejaculated Percy, gazing at him with a species of awe, begotten of his idea of detectives as introduced into books which he had read. The other nodded. \"And I am after Jed Gilman!\" he continued. \"Is that so?\" said the delighted Percy. \"What has he done?\" \"That is a secret which I am not permitted to reveal at present.\" \"Do you want to find him?\" \"Very much.\" \"Then I\u0027ll tell you where he is. He\u0027s gone to Bar Harbor—in Maine, you know.\" [Pg 311] The detective nodded. \"He went on a yacht—the Juno—owned by Mr. Schuyler Roper—a rich New York gentleman.\" \"But how did he get into such company?\" \"Oh, Mr. Roper took pity on him and gave him a place.\" \"Then you think he is comfortably situated?\" \"Yes, but he won\u0027t be long.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I have written a letter to Mr. Roper, telling him Jed\u0027s real character. I expect he\u0027ll be bounced when that letter arrives.\" \"That would upset all my plans and enable him to escape.\" Percy looked perplexed and disappointed. \"I am sorry for that,\" he said. \"I guess I\u0027d better write again and tell him to keep Jed another week.\" \"Perhaps you had better do so. Say that—— But no. I will telegraph to him to keep Jed with him till I arrive.\" \"That\u0027ll do better. You couldn\u0027t possibly tell me what Jed has done?\" [Pg 312] \"Not at present.\" \"You\u0027ll let me know sometime?\" \"I think I shall be able to gratify your curiosity before long.\" \"I\u0027ll give you my address, and you can write to me. I wish I knew whether Jed had stolen anything or not.\" \"I cannot say a word! My lips are sealed!\" said the detective in a solemn tone. Percy was impressed. The man in drab quite came up to his idea of a detective. \"By the way,\" said his companion, \"I want to call on Mr. and Mrs. Avery, who, I understand, know something of the boy\u0027s early life.\" \"They live there—in that small house. I\u0027ll go with you.\" \"No, I prefer to go alone. One can\u0027t be too careful.\" \"All right,\" said Percy. \"I wonder what under the canopy Jed\u0027s been doing? It\u0027s likely he\u0027ll have to go to jail.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82187.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
