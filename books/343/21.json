{"id":12510,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. JED ARRIVES IN NEW YORK.","content":"Jed counted over his money and found he had thirty-nine dollars and thirty-seven cents. He would have had more, but he had supplied himself with clothes, so that he was on the whole very well provided in that way. He resolutely refused to borrow from Harry Bertram, though the actor pressed a loan upon him. \"No, Harry,\" he said, \"I have almost forty dollars, and I am sure that will last me till I can earn some more.\" \"Well, perhaps so,\" replied the actor, \"but you have no idea how fast money melts away. What are your plans?\" \"I am afraid I haven\u0027t any,\" answered Jed, looking perplexed. \"I want to make a living, but I don\u0027t know what I am fit for.\" \"Where do you mean to go?\" \"I think I should like to go to New[Pg 183] York,\" answered Jed. \"I have never been there.\" \"You will find the city very dull at this time of year. Business is very quiet in August.\" \"But there must be a good many chances in a city of over a million inhabitants.\" \"Well, perhaps you may as well find out for yourself. I am afraid you will be disappointed.\" Jed attached considerable importance to the opinion of his friend Bertram, but in his own mind there was a conviction that the other exaggerated the chances of failure. He was of a sanguine temperament himself, and this made him hopeful. There were two ways of reaching New York from Sea Spray. One was a combination of cars and boat, the other took one all the way by steamer. This, on the whole, Jed preferred. With his modest gripsack in his hand he passed over the gang-plank and took a seat forward. Next to him was a tall, thin man, dressed in shabby attire, who did not appear[Pg 184] to have shaved for several days. Though the weather was warm, he had his coat buttoned tight across his chest, possibly to conceal the lack of a vest. When the boat had been perhaps fifteen minutes under way, he turned and eyed Jed with some attention. \"Are you staying at Sea Spray this summer, young man?\" he asked. \"I have spent some weeks there,\" answered Jed. \"I suppose you are going to New York for the day?\" \"No; I am going for good. That is I hope I am going for good.\" \"You are going to fill a business position, perhaps?\" \"I hope so, but I have none engaged.\" \"Are you acquainted in New York?\" \"No; I have never been there. This will be my first visit.\" \"Indeed! This is very interesting. I should be glad to help you to a position.\" Jed thought privately that his new acquaintance must stand quite as much in need[Pg 185] of a place as he, but courtesy led him to say, \"Thank you.\" \"Have you any particular choice as to the business you take up?\" \"No; anything that will enable me to pay my expenses will satisfy me.\" \"Just so. You have heard of H. B. Claflin, probably?\" \"Yes; he is a dry goods merchant.\" \"On a very large scale. I have a mind to give you a letter to him.\" \"Do you know him?\" asked Jed doubtfully. \"Yes; Horace and I used to go to school together. He was older than I, but we were pretty intimate.\" \"Why don\u0027t you apply for a position for yourself?\" \"Dry goods are not in my line. I am an editor—that is, an editorial writer.\" \"Indeed!\" Jed had read from time to time squibs and witty paragraphs touching the poverty of editors, and this seemed to explain the shabby appearance of his new friend. \"What paper do you write for?\" he ventured to ask. \"I contribute editorially to most of the city dailies. Sometimes I get as high as fifteen and twenty dollars a column.\" Jed was rather surprised at this. He concluded that Mr. Hamilton Barry—for this was the name the stranger had given—was not a very good financial manager. \"That seems a high price,\" said Jed. \"Yes, but brain-work ought to be paid handsomely. Do you ever write for publication yourself?\" \"Oh, no,\" said Jed, flattered nevertheless by the question. \"I haven\u0027t education enough.\" \"I thought if you did I might get you something to do. But perhaps business is more in your line?\" \"I think it will be.\" \"Then I had better write you a note to Mr. Claflin. When we get to the city I will run into some hotel and write you a letter of recommendation.\" \"But, Mr. Barry, you don\u0027t know me. How can you recommend me?\" \"My dear boy, I judge you by your appearance. Besides, I know something of phrenology, and you have a good head—a very good head. I read in it honesty, integrity, enterprise and fidelity. Those qualities certainly ought to qualify you to succeed in business.\" \"I don\u0027t know anything about phrenology, but I hope it\u0027s true.\" \"My young friend you may rely implicitly on the verdict of the wonderful science.\" \"I shall be glad to,\" said Jed smiling, \"since, as you say, it is so favorable to me.\" When they reached the pier Hamilton Barry passed his arm familiarly through Jed\u0027s, and led the way to a small public house, the office of which seemed also to be a bar. \"Won\u0027t you take a glass of something?\" asked the editor. \"I don\u0027t drink,\" answered Jed, rather embarrassed. \"Take a glass of sarsaparilla. It won\u0027t harm an infant.\" \"Thank you. I don\u0027t mind.\" Upon this Mr. Barry stepped up to the bar[Pg 188] and ordered one sarsaparilla and one whisky straight. While Jed was solemnly drinking the first, the editor poured down the whisky at one gulp. Then he felt in his pockets for the fifteen cents which were due. But somehow no silver was forthcoming. \"Upon my word,\" he exclaimed, \"I must have left my money at home. Mr. Gilman, can you oblige me with a quarter?\" Jed produced the required coin. Taking it, Barry paid the score, and quietly pocketed the change. \"Now for the letter!\" he said. \"Where is your writing-room?\" \"Haven\u0027t got any,\" answered the barkeeper. \"Can\u0027t you scare up a sheet of paper and an envelope?\" After some time these were produced, also a pen and a bottle of ink. Barry sat down at one of the tables generally used for bar customers, and in a short time produced a letter which he handed to Jed. It ran thus: Dear Horace: This letter will be handed to you by a talented young friend, who is in search of a business position. Mr. J. Gilman is in my judgment possessed of superior business qualifications, and will prove a valuable man in your store. I advise you to engage him at once. Your old friend, Hamilton Barry. This note was placed in an envelope directed to Horace B. Claflin. In the corner Barry wrote: \"To introduce Mr. J. Gilman.\" \"There,\" he said. \"Take this letter round to Claflin and he will undoubtedly give you a good place.\" He spoke with so much confidence that Jed was led to think himself in luck to be the recipient of such a testimonial. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I feel very much obliged.\" \"Oh don\u0027t mention it!\" said Barry in an airy way. \"It gives me pleasure to assist you, Mr. Gilman, I assure you. When you have ascended round by round until you are at the top of the ladder, I trust you will not forget your chance acquaintance, Hamilton Barry.\" \"I certainly will not, Mr. Barry,\" said Jed warmly, grasping the hand of the editor. \"I hope some day to thank you as I wish.\" \"My dear boy, the sentiment does you credit. I know you are sincere.\" \"Certainly,\" said Jed. \"It is because I know this that I venture to suggest that you may do me a favor at once.\" \"What is it?\" \"Let me have a fiver till next Monday. I shall then call at the office of the Tribune for twenty dollars due me for two editorials published early this week.\" This request rather staggered Jed. Now that he had paid his fare to New York he had only about thirty-seven dollars, and five dollars would cut rather seriously into his small balance. \"I am afraid,\" he said awkwardly, \"that I can hardly spare five dollars. If two dollars would help you——\" \"It would materially,\" interposed Barry. \"Of course it is only a loan. Meet me here next Monday, at six o\u0027clock, say, after your[Pg 191] duties are over at Claflin\u0027s, and I will gladly repay you.\" This off-hand allusion to Claflin, taking for granted his engagement there, made Jed ashamed of his temporary distrust, and he drew from his pocketbook a two-dollar note, which he handed to Mr. Barry. \"Thanks,\" said the editor, as he carelessly slipped it into his pocket. \"Be here on Monday at six o\u0027clock sharp.\" Then with a jaunty air he touched his hat and walked rapidly around the corner. \"I think I will go around to Claflin\u0027s at once,\" decided Jed. \"I may as well strike while the iron is hot.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82174.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
