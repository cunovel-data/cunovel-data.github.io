{"id":12530,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XLI. CONCLUSION.","content":"Not the least gratifying circumstance in his sudden change of fortune was Jed\u0027s discovery of a mother—a gracious and beautiful woman—to whom he was drawn in almost instinctive affection. Before leaving New York for his native land he expressed a wish to revisit Scranton, and view once more the scenes of his early privations. His mother not only consented, but decided to accompany him. Mr. and Mrs. Fogson were engaged in their usual morning labors when a handsome carriage stopped at the gate. A servant descended and made his way to the front door, which Mrs. Fogson herself opened. \"Madam,\" said the servant bowing, \"do you receive visitors?\" Mrs. Fogson espying the handsome carriage was dazzled, and responded graciously: \"We ain\u0027t fixed for company,\" she said,[Pg 356] \"but if you\u0027ll make allowances I shall be happy to receive visitors. Who is it?\" she inquired curiously. \"Lady Fenwick and Sir Robert Fenwick, of Fenwick Hall, England.\" \"You don\u0027t say!\" ejaculated Mrs. Fogson, awe-stricken. \"Tell \u0027em to come right in.\" Jed assisted his mother to alight and walk up to the front door, Mrs. Fogson having retreated inside to change her dress. \"And you say you lived in this forlorn place, Robert?\" asked Lady Fenwick with a shudder. \"For fourteen years, mother.\" \"I never can forgive Guy Fenwick—never!\" \"I am none the worse for it now, mother.\" Jed led the way into Mrs. Fogson\u0027s private sitting-room, where that lady found them. She stopped short at the threshold. \"Why, it\u0027s Jed Gilman!\" she said sharply, with a feeling that she had been humbugged. \"Mrs. Fogson,\" said Jed, gravely, \"I am Jed Gilman no more. I have found out that I am entitled to a large estate in England, but[Pg 357] best of all I have found a mother, and am no longer alone in the world.\" Mr. Fogson, who had followed his wife into the room, was the first to \"take in\" the surprising news. Jed\u0027s handsome suit, his gold watch-chain and diamond scarf-pin, as well as his mother\u0027s stately figure, convinced him that the story was true. \"No one is more glad to hear of your good fortune, my dear boy, than Mrs. F. and myself,\" he said in a gushing tone. \"I have often thought that you were a nobleman in disguise.\" \"You never let me suspect it, Mr. Fogson,\" said Jed, amused. \"Probably you didn\u0027t want to raise my expectations.\" \"Just so, Jed, I mean Sir Robert. We feel that it was an honor to have you so long under our roof—don\u0027t we, Mrs. F.?\" \"Certainly, Simeon. If Lady Fenwick will permit me to offer an humble collation, some of my ginger snaps; you remember them, Jed, I mean Sir Robert.\" \"You are very kind,\" said Lady Fenwick hastily, \"but I seldom eat between meals.\" [Pg 358] Just then Percy Dixon, who came with a message from his father, appeared in the door. He opened his eyes wide in amazement when he saw Jed. \"Jed Gilman!\" he exclaimed in astonishment. \"No, Master Percy,\" said Mrs. Fogson. \"We have just learned that our dear Jed is Sir Robert Fenwick, of Fenwick Hall, England.\" \"Jehoshaphat!\" cried Percy, astounded. \"Percy,\" said Jed, whose good fortune made him good-natured, \"let me introduce you to my mother, Lady Fenwick. Mother, this is Master Percy Dixon.\" \"I am glad to meet any of your friends, Robert,\" said Lady Fenwick, really supposing that Jed and Percy were on intimate terms. \"Glad to know you—to make your acquaintance, Lady Fenwick,\" replied Percy. \"Are you really and truly a lord, Jed?\" \"No, not a lord, but a baronet. However, that needn\u0027t make any difference between friends like ourselves.\" [Pg 359] \"No, of course not. You know I always liked you, Jed, I mean Sir Jed.\" \"Sir Robert,\" prompted Mr. Fogson. \"Sir Robert. I feel sort of confused by the sudden change,\" explained Percy embarrassed. \"Call me Jed, then. In Scranton I mean to be Jed.\" \"Won\u0027t you call at our house? My father, Squire Dixon, will be honored by a visit.\" \"We are to call on Mr. and Mrs. Avery first, and then if we have time we will call on you. Won\u0027t you get into the carriage and go with us, Percy?\" Percy Dixon accepted the invitation with intense delight, and long afterwards boasted of his ride with Lady Fenwick. Though Jed and his mother were able to spend but ten minutes at the house of Squire Dixon, the squire showed himself deeply sensible of the honor, and several times alluded to his dear young friend Sir Robert. It was the way of the world. Mr. and Mrs. Avery received from Lady Fenwick a handsome present in recognition of their past kindness to Jed, and this was the first of many. [Pg 360] Jed and his mother remained at the Windsor till they were ready to embark for England. While walking on Fifth Avenue one day he saw just ahead his little friend, Chester Holbrook, accompanied by his aunt, Miss Maria Holbrook. He hurried forward, and taking off his hat to Miss Holbrook, said, \"Chester, don\u0027t you remember me?\" Chester uttered a cry of delight. \"Why it\u0027s Jed!\" he said. Miss Maria Holbrook, surprised at Jed\u0027s improved appearance, eyed him with suspicion. \"Where are you staying, Jedediah?\" she inquired. \"Have you a situation?\" \"I am boarding at the Windsor Hotel, Miss Holbrook. I am in no situation.\" \"Then how can you afford to board at a first-class hotel?\" asked the spinster in surprise. \"I am with my mother, Lady Fenwick. Allow me to hand you my card.\" Jed placed in her hand a card on which was engraved the name: Sir Robert Fenwick, Bart. The story had already appeared in the daily[Pg 361] papers of New York, but Miss Holbrook never suspected that the young English baronet was Chester\u0027s humble guardian. \"Are you Sir Robert Fenwick?\" she ejaculated in amazement. \"I believe so,\" he answered with a smile. \"Now, Miss Holbrook, I have a favor to ask. May I take Chester in and introduce him to my mother?\" \"I should also like to meet Lady Fenwick,\" said Miss Holbrook. \"I shall be most happy to present you.\" \"Isn\u0027t your name Jed after all?\" asked Chester, as he confidingly placed his hand in that of his former guardian. \"You may call me so, Chester; I wish you would.\" Miss Maria Holbrook was delighted with her visit. Like many Americans, she had a great respect for English aristocracy, and did not understand that there was considerable difference between titles. It is wonderful how differently she came to regard one whom she had been accustomed to style \"that boy Jedediah.\" She was much pleased with Lady[Pg 362] Fenwick\u0027s gracious reception, though she found it difficult to think of her as Jed\u0027s mother. I neglected to say in the proper place that Jed did not fail to call, when in Scranton, on his two friends Dr. and Mrs. Redmond, and gave them a cordial invitation to visit his mother and himself if they should ever come to England. He did not see fit to extend a similar invitation to Mr. and Mrs. Fogson. Misfortune has come to these worthy people. Their mismanagement of the poorhouse had become so notorious that the best citizens of Scranton not only demanded their removal from the poorhouse, but at the next town meeting defeated Squire Dixon for re-election to the position of Overseer of the Poor. Mr. and Mrs. Avery were invited to succeed the Fogsons, but felt that they were entitled to rest and quiet for the balance of their lives. The liberal gifts of Jed and his mother made them independent, and they were willing that younger persons should fill their old positions. Jed devoted several years to making up the[Pg 363] deficiencies in his education. The only disagreeable thing in his change of fortune was his removal from America, but he will probably arrange to spend a portion of his time in his adopted country, to which he feels the attachment of a loyal son. Then he has a link connecting him with it in the frequent visits at Fenwick Hall of his friend Schuyler Roper. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82194.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
