{"id":12497,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. MR. FOGSON IS ASTONISHED.","content":"The sleeper had already slept off pretty nearly all the effects of his potations, and the sudden cold bath restored him wholly to himself. But it also aroused in him a feeling of anger, justifiable under the circumstances, and, not belonging to the Peace Society, he was moved to punish the person to whom he was indebted for his unpleasant experience. With a smothered imprecation he sprang from the bed and seized the astonished Fogson by the throat, while he shook him violently. \"You—you—scoundrel!\" he ejaculated. \"I\u0027ll teach you to play such a scurvy trick on a gentleman.\" Mr. Fogson screamed in fright. He did not catch his late victim\u0027s words, and was still under the impression that it was Jed who had tackled him. [Pg 69] Meanwhile the intruder was flinging him about and bumping him against the floor so forcibly that Mrs. Fogson\u0027s attention was attracted. Indeed, she was at the foot of the stairs, desiring to enjoy Jed\u0027s dismay when drenched with the contents of the tin dipper. \"What\u0027s the matter, Simeon?\" she cried. \"Jed\u0027s killing me!\" called out Fogson in muffled tones. \"You don\u0027t mean to say you ain\u0027t a match for that boy!\" ejaculated Mrs. Fogson scornfully. \"I\u0027ll come up and help you.\" Disregarding her light attire she hurried up stairs, and was astonished beyond measure when she saw how unceremoniously her husband was being handled. She rushed to seize Jed, when she found her hands clutching a mustache. \"Why, it ain\u0027t Jed!\" she screamed in dismay. \"No, it ain\u0027t Jed,\" said the intruder. \"Did you mean that soaking for Jed, whoever he is?\" \"Yes, yes, it was—quite a mistake!\" gasped Fogson. [Pg 70] \"I am glad to hear you say so, for I meant to fling you down stairs, and might have broken your neck.\" \"Oh, what a dreadful man!\" ejaculated Mrs. Fogson. \"How came you here and where is Jed?\" \"I am here!\" answered Jed, who had waked up two or three minutes previous and was enjoying the defeat of his persecutor. \"Did you bring in this man?\" demanded Mrs. Fogson sternly. \"No. I walked in myself,\" answered the intruder. \"I was rather mellow—in other words I had drunk too much mixed ale, and I really didn\u0027t know where I was. I had an idea that this was a hotel.\" \"You made a mistake, sir. This is the Scranton poorhouse.\" \"So the boy told me when he came in. I wouldn\u0027t have taken a bed here if I had known your playful way of pouring cold water on your guests.\" \"Sir, apart from your assault on me, me, the master of the poorhouse,\" said Fogson, trying to recover some of his lost dignity,[Pg 71] \"you committed a trespass in entering the house without permission and appropriating a bed.\" \"All right, old man, but just remember that I was drunk.\" \"I don\u0027t think that is an excuse.\" \"Isn\u0027t it? Just get drunk yourself, and see what you\u0027ll do.\" \"I don\u0027t allow Mr. Fogson to get drunk,\" said his wife with asperity. \"Maybe my wife wouldn\u0027t let me, if there was any such a person, but I haven\u0027t been so fortunate as Mr. Fogson, if that is his name.\" \"Mrs. F.,\" said her husband with a sudden thought, \"you are not dressed for company.\" Mrs. Fogson, upon this hint, scuttled down stairs, and the intruder resumed: \"If I\u0027ve taken a liberty I\u0027m willing to apologize. What\u0027s more, I\u0027ll pay you fifty cents for the use of your bed and stay the night out.\" He was appealing to Mr. Fogson\u0027s weak point, which was a love of money. \"I see you\u0027re ready to do the square thing,\" he said in softened accents. \"If you\u0027ll say seventy-five——\" [Pg 72] \"No, I won\u0027t pay over fifty. I don\u0027t care to take it another night on those terms, if I am to be waked up by a dipper of water. You\u0027ve wet the sheet and pillow so that I may take my death of cold if I sleep here any longer.\" \"I\u0027ll bring you a comforter which you can lay over the wet clothes.\" \"All right! Bring it up and I\u0027ll hand you the fifty cents.\" \"And—and if you would like breakfast in the morning, for the small extra sum of twenty-five cents——\" \"Isn\u0027t that rather steep for a poorhouse breakfast?\" \"You will not eat with the paupers, of course, but at a private table, with Mrs. Fogson and myself.\" \"All right! Your offer is accepted.\" Mr. Fogson brought up the comforter, and the visitor resumed the slumbers which had been so unceremoniously interrupted. The sun rose early, and when its rays crept in through the side window both Jed and his companion were awake. [Pg 73] \"I say, boy, come over here and share my bed. I want to talk to you.\" Jed\u0027s curiosity was excited, and he accepted the invitation. He found his roommate to be a good-looking young man of perhaps thirty, and with a pleasant expression. \"So you are Jed?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir.\" \"And you live in the poorhouse?\" \"Yes,\" answered Jed, half-ashamed to admit it, \"but I don\u0027t mean to stay here.\" \"Good! A smart boy like you ought not to be a pauper. You are able to earn your own living outside. But perhaps you are attached to the queer people who made me a visit last night.\" \"Not much!\" answered Jed emphatically. \"I don\u0027t admire them much myself. I didn\u0027t see the old lady. Is she beautiful?\" Jed laughed heartily. \"You\u0027ll see her at the breakfast table,\" he said. \"Then you can judge for yourself.\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall do anything to excite Fogson\u0027s jealousy. Zounds, if this isn\u0027t the[Pg 74] queerest hotel I ever struck. I am sorry to have taken your bed from you.\" \"I was glad not to be in it when Mr. Fogson came up.\" \"You\u0027re right there,\" said the other laughing. \"Whew! how the cold water startled me. Sorry to have deprived you of it.\" \"Mr. Fogson got a dose himself yesterday, only it was hot water.\" \"You don\u0027t say so! Was that meant for you, too?\" \"Yes;\" and Jed told the story of his struggle with Mr. Fogson, and his wife\u0027s unfortunate interference. \"That\u0027s a capital joke,\" said the visitor laughing. \"Now I suppose you wonder who I am.\" \"Yes; I should like to know.\" \"I\u0027m Harry Bertram, the actor. I don\u0027t know if you ever heard of me.\" \"I never attended the theatre in my life.\" \"Is that so? Why, you\u0027re quite a heathen. Never went to a theatre? Well, I am surprised.\" \"Is it a good business?\" asked Jed. \"Sometimes, if the play happens to catch[Pg 75] on. When you are stranded five hundred miles from home, and your salary isn\u0027t paid, it isn\u0027t exactly hilarious.\" \"Are you going to play anywhere near here?\" asked Jed, who was beginning to think he would like to see a performance. \"We are billed to play in Duncan to-morrow evening, or rather this evening, for it\u0027s morning now.\" \"Duncan is only five miles away.\" \"If you want to attend I\u0027ll give you a pass. It\u0027s the least I can do to pay for turning you out of your bed.\" \"I could walk the five miles,\" said Jed. \"Then come. I\u0027ll see you at the door and pass you in. Ask for Harry Bertram.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Bertram.\" \"Old Fogson won\u0027t make a fuss about your going, will he?\" \"Yes, he will; but I\u0027ve made up my mind to leave the poorhouse, and I might as well leave it to-day as any time.\" \"Good! I admire your pluck.\" \"I wish I knew what I could do to make a living.\" [Pg 76] \"Leave that to me. I\u0027ll arrange to have you travel with the show for two or three days and bunk with me. Have you got any—any better clothes than those?\" and Bertram pointed to the dilapidated garments lying on a chair near by. \"Yes, I am promised a good suit by a friend of mine in the village. I\u0027ll go there and put them on before starting.\" \"Do; the actors sometimes look pretty tough, but I never saw one dressed like that.\" \"Jed!\" screamed Mrs. Fogson from the bottom of the stairs. \"You get right up and come down stairs!\" \"They\u0027re calling me,\" said Jed, starting up. \"Will I have to get up too?\" \"No; Mr. and Mrs. Fogson don\u0027t breakfast till seven. They\u0027ll send me up to call you.\" \"All right! We\u0027ll soon be travelling together where there are no Fogsons.\" \"I hope so,\" and Jed went down stairs with new life in his step.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2980/82161.html","bookId":343,"book":{"id":343,"title":"Jed, the Poorhouse Boy","description":"简介： Jed paused in his work with his axe suspended above him, for he was splitting wood.
