{"id":12508,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. DISCHARGED.","content":"In a front room on the second floor of the Spray Hotel sat Miss Maria Holbrook with a letter in her hand. It was written on the cheapest note-paper, and inclosed in a plebeian brown envelope. Of course it will be understood that it was the epistolary effort of Mr. Simeon Fogson. \"Just as I thought!\" soliloquized the lady. \"This boy seems to be a disreputable character of the lowest antecedents, and utterly unworthy to associate even as a servant with a member of my family.\" Here Chester entered in his usual impetuous manner. \"Oh, Aunt Maria,\" he cried, \"I had a bully bath.\" \"I am shocked to hear you use such a low term as \u0027bully,\u0027 Chester,\" said his aunt. \"No doubt you learned it of Jedediah.\" [Pg 168] \"No, I didn\u0027t. Jed never uses the word. At least I never heard him.\" \"Will you tell Jedediah that I wish to see him at once on important business?\" \"It seems funny to hear you call him Jedediah, Aunt Maria.\" \"I apprehend that it is his right name; \u0027Jed\u0027 sounds low.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll tell him to come up.\" When Jed made his appearance Miss Holbrook said: \"You may go below, Chester. I wish to speak to Jedediah in private.\" \"What\u0027s up now, I wonder?\" thought Jed. The lady turned upon him a severe look. \"Jedediah,\" she said, \"is it true that your earlier years were spent at the Scranton poorhouse?\" \"Yes, madam,\" answered Jed, coloring. \"Did you apprise my brother of this fact when he engaged you?\" \"No, madam. I suppose you learned it from Percy Dixon.\" \"I learned it from young Mr. Dixon, but I could hardly believe it. He referred me to Mr. Simeon Fogson, of Scranton, and I have[Pg 169] a letter from that gentleman in my hand. You probably will not care to read it.\" \"I should like very much to read it, Miss Holbrook. I should like to know whether Mr. Fogson tells the truth.\" \"Here is the letter, then.\" Jed read it with conflicting emotions. Respected Madam: I am glad to give you the informashun you ask about that young villen Jed Gilman, who ran away from the Poor House some weeks since after a violent assault on me, his offishul guardeen. Words cannot tell you how much trouble I have had with that boy. Likewise he has been very impident to Mrs. Fogson. The reeson is that he was too much indulged by my predicesors in offis Mr. and Mrs. Avery. I have tried to do my dooty by the boy, but as Squire Dixon, the Overseer will tell you my efforts has been in vane. I am not supprised that your brother was took in by Jed for he is the artfulest boy I ever seen. I hope for the sake of your young nefew\u0027s welfare you will discharge him at once and not allow him to corrup his youthful mind. Yours respectfully, Simeon Fogson. \"Well,\" said Miss Holbrook triumphantly,[Pg 170] \"that doesn\u0027t seem to commend you very highly.\" \"No,\" answered Jed, returning the letter to the envelope. \"It is such a letter as I should expect Mr. Fogson to write.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he is unfit for his place,\" answered Jed boldly. \"He half starves the poor people under his charge, treats them roughly, and is detested by all.\" \"He says you are impudent and troublesome.\" \"I did not allow him to impose upon me.\" \"He says you ran away.\" \"I had a right to leave, as I felt able to support myself. I was recommended to do so by Dr. Redmond, the best physician in Scranton, who is a friend of mine.\" \"I have listened to your side of the story,\" said Miss Holbrook coldly, \"and the terms in which you speak of Mr. Fogson convince me that his charges are correct. Of course you will not expect me to keep you in charge of my nephew.\" \"Will you wait till Mr. Holbrook returns?\"[Pg 171] pleaded Jed, who felt sad at the prospect of parting with Chester. \"No; I shall not feel justified in doing so. I will pay you up to date, and assume the charge of Chester myself.\" She drew a bill from her pocket and handed it to Jed, who took it mechanically and left the room with a sober face. He was dismissed from his position in disgrace, a disgrace which he felt was not deserved.
