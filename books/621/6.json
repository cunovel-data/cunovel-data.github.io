{"id":45227,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"About a Year and half after I had entertain\u0027d these Notions, and by long musing, had as it were resolved them all into nothing, for want of an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpriz\u0027d one Morning early, with seeing no less than five Canoes all on Shore together on my side the Island; and the People who belong\u0027d to them all landed, and out of my sight: The Number of them broke all my Measures, for seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of it, Or how to take my Measures, to attack Twenty or Thirty Men single handed; so I lay still in my Castle, perplex\u0027d and discomforted: However I put my self into all the same Postures for an Attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for Action, if any Thing had presented; having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any Noise; at length being very impatient, I set my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and clamber\u0027d up to the Top of the Hill, by my two Stages as usual; standing so however that my Head did not appear above the Hill, so that they could not perceive me by any Means; here I observ\u0027d by the help of my Perspective Glass, that they were no less than Thirty in Number, that they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dress\u0027d. How they had cook\u0027d it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were all Dancing in I know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their own Way, round the Fire. While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my Perspective, two miserable Wretches dragg\u0027d from the Boats, where it seems they were laid by, and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being knock\u0027d down, I suppose with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and two or three others were at work immediately cutting him open for their Cookery, while the other Victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch seeing himself a little at Liberty, Nature inspir\u0027d him with Hopes of Life, and he started away from them, and ran with incredible Swiftness along the Sands directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the Coast, where my Habitation was. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I perceived him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw him pursued by the whole Body, and now I expected that part of my Dream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my Grove; but I could not depend by any means upon my Dream for the rest Of it, (viz.) that the other Savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there. However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began to recover, when I found that there was not above three Men that follow\u0027d him, and still more was I encourag\u0027d, when I found that he outstrip\u0027d them exceedingly in running, and gain\u0027d Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an Hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I mention\u0027d often at the first part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly, he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken there: But when the Savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, tho\u0027 the Tide was then up, but plunging in, swam thro\u0027 in about Thirty Strokes or thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength and Swiftness; when the Three Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two of them could Swim, but the Third cou\u0027d not, and that standing on the other Side, he look\u0027d at the other, but went no further; and soon after went softly back again, which as it happen\u0027d, was very well for him in the main. \\n\\n \\n\\n I observ\u0027d, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as long swimming over the Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from them: It came now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and perhaps a Companion, or Assistant; and that I was call\u0027d plainly by Providence to save this poor Creature\u0027s Life; I immediately run down the Ladders with all possible Expedition, fetches my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot of the Ladders, as I observ\u0027d above; and getting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the Hill, I cross\u0027d toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill, clapp\u0027d my self in the way, between the Pursuers, and the Pursu\u0027d; hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon\u0027d with my Hand to him, to come back; and in the mean time, I slowly advanc\u0027d towards the two that follow\u0027d; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knock\u0027d him down with the Stock of my Piece I was loath to fire, because 1 would not have the rest hear; though at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out of Sight of the Smoke too, they wou\u0027d not have easily known what to make of it: Having knock\u0027d this Fellow down, the other who pursu\u0027d with him stopp\u0027d, as if he had been frighted; and I advanc\u0027d a-pace towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceiv\u0027d presently, he had a Bow and Arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and kill\u0027d him at the first Shoot; the poor Savage who fled, but had stopp\u0027d; though he saw both his Enemies fallen, and kill\u0027d, as he thought; yet was so frighted with the Fire, and Noise of my Piece, that he stood Stock still, and neither came forward or went backward, tho\u0027 he seem\u0027d rather enclin\u0027d to fly still, than to come on; I hollow\u0027d again to him, and made Signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then stopp\u0027d again, and then a little further, and stopp\u0027d again, and I cou\u0027d then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken Prisoner, and had just been to be kill\u0027d, as his two Enemies were; I beckon\u0027d him again to come to me, and gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token of acknowledgement for my saving his Life: I smil\u0027d at him, and look\u0027d pleasantly, and beckon\u0027d to him to come still nearer; at length he came close to me, and then he kneel\u0027d down again, kiss\u0027d the Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking me by the Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was in token of swearing to be my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much of him, and encourag\u0027d him all I could. But there was more work to do yet, for I perceived the Savage who I knock\u0027d down, was not kill\u0027d, but stunn\u0027d with the blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to him, and showing him the Savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some Words to me, and though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a Man\u0027s Voice, that I had heard, my own excepted, for above Twenty Five Years. But there was no time for such Reflections now, the Savage who was knock\u0027d down recover\u0027d himself so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I perceived that my Savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other Piece at the Man, as if I would shoot him, upon this my Savage, for so I call him now, made a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by my side; so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one blow cut off his Head as cleaverly, no Executioner in Germany, could have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for one who 1 had Reason to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except their own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learn\u0027d afterwards, they make their Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so hard, that they will cut off Heads even with them, ay and Arms, and that at one blow too; when he had done this, he comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword again, and with abundance of Gestures which I did not understand, laid it down with the Head of the Savage, that he had kill\u0027d just before me. \\n\\n \\n\\n But that which astonish\u0027d him most, was to know how I had kill\u0027d the other Indian so far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let him go to him, so I bad him go, as well as I could, when he came to him, he stood like one amaz\u0027d, looking at him, turn\u0027d him first on one side, then on t\u0027other, look\u0027d at the Wound the Bullet had made, which it seems was just in his Breast, where it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of Blood had follow\u0027d, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead; He took up his Bow, and Arrows, and came back, so I turn\u0027d to go away, and beckon\u0027d to him to follow me, making Signs to him, that more might come after them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon this he sign\u0027d to me, that he should bury them with Sand, that they might not be seen by the rest if they follow\u0027d; and so I made Signs again to him to do so; he fell to Work, and in an instant he had scrap\u0027d a Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragg\u0027d him into it, and cover\u0027d him, and did so also by the other; I believe he had bury\u0027d them both in a Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I carry\u0027d him not to my Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on the farther Part of the Island; so I did not let my Dream come to pass in that Part, viz. That he came into my Grove for shelter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he was indeed in great Distress for, by his Running; and having refresh\u0027d him, I made Signs for him to go lie down and sleep; pointing to a Place where I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket upon it, which 1 used to sleep upon my self some times; so the poor Creature laid down, and went to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made; with straight strong Limbs, not too large; tall and well shap\u0027d, and as I reckon, about twenty six Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance, not a fierce and surly Aspect; but seem\u0027d to have something very manly in his Face, and yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of an European in his Countenance too, especially when he smil\u0027d. His Hair was long and black, not curl\u0027d like Wool; his Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity and sparkling Sharpness in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians, and Virginians, and other Natives of America are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something very agreeable; tho\u0027 not very easy to describe. His Face was round, and plump; his Nose small, not flat like the Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his line Teeth well set, and white as Ivory. After he had slumber\u0027d, rather than slept, about half an Hour, he wak\u0027d again, and comes out of the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats, which I had in the Enclosure just by: When he espy\u0027d me, he came running to me, laying himself down again upon the Ground, with all the possible Signs of an humble thankful Disposition, making a many antick Gestures show it: At last he lays his Head flat upon the Ground, close to my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done before; and after this, made all the Signs to me of Subjection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let me know, how he would serve me as long as he liv\u0027d; I understood him in many Things, and let him know, I was very well pleas\u0027d with him; in a little Time I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first, I made him know his Name should be Friday, which was the Day I sav\u0027d his Life; I call\u0027d him so for the Memory of the Time; I likewise taught him to say Master, and then let him know, that was to be my Name; I likewise taught him to say, YES, and No, and to know the Meaning of them; I gave him some Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let him see me Drink it before him, and sop my Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do the like, which he quickly comply\u0027d with, and made Signs that it was very good for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I beckon\u0027d to him to come with me, and let him know, I would give him some Cloaths, at which he seem\u0027d very glad, for he was stark naked: As we went by the Place where he had bury\u0027d the two Men, he pointed exactly to the Place, and shew\u0027d me the Marks that he had made to find them again, making Signs to me, that we should dig them up again, and eat them; at this I appear\u0027d very angry, express\u0027d my Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the Thoughts of it, and beckon\u0027d with my Hand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great Sub mission. I then led him up to the Top of the Hill, to see if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my Glass, I look\u0027d, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but no appearance of them, or of their Canoes; so that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two Comrades behind them, without any search after them. \\n\\n \\n\\n But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more Courage, and consequently more Curiosity, I takes my Man Friday with me, giving him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and Arrows at his Back, which I found he could use very dextrously, making him carry one Gun for me, and I two for my self, and away we march\u0027d to the Place, where these Creatures had been; for I had a Mind now to get some fuller Intelligence of them: When I came to the Place, my very Blood ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart sunk within me, at the Horror of the Spectacle: indeed it was a dreadful Sight, at least it was so to me; though Friday made nothing of it: The Place was cover\u0027d with humane Bones, the Ground dy\u0027d with their Blood, great Pieces of Flesh left here and there, half eaten, mangl\u0027d and scorch\u0027d; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant Feast they had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies; I saw three Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other Parts of the Bodies; and Friday, by his Signs, made me under stand, that they brought over four Prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth: That there had been a great Battle between them, and their next King, whose Subjects it seems he had been one of; and that they had taken a great Number of Prisoners, all which were carry\u0027d to several Places by those that had taken them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by these Wretches upon those they brought hither. \\n\\n \\n\\n I caus\u0027d Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever remain\u0027d, and lay them together on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it, and burn them all to Ashes: I found Friday had still a hankering Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in his Nature; but I discover\u0027d so much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of it, and at the least Appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I had by some Means let him know, that I would kill him if he offer\u0027d it. \\n\\n \\n\\n When we had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there I fell to work for my Man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of Linnen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunners Chest I mention\u0027d, and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little Alteration fitted him very well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat\u0027s-skin, as well as my Skill would allow; and I was now grown a tollerable good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, which I had made of a Hare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was cloath\u0027d for the present, tollerably well; and was mighty well pleas\u0027d to see himself almost as well cloath\u0027d as his Master: It is true, he went awkardly in these Things at first; wearing the Drawers was very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Wastcoat gall\u0027d his Shoulders, and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he com plain\u0027d they hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he took to them very well. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began to consider where I should lodge him, and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy my self; I made a little Tent for him in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first; and as there was a Door, or Entrance there into my Cave, I made a formal fram\u0027d Door Case, and a Door to it of Boards, and set it up in the Passage, a little within the Entrance; and causing the Door to open on the inside, I barr\u0027d it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost Wall, without making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my first Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the side of the Hill, which was again laid cross with smaller Sticks instead of Laths, and then thatch\u0027d over a great Thickness, with the Rice Straw, which was strong like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had plac\u0027d a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been attempted on the outside, would not have open\u0027d at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great Noise; and as to Weapons, I took them all to my Side every Night. \\n\\n \\n\\n But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had a more faithful, loving, sincere Servant, than Friday was to me; without Passions, Sullenness or Designs, perfectly oblig\u0027d and engag\u0027d; his very Affections were ty\u0027d to me, like those of a Child to a Father; and I dare say, he would have sacrific\u0027d his Life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever; the many Testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinc\u0027d me, that I needed to use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his Account. \\n\\n \\n\\n This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that however it had pleas\u0027d God, in his Providence, and in the Government of the Works of his Hands, to take from so great a Part of the World of his Creatures, the best uses to which their Faculties, and the Powers of their Souls are adapted; yet that he has bestow\u0027d upon them the same Powers, the same Reason, the same Affections, the same Sentiments of Kindness and Obligation, the same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs, the same Sense of Gratitude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, and receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to offer to them Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the right Uses for which they were bestow\u0027d, than we are; and this made me very melancholly sometimes, in reflecting as the several Occasions presented, how mean a Use we make of all these, even though we have these Powers enlighten\u0027d by the great Lamp of Instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding; and why it has pleas\u0027d God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so many Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage, would make a much better use of it than we did. \\n\\n \\n\\n From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Soveraignty of Providence, and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut it up, and check\u0027d my Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st.) That we did not know by what Light and Law these should be Condemn\u0027d; but that as God was necessarily, and by the Nature of his Being, infinitely Holy and Just, so it could not be, but that if these Creatures were all sentenc\u0027d to Absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that Light which, as the Scripture says, was a Law to themselves, and by such Rules as their Consciences would acknowledge to be just, tho\u0027 the Foundation was not discover\u0027d to us: And (2d.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no Vessel could say to him, Why hast thou form\u0027d me thus? \\n\\n \\n\\n But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my Business to teach him every Thing, that was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and under stand me when I spake, and he was the aptest Schollar that ever was, and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased, when he cou\u0027d but understand me, or make me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my Life began to be so easy, that I began to say to my self, that could I but have been safe from more Savages, I cared not, if I was never to remove from the place while I lived. \\n\\n \\n\\n After I had been two or three Days return\u0027d to my Castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the Relish of a Cannibal\u0027s Stomach, I ought to let him taste other Flesh; so I took him out with me one Morning to the Woods: I went indeed intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring him home and dress it. But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two young Kids sitting by her; I catch\u0027d hold of Friday, hold says I, stand still; and made Signs to him not to stir, immediately I presented my Piece, shot and kill\u0027d one of the Kids. The poor Creature who had at a Distance indeed seen me kill the Savage his Enemy, but did not know, or could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surpriz\u0027d, trembled, and shook, and look\u0027d so amaz\u0027d, that I thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the Kid I shot at, or perceive I had kill\u0027d it, but ripp\u0027d up his Wastcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently thought I was resolv\u0027d to kill him; for he came and kneel\u0027d down to me, and embraceing my Knees, said a great many Things I did not understand; but I could easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him. \\n\\n \\n\\n I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm, and taking him up by the Hand laugh\u0027d at him, and pointed to the Kid which I had kill\u0027d, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and looking to see how the Creature was kill\u0027d, I loaded my Gun again, and by and by I saw a great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree within Shot; so to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I call\u0027d him to me again, pointed at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot, tho\u0027 I thought it had been a Hawk, I say pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that Bird; accordingly I fir\u0027d and bad him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall, he stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the more amaz\u0027d, because he did not see me put any Thing into the Gun; but thought that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death and Destruction in that Thing, able to kill Man, Beast, Bird, or any Thing near, or far off; and the Astonishment this created in him was such, as could not wear off for a long Time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipp\u0027d me and my Gun: As for the Gun it self, he would not so much as touch it for several Days after; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answer\u0027d him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learn\u0027d of him, was to desire it not to kill him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stay\u0027d some Time; for the Parrot not being quite dead, was flutter\u0027d away a good way off from the Place where she fell; however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceivd his Ignorance about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to charge the Gun again, and not let him see me do it, that 1 might be ready for any other Mark that might present; but nothing more offer\u0027d at that Time; so I brought home the Kid, and the same Evening I took the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I could; and having a Pot for that purpose, I boil\u0027d, or stew\u0027d some of the Flesh, and made some very good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my Man, who seem\u0027d very glad of it, and lik\u0027d it very well; but that which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made a Sign to me, that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his own Mouth, he seem\u0027d to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water after it; on the other hand, I took some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at the Salt; but it would not do, he would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his Broth; at least not a great while, and then but a very little. \\n\\n \\n\\n Having thus fed him with boil\u0027d Meat and Broth, I was resolv\u0027d to feast him the next Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this 1 did by hanging it before the Fire, in a String, as I had seen many People do in England, setting two Poles up, one on each side the Fire, and one cross on the Top, and tying the String to the Cross-stick, letting the Meat turn continually: This Friday admir\u0027d very much; but when he came to taste the Flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he lik\u0027d it, that I could not but understand him; and at last he told me he would never eat Man\u0027s Flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next Day I set him to work to beating some Corn out, and sifting it in the manner I us\u0027d to do, as I observ\u0027d before and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to make Bread of; for after that I let him see me make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a little Time Friday was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I could do it my self. \\n\\n \\n\\n I begun now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead of one, I must provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a larger Quantity of Corn, than I us\u0027d to do; so I mark\u0027d out a larger Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the same Manner as before, in which Friday not only work\u0027d very willingly, and very hard; but did it very chearfully, and I told him what it was for; that it was for Corn to make more Bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him, and my self too: He appear\u0027d very sensible of that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had much more Labour upon me on his Account, than I had for my self; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place; Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost every Thing I had occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to send him to, and talk\u0027d a great deal to me; so that in short I began now to have some Use for my Tongue again, which indeed I had very little occasion for before; that is to say, about Speech; besides the Pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the Fellow himself; his simple unfeign\u0027d Honesty, appear\u0027d to me more and more every Day, and I began really to love the Creature; and on his Side, I believe he lov\u0027d me more than it was possible for him ever to love any Thing before. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering Inclination to his own Country again, and having learn\u0027d him English so well that he could answer me almost any Questions, I ask\u0027d him whether the Nation that he belong\u0027d to never conquer\u0027d in Battle, at which he smil\u0027d; and said; yes, yes, we always fight the better; that is, he meant always get the better in Fight; and so we began the following Discourse: You always fight the better said I, How came you to be taken Prisoner then, Friday? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, My Nation beat much, for all that. \\n\\n \\n\\n Master, How beat; if your Nation beat them, how come you to be taken? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, They more many than my Nation in the Place where me was; they take one, two, three, and me; my Nation over beat them in the yonder Place, where me no was; there my Nation take one, two, great Thousand. \\n\\n \\n\\n Master, But why did not your Side recover you from the Hands of your Enemies then? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the Canoe; my Nation have no Canoe that time. \\n\\n \\n\\n Master, Well, Friday, and What does your Nation do with the Men they take, do they carry them away, and eat them, as these did? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all up. \\n\\n \\n\\n Master, Where do they carry them? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, Go to other Place where they think. \\n\\n \\n\\n Master, Do they come hither? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else Place. \\n\\n \\n\\n Master, Have you been here with them? \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday, Yes, I been here; [points to the N.W. Side of the Island, which it seems was their Side.] \\n\\n \\n\\n By this I understood, that my Man Friday had formerly been among the Savages, who us\u0027d to come on Shore on the farther Part of the Island, on the same Man eating Occasions that he was now brought for; and sometime after, when I took the Courage to carry him to that Side, being the same I formerly mention\u0027d, he presently knew the Place, and told me, he was there once when they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and one Child; he could not tell Twenty in English; but he numbred them by laying so many Stones on a Row, and pointing to me to tell them over. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that after I had had this Discourse with him, I ask\u0027d him how far it was from our Island to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were not often lost; he told me, there was no Danger, no Canoes ever lost; but that after a little way out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind, always one way in the Morning, the other in the Afternoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n This I understood to be no more than the Sets of the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was occasion\u0027d by the great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroonooko; in the Mouth, or the Gulph of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island lay; and this Land which I perceiv\u0027d to the W. and N. W. was the great Island Trinidad, on the North Point of the Mouth of the River: I ask\u0027d Friday a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the Sea, the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me all he knew with the greatest Openness imaginable; I ask\u0027d him the Names of the several Nations of his Sort of People; but could get no other Name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood, that these were the Caribbees, which our Maps place on the Part of America, which reaches from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha: He told me that up a great way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond the Setting of the Moon, which must be W. from their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men, like me; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention\u0027d before; and that they had kill\u0027d much Mans, that was his Word; by all which I under stood he meant the Spaniards, whose Cruelties in America had been spread over the whole Countries, and was remember\u0027d by all the Nations from Father to Son. \\n\\n \\n\\n I enquir\u0027d if he could tell me how I might come from this Island, and get among those white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go in two Canoe; I could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by two Canoe, till at last with great Difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large great Boat, as big as two Canoes. \\n\\n \\n\\n This Part of Friday\u0027s Discourse began to relish with me very well, and from this Time I entertain\u0027d some Hopes, that one Time or other, I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this Place; and that this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to do It. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the long Time that Friday has now been with me, and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly I ask\u0027d him one Time who made him? The poor Creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had ask\u0027d who was his Father; but I took it by another handle, and ask\u0027d him who made the Sea, the Ground we walk\u0027d on, and the Hills, and Woods; he told me it was one old Benamuckee, that liv\u0027d beyond all: He could describe nothing of this great Person, but that he was very old; much older he said than the Sea, or the Land; than the Moon, or the Stars: I ask\u0027d him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why did not all Things worship him; he look\u0027d very grave, and with a perfect Look of Innocence, said, All Things do say O to him: I ask\u0027d him if the People who die in his Country went away any where; he said, yes, they all went to Benamuckee; then I ask\u0027d him whether these they eat up went thither too, he said yes. \\n\\n \\n\\n From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Know ledge of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of all Things liv\u0027d up there, pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs the World by the same Power and Providence by which he had made it: That he was omnipotent, could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to us, take every Thing from us; and thus by Degrees I open\u0027d his Eyes. He listned with great Attention, and receiv\u0027d with Pleasure the Notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even into Heaven; he told me one Day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the Sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who liv\u0027d but a little way off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him; I ask\u0027d him if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they never went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who he call\u0027d their Oowocakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me, their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say O, (so he called saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee said: By this I observ\u0027d, That there is Priestcraft, even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of making a secret Religion, in order to preserve the Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and barbarous Savages. \\n\\n \\n\\n I endeavour\u0027d to clear up this Fraud, to my Man Friday, and told him, that the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains, to say O to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their bringing Word from thence what he said, was much more so; that if they met with any Answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an evil Spirit: And then I entred into a long Discourse with him about the Devil, the Original of him, his Rebellion against God, his Enmity to Man, the Reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark Parts of the World to be Worship\u0027d instead of God, and as God; and the many Stratagems he made use of to delude Mankind to his Ruine; how he had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections, to adapt his Snares so to our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own Tempters, and to run upon our Destruction by our own Choice. \\n\\n \\n\\n I found it was not so easie to imprint right Notions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted all my Arguments to Evidence to him, even the Necessity Of a great first Cause and over-ruling governing Power; a secret directing Providence, and of the Equity, and Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us, and the like. But there appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit; of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor Creature puzzl\u0027d me once in such a manner, by a Question meerly natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful Nature to Sin, his being a consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen\u0027d with great Seriousness to me all the while. \\n\\n \\n\\n After this, I had been telling him how the Devil was God\u0027s Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good Designs of Providence, and to ruine the Kingdom of Christ in the World; and the like. Well, says Friday, but you say, God is so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much might as the Devil? Yes, yes, says I, Friday, God is stronger than the Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our Feet, and enable us to resist his Temptations and quench his fiery Darts. But, says he again, if God much strong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil, so make him no more do wicked? \\n\\n \\n\\n I was strangely surpriz\u0027d at his Question, and after all, tho\u0027 I was now an old Man, yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough quallified for a Casuist, or a Solver of Difficulties And at first I could not tell what to say, so I pre tended not to hear him, and ask\u0027d him what he said? But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget his Question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken Words, as above. By this time I had recovered my self a little, and I said, God will at last punish him severely; he is reserv\u0027d for the Judgment, and is to be cast into the Bottomless-Pit, to dwell with ever lasting Fire. This did not satisfie Friday, but he returns upon me, repeating my Words, RESERVE, AT LAST, me no understand; but, Why not kill the Devil now, not kill great ago? You may as well ask me, said I, Why God does not kill you and I, when we do wicked Things here that offend him? We are preserv\u0027d to repent and be pardon\u0027d: He muses a while at this; mell, All, says he, mighty affectionately, that well; so you, I, Devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was run down again by him to the last Degree, and it was a Testimony to me, how the meer Notions of Nature, though they will guide reasonable Creatures to the Know ledge of a God, and of a Worship or Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as the Consequence of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a Redemption purchas\u0027d for us, of a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-stool of God\u0027s Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven, can form these in the Soul, and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; I mean, the Word of God, and the Spirit of God promis\u0027d for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People, are the absolutely necessary Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the saving Knowledge of God, and the Means of Salvation. \\n\\n \\n\\n I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my Man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out; then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously pray\u0027d to God that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor Savage, assisting by his Spirit the Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the Light of the Knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to speak so to him from the Word of God, as his Conscience might be convinc\u0027d, hid Eyes open\u0027d, and his Soul sav\u0027d. When he came again to me, I entred into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach\u0027d from Heaven, viz. of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Blessed Lord Jesus. I then explain\u0027d to him, as well as I could, why our Blessed Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of Abraham, and how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemption; that he came only to the lost Sheep of the House of Israel, and the like. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Knowledge, in all the Methods I took for this poor Creature\u0027s Instruction, and must acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same Principle will find, That in laying Things open to him, I really inform\u0027d and instructed my self in many Things, that either I did not know, or had not fully consider\u0027d before; but which occurr\u0027d naturally to my Mind, upon my searching into them, for the Information of this poor Savage; and I had more Affection in my Enquiry after Things upon this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor wild Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be thankful that ever he came to me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my Habitation grew comfortable to me beyond Measure; and when I reflected that in this solitary Life which I had been confin\u0027d to, I had not only been moved my self to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand that had brought me there; but was now to be made an Instrument under Providence to save the Life, and for ought I knew, the Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of Religion, and of the Christian Doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom is Life eternal. I say, when I reflected upon all these Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and I frequently rejoyc\u0027d that ever I was brought to this Place, which I had so often thought the most dreadful of all Afflictions that could possibly have befallen me. \\n\\n \\n\\n In this thankful Frame I continu\u0027d all the Remainder of my Time, and the Conversation which employ\u0027d the Hours between Friday and I, was such, as made the three Years which we liv\u0027d there together perfectly and compleatly happy, if any such Thing as compleat Happiness can be form\u0027d in a sublunary State. The Savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor\u0027d Penitents; we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been in England. \\n\\n \\n\\n I always apply\u0027d my self in Reading the Scripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious Enquiries, and Questionings, made me, as I said before, a much better Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have been by my own private meer Reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here also from Experience, in this retir\u0027d Part of my Life,viz. How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing it is, that the Knowledge of God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God; so easy to be receiv\u0027d and understood: That as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my Duty, to carry me directly on to the great Work of sincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a stated Reformation in Practice, and Obedience to all God\u0027s Commands, and this without any Teacher or Instructer; I mean, humane; so the same plain Instruction sufficiently serv\u0027d to the enlightning this Savage Creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal to him in my Life. \\n\\n \\n\\n As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife and Contention, which has happen\u0027d in the World about Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or Schemes of Church Government, they were all perfectly useless to us; as for ought I can yet see, they have been to all the rest of the World: We had the sure Guide to Heaven, viz. The Word of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable Views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing us by his Word, leading us into all Truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the Instruction of his Word; and I cannot see the least Use that the greatest Knowledge of the disputed Points in Religion which have made such Confusions in the World would have been to us, if we could have obtain\u0027d it; but I must go on with the Historical Part of Things, and take every Part in its order. \\n\\n \\n\\n After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken English to me; I acquainted him with my own Story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into the Place, how I had liv\u0027d there, and how long. I let him into the Mystery, for such it was to him, of Gunpowder, and Bullet, and taught him how to shoot: I gave him a Knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear Hangers in; and in the Frog, instead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which was not only as good a Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions. \\n\\n \\n\\n I describ\u0027d to him the Country of Europe, and particularly England, which I came from; how we liv\u0027d, how we worshipp\u0027d God, how we behav\u0027d to one another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of the World: I gave him an Account of the Wreck which I had been on board of, and shew\u0027d him as near as I could, the Place where she lay; but she was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n I shew\u0027d him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap\u0027d, and which I could not stir with my whole Strength then; but was now fallen almost all to Pieces: Upon seeing this Boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I ask\u0027d him what it was he study\u0027d upon, at last says he, me see such Boat like come to Place at my Nation. \\n\\n \\n\\n I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examin\u0027d farther into it, I understood by him, that a Boat, such as that had been, came on Shore upon the Country where he liv\u0027d; that is, as he explain\u0027d it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I presently imagin\u0027d, that some European Ship must have been cast away upon their Coast, and the Boat might get loose, and drive a Shore; but was so dull, that I never once thought of Men making escape from a Wreck thither, much less whence they might come; so I only enquir\u0027d after a Description of the Boat. \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday describ\u0027d the Boat to me well enough; but brought me better to understand him, when he added with some Warmth, we save the white Mans from drown: Then I presently ask\u0027d him, if there was any white Mans, as he call\u0027d them, in the Boat; yes, he said, the Boat full white Mans: I ask\u0027d him how many; he told upon his Fingers seventeen: I ask\u0027d him then what become of them; he told me, they live, they dwell at my Nation. \\n\\n \\n\\n This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin\u0027d, that these might be the Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away in Sight of my Island, as I now call it; and who after the Ship was struck on the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had sav\u0027d themselves in their Boat, and were landed upon that wild Shore among the Savages. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon this, I enquir\u0027d of him more critically, What was become of them? He assur\u0027d me they lived still there; that they had been there about four Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them Victuals to live. I ask\u0027d him, How it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them? He said No, they make Brother with them; that is, as I understood him, a Truce: And then he added, They no eat Mans but when make the War fight; that is to say, they never eat any Men but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in Battle. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of the Hill, at the East Side of the Island, from whence as have said, I had in a clear Day discover\u0027d the Main, or Continent of America; Friday, the Weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the Main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some Distance from him: I ask\u0027d him, What was the Matter? O joy! Says he, O glad! There see my Country, there my Nation! \\n\\n \\n\\n I observ\u0027d an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear\u0027d in his Face, and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover\u0027d a strange Eagerness, as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and this Observation of mine, put a great many Thoughts into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new Man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his own Nation again, he would not only forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to me; and would be forward enough to give his Countrymen an Account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he us\u0027d to be with those of his Enemies, when they were taken in War. \\n\\n \\n\\n But I wrong\u0027d the poor honest Creature very much, for which I was very sorry afterwards. However as my Jealousy encreased, and held me some Weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the honest grateful Creature having no thought about it, but what consisted with the best Principles, both as a religious Christian, and as a grateful Friend, as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every Day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new Thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but I found every thing he said was so Honest, and so Innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion; and in spight of all my Uneasiness he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in the least perceive that I was Uneasie, and therefore I could not suspect him of Deceit. \\n\\n \\n\\n One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being haizy at Sea, so that we could not see the Continent, I call\u0027d to him, and said, Friday, do not you wish your self in your own Country, your own Nation? Yes, he said, he be much O glad to be at his own Nation. What would you do there said I, would you turn Wild again, eat Mens Flesh again, and be a Savage as you were before? He lookt full of Concern, and shaking his Head said, No no, Friday tell them to live Good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat Corn bread, Cattleflesh, Milk, no eat Man again: Why then said I to him, They will kill you. He look\u0027d grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me, they willing love learn: He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added, they learn\u0027d much of the Bearded-Mans that come in the Boat. Then I ask\u0027d him if he would go back to them? He smil\u0027d at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told him I would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he would go, if I would go with him. I go! says I, why they will Eat me if I come there! No, no, says he, me make they no Eat you; me make they much Love you: He meant he would tell them how I had kill\u0027d his Enemies, and sav\u0027d his Life, and so he would make them love me; then he told me as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White-men, or Bearded-men, as he call\u0027d them, who came on Shore there in Distress. \\n\\n \\n\\n From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see if I could possibly joyn with these Bearded-men, who I made no doubt were Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I could we might find some Method to Escape from thence, being upon the Continent, and a good Company together, better than I could from an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without Help. So after some Days I took Friday to work again, by way of Discourse, and told him I would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; and accordingly I carry\u0027d him to my Frigate which lay on the other Side of the Island, and having clear\u0027d it of Water, for I always kept it sunk in the Water, I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went into it. \\n\\n \\n\\n I found he was a most dextrous Fellow at managing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I said to him, Well now, Friday, shall we go to your Nation? He look\u0027d very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he thought the Boat too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next Day I went to the Place where the first Boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get into Water: He said that was big enough; but then as I had taken no Care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun had split and dry\u0027d it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a Boat would do very well, and would carry much enough Vittle, Drink, Bread, that was his Way of Talking. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon the whole, I was by this Time so fix\u0027d upon my Design of going over with him to the Continent, that I told him we would go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answer\u0027d not one Word, but look\u0027d very grave and sad: I ask\u0027d him what was the matter with him? He ask\u0027d me again thus; Why, you angry mad with Friday, what me done? I ask\u0027d him what he meant; I told him I was not angry with him at all. No angry! No angry! says he, repeating the Words several Times, Why send Friday home away to my Nation? Why, (says I) Friday, did you not say you wish\u0027d you were there? Yes, yes, says he, wish be both there, no wish Friday there, no Master there. In a Word, he would not think of going there without me; I go there! Friday, (says I) what shall I do there? He turn\u0027d very quick upon me at this: You do great deal much good, says he, you teach wild Mans be good sober tame Mans; you tell them know God, pray and live new Life. Alas! Friday, (says I) thou knowest not what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant Man my self Yes, yes, says he, you teachee me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday, (says I) you shall go without me, leave me here to live by my self as I did before. He look\u0027d confus\u0027d again at that Word, and running to one of the Hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, comes and gives it me, What must I do with this? says I to him. You take, kill Friday; (says he.) What must I kill you for? said I again. He returns very quick, What you send Friday away for? take, kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes: In a Word, I so plainly discover\u0027d the utmost Affection in him to me, and a firm Resolution in him, that I told him then, and often after, that I would never send him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon the whole, as I found by all his Discourse a settled Affection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the Foundation of his Desire to go to his own Country, was laid in his ardent Affection to the People, and his Hopes of my doing them good; a Thing which as I had no Notion of my self, so I had not the least Thought or Intention, or Desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong Inclination to my attempting an Escape as above, founded on the Supposition gather\u0027d from the Discourse, (viz.) That there were seventeen bearded Men there; and therefore, without any more Delay, I went to Work with Friday to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage. There were Trees enough in the Island to have built a little Fleet, not of Periagua\u0027s and Canoes, but even of good large Vessels. But the main Thing I look\u0027d at, was to get one so near the Water that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the Mistake I committed at first. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last, Friday pitch\u0027d upon a Tree, for I found he knew much better than I what kind of Wood was fittest for it, nor can I tell to this Day what Wood to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was very like the Tree we call Fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the same Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for a Boat. But I shew\u0027d him how rather to cut it out with Tools, which, after I had shew\u0027d him how to use, he did very handily, and in about a Month\u0027s hard Labour, we finished it, and made it very handsome, especially when with our Axes, which I shew\u0027d him how to handle, we cut and hew\u0027d the out-side into the true Shape of a Boat; after this, however, it cost us near a Fortnight\u0027s Time to get her along as it were Inch by Inch upon great Rowlers into the Water. But when she was in, she would have carry\u0027d twenty Men with great Ease. \\n\\n \\n\\n When she was in the Water, and tho\u0027 she was so big it amazed me to see with what Dexterity and how swift my Man Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I ask\u0027d him if he would, and if we might venture over in her; Yes, he said, he venture over in her very well, tho\u0027 great blow Wind. However, I had a farther Design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mast and Sail and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As to a Mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitch\u0027d upon a strait young Cedar-Tree, which I found near the Place, and which there was great Plenty of in the Island, and I set Friday to Work to cut it down, and gave him Directions how to shape and order it. But as to the Sail, that was my particular Care; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of old Sails enough; but as I had had them now six and twenty Years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of Use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten, and indeed most of them were so; however, I found two Pieces which appear\u0027d pretty good, and with these I went to Work, and with a great deal of Pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for Want of Needles, I at length made a three Corner\u0027d ugly Thing, like what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, to go with a Boom at bottom, and a little short Sprit at the Top, such as usually our Ships Long Boats sail with, and such as I best knew how to manage; because it was such a one as I had to the Boat, in which I made my Escape from Barbary, as related in the first Part of my Story. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was near two Months performing this last Work, viz. rigging and fitting my Mast and Sails; for I finish\u0027d them very compleat, making a small Stay, and a Sail, or Foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to Windward; and which was more than all, I fix\u0027d a Rudder to the Stern of her, to steer with; and though I was but a bungling Shipwright, yet as I knew the Usefulness, and even Necessity of such a Thing, I apply\u0027d my self with so much Pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though considering the many dull Contrivances I had for it that sail\u0027d, I think it cost me almost as much Labour as making the Boat. \\n\\n \\n\\n After all this was done too, I had my Man Friday to teach as to what belong\u0027d to the Navigation of my Boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belong\u0027d to a Sail, and a Rudder; and was the most amaz\u0027d, when he saw me work the Boat too and again in the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb\u0027d, and fill\u0027d this way, or that way, as the Course we sail\u0027d chang\u0027d; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one, astonish\u0027d and amaz\u0027d: However, with a little Use, I made all these Things familiar to him; and he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the Compass, I could make him understand very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy Weather, and seldom or never any Fogs in those Parts, there was the less occasion for a Compass, seeing the Stars were always to be seen by Night, and the Shore by Day, except in the rainy Seasons, and then no body car\u0027d to stir abroad, either by Land or Sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was now entred on the seven and twentieth Year of my Captivity in this Place; though the three last Years that I had this Creature with me, ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the Time. I kept the Anniversary of my Landing here with the same Thankfulness to God for his Mercies, as at first; and if I had such Cause of Acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, having such additional Testimonies of the Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes I had of being effectually, and speedily deliver\u0027d; for I had an invincible Impression upon my Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another Year in this Place: However, I went on with my Husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as usual; I gather\u0027d and cur\u0027d my Grapes, and did every necessary Thing as before. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rainy Season was in the mean Time upon me, when I kept more within Doors than at other Times; so I had stow\u0027d our new Vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where as I said, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at high Water mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little Dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her Water enough to fleet in; and then when the Tide was out, we made a strong Dam cross the End of it, to keep the Water out; and so she lay dry, as to the Tide from the Sea; and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many Boughs of Trees, so thick, that she was as well thatch\u0027d as a House; and thus we waited for the Month of November and December, in which I design\u0027d to make my Adventure. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the settled Season began to come in, as the thought of my Design return\u0027d with the fair Weather, I was pre paring daily for the Voyage; and the first Thing I did, was to lay by a certain Quantity of Provisions, being the Stores for our Voyage; and intended in a Week or a Fortnight\u0027s Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boat. I was busy one Morning upon some Thing of this kind, when I call\u0027d to Friday, and bid him go to the Sea Shore, and see if he could find a Turtle, or Tortoise, a Thing which we generally got once a Week, for the Sake of the Eggs, as well as the Flesh: Friday had not been long gone, when he came running back, and flew over my outer Wall, or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the Steps he set his Feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, O Master! O Master! O Sorrow! O bad! What\u0027s the Matter, Friday? says I; O yonder, there, says he, one, two, three Canoe! one, two, three! By his way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but on enquiry, I found it was but three: Well, Friday, says I, do not be frighted; so I heartned him up as well as I could: However, I saw the poor Fellow was most terribly scar\u0027d; for nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat him; and the poor Fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him: I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him; but, says I, Friday, we must resolve to fight them; Can you fight, Friday? Me shoot, says he, but there come many great Number. No matter for that, said I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not kill; so I ask\u0027d him, Whether if I resolv\u0027d to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him? He said, Me die, when you bid die, Master; so I went and fetch\u0027d a good Dram of Rum, and gave him; for I had been so good a Husband of my Rum, that had a great deal left: When he had drank it, I made him take the two Fowling-Pieces, which we always carry\u0027d, and load them with large Swan-Shot, as big as small Pistol Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded them with two Slugs, and five small Bullets each; and my two Pistols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets each; I hung my great Sword as usual, naked by my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I had thus prepar\u0027d my self, I took my Perspective-Glass, and went up to the Side of the Hill, to see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by my Glass, that there were one and twenty Savages, three Prisoners, and three Canoes; and that their whole Business seem\u0027d to be the triumphant Banquet upon these three humane Bodies, (a barbarous Feast indeed) but nothing more than as I had observ\u0027d was usual with them. \\n\\n \\n\\n I observ\u0027d also, that they were landed not where they had done, when Friday made his Escape; but nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and where a thick Wood came close almost down to the Sea: This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane Errand these Wretches came about, fill\u0027d me with such Indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and told him, I was resolv\u0027d to go down to them, and kill them all; and ask\u0027d him, If he would stand by me? He was now gotten over his Fright, and his Spirits being a little rais\u0027d, with the Dram I had given him, he was Cry chearful, and told me, as before, he would die, when I bid die. \\n\\n \\n\\n In this Fit of Fury, I took first and divided the Arms which I had charg\u0027d, as before, between us; I gave Friday one Pistol to stick in his Girdle, and three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took one Pistol, and the other three my self; and in this Posture we march\u0027d out: I took a small Bottle of Rum in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag, with more Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders, I charg\u0027d him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any Thing, till I bid him; and in the mean Time, not to speak a Word: In this Posture I fetch\u0027d a Compass to my Right-Hand, of near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to get into the Wood; so that I might come within shoot of them, before I should be discover\u0027d, which I had seen by my Glass, it was easy to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n While I was making this March, my former Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Resolution; I do not mean, that I entertain\u0027d any Fear of their Number; for as they were naked, unarm\u0027d Wretches, \u0027tis certain I was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone; but it occurr\u0027d to my Thoughts, What Call? What Occasion? much less, What Necessity I was in to go and dip my Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither done, or intended me any Wrong? Who as to me were innocent, and whose barbarous Customs were their own Disaster, being in them a Token indeed of God\u0027s having left them, with the other Nations of that Part of the World, to such Stupidity, and to such inhumane Courses; but did not call me to take upon me to be a Judge of their Actions, much less an Executioner of his Justice; that whenever he thought fit, he would take the Cause into his own Hands, and by national Vengeance punish them as a People, for national Crimes; but that in the mean time, it was none of my Business; that it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declar\u0027d Enemy, and in a State of War with those very particular People; and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could not say she same with respect to me: These Things were so warmly press\u0027d upon my Thoughts, all the way as I went, that I resolv\u0027d I would only go and place my self near them, that I might observe their barbarous Feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless something offer\u0027d that was more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them. \\n\\n \\n\\n With this Resolution I enter\u0027d the Wood, and with all possible Waryness and Silence, Friday following close at my Heels, I march\u0027d till I came to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was next to them; only that one Corner of the Wood lay between me and them; here I call\u0027d softly to Friday, and shewing him a great Tree, which was just at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to the Tree, and bring me Word if he could see there plainly what they were doing; he did so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly view\u0027d there; that they were all about their Fire, eating the Flesh of one of their Prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the Sand, a little from them, which be said they would kill next, and which fir\u0027d all the very Soul within me; he told me it was not one of their Nation; but one of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that came to their Country in the Boat: I was fill\u0027d with Horror at the very naming the white-bearded Man, and going to the Tree, I saw plainly by my Glass, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty\u0027d, with Flags, or Things like Rushes; and that he was an European, and had Cloaths on. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was another Tree, and a little Thicket beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to them than the Place where I was, which by going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscover\u0027d, and that then I should be within half Shot of them; so I with-held my Passion, though I was indeed enrag\u0027d to the highest Degree, and going back about twenty Paces, I got behind some Bushes, which held all the way, till I came to the other Tree; and then I came to a little rising Ground, which gave me a full View of them, at the Distance of about eighty Yards. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had now not a Moment to loose; for nineteen of the dreadful Wretches sat upon the Ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire, and they were stoop\u0027d down to untie the Bands, at his Feet; I turn\u0027d to Friday, now Friday, said I, do as I bid thee; Friday said he would; then Friday, says I, do exactly as you see me do, \u0027fail in nothing; so I set down one of the Muskets, and the Fowling-Piece, upon the Ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other Musket, I took my aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him, If he was ready? He said, yes, then fire at them, said I; and the same Moment I fir\u0027d also. \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday took his Aim so much better than I, that on the Side that he shot, he kill\u0027d two of them, and wounded three more; and on my Side, I kill\u0027d one, and wounded two: They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful Consternation; and all of them, who were not hurt, jump\u0027d up upon their Feet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to look; for they knew not from whence their Destruction came: Friday kept his Eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so as soon as the first Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took up the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like; he see me cock, and present, he did the same again; Are you ready, Friday? said I; yes, says he; let fly then, says I, in the Name of God, and with that I fir\u0027d again among the amaz\u0027d Wretches, and so did Friday; and as our Pieces were now loaden with what I call\u0027d Swan-Shot, or small Pistol Bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded, that they run about yelling, and skreaming, like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miserably wounded, most of them; whereof three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now Friday, says I, laying down the discharg\u0027d Pieces, and taking up the Musket, which was yet loaden; follow me, says I, which he did, with a great deal of Courage; upon which I rush\u0027d out of the Wood, and shew\u0027d my self, and Friday close at my Foot; as soon as I perceiv\u0027d they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday do so too; and running as fast as I could, which by the way, was not very fast, being loaden with Arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor Victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, between the Place where they sat, and the Sea; the two Butchers who were just going to work with him, had left him, at the Suprize of our first Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright, to the Sea Side, and had jump\u0027d into a Canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way; I turn\u0027d to Friday, and bid him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running about forty Yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had kill\u0027d them all; for I see them all fall of a Heap into the Boat; though I saw two of them up again quickly: However, he kill\u0027d two of them, and wounded the third; so that he lay down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n While my Man Friday fir\u0027d at them, I pull\u0027d out my Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor Victim, and loosing his Hands, and Feet, I lifted him up, and ask\u0027d him in the Portuguese Tongue, What he was? He answer\u0027d in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak, and faint, that he could scarce stand, or speak; I took my Bottle out of my Pocket, and gave it him, making Signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of Bread, which he eat; then I ask\u0027d him, What Countryman he was? And he said, Espagniole; and being a little recover\u0027d, let me know by all the Signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my Debt for his Deliverance; Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, we will talk afterwards; but we must fight now; if you have any Strength left, take this Pistol, and Sword, and lay about you; he took them very thankfully, and no sooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew upon his Murtherers, like a Fury, and had cut two of them in Pieces, in an instant; for the Truth is, as the whole was a Surprize to them; so the poor Creatures were so much frighted with the Noise of our Pieces, that they fell down for meer Amazement, and Fear; and had no more Power to attempt their own Escape, than their Flesh had to resist our Shot; and that was the Case of those Five that Friday shot at in the Boat; for as three of them fell with the Hurt they receiv\u0027d, so the other two fell with the Fright. \\n\\n \\n\\n I kept my Piece in my Hand still, without firing, being willing to keep my Charge ready; because I had given the Spaniard my Pistol, and Sword; so I call\u0027d to Friday, and bad him run up to the Tree, from whence we first fir\u0027d, and fetch the Arms which lay there, that had been discharg\u0027d, which he did with great Swiftness; and then giving him my Musket, I sat down my self to load all the rest again, and bad them come to me when they wanted: While I was loading these Pieces, there happen\u0027d a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard, and one of the Savages, who made at him with one of their great wooden Swords, the same Weapon that was to have kill\u0027d him before, if I had not prevented it: The Spaniard, who was as bold, and as brave as could be imagin\u0027d, though weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him two great Wounds on his Head; but the Savage being a stout lusty Fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing my Sword out of his Hand, when the Spaniard, tho\u0027 undermost wisely quitting the Sword, drew the Pistol from his Girdle, shot the Savage through the Body, and kill\u0027d him upon the Spot; before I, who was running to help him, could come near him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Friday being now left to his Liberty, pursu\u0027d the flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand, but his Hatchet; and with that he dispatch\u0027d those three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with, and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he pursu\u0027d two of the Savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run, they both got from him into the Wood, where Friday pursu\u0027d them, and kill\u0027d one of them; but the other was too nimble for him, and though he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the Sea, and swam with all his might off to those two who were left in the Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one wounded, who we know not whether he dy\u0027d or no, were all that escap\u0027d our Hands of one and twenty: The Account of the Rest is as follows; \\n\\n \\n\\n 3 Kill\u0027d at our first Shot from the Tree. \\n\\n 2 Kill\u0027d at the next Shot. \\n\\n 2 Kill\u0027d by Friday in the Boat. \\n\\n 2 Kill\u0027d by Ditto, of those at first wounded. \\n\\n 1 Kill\u0027d by Ditto, in the Wood. \\n\\n 3 Kill\u0027d by the Spaniard. \\n\\n 4 Kill\u0027d, being found dropp\u0027d here and there of their Wounds, or \\n\\n kill\u0027d by Friday in his Chase of them. \\n\\n 4 Escap\u0027d in the Boat, whereof one wounded if not dead. \\n\\n 21 In all. \\n\\n \\n\\n Those that were in the Canoe, work\u0027d hard to get out of Gun-Shot; and though Friday made two or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit any of them: Friday would fain have had me took one of their Canoes, and pursu\u0027d them; and indeed I was very anxious about their Escape, least carrying the News home to their People, they should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their Canoes, and devour us by meer Multitude; so I consented to pursue them by Sea, and running to one of their Canoes, I jump\u0027d in, and bad Friday follow me; but when 1 was in the Canoe, I was surpriz\u0027d to find another poor Creature lye there alive, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was, for the Slaughter, and almost dead with Fear, not knowing what the Matter was; for he had not been able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he was ty\u0027d so hard, Neck and Heels, and had been ty\u0027d so long, that he had really but little Life in him. \\n\\n I immediately cut the twisted Flags, or Rushes, which they had bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak, but groan\u0027d most piteously, believing it seems still that he was only unbound in order to be kill\u0027d. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Friday came to him, I bad him speak to him, and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a Dram, which, with the News of his being deliver\u0027d, reviv\u0027d him, and he sat up in the Boat; but when Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his Face, it would have mov\u0027d any one to Tears, to have seen how Friday kiss\u0027d him, embrac\u0027d him, hugg\u0027d him, cry\u0027d, laugh\u0027d, hollow\u0027d, jump\u0027d about, danc\u0027d, sung, then cry\u0027d again, wrung his Hands, beat his own Face, and Head, and then sung, and jump\u0027d about again, like a distracted Creature: It was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the Matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me, that it was his Father. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is not easy for me to express how it mov\u0027d me to see what Extasy and filial Affection had work\u0027d in this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Father, and of his being deliver\u0027d from Death; nor indeed can I describe half the Extravagancies of his Affection after this; for he went into the Boat and out of the Boat a great many times: When he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open his Breast, and hold his Father\u0027s Head close to his Bosom, half an Hour together, to nourish it; then he took his Arms and Ankles, which were numb\u0027d and stiff with the Binding, and chaffed and rubbed them with his Hands; and I perceiving what the Case was, gave him some Rum out of my Bottle, to rub them with, which did them a great deal of Good. \\n\\n \\n\\n This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now gotten almost out of Sight; and it was happy for us that we did not; for it blew so hard within two Hours after, and before they could be gotten a Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing so hard all Night, and that from the North-west, which was against them, that I could not suppose their Boat could live, or that they ever reach\u0027d to their own Coast. \\n\\n \\n\\n But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to take him off for some time: But after I thought he could leave him a little, I call\u0027d him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas\u0027d to the highest Extream; then I ask\u0027d him, If he had given his Father any Bread? He shook his Head, and said, None: Ugly Dog eat all up self; so I gave him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry\u0027d on Purpose; I also gave him a Dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but carry\u0027d it to his Father: I had in my Pocket also two or three Bunches of my Raisins, so I gave him a Handful of them for his Father. He had no sooner given his Father these Raisins, but I saw him come out of the Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch\u0027d, he run at such a Rate; for he was the swiftest Fellow of his Foot that ever I saw; I say, he run at such a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I call\u0027d, and hollow\u0027d too, after him, it was all one, away he went, and in a Quarter of an Hour, I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his Pace was slacker, because he had some thing in his Hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he came up to me, I found he had been quite Home for an Earthen Jugg or Pot to bring his Father some fresh Water, and that he had got two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread he gave me, but the Water he carry\u0027d to his Father: However, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little Sup of it. This Water reviv\u0027d his Father more than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him; for he was just fainting with Thirst. \\n\\n \\n\\n When his Father had drank, I call\u0027d to him to know if there was any Water left; he said, yes; and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much Want of it as his Father; and I sent one of the Cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green Place under the Shade of a free; and whose Limbs were also very stiff, and very much swell\u0027d with the rude Bandage he had been ty\u0027d with. When I saw that upon Friday\u0027s coming to him with the Water, he sat up and drank, and took the Bread, and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a Handful of Raisins; he look\u0027d up in my Face with all the Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness, that could appear in any Countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the Fight, that he could not stand up upon his Feet; he try\u0027d to do it two or three times, but was really not able, his Ankles were so swell\u0027d and so painful to him; so I bad him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, as he had done his Father\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n I observ\u0027d the poor affectionate Creature every two Minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn\u0027d his Head about, to see if his Father was in the same Place, and Posture, as he left him sitting; and at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up, and without speaking a Word, flew with that Swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his Feet to touch the Ground, as he went: But when he came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his Limbs; so Friday came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and then he should carry him to our Dwelling, where I would take Care of him: But Friday, a lusty strong Fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his Back, and carry\u0027d him away to the Boat, and set him down softly upon the Side or Gunnel of the Canoe, with his Feet in the inside of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him close to his Father, and presently stepping out again, launched the Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore faster than I could walk, tho\u0027 the Wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both safe into our Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away to fetch the other Canoe. As he pass\u0027d me, I spoke to him, and ask\u0027d him, whither he went, he told me, Go fetch more Boat; so away he went like the Wind; for sure never Man or Horse run like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek, almost as soon as I got to it by Land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new Guests out of the Boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 我自从有了这些想法之后，平时就经常会想到这件事，可是因为没有机会付诸实施，因此一直都毫无结果。这样大约又过了一年半光景。一天清晨，我忽然发现有五只独木舟在岛这头靠了岸，船上的人都已上了岛，但却不知道他们去哪儿了。他们来的人这么多，把我的计划彻底打破了。因为我知道，一只独木舟一般载五、六个人，有时甚至更多。现在一下子来了这么多船，少说他有二三十人，我一个人单枪匹马，如何能对付他们呢！因此，我只好悄悄躲到城堡里去，坐立不安，一筹莫展。可是，我还是根据过去的计划，进行作战准备，以便一有机会，立即行动。我等了好久，留神听他们的动静，最后，实在耐不住了，就把枪放在梯子脚下，像平时那样，分作两步爬上小山顶。我站在那里，尽量不把头露出来，唯恐被他们看见。我拿起望远镜进行观察，发现他们不下三十人，并且已经生起了火，正在煮肉。至于他们怎样煮的，煮的又究竟是什么肉，我就不得而知了。这时，只见他们正手舞足蹈，围着火堆跳舞。他们做出种种野蛮难看的姿势，按自己的步法，正跳得不亦乐乎。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 正当我观望的时候，从望远镜里又看到他们从小船上拖出两个倒霉的野人来。这两个野人大概是他们事先放在船上的，现在拖上岸来准备屠杀了。我看到其中一个被木棍或木刀乱打一片，立即倒了下去。接着便有两三个野人一涌而上，动手把他开膛破腹，准备煮了来吃。另一个俘虏被撂在一边，到时他们再动手拿他开刀。这时，这个可怜的家伙看见自己手脚松了绑，无人管他，不由起了逃命的希望。他突然跳起身奔逃起来；他沿着海岸向我这边跑来，其速度简直惊人。我是说，他正飞速向我的住所方向跑来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我得承认，当我见他朝我这边跑来时，着实吃惊不小；因为我认为，那些野人必然全部出动来追赶他。这时，我看到，我梦境中的一部分开始实现了：那个野人必然会在我城堡外的树丛中躲起来。可是，梦境中的其余部分我可不敢相信--也就是那些野人不会来追他，也不会发现他躲在树丛里。我仍旧站在原地，一动也不动。后来，我发现追他的只有三个人，胆子就大一点了。尤其是我发现那个野人跑得比追他的三个人快得多，而且把他们愈甩愈远了。只要他能再跑上半小时，就可完全摆脱他们了。这不由使我勇气倍增。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在他们和我的城堡之间，有一条小河。这条小河，我在本书的开头部分曾多次提到过；我把破船上的东西运下来的时候，就是进入小河后搬上岸的。我看得很清楚，那逃跑的野人必须游过小河，否则就一定会被他们在河边抓祝这时正值涨潮，那逃跑的野人一到河边，就毫不犹豫纵身跳下河去，只划了三十来下便游过了河。他一爬上岸，又迅速向前狂奔。后面追他的那三个野人到了河边。其中只有两个会游水，另一个却不会，只好站在河边，看其他两个游过河去。又过了一会，他一个人就悄悄回去了。这实在救了他一命。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我注意到，那两个会游水的野人游得比那逃跑的野人慢多了；他们至少花了一倍的时间才游过了河。这时候，我脑子里突然产生一个强烈的、不可抗拒的欲望：我要找个仆人，现在正是时候；说不定我还能找到一个侣伴，一个帮手哩。这明明是上天召唤我救救这个可怜虫的命呢！我立即跑下梯子，拿起我的两支枪--前面我已提到，这两支枪就放在梯子脚下。然后，又迅速爬上梯子，翻过山顶，向海边跑去。我抄了一条近路，跑下山去，插身在追踪者和逃跑者之间。我向那逃跑的野人大声呼唤。他回头望了望，起初仿佛对我也很害怕，其程度不亚于害怕追赶他的野人。但我用手势召唤他过来，同时慢慢向后面追上来的两个野人迎上去。等他俩走近时，我一下子冲到前面的一个野人跟前，用枪杆子把他打倒在地。我不想开枪，怕枪声让其余的野人听见。其实距离这么远，枪声是很难听到的；即使隐隐约约听到了，他们也看不见硝烟，所以肯定会弄不清是怎么回事。第一个野人被我打倒之后，同他一起追来的那个野人就停住了脚步，仿佛吓住了。于是我又急步向他迎上去。当我快走近他时，见他手里拿起弓箭，准备拉弓向我放箭。我不得不先向他开枪，一枪就把他打死了。那逃跑的野人这时也停住了脚步。这可怜的家伙虽然亲眼见到他的两个敌人都已经倒下，并且在他看来已必死无疑，但却给我的枪声和火光吓坏了。他站在那里，呆若木鸡，既不进也不退，看样子他很想逃跑而不敢走近我。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我向他大声招呼，做手势叫他过来。他明白了我的意思，向前走几步停停，又走几步又停停。这时，我看到他站在那里，混身发抖。他以为自己成了我的俘虏，也将像他的两个敌人那样被杀死。我又向他招招手，叫他靠近我，并做出种种手势叫他不要害怕。他这才慢慢向前走，每走一二十步便跪一下，好像是感谢我救了他的命。我向他微笑，作出和蔼可亲的样子，并一再用手招呼他，叫他再靠近一点。最后，他走到我跟前，再次跪下，吻着地面，又把头贴在地上，把我的一只脚放到他的头上，好像在宣誓愿终身做我的奴隶。我把他扶起来，对他十分和气，并千方百计叫他不要害怕。但事情还没有完。我发现我用枪杆打倒的那个野人并没有死。他刚才是给我打昏了，现在正苏醒过来。我向他指了指那个野人，表示他还没有死。他看了之后，就叽哩咕噜向我说了几句话。虽然我不明白他的意思，可对我来说听起来特别悦耳，因为这是我二十五年来第一次听到别人和我说话，以前我最多也只能听到自己自言自语的声音。当然，现在不是多愁善感的时候。那被打倒的野人已完全清醒，并从地上坐了起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我发现被我救出的野人又有点害怕的样子，便举起另一支枪准备射击。这时，我那野人（我现在就这样叫他了）做了个手势，要我把挂在腰间的那把没鞘的刀借给他。于是我把刀给了他。他一拿到刀，就奔向他的敌人，手起刀落，一下子砍下了那个野人的头，其动作干脆利落，胜过德国刽子手。这使我大为惊讶，因为，我完全可以相信，这个人在此之前，除了他们自己的木刀外，一生中从未见过一把真正的刀。但现在看来，他们的木头刀也又快又锋利，砍头杀人照样一刀就能让人头落地。后来我了解到，事实也正是如此。他们的刀是用很硬的木头做成的，做得又沉重又锋利。再说我那野人砍下了敌人的头，带着胜利的笑声回到我跟前。他先把刀还给了我，然后做了许多莫名其妙的手势，把他砍下来的野人头放在我脚下。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是，最使他感到惊讶的，是我怎么能从这么远的距离把另一个野人打死。他用手指了指那个野人的尸体，做着手势要我让他过去看看。我也打着手势，竭力让他懂得我同意他过去。他走到那死人身边，简直惊呆了。他两眼直瞪瞪地看着死人，然后又把尸体翻来翻去，想看个究竟。他看了看枪眼，子弹正好打中那野人的胸部，在那里穿了个洞，但血流得不多，因为中弹后人马上死了，血就流到体内去了。他取下那野人的弓箭回到我跟前，我就叫他跟我离开这地方。我用手势告诉他，后面可能有更多的敌人追上来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他懂了我的意思后，就用手势表示要把两个尸体用沙土埋起来，这样追上来的野人就不会发现踪迹。我打手势叫他照办。他马上干起来，不到一会儿功夫，就用双手在沙土上创了一个坑，刚好埋一个野人。他把尸体拖了进去，用沙土盖好。接着又如法泡制，埋了第二个野人的尸体。我估计，他总共只花了一刻钟，就把两具尸体埋好了。然后，我叫他跟我一起离开这儿。我没有把他带到城堡去，而是带到岛那头的洞穴里去。我这样做是有意不让自己的梦境应验，因为在梦里，他是跑到城堡外面的树丛中躲起来的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 到了洞里，我给他吃了些面包和一串葡萄干，又给了他点水喝。因为我见他跑了半天，已经饥渴不堪了。他吃喝完毕后，我又指了指一个地方，做着手势叫他躺下来睡一觉。那儿铺了一堆干草，上面还有一条毯子，我自己有时也在上面睡觉。于是这个可怜的家伙一倒下去就呼呼睡着了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这个野人生得眉清目秀，非常英浚他身材修短合宜，四肢挺直又结实，但并不显得粗壮。他个子很高，身体健康，年纪看来约二十六岁。他五官端正，面目一点也不狰狞可憎，脸上有一种男子汉的英勇气概，又具有欧洲人那种和蔼可亲的样子，这种温柔亲切的样子在他微笑的时候表现得更为明显。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他的头发又黑又长，但不像羊毛似地卷着；他的前额又高又大，目光锐利而又活泼。他的皮肤不怎么黑，略带棕色，然而不像巴西人或弗吉尼亚人或美洲其他土人的肤色那样黄金褐色的，令人生厌，而是一种深茶青色的，油光乌亮，令人爽心悦目，劫难以用言语形容。他的脸圆圆胖胖的，鼻子却很小，但又不像一般黑人的鼻子那样扁；他的嘴形长得也很好看，嘴唇薄薄的，牙齿又平又白，白得如同象牙。他并没有睡得死死的，实际上只打了半小时的盹就醒来了。他一醒来就跑到洞外来找我，因为当时我正在挤羊奶，我的羊圈就在附近。他一见到我，立刻向我奔来，爬在地上，做出各种各样的手势和古怪的姿势，表示他臣服感激之心。最后，他又把头放在地上，靠近我的脚边，然后又像上次那样，把我的另一只脚放到他的头上，这样做之后，又向我作出各种姿势，表示顺从降服，愿终身做我的奴隶，为我效劳。他的这些意思我都明白了。我告诉他，我对他非常满意。不久，我就开始和他谈话，并教他和我谈话。首先，我告诉他，他的名字叫 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"星期五\"，这是我救他命的一天，这样取名是为了纪念这一天。我教他说\"主人\"，并告诉他这是我的名字。我还教他说\"是\"和\"不是\"，并告诉他这两个词的意思。我拿出一个瓦罐，盛了一些羊奶给他。我先喝给他看，并把面包浸在羊奶里吃给他看。然后，我给了他一块面包，叫他学我的样子吃。他马上照办了，并向我做手势，表示很好吃。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 晚上，我和他一起在地洞里睡了一夜。天一亮，我就叫他跟我一起出去，并告诉他，我要给他一些衣服穿。他明白了我的意思后，显得很高兴，因为他一直光着身子，一丝不挂。当我们走过他埋下两个尸体的地方时，他就把那地方指给我看，并告诉我他所做的记号。他向我做着手势，表示要把尸体掘出来吃掉！对此，我表示十分生气，我向他表明，对人吃人这种残忍的行为我深恶痛绝。我做出一想到这种罪恶勾当就要呕吐的样子。然后，我向他招手，叫他马上走开。他立即十分驯服地跟着我走了。我把他带到那小山顶上，看看他的敌人有没有走。我拿出望远镜，一眼就看到了他们昨天聚集的地方。但那些野人和独木舟都不见了。显然他们上船走了，并且把他们的两个同伴丢在岛上，连找都没有找他们。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我对这一发现并不感到满足。现在，我勇气倍增，好奇心也随之增大。因此，我带了我的奴隶星期五，准备到那边看个究竟。我给了他一把刀，让他拿在手里，他自己又把弓箭背在背上--我已经了解到，他是一个出色的弓箭手。另外，我还叫他给我背一支枪，而我自己则背了两支枪。这样武装好之后，我们就向那些野人昨天聚集过的地方出发了，因为我很想获得有关那些野人充分的情报。一到那里，呈现在我面前的是一起惨绝人寰的景象，我血管里的血不由得都冰冷了，连心脏也停止了跳动。那真是一幅可怕的景象，至少对我而言实在惨不忍睹，可是对星期五来说，根本不当一回事。那儿遍地都是死人骨头和人肉，鲜血染红了土地；那大片大片的人肉，有的吃了一半，有的砍烂了，有的烧焦了，东一块西一块的，一片狼藉。总之，到处都是他们战胜敌人之后举行人肉宴的痕迹。我看到一共有三个骷髅，五只人手，三四根腿骨和脚骨，还有不少人体的其他部分。星期五用手势告诉我，他们一共带来了四个俘虏来这儿举行人肉宴，三个已经吃掉了。他是第四个。说到这里，他还指了指自己。他又告诉我，那些野人与他们的部族的新王发生了一次激烈的战争，而他自己是新王的臣员。他们这一边也抓了大批俘虏；这些俘虏被带到不同的地方杀掉吃了，就像那些野人把他们带到这儿杀了吃掉一样。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我让星期五把所有的骷髅、人骨和人肉以及那些野人吃剩下来的东西收集在一起，堆成一堆，然后点上火把它们通通烧成灰烬。我发现星期五对那些人肉仍垂涎欲滴，不改他吃人的天性。但我明显地表现出对吃人肉的事极端憎恶，不要说看到这种事，甚至连想都不愿想。我还设法让他明白，如果他敢再吃一口人肉，我就把他杀了，这才使他不敢有所表示。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 办完这件事后，我们就回到城堡里去了。一到那里，我就开始为星期五的穿着忙碌起来。首先，我给了他一条麻纱短裤。这条短裤是我从那条失事船上死去的炮手箱子里找出来的。这件事我前面已提到过了。短裤略改一下，刚刚合他的身。然后，我又用羊皮给他做了件背心。我尽我所能缝制这件背心。应该说，我现在的裁缝手艺已相当不错了。另外，我又给了他一顶兔皮帽子，戴起来挺方便，样子也很时髦。现在，他的这身穿戴也还过得去了。他看到自己和主人几乎穿得一样好，心里十分高兴。说句实话，开始他刚穿上这些衣服时，深感行动不便；不但裤子穿起来感到很别扭，而且，背心的袖筒磨痛了他的肩膀和胳肢窝。后来我把那使他难受的地方略微放宽了一些，再加上对穿衣服也感到慢慢习惯了，他就喜欢上他的衣着了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 回到家里第二天，我就考虑怎样安置星期五的问题。我又要让他住得好，又要保证自己绝对安全。为此，我在两道围墙之间的空地上，给他搭了一个小小的帐篷，也就是说，这小帐篷搭在内墙之外，外墙之内。在内墙上本来就有一个入口通进山洞。因此，我在入口处做了个门柜和一扇木板门。门是从里面开的。一到晚上，我就把门从里面闩上，同时把梯子也收了进来。这样，如果星期五想通过内墙来到我身边，就必然会弄出许多声响，也就一定会把我惊醒。因为我在内墙和岩壁之间用长木条作椽子搭了一个屋顶，把我的帐篷完全遮盖了起来。椽子上又横搭了许多小木条，上面盖了一层厚厚的、像芦苇一样结实的稻草。在我用梯子爬进爬出的地方，又装了一个后门。从外面把门打开，是绝对不可能的，这样做，活门就会自动落下来，从而发出很大的声响。此外，我每夜都把武器放在身边，以备不时之需。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 其实，对星期五，我根本用不着采取任何防范措施。任何其他人都不可能有像星期五这样忠诚老实、听话可爱的仆人。他没有脾气，性格开朗，不怀鬼胎，对我又顺从又热心。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他对我的感情，就像孩子对父亲的感情，一往情深。我可以说，无论何时何地，他都宁愿牺牲自己的生命来保护我。后来，他的许多表现都证明了这一点，并使我对此毫不怀疑。因此，我深信，对他我根本不用防备。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这不由得使我经常想到，上帝对世事的安排，自有其天意，在其对自己所创造的万物的治理中，一方面他剥夺了世界上许多生物的才干和良知，另一方面，他照样赋予他们与我们文明人同样的能力，同样的理性，同样的感情，同样的善心和责任感，也赋予他们同样的嫉恶如仇的心理；他们与我们一样知道感恩图报，诚恳待人，忠贞不渝，相互为善。而且，当上帝给他们机会表现这些才干和良知时，他们和我们一样，立即把上帝赋予他们的才干和良知发挥出来做各种好事，甚至可以说比我们自己发挥得更充分。对此，我不能不感到惊讶。同时，想到这些，我又感到有些悲哀，因为许多事实证明，我们文明人在发挥这些才干和良知方面，反而显得非常卑劣。尽管我们不仅有能力，而且，我们受到上帝的教诲，上帝的圣灵和上帝的语言的启示，这使我们能有更深刻的认识。同时，我也感到奇怪，为什么上帝不给这成千上百万的生灵以同样的教诲和启示，使他们懂得赎罪的道理。我觉得，如果我以这可怜的野人作为判断的依据，那么，他们实在能比我们文明人做得更好。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 关于这些问题，我有时甚至会想过头，以至冒犯了上帝的统治权，认为他对世事的安排欠公正，因为他把他的教诲赐予了一部分人，而不赐予另一部分人，但却又要这两部分人负起同样的义务。但我终于打消了这种想法，并得出了以下的结论：第一，我们不知道上帝根据什么神意和律法来给这些人定罪。上帝既然是神，他必然是无限神圣，无限公正的。假如上帝作出判决，不把他的教诲赐给这些人，那一定是因为他们违反了上帝的教诲，也就是违反了《圣经》上所说的他们自己的律法；而上帝的判决，也是以他们的良心所承认的法则为标准的，虽然这些法则所依据的原则还没有被我们了解。第二，上帝就像陶匠，我们都是陶匠手里的陶土；没有一样陶器可以对陶匠说：\"你为什么把我做成这个样子？\"现在再来谈谈我的新伙伴吧。我对他非常满意，并决定教会他做各种各样的事情，使他成为我有用的助手，特别是要教会他说英语，并听懂我说的话。他非常善于学习，尤其是学习时总是兴致勃勃，勤勤恳恳；每当他听懂了我的话，或是我听懂了他的话，他就欢天喜地，十分高兴。因此，与他谈话对我来说实在是一件乐事。现在，我生活变得顺心多了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我甚至对自己说，只要不再碰到那批食人生番，哪怕永远不离开这个地方，我也不在乎。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 回到城堡两三天之后，我觉得应该戒掉星期五那种可怕的吃相，尤其是要戒掉他吃人的习惯。为此，我想应该让他尝尝别的肉类的味道。所以，一天早晨，我带他到树林里去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我原来想从自己的羊圈里选一只小羊，把它杀了带回家煮了吃。可是，走到半路上，我发现有一只母羊躺在树荫下，身边还有两只小羊坐在那儿。我一把扯住星期五，并对他说：\"站住别动。\"同时打手势，叫他不要动。接着我举起枪，开枪打死了一只小羊。可怜的星期五上次曾看到我用枪打死了他的敌人，但当时他站在远处，弄不清是怎么回事，也想象不出我是怎样把他的敌人打死的。可这一次他看到我开枪，着实吃惊不少；他浑身颤抖，简直吓呆了，差一点瘫倒在地上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他既没有去看我开枪射击的那只小羊，也没有看到我已把小羊打死了，只顾扯开他自己的背心，在身上摸来摸去，看看自己有没有受伤。原来他以为我要杀死他。他跑到我跟前，扑通一声跪下来抱住我的双腿，嘴里叽哩咕噜说了不少话，我都不懂。但我不难明白他的意思，那就是求我不要杀他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我马上想出办法使他相信，我决不会伤害他。我一面用手把他从地上扶起来，一面哈哈大笑，并用手指着那打死的小羊，叫他跑过去把它带回来。他马上跑过去了。他在那里查看小山羊是怎样被打死的，并感到百思不得其解。这时我趁此机会重新把枪装上了子弹。不久，我看见一只大鸟，样子像一只苍鹰，正落在我射程内的一棵树上。为了让星期五稍稍明白我是怎样开枪的，就叫他来到我跟前。我用手指了指那只鸟--现在我看清了，其实那是一只鹦鹉，而我原先把它当作苍鹰了。我刚才说了，我用手指了指那只鹦鹉，又指了指自己的枪和鹦鹉身子底下的地方，意思是说，我要开枪把那只鸟打下来。于是，我开了枪了，并叫他仔细看好。他立即看到那鹦鹉掉了下来。他再次吓得站在那里呆住了，尽管我事先已把事情给他交待清楚了。尤其使他感到惊讶的是，他没有看到我事先把弹药装到枪里去，因此就以为枪里一定有什么神奇的致命的东西，可以把人哪，鸟哪，野兽哪，以及远远近近的任何生物都杀死。他这种惊讶好久好久都不能消失。我相信，如果我让他这样下去，他一定会把我和我的枪当神一样来崇拜呢！至于那支枪，事后好几天，他连碰都不敢碰它，还经常一个人唠唠叨叨地跟它说话谈天，仿佛枪会回答他似的。后来我才从他口里知道，他是在祈求那支枪不要杀害他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 当时，我等他的惊讶心情略微平静下来之后，就用手指了指那只鸟掉下去的地方，叫他跑过去把鸟取来。于是他去了好半天才回来。原来那只鹦鹉还没有一下子死掉，落下来之后，又拍着翅膀挣扎了一阵子，扑腾到别处去了。可是星期五还是把它找到了，并取来给了我。我见他对我的枪感到神秘莫测，就趁他去取鸟的机会重新装上弹药，并不让他看见我是怎样装弹药的，以便碰到任何其他目标时可以随时开枪。可是，后来没有碰到任何可以值得开枪的目标，就只把那只小羊带回了家。当晚我就把它剥皮，把肉切好。我本来就有一只专门煮肉的罐子，就把一部分肉放到里面煮起来，做成了鲜美的羊肉汤。我先吃了一点，然后也给了点他吃。他吃了之后，感到非常高兴，并表示很喜欢吃。但最使他感到奇怪的是，他看到我在肉和肉汤里放盐。他向我做手势，表示盐不好吃。他把一点盐放在嘴里，做出作呕的样子，呸呸地吐了一阵子，又赶紧用清水嗽了嗽口。我也拿了一块没有放盐的肉放在嘴里，也假装呸呸地吐了一阵子，表示没有盐肉就吃不下去，正像他有盐吃不下去一样。但这没有用。他就是不喜欢在肉里或汤里放盐。过了很长一段时间之后，他也只是放很少一点盐。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 吃过煮羊肉和羊肉汤之后，我决定第二天请他吃烤羊肉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我按照英国的烤法，在火的两边各插一根有叉的木竿，上面再搭上一根横竿，再用绳子把肉吊在横竿上，让它不断转动。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五对我这种烤肉方法十分惊异。但当他尝了烤羊肉的味道后，用各种方法告诉我他是多么爱吃这种味道；我当然不可能不了解他的意思。最后，他告诉我，他从此之后再也不吃人肉了。听到他讲这句话，我感到非常高兴。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二天，我叫他去打谷，并把谷筛出来。筛谷的办法我前面已提到过了，我让他照着我的办法做。不久，他打谷筛谷就做得和我一样好，尤其是当他懂得这项工作的意义后，干得更卖力。因为我等他打完谷之后，就让他看看我做面包、烤面包。这时，他就明白，打谷是为了做面包用的。没多久，他也能做面包、烤面包了，而且做得和我一样好。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，我也考虑到，现在既然添了一张嘴吃饭，就得多开一点地，多种一点粮食。于是，我又划了一块较大的地，像以前一样把地圈起来。星期五对这工作干得又主动，又卖力，而且干起活来总是高高兴兴的。我又把这项工作的意义告诉他，使他知道现在添了他这个人，就得多种些粮食，多做些面包，这样才够我们两个人吃。他似乎很能领会这个意思，并表示他知道，我为他干的活比为我自己干的活还多。所以，只要告诉他怎么干，他一定会尽心竭力地去干。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这是我来到荒岛上度过的最愉快的一年。星期五的英语已说得相当不错了，也差不多完全能明白我要他拿的每一样东西的名称和我差他去的每一个地方，而且，还喜欢一天到晚跟我谈话。以前，我很少有机会说话；现在，我的舌头终于又可以用来说话了。我与他谈话真是快乐无比。不仅如此，我对他的人品也特别满意。相处久了，我越来越感到他是多么地天真诚实，我真的打从心底里喜欢上了他。同时，我也相信，他爱我胜过爱任何人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 有一次，我有心想试试他，看他是否还怀念自己的故乡。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，我觉得他英语已讲得相当不错了，几乎能回答我提出的任何问题。我问他，他的部族是否在战争中从不打败仗。听了我的问题，他笑了。他回答说： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"是的，是的，我们一直打得比人家好。\"他的意思是说，在战斗中，他们总是占优势。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 由此，我们开始了下面的对话：\"你们一直打得比人家好，\"我说，\"那你怎么会被抓住当了俘虏呢，星期五？\"星期五：我被抓了，但我的部族打赢了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 主人：怎么打赢的呢？如果你的部族打赢了，你怎么会被他们抓住呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五：在我打仗的地方，他们的人比我们多。他们抓住了一个、两个、三个，还有我。在另一个地方，我的部族打败了他们。那儿，我们抓了他们一两千人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 主人：可是，你们的人为什么不把你们救回去呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五：他们把一个、两个、三个，还有我，一起放到独木舟上逃跑了。我们的部族那时正好没有独木舟。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 主人：那么，星期五，你们的部族怎么处置抓到的人呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们是不是也把俘虏带到一个地方，像你的那些敌人那样，把他们杀了吃掉？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五：是的，我们的部族也吃人肉，把他们统统吃光。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 主人：他们把人带到哪儿去了？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五：带到别的地方去了，他们想去的地方。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 主人：他们到这个岛上来过吗？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五：是的，是的，他们来过。也到别的地方去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 主人：你跟他们来过这儿吗？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五：是的，我来过这儿（他用手指了指岛的西北方。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 看来，那是他们常去的地方。）。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 通过这次谈话，我了解到，我的仆人星期五，以前也经常和那些生番一起，在岛的另一头上岸，干那吃人的勾当，就像他这一次被带到岛上来，差一点也给别的生番吃掉。过了几天后，我鼓起勇气，把他带到岛的那一头，也就是我前面提到过的那地方。他马上认出了那地方。他告诉我，他到过这地方一次，吃了二十个男人、两个女人和一个小孩。他还不会用英语数到二十，所以用了许多石块在地上排成了长长的一行，用手指了指那行石块告诉我这个数字。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我把这一段谈话叙述出来，是因为它与下面的事情有关。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 那就是，在我与他谈过这次话之后，我就问他，小岛离大陆究竟有多远，独木舟是否经常出事？他告诉我没有任何危险，独木舟也从未出过事。但在离小岛不远处，有一股急流和风，上午是一个方向，下午又是一个方向。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 起初我还以为这不过是潮水的关系，有时往外流，有时往里流。后来我才弄明白，那是由于那条叫作奥里诺科河的大河倾泻入海，形成回流之故。而我们的岛，刚好是在该河的一处入海口上。我在西面和西北面看到的陆地，正是一个大岛，叫特里尼达岛，正好在河口的北面。我向星期五提出了无数的问题，问到这一带的地形、居民、海洋、海岸，以及附近居住着什么民族。他毫无保留地把他所知道的一切都告诉了我，态度十分坦率。我又问他，他们这个民族分成多少部落，叫什么名字。可问来问去只问出一个名字，就是加勒比人。于是我马上明白，他所说的是加勒比群岛，在我们的地图上，是属于美洲地区；这些群岛从奥里诺科河河口，一直延伸到圭亚那，再延伸到圣马大。他指着我的胡子对我说，在月落的地方，离这儿很远很远，也就是说，在他们国土的西面。住着许多像我这样有胡子的白人。又说，他们在那边杀了很多很多的人。从他的话里，我明白他指的是西班牙人。他们在美洲的杀人暴行在各民族中臭名远扬，并且在这些民族中世代相传。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我问他能不能告诉我怎样才能从这个岛上到那些白人那边去。他对我说：\"是的，是的，可以坐两只独木船去。\"我不明白\"坐两只独木舟去\"是什么意思，也无法使他说明\"两只独木船\"的意思。到最后，费了好大的劲，我才弄清楚他的意思。原来是要用一只很大很大的船，要像两只独木船那样大。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五的谈话使我很感兴趣。从那时期，我就抱着一种希望，但愿有一天能有机会从这个荒岛上逃出去，并指望这个可怜的野人能帮助我达到目的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，星期五与我在一起生活了相当长一段时间了，他渐渐会和我谈话了，也渐渐听得懂我的话了。在这段时间里，我经常向他灌输一些宗教知识。特别有一次，我问他：他是谁创造出来的？这可怜的家伙一点也不明白我的意思，以为是我在问他谁是他的父亲。我就换一个方法问他：大海，我们行走的大地、高山、树林，都是谁创造出来的？他告诉我，是一位叫贝纳木基的老人创造出来的，这位老人住在很远很远的地方。但无法告诉我这位伟大的老人究竟是怎么样的一个人，只是说他年纪很大很大，比大海和陆地、月亮和星星年纪都大。我又问他： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"既然这位老人家创造了万物，万物为什么不崇拜他呢？\"他脸上马上显出既庄重又天真的神气说：\"万物都对他说\u0027哦\u0027。\"于是我又问他：在他们国家里，人死之后都到什么地方去了？他说：\"是的，都到贝纳木基老人那里去了。\"接着我又问他：他们吃掉的人是不是也到那里去了？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 他说：\"是的。\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 从这些事情入手，我逐渐教导他，使他认识真正的神是上帝。我指着天空对他说，万物的伟大创造者就住在天上，并告诉他，上帝用神力和神意创造了世界，治理着世界。我还告诉他，上帝是万能的，他能为我们做任何事情，他能把一切都赐予我们，也能把一切从我们手里夺走。就这样，我逐渐使他睁开了眼睛。他专心致志地听我讲，并且很乐意接受我向他灌输的观念：基督是被派来替我们赎罪的。他也乐意学着向上帝祈祷，并知道，上帝在天上能听到他的祈祷。有一天，他对我说，上帝能从比太阳更远的地方听到我们的话，他必然是比贝纳木基更伟大的神。因为贝纳木基住的地方不算太远，可他却听不到他们的话，除非他们到他住的那座山里去向他谈话。我问他：他可曾去过那儿与他谈过话？他说：没有，青年人从来不去，只有那些被称为奥乌卡儿的老人才去。经过他解释，我才知道，所谓奥乌卡儿，就是他们部族的祭司或僧侣。据他说，他们到那儿去说\"哦\"，（他说，这是他们的祈祷。）然后就回来，把贝纳木基的话告诉他们。从星期五的话里，我可以推断，即使是世界上最盲目无知的邪教徒中，也存在着祭司制度；同时，我也发现，把宗教神秘化，从而使人们能敬仰神职人员，这种做法不仅存在于罗马天主教，也存在于世界上一切宗教，甚至也存在于最残忍、最野蛮的野人中间。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我竭力向我的仆人星期五揭发这一骗局。我告诉他，那些老人假装到山里去对贝纳木基说\"哦\"，完全是骗人的把戏。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们说他们把贝纳木基的话带回来，更是骗人的诡计。我对他说，假如他们在那儿真的听到什么，真的在那边同什么人谈过话，那也一定是魔鬼。然后，我用很长的时间跟他谈魔鬼的问题：魔鬼的来历，他对上帝的反叛，他对人类的仇恨及其原因，他怎样统治着世界最黑暗的地方，叫人像礼拜上帝一样礼拜他，以及他怎样用种种阴谋诡计诱惑人类走上绝路，又怎样偷偷潜入我们的情欲和感情，迎合着我们的心理来安排他的陷阱，使我们自己诱惑自己，甘心走上灭亡的道路。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我发现，让他对上帝的存在获得正确的观念还算容易，但要使他对魔鬼有正确的认识，就不那么容易了。我可以根据许多自然现象向他证明，天地间必须要有一个最高的主宰，一种统治一切的力量，一种冥冥中的引导者，并向他证明，崇敬我们自己的创造者，是完全公正合理的，如此等等，不一而足。可是，关于魔鬼的观念，他的起源，他的存在，他的本性，特别是他一心作恶并引诱人类作恶的意图等等，我却找不出现成的证明。因此，有一次，这可怜的家伙向我提出了一个又自然又天真的问题，就一下子把我难住了，简直不知怎样回答他才好。在此以前，我一直跟他谈关于上帝的问题：上帝的权威，上帝的全知全能，上帝嫉恶如仇的本性，以及他怎样用烈火烧死那些奸恶不义之徒。关于这些问题，我同他谈得很多。我还向他谈到，上帝既然创造了万物，他也可以在一刹那间把全世界和我们全人类都毁灭。在我谈话的时候，他总是非常认真地听着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 然后，我又告诉他，在人们心里，魔鬼是上帝的敌人。他一贯心存恶意，使尽阴谋诡计来破坏上帝善良的计划，试图毁灭世界上的基督天国等等。于是，星期五说：\"你说，上帝是强大的，伟大的，他不是比魔鬼更强大、更有力吗？\"\"是的，是的，\"我说，\"星期五，上帝比魔鬼更强大，上帝高于魔鬼。因此，我们应该祈祷上帝，使我们有力量把魔鬼踩在我们的脚下，并使我们有力量抵制他的诱惑，扑灭他的火箭。\"\"可是，\"\"星期五又问，\"既然上帝比魔鬼更强大、更有力，为什么上帝不把魔鬼杀死，免得他再作恶事呢？\"他这个问题大大出乎我意料之外。因为，尽管我现在年纪已很大了，但作为一个教导别人的老师，却资历很浅，我不善于解决道德良心的问题，也不够资格辩难决疑。我一时不知怎么回答他才好，就只好装作没听清他的话，问他说的是什么。可是，星期五是十分认真的，当然不会忘记他的问题，所以又把刚才提的问题用英语结结巴巴地重复了一遍。这时，我已略略恢复了镇静，就回答他说：\"上帝最终将严惩魔鬼，魔鬼必定受到审判，并将被投入无底的深渊，经受地狱之火的熬炼，永世不得翻身。\"这个回答当然不能使星期五满意，他用我的话回问我：\"最终、必定，我不懂。但是，为什么不现在就把魔鬼杀掉？为什么不老早就把魔鬼杀掉？\"我回答说：\"你这样问我，就等于问为什么上帝不把你和我杀掉，因为，我们也犯了罪，得罪了上帝。上帝留着我们，是让我们自己有机会忏悔，有机会获得赦免。\"他把我的话想了好半天，最后，他显得很激动，并对我说：\"对啦，对啦，你、我、魔鬼都有罪，上帝留着我们，是让我们忏悔，让我们都获得赦免。\"谈到这里，我又被他弄得十分尴尬。他的这些话使我充分认识到，虽然天赋的观念可以使一般有理性的人认识上帝，可以使他们自然而然地对至高无上的上帝表示崇拜和敬礼，然而，要认识到耶稣基督，要认识到他曾经替我们赎罪，认识到他是我们同上帝之间所立的新约的中间人，认识到他是我们在上帝宝座前的仲裁者，那就非要神的启示不可。这就是说，只有神的启示，才能使我们在灵魂里形成这些认识。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 因此，只有救主耶稣的普渡众生的福音，只有上帝的语言和上帝的圣灵，才能成为人类灵魂绝对不可少的引导者，帮助我们认识上帝拯救人类的道理，以及我们获救的方法。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 因此，我马上把我和星期五之间的谈话岔到别的事情上去。我匆匆忙忙站起来，仿佛突然想到一件什么要紧的事情，必须出去一下。同时，我又找了一个借口，把他差到一个相当远的地方去办件什么事。等他走后，我就十分挚诚地祷告上帝，祈求他赐予我教导这个可怜的野人的好方法，祈求他用他的圣灵帮助这可怜无知的人从基督身上接受上帝的真理，和基督结合在一起；同时期求他指导我用上帝的语言同这个野人谈话，以便使这可怜的家伙心悦诚服，睁开眼睛，灵魂得救。当星期五从外面回来时，我又同他进行了长时间的谈话，谈到救世主耶稣代人赎罪的事，谈到从天上来的福音的道理，也就是说，谈到向上帝忏悔、信仰救主耶稣等这一类事情。然后，我又尽可能向他解释，为什么我们的救主不以天使的身份出现，而降世为亚伯拉罕的后代，为什么那些被贬谪的天使不能替人类赎罪，以及耶稣的降生是为了挽救迷途的以色列人等等道理。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 事实上，在教导他的时候，我所采用的方法，诚意多于知识。同时，我也必须承认，在向他说明这些道理时，我自己在不少问题上也获得了很多知识；这些问题有的我过去自己也不了解，有的我过去思考得不多，现在因为要教导星期五，自然而然地进行了深入的思考。我想，凡是诚心帮助别人的人，都会有这种边教边学的体会。我感到自己现在探讨这些问题的热情比以前更大了。所以，不管这个可怜的野人将来对我是否有帮助，我也应该感谢他的出现。现在，我不再像以前那样整日愁眉苦脸了，生活也逐渐愉快起来。每当我想到，在这种孤寂的生活中，我不但自己靠近了上帝，靠近了造物主，而且还受到了上帝的启示，去挽救一个可怜的野人的生命和灵魂，使他认识了基督教这一唯一正宗的宗教和基督教义的真谛，使他认识了耶稣基督，而认识耶稣基督就意味着获得永生。每当想到这里，我的灵魂便充满快乐，这是一种真正内心感觉到的欢愉。现在我觉得我能流落到这荒岛上来，实在是一件值得庆幸的事，而在此之前，我却认为是我生平最大的灾难呢！ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 我怀着这种感恩的心情，度过了我在岛上的最后几年。在我和星期五相处的三年中，因为有许多时间同他谈话，日子过得完满幸福，如果在尘世生活中真有 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"完满幸福\"的话。这野人现在已成了一个虔诚的基督徒，甚至比我自己还要虔诚。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 当然，我完全有理由希望，并为此我要感谢上帝，我们两人都能成为真正悔罪的人，并从悔罪中得到安慰，彻底洗心革面，改过自新。在这里，我们有《圣经》可读，这就意味着我们离圣灵不远，可以获得他的教导，就像在英国一样。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我经常诵读《圣经》，并尽量向他解释《圣经》中那些词句的意义。星期五也认真钻研，积极提问。这使我对《圣经》的知识比一个人阅读时钻研得更深，了解得更多了。这一点我前面也已提到。此外，根据我在岛上这段隐居生活的经历，我还不得不提出一点自己的体会。我觉得关于对上帝的认识和耶稣救人的道理，在《圣经》中写得这样明明白白，这样容易接受，容易理解，这对人类实在是一种无限的、难以言喻的幸福。因为，仅仅阅读《圣经》，就能使自己认识到自己的责任，并勇往直前地去担负起这样一个重大的任务：真诚地忏悔自己的罪行，依靠救主耶稣来拯救自己，在实践中改造自己，服从上帝的一切指示；而所有这些认识，都是在没有别人的帮助和教导下获得的（这儿的\"别人\"，我是指自己的同类--人类），而只要自己阅读《圣经》就能无师自通。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 而且，这种浅显明白的教导，还能启发这个野人，使他成为我生平所少见的虔诚的基督徒。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 至于世界上所发生的一切有关宗教的争执、纠缠、斗争和辩论，无论是教义上微细的分别，还是教会行政上的种种计谋，对我们来说，都毫无用处。并且，在我看来，对世界上其他人也毫无用处。我们走向天堂最可靠的指南就是《圣经》--上帝的语言。感谢上帝，上帝的圣灵用上帝的语言教导我们，引导我们认识真理，使我们心悦诚服地服从上帝的指示。所以，即使我们十分了解造成世界上巨大混乱的那些宗教上的争执，在我看来对我们也毫无用处。现在，我还是把一些重要的事情，按发生的先后顺序，继续讲下去吧。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我和星期五成了好朋友，我说的话，他几乎都能听懂；他自己的英语尽管说得不太地道，但已能相当流利地与我交谈了。这时，我就把自己的身世告诉了他，特别是我怎样流落到这小岛上来，怎样在这儿生活，在这儿已多少年了等等。我又把火药和子弹的秘密告诉了他，因为，在他看来，这确实是个秘密，并教会了他开枪。我还给了他一把刀，对此他高兴极了。我又替他做了一条皮带，皮带上挂了一个佩刀的搭环，就像在英国我们用来佩刀的那种搭环。不过，在搭环上，我没有让他佩腰刀，而是给他佩了把斧头，因为斧头不仅在战斗时可以派用场，而且在平时用处更多。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我把欧洲的情况，特别是我的故乡英国的情况，说给他听，告诉他我们是怎样生活的，我们怎样崇拜上帝，人与人之间又怎样互相相处，以及怎样乘船到世界各地做生意。我又把我所乘的那条船出事的经过告诉他，并指给他看沉船的大致地方。至于那条船，早已给风浪打得粉碎，现在连影子都没有了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我又把那只小艇的残骸指给他看，也就是我们逃命时翻掉的那只救生艇。我曾经竭尽全力想把它推到海里去，但怎么使劲小艇都分毫不动。现在，这小艇也已差不多烂成碎片了。星期五看到那只小艇，站在那里出神了好一会儿，一句话也不说。我问他在想些什么。他说，\"我看到过这样的小船到过我们的地方。\"我好半天都不明白他的意思。最后，经过详细追问，我才明白他的意思：曾经有一只小艇，同这只一模一样，在他们住的地方靠岸，而且，据他说，小艇是给风浪冲过去的。由此，我马上联想到，这一定是一只欧洲的商船在他们海岸附近的海面上失事了，那小艇是被风浪打离了大船，飘到他们海岸上。当时，我的头脑真是迟钝极了，我怎么也没有想到有人也许从失事的船只上乘小艇逃生，到了他们那边。至于那是些什么人，我当然更是想都没有想过。因此，我只是要星期五把那只小艇的样子详详细细地给我描绘一番。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五把小艇的情况说得很清楚。后来，他又很起劲地补充说：\"我们又从水里救出了一些白人。\"这才使我进一步了解了他的意思。我马上问他小艇上有没有白人。他说：\"有，满满一船，都是白人。\"我问他有多少白人，他用手指头扳着告诉我，一共有十七个。我又问他们现在的下落。他回答说：\"他们都活着，他们就住在我们的部落里。\"他的话马上使我产生了新的联想。我想，那些白人一定是我上次在岛上看到出事的那条大船上的船员。他们在大船触礁后，知道船早晚会沉没，就上小艇逃生了。他们到了野人聚居的蛮荒的海岸上了岸。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 因此，我更进一步仔仔细细地打听了那些白人的下落。星期五再三告诉我，他们现在仍住在那里，已经住了四年了。野人们不去打扰他们，还供给他们粮食吃。我问他，他们为什么不把那些白人杀了吃掉呢？星期五说：\"不，我们和他们成了兄弟。\"对此，我的理解是，他们之间有一个休战协议。接着，他又补充说： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"他们只是打仗时吃人，平时是不吃人的。\"这就是说，他们只吃战争中所抓到的俘虏，平时一般是不吃人的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 此后过了很久，有一天，天气晴朗，我和星期五偶然走上岛东边的那座小山顶。在那儿，也是在一个晴朗的日子里，我曾看到了美洲大陆。当时，星期五全神贯注地朝大陆方向眺望了一会儿，忽然出乎意外地手舞足蹈起来，还把我叫了过去，因为我恰好不在他身边，离开他还有几步路。我问他是怎么回事。他说： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"噢，真高兴！真快活！我看到了我的家乡，我看到了自己的部落了！\"这时，我只见他脸上现出一种异乎寻常的欣喜。他双眼闪闪发光，流露出一种热切兴奋和神往的神色，仿佛想立刻返回他故乡去似的。看到他这种心情，我胡思乱想起来。我对星期五不由起了戒心，因而与他也不像以前那样融洽了。我毫不怀疑，只要星期五能回到自己的部落中去，他不但会忘掉他的宗教信仰，而且也会忘掉他对我的全部义务。他一定会毫不犹豫地把我的情况告诉他部落里的人，说不定还会带上一两百他的同胞到岛上来，拿我来开一次人肉宴。那时，他一定会像吃战争中抓来的俘虏那样一样兴高采烈。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我的这些想法实在大大冤枉了这个可怜的老实人。为此，我后来对他感到十分歉意。可是，当时我的疑虑有增无已，一连好几个星期都不能排除。我对他采取了不少防范的措施，对待他也没有像以前那样友好，那样亲热了。这样做，我又大大地错了。其实，他和从前一样，既忠实，又感恩，根本就没有想到这些事情上去。后来的事实也证明，他既是一位虔诚的基督徒，又是一位知恩图报的朋友。他的这种品质实在使我非常满意。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可是，在我对他的疑惧没有消除之前，我每天都要试探他，希望他无意中会暴露出自己的思想，以证实我对他的怀疑。可是我却发现，他说的每一句话都那么诚实无瑕，实在找不出任何可以让我疑心的东西。因此，尽管我心里很不踏实，他还是赢得了我的信任。在此期间，他一点也没有看出我对他的怀疑，我也没有根据疑心他是在装假。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 有一天，我们又走上了那座小山。但这一次海上雾蒙蒙的，根本看不见大陆。我对星期五说：\"星期五，你不想回到自己的家乡，回到自己的部族去吗？\"他说： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"是的，我很想回到自己的部族去。\"我说：\"你回去打算做什么呢？你要重新过野蛮生活，再吃人肉，像从前那样做个食人生番吗？\"他脸上马上显出郑重其事的样子，拼命摇着头说：\"不，不，星期五要告诉他们做好人，告诉他们要祈祷上帝，告诉他们要吃谷物面包，吃牛羊肉，喝牛羊奶，不要再吃人肉。\"我说：\"那他们就会杀死你。\"他一听这话，脸上显出很庄重的神色说：\"不，他们不会杀我。他们爱学习。\"他的意思是说，他们愿意学习。接着，他又补充说他们已经从小艇上来的那些有胡子的人那儿学了不少新东西。然后，我又问他是否想回去。他笑着对我说，他不能游那么远。我告诉他，我可以给他做条独木舟。他说，如果我愿意跟他去，他就去。\"我去？\"我说，\"我去了他们不就把我吃掉了？\"\"不会的，不会的，\"他说，\"我叫他们不吃你。我叫他们爱你，非常非常爱你！\"他的意思是说，他会告诉他们我怎样杀死了他的敌人，救了他的命。所以，他会使他们爱我。接着，他又竭力描绘他们对待那十七个白人怎么怎么好。那些白人是在船只遇难后上岸到他们那儿的，他叫他们\"有胡子的人\"。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 从这时期，我得承认，我很想冒险渡海过去，看看能否与那些有胡子的人会合。我毫不怀疑，那些人不是西班牙人，就是葡萄牙人。我也毫不怀疑，一旦我能与他们会合，就能设法从这儿逃走。因为，一方面我们在大陆上；另一方面，我们成群结伙，人多势众。这要比我一个人孤立无援，从离大陆四十海里的小岛上逃出去容易多了。所以，过了几天之后，我又带星期五外出工作，谈话中我对他说，我将给他一条船，可以让他回到自己的部族那儿去。为此，我把他带到小岛另一头存放小船的地方。我一直把船沉在水底下，所以，到了那儿，我先把船里的水排干，再让船从水里浮上来给他看，并和他一起坐了上去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我发觉他是一个驾船的能手，可以把船划得比我快一倍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 所以，在船上，我对他说：\"好啦，星期五，我们可以到你的部族去了吗？\"听了我的话，他楞住了。看来，他似乎是嫌这船太小，走不了那么远。这时，我又告诉他，我还有一只大一点的船。于是，第二天，我又带他到我存放我造的第一只船的地方，那只船我造了却无法下水。他说，船倒是够大。可是，我一直没有保护它，在那儿一躺就是二十二、三年，被太阳晒得到处干裂并朽烂了。星期五告诉我，这样的船就可以了，可以载\"足够的食物、饮水和面包。\"他是这样说的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 总之，我这时已一心一意打算同星期五一起到大陆上去了。我对他说，我们可以动手造一条跟这一样大的船，让他坐着回家。他一句话也没有说，脸上显出很庄重、很难过的样子。我问他这是怎么回事。他反问我道：\"你为什么生星期五的气？我做错了什么事？\"我问他这么说是什么意思，并告诉他，我根本没有生他的气。\"没有生气！没有生气！\"他把这句话说了一遍又一遍。\"没有生气为什么要把星期五打发回家？\"我说：\"星期五，你不是说你想回去吗？\"\"是的，是的，\"他说，\"我想我们两个人都去，不是星期五去，主人不去。\"总而言之，没有我，他是绝不想回去的。我说，\"我去！星期五，我去那儿有什么事好做呢？\"他马上回答说：\"你可以做很多、很多的好事。你可以教我们这些野人，使他们成为善良的人，有头脑的人，和气的人。你可以教他们认识上帝，祈祷上帝，使他们过一种新的生活。\"\"唉，星期五，\"我说，\"你不知道你在说些什么啊？我自己也是一个无知的人啊！\"\"你行，你行，\"他说，\"你能把我教好，也就能把他们大家都教好。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\"不行，不行，星期五，\"我说，\"你一个人去吧，让我一个人留在这儿，仍像以前一样过日子吧。\"他听了我的话，又给弄糊涂了。他登时跑去把他日常佩带的那把斧头取来交给我。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"你给我斧头干什么？\"我问他。\"拿着它，杀了星期五吧！\"他说。\"我为什么要杀星期五呢？\"我又说。他马上回答说：\"你为什么要赶走星期五呢？拿斧头杀了星期五吧，不要赶他走。\"他说这几句话的时候，态度十分诚恳，眼睛里噙着眼泪，简言之，我一眼就看出，他对我真是一片真情，不改初衷。因此，我当时就对他说，只要他愿意跟我在一起，我再也不打发他走了。这话我后来还经常反反复复对他说了无数次。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 总之，从他全部的谈话看来，他对我的情意是坚定不移的，他绝对不愿离开我。他之所以想回到自己的家乡去，完全是出于他对自己部族的热爱，并希望我一起去对他们有好处。可是，我去了是否对他们会有用处，我自己却毫无把握，因此，我也不想为此而去对面的大陆。但是，我心里一直有一种强烈的愿望，希望我能从这儿逃走。这种愿望的根据，就是从他的谈话里得知那边有十七个有胡子的人。因此我马上就跟星期五一起，去找一颗可以砍伐的大树，拿它造条大一点的独木舟，以便驾着它到对面的大陆上去。这岛上到处是树木，足够用来造一支小小的船队，而且不仅仅是造一支独木舟的船队，而是可以造一支大船的船队。但我的主要目的，是要找一棵靠近水边的树。这样，造好之后就可以下水，避免我上次犯的错误。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后，星期五终于找到了一棵。用什么木料造船，他要比我内行得多。直到今天，我还说不上我们砍下来的那棵树叫什么名字，只知道样子像热带美洲的黄金木，或者是介于黄金木和中南美的红杉之间的树。那种红杉又称巴西木，因为这树的颜色和体味都与这两种树相似。星期五打算用火把这棵树烧空，造成一只独木舟，但我教他用工具来凿空。我把工具的使用方法告诉他之后，他立即很机灵地使用起来了。经过一个月左右的辛勤劳动，我们终于把船造好了，而且造得很好看。我教星期五怎样使用斧头后，我俩用斧头把独木舟的外壳砍削得完全像一条正规的小船。这以后，我们差不多又花了两星期的工夫，用大转木一寸一寸地推到水里去。一旦小船下水，我们发现它载上二十个人也绰绰有余。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 船下水后，虽然很大，可是星期五驾着它回旋自如，摇桨如飞，真是又灵巧又敏捷，使我大为惊异。于是我就问他，我们能不能坐这只船过海。\"是的，\"他说，\"我们能乘它过海，就是有风也不要紧。\"可是，我对船另有设计，星期五对此就一无所知了。我要给独木舟装上桅杆和船帆，还要配上锚和缆索。说到桅杆，那倒容易。我选了一根笔直的小杉树，这种树岛上到处都是，附近就找到了一棵。我让星期五把树砍下来，并教他削成桅杆的样子。可是船帆就有点伤脑筋了。我知道我藏了不少旧船帆，或者说有不少块旧帆布。但这些东西已放了二十六年了，也没有好好保管，因为以前我从来没有想到这些东西还会有什么用处。因此，我毫不怀疑，那些旧帆布早已烂掉了。事实上，大部分也确实烂掉了。可是，从这些烂帆布中间，我还是找到了两块帆布，看上去还不错，于是就动手用来做船帆。因为没有针，缝制起来就十分费力费时。花了不少力气，才勉强做成一块三角形的东西，样子丑陋不堪。那船帆的样子像我们英国的三角帆；用的时候，帆杆底下装一根横木，船篷上再装一根横木，就像我们大船的救生艇上装的帆一样。这种帆我是驾轻就熟了。因为我从巴巴里逃出来的那艘长艇上，装的就是这种帆。关于这件事，我在本书的第一部分已详细叙述过了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这最后一项工作，差不多花了我两个月左右的功夫，因为我想把制造和装备桅杆和船帆的工作做得尽可能完美无缺。此外，我还配上小小的桅索以帮助支撑桅杆。我在船头还做了个前帆，以便逆风时行船。尤其重要的是，我在船尾还装了一个舵，这样转换方向时就能驾御自如了。我造船的技术当然不能算高明，然而知道这些东西非常有用，而且是必不可少的，也就只好不辞辛劳，尽力去做了。在制造过程中，我当然几经试验和失败。如果把这些都计算在内，所花费的时间和力气，和造这条船本身相差无几。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 小船装备完毕，我就把使用帆和舵的方法教给星期五。他当然是个划船的好手，可是对使用帆和舵却一窍不通。他见我用手掌舵，驾着小舟在海上往来自如，又见那船帆随着船行方向的变化，一会儿这边灌满了风，一会儿那边灌满了风，不禁大为惊讶--简直惊讶得有点发呆了。可是，不久我就教会了他使用舵和帆，很快他就能熟练驾驶，成了一个出色的水手。只是罗盘这个东西，我却始终无法使他理解它的作用，好在这一带很少有云雾天气，白天总能看到海岸，晚上总能看到星星，所以也不大用得着罗盘。当然雨季情况就不同了，可是雨季一般谁都不出门，不要说出海航行了，就是在岛上走走也很少。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我流落到这个荒岛上，现在已经是第二十七个年头了，虽然最后三年似乎可以不算在里面。因为自从我有了星期五作伴，生活和以前大不相同了。我像过去一样，怀着感激的心情，度过了我上岛的纪念日。假如我过去有充分的理由感谢上帝的话，那现在就更如此了。因为现在我有更多的事实表明上帝对我的关怀，并且在我面前已呈现了极大的希望，我可以很快脱离大难，成功的可能性也极大。我心里已明确地感觉到，我脱离大难的日子为期不远，知道自己在这儿不会再呆上一年了。尽管如此，我仍像过去一样，照样耕作、挖土、种植、打围篱。另外就是采集和晒制葡萄干这些日常工作，一切都如常进行。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 雨季快到了，那时我们大部分时间都只好呆在家里，为此，我得先把我们的新船放置妥当。我把船移到从前卸木排的那条小河里，并趁涨潮时把它拖到岸上。我又叫星期五在那里挖了一个小小的船坞，宽度刚好能容得下小船，深度刚好在把水放进来后能把船浮起来。然后，趁退潮后，我们又在船坞口筑了一道坚固的堤坝挡住海水。这样，即使潮水上涨，也不会浸没小船。为了遮住雨水，我们又在船上面放了许多树枝，密密层层地堆了好几层，看上去像个茅草屋的屋顶。就这样，我们等候着十一月和十二月的到来：那是我准备冒险的日期。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 旱季快到了。随着天气日渐转好，我又忙着计划冒险的航行。我做的第一件事，就是储备起足够的粮食供航行之用，并打算在一两星期内掘开船坞，把船放到水里去。一天早晨，我正忙着这类事情，就叫星期五去海边抓个海鳖。我们每星期总要抓一两只回来，吃它的蛋和肉。星期五去了不久，就飞也似地跑回来，一纵身跳进外墙，他跑得飞快，仿佛脚不着地似的。我还来不及问他是怎么回事，他就大叫道：\"主人，主人，不好了，不好了！\"我说，\"什么事，星期五？\"他说， \\n\\n \\n\\n \"那边有一只，两只，三只独木船，一只，两只，三只！\"我听了他这种说法，还以为有六只独木船呢；后来又问了问，才知道只有三只。我说，\"不要害怕，星期五。\"我尽量给他壮胆。可是，我看到这可怜的家伙简直吓坏了，因为他首先想到的是，这些人是来找他的，并准会把他切成一块块吃掉。他一直浑身发抖，简直叫我对他毫无办法。我尽量安慰他，告诉他我也和他一样有危险，他们也会吃掉我。\"不过，\"我说，\"星期五，我们得下定决心与他们打一仗。你能打吗，星期五？ \\n\\n \\n\\n \"他说：\"我会放枪，可他们来的人太多。\"我说：\"那不要紧，我们的枪就是不打死他们，也会把他们吓跑。\"于是我又问他，如果我决心保卫他，他是否会保卫我，站在我一边，听我的吩咐。他说：\"你叫我死都行，主人。\"于是我拿了一大杯甘蔗酒让他喝下去。我甘蔗酒一向喝得很省，因此至今还剩下不少。等他把酒喝下去之后，我叫他去把我们平时经常携带的那两支鸟枪拿来，并装上大号的沙弹；那些沙弹有手枪子弹那么大。接着，我自己也取了四支短枪，每支枪里都装上两颗弹丸和五颗小子弹，又把两支手枪各装了一对子弹。此外，我又在腰间挂了那把没有刀鞘的大刀，给了星期五那把斧头。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 作好战斗准备，我就拿了望远镜跑到山坡上去看动静。从望远镜里，我一下子就看出，一共来了二十来个野人，带了三个俘虏。他们一共有三只独木舟。看样子，他们来这儿的目的是要拿这三个活人开一次胜利的宴会。这真是一种野蛮的宴会。但我也知道，对他们而言，这是习以为常的事情。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我还注意到，他们这次登陆的地点，不是上回星期五逃走的那地方，而是更靠近我那条小河的旁边。那一带海岸很低，并且有一片茂密的树林一直延伸到海边。看到他们登岸，想到这些畜生所要干的残忍的勾当，真令人打心底里感到憎恶。我怒气冲天，急忙跑下山来，告诉星期五，我决心把那些畜生斩尽杀绝，问他肯不肯站在我一边。这时星期五已消除了他恐惧的心情，又因为我给他喝了点甘蔗酒，精神也大大振奋。听了我的话，他大为高兴，并一再向我表示，就是我叫他死，他也情愿。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我当时真是义愤填膺。我先把早已装好弹药的武器分作两份。交给星期五一支手枪，叫他插在腰带上，又交给他三支长枪，让他背在肩上。我自己也拿了一支手枪和三支长枪。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我们就这样全副武装出发了。我又取了一小瓶甘蔗酒放在衣袋里，并把一大袋火药和子弹交给星期五拿着。我告诉星期五要听我指挥，命令他紧跟在我身后，没有我的命令，不得乱动，不得随便开枪，不得任意行动，也不许说话。就这样，我向右绕了一个圈子，差不多有一英里，以便越过小河，钻到树林里去。我要在他们发现我之前，就进入射击他们的距离，因为根据我用望远镜观察，这一点是很容易做到的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在前进过程中，我过去的一些想法又回到了我的心头，我的决心动摇了。这倒不是我怕他们人多，因为他们都是赤身露体，没有武器，我对他们可以占绝对优势，这是毫无疑问的，哪怕我一个人也不成问题。可是，我想到的是，我究竟有什么使命，什么理由，什么必要去杀人流血，要去袭击这些人呢？他们既没有伤害过我，也无意要伤害我。对我而言，他们是无辜的。至于他们那种野蛮的风俗，也只是他们自己的不幸，只能证明上帝有意让他们和他们那一带民族停留于愚昧和野蛮的状态。上帝并没有召唤我，要我去判决他们的行为，更没有要我去执行上帝的律法。任何时候，只要上帝认为适当，他满可以亲自执法，对他们全民族所犯的罪行，进行全民性的惩罚。即使那样，也与我无关。当然，对星期五来说，他倒是名正言顺的，因为他和这群人是公开的敌人，和他们处于交战状态。他要去攻击他们，那倒是合法的。但对我来说，情况就不同了。我一边往前走，一边被这些想法纠缠着。最后，我决定先站在他们附近，观察一下他们野蛮的宴会，然后根据上帝的指示，见机行事。我决定，若非获得上帝感召，决不去干涉他们。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这样决定之后，我就进入了树林。星期五紧随我身后，小心翼翼、悄然无声地往前走。我们一直走到树林的边缘，那儿离他们最近，中间只隔着一些树木，是树林边沿的一角。到了那里后，我就悄悄招呼星期五，指着林角上最靠外的一棵大树，要他隐蔽在那树后去观察一下，如果能看清楚他们的行动，就回来告诉我。他去了不大工夫，就回来对我说，从那儿他看得很清楚，他们正围着火堆吃一个俘虏的肉，另外还有一个俘虏，正躺在离他们不远的沙地上，手脚都捆绑着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 照他看来，他们接着就要杀他了。我听了他的话，不禁怒火中烧。他又告诉我，那躺着的俘虏不是他们部落的人，而是他曾经对我说过的坐小船到他们部落里去的那种有胡子的人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我听说是有胡子的白人，不禁大为惊讶。我走进那棵大树背后用望远镜一看，果然看见一个白人躺在海滩上，手脚被菖蒲草一类的东西捆绑着。同时，我还看出，他是个欧洲人，身上穿着衣服。这时，我看到在我前面还有一棵树，树前头有一小丛灌木，比我所在的地方离他们要近五十码。我只要绕一个小圈子，就可以走到那边，而且不会被他们发觉。只要一到那边，我和他们的距离就不到一半的射程了。这时，我已怒不可遏了，但还是强压心头的怒火，往回走了二十多步，来到一片矮树丛后面。靠着这片矮树丛的掩护，我一直走到那棵大树背后。那里有一片小小的高地，离那些野人大约有八十码远。我走上高地，把他们的一举一动看得清清楚楚。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 事情已发展到万分紧急的关头了，因为我看到有十九个野人挤在一起坐在地上，他们派出另外两个野人去宰杀那可怜的基督徒。看来，他们是要肢解他，一条胳膊一条腿地拿到火上去烤。我看到那两个野人这时已弯下腰，解着那白人脚上绑的东西。我转头对星期五说：\"听我的命令行动。\"星期五说他一定照办。我就说：\"好吧，星期五，你看我怎么办就怎么办，不要误事。\"于是，我把一支短枪和一支乌枪放在地下，星期五也跟着把他的一支鸟枪和一支短枪放在地下。我用剩下的一支短枪向那些野人瞄准，并叫星期五也用枪向他们瞄准。然后，我问星期五是否准备好了，他说：\"好了。\"我就说：\"开火！\"同时我自己也开了枪。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五的枪法比我强多了。射去的结果，他那边打死了两个，伤了三个。我这边只打死了一个，伤了两个。不必说，那群野人顿时吓得魂飞天外，那些未死未伤的全部从地上跳了起来，不知道往哪儿跑好，也不知道往哪儿看好，因为他们根本不知道这场灾祸是打哪儿来的。星期五一双眼睛紧盯着我，因为我吩咐过他，注意我的动作。我放完第一枪，马上把手里的短枪丢在地上，拿起一支鸟枪；星期五也照着做了。他看见我闭起一只眼瞄准，他也照样瞄准。我说：\"星期五，你预备好了吗？\"他说：\"好了。\"我就说：\"凭上帝的名义，开火！\"说着，我就向那群惊慌失措的畜生又开了一枪，星期五也开了枪。这一次，我们枪里装的都是小铁沙或手枪子弹，所以只打倒了两个，但受伤的却很多。只见他们像疯子似地乱跑乱叫，全身是血，大多数受了重伤；不久，其中有三个也倒下了，虽然还不曾完全死去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我把放过了的鸟枪放下来，把那支装好弹药的短枪拿在手里，对星期五说： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"现在，星期五，你跟我来！\"他果然勇敢地跟着我。于是我冲出树林，出现在那些野人面前。星期五紧跟在我后面，寸步不离。当我看到他们已经看得见我们时，我就拼命大声呐喊，同时叫星期五也跟着我大声呐喊。我一面呐喊，一面向前飞跑。其实我根本跑不快，因为身上的枪械实在太重了。我一路向那可怜的俘虏跑去。前面已经说过，那可怜的有胡子的人这时正躺在野人们所坐的地方和大海之间的沙滩上。那两个正要动手杀他的屠夫，在我们放头一枪时，早已吓得魂不附体。他们丢开了俘虏，拼命向海边跑去，跳上了一只独木船。这时，那群野人中也有三个向同一方面逃跑。我回头吩咐星期五，要他追过去向他们开火。他立即明白了我的意思。向前跑了约四十码，跑到离他们较近的地方，就向那批野人开枪。起初我以为他把他们通通打死了，因为我看到他们一下子都倒在船里了。可是不久我又看到他们中有两个人很快又坐起来。尽管这样，他也打死了两个，打伤了一个；那个受伤的倒在船舱里，仿佛死了一般。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 当星期五向那批逃到独木舟上的野人开火时，我拔出刀子，把那可怜的家伙身上捆着的菖蒲草割断，把他的手脚松了绑，然后把他从地上扶起来。我用葡萄牙话问他是什么人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他用拉丁话回答说：\"基督徒。\"他已疲惫不堪，浑身瘫软，几乎站都站不起来，甚至连话都说不出来。我从口袋里拿出那瓶酒，作手势叫他喝一点。他马上喝了几口。我又给了他一块面包，他也吃了下去。于是我又问他是哪个国家的人，他说：\"西班牙人。\"这时，他精神已稍稍有些恢复，便做出各种手势，表示他对我救他的命如何如何感激。\"先生，\"我把我所能讲的西班牙语通通搬了出来，\"这些我们回头再说吧。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在打仗要紧。要是你还有点力气的话，就拿上这支手枪和这把刀杀过去吧！ \\n\\n \\n\\n \"他马上把武器接过去，表示十分感激。他手里一拿到武器，就仿佛滋生了新的力量，顿时就向他的仇人们扑过去，一下子就砍倒了两个，并把他们剁成肉泥。因为，事实上，我们所进行的这场攻击实在太出乎他们的意料之外了，这班可怜的家伙给我们的枪声吓得东倒西歪，连怎样逃跑都不知道，就只好拿他们的血肉之躯来抵挡我们的枪弹。星期五在小船上打死打伤的那五个，情形也一样。他们中有三个确实是受了伤倒下的，另外两个却是吓昏了倒下的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时候，我手上仍拿着一支枪，但我没有开枪，因为我已把手枪和腰刀给了那西班牙人，手里得留一支装好弹药的枪，以防万一。我把星期五叫过来，吩咐他赶快跑到我们第一次放枪的那棵大树边，把那几支枪拿过来。他一下子就取回来了。于是我把自己的短枪交给他，自己坐下来给所有的枪再次装上弹药，并告诉他需要用枪时随时可来龋正当我在装弹药时，忽然发现那个西班牙人正和一个野人扭作一团，打得不可开交。那个野人手里拿着一把木头刀跟西班牙人拼杀。这种木头刀，正是他们刚才准备用来杀他的那种武器，要不是我及时出来阻止，早就把他杀死了。那西班牙人虽然身体虚弱，却异常勇猛。我看到他时，已和那野人恶战了好一会了，并且在那野人头上砍了两个大口子。可是，那野人强壮无比，威武有力，只见他向前猛地一扑，就把西班牙人撂倒在地上，并伸手去夺西班牙人手中的刀。那西班牙人被他压在底下，急中生智，连忙松开手中的刀，从腰间拔出手枪，没等我来得及跑过去帮忙，他早已对准那野人，一枪结果了敌人的性命。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五趁这时没人管他，就手里只拿了一把斧头，向那些望风而逃的野人追去。他先用斧头把刚才受伤倒下的三个野人结果了性命，然后把他能追赶得上的野人杀个精光，一个不留。这时候，那西班牙人跑过来向我要枪，我就给了他一支鸟枪。他拿着鸟枪，追上了两个野人，把他们都打伤了，但因为他已没有力气再跑了，那两个受伤的野人就逃到树林里去了。这时星期五又追到树林里，砍死了一个；另一个却异常敏捷，虽然受了伤，还是跳到海里，拼力向留在独木舟上的那两个野人游去。这三个人，连同一个受了伤而生死不明的野人，从我们手中逃出去了，二十一名中其余的十七人，都被我们打死了。全部战果统计如下：被我们从树后第一枪打死的，三名；第二枪打死的，二名；被星期五打死在船上的，二名；受伤后被星期五砍死的，二名；在树林中被星期五砍死的，一名；被西班牙人杀死的，三名；在各处因伤毙命或被星期五追杀而死的，四名；在小船里逃生的，共四名；其中一名虽没有死，也受了伤。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 以上共计二十一名。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 那几个逃上独木舟的野人，拼力划着船，想逃出我们的射程。虽然星期五向他们开了两三枪，可我没看到他打中任何人。星期五希望用他们的独木船去追杀他们。说实在的，放这几个野人逃走，我心里也很有顾虑。因为若把消息带回本部落，说不定他们会坐上两三百只独木船卷土重来，那时，他们将以多胜少，把我们通通杀光吃掉。所以我也同意星期五到海上去追他们。我立刻跑向一只独木船跳了上去，并叫星期五也一起上来。可是，我一跳上独木舟，就发现船上还躺着一个俘虏，真是大大出乎我的意外，那俘虏也像那西班牙人一样，手脚都被捆绑着，等着被杀了吃掉。因为他无法抬头看看船外边的情况，所以不知道究竟发生了什么事，人已吓得半死；再加上脖子和脚给绑得太紧，而且也绑得太久，所以只剩一口气了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我立刻把捆在他身上的菖浦之类的东西割断，想把他扶起来，但是他连说话的力气都没有了，更不要说站起来了。他只是一个劲儿地哼哼着，样子可怜极了，因为他还以为给他松绑是准备拿他开刀呢。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 星期五一上船，我就叫星期五跟他讲话，告诉他已经遇救了。同时，我又把酒瓶掏出来，叫星期五给这可怜的野人喝两口。那野人喝了酒，又听见自己已经获救，不觉精神为之一振，居然马上坐了起来。不料，星期五一听见他说话，把他的脸一看，立刻又是吻他，又是拥抱他，又是大哭大笑，又是大喊大叫；接着又是一个劲儿地乱跳狂舞，大声唱歌；然后又是大哭大嚎，又是扭自己的两手，打自己的脸和头，继而又是高声大唱，又是乱跳狂舞，活像个疯子。他那样子，任何人看了都要感动得流泪。他这样发疯似地闹了好半天，我才使得他开口，让他告诉我究竟是怎么回事。他稍稍镇静了一会，才告诉我，这是他父亲。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我看见这可怜的野人见到他父亲，见到他父亲已绝处逢生，竟流露出如此无限的孝心，简直欣喜若狂，我内心所受感动实难言表。不仅如此，在他们父子相逢之后，他那种一往情深，不能自禁的样子，我更是无法形容。只见他一会儿跳上小船，一会儿又跳下来，这样上上下下，不知折腾了多少趟。每次一上船，他总要坐到他父亲身边，袒开胸膛，把父亲的头紧紧抱在胸口，一抱就是半个钟头。他这样做是为了使父亲感到舒服些。然后，他又捧住他父亲被绑得麻木和僵硬的手或脚，不停地搓擦。我见他这样做，就把酒瓶里的甘蔗酒倒了一些出来给他，叫他用酒来按摩，这样效果果然好多了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 发生了这件事，我们就没能再去追那条独木舟上的野人了。他们这时也已划得很远很远，差不多连影子都看不见了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 事实上，我们没有去追击，倒是我们的运气。因为不到两小时，海上就刮起了大风，我们估计那些逃跑的野人还没有走完四分之一的路程。大风刮了整整一夜，还是西北风，对他们来说正是逆风，所以我估计，他们的船就是不翻也到不了自己的海岸。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在再回过头来谈谈星期五吧。他这时正围着他父亲忙得不可开交，使我不忍心差他去做什么事。等我觉得他可以稍稍离开一会时才把他叫过来。他过来了，又是跳，又是笑，一副兴高采烈的样子。我问他有没有给他父亲吃面包。他摇头说，\"没有，我这丑狗头把面包吃光了。\"于是我从自己特意带出来的一只小袋袋里掏出一块面包给他，又给了他一点酒，叫他自己喝。可是，他连尝都不肯尝一下，一古脑儿拿到他父亲那里去了。我衣袋里还有两三串葡萄干，我给了他一把，叫他也拿给他父亲吃。他把这把葡萄干送给他父亲之后，马上又跳出小船，像着了魔似地向远处跑去，而且跑得飞快。他真是我生气见到过的唯一的飞毛腿，一下子就跑得无影无踪了。尽管我对着他大声叫喊，他还是头也不回地一个劲往前跑。不到一刻钟工夫，他跑回来了，不过速度已经没有去的时候那么快了。当他走近时，我才发现原来他手里还拿着东西，所以跑得不那么快了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他走到我面前我才知道，原来他是跑回家去取一只泥罐子，替他父亲弄了些淡水来，并且又带来了两块面包。他把面包交给我，把水送给他父亲。我这时也感到很渴了，就顺便喝了一口。他父亲喝了点水后，精神好多了，比我给他喝酒还有效，因为他确实渴得快要昏过去了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他父亲喝完水，我便把星期五叫过来，问他罐子里还有没有水。他说：\"有。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"我就叫他把水给那西班牙人去喝，因为他也和星期五的父亲一样快渴死了。我又叫他把他带来的面包也送一块给那西班牙人吃。这时，那西班牙人已一点也没有力气了，正躺在一棵树底下的绿草地上休息。他的手脚因刚刚被绑得太紧，现在又肿又硬。我看到星期五把水给他送过去，他就坐起来喝水，并把面包接了过去，开始吃起面包来了。我走到他面前，又给了他一把葡萄干。他抬起头来望着我，脸上露出无限感激的样子。可是他身子实在太虚弱了，尽管他在与野人战斗时奋力气搏，但现在却连站都站不起来。他试了两三回，可是脚踝肿胀得厉害，痛得根本站不祝我叫他坐下别动，要星期五替他搓脚踝，就像他替父亲搓擦手脚那样。我还让他用甘蔗酒擦洗擦洗。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我发现，星期五真是个心地诚挚的孝子。他一边为西班牙人搓擦，一边频频回头看他的父亲是否还坐在原来的地方。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 有一次，他忽然发觉他父亲不见了，就立即跳起来，一句话也不说，飞跑到他父亲那边，他跑得飞快，简直脚不点地。他过去一看，原来他父亲为了舒舒手脚的筋骨，躺了下去。他这才放心，又赶紧回来。这时我对西班牙人说，让星期五扶他走到小船上去，然后坐船到我们的住所，这样我可照顾他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不料星期五力大无比，一下子把那西班牙人背在身上，向小船那边走去。到了船边，星期五把西班牙人朝里轻轻放到船沿上，又把他拖起来往里一挪，安置在他父亲身旁。然后，星期五立即跳出小船，把船推到水里，划着它沿岸驶去。尽管这时风已刮得很大了，可他划得比我走还快。他把他俩安全地载到那条小河里，让他们在船里等着，他自己又马上翻身回来，去取海边的另一只独木舟。我在半路遇上他，问他上哪儿去。他说：\"去取那只小船。\"说完又一阵风似地跑了，比谁都跑得快，甚至可以说比马都跑得快。我从陆路刚走到小河边，他就已经把另一只独木船划进河里了。他先把我渡过小河，又去帮助我们两位新来的客人下了船。可是他俩都已无法走动，把可怜的星期五弄得一筹莫展。
