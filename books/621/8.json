{"id":45229,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a Day of great Fatigue to me, I slept very sound, \u0027till I was something surpriz\u0027d with the Noise of a Gun; and presently starting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name of Governour, Governour, and presently I knew the Captain\u0027s Voice, when climbing up to the Top of the Hill, there he stood, and pointing to the Ship, he embrac\u0027d me in Arms, My dear Friend and Deliverer, says he, there\u0027s your Ship, for she is all yours, and so are we and all that belong to her. I cast my Eyes to the Ship, and there she rode within little more than half a Mile of the Shore; for they had weighed for as soon as they were Masters of her; and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an Anchor just against the Mouth of the little Creek; and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought the Pinnace in near the Place where I at first landed my Rafts, and so landed just at my Door. I was at first ready to sink down with the Surprize. For I saw my Deliverance indeed visibly put into my Hands, all things easy, and a large Ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one Word; but as he had taken me in his Arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the Ground. \n \n He perceived the Surprize, and immediately pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on Purpose for me; after I had drank it, I sat down upon the Ground; and though it brought me to my self, yet it was a good while before I could speak a Word to him. \n \n All this while the poor Man was in as great an Extasy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was; and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to compose me and bring me to my self; but such was the Flood of Joy in my Breast, that it put all my Spirits into Confusion, at last it broke out into Tears, and in a little while after, I recovered my Speech. \n \n Then I took my Turn, and embrac\u0027d him as my Deliverer; and we rejoyc\u0027d together. I told him, I look upon him as a Man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole Transaction seemed to be a Chain of Wonders; that such things as these were the Testimonies we had of a secret Hand of Providence governing the World, and an Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could search into the remotest Corner of the World, and send Help to the Miserable whenever he pleased. \n \n I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankfulness to Heaven, and what Heart could forbear to bless him, who had not only in a miraculous Manner provided for one in such a Wilderness, and in such a desolate Condition, but from whom every Deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed. \n \n When we had talk\u0027d a while, the Captain told me, he had brought me some little Refreshment, such as the Ship afforded, and such as the Wretches that had been so long his Master had not plunder\u0027d him of: Upon this he call\u0027d aloud to the Boat, and bid his Men bring the things ashore that were for the Governour; and indeed it was a Present, as if I had been one not that was to be carry\u0027d away along with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the Island still, and they were to go without me. \n \n First he had brought me a Case of Bottles full of excellent Cordial Waters, six large Bottles of Madera Wine; the Bottles held two Quarts a-piece; two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good Pieces of the Ship\u0027s Beef, and six Pieces of Pork, with a Bag of Pease, and about a hundred Weight of Bisket. \n \n He brought me also a Box of Sugar, a Box of Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of Lime-Juice, and Abundance of other things: But besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six clean new Shirts, six very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stockings, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his own, which had been worn but very little: In a Word, he cloathed me from Head to Foot. \n \n It was a very kind and agreeable Present, as any one may imagine to one in my Circumstances: But never was any thing in the World of that Kind so unpleasant, awkard, and uneasy, as it was to me to wear such Cloaths at their first putting on. \n \n After these Ceremonies past, and after all his good things were brought into my little Apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the Prisoners we had; for it was worth considering, whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, especially two of them, who we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last Degree; and the Captain said, he knew they were such Rogues, that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in Irons, as Malefactors to be delivered over to Justice at the first English Colony he could come at; and I found that the Captain himself was very anxious about it. \n \n Upon this, I told him, that if he desir\u0027d it, I durst undertake to bring the two Men he spoke of, to make it their own Request that he should leave them upon the Island: I should be very glad of that, says the Captain, with all my Heart. \n \n Well, says I, I will send for them up, and talk with them for you; so I caused Friday and the two Hostages, for they were now discharg\u0027d, their Comrades having perform\u0027d their Promise; I say, I caused them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five Men pinion\u0027d, as they were, to the Bower, and keep them there \u0027till I came. \n \n After some time, I came thither dress\u0027d in my new Habit, and now I was call\u0027d Governour again; being all met, and the Captain with me, I caused the Men to be brought before me, and I told them, I had had a full Account of their villanous Behaviour to the Captain, and how they had run away with the Ship, and were preparing to commit farther Robberies, but that Providence had ensnar\u0027d them in their own Ways, and that they were fallen into the Pit which they had digged for others. \n \n I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship had been seiz\u0027d, that she lay now in the Road; and they might see by and by, that their new Captain had receiv\u0027d the Reward of his Villany; for that they might see him hanging at the Yard-Arm. \n \n That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say, why I should not execute them as Pirates taken in the Fact, as by my Commission they could not doubt I had Authority to do. \n \n One of them answer\u0027d in the Name of the rest, That they had nothing to say but this, That when they were taken, the Captain promis\u0027d them their Lives, and they humbly implor\u0027d my Mercy; But I told them, I knew not what Mercy to shew them; for as for my self, I had resolv\u0027d to quit the Island with all my Men, and had taken Passage with the Captain to go for England: And as for the Captain, he could not carry them to England, other than as Prisoners in Irons to be try\u0027d for Mutiny, and running away with the Ship; the Consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the Gallows; so that I could not tell which was best for them, unless they had a Mind to take their Fate in the Island; if they desir\u0027d, that I did not care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had some Inclination to give them their Lives, if they thought they could shift on Shore. \n \n They seem\u0027d very thankful for it, said they would much rather venture to stay there, than to be carry\u0027d to England to be hang\u0027d; so I left it on that Issue. \n \n However, the Captain seem\u0027d to make some Difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there: Upon this I seem\u0027d a little angry with the Captain, and told him, That they were my Prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them so much Favour, I would be as good as my Word; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at Liberty, as I found them; and if he did not like it, he might take them again if he could catch them. \n \n Upon this they appear\u0027d very thankful, and I accordingly set them at Liberty, and bad them retire into the Woods to the Place whence they came, and I would leave them some Fire Arms, some Ammunition, and some Directions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. \n \n Upon this I prepar\u0027d to go on Board the Ship, but told the Captain, that I would stay that Night to prepare my things, and desir\u0027d him to go on Board in the mean time, and keep all right in the Ship, and send the Boat on Shore the next Day for me; ordering him in the mean time to cause the new Captain who was kill\u0027d, to be hang\u0027d at the Yard-Arm that these Men might see him. \n \n When the Captain was gone, I sent for the Men up to me to my Apartment, and entred seriously into Discourse with them of their Circumstances, I told them, I thought they had made a right Choice; that if the Captain carry\u0027d them away, they would certainly be hang\u0027d. I shewed them the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-Arm of the Ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect. \n \n When they had all declar\u0027d their Willingness to stay, I then told them, I would let them into the Story of my living there, and put them into the Way of making it easy to them: Accordingly I gave them the whole History of the Place, and of my coming to it; shew\u0027d them my Fortifications, the Way I made my Bread, planted my Corn, cured my Grapes; and in a Word, all that was necessary to make them easy: I told them the Story also of the sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for whom I left a Letter, and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves. \n \n I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muskets, three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had above a Barrel and half of Powder left; for after the first Year or two, I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a Description of the Way I manag\u0027d the Goats, and Directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both Butter and Cheese. \n \n In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own Story; and I told them, I would prevail with the Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder more, and some Garden-Seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of; also I gave them the Bag of Pease which the Captain had brought me to eat, and bad them be sure to sow and encrease them. \n \n Having done all this, I left them the next Day, and went an Board the Ship: We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that Night: The next Morning early, two of the five Men came swimming to the Ship\u0027s Side, and making a most lamentable Complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the Ship, for God\u0027s Sake, for they should be murthered, and begg\u0027d the Captain to take them on Board, tho\u0027 he hang\u0027d them immediately. \n \n Upon this the Captain pretended to have no Power without me; But after some Difficulty, and after their solemn Promises off Amendment, they were taken on Board, and were some time after soundly whipp\u0027d and pickl\u0027d; after which, they prov\u0027d very honest and quiet Fellows. \n \n Some time after this, the Boat was order\u0027d on Shore, the Tide being up, with the things promised to the Men, to which the Captain at my Intercession caused their Chests and Cloaths to be added, which they took, and were very thankful for; I also encourag\u0027d them, by telling them, that if it lay in my Way to send any Vessel to take them in, I would not forget them. \n \n When I took leave of this Island, I carry\u0027d on board for Reliques, the great Goat\u0027s-Skin-Cap I had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot; also I forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention\u0027d, which had lain by me so long useless, that it was grown rusty, or tarnish\u0027d, and could hardly pass for Silver, till it had been a little rubb\u0027d, and handled; as also the Money I found in the Wreck of the Spanish Ship. \n \n And thus I left the Island, the Nineteenth of December, as I found by the Ship\u0027s Account, in the Year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and twenty Years, two Months, and 19 Days; being deliver\u0027d from this second Captivity, the same Day of the Month, that I first made my Escape in the Barco-Longo, from among the Moors of Sallee. \n \n In this Vessel, after a long Voyage, I arriv\u0027d in England, the Eleventh of June, in the Year 1687, having been thirty and five Years absent. \n \n When I came to England, I was as perfect a Stranger to all the World, as if I had never been known there. My Benefactor and faithful Steward, who I had left in Trust with my Money, was alive; but had had great Misfortunes in the World; was become a Widow the second Time, and very low in the World: I made her easy as to what she ow\u0027d me, assuring her, I would give her no Trouble; but on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care and Faithfulness to me, I reliev\u0027d her as my little Stock would afford, which at that Time would indeed allow me to do but little for her; abut I assur\u0027d her, I would never forget her former Kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be observ\u0027d in its Place. \n \n I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Family extinct, except that I found two Sisters, and two of the Children of one of my Brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no Provision made for me; so that in a Word, I found nothing to relieve, or assist me; and that little Money I had, would not do much for me, as to settling in the World. \n \n I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and this was, That the Master of the Ship, who I had so happily deliver\u0027d, and by the same Means sav\u0027d the Ship and Cargo, having given a very handsome Account to the Owners, of the Manner how I had sav\u0027d the Lives of the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet them, and some other Merchants concern\u0027d, and altogether made me a very handsome Compliment upon the Subject, and a Present of almost two hundred Pounds Sterling. \n \n But after making several Reflections upon the Circumstances of my Life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in the World, I resolv\u0027d to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some Information of the State of my Plantation in the Brasils, and of what was become of my Partner, who I had reason to suppose had some Years now given me Over for dead. \n \n With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon, where I arriv\u0027d in April following; my Man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these Ramblings, and proving a most faithful Servant upon all Occasions. \n \n When I came to Lisbon, I found out by Enquiry, and to my particular Satisfaction, my old Friend the Captain of the Ship, who first took me up at Sea, off of the Shore of Africk: He was now grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put his Son, who was far from a young Man, into his Ship; and who still used the Brasil Trade. The old Man did not know me, and indeed, I hardly knew him; but I soon brought him to my Remembrance, and as soon brought my self to his Remembrance, when I told him who I was. \n \n After some passionate Expressions of the old Acquaintance, I enquir\u0027d, you may be sure, after my Plantation and my Partner: The old Man told me he had not been in the Brasils for about nine Years; but that he could assure me, that when he came away, my Partner was living, but the Trustees, who I had join\u0027d with him to take Cognizance of my Part, were both dead; that however, he believ\u0027d that I would have a very good Account of the Improvement of the Plantation; for that upon the general Belief of my being cast away, and drown\u0027d, my Trustees had given in the Account of the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the Procurator Fiscal, who had appropriated it, in Case I never came to claim it; one Third to the King, and two Thirds to the Monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor, and for the Conversion of the Indians to the Catholick Faith; but that if I appear\u0027d, or any one for me, to claim the Inheritance, it should be restor\u0027d; only that the Improvement, or Annual Production, being distributed to charitable Uses, could not be restor\u0027d; but he assur\u0027d me, that the Steward of the King\u0027s Revenue (from Lands) and the Proviedore, or Steward of the Monastery, had taken great Care all along, that the Incumbent, that is to say my Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account of the Produce, of which they receiv\u0027d duly my Moiety. \n \n I ask\u0027d him if he knew to what height of Improvement he had brought the Plantation? And, Whether he thought it might be worth looking after? Or, Whether on my going thither, I should meet with no Obstruction to my Possessing my just Right in the Moiety? \n \n He told me, he could not tell exactly, to what Degree the Plantation was improv\u0027d; but this he knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding Rich upon the enjoying but one half of it; and that to the best of his Remembrance, he had heard, that the King\u0027s Third of my Part, which was it seems granted away to some other Monastery, or Religious House, amounted to above two hundred Moidores a Year; that as to my being restor\u0027d to a quiet Possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my Partner being alive to witness my Title, and my Name being also enrolled in the Register of the Country; also he told me, That the Survivors of my two Trustees, were very fair honest People, and very Wealthy; and he believ\u0027d I would not only have their Assistance for putting me in Possession, but would find a very considerable Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account; being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers held the Trust, and before it was given up as above, which as he remember\u0027d, was for about twelve Years. \n \n I shew\u0027d my self a little concern\u0027d, and uneasy at this Account, and enquir\u0027d of the old Captain, How it came to pass, that the Trustees should thus dispose my Effects, when he knew that I had made my Will, and had made him, the Portuguese Captain, my universal Heir, \u0026 c. \n \n He told me, that was true; but that as there was no Proof of my being dead, he could not act as Executor, until some certain Account should come of my Death, and that besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it was true he had registred my Will, and put in his Claim; and could he have given any Account of my being dead or alive, he would have acted by Procuration, and taken Possession of the Ingenio, so they call\u0027d the Sugar-House, and had\u0027 given his Son, who was now at the Brasils, Order to do it. \n \n But, says the old Man, I have one Piece of News to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest, and that is, That believing you were lost, and all the World believing so also, your Partner and Trustees did offer to accompt to me in your Name, for six or eight of the first Years of Profits, which I receiv\u0027d; but there being at that time, says he, great Disbursements for encreasing the Works, building an Ingenio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced: However, says she old Man, I shall give you a true Account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of it. \n \n After a few Days farther Conference with this ancient Friend, he brought me an Account of the six first Years Income of my Plantation, sign\u0027d by my Partner and the Merchants Trustees, being always deliver\u0027d in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll, and Sugar in Chests, besides Rum, Molossus, \u0026 c. which is the Consequence of a Sugar Work; and I found by this Account, that every Year the Income considerably encreased; but as above, the Disbursement being large, the Sum at first was small: However, the old Man let me see, that he was Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, besides 60 Chests of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of Tobacco which were lost in his Ship; he having been Ship-wreck\u0027d coming Home to Lisbon about 11 Years after my leaving the Place. \n \n The good Man then began to complain of his Misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make Use of my Money to recover his Losses, and buy him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old Friend, says he, you shall not want a Supply in your Necessity; and as soon as my Son returns, you shall be fully satisfy\u0027d. \n \n Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives me 160 Portugal Moidores in Gold; and giving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, which his Son was gone to the Brasils in, of which he was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another, he puts them both into my Hands for Security of the rest. \n \n I was too much mov\u0027d with the Honesty and Kindness of the poor Man, to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at Sea, and how generously he had used me on all Occasions, and particularly, how sincere a Friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain Weeping at what he said to me: Therefore, first I asked him, if his Circumstances admitted him to spare so much Money at that time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me, he could not say but it might straiten him a little; but however it was my Money, and I might want it more than he. \n \n Every thing the good Man said was full of Affection, and I could hardly refrain from Tears while he spoke: In short, I took 100 of the Moidores, and call\u0027d for a Pen and Ink to give him a Receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, and told him, If ever I had Possession of the Plantation, I would return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards did; and that as to the Bill of Sale of his Part in his Son\u0027s Ship, I would not take it by any Means; but that if I wanted the Money, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a Penny more from him. \n \n When this was pass\u0027d, the old Man began to ask me, If he should put me into a Method to make my Claim to my Plantation? I told him, I thought to go over to it my self: He said, I might do so if I pleas\u0027d; but that if I did not, there were Ways enough to secure my Right, and immediately to appropriate the Profits to my Use; and as there were Ships in the River of Lisbon, just ready to go away to Brasil, he made me enter my Name in a Publick Register, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath that I was alive, and that I was the same Person who took up the Land for the Planting the said Plantation at first. \n \n This being regularly attested by a Notary, and a Procuration affix\u0027d, he directed me to send it with a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Acquaintance at the Place, and then propos\u0027d my staying with him till an Account came of the Return. \n \n Never any Thing was more honourable, than the Proceedings upon this Procuration; for in less than seven Months, I receiv\u0027d a large Packet from the Survivors of my Trustees the Merchants, for whose Account I went to Sea, in which were the following particular Letters and Papers enclos\u0027d. \n \n First, There was the Account Current of the Produce of my Farms or Plantation, from the Year when their Fathers had ballanc\u0027d with my old Portugal Captain, being for six Years; the Ballance appear\u0027d to be 1174 Moidores in my Favour. \n \n Secondly, There was the Account of four Years more while they kept the Effects in their Hands, before the Government claim\u0027d the Administration, as being the Effects of a Person not to be found, which they call\u0027d Civil \n \n Death; and the Ballance of this, the Value of the Plantation encreasing, amounted to [38,892] Cruisadoes, which made 3241 Moidores. \n \n Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Augustin\u0027s Account, who had receiv\u0027d the Profits for above fourteen Years; but not being to account for what was dispos\u0027d to the Hospital, very honestly declar\u0027d he had 872 Moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my Account; as to the King\u0027s Part, that refunded nothing. \n \n There was a Letter of my Partner\u0027s, congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an Account how the Estate was improv\u0027d, and what it produced a Year, with a Particular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it contained; how planted, how many Slaves there were upon it, and making two and twenty Crosses for Blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take Possession of my own; and in the mean time to give him Orders to whom he should deliver my Effects, if I did not come my self; concluding with a hearty Tender of his Friendship, and that of his Family, and sent me, as a Present, seven fine Leopard\u0027s Skins, which he had it seems received from Africa, by some other Ship which he had sent thither, and who it seems had made a better Voyage than I: He sent me also five Chests of excellent Sweet-meats, and an hundred Pieces of Gold uncoin\u0027d, not quite so large as Moidores. \n \n By the same Fleet, my two Merchant Trustees shipp\u0027d me 1 200 Chests of Sugar, 800 Rolls of Tobacco, and the rest of the whole Accompt in Gold. \n \n I might well say, now indeed, That the latter End of Job was better than the Beginning. It is impossible to express pere the Flutterings of my very Heart, when I look\u0027d over these Letters, and especially when I found all my Wealth about me; for as the Brasil Ships come all in Fleets, the same Ships which brought my Letters, brought my Goods; and the Effects were safe in the River before the Letters came to my Hand. In a Word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the old Man run and fetch\u0027d me a Cordial, I believe the sudden Surprize of Joy had overset Nature, and I had dy\u0027d upon the Spot. \n \n Nay after that, I continu\u0027d very ill, and was so some Hours, \u0027till a Physician being sent for, and something of the real Cause of my illness being known, he order\u0027d me to be let Blood; after which, I had Relief, and grew well: But I verily believe, if it had not been eas\u0027d by a Vent given in that Manner, to the Spirits, I should have dy\u0027d. \n \n I was now Master, all on a Sudden, of above 5000 l. Sterling in Money, and had an Estate, as I might well call it, in the Brasils, of above a thousand Pounds a Year, as sure as an Estate of Lands in England: And in a Word, I was in a Condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose my self, for the Enjoyment of it. \n \n The first thing I did, was to recompense my original Benefactor, my good old Captain, who had been first charitable to me in my Distress, kind to me in my Beginning, and honest to me at the End: I shew\u0027d him all that was sent me, I told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was Owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred fold: So I first return\u0027d to him the hundred Moidores I had receiv\u0027d of him, then I sent for a Notary, and caused him to draw up a general Release or Discharge for the 470 Moidores, which he had acknowledg\u0027d he ow\u0027d me in the fullest and firmest Manner possible; after which, I caused a Procuration to be drawn, impowering him to be my Receiver of the annual Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Partner to accompt to him, and make the Returns by the usual Fleets to him in my Name; and a Clause in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effects, and 50 Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for his Life: And thus I requited my old Man. \n \n I was now to consider which Way to steer my Course next, and what to do with the Estate that Providence had thus put into my Hands; and indeed I had more Care upon my Head now, than I had in my silent State of Life in the Island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted: Whereas I had now a great Charge upon me, and my Business was how to secure it. I had ne\u0027er a Cave now to hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye without Lock or Key, \u0027till it grew mouldy and tarnish\u0027d before any Body would meddle with it: On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or who to trust with it. My old Patron, the Captain, indeed was honest, and that was the only Refuge I had. \n \n In the next Place, my Interest in the Brasils seem\u0027d to summon me thither, but now I could not tell, how to think of going thither, \u0027till I had settled my Affairs, and left my Effects in some safe Hands behind me. At first I thought of my old Friend the Widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in Years, and but poor, and for ought I knew, might be in Debt; so that in a Word, I had no Way but to go back to England my self, and take my Effects with me. \n \n It was some Months however before I resolved upon this; and therefore, as I had rewarded the old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction, who had been my former Benefactor, so I began to think of my poor Widow, whose Husband had been my first Benefactor, and she, while it was in her Power, my faithful Steward and Instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write to his Correspondent in London, not only to pay a Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Money, an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her she should, if I liv\u0027d, have a further Supply: At the same time I sent my two Sisters in the Country, each of them an Hundred Pounds, they being, though not in Want, yet not in very good Circumstances; one having been marry\u0027d, and left a Widow; and the other having a Husband not so kind to her as he should be. \n \n But among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durst commit the Gross of my Stock, that I might go away to the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly perplex\u0027d me. \n \n I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brasils, and have settled my self there; for I was, as it were, naturaliz\u0027d to the Place; but I had some little Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall say more presently. However, it was not Religion that kept me rom going there for the present; and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of the Religion of the Country, all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; only that now and then having of late thought more of it, (than formerly) when I began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret my having profess\u0027d my self a Papist, and thought it might not be the best Religion to die with. \n \n But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my Effects behind me; so I resolv\u0027d at last to go to England with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some Acquaintance, or find some Relations that would be faithful to me; and according I prepar\u0027d to go for England with all my Wealth. \n \n In order to prepare things for my going Home, I first, the Brasil Fleet being just going away, resolved to give Answers suitable to the just and faithful Account of things I had from thence; and first to the Prior of St. Augustine I wrote a Letter full of Thanks for their just Dealings, and the Offer of the 872 Moidores, which was indisposed of, which I desir\u0027d might be given 500 to the Monastery, and 372 to the Poor, as the Prior should direct, desiring the good Padres Prayers for me, and the like. \n \n I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two Trustees, with all the Acknowledgment that so much Justice and Honesty call\u0027d for; as for sending them any Present, they were far above having any Occasion of it. \n \n Lastly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging his Industry in the Improving the Plantation, and his Integrity in encreasing the Stock of the Works, giving him Instructions for his future Government of my Part, according to the Powers I had left with my old Patron, to whom I desir\u0027d him to send whatever became due to me, \u0027till he should hear me more particularly; assuring him that it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but to settle my self there for the Remainder of my Life: To this I added a very handsom Present of some Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters, for such the Captain\u0027s Son inform\u0027d me he had; with two Pieces of fine English broad Cloath, the best I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays, and some Flanders Lace of a good Value. \n \n Having thus settled my Affairs, sold my Cargoe, and turn\u0027d all my Effects into good Bills of Exchange, my next Difficulty was, which Way to go to England: I had been accustom\u0027d enough to the Sea, and yet I had a strange Aversion to going to England by Sea at that time; and though I could give no Reason for it, yet the Difficulty encreas\u0027d upon me so much, that though I had once shipp\u0027d my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter\u0027d my Mind, and that not once, but two or three times. \n \n It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea, and this might be some of the Reason: But let no Man slight the strong Impulses of his own Thoughts in Cases of such Moment: Two of the Ships which I had singl\u0027d out to go in, I mean, more particularly singl\u0027d out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to put my things on Board, and in the other to have agreed with the Captain; I say, two of these Ships miscarry\u0027d, viz. One was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start near Torbay, and all the People drown\u0027d except three; so that in either of those Vessels I had been made miserable; and in which most, it was hard to say. \n \n Having been thus harass\u0027d in my Thoughts, my old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, press\u0027d me earnestly not to go by Sea, but either to go by Land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochell, from whence it was but an easy and safe Journey by Land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the Way by Land thro\u0027 France. \n \n In a Word, I was so prepossess\u0027d against my going by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolv\u0027d to travel all the Way by Land; which as I was not in Haste, and did not value the Charge, was by much the pleasanter Way; and to make it more so, my old Captain brought an English Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me: After which, we pick\u0027d up two more English Merchants also, and two young Portuguese Gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that we were in all six of us, and five Servants; the two Merchants and the two Portuguese, contenting themselves with one Servant, between two, to save the Charge; and as for me, I got an English Sailor to travel with me as a Servant, besides my Man Friday, who was too much a Stranger to be capable of supplying the Place of a Servant on the Road. \n \n In this Manner I set out from Lisbon; and our Company being all very well mounted and armed, we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the Honour to call me Captain, as well because I was the oldest Man, as because I had two Servants, and indeed was the Original\u0027 of the whole Journey. \n \n As I have troubled you with none of my Sea-Journals, so I shall trouble you now with none of my Land-Journal: But some Adventures that happen\u0027d to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I must not omit. \n \n When we came to Madrid, we being all of us Strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the Court of Spain, and to see what was worth observing; but it being the latter Part of the Summer, we hasten\u0027d away, and set out from Madrid about the Middle of October: But when we came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm\u0027d at several Towns on the Way, with an Account, that so much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the Mountains, that several Travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extream Hazard, to pass on. \n \n When we came to Pampeluna it self, we found it so indeed; and to me that had been always used to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where we could scarce bear any Cloaths on, the Cold was insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than it was surprising, to come but ten Days before out of the old Castile where the Weather was not only warm but very hot, and immediately to feel a Wind from the Pyrenean Mountains, so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intollerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our Fingers and Toes. \n \n Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the Mountains all cover\u0027d with Snow, and felt cold Weather, which he had never seen or felt before in his Life. \n \n To mend the Matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much Violence, and so long, that the People said, Winter was come before its time, and the Roads which were difficult before, were now quite impassable: For in a Word, the Snow lay in some Places too thick for us to travel; and being not hard frozen, as is the Case in Northern Countries: There was no going without being in Danger of being bury\u0027d alive every Step. We stay\u0027d no less than twenty Days at Pampeluna; when seeing the Winter coming on, and no Likelihood of its being better; for it was the severest Winter all over Europe that had been known in the Memory of Man. I propos\u0027d that we should all go away to Fonterabia, and there take Shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a very little Voyage. \n \n But while we were considering this, there came in four French Gentlemen, who having been stopp\u0027d on the French Side of the Passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a Guide, who traversing the Country near the Head of Languedoc, had brought them over the Mountains by such Ways, that they were not much incommoded with the Snow; and where they met with Snow in any Quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their Horses. \n \n We sent for this Guide, who told us, he would undertake to carry us the same Way with no Hazard from the Snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect our selves from wild Beasts; for he said, upon these great Snows, it was frequent for some Wolves to show themselves at the Foot of the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow: We told him, we were well enough prepar\u0027d for such Creatures as they were, if he would ensure us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we were told, we were in most Danger from, especially on the French Side of the Mountains. \n \n He satisfy\u0027d us there was no Danger of that kind in the Way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other Gentlemen, with their Servants, some French, some Spanish; who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again. \n \n Accordingly, we all set Out from Pampeluna, with our Guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed, I was surpriz\u0027d, when instead of going forward, he came directly back with us, on the same Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty Miles; when being pass\u0027d two Rivers, and come into the plain Country, we found our selves in a warm Climate again, where the Country was pleasant, and no Snow to be seen; but on a sudden, turning to his left, he approach\u0027d the Mountains another Way; and though it is true, the Hills and Precipices look\u0027d dreadful, yet he made so many Tours, such Meanders, and led us by such winding Ways, that we were insensibly pass\u0027d the Height of the Mountains, without being much incumbred with the Snow; and all on a sudden, he shew\u0027d us the pleasant fruitful Provinces of Languedoc and Gascoign, all green and flourishing; tho\u0027 indeed it was at a great Distance, and we had some rough Way to pass yet. \n \n We were a little uneasy however, when we found it snow\u0027d one whole Day, and a Night, so fast, that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we should soon be past it all: We found indeed, that we began to descend every Day, and to come more North than before; and so depending upon our Guide, we went on. \n \n It was about two Hours before Night, when our Guide being something before us, and not just in Sight, out rushed three monstrous Wolves, and after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyning to a thick Wood; two of the Wolves flew upon the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before us, he had been devour\u0027d indeed, before we could have help\u0027d him: One of them fastned upon his Horse, and the other attack\u0027d the Man with that Violence, that he had not Time, or not Presence of Mind enough to draw his Pistol, but hollow\u0027d and cry\u0027d out to us most lustily; my Man Friday being next me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the Matter; as soon as Friday came in Sight of the Man, he hollow\u0027d as loud as t\u0027other, O Master! O Master! But like a bold Fellow, rode directly up to the poor Man, and with his Pistol shot the Wolf that attack\u0027d him into the Head. \n \n It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my Man Friday; for he having been us\u0027d to that kind of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon him; but went close up to him, and shot him as above; whereas any of us, would have fir\u0027d at a farther Distance, and have perhaps either miss\u0027d the Wolf, or endanger\u0027d shooting the Man. \n \n But it was enough to have terrify\u0027d a bolder Man than I, and indeed it alarm\u0027d all our Company, when with the Noise of Friday\u0027s Pistol, we heard on both Sides the dismallest Howling of Wolves, and the Noise redoubled by the Eccho of the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious Multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a Few, as that we had no cause of Apprehensions. \n \n However, as Friday had kill\u0027d this Wolf, the other that had fastned upon the Horse, left him immediately, and fled; having happily fastned upon his Head, where the Bosses of the Bridle had stuck in his Teeth; so that he had not done him much Hurt: The Man indeed was most Hurt; for the raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the Disorder of his Horse, when Friday came up and shot the Wolf. \n \n It is easy to suppose, that at the Noise of Friday\u0027s Pistol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as fast as the Way (which was very difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the Matter; as soon as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the Case, and how Friday had disengag\u0027d the poor Guide; though we did not presently discern what kind of Creature it was he had kill\u0027d. \n \n But never was a Fight manag\u0027d so hardily, and in such a surprizing Manner, as that which follow\u0027d between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all (though at first we were surpriz\u0027d and afraid for him) the greatest Diversion imaginable: As the Bear is a heavy, clumsey Creature, and does not gallop as the Wolf does, who is swift, and light; so he has two particular Qualities, which generally are the Rule of his Actions; First, As to Men, who are not his proper Prey; I say, not his proper Prey; because tho\u0027 I cannot say what excessive Hunger might do, which was now their Case, the Ground being all cover\u0027d with Snow; but as to Men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they first attack him: On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if you don\u0027t meddle with him, he won\u0027t meddle with you; but then you must take Care to be very Civil to him, and give him the Road; for he is a very nice Gentleman, he won\u0027t go a Step out of his Way for a Prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another Way, and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadily at him, he takes it for an Affront; but if you throw or toss any Thing at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of a Stick, as big as your Finger, he takes it for an Affront, and sets all his other Business aside to pursue his Revenge; for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour; that is his first Quality: The next is, That if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, Night or Day, till he has his Revenge; but follows at a good round rate, till he overtakes you. \n \n My Man Friday had deliver\u0027d our Guide, and when we came up to him, he was helping him off from his Horse; for the Man was both hurt and frighted, and indeed, the last more than the first; when on the sudden, we spy\u0027d the Bear come Out Of the Wood, and a vast monstrous One it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw: We were all a little surpriz\u0027d, when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see Joy and Courage in the Fellow\u0027s Countenance; O! O! O! Says Friday, three Times, pointing to him; O Master, You give me te Leave! Me shakee te Hand mith him: Me make you good laugh. \n \n I was surpriz\u0027d to see the Fellow so pleas\u0027d; You Fool you, says I, he mill eat you up: Eatee me up! Eatee me up! Says Friday, twice over again; Me eatee him up: Me make you good laugh: You all stay here, me show you good laugh; so down he sits, and gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Pair of Pumps (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) and which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Servant his Horse, and with his Gun away he flew swift like the Wind. \n \n The Bear was walking softly on, and offer\u0027d to meddle with no Body, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the Bear could understand him; Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me speakee wit your: We follow\u0027d at a Distance; for now being come down on the Gascoign side of the Mountains, we were entred a vast great Forest, where the Country was plain, and pretty open, though many Trees in it scatter\u0027d here and there. \n \n Friday, who had as we say, the Heels of the Bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a great Stone, and throws at him, and hit him just on the Head; but did him no more harm, than if he had thrown it against a Wall; but it answer\u0027d Friday\u0027s End; for the Rogue was so void of Fear, that he did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and show us some Laugh as he call\u0027d it. \n \n As soon as the Bear felt the Stone, and saw him, he turns about, and comes after him, taking Devilish long Strides, and shuffling along at a strange Rate, so as would have put a Horse to a midling Gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his Course, as if he run towards us for Help; so we all resolv\u0027d to fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man; though I was angry at him heartily, for bringing the Bear back upon us, when he was going about his own Business another Way; and especially I was angry that he had turn\u0027d the Bear upon us, and then run away; and I call\u0027d out, You Dog, said I, is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your Horse, that me may shoot the Creature; he hears me, and crys Out, No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two Foot for the Beast\u0027s one, he turn\u0027d on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for his Purpose, he beckon\u0027d to us to follow, and doubling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree laying his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five or six Yards from the Bottom of the Tree. \n \n The Bear soon came to the Tree, and we follow\u0027d at a Distance; the first Thing he did, he stopp\u0027d at the Gun, smelt to it, but let it lye, and up he scrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat, though so monstrously heavy: I was amazed at the Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not for my Life see any Thing to laugh at yet, till seeing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rod nearer to him. \n \n When we came to the Tree, there was Friday got out to the small End of a large Limb of the Tree, and the Bear got about half way to him; as soon as the Bear got out to that part where the Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you see me teachee the Bear dance; so he falls a jumping and shaking the Bough, at which the Bear began to totter, but stood still, and begun to look behind him, to see how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh heartily: But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when he sees him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he had suppos\u0027d the Bear could speak English; What you no come farther, pray you come farther; so he left jumping and shaking the Tree; and the Bear, just as if he had understood what he said, did come a little further, then he fell a jumping again, and the Bear stopp\u0027d again. \n \n We thought now was a good time to knock him on the Head, and I call\u0027d to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the Bear; but he cry\u0027d out earnestly, O pray! O pray! No shoot, me shoot, by and then; he would have said, By and by: However, to shorten the Story, Friday danc\u0027d so much, and the Bear Stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the Fellow would do; for first we thought he depended upon shaking the Bear off; and we found the Bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad Claws and Feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the End of it, and where the Jest would be at last. \n \n But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the Bear cling fast to the Bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther; Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther, me go, me go; you no come to me, me go come to you; and upon this, he goes out to the smallest End of the Bough, where it would bend with his Weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the Bough, till he came near enough to jump down on his Feet, and away he run to his Gun, takes it up, and stands still. \n \n Well, said I to him Friday, What will you do now? Why don\u0027t you shoot him? No shoot, says Friday, no yet, me shoot nom, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh; and indeed so he did, as you will see presently; for when the Bear see his Enemy gone, he comes back from the Bough where he stood; but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every Step, and coming backward till he got into the Body of the Tree; then with the same hinder End foremost, he came down the Tree, grasping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot at a Time, very leisurely; at this Juncture, and just before he could set his hind Feet upon the Ground, Friday stept up close to him, clapt the Muzzle of his Piece into his Ear, and shot him dead as a Stone. \n \n Then the Rogue turn\u0027d about, to see if we did not laugh, and when he saw we were pleas\u0027d by our Looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud; so me kill Bear in my Country, says Friday; so you kill them, says I, Why you have no Guns: \n \n No, says he, no Gun, but shoot, great much long Arrow. \n \n This was indeed a good Diversion to us; but we were still in a wild Place, and our Guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the Howling of Wolves run much in my Head; and indeed, except the Noise I once heard on the Shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard any thing that filled me with so much Horrour. \n \n These things, and the Approach of Night, called us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the Skin of this monstrous Creature off, which was which saving; but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide hasten\u0027d us, so we left him, and went forward on our Journey. \n \n The Ground was still cover\u0027d with Snow, tho\u0027 not so deep and dangerous as on the Mountains, and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the Forest and plain Country, press\u0027d by Hunger to seek for Food; and had done a great deal of Mischief in the Villages, where they surpriz\u0027d the Country People, kill\u0027d a great many of their Sheep and Horses, and some People too. \n \n We had one dangerous Place to pass, which our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves in the Country, we should find them there; and this was in a small Plain, surrounded with Woods on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane, which we were to pass to get through the Wood, and then we should come to the Village where we were to lodge. \n \n It was within half an Hour of Sun-set when we entred the first Wood; and a little after Sun-set, when we came into the Plain. We met with nothing in the first Wood, except, that in a little Plain within the Wood, which was not above two Furlongs over, we saw five great Wolves cross the Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had been in Chase of some Prey, and had it in View; they took no Notice of us, and were gone, and out of our Sight in a few Moments. \n \n Upon this our Guide, who by the Way was a wretched faint-hearted Fellow, bid us keep in a ready Posture; for he believed there were more Wolves a coming. \n \n We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us, but we saw no more Wolves, \u0027till we came thro\u0027 that Wood, which was near half a League, and entred the Plain; as soon as we came into the Plain, we had Occasion enough to look about us: The first Object we met with, was a dead Horse; that is to say, a poor Horse which the Wolves had kill\u0027d, and at least a Dozen of them at Work; we could not say eating of him, but picking of his Bones rather; for they had eaten up all the Flesh before. \n \n We did not think fit to disturb them at their Feast, neither did they take much Notice of us: Friday would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any Means; for I found we were like to have more Business upon our Hands than we were aware of. We were not gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the Wolves howl in the Wood on our Left, in a frightful Manner, and presently alter we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a Body, and most of them in a Line, as regularly as an Army drawn up by experienc\u0027d Officers. I scarce knew in what Manner to receive them; but found to draw our selves in a close Line was the only Way: so we form\u0027d in a Moment: But that we might not have too much Interval, I order\u0027d, that only every other Man should fire, and that the others who had not fir\u0027d should stand ready to give them a second Volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us, and that then those who had fir\u0027d at first, should not pretend to load their Fusees again, but stand ready with every one a Pistol; for we were all arm\u0027d with a Fusee, and a Pair of Pistols each Man; so we were by this Method able to fire six Volleys, half of us at a Time; however, at present we had no Necessity; for upon firing the first Volley, the Enemy made a full Stop, being terrify\u0027d as well with the Noise, as with the Fire; four of them being shot into the Head, dropp\u0027d, several others were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the Snow: I found they stopp\u0027d, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon remembring that I had been told, that the fiercest Creatures were terrify\u0027d at the Voice of a Man, I caus\u0027d all our Company to hollow as loud as we could; and I found the Notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our Shout, they began to retire, and turn about; then I order\u0027d a second Volley to be fir\u0027d, in their Rear, which put them to the Gallop, and away they went to the Woods. \n \n This gave us leisure to charge our Pieces again, and that we might loose no Time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded our Fusees, and put our selves into a Readiness, when we heard a terrible Noise in the same Wood, on our Left, only that it was farther onward the same Way we were to go. \n \n The Night was coming on, and the Light began to be dusky, which made it worse on our Side; but the Noise encreasing, we could easily perceive that it was the Howling and Yelling of those hellish Creatures; and on a sudden, we perceiv\u0027d 2 or 3 Troops of Wolves, one on our Left, one behind us, and one on our Front; so that we seem\u0027d to be surrounded with \u0027em; however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as fast as we could make Our Horses go, which the Way being very rough, was only a good large Trot; and in this Manner we came in View of the Entrance of a Wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther Side of the Plain; but we were greatly surpriz\u0027d, when coming nearer the Lane, or Pass, we saw a confus\u0027d Number of Wolves standing just at the Entrance. \n \n On a sudden, at another opening of the Wood, we heard the Noise of a Gun; and looking that Way, out rush\u0027d a Horse, with a Saddle, and a Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and sixteen or seventeen Wolves after him, full Speed; indeed, the Horse had the Heels of them; but as we suppos\u0027d that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at last, and no question but they did. \n \n But here we had a most horrible Sight; for riding up to the Entrance where the Horse came out, we found the Carcass of another Horse, and of two Men, devour\u0027d by the ravenous Creatures, and one of the Men was no doubt the same who we heard fir\u0027d the Gun; for there lay a Gun just by him, fir\u0027d off; but as to the Man, his Head, and the upper Part of his Body was eaten up. \n \n This fill\u0027d us with Horror, and we knew not what Course to take, but the Creatures resolv\u0027d us\u0027 soon; for they gather\u0027d about us presently, in hopes of Prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them: It happen\u0027d very much to our Advantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but a little Way from it, there lay some large Timber Trees, which had been cut down the Summer before, and I Suppose lay there for Carriage; I drew my little Troop in among those Trees, and placing our selves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I advis\u0027d them all to light, and keeping that Tree before us, for a Breast Work, to stand in a Triangle, or three Fronts, enclosing Our Horses in the Center. \n \n We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious Charge than the Creatures made upon us in the Place; they came on us with a growling kind of a Noise (and mounted the Piece of Timber, which as I said, was our Breast Work) as if they were only rushing upon their Prey; and this Fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasion\u0027d by their seeing our Horses behind us, which was the Prey they aim\u0027d at: I order\u0027d our Men to fire as before, every other Man; and they took their Aim so sure, that indeed they kill\u0027d several of the Wolves at the first Volley; but there was a Necessity to keep a continual Firing; for they came on like Devils, those behind pushing on those before. \n \n When we had fir\u0027d our second Volley of our Fusees, we thought they stopp\u0027d a little, and hop\u0027d they would have gone off; but it was but a Moment; for others came forward again; so we fir\u0027d two Volleys of our Pistols, and I believe in these four Firings, we had kill\u0027d seventeen or eighteen of them, and lam\u0027d twice as many; yet they came on again. \n \n I was loath to spend our last Shot too hastily; so I call\u0027d my Servant, not my Man Friday, for he was better employ\u0027d; for with the greatest Dexterity imaginable, he had charg\u0027d my Fusee, and his own, while we were engag\u0027d; but as I said, I call\u0027d my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder, I bad him lay a Train, all along the Piece of Timber, and let it be a large Train; he did so, and had but just Time to get away, when the Wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon it; when I snapping an uncharg\u0027d Pistol, close to the Powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the Timber were scorcht with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather jump\u0027d in among us, with the Force and Fright of the Fire; we dispatch\u0027d these in an Instant, and the rest were so frighted with the Light, which the Night, for it was now very near Dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little. \n \n Upon which I order\u0027d our last Pistol to be fir\u0027d off in one Volley, and after that we gave a Shout; upon this, the Wolves turn\u0027d Tail, and we sally\u0027d immediately upon near twenty lame Ones, who we found struggling on the Ground, and fell a cutting them with our Swords, which answer\u0027d our Expectation; for the Crying and Howling they made, was better understood by their Fellows, so that they all fled and left us. \n \n We had, first and last, kill\u0027d about three Score of them; and had it been Day-Light, we had kill\u0027d many more: The Field of Battle being thus clear\u0027d, we made forward again; for we had still near a League to go. We heard the ravenous Creatures houl and yell in the Woods as we went, several Times; and sometimes we fancy\u0027d we saw some of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes, we were not certain; so in about an Hour more, we came to the Town, where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible Fright, and all in Arms; for it seems, that the Night before, the Wolves and some Bears had broke into the Village in the Night, and put them in a terrible Fright, and they were oblig\u0027d to keep Guard Night and Day, but especially in the Night, to preserve their Cattle, and indeed their People. \n \n The next Morning our Guide was so ill, and his Limbs swell\u0027d with the rankling of his two Wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were oblig\u0027d to take a new Guide there, and go to Tholouse, where we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleasant Country, and no Snow, no Wolves, or any Thing like them; but when we told our Story at Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great Forest at the Foot of the Mountains, especially when the Snow lay on the Ground: But they enquir\u0027d much what kind of a Guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that Way in such a severe Season; and told us, it was very much\u0027 we were not all devour\u0027d. When we told them how we plac\u0027d our selves, and the Horses in the Middle, they blam\u0027d us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroy\u0027d; for it was the Sight of the Horses which made the Wolves so furious, Seeing their Prey; and that at other Times they are really afraid of a Gun; but the being excessive Hungry, and raging on that Account, the Eagerness to come at the Horses had made them sensless of Danger; and that if we had not by the continu\u0027d Fire, and at last by the Stratagem of the Train of Powder, master\u0027d them, it had been great Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces; whereas had we been content to have sat still on Horseback, and fir\u0027d as Horsemen, they would not have taken the Horses for so much their own, when Men were on their Backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our Horses, they would have been so eager to have devour\u0027d them, that we might have come off safe, especially having our Fire Arms in our Hands, and being so many in Number. \n \n For my Part, I was never so sensible of Danger in my Life; for seeing above three hundred Devils come roaring and open mouth\u0027d to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave my self over for lost; and as was, I believe, I shall never care to cross those Mountains again; I think I would much rather go a thousand Leagues by Sea, though I were sure to meet with a Storm once a Week. \n \n I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in my Passage through France; nothing but what other Travellers have given an Account of, with much more Advantage than I can. I travell\u0027d from Tholouse to Paris, and without any considerable Stay, came to Callais, and landed safe at Dover, the fourteenth of January, after having had a severely cold Season to travel in. \n \n I was now come to the Center of my Travels, and had in a little Time all my new discover\u0027d Estate safe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I brought with me having been very currently paid. \n \n My principal Guide, and Privy Councellor, was my good antient Widow, who in Gratitude for the Money I had sent her, thought no Pains too much, or Care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with every Thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the Security of my Effects; and indeed, I was very happy from my Beginning, and now to the End, in the unspotted Integrity of this good Gentle-woman. \n \n And now I began to think of leaving my Effects with this Woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasils; but now another Scruple came in my Way, and that was Religion; for as I had entertain\u0027d some Doubts about the Roman Religion, even while I was abroad, especially in my State of Solitude; so I knew there was no going to the Brasils for me, much less going to settle there, unless I resolv\u0027d to embrace the Roman Catholick Religion, without any Reserve; unless on the other hand, I resolv\u0027d to be a Sacrifice to my Principles, be a Martyr for Religion, and die in the Inquisition; so I resolv\u0027d to stay at Home, and if I could find Means for it, to dispose of my Plantation. \n \n To this Purpose I wrote to my old Friend at Lisbon, who in Return gave me Notice, that he could easily dispose of it there: But that if I thought fit to give him Leave to offer it In my Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my Trustees, who liv\u0027d in the Brasils, who must fully under+ stand the Value of it, who liv\u0027d just upon the Spot, and who I knew were very rich; so that he believ\u0027d they would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but I should make 4 or 5000 Pieces Of Eight, the more of it. \n \n Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it to them, and he did so; and in about 8 Months more, the Ship being then return\u0027d, he sent me Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and had remitted 33000 Pieces Of Eight, to a Correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it. \n \n In Return, I sign\u0027d the Instrument of Sale in the Form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old Man, who sent me Bills of Exchange for 32800 Pieces of Eight to me, for the Estate; reserving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to him, the old Man, during his Life, and 50 Moidores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I had promised them, which the Plantation was to make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus I have given the first Part of a Life of Fortune and Adventure, a Life of Providence\u0027s Checquer-Work, and of a Variety which the World will seldom be able to show the like of: Beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any Part of it ever gave me Leave so much as to hope for. \n \n Any one would think, that in this State of complicated good Fortune, I was past running any more Hazards; and so indeed I had been, if other Circumstances had concurr\u0027d, but I was inur\u0027d to a wandring Life, had no Family, not many Relations, nor however rich had I contracted much Acquaintance; and though I had sold my Estate in the Brasils, yet I could not keep the Country out of my Head, and had a great Mind to be upon the Wing again, especially I could not resist the strong Inclination I had to see my Island, and to\u0027 know if the poor Spaniards were in Being there, and how the Rogues I left there had used them. \n \n My true Friend, the Widow, earnestly diswaded me from it, and so far prevail\u0027d with me, that for almost seven Years she prevented my running Abroad; during which time, I took my two Nephews, the Children of one of my Brothers into my Care: The eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave him a Settlement of some Addition to his Estate, after my Decease; the other I put out to a Captain of a Ship; and after five Years, finding him a sensible bold enterprising young Fellow, I put him into a good Ship, and sent him to Sea: And this young Fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther Adventures my self. \n \n In the mean time, I in Part settled my self here; for first of all I marry\u0027d, and that not either to my Disadvantage or Dissatisfaction, and had three Children, two Sons and one Daughter: But my Wife dying, and my Nephew coming Home with good Success from a Voyage to Spain, my Inclination to go Abroad, and his Importunity prevailed and engag\u0027d me to go in his Ship, as a private Trader to the East Indies: This was in the Year 1694. \n \n In this Voyage I visited my new Collony in the Island, saw my Successors the Spaniards, had the whole Story of their Lives, and of the Villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were oblig\u0027d to use Violence with them, how they were subjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them; a History, if it were entred into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents, as my own Part, particularly also as to their Battles with the Carribeans, who landed several times upon the Island, and as to the Improvement they made upon the Island it self, and how five of them made an Attempt upon the main Land, and brought away eleven Men and five Women Prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young Children on the Island. \n \n Here I stay\u0027d about 20 Days, left them Supplies of all necessary things, and particularly of Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two Workmen, which I brought from England with me, viz. a Carpenter and a Smith. \n \n Besides this, I shar\u0027d the Island into Parts with \u0027em, reserv\u0027d to my self the Property of the whole, but gave them such Parts respectively as they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged them not to leave the Place, I left them there. \n \n From thence I touch\u0027d at the Brasils, from whence I sent a Bark, which I bought there, with more People to the Island, and in it, besides other Supplies, I sent seven Women, being such as I found proper for Service, or for Wives to such as would take them: As to the English Men, I promis\u0027d them to send them some Women from England, with a good Cargoe of Necessaries, if they would apply themselves to Planting, which I afterwards perform\u0027d. And the Fellows prov\u0027d very honest and diligent after they were master\u0027d, and had their Properties set apart for them. I sent them also from the Brasils five Cows, three of them being big with Calf, some Sheep, and some Hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably encreas\u0027d. \n \n But all these things, with an Account how 300 Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruin\u0027d their Plantations, and how they fought with that whole Number twice, and were at first defeated, and three of them kill\u0027d; but at last a Storm destroying their Enemies Cannoes, they famish\u0027d or destroy\u0027d almost all the rest, and renew\u0027d and recover\u0027d the Possession of their Plantation, and still liv\u0027d upon the Island. \n \n All these things, with some very surprizing Incidents in some new Adventures of my own, for ten Years more, I may perhaps give a farther Account of hereafter. \n \n \n \n 我听清了信号，便倒下来睡觉。我整整忙碌了一天，已十分劳累，所以睡得很香。忽然，睡梦中听到一声枪声，把我惊醒。我马上爬起来，听到有人在喊我： \n \n \"总督！总督！\"我一听是船长的声音，就爬上小山头，一看果然是他。他指了指大船，把我搂在怀里。\"我亲爱的朋友，我的救命恩人，\"他说，\"这是你的船，它是你的，我们这些人和船上的一切也都是你的！\"我看了看大船，只见它停泊在离岸不到半英里的地方。原来，船长他们夺回了大船后，看见天气晴朗，便起了锚，把船一直开到小河口上。这时正好涨潮，船长就把长艇划到我当初卸木排的地方靠岸，也就是正好在城堡门口上岸。 \n \n 开初，这突如其来的喜事，使我几乎晕倒在地，因为我亲眼看到我脱险的事已十拿九稳，且一切顺利，而且还有一艘大船可以把我送到任何我想去的地方。有好半天，我一句话也答不上来。如果不是船长用手紧紧抱着我，我也紧紧靠在他身上，我早已倒在地上了。 \n \n 他看见我那么激动，马上从袋里取出一个起子，把他特地为我带来的提神酒给我喝了几口。喝完之后，我就坐在地上。虽然这几口酒使我清醒了过来，可是又过了好半天，才说得出话来。 \n \n 这时候，船长也和我一样欣喜若狂，只是不像我那么激动罢了。于是，他对我说了无数亲切温暖的话，让我安定下来，清醒过来。但我心中惊喜交加，竟不能自己。最后，我失声大哭。又过了好一会，才能开口说话。 \n \n 这时，我拥抱了船长，把他当作我的救命恩人。我们两个人都喜不自胜。我告诉他，在我看来，他是上天特意派来救我脱险的；又说这件事的经过简直是一连串的奇迹。这类事情证明，有一种天意在冥冥中支配着世界，证明上帝无所不在，并能看清天涯海角发生的一切，只要他愿意，任何时候都可以救助不幸的人。 \n \n 我也没有忘记衷心感谢上天。在这荒无人烟的小岛上，在这样孤苦伶仃的处境中，我不仅没有饿死，正是上帝的奇迹，赐给我饮食；而且，我一次又一次地绝处逢生，逃过大难，也都是上帝对我的恩赐。上苍如此厚爱其子民，谁能不对他感到衷心的感激呢？ \n \n 船长跟我谈了一会儿，便告诉我，他给我带了一点饮料和食物。这些东西，只是暴徒们劫后残剩下来的，所以只能拿出这么一点了。说着，他向小船高声喊了一声，吩咐他手下人把献给总督的东西搬上岸来。这实际上是一份丰厚的礼物，初看起来，好像要让我在岛上继续呆下去，不准备把我载走了。 \n \n 首先，他给我带来了一箱高级的提神酒，六大瓶马德拉白葡萄酒，每瓶有两夸脱，两磅上等烟叶，十二块上好的牛肉脯，六块猪肉，一袋豆子和大约一百磅饼干。 \n \n 另外，他还给我带来了一箱糖，一箱面粉，一袋柠檬，两瓶柠檬汁和许多其他东西。除此之外，对我更有用处的是，他给我带来了六件新衬衫，六条上等领巾，两副手套，一双鞋，一顶帽子，一双长袜，还有一套他自己穿的西装，西装还很新，看来他没有穿过几次。总之，他们我从头到脚都穿戴起来了。 \n \n 不难想象，对于我这种处境的人，这是一份慷慨而令人喜悦的礼物。可是，我刚把这些衣服穿上身的时候，感到很不自在，因为既不舒服，又很别扭。 \n \n 送礼的仪式完毕，东西也都搬进了我的住所，我们便商议处置俘虏的问题。我们必须考虑是否冒风险把他们带走。尤其是他们中间有两个人，我们认为是绝对无可救药、顽固不化的暴徒。船长说，他知道他俩都是坏蛋，没法对他们宽大。 \n \n 即使把他们带走，也必须把他们像犯人一样关起来。只要他的船开到任何一个英国殖民地，就把他们送交当局法办。我感到船长对此事确实也很担心。 \n \n 对此，我告诉船长，如果他同意，我可以负责说服那两个人，让他们自己提出请求留在岛上。\"我很高兴你能那样做，\"船长说，\"我衷心同意！\"\"那很好， \n \n \"我说，\"我现在就把他们叫来，替你跟他们谈谈。\"这样，我吩咐星期五和那两个人质去执行这一任务。当时，我们早已把那两个人质释放了，因为他们的同伙实践了他们的诺言。他们就一起到洞室去，把关在那儿的五个人照旧绑着手，带到了我的乡间别墅里；到了后先把他们关押起来，等我去处置。 \n \n 过了一会，我就穿上新衣服去了。现在，我又以总督的身份出现了。我和船长到了那边，跟我们的人碰了头，我就叫人把那五个人带到我面前来。我对他们说，关于他们对待船长的罪恶行为，我已获得了详细的报告。我已了解他们怎样把船夺走，并还准备继续去干抢劫的勾当。但上帝却使他们自投罗网，跌进了他们替别人挖掘的陷井。 \n \n \n 我让他们知道，在我的指挥下，大船已经夺回来了，现在正停泊在海口里。他们过一会就可以看到，他们的新船长被吊在桅杆顶上示众，他的罪恶行径得到了报应。 \n \n 至于他们，我倒想知道他们还有什么话可说。事实上，我完全可以把他们以海盗论处。当然，他们大概绝不会怀疑，我完全有权把他们处死。 \n \n 这时，他们中间有一个人出来代表大家说话了。他说，他们没有什么话可说。只是他们被俘时，船长曾答应饶他们不死的。他们现在只有低头恳求我的宽宥。可是，我告诉他们，因为我自己已决定带着手下的人离开本岛，跟船长一起搭船回英国去，所以我不知道该如何宽宥他们。至于船长，他只能把他们当作囚犯关起来带回英国，并以谋反和劫船的罪名送交当局审判。其结果他们应该都知道，那必定是上绞架。所以，我实在也为他们想不出更好的办法，除非他们决定留在岛上，听任命运的安排。如果他们同意这个办法，我本人没有意见，因为我反正要离开本岛了。只要他们愿意留在岛上自谋生计，我可以饶他们不死。 \n \n 他们对此表示十分感激。他们说，他们宁可冒险留在这里，也不愿被带回英国吊死。所以，我就决定这么办了。 \n \n 然而，船长似乎不太同意这个办法，好像他不敢把他们留在岛上。于是，我对船长作出生气的样子。我对他说，他们是我的俘虏，而不是他的俘虏。我既然对他们已许下了这么多人情，我说的话就应该算数。如果他不同意，我就把他们放掉，只当我没有把他们抓住过。如果他不愿意给他们自由，他自己可以去把他们抓回来，只要他能抓得祝他们看到这种情况，表示无限感激。于是，我释放了他们，叫他们退回原来被抓住的树林里去，并对他们说，我可以给他们留一些枪支弹药，并指导他们怎样在这儿好好过活，如果他们愿意接受的话。 \n \n 解决了俘虏的问题，我就开始作上船的准备了。我对船长说，我还得作些准备，所以还得在岛上耽搁一个晚上。我吩咐他先回船上，把一切安排好，第二天再放小船到岸上来接我。我特别下令，让他把那打死的新船长吊在桅杆顶上示众。 \n \n 船长走之后，我派人把那几个人带到我房间里来。我给他们作了一次严肃的谈话，分析了他们当前的处境。我对他们说，我认为他们的选择是正确的。如果让船长把他们带走，其结果必然是上绞架吊死。我把那吊在大船桅杆顶上的新船长指给他们看，并告诉他们，他们也没有别的指望，只能是这种下常他们一致表示愿意留在岛上。于是，我就把我这里生活的情况告诉他们，并教会他们怎样把生活过好。我谈了小岛的环境，以及我在这儿生活的经历。我领他们看了我的城堡，告诉他们如何做面包，种庄稼，晒制葡萄干。一句话，一切能使他们生活过得舒适一点的办法，我都告诉他们了。我又把十六位西班牙人的事情告诉了他们，并对他们说，不久他们也要来岛上了。我给那些西班牙人留了一封信，并要他们答应对他们一视同仁。 \n \n 我把枪支都留给了他们，其中包括五支短枪，三支鸟枪，还加三把刀。我还留下了一桶半火药。我之所以还有这么多火药，是因为我用得很省，除了开始两年用掉一些外，后来我就一点都不敢浪费。我还把养山羊的方法教给了他们，告诉他们怎样把羊养肥，怎样挤羊奶，做奶油，制乳酪。 \n \n 总之，我把自己的经历详详细细地告诉了他们。我还对他们说，我要劝船长再给他们留下两桶火药与一些菜种。我对他们说，菜种一直是我所求之不得的东西。我还把船长送给我的一袋豆子也留给了他们，嘱咐他们作种子播下去繁殖起来。 \n \n 这些事情办完后，第二天我就离开他们上了大船。我们本来准备立即开船，可是直到晚上都没有起锚。第二天一大早，那五个人中有两个人忽然向船边泅来。他们诉说那三个人怎样歧视他们，样子甚为可怜。他们恳求我们看在上帝份上收留他们，不然准会给那三个人杀死。他们哀求船长收留他们，就是马上把他们吊死也心甘情愿。 \n \n 船长看到这种情形，就假装自己无权决定，要征得我的同意才行。后来，经过种种留难，他们也发誓痛改前非，才把他们收容上船。上船后，每人结结实实地挨了一顿鞭子，打完后再用盐和醋擦伤处。从那以后，他们果然成了安份守己的人了。 \n \n 过了一会儿，潮水上涨了。我就命令把我答应给那三个人的东西，用小船运到岸上去。我又向船长说情，把他们三人的箱子和衣服一起送去。他们收到后，都千恩万谢，感激不荆我又鼓励他们说，如果将来我有机会派船来接他们，我一定不会忘记他们。 \n \n 离开小岛时，我把自己做的那顶羊皮帽、羊皮伞和我的鹦鹉都带上船，作为纪念。同时，我也没有忘记把钱拿走。这些钱一共有两笔，一笔是从自己所剩的破船上拿下来的；另一笔是从那条失事的西班牙船上找到的。这情况我在前面都已交待过了。这些钱由于一直存放在那里没有使用的机会，现在都已生锈了。若不经过一番磨擦和处理，谁也认不出是银币。 \n \n 这样，根据船上的日历，我在一六八六年十二月十九日，离开了这个海岛。我一共在岛上住了二十八年两个月零十九天。我第二次遇难而获救的这一天，恰好和我第一次从萨累的摩尔人手里坐长艇里逃出来，是同月同日。 \n \n 我乘这条船航行了半年多，终于在一六八七年七月十一日抵达英国。计算起来，我离国已经三十五年了。 \n \n 我回到英国，人人都把我当外国人，好像我从未在英国住过似的。我那位替我保管钱财的恩人和忠实的管家，这时还活着。不过她的遭遇非常不幸。她再嫁之后又成了寡妇，境况十分悲惨。我叫她不要把欠我的钱放在心上，并对她说，我决不会找她麻烦。相反，为了报答她以前对我的关心和忠诚，我又尽我微薄的财力给了她一点接济。当然，我现在财力有限，不能对她有多少帮助。可是，我向她保证，我永远不会忘记她以前对我的好处，并告诉她，只要我将来有力量帮助她，我决不会忘记她。这是后话了。 \n \n 后来，我去了约克郡。我父亲已经过世，我母亲及全家也都成古人了。我只找到了两个妹妹和我一位哥哥的两个孩子。因为大家都以为我早已不在世上了，所以没有留给我一点遗产。一句话，我完全找不到一点接济和资助，而我身上的一点钱，根本无法帮助我成家立业。 \n \n 万万没有料到的是，在我这样窘迫的时候，却有人对我感恩图报。我意外救了船长，也救了他的船和货物。这时，船长把我怎样救了全船和船上的人，详详细细地报告了那些船主。他们就把我邀请去，和他们以及几个有关的商人会面。他们对我的行为大大地赞扬了一番，又送了我两百英镑作为酬谢。 \n \n 我对自己当前的处境反复考虑，感到实难安身立命，就决定到里斯本去一趟，看看能不能打听到我在巴西的种植园和那合股人的情况。我相信，我那合股人一定以为我死了多年了。 \n \n 抱着这一希望，我搭上了开往里斯本的船，于第二年四月份到达了那里。当我这样东奔西跑的时候，我的星期五一直跟着我，诚实可靠，并证明无论何时何地，他都是我最忠实的仆人。 \n \n 到了里斯本，我几经打听，找到了我的老朋友，也就是把我从非洲海面上救起来的那位船长。这真使我高兴极了。船长现在年事已高，早就不再出海了；他让儿子当了船长，而儿子也已近中年了，仍旧做巴西生意。那老人家已经不认得我了；说实在话，我也一样认不出他了。但不久我就记起了他的面貌。当我告诉他我是谁之后，他也记起了我的面貌。 \n \n 老友重逢，交谈之际，言词热切。不用说，我接着就询问了我的种植园和合股人的情况。老人家告诉我，他已有九年没有去巴西了。但他可以向我保证，当他离开那里的时候，我的合股人还在人世。我曾委托他和另外两位代理人照管我的产业。尽管那两位代理人已经过世，但他相信，关于我那种植园的收益，我还是不难收到一份种植园这几十年来发展的详细报告。因为，当时人们以为我出事淹死之后，我的几位产权代理人就把我在种植园股份内应得的收入，报告给税务官。税务官怕我永远也回不来接受这笔财产，就作了如下的处理：收入的三分之一划归国王，三分之二拨给圣奥古斯丁修道院，作为救济灾民以及在印第安人中传播天主教之用。 \n \n 但如果我回来，或有人申请继承我的遗产，我的财产就能还给我，不过已经分配给慈善事业的历年收入，是不能发还的。 \n \n 但他向我保证，政府征收土地税的官员和修道院的司事，一直在监督着我的合股人，叫他把每年的收入交出一份可靠的账目，并把我应得的部分上缴。 \n \n 我问他是否知道种植园发展的情况？又问他，在他看来，是否还值得经营下去？如果我去巴西，要把我应得的部分收回来，是否会有什么困难？ \n \n 他对我说，种植园发展的具体情况，他实在也不清楚。可是他知道，我那合股人尽管只享有种植园一半的收入，但已成了当地的巨富。他又告诉我，现在回忆起来，他曾听说，仅仅政府收到我所应得的三分之一，每年就达二百葡萄牙金币以上；这部分钱好像拨给了另一个修道院或什么宗教机构去了。要收回这笔财产，应该是不成问题的，因为我的合股人还活着，可以证明我的股权，而且，我的名字也在巴西登记在册。他又告诉我，我那两位代理人的财产继承人，都是很公正诚实的人，而且都很富有。他相信，我不仅可以获得他们的帮助，领到我的财产，而且，还可以从他们那里拿到一大笔属于我的现款。那是在他们父亲保管期间我每年的收入。 \n \n 据他记忆，把我收入部分缴公，还只是十二年以前的事。 \n \n 我听了他的话，心里感到有些烦恼和不安。我问那老船长，我既然立了遗嘱，指定他，这位葡萄牙籍船长，作为我财产的全权继承人，那两位代理人怎么能这样处理我的财产呢？ \n \n 他对我说，他确实是我的继承人。但是，关于我的死亡一直无法证实。在没有获得我死亡的确切消息之前，他不能作为我遗嘱的执行人。而且，还有一层，这远隔重洋的事，他也不愿意干预。但他又说，他确实把我的遗嘱向有关部门登记过，而且提出了他的产权要求。如果他能提出我的死亡证明，他早已根据财产委托权，接管了我的糖厂，并派目前在巴西的儿子去经营了。 \n \n \"可是，\"那老人家又说，\"我还有一件事要告诉你。这事你听了可能会不太高兴。当时，我们都以为你已死了，大家也都这样认为，你的合股人和代理人就把你头六七年的收入交给了我，我也都收下了。但当时，种植园正在发展，需扩充设备，建立糖厂，又要买奴隶，所以收入就没有后来的那么多。不过，我一定把我的收入及花费开一份可靠的账单给你。\"我和这位老朋友又连续商谈了好几天，他就把我种植园最初六年的细账交给了我，上面有我的合股人和两位代理人的签字。当时交出来的都是现货，像成捆的烟叶，成箱的糖；此外，还有糖厂的一些副产品，像糖蜜酒和糖蜜等东西。从账目中我可以看到，收入每年都有增加，但正如上面所提到的，由于开头几年开支较大，实际收入不大。尽管如此，老人家还是告诉我，他欠我四百七十块葡萄牙金币，另外还有六十箱糖和十五大捆烟叶。那些货物在船只开往里斯本的航行中因失事而全部损失了。那是我离开巴西十一年以后发生的事。 \n \n \n 这位善良的人开始向我诉说了他不幸的遭遇，说他万不得已，才拿我的钱去弥补损失，在一条新船上搭了一股。\"不过，我的老朋友，\"他说，\"你要用钱的话，钱是有的。等我儿子回来，就可以把钱都还给你。\"说完，他拿出一只陈旧的钱袋，给了我一百六十个葡萄牙金币，又把他搭在新船上的四分之一股份和他儿子的四分之一股份一起开了一张出让证交给我，作为其余欠款的担保。 \n \n 那条船他儿子现在开往巴西去了。 \n \n 这位可怜的老人，心地这样正直善良，实在使我深受感动，我真不忍心听他讲下去了。想到他过去对我的好处，想到他把我从海上救起来，对我一直那么慷慨大度，特别是看到现在他对我的真诚善良，听着他的诉说，我禁不住流下了眼泪。于是，我首先问他，以他目前的经济状况，能不能拿出这么多钱？拿出来后会不会使他手头拮据？他告诉我说，拮据当然会拮据一些，但那是我的钱，而且，目前我比他更需要这笔钱。 \n \n 这位善良的老人所说的话，充满了真挚的友情。他一边说，我一边止不住流泪。一句话，我只拿了他一百块葡萄牙金币，并叫他拿出笔和墨水，写了一张收据给他，把其余的钱都退还给了他。我还对他说，只要我能够收回我的种植园，这一百块钱我也要还给他。这一点我后来确实也做到了。至于他在他儿子船上的股权出让证，我是无论如何也不能收的。 \n \n 我说，如果我要用钱，我相信他一定会给我的，因为我知道他是一个诚实的人。如果我不需要钱，我就再也不会向他要一文钱，因为，他认为，我完全有理由收回我所指望的产业。 \n \n 这些事情办完后，老人家又问我，是不是要他替我想个办法，把我的种植园收回来。我告诉他，我想亲自去巴西走一趟。他说，如果我想去，那也好。不过，如果我不想去，也有不少办法保证我收回自己的产权，并马上把收入拨给我使用。目前，在里斯本的特茹河里，正有一批船要开往巴西。 \n \n 他劝我在官方登记处注册了我的名字，他自己也写了一份担保书，宣誓证明我还活着，并声明当时在巴西领取土地建立种植园的正是我本人。 \n \n 我把老人的担保书按常规作了公证，又附上了一份委托书。然后，老人又替我写了一封亲笔信，连同上述两份文件，让我一起寄给了他所熟悉的一位巴西商人。这一切办完，他建议我住在他家里静候回音。 \n \n 这次委托手续真是办得再公正也没有了。不到七个月，我收到那两位代理人的财产继承人寄给我的一个大包裹。（应该提一下的是，我正是为了那两位代理人才从事这次遇难的航行的。）包里有下述信件和文件：第一，我种植园收入的流水账，时间是从他们父亲和这位葡萄牙老船长结算的那一年算起，一共是六年，应该给我一千一百七十四个葡萄牙金币。 \n \n 第二，在政府接管之前的账目，一共四年，这是他们把我作为失踪者（他们称之为\"法律上的死亡\"）保管的产业。 \n \n 由于种植园的收入逐年增加，这四年共结存三万八千八百九十二块葡萄牙银币，合三千二百四十一块葡萄牙金币；第三，圣奥古斯丁修道院长的账单。他已经获得十四年的收益。他十分诚实，告诉我说，除了医院方面用去的钱以外，还存八百七十二块葡萄牙金币。他现在把这笔钱记在我的账上。至于国王收去的部分，则不能再偿还了。 \n \n 另外，还有一封合股人写给我的信。他祝贺我还活在人世，言词十分诚挚亲切。他向我报告了我们产业发展的情况以及每年的生产情况，并详细谈到了我们的种植园现在一共有多少英亩土地，怎样种植，有多少奴隶等等。他在信纸上画了二十二个十字架，为我祝福。他还说，他念了无数遍以\"万福马利亚\"开头的祷词，为我活在人间感谢圣母马利亚。 \n \n 他热情地邀请我去巴西收回我的产业。同时，他还要我给他指示，若我不能亲自去巴西，他应把我的财产交给什么人。在信的末尾，他又代表他本人和全家向我表示他们的深厚情谊，又送给我七张精致的豹皮作为礼物。这些豹皮是他派往非洲的另一艘船给他带回来的；他们那次航行，看来比我幸运得多了。另外，他还送了我五箱上好的蜜饯，一百枚没有铸过的金元，那些金元比葡萄牙金币略小些。 \n \n 这一支船队还运来了我两位代理人的后代给我的一千二百箱糖，八百箱烟叶；同时，他们还把我账上所结存的全部财产折合成黄金金，也给我一起运来了。 \n \n 现在，我可以说，我犹如约伯，上帝赐给我的比从前更多了。当我读到这些信件，特别是当我知道我的全部财富都已安抵里斯本，我内心的激动实在难以言表。那些巴西的船队，向来是成群结队而来，同一支船队给我带来了信件，也同时运来了我的货物。当我读到信件的时候，我的财产也早已安抵里斯本的特茹河里了。总之，我脸色苍白，人感到非常难受。要不是他老人家急忙跑去给我拿了点提神酒来，我相信，这突如其来的惊喜，一定会使我精神失常，当场死去。 \n \n 不但如此，就是喝了提神酒之后，我仍感到非常难受，一直好几个小时。最后请来了一位医生。他问明了病因之后，就给我放了血。这才使我感到舒服了些，以后就慢慢好起来。我完全相信，如果我当时激动的情绪不是用这种方法排解的话，也许早就死了。 \n \n 突然间，我成了拥有五千英镑现款的富翁，而且在巴西还有一份产业，每年有一千镑以上的收入，就像在英国的田产一样可靠。一句话，我目前的处境，连自己也莫名其妙，更不知道如何安下心来享用这些财富了。 \n \n 我做的第一件事情，就是报答我最初的恩人，也就是那好心的老船长。当初我遇难时，他待我十分仁慈，此后自始至终对我善良真诚。我把收到的东西都给他看了。我对他说，我之所以有今天，除了主宰一切的天意外，全靠了他的帮助。 \n \n 现在，我既然有能力报答他，我就要百倍地回报他。我先把他给我的一百葡萄牙金币退还给他。然后，又请来了一位公证人，请他起草了一份字据，把老船长承认欠我的四百七十块葡萄牙金币，以最彻底、最可靠的方式全部取消或免除。这项手续完成之后，我又请他起草了一份委托书，委任老船长作为我那种植园的年息管理人，并指定我那位合股人向他报告账目，把我应得的收入交给那些长年来往于巴西和里斯本的船队带给他。委托书的最后一款是，老船长在世之日，每年从我的收入中送给他一百葡萄牙金币；在他死后，每年送给他儿子五十葡萄牙金币。这样，我总算报答了这位老人。 \n \n 我现在该考虑下一步的行动了，并考虑怎样处置上天赐给我的这份产业了。说实在话，与荒岛上的寂寞生活相比，现在我要操心的事更多了。在岛上，除了我所有的，就别无他求；除了我所需要的，也就一无所有。可现在我负有很大的责任，那就是如何保管好自己的财产。我不再有什么洞穴可以保藏我的钱币，也没有什么地方放钱可以不加锁；在岛上时，你尽可以放在那里，直到钱币生锈发霉也不会有人去动一动。而现在，我却不知道把钱放在哪里，也不知道托谁保管好。只有我的恩人老船长，是个诚实可靠的人，也是我唯一可以信托的人。 \n \n 另一方面，我在巴西的利益似乎需要我去一次。可是，如果我不把这儿的事料理好，把我的财产交托给可靠的人管理，我怎么能贸然前往呢？最初，我想到了我的老朋友，就是那位寡妇。我知道他为人诚实可靠，而且也一定不会亏待我。可是，现在她已上了年纪，又很穷；而且，据我所知，还负了债。所以，一句话，我没有别的办法，只有带着我的财产，自己亲自回英国了。 \n \n 然而，过了好几个月，才把这件事情决定下来。我现在已充分报答了我从前的恩人老船长，他也感到心满意足。所以，我开始想到那位可怜的寡妇了。他的丈夫是我的第一位恩人，而且，她本人在有能力时，一直是我忠实的管家，并尽长辈之责经常开导我。因此，我做的第一件事情是，我让一位在里斯本的商人写信给他在伦敦的关系人，除了请他替我把汇票兑成现款外，还请他亲自找到她，替我把一百英镑的现款亲自交给她。我还要此人当面和她谈一下，因为她目前非常贫困，境况不佳，所以我要此人好好安慰她，并告诉她，只要我活在人世，以后还会接济她。另外，我又给我那两个住在乡下的妹妹每人寄了一百。她们虽然并不贫困，但境况也不太好。一个妹妹结了婚，后来成了寡妇；另一个妹妹的丈夫对她很不好。 \n \n 可是，在我所有的亲戚朋友中，我还找不到一个可以完全信托的人，把我的全部财产交付给他保管，这样我自己可以放心到巴西去，毫无后顾之虑。这件事一直使我十分烦恼。 \n \n 我一度也曾想到过在巴西安家落户，因为我从前入过巴西籍。但是在宗教上我总有一点顾虑，使我不敢贸然作出决定。关于这个问题，我不久再会谈到，但当前，妨碍我前往的不是宗教问题。从前我在巴西的时候，已毫无顾忌地皈依了他们的宗教，现在当然更无所顾虑了。不过，最近我经常会考虑到这个问题，想到我将在他们中间生活和去世，我有点后悔当时我皈依了旧教天主教，并感到自己有点不甘心以旧教徒的身份死去。 \n \n 但是，我上面已说过，目前妨碍我前往巴西的不是什么宗教问题，而是我不知道该把我的财产托付给谁代管。所以，我决定带着我的钱和财产回英国去。到了那里，我相信一定可以结交一些朋友，或找到什么忠于我的亲戚。这样，我就决定带着我的全部财富回英国去。 \n \n 回国之前，当然先得把一些事情料理一下。开往巴西的船队马上要起航了，所以我决定先写几封回信，答复巴西方面寄给我的那些报告。应该说，他们的报告既忠实，又公正，所以，我的回信也应该写得十分得体。首先，我给圣奥古斯丁修道院院长写了一封回信，在信中，我对他们公正无私的办事态度充满了感激之情，并把那没有动用的八百七十二块葡萄牙金币全部捐献了出去，其中五百块金币捐给修道院，三百七十二块金币随院长意思捐给品民，并请他为我祈祷。 \n \n 接着，我又给两位代理人写了一封感谢信，赞扬他们公正无私、诚实忠诚的办事态度。我本想送他们一些礼物，可是一想他们什么也不缺，也就作罢了。 \n \n 最后，我又给我的合股人写了一封信，感谢他在发展我们的种植园工作上所付出的辛勤劳动，以及他在扩大工厂经营中所表现的廉洁精神。在信中，我对今后如何处置我的那部分资产作了指示，请他按我赋予老船长的权力，把我应得的收益寄给老船长。以后办法如有改变，我将会再详细通知他。同时，我还告诉他，我不仅会亲自去巴西看他，还打算在那里定居，度过我的余生。另外，我又送了一份丰厚的礼物给他的太太和两个女儿，因为老船长告诉我，他已有了家室。礼物中包括一些意大利丝绸，两匹英国细呢，那是我在里斯本市场上所能买到的最好的呢料，五匹黑色粗呢，以及一些价格昂贵的佛兰德斯花边。 \n \n 就这样，我把该料理的事情都办了，把货也卖出去了，又把我的钱财换成可靠的汇票，下一步的难题就是走哪一条路回英国。海路我是走惯了，可是这一次不知什么原因，我就是不想走海路。我不愿意从海路回英国，尽管我自己也说不出什么理由。这种想法越来越强烈，以至有两三次，我把行李都搬到船上了，可是还是临时改变了主意，重新把行李从船上搬了下来。 \n \n 我的航海生涯确实非常不幸，这也许是我不想再出海的理由之一。但在这种时候，任何人也不应忽视自己内心这种突然产生的念头。我曾特别挑选过两条船，本来我是决定要搭乘的。其中有一条，我把行李都搬上去了；另一条，我也都和船长讲定了。可是，最后我两条船都没有上。后来，那两条船果然都出事了。一条给阿尔及利亚人掳了去；另一条在托贝湾的斯塔特岬角沉没了，除了三个人生还，其他人都淹死了。反正不管我上哪条船，都得倒霉；至于上哪条船更倒霉，那就很难说了。 \n \n 我为这事心里烦透了，就去与老船长商量。他坚决反对我走海路，而劝我最好走陆路到拉科鲁尼亚，渡过比斯开湾到罗谢尔，再从罗谢尔走陆路到巴黎，既安全又舒适，然后再从巴黎到加来和多佛尔；或先到马德里，然后由陆路穿过法国。 \n \n 总之，我不想走海路已成了一种先入为主的想法，怎么也无法改变了；唯一我愿意坐船的一段路，就是从加来到多佛尔这段海路。现在，我既不想急于赶路，又不在乎花钱，所以就决定全部走陆路，而且陆上旅行实在也是很愉快的。为了使这次旅行更愉快，我的老船长又给我找了一位英国绅士为伴。此人是在里斯本的一位商人的儿子，他表示愿意和我结伴同行。后来我们又找到了两位英国商人和两位葡萄牙绅士，不过两位葡萄牙绅士的目的地是巴黎。这样，我们现在一共有六个旅伴和五个仆人；那两位英国商人和两位葡萄牙绅士为了节省开支，各共用一个听差。而我除了星期五之外，又找了一个英国水手当我路上的听差，因为星期五在这异乡客地，难以担当听差的职务。 \n \n 我们就这样从里斯本出发了。我们都骑着好马，全副武装，成了一支小小的部队。大家都很尊敬我，称我为队长，一来是我年纪最大，二来我有两个听差。再说，我也是这次旅行的发起人哩。 \n \n 前面，我没用我的航行日记使读者生厌；现在，我当然也不想用陆上旅行日记使读者厌烦了。但是，这趟旅行既疲劳又艰苦，期间也发生了几件险事，在这里不能不提一下。 \n \n 我们到了马德里之后，因为大家都第一次来到西班牙，所以都想逗留几天参观一下西班牙皇宫和其他值得观光的地方。但这时已近夏末秋初，我们不得不匆匆重新上路。离开马德里时，已是十月中旬了。可是，当我们到达纳瓦拉边境时，在沿路的几个小城镇里听到人们议论纷纷，说在法国境内的山上，已经大雪纷飞。几个冒险试图越过山区的旅客，都被迫返回了潘佩卢那。 \n \n 我们到达潘佩卢那后，发现情况确实如此。这么多年来，我一向过惯了热带气候，在那里连衣服也热得穿不上。可现在突然遇此严寒，实在使我有点受不了。尤其是，十天以前，我们才离开旧卡斯蒂利亚；那儿气候不仅温暖，甚至很热。 \n \n 现在，从比利牛斯山上一下子吹来一股寒风，冷得叫人受不了。我们的手脚都冻得麻木了，差点儿把手指头和脚趾头都冻掉。这突如其来的变化是出乎我们意料的，令我们非常苦恼。 \n \n 可怜的星期五一辈子没见过雪受过冻。现在忽然看见大雪封山，天寒地冻，简直把他吓坏了。 \n \n 更糟的是，我们到达潘佩卢那后，大雪一直下个不停。人们都说，今年冬天来得特别早。这一段路本来就不好走，现在更是无法通行了。有些地方积雪很深，寸步难行；而且，这一带的雪不像北方那样冻得结结实实的，而是很松软，因此走在上面随时有被活埋的危险。我们被阻在潘佩卢那不下二十天，眼看冬季已到来，天气没有转好的可能，因为这一年是人们记忆中欧洲最严寒的冬天。在此情况下，我提议我们应先到封塔拉比亚，然后再从那儿坐船到波尔多，那段海路不太远。 \n \n 正当我们在考虑另寻出路时，忽然来了四位法国绅士。他们曾经在法国境内的山路上被雪所阻，正像我们在这儿西班牙境内的山路上被雪所阻一样。但是，他们后来找到了一个向导，带他们绕过朗格多附近的山区，一路上没碰到什么大雪；即使在雪最多的地方，据他们说也冻得很硬，人和马通行是不成问题的。 \n \n \n \n 我们就把那位向导找了来。他对我们说，他愿意从原路把我们带过去，不会遇到大雪的阻碍，但我们必须多带武器，防备野兽的袭击，因为，他说，大雪过后，经常有些狼在山脚下出没。因为遍地大雪，它们找不到食物，已经饿慌了。我们告诉他，我们对狼这一类野兽已有充分的准备；不过，他能否保证我们不会遇到两条腿的狼，因为，我们听说，这一地区十分危险，经常会受到强人的抢劫，尤其是在法国境内。 \n \n 向导对我们说，在我们走的路上，没有强人袭击的危险。 \n \n 于是，我们马上同意跟他走。另外还有十二位绅士和他们的仆人决定和我们一起走。他们中间有法国人，也有西班牙人。 \n \n 我前面提到，这些人曾试图过境，但因大雪所阻，被迫折回来了。 \n \n 于是，在十一月十五日，我们一行全体人马跟着我们的向导，从潘佩卢那出发了。出乎我意料之外的是，他并不往前走，而是带我们倒回头来，朝我们从马德里来的那条路上走回去。这样走了大约二十多英里，然后渡过了两条河，来到了平原地带。这儿气候暖和起来，且风景明媚，看不见一点雪。可是，向导突然向左一转，从另一条路把我们带进了山区。这一路上尽是崇山峻岭，悬崖峭壁，看起来煞是可怕。 \n \n \n 可是，向导左转右转，曲折迂回，居然带着我们不知不觉地越过了最高的山头，路上并没有碰到什么大雪的困阻。突然，他叫我们向远处看，我们居然看到了风景美丽、物产丰富的朗格多省和加斯科尼剩只见那儿树木繁茂，一片葱绿，但距离还相当远。我们还得走一程歧岖艰难的山路，才能到达那儿。 \n \n 然而，使我们感到不安的是，这时下起了大雪，整整下了一天一夜，简直没法走路。向导叫我们放心，说我们不久即可通过这一地区。事实上，我们也发现，我们一天天地在下山，而且愈来愈往北走。因此，我们就跟着向导，继续前进。 \n \n 天黑前两小时，我们的向导远远走在我们的前面；当时，我们已看不到他的身影了。突然，从左边密林深处的山坳里，冲出来三只凶猛的大狼，后面还跟着一头熊。有两只狼直向我们的向导扑去。如果他离我们再远点，就早给狼吞掉了，我们也来不及救他了。这时，一只狼向他的马扑去，紧紧咬住了马；另一只向他本人扑去，使他措手不及，不仅来不及拔出手枪，甚至在慌乱中都没有想到要拔枪自卫，只是一个劲拼命朝我们大喊大叫。这时，星期五正在我的身旁。我就命令他策马向前，看看究竟发生了什么事。星期五一见到向导，也像向导一样大叫起来：\"主人！主人！\"但他毕竟是个勇敢的男子汉，立即催马冲到向导跟前，拿起手枪，对着那只狼的头上就是一枪，结果了那畜牲的生命。 \n \n 可怜的向导应该说运气不错，因为他碰上了星期五。星期五在他家乡与野兽打惯了交道，所以一点也不害怕。他能坦然地走到狼的跟前，一枪把它打死。要是换了别人，就不敢靠得那么近开枪了。而从远距离开枪，不是打不着狼，就是可能打着人。 \n \n 即使像我这样胆大的人，见此情景也着实吓得心惊肉跳。 \n \n 说实在的，我们一行人都吓得魂不附体，因为，紧跟着星期五的枪声，我们就听见两边的狼群发出一起最凄惨的嚎叫，山谷里又发出阵阵回声，结果狼嚎和回声此起彼伏，犹如成千上万的狼在吼叫。说不定来的狼确实也不止这几只，要不，我们也不至如此惊恐万状了。 \n \n 星期五打死了那只狼之后，另一只本来紧咬着马不放，登时也松了嘴逃跑了。幸亏这只狼咬住了马头，马勒头上的铁圈刚刚卡住了狼的牙齿，因而马没有受什么伤。可是向导的伤可不轻，因为那只激怒了的野兽一共咬了他两口，一口咬在肩膀上，一口咬在他膝头上方。而且，当星期五上前把狼打死时，他那匹受惊的马几乎把他摔了下来。 \n \n 不用说，一听到星期五的枪声，我们立即催马向前。尽管道路很难走，我们还是快马加鞭，想看看前面到底发生了什么情况。我们一转出挡住视线的小树林，就把情况看得一清二楚，并亲眼看到星期五怎样救了那位可怜的向导，但当时我们还看不清楚他打死的究竟是只什么野兽。 \n \n 紧接着，星期五和那只大熊之间展开了一场最大胆、最惊人的大战。这场大战起初确实使我们胆战心惊，最后却使大家开怀大笑。熊的身体笨重，行动蹒跚，跑起来当然没有狼那样轻快。因此，他的行动有两个特点。第一，对人来说，他一般不把人当作猎食的对象；当然，像现在这样大雪遍地，极端饥饿的时候，这笨拙的大家伙是否也会吃人，那就很难说了。一般来说，要是在树林里遇到熊，你不去惹它，它也不会来惹你。不过，你得特别小心，要对它客气，给它让路，因为它是一位特别难以取悦的绅士，即使是一位王子走来，它也不肯让路。如果你真的害怕，最好不要看它，继续走你的路。如果你停下来，站着正视它，熊就认为是对它的侮辱。如果你向它丢点什么东西，打中了它，哪怕是一根小小的树枝，只有你手指头那么粗，熊也认为是一种侮辱。这时，它会把一切丢开不管，一心只想报仇，不达目的决不罢休。这有关它的荣誉问题，它一定要把面子挣回来才算满足。这是熊的第一个特点。第二个特点是，熊一旦受到侮辱，就会不分昼夜地跟着你，一直到报了仇才罢休，哪怕绕上许多路，也要赶上你，抓住你。 \n \n 星期五救了向导的性命。当我们走上去的时候，他正在帮助向导下马，因为向导受了伤，又受了惊吓，而且，看来惊恐甚于伤势。这时，那只熊突然从树林里出来了。这只熊身躯异常庞大，是我生气所看到的最大的熊。我们大家一见，都有点恐慌，可是星期五见到它，反而喜形于色，显出精神百倍的神气。\"啊！啊！啊！\"他一连叫了三声，又指着熊对我说，\"主人，你允许我吧！我要和它握握手，我要叫你们乐一乐！\"我看到这家伙如此兴高采烈，不免出乎意料。\"你这傻瓜， \n \n \"我说，\"它要吃掉你的！\"\"吃掉我！吃掉我！\"星期五一连说了两遍，\"我还要吃掉它哩！我要让你们乐一乐。你们都站开。我要让你们乐一乐！\"于是他坐在地上，脱下靴子，换上一双便鞋。这是一种皮底鞋，他衣袋里正好有一双。他把马交给听差，然后带着他的枪，一阵风似地飞快跑了过去。 \n \n 那只熊正慢条斯理地向前走，看起来不想惹任何人。可是星期五走到它跟前，向它打招呼，好像熊能听懂他的话似的。\"你听着，你听着，\"他说，\"我在跟你说话哩！\"我们远远跟在后面。这时我们已走下了山，进入了山这边的加斯科尼剩这儿地势平坦开阔，到处是树木。我们进入了一片大森林。 \n \n \n 星期五追上了那只熊，捡起一块大石头向它丢去，正好打在熊的头上。当然，这一点也没伤着它，就像打在一座墙上。可是这样一来，星期五的目的达到了，星期五这家伙简直毫无畏惧，他这样做纯粹是挑，好惹那只熊来追他，照他的说法是逗我们\"乐一乐\"！ \n \n 那只熊感觉到有石头打它，并看见了星期五，登时转身向星期五追来。那熊迈开大步，摇摇摆摆，跑得飞快，差不多和马小跑一样快。星期五撒腿就跑，仿佛向我们这边跑来求援似的。于是大家决定向熊开枪，救我的人。但我心里非常生气。因为那熊本来好端端地在走它的路，并没有要惹我们，尤其使我生气的是，他把熊引向我们这儿来，自己却跑掉了。于是我高声叫道：\"你这狗东西，你就这样让我们乐一乐吗？快走开，牵上你的马，我们可以开枪打死这畜牲。\"他听到了我的话，就叫起来：\"别打，别打！站着不要动，好戏在后面哪！\"星期五生就一双飞毛腿，他跑两步，熊才跑一步。 \n \n 突然，他一转身，从我们旁边跑开，看到那边有一棵大橡树正合他的需要，就向我们招手，叫我们跟上去。同时，他跑得更快，把枪放在离树根大约五六码的地上，自己敏捷地爬上了树。 \n \n 熊也很快跑到树下，我们一行则远远地跟在后面。那熊先在枪边停了下来闻了闻那支枪，没有去动它，就往树上爬。 \n \n 虽然那家伙身子笨重，但爬起树来像猫一样灵活。我对星期五的这种愚蠢行为深为惊愕，一点也看不出有什么好笑的地方。我们看到熊已经上了树，也一起策马向前。 \n \n 当我们来到大树跟前时，星期五已爬到一根树枝的枝梢上，那根树枝长长地向外伸展。这时，那熊也上了那树枝。它沿着树枝向外爬，越向外爬，树枝就越细越软。\"哈，\"星期五对我们说，\"现在你们看我教熊跳舞。\"于是他在那支树枝上大跳大摇，弄得那熊摇摇欲坠，只好站住不动，并开始往后回顾，看看怎样能爬回去。我们看到这样子，果然都开怀大笑起来。但星期五玩熊才刚刚开个头呢。他看到那熊站着不动了，就又去招呼它，仿佛相信熊也能讲英语似的。\"嗨，怎么啦！你不过来了？请你再朝前走吧！\"于是，他不再摇摆树枝了。那只熊也似乎明白他的话似的，又向前爬了几步。于是，星期五又开始大跳大摇，那熊又站住了。 \n \n 我们认为，这时正好可以向熊头上开一枪，把它打死。于是就叫星期五站着别动，我们要打熊了。可是星期五大声叫着求我们：\"喔，请不要开枪，等会儿我会开枪的。\"好吧，现在长话短说，星期五又在树枝上大跳大摇了一阵子，那只熊爬在上面，东倒西摇，引得我们大家都笑了个够。可是，我们都不知道星期五玩的是什么鬼把戏。起初，我们以为星期五要把熊从树枝上摇下来，可是，我们看得出，那熊也相当狡猾，不肯上当，它再也不肯往前多走一步，怕自己被摇下来，只是一个劲地用它那又宽又大的脚掌紧紧地抓住树枝。所以，我们不知道这件事将会有什么结局，也想象不出这场玩笑最后会如何结束。 \n \n 但星期五很快就解开了我们的疑团。他见那熊紧抓树枝，不肯往前挪动一步，就说：\"好吧，好吧，你不走，我走，我走。你不到我这儿来，我到你那儿去。\"说完，他爬到树枝的末梢，那地方只要用他的体重一压，就会垂下来。他轻轻从树枝上滑下来，等到他离地不远时，一下子就跳到地上，飞也似地向他的枪跑过去，把枪拿在手里，站在那里一动也不动。 \n \n \"唔，\"我对他说，\"星期五，你现在想干什么？为什么你不开枪打死它？\"\"不打，\"星期五说：\"还不打。现在不开枪，我不打它。我呆在这儿，再让你们乐一下。\"不久，我们就看到，他真的这样干了。因为那熊见他的敌人走了，也就从它站着的树枝上往后退。但它往回走的时候极其从容不迫，每走一步，都要回头看一下。退着退着，它终于退到树干上来。 \n \n 然后，它还是倒着身子，从树干上往下爬；它脚掌紧抓树干，一步一步地往下退，依旧是那样从容。就在那熊的后腿刚要落地，星期五一步赶上去，把枪口塞进它的耳朵，一枪就把它打死了。 \n \n 这时候，星期五这家伙转过身来，看看我们有没有笑。他看到我们都喜形于色，他自己也哈哈大笑起来。\"我们那里就是这样杀熊的。\"星期五说。\"你们真的是这样杀的吗？\"我问，\"你们没有枪怎么杀啊？\"\"没有，\"他说，\"没有枪，我们用箭射，很长很长的箭。\"星期五的游戏对我们来说确实是一场很好的消遣。可是，我们现在还在荒山野地里，向导又受了重伤，真不知怎么办才好。刚才狼群的嚎叫声还一直在我的耳际回响。说实话，除了我有一次在非洲海岸听到过的那些野兽的吼叫声之外，还从来没有听到过任何声音使我这样毛骨悚然。关于非洲海岸的那次经历，我前面曾叙述过了。 \n \n 由于上述这些情况，再加上天快黑了，我们便不得不匆匆离开。不然的话，依星期五的意思，我们一定会把那巨熊的皮剥下来，那是很值钱的。可是，我们还要赶九英里的路，向导也一直催我们快走，我们只好丢开那只熊，继续往前赶路。 \n \n 地上仍有积雪，不过没有山里那么深，因而走起来也不那么危险了。后来，我们听说，那些凶猛的野兽由于饿急了，都从山上下来跑到树林和平原上来寻找食物。它们袭击村庄和居民，咬死许多羊和马，甚至还伤了一些人。 \n \n 向导对我们说，我们还要经过一个危险的地方。如果这一带还有狼的话，我们一定会在那里碰到。那地方是一片小小的平川地，四周都是树林。要想穿过树林，就必须走一条又长又窄的林间小道，然后才能到达我们将要宿夜的村庄。 \n \n 当我们进入第一座树林时，离太阳落山仅半小时了，到我们进入那片平川，太阳已经下去了。在第一座树林里，我们什么也没有碰见，只在一块二百来码长宽的林间空地上，看见有五条大狼，一条跟着一条，飞快地在路上越过，大概是在追赶一个什么小动物吧，因为那小动物就在他们前面。那些狼没有注意到我们，不到一会儿，就跑得无影无踪了。 \n \n 我们的向导本来就是一个胆小如鼠的人。他看到这情景，就嘱咐我们早作准备，因为，他相信，一定会来更多的狼。 \n \n 我们手里紧握着枪，眼睛紧盯着四面八方。可是在我们穿过那座一英里多长的树林，进入平川地以前，再也没有看见过别的狼。等我们一进入平川，向四下一望，头一眼就见到一匹死马。这是一匹被狼群咬死的马，同时见到至少有十二条狼在那里大吃特吃；其实，马肉早就给它们吃光了，现在正在啃马骨头呢！ \n \n 我们感到不应该去打扰它们的盛宴，何况它们也没有注意我们。星期五本来想向它们开枪，可是我怎么也不同意。因为我感到，我们的麻烦还在后面呢，尽管我们现在还不知道。 \n \n 我们在那片平川地上还没走上一半的路，就听到左边森林里此起彼落的狼叫声，令人胆颤心惊。不一会儿，就看见上百只狼一窝蜂似地向我们扑来。那些狼都排成单行，就像一位有经验的军官所带的部队一样整齐。我简直不知道如何对付它们。结果，我认为最好的办法是我们互相靠拢，排成一行。 \n \n 于是，我们马上照此行事。为了不致使我们的火力中断太久，我下令只许一半人开枪，另一半人作好准备；如果第一排枪响过后，狼群继续向我们冲来，就开第二排枪；同时，在开第二排枪时，那开第一排枪的一半人，不要忙于装他们的长枪，而是应该抽出手枪，作好准备。因为我们每人身上都有一支长枪和两支手枪。用这种办法，我们可以连续开六排枪，每次有一半人开枪。然而，当时还没有必要这样做。放出第一排枪之后，我们的敌人就给枪声和火光吓坏了，马上停止了前进。有四条狼被我们打中头部，倒了下来；另外有几条受了伤，鲜血淋淋地跑掉了。这在雪地上可以看得一清二楚。 \n \n 我发现，狼群停止了攻击，但没有后退。这时，我忽然记起有人说过，就是最凶猛的野兽，听见人的声音也会害怕。于是我就叫大家拼命呐喊。这个办法果然很有效。我们一喊，狼群就开始后退，掉头跑掉了。我又下令朝它们背后开了一排枪。这样一来，它们才撒腿跑回树林里去了。 \n \n 这时，我们才有时间重新给枪装上弹药。同时，我们抓紧时间继续前进。可是，我们刚装好枪准备上路时，又从左边原来的那座树林里传出了可怕的嚎叫声。这一次狼群离我们较远，但却在我们去路的正前方。 \n \n 黑夜来临了，光线变得暗淡起来。这对我们更加不利。叫声越来越响，我们不难辩别出，那是恶狼的嚎叫。突然，出现了两三群狼。一群在我们左边，一群在我们后边，还有一群在我们前面，看样子已经把我们包围起来了。我们见狼群并没有向我们进攻，就催马继续前进。可是路很难走，只能让马小跑着。跑着跑着，便看见远处有一个森林的进口，我们非得穿过那片树林，才能走到这片平川的尽头。当我们走进那林间小道时，只见那路口站着数不胜数的狼。这不禁使我们大吃一惊。 \n \n 突然，在树林的另一个入口处，我们听见一声枪响。向左边一看，只见一匹马从树林里冲出来，一阵风似地向前飞奔。马上的马勒马鞍均完好无损。同时有十六、七只狼，飞快地在后面追着。当然，马要比狼跑得快得多，它把狼群远远地丢在后面。可是，问题是那匹马不可能支持太久，最后必然会给狼群追上。 \n \n 正当此时，我们又看到了一幅可怕的景象。当我们催马走近那匹马奔出来的路口时，见到了一匹马和两个人的尸骸，毫无疑问是给狼咬死吃掉的。其中一个人身边还丢看一支枪，枪是放过的，所以一定就是刚才开枪的人。现在，他的头和上半身都已给狼吃掉了。 \n \n 看到这副惨状，我们都不禁心惊肉跳，不知如何办才好。 \n \n 但那群野兽不久就逼得我们不得不采取行动。这时，狼群已把我们包围，想以我们一行人马果腹。我相信，一共有三百来只。值得庆幸的是，在离树林入口处不远，正好堆着一大批木料，大概是夏天采伐下来堆在那里预备运走的。这对我们的行动非常有利。我把我这一小队人马开到那堆木料后面。 \n \n 那儿有一根木头特别长，我就把队伍在那根长木头后面一字排开。我让大家都下马，把那根长木头当作胸墙，站成一个三角形或三边形的阵线，把我们的马围在中央。 \n \n 我们这样做了，而且也幸亏这样做了。因为这群饿狼向我们发动了攻击，其凶猛程度在狼害为患的当地也是罕见的。 \n \n 它们嚎叫着向我们扑来，窜上了那根长木头。前面我已提到，我们以此长木头作为胸墙。它们的目的只有一个，就是扑向猎物。从它们的行动判断，其目标主要是我们身后的那些马匹。我命令我的队伍像上次那样分两批开火，一人隔一人放枪。他们都瞄得很准。第一排子弹开出去，就打死了好几只狼。可是，我们不得不连续开火。这批恶狼忧如恶魔一样，前仆后继，不知死活地向前猛冲。 \n \n 第二排枪放完后，我们以为狼群暂时停止了进攻，我也希望它们已经逃走。但一会儿，后面的狼又冲上来了。我们又放了两排手枪子弹。这样，我们一共放了四排枪。我相信，至少打死了十七、八只狼，打伤的大约多一倍。可是，它们还是蜂拥而来。 \n \n 我不愿匆匆放完最后一排枪，就叫来了自己的仆人。我没有叫星期五，而是叫了我新雇的那个水手。星期五有更重要的任务要完成。在我们开火的时候，他以惊人的速度给我和他自己的枪装弹药。所以我说，我叫的是新雇的仆人。我给了他一角火药，命令他沿着那根长木头把火药撒下去，撒成一条宽宽长长的火药线。他照着办了。他刚转身回来，狼群就冲了过来，有几只甚至已冲上了那根长木。我立即抓起一支没有放过的手枪，贴近火药线开了一枪，使火药燃烧起来。冲上木料的几只狼给烧伤了；其中有六、七只由于火光的威力和惊恐，竟连跌带跳地落入我们中间。我们立即把它们解决了。其他的狼被火光吓得半死，加上这时天已黑下来，火光看起来就更可怕了，这才使那些狼后退了几步。 \n \n \n 这时，我就下令全体人员用手枪一起开火，那是我们剩下的最后一批没有放过的手枪。然后大家齐声呐喊。这才使那些狼掉转尾巴逃跑了。于是我们马上冲到那二十多只受伤狼跟前；它们已跑不动了，只是在地上挣扎。我们拿起刀乱砍乱杀。正如我们所预期的那样，这办法果然很奏效，因为那些逃跑的狼听到它们同伴的惨叫声，知道事情不妙，就吓得跑远了，而且再也没有回来。 \n \n 我们一共打死了六十多只狼。要是在白天，我们也许能杀死更多。扫清了敌人，就继续前进。我们还要赶三英里的路。在路上，有好几次，听到饿狼在森林里嚎叫咆哮。有时，好像还看到几只狼的身影，但因雪光耀眼，不敢十分肯定。大约又过了半小时，我们才到了预定要过夜的那个小镇。到了那里，发现全镇人个个惊恐万状，并全副武装。原来昨天晚上，有不少狼和几只熊侵入了村子，把人们吓坏了，只好昼夜巡逻守卫；尤其是夜里，更要严加把守，保护牲畜，更要保卫全体居民。 \n \n 第二天早晨，向导的病势加重了；他的两处伤口化脓，因而四肢都肿胀起来，根本无法上路。我们只得雇了一个新向导，把我们带到土鲁斯。那儿气候温和，物产丰富，风景明媚，既没有雪，也没有狼或其他猛兽。当我们在土鲁斯把我们的经历告诉那些当地人时，他们对我们说，在山下大森林里，碰到狼是常事，尤其是当白雪覆盖大地，狼就成群出现。 \n \n 他们再三问我们，我们雇了哪个向导，竟敢在大雪天带我们走这条路。他们说，我们没有给狼吃掉，真是万幸！我们告诉他们，我们是把马围在中间，摆成一个三角形的阵势打退狼群的。他们听了后大大责怪了我们一阵子，说我们没有把命送掉，真是运气。狼主要是想吃马。它们之所以那样奋不顾身冲上来，是由于看到了我们身后的马。一般来说，狼是怕枪的，但当它们饿疯时，就会不顾危险，只想抢马吃了。要不是我们连续开枪，并且最后用点燃火药的办法把他们吓退，我们大概早就给那些饿狼撕成碎片吃掉了。其实，只要我们安安稳稳地坐在马上，像骑兵那样向狼群开枪，它们看到马上有人，就不会把马看作猎物了。最后，他们又说，如果我们大家紧挨在一起，丢开我们的马，狼就一心只想吃马而不会管我们，我们也可平安通过，更何况我们有武器，而且人多势众。 \n \n 对我来说，这次遇险，是我一生中最可怕的一次。当时，我看到三百多个恶魔般的畜牲嚎叫着向我们冲来，张开大嘴恨不得一口把我们吞掉，而我们又无处可躲，无处可退，我以为一定完蛋了。说实在的，从此我再也不想过那些山了。我觉得宁可在海上航行三千海里，那怕一星期遇上一次风暴，也比过那些荒山野岭强。 \n \n 在法国的旅程，一路上没有什么特别的事情可记；即使有，也不过是许多其他旅行家已记过的事，而且他们肯定比我记得好得多。我从土鲁斯到巴黎，一路马不停蹄，直达加莱。随后，在一月十四日，平安渡过海峡到达多佛尔。这整整一个最严寒的冬季，我就在旅行中度过了。 \n \n 现在我已抵达旅行的终点了。在短短的几天里，我兑现了带来的几张汇票；我新获得的财产，也都安全地转到了我的手上。 \n \n 我的长辈和良师益友，就是那位心地善良的老寡妇。她衷心感激我汇给她的钱；因此，她不辞劳苦，对我关怀备至，尽心尽力为我服务。我对她也是一百个放心，把所有的财产都交托给她保管。这位善良的、有教养的女人，确实品德高尚，廉洁无瑕，我对她自始至终都非常满意。 \n \n 当时，我打算把我的财产交给这位妇人代管，我自己出发去里斯本，再从那里去巴西。但这时我有了另一个顾虑，那就是宗教问题。早在国外时，尤其是我在荒岛上过着那种孤寂的生活时，我对罗马天主教就产生了怀疑。因此，我若想去巴西，甚至想在那里定居，在我面前只有两种选择：要么我决定毫无保留地信奉罗马天主教，要么我决定为自己的宗教思想献出生命，作为殉教者在宗教法庭上被判处死刑。所以，我就决定仍住在本国，而且，如果可能的话，把我在巴西的种植园卖掉。 \n \n 为此，我写了一封信给我在里斯本的那位老朋友。他回信告诉我，他可以很容易地在那儿把我在巴西的种植园卖掉。 \n \n 我若同意委托他经办此事，他可以以我的名义通知住在巴西的那两位商人，也就是我那两位代理人的儿子。他们住在当地，一定知道那份产业的价值，而且，我也知道他们很有钱。 \n \n 所以，他相信，他们一定会乐意买下来。他也毫不怀疑，我至少可以多卖四五千葡萄牙金币。我同意让他通知他们。他也照办了。大约八个月之后，去巴西的那艘船又回到了里斯本。他写信告诉我，他们接受了我的卖价，并已经汇了三万三千葡萄牙金币给他们在里斯本的代理人，嘱咐他照付。 \n \n 我在他们从里斯本寄给我的卖契上签了字，并把契约寄回给在里斯本的我那位老朋友。他给我奇来了一张三万二千八百块葡萄牙金币的汇票，那是我出卖那份产业所得的钱。我仍然履行了我先前许下的诺言，每年付给这位老人一百块葡萄牙金币，直到他逝世；并在他死后，每年付给他儿子五十块葡萄牙金币作为他终身津贴。原先这笔钱是我许诺从种植园的每年收益中支取的。 \n \n 现在，我叙述完了我一生幸运和冒险经历的第一部分。我这一生犹如造物主的杰作，光怪陆离，浮沉不定，变化无常，实乃人间罕见。虽然开始时我显得那么愚昧无知，但结局却比我所期望的要幸运得多。 \n \n 我现在可谓是福星高照，佳运交集。在这种情况下，任何人都以为我不会再出去冒险了。如果情况不是像后来发生的那样，我也确实会在家安享余年。可是，我现在的情况是，自己已过惯了游荡的生活，加上我目前一无家庭牵连，二无多少亲戚，而且，我虽富有，却没有结交多少朋友。所以，尽管我把在巴西的种植园已经出卖，可是我还常常想念那个地方，很想旧地重访，再作远游。我尤其想到我的岛上去看看，了解一下那批可怜的西班牙人是否上了岛，我留在岛上的那批坏蛋又是怎样对待他们的。这种出自内心的渴望，十分强烈，使我难以自制。 \n \n 我忠实的朋友，就是那位寡妇，竭力劝我不要再外出远游了。她真的把我劝住了。整整七年，她都不让我出游。在这期间，我领养了我的两个侄儿，他俩都是我一个哥哥的孩子。大侄儿本来有点遗产，我把他培养成了一个有教养的人，并且拨给他一点产业，在我死后并入他的财产。我把另一个侄儿托付给一位船长。五年后，我见他已成了一个通情达理、有胆识、有抱负的青年，就替他买了一条好船，让他航海去了。后来，正是这位小青年竟把我这个老头子拖进了新的冒险事业。 \n \n 在此期间，我在国内也初步安居下来。首先，我结了婚。 \n \n 这个婚姻不算太美满，也不算不美满。我生了三个孩子：两个儿子和一个女儿。可是，不久我妻子就过世了。这时，我的侄子又正好从西班牙航海归来，获利甚丰。我出洋的欲望又强烈起来，加上我侄儿一再劝说，于是，我就以一个私家客商的身份，搭他的船到东印度群岛去。这是一六九四年的事。 \n \n 在这次航行中，我回到了我的岛上。现在，这座小岛已是我的新殖民地了。我看到了我的那些继承人--就是那批大陆上过去的西班牙人，了解了他们的生活情况以及我留在岛上的那几个恶棍的情况，知道他们起初怎样侮辱那批可怜的西班牙人，后来又怎样时而和好，时而不和，时而联合，时而分开；最后那批西班牙人又怎样被迫使用武力对付他们，把他们制服，以及那批西班牙人又怎样公正地对待他们。他们的这段经历如果写出来，也会像我自己的经历一样光怪陆离，变化多端，尤其是他们同加勒比人打仗的故事，更是惊险异常。那些加勒比土人曾三番五次地登上海岛。他们也谈到了岛上生产发展和生活改善情况，以及他们怎样派了五个人攻到大陆上去，虏来了十一个男人和五个女人。所以，当我这次重访小岛时，那儿已经有了二十来个孩子。 \n \n 我在岛上逗留了大约二十天，给他们留下了各种日用必需品，特别是枪支弹药、衣服和工具，以及我从英国带来的两个工人--一个是木匠，另一个是铁匠。 \n \n 另外，我把全岛领土加以划分后分配给他们，我自己保留全岛的主权。我根据他们的要求，把土地一一分给他们。这样，我替他们解决了土地的归属问题，并嘱咐他们不要离开小岛，我自己就离开了。 \n \n 从那儿，我到了巴西。在巴西，我买了一条帆船，又送了一些人到岛上去。在那条船上，除了一些应用物品外，又给他们送了七个妇女去。这七个妇女都是经我亲自挑选的，有的适于干活，有的适于做老婆，只要那边有人愿意娶她们。至于那几个英国人，只要他们愿意在岛上勤于耕作，我答应从英国给他们送几个女人和大批的日用必需品去。这些诺言我后来也都实践了。这几个人被制服后，分到了土地，后来都成了诚实勤劳的人。我还从巴西给他们送去了五条母牛，其中有三条已怀了小牛，另外还有几只羊和几头猪。后来我再去时，那儿已是牛羊成群了。 \n \n 除了这些事情外，后来还发生了不少惊险的遭遇。三百来个加勒比土著曾入侵海岛，破坏了他们的种植园。他们曾两次与这些野人作战，起先被野人打败了，死了三个人。后来，刮起了风暴，摧毁了土著的独木舟；其余的野人不是饿死就是被消灭了，这样才重新收复了种植园，继续在岛上过日子。 \n \n 所有这些事情，以及我个人后来十多年的惊险遭遇，我可能以后再一一叙述。 \n \n
