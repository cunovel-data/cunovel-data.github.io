{"id":45224,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"When I was deliver\u0027d and taken up at Sea by the Portugal Captain, well us\u0027d, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the least Thankfulness on my Thoughts: When again I was shipwreck\u0027d, ruin\u0027d, and in Danger of drowning on this Island, I was as far from Remorse, or looking on it as a Judgment; I only said to my self often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and born to be always miserable. It is true, when I got on Shore first here, and found all my Ship\u0027s Crew drown\u0027d, and my self spar\u0027d, I was surpriz\u0027d with a Kind of Extasie, and some Transports of Soul, which, had the Grace of God assisted, might have come up to true Thankfulness; but it ended where it begun, in a meer common Flight of Joy, or as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least Reflection upon the distinguishing Goodness of the Hand which had preserv\u0027d me, and had singled me out to be preserv\u0027d, when all the rest were destroy\u0027d; or an Enquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me; even just the same common Sort of Joy which Seamen generally have after they are got safe ashore from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the next Bowl of Punch, and forget earted in the Sense of my miserable Condition; dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day; at Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle\u0027s Eggs, which I roasted in the Ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the Shell; and this was the first Bit of Meat I had ever ask\u0027d God\u0027s Blessing to, even as I cou\u0027d remember, in my whole Life. \\n\\n \\n\\n After I had eaten, I try\u0027d to walk, but found my self so weak, that I cou\u0027d hardly carry the Gun, (for I never went out without that) so I went but a little Way, and sat down upon the Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth: As I sat here, some such Thoughts as these occurred to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much, whence is it produc\u0027d, and what am I, and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane and brutal, whence are we? \\n\\n \\n\\n Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who form\u0027d the Earth and Sea, the Air and Skyd?B àmov\u0027d, all the Impression which was rais\u0027d from it, wore off also, as I have noted already. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even the Earthquake, tho\u0027 nothing could be more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such Things, yet no sooner was the first Fright over, but the Impression it had made went off also. I had no more Sense of God or his Judgments, much less of the present Affliction of my Circumstances being from his Hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous Condition of Life. \\n\\n \\n\\n But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely View of the Miseries of Death came to place itself before me; when my Spirits began to sink under the Burthen of a strong Distemper, and Nature was exhausted with the Violence of the Feaver; Conscience that had slept so long, begun to awake, and I began to reproach my self with my past Life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon Wickedness, provok\u0027d the Justice of God to lay me under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a Manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n These Reflections oppress\u0027d me for the second or third Day of my Distemper, and in the Violence, as well of the Feaver, as of the dreadful Reproaches of my Conscience, extorted some Words from me, like praying to God, tho\u0027 I cannot say they were either a Prayer attended with Desires or with Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright and Distress; my Thoughts were confus\u0027d, the Convictions great upon my Mind, and the Horror of dying in such a miserable Condition rais\u0027d Vapours into my Head with the meer Apprehensions; and in these Hurries of my Soul, I know not what my Tongue might express: but it was rather Exclamation, such as, Lord! what a miserable Creature am I? If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for Want of Help, and what will become of me! Then the Tears burst out of my Eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. \\n\\n \\n\\n In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father came to my Mind, and presently his Prediction which I mention\u0027d at the Beginning of this Story, viz. That if I did take this foolish Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his Counsel, when there might be none to assist in my Recovery. Now, said I aloud, My dear Father\u0027s Words are come to pass: God\u0027s Justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me: I rejected the Voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a Posture or Station of Life, wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it my self, or learn to know the Blessing of it from my Parents; I left them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left to mourn under the Consequences of it: I refus\u0027d their Help and Assistance who wou\u0027d have lifted me into the World, and wou\u0027d have made every Thing easy to me, and now I have Difficulties to struggle with, too great for even Nature itself to support, and no Assistance, no Help, no Comfort, no Advice; then I cry\u0027d out, Lord be my Help, for I am in great Distress. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was the first Prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many Years: But 1 return to my Journal. \\n\\n \\n\\n June 28. Having been somewhat refresh\u0027d with the Sleep I had had, and the Fit being entirely off, I got up; and tho\u0027 the Fright and Terror of my Dream was very great, yet I consider\u0027d, that the Fit of the Ague wou\u0027d return again the next Day, and now was my Time to get something to refresh and support my self when I should be ill; and the first Thing I did, I fill\u0027d a large square Case Bottle with Water, and set it upon my Table, in Reach of my Bed; and to take off the chill or aguish Disposition of the Water, I put about a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mix\u0027d them together; then I got me a Piece of the Goat\u0027s Flesh, and broil\u0027d it on the Coals, but could eat very little; I walk\u0027d about, but was very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the Sense of my miserable Condition; dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day; at Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle\u0027s Eggs, which I roasted in the Ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the Shell; and this was the first Bit of Meat I had ever ask\u0027d God\u0027s Blessing to, even as I cou\u0027d remember, in my whole Life. \\n\\n \\n\\n After I had eaten, I try\u0027d to walk, but found my self so weak, that I cou\u0027d hardly carry the Gun, (for I never went out without that) so I went but a little Way, and sat down upon the Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth: As I sat here, some such Thoughts as these occurred to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much, whence is it produc\u0027d, and what am I, and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane and brutal, whence are we? \\n\\n \\n\\n Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who form\u0027d the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky; and who is that? \\n\\n \\n\\n Then it follow\u0027d most naturally, It is God that has made it all: Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these Things, He guides and governs them all, and all Things that concern them; for the Power that could make all Things, must certainly have Power to guide and direct them. \\n\\n \\n\\n If so, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of his Works, either without his Knowledge or Appointment. \\n\\n \\n\\n And if nothing happens without his Knowledge, he knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful Condition; and if nothing happens without his Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal me. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing occurr\u0027d to my Thought to contradict any of these Conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater Force, that it must needs be, that God had appointed all this to befal me; that I was brought to this miserable Circumstance by his Direction, he having the sole Power, not of me only, but of every Thing that happen\u0027d in the World. Immediately it follow\u0027d, \\n\\n \\n\\n Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus us\u0027d? \\n\\n \\n\\n My Conscience presently check\u0027d me in that Enquiry, as if I had blasphem\u0027d, and methought it spoke to me like a Voice; WRETCH! dost thou ask what thou hast done! look back upon a dreadful mis-spent Life, and ask thy self what thou hast not done? ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago destroy\u0027d? Why wert thou not drown\u0027d in Yarmouth Roads? Kill\u0027d in the Fight when the Ship was taken by the Sallee Man of War? Devour\u0027d by the wild Beasts on the Coast of Africa? Or, Drown\u0027d HERE, when all the Crew perish\u0027d but thy self? Dost thou ask, What have I done? \\n\\n \\n\\n I was struck dumb with these Reflections, as one astonish\u0027d, and had not a Word to say, no not to answer to my self, but rise up pensive and sad, walk\u0027d back to my Retreat, and went up over my Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my Thoughts were sadly disturb\u0027d, and I had no Inclination to Sleep; so I sat down in my Chair, and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark: Now as the Apprehension of the Return of my Distemper terrify\u0027d me very much, it occurr\u0027d to my Thought, that the Brasilians take no Physick but their Tobacco, for almost all Distempers; and I had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the Chests, which was quite cur\u0027d, and some also that was green and not quite cur\u0027d. \\n\\n \\n\\n I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this Chest I found a Cure, both for Soul and Body, I open\u0027d the Chest, and found what I look\u0027d for, viz. the Tobacco; and as the few Books, I had sav\u0027d, lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mention\u0027d before, and which to this Time I had not found Leisure, or so much as Inclination to look into; I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the Tobacco with me to the Table. \\n\\n \\n\\n What Use to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, as to my Distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but I try\u0027d several Experiments with it, as if I was resolv\u0027d it should hit one Way or other: I first took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew\u0027d it in my Mouth, which indeed at first almost stupify\u0027d my Brain, the Tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much us\u0027d to it; then I took some and steeped it an Hour or two in some Rum, and resolv\u0027d to take a Dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a Pan of Coals, and held my Nose close over the Smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almost for Suffocation. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the Bible and began to read, but my Head was too much disturb\u0027d with the Tobacco to bear reading, at least that Time; only having open\u0027d the Book casually, the first Words that occurr\u0027d to me were these, Call on me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Words were very apt to my Case, and made some Impression upon my Thoughts at the Time of reading them, tho\u0027 not so much as they did afterwards; for as for being deliver\u0027d, the Word had no Sound, as I may say, to me; the Thing was so remote, so impossible in my Apprehension of Things, that I began to say as the Children of Israel did, when they were promis\u0027d Flesh to eat, Can God spread a Table in the Wilderness? so I began to say, Can God himself deliver me from this Place? and as it was not for many Years that any Hope appear\u0027d, this prevail\u0027d very often upon my Thoughts: But however, the Words made a great Impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and the Tobacco had, as I said, doz\u0027d my Head so much, that I inclin\u0027d to sleep; so I left my Lamp burning in the Cave, least I should want any Thing in the Night, and went to Bed; but before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my Life, I kneel\u0027d down and pray\u0027d to God to fulfil the Promise to me, that if I call\u0027d upon him in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me; after my broken and imperfect Prayer was over, I drunk the Rum in which I had steep\u0027d the Tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the Tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down; immediately upon this I went to Bed, I found presently it flew up in my Head violently, but I fell into a sound Sleep, and wak\u0027d no more \u0027till by the Sun it must necessarily be near Three a-Clock in the Afternoon the next Day; nay, to this Hour, I\u0027m partly of the Opinion, that I slept all the next Day and Night, and \u0027till almost Three that Day after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a Day out of my Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appear\u0027d some Years after I had done: for if I had lost it by crossing and re-crossing the Line, I should have lost more than one Day: But certainly I lost a Day in my Accompt, and never knew which Way. \\n\\n \\n\\n Be that however one Way or th\u0027 other, when I awak\u0027d I found my self exceedingly refresh\u0027d, and my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I was stronger than I was the Day before, and my Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in short, I had no Fit the next Day, but continu\u0027d much alter\u0027d for the better; this was the 29th. \\n\\n \\n\\n The 30th was my well Day of Course, and I went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to travel too far, I kill\u0027d a Sea Fowl or two, something like a brand Goose, and brought them Home, but was not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the Turtle\u0027s Eggs, which were very good: This Evening I renew\u0027d the Medicine which I had suppos\u0027d did me good the Day before, viz. the Tobacco steep\u0027d in Rum, only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold my Head over the Smoke; however, I was not so well the next Day, which was the first of July, as I hop\u0027d I shou\u0027d have been; for I had a little Spice of the cold Fit, but it was not much. \\n\\n \\n\\n July 2. I renew\u0027d the Medicine all the three Ways, and doz\u0027d my self with it as at first; and doubled the Quantity which I drank. \\n\\n \\n\\n 3. I miss\u0027d the Fit for good and all, tho\u0027 I did not recover my full Strength for some Weeks after; while I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts run exceedingly upon this Scripture, I will deliver thee, and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay much upon my Mind in Barr of my ever expecting it: But as I was discouraging my self with such Thoughts, it occurr\u0027d to my Mind, that I pored so much upon my Deliverance from the main Affliction, that I disregarded the Deliverance I had receiv\u0027d; and I was, as it were, made to ask my self such Questions as these, viz. Have I not been deliver\u0027d, and wonderfully too, from Sickness? from the most distress\u0027d Condition that could be, and that as so frightful to me, and what Notice I had taken of it? \\n\\n \\n\\n Had I done my Part? God had deliver\u0027d me, but I had not glorify\u0027d him; that is to say, I had not own\u0027d and been thankful for that as a Deliverance, and how cou\u0027d I expect greater Deliverance? \\n\\n \\n\\n This touch\u0027d my Heart very much, and immediately I kneel\u0027d down and gave God Thanks aloud, for my Recovery from my Sickness. \\n\\n \\n\\n July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and impos\u0027d upon my self to read a while every Morning and every Night, not tying my self to the Number of Chapters, but as long as my Thoughts shou\u0027d engage me: It was not long after I set seriously to this Work, but I found my Heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the Wickedness of my past Life: The Impression of my Dream reviv\u0027d, and the Words, All these Things have not brought thee to Repentance, ran seriously in my Thought: I was earnestly begging of God to give me Repentance, when it happen\u0027d providentially the very Day that reading the Scripture, I came to these Words, He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and to give Remission: I threw down the Book, and with my Heart as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a Kind of Extasy of Joy, I cry\u0027d out aloud, Jesus, thou Son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me Repentance! \\n\\n \\n\\n This was the first Time that I could say, in the true Sense of the Words, that I pray\u0027d in all my Life; for now I pray\u0027d with a Sense of my Condition, and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded on the Encouragement of the Word of God; and from this Time, I may say, I began to have Hope that God would hear me. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now I began to construe the Words mentioned above, Call on me, and I will deliver you, in a different Sense from what I had ever done before; for then I had no Notion of any thing being call\u0027d Deliverance, but my being deliver\u0027d from the Captivity I was in; for tho\u0027 I was indeed at large in the Place, yet the Island was certainly a Prison to me, and that in the worst Sense in the World; but now I learn\u0027d to take it in another Sense: Now I look\u0027d back upon my past Life with such Horrour, and my Sins appear\u0027d so dreadful, that my Soul sought nothing of God, but Deliverance from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my Comfort: As for my Solitary Life it was nothing; I did not SO much as pray to be deliver\u0027d from it, or think of it; It was all of no Consideration in Comparison to this: And I add this Part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true Sense of things, they will find Deliverance from Sin a much greater Blessing, than Deliverance from Affliction. \\n\\n \\n\\n But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal. \\n\\n \\n\\n My Condition began now to be, tho\u0027 not less miserable as my Way of living, yet much easier to my Mind; and my Thoughts being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher Nature: I ad a great deal of Comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of; also, as my Health and Strength returned, I bestirr\u0027d my self to furnish my self with every thing that I anted, and make my Way of living as regular as I could. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the 4th of July to the 24th, I was chiefly employ\u0027d walking about with my Gun in my Hand, a little and a little, at a Time, as a Man that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of Sickness: For it is hardly to be imagin\u0027d, how low I was, and to what Weakness I was reduc\u0027d. The Application which I made Use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cur\u0027d an Ague before, neither can recommend it to any one to practise, by this Experiment; and tho\u0027 it did carry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my Nerves and Limbs for some Time. \\n\\n \\n\\n I learn\u0027d from it also this in particular, that being abroad the rainy Season was the most pernicious thing to my Health that could be, especially in those Rains which came ended with Storms and Hurricanes of Wind; for as the in which came in the dry Season was always most accompany\u0027d with such Storms, so I found that Rain was much more dangerous than the Rain which fell in September and October. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had been now in this unhappy Island above 10 Months, all Possibility of Deliverance from this Condition, seem\u0027d to be entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had ever set Foot upon that Place: Having now secur\u0027d my Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind, I had a great Desire to make a more perfect Discovery of the Island, and to see what other Productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular Survey of the Island it self: I went up the Creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my Rafts on Shore; I found after I came about two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little Brook of running Water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry Season, there was hardly any Water in some Parts of it, at least, not enough to run in any Stream, so as it could be perceiv\u0027d. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the Bank of this Brook I found many pleasant Savana\u0027s, or Meadows; plain, smooth, and cover\u0027d with Grass; and on the rising Parts of them next to the higher Grounds, where the Water, as it might be supposed, never overflow\u0027d I found a great deal of Tobacco, green, and growing to great and very strong Stalk; there were divers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Understanding about, and might perhaps have Vertues of their own, which I could find out. \\n\\n \\n\\n I searched for the Cassava Root, which the Indians in all that climate make their Bread of, but I could find I saw large Plants of Alloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several Sugar Canes, but wild, and for Cultivation, imperfect. I contented my self with these Discoveries for this Time, and came back musing with myself what Course I might take to know the Vertue and Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no Conclusion; for in short, I had made so little Observation while I wad in the Brasils, that I knew little of the Plants in the Field, at least very little that might serve me to any Purpose now in my Distress. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next Day, the 16th, I went up the same Way again, and after going something farther than I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and the Savana\u0027s began to cease, and the Country became more woody than before; in this Part I found different Fruits, and particularly I found Mellons upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes upon the Trees; the Vines had spread indeed over the Trees, and the Clusters of Grapes were just now in their Prime, very ripe and rich: This was a surprising Discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warn\u0027d by my Experience to eat sparingly of them, remembring, that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of Grapes kill\u0027d several of our English Men who were Slaves there, by throwing them into Fluxes and Feavers: But I found an excellent Use for these Grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep them as dry\u0027d Grapes or Raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, as wholesom as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes might be to be had. \\n\\n \\n\\n I spent all that Evening there, and went not back to my Habitation, which by the Way was the first Night, as I might say, I had lain from Home. In the Night I took my first Contrivance, and got up into a Tree, where I slept well, and the next Morning proceeded upon my Discovery, travelling near four Miles, as I might judge by the Length of the Valley, keeping still due North, with a Ridge of Hills on the South and North-side of me. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the End of this March I came to an Opening, where the Country seem\u0027d to descend to the West, and a little Spring of fresh Water which issued out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the other Way, that is due East; and the Country appear\u0027d so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant Verdure, or Flourish of Spring, that it looked like a planted Garden. \\n\\n \\n\\n I descended a little on the Side of that delicious Vale, surveying it with a secret Kind of Pleasure, (tho\u0027 mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to think that this was all my own, that I was King and Lord of all this Country indefeasibly, and had a Right of Possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as any Lord of a Mannor in England. I saw here Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Lemmon, and Citron Trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any Fruit, at least not then: However, the green Limes that I gathered, were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mix\u0027d their Juice afterwards with Water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool, and refreshing. \\n\\n \\n\\n I found now I had Business enough to gather and carry Home; and I resolv\u0027d to lay up a Store, as well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnish my self for the wet Season, which I knew was approaching. \\n\\n \\n\\n In Order to this, I gather\u0027d a great Heap of Grapes in one Place, and a lesser Heap in another Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in another Place; and taking a few of each with me, I travell\u0027d homeward, and resolv\u0027d to come again, and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make to carry the rest Home. \\n\\n \\n\\n Accordingly, having spent three Days in this Journey, I came Home; so I must now call my Tent and my Cave: But, before I got thither, the Grapes were spoil\u0027d; the Richness of the Fruits, and the Weight of the Juice having broken them, and bruis\u0027d them, they were good for little or nothing; as to the Limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next Day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small Bags to bring Home my Harvest: But I was surpriz\u0027d, when coming to my Heap of Grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gather\u0027d them, I found them all spread about, trod to Pieces, and dragg\u0027d about, some here, some there, and Abundance eaten and devour\u0027d: By this I concluded, there were some wild Creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were, I knew not. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, as I found there there was no laying them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in a Sack, but that one Way they would be destroy\u0027d, and the other Way they would be crush\u0027d with their own Weight. I took another Course; for I gather\u0027d a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that they might cure and dry in the Sun; and as for the Limes and Lemons, I carry\u0027d as many back as I could well stand under. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I came Home from this Journey, I contemplated with great Pleasure the Fruitfulness of that Valley, and the Pleasantness of the Scituation, the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, and the Wood, and concluded, that I had pitch\u0027d upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far the worst Part of the Country. Upon the Whole I began to consider of removing my Habitation; and to look out for a ace equally safe, as where I now was scituate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful Part of the Island. \\n\\n \\n\\n This Thought run long in my Head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some Time, the Pleasantness of the Place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer View of it, and to consider that I was now by the Sea-Side, where it was at least possible that something might happen to my Advantage, and by the same ill Fate that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy Wretches to the same Place; and tho\u0027 it was scarce probable that any such Thing should ever happen, yet to enclose my self among the Hills and Woods, in the Center of the Island, was to anticipate my Bondage, and to render such an Affair not only Improbable, but Impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any Means to remove. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, I was so Enamour\u0027d of this Place, that I spent much of my Time there, for the whole remaining Part of the Month of July; and tho\u0027 upon second Thoughts I resolv\u0027d as above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower, and surrounded it at a Distance with a strong Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could reach, well stak\u0027d, and fill\u0027d between with Brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three Nights together, always going over it with a Ladder, as before; so that I fancy\u0027d now I had my Country-House, and my Sea-Coast-House: And this Work took me up to the Beginning of August. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had but newly finish\u0027d my Fence, and began to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on, and made me stick close to my first Habitation; for tho\u0027 I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece of a Sail, and spread it very well; yet I had not the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor a Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains were extraordinary. \\n\\n \\n\\n About the Beginning of August, as I said, I had finish\u0027d my Bower, and began to enjoy my self. The third of August, I found the Grapes I had hung up were perfectly dry\u0027d, and indeed, were excellent good Raisins of the Sun; so I began to take them down from the Trees, and it was very happy that I did so; for the Rains which follow\u0027d would have spoil\u0027d them, and I had lost the best Part of my Winter Food; for I had above two hundred large Bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carry\u0027d most of them Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and from hence, which was the fourteenth of August, it rain\u0027d more or less, every Day, till the Middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my Cave for several Days. \\n\\n \\n\\n In this Season I was much surpriz\u0027d with the Increase of my Family; I had been concern\u0027d for the Loss of one of my Cats, who run away from me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Astonishment she came Home about the End of August, with three Kittens; this was the more strange to me, because tho\u0027 I had kill\u0027d a wild Cat, as I call\u0027d it, with my Gun; yet I thought it was a quite differing Kind from our European Cats; yet the young Cats were the same Kind of House breed like the old one; and both my Cats being Females, I thought it very strange: But from these three Cats, I afterwards came to be so pester\u0027d with Cats, that I was forc\u0027d to kill them like Vermine, or wild Beasts, and to drive them from my House as much as possible. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the fourteenth of August to the twenty sixth, incessant Rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this Confinement I began to be straitned for Food, but venturing out twice, I one Day kill\u0027d a Goat, and the last Day, which was the twenty sixth, found a very large Tortoise, which was a Treat to me, and my Food was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch of Raisins for my Breakfast, a Piece of the Goat\u0027s Flesh, or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil\u0027d; for to my great Misfortune, I had no Vessel to boil or stew any Thing; and two or three of the Turtle\u0027s Eggs for my Supper. \\n\\n \\n\\n During this Confinement in my Cover, by the Rain, I work\u0027d daily two or three Hours at enlarging my Cave, and by Degrees work\u0027d it on towards one Side, till I came to the Out-Side of the Hill, and made a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence or Wall, and so I came in and out this Way; but I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had manag\u0027d my self before, I was in a perfect Enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay expos\u0027d, and open for any Thing to come in upon me; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living Thing to fear, the biggest Creature that I had yet seen upon the Island being a Goat. \\n\\n \\n\\n September the thirtieth, I was now come to the unhappy Anniversary of my Landing. I cast up the Notches on my Post, and found I had been on Shore three hundred and sixty five Days. I kept this Day as a Solemn Fast, Setting it apart to Religious Exercise, prostrating my self on the Ground with the most serious Humiliation, confessing my Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judgments upon me, and praying to him to have Mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least Refreshment for twelve Hours, even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a Bisket Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to Bed, finishing the Day as I began it. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had all this Time observ\u0027d no Sabbath-Day; for as at first I had no Sense of Religion upon my Mind, I had after some Time omitted to distinguish the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and so did not really know what any Of the Days were; but now having cast up the Days, as above, I found I had been there a Year; so I divided it into Weeks, and set apart every seventh Day for a Sabbath; though I found at the End of my Account I had lost a Day or two in my Reckoning. \\n\\n \\n\\n A line after this my Ink began to fail me, and so I contented my self to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable Events of my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum of other Things. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rainy Season, and the dry Season, began now to appear regular to me, and I learn\u0027d to divide them so, as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought all my Experience before I had it; and this I am going to relate, was one of the most discouraging Experiments that I made at all: I have mention\u0027d that I had sav\u0027d the few Ears of Barley and Rice, which I had so surprizingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there was about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twenty of Barley; and now I thought it a proper Time to sow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its Southern Position going from me. \\n\\n \\n\\n Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well as I could with my wooden Spade, and dividing it into two Parts, I sow\u0027d my Grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occur\u0027d to my Thoughts, That I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper Time for it; so I sow\u0027d about two Thirds of the Seed, leaving about a Handful of each. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that I did so, for not one Grain of that I sow\u0027d this Time came to any Thing; for the dry Months following, the Earth having had no Rain after the Seed was sown, it had no Moisture to assist its Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet Season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finding my first Seed did not grow, which I easily imagin\u0027d was by the Drought, I fought for a moister Piece of Ground to make another Trial in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new Bower, and sow\u0027d the rest of my Seed in February, a little before the Vernal Equinox; and this having the rainy Months of March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good Crop; but having Part of the Seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had I had but a small Quantity at last, my whole Crop not amounting to above half a Peck of each kind. \\n\\n \\n\\n But by this Experiment I was made Master of my Business, and knew exactly when the proper Season was to sow; and that I might expect two Seed Times, and two Harvests every Year. \\n\\n \\n\\n While this Corn was growing, I made a little Discovery which was of use to me afterwards: As soon as the Rains were over, and the Weather began to settle, which was about the Month of November, I made a Visit up the Country to my Bower, where though I had not been some Months, yet I found all Things just as I left them. The Circle or double Hedge that I had made, was not only firm and entire; but the Stakes which I had cut out of some Trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long Branches, as much as a Willow-Tree usually shoots the first Year after lopping its Head. I could not tell what Tree to call it, that these Stakes were cut from. I was surpriz\u0027d, and yet very well pleas\u0027d, to see the young Trees grow; and I prun\u0027d them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew into in three Years; so that though the Hedge made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Diameter, yet the Trees, for such I might now call them, soon cover\u0027d it; and it was a compleat Shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry Season. \\n\\n \\n\\n This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes, and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle round my Wall; I mean that of my first Dwelling, which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in a double Row, at about eight Yards distance from my first Fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine Cover to my Habitation, and afterward serv\u0027d for a Defence also, as I shall observe in its Order. \\n\\n \\n\\n I found now, That the Seasons of the Year might generally be divided, not into Summer and Winter, as in Europe; but into the Rainy Seasons, and the Dry Seasons, which were generally thus, \\n\\n \\n\\n Half February, March, Half April, \\n\\n Rainy, the Sun being then on, or near the Equinox. \\n\\n Half April, May, June, July, Half August, \\n\\n Dry, the Sun being then to the North of the Line. \\n\\n \\n\\n Half August, September, Half October, \\n\\n Rainy, the Sun being then come back. \\n\\n \\n\\n Half October, November, December, January, Half February, \\n\\n Dry, the Sun being then to the South of the Line. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the Winds happen\u0027d to blow; but this was the general Observation I made: After I had found by Experience, the ill Consequence of being abroad in the Rain. I took Care to furnish my self with Provisions before hand, that I might not be oblig\u0027d to go out; and I sat within Doors as much as possible during the wet Months. \\n\\n This Time I found much Employment, (and very suitable also to the Time) for I found great Occasion of many Things which I had no way to furnish my self with, but by hard Labour and constant Application; particularly, I try\u0027d many Ways to make my self a Basket, but all the Twigs I could get for the Purpose prov\u0027d so brittle, that they would do nothing. It prov\u0027d of excellent Advantage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I used to take great Delight in standing at a Basketmaker\u0027s, in the Town where my Father liv\u0027d, to see them make their Wicker-ware; and being as Boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great Observer of the Manner how they work\u0027d those Things, and sometimes lending a Hand, I had by this Means full Knowledge of the Methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials; when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the Sallow\u0027s, and Willows, and Osiers in England, and I resolv\u0027d to try. \\n\\n \\n\\n Accordingly the next Day, I went to my Country-House, as I call\u0027d it, and cutting some of the smaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the next Time prepar\u0027d with a Hatchet to cut down a Quantity, which I soon found, for there was great Plenty of them; these I set up to dry within my Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Use, I carry\u0027d them to my Cave, and here during the next Season, I employ\u0027d my self in making, as well as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry Earth, or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had occasion; and tho\u0027 I did not finish them very handsomly, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my Purpose; and thus afterwards I took Care never to be without them; and as my Wicker-ware decay\u0027d, I made more, especially, I made strong deep Baskets to place my Corn in, instead of Sacks, when I should come to have any Quantity of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Having master\u0027d this Difficulty, and employ\u0027d a World of Time about it, I bestirr\u0027d my self to see if possible how to supply two Wants: I had no Vessels to hold any Thing that was Liquid, except two Runlets which were almost full of Rum, and some Glass-Bottles, some of the common Size, and others which were Case-Bottles square, for the holding of Waters, Spirits, etc. I had not so much as a Pot to boil any Thing, except a great Kettle, which I sav\u0027d out of the Ship, and which was too big for such Use as I desir\u0027d it, viz. To make Broth, and stew a Bit of Meat by it self. The Second Thing I would fain have had, was a Tobacco-Pipe; but it was impossible to me to make one, however, I found a Contrivance for that too at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n I employ\u0027d my self in Planting my Second Rows of Stakes or Piles and in this Wicker working all the Summer, or dry Season, when another Business took me up more Time than it could be imagin\u0027d I could spare. \\n\\n \\n\\n I mention\u0027d before, That I had a great Mind to see the whole Island, and that I had travell\u0027d up the Brook, and so on to where I built my Bower, and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on the other Side of the Island; I now resolv\u0027d to travel quite Cross to the Sea-Shore on that Side; so taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog, and a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than usual, with two Bisket Cakes, and a great Bunch of Raisins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my Journey; when I had pass\u0027d the Vale where my Bower stood as above, I came within View of the Sea, to the West, and it being a very clear Day, I fairly descry\u0027d Land, whether an Island or a Continent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from the West, to the W. S. W. at a very great Distance; by my Guess it could not be less than Fifteen or Twenty Leagues off. \\n\\n \\n\\n I could not tell what Part of the World this might be, otherwise than that I know it must be Part of America, and as I concluded by all my Observations, must be near the Spanish Dominions, and perhaps was all Inhabited by Savages, where if I should have landed, I had been in a worse Condition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the Dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own, and to believe, order\u0027d every Thing for the best; I say, I quieted my Mind with this, and left afflicting my self with Fruitless Wishes of being there. \\n\\n \\n\\n Besides, after some Pause upon this Affair, I consider\u0027d, that if this Land was the Spanish Coast, I should certainly, one Time or other, see some Vessel pass or re-pass one Way or other; but if not, then it was the Savage Coast between the Spanish Country and Brasils, which are indeed the worst of Savages; for they are Cannibals, or Men-eaters, and fail not to murther and devour all the humane Bodies that fall into their Hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n With these Considerations I walk\u0027d very leisurely forward, I found that Side of the Island where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or Savanna Fields sweet, adorn\u0027d with Flowers and Grass, and full of very fine Woods. I saw Abundance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one, if possible to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some Pains taking, catch a young Parrot, for I knock\u0027d it down with a Stick, and having\u0027 recover\u0027d it, I brought it home; but it was some Years before I could make him speak: However, at last I taught him to call me by my Name very familiarly: But the Accident that follow\u0027d, tho\u0027 it be a Trifle, will be very diverting in its Place. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I found in the low Grounds Hares, as I thought them to be, and Foxes, but they differ\u0027d greatly from all the other Kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy my self to eat them, tho\u0027 I kill\u0027d several: But I had no Need to be ventrous; for I had no Want of Food, and of that which was very good too; especially these three Sorts, viz.Goats, Pidgeons, and Turtle or Tortoise; which, added to my Grapes, Leaden-hall Market could not have furnish\u0027d a Table better than I, in Proportion to the Company; and tho\u0027 my Cafe was deplorable enough, yet I had great Cause for Thankfulness, that I was not driven to any Extremities for Food; but rather Plenty, even to Dainties. \\n\\n \\n\\n I never travell\u0027d in this Journey above two Miles outright in a Day, or thereabouts; but I took so many Turns and Returns, to see what Discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the Place where I resolv\u0027d to sit down for all Night; and then I either repos\u0027d my self in a Tree, or surrounded my self with a Row of Stakes set upright in the Ground, either from one Tree to another, or so as no wild Creature could come at me, without Waking me. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was surpriz\u0027d to see that I had taken up my Lot on the worst Side of the Island; for here indeed the Shore was cover\u0027d with innumerable Turtles, whereas on the other Side I had found but three in a Year and half. Here was also an infinite Number of Fowls, of many Kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I had not seen of before, and many of them very good Meat; but such as I knew not the Names of, except those call\u0027d Penguins. \\n\\n \\n\\n I could have shot as many as I pleas\u0027d, but was very sparing of my Powder and Shot; and therefore had more Mind to kill a she Goat, if I could, which I could better feed on; and though there were many Goats here more than on my Side the Island, yet it was with much more Difficulty that I could come near them, the Country being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the Hill. \\n\\n \\n\\n I confess this Side of the Country was much pleasanter than mine, but yet I had not the least Inclination to remove; for as I was fix\u0027d in my Habitation, it became natural to me, and I seem\u0027d all the while I was here, to be as it were upon a Journey, and from Home: However, I travell\u0027d along the Shore of the Sea, towards the East, I suppose about twelve Miles; and the setting up a great Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I would go Home again; and that the next Journey I took should be on the other Side of the Island, East from my Dwelling, and so round till I came to my Post again: Of which in its Place. \\n\\n \\n\\n I took another Way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily keep all the Island so much in my View, that I could not miss finding my first Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I found my self mistaken; for being come about two or three Miles, I found my self descended into a very large Valley; but so surrounded with Hills, and those Hills cover\u0027d with Wood, that I could not see which was my Way by any Direction but that of the Sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the Position of the Sun at that Time of the Day. \\n\\n \\n\\n It happen\u0027d to my farther Misfortune, That the Weather prov\u0027d hazey for three or four Days, while was in this Valley; and not being able to see the Sun, I wander\u0027d about very uncomfortably, and at last was oblig\u0027d to find out the Sea Side, look for my Post, and come back the same Way I went; and then by easy Journies I turn\u0027d Homeward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things very heavy. \\n\\n \\n\\n In this Journey my Dog surpriz\u0027d a young Kid, and seiz\u0027d upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and sav\u0027d it alive from the Dog: I had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could; for I had often been musing, Whether it might not be possible to get a Kid or two, and so raise a Breed of tame Goats, which might supply me when my Powder and Shot should be all spent. \\n\\n \\n\\n I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with a String which I made of some Rope-Yarn, which I always carry\u0027d about me, I led him along, tho\u0027 with some Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and there I enclos\u0027d him, and left him; for I was very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had been absent above a Month. \\n\\n \\n\\n I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to me, to come into my old Hutch, and lye down in my Hamock-Bed: This little wandring Journey, without settled Place of Abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own House, as I call\u0027d it to my self, was a perfect Settlement to me, compar\u0027d to that; and it rendred every Thing about me so comfortable, that I resolv\u0027d I would never go a great Way from it again, while it should be my Lot to stay on the Island. \\n\\n \\n\\n I repos\u0027d my self here a Week, to rest and regale my self after my long Journey; during which, most of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be a meer Domestick, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor Kid, which I had penn\u0027d in within my little Circle, and resolv\u0027d to go and fetch it Home, or give it some Food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but almost starv\u0027d for want of Food: I went and cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of such Shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I ty\u0027d it as I did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have ty\u0027d it; for it follow\u0027d me like a Dog; and as I continually fed it, the Creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that Time one of my Domesticks also, and would never leave me afterwards. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rainy Season of the Autumnal Equinox was now come, and I kept the 30th of Sept. in the same solemn Manner as before, being the Anniversary of my Landing on the Island, having now been there two Years, and no more Prospect of being deliver\u0027d, than the first Day I came there. I spent the whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledgments of the many wonderful Mercies which my Solitary Condition was attended with, and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had been pleas\u0027d to discover to me, even that it was possible I might be more happy in this Solitary Condition, than I should have been in a Liberty of Society, and in all the Pleasures of the World. That he could fully make up to me, the Deficiencies of my Solitary State, and the want of Humane Society by his Presence, and the Communications of his Grace to my Soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his Providence here, and hope for his Eternal Presence hereafter. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this Life I now led was, with all its miserable Circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable Life I led all the past Part of my Days; and now I chang\u0027d both my Sorrows and my Joys; my very Desires alter\u0027d, my Affections chang\u0027d their Gusts, land my Delights were perfectly new, from what they were at my first Coming, or indeed for the two Years past. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before, as I walk\u0027d about, either on, my Hunting, or for viewing the Country, the Anguish of my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon me on a sudden, and my very Heart would die within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains, the Desarts I was in; and how I was a Prisoner lock\u0027d up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the Ocean, in an uninhabited Wilderness, without Redemption: In the midst of the greatest Composures of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my Work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the Ground for an Hour or -two together; and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst out into Tears, or vent my self by Words, it would go off, and the Grief having exhausted it self would abate. \\n\\n \\n\\n But now I began to exercise my self with new Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and apply\u0027d all the Comforts of it to my present State: One Morning being very sad, I open\u0027d the Bible upon these Words, I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee; immediately it occurr\u0027d, That these Words were to me, Why else should they be directed in such a Manner, just at the Moment when I was mourning over my Condition, as one forsaken of God and Man? Well then, said I, if God does not forsake me, of what ill Consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the World should all forsake me, seeing on the other Hand, if I had all the World, and should lose the Favour and Blessing of God, there wou\u0027d be no Comparison in the Loss. \\n\\n \\n\\n From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind, That it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken Solitary Condition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any other Particular State in the World; and with this Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for bringing me to this Place. \\n\\n \\n\\n I know not what it was, but something shock\u0027d my Mind at that Thought, and I durst not speak the Words: How canst thou be such a Hypocrite, (said I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for a Condition, which however thou mav\u0027st endeavour to be contented with, thou would\u0027st rather pray heartily to be deliver\u0027d from; so I stopp\u0027d there: But though I could not say, I thank\u0027d God for being there; yet I sincerely gave Thanks to God for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting Providences, to see the former Condition of my Life, and to mourn for my Wickedness, and repent. I never open\u0027d the Bible, or shut it, but my very Soul within me, bless\u0027d God for directing my Friend in England, without any Order of mine, to pack it up among my Goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the Wreck of the Ship. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus, and in this Disposition of Mind, I began my third Year: and tho\u0027 I have not given the Reader the Trouble of so particular Account of my Works this Year as the first; yet in General it may be observ\u0027d, That I was very seldom idle; but having regularly divided my Time, according to the several daily Employments that were before me, such as, First, My Duty to God, and the Reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some Time for thrice every Day. Secondly, The going Abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally took me up three Hours in every Morning, when it did not Rain. Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had kill\u0027d or catch\u0027d for my Supply; these took up great Part of the Day; also it is to be considered that the middle of the Day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Violence of the Heat was too great to stir out; so that about four Hours in the Evening was all the Time I could be suppos\u0027d to work in; with this Exception, That sometimes I chang\u0027d my Hours of Hunting and Working, and went to work in the Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the Afternoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n To this short Time allow\u0027d for Labour, I desire may be added the exceeding Laboriousness of my Work; the many Hours which for want of Tools, want of Help, and want of Skill, every Thing I did, took up out of my Time: For Example, I was full two and forty Days making me a Board for a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave; whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit, would have cut six of them out of the same Tree in half a Day. \\n\\n \\n\\n My Case was this, It was to be a large Tree, which was to be cut down, because my Board was to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days a cutting down, and two more cutting off the Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduc\u0027d both the Sides of it into Chips, till it begun to be light enough to move; then I turn\u0027d it, and made one Side of it smooth, and flat, as a Board from End to End; then turning that Side downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the plank to be about three Inches thick, and smooth on both Sides. Any One may judge the Labour of my Hands in such a Piece of Work; but Labour and Patience carry\u0027d me through that and many other Things: I only observe this in Particular, to shew, The Reason why so much of my Time went away with so little Work, viz.That what might be a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vast Labour, and requir\u0027d a prodigious Time to do alone, and by hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n But notwithstanding this, with Patience and Labour I went through many Things; and indeed every Thing that my Circumstances made necessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was now, in the Months of November and December, expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice. The Ground I had manur\u0027d or dug up for them was not great; for as I observ\u0027d, my Seed of each was not above the Quantity of half a Peck; for I had lost one whole Crop by sowing in the dry Season; but now my Crop promis\u0027d very well, when on a sudden I found I was in Danger of losing it all again by Enemies of several Sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it; as First, The Goats, and wild Creatures which I call\u0027d Hares who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade, lay in it Night and Day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get no Time to shoot up into Stalk. \\n\\n \\n\\n This I saw no Remedy for, but by making an Enclosure about it with a Hedge, which I did with a great deal of Toil; and the more, because it requir\u0027d Speed. However, as my Arable Land was but small, suited to my Crop, I got it totally well fenc\u0027d, in about three Weeks Time; and shooting some of the Creatures in the Day Time, I set my Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a Stake at the Gate, where he would stand and bark all Night long; so in a little Time the Enemies forsook the Place, and the Corn grew very strong, and well, and began to ripen apace. \\n\\n \\n\\n But as the Beasts ruined me before, while my Corn was in the Blade; so the Birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear; for going along by the Place to see how it throve, I saw my little Crop surrounded with Fowls of I know not how many Sorts, who stood as it were watching till I should be gone: I immediately let fly among them (for I always had my Gun with me) I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little Cloud of Fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the Corn it self. \\n\\n \\n\\n This touch\u0027d me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a few Days they would devour all my Hopes, that I should be starv\u0027d, and never be able to raise a Crop at all, and what to do I could not tell: However I resolv\u0027d not to loose my Corn, if possible, tho\u0027 I should watch it Night and Day. In the first Place, I went among it to see what Damage was already done, and found they had spoil\u0027d a good deal of it, but that as it was yet too Green for them, the Loss was not so great, but that the Remainder was like to be a good Crop if it could be sav\u0027d. \\n\\n \\n\\n I staid by it to load my Gun, and then coming away I could easily see the Thieves sitting upon all the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away, and the Event proved it to be so; for as I walk\u0027d off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, but they dropt down one by one into the Corn again. I was so provok\u0027d that I could not have Patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every Grain that they eat now, was, as it might be said, a Peck-loaf to me in the Consequence; but coming up to the Hedge, I fir\u0027d again, and kill\u0027d three of them. This was what I wish\u0027d for; so I took them up, and serv\u0027d them as we serve notorious Thieves in England, (viz.) Hang\u0027d them in Chains for a Terror to others; it is impossible to imagine almost, that this should have such an Effect, as it had; for the Fowls wou\u0027d not only not come at the Corn, but in short they forsook all that Part of the Island, and I could never see a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung there. \\n\\n \\n\\n This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end of December, which was our second Harvest of the Year, I reap\u0027d my Crop. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sicle to cut it down, and-all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the Broad Swords or Cutlasses, which I sav\u0027d among the Arms out of the Ship. However, as my first Crop was but small I had no great Difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reap\u0027d it my Way, for I cut nothing off but the Ears, and carry\u0027d it away in a great Basket which I had made, and so rubb\u0027d it out with my Hands; and at the End of all my Harvesting, I found that out of my half Peck of Seed, I had near two Bushels of Rice, and above two Bushels and half of Barley, that is to say, by my Guess, for I had no Measure at that time. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, this was a great Encouragement to me, and I foresaw that in time, it wou\u0027d please God to supply me with Bread: And yet here I was perplex\u0027d again, for I neither knew how to grind or make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made into Meal, how to make Bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my Desire of having a good Quantity for Store, and to secure a constant Supply, I resolv\u0027d not to taste any of this Crop but to preserve it all for Seed against the next Season, and in the mean time to employ all my Study and Hours of Working to accomplish this great Work of Providing my self with Corn and Bread. \\n\\n \\n\\n It might be truly said, that now I work\u0027d for my Bread; \u0027tis a little wonderful, and what I believe few People have thought much upon, (viz.) the strange multitude of little Things necessary in the Providing, Producing, Curing, Dressing, Making and Finishing this one Article of Bread. \\n\\n \\n\\n I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature, found this to my daily Discouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it every Hour, even after I had got the first Handful of Seed-Corn, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprize. \\n\\n \\n\\n First, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquer\u0027d, by making a wooden Spade, as I observ\u0027d before; but this did my Work in but a wooden manner, and tho\u0027 it cost me a great many Days to make it, yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the sooner, but made my Work the harder, and made it be perform\u0027d much worse. \\n\\n \\n\\n However this I bore with, and was content to work it out with Patience, and bear with the badness of the Performance. When the Corn was sow\u0027d, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go over it my self and drag a great heavy Bough of a Tree over it, to Scratch it, as it may be call\u0027d, rather than Rake or Harrow it. \\n\\n \\n\\n When it was growing and grown, I have observ\u0027d already, how many things I wanted, to Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure and Carry it Home, Thrash, Part it from the Chaff, and Save it. Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it, Sieves to Dress it, Yeast and Salt to make it into Bread, and an Oven to bake it, and yet all these things I did without, as shall be observ\u0027d; and yet the Corn was an inestimable Comfort and Advantage to me too. All this, as I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither was my time so much Loss to me, because as I had divided it, a certain Part of it was every Day appointed to these Works; and as I resolv\u0027d to use none of the Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by me, I had the next six Months to apply my self wholly by Labour and Invention to furnish my self with Utensils proper for the performing all the Operations necessary for the making the Corn (when I had it) fit for my use. \\n\\n \\n\\n But first, I was to prepare more Land, for I had now Seed enough to sow above an Acre of Ground. Before I did this, I had a Week\u0027s-work at least to make me a Spade, which when it was done was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and requir\u0027d double Labour to work with it; however I went thro\u0027 that, and sow\u0027d my Seed in two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my House as I could find them to my Mind, and fenc\u0027d them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of which were all cut of that Wood which I had set before, and knew it would grow, so that in one Year\u0027s time I knew I should have a Quick or Living-Hedge, that would want but little Repair. This Work was not so little as to take me up less than three Months, because great Part of that time was of the wet Season, when I could not go abroad. \\n\\n \\n\\n Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found Employment on the following Occasions; always observing, that all the while I was at work I diverted my self with talking to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak, and I quickly learn\u0027d him to know his own Name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud P O L, which was the first Word I ever heard spoken in the Island by any Mouth but my own. This therefore was not my Work, but an assistant to my Work, for now, as I said, I had a great Employment upon my Hands, as follows, (viz.) I had long study\u0027d by some Means or other, to make my self some Earthen Vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them: However, considering the Heat of the Climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any such Clay, I might botch up some such Pot, as might, being dry\u0027d in the Sun, be hard enough, and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any Thing that was dry, and requir\u0027d to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the preparing Corn, Meal, etc. which was the Thing I was upon, I resolv\u0027d to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like Jarrs to hold what should be put into them. \\n\\n \\n\\n It would make the Reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this Paste, what odd mishapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the Clay not being stiff enough to bear its own Weight; how many crack\u0027d by the over violent Heat of the Sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were dry\u0027d; and in a word, how after having labour\u0027d hard to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home and work it; I could not make above two large earthern ugly things, I cannot call them Jarrs, in about two Months Labour. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, as the Sun bak\u0027d these Two, very dry and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break, and as between the Pot and the Basket there was a little room to spare, I stuff\u0027d it full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and these two Pots being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, when the Corn was bruised. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tho\u0027 I miscarried so much in my Design for large Pots, yet I made several smaller things with better Success, such as little round Pots, flat Dishes, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand turn\u0027d to, and the Heat of the Sun bak\u0027d them strangely hard. \\n\\n \\n\\n But all this would not answer my End, which was to get an earthen Pot to hold what was Liquid, and bear the Fire, which none of these could do. It happen\u0027d after some time, making a pretty large Fire for cooking my Meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Vessels in the Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile. I was agreeably suppris\u0027d to see it, and said to my self, that certainly they might be made to burn whole if they would burn broken. \\n\\n \\n\\n This set me to studying how to order my Fire, so as to make it burn me some Pots. I had no Notion of a Kiln, such as the Potters burn in, or of glazing them with Lead, tho\u0027 I had Some Lead to do it with; but I plac\u0027d three large Pipkins, and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another, and plac\u0027d my Fire-wood all round it with a great Heap of Embers under them, I ply\u0027d the Fire with fresh Fuel round the out-side, and upon the top, till I saw the Pots in the inside red hot quite thro\u0027, and observ\u0027d that they did not crack at all; when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one of them, tho\u0027 it did not crack, did melt or run, for the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted by the violence of the Heat, and would have run into Glass if I had gone on, so I slack\u0027d my Fire gradually till the Pots began to abate of the red Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might not let the Fire abate too fast, in the Morning I had three very good, I will not say handsome Pipkins; and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt as cou\u0027d be desir\u0027d; and one of them perfectly glaz\u0027d with the Running of the Sand. \\n\\n \\n\\n After this Experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of Earthen Ware for my Use; but I must needs say, as to the Shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of making them; but as the Children make Dirt-Pies, Or as a Woman would make Pies, that never learn\u0027d to raise Past. \\n\\n \\n\\n No Joy at a Thing of so mean a Nature was ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire; and I had hardly Patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon the Fire again, with some Water in it, to boil me some Meat, which it did admirably well; and with a Piece of a Kid, I made Some very good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and several other Ingredients, requisite to make it so good as I would have had it been. \\n\\n \\n\\n My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mortar, to stamp or beat some Corn in; for as to the Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Perfection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To supply this Want I was at a great Loss; for of all Trades in the World I was as perfectly unqualify\u0027d for a Stone-cutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any Tools to go about it with. I spent many a Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could find none at all; except what was in the solid Rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the Rocks in the Island of Hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling Stone, which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy Pestle, or would break the Corn without filling it with Sand; so after a great deal of Time lost in searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and resolv\u0027d to look out for a great Block of hard Wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had Strength to stir, I rounded it, and form\u0027d it in the Out-side with my Axe and Hatchet, and then with the Help of Fire, and infinite Labour, made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their Canoes. After this, I made a great heavy Pestle or Beater, of the Wood call\u0027d the Iron-wood, and this I prepar\u0027d and laid by against I had my next Crop of Corn, when I propos\u0027d to my self, to grind, or rather pound my into Meal to make my Bread. \\n\\n \\n\\n My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or Search,\u0027 to dress my Meal, and to part it from the Bran, and the Husk, without which I did not see it possible I could have any Bread. This was a most difficult Thing, so much as but to think on; for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary Thing to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, or Stuff, to search the Meal through. And here I was at a full Stop for many Months; nor did I really know what to do; Linnen I had none left, but what was meer Rags; I had Goats Hair, but neither knew I how to weave it, or spin it; and had I known how, here was no Tools to work it with; all the Remedy that I found for this, was, That at last I did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths which were sav\u0027d out of the Ship, some Neckcloths of Callicoe, or Muslin; and with some Pieces of these, I made three small Sieves, but proper enough for the Work; and thus I made shift for some Years; how I did afterwards, I shall shew in its Place. \\n\\n \\n\\n The baking Part was the next Thing to be consider\u0027d, and how I should make Bread when I came to have Corn; for first I had no Yeast; as to that Part, as there was no supplying the Want, so I did not concern my self much about it: But for an Oven, I was indeed in great Pain; at length I found out an Experiment for that also, which was this; I made some Earthen Vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two Foot Diameter, and not above nine Inches deep; these I burnt in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav\u0027d with some square Tiles of my own making, and burning also; but I should not call them square. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much into Embers, or live Coals, I drew them forward upon this Hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there I let them lye, till the Hearth was very hot, then sweeping away all the Embers, I set down my Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earthen Pot upon them, drew the Embers all round the Out-side of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the Heat; and thus, as well as in the best Oven in the World, I bak\u0027d my Barley Loaves, and became in little Time a meer Pastry-Cook into the Bargain; for I made my self several Cakes of the Rice, and Puddings; indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any Thing to put into them, supposing I had, except the Flesh either of Fowls or Goats. \\n\\n \\n\\n It need not be wondred at, if all these Things took me up most Part of the third Year of my Abode here; for it is to be observ\u0027d, That in the Intervals of these Things, I had my new Harvest and Husbandry to manage; for I reap\u0027d my Corn in its Season, and carry\u0027d it Home as well as I could, and laid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I had Time to rub it out; for I had no Floor to thrash it on, or Instrument to thrash it with. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now indeed my Stock of Corn increasing, I really wanted to build my Barns bigger. I wanted a Place to lay it up in; for the Increase of the Corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the Barley about twenty Bushels, and of the Rice as much, or more; insomuch, that now I resolv\u0027d to begin to use it freely; for my Bread had been quite gone a great while; Also I resolved to see what Quantity would be sufficient for me a whole Year, and to sow but once a Year. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bushels of Barley and Rice, was much more than I could consume in a Year; so I resolv\u0027d to sow just the same Quantity every Year, that I sow\u0027d the last, in Hopes that such a Quantity would fully provide me with Bread, etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n All the while these Things were doing, you may be sure my Thoughts run many times upon the Prospect of Land which I had seen from the other Side of the Island, and I was not without secret Wishes that I were on Shore there, fancying the seeing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country, I might find some Way or other to convey my self farther, and perhaps at last find some Means of Escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dangers of such a Condition, and how I might fall into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps such as I might have Reason to think far worse than the Lions and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came into their Power, I should run a Hazard more than a thousand to one of being kill\u0027d, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the People of the Carribean Coast were Canibals, or Man-eaters; and I knew by the Latitude that I could not be far off from that Shore. That suppose they were not Canibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their Hands had been serv\u0027d, even when they had been ten or twenty together; much more I\u0027 that was but one, and could make little or no Defence: All these Things, I say, which I ought to have consider\u0027d well of, and did cast up in my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first; but my Head run mightily upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now I wish\u0027d for my Boy Xury, and the long Boat, with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with which I sail\u0027d above a thousand Miles on the Coast of Africk; but this was In vain. Then I thought I would go and look at our Ship\u0027s Boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the Shore, a great Way in the Storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not quite; and was turn\u0027d by the Force of the Waves and the Winds almost Bottom upward, against a high Ridge of Beachy rough Sand; but no Water about her as before. \\n\\n \\n\\n If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to have launch\u0027d her into the Water, the Boat would have done well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brasils with her easily enough; but I might have foreseen, That I could no more turn her, and set her upright upon her Bottom, than I could remove the Island: However, I went to the Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought them to the Boat, resolv\u0027d to try what I could do, suggesting to my self, That if I could but turn her down, I might easily repair the Damage she had receiv\u0027d, and she would be a very good Boat, and I might go to Sea in her very easily. \\n\\n \\n\\n I spar\u0027d no Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitless Toil, and spent, I think, three or four Weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the Sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting Pieces of Wood to thrust and guide it right in the Fall. \\n\\n \\n\\n But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get under it, much less to move it forward, towards the Water; so I was forc\u0027d to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of the Boat, my desire to venture over for the Main increased, rather than decreased, as the Means for it seem\u0027d impossible. \\n\\n \\n\\n This at length put me upon thinking, Whether it was not possible to make my self a Canoe, or Periagua, such as the Natives of those Climates make, even without Tools, or, as I might say, without Hands, viz. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleas\u0027d my self extreamly with the Thoughts of making it, and with my having much more Convenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians; but not at all considering the particular Inconveniences which I lay under, more than the Indians did, viz.Want of Hands to move it, when it was made, into the Water, a Difficulty much harder for me to surmount, than all the Consequences of Want of Tools could be to them; for what was it to me, That when I had chosen a vast Tree in the Woods, I might with much Trouble cut it down, if after I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub the Out-side into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut out the In-side to make it hollow, so to make a Boat of it: If after all this, I must leave it just there where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the Water. \\n\\n \\n\\n One would have thought, I could not have had the least Reflection upon my Mind of my Circumstance, while I was making this Boat; but I should have immediately thought how I should get it into the Sea; but my Thoughts were so intent upon my Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once consider\u0027d how I should get it off of the Land; and it was really in its own Nature more easy for me to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than about forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to set it a float in the Water. \\n\\n \\n\\n I went to work upon this Boat, the most like a Fool, that ever Man did, who had any of his Senses awake. I pleas\u0027d my self with the Design, without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but that the Difficulty of launching my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a stop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolish Answer which I gave my self, Let\u0027s first make it, I\u0027ll warrant I\u0027ll find some Way or other to get it along, when \u0027tis done. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was a most preposterous Method; but the Eagerness of my Fancy prevail\u0027d, and to work I went. I fell\u0027d a Cedar Tree: I question much whether Solomon ever had such a One for the Building of the Temple at Jerusalem. It was five Foot ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at the End of twenty two Foot, after which it lessen\u0027d for a while, and then parted into Branches: It was not without infinite Labour that I fell\u0027d this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hewing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more getting the Branches and Limbs, and the vast\u0027 spreading Head of it cut off, which I hack\u0027d and hew\u0027d through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpressible Labour: After this, it cost me a Month to shape it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to something like the Bottom of a Boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three Months more to clear the In-side, and work it out so, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did indeed without Fire, by meer Malett and Chissel, and by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome Periagua, and big enough to have carry\u0027d six and twenty Men, and consequently big enough to have carry\u0027d me and all my Cargo. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I had gone through this Work, I was extremely delighted with it. The Boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a Canoe, or Periagua, that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a weary Stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and there remain\u0027d nothing but to get it into the Water; and had I gotten it into the Water, I make no question but I should have began the maddest Voyage, and the most unlikely to be perform\u0027d, that ever was undertaken. \\n\\n \\n\\n But all my Devices to get it into the Water fail\u0027d me; tho\u0027 they cost me infinite Labour too. It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water, and not more: But the first Inconvenience was, it was up Hill towards the Creek; well, to take away this Discouragement, I resolv\u0027d to dig into the Surface of the Earth, and so make a Declivity: This I begun, and it cost me a prodigious deal of Pains; but who grutches Pains, that have their Deliverance in View: But then this was work\u0027d through, and this Difficulty manag\u0027d, it was still much at one; for I could no more stir the Canoe, than I could the other Boat. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then I measur\u0027d the Distance of Ground, and resolv\u0027d to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Water up to the Canoe, seeing I could not bring the Canoe down to the Water: Well, I began this Work, and when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, That by the Number of Hands I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve Years before I should have gone through with it; for the Shore lay high, so that at the upper End, it must have been at least twenty Foot Deep; so at length, tho\u0027 with great Reluctancy, I gave this Attempt over also. \\n\\n \\n\\n This griev\u0027d me heartily, and now I saw, tho\u0027 too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we count the Cost; and before we judge rightly of our own Strength to go through with it. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the middle of this Work, I finish\u0027d my fourth Year in this Place, and kept my Anniversary with the same Devotion, and with as much Comfort as ever before; for by a constant Study, and serious Application of the Word of God, and by the Assistance of his Grace, I gain\u0027d a different Knowledge from what I had before. I entertain\u0027d different Notions of Things. I look\u0027d now upon the World as a Thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no Expectation from, and indeed no Desires about: In a Word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have; so I thought it look\u0027d as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a Place I had liv\u0027d in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, Between me and thee is a great Gulph fix\u0027d. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the first Place, I was remov\u0027d from all the Wickedness of the World here. I had neither the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, or the Pride of Life. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that I was now capable of enjoying: I was Lord of the whole Mannor; or if I pleas\u0027d, I might call my self King, or Emperor over the whole Country which I had Possession of. There were no Rivals. I had no Competitor, none to dispute Sovereignty or Command with me. I might have rais\u0027d Ship Loadings of Corn; but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my Occasion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 第三部分 \\n\\n \\n\\n 英文 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 当我在海上被葡萄牙船长救起来时，受到他优厚、公正和仁慈的待遇，但我心里没有对上帝产生一点感激之情。后来我再度遭受船难，并差一点在这荒岛边淹死，我也毫无忏悔之意，也没有把此当作对我的报应。我只是经常对自己说，我是个\"晦气鬼\"，生来要吃苦受罪。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 确实，我一上岸，发现其他船员全都葬身大海，唯我一人死里逃生，着实惊喜了一番；在狂喜中，我若能想到上帝，就会产生真诚的感恩之情。但我仅仅欣喜一阵子而已，高兴过了也就算了。我对自己说，我庆幸自己能活下来，却没有好好想一下，别人都死了，单单我一人幸免于难，岂不是上帝对我的特殊恩宠；也没有深入思考一下，上天为什么对我如此慈悲。我像一般船员一样，沉船之后，侥幸平安上岸，当然欣喜万分；然后就喝上几杯甜酒，把船难忘得一干二净。我一生就过着这样的生活。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 后来，经过了一番思考，对自己的状况有了清醒的认识，知道自己流落到这个可怕的荒岛上，远离人烟，毫无获救的希望。尽管自己知道身陷绝境，但一旦我发现还能活下去，不致饿死，我的一切苦恼也随之烟消云散了。我又开始过着无忧无虑的生活，一心一意干各种活儿以维持自己的生存。我一点也没有想到，我目前的不幸遭遇，是上天对我的惩罚，是上帝对我的报应。说实话，这种思想很少进入我的头脑里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 前面我在日记中已经提到过，在大麦刚刚长出来时，我曾一度想到上帝，并深受感动，因为我最初认为那是上帝显示的神迹。但后来发现这并非是上帝的神迹，我感受的印象也就随之消失了。关于这一点，我前面已记过了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 地震该是大自然最可怕的景象了吧，而且，这往往使人想到冥冥中的那种神力，这种神力往往又与上帝或天意联系在一起。可是，在最初的一阵恐惧过去之后，关于神力和上帝的印象也马上随之消失。我既不觉得有什么上帝，也不认为有所谓上帝的审判，也没有想到我目前可悲的处境是出于上帝的意旨，好像我一直生活得十分优裕舒适似的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可是现在，我生病了，死亡的悲惨境遇渐渐在我面前呈现。由于病痛，我精神颓丧；由于发热，我体力衰竭。这时，我沉睡已久的良心开始苏醒，并开始责备自己过去的生活。在此之前，我罪大恶极，冒犯了上帝，所以现在上帝来惩罚我，给我以非同寻常的打击，用这种报应的手段来对待我。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我的反省，在我生病的第二天和第三天，把我压得透不过气来。由于发热，也由于良心的谴责，从嘴里逼出了几句类似祈祷的话。然而，这种祈祷，有口无心，既无良好的愿望，也不抱任何希望，只是恐惧和痛苦的呼喊而已。这时，我思想极度混乱，深感自己罪孽深重，而一想到自己将在如此悲惨的境况下死去，更是恐怖万分。我心灵惶恐不安，不知道自己嘴里说了些什么话，只是不断地呼喊着这样的话：\"上帝啊，我多可怜啊！我生病了，没有人照顾我，我是必死无疑了！我该怎么办啊？\"于是，我眼泪夺眶而出，半天说不出话来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，我想起了父亲的忠告，也想到了他老人家的预言。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这些我在故事一开始就提到了。父亲说，我如果执意采取这种愚蠢的行动，那么，上帝一定不会保佑我。当我将来呼援无门时，我会后悔自己没有听从他的忠告。这时，我大声说，现在，父亲的话果然应验了：上帝已经惩罚了我，谁也不能来救我，谁也不能来听我的呼救了。我拒绝了上天的好意，上天原本对我十分慈悲，把我安排在一个优裕的生活环境中，让我幸福舒适地过日子。可是，我自己却身在福中不知福，又不听父母的话来认识这种福份。我使父母为我的愚蠢行为而痛心，而现在，我自己也为我的愚蠢行为所带来的后果而痛心。本来，父母可以帮助我成家立业，过上舒适的生活；然而，我却拒绝了他们的帮助。现在，我不得不在艰难困苦中挣扎，困难之大，连大自然本身都难以忍受。而且，我孤独无援，没有人安慰我，也没有人照应我，也没有人忠告我。想到这里，我又大喊大叫：\"上帝啊，救救我吧！我已走投无路了啊！\"多少年来，我第一次发出了祈祷，如果这也可算是祈祷的话。现在，让我重新回到日记上来吧。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 六月二十八日睡了一夜，精神好多了，寒热也完全退了，我就起床了。尽管恶梦之后，心有余悸，但我考虑到疟疾明天可能会再次发作，还不如趁此准备些东西，在我发病时可吃喝。我先把一个大方瓶装满了水，放在床边的桌子上，为了减少水的寒性，又倒了四分之一公升的甘蔗酒在里面，把酒和水掺合起来。然后，又取了一块羊肉，放在火上烤熟，但却吃不了多少。我又四处走动了一下，可是一点力气也没有。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 想到我当前可悲的处境，又担心明天要发病，心里非常苦闷，非常沉重。晚上，我在火灰里烤了三个鳖蛋，剥开蛋壳吃了，算是晚饭。就我记忆所及，我一生中第一次在吃饭时做祷告，祈求上帝的赐福。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 吃过晚饭，我想外出走走，可是周身无力，几乎连枪都拿不动（因为我从来外出都要带枪）。所以我只走了几步，就坐在地上，眺望着面前的海面。这时，海上风平浪静。我坐在那里，心潮起伏，思绪万千。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这大地和大海，尽管我天天看到，可到底是什么呢？它们又来自何方？我和其他一切生灵，野生的和驯养的，人类和野兽，究竟是些什么？又都来自何方？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 毫无疑问，我们都是被一种隐秘的力量创造出来的；也正是这种力量创造了陆地、大海和天空。但这种力量又是什么呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 显然，最合理的答案是上帝创造了这一切。继而，就可得出一个非同寻常的结论：既然上帝创造了这一切，就必然能引导和支配这一切以及一切与之有关的东西。能创造万物的力量，当然也能引导和支配万物。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 既然如此，那么在上帝创造的世界里，无论发生什么事，上帝不可能不知道，甚至就是上帝自己的安排。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 既然发生的事上帝都知道，那上帝也一定知道我现在流落在这荒岛上，境况悲惨。既然发生的一切都是上帝一手安排的，那么，这么多灾难降临到我头上，也是上帝安排的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我想不出有任何理由能推翻这些结论。这使我更加坚信，我遭遇的这些灾难，都是上帝安排的；正是上帝的指使，使我陷入了当前的悲惨境遇。上帝不仅对我，而且对世间万物，都有绝对的支配权力。于是，我马上又想到：\"上帝为什么要这么对待我？我到底做了什么坏事，上帝才这么惩罚我呢？\"这时，我的良心立刻制止我提出这样的问题，好像我亵渎了神明；我好像听到良心对我说：\"你这罪孽深重的人啊，你竟还要问你作下了什么坏事？回头看看你半生的罪孽吧！问问你自己，你什么坏事没有作过？你还该问一下，你本来早就死了，为什么现在还能活着？为什么你没有在雅茅斯港外的锚地中淹死？当你们的船被从萨累开来的海盗船追上时，你为什么没有在作战中死去？你为什么没有在非洲海岸上被野兽吃掉？当全船的人都在这儿葬身大海，为什么唯独你一人没有淹死？而你现在竟还要问，\u0027我作了什么坏事？\u0027\"想到这些，我不禁惊愕得目瞪口呆，无言以对。于是，我愁眉不展地站起来，走回住所。我爬过墙头，准备上床睡觉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可是，我心烦意乱，郁郁不乐，无心入睡。我坐到椅子里，点燃了灯，因为这时天已黑了。我担心旧病复发，心中十分害怕。这时，我忽然想起，巴西人不管生什么病，都不吃药，只嚼烟叶。我箱子里有一卷烟叶，大部分都已烤熟了；也有一些青烟叶，尚未完全烤熟。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是，我就起身去取烟叶。毫无疑问，这是上天指引我去做的。因为，在箱子里，我不仅找到了医治我肉体的药物，还找到了救治我灵魂的良药。打开箱子，我找到了我要找的烟叶；箱子里也有几本我保存下来的书，我取出了一本《圣经》。前面我曾提到过从破船上找到几本《圣经》的事。在此以前，我一直没有闲暇读《圣经》，也无意去读。我刚才说了，我取出了一本《圣经》，并把书和烟叶一起放到桌上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我不知道如何用烟叶来治病，也不知道是否真能治好玻81但我作了多种试验，并想总有一种办法能生效。我先把一把烟叶放在嘴里嚼，一下子，我的头便晕起来。因为，烟叶还是半青的，味道很凶，而我又没有吃烟的习惯。然后，又取了点烟叶，放在甘蔗酒里浸了一两小时，决定睡前当药酒喝下去。最后，又拿一些烟叶放在炭盆里烧，并把鼻子凑上去闻烟叶烧烤出来的烟味，尽可能忍受烟熏的体味和热气，只要不窒息就闻下去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在这样治病的同时，我拿起《圣经》开始读起来。因为烟叶的体味把我的头脑弄得昏昏沉沉的，根本无法认真阅读，就随便打开书，映入我眼睛的第一个句子是：\"你在患难的时候呼求我，我就必拯救你，而你要颂赞我。\"①这些话对我的处境再合适不过了，读了后给我留下深刻的印象，并且，随着时间的过去，印象越来越深，铭记不忘。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 至于得到拯救的话，当时并没有使我动心。在我看来，我能获救的事，实在太渺茫了，太不现实了。正如上帝请其子民以色列人吃肉时，他们竟然问：\"上帝能在旷野摆设筵席吗？\"②所以我也问：\"上帝自己能把我从这个地方拯救出去吗？ \\n\\n \\n\\n \"因为获救的希望在许多年后才出现，所以这个疑问多年来一直在我的脑子里盘旋。话虽如此，但这句话还是给我留下了深刻的印象，并时常使我回味这句话的意思。夜已深了，前面我也提到，烟味弄得我头脑昏昏沉沉的，就很想睡觉了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是，我让灯在石洞里继续点着，以便晚上要拿东西的话会方便些，就上床睡了。临睡之前，我做了一件生平从未做过的事：我跪下来，向上帝祈祷，求他答应我，如果我在患难中向他呼求，他必定会拯救我。我的祈祷断断续续，话不成句。作完了祈祷，我就喝了点浸了烟叶的甘蔗酒。烟叶浸过之后，酒变得很凶，且烟味刺人，几乎无法喝下去。喝过酒后，就立刻上床睡觉。不久，我感到酒力直冲脑门，非常厉害。我就昏昏睡去，直到第二天下午三点钟才醒来。现在，在我记这日记的时候，我有点怀疑，很可能在第二天我睡了整整一天一夜，直到第三天下午三点钟才醒来。因为，几年后，我发现我的日历中这一周少算了一天，却又无法解释其中的原因。要是我来回穿越赤道失去时间的话，我少掉的应该不止一天。事实是，我的确把日子漏记了一天，至于为什么会漏掉这一天，我自己也不得而知。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不管怎么说，醒来时我觉得精神焕发，身体也完全恢复了活力。起床后，我感到力气也比前一天大多了，并且胃口也开了，因为我肚子感到饿了。一句话，第二天疟疾没有发作，身体逐渐复原。这一天是二十九日。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 三十日当然身体更好了，我重又带枪外出，但不敢走得太远。打死了一两只像黑雁那样的海鸟带回家，可又不想吃鸟肉，就又煮了几个鳖蛋吃，味道挺不错。晚上，我又喝了点浸了烟叶的甘蔗酒，因为我感到，正是昨天喝了这种药酒，身体才好起来，这次我喝得不多，也不再嚼烟叶，或烤烟叶熏头。第二天，七月一日，我以为身体会更好些，结果却有穿越赤道不会失去时间。在这里，鲁宾逊也许头脑里想到的是日界线，即83国际日期变更线。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 点发冷，但并不厉害。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 七月二日我重新用三种方法治病，像第一次那样把头弄得昏昏沉沉的，喝下去的药酒也加了一倍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 七月三日病完全好了，但身体过了好几个星期才完全复原。在体力恢复过程中，我时时想到《圣经》上的这句话：\"我就必拯救你。\"但我深深感到，获救是绝不可能的，所以我不敢对此存有任何奢望。正当我为这种念头而感到灰心失望时，忽然醒悟到：我一心只想上帝把我从目前的困境中拯救出来，却没有想到自己已经获得了拯救。于是，我扪心自问：我不是从疾病中被拯救出来了吗？难道这不是一个奇迹？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 我不是也从最不幸、最可怕的境地中被拯救出来了吗？可自己有没有想到这一层呢？自己又有没有尽了本份，做该做的事情呢？\"上帝拯救了我，我却没有颂赞上帝。\"这就是说，我没有把这一切看作上帝对我的拯救，因而也没有感恩，我怎样期望更大的拯救呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 想到这些，我心里大受感动，立即跪下来大声感谢上帝，感谢他使我病好复原。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 七月四日早上，我拿起《圣经》从《新约》读起。这次我是真正认真读了，并决定每天早晚都要读一次，也不规定一定要读多少章，只要想读就读下去。认真读经之后不久，心中受到深切、真诚的感动，觉悟到自己过去的生活，实在罪孽深重，梦中的情景又一次浮现在我的面前。我认真思考了梦中听到的那句话： \\n\\n \\n\\n \"所发生的一切事情都不能使你忏悔。\"那天，我真诚地祈求上帝给我忏悔的机会。忽然，就像有天意似的，在我照例翻阅《圣经》时，读到了这句话：\"上帝又高举他在自己的右边，立为君王和救主，将悔改的心和赦罪的恩，赐给以色列人。\"于是，我放下书，双手举向天空；同时，我的心灵也升向天上，并欣喜若狂地高喊：\"耶稣，你大卫的儿子，耶稣，你被上帝举为君王和救主，请赐给我悔改的心吧！\"这是我有生以来第一次算得上是真正的祈祷，因为，我这次祈祷与自己的境遇联系了起来，并且，这次祈祷是受了上帝的话的鼓舞，抱着一种真正符合《圣经》精神的希望。也可以说，只有从这时期，我才开始希望上帝能听到我的祈祷。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，我开始用一种与以前完全不同的观点，理解我上面提到的那句话：\"你若呼求我，我就必拯救你。\"过去，我所理解的所谓拯救，就是把我从目前的困境中解救出来，因为，虽然我在这里自由自在，但这座荒岛对我来说实在是一座牢狱，而且是世界上最坏的牢狱。而现在，我从另一种意义上来理解\"拯救\"的含义：我回顾自己过去的生活，感到十分惊恐，我深感自己罪孽深重。因此，我现在对上帝别无他求，只求他把我从罪恶的深渊中拯救出来，因为，我的负罪感压得我日夜不安。至于我当前孤苦伶仃的生活，就根本算不了什么。我无意祈求上帝把我从这荒岛上拯救出去，我连想都没有这样想过。与灵魂获救相比，肉体的获救实在无足轻重。在这里，我说了这些话，目的是想让读者明白：一个人如果真的世事通明，就一定会认识到，真正的幸福不是被上帝从患难中拯救出来，而是从罪恶中拯救出来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，闲话少说，重回到日记上来吧。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我当前的境况是：虽然生活依然很艰苦，但精神却轻松多了。由于读《圣经》和祈祷，思想变得高尚了，内心也有了更多的安慰，这种宽慰的心情我以前从未有过。同时，健康和体力也已恢复，我重又振作精神，安排工作，并恢复正常的生活。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 从七月四日至十四日，我主要的活动是带枪外出，四处走走。像大病初愈的人那样，走走歇歇；随着体力逐渐恢复，再逐步扩大活动范围。当时，我精神萎靡，体力虚弱，一般人实难想像。我治病的方法，可以说是史无前例的；也许，这种方法以前从未治愈过疟疾。可我也不能把这个方法介绍给别人。用这个方法疟疾是治好了，但使我身体虚弱不堪。此后好长一段时间，我的神经和四肢还经常抽搐。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这场大病给了我一个教训：雨季外出对健康危害最甚，尤其是飓风和暴风带来的雨危害更大。而在旱季，要么不下雨，一下雨又总是刮暴风。所以，旱季的暴风雨比九、十月间的雨危害更大。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我在荒岛上已有十个多月了，获救的可能性几乎等于零。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我有充分理由相信，在我之前，从未有人上过这孤岛。现在，我已按自己的意愿安排好了住所，就很想进一步了解这座小岛，并看看岛上还有什么我尚未发现的物产。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 七月十五日，我开始对这个小岛作更详细的勘察。我先走到那条小河边。这条小河，先前已经提到，是我木排靠岸的地方。我沿河而上走了约两英里，发现海潮最远只能到达这里。原来这是一条小溪，溪水清澈，口味甚佳。现在适值旱季，溪里有些地方连一滴水也没有；即使有的话，也汇不成水流。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在小溪旁，是一片片可爱的草地，平坦匀净，绿草如茵；在紧靠高地的那些地势较高的地方（显然，这儿是河水泛滥不到的地方），长着许多烟草，绿油油的，茎秆又粗又长。附近还有其他各种各样的植物，可惜我都不认识。这些植物也许各有各的用处，只是我不知道罢了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我到处寻找木薯，那是热带印第安人用来做面包的植物，可是没有找到。我发现了许多很大的芦荟，但当时不知道其用途。我还看到一些甘蔗，因为是野生的，未经人工栽培，所以不太好吃。我感到这回发现的东西已不少了。在回家的路上，心里寻思着如何利用这些新发现，可是毫无头绪。我在巴西时不曾注意观察野生植物，如今陷入困境也就无法加以利用了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二天，十六日，我沿原路走得更远。小溪和草地均已到了尽头，但树木茂盛。在那儿，长着不少水果，地上有各种瓜类，树上有葡萄。葡萄长得很繁茂，葡萄藤爬满树枝，葡萄一串串的，又红又大。这意外的发现使我非常高兴。但经验警告我不能贪吃。我记得，在伯尔伯里上岸时，几个在那儿当奴隶的英国人因葡萄吃得太多，害痢疾和热病死了。但是，我还是想出了一个很好的方法利用这些葡萄，就是把他们放在太阳下晒干，制成葡萄干收藏起来。我相信葡萄干是很好吃的；在不是葡萄成熟的季节，就可以吃葡萄干，又富营养又好吃。后来事实也证明如此。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 那晚我就留在那里，没有回家。顺便说一句，这是我第一次在外面过夜。到了夜里，我还是拿出老办法，爬上一棵大树，舒舒服服地睡了一夜。第二天早上，我又继续我的考察。在山谷里，我大约朝北走了四英里，南面和北面是逶不绝的山脉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后，我来到一片开阔地，地势向西倾斜。一湾清溪从山上流下来，向正东流去。眼前一片清新翠绿，欣欣向荣，一派春天气象；周围景色犹如一个人工花园。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我沿着这个风景秀丽的山坡往下走了一段路，心里暗自高兴，却又夹杂着苦恼。我环顾四周，心里不禁想，这一切现在都是我的，我是这地方无可争辩的君王，对这儿拥有所有权，如果可以转让的话，我可以把这块地方传给子孙后代，像英国采邑的领主那样。在那里，我又发现了许多椰子树、橘子树、柠檬树和橙子树，不过都是野生的，很少结果子，至少目前如此。可是我采集的酸橙不仅好吃，且极富营养。后来，我把酸橙的汁掺上水，吃起来又滋养，又清凉，又提神。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，我得采集一些水果运回家了。我采集了葡萄、酸橙和柠檬，准备贮藏起来好在雨季享用。因为我知道，雨季即将来临。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 因此，我采集了许多葡萄堆在一个地方，在另一个地方又堆了一小堆，又采集了一大堆酸橙和柠檬放在另一个地方。然后，我每种都带了一些走上了回家的路。我决定下次回来时，带个袋或其它什么可装水果的东西，把采集下来的水果运回家。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 路上花了三天才到家。所谓的家，就是我的帐篷和山洞。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可是还没到家，葡萄就都烂掉了。这些葡萄长得太饱满，水份很多，在路上一经挤压，就都破碎流水了，因此根本吃不成，只有少数破碎不太厉害的，尚勉强可吃。至于酸橙倒完好无损，可我不可能带得很多。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二天，十九日，我带着事先做好的两只小袋子回去装运我的收获物。但是，当我来到葡萄堆前面时，原来饱满完好的葡萄，现在都东一片，西一片被拖散开，有的被践踏得破碎不堪，有的则已吃掉了。眼前的情景一片狼籍。这不禁使我大吃一惊。看来，附近一定有野兽出没；至于什么野兽，当然我无法知道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在我才意识到，把葡萄采集下来堆在一起不是办法，用袋装运回去，也不是办法；堆集起来会被野兽吃掉，装运回去会压碎。于是，我想出了另一个办法。我采集了许多葡萄，把它们挂在树枝上；这些树枝当然能伸出树荫晒得到太阳，让太阳把葡萄晒干。但我可以用袋尽量多带些柠檬和酸橙回来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这次外出回家后，我想到那山谷物产丰富，风景优美，心里非常高兴。那边靠近溪流，树木茂盛，不怕暴风雨的袭击。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我这时才发现，我所选定的住处，实在是全岛最坏的地方。总之，我开始考虑搬家问题，打算在那儿找一个安全的场所安家，因为那儿物产丰富，景色宜人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 搬家的念头在我头脑里盘旋了很久；那地方风光明媚，特别诱人。有时，这种念头特别强烈。但仔细一想，住在海边也有住在海边的好处。说不定还有一些别的倒霉蛋，像我一样，交上恶运，来到这座荒岛上。当然，这种事情发生的希望确实很小很小，但把自己关闭在岛中央的山林里，无异于把自己禁闭起来。那时，这种事情不仅没有希望发生，就连可能性也没有了。思前想后，觉得家还是不搬为好。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 家是不准备搬了，但我确实非常喜欢那地方。因此，在七月份这一个月中，我常去那儿，并决定在那儿造一间茅舍，并用一道结实坚固的围墙把它从外面围起来。围墙是由两层篱笆筑成的，有我自己那么高，桩子打得很牢固，桩子之间塞满了矮树。我睡在里面很安全。有时在里面一连睡上两三个晚上，出入照例也用一架梯子爬上爬下。这样，我想我有了一座乡间住宅和一座海滨住宅。这座乡间住宅到八月初才告完工。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我刚把新居的围墙打好，准备享受自己的劳动果实，就下起大雨来。我被困在旧居，无法外出。在新居，我也像这儿旧居那样用帆布搭了个帐篷，并且支撑得十分牢固，但那儿没有小山挡住风暴，下大雨时也无山洞可退身。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 如上所述，八月初，我建好了茅舍，准备在里面享受一番。八月三日，我发现我原先挂在树枝上的一串串葡萄已完全晒干了，成了上等葡萄干。我便动手把它们从树上收下来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我庆幸自己及时收下了葡萄干，要不，后来马上大雨倾盆，葡萄干肯定会全毁了。那样我就会失去冬季一大半的食物。事实上，我差不多晒了两百来串葡萄，而且每串都很大。我刚把葡萄干全收下来，并把大部分运到旧居山洞里贮藏起来，就下起了雨。从这时期，也就是从八月十四日期，一直到十月中旬，几乎天天下雨；有时滂沱大雨，一连几天无法出门。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在这个雨季里，我的家庭成员增加了，这大大出乎我的意料之外。在此之前，有一只猫不见了，不知是死了呢，还是跑了，我一无所知，所以心里一直十分挂念。不料在八月底，它忽然回来了，还带回来了三只小猫。这使我惊讶不已。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 更使我感到奇怪的是，这些小猫完全是家猫，与大猫长得一模一样，它们是怎么生出来的呢？因为，我的两只猫都是母猫。岛上确实有野猫，我还用枪打死过一只。但那种野猫完全是另外一种品种，与欧洲猫不一样。后来，这三只小猫又繁殖了许多后代，闹得我不可开交。最后，我把这些泛滥成灾的猫视为害虫野兽，不是把它们杀掉，就是把它们赶出家门。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 从八月十四日到二十六日，雨下个不停，我无法出门。现在我不敢淋雨了。在此期间，一直困在屋内，粮食贮备逐日减少。我曾冒险两次外出。第一次打杀了一只山羊，第二次，最后一天，即二十六日，找到了一只大鳖，使我大享口福。我的粮食是这样分配的：早餐吃一串葡萄干，中餐吃一块烤羊肉或烤鳖（不幸的是，我没有蒸东西或煮东西的器皿），晚餐吃两三个鳖蛋。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在我被大雨困在家里时，每天工作两三个小时扩大山洞。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我把洞向另一边延伸，一直开通到围墙外，作为边门和进出口。于是，我就可从这条路进出。但这样进出太容易，我晚上就睡不安稳；因为以前，我总是把自己围起来，密不透风。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 而现在，我感到空荡荡的，什么野兽都可来偷袭我。当然，至今还没有发现有什么可怕的野兽，我在岛上见到过的最大的动物，只不过是山羊而已。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 九月十三日到今天我正好来到荒岛一周年。这是一个不幸的日子。我计算了一下柱子上的刻痕，发现我已上岸３６５天了。我把这天定为斋戒日，并举行了宗教仪式，以极端虔诚谦卑的心情跪伏在地上，问上帝忏悔我的罪行，接受他对我公正的惩罚，求他通过耶稣基督可怜我，饶恕我。从早到晚，十二小时中我不吃不喝，直到太阳下山，我才吃了几块饼干和一串葡萄干，然后就上床睡觉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我很久没守安息日了。最初，我头脑里没有任何宗教观念；后来，我忘记把安息日刻成长痕来区别周数，所以根本就不知道哪天是哪天了。现在，我计算了一下日子，知道已经一年了。于是，我把这一年的刻痕按星期划分，每七天留出一个安息日。算到最后，我发现自己漏划了一两天。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不久，我的墨水快用完了，就只好省着点用，只记些生活中的大事，一些其他琐事，我就不再记在日记里了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，我开始摸到了雨季和旱季的规律，学会了怎样划分这两个季节，并为此做好相应的准备。但这个经验来之不易，是花了代价的。下面我将告诉你们我最糟的一次试验。前面提到过，我曾收藏了几颗大麦穗和稻穗；这些麦穗和稻穗，开初我还以为是平空从地里长出来的呢。我估计大约有三十颗稻穗和二十颗麦穗。当时，雨季刚过，太阳逐渐问南移动，我认为这该是播种的时机了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是，我用木铲把一块地挖松，并把这块地分成两部分播种。在播种时，我忽然想到，不能把全部种子播下去，因为我尚未弄清楚什么时候最适宜下种。这样，我播下了三分之二的种子，每样都留了一点下来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 值得庆幸的是，我做对了。我这回下的种子，一颗也没长出来。因为种子下地之后，一连几个月不下雨，土壤里没有水份，不能滋润种子生长，一直到雨季来临才冒了出来，好像这些种子刚播种下去似的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 发现第一次播下去的种子没有长出来，我料定是由于土地干旱之故。于是我想找一块较潮湿的土地再试一次。二月份的春分前几天，我在茅舍附近掘了一块地，把留下的种子通通播下去。接下去是三四月份的雨季，雨水滋润了种子，不久就欣欣向荣地长了出来，获得了一个好收成。但因为种子太少，所收到的大麦和稻子每种约半斗而已。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这次试验，使我成了种田好手，知道什么时候该下种。现在我知道一年可播种两次，收获两次。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在庄稼成长时，我有一个小小的发现，对我后来大有用处。大约十一月，雨季刚过，天气开始转晴，我去了我的乡间茅舍。我离开那儿已好几个月了，但发现一切如旧。我修筑的双层围墙，不仅完好无损，而且，从附近砍下来的那些树桩都发了芽，并长出了长长的枝条，仿佛是去年被修剪过的柳树一样。我不知道这些是什么树，但看到这些小树都成活了，真是喜出望外。我把它们修剪了一番，尽可能让它们长得一样高。三年后，这些树长得体态优雅，简直令人难以置信。虽然篱笆的直径长达２５码，然而这些树很快把篱笆遮住了。这儿真可谓是绿树成荫，整个旱季住在里面十分舒适。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 由此得到启发，我决定在我原来住地的半圆形围墙外，也种一排树。我在离篱笆大约八码的地方，种了两排树，或者也可以说打了两排树桩。树很快长期来。开始，树木遮住了我的篱笆，使我的住所完全隐蔽起来；后来，又成了很好的防御工事。关于这些，我将在后面再叙述。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在我知道，在这儿不像欧洲那样，一年分为夏季和冬季，而是分为雨季和旱季。一年之中的时间大致划分如下：二月后半月三月四月前半月多雨，太阳在赤道上，或靠近赤道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 四月后半月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 五月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 六月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 七月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 八月前半月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 干旱，太阳在赤道北面。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 八月后半月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 九月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 十月前半月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多雨，太阳回到赤道上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 十月后半月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 十一月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 十二月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 一月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 二月前半月 \\n\\n \\n\\n 干旱，太阳在赤道南面。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 雨季有时长，有时短，主要决定于风向。当然，这不过是我大致的观察罢了。生活经验告诉我，淋雨会生病，我就在雨季到来之前贮备好足够的粮食，这样我就不必冒雨外出觅食。在雨季，我尽可能呆在家里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 每到雨季，我做些适于在家做的工作。我知道，我生活中还缺少不少东西，只有用劳动耐心去做才能制造出来，呆在家里正好做这些事。特别是，我曾想过许多办法，想编一个箩筐，但我弄来的枝条都太脆，没有用。小时候，我喜欢站在城里藤皮店的门口看工匠们编箩筐或篮子什么的。像大部分孩子一样，我也爱管闲事；我不仅仔细观察，有时还帮上一手，因此学会了打箩筐。现在，这技术可以派上用场了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 只要有合适的材料，我就可以编出箩筐来。我忽然想到，砍做木桩的那种树的枝条，也许与英国的柳树一样坚韧。于是，我决定拿这种枝条试试看。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二天，我跑到了我的那座乡间住宅，在附近砍了些细枝条，结果发现十分合适。于是，第二次我带了一把斧头，准备多砍一些下来。这种树那边很多，不一会儿就砍下了许多枝条。我把它们放在篱笆上晒干，然后带回我海边住宅的洞室里。第二个雨季来临后，我就用它们来编筐子，并尽可能多编一些，或用来装土，或用来装东西。我的筐子编得不太好看，但还能凑合着用。以后，我经常编些筐子，用坏了就再编新的。我还编了不少较深的筐子，又坚实，又实用。后来，我种的谷物收获多了，就不用袋子而用自编的筐子来装。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 花了大量的时间解决了箩筐问题之后，我又想动手解决其他两个问题。首先，我没有装液体的盛具；虽然我有两只桶，但都装满了甘蔗酒。此外，还有几只玻璃瓶，有几只普通大小的，还有几只方形的，用来装了水和烈酒。我没有煮东西的锅子，只有一把大壶，那也是我从大船上取下来的。可是这壶太大，不适于用来烧汤或煮肉。其次，我需要一个烟斗，但一下子无法做出来。不过后来我还是想出办法做了一个。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在整个夏季，或者说是旱季，我忙于栽第二道木桩和编箩筐。同时，我进行了另一件工作，占去的时间比预料的多得多。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 前面曾经提到过，我一直想周游全岛。我先走到小溪尽头，最后到达我修筑乡间住宅的地方，在那儿有一片开阔地一直延伸到海岛另一头的海边。我决定先走到海岛那头的海岸边。我带上枪，斧头，狗，以及较多的火药子弹；另外还带了两大块干粮和一大包葡萄干。就这样我踏上了旅程。我穿过我那茅舍所在的山谷，向西眺望，看到了大海。这一天，天气晴朗，大海对面的陆地清晰可见。我不知道那是海岛，还是大陆；只见地势很高，从西直向西南偏西延伸，连绵不断；但距我所在的小岛很远，估计约有４５海里至６０海里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我不知道那是什么地方，估计是美洲的一部分吧。据我观察，靠近西班牙领地，也许上面都是野人的天下。要是当时我在那儿上岸，情况肯定比现在更糟。现在，我更愿听从天命，并感到这种安排是尽善尽美的。这样一想，我就感到心平气和了。我不再自寻烦恼，妄想到海对面的陆地上去了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 另外，我经过了一番思考，得出了如下的结论：如果这片陆地确实是属于西班牙领地的海岸，那迟早会有船只经过；如果没有船只在那边的海岸来往，那儿肯定是位于西班牙领地和巴西之间的蛮荒海岸，上面住着最野蛮的土人。这些土人都是吃人的野人。任何人落入他们的手里，都会给他们吃掉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我边想边缓步前进。我感到，我现在所在的小岛这边的环境，比我原来住的那边好多了。这儿草原开阔，绿草如茵，遍地的野花散发出阵阵芳香，且到处是茂密的树林。我看到许多鹦鹉，很想捉一只驯养起来，教它说话。经过一番努力，我用棍子打下了一只小鹦鹉。等它苏醒后，我把它带回了家。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但过了好多年，我才教会它说话，终于让它亲热地叫我的名字。后来，它曾差点儿把我吓死，不过说起来也十分有趣。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我对这次旅行感到十分满意。在地势较低的一片地方，我还发现了不少像野兔和狐狸似的动物。这两种动物我以前都未见到过。我打死了几只，但不想吃它们的肉。我没有必要冒险，因为不缺食物，更何况我的食物十分可口，尤其是山羊肉、鸽子和鳖这三种，再加上葡萄干。如果就每个人平均享用的食品数量而言，即使是伦敦利登赫尔菜场①，也不能提供更丰盛的筵席。虽然我境况悲惨，但还是应感激上天，因为我不但不缺食物，而且十分丰盛，甚至还有珍馐佳肴。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在这次旅行中，我一天走不到两英里远。我总是绕来绕去，往复来回，希望能有新的发现。因此，当我走到一个地方准备呆下来过夜时，人已感到十分困倦了。有时我爬到树上去睡；要是睡在地上，四周就插上一道木桩，或把木桩插在两颗树之间。这样，要是有野兽走近的话，就会先把我惊醒。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我一走到海边，便发现我住的那边是岛上环境最糟的地方，这真有点出乎我的意料。在这儿，海滩上龟鳖成群；而在我住的那边海边，一年半中我才找到了三只。此外，还有无数的飞禽，种类繁多；有些是我以前见过的，有些却从未见过。不少飞禽的肉都很好吃。在这么多飞禽中，我只认出一种叫企鹅的东西，其余的我都叫不上名字。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这儿鸟那么多，我本可以爱打多少就打多少，但我不想浪费弹药。要是能打到一只山羊就能吃得更好。可是，这儿山羊虽比我住的那边多，但因这一带地势平坦，稍一靠近它们就被发现，不像那边我埋伏在山上难以被山羊察觉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我承认这边比我住的地方好得多，但我无意搬家，因为我在那边已住惯了。这边再好，总觉得是在外地旅行，不是在家里。我沿着海边向东走，估计大约走了十二英里后，我在岸上竖了一根大柱子作为记号，便决定暂时回家。我准备下次旅行从家里出发，向相反方向走，沿海岸往东兜上一个圈子，回到这儿立柱子的地方。这些我后面再交待。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 回家时我走了另一条路。我以为，只要我注意全岛地势就不会迷路而找不到我在海边的居所。但我想错了。走了两三英里后，我发现自己进入了一个大山谷，四周群山环绕，山上丛林密布，除非看太阳才能辩出东西南北，可是此刻太阳也无助于辩别方向，因为我不知道是在上午、中午还是下午。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 更糟的是，在山谷里的三四天中，浓雾弥漫，不见阳光，我只得东撞西碰，最后不得不回到海边，找到了我竖起的那根柱子，再从原路往回走。我走走歇歇，慢慢回家里去。这时天气炎热，身上带着枪枝弹药以及斧头等东西，感到特别沉重。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 回家路上，我的狗袭击了一只小山羊，并把小羊抓住了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我连忙跑过去夺过小羊，把它从狗嘴里救了下来。我以前经常想到，要是能驯养几头山羊，让其繁殖，那么，到我弹尽粮绝时，可以杀羊充饥。因此，我决定把这头小山羊牵回家去饲养。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我给小羊做了个项圈，又用我一直带在身边的麻纱做了根细绳子，颇费了一翻周折才把羊牵回我的乡间住宅。我把小羊圈了起来就离开了。当时，我急于回老家，因离家已一个多月了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 回到老家，我躺在吊床上，心里有说不出的高兴和满足。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这次外出，作了一次小小的漫游，一直居无定所，总感到不称心。现在回到家里，跟出门在外的生活一比，更觉得这个家确实完满无缺，舒适安定。因此我决定，如果我命中注定要在这个岛上度过余生，以后就决不离家走太远了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我在家里呆了一星期，以便好好休息，恢复长途旅行的疲劳。在这期间，我做了一件大事，就是给抓到的那只小鹦鹉做了个笼子。这时，这只小鹦鹉已完全驯顺了，并且与我亲热起来。这件大事完成后，我想起了那只可怜的小山羊，它一直被关在我做的羊圈里。我决定去把它带回老家来。到了乡间住宅那边，见那小羊还在原来的圈里--事实上，它也不可能逃出来。因为没有东西吃，它差不多快饿死了。我出去到外面弄了点嫩枝嫩叶喂它。等它吃饱之后，我仍像原来那样用绳子牵着它走。然而，小羊因饥饿而变得十分驯服。我根本不必用绳牵它走，它就会像狗一样乖乖地跟在我后面。后来，我一直饲养它，它变得又温和又可爱，成了我家庭成员中的一员，从此再也没有离开我。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 时值秋分，雨季又来临了。九月三十日这一天，是我上岛的纪念日。像去年一样，我严肃虔诚地度过了这一天。我来到这岛上已两年了，但与两年前刚上岛时一样，毫无获救的希望。整整一天，我怀着谦卑和感激的心情，追念上帝给我的种种恩惠。如果没有这些恩惠，我孤寂的生活就会更凄苦了。我卑顺地、衷心地感谢上帝，因为上帝使我明白，尽管我目前过着孤单寂寞的生活，但也许比生活在自由快乐的人世间更幸福。上帝无时无刻不在我的身边，时时与我的灵魂交流，支持我，安慰我，鼓励我，让我信赖天命，并祈求他今后永与我同在。所有这一切，都足以弥补我寂寞生活中的种种不足。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 直到现在，我才充分意识到，我现在的生活比过去幸福得多。尽管我目前处境不幸，但我过去过的却是一种罪恶的、可憎的、令人诅咒的生活。我现在完全改变了对忧愁和欢乐的看法，我的愿望也大不相同，我的爱好和兴趣也变了。与初来岛上相比，甚至与过去两年相比，我获得了一种前所未有的欢乐。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 过去，当我到各处打猎，或勘查岛上环境时，一想到自己的处境，我的灵魂就会痛苦不堪；想到自己被困在这些树林、山谷和沙滩中间，被困在没有人烟的荒野里，我觉得自己就像是个囚犯，那茫茫的大海就是我牢狱的铁栅栏，并且永无出狱之日。一想到这些，我总是忧心如焚。即使在我心境最宁静的时候，这种念头也会像暴风雨一样突然向我袭来，使我扭扯双手，像小孩一样号啕痛哭。有时在劳动中，这种念头也会突然袭来。我就会立刻坐下来，长吁短叹，两眼死盯着地面，一两个小时一动也不动，这就更令人痛苦了。因为，假如我能哭出来，或用语言发泄出来，苦恼就会过去；悲哀发泄出来后，心情也会好一些。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可现在，我开始用新的思想修炼自己。我每天读《圣经》，并把读到的话与自己当前的处境相联系，以从中得到安慰。一天早晨，我心情十分悲凉。打开《圣经》，我读到了这段话：\"我决不撇下你，也不丢弃你。\"我立刻想到，这些话正是对我说的。否则，怎么会在我为自己的处境感到悲伤，在我感到自己被上帝和世人丢平时，让我读到这段话呢？\"好啊，\"我说，\"只要上帝不丢弃我，那么，即使世人丢弃我，那又有什么害处，又有什么关系呢？从另一方面来说，即使世人不丢弃我，但我若失去上帝的宠幸和保佑，还有什么能比这种损失更大呢？\"从这时期，我心里有了一种新的认识。我在这里虽然孤苦伶仃，但也许比我生活在世界上任何其他地方更幸福。有了这种认识，我禁不住衷心感激上帝，感谢他把我引导到这儿来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可是，一想到这里，不知怎么的，我心头突然一惊，再也不敢把感谢的话说出来。我大声对自己说：\"你怎么能做伪君子呢？你是在假装对自己的处境表示感激，因为你一面对目前的处境表示满足，一面却恨不得恳求上帝，把你从这里拯救出来。\"于是，我不再说话了。事实上，我虽然不能说我感谢上帝把我带到这儿来，但我还是要衷心感谢上帝，因为他用种种灾难折磨我，使我睁开眼睛，看清了我过去的生活，并为自己的罪恶而感到悲痛和后悔。我每次读《圣经》，总是衷心感谢上帝，是他引导我在英国的朋友把《圣经》放在我的货物里，虽然我没有嘱托他。我也感谢上帝，是他后来又帮助我把《圣经》从破船中取了出来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 就在这种心情下，我开始了荒岛上的第三年生活。我虽然没有把这一年的工作像第一年那样一件一件地给读者叙述，但一般说来，可以这么说，我很少有空闲的时候。对每天必不可少的日常工作，我都定时进行，生活很有规律。比如，第一，定出时间，一天三次祈祷上帝和阅读《圣经》；第二，带枪外出觅食。如果不下雨，一般在上午外出，时间约三小时；第三，把打死或捕获的猎物加以处理，或晒、或烤、或腌、或煮，以便收藏作为我的粮食。这些事差不多用去了每天大部分的时间。此外还必须考虑到，每天中午，太阳在天顶时，酷热难当，根本无法出门。因此，每天真正能够用来工作的时间，只有晚上四小时。不过，有时我也把打猎和工作的时间调换一下，上午工作，下午带枪外出。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 一天中能工作的时间太短。此外，我还得提一下我工作的艰苦性。因为缺乏工具，缺乏助手，缺乏经验，做每件工作都要浪费许多时间。例如，为了在我的洞室里做一个长架子，我花了整整四十二天的功夫才做成一块木板；而实际上，如果有两个锯木工在锯坑里用锯子锯，只要半天就能从同一棵树上锯出六块木板来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我做木板的方法是这样的：因为我需要一块较宽的木板，就选定一棵大树把它砍倒。砍树花了三天的时间，再花了两天把树枝削掉，这样树干就成了一根大木头，或者说是成了木材。然后用大量的时间慢慢劈削，把树干两边一点点地削平。削到后来，木头就轻了，这样就可以搬动了。然后把削轻的木头放在地上，先把朝上的一面从头至尾削光削平，像块木板的板面一样；再把削平的这一面翻下去，削另一面，最后削成三寸多厚两面光滑的木板。任何人都可以想象，做这样的工作，我得用双手付出多少劳力啊！但劳力和耐心终于使我完成了这件工作以及许多其他工作。我把做木板作为一个例子，说明为什么我花了那么多的时间只能完成很少的工作；同时也可以说明，做任何工作，如果有助手和工具，本来是一件轻而易举的事情，但若单凭一个人空手去做，便要花费大量的劳力和时间。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 尽管如此，靠了耐心和劳动，我完成了大量的工作。下面，我将叙述我如何为生活环境所迫，完成了许多必不可少的工作。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在正是十一、十二月之间，即将收获大麦和稻子。我耕种和施肥的面积不大，因为，上面说过，我所有的种子每样只不过半斗，而又因第一次在旱季播种，把播下去的种子完全毁了。但这一次却丰收在望。然而，我突然发现，庄稼受到好几种敌人的威胁，而且这些敌人简直难以对付。全部收获又将丧失殆荆首先，就是山羊和像野兔似的野物。它们尝到了禾苗的甜味后，等禾苗一长出来，就昼夜伏在田里，把长出地面的禾苗吃光，禾苗根本就无法长出茎秆来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 除了做个篱笆把庄稼地围起来，我想不出其他办法。我花了大量艰苦的劳动，才把篱笆筑好。尤其吃力的是，我必须很快把篱笆建成。好在我种子不多，因而耕种面积也不大，所以不到三星期我就把庄稼地围起来了。白天，我打死３只野物；晚上，我把狗拴在大门外的一根柱子上，让狗整夜吠叫，看守庄稼地。不久，那些敌人就舍弃了这块地方，庄稼长得又茁壮又好，并很快成熟起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在庄稼长出禾苗时，遭到了兽害；而现在庄稼结穗时，又遇到了鸟害。一天，我到田里去看看庄稼的生长情况，却发现无数的飞禽围住了我那块小小的庄稼地，飞禽种类之多，简直数不胜数。它们围着庄稼地，仿佛等我走开后就可飞进去饱餐一顿。我立刻向鸟群开了枪（我外出时是枪不离身的）。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 枪声一响，我又看到在庄稼地中无数的飞禽纷纷腾空而起，而刚才我还没有发现在庄稼地中竟也潜伏着这么一大群飞禽。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这使我非常痛心。可以预见，要不了几天，它们就会把我的全部希望吃个精光。我将无法耕种任何庄稼，到头来只好挨饿，而我又不知如何对付这些飞禽。但我决心不能让我的庄稼白白损失，即使整天整夜守着也在所不惜。我先走进庄稼地看看损失的情况，发现那些飞禽已糟蹋了不少庄稼，但大麦和稻子还都在发青期，所以损失还不大。假如我能把其余部分保住，还可能有一个不错的收成。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我站在庄稼地旁，把枪装上弹药。当我走开时，我清楚地看到那些偷谷贼都停在周围的树上，好像专等我走开似的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 事实也确实如此。我慢慢走远，假装已经离开。一旦它们看不见我了，就立即又一个个飞进庄稼地。见此情景，我气极了。等不及让更多的鸟飞下来，我就走到篱笆边开了一枪，一下子打死了三只。因为我知道，它们现在所吃掉的每一颗谷粒，几年后对我来说就是一大斗。鸟给打死了，这正是我所期望的。我把打死的鸟从地里拾起来，用英国惩治恶名昭著的窃贼的办法，把它们用锁链吊起来，以警效尤。真想不到，这个办法居然十分灵光。从此以后，那些飞禽不仅不敢再到庄稼地来，甚至连岛上的这一边也不敢飞来了。在那些示众的死鸟挂在那儿期间，附近连一只鸟都看不见。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 不用说，这件事使我很高兴。十二月底，是一年中的第二个收获季节，我收割了我的庄稼。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 要收割庄稼，就得有镰刀；可是我没有，这就难为我了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 无奈之中，只得用一把腰刀来改做；这种腰刀是我从船上的武器舱中取出来的。好在第一次收成不多，所以割起来也没多大困难。而且，我收割的方法也非常独特：只割下麦穗或稻穗，把茎干留下来。我把穗子装进自制的大筐子里搬回家，再用双手把谷粒搓下来。收获完毕后，我发现原来的半斗种子差不多打了两斗稻和两斗半多的大麦。这当然只是我估计估计罢了，因为当时手头根本就没有量具。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这对我是一个极大的鼓励。我预见到，早晚有一天，上帝会赐给我面包吃。可是，现在我又感到为难了。因为我既不知道怎样把谷粒磨成粉，甚至根本不知道怎样脱谷，怎样筛去秕糠；即使能把谷粒磨成粉，我也不知道怎样把粉做成面包；即使做成了面包，也不知怎样烤面包。另外，我想多积一点粮食，以保证不断供应。为此，我决定不吃这次收获的谷物，而是全部留起来做种子，待下一季再播种。同时，我决定用全部时间全力研究磨制面粉和烤制面包这一艰巨的工作。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 人们常说\"为面包而工作\"，其意思是\"为生存而工作\"。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 而现在，我可以说是真的为\"面包\"而工作了。为了制成面包这样小小的不起眼的东西，你首先得作好播种准备，生产出粮食，再要经过晒、筛、制、烤等种种奇怪而繁杂的必不可少的过程，真不能不令人惊叹。我也想，很少人会想到，我们天天吃的面包要真的自己动手从头做起是多么不容易啊！ \\n\\n \\n\\n 目前，我犹如初生的婴孩，除了自己一身之外，别无他物。做面包的事成了天天苦恼我的心玻而且，自从我第一次无意中发现在石壁下长出稻子和大麦，并获得了一把粮种之后，随着时光的流逝，我简直无时无刻不想到做面包的事。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 首先，我没有犁，无法耕地；也没有锄头或铲子来掘地。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这个困难我克服了，前面提到，我做了一把木头铲子。工具拙劣，干起活来很不得力。虽然我花了不少日子才做成一把木铲，但因为没有铁，很快就磨损了。结果工作更加困难，效率也更低。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 尽管如此，我还是将就着使用这把木铲；我耐着性子用木铲掘地，即使效果不佳也不在意。种子播下后，我又没有耙，不得不自己在地里走来走去，或用一颗大树在地里拖来拖去。这样做与其说是在耙地，还不如说是在扒地。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在庄稼成长和成熟的时候，我前面也已谈到，还有许多事要做。我要给庄稼地打上篱笆，又要保护庄稼不受鸟害。然后是收割、晒干、运回家、打谷、簸去秕糠，而后把谷物收藏起来。然而，我没有磨，无法磨谷；我没有筛子，无法筛粉；我没有发醇粉和盐，无法做面包；我也没有炉子烤面包。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 所有这一切，我都一无所有，但我还是做成了面包。这些事我将在下面再告诉读者。但在当时，我总算有了自己的粮食，这对我是极大的安慰，为我的生活带来了更多有利的条件。前面提到，没有适当的工具，一切事情做起来特别吃力，特别费时间，可是也没有办法。同时，我也没有浪费时间。我把时间分配得很好，每天安排出一定的时间来做这些事。我已决定等我收获了更多的粮食后再做面包，所以我还有六个月的时间；在这半年中，我可以运用我全部的精力和心血，设法制造出加工粮食各项工序所需要的各种工具。到时，有了足够的粮食，就可以用来制造面包了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 目前，第一步，我必须多准备一点土地，因为我现在有了足够的种子，可以播种一英亩还多。在耕地之前，我至少花了一个星期，做了一把铲子。铲子做得又拙劣，又笨重，拿它去掘地，要付出双倍的劳力。但不管怎么说，我总算有了掘地的工具，并在我住所附近找了两大片平地把种子播下去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 然后就是修筑了一道坚实的篱笆把地围起来，篱笆的木桩都是从我以前栽过的那种树上砍下来的。我知道这种树生长很快，一年内就能长成茂密的篱笆，用不着多少工夫去修理。这个工作花了我三个多月的时间，因为这期间大部分时间是雨季，我无法出门，故修筑篱笆的事时辍时续。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在家里，也就是说，在下雨不能出门的时候，我也找些事情做。我一面工作，一面同我的鹦鹉闲扯，以教它说话作为消遣。不久，我就教会它知道它自己叫什么，后来它居然会响亮地叫自己为\"波儿\"。这是我上岛以来第一次从别的嘴里听到的话。教鹦鹉说话，当然不是我的工作，只是工作中的消遣而已。前面谈到，我目前正在着手一件重要的工作。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我早就想用什么办法制造一些陶器，我急需这类东西，可就是不知怎么做。这里气候炎热，因此，我敢肯定，只要能找到陶土，就能做一些钵子或罐子，然后放到太阳底下晒干；炎热的太阳一定能把陶土晒得既坚硬又结实，并能经久耐用，可以用来装一些需要保存的干东西。要加工粮食，制造面粉等工作，就必需要有盛器贮藏。所以，我决定尽量把容器做大一些，可以着地放，里面就可以装东西。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 要是读者知道我怎样制造这些陶器，一定会为我感到又可怜又可笑。我不知用了多少笨拙的方法去调合陶土，也不知做出了多少奇形怪状的丑陋的家伙；有多少因为陶土太软，吃不住本身的重量，不是凹进去，就是凸出来。根本不合用；又有多少因为晒得太早，太阳热力过猛而晒裂了；也有多少在晒干后一搬动就碎裂了。一句话，我费了很大的力气去找陶土，找到后把土挖出来，调合好，运回家，再做成泥瓮。结果，我工作了差不多两个月的时间，才做成两只大瓦罐，样子非常难看，简直无法把它们叫作缸。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后，太阳终于把这两只大瓦罐晒得非常干燥非常坚硬了。我就把它们轻轻搬起来，放进两只预先特制的大柳条筐里，防备它们破裂。在缸和筐子之间的空隙处，又塞上了稻草和麦秆。现在，这两个大缸就不会受潮，以后我想就可以用来装粮食和粮食磨出来的面粉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我大缸做得不成功，但那些小器皿却做得还像样，像那些小圆罐啦，盘子啦，水罐啦，小瓦锅啦等等，总之，一切我随手做出来的东西，都还不错，而且，由于阳光强烈，这些瓦罐都晒得特别坚硬。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但我还没有达到我的最终目的。这些容器只能用来装东西，不能用来装流质放在火上烧，而这才是我真正的目的。过了些时候，一次我偶然生起一大堆火煮东西，煮完后我就去灭火，忽然发现火堆里有一块陶器的碎片，被火烧得像石头一样硬，像砖一样红。这一发现使我惊喜万分。我对自己说，破陶器能烧，整只陶器当然也能烧了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是我开始研究如何控制火力，给自己烧出几只锅子来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我当然不知道怎样搭一个窑，就像那些陶器工人烧陶器用的那种窑；我也不知道怎样用铅去涂上一层釉，虽然铅我还是有一些的。我把三只大泥锅和两三只泥罐一个个堆起来，四面架上木柴，泥锅和泥罐下生了一大堆炭火，然后在四周和顶上点起了火，一直烧到里面的罐子红透为止，而且十分小心不让火把它们烧裂。我看到陶器烧得红透后，又继续保留了五六小时的热度。后来，我看见其中一只虽然没有破裂，但已开始溶化了，这是因为掺在陶土里的沙土被火烧溶了，假如再烧下去，就要成为玻璃了。于是我慢慢减去火力，那些罐子的红色逐渐退去。我整夜守着火堆，不让火力退得太快。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 到了第二天早晨，我便烧成了三只很好的瓦锅和两只瓦罐，虽然谈不上美观，但很坚硬；其中一只由于沙土被烧溶了，还有一层很好的釉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这次实验成功后，不用说，我不缺什么陶器用了。但我必须说，这些东西的形状，是很不像样的。大家也可以想象，因为我没有办法制造这些东西，只能像小孩子做泥饼，或像不会和面粉的女人做馅饼那样去做。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 当我发现我已制成了一只能耐火的锅子时，我的快乐真是无可比拟的，尽管这是一件多么微不足道的事情。我等不及让锅子完全冷透，就急不可耐地把其中一只放到火上，倒进水煮起肉来。结果效果极佳。我用一块小山羊肉煮了一碗可口的肉汤。当然，我没有燕麦粉和别的配料，否则我会做出非常理想的汤来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 下一个问题是我需要一个石臼舂粮食。因为我明白，仅凭自己的一双手，是无法做出石磨的。至于如何做石臼，我也一筹莫展。三百六十行中，我最不懂的就是石匠手艺了，更何况没有合适的工具。我费了好几天的功夫，想找一块大石头，把中间挖空后做个石臼。可是岛上尽是大块岩石，根本无法挖凿，而且石质不硬，是一些一碰就碎的沙石，经不住重锤去舂，而且即使能捣碎谷物，也必然会从石臼中舂出许多沙子和在面粉里。因此，当我花了很长时间找不到适当的石料时，就放弃了这个念头，决定找一大块硬木头。这要容易得多。我弄了一块很大的木头，大得我勉强能搬得动。然后用大斧小斧把木头砍圆；当起初具圆形时，就用火在上面烧一个槽。火力和无限的劳力，就像巴西的印第安人做独木舟那样终于把臼做成了。又用铁树做了一个又大又重的杵。舂谷的工具做好后，我就放起来准备下次收获后舂谷做面粉，再用面粉做面包。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二个需要克服的困难是，我得做一个筛子筛面粉，把面粉和秕糠分开。没有筛子，就无法做面包。做筛子想想也把我难倒了。我没有任何材料可以用来做筛子，也就是那种有很细很细网眼的薄薄的布可以把面粉筛出来。这使我停工好几个月，不知怎么办才好。除了一些破布碎片外，我连一块亚麻布也没有。虽然我有山羊毛，但我根本不知道怎样纺织，即使知道，这里也没有纺织工具。后来，我忽然想起一个补救办法，也是当时唯一的办法，那就是在从船上搬下来的那些水手衣服里，有几块棉布和薄纱围巾。我拿了几块出来做成三个小筛子，总算能凑合着用，这样应付了好几年。至于后来怎么办，我下面再叙述。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 下一步要考虑的是制面包的问题，也就是我有了粮食之后怎样制成面包。首先，我没有发酵粉。这是绝对没有办法做出来的，所以我也就不去多费脑筋了。至于炉子的问题，颇费了我一番周折。但最后，我还是想出了一个试验的办法。具体做法如下：我先做了些很大的陶器，但不太深；这些容器直径有两英尺，但深仅九英寸。像上次烧制陶器那样，我把它们也放在火里烧过，完工后就成了大瓦盆，放置一边备用。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 制面包时，我先用方砖砌成一个炉子；这些方砖也是我自己烧制出来的，只不过不怎么方整罢了。然后，在炉子里生起火。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 当木柴烧成热炭或炽炭时，我就把它们取出来放在炉子上面，并把炉子盖满，让炉子烧得非常热。然后把所有的火种通通扫尽，把面包放进去，再用做好的大瓦盆把炉子扣住，瓦盆上再盖满火种。这样做不但能保持炉子的热度，还能增加热度。用这种方法，我制出了非常好的大麦面包，绝不亚于世界上最好的炉子制出来的面包。不久之后，我就成了一个技术高明的面包师傅，因为我还用大米制成了一些糕点和布叮不过，我没有做过馅饼，因为除了飞禽和山羊肉外，我没有别的佐料可以放进去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 毫不奇怪，这些事情占去了我在岛上第三年的大部分时间。一方面，我要为制面包做许多事情；另一方面，我还要料理农务，收割庄稼。我按时收获，把谷物都运回家。我把穗子放在大筐子里，有空时就用双手搓出来。因为我既无打谷场，也无打谷的工具。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，我的粮食贮藏量大大增加了，就必须扩建谷仓。我需要有地方来存放粮食。现在，我已有了二十浦式耳大麦和二十多浦式耳大米，可以放心吃用了，因为我从船上取下来的粮食早就吃完了。同时，我也想估算一下，一年要消耗多少粮食，然后准备一年只种一季，数量足够我吃就行了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我发现，四十浦式耳的大麦和大米足够我吃一年还有余。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 因此我决定每年播种同样数量的种子，并希望收获的粮食足够供应我做面包和其他用途。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 毫无疑问，在做上述那些事情的同时，我常想到我在岛上另一边所看到的陆地。我心里暗暗怀着一种愿望，希望能在那里上岸，并幻想自己在找到大陆和有人烟的地方后，就能继续设法去其他地方，最终能找到逃生的办法。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 那时，我完全没有考虑这种情况的危险性，没有考虑到我会落入野人的手里，而这些野人比非洲的狮子和老虎还要凶残，我一旦落入他们的手里，就要冒九死一生的危险，不是给他们杀死，就是给他们吃掉。我听说，加勒比海沿岸的人都是吃人的部族。而从纬度来看，我知道我目前所在的这个荒岛离加勒比海岸不会太远。再说，就算他们不是吃人的部族，他们也一定会把我杀掉。他们正是这样对待落到他们手里的欧洲人的，即使一二十个欧洲人成群结伙也难免厄运。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 而我只是孤身一人，毫无自卫的能力。这些情况我本来应该好好考虑的，可是在当时却丝毫也没有使我害怕，尽管后来我还是考虑到了这种危险性。那时我头脑里考虑的只是怎样登上对面的陆地。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，我怀念起我那小仆人佐立和那只长舢船了；我和佐立驾着那挂着三角帆的舢船沿非洲海岸航行了一千多英里啊！然而，光思念也于事无补。所以，我想到去看看我们大船上的那只小艇。前面已谈到过，这小艇是在我们最初遇难时被风暴刮到岸上来的。小艇差不多还躺在原来的地方，但位置略有变更，并且经风浪翻了个身，船底朝天，搁浅在一个高高的沙石堆上，四面无水。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 如果我有助手，就可以把船修理一下放到水里，那就一定能坐着它回巴西。在当时，我应该考虑到，凭我一个人的力量，是绝对不可能把这小艇翻个身，让它船底朝下，就像我无法搬动这座岛一样。我只是一心想把船翻个身，然后把受损的地方修好，成为一条不错的船，可以乘着它去航海，所以我还是走进树林，砍了一些树干想做杠杆或转木之用。然后把这些树干运到小艇旁，决定尽我所能试试看。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 我不遗余力去干这件工作，最后只是白费心思和力气，却浪费了我整整三四个星期的时间。后来，我终于意识到，我的力气是微不足道的，根本不可能把小艇抬起。于是，我不得不另想办法，着手挖小艇下面的沙子，想把下面挖空后让小艇自己落下去；同时，用一些木头从下面支撑着，让小艇落下来时翻个身。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 船是落下来了，我却无法搬动它，也无法从船底下插入杠杆转木之类的东西，更不要说把它移到水里去了。最后，我只得放弃这个工作。可是，我虽然放弃了使用小艇的希望，我要去海岛对面大陆上的愿望不但没有减退，反而因为无法实现而更加强烈。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后，我想到，能否像热带地区的土人那样做一只独木舟呢，尽管我没有工具，没有人手。所谓独木舟，就是用一棵大树的树干做成的。我觉得这不但可能，而且很容易做到。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 做独木舟的想法，使我非常高兴。而且，我还认为，与黑人或印第安人相比，我还有不少有利条件。但我却完全没有想到，比起印第安人来，我还有许多特别不利的条件，那就是，独木舟一旦做成后，没有人手可以帮我让独木舟下水。是的，印第安人有印第安人的困难，他们没有工具，但是，我缺少人手的困难更难克服。如果我能在树林里找到一棵大树，费了很大的劲把树砍倒，再用我的工具把树的外部砍成小舟形状，然后把里面烧空或凿空，做成一只小船；假如这些工作全部完成后，小船仍不得不留在原地而无法下水，那对我又有什么用处呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 人们也许会想到，我在做这小船时，不可能一点也不想到我所处的环境；我应该立即想到小舟下海的问题。可是，我当时一心一意只想乘小舟去航行，从不考虑怎样使小舟离开陆地的问题。而实际上，对我来说，驾舟在海上航行四十五英里，比在陆地上使它移动四十五浔后让它下水要容易得多。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 任何有头脑的人都不会像我这样傻就着手去造船。我对自己的计划十分得意，根本不去仔细想想计划的可行性。虽然我也想到船建成后下水可能是一大难题，但对于自己的疑惑，我总是愚蠢地认为：\"把船造好了再说。到时总会想出办法的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"这是最荒谬的办法。我真是思船心切，立即着手工作。我砍倒了一棵大柏树。我相信，连所罗门造耶路撒冷的圣殿时也没有用过这样大的木料。靠近树根的直径达五英尺十英寸，在二十二英尺处直径也达四英尺十一英寸，然后才渐渐细下去，并开始长出枝叉。我费尽辛苦才把树砍倒：用二十二天时间砍断根部，又花了十四天时间使用大斧小斧砍掉树枝和向四周张开的巨大的树顶；这种劳动之艰辛真是一言难荆然后，又花了一个多月的时间又砍又削，最后刮出了船底的形状，使其下水后能浮在水上。这时，树干已砍削得初具船的形状了。接着又花了将近三个月的时间把中间挖空，做得完全像只小船。在挖空树干时，我不用火烧，而是用槌子和凿子一点一点地凿空，最后确实成了一只像模像样的独木舟，大得可乘26个人。这样，不仅我自己可以乘上船，而且可以把我所有的东西都装进去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这项工程完成后，我心里高兴极了。这艘小船比我以前看到过的任何独木舟都大。当然，做成这只大型独木舟我是费尽心血的。现在，剩下的就是下水问题了。要是我的独木舟真的下水了，我肯定会进行一次有史以来最为疯狂、最不可思议的航行了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 尽管我想尽办法，费尽力气，可就是无法使船移动一步。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 小船所在的位置离水仅一百码，决不会再多。第一个难处是，从小船所在的位置到河边，正好是一个向上的斜坡。为此，我决定把地面掘起，掘出一个向下的斜坡。于是，我立即动手进行这项工程，并且也历尽艰辛。当想到有可能逃生的机会，谁还会顾得上艰难困苦呢？不料完成了这项工程，克服了这一障碍后，我还是一筹莫展。我根本无力移动这只独木舟一步，就像我无法移动搁浅在沙滩上的那只小艇一样。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 既然我无法使独木舟下水，就只得另想办法。我把现场的距离丈量了一下，决定开个船坞或开条运河，把水引到船底下来。于是我又着手这项大工程。一开始，我就进行了一些估算：看看运河要挖多深多宽，怎样把挖出来的土运走。结果发现，若我一个人进行这项工程，至少要花十至十二年。因为河岸很高，达二十英尺。最后，我不得不放弃这个计划，尽管心里很不愿意。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这件事使我非常伤心。到这时我才明白--虽然为时已晚--做任何事，若不预先计算一下所需的代价，不正确估计一下自己力量，那是十分愚蠢的！ \\n\\n \\n\\n 这项工作进行到一半，我也结束了荒岛上第四年的生活。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 和以往一样，我以虔诚和欣慰的心情，度过了我上岛的周年纪念日。我常常阅读《圣经》，并认真付诸实践，再加上上帝对我的恩宠，我获得了前所未有的全新的认识。对我来说，世界是遥远的；我对它已没有任何关系，也没有任何期望。可以说，我于世无求。总之，我与世界已无什么牵连，而且以后也不会再发生什么关系。因此，我对世界的看法，就像我们离开人世后对世界的看法一样：这是我曾经居住过的地方，但现在已经离开了。我完全可以用亚伯拉罕对财主说的那句话：\"你我中间隔着一条深渊。\"首先，我在这里摆脱了一切人世间的罪恶。我既无\"肉体的欲望、视觉的贪欲，也无人生的虚荣\"。我一无所求，因为，我所有的一切，已尽够我享受了。我是这块领地的主人，假如我愿意，我可以在我占有的这片国土上封王称帝。我没有敌人，也没有竞争者与我来争权争势。我可以生产出整船的粮食，可是这对我没有用处，我只要生产足够我吃用的粮食就行了。
