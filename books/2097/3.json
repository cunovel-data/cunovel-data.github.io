{"id":90560,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"Jacinth! Are you in there? Jacinth!\" Cassie blinked in the bright sunlight. She\u0027d seen this room before. It was her grandmother\u0027s kitchen - except that it wasn\u0027t. The walls of her grandmother\u0027s kitchen were sagging and dingy; these were straight and clean. Her grandmother\u0027s hearth was stained with the smoke of centuries; this hearth looked almost new and was a slightly different shape. The iron hook for hanging pots on shone. It was the room in her dream, the dream she\u0027d had the last time she spent the night at Diana\u0027s house. The low chair she was sitting in was the same. But this dream seemed to be picking up where the other had left off. \"Jacinth, have you fallen asleep with your eyes open? Kate is here!\" A feeling of anticipation and excitement filled Cassie. Kate; who was Kate? Without even knowing why, she found herself standing up, and she realized that she was wearing a dress that brushed the tips of her neat brocade shoes. The red leather Book of Shadows fell from her lap to the ground. She turned toward the voice, toward what would have been the side door of her grandmother\u0027s house. In this house it seemed to be the front door. It was filled with sunlight, and there were two figures standing there. One was tall, with a silhouette like the engravings of Puritan women she\u0027d seen in history books. The other was smaller, with shining hair. Cassie couldn\u0027t see either of the figures\u0027 faces, but the smaller one was holding out eager hands to her. Cassie reached for them, stepping forward - - and the dream changed. It was dark and she could hear the tortured scream of wood being ripped asunder. Salt spray stung her face and her eyes struggled vainly to pierce the darkness. The ship was going down. Lost, all lost. And the Master Tools were lost as well - for now. But only for now. The savage determination of the thought filled Cassie and she tasted bile at the back of her throat. Even as icy water rushed around her legs she felt the dream lose focus. She tried to hang on to it, but it melted and shifted around her, and the darkness of the turbulent, stormy night became the quiet darkness of Diana\u0027s room. She was awake. And relieved beyond reason just to be alive. It wasn\u0027t really so dark in here. Dawn was brightening the curtains, turning the room gray. Diana was sleeping peacefully beside her. How could Diana be peaceful after all that had happened? After what Diana had learned about her best friend and her boyfriend, after losing the leadership of the coven, how could Diana sleep at all? But the dark lashes on Diana\u0027s cheek were still and serene and there was no bitterness in Diana\u0027s face. She\u0027s so good. I could never be that good, Cassie thought. Not if I tried all my life. Still, just being near Diana made her feel better. Cassie knew she wasn\u0027t going to sleep anymore. She sat back against the headboard and thought. God, she was glad to have things right with Diana again. And with Adam - Cassie was almost afraid to think of Adam, worried about what kind of pain it would bring. But although there was a deep-down ache at the picture of him, it was not unbearable, and the poison of jealousy and anger was truly gone. She honestly wanted him and Diana to be happy. She was a different person from the one who\u0027d burned with the frustration of not being able to have him these last six weeks. She\u0027d done a lot of strange things in the last six weeks, so many that she hardly knew herself anymore. 1 can\u0027t believe it, she thought; I went out and stole pumpkins with Chris and Doug in Salem. I drove that dog off Chris - that wasn\u0027t like me at all. 1 played Pizza Man with Faye. I went on that wild motorcycle ride with Deborah ... well, that wasn\u0027t so bad. A lot of things she\u0027d done in the last month weren\u0027t all bad. The lying and deception and guilt had been awful, but some of the changes had been good. She\u0027d gotten closer to Deborah and Suzan, and she\u0027d gained some insight into what made the Henderson brothers tick. Even Nick - she thought she understood him better now. And she\u0027d found strength in herself she\u0027d never thought she had. Strength to chase the shadowy thing in the cemetery - Black John? - after Jeffrey\u0027s death, strength to ask a boy to a dance, strength, in the end, to stand up to Faye. She only hoped it was enough strength to stand up to the days ahead. Cassie hadn\u0027t been to the old science building since Faye had lured her there and held her hostage, that first week of school. It was just as dark and unsafe-looking as she remembered. She had no idea why Faye had wanted them to meet here, except that this was Faye\u0027s territory, while the beach had always been Diana\u0027s. It was strange to see Faye in Diana\u0027s place, standing in front of the group with all eyes on her. Faye was wearing ordinary clothes today, black leggings and a red and black striped sweater, but a mysterious aura of leadership still clung to her. As she paced, her star rubies flashed in the shafts of sunlight that came through the boarded-up windows. \"I believe it was Cassie who wanted this meeting called. She said there was a lot she had to tell us - right, Cassie?\" \"About what my grandmother said before she died,\" Cassie said steadily, looking Faye in the eyes. \"Before Black John killed her.\" If she\u0027d expected Faye to be abashed, she was disappointed; those hooded golden eyes remained level and arrogant. Apparently Faye took no responsibility for the actions of Black John, even though she was the one who\u0027d arranged for him to be set free. \"Was it really Black John?\" Suzan said doubtfully, putting a exquisitely manicured fingernail to her perfect mouth, as if thinking was a new and difficult exercise. \"Was he really there?\" \"He was really there. He is really here,\" Cassie said. Suzan wasn\u0027t as stupid as she acted, and sometimes she had surprising insights. Cassie wanted her on their side. \"He came out of that mound in the cemetery. It was his grave, I guess. When we brought the skull to the cemetery and released the dark energy, it gave him the strength to come back.\" \"Back from the dead?\" Sean asked nervously. Before Cassie could answer, Melanie said, \"That mound couldn\u0027t have been Black John\u0027s grave, Cassie. I\u0027m sorry, but it just couldn\u0027t. It\u0027s far too modern.\" \"I know it\u0027s modern. It\u0027s not Black John\u0027s first grave; I don\u0027t even know if he had a grave in the 1600s. I guess not if he died at sea ...\" There were startled looks from some of the group, but Cassie scarcely noticed. \"Anyway, it\u0027s not his grave from then. It\u0027s his grave from 1976.\" Laurel, who was pouring a thermos cup of herbal tea, sloshed hot liquid on the floor. Faye stopped dead. \"What?\" she snarled. Even Diana and Adam looked disconcerted, glancing at each other. But support came from an unexpected quarter. \"Just let her tell the story,\" Deborah said. Thumbs hooked in her jeans pockets, she moved to where Cassie was sitting on an overturned crate, and stood beside her. Cassie took a deep breath. \"I knew something was weird when I saw all those graves in the cemetery - graves of your parents, all killed in 1976. Diana said it was a hurricane, but it still seemed strange to me. I mean, why were only parents dead? Especially when I learned that you\u0027d all been born just a few months before. With all those little babies, you\u0027d think some of them would have died in an ordinary hurricane. That\u0027s not even to mention the weirdness of all of you being born within a one-month period.\" She was relaxing a little now, although it was difficult to talk with everyone looking at her. At least their eyes weren\u0027t glinting with enmity and suspicion today. Only Faye looked hostile, standing with her arms folded across her chest, her feline eyes narrowed. \"But you see, the explanation for all of it is really simple,\" Cassie went on. \"Black John came back during the last generation, our parents\u0027 generation. Nobody knew it was him, and my grandmother said nobody could ever figure out how he came back, but it was Black John. He tried to make our parents into a coven when they were just a little older than us.\" \"Our parents?\" Doug asked, snickering. \"C\u0027mon, Cassie, give us a break.\" There were chuckles from others in the audience, and the expressions ranged from skeptical to troubled to openly mocking. \"No, wait,\" Adam said, beginning to look excited. \"There are some things that that would explain. I know my grandmother wanders in her mind now and then? but she\u0027s said things to me about my parents - about us kids forming a coven - that just might fit.\" His blue-gray eyes were snapping with intensity. \"Here\u0027s something else,\" Deborah said, looking sideways at Nick. \"Cassie\u0027s grandma said my mom was going to marry Nick\u0027s dad, but Black John made her marry my dad instead. That might explain why my mom freaks when you even mention magic, and why she always looks kind of guilty when she says Nick is growing up to look just like his father. It might explain a lot.\" Cassie noticed Nick, who was standing apart from the group as usual, in a dark corner. He was staring at the floor so hard, his eyes seemed to be about to bore a hole through it. \"Yeah, it might,\" he said so softly Cassie could barely hear the words. She wondered what he meant. \"It would explain why they yell at each other all the time, too - my parents, I mean,\" Deborah was adding. \"All parents yell all the time,\" Chris said with a shrug. \"All the parents around here are the ones who survived Black John,\" said Cassie. \"They survived because they didn\u0027t go to fight him. My grandmother said that after eleven babies were born in one month, our parents realized what Black John was up to. He wanted a coven he could control completely, a coven of kids he could mold while they were growing up. You guys\" - Cassie nodded around the group - \"were going to be his coven.\" The members of the Club looked at one another. \"But what about you, Cassie?\" Laurel asked. \"I wasn\u0027t born until later. Neither was Kori, you know. We weren\u0027t part of Black John\u0027s plans; we were just regular kids. But you guys were going to be his. He arranged everything about you.\" \"And the parents who didn\u0027t like that idea went to fight Black John,\" Deborah put in. \"They killed him; they burned him and the house at Number Thirteen, but they died themselves doing it. The ones that are alive are the cowards who stayed at home.\" \"Like my father,\" Suzan said abruptly, looking up from her nails. \"He gets really nervous if you mention the Vietnam Memorial or the Titanic or anything about anybody dying to save other people. And he won\u0027t talk about my mom.\" Cassie saw startled looks around the Circle. There was a kind of recognition in many of the members\u0027 eyes. \"Like my dad,\" Diana said wonderingly. \"He always talks about my mother being so brave, but he\u0027s never said exactly why. No wonder, if he didn\u0027t go, if he let her go alone.\" She bit her lip, distressed. \"What a horrible thing to find out about your own father.\" \"Yeah, well, I\u0027ve got it worse,\" Deborah said, looking grim. \"Both my parents didn\u0027t go. And neither did yours,\" she added to the Hendersons, who looked at each other and scowled. \"While those of us with no parents are lucky?\" Melanie asked, raising her eyebrows. \"At least you know they had guts,\" Deborah said shortly. \"You and Adam and Laurel and Nick have something to be proud of. I\u0027d rather be raised by a grandmother or a great-aunt than have parents who scream at each other all the time because they\u0027re so ashamed of themselves.\" Cassie was watching Nick again, and she saw something leave his face, some tension that had been there ever since she\u0027d known him. It made him look different, softer somehow, more vulnerable. At that moment he raised his eyes and met hers, catching her in the act of watching him. Cassie wanted to look away, but she couldn\u0027t, and to her surprise there was no hostility in his gaze. His mouth crooked slightly in a wry, relieved smile, and she found herself almost smiling back in sympathy. Then she realized Faye was looking at them. Turning back, she spoke quickly to the entire group. \"The ones who died were killed because our parents didn\u0027t all stick together. That\u0027s what my grandmother said, anyway. She said that we were the ones in danger now, because Black John\u0027s come to take us back. He still wants his coven, and now he\u0027s alive again - a living, breathing man. She said that he won\u0027t look burned and awful when we see him again, and we might not recognize him, but we have to be ready for him.\" \"Why?\" Adam asked, his level voice seeming loud in the sudden silence. \"Just what did she think he\u0027s going to do?\" Cassie lifted her hands. There was no longer a guilty secret between her and Adam, but every time she looked at him, she felt - a connection. A new connection, that of two people who\u0027d been tried by fire and had come out stronger. There would always be an understanding between them. \"I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s going to do,\" she told Adam. \"Fool us, my grandma said. Get us to follow him the way our parents did. But how, I don\u0027t know.\" \"The reason 1 ask is because he may not want all of us,\" Adam said, still quietly. \"You said he arranged for the eleven of us to be born - and if he joins the coven as its leader, that makes twelve. But you weren\u0027t one of the eleven, Cassie. Neither was Kori. And it looks like he got Kori out of the way.\" Diana drew in a sharp breath. \"Oh, my God - Cassie! You\u0027ve got to leave. You\u0027ve got to get out of New Salem, go back to California - \" She stopped, because Cassie was shaking her head. \"I can\u0027t,\" Cassie said simply. \"My grandma told me I had to stay and fight. She said that was why my mom brought me back, so I could fight him. I may be half outsider, but I guess I\u0027m one kid he didn\u0027t plan, so maybe I have some kind of advantage.\" \"Don\u0027t be modest,\" Deborah broke in caustically. \"The old lady told us it was because your family was always the strongest. You\u0027ve got the clearest sight and the most power, she said.\" \"And I\u0027ve got our Book of Shadows, now,\" Cassie said, somewhat embarrassed, bending to take the red leather book out of her backpack. \"My grandmother had it hidden behind a loose brick in the kitchen fireplace. Black John wanted it, so there must be something in it that he\u0027s afraid of. I\u0027m going to read it and try to find out what that something is.\" \"What can the rest of us do?\" Laurel asked. Cassie realized the question was directed at her; except for Faye, who was glowering, they were all looking at her expectantly. Flustered, she lifted her hands again and shook her head. \"We can talk to the old ladies in the town who\u0027re still alive,\" Deborah suggested. \"That\u0027s my idea, anyway. Cassie\u0027s grandma said our parents have forgotten about magic, that they made themselves forget to survive. But I figure the old ladies might not have forgotten, and we can question them. Like Laurel\u0027s Granny Quincey, and Adam\u0027s grandma, old Mrs. Franklin. Even your great-aunt, Mel.\" Melanie looked doubtful. \"Great-aunt Constance doesn\u0027t approve of the old ways at all. She\u0027s pretty - inflexible - about it.\" \"And Granny Quincey is so frail,\" Laurel said. \"As for old Mrs. Franklin - well, she\u0027s not always all there.\" \"To put it tactfully,\" Adam said. \"Let\u0027s face it, my grandmother can get pretty loopy at times. But I think Deborah\u0027s right; they\u0027re all we\u0027ve got, so we have to make the most of them. We can try to pump some parents for information, too . . . what have we got to lose?\" \"An arm and an eye, if it\u0027s my father you\u0027re pumping,\" Suzan muttered, holding her fingers in a shaft of sunlight to examine her nails. But Chris and Doug Henderson grinned wildly and said they\u0027d be happy to interrogate all the parents. \"We\u0027ll say, \u0027Hey, -remember that guy you fried like Freddy Krueger sixteen years ago? Well, he\u0027s back, so can you, like, give us any help in recognizing him?\u0027\" Doug said with relish. \"Didn\u0027t your grandma say anything that might help?\" Laurel asked Cassie. \"No . . . wait.\" Cassie straightened up, excitement stirring inside her. \"She said they identified Black John\u0027s body in the burned house because of his ring, a lodestone ring.\" She looked at Melanie. \"You\u0027re the crystal expert; so what\u0027s lodestone?\" \"It\u0027s magnetite, black iron oxide,\" Melanie said, her cool gray eyes narrowed thoughtfully. \"It\u0027s like hematite, which is iron oxide too, but hematite\u0027s blood-red when you cut it in thin slices. Magnetite is black and magnetic.\" Cassie tried to control her expression. Well, she\u0027d known the hematite came from Black John\u0027s house; maybe it had even been his stone. She shouldn\u0027t be surprised that he wore a ring of something similar. Still, she felt a twinge of apprehension. She\u0027d really better get rid of that piece of hematite. Right now it was sitting in a jewelry box in her bedroom, where she\u0027d put it when Diana drove her over to her house to pick up her clothes this morning before school. \"Okay, we\u0027ll keep on the lookout for that,\" Adam was saying, sparing Cassie the necessity of speaking. \"We can talk to the old ladies tomorrow - or maybe we should wait until after Cassie\u0027s grandmother\u0027s funeral.\" \"All right,\" Cassie murmured. \"You\u0027re making a lot of suggestions, Adam,\" Faye said, stung into speaking at last. Her arms were still folded over her chest, and her honey-pale skin was flushed with anger. Adam looked back without expression. \"Come to think of it, there was another suggestion I was going to make,\" he said. \"I think we should retake the leadership vote.\" Faye lunged toward him, golden eyes blazing. \"You can\u0027t do that!\" \"Why not? If all of us agree,\" Adam said calmly. \"Because it\u0027s not in the traditions,\" Faye hissed. \"You look at any Book of Shadows and you\u0027ll see! The vote is the vote; I won and it can\u0027t be changed now. I\u0027m the coven leader.\" Adam turned to the others for help, but Melanie was looking troubled and Diana was slowly shaking her head. \"She\u0027s right, Adam,\" Diana said softly. \"The vote was fair, at the time. There aren\u0027t any provisions for changing it.\" Melanie nodded her unwilling agreement. \"And I don\u0027t like you making all these plans without consulting me,\" Faye went on, pacing again like a panther in a cage. Sparks actually seemed to flash from her eyes, the way they flashed from the red gems at her throat and on her fingers as she crossed patches of sunlight. \"Well, what do you want us to do?\" Laurel said challengingly, tossing her long light-brown hair back. \"You were the one who wanted Black John out, Faye. You said he was going to help us, to give us his power. Well, how about it? What do you say now that he\u0027s here?\" Faye was breathing hard. \"He may be testing us - \"By killing Cassie\u0027s grandma?\" Deborah cut in harshly. \"Don\u0027t be stupid, Faye. I was there; I saw it. There\u0027s no excuse for murdering old ladies.\" Faye glared at her defecting ex-lieutenant. \"I don\u0027t know why he did that! Maybe he has some plans that we don\u0027t know about.\" \"That\u0027s the truest thing you\u0027ve ever said,\" Melanie interrupted. \"He does have plans, Faye - to take us over. He\u0027s already killed four people, and if we annoy him I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be happy to kill us, too.\" Faye stopped pacing and smiled triumphantly. \"He can\u0027t,\" she snapped. \"If Cassie is right - and I\u0027m not saying she is, but if she is - then he needs us for his coven. So he can\u0027t kill us!\" \"Well, he can\u0027t kill all of us, anyway,\" Adam said dryly. \"He can only spare one.\" Silence fell. The members of the Circle glanced uneasily at one another. \"Well, then, maybe you\u0027d each better be sure you\u0027re not the one,\" Faye said, smiling around at them. It wasn\u0027t quite her old, lazy smile; it was more a baring of teeth. Before anyone could say anything she turned around and stalked out of the room. They could hear her footsteps going rapidly down the stairs, then the slam of the science building\u0027s front door. Cassie, Adam, and Diana looked at one another. Adam shook his head. \"We\u0027re in trouble,\" he said. \"Oh, so is that what we figured out at this meeting?\" said Deborah. Diana leaned her forehead against her hand wearily. \"We need her,\" she said. \"She is the coven leader, and we need her on our side, not on his. We\u0027d better go talk to her.\" Slowly, the Club members got up. Outside, it was too bright, and Cassie squinted. Seventh period had just ended and people were flooding out of the school exits. Cassie scanned the crowds but couldn\u0027t see Faye. \"She\u0027s probably gone home,\" Diana was saying. \"We\u0027ll have to go after her .. .\" Cassie didn\u0027t hear the rest. Among the milling students in the parking lot she had suddenly glimpsed a familiar face. A strange familiar face, one that didn\u0027t belong here, one that she had to rack her brains to identify. For God\u0027s sake, where had she seen that turned-up nose, that straw-colored hair, those cold hazel eyes before? It was someone she\u0027d known quite well, someone she\u0027d been used to looking at day after day, but that she\u0027d been only too happy to forget about when she came to New Salem. A feeling of heat and humidity overcame Cassie. A memory of sand underfoot, sweat trickling down her sides, suntan lotion greasy on her nose. A sound of lapping waves and a smell of overheated bodies and a sense of oppression. Cape Cod. The familiar girl was Portia.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-3.html","bookId":2097,"book":{"id":2097,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Power (The Secret Circle #3)","description":"Storyline: The Secret Circle book 3: The Power United at last with Diana, the mistress of her coven, Cassie must first sacrifice her love for Adam to save the Secret Circle and the town of New Salem from the evil powers of the witch Faye.
