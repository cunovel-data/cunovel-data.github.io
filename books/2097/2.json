{"id":90559,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"You\u0027ve told the story your way,\" Adam said. \"Some of it\u0027s been close to the truth, and some of it\u0027s been just plain lies. But none of it happened exactly the way you told it.\" He looked around the Circle again. \"I don\u0027t care what you think of me,\" he said, \"but there\u0027s somebody else involved here. And she\" - he glanced at Cassie, just long enough for her to see his blue-gray eyes, still shining like silver - \"doesn\u0027t deserve to be put through this, especially not tonight.\" A few of the coven members, notably Laurel and Melanie, looked away, slightly ashamed. But the rest simply stared, angry and mistrustful. \"So what\u0027s your side of the story?\" Deborah said, scowling. Her expression said she felt she\u0027d been taken in, and she didn\u0027t like it. \"First of all, it wasn\u0027t like that when Cassie and I met. It wasn\u0027t love at first sight . . .\" Adam faltered for a moment, looking into the distance. He shook his head. \"It wasn\u0027t love. She helped me, she saved me from four outsider guys with a gun. The witch-hunting kind of outsiders.\" He looked hard at Chris and Doug Henderson. \"But she didn\u0027t know - \" Deborah began. \"She didn\u0027t know what I was, then. She didn\u0027t know what she was. Witches were something out of fairy tales to her. Cassie helped me just because I needed help. These guys were after me, and she stashed me in a boat and sent them all off running in the wrong direction down the beach. They tried to get her to tell where I was, they even hurt her, but she didn\u0027t give me up.\" There was a silence. Deborah, who admired physical bravery above all other qualities, looked quizzical, her scowl smoothing out a little. Faye, though, was squirming like a fish trying to get off a hook, and her expression was unpleasant. \"How sweet. The brave heroine. So you just couldn\u0027t resist fooling around with her.\" \"Don\u0027t be a jerk, Faye,\" Adam said, giving Faye\u0027s arm a little shake. \"I didn\u0027t do anything with her. We just - \" He shook his head again. \"I told her \u0027thank you.\u0027 I wanted her to know that I wouldn\u0027t forget what she\u0027d done - remember, at the time I still thought she was an outsider, and I\u0027d never known an outsider who did anything like that for one of us. She was just this nice outsider girl; sort of quiet and pretty, and I wanted to say \u0027thanks.\u0027 But when I was looking at her I suddenly felt - as if we were connected somehow. It sounds stupid now, maybe, but I could almost see this connection...\" \"The silver cord,\" Cassie whispered. Her eyes were full, and she wasn\u0027t aware she\u0027d spoken aloud until she saw faces swing toward her. Melanie\u0027s eyebrows went up and Diana looked startled too, maybe just at hearing Cassie break the silence she\u0027d kept so long. Suzan\u0027s rosebud lips were pursed into an O. \"Yeah, I guess that was what it looked like,\" Adam was saying, staring off into the distance again. \"I don\u0027t know - it was just this confused impression. But I did feel grateful to her, and I would have liked her for a friend - how about that, an outsider friend?\" There were murmurs of amusement and unbelief. \"And,\" Adam said, looking straight at Diana, \"that\u0027s why I gave her the chalcedony rose you gave me.\" No murmurs this time. Grim silence. \"It was a token of friendship, a way to repay a debt,\" Adam said. \"I figured if she ever got in trouble, I could sense it through the crystal and maybe do something to help. So I gave it to her - and that was all I did.\" He looked at Faye defiantly, and then even more defiantly around the group. \"Except - yeah, right - I did kiss her. I kissed her hand.\" Laurel blinked. The Henderson brothers looked at Adam sideways, as if to say he was crazy but they guessed it was his own business what bits of girls he kissed. Faye tried to look scornful, but it didn\u0027t come off very well. \"Then I left the Cape,\" Adam said. \"I didn\u0027t see Cassie again until I came back up here for Kori\u0027s initiation - which turned out to be Cassie\u0027s initiation. But there\u0027s one other important thing. In all the time I talked to Cassie I never told her who I was or where I was from. I never told her my name. So whatever she came up here and did - whatever poems she wrote, Faye - she didn\u0027t know who I was. She didn\u0027t know Diana and I were together. Not until that night when I showed up on the beach.\" \"So I suppose that\u0027s a good reason for pretending you didn\u0027t know each other, for sneaking around behind everybody\u0027s back and meeting each other,\" Faye said, on the offensive again. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" Adam said tightly, looking as if he\u0027d like to shake Faye again. \"We didn\u0027t sneak anywhere. The first time we ever talked alone was the night the skull ceremony in Diana\u0027s garage went wrong. Yeah, that night on the bluff when your little spies saw us, Faye. But d\u0027you know what Cassie said to me in our first conversation alone since we\u0027d met? She said she was in love with me - and that she knew it was wrong. Ever since she\u0027d found out it was wrong, ever since she realized that I wasn\u0027t just some guy on the beach, but Diana\u0027s boyfriend, she\u0027d been fighting against it. She\u0027d even taken an oath - a blood oath - not to ever show anybody, by word or look or deed, how she felt about me. She didn\u0027t want Diana to find out and feel bad, or feel sorry for her. Does that sound like somebody who\u0027s trying to sneak around?\" The Circle looked back at him. Soberly, Melanie said, \"Let me get this right. You\u0027re saying there\u0027s nothing at all to Faye\u0027s accusations?\" Adam swallowed. \"No,\" he said quietly. \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m saying. That night on the bluff . . .\" He stopped and swallowed again, and then his voice hardened. \"1 can\u0027t explain what happened, except that it was my fault, not Cassie\u0027s. She did everything she could to avoid me, to keep out of my way. But once we were alone we were drawn together.\" He looked at Diana without flinching, although the pain was evident in his face. \"I\u0027m not proud of myself, but I never meant to hurt you. And Cassie is completely innocent. The only reason she was speaking to me at all that night was that she wanted to give me back the chalcedony rose - so I could give it back to you. In all of this, she\u0027s never been anything but honest and honorable. No matter what it cost her.\" He stopped and his mouth turned grim. \"If I\u0027d known she was being blackmailed by this snake - \" \"I beg your pardon,\" Faye interrupted, golden eyes flashing dangerously. Adam returned the look, just as dangerous. \"That\u0027s what it was, wasn\u0027t it, Faye? Blackmail. Your little spies saw us that night - when we were saying good-bye, and swearing never to see each other alone again, and you decided to make the most of it. I knew there was something going on with you and Cassie after that, but I could never figure out what it was. Cassie was scared to death all of a sudden, but why she didn\u0027t just come to me and tell me what you were up to . . .\" His voice trailed off and he looked toward Cassie. Cassie shook her head mutely. How could she explain? \"I didn\u0027t want you caught up in it too,\" she said in a voice scarcely above a whisper. \"I was afraid you\u0027d tell Diana, and Faye said if Diana found out...\" \"What?\" Adam said. When Cassie shook her head again he gave Faye\u0027s arm a little shake. \"What, Faye? If Diana found out it would kill her? Wreck the coven? Is that what you told Cassie?\" Faye smirked. \"If I did, it was only the truth, wasn\u0027t it? As things turned out.\" She wrenched away from Adam. \"So you used her love for Diana against her. You blackmailed her to make her help you find the skull, right? I\u0027ll bet it took some persuading.\" Adam was only guessing, but his guess was dead on target. Cassie found herself nodding. \"I found out where it was - \" \"But how?\" Diana interrupted, blurting it, speaking for the first time directly to Cassie. Cassie looked into the clear green eyes with the tears hanging on the dark lashes and spoke directly back. \"I did what Faye said,\" she said tremulously. \"First I looked in the walnut cabinet - remember when I stayed overnight and you woke up with me in the room? When the skull wasn\u0027t there I thought I\u0027d have to give up, but then I had a dream. It made me remember something I\u0027d seen in your Book of Shadows, about purifying an evil object by burying it in sand. So I went and searched the beach and finally found the skull under that ring of stones.\" Cassie paused, looking at Faye, her voice growing stronger. \"Once I had my hands on it, though, I realized I couldn\u0027t give it to Faye. I just couldn\u0027t. But she had followed me and she took it anyway.\" Cassie took a deep breath, making herself meet Diana\u0027s eyes again, her own eyes begging Diana to understand. \"I know I shouldn\u0027t have let her have it. I should have stood up to her, then and afterward, but I was weak and stupid. I\u0027m sorry now - I wish I\u0027d just come and told you in the beginning, but I was so afraid you\u0027d be hurt...\" Tears were choking her voice now, and making her vision blur. \"And as for what Adam said - about it all being his fault - you have to know that isn\u0027t true. It was my fault, and at the Halloween dance I tried to make him kiss me, because I was so upset by then and I thought that nothing really mattered, since I was evil anyway.\" There was wetness on Diana\u0027s cheeks, but now she looked taken aback. \"Since what?\u0027 \"Since I was evil,\" Cassie said, hearing the terrible, stark truth in the simple words. \"Since I was responsible for killing Jeffrey Lovejoy.\" The entire coven stared at her, appalled. \"Wait a minute,\" Melanie said. \"Run that by me one more time.\" \"Whenever anybody used the skull, it released dark energy, which went out and killed somebody,\" Cassie said carefully and clearly. \"Faye and I were the ones who used the skull before Jeffrey was killed. If it wasn\u0027t for me, she couldn\u0027t have used it, and Jeffrey would still be alive. So, you see, I\u0027m responsible.\" Animation was returning to Diana\u0027s eyes. \"But you didn\u0027t know,\" she said. Cassie shook her head fiercely. \"That\u0027s no excuse. There\u0027s no excuse for any of it - not even for doing worse things because I thought I was evil anyway and what did it matter? It did matter. I listened to Faye and I let her bully me.\" And I kept the hematite, she thought, but there was no point in getting into that. She shrugged, blinking more tears away. \"I even let her make me vote for her for leader. I\u0027m sorry, Diana - I\u0027m so sorry. I don\u0027t know why I did it.\" \"I do,\" Diana said shakily. \"Adam said it already - you were scared.\" Cassie nodded. All the words she\u0027d held back for so long were pouring out. \"Once I started doing things for her, I couldn\u0027t stop. She had more and more to blackmail me with. Everything just went more and more wrong and I didn\u0027t know how to get out of it . . .\" Cassie\u0027s voice broke. She saw Faye, lip curled, step forward and try to say something, and she saw Adam shut her up with a single glance. Then she turned and saw Diana\u0027s eyes. They were as luminous as peridot crystals held up to the light, liquid with unshed tears, but also with - something else. It was a look Cassie had never expected to see again, especially not directed at her. A look of pain, yes, but also of forgiveness and longing. A look of love. Something broke inside Cassie, something hard and tight that had been growing since she had started to deceive Diana. She took a stumbling step forward. Then she and Diana were in each others\u0027 arms, both crying, both holding on with all their strength. \"I\u0027m so sorry, I\u0027m so sorry for everything,\" Cassie sobbed. It seemed a long time before Diana drew back, and when she did she stepped away from the group, turning to look into the darkness. Cassie wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand. The moon, hanging low on the horizon, shone like old gold on Diana\u0027s hair. There was absolute silence except for the distant roar and crash of waves on the beach. The entire group stood motionless, as if waiting for something that none of them could quite define. At last Diana turned back to them. \"I think we\u0027ve all heard enough,\" she said. \"I think I understand, maybe not everything, but most of it. Listen, everybody, because I don\u0027t want to say this again.\" Everyone was quiet, their faces turned toward Diana expectantly. Cassie had the distinct feeling that a judgement was about to be rendered. Diana looked like a priestess or a princess, tall and pale, but resolute. There was a strange dignity about her, an aura of greatness and of certainty that belied the pain in her eyes. I\u0027m waiting to hear my punishment, Cassie thought. Whatever it was, she deserved it. She glanced at Adam and saw he was waiting too. His expression asked no favors, but Cassie knew what he must be feeling underneath it. They both stood before Diana, connected by their crime, glad to have it in the open at last. \"1 don\u0027t want anybody to discuss what\u0027s happened tonight again,\" Diana said, her voice soft and distinct. \"Not ever. Once I\u0027ve finished talking we\u0027ll all consider the subject closed.\" She looked at Adam, not quite meeting his eyes. \"I think,\" she said slowly, \"that I know how it must have been for you. These things happen sometimes. I forgive you. And as for you, Cassie - you\u0027re even less to blame. There was no way for you to have known. I don\u0027t blame either of you. All I ask - \" Cassie drew a shuddering breath and broke in. She couldn\u0027t hold back any longer. \"Diana,\" she said, \"I want you to know something. All this time, underneath, I\u0027ve been angry and jealous because Adam belonged to you and not me. Even up until tonight. But all that\u0027s changed now - truly. Now all I want is for you and Adam to be happy. Nothing is more important to me than you - and the promise I made.\" For an instant it crossed Cassie\u0027s mind to wonder if Adam were less important, but she shoved the thought away and spoke earnestly, with utter conviction. \"Adam and I - we both made that promise. If you\u0027ll just give us another chance to keep it - just one more chance ...\" Diana was opening her mouth, but Cassie went on before she could speak. \"Please, Diana. You\u0027ve got to know that you can trust me - that you can trust us. You\u0027ve got to let us prove that.\" There was a slight pause, then Diana said, \"Yes. Yes - you\u0027re right.\" She took a deep breath and let it out, looking at Adam almost tentatively. \"Well, then, what if - if we just forget all about this for a while? Just - wipe the slate clean?\" A muscle in Adam\u0027s jaw jerked. Silently, he took the hand Diana extended toward him. Diana held her other hand out to Cassie. Cassie took it and held on tightly to the slim, cold fingers. She wanted to laugh and cry at once. Instead she just gave Diana a wobbly smile. Looking at Adam she saw that he was trying to smile too, although his eyes were dark as storm clouds over the ocean. \"And that\u0027s it?\" Faye exploded. \"Everything\u0027s all right now, all sweetness and light? Everybody loves everybody and you\u0027re all going home holding hands?\" \"Yes,\" Adam snapped, giving her a hard look. \"As for the last, anyway. We\u0027re going home - it\u0027s past time for that.\" \"Cassie needs to rest,\" Diana agreed. The blank helplessness had left her entirely, and although she looked more fragile than Cassie had ever seen her before, she also looked determined. \"We all need that.\" \"And we need to call a doctor - or somebody,\" Deborah said unexpectedly. She inclined her head toward Number Twelve. \"Cassie\u0027s grandma . . .\" \"Whose side are you on?\" Faye snarled. Deborah just gave her a cool look. Diana\u0027s fingers tightened on Cassie\u0027s. \"Yes. You\u0027re right, we\u0027ll call Dr. Stern - and Cassie can come home with me.\" Faye gave a short bark of laughter, but nobody laughed with her. Even the Henderson brothers were serious, their slanted eyes thoughtful. Suzan twisted a lock of strawberry-blond hair around her fingers, looking at Cassie\u0027s and Diana\u0027s intertwined hands. Laurel nodded encouragingly when Cassie glanced at her, and Melanie\u0027s cool gray eyes shone with quiet approval. Sean chewed his lip, looking uncertainly from one member of the group to another. But it was Nick\u0027s expression that surprised Cassie most. His face, usually so unemotional, was clearly strained, as if there were some violent struggle going on beneath the surface. There was no time to think about him now, though. No time even to think about Faye, who was seething uselessly, her plans to fracture the coven in ruins. Melanie was speaking. \"Do you want to go by my house first, Cassie? Great-aunt Constance is looking after your mom, and if you want to see her ...\" Cassie nodded eagerly. It seemed like a hundred years since she had seen her mother, since she had been inside that room filled with red light, looking at her mother\u0027s glassy, empty eyes. Surely her mother would be all right by now; surely she would be able to tell Cassie what had happened. But when the three of them, Melanie, Cassie, and Diana, who hadn\u0027t let go of Cassie\u0027s hand on the short drive to Number Four, went into the house, Cassie\u0027s heart sank. Melanie\u0027s great-aunt, a thin-lipped woman with severe eyes, led them silently into a downstairs guest room. One look at the ghostly figure on the bed sent chills of dismay through Cassie\u0027s bloodstream. \"Mom?\" she whispered, knowing already there would be no answer. God, her mother looked young. Even younger than she normally did, frighteningly young, unnaturally so. It was as if it weren\u0027t Cassie\u0027s mother on the bed there at all, but some little girl with dark hair and big haunted black eyes that vaguely resembled Mrs. Blake\u0027s. A stranger. Not someone who was going to be of help to Cassie. \"It\u0027s okay, Mom,\" Cassie whispered, stepping away from Diana to put a hand on her mother\u0027s shoulder. \"Everything\u0027s going to be all right. You\u0027ll see. You\u0027re going to be just fine.\" Her throat ached, and then she felt Diana gently leading her away. \"You\u0027ve both been through enough,\" Melanie said once they were outside again. \"Let us take care of things with the doctor - and the police, if they have to come. You and Cassie get some sleep.\" The rest of the coven was waiting in the street, and they nodded in agreement when Melanie said this. Cassie looked at Diana, who nodded too. \"Okay,\" Cassie said. It came out faint and slightly hoarse and she realized how tired she was - bone-tired. At the same time she was light-headed, and the entire scene in front of her was assuming a dreamlike quality. It was just too strange to be standing out here in the wee hours of the morning, knowing that her grandmother was dead and her mother was in shock, and that she didn\u0027t have a house to go back to. Yet there were no adults on the street, no commotion, only the members of the Circle and an eerie stillness. Come to think of it, why weren\u0027t there any parents out here? Surely some of them must have heard what was going on. But the houses on Crowhaven Road remained shuttered and silent. On the way to Melanie\u0027s house, Cassie thought she\u0027d seen a light go off in Suzan\u0027s house and a curtain whisk back at the Henderson\u0027s. If any adults were awake, they weren\u0027t getting involved. We\u0027re on our own, Cassie thought. But Diana was beside her, and she could see Adam\u0027s tall form silhouetted against the headlights of the coven\u0027s parked cars. A sort of strength flowed into Cassie just at their nearness. \"We\u0027ve got to talk tomorrow,\" she said. \"There\u0027s a lot I\u0027ve got to tell you - all of you. Things my grandmother told me right before . . . before she died.\" \"We can meet at lunchtime on the beach - \" Diana began, but Faye\u0027s throaty voice cut her off. \"No, we can\u0027t. I\u0027m the one who decides where the meetings are now, or had you forgotten?\" Faye\u0027s head was thrown back proudly, the silver crescent-moon diadem gleaming against the midnight-black of her hair. Diana opened her mouth, then shut it again. \"All right,\" Adam said with deceptive calmness, stepping out of the glare of headlights to stand by Faye. \"You\u0027re the leader. So lead. Where do we meet?\" Faye\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"At the old science building. But - \" \"Fine.\" Adam didn\u0027t wait for her to finish; he turned his back on her. \"I\u0027ll drive you home,\" he said to Diana and Cassie. Faye looked furious, but the three of them were already moving away. \"By the way, Diana - happy birthday,\" she called spitefully after them. Diana didn\u0027t answer.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-2.html","bookId":2097,"book":{"id":2097,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Power (The Secret Circle #3)","description":"Storyline: The Secret Circle book 3: The Power United at last with Diana, the mistress of her coven, Cassie must first sacrifice her love for Adam to save the Secret Circle and the town of New Salem from the evil powers of the witch Faye.
