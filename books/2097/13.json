There\u0027s an eclipse.\"\\n\\n \"A total lunar eclipse,\" said Melanie.\\n\\n \"Is that bad for us?\" Cassie asked.\\n\\n Diana considered. \"Well, all witches\u0027 powers are strongest in moonlight. And certain spells are best done at the dark of the moon, or at the full moon, or at some other phase. I\u0027m sure that if Black John is going to move on that particular night, an eclipse must be best for whatever he\u0027s going to do. And worst for us fighting him.\"\\n\\n \"Except,\" Adam said, \"if we know he\u0027s\" going to move - and he doesn\u0027t know we know it. He won\u0027t realize we\u0027re prepared.\"\\n\\n There were thoughtful nods around the Circle. It was the day after Thanksgiving and everyone who had come to rescue Cassie the day before was gathered at Adam\u0027s house. Cassie had told them what had happened in the clearing before they came - except about Jordan asking for the Master Tools. This she\u0027d whispered to Adam and Diana in front of Diana\u0027s house last night. Now she looked at the two of them with a question in her eyes.\\n\\n Adam and Diana both regarded the group unhappily. \"Right,\" Adam said. \"I guess we\u0027d better tell them. Since he knows, it doesn\u0027t really matter, does it?\"\\n\\n \"Faye must have found out somehow,\" Diana said, looking more unhappy than ever. \"She went to Black John - \"\\n\\n \"No,\" Cassie said.\\n\\n Diana looked at her, surprised. \"But - \"\\n\\n \"Not Faye,\" Cassie said, grimly and with absolute certainty. \"Sean.\"\\n\\n Adam cursed softly. Diana stared at him, then at Cassie. Then she whispered, \"Oh, my God.\"\\n\\n \"What about Sean? What did he do?\" Deborah demanded. Nick was very alert, his narrow eyes fixed on Cassie.\\n\\n After a glance at Diana - who nodded and leaned her head on one hand - Cassie said simply to Deborah, \"He told Black John that Adam and Diana and I had found the Master Tools.\"\\n\\n \"You found - you mean you guys - you mean you really - ?\" Deborah was sputtering. The others looked speechless with amazement.\\n\\n \"Cassie led us to them,\" Adam said. \"They were in the fireplace at Number Twelve. On the way back we ran into Sean, who said he\u0027d seen a light. But you think ... ?\" He looked at Cassie.\\n\\n Cassie took a deep breath. \"I think Black John has been influencing him all along. I think he was the one who stole the hematite from my room. I figured it out last night, when I was trying to get to sleep. I started thinking about who could have told Black John - and I kept getting this flash of Sean the first time I saw him. He was wearing a belt with his name carved on some shiny stone. I used to see him wear it all the time, but now that it\u0027s cold and everybody\u0027s wearing sweaters, I haven\u0027t noticed it. But I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s been wearing it underneath, and I\u0027ll bet he was wearing it that night he came out in his pajama top. And I\u0027ll bet that shiny stone is - \"\\n\\n \"Hematite,\" half a dozen bleak voices chorused, and everyone looked at Melanie.\\n\\n \"Hematite or lodestone,\" Melanie confirmed. \"Yes, it is; I\u0027ve seen that belt too. How incredibly stupid of us. It never even occurred to me.\"\\n\\n Nick leaned forward. \"So you think Faye wasn\u0027t the one who told Black John we were wearing amethysts as protection? You think Sean did that?\"\\n\\n Cassie looked at the hard line of his mouth. \"It wasn\u0027t his fault, Nick. If Black John got into his mind - well, I know how I felt when he was trying to get into my mind. Sean wouldn\u0027t have been able to resist. In fact, we saw that he couldn\u0027t resist, at the assembly when he volunteered to be a hall monitor. I had to yell at him to break the trance.\"\\n\\n \"Sean . . . God!\" Laurel said, settling back. \"It\u0027s just too awful.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s worse,\" Cassie said. She stared down at Mrs. Franklin\u0027s coffee table, pressing one hand flat against it. She didn\u0027t know how to say this next. \"You guys, I think ... I think Black John used Sean to commit the murders.\"\\n\\n There was a deafening silence. Even Diana looked too horrified to support Cassie. But Adam looked into her eyes and then slowly, shutting his own eyes, nodded.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" said Suzan.\\n\\n \"I think\" - Cassie swallowed - \"that he could have written a note to Kori the night before, asking her to meet him in front of school. She wouldn\u0027t have suspected him; she\u0027d have just thought it was Circle business. He could have come up behind her, and - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll kill him!\" Doug shouted, jumping up. Nick and Deborah grabbed him, but by then Chris was shouting too, lunging for the door. Adam and Melanie wrestled him to the ground.\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t him; it wasn\u0027t Sean,\" Cassie shouted. \"Listen to me, you guys! It was Black John; he\u0027s the one who killed Kori. If I\u0027m right, Sean probably doesn\u0027t even remember it! He was just a - a container for the dark energy to use.\"\\n\\n \"God,\" Laurel said. \"God - remember the skull ceremony in Diana\u0027s garage? The time the second bunch of dark energy was released? Sean and Faye started fighting, the candle went out, and the dark energy escaped. Sean said Faye started it, and we all believed him. But Faye said Sean was trying to break the circle. What if she was right?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet she was right,\" Cassie said. \"Black John\u0027s been with us all the time. Whatever Sean saw, he saw. And when enough dark energy was released from the skull - which Black John arranged to happen whenever he could - then it worked with Sean to commit the murders.\"\\n\\n \"It would have been easy to get Mr. Fogle over to Devil\u0027s Cove, too,\" Suzan said. \"Sean could have pretended he had something bad to tell about somebody else in the Club. I used to do that all the time; tell the principal things about - \" She glanced at Diana. \"Well - that was in the old days. Anyway, Sean could have asked Fogle to meet him under the rocks and then - foom.\" She made a pushing gesture. \"Good-bye, Mr. Fogle.\"\\n\\n \"Can we let you up now?\" Adam asked Chris, and \"Can we trust you to act sensible?\" Deborah asked Doug.\\n\\n There were incoherent snarls from the Henderson brothers, and when they were released they sat up with flushed faces and blue-green eyes as bright as gas flames.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re gonna get that bastard,\" Doug said quietly.\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s the last thing we do,\" said Chris, equally quiet. Cassie hoped they meant Black John.\\n\\n \"But what about Jeffrey?\" Diana asked Cassie.\\n\\n Cassie shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know how Sean could have gotten him down to the boiler room - \"\\n\\n \"By saying you were down there, maybe,\" Laurel said.\\n\\n \" - but if he did, he could have just come up behind him and strangled him with the rope - no, Sean\u0027s too short. Oh, I don\u0027t know how he could have done it - \"\\n\\n \"By getting Lovejoy to sit down or lean over,\" Nick said, his voice crisp and low. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027d have done, anyway, if I were trying to strangle somebody that much taller. And look, if Sean had that dark energy inside him somehow, he could have had outrageous strength. He must have had, to be able to put the noose around Lovejoy\u0027s neck and haul him up over that pipe afterward.\"\\n\\n Cassie felt sick. \"It\u0027s true - I didn\u0027t see either Sean or Jeffrey at the dance for a while before the murder. Then all of a sudden Sean appeared on the dance floor, coming toward me. So I ran to the boiler room ... and found Jeffrey.\"\\n\\n \"I think we need to talk to Sean,\" said Diana.\\n\\n \"No,\" Adam said, with surprising vehemence. \"That\u0027s just what we shouldn\u0027t do. If we talk to him now, Black John will realize we know. But if we don\u0027t say anything, if we play along with Sean and pretend we don\u0027t know, we can feed him disinformation. Tell him things that aren\u0027t true, for him to pass along to Black John.\"\\n\\n \"Like tell him we don\u0027t know when Black John is going to move,\" Deborah said, her dark eyes beginning to snap. \"Tell him we\u0027re terrified of Black John - we don\u0027t know how to use the Master Tools - we\u0027re unprepared . . .\"\\n\\n \"Or that we\u0027re all fighting among ourselves,\" suggested Laurel. \"We can\u0027t agree on anything. We\u0027re deadlocked.\"\\n\\n \"Right! And then that night we\u0027ll actually be ready for him. When\u0027s the eclipse, Melanie?\" Adam said.\\n\\n \"Around six forty in the evening. That\u0027s what I\u0027d say we have to look out for. The moon in shadow.\"\\n\\n \"The moon in shadow,\" Cassie repeated softly. \"I think I can understand why he would choose that time.\" He\u0027s a shadow himself, she thought.\\n\\n \"And until then all we have to do is pretend to be completely disorganized, terrified, and argumentative,\" said Melanie.\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t be too hard,\" Suzan said, raising an eyebrow.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s somebody I think we should talk to,\" Cassie said, \"without giving away any of our secrets. I think one of us should talk to Faye.\"\\n\\n \"And I think you\u0027re elected,\" Nick said. \"I can\u0027t think of anybody better for the job.\" He winked at Cassie, but it was a grim wink.\\n\\n \"We need you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure,\" Faye said lazily, examining herself in the mirror. She was trying her hair in different ways: twisted back, on top of her head, at the nape of her neck. Cassie hadn\u0027t been in Faye\u0027s bedroom since the night Faye had set a ring of red stones around the crystal skull and released the dark energy that had eventually killed Jeffrey. The room was as opulent and luxurious as ever: the wallpaper patterned with lush jungle orchids, the bed piled with cushions, the stereo system packed with expensive extras. Faye\u0027s vampire kittens once again twined sinuously around Cassie\u0027s ankles.\\n\\n But there was a different atmosphere here than before. The red candles were gone from the dresser tops; in their place were stacks of paperwork. On the bedspread along with the cordless phone was a beeper. An appointment book was sitting in front of the mirror, and the clothes strewn carelessly about were of the sultry office-girl kind Faye had taken to wearing.\\n\\n The room felt - pressured. Type-A lifestyle. More like Portia than Faye.\\n\\n \"I suppose you know that Portia Bainbridge and Sally had me kidnapped two days ago,\" Cassie said.\\n\\n Faye shot her an amused glance in the mirror. \"And I\u0027m sure you know you only had to open your pretty little mouth and yell, and Daddy would have been right there to help.\"\\n\\n Cassie tried not to look as sick as that made her feel. \"I don\u0027t want his help,\" she said, swallowing.\\n\\n Faye shrugged. \"Maybe later.\"\\n\\n \"No, Faye. Not later. I don\u0027t ever want to see him again. But if you know about me being kidnapped, you must know what they were after. We\u0027ve found the Master Tools.\" Cassie looked at the strange opposite-Faye image in the mirror, and then turned to look the real Faye in the eyes. \"They belong to you,\" she said distinctly. \"You\u0027re leader of the coven. But the coven is going to fight... Black John.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t even say it, can you? It\u0027s not so hard. Daddy. Father. Pops. Whatever you want to call him, I\u0027m sure he won\u0027t mind - \"\\n\\n \"Will you listen to me, Faye!\" Cassie almost shouted. \"You\u0027re sitting here being fatuous - \"\\n\\n \"And she knows big words, too!\"\\n\\n \" - while something serious is going on! Something deadly serious. He is going to kill people. That\u0027s all he is, Faye, hatred and the desire to kill. I know it; I can feel it in him. And he\u0027s taking you for a ride.\"\\n\\n Faye\u0027s golden eyes narrowed. She looked less amused.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve known you for a while now, Faye, and there\u0027ve been plenty of times when I\u0027ve hated you. But I never thought I\u0027d see you become somebody\u0027s stenographer. You used to make up your own mind about things and you didn\u0027t kiss up to anybody. Do you remember how you once asked me if I wanted my epitaph to be \u0027Here lies Cassie. She was . . . nice\u0027? Well, do you want yours to be \u0027Here lies Faye. She was a good secretary\u0027?\"\\n\\n One of Faye\u0027s hands, with its long fingernails - mauve these days, instead of scarlet - was clenched on the dresser. Her jaw was set, and she was staring hard into her own golden eyes in the mirror.\\n\\n Cassie\u0027s pulse quickened. \"When I looked at you I used to see a lion - a sort of black and gold lion. Now I see\" - she glanced down at her feet - \"a kitten. Some rich guy\u0027s kitten.\"\\n\\n She waited tensely. Maybe ... just maybe . . . Maybe the bond forged during the candle ceremony would be strong enough, maybe Faye had enough pride, enough independence . . .\\n\\n Faye\u0027s eyes met hers in the mirror. Then Faye shook her head. Her face was closed, her mouth tight.\\n\\n \"I think you know the way out,\" she said.\\n\\n The kittens tangled around Cassie\u0027s feet as she turned, and she felt the razor-sharp nick of claws.\\n\\n No, she told them with her mind, and she felt the kittens freeze, ears back. She picked them up, one in each hand, and tossed them onto Faye\u0027s bed.\\n\\n Then she left.\\n\\n \"We have to give her until the ninth,\" Diana said. \"Maybe she\u0027ll change her mind.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Maybe later,\u0027\" Cassie quoted, but there wasn\u0027t much hope in her voice.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll wait until the ninth for Sean, too,\" Adam said.\\n\\n They made it through the next seven school days without trouble - except among themselves.\\n\\n At New Salem High, the members of the Club only spoke to each other in public to argue. Laurel\u0027s birthday on the first and Sean\u0027s birthday on the third of December went uncelebrated, because, according to a distraught Diana, none of them could get along long enough to plan a party. Cassie saw the looks and heard the whispers and knew that the plan was working. She concentrated on being as much like the old Cassie as possible - shy, tongue-tied, easily frightened or embarrassed. The role was uncomfortable, like some old skin she\u0027d out-grown, and she itched to get rid of it. But for the time they were fooling Sean. They were even fooling Faye.\\n\\n \"I hear you and Nick have broken up,\" Faye said in the hall one day. The hooded golden eyes were warm and pleased.\\n\\n Cassie flushed, looking away.\\n\\n \"And the Club isn\u0027t much of a club without me, from what I see these days,\" Faye went on, practically purring.\\n\\n Cassie squirmed.\\n\\n \"I may join you sometime - maybe for the next full-moon celebration. If you\u0027re having one, that is.\"\\n\\n Cassie shrugged.\\n\\n Faye looked smug. \"We could have a wicked time,\" she said. \"Think about it.\"\\n\\n As Faye walked away Cassie saw Sally Walt-man at her post as hall monitor. She edged up as inconspicuously as possible.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re ready for the ninth, like you told us,\" Cassie said softly. \"But can you do one more thing for us?\"\\n\\n Sally looked uneasy. \"He\u0027s got everybody watching everybody. Nobody\u0027s safe - \"\\n\\n \"I know, but when the ninth comes, will you tell us if he does anything unusual? If it looks like he\u0027s moving? Please, Sally. Everything I told you about him is true.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Sally said, casting a hunted glance around. \"Now just go, will you? I\u0027ll try to get a message to you if I hear anything.\"\\n\\n Cassie nodded and hurried away.\\n\\n The ninth dawned gray and windy, the sort of day that normally made Cassie want to curl up in front of a fire. Instead, she put on extra-warm clothes: a thick sweater, gloves, a parka. She had no idea what they might be facing today, but she wanted to be dressed for action. In her backpack, along with her school notebooks, she put her Book of Shadows.\\n\\n She was walking out of French class when Sally intercepted her.\\n\\n \"Come with me, please,\" the rusty-haired girl said in crisp hall-monitor accents, and Cassie followed her into the empty nurse\u0027s office next door. Sally immediately dropped the officious tone.\\n\\n \"If I get caught with you, it\u0027s all over,\" she said rapidly in a harsh whisper, her eyes on the frosted-glass window in the door. \"But here it is: I just overheard Brunswick talking with your friend Faye. Maybe you\u0027ll understand what it was about, because I sure don\u0027t. They were discussing something about arranging an accident on the bridge - it sounded like they were taking an empty school bus over there, and a car, or maybe it was a couple of cars. He said They only have to burn for an hour or so; by then the water will have risen far enough.\u0027 Does that mean anything to you?\"\\n\\n \"An accident would block the bridge to the mainland,\" Cassie said slowly.\\n\\n \"Sure, but why?\" Sally asked impatiently.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m going to find out. Sally, if I need to see you again, will you be in the cafeteria at lunch?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but you can\u0027t talk to me there. Portia\u0027s been looking at me strangely ever since that night in the clearing - I think she\u0027s suspicious. Her brothers went away mad, and she didn\u0027t believe a word you said about Brunswick. If she catches me with you, I\u0027m dead.\"\\n\\n \"You may be dead if I don\u0027t talk with you,\" Cassie said. \"Go on, get out of here, I\u0027ll leave in a minute.\"\\n\\n Cassie reached the old science building at a run. Waiting on the second floor was the rest of the Club - minus Faye and Sean, who hadn\u0027t been informed of the meeting. The plan had been to nab Sean right after lunch, even if they hadn\u0027t learned anything about Black John\u0027s plans by then.\\n\\n \"But we do know something,\" Cassie said breathlessly, sitting down on a crate. \"Listen.\" She told them what Sally had said.\\n\\n \"Well, that explains it,\" Deborah put in when Cassie finished. \"I just saw him and Faye walk out of the building, and the secretary said they\u0027d be gone all afternoon. So they\u0027re going out to wreck a school bus. Cool.\"\\n\\n \"But why?\" Cassie said. \"I mean, it looks like he wants to block the bridge, but what\u0027s the point?\"\\n\\n It was Adam who answered. He\u0027d been sitting by Doug, with one of the earphones from Doug\u0027s Walkman pressed to his ear.\\n\\n \"The point,\" he said, \"is to keep everybody on the island. There\u0027s just been an update on the news - anybody remember that hurricane they were talking about the last couple days? The one that they were afraid was going to hit Florida, but then it turned north while it was still out in the Atlantic?\"\\n\\n There was head-shaking around the group - most of them hadn\u0027t been too interested in the news lately - but Melanie said, \"I thought they downgraded that to a tropical storm.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, they figured it was just going to dissipate out in the ocean. Look, I know a little about hurricanes. This one isn\u0027t supposed to be a threat, because they\u0027re assuming it\u0027s going to turn northeast at Cape Hatteras. That\u0027s what hurricanes usually do when they hit the low-pressure trough around there. But we all know what happens when they don\u0027t.\" He looked around the group grimly, and this time there were nods from everyone but Cassie.\\n\\n \"When they don\u0027t turn at Cape Hatteras, they come barreling straight up here,\" Adam said to her, then. \"Like the one in 1938, and the one a few years ago ... and the one in 1976.\"\\n\\n The silence was absolute. Cassie glanced from side to side at the faces in the dim room.\\n\\n \"God,\" she whispered, feeling dizzy.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Adam. \"Winds a hundred and fifty miles an hour, and walls of water, forty feet high. Now, they\u0027re still saying this storm is going to turn - they just mentioned on the radio that it\u0027s supposed to stay well off the Atlantic seaboard. But\" - he looked around again, deliberately - \"anybody want to take bets?\"\\n\\n Laurel jumped up. \"We\u0027ve got to stop Black John. If that bridge is blocked, everybody on the island is in danger.\"\\n\\n \"Too late,\" Deborah said briefly. \"He\u0027s already gone. Remember? I saw him leave ten minutes ago.\"\\n\\n \"And everybody\u0027s not just in danger, everybody\u0027s dead,\" Melanie said. \"That storm a couple years ago just nicked New Salem, but this one could wipe us out.\"\\n\\n Cassie looked at Adam. \"How fast is it coming?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Could be fifty miles an hour, could be seventy. If it doesn\u0027t turn at Cape Hatteras, they\u0027ll issue a hurricane warning - but it\u0027ll be too late by then, especially if the bridge is blocked. It could get to us in maybe seven, eight hours. More or less.\"\\n\\n \"Around the time of the eclipse?\" Cassie asked.\\n\\n \"Maybe. Maybe a little later.\"\\n\\n \"But before it hits us, it\u0027ll hit Cape Cod and Boston,\" Diana whispered. \"It will kill people there.\" She looked stunned and dazed at the idea.\\n\\n \"Then there\u0027s only one thing to do,\" Cassie said. \"We\u0027ve got to stop it before it hits land at all. We\u0027ve got to make it dissipate, or turn back out to the ocean, or whatever. Or we\u0027ve got to make him do it. And before that we\u0027ve got to warn people on our own - tell them to do whatever you do in a hurricane - \"\\n\\n \"Evacuate,\" Adam said dryly, \"which may not be possible, even in boats. Listen to that wind.\" He paused and Cassie heard not only the wind but a pattering on the boarded-up windows. Rain.\\n\\n \"If they can\u0027t get out, they\u0027ll have to dig in,\" Chris said. \"Anybody up for a hurricane party?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not funny,\" Nick said sharply, and Cassie said, \"All right, then - tell people to do that. Do whatever they can. And we\u0027d better get back to Crowhaven Road - \"\\n\\n \"With Sean,\" Adam cut in swiftly. \"I\u0027ll get him and meet everybody at my house. Let\u0027s do it, people.\"\\n\\n They left their uneaten lunches - except Suzan, who snagged hers and ran after the others - and headed for the school. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-13.html","bookId":2097,"book":{"id":2097,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Power (The Secret Circle #3)","description":"Storyline: The Secret Circle book 3: The Power \\n United at last with Diana, the mistress of her coven, Cassie must first sacrifice her love for Adam to save the Secret Circle and the town of New Salem from the evil powers of the witch Faye.
