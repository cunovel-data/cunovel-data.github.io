{"id":90564,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"There was a scattering of applause, hesitant, dying away quickly. Already the atmosphere in the auditorium was uncertain, alert. The usual whispers and fidgets snuffed out like candle flames, until the great room was utterly still. All eyes were on the stage.\n He\u0027s a handsome man, Cassie thought, fighting the pounding in her brain that was telling her to run, run. Why did she react so violently to his presence? It was like her reaction on the night of her initiation, when Adam had produced the crystal skull. Cassie had taken one look at it and felt horror creep up her spine - to her, it seemed surrounded by a halo of darkness. It had only been later that she realized not all the coven members could see what she saw.\n As Cassie looked around now, she could tell by the expressions of the other students that they didn\u0027t feel the darkness emanating from the new principal. To her, he cast a shadow across the entire auditorium. To them, he simply seemed powerful, impressive.\n \"I realize there has been some turmoil at New Salem High School recently,\" he was saying, his eyes moving slowly up and down the rows of students. Cassie got the odd impression that he was memorizing each one of them. \"But you\u0027ll be happy to know that\u0027s over now. The - unfortunate occurrences - that have plagued this school are behind us. It\u0027s time for a brand-new start.\"\n \"Turmoil\" meaning two students and one principal dead, Cassie thought. Since you killed all three of them, I guess you can decide when it\u0027s over. At the same time she wondered exactly how he\u0027d managed the murders from his grave. Did the dark energy itself do it? she wondered. She wanted to whisper the question to Nick or Suzan - or Sean, her mind added hastily, guiltily - but it was hard to turn her head away from the man on the stage.\n \"I\u0027ve heard reports that the last administration\u0027s attitude toward discipline was somewhat - lenient. A policy of, shall we say, permissiveness which was undoubtedly intended to be benign.\" The principal glanced toward the teachers lining the auditorium walls, as if to intimate that he knew they might use other words to describe that policy, but there was no point in speaking ill of the dead. \"Certain activities were allowed which were detrimental not only to the students they affected, but also to the very spirit of formal education. Certain groups were afforded special privileges.\"\n What is he talking about? Cassie thought. It\u0027s like a politician; lots of fancy words and no meaning. But something inside her was sinking in dismay.\n \"Well, the policy has changed now, and I think in the end most of you will be pleased with the changes. There\u0027s a new hand on the tiller of this boat.\" The principal held up one hand with a slight, self-deprecating smile.\n Then he started talking again. Afterward, Cassie could never remember exactly what he said, but she remembered his voice, deep, authoritative. Commanding. There were buzzwords scattered through his speech: \"tough love,\" \"old-fashioned discipline,\" \"punishment fitting the crime.\" She could feel the response from the audience: dark, dark. Like something swelling and growing in the crowd. It frightened her almost more than Black John himself. It was as if he were feeding and cultivating some horrible power inside the students. They should have hated him, but instead they were enthralled.\n The rules. The rules must be obeyed. Students who didn\u0027t obey the rules would be sent to the office . . .\n \"I think it\u0027s time for the handout now,\" Jack Brunswick added in a soft aside, and Faye and several other girls moved down from the stage, passing out papers. Cassie watched the principal as he watched the audience, standing at ease, commanding their attention effortlessly even when he wasn\u0027t speaking. Yes, handsome, she thought. He looked something like a young Sherlock Holmes: deep-set eyes, hawk nose, firm mouth. His voice even had traces of an English accent. Cultured, thought Cassie. Cultured - and full of conviction.\n More like a witch hunter than a witch.\n Faye reached Cassie\u0027s row, thrust a sheaf of papers at her. Cassie whispered \"Faye!\" and was rewarded by a swift flash of golden eyes before Faye moved on. Bewildered, Cassie took one handout and passed the rest to Suzan. It was three pages long and covered with small type.\n Prohibited Actions - Type A. Prohibited Actions - Type B. Prohibited Actions - Type C.\n It was a list of rules. But so many rules, line after line after line. Her eyes caught words here and there.\n Wearing clothing inconsistent with the serious and dignified purpose of formal education . . . using a locker or being in the corridors at any time other than the passing period between classes . . . possession or use of squirt guns . . . littering . . . running in the halls . . . chewing gum . . . failing to comply with an order from any teacher or hall monitor . . .\n Hall monitors? Cassie thought. We don\u0027t have hall monitors. Her eyes skimmed on.\n Public displays of affection . . . failing to recycle styrofoam lunch trays . . . placing feet on seats or chair backs . . .\n \"They can\u0027t be serious,\" Suzan whispered. There was a faint whistle from Nick.\n \"You\u0027ll have time in class to go over these guidelines and become thoroughly familiar with them,\" the new principal said. In the corner of Cassie\u0027s eye she saw rows of heads lifting. The rustling of paper stilled.\n \"Right now I\u0027d like to ask for volunteers to be hall monitors. This is a position of great responsibility, so please think carefully before you raise your hand.\"\n Hands flew up all over the auditorium. The students at New Salem High had never volunteered so fast for anything. Cassie saw Portia, rigid and trembling like a hound dog pointing in the air. Sally, in the next seat, was waving madly, like a third-grader dying to get called on by the teacher. The room was like one giant Nazi salute.\n Black John\u0027s eyes moved up and down, scanning them, examining each one.\n Then Cassie realized that Sean\u0027s hand was going up.\n \"Sean!\" she hissed. The auditorium was so quiet she didn\u0027t dare speak loudly. Suzan glanced at Sean, then shrank back from him. He was out of Nick\u0027s reach. \"Sean!\" she said.\n He didn\u0027t seem to hear her. His shiny eyes were fixed on the stage. His face was eager, tense.\n Desperation tingled in the palms of Cassie\u0027s hands. She reached across Suzan to grab his left arm, and with all the power she could summon up, thought: Sean!\n She felt it go out of her like a blast of heat, just as she\u0027d felt it when she was facing the pumpkin-patch dog. A burst of pure power. Sean\u0027s head snapped toward her, his expression full of astonishment.\n \"Put your hand down,\" she whispered, feeling shaky and exhausted in the aftermath. Sean looked at his hand as if he\u0027d never seen it before and hastily snatched it down. He gripped the seat of his chair, eyes still sideways on Cassie.\n Now Suzan was cringing away from her, Cassie realized. Both the strawberry-blond and Sean looked scared. Cassie looked toward the stage and saw the new principal looking directly at her, his lips curved in a faint smile.\n Great. He likes it, and my own friends are afraid of me.\n Black John continued to gaze at her steadily for a moment, then turned the slight smile on the rest of the auditorium.\n \"Very good. Those of you who\u0027ve been chosen will please remain after the assembly to learn about your new duties. The rest are dismissed. Good morning.\"\n Hairs lifted on the back of Cassie\u0027s neck. \"Chosen?\" she whispered, looking around. There hadn\u0027t been any selection. But some of the students who\u0027d had hands up were moving to the stage in a quiet, orderly manner. Portia and Sally were among them.\n Don\u0027t you see? You\u0027ve got to see now how strange this is, Cassie thought, twisting to look at Mr. Humphries standing in the aisle. But Mr. Humphries didn\u0027t seem to find anything unusual about the proceedings. He looked calm and rather pleased as he motioned his class out. Tranquilized, Cassie thought, shivering. Hypnotized.\n Black John was still standing at the lectern. She could feel his eyes on her back as she walked out of the auditorium.\n Cassie fell back as her writing class walked down the hall, slowing to stay with Nick and Suzan and Sean. Suzan and Sean looked at her oddly, but Nick put his arm around her.\n \"That was pretty good,\" he said softly. Cassie felt better, until she noticed he didn\u0027t have his handout.\n \"I left it on the seat,\" he said, and Cassie\u0027s heart sank a little further.\n \"That\u0027s littering,\" she said. \"And littering\u0027s a Type-A offense. Nick, we\u0027ve got to be careful - he\u0027s out to get us.\"\n \"No kidding,\" Adam said, joining them. His blue-gray eyes flickered once over Nick\u0027s arm around Cassie\u0027s shoulders, but his expression didn\u0027t change. \"Have you read over the Prohibited Actions, Type C?\"\n Cassie hadn\u0027t. She thumbed to the last page of the handout and looked. \"Skateboarding, roller-skating, or bike riding . . . playing or wearing radios on school grounds . . . smoking or using tobacco products . . . these are supposed to be worse than Type-B offenses like using drugs or fighting?\"\n \"They seem to be a little specifically directed,\" Adam said grimly.\n And then Cassie knew. She remembered her very first day of school at New Salem High, \"nearly being knocked off her feet by the Henderson brothers - only at the time she didn\u0027t know it was the Henderson brothers. She\u0027d only seen two crazy guys with heavy-metal T-shirts and disheveled blond hair, rollerblading down the halls and listening to Walkmans.\n She swallowed hard. \"They\u0027re for us,\" she whispered. Adam met her eyes, nodding.\n \"Smoking,\" Cassie said. She clutched Nick\u0027s hand, turning to look him full in the face. \"Nick, please, you\u0027ve got to be careful. He wants to get us and we\u0027re not ready to confront him yet . . . Nick!\" She had a terrible feeling about this. Nick hated authority, took any rules as a challenge. Right now she didn\u0027t see any sign of him changing, by his expression. \"Nick!\"\n \"Punishment for Type-C offenses is getting sent to the office,\" Adam said. \"He is trying to get us, Nick. He\u0027s playing his own little game.\"\n \"Nick, I want you to promise me you\u0027ll try not to get in trouble,\" Cassie said. \"Please, Nick. You have to promise.\"\n Nick looked down at her slowly. Cassie tightened her grip on his hand, returning the intensity of his gaze. Please, she was thinking. For me, please.\n Nick\u0027s brow furrowed and he turned away.\n \"Okay,\" he said, nodding slightly, eyes on the ceiling. \"Okay, I\u0027ll try - not to get caught.\"\n Cassie\u0027s muscles relaxed. \"Thank you,\" she whispered, just as Diana, Melanie, and Laurel came up, faces bleak.\n \"Did you get that stuff in the beginning, about the previous administration allowing certain activities to go on?\" Melanie asked. \"That was us he was talking about. The Club and its special privileges. He said all that was going to change now.\"\n Cassie spoke softly. \"He was telling them we\u0027re not in power anymore. He was as good as giving them permission to ...\"\n Her voice died away. She and the other members of the Club looked at one another silently.\n \"Everybody get your guns. Sounds like it\u0027s open season for witches,\" Nick said finally. He put his arm around Cassie again.\n \"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Suzan said.\n \"We can\u0027t,\" said Laurel. \"Leaving school grounds without permission is an offense.\"\n \"Everything is an offense,\" Suzan said.\n \"Where are Chris and Doug?\" Cassie asked sharply. \"And Deborah?\"\n Everyone looked around. Aside from Nick, the Henderson brothers and the biker were the ones most likely to get into trouble.\n \"They have history first period, but I think their class went back without them,\" Sean volunteered. \"I think they\u0027re still in the auditorium.\"\n \"Come on,\" said Adam briefly.\n Chris and Doug were just outside the auditorium. They were in the center of a group of outsider students and they were getting ready to fight.\n \" - not gonna get away with it anymore,\" one of the outsider boys was caroling triumphantly.\n \"Oh, yeah?\" Chris yelled back.\n \"Yeah! Your days are over, man! You\u0027re gonna get sent to the office.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t take them long to catch on,\" Nick murmured in Cassie\u0027s ear.\n \"You\u0027re all going to get sent to the office,\" Adam said, pushing between the outsiders to get to Chris and Doug. He faced them, holding up the handout like a magic talisman. \"Fighting\u0027s a Type-B offense. You\u0027ll all go down for it.\"\n There was a moment of uncertainty, then the outsiders drew back, eyeing each other.\n \"We\u0027ll see you later,\" they decided finally, and turned down the hall. Doug tried to go after them.\n \"Any time, any place,\" he yelled as Nick caught him and held him still. \"Leggo of me!\" he snarled at Nick.\n \"We can\u0027t afford a confrontation yet,\" Diana told him. \"Good job,\" she added to Adam.\n \"It worked - this time,\" Adam said. \"If I\u0027m right about what he\u0027s doing, they\u0027ll eventually figure out that the rules are mainly against us. They may not get in trouble for fighting, but we will.\"\n To Cassie\u0027s vast relief Deborah came around the corner at that moment. \"Deb, where have you been?\"\n \"Watching the hall monitors get their orders. They\u0027re giving them badges like SS men.\"\n \"It is like the Nazis,\" Cassie said.\n \"He\u0027s organizing a witch hunt,\" said Adam.\n \"I wonder if he\u0027s done it before,\" Suzan said.\n Cassie started to say, \"What do you mean?\" but stopped in the middle of it and stared at her. Suzan, who looked so - fluffy, so brainless, who even now was groping in her purse for a compact, had done it again.\n \"And Faye is working for him - \" Diana was saying. Cassie interrupted.\n \"No, wait, listen. Did you hear what Suzan just said? Don\u0027t you get it? I wonder if he\u0027s done it before. You know, I\u0027ll bet he has.\"\n \"In 1692,\" Adam said slowly. \"In Salem. How could we be so stupid?\"\n \"Huh?\" said Chris.\n \"I think they\u0027re saying that Black John could have organized the Salem witch hunt,\" Diana said. \"But - \"\n \"Not organized, maybe, but contributed, helped it along,\" Cassie said. \"Made sure it didn\u0027t just die out, fed the hysteria. Like he was feeding it today.\"\n \"But why?\" asked Laurel.\n There was a silence, then Adam lifted his head, his frown clearing. His voice was grim. \"To get the coven to leave. To follow him. They couldn\u0027t hang around in that atmosphere anymore, so they followed him to New Salem, with all their tools - including the Master Tools.\"\n \"You told me that he was a leader of the original coven,\" Cassie said. \"But I wonder if he was a leader before the coven moved to New Salem - or only after.\"\n The faces of the Circle members were very sober.\n \"I think he\u0027s trying to do the same thing again,\" Adam said. \"Turn everybody against us so we don\u0027t have anywhere else to go - but to him. He\u0027s the only one who can defend us.\"\n \"He can go to hell,\" Deborah said, as if this ought to be obvious.\n \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t think we\u0027re going to come crawling to him right now,\" Nick murmured. \"Things may look a little different in a couple of weeks.\"\n \"I think we\u0027d better have a talk with Faye,\" Diana said.\n They lay in wait for Faye by the back entrance of the auditorium, where Deborah thought she was most likely to come out. When she did she had the clipboard on her arm.\n \"Alone at last,\" Nick said, and they surrounded her, the eleven of them, forcing her to a stop. Looking at the faces of the Circle members right then, Cassie was reminded of the way Faye, Deborah, and Suzan had looked when they had caught her spying on them in front of the school. Beautiful, focused, and deadly. Dangerous.\n Faye looked around at them and tossed her head. It didn\u0027t work as well with her hair gathered up in a bun.\n \"Get out of my way. I have work to do,\" she said.\n \"For him?\" Adam asked tightly. Diana laid a hand on his arm and spoke herself.\n \"Faye, we know you can\u0027t talk now. But we\u0027re going to have a ceremony tonight, because it\u0027s the night of Hecate - \"\n \"And our birthday,\" Chris put in, aggrieved.\n \" - and we want you to be there.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to have a ceremony?\" Faye said, looking less like a rich man\u0027s girl Friday and more like her old self, the black panther. \"You can\u0027t. I\u0027m the coven leader.\"\n \"How can you be the coven leader when you\u0027re never even with the coven? We\u0027re going to have this ceremony tonight, Faye, at the crossroads of Crowhaven and Marsh Street. With or without you. If you\u0027re there, you\u0027re welcome to lead it.\"\n Faye looked for backing from Deborah and Suzan, her age-old supporters. But the biker\u0027s petite face was set in a hard scowl and Suzan\u0027s china-blue eyes were blank. No help was coming from that quarter.\n \"Traitors,\" Faye said contemptuously. Her beautiful, sulky mouth pinched, but she said, \"I\u0027ll be there - to lead the ceremony. Now you\u0027d better get out of here before a hall monitor spots you.\"\n She turned and stalked away.\n They all managed to get through that day without serious trouble, although Suzan received a detention for not throwing away a cupcake wrapper. Not for leaving it at a table or anything, just for not throwing it away as soon as she was done eating. It was a Type-A infraction.\n That night they celebrated the Henderson brothers\u0027 birthday quietly, at Adam\u0027s house. Chris and Doug were extremely disappointed. They wanted a beach party with skinny-dipping. \"And all kinds of wildness,\" Chris said. Adam said it was this or nothing.\n Faye showed up around ten, wearing the black raw-silk shift she\u0027d worn the night of the leadership vote. \"In my day it was white,\" old Mrs. Franklin chuckled, leading her into the untidy living room with its comfortable, shabby furniture. \"But times change.\"\n Faye didn\u0027t even answer her. \"I\u0027m here,\" she said with a haughty glance around. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n Cassie studied the silver diadem nestled in Faye\u0027s midnight-dark hair, the silver bracelet on Faye\u0027s rounded arm, and the garter, made of green leather lined with sky-blue silk, on Faye\u0027s thigh. She wondered what the real ones, the ones used by the original coven, looked like.\n There wasn\u0027t much talking as the seven girls walked slowly down Crowhaven Road. Diana and Faye were in the lead, and Cassie heard Diana speaking in a low voice. The blond girl was carrying a white bag that held the things necessary for casting a circle and beginning a meeting.\n They reached the crossroads. \"It has to be a junction where three roads diverge,\" Diana had said, \"to symbolize the three stages of womanhood: maiden, mother, and crone.\" Here Marsh Street met Crowhaven Road running north and south.\n \"Do we have to be right in the road?\" Suzan said now. \"What if somebody comes driving up?\"\n \"We get out of the way, fast,\" said Laurel.\n \"I think we\u0027re safe,\" Diana said. \"There aren\u0027t many cars this late. Come on, you guys, it\u0027s cold.\"\n \"It\u0027s my ceremony,\" Faye reminded her, taking out the ritual black-handled knife.\n \"I never said it wasn\u0027t,\" Diana said quietly. She stepped back to watch Faye cast the circle. Cassie felt blood burning in her own face as she stood behind Diana, watching Faye do what Diana had always done, what Diana would still be doing - if not for Cassie. She wanted to whisper something to Diana but instead she just made the promise in her own heart.\n Somehow I\u0027ll make things right. Faye won\u0027t be the leader forever. Whatever I have to do, I\u0027ll see to that, she thought. She added, almost absently, I swear by Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-7.html","bookId":2097,"book":{"id":2097,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Power (The Secret Circle #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Secret Circle book 3: The Power \n United at last with Diana, the mistress of her coven, Cassie must first sacrifice her love for Adam to save the Secret Circle and the town of New Salem from the evil powers of the witch Faye.
