{"id":90562,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Cassie opened her mouth to speak, but Nick was going on. \"You know, when I first saw you I thought you were just ordinary,\" he said. \"Then I started noticing things about you - your hair, your mouth. The way you kept on fighting even when you were scared. That night when Lovejoy was killed you were scared to death, but you were the one who suggested we look for the dark energy, and when we were out at the burying ground you kept up with Deborah.\" Nick stopped and grinned ruefully. \"And with us guys,\" he said. Cassie felt an answering smile tug at her own lips; quickly suppressed it. \"Nick, I ...\" \"Don\u0027t say anything yet. I want you to know that I - felt bad about how I treated you when you came to ask me to the dance.\" His jaw was tight, and he looked steadily at one particular flower on the upholstery of the couch. \"I don\u0027t know why I did it - I\u0027ve just got a lousy temper, I guess. I\u0027ve had it so long I don\u0027t even think about it anymore.\" Nick took a deep breath before continuing, \"See, I\u0027ve always hated living with Deb\u0027s parents; I always felt like I owed them something. It put me in a permanent bad mood, I guess. I felt like my mom and dad screwed up somehow, getting themselves killed in a hurricane so their kid had to be supported by other people. It made me hate them - and my aunt and uncle, too.\" Nick stopped and shook his head thoughtfully. \"Yeah, especially Aunt Grace. She talks about my dad all the time, goin\u0027 on and on about how reckless he was, how he didn\u0027t care who he left behind, that kind of crap. It made me sick. I never figured it could be because she missed him.\" Cassie was fascinated. \"Is that why you don\u0027t like magic?\" It was a blind guess, but he looked at her, startled. \"I don\u0027t know - I suppose it could have something to do with it. I resented the rest of the coven because I felt like they all had a better deal than me. They all had at least a grandparent, and I just had my dead parents that screwed up. And they were all so damn cheerful about it - like Conant. He - \" Nick paused and glanced up at Cassie wryly. \"Well, maybe the less said about him, the better. Anyway, I know the truth now. My parents didn\u0027t screw up, and if I screw up I can\u0027t blame them anymore. I\u0027ve got only one person to blame - me. So I\u0027m sorry about the way I acted.\" \"Nick, that\u0027s okay. You did take me to the dance.\" \"Yeah, after you came back and asked again. That took guts. And after I took you we went to Number Thirteen and you got hurt.\" The corner of Nick\u0027s mouth turned down. \"I couldn\u0027t do anything about that. It was Conant who saved you.\" A memory of the smoky thing at the Halloween ceremony, the dark form that had risen out of the Samhain fire, flickered through Cassie\u0027s mind. She shoved it away, feeling panic rise in her chest. She didn\u0027t want to think about Black John now - frightening though he had been as a smoky figure, he was more frightening by far as a man. His eyes . . . \"Cassie.\" Nick\u0027s strong fingers were wrapped around her wrist. \"It\u0027s okay. You\u0027re okay.\" Cassie gulped a deep breath and nodded, her awareness returning to the dim room. \"Thanks,\" she whispered. It felt good to have Nick\u0027s hand on her arm: warm fingers, firm grip. It steadied her. And, God, she\u0027d needed somebody to hang on to, for so long . . . She remembered sitting in Adam\u0027s car, aching with the need to hold him, to be held. And knowing that she couldn\u0027t, that she never could. Cassie had that same ache now, and Adam was completely lost to her. How long did she have to live with the empty feeling? \"I know,\" Nick was saying in a low voice, \"that you\u0027re not in love with me. I know I\u0027m not him. But, Cassie, I like you. I like you a lot, more than any girl I\u0027ve ever seen. You\u0027re so decent to people, you\u0027re not hard, but inside you\u0027re tough as Deb. Tough as me, maybe.\" He laughed shortly. \"You haven\u0027t kept a grudge against anybody in the Club, no matter how they treated you in the beginning. Deb was really surprised about that. And in the end you\u0027ve made them all respect you. The Henderson brothers never fell for a girl before, but they don\u0027t know if they\u0027re on their heads or their feet anymore. I think they\u0027re going to make you a pipe bomb for Christmas.\" Cassie couldn\u0027t help laughing with him. \"Well, I guess that\u0027s one way to get rid of the problem.\" \"Even Faye respects you,\" Nick said. \"She wouldn\u0027t have tried so hard to destroy you otherwise. Look, Cassie, I can\u0027t explain what it is about you - you\u0027re good but you\u0027re tough. You can take it. And you\u0027ve got the most gorgeous eyes I\u0027ve ever seen.\" Cassie felt the blood rising to her face. She could feel his eyes on her, and she was the one forced to study the wallpaper. The hot, strange feeling inside her was stronger every minute. She was thinking about that first week of school, when Deborah and the Henderson brothers had been teasing her, playing keep-away with her backpack - and suddenly a brown arm had reached into her field of vision, catching the backpack, saving her. Nick. And about how nice he\u0027d been in the boiler room when she\u0027d found Jeffrey\u0027s body, how he\u0027d held her and said, \"Steady, steady.\" His arms had been solid and comforting then. Nick wasn\u0027t intimidated by anything. She liked Nick. But liking wasn\u0027t enough. Cassie found herself shaking her head. \"Nick - I\u0027m so sorry. I can\u0027t lead you on ...\" \"I said I knew you weren\u0027t in love with me. But if you just want to give it a try - I\u0027ll be there when you need somebody. We could have some fun,\" he added, as lightly as she\u0027d ever heard Nick speak. \"Get to know each other.\" Cassie thought about how annoyed she\u0027d been a while ago that Adam wasn\u0027t here at Diana\u0027s. She didn\u0027t have the right to demand Adam like that - and it was dangerous. I\u0027ll be there when you need somebody. How could Nick know how important that was to her? She looked up at him, and in a voice she herself could barely hear, she said, \"Okay.\" The mahogany eyes widened slightly in surprise - which by Nick\u0027s normally expressionless standards translated into astonishment. A wondering smile curved his lips a little. He looked so happy that Cassie felt herself drawn into it. Why could she never resist smiling back at him? \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d go for it,\" he said, still wonderingly. Cassie laughed, but blushed harder. \"So why did you ask?\" \"I figured it was worth asking, even if you told me to get lost.\" \"Nick.\" Cassie felt something strange. \"I wouldn\u0027t ever tell you to get lost. You\u0027re - well, you\u0027re really special.\" She didn\u0027t know how to say what she meant, and the words caught in her throat anyway. Her vision was blurring, swimming. She blinked to clear it and felt tears spill. And then Nick moved toward her and somehow she was in his arms, crying on his shoulder. Nothing had ever been so comforting as that gray-wool-clad shoulder. She sniffled and she could feel him leaning his cheek against her hair. \"Let\u0027s just give it a try for a while,\" he said softly. And Cassie nodded and let herself rest in his arms. It was dark when she let Nick out the front door. Diana was upstairs; Chris and Doug had left a long time ago. Cassie felt uncertain and shy as she tapped on Diana\u0027s door. \"Come in,\" Diana said, and Cassie did, remembering the first time she\u0027d tapped on this door and come into this room, the day Diana had rescued her from Faye in the science building. Then, Diana had been sitting at the window seat, surrounded by a whirling crowd of rainbows. Now Diana was sitting at the desk with a pile of papers in front of her. \"So what happened?\" she said, turning around. Cassie could feel the heat in her cheeks. \"I - we - we decided that we would give it a try. Being - well, sort of being together, I mean.\" Diana\u0027s lips parted. She looked into Cassie\u0027s eyes, as if searching for something there. \"You what?\" she said, and then she caught herself. She looked at Cassie for another long moment. \"I see,\" she said slowly. \"You\u0027re not mad?\" Cassie was trying to figure out what was going on behind those emerald-green eyes. \"Mad? How could I be mad at you? I\u0027m just - surprised, that\u0027s all. But don\u0027t worry about it. Nick\u0027s a nice guy, and I know you won\u0027t hurt him. You know how special he is.\" Cassie nodded, but she was startled to hear her own words on Diana\u0027s lips. She hadn\u0027t known Diana knew. \"No, I think it\u0027s a good thing,\" Diana said firmly, pushing the papers out of the way. Cassie breathed a sigh of relief. Then she looked at the papers Diana had been examining when she came in. They were old and yellowing, covered with thick strokes of black writing in columns. The writing had some odd curlicues in it and little punctuation that Cassie could see, but it was legible. \"What are these?\" \"Black John\u0027s personal papers. Letters and things - we gathered them all up when we started looking for the Master Tools. I was looking through them to see if maybe I could find some weakness that we can use against him, to fight him. That\u0027s how we found out where to look for the crystal skull in the first place; he wrote a letter about it to one of Sean\u0027s ancestors and we found it in Sean\u0027s attic. Not giving the exact location of the island, of course, but giving some clues.\" \"I didn\u0027t realize he would trust anybody enough to give them clues.\" \"He didn\u0027t. Apparently, he was planning to go back and get the skull, either to use it or to put it somewhere safer, but he died before he could do it.\" \"He drowned,\" Cassie murmured, turning over a small rectangular paper in her fingers. It was printed Massachusetts-Bay Colony, 8 dollars. Good grief, it was money, money from the 1600s. \"You said that before,\" Diana said, eyeing Cassie thoughtfully. \"I wondered then how you knew.\" \"What? Oh, I guess one of you told me.\" Cassie tried to think. \"Maybe Melanie.\" \"Melanie couldn\u0027t have told you. None of us could have, Cassie, because none of us ever knew it. You\u0027re the first person who\u0027s suggested he died at sea.\" \"But . . .\" Bewildered, Cassie searched her mind, trying to think where she\u0027d come up with the idea. \"But then how . . .\" Suddenly she knew. \"My dreams,\" she whispered, backing up to the bed. \"Oh, Diana, he\u0027s been in my dreams. I dreamed about drowning, about being on a ship that was going down. But it wasn\u0027t me, it was him. It was Black John.\" \"Cassie.\" Diana came over and sat down beside her. \"Are you sure it was him?\" \"Yes. Because it happened again today, when I saw him at the cemetery. I looked into his eyes - and then I felt myself falling. Drowning. There was salt water all around me, and it was cold. I could taste it.\" Diana put her arms around Cassie\u0027s heaving shoulders. \"Don\u0027t think about it anymore.\" \"I\u0027m all right,\" Cassie whispered. \"But why would he make me go through that? Why would he put it in my head? Is he trying to kill me?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Diana said, her voice unsteady. \"Cassie, I told you before, you don\u0027t have to stay here - \" \"I do, though.\" Cassie thought of her grandmother, and words echoed in her mind. There\u0027s nothing frightening in the dark, if you just face it. The ocean was dark, dark as midnight underwater, and cold as hematite. But I can face that, Cassie thought. I refuse to be afraid of it. I refuse. She pushed the fear away from her and slowly felt the trembling inside her steady. My line has the sight and the power, she thought. I want to use that power to stand up to him. To face him. She drew away from Diana. \"I think you\u0027ve got the right idea tonight,\" she said, nodding at the papers on the desk. \"You go through those, and your Book of Shadows, and I\u0027ll keep going through mine.\" She looked at the window seat where the red leather-covered book lay beside a block of multicolored Post-it notes and a scattering of felt-tip pens and highlighters. \"Have you found anything interesting so far?\" Diana asked as Cassie settled into the window seat with the book on her lap. \"Nothing about Black John. In the beginning the spells seem to be pretty much the same as yours. But everything in it\u0027s interesting, and who knows what\u0027s going to turn out to be useful in the end,\" Cassie said. She was determined to get familiar with the range of spells and amulets in the book, to learn as many as possible of them and to at least know where to find the rest. Still, it was a project that would take years, and they didn\u0027t have years. \"Diana, I think we\u0027d better talk to the old ladies in town - soon. Before - well, before anything happens so we can\u0027t talk to them.\" She met Diana\u0027s eyes grimly. Diana blinked, taking in Cassie\u0027s meaning, and then nodded. \"You\u0027re right. He\u0027s already killed four people, at least. If he thinks they\u0027re a threat . . .\" She swallowed. \"We\u0027ll talk to them tomorrow. I\u0027ll tell Adam when he calls - he\u0027s supposed to call me when he and Deborah get through shadowing Black John.\" \"I hope Black John doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s being shadowed,\" Cassie said. \"I hope so too,\" Diana said quietly, and bent her head over the papers again. The meeting was held the next day on the beach. Faye didn\u0027t have a chance to veto the location because Faye wasn\u0027t there. \"She\u0027s with him,\" Deborah said briefly. \"I followed her this morning - Adam and I flipped for it last night. She met him at that same coffee shop where they met yesterday - \" \"Hang on, hang on,\" Laurel said. \"You\u0027re getting ahead of yourself. What coffee shop?\" \"I\u0027ll tell it,\" Adam said, in response to Diana\u0027s look. \"Yesterday we went out of the cemetery and followed - Mr. Brunswick. That\u0027s a joke, by the way.\" Diana nodded. \"I used to do a little oil-painting, and Brunswick is a kind of paint,\" she told Cassie and the group. \"Black paint.\" \"Very funny,\" said Cassie. She was sitting beside Nick, a new position, and one that made her slightly self-conscious. She was very aware of him, of his arm beside her. If she leaned a little to the right, she could touch him, and it was comforting. \"I wonder what he did with the real person who was supposed to be principal,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know.\" Adam couldn\u0027t have helped but notice who she was sitting by, and the new expression in Nick\u0027s eyes, a sort of protectiveness. Right now Cassie could see his blue-gray gaze flicker toward Nick, looking him up and down narrowly. It wasn\u0027t a friendly look. \"I don\u0027t know how he managed to get the position. I don\u0027t know why he would want it, either.\" He glanced at Nick again and opened his mouth, but Diana was talking. \"Go on with the story. Go on, Adam. Tell us what happened when you followed him yesterday.\" \"Huh? Oh, right. Well, he left alone, in a gray Cadillac, and we followed; Deborah on her bike and me in my jeep. He drove into town and went to the Perko\u0027s Koffee Kup there - and guess who drove up a few minutes later?\" \"Wearing a black lace minidress and looking really perky,\" Deborah put in. \"Faye,\" Diana whispered, looking sick. \"How could she?\" \"I dunno, but she did,\" Deborah said. \"We watched her through the window, and she went to his booth. He\u0027s a living, breathing man, all right - he was drinking coffee. They talked for about an hour. Faye was prancing and tossing her head like a little filly in a show. And he seemed to like it - anyway, he was smiling at her.\" \"We waited until they left, then Deb followed her and I followed him,\" Adam said. \"He drove to a summer cottage on the mainland - I guess he\u0027s rented it. He stayed there all night, I think; I finally left around one in the morning.\" \"Where did Faye go?\" Melanie asked Deborah. Deborah made a face. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because she lost me, okay? Riding a Harley isn\u0027t exactly inconspicuous. She started going through red lights and suddenly making U-turns, and in the end she lost me. You want to make something out of it?\" \"Deb,\" Cassie said. Deborah scowled at her, then rolled her eyes and shrugged. \"Anyway, this morning I waited outside her house, and she went back to meet him. They had a booth at the back, though, not near a window. So I went inside, but I really couldn\u0027t see what was going on. I think she gave him something, but I don\u0027t know what.\" \"Wonderful,\" Suzan said, and Deborah glared at her. \"I mean, wonderful that she\u0027s - what do you call it? In league with him. Is anybody going to eat that doughnut?\" Suzan daintily shook off powdered sugar and bit in. Laurel murmured something about white sugar being worse than rat poison, but she didn\u0027t have the energy to say more. \"It\u0027s good,\" Suzan said indistinctly. \"The only thing it\u0027s missing is cream filling.\" \"I think we\u0027d better go talk with the old ladies,\" Cassie said. \"With Adam\u0027s grandmother, I mean, and Laurel\u0027s grandmother and Melanie\u0027s great-aunt.\" \"Today\u0027s a good day,\" Melanie volunteered. \"Every Sunday afternoon they get together and have lunch at our place: a kind of tea, you know, with sandwiches and little cakes and stuff.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Cassie said. \"My grandmother used to go too.\" \"Cakes?\" said Suzan, looking interested. \"Why didn\u0027t you say so? Let\u0027s go.\" \"Right - no, wait,\" Diana said. She looked around the group. \"Look, it\u0027s probably pointless to ask this, but did any of you take the piece of hematite out of Cassie\u0027s room?\" Everyone stared at her, then at each other. Everyone except Cassie and Laurel. Heads were shaken, and all the faces wore the same look of puzzlement. \"Somebody took the hematite?\" Deborah asked. \"The piece you found at Number Thirteen?\" Cassie nodded, unobtrusively studying the other members of the Circle. Adam was frowning, the Henderson brothers looked blank. Sean looked nervous, but then Sean always looked nervous. Melanie seemed troubled, Nick was slowly shaking his head, and Suzan was shrugging. \"I didn\u0027t think anybody would admit to it,\" Diana said. \"But I suspect that\u0027s because the person who took it isn\u0027t here. She\u0027s at Perko\u0027s Koffee Kup.\" Diana sighed. \"All right. Let\u0027s go to Number Four.\" Cassie had been getting quite familiar with Melanie\u0027s house since her mother had been taken to stay there. The house was in the Federal style, very similar to Cassie\u0027s grandmother\u0027s, but in much better repair. The white clapboard walls were freshly painted and everything inside had a shipshape, tidy look. Great-aunt Constance was sitting in the front parlor with old Mrs. Franklin, Adam\u0027s grandmother, and Laurel\u0027s Granny Quincey. She didn\u0027t look at all pleased to see the eleven of them crowding in the parlor door. \"Great-aunt Constance? Can we talk to you?\" The elderly woman turned a cool, disapproving eye on Melanie. She was thin and regal, and in her high-cheekboned face Cassie could detect some resemblance to Melanie\u0027s classic beauty. Her hair was still very dark, but maybe she dyed it. \"Are you here to see your mother?\" she said, spotting Cassie in the group. \"She\u0027s fast asleep right now; I really don\u0027t think she should be disturbed.\" \"Actually, Aunt Constance, we came to talk to you,\" Melanie said. She looked at the other women in the parlor. \"To all three of you.\" A line appeared between Great-aunt Constance\u0027s eyebrows, but the short plump woman sitting on the sofa said, \"Oh, let them in, Connie. Why not? There you are, Adam. What kept you out so late last night, hm?\" \"I didn\u0027t realize you noticed, Grandma,\" Adam said. \"Oh, I notice more than people think,\" Mrs. Franklin chuckled, picking up a cookie and popping it into her mouth. Her gray hair was piled untidily on her head in braids, and there was a disorganized air about her that contrasted with the austere white and gold parlor. Cassie liked her. \"What\u0027s going on, Laurel?\" a quavery voice asked, and Cassie looked at Granny Quincey, a tiny woman with a face like a dried apple. She was actually Laurel\u0027s great-grandmother, and she was so little and light she looked as if a puff of wind would blow her away. \"Well - \" Laurel looked at Adam, who spoke up. \"Actually, it has something to do with what my grandmother asked me. What I was out doing last night. And it has to do with something that happened a long time ago, right around the time all of us kids were born.\" Great-aunt Constance was really frowning now, and Granny Quincey\u0027s lips were pursed together. Old Mrs. Franklin was chuckling, but she was looking around the room in a way that made Cassie wonder if she\u0027d really heard her grandson. \"Well?\" Great-aunt Constance said sharply. \"Explain yourself.\" Adam glanced back at the rest of the Circle, all of whom were beaconing their support, silently electing him spokesman. He took a deep breath and turned back to the old women. \"What I was out doing was shadowing our new high-school principal, Mr. Jack Brunswick,\" he said. The name elicited no reaction. \"I think you might have known him under a different name.\" Utter silence. \"The name we\u0027re all most familiar with is Black John,\" said Adam. The silence was shattered as Great-aunt Constance stood so abruptly that one of the fragile willow-patterned tea cups dashed to the floor. \"Get out of this house! Get out!\" she said to Adam.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-power-the-secret-circle-3/page-5.html","bookId":2097,"book":{"id":2097,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Power (The Secret Circle #3)","description":"Storyline: The Secret Circle book 3: The Power United at last with Diana, the mistress of her coven, Cassie must first sacrifice her love for Adam to save the Secret Circle and the town of New Salem from the evil powers of the witch Faye.
