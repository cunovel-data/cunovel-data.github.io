{"id":98501,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"You are certain that we are alone?\" Brother Braumin asked as he and Elbryan walked through the afternoon shadows of the forest outside of Dundalis. A myriad of patterns speckled the ground before them as sunlight snaked its way through the bare branches. The snow had melted a few inches in the week since the storm, but the pair still had to slog through some uncomfortably deep drifts. The ranger shrugged. \"Who can know?\" he admitted. \"Bradwarden is not about - of that I am fairly certain. And no men are nearby, unless they are men of the forest, walking silently, without disturbing even the most skittish of birds. Roger Lockless, perhaps - he is known for hearing what he should not, and seeing what he should not.\" \"And of course, the elves,\" Brother Braumin added. \"They could be but a body\u0027s length away and not even Nightbird would know it, I guess, if they did not want him to.\" Elbryan conceded the point with a nod. Indeed, he had seen little sign of Ni\u0027estiel and the others since the fight, though he had heard a couple of elven voices lifted in song one quiet night. They were still about, but what that meant, the ranger was no longer sure. Why hadn\u0027t they warned them, and why hadn\u0027t they been more involved in the fight that had cost four men their lives? And, perhaps most perplexing of all, why hadn\u0027t they come to Nightbird afterward, at least to explain? The ranger eagerly looked forward to that meeting, if it ever came, for even if Lady Dasslerond was among their ranks, he meant to speak loudly and not favorably. \"But we are as secure as we can hope to be, it seems,\" said Brother Braumin. He slowed and looked long and hard at Elbryan, drawing the ranger\u0027s gaze. \"I have a request,\" he said solemnly. Elbryan continued to stare, not knowing what to expect. He feared that Braumin would ask about the stolen gemstones, Pony\u0027s gemstones - and rightfully so, by Elbryan\u0027s thinking! - and then he would calmly have to put the man off. \"My friends and I are out here alone,\" Braumin stated. \"By deserting St.-Mere-Abelle, we have severed our ties to the Abellican Church.\" \"That much seems obvious,\" Elbryan replied. \"Though, given your Father Abbot\u0027s thirst for vengeance, I would say that you must hope and pray that those ties are truly severed.\" Braumin managed to grin briefly at the ranger\u0027s sarcasm. \"Severed on our part, at least,\" he clarified. \"And thus we have become men without a home - and worse, Nightbird, we have become men without a purpose.\" \"You have found friends here in Dundalis and anonymity in the vastness of the Timberlands forests,\" the ranger replied. \"I do not believe that Sha-mus and the soldiers knew who you were, had any idea at all that you were of the Church. And so, perhaps you have found a quiet existence. There are worse fates.\" \"True, but do not forget that we are men of purpose, men who have devoted all our lives, from the last days of childhood, to the study of God,\" Braumin explained. \"This was our calling, a divine calling, we all believe, for only such deep-rooted convictions will allow one to attain the levels of piety necessary even to enter St.-Mere-Abelle.\" The ranger\u0027s eyes widened at that prideful declaration. \"I speak humbly,\" Braumin quickly added, \"and speak only the truth. Absolute dedication is required of any would-be student of the Abellican Order.\" \"And yet you deserted that Order.\" \"Because we learned the truth of Father Abbot Dalebert Markwart\u0027s interpretation of the Abellican Order,\" Braumin said, his voice rising. He glanced around nervously and quickly lowered his voice to a harsh whisper. \"Because Master Jojonah taught us that, as your friend Avelyn Desbris taught it to him.\" The ranger had no argument; he felt Avelyn had also taught him much about the truth of God. \"We did not desert the Order,\" Brother Braumin asserted. \"We fol-lowed the true spirit of the Abellicans, a journey that forced us from St.- Mere-Abelle.\" \"And so you have come all the way to Dundalis,\" Elbryan reasoned, \"and yet you feel that your journey is not complete, that the simple life of this region will not fulfill your spiritual needs.\" Now it was Braumin\u0027s turn to stop and stare, for the ranger\u0027s blunt asser-tion had taken him by surprise. \"Could you not build a church here and teach the song of God as you hear it?\" the ranger asked. \"And how long would such a church be allowed to survive, so close to Honce-the-Bear and the Abellican Order?\" Braumin asked skeptically. \"Then it is fear and not purpose that will push you further.\" The monk\u0027s face screwed up with confusion, and then, as he figured out that the ranger was teasing him, he suddenly laughed. \"It was fear that drove us from St.-Mere-Abelle,\" he admitted after a moment, \"and yet, in a way, we were all more afraid of leaving than staying.\" Elbryan nodded. \"You said you had a request,\" the ranger said. \"What would you have me do?\" Braumin took a deep breath, yet another hint to Elbryan that this request was no small thing. \"I would have you lead my friends and me to the Barbacan,\" he said quickly. Elbryan wondered which frightened Braumin more - asking for help or stating his intentions out loud. \"The Barbacan?\" the ranger echoed incredulously. \"I have seen the glory of Avelyn\u0027s tomb,\" Brother Braumin said sin-cerely. \"I know I must go there now; Brother Dellman, feels he, too, must return there. The others must see it; it is a pilgrimage necessary if we five are truly to become of one mind and one purpose.\" \"And that purpose is . . . ?\" \"I hope the pilgrimage will show me,\" Braumin admitted. \"The Barbacan is still a hostile land,\" Elbryan pointed out. \"The destruc-tion of the dactyl and the defeat of the monstrous army has done little to tame the northland. Perhaps I could get you there, but then what? That you might stay only a matter of days, or even hours, then take the road back to Dundalis again?\" \"Perhaps,\" Braumin said honestly, \"perhaps not. I believe in my heart that Avelyn will show us our true course. He gave his life for the good of the world and in death he reached for the heavens. There is something magi-cal about that place, something healing and godly. I felt that keenly when I viewed the tomb.\" \"More than three hundred miles of wild land is a long way to travel in hopes of inspiration,\" the ranger said dryly. \"Yet it is the only road before us,\" Braumin replied. \"I know that I am asking much of you, but I do so in the name of Avelyn, and in the hope that he, and Jojonah, have not died in vain.\" That set the ranger back. He wasn\u0027t sure that this journey to the Bar-bacan would accomplish anything more than getting them all killed or sending them all running back to Dundalis battered and humbled. Still, there seemed a greater measure of sincerity in the man, and a huge determi-nation. Braumin had lived as a monk for years and understood the inner working of the Abellican Church far better than Elbryan ever could. Could Elbryan deny the possibility that such inspiration might come to a man who had willingly given his life to the search for God and good? Besides, the ranger, too, had seen where Avelyn was buried shortly after the explosion. Though he understood that Avelyn had extended his arm upward hoping to keep the pouch of sacred gemstones and Tempest safe, there was some-thing mystical - or at least a very fortunate coincidence - that Avelyn\u0027s extended arm had somehow reached above the destruction. \"You understand the dangers?\" the ranger asked. \"I understand the futility of not going,\" Braumin replied, \"for then we are dead, all five of us, spiritually if not physically. And perhaps worse than physical death is the notion of spiritual impotence, of our voices silenced under the smothering blanket of Father Abbot Markwart.\" \"And the Barbacan will change this?\" Braumin gave a shrug. \"I know that I must journey to the grave of Avelyn, and so must my companions, and we shall go, with or without Nightbird.\" The ranger didn\u0027t doubt him. \"Progos is but half gone,\" Elbryan rea-soned. \"Winter is here - you have seen her fury, and I assure you that the snow which fell the night before Shamus Kilronney arrived was no unusual storm for this part of the world. I do not know when the trails north will be clear. And even if they are clear, know that the wind among the mountains ringing Aida and Avelyn\u0027s grave could freeze the blood in your body quickly.\" \"The dangers are not ignored,\" Braumin assured him, \"nor will they stop us.\" Elbryan looked hard at the man, at his determination in the face of potential disaster, and he was impressed. \"I will speak with Bradwarden,\" he offered. \"The centaur knows the northern terrain better than I and has animal friends who might better give us some idea of what we will encounter.\" \"We?\" Braumin noted hopefully. \"No promise, Brother Braumin,\" the ranger responded, but it seemed clear to both of them that Nightbird would guide the group. That notion struck the ranger, for he had no intention or desire to ever return to the for-lorn remnants of Aida - indeed, a little over a week before, until his strange dream about Pony, he had thought his road was in the opposite direction! No, he could not call it a dream. Pony had come to him in his sleep - he knew that without doubt - and their roads could not cross again just yet. Was he now thinking of going so far north out of spite, out of some anger at Pony? He did not have the answer, but he realized that he needed to sit down and figure it out before committing to the journey. \"You should go,\" Roger asserted, walking at the ranger\u0027s side through the dark forest. \"These are good men, every one.\" Elbryan gave no reply. He had already explained to Roger all the prob-lems of such a journey - not the least was that if he left he would be abdi-cating his responsibilities to Tomas Gingerwart for a month or more. \"I worked in St.-Mere-Abelle,\" Roger went on, \"and I can attest to the courage Brother Braumin and his companions showed in leaving the place. What they did to Jojonah - \" Elbryan held up his hand; he had heard it all before - in the last few min-utes actually. \"Let us learn what Bradwarden thinks of such a journey,\" he said. \"I do not doubt Brother Braumin\u0027s sincerity, or even his judgment in claiming that he and his friends should go to Mount Aida. If I did, I would not even be talking with Bradwarden this night. But there are larger issues to be considered.\" \"Pony,\" Roger remarked. \"That is one,\" the ranger admitted, and he ducked under a branch and around a chestnut tree, to the edge of a clearing opposite the centaur. \"And the season is another.\" \"Ye\u0027re late,\" Bradwarden said, his tone grim. A moment later, catching a rustle in the tree above, the ranger under-stood the source of his friend\u0027s discontent. As he focused his gaze on the shadows above, a pair of elves moved down and into view, dropping to the lowest branch. The ranger\u0027s eyes widened. \"Why do you seem so surprised, Nightbird?\" said the female of the pair, Tiel\u0027marawee by name - or nickname, for the ranger did not know her real name. Indeed, that true name had been lost to the ages, Juraviel had told a younger Elbryan during his days in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness. To all the Touel\u0027alfar, she was Tiel\u0027marawee, \"songbird,\" a title most fitting for one whose melodious voice was legendary even among the beautiful voices of the elves. \"I had thought our alliance ended,\" the ranger replied grimly, \"with the Touel\u0027alfar turned down other roads. It has been many days.\" \"A long while only to the impatience of a human,\" said Ni\u0027estiel, assum-ing a more defiant posture on the branch. After an uncomfortable moment in which the elf and ranger locked simmering stares, Ni\u0027estiel stood on the branch and gave a sweeping bow, smiling from ear to ear. The ranger didn\u0027t smile in return. \"As you say,\" Elbryan conceded. \"And yet, the children of Caer\u0027alfar did not see their way to warn Nightbird of the impending goblin attack, and did little to fend off those monsters, though their bows would have proven invaluable.\" \"Or they did not know that Nightbird would be among the soldiers,\" Tiel\u0027marawee replied. \"And that excuses ...\" Elbryan started to ask, but he stopped, remind-ing himself of the true nature of these creatures. Elves were not humans, however Elbryan might wish to pretend otherwise. Their view of the world did not correspond to those attributes - compassion and community - that Elbryan would seek in humans. Still, the ranger could not completely excuse the lack of warning and aid, for the choice of allies among humans and goblins should not be a difficult one, from any point of view. \"Four men died,\" he said grimly, \"and another three were grievously ...\" He let itdrop again as he considered his audience, as he realized that the expres-sions of both elves had not changed, would not change. The life of a human was not important to a being that would likely outlive twenty generations of men. And these two, Tiel\u0027marawee and Ni\u0027estiel, if Elbryan remembered them correctly from his time in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, were among the most dispassionate of the elven people with regard ton\u0027Touel\u0027alfar, anyone who was not elven. That thought struck him profoundly then, for, that being the case, why were these two the ones to come forward and speak with him? Where was Juraviel? And where Lady Dasslerond? The ranger didn\u0027t like the implications. \"Well, Nightbird was among the soldiers, and he, too, might have been slain,\" the ranger said at last, thinking to end that part of the discussion. Ni\u0027estiel wouldn\u0027t let him be done with it so easily. \"And if he had been slain by mere goblins, then perhaps he would have shown that he was not worthy of the name Tai\u0027marawee, the name the Touel\u0027alfar gave to him with confidence,\" the elf said with a sarcastic laugh, and Tiel\u0027marawee joined in the mirth; but it seemed to Elbryan as if the pair were only half kidding. \"But that is past now, and we need look to the road ahead,\" Tiel\u0027-marawee remarked in a leading manner. Elbryan turned a surprised look on Bradwarden. \"They know?\" \"Elfy ears,\" the centaur replied. \"You consider a journey to the Barbacan,\" Ni\u0027estiel stated flatly, \"to the place of the dactyl demon\u0027s destruction.\" \"To the tomb of Brother Avelyn Desbris,\" Roger said solemnly. The elves didn\u0027t seem much impressed. \"And how do the Touel\u0027alfar view such a journey?\" Elbryan asked. \"Why would the Touel\u0027alfar care?\" asked Ni\u0027estiel. \"Your road is your own to choose, Nightbird,\" Tiel\u0027marawee added. \"We will help where we may.\" \"And if ye so choose,\" Bradwarden added dryly. \"There is always that,\" admitted Ni\u0027estiel. \"Have you been able to determine the security of the region?\" the ranger asked Bradwarden. He had spoken with the centaur earlier that day, explaining Brother Braumin\u0027s request and also reminding Bradwarden of his duty to Tomas Gingerwart and his promise to help with the rebuilding of the Timberland towns. \"No sign o\u0027 the goblins, or any other monster scum in the area,\" said the centaur. \"Them that got free o\u0027 the battle kept on runnin\u0027, by me own thinkin\u0027.\" \"Not a sign of potential trouble anywhere in the region,\" Tiel\u0027marawee added. \"And we\u0027re to be believin\u0027 yerself?\" the centaur asked. But it was Elbryan who answered, stating firmly that he did believe the elves. He understood them, and so did Bradwarden, if the centaur could only look past his present anger at this pair. While the Touel\u0027alfar might on occasion stand by and allow humans to be slaughtered - they had done so, for example, during the destruction of the original Dundalis, when Elbryan\u0027s own family had been killed - but they would never favor goblins and other monsters over humans. If these two said now that they saw no signs of monsters in the area, then Elbryan believed them completely - and so did Bradwarden, as the centaur admitted with a derisive snort and a wave of his huge arms. \"Then what am I to do?\" Elbryan asked. \"Truly I do not desire to jour-ney to the Barbacan - not ever again - but these men have placed a great trust in me by simply coming to the northland in search of me. And they are disciples of Avelyn, heart and soul. Of that I have no doubt.\" \"Then you owe your dead friend this favor, at least,\" Roger said hopefully. \"I been thinkin\u0027 that a journey to the north might not be a bad thing,\" Bradwarden offered. \"Besides, I ain\u0027t seen this grave everyone\u0027s been talkin\u0027 of.\" \"Nor have I,\" said Roger. Elbryan nodded as each of them was speaking, his road coming clearer before him. The centaur looked up at the elves. \"And what o\u0027 ye two?\" he asked. \"We may go,\" said Tiel\u0027marawee. \"Or we may not,\" Ni\u0027estiel quickly added. They had a private agenda here, Elbryan understood, one given them by Lady Dasslerond and one, he believed, that concerned him. He still couldn\u0027t understand why Lady Dasslerond hadn\u0027t come out to speak with him personally on so important a matter. Or Juraviel. . . . where was his dearest friend among the Touel\u0027alfar at this critical time? A disturbing thought crossed his mind then: perhaps Lady Dasslerond, Juraviel, and the others hadn\u0027t followed the monks to the north - perhaps these two elves alone had come to the Timberlands. \"All we\u0027re needin\u0027 to do now is wait for the weather to allow it,\" Bradwarden remarked. \"And I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 that to be a long and frustratin\u0027 wait!\" The ranger didn\u0027t disagree in the least. He knew what winter could mean in the Timberlands: days, weeks of sitting in the dim light of a low- burning fire, using only the wood needed to keep the room warm enough for sur-vival, staring at the bare walls and at the companions who had long begun to grate on one\u0027s nerves. The ranger and Roger turned back for the town then, moving to a heavy tent pegged to the southern wall of the large meetinghouse. Braumin and the other five monks were already inside, some sitting on their hands, all looking very nervous. \"If we can get the agreement of Tomas Gingerwart and the soldiers that the area is secure, I will lead you to the Barbacan,\" Elbryan announced at once, dispelling the tension. There came a chorus of quiet cheers and excited whispers. \"Three hundred miles and more,\" the ranger warned them, his tone grim, \"a longer and more difficult trek than the one that brought you from Palmaris to this place.\" \"Not so difficult,\" remarked the quiet Brother Mullahy, his voice barely audible. \"Nor so long,\" added an almost giddy Brother Viscenti. \"We should know more of the disposition of the immediate area by midday tomorrow,\" Elbryan assured Brother Braumin, \"that we might begin our preparations.\" \"And when shall we leave?\" asked an impatient Brother Castinagis. \"When the wind will not kill us and the snow will not bury us,\" the ranger replied firmly. \"The beginning of Bafway, perhaps, or the end of it.\" All the eager monks looked disappointed by that proclamation, but the ranger would not be swayed by their foolish hopes. \"To leave prematurely would bring only disaster,\" he said. \"You have seen the snow and heard and felt the bite of the wind. Yet we are south here, far south, of Avelyn\u0027s grave, and at a much lower elevation. Up there, in the north among the mountains, the snow lies deeper, and the bite of the wind will kill the stron-gest of men. Do not doubt my words. The season has been mild thus far, and if that continues, we may begin our trek shortly before the turn of Bafway. But no sooner - even if the sun came out tomorrow with such strength that we stripped off our clothes and basked in its warmth!\" With that, the ranger bowed and left the tent; but Roger did not follow, preferring to stay and share the occasion with his newfound friends, a moment of happiness that could not be dulled too much by the ranger\u0027s last grim warning. Elbryan started for Tomas Gingerwart\u0027s tent, but changed his mind. Tomas wouldn\u0027t be difficult to persuade; the more important ally in this matter was the man who would likely replace him as primary guardian of the new settlers. He found Shamus awake, strolling about the perimeter of the Kingsmen\u0027s camp, his eyes raised to the stars, his hands clasped behind his back, his face a mask of concern. That mask changed, but far from convincingly, when he noted Elbryan\u0027s approach. \"When winter breaks, my road will take me from this place for some weeks,\" the ranger said bluntly. \"I will travel to the north with some men.\" \"North?\" asked a surprised Shamus. \"But our duty is here, rebuilding the Timberlands.\" \"I will not go until I have been assured that the region is secured,\" the ranger replied. \"And I will not be gone for long - a month at the most. Also, I leave Tomas Gingerwart and his fellows in the capable hands ofCaptain Shamus Kilronney and a contingent of the King\u0027s own soldiers. What role can I fill with such capable companions all about?\" \"You flatter me, ranger,\" Shamus said with a disarming grin. \"But if the region is secure, as you state, then perhaps I can accompany you.\" \"Not necessary,\" Elbryan replied, his tone showing Shamus that there was no room for debate. \"What business could these men possibly have in the northlands?\" Shamus inquired. \"This is the land rich in valued timber, and surely there are ample trees here to supply the masts of a thousand thousand great sailing ships.\" \"They will go north in search of riches of a different sort,\" Elbryan replied cryptically, \"and I believe they might just find what they are seeking.\" \"So Nightbird plans to get rich?\" Shamus asked with a chuckle. \"Perhaps,\" the ranger replied in all seriousness, his tone taking the mirth from the other man. \"Your road is your own to choose,\" the captain said somberly, sounding very much like the detached Tiel\u0027marawee at that moment. \"I only hope that you will not be gone from us for long - and that you will reconsider my offer to journey along with you.\" \"I will, to both,\" said Elbryan and he bid the captain a good night and moved back into the forest. Shamus stayed outside for a long while after Elbryan had departed, con-sidering carefully the words and their implications. The captain was more than a little unsettled by the sight of Bradwarden the fugitive, and by his realization that Nightbird meant to accompany the six men who had recently joined the settlers. More than a few hints had indicated to Shamus that these men were, or had been, Abellican monks, including one quiet, and quickly corrected, reference one had made to another as \"brother.\" Had Nightbird perhaps figured out that Shamus was acting as an agent of De\u0027Unnero? As he stood musing over that possibility and coming to the conclusion that such could not be the case, Shamus heard the approach of the little man, smallest of the group of six. Roger walked by swiftly, nodding only slightly to acknowledge the captain. \"Nightbird told me that he will accompany your group to the north,\" Shamus said behind him, stopping him in his tracks. Roger swung about, eyeing the captain - surprised but not suspicious, for by Roger\u0027s under-standing, the soldiers of the Baron, and thus the soldiers of the King, were on his side against the Church. \"And so he will,\" Roger replied. \"And glad are we six for the company.\" \"A valuable ally on so dangerous a journey,\" Shamus said. \"The first part will likely be the worst,\" said Roger. \"If the rumors of the extent of the catastrophe at Mount Aida prove true, it is doubtful that any monsters have returned to that blasted place.\" Shamus did well to hide his surprise. They were going to the Barbacan! \"Still, I do not understand,\" he said. \"Why would you venture to such a forlorn place as that? \" Now Roger went on the alert. He didn\u0027t mistrust the captain, but he understood the monks\u0027 need for secrecy and feared that he might already have said too much - though he assumed Elbryan had already told Shamus at least as much. \"Who can rightly say?\" Roger replied. \"There are many places in the world that I have not seen and that I wish to see. Some are merely more convenient than others.\" Hoping he had covered his tracks, Roger gave a great yawn and explained that it was past time for him to retire. Shortly thereafter, Shamus Kilronney handed a rolled parchment to his most trusted rider and ordered the man to ride south, braving the weather and snow-blocked road, to get to Palmaris and Bishop De\u0027Unnero. Shamus understood that he was only doing his duty as a sworn officer of the King - and he told himself that repeatedly - but he felt uneasy about betraying Nightbird, even if the man was in the presence of a known criminal. PART FOUR THE HEART AND SOUL OF CORONA I never thought of it before, Uncle Mather, because it never seemed an issue and, truly, never seemed to matter. And, perhaps more to the point, because no one had ever before asked. Is Danube Brock Ursal not Nightbird\u0027s king? is what Shamus inquired of me, a simple question to the ears, but one that caught me so off guard that I knew not what to answer. I offered some words in response, but I still have not sorted out the answer that is in my heart. Am I a homeless rogue? I spent my childhood in Dundalis, but that place is no more, even if new buildings are constructed on its ruins.Igrew to manhood in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, among the elves, whom I consider the dearest of friends. But family? No, I cannot rightly call Belli\u0027mar Juraviel my brother, nor Lady Dasslerond my queen. I love Juraviel as I would a sibling, to be sure, and would heed the commands of Lady Dasslerond, but it is a simple fact of our physical beings that we cannot view the world in the same manner. Elven eyes perceive a different hue of truth and meaning than those of humans. So Andur\u0027Blough Inninness is not, cannot be, my home, however I might wish it to be. Upon my return to the elven valley, I was not even allowed entrance. Juraviel once labeled me asn\u0027Touel\u0027alfar,and though I argued it with him, even convinced him of my way of thinking, we both understand the truth of those words: Elbryan - Nightbird - for all his training and all the love, is not of the people of Caer\u0027alfar. Lady Dasslerond is not my queen; does that, by default, leave Danube as my king? No, Uncle Mather, and I understand now that his father before him was no king to you. Homeless rogues, we two? Hardly. For my home is here, in the forests of the Timberlands, in the Wilderlands, in the fields of northern Honce-the-Bear, or in the steep and rocky slopes of southern Alpinador, if I so choose. This is yet another aspect of the life of a ranger that has only recently come clear to me. Home is a feeling, not a place; and that feeling, for a ranger, is a portable thing, a matter of terrain, perhaps, but never of walls. I am home here in the forests of the Timberlands because of the feeling in my heart whenever I return to this place. So speak not to me of kings and queens, tell me not of empires and kingdoms. Whichever ruler extends his boundaries to cross over this land is unimportant and irrelevant, for boundaries are an invisible thing, a mark on a map and not on the land. They are an extension of ego, a claim to power, a means to wealth. Yet that ego is a lie, that power more a trap than a freedom, and that wealth a facade. A facade, yes, Uncle Mather, and nothing more valuable than a way for one man to feel superior to another. Avelyn once told me a tale of a tower on the outskirts of Ursal. The place served as a prison for those who spoke ill of the King, and, usually, the door would open for such a pitiful man in only one direction. Decades after this place was built, another prison was constructed, and thus this tower had no more official use. The King, in a generous gesture, awarded the structure to an enterprising Duke. For many years, the man knew not what to do with the structure, for though it was comfortable enough, now that it had been cleaned of all implements of torture and all shackles, it was too far from the grounds of Ursal Castle, where the Duke liked to court the ladies. But he was an enterprising man, Uncle Mather, and so, when among the nobles of Ursal, he spoke often of the \"grand views\" afforded him in his country estate. Such beauty, this Duke claimed, must remain the province of the wealthy, and, since he could not spend enough time at his tower to see to its upkeep, he would offer a lease, and at the enormous, even outrageous, price of five hundred gol\u0027 bears a season. The price alone brought many curious nobles out to see the tower, and whenever they gathered the Duke was crafty in keeping the conversation about the views. The views! He played on their vanity, and the expense itself became a reason for purchase. To hear Avelyn speak of it, the argument over who would lease the tower flowered into bloody duels - and nearly into a minor war between three separate provinces. Ladies begged their noble husbands for residence in the tower; single courtiers desired the place that they might entice desirable ladies to come and experience the view. In the end, the Queen of Honce-the-Bear demanded of her husband that he take back the tower; but the King, being a man of honor, would not go back on his word to the Duke. Instead, the King rented the tower for a mere one thousand gol\u0027 bears a season. And thus the Queen got her desired view, the same view that had been, for decades, afforded enemies of the crown for free. What is wealth, Uncle Mather, but a matter of perception? And the burning need to be better than others is nothing more than a weakness in one\u0027s self. And the King is trapped, I say, in the formalities of his office, by the dangers of the envy of his inferiors, and by the very real possibility of attempted revenge by his enemies. I will keep my freedom, Uncle Mather, and my love, Jilseponie, and we will carry our home with us, wherever we choose to go and be wealthier by far in matters of the heart and the spirit. And those two treasures, in the greatest measure, are all that truly matter.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-apostle-the-demonwars-saga-3/page-22.html","bookId":2169,"book":{"id":2169,"title":"The Demon Apostle (The DemonWars Saga #3)","description":"Storyline: The Demon Apostle (The DemonWars Saga #3) With the demon dactyl and its foul minions defeated, the war-weary citizens of the kingdom of Honce-the-Bear wish only to begin rebuilding their broken lives.
