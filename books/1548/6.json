{"id":107357,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The skull lifted and the hard bulging brown eyes looked straight down the table into the eyes of General Vozdvishensky. General Vozdvishensky managed to look back calmly and even with a hint of appraisal.\n That is a deep one, thought General G. Let us put the spotlight on him and see how he shows up on the sound-track.\n \u0027Comrades,\u0027 gold flashed from both corners of his mouth as he stretched his lips in a chairman\u0027s smile, \u0027let us not be too dismayed. Even the highest tree has an axe waiting at its foot. We have never thought that our departments were so successful as to be beyond criticism. What I have been instructed to say to you will not have come as a surprise to any of us. So let us take up the challenge with a good heart and get down to business.\u0027\n Round the table there was no answering smile to these platitudes. General G. had not expected that there would be. He lit a cigarette and continued. \u0027I said that we have at once to recommend an act of terrorism in the intelligence field, and one of our departments–no doubt my own–will be called upon to carry out this act.\u0027\n An inaudible sigh of relief went round the table. So at least SMERSH would be the responsible department! That was something.\n \u0027But the choice of a target will not be an easy matter, and our collective responsibility for the correct choice will be a heavy one.\u0027\n Soft-hard, hard-soft. The ball was now back with the conference. \u0027It is not just a question of blowing up a building or shooting a prime minister. Such bourgeois horseplay is not contemplated. Our operation must be delicate, refined and aimed at the heart of the Intelligence apparat of the West. It must do grave damage to the enemy apparat–hidden damage which the public will hear perhaps nothing of, but which will be the secret talk of government circles. But it must also cause a public scandal so devastating that the world will lick its lips and sneer at the shame and stupidity of our enemies. Naturally Governments will know that it is a Soviet konspiratsia. That is good. It will be a piece of \u0027\u0027hard\u0027\u0027 policy. And the agents and spies of the West will know it, too, and they will marvel at our cleverness and they will tremble. Traitors and possible defectors will change their minds. Our own operatives will be stimulated. They will be encouraged to greater efforts by our display of strength and genius. But of course we shall deny any knowledge of the deed, whatever it may be, and it is desirable that the common people of the Soviet Union should remain in complete ignorance of our complicity.\u0027\n General G. paused and looked down the table at the representative of R.U.M.I.D., who again held his gaze impassively.\n \u0027And now to choose the organization at which we will strike, and then to decide on the specific target within that organization. Comrade Lieutenant-General Vozdvishensky, since you observe the foreign intelligence scene from a neutral standpoint [this was a jibe at the notorious jealousies that exist between the military intelligence of the G.R.U. and the Secret Service of the M.G.B., perhaps you would survey the field for us. We wish to have your opinion of the relative importance of the Western Intelligence Services. We will then choose the one which is the most dangerous and which we would most wish to damage.\u0027\n General G. sat back in his tall chair. He rested his elbows on the arms and supported his chin on the interlaced fingers of his joined hands, like a teacher preparing to listen to a long construe.\n General Vozdvishensky was not dismayed by his task. He had been in intelligence, mostly abroad, for thirty years. He had served as a \u0027doorman\u0027 at the Soviet Embassy in London under Litvinoff. He had worked with the Tass Agency in New York and had then gone back to London, to Amtorg, the Soviet Trade Organization. For five years he had been Military Attaché under the brilliant Madame Kollontai in the Stockholm Embassy. He had helped train Sorge, the Soviet master spy, before Sorge went to Tokyo. During the war, he had been for a while resident Director in Switzerland, or \u0027Schmidtland\u0027, as it had been known in the spy-jargon, and there he had helped sow the seeds of the sensationally successful but tragically misused \u0027Lucy\u0027 network. He had even gone several times into Germany as a courier to the \u0027Rote Kapelle\u0027, and had narrowly escaped being cleaned up with it. And after the war, on transfer to the Foreign Ministry, he had been on the inside of the Burgess and Maclean operation and on countless other plots to penetrate the Foreign Ministries of the West. He was a professional spy to his finger-tips and he was perfectly prepared to put on record his opinions of the rivals with whom he had been crossing swords all his life.\n The A.D.C. at his side was less comfortable. He was nervous at R.U.M.I.D. being pinned down in this way, and without a full departmental briefing. He scoured his brain clear and sharpened his ears to catch every word.\n \u0027In this matter,\u0027 said General Vozdvishensky carefully, \u0027one must not confuse the man with the office. Every country has good spies and it is not always the biggest countries that have the most or the best. But Secret Services are expensive, and small countries cannot afford the co-ordinated effort which produces good intelligence–the forgery departments, the radio network, the record department, the digestive apparatus that evaluates and compares the reports of the agents. There are individual agents serving Norway, Holland, Belgium and even Portugal who could be a great nuisance to us if these countries knew the value of their reports or made good use of them. But they do not. Instead of passing their information on to the larger powers, they prefer to sit on it and feel important. So we need not worry with these smaller countries,\u0027 he paused, \u0027until we come to Sweden. There they have been spying on us for centuries. They have always had better information on the Baltic than even Finland or Germany. They are dangerous. I would like to put a stop to their activities.\u0027\n General G. interrupted. \u0027Comrade, they are always having spy scandals in Sweden. One more scandal would not make the world look up. Please continue.\u0027\n \u0027Italy can be dismissed,\u0027 went on General Vozdvishensky, without appearing to notice the interruption. \u0027They are clever and active, but they do us no harm. They are only interested in their own backyard, the Mediterranean. The same can be said of Spain, except that their counter-intelligence is a great hindrance to the Party. We have lost many good men to these Fascists. But to mount an operation against them would probably cost us more men. And little would be achieved. They are not yet ripe for revolution. In France, while we have penetrated most of their Services, the Deuxième Bureau is still clever and dangerous. There is a man called Mathis at the head of it. A Mendès-France appointment. He would be a tempting target and it would be easy to operate in France.\u0027\n \u0027France is looking after herself,\u0027 commented General G.\n \u0027England is another matter altogether. I think we all have respect for her Intelligence Service,\u0027 General Vozdvishensky looked round the table. There were grudging nods from everyone present, including General G. \u0027Their Security Service is excellent. England, being an island, has great security advantages and their so-called M.I.5 employs men with good education and good brains. Their Secret Service is still better. They have notable successes. In certain types of operation, we are constantly finding that they have been there before us. Their agents are good. They pay them little money–only a thousand or two thousand roubles a month–but they serve with devotion. Yet these agents have no special privileges in England, no relief from taxation and no special shops such as we have, from which they can buy cheap goods. Their social standing abroad is not high, and their wives have to pass as the wives of secretaries. They are rarely awarded a decoration until they retire. And yet these men and women continue to do this dangerous work. It is curious. It is perhaps the Public School and University tradition. The love of adventure. But still it is odd that they play this game so well, for they are not natural conspirators.\u0027 General Vozdvishensky felt that his remarks might be taken as too laudatory. He hastily qualified them. \u0027Of course, most of their strength lies in the myth–in the myth of Scotland Yard, of Sherlock Holmes, of the Secret Service. We certainly have nothing to fear from these gentlemen. But this myth is a hindrance which it would be good to set aside.\u0027\n \u0027And the Americans?\u0027 General G. wanted to put a stop to Vozdvishensky\u0027s attempts to qualify his praise of British Intelligence. One day that bit about the Public School and University tradition would sound well in court. Next, hoped General G., he will be saying that the Pentagon is stronger than the Kremlin.\n \u0027The Americans have the biggest and richest service among our enemies. Technically, in such matters as radio and weapons and equipment, they are the best. But they have no understanding for the work. They get enthusiastic about some Balkan spy who says he has a secret army in the Ukraine. They load him with money with which to buy boots for this army. Of course he goes at once to Paris and spends the money on women. Americans try to do everything with money. Good spies will not work for money alone–only bad ones, of which the Americans have several divisions.\u0027\n \u0027They have successes, Comrade,\u0027 said General G. silkily. \u0027Perhaps you underestimate them.\u0027\n General Vozdvishensky shrugged. \u0027They must have successes, Comrade General. You cannot sow a million seeds without reaping one potato. Personally I do not think the Americans need engage the attention of this conference.\u0027 The head of R.U.M.I.D. sat back in his chair and stolidly took out his cigarette case.\n \u0027A very interesting exposition,\u0027 said General G. coldly. \u0027Comrade General Slavin?\u0027\n General Slavin of the G.R.U. had no intention of committing himself on behalf of the General Staff of the Army. \u0027I have listened with interest to the words of Comrade General Vozdvishensky. I have nothing to add.\u0027\n Colonel of State Security Nikitin of M.G.B. felt it would do no great harm to show up the G.R.U. as being too stupid to have any ideas at all, and at the same time to make a modest recommendation that would probably tally with the inner thoughts of those present–and that was certainly on the tip of General G.\u0027s tongue. Colonel Nikitin also knew that, given the proposition that had been posed by the Praesidium, the Soviet Secret Service would back him up.\n \u0027I recommend the English Secret Service as the object of terrorist action,\u0027 he said decisively. \u0027The devil knows my department hardly finds them a worthy adversary, but they are the best of an indifferent lot.\u0027\n General G. was annoyed by the authority in the man\u0027s voice, and by having his thunder stolen, for he also had intended to sum up in favour of an operation against the British. He tapped his lighter softly on the desk to reimpose his chairmanship. \u0027Is it agreed then, Comrades? An act of terrorism against the British Secret Service?\u0027\n There were careful, slow nods all round the table. \u0027\n \u0027I agree. And now for the target within that organization. I remember Comrade General Vozdvishensky saying something about a myth upon which much of the alleged strength of this Secret Service depends. How can we help to destroy the myth and thus strike at the very motive force of this organization? Where does this myth reside? We cannot destroy all its personnel at one blow. Does it reside in the Head? Who is the Head of the British Secret Service?\u0027\n Colonel Nikitin\u0027s aide whispered in his ear. Colonel Nikitin decided that this was a question he could and perhaps should answer.\n \u0027He is an Admiral. He is known by the letter M. We have a zapiska on him, but it contains little. He does not drink very much. He is too old for women. The public does not know of his existence. It would be difficult to create a scandal round his death. And he would not be easy to kill. He rarely goes abroad. To shoot him in a London street would not be very refined.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-6.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
