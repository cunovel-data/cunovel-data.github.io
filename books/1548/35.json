The brown toecaps shifted. Bond watched the shoe-leather strain as Nash stood up. In a minute, with Bond\u0027s gun in his right hand, Nash would climb on to the bottom bunk and reach up and feel through the curtain of hair for the base of the girl\u0027s neck. Then the snout of the Beretta would nuzzle in after the probing fingers. Nash would press the trigger. The roar of the train would cover the muffled boom.\n It would be a near thing. Bond desperately tried to remember simple anatomy. Where were the mortal places in the lower body of a man? Where did the main artery run? The Femoral. Down the inside of the thigh. And the External Iliac, or whatever it was called, that became the Femoral?\n Across the centre of the groin. If he missed both, it would be bad. Bond had no illusions about being able to beat this terrific man in unarmed combat.\n The first violent stab of his knife had to be decisive.\n The brown toecaps moved. They pointed towards the bunk. What was the man doing? There was no sound except the hollow iron clang as the great train tore through the Simplon–through the heart of the Wasenhorn and Monte Leone. The toothglass tinkled. The woodwork creaked comfortably. For a hundred yards on both sides of the little death cell rows of people were sleeping, or lying awake, thinking of their lives and loves, making little plans, wondering who would meet them at the Gare de Lyon. And, all the while, just along the corridor, death was riding with them down the same dark hole, behind the same great Diesel, on the same hot rails.\n One brown shoe left the floor. It would have stepped half across Bond. The vulnerable arch would be open above Bond\u0027s head.\n Bond\u0027s muscles coiled like a snake\u0027s. His right hand flickered a few centimetres to the hard stitching on the edge of the case. Pressed sideways. Felt the narrow shaft of the knife. Drew it softly half way out without moving his arm.\n The brown heel lifted off the ground. The toe bent and took the weight. Now the second foot had gone.\n Softly move the weight here, take the purchase there, grasp the knife hard so that it wouldn\u0027t turn on a bone, and then. . . .\n In one violent corkscrew of motion, Bond\u0027s body twisted up from the floor. The knife flashed.\n The fist with the long steel finger, and all Bond\u0027s arm and shoulder behind it, lunged upwards. Bond\u0027s knuckles felt flannel. He held the knife in, forcing it further.\n A ghastly wailing cry came down to him. The Beretta clattered to the floor. Then the knife was wrenched from Bond\u0027s hand as the man gave a convulsive twist and crashed down.\n Bond had planned for the fall, but, as he sidestepped towards the window, a flailing hand caught him and sent him thudding on to the lower bunk. Before he could recover himself, up from the floor rose the terrible face, its eyes shining violet, the violet teeth bared. Slowly, agonizingly, the two huge hands groped for him.\n Bond, half on his back, kicked out blindly. His shoe connected; but then his foot was held and twisted and he felt himself slipping downwards.\n Bond\u0027s fingers scrabbled for a hold in the stuff of the bunk. Now the other hand had him by the thigh. Nails dug into him.\n Bond\u0027s body was being twisted and pulled down. Soon the teeth would be at him. Bond hammered out with his free leg. It made no difference. He was going.\n Suddenly Bond\u0027s scrabbling fingers felt something hard. The book! How did one work the thing? Which way up was it? Would it shoot him or Nash? Desperately Bond held it out towards the great sweating face. He pressed at the base of the cloth spine.\n \u0027Click!\u0027 Bond felt the recoil. \u0027Click-click-click-click.\u0027 Now Bond felt the heat under his fingers. The hands on his legs were going limp. The glistening face was drawing back. A noise came from the throat, a terrible gurgling\n noise. Then, with a slither and a crack, the body fell forward on to the floor and the head crashed back against the woodwork.\n Bond lay and panted through clenched teeth. He stared up at the violet light above the door. He noticed that the loop of the filament waxed and waned. It crossed his mind that the dynamo under the carriage must be defective. He blinked his eyes to focus the light more closely. The sweat ran into them and stung. He lay still, doing nothing about it.\n The galloping boom of the train began to change. It sounded hollower. With a final echoing roar, the Orient Express sped out into the moonlight and slackened speed.\n Bond lazily reached up and pulled at the edge of the blind. He saw warehouses and sidings. Lights shone brightly, cleanly on the rails. Good, powerful lights. The lights of Switzerland.\n The train slid quietly to a stop.\n In a steady, singing silence, a small noise came from the floor. Bond cursed himself for not having made certain. He quickly bent down, listening. He held the book forward at the ready, just in case. No movement. Bond reached and felt for the jugular vein. No pulse. The man was quite dead. The corpse had been settling.\n Bond sat back and waited impatiently for the train to move again. There was a lot to be done. Even before he could see to Tatiana, there would have to be the cleaning up.\n With a jerk the long express started softly rolling. Soon the train would be slaloming fast down through the foothills of the Alps into the Canton Valais. Already there was a new sound in the wheels–a hurrying lilt, as if they were glad the tunnel was past.\n Bond got to his feet and stepped over the sprawling legs of the dead man and turned on the top light.\n What a shambles! The place looked like a butcher\u0027s shop. How much blood did the body contain? He remembered. Ten pints. Well, it would soon all be there. As long as it didn\u0027t spread into the passage! Bond stripped the bedclothes off the bottom bunk and set to work.\n At last the job was done–the walls swabbed down around the covered bulk on the floor, the suitcases piled ready for the getaway at Dijon.\n Bond drank down a whole carafe of water. Then he stepped up and gently shook the shoulder of fur.\n There was no response. Had the man lied? Had he killed her with the poison?\n Bond thrust his hand in against her neck. It was warm. Bond felt for the lobe of an ear and pinched it hard. The girl stirred sluggishly and moaned. Again Bond pinched the ear, and again. At last a muffled voice said, \u0027Don\u0027t.\u0027\n Bond smiled. He shook her. He went on shaking until Tatiana slowly turned over on her side. Two doped blue eyes gazed into his and closed again. \u0027What is it?\u0027 The voice was sleepily angry.\n Bond talked to her and bullied her and cursed her. He shook her more roughly. At last she sat up. She gazed vacantly at him. Bond pulled her legs out so that they hung down over the edge. Somehow he manhandled her down on to the bottom bunk.\n Tatiana looked terrible–the slack mouth, the upturned, sleep-drunk eyes, the tangle of damp hair. Bond got to work with a wet towel and her comb.\n Lausanne came and, an hour later, the French frontier at Vallorbes. Bond left Tatiana and went out and stood in the corridor, just in case. But the customs and passport men brushed past him to the conductor\u0027s cabin, and after five inscrutable minutes, went on down the train.\n Bond stepped back into the compartment. Tatiana was asleep again. Bond looked at Nash\u0027s watch, which was now on his own wrist. 4.30. Another hour to Dijon. Bond set to work.\n At last Tatiana\u0027s eyes opened wide. Her pupils were more or less centred. She said, \u0027Stop it now, James.\u0027 She closed her eyes again. Bond wiped the sweat off his face. He took the bags, one by one, to the end of the corridor and piled them against the exit. Then he went along to the conductor and told him that Madame was not well and that they would be leaving the train at Dijon.\n Bond gave the conductor a final tip. \u0027Do not derange yourself,\u0027 he said. \u0027I have taken the luggage out so as not to disturb Madame. My friend, the one with fair hair, is a doctor. He has been sitting up with us all night. I have put him to sleep in my bunk. The man was exhausted. It would be kind not to waken him until ten minutes before Paris.\u0027\n \u0027Certainement, Monsieur\u0027 The conductor had not been showered with money like this since the good days of travelling millionaires. He handed over Bond\u0027s passport and tickets. The train began to slacken speed. \u0027Voilà que nous y sommes.\u0027\n Bond went back to the compartment. He dragged Tatiana to her feet and out into the corridor and shut the door on the white pile of death beside the bunk.\n At last they were down the steps and on to the hard, wonderful, motionless platform. A blue-smocked porter took their luggage.\n The sun was beginning to rise. At that hour of the morning there were very few passengers awake. Only a handful in the third class, who had ridden \u0027hard\u0027 through the night, saw a young man help a young girl away from the dusty carriage with the romantic names on its side towards the drab door that said \u0027SORTIE\u0027.\n Chapter Twenty-Eight\n La Tricoteuse\n The taxi drew up at the Rue Cambon entrance to the Ritz Hotel.\n Bond looked at Nash\u0027s watch. 11.45. He must be dead punctual. He knew that if a Russian spy was even a few minutes early or late for a rendezvous the rendezvous was automatically cancelled. He paid off the taxi and went through the door on the left that leads into the Ritz bar.\n Bond ordered a double vodka martini. He drank it half down. He felt wonderful. Suddenly the last four days, and particularly last night, were washed off the calendar. Now he was on his own, having his private adventure. All his duties had been taken care of. The girl was sleeping in a bedroom at the Embassy. The Spektor, still pregnant with explosive, had been taken away by the bomb-disposal squad of the Deuxième Bureau. He had spoken to his old friend René Mathis, now head of the Deuxième, and the concierge at the Cambon entrance to the Ritz had been told to give him a pass-key and to ask no questions.\n René had been delighted to find himself again involved with Bond in une affaire noire. \u0027Have confidence, cher James,\u0027 he had said. \u0027I will execute your mysteries. You can tell me the story afterwards. Two laundry-men with a large laundry basket will come to Room 204 at 12.15. I shall accompany them dressed as the driver of their camion. We are to fill the laundry basket and take it to Orly and await an R.A.F. Canberra which will arrive at two o\u0027clock. We hand over the basket. Some dirty washing which was in France will be in England. Yes?\u0027\n Head of Station F had spoken to M on the scrambler. He had passed over a short written report from Bond. He had asked for the Canberra. No, he had no idea what it was for. Bond had only shown up to deliver the girl and the Spektor. He had eaten a huge breakfast and had left the Embassy saying he would be back after lunch.\n Bond looked again at the time. He finished his martini. He paid for it and walked out of the bar and up the steps to the concierge\u0027s lodge.\n The concierge looked sharply at him and handed over a key. Bond walked over to the lift and got in and went up to the third floor.\n The lift door clanged behind him. Bond walked softly down the corridor, looking at the numbers.\n 204. Bond put his right hand inside his coat and on to the taped butt of the Beretta. It was tucked into the waistband of his trousers. He could feel the metal of the silencer warm across his stomach.\n He knocked once with his left hand.\n \u0027Come in.\u0027\n It was a quavering voice. An old woman\u0027s voice.\n Bond tried the handle of the door. It was unlocked. He slipped the passkey into his coat-pocket. He pushed the door open with one swift motion and stepped in and shut it behind him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-35.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
