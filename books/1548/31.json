{"id":107381,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\u0027What are your ideas? Would you and your wife like to take another way home?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d rather you decided, sir. My wife\u0027s all right. The sample\u0027s in good condition. I don\u0027t see why it should deteriorate. I\u0027m still keen to finish the trip. Otherwise it\u0027ll remain virgin territory. We shan\u0027t know what the possibilities are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would you like one of our other salesmen to give you a hand?\u0027 \u0027It shouldn\u0027t be necessary, sir. Just as you feel.\u0027\\n\\n Til think about it. So you really want to see this sales campaign through?\u0027 Bond could see M\u0027s eyes glittering with the same perverse curiosity, the same rage to know, as he himself felt. \u0027Yes, sir. Now that I\u0027m half way, it seems a pity not to cover the whole route.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right then. I\u0027ll think about giving you another salesman to lend a hand.\u0027 There was a pause on the end of the line. \u0027Nothing else on your mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, sir.\u0027\\n\\n Bond put down the receiver. He sat and looked at it. He suddenly wished he had agreed with M\u0027s suggestion to give him reinforcements, just in case. He got up from the bed. At least they would soon be out of these damn Balkans and down into Italy. Then Switzerland, France–among friendly people, away from the furtive lands.\\n\\n And the girl, what about her? Could he blame her for the death of Kerim? Bond went into the next room and stood again by the window, looking out, wondering, going back over everything, every expression and every gesture she had made since he had first heard her voice on that night in the Kristal Palas. No, he knew he couldn\u0027t put the blame on her. If she was an agent, she was an unconscious agent. There wasn\u0027t a girl of her age in the world who could have played this role, if it was a role she was playing, without betraying herself. And he liked her. And he had faith in his instincts. Besides, with the death of Kerim, had not the plot, whatever it was, played itself out? One day he would find out what the plot had been. For the moment he was certain. Tatiana was not a conscious part of it.\\n\\n His mind made up, Bond walked over to the bathroom door and knocked. She came out and he took her in his arms and held her to him and kissed her. She clung to him. They stood and felt the animal warmth come back between them, feeling it push back the cold memory of Kerim\u0027s death.\\n\\n Tatiana broke away. She looked up at Bond\u0027s face. She reached up and brushed the black comma of hair away from his forehead.\\n\\n Her face was alive. \u0027I am glad you have come back, James,\u0027 she said. And then, matter-of-factly, \u0027And now we must eat and drink and start our lives again.\u0027\\n\\n Later, after Slivovic and smoked ham and peaches, Tempo came and took them to the station and to the waiting express under the hard lights of the arcs. He said goodbye, quickly and coldly, and vanished down the platform and back into his dark existence.\\n\\n Punctually at nine the new engine gave its new kind of noise and took the long train out on its all-night run down the valley of the Sava. Bond went along to the conductor\u0027s cabin to give him money and look through the passports of the new passengers.\\n\\n Bond knew most of the signs to look for in forged passports, the blurred writing, the too exact imprints of the rubber stamps, the trace of old gum round the edges of the photograph, the slight transparencies on the pages where the fibres of the paper had been tampered with to alter a letter or a number, but the five new passports–three American and two Swiss–seemed innocent. The Swiss papers, favourites with the Russian forgers, belonged to a husband and wife, both over seventy, and Bond finally passed them and went back to the compartment and prepared for another night with Tatiana\u0027s head on his lap.\\n\\n Vincovci came and then, against a flaming dawn, the ugly sprawl of Zagreb. The train came to a stop between lines of rusting locomotives captured from the Germans and still standing forlornly amongst the grass and weeds on the sidings. Bond read the plate on one of them–BERLINER MASCHINENBAU GMBH–as they slid out through the iron cemetery. Its long black barrel had been raked with machine gun bullets. Bond heard the scream of the dive-bomber and saw the upflung arms of the driver. For a moment he thought nostalgically and unreasonably of the excitement and turmoil of the hot war, compared with his own underground skirmishings since the war had turned cold.\\n\\n They hammered into the mountains of Slovenia where the apple trees and the chalets were almost Austrian. The train laboured its way through Ljubliana. The girl awoke. They had breakfast of fried eggs and hard brown bread and coffee that was mostly chicory. The restaurant car was full of cheerful English and American tourists from the Adriatic coast, and Bond thought with a lift of the heart that by the afternoon they would be over the frontier into western Europe and that a third dangerous night was gone.\\n\\n He slept until Sezana. The hard-faced Yugoslav plain-clothes men came on board. Then Yugoslavia was gone and Poggioreale came and the first smell of the soft life with the happy jabbering of Italian officials and the carefree upturned faces of the station crowd. The new diesel-electric engine gave a slap-happy whistle, the meadow of brown hands fluttered, and they were loping easily down into Venezia, towards the distant sparkle of Trieste and the gay blue of the Adriatic.\\n\\n We\u0027ve made it, thought Bond. I really think we\u0027ve made it. He thrust the memory of the last three days away from him. Tatiana saw the tense lines in his face relax. She reached over and took his hand. He moved and sat close beside her. They looked out at the gay villas on the Corniche and at the sailing-boats and the people water-skiing.\\n\\n The train clanged across some points and slid quietly into the gleaming station of Trieste. Bond got up and pulled down the window and they stood side by side, looking out. Suddenly Bond felt happy. He put an arm around the girl\u0027s waist and held her hard against him.\\n\\n They gazed down at the holiday crowd. The sun shone through the tall clean windows of the station in golden shafts. The sparkling scene emphasized the dark and dirt of the countries the train had come from, and Bond watched with an almost sensuous pleasure the gaily dressed people pass through the patches of sunshine towards the entrance, and the sunburned people, the ones who had had their holidays, hasten up the platform to get their seats on the train.\\n\\n A shaft of sun lit up the head of one man who seemed typical of this happy, playtime world. The light flashed briefly on golden hair under a cap, and on a young golden moustache. There was plenty of time to catch the train. The man walked unhurriedly. It crossed Bond\u0027s mind that he was an Englishman. Perhaps it was the familiar shape of the dark green Kangol cap, or the beige, rather well-used macintosh, that badge of the English tourist, or it may have been the grey-flannelled legs, or the scuffed brown shoes. But Bond\u0027s eyes were drawn to him, as if it was someone he knew, as the man approached up the platform.\\n\\n The man was carrying a battered Revelation suitcase and, under the other arm, a thick book and some newspapers. He looks like an athlete, thought Bond. He has the wide shoulders and the healthy, good-looking bronzed face of a professional tennis player going home after a round of foreign tournaments.\\n\\n The man came nearer. Now he was looking straight at Bond. With recognition? Bond searched his mind. Did he know this man? No. He would have remembered those eyes that stared out so coldly under the pale lashes. They were opaque, almost dead. The eyes of a drowned man. But they had some message for him. What was it? Recognition? Warning? Or just the defensive reaction of Bond\u0027s own stare?\\n\\n The man came up with the wagon-lit. His eyes were now gazing levelly up the train. He walked past, the crêpe-soled shoes making no sound. Bond watched him reach for the rail and swing himself easily up the steps into the first-class carriage.\\n\\n Suddenly Bond knew what the glance had meant, who the man was. Of course! This man was from the Service. After all M had decided to send along an extra hand. That was the message of those queer eyes. Bond would bet anything that the man would soon be along to make contact.\\n\\n How like M to make absolutely sure!\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Five\\n\\n A Tie with a Windsor Knot\\n\\n To make the contact easy, Bond went out and stood in the corridor. He ran over the details of the code of the day, the few harmless phrases, changed on the first of each month, that served as a simple recognition signal between English agents.\\n\\n The train gave a jerk and moved slowly out into the sunshine. At the end of the corridor the communicating door slammed. There was no sound of steps, but suddenly the red and gold face was mirrored in the window.\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me. Could I borrow a match?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I use a lighter.\u0027 Bond produced his battered Ronson and handed it over.\\n\\n \u0027Better still.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Until they go wrong.\u0027\\n\\n Bond looked up into the man\u0027s face, expecting a smile at the completion of the childish \u0027Who goes there? Pass, Friend\u0027 ritual.\\n\\n The thick lips writhed briefly. There was no light in the very pale blue eyes.\\n\\n The man had taken off his macintosh. He was wearing an old reddish-brown tweed coat with his flannel trousers, a pale yellow Viyella summer shirt, and the dark blue and maroon zig-zagged tie of the Royal Artillery. It was tied with a Windsor knot. Bond mistrusted anyone who tied his tie with a Windsor knot. It showed too much vanity. It was often the mark of a cad. Bond decided to forget his prejudice. A gold signet ring, with an indecipherable crest, glinted on the little finger of the right hand that gripped the guard rail. The corner of a red bandana handkerchief flopped out of the breast pocket of the man\u0027s coat. On his left wrist there was a battered silver wrist watch with an old leather strap.\\n\\n Bond knew the type–a minor public school and then caught up by the war. Field Security perhaps. No idea what to do afterwards so he stayed with the occupation troops. At first he would have been with the military police, then, as the senior men drifted home, there came promotion into one of the security services. Moved to Trieste where he did well enough. Wanted to stay on and avoid the rigours of England. Probably had a girl friend, or had married an Italian. The Secret Service had needed a man for the small post that Trieste had become after the withdrawal. This man was available. They took him on. He would be doing routine jobs–have some low-grade sources in the Italian and Yugoslav police, and in their intelligence networks. A thousand a year. A good life, without much being expected from him.\\n\\n Then, out of the blue, this had come along. Must have been a shock getting one of those Most Immediate signals. He\u0027d probably be a bit shy of Bond. Odd face. The eyes looked rather mad. But so they did in most of these men doing secret work abroad. One had to be a bit mad to take it on. Powerful chap, probably on the stupid side, but useful for this kind of guard work. M had just taken the nearest man and told him to join the train.\\n\\n All this went through Bond\u0027s mind as he photographed an impression of the man\u0027s clothes and general appearance. Now he said, \u0027Glad to see you. How did it happen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Got a signal. Late last night. Personal from M. Shook me I can tell you, old man.\u0027\\n\\n Curious accent. What was it? A hint of brogue–cheap brogue. And something else Bond couldn\u0027t define. Probably came from living too long abroad and talking foreign languages all the time. And that dreadful \u0027old man\u0027 at the end. Shyness.\\n\\n \u0027Must have,\u0027 said Bond sympathetically. \u0027What did it say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just told me to get on the Orient this morning and contact a man and a girl in the through carriage. More or less described what you look like. Then I was to stick by you and see you both through to Gay Paree. That\u0027s all, old man.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-31.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \\n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
