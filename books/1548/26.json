{"id":107376,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u0027Now you\u0027re lying.\u0027 A big tear rolled out of one wide blue eye and down the soft cheek and on to the pillow. She pulled the sheet up over her eyes.\n Bond reached out and put his hand on her arm under the sheet. The arm flinched angrily away.\n \u0027Damn the bloody machine,\u0027 he said impatiently. \u0027But for God\u0027s sake, Tania, you must know that I\u0027ve got a job to do. Just say one way or the other and we\u0027ll forget about it. There are lots more things to talk about.\n We\u0027ve got to arrange our journey and so on. Of course my people want it or they wouldn\u0027t have sent me out to bring you home with it.\u0027\n Tatiana dabbed her eyes with the sheet. Brusquely she pulled the sheet down to her shoulders again. She knew that she had been forgetting her job. It had just been that. . . Oh well. If only he had said that the machine didn\u0027t matter to him so long as she would come. But that was too much to hope for. He was right. He had a job to do. So had she.\n She looked up at him calmly. \u0027I will bring it. Have no fear. But do not let us mention it again. And now listen.\u0027 She sat up straighter on the pillows. \u0027We must go tonight.\u0027 She remembered her lesson. \u0027It is the only chance. This evening I am on duty from six o\u0027clock. I shall be alone in the office and I will take the Spektor.\u0027\n Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed. His mind raced as he thought of the problems that would have to be faced. Where to hide her. How to get her out to the first plane after the loss had been discovered. It was going to be a risky business. They would stop at nothing to get her and the Spektor back. Roadblock on the way to the airport. Bomb in the plane. Anything.\n \u0027That\u0027s wonderful, Tania.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was casual. \u0027We\u0027ll keep you hidden and then we\u0027ll take the first plane tomorrow morning.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t be foolish.\u0027 Tatiana had been warned that here would be some difficult lines in her part. \u0027We will take the train. This Orient Express. It leaves at nine tonight. Do you think I haven\u0027t been thinking this thing out? I won\u0027t stay a minute longer in Istanbul than I have to. We will be over the frontier at dawn. You must get the tickets and a passport. I will travel with you as your wife.\u0027 She looked happily up at him. \u0027I shall like that. In one of those coupes I have read about. They must be very comfortable. Like a tiny house on wheels. During the day we will talk and read and at night you will stand in the corridor outside our house and guard it.\u0027\n \u0027Like hell I will,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But look here, Tania. That\u0027s crazy. They\u0027re bound to catch up with us somewhere. It\u0027s four days and five nights to London on that train. We\u0027ve got to think of something else.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t,\u0027 said the girl flatly. \u0027That\u0027s the only way I\u0027ll go. If you are clever, how can they find out?\u0027\n Oh God, she thought. Why had they insisted on this train? But they had been definite. It was a good place for love, they had said. She would have four days to get him to love her. Then, when they got to London, life would be easy for her. He would protect her. Otherwise, if they flew to London, she would be put straight into prison. The four days were essential. And, they had warned her, we will have men on the train to see you don\u0027t get off. So be careful and obey your orders. Oh God. Oh God. Yet now she longed for those four days with him in the little house on wheels. How curious! It had been her duty to force him. Now it was her passionate desire.\n She watched Bond\u0027s thoughtful face. She longed to stretch out a hand to him and reassure him that it would be all right; that this was a harmless konspiratsia to get her to England: that no harm could come to either of them, because that was not the object of the plot.\n \u0027Well, I still think it\u0027s crazy,\u0027 said Bond, wondering what M\u0027s reaction would be. \u0027But I suppose it may work. I\u0027ve got the passport. It will need a Yugoslav visa,\u0027 he looked at her sternly. \u0027Don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to take you on the part of the train that goes through Bulgaria, or I shall think you want to kidnap me.\u0027\n \u0027I do,\u0027 Tatiana giggled. \u0027That\u0027s exactly what I want to do.\u0027\n \u0027Now shut up, Tania. We\u0027ve got to work this out. I\u0027ll get the tickets and I\u0027ll have one of our men come along. Just in case. He\u0027s a good man. You\u0027ll like him. Your name\u0027s Caroline Somerset. Don\u0027t forget it. How are you going to get to the train!\u0027\n \u0027Karolin Siomerset,\u0027 the girl turned the name over in her mind. \u0027It is a pretty name. And you are Mister Siomerset.\u0027 She laughed happily. \u0027That is fun. Do not worry about me. I will come to the train just before it leaves. It is the Sirkeci Station. I know where it is. So that is all. And we do not worry any more. Yes?\u0027\n \u0027Suppose you lose your nerve? Suppose they catch you?\u0027 Suddenly Bond was worried at the girl\u0027s confidence. How could she be so certain? A sharp tingle of suspicion ran down his spine.\n \u0027Before I saw you, I was frightened. Now I am not.\u0027 Tatiana tried to tell herself that this was the truth. Somehow it nearly was. \u0027Now I shall not lose my nerve, as you call it. And they cannot catch me. I shall leave my things in the hotel and take my usual bag to the office. I cannot leave my fur coat behind. I love it too dearly. But today is Sunday and that will be an excuse to come to the office in it. Tonight at half-past eight I shall walk out and take a taxi to the station. And now you must stop looking so worried.\u0027 Impulsively, because she had to, she stretched out a hand towards him. \u0027Say that you are pleased.\u0027\n Bond moved to the edge of the bed. He took her hand and looked down into her eyes. God, he thought. I hope it\u0027s all right. I hope this crazy plan will work. Is this wonderful girl a cheat? Is she true? Is she real? The eyes told him nothing except that the girl was happy, and that she wanted him to love her, and that she was surprised at what was happening to her. Tatiana\u0027s other hand came up and round his neck and pulled him fiercely down to her. At first the mouth trembled under his and then, as passion took her, the mouth yielded into a kiss without end.\n Bond lifted his legs on to the bed. While his mouth went on kissing her, his hand went to her left breast and held it, feeling the peak hard with desire under his fingers. His hand strayed on down across her flat stomach. Her legs shifted languidly. She moaned softly and her mouth slid away from his. Below the closed eyes the long lashes quivered like humming birds\u0027 wings.\n Bond reached up and took the edge of the sheet and pulled it right down and threw it off the end of the huge bed. She was wearing nothing but the black ribbon round her neck and black silk stockings rolled above her knees. Her arms groped up for him.\n Above them, and unknown to both of them, behind the gold-framed false mirror on the wall over the bed, the two photographers from SMERSH sat close together in the cramped cabinet de voyeur, as, before them, so many friends of the proprietor had sat on a honeymoon night in the stateroom of the Kristal Palas.\n And the view-finders gazed coldly down on the passionate arabesques the two bodies formed and broke and formed again, and the clockwork mechanism of the cine-cameras whirred softly on and on as the breath rasped out of the open mouths of the two men and the sweat of excitement trickled down their bulging faces into their cheap collars.\n Chapter Twenty-One\n Orient Express\n The great trains are going out all over Europe, one by one, but still, three times a week, the Orient Express thunders superbly over the 1 ,400 miles of glittering steel track between Istanbul and Paris.\n Under the arc-lights, the long-chassied German locomotive panted quietly with the laboured breath of a dragon dying of asthma. Each heavy breath seemed certain to be the last. Then came another. Wisps of steam rose from the couplings between the carriages and died quickly in the warm August air. The Orient Express was the only live train in the ugly, cheaply architectured burrow that is Istanbul\u0027s main station. The trains on the other lines were engineless and unattended–waiting for tomorrow. Only Track No. 3, and its platform, throbbed with the tragic poetry of departure.\n The heavy bronze cipher on the side of the dark blue coach said,\n \u0027COMPAGNIE INTERNATIONALE DES WAGON-LITS ET DES GRANDS EXPRESS EUROPEENS.\n Above the cipher, fitted into metal slots, was a flat iron sign that announced, in black capitals on white, ORIENT EXPRESS, and underneath, in three lines:\n ISTANBUL – THESSALONIKI – BEOGRAD\n VENEZIA – MILAN\n LAUSANNE – PARIS\n James Bond gazed vaguely at one of the most romantic signs in the world. For the tenth time he looked at his watch. 8.51. His eyes went back to the sign. All the towns were spelled in the language of the country except MILAN. Why not MILANO? Bond took out his handkerchief and wiped his face. Where the hell was the girl? Had she been caught? Had she had second thoughts?\n Had he been too rough with her last night, or rather this morning, in the great bed?\n 8.55. The quiet pant of the engine had stopped. There came an echoing whoosh as the automatic safety-valve let off the excess steam. A hundred yards away, through the milling crowd, Bond watched the station-master raise a hand to the engine driver and fireman and start walking slowly back down the train, banging the doors of the third-class carriages up front. Passengers, mostly peasants going back into Greece after a week-end with their relatives in Turkey, hung out of the windows and jabbered at the grinning crowd below.\n Beyond, where the faded arc-lights stopped and the dark blue night and the stars showed through the crescent mouth of the station, Bond saw a red pinpoint turn to green.\n The station-master came nearer. The brown uniformed wagon-lit attendant tapped Bond on the arm. \u0027En voiture, s\u0027il vous plait.\u0027 The two rich-looking Turks kissed their mistresses–they were too pretty to be wives–and, with a barrage of laughing injunctions, stepped on to the little iron pedestal and up the two tall steps into the carriage. There were no other wagon-lit travellers on the platform. The conductor, with an impatient glance at the tall Englishman, picked up the iron pedestal and climbed with it into the train.\n The station-master strode purposefully by. Two more compartments, the first- and second-class carriages, and then, when he reached the guard\u0027s van, he would lift the dirty green flag.\n There was no hurrying figure coming up the platform from the guichet. High up above the guichet, near the ceiling of the station, the minute hand of the big illuminated clock jumped forward an inch and said \u0027Nine\u0027.\n A window banged down above Bond\u0027s head. Bond looked up. His immediate reaction was that the black veil was too wide-meshed. The intention to disguise the luxurious mouth and the excited blue eyes was amateurish.\n \u0027Quick.\u0027\n The train had begun to move. Bond reached for the passing hand-rail and swung up on to the step. The attendant was still holding open the door. Bond stepped unhurriedly through.\n \u0027Madam was late,\u0027 said the attendant. \u0027She came along the corridor. She must have entered by the last carriage.\u0027\n Bond went down the carpeted corridor to the centre coupe. A black 7 stood above a black 8 on the white metal lozenge. The door was ajar. Bond walked in and shut it behind him. The girl had taken off her veil and her black straw hat. She was sitting in the corner by the window. A long, sleek sable coat was thrown open to show a natural coloured shantung dress with a pleated skirt, honey-coloured nylons and a black crocodile belt and shoes. She looked composed.\n \u0027You have no faith, James.\u0027\n Bond sat down beside her. \u0027Tania,\u0027 he said, \u0027if there was a bit more room I\u0027d put you across my knee and spank you. You nearly gave me heart failure. What happened?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Tatiana innocently. \u0027What could happen? I said I would be here, and I am here. You have no faith. Since I am sure you are more interested in my dowry than in me, it is up there.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-26.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
