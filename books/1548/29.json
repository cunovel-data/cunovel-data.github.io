{"id":107379,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"The engine whistled, a new kind of whistle, the brave shrill blast of a Greek engine-driver. The door of the wagon-lit carriage clanged shut. The plain-clothes man and the second policeman appeared walking over to the station. The guard at the back of the train looked at his watch and held out his flag. There was a jerk and a diminishing crescendo of explosive puffs from the engine and the front section of the Orient Express began to move. The section that would be taking the northern route through the Iron Curtain–through Svilengrad on the Bulgarian frontier, only fifty miles away–was left beside the dusty platform, waiting.\\n\\n Bond pulled down the window and took a last look back at the Turkish frontier, where two men would be sitting in a bare room under what amounted to sentence of death. Two birds down, he thought. Two out of three. The odds looked more respectable.\\n\\n He watched the dead, dusty platform, with its chickens and the small black figure of the guard, until the long train took the points and jerked harshly on to the single main line. He looked away across the ugly, parched countryside towards the golden guinea sun climbing out of the Turkish plain. It was going to be a beautiful day.\\n\\n Bond drew his head in out of the cool, sweet morning air. He pulled up the window with a bang.\\n\\n He had made up his mind. He would stay on the train and see the thing through.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Three\\n\\n Out of Greece\\n\\n Hot coffee from the meagre little buffet at Pithion (there would be no restaurant car until midday), a painless visit from the Greek customs and passport control, and then the berths were folded away as the train hurried south towards the Gulf of Enez at the head of the Aegean. Outside, there was extra light and colour. The air was drier. The men at the little stations and in the fields were handsome. Sunflowers, maize, vines and racks of tobacco were ripening in the sun. It was, as Darko had said, another day.\\n\\n Bond washed and shaved under the amused eyes of Tatiana. She approved of the fact that he put no oil on his hair. \u0027It is a dirty habit,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was told that many Europeans have it. We would not think of doing it in Russia. It dirties the pillows. But it is odd that you in the West do not use perfume. All our men do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We wash,\u0027 said Bond dryly.\\n\\n In the heat of her protests, there came a knock on the door. It was Kerim. Bond let him in. Kerim bowed towards the girl. \u0027What a charming domestic scene,\u0027 he commented cheerfully, lowering his bulk into the corner near the door. \u0027I have rarely seen a handsomer pair of spies.\u0027\\n\\n Tatiana glowered at him. \u0027I am not accustomed to Western jokes,\u0027 she said coldly.\\n\\n Kerim\u0027s laugh was disarming. \u0027You\u0027ll learn, my dear. In England, they are great people for jokes. There it is considered proper to make a joke of everything. I also have learned to make jokes. They grease the wheels. I have been laughing a lot this morning. Those poor fellows at Uzunkopru. I wish I could be there when the police telephone the German Consulate in Istanbul. That is the worst of forged passports. They are not difficult to make, but it is almost impossible to forge also their birth certificate–the files of the country which is supposed to have issued them. I fear the careers of your two comrades have come to a sad end, Mrs Somerset.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 Bond knotted his tie.\\n\\n \u0027Money and influence. Five hundred dollars to the conductor. Some big talk to the police. It was lucky our friend tried a bribe. A pity that crafty Benqd next door,\u0027 he gestured at the wall, \u0027didn\u0027t get involved. I couldn\u0027t do the passport trick twice. We will have to get him some other way. The man with the boils was easy. He knew no German and travelling without a ticket is a serious matter. Ah well, the day has started favourably. We have won the first round, but our friend next door will now be very careful. He knows what he has to reckon with. Perhaps that is for the best. It would have been a nuisance having to keep you both under cover all day. Now we can move about–even have lunch together, as long as you bring the family jewels with you. We must watch to see if he makes a telephone call at one of the stations. But I doubt if he could tackle the Greek telephone exchange. He will probably wait until we are in Yugoslavia. But there I have my machine. We can get reinforcements if we need them. It should be a most interesting journey. There is always excitement on the Orient Express,\u0027 Kerim got to his feet. He opened the door, \u0027and romance.\u0027 He smiled across the compartment. \u0027I will call for you at lunchtime! Greek food is worse than Turkish, but even my stomach is in the service of the Queen.\u0027\\n\\n Bond got up and locked the door. Tatiana snapped, \u0027Your friend is not kulturny. It is disloyal to refer to your Queen in that manner.\u0027\\n\\n Bond sat down beside her. \u0027Tania,\u0027 he said patiently, \u0027that is a wonderful man. He is also a good friend. As far as I am concerned he can say anything he likes. He is jealous of me. He would like to have a girl like you. So he teases you. It is a form of flirting. You should take it as a compliment.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think so?\u0027 she turned her large blue eyes on his. \u0027But what he said about his stomach and the head of your State. That was being rude to your Queen. It would be considered very bad manners to say such a thing in Russia.\u0027\\n\\n They were still arguing when the train ground to a halt in the sunbaked, fly-swarming station of Alexandropolis. Bond opened the door into the corridor and the sun poured in across a pale mirrored sea that married, almost without horizon, into a sky the colour of the Greek flag.\\n\\n They had lunch, with the heavy bag under the table between Bond\u0027s feet. Kerim quickly made friends with the girl. The M.G.B. man called Benz avoided the restaurant car. They saw him on the platform buying sandwiches and beer from a buffet on wheels. Kerim suggested they ask him to make a four at bridge. Bond suddenly felt very tired and his tiredness made him feel that they were turning this dangerous journey into a picnic. Tatiana noticed his silence. She got up and said that she must rest. As they went out of the wagon-restaurant they heard Kerim calling gaily for brandy and cigars.\\n\\n Back in the compartment, Tatiana said firmly, \u0027Now it is you who will sleep.\u0027 She drew down the blind and shut out the hard afternoon light and the endless baked fields of maize and tobacco and wilting sunflowers. The compartment became a dark green underground cavern. Bond wedged the doors and gave her his gun and stretched out with his head in her lap and was immediately asleep.\\n\\n The long train snaked along the north of Greece below the foothills of the Rhodope Mountains. Xanthi came, and Drama, and Serrai, and then they were in the Macedonian highlands and the line swerved due south towards Salonica.\\n\\n It was dark when Bond awoke in the soft cradle of her lap. At once, as if she had been waiting for the moment, Tatiana took his face between her hands and looked down into his eyes and said urgently, \u0027Duschka, how long shall we have this for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For long.\u0027 Bond\u0027s thoughts were still luxurious with sleep.\\n\\n \u0027But for how long?\u0027\\n\\n Bond gazed up into the beautiful, worried eyes. He cleared the sleep out of his mind. It was impossible to see beyond the next three days on the train, beyond their arrival in London. One had to face the fact that this girl was an enemy agent. His feelings would be of no interest to the interrogators from his Service and from the Ministries. Other intelligence services would also want to know what this girl had to tell them about the machine she had worked for. Probably at Dover she would be taken away to \u0027The Cage\u0027, that well-sentried private house near Guildford, where she would be put in a comfortable, but oh so well-wired room. And the efficient men in plain clothes would come one by one and sit and talk with her, and the recorder would spin in the room below and the records would be transcribed and sifted for their grains of new fact–and, of course, for the contradictions they would trap her into. Perhaps they would introduce a stool-pigeon–a nice Russian girl who would commiserate with Tatiana over her treatment and suggest ways of escape, of turning double, of getting \u0027harmless\u0027 information back to her parents. This might go on for weeks or months. Meanwhile Bond would be tactfully kept away from her, unless the interrogators thought he could extract further secrets by using their feelings for each other. Then what? The changed name, the offer of a new life in Canada, the thousand pounds a year she would be given from the secret funds? And where would he be when she came out of it all? Perhaps the other side of the world. Or, if he was still in London, how much of her feeling for him would have survived the grinding of the interrogation machine? How much would she hate or despise the English after going through all this? And, for the matter of that, how much would have survived of his own hot flame?\\n\\n \u0027Duschka,\u0027 repeated Tatiana impatiently. \u0027How long?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As long as possible. It will depend on us. Many people will interfere. We shall be separated. It will not always be like this in a little room. In a few days we shall have to step out into the world. It will not be easy. It would be foolish to tell you anything else.\u0027\\n\\n Tatiana\u0027s face cleared. She smiled down at him. \u0027You are right. I will not ask any more foolish questions. But we must waste no more of these days.\u0027 She shifted his head and got up and lay down beside him.\\n\\n An hour later, when Bond was standing in the corridor, Darko Kerim was suddenly beside him. He examined Bond\u0027s face. He said slyly, \u0027You should not sleep so long. You have been missing the historic landscape of northern Greece. And it is time for the premier service.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All you think about is food,\u0027 said Bond. He gestured back with his head. \u0027What about our friend?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He has not stirred. The conductor has been watching for me. That man will end up the richest conductor in the wagon-lit company. Five hundred dollars for Goldfarb\u0027s papers, and now a hundred dollars a day retainer until the end of the journey.\u0027 Kerim chuckled. \u0027I have told him he may even get a medal for his services to Turkey. He believes we are after a smuggling gang. They\u0027re always using this train for running Turkish opium to Paris. He is not surprised, only pleased that he is being paid so well. And now, have you found out anything more from this Russian princess you have in there? I still feel disquiet. Everything is too peaceful. Those two men we left behind may have been quite innocently bound for Berlin as the girl says. This Benz may be keeping to his room because he is frightened of us. All is going well with our journey. And yet, and yet ... Kerim shook his head. \u0027These Russians are great chess players. When they wish to execute a plot, they execute it brilliantly. The game is planned minutely, the gambits of the enemy are provided for. They are foreseen and countered. At the back of my mind,\u0027 Kerim\u0027s face in the window was gloomy, \u0027I have a feeling that you and I and this girl are pawns on a very big board–that we are being allowed our moves because they do not interfere with the Russian game.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what is the object of the plot?\u0027 Bond looked out into the darkness. He spoke to his reflection in the window. \u0027What can they want to achieve? We always get back to that. Of course we have all smelt a conspiracy of some sort. And the girl may not even know that she\u0027s involved in it. I know she\u0027s hiding something, but I think it\u0027s only some small secret she thinks is unimportant. She says she\u0027ll tell me everything when we get to London. Everything? What does she mean? She only says that I must have faith–that there is no danger. You must admit, Darko,\u0027 Bond looked up for confirmation into the slow crafty eyes, \u0027that she\u0027s lived up to her story.\u0027\\n\\n There was no enthusiasm in Kerim\u0027s eyes. He said nothing.\\n\\n Bond shrugged. \u0027I admit I\u0027ve fallen for her. But I\u0027m not a fool, Darko. I\u0027ve been watching for any clue, anything that would help. You know one can tell a lot when certain barriers are down. Well they are down, and I know she\u0027s telling the truth. At any rate ninety per cent of it. And I know she thinks the rest doesn\u0027t matter. If she\u0027s cheating, she\u0027s also being cheated herself. On your chess analogy, that is possible. But you still get back to the question of what it\u0027s all in aid of.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice hardened. \u0027And, if you want to know, all I ask is to go on with the game until we find out.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-29.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \\n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
