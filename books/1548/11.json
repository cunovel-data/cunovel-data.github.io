{"id":107362,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"For, or so they whispered, she would take the camp-stool and draw it up close below the face of the man or woman that hung down over the edge of the interrogation table. Then she would squat down on the stool and look into the face and quietly say \u0027No. 1\u0027 or \u0027No. 10\u0027 or \u0027No. 25\u0027 and the inquisitors would know what she meant and they would begin. And she would watch the eyes in the face a few inches away from hers and breathe in the screams as if they were perfume. And, depending on the eyes, she would quietly change the torture, and say \u0027Now No. 36\u0027 or \u0027Now No. 64\u0027 and the inquisitors would do something else. As the courage and resistance seeped out of the eyes, and they began to weaken and beseech, she would start cooing softly. \u0027There, there my dove. Talk to me, my pretty one, and it will stop. It hurts. Ah me, it hurts so, my child. And one is so tired of the pain. One would like it to stop, and to be able to lie down in peace, and for it never to begin again. Your mother is here beside you, only waiting to stop the pain. She has a nice soft cosy bed all ready for you to sleep on and forget, forget, forget. Speak,\u0027 she would whisper lovingly. \u0027You have only to speak and you will have peace and no more pain.\u0027 If the eyes still resisted, the cooing would start again. \u0027But you are foolish, my pretty one. Oh so foolish. This pain is nothing. Nothing! You don\u0027t believe me, my little dove? Well then, your mother must try a little, but only a very little, of No. 87.\u0027 And the interrogators would hear and change their instruments and their aim, and she would squat there and watch the life slowly ebbing from the eyes until she had to speak loudly into the ear of the person or the words would not reach the brain.\n But it was seldom, so they said, that the person had the will to travel far along SMERSH\u0027S road of pain, let alone to the end, and, when the soft voice promised peace, it nearly always won, for somehow Rosa Klebb knew from the eyes the moment when the adult had been broken down into a child crying for its mother. And she provided the image of the mother and melted the spirit where the harsh words of a man would have toughened it.\n Then, after yet another suspect had been broken, Rosa Klebb would go back down the passage with her camp-stool and take off her newly soiled smock and get back to her work and the word would go round that all was over and normal activity would come back to the basement.\n Tatiana, frozen by her thoughts, looked again at her watch. Four minutes to go. She ran her hands down her uniform and gazed once more at her white face in the glass. She turned and said farewell to the dear, familiar little room. Would she ever see it again?\n She walked straight down the long corridor and rang for the lift.\n When it came, she squared her shoulders and lifted her chin and walked into the lift as if it was the platform of the guillotine.\n \u0027Eighth,\u0027 she said to the girl operator. She stood facing the doors. Inside her, remembering a word she had not used since childhood, she repeated over and over \u0027My God–My God–My God.\u0027\n Chapter Nine\n A Labour of Love\n Outside the anonymous, cream painted door, Tatiana already smelled the inside of the room. When the voice told her curtly to come in, and she opened the door, it was the smell that filled her mind while she stood and stared into the eyes of the woman who sat behind the round table under the centre light.\n It was the smell of the Metro on a hot evening–cheap scent concealing animal odours. People in Russia soak themselves in scent, whether they have had a bath or not, but mostly when they have not, and healthy, clean girls like Tatiana always walk home from the office, unless the rain or the snow is too bad, so as to avoid the stench in the trains and the Metro.\n Now Tatiana was in a bath of the smell. Her nostrils twitched with disgust.\n It was her disgust and her contempt for a person who could live in the middle of such a smell that helped her to look down into the yellowish eyes that stared at her through the square glass panes. Nothing could be read in them. They were receiving eyes, not giving eyes. They slowly moved all over her, like camera lenses, taking in.\n Colonel Klebb spoke:\n \u0027You are a fine-looking girl, Comrade Corporal. Walk across the room and back.\u0027\n What were these honeyed words? Taut with a new fear, fear of the notorious personal habits of the woman, Tatiana did as she was told.\n \u0027Take your jacket off. Put it down on the chair. Raise your hands above your head. Higher. Now bend and touch your toes. Upright. Good. Sit down.\u0027 The woman spoke like a doctor. She gestured to the chair across the table from her. Her staring, probing eyes hooded themselves as they bent over the file on the table.\n It must be my zapiska, thought Tatiana. How interesting to see the actual instrument that ordered the whole of one\u0027s life. How thick it was–nearly two inches thick. What could be on all those pages? She looked across at the open folder with wide, fascinated eyes.\n Colonel Klebb riffled through the last pages and shut down the cover. The cover was orange with a diagonal black stripe. What did those colours signify?\n The woman looked up. Somehow Tatiana managed to look bravely back.\n \u0027Comrade Corporal Romanova.\u0027 It was the voice of authority, of the senior officer. \u0027I have good reports of your work. Your record is excellent, both in your duties and in sport. The State is pleased with you.\u0027\n Tatiana could not believe her ears. She felt faint with reaction. She blushed to the roots of her hair and then turned pale. She put out a hand to the table edge. She stammered in a weak voice, \u0027I am g-grateful, Comrade Colonel.\u0027\n \u0027Because of your excellent services you have been singled out for a most important assignment. This is a great honour for you. Do you understand?\u0027\n Whatever it was, it was better than what might have been. \u0027Yes, indeed, Comrade Colonel.\u0027\n \u0027This assignment carries much responsibility. It bears a higher rank. I congratulate you on your promotion, Comrade Corporal, on completion of the assignment, to the rank of Captain of State Security.\u0027\n This was unheard of for a girl of twenty-four! Tatiana sensed danger. She stiffened like an animal who sees the steel jaws beneath the meat. \u0027I am deeply honoured, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 She was unable to keep the wariness out of her voice.\n Rosa Klebb grunted non-committally. She knew exactly what the girl must have thought when she got the summons. The effect of her kindly reception, her shock of relief at the good news, her reawakening fears, had been transparent. This was a beautiful, guileless, innocent girl. Just what the konspiratsia demanded. Now she must be loosened up. \u0027My dear,\u0027 she said smoothly. \u0027How remiss of me. This promotion should be celebrated in a glass of wine. You must not think we senior officers are inhuman. We will drink together. It will be a good excuse to open a bottle of French champagne.\u0027\n Rosa Klebb got up and went over to the sideboard where her batman had laid out what she had ordered.\n \u0027Try one of these chocolates while I wrestle with the cork. It is never easy getting out champagne corks. We girls really need a man to help us with that sort of work, don\u0027t we?\u0027\n The ghastly prattle went on as she put a spectacular box of chocolates in front of Tatiana. She went back to the sideboard. \u0027They\u0027re from Switzerland. The very best. The soft centres are the round ones. The hard ones are square.\u0027\n Tatiana murmured her thanks. She reached out and chose a round one. It would be easier to swallow. Her mouth was dry with fear of the moment when she would finally see the trap and feel it snap round her neck. It must be something dreadful to need to be concealed under all this play-acting. The bite of chocolate stuck in her mouth like chewing-gum. Mercifully the glass of champagne was thrust into her hand.\n Rosa Klebb stood over her. She lifted her glass merrily. \u0027Za vashe zdarovie, Comrade Tatiana. And my warmest congratulations!\u0027\n Tatiana stitched a ghastly smile on her face. She picked up her glass and gave a little bow. \u0027Za vashe zdarovie, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 She drained the glass, as is the custom in Russian drinking, and put it down in front of her.\n Rosa Klebb immediately filled it again, slopping some over the table-top. \u0027And now to the health of your new department, Comrade.\u0027 She raised her glass. The sugary smile tightened as she watched the girl\u0027s reactions.\n \u0027To SMERSH!\u0027\n Numbly, Tatiana got to her feet. She picked up the full glass. \u0027To SMERSH.\u0027 The word scarcely came out. She choked on the champagne and had to take two gulps. She sat heavily down.\n Rosa Klebb gave her no time for reflection. She sat down opposite and laid her hands flat on the table. \u0027And now to business, Comrade.\u0027 Authority was back in the voice. \u0027There is much work to be done.\u0027 She leant forward. \u0027Have you ever wished to live abroad, Comrade? In a foreign country?\u0027\n The champagne was having its effect on Tatiana. Probably worse was to come, but now let it come quickly.\n \u0027No, Comrade. I am happy in Moscow.\u0027\n \u0027You have never thought what it might be like living in the West–all those beautiful clothes, the jazz, the modern things?\u0027\n \u0027No, Comrade.\u0027 She was truthful. She had never thought about it.\n \u0027And if the State required you to live in the West?\u0027\n \u0027I would obey.\u0027\n \u0027Willingly?\u0027\n Tatiana shrugged her shoulders with a hint of impatience. \u0027One does what one is told.\u0027\n The woman paused. There was girlish conspiracy in the next question.\n \u0027Are you a virgin, Comrade?\u0027\n Oh, my God, thought Tatiana. \u0027No, Comrade Colonel.\u0027\n The wet lips glinted in the light.\n \u0027How many men?\u0027\n Tatiana coloured to the roots of her hair. Russian girls are reticent and prudish about sex. In Russia the sexual climate is mid-Victorian. These questions from the Klebb woman were all the more revolting for being asked in this cold inquisitorial tone by a State official she had never met before in her life. Tatiana screwed up her courage. She stared defensively into the yellow eyes. \u0027What is the purpose of these intimate questions please, Comrade Colonel?\u0027\n Rosa Klebb straightened. Her voice cut back like a whip. \u0027Remember yourself, Comrade. You are not here to ask questions. You forget to whom you are speaking. Answer me!\u0027\n Tatiana shrank back. \u0027Three men, Comrade Colonel.\u0027\n \u0027When. How old were you?\u0027 The hard yellow eyes looked across the table into the hunted blue eyes of the girl and held them and commanded.\n Tatiana was on the edge of tears. \u0027At school. When I was seventeen. Then at the Institute of Foreign Languages. I was twenty-two. Then last year. I was twenty-three. It was a friend I met skating.\u0027\n \u0027Their names, please, Comrade.\u0027 Rosa Klebb picked up a pencil and pulled a scribbling pad towards her.\n Tatiana covered her sobs. \u0027No, never, whatever you do to me. You have no right.\u0027\n \u0027Stop that nonsense.\u0027 The voice was a hiss. \u0027In five minutes I could have those names from you, or anything else I wish to know. You are playing a dangerous game with me, Comrade. My patience will not last for ever.\u0027 Rosa Klebb paused. She was being too rough. \u0027For the moment we will pass on. Tomorrow you will give me the names. No harm will come to these men. They will be asked one or two questions about you–simple technical questions, that is all. Now sit up and dry your tears. We cannot have any more of this foolishness.\u0027\n Rosa Klebb got up and came round the table. She stood looking down at Tatiana. The voice became oily and smooth. \u0027Come, come, my dear. You must trust me. Your little secrets are safe with me. Here, drink some more champagne and forget this little unpleasantness. We must be friends. We have work to do together. You must learn, my dear Tania, to treat me as you would your mother. Here, drink this down.\u0027\n Tatiana pulled a handkerchief out of the waistband of her skirt and dabbed at her eyes. She reached out a trembling hand for the glass of champagne and sipped at it with bowed head. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-11.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
