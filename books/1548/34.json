{"id":107384,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"The change of rooms at the hotel. The honeymoon suite. The big mirror behind the bed. How well it all fitted! Bond felt his hands wet with perspiration He wiped them down his trousers. \u0027Steady, old man. You nearly got it then. I told you not to move, remember?\u0027 Bond put his hands back on the book in his lap. How much could he develop these small movements? How far could he go? \u0027Get on with the story,\u0027 he said. \u0027Did the girl know these pictures were being taken? Did she know SMERSH was involved in this?\u0027 Nash snorted. \u0027Of course she didn\u0027t know about the pictures. Rosa didn\u0027t trust her a yard. Too emotional. But I don\u0027t know much about that side. We all worked in compartments. I\u0027d never seen her until today. I only know what I picked up. Yes, of course the girl knew she was working for SMERSH. She was told she had to get to London and do a bit of spying there.\u0027 The silly idiot, thought Bond. Why the hell hadn\u0027t she told him that SMERSH was involved? She must have been frightened even to speak the name. Thought he would have her locked up or something. She had always said she would tell him everything when she got to England. That he must have faith and not be afraid. Faith! When she hadn\u0027t the foggiest idea herself what was going on. Oh, well. Poor child. She had been as fooled as he had been. But any hint would have been enough–would have saved the life of Kerim, for instance. And what about hers and his own? \u0027Then this Turk of yours had to be got rid of. I gather that took a bit of doing. Tough nut. I suppose it was his gang that blew up our Centre in Istanbul yesterday afternoon. That\u0027s going to create a bit of a panic.\u0027 \u0027Too bad.\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t worry me, old man. My end of the job\u0027s going to be easy.\u0027 Nash took a quick glance at his wrist watch. \u0027In about twenty minutes we go into the Simplon tunnel. That\u0027s where they want it done. More drama for the papers. One bullet for you. As we go into the tunnel. Just one in the heart. The noise of the tunnel will help in case you\u0027re a noisy dier–rattle and so forth. Then one in the back of the neck for her–with your gun–and out of the window she goes. Then one more for you with your gun. With your fingers wrapped round it, of course. Plenty of powder on your shirt. Suicide. That\u0027s what it\u0027ll look like at first. But there\u0027ll be two bullets in your heart. That\u0027ll come out later. More mystery! Search the Simplon again. Who was the man with the fair hair? They\u0027ll find the film in her bag, and in your pocket there\u0027ll be a long love letter from her to you–a bit threatening. It\u0027s a good one. SMERSH wrote it. It says that she\u0027ll give the film to the newspapers unless you marry her. That you promised to marry her if she stole the Spektor . . .\u0027 Nash paused and added in parentheses, \u0027As a matter of fact, old man, the Spektor\u0027s booby-trapped. When your cipher experts start fiddling with it, it\u0027s going to blow them all to glory. Not a bad dividend on the side.\u0027 Nash chuckled dully. \u0027And then the letter says that all she\u0027s got to offer you is the machine and her body–and all about her body and what you did with it. Hot stuff, that part! Right? So what\u0027s the story in the papers–the Left Wing ones that will be tipped off to meet the train? Old man, the story\u0027s got everything. Orient Express. Beautiful Russian spy murdered in Simplon tunnel. Filthy pictures. Secret cipher machine. Handsome British spy with career ruined murders her and commits suicide. Sex, spies, luxury train, Mr and Mrs Somerset . . .! Old man, it\u0027ll run for months! Talk of the Khoklov case! This\u0027ll knock spots off it. And what a poke in the eye for the famous Intelligence Service! Their best man, the famous James Bond. What a shambles. Then bang goes the cipher machine! What\u0027s your chief going to think of you? What\u0027s the public going to think? And the Government. And the Americans? Talk about security! No more atom secrets from the Yanks.\u0027 Nash paused to let it all sink in. With a touch of pride he said, \u0027Old man, this is going to be the story of the century!\u0027 Yes, thought Bond. Yes. He was certainly right about that. The French papers would give it such a send-off there\u0027d be no stopping it. They wouldn\u0027t mind how far they went with the pictures or anything else. There wasn\u0027t a press in the world that wouldn\u0027t pick it up. And the Spektor! Would M\u0027s people or the Deuxième have the sense to guess it was booby-trapped? How many of the best cryptographers in the West would go up with it? God, he must get out of this jam! But how? The top of Nash\u0027s War and Peace yawned at him. Let\u0027s see. There would be the roar as the train went into the tunnel. Then at once the muffled click and the bullet. Bond\u0027s eyes stared into the violet gloom, measuring the depth of the shadow in his corner under the roof of the top bunk, remembering exactly where his attaché case stood on the floor, guessing what Nash would do after he had fired. Bond said: \u0027You took a bit of a gamble on my letting you team up at Trieste. And how did you know the code of the month?\u0027 Nash said patiently, \u0027You don\u0027t seem to get the picture, old man. SMERSH is good–really good. There\u0027s nothing better. We know your code of the month for every year. If anyone in your show noticed these things, noticed the pattern of them, like my show does, you\u0027d realize that every January you lose one of your small chaps somewhere–maybe Tokyo, maybe Timbuctoo. SMERSH just picks one and takes him. Then they screw the code for the year out of him. Anything else he knows, of course. But it\u0027s the code they\u0027re after. Then it\u0027s passed round to the Centres. Simple as falling off a log, old man.\u0027 Bond dug his nails into the palms of his hands. \u0027As for picking you up at Trieste, old man, I didn\u0027t. Rode down with you–in the front of the train. Got out as we stopped and walked back up the platform. You see, old man, we were waiting for you in Belgrade. Knew you\u0027d call your Chief–or the Embassy or someone. Been listening in on that Yugoslav\u0027s telephone for weeks. Pity we didn\u0027t understand the codeword he shot through to Istanbul. Might have stopped the firework display, or anyway saved our chaps. But the main target was you, old man, and we certainly had you sewn up all right. You were in the killing bottle from the minute you got off that plane in Turkey. It was only a question of when to stuff the cork in.\u0027 Nash took another quick glance at his watch. He looked up. His\u0027grinning teeth glistened violet. \u0027Pretty soon now, old man. It\u0027s just cork-hours minus fifteen.\u0027 Bond thought: we knew SMERSH was good, but we never knew they were as good as this. The knowledge was vital. Somehow he must get it back. He MUST. Bond\u0027s mind raced round the details of his pitifully thin, pitifully desperate plan. He said: \u0027SMERSH seems to have thought things out pretty well. Must have taken a lot of trouble. There\u0027s only one thing . . .\u0027 Bond let his voice hang in the air. \u0027What\u0027s that, old man?\u0027 Nash, thinking of his report, was alert. The train began to slow down. Domodossola. The Italian frontier. What about customs? But Bond remembered. There were no formalities for the through carriages until they got to France, to the frontier, Vallorbes. Even then not for the sleeping cars. These expresses cut straight across Switzerland. It was only people who got out at Brigue or Lausanne who had to go through customs in the stations. \u0027Well, come on, old man.\u0027 Nash sounded hooked. \u0027Not without a cigarette.\u0027 \u0027Okay. Go ahead. But if there\u0027s a move I don\u0027t like, you\u0027ll be dead.\u0027 Bond slipped his right hand into his hip-pocket. He drew out his broad gunmetal cigarette case. Opened it. Took out a cigarette. Took his lighter out of his trouser pocket. Lit the cigarette and put the lighter back. He left the cigarette case on his lap beside the book. He put his left hand casually over the book and the cigarette case as if to prevent them slipping off his lap. He puffed away at his cigarette. If only it had been a trick one–magnesium flare, or anything he could throw in the man\u0027s face! If only his Service went in for those explosive toys! But at least he had achieved his objective and hadn\u0027t been shot in the process. That was a start. \u0027You see.\u0027 Bond described an airy circle with his cigarette to distract Nash\u0027s attention. His left hand slipped the flat cigarette case between the pages of his book. \u0027You see, it looks all right, but what about you? What are you going to do after we come out of the Simplon? The conductor knows you\u0027re mixed up with us. They\u0027ll be after you in a flash.\u0027 \u0027Oh that,\u0027 Nash\u0027s voice was bored again. \u0027You don\u0027t seem to have hoisted in that the Russians think these things out. I get off at Dijon and take a car to Paris. I get lost there. A bit of \u0027\u0027Third Man\u0027\u0027 stuff won\u0027t do the story any harm. Anyway it\u0027ll come out later that they dig the second bullet out of you and can\u0027t find the second gun. They won\u0027t catch up with me. Matter of fact, I\u0027ve got a date at noon tomorrow–Room 204 at the Ritz Hotel, making my report to Rosa. She wants to get the kudos for this job. Then I turn into her chauffeur and we drive to Berlin. Come to think of it, old man,\u0027 the flat voice showed emotion, became greedy, \u0027I think she may have the Order of Lenin for me in her bag. Lovely grub, as they say.\u0027 The train began to move. Bond tensed. In a few minutes it would come. What a way to die, if he was going to die. Through his own stupidity–blind, lethal stupidity. And lethal for Tatiana. Christ! At any moment he could have done something to dodge this shambles. There had been no lack of opportunity. But conceit and curiosity and four days of love had sucked him along on the easy stream down which it had been planned that he should drift. That was the damnable part of the whole business–the triumph for SMERSH, the one enemy he had always sworn to defeat wherever he met it. We will do this, and he will do that. \u0027Comrades, it is easy with a vain fool like this Bond. Watch him take the bait. You will see. I tell you he\u0027s a fool. All Englishmen are fools.\u0027 And Tatiana, the lure–the darling lure. Bond thought of their first night. The black stockings and the velvet ribbon. And all the time SMERSH had been watching, watching him go through his conceited paces, as it had been planned that he would, so that the smear could be built up–the smear on him, the smear on M who had sent him to Istanbul, the smear on the Service that lived on the myth of its name. God, what a mess! If only ... if only his tiny grain of a plan might work! Ahead, the rumble of the train became a deep boom. A few more seconds. A few more yards. The oval mouth between the white pages seemed to gape wider. In a second the dark tunnel would switch out the moonlight on the pages and the blue tongue would lick out for him. \u0027Sweet dreams, you English bastard.\u0027 The rumble became a great swift clanging roar. The spine of the book bloomed flame. The bullet, homing on Bond\u0027s heart, flashed over its two quiet yards. Bond pitched forward on to the floor and lay sprawled under the funereal violet light. Chapter Twenty-Seven Ten Pints of Blood It had all depended on the man\u0027s accuracy. Nash had said that Bond would get one bullet through the heart. Bond had taken the gamble that Nash\u0027s aim was as good as he said it was. And it had been. Bond lay like a dead man lies. Before the bullet, he had recalled the corpses he had seen–how their bodies had looked in death. Now he lay totally collapsed, like a broken doll, his arms and legs carefully outflung. He explored his sensations. Where the bullet had crashed into the book, his ribs were on fire. The bullet must have gone through the cigarette case and then through the other half of the book. He could feel the hot lead over his heart. It felt as if it was burning inside his ribs. It was only a sharp pain in his head where it had hit the woodwork, and the violet sheen on the scuffed toecaps against his nose, that said he wasn\u0027t dead. Like an archaeologist, Bond explored the carefully planned ruin of his body. The position of the sprawled feet. The angle of the half-bent knee that would give purchase when it was needed. The right hand that seemed to be clawing at his pierced heart, was within inches, when he could release the book, of the little attaché case–within inches of the lateral stitching that held the flat-bladed throwing-knives, two edged and sharp as razors, that he had mocked when Q Branch had demonstrated the catch that held them.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-34.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
