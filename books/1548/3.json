{"id":107354,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Grant won the championship in 1945, on his eighteenth birthday, then they took him for National Service and he became a driver in the Royal Corps of Signals. The training period in England sobered him, or at least made him more careful when he had \u0027The Feelings\u0027. Now, at the full moon, he took to drink instead. He would take a bottle of whisky into the woods round Aldershot and drink it all down as he watched his sensations, coldly, until unconsciousness came. Then, in the early hours of the morning, he would stagger back to camp, only half satisfied, but not dangerous any more. If a sentry caught him, it was only a day\u0027s C.B., because his commanding officer wanted to keep him happy for the Army championships. But Grant\u0027s transport section was rushed to Berlin about the time of the Corridor trouble with the Russians and he missed the championships. In Berlin, the constant smell of danger intrigued him and made him even more careful and cunning. He still got dead drunk at the full moon, but all the rest of the time he was watching and plotting. He liked all he heard about the Russians, their brutality, their carelessness of human life, and their guile, and he decided to go over to them. But how? What could he bring them as a gift? What did they want? It was the B.A.O.R. championships that finally told him to go over. By chance they took place on a night of the full moon. Grant, fighting for the Royal Corps, was warned for holding and hitting low and was disqualified in the third round for persistent foul fighting. The whole stadium hissed him as he left the ring–the loudest demonstration came from his own regiment–and the next morning the commanding officer sent for him and coldly said he was a disgrace to the Royal Corps and would be sent home with the next draft. His fellow drivers sent him to Coventry and, since no one would drive transport with him, he had to be transferred to the coveted motor cycle dispatch service. The transfer could not have suited Grant better. He waited a few days and then, one evening when he had collected the day\u0027s out-going mail from the Military Intelligence Headquarters on the Reichskanzlerplatz, he made straight for the Russian Sector, waited with his engine running until the British control gate was opened to allow a taxi through, and then tore through the closing gate at forty and skidded to a stop beside the concrete pillbox of the Russian Frontier post. They hauled him roughly into the guardroom. A wooden-faced officer behind a desk asked him what he wanted. \u0027I want the Soviet Secret Service,\u0027 said Grant flatly. \u0027The Head of it.\u0027 The officer stared coldly at him. He said something in Russian. The soldiers who had brought Grant in started to drag him out again. Grant easily shook them off. One of them lifted his tommy-gun. Grant said, speaking patiently and distinctly, \u0027I have a lot of secret papers. Outside. In the leather bags on the motor cycle.\u0027 He had a brainwave. \u0027You will get into bad trouble if they don\u0027t get to your Secret Service.\u0027 The officer said something to the soldiers and they stood back. \u0027We have no Secret Service,\u0027 he said in stilted English. \u0027Sit down and complete this form.\u0027 Grant sat down at the desk and filled in a long form which asked questions about anyone who wanted to visit the Eastern zone–name, address, nature of business and so forth. Meanwhile the officer spoke softly and briefly into a telephone. By the time Grant had finished, two more soldiers, non-commissioned officers wearing drab green forage caps and with green badges of rank on their khaki uniforms, had come into the room. The frontier officer handed the form, without looking at it, to one of them and they took Grant out and put him and his motor cycle into the back of a closed van and locked the door on him. After a fast drive lasting a quarter of an hour the van stopped, and when Grant got out he found himself in the courtyard behind a large new building. He was taken into the building and up in a lift and left alone in a cell without windows. It contained nothing but one iron bench. After an hour, during which, he supposed, they went through the secret papers, he was led into a comfortable office in which an officer with three rows of decorations and the gold tabs of a full colonel was sitting behind a desk. The desk was bare except for a bowl of roses. Ten years later, Grant, looking out of the window of the plane at a wide cluster of lights twenty thousand feet below, which he guessed was Kharkov, grinned mirthlessly at his reflection in the Perspex window. Roses. From that moment his life had been nothing but roses. Roses, roses, all the way. Chapter Three Post-Graduate Studies \u0027So you would like to work in the Soviet Union, Mister Grant?\u0027 It was half an hour later and the M.G.B. colonel was bored with the interview. He thought that he had extracted from this rather unpleasant British soldier every military detail that could possibly be of interest. A few polite phrases to repay the man for the rich haul of secrets his dispatch bags had yielded, and then the man could go down to the cells and in due course be shipped off to Vorkuta or some other labour camp. \u0027Yes, I would like to work for you.\u0027 \u0027And what work could you do, Mister Grant? We have plenty of unskilled labour. We do not need truck-drivers and,\u0027 the colonel smiled fleetingly, \u0027if there is any boxing to be done we have plenty of men who can box. Two possible Olympic champions among them, incidentally.\u0027 \u0027I am an expert at killing people. I do it very well. I like it.\u0027 The colonel saw the red flame that flickered for an instant behind the very pale blue eyes under the sandy lashes. He thought, the man means it. He\u0027s mad as well as unpleasant. He looked coldly at Grant, wondering if it was worth while wasting food on him at Vorkuta. Better perhaps to have him shot. Or throw him back into the British Sector and let his own people worry about him. \u0027You don\u0027t believe me,\u0027 said Grant impatiently. This was the wrong man, the wrong department. \u0027Who does the rough stuff for you here?\u0027 He was certain the Russians had some sort of a murder squad. Everybody said so. \u0027Let me talk to them. I\u0027ll kill somebody for them. Anybody they like. Now.\u0027 The colonel looked at him sourly. Perhaps he had better report the matter. \u0027Wait here.\u0027 He got up and went out of the room, leaving the door open. A guard came and stood in the doorway and watched Grant\u0027s back, his hand on his pistol. The colonel went into the next room. It was empty. There were three telephones on the desk. He picked up the receiver of the M.G.B. direct line to Moscow. When the military operator answered he said, \u0027SMERSH\u0027. When SMERSH answered he asked for the Chief of Operations. Ten minutes later he put the receiver back. What luck! A simple, constructive solution. Whichever way it went it would turn out well. If the Englishman succeeded, it would be splendid. If he failed, it would still cause a lot of trouble in the Western Sector–trouble for the British because Grant was their man, trouble with the Germans because the attempt would frighten a lot of their spies, trouble with the Americans because they were supplying most of the funds for the Baumgarten ring and would now think Baumgarten\u0027s security was no good. Pleased with himself, the colonel walked back into his office and sat down again opposite Grant. \u0027You mean what you say?\u0027 \u0027Of course I do.\u0027 \u0027Have you a good memory?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027In the British Sector there is a German called Dr. Baumgarten. He lives in Flat 5 at No. 22 Kurfürstendamm. Do you know where that is?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Tonight, with your motor cycle, you will be put back into the British Sector. Your number plates will be changed. Your people will be on the lookout for you. You will take an envelope to Dr. Baumgarten. It will be marked to be delivered by hand. In your uniform, and with this envelope, you will have no difficulty. You will say that the message is so private that you must see Dr. Baumgarten alone. Then you will kill him.\u0027 The colonel paused. His eyebrows lifted. \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Grant stolidly. \u0027And if I do, will you give me more of this work?\u0027 \u0027It is possible,\u0027 said the colonel indifferently. \u0027First you must show what you can do. When you have completed your task and returned to the Soviet Sector, you may ask for Colonel Boris.\u0027 He rang a bell and a man in plain clothes came in. The colonel gestured towards him. \u0027This man will give you food. Later he will give you the envelope and a sharp knife of American manufacture. It is an excellent weapon. Good luck.\u0027 The colonel reached and picked a rose out of the bowl and sniffed it luxuriously. Grant got to his feet. \u0027Thank you, sir,\u0027 he said warmly. The colonel did not answer or look up from the rose. Grant followed the man in plain clothes out of the room. The plane roared on across the Heartland of Russia. They had left behind them the blast furnaces flaming far away to the east around Stalino and, to the west, the silver thread of the Dnieper branching away at Dnepropetrovsk. The splash of light around Kharkov had marked the frontier of the Ukraine, and the smaller blaze of the phosphate town of Kursk had come and gone. Now Grant knew that the solid unbroken blackness below hid the great central Steppe where the billions of tons of Russia\u0027s grain were whispering and ripening in the darkness. There would be no more oases of light until, in another hour, they would have covered the last three hundred miles to Moscow. For by now Grant knew a lot about Russia. After the quick, neat, sensational murder of a vital West German spy, Grant had no sooner slipped back over the frontier and somehow fumbled his way to \u0027Colonel Boris\u0027 than he was put into plain clothes, with a flying helmet to cover his hair, hustled into an empty M.G.B. plane and flown straight to Moscow. Then began a year of semi-prison which Grant had devoted to keeping fit and to learning Russian while people came and went around him–interrogators, stool-pigeons, doctors. Meanwhile, Soviet spies in England and Northern Ireland had painstakingly investigated his past. At the end of the year Grant was given as clean a bill of political health as any foreigner can get in Russia. The spies had confirmed his story. The English and American stool-pigeons reported that he was totally uninterested in the politics or social customs of any country in the world, and the doctors and psychologists agreed that he was an advanced manic depressive whose periods coincided with the full moon. They added that Grant was also a narcissist and asexual and that his tolerance of pain was high. These peculiarities apart, his physical health was superb and, though his educational standards were hopelessly low, he was as naturally cunning as a fox. Everyone agreed that Grant was an exceedingly dangerous member of society and that he should be put away. When the dossier came before the Head of Personnel of the M.G.B., he was about to write \u0027Kill him\u0027 in the margin when he had second thoughts. A great deal of killing has to be done in the U.S.S.R., not because the average Russian is a cruel man, although some of their races are among the cruellest peoples in the world, but as an instrument of policy. People who act against the State are enemies of the State, and the State has no room for enemies. There is too much to do for precious time to be allotted to them, and, if they are a persistent nuisance, they get killed. In a country with a population of 200,000,000, you can kill many thousands a year without missing them. If, as happened in the two biggest purges, a million people have to be killed in one year, that is also not a grave loss. The serious problem is the shortage of executioners. Executioners have a short \u0027life\u0027. They get tired of the work. The soul sickens of it. After ten, twenty, a hundred death-rattles, the human being, however sub-human he may be, acquires, perhaps by a process of osmosis with death itself, a germ of death which enters his body and eats into him like a canker. Melancholy and drink take him, and a dreadful lassitude which brings a glaze to the eyes and slows up the movements and destroys accuracy. When the employer sees these signs he has no alternative but to execute the executioner and find another one.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-3.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
