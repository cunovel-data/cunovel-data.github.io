He says we\u0027re one of the only folk in the square that haven\u0027t got one. Sees there isn\u0027t one of those aerial things on the house, I dare say. He\u0027s always asking if you\u0027re at home so that he can have a word with you about it. Fancy his cheek! I\u0027m surprised he hasn\u0027t thought to catch you coming in or going out. He\u0027s always asking if I\u0027m expecting you home. Naturally I don\u0027t tell him anything about your movements. Respectable, quiet-spoken body, if he wasn\u0027t so persistent.\u0027 Could be, thought Bond. There are many ways of checking up whether the owner\u0027s at home or away. A servant\u0027s appearance and reactions–a glance through the open door. \u0027Well, you\u0027re wasting your time because he\u0027s away,\u0027 would be the obvious reception if the flat was empty. Should he tell the Security Section? Bond shrugged his shoulders irritably. What the hell. There was probably nothing in it. Why should They be interested in him? And, if there was something in it, Security was quite capable of making him change his flat. \u0027I expect you\u0027ve frightened him away this time.\u0027 Bond smiled up at May. \u0027I should think you\u0027ve heard the last of him.\u0027 \u0027Yes-s,\u0027 said May doubtfully. At any rate she had carried out her orders to tell him if she saw anyone \u0027hanging about the place\u0027. She bustled off with a whisper of the old-fashioned black uniform she persisted in wearing even in the heat of August. Bond went back to his breakfast. Normally it was little straws in the wind like this that would start a persistent intuitive ticking in his mind, and, on other days, he would not have been happy until he had solved the problem of the man from the Communist Union who kept on coming to the house. Now, from months of idleness and disuse, the sword was rusty in the scabbard and Bond\u0027s mental guard was down. Breakfast was Bond\u0027s favourite meal of the day. When he was stationed in London it was always the same. It consisted of very strong coffee, from De Bry in New Oxford Street, brewed in an American Chemex, of which he drank two large cups, black and without sugar. The single egg, in the dark blue egg cup with a gold ring round the top, was boiled for three and a third minutes. It was a very fresh, speckled brown egg from French Marans hens owned by some friend of May in the country. (Bond disliked white eggs and, faddish as he was in many small things, it amused him to maintain that there was such a thing as the perfect boiled egg.) Then there were two thick slices of wholewheat toast, a large pat of deep yellow Jersey butter and three squat glass jars containing Tiptree \u0027Little Scarlet\u0027 strawberry jam; Cooper\u0027s Vintage Oxford marmalade and Norwegian Heather Honey from Fortnum\u0027s. The coffee pot and the silver on the tray were Queen Anne, and the china was Minton, of the same dark blue and gold and white as the egg-cup. That morning, while Bond finished his breakfast with honey, he pinpointed the immediate cause of his lethargy and of his low spirits. To begin with, Tiffany Case, his love for so many happy months, had left him and, after final painful weeks during which she had withdrawn to an hotel, had sailed for America at the end of July. He missed her badly and his mind still sheered away from the thought of her. And it was August, and London was hot and stale. He was due for leave, but he had not the energy or the desire to go off alone, or to try and find some temporary replacement for Tiffany to go with him. So he had stayed on in the half-empty headquarters of the Secret Service grinding away at the old routines, snapping at his secretary and rasping his colleagues. Even M had finally got impatient with the surly caged tiger on the floor below, and, on Monday of this particular week, he had sent Bond a sharp note appointing him to a Committee of Inquiry under Paymaster Captain Troop. The note said that it was time Bond, as a senior officer in the Service, took a hand in major administrative problems. Anyway, there was no one else available. Headquarters were short-handed and the 00 Section was quiescent. Bond would pray report that afternoon, at 2.30, to Room 412. It was Troop, reflected Bond, as he lit his first cigarette of the day, who was the most nagging and immediate cause of his discontent. In every large business, there is one man who is the office tyrant and bugbear and who is cordially disliked by all the staff. This individual performs an unconsciously important role by acting as a kind of lightning conductor for the usual office hates and fears. In fact, he reduces their disruptive influence by providing them with a common target. The man is usually the general manager, or the Head of Admin. He is that indispensable man who is a watchdog over the small things–petty cash, heat and light, towels and soap in the lavatories, stationery supplies, the canteen, the holiday rota, the punctuality of the staff. He is the one man who has real impact on the office comforts and amenities and whose authority extends into the privacy and personal habits of the men and women of the organization. To want such a job, and to have the necessary qualifications for it, the man must have exactly those qualities which irritate and abrade. He must be a strong disciplinarian and indifferent to opinion. He must be a little dictator. In all well-run businesses there is such a man. In the Secret Service, it is Paymaster Captain Troop, R.N. Retired, Head of Admin., whose job it is, in his own words, \u0027to keep the place shipshape and Bristol fashion\u0027. It was inevitable that Captain Troop\u0027s duties would bring him into conflict with most of the organization, but it was particularly unfortunate that M could think of no one but Troop to spare as Chairman for this particular Committee. For this was yet one more of those Committees of Inquiry dealing with the delicate intricacies of the Burgess and Maclean case, and with the lessons that could be learned from it. M had dreamed it up, five years after he had closed his own particular file on that case, purely as a sop to the Privy Council Inquiry into the Security Services which the Prime Minister had ordered in 1955. At once Bond had got into a hopeless wrangle with Troop over the employment of \u0027intellectuals\u0027 in the Secret Service. Perversely, and knowing it would annoy, Bond had put forward the proposition that, if M.I.5 and the Secret Service were to concern themselves seriously with the atom age \u0027intellectual spy\u0027, they must employ a certain number of intellectuals to counter them. \u0027Retired officers of the Indian Army,\u0027 Bond had pronounced, \u0027can\u0027t possibly understand the thought processes of a Burgess or a Maclean. They won\u0027t even know such people exist–let alone be in a position to frequent their cliques and get to know their friends and their secrets. Once Burgess and Maclean went to Russia, the only way to make contact with them again and, perhaps, when they got tired of Russia, turn them into double agents against the Russians, would have been to send their closest friends to Moscow and Prague and Budapest with orders to wait until one of these chaps crept out of the masonry and made contact. And one of them, probably Burgess, would have been driven to make contact by his loneliness and by his ache to tell his story to someone. [Note: *Written in March 1956. I. F.] But they certainly wouldn\u0027t take the risk of revealing themselves to someone with a trench-coat and a cavalry moustache and a beta minus mind.\u0027 \u0027Oh really,\u0027 Troop had said with icy calm. \u0027So you suggest we should staff the organization with long-haired perverts. That\u0027s quite an original notion. I thought we were all agreed that homosexuals were about the worst security risk there is. I can\u0027t see the Americans handing over many atom secrets to a lot of pansies soaked in scent.\u0027 \u0027All intellectuals aren\u0027t homosexual. And many of them are bald. I\u0027m just saying that ...,\u0027 and so the argument had gone on intermittently through the hearings of the past three days, and the other committee members had ranged themselves more or less with Troop. Now, today, they had to draw up their recommendations and Bond was wondering whether to take the unpopular step of entering a minority report. How seriously did he feel about the whole question, Bond wondered as, at nine o\u0027clock, he walked out of his flat and down the steps to his car? Was he just being petty and obstinate? Had he constituted himself into a one-man opposition only to give his teeth something to bite into? Was he so bored that he could find nothing better to do than make a nuisance of himself inside his own organization? Bond couldn\u0027t make up his mind. He felt restless and indecisive, and, behind it all, there was a nagging disquiet he couldn\u0027t put his finger on. As he pressed the self-starter and the twin exhausts of the Bentley woke to their fluttering growl, a curious bastard quotation slipped from nowhere into Bond\u0027s mind. \u0027Those whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first make bored.\u0027 Chapter Twelve A Piece of Cake As it turned out, Bond never had to make a decision on the Committee\u0027s final report. He had complimented his secretary on a new summer frock, and was half way through the file of signals that had come in during the night, when the red telephone that could only mean M or his Chief-of-Staff gave its soft, peremptory burr. Bond picked up the receiver. \u0027007.\u0027 \u0027Can you come up?\u0027 It was the Chief-of-Staff. \u0027M?\u0027 \u0027Yes. And it looks like a long session. I\u0027ve told Troop you won\u0027t be able to make the Committee.\u0027 \u0027Any idea what it\u0027s about?\u0027 The Chief-of-Staff chuckled. \u0027Well, I have as a matter of fact. But you\u0027d better hear about it from him. It\u0027ll make you sit up. There\u0027s quite a swerve on this one.\u0027 As Bond put on his coat and went out into the corridor, banging the door behind him he had a feeling of certainty that the starter\u0027s gun had fired and that the dog days had come to an end. Even the ride up to the top floor in the lift and the walk down the long quiet corridor to the door of M\u0027s small office seemed to be charged with the significance of all those other occasions when the bell of the red telephone had been the signal that had fired him, like a loaded projectile, across the world towards some distant target of M\u0027s choosing. And the eyes of Miss Moneypenny, M\u0027s private secretary, had that old look of excitement and secret knowledge as she smiled up at him and pressed the switch on the intercom. \u0027007\u0027s here, sir.\u0027 \u0027Send him in,\u0027 said the metallic voice, and the red light of privacy went on above the door. Bond went through the door and closed it softly behind him. The room was cool, or perhaps it was the Venetian blinds that gave an impression of coolness. They threw bars of light and shadow across the dark green carpet up to the edge of the big central desk. There the sunshine stopped so that the quiet figure behind the desk sat in a pool of suffused greenish shade. In the ceiling directly above the desk, a big twin-bladed tropical fan, a recent addition to M\u0027s room, slowly revolved, shifting the thundery August air that, even high up above the Regent\u0027s Park, was heavy and stale after a week of heat-wave. M gestured to the chair opposite him across the red leather desk. Bond sat down and looked across into the tranquil, lined sailor\u0027s face that he loved, honoured and obeyed. \u0027Do you mind if I ask you a personal question, James?\u0027 M never asked his staff personal questions and Bond couldn\u0027t imagine what was coming. \u0027No, sir.\u0027 M picked his pipe out of the big copper ash-tray and began to fill it, thoughtfully watching his fingers at work with the tobacco. He said harshly: \u0027You needn\u0027t answer, but it\u0027s to do with your, er, friend, Miss Case. As you know, I don\u0027t generally interest myself in these matters, but I did hear that you had been, er, seeing a lot of each other since that diamond business. Even some idea you might be going to get married.\u0027 M glanced up at Bond and then down again. He put the loaded pipe into his mouth and set a match to it. Out of the corner of his mouth, as he drew at the jigging flame, he said: \u0027Care to tell me anything about it?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-14.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
