He laughed abruptly.\\n\\n \u0027If it was me, my friend, I would slip off the train at Salonica–with the machine, and, if you like, with the girl also, though that is not so important. I would take a hired car to Athens and get on the next plane for London. But I was not brought up \u0027\u0027to be a sport\u0027\u0027.\u0027 Kerim put irony into the words. \u0027This is not a game to me. It is a business. For you it is different. You are a gambler. M also is a gambler. He obviously is, or he would not have given you a free hand. He also wants to know the answer to this riddle. So be it. But I like to play safe, to make certain, to leave as little as possible to chance. You think the odds look right, that they are in your favour?\u0027 Darko Kerim turned and faced Bond. His voice became insistent. \u0027Listen, my friend,\u0027 he put a huge hand on Bond\u0027s shoulder. \u0027This is a billiard table. An easy, flat, green billiard table. And you have hit your white ball and it is travelling easily and quietly towards the red. The pocket is alongside. Fatally, inevitably, you are going to hit the red and the red is going into that pocket. It is the law of the billiard table, the law of the billiard room. But, outside the orbit of these things, a jet pilot has fainted and his plane is diving straight at that billiard room, or a gas main is about to explode, or lightning is about to strike. And the building collapses on top of you and on top of the billiard table. Then what has happened to that white ball that could not miss the red ball, and to the red ball that could not miss the pocket? The white ball could not miss according to the laws of the billiard table. But the laws of the billiard table are not the only laws, and the laws governing the progress of this train, and of you to your destination, are also not the only laws in this particular game.\u0027\\n\\n Kerim paused. He dismissed his harangue with a shrug of the shoulders. \u0027You already know these things, my friend,\u0027 he said apologetically. \u0027And I have made myself thirsty talking platitudes. Hurry the girl up and we will go and eat. But watch for surprises, I beg of you.\u0027 He made a cross with his finger over the centre of his coat. \u0027I do not cross my heart. That is being too serious. But I cross my stomach, which is an important oath for me. There are surprises on the way for both of us. The gipsy said to watch out. Now I say the same. We can play the game on the billiard table, but we must both be on guard against the world outside the billiard room. My nose,\u0027 he tapped it, \u0027tells me so.\u0027\\n\\n Kerim\u0027s stomach made an indignant noise like a forgotten telephone receiver with an angry caller on the other end. \u0027There,\u0027 he said solicitously. \u0027What did I say? We must go and eat.\u0027\\n\\n They finished their dinner as the train pulled into the hideous modern junction of Thessaloniki. With Bond carrying the heavy little bag, they went back down the train and parted for the night. \u0027We shall soon be disturbed again,\u0027 warned Kerim. \u0027There is the frontier at one o\u0027clock. The Greeks will be no trouble, but those Yugoslavs like waking up anyone who is travelling soft. If they annoy you, send for me. Even in their country there are some names I can mention. I am in the second compartment in the next carriage. I have it to myself. Tomorrow I will move into our friend Goldfarb\u0027s bed in No. 12. For the time being, the first-class is an adequate stable.\u0027\\n\\n Bond dozed wakefully as the train laboured up the moonlit valley of the Vardar towards the instep of Yugoslavia. Tatiana again slept with her head in his lap. He thought of what Darko had said. He wondered if he should not send the big man back to Istanbul when they had got safely through Belgrade. It was not fair to drag him across Europe on an adventure that was outside his territory and with which he had little sympathy. Darko obviously suspected that Bond had become infatuated with the girl and wasn\u0027t seeing the operation straight any more. Well, there was a grain of truth in that. It would certainly be safer to get off the train and take another route home. But, Bond admitted to himself, he couldn\u0027t bear the idea of running away from this plot, if it was a plot. If it wasn\u0027t, he equally couldn\u0027t bear the idea of sacrificing the three more days with Tatiana. And M had left the decision to him. As Darko had said, M also was curious to see the game through. Perversely, M too wanted to see what this whole rigmarole was about. Bond dismissed the problem. The journey was going well. Once again, why panic?\\n\\n Ten minutes after they had arrived at the Greek frontier station of Idomeni there was a hasty knocking on the door. It woke the girl. Bond slipped from under her head. He put his ear to the door. \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Le conducteur, Monsieur. There has been an accident. Your friend Kerim Bey.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Bond fiercely. He fitted the Beretta into its holster and put on his coat. He tore open the door.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027\\n\\n The conductor\u0027s face was yellow under the corridor light. \u0027Come.\u0027 He ran down the corridor towards the first-class.\\n\\n Officials were clustered round the open door of the second compartment. They were standing, staring.\\n\\n The conductor made a path for Bond. Bond reached the door and looked in.\\n\\n The hair stirred softly on his head. Along the right-hand seat were two bodies. They were frozen in a ghastly death-struggle that might have been posed for a film.\\n\\n Underneath was Kerim, his knees up in a last effort to rise. The taped hilt of a dagger protruded from his neck near the jugular vein. His head was thrust back and the empty bloodshot eyes stared up at the light. The mouth was contorted into a snarl. A thin trickle of blood ran down the chin.\\n\\n Half on top of him sprawled the heavy body of the M.G.B. man called Benz, locked there by Kerim\u0027s left arm round his neck. Bond could see a corner of the Stalin moustache and the side of a blackened face. Kerim\u0027s right arm lay across the man\u0027s back, almost casually. The hand ended in a closed fist and the knob of a knife-hilt, and there was a wide stain on the coat under the hand.\\n\\n Bond listened to his imagination. It was like watching a film. The sleeping Darko, the man slipping quietly through the door, the two steps forward and the swift stroke at the jugular. Then the last violent spasm of the dying man as he flung up an arm and clutched his murderer to him and plunged the knife down towards the fifth rib.\\n\\n This wonderful man who had carried the sun with him. Now he was extinguished, totally dead.\\n\\n Bond turned brusquely and walked out of sight of the man who had died for him.\\n\\n He began, carefully, non-committally, to answer questions.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-Four\\n\\n Out of Danger?\\n\\n The Orient Express steamed slowly into Belgrade at three o\u0027clock in the afternoon, half an hour late. There would be an eight hours\u0027 delay while the other section of the train came in through the Iron Curtain from Bulgaria. Bond looked out at the crowds and waited for the knock on the door that would be Kerim\u0027s man. Tatiana sat huddled in her sable coat beside the door, watching Bond, wondering if he would come back to her.\\n\\n She had seen it all from the window–the long wicker baskets being brought out to the train, the flash of the police photographer\u0027s bulbs, the gesticulating chef de train trying to hurry up the formalities, and the tall figure of James Bond, straight and hard and cold as a butcher\u0027s knife, coming and going.\\n\\n Bond had come back and had sat looking at her. He had asked sharp, brutal questions. She had fought desperately back, sticking coldly to her story, knowing that now, if she told him everything, told him for instance that SMERSH was involved, she would certainly lose him for ever.\\n\\n Now she sat and was afraid, afraid of the web in which she was caught, afraid of what might have been behind the lies she had been told in Moscow–above all afraid that she might lose this man who had suddenly become the light in her life.\\n\\n There was a knock on the door. Bond got up and opened it. A tough cheerful india-rubbery man, with Kerim\u0027s blue eyes and a mop of tangled fair hair above a brown face, exploded into the compartment.\\n\\n \u0027Stefan Trempo at your service,\u0027 the big smile embraced them both. \u0027They call me \u0027\u0027Tempo\u0027\u0027. Where is the Chef?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sit down,\u0027 said Bond. He thought to himself, I know it. This is another of Darko\u0027s sons.\\n\\n The man looked sharply at them both. He sat down carefully between them. His face was extinguished. Now the bright eyes stared at Bond with a terrible intensity in which there was fear and suspicion. His right hand slipped casually into the pocket of his coat.\\n\\n When Bond had finished, the man stood up. He didn\u0027t ask any questions. He said \u0027Thank you, sir. Will you come, please. We will go to my apartment. There is much to be done.\u0027 He walked into the corridor and stood with his back to them, looking out across the rails. When the girl came out he walked down the corridor without looking back. Bond followed the girl, carrying the heavy bag and his little attaché case.\\n\\n They walked down the platform and into the station square. It had started to drizzle. The scene, with its sprinkling of battered taxis and vista of dull modern buildings, was depressing. The man opened the rear door of a shabby Morris Oxford saloon. He got in front and took the wheel. They bumped their way over the cobbles and on to a slippery tarmac boulevard and drove for a quarter of an hour through wide, empty streets. They saw few pedestrians and not more than a handful of other cars.\\n\\n They stopped half way down a cobbled side-street. Tempo led them through a wide apartment-house door and up two flights of stairs that had the smell of the Balkans–the smell of very old sweat and cigarette smoke and cabbage. He unlocked a door and showed them into a two-roomed flat with nondescript furniture and heavy red plush curtains drawn back to show the blank windows on the other side of the street. On a sideboard stood a tray with several unopened bottles, glasses and plates of fruit and biscuits–the welcome to Darko and to Darko\u0027s friends.\\n\\n Tempo waved vaguely towards the drinks. \u0027Please sir, make yourself and Madam at home. There is a bathroom. No doubt you would both like to have a bath. If you will excuse me, I must telephone!\u0027 The hard facade of the face was about to crumble. The man went quickly into the bedroom and shut the door behind him.\\n\\n There followed two empty hours during which Bond sat and looked out of the window at the wall opposite. From time to time he got up and paced to and fro and then sat down again. For the first hour, Tatiana sat and pretended to look through a pile of magazines. Then she abruptly went into the bathroom and Bond vaguely heard water gushing into the bath.\\n\\n At about 6 o\u0027clock, Tempo came out of the bedroom. He told Bond that he was going out. \u0027There is food in the kitchen. I will return at nine and take you to the train. Please treat my flat as your own.\u0027 Without waiting for Bond\u0027s reply, he walked out and softly shut the door. Bond heard his foot on the stairs and the click of the front door and the self-starter of the Morris.\\n\\n Bond went into the bedroom and sat on the bed and picked up the telephone and talked in German to the long-distance exchange.\\n\\n Half an hour later there was the quiet voice of M.\\n\\n Bond spoke as a travelling salesman would speak to the managing director :°f Universal Export. He said that his partner had gone very sick. Were there any fresh instructions?\\n\\n \u0027Very sick?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir, very.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How about the other firm?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There were three with us, sir. One of them caught the same thing. The other two didn\u0027t feel well on the way out of Turkey. They left us at Uzunkopru–that\u0027s the frontier.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So the other firm\u0027s packed up?\u0027\\n\\n Bond could see M\u0027s face as he sifted the information. He wondered if the fan was slowly revolving in the ceiling, if M had a pipe in his hand, if the Chief of Staff was listening on the other wire. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-30.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \\n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
