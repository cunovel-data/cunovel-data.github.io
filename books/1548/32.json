{"id":107382,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"Was there defensiveness in the voice? Bond glanced sideways. The pale eyes swivelled to meet his. There was a quick red glare in them. It was as if the safety door of a furnace had swung open. The blaze died. The door to the inside of the man was banged shut. Now the eyes were opaque again–the eyes of an introvert, of a man who rarely looks out into the world but is for ever surveying the scene inside him.\\n\\n There\u0027s madness there all right, thought Bond, startled by the sight of it. Shell-shock perhaps, or schizophrenia. Poor chap, with that magnificent body. One day he would certainly crack. The madness would take control. Bond had better have a word to Personnel. Check up on his medical. By the way, what was his name?\\n\\n \u0027Well I\u0027m very glad to have you along. Probably not much for you to do. We started off with three Redland men on our tail. They\u0027ve been got rid of, but there may be others on the train. Or some more may get on. And I\u0027ve got to get this girl to London without trouble. If you\u0027d just hang about. Tonight we\u0027d better stay together and share watches. It\u0027s the last night and I don\u0027t want to take any chances. By the way, my name\u0027s James Bond. Travelling as David Somerset. And that\u0027s Caroline Somerset in there.\u0027\\n\\n The man fished in his inside pocket and produced a battered note-case which seemed to contain plenty of money. He extracted a visiting card and handed it to Bond. It said \u0027Captain Norman Nash\u0027, and in the left-hand bottom corner, \u0027Royal Automobile Club\u0027.\\n\\n As Bond put the card in his pocket he slipped his finger across it. It was engraved. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he said. \u0027Well, Nash, come and meet Mrs Somerset. No reason why we shouldn\u0027t travel more or less together.\u0027 He smiled encouragingly.\\n\\n Again the red glare quickly extinguished. The lips writhed under the young golden moustache. \u0027Delighted, old man.\u0027\\n\\n Bond turned to the door and knocked softly and spoke his name.\\n\\n The door opened. Bond beckoned Nash in and shut the door behind him.\\n\\n The girl looked surprised.\\n\\n \u0027This is Captain Nash, Norman Nash. He\u0027s been told to keep an eye on us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you do.\u0027 The hand came out hesitantly. The man touched it briefly. His stare was fixed. He said nothing. The girl gave an embarrassed little laugh, \u0027Won\u0027t you sit down?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er, thank you.\u0027 Nash sat stiffly on the edge of the banquette. He seemed to remember something, something one did when one had nothing to say. He groped in the side pocket of his coat and produced a packet of Players. \u0027Will you have a, er, cigarette?\u0027 He prised open the top with a fairly clean thumb nail, stripped down the silver paper and pushed out the cigarettes. The girl took one. Nash\u0027s other hand flashed forward a lighter with the obsequious speed of a motor salesman.\\n\\n Nash looked up. Bond was standing leaning against the door and wondering how to help this clumsy, embarrassed man. Nash held out the cigarettes and the lighter as if he was offering glass beads to a native chief. \u0027What about you, old man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Bond. He hated Virginia tobacco, but he was prepared to do anything to help put the man at ease. He took a cigarette and lit it. They certainly had to make do with some queer fish in the Service nowadays. How the devil did this man manage to get along in the semi-diplomatic society he would have to frequent in Trieste?\\n\\n Bond said lamely. \u0027You look very fit, Nash. Tennis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Swimming.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Been long in Trieste?\u0027\\n\\n There came a brief red glare. \u0027About three years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Interesting work?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes. You know how it is, old man.\u0027\\n\\n Bond wondered how he could stop Nash calling him \u0027old man\u0027. He couldn\u0027t think of a way. Silence fell.\\n\\n Nash obviously felt it was his turn again. He fished in his pocket and produced a newspaper cutting. It was the front page of the Corrière della Sera. He handed it to Bond. \u0027Seen this, old man?\u0027 The eyes blazed and died.\\n\\n It was the front page lead. The thick black lettering on the cheap newsprint was still wet. The headlines said:\\n\\n TERRIBLE ESPLOSIONE IN ISTANBUL\\n\\n UFFICIO SOVIETICO DISTRUTTO\\n\\n TUTTI I PRESENTI UCCISI\\n\\n Bond couldn\u0027t understand the rest. He folded the cutting and handed it back. How much did this man know? Better treat him as a strong-man arm and nothing else. \u0027Bad show,\u0027 he said. \u0027Gas main I suppose.\u0027 Bond saw again the obscene belly of the bomb hanging down from the roof of the alcove in the tunnel, the wires that started off down the damp wall on their way back to the plunger in the drawer of Kerim\u0027s desk. Who had pressed the plunger yesterday afternoon when Tempo had got through? The \u0027Head Clerk\u0027? Or had they drawn lots and then stood round and watched as the hand went down and the deep roar had gone up in the Street of Books on the hill above. They would all have been there, in the cool room. With eyes that glittered with hate. The tears would be reserved for the night. Revenge would have come first. And the rats? How many thousand had been blasted down the tunnel? What time would it have been? About four o\u0027clock. Had the daily meeting been on? Three dead in the room. How many more in the rest of the building? Friends of Tatiana, perhaps. He would have to keep the story from her. Had Darko been watching? From a window in Valhalla? Bond could hear the great laugh of triumph echoing round its walls. At any rate Kerim had taken plenty with him.\\n\\n Nash was looking at him. \u0027Yes, I daresay it was a gas main,\u0027 he said without interest.\\n\\n A hand-bell tinkled down the corridor coming nearer. \u0027Deuxième Service. Deuxième Service. Prenez vos places, s\u0027il vous plait.\u0027\\n\\n Bond looked across at Tatiana. Her face was pale. In her eyes there was an appeal to be saved from any more of this clumsy, non-kulturny man. Bond said, \u0027What about lunch?\u0027 She got up at once. \u0027What about you, Nash?\u0027\\n\\n Captain Nash was already on his feet. \u0027Had it, thanks old man. And I\u0027d like to have a look up and down the train. Is the conductor–you know . . .?\u0027 he made a gesture of fingering money.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes, he\u0027ll co-operate all right,\u0027 said Bond. He reached up and pulled down the heavy little bag. He opened the door for Nash. \u0027See you later.\u0027\\n\\n Captain Nash stepped into the corridor. He said, \u0027Yes I expect so, old man.\u0027 He turned left and strode off down the corridor, moving easily with the swaying of the train, his hands in his trouser pockets and the light blazing on the tight golden curls at the back of his head.\\n\\n Bond followed Tatiana up the train. The carriages were crowded with holiday-makers going home. In the third-class corridors people sat on their bags chattering and munching at oranges and at hard-looking rolls with bits of Salami sticking out of them. The men carefully examined Tatiana as she squeezed by. The women looked appraisingly at Bond, wondering whether he made love to her well.\\n\\n In the restaurant car, Bond ordered Americanos and a bottle of Chianti Broglio. The wonderful European hors d\u0027oeuvres came. Tatiana began to look more cheerful.\\n\\n \u0027Funny sort of man,\u0027 Bond watched her pick about among the little dishes. \u0027But I\u0027m glad he\u0027s come along. I\u0027ll have a chance to get some sleep. I\u0027m going to sleep for a week when we get home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do not like him,\u0027 the girl said indifferently. \u0027He is not kulturny. I do not trust his eyes.\u0027\\n\\n Bond laughed. \u0027Nobody\u0027s kulturny enough for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you know him before?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. But he belongs to my firm.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did you say his name is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nash. Norman Nash.\u0027\\n\\n She spelled it out. \u0027N.A.S.H.? Like that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n The girl\u0027s eyes were puzzled. \u0027I suppose you know what that means in Russian. Nash means \u0027\u0027ours\u0027\u0027. In our Services, a man is nash when he is one of \u0027\u0027our\u0027\u0027 men. He is svoi when he is one of \u0027\u0027theirs\u0027\u0027–when he belongs to the enemy. And this man calls himself Nash. That is not pleasant.\u0027\\n\\n Bond laughed. \u0027Really, Tania. You do think of extraordinary reasons for not liking people. Nash is quite a common English name. He\u0027s perfectly harmless. At any rate he\u0027s tough enough for what we want him for.\u0027\\n\\n Tatiana made a face. She went on with her lunch.\\n\\n Some tagliatelli verdi came, and the wine, and then a delicious escalope. \u0027Oh it is so good,\u0027 she said. \u0027Since I came out of Russia I am all stomach.\u0027 Her eyes widened. \u0027You won\u0027t let me get too fat, James. You won\u0027t let me get so fat that I am no use for making love? You will have to be careful, or I shall just eat all day long and sleep. You will beat me if I eat too much?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly I will beat you.\u0027\\n\\n Tatiana wrinkled her nose. He felt the soft caress of her ankles. The wide eyes looked at him hard. The lashes came down demurely. \u0027Please pay,\u0027 she said. \u0027I feel sleepy.\u0027\\n\\n The train was pulling into Maestre. There was the beginning of the canals. A cargo gondola full of vegetables was moving slowly along a straight sheet of water into the town.\\n\\n \u0027But we shall be coming into Venice in a minute,\u0027 protested Bond. \u0027Don\u0027t you want to see it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It will be just another station. And I can see Venice another day. Now Iwant you to love me. Please, James.\u0027 Tatiana leaned forward. She put a hand over his. \u0027Give me what I want. There is so little time.\u0027\\n\\n Then it was the little room again and the smell of the sea coming through the half-open window and the drawn blind fluttering with the wind of the train. Again there were the two piles of clothes on the floor, and the two whispering bodies on the banquette, and the slow searching hands. And the love-knot formed, and, as the train jolted over the points into the echoing | station of Venice, there came the final lost despairing cry.\\n\\n Outside the vacuum of the tiny room there sounded a confusion of echoing calls and metallic clanging and shuffling footsteps that slowly faded into sleep.\\n\\n Padua came, and Vicenza, and a fabulous sunset over Verona flickered gold and red through the cracks of the blind. Again the little bell came tinkling down the corridor. They woke. Bond dressed and went into the corridor and leant against the guard rail. He looked out at the fading pink light over the Lombardy Plain and thought of Tatiana and of the future.\\n\\n Nash\u0027s face slid up alongside his in the dark glass. Nash came very close so that his elbow touched Bond\u0027s. \u0027I think I\u0027ve spotted one of the oppo, old man,\u0027 he said softly.\\n\\n Bond was not surprised. He had assumed that, if it came, it would come tonight. Almost indifferently he said, \u0027Who is he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know what his real name is, but he\u0027s been through Trieste once or twice. Something to do with Albania. May be the Resident Director there. Now he\u0027s on an American passport. \u0027\u0027Wilbur Frank.\u0027\u0027 Calls himself a banker. In No. 9, right next to you. I don\u0027t think I could be wrong about him, old man.\u0027\\n\\n Bond glanced at the eyes in the big brown face. Again the furnace door was ajar. The red glare shone out and was extinguished.\\n\\n \u0027Good thing you spotted him. This may be a tough night. You\u0027d better stick by us from now on. We mustn\u0027t leave the girl alone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I thought, old man.\u0027\\n\\n They had dinner. It was a silent meal. Nash sat beside the girl and kept his eyes on his plate. He held his knife like a fountain pen and frequently wiped it on his fork. He was clumsy in his movements. Half way through the meal, he reached for the salt and knocked over Tatiana\u0027s glass of Chianti. He apologized profusely. He made a great show of calling for another glass and filling it.\\n\\n Coffee came. Now it was Tatiana who was clumsy. She knocked over her cup. She had gone very pale and her breath was coming quickly.\\n\\n \u0027Tatiana!\u0027 Bond half rose to his feet. But it was Captain Nash who jumped up and took charge.\\n\\n \u0027Lady\u0027s come over queer,\u0027 he said shortly. \u0027Allow me.\u0027 He reached down and put an arm round the girl and lifted her to her feet. Til take her back to the compartment. You\u0027d better look after the bag. And there\u0027s the bill. I can take care of her till you come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is all right,\u0027 protested Tatiana with the slack lips of deepening unconsciousness. \u0027Don\u0027 worry, James, I lie down.\u0027 Her head lolled against Nash\u0027s shoulder. Nash put one thick arm round her waist and manoeuvred her quickly and efficiently down the crowded aisle and out of the restaurant car. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-32.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \\n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
