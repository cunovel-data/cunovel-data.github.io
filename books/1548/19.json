{"id":107370,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"The head clerk, who seemed to be some sort of chief-of-staff to Kerim, led Bond through another door in the wall of the raised platform. The heads were still bowed over the ledgers. There was a short passage with rooms on either side. The man led the way into one of these and Bond found himself in an extremely well-equipped dark-room and laboratory. In ten minutes he was out again on the street. The Rolls edged out of the narrow alley and back again on to the Galata Bridge.\n A new concierge was on duty at the Kristal Palas, a small obsequious man with guilty eyes in a yellow face. He came out from behind the desk, his hands spread in apology. \u0027Effendi, I greatly regret. My colleague showed you to an inadequate room. It was not realized that you are a friend of Kerim Bey. Your things have been moved to No. 12. It is the best room in the hotel. In fact,\u0027 the concierge leered, \u0027it is the room reserved for honeymoon couples. Every comfort. My apologies, Effendi. The other room is not intended for visitors of distinction.\u0027 The man executed an oily bow, washing his hands.\n If there was one thing Bond couldn\u0027t stand it was the sound of his boots being licked. He looked the concierge in the eyes and said, \u0027Oh.\u0027 The eyes slid away. \u0027Let me see this room. I may not like it. I was quite comfortable where I was.\u0027\n \u0027Certainly, Effendi,\u0027 the man bowed Bond to the lift. \u0027But alas the plumbers are in your former room. The water supply . . . .\u0027 the voice trailed away. The lift rose about ten feet and stopped at the first floor.\n Well, the story of the plumbers makes sense, reflected Bond. And, after all, there was no harm in having the best room in the hotel.\n The concierge unlocked a high door and stood back.\n Bond had to approve. The sun streamed in through wide double windows that gave on to a small balcony. The motif was pink and grey and the style was mock French Empire, battered by the years, but still with all the elegance of the turn of the century. There were fine Bokhara rugs on the parquet floor. A glittering chandelier hung from the ornate ceiling. The bed against the right-hand wall was huge. A large mirror in a gold frame covered most of the wall behind it. (Bond was amused. The honeymoon room! Surely there should be a mirror on the ceiling as well.) The adjoining bathroom was tiled and fitted with everything, including a bidet and a shower. Bond\u0027s shaving things were neatly laid out.\n The concierge followed Bond back into the bedroom, and when Bond said he would take the room, bowed himself gratefully out.\n Why not? Bond again walked round the room. This time he carefully inspected the walls and the neighbourhood of the bed and the telephone. Why not take the room? Why would there be microphones or secret doors? What would be the point of them?\n His suitcase was on a bench near the chest-of-drawers. He knelt down. No scratches round the lock. The bit of fluff he had trapped in the clasp was still there. He unlocked the suitcase and took out the little attach√© case. Again no signs of interference. Bond locked the case and got to his feet.\n He washed and went out of the room and down the stairs. No, there had been no messages for the Effendi. The concierge bowed as he opened the door of the Rolls. Was there a hint of conspiracy behind the permanent guilt in those eyes? Bond decided not to care if there was. The game, whatever it was, had to be played out. If the change of rooms had been the opening gambit, so much the better. The game had to begin somewhere.\n As the car sped back down the hill, Bond\u0027s thoughts turned to Darko Kerim. What a man for Head of Station T! His size alone, in this country of furtive, stunted little men, would give him authority, and his giant vitality and love of life would make everyone his friend. Where had this exuberant shrewd pirate come from? And how had he come to work for the Service? He was the rare type of man that Bond loved, and Bond already felt prepared to add Kerim to the half-dozen of those real friends whom Bond, who had no \u0027acquaintances\u0027, would be ready to take to his heart.\n The car went back over the Galata Bridge and drew up outside the vaulted arcades of the Spice Bazaar. The chauffeur led the way up the shallow worn steps and into the fog of exotic scents, shouting curses at the beggars and sack-laden porters. Inside the entrance the chauffeur turned left out of the steam of shuffling, jabbering humanity and showed Bond a small arch in the thick wall. Turret-like stone steps curled upwards.\n \u0027Effendi, you will find Kerim Bey in the far room on the left. You have only to ask. He is known to all.\u0027\n Bond climbed the cool stairs to a small anteroom where a waiter, without asking his name, took charge and led him through a maze of small, colourfully tiled, vaulted rooms to where Kerim was sitting at a corner table over the entrance to the bazaar. Kerim greeted him boisterously, waving a glass of milky liquid in which ice tinkled.\n \u0027Here you are my friend! Now, at once, some raki. You must be exhausted after your sight-seeing.\u0027 He fired orders at the waiter.\n Bond sat down in a comfortable-armed chair and took the small tumbler the waiter offered him. He lifted it towards Kerim and tasted it. It was identical with ouzo. He drank it down. At once the waiter refilled his glass.\n \u0027And now to order your lunch. They eat nothing but offal cooked in rancid olive oil in Turkey. At least the offal at the Misir Carsarsi is the best.\u0027\n The grinning waiter made suggestions.\n \u0027He says the Doner Kebab is very good today. I don\u0027t believe him, but it can be. It is very young lamb broiled over charcoal with savoury rice. Lots of onions in it. Or is there anything you prefer? A pilaff or some of those damned stuffed peppers they eat here? All right then. And you must start with a few sardines grilled en papillotte. They are just edible.\u0027 Kerim harangued the waiter. He sat back, smiling at Bond. \u0027That is the only way to treat these damned people. They love to be cursed and kicked. It is all they understand. It is in the blood. All this pretence of democracy is killing them. They want some sultans and wars and rape and fun. Poor brutes, in their striped suits and bowler hats. They are miserable. You\u0027ve only got to look at them. However, to hell with them all. Any news?\u0027\n Bond shook his head. He told Kerim about the change of room and the untouched suitcase.\n Kerim downed a glass of raki and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand. He echoed the thought Bond had had. \u0027Well, the game must begin sometime. I have made certain small moves. Now we can only wait and see. We will make a little foray into enemy territory after lunch. I think it will interest you. Oh, we shan\u0027t be seen. We shall move in the shadows, underground.\u0027 Kerim laughed delightedly at his cleverness. \u0027And now let us talk about other things. How do you like Turkey? No, I don\u0027t want to know. What else?\u0027\n They were interrupted by the arrival of their first course. Bond\u0027s sardines en papillotte tasted like any other fried sardines. Kerim set about a large plate of what appeared to be strips of raw fish. He saw Bond\u0027s look of interest. \u0027Raw fish,\u0027 he said. \u0027After this I shall have raw meat and lettuce and then I shall have a bowl of yoghourt. I am not a faddist, but I once trained to be a professional strong man. It is a good profession in Turkey. The public loves them. And my trainer insisted that I should eat only raw food. I got the habit. It is good for me, but,\u0027 he waved his fork, \u0027I do not pretend it is good for everyone. I don\u0027t care the hell what other people eat so long as they enjoy it. I can\u0027t stand sad eaters and sad drinkers.\u0027\n \u0027Why did you decide not to be a strong man? How did you get into this racket?\u0027\n Kerim forked up a strip of fish and tore at it with his teeth. He drank down half a tumbler of raki. He lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said with a sour grin, \u0027we might as well talk about me as about anything else. And you must be wondering \u0027\u0027How did this big crazy man get into the Service?\u0027\u0027 I will tell you, but briefly, because it is a long story. You will stop me if you get bored. All right?\u0027\n \u0027Fine.\u0027 Bond lit a Diplomate. He leant forward on his elbows.\n \u0027I come from Trebizond.\u0027 Kerim watched his cigarette smoke curl upwards. \u0027We were a huge family with many mothers. My father was the sort of man women can\u0027t resist. All women want to be swept off their feet. In their dreams they long to be slung over a man\u0027s shoulder and taken into a cave and raped. That was his way with them. My father was a great fisherman and his fame was spread all over the Black Sea. He went after the sword-fish. They are difficult to catch and hard to fight and he would always outdo all others after these fish. Women like their men to be heroes. He was a kind of hero in a corner of Turkey where it is a tradition for the men to be tough. He was a big, romantic sort of fellow. So he could have any woman he wanted. He wanted them all and sometimes killed other men to get them. Naturally he had many children. We all lived on top of each other in a great rambling old ruin of a house that our \u0027\u0027aunts\u0027\u0027 made habitable. The aunts really amounted to a harem. One of them was an English governess from Istanbul my father had seen watching a circus. He took a fancy to her and she to him and that evening he put her on board his fishing boat and sailed up the Bosphorus and back to Trebizond. I don\u0027t think she ever regretted it. I think she forgot all the world except him. She died just after the war. She was sixty. The child before me had been by an Italian girl and the girl had called him Bianco. He was fair. I was dark. I got to be called Darko. There were fifteen of us children and we had a wonderful childhood. Our aunts fought often and so did we. It was like a gipsy encampment. It was held together by my father who thrashed us, women or children, when we were a nuisance. But he was good to us when we were peaceful and obedient. You cannot understand such a family?\u0027\n \u0027The way you describe it I can.\u0027\n \u0027Anyway so it was. I grew up to be nearly as big a man as my father, but better educated. My mother saw to that. My father only taught us to be clean and to go to the lavatory once a day and never to feel shame about anything in the world. My mother also taught me a regard for England, but that is by the way. By the time I was twenty, I had a boat of my own and I was making money. But I was wild. I left the big house and went to live in two small rooms on the waterfront. I wanted to have my women where my mother would not know. There was a stroke of bad luck. I had a little Bessarabian hell-cat. I had won her in a fight with some gipsies, here in the hills behind Istanbul. They came after me, but I got her on board the boat. I had to knock her unconscious first. She was still trying to kill me when we got back to Trebizond, so I got her to my place and took away all her clothes and kept her chained naked under the table. When I ate, I used to throw scraps to her under the table, like a dog. She had to learn who was master. Before that could happen, my mother did an unheard of thing. She visited my place without warning. She came to tell me that my father wanted to see me immediately. She found the girl. My mother was really angry with me for the first time in my life. Angry? She was beside herself. I was a cruel ne\u0027er-do-well and she was ashamed to call me son. The girl must immediately be taken back to her people. My mother brought her some of her own clothes from the house. The girl put them on, but when the time came, she refused to leave me.\u0027 Darko Kerim laughed hugely. \u0027An interesting lesson in female psychology my dear friend. However, the problem of the girl is another story. While my mother was fussing over her and getting nothing but gipsy curses for her pains, I was having an interview with my father, who had heard nothing of all this and who never did hear. My mother was like that. There was another man with my father, a tall, quiet Englishman with a black patch over one eye. They were talking about the Russians. The Englishman wanted to know what they were doing along their frontier, about what was going on at Batoum, their big oil and naval base only fifty miles away from Trebizond. He would pay good money for information. I knew English and I knew Russian. I had good eyes and ears. I had a boat. My father had decided that I would work for the Englishman. And that Englishman, my dear friend, was Major Dansey, my predecessor as Head of this Station. And the rest,\u0027 Kerim made a wide gesture with his cigarette holder, \u0027you can imagine.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-19.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
