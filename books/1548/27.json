{"id":107377,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Bond looked casually up. Two small cases were on the rack beside his suitcase. He took her hand. He said, \u0027Thank God you\u0027re safe.\u0027 Something in his eyes, perhaps the flash of guilt, as he admitted to himself that he had been more interested in the girl than the machine, reassured her. She kept his hand in hers and sank contentedly back in her corner. The train screeched slowly round Seraglio Point. The lighthouse lit up the roofs of the dreary shacks along the railway line. With his free hand Bond took out a cigarette and lit it. He reflected that they would soon be passing the back of the great billboard where Krilencu had lived–until less than twenty-four hours ago. Bond saw again the scene in every detail. The white cross roads, the two men in the shadows, the doomed man slipping out through the purple lips. The girl watched his face with tenderness. What was this man thinking? What was going on behind those cold level grey-blue eyes that sometimes turned soft and sometimes, as they had done last night before his passion had burned out in her arms, blazed like diamonds. Now they were veiled in thought. Was he worrying about them both? Worrying about their safety? If only she could tell him that there was nothing to fear, that he was only her passport to England–him and the heavy case the Resident Director had given her that evening in the office. The Director had said the same thing. \u0027Here is your passport to England, Corporal,\u0027 he had said cheerfully. \u0027Look.\u0027 He had unzipped the bag: \u0027A brand new Spektor. Be certain not to open the bag again or let it out of your compartment until you get to the other end. Or this Englishman will take it away from you and throw you on the dust-heap. It is this machine they want. Do not let them take it from you, or you will have failed in your duty. Understood?\u0027 A signal box loomed up in the blue dusk outside the window. Tatiana watched Bond get up and pull down the window and crane out into the darkness. His body was close to her. She moved her knee so that it touched him. How extraordinary, this passionate tenderness that had filled her ever since she had seen him last night standing naked at the window, his arms up to hold the curtains back, his profile, under the tousled black hair, intent and pale in the moonlight. And then the extraordinary fusing of their eyes and their bodies. The flame that had suddenly lit between them–between the two secret agents, thrown together from enemy camps a whole world apart, each involved in his own plot against the country of the other, antagonists by profession, yet turned, and by the orders of their governments, into lovers. Tatiana stretched out a hand and caught hold of the edge of the coat and tugged at it. Bond pulled up the window and turned. He smiled down at her. He read her eyes. He bent and put his hands on the fur over her breasts and kissed her hard on the lips. Tatiana leant back, dragging him with her. There came a soft double knock on the door. Bond stood up. He pulled out his handkerchief and brusquely scrubbed the rouge off his lips. \u0027That\u0027ll be my friend Kerim,\u0027 he said. \u0027I must talk to him. I will tell the conductor to make up the beds. Stay here while he does it. I won\u0027t be long. I shall be outside the door.\u0027 He leant forward and touched her hand and looked at her wide eyes and at her rueful, half-open lips. \u0027We shall have all the night to ourselves. First I must see that you are safe.\u0027 He unlocked the door and slipped out. Darko Kerim\u0027s huge bulk was blocking the corridor. He was leaning on the brass guard-rail, smoking and gazing moodily out towards the Sea of Marmara that receded as the long train snaked away from the coast and turned inland and northwards. Bond leaned on the rail beside him. Kerim looked into the reflection of Bond\u0027s face in the dark window. He said softly, \u0027The news is not good. There are three of them on the train.\u0027 \u0027Ah!\u0027 An electric tingle ran up Bond\u0027s spine. \u0027It\u0027s the three strangers we saw in that room. Obviously they\u0027re on to you and the girl.\u0027 Kerim glanced sharply sideways. \u0027That makes her a double. Or doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Bond\u0027s mind was cool. So the girl had been bait. And yet, and yet. No, damn it. She couldn\u0027t be acting. It wasn\u0027t possible. The cipher machine? Perhaps after all it wasn\u0027t in that bag. \u0027Wait a minute,\u0027 he said. He turned and knocked softly on the door. He heard her unlock it and slip the chain. He went in and shut the door. She looked surprised. She had thought it was the conductor come to make up the beds. She smiled radiantly. \u0027You have finished?\u0027 \u0027Sit down, Tatiana. I\u0027ve got to talk to you.\u0027 Now she saw the coldness in his face and her smile went out. She sat down obediently with her hands in her lap. Bond stood over her. Was there guilt in her face, or fear? No, only surprise and a coolness to match his own expression. \u0027Now listen, Tatiana,\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was deadly. \u0027Something\u0027s come up. I must look into that bag and see if the machine is there.\u0027 She said indifferently. \u0027Take it down and look.\u0027 She examined the hands in her lap. So now it was going to come. What the Director had said. They were going to take the machine and throw her aside, perhaps have her put off the train. Oh God! This man was going to do that to her. Bond reached up and hauled down the heavy case and put it on the seat. He tore the zip sideways and looked in. Yes, a grey japanned metal case with three rows of squat keys, rather like a typewriter. He held the bag open towards her. \u0027Is that a Spektor?\u0027 She glanced casually into the gaping bag. \u0027Yes.\u0027 Bond zipped the bag shut and put it back on the rack. He sat down beside the girl. \u0027There are three M.G.B. men on the train. We know they are the ones who arrived at your centre on Monday. What are they doing here, Tatiana?\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was soft. He watched her, searched her with all his senses. She looked up. There were tears in her eyes. Were they the tears of a child found out? But there was no trace of guilt in her face. She only looked terrified of something. She reached out a hand and then drew it back. \u0027You aren\u0027t going to throw me off the train now you\u0027ve got the machine?\u0027 \u0027Of course not,\u0027 Bond said impatiently. \u0027Don\u0027t be idiotic. But we must know what these men are doing. What\u0027s it all about? Did you know they were going to be on the train?\u0027 He tried to read some clue in her expression. He could only see a great relief. And what else? A look of calculation? Or reserve? Yes, she was hiding something. But what? Tatiana seemed to make up her mind. Brusquely she wiped the back of her hand across her eyes. She reached forward and put the hand on his knee. The streak of tears showed on the back of the hand. She looked into Bond\u0027s eyes, forcing him to believe her. \u0027James,\u0027 she said. \u0027I did not know these men were on the train. I was told they were leaving today. For Germany. I assumed they would fly. That is all I can tell you. Until we arrive in England, out of reach of my people, you must not ask me more. I have done what I said I would. I am here with the machine. Have faith in me. Do not be afraid for us. I am certain these men do not mean us harm. Absolutely certain. Have faith.\u0027 (Was she so certain, wondered Tatiana? Had the Klebb woman told her all the truth? But she also must have faith–faith in the orders she had been given. These men must be the guards to see that she didn\u0027t get off the train. They could mean no harm. Later, when they got to London, this man would hide her away out of reach of SMERSH and she would tell him everything he wanted to know. She had already decided this in the back of her mind. But God knew what would happen if she betrayed Them now. They would somehow get her, and him. She knew it. There were no secrets from these people. And They would have no mercy. So long as she played out her role, all would be well.) Tatiana watched Bond\u0027s face for a sign that he believed her. Bond shrugged his shoulders. He stood up. \u0027I don\u0027t know what to think, Tatiana,\u0027 he said. \u0027You are keeping something from me, but I think it\u0027s something you don\u0027t know is important. And I believe you think we are safe. We may be. It may be a coincidence that these men are on the train. I must talk to Kerim and decide what to do. Don\u0027t worry. We will look after you. But now we must be very careful.\u0027 Bond looked round the compartment. He tried the communicating door with the next coupe. It was locked. He decided to wedge it when the conductor had gone. He would do the same for the door into the passage. And he would have to stay awake. So much for the honeymoon on wheels! Bond smiled grimly to himself and rang for the conductor. Tatiana was looking anxiously up at him. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Tania,\u0027 he said again. \u0027Don\u0027t worry about anything. Go to bed when the man has gone. Don\u0027t open the door unless you know it\u0027s me. I will sit up tonight and watch. Perhaps tomorrow it will be easier. I will make a plan with Kerim. He is a good man.\u0027 The conductor knocked. Bond let him in and went out into the corridor. Kerim was still there gazing out. The train had picked up speed and was hurtling through the night, its harsh melancholy whistle echoing back at them from the walls of a deep cutting against the sides of which the lighted carriage windows flickered and danced. Kerim didn\u0027t move, but his eyes in the mirror of the window were watchful. Bond told him of the conversation. It was not easy to explain to Kerim why he trusted the girl as he did. He watched the mouth in the window curl ironically as he tried to describe what he had read in her eyes and what his intuition told him. Kerim sighed resignedly. \u0027James,\u0027 he said, \u0027you are now in charge. This is your part of the operation. We have already argued most of this out today–the danger of the train, the possibility of getting the machine home in the diplomatic bag, the integrity, or otherwise, of this girl. It certainly appears that she has surrendered unconditionally to you. At the same time you admit that you have surrendered to her. Perhaps only partially. But you have decided to trust her. In this morning\u0027s telephone talk with M he said that he would back your decision. He left it to you. So be it. But he didn\u0027t know we were to have an escort of three M.G.B. men. Nor did we. And I think that would have changed all our views. Yes?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Then the only thing to do is eliminate these three men. Get them off the train. God knows what they\u0027re here for. I don\u0027t believe in coincidences any more than you. But one thing is certain. We are not going to share the train with these men. Right?\u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 \u0027Then leave it to me. At least for tonight. This is still my country and I have certain powers in it. And plenty of money. I cannot afford to kill them. The train would be delayed. You and the girl might get involved. But I shall arrange something. Two of them have sleeping berths. The senior man with the moustache and the little pipe is next door to you–here, in No. 6.\u0027 He gestured backwards with his head. \u0027He is travelling on a German passport under the name of \u0027\u0027Melchior Benz, salesman\u0027\u0027. The dark one, the Armenian, is in No. 12. He, too, has a German passport–\u0027\u0027Kurt Goldfarb, construction engineer\u0027\u0027. They have through tickets to Paris. I have seen their documents. I have a police card. The conductor made no trouble. He has all the tickets and passports in his cabin. The third man, the man with a boil on the back of his neck, turns out also to have boils on his face. A stupid, ugly looking brute. I have not seen his passport. He is travelling sitting up in the first-class, in the next compartment to me. He does not have to surrender his passport until the frontier. But he has surrendered his ticket.\u0027 Like a conjuror, Kerim flicked a yellow first-class ticket out of his coat pocket. He slipped it back. He grinned proudly at Bond. \u0027How the hell?\u0027 Kerim chuckled. \u0027Before he settled down for the night, this dumb ox went to the lavatory. I was standing in the corridor and I suddenly remembered how we used to steal rides on the train when I was a boy. I gave him a minute. Then I walked up and rattled the lavatory door. I hung on to the handle very tight. \u0027\u0027Ticket collector,\u0027\u0027 I said in a loud voice. \u0027\u0027Tickets please.\u0027\u0027 I said it in French and again in German. There was a mumble from inside. I felt him try to open the door. I hung on tight so that he would think the door had stuck. \u0027\u0027Do not derange yourself, Monsieur\u0027\u0027 I said politely. \u0027\u0027Push the ticket under the door.\u0027\u0027 There was more fiddling with the door handle and I could hear heavy breathing. Then there was a pause and a rustle under the door. There was the ticket. I said, \u0027\u0027Merci, Monsieur\u0027\u0027 very politely. I picked up the ticket and stepped across the coupling into the next carriage.\u0027 Kerim airily waved a hand. \u0027The stupid oaf will be sleeping peacefully by now. He will think that his ticket will be given back to him at the frontier. He is mistaken. The ticket will be in ashes and the ashes will be on the four winds,\u0027 Kerim gestured towards the darkness outside. \u0027I will see that the man is put off the train, however much money he has got. He will be told that the circumstances must be investigated, his statements corroborated with the ticket agency. He will be allowed to proceed on a later train.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-27.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
