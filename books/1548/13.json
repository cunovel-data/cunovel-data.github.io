{"id":107364,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Suddenly, with terrific speed and the whole weight of her shoulder behind the blow, she whipped her right fist, loaded with a heavy brass knuckleduster, round and exactly into the solar plexus of the man. Whuck! Grant let out a snort of surprise and pain. His knees gave slightly, and then straightened. For a flash the eyes closed tight with agony. Then they opened again and glared redly down into the cold yellow probing eyes behind the square glasses. Apart from an angry flush on the skin just below the breast bone, Grant showed no ill effects from a blow that would have sent any normal man writhing to the ground. Rosa Klebb smiled grimly. She slipped the knuckle-duster back in her pocket and walked to her desk and sat down. She looked across at Kronsteen with a hint of pride. \u0027At least he is fit enough,\u0027 she said. Kronsteen grunted. The naked man grinned with sly satisfaction. He brought up one hand and rubbed his stomach. Rosa Klebb sat back in her chair and watched him thoughtfully. Finally she said, \u0027Comrade Granitsky, there is work for you. An important task. More important than anything you have attempted. It is a task that will earn you a medal\u0027–Grant\u0027s eyes gleamed–\u0027for the target is a difficult and dangerous one. You will be in a foreign country, and alone. Is that clear?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Grant was excited. Here was a chance for that big step forward. What would the medal be? The Order of Lenin? He listened carefully. \u0027The target is an English spy. You would like to kill an English spy?\u0027 \u0027Very much indeed, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Grant\u0027s enthusiasm was genuine. He asked nothing better than to kill an Englishman. He had accounts to settle with the bastards. \u0027You will need many weeks of training and preparation. On this assignment you will be operating in the guise of an English agent. Your manners and appearance are uncouth. You will have to learn at least some of the tricks,\u0027 the voice sneered, \u0027of a chentleman. You will be placed in the hands of a certain Englishman we have here. A former chentleman of the Foreign Office in London. It will be his task to make you pass as some sort of an English spy. They employ many different kinds of men. It should not be difficult. And you will have to learn many other things. The operation will be at the end of August, but you will start your training at once. There is much to be done. Put on your clothes and report back to the A.D.C. Understood?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Grant knew not to ask any questions. He scrambled into his clothes, indifferent to the woman\u0027s eyes on him, and walked over to the door, buttoning his jacket. He turned. \u0027Thank you, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Rosa Klebb was writing up her note of the interview. She didn\u0027t answer or look up and Grant went out and closed the door softly behind him. The woman threw down her pen and sat back. \u0027And now, Comrade Kronsteen. Are there any points to discuss before we put the full machinery in motion? I should mention that the Praesidium has approved the target and ratified the death warrant. I have reported the broad lines of your plan to Comrade General Grubozaboyschikov. He is in agreement. The detailed execution has been left entirely in my hands. The combined planning and operations staff has been selected and is waiting to begin work. Have you any last minute thoughts, Comrade?\u0027 Kronsteen sat looking up at the ceiling, the tips of his fingers joined in front of him. He was indifferent to the condescension in the woman\u0027s voice. The pulse of concentration beat in his temples. \u0027This man Granitsky. He is reliable? You can trust him in a foreign country? He will not go private?\u0027 \u0027He has been tested for nearly ten years. He had had many opportunities to escape. He has been watched for signs of itching feet. There has never been a breath of suspicion. The man is in the position of a drug addict. He would no more abandon the Soviet Union than a drugger would abandon the source of his cocaine. He is my top executioner. There is no one better.\u0027 \u0027And this girl, Romanova. She was satisfactory?\u0027 The woman said grudgingly, \u0027She is very beautiful. She will serve our purpose. She is not a virgin, but she is prudish and sexually unawakened. She will receive instruction. Her English is excellent. I have given her a certain version of her task and its object. She is co-operative. If she should show signs of faltering, I have the addresses of certain relatives, including children. I shall also have the names of her previous lovers. If necessary, it would be explained to her that these people will be hostages until her task is completed. She has an affectionate nature. Such a hint would be sufficient. But I do not anticipate any trouble from her.\u0027 \u0027Romanova. That is the name of a buivshi–of one of the former people. It seems odd to be using a Romanov for such a delicate task.\u0027 \u0027Her grandparents were distantly related to the Imperial Family. But she does not frequent buivshi circles. Anyway, all our grandparents were former people. There is nothing one can do about it.\u0027 \u0027Our grandparents were not called Romanov,\u0027 said Kronsteen dryly. \u0027However, so long as you are satisfied.\u0027 He reflected a moment. \u0027And this man Bond. Have we discovered his whereabouts?\u0027 \u0027Yes. The M.G.B. English network reports him in London. During the day, he goes to his headquarters. At night he sleeps in his flat in a district of London called Chelsea.\u0027 \u0027That is good. Let us hope he stays there for the next few weeks. That will mean that he is not engaged on some operation. He will be available to go after our bait when they get the scent. Meanwhile,\u0027 Kronsteen\u0027s dark, pensive eyes continued to examine a particular point on the ceiling, \u0027I have been studying the suitability of centres abroad. I have decided on Istanbul for the first contact. We have a good apparat there. The Secret Service has only a small station. The head of the station is reported to be a good man. He will be liquidated. The centre is conveniently placed for us, with short lines of communication with Bulgaria and the Black Sea. It is relatively far from London. I am working out details of the point of assassination and the means of getting this Bond there, after he has contacted the girl. It will be either in France or very near it. We have excellent leverage on the French press. They will make the most of this kind of story, with its sensational disclosures of sex and espionage. It also remains to be decided when Granitsky shall enter the picture. These are minor details. We must choose the cameramen and the other operatives and move them quietly into Istanbul. There must be no crowding of our apparat there, no congestion, no unusual activity. We will warn all departments that wireless traffic with Turkey is to be kept absolutely normal before and during the operation. We don\u0027t want the British interceptors smelling a rat. The Cipher Department has agreed that there is no Security objection to handing over the outer case of a Spektor machine. That will be attractive. The machine will go to the Special Devices section. They will handle its preparation.\u0027 Kronsteen stopped talking. His gaze slowly came down from the ceiling. He rose thoughtfully to his feet. He looked across and into the watchful, intent eyes of the woman. \u0027I can think of nothing else at the moment, Comrade,\u0027 he said. \u0027Many details will come up and have to be settled from day to day. But I think the operation can safely begin.\u0027 \u0027I agree, Comrade. The matter can now go forward. I will issue the necessary directives.\u0027 The harsh, authoritative voice unbent. \u0027I am grateful for your co-operation.\u0027 Kronsteen lowered his head one inch in acknowledgment. He turned and walked softly out of the room. In the silence, the Telekrypton gave a warning ping and started up its mechanical chatter. Rosa Klebb stirred in her chair and reached for one of the telephones. She dialled a number. \u0027Operations Room,\u0027 said a man\u0027s voice. Rosa Klebb\u0027s pale eyes, gazing out across the room, lit on the pink shape on the wall-map that was England. Her wet lips parted. \u0027Colonel Klebb speaking. The konspiratsia against the English spy Bond. The operation will commence forthwith.\u0027 Part Two THE EXECUTION Chapter Eleven The Soft Life The blubbery arms of the soft life had Bond round the neck and they were slowly strangling him. He was a man of war and when, for a long period, there was no war, his spirit went into a decline. In his particular line of business, peace had reigned for nearly a year. And peace was killing him. At 7.30 on the morning of Thursday, August 12th, Bond awoke in his comfortable flat in the plane-tree\u0027d square off the King\u0027s Road and was disgusted to find that he was thoroughly bored with the prospect of the day ahead. Just as, in at least one religion, accidie is the first of the cardinal sins, so boredom, and particularly the incredible circumstance of waking up bored, was the only vice Bond utterly condemned. Bond reached out and gave two rings on the bell to show May, his treasured Scottish housekeeper, that he was ready for breakfast. Then he abruptly flung the single sheet off his naked body and swung his feet to the floor. There was only one way to deal with boredom–kick oneself out of it. Bond went down on his hands and did twenty slow press-ups, lingering over each one so that his muscles had no rest. When his arms could stand the pain no longer, he rolled over on his back and, with his hands at his sides, did the straight leg-lift until his stomach muscles screamed. He got to his feet and, after touching his toes twenty times, went over to arm and chest exercises combined with deep breathing until he was dizzy. Panting with the exertion, he went into the big white-tiled bathroom and stood in the glass shower cabinet under very hot and then cold hissing water for five minutes. At last, after shaving and putting on a sleeveless dark blue Sea Island cotton shirt and navy blue tropical worsted trousers, he slipped his bare feet into black leather sandals and went through the bedroom into the long big-windowed sitting-room with the satisfaction of having sweated his boredom, at any rate for the time being, out of his body. May, an elderly Scotswoman with iron grey hair and a handsome closed face, came in with the tray and put it on the table in the bay window together with The Times, the only paper Bond ever read. Bond wished her good morning and sat down to breakfast. \u0027Good morning-s.\u0027 (To Bond, one of May\u0027s endearing qualities was that she would call no man \u0027sir\u0027 except–Bond had teased her about it years before–English kings and Winston Churchill. As a mark of exceptional regard, she accorded Bond an occasional hint of an \u0027s\u0027 at the end of a word.) She stood by the table while Bond folded his paper to the centre news page. \u0027Yon man was here again last night about the Televeesion.\u0027 \u0027What man was that?\u0027 Bond looked along the headlines. \u0027Yon man that\u0027s always coming. Six times he\u0027s been here pestering me since June. After what I said to him the first time about the sinful thing, you\u0027d think he\u0027d give up trying to sell us one. By hire purchase, too, if you please!\u0027 \u0027Persistent chaps these salesmen.\u0027 Bond put down his paper and reached for the coffee pot. \u0027I gave him a right piece of my mind last night. Disturbing folk at their supper. Asked him if he\u0027d got any papers–anything to show who he was.\u0027 \u0027I expect that fixed him.\u0027 Bond filled his large coffee cup to the brim with black coffee. \u0027Not a bit of it. Flourished his union card. Said he had every right to earn his living. Electricians Union it was too. They\u0027re the Communist one, aren\u0027t they-s?\u0027 \u0027Yes, that\u0027s right,\u0027 said Bond vaguely. His mind sharpened. Was it possible They could be keeping an eye on him? He took a sip of the coffee and put the cup down. \u0027Exactly what did this man say, May?\u0027 he asked, keeping his voice indifferent, but looking at her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-13.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
