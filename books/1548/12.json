She felt drained of resistance, tired, willing to do anything to finish with this interview and get away somewhere and sleep. She thought, so this is what it is like on the interrogation table, and that is the voice the Klebb uses. Well, it was working. She was docile now. She would co-operate.\n Rosa Klebb sat down. She observed the girl appraisingly from behind the motherly mask.\n \u0027And now, my dear, just one more intimate little question. As between girls. Do you enjoy making love? Does it give you pleasure? Much pleasure?\u0027\n Tatiana\u0027s hands came up again and covered her face. From behind them, in a muffled voice, she said, \u0027Well yes, Comrade Colonel. Naturally, when one is in love . . .\u0027 Her voice trailed away. What else could she say? What answer did this woman want?\n \u0027And supposing, my dear, you were not in love. Then would love-making with a man still give you pleasure?\u0027\n Tatiana shook her head indecisively. She took her hands down from her face and bowed her head. The hair fell down on either side in a heavy curtain. She was trying to think, to be helpful, but she couldn\u0027t imagine such a situation. She supposed ... \u0027I suppose it would depend on the man, Comrade Colonel.\u0027\n \u0027That is a sensible answer, my dear.\u0027 Rosa Klebb opened a drawer in the table. She took out a photograph and slipped it across to the girl. \u0027What about this man, for instance?\u0027\n Tatiana drew the photograph cautiously towards her as if it might catch fire. She looked down warily at the handsome, ruthless face. She tried to think, to imagine ... \u0027I cannot tell, Comrade Colonel. He is good-looking. Perhaps if he was gentle . . .\u0027 She pushed the photograph anxiously away from her.\n \u0027No, keep it, my dear. Put it up beside your bed and think of this man. You will learn more about him later in your new work. And now,\u0027 the eyes glittered behind the square panes of glass, \u0027would you like to know what your new work is to be? The task for which you have been chosen from all the girls in Russia?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, indeed, Comrade Colonel,\u0027 Tatiana looked obediently across at the intent face that was now pointing at her like a gun-dog.\n The wet, rubbery lips parted enticingly. \u0027It is a simple, delightful duty you have been chosen for, Comrade Corporal–a real labour of love, as we say. It is a matter of falling in love. That is all. Nothing else. Just falling in love with this man.\u0027\n \u0027But who is he? I don\u0027t even know him.\u0027\n Rosa Klebb\u0027s mouth revelled. This would give the silly chit of a girl something to think about.\n \u0027He is an English spy.\u0027\n \u0027Bozhi moi!\u0027 Tatiana clapped a hand over her mouth as much to stifle the use of God\u0027s name as from terror. She sat, tense with the shock, and gazed at Rosa Klebb through wide, slightly drunk eyes.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Rosa Klebb, pleased with the effect of her words. \u0027He is an English spy. Perhaps the most famous of them all. And from now on you are in love with him. So you had better get used to the idea. And no silliness, Comrade. We must be serious. This is an important State matter for which you have been chosen as the instrument. So no nonsense, please. Now for some practical details.\u0027 Rosa Klebb stopped. She said sharply, \u0027And take your hand away from your silly face. And stop looking like a frightened cow. Sit up in your chair and pay attention. Or it will be the worse for you. Understood?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 Tatiana quickly straightened her back and sat up with her hands in her lap as if she was back at the Security Officers\u0027 School. Her mind was in a ferment, but this was no time for personal things. Her whole training told her that this was an operation for the State. She was now working for her country. Somehow she had come to be chosen for an important konspiratsia. As an officer in the M.G.B., she must do her duty and do it well. She listened carefully and with her whole professional attention.\n \u0027For the moment,\u0027 Rosa Klebb put on her official voice, \u0027I will be brief. You will hear more later. For the next few weeks you will be most carefully trained for this operation until you know exactly what to do in all contingencies. You will be taught certain foreign customs. You will be equipped with beautiful clothes. You will be instructed in all the arts of allurement. Then you will be sent to a foreign country, somewhere in Europe. There you will meet this man. You will seduce him. In this matter you will have no silly compunctions. Your body belongs to the State. Since your birth, the State has nourished it. Now your body must work for the State. Is that understood?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027 The logic was inescapable. \u0027You will accompany this man to England. There, you will no doubt be questioned. The questioning will be easy. The English do not use harsh methods. You will give such answers as you can without endangering the State. We will supply you with certain answers which we would like to be given. You will probably be sent to Canada. That is where the English send a certain category of foreign prisoner. You will be rescued and brought back to Moscow.\u0027 Rosa Klebb peered at the girl. She seemed to be accepting all this without question. \u0027You see, it is a comparatively simple matter. Have you any questions at this stage?\u0027\n \u0027What will happen to the man, Comrade Colonel?\u0027 \u0027That is a matter of indifference to us. We shall simply use him as a means to introduce you into England. The object of the operation is to give false information to the British. We shall, of course, Comrade, be very glad to have your own impressions of life in England. The reports of a highly trained and intelligent girl such as yourself will be of great value to the State.\u0027\n \u0027Really, Comrade Colonel!\u0027 Tatiana felt important. Suddenly it all sounded exciting. If only she could do it well. She would assuredly do her very best. But supposing she could not make the English spy love her. She looked again at the photograph. She put her head on one side. It was an attractive face. What were these \u0027arts of allurement\u0027 that the woman had talked about? What could they be? Perhaps they would help.\n Satisfied, Rosa Klebb got up from the table. \u0027And now we can relax, my dear. Work is over for the night. I will go and tidy up and we will have a friendly chat together. I shan\u0027t be a moment. Eat up those chocolates or they will go to waste.\u0027 Rosa Klebb made a vague gesture of the hand and disappeared with a preoccupied look into the next room.\n Tatiana sat back in her chair. So that was what it was all about! It really wasn\u0027t so bad after all. What a relief! And what an honour to have been chosen. How silly to have been so frightened! Naturally the great leaders of the State would not allow harm to come to an innocent citizen who worked hard and had no black marks on her zapiska. Suddenly she felt immensely grateful to the father-figure that was the State, and proud that she would now have a chance to repay some of her debt. Even the Klebb woman wasn\u0027t really so bad after all.\n Tatiana was still cheerfully reviewing the situation when the bedroom door opened and \u0027the Klebb woman\u0027 appeared in the opening. \u0027What do you think of this my dear?\u0027 Colonel Klebb opened her dumpy arms and twirled on her toes like a mannequin. She struck a pose with one arm outstretched and the other arm crooked at her waist.\n Tatiana\u0027s mouth had fallen open. She shut it quickly. She searched for something to say.\n Colonel Klebb of SMERSH was wearing a semi-transparent nightgown in orange crêpe de chine. It had scallops of the same material round the low square neckline and scallops at the wrists of the broadly flounced sleeves. Underneath could be seen a brassière consisting of two large pink satin roses. Below, she wore old-fashioned knickers of pink satin with elastic above the knees. One dimpled knee, like a yellowish coconut, appeared thrust forward between the half open folds of the nightgown in the classic stance of the modeller. The feet were enclosed in pink satin slippers with pompoms of ostrich feathers. Rosa Klebb had taken off her spectacles and her naked face was now thick with mascara and rouge and lipstick.\n She looked like the oldest and ugliest whore in the world.\n Tatiana stammered, \u0027It is very pretty.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it,\u0027 twittered the woman. She went over to a broad couch in the corner of the room. It was covered with a garish piece of peasant tapestry. At the back, against the wall, were rather grimy satin cushions in pastel colours.\n With a squeak of pleasure, Rosa Klebb threw herself down in the caricature of a Recamier pose. She reached up an arm and turned on a pink shaded table-lamp whose stem was a naked woman in sham Lalique glass. She patted the couch beside her.\n \u0027Turn out the top light, my dear. The switch is by the door. Then come and sit beside me. We must get to know each other better.\u0027\n Tatiana walked to the door. She switched off the top light. Her hand dropped decisively to the door knob. She turned it and opened the door and stepped coolly out into the corridor. Suddenly her nerve broke. She banged the door shut behind her and ran wildly off down the corridor with her hands over her ears against the pursuing scream that never came.\n Chapter Ten\n The Fuse Burns\n It was the morning of the next day.\n Colonel Klebb sat at her desk in the roomy office that was her headquarters in the underground basement of SMERSH. It was more an operations room than an office. One wall was completely papered with a map of the Western Hemisphere. The opposite wall was covered with the Eastern Hemisphere. Behind her desk and within reach of her left hand, a Telekrypton occasionally chattered out a signal en clair, duplicating another machine in the Cipher Department under the tall radio masts on the roof of the building. From time to time, when Colonel Klebb thought of it, she tore off the lengthening strip of tape and read through the signals. This was a formality. If anything important happened, her telephone would ring. Every agent of SMERSH throughout the world was controlled from this room, and it was a vigilant and iron control.\n The heavy face looked sullen and dissipated. The chicken-skin under the eyes was pouched and the whites of the eyes were veined with red.\n One of the three telephones at her side purred softly. She picked up the receiver. \u0027Send him in.\u0027\n She turned to Kronsteen who sat, picking his teeth thoughtfully with an opened paper clip, in an armchair up against the left-hand wall, under the toe of Africa. \u0027Granitsky.\u0027\n Kronsteen slowly turned his head and looked at the door. Red Grant came in and closed the door softly behind him. He walked up to the desk and stood looking down, obediently, almost hungrily, into the eyes of his Commanding Officer. Kronsteen thought that he looked like a powerful mastiff, waiting to be fed.\n Rosa Klebb surveyed him coldly. \u0027Are you fit and ready for work?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Comrade Colonel.\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s have a look at you. Take off your clothes.\u0027\n Red Grant showed no surprise. He took off his coat and, after looking around for somewhere to put it, dropped it on the floor. Then, unselfconsciously, he took off the rest of his clothes and kicked off his shoes. The great red-brown body with its golden hair lit up the drab room. Grant stood relaxed, his hands held loosely at his sides and one knee bent slightly forward, as if he was posing for an art class.\n Rosa Klebb got to her feet and came round the desk. She studied the body minutely, prodding here, feeling there, as if she was buying a horse. She went behind the man and continued her minute inspection. Before she came back in front of him, Kronsteen saw her slip something out of her jacket pocket and fit it into her hand. There was a glint of metal.\n The woman came round and stood close up to the man\u0027s gleaming stomach, her right arm behind her back. She held his eyes in hers. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-12.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
