{"id":107369,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"It was big and square and panelled in polished mahogany, except behind Kerim\u0027s chair where a length of Oriental tapestry hung down from the ceiling and gently moved in the breeze as if there was an open window behind it. But this seemed unlikely as light came from three circular windows high up in the walls. Perhaps, behind the tapestry, was a balcony looking out over the Golden Horn, whose waves Bond could hear lapping at the walls below. In the centre of the right-hand wall hung a gold-framed reproduction of Annigoni\u0027s portrait of the Queen. Opposite, also imposingly framed, was Cecil Beaton\u0027s war-time photograph of Winston Churchill looking up from his desk in the Cabinet Offices like a contemptuous bulldog. A broad bookcase stood against one wall and, opposite, a comfortably padded leather settee. In the centre of the room the big desk winked with polished brass handles. On the littered desk were three silver photograph frames, and Bond caught a sideways view of the copperplate script of two Mentions in Dispatches and the Military Division of the O.B.E. Kerim lit his cigarette. He jerked his head back at the piece of tapestry. \u0027Our friends paid me a visit yesterday,\u0027 he said casually. \u0027Fixed a limpet bomb on the wall outside. Timed the fuse to catch me at my desk. By good luck, I had taken a few minutes off to relax on the couch over there with a young Rumanian girl who still believes that a man will tell secrets in exchange for love. The bomb went off at a vital moment. I refused to be disturbed, but I fear the experience was too much for the girl. When I released her, she had hysterics. I\u0027m afraid she had decided that my love-making is altogether too violent.\u0027 He waved his cigarette holder apologetically. \u0027But it was a rush to get the room put to rights in time for your visit. New glass for the windows and my pictures, and the place stinks of paint. However.\u0027 Kerim sat back in his chair. There was a slight frown on his face. \u0027What I cannot understand is this sudden breach of the peace. We live together very amicably in Istanbul. We all have our work to do. It is unheard of that my chers collègues should suddenly declare war in this way. It is quite worrying. It can only lead to trouble for our Russian friends. I shall be forced to rebuke the man who did it when I have found out his name.\u0027 Kerim shook his head. \u0027It is most confusing. I am hoping it has nothing to do with this case of ours.\u0027 \u0027But was it necessary to make my arrival so public?\u0027 Bond asked mildly. \u0027The last thing I want is to get you involved in all this. Why send the Rolls to the airport? It only ties you in with me.\u0027 Kerim\u0027s laugh was indulgent. \u0027My friend, I must explain something which you should know. We and the Russians and the Americans have a paid man in all the hotels. And we have all bribed an official of the Secret police at Headquarters and we receive a carbon copy of the list of all foreigners entering the country every day by air or train or sea. Given a few more days I could have smuggled you in through the Greek frontier. But for what purpose? Your existence here has to be known to the other side so that our friend can contact you. It is a condition she had laid down that she will make her own arrangements for the meeting. Perhaps she does not trust our security. Who knows? But she was definite about it and she said, as if I didn\u0027t know it, that her centre would immediately be advised of your arrival.\u0027 Kerim shrugged his broad shoulders. \u0027So why make things difficult for her? I am merely concerned with making things easy and comfortable for you so that you will at least enjoy your stay–even if it is fruitless.\u0027 Bond laughed. \u0027I take it all back. I\u0027d forgotten the Balkan formula. Anyway I\u0027m under your orders here. You tell me what to do and I\u0027ll do it.\u0027 Kerim waved the subject aside. \u0027And now, since we are talking of your comfort, how is your hotel? I was surprised you chose the Palas. It is little better than a disorderly house–what the French call a baisodrome. And it\u0027s quite a haunt of the Russians. Not that that matters.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not too bad. I just didn\u0027t want to stay at the Istanbul-Hilton or one of the other smart places.\u0027 \u0027Money?\u0027 Kerim reached into a drawer and took out a flat packet of new green notes. \u0027Here\u0027s a thousand Turkish pounds. Their real value, and their rate on the black market, is about twenty to the pound. The official rate is seven. Tell me when you\u0027ve finished them and I\u0027ll give you as many more as you want. We can do our accounts after the game. It\u0027s muck, anyway. Ever since Croesus, the first millionaire, invented gold coins, money has depreciated. And the face of the coin has been debased as fast as its value. First the faces of gods were on the coins. Then the faces of kings. Then of presidents. Now there\u0027s no face at all. Look at this stuff!\u0027 Kerim tossed the money over to Bond. \u0027Today it\u0027s only paper, with a picture of a public building and the signature of a cashier. Muck! The miracle is that you can still buy things with it. However. What else? Cigarettes? Smoke only these. I will have a few hundred sent up to your hotel. They\u0027re the best. Diplomates. They\u0027re not easy to get. Most of them go to the Ministries and the Embassies. Anything else before we get down to business? Don\u0027t worry about your meals and your leisure. I will look after both. I shall enjoy it and, if you will forgive me, I wish to stay close to you while you are here.\u0027 \u0027Nothing else,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Except that you must come over to London one day.\u0027 \u0027Never,\u0027 said Kerim definitely. \u0027The weather and the women are far too cold. And I am proud to have you here. It reminds me of the war. Now,\u0027 he rang a bell on his desk. \u0027Do you like your coffee plain or sweet? In Turkey we cannot talk seriously without coffee or raki and it is too early for raki.\u0027 \u0027Plain.\u0027 The door behind Bond opened. Kerim barked an order. When the door was shut, Kerim unlocked a drawer and took out a file and put it in front of him. He smacked his hand down on it. \u0027My friend,\u0027 he said grimly, \u0027I do not know what to say about this case.\u0027 He leant back in his chair and linked his hands behind his neck. \u0027Has it ever occurred to you that our kind of work is rather like shooting a film? So often I have got everybody on location and I think I can start turning the handle. Then it\u0027s the weather, and then it\u0027s the actors, and then it\u0027s the accidents. And there is something else that also happens in the making of a film. Love appears in some shape or form, at the very worst, as it is now, between the two stars. To me that is the most confusing factor in this case, and the most inscrutable one. Does this girl really love her idea of you? Will she love you when she sees you? Will you be able to love her enough to make her come over?\u0027 Bond made no comment. There was a knock on the door and the head clerk put a china eggshell, enclosed in gold filigree, in front of each of them and went out. Bond sipped his coffee and put it down. It was good, but thick with grains. Kerim swallowed his at a gulp and fitted a cigarette into his holder and lit it. \u0027But there is nothing we can do about this love matter,\u0027 Kerim continued, speaking half to himself. \u0027We can only wait and see. In the meantime there are other things.\u0027 He leant forward against the desk and looked across at Bond, his eyes suddenly very hard and shrewd. \u0027There is something going on in the enemy camp, my friend. It is not only this attempt to get rid of me. There are comings and goings. I have few facts,\u0027 he reached up a big index finger and laid it alongside his nose, \u0027but I have this.\u0027 He tapped the side of his nose as if he was patting a dog. \u0027But this is a good friend of mine and I trust him.\u0027 He brought his hand slowly and significantly down on to the desk and added softly, \u0027And if the stakes were not so big, I would say to you, \u0027\u0027Go home my friend. Go home. There is something here to get away from\u0027\u0027.\u0027 Kerim sat back. The tension went out of his voice. He barked out a harsh laugh. \u0027But we are not old women. And this is our work. So let us forget my nose and get on with the job. First of all, is there anything I can tell you that you do not know? The girl has made no sign of life since my signal and I have no other information. But perhaps you would like to ask me some questions about the meeting.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s only one thing I want to know,\u0027 said Bond flatly. \u0027What do you think of this girl? Do you believe her story or not? Her story about me? Nothing else matters. If she hasn\u0027t got some sort of a hysterical crush on me, the whole business falls to the ground and it\u0027s some complicated M.G.B. plot we can\u0027t understand. Now. Did you believe the girl?\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was urgent and his eyes searched the other man\u0027s face. \u0027Ah, my friend,\u0027 Kerim shook his head. He spread his arms wide. \u0027That is what I asked myself then, and it is what I ask myself the whole time since. But who can tell if a woman is lying about these things? Her eyes were bright–those beautiful innocent eyes. Her lips were moist and parted in that heavenly mouth. Her voice was urgent and frightened at what she was doing and saying. Her knuckles were white on the guard rail of the ship. But what was in her heart?\u0027 Kerim raised his hands, \u0027God alone knows.\u0027 He brought his hands down resignedly. He placed them flat on the desk and looked straight at Bond. \u0027There is only one way of telling if a woman really loves you, and even that way can only be read by an expert.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond dubiously. \u0027I know what you mean. In bed.\u0027 Chapter Fifteen Background to a Spy Coffee came again, and then more coffee, and the big room grew thick with cigarette smoke as the two men took each shred of evidence, dissected it and put it aside. At the end of an hour they were back where they had started. It was up to Bond to solve the problem of this girl and, if he was satisfied with her story, get her and the machine out of the country. Kerim undertook to look after the administrative problems. As a first step he picked up the telephone and spoke to his travel agent and reserved two seats on every outgoing plane for the next week–by B.E.A., Air France, S.A.S. and Turkair. \u0027And now you must have a passport,\u0027 he said. \u0027One will be sufficient. She can travel as your wife. One of my men will take your photograph and he will find a photograph of some girl who looks more or less like her. As a matter of fact, an early picture of Garbo would serve. There is a certain resemblance. He can get one from the newspaper files. I will speak to the Consul General. He\u0027s an excellent fellow who likes my little cloak-and-dagger plots. The passport will be ready by this evening. What name would you like to have?\u0027 \u0027Take one out of a hat.\u0027 \u0027Somerset. My mother came from there. David Somerset. Profession, Company Director. That means nothing. And the girl? Let us say Caroline. She looks like a Caroline. A couple of clean-limbed young English people with a taste for travel. Finance Control Form? Leave that to me. It will show eighty pounds in travellers\u0027 cheques, let\u0027s say, and a receipt from the bank to show you changed fifty while you were in Turkey. Customs? They never look at anything. Only too glad if somebody has bought something in the country. You will declare some Turkish Delight–presents for your friends in London. If you have to get out quickly, leave your hotel bill and luggage to me. They know me well enough at the Palas. Anything else?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t think of anything.\u0027 Kerim looked at his watch. \u0027Twelve o\u0027clock. Just time for the car to take you back to your hotel. There might be a message. And have a good look at your things to see if anyone has been inquisitive. He rang the bell and fired instructions at the head clerk who stood with his sharp eyes on Kerim\u0027s and his lean head straining forward like a whippet\u0027s. Kerim led Bond to the door. There came again the warm powerful handclasp. \u0027The car will bring you to lunch,\u0027 he said. \u0027A little place in the Spice Bazaar.\u0027 His eyes looked happily into Bond\u0027s. \u0027And I am glad to be working with you. We will do well together.\u0027 He let go of Bond\u0027s hand. \u0027And now I have a lot of things to do very quickly. They may be the wrong things, but at any rate,\u0027 he grinned broadly, \u0027jouons mal, mais jouons vite!\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-18.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
