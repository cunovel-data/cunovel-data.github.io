{"id":107386,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"It was a typical Ritz sitting-room, extremely elegant, with good Empire furniture. The walls were white and the curtains and chair covers were of a small patterned chintz of red roses on white. The carpet was wine-red and close-fitted.\n In a pool of sunshine, in a low armed chair beside a Directoire writing desk, a little old woman sat knitting.\n The tinkle of the steel needles continued. The eyes behind light-blue tinted bi-focals examined Bond with polite curiosity.\n \u0027Oui, Monsieur?\u0027 The voice was deep and hoarse. The thickly powdered, rather puffy face under the white hair showed nothing but well-bred interest.\n Bond\u0027s hand on the gun under his coat was taut as a steel spring. His half-closed eyes flickered round the room and back to the little old woman in the chair.\n Had he made a mistake? Was this the wrong room? Should he apologize and get out? Could this woman possibly belong to SMERSH? She looked so exactly like the sort of respectable rich widow one would expect to find sitting by herself in the Ritz, whiling the time away with her knitting. The sort of woman who would have her own table, and her favourite waiter, in a corner of the restaurant downstairs–not, of course, the grill room. The sort of woman who would doze after lunch and then be fetched by an elegant black limousine with white side-walled tyres and be driven to the tea-room in the rue de Berri to meet some other rich crone. The old-fashioned black dress with the touch of lace at the throat and wrists, the thin gold chain that hung down over the shapeless bosom and ended in a folding lorgnette, the neat little feet in the sensible black-buttoned boots that barely touched the floor. It couldn\u0027t be Klebb! Bond had got the number of the room wrong. He could feel the perspiration under his arms. But now he would have to play the scene through.\n \u0027My name is Bond, James Bond.\u0027\n \u0027And I, Monsieur, am the Comtesse Metterstein. What can I do for you?\u0027 The French was rather thick. She might be German Swiss. The needles tinkled busily.\n \u0027I am afraid Captain Nash has met with an accident. He won\u0027t be coming today. So I came instead.\u0027\n Did the eyes narrow a fraction behind the pale blue spectacles?\n \u0027I have not the pleasure of the Captain\u0027s acquaintance, Monsieur. Nor of yours. Please sit down and state your business.\u0027 The woman inclined her head an inch towards the high-backed chair beside the writing desk.\n One couldn\u0027t fault her. The graciousness of it all was devastating. Bond walked across the room and sat down. Now he was about six feet away from her. The desk held nothing but a tall old-fashioned telephone with a receiver on a hook, and, within reach of her hand, an ivory-buttoned bellpush. The black mouth of the telephone yawned at Bond politely.\n Bond stared rudely into the woman\u0027s face, examining it. It was an ugly face, toadlike, under the powder and under the tight cottage-loaf of white hair. The eyes were so light brown as to be almost yellow. The pale lips were wet and blubbery below the fringe of nicotine-stained moustache. Nicotine? Where were her cigarettes? There was no ashtray–no smell of smoke in the room.\n Bond\u0027s hand tightened again on his gun. He glanced down at the bag of knitting, at the shapeless length of small-denier beige wool the woman was working on. The steel needles. What was there odd about them? The ends were discoloured as if they had been held in fire. Did knitting needles ever look like that?\n \u0027Eh bien, Monsieur\u0027 Was there an edge to the voice? Had she read something in his face?\n Bond smiled. His muscles were tense, waiting for any movement, any trick. \u0027It\u0027s no use,\u0027 he said cheerfully, gambling. You are Rosa Klebb. And you are Head of Otdyel II of SMERSH. You are a torturer and a murderer. You wanted to kill me and the Romanov girl. I am very glad to meet you at last.\u0027\n The eyes had not changed. The harsh voice was patient and polite. The woman reached out her left hand towards the bell-push. \u0027Monsieur, I am afraid you are deranged. I must ring for the valet de chambre and have you shown to the door.\u0027\n Bond never knew what saved his life. Perhaps it was the flash of realization that no wires led from the bellpush to the wall or into the carpet. Perhaps it was the sudden memory of the English \u0027Come in\u0027 when the expected knock came on the door. But, as her finger reached the ivory knob, he hurled himself sideways out of the chair.\n As Bond hit the ground there was a sharp noise of tearing calico. Splinters from the back of his chair sprayed around him. The chair crashed to the floor.\n Bond twisted over, tugging at his gun. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed a curl of blue smoke coming from the mouth of the \u0027telephone\u0027. Then the woman was on him, the knitting needles glinting in her clenched fists.\n She stabbed downwards at his legs. Bond lashed out with his feet and hurled her sideways. She had aimed at his legs! As he got to one knee, Bond knew what the coloured tips of the needles meant. It was poison. Probably one of those German nerve poisons. All she had to do was scratch him, even through his clothes.\n Bond was on his feet. She was coming at him again. He tugged furiously at his gun. The silencer had caught. There was a flash of light. Bond dodged. One of the needles rattled against the wall behind him and the dreadful chunk of woman, the white bun of wig askew on her head, the slimy lips drawn back from her teeth, was on top of him.\n Bond, not daring to use his naked fists against the needles, vaulted sideways over the desk.\n Panting and talking to herself in Russian, Rosa Klebb scuttled round the desk, the remaining needle held forward like a rapier. Bond backed away, working at the stuck gun. The back of his legs came against a small chair. He let go the gun and reached behind him and snatched it up. Holding it by the back, with its legs pointing like horns, he went round the desk to meet her. But she was beside the bogus telephone. She swept it up and aimed it. Her hand went to the button. Bond leapt forward. He crashed the chair down. Bullets sprayed into the ceiling and plaster pattered down on his head.\n Bond lunged again. The legs of the chair clutched the woman round the waist and over her shoulders. God she was strong! She gave way, but only to the wall. There she held her ground, spitting at Bond over the top of the chair, while the knitting needle quested towards him like a long scorpion\u0027s sting.\n Bond stood back a little, holding the chair at arms\u0027 length. He took aim and high-kicked at the probing wrist. The needle sailed away into the room and pinged down behind him.\n Bond came in closer. He examined the position. Yes, the woman was held firmly against the wall by the four legs of the chair. There was no way she could get out of the cage except by brute force. Her arms and legs and head were free, but the body was pinned to the wall.\n The woman hissed something in Russian. She spat at him over the chair. Bond bent his head and wiped his face against his sleeve. He looked up and into the mottled face.\n \u0027That\u0027s all, Rosa,\u0027 he said. \u0027The Deuxième will be here in a minute. In an hour or so you\u0027ll be in London. You won\u0027t be seen leaving the hotel. You won\u0027t be seen going into England. In fact very few people will see you again. From now on you\u0027re just a number on a secret file. By the time we\u0027ve finished with you you\u0027ll be ready for the lunatic asylum.\u0027\n The face, a few feet away, was changing. Now the blood had drained out of it, and it was yellow. But not, thought Bond, with fear. The pale eyes looked levelly into his. They were not defeated.\n The wet, shapeless mouth lengthened in a grin.\n \u0027And where will you be when I am in the asylum, Mister Bond?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, getting on with my life.\u0027\n \u0027I think not, Angliski spion.\u0027\n Bond hardly noticed the words. He had heard the click of the door opening. A burst of laughter came from the room behind him.\n \u0027Eh bien\u0027 it was the voice of delight that Bond remembered so well. \u0027The 70th position! Now, at last, I have seen everything. And invented by an Englishman! James, this really is an insult to my countrymen.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t recommend it,\u0027 said Bond over his shoulder. \u0027It\u0027s too strenuous. Anyway, you can take over now. I\u0027ll introduce you. Her name\u0027s Rosa. You\u0027ll like her. She\u0027s a big noise in SMERSH–she looks after the murdering, as a matter of fact.\u0027\n Mathis came up. There were two laundry-men with him. The three of them stood and looked respectfully into the dreadful face.\n \u0027Rosa,\u0027 said Mathis thoughtfully. \u0027But, this time, a Rosa Malheur. Well, well! But I am sure she is uncomfortable in that position. You two, bring along the panier de fleurs–she will be more comfortable lying down.\n The two men walked to the door. Bond heard the creak of the laundry basket.\n The woman\u0027s eyes were still locked in Bond\u0027s. She moved a little, shifting her weight. Out of Bond\u0027s sight, and not noticed by Mathis, who was still examining her face, the toe of one shiny buttoned boot pressed under the instep of the other. From the point of its toe there slid forward half an inch of thin knife blade. Like the knitting needles, the steel had a dirty bluish tinge.\n The two men came up and put the big square basket down beside Mathis.\n \u0027Take her,\u0027 said Mathis. He bowed slightly to the woman. \u0027It has been an honour.\u0027\n \u0027Au revoir, Rosa,\u0027 said Bond.\n The yellow eyes blazed briefly.\n \u0027Farewell, Mister Bond.\u0027\n The boot, with its tiny steel tongue, flashed out.\n Bond felt a sharp pain in his right calf. It was only the sort of pain you would get from a kick. He flinched and stepped back. The two men seized Rosa Klebb by the arms.\n Mathis laughed. \u0027My poor James,\u0027 he said. \u0027Count on SMERSH to have the last word.\u0027\n The tongue of dirty steel had withdrawn into the leather. Now it was only a harmless bundle of old woman that was being lifted into the basket.\n Mathis watched the lid being secured. He turned to Bond. \u0027It is a good day\u0027s work you have done, my friend,\u0027 he said. \u0027But you look tired. Go back to the Embassy and have a rest because this evening we must have dinner together. The best dinner in Paris. And I will find the loveliest girl to go with it.\u0027\n Numbness was creeping up Bond\u0027s body. He felt very cold. He lifted his hand to brush back the comma of hair over his right eyebrow. There was no feeling in his fingers. They seemed as big as cucumbers. His hand fell heavily to his side.\n Breathing became difficult. Bond sighed to the depth of his lungs. He clenched his jaws and half closed his eyes, as people do when they want to hide their drunkenness.\n Through his eyelashes he watched the basket being carried to the door. He prised his eyes open. Desperately he focused Mathis.\n \u0027I shan\u0027t need a girl, René,\u0027 he said thickly.\n Now he had to gasp for breath. Again his hand moved up towards his cold face. He had an impression of Mathis starting towards him.\n Bond felt his knees begin to buckle.\n He said, or thought he said, \u0027I\u0027ve already got the loveliest. . . .\u0027 Bond pivoted slowly on his heel and crashed headlong to the wine-red floor.\n THE END \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-36.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: \n From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
