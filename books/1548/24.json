{"id":107374,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Kerim stretched out his huge hand. Vavra took it and held it and looked into Kerim\u0027s eyes. For a moment his own fierce eyes seemed to go opaque. Then the gipsy let the hand drop and turned to Bond. The hand was dry and rough and padded like the paw of a big animal. Again the eyes went opaque. He let go of Bond\u0027s hand. He spoke rapidly and urgently to Kerim and turned his back on them and walked away towards the trees.\\n\\n Nobody looked up from his work as Kerim and Bond climbed through the breach in the wall. The Rolls stood, glittering in the moonlight, a few yards down the road opposite the cafe entrance. A young man was sitting beside the chauffeur. Kerim gestured with his hand. \u0027That is my tenth son. He is called Boris. I thought I might need him. I shall.\u0027\\n\\n The youth turned and said, \u0027Good evening, sir.\u0027 Bond recognized him as one of the clerks in the warehouse. He was as dark and lean as the head clerk, and his eyes also were blue.\\n\\n The car moved down the hill. Kerim spoke to the chauffeur in English. \u0027It is a small street off the Hippodrome Square. When we get there we will proceed softly. I will tell you when to stop. Have you got the uniforms and the equipment?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Kerim Bey.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right. Make good speed. It is time we were all in bed.\u0027\\n\\n Kerim sank back in his seat. He took out a cigarette. They sat and smoked. Bond gazed out at the drab streets and reflected that sparse street-lighting is the sure sign of a poor town.\\n\\n It was some time before Kerim spoke. Then he said, \u0027The gipsy said we both have the wings of death over us. He said that I am to beware of a son of the snows and you must beware of a man who is owned by the moon.\u0027 He laughed harshly. \u0027That is the sort of rigmarole they talk. But he says that Krilencu isn\u0027t either of these men. That is good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I cannot sleep until I have killed that man. I do not know if what happened tonight has any connection with you and your assignment. I do not care. For some reason, war has been declared on me. If I do not kill Krilencu, at the third attempt he will certainly kill me. So we are now on our way to keep an appointment with him in Samarra.\u0027\\n\\n Chapter Nineteen\\n\\n The Mouth of Marilyn Monroe\\n\\n The car sped through the deserted streets, past shadowy mosques from which dazzling minarets lanced up towards the three-quarter moon, under the ruined Aqueduct and across the Ataturk Boulevard and north of the barred entrances to the Grand Bazaar. At the Column of Constantine the car turned right, through mean twisting streets that smelled of garbage, and finally debouched into a long ornamental square in which three stone columns fired themselves like a battery of space-rockets into the spangled sky.\\n\\n \u0027Slow,\u0027 said Kerim softly. They crept round the square under the shadow of the lime trees. Down a street on the east side, the lighthouse below the Seraglio Palace gave them a great yellow wink.\\n\\n \u0027Stop.\u0027\\n\\n The car pulled up in the darkness under the limes. Kerim reached for the door handle. \u0027We shan\u0027t be long, James. You sit up front in the driver\u0027s seat and if a policeman comes along just say \u0027\u0027Ben Bey Kerim\u0027in ortagiyim\u0027\u0027. Can you remember that? It means \u0027\u0027I am Kerim Bey\u0027s partner\u0027\u0027. They\u0027ll leave you alone.\u0027\\n\\n Bond snorted. \u0027Thanks very much. But you\u0027ll be surprised to hear I\u0027m coming with you. You\u0027re bound to get into trouble without me. Anyway I\u0027m damned if I\u0027m going to sit here trying to bluff policemen. The worst of learning one good phrase is that it sounds as if one knew the language. The policeman will come back with a barrage of Turkish and when I can\u0027t answer he\u0027ll smell a rat. Don\u0027t argue, Darko.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, don\u0027t blame me if you don\u0027t like this.\u0027 Kerim\u0027s voice was embarrassed. \u0027It\u0027s going to be a straight killing in cold blood. In my country you let sleeping dogs lie, but when they wake up and bite, you shoot them. You don\u0027t offer them a duel. All right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whatever you say,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve got one bullet left in case you miss.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on then,\u0027 said Kerim reluctantly. \u0027We\u0027ve got quite a walk. The other two will be going another way.\u0027\\n\\n Kerim took a long walking-stick from the chauffeur, and a leather case. He slung them over his shoulder and they started off down the street into the yellow wink of the lighthouse. Their footsteps echoed hollowly back at them from the iron-shuttered shop frontages. There was not a soul in sight, not a cat, and Bond was glad he was not walking alone down this long street towards the distant baleful eye.\\n\\n From the first, Istanbul had given him the impression of a town where, with the night, horror creeps out of the stones. It seemed to him a town the centuries had so drenched in blood and violence that, when daylight went out, the ghosts of its dead were its only population. His instinct told him, as it has told other travellers, that Istanbul was a town he would be glad to get out of alive.\\n\\n They came to a narrow stinking alley that dived steeply down the hill to their right. Kerim turned into it and started gingerly down its cobbled surface. \u0027Watch your feet,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Garbage is a polite word for what my charming people throw into their streets.\u0027\\n\\n The moon shone whitely down the moist river of cobbles. Bond kept his mouth shut and breathed through his nose. He put his feet down one after the other, flat-footedly, and with his knees bent, as if he was walking down a snow-slope. He thought of his bed in the hotel and of the comfortable cushions of the car under the sweetly smelling lime trees, and he wondered how many more kinds of dreadful stench he was going to run into during his present assignment.\\n\\n They stopped at the bottom of the alley. Kerim turned to him with a broad white grin. He pointed upwards at a towering block of black shadow. \u0027Mosque of Sultan Ahmet. Famous Byzantine frescoes. Sorry I haven\u0027t got time to show you more of the beauties of my country.\u0027 Without waiting for Bond\u0027s reply, he cut off to the right and along a dusty boulevard, lined with cheap shops, that sloped down towards the distant glint that was the Sea of Marmara. For ten minutes they walked in silence. Then Kerim slowed and beckoned Bond into the shadows.\\n\\n \u0027This will be a simple operation,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Krilencu lives down there, beside the railway line.\u0027 He gestured vaguely towards a cluster of red and green lights at the end of the boulevard. \u0027He hides out in a shack behind a bill-hoarding. There is a front door to the shack. Also a trapdoor to the street through the hoarding. He thinks no one knows of this. My two men will go in at the front door. He will slip out through the hoarding. Then I shoot him. All right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you say so.\u0027\\n\\n They walked on down the boulevard, keeping close to the wall. After ten minutes, they came in sight of the twenty-foot-high hoarding that formed a facing wall to the T intersection at the bottom of the street. The moon was behind the hoarding and its face was in shadow. Now Kerim walked even more carefully, putting each foot softly in front of him. About a hundred yards from the hoarding the shadows ended and the moon blazed whitely down on the intersection. Kerim stopped in the last dark doorway and stationed Bond in front of him, up against his chest. \u0027Now we must wait,\u0027 he whispered. Bond heard Kerim fiddling behind him. There came a soft plop as the lid of the leather case came off. A thin, heavy steel tube, about two feet long, with a bulge at each end, was pressed into Bond\u0027s hand. \u0027Sniperscope. German model,\u0027 whispered Kerim. \u0027Infrared lens. Sees in the dark. Have a look at that big film advertisement over there. That face. Just below the nose. You\u0027ll see the outline of a trap-door. In direct line down from the signal box.\u0027\\n\\n Bond rested his forearm against the door jamb and raised the tube to his right eye. He focused it on the patch of black shadow opposite. Slowly the black dissolved into grey. The outline of a huge woman\u0027s face and some lettering appeared. Now Bond could read the lettering. It said: \u0027NIYAGARA. MARILYN MONROE YE JOSEPH GOTTEN\u0027 and underneath, the cartoon feature, \u0027BONZO FUTBOLOU\u0027. Bond inched the glass down the vast pile of Marilyn Monroe\u0027s hair, and the cliff of forehead, and down the two feet of nose to the cavernous nostrils. A faint square showed in the poster. It ran from below the nose into the great alluring curve of the lips. It was about three feet deep. From it, there would be a longish drop to the ground.\\n\\n Behind Bond there sounded a series of soft clicks. Kerim held forward his walking-stick. As Bond had supposed, it was a gun, a rifle, with a skeleton butt which was also a twist breech. The squat bulge of a silencer had taken the place of the rubber tip.\\n\\n \u0027Barrel from the new 88 Winchester,\u0027 whispered Kerim proudly. \u0027Put together for me by a, man in Ankara. Takes the .308 cartridge. The short one. Three of them. Give me the glass. I want to get that trap-door lined up before my men go in at the front. Mind if I use your shoulder as a rest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027 Bond handed Kerim the Sniperscope. Kerim clipped it to the top of the barrel and slid the gun along Bond\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Got it,\u0027 whispered Kerim. \u0027Where Vavra said. He\u0027s a good man that.\u0027 He lowered his gun just as two policemen appeared at the right-hand corner of the intersection. Bond stiffened.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 whispered Kerim. \u0027That\u0027s my boy and the chauffeur.\u0027 He put two fingers in his mouth. A very quick, very low-pitched whistle sounded for a fraction of a second. One of the policemen lifted his hand to the back of his neck. The two policemen turned and walked away, their boots ringing loudly on the paving stones.\\n\\n \u0027Few minutes more,\u0027 whispered Kerim. \u0027They\u0027ve got to get round the back of that hoarding.\u0027 Bond felt the heavy barrel of the gun slip into place along his right shoulder.\\n\\n The moonstruck silence was broken by a loud iron clang from the signal box behind the hoarding. One of the signal arms dropped. A green pinpoint of light showed among the cluster of reds. There was a soft slow rumble in the distance, away to the left by Seraglio Point. It came close and sorted itself into the heavy pant of an engine and the grinding clangour of a string of badly coupled goods trucks. A faint yellow glimmer shone along the embankment to the left. The engine came labouring into view above the hoarding.\\n\\n The train slowly clanked by on its hundred-mile journey to the Greek frontier, a broken black silhouette against the silver sea, and the heavy cloud of smoke from its cheap fuel drifted towards them on the still air. As the red light on the brake van glimmered briefly and disappeared, there came the deeper rumble as the engine entered a cutting, and then two harsh, mournful whoops as it whistled its approach to the little station of Buyuk, a mile further down the line.\\n\\n The rumble of the train died away. Bond felt the gun press deeper into his shoulder. He strained his eyes into the target of shadow. In the centre of it, a deeper square of blackness showed.\\n\\n Bond cautiously lifted his left hand to shade his eyes from the moon. There came a hiss of breath from behind his right ear. \u0027He\u0027s coming.\u0027\\n\\n Out of the mouth of the huge, shadowed poster, between the great violet lips, half-open in ecstasy, the dark shape of a man emerged and hung down like a worm from the mouth of a corpse.\\n\\n The man dropped. A ship going up towards the Bosphorus growled in the night like a sleepless animal in a zoo. Bond felt a prickle of sweat on his forehead. The barrel of the rifle depressed as the man stepped softly off the pavement towards them.\\n\\n When he\u0027s at the edge of the shadow, he\u0027ll start to run, thought Bond. You damn fool, get the sights further down.\\n\\n Now. The man bent for a quick sprint across the dazzling white street. He was coming out of the shadow. His right leg was bent forward and his shoulder was twisted to give him momentum.\\n\\n At Bond\u0027s ear there was the clunk of an axe hitting into a tree-trunk. The man dived forward, his arms outstretched. There was a sharp \u0027tok\u0027 as his chin or his forehead hit the ground. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-24.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) \\n Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
