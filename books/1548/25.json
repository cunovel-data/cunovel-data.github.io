{"id":107375,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"An empty cartridge tinkled down at Bond\u0027s feet. He heard the click of the next round going into the chamber. The man\u0027s fingers scrabbled briefly at the cobbles. His shoes knocked on the road. Then he lay absolutely still. Kerim grunted. The rifle came down off Bond\u0027s shoulder. Bond listened to the noises of Kerim folding up the gun and putting away the Sniperscope in its leather case. Bond looked away from the sprawling figure in the road, the figure of the man who had been, but was no more. He had a moment of resentment against the life that made him witness these things. The resentment was not against Kerim. Kerim had twice been this man\u0027s target. In a way it had been a long duel, in which the man had fired twice to Kerim\u0027s once. But Kerim was the cleverer, cooler man, and the luckier, and that had been that. But Bond had never killed in cold blood, and he hadn\u0027t liked watching, and helping, someone else do it. Kerim silently took his arm. They walked slowly away from the scene and back the way they had come. Kerim seemed to sense Bond\u0027s thoughts. \u0027Life is full of death, my friend,\u0027 he said philosophically. \u0027And sometimes one is made the instrument of death. I do not regret killing that man. Nor would I regret killing any of those Russians we saw in that office today. They are hard people. With them, what you don\u0027t get from strength, you won\u0027t get from mercy. They are all the same, the Russians. I wish your government would realize it and be strong with them. Just an occasional little lesson in manners like I have taught them tonight.\u0027 \u0027In power politics, one doesn\u0027t often have the chance of being as quick and neat as you were tonight, Darko. And don\u0027t forget it\u0027s only one of their satellites you\u0027ve punished, one of the men they always find to do their dirty work. Mark you,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027I quite agree about the Russians. They simply don\u0027t understand the carrot. Only the stick has any effect. Basically they\u0027re masochists. They love the knout. That\u0027s why they were so happy under Stalin. He gave it them. I\u0027m not sure how they\u0027re going to react to the scraps of carrot they\u0027re being fed by Khrushchev and Co. As for England, the trouble today is that carrots for all are the fashion. At home and abroad. We don\u0027t show teeth any more–only gums.\u0027 Kerim laughed harshly, but made no comment. They were climbing back up the stinking alley and there was no breath for talk. They rested at the top and then walked slowly towards the trees of the Hippodrome Square. \u0027So you forgive me for today?\u0027 It was odd to hear the longing for reassurance in the big man\u0027s usually boisterous voice. \u0027Forgive you? Forgive what? Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\u0027 There was affection in Bond\u0027s voice. \u0027You\u0027ve got a job to do and you\u0027re doing it. I\u0027ve been very impressed. You\u0027ve got a wonderful set-up here. I\u0027m the one who ought to apologize. I seem to have brought a great deal of trouble down on your head. And you\u0027ve dealt with it. I\u0027ve just tagged along behind. And I\u0027ve got absolutely nowhere with my main job. M will be getting pretty impatient. Perhaps there\u0027ll be some sort of message at the hotel.\u0027 But when Kerim took Bond back to the hotel and went with him to the desk there was nothing for Bond. Kerim clapped him on the back. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, my friend,\u0027 he said cheerfully. \u0027Hope makes a good breakfast. Eat plenty of it. I will send the car in the morning and if nothing has happened I will think of some more little adventures to pass the time. Clean your gun and sleep on it. You both deserve a rest.\u0027 Bond climbed the few stairs and unlocked his door and locked and bolted it behind him. Moonlight filtered through the curtains. He walked across and turned on the pink-shaded lights on the dressing-table. He stripped off his clothes and went into the bathroom and stood for a few minutes under the shower. He thought how much more eventful Saturday the fourteenth had been than Friday the thirteenth. He cleaned his teeth and gargled with a sharp mouthwash to get rid of the taste of the day and turned off the bathroom light and went back into the bedroom. Bond drew aside one curtain and opened wide the tall windows and stood, holding the curtains open and looking out across the great boomerang curve of water under the riding moon. The night breeze felt wonderfully cool on his naked body. He looked at his watch. It said two o\u0027clock. Bond gave a shuddering yawn. He let the curtains drop back into place. He bent to switch off the lights on the dressing-table. Suddenly he stiffened and his heart missed a beat. There had been a nervous giggle from the shadows at the back of the room. A girl\u0027s voice said, \u0027Poor Mister Bond. You must be tired. Come to bed.\u0027 Chapter Twenty Black on Pink Bond whirled round. He looked over to the bed, but his eyes were blind from gazing at the moon. He crossed the room and turned on the pink-shaded light by the bed. There was a long body under the single sheet. Brown hair was spread out on the pillow. The tips of fingers showed, holding the sheet up over the face. Lower down the breasts stood up like hills under snow. Bond laughed shortly. He leaned forward and gave the hair a soft tug. There was a squeak of protest from under the sheet. Bond sat down on the edge of the bed. After a moment\u0027s silence a corner of the sheet was cautiously lowered and one large blue eye inspected him. \u0027You look very improper.\u0027 The voice was muffled by the sheet. \u0027What about you! And how did you get here?\u0027 \u0027I walked down two floors. I live here too.\u0027 The voice was deep and provocative. There was very little accent. \u0027Well, I\u0027m going to get into bed.\u0027 The sheet came quickly down to the chin and the girl pulled herself up on the pillows. She was blushing. \u0027Oh no. You mustn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s my bed. And anyway you told me to.\u0027 The face was incredibly beautiful. Bond examined it coolly. The blush deepened.\u0027 \u0027That was only a phrase. To introduce myself.\u0027 \u0027Well I\u0027m very glad to meet you. My name\u0027s James Bond.\u0027 \u0027Mine\u0027s Tatiana Romanova.\u0027 She sounded the second A of Tatiana and the first A of Romanova very long. \u0027My friends call me Tania.\u0027 There was a pause while they looked at each other, the girl with curiosity, and with what might have been relief. Bond with cool surmise. She was the first to break the silence. \u0027You look just like your photographs,\u0027 she blushed again. \u0027But you must put something on. It upsets me.\u0027 \u0027You upset me just as much. That\u0027s called sex. If I got into bed with you it wouldn\u0027t matter. Anyway, what have you got on?\u0027 She pulled the sheet a fraction lower to show a quarter-inch black velvet ribbon round her neck. \u0027This.\u0027 Bond looked down into the teasing blue eyes, now wide as if asking if the ribbon was inadequate. He felt his body getting out of control. \u0027Damn you, Tania. Where are the rest of your things? Or did you come down in the lift like that?\u0027 \u0027Oh no. That would not have been kulturny. They are under the bed.\u0027 \u0027Well, if you think you are going to get out of this room without . . .\u0027 Bond left the sentence unfinished. He got up from the bed and went to put on one of the dark blue silk pyjama coats he wore instead of pyjamas. \u0027What you are suggesting is not kulturny.\u0027 \u0027Oh isn\u0027t it,\u0027 said Bond sarcastically. He came back to the bed and pulled up a chair beside it. He smiled down at her. \u0027Well I\u0027ll tell you something kulturny. You\u0027re one of the most beautiful women in the world.\u0027 The girl blushed again. She looked at him seriously. \u0027Are you speaking the truth? I think my mouth is too big. Am I as beautiful as Western girls? I was once told I look like Greta Garbo. Is that so?\u0027 \u0027More beautiful,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027There is more light in your face. And your mouth isn\u0027t too big. It\u0027s just the right size. For me, anyway.\u0027 \u0027What is that–\u0027\u0027light in the face\u0027\u0027? What do you mean?\u0027 Bond meant that she didn\u0027t look to him like a Russian spy. She seemed to show none of the reserve of a spy. None of the coldness, none of the calculation. She gave the impression of warmth of heart and gaiety. These things shone out through the eyes. He searched for a non-committal phrase. \u0027There is a lot of gaiety and fun in your eyes,\u0027 he said lamely. Tatiana looked serious. \u0027That is curious,\u0027 she said. \u0027There is not much fun and gaiety in Russia. No one speaks of these things. I have never been told that before.\u0027 Gaiety? she thought, after the last two months? How could she be looking gay? And yet, yes, there was a lightness in her heart. Was she a loose woman by nature? Or was it something to do with this man she had never seen before? Relief about him after the agony of thinking about what she had to do? It was certainly much easier than she had expected. He made it easy–made it fun, with a spice of danger. He was terribly handsome. And he looked very clean. Would he forgive her when they got to London and she told him? Told him that she had been sent to seduce him? Even the night on which she must do it and the number of the room? Surely he wouldn\u0027t mind very much. It was doing him no harm. It was only a way for her to get to England and make those reports. \u0027Gaiety and fun in her eyes.\u0027 Well, why not? It was possible. There was a wonderful sense of freedom being alone with a man like this and knowing that she would not be punished for it. It was really terribly exciting. \u0027You are very handsome,\u0027 she said. She searched for a comparison that would give him pleasure. \u0027You are like an American film star.\u0027 She was startled by his reaction. \u0027For God\u0027s sake! That\u0027s the worst insult you can pay a man!\u0027 She hurried to make good her mistake. How curious that the compliment didn\u0027t please him. Didn\u0027t everyone in the West want to look like a film star? \u0027I was lying,\u0027 she said. \u0027I wanted to give you pleasure. In fact you are like my favourite hero. He\u0027s in a book by a Russian called Lermontov. I will tell you about him one day.\u0027 One day ? Bond thought it was time to get down to business. \u0027Now listen, Tania.\u0027 He tried not to look at the beautiful face on the pillow. He fixed his eyes on the point of her chin. \u0027We\u0027ve got to stop fooling and be serious. What is all this about? Are you really going to come back to England with me?\u0027 He raised his eyes to hers. It was fatal. She had opened them wide again in that damnable guilelessness. \u0027But of course!\u0027 \u0027Oh!\u0027 Bond was taken aback by the directness of her answer. He looked at her suspiciously. \u0027You\u0027re sure?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 Her eyes were truthful now. She had stopped flirting. \u0027You\u0027re not afraid?\u0027 He saw a shadow cross her eyes. But it was not what he thought. She had remembered that she had a part to play. She was to be frightened of what she was doing. Terrified. It had sounded so easy, this acting, but now it was difficult. How odd! She decided to compromise. \u0027Yes. I am afraid. But not so much now. You will protect me. I thought you would.\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, of course I will.\u0027 Bond thought of her relatives in Russia. He quickly put the thought out of his mind. What was he doing? Trying to dissuade her from coming? He closed his mind to the consequences he imagined for her. \u0027There\u0027s nothing to worry about. I\u0027ll look after you.\u0027 And now for the question he had been shirking. He felt a ridiculous embarrassment. This girl wasn\u0027t in the least what he had expected. It was spoiling everything to ask the question. It had to be done. \u0027What about the machine?\u0027 Yes. It was as if he had cuffed her across the face. Pain showed in her eyes, and the edge of tears. She pulled the sheet over her mouth and spoke from behind it. Her eyes above the sheet were cold. \u0027So that\u0027s what you want.\u0027 \u0027Now listen.\u0027 Bond put nonchalance in his voice. \u0027This machine\u0027s got nothing to do with you and me. But my people in London want it.\u0027 He remembered security. He added blandly. \u0027It\u0027s not all that important. They know all about the machine and they think it\u0027s a wonderful Russian invention. They just want one to copy. Like your people copy foreign cameras and things.\u0027 God, how lame it sounded!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-russia-with-love-james-bond-5/page-25.html","bookId":1548,"book":{"id":1548,"title":"From Russia With Love (James Bond #5)","description":"Storyline: From Russia With Love (James Bond (Original Series) #5) Every major foreign government organization has a file on British secret agent James Bond.
