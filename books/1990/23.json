That’s all I’m saying.”\\n\\n Krit shoved away from me and started pacing. “Fuck that. It’s not fair, Jess. I was drinking. I get horny as hell when I’m onstage. It gets my blood pumping. You know that.”\\n\\n I grinned this time. I couldn’t help it. “I know. And I’m telling you it’s okay. I just have other things going on right now I have to deal with.”\\n\\n Krit stopped pacing and bent down and picked up the papers he had thrown down: several articles from an event this weekend, where Jax Stone and Star had performed for charity. But the photos weren’t of Jax. They were of Star, and on her arm was Jason.\\n\\n “This is what you’re dealing with. This little shit. He used you. He’s fucking with your head. I saw you looking at him last weekend. You wanted him. I could taste it on you. Don’t let him fuck you up. He can’t be what you want, love. Hell, I have a hard time being what you want. You want a fucking lot. You deserve it, but he won’t be the one to do it.”\\n\\n Krit started to say more and stopped. Instead he turned around and walked to his car. I didn’t watch him go. I was too busy staring at the photo of Jason and Star taken on Friday night. The same night he had called me. He had said he was going out with Sadie and Jax. He hadn’t been lying. He’d just left out the small piece of information that he was dating Star.\\n\\n Krit was right. I was wanting a fairy tale. I wasn’t getting a fairy tale. I was a stripper’s daughter. Nothing more. I was trying to be someone I wasn’t. Someone I would never be. I started to wad the paper up and stopped myself. Instead I smoothed it out. I would put it away, and when I needed reminding of just how stupid I was when it came to Jason, I would pull it out again. Remind myself.\\n\\n Friday night I spent extra time getting ready. I wore my shortest skirt and my tightest top. I even finished it off with the expensive boots Jason had bought me. I hadn’t been able to wear them again. But I was tired of acting like they were some shrine to him. I should be enjoying something from our time together.\\n\\n My hair looked good down tonight, and I put extra eye makeup on to give me a sultry look. By now everyone would know Krit and I were over and I was free to flirt and be flirted with. It was rebound night for me, and I planned on drinking too much and dancing all night.\\n\\n When I walked into Live Bay, the night was already in full swing. I stopped by the bar and grabbed a whiskey before heading over to the table where Rock was watching me with a concerned, fatherly frown. I just winked at him, which made his frown deepen. I shifted my gaze to Dewayne, who was the only other person at the table right now. Licking my bottom lip suggestively, I set my glass down and leaned forward, knowing that even though he viewed me as Rock’s little cousin, he was going to look at my tits.\\n\\n “Wanna dance?” I asked.\\n\\n “No,” Rock answered for him.\\n\\n “Hell yes,” Dewayne replied.\\n\\n “Stand up and I’ll make you sit down,” Rock warned him.\\n\\n Dewayne just laughed and took a drink.\\n\\n “What are you doing, Jess?” Rock asked.\\n\\n “Drinking, then dancing,” I replied with a smile I didn’t feel.\\n\\n “It’s not like you,” he replied.\\n\\n “No. It’s exactly like me. This is me, Rock. I’m done pretending to be someone else. Now, why can’t Dewayne dance with me?” I asked, turning to pout at Dewayne, who looked very amused.\\n\\n “Stop flirting with Dewayne,” Rock said, annoyed.\\n\\n “I’m enjoying it. Please, let her continue,” Dewayne said, leaning back to look at me through half-hooded eyes as he smoked a cigarette.\\n\\n Maybe I should be careful with him. He seemed like he might just be more than I could handle. “Fine. I’ll go dance by myself,” I told them, taking a long swig of my drink before turning and walking out to the dance floor.\\n\\n I made sure to swing my hips just enough to draw attention. I wouldn’t dance alone for long. This was what I was good at. I had watched my momma control men my entire life. It came easy to me.\\n\\n “Heard you and Krit are over,” a deep voice said as warm fingers circled my arm. I turned to see Justin Monroe. He had been the senior quarterback in high school my freshman year.\\n\\n “Yeah, we are,” I replied with a flutter of my eyelashes and a slow smile. “But I just want to dance.”\\n\\n Justin grinned. “Lead the way,” he said.\\n\\n I walked us into the center of the crowd. Luckily, this was Green’s song. He sang the solo on it, so I didn’t have to hear Krit singing while I adjusted to my life after Jason Stone.\\n\\n Justin rested his hands on my hips, and I moved to the music while smiling up at him. He was a safe distraction. Nothing dangerous. He’d been engaged to the preacher’s daughter in town once, but that had fallen through. Not sure why. I didn’t hang out in their circle, and they were older than me.\\n\\n Green announced a break, and I stopped dancing when the radio took over playing music.\\n\\n “Need a drink,” I told him, and then I left him there while I went back to the table. I didn’t ask him to come with me. It had just been a dance, and he’d be one of many.\\n\\n Rock was shaking his head at me when he saw me coming.\\n\\n I picked up my drink. “What?” I snapped.\\n\\n “You’re stirring up trouble,” Rock said.\\n\\n I rolled my eyes and took a drink. “I’m dancing,” I replied.\\n\\n “And here he comes,” Dewayne drawled.\\n\\n I glanced back, expecting to see Justin, but Krit was headed our way instead. Hadn’t expected him. He normally had quickies backstage first.\\n\\n Krit’s hand wrapped around my arm and he pulled me to him. “We need to talk. Now.”\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n “I’ll cause a fucking scene,” Krit warned.\\n\\n “We discussed this. What’s wrong with you?”\\n\\n Two girls came up to Krit and grabbed on to both his arms and started telling him how good he sounded. He shrugged them loose. “Thanks. Now go,” he said, pulling me again. “I need to talk to you, love. Don’t make me do it here.”\\n\\n The girls walked away, scowling at me. I pointed my glass at their retreating backs. “You should go get them. I bet they’ll do a threesome,” I said.\\n\\n “Fuck, Jess,” Rock groaned.\\n\\n Krit got in my face, and I felt Rock move behind me. “Back up,” Rock warned him.\\n\\n “Is that what you want, love? You want me to leave and go fuck someone else backstage?” He wanted me to say no. I could hear it in his voice. But he needed me to say yes.\\n\\n “Yes, that’s what I want,” I replied, and he stepped back like I had slapped him.\\n\\n He wiped his thumb over his bottom lip and shook his head in disbelief. “That’s it, love. That’s it. I’m done.” He threw his hands up and stalked off. I didn’t watch him go. I turned back to the table and met Dewayne’s eyes.\\n\\n “He’ll get over it. You did the right thing. He ain’t for you,” Dewayne said.\\n\\n “I just hope we can be friends again one day.” I did. I shouldn’t have let things get out of hand with him. I also shouldn’t have come here. I didn’t belong here. I didn’t want this anymore. I set my glass down. “I’m gone,” I said.\\n\\n “You okay?” Rock asked.\\n\\n I looked up at him. “Yeah. No. I don’t know. I just . . .” I looked around at the place. “I don’t want to do this anymore,” I told him. “I want more now.”\\n\\n Rock pulled me into a hug. “You’ll get more,” he whispered into my hair.\\n\\n I pulled back and forced a smile. “I hope so.”\\n\\n Turning to leave, I walked to the door and ignored people who called out my name. I just needed fresh air and time alone. Right before I reached the door, it opened and Jason Stone walked in. His eyes locked on me, and we stood there staring at each other. I hadn’t spoken to him all week. Not since his call.\\n\\n He stepped back and opened the door for me. I walked through, keeping my head down. Should I say something? Or was he going to stay inside without a word?\\n\\n The door closed behind me. I spun around to see Jason outside. He nodded toward the parking lot. “Can we talk?”\\n\\n All I could do was nod. Even if I should be leaving here and protecting myself.\\n\\n We walked over to his Hummer. This time there was no limo, no driver. Just him. He opened the door for me, and I climbed in, realizing that this was something Krit had never done. Opened my car door. I had missed it.\\n\\n I thanked him, and he just smiled before closing the door and walking over to the driver’s side. The Hummer smelled like him. I breathed in deeply and enjoyed it before he opened the door and climbed in.\\n\\n “Were you leaving?” he asked.\\n\\n I turned to look at him, and seeing his face only made my heart speed up. His gaze was focused on me, and just being this close to him made everything seem better.\\n\\n “Yeah,” I replied, not sure how much I should tell him.\\n\\n He glanced out the window, then back at me. “Is he going to come looking for you?”\\n\\n I shook my head. “No. We ended that . . . whatever it was.”\\n\\n His eyes widened and his shoulders visibly relaxed. “Why?”\\n\\n Did he want me to tell him it was because of him? Not that I would. I shrugged. “We don’t fit, I guess,” I replied.\\n\\n Jason nodded like he agreed. I bit back a smile.\\n\\n “Where were you headed?”\\n\\n “Home,” I replied honestly, even if it made me sound pathetic.\\n\\n “Could I convince you to come back to my place?”\\n\\n God, how I wanted to say yes. He could convince me of anything if he tried hard enough. But the regret that would come when he left and didn’t call . . . The pain was something too fresh. I wasn’t ready for that again. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea.”\\n\\n Jason leaned toward me and kept his intense gaze focused on me. “Why?”\\n\\n “Because you’ll make me miss you.” I said it before I could stop myself.\\n\\n He reached over and touched my hand. “That’s why I want to talk. The way we left things . . . I don’t like it.”\\n\\n I didn’t respond. I didn’t want to misunderstand him.\\n\\n “I miss you, Jess,” he said in a husky whisper. That was my undoing.\\n\\n “Okay.”\\n\\n He raised his eyebrows. “Okay . . . you’ll go back to my place?”\\n\\n I nodded and he let out a sigh. “Good. I was trying to weigh my options and abduction seemed risky.” The grin on his face brought the first real smile to mine in a week.\\n\\n JASON\\n\\n I had never been more relieved to get out of a car in my life. If Jess crossed her legs one more time in that ridiculous excuse for a skirt, I was going to lose my mind. Damn, why did she have to be so fucking sexy?\\n\\n I tried not to look at her as we climbed the steps to the house. The outfit she was wearing was more adventurous than anything I’d ever seen her wear. How the hell she’d walked out of the club alone was beyond me.\\n\\n I opened the door and she walked inside. The staff was gone for the night since Jax wasn’t in residence. I liked it better alone. Especially now that I had Jess here. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/misbehaving-sea-breeze-6/page-23.html","bookId":1990,"book":{"id":1990,"title":"Misbehaving (Sea Breeze #6)","description":"Storyline: Misbehaving (Sea Breeze #6) \\n An unexpected affair leads to mind-blowing harmony in this Sea Breeze novel from New York Times bestselling author Abbi Glines. \\n Jason is sick of living in his rock star brother’s shadow.
