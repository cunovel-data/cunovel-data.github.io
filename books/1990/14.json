The idea of going to that party without her hadn’t seemed appealing, though. I also couldn’t stand the idea of leaving her here with that idiot. I didn’t trust the guy, and the way he played on Jess’s emotions pissed me off. “I’m a little worried about flying. I’ve never been on a plane before. Not sure if I will panic or not, but I thought I should warn you,” she said, and twisted the bottle of water around in her hands nervously. I couldn’t help but stare at her. She had seriously never flown before? Wow. Had I ever met anyone who had never flown before? “Does that mean this is your first time to New York too?” I asked, assuming she wouldn’t drive that far. She smirked, and one corner of her ridiculously plump lips lifted. “Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana are the extent of my travels. If I can’t get there by car in about three hours, then I’ve never been.” Why did I like it so much that I was taking her somewhere she’d never been? Her tempting mouth had broken into a full smile now, and I couldn’t seem to ignore it anymore. Reaching over, I cupped her face and reminded myself just how good Jess’s lips felt pressed against mine. Her hands went instantly to my hair, and she opened her mouth under mine, allowing me a taste without my even asking. The minty taste of her toothpaste met my tongue, and she pressed her chest against mine. We had a twenty-minute ride to the private airstrip, and I suddenly knew exactly how I wanted to spend it. “Straddle me,” I told her as I broke the kiss and reached for her waist to move her hot little body over mine. She threw a leg over mine and made the transition so smoothly and with such ease, I pushed all thoughts about why she was so good at that away. I didn’t like thinking about her with other guys, although I knew there had to have been many. Jess was a flirt, and I didn’t know a guy who would turn her down. I stopped kissing her neck and took a deep breath. Shit. The guys at this party were going to be all over her. I hadn’t thought of that. She was different from the same group we always ran in. She would make all the other girls seem less interesting. I wasn’t sharing her. I had just wanted her with me. Jess pulled back and started to move off my lap. I held her there and she stilled. “At the party, you’re with me,” I told her as I lifted my head to look at her. She frowned, then nodded. “Okay,” she replied. I could see the uncertainty in her face. She didn’t understand what I was saying. “It’s different from your world. The partying may be in nicer places, but the crowd isn’t more refined. They don’t do well with boundaries. Guys are going to hit on you. A lot. A whole helluva lot.” Jess’s eyes widened, and she sat back on my lap as her gaze hardened. “And what? I won’t be able to resist throwing myself into the arms of any guy who hits on me? Really? That’s what you think?” She started to move again, and I held her waist, making it impossible for her to move away. “No. That’s not what I think. I wanted you to be aware that they’re going to be intrigued by you. You’re not like the girls in our circle. I just . . . I’m not going to handle it well if you give anyone else too much attention.” Jess’s body eased some as she studied me. I held her gaze and the anger seemed to be melting. Finally she placed a hand on my chest. “Why would I want to give anyone else attention when I’m with you?” I liked that answer, but she still didn’t understand the world she was about to enter. “You’ll recognize some faces. Not everyone is famous, but they’re all part of a world where they are connected to celebrities.” She leaned forward and pressed a kiss beside my ear. “I’m not saying I won’t be silently blown away to be meeting famous people or those connected to famous people. But I’m with you because I like you,” she whispered in my ear, then wrapped her arms around my neck. “Now kiss me again, please.” I glanced down, unable to ignore the low-cut shirt she was wearing, and I was pretty damn sure she was braless. Groaning as she rocked her hips and sank down in my lap, I leaned forward and pulled her bottom lip into my mouth and bit down before sucking on it. Damn lips of hers were driving me crazy. Chapter Eleven JESS When the limo stopped, I was topless. Jason lifted his head from the attention he was giving my breasts and pressed a button. “Give us about five minutes,” he said. “Yes sir,” Kane replied. I had to bite my lip to keep from asking him if we could spend four of those minutes with his mouth back on me. His hands came up and cupped both of my swollen breasts. “Really don’t want you to put your shirt back on,” he said with a wicked grin on his face. I didn’t want him to either. “I’m thinking Kane would appreciate it,” I replied. Jason reached for the shirt he had taken off of me. “You’re wrong there. Kane would appreciate this view. It would make his day.” The teasing grin on his face made me laugh. I let him dress me since he seemed to be intent on doing it. Once he had my shirt back on, he brushed my nipples through the fabric. “Damn, these are nice.” I had always liked my body. My momma had given me the body and looks that I used to my advantage. But right now I was thankful for them for a completely different reason. Jason was attracted to me. He wanted me. “You ready to fly?” he asked, moving his hands down to my waist again. I wanted to say yes, but I wasn’t sure. So I shrugged. Jason leaned forward and pressed a kiss to my mouth. “I’ll distract you if you get nervous.” The idea of him distracting me made the thought of getting on the plane much more appealing. “Promise?” I asked, looking up at him through my lashes. Jason chuckled and shook his head. “Don’t flirt with me, Jess. I already want you. Flirting just makes it worse.” There was a knock on the door, and Jason moved me off his lap before knocking back. He reached for my hand as the door opened. We climbed out, and Jason nodded to Kane before we headed to the jet. There was a lady standing at the bottom of the steps with her arms behind her back, standing straight. Jason stopped and looked at her. “We won’t be needing you during the flight. I’d like privacy,” he said as he moved me in front of him and I headed up the stairs. I stopped just inside, and Jason came up behind me and slid his hands around my waist. “Go on in,” he said close to my ear. I walked inside and took in the place. Black leather sofas lined the inside, and a bar sat at the back. From here I could see it was completely stocked. A massive flat screen covered the wall on the other end. “Have a seat. Get comfortable,” Jason said, taking my hand and pulling me over to sink onto the leather. “Wow” was all I could think of to say. I knew I needed to say something, but this was beyond what I had expected. Jason glanced over at the bar and back at me. “You want a drink? One that will calm your nerves?” That would have been nice, but I also didn’t want to get sick. What if I had motion sickness and didn’t know it? I shook my head and looked outside the tinted windows. Jason came over and sat down beside me. “Nervous?” I nodded. “And excited.” “Good combination,” he replied. Yes, it was. The door we had entered through closed, and the lady he had spoken to locked it, then looked over at Jason. “The bar is stocked, sir. I’ll be in the cockpit. If you need me, just ring.” “Thanks,” Jason told her, then leaned back against the seat and stretched his arms across the back. The lady left the room, closing another door behind her. “I’m going to be good since this is your first flight. I want you to enjoy it. But the moment you need a distraction, just let me know and we’ll take up where we left off in the limo.” My stomach fluttered. I loved the way Jason’s hands and mouth felt on me. I tried not to look too anxious and kept my eyes focused on the window. But my body flushed. I didn’t want him to get tired of me too soon. I knew that day was coming, and I wanted to postpone it. Being with Jason made me happy. He didn’t judge me and he made me smile. When he touched me, it was different from how I had been touched before. He wasn’t in a hurry or focused on getting himself off. He took his time as if he enjoyed touching me. Like he wanted to enjoy every second. The jet began to move and all other thoughts fled. I reached for Jason and grabbed the first thing I could find, which was his leg. I held it tightly. Jason immediately moved closer, and his arm curled around me, but he didn’t do anything more. His closeness helped but my heart was still pounding. Soon we were speeding down the runway and Jason was holding me close enough that his warm breath tickled my neck. I sank back into him and closed my eyes as we left the ground. “Breathe,” Jason whispered in my ear, and I realized I was holding my breath. I sucked in some air and he laughed softly. “You sure you don’t want that drink?” he asked. I shook my head and opened my eyes to stare down at the ground, which was getting farther and farther away. When we broke through the clouds, I gasped and squeezed Jason’s arm, which was now wrapped around me. He nuzzled my neck. “God, you’re too damn sexy to be this cute. It’s supposed to be one or the other, not both.” Smiling, I leaned back into him and relaxed. No one had ever called me cute before. Why did I like it so much? His hands moved back up and over my breasts. “I want your shirt off again. It’s all I can think about. Knowing you’re not wearing a bra is messing with my head,” he said as he kissed my neck and the curve of my shoulder. “Take it off,” I said, sitting up and lifting my arms. Jason let out a groan and pulled the shirt up, then reached around the front of me and pulled me back against his chest again and continued taking small bites of my neck, then soothing it with a kiss. His large, warm hands held my breasts, and they felt heavy and needy. I was more than a handful even for his big hands, and I liked it. “You smell incredible,” he murmured as he kissed my shoulder and ran the tip of his nose against my skin. I couldn’t keep from trembling. “Stand up,” he said, leaning back and helping me up on my weak legs. He stood me in front of him and began pulling the zipper on my blue jean skirt down, then tugged at it until it fell to the ground. I stepped out of it and waited on him. He reached out and ran a finger over the wet spot on my white satin panties. I had made sure to bring my sexiest underwear. These had very little fabric, and I loved the way they felt. Seeing his finger slide over the crotch, which was obviously soaked, made it harder to stand. Especially in the heels I was wearing. As if he could read my thoughts, he slipped his hands into the sides of the panties and pulled them down slowly. I lifted each foot and he pulled the panties off completely. He stared down at the red heels I was wearing, then lifted his eyes to me. We stood there staring at each other for a long moment before he stood up in front of me and touched my body, gently running his hands down my sides, being sure not to touch me where I wanted him to the most.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/misbehaving-sea-breeze-6/page-14.html","bookId":1990,"book":{"id":1990,"title":"Misbehaving (Sea Breeze #6)","description":"Storyline: Misbehaving (Sea Breeze #6) An unexpected affair leads to mind-blowing harmony in this Sea Breeze novel from New York Times bestselling author Abbi Glines.
