{"id":40520,"no":2,"title":"The Gay Old Dog [1917]","content":"Those of you who have dwelt—or even lingered—in Chicago, Illinois, are familiar with the region known as the Loop. For those others of you to whom Chicago is a transfer point between New York and California there is presented this brief explanation: \\n\\n \\n\\n The Loop is a clamorous, smoke-infested district embraced by the iron arms of the elevated tracks. In a city boasting fewer millions, it would be known familiarly as downtown. From Congress to Lake Street, from Wabash almost to the river, those thunderous tracks make a complete circle, or loop. Within it lie the retail shops, the commercial hotels, the theaters, the restaurants. It is the Fifth Avenue and the Broadway of Chicago. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he who frequents it by night in search of amusement and cheer is known, vulgarly, as a Loop-hound. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo Hertz was a Loop-hound. On the occasion of those sparse first nights granted the metropolis of the Middle West he was always present, third row, aisle, left. When a new Loop cafe\u0027 was opened, Jo\u0027s table always commanded an unobstructed view of anything worth viewing. On entering he was wont to say, \"Hello, Gus,\" with careless cordiality to the headwaiter, the while his eye roved expertly from table to table as he removed his gloves. He ordered things under glass, so that his table, at midnight or thereabouts, resembled a hotbed that favors the bell system. The waiters fought for him. He was the kind of man who mixes his own salad dressing. He liked to call for a bowl, some cracked ice, lemon, garlic, paprika, salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil and make a rite of it. People at near-by tables would lay down their knives and forks to watch, fascinated. The secret of it seemed to lie in using all the oil in sight and calling for more. \\n\\n \\n\\n That was Jo—a plump and lonely bachelor of fifty. A plethoric, roving-eyed, and kindly man, clutching vainly at the garments of a youth that had long slipped past him. Jo Hertz, in one of those pinch-waist suits and a belted coat and a little green hat, walking up Michigan Avenue of a bright winter\u0027s afternoon, trying to take the curb with a jaunty youthfulness against which every one of his fat-encased muscles rebelled, was a sight for mirth or pity, depending on one\u0027s vision. \\n\\n \\n\\n The gay-dog business was a late phase in the life of Jo Hertz. He had been a quite different sort of canine. The staid and harassed brother of three unwed and selfish sisters is an underdog. \\n\\n \\n\\n At twenty-seven Jo had been the dutiful, hard-working son (in the wholesale harness business) of a widowed and gummidging mother, who called him Joey. Now and then a double wrinkle would appear between Jo\u0027s eyes—a wrinkle that had no business there at twenty-seven. Then Jo\u0027s mother died, leaving him handicapped by a deathbed promise, the three sisters, and a three-story-and-basement house on Calumet Avenue. Jo\u0027s wrinkle became a fixture. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Joey,\" his mother had said, in her high, thin voice, \"take care of the girls.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will, Ma,\" Jo had choked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Joey,\" and the voice was weaker, \"promise me you won\u0027t marry till the girls are all provided for.\" Then as Jo had hesitated, appalled: \"Joey, it\u0027s my dying wish. Promise!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I promise, Ma,\" he had said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereupon his mother had died, comfortably, leaving him with a completely ruined life. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were not bad-looking girls, and they had a certain style, too. That is, Stell and Eva had. Carrie, the middle one, taught school over on the West Side. In those days it took her almost two hours each way. She said the kind of costume she required should have been corrugated steel. But all three knew what was being worn, and they wore it—or fairly faithful copies of it. Eva, the housekeeping sister, had a needle knack. She could skim the State Street windows and come away with a mental photograph of every separate tuck, hem, yoke, and ribbon. Heads of departments showed her the things they kept in drawers, and she went home and reproduced them with the aid of a seamstress by the day. Stell, the youngest, was the beauty. They called her Babe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Twenty-three years ago one\u0027s sisters did not strain at the household leash, nor crave a career. Carrie taught school, and hated it. Eva kept house expertly and complainingly. Babe\u0027s profession was being the family beauty, and it took all her spare time. Eva always let her sleep until ten. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was Jo\u0027s household, and he was the nominal head of it. But it was an empty title. The three women dominated his life. They weren\u0027t consciously selfish. If you had called them cruel they would have put you down as mad. When you are the lone brother of three sisters, it means that you must constantly be calling for, escorting, or dropping one of them somewhere. Most men of Jo\u0027s age were standing before their mirror of a Saturday night, whistling blithely and abstractedly while they discarded a blue polka-dot for a maroon tie, whipped off the maroon for a shot-silk and at the last moment decided against the shot-silk in favor of a plain black-and-white because she had once said she preferred quiet ties. Jo, when he should have been preening his feathers for conquest, was saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, my God, I AM hurrying! Give a man time, can\u0027t you? I just got home. You girls been laying around the house all day. No wonder you\u0027re ready.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He took a certain pride in seeing his sisters well dressed, at a time when he should have been reveling in fancy waistcoats and brilliant-hued socks, according to the style of that day and the inalienable right of any unwed male under thirty, in any day. On those rare occasions when his business necessitated an out-of-town trip, he would spend half a day floundering about the shops selecting handkerchiefs, or stockings, or feathers, or gloves for the girls. They always turned out to be the wrong kind, judging by their reception. \\n\\n \\n\\n From Carrie, \"What in the world do I want of long white gloves!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought you didn\u0027t have any,\" Jo would say. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t. I never wear evening clothes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo would pass a futile hand over the top of his head, as was his way when disturbed. \"I just thought you\u0027d like them. I thought every girl liked long white gloves. Just,\" feebly, \"just to—to have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, for pity\u0027s sake!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And from Eva or Babe, \"I\u0027ve GOT silk stockings, Jo.\" Or, \"You brought me handkerchiefs the last time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was something selfish in his giving, as there always is in any gift freely and joyfully made. They never suspected the exquisite pleasure it gave him to select these things, these fine, soft, silken things. There were many things about this slow-going, amiable brother of theirs that they never suspected. If you had told them he was a dreamer of dreams, for example, they would have been amused. Sometimes, dead-tired by nine o\u0027clock after a hard day downtown, he would doze over the evening paper. At intervals he would wake, red-eyed, to a snatch of conversation such as, \"Yes, but if you get a blue you can wear it anywhere. It\u0027s dressy, and at the same time it\u0027s quiet, too.\" Eva, the expert, wrestling with Carrie over the problem of the new spring dress. They never guessed that the commonplace man in the frayed old smoking jacket had banished them all from the room long ago; had banished himself, for that matter. In his place was a tall, debonair, and rather dangerously handsome man to whom six o\u0027clock spelled evening clothes. The kind of man who can lean up against a mantel, or propose a toast, or give an order to a manservant, or whisper a gallant speech in a lady\u0027s ear with equal ease. The shabby old house on Calumet Avenue was transformed into a brocaded and chandeliered rendezvous for the brilliance of the city. Beauty was here, and wit. But none so beautiful and witty as She. Mrs.—er—Jo Hertz. There was wine, of course; but no vulgar display. There was music; the soft sheen of satin; laughter. And he, the gracious, tactful host, king of his own domain—— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jo, for heaven\u0027s sake, if you\u0027re going to snore, go to bed!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why—did I fall asleep?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t been doing anything else all evening. A person would think you were fifty instead of thirty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Jo Hertz was again just the dull, gray, commonplace brother of three well-meaning sisters. \\n\\n \\n\\n Babe used to say petulantly, \"Jo, why don\u0027t you ever bring home any of your men friends? A girl might as well not have any brother, all the good you do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo, conscience-stricken, did his best to make amends. But a man who has been petticoat-ridden for years loses the knack, somehow, of comradeship with men. \\n\\n \\n\\n One Sunday in May Jo came home from a late-Sunday-afternoon walk to find company for supper. Carrie often had in one of her schoolteacher friends, or Babe one of her frivolous intimates, or even Eva a staid guest of the old-girl type. There was always a Sunday-night supper of potato salad, and cold meat, and coffee, and perhaps a fresh cake. Jo rather enjoyed it, being a hospitable soul. But he regarded the guests with the undazzled eyes of a man to whom they were just so many petticoats, timid of the night streets and requiring escort home. If you had suggested to him that some of his sisters\u0027 popularity was due to his own presence, or if you had hinted that the more kittenish of these visitors were probably making eyes at him, he would have stared in amazement and unbelief. \\n\\n \\n\\n This Sunday night it turned out to be one of Carrie\u0027s friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Emily,\" said Carrie, \"this is my brother, Jo.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo had learned what to expect in Carrie\u0027s friends. Drab-looking women in the late thirties, whose facial lines all slanted downward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Happy to meet you,\" said Jo, and looked down at a different sort altogether. A most surprisingly different sort, for one of Carrie\u0027s friends. This Emily person was very small, and fluffy, and blue-eyed, and crinkly looking. The corners of her mouth when she smiled, and her eyes when she looked up at you, and her hair, which was brown, but had the miraculous effect, somehow, of looking golden. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo shook hands with her. Her hand was incredibly small, and soft, so that you were afraid of crushing it, until you discovered she had a firm little grip all her own. It surprised and amused you, that grip, as does a baby\u0027s unexpected clutch on your patronizing forefinger. As Jo felt it in his own big clasp, the strangest thing happened to him. Something inside Jo Hertz stopped working for a moment, then lurched sickeningly, then thumped like mad. It was his heart. He stood staring down at her, and she up at him, until the others laughed. Then their hands fell apart, lingeringly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you a schoolteacher, Emily?\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kindergarten. It\u0027s my first year. And don\u0027t call me Emily, please.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not? It\u0027s your name. I think it\u0027s the prettiest name in the world.\" Which he hadn\u0027t meant to say at all. In fact, he was perfectly aghast to find himself saying it. But he meant it. \\n\\n \\n\\n At supper he passed her things, and stared, until everybody laughed again, and Eva said acidly, \"Why don\u0027t you feed her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It wasn\u0027t that Emily had an air of helplessness. She just made him feel he wanted her to be helpless, so that he could help her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo took her home, and from that Sunday night he began to strain at the leash. He took his sisters out, dutifully, but he would suggest, with a carelessness that deceived no one, \"Don\u0027t you want one of your girl friends to come along? That little What\u0027s-her-name-Emily, or something. So long\u0027s I\u0027ve got three of you, I might as well have a full squad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a long time he didn\u0027t know what was the matter with him. He only knew he was miserable, and yet happy. Sometimes his heart seemed to ache with an actual physical ache. He realized that he wanted to do things for Emily. He wanted to buy things for Emily—useless, pretty, expensive things that he couldn\u0027t afford. \\n\\n \\n\\n He wanted to buy everything that Emily needed, and everything that Emily desired. He wanted to marry Emily. That was it. He discovered that one day, with a shock, in the midst of a transaction in the harness business. He stared at the man with whom he was dealing until that startled person grew uncomfortable. \"What\u0027s the matter, Hertz?\" \"Matter?\" \"You look as if you\u0027d seen a ghost or found a gold mine. I don\u0027t know which.\" \"Gold mine,\" said Jo. And then, \"No. Ghost.\" For he remembered that high, thin voice, and his promise. And the harness business was slithering downhill with dreadful rapidity, as the automobile business began its amazing climb. Jo tried to stop it. But he was not that kind of businessman. It never occurred to him to jump out of the down-going vehicle and catch the up-going one. He stayed on, vainly applying brakes that refused to work. \"You know, Emily, I couldn\u0027t support two households now. Not the way things are. But if you\u0027ll wait. If you\u0027ll only wait. The girls might—that is, Babe and Carrie—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was a sensible little thing, Emily. \"Of course I\u0027ll wait. But we mustn\u0027t just sit back and let the years go by. We\u0027ve got to help.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She went about it as if she were already a little matchmaking matron. She corralled all the men she had ever known and introduced them to Babe, Carrie, and Eva separately, in pairs, and en masse. She got up picnics. She stayed home while Jo took the three about. When she was present she tried to look as plain and obscure as possible, so that the sisters should show up to advantage. She schemed, and planned, and contrived, and hoped; and smiled into Jo\u0027s despairing eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n And three years went by. Three precious years. Carrie still taught school, and hated it. Eva kept house more and more complainingly as prices advanced and allowance retreated. Stell was still Babe, the family beauty. Emily\u0027s hair, somehow, lost its glint and began to look just plain brown. Her crinkliness began to iron out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, look here!\" Jo argued, desperately, one night. \"We could be happy, anyway. There\u0027s plenty of room at the house. Lots of people begin that way. Of course, I couldn\u0027t give you all I\u0027d like to, at first. But maybe, after a while—\" No dreams of salons, and brocade, and velvet-footed servitors, and satin damask now. Just two rooms, all their own, all alone, and Emily to work for. That was his dream. But it seemed less possible than that other absurd one had been. \\n\\n \\n\\n Emily was as practical a little thing as she looked fluffy. She knew women. Especially did she know Eva, and Carrie, and Babe. She tried to imagine herself taking the household affairs and the housekeeping pocket-book out of Eva\u0027s expert hands. So then she tried to picture herself allowing the reins of Jo\u0027s house to remain in Eva\u0027s hands. And everything feminine and normal in her rebelled. Emily knew she\u0027d want to put away her own freshly laundered linen, and smooth it, and pat it. She was that kind of woman. She knew she\u0027d want to do her own delightful haggling with butcher and grocer. She knew she\u0027d want to muss Jo\u0027s hair, and sit on his knee, and even quarrel with him, if necessary, without the awareness of three ever-present pairs of maiden eyes and ears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No! No! We\u0027d only be miserable. I know. Even if they didn\u0027t object. And they would, Jo. Wouldn\u0027t they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His silence was miserable assent. Then, \"But you do love me, don\u0027t you, Emily?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do, Jo. I love you—and love you—and love you. But, Jo, I—can\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know it, dear. I knew it all the time, really. I just thought, maybe, somehow——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two sat staring for a moment into space, their hands clasped. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then they both shut their eyes with a little shudder, as though what they saw was terrible to look upon. Emily\u0027s hand, the tiny hand that was so unexpectedly firm, tightened its hold on his, and his crushed the absurd fingers until she winced with pain. \\n\\n \\n\\n That was the beginning of the end, and they knew it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Emily wasn\u0027t the kind of girl who would be left to pine. There are too many Jos in the world whose hearts are prone to lurch and then thump at the feel of a soft, fluttering, incredibly small hand in their grip. One year later Emily was married to a young man whose father owned a large, pie-shaped slice of the prosperous state of Michigan. \\n\\n \\n\\n That being safely accomplished, there was something grimly humorous in the trend taken by affairs in the old house on Calumet. For Eva married. Married well, too, though he was a great deal older than she. She went off in a hat she had copied from a French model at Field\u0027s, and a suit she had contrived with a home dressmaker, aided by pressing on the part of the little tailor in the basement over on Thirty-first Street. It was the last of that, though. The next time they saw her, she had on a hat that even she would have despaired of copying, and a suit that sort of melted into your gaze. She moved to the North Side (trust Eva for that), and Babe assumed the management of the household on Calumet Avenue. It was rather a pinched little household now, for the harness business shrank and shrank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how you can expect me to keep house decently on this!\" Babe would say contemptuously. Babe\u0027s nose, always a little inclined to sharpness, had whittled down to a point of late. \"If you knew what Ben gives Eva.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the best I can do, Sis. Business is something rotten.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ben says if you had the least bit of——\" Ben was Eva\u0027s husband, and quotable, as are all successful men. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care what Ben says,\" shouted Jo, goaded into rage. \"I\u0027m sick of your everlasting Ben. Go and get a Ben of your own, why don\u0027t you, if you\u0027re so stuck on the way he does things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Babe did. She made a last desperate drive, aided by Eva, and she captured a rather surprised young man in the brokerage way, who had made up his mind not to marry for years and years. Eva wanted to give her her wedding things, but at that Jo broke into sudden rebellion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir! No Ben is going to buy my sister\u0027s wedding clothes, understand? I guess I\u0027m not broke—yet. I\u0027ll furnish the money for her things, and there\u0027ll be enough of them, too.\" Babe had as useless a trousseau, and as filled with extravagant pink-and-blue and lacy and frilly things, as any daughter of doting parents. Jo seemed to find a grim pleasure in providing them. But it left him pretty well pinched. After Babe\u0027s marriage (she insisted that they call her Estelle now) Jo sold the house on Calumet. He and Carrie took one of those little flats that were springing up, seemingly overnight, all through Chicago\u0027s South Side. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was nothing domestic about Carrie. She had given up teaching two years before, and had gone into social-service work on the West Side. She had what is known as a legal mind—hard, clear, orderly—and she made a great success of it. Her dream was to live at the Settlement House and give all her time to the work. Upon the little household she bestowed a certain amount of grim, capable attention. It was the same kind of attention she would have given a piece of machinery whose oiling and running had been entrusted to her care. She hated it, and didn\u0027t hesitate to say so. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo took to prowling about department-store basements, and household goods sections. He was always sending home a bargain in a ham, or a sack of potatoes, or fifty pounds of sugar, or a window clamp, or a new kind of paring knife. He was forever doing odd jobs that the janitor should have done. It was the domestic in him claiming its own. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, one night, Carrie came home with a dull glow in her leathery cheeks, and her eyes alight with resolve. They had what she called a plain talk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen, Jo. They\u0027ve offered me the job of first assistant resident worker. And I\u0027m going to take it. Take it! I know fifty other girls who\u0027d give their ears for it. I go in next month.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They were at dinner. Jo looked up from his plate, dully. Then he glanced around the little dining room, with its ugly tan walls and its heavy, dark furniture (the Calumet Avenue pieces fitted cumbersomely into the five-room flat). \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Away? Away from here, you mean—to live?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Carrie laid down her fork. \"Well, really, Jo! After all that explanation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But to go over there to live! Why, that neighborhood\u0027s full of dirt, and disease, and crime, and the Lord knows what all. I can\u0027t let you do that, Carrie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Carrie\u0027s chin came up. She laughed a short little laugh. \"Let me! That\u0027s eighteenth-century talk, Jo. My life\u0027s my own to live. I\u0027m going.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And she went. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo stayed on in the apartment until the lease was up. Then he sold what furniture he could, stored or gave away the rest, and took a room on Michigan Avenue in one of the old stone mansions whose decayed splendor was being put to such purpose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo Hertz was his own master. Free to marry. Free to come and go. And he found he didn\u0027t even think of marrying. He didn\u0027t even want to come or go, particularly. A rather frumpy old bachelor, with thinning hair and a thickening neck. \\n\\n \\n\\n Every Thursday evening he took dinner at Eva\u0027s, and on Sunday noon at Stell\u0027s. He tucked his napkin under his chin and openly enjoyed the homemade soup and the well-cooked meats. After dinner he tried to talk business with Eva\u0027s husband, or Stell\u0027s. His business talks were the old-fashioned kind, beginning: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, now, looka here. Take, f\u0027rinstance, your raw hides and leathers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Ben and George didn\u0027t want to take, f\u0027rinstance, your raw hides and leathers. They wanted, when they took anything at all, to take golf, or politics, or stocks. They were the modern type of businessman who prefers to leave his work out of his play. Business, with them, was a profession—a finely graded and balanced thing, differing from Jo\u0027s clumsy, down-hill style as completely as does the method of a great criminal detective differ from that of a village constable. They would listen, restively, and say, \"Uh-uh,\" at intervals, and at the first chance they would sort of fade out of the room, with a meaning glance at their wives. Eva had two children now. Girls. They treated Uncle Jo with good-natured tolerance. Stell had no children. Uncle Jo degenerated, by almost imperceptible degrees, from the position of honored guest, who is served with white meat, to that of one who is content with a leg and one of those obscure and bony sections which, after much turning with a bewildered and investigating knife and fork, leave one baffled and unsatisfied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eva and Stell got together and decided that Jo ought to marry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t natural,\" Eva told him. \"I never saw a man who took so little interest in women.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me!\" protested Jo, almost shyly. \"Women!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. Of course. You act like a frightened schoolboy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So they had in for dinner certain friends and acquaintances of fitting age. They spoke of them as \"splendid girls.\" Between thirty-six and forty. They talked awfully well, in a firm, clear way, about civics, and classes, and politics, and economics, and boards. They rather terrified Jo. He didn\u0027t understand much that they talked about, and he felt humbly inferior, and yet a little resentful, as if something had passed him by. He escorted them home, dutifully, though they told him not to bother, and they evidently meant it. They seemed capable not only of going home quite unattended but of delivering a pointed lecture to any highwayman or brawler who might molest them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The following Thursday Eva would say, \"How did you like her, Jo?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Like who?\" Joe would spar feebly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Matthews.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s she?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, don\u0027t be funny, Jo. You know very well I mean the girl who was here for dinner. The one who talked so well on the emigration question.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, her! Why, I liked her all right. Seems to be a smart woman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Smart! She\u0027s a perfectly splendid girl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure,\" Jo would agree cheerfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But didn\u0027t you like her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say I did, Eve. And I can\u0027t say I didn\u0027t. She made me think a lot of a teacher I had in the fifth reader. Name of Himes. As I recall her, she must have been a fine woman. But I never thought of Himes as a woman at all. She was just Teacher.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You make me tired,\" snapped Eva impatiently. \"A man of your age. You don\u0027t expect to marry a girl, do you? A child!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t expect to marry anybody,\" Jo had answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n And that was the truth, lonely though he often was. \\n\\n \\n\\n The following spring Eva moved to Winnetka. Anyone who got the meaning of the Loop knows the significance of a move to a North Shore suburb, and a house. Eva\u0027s daughter, Ethel, was growing up, and her mother had an eye on society. \\n\\n \\n\\n That did away with Jo\u0027s Thursday dinners. Then Stell\u0027s husband bought a car. They went out into the country every Sunday. Stell said it was getting so that maids objected to Sunday dinners, anyway. Besides, they were unhealthful, old-fashioned things. They always meant to ask Jo to come along, but by the time their friends were placed, and the lunch, and the boxes, and sweaters, and George\u0027s camera, and everything, there seemed to be no room for a man of Jo\u0027s bulk. So that eliminated the Sunday dinners. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just drop in any time during the week,\" Stell said, \"for dinner. Except Wednesday—that\u0027s our bridge night—and Saturday. And, of course, Thursday. Cook is out that night. Don\u0027t wait for me to phone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so Jo drifted into that sad-eyed, dyspeptic family made up of those you see dining in second-rate restaurants, their paper propped up against the bowl of oyster crackers, munching solemnly and with indifference to the stare of the passer-by surveying them through the brazen plate-glass window. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then came the war. The war that spelled death and destruction to millions. The war that brought a fortune to Jo Hertz, and transformed him, overnight, from a baggy-kneed old bachelor whose business was a failure to a prosperous manufacturer whose only trouble was the shortage in hides for the making of his product. Leather! The armies of Europe called for it. Harnesses! More harnesses! Straps! Millions of straps. More! More! \\n\\n \\n\\n The musty old harness business over on Lake Street was magically changed from a dust-covered, dead-alive concern to an orderly hive that hummed and glittered with success. Orders poured in. Jo Hertz had inside information on the war. He knew about troops and horses. He talked with French and English and Italian buyers commissioned by their countries to get American-made supplies. And now, when he said to Ben or George, \"Take, f\u0027rinstance, your raw hides and leathers,\" they listened with respectful attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then began the gay-dog business in the life of Jo Hertz. He developed into a Loop-hound, ever keen on the scent of fresh pleasure. That side of Jo Hertz which had been repressed and crushed and ignored began to bloom, unhealthily. At first he spent money on his rather contemptuous nieces. He sent them gorgeous furs, and watch bracelets, and bags. He took two expensive rooms at a downtown hotel, and there was something more tear-compelling than grotesque about the way he gloated over the luxury of a separate ice-water tap in the bathroom. He explained it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just turn it on. Any hour of the day or night. Ice water!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He bought a car. Naturally. A glittering affair; in color a bright blue, with pale-blue leather straps and a great deal of gold fittings, and special tires. Eva said it was the kind of thing a chorus girl would use, rather than an elderly businessman. You saw him driving about in it, red-faced and rather awkward at the wheel. You saw him, too, in the Pompeian Room at the Congress Hotel of a Saturday afternoon when roving-eyed matrons in mink coats are wont to congregate to sip pale-amber drinks. Actors grew to recognize the semibald head and the shining, round, good-natured face looming out at them from the dim well of the theater, and sometimes, in a musical show, they directed a quip at him, and he liked it. He could pick out the critics as they came down the aisle, and even had a nodding acquaintance with two of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kelly, of the Herald,\" he would say carelessly. \"Bean, of the Trib. They\u0027re all afraid of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So he frolicked, ponderously. In New York he might have been called a Man About Town. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he was lonesome. He was very lonesome. So he searched about in his mind and brought from the dim past the memory of the luxuriously furnished establishment of which he used to dream in the evenings when he dozed over his paper in the old house on Calumet. So he rented an apartment, many-roomed and expensive, with a manservant in charge, and furnished it in styles and periods ranging through all the Louis. The living room was mostly rose color. It was like an unhealthy and bloated boudoir. And yet there was nothing sybaritic or uncleanly in the sight of this paunchy, middle-aged man sinking into the rosy-cushioned luxury of his ridiculous home. It was a frank and naive indulgence of long-starved senses, and there was in it a great resemblance to the rolling-eyed ecstasy of a schoolboy smacking his lips over an all-day sucker. \\n\\n \\n\\n The war went on, and on, and on. And the money continued to roll in—a flood of it. Then, one afternoon, Eva, in town on shopping bent, entered a small, exclusive, and expensive shop on Michigan Avenue. Eva\u0027s weakness was hats. She was seeking a hat now. She described what she sought with a languid conciseness, and stood looking about her after the saleswoman had vanished in quest of it. The room was becomingly rose-illumined and somewhat dim, so that some minutes had passed before she realized that a man seated on a raspberry brocade settee not five feet away—a man with a walking stick, and yellow gloves, and tan spats, and a check suit—was her brother Jo. From him Eva\u0027s wild-eyed glance leaped to the woman who was trying on hats before one of the many long mirrors. She was seated, and a saleswoman was exclaiming discreetly at her elbow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eva turned sharply and encountered her own saleswoman returning hat-laden. \"Not today,\" she gasped. \"I\u0027m feeling ill. Suddenly.\" And almost ran from the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n That evening she told Stell, relating her news in that telephone pidgin English devised by every family of married sisters as protection against the neighbors. Translated, it ran thus: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He looked straight at me. My dear, I thought I\u0027d die! But at least he had sense enough not to speak. She was one of those limp, willowy creatures with the greediest eyes that she tried to keep softened to a baby stare, and couldn\u0027t, she was so crazy to get her hands on those hats. I saw it all in one awful minute. You know the way I do. I suppose some people would call her pretty. I don\u0027t. And her color. Well! And the most expensive-looking hats. Not one of them under seventy-five. Isn\u0027t it disgusting! At his age! Suppose Ethel had been with me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The next time it was Stell who saw them. In a restaurant. She said it spoiled her evening. And the third time it was Ethel. She was one of the guests at a theater party given by Nicky Overton II. The North Shore Overtons. Lake Forest. They came in late, and occupied the entire third row at the opening performance of Believe Me! And Ethel was Nicky\u0027s partner. She was glowing like a rose. When the lights went up after the first act Ethel saw that her uncle Jo was seated just ahead of her with what she afterward described as a blonde. Then her uncle had turned around, and seeing her, had been surprised into a smile that spread genially all over his plump and rubicund face. Then he had turned to face forward again, quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s the old bird?\" Nicky had asked. Ethel had pretended not to hear, so he had asked again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My uncle,\" Ethel answered, and flushed all over her delicate face, and down to her throat. Nicky had looked at the blonde, and his eyebrows had gone up ever so slightly. \\n\\n \\n\\n It spoiled Ethel\u0027s evening. More than that, as she told her mother of it later, weeping, she declared it had spoiled her life. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eva talked it over with her husband in that intimate hour that precedes bedtime. She gesticulated heatedly with her hairbrush. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s disgusting, that\u0027s what it is. Perfectly disgusting. There\u0027s no fool like an old fool. Imagine! A creature like that. At his time of life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" Ben said, and even grinned a little. \"I suppose a boy\u0027s got to sow his wild oats sometime.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be any more vulgar than you can help,\" Eva retorted. \"And I think you know, as well as I, what it means to have that Overton boy interested in Ethel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he\u0027s interested in her,\" Ben blundered, \"I guess the fact that Ethel\u0027s uncle went to the theater with someone who isn\u0027t Ethel\u0027s aunt won\u0027t cause a shudder to run up and down his frail young frame, will it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" Eva had retorted. \"If you\u0027re not man enough to stop it, I\u0027ll have to, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m going up there with Stell this week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They did not notify Jo of their coming. Eva telephoned his apartment when she knew he would be out, and asked his man if he expected his master home to dinner that evening. The man had said yes. Eva arranged to meet Stell in town. They would drive to Jo\u0027s apartment together, and wait for him there. \\n\\n \\n\\n When she reached the city Eva found turmoil there. The first of the American troops to be sent to France were leaving. Michigan Boulevard was a billowing, surging mass: flags, pennants, banners, crowds. All the elements that make for demonstration. And over the whole-quiet. No holiday crowd, this. A solid, determined mass of people waiting patient hours to see the khaki-clads go by. Three years had brought them to a clear knowledge of what these boys were going to. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it dreadful!\" Stell gasped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nicky Overton\u0027s too young, thank goodness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Their car was caught in the jam. When they moved at all, it was by inches. When at last they reached Jo\u0027s apartment they were flushed, nervous, apprehensive. But he had not yet come in. So they waited. \\n\\n \\n\\n No, they were not staying to dinner with their brother, they told the relieved houseman. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stell and Eva, sunk in rose-colored cushions, viewed the place with disgust and some mirth. They rather avoided each other\u0027s eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Carrie ought to be here,\" Eva said. They both smiled at the thought of the austere Carrie in the midst of those rosy cushions, and hangings, and lamps. Stell rose and began to walk about restlessly. She picked up a vase and laid it down; straightened a picture. Eva got up, too, and wandered into the hall. She stood there a moment, listening. Then she turned and passed into Jo\u0027s bedroom, Stell following. And there you knew Jo for what he was. \\n\\n \\n\\n This room was as bare as the other had been ornate. It was Jo, the clean-minded and simplehearted, in revolt against the cloying luxury with which he had surrounded himself. The bedroom, of all rooms in any house, reflects the personality of its occupant. True, the actual furniture was paneled, cupid-surmounted, and ridiculous. It had been the fruit of Jo\u0027s first orgy of the senses. But now it stood out in that stark little room with an air as incongruous and ashamed as that of a pink tarlatan danseuse who finds herself in a monk\u0027s cell. None of those wall pictures with which bachelor bedrooms are reputed to be hung. No satin slippers. No scented notes. Two plain-backed military brushes on the chiffonier (and he so nearly hairless!). A little orderly stack of books on the table near the bed. Eva fingered their titles and gave a little gasp. One of them was on gardening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, of all things!\" exclaimed Stell. A book on the war, by an Englishman. A detective story of the lurid type that lulls us to sleep. His shoes ranged in a careful row in the closet, with a shoe tree in every one of them. There was something speaking about them. They looked so human. Eva shut the door on them quickly. Some bottles on the dresser. A jar of pomade. An ointment such as a man uses who is growing bald and is panic-stricken too late. An insurance calendar on the wall. Some rhubarb-and-soda mixture on the shelf in the bathroom, and a little box of pepsin tablets. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eats all kinds of things at all hours of the night,\" Eva said, and wandered out into the rose-colored front room again with the air of one who is chagrined at her failure to find what she has sought. Stell followed her furtively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where do you suppose he can be?\" she demanded. \"It\u0027s\"—she glanced at her wrist—\"why, it\u0027s after six!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then there was a little click. The two women sat up, tense. The door opened. Jo came in. He blinked a little. The two women in the rosy room stood up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why—Eve! Why, Babe! Well! Why didn\u0027t you let me know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We were just about to leave. We thought you weren\u0027t coming home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo came in slowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was in the jam on Michigan, watching the boys go by.\" He sat down, heavily. The light from the window fell on him. And you saw that his eyes were red. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had found himself one of the thousands in the jam on Michigan Avenue, as he said. He had a place near the curb, where his big frame shut off the view of the unfortunates behind him. He waited with the placid interest of one who has subscribed to all the funds and societies to which a prosperous, middle-aged businessman is called upon to subscribe in war-time. Then, just as he was about to leave, impatient at the delay, the crowd had cried, with a queer, dramatic, exultant note in its voice, \"Here they come! Here come the boys!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Just at that moment two little, futile, frenzied fists began to beat a mad tattoo on Jo Hertz\u0027s broad back. Jo tried to turn in the crowd, all indignant resentment. \"Say, looka here!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little fists kept up their frantic beating and pushing. And a voice—a choked, high little voice—cried, \"Let me by! I can\u0027t see! You MAN, you! You big fat man! My boy\u0027s going by—to war—and I can\u0027t see! Let me by!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo scrooged around, still keeping his place. He looked down. And upturned to him in agonized appeal was the face of Emily. They stared at each other for what seemed a long, long time. It was really only the fraction of a second. Then Jo put one great arm firmly around Emily\u0027s waist and swung her around in front of him. His great bulk protected her. Emily was clinging to his hand. She was breathing rapidly, as if she had been running. Her eyes were straining up the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Emily, how in the world——!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ran away. Fred didn\u0027t want me to come. He said it would excite me too much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fred?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My husband. He made me promise to say good-by to Jo at home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jo?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jo\u0027s my boy. And he\u0027s going to war. So I ran away. I had to see him. I had to see him go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was dry-eyed. Her gaze was straining up the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, sure,\" said Jo. \"Of course you want to see him.\" And then the crowd gave a great roar. There came over Jo a feeling of weakness. He was trembling. The boys went marching by. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There he is,\" Emily shrilled, above the din. \"There he is! There he is! There he——\" And waved a futile little hand. It wasn\u0027t so much a wave as a clutching. A clutching after something beyond her reach. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Which one? Which one, Emily?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The handsome one. The handsome one.\" Her voice quavered and died. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo put a steady hand on her shoulder. \"Point him out,\" he commanded \"Show me.\" And the next instant, \"Never mind. I see him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Somehow, miraculously, he had picked him from among the hundreds. Had picked him as surely as his own father might have. It was Emily\u0027s boy. He was marching by, rather stiffly. He was nineteen, and fun-loving, and he had a girl, and he didn\u0027t particularly want to go to France and—to go to France. But more than he had hated going, he had hated not to go. So he marched by, looking straight ahead, his jaw set so that his chin stuck out just a little. Emily\u0027s boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo looked at him, and his face flushed purple. His eyes, the hard-boiled eyes of a Loop-hound, took on the look of a sad old man. And suddenly he was no longer Jo, the sport; old J. Hertz, the gay dog. He was Jo Hertz, thirty, in love with life, in love with Emily, and with the stinging blood of young manhood coursing through his veins. \\n\\n \\n\\n Another minute and the boy had passed on up the broad street—the fine, flag-bedecked street—just one of a hundred service hats bobbing in rhythmic motion like sandy waves lapping a shore and flowing on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he disappeared altogether. \\n\\n \\n\\n Emily was clinging to Jo. She was mumbling something, over and over. \"I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t. Don\u0027t ask me to. I can\u0027t let him go. Like that. I can\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo said a queer thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Emily! We wouldn\u0027t have him stay home, would we? We wouldn\u0027t want him to do anything different, would we? Not our boy. I\u0027m glad he enlisted. I\u0027m proud of him. So are you glad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Little by little he quieted her. He took her to the car that was waiting, a worried chauffeur in charge. They said good-by, awkwardly. Emily\u0027s face was a red, swollen mass. \\n\\n \\n\\n So it was that when Jo entered his own hallway half an hour later he blinked, dazedly, and when the light from the window fell on him you saw that his eyes were red. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eva was not one to beat about the bush. She sat forward in her chair, clutching her bag rather nervously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, look here, Jo. Stell and I are here for a reason. We\u0027re here to tell you that this thing\u0027s going to stop.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thing? Stop?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know very well what I mean. You saw me at the milliner\u0027s that day. And night before last, Ethel. We\u0027re all disgusted. If you must go about with people like that, please have some sense of decency.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Something gathering in Jo\u0027s face should have warned her. But he was slumped down in his chair in such a huddle, and he looked so old and fat that she did not heed it. She went on. \"You\u0027ve got us to consider. Your sisters. And your nieces. Not to speak of your own——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But he got to his feet then, shaking, and at what she saw in his face even Eva faltered and stopped. It wasn\u0027t at all the face of a fat, middle-aged sport. It was a face Jovian, terrible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You!\" he began, low-voiced, ominous. \"You!\" He raised a great fist high. \"You two murderers! You didn\u0027t consider me, twenty years ago. You come to me with talk like that. Where\u0027s my boy! You killed him, you two, twenty years ago. And now he belongs to somebody else. Where\u0027s my son that should have gone marching by today?\" He flung his arms out in a great gesture of longing. The red veins stood out on his forehead. \"Where\u0027s my son! Answer me that, you two selfish, miserable women. Where\u0027s my son!\" Then, as they huddled together, frightened, wild-eyed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Out of my house! Out of my house! Before I hurt you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They fled, terrified. The door banged behind them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo stood, shaking, in the center of the room. Then he reached for a chair, gropingly, and sat down. He passed one moist, flabby hand over his forehead and it came away wet. The telephone rang. He sat still. It sounded far away and unimportant, like something forgotten. But it rang and rang insistently. Jo liked to answer his telephone when he was at home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello!\" He knew instantly the voice at the other end. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That you, Jo?\" it said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s my boy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m—all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen, Jo. The crowd\u0027s coming over tonight. I\u0027ve fixed up a little poker game for you. Just eight of us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t come tonight, Gert.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t! Why not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not feeling so good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You just said you were all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I AM all right. Just kind of tired.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The voice took on a cooing note. \"Is my Joey tired? Then he shall be all comfy on the sofa, and he doesn\u0027t need to play if he don\u0027t want to. No, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jo stood staring at the black mouthpiece of the telephone. He was seeing a procession go marching by. Boys, hundreds of boys, in khaki. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello! Hello!\" The voice took on an anxious note. \"Are you there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" wearily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jo, there\u0027s something the matter. You\u0027re sick. I\u0027m coming right over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!\" \"Why not? You sound as if you\u0027d been sleeping. Look here——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Leave me alone!\" cried Jo, suddenly, and the receiver clacked onto the hook. \"Leave me alone. Leave me alone.\" Long after the connection had been broken. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood staring at the instrument with unseeing eyes. Then he turned and walked into the front room. All the light had gone out of it. Dusk had come on. All the light had gone out of everything. The zest had gone out of life. The game was over—the game he had been playing against loneliness and disappointment. And he was just a tired old man. A lonely, tired old man in a ridiculous rose-colored room that had grown, all of a sudden, drab {sic} \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2692/74057.html","bookId":1476,"book":{"id":1476,"title":"One Basket","description":"简介： Before she tried to be a good woman she had been a very bad womanso bad that she could trail her wonderful apparel up and down Main Street, from the Elm Tree Bakery to the railroad tracks, without once having a man doff his hat to her or a woman bow....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2692","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:13 AM"}}
