Then, in the midst of renovations, she makes a grim discovery. Hidden within the walls of Sarah\u0027s dream house are the remains of dozens of bodies -- some dating back over a century. \\n The door to the past is blown wide open when Caleb Anderson, a private investigator, shows up at the mansion. He believes several current missing-persons cases are linked to the house and its dark past. Working together to find the connection and stop a contemporary killer, Sarah and Caleb are compelled to research the history of the haunted house, growing closer to each other even as the solution to the murders eludes them. \\n But there is one who knows the truth -- a spirit who follows every move they make. Soon Caleb begins to fear that if he can\u0027t stay a step ahead, he could lose Sarah to a killer with an ability to transcend time in a quest for blood and sacrifice.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/unhallowed-ground-harrison-investigation-7.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
