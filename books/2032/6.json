{"id":108714,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Stefan sat in the Gilbert living room, agreeing politely with whatever it was Aunt Judith was saying. The older woman was uncomfortable having him here; you didn\u0027t need to be a mind reader to know that. But she was trying, and so Stefan was trying, too. He wanted Elena to be happy.\n Elena. Even when he wasn\u0027t looking at her, he was aware of her more than of anything else in the room. Her living presence beat against his skin like sunlight against closed eyelids. When he actually let himself turn to face her, it was a sweet shock to all his senses.\n He loved her so much. He never saw her as Katherine any more; he had almost forgotten how much she looked like the dead girl. In any case, there were so many differences. Elena had the same pale gold hair and creamy skin, the same delicate features as Katherine, but there the resemblance ended. Her eyes, looking violet in the firelight just now but normally a blue as dark as lapis lazuli, were neither timid nor childlike as Katherine\u0027s had been. On the contrary, they were windows to her soul, which shone like an eager flame behind them. Elena was Elena, and her image had replaced Katherine\u0027s gentle ghost in his heart.\n But her very strength made their love dangerous. He hadn\u0027t been able to resist her last week when she\u0027d offered him her blood. Granted, he might have died without it, but it had been far too soon for Elena\u0027s own safety. For the hundredth time, his eyes moved over Elena\u0027s face, searching for the telltale signs of change. Was that creamy skin a little paler? Was her expression slightly more remote?\n They would have to be careful from now on. He would have to be more careful. Make sure to feed often, satisfy himself with animals, so he wouldn\u0027t be tempted. Never let the need get too strong. Now that he thought of it, he was hungry right now. The dry ache, the burning, was spreading along his upper jaw, whispering through his veins and capillaries. He should be out in the woods - senses alert to catch the slightest crackle of dry twigs, muscles ready for the chase - not here by a fire watching the tracery of pale blue veins in Elena\u0027s throat.\n That slim throat turned as Elena looked at him.\n \"Do you want to go to that party tonight? We can take Aunt Judith\u0027s car,\" she said.\n \"But you ought to stay for dinner first,\" said Aunt Judith quickly.\n \"We can pick up something on the way.\" Elena meant they could pick up something for her, Stefan thought. He himself could chew and swallow ordinary food if he had to, though it did him no good, and he had long since lost any taste for it. No, his... appetites... were more particular now, he thought. And if they went to this party, it would mean hours more before he could feed. But he nodded agreement to Elena.\n \"If you want to,\" he said.\n She did want to; she was set on it. He\u0027d seen that from the beginning. \"All right then, I\u0027d better change.\"\n She glanced through the doorway, to the empty living room, and said, \"It\u0027s all right. They\u0027re almost healed already. See?\" She tugged her lacy collar down, twisting her head to one side.\n Stefan stared, mesmerized, at the two round marks on the fine-grained skin. They were a very light, translucent burgundy color, like much-watered wine. He set his teeth and forced his eyes away. Looking much longer at that would drive him crazy.\n \"That wasn\u0027t what I meant,\" he said brusquely.\n The shining veil of her hair fell over the marks again, hiding them. \"Oh.\"\n \"Come in!\"\n As they did, walking into the room, conversations stopped. Elena looked at the faces turned toward them, at the curious, furtive eyes and the wary expressions. Not the kind of looks she was used to getting when she made an entrance.\n It was another student who\u0027d opened the door for them; Alaric Saltzman was nowhere in sight. But Caroline was, seated on a bar stool, which showed off her legs to their best advantage. She gave Elena a mocking look and then made some remark to a boy on her right. He laughed.\n Elena could feel her smile start to go painful, while a flush crept up toward her face. Then a familiar voice came to her.\n \"Elena, Stefan! Over here.\"\n Gratefully, she spotted Bonnie sitting with Meredith and Ed Goff on a loveseat in the corner. She and Stefan settled on a large ottoman opposite them, and she heard conversations start to pick up again around the room.\n By tacit agreement, no one mentioned the awkwardness of Elena and Stefan\u0027s arrival. Elena was determined to pretend that everything was as usual.\n And Bonnie and Meredith were backing her. \"You look great,\" said Bonnie warmly. \"I just love that red sweater.\"\n \"She does look nice. Doesn\u0027t she, Ed?\" said Meredith, and Ed, looking vaguely startled, agreed.\n \"So your class was invited to this, too,\" Elena said to Meredith. \"I thought maybe it was just seventh period.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know ifinvited is the word.\" replied Meredith dryly. \"Considering that participation is half our grade.\"\n \"Do you think he was serious about that? He couldn\u0027t be serious,\" put in Ed.\n \"Ray? Oh, Ray. I don\u0027t know, around somewhere, I suppose. There\u0027s a lot of people here.\"\n That was true. The Ramsey living room was packed, and from what Elena could see the crowd flowed into the dining room, the front parlor, and probably the kitchen as well. Elbows kept brushing Elena\u0027s hair as people circulated behind her.\n \"What did Saltzman want with you after class?\" Stefan was saying.\n \"Alaric,\" Bonnie corrected primly. \"He wants us to call him Alaric. Oh, he was just being nice. He felt awful for making me relive such an agonizing experience. He didn\u0027t know exactly how Mr. Tanner died, and he hadn\u0027t realized I was so sensitive. Of course, he\u0027s incredibly sensitive himself, so he understands what it\u0027s like. He\u0027s an Aquarius.\"\n \"With a moon rising in pickup lines,\" said Meredith under her breath. \"Bonnie you don\u0027t believe that garbage, do you? He\u0027s a teacher; he shouldn\u0027t be trying that out on students.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t trying anything out! He said exactly the same thing to Tyler and Sue Carson. He said we should form a support group for each other or write an essay about that night to get our feelings out. He said teenagers are all very impressionable and he didn\u0027t want the tragedy to have a lasting impact on our lives.\"\n \"Oh, brother,\" said Ed, and Stefan turned a laugh into a cough. He wasn\u0027t amused, though, and his question to Bonnie hadn\u0027t been just idle curiosity. Elena could tell; she could feel it radiating from him. Stefan felt about Alaric Saltzman the way that most of the people in this room felt about Stefan. Wary and mistrustful.\n \"Itwas strange, him acting as if the party was a spontaneous idea in our class,\" she said, responding unconsciously to Stefan\u0027s unspoken words, \"when obviously it had been planned.\"\n \"What\u0027s even stranger is the idea that the school would hire a teacher without telling him how the previous teacher died,\" said Stefan. \"Everyone was talking about it; it must have been in the papers.\"\n \"But not all the details,\" said Bonnie firmly. \"In fact, there are things the police still haven\u0027t let out, because they think it might help them catch the killer. For instance,\" she dropped her voice, \"do you know what Mary said? Dr. Feinberg was talking to the guy who did the autopsy, the medical examiner. And he said that there was no blood left in the body at all. Not a drop.\"\n Elena felt an icy wind blow through her, as if she stood once again in the graveyard. She couldn\u0027t speak. But Ed said, \"Where\u0027d it go?\"\n \"Well, all over the floor, I suppose,\" said Bonnie calmly. \"All over the altar and everything. That\u0027s what the police are investigating now. But it\u0027s unusual for a corpse not to haveany blood left; usually there\u0027s some that settles down on the underside of the body. Postmortem lividity, it\u0027s called. It looks like big purple bruises. What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"Your incredible sensitivity has me ready to throw up,\" said Meredith in a strangled voice. \"Could we possibly talk about something else?\"\n \"You weren\u0027t the one with blood all over you,\" Bonnie began, but Stefan interrupted her.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Bonnie, and then she brightened. \"That\u0027s right, Elena, you said you knew - \"\n \"Shut up, Bonnie,\" said Elena desperately. If there ever were a placenot to discuss this, it was in a crowded room surrounded by people who hated Stefan. Bonnie\u0027s eyes widened, and then she nodded, subsiding.\n Elena could not relax, though. Stefan hadn\u0027t killed Mr. Tanner, and yet the same evidence that would lead to Damon could as easily lead to him. Andwould lead to him, because no one but she and Stefan knew of Damon\u0027s existence. He was out there, somewhere, in the shadows. Waiting for his next victim. Maybe waiting for Stefan - or for her.\n \"I\u0027m hot,\" she said abruptly. \"I think I\u0027ll go see what kinds of refreshmentsAlaric has provided.\"\n Stefan started to rise, but Elena waved him back down. He wouldn\u0027t have any use for potato chips and punch. And she wanted to be alone for a few minutes, to be moving instead of sitting, to calm herself.\n Being with Meredith and Bonnie had given her a false sense of security. Leaving them, she was once again confronted by sidelong glances and suddenly turned backs. This time it made her angry. She moved through the crowd with deliberate insolence, holding any eye she accidentally caught. I\u0027m already notorious, she thought. I might as well be brazen, too.\n She was hungry. In the Ramsey dining room someone had set up an assortment of finger foods that looked surprisingly good. Elena took a paper plate and dropped a few carrot sticks on it, ignoring the people around the bleached oak table. She wasn\u0027t going to speak to them unless they spoke first. She gave her full attention to the refreshments, leaning past people to select cheese wedges and Ritz crackers, reaching in front of them to pluck grapes, ostentatiously looking up and down the whole array to see if there was anything she\u0027d missed.\n She\u0027d succeeded in riveting everyone\u0027s attention, something she knew without raising her eyes. She bit delicately down on a bread stick, holding it between her teeth like a pencil, and turned from the table.\n \"Mind if I have a bite?\"\n Shock snapped her eyes wide open and froze her breath. Her mind jammed, refusing to acknowledge what was going on, and leaving her helpless, vulnerable, in the face of it. But though rational thought had disappeared, her senses went right on recording mercilessly: dark eyes dominating her field of vision, a whiff of some kind of cologne in her nostrils, two long fingers tilting her chin up. Damon leaned in, and, neatly and precisely, bit off the other end of the bread stick.\n In that moment, their lips were only inches apart. He was leaning in for a second bite before Elena\u0027s wits revived enough to throw her backward, her hand grabbing the bit of crisp bread and tossing it away. He caught it in midair, a virtuoso display of reflex.\n His eyes were still on hers. Elena got in a breath at last and opened her mouth; she wasn\u0027t sure what for. To scream, probably. To warn all these people to run out into the night. Her heart was pounding like a triphammer, her vision blurred.\n What are you doing here? she thought. The scene around her seemed eerily bright and unnatural. It was like one of those nightmares when everything is ordinary, just like waking life, and then suddenly something grotesque happens. He was going to kill them all.\n \"Elena? Are you okay?\" Sue Carson was talking to her, gripping her shoulder.\n \"I think she choked on something,\" Damon said, releasing Elena\u0027s wrist. \"But she\u0027s all right now. Why don\u0027t you introduce us?\"\n He was going to kill them all...\n \"Elena, this is Damon, um...\" Sue spread an apologetic hand, and Damon finished for her.\n \"Smith.\" He lifted a paper cup toward Elena. \"La vita.\"\n \"What are you doing here?\" she whispered.\n \"He\u0027s a college student,\" Sue volunteered, when it became apparent that Damon wasn\u0027t going to answer.\n \"From - University of Virginia, was it? William and Mary?\"\n \"Among other places,\" Damon said, still looking at Elena. He hadn\u0027t glanced at Sue once. \"I like to travel.\"\n The world had snapped into place again around Elena, but it was a chilling world. There were people on every side, watching this exchange with fascination, keeping her from speaking freely. But they were also\n keeping her safe. For whatever reason, Damon was playing a game, pretending to be one of them. And while the masquerade went on, he wouldn\u0027t do anything to her in front of a crowd... she hoped.\n A game. But he was making up the rules. He was standing here in the Ramseys\u0027 dining room playing with her.\n \"He\u0027s just down for a few days,\" Sue was continuing helpfully. \"Visiting - friends, did you say? Or relatives?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Damon.\n \"You\u0027re lucky to be able to take off whenever you want,\" Elena said. She didn\u0027t know what was possessing her, to make her try and unmask him.\n \"Luck has very little to do with it,\" said Damon. \"Do you like dancing?\"\n \"What\u0027s your major?\"\n He smiled at her. \"American folklore. Did you know, for instance, that a mole on the neck means you\u0027ll be wealthy? Do you mind if I check?\"\n \"I mind.\" The voice came from behind Elena. It was clear and cold and quiet. Elena had heard Stefan \"But do you matter?\" he said.\n The two of them faced each other under the faintly flickering yellow light of the brass chandelier.\n Elena was aware of layers of her own thoughts, like a parfait. Everyone\u0027s staring; this must be better than the movies... I didn\u0027t realize Stefan was taller... There\u0027s Bonnie and Meredith wondering what\u0027s going on... Stefan\u0027s angry but he\u0027s still weak, still hurting... If he goes for Damon now, he\u0027ll lose...\n And in front of all these people. Her thoughts came to a clattering halt as everything fell into place. That was what Damon was here for, to make Stefan attack him, apparently unprovoked. No matter what happened after that, he won. If Stefan drove him away, it would just be more proof of Stefan\u0027s \"tendency toward violence.\" More evidence for Stefan\u0027s accusers. And if Stefan lost the fight...\n It would mean his life, thought Elena. Oh, Stefan, he\u0027s so much stronger right now; please don\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t play into his hands.\n Hewants to kill you; he\u0027s just looking for a chance.\n She made her limbs move, though they were stiff and awkward as a marionette\u0027s. \"Stefan,\" she said, taking his cold hand in hers, \"let\u0027s go home.\"\n She could feel the tension in his body, like an electric current running underneath his skin. At this moment, he was completely focused on Damon, and the light in his eyes was like fire reflecting off a dagger blade. She didn\u0027t recognize him in this mood, didn\u0027t know him. He frightened her.\n \"Stefan,\" she said, calling to him as if she were lost in fog and couldn\u0027t find him. \"Stefan,please. \"\n And slowly, slowly, she felt him respond. She heard him breathe and felt his body go off alert, clicking down to some lower energy level. The deadly concentration of his mind was diverted and he looked at her, and saw her.\n \"All right,\" he said softly, looking into her eyes. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n She kept her hands on him as they turned away, one clasping his hand, the other tucked inside his arm. By sheer force of will, she managed not to look over her shoulder as they walked away, but the skin on her back tingled and crawled as if expecting the stab of a knife.\n Instead, she heard Damon\u0027s low ironical voice: \"And have you heard that kissing a red-haired girl cures fever blisters?\" And then Bonnie\u0027s outrageous, flattered laughter.\n On the way out, they finally ran into their host.\n \"Leaving so soon?\" Alaric said. \"But I haven\u0027t even had a chance to talk to you yet.\"\n He looked both eager and reproachful, like a dog that knows perfectly well it\u0027s not going to be taken on a walk but wags anyway. Elena felt worry blossom in her stomach for him and everyone else in the house. She and Stefan were leaving them to Damon.\n Right now she had enough to do getting Stefan out of here before he changed his mind.\n \"I\u0027m not feeling very well,\" she said as she picked up her purse where it lay by the ottoman. \"Sorry.\" She increased the pressure on Stefan\u0027s arm. It would take very little to get him to turn back and head for the dining room right now.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Alaric. \"Good-bye.\"\n They were on the threshold before she saw the little slip of violet paper stuck into the side pocket of her purse. She pulled it out and unfolded it almost by reflex, her mind on other things.\n There was writing on it, plain and bold and unfamiliar. Just three lines. She read them and felt the world rock. This was too much; she couldn\u0027t deal with anything more.\n \"What is it?\" said Stefan.\n \"Nothing.\" She thrust the bit of paper back into the side pocket, pushing it down with her fingers. \"It\u0027s nothing, Stefan. Let\u0027s get outside.\"\n They stepped out into driving needles of rain. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-6.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
