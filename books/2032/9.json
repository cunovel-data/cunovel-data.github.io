{"id":108717,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"I know I\u0027m going to be sorry I asked this,\" Matt said, turning red-rimmed eyes from their contemplation of I-95 to Stefan in the passenger seat beside him. \"But can you tell mewhy we want these extra-special, not-available-locally, semi-tropical weeds for Elena?\"\n Stefan looked into the back seat at the results of their search through hedgerows and rough grass. The plants, with their branching green stems and their small-toothed leaves, did look more like weeds than anything else. The dried remains of blossoms at the ends of the shoots were almost invisible, and no one could pretend the shoots themselves were decorative.\n \"What if I said they could be used to make an all-natural eyewash?\" he offered, after a moment\u0027s thought. \"Or an herbal tea?\"\n \"Why? Were you thinking of saying something like that?\"\n \"Good. Because if you did I\u0027d probably deck you.\"\n Without actually looking at Matt, Stefan smiled. There was something new stirring inside him, something he hadn\u0027t felt for nearly five centuries, except with Elena. Acceptance. Warmth and friendship shared with a fellow being, who did not know the truth about him, but who trusted him anyway. Who was willing to take him on faith. He wasn\u0027t sure he deserved it, but he couldn\u0027t deny what it meant to him. It almost made him feel... human again.\n Elena stared at her image in the mirror. It hadn\u0027t been a dream. Not entirely. The wounds in her neck proved that. And now that she\u0027d seen them, she noticed the feeling of light-headedness, of lethargy.\n It was her own fault. She\u0027d taken so much trouble to warn Bonnie and Meredith not to invite any strangers into their houses. And all the time she\u0027d forgotten that she herself had invited Damon into Bonnie\u0027s house. She\u0027d done it that night she had set up the dumb supper in Bonnie\u0027s dining room and called out into the darkness, \"Come in.\"\n And the invitation was good forever. He could return any time he liked, even now. Especially now, while she was weak and might easily be hypnotized into unlocking a window again.\n Elena stumbled out of the bathroom, past Bonnie, and into the guest bedroom. She grabbed her tote bag and began stuffing things into it.\n \"Elena, you can\u0027t go home!\"\n \"I can\u0027t stay here,\" Elena said. She looked around for her shoes, spotted them by the bed, and started forward. Then she stopped, with a strangled sound. Lying on the dainty crumpled linen of the bed there was a single black feather. It was huge, horribly huge and real and solid, with a thick, waxy-looking shaft. It looked almost obscene resting there on the white percale sheets.\n Nausea swept over Elena, and she turned away. She couldn\u0027t breathe.\n \"Okay, okay,\" Bonnie said. \"If you feel that way about it, I\u0027ll get Dad to take you home.\"\n \"You have to come, too.\" It had just dawned on Elena that Bonnie was no safer in this house than she was. Youand your loved ones , she remembered, and turned to grasp Bonnie\u0027s arm. \"Youhave to, Bonnie. I need you with me.\"\n And at last she got her way. The McCulloughs thought she was hysterical, that she was overreacting, possibly that she was having a nervous breakdown. But finally they gave in. Mr. McCullough drove her and Bonnie to the Gilbert house, where, feeling like burglars, they unlocked the door and crept inside without waking anyone up.\n Even here, Elena couldn\u0027t sleep. She lay beside Bonnie\u0027s softly breathing form, staring toward her bedroom window, watching. Outside, the quince branches squeaked against the glass, but nothing else moved until dawn.\n \"Stefan!\" She had never been so glad to see anyone in her life. She flung herself upon him before he could even shut the car door.\n He swayed backward with the force of her impact, and she could feel his surprise. She wasn\u0027t usually so demonstrative in public.\n \"Hey,\" he said, returning the hug gently. \"Me, too, but don\u0027t crush the flowers.\"\n \"Flowers?\" She pulled back to look at what he was carrying; then, she looked at his face. Then at Matt, who was emerging from the other side of the car. Stefan\u0027s face was pale and drawn; Matt\u0027s was puffy with tiredness, with bloodshot eyes.\n \"You\u0027d better come inside,\" she said at last, bewildered. \"You both look awful.\"\n \"It\u0027s vervain,\" said Stefan, some time later. He and Elena were sitting at the kitchen table. Through the open doorway, Matt could be seen stretched out on the family room sofa, snoring gently. He\u0027d flopped there after eating three bowls of cereal. Aunt Judith, Bonnie, and Margaret were still upstairs asleep, but Stefan kept his voice low just the same. \"You remember what I told you about it?\" he said.\n \"You said it helps keep your mind clear even when someone is using Power to influence it.\" Elena was proud of how steady her voice was.\n \"Right. And that\u0027s one of the things Damon might try. He can use the power of his mind even from a distance, and he can do it whether you\u0027re awake or asleep.\"\n Tears filled Elena\u0027s eyes, and she looked down to hide them, gazing at the long slender stems with the dried remains of tiny lilac flowers at the very tips. \"Asleep?\" she said, afraid that this time her voice was not as steady.\n \"Yes. He could influence you to come out of the house, say, or to let him in. But the vervain should prevent that.\" Stefan sounded tired, but satisfied with himself.\n Oh, Stefan, if you only knew, Elena thought. The gift had come one night too late. In spite of all her efforts, a tear fell, dripping onto the long green leaves.\n \"Elena!\" He sounded startled. \"What is it? Tell me.\"\n He was trying to look into her face, but she bowed her head, pressing it into his shoulder. He put his arms around her, not trying to force her up again. \"Tell me,\" he repeated softly.\n This was the moment. If she was ever going to tell him, it should be now. Her throat felt burned and swollen, and she wanted to let all the words inside pour out.\n But she couldn\u0027t. No matter what, I won\u0027t let them fight over me, she thought.\n \"It\u0027s just that - I was worried about you,\" she managed. \"I didn\u0027t know where you\u0027d gone, or when you were coming back.\"\n \"That\u0027s all.\" Now she would have to swear Bonnie to secrecy about the crow. Why did one lie always lead to another? \"What should we do with the vervain?\" she asked, sitting back.\n \"I\u0027ll show you tonight. Once I\u0027ve extracted the oil from the seeds, you can rub it into your skin or add it to a bath. And you can make the dried leaves into a sachet and carry it with you or put it under your pillow at night.\"\n \"I\u0027d better give them to Bonnie and Meredith, too. They\u0027ll need protection.\"\n He nodded. \"For now - \" He broke off a sprig and placed it in her hand. \" - just take this to school with you. I\u0027m going back to the boarding house to extract the oil.\" He paused a moment and then spoke. \"Elena...\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"If I thought it would do you any good, I\u0027d leave. I wouldn\u0027t expose you to Damon. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027d follow me if I went, not any more. I think he might stay - because of you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t eventhink about leaving,\" she said fiercely, looking up at him. \"Stefan, that\u0027s the one thing I couldn\u0027t stand. Promise you won\u0027t; promise me.\"\n \"I won\u0027t leave you alone with him,\" Stefan said, which was not quite the same thing. But there was no point in pushing him further.\n Instead, she helped him wake up Matt, and saw them both off. Then, with a stem of dried vervain in her hand, she went upstairs to get ready for school.\n Bonnie yawned all the way through breakfast, and she didn\u0027t really wake up until they were outside, walking to school with a brisk breeze in their faces. It was going to be a cold day.\n \"I had a very weird dream last night,\" Bonnie said.\n Elena\u0027s heart jumped. She\u0027d already tucked a sprig of vervain into Bonnie\u0027s backpack, down at the bottom, where Bonnie wouldn\u0027t see it. But if Damon had gotten to Bonnie last night...\n \"What about?\" she said, bracing herself.\n \"About you. I saw you standing under a tree and the wind was blowing. For some reason, I was afraid of you, and I didn\u0027t want to go any closer. You looked... different. Very pale but almost glowing. And then a crow flew down from the tree, and you reached out and grabbed it in midair. You were so fast it was unbelievable. And then you looked over at me, with this expression. You were smiling, but it made me want to run. And then you twisted the crow\u0027s neck, and it was dead.\"\n Elena had listened to this with growing horror. Now she said, \"That\u0027s adisgusting dream.\"\n \"It is, isn\u0027t it?\" said Bonnie composedly. \"I wonder what it means? Crows are birds of ill omen in the legends. They can foretell a death.\"\n \"Yes,\" Bonnie said. \"Except for one thing. I had this dreambefore you woke us all up screaming.\"\n That day at lunchtime there was another piece of violet paper on the office bulletin board. This one, though, read simply:LOOK IN PERSONALS.\n \"What personals?\" said Bonnie.\n Meredith, walking up at that moment with a copy of theWildcat Weekly , the school newspaper, provided the answer. \"Have you seen this?\" she said.\n It was in the personals section, completely anonymous, with neither salutation nor signature. Ican\u0027t bear the thought of losing him. But he\u0027s so very unhappy about something, and if he won\u0027t tell me what it is, if he won\u0027t trust me that much, I don\u0027t see any hope for us.\n Reading it, Elena felt a burst of new energy through her tiredness. Oh, God, she hated whoever was doing this. She imagined shooting them, stabbing them, watching them fall. And then, vividly, she imagined something else. Yanking back a fistful of the thief\u0027s hair and sinking her teeth into an unprotected throat. It was a strange, unsettling vision, but for a moment it almost seemed real.\n She became aware that Bonnie and Meredith were looking at her.\n \"Well?\" she said, feeling slightly uncomfortable.\n \"I could tell you weren\u0027t listening,\" sighed Bonnie. \"I just said it still doesn\u0027t look like Da - like the killer\u0027s work to me. It doesn\u0027t seem like a murderer would be so petty.\"\n \"Much as I hate to agree with her, she\u0027s right,\" Meredith said. \"This smells like someone sneaky. Someone who has a grudge against you personally and who really wants to make you suffer.\"\n Saliva had collected in Elena\u0027s mouth, and she swallowed. \"Also somebody who\u0027s familiar with the school. They had to fill out a form for a personals message in one of the journalism classes,\" she said.\n \"And somebody who knew you kept a diary, assuming they stole it on purpose. Maybe they were in one of your classes that day you took it to school. Remember? When Mr. Tanner almost caught you,\" Bonnie added.\n \"Ms. Halperndid catch me; she even read some of it aloud, a bit about Stefan. That was right after Stefan and I got together. Wait a minute, Bonnie. That night at your house when the diary was stolen, how long were you two out of the living room?\"\n \"Just a few minutes. Yangtze had stopped barking, and I went to the door to let him in, and...\" Bonnie pressed her lips together and shrugged.\n \"So the thief had to be familiar with your house,\" said Meredith swiftly, \"or he or she wouldn\u0027t have been able to get in, get the diary, and get out again before we saw them. All right, then, we\u0027re looking for someone sneaky and cruel, probably in one of your classes, Elena, and most likely familiar with Bonnie\u0027s house. Someone who has a personal grudge and will stoop to anything to get you... Oh, my God.\"\n The three of them stared at one another.\n \"We\u0027re so stupid; we should have seen it right away,\" said Meredith.\n For Elena, it meant the sudden realization that all the anger she\u0027d felt about this before was nothing to the anger she was capable of feeling. A candle flame to the sun.\n \"Caroline,\" she said, and clenched her teeth so hard her jaw hurt.\n Caroline. Elena actually felt she could kill the green-eyed girl right now. And she might have rushed out to try if Bonnie and Meredith hadn\u0027t stopped her.\n \"After school,\" said Meredith firmly, \"when we can take her somewhere private. Just wait that long, Elena.\"\n But as they headed for the cafeteria, Elena noticed an auburn head disappearing down the art and music corridor. And she remembered something Stefan had said earlier this year, about Caroline taking him into the photography room at lunchtime. For privacy, Caroline had told him.\n \"You two go on; I forgot something,\" she said as soon as Bonnie and Meredith both had food on their cafeteria trays. Then she pretended to be deaf as she walked rapidly out and backtracked to the art wing.\n All the rooms were dark, but the photography room\u0027s door was unlocked. Something made Elena turn the knob cautiously, and move quietly once she was inside, rather than marching in to start a confrontation as she\u0027d planned. Was Caroline in here? If so, what was she doing alone in the dark?\n The room appeared at first to be deserted. Then Elena heard the murmur of voices from a small alcove at the back, and she saw that the darkroom door was ajar.\n Silently, stealthily, she made her way until she stood just outside the doorway, and the murmur of sound resolved itself into words.\n \"But how can we be sure she\u0027ll be the one they pick?\" That was Caroline.\n \"My father\u0027s on the school board. They\u0027ll pick her, all right.\" Andthat was Tyler Smallwood. His father was a lawyer, and on every board there was. \"Besides, who else would it be?\" he continued. \" \u0027The Spirit of Fell\u0027s Church\u0027 is supposed to be brainy as well as built.\"\n \"AndI don\u0027t have brains, I suppose?\"\n \"Did I say that? Look, if you want to be the one to parade in a white dress on Founders\u0027 Day, fine. But if you want to see Stefan Salvatore run out of town on the evidence of his own girlfriend\u0027s diary...\"\n \"But why wait so long?\"\n Tyler sounded impatient. \"Because this way it\u0027ll ruin the celebration, too. TheFells\u0027 celebration. Why shouldthey get the credit for founding this town? The Smallwoods were here first.\"\n \"Oh, who cares about who founded the town? All I want is to see Elena humiliated in front of the entire\n \"And Salvatore.\" The pure hatred and malice in Tyler\u0027s voice made Elena\u0027s flesh crawl. \"He\u0027ll be lucky if he doesn\u0027t end up hanging from a tree. You\u0027re sure the evidence is there?\"\n \"How many times do I have to tell you? First, it says she lost the ribbon on September second in the cemetery. Then, it says Stefan picked it up that day and kept it. Wickery Bridge is right beside the cemetery. That means Stefan was near the bridge on September second, the night the old man was attacked there. Everybody already knows he was on hand for the attacks on Vickie and Tanner. What more do you want?\"\n \"It would never stand up in court. Maybe I should get some corroborating evidence. Like ask old Mrs. Flowers what time he got home that night.\"\n \"Oh, whocares ? Most people think he\u0027s guilty already. The diary talks about some big secret he\u0027s hiding from everyone. People will get the idea.\"\n \"You\u0027re keeping it in a safe place?\"\n \"No, Tyler, I\u0027m keeping it out on the coffee table. How stupid do you think I am?\"\n \"Stupid enough to send Elena notes tipping her off.\" There was a crackle, as of newspaper. \"Look at this, this is unbelievable. And it\u0027s got to stop,now. What if she figures out who\u0027s doing it?\"\n \"What\u0027s she going to do about it, call the police?\"\n \"I still want you to lay off. Just wait until Founders\u0027 Day; then you\u0027ll get to watch the Ice Princess melt.\"\n \"And to say ciao to Stefan. Tyler... nobody\u0027s really going to hurt him, are they?\"\n \"Whocares?\" Tyler mocked her earlier tone. \"You leave that to me and my friends, Caroline. You just do your part, okay?\"\n Caroline\u0027s voice dropped to a throaty murmur. \"Convince me.\" After a pause Tyler chuckled.\n There was movement, rustling sounds, a sigh. Elena turned and slipped out of the room as quietly as she had come in.\n She got into the next hallway, and then she leaned against the lockers there, trying to think.\n It was almost too much to absorb at once. Caroline, who had once been her best friend, had betrayed her and wanted to see her humiliated in front of the whole school. Tyler, who\u0027d always seemed more an annoying jerk than a real threat, was planning to get Stefan driven out of town - or killed. And the worst thing was that they were using Elena\u0027s own diary to do it.\n Now she understood the beginning of her dream last night. She\u0027d had a dream like it the day before she had discovered that Stefan was missing. In both, Stefan had looked at her with angry, accusing eyes, and then he had thrown a book at her feet and walked away.\n Not a book. Her diary. Which had in it evidence that could be deadly to Stefan. Three times people in Fell\u0027s Church had been attacked, and three times Stefan had been on the scene. What would that look And there was no way to tell the truth. Supposing she said, \"Stefan isn\u0027t guilty. It\u0027s his brother Damon who hates him and who knows how much Stefan hates even the thought of hurting and killing. And who followed Stefan around and attacked people to make Stefan think maybe Stefan had done it, to drive him mad. And who\u0027s here in townsomewhere - look for him in the cemetery or in the woods. But, oh, by the way, don\u0027t just search for a good-looking guy, because he might be a crow at the moment.\n \"Incidentally, he\u0027s a vampire.\"\n She didn\u0027t even believe it herself. It sounded ludicrous.\n A twinge from the side of her neck reminded her how serious the ludicrous story really was. She felt odd today, almost as if she were sick. It was more than just tension and lack of sleep. She felt slightly dizzy, and at times the ground seemed to be spongy, giving way under her feet and then springing back.\n Flu symptoms, except that she was sure they weren\u0027t due to anyvirus in her bloodstream.\n Damon\u0027s fault, again. Everything was Damon\u0027s fault, except the diary. She had no one to blame for that but herself. If only she hadn\u0027t written about Stefan, if only she hadn\u0027t brought the diary to school. If only she hadn\u0027t left it in Bonnie\u0027s living room. If only, if only.\n Right now all that mattered was that she had to get it back. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-9.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
