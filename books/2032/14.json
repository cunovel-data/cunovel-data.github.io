{"id":108722,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Bonnie shivered as she waited outside the tall Victorian house. The air was frosty this morning, and although it was almost eight o\u0027clock the sun had never really come up. The sky was just one dense massed bank of gray and white clouds, creating an eerie twilight below.\n She had begun to stamp her feet and rub her hands together when the Forbes\u0027 door opened. Bonnie moved back a little behind the shrubbery that was her hiding place and watched the family walk to their car. Mr. Forbes was carrying nothing but a camera. Mrs. Forbes had a purse and a folding seat. Daniel Forbes, Caroline\u0027s younger brother, had another seat. And Caroline...\n Bonnie leaned forward, her breath hissing out in satisfaction. Caroline was dressed in jeans and a heavy sweater, and she was carrying some sort of white drawstring purse. Not big but big enough to hold a small diary.\n \"There she is, Aunt Judith. On the corner.\"\n The car slowed to a halt, and Bonnie slid into the back seat with Elena.\n \"She\u0027s got a white drawstring purse,\" she murmured into Elena\u0027s ear as Aunt Judith pulled out again.\n Tingling excitement swept over Elena, and she squeezed Bonnie\u0027s hand. \"Good,\" she breathed. \"Now we\u0027ll see if she brings it into Mrs. Grimesby\u0027s. If not, you tell Meredith it\u0027s in the car.\"\n Bonnie nodded agreement and squeezed Elena\u0027s hand back.\n They arrived at Mrs. Grimesby\u0027s just in time to see Caroline going inside with a white bag hanging from her arm. Bonnie and Elena exchanged a look. Now it was up to Elena to see where Caroline left it in the house.\n \"I\u0027ll get out here too, Miss Gilbert,\" said Bonnie as Elena jumped out of the car. She would wait outside with Meredith until Elena could tell them where the bag was. The important thing was not to let Caroline suspect anything unusual.\n Mrs. Grimesby, who answered Elena\u0027s knock, was the Fell\u0027s Church librarian. Her house looked almost like a library itself; there were bookcases everywhere and books stacked on the floor. She was also the keeper of Fell\u0027s Church\u0027s historical artifacts, including clothing that had been preserved from the town\u0027s earliest days.\n Just now the house was ringing with young voices, and the bedrooms were full of students in various stages of undress. Mrs. Grimesby always supervised the costumes for the pageant. Elena was ready to ask to be put in the same room with Caroline, but it wasn\u0027t necessary. Mrs. Grimesby was already ushering her in.\n Caroline, stripped down to her fashionable underwear, gave Elena what was undoubtedly meant to be a nonchalant look, but Elena detected the vicious gloating beneath. She kept her own eyes on the bundle of clothing Mrs. Grimesby was picking up off the bed.\n \"Here you are, Elena. One of our most nicely preserved pieces - and all authentic, too, even the ribbons. We believe this dress belonged to Honoria Fell.\"\n \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" said Elena, as Mrs. Grimesby shook out the folds of thin white material. \"What\u0027s it made of?\"\n \"Moravian muslin and silk gauze. Since it\u0027s quite cold today you can wear that velvet jacket over it.\" The librarian indicated a dusty rose garment lying over a chair back.\n Elena cast a surreptitious glance at Caroline as she began to change. Yes, there was the bag, at Caroline\u0027s feet. She debated making a grab for it, but Mrs. Grimesby was still in the room.\n The muslin dress was very simple, its flowing material belted high under the bosom with a pale rose.\n \"Did it really belong to Honoria Fell?\" she asked, thinking of the marble image of that lady lying on her tomb in the ruined church.\n \"That\u0027s the story, anyway,\" said Mrs. Grimesby. \"She mentions a dress like it in her journal, so we\u0027re pretty sure.\"\n \"She kept a journal?\" Elena was startled.\n \"Oh, yes. I have it in a case in the living room; I\u0027ll show it to you on the way out. Now for the jacket - oh, what\u0027s that?\"\n Something violet fluttered to the ground as Elena picked the jacket up.\n She could feel her expression freeze. She caught up the note before Mrs. Grimesby could bend over, and glanced at it.\n One line. She remembered writing it in her diary on September 4, the first day of school. Except that after she had written it she had crossed it out. These words were not crossed out; they were bold and clear.\n Something awful is going to happen today.\n Elena could barely restrain herself from rounding on Caroline and shaking the note in her face. But that would ruin everything. She forced herself to stay calm as she crumpled up the little slip of paper and threw it into a wastebasket.\n \"It\u0027s just a piece of trash,\" she said, and turned back to Mrs. Grimesby, her shoulders stiff. Caroline said nothing, but Elena could feel those triumphant green eyes on her.\n Just you wait, she thought. Wait until I get that diary back. I\u0027m going to burn it, and then you and I are going to have a talk.\n To Mrs. Grimesby she said, \"I\u0027m ready.\"\n \"So am I,\" said Caroline in a demure voice. Elena put on a look of cool indifference as she eyed the other girl. Caroline\u0027s pale green gown with long green and white sashes was not nearly as pretty as hers.\n \"Wonderful. You girls go ahead and wait for your rides. Oh, and Caroline, don\u0027t forget your reticule.\"\n \"I won\u0027t,\" Caroline said, smiling, and she reached for the drawstring bag at her feet.\n It was fortunate that from that position she couldn\u0027t see Elena\u0027s face, for in that instant the cool indifference shattered completely. Elena stared, dumbfounded, as Caroline began to tie the bag at her waist.\n Her astonishment didn\u0027t escape Mrs. Grimesby. \"That\u0027s a reticule, the ancestor of our modern handbag,\" the older woman explained kindly. \"Ladies used to keep their gloves and fans in them. Caroline came by.\n \"I\u0027m sure it was,\" Elena managed in a strangled voice. She had to get out of here or something awful was going to happen right now. She was going to start screaming - or knock Caroline down - or explode. \"I need some fresh air,\" she said. She bolted from the room and from the house, bursting outside.\n Bonnie and Meredith were waiting in Meredith\u0027s car. Elena\u0027s heart thumped strangely as she walked to it and leaned in the window.\n \"She\u0027s outsmarted us,\" she said quietly. \"That bag is part of her costume, and she\u0027s going to wear it all day.\"\n Bonnie and Meredith stared, first at her and then at each other.\n \"But... then, what are we going to do?\" Bonnie asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" With sick dismay this realization finally came home to Elena. \"I don\u0027t know!\"\n \"We can still watch her. Maybe she\u0027ll take the bag off at lunch or something...\" But Meredith\u0027s voice rang hollow. They all knew the truth, Elena thought, and the truth was that it was hopeless. They\u0027d lost. Bonnie glanced in the rearview mirror, then twisted in her seat. \"It\u0027s your ride.\"\n Elena looked. Two white horses were drawing a smartly renovated buggy down the street. Crepe paper was threaded through the buggy\u0027s wheels, ferns decorated its seats, and a large banner on the side proclaimed,The Spirit of Fell\u0027s Church.\n Elena had time for only one desperate message. \"Watch her,\" she said. \"And if there\u0027s ever a moment when she\u0027s alone...\" Then she had to go.\n But all through that long, terrible morning, there was never a moment when Caroline was alone. She was surrounded by a crowd of spectators.\n For Elena, the parade was pure torture. She sat in the buggy beside the mayor and his wife, trying to smile, trying to look normal. But the sick dread was like a crushing weight on her chest.\n Somewhere in front of her, among the marching bands and drill teams and open convertibles, was Caroline. Elena had forgotten to find out which float she was on. The first schoolhouse float, perhaps; a lot of the younger children in costume would be on that.\n It didn\u0027t matter. Wherever Caroline was, she was in full view of half the town.\n The luncheon that followed the parade was held in the high school cafeteria. Elena was trapped at a table with Mayor Dawley and his wife. Caroline was at a nearby table; Elena could see the shining back of her auburn head. And sitting beside her, often leaning possessively over her, was Tyler Smallwood. Elena was in a perfect position to view the little drama that occurred about halfway through lunch. Her heart leaped into her throat when she saw Stefan, looking casual, stroll by Caroline\u0027s table.\n He spoke to Caroline. Elena watched, forgetting even to play with the untouched food on her plate. But what she saw next made her heart plummet. Caroline tossed her head and replied to him briefly, and then Stefan looked toward Elena as he left, and for a moment their eyes met in wordless communion.\n There was nothing he could do, then. Even if his Powers had returned, Tyler was going to keep him away from Caroline. The crushing weight squeezed Elena\u0027s lungs so that she could scarcely breathe.\n After that she simply sat in a daze of misery and despair until someone nudged her and told her it was time to go backstage.\n She listened almost indifferently to Mayor Dawley\u0027s speech of welcome. He spoke about the \"trying time\" Fell\u0027s Church had faced recently, and about the community spirit that had sustained them these past months. Then awards were given out, for scholarship, for athletics, for community service. Matt came up to receive Outstanding Male Athlete of the Year, and Elena saw him look at her curiously.\n Then came the pageant. The elementary school children giggled and tripped and forgot their lines as they portrayed scenes from the founding of Fell\u0027s Church through the Civil War. Elena watched them without taking any of it in. Ever since last night she\u0027d been slightly dizzy and shaky, and now she felt as if she were coming down with the flu. Her brain, usually so full of schemes and calculations, was empty. She couldn\u0027t think anymore. She almost couldn\u0027t care.\n The pageant ended to popping flashbulbs and tumultuous applause. When the last little Confederate soldier was off the stage, Mayor Dawley called for silence.\n \"And now,\" he said, \"for the students who will perform the closing ceremonies. Please show your appreciation for the Spirit of Independence, the Spirit of Fidelity, and the Spirit of Fell\u0027s Church!\"\n The applause was even more thunderous. Elena stood beside John Clifford, the brainy senior who\u0027d been chosen to represent the Spirit of Independence. On the other side of John was Caroline. In a detached, nearly apathetic way Elena noticed that Caroline looked magnificent: her head tilted back, her eyes blazing, her cheeks flushed with color.\n John went first, adjusting his glasses and the microphone before he read from the heavy brown book on the lectern. Officially, the seniors were free to choose their own selections; in practice they almost always read from the works of M. C. Marsh, the only poet Fell\u0027s Church had ever produced.\n All during John\u0027s reading, Caroline was upstaging him. She smiled at the audience; she shook out her hair; she weighed the reticule hanging from her waist. Her fingers stroked the drawstring bag lovingly, and Elena found herself staring at it, hypnotized, memorizing every bead.\n John took a bow and resumed his place by Elena. Caroline threw her shoulders back and did a model\u0027s walk to the lectern.\n This time the applause was mixed with whistles. But Caroline didn\u0027t smile; she had assumed an air of tragic responsibility. With exquisite timing she waited until the cafetorium was perfectly quiet to speak.\n \"I was planning to read a poem by M. C. Marsh today,\" she said, then, into the attentive stillness, \"but I\u0027m not going to. Why read fromthis - \" She held up the nineteenth century volume of poetry. \" - when there is something much more... relevant... in a book I happened to find?\"\n Very slightly, almost imperceptibly, Stefan shook his head.\n Caroline\u0027s fingers were dipping into the bag as if she just couldn\u0027t wait. \"What I\u0027m going to read is about Fell\u0027s Churchtoday , not a hundred or two hundred years ago,\" she was saying, working herself up into a sort of exultant fever. \"It\u0027s importantnow , because it\u0027s about somebody who\u0027s living in town with us. In fact he\u0027s right here in this room.\"\n Tyler must have written the speech for her, Elena decided. Last month, in the gym, he\u0027d shown quite a gift for that kind of thing. Oh, Stefan, oh, Stefan, I\u0027m scared... Her thoughts jumbled into incoherence as Caroline plunged her hand into the bag.\n \"I think you\u0027ll understand what I mean when you hear it,\" Caroline said, and with a quick motion she pulled a velvet-covered book from the reticule and held it up dramatically. \"I think it will explain a lot of what\u0027s been going on in Fell\u0027s Church recently.\" Breathing quickly and lightly, she looked from the spellbound audience to the book in her hand.\n Elena had almost lost consciousness when Caroline jerked the diary out. Bright sparkles ran along the edges of her vision. The dizziness roared up, ready to overwhelm Elena, and then she noticed something.\n It must be her eyes. The stage lights and flashbulbs must have dazzled them. She certainly felt ready to faint any minute; it was hardly surprising that she couldn\u0027t see properly.\n The book in Caroline\u0027s hands lookedgreen , not blue.\n I must be going crazy... or this is a dream... or maybe it\u0027s a trick of the lighting. But look at Caroline\u0027s face!\n Caroline, mouth working, was staring at the velvet book. She seemed to have forgotten the audience altogether. She turned the diary over and over in her hands, looking at all sides of it. Her movements became frantic. She thrust a hand into the reticule as if she somehow hoped to find something else in it. Then she cast a wild glance around the stage as if what she was looking for might have fallen to the ground.\n The audience was murmuring, getting impatient. Mayor Dawley and the high school principal were exchanging tight-lipped frowns.\n Having found nothing on the floor, Caroline was staring at the small book again. But now she was gazing at it as if it were a scorpion. With a sudden gesture, she wrenched it open and looked inside, as if her last hope was that only the cover had changed and the words inside might be Elena\u0027s.\n Then she slowly looked up from the book at the packed cafetorium.\n Silence had descended again, and the moment drew out, while every eye remained fixed on the girl in the pale green gown. Then, with an inarticulate sound, Caroline whirled and clattered off the stage. She exploded into comment, argument, discussion. Elena found Stefan. He looked as if jubilation was sneaking up on him. But he also looked as bewildered as Elena felt. Bonnie and Meredith were the same. As Stefan\u0027s gaze crossed hers, Elena felt a rush of gratitude and joy, but her predominant emotion was awe.\n It was a miracle. Beyond all hope, they had been rescued. They\u0027d been saved.\n And then her eyes picked out another dark head among the crowd.\n Damon was leaning... no, lounging... against the north wall. His lips were curved into a half smile, and his eyes met Elena\u0027s boldly.\n Mayor Dawley was beside her, urging her forward, quieting the crowd, trying to restore order. It was no use. Elena read her selection in a dreamy voice to a babbling group of people who weren\u0027t paying attention in the slightest. She wasn\u0027t paying attention, either; she had no idea what words she was saying. Every so often she looked at Damon.\n There was applause, scattered and distracted, when she finished, and the mayor announced the rest of the events for that afternoon. And then it was all over, and Elena was free to go.\n She floated offstage without any conscious idea ofwhere she was going, but her legs carried her to the north wall. Damon\u0027s dark head moved out the side door and she followed it.\n The air in the courtyard seemed deliciously cool after the crowded room, and the clouds above were silvery and swirling. Damon was waiting for her.\n Her steps slowed but did not stop. She moved until she was only a foot or so away from him, her eyes searching his face.\n There was a long moment of silence and then she spoke. \"Why?\"\n \"I thought you\u0027d be more interested inhow. \" He patted his jacket significantly. \"I got invited in for coffee this morning after scraping up an acquaintance last week.\"\n \"But why?\"\n He shrugged, and for just an instant something like consternation flickered across his finely drawn features. It seemed to Elena that he himself didn\u0027t know why - or didn\u0027t want to admit it.\n \"For my own purposes,\" he said.\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Something was building between them, something that frightened Elena with its power.\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the reason at all.\"\n She moved closer, so that she was almost touching him, and looked at him. \"I think,\" she said, \"that maybe you need to be pushed.\"\n His face was only inches away from hers, and Elena never knew what might have happened if at that moment a voice hadn\u0027t broken in on them.\n \"Youdid manage to make it after all! I\u0027m so glad!\"\n It was Aunt Judith. Elena felt as if she were being whisked from one world to another. She blinked dizzily, stepping back, letting out a breath she hadn\u0027t realized she was holding.\n \"And so you got to hear Elena read,\" Aunt Judith continued happily. \"You did a beautiful job, Elena, but I don\u0027t know what was going on with Caroline. The girls in this town are all acting bewitched lately.\"\n \"Nerves,\" suggested Damon, his face carefully solemn. Elena felt an urge to giggle and then a wave of irritation. It was all very well to be grateful to Damon for saving them, but if not for Damon there wouldn\u0027t have been a problem in the first place. Damon had committed the crimes Caroline wanted to pin on Stefan.\n \"And whereis Stefan?\" she said, voicing her next thought aloud. She could see Bonnie and Meredith in the courtyard alone.\n Aunt Judith\u0027s face showed her disapproval. \"I haven\u0027t seen him,\" she said briefly. Then she smiled fondly.\n \"But I have an idea; why don\u0027t you come to dinner with us, Damon? Then afterwards perhaps you and Elena could - \"\n \"Stop it!\" said Elena to Damon. He looked politely inquiring.\n \"What?\" said Aunt Judith.\n \"Stop it!\" Elena said to Damon again. \"You know what. Just stop it right now!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-14.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
