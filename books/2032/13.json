She found it hard to move, so she lay there on her bed and tried to piece together what had happened last night.\n Damon. Damon had come here and threatened Margaret. And so Elena had gone to him. He\u0027d won.\n But why hadn\u0027t he finished it? Elena lifted a languid hand to touch the side of her neck, already knowing what she would find. Yes, there they were: two small punctures that were tender and sensitive to pressure.\n Yet she was still alive. He\u0027d stopped short of carrying out his promise. Why?\n Her memories of the last hours were confused and blurry. Only fragments were clear. Damon\u0027s eyes looking down at her, filling her whole world. The sharp sting at her throat. And, later, Damon opening his shirt, Damon\u0027s blood welling from a small cut in his neck.\n He\u0027d made her drink his blood then. Ifmade was the right word. She didn\u0027t remember putting up any resistance or feeling any revulsion. By then, she had wanted it.\n But she wasn\u0027t dead, or even seriously weakened. He hadn\u0027t made her into a vampire. And that was what she couldn\u0027t understand.\n He has no morals and no conscience, she reminded herself. So it certainly wasn\u0027t mercy that stopped him. He probably just wants to draw the game out, make you suffer more before he kills you. Or maybe he wants you to be like Vickie, with one foot in the shadow world and one in the light. Going slowly mad that way.\n One thing was sure: she wouldn\u0027t be fooled into thinking it was kindness on his part. Damon wasn\u0027t capable of kindness. Or of caring for anybody but himself.\n Pushing the blankets back, she rose from the bed. She could hear Aunt Judith moving around in the hallway. It was Monday morning and she had to get ready to go to school.\n Dear Diary,\n It\u0027s no good pretending I\u0027m not frightened, because I am. Tomorrow\u0027s Thanksgiving, and Founders\u0027 Day is two days after that. And I still haven\u0027t figured out a way to stop Caroline and Tyler.\n I don\u0027t know what to do. If I can\u0027t get my diary back from Caroline, she\u0027s going to read it in front of everyone. She\u0027ll have a perfect opportunity; she\u0027s one of the three seniors chosen to read poetry during the closing ceremonies. Chosen by the school board, of which Tyler\u0027s father is a member, I might add. I wonder what he\u0027ll think when this is all over?\n But what difference does it make? Unless I can come up with a plan, when this is all over I\u0027ll be beyond caring. And Stefan will be gone, run out of town by the good citizens of Fell\u0027s Church. Or dead, if he doesn\u0027t get some of his Powers back. And if he dies, I\u0027ll die too. It\u0027s that simple.\n Which means I have to find a way to get the diary. I have to.\n But I can\u0027t.\n I know, you\u0027re waiting for me to say it. There is a way to get my diary - Damon\u0027s way. All I need to do is agree to his price.\n But you don\u0027t understand how much that frightens me. Not just because Damon frightens me, but because I\u0027m afraid of what will happen if he and I are together again. I\u0027m afraid of what will happen to me... and to me and Stefan.\n I can\u0027t talk about this any more. It\u0027s too upsetting. I feel so confused and lost and alone. There\u0027s nobody I can turn to or talk to. Nobody who could possibly understand.\n What am I going to do?\n November 28, Thursday, 11:30p.m.\n Dear Diary,\n Things seem clearer today, maybe because I\u0027ve come to a decision. It\u0027s a decision that terrifies me, but it\u0027s better than the only alternative I can thinkof.\n I\u0027m going to tell Stefan everything.\n It\u0027s the only thing I can do now. Founders\u0027 Day is Saturday and I haven\u0027t come up with any plan of my own. But maybe Stefan can, if he realizes how desperate the situation is. I\u0027m going over to spend the day at the boarding house tomorrow, and when I get there I\u0027m going to tell him everything I should have told him in the first place.\n Everything. About Damon, too.\n Oh, I\u0027m scared. My stomach is churning. I could barely touch Thanksgiving dinner - and I can\u0027t keep still I feel as if I might fly apart into a million pieces. Go to sleep tonight? Ha.\n Please let Stefan understand. Please let him forgive me.\n The funniest thing is, I wanted to become a better person for him. I wanted to be worthy of his love. Stefan has these ideas about honor, about what\u0027s right and wrong. And now, when he finds out how I\u0027ve been lying to him, what will he think of me? Will he believe me, that I was only trying to protect him? Will he ever trust me again?\n Tomorrow I\u0027ll know. Oh, God, I wish it were already over. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll live until then.\n Elena slipped out of the house without telling Aunt Judith where she was going. She was tired of lies, but she didn\u0027t want to face the fuss there would inevitably be if she said she was going to Stefan\u0027s. Ever since Damon had come to dinner, Aunt Judith had been talking about him, throwing subtle and not-so-subtle hints into every conversation. And Robert was almost as bad. Elena sometimes thought he egged Aunt Judith on.\n She leaned on the doorbell of the boarding house wearily. Where was Mrs. Flowers these days? When the door finally opened, Stefan was behind it.\n He was dressed for outdoors, his jacket collar turned up. \"I thought we could go for a walk,\" he said.\n \"No.\" Elena was firm. She couldn\u0027t manage a real smile for him, so she stopped trying. She said, \"Let\u0027s go upstairs, Stefan, all right? There\u0027s something we need to talk about.\"\n He looked at her a moment in surprise. Something must have shown in her face, for his expression gradually stilled and darkened. He took a deep breath and nodded. Without a word, he turned and led the way to his room.\n The trunks and dressers and bookcases had long since been put back into order, of course. But Elena felt as if she was really noticing this for the first time. For some reason, she thought of the very first night she\u0027d been here, when Stefan had saved her from Tyler\u0027s disgusting embrace. Her eyes ran over the objects on the dresser: the fifteenth century gold florins, the ivory-hiked dagger, the little iron coffer with the hinged lid. She\u0027d tried to open that the first night and he\u0027d slammed the lid down.\n She turned. Stefan was standing by the window, outlined by the rectangle of gray and dismal sky. Every day this week had been chilly and misty, and this was no exception. Stefan\u0027s expression mirrored the weather outside.\n \"Well,\" he said quietly, \"what do we need to talk about?\"\n There was one last moment of choice, and then Elena committed herself. She stretched out a hand to the small iron coffer and opened it.\n Inside, a length of apricot silk shone with muted luster. Her hair ribbon. It reminded her of summer, of\n \"About this,\" she said.\n He had taken a step forward when she touched the coffer, but now he looked puzzled and surprised. \"Aboutthat ?\"\n \"Yes. Because I knew it was there, Stefan. I found it a long time ago, one day when you left the room for a few minutes. I don\u0027t know why I had to know what was in there, but I couldn\u0027t help it. So I found the ribbon. And then...\" She stopped and braced herself. \"Then I wrote about it in my diary.\"\n Stefan was looking more and more bewildered, as if this was not at all what he\u0027d been expecting. Elena groped for the right words.\n \"I wrote about it because I thought it was evidence that you\u0027d cared about me all along, enough to pick it up and keep it. I never thought it could be evidence of anything else.\"\n Then, suddenly, she was speaking quickly. She told him about taking her diary to Bonnie\u0027s house, about how it had been stolen. She told him about getting the notes, about realizing that Caroline was the one who was sending them. And then, turning away, pulling the summer-colored silk over and over through her nervous fingers, she told him about Caroline and Tyler\u0027s plan.\n Her voice almost gave out at the end. \"I\u0027ve been so frightened since then,\" she whispered, her eyes still on the ribbon. \"Scared that you\u0027d be angry with me. Scared of what they\u0027re going to do. Just scared. I tried to get the diary back, Stefan, I even went to Caroline\u0027s house. But she has it too well hidden.\n And I\u0027ve thought and thought, but I can\u0027t think of any way of stopping her from reading it.\" At last she looked up at him. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"You should be!\" he said, startling her with his vehemence. She felt the blood drain from her face. But Stefan was going on. \"You should be sorry for keeping something like that from me when I could have helped you. Elena, why didn\u0027t you justtell me?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s all my fault. And I had a dream...\" She tried to describe how he had looked in the dreams, the bitterness, the accusation in his eyes. \"I think I would die if you really looked at me that way,\" she concluded miserably.\n But Stefan\u0027s expression as he looked at her now was a combination of relief and wonder. \"So that\u0027s it,\" he said, almost in a whisper himself. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s been bothering you.\"\n Elena opened her mouth, but he was still speaking. \"I knew something was wrong, I knew you were holding something back. But I thought...\" He shook \"his head and a skewed smile tugged at his lips. \"It doesn\u0027t matter now. I didn\u0027t want to invade your privacy. I didn\u0027t even want to ask. And all the time you were worried about protectingme. \"\n Elena\u0027s tongue was stuck to the roof of her mouth. The words seemed to be stuck, too. There\u0027s more, she thought, but she couldn\u0027t say it, not when Stefan\u0027s eyes looked like that, not when his whole face was alight that way.\n \"When you said we needed to talk today, I thought you\u0027d changed your mind about me,\" he said simply, without self-pity. \"And I wouldn\u0027t have blamed you. But instead...\" He shook his head again. \"Elena,\" he said.\n It felt so good to be there, so right. She hadn\u0027t even realized how wrong things had been between them until now, when the wrongness had disappeared.This was what she remembered, what she had felt that first glorious night when Stefan had held her. All the sweetness and tenderness in the world surging between them. She was home, where she belonged. Where she would always belong.\n Everything else was forgotten.\n As she had in the beginning, Elena felt as if she could almost read Stefan\u0027s thoughts. They were connected, a part of each other. Their hearts beat to the same rhythm.\n Only one thing was needed to make it complete. Elena knew that, and she tossed her hair back, reaching from behind to pull it away from the side of her neck. And this time Stefan did not protest or thwart her. Instead of refusal he was radiating a deep acceptance - and a deep need.\n Feelings of love, of delight, of appreciation overwhelmed her and with incredulous joy she realized the feelings were his. For a moment, she sensed herself through his eyes, and sensed how much he cared for her. It might have been frightening if she had not had the same depth of feeling to give back to him.\n She felt no pain as his teeth pierced her neck. And it didn\u0027t even occur to her that she had unthinkingly offered him the unmarked side - even though the wounds Damon had left were healed already.\n She clung to him when he tried to lift his head. He was adamant, though, and at last she had to let him do it. Still holding her, he groped over onto the dresser for the wicked ivory-handled blade and with one quick motion he let his own blood flow.\n When Elena\u0027s knees grew weak, he sat her on the bed. And then they just held each other, unaware of time or anything else. Elena felt that only she and Stefan existed.\n \"I love you,\" he said softly.\n At first Elena, in her pleasant haze, simply accepted the words. Then, with a chill of sweetness, she realized what he\u0027d said.\n Heloved her. She\u0027d known it all along, but he had never said it before.\n \"I love you, Stefan,\" she whispered back. She was surprised when he shifted and pulled away slightly, until she saw what he was doing. Reaching inside his sweater, he drew out the chain he had worn around his neck ever since she had known him. On the chain was a gold ring, exquisitely crafted, set with lapis lazuli.\n Katherine\u0027s ring. As Elena watched, he took the chain off and unclasped it, removing the delicate golden band.\n \"When Katherine died,\" he said, \"I thought I could never love anyone else. Even though I knew she would have wanted me to, I was sure it could never happen. But I was wrong.\" He hesitated a moment and then went on.\n \"I kept the ring because it was a symbol of her. So I could keep her in my heart. But now I\u0027d like it to be a symbol of something else.\" Again he hesitated, seeming almost afraid to meet her eyes. \"Considering the\n and then gave up, his eyes meeting hers mutely.\n Elena couldn\u0027t speak. She couldn\u0027t even breathe. But Stefan misinterpreted her silence. The hope in his eyes died and he turned away.\n \"You\u0027re right,\" he said. \"It\u0027s all impossible. There are just too many difficulties - because of me. Because of what I am. Nobody like you should be tied to someone like me. I shouldn\u0027t even have suggested it - \"\n \"Stefan!\" said Elena. \"Stefan, if you\u0027ll be quiet a moment - \"\n \" - so just forget I said anything - \"\n \"Stefan!\" she said. \"Stefan,look at me. \"\n Slowly, he obeyed, turning back. He looked into her eyes, and the bitter self-condemnation faded from his face, to be replaced by a look that made her lose her breath again. Then, still slowly, he took the hand she was holding out. Deliberately, as they both watched, he slipped the ring onto her finger.\n It fit as if it had been made for her. The gold glinted richly in the light, and the lapis shone a deep vibrant blue like a clear lake surrounded by untouched snow.\n \"We\u0027ll have to keep it a secret for a while,\" she said, hearing the tremor in her voice.\n \"Aunt Judith will have a fit if she knows I\u0027m engaged before I graduate. But I\u0027ll be eighteen next summer, and then she can\u0027t stop us.\"\n \"Elena, are you sure this is what you want? It won\u0027t be easy living with me. I\u0027ll always be different from you, no matter how I try. If you ever want to change your mind...\"\n \"As long as you love me, I\u0027ll never change my mind.\"\n He took her in his arms again, and peace and contentment enfolded her. But there was still one fear that gnawed at the edges of her consciousness.\n \"Stefan, about tomorrow - if Caroline and Tyler carry out their plan, it won\u0027t matter if I change my mind or not.\"\n \"Then we\u0027ll just have to make sure they can\u0027t carry it out. If Bonnie and Meredith will help me, I think I can find a way to get the diary from Caroline. But even if I can\u0027t, I\u0027m not going to run. I won\u0027t leave you, Elena; I\u0027m going to stay and fight.\"\n \"But they\u0027ll hurt you. Stefan, I can\u0027t stand that.\"\n \"And I can\u0027t leave you. That\u0027s settled. Let me worry about the rest of it; I\u0027ll find a way. And if I don\u0027t... well, no matter what I\u0027ll stay with you. We\u0027ll be together.\"\n \"We\u0027ll be together,\" Elena repeated, and rested her head on his shoulder, happy to stop thinking for a while and justbe.\n Dear Diary,\n It\u0027s late but I couldn\u0027t sleep. I don\u0027t seem to need as much sleep as I used to.\n Well, tomorrow\u0027s the day.\n We talked to Bonnie and Meredith tonight. Stefan\u0027s plan is simplicity itself. The thing is, no matter where Caroline has hidden the diary, she has to bring it out tomorrow to take it with her. But our readings are the last thing on the agenda, and she has to be in the parade and everything first. She\u0027ll have to stash the diary somewhere during that time. So if we watch her from the minute she leaves her house until she gets up on stage, we should be able to see where she puts it down. And since she doesn\u0027t even know we\u0027re suspicious, she won\u0027t be on guard.\n That\u0027s when we get it.\n The reason the plan will work is because everyone in the program will be in period dress. Mrs. Grimesby, the librarian, will help us put on our 19th century clothes before the parade, and we can\u0027t be wearing or carrying anything that\u0027s not part of the costume. No purses, no backpacks. No diaries! Caroline will have to leave it behind at some point.\n We\u0027re taking turns watching her. Bonnie is going to wait outside her house and see what Caroline\u0027s carrying when she leaves. I\u0027ll watch her when she gets dressed at Mrs. Grimesby\u0027s house. Then, while the parade is going on, Stefan and Meredith will break into the house - or the Forbes\u0027 car, if that\u0027s where it is - and do their stuff.\n I don\u0027t see how it can fail. And I can\u0027t tell you how much better I feel. It\u0027s so good just to be able to share this problem with Stefan. I\u0027ve learned my lesson; I\u0027ll never keep things from him again.\n I\u0027m wearing my ring tomorrow. If Mrs. Grimesby asks me about it, I\u0027ll tell her it\u0027s even older than 19th century, it\u0027s from Renaissance Italy. I\u0027d like to see her face when I say that.\n I\u0027d better try to get some sleep now. I hope I don\u0027t dream. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-13.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
