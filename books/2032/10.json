{"id":108718,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"The bell rang. There was no time to go back to the cafeteria and tell Bonnie and Meredith. Elena set off for her next class, past the averted faces and hostile eyes that were becoming all too familiar these days. It was hard, in history class, not to stare at Caroline, not to let Caroline know she knew. Alaric asked about Matt and Stefan being absent for the second day in a row, and Elena shrugged, feeling exposed and on display. She didn\u0027t trust this man with the boyish smile and the hazel eyes and the thirst for knowledge about Mr. Tanner\u0027s death. And Bonnie, who simply gazed at Alaric soulfully, was no help at all. After class she caught a scrap of Sue Carson\u0027s conversation. \"... he\u0027s on vacation from college - I forget exactly where...\" Elena had had enough of discreet silence. She spun around and spoke directly to Sue and the girl Sue was talking to, bursting uninvited into their discussion. \"If I were you,\" she said to Sue, \"I would keep away from Damon. I mean that.\" There was startled, embarrassed laughter. Sue was one of the few people at school who hadn\u0027t shunned Elena, and now she was looking as if she wished she had. \"You mean,\" said the other girl hesitantly, \"because he\u0027s yours, too? Or - \" Elena\u0027s own laughter was harsh. \"I mean because he\u0027sdangerous ,\" she said. \"And I\u0027m not joking.\" They just looked at her. Elena saved them the further embarrassment of having to reply or to get tactfully groupies and headed for Meredith\u0027s locker. \"Where are we going? I thought we were going to talk to Caroline.\" \"Not anymore,\" Elena said. \"Wait until we get home. Then I\u0027ll tell you why.\" \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" said Bonnie an hour later. \"I mean, I believe it, but I can\u0027tbelieve it. Not even of Caroline.\" \"It\u0027s Tyler,\" Elena said. \"He\u0027s the one with the big plans. So much for men not being interested in diaries.\" \"Actually, we should thank him,\" said Meredith. \"Because of him at least we have until Founders\u0027 Day to do something about it.Why did you say it was supposed to be on Founders\u0027 Day, Elena?\" \"Tyler has something against the Fells.\" \"But they\u0027re all dead,\" said Bonnie. \"Well, that doesn\u0027t seem to matter to Tyler. I remember him talking about it in the graveyard, too, when we were looking at their tomb. He thinks they stole his ancestors\u0027 rightful place as the town\u0027s founders or something.\" \"Elena,\" Meredith said seriously, \"is there anything else in the diary that could hurt Stefan? Besides the thing about the old man, I mean.\" \"Isn\u0027t that enough?\" With those steady, dark eyes on her, Elena felt discomfort flutter between her ribs. What was Meredith asking? \"Enough to get Stefan run out of town like they said,\" agreed Bonnie. \"Enough that we have to get the diary back from Caroline,\" Elena said. \"The only question is, how?\" \"Caroline said she had it hidden somewhere safe. That probably means her house.\" Meredith chewed her lip thoughtfully. \"She\u0027s got just the one brother in eighth grade, right? And her mom doesn\u0027t work, but she goes shopping in Roanoke a lot. Do they still have a maid?\" \"Why?\" said Bonnie. \"What difference does it make?\" \"Well, we don\u0027t want anybody walking in while we\u0027re burglarizing the house.\" \"While we\u0027rewhat ?\" Bonnie\u0027s voice rose to a squeak. \"You can\u0027t be serious!\" \"What are we supposed to do, just sit back and wait until Founders\u0027 Day, and let her read Elena\u0027s diary in front of the town?She stole it from your house. We\u0027ve just got to steal it back,\" Meredith said, maddeningly calm. \"We\u0027ll get caught. We\u0027ll get expelled from school - if we don\u0027t end up going to jail.\" Bonnie turned to Elena in appeal. \"Tell her, Elena.\" Besides, it seemed such a... aviolation , to go into someone\u0027s house when they were not there, to search their possessions. She would hate it if someone did that to her. But, of course, someone had. Caroline had violated Bonnie\u0027s house, and right now had Elena\u0027s most private possession in her hands. \"Let\u0027s do it,\" Elena said quietly. \"But let\u0027s be careful.\" \"Can\u0027t we talk about this?\" said Bonnie weakly, looking from Meredith\u0027s determined face to Elena\u0027s. \"There\u0027s nothing to talk about. You\u0027re coming,\" Meredith told her. \"You promised,\" she added, as Bonnie took a breath to object afresh. And she held up her index finger. \"The blood oath was only to help Elenaget Stefan!\" Bonnie cried. \"Think again,\" said Meredith. \"You swore you would do whatever Elena asked in relation to Stefan. There wasn\u0027t anything about a time limit or about \u0027only until Elena gets him.\u0027 \" Bonnie\u0027s mouth dropped open. She looked at Elena, who was almost laughing in spite of herself. \"It\u0027s true,\" Elena said solemnly. \"And you said it yourself: \u0027Swearing with blood means you have to stick to your oath no matter what happens.\u0027 \" Bonnie shut her mouth and thrust her chin out. \"Right,\" she said grimly. \"Now I\u0027m stuck for the rest of my life doing whatever Elena wants me to do about Stefan. Wonderful.\" \"This is the last thing I\u0027ll ever ask,\" Elena said. \"And I promise that. I swear - \" \"Don\u0027t!\" said Meredith, suddenly serious. \"Don\u0027t, Elena. You might be sorry later.\" \"Now you\u0027re taking up prophecy, too?\" Elena said. And then she asked, \"So how are we going to get hold of Caroline\u0027s house key for an hour or so?\" November9,Saturday Dear Diary, I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s been so long. Lately I\u0027ve been too busy or too depressed - or both - to write you. Besides, with everything that\u0027s happened I\u0027m almost afraid to keep a diary at all anymore. But I need someone to turn to, because right now there\u0027s not a single human being, not a single person on earth, that I\u0027m not keeping something from. Bonnie and Meredith can\u0027t know the truth about Stefan. Stefan can\u0027t know the truth about Damon. Aunt Judith can\u0027t know about anything. Bonnie and Meredith know about Caroline and the diary; Stefan doesn\u0027t.Stefan knows about the vervain I use every day now, Bonnie and Meredith don\u0027t. Even My life is full of lies right now, and I need someoneto be completely honest with. I\u0027m going to hide this diary under the loose floorboard in the closet, so that no one will find it even if I drop dead and they clean out my room. Maybe one of Margaret\u0027s grandchildren will be playing in there someday, and will pry up the board and pull it out, but until then, nobody. This diary is my last secret. I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m thinking about death and dying. That\u0027s Bonnie\u0027s craze; she\u0027s the one who thinks it would be so romantic. I know what it\u0027s really like; there was nothing romantic about it when Mom and Dad died. Just the worst feelings in the world. I want to live for a good long time, marry Stefan, and be happy. And there\u0027s no reason why I can\u0027t, once all these problems are behind us. Except that there are times when I get scared and I don\u0027t believe that. And there are little things that shouldn\u0027t matter, but they bother me. Like why Stefan still wears Catherine\u0027s ring around his neck, even though I know he loves me. Like why he\u0027s never said he loves me, even though I know it\u0027s true. It doesn\u0027t matter. Everything will work out. It has to work out. And then we\u0027ll be together and be happy. There\u0027s no reason why we can\u0027t. There\u0027s no reason why we can\u0027t. There\u0027s no reason. Elena stopped writing, trying to keep the letters on the page in focus. But they only blurred further, and she shut the book before a betraying teardrop could fall on the ink. Then she went over to the closet, pried up the loose board with a nail file, and put the diary there. She had the nail file in her pocket a week later as the three of them, she and Bonnie and Meredith, stood outside Caroline\u0027s back door. \"Hurry up,\" hissed Bonnie in agony, looking around the yard as if she expected something to jump out at them. \"Come on, Meredith!\" \"There,\" said Meredith, as the key finally went the right way into the dead bolt lock and the doorknob yielded to her turning fingers. \"We\u0027re in.\" \"Are you surethey\u0027re not in? Elena, what if they come back early? Why couldn\u0027t we do this in the daytime, at least?\" \"Bonnie, will you getinside ? We\u0027ve been through all this. The maid\u0027s always here in the daytime. And they won\u0027t be back early tonight unless somebody gets sick at Chez Louis. Now, come on!\" said Elena. \"Nobody would dare to get sick at Mr. Forbes\u0027s birthday dinner,\" Meredith said comfortingly to Bonnie as the smaller girl stepped in. \"We\u0027re safe.\" \"If they\u0027ve got enough money to go to expensive restaurants, you\u0027d think they could afford to leave a few lights on,\" said Bonnie, refusing to be comforted. Privately, Elena agreed with this. It was strange and disconcerting to be wandering through someone else\u0027s house in the dark, and her heart pounded chokingly as they went up the stairs. Her palm, clutching \"It\u0027s got to be in her bedroom,\" she said. Caroline\u0027s window faced the street, which meant they had to be even more careful not to show a light there. Elena swung the tiny beam of the flashlight around with a feeling of dismay. It was one thing to plan to search someone\u0027s room, to picture efficiently and methodically going through drawers. It was another thing actually to be standing here, surrounded by what seemed like thousands of places to hide something, and feeling afraid to touch anything in case Caroline noticed it had been disturbed. The other two girls were also standing still. \"Maybe we should just go home,\" Bonnie said quietly. And Meredith did not contradict her. \"We have to try. At least try,\" said Elena, hearing how tinny and hollow her voice sounded. She eased open a drawer on the highboy and shone the light onto dainty piles of lacy underwear. A moment\u0027s poking through them assured her there was nothing like a book there. She straightened the piles and shut the drawer again. Then she let out her breath. \"It\u0027s not that hard,\" she said. \"What we need to do is divide up the room and then searcheverything in our section, every drawer, every piece of furniture, every object big enough to hide a diary in.\" She assigned herself the closet, and the first thing she did was prod at the floorboards with her nail file. But Caroline\u0027s boards all seemed to be secure and the walls of the closet sounded solid. Rummaging through Caroline\u0027s clothes she found several things she\u0027d lent the other girl last year. She was tempted to take them back, but of course she couldn\u0027t. A search of Caroline\u0027s shoes and purses revealed nothing, even when she dragged a chair over so that she could investigate the top shelf of the closet thoroughly. Meredith was sitting on the floor examining a pile of stuffed animals that had been relegated to a chest with other childish mementos. She ran her long sensitive fingers over each, checking for slits in the material. When she reached a fluffy poodle, she paused. \"I gave this to her,\" she whispered. \"I think for her tenth birthday. I thought she\u0027d thrown it away.\" Elena couldn\u0027t see her eyes; Meredith\u0027s own flashlight was turned on the poodle. But she knew how Meredith was feeling. \"I tried to make up with her,\" she said softly. \"I did, Meredith, at the Haunted House. But she as good as told me she would never forgive me for taking Stefan from her. I wish things could be different, but she won\u0027t let them be.\" \"So now it\u0027s war.\" \"So now it\u0027s war,\" said Elena, flat and final. She watched as Meredith put the poodle aside and picked up the next animal. Then she turned back to her own search. But she had no better luck with the dresser than she had with the closet. And with every moment that passed she felt more uneasy, more certain that they were about to hear a car pulling into the Forbes\u0027 driveway. \"I\u0027ve got it. Elena, it\u0027s a diary!\" Relief swooped through Elena then, and she felt like a crumpled piece of paper being straightened and smoothed. She could move again. Breathing was wonderful. She\u0027d known, she\u0027d known all along that nothingreally terrible could happen to Stefan. Life couldn\u0027t be that cruel, not to Elena Gilbert. They were all safe now. But Meredith\u0027s voice was puzzled. \"It\u0027s a diary. But it\u0027s green, not blue. It\u0027s the wrong one.\" \"What?\" Elena snatched the little book, shining her light on it, trying to make the emerald green of the cover change into sapphire blue. It didn\u0027t work. This diary was almost exactly like hers, but it wasn\u0027t hers. \"It\u0027s Caroline\u0027s,\" she said stupidly, still not wanting to believe it. Bonnie and Meredith crowded close. They all looked at the closed book, and then at one another. \"There might be clues,\" said Elena slowly. \"It\u0027s only fair,\" agreed Meredith. But it was Bonnie who actually took the diary and opened it. Elena peered over her shoulder at Caroline\u0027s spiky back-slanted writing, so different from the block letters of the purple notes. At first her eyes wouldn\u0027t focus, but then a name leapt out at her.Elena. \"Wait, what\u0027s that?\" Bonnie, who was the only one actually in a position to read more than one or two words, was silent a moment, her lips moving. Then she snorted. \"Listen to this,\" she said, and read: \" \u0027Elena\u0027s the most selfish person I\u0027ve ever known. Everyone thinks she\u0027s so together, but it\u0027s really just coldness. It\u0027s sickening the way people suck up to her, never realizing that she doesn\u0027t give a damn about anyone or anything except Elena.\u0027 \" \"Carolinesays that? She should talk!\" But Elena could feel heat in her face. It was, practically, what Matt had said about her when she was after Stefan. \"Go on, there\u0027s more,\" said Meredith, poking at Bonnie, who continued in an offended voice. \" \u0027Bonnie\u0027s almost as bad these days, always trying to make herself important. The newest thing is pretending she\u0027s psychic so people will pay attention to her. If she wasreally psychic she\u0027d figure out that Elena is just using her. There was a heavy pause, and then Elena said, \"Is that all?\" \"No, there\u0027s a bit about Meredith. \u0027Meredith doesn\u0027t do anything to stop it. In fact, Meredith doesn\u0027tdo anything; she just watches. It\u0027s as if she can\u0027t act; she can onlyreact to things. Besides, I\u0027ve heard my parents talking about her family - no wonder she never mentions them.\u0027 What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"Try around October eighteenth. That was when it was stolen,\" said Elena, putting her questions aside. She\u0027d ask Meredith about it later. There was no entry for October eighteenth or the weekend after; in fact, there were only a few entries for the following weeks. None of them mentioned the diary. \"Well, that\u0027s it then,\" said Meredith, sitting back. \"This book is useless. Unless we want to blackmailher with it. You know, like we won\u0027t show hers if she won\u0027t show yours.\" It was a tempting idea, but Bonnie spotted the flaw. \"There\u0027s nothing bad about Caroline in here; it\u0027s all just complaints about other people. Mostly us. I\u0027ll bet Caroline wouldlove to have it read out loud in front of the whole school. It\u0027d make her day.\" \"So what do we do with it?\" \"Put it back,\" said Elena tiredly. She swung her light around the room, which seemed to her eyes to be filled with subtle differences from when they\u0027d come in. \"We\u0027ll just have to keep on pretending we don\u0027t know she has my diary, and hope for another chance.\" \"All right,\" said Bonnie, but she went on thumbing through the little book, occasionally giving vent to an indignant snort or hiss. \"Will you listen to this!\" she exclaimed. \"There isn\u0027t time,\" Elena said. She would have said something else, but at that moment Meredith spoke, her tone commanding everyone\u0027s immediate attention. \"A car.\" It took only a second to ascertain that the vehicle was pulling up into the Forbes\u0027 driveway. Bonnie\u0027s eyes and mouth were wide and round and she seemed to be paralyzed, kneeling by the bed. \"Go! Go on,\" said Elena, snatching the di-ary from her. \"Turn the flashlights off and get out the back door.\" They were already moving, Meredith urging Bonnie forward. Elena dropped to her knees and lifted the bedspread, pulling up at Caroline\u0027s mattress. With her other hand she pushed the diary forward, wedging it between the mattress and the dust ruffle. The thinly covered box springs bit into her arm from below, but even worse was the weight of the queen-size mattress bearing down from above. She gave the book a few more nudges with her fingertips and then pulled her arm out, tugging the bedspread back in place. She gave one wild glance back at the room as she left; there was no time to fix anything more now. As she moved swiftly and silently toward the stairs, she heard a key in the front door. What followed was a sort of dreadful game of tag. Elena knew they were not deliberately chasing her, but the Forbes family seemed determined to corner her in their house. She turned back the way she had come as voices and lights materialized in the hall as they headed up the stairs. She fled from them into the last doorway down the hall, and they seemed to follow. They moved across the landing; they were right outside the master bedroom. She turned toward the adjoining bathroom, but then saw lights spring to life She was trapped. At any moment Caroline\u0027s parents might come in. She saw the french windows leading to a balcony and made her decision in that same instant. Outside, the air was cool, and her panting breath showed faintly. Yellow light burst forth from the room beside her, and she huddled even farther to the left, keeping out of its path. Then, the sound she had been dreading came with terrible clarity: the snick of a door handle, followed by a billowing of curtains inward as the french windows opened. She looked around frantically. It was too far to jump to the ground, and there was nothing to grab hold of to climb down. That left only the roof, but there was nothing to climb up, either. Still, some instinct made her try, and she was on the balcony railing and groping for a handhold above even as a shadow appeared on the filmy curtains. A hand parted them, a figure began to emerge, and then Elena felt something clasping her own hand, locking on her wrist and hauling her upwards. Automatically, she boosted with her feet and felt herself scrambling onto the shingled roof. Trying to calm her ragged breath, she looked over gratefully to see who her rescuer was - and froze.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-10.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
