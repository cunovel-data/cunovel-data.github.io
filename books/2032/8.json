She looked just like she did when we found her on the road, only then she was all scratched up, too.\" \"Cat scratches, we thought,\" said Meredith, finishing the last bite of her cake. She seemed to be in one of her quiet, thoughtful moods; right now she was watching Elena closely. \"But that doesn\u0027t seem very likely.\" Elena looked straight back at her. \"Maybe she fell in some brambles,\" she said. \"Now, if you guys are finished eating, do you want to see that first note?\" They left their dishes in the sink and climbed the stairs to Elena\u0027s room. Elena felt herself flush as the other girls read the note. Bonnie and Meredith were her best friends, maybe her only friends now. She\u0027d read them passages from her diary before. But this was different. It was the most humiliating feeling she\u0027d ever had. \"Well?\" she said to Meredith. \"The person who wrote this is five feet eleven inches tall, walks with a slight limp, and wears a false mustache,\" Meredith intoned. \"Sorry,\" she added, seeing Elena\u0027s face. \"Not funny. Actually, there\u0027s not much to go on, is there? The writing looks like a guy\u0027s, but the paper looks feminine.\" \"And the whole thing has sort of a feminine touch,\" put in Bonnie, bouncing slightly on Elena\u0027s bed. \"Well, it does,\" she said defensively. \"Quoting bits of your diary back at you is the kind of thing a woman would think of. Men don\u0027t care about diaries.\" \"You just don\u0027t want it to be Damon,\" said Meredith. \"I would think you\u0027d be more worried about him being a psycho killer than a diary thief.\" \"I don\u0027t know; killers are sort of romantic. Imagine your dying with his hands around your throat. He\u0027d strangle the life out of you, and the last thing you\u0027d see would be his face.\" Putting her own hands to her throat, Bonnie gasped and expired tragically, ending up draped across the bed. \"He can have me anytime,\" she said, eyes still closed. It was on Elena\u0027s lips to say, \"Don\u0027t you understand, this isserious ,\" but instead she hissed in a breath. \"Oh,God ,\" she said, and ran to the window. The day was humid and stifling, and the window had been opened. Outside on the skeletal branches of the quince tree was a crow. Elena threw the sash down so hard that the glass rattled and tinkled. The crow gazed at her through the trembling panes with eyes like obsidian. Rainbows glimmered in its sleek black plumage. \"Why did yousay that?\" she said, turning to Bonnie. \"Hey, there\u0027s nobody out there,\" said Meredith gently. \"Unless you count the birds.\" Elena turned away from them. The tree was empty now. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Bonnie in a small voice, after a moment. \"It\u0027s just that it all doesn\u0027t seem real sometimes, even Mr. Tanner\u0027s being dead doesn\u0027t seem real. And Damon did look... well, exciting. But dangerous. I \"And besides, he wouldn\u0027t squeeze your throat; he\u0027d cut it,\" Meredith said. \"Or at least that was what he did to Tanner. But the old man under the bridge had his throat ripped open, as if some animal had done it.\" Meredith looked to Elena for clarification. \"Damon doesn\u0027t have an animal, does he?\" \"No. I don\u0027t know.\" Suddenly, Elena felt very tired. She was worried about Bonnie, about the consequences of those foolish words. \"I can do anything to you, to you and the ones you love,\" she remembered. What might Damon do now? She didn\u0027t understand him. He was different every time they met. In the gym he\u0027d been taunting, laughing at her. But the next time she would swear that he\u0027d been serious, quoting poetry to her, trying to get her to come away with him. Last week, with the icy graveyard wind lashing around him, he\u0027d been menacing, cruel. And underneath his mocking words last night, she\u0027d felt the same menace. She couldn\u0027t predict what he\u0027d do next. But, whatever happened, she had to protect Bonnie and Meredith from him. Especially since she couldn\u0027t warn them properly. And what was Stefan up to? She needed him right now, more than anything. Wherewas he? It started that morning. \"Let me get this straight,\" Matt said, leaning against the scarred body of his ancient Ford sedan when Stefan approached him before school. \"You want to borrow my car.\" \"Yes,\" Stefan said. \"And the reason you want to borrow it is flowers. You want to get some flowers for Elena.\" \"Yes.\" \"And these particular flowers, these flowers you\u0027ve just got to get, don\u0027t grow around here.\" \"They might. But their blooming season is over this far north. And the frost would have finished them off anyway.\" \"So you want to go down south - how far south you don\u0027t know - to find some of these flowers that you\u0027ve just got to give to Elena.\" \"Or at least some of the plants,\" Stefan said. \"I\u0027d rather have the actual flowers though.\" \"And since the police still have your car, you want to borrow mine, for however long it takes you to go down south and find these flowers that you\u0027ve just got to give to Elena.\" \"I figure driving is the least conspicuous way to leave town,\" Stefan explained. \"I don\u0027t want the police to follow me.\" \"Uh huh. And that\u0027s why you want my car.\" \"Am I going to give my car to the guy who stole my girlfriend and now wants to take a jaunt down south to get her some kind of special flowers she\u0027s just got to have? Are you crazy?\" Matt, who had been staring out over the roofs of the frame houses across the street, turned at last to look at Stefan. His blue eyes, usually cheerful and straightforward, were full of utter disbelief, and surmounted by twisted, puckered brows. Stefan looked away. He should have known better. After everything Matt had already done for him, to expect more was ridiculous. Especially these days, when people flinched from the sound of his step and avoided his eyes when he came near. To expect Matt, who had the best of reasons to resent him, to do him such a favor with no explanation, on the basis of faith alone, reallywas insane. \"No, I\u0027m not crazy,\" he said quietly, and turned to go. \"Neither am I,\" Matt had said. \"And I\u0027d have to be crazy to turn my car over to you. Hell, no. I\u0027m going with you.\" By the time Stefan had turned back around, Matt was looking at the car instead of him, lower lip thrust forward in a wary, judicious pout. \"After all,\" he\u0027d said, rubbing at the flaking vinyl of the roof, \"you might scratch the paint or something.\" Elena put the phone back on the hook.Somebody was at the boarding house, because somebody kept picking up the phone when it rang, but after that there was only silence and then the click of disconnection. She suspected it was Mrs. Flowers, but that didn\u0027t tell her anything about where Stefan was. Instinctively, she wanted to go to him. But it was dark outside, and Stefan had warned her specifically not to go out in the dark, especially not anywhere near the cemetery or the woods. The boarding house was near both. \"No answer?\" said Meredith as Elena came back and sat down on the bed. \"She keeps hanging up on me,\" Elena said, and muttered something under her breath. \"Did you say she was a witch?\" \"No, but it rhymes with that,\" said Elena. \"Look,\" said Bonnie, sitting up. \"If Stefan\u0027s going to call, he\u0027ll call here. There\u0027s no reason for you to come and stay the night with me.\" Therewas a reason, although Elena couldn\u0027t quite explain it even to herself. After all, Damon had kissed Bonnie at Alaric Saltzman\u0027s party. It was Elena\u0027s fault that Bonnie was in danger in the first place. Somehow she felt that if she were at least on the scene, she might be able to protect Bonnie. \"My mom and dad and Mary are all home,\" Bonnie persisted. \"And we lock all our doors and windows and everything since Mr. Tanner was murdered. This weekend Dad even put on extra locks. I don\u0027t see whatyou can do.\" She left a message for Stefan with Aunt Judith, telling him where she was. There was still a lingering constraint between her and her aunt. And there would be, Elena thought, until Aunt Judith changed her mind about Stefan. At Bonnie\u0027s house, she was given a room that had belonged to one of Bonnie\u0027s sisters who was now in college. The first thing she did was check the window. It was closed and locked, and there was nothing outside that someone could climb, like a drainpipe or tree. As inconspicuously as possible, she also checked Bonnie\u0027s room and any others she could get into. Bonnie was right; they were all sealed up tight from the inside. Nothing from the outside could get in. She lay in bed a long time that night, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. She kept remembering Vickie dreamily doing a striptease in the cafeteria. What was wrong with the girl? She would remember to ask Stefan that next time she saw him. Thoughts of Stefan were pleasant, even with all the terrible things that had happened recently. Elena smiled in the darkness, letting her mind wander. Someday all this harassment would be over, and she and Stefan could plan a life together. Of course, he hadn\u0027t actually said anything about that, but Elena herself was sure. She was going to marry Stefan, or no one. And Stefan was going to marry no one but her... The transition into dreaming was so smooth and gradual that she scarcely noticed it. But she knew, somehow, that shewas dreaming. It was as if a little part of her was standing aside and watching the dream like a play. She was sitting in a long hallway, which was covered with mirrors on one side and windows on the other. She was waiting for something. Then she saw a flicker of movement, and Stefan was standing outside the window. His face was pale and his eyes were hurt and angry. She went over to the window, but she couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying because of the glass. In one hand, he was holding a book with a blue velvet cover, and he kept gesturing to it and asking her something. Then he dropped the book and turned away. \"Stefan, don\u0027t go! Don\u0027t leave me!\" she cried. Her fingers flattened whitely on the glass. Then she noticed that there was a latch on one side of the window and she opened it, calling to him. But he had disappeared and outside she saw only swirling white mist. Disconsolately, she turned away from the window and began walking down the hall. Her own image glimmered in mirror after mirror as she went by them. Then something about one of the reflections caught her eye. The eyes were her eyes, but there was a new look in them, a predatory, sly look. Vickie\u0027s eyes had looked that way when she was undressing. And there was something disturbing and hungry about her smile. As she watched, standing still, the image suddenly whirled around and around, as if dancing. Horror swept over Elena. She began to run down the hall, but now all the reflections had a life of their own, dancing, beckoning to her, laughing at her. Just when she thought her heart and lungs would burst with terror, she reached the end of the corridor and flung open a door. She was standing in a large and beautiful room. The lofty ceiling was intricately carved and inlaid with gold; the doorways were faced with white marble. Classical statues stood in niches along the walls. Elena had never seen a room of such splendor, but she knew where she was. In Renaissance Italy, when Stefan She looked down at herself and saw she was wearing a dress like the one she\u0027d had made for Halloween, the ice blue Renaissance ball gown. But this dress was a deep ruby red, and around her waist she wore a thin chain set with brilliant red stones. The same stones were in her hair. When she moved, the silk shimmered like flames in the light of hundreds of torches. At the far end of the room, two huge doors swung inward. A figure appeared between them. It walked toward her, and she saw that it was a young man dressed in Renaissance clothing, doublet and hose and fur-trimmed jerkin. Stefan! She started toward him eagerly, feeling the weight of her dress swing from the waist. But when she got closer she stopped, drawing in a sharp breath. It was Damon. He kept on walking toward her, confident, casual. He was smiling, a smile of challenge. Reaching her, he put one hand over his heart and bowed. Then he held out the hand to her as if daring her to take it. \"Do you like dancing?\" he said. Except that his lips didn\u0027t move. The voice was in her mind. Her fear drained away, and she laughed. What was wrong with her, to have ever been afraid of him? They understood each other very well. But instead of taking his hand, she turned away, the silk of the dress turning after her. She moved lightly toward one of the statues along the wall, not glancing back to see if he was following her. She knew he would. She pretended to be absorbed in the statue, moving away again just as he reached her, biting her lip to hold in the laughter. She felt wonderful right now, so alive, so beautiful. Dangerous? Of course, this game was dangerous. But she had always enjoyed danger. The next time he drew near her, she glanced at him teasingly as she turned. He reached out, but caught only the jeweled chain at her waist. He let go quickly, and, looking back, she saw that the pronged setting on one of the gems had cut him. The drop of blood on his finger was just the color of her dress. His eyes flashed at her sideways, and his lips curved in a taunting smile as he held the wounded finger up. You wouldn\u0027t dare, those eyes said. Oh, wouldn\u0027t I? Elena told him with her own eyes. Boldly, she took his hand and held it a moment, teasing him. Then she brought the finger to her lips. After a few moments, she released it and looked up at him. \"Ido like dancing,\" she said, and found that, like him, she could speak with her mind. It was a thrilling sensation. She moved to the center of the room and waited. He followed her, graceful as a stalking beast. His fingers were warm and hard when they clasped hers. There was music, although it faded in and out and sounded far away. Damon placed his other hand on her waist. She could feel the warmth of his fingers there, the pressure. She picked up her skirts, and they began dancing. It was lovely, like flying, and her body knew every move to make. They danced around and around that empty room, in perfect timing, together. He was laughing down at her, his dark eyes glittering with enjoyment. She felt so beautiful; so poised and alert and ready for anything. She couldn\u0027t remember when she\u0027d had this much fun. The room around her was blurring. She could see only his eyes, and they were making her feel more and more sleepy. She allowed her own eyes to half close, her head to fall back. She sighed. She couldfeel his gaze now, on her lips, on her throat. She smiled to herself and let her eyes close completely. He was supporting her weight now, keeping her from falling down. She felt his lips on the skin of her neck, burning hot as if he had a fever. Then she felt the sting, like the jabs of two needles. It was over quickly, though, and she relaxed to the pleasure of having her blood drawn out. She remembered this feeling, the feeling of floating on a bed of golden light. A delicious languor stole through all her limbs. She felt drowsy, as if it were too much trouble to move. She didn\u0027t want to move anyway; she felt too good. Her fingers were resting on his hair, clasping his head to her. Idly, she threaded them through the soft dark strands. His hair was like silk, warm and alive under her fingers. When she opened her eyes a slit, she saw that it reflected rainbows in the candlelight. Red and blue and purple, just like - just like the feathers... And then everything shattered. There was pain at her throat suddenly, as if her soul was being torn out of her. She was pushing at Damon, clawing at him, trying to force him away. Screams rang in her ears. Damon was fighting her, but it wasn\u0027t Damon; it was a crow. Huge wings beat against her, thrashing in the air. Her eyes were open. She was awake and screaming. The ballroom was gone, and she was in a darkened bedroom. But the nightmare had followed her. Even as she reached for the light, it came at her again, wings thrashing in her face, sharp beak diving for her. Elena struck out at it, one hand flung up to protect her eyes. She was still screaming. She couldn\u0027t get away from it, those terrible wings kept flailing frantically, with a sound like a thousand decks of cards being shuffled at once. The door burst open, and she heard shouts. The warm, heavy body of the crow struck her and her screams went higher. Then someone was pulling her off the bed, and she was standing protected behind Bonnie\u0027s father. He had a broom and he was beating at the bird with it. Bonnie was standing in the doorway. Elena ran into her arms. Bonnie\u0027s father was shouting, and then came the slam of a window. \"It\u0027s out,\" Mr. McCullough said, breathing hard. Mary and Mrs. McCullough were just outside in the hallway, clad in bathrobes. \"You\u0027re hurt,\" Mrs. McCullough said to Elena in amazement. \"The nasty thing\u0027s pecked you.\" \"I\u0027m okay,\" Elena said, brushing at a spot of blood on her face. She was so shaken that her knees were \"How did it getin?\" said Bonnie. Mr. McCullough was inspecting the window. \"You shouldn\u0027t have left this open,\" he said. \"And what did you want to take the locks off for?\" \"I didn\u0027t,\" Elena cried. \"It was unlocked and open when I heard you screaming and came in,\" Bonnie\u0027s father said. \"I don\u0027t know who else could have opened it but you.\" Elena choked back her protests. Hesitantly, cautiously, she moved to the window. He was right; the locks had been unscrewed. And it could have been done only from the inside. \"Maybe you were sleepwalking,\" said Bonnie, leading Elena away from the window as Mr. McCullough began putting the locks back on. \"We\u0027d better get you cleaned up.\" Sleepwalking. Suddenly the entire dream flooded back to Elena. The hall of mirrors, and the ballroom, and Damon. Dancing with Damon. She pulled out of Bonnie\u0027s grasp. \"I\u0027ll do it myself,\" she said, hearing her own voice quaver on the edge of hysteria. \"No - really - I want to.\" She escaped into the bathroom and stood with her back to the locked door, trying to breathe. The last thing she wanted to do was look in a mirror. But at last, slowly, she approached the one over the sink, trembling as she saw the edge of her reflection, moving inch by inch until she was framed in the silvery surface. Her image stared back, ghastly pale, with eyes that looked bruised and frightened. There were deep shadows under them and smears of blood on her face. Slowly, she turned her head slightly and lifted up her hair. She almost cried out loud when she saw what was underneath. Two little wounds, fresh and open on the skin of her neck.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-8.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
