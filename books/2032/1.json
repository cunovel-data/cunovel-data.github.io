Oak leaves swirled among the rows of granite headstones, and the trees lashed their branches together in frenzy. Elena\u0027s hands were cold, her lips and cheeks were numb, but she stood facing the screaming wind directly, shouting into it.\\n\\n \"Damon!\"\\n\\n This weather was a show of his Power, meant to frighten her away. It wouldn\u0027t work. The thought of that same Power being turned against Stefan woke a hot fury inside her that burned against the wind. If Damon had done anything to Stefan, if Damon had hurt him...\\n\\n \"Damn you, answer me!\" she shouted at the oak trees that bordered the graveyard.\\n\\n A dead oak leaf like a withered brown hand skittered up to her foot, but there was no answer. Above, She turned - and gasped.\\n\\n He was just behind her, so close that her clothes brushed his as she turned. At that distance, she should have sensed another human being standing there, should have felt his body warmth or heard him. But Damon, of course, wasn\u0027t human.\\n\\n She reeled back a couple of steps before she could stop herself. Every instinct that had lain quiet while she shouted into the violence of the wind was now begging her to run.\\n\\n She clenched her fists. \"Where\u0027s Stefan?\"\\n\\n A line appeared between Damon\u0027s dark eyebrows. \"Stefan who?\"\\n\\n Elena stepped forward and slapped him.\\n\\n She had no thought of doing it before she did it, and afterward she could scarcely believe what she had done. But it was a good hard slap, with the full force of her body behind it, and it snapped Damon\u0027s head to one side. Her hand stung. She stood, trying to calm her breath, and watched him.\\n\\n He was dressed as she had first seen him, in black. Soft black boots, black jeans, black sweater, and leather jacket. And he looked like Stefan. She didn\u0027t know how she could have missed that before. He had the same dark hair, the same pale skin, the same disturbing good looks. But his hair was straight, not wavy, and his eyes were black as midnight, and his mouth was cruel.\\n\\n He turned his head slowly back to look at her, and she saw blood rising in the cheek she\u0027d slapped.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"I know who you are. I knowwhat you are. You killed Mr. Tanner last night. And now Stefan\u0027s disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"Has he?\"\\n\\n \"You know he has!\"\\n\\n Damon smiled and then turned it off instantly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m warning you; if you\u0027ve hurt him - \"\\n\\n \"Then, what?\" he said. \"What will you do, Elena? Whatcan you do, against me?\"\\n\\n Elena fell silent. For the first time, she realized that the wind had died away. The day had gone deadly quiet around them, as if they stood motionless at the center of some great circle of power. It seemed as if everything, the leaden sky, the oaks and purple beeches, the ground itself, was connected to him, as if he drew Power from all of it. He stood with his head tilted back slightly, his eyes fathomless and full of strange lights.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she whispered, \"but I\u0027ll find something. Believe me.\"\\n\\n \"I do believe you,\" he said, relaxing, looking around the graveyard. Then he turned back and held out a hand to her. \"You\u0027re too good for my brother,\" he said casually.\\n\\n Elena thought of slapping the hand away, but she didn\u0027t want to touch him again. \"Tell me where he is.\"\\n\\n \"Later, possibly - for a price.\" He withdrew his hand, just as Elena realized that on it he wore a ring like Stefan\u0027s: silver and lapis lazuli. Remember that, she thought fiercely. It\u0027s important.\\n\\n \"My brother,\" he went on, \"is a fool. He thinks that because you look like Katherine you\u0027re weak and easily led like her. But he\u0027s wrong. I could feel your anger from the other side of town. I can feel it now, a white light like the desert sun. You have strength, Elena, even as you are. But you could be so much stronger...\"\\n\\n She stared at him, not understanding, not liking the change of subject. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. And what has it got to do with Stefan?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m talking about Power, Elena.\" Suddenly, he stepped close to her, his eyes fixed on hers, his voice soft and urgent. \"You\u0027ve tried everything else, and nothing has satisfied you. You\u0027re the girl who has everything, but there\u0027s always been something just out of your reach, something you need desperately and can\u0027t have. That\u0027s what I\u0027m offering you. Power. Eternal life. And feelings you\u0027ve never felt before.\"\\n\\n Shedid understand then, and bile rose in her throat. She choked on horror and repudiation. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" he whispered. \"Why not try it, Elena? Be honest. Isn\u0027t there a part of you that wants to?\" His dark eyes were full of a heat and intensity that held her transfixed, unable to look away. \"I can waken things inside you that have been sleeping all your life. You\u0027re strong enough to live in the dark, to glory in it. You can become a queen of the shadows. Why not take that Power, Elena? Let me help you take it.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, wrenching her eyes away from his. She wouldn\u0027t look at him, wouldn\u0027t let him do this to her. She wouldn\u0027t let him make her forget... make her forget...\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the ultimate secret, Elena,\" he said. His voice was as caressing as the fingertips that touched her throat. \"You\u0027ll be happy as never before.\"\\n\\n There was something terribly important she must remember. He was using Power to make her forget it, but she wouldn\u0027t let him make her forget...\\n\\n \"And we\u0027ll be together, you and I.\" The cool fingertips stroked the side of her neck, slipping under the collar of her sweater. \"Just the two of us, forever.\"\\n\\n There was a sudden twinge of pain as his fingers brushed two tiny wounds in the flesh of her neck, and her mind cleared.\\n\\n Make her forget...Stefan.\\n\\n That was what he wanted to drive out of her mind. The memory of Stefan, of his green eyes and his smile that always had sadness lurking behind it. But nothing could force Stefan out of her thoughts now, \"I\u0027ve already found what I want,\" she said brutally. \"And who I want to be with forever.\"\\n\\n Blackness welled up in his eyes, a cold rage that swept through the air between them. Looking into those eyes, Elena thought of a cobra about to strike.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you be as stupid as my brother is,\" he said. \"Or I might have to treat you the same way.\"\\n\\n She was frightened now. She couldn\u0027t help it, not with cold pouring into her, chilling her bones. The wind was picking up again, the branches tossing. \"Tell me where he is, Damon.\"\\n\\n \"At this moment? I don\u0027t know. Can\u0027t you stop thinking about him for an instant?\"\\n\\n \"No!\" She shuddered, hair lashing about her face again.\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s your final answer, today? Be very sure you want to play this game with me, Elena. The consequences are nothing to laugh about.\"\\n\\n \"Iam sure.\" She had to stop him before he got to her again. \"And you can\u0027t intimidate me, Damon, or haven\u0027t you noticed? The moment Stefan told me what you were, what you\u0027d done, you lost any power you might have had over me. Ihate you. You disgust me. And there\u0027s nothing you can do to me, not any more.\"\\n\\n His face altered, the sensuousness twisting and freezing, becoming cruel and bitterly hard. He laughed, but this laugh went on and on. \"Nothing?\" he said. \"I can doanything to you, and to the ones you love. You have no idea, Elena, of what I can do. But you\u0027ll learn.\"\\n\\n He stepped back, and the wind cut through Elena like a knife. Her vision seemed to be blurring; it was as if flecks of brightness filled the air in front of her eyes.\\n\\n \"Winter is coming, Elena,\" he said, and his voice was clear and chilling even over the howl of the wind. \"An unforgiving season. Before it comes, you\u0027ll have learned what I can and can\u0027t do. Before winter is here, you\u0027ll have joined me. You\u0027ll be mine.\"\\n\\n The swirling whiteness was blinding her, and she could no longer see the dark bulk of his figure. Now even his voice was fading. She hugged herself with her arms, head bent down, her whole body shaking. She whispered, \"Stefan - \"\\n\\n \"Oh, and one more thing,\" Damon\u0027s voice came back. \"You asked earlier about my brother. Don\u0027t bother looking for him, Elena. I killed him last night.\"\\n\\n Her head jerked up, but there was nothing to see, only the dizzying whiteness, which burned her nose and cheeks and clogged her eyelashes. It was only then, as the fine grains settled on her skin, that she realized what they were: snowflakes.\\n\\n It was snowing on the first of November. Overhead, the sun was gone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-1.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
