{"id":108719,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"The nameis Salvatore. As in savior,\" he said. There was a brief flash of white teeth in the darkness.\\n\\n Elena looked down. The overhang of the roof obscured the balcony, but she could hear shuffling sounds down there. But they were not the sounds of pursuit, and there was no sign that her companion\u0027s words had been overheard. A minute later, she heard the french windows close.\\n\\n \"I thought it was Smith,\" she said, still looking down into the darkness.\\n\\n Damon laughed. It was a terribly engaging laugh, without the bitter edge of Stefan\u0027s. It made her think of the rainbow lights on the crow\u0027s feathers.\\n\\n Nevertheless, she was not fooled. Charming as he seemed, Damon was dangerous almost beyond imagination. That graceful, lounging body was ten times stronger than a human\u0027s. Those lazy dark eyes were adapted to seeing perfectly at night. The long-fingered hand that had pulled her up to the roof could move with impossible quickness. And, most disturbing of all, his mind was the mind of a killer. A predator.\\n\\n She could feel it just beneath his surface. He wasdifferent from a human. He had lived so long by hunting and killing that he\u0027d forgotten any other way. And he enjoyed it, not fighting his nature as Stefan did, but glorying in it. He had no morals and no conscience, and she was trapped here with him in the middle of the night.\\n\\n She settled back on one heel, ready to jump into action at any minute. She ought to be angry with him now, after what he\u0027d done to her in the dream. She was, but there was no point in expressing it. He knew how furious she must be, and he would only laugh at her if she told him.\\n\\n She watched him quietly, intently, waiting for his next move.\\n\\n But he didn\u0027t move. Those hands that could dart as quickly as striking snakes rested motionlessly on his knees. His expression reminded her of the way he\u0027d looked at her once before. The first time they\u0027d met she\u0027d seen the same guarded, reluctant respect in his eyes - except that then there had also been surprise.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to scream at me? Or faint?\" he said, as if offering her the standard options.\\n\\n Elena was still watching him. He was much stronger than she was, and faster, but if she needed to she thought she could get to the edge of the roof before he reached her. It was a thirty foot drop if she missed the balcony, but she might decide to risk it. It all depended on Damon.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t faint,\" she said shortly. \"And why should I scream at you? We were playing a game. I was stupid that night and so I lost. You warned me in the graveyard about the consequences.\"\\n\\n His lips parted in a quick breath and he looked away. \"I may just have to make you my Queen of Shadows,\" he said, and, speaking almost to himself, he continued: \"I\u0027ve had many companions, girls as young as you and women who were the beauties of Europe. Butyou\u0027re the one I want at my side. Ruling, taking what we want when we want it. Feared and worshipped by all the weaker souls. Would that be so bad?\"\\n\\n \"Iam one of the weaker souls,\" Elena said. \"And you and I are enemies, Damon. We can never be anything else.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" He looked at her, and she could feel the power of his mind as it touched hers, like the brush of those long fingers. But there was no dizziness, no feeling of weakness or succumbing. That afternoon she\u0027d had a long soak, as she always did these days, in a hot bath sprinkled with dried vervain.\\n\\n Damon\u0027s eyes flashed with understanding, but he took the setback with good grace. \"What are you doing here?\" he said casually.\\n\\n It was strange, but she felt no need to lie to him. \"Caroline took something that belonged to me. A diary. I came to get it back.\"\\n\\n A new look flickered in the dark eyes. \"Undoubtedly to protect my worthless brother somehow,\" he said, annoyed.\\n\\n \"Stefan isn\u0027t involved in this!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, isn\u0027t he?\" She was afraid he understood more than she meant him to. \"Strange, he always seems to be involved when there\u0027s trouble. Hecreates problems. Now, if he were out of the picture...\"\\n\\n Elena spoke steadily. \"If you hurt Stefan again I\u0027ll make you sorry. I\u0027ll find some way to make you wish you hadn\u0027t, Damon. I mean it.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Well, then, I\u0027ll just have to work onyou , won\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n Elena said nothing. She\u0027d talked herself into a corner, agreeing to play this deadly game of his again. She looked away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to have you in the end, you know,\" he said softly. It was the voice he\u0027d used at the party, when he\u0027d said, \"Easy, easy.\" There was no mockery or malice now; he was simply stating a fact. \"By hook or by crook, as you people say - that\u0027s a nice phrase - you\u0027ll be mine before the next snow flies.\"\\n\\n Elena tried to conceal the chill she felt, but she knew he saw anyway.\\n\\n \"Abusiness proposition?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. You came here to get a diary. But you haven\u0027t got it.\" He indicated her empty hands. \"You failed, didn\u0027t you?\" When Elena made no reply he went on. \"And since you don\u0027t want my brother involved , he can\u0027t help you. But I can. And I will.\"\\n\\n \"You will?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. For a price.\"\\n\\n Elena stared at him. Blood flamed in her face. When she managed to get words out, they would come only in a whisper.\\n\\n \"What - price?\"\\n\\n A smile gleamed out of the darkness. \"A few minutes of your time, Elena. A few drops of your blood. An hour or so spent with me, alone.\"\\n\\n \"You...\" Elena couldn\u0027t find the right word. Every epithet she knew was too mild.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have it anyway, eventually,\" he said in a reasonable tone. \"If you\u0027re honest, you\u0027ll admit that to yourself. Last time wasn\u0027t the last. Why not accept that?\" His voice dropped to a warm, intimate timbre. \"Remember...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather cut my throat,\" she said.\\n\\n \"An intriguing thought. But I can do it so much more enjoyably.\"\\n\\n He was laughing at her. Somehow, on top of everything else today, this was too much. \"You\u0027re disgusting; you know that,\" she said. \"You\u0027re sickening.\" She was shaking now, and she couldn\u0027t breathe. \"I\u0027d die before I\u0027d give in to you. I\u0027d rather - \"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t sure what made her do it. When she was with Damon a sort of instinct took over her. And at that moment, she did feel that she\u0027d rather risk anything than let him win this time. She noticed, with half her mind, that he was sitting back, relaxed, enjoying the turn his game was taking. The other half of her mind was calculating how far the roof overhung the balcony.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather do this,\" she said, and flung herself sideways.\\n\\n She was right; he was off guard and couldn\u0027t move fast enough to stop her. She felt free space below her feet and spinning terror as she realized the balcony was farther back than she\u0027d thought. She was going to miss it.\\n\\n But she hadn\u0027t reckoned on Damon. His hand shot out, not quick enough to keep her on the roof, but keeping her from falling any farther. It was as if her weight was nothing to him. Reflexively, Elena grasped the shingled edge of the roof and tried to get a knee up.\\n\\n \"Let go of me,\" said Elena through her teeth. Someone was going to come out on that balcony at any second, she was sure of it. \"Let go of me.\"\\n\\n \"Here and now?\" Looking into those unfathomable black eyes, she realized he was serious. If she said yes he would drop her.\\n\\n \"It would be a fast way to end things, wouldn\u0027t it?\" she said. Her heart was pounding in fear, but she refused to let him see that.\\n\\n \"But such a waste.\" With one motion, he jerked her to safety. To himself. His arms tightened around her, pressing her to the lean hardness of his body, and suddenly Elena could see nothing. She was enveloped.\\n\\n Then she felt those flat muscles gathering themselves like some great cat\u0027s, and the two of them launched into space.\\n\\n She was falling. She couldn\u0027t help but cling to him as the only solid thing in the rushing world around her.\\n\\n Then he landed, catlike, taking the impact easily.\\n\\n Stefan had done something similar once. But Stefan had not held her this way afterward, bruisingly close, with his lips almost in contact with hers.\\n\\n \"Think about my proposition,\" he said.\\n\\n She could not move or look away. And this time she knew that it was no Power that he was using, but simply the wildfire attraction between them. It was useless to deny it; her body responded to his. She could feel his breath on her lips.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need you for anything,\" she told him.\\n\\n She thought he was going to kiss her then, but he didn\u0027t. Above them there was the sound of french windows opening and an angry voice on the balcony. \"Hey! What\u0027s going on? Is somebody out there?\"\\n\\n \"This time I did you a favor,\" Damon said, very softly, still holding her. \"Next time I\u0027m going to collect.\"\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t have turned her head away. If he\u0027d kissed her then, she would have let him. But suddenly the hardness of his arms melted around her and his face seemed to blur. It was as if the darkness was taking him back into itself. Then black wings caught and beat the air and a huge crow was soaring away.\\n\\n Something, a book or shoe, was hurled after it from the balcony. It missed by a yard.\\n\\n \"Damn birds!\" said Mr. Forbes\u0027s voice from above. \"They must be nesting on the roof.\"\\n\\n Shivering, with her arms locked around her, Elena huddled in the darkness below until he went back inside.\\n\\n She found Meredith and Bonnie crouching by the gate. \"What took you so long?\" Bonnie whispered. \"We thought you were caught!\"\\n\\n \"I almost was. I had to stay until it was safe.\" Elena was so used to lying about Damon that she did it now without conscious effort. \"Let\u0027s go home,\" she whispered. \"There\u0027s nothing more we can do.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" For a moment Damon\u0027s proposition swam in Elena\u0027s mind. But she shook her head to clear it. \"I\u0027ll think of something,\" she said.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t thought of anything by the next day of school. The one encouraging fact was that Caroline didn\u0027t seem to have noticed anything amiss in her room - but that wasall Elena could find to be encouraged about. There was an assembly that morning, at which it was announced that the school board had chosen Elena as the student to represent \"The Spirit of Fell\u0027s Church.\" All through the principal\u0027s speech about it, Caroline\u0027s smile had blazed forth, triumphant and malicious.\\n\\n Elena tried to ignore it. She did her best to ignore the slights and snubs that came even in the wake of the assembly, but it wasn\u0027t easy. It was never easy, and there were days when she thought she would hit someone or just start screaming, but so far she\u0027d managed.\\n\\n That afternoon, waiting for the sixth-period history class to be let out, Elena studied Tyler Smallwood. Since coming back to school, he had not addressed one word to her directly. He\u0027d smiled as nastily as Caroline during the principal\u0027s announcement. Now, as he caught sight of Elena standing alone, he jostled Dick Carter with his elbow.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that there?\" he said. \"A wallflower?\"\\n\\n Stefan, where are you? thought Elena. But she knew the answer to that. Halfway across school, in astronomy class.\\n\\n Dick opened his mouth to say something, but then his expression changed. He was looking beyond Elena, down the hall. Elena turned and saw Vickie.\\n\\n Vickie and Dick had been together before the Homecoming Dance. Elena supposed they still were. But Dick looked uncertain, as if he wasn\u0027t sure what to expect from the girl who was moving toward him.\\n\\n There was something odd about Vickie\u0027s face, about her walk. She was moving as if her feet didn\u0027t touch the floor. Her eyes were dilated and dreamy.\\n\\n \"Hi there,\" Dick said tentatively, and he stepped in front of her. Vickie passed him without a glance and went on to Tyler. Elena watched what happened next with growing uneasiness. It should have been funny, but it wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n It started with Tyler looking somewhat taken aback. Then Vickie put a hand on his chest. Tyler smiled, but there was a forced look about it. Vickie slid her hand under his jacket. Tyler\u0027s smile wavered. Vickie put her other hand on his chest. Tyler looked at Dick.\\n\\n \"Hey, Vickie, lighten up,\" said Dick hastily, but he didn\u0027t move any closer.\\n\\n Vickie slid her two hands upwards, pushing Tyler\u0027s jacket off his shoulders. He tried to shrug it back on without letting go of his books or seeming too concerned. He couldn\u0027t. Vickie\u0027s fingers crept under his shirt.\\n\\n \"Hey, Vickie, leggo. Don\u0027t do that.\" But Dick remained at a safe distance. Tyler shot him an enraged glare and tried to shove Vickie away.\\n\\n A noise had begun. At first it seemed to be at a frequency almost too low for human hearing, but it grew louder and louder. A growl, eerily menacing, that sent ice down Elena\u0027s spine. Tyler was looking pop-eyed with disbelief, and she soon realized why. The sound was coming from Vickie.\\n\\n Then everything happened at once. Tyler was on the ground with Vickie\u0027s teeth snapping inches from his throat. Elena, all quarrels forgotten, was trying to help Dick pull her off. Tyler was howling. The history room door was open and Alaric was shouting.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t hurt her! Be careful! It\u0027s epilepsy, we just need to get her lying down!\"\\n\\n Vickie\u0027s teeth snapped again as he reached a helpful hand into the melee. The slender girl was stronger than all of them together, and they were losing control of her. They weren\u0027t going to be able to hold her much longer. It was with intense relief that Elena heard a familiar voice at her shoulder.\\n\\n \"Vickie, calm down. It\u0027s all right. Just relax now.\\n\\n With Stefan grasping Vickie\u0027s arm and talking to her soothingly, Elena dared to slacken her own grip. And it seemed, at first, that Stefan\u0027s strategy was working. Vickie\u0027s clawing fingers loosened, and they were able to lift her off Tyler. As Stefan kept speaking to her, she went limp and her eyes shut.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good. You\u0027re feeling tired now. It\u0027s all right to go to sleep.\"\\n\\n But then, abruptly, it stopped working, and whatever Power Stefan had been exercising over her was broken. Vickie\u0027s eyes flew open, and they bore no resemblance to the startled fawn\u0027s eyes Elena had seen in the cafeteria. They were blazing with red fury. She snarled at Stefan and burst out fighting with fresh strength.\\n\\n It took five or six of them to hold her down while somebody called the police. Elena stayed where she was, talking to Vickie, sometimes yelling at her, until the police got there. None of it did any good.\\n\\n Then she stepped back and saw the crowd of onlookers for the first time. Bonnie was in the front row, staring open-mouthed. So was Caroline.\\n\\n \"Whathappened !\" said Bonnie as the officials carried Vickie away.\\n\\n Elena, panting gently, pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes. \"She went crazy and tried to undress Tyler.\"\\n\\n Bonnie pursed her lips. \"Well, she\u0027d have to be crazy towant to, wouldn\u0027t she?\" And she threw a smirk over her shoulder directly at Caroline.\\n\\n Elena\u0027s knees were rubbery and her hands were shaking. She felt an arm go around her, and she leaned against Stefan gratefully. Then she looked up at him.\\n\\n \"Epilepsy?\" she said with disbelieving scorn.\\n\\n \"I think class was just dismissed,\" Stefan said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n They walked toward the boarding house in silence, each lost in thought. Elena frowned, and several times glanced over at Stefan, but it wasn\u0027t until they were alone in his room that she spoke.\\n\\n \"Stefan, what is all this? What\u0027s happening to Vickie?\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been wondering. There\u0027s only one explanation I can think of, and it\u0027s that she\u0027s still under attack.\"\\n\\n \"You mean Damon\u0027s still - oh, my God! Oh, Stefan, I should have given her some of the vervain. I should have realized...\"\\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t have made any difference. Believe me.\" She had turned toward the door as if to go after Vickie that minute, but he pulled her gently back. \"Some people are more easily influenced than others, Elena. Vickie\u0027s will was never very strong. It belongs to him, now.\"\\n\\n Slowly, Elena sat down. \"Then there\u0027s nothing anyone can do? But, Stefan, will she become - like you and Damon?\"\\n\\n \"It depends.\" His tone was bleak. \"It\u0027s not just a matter of how much blood she loses. She needshis blood in her veins to make the change complete. Otherwise, she\u0027ll just end up like Mr. Tanner. Drained, used up. Dead.\"\\n\\n Elena took a long breath. There was something else she wanted to ask him about, something she\u0027d wanted to ask him for a long time. \"Stefan, when you spoke to Vickie back there, I thought it was working. You were using your Powers on her, weren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"But then she just went crazy again. What I mean is... Stefan, youare okay, aren\u0027t you? Your Powers have come back?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer. But that was answer enough for her. \"Stefan, why didn\u0027t you tell me? What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n She went around and knelt by him so that he had to look at her.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s taking me a while to recover, that\u0027s all. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n \"Iam worried. Isn\u0027t there anything we can do?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. But his eyes dropped.\\n\\n Comprehension swept through Elena. \"Oh,\" she whispered, sitting back. Then she reached for him again, trying to get hold of his hands. \"Stefan, listen to me - \"\\n\\n \"Elena,no. Don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s dangerous, dangerous for both of us, but especially for you. It could kill\\n\\n \"Only if you lose control,\" she said. \"And you won\u0027t. Kiss me.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Stefan again. He added, less harshly, \"I\u0027ll go out hunting tonight as soon as it\u0027s dark.\"\\n\\n \"Is that the same?\" she said. She knew it wasn\u0027t. It was human blood that gave Power. \"Oh, Stefan, please; don\u0027t you see I want to? Don\u0027tyou want to?\"\\n\\n \"That isn\u0027t fair,\" he said, his eyes tortured. \"You know it isn\u0027t, Elena. You know how much - \" He turned away from her again, his hands clenched into fists.\\n\\n \"Then why not? Stefan, I need...\" She couldn\u0027t finish. She couldn\u0027t explain to him what she needed; it was a need for connection to him, for closeness. She needed to remember what it was like with him, to wipe out the memory of dancing in her dream and of Damon\u0027s arms locked around her. \"I need us to be together again,\" she whispered.\\n\\n Stefan was still turned away, and he shook his head.\\n\\n \"All right,\" Elena whispered, but she felt a wash of grief and fear as defeat seeped into her bones. Most of the fear was for Stefan, who was vulnerable without his Powers, vulnerable enough that he might be hurt by the ordinary citizens of Fell\u0027s Church. But some of it was for herself. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-11.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
