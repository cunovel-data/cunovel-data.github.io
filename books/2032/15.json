{"id":108723,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Elena, you\u0027re being rude!\" Aunt Judith seldom got angry but she was angry now. \"You\u0027re too old for this kind of behavior.\"\n \"It\u0027s not rudeness! You don\u0027t understand - \" \"I understand perfectly. You\u0027re acting just the way you did when Damon came to dinner. Don\u0027t you think a guest deserves a little more consideration?\"\n Frustration flooded over Elena. \"You don\u0027t even know what you\u0027re talking about,\" she said. This was too much. To hear Damon\u0027s words coming from Aunt Judith\u0027s lips... it was unbearable. \"Elena!\" A mottled flush was creeping up Aunt Judith\u0027s cheeks. \"I\u0027mshocked at you! And Ihave to say\n that this childish behavior only started since you\u0027ve been going out with that boy.\" \"Oh, \u0027that boy\u0027.\" Elena glared at Damon.\n \"Oh, really?\" Elena felt as if she were talking to Damon and Aunt Judith at once, and she looked back and forth between the two of them. All the emotions she\u0027d been suppressing for the last days - for the last weeks, for the months since Stefan had come into her life - were surging forward. It was like a great tidal wave inside her, over which she had no control.\n She realized she was shaking. \"Well, that\u0027s too bad because you\u0027re going to have to tolerate it. I am never going to give Stefan up, not for anyone. Certainly not foryou!\" This last was meant for Damon, but Aunt Judith gasped.\n \"That\u0027s enough!\" Robert snapped. He\u0027d appeared with Margaret, and his face was dark. \"Young lady, if this is how that boy encourages you to speak to your aunt - \"\n \"He\u0027s not \u0027that boy\u0027!\" Elena took another step back, so she could face all of them. She was making a spectacle of herself, everyone in the courtyard was looking. But she didn\u0027t care. She had been keeping a lid on her feelings for so long, shoving down all the anxiety and the fear and the anger where it wouldn\u0027t be seen. All the worry about Stefan, all the terror over Damon, all the shame and humiliation she\u0027d suffered at school, she\u0027d buried it deep. But now it was coming back. All of it, all at once, in a maelstrom of impossible violence. Her heart was pounding crazily; her ears rang. She felt that nothing mattered except to hurt the people who stood in front of her, to show them all.\n \"He\u0027s not \u0027that boy\u0027,\" she said again, her voice deadly cold. \"He\u0027s Stefan and he\u0027s all I care about. And I happen to be engaged to him.\"\n \"Oh, don\u0027t be ridiculous!\" Robert thundered. It was the last straw.\n \"Is this ridiculous?\" She held up her hand, the ring toward them. \"We\u0027re going to get married!\"\n \"You arenot going to get married,\" Robert began. Everyone was furious. Damon grabbed her hand and stared at the ring, then turned abruptly and strode away, every step full of barely leashed savagery. Robert was spluttering on in exasperation. Aunt Judith was fuming.\n \"Elena, I absolutely forbid you - \"\n \"You\u0027renot my mother !\" Elena cried. Tears were trying to force themselves out of her eyes. She needed to get away, to be alone, to be with someone who loved her. \"If Stefan asks, tell him I\u0027ll be at the boarding house!\" she added, and broke away through the crowd.\n She half expected Bonnie or Meredith to follow her, but she was glad they didn\u0027t. The parking lot was full of cars but almost empty of people. Most of the families were staying for the afternoon activities. But a battered Ford sedan was parked nearby, and a familiar figure was unlocking the door.\n \"Matt! Are you leaving?\" She made her decision instantly. It was too cold to walk all the way to the boarding house.\n \"Huh? No, I\u0027ve got to help Coach Lyman take the tables down. I was just putting this away.\" He tossed the Outstanding Athlete placard into the front seat. \"Hey, are you okay?\" His eyes widened at the sight of\n \"Yes - no. I will be if I can get out of here. Look, can I take your car? Just for a little while?\"\n \"Well... sure, but... I know, why don\u0027t you let me drive you? I\u0027ll go tell Coach Lyman.\"\n \"No! I just want to be alone... Oh, please don\u0027t ask any questions.\" She almost snatched the keys out of his hand. \"I\u0027ll bring it back soon, I promise. Or Stefan will. If you see Stefan, tell him I\u0027m at the boarding house. And thanks.\" She slammed the door on his protests and revved the engine, pulling out with a clash of gears because she wasn\u0027t used to a stick shift. She left him standing there staring after her.\n She drove without really seeing or hearing anything outside, crying, locked in her own spinning tornado of emotions. She and Stefan would run away... They would elope... They would show everyone. She would never set foot in Fell\u0027s Church again.\n And then Aunt Judith would be sorry. Then Robert would see how wrong he\u0027d been. But Elena would never forgive them. Never.\n As for Elena herself, she didn\u0027t need anybody. She certainly didn\u0027t need stupid old Robert E. Lee, where you could go from being mega-popular to being a social pariah in one day just for loving the wrong person. She didn\u0027t need any family, or any friends, either...\n Slowing down to cruise up the winding driveway of the boarding house, Elena felt her thoughts slow down, too.\n Well... she wasn\u0027t mad at all her friends. Bonnie and Meredith hadn\u0027t done anything. Or Matt. Matt was all right. In fact, she might not need him but his car had come in pretty handy.\n In spite of herself Elena felt a strangled giggle well up in her throat. Poor Matt. People always borrowing his clunking dinosaur of a car. He must think she and Stefan were nuts.\n The giggle let loose a few more tears and she sat and wiped them off, shaking her head. Oh, God, how did things turn out this way? What a day. She should be having a victory celebration because they\u0027d beaten Caroline, and instead she was crying alone in Matt\u0027s car.\n Carolinehad looked pretty damn funny, though. Elena\u0027s body shook gently with slightly hysterical chuckles. Oh, the look on her face. Somebody better have a video of that.\n At last the sobs and giggles both abated and Elena felt a wash of tiredness. She leaned against the steering wheel trying not to think of anything for a while, and then she got out of the car.\n She\u0027d go and wait for Stefan, and then they\u0027d both go back and deal with the mess she\u0027d made. It would take a lot of cleaning up, she thought wearily. Poor Aunt Judith. Elena had yelled at her in front of half the town.\n Why had she let herself get so upset? But her emotions were still close to the surface, as she found when the boarding house door was locked and no one answered the bell.\n Oh, wonderful she thought, her eyes stinging again. Mrs. Flowers had gone off to the Founders\u0027 Day celebration, too. And now Elena had the choice of sitting in the car or standing out here in this windstorm...\n It moaned through the branches of the oak trees, tearing off the remaining leaves and sending them down in showers. The sound was rising steadily now, not just a moan but a howl.\n And there was something else. Something that came not just from the wind, but from the air itself, or the space around the air. A feeling of pressure, of menace, of some unimaginable force. It was gathering power, drawing nearer, closing in.\n Elena spun to face the oak trees.\n There was a stand of them behind the house, and more beyond, blending into the forest. And beyond that were the river and the graveyard.\n Something... was out there. Something... very bad...\n \"No,\" whispered Elena. She couldn\u0027t see it, but she could feel it, like some great shape rearing up to stand over her, blotting out the sky. Shefelt the evil, the hatred, the animal fury.\n Bloodlust. Stefan had used the word, but she hadn\u0027t understood it. Now she felt this bloodlust... focused on her.\n \"No!\"\n Higher and higher, it was towering over her. She could still see nothing, but it was as if great wings unfolded, stretching to touch the horizon on either side. Something with a Power beyond comprehension... and it wanted tokill ...\n \"No!\" She ran for the car just as it stooped and dived for her. Her hands scrabbled at the door handle, and she fumbled frantically with the keys. The wind was screaming, shrieking, tearing at her hair. Gritty ice sprayed into her eyes, blinding her, but then the key turned and she jerked the door open.\n Safe! She slammed the door shut again and brought her fist down on the lock. Then she flung herself across the seat to check the locks on the other side.\n The wind roared with a thousand voices outside. The car began rocking.\n \"Stop it! Damon, stop it!\" Her thin cry was lost in the cacophony. She put her hands out on the dashboard as if to balance the car and it rocked harder, ice pelting against it.\n Then she saw something. The rear window was clouding up, but she could discern the shape through it. It looked like some great bird made of mist or snow, but the outlines were hazy. All she was sure of was that it had huge sweeping wings... and that it was coming for her.\n Get the key in the ignition. Get it in! Now go! Her mind was rapping orders at her. The ancient Ford wheezed and the tires screamed louder than the wind as she took off. And the shape behind her followed, getting larger and larger in the rearview mirror.\n If she hadn\u0027t been skidding and braking already, the tree would have crashed down on her. As it was, the violent impact shook the car like an earthquake missing the front right fender by inches. The tree was a mass of heaving, pitching branches, its trunk blocking the way back to town completely.\n She was trapped. Her only route home cut off. She was alone, there was no escape from this terrible Power...\n Power. That was it; that was the key. \"The stronger your Powers are, the more the rules of the dark bind you.\"\n Running water!\n Throwing the car into reverse, she brought it around and then slammed into forward. The white shape banked and swooped, missing her as narrowly as the tree had, and then she was speeding down Old Creek Road into the worst of the storm.\n It was still after her. Only one thought pounded in Elena\u0027s brain now. She had to cross running water, to leave this thing behind.\n There were more cracks of lightning, and she glimpsed other trees falling, but she swerved around them. It couldn\u0027t be far now. She could see the river flickering past on her left side through the driving ice storm. Then she saw the bridge.\n It was there; she\u0027d made it! A gust threw sleet across the windshield, but with the wipers\u0027 next stroke she saw it fleetingly again. This was it, the turn should be abouthere.\n The car lurched and skidded onto the wooden structure. Elena felt the wheels grip at slick planks and then felt them lock. Desperately, she tried to turn with the skid, but she couldn\u0027t see and there was no room...\n And then she was crashing through the guardrail, the rotted wood of the footbridge giving way under weight it could no longer support. There was a sickening feeling of spinning, dropping, and the car hit the water.\n Elena heard screams, but they didn\u0027t seem to be connected with her. The river welled up around her and everything was noise and confusion and pain. A window shattered as it was struck by debris, and then another. Dark water gushed across her, along with glass like ice. She was engulfed. She couldn\u0027t see; she couldn\u0027t get out.\n And she couldn\u0027t breathe. She was lost in this hellish tumult, and there was no air.She had to breathe. She had to get out of here...\n \"Stefan, help me!\" she screamed.\n But her scream made no sound. Instead, the icy water rushed into her lungs, invading her. She thrashed against it, but it was too strong for her. Her struggles became wilder, more uncoordinated, and then they stopped.\n Bonnie and Meredith were hunting around the perimeter of the school impatiently. They\u0027d seen Stefan go this way, more or less coerced by Tyler and his new friends. They\u0027d started to follow him, but then that business with Elena had started. And then Matt had informed them that she\u0027d taken off. So they\u0027d set out after Stefan again, but nobody was out here. There weren\u0027t even any buildings except one lonely Quonset hut.\n \"And now there\u0027s a storm coming!\" Meredith said. \"Listen to that wind! I think it\u0027s going to rain.\"\n \"Or snow!\" Bonnie shuddered. \"Where did theygo?\"\n \"I don\u0027t care; I just want to get under a roof. Here it comes!\" Meredith gasped as the first sheet of icy rain hit her, and she and Bonnie ran for the nearest shelter - the Quonset hut.\n And it was there that they found Stefan. The door was ajar, and when Bonnie looked in she recoiled.\n \"Tyler\u0027s goon squad!\" she hissed. \"Look out!\"\n Stefan had a semicircle of guys between him and the door. Caroline was in the corner.\n \"He must have it! He took it somehow; I know he did!\" she was saying.\n \"Took what?\" said Meredith, loudly. Everyone turned their way.\n Caroline\u0027s face contorted as she saw them in the doorway and Tyler snarled. \"Get out.\" he said. \"You don\u0027t want to be involved in this.\"\n Meredith ignored him. \"Stefan, can I talk to you?\"\n \"In a minute. Are you going to answer her question? Took what?\" Stefan was concentrating on Tyler, totally focused.\n \"Sure, I\u0027ll answer her question. Right after I answer yours.\" Tyler\u0027s beefy hand thumped into his fist and he stepped forward. \"You\u0027re going to be dog meat, Salvatore.\"\n Several of the tough guys snickered.\n Bonnie opened her mouth to say, \"Let\u0027s getout of here.\" But what she actually said was, \"The bridge.\"\n It was weird enough to make everyone look at her.\n \"What?\" said Stefan.\n \"The bridge,\" said Bonnie again, without meaning to say it. Her eyes bulged, alarmed. She could hear the voice coming from her throat, but she had no control over it. And then she felt her eyes go wider and her mouth drop open and she had her own voice back. \"The bridge, oh, my God, the bridge! That\u0027s where Elena is! Stefan, we\u0027ve got to save her... Oh, hurry!\"\n \"Yes, oh, God... that\u0027s where she\u0027s gone. She\u0027s drowning!Hurry !\" Waves of thick blackness broke over Bonnie. But she couldn\u0027t faint now; they had to get to Elena.\n Stefan and Meredith hesitated one minute, and then Stefan was through the goon squad, brushing them aside like tissue paper. They sprinted through the field toward the parking lot, dragging Bonnie behind. Tyler started after them, but stopped when the full force of the wind hit him.\n \"Why would she go out in this storm?\" Stefan shouted as they sprang into Meredith\u0027s car.\n \"She was upset; Matt said she took off in his car,\" Meredith gasped back in the comparative quiet of the interior. She pulled out fast and turned into the wind, speeding dangerously. \"She said she was going to the boarding house.\"\n \"No, she\u0027s at the bridge! Meredith, drive faster! Oh, God, we\u0027re going to be too late!\" Tears were running down Bonnie\u0027s face.\n Meredith floored it. The car swayed, buffeted by wind and sleet. All through that nightmare ride Bonnie sobbed, her fingers clutching the seat in front of her.\n Stefan\u0027s sharp warning kept Meredith from running into the tree. They piled out and were immediately lashed and punished by the wind.\n \"It\u0027s too big to move! We\u0027ll have to walk,\" Stefan shouted.\n Of course it was too big to move, Bonnie thought, already scrambling through the branches. It was a full-grown oak tree. But once on the other side, the icy gale whipped all thought out of her head.\n Within minutes she was numb, and the road seemed to go on for hours. They tried to run but the wind beat them back. They could scarcely see; if it hadn\u0027t been for Stefan, they would have gone over the riverbank. Bonnie began to weave drunkenly. She was ready to fall to the ground when she heard Stefan shouting up ahead.\n Meredith\u0027s arm around her tightened, and they broke again into a stumbling run. But as they neared the bridge what they saw brought them to a halt.\n \"Oh, my God... Elena!\" screamed Bonnie. Wickery Bridge was a mass of splintered rubble. The guardrail on one side was gone and the planking had given way as if a giant fist had smashed it. Beneath, the dark water churned over a sickening pile of debris. Part of the debris, entirely underwater except the headlights, was Matt\u0027s car.\n Meredith was screaming, too, but she was screaming at Stefan. \"No! You can\u0027t go down there!\"\n He never even glanced back. He dived from the bank, and the water closed over his head.\n Later, Bonnie\u0027s memory of the next hour would be mercifully dim. She remembered waiting for Stefan while the storm raged endlessly on. She remembered that she was almost beyond caring by the time a hunched figure lurched out of the water. She remembered feeling no disappointment, only a vast and yawning grief, as she saw the limp thing Stefan laid out on the road.\n She remembered how he looked as they tried to do something for Elena. Only that wasn\u0027t really Elena lying there, that was a wax doll with Elena\u0027s features. It was nothing that had ever been alive and it certainly wasn\u0027t alive now. Bonnie thought it seemed silly to go on poking and prodding at it like this, trying to get water out of its lungs and so on. Wax dolls didn\u0027t breathe. She remembered Stefan\u0027s face when he finally gave up. When Meredith wrestled with him and yelled at\n him, saying something about over an hour without air, and brain damage. The words filtered in to Bonnie, but their meaning didn\u0027t. She just thought it odd that while Meredith and Stefan were screaming at each other they were both crying.\n Stefan stopped crying after that. He just sat there holding the Elena-doll. Meredith yelled some more, but he didn\u0027t listen to her. He just sat. And Bonnie would never forget his expression.\n And then something seared through Bonnie, bringing her to life, waking her to terror. She clutched at Meredith and stared around for the source. Something bad... something terrible was coming. Was almost here.\n Stefan seemed to feel it, too. He was alert, stiff, like a wolf picking up a scent.\n \"What is it?\" shouted Meredith. \"What\u0027s wrong with you?\"\n \"You\u0027ve got to go!\" Stefan rose, still holding the limp form in his arms. \"Get out of here!\"\n \"What do you mean? We can\u0027t leave you -\n \"Yes, you can! Get out of here! Bonnie, get her out!\"\n No one had ever told Bonnie to take care of someone else before. People were always taking care of her. But now she seized Meredith\u0027s arm and began pulling. Stefan was right. There was nothing they could do for Elena, and if they stayed whatever had gotten her would get them.\n \"Stefan!\" Meredith shouted as she was unaccountably dragged away.\n \"I\u0027ll put her under the trees. The willows, not the oaks,\" he called after them. Why would he tell us that now? Bonnie wondered in some deep part of her mind that was not taken up with fear and the storm.\n The answer was simple, and her mind promptly gave it back to her. Because he wasn\u0027t going to be around to tell them later.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-15.html","bookId":2032,"book":{"id":2032,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Picking up where The Awakening left off, Elena confronts Damon about Stefan\u0027s disappearance.
