We have a few questions for you, if you don’t mind,” Ben said.\\n\\n “Of course.” Olivia looked somewhat surprised.\\n\\n “This has to do with Noelle,” Charlotte supplied, eager to help.\\n\\n “It has more to do with my son than Noelle,” Ben inserted.\\n\\n Charlotte saw that he’d set his spoon aside and didn’t reach for it again. The subject of David had obviously ruined Ben’s appetite. “I urged Mary Jo to file for child support,” he said.\\n\\n “She should do it,” Jack seconded vigorously, an opinion Charlotte strongly agreed with.\\n\\n “Mary Jo knows David’s unemployed. She thinks there’s no point in filing when he isn’t making any money.” Ben turned to Olivia with a questioning look.\\n\\n “Whether he’s currently employed or not doesn’t matter,” Olivia said.\\n\\n “Good.” Ben’s expression was one of relief.\\n\\n Charlotte felt they should review the facts. “Mary Jo’s been taking care of Noelle on her own and it isn’t right. Ben wanted to help her financially, but Mary Jo wouldn’t accept money.” She had to admire the young woman, although her situation must be difficult.\\n\\n “I did include Noelle in my will,” Ben explained. “But I feel it’s David’s responsibility to support his daughter even if he wasn’t married to the child’s mother. As it is, he’s not supporting the child he had with his ex-wife, either.”\\n\\n “Ben told his son how he felt and I’m afraid their talk didn’t go well. Unfortunately, David ran into Mary Jo shortly after meeting with his father.” Charlotte glanced at Ben, wanting his permission before she continued. He nodded.\\n\\n She paused a moment to butter some bread. “It turns out that David saw Mary Jo and Mack McAfee with Noelle down by the waterfront on Saturday afternoon. You remember how lovely the day was, don’t you? Well, Mary Jo said David threatened her again.”\\n\\n “Threatened?” Olivia asked, frowning. “How, exactly?”\\n\\n Ben took over then. “From what Mary Jo could tell us, it seems David implied that if she went after child support, he’d fight her for custody of Noelle. By the way,” he added, “I’ve recently learned that he’s moved to Seattle.”\\n\\n Charlotte noticed that he didn’t say anything about the woman David was living with, the woman who was supporting him. She knew it was a source of great shame to Ben.\\n\\n “I suppose being in Seattle gives him greater access—and makes him more of a threat,” he went on to say.\\n\\n “In these situations, the state virtually always keeps the infant with the mother,” Olivia assured them.\\n\\n “My son has no intention of raising that child. He has another daughter from his marriage that he rarely sees. He has no interest in being a father to either of his children, painful as that is for me to admit.”\\n\\n Charlotte placed her hand over Ben’s, offering him what comfort she could.\\n\\n “In my opinion, Mary Jo should call his bluff.” Olivia spoke in a no-nonsense voice. “The courts don’t take kindly to these types of threats.”\\n\\n “According to Mary Jo, David didn’t even look at the baby once,” Ben said. “In Noelle’s whole life, he’s never held her, never touched her, and to claim now that he’ll fight for custody is just plain ludicrous.”\\n\\n “Especially when he denied even fathering the child,” Charlotte said.\\n\\n “The judge will ask about his involvement with Noelle to this point,” Olivia told them. “That is, if the case ever comes before the court, which I doubt will happen.”\\n\\n Jack didn’t look convinced. “You never know. He might get himself some crackerjack lawyer with a bee in his bonnet about father’s rights.”\\n\\n “True.” Olivia sighed. “My guess is that David’s using intimidation, hoping Mary Jo won’t ask for money from him, especially now that he’s unemployed.”\\n\\n “Well, if she does, I’m afraid David will refuse to pay,” Ben murmured. “Even if he finds another job.”\\n\\n “Since paternity is verified, the state will garnishee David’s unemployment check, presuming that he’s receiving one. He won’t have any choice but to pay child support.”\\n\\n Charlotte knew he wouldn’t like that, and his current girlfriend wouldn’t, either.\\n\\n “What’s the situation between Mack and Mary Jo?” Olivia asked thoughtfully.\\n\\n “You’ve probably heard that they’re sharing a duplex,” Ben answered. “Each living in one half.”\\n\\n “He loves that little baby. Why, Mack’s far more of a father to her than David,” Charlotte put in.\\n\\n “That’s what I figured,” Olivia said. “I saw the three of them at the market on Saturday and they looked just like any young family on an outing.”\\n\\n “I’m sure Mack’s sweet on Mary Jo,” Ben told them.\\n\\n Sweet was such a lovely word, Charlotte mused. Old-fashioned and charming. Anyone could see that Mack and Mary Jo were falling in love.\\n\\n “If I was a betting man, I’d say they’ll end up married.” Jack reached for his third slice of bread.\\n\\n Charlotte passed him the butter, which he took gratefully until Olivia placed a hand on his forearm. Without saying a word, Jack pushed the butter aside and patted his wife’s hand.\\n\\n This exchange took only a few seconds and it made Charlotte smile despite the seriousness of their conversation. A couple of years ago, Jack had suffered a heart attack, and ever since, Olivia had stood guard over his diet. The way she and Jack looked after each other was inspiring.\\n\\n “Has Mary Jo given you any indication that she’ll eventually marry Mack?” Olivia asked her mother and Ben.\\n\\n “Well, no, but like Ben said earlier,” Charlotte replied, “it’s obvious that they’re close.”\\n\\n “If they were to marry, do you believe Mack would want to legally adopt Noelle?”\\n\\n Charlotte didn’t need to think about her response. “I believe he would. He’s crazy about that baby. Noelle and Mary Jo are all he talks about.” To be fair, she hadn’t had a lot of conversations with Mack, but whenever she did, he was full of stories about them. And his mother said the same thing.\\n\\n Ben raised a cautious hand. “I suspect—” He hesitated, then started again. “I suspect that Mack and Mary Jo had some sort of disagreement after seeing David.”\\n\\n “Now, Ben…”\\n\\n He raised his hand again, stopping her. “I know Mary Jo was flustered and upset when she came to see us, but I’m sure it was over more than what happened with David.”\\n\\n Thinking about it, Charlotte had to agree. Mary Jo had been in a real state. She’d needed to get away, she said. She needed to talk to someone. With Mack living right next door, wouldn’t she go to him? Unless she couldn’t….\\n\\n Of course, he might’ve been at the firehouse, but then Charlotte remembered Olivia mentioning that she’d seen Mack and Mary Jo together that same afternoon. So Mary Jo could easily have discussed the matter with him. Instead, she’d come to Ben and her.\\n\\n Charlotte turned to her daughter. “Why are you asking about Mack?” He wasn’t part of the equation. This had to do with David, Mary Jo and Noelle.\\n\\n “The reason I asked about Mack’s feelings toward Mary Jo,” Olivia said, “is because he might want to adopt Noelle if and when he marries Mary Jo. You told me you thought that would be the case.”\\n\\n Oh, yes. She had said that. And it was true.\\n\\n “I just want everyone to be aware of the potential complications.”\\n\\n Ben shrugged. “If I know David, I’d say he’ll do everything within his power to make the adoption as hard as possible. He doesn’t want Noelle himself, but he won’t want anyone else to become her father. It’s unfortunate, but that’s how my son’s mind works.” Ben lowered his head. “Much as I hate to admit this about my own flesh and blood, if David feels he has the upper hand, he’ll use it to his advantage.”\\n\\n “Then I suggest,” Olivia said, “that you take that power away from him now.”\\n\\n “What do we need to do?” Ben asked.\\n\\n “Have Mary Jo file for child support.”\\n\\n “If she will,” Charlotte felt obliged to insert. The girl had been so terrified that David would try to take Noelle away from her.\\n\\n “David will put up a fight, so warn her in advance to be prepared for that. Really, it’s what we want because the next move will be Mary Jo’s. She can then approach him with relinquishment papers.”\\n\\n “What does that entail?” Ben asked. “Is it as straightforward as it sounds?”\\n\\n “Pretty much. If David signs those papers, he relinquishes his rights as Noelle’s father. Then Mack would be free to adopt Noelle,” Olivia explained.\\n\\n Charlotte clasped her hands together. “That would be wonderful!”\\n\\n “And if not Mack, some other man in the future,” Olivia added. “If David wants out of paying child support, this is the way to do it. I can almost guarantee it’ll save Mary Jo untold heartache later on.”\\n\\n Charlotte was more than satisfied. “We need to discuss this with Mary Jo,” she said.\\n\\n “At our earliest opportunity,” Ben concurred.\\n\\n For the first time since David’s last visit, Charlotte noticed that the frown he’d constantly worn had disappeared.\\n\\n Seventeen\\n\\n “You know what Mack’s going to tell us, don’t you?” Corrie said confidently as she finished setting the table for dinner. Mack had asked if he could bring Mary Jo and Noelle over on Friday evening. That was unusual, so Corrie was convinced she knew the purpose of this visit. Their son was going to announce that he’d asked Mary Jo to marry him. They’d planned to drop by for coffee or a drink, but Corrie had invited them all to dinner. After checking with Mary Jo, Mack had confirmed that they’d be available.\\n\\n Roy was in the living room, watching the news, and didn’t answer.\\n\\n “Roy!” Corrie said, so excited she could barely contain herself. “Mack is going to tell us he’s asked Mary Jo to be his wife.”\\n\\n “You’re sure of that?” he asked, glancing briefly away from the screen.\\n\\n “Not one hundred percent. Call it a mother’s intuition, but I know my son, and he’s head over heels about Mary Jo and that baby girl.”\\n\\n Roy shrugged. “Time will tell. Don’t plan the wedding yet.”\\n\\n Corrie set the casserole dish on the table to cool. She’d made one of Mack’s favorite recipes, shepherd’s pie with a mashed-potato base. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/1022-evergreen-place-cedar-cove-10/page-24.html","bookId":1952,"book":{"id":1952,"title":"1022 Evergreen Place (Cedar Cove #10)","description":"Storyline: 1022 Evergreen Place (Cedar Cove #10) \\n 1022 Evergreen Place, Unit B, \\n Cedar Cove, Washington \\n Dear Reader, \\n Guess what?
