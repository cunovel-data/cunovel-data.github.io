There really was a white light. And voices... \"Annie? Annie!\" She gasped as she was swept into a pair of strong arms. \"Annie...\" Navarre\u0027s voice, calling to her, pleading with her to... what? She opened her eyes again and saw his face hovering over her, his deep gray eyes filled with concern. And regret. \"Navarre? Am I dead?\" He shook his head as he brushed a lock of hair from her brow. \"No.\" \"What is it?\" she asked. \"You look so...\" She shrugged, unable to decipher the expression in his eyes. \"How do you feel?\" \"Feel?\" She glanced around, her gaze mesmerized by the glow of the candle, by the colors trapped in the dancing flame, by the blue-gray smoke that spiraled upward. Realizing that it was the candlelight that had blinded her, she frowned, wondering why it seemed so bright, wondering why she had never before noticed how many colors could be seen in a single flame. \"Annie?\" \"I feel fine. A little strange... what happened? Where\u0027s Shaylyn?\" \"She\u0027s dead.\" \"She is?\" Adrianna frowned, searching her mind for some recollection of what had happened. \"She wanted me to kill you...\" Adrianna sat up, her hands moving over Navarre\u0027s chest. \"Are you all right?\" \"Yes. Are you?\" \"Why do you keep asking me that? I\u0027m fine. I...\" Slowly, she raised her hand to her throat. \"She bit me... I cut her with the knife, and she bit me. I was bleeding, dying...\" Her voice rose in panic. \"Navarre, what happened?\" \"You were dying,\" he said, refusing to meet her eyes. \"Bleeding to death. I... Adrianna, forgive me, but I couldn\u0027t let you go. I\u0027ve been alone for so long, and I love you so much. I... I took your blood.\" \"My blood?\" He nodded, hoping she would understand. \"I took your blood, Annie. I drained you to the point of death. And then I gave it back to you.\" \"You took my blood?\" Her eyes widened with comprehension. \"You made me what she was. What you are.\" \"Can you forgive me?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I\u0027ll take care of you, Annie, I swear it. You won\u0027t have to hunt. You won\u0027t have to kill. You can exist off my blood.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I\u0027ve never made another vampire. My blood is very strong, very powerful. When you feel the lust for blood, I\u0027ll give you a little of mine.\" He smiled sadly at her look of revulsion. \"Mixed with wine, it\u0027s not so bad. It will sustain you.\" \"I can\u0027t be a vampire,\" Adrianna exclaimed. \"What will my mother say?\" Navarre\u0027s brow furrowed. \"Annie...\" She felt a bubble of hysterical laughter rise in her throat, and then deflate, like a balloon pricked by a pin. \"I\u0027m a vampire.\" She shook her head. It was incomprehensible. And yet she knew it was true. She could feel the increased power in her limbs. Her senses were alive as never before. She could hear distant sounds, see through the darkness as if it were day. And Navarre was there beside her. She could hear the steady beat of his heart, feel his apprehension, his concern. His love. And then, to her delight, she discovered she could read his thoughts. Forgive me, Annie. I never meant to hurt you. I know it was selfish of me to bring you over without your permission, but I couldn\u0027t let you go. Please, forgive me. I have no excuse, except that I love you. ... I forgive you, Navarre. And I love you, too. With a start, he rose to his feet.Are you reading my mind ? Joy bubbled up inside her.Yes. I can\u0027t seem to help myself. Do you mind ? \"I don\u0027t mind,\" he said, stroking her cheek. \"My heart, my thoughts, my life, they\u0027re all yours, my darling Annie, to do with as you wish. We\u0027re bonded now, by blood.\" \"And by love.\" \"You\u0027re not sorry, then?\" he asked. She thought about it for a moment, then shook her head. \"No.\" She put her arms around his neck and kissed him, hard. She couldn\u0027t be sorry, not when it meant she could spend a lifetime, a hundred lifetimes, with Navarre. She let her fingers curl into the hair at his nape. \"Besides, if I ever decide I want to be mortal, I can always try that recipe I found.\" \"Annie.\" What a wonder she was! He had expected a variety of reactions from her: fear, disgust, regret, hatred. He had not expected acceptance, or humor, and he knew, without doubt, that he could not live without her. \"If you ever decide to try to regain your mortality, we\u0027ll try it together. Now, if you want.\" She smiled up at him. \"Right now, all I want is you. My love, my life.\" He whispered her name as his arms drew her close. She\u0027d never been more beautiful, he thought. And she was his. For now and for always, she was his. Together, they would explore her new world. Together, he thought, sweeping her into his arms. Together. Forever.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunlight-moonlight/page-51.html","bookId":2306,"book":{"id":2306,"title":"Sunlight Moonlight","description":"Storyline: In Sunlight, handsome alien Micah is trapped on Earth after he crash lands and falls in love with beautiful woman, while in Moonlight, the vampire Navarre seeks for a woman brave enough to enter his world.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sunlight-moonlight.jpg","author":"Amanda Ashley","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/sunlight-moonlight.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:43 PM"}}
