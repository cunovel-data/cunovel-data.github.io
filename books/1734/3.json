{"id":69617,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"(with apologies to W. S. gilbert) If you ask me how to shine in the science-fiction line as a pro of luster bright, I say, practice up the lingo of the sciences, by jingo (never mind if not quite right). You must talk of Space and Galaxies and tesseractic fallacies in slick and mystic style, Though the fans won\u0027t understand it, they will all the same demand it with a softly hopeful smile. And all the fans will say, As you walk your spatial way, If that young man indulges in flights through all the Galaxy, Why, what a most imaginative type of man that type of man must be. So success is not a mystery, just brush up on your history, and borrow day by day. Take an Empire that was Roman and you\u0027ll find it is at home in all the starry Milky Way. With a drive that\u0027s hyperspatial, through the parsecs you will race, you\u0027ll find that plotting is a breeze, Copyright \u0026copy; 1954 by Fantasy House, inc. With a tiny bit of cribbin\u0027 from the works of Edward Gibbon and that Greek, Thucydides. And all the fans will say, As you walk your thoughtful way, If that young man involves himself in authentic history, Why, what a very learned kind of high IQ, his high IQ must be. Then eschew all thoughts of passion of a man-and-woman fashion from your hero\u0027s thoughtful mind. He must spend his time on politics, and thinking up his shady tricks, and outside that he\u0027s blind. It\u0027s enough he\u0027s had a mother, other females are a bother, though they\u0027re jeweled and glistery. They will just distract his dreaming and his necessary scheming with that psychohistory. And all the fans will say As you walk your narrow way, If all his yarns restrict themselves to masculinity, Why, what a most particularly pure young man that pure young man must be.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-3.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
