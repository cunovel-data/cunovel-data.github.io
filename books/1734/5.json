{"id":69619,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Come, come,\" said Shapur quite politely, considering that he was a demon. \"You are wasting my time. And your own, too, I might add, since you have only half an hour left.\" And his tail twitched.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not dematerialization?\" asked Isidore Wellby thoughtfully.\\n\\n \"I have already said it is not,\" said Shapur.\\n\\n For the hundredth time, Wellby looked at the unbroken bronze that surrounded him on all sides. The demon had taken unholy pleasure (what other kind indeed?) in pointing out that the floor, ceiling and four walls were featureless, two-foot-thick slabs of bronze, welded seamlessly together.\\n\\n It was the ultimate locked room and Wellby had but another half hour to get out, while the demon watched with an expression of gathering anticipation.\\n\\n It has been ten years previously (to the day, naturally) that Isidore Wellby had signed up.\\n\\n \"We pay you in advance,\" said Shapur persuasively. \"Ten years of anything you want, within reason, and then you\u0027re a demon. You\u0027re one of us, with a new name of demonic potency, and many privileges beside. You\u0027ll hardly know you\u0027re damned. And if you don\u0027t sign, you may end up in the fire, anyway, just in the ordinary course of things. You never know. . . . Here, look at me. I\u0027m not doing too badly. I signed up, had my ten years and here I am. Not bad.\"\\n\\n \"Why so anxious for me to sign then, if I might be damned anyway?\" asked Wellby.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not so easy to recruit hell\u0027s cadre,\" said the demon, with a frank shrug that made the faint odor of sulfur dioxide in the air a trifle stronger. \"Everyone wishes to gamble on ending in Heaven. It\u0027s a poor gamble, but there it is. I think you \u0027re too sensible for that. But meanwhile we have more damned souls than we know what to do with and a growing shortage at the administrative end.\"\\n\\n Wellby, having just left the army and finding himself with nothing much to show for it but a limp and a farewell letter from a girl he somehow still loved, pricked his finger, and signed.\\n\\n Of course, he read the small print first. A certain amount of demonic power would be deposited to his account upon signature in blood. He would not know in detail how one manipulated those powers, or even the nature of all of them, but he would nevertheless find his wishes fulfilled in such a way that they would seem to have come about through perfectly normal mechanisms.\\n\\n Naturally, no wish might be fulfilled which would interfere with the higher aims and purposes of human history. Wellby had raised his eyebrows at that.\\n\\n Shapur coughed. \"A precaution imposed upon us by-uh-Above. You are reasonable. The limitation won\u0027t interfere with you.\"\\n\\n Wellby said, \"There seems to be a catch clause, too.\"\\n\\n \"A kind of one, yes. After all, we have to check your aptitude for the position. It states, as you see, that you will be required to perform a task for us at the conclusion of your ten years, one your demonic powers will make it quite possible for you to do. We can\u0027t tell you the nature of the task now, but you will have ten years to study the nature of your powers. Look upon the whole thing as an entrance qualification.\"\\n\\n \"And if 1 don\u0027t pass the test, what then?\"\\n\\n \"In that case,\" said the demon, \"you will be only an ordinary damned soul after all.\" And because he was a demon, his eyes glowed smokily at the thought and his clawed fingers twitched as though he felt them already deep in the other\u0027s vitals. But he added suavely, \"Come, now, the test will be a simple one. We would rather have you as cadre than as just another chore on our hands.\"\\n\\n Wellby, with sad thoughts of his unattainable loved one, cared little enough at that moment for what would happen after ten years and he signed.\\n\\n Yet the ten years passed quickly enough. Isidore Wellby was always reasonable, as the demon had predicted, and things worked well. Wellby accepted a position and because he was always at the right spot at the right time and always said the right thing to the right man, he was quickly promoted to a position of great authority.\\n\\n Investments he made invariably paid off and, what was more gratifying still, his girl came back to him most sincerely repentant and most satisfactorily adoring.\\n\\n His marriage was a happy one and was blessed with four children, two boys and two girls, all bright and reasonably well behaved. At the end of ten years, he was at the height of his authority, reputation and wealth, while his wife, if anything, had grown more beautiful as she had matured.\\n\\n And ten years (to the day, naturally) after the making of the compact, he woke to find himself, not in his bedroom, but in a horrible bronze chamber of the most appalling solidity, with no company other than an eager demon.\\n\\n \"You have only to get out, and you will be one of us,\" said Shapur. \"It can be done fairly and logically by using your demonic powers, provided you know exactly what it is you\u0027re doing. You should, by now.\"\\n\\n \"My wife and children will be very disturbed at my disappearance,\" said Wellby with the beginning of regrets.\\n\\n \"They will find your dead body,\" said the demon consolingly. \"You will seem to have died of a heart attack and you will have a beautiful funeral. The minister will consign you to Heaven and we will not disillusion him or those who listen to him. Now, come, Wellby, you have till noon.\"\\n\\n Wellby, having unconsciously steeled himself for this moment for ten years, was less panic-stricken than he might have been. He looked about speculatively. \"Is this room perfectly enclosed? No trick openings?\"\\n\\n \"No openings anywhere in the walls, floor or ceiling,\" said the demon, with a professional delight in his handiwork. \"Or at the boundaries of any of those surfaces, for that matter. Are you giving up?\"\\n\\n \"No, no. Just give me time.\"\\n\\n Wellby thought very hard. There seemed no sign of closeness in the room. There was even a feeling of moving air. The air might be entering the room by dematerializing across the walls. Perhaps the demon had entered by dematerialization and perhaps Wellby himself might leave in that manner. He asked.\\n\\n The demon grinned. \"Dematerialization is not one of your powers. Nor did I myself use it in entering.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure now?\"\\n\\n \"The room is my own creation,\" said the demon smugly, \"and especially constructed for you.\"\\n\\n \"And you entered from outside?\"\\n\\n \"I did.\"\\n\\n \"With reasonably demonic powers which I possess, too?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. Come, let us be precise. You cannot move through matter but you can move in any dimension by a mere effort of will. You can move up, down, right, left, obliquely and so on, but you cannot move through matter in any way.\"\\n\\n Wellby kept on thinking, and Shapur kept on pointing out the utter immovable solidity of the bronze walls, floor and ceiling; their unbroken ultimacy.\\n\\n It seemed obvious to Wellby that Shapur, however much he might believe in the necessity for recruiting cadre, was barely restraining his demonic delight at possibly having an ordinary damned soul to amuse himself with.\\n\\n \"At least,\" said Wellby, with a sorrowful attempt at philosophy, \"I\u0027ll have ten happy years to look back on. Surely that\u0027s a consolation, even for a damned soul in hell.\"\\n\\n \"Not at all,\" said the demon. \"Hell would not be hell, if you were allowed consolations. Everything anyone gains on Earth by pacts with the devil, as in your case (or my own, for that matter), is exactly what one might have gained without such a pact if one had worked industriously and in full trust in-uh-Above. That is what makes all such bargains so truly demonic.\" And the demon laughed with a kind of cheerful howl.\\n\\n Wellby said indignantly, \"You mean my wife would have returned to me even if I had never signed your contract.\"\\n\\n \"She might have,\" said Shapur. \"Whatever happens is the will of-uh- Above, you know. We ourselves can do nothing to alter that.\"\\n\\n The chagrin of that moment must have sharpened Wellby\u0027s wits for it was then that he vanished, leaving the room empty, except for a surprised demon. And surprise turned to absolute fury when the demon looked at the contract with Wellby which he had, until that moment, been holding in his hand for final action, one way or the other.\\n\\n It was ten years (to the day, naturally) after Isidore Wellby had signed his pact with Shapur, that the demon entered Wellby\u0027s office and said, most angrily, \"Look here-\"\\n\\n Wellby looked up from his work, astonished. \"Who are you?\"\\n\\n \"You know very well who I am,\" said Shapur.\\n\\n \"Not at all,\" said Wellby.\\n\\n The demon looked sharply at the man. \"I see you are telling the truth, but I can\u0027t make out the details.\" He promptly flooded Wellby\u0027s mind with the events of the last ten years.\\n\\n Wellby said, \"Oh, yes. I can explain, of course, but are you sure we will not be interrupted?\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t be,\" said the demon grimly.\\n\\n \"I sat in that closed bronze room,\" said Wellby, \"and-\"\\n\\n \"Never mind that,\" said the demon hastily. \"I want to know-\"\\n\\n \"Please. Let me tell this my way.\"\\n\\n The demon clamped his jaws and fairly exuded sulfur dioxide till Wellby coughed and looked pained.\\n\\n Wellby said, \"If you\u0027ll move off a bit. Thank you. . . . Now I sat in that closed bronze room and remembered how you kept stressing the absolute\\n\\n unbrokenness of the four walls, the floor and the ceiling. I wondered: why did you specify? What else was there beside walls, floor and ceiling. You had defined a completely enclosed three-dimensional space.\\n\\n \"And that was it: three-dimensional. The room was not closed in the fourth dimension. It did not exist indefinitely in the past. You said you had created it for me. So if one traveled into the past, one would find oneself at a point in time, eventually, when the room did not exist and then one would be out of the room.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s more, you had said I could move in any dimension, and time may certainly be viewed as a dimension. In any case, as soon as I decided to move toward the past, I found myself living backward at a tremendous rate and suddenly there was no bronze around me anywhere.\"\\n\\n Shapur cried in anguish, \"I can guess all that. You couldn\u0027t have escaped any other way. It\u0027s this contract of yours that I\u0027m concerned about. If you\u0027re not an ordinary damned soul, very well, it\u0027s part of the game. But you must be at least one of us, one of the cadre; it\u0027s what you were paid for, and if I don\u0027t deliver you down below, I will be in enormous trouble.\"\\n\\n Wellby shrugged his shoulders. \"I\u0027m sorry for you, of course, but I can\u0027t help you. You must have created the bronze room immediately after I placed my signature on the paper, for when I burst out of the room, I found myself just at the point in time at which I was making the bargain with you. There you were again; there I was; you were pushing the contract toward me, together with a stylus with which I might prick my finger. To be sure, as I had moved back in time, my memory of what was becoming the future faded out, but not, apparently, quite entirely. As you pushed the contract at me, I felt uneasy. I didn\u0027t quite remember the future, but I felt uneasy. So I didn\u0027t sign. I turned you down flat.\"\\n\\n Shapur ground his teeth. \"I might have known. If probability patterns affected demons, I would have shifted with you into this new if-world. As it is, all I can say is that you have lost the ten happy years we paid you with. That is one consolation. And we\u0027ll get you in the end. That is another.\"\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" said Wellby, \"are there consolations in hell? Through the ten years I have now lived, I knew nothing of what I might have obtained. But now that you\u0027ve put the memory of the ten-years-that-might-have-been into my mind, I recall that, in the bronze room, you told me that demonic agreements could give nothing that could not be obtained by industry and trust in Above. I have been industrious and I have trusted.\"\\n\\n Wellby\u0027s eyes fell upon the photograph of his beautiful wife and four beautiful children, then traveled about the tasteful luxuriance of his office. \"And I may even escape hell altogether. That, too, is beyond your power to decide.\"\\n\\n And the demon, with a horrible shriek, vanished forever. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-5.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
