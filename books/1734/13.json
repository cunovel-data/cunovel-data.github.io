{"id":69627,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Margie even wrote about it that night in her diary. On the page headed May 17, 2157, she wrote, \"Today Tommy found a real book!\" It was a very old book. Margie\u0027s grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper. They turned the pages, which were yellow and crinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to-on a screen, you know. And then, when they turned back to the page before, it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time. \"Gee,\" said Tommy, \"what a waste. When you\u0027re through with the book, you just throw it away, I guess. Our television screen must have had a million books on it and it\u0027s good for plenty more. 1 wouldn\u0027t throw it away.\" \"Same with mine,\" said Margie. She was eleven and hadn\u0027t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had. He was thirteen. She said, \"Where did you find it?\" \"In my house.\" He pointed without looking, because he was busy reading. \"In the attic.\" \"What\u0027s it about?\" \"School.\" Margie was scornful. \"School? What\u0027s there to write about school? I hate school.\" Margie always hated school, but now she hated it more than ever. The Reproduction in whole or in part prohibited except by permission of NEA Service, Inc. mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County Inspector. He was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn\u0027t know how to put it together again, but he knew how all right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again, large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked. That wasn\u0027t so bad. The part Margie hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers. She always had to write them out in a punch code they made her leam when she was six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no time. The Inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted Margie\u0027s head. He said to her mother, \"It\u0027s not the little girl\u0027s fault, Mrs. Jones. I think the geography sector was geared a little too quick. Those things happen sometimes. I\u0027ve slowed it up to an average ten-year level. Actually, the over-all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory.\" And he patted Margie\u0027s head again. Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether. They had once taken Tommy\u0027s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely. So she said to Tommy, \"Why would anyone write about school?\" Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes. \"Because it\u0027s not our kind of school, stupid. This is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago.\" He added loftily, pronouncing the word carefully, \"Centuries ago.\" Margie was hurt. \"Well, I don\u0027t know what kind of school they had all that time ago.\" She read the book over his shoulder for a while, then said, \"Anyway, they had a teacher.\" \"Sure they had a teacher, but it wasn\u0027t a regular teacher. It was a man.\" \"A man? How could a man be a teacher?\" \"Well, he just told the boys and girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions.\" \"A man isn\u0027t smart enough.\" \"Sure he is. My father knows as much as my teacher.\" \"He can\u0027t. A man can\u0027t know as much as a teacher.\" \"He knows almost as much, I betcha.\" Margie wasn\u0027t prepared to dispute that. She said, \"I wouldn\u0027t want a strange man in my house to teach me.\" Tommy screamed with laughter. \"You don\u0027t know much, Margie. The teachers didn\u0027t live in the house. They had a special building and all the kids went there.\" \"And all the kids learned the same thing?\" \"Sure, if they were the same age.\" \"But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid has to be taught differently.\" \"Just the same they didn\u0027t do it that way then. If you don\u0027t like it, you don\u0027t have to read the book.\" \"I didn\u0027t say I didn\u0027t like it,\" Margie said quickly. She wanted to read about those funny schools. They weren\u0027t even half-finished when Margie\u0027s mother called, \"Margie! School!\" Margie looked up. \"Not yet, Mamma.\" \"Now!\" said Mrs. Jones. \"And it\u0027s probably time for Tommy, too.\" Margie said to Tommy, \"Can I read the book some more with you after school?\" \"Maybe,\" he said nonchalantly. He walked away whistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm. Margie went into the schoolroom. It was right next to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her. It was always on at the same time every day except Saturday and Sunday, because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours. The screen was lit up, and it said: \"Today\u0027s arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions. Please insert yesterday\u0027s homework in the proper slot.\" Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather\u0027s grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom, going home together at the end of the day. They learned the same things, so they could help one another on the homework and talk about it. And the teachers were people. . . . The mechanical teacher was flashing on the screen: \"When we add the fractions 1/2 and l/\"-\" Margie was thinking about how the kids must have loved it in the old days. She was thinking about the fun they had.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-13.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
