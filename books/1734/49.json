Consider that eclectic clause In Kant\u0027s philosophy that gnaws With ceaseless anti-logic jaws At all outworn and useless saws That stick in modern mutant craws. So here\u0027s your tale (with faint applause). The words above show ample cause.\n b-Gruff\n Dear Ike, I was prepared\n (And, boy, I really cared) To swallow almost anything you wrote.\n But, Ike, you\u0027re just plain shot,\n Your writing\u0027s gone to pot, There\u0027s nothing left but hack and mental bloat.\n Take back this piece of junk;\n It smelled; it reeked; it stunk; Just glancing through it once was deadly rough.\n But Ike, boy, by and by,\n Just try another try. I need some yams and, kid, I love your stuff.\n c-Kindly\n Dear Isaac, friend of mine,\n I thought your tale was fine.\n Just frightful-\n Ly delightful\n And with merits all a-shine.\n It meant a quite full\n Night, full,\n Friend, of tension\n Then relief\n And attended\n With full measure\n Of the pleasure\n Of suspended\n Disbelief.\n It is triteful,\n Scarcely rightful,\n Almost spiteful\n To declare\n That some tiny faults are there.\n Nothing much,\n Perhaps a touch,\n And over such\n You shouldn\u0027t pine.\n So let me say\n Without delay,\n My pal, my friend,\n Your story\u0027s end\n Has left me gay\n And joyfully composed.\n P. S.\n Oh, yes,\n I must confess\n (With some distress)\n Your story is regretfully enclosed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-49.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: \n The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
