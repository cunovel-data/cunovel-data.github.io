{"id":69631,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"(with apologies to W. S. gilbert)\n Plots, helter-skelter, teem within your brain;\n Plots, s.f. plots, devised with joy and gladness; Plots crowd your skull and stubbornly remain,\n Until you\u0027re driven into hopeless madness.\n When you\u0027re with your best girl and your mind\u0027s in a whirl and you don\u0027t\n hear a thing that she\u0027s saying; Or at Symphony Hall you are gone past recall and you can\u0027t tell a note that\n they\u0027re playing; Or you\u0027re driving a car and have not gone too far when you find that you\u0027ve\n sped through a red light, And on top of that, lord! you have sideswiped a Ford, and have broken your\n one working headlight; Or your boss slaps your back (having made some smart crack) and you stare\n at him, stupidly blinking; Then you say something dumb so he\u0027s sure you\u0027re a crumb, and are possibly\n given to drinking.\n When events such as that have been knocking you flat, do not blame supernatural forces; If you write s.f. tales, you\u0027ll be knocked off your rails, just as sure as the stars in their courses.\n For your plot-making mind will stay deaf, dumb and blind to the dull facts of life that will hound you, While the wonders of space have you close in embrace and the glory of star beams surround you.\n You begin with a ship that is caught on a skip into hyperspace en route for\n Castor, And has found to its cost that it seems to be lost in a Galaxy like ours, but\n vaster. You\u0027re a little perplexed as to what may come next and you make up a series\n of creatures Who are villains and liars with such evil desires and with perfectly horrible\n features. Our brave heroes are faced with these hordes and are placed in a terribly\n crucial position, For the enemy\u0027s bound (once our Galaxy\u0027s found) that they\u0027ll beat mankind\n into submission. Now you must make it rough when developing stuff so\u0027s to keep the yarn\n pulsing with tension, So the Earthmen are four (only four and no more) while the numbers of foes\n are past mention.\n Our four heroes are caught and accordingly brought to the sneering, tyrannical leaders. \"Where is Earth?\" they demand, but the men mutely stand with a courage\n that pleases the readers.\n But, now, wait just a bit; let\u0027s see, this isn\u0027t it, since you haven\u0027t provided a\n maiden, Who is both good and pure (yet with sexy allure) and with not many clothes\n overladen. She is part of the crew, and so she\u0027s captured, too, and is ogled by foes who\n are lustful; There\u0027s desire in each eye and there\u0027s good reason why, for of beauty our girl\n has a bustful. Just the same you go fast till this section is passed so the reader won\u0027t raise\n any ruction, When recalling the foe are all reptiles and so have no interest in human\n seduction. Then they truss up the girl and they make the whips swirl just in order to\n break Earthmen\u0027s silence, And so that\u0027s when our men break their handcuffs and then we are treated\n to scenes full of violence. Every hero from Earth is a fighter from birth and his fists are a match for a\n dozen,\n And then just when this spot has been reached in your plot you come to with your mind all a buzzin\u0027.\n You don\u0027t know where you are, or the site of your car, and your tie is askew and you haven\u0027t a clue of the time of the day or of what people say or the fact that they stare at your socks (not a pair) and decide it\u0027s a fad, or else that you\u0027re mad, which is just a surmise from the gleam in your eyes, till at last they conclude from your general mood, you\u0027ll be mad from right now till you\u0027re hoary.\n But the torture is done and it\u0027s now for the fun and the paper that\u0027s white and the words that are right, for you\u0027ve worked up a new s.f. story. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-17.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: \n The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
