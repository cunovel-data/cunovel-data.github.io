{"id":69632,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Jesse Weill looked up from his desk. His old, spare body, his sharp, high-bridged nose, deep-set, shadowy eyes and amazing shock of white hair had trademarked his appearance during the years that Dreams, Inc., had become world-famous.\n He said, \"Is the boy here already, Joe?\"\n Joe Dooley was short and heavy-set. A cigar caressed his moist lower lip. He took it away for a moment and nodded. \"His folks are with him. They\u0027re all scared.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure this is not a false akrm, Joe? I haven\u0027t got much time.\" He looked at his watch. \"Government business at two.\"\n \"This is a sure thing, Mr. Weill.\" Dooley\u0027s face was a study in earnestness. His jowls quivered with persuasive intensity. \"Like I told you, I picked him up playing some kind of basketball game in the schoolyard. You should\u0027ve seen the kid. He stunk. When he had his hands on the ball, his own team had to take it away, and fast, but just the same he had all the stance of a star player. Know what I mean? To me it was a giveaway.\"\n \"Did you talk to him?\"\n \"Well, sure. I stopped him at lunch. You know me.\" Dooley gestured expansively with his cigar and caught the severed ash with his other hand. \"Kid, I said-\"\n \"And he\u0027s dream material?\"\n \"I said, \u0027Kid, I just came from Africa and-\u0027 \"\n \"All right.\" Weill held up the palm of his hand. \"Your word I\u0027ll always take. How you do it I don\u0027t know, but when you say a boy is a potential dreamer, I\u0027ll gamble. Bring him in.\"\n The youngster came in between his parents. Dooley pushed chairs forward and Weill rose to shake hands. He smiled at the youngster in a way that turned the wrinkles of his face into benevolent creases.\n \"You\u0027re Tommy Slutsky?\"\n Tommy nodded wordlessly. He was about ten and a little small for that. His dark hair was plastered down unconvincingly and his face was unrealisti-cally clean.\n Weill said, \"You\u0027re a good boy?\"\n The boy\u0027s mother smiled at once and patted Tommy\u0027s head maternally (a gesture which did not soften the anxious expression on the youngster\u0027s face). She said, \"He\u0027s always a very good boy.\"\n Weill let this dubious statement pass. \"Tell me, Tommy,\" he said, and held out a lollipop which was first hesitated over, then accepted, \"do you ever listen to dreamies?\"\n \"Sometimes,\" said Tommy trebly.\n Mr. Slutsky cleared his throat. He was broad-shouldered and thick-fingered, the type of laboring man who, every once in a while, to the confusion of eugenics, sired a dreamer. \"We rented one or two for the boy. Real old ones.\"\n Weill nodded. He said, \"Did you like them, Tommy?\"\n \"They were sort of silly.\"\n \"You think up better ones for yourself, do you?\"\n The grin that spread over the ten-year-old face had the effect of taking away some of the unreality of the slicked hair and washed face.\n Weill went on gently, \"Would you like to make up a dream for me?\"\n Tommy was instantly embarrassed. \"I guess not.\"\n \"It won\u0027t be hard. It\u0027s very easy. . . . Joe.\"\n Dooley moved a screen out of the way and rolled forward a dream recorder.\n The youngster looked owlishly at it.\n Weill lifted the helmet and brought it close to the boy. \"Do you know what this is?\"\n Tommy shrank away. \"No.\"\n \"It\u0027s a thinker. That\u0027s what we call it because people think into it. You put it on your head and think anything you want.\"\n \"Then what happens?\"\n \"Nothing at all. It feels nice.\"\n \"No,\" said Tommy, \"I guess I\u0027d rather not.\"\n His mother bent hurriedly toward him. \"It won\u0027t hurt, Tommy. You do what the man says.\" There was an unmistakable edge to her voice.\n Tommy stiffened, and looked as though he might cry but he didn\u0027t. Weill put the thinker on him.\n He did it gently and slowly and let it remain there for some thirty seconds before speaking again, to let the boy assure himself it would do no harm, to let him get used to the insinuating touch of the fibrils against the sutures of his skull (penetrating the skin so finely as to be insensible almost), and finally to let him get used to the faint hum of the alternating field vortices.\n Then he said, \"Now would you think for us?\"\n \"About what?\" Only the boy\u0027s nose and mouth showed.\n \"About anything you want. What\u0027s the best thing you would like to do when school is out?\"\n The boy thought a moment and said, with rising inflection, \"Go on a stratojet?\"\n \"Why not? Sure thing. You go on a jet. It\u0027s taking off right now.\" He gestured lightly to Dooley, who threw the freezer into circuit.\n Weill kept the boy only five minutes and then let him and his mother be escorted from the office by Dooley. Tommy looked bewildered but undamaged by the ordeal.\n Weill said to the father, \"Now, Mr. Slutsky, if your boy does well on this test, we\u0027ll be glad to pay you five hundred dollars each year until he finishes high school. In that time, all we\u0027ll ask is that he spend an hour a week some afternoon at our special school.\"\n \"Do I have to sign a paper?\" Slutsky\u0027s voice was a bit hoarse.\n \"Certainly. This is business, Mr. Slutsky.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know. Dreamers are hard to come by, I hear.\"\n \"They are. They are. But your son, Mr. Slutsky, is not a dreamer yet. He might never be. Five hundred dollars a year is a gamble for us. It\u0027s not a gamble for you. When he\u0027s finished high school, it may turn out he\u0027s not a dreamer, yet you\u0027ve lost nothing. You\u0027ve gained maybe four thousand dollars altogether. If he is a dreamer, he\u0027ll make a nice living and you certainly haven\u0027t lost then.\"\n \"He\u0027ll need special training, won\u0027t he?\"\n \"Oh, yes, most intensive. But we don\u0027t have to worry about that till after he\u0027s finished high school. Then, after two years with us, he\u0027ll be developed. Rely on me, Mr. Slutsky.\"\n \"Will you guarantee that special training?\"\n Weill, who had been shoving a paper across the desk at Slutsky, and punching a pen wrong-end-to at him, put the pen down and chuckled. \"A guarantee? No. How can we when we don\u0027t know for sure yet if he\u0027s a real talent? Still, the five hundred a year will stay yours.\"\n Slutsky pondered and shook his head. \"I tell you straight out, Mr. Weill . . . After your man arranged to have us come here, I called Luster-Think. They said they\u0027ll guarantee training.\"\n Weill sighed. \"Mr. Slutsky, I don\u0027t like to talk against a competitor. If they say they\u0027ll guarantee schooling, they\u0027ll do as they say, but they can\u0027t make a boy a dreamer if he hasn\u0027t got it in him, schooling or not. If they\n t^ke a plain boy without the proper talent and put him through a development course, they\u0027ll ruin him. A dreamer he won\u0027t be, I guarantee you. And a normal human being, he won\u0027t be, either. Don\u0027t take the chance of doing it: to your son.\n \"Now Dreams, Inc., will be perfectly honest with you. If he can be a dreamer, we\u0027ll make him one. If not, we\u0027ll give him back to you without having tampered with him and say, \u0027Let him learn a trade.\u0027 He\u0027ll be better aind healthier that way. I tell you, Mr. Slutsky-I have sons and daughters aind grandchildren so I know what I say-I would not allow a child of mine to be pushed into dreaming if he\u0027s not ready for it. Not for a million dlollars.\"\n Slutsky wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and reached for the Pen. \"What does this say?\"\n \"This is just an option. We pay you a hundred dollars in cash right now. No strings attached. We study the boy\u0027s reverie. If we feel it\u0027s worth follow-iing up, we\u0027ll call you in again and make the five-hundred-dollar-a-year deaj. Leave yourself in my hands, Mr. Slutsky, and don\u0027t worry. You won\u0027t be S\u0027orry.\"\n Slutsky signed.\n Weill passed the document through the file slot and handed an envelope t\u0027o Slutsky.\n Five minutes later, alone in the office, he placed the unfreezer over his Qwn head and absorbed the boy\u0027s reverie intently. It was a typically childish (Saydream. First Person was at the controls of the plane, which looked like a Compound of illustrations out of the filmed thrillers that still circulated among those who lacked the time, desire or money for dream cylinders.\n When he removed the unfreezer, he found Dooley looking at him.\n \"Well, Mr. Weill, what do you think?\" said Dooley, with an eager and proprietary air.\n \"Could be, Joe. Could be. He has the overtones and, for a ten-year-old boy without a scrap of training, it\u0027s hopeful. When the plane went through aj cloud, there was a distinct sensation of pillows. Also the smell of clean Sheets, which was an amusing touch. We can go with him a ways, Joe.\"\n \"Good.\"\n \"But I tell you, Joe, what we really need is to catch them still sooner. And svhy not? Someday, Joe, every child will be tested at birth. A difference in tthe brain there positively must be and it should be found. Then we could Separate the dreamers at the very beginning.\"\n \"Hell, Mr. Weill,\" said Dooley, looking hurt. \"What would happen to my jjob, then?\"\n Weill laughed. \"No cause to worry yet, Joe. It won\u0027t happen in our life-ttimes. In mine, certainly not. We\u0027ll be depending on good talent scouts like 5you for many years. You just watch the playgrounds and the streets\"- Mfeill\u0027s gnarled hand dropped to Dooley\u0027s shoulder with a gentle, approving\n pressure-\"and find us a few more Hillarys and Janows and Luster-Think won\u0027t ever catch us. ... Now get out. I want lunch and then I\u0027ll be ready for my two o\u0027clock appointment. The government, Joe, the government.\" And he winked portentously.\n Jesse Weill\u0027s two o\u0027clock appointment was with a young man, apple-cheeked, spectacled, sandy-haired and glowing with the intensity of a man with a mission. He presented his credentials across Weill\u0027s desk and revealed himself to be John J. Byrne, an agent of the Department of Arts and Sciences.\n \"Good afternoon, Mr. Byrne,\" said Weill. \"In what way can I be of service?\"\n \"Are we private here?\" asked the agent. He had an unexpected baritone.\n \"Quite private.\"\n \"Then, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll ask you to absorb this.\" Byrne produced a small and battered cylinder and held it out between thumb and forefinger.\n Weill took it, hefted it, turned it this way and that and said with a denture-revealing smile, \"Not the product of Dreams, Inc., Mr. Byrne.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t think it was,\" said the agent. \"I\u0027d still like you to absorb it. I\u0027d set the automatic cutoff for about a minute, though.\"\n \"That\u0027s all that can be endured?\" Weill pulled the receiver to his desk and placed the cylinder into the unfreeze compartment. He removed it, polished either end of the cylinder with his handkerchief and tried again. \"It doesn\u0027t make good contact,\" he said. \"An amateurish job.\"\n He placed the cushioned unfreeze helmet over his skull and adjusted the temple contacts, then set the automatic cutoff. He leaned back and clasped his hands over his chest and began absorbing.\n His fingers grew rigid and clutched at his jacket. After the cutoff had brought absorption to an end, he removed the unfreezer and looked faintly angry. \"A raw piece,\" he said. \"It\u0027s lucky I\u0027m an old man so that such things no longer bother me.\"\n Byrne said stiffly, \"It\u0027s not the worst we\u0027ve found. And the fad is increasing.\"\n Weill shrugged. \"Pornographic dreamies. It\u0027s a logical development, I suppose.\"\n The government man said, \"Logical or not, it represents a deadly danger for the moral fiber of the nation.\"\n \"The moral fiber,\" said Weill, \"can take a lot of beating. Erotica of one form or another have been circulated all through history.\"\n \"Not like this, sir. A direct mind-to-mind stimulation is much more effective than smoking room stories or filthy pictures. Those must be filtered through the senses and lose some of their effect in that way.\"\n Weill could scarcely argue that point. He said, \"What would you have me do?\" ,\n \"Can you suggest a possible source for this cylinder?\"\n \"Mr. Byrne, I\u0027m not a policeman.\"\n \"No, no, I\u0027m not asking you to do our work for us. The Department is quite capable of conducting its own investigations. Can you help us, I mean, from your own specialized knowledge? You say your company did not put out that filth. Who did?\"\n \"No reputable dream distributor. I\u0027m sure of that. It\u0027s too cheaply made.\"\n \"That could have been done on purpose.\"\n \"And no professional dreamer originated it.\"\n \"Are you sure, Mr. Weill? Couldn\u0027t dreamers do this sort of thing for some small, illegitimate concern for money-or for fun?\"\n \"They could, but not this particular one. No overtones. It\u0027s two-dimensional. Of course, a thing like this doesn\u0027t need overtones.\"\n \"What do you mean, overtones?\"\n Weill laughed gently. \"You are not a dreamie fan?\"\n Byme tried not to look virtuous and did not entirely succeed. \"I prefer music.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s all right, too,\" said Weill tolerantly, \"but it makes it a little harder to explain overtones. Even people who absorb dreamies would not be able to explain if you asked them. Still they\u0027d know a dreamie was no good if the overtones were missing, even if they couldn\u0027t tell you why. Look, when an experienced dreamer goes into reverie, he doesn\u0027t think a story like in the old-fashioned television or book films. It\u0027s a series of little visions. Each one has several meanings. If you studied them carefully, you\u0027d find maybe five or six. While absorbing in the ordinary way, you would never notice, but careful study shows it. Believe me, my psychological staff puts in long hours on just that point. All the overtones, the different meanings, blend together into a mass of guided emotion. Without them, everything would be flat, tasteless.\n \"Now, this morning, I tested a young boy. A ten-year-old with possibilities. A cloud to him isn\u0027t a cloud, it\u0027s a pillow, too. Having the sensations of both, it was more than either. Of course, the boy\u0027s very primitive. But when he\u0027s through with his schooling, he\u0027ll be trained and disciplined. He\u0027ll be subjected to all sorts of sensations. He\u0027ll store up experience. He\u0027ll study and analyze classic dreamies of the past. He\u0027ll learn how to control and direct his thoughts, though, mind you, I have always said that when a good dreamer improvises-\"\n Weill halted abruptly, then proceeded in less impassioned tones, \"I shouldn\u0027t get excited. All I try to bring out now is that every professional dreamer has his own type of overtones which he can\u0027t mask. To an expert it\u0027s like signing his name on the dreamie. And I, Mr. Byrne, know all the signatures. Now that piece of dirt you brought me has no overtones at all. It was done by an ordinary person. A little talent, maybe, but like you and me, he really can\u0027t think.\"\n Byrne reddened a trifle. \"A lot of people can think, Mr. Weill, even if they don\u0027t make dreamies.\"\n \"Oh, tush,\" and Weill wagged his hand in the air. \"Don\u0027t be angry with what an old man says. I don\u0027t mean think as in reason. I mean think as in dream. We all can dream after a fashion, just like we all can run. But can you and I run a mile in four minutes? You and I can talk, but are we Daniel Websters? Now when I think of a steak, I think of the word. Maybe I have a quick picture of a brown steak on a platter. Maybe you have a better pictori-alization of it and you can see the crisp fat and the onions and the baked potato. I don\u0027t know. But a dreamer . . . He sees it and smells it and tastes it and everything about it, with the charcoal and the satisfied feeling in the stomach and the way the knife cuts through it and a hundred other things all at once. Very sensual. Very sensual. You and I can\u0027t do it.\"\n \"Well, then,\" said Byrne, \"no professional dreamer has done this. That\u0027s something anyway.\" He put the cylinder in his inner jacket pocket. \"I hope we\u0027ll have your full cooperation in squelching this sort of thing.\"\n \"Positively, Mr. Byrne. With a whole heart.\"\n \"I hope so.\" Byrne spoke with a consciousness of power. \"It\u0027s not up to me, Mr. Weill, to say what will be done and what won\u0027t be done, but this sort of thing,\" he tapped the cylinder he had brought, \"will make it awfully tempting to impose a really strict censorship on dreamies.\"\n He rose. \"Good day, Mr. Weill.\"\n \"Good day, Mr. Byrne. I\u0027ll hope always for the best.\"\n Francis Belanger burst into Jesse Weill\u0027s office in his usual steaming tizzy, his reddish hair disordered and his face aglow with worry and a mild perspiration. He was brought up sharply by the sight of Weill\u0027s head cradled in the crook of his elbow and bent on the desk until only the glimmer of white hair was visible.\n Belanger swallowed. \"Boss?\"\n Weill\u0027s head lifted. \"It\u0027s you, Frank?\"\n \"What\u0027s the matter, boss? Are you sick?\"\n \"I\u0027m old enough to be sick, but I\u0027m on my feet. Staggering, but on my feet. A government man was here.\"\n \"What did he want?\"\n \"He threatens censorship. He brought a sample of what\u0027s going round. Cheap dreamies for bottle parties.\"\n \"God damn!\" said Belanger feelingly.\n \"The only trouble is that morality makes for good campaign fodder. They\u0027ll be hitting out everywhere. And, to tell the truth, we\u0027re vulnerable, Frank.\"\n \"We are? Our stuff is clean. We play up straight adventure and romance.\"\n Weill thrust out his lower lip and wrinkled his forehead. \"Between us, Frank, we don\u0027t have to make believe. Clean? It depends on how you look at\n it. It\u0027s not for publication, maybe, but you know and I know that every dreamie has its Freudian connotations. You can\u0027t deny it.\"\n \"Sure, if you look for it. If you\u0027re a psychiatrist-\"\n \"If you\u0027re an ordinary person, too. The ordinary observer doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s there and maybe he couldn\u0027t tell a phallic symbol from a mother image even if you pointed it out. Still, his subconscious knows. And it\u0027s the connotations that make many a dreamie click.\"\n \"All right, what\u0027s the government going to do? Clean up the subconscious?\"\n \"It\u0027s a problem. I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re going to do. What we have on our side, and what I\u0027m mainly depending on, is the fact that the public loves its dreamies and won\u0027t give them up. ... Meanwhile, what did you come in for? You want to see me about something, I suppose?\"\n Belanger tossed an object onto Weill\u0027s desk and shoved his shirttail deeper into his trousers.\n Weill broke open the glistening plastic cover and took out the enclosed cylinder. At one end was engraved in a too fancy script in pastel blue \"Along the Himalayan Trail.\" It bore the mark of Luster-Think.\n \"The Competitor\u0027s Product.\" Weill said it with capitals, and his lips twitched. \"It hasn\u0027t been published yet. Where did you get it, Frank?\"\n \"Never mind. I just want you to absorb it.\"\n Weill sighed. \"Today, everyone wants me to absorb dreams. Frank, it\u0027s not dirty?\"\n Belanger said testily, \"It has your Freudian symbols. Narrow crevasses between the mountain peaks. I hope that won\u0027t bother you.\"\n \"I\u0027m an old man. It stopped bothering me years ago, but that other thing was so poorly done, it hurt. ... All right, let\u0027s see what you\u0027ve got here.\"\n Again the recorder. Again the unfreezer over his skull and at the temples. This time, Weill rested back in his chair for fifteen minutes or more, while Francis Belanger went hurriedly through two cigarettes.\n When Weill removed the headpiece and blinked dream out of his eyes, Belanger said, \"Well, what\u0027s your reaction, boss?\"\n Weill corrugated his forehead. \"It\u0027s not for me. It was repetitious. With competition like this, Dreams, Inc., doesn\u0027t have to worry for a while.\"\n \"That\u0027s your mistake, boss. Luster-Think\u0027s going to win with stuff like this. We\u0027ve got to do something.\"\n \"Now, Frank-\"\n \"No, you listen. This is the coming thing.\"\n \"This!\" Weill stared with a half-humorous dubiety at the cylinder. \"It\u0027s amateurish, it\u0027s repetitious. Its overtones are very unsubtle. The snow had a distinct lemon sherbet taste. Who tastes lemon sherbet in snow these days, Frank? In the old days, yes. Twenty years ago, maybe. When Lyman Harri-son first made his Snow Symphonies for sale down south, it was a big thing.\n Sherbet and candy-striped mountaintops and sliding down chocolate-covered cliffs. It\u0027s slapstick, Frank. These days it doesn\u0027t go.\"\n \"Because,\" said Belanger, \"you\u0027re not up with the times, boss. I\u0027ve got to talk to you straight. When you started the dreamie business, when you bought up the basic patents and began putting them out, dreamies were luxury stuff. The market was small and individual. You could afford to turn out specialized dreamies and sell them to people at high prices.\"\n \"I know,\" said Weill, \"and we\u0027ve kept that up. But also we\u0027ve opened a rental business for the masses.\"\n \"Yes, we have and it\u0027s not enough. Our dreamies have subtlety, yes. They can be used over and over again. The tenth time you\u0027re still finding new things, still getting new enjoyment. But how many people are connoisseurs? And another thing. Our stuff is strongly individualized. They\u0027re First Person.\"\n \"Well?\"\n \"Well, Luster-Think is opening dream palaces. They\u0027ve opened one with three hundred booths in Nashville. You walk in, take your seat, put on your unfreezer and get your dream. Everyone in the audience gets the same one.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard of it, Frank, and it\u0027s been done before. It didn\u0027t work the first time and it won\u0027t work now. You want to know why it won\u0027t work? Because, in the first place, dreaming is a private thing. Do you like your neighbor to know what you\u0027re dreaming? In the second place, in a dream palace, the dreams have to start on schedule, don\u0027t they? So the dreamer has to dream not when he wants to but when some palace manager says he should. Finally, a dream one person likes another person doesn\u0027t like. In those three hundred booths, I guarantee you, a hundred fifty people are dissatisfied. And if they\u0027re dissatisfied, they won\u0027t come back.\"\n Slowly, Belanger rolled up his sleeves and opened his collar. \"Boss,\" he said, \"you\u0027re talking through your hat. What\u0027s the use of proving they won\u0027t work? They are working. The word came through today that Luster-Think is breaking ground for a thousand-booth palace in St. Louis. People can get used to public dreaming, if everyone else in the same room is having the same dream. And they can adjust themselves to having it at a given time, as long as it\u0027s cheap and convenient.\n \"Damn it, boss, it\u0027s a social affair. A boy and a girl go to a dream palace and absorb some cheap romantic thing with stereotyped overtones and commonplace situations, but still they come out with stars sprinkling their hair. They\u0027ve had the same dream together. They\u0027ve gone through identical sloppy emotions. They\u0027re in tune, boss. You bet they go back to the dream palace, and all their friends go, too.\" \"And if they don\u0027t like the dream?\"\n \"That\u0027s the point. That\u0027s the nub of the whole thing. They\u0027re bound to like it. If you prepare Hillary specials with wheels within wheels within wheels, with surprise twists on the third-level undertones, with clever shifts\n of significance and all the other things we\u0027re so proud of, why, naturally, it won\u0027t appeal to everyone. Specialized dreamies are for specialized tastes. But Luster-Think is turning out simple jobs in Third Person so both sexes can be hit at once. Like what you\u0027ve just absorbed. Simple, repetitious, commonplace. They\u0027re aiming at the lowest common denominator. No one will love it, maybe, but no one will hate it.\"\n Weill sat silent for a long time and Belanger watched him. Then Weill said, \"Frank, I started on quality and I\u0027m staying there. Maybe you\u0027re right. Maybe dream palaces are the coming thing. If so we\u0027ll open them, but we\u0027ll use good stuff. Maybe Luster-Think underestimates ordinary people. Let\u0027s go slowly and not panic. I have based all my policies on the theory that there\u0027s always a market for quality. Sometimes, my boy, it would surprise you how big a market.\"\n \"Boss-\"\n The sounding of the intercom interrupted Belanger.\n \"What is it, Ruth?\" said Weill.\n The voice of his secretary said, \"It\u0027s Mr. Hillary, sir. He wants to see you right away. He says it\u0027s important.\"\n \"Hillary?\" Weill\u0027s voice registered shock. Then, \"Wait five minutes, Ruth, then send him in.\"\n Weill turned to Belanger. \"Today, Frank, is definitely not one of my good days. A dreamer\u0027s place is in his home with his thinker. And Hillary\u0027s our best dreamer so he especially should be at home. What do you suppose is wrong with him?\"\n Belanger, still brooding over Luster-Think and dream palaces, said shortly, \"Call him in and find out.\"\n \"In one minute. Tell me, how was his last dream? I haven\u0027t tried the one that came in last week.\"\n Belanger came down to earth. He wrinkled his nose. \"Not so good.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"It was ragged. Too jumpy. I don\u0027t mind sharp transitions for the liveliness, you know, but there\u0027s got to be some connection, even if only on a deep level.\"\n \"Is it a total loss?\"\n \"No Hillary dream is a total loss. It took a lot of editing, though. We cut it down quite a bit and spliced in some odd pieces he\u0027d sent us now and then. You know, detached scenes. It\u0027s still not Grade A, but it will pass.\"\n \"You told him about this, Frank?\"\n \"Think I\u0027m crazy, boss? Think I\u0027m going to say a harsh word to a dreamer?\"\n And at that point the door opened and Weill\u0027s comely young secretary smiled Sherman Hillary into the office.\n Sherman Hillary, at the age of thirty-one, could have been recognized as a dreamer by anyone. His eyes, unspectacled, had nevertheless the misty look of one who either needs glasses or who rarely focuses on anything mundane. He was of average height but underweight, with black hair that needed cutting, a narrow chin, a pale skin and a troubled look.\n He muttered, \"Hello, Mr. Weill,\" and half-nodded in hangdog fashion in the direction of Belanger.\n Weill said heartily, \"Sherman, my boy, you look fine. What\u0027s the matter? A dream is cooking only so-so at home? You\u0027re worried about it? ... Sit down, sit down.\"\n The dreamer did, sitting at the edge of the chair and holding his thighs stiffly together as though to be ready for instant obedience to a possible order to stand up once more.\n He said, \"I\u0027ve come to tell you, Mr. Weill, I\u0027m quitting.\"\n \"Quitting?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to dream any more, Mr. Weill.\"\n Weill\u0027s old face looked older now than at any time in the day. \"Why, Sherman?\"\n The dreamer\u0027s lips twisted. He blurted out, \"Because I\u0027m not living, Mr. Weill. Everything passes me by. It wasn\u0027t so bad at first. It was even relaxing. I\u0027d dream evenings, weekends when I felt like, or any other time. And when I felt like I wouldn\u0027t. But now, Mr. Weill, I\u0027m an old pro. You tell me I\u0027m one of the best in the business and the industry looks to me to think up new subtleties and new changes on the old reliables like the flying reveries, and the worm-turning skits.\"\n Weill said, \"And is anyone better than you, Sherman? Your little sequence on leading an orchestra is selling steadily after ten years.\"\n \"All right, Mr. Weill. I\u0027ve done my part. It\u0027s gotten so I don\u0027t go out any more. I neglect my wife. My little girl doesn\u0027t know me. Last week, we went to a dinner party-Sarah made me-and I don\u0027t remember a bit of it. Sarah says I was sitting on the couch all evening just staring at nothing and humming. She said everyone kept looking at me. She cried all night. I\u0027m tired of things like that, Mr. Weill. I want to be a normal person and live in this world. I promised her I\u0027d quit and I will, so it\u0027s good-by, Mr. Weill.\" Hillary stood up and held out his hand awkwardly.\n Weill waved it gently away. \"If you want to quit, Sherman, it\u0027s all right. But do an old man a favor and let me explain something to you.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to change my mind,\" said Hillary.\n \"I\u0027m not going to try to make you. I just want to explain something. I\u0027m an old man and even before you were born I was in this business so I like to talk about it. Humor me, Sherman? Please?\"\n Hillary sat down. His teeth clamped down on his lower lip and he stared sullenly at his fingernails.\n Weill said, \"Do you know what a dreamer is, Sherman? Do you know\n what he means to ordinary people? Do you know what it is to be like me, like Frank Belanger, like your wife, Sarah? To have crippled minds that can\u0027t imagine, that can\u0027t build up thoughts? People like myself, ordinary people, would like to escape just once in a while this life of ours. We can\u0027t. We need help.\n \"In olden times it was books, plays, radio, movies, television. They gave us make-believe, but that wasn\u0027t important. What was important was that for a little while our own imaginations were stimulated. We could think of handsome lovers and beautiful princesses. We could be beautiful, witty, strong, capable, everything we weren\u0027t.\n \"But, always, the passing of the dream from dreamer to absorber was not perfect. It had to be translated into words in one way or another. The best dreamer in the world might not be able to get any of it into words. And the best writer in the world could put only the smallest part of his dreams into words. You understand?\n \"But now, with dream recording, any man can dream. You, Sherman, and a handful of men like you, supply those dreams directly and exactly. It\u0027s straight from your head into ours, full strength. You dream for a hundred million people every time you dream. You dream a hundred million dreams at once. This is a great thing, my boy. You give all those people a glimpse of something they could not have by themselves.\"\n Hillary mumbled, \"I\u0027ve done my share.\" He rose desperately to his feet. \"I\u0027m through. I don\u0027t care what you say. And if you want to sue me for breaking our contract, go ahead and sue. I don\u0027t care.\"\n Weill stood up, too. \"Would I sue you? . . . Ruth,\" he spoke into the intercom, \"bring in our copy of Mr. Hillary\u0027s contract.\"\n He waited. So did Hillary and so did Belanger. Weill smiled faintly and his yellowed fingers drummed softly on his desk.\n His secretary brought in the contract. Weill took it, showed its face to Hillary and said, \"Sherman, my boy, unless you want to be with me, it\u0027s not right you should stay.\"\n Then, before Belanger could make more than the beginning of a horrified gesture to stop him, he tore the contract into four pieces and tossed them down the waste chute. \"That\u0027s all.\"\n Hillary\u0027s hand shot out to seize Weill\u0027s. \"Thanks, Mr. Weill,\" he said earnestly, his voice husky. \"You\u0027ve always treated me very well, and I\u0027m grateful. I\u0027m sorry it had to be like this.\"\n \"It\u0027s all right, my boy. It\u0027s all right.\"\n Half in tears, still muttering thanks, Sherman Hillary left.\n \"For the love of Pete, boss, why did you let him go?\" demanded Belanger distractedly. \"Don\u0027t you see the game? He\u0027ll be going straight to Luster-Think. They\u0027ve bought him off.\"\n Weill raised his hand. \"You\u0027re wrong. You\u0027re quite wrong. I know the boy\n and this would not be his style. Besides,\" he added dryly, \"Ruth is a good secretary and she knows what to bring me when I ask for a dreamer\u0027s contract. What I had was a fake. The real contract is still in the safe, believe me.\n \"Meanwhile, a fine day I\u0027ve had. I had to argue with a father to give me a chance at new talent, with a government man to avoid censorship, with you to keep from adopting fatal policies and now with my best dreamer to keep him from leaving. The father I probably won out over. The government man and you, I don\u0027t know. Maybe yes, maybe no. But about Sherman Hillary, at least, there is no question. The dreamer will be back.\"\n \"How do you know?\"\n Weill smiled at Belanger and crinkled his cheeks into a network of fine lines. \"Frank, my boy, you know how to edit dreamies so you think you know all the tools and machines of the trade. But let me tell you something. The most important tool in the dreamie business is the dreamer himself. He is the one you have to understand most of all, and I understand them.\n \"Listen. When I was a youngster-there were no dreamies then-I knew a fellow who wrote television scripts. He would complain to me bitterly that when someone met him for the first time and found out who he was, they would say: Where do you get those crazy ideas?\n \"They honestly didn\u0027t know. To them it was an impossibility to even think of one of them. So what could my friend say? He used to talk to me about it and tell me: Could I say, I don\u0027t know? When I go to bed, I can\u0027t sleep for ideas dancing in my head. When I shave, I cut myself; when I talk, I lose track of what I\u0027m saying; when I drive, I take my life in my hands. And always because ideas, situations, dialogues are spinning and twisting in my mind. I can\u0027t tell you where I get my ideas. Can you tell me, maybe, your trick of not getting ideas, so I, too, can have a little peace.\n \"You see, Frank, how it is. You can stop work here anytime. So can I. This is our job, not our life. But not Sherman Hillary. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he\u0027ll dream. While he lives, he must think; while he thinks, he must dream. We don\u0027t hold him prisoner, our contract isn\u0027t an iron wall for him. His own skull is his prisoner, Frank. So he\u0027ll be back. What can he do?\" Belanger shrugged. \"If what you say is right, I\u0027m sort of sorry for the guy-\"\n Weill nodded sadly. \"I\u0027m sorry for all of them. Through the years, I\u0027ve found out one thing. It\u0027s their business; making people happy. Other peo-pie.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-18.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: \n The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
