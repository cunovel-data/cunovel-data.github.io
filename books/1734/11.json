{"id":69625,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"There was a stir as of a very polite first-night audience. Only a handful of scientists were present, a sprinkling of high brass, some Congressmen, a few newsmen. Alvin Homer of the Washington Bureau of the Continental Press found himself next to Joseph Vincenzo of Los Alamos, and said, \"Now we ought to leam something.\" Vincenzo stared at him through bifocals and said, \"Not the important thing.\" Homer frowned. This was to be the first super-slow-motion films of an atomic explosion. With trick lenses changing directional polarization in flickers, the moment of explosion would be divided into billionth-second snaps. Yesterday, an A-bomb had exploded. Today, those snaps would show the explosion in incredible detail. Horner said, \"You think this won\u0027t work?\" Vincenzo looked tormented. \"It will work. We\u0027ve run pilot tests. But the important thing-\" \"Which is?\" \"That these bombs are man\u0027s death sentence. We don\u0027t seem to be able to learn that.\" Vincenzo nodded. \"Look at them here. They\u0027re excited and thrilled, but not afraid.\" The newsman said, \"They know the danger. They\u0027re afraid, too.\" \"Not enough,\" said the scientist. \"I\u0027ve seen men watch an H-bomb blow an island into a hole and then go home and sleep. That\u0027s the way men are. For thousands of years, hell-fire has been preached to them, and it\u0027s made no real impression.\" \"Hell-fire: Are you religious, sir?\" \"What you saw yesterday was hell-fire. An exploding atom bomb is hell-fire. Literally.\" That was enough for Homer. He got up and changed his seat, but watched the audience uneasily. Were any afraid? Did any worry about hell-fire? It didn\u0027t seem so to him. The lights went out, the projector started. On the screen, the firing tower stood gaunt. The audience grew tensely quiet. Then a dot of light appeared at the apex of the tower, a brilliant, burning point, slowly budding in a lazy, outward elbowing, this way and that, taking on uneven shapes of light and shadow, growing oval. A man cried out chokingly, then others. A hoarse babble of noise, followed by thick silence. Horner could smell fear, taste terror in his own mouth, feel his blood freeze. The oval fireball had sprouted projections, then paused a moment in stasis, before expanding rapidly into a bright and featureless sphere. That moment of stasis-the fireball had shown dark spots for eyes, with dark lines for thin, flaring eyebrows, a hairline coming down V-shaped, a mouth twisted upward, laughing wildly in the hell-fire-and horns.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-11.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
