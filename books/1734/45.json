You could see she had a delicate hand with the dye, the way they did thirty years ago, before the streaks and stipples came into fashion.\\n\\n She had a sweet smile on her face, too, and a calm look that made something serene out of elderliness.\\n\\n And, by comparison, it made something shrieking out of the confusion that enfolded her in the huge government building.\\n\\n A girl passed her at a half-run, stopped and turned toward her with a blank stare of astonishment. \"How did you get in?\"\\n\\n The woman smiled. \"I\u0027m looking for my son, the physicist.\"\\n\\n \"Your son, the-\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a communications engineer, really. Senior Physicist Gerard Cremona.\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Cremona. Well, he\u0027s- Where\u0027s your pass?\"\\n\\n \"Here it is. I\u0027m his mother.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Mrs. Cremona, I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve got to- His office is down there. You just ask someone.\" She passed on, running.\\n\\n Mrs. Cremona shook her head slowly. Something had happened, she supposed. She hoped Gerard was all right.\\n\\n She heard voices much farther down the corridor and smiled happily. She could tell Gerard\u0027s.\\n\\n She walked into the room and said, \"Hello, Gerard.\"\\n\\n Gerard was a big man, with a lot of hair still and the gray just beginning to show because he didn\u0027t use dye. He said he was too busy. She was very proud of him and the way he looked.\\n\\n Right now, he was talking volubly to a man in army uniform. She couldn\u0027t tell the rank, but she knew Gerard could handle him.\\n\\n Gerard looked up and said, \"What do you- Mother! What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"I was coming to visit you today.\"\\n\\n \"Is today Thursday? Oh Lord, I forgot. Sit down, Mother, I can\u0027t talk now. Any seat. Any seat. Look, General.\"\\n\\n General Reiner looked over his shoulder and one hand slapped against the other in the region of the small of his back. \"Your mother?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Should she be here?\"\\n\\n \"Right now, no, but I\u0027ll vouch for her. She can\u0027t even read a thermometer so nothing of this will mean anything to her. Now look, General. They\u0027re on Pluto. You see? They are. The radio signals can\u0027t be of natural origin so they must originate from human beings, from our men. You\u0027ll have to accept that. Of all the expeditions we\u0027ve sent out beyond the planetoid belt, one turns out to have made it. And they\u0027ve reached Pluto.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I understand what you\u0027re saying, but isn\u0027t it impossible just the same? The men who are on Pluto now were launched four years ago with equipment that could not have kept them alive more than a year. That is my understanding. They were aimed at Ganymede and seem to have gone eight times the proper distance.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. And we\u0027ve got to know how and why. They may-just-have- had-help.\"\\n\\n \"What kind? How?\"\\n\\n Cremona clenched his jaws for a moment as though praying inwardly. \"General,\" he said, \"I\u0027m putting myself out on a limb but it is just barely possible non-humans are involved. Extra-terrestrials. We\u0027ve got to find out. We don\u0027t know how long contact can be maintained.\"\\n\\n \"You mean\" (the General\u0027s grave face twitched into an almost-smile) \"they may have escaped from custody and they may be recaptured again at any time.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe. Maybe. The whole future of the human race may depend on our knowing exactly what we\u0027re up against. Knowing it now.\"\\n\\n \"All right. What is it you want?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to need Army\u0027s Multivac computer at once. Rip out every problem it\u0027s working on and start programing our general semantic problem. Every communications engineer you have must be pulled off anything he\u0027s on and placed into coordination with our own.\"\\n\\n \"But why? I fail to see the connection.\"\\n\\n A gentle voice interrupted. \"General, would you like a piece of fruit? I brought some oranges.\"\\n\\n Cremona said, \"Mother! Please! Later! General, the point is a simple one. At the present moment Pluto is just under four billion miles away. It takes six hours for radio waves, traveling at the speed of light, to reach from here to there. If we say something, we must wait twelve hours for an answer. If they say something and we miss it and say \u0027what\u0027 and they repeat-bang, goes a day.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no way to speed it up?\" said the General.\\n\\n \"Of course not. It\u0027s the fundamental law of communications. No information can be transmitted at more than the speed of light. It will take months to carry on the same conversation with Pluto that would take hours between the two of us right now.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I see that. And you really think extra-terrestrials are involved?\"\\n\\n \"I do. To be honest, not everyone here agrees with me. Still, we\u0027re straining every nerve, every fiber, to devise some method of concentrating communication. We must get in as many bits per second as possible and pray we get what we need before we lose contact. And there\u0027s where I need Multivac and your men. There must be some communications strategy we can use that will reduce the number of signals we need send out. Even an increase of ten percent in efficiency can mean perhaps a week of time saved.\"\\n\\n The gentle voice interrupted again. \"Good grief, Gerard, are you trying to get some talking done?\"\\n\\n \"Mother! Please!\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re going about it the wrong way. Really.\"\\n\\n \"Mother.\" There was a hysterical edge to Cremona\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Well, all right, but if you\u0027re going to say something and then wait twelve hours for an answer, you\u0027re silly. You shouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n The General snorted. \"Dr. Cremona, shall we consult-\"\\n\\n \"Just one moment, General,\" said Cremona. \"What are you getting at, Mother?\"\\n\\n \"While you\u0027re waiting for an answer,\" said Mrs. Cremona, earnestly, \"just keep on transmitting and tell them to do the same. You talk all the time and they talk all the time. You have someone listening all the time and they do, too. If either one of you says anything that needs an answer, you can slip one in at your end, but chances are, you\u0027ll get all you need without asking.\"\\n\\n Both men stared at her.\\n\\n Cremona whispered, \"Of course. Continuous conversation. Just twelve hours out of phase, that\u0027s all. God, we\u0027ve got to get going.\"\\n\\n He strode out of the room, virtually dragging the General with him, then strode back in.\\n\\n \"Mother,\" he said, \"if you\u0027ll excuse me, this will take a few hours, I think. I\u0027ll send in some girls to talk to you. Or take a nap, if you\u0027d rather.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be all right, Gerard,\" said Mrs. Cremona.\\n\\n \"Only, how did you think of this, Mother? What made you suggest this?\"\\n\\n \"But, Gerard, all women know it. Any two women-on the video-phone, or on the stratowire, or just face to face-know that the whole secret to spreading the news is, no matter what, to Just Keep Talking.\"\\n\\n Cremona tried to smile. Then, his lower lip trembling, he turned and left.\\n\\n Mrs. Cremona looked fondly after him. Such a fine man, her son, the physicist. Big as he was and important as he was, he still knew that a boy should always listen to his mother. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-45.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
