{"id":69648,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"In the Great Court, which stands as a patch of untouched peace among the fifty busy square miles devoted to the towering buildings that are the pulse beat of the United Worlds of the Galaxy, stands a statue . . .\n Norman and Liwy were late, naturally, since catching a train is always a matter of last-minute delays, so they had to take the only available seat in the coach. It was the one toward the front; the one with nothing before it but the seat that faced wrong way, with its back hard against the front partition. While Norman heaved the suitcase onto the rack, Liwy found herself chafing a little.\n If a couple took the wrong-way seat before them, they would be staring self-consciously into each others\u0027 faces all the hours it would take to reach New York; or else, which was scarcely better, they would have to erect synthetic barriers of newspaper. Still, there was no use in taking a chance on there being another unoccupied double seat elsewhere in the train.\n Norman didn\u0027t seem to mind, and that was a little disappointing to Liwy. Usually they held their moods in common. That, Norman claimed, was why he remained sure that he had married the right girl.\n He would say, \"We fit each other, Liwy, and that\u0027s the key fact. When you\u0027re doing a jigsaw puzzle and one piece fits another, that\u0027s it. There are no other possibilities, and of course there are no other girls.\"\n And she would laugh and say, \"If you hadn\u0027t been on the streetcar that day, you would probably never have met me. What would you have done then?\"\n \"Stayed a bachelor. Naturally. Besides, I would have met you through Georgette another day.\"\n \"It wouldn\u0027t have been the same.\"\n \"Sure it would.\"\n \"No, it wouldn\u0027t. Besides, Georgette would never have introduced me. She was interested in you herself, and she\u0027s the type who knows better than to create a possible rival.\"\n \"What nonsense.\"\n Livvy asked her favorite question: \"Norman, what if you had been one minute later at the streetcar corner and had taken the next car? What do you suppose would have happened?\"\n \"And what if fish had wings and all of them flew to the top of the mountains? What would we have to eat on Fridays then?\"\n But they had caught the streetcar, and fish didn \u0027t have wings, so that now they had been married five years and ate fish on Fridays. And because they had been married five years, they were going to celebrate by spending a week in New York.\n Then she remembered the present problem. \"I wish we could have found some other seat.\"\n Norman said, \"Sure. So do I. But no one has taken it yet, so we\u0027ll have relative privacy as far as Providence, anyway.\"\n Livvy was unconsoled, and felt herself justified when a plump little man walked down the central aisle of the coach. Now, where had he come from? The train was halfway between Boston and Providence, and if he had had a seat, why hadn\u0027t he kept it? She took out her vanity and considered her reflection. She had a theory that if she ignored the little man, he would pass by. So she concentrated on her light-brown hair which, in the rush of catching the train, had become disarranged just a little; at her blue eyes, and at her little mouth with the plump lips which Norman said looked like a permanent kiss.\n Not bad, she thought.\n Then she looked up, and the little man was in the seat opposite. He caught her eye and grinned widely. A series of lines curled about the edges of his smile. He lifted his hat hastily and put it down beside him on top of the little black box he had been carrying. A circle of white hair instantly sprang up stiffly about the large bald spot that made the center of his skull a desert.\n She could not help smiling back a little, but then she caught sight of the black box again and the smile faded. She yanked at Norman\u0027s elbow.\n Norman looked up from his newspaper. He had startlingly dark eyebrows that almost met above the bridge of his nose, giving him a formidable first appearance. But they and the dark eyes beneath bent upon her now with only the usual look of pleased and somewhat amused affection.\n He said, \"What\u0027s up?\" He did not look at the plump little man opposite.\n Livvy did her best to indicate what she saw by a little unobtrusive gesture of her hand and head. But the little man was watching and she felt a fool, since Norman simply stared at her blankly.\n Finally she pulled him closer and whispered, \"Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s printed on his box?\"\n She looked again as she said it, and there was no mistake. It was not very prominent, but the light caught it slantingly and it was a slightly more glistening area on a black background. In flowing script it said, \"What If.\"\n The little man was smiling again. He nodded his head rapidly and pointed to the words and then to himself several times over.\n Norman said in an aside, \"Must be his name.\"\n Liwy replied, \"Oh, how could that be anybody\u0027s name?\"\n Norman put his paper aside. \"I\u0027ll show you.\" He leaned over and said, \"Mr. If?\"\n The little man looked at him eagerly.\n \"Do you have the time, Mr. If?\"\n The little man took out a large watch from his vest pocket and displayed the dial.\n \"Thank you, Mr. If,\" said Norman. And again in a whisper, \"See, Liwy.\"\n He would have returned to his paper, but the little man was opening his box and raising a finger periodically as he did so, to enforce their attention. It was just a slab of frosted glass that he removed-about six by nine inches in length and width and perhaps an inch thick. It had beveled edges, rounded corners, and was completely featureless. Then he took out a little wire stand on which the glass slab fitted comfortably. He rested the combination on his knees and looked proudly at them.\n Liwy said, with sudden excitement, \"Heavens, Norman, it\u0027s a picture of some sort.\"\n Norman bent close. Then he looked at the little man. \"What\u0027s this? A new kind of television?\"\n The little man shook his head, and Liwy said, \"No, Norman, it\u0027s us.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Don\u0027t you see? That\u0027s the streetcar we met on. There you are in the back seat wearing that old fedora I threw away three years ago. And that\u0027s Georgette and myself getting on. The fat lady\u0027s in the way. Now! Can\u0027t you see us?\"\n He muttered, \"It\u0027s some sort of illusion.\"\n \"But you see it too, don\u0027t you? That\u0027s why he calls this \u0027What If.\u0027 It will show us what if. What if the streetcar hadn\u0027t swerved . . .\"\n She was sure of it. She was very excited and very sure of it. As she looked at the picture in the glass slab, the late afternoon sunshine grew dimmer and the inchoate chatter of the passengers around and behind them began fading.\n How she remembered that day. Norman knew Georgette and had been about to surrender his seat to her when the car swerved and threw Liwy into his lap. It was such a ridiculously corny situation, but it had worked. She had been so embarrassed that he was forced first into gallantry and then\n into conversation. An introduction from Georgette was not even necessary. By the time they got off the streetcar, he knew where she worked.\n She could still remember Georgette glowering at her, sulkily forcing a smile when they themselves separated. Georgette said, \"Norman seems to like you.\"\n Livvy replied, \"Oh, don\u0027t be silly! He was just being polite. But he is nice-looking, isn\u0027t he?\"\n It was only six months after that that they married.\n And now here was that same streetcar again, with Norman and herself and Georgette. As she thought that, the smooth train noises, the rapid clack-clack of the wheels, vanished completely. Instead, she was in the swaying confines of the streetcar. She had just boarded it with Georgette at the previous stop.\n Liwy shifted weight with the swaying of the streetcar, as did forty others, sitting and standing, all to the same monotonous and rather ridiculous rhythm. She said, \"Somebody\u0027s motioning at you, Georgette. Do you know him?\"\n \"At me?\" Georgette directed a deliberately casual glance over her shoulder. Her artificially long eyelashes flickered. She said, \"I know him a little. What do you suppose he wants?\"\n \"Let\u0027s find out,\" said Livvy. She felt pleased and a little wicked.\n Georgette had a well-known habit of hoarding her male acquaintances, and it was rather fun to annoy her this way. And besides, this one seemed quite . . . interesting.\n She snaked past the line of standees, and Georgette followed without enthusiasm. It was just as Livvy arrived opposite the young man\u0027s seat that the streetcar lurched heavily as it rounded a curve. Liwy snatched desperately in the direction of the straps. Her fingertips caught and she held on. It was a long moment before she could breathe. For some reason, it had seemed that there were no straps close enough to be reached. Somehow, she felt that by all the laws of nature she should have fallen.\n The young man did not look at her. He was smiling at Georgette and rising from his seat. He had astonishing eyebrows that gave him a rather competent and self-confident appearance. Liwy decided that she definitely liked him.\n Georgette was saying, \"Oh no, don\u0027t bother. We\u0027re getting off in about two stops.\"\n They did. Livvy said, \"I thought we were going to Sach\u0027s.\"\n \"We are. There\u0027s just something I remember having to attend to here. It won\u0027t take but a minute.\"\n \"Next stop, Providence!\" the loud-speakers were blaring. The train was slowing and the world of the past had shrunk itself into the glass slab once more. The little man was still smiling at them.\n Liwy turned to Norman. She felt a little frightened. \"Were you through all that, too?\"\n He said, \"What happened to the time? We can\u0027t be reaching Providence yet?\" He looked at his watch. \"I guess we are.\" Then, to Liwy, \"You didn\u0027t fall that time.\"\n \"Then you did see it?\" She frowned. \"Now, that\u0027s like Georgette. I\u0027m sure there was no reason to get off the streetcar except to prevent my meeting you. How long had you known Georgette before then, Norman?\"\n \"Not very long. Just enough to be able to recognize her at sight and to feel that I ought to offer her my seat.\"\n Liwy curled her lip.\n Norman grinned, \"You can\u0027t be jealous of a might-have-been, kid. Besides, what difference would it have made? I\u0027d have been sufficiently interested in you to work out a way of meeting you.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t even look at me.\"\n \"I hardly had the chance.\"\n \"Then how would you have met me?\"\n \"Some way. I don\u0027t know how. But you\u0027ll admit this is a rather foolish argument we\u0027re having.\"\n They were leaving Providence. Liwy felt a trouble in her mind. The little man had been following their whispered conversation, with only the loss of his smile to show that he understood. She said to him, \"Can you show us more?\"\n Norman interrupted, \"Wait now, Liwy. What are you going to try to do?\"\n She said, \"I want to see our wedding day. What it would have been if I had caught the strap.\"\n Norman was visibly annoyed. \"Now, that\u0027s not fair. We might not have been married on the same day, you know.\"\n But she said, \"Can you show it to me, Mr. If?\" and the little man nodded.\n The slab of glass was coming alive again, glowing a little. Then the light collected and condensed into figures. A tiny sound of organ music was in Liwy\u0027s ears without there actually being sound.\n Norman said with relief, \"Well, there I am. That\u0027s our wedding. Are you satisfied?\"\n The train sounds were disappearing again, and the last thing Liwy heard was her own voice saying, \"Yes, there you are. But where am I?\"\n Liwy was well back in the pews. For a while she had not expected to attend at all. In the past months she had drifted further and further away from Georgette, without quite knowing why. She had heard of her engagement only through a mutual friend, and, of course, it was to Norman. She remembered very clearly that day, six months before, when she had first\n seen him on the streetcar. It was the time Georgette had so quickly snatched her out of sight. She had met him since on several occasions, but each time Georgette was with him, standing between.\n Well, she had no cause for resentment; the man was certainly none of hers. Georgette, she thought, looked more beautiful than she really was. And he was very handsome indeed.\n She felt sad and rather empty, as though something had gone wrong- something that she could not quite outline in her mind. Georgette had moved up the aisle without seeming to see her, but earlier she had caught his eyes and smiled at him. Liwy thought he had smiled in return.\n She heard the words distantly as they drifted back to her, \"I now pronounce you-\"\n The noise of the train was back. A woman swayed down the aisle, herding a little boy back to their seats. There were intermittent bursts of girlish laughter from a set of four teenage girls halfway down the coach. A conductor hurried past on some mysterious errand.\n Liwy was frozenly aware of it all.\n She sat there, staring straight ahead, while the trees outside blended into a fuzzy, furious green and the telephone poles galloped past.\n She said, \"It was she you married.\"\n He stared at her for a moment and then one side of his mouth quirked a little. He said lightly, \"I didn\u0027t really, Olivia. You\u0027re still my wife, you know. Just think about it for a few minutes.\"\n She turned to him. \"Yes, you married me-because I fell in your lap. If I hadn\u0027t, you would have married Georgette. If she hadn\u0027t wanted you, you would have married someone else. You would have married anybody. So much for your jigsaw-puzzle pieces.\"\n Norman said very slowly, \"Well-I\u0027ll-be-darned!\" He put both hands to his head and smoothed down the straight hair over his ears where it had a tendency to tuft up. For the moment it gave him the appearance of trying to hold his head together. He said, \"Now, look here, Liwy, you\u0027re making a silly fuss over a stupid magician\u0027s trick. You can\u0027t blame me for something I haven\u0027t done.\"\n \"You would have done it.\"\n \"How do you know?\"\n \"You\u0027ve seen it.\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen a ridiculous piece of-of hypnotism, I suppose.\" His voice suddenly raised itself into anger. He turned to the little man opposite. \"Off with you, Mr. If, or whatever your name is. Get out of here. We don\u0027t want you. Get out before I throw your little trick out the window and you after it.\"\n Liwy yanked at his elbow. \"Stop it. Stop it! You\u0027re in a crowded train.\"\n The little man shrank back into the comer of the seat as far as he could\n go and held his little black bag behind him. Norman looked at him, then at Liwy, then at the elderly lady across the way who was regarding him with patent disapproval.\n He turned pink and bit back a pungent remark. They rode in frozen silence to and through New London.\n Fifteen minutes past New London, Norman said, \"Liwy!\"\n She said nothing. She was looking out the window but saw nothing but the glass.\n He said again, \"Liwy! Liwy! Answer me!\"\n She said dully, \"What do you want?\"\n He said, \"Look, this is all nonsense. I don\u0027t know how the fellow does it, but even granting it\u0027s legitimate, you\u0027re not being fair. Why stop where you did? Suppose I had married Georgette, do you suppose you would have stayed single? For all I know, you were already married at the time of my supposed wedding. Maybe that\u0027s why I married Georgette.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t married.\"\n \"How do you know?\"\n \"I would have been able to tell. I knew what my own thoughts were.\"\n \"Then you would have been married within the next year.\"\n Liwy grew angrier. The fact that a sane remnant within her clamored at the unreason of her anger did not soothe her. It irritated her further, instead. She said, \"And if I did, it would be no business of yours, certainly.\"\n \"Of course it wouldn\u0027t. But it would make the point that in the world of reality we can\u0027t be held responsible for the \u0027what ifs.\u0027 \"\n Liwy\u0027s nostrils flared. She said nothing.\n Norman said, \"Look! You remember the big New Year\u0027s celebration at Winnie\u0027s place year before last?\"\n \"I certainly do. You spilled a keg of alcohol all over me.\"\n \"That\u0027s beside the point, and besides, it was only a cocktail shaker\u0027s worth. What I\u0027m trying to say is that Winnie is just about your best friend and had been long before you married me.\"\n \"What of it?\"\n \"Georgette was a good friend of hers too, wasn\u0027t she?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"All right, then. You and Georgette would have gone to the party regardless of which one of you I had married. I would have had nothing to do with it. Let him show us the party as it would have been if I had married Georgette, and I\u0027ll bet you\u0027d be there with either your fiance or your husband.\"\n Liwy hesitated. She felt honestly afraid of just that.\n He said, \"Are you afraid to take the chance?\"\n And that, of course, decided her. She turned on him furiously. \"No, I\u0027m not! And I hope I am married. There\u0027s no reason I should pine for you. What\u0027s more, I\u0027d like to see what happens when you spill the shaker all over\n Georgette. She\u0027ll fill both your ears for you, and in public, too. I know her. Maybe you\u0027ll see a certain difference in the jigsaw pieces then.\" She faced forward and crossed her arms angrily and firmly across her chest.\n Norman looked across at the little man, but there was no need to say anything. The glass slab was on his lap already. The sun slanted in from the west, and the white foam of hair that topped his head was edged with pink.\n Norman said tensely, \"Ready?\"\n Liwy nodded and let the noise of the train slide away again.\n Liwy stood, a little flushed with recent cold, in the doorway. She had just removed her coat, with its sprinkling of snow, and her bare arms were still rebelling at the touch of open air.\n She answered the shouts that greeted her with \"Happy New Years\" of her own, raising her voice to make herself heard over the squealing of the radio. Georgette\u0027s shrill tones were almost the first thing she heard upon entering, and now she steered toward her. She hadn\u0027t seen Georgette, or Norman, in weeks.\n Georgette lifted an eyebrow, a mannerism she had lately cultivated, and said, \"Isn\u0027t anyone with you, Olivia?\" Her eyes swept the immediate surroundings and then returned to Liwy.\n Liwy said indifferently, \"I think Dick will be around later. There was something or other he had to do first.\" She felt as indifferent as she sounded.\n Georgette smiled tightly. \"Well, Norman\u0027s here. That ought to keep you from being lonely, dear. At least, it\u0027s turned out that way before.\"\n And as she said so, Norman sauntered in from the kitchen. He had a cocktail shaker in his hand, and the rattling of ice cubes castanetted his words. \"Line up, you rioting revelers, and get a mixture that will really revel your riots- Why, Liwy!\"\n He walked toward her, grinning his welcome, \"Where\"ve you been keeping yourself? I haven\u0027t seen you in twenty years, seems like. What\u0027s the matter? Doesn\u0027t Dick want anyone else to see you?\"\n \"Fill my glass, Norman,\" said Georgette sharply.\n \"Right away,\" he said, not looking at her. \"Do you want one too, Liwy? I\u0027ll get you a glass.\" He turned, and everything happened at once.\n Liwy cried, \"Watch out!\" She saw it coming, even had a vague feeling that all this had happened before, but it played itself out inexorably. His heel caught the edge of the carpet; he lurched, tried to right himself, and lost the cocktail shaker. It seemed to jump out of his hands, and a pint of ice-cold liquor drenched Liwy from shoulder to hem.\n She stood there, gasping. The noises muted about her, and for a few intolerable moments she made futile brushing gestures at her gown, while Norman kept repeating, \"Damnation!\" in rising tones.\n Georgette said coolly, \"It\u0027s too bad, Liwy. Just one of those things. I imagine the dress can\u0027t be very expensive.\"\n Liwy turned and ran. She was in the bedroom, which was at least empty and relatively quiet. By the light of the fringe-shaded lamp on the dresser, she poked among the coats on the bed, looking for her own.\n Norman had come in behind her. \"Look, Liwy, don\u0027t pay any attention to what she said. I\u0027m really devilishly sorry. I\u0027ll pay-\"\n \"That\u0027s all right. It wasn\u0027t your fault.\" She blinked rapidly and didn\u0027t look at him. \"I\u0027ll just go home and change.\"\n \"Are you coming back?\" ?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Look, Liwy . . .\" His warm fingers were on her shoulders-\n Liwy felt a queer tearing sensation deep inside her, as though she were ripping away from clinging cobwebs and-\n -and the train noises were back.\n Something did go wrong with the time when she was in there-in the slab. It was deep twilight now. The train lights were on. But it didn\u0027t matter. She seemed to be recovering from the wrench inside her.\n Norman was rubbing his eyes with thumb and forefinger. \"What happened?\"\n Liwy said, \"It just ended. Suddenly.\"\n Norman said uneasily, \"You know, we\u0027ll be putting into New Haven soon.\" He looked at his watch and shook his head.\n Liwy said wonderingly, \"You spilled it on me.\"\n \"Well, so I did in real life.\"\n \"But in real life I was your wife. You ought to have spilled it on Georgette this time. Isn\u0027t that queer?\" But she was thinking of Norman pursuing her; his hands on her shoulders. . . .\n She looked up at him and said with warm satisfaction, \"I wasn\u0027t married.\"\n \"No, you weren\u0027t. But was that Dick Reinhardt you were going around with?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t planning to marry him, were you, Liwy?\"\n \"Jealous, Norman?\"\n Norman looked confused. \"Of that? Of a slab of glass? Of course not.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I would have married him.\"\n Norman said, \"You know, I wish it hadn\u0027t ended when it did. There was something that was about to happen, I think.\" He stopped, then added slowly, \"It was as though I would rather have done it to anybody else in the room.\"\n \"Even to Georgette.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t giving two thoughts to Georgette. You don\u0027t believe me, I suppose.\"\n \"Maybe I do.\" She looked up at him. \"I\u0027ve been silly, Norman. Let\u0027s- let\u0027s live our real life. Let\u0027s not play with all the things that just might have been.\"\n But he caught her hands. \"No, Liwy. One last time. Let\u0027s see what we would have been doing right now, Liwy! This very minute! If I had married Georgette.\"\n Liwy was a little frightened. \"Let\u0027s not, Norman.\" She was thinking of his eyes, smiling hungrily at her as he held the shaker, while Georgette stood beside her, unregarded. She didn\u0027t want to know what happened afterward. She just wanted this life now, this good life.\n New Haven came and went.\n Norman said again, \"I want to try, Liwy.\"\n She said, \"If you want to, Norman.\" She decided fiercely that it wouldn\u0027t matter. Nothing would matter. Her hands reached out and encircled his arm. She held it tightly, and while she held it she thought: \"Nothing in the make-believe can take him from me.\"\n Norman said to the little man, \"Set \u0027em up again.\"\n In the yellow light the process seemed to be slower. Gently the frosted slab cleared, like clouds being torn apart and dispersed by an unfelt wind.\n Norman was saying, \"There\u0027s something wrong. That\u0027s just the two of us, exactly as we are now.\"\n He was right. Two little figures were sitting in a train on the seats which were farthest toward the front. The field was enlarging now-they were merging into it. Norman\u0027s voice was distant and fading.\n \"It\u0027s the same train,\" he was saying. \"The window in back is cracked just as-\"\n Liwy was blindingly happy. She said, \"I wish we were in New York.\"\n He said, \"It will be less than an hour, darling.\" Then he said, \"I\u0027m going to kiss you.\" He made a movement, as though he were about to begin.\n \"Not here! Oh, Norman, people are looking.\"\n Norman drew back. He said, \"We should have taken a taxi.\"\n \"From Boston to New York?\"\n \"Sure. The privacy would have been worth it.\"\n She laughed. \"You\u0027re funny when you try to act ardent.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t an act.\" His voice was suddenly a little somber. \"It\u0027s not just an hour, you know. I feel as though I\u0027ve been waiting five years.\"\n \"I do, too.\"\n \"Why couldn\u0027t I have met you first? It was such a waste.\"\n \"Poor Georgette,\" Liwy sighed.\n Norman moved impatiently. \"Don\u0027t be sorry for her, Liwy. We never really made a go of it. She was glad to get rid of me.\"\n \"I know that. That\u0027s why I say \u0027Poor Georgette.\u0027 I\u0027m just sorry for her for not being able to appreciate what she had.\"\n \"Well, see to it that you do,\" he said. \"See to it that you\u0027re immensely appreciative, infinitely appreciative-or more than that, see that you\u0027re at least half as appreciative as I am of what I\u0027ve got.\"\n \"Or else you\u0027ll divorce me, too?\"\n \"Over my dead body,\" said Norman.\n Liwy said, \"It\u0027s all so strange. I keep thinking; \u0027What if you hadn\u0027t spilt the cocktails on me that time at the party?\u0027 You wouldn\u0027t have followed me out; you wouldn\u0027t have told me; I wouldn\u0027t have known. It would have been so different . . . everything.\"\n \"Nonsense. It would have been just the same. It would have all happened another time.\"\n \"I wonder,\" said Liwy softly.\n Train noises merged into train noises. City lights flickered outside, and the atmosphere of New York was about them. The coach was astir with travelers dividing the baggage among themselves.\n Liwy was an island in the turmoil until Norman shook her.\n She looked at him and said, \"The jigsaw pieces fit after all.\"\n He said, \"Yes.\"\n She put a hand on his. \"But it wasn\u0027t good, just the same. I was very wrong. I thought that because we had each other, we should have all the possible each others. But all the possibles are none of our business. The real is enough. Do you know what I mean?\"\n He nodded.\n She said, \"There are millions of other what ifs. I don\u0027t want to know what happened in any of them. I\u0027ll never say \u0027What if again.\"\n Norman said, \"Relax, dear. Here\u0027s your coat.\" And he reached for the suitcases.\n Liwy said with sudden sharpness, \"Where\u0027s Mr. If?\"\n Norman turned slowly to the empty seat that faced them. Together they scanned the rest of the coach.\n \"Maybe,\" Norman said, \"he went into the next coach.\"\n \"But why? Besides, he wouldn\u0027t leave his hat.\" And she bent to pick it up.\n Norman said, \"What hat?\"\n And Liwy stopped her fingers hovering over nothingness. She said, \"It was here-I almost touched it.\" She straightened and said, \"Oh, Norman, what if-\"\n Norman put a finger on her mouth. \"Darling . . .\"\n She said, \"I\u0027m sorry. Here, let me help you with the suitcases.\"\n The train dived into the tunnel beneath Park Avenue, and the noise of the wheels rose to a roar. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-34.html","bookId":1734,"book":{"id":1734,"title":"The Complete Stories","description":"Storyline: \n The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}}
