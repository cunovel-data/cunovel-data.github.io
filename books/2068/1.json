{"id":111253,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"The day my life changed started out like any other. It was a hot August afternoon in 1864, the weather so oppressive that even the flies stopped swarming around the barn. The servants\u0027 children, who usually played wild games and shrieked as they ran from one chore to another, were silent. The air was still, as if holding off on a long-awaited thunderstorm. I\u0027d planned to spend a few hours riding my horse, Mezzanotte, into the cool forest on the edge of Veritas Estate--my family home. I\u0027d packed my satchel with a book and was intent on simply escaping. That was what I\u0027d been doing most days that summer. I was seventeen and restless, ready neither to join the war alongside my brother nor to have Father teach me to run the estate. Every afternoon, I had the same hope: that several hours of solitude would help me figure out who I was and what I wanted to become. My time at the Boys Academy had ended last spring, and Father had made me hold off on enrolling at the University of Virginia until the war had ended. Since then, I\u0027d been curiously stuck in the in-between. I was no longer a boy, not quite a man, and utterly unsure of what to do with myself. The worst part was that I had no one to talk to. Damon, my brother, was with General Groom\u0027s army down in Atlanta, most of my boyhood friends were either about to be betrothed or on faraway battlefields themselves, and Father was constantly in his study. \"Gonna be a hot one!\" our overseer, Robert, yelled from the edge of the barn, where he was watching two stable boys attempt to bridle one of the horses Father had purchased at auction last week. \"Yep,\" I grunted. That was another problem: While I yearned for someone to talk with, when presented with a conversation partner, I was never content. What I desperately wanted was to meet someone who could understand me, who could discuss real things like books and life, not just the weather. Robert was nice enough and one of Father\u0027s most trusted advisers, but he was so loud and brash that even a ten-minute conversation could leave me exhausted. \"Heard the latest?\" Robert asked, abandoning the horse to walk toward me. I groaned inwardly. I shook my head. \"Haven\u0027t been reading the papers. What\u0027s General Groom doing now?\" I asked, even though conversation about the war always left me uneasy. Robert shielded his eyes from the sun as he shook his head. \"No, not the war. The animal attacks. The folks over at Griffin\u0027s lost five chickens. All with gashes in their necks.\" I paused mid-step, the hairs on the back of my neck rising on end. All summer, reports of strange animal attacks had emerged from neighboring plantations. Usually, the animals were small, mostly chickens or geese, but in the past few weeks someone--probably Robert, after four or five tumblers of whiskey--had begun a rumor that the attacks were the work of demons. I didn\u0027t believe that, but it was one more reminder that the world wasn\u0027t the same one I\u0027d grown up in. Everything was changing, whether I wanted it to or not. \"Could have been a stray dog that killed them,\" I told Robert with an impatient wave of my hand, parroting the words I\u0027d overheard Father say to Robert last week. A breeze picked up, causing the horses to stomp their feet nervously. \"Well, then, I hope one of those stray dogs doesn\u0027t find you when you\u0027re out riding alone like you do every day.\" With that, Robert strode off toward the pasture. I walked into the cool, dark stable. The steady rhythm of the breathing and snorting of the horses relaxed me instantly. I plucked Mezzanotte\u0027s brush from the wall and began combing through her smooth, coal-black coat. She whinnied in appreciation. Just then, the stable door creaked open, and Father stepped in. A tall man, Father carried himself with so much force and presence that he easily intimidated those who crossed his path. His face was lined with wrinkles that only added to his authority, and he wore a formal morning coat, despite the heat. \"Stefan?\" Father called, glancing around the stalls. Even though he\u0027d lived at Veritas for years, he\u0027d probably only been in the stable a few times, preferring to have his horses prepared and brought straight to the door. I ducked out of Mezzanotte\u0027s stall. Father picked his way toward the back of the stable. His eyes flicked over me, and I felt suddenly embarrassed for him to see me caked in sweat and dirt. \"We have stable boys for a reason, son.\" \"I know,\" I said, feeling as though I\u0027d disappointed him. \"There\u0027s a time and a place for having fun with horses. But then there\u0027s the point when it\u0027s time for a boy to stop playing and become a man.\" Father hit Mezzanotte on the flanks, hard. She snorted and took a step back. I clenched my jaw, waiting for him to tell me about how, when he was my age, he\u0027d moved to Virginia from Italy with only the clothes on his back. How he\u0027d fought and bargained to build a tiny, one-acre plot of land into what was now the two hundred acres of Veritas Estate. How he\u0027d named it that because veritas was Latin for truth, because he\u0027d learned that as long as a man because he\u0027d learned that as long as a man searched for truth and fought deception, he didn\u0027t need anything else in life. Father leaned against the door of the stall. \"Rosalyn Cartwright just celebrated her sixteenth birthday. She\u0027s looking for a husband.\" \"Rosalyn Cartwright?\" I repeated. When we were twelve, Rosalyn had gone to a finishing school outside of Richmond, and I hadn\u0027t seen her in ages. She was a nondescript girl with mousy blond hair and brown eyes; in every memory I held of her, she wore a brown dress. She\u0027d never been sunny and laughing, like Clementine Haverford, or flirty and feisty, like Amelia Hawke, or whip-smart and mischievous, like Sarah Brennan. She was simply a shadow in the background, content to trail along on all our childhood adventures but never to lead them. \"Y Rosalyn Cartwright.\" Father gave me one es. of his rare smiles, with the corners of his lips turned so slightly upward, one would think he was sneering if one did not know him well. \"Her father and I have been talking, and it seems the ideal union. She\u0027s always been quite fond of you, Stefan.\" \"I don\u0027t know if Rosalyn Cartwright and I are a match,\" I mumbled, feeling as though the cool walls of the stable were closing in on me. Of course Father and Mr. Cartwright had been talking. Mr. Cartwright owned the bank in town; if Father had an alliance with him, it would be easy to expand Veritas even further. And if they\u0027d been talking, it was as good as done that Rosalyn and I were to be man and wife. \"Of course you don\u0027t know, boy!\" Father guffawed, slapping me on the back. He was in remarkably good spirits. My spirits, however, were sinking lower and lower with each word. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping this was all a bad dream. \"No boy your age knows what\u0027s good for him. That\u0027s why you need to trust me. I\u0027m arranging a dinner for next week to celebrate the two of you. In the meantime, pay her a call. Get to know her. Compliment her. Let her fall in love with you.\" Father finished, taking my hand and pressing a box inside my palm. What about me? What if I don\u0027t want her to fall in love with me? I wanted to say. But I didn\u0027t. Instead, I shoved the box in my back pocket without glancing at its contents, then went back to attending to Mezzanotte, brushing her so hard, she snorted and stepped back in indignation. \"I\u0027m glad we had this talk, son,\" Father said. I waited for him to notice that I\u0027d barely said a word, to realize that it was absurd to ask me to marry a girl I hadn\u0027t spoken to in years. \"Father?\" I said, hoping he would say something to set me free from the fate he\u0027d laid out for me. \"I think October would be lovely for a wedding,\" my father said instead, letting the door bang shut behind him. I clenched my jaw in frustration. I thought back to our childhood, when Rosalyn and I would find ourselves pushed to sit together at Saturday barbecues and church socials. But the forced socialization simply hadn\u0027t worked, and as soon as we were old enough to choose our own playmates, Rosalyn and I went our separate ways. Our relationship was going to be just as it was when we were ten years younger--ignoring each other while dutifully making our parents happy. Except now, I realized grimly, we\u0027d be bound together forever.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-origins-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-1.html","bookId":2068,"book":{"id":2068,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: Origins (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Origins (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #1) Set during the Civil War, against a backdrop of grand estates, unimaginable riches, and deadly secrets, three teenagers in Mystic Falls, Virginia enter a torrid love triangle that will span eternity.
