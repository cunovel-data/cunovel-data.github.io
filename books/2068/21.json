I wasn\u0027t sure I believed his excuse, but the house was decidedly more peaceful in his absence. Katherine came over each night to play cribbage with Father. Occasionally I\u0027d join her as a two-against-one team. While playing, Katherine would tell Father stories from her past: about her father\u0027s shipping business; about her Italian mother; about Wheat, the Scottish terrier she\u0027d had as a girl. I wondered if any of them were true, or if it was Katherine\u0027s plan to act as a modern- day Scheherazade, spinning stories that would eventually persuade Father to spare her.\\n\\n Katherine would always make a show of going back to the carriage house, and it was agony waiting for the moment when Father went to bed so that I could follow her. She never talked about her past--or her plans--with me. She didn\u0027t tell me how she got her nourishment, and I didn\u0027t ask. I didn\u0027t want to know. It was far easier to pretend she was just a normal girl.\\n\\n One afternoon, when Father was in town with Robert, discussing business with the Cartwrights, Katherine and I decided to spend an entire day together, instead of a few stolen, dark hours. It was nearing October, but no one would know it from the high temperatures and the daily late- afternoon thunderstorms. I hadn\u0027t gone swimming all summer, and I couldn\u0027t wait to feel the water of the pond on my skin--and Katherine in my arms in the daylight. I stripped down and jumped in immediately.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t splash!\" yelled Katherine. She lifted her simple blue skirt up to her ankles and cautiously stepped toward the edge of the pond. She\u0027d already left her muslin flats beneath the willow tree, and I couldn\u0027t stop staring at the delicate white of her ankles.\\n\\n \"Come in! The water\u0027s fine!\" I yelled, even though my teeth were chattering.\\n\\n Katherine continued to tiptoe toward the edge of the pond until she was standing on the muddy strip between the grass and the water. \"It\u0027s dirty.\" She wrinkled her nose, shielding her eyes from the sun.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why you have to get in. To wash off all the mud,\" I said, using my fingers to flick water toward Katherine. A few droplets landed on the bodice of her dress, and I felt desire course through me. I dunked under the water to cool my head.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not afraid of a little splashing,\" I said as I emerged, my hair dripping on my shoulders. \"Or, shall I say, you\u0027re not afraid of splashing Stefan?\" I felt a little bit ridiculous saying it, because such comments didn\u0027t sound nearly as clever on my lips. Still, she did me the favor of laughing. I carefully sidestepped the rocks on the bottom of the pond to walk closer toward her, then flicked more water in her direction.\\n\\n \"No!\" Katherine shrieked, but she made no move to run away as I walked out of the pond, grabbed her around the waist, and carried her into the water.\\n\\n \"Stefan! Stop!\" she screamed as she clung to my neck. \"At least let me take off my dress!\"\\n\\n At that, I immediately let her go. She lifted her hands over her head, allowing me to easily pull off her dress. There she stood in her little white slip. I gaped in amazement. Of course I\u0027d seen her body before, but it had always been in shadows and half-light. Now I saw the sun on her shoulders, and the way her stomach curved inward and I knew, for the millionth time, that I was in love.\\n\\n Katherine dove underwater, reemerging right next to me. \"And now, revenge!\" She leaned down and splashed cool water on me with all her might.\\n\\n \"If you weren\u0027t so beautiful, I might fight back,\" I said, pulling her toward me. I kissed her.\\n\\n \"The neighbors will talk,\" murmured Katherine against my lips.\\n\\n \"Let them talk,\" I whispered. \"I want everyone to know how much I love you.\" Katherine kissed me harder, with more passion than I\u0027d ever felt. I sucked my breath in, feeling so much desire that I stepped away. I loved Katherine so much that it almost hurt; it made it harder to breathe, harder to talk, harder to think. It was as if my desire was a force larger than myself, and I was simultaneously frightened and overjoyed to follow wherever it led me.\\n\\n I took a shaky breath and looked up at the sky. Large thunderclouds had rolled in, obscuring the sky, which had been a pure cerulean just moments before. \"We should go,\" I said, heading toward shore.\\n\\n Sure enough, as soon as we stepped onto dry land, a clap of thunder rolled off in the distance.\\n\\n \"The storm came in fast,\" Katherine observed as she wrung out her curls. She didn\u0027t seem at all self-conscious even though her soaking-wet white slip left nothing to the imagination. Somehow, it seemed almost more illicit and erotic to see her scantily dressed than to see her naked. \"One could think that it was almost a sign that our relationship is not meant to be.\" Her voice was teasing, but I felt a shiver of dread go up my spine.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said loudly, to reassure myself.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just teasing you!\" Katherine kissed my cheek before leaning down to pick up her dress. As she stole behind the weeping willow tree, I yanked up my breeches and put on my shirt.\\n\\n Katherine emerged from behind the tree a moment later, her cotton dress clinging to her curves, the damp tendrils of her hair sticking to her curves, the damp tendrils of her hair sticking to her back. Her skin had a bluish quality to it.\\n\\n I put my arms around her and rubbed her arms vigorously, trying to warm her up, though I knew that was impossible.\\n\\n \"I have something to tell you,\" Katherine said as she tilted her face up to the open sky.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I would be honored to attend the Founders Ball with you,\" she said, and then, before I could kiss her again, she broke from my embrace and ran back to the carriage house.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-origins-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-21.html","bookId":2068,"book":{"id":2068,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: Origins (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Origins (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #1) \\n Set during the Civil War, against a backdrop of grand estates, unimaginable riches, and deadly secrets, three teenagers in Mystic Falls, Virginia enter a torrid love triangle that will span eternity.
