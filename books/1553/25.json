{"id":108046,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"There was something entirely new in the girl\u0027s voice, a lilt and happiness that had certainly not been there at Royale. Bond turned and looked at her carefully for the first time. Yes, she was somehow a new woman, radiating health and a kind of inner glow.- The tumbled fair hair glittered with vitality and the half-open, beautiful lips seemed always to be on the verge of a smile. \u0027Satisfied?\u0027 \u0027You look absolutely wonderful. But now for God\u0027s sake tell me how you happened to be at Samaden. It was a bloody miracle. It saved my life.\u0027 \u0027All right. But then you tell. I\u0027ve never seen a man look so dead on his feet. I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes. I thought you must be plastered.\u0027 She gave him a quick glance. \u0027You still look pretty bad. Here\u0027 - she leant forward to the dashboard -\u0027I\u0027ll switch on the blower. Get you properly warmed up.\u0027 She paused. \u0027Well, my bit of the story\u0027s quite simple really. Papa rang me up one day from Marseilles to find out how I was. He asked if I had seen you and seemed very annoyed when he heard I hadn\u0027t. He practically ordered me to go and find you.\u0027 She glanced at him. \u0027He\u0027s quite taken to you, you know. Anyway he said he had found out the address of a certain man you were looking for. He said he was sure that by now you would have found out that address too. He said that, knowing you, I would find you somewhere close to this address. It was the Piz Gloria Club. He told me if I found you to tell you to watch your step, to look after yourself.\u0027 She laughed. \u0027How right he was! Well, so I left Davos, which had really put me on my feet again, like you said it would, and I came up to Samaden the day before yesterday. The Seilbahn wasn\u0027t running yesterday, so I was going to come up today to look for you. It was all as simple as that. Now you tell.\u0027 They had been keeping up a good speed down the sloping, winding road into the valley. Bond turned to look through the rear window. He swore under his breath. Perhaps a mile behind, twin lights were coming after them. The girl said, \u0027 I know. I\u0027ve been watching in the mirror. I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re gaining a little. Must be a good driver who knows the road. Probably got snow-chains. But I think I can hold them. Now go on. What have you been up to?\u0027 Bond gave her a garbled version. There was a big gangster up the mountain, living under a false name. He was wanted by the police in England. Bond was vaguely connected with the police, with the Ministry of Defence. (She snorted, \u0027Don\u0027t try and fool me. I know you\u0027re in the Secret Service. Papa told me so.\u0027 Bond said curtly, \u0027Well, Papa\u0027s talking through his hat.\u0027 She laughed knowingly.) Anyway, Bond continued, he had been sent out to make sure this was the man they wanted. He had found out that he was. But the man had become suspicious of Bond and Bond had had to get out quickly. He gave her a graphic account of the moonlit nightmare of the mountain, of the avalanche, of the man who had been killed by the train, of how he had got to Samaden, dead beat, and had tried to hide in the crowd on the skating-rink. \u0027And then,\u0027 he ended lamely, \u0027you turned up like a beautiful angel on skates, and here we are.\u0027 She thought the story over for a minute. Then she said calmly, \u0027And now, my darling James, just tell me how many of them you killed. And tell me the truth.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m just curious.\u0027 \u0027You promise to keep this between you and me?\u0027 She said enigmatically, \u0027Of course. Everything\u0027s between you and me from now on.\u0027 \u0027Well, there was the main guard at the so-called Club. That had to be done or I\u0027d be dead myself by now. Then I suppose one got caught by the avalanche. Then, at the bottom, one of them shot at me and I had to spear him with my ski-stick - self-defence. I don\u0027t know how badly he\u0027s hurt. And then there was the man killed by the train. He\u0027d fired six shots at me. And anyway it was his own fault. Let\u0027s say three and a half got themselves killed one way or another.\u0027 \u0027How many are left?\u0027 \u0027What are you getting at?\u0027 \u0027I just want to know. Trust me.\u0027 \u0027Well, I think there were about fifteen up there all told. So that leaves eleven and a half- plus the big man.\u0027 \u0027And there are three in the car behind? Would they kill us if they caught us?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid so. I haven\u0027t got any weapons. I\u0027m sorry, Tracy, but I\u0027m afraid you wouldn\u0027t have much chance either, being a witness and a sort of accomplice of mine. These people think I\u0027m pretty bad news for them.\u0027 \u0027And you are?\u0027 \u0027Yes. From now on, I\u0027m the worst.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027ve got pretty bad news for you. They\u0027re gaining on us and I\u0027ve only got a couple of gallons left in the tank. We\u0027ll have to stop in Filisur. There won\u0027t be a garage open and it\u0027ll mean waking someone up. Can\u0027t hope to do it under ten minutes and they\u0027ll have us. You\u0027ll have to think up something clever.\u0027 There was a ravine and an S turn over a bridge. They were coming out of the first curve over the bridge. Lights blazed at them from across the ravine. There was half a mile between the two cars, but the range across the ravine was perhaps only three hundred yards. Bond wasn\u0027t surprised to see the familiar blue flames flutter from the front of the car. Chips of granite from the overhang splattered down on the bonnet of the car. Then they were into the second half of the S bend and out of sight of their pursuers. Now came a stretch of reconstruction work where there had been a landslide. There were big warning notices: \u0027Achtung! Baustelle! Vorsichtig Fahren!\u0027 The broken road hugged the mountain-side on the right. On the left was rickety fencing and then a precipice falling hundreds of feet down into a gorge with an ice-floed river. In the middle of the bad stretch, a huge red wooden arrow pointed right to a narrow track across a temporary bridge. Bond suddenly shouted \u0027Stop!\u0027 Tracy pulled up, her front wheels on the bridge. Bond tore open the door. \u0027Get on! Wait for me round the next corner. It\u0027s the only chance.\u0027 Good girl! She got going without a word. Bond ran back the few yards to the big red arrow. It was held in the forks of two upright poles. Bond wrenched it off, swung it round so that it pointed to the left, towards the flimsy fence that closed off the yards of old road leading to the collapsed bridge. Bond tore at the fence, pulling the stakes out, flattening it. Glare showed round the corner behind him. He leaped across the temporary road into the shadow of the mountain, flattened himself against it, waited, holding his breath. The Mercedes was coming faster than it should over the bumpy track, its chains clattering inside the mudguards. It made straight for the black opening to which the arrow now pointed. Bond caught a glimpse of white, strained faces and then the desperate scream of brakes as the driver saw the abyss in front of him. The car seemed almost to stop, but its front wheels must have been over the edge. It balanced for a moment on its iron belly and then slowly, slowly toppled and there was a first appalling crash as it hit the rubble beneath the old bridge. Then another crash and another. Bond ran forward past the lying arrow and looked down. Now the car was flying upside-down through the air. It hit again and a fountain of sparks flashed from a rock ledge. Then, somersaulting, and with its lights somehow still blazing, it smashed on down into the gorge. It hit a last outcrop that knocked it sideways and, spinning laterally, but now with its lights out and only the glint of the moon on metal, it took the last great plunge into the iced-up river. A deep rumble echoed up from the gorge and there was the patter of rocks and stones following the wreckage. And then all was peaceful, moonlit silence. Bond let out his breath in a quiet hiss between his clenched teeth. Then, mechanically, he straightened things out again, put up the remains of the fence, lifted the arrow, and put it back facing to the right. Then he wiped his sweating hands down the side of his trousers and walked .unsteadily down the road and round the next corner. The little white car was there, pulled in to the side, with its lights out. Bond got in and slumped into his seat. Tracy said nothing but got the car going. The lights of Filisur appeared, warm and yellow in the valley below. She reached out a hand and held his tightly. \u0027You\u0027ve had enough for one day. Go to sleep. I\u0027ll get you to ZÃ¼rich. Please do what I say.\u0027 Bond said nothing. He pressed her hand weakly, leaned his head against the door jamb and was instantly asleep. He was out for the count. 19 Love for Breakfast IN THE grey dawn, Zurich airport was depressing and almost deserted, but, blessedly, there was a Swissair Caravelle, delayed by fog at London Airport, waiting to take off for London. Bond parked Tracy in the restaurant and, regretfully forsaking the smell of coffee and fried eggs, went and bought himself a ticket, had his passport stamped by a sleepy official (he had half expected to be stopped, but wasn\u0027t), and went to a telephone booth and shut himself in. He looked up Universal Export in the telephone book, and read underneath, as he had hoped, \u0027Hauptvertreter Alexander Muir. Privat Wohnung\u0027 and the number. Bond glanced through the glass window at the clock in the departure hall. Six o\u0027clock. Well, Muir would just have to take it. He rang the number and, after minutes, a sleepy voice said, \u0027Ja! Hier Muir.\u0027 Bond said, \u0027Sorry, 410, but this is 007. I\u0027m calling from the airport. This is bloody urgent so I\u0027ll have to take a chance on your line being bugged. Got a paper and pencil?\u0027 The voice at the other end had grown brisker. \u0027Hang on, 007. Yes, got it. Go ahead.\u0027 \u0027First of all I\u0027ve got some bad news. Your Number Two has had it. Almost for sure. Can\u0027t give you any details over this line, but I\u0027m off to London in about an hour - Swissair Flight 110 - and I\u0027ll signal the dope back straight away. Could you put that on the teleprinter? Right. Now I\u0027m guessing that in the next day or so a party often girls, British, will be coming in here by helicopter from the Engadine. Yellow Sud Aviation Alouette. I\u0027ll be teleprinting their names back from London some time today. My bet is they\u0027ll be flying to England, probably on different flights and perhaps to Prestwick and Gatwick as well as London Airport, if you\u0027ve any planes using those airports. Anyway, I guess they\u0027ll be dispersed. Now, I think it may be very important to tell London their flight numbers and ETA. Rather a big job, but I\u0027ll get you authority in a few hours to use men from Berne and Geneva to lend a hand. Got it? Right. Now I\u0027m pretty certain you\u0027re blown. Remember the old Operation Bedlam that\u0027s just been cancelled? Well, it\u0027s him and he\u0027s got radio and he\u0027ll probably have guessed I\u0027d be contacting you this morning. Just take a look out of the window and see if there\u0027s any sign of watchers. He\u0027s certainly got his men in Zurich.\u0027 \u0027Christ, what a shambles!\u0027 The voice at the other end was tight with tension. \u0027Hang on.\u0027 There was a pause. Bond could visualize Muir, whom he didn\u0027t know except as a number, going over to the window, carefully drawing aside the curtain. Muir came back on the wire.\u0027 Looks damn like it. There\u0027s a black Porsche across the road. Two men in it. I\u0027ll get my friends in the Se\"curite to chase them away.\u0027 Bond said, \u0027Be careful how you go about it. My guess is that our man has got a pretty good fix in with the police. Anyway, put all this on the telex to M personally, would you? Ciphered of course. And tell him if I get back in one piece I must see him today, with 501 [the Chief Scientific Officer to the Service] and if possible with someone in the same line of business from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Sounds daft, but there it is. It\u0027s going to upset their paper hats and Christmas pudding, but I can\u0027t help that. Can you manage all that? Good lad. Any questions?\u0027 \u0027Sure I oughtn\u0027t to come out to the airport and get some more about my Number Two? He was tailing one of Red-land\u0027s men. Chap\u0027s been buying some pretty odd stuff from the local rep. of Badische Anilin. Number Two thought it seemed damned fishy. Didn\u0027t tell me what the stuff was. Just thought he\u0027d better see where it was being delivered to.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11/page-25.html","bookId":1553,"book":{"id":1553,"title":"On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond #11)","description":"Storyline: On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond (Original Series) #11) A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him.
