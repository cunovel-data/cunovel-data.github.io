{"id":108055,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"As if to answer him, he heard the clatter of its engine high up in the mountains and in a moment the ungainly black shape crossed the moon and disappeared down the valley. Bond smiled to himself. They were going to have a tough time arguing themselves across Swiss air space this time! But Marc-Ange had thought out an alternative route over Germany. That would also not be fun. They would have to argue the toss with NATO? Well, if a Marseillais couldn\u0027t blarney his way across two hundred miles, nobody could! And now, up the road from Samaden that Bond knew so well, came the iron hee-haw warning of the local fire-engine. The blinking red light on its cabin roof was perhaps a mile away. Bond, carefully approaching the corner of the darkened cable station, prepared his story. He crept up to the wall of the building and looked round. Nobody! No trace except fresh tyre-marks outside the entrance door. Blofeld must have telephoned his man down here before he started and used him and his car for the getaway. Which way had he gone? Bond walked out on to the road. The tracks turned left. Blofeld would be at the Bernina Pass or over it by now, on his way down into Italy and away. It might still have been possible to have him held at the frontier by alerting the fire-brigade, whose lights now held Bond in their beam. No! That would be idiotic. How had Bond got this knowledge unless he himself had been up at Piz Gloria that night? No, he must just play the part of the stupidest tourist in the Engadine! The shining red vehicle pulled up in front of the cable station and the warning klaxons ran down with an iron groan. Men jumped to the ground. Some went into the station while others stood gazing up at the Piz Gloria, where a dull red glow still showed. A man in a peaked cap, presumably the captain of the team, came up to Bond and saluted. He fired off a torrent of Schwyzerdütch. Bond shook his head. The man tried French. Bond again showed incomprehension. Another man with fragmentary English was called over. \u0027What is it that is happening?\u0027 he asked. Bond shook his head dazedly. \u0027I don\u0027t know. I was walking down from Pontresina to Samaden. I came on a day excursion from Zurich and missed my bus. I was going to take a train from Samaden. Then I saw these explosions up the mountain\u0027 - he waved vaguely - \u0027and I walked up there past the station to see better, and the next thing I knew was a bang on the head and being dragged along the path.1 He indicated his bleeding head and the raw elbows that protruded from his torn sleeves. \u0027It must have been the broken cable. It must have hit me and dragged me with it. Have you got a Red Cross outfit with you?\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes.\u0027 The man called over to the group, and one of his colleagues wearing a Red Cross brassard on his arm fetched his black box from the vehicle and came over. He clucked his tongue over Bond\u0027s injuries and, while his interrogator told Bond\u0027s story to the Captain, bade Bond follow him into the toflette in the station. There, by the light of a torch, he washed Bond\u0027s wounds, applied quantities of iodine that stung like hell, and then strapped wide strips of Elastoplast over the damage. Bond looked at his face in the mirror. He laughed. Hell of a bridegroom he was going to make! The Red Cross man cluck-clucked in sympathy, produced a flask of. brandy out of his box, and offered it to Bond. Bond gratefully took a long swig. The interpreter came in. \u0027There is nothing we can do here. It will need a helicopter from the mountain rescue team. We must go back to Samaden and report. You wish to come?\u0027 \u0027I certainly do,\u0027 said Bond enthusiastically, and, with many politenesses and no question of why he should attempt the icy walk to Samaden in the dark instead of taking a taxi, he was borne comfortably to Samaden and dropped off, with the warmest gestures of goodwill and sympathy, at the railway station. By a raiding Personenzug to Coke and then by express to Zurich, Bond got to the door of the flat of Head of Station Z in the Bahnhofstrasse at two in the morning. He had had some sleep in the train but he was almost out on his feet, and his whole body felt as if it had been beaten with wooden truncheons. He leaned wearily against the bell ticketed \u0027Muir\u0027 until a tousled man in pyjamas came and opened the door and held it on the chain. \u0027Um Gottes Willen! Was ist denn los?\u0027 he inquired angrily. The English accent came through. Bond said, \u0027It\u0027s me that\u0027s “los”. It\u0027s 007 again, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027 \u0027Good God, man, come in, come in!\u0027 Muir opened the door and looked quickly up and down the empty street. \u0027Anyone after you?\u0027 \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Bond thickly, coming gratefully into the warmth of the entrance hall. Head of Z closed the door and locked it. He turned and looked at Bond. \u0027Christ, old boy, what in hell\u0027s been happening to you? You look as if you\u0027d been through a mangle. Here, come in and have a drink.\u0027 He led the way into a comfortable sitting-room. He gestured at the sideboard. \u0027Help yourself. I\u0027ll just tell Phyllis not to worry - unless you\u0027d like her to have a look at the damage. She\u0027s quite a hand at that sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027No, it\u0027s all right, thanks. A drink\u0027ll fix me. Nice and warm in here. I never want to see a patch of snow again as long as I live.\u0027 Muir went out and Bond heard a quick confabulation across the passage. Muir came back. \u0027Phyllis is fixing the spare room. She\u0027ll put some fresh dressings and stuff out in the bathroom. Now then\u0027 - he poured himself a thin whisky and soda to keep Bond company and sat down opposite him -\u0027tell me what you can.\u0027 Bond said, \u0027I\u0027m terribly sorry, but I can\u0027t tell you much. The same business as the other day. Next chapter. I promise you\u0027d do better to know nothing about it. I wouldn\u0027t have come here only I\u0027ve got to get a signal off to M, personal, triple X cipher to be deciphered by recipient only. Would you be a good chap and put it on the printer?\u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 Muir looked at his watch. \u0027Two-thirty am. Hell of a time to wake the old man up. But that\u0027s your business. Here, come into the cockpit, so to speak.\u0027 He walked across to the book-lined wall, took out a book and fiddled. There was a click and a small door swung open. \u0027Mind your head,\u0027 said Muir. \u0027Old disused lavatory. Just the right size. Gets a bit stuffy when there\u0027s a lot of traffic coming or going, but that can\u0027t be helped. We can afford to leave the door open.\u0027 He bent down to a safe on the floor, worked the combination, and brought out what looked like a portable typewriter. He set it on the shelf next to the bulky teleprinter, sat down, and clacked off the prefix and routing instructions, winding a small handle at the side of the machine at the end of each word. \u0027OK. Fire away!\u0027 Bond leaned up against the wall. He had toyed with various formulas on his journey down to Samaden. It had to be something that would get through accurately to M and yet keep Muir in the dark, keep his hands clean. Bond said, \u0027All right. Make it this, would you? REDOUBT PROPERLY FIXED STOP DETAILS LACKING AS EYE WENT SOLO AFTER THE OWNER WHO GREATLY REGRET GOT AWAY AND PROBABLY ITALICIZED BY NOW STOP FORWARDING FULL REPORT FROM STATION M THEN GRATEFULLY ACCEPTING TEN DAYS LEAVE SIGNED 007.\u0027 Muir repeated the signal and then began putting it, in the five-figure groups that had come off the Triple X machine, on to the teleprinter. Bond watched the message go, the end of another chapter of his duties, as Marc-Ange had put it, \u0027On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service\u0027. What would Her Majesty think of this string of crimes committed in her name? God, it was stuffy in the little room! Bond felt the cold sweat break out on his forehead. He put his hand up to his face, muttered something indistinctly about \u0027that bloody mountain\u0027 and gracefully crumpled to the floor. 26 Happiness Without a Shadow? TRACY GAZED at him wide-eyed when she met him outside Passport Control at Munich Airport, but she waited until they were inside the little Lancia before she burst into tears. \u0027What have they been doing to you?\u0027 she said through her sobs. \u0027What have they been doing to you now?\u0027 Bond took her in his arms. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Tracy. I promise you. These are only cuts and bruises, like a bad ski-fall. Now don\u0027t be a goose. They could happen to anyone.\u0027 He smoothed back her hair and took out his handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes. She took the handkerchief from him .and laughed through her tears. \u0027Now you\u0027ve ruined my eye-black. And I put it on so carefully for you.\u0027 She took out her pocket mirror and carefully wiped away the smudges. She said, \u0027It\u0027s so silly. But I knew you were up to no good. As soon as you said you were going off for a few days to clean up something instead of coming to me, I knew you were going to get into more trouble. And now Marc-Ange has telephoned and asked me if I\u0027ve seen you. He was very mysterious and sounded worried. And when I said I hadn\u0027t he just rang off. And now there\u0027s this story in the papers about Piz Gloria. And you were so guarded on the telephone this morning. And from Zurich. I knew it all tied up.\u0027 She put back her mirror and pressed the self-starter. \u0027All right. I won\u0027t ask questions. And I\u0027m sorry I cried.\u0027 She added fiercely, \u0027But you are such an idiot! You don\u0027t seem to think it matters to anyone. The way you go on playing Red Indians. It\u0027s so - so selfish.\u0027 Bond reached out and pressed her hand on the wheel. He hated\u0027scenes\u0027. But it was true what she said. He hadn\u0027t thought of her, only of the job. It never crossed his mind that anybody really cared about him. A shake of the head from his Mends when he went, a few careful lines in the obituary columns of The Times, a momentary pang in a few girls\u0027 hearts. But now, in three days\u0027 time, he would no longer be alone. He would be a half of two people. There wouldn\u0027t only be May and Mary Goodnight who would tut-tut over him when he came back from some job as a hospital case. Now, if he got himself killed, there would be Tracy who would at any rate partially die with him. The little car wove expertly through the traffic. Bond said, \u0027 I\u0027m sorry, Tracy. It was something that had to be done. You know how it is. I just couldn\u0027t back out of it. I really wouldn\u0027t have been happy here, like I am now, if I\u0027d shirked it. You do see that, don\u0027t you?\u0027 She reached out and touched his cheek. \u0027 I wouldn\u0027t love you if you weren\u0027t a pirate. I expect it\u0027s in the blood. I\u0027ll get used to it. Don\u0027t change. I don\u0027t want to draw your teeth like women do with their men. I want to live with you, not with somebody else. But don\u0027t mind if I howl like a dog every now and then. Or rather like a bitch. It\u0027s only love.\u0027 She gave him a fleeting smile. \u0027Die Welt, with the story in it, is behind the seat on the floor.\u0027 Bond laughed at her mind-reading. \u0027Damn you, Tracy.\u0027 He reached for the paper. He had been aching to see what it said, how much had come out. There it was, down the central gutter between the first lead, inevitably on Berlin, and the second, equally inevitably, on the miracle of the latest German export figures. All it said, \u0027from our correspondent\u0027, date-lined St Moritz, was \u0027MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSIONS ON PIZ GLORIA. Cable Railway to Millionaires\u0027 Resort Destroyed\u0027. And then a few lines repeating the content of the headings and saying that the police would investigate by helicopter at first light in the morning. The next headline caught Bond\u0027s eye: \u0027IN ENGLAND, POLIO SCARE\u0027. And then, date-lined the day before from London, a brief Reuter dispatch: \u0027The nine girls held at various British airports on suspicion of having had contact with a possible polio carrier at Zurich Airport, also an English girl, are still being held in quarantine. A Ministry of Health representative said that this was purely a routine precaution. A tenth girl, the origin of the scare, a Miss Violet O\u0027Neill, is under observation at Shannon Hospital. She is a native of Eire.\u0027 Bond smiled to himself. When they were pushed, the British could do this sort of thing supremely well. How much co-ordination had this brief report required? To begin with, M. Then the CID, MIS, Ag. and Fish., HM Customs, Passport Control, the Ministry of Health, and the Government of Eire. All had contributed, and with tremendous speed and efficiency. And the end product, put out to the world, had been through the Press Association to Reuter. Bond tossed the paper over his shoulder and watched the Raiser Yellow buildings of what had once been one of the most beautiful towns in Europe, now slowly being rebuilt in the same old Kaiser Yellow, file by in their post-war drabness. So the case was dosed, the assignment over!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11/page-34.html","bookId":1553,"book":{"id":1553,"title":"On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond #11)","description":"Storyline: On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond (Original Series) #11) A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him. It was a girl driving, a girl with a shocking pink scarf tied round her hair. And if there was one thing that set James Bond really moving, it was being passed at speed by a pretty girl. When Bond rescues a beautiful, reckless girl from self-destruction, he finds himself with a lead on one of the most dangerous men in the world—Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. In the snow-bound fastness of his Alpine base, Blofeld is conducting research that could threaten the safety of the world. To thwart the evil genius, Bond must get himself and the vital information he has gathered out of the base and keep away from SPECTRE\u0027s agents.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11.jpg","author":"Ian Fleming","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:51 PM"}}
