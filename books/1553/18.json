{"id":108039,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Bond kept his voice low. \u0027Come in!\u0027\n The door opened and quickly closed to within an inch of the lock. It was Ruby. She put her fingers to her lips and gestured towards the bathroom. Bond, highly intrigued, followed her in and shut the door. Then he turned on the light. She was blushing. She whispered imploringly, \u0027Oh, please forgive me, Sir Hilary. But I did so want to talk to you for a second.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s fine, Ruby. But why the bathroom?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, didn\u0027t you know? No, I suppose you wouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s supposed to be a secret, but of course I can tell you. You won\u0027t let on, will you?\u0027\n \u0027No, of course not.\u0027\n \u0027Well, all the rooms have microphones in them. I don\u0027t know where. But sometimes we girls have got together in each other\u0027s rooms, just for a gossip, you know, and Miss Bunt has always known. We think they\u0027ve got some sort of television too.\u0027 She giggled. \u0027We always undress in the bathroom. It\u0027s just a sort of feeling. As if one was being watched the whole time. I suppose it\u0027s something to do with the treatment.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I expect so.\u0027\n \u0027The point is, Sir Hilary, I was tremendously excited by what you were saying at lunch today, about Miss Bunt perhaps being a duchess. I mean, is that really possible?\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Bond airily.\n \u0027I was so disappointed at not being able to tell you my surname. You see, you see\u0027 - her eyes were wide with excitement - \u0027it\u0027s Windsor!\u0027\n \u0027Gosh,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027that\u0027s interesting!\u0027\n \u0027I knew you\u0027d say that. You see, there\u0027s always been talk in my family that we\u0027re distantly connected with the Royal Family!\u0027\n \u0027I can quite understand that.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was thoughtful, judicious. \u0027I\u0027d like to be able to do some work on that. What were your parents\u0027 names? I must have them first.\u0027\n \u0027George Albeit Windsor and Mary Potts. Does that mean anything?\u0027\n \u0027Well, of course, the Albert\u0027s significant.\u0027 Bond felt a cur. \u0027You see, there was the Prince Consort to Queen Victoria. He was Albert.\u0027\n \u0027Oh golly!\u0027 Ruby\u0027s knuckles went up to her mouth.\n \u0027But of course all this needs a lot of working on. Where do you come from in England? Where were you born?\u0027\n \u0027In Lancashire. Morecambe Bay, where the shrimps come from. But a lot of poultry too. You know.\u0027\n \u0027So that\u0027s why you love chicken so much.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, no.\u0027 She seemed surprised by the remark. \u0027That\u0027s just the point. You see, I was allergic to chickens. I simply couldn\u0027t bear them - all those feathers, the stupid pecking, the mess and the smell. I loathed them. Even eating chicken brought me out in a sort of rash. It was awful, and of course my parents were mad at me, they being poultry fanners in quite a big way and me being supposed to help clean out the batteries - you know, those modern mass-produced chicken places. And then one day I saw this advertisement in the paper, in the Poultry Farmer\u0027s Gazette. It said that anyone suffering from chicken allergy - then followed a long Latin name - could apply for a course of re... of re... for a cure in a Swiss institute doing research work on the thing. All found and ten pounds a week pocket-money. Rather like those people who go and act as rabbits in that place that\u0027s trying to find a cure for colds.\u0027\n \u0027I know,\u0027 said Bond encouragingly.\n \u0027So I applied and my fare was paid down to London and I met Miss Bunt and she put me through some sort of exam.\u0027 She giggled. \u0027Heaven only knows how I passed it, as I failed my G.C.E. twice. But she said I was just what the Institute wanted and I came out here about two months ago. It\u0027s not bad. They\u0027re terribly strict. But the Count has absolutely cured my trouble. I simply love chickens now.\u0027 Her eyes became suddenly rapt.\u0027 I think they\u0027re just the most beautiful, wonderful birds in the world.\u0027\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s a jolly good show,\u0027 said Bond, totally mystified. \u0027Now about your name. Til get to work on it right away. But how are we going to talk? You all seem to be pretty carefully organized. How can I see you by yourself? The only place is my room or yours.\u0027\n \u0027You mean at night?\u0027 The big blue eyes were wide with fright, excitement, maidenly appraisal.\n \u0027Yes, it\u0027s the only way.\u0027 Bond took a bold step towards her and kissed her full on the mouth. He put his arms round her clumsily. \u0027And you know I think you\u0027re terribly attractive.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Sir Hilary!\u0027\n But she didn\u0027t recoil. She just stood there like a great lovely doll, passive, slightly calculating, wanting to be a princess. \u0027But how would you get out of here? They\u0027re terribly strict. A guard goes up and down the passage every so often. Of course\u0027 - the eyes were calculating - \u0027it\u0027s true that I\u0027m next door to you, in Number Three actually. If only we had some way of getting out.\u0027\n Bond took one of the inch strips of plastic out of his pocket and showed it to her. \u0027I knew you were somewhere close to me. Instinct, I suppose. [Cad!] I learned a thing or two in the Army. You can get out of these sort of doors by slipping this in the door crack in front of the lock and pushing. It slips the latch. Here, take this, I\u0027ve got another. But hide it away. And promise not to tell anyone.\u0027\n \u0027Ooh! You are a one! But of course I promise. But do you think there\u0027s any hope - about the Windsors, I mean?\u0027 Now she put her arms round his neck, round the witchdoctor\u0027s neck, and the big blue orbs gazed appealingly into his.\n \u0027You definitely mustn\u0027t rely on it,\u0027 said Bond firmly, trying to get back an ounce of his self-respect. \u0027But I\u0027ll have a quick look now in my books. Not much time before drinks. Anyway, we\u0027ll see.\u0027 He gave her another long and, he admitted to himself, extremely splendid kiss, to which she responded with an animalism that slightly salved his conscience. \u0027Now then, baby.\u0027 His right hand ran down her back to the curve of her behind, to which he gave an encouraging and hastening pat. \u0027We\u0027ve got to get you out of here.\u0027\n His bedroom was dark. They listened at the door like two children playing hide-and-seek. The building was in silence. He inched open the door. He gave the behind an extra pat and she was gone.\n Bond paused for a moment. Then he switched on the light. The innocent room smiled at him. Bond went to his table and reached for the Dictionary of British Surnames. Windsor, Windsor, Windsor. Here we are! Now then! As he bent over the small print, an important reflection seared his spy\u0027s mind like a shooting star. All right. So sexual perversions, and sex itself, were a main security risk. So was greed for money. But what about status? What about that most insidious of vices, snobbery?\n Six o\u0027clock came. Bond had a nagging headache, brought on by hours of poring over small-print reference books and aggravated by the lack of oxygen at the high altitude. He needed a drink, three drinks. He had a quick shower and smartened himself up, rang his bell for the \u0027warder\u0027 and went along to the bar. Only a few of the girls were already there. Violet sat alone at the bar and Bond joined her. She seemed pleased to see him. She was drinking a Daiquiri. Bond ordered another and, for himself, a double Bourbon on the rocks. He took a deep pull at it and put the squat glass down. \u0027By God, I needed that! I\u0027ve been working like a slave all day while you\u0027ve been waltzing about the ski-slopes in the sun!\u0027\n \u0027Have I indeed!\u0027 A slight Irish brogue came out with the indignation. \u0027Two lectures this morning, frightfully boring, and I had to catch up with my reading most of this afternoon. I\u0027m way behind with it.\u0027\n \u0027What sort of reading?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, sort of agricultural stuff.\u0027 The dark eyes watched him carefully. \u0027We\u0027re not supposed to talk about our cures, you know.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, well,\u0027 said Bond cheerfully, \u0027then let\u0027s talk about something else. Where do you come from?\u0027\n \u0027Ireland. The South. Near Shannon.\u0027\n Bond had a shot in the dark. \u0027All that potato country.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s right. I used to hate them. Nothing but potatoes to eat and potato crops to talk about. Now I\u0027m longing to get back. Funny, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Your family\u0027ll be pleased.\u0027\n \u0027You can say that again! And my boy friend! He\u0027s on the wholesale side. I said I wouldn\u0027t marry anyone who had anything to do with the damned, dirty, ugly things. He\u0027s going to get a shock all right...\u0027\n \u0027How\u0027s that?\u0027\n \u0027All I\u0027ve learned about how to improve the crop. The latest scientific ways, chemicals, and so on.\u0027 She put her hand up to her mouth. She glanced swiftly round the room, at the bartender. To see if anyone had heard this innocent stuff?\n She put on a hostess smile. \u0027Now you tell me what you\u0027ve been working on, Sir Hilary.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, just some heraldic stuff for the Count. Like I was talking about at lunch. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027d find it frightfully dry stuff.\u0027\n \u0027Oh no, I wouldn\u0027t. I was terribly interested in what you were saying to Miss Bunt. You see\u0027 - she lowered her voice and spoke into her raised glass - \u0027I\u0027m an O\u0027Neill. They used to be almost kings of Ireland. Do you think...\u0027 She had seen something over his shoulder. She went on smoothly, \u0027And I simply can\u0027t get my shoulders round enough. And when I try to I simply over-balance.\u0027\n \"Fraid I don\u0027t know anything about skiing,\u0027 said Bond loudly.\n Irma Bunt appeared in the mirror over the bar. \u0027Ah, Sair Hilary.\u0027 She inspected his face. \u0027But yes, you are already getting a little of the sunburn, isn\u0027t it? Come! Let us go and sit down. I see poor Miss Ruby over there all by herself.\u0027\n They followed her meekly. Bond was amused by the little undercurrent of rule-breaking that went on among the girls -the typical resistance pattern to strict discipline and the governessy ways of this hideous matron. He must be careful how he handled it, useful though it was proving. It wouldn\u0027t do to get these girls too much \u0027on his side\u0027. But, if only because the Count didn\u0027t want him to know them, he must somehow ferret away at their surnames and addresses. Ferret! That was the word! Ruby would be his ferret. Bond sat down beside her, the back of his hand casually brushing against her shoulder.\n More drinks were ordered. The Bourbon was beginning to uncoil Bond\u0027s tensions. His headache, instead of occupying his whole head, had localized itself behind the right temple. He said, gaily, \u0027Shall we play the game again?\u0027\n There was a chorus of approval. The glass and paper napkins were brought from the bar and now more of the girls joined in. Bond handed round cigarettes and the girls puffed vigorously, occasionally choking over the smoke. Even Irma Bunt seemed infected by the laughter and squeals of excitement as the cobweb of paper became more and more tenuous. \u0027Careful! Gently, Elizabeth! Ayee! But now you have done it! And there was still this little corner that was safe!\u0027\n Bond was next to her. Now he sat back and suggested that the girls should have a game among themselves. He turned to Fraulein Bunt. \u0027 By the way, if I can find the time, it crossed my mind that it might be fun to go down in the cable car and pay a visit to the valley. I gathered from talk among the crowds today that St Moritz is the other side of the valley. I\u0027ve never been there. I\u0027d love to see it.\u0027\n \u0027Alas, my dear Sair Hilary, but that is against the rules of the house. Guests here, and the staff too, have no access to the Seilbahn. That is only for the tourists. Here we keep ourselves to ourselves. We are - how shall I say? - a little dedicated community. We observe the rules almost of a monastery. It is better so, isn\u0027t it? Thus we can pursue our researches in peace.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I quite see that.\u0027 Bond\u0027s smile was understanding, friendly. \u0027But I hardly count myself as a patient here, really. Couldn\u0027t an exception be made in my case?\u0027\n \u0027I think that would be a mistake, Sair Hilary. And surely you will need all the time you have to complete your duties for the Count. No\u0027 - it was an order - \u0027I am afraid, with many apologies, that what you ask is out of the question.\u0027 She glanced at her watch and clapped her hands. \u0027And now, girls,\u0027 she called, \u0027it is time for the supper. Come along! Come along!\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11/page-18.html","bookId":1553,"book":{"id":1553,"title":"On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond #11)","description":"Storyline: \n On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond (Original Series) #11) \n A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him.
