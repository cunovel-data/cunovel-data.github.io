{"id":108035,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"It was time to make the going again! Resignedly, Bond turned to Fraulein Bunt. \u0027Fraulein Bunt. Please explain to me. What is the difference between a piz and an alp and a berg?\u0027\\n\\n The yellow eyes gleamed with academic enthusiasm. \u0027Ah, Sair Hilary, but that is an interesting question. It had not occurred to me before. Now let me see.\u0027 She gazed into the middle distance. \u0027A piz, that is only a local name in this department of Switzerland for a peak. An alp, that one would think would be smaller than a berg - a hill, perhaps, or an upland pasture, as compared with a mountain. But that is not so. These\u0027 - she waved her hand - \u0027are all alps and yet they are great mountains. It is the same in Austria, certainly in the Tyrol. But in Germany, in Bavaria for instance, which is my home land, there it is all bergs. No Sair Hilary\u0027 - the box-like smile was switched on and off - \u0027 I cannot help you. But why do you ask?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In my profession,\u0027 said Bond prosily, \u0027the exact meaning of words is vital. Now, before we met for cocktails, it amused me to look up your surname, Bunt, in my books of reference. What I found, Fraulein, was most interesting. Bunt, it seems, is German for “gay”, “happy”. In England, the name has almost certainly been corrupted into Bounty, perhaps even into Bronte, because the grandfather of the famous literary family by that name had in fact changed his name from the less aristocratic name of Brunty. Now this is most interesting.\u0027 (Bond knew that it wasn\u0027t, that this was all hocus-pocus, but he thought it would do no harm to stretch his heraldic muscles.) \u0027Can you remember if your ancestors had any connexion with England? There is the Dukedom of Bronte, you see, which Nelson assumed. It would be interesting to establish a connexion.\u0027\\n\\n The penny dropped! A duchess! Irma Bunt, hooked, went off into a dreary chronicle of her forebears, including proudly, distant relationship with a Graf von Bunt. Bond listened politely, prodding her back to the immediate past. She gave the name of her father and mother. Bond filed them away. He now had enough to find out in due course exactly who Irma Bunt was. What a splendid trap snobbery was! How right Sable Basilisk had been! There is a snob in all of us and only through snobbery could Bond have discovered who the parents of this woman were.\\n\\n Bond finally calmed down the woman\u0027s momentary fever, and the head waiter, who had been politely hovering, presented giant menus covered in violet ink. There was everything from caviar down to Double Mokka au whisky irlandais. There were also many \u0027spécialités Gloria\u0027 - Poulet Gloria, Homard Gloria, Tournedos Gloria, and so on. Bond, despite his forswearing of specialties, decided to give the chicken a chance. He said so and was surprised by the enthusiasm with which Ruby greeted his choice. \u0027Oh, how right you are, Sir Hilary! I adore chicken too. I absolutely dote on it. Can I have that too, please, Miss Bunt?\u0027\\n\\n There was such surprising fervour in her voice that Bond watched Irma Bunt\u0027s face. What was that matronly gleam in her eye as she gave her approval? It was more than approval for a good appetite among her charges. There was enthusiasm, even triumph there. Odd! And it happened again when Violet stipulated plenty of potatoes with her tournedos. \u0027I simply love potatoes,\u0027 she explained to Bond, her eyes shining. \u0027Don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re fine,\u0027 agreed Bond. \u0027When you\u0027re taking plenty of exercise, that is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, they\u0027re just darling,\u0027 enthused Violet. \u0027Aren\u0027t they, Miss Bunt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very good indeed, my dear. Very good for you too. And Fritz, I will just have the mixed salad with some cottage cheese.\u0027 She gave the caricature of a simper. \u0027Alas\u0027 - she spoke to Bond - \u0027I have to watch my figure. These young things take plenty of exercise, while I must stay in my office and do the paper-work, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n At the next table Bond heard the girl with the Scottish burr, her voice full of saliva, ask that her Aberdeen Angus steak should be cooked very rare indeed. \u0027Guid and bluidy,\u0027 she emphasized.\\n\\n What was this? wondered Bond. A gathering of beautiful ogresses? Or was this a day off from some rigorous diet? He felt completely clueless, out of his depth. Well, he would just go on digging. He turned to Ruby. \u0027You see what I mean about surnames. Fraulein Bunt may even have distant claim to an English title. Now what\u0027s yours, for instance? I\u0027ll see what I can make of it.\u0027\\n\\n Fraulein Bunt broke in sharply. \u0027No surnames here, Sair Hilary. It is a rule of the house. We use only first names for the girls. It is part of the Count\u0027s treatment. It is bound up with a change, a transference of identity, to help the cure. You understand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s way out of my depth,\u0027 said Bond cheerfully.\\n\\n \u0027No doubt the Count will explain some of these matters to you tomorrow. He has special theories. One day the world will be startled when he reveals his methods.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Bond politely. \u0027Well now\u0027 - he searched for a subject that would leave his mind free to roam on its own. \u0027Tell me about your skiing. How are you getting on? Don\u0027t do it myself, I\u0027m afraid. Perhaps I shall pick up some tips watching your classes.\u0027\\n\\n It was an adequate ball which went bouncing on between Ruby and Violet, and Bond kept it in play while their food came and proved delicious. Poulet Gloria was spatchcocked, with a mustard-and-cream sauce. The girls fell silent over their dishes, consuming them with polite but concentrated greed. There was a similar pause in the chatter at the other tables. Bond made conversation about the decor of the room and this gave him a chance to have a good look at the waiters. There were twelve of them in sight. It was not difficult to sum them up as three Corsicans, three Germans, three vaguely Balkan faces, Turks, Bulgars, or Yugoslavs, and three obvious Slavs. There would probably be three Frenchmen in the kitchen. Was this the old pattern of SPECTRE? The well-tried communist-cell pattern of three men from each of the great gangster and secret-service organizations in Europe? Were the three Slavs ex-Smersh men? The whole lot of them looked tough enough, had that quiet smell of the pro. The man at the airport was one of them. Bond recognized others as the reception steward and the man who had come to his room about the table. He heard the girls calling them Fritz, Joseph, Ivan, Achmed. And some of them were ski guides during the day. Well, it was a nice little set-up if Bond was right.\\n\\n Bond excused himself after dinner on the grounds of work. He went to his room and laid out his books and papers on the desk and on the extra table that had been provided. He bent over them studiously while his mind reviewed the day.\\n\\n At ten o\u0027clock he heard the goodnights of the girls down the corridor and the click of the doors shutting. He undressed, turned the thermostat on the wall down from eighty-five to sixty, switched off the light, and lay on his back for a while staring up into the darkness. Then he gave an authentic sigh of exhaustion for the microphones, if any, and turned over on his side and went to sleep.\\n\\n Later, much later, he was awakened by a very soft murmuring that seemed to come from somewhere under the floor, but very, very far away. He identified it as a minute, spidery whispering that went on and on. But he could not make out any words and he finally put it down to the central-heating pipes, turned over, and went to sleep again.\\n\\n 11\\n\\n Death for Breakfast\\n\\n JAMES BOND awoke to a scream. It was a terrible, masculine scream out of hell. It fractionally held its first high, piercing note and then rapidly diminished as if the man had jumped off a cliff. It came from the right, from somewhere near the cable station perhaps. Even in Bond\u0027s room, muffled by the double windows, it was terrifying enough. Outside it must have been shattering.\\n\\n Bond jumped up and pulled back the curtains, not knowing what scene of panic, of running men, would meet his eyes. But the only man in sight was one of the guides, walking slowly, stolidly up the beaten snow-path from the cable station to the club. The spacious wooden veranda that stretched from the wall of the club out over the slope of the mountain was empty, but tables had been laid for breakfast and the upholstered chaises-longue for the sunbathers had already been drawn up in their meticulous, colourful rows. The sun was blazing down out of a crystal sky. Bond looked at his watch. It was eight o\u0027clock. Work began early in this place! People died early. For that had undoubtedly been the death-scream. He turned back into his room and rang the bell.\\n\\n It was one of the three men Bond had suspected of being Russians. Bond became the officer and gentleman. \u0027What is your name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Peter sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Piotr?\u0027 Bond longed to say. \u0027And how are all my old friends from SMERSH?\u0027 He didn\u0027t. He said, \u0027What was that scream?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pliss?\u0027 The granite-grey eyes were careful.\\n\\n \u0027A man screamed just now. From over by the cable station. What was it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It seems there has been an accident, sir. You wish for breakfast?\u0027 He produced a large menu from under his arm and, held it out clumsily.\\n\\n \u0027What sort of an accident?\"\\n\\n \u0027It seems that one of the guides has fallen.\u0027\\n\\n How could this man have known that, only minutes after the scream? \u0027Is he badly hurt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is possible, sir.\u0027 The eyes, surely trained in investigation, held Bond\u0027s blandly. \u0027You wish for breakfast?\u0027 The menu was once again nudged forward.\\n\\n Bond said, with sufficient concern, \u0027Well, I hope the poor chap\u0027s all right.\u0027 He took the menu and ordered. \u0027Let me know if you hear what happened.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There will no doubt be an announcement if the matter is serious. Thank you, sir.\u0027 The man withdrew.\\n\\n It was the scream that triggered Bond into deciding that, above all things, he must keep fit. He suddenly felt that, despite all the mystery and its demand for solution, there would come a moment when he would need all his muscle. Reluctantly he proceeded to a quarter of an hour of knee-bends and press-ups and deep-breathing chest-expansions -exercises of the skiing muscles. He guessed that he might have to get away from this place. But quick!\\n\\n He took a shower and shaved. Breakfast was brought by Peter. \u0027Any more news about this poor guide?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have heard no more, sir. It concerns the outdoor staff. I work inside the club.\u0027\\n\\n Bond decided to play it down. \u0027He must have slipped and broken an ankle. Poor chap! Thank you, Peter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027 Did the granite eyes contain a sneer?\\n\\n James Bond put his breakfast on the desk and, with some difficulty, managed to prise open the double window. He removed the small bolster that lay along the sill between the panes to keep out draughts, and blew away the accumulated dust and small fly-corpses. The cold, savourless air of high altitudes rushed into the room and Bond went to the thermostat and put it up to 90 as a counter-attack. While, his head below the level of the sill, he ate a spare continental breakfast, he heard the chatter of the girls assembling outside on the terrace. The voices were high with excitement and debate. Bond could hear every word.\\n\\n \u0027I really don\u0027t think Sarah should have told on him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he came in in the dark and started mucking her about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean actually interfering with her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So she says. If I\u0027d been her, I\u0027d have done the same. And he\u0027s such a beast of a man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was, you mean. Which one was it, anyway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One of the Yugos. Bertil.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I know. Yes, he was pretty horrible. He had such dreadful teeth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You oughtn\u0027t to say such things of the dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you know he\u0027s dead? What happened to him, anyway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He was one of the two you see spraying the start of the bob-run. You see them with hoses every morning. It\u0027s to get it good and icy so they\u0027ll go faster. Fritz told me he somehow slipped, lost his balance, or something. And that was that. He just went off down the run like a sort of human bob-sleigh.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11/page-14.html","bookId":1553,"book":{"id":1553,"title":"On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond #11)","description":"Storyline: On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond (Original Series) #11) \\n A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him.
