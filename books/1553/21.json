{"id":108042,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Bond surveyed his weapons. They were only his hands and feet, his Gillette razor and his wrist-watch, a heavy Rolex Oyster Perpetual on an expanding metal bracelet. Used properly, these could be turned into most effective knuckledusters. Bond got up, took the blade out of his Gillette and dropped the razor into his trouser pocket. He slipped the shaft between the first and second fingers of his left hand so that the blade-carrier rested flat along his knuckles. Yes, that was the way! Now was there anything, any evidence he should try and take with him? Yes, he must try and get more, if not all, of the girls\u0027 names and, if possible, addresses. For some reason he knew they were vital. For that he would have to use Ruby. His head full of plans for getting the information out of her, Bond went out of the bathroom and sat down at his desk and got on with a fresh page of de Bleuvilles. At least he must continue to show willing, if only to the recording eye in the ceiling.\n It was about twelve-thirty when Bond heard his doorknob being softly turned. Ruby slipped in and, her finger to her lips, disappeared into his bathroom. Bond casually threw down his pen, got up and stretched and strolled over and went in after her.\n Ruby\u0027s blue eyes were wide and frightened. \u0027You\u0027re in trouble,\u0027 she whispered urgently. \u0027What have you been doing?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Bond innocently. \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ve all been told that we mustn\u0027t talk to you unless Miss Bunt is there.\u0027 Her knuckles went distractedly up to her teeth. \u0027Do you think they know about Mi?\u0027\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t possibly,\u0027 said Bond, radiating confidence. \u0027I think I know what it is.\u0027 (With so much obfuscation in the air, what did an extra, a reassuring, lie matter?) \u0027This morning the Count told me I was an upsetting influence here, that I was what he called “disruptive”, interfering with your treatments. He asked me to keep myself more to myself. Honestly\u0027 - (how often that word came into a lie!) - \u0027I\u0027m sure that\u0027s all it is. Rather a pity really. Apart from you - I mean you\u0027re sort of special - I think all you girls are terribly sweet. I\u0027d like to have helped you all.\u0027\n \u0027How do you mean? Helped us?\u0027\n \u0027Well, this business of surnames. I talked to Violet last night. She seemed awfully interested. I\u0027m sure it would have amused all the others to have theirs done. Everyone\u0027s interested in where they came from. Rather like palmistry in a way.\u0027 Bond wondered how the College of Arms would have liked that one! He shrugged. \u0027Anyway, I\u0027ve decided to get the hell away from here. I can\u0027t bear being shepherded and ordered about like this. Who the hell do they think I am? But I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. If you can give me the names of the girls, as many as you know, I\u0027ll do a piece on each of them and post them when you all get back to England. How much longer have you got, by the way?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not told exactly, but the rumour is about another week. There\u0027s another batch of girls due about then. When we\u0027re slow at our work or get behind-hand with our reading,\n Miss Bunt says she hopes the next lot won\u0027t be so stupid. The old bitch! But Sir Hilary\u0027 - the blue eyes filled with concern - \u0027how are you going to get away? You know we\u0027re practically prisoners up here.\u0027\n Bond was off-hand. \u0027Oh, I\u0027ll manage somehow. They can\u0027t hold me here against my will. But what about the names, Ruby? Don\u0027t you think it would give the girls a treat?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, they\u0027d love it. Of course I know all of them. We\u0027ve found plenty of ways of exchanging secrets. But you won\u0027t be able to remember. Have you got anything to write down on?\u0027\n Bond tore off some strips of lavatory paper and took out a pencil. \u0027Fire away!\u0027\n She laughed. \u0027Well, you know me and Violet, then there\u0027s Elizabeth Mackinnon. She\u0027s from Aberdeen. Beryl Morgan from somewhere in Herefordshire. Pearl Tampion, Devonshire - by the way, all those simply loathed every kind of cattle. Now they live on steaks! Would you believe it? I must say the Count\u0027s a wonderful man.\"\n \u0027Yes, indeed.\u0027\n \u0027Then there\u0027s Anne Charter from Canterbury and Caresse Ventnor from the National Stud, wherever that is - fancy her working there and she came up in a rash all over whenever she went near ajhorse! Now all she does is dream of pony clubs and read every word she can get hold of about Pat Smythe! And Denise Robertson...\"\n The list went on until Bond had got the whole ten. He said, \u0027What about that Polly somebody who left in November?\u0027\n \u0027Polly Tasker. She was from East Anglia. Don\u0027t remember where, but I can find out the address when I get back to England. Sir Hilary\u0027 - she put her arm round his neck -\u0027lam going to see you again, aren\u0027t I?\u0027\n Bond held her tight and kissed her. \u0027Of course, Ruby. You can always get me at the College of Arms in Queen Victoria Street. Just send me a postcard when you get back. But for God\u0027s sake cut out the “ Sir”. You\u0027re my girl friend. Remember?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, I will - er - Hilary,\u0027 she said fervently. \u0027And you will be careful, getting away I mean. You\u0027re sure it\u0027s all right? Is there anything I can do to help?\u0027\n \u0027No, darling. Just don\u0027t breathe a word of all this. It\u0027s a secret between us. Right?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, darling.\u0027 She glanced at her watch. \u0027Oh lord! I must simply fly. Only ten minutes to lunch-time. Now, can you do your trick with the door? There shouldn\u0027t be anyone about. It\u0027s their lunch-time from twelve till one.\u0027\n Bond, out of any possible line of vision from the eye in the ceiling, did his trick with the door and she was gone with a last whispered goodbye.\n Bond eased the door shut. He let out a deep sigh and went over to the window and peered out through the snow-heaped panes. It was thick as Hades outside and the fine powder snow on the veranda was whirling up in little ghosts as the wind tore at the building. Pray God it would let up by nighttime! Now, what did he need in the way of equipment? Goggles and gloves were two items he might harvest over lunch. Bond went into the bathroom again and rubbed soap into his eyes. It stung like hell, but the blue-grey eyes emerged from the treatment realistically bloodshot. Satisfied, Bond rang for the \u0027warden\u0027 and went thoughtfully off to the restaurant.\n Silence fell as he went through the swing doors, followed by a polite, brittle chatter. Eyes followed him discreetly as he crossed the room and the replies to his good-mornings were muted. Bond took his usual seat between Ruby and Fraulein Bunt. Apparently oblivious to her frosty greeting, he snapped his fingers for a waiter and ordered his double vodka dry Martini. He turned to Fraulein Bunt and smiled into the suspicious yellow eyes. \u0027Would you be very kind?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Sair Hilary. What is it?\u0027\n Bond gestured at his still watering eyes. \u0027I\u0027ve got the Count\u0027s trouble. Sort of conjunctivitis, I suppose. The tremendous glare up here. Better today of course, but there\u0027s still a lot of reflection from the snow. And all this paperwork. Could you get me a pair of snow-goggles? I\u0027ll only need to borrow them for a day or two. Just till my eyes get used to the light. Don\u0027t usually have this sort of trouble.\u0027\n \u0027Yes. That can be done. I will see that they are put in your room.\u0027 She summoned the head waiter and gave him the order in German. The man, looking at Bond with overt dislike, said, \u0027Sofort, gnadiges Fraulein,\u0027 and clicked his heels.\n \u0027And one more thing, if you will,\u0027 said Bond politely. \u0027A small flask of schnapps.\u0027 He turned to Fraulein Bunt. \u0027I find I am not sleeping well up here. Perhaps a nightcap would help. I always have one at home - generally whisky. But here I would prefer schnapps. When in Gloria, do as the Glorians do. Ha ha!\u0027\n Fraulein Bunt looked at him stonily. She said to the waiter curtly, \u0027In Ordnung!\u0027 The man took Bond\u0027s order of Pat6 Maison followed by CEufs Gloria and the cheese tray (Bond thought he had better get some stuffing into him!), clicked his heels and went away. Was he one of those who had been at work in the interrogation room? Bond silently ground his teeth. By God, if it came to hitting any of these guards tonight, he was going to hit them damned hard, with everything he\u0027d got! He felt Fraulein Bunt\u0027s eyes inquisitively on him. He untensed himself and began to make amiable conversation about the storm. How long would it last? What was the barometer doing?\n Violet, guardedly but helpfully, said the guides thought it would clear up during the afternoon. The barometer was rising. She looked nervously at Fraulein Bunt to see if she had said too much to the pariah, and then, not reassured, went back to her two vast baked potatoes with poached eggs in them.\n Bond\u0027s drink came. He swallowed it in two gulps and ordered another. He felt like making any gesture that would startle and outrage. He said, combatively, to Fraulein Bunt, \u0027And how is that poor chap who came up in the cable car this morning? He looked in terrible shape. I do hope he\u0027s up and about again.\u0027\n \u0027He makes progress.\u0027\n \u0027Oh! Who was that?\u0027 asked Ruby eagerly.\n \u0027It was an intruder.\u0027 Fraulein Bunt\u0027s eyes were hard with warning. \u0027It is not a subject for conversation.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, but why not?\u0027 asked Bond innocently. \u0027After all, you can\u0027t get much excitement up here. Anything out of the ordinary should be a bit of a relief.\u0027\n She said nothing. Bond raised his eyebrows politely and then accepted the snub with a good grace. He asked if any newspapers came up. Or was there a radio bulletin like on board ship? Did they get any news from the outside world?\n \u0027No.\u0027\n Bond gave up the struggle and got on with his lunch. Ruby\u0027s foot crept up against his in sympathy with the man sent to Coventry. Bond gave it a gentle kick of warning and withdrew his. The girls at the other tables began to leave. Bond toyed with his cheese and coffee until Fraulein Bunt got to her feet and said, \u0027Come, girls.\u0027 Bond rose and sat down again. Now, except for the waiters clearing up, he was alone in the restaurant. That was what he wanted. He got up and strolled to the door. Outside, on pegs against the wall, the girls\u0027 outdoor coats and siding gloves hung in an orderly row. The corridor was empty. Bond swept the largest pair of leather gauntlets he could see off the peg where they hung by their joining cord and stuffed them inside his sweater. Then he sauntered along to the reception room. It was empty. The door to the ski-room was open and the surly man was at his work-bench. Bond went in and made one-sided conversation about the weather. Then, under cover of desultory talk about whether the metal skis were not more dangerous than the old wooden ones, he wandered, his hands innocently in his pockets, round the numbered racks in which the skis stood against the wall. They were mostly the girls\u0027 skis. No good! The bindings would be too small for his boots. But, by the door, in unnumbered slots, stood the guides\u0027 skis. Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed to slits as he scanned them, measuring, estimating. Yes, the pair of metal Heads with the red V\u0027s painted on the black curved tips was the best bet. They were of the stiffer,\n Master\u0027s, category, designed for racing. Bond remembered reading somewhere that the Standard model was inclined to \u0027float\u0027 at speed. His choice had the Attenhofer Flex forward release with the Marker lateral release. Two transverse leather thongs wound round the ankle and buckled over the instep would, if he fell, which he was certain to do, ensure against losing a ski.\n Bond made a quick guess at how much the bindings would need adjustment to fit his boots and went off down the corridor to his room.\n 16\n Downhill Only\n Now IT was just a question of sitting out the hours. When would they have finished with Campbell? Quick, rough torture is rarely effective against a professional, apart from the likelihood of the man rapidly losing consciousness, becoming so punch-drunk that he is incoherent. The pro, if he is a tough man spiritually, can keep the \u0027game\u0027 alive for hours by minor admissions, by telling long, rambling tales and sticking to them. Such tales need verification. Blofeld would undoubtedly have his man in Zurich, would be able to contact him on his radio, get him to check this or that date or address, but that also would require time. Then, if it was proved that Campbell had told lies, they would have to begin again. So far as Bond and his identity were concerned, it all depended on Campbell\u0027s reading of why Bond was up at the Gloria Club. He must guess, because of Bond\u0027s curt disavowal of him, that it was something clandestine, something important. Would he have the wits to cover up Bond, the guts, against the electrical and mechanical devices they would surely use against him? He could say that, when he came to and saw Bond, in his semi-conscious state he had for a moment thought Bond was his brother, James Campbell. Some story like that. If he had the wits! If he had the guts! Had Campbell got a death pill, perhaps one of the buttons on his ski-jacket or trousers? Bond sharply put the thought away. He had been on the edge of wishing that Campbell had! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11/page-21.html","bookId":1553,"book":{"id":1553,"title":"On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond #11)","description":"Storyline: \n On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond (Original Series) #11) \n A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him.
