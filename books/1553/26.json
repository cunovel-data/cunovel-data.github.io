{"id":108047,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u0027I thought it must be some kind of a spiel like that. No. You stay away from me. I\u0027m hot as a pistol, going to be hotter later in the day when they find a certain Mercedes at the bottom of a precipice. I\u0027ll get off the line now. Sorry to have wrecked your Christmas. \u0027Bye.\u0027\n Bond put down the receiver and went up to the restaurant. Tracy had been watching the door. Her face lit up when she saw him. He sat down very close to her and took her hand, a typical airport farewell couple. He ordered plenty of scrambled eggs and coffee. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Tracy. I\u0027ve fixed everything at my end. But now about you. That car of yours is going to be bad news. There\u0027ll be people who\u0027ll have seen you drive away with the Mercedes on your tail. There always are, even at midnight on Christmas Eve. And the big man on top of the mountain has got his men down here too. You\u0027d better finish your breakfast and get the hell on over the frontier. Which is the nearest?\u0027\n \u0027Schaffhausen or Konstanz, I suppose, but\u0027 - she pleaded -\u0027James, do I have to leave you now? It\u0027s been so long waiting for you. And I have done well, haven\u0027t I? Why do you want to punish me?\u0027 Tears, that would never have been there in the Royale days, sparkled in her eyes. She wiped them angrily away with the back of her hand.\n Bond suddenly thought, Hell! I\u0027ll never find another girl like this one. She\u0027s got everything I\u0027ve ever looked for in a woman. She\u0027s beautiful, in bed and out. She\u0027s adventurous, brave, resourceful. She\u0027s exciting always. She seems to love me. She\u0027d let me go on with my life. She\u0027s a lone girl, not cluttered up with friends, relations, belongings. Above all, she needs me. It\u0027ll be someone for me to look after. I\u0027m fed up with all these untidy, casual affairs that leave me with a bad conscience. I wouldn\u0027t mind having children. I\u0027ve got no social background into which she would or wouldn\u0027t fit. We\u0027re two of a pair, really. Why not make it for always?\n Bond found his voice saying those words that he had never said in his life before, never expected to say.\n \u0027Tracy. I love you. Will you marry me?\u0027\n She turned very pale. She looked at him wonderingly. Her lips trembled. \u0027You mean that?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I mean it. With all my heart.\u0027\n She took her hand away from his and put her face in her hands. When she removed them she was smiling. \u0027 I\u0027m sorry, James. It\u0027s so much what I\u0027ve been dreaming of. It came as a shock. But yes. Yes, of course I\u0027ll marry you. And I won\u0027t be silly about it. I won\u0027t make a scene. Just kiss me once and I\u0027ll be going.\u0027 She looked seriously at him, at every detail of his face. Then she leaned forward and they kissed.\n She got up briskly. \u0027I suppose I\u0027ve got to get used to doing what you say. I\u0027ll drive to Munich. To the Vier Jahreszeiten. It\u0027s my favourite hotel in the world. I\u0027ll wait for you there. They know me. They\u0027ll take me in without any luggage. Everything\u0027s at Samaden. I\u0027ll just have to send out for a tooth-brush and stay in bed for two days until I can go out and get some things. You\u0027ll telephone me? Talk to me? When can we get married? I must tell Papa. He\u0027ll be terribly excited.\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s get married in Munich. At the Consulate. I\u0027ve got a kind of diplomatic immunity. I can get the papers through quickly. Then we can be married again in an English church, or Scottish rather. That\u0027s where I come from. I\u0027ll call you up tonight and tomorrow. I\u0027ll get to you just as soon as I can. I\u0027ve got to finish this business first.\u0027\n \u0027You promise you won\u0027t get hurt?\u0027\n Bond smiled. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t think of it. For once I\u0027ll run away if someone starts any shooting.\u0027\n \u0027All right then.\u0027 She looked at him carefully again. \u0027It\u0027s time you took off that red handkerchief. I suppose you realize it\u0027s bitten to ribbons. Give it to me. I\u0027ll mend it.\u0027\n Bond undid the red bandanna from round his neck. It was a dark, sweat-soaked rag. And she was right. Two corners of it were in shreds. He must have got them between his teeth and chewed on them when the going was bad down the mountain. He couldn\u0027t remember having done so. He gave it to her.\n She took it and, without looking back, walked straight out of the restaurant and down the stairs towards the exit.\n Bond sat down. His breakfast came and he began eating mechanically. What had he done? What in hell had he done? But the only answer was a feeling of tremendous warmth and relief and excitement. James and Tracy Bond! Commander and Mrs Bond! How utterly, utterly extraordinary!\n The voice of the Tannoy said, \u0027Attention, please. Passengers on Swissair Flight Number 110 for London, please assemble at gate Number 2. Swissair Flight Number 110 for London. Passengers to gate Number 2, please.\u0027\n Bond stubbed out his cigarette, gave a quick glance round their trysting-place to fix its banality in his mind, and walked to the door, leaving the fragments of his old life torn up amidst the debris of an airport breakfast.\n 20\n M en Pantoufles\n BOND SLEPT in the plane and was visited by a terrible nightmare. It was the hallway of a very grand town-house, an embassy perhaps, and a wide staircase led up under a spangled chandelier to where the butler was standing at the door of the drawing-room, from which came the murmur of a large crowd of guests. Tracy, in oyster satin, was on his arm. She was loaded with jewels and her golden hair had been piled up grandly into one of those fancy arrangements you see in smart hairdressers\u0027 advertisements. On top of the pile was a diamond tiara that glittered gorgeously. Bond was dressed in tails (where in hell had he got those from?), and the wing collar stuck into his neck below the chin. He was wearing his medals, and his order as CMG, on its blue and scarlet ribbon, hung below his white tie. Tracy was chattering, gaily, excitedly, looking forward to the grand evening. Bond was cursing the prospect before him and wishing he was playing a tough game of bridge for high stakes at Blades. They got to the top of the stairs and Bond gave his name.\n \u0027Commander and Mrs James Bond!\u0027 It was the stentorian bellow of a toast-master. Bond got the impression that a sudden hush fell over the elegant crowd in the gilt and white drawing-room.\n He followed Tracy through the double doors. There was a gush of French from Tracy as she exchanged those empty \u0027Mayfair\u0027 kisses, that end up wide of the kissers\u0027 ears, with her hostess. Tracy drew Bond forward. \u0027And this is James. Doesn\u0027t he look sweet with that beautiful medal round his neck? Just like the old De Reszke cigarette advertisements!\u0027\n \u0027Fasten your seat belts, please, and extinguish your cigarettes.\u0027\n Bond awoke, sweating. God Almighty! What had he done? But no! It wouldn\u0027t be like that! Definitely not. He would still have his tough, exciting life, but now there would be Tracy to come home to. Would there be room in his flat in Chelsea? Perhaps he could rent the floor above. And what about May, his Scottish treasure? That would be tricky. He must somehow persuade her to stay.\n The Caravelle hit the runway and there came the roar of jet deflection, and then they were trundling over the tarmac in a light drizzle. Bond suddenly realized that he had no luggage, that he could go straight to Passport Control and then out and back to his flat to change out of these ridiculous skiing clothes that stank of sweat. Would there be a car from the pool for him? There was, with Miss Mary Goodnight sitting beside the driver.\n \u0027My God, Mary, this is a hell of a way to spend your Christmas! This is far beyond the line of duty. Anyway, get in the back and tell me why you\u0027re not stirring the plum pudding or going to church or something.\u0027\n She climbed in to the back seat and he followed. She said, \u0027You don\u0027t seem to know much about Christmas. You make plum puddings at least two months before and let them sort of settle and mature. And church isn\u0027t till eleven.\u0027 She glanced at him. \u0027Actually I came to see how you were. I gather you\u0027ve been in trouble again. You certainly look pretty ghastly. Don\u0027t you own a comb? And you haven\u0027t shaved. You look like a pirate. And\u0027 - she wrinkled her nose -\u0027when did you last have a bath? I wonder they let you out of the airport. You ought to be in quarantine.\u0027\n Bond laughed. \u0027Winter sports are very strenuous - all that snowballing and tobogganing. Matter of fact, I was at a Christmas Eve fancy-dress party last night. Kept me up till all hours.\u0027\n \u0027In those great clod-hopping boots? I don\u0027t believe you.\u0027\n \u0027Well, sucks to you! It was on a skating-rink. But seriously, Mary, tell me the score. Why this VIP treatment?\u0027\n \u0027M. You\u0027re to check with HQ first and then go down to lunch with him at Quarterdeck. Then, after lunch, he\u0027s having these men you wanted brought down for a conference.\n Everything top priority. So I thought I\u0027d better stand by too. As you\u0027re wrecking so many other people\u0027s Christmases, I thought I might as well throw mine on the slag-heap with the others. Actually, if you want to know, I was only having lunch with an aunt. And I loathe turkey and plum pudding. Anyway, I just didn\u0027t want to miss the fun and when the duty officer got on to me about an hour ago and told me there was a major flap, I asked him to tell the car to pick me up on the way to the airport.\u0027\n Bond said seriously, \u0027Well, you\u0027re a damned good girl. As a matter of fact it\u0027s going to be the hell of a rush getting down the bare bones of a report. And I\u0027ve got something for the lab to do. Will there be someone there?\u0027\n \u0027Of course there will. You know M insists on a skeleton staff in every Section, Christmas Day or not. But seriously, James. Have you been in trouble? You really do look awful.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, somewhat. You\u0027ll get the photo as I dictate.\u0027 The car drew up outside Bond\u0027s flat. \u0027Now be an angel and stir up May while I clean myself up and get out of these bloody clothes. Get her to brew me plenty of black coffee and to pour two jiggers of our best brandy into the pot. You ask May for what you like. She might even have some plum pudding. Now then, it\u0027s nine-thirty. Be a good girl and call the Duty Officer and say OK to M\u0027s orders and that we\u0027ll be along by ten-thirty. And get him to ask the lab to stand by in half an hour.\u0027 Bond took his passport out of his hip-pocket. \u0027Then give this to the driver and ask him to get the hell over and give it to the Duty Officer personally. Tell the DO\u0027 - Bond turned down the corner of a page -\u0027to tell the lab that the ink used is - er - home-made. All it needs is exposure to heat. They\u0027ll understand. Got that? Good girl. Now come on and we\u0027ll get May going.\u0027 Bond went up the steps and rang two shorts and a long on the bell.\n When Bond got to his desk a few minutes after ten-thirty, feeling back to nine-tenths human, he found a folder on his desk with the red star in the top right corner that meant\n Top Secret. It contained his passport and a dozen copies of blown-up photostats of its page 21. The list of girls\u0027 names was faint but legible. There was also a note marked \u0027personal\u0027. Bond opened it. He laughed. It just said, \"The ink showed traces of an excess of uric acid. This is often due to a super-abundancy of alcohol in the blood-stream. You have been warned!\u0027 There was no signature. So the Christmas spirit had permeated even into the solemn crevices of one of the most secret Sections in the building! Bond crumpled the paper and then, thinking of Mary Goodnight\u0027s susceptibilities, more prudently burned it with his lighter.\n She came in and sat down with her shorthand book. Bond said, \u0027Now this is only a first draft, Mary, and it\u0027s got to be fast. So don\u0027t mind about mistakes. M\u0027U understand. We\u0027ve got about an hour and a half if I\u0027m to get down to Windsor by lunch-time. Think you can manage it? All right then, here goes. “Top Secret. Personal to M. As instructed, on December 22nd I arrived at Zurich Central Airport at 1330 by Swissair to make first contact in connexion with Operation \u0027Corona\u0027...”\u0027\n Bond turned sideways to his secretary and, as he talked, looked out across the bare trees in Regent\u0027s Park, remembering every minute of the last three days - the sharp, empty smell of the air and the snow, the dark green pools of Blofeld\u0027s eyes, the crunch as the edge of his left hand, still bruised, thudded down across the offered neck of the guard. And then all the rest until Tracy, whom, without mention of romance, he left in his report on her way to the Vier Jahres-zeiten in Munich. Then the report was finished and the muted clack of Mary\u0027s typewriter came from behind the closed door. He would ring Tracy up that night when he got back to his flat. He could already hear her laughing voice at the other end of the wire. The nightmare in the plane was forgotten. Now there was only the happy, secret looking-forward to the days to come. Bond lost himself in his plans -how to get the days off, how to get the necessary papers, where to have the service in Scotland. Then he pulled himself together, picked up the photostat containing the girls\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service-james-bond-11/page-26.html","bookId":1553,"book":{"id":1553,"title":"On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond #11)","description":"Storyline: \n On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (James Bond (Original Series) #11) \n A Lancia Spyder with its hood down tore past him, cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back at him.
