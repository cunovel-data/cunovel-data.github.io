{"id":101893,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"You\u0027re going to what?\" Sarah grabbed my arm as I was about to knock at the door. \"Are you crazy? Oh, what am I saying? You don\u0027t even have a Taser...\"\\n\\n \"No, but I do have a handy little skill that allows me to control lightning.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"You\u0027re going to strike Carol Lee with lightning? That could kill her!\"\\n\\n \"Not if I can control it properly.\" I took a deep breath, pushing aside the doubting thoughts, focusing on what I needed to do. \"A Taser is a device which uses a high-voltage pulse of electricity to momentarily shock its target, thereby disrupting the neurotransmitters, and effectively overloading the nervous system. Carol will be temporarily immobilized, but not permanently harmed.\"\\n\\n Overhead, my little cloud formed. I spread my hands about six inches apart, mentally envisioning a concentrated electrical charge pulled from the surroundings. My fingers began to tingle, the sensation spreading up my arms, reminding me of the time I\u0027d touched a low-voltage electrical fence. Sarah watched with open-mouthed horror as a small blue ball of light formed between my hands. The tingling intensified as the ball shrunk into a small blue orb between my palms.\\n\\n \"Knock on the door,\" I told Sarah, my attention focused on holding the charge where I wanted it.\\n\\n \"Portia - \"\\n\\n \"Please, Sarah. I don\u0027t know what will happen if I stop focusing on this.\"\\n\\n \"I hope to god you know what you\u0027re doing,\" she said, shaking her head, but knocking on the door.\\n\\n It took about sixty seconds, but the door finally opened up a few inches, with Carol Lee\u0027s white, expressionless face visible. \"What do you want?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"The truth,\" I told her, flinging the electrical charge directly at her. Her eyes widened for a moment before the charge zapped her, knocking her backward a few feet.\\n\\n \"I knew it! You\u0027ve killed her!\" Sarah pronounced as I pushed open the door and knelt down by Carol\u0027s supine figure. My hands were shaking as I checked her pulse.\\n\\n \"No, she\u0027s alive. Her pulse is a bit rocky, but fine.\" Carol\u0027s eyes were open, unblinking, and flat. \"Go get the car. We\u0027ll get her into it and restrained before she comes out of this.\"\\n\\n Sarah stood above me, her hands on her hips, a warning note clearly evident in her voice. \"Portia, I never thought the day would come when I\u0027d find you, the most passive of pacifists, disabling and kidnapping an unarmed, innocent woman - \"\\n\\n \"Innocent, my ass. Get the car quick,\" I said, hurrying into the kitchen to look for some twine or duct tape I could use to bind her arms.\\n\\n To my relief, we managed to get Milo\u0027s wife securely bound and bundled into the rental car before she came out of her shocked state. After five minutes of non-stop abuse hurled from where she lay on the backseat, the noise abated once we applied a scarf in the form of a gag. She continued to mumble behind the gag, but, thankfully, it was subdued enough to ignore.\\n\\n \"Where are we going?\" Sarah asked as I returned to my seat after gagging our victim.\\n\\n \"The Court of Divine Blood.\"\\n\\n Sarah made a soundless whistle, saying nothing more but shooting me frequent questioning glances. Silence and occasional outraged gurgles from the backseat filled the car as we drove to the castle. I knew Sarah was as uneasy as I was over the potentially damning act of kidnapping, but I saw no other solution available to me. The silence bore down heavily on me as I ran over a mental checklist, hoping that I hadn\u0027t missed anything important.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think anyone is going to notice this?\" Sarah said twenty minutes later as a huge billow of fog filled the courtyard of the castle.\\n\\n I prodded Milo\u0027s wife forward, ignoring her glare of pure venom, keeping one hand on her wrists bound behind her back. \"I\u0027m sure someone will notice the localized fog, but I don\u0027t really care. It\u0027s difficult enough kidnapping someone - getting them where you want them to go without interference from the public is tantamount to impossible. I\u0027m just taking the easiest way out.\"\\n\\n The fog, my lack of familiarity with the castle, and Carol Lee\u0027s repeated, abortive attempts at escape made it take a good three times the normal amount of time it would have taken to find the room that opened into the portal to the Court, but at last we arrived at our goal.\\n\\n I saw Carol eyeing the windows and grabbed onto her shoulders with both hands, shoving her toward the entrance to the Court.\\n\\n \"Portia, are you sure - \" Sarah started to say, doubt evident on her face as we approached the fuzzy portal.\\n\\n \"Reasonably sure. I\u0027ve examined the evidence and can\u0027t come to any other conclusion. Deep breath, everyone. It\u0027s showtime!\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe the only time I\u0027m visiting heaven is in the pursuit of some crime or other,\" Sarah grumbled as we marched to the center of the town square. The usual business prevailed: people talking in small groups around the center well, the shops doing their brisk trade, other people busily hurrying hither and yon. At the sight of us materializing in the center of their activities, everyone froze.\\n\\n \"Hello, again,\" I said, recognizing a few (albeit startled) faces from the hearing. Theo?\\n\\n An equally startled silence filled my head. Portia? What are you doing in the Court?\\n\\n Doing what you asked - resolving one of our problems. Where are you? I think I\u0027m going to need a little help in getting my prisoner to the mare. The people in the square seem to be stunned into some sort of a fugue state.\\n\\n Theo seemed to share their reaction, at least for a few seconds. Prisoner?\\n\\n Yes. I kidnapped Milo Lee\u0027s wife and brought her here.\\n\\n A soft sigh echoed in my head. Portia, do you have any idea how the Court is going to react to you kidnapping a mortal and bringing her here? As if we weren\u0027t in enough trouble -\\n\\n Carol Lee took advantage of my distraction with Theo to twist herself out of my grip, racing toward the doorway that led back to the land of reality.\\n\\n \"Oh, no you don\u0027t!\" I took a leap that would do a broad jumper proud, flinging myself at Carol, just catching the heel of her shoe as I fell. She went down just as my head cracked the cobblestones, but I didn\u0027t let go of her despite the stars that seemed to weave around in front of me.\\n\\n \"Such an entrance you apparently desire to make,\" a male voice drawled as I got to my knees, shaking my head but keeping a firm grip on Carol\u0027s kicking foot. \"I could almost imagine you were trying to get my attention.\"\\n\\n \"Think again,\" I ground out as I got to my feet, hauling up my still-struggling prisoner.\\n\\n Gabriel the cherub pursed his lips as he eyed first the woman bound with silver-grey duct tape, then me. I blew back a strand of hair that was sticking to my lip, and lifted my chin, trying to look poised and in charge of the situation.\\n\\n \"I see you\u0027ve added abduction to your resume,\" he said, the corners of his mouth crooking upward. \"As if murder wasn\u0027t enough?\"\\n\\n \"Portia didn\u0027t murder anyone,\" Sarah said, coming forward to give me a hand with Carol as she continued to fight her bonds, her eyes wild. \"If you knew her, you\u0027d realize that she\u0027s incapable of something so immoral.\"\\n\\n Carol flung herself backward, her head knocking into mine as she tried to kick my legs out from under me. I sidestepped the back kick, yanking her bound arms up and hissing in her ear in as mean a voice as possible, \"You try that again, and I\u0027ll break both your arms.\"\\n\\n Gabriel\u0027s eyebrows rose.\\n\\n \"There are, naturally, different interpretations on the word \u0027immoral\u0027,\" Sarah said, looking as if she was about to explain the whole circumstance to Gabriel.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t bother trying to make him understand,\" I interrupted. \"Gabriel has his mind already made up about me.\"\\n\\n \"Gabriel?\" Sarah\u0027s face took on an awe-struck cast. \"Gabriel?\"\\n\\n \"Not that Gabriel,\" he said, looking annoyed. \"What is it with you mortals? Is there only one Gabriel you know?\"\\n\\n Sarah nodded, disappointment rife in her eyes.\\n\\n \"This Gabriel is a cherub,\" I said, catching sight of a familiar form skulking along the edge of a building, staying well into the shadows. \"And not a particularly nice one. Come on, Carol, we have a little business with some friends of yours.\"\\n\\n \"I could make a comment about your niceness as well, virtue,\" Gabriel called after us as we left him. \"But I am too much a cherub to do so!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s his problem?\" Sarah asked in a whisper, glancing over her shoulder at him.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a bit pissed that I refused to let him seduce me. Or so I gather - honestly, it could be just about anything. I may have breached some sort of Court etiquette or something, and offended him. I\u0027ve never felt so out of my depths in my life.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.\" Sarah gave me a reassuring pat on the arm. \"Gabriel may be a handsome devil, but he\u0027s no Theo.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed he isn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Theo\u0027s eyes were shaded by the brim of his hat, but I could see the light color of his irises even before I got up close to him.\\n\\n Not a good sign.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d care to explain just why you felt it necessary to kidnap someone when we\u0027re attempting to clear your name of a murder charge?\" Theo asked.\\n\\n \"I told her it wasn\u0027t a good idea,\" Sarah piped in. \"But you know how Portia is - once she has a goal in mind, she moves heaven and earth to achieve it. It must be all that science stuff - she\u0027s so linear in the way she thinks.\"\\n\\n \"She can be,\" Theo said, his gaze darkening into something expressing less displeasure and more thoughtfulness. \"Which leads me to believe that I might owe her an apology after all. It\u0027s been my experience that Portia doesn\u0027t look before leaping, so to speak.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, I will graciously accept your apology. Is there a mare or two around we can speak with? I think they\u0027re going to find Carol very interesting.\"\\n\\n Theo gave the bound woman a long look. Who is this?\\n\\n Milo\u0027s wife, Carol Lee.\\n\\n Theo waited for more. I smiled into his head. Don\u0027t you recognize her? She\u0027s an old friend of yours.\\n\\n His eyes narrowed as he looked her over more closely. She jerked convulsively, trying to break my hold on her bound arms, her eyes all but spitting hatred at us.\\n\\n I knew the instant Theo recognized her. His eyes widened as he took a step toward her.\\n\\n \"I think we should let that wait for the mare,\" I told him. \"Are they in the library, do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea where they are, but we will find out,\" he said, stepping past us, careful not to leave the shade of the building as he hailed a young girl passing on a brightly colored bike. He had a few minutes\u0027 discussion with her, then gestured to us to follow him. \"The messenger says that two of the mare are in the sanctuary.\"\\n\\n Carol flung herself on the ground, shrieking behind her gag. Theo simply hoisted her onto his shoulders and carried her to the area of the Court containing the offices and grand apartments.\\n\\n \"We have an audience,\" Sarah said as we marched along. I glanced back to where she was looking. Just about everyone who had been in the town square was following behind us, with others streaming in to swell their ranks as we proceeded to the other section of the city.\\n\\n This should prove to be interesting, Theo said as we waited for the same dapifer who had taken care of us a few days before to determine if the mare would see us. Added to what I found out while you were so industriously occupied, I believe we may have a solution.\\n\\n Oh, I can\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t ask you about that! Did you talk to Terrin? What did you find out?\\n\\n \"Their graces the mare Irina and mare Disin have granted you an audience,\" the dapifer said, his lips moving soundlessly as he eyeballed the gathered crowd behind us. \"I believe the ballroom will be best. This way, please.\"\\n\\n What did Terrin tell you?\\n\\n Have you ever heard of renascence?\\n\\n Renaissance? Sure.\\n\\n No, renascence. He spelled it for me. The concept is similar to renaissance in that both essentially mean rebirth, but in this instance its usage applies solely to the Court of Divine Blood.\\n\\n In what way? I asked as we were led to an entirely different area of the keep from where we\u0027d been before.\\n\\n It is the method by which the entire Court hierarchy is remade. The sovereign allows one renascence per millennium.\\n\\n What happens to the people who are remade? I asked, my skin crawling as thoughts of concentration camps and ethnic purging danced through my head.\\n\\n They take new positions under the reformed hierarchy. It is not a mass extermination, sweetling...although the results can be nearly as devastating.\\n\\n \"Do we get to see the sovereign?\" Sarah asked in an awe-hushed voice, drawing my attention from the dark path my thoughts had taken.\\n\\n I looked around us as we made our way into the depths of the castle, noticing the surroundings with growing amazement. The word \"grand\" was an understatement when applied to the reception rooms. Rich ebony-edged lapis lazuli furniture jostled for room with crimson and gold chairs, settees, and opulent drapery. The walls looked like something out of an art museum, with objects adorning almost every free space: everything from chunks of rocky walls bearing faded cave paintings, to wooden triptychs depicting the medieval idea of religion scenes, to icons, both old and new.\\n\\n The dapifer leading the way stopped before a pair of rococo double doors. He turned back to us, giving Sarah a frown. \"The sovereign is never seen.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean, never seen?\" Sarah looked confused. \"Not seen without an appointment?\"\\n\\n \"No, I mean that the sovereign is never seen. That is, the sovereign does not appear in the Court of Divine Blood. Their graces are waiting for you,\" he continued, giving Theo and me a nod.\\n\\n \"Wait a second,\" I said, stopping him as he was about to open the door. \"Are you saying that the person running the Court doesn\u0027t bother to put in an appearance once in a while?\"\\n\\n The dapifer\u0027s face reflected mild annoyance. \"The sovereign does not choose to make its physical form known.\"\\n\\n \"How incredibly convenient,\" I said, shaking my head. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" The dapifer\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"Why what?\"\\n\\n \"Why does the sovereign choose to not make its appearance known in the Court, its own home, if I understand the premise correctly. Is it afraid of something?\"\\n\\n The murmur of conversation that had accompanied the crowd following us hushed into a pregnant silence.\\n\\n Portia, you are treading on very thin ice, Theo warned as the dapifer\u0027s eyebrows rose in startled surprise at my question. I urge you to discontinue this line of conversation. It can do no good to you, nor does it have any bearing on our situation.\\n\\n No, but surely I can\u0027t be the only one here to find it more than a little suspicious that the almighty sovereign, the supreme being of everyone here, doesn\u0027t bother to pop in now and again and see how things are going.\\n\\n I turned to the people filling the hallway as far back as the eye could see. \"Doesn\u0027t anyone here wonder about the fact that sovereign has never been seen? Doesn\u0027t anyone question that policy?\"\\n\\n Sweetling, you must stop before this goes further.\\n\\n So free thought isn\u0027t allowed here? Is no one allowed to question the existence of a supreme being that no one has ever seen?\\n\\n The existence of the sovereign is not in doubt by any members of the Court, he answered, and I could feel how carefully he picked his words.\\n\\n \"Is there any empirical proof that the sovereign is even here now?\" I asked, amazed that something so basic had escaped everyone. \"Does no one even wonder if the whole idea of a sovereign is...untrue?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" the dapifer said, his face once again bland and emotionless. \"It is a matter of faith.\"\\n\\n \"Faith? Because you believe the sovereign exists, it follows that such a being must be?\" I shook my head again.\\n\\n Theo turned so Carol\u0027s foot whapped me on the arm. Sweetling, cease. We have more important things to take care of, and you arguing the logic of faith will not help our case.\\n\\n He was right. I had met fanatics before - I\u0027d lived with them for eighteen years - and I knew well that such people were not often open to logic and reason. This would be a battle for another time.\\n\\n Sarah was watching me closely, concern in her eyes. I gave her a weakly reassuring smile and waved a hand at the dapifer. \"Sorry to hold you up. We\u0027re ready if the mare are.\"\\n\\n The dapifer opened both doors with a grand gesture, sweeping in to make a bow to the dais at the far end of the room.\\n\\n \"Hol-ee cow,\" Sarah said, her eyes huge as she spun around looking at the ballroom.\\n\\n I had to admit, it was a pretty impressive sight. The walls were paneled in a warm, amber oak, with two rows of long windows running the entire length of the room. Sunlight poured into the room, leaving bright pools dappling the glossy, polished parquet floor. More pictures were on the walls between the windows, portraits this time, beneath each of which sat a silver and blue upholstered chair.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re going to need a whole lot more chairs than that,\" I said softly as we proceeded into the room, Theo carefully making his way around the pools of sunlight.\\n\\n \"Will you look at those chandeliers?\" Sarah\u0027s mouth hung open just a smidgen as she ogled the ornate silver pieces of art that hung from the ceiling. \"Are those swans in them?\"\\n\\n \"Looks like a whole mythology theme going on in this room,\" I answered, unable to keep from looking at the mural on the ceiling. Although at first I thought it was the sort of allegorical painting one normally found on a castle ballroom ceiling, closer inspection showed elements of mythology rather than religion. Satyrs and fauns romped with sylphlike women clad in gauzy gowns in a sylvan setting, while on the far side of the room, nearest the dais which we were approaching, the scene changed to one of black and red, with figures of leering men, and small brown humanlike beings that I took to be some sort of demon.\\n\\n Clustered to one side, between the woodland paradise and the fiery depths of Abaddon, but part of neither, stood a small cluster of men and women with downcast eyes, their expressions and body language depicting shame and remorse.\\n\\n \"Those are the nephilim,\" Theo said, nodding at them.\\n\\n \"Right. It\u0027s brass-tacks time,\" I said, squaring my shoulders as we stopped in front of the raised dais. Three chairs sat on it, two of which were occupied by the elderly mare named Irina and the acerbic Disin.\\n\\n Theo set the struggling Carol down. I moved around to her far side, keeping a possessive hand on her arm. Theo bowed to the mare. I thought fleetingly of curtseying, but the fact that I had no idea how to perform such a move, coupled with an independent spirit that rejected such notions as someone being \"better\" than me, left me with the decision that a head bob would be sufficient to show respect.\\n\\n \"Good afternoon,\" I said, nodding to both the mares. \"I am sorry to disrupt you without warning, but - \"\\n\\n \"Portia Harding,\" Disin interrupted, her voice booming like thunder as it rolled down the room. People were still filing into the ballroom, but at her bellow they froze, a good half of the large ballroom filled with a solid mass of apparently lifeless bodies. \"You have defied the judgment of the Court of Divine Blood by returning here without first being summoned to do so.\"\\n\\n Theo moved closer to me. Overhead, a small dark cloud formed. I willed it away, taking Theo\u0027s hand instead.\\n\\n \"I am not aware that the hearing you held constituted a legal trial, complete with judgment,\" I said, keeping my voice as non-confrontational, while still firm, as possible. \"As I recall, you ordered us to find the murderer of Hope the virtue by the new moon.\" I waved my hand to the bound woman next to me. \"We have done so.\"\\n\\n The crowd moved forward a few feet. I recognized a few familiar faces: the nameless boy proctor who\u0027d taken me to the Akasha, Gabriel, the messenger Theo had stopped. Probably another two hundred people had joined them, filling half the ballroom. Each and every one of them turned to look at Carol Lee.\\n\\n \"Your cruel and callous treatment of this woman is yet another slap in the Court\u0027s face,\" Disin said, her voice flinty and hard-edged. \"Release her immediately.\"\\n\\n \"I realize that kidnapping someone is an extreme action, and one I do not undertake lightly. However, given the circumstances, there was no alternative. I could not have convinced her to come to the Court on her own. If I release her now, she will simply escape.\"\\n\\n The crowd made murmurs of disbelief. Disin drew herself up until she seemed a good three feet taller than normal.\\n\\n It began to snow inside the ballroom.\\n\\n \"Your impertinence is beyond all bounds. Release that woman immediately, or I will have you jailed for contempt.\"\\n\\n She looks mean enough to do it, I muttered to Theo as I pulled out a small pair of nail scissors from my purse. Keep an eye on Carol. She\u0027s going to bolt the second I have her hands free, I just know it.\\n\\n Have a little more faith in the security of the Court, sweetling. Despite appearances, the mare will not allow anyone to leave if they do not desire it.\\n\\n I cut the duct tape on Carol\u0027s wrists while Theo untied the gag. The second her hands were free, she attacked me, knocking me down to the ground, both hands clutching my hair while she banged my head on the ground.\\n\\n Theo pulled her off me while Disin yelled for order.\\n\\n \"I told you,\" I said softly as Sarah helped me up to my feet.\\n\\n \"There will be order,\" Disin yelled, her hands gesticulating wildly toward us. \"You will, all of you, display the respect due the Court, or I will take such measures as to ensure you will not darken our presence again!\"\\n\\n As a threat, it had sufficient punch to calm Carol down. She jerked her arm out of Theo\u0027s grip, but limited herself to a couple of murderous looks my way.\\n\\n The snow moved to fall only on Carol.\\n\\n \"You will cease with such unseemly dramatics,\" Disin ordered, pointing at me.\\n\\n \"I would if I could, but I don\u0027t seem to have a very good grasp on weather control,\" I said.\\n\\n Irina shook her head, her all-seeing eyes on me. \"Child, child. This is not worthy of you.\"\\n\\n I cleared my throat as a little blush warmed my cheeks. \"I hope that once I am formally accepted as a virtue, I\u0027ll be able to learn how to control the weather effects a little better.\"\\n\\n Sweetling, you will never be an actress.\\n\\n I smiled at the soft brush of Theo\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \"Such an event is not yet in your grasp,\" Disin answered with a distinct threat in her voice. \"Nor will it be, if your present actions continue.\"\\n\\n I made an effort to dismiss the cloud, arranging my expression to be something a little less antagonistic, folding my hands together and waiting for Disin to continue.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m so sorry, I\u0027m late I know, but I was held up in the mortal world. Goodness, is it snowing? How interesting.\" Suria, the third mare, pushed her way through the crowd, giving the snow-covered Carol an interested look before taking her seat on the dais. \"What have I missed?\"\\n\\n \"Portia Harding has effected an act of violence against an outsider, and brought her to the Court without either permission or the knowledge of the mare.\" Disin\u0027s glance flickered over to Sarah for a second. \"Two outsiders. Such an inconsiderate disregard for the laws of the Court of Divine Blood is not to be tolerated!\"\\n\\n \"Portia has little knowledge of Court etiquette and laws,\" Theo said, moving closer to me. \"We ask your graces to show the leniency for which you are so well known in regards to her accidental violations.\"\\n\\n \"Accidental?\" Disin asked, her face tightening. \"Do you consider kidnapping a woman accidental?\"\\n\\n \"It would, perhaps, be prudent to allow Portia Harding to explain her reasons for conducting such an...extreme act,\" Irina said softly.\\n\\n Suria nodded, her normally sunny face pinched and worried. \"I will confess that I, too, am curious as to why Portia would go to such lengths. Who exactly is this woman you have abducted?\"\\n\\n \"She goes by the name of Carol Lee, and is wife to Milo, who conducted the fourth trial.\"\\n\\n Immediately, a buzz of conversation started up behind me.\\n\\n \"And you say that she is responsible for the death of the virtue Hope?\" Suria asked.\\n\\n \"In a manner of speaking, yes.\" I slid a glance toward Theo. His face was expressionless, but his warm presence gave me much comfort.\\n\\n Go ahead, sweetling.\\n\\n You speak with much more of a Court flair than I do. Maybe you should be the one to explain.\\n\\n No. The honor goes to you. You figured it out - you should be the one to explain.\\n\\n \"You will explain your actions, child,\" Irina said in her soft voice. The undertone of steel was enough to warn me that she wasn\u0027t going to be supportive if I didn\u0027t offer up enough proof.\\n\\n \"What do you mean, in a manner of speaking?\" Disin asked, her words lashing the air with whiplike accuracy. \"Did she kill Hope or not?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n The buzz grew in volume.\\n\\n I raised my voice to be heard over it. \"She did not kill Hope for the simple fact that she is Hope.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-of-the-red-hot-vampires-dark-ones-5/page-21.html","bookId":2206,"book":{"id":2206,"title":"The Last of the Red Hot Vampires (Dark Ones #5)","description":"Storyline: The Last of the Red-Hot Vampires (Dark Ones #5) \\n Physicist Portia Harding’s life is grounded in facts.
