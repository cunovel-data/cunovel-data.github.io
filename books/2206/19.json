{"id":101891,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"I\u0027m in so much trouble.\" The hum of the air-conditioning in the car was the only noise. \"I wonder how much groveling it\u0027s going to take to get the mare to give me another shot at that trial?\" Outside the window, gulls cried overhead. I flinched as we passed the area where earlier we\u0027d skidded off the road, averting my eyes from the sight of Theo\u0027s car, still half-buried in the mountain of oyster shells. \"I hope your car will be all right. When are they coming to tow it?\" \"Soon.\" I sighed, slinking down into my seat. Are you still mad at me? I have not been mad at you, so there is no \"still\" to it. Then why aren\u0027t you talking to me? You haven\u0027t said a word since we went back to the pub so I could take a shower and change. I know you have to be angry, or at least disappointed, that I\u0027ve messed up the trial so much that I won\u0027t be a virtue, and won\u0027t be able to pardon you, but I really don\u0027t believe the situation is as hopeless as you no doubt think it is. I don\u0027t think anything is hopeless, sweetling, nor am I in the least bit angry. I think you showed remarkable restraint in not acting rashly with Leticia. I know how much you wanted to treat her in kind. \"Can I ask a question?\" Sarah leaned forward so she could be heard in the front seat of the car she\u0027d rented for our trip, now serving as our primary mode of transportation while Theo\u0027s car was out of commission. \"Since I\u0027m delighted to know you\u0027re still talking to me, by all means, ask away.\" \"I wasn\u0027t not talking to you, silly. I was taking notes on what happened. This is so incredibly fascinating!\" \"I\u0027m glad someone is getting enjoyment out of it. What was your question?\" \"Why are we going to the Court if you\u0027re now out of the running as a virtue?\" A headache was building behind my forehead. I rubbed it, not for the first time, wishing I could rewind my life and start this section over. \"Because I\u0027m hoping that if I bring proof to the mare of what happened to Hope, they will excuse the last trial and give me another shot at it.\" \"Yes, but if you\u0027re no longer a virtue, how are you going to make with the fog?\" I glanced at Theo. His jaw was tight, his eyes a light grey that indicated he was not a happy camper. \"Evidently, even though I failed the three trials, I am not de-virtued until someone strips the power from me.\" \"I hope so, otherwise you\u0027ll be in even hotter water than you are. So, we\u0027re just walking in the front door?\" \"There is more than one entrance to the Court,\" Theo answered. \"We will take the one nearest the library, so Portia\u0027s talents won\u0027t be overly taxed.\" \"Good thinking.\" Sarah sat back to make a few more notes. I spent the rest of the way to the castle mentally sorting the events of the last few days, looking for something we might have missed. I had an uneasy feeling that something significant had happened that I\u0027d failed to acknowledge, but a quick survey of the last three days didn\u0027t come up with anything to assuage my uneasiness. \"Someone is bound to notice this fog isn\u0027t normal,\" I murmured to Theo forty minutes later, as we stopped just beyond a small doorway cut into the stone wall that surrounded the Court. Ahead of us stood the building we\u0027d visited earlier, the library where the Akashic Record was held. \"We will be gone before they can trace the source.\" Theo\u0027s voice was muffled, oddly contorted through the heavy fog that now rolled through the area surrounding the library. Even though he was just a few feet away from me, I could barely see his silhouette. \"Just a little more, sweetling, then we can go in.\" \"I resent being put on watchdog duty,\" Sarah hissed from somewhere behind us. \"I won\u0027t be able to see anyone until they are right on top of me.\" \"No one knows who you are,\" I whispered back, taking Theo\u0027s arm. His fingers closed around mine, reassuringly warm and strong. \"All you have to do is distract anyone who comes to the door. It\u0027s not rocket science, Sarah.\" \"Hrmph.\" Theo guided us to the main doors of the library, opening them wide. I summoned more fog, and sent it into the building, thick white rolls of it slowly filling all available space. We crept along the now-fogged hallways, hands outstretched to avoid colliding with obstacles. There were a few exclamations of surprise from people who found themselves caught in the fog, one person shouting for someone to find the mare. We don\u0027t have much time, Theo said. I clutched the back of his shirt, my other hand holding Sarah\u0027s arm, so we wouldn\u0027t get separated. I know. \"Sarah, this is the doorway to the archives. Stand here and keep anyone from coming in.\" \"Will do.\" I released her arm and followed Theo into a small, dusty-smelling room, shutting the door behind me to keep the fog out. Theo flipped on a light switch, and stood considering the cases around us. The room was, thankfully, empty of people. \"We can split up and search for it,\" I said, moving to the nearest glass archive case. \"What does it look like?\" \"I have no idea, but since it is one of the most valuable records in existence, I assume it will be found in one of the more elaborate cases.\" I quickly examined the books contained in the climate-controlled case in front of me, but nothing had a title even remotely similar to Akashic Record. I skirted a giant library-sized dictionary opened on a book pedestal, and started for the next case. Something tickled at the back of my head. I looked back at the dictionary, giving it a closer examination. Ofaniel, also known as sefira Wisdom. Primary residence: Court of Divine Blood, Grand Apartments, second floor. Mundane residence: Marseille, France. Mundane name: Clementine Massier. Oglien, demon third class, servant of Bael, twenty-second legion. Mundane residence: none. Mundane names: Will O\u0027Bannon, William Bannock, Will the Decapitator. I closed the dictionary to read the title. The Akashic Record: Being a List of All Immortals Possessing Membership in the Court of Divine Blood and Abaddon. \"Theo, I found it. It\u0027s very large.\" He hurried over, frowning slightly. \"They keep it out here in the open?\" \"Evidently. I thought it was a dictionary. F, G, H...ah. Here it is: Hope, originally internuncio, later designed virtue by request of holder. Primary residence: Court of Divine Blood, Grand Apartments, third floor. Mundane residence: Seaton. Seaton?\" I looked up at Theo. \"That\u0027s near Newton Poppleford.\" \"That would explain why she was around the faery ring, then. Mundane name: Hope Campbell. Is that ink blotch covering another name, do you think, or is it just a blot?\" Theo bent over the book, squinting at the black area next to Hope\u0027s name. \"It\u0027s hard to tell. It could be either.\" \"Hmm. I\u0027m willing to bet she covered up her mortal-world name on purpose.\" \"She could have.\" Theo looked thoughtful as he tapped his chin. \"If she thought she was in danger, she might have destroyed any proof of her name as a safety precaution.\" \"That\u0027s lovely. Is there anywhere else we can go to find out what name she is using now?\" I asked, miffed that our lead had fizzled out. \"Not that I know of.\" I sighed. \"Well, at least we have one of her names and a town to go on.\" \"Indeed you do. That was very clever of you to think of consulting the Akashic Record.\" I spun around at the sound of a man\u0027s voice coming from the doorway. Terrin leaned against the door, a slight smile on his face. \"I particularly liked the fog. Very effective. Hello again. Is that your friend guarding the other side of the door?\" \"Yes, she is. She wasn\u0027t supposed to let anyone in,\" I said, trying to come up with an excuse for being in the Court when I\u0027d been forbidden entrance. \"Good morning,\" Theo said, giving Terrin a little bow. \"You have us at a disadvantage. It is somewhat disconcerting to be caught breaking and entering into the Court.\" Terrin\u0027s smile widened. \"And yet you managed it with such ease. A very admirable feat.\" \"Is my friend all right?\" I asked, a bit nervous about Sarah. \"She is right where you left her. I\u0027m afraid I had to obscure her vision for a moment or two while I slipped past her, but she is unharmed.\" I relaxed a little bit. I was willing to take responsibility for my own actions, but I hated for anyone else to suffer on my behalf. \"I suppose you\u0027d like to know why we\u0027re here when we were told to leave.\" \"I assume your purpose is two-fold: to consult the Akashic Record, and to conduct your final trial.\" Terrin strolled over to the window, looking out at the still-dense fog. \"Yes, a very clever use of your Gift. Quite effective.\" Theo and I exchanged glances. \"You\u0027re partially correct: We did come here to see the Akashic Record. But as for my trials...well, even if I hadn\u0027t been disqualified, I would only have been on trial number four, not seven.\" \"No, that cannot be correct.\" Terrin frowned, walking over to a desk on the other side of the room and sitting down to access the computer there. \"You have completed all the trials but the last one, I\u0027m quite sure.\" \"I\u0027m afraid not. Trial number four got put off. I skipped ahead to five, which I did when I was in the Akasha. The two women who did my first trial came back earlier this morning for the fourth trial, but I...er...I failed it.\" \"How very odd.\" Terrin\u0027s fingers tapped out a few words on the computer\u0027s keyboard. He perused the resulting screen, a puzzled look in his eyes. \"That\u0027s not what it says here. According to the official records, you have completed all trials but the last one: four of them successfully, two failures.\" \"How could I pass the fourth and sixth trials? I didn\u0027t do them!\" \"What elements did the fourth and sixth trials test?\" Theo asked, looking even more thoughtful. Terrin consulted the monitor. \"The fourth was logic, the sixth grace.\" \"Now I know your records are at fault. I was the least graceful person alive this morning,\" I said, shuddering at the memory of my muck-covered self. \"Grace,\" Theo repeated, his eyes on me. Why are you looking at me like that? I was thinking that grace doesn\u0027t necessarily indicate physical adeptness. Perhaps it is another type of grace for which you were being tested. What other sort of grace is there? I asked. A blessing? No, I was thinking more the quality of forgiveness, or mercy, if you will. Mercy? To whom have I been merciful?... A vision rose in my mind of Dame Margaret taunting me, baiting me to throw her into the mud. I hadn\u0027t given in to that almost overwhelming desire, though. I\u0027d walked away from her with as much dignity as I could muster. \"I didn\u0027t throw her in the mud,\" I said slowly. \"You did not. You demonstrated grace sufficient to pass the sixth trial,\" Terrin said. \"So Leticia deliberately caused that accident, arranged it so I would be put into a position where I was covered head to toe in the worst sort of muck, then baited me to see if I would retaliate?\" I nodded. In an odd sort of way, it made sense. \"That explains the sixth trial, but not the fourth one. I haven\u0027t done it at all.\" \"According to this, the trial was conducted last night at\" - Terrin peered at the screen - \"ten minutes to midnight. You successfully completed the trial seven minutes later. That was rather pushing it as far as time goes, but all ended well.\" \"That can\u0027t be right,\" I said, shaking my head. \"Last night at midnight I was in a haunted mill, watching my friend and a ghost hunting group as they examined the building. There was no logic trial...\" Goose bumps crawled up my arms. \"Didn\u0027t you say you played a logic game with someone last night, while you were waiting for Sarah?\" Theo asked. \"Milo,\" I said, more confused than ever. \"Milo gave me one of those logic puzzles to solve, but it wasn\u0027t a trial. Milo is a person, a normal person, not someone from the Court...\" My voice trailed away again as Theo and I both turned to look at the large book sitting on the dictionary stand. Theo beat me to it, hurriedly thumbing through the book as I peered over his shoulder. \"Milo, originally archon, later banished from the Court of Divine Blood for abuses of power,\" Theo read. \"Cleared of charges, and removed to vessel of mortality at request of mare Irina. Mundane residence: Newberry, England. Mundane names: Milo Lee, Miles Leighton. Miles Leighton is the man I was trying to find last night, the one who had disappeared, the man who is known to be one of Hope\u0027s friends, and supposedly the one she sought shelter with.\" \"This is wild. Milo is a...a...\" \"Vessel,\" Theo said grimly, his jaw tight. \"In other words, a servant to mortals.\" \"Ha! That\u0027s what he meant about being in customer service. He deliberately hid his connection with the Court from me. But why?\" \"I think it\u0027s time we had a few words with him to find that answer, and a few others as well.\" \"Agreed. Er...\" I glanced over to where Terrin sat watching us, a pleasant expression on his face. \"Hello there. I wondered when you\u0027d remember me.\" \"We hadn\u0027t forgotten,\" Theo said slowly, eyeing Terrin. \"I\u0027m curious as to why you haven\u0027t raised the alarm about us, though. And why, for that matter, are you here now?\" \"Life possesses so many questions, doesn\u0027t it?\" Terrin leaned back in his chair, his hands behind his head. \"Since I am a tidy person by nature, I will answer those I can. I am here, my good nephilim, because this is one of my offices - I have three. And I have not turned you in because I am one of those people who are somewhat offensively labeled cockeyed optimists. A reverse Cassandra, if you will - rather than no one believing what I say, I believe most of what people tell me.\" \"You believe I didn\u0027t have anything to do with Hope\u0027s disappearance?\" He nodded. \"It\u0027s been my experience that life is often full of irony. Your story is very ironic, thus I am inclined to believe that you inadvertently summoned Hope just as you described, that she bequeathed her Gift to you without your knowing it, and that you subsequently not only accepted these facts, but determined to triumph over the adversities that have met you face-to-face.\" I slumped into a chair, relief easing my jangled nerves. \"Then you\u0027ll help us find Hope?\" \"Oh no, that would be quite unacceptable.\" His lips quirked. \"Giving aid to someone banned from the Court would be a serious matter involving repercussions I would prefer to avoid.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to sound so selfish. Of course we don\u0027t want you to get into trouble on our behalf - \" \"I am, however, willing to risk the censure that might follow should the blind eye I\u0027m about to turn to your presence here be found out.\" \"Portia? I think you both had better get a move on. I just heard someone say that the mare were on their way over to investigate the odd fog.\" Sarah\u0027s voice was hushed and muffled as she opened the door a smidgen to speak to us. \"On our way.\" I stood and offered my hand to Terrin. He looked surprised for a moment, then rose and shook it. \"Thank you for believing us.\" \"And thank you for not turning us in,\" Theo added, giving Terrin a wary look. \"It has been my pleasure. I do hope you find the answers that you seek.\" We slipped out of the door, leaving Terrin standing in the middle of the room, a benign expression on his face. Outside the room, the fog was beginning to thin. I concentrated a moment on bringing it back to full denseness, but it continued to disperse despite my efforts. \"Something wrong?\" Theo asked as we hurried down the hallway, averting our faces whenever a foggy figure loomed up. \"Are you not able to control this any longer?\" \"No, I\u0027m not. Let\u0027s get out of here before it\u0027s gone completely.\" We made it to the side entrance of the Court without being seen, but rather than follow Sarah and me through the door to a dank, empty subbasement in the castle, Theo stopped and looked back through to the stone wall that represented the outer boundary of the Court. \"Theo? Shouldn\u0027t we get out of Dodge while the getting is good?\" \"We\u0027re safe here for a minute or two. Have you ever felt as if you were being manipulated?\" he asked, turning toward me. \"Frequently. I\u0027m a woman in a traditionally male-dominated workplace. I\u0027m always being manipulated into taking less-than-desirable projects, or taking on extra work, or covering for someone when I\u0027d rather not - it\u0027s part of the job, unfortunately. Do you think someone is manipulating us now?\" \"I\u0027m not sure. It just seems to me...\" He frowned at the door. \"I am going back. You and Sarah take the car back to the pub.\" \"No!\" I said, unhappy with the thought of separating. \"You can\u0027t go back in there!\" \"Sweetling, I haven\u0027t survived as long as I have by being reckless. I know a thing or two about getting around unseen.\" He gave me a quick kiss and turned back to the door. I grabbed his arm to stop him. \"My fog is gone. You can\u0027t stealth around the Court in full daylight!\" \"It\u0027ll be no different than running from a building to the car. I have my hat - I\u0027ll be careful.\" \"Fine, if you insist on going, then we\u0027ll go with you. Let me yell for Sarah - \" \"No, I will do this alone. You two go ahead without me.\" \"Why?\" I asked, hurt by his exclusion. He took my face in his hands, kissing the frown between my brows. \"Because there is a slight, a very slight, chance I will be caught. The Court can do nothing to me, but you have too much to lose to risk visiting there again. I will speak with Terrin, then leave immediately.\" \"We just talked to him. Why do you want to see him again?\" His eyes were a light shale grey. \"Because I dislike being made to act the puppet, and I think he knows who\u0027s behind that feeling. Portia, you must trust me - I am not going to put myself or you at risk. I simply want to ask a few more questions.\" \"But - \" \"Go,\" he said, giving me a push toward the door that led out of the subbasement. \"I will be with you shortly.\" \"And just how do you expect to get back if we take the car?\" I asked, my hands on my hips. Theo could be the most fabulous man alive, but he was also one of the most frustrating. \"There\u0027s a magical thing known as a taxi,\" he answered, his lips curling into a smile. \"You just call them up, and they take you to wherever you wish to go.\" \"Oh, very funny. Fine. Go off on your own on mysterious errands, and don\u0027t include me. See if I care, you incredibly annoying man!\" I love you, too, he said, his laughter soft in my mind as I made my way up out of the bowels of the castle. \"If he wants to be that way,\" I said, slamming the car door shut on the questions Sarah had been peppering me with as we left the castle, \"then so be it. We\u0027ll just go ahead and solve the whole thing while he\u0027s off doing his lone-wolf act.\" \"Atta girl,\" Sarah replied, pulling a U-turn to get us onto the road back to our town. \"What\u0027s next?\" I pulled out the packet of maps given to us by the local auto association. \"I believe a little visit to the town of Newberry is in order.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-of-the-red-hot-vampires-dark-ones-5/page-19.html","bookId":2206,"book":{"id":2206,"title":"The Last of the Red Hot Vampires (Dark Ones #5)","description":"Storyline: The Last of the Red-Hot Vampires (Dark Ones #5) Physicist Portia Harding’s life is grounded in facts.
