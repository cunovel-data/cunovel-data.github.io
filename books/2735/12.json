{"id":81151,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"“MOM, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!” I shouted, and she came to the bed and let me hug her.\\n\\n I texted Augustus because I knew he was in school:\\n\\n Still free May three? :-)\\n\\n He texted back immediately.\\n\\n Everything’s coming up Waters.\\n\\n If I could just stay alive for a week, I’d know the unwritten secrets of Anna’s mom and the Dutch Tulip Guy. I looked down my blouse at my chest.\\n\\n “Keep your shit together,” I whispered to my lungs.\\n\\n CHAPTER NINE\\n\\n The day before we left for Amsterdam, I went back to Support Group for the first time since meeting Augustus. The cast had rotated a bit down there in the Literal Heart of Jesus. I arrived early, enough time for perennially strong appendiceal cancer survivor Lida to bring me up-to-date on everyone as I ate a grocery-store chocolate chip cookie while leaning against the dessert table.\\n\\n Twelve-year-old leukemic Michael had passed away. He’d fought hard, Lida told me, as if there were another way to fight. Everyone else was still around. Ken was NEC after radiation. Lucas had relapsed, and she said it with a sad smile and a little shrug, the way you might say an alcoholic had relapsed.\\n\\n A cute, chubby girl walked over to the table and said hi to Lida, then introduced herself to me as Susan. I didn’t know what was wrong with her, but she had a scar extending from the side of her nose down her lip and across her cheek. She had put makeup over the scar, which only served to emphasize it. I was feeling a little out of breath from all the standing, so I said, “I’m gonna go sit,” and then the elevator opened, revealing Isaac and his mom. He wore sunglasses and clung to his mom’s arm with one hand, a cane in the other.\\n\\n “Support Group Hazel not Monica,” I said when he got close enough, and he smiled and said, “Hey, Hazel. How’s it going?”\\n\\n “Good. I’ve gotten really hot since you went blind.”\\n\\n “I bet,” he said. His mom led him to a chair, kissed the top of his head, and shuffled back toward the elevator. He felt around beneath him and then sat. I sat down in the chair next to him. “So how’s it going?”\\n\\n “Okay. Glad to be home, I guess. Gus told me you were in the ICU?”\\n\\n “Yeah,” I said.\\n\\n “Sucks,” he said.\\n\\n “I’m a lot better now,” I said. “I’m going to Amsterdam tomorrow with Gus.”\\n\\n “I know. I’m pretty well up-to-date on your life, because Gus never. Talks. About. Anything. Else.”\\n\\n I smiled. Patrick cleared his throat and said, “If we could all take a seat?” He caught my eye. “Hazel!” he said. “I’m so glad to see you!”\\n\\n Everyone sat and Patrick began his retelling of his ball-lessness, and I fell into the routine of Support Group: communicating through sighs with Isaac, feeling sorry for everyone in the room and also everyone outside of it, zoning out of the conversation to focus on my breathlessness and the aching. The world went on, as it does, without my full participation, and I only woke up from the reverie when someone said my name.\\n\\n It was Lida the Strong. Lida in remission. Blond, healthy, stout Lida, who swam on her high school swim team. Lida, missing only her appendix, saying my name, saying, “Hazel is such an inspiration to me; she really is. She just keeps fighting the battle, waking up every morning and going to war without complaint. She’s so strong. She’s so much stronger than I am. I just wish I had her strength.”\\n\\n “Hazel?” Patrick asked. “How does that make you feel?”\\n\\n I shrugged and looked over at Lida. “I’ll give you my strength if I can have your remission.” I felt guilty as soon as I said it.\\n\\n “I don’t think that’s what Lida meant,” Patrick said. “I think she . . .” But I’d stopped listening.\\n\\n After the prayers for the living and the endless litany of the dead (with Michael tacked on to the end), we held hands and said, “Living our best life today!”\\n\\n Lida immediately rushed up to me full of apology and explanation, and I said, “No, no, it’s really fine,” waving her off, and I said to Isaac, “Care to accompany me upstairs?”\\n\\n He took my arm, and I walked with him to the elevator, grateful to have an excuse to avoid the stairs. I’d almost made it all the way to the elevator when I saw his mom standing in a corner of the Literal Heart. “I’m here,” she said to Isaac, and he switched from my arm to hers before asking, “You want to come over?”\\n\\n “Sure,” I said. I felt bad for him. Even though I hated the sympathy people felt toward me, I couldn’t help but feel it toward him.\\n\\n Isaac lived in a small ranch house in Meridian Hills next to this fancy private school. We sat down in the living room while his mom went off to the kitchen to make dinner, and then he asked if I wanted to play a game.\\n\\n “Sure,” I said. So he asked for the remote. I gave it to him, and he turned on the TV and then a computer attached to it. The TV screen stayed black, but after a few seconds a deep voice spoke from it.\\n\\n “Deception,” the voice said. “One player or two?”\\n\\n “Two,” Isaac said. “Pause.” He turned to me. “I play this game with Gus all the time, but it’s infuriating because he is a completely suicidal video-game player. He’s, like, way too aggressive about saving civilians and whatnot.”\\n\\n “Yeah,” I said, remembering the night of the broken trophies.\\n\\n “Unpause,” Isaac said.\\n\\n “Player one, identify yourself.”\\n\\n “This is player one’s sexy sexy voice,” Isaac said.\\n\\n “Player two, identify yourself.”\\n\\n “I would be player two, I guess,” I said.\\n\\n Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem and Private Jasper Jacks awake in a dark, empty room approximately twelve feet square.\\n\\n Isaac pointed toward the TV, like I should talk to it or something. “Um,” I said. “Is there a light switch?”\\n\\n No.\\n\\n “Is there a door?”\\n\\n Private Jacks locates the door. It is locked.\\n\\n Isaac jumped in. “There’s a key above the door frame.”\\n\\n Yes, there is.\\n\\n “Mayhem opens the door.”\\n\\n The darkness is still complete.\\n\\n “Take out knife,” Isaac said.\\n\\n “Take out knife,” I added.\\n\\n A kid—Isaac’s brother, I assume—darted out from the kitchen. He was maybe ten, wiry and overenergetic, and he kind of skipped across the living room before shouting in a really good imitation of Isaac’s voice, “KILL MYSELF.”\\n\\n Sergeant Mayhem places his knife to his neck. Are you sure you—\\n\\n “No,” Isaac said. “Pause. Graham, don’t make me kick your ass.” Graham laughed giddily and skipped off down a hallway.\\n\\n As Mayhem and Jacks, Isaac and I felt our way forward in the cavern until we bumped into a guy whom we stabbed after getting him to tell us that we were in a Ukrainian prison cave, more than a mile beneath the ground. As we continued, sound effects—a raging underground river, voices speaking in Ukrainian and accented English—led you through the cave, but there was nothing to see in this game. After playing for an hour, we began to hear the cries of a desperate prisoner, pleading, “God, help me. God, help me.”\\n\\n “Pause,” Isaac said. “This is when Gus always insists on finding the prisoner, even though that keeps you from winning the game, and the only way to actually free the prisoner is to win the game.”\\n\\n “Yeah, he takes video games too seriously,” I said. “He’s a bit too enamored with metaphor.”\\n\\n “Do you like him?” Isaac asked.\\n\\n “Of course I like him. He’s great.”\\n\\n “But you don’t want to hook up with him?”\\n\\n I shrugged. “It’s complicated.”\\n\\n “I know what you’re trying to do. You don’t want to give him something he can’t handle. You don’t want him to Monica you,” he said.\\n\\n “Kinda,” I said. But it wasn’t that. The truth was, I didn’t want to Isaac him. “To be fair to Monica,” I said, “what you did to her wasn’t very nice either.”\\n\\n “What’d I do to her?” he asked, defensive.\\n\\n “You know, going blind and everything.”\\n\\n “But that’s not my fault,” Isaac said.\\n\\n “I’m not saying it was your fault. I’m saying it wasn’t nice.”\\n\\n CHAPTER TEN\\n\\n We could only take one suitcase. I couldn’t carry one, and Mom insisted that she couldn’t carry two, so we had to jockey for space in this black suitcase my parents had gotten as a wedding present a million years ago, a suitcase that was supposed to spend its life in exotic locales but ended up mostly going back and forth to Dayton, where Morris Property, Inc., had a satellite office that Dad often visited.\\n\\n I argued with Mom that I should have slightly more than half of the suitcase, since without me and my cancer, we’d never be going to Amsterdam in the first place. Mom countered that since she was twice as large as me and therefore required more physical fabric to preserve her modesty, she deserved at least two-thirds of the suitcase.\\n\\n In the end, we both lost. So it goes.\\n\\n Our flight didn’t leave until noon, but Mom woke me up at five thirty, turning on the light and shouting, “AMSTERDAM!” She ran around all morning making sure we had international plug adapters and quadruple-checking that we had the right number of oxygen tanks to get there and that they were all full, etc., while I just rolled out of bed, put on my Travel to Amsterdam Outfit (jeans, a pink tank top, and a black cardigan in case the plane was cold).\\n\\n The car was packed by six fifteen, whereupon Mom insisted that we eat breakfast with Dad, although I had a moral opposition to eating before dawn on the grounds that I was not a nineteenth-century Russian peasant fortifying myself for a day in the fields. But anyway, I tried to stomach down some eggs while Mom and Dad enjoyed these homemade versions of Egg McMuffins they liked.\\n\\n “Why are breakfast foods breakfast foods?” I asked them. “Like, why don’t we have curry for breakfast?”\\n\\n “Hazel, eat.”\\n\\n “But why?” I asked. “I mean, seriously: How did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity? You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out. But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it’s a breakfast sandwich.”\\n\\n Dad answered with his mouth full. “When you come back, we’ll have breakfast for dinner. Deal?”\\n\\n “I don’t want to have ‘breakfast for dinner,’” I answered, crossing knife and fork over my mostly full plate. “I want to have scrambled eggs for dinner without this ridiculous construction that a scrambled egg–inclusive meal is breakfast even when it occurs at dinnertime.”\\n\\n “You’ve gotta pick your battles in this world, Hazel,” my mom said. “But if this is the issue you want to champion, we will stand behind you.”\\n\\n “Quite a bit behind you,” my dad added, and Mom laughed.\\n\\n Anyway, I knew it was stupid, but I felt kind of bad for scrambled eggs.\\n\\n After they finished eating, Dad did the dishes and walked us to the car. Of course, he started crying, and he kissed my cheek with his wet stubbly face. He pressed his nose against my cheekbone and whispered, “I love you. I’m so proud of you.” (For what, I wondered.)\\n\\n “Thanks, Dad.”\\n\\n “I’ll see you in a few days, okay, sweetie? I love you so much.”\\n\\n “I love you, too, Dad.” I smiled. “And it’s only three days.”\\n\\n As we backed out of the driveway, I kept waving at him. He was waving back, and crying. It occurred to me that he was probably thinking he might never see me again, which he probably thought every single morning of his entire weekday life as he left for work, which probably sucked.\\n\\n Mom and I drove over to Augustus’s house, and when we got there, she wanted me to stay in the car to rest, but I went to the door with her anyway. As we approached the house, I could hear someone crying inside. I didn’t think it was Gus at first, because it didn’t sound anything like the low rumble of his speaking, but then I heard a voice that was definitely a twisted version of his say, “BECAUSE IT IS MY LIFE, MOM. IT BELONGS TO ME.” And quickly my mom put her arm around my shoulders and spun me back toward the car, walking quickly, and I was like, “Mom, what’s wrong?”\\n\\n And she said, “We can’t eavesdrop, Hazel.”\\n\\n We got back into the car and I texted Augustus that we were outside whenever he was ready.\\n\\n We stared at the house for a while. The weird thing about houses is that they almost always look like nothing is happening inside of them, even though they contain most of our lives. I wondered if that was sort of the point of architecture.\\n\\n “Well,” Mom said after a while, “we are pretty early, I guess.”\\n\\n “Almost as if I didn’t have to get up at five thirty,” I said. Mom reached down to the console between us, grabbed her coffee mug, and took a sip. My phone buzzed. A text from Augustus.\\n\\n Just CAN’T decide what to wear. Do you like me better in a polo or a button-down?\\n\\n I replied:\\n\\n Button-down.\\n\\n Thirty seconds later, the front door opened, and a smiling Augustus appeared, a roller bag behind him. He wore a pressed sky-blue button-down tucked into his jeans. A Camel Light dangled from his lips. My mom got out to say hi to him. He took the cigarette out momentarily and spoke in the confident voice to which I was accustomed. “Always a pleasure to see you, ma’am.”\\n\\n I watched them through the rearview mirror until Mom opened the trunk. Moments later, Augustus opened a door behind me and engaged in the complicated business of entering the backseat of a car with one leg.\\n\\n “Do you want shotgun?” I asked.\\n\\n “Absolutely not,” he said. “And hello, Hazel Grace.”\\n\\n “Hi,” I said. “Okay?” I asked.\\n\\n “Okay,” he said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fault-in-our-stars/page-12.html","bookId":2735,"book":{"id":2735,"title":"The Fault in Our Stars","description":"Storyline: Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis.
