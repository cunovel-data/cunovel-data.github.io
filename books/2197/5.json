{"id":101283,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I WAS WALKING IN MY SLEEP. IT WAS A GOOD THING I knew every inch of Merlotte\u0027s like I knew my own house, or I\u0027d have bumped into every table and chair. I yawned widely as I took Selah Pumphrey\u0027s order. Ordinarily Selah irritated the hell out of me. She\u0027d been dating Nameless Ex-Lover for several weeks - well, months now. No matter how invisible Ex had become, she\u0027d never be my favorite person.\n \"Not getting enough rest, Sookie?\" she asked, her voice sharp.\n \"Excuse me,\" I apologized. \"I guess not. I was at my brother\u0027s wedding last night. What kind of dressing did you want on that salad?\"\n \"Ranch.\" Selah\u0027s big dark eyes were examining me like she was thinking of etching my portrait. She really wanted to know all about Jason\u0027s wedding, but asking me would be like surrendering ground to the enemy. Silly Selah.\n Come to think of it, what was Selah doing here? She\u0027d never come in without Bill. She lived in Clarice. Not that Clarice was far; you could get there in fifteen or twenty minutes. But why would a real estate saleswoman from Clarice be...oh. She must be showing a house here. Yes, the brain was moving slowly today.\n \"Okeydokey. Coming right up,\" I said, and turned to go.\n \"Listen,\" Selah said. \"Let me be frank.\"\n Oh, boy. In my experience, that meant, \"Let me be openly mean.\"\n I swung around, trying to look anything but massively irritated, which was what I actually was. This was not the day to screw with me. Among my many worries, Amelia hadn\u0027t come home the night before, and when I\u0027d gone upstairs to look for Bob, I\u0027d found that he\u0027d thrown up in the middle of Amelia\u0027s bed...which would have been okay by me, but it had been covered with my great-grandmother\u0027s quilt. It had fallen to me to clean up the mess and get the quilt to soaking in the washing machine. Quinn had left early that morning, and I was simply sad about that. And then there was Jason\u0027s marriage, which had such potential to be a disaster.\n I could think of a few more items to add to the list (down to the dripping tap in my kitchen), but you get that my day was not a happy one.\n \"I\u0027m here working, Selah. I\u0027m not here to have any personal chitchats with you.\"\n She ignored that.\n \"I know you\u0027re going on a trip with Bill,\" she said. \"You\u0027re trying to steal him back from me. How long have you been scheming about this?\"\n I know my mouth was hanging open, because I just hadn\u0027t gotten enough warning that was coming. My telepathy was affected when I was tired - just as my reaction time and thought processes were - and I was heavily shielded when I worked, as a matter of course. So I hadn\u0027t picked up on Selah\u0027s thoughts. A flash of rage passed through me, lifting my palm and raising it to slap the shit out of her. But a warm, hard hand took mine, gripped it, brought it down to my side. Sam was there, and I hadn\u0027t even seen him coming. I was missing everything today.\n \"Miss Pumphrey, you\u0027ll have to get your lunch somewhere else,\" Sam said quietly. Of course, everyone was watching. I could feel all the brains go on alert for fresh gossip as eyes drank in every nuance of the scene. I could feel my face redden.\n \"I have the right to eat here,\" Selah said, her voice loud and arrogant. That was a huge mistake. In an instant, the sympathies of the spectators switched to me. I could feel the wave of it wash over me. I widened my eyes and looked sad like one of those abnormally big-eyed kids in the awful waif paintings. Looking pathetic was no big stretch. Sam put an arm around me as though I were a wounded child and looked at Selah with nothing on his face but a grave disappointment in her behavior.\n \"I have the right to tell you to go,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t have you insulting my staff.\"\n Selah was never likely to be rude to Arlene or Holly or Danielle. She hardly knew they existed, because she wasn\u0027t the kind of woman who really looked at a server. It had always stuck in her craw that Bill had dated me before he\u0027d met her. (\"Dated,\" in Selah\u0027s book, being a euphemism for \"had enthusiastic and frequent sex with.\")\n Selah\u0027s body was jerky with anger as she threw her napkin on the floor. She got to her feet so abruptly that her chair would have fallen if Dawson, a boulder of a werewolf who ran a motorcycle repair business, hadn\u0027t caught it with one huge hand. Selah grabbed up her purse to stalk out of the door, narrowly avoiding a collision with my friend Tara, who was entering.\n Dawson was highly amused by the whole scene. \"All that over a vamp,\" he said. \"Them cold-blooded things must be something, to get fine-looking women so upset.\"\n \"Who\u0027s upset?\" I said, smiling and standing straighter to show Sam I was unfazed. I doubt he was fooled, since Sam knows me pretty well, but he got my emotional drift and went back behind the bar. The buzz of discussion of this juicy scene rose from the lunch crowd. I strode over to the table where Tara was sitting. She had JB du Rone in tow.\n \"Looking good, JB,\" I said brightly, pulling the menus from between the napkin box and the salt and pepper shakers in the middle of the table and handing one to him and one to Tara. My hands were shaking, but I don\u0027t think they noticed.\n JB smiled up at me. \"Thanks, Sookie,\" he said in his pleasant baritone. JB was just beautiful, but really short on the brains. However, that gave him a charming simplicity. Tara and I had watched out for him in school, because once that simplicity was observed and targeted by other, less handsome boys, JB had been in for some rough patches...especially in junior high. Since Tara and I also both had huge flaws in our own popularity profiles, we\u0027d tried to protect JB as much as we were able. In return, JB had squired me to a couple of dances I\u0027d wanted to go to very badly, and his family had given Tara a place to stay a couple of times when I couldn\u0027t.\n Tara had had sex with JB somewhere along this painful road. I hadn\u0027t. It didn\u0027t seem to make any difference to either relationship.\n \"JB has a new job,\" Tara said, smiling in a self-satisfied way. So that was why she\u0027d come in. Our relationship had been uneasy for the past few months, but she knew I\u0027d want to share in her pride at having done a good thing for JB.\n That was great news. And it helped me not think about Selah Pumphrey and her load of anger.\n \"Whereabouts?\" I asked JB, who was looking at the menu as if he\u0027d never seen it before.\n \"At the health club in Clarice,\" he said. He looked up and smiled. \"Two days a week, I sit at the desk wearing this.\" He waved a hand at his clean and tight-fitting golf shirt, striped burgundy and brown, and his pressed khakis. \"I get the members to sign in, I make healthy shakes, and I clean the equipment and hand out towels. Three days a week, I wear workout clothes and I spot for all the ladies.\"\n \"That sounds great,\" I said, awestruck at the perfection of the job for JB\u0027s limited qualifications. JB was lovely: impressive muscles, handsome face, straight white teeth. He was an ad for physical health. Also, he was naturally good-natured and neat.\n Tara looked at me, expecting her due praise. \"Good work,\" I told her. We gave each other a high five.\n \"Now, Sookie, the only thing that would make life perfect is you calling me some night,\" JB said. No one could project a wholesome, simple lust like JB.\n \"Thanks so much, JB, but I\u0027m seeing someone now,\" I said, not troubling to keep my voice down. After Selah\u0027s little exhibition, I felt the need to brag a little.\n \"Oooh, that Quinn?\" Tara asked. I may have mentioned him to her once or twice. I nodded, and we did another high five. \"Is he in town now?\" she asked in a lower voice, and I said, \"Left this morning,\" just as quietly.\n \"I want the Mexican cheeseburger,\" JB said.\n \"Then I\u0027ll get you one,\" I said, and after Tara had ordered, I marched to the kitchen. Not only was I delighted for JB, I was happy that Tara and I seemed to have mended our fences. I had needed a little upswing to my day, and I had gotten it.\n When I reached home with a couple of bags of groceries, Amelia was back and my kitchen sparkled like an exhibit in a Southern Homes show. When she was feeling stressed or bored, Amelia cleaned, which was a fantastic habit to have in a housemate - especially when you\u0027re not used to having one at all. I like a neat house myself, and I get cleaning spurts from time to time, but next to Amelia I was a slob.\n I looked at the clean windows. \"Feeling guilty, huh?\" I said.\n Amelia\u0027s shoulders slumped. She was sitting at the kitchen table with a mug of one of her weird teas, steam rising from the dark liquid.\n \"Yeah,\" she said glumly. \"I saw the quilt was in the washing machine. I worked on the spot, and it\u0027s hanging out back on the line now.\"\n Since I\u0027d noted that when I came in, I just nodded. \"Bob retaliated,\" I said.\n \"Yeah.\"\n I started to ask her who she\u0027d stayed with, then realized it was really none of my business. Besides, though I was very tired, Amelia was a broadcaster of the first order, and within seconds I knew she\u0027d stayed with Calvin\u0027s cousin Derrick and the sex hadn\u0027t been good; also, Derrick\u0027s sheets had been very dirty and that had made her nuts. Plus, when Derrick had woken up this morning, he\u0027d indicated that in his mind, a night together made them a couple. Amelia had had a hard time getting Derrick to give her a ride back to the house. He wanted her to stay with him, in Hotshot.\n \"Weirded out?\" I asked, putting the hamburger meat in the refrigerator drawer. It was my week to cook, and we were going to have hamburger steak, baked potatoes, and green beans.\n Amelia nodded, lifting her mug to take a sip. It was a homemade hangover restorative she\u0027d concocted, and she shuddered as she experimented on herself. \"Yeah, I am. Those Hotshot guys are a little strange,\" she said.\n \"Some of them.\" Amelia had adjusted better to my telepathy than anyone I\u0027d ever encountered. Since she was frank and open anyway - sometimes way too much - I guess she never felt she had secrets to hide.\n \"What are you gonna do?\" I asked. I sat down opposite her.\n \"See, it\u0027s not like I\u0027d been dating Bob for a long time,\" she said, jumping right into the middle of the conversation without bothering with preliminaries. She knew I understood. \"We\u0027d only gotten together that one night. Believe me, it was great. He really got me. That\u0027s why we began, ah, experimenting.\"\n I nodded, tried to look understanding. To me, experimenting was, well, licking a place you\u0027d never licked before, or trying a position that gave you a cramp in your thigh. Like that. It did not involve turning your partner into an animal. I\u0027d never worked up enough nerve to ask Amelia what their goal had been, and it was one thing her brain wasn\u0027t throwing out.\n \"I guess you like cats,\" I said, following my train of thought to its logical conclusion. \"I mean, Bob is a cat, but a small one, and then you picked Derrick out of all the guys who would have been thrilled to spend the night with you.\"\n \"Oh?\" Amelia said, perking up. She tried to sound casual. \"More than one?\"\n Amelia did have the tendency to think way too well of herself as a witch, but not enough of herself as a woman.\n \"One or two,\" I said, trying not to laugh. Bob came in and wreathed himself around my legs, purring loudly. It could hardly have been more pointed, since he walked around Amelia as if she were a pile of dog poop.\n Amelia sighed heavily. \"Listen, Bob, you\u0027ve gotta forgive me,\" she said to the cat. \"I\u0027m sorry. I just got carried away. A wedding, a few beers, dancing in the street, an exotic partner...I\u0027m sorry. Really, really sorry. How about I promise to be celibate until I can figure out a way to turn you back into yourself?\"\n This was a huge sacrifice on Amelia\u0027s part, as anyone who\u0027d read her thoughts for a couple of days (and more) would know. Amelia was a very healthy girl and she was a very direct woman. She was also fairly diverse in her tastes. \"Well,\" she said, on second thought, \"what if I just promise not to do any guys?\"\n Bob\u0027s hind end sat while his front end stood, and his tail wrapped around his front paws. He looked adorable as he stared up at Amelia, his large yellow eyes unblinking. He appeared to be thinking it over. Finally, he said, \"Rohr.\"\n Amelia smiled.\n \"You taking that as a yes?\" I said. \"If so, remember...I just do guys, so don\u0027t go looking my way.\"\n \"Oh, I probably wouldn\u0027t try to hook up with you anyway,\" Amelia said.\n Did I mention Amelia is a little tactless? \"Why not?\" I asked, insulted.\n \"I didn\u0027t pick Bob at random,\" Amelia said, looking as embarrassed as it is possible for Amelia to look. \"I like \u0027em skinny and dark.\"\n \"I\u0027ll just have to live with that,\" I said, trying to look deeply disappointed. Amelia threw a tea ball at me, and I caught it in midair.\n \"Good reflexes,\" she said, startled.\n I shrugged. Though it had been ages since I\u0027d had vampire blood, a trace seemed to linger on in my system. I\u0027d always been healthy, but now I seldom even got a headache. And I moved a little quicker than most people. I wasn\u0027t the only person to enjoy the side effects of vamp blood ingestion. Now that the effects have become common knowledge, vampires have become prey themselves. Harvesting that blood to sell on the black market is a lucrative and highly perilous profession. I\u0027d heard on the radio that morning that a drainer had disappeared from his Texarkana apartment after he\u0027d gotten out on parole. If you make an enemy of a vamp, he can wait it out a lot longer than you can.\n \"Maybe it\u0027s the fairy blood,\" Amelia said, staring at me thoughtfully.\n I shrugged again, this time with a definite drop-this-subject air. I\u0027d learned I had a trace of fairy in my lineage only recently, and I wasn\u0027t happy about it. I didn\u0027t even know which side of my family had bequeathed me this legacy, much less which individual. All I knew was that at some time in the past, someone in my family had gotten up close and personal with a fairy. I\u0027d spent a couple of hours poring over the yellowing family trees and the family history my grandmother had worked so hard to compile, and I hadn\u0027t found a clue.\n As if she\u0027d been summoned by the thought, Claudine knocked at the back door. She hadn\u0027t flown on gossamer wings; she\u0027d arrived in her car. Claudine is a full-blooded fairy, and she has other ways of getting places, but she uses those ways only in emergencies. Claudine is very tall, with a thick fall of dark hair and big, slanted dark eyes. She has to cover her ears with her hair, since unlike her twin, Claude, she hasn\u0027t had the pointy parts surgically altered.\n Claudine hugged me enthusiastically but gave Amelia a distant wave. They are not nuts about each other. Amelia has acquired magic, but Claudine is magic to the bone. Neither quite trusts the other.\n Claudine is normally the sunniest creature I ever met. She is very kind, and sweet, and helpful, like a supernatural Girl Scout, because it\u0027s her nature and because she\u0027s trying to work her way up the magical ladder to become an angel. Tonight, Claudine\u0027s face was unusually serious. My heart sank. I wanted to go to bed, and I wanted to miss Quinn in private, and I wanted to get over the jangling my nerves had taken at Merlotte\u0027s. I didn\u0027t want bad news.\n Claudine settled at the kitchen table across from me and held my hands. She spared a look for Amelia. \"Take a hike, witch,\" she said, and I was shocked.\n \"Pointy-eared bitch,\" muttered Amelia, getting up with her mug of tea.\n \"Mate killer,\" responded Claudine.\n \"He\u0027s not dead!\" shrieked Amelia. \"He\u0027s just - different!\"\n Claudine snorted, and actually that was an adequate response.\n I was too tired to scold Claudine for her unprecedented rudeness, and she was holding my hands too tight for me to be pleased about her comforting presence. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked. Amelia stomped out of the room, and I heard her shoes on the stairs up to the second floor.\n \"No vampires here?\" Claudine said, her voice anxious. You know how a chocoholic feels about chunky fudge ice cream, double dipped in dark chocolate? That\u0027s how vamps feel about fairies.\n \"Yeah, the house is empty except for me, you, Amelia, and Bob,\" I said. I was not going to deny Bob his personhood, though sometimes it was pretty hard to recall, especially when his litter box needed cleaning.\n \"You\u0027re going to this summit?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Why?\"\n That was a good question. \"The queen is paying me,\" I said.\n \"Do you need the money so badly?\"\n I started to dismiss her concern, but then I gave it some serious thought. Claudine had done a lot for me, and the least I could do for her was think about what she said.\n \"I can live without it,\" I said. After all, I still had some of the money Eric had paid me for hiding him from a group of witches. But a chunk of it had gone, as money seems to; the insurance hadn\u0027t covered everything that had been damaged or destroyed by the fire that had consumed my kitchen the winter before, and I\u0027d upgraded my appliances, and I\u0027d made a donation to the volunteer fire department. They\u0027d come so quickly and tried so hard to save the kitchen and my car.\n Then Jason had needed help to pay the doctor\u0027s bill for Crystal\u0027s miscarriage.\n I found I missed that layer of padding between being solvent and being broke. I wanted to reinforce it, replenish it. My little boat sailed on precarious financial waters, and I wanted to have a towboat around to keep it afloat.\n \"I can live without it,\" I said, more firmly, \"but I don\u0027t want to.\"\n Claudine sighed. Her face was full of woe. \"I can\u0027t go with you,\" she said. \"You know how vampires are around us. I can\u0027t even put in an appearance.\"\n \"I understand,\" I said, a bit surprised. I\u0027d never dreamed of Claudine\u0027s going.\n \"And I think there\u0027s going to be trouble,\" she said.\n \"What kind?\" The last time I\u0027d gone to a vampire social gathering, there had been big trouble, major trouble, the bloodiest kind of trouble.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Claudine said. \"But I feel it coming, and I think you should stay home. Claude does, too.\"\n Claude didn\u0027t give a rat\u0027s ass what happened to me, but Claudine was generous enough to include her brother in her kindness. As far as I could tell, Claude\u0027s benefit to the world was strictly as a decoration. He was utterly selfish, had no social skills, and was absolutely beautiful.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Claudine, and I\u0027ll miss you while I\u0027m in Rhodes,\" I said. \"But I\u0027ve obligated myself to go.\"\n \"Going in the train of a vampire,\" Claudine said dismally. \"It\u0027ll mark you as one of their world, for good. You\u0027ll never be an innocent bystander again. Too many creatures will know who you are and where you can be found.\"\n It wasn\u0027t so much what Claudine said as the way she said it that made cold prickles run up my spine and crawl along my scalp. She was right. I had no defense, though I rather thought that I was already into the vamp world too deeply to opt out.\n Sitting there in my kitchen with the late afternoon sun slanting through the window, I had one of those illuminations that changes you forever. Amelia was silent upstairs. Bob had come back into the room to sit by his food bowl and stare at Claudine. Claudine herself was gleaming in a beam of sunlight that hit her square in the face. Most people would be showing every unattractive skin flaw. Claudine still looked perfect.\n I wasn\u0027t sure I would ever understand Claudine and her thinking about the world, and I still knew frighteningly little about her life; but I felt quite sure that she had devoted herself to my well-being, for whatever reason, and that she was really afraid for me. And yet I knew I was going to Rhodes with the queen, and Eric, and the abjured one, and the rest of the Louisiana contingent.\n Was I just curious about what the agenda might be at a vampire summit? Did I want the attention of more undead members of society? Did I want to be known as a fangbanger, one of those humans who simply adored the walking dead? Did some corner of me long for a chance to be near Bill without seeking him out, still trying to make some emotional sense of his betrayal? Or was this about Eric? Unbeknownst to myself, was I in love with the flamboyant Viking who was so handsome, so good at making love, and so political, all at the same time?\n This sounded like a promising set of problems for a soap opera season.\n \"Tune in tomorrow,\" I muttered. When Claudine looked at me askance, I said, \"Claudine, I feel embarrassed to tell you I\u0027m doing something that really doesn\u0027t make much sense in a lot of ways, but I want the money and I\u0027m going to do it. I\u0027ll be back here to see you again. Don\u0027t worry, please.\"\n Amelia clomped back into the room, began making herself some more tea. She was going to float away.\n Claudine ignored her. \"I\u0027m going to worry,\" she said simply. \"There is trouble coming, my dear friend, and it will fall right on your head.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t know how or when?\"\n She shook her head. \"No, I just know it\u0027s coming.\"\n \"Look into my eyes,\" muttered Amelia. \"I see a tall, dark man...\"\n \"Shut up,\" I told her.\n She turned her back to us, made a big fuss out of pinching the dead leaves off some of her plants.\n Claudine left soon after. For the remainder of her visit, she didn\u0027t recover her normal happy demeanor. She never said another word about my departure. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-together-dead-sookie-stackhouse-7/page-5.html","bookId":2197,"book":{"id":2197,"title":"All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7) \n Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has her hands full dealing with every sort of undead and paranormal creature imaginable.
