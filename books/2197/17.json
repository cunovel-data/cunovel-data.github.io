{"id":101295,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"MY EYES SNAPPED OPEN LIKE SHADES THAT WERE wound too tight. Wake up, wake up, wake up! Sookie, something\u0027s wrong. Barry, where are you? Standing at the elevators on the human floor. I\u0027m coming. I pulled on last night\u0027s outfit, but without the heels. Instead, I slid my feet into my rubber-soled slippers. I grabbed the slim wallet that held my room key, driver\u0027s license, and credit card, and stuffed it in one pocket, jammed my cell phone into the other, and hurried out of the room. The door slammed behind me with an ominous thud. The hotel felt empty and silent, but my clock had read 9:50. I had to run down a long corridor and turn right to get to the elevators. I didn\u0027t meet a soul. A moment\u0027s thought told me that was not so strange. Most humans on the floor would still be asleep, because they kept vampire hours. But there weren\u0027t even any hotel employees cleaning the halls. All the little tracks of disquiet that had crawled through my brain, like slug tracks on your back doorstep, had coalesced into a huge throbbing mass of uneasiness. I felt like I was on the Titanic, and I\u0027d just heard the hull scrape against the iceberg. I finally spotted someone, lying on the floor. I\u0027d been woken so suddenly and sharply that everything I did had a dreamlike quality to it, so finding a body in the hall was not such a jolt. I let out a cry, and Barry came bounding around the corner. He crouched down with me. I rolled over the body. It was Jake Purifoy, and he couldn\u0027t be roused. Why isn\u0027t he in his room? What was he doing out so late? Even Barry\u0027s mental voice sounded panicked. Look, Barry, he\u0027s lying sort of pointing toward my room. Do you think he was coming to see me? Yes, and he didn\u0027t make it. What could have been so important that Jake wasn\u0027t prepared for his day\u0027s sleep? I stood up, thinking furiously. I\u0027d never, ever heard of a vampire who didn\u0027t know instinctively that the dawn was coming. I thought of the conversations I\u0027d had with Jake, and the two men I\u0027d seen leaving his room. \"You bastard,\" I hissed through my teeth, and I kicked him as hard as I could. \"Jesus, Sookie!\" Barry grabbed my arm, horrified. But then he got the picture from my brain. \"We need to find Mr. Cataliades and Diantha,\" I said. \"They can get up; they\u0027re not vamps.\" \"I\u0027ll get Cecile. She\u0027s human, my roommate,\" Barry said, and we both went off in different directions, leaving Jake to lie where he was. It was all we could do. We were back together in five minutes. It had been surprisingly easy to raise Mr. Cataliades, and Diantha had been sharing his room. Cecile proved to be a young woman with a no-nonsense haircut and a competent way about her, and I wasn\u0027t surprised when Barry introduced her as the king\u0027s new executive assistant. I\u0027d been a fool to discount, even for a minute, the warning that Clovache had passed along. I was so angry at myself I could hardly stand to be inside my own skin. But I had to shove that aside and we had to act now. \"Listen to what I think,\" I said. I\u0027d been putting things together in my head. \"Some of the waiters have been avoiding Barry and me over the past couple of days, as soon as they found out what we were.\" Barry nodded. He\u0027d noticed, too. He looked oddly guilty, but that had to wait. \"They know what we are. They didn\u0027t want us to know what they\u0027re about to do, I\u0027m assuming. So I\u0027m also assuming it must be something really, really bad. And Jake Purifoy was in on it.\" Mr. Cataliades had been looking faintly bored, but now he began to look seriously alarmed. Diantha\u0027s big eyes went from face to face. \"What shall we do?\" Cecile asked, which earned her high marks in my book. \"It\u0027s the extra coffins,\" I said. \"And the blue suitcase in the queen\u0027s suite. Barry, you were asked to bring up a suitcase, too, right? And it didn\u0027t belong to anyone?\" Barry said, \"Right. It\u0027s still sitting in the foyer of the king\u0027s suite, since everyone passes through there. We thought someone would claim it. I was going to take it back to the luggage department today.\" I said, \"The one I went down for is sitting in the living room of the queen\u0027s suite. I think the guy who was in on it was Joe, the manager down in the luggage and delivery area. He\u0027s the one who called me down to get the suitcase. No one else seemed to know anything about it.\" \"The suitcases will blow up?\" Diantha said in her shrill voice. \"The unclaimed coffins in the basement, too? If the basement goes, the building will collapse!\" I\u0027d never heard Diantha sound so human. \"We have to wake them up,\" I said. \"We have to get them out.\" \"The building\u0027s going to blow,\" said Barry, trying to process the idea. \"The vamps won\u0027t wake up.\" Cecile the practical. \"They can\u0027t.\" \"Quinn!\" I said. I was thinking of so many things at once that I was standing rooted in place. Fishing my phone from my pocket, I punched his number on speed dial and heard his mumble at the other end. \"Get out,\" I said. \"Quinn, get your sister and get out. There\u0027s going to be an explosion.\" I only waited to hear him sound more alert before I shut the phone. \"We have to save ourselves, too,\" Barry was saying. Brilliantly, Cecile ran down the hall to a red fixture and flipped the fire alarm. The clamor almost split our eardrums, but the effect was wonderful on the sleeping humans on this floor. Within seconds, they began to come out of the rooms. \"Take the stairs,\" Cecile directed them in a bellow, and obediently, they did. I was glad to see Carla\u0027s dark head among them. But I didn\u0027t see Quinn, and he was always easy to spot. \"The queen is high up,\" said Mr. Cataliades. \"Can those glass panels be busted from the inside?\" I asked. \"They did it on Fear Factor,\" Barry said. \"We could try sliding the coffins down.\" \"They\u0027d break on impact,\" Cecile said. \"But the vamps would survive the explosion,\" I pointed out. \"To be burned up by the sun,\" Mr. Cataliades said. \"Diantha and I will go up and try to get out the queen\u0027s party, wrapped up in blankets. We\u0027ll take them...\" He looked at me desperately. \"Ambulances! Call 911 now! They can figure out where to take them!\" Diantha called 911 and was incoherent and desperate enough to get ambulances started to an explosion that had not happened yet. \"The building\u0027s on fire,\" she said, which was like a future truth. \"Go,\" I told Mr. Cataliades, actually shoving the demon, and off he sped to the queen\u0027s suite. \"Go try to get your party out,\" I said to Barry, and he and Cecile ran for the elevator, though at any minute it might be unworkable. I\u0027d done everything about getting humans out that I could. Cataliades and Diantha could take care of the queen and Andre. Eric and Pam! I knew where Eric\u0027s room was, thank God. I took the stairs. As I ran up, I met a party coming down: the two Britlingens, both with large packs on their backs, carrying a wrapped bundle. Clovache had the feet, Batanya the head. I had no doubt that the bundle was the King of Kentucky, and that they were doing their duty. They both nodded as I hugged the wall to let them by. If they weren\u0027t as calm as if they were out for a stroll, they were close to it. \"You set off the fire alarm?\" Batanya said. \"Whatever the Fellowship is doing, it\u0027s today?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Thanks. We\u0027re getting out now, and you should, too,\" Clovache said. \"We\u0027ll go back to our place after we deposit him,\" Batanya said. \"Good-bye.\" \"Good luck,\" I told them stupidly, and then I was running upstairs as if I\u0027d trained for this. As a result, I was huffing like a bellows when I flung open the door to the ninth floor. I saw a lone maid pushing a cart down a long corridor. I ran up to her, frightening her even more than the fire alarm already had. \"Give me your master key,\" I said. \"No!\" She was middle-aged and Hispanic, and she wasn\u0027t about to give in to such a crazy demand. \"I\u0027ll get fired.\" \"Then open this door\" - I pointed to Eric\u0027s - \"and get out of here.\" I\u0027m sure I looked like a desperate woman, and I was. \"This building is going to blow up any minute.\" She flung the key at me and made tracks down the hallway to the elevators. Dammit. And then the explosions began. There was a deep, resounding quiver and a boom from way below my feet, as if some gargantuan sea creature were making its way to the surface. I staggered over to Eric\u0027s room, thrusting the plastic key into the slot and shoving open the door in a moment of utter silence. The room was in complete darkness. \"Eric, Pam!\" I yelled. I fumbled for a light switch in the pitch-black room, felt the building sway. At least one of the upper charges had gone off. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! But the light came on, and I saw that Eric and Pam had gotten in the beds, not the coffins. \"Wake up!\" I said, shaking Pam since she was closest. She didn\u0027t stir at all. It was exactly like shaking a doll stuffed with sawdust. \"Eric!\" I screamed right in his ear. This got a bit of a reaction; he was much older than Pam. His eyes opened a slit and tried to focus. \"What?\" he said. \"You have to get up! You have to! You have to go out!\" \"Daytime,\" he whispered. He began to flop over on his side. I slapped him harder than I\u0027ve ever hit anyone in my life. I screamed, \"Get up!\" until my voice would hardly work. Finally Eric stirred and managed to sit up. He was wearing black silk pajama bottoms, thank God, and I spied the ceremonial black cloak tossed over his coffin. He hadn\u0027t returned it to Quinn, which was huge luck. I arranged it over him and fastened it at the neck. I pulled the hood over his face. \"Cover your head!\" I yelled, and I heard a burst of noise above my head: shattering glass, followed by shrieks. Eric would drop back to sleep if I didn\u0027t keep him awake. At least he was trying. I remembered that Bill had managed to stagger, under dire circumstances, at least for a few minutes. But Pam, though roughly the same age as Bill, simply could not be roused. I even pulled her long pale hair. \"You have to help me get Pam out,\" I said finally, despairing. \"Eric, you just have to.\" There was another roar and a lurch in the floor. I screamed, and Eric\u0027s eyes went wide. He staggered to his feet. As if we\u0027d shared thoughts like Barry and I could, we both shoved his coffin off its trestle and onto the carpet. Then we slid it over to the opaque slanting glass panel forming the side of the building. Everything around us trembled and shook. Eric\u0027s eyes were a little wider now, and he was concentrating so heavily on keeping himself moving that his strength was pulling on mine. \"Pam,\" I said, trying to push him into more action. I opened the coffin, after some desperate fumbling. Eric went over to his sleeping child, walking like his feet were sticking to the floor with each step. He took Pam\u0027s shoulders and I took her feet, and we picked her up, blanket and all. The floor shook again, more violently this time, and we lurched over to the coffin and tossed Pam into it. I shut the lid and latched it, though a corner of Pam\u0027s nightgown was sticking out. I thought about Bill, and Rasul flashed across my mind, but there was nothing I could do, and there wasn\u0027t any time left. \"We have to break the glass!\" I shrieked at Eric. He nodded very slowly. We knelt to brace ourselves against the end of the coffin and we pushed as hard as we could till it slammed into the glass, which cracked into about a thousand pieces. They hung together, amazingly - the miracle of safety glass. I could have screamed from frustration. We needed a hole, not a curtain of glass. Crouching lower, digging our toes into the carpet, trying to ignore the rumbling noises in the building below us, Eric and I shoved with all our strength. Finally! We punched the coffin all the way through. The window let go of its frame and cascaded down the side of the building. And Eric saw sunlight for the first time in a thousand years. He screamed, a terrible, gut-wrenching noise. But in the next instant, he pulled the cloak tight around him. He grabbed me and hopped astride the coffin, and we pushed off with our feet. For just a fraction of a minute, we hung in the balance, and then we tilted forward. In the most awful moment of my life, we went out the window and began tobogganing down the building on the coffin. We would crash unless - Suddenly we were off the coffin and kind of staggering through the air, Eric holding me to him with dogged persistence. I exhaled with profound relief. Of course, Eric could fly. In his light-stunned stupor, he couldn\u0027t fly very well. This was not the smooth progress I\u0027d experienced before; we had more of a zigzag, bobbing descent. But it was better than a free fall. Eric could delay our descent enough to keep me from being dashed to my death on the street outside the hotel. However, the coffin with Pam inside had a bad landing, and Pam came catapulting out of the remains of the wood and into the sunlight where she lay motionless. Without making a sound, she began to burn. Eric landed on top of her and used the blanket to cover both of them. One of Pam\u0027s feet was exposed, and the flesh was smoking. I covered it up. I also heard the sound of sirens. I flagged down the first ambulance I saw, and the medics leaped out. I pointed to the blanketed heap. \"Two vampires - get them out of the sun!\" I said. The pair of EMTs, both young women, exchanged an incredulous glance. \"What do we do with them?\" asked the dark one. \"You take them to a nice basement somewhere, one without any windows, and you tell the owners to keep that basement open, because there are gonna be more.\" High up, a smaller explosion blew out one of the suites. A suitcase bomb, I thought, wondering how many Joe had talked us into carrying up into the rooms. A fine shower of glass sparkled in the sun as we looked up, but darker things were following the glass out of the window, and the EMTs began to move like the trained team they were. They didn\u0027t panic, but they definitely moved with haste, and they were already debating which building close at hand had a large basement. \"We\u0027ll tell everyone,\" said the dark woman. Pam was now in the ambulance and Eric halfway there. His face was bright red and steam was rising from his lips. Oh, my God. \"What you going to do?\" \"I have to go back in there,\" I said. \"Fool,\" she said, and then threw herself in the ambulance, which took off. There was more glass raining down, and part of the bottom floor appeared to be collapsing. That would be due to some of the larger explosive-packed coffin bombs in the shipping and receiving area. Another explosion came from about the sixth floor, but on the other side of the pyramid. My senses were so dulled by the sound and the sight that I wasn\u0027t surprised when I saw a blue suitcase flying through the air. Mr. Cataliades had succeeded in breaking the queen\u0027s window. Suddenly I realized the suitcase was intact, had not exploded, and was hurtling straight at me. I began to run, flashing back to my softball days when I had sprinted from third to home and had to slide in. I aimed for the park across the street, where traffic had come to a stop because of the emergency vehicles: cop cars, ambulances, fire engines. There was a cop just ahead of me who was facing away, pointing something out to another cop. \"Down!\" I yelled. \"Bomb!\" and she swung around to face me and I tackled her, taking her down to the ground with me. Something hit me in the middle of the back, whoosh, and the air was shoved out of my lungs. We lay there for a long minute, until I pushed myself off of her and climbed unsteadily to my feet. It was wonderful to inhale, though the air was acrid with flames and dust. She might have said something to me, but I couldn\u0027t hear her. I turned around to face the Pyramid of Gizeh. Parts of the structure were crumbling, folding in and down, all the glass and concrete and steel and wood separating from the whole into discrete parts, while most of the walls that had created the spaces - of rooms and bathrooms and halls - collapsed. That collapse trapped many of the bodies that had occupied these arbitrarily divided areas. They were all one now: the structure, its parts, its inhabitants. Here and there were still bits that had held together. The human floor, the mezzanine, and the lobby level were partially intact, though the area around the registration desk was destroyed. I saw a shape I recognized, a coffin. The lid had popped clean off with the impact of its fall. As the sun hit the creature inside, it let out a wail, and I rushed over. There was a hunk of drywall by it, and I hauled that over the coffin. There was silence as soon as the sun was blocked from touching the vampire inside. \"Help!\" I yelled. \"Help!\" A few policemen moved toward me. \"There are people and vamps still alive,\" I said. \"The vamps have to be covered.\" \"People first,\" said one beefy veteran. \"Sure,\" I agreed automatically, though even as I said it, I thought, Vampires didn\u0027t set these bombs. \"But if you can cover the vamps, they can last until ambulances can take them to a safe place.\" There was a chunk of hotel still standing, a bit of the south part. Looking up, I saw Mr. Cataliades standing at an empty frame where the glass had fallen away. Somehow, he had worked his way down to the human floor. He was holding a bundle wrapped in a bedspread, clutching it to his chest. \"Look!\" I called, to get a fireman\u0027s attention. \"Look!\" They leaped into action at seeing a live person to rescue. They were far more enthusiastic about that than about rescuing vamps who were possibly smoldering to death in the sunlight and could easily be saved by being covered. I tried to blame them, but I couldn\u0027t. For the first time I noticed that there was a crowd of regular people who had stopped their cars and gotten out to help - or gawk. There were also people who were screaming, \"Let them burn!\" I watched the firemen go up in a bucket to fetch the demon and his burden, and then I turned back to working my way through the rubble. After a time, I was flagging. The screams of the human survivors, the smoke, the sunlight muted by the huge cloud of dust, the noise of the groaning structure settling, the hectic noise of the rescue workers and the machinery that was arriving and being employed...I was overwhelmed. By that time, since I\u0027d stolen one of the yellow jackets and one of the hard hats all the rescuers were wearing, I\u0027d gotten close enough to find two vampires, one of whom I knew, in the ruins of the check-in area, heavily overlaid by debris from the floors above. A big piece of wood survived to identify the reception desk. One of the vampires was very burned, and I had no idea if he\u0027d survive it or not. The other vamp had hidden beneath the largest piece of wood, and only his feet and hands had been singed and blackened. Once I yelled for help, the vamps were covered with blankets. \"We got a building two blocks away; we\u0027re using it for the vampire repository,\" said the dark-skinned ambulance driver who took the more seriously injured one, and I realized it was the same woman who\u0027d taken Eric and Pam. In addition to the vampires, I uncovered a barely alive Todd Donati. I spent a few moments with him until a stretcher got there. And I found, near to him, a dead maid. She\u0027d been crushed. I had a smell in my nose that just wouldn\u0027t go away, and I hated it. It was coating my lungs inside, I thought, and I\u0027d spend the rest of my life breathing it in and breathing it out. The odor was composed of burning building materials, scorched bodies, and disintegrating vampires. It was the smell of hatred. I saw some things so awful I couldn\u0027t even think about them then. Suddenly, I didn\u0027t feel I could search anymore. I had to sit down. I was drawn to a pile created by the chance arrangement of a large pipe and some drywall. I perched on it and wept. Then the whole pile shifted sideways, and I landed on the ground, still weeping. I looked into the opening revealed by the shifted debris. Bill was crouched inside, half his face burned away. He was wearing the clothes I\u0027d last seen him in the night before. I arched myself over him to keep the sun off, and he said, \"Thanks,\" through cracked and bloody lips. He kept slipping in and out of his comatose daytime sleep. \"Jesus God,\" I said. \"Come help!\" I called, and saw two men start toward me with a blanket. \"I knew you\u0027d find me,\" Bill said, or did I imagine that? I stayed hunched in the awkward position. There just wasn\u0027t anything near enough to grab that would cover as much of him as I did. The smell was making me gag, but I stayed. He\u0027d lasted this long only because he\u0027d been covered by accident. Though one fireman threw up, they covered him and took him away. Then I saw another yellow-jacketed figure tear off across the debris field toward the ambulances as fast as anyone could move without breaking a leg. I got the impression of a live brain, and I recognized it at once. I scrambled over piles of rubble, following the signature of the brain of the man I wanted most to find. Quinn and Frannie lay half-buried under a pile of loose rubble. Frannie was unconscious, and she\u0027d been bleeding from the head, but it had dried. Quinn was dazed but coming to full awareness. I could see that fresh water had cut a path in the dust on his face, and I realized the man who\u0027d just dashed away had given Quinn some water to drink and was returning with stretchers for the two. He tried to smile at me. I fell to my knees beside him. \"We might have to change our plans, babe,\" he said. \"I may have to take care of Frannie for a week or two. Our mom\u0027s not exactly Florence Nightingale.\" I tried not to cry, but it was like, once turned to \"on,\" I couldn\u0027t tell my tear ducts to switch off. I wasn\u0027t sobbing anymore, but I was trickling steadily. Stupid. \"You do what you have to do,\" I said. \"You call me when you can. Okay?\" I hated people who said \"Okay?\" all the time, like they were getting permission, but I couldn\u0027t help that, either. \"You\u0027re alive; that\u0027s all that matters.\" \"Thanks to you,\" he said. \"If you hadn\u0027t called, we\u0027d be dead. Even the fire alarm might not have gotten us out of the room in time.\" I heard a groan from a few feet away, a breath on the air. Quinn heard it, too. I crawled away from him, pushing aside a large chunk of toilet and sink. There, covered with dust and debris, under several large bits of drywall, lay Andre, completely out of it. A quick glance told me he had several serious injuries. But none of them was bleeding. He would heal them all. Dammit. \"It\u0027s Andre,\" I told Quinn. \"Hurt, but alive.\" If my voice was grim, I felt grim. There was a nice, long wood splinter right by his leg, and I was so tempted. Andre was a threat to my freedom of will, to everything I enjoyed about my life. But I\u0027d seen so much death that day already. I crouched there beside him, hating him, but after all...I knew him. That should have made it easier, but it didn\u0027t. I duckwalked out of the little alcove where he lay, scuttled back to Quinn. \"Those guys are coming back to get us,\" he told me, sounding stronger every minute. \"You can leave now.\" \"You want me to leave?\" His eyes were telling me something. I wasn\u0027t reading it. \"Okay,\" I said hesitantly. \"I\u0027ll go.\" \"I\u0027ve got help coming,\" he said gently. \"You could be finding someone else.\" \"All right,\" I said, not knowing how to take this, and pushed to my feet. I\u0027d gone maybe two yards when I heard him begin to move. But after a moment of stillness, I kept walking. I returned to a big van that had been brought in and parked close to the rescue command center. This yellow jacket had been a magic pass, but it might run out any minute. Someone would notice I was wearing bedroom slippers, and they were ripping up, since they\u0027d hardly been intended for ruin-scrambling. A woman handed me a bottle of water from the van, and I opened it with unsteady hands. I drank and drank, and poured the rest of the water over my face and hands. Despite the chill in the air, it felt wonderful. By then, two (or four, or six) hours must have passed since the first explosion. There were now scores of rescuers there who had equipment, machinery, blankets. I was casting around for someone who looked authoritative, intending to find out where the other human survivors had been taken, when a voice spoke in my head. Sookie? Barry! What kind of shape are you in? Pretty rocky, but not much hurt. You? Same. Cecile died. I\u0027m so sorry. I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. I\u0027ve thought of something we can do. What? I probably didn\u0027t sound very interested. We can find living people. We\u0027ll be better, together. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing, I told him. But you\u0027re right, together we\u0027ll be stronger. At the same time, I was so tired that something inside of me cringed at the thought of making further effort. Of course we can, I said. If this pile of debris had been as horrifyingly huge as the Twin Towers, we couldn\u0027t have done it. But this site was smaller and more contained, and if we could get anyone to believe us, we had a chance. I found Barry close to the command center, and I took his grimy hand. He was younger than me, but now he didn\u0027t look it, and I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d ever act it again. When I scanned the line of bodies on the grass of the little park, I saw Cecile, and I saw what might have been the maid I\u0027d accosted in the hallway. There were a few flaking, vaguely manlike shapes that were disintegrating vampires. I could have known any of them, but it was impossible to tell. Any humiliation would be a small thing to pay if we could save someone. So Barry and I prepared to be humiliated and mocked. At first, it was hard to get anyone to listen. The professionals kept referring us to the casualty center or to one of the ambulances parked nearby ready to take survivors to one of Rhodes\u0027s hospitals. Finally, I was face-to-face with a thin, gray-haired man who listened to me without any expression on his face at all. \"I never thought I\u0027d be rescuing vampires, either,\" he said, as though that explained his decision, and maybe it did. \"So, take these two men with you, and show \u0027em what you can do. You have fifteen minutes of these men\u0027s valuable time. If you waste it, you might be killing someone.\" Barry had had the idea, but now he seemed to want me to speak for us. His face was blackened with smears of soot. We had a silent conference about the best way to go about our task, and at the end of it, I turned to the firemen and said, \"Put us up in one of those bucket things.\" For a wonder, they did, without further argument. We were lifted out over the debris, and yes, we knew it was dangerous, and yes, we were prepared to take the consequences. Still holding hands, Barry and I shut our eyes and searched, flinging our minds open and outward. \"Move us left,\" I said, and the fireman in the bucket with us gestured to the man in the cab of the machine. \"Watch me,\" I said, and he looked back. \"Stop,\" I said, and the bucket stopped. We searched again. \"Directly below,\" I said. \"Right below here. It\u0027s a woman named something Santiago.\" After a few minutes, a roar went up. They\u0027d found her alive. We were popular after that, and there were no more questions about how we did it, as long as we kept it up. Rescue people are all about rescuing. They were bringing dogs, and they were inserting microphones, but Barry and I were quicker and more articulate than the dogs, and more precise than the microphones. We found four more live people, and we found a man who died before they could get to him, a waiter named Art who loved his wife and suffered terribly right up until the end. Art was especially heartbreaking, because they were trying like hell to dig the guy out, and I had to tell them it was no good. Of course, they didn\u0027t take my word for it; they kept excavating, but he had passed. By that time, the searchers were really excited about our ability and wanted us to work through the night, but Barry was failing and I wasn\u0027t much better. Worse, dark was closing in. \"The vampires\u0027ll be rising,\" I reminded the fire chief. He nodded and looked at me for further explanation. \"They\u0027ll be hurt bad,\" I said. He still didn\u0027t get it. \"They\u0027ll need blood instantly, and they won\u0027t have any control. I wouldn\u0027t send any rescue workers out on the debris alone,\" I said, and his face went blank with thought. \"You don\u0027t think they\u0027re all dead? Can\u0027t you find them?\" \"Well, actually, no. We can\u0027t find vamps. Humans, yes. But not undead. Their brains don\u0027t give off any, ah, waves. We\u0027ve got to go now. Where are the survivors?\" \"They\u0027re all in the Thorne Building, right down there,\" he said, pointing. \"In the basement.\" We turned to walk away. By this time, Barry had slung his arm around my shoulders, and not because he was feeling affectionate. He needed the support. \"Let me get your names and addresses, so the mayor can thank you,\" the gray-haired man said, holding a pen and clipboard at the ready. No! Barry said, and my mouth snapped shut. I shook my head. \"We\u0027re going to pass on that,\" I said. I\u0027d had a quick look in his head, and he was greedy for more of our help. Suddenly I understood why Barry had stopped me so abruptly, though my fellow telepath was so tired he couldn\u0027t tell me himself. My refusal didn\u0027t go over big. \"You\u0027ll work for vamps, but you don\u0027t want to stand and be counted as someone who helped on this terrible day?\" \"Yes,\" I answered. \"That\u0027s just about right.\" He wasn\u0027t happy with me, and I thought for a minute he was going to force the issue: grab my wallet out of my pants, send me to jail, or something. But he reluctantly nodded his head and jerked it in the direction of the Thorne Building. Someone will try to find out, Barry said. Someone will want to use us. I sighed, and I hardly had the energy to take in more air. I nodded. Yeah, someone will. If we go to the shelter, someone will be watching for us there, and they\u0027ll ask for our names from someone who recognizes us, and after that, it\u0027s only a matter of time. I couldn\u0027t think of a way to dodge going in there. We had to have help, we had to find our parties and discover how and when we could leave the city, and we had to find out who had lived and who hadn\u0027t. I patted my back pocket, and to my amazement, my cell phone was still in it and still had bars. I called Mr. Cataliades. If anyone besides me had come out of the Pyramid of Gizeh with a cell phone, the lawyer would be the one. \"Yes,\" he said cautiously. \"Miss St - \" \"Shhh,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t say my name out loud.\" It was sheer paranoia talking. \"Very well.\" \"We helped them out down here, and now they really want to get to know us better,\" I said, feeling very clever for talking so guardedly. I was very tired. \"Barry and I are outside the building where you are. We need to stay somewhere else. Too many people making lists in there, right?\" \"That is a popular activity,\" he said. \"You and Diantha okay?\" \"She has not been found. We were separated.\" I didn\u0027t speak for a few seconds. \"I\u0027m so sorry. Who were you holding when I saw them rescue you?\" \"The queen. She is here, though badly injured. We can\u0027t find Andre.\" He paused, and because I couldn\u0027t help it, I said, \"Who else?\" \"Gervaise is dead. Eric, Pam, Bill...burned, but here. Cleo Babbitt is here. I haven\u0027t seen Rasul.\" \"Is Jake Purifoy there?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen him, either.\" \"Because you might want to know he\u0027s at least partially responsible if you do see him. He was in on the Fellowship plot.\" \"Ah.\" Mr. Cataliades registered that. \"Oh, yes, I certainly did want to know that. Johan Glassport will be especially interested, since he has several broken ribs and a broken collarbone. He\u0027s very, very angry.\" It said something about Johan Glassport\u0027s viciousness, that Mr. Cataliades thought him capable of exacting as much vengeance as a vampire would. \"How did you come to know there was a plot at all, Miss Sookie?\" I told the lawyer the story Clovache had told me; I figured now that she and Batanya had gone back to wherever they came from, that would be okay. \"Hiring them proved to be worth the money for King Isaiah.\" Cataliades sounded thoughtful rather than envious. \"Isaiah is here and completely uninjured.\" \"We need to go find somewhere to sleep. Can you tell Barry\u0027s king that he\u0027s with me?\" I asked, knowing I needed to get off the phone and make a plan. \"He is too injured to care. He is not aware.\" \"All right. Just someone from the Texas party.\" \"I see Joseph Velasquez. Rachel is dead.\" Mr. Cataliades couldn\u0027t help himself; he had to tell me all the bad news. \"Cecile, Stan\u0027s assistant, is dead,\" I told him. \"Where are you going to go?\" Cataliades asked. \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" I said. I felt exhausted and hopeless, and I\u0027d had too much bad news and gotten too battered to rally one more time. \"I will send a cab for you,\" Mr. Cataliades offered. \"I can get a number from one of the nice volunteers. Tell the driver you are rescue workers and you need a ride to the nearest inexpensive hotel. Do you have a credit card?\" \"Yeah, and my debit card,\" I said, blessing the impulse that had led me to stuff the little wallet in my pocket. \"No, wait, they\u0027ll track you very easily if you use it. Cash?\" I checked. Thanks largely to Barry, we had a hundred ninety dollars between us. I told Mr. Cataliades we could swing it. \"Then spend the night in a hotel, and tomorrow call me again,\" he said, sounding unutterably weary. \"Thanks for the plan.\" \"Thanks for your warning,\" the courtly demon said. \"We would all be dead if you and the Bellboy hadn\u0027t wakened us.\" I ditched the yellow jacket and the hard hat. Barry and I tottered along, more or less holding each other up. We found a concrete barricade to lean against, our arms around each other. I tried to tell Barry why we were doing this, but he didn\u0027t care. I was worried that at any minute some firefighter or cop from the scene would spot us and stop to find out what we were doing, where we were going, who we were. I was so relieved that I felt sick when I spied a cab cruising slowly, the driver peering out the window. Had to be for us. I waved my free arm frantically. I had never hailed a cab before in my life. It was just like the movies. The cab driver, a wire-thin guy from Guyana, wasn\u0027t too excited about letting filthy creatures like us get into his cab, but he couldn\u0027t turn down people as pitiful as we were. The nearest \"inexpensive\" hotel was a mile back into the city, away from the water. If we\u0027d had the energy, we could have walked it. At least the cab ride wasn\u0027t too pricey. Even at the mid-range hotel, the desk clerks were less than thrilled with our appearance; but after all, it was a day for charity to people who were involved in the blast. We got a room at a price that would have made me gasp if I hadn\u0027t seen the room rates at the Pyramid. The room itself wasn\u0027t much, but we didn\u0027t need much. A maid knocked on the door right after we got in and said she\u0027d like to wash our clothes for us, since we didn\u0027t have any more. She looked down when she said that, so she wouldn\u0027t embarrass me. Trying not to choke up at her kindness, I looked down at my shirt and slacks and agreed. I turned to Barry to find he was absolutely out cold. I maneuvered him into the bed. It was unpleasantly like handling one of the vampires, and I held my lips pressed together in a tight line the whole time I undressed his limp body. Then I shucked my own clothes, found a plastic bag in the closet to hold them, and handed the soiled clothes out to her. I got a washcloth and wiped off Barry\u0027s face and hands and feet, and then I covered him up. I had to shower, and I thanked God for the complimentary shampoo and soap and cream rinse and skin lotion. I also thanked God for hot and cold running water, particularly hot. The kind maid had even handed me two toothbrushes and a little packet of toothpaste, and I scrubbed my mouth clean of the flavor of ashes. I washed my panties and bra in the sink and rolled them up in a towel before I hung them up to dry. I\u0027d given the lady every stitch of Barry\u0027s clothes. Finally, there was nothing else to do, and I crawled into the bed beside Barry. Now that I smelled so good, I noticed that he didn\u0027t, but that was just tough for me, right? I wouldn\u0027t have woken him for anything. I turned on my side away from him, thought about how frightening that long, empty corridor had been - isn\u0027t it funny that that was what I picked out as scary, after such a horrific day? The hotel room was so very quiet after the tumult of the scene of the explosions, and the bed was so very comfortable, and I smelled so much better and hardly hurt at all. I slept and didn\u0027t dream.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-together-dead-sookie-stackhouse-7/page-17.html","bookId":2197,"book":{"id":2197,"title":"All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7)","description":"Storyline: All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7) Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has her hands full dealing with every sort of undead and paranormal creature imaginable.
