{"id":101289,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET OUT OF THE CROWD IN THE wedding hall that I collided with a vampire, who whirled and grabbed my shoulders in a blur of darkness. He had a long Fu Manchu mustache and a mane of hair that would have done a couple of horses credit. He was wearing a solid black suit. At another time, I might have enjoyed the total package. Now I just wanted him to move.\n \"Why in such a hurry, my sweet maid?\" he asked.\n \"Sir,\" I said politely, since he must be older than I, \"I really am in a hurry. Excuse me for bumping into you, but I need to leave.\"\n \"You\u0027re not a donor, by any chance?\"\n \"Nope, sorry.\"\n Abruptly he let go of my shoulders and turned back to the conversation I\u0027d interrupted. With a great wave of relief, I continued to pick my way through the assemblage, though with more care now that I\u0027d already had one tense moment.\n \"There you are!\" Andre said, and he almost sounded cross. \"The queen needs you.\"\n I had to remind myself that I was there to work, and it really didn\u0027t matter how much inner drama I was experiencing. I followed Andre over to the queen, who was in conversation with a knot of vamps and humans.\n \"Of course I am on your side, Sophie,\" said a female vampire. She was wearing an evening gown of pink chiffon joined at one shoulder with a big broach sparkling with diamonds. They might be Swarovski crystals, but they looked real to me. What do I know? The pale pink looked real pretty against her chocolate skin. \"Arkansas was an asshole, anyway. I was only astonished that you married him in the first place.\"\n \"So if I come to trial, you will be kind, Alabama?\" Sophie-Anne asked, and you would have sworn she wasn\u0027t a day over sixteen. Her upturned face was smooth and firm, her big eyes gleamed, her makeup was subtle. Her brown hair was loose, which was unusual for Sophie-Anne.\n The vamp seemed to soften visibly. \"Of course,\" she said.\n Her human companion, the designer-clad fangbanger I\u0027d noticed earlier, thought, That\u0027ll last ten minutes, until she turns her back on Sophie-Anne. Then they\u0027ll be plotting again. Sure, they all say they like crackling fires and long walks on the beach by moonlight, but whenever you go to a party, it\u0027s maneuver, maneuver, maneuver, and lie, lie, lie.\n Sophie-Anne\u0027s gaze just brushed mine, and I gave a tiny shake of my head. Alabama excused herself to go congratulate the newlyweds, and her human tagged along. Mindful of all the ears around us, most of which could hear far better than I could, I said, \"Later,\" and got a nod from Andre.\n Next to court Sophie-Anne was the King of Kentucky, the man who was guarded by Britlingens. Kentucky turned out to look a lot like Davy Crockett. All he needed was a ba\u0027ar and a coonskin cap. He was actually wearing leather pants and a suede shirt and jacket, fringed suede boots, and a big silk kerchief tied around his neck. Maybe he needed the bodyguards to protect him from the fashion police.\n I didn\u0027t see Batanya and Clovache anywhere, so I assumed he\u0027d left them in his room. I didn\u0027t see what good it was to hire expensive and otherworldly bodyguards if they weren\u0027t around your body to guard it. Then, since I didn\u0027t have another human to distract me, I noticed something odd: there was a space behind Kentucky that stayed constantly empty, no matter what the flow of the crowd might be. No matter how natural it would be for someone passing behind Kentucky to step in that area, somehow no one ever did. I figured the Britlingens were on duty, after all.\n \"Sophie-Anne, you\u0027re a sight for sore eyes,\" said Kentucky. He had a drawl that was thick as honey, and he made a point of letting Sophie-Anne see his fangs were partially out. Ugh.\n \"Isaiah, it\u0027s always good to see you,\" Sophie-Anne said, her voice and face smooth and calm as always. I couldn\u0027t tell whether or not Sophie-Anne knew the bodyguards were right behind him. As I drew a little closer, I found that though I couldn\u0027t see Clovache and Batanya, I could pick up their mental signatures. The same magic that cloaked their physical presence also muffled their brain waves, but I could get a dull echo off both of them. I smiled at them, which was really dumb of me, because Isaiah, King of Kentucky, picked up on it right away. I should have known he was smarter than he looked.\n \"Sophie-Anne, I want to have a chat with you, but you gotta get that little blond gal out of here for the duration,\" Kentucky said with a broad grin. \"She pure-dee gives me the willies.\" He nodded toward me, as if Sophie-Anne had lots of blond human women trailing her.\n \"Of course, Isaiah,\" Sophie-Anne said, giving me a very level look. \"Sookie, please go down to the lower level and fetch the suitcase the staff called about earlier.\"\n \"Sure,\" I said. I didn\u0027t mind a humble errand. I\u0027d almost forgotten the gruff voice on the phone earlier in the evening. I thought it was stupid that procedure required us to come down to the bowels of the hotel, rather than allowing a bellman to bring us the suitcase, but red tape is the same everywhere you go, right?\n As I turned to go, Andre\u0027s face was quite blank, as usual, but when I was almost out of earshot, he said, \"Excuse me, your majesty, we didn\u0027t tell the girl about your schedule for the night.\" In one of those disconcerting flashes of movement, he was right beside me, hand on my arm. I wondered if he\u0027d gotten one of those telepathic communications from Sophie-Anne. Without a word, Sigebert had moved into Andre\u0027s place beside Sophie-Anne, a half step back.\n \"Let\u0027s talk,\" said Andre, and quick as a wink he guided me to an EXIT sign. We found ourselves in a blank beige service corridor that extended for maybe ten yards, then made a right-angle turn. Two laden waiters came around the corner and passed us, giving us curious glances, but when they met Andre\u0027s eyes they hurried away on their task.\n \"The Britlingens are there,\" I said, assuming that was why Andre had wanted to talk to me in private. \"They\u0027re trailing right behind Kentucky. Can all Britlingens become invisible?\"\n Andre did another movement that was so fast it was a blur, and then his wrist was in front of me, dripping blood. \"Drink,\" he said, and I felt him pushing at my mind.\n \"No,\" I said, outraged and shocked at the sudden movement, the demand, the blood. \"Why?\" I tried to back away, but there was no place to go and no help in sight.\n \"You have to have a stronger connection to Sophie-Anne or me. We need you bound to us by more than a paycheck. Already you\u0027ve proved more valuable than we\u0027d imagined. This summit is critical to our survival, and we need every advantage we can get.\"\n Talk about brutal honesty.\n \"I don\u0027t want you to have control over me,\" I told him, and it was awful to hear my voice going wavery with fear. \"I don\u0027t want you to know how I\u0027m feeling. I got hired for this job, and after it, I\u0027m going back to my real life.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have a real life anymore,\" Andre said. He didn\u0027t look unkind; that was the weird, and most frightening, thing. He looked absolutely matter-of-fact.\n \"I do! You guys are the blip on the radar, not me!\" I wasn\u0027t totally sure what I meant by that, but Andre got my drift.\n \"I don\u0027t care what your plans are for the rest of your human existence,\" he said, and shrugged. Phooey for your life. \"Our position will be strengthened if you drink, so you must. I\u0027ve explained this to you, which I wouldn\u0027t bother to do if I didn\u0027t respect your ability.\"\n I pushed at him, but it was like shoving an elephant. It would work only if the elephant felt like moving. Andre didn\u0027t. His wrist came closer to my mouth, and I clamped my lips together, though I was sure Andre would break my teeth if he had to. And if I opened my mouth to scream, he\u0027d have that blood in my mouth before you could say Jack Robinson.\n Suddenly there was a third presence in the stark beige corridor. Eric, still wearing the black velvet cape, hood thrown back, was standing right by us, his face uncharacteristically uncertain.\n \"Andre,\" he said, his voice sounding deeper than usual. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n \"Are you questioning the will of your queen?\"\n Eric was in a bad place, because he was definitely interfering with the execution of the queen\u0027s orders - at least, I assumed the queen knew about this - but I could only pray he stayed to help me. I begged him with my eyes.\n I could name several vamps I\u0027d rather have a connection to than Andre. And, stupidly, I couldn\u0027t help but feel hurt. I\u0027d given Andre and Sophie-Anne such a good idea about him being King of Arkansas, and this was the way I got repaid. That would teach me to keep my mouth shut. That would teach me to treat vampires like they were people.\n \"Andre, let me offer a suggestion,\" Eric said in a much cooler, calmer voice. Good. He was keeping his head together. One of us needed to. \"She must be kept happy, or she won\u0027t cooperate anymore.\"\n Oh, crap. Somehow I knew his suggestion wasn\u0027t going to be, \"Let her go or I\u0027ll break your neck,\" because Eric was way too canny for that. Where was John Wayne when you needed him? Or Bruce Willis? Or even Matt Damon? I would be glad to see Jason Bourne right now.\n \"We\u0027ve exchanged blood several times, Sookie and I,\" Eric said. \"In fact, we\u0027ve been lovers.\" He took a step closer. \"I think she wouldn\u0027t be so balky if I were the blood giver. Would that suit your purposes? I\u0027m under oath to you.\" He bowed his head respectfully. He was being careful, so careful. That made me more frightened of Andre.\n Andre let me go while he pondered. His wrist had almost healed up, anyway. I took a few long, shaky breaths. My heart was racing.\n Andre looked at Eric, and I thought I could detect a certain amount of distrust in his gaze. Then he looked at me.\n \"You look like a rabbit hiding under a bush while the fox tracks her,\" he said. There was a long pause. \"You did do my queen and me a large service,\" he said. \"More than once. If the end result will be the same, why not?\"\n I started to say, \"And I\u0027m the only witness to Peter Threadgill\u0027s death,\" but my guardian angel shut my mouth to seal in the words. Well, maybe it wasn\u0027t my actual guardian angel, but my subconscious, which told me not to speak. Whatever. I was grateful.\n \"All right, Eric,\" Andre said. \"As long as she\u0027s bonded to someone in our kingdom. I\u0027ve only had a drop of her blood, to find out if she was part fae. If you\u0027ve exchanged blood with her more than once, the bond is already strong. Has she answered well to your call?\"\n What? What call? When? Eric had never called me. In fact, I\u0027d out and out defied him before.\n \"Yes, she heels nicely,\" Eric said without a blink of an eye. I about choked, but that would have ruined the effect of Eric\u0027s words, so I looked down at my chest as if I was embarrassed by my thralldom.\n \"Well, then,\" Andre said with an impatient gesture of his hand. \"Go on.\"\n \"Right here? I\u0027d prefer somewhere more private,\" Eric said.\n \"Here and now.\" Andre was not going to compromise any further.\n Eric said, \"Sookie.\" He looked at me intently.\n I looked right back at him. I understood what that one word was saying. There was no way out of this. No struggling or screaming or refusal would prevent this procedure. Eric might have spared me from submitting to Andre, but that was as far as he could go.\n Eric raised one eyebrow.\n With that arched eyebrow, Eric was telling me that this was my best bet, that he would try not to hurt me, that being tied to him was infinitely preferable to being tied to Andre.\n I knew all this not only because I wasn\u0027t stupid, but because we were bound together. Both Eric and Bill had had my blood, and I theirs. For the first time, I understood there was a real connection. Didn\u0027t I see the two of them as more human than vampire? Didn\u0027t they have the power to wound me more than any others? It wasn\u0027t only my past relationships with the two that kept me tied to them. It was the blood exchange. Maybe because of my unusual heritage, they couldn\u0027t order me around. They didn\u0027t have mind control over me, and they couldn\u0027t read my thoughts; and I couldn\u0027t do any of those things to them. But we did share a tie. How often had I heard their lives humming away in the background, without realizing what I was listening to?\n It takes way longer to tell this than it did to think it.\n \"Eric,\" I said, and tilted my head to one side. He read as much from the gesture and word as I had from his. He stepped over to me and extended his arms to hold the black cloak out as he leaned over me, so the cloak and the hood could give us some illusion of privacy. The gesture was hokey, but the idea was nice. \"Eric, no sex,\" I said in a voice as hard as I could make it. I could tolerate this if it wasn\u0027t like a lovers\u0027 blood exchange. I wouldn\u0027t have sex in front of another person. Eric\u0027s mouth was in the bend of my neck and shoulder, and his body pressed against mine. My arms slid around him, because that was simply the easiest way to stand. Then he bit, and I couldn\u0027t choke back a gasp of pain.\n He didn\u0027t stop, thank God, because I wanted to get this over with. One of his hands stroked my back as if he was trying to soothe me.\n After a long few seconds, Eric licked my neck to be sure his coagulant-laden saliva had coated the little wounds. \"Now, Sookie,\" he said right into my ear. I couldn\u0027t reach his neck unless we were lying down, not without him bending over awkwardly. He started to hold his wrist up to my mouth, but we\u0027d have to rearrange ourselves for that to work. I unbuttoned his shirt and pushed it open. I hesitated. I always hated this part, because human teeth are not nearly as sharp as vampire teeth, and I knew it would be messy when I bit. Eric did something that surprised me, then; he produced the same small ceremonial knife he\u0027d used in marrying Mississippi and Indiana. With the same quick motion he\u0027d used on their wrists, Eric sliced a cut in his chest right below his nipple. The blood oozed out sluggishly, and I took advantage of the flow to latch on. This was embarrassingly intimate, but at least I didn\u0027t have to look at Andre, and he couldn\u0027t see me.\n Eric moved restlessly, and I realized he was getting aroused. There was nothing I could do about it, and I held our bodies apart that crucial couple of inches. I sucked hard, and Eric made a small noise, but I was strictly trying to get this over with. Vampire blood is thick and almost sweet, but when you think about what you\u0027re actually doing and you\u0027re not sexually aroused, it\u0027s not pleasant at all. When I thought I\u0027d done it long enough, I let go and rebuttoned Eric\u0027s shirt with unsteady hands, thinking this little incident was over and I could hide somewhere until my heart stopped pounding.\n And then Quinn flung open the door and stepped into the corridor.\n \"What the hell are you doing?\" he roared, and I wasn\u0027t sure if he meant me, or Eric, or Andre.\n \"They are obeying orders,\" Andre said sharply.\n \"My woman doesn\u0027t have to take orders from you,\" Quinn said.\n I opened my mouth to protest, but under these circumstances, it was hard to hand Quinn the line that I could take care of myself.\n There was no social guideline to cover a calamity like this, and even my grandmother\u0027s all-purpose rule of etiquette (\"Do what will make everyone most comfortable\") could not remotely stretch to encompass my situation. I wondered what Dear Abby would say.\n \"Andre,\" I said, trying to sound firm instead of cowed and scared, \"I\u0027ll finish the job I undertook to do for the queen here, because I shook on it. But I\u0027ll never work for you two again. Eric, thank you for making that as pleasant for me as you could.\" (Though pleasant hardly seemed the right word.)\n Eric had staggered a step over to lean against the wall. He\u0027d allowed the cloak to fall open, and the stain on his pants was clearly visible. \"Oh, no problem,\" Eric said dreamily.\n That didn\u0027t help. I suspected he was doing it on purpose. I felt heat rise in my cheeks. \"Quinn, I\u0027ll talk to you later, as we agreed,\" I snapped. Then I hesitated. \"That is, if you\u0027re still willing to talk to me.\" I thought, but couldn\u0027t say because it would have been too grossly unfair, that it would have been more help to me if he\u0027d come ten minutes earlier...or not at all.\n Looking neither to the right nor the left, I made myself march down that hall, took the right-angle turn, and walked through a swinging doorway directly into the kitchen.\n This clearly wasn\u0027t where I wanted to be, but at least it was away from the three men in the hall. \"Where\u0027s the baggage area?\" I asked the first uniformed staff person I saw. She was a server loading glasses of synthetic blood onto a huge round tray, and she didn\u0027t pause in her task but nodded her head toward a door in the south wall marked EXIT. I was taking a lot of those this evening.\n This door was heavier and led to a flight of stairs descending to a lower level, which I figured was actually under the ground. We don\u0027t have basements where I come from (the water table\u0027s too high), so it gave me a little frisson to be below street level.\n I\u0027d been walking as if something was chasing me, which in a nonliteral way was absolutely true, and I\u0027d been thinking about the damn suitcase so I wouldn\u0027t have to think about anything else. But when I reached the landing, I came a complete stop.\n Now that I was out of sight and truly alone, I took a moment to stand still, one hand resting against the wall. I let myself react to what had just happened. I began shaking, and when I touched my neck, I realized my collar felt funny. I pulled the material out and away and did a sort of sideways downward squinch to have a look at it. The collar was stained with my blood. Tears began flooding my eyes, and I sank to my haunches on the landing of that bleak staircase in a city far from home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-together-dead-sookie-stackhouse-7/page-11.html","bookId":2197,"book":{"id":2197,"title":"All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7) \n Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has her hands full dealing with every sort of undead and paranormal creature imaginable.
