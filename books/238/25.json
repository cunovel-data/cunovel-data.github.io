{"id":7283,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"25:1 [hgb] 人 若 有 争 讼 ， 来 听 审 判 ， 审 判 官 就 要 定 义 人 有 理 ， 定 恶 人 有 罪 。 [kjv] If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked. [bbe] If there is an argument between men and they go to law with one another, let the judges give their decision for the upright, and against the wrongdoer. 25:2 [hgb] 恶 人 若 该 受 责 打 ， 审 判 官 就 要 叫 他 当 面 伏 在 地 上 ， 按 着 他 的 罪 照 数 责 打 。 [kjv] And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number. [bbe] And if the wrongdoer is to undergo punishment by whipping, the judge will give orders for him to go down on his face and be whipped before him, the number of the blows being in relation to his crime. 25:3 [hgb] 只 可 打 他 四 十 下 ， 不 可 过 数 。 若 过 数 ， 便 是 轻 贱 你 的 弟 兄 了 。 [kjv] Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee. [bbe] He may be given forty blows, not more; for if more are given, your brother may be shamed before you. 25:4 [hgb] 牛 在 场 上 踹 谷 的 时 候 ， 不 可 笼 住 它 的 嘴 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. [bbe] Do not keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it. 25:5 [hgb] 弟 兄 同 居 ， 若 死 了 一 个 ， 没 有 儿 子 ， 死 人 的 妻 不 可 出 嫁 外 人 ， 她 丈 夫 的 兄 弟 当 尽 弟 兄 的 本 分 ， 娶 她 为 妻 ， 与 她 同 房 。 [kjv] If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband\u0027s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband\u0027s brother unto her. [bbe] If brothers are living together and one of them, at his death, has no son, the wife of the dead man is not to be married outside the family to another man: let her husband\u0027s brother go in to her and make her his wife, doing as it is right for a brother-in-law to do. 25:6 [hgb] 妇 人 生 的 长 子 必 归 死 兄 的 名 下 ， 免 得 他 的 名 在 以 色 列 中 涂 抹 了 。 [kjv] And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel. [bbe] Then the first male child she has will take the rights of the brother who is dead, so that his name may not come to an end in Israel. 25:7 [hgb] 那 人 若 不 愿 意 娶 他 哥 哥 的 妻 ， 他 哥 哥 的 妻 就 要 到 城 门 长 老 那 里 ， 说 ， 我 丈 夫 的 兄 弟 不 肯 在 以 色 列 中 兴 起 他 哥 哥 的 名 字 ， 不 给 我 尽 弟 兄 的 本 分 。 [kjv] And if the man like not to take his brother\u0027s wife, then let his brother\u0027s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband\u0027s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband\u0027s brother. [bbe] But if the man says he will not take his brother\u0027s wife, then let the wife go to the responsible men of the town, and say, My husband\u0027s brother will not keep his brother\u0027s name living in Israel; he will not do what it is right for a husband\u0027s brother to do. 25:8 [hgb] 本 城 的 长 老 就 要 召 那 人 来 问 他 ， 他 若 执 意 说 ， 我 不 愿 意 娶 她 ， [kjv] Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her; [bbe] Then the responsible men of the town will send for the man, and have talk with him: and if he still says, I will not take her; 25:9 [hgb] 他 哥 哥 的 妻 就 要 当 着 长 老 到 那 人 的 跟 前 ， 脱 了 他 的 鞋 ， 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 ， 说 ， 凡 不 为 哥 哥 建 立 家 室 的 都 要 这 样 待 他 。 [kjv] Then shall his brother\u0027s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother\u0027s house. [bbe] Then his brother\u0027s wife is to come to him, before the responsible men of the town, and take his shoe off his foot, and put shame on him, and say, So let it be done to the man who will not take care of his brother\u0027s name. 25:10 [hgb] 在 以 色 列 中 ， 他 的 名 必 称 为 脱 鞋 之 家 。 [kjv] And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed. [bbe] And his family will be named in Israel, The house of him whose shoe has been taken off. 25:11 [hgb] 若 有 二 人 争 斗 ， 这 人 的 妻 近 前 来 ， 要 救 她 丈 夫 脱 离 那 打 她 丈 夫 之 人 的 手 ， 抓 住 那 人 的 下 体 ， [kjv] When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: [bbe] If two men are fighting, and the wife of one of them, coming to the help of her husband, takes the other by the private parts; 25:12 [hgb] 就 要 砍 断 妇 人 的 手 ， 眼 不 可 顾 惜 她 。 [kjv] Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her. [bbe] Her hand is to be cut off; have no pity on her. 25:13 [hgb] 你 囊 中 不 可 有 一 大 一 小 两 样 的 法 码 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. [bbe] Do not have in your bag different weights, a great and a small; 25:14 [hgb] 你 家 里 不 可 有 一 大 一 小 两 样 的 升 斗 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. [bbe] Or in your house different measures, a great and a small. 25:15 [hgb] 当 用 对 准 公 平 的 法 码 ， 公 平 的 升 斗 。 这 样 ， 在 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 的 地 上 ， 你 的 日 子 就 可 以 长 久 。 [kjv] But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. [bbe] But have a true weight and a true measure: so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. 25:16 [hgb] 因 为 行 非 义 之 事 的 人 都 是 耶 和 华 你 神 所 憎 恶 的 。 [kjv] For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God. [bbe] For all who do such things, and all whose ways are not upright, are disgusting to the Lord your God. 25:17 [hgb] 你 要 记 念 你 们 出 埃 及 的 时 候 ， 亚 玛 力 人 在 路 上 怎 样 待 你 。 [kjv] Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; [bbe] Keep in mind what Amalek did to you on your way from Egypt; 25:18 [hgb] 他 们 在 路 上 遇 见 你 ， 趁 你 疲 乏 困 倦 击 杀 你 尽 后 边 软 弱 的 人 ， 并 不 敬 畏 神 。 [kjv] How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. [bbe] How, meeting you on the way, he made an attack on you when you were tired and without strength, cutting off all the feeble ones at the end of your line; and the fear of God was not in him. 25:19 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 你 神 使 你 不 被 四 围 一 切 的 仇 敌 扰 乱 ， 在 耶 和 华 你 神 赐 你 为 业 的 地 上 得 享 平 安 。 那 时 ， 你 要 将 亚 玛 力 的 名 号 从 天 下 涂 抹 了 ， 不 可 忘 记 。 [kjv] Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it. [bbe] So when the Lord your God has given you rest from all who are against you on every side, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, see to it that the memory of Amalek is cut off from the earth; keep this in mind.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/532.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
