And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, [bbe] And Moses went up from the table-lands of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah which is facing Jericho. And the Lord let him see all the land, the land of Gilead as far as Dan; 34:2 [hgb] 拿 弗 他 利 全 地 ， 以 法 莲 ， 玛 拿 西 的 地 ， 犹 大 全 地 直 到 西 海 ， [kjv] And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, [bbe] And all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, as far as the Great Sea of the west; 34:3 [hgb] 南 地 和 棕 树 城 耶 利 哥 的 平 原 ， 直 到 琐 珥 ， 都 指 给 他 看 。 [kjv] And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. [bbe] And the South, and the circle of the valley of Jericho, the town of palm-trees, as far as Zoar. 34:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 他 说 ， 这 就 是 我 向 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 起 誓 应 许 之 地 。 说 ， 我 必 将 这 地 赐 给 你 的 后 裔 。 现 在 我 使 你 眼 睛 看 见 了 ， 你 却 不 得 过 到 那 里 去 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. [bbe] And the Lord said to him, This is the land about which I made an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: now I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not go in there. 34:5 [hgb] 于 是 ， 耶 和 华 的 仆 人 摩 西 死 在 摩 押 地 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 [kjv] So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. [bbe] So death came to Moses, the servant of the Lord, there in the land of Moab, as the Lord had said. 34:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 将 他 埋 葬 在 摩 押 地 ， 伯 毗 珥 对 面 的 谷 中 ， 只 是 到 今 日 没 有 人 知 道 他 的 坟 墓 。 [kjv] And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. [bbe] And the Lord put him to rest in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor: but no man has knowledge of his resting-place to this day. 34:7 [hgb] 摩 西 死 的 时 候 年 一 百 二 十 岁 。 眼 目 没 有 昏 花 ， 精 神 没 有 衰 败 。 [kjv] And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. [bbe] And Moses at his death was a hundred and twenty years old: his eye had not become clouded, or his natural force become feeble. 34:8 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 在 摩 押 平 原 为 摩 西 哀 哭 了 三 十 日 ， 为 摩 西 居 丧 哀 哭 的 日 子 就 满 了 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. [bbe] For thirty days the children of Israel were weeping for Moses in the table-lands of Moab, till the days of weeping and sorrow for Moses were ended. 34:9 [hgb] 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 。 因 为 摩 西 曾 按 手 在 他 头 上 ， 就 被 智 慧 的 灵 充 满 ， 以 色 列 人 便 听 从 他 ， 照 着 耶 和 华 吩 咐 摩 西 的 行 了 。 [kjv] And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. [bbe] And Joshua, the son of Nun, was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had put his hands on him: and the children of Israel gave ear to him, and did as the Lord had given orders to Moses. 34:10 [hgb] 以 后 以 色 列 中 再 没 有 兴 起 先 知 像 摩 西 的 。 他 是 耶 和 华 面 对 面 所 认 识 的 。 [kjv] And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, [bbe] There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord had knowledge of face to face; 34:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 打 发 他 在 埃 及 地 向 法 老 和 他 的 一 切 臣 仆 ， 并 他 的 全 地 ， 行 各 样 神 迹 奇 事 ， [kjv] In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, [bbe] In all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land; 34:12 [hgb] 又 在 以 色 列 众 人 眼 前 显 大 能 的 手 ， 行 一 切 大 而 可 畏 的 事 。 [kjv] And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel. [bbe] And in all the acts of power and fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/541.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
