[bbe] Then Moses and the responsible men of Israel gave the people these orders: Keep all the orders which I have given you this day; 27:2 [hgb] 你 们 过 约 旦 河 ， 到 了 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 给 你 的 地 ， 当 天 要 立 起 几 块 大 石 头 ， 墁 上 石 灰 ， [kjv] And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister: [bbe] And on the day when you go over Jordan into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, put up great stones, coating them with building-paste, 27:3 [hgb] 把 这 律 法 的 一 切 话 写 在 石 头 上 。 你 过 了 河 ， 可 以 进 入 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 流 奶 与 蜜 之 地 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 你 列 祖 之 神 所 应 许 你 的 。 [kjv] And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee. [bbe] And writing on them all the words of this law, after you have gone over; so that you may take the heritage which the Lord your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has said. 27:4 [hgb] 你 们 过 了 约 旦 河 ， 就 要 在 以 巴 路 山 上 照 我 今 日 所 吩 咐 的 ， 将 这 些 石 头 立 起 来 ， 墁 上 石 灰 。 [kjv] Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister. [bbe] And when you have gone over Jordan, you are to put up these stones, as I have said to you today, in Mount Ebal, and have them coated with building-paste. 27:5 [hgb] 在 那 里 要 为 耶 和 华 你 的 神 筑 一 座 石 坛 。 在 石 头 上 不 可 动 铁 器 。 [kjv] And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them. [bbe] There you are to make an altar to the Lord your God, of stones on which no iron instrument has been used. 27:6 [hgb] 要 用 没 有 凿 过 的 石 头 筑 耶 和 华 你 神 的 坛 ， 在 坛 上 要 将 燔 祭 献 给 耶 和 华 你 的 神 。 [kjv] Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God: [bbe] You are to make the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones; offering on it burned offerings to the Lord your God: 27:7 [hgb] 又 要 献 平 安 祭 ， 且 在 那 里 吃 ， 在 耶 和 华 你 的 神 面 前 欢 乐 。 [kjv] And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God. [bbe] And you are to make your peace-offerings, feasting there with joy before the Lord your God. 27:8 [hgb] 你 要 将 这 律 法 的 一 切 话 明 明 地 写 在 石 头 上 。 [kjv] And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. [bbe] And put on the stones all the words of this law, writing them very clearly. 27:9 [hgb] 摩 西 和 祭 司 利 未 人 晓 谕 以 色 列 众 人 说 ， 以 色 列 阿 ， 要 默 默 静 听 。 你 今 日 成 为 耶 和 华 你 神 的 百 姓 了 。 [kjv] And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God. [bbe] Then Moses and the priests, the Levites, said to all Israel, Be quiet and give ear, O Israel; today you have become the people of the Lord your God. 27:10 [hgb] 所 以 要 听 从 耶 和 华 你 神 的 话 ， 遵 行 他 的 诫 命 律 例 ， 就 是 我 今 日 所 吩 咐 你 的 。 [kjv] Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
