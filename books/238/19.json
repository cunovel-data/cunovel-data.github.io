\\n\\n [bbe] When the nations, whose land the Lord your God is giving you, have been cut off by him, and you have taken their place and are living in their towns and in their houses; \\n\\n 19:2 [hgb] 就 要 在 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 为 业 的 地 上 分 定 三 座 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. \\n\\n [bbe] You are to have three towns marked out in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage. \\n\\n 19:3 [hgb] 要 将 耶 和 华 你 神 使 你 承 受 为 业 的 地 分 为 三 段 。 又 要 预 备 道 路 ， 使 误 杀 人 的 ， 都 可 以 逃 到 那 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither. \\n\\n [bbe] You are to make ready a way, and see that the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, is marked out into three parts, to which any taker of life may go in flight. \\n\\n 19:4 [hgb] 误 杀 人 的 逃 到 那 里 可 以 存 活 ， 定 例 乃 是 这 样 ， 凡 素 无 仇 恨 ， 无 心 杀 了 人 的 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past; \\n\\n [bbe] This is to be the rule for anyone who goes in flight there, after causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate; \\n\\n 19:5 [hgb] 就 如 人 与 邻 舍 同 入 树 林 砍 伐 树 木 ， 手 拿 斧 子 一 砍 ， 本 想 砍 下 树 木 ， 不 料 ， 斧 头 脱 了 把 ， 飞 落 在 邻 舍 身 上 ， 以 致 于 死 ， 这 人 逃 到 那 些 城 的 一 座 城 ， 就 可 以 存 活 ， \\n\\n [kjv] As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: \\n\\n [bbe] For example, if a man goes into the woods with his neighbour for the purpose of cutting down trees, and when he takes his axe to give a blow to the tree, the head of the axe comes off, and falling on to his neighbour gives him a wound causing his death; then the man may go in flight to one of these towns and be safe: \\n\\n 19:6 [hgb] 免 得 报 血 仇 的 ， 心 中 火 热 追 赶 他 ， 因 路 远 就 追 上 ， 将 他 杀 死 。 其 实 他 不 该 死 ， 因 为 他 与 被 杀 的 素 无 仇 恨 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. \\n\\n [bbe] For if not, he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath, and overtake him because the way is long, and give him a death-blow; though it is not right for him to be put to death because he was not moved by hate. \\n\\n 19:7 [hgb] 所 以 我 吩 咐 你 说 ， 要 分 定 三 座 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And so I am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose. \\n\\n 19:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 神 若 照 他 向 你 列 祖 所 起 的 誓 扩 张 你 的 境 界 ， 将 所 应 许 赐 你 列 祖 的 地 全 然 给 你 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; \\n\\n [bbe] And if the Lord your God makes wide the limits of your land, as he said in his oath to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers; \\n\\n 19:9 [hgb] 你 若 谨 守 遵 行 我 今 日 所 吩 咐 的 这 一 切 诫 命 ， 爱 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 常 常 遵 行 他 的 道 ， 就 要 在 这 三 座 城 之 外 ， 再 添 三 座 城 ， \\n\\n [kjv] If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three: \\n\\n [bbe] If you keep and do all these orders which I give you today, loving the Lord your God and walking ever in his ways; then let three more towns, in addition to these three, be marked out for you: \\n\\n 19:10 [hgb] 免 得 无 辜 之 人 的 血 流 在 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 为 业 的 地 上 ， 流 血 的 罪 就 归 于 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. \\n\\n [bbe] So that in all your land, which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, no man may be wrongly put to death, for which you will be responsible. \\n\\n 19:11 [hgb] 若 有 人 恨 他 的 邻 舍 ， 埋 伏 着 起 来 击 杀 他 ， 以 致 于 死 ， 便 逃 到 这 些 城 的 一 座 城 ， \\n\\n [kjv] But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities: \\n\\n [bbe] But if any man has hate for his neighbour, and waiting for him secretly makes an attack on him and gives him a blow causing his death, and then goes in flight to one of these towns; \\n\\n 19:12 [hgb] 本 城 的 长 老 就 要 打 发 人 去 ， 从 那 里 带 出 他 来 ， 交 在 报 血 仇 的 手 中 ， 将 他 治 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. \\n\\n [bbe] The responsible men of his town are to send and take him, and give him up to the one who has the right of punishment to be put to death. \\n\\n 19:13 [hgb] 你 眼 不 可 顾 惜 他 ， 却 要 从 以 色 列 中 除 掉 流 无 辜 血 的 罪 ， 使 你 可 以 得 福 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Have no pity on him, so that Israel may be clear from the crime of putting a man to death without cause, and it will be well for you. \\n\\n 19:14 [hgb] 在 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 承 受 为 业 之 地 ， 不 可 挪 移 你 邻 舍 的 地 界 ， 那 是 先 人 所 定 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour\u0027s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. \\n\\n [bbe] Your neighbour\u0027s landmark, which was put in its place by the men of old times, is not to be moved or taken away in the land of your heritage which the Lord your God is giving you. \\n\\n 19:15 [hgb] 人 无 论 犯 什 么 罪 ， 作 什 么 恶 ， 不 可 凭 一 个 人 的 口 作 见 证 ， 总 要 凭 两 三 个 人 的 口 作 见 证 才 可 定 案 。 \\n\\n [kjv] One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established. \\n\\n [bbe] One witness may not make a statement against a man in relation to any sin or wrongdoing which he has done: on the word of two or three witnesses a question is to be judged. \\n\\n 19:16 [hgb] 若 有 凶 恶 的 见 证 人 起 来 ， 见 证 某 人 作 恶 ， \\n\\n [kjv] If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong; \\n\\n [bbe] If a false witness makes a statement against a man, saying that he has done wrong, \\n\\n 19:17 [hgb] 这 两 个 争 讼 的 人 就 要 站 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 和 当 时 的 祭 司 ， 并 审 判 官 面 前 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days; \\n\\n [bbe] Then the two men, between whom the argument has taken place, are to come before the Lord, before the priests and judges who are then in power; \\n\\n 19:18 [hgb] 审 判 官 要 细 细 地 查 究 ， 若 见 证 人 果 然 是 作 假 见 证 的 ， 以 假 见 证 陷 害 弟 兄 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; \\n\\n [bbe] And the judges will have the question looked into with care: and if the witness is seen to be false and to have made a false statement against his brother, \\n\\n 19:19 [hgb] 你 们 就 要 待 他 如 同 他 想 要 待 的 弟 兄 。 这 样 ， 就 把 那 恶 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. \\n\\n [bbe] Then do to him what it was his purpose to do to his brother: and so put away the evil from among you. \\n\\n 19:20 [hgb] 别 人 听 见 都 要 害 怕 ， 就 不 敢 在 你 们 中 间 再 行 这 样 的 恶 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you. \\n\\n [bbe] And the rest of the people, hearing of it, will be full of fear, and never again do such evil among you. \\n\\n 19:21 [hgb] 你 眼 不 可 顾 惜 ， 要 以 命 偿 命 ， 以 眼 还 眼 ， 以 牙 还 牙 ， 以 手 还 手 ， 以 脚 还 脚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. \\n\\n [bbe] Have no pity; let life be given for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/526.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
