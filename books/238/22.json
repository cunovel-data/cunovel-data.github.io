and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother\u0027s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself. \\n\\n [bbe] Do the same with his ass or his robe or anything which has gone from your brother\u0027s keeping and which you have come across: do not keep it to yourself. \\n\\n 22:4 [hgb] 你 若 看 见 弟 兄 的 牛 或 驴 跌 倒 在 路 上 ， 不 可 佯 为 不 见 ， 总 要 帮 助 他 拉 起 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt not see thy brother\u0027s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. \\n\\n [bbe] If you see your brother\u0027s ox or his ass falling down on the road, do not go by without giving him help in lifting it up again. \\n\\n 22:5 [hgb] 妇 女 不 可 穿 戴 男 子 所 穿 戴 的 ， 男 子 也 不 可 穿 妇 女 的 衣 服 ， 因 为 这 样 行 都 是 耶 和 华 你 神 所 憎 恶 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman\u0027s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God. \\n\\n [bbe] It is not right for a woman to be dressed in man\u0027s clothing, or for a man to put on a woman\u0027s robe: whoever does such things is disgusting to the Lord your God. \\n\\n 22:6 [hgb] 你 若 路 上 遇 见 鸟 窝 ， 或 在 树 上 或 在 地 上 ， 里 头 有 雏 或 有 蛋 ， 母 鸟 伏 在 雏 上 或 在 蛋 上 ， 你 不 可 连 母 带 雏 一 并 取 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If a bird\u0027s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: \\n\\n [bbe] If by chance you see a place which a bird has made for itself in a tree or on the earth, with young ones or eggs, and the mother bird seated on the young ones or on the eggs, do not take the mother bird with the young: \\n\\n 22:7 [hgb] 总 要 放 母 ， 只 可 取 雏 ， 这 样 你 就 可 以 享 福 ， 日 子 得 以 长 久 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. \\n\\n [bbe] See that you let the mother bird go, but the young ones you may take; so it will be well for you and your life will be long. \\n\\n 22:8 [hgb] 你 若 建 造 房 屋 ， 要 在 房 上 的 四 围 安 栏 杆 ， 免 得 有 人 从 房 上 掉 下 来 ， 流 血 的 罪 就 归 于 你 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence. \\n\\n [bbe] If you are building a house, make a railing for the roof, so that the blood of any man falling from it will not come on your house. \\n\\n 22:9 [hgb] 不 可 把 两 样 种 子 种 在 你 的 葡 萄 园 里 ， 免 得 你 撒 种 所 结 的 和 葡 萄 园 的 果 子 都 要 充 公 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not have your vine-garden planted with two sorts of seed: or all of it may become a loss, the seed you have put in as well as the increase. \\n\\n 22:10 [hgb] 不 可 并 用 牛 ， 驴 耕 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not do your ploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together. \\n\\n 22:11 [hgb] 不 可 穿 羊 毛 ， 细 麻 两 样 搀 杂 料 作 的 衣 服 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not have clothing made of two sorts of thread, wool and linen together. \\n\\n 22:12 [hgb] 你 要 在 所 披 的 外 衣 上 四 围 作 ？ ？ 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself. \\n\\n [bbe] On the four edges of your robe, with which your body is covered, put ornaments of twisted threads. \\n\\n 22:13 [hgb] 人 若 娶 妻 ， 与 她 同 房 之 后 恨 恶 她 ， \\n\\n [kjv] If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, \\n\\n [bbe] If any man takes a wife, and having had connection with her, has no delight in her, \\n\\n 22:14 [hgb] 信 口 说 她 ， 将 丑 名 加 在 她 身 上 ， 说 ， 我 娶 了 这 女 子 ， 与 她 同 房 ， 见 她 没 有 贞 洁 的 凭 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: \\n\\n [bbe] And says evil things about her and gives her a bad name, saying, I took this woman, and when I had connection with her it was clear to me that she was not a virgin: \\n\\n 22:15 [hgb] 女 子 的 父 母 就 要 把 女 子 贞 洁 的 凭 据 拿 出 来 ， 带 到 本 城 门 长 老 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel\u0027s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: \\n\\n [bbe] Then let the girl\u0027s father and mother put before the responsible men of the town, in the public place, signs that the girl was a virgin: \\n\\n 22:16 [hgb] 女 子 的 父 亲 要 对 长 老 说 ， 我 将 我 的 女 儿 给 这 人 为 妻 ， 他 恨 恶 她 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the damsel\u0027s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; \\n\\n [bbe] And let the girl\u0027s father say to the responsible men, I gave my daughter to this man for his wife, but he has no love for her; \\n\\n 22:17 [hgb] 信 口 说 她 ， 说 ， 我 见 你 的 女 儿 没 有 贞 洁 的 凭 据 。 其 实 这 就 是 我 女 儿 贞 洁 的 凭 据 。 父 母 就 把 那 布 铺 在 本 城 的 长 老 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter\u0027s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. \\n\\n [bbe] And now he has put shame on her, saying that she is not a virgin; but here is the sign that she is a virgin. Then they are to put her clothing before the responsible men of the town. \\n\\n 22:18 [hgb] 本 城 的 长 老 要 拿 住 那 人 ， 惩 治 他 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; \\n\\n [bbe] Then the responsible men of the town are to give the man his punishment; \\n\\n 22:19 [hgb] 并 要 罚 他 一 百 舍 客 勒 银 子 ， 给 女 子 的 父 亲 ， 因 为 他 将 丑 名 加 在 以 色 列 的 一 个 处 女 身 上 。 女 子 仍 作 他 的 妻 ， 终 身 不 可 休 她 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. \\n\\n [bbe] They will take from him a hundred shekels of silver, which are to be given to the father of the girl, because he has given an evil name to a virgin of Israel: she will go on being his wife, he may never put her away all his life. \\n\\n 22:20 [hgb] 但 这 事 若 是 真 的 ， 女 子 没 有 贞 洁 的 凭 据 ， \\n\\n [kjv] But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: \\n\\n [bbe] But if what he has said is true, and she is seen to be not a virgin, \\n\\n 22:21 [hgb] 就 要 将 女 子 带 到 她 父 家 的 门 口 ， 本 城 的 人 要 用 石 头 将 她 打 死 。 因 为 她 在 父 家 行 了 淫 乱 ， 在 以 色 列 中 作 了 丑 事 。 这 样 ， 就 把 那 恶 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father\u0027s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father\u0027s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you. \\n\\n [bbe] Then they are to make the girl come to the door of her father\u0027s house and she will be stoned to death by the men of the town, because she has done evil and put shame on Israel, by acting as a loose woman in her father\u0027s house: so you are to put away evil from among you. \\n\\n 22:22 [hgb] 若 遇 见 人 与 有 丈 夫 的 妇 人 行 淫 ， 就 要 将 奸 夫 淫 妇 一 并 治 死 。 这 样 ， 就 把 那 恶 从 以 色 列 中 除 掉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] If a man is taken in the act of going in to a married woman, the two of them, the man as well as the woman, are to be put to death: so you are to put away the evil from Israel. \\n\\n 22:23 [hgb] 若 有 处 女 已 经 许 配 丈 夫 ， 有 人 在 城 里 遇 见 她 ， 与 她 行 淫 ， \\n\\n [kjv] If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; \\n\\n [bbe] If a young virgin has given her word to be married to a man, and another man meeting her in the town, has connection with her; \\n\\n 22:24 [hgb] 你 们 就 要 把 这 二 人 带 到 本 城 门 ， 用 石 头 打 死 女 子 是 因 为 虽 在 城 里 却 没 有 喊 叫 。 男 子 是 因 为 玷 污 别 人 的 妻 。 这 样 ， 就 把 那 恶 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour\u0027s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you. \\n\\n [bbe] Then you are to take the two of them to the doorway of the town, and have them stoned to death; the young virgin, because she gave no cry for help, though it was in the town, and the man, because he has put shame on his neighbour\u0027s wife: so you are to put away evil from among you. \\n\\n 22:25 [hgb] 若 有 男 子 在 田 野 遇 见 已 经 许 配 人 的 女 子 ， 强 与 她 行 淫 ， 只 要 将 那 男 子 治 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: \\n\\n [bbe] But if the man, meeting such a virgin in the open country, takes her by force, then only the man is to be put to death; \\n\\n 22:26 [hgb] 但 不 可 办 女 子 。 她 本 没 有 该 死 的 罪 ， 这 事 就 类 乎 人 起 来 攻 击 邻 舍 ， 将 他 杀 了 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: \\n\\n [bbe] Nothing is to be done to the virgin, because there is no cause of death in her: it is the same as if a man made an attack on his neighbour and put him to death: \\n\\n 22:27 [hgb] 因 为 男 子 是 在 田 野 遇 见 那 已 经 许 配 人 的 女 子 ， 女 子 喊 叫 ， 并 无 人 救 她 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. \\n\\n [bbe] For he came across her in the open country, and there was no one to come to the help of the virgin in answer to her cry. \\n\\n 22:28 [hgb] 若 有 男 子 遇 见 没 有 许 配 人 的 处 女 ， 抓 住 她 ， 与 她 行 淫 ， 被 人 看 见 ， \\n\\n [kjv] If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; \\n\\n [bbe] If a man sees a young virgin, who has not given her word to be married to anyone, and he takes her by force and has connection with her, and discovery is made of it; \\n\\n 22:29 [hgb] 这 男 子 就 要 拿 五 十 舍 客 勒 银 子 给 女 子 的 父 亲 。 因 他 玷 污 了 这 女 子 ， 就 要 娶 她 为 妻 ， 终 身 不 可 休 她 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel\u0027s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the man will have to give the virgin\u0027s father fifty shekels of silver and make her his wife, because he has put shame on her; he may never put her away all his life. \\n\\n 22:30 [hgb] 人 不 可 娶 继 母 为 妻 。 不 可 掀 开 他 父 亲 的 衣 襟 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A man shall not take his father\u0027s wife, nor discover his father\u0027s skirt. \\n\\n [bbe] A man may not take his father\u0027s wife or have sex relations with a woman who is his father\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/529.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
