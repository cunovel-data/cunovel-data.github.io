I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. \n [bbe] Then he said to them, I am now a hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to go out and come in: and the Lord has said to me, You are not to go over Jordan. \n 31:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 必 引 导 你 们 过 去 ， 将 这 些 国 民 在 你 们 面 前 灭 绝 ， 你 们 就 得 他 们 的 地 。 约 书 亚 必 引 导 你 们 过 去 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 \n [kjv] The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said. \n [bbe] The Lord your God, he will go over before you; he will send destruction on all those nations, and you will take their land as your heritage: and Joshua will go over at your head as the Lord has said. \n 31:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 待 他 们 ， 如 同 从 前 待 他 所 灭 绝 的 亚 摩 利 二 王 西 宏 与 噩 以 及 他 们 的 国 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed. \n [bbe] The Lord will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, whom he put to destruction. \n 31:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 将 他 们 交 给 你 们 。 你 们 要 照 我 所 吩 咐 的 一 切 命 令 待 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you. \n [bbe] The Lord will give them up into your hands, and you are to do to them as I have given you orders. \n 31:6 [hgb] 你 们 当 刚 强 壮 胆 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 也 不 要 畏 惧 他 们 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 你 的 神 和 你 同 去 。 他 必 不 撇 下 你 ， 也 不 丢 弃 你 。 \n [kjv] Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. \n [bbe] Be strong and take heart, and have no fear of them: for it is the Lord your God who is going with you; he will not take away his help from you. \n 31:7 [hgb] 摩 西 召 了 约 书 亚 来 ， 在 以 色 列 众 人 眼 前 对 他 说 ， 你 当 刚 强 壮 胆 。 因 为 ， 你 要 和 这 百 姓 一 同 进 入 耶 和 华 向 他 们 列 祖 起 誓 应 许 所 赐 之 地 。 你 也 要 使 他 们 承 受 那 地 为 业 。 \n [kjv] And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. \n [bbe] Then Moses sent for Joshua, and before the eyes of all Israel said to him, Be strong and take heart: for you are to go with this people into the land which the Lord, by his oath to their fathers, has given them; by your help they will take it for their heritage. \n 31:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 在 你 前 面 行 。 他 必 与 你 同 在 ， 必 不 撇 下 你 ， 也 不 丢 弃 你 。 不 要 惧 怕 ， 也 不 要 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. \n [bbe] It is the Lord who goes before you; he will be with you, he will not take away his help from you or give you up: so have no fear. \n 31:9 [hgb] 摩 西 将 这 律 法 写 出 来 ， 交 给 抬 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 祭 司 利 未 子 孙 和 以 色 列 的 众 长 老 。 \n [kjv] And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel. \n [bbe] Then Moses put all this law in writing, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who take up the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement, and to all the responsible men of Israel. \n 31:10 [hgb] 摩 西 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 每 逢 七 年 的 末 一 年 ， 就 在 豁 免 年 的 定 期 住 棚 节 的 时 候 ， \n [kjv] And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, \n [bbe] And Moses said to them, At the end of every seven years, at the time fixed for the ending of debts, at the feast of tents, \n 31:11 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 来 到 耶 和 华 你 神 所 选 择 的 地 方 朝 见 他 。 那 时 ， 你 要 在 以 色 列 众 人 面 前 将 这 律 法 念 给 他 们 听 。 \n [kjv] When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. \n [bbe] When all Israel has come before the Lord your God in the place named by him, let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all Israel. \n 31:12 [hgb] 要 招 聚 他 们 男 ， 女 ， 孩 子 ， 并 城 里 寄 居 的 ， 使 他 们 听 ， 使 他 们 学 习 ， 好 敬 畏 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 谨 守 ， 遵 行 这 律 法 的 一 切 话 ， \n [kjv] Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: \n [bbe] Make all the people come together, men and women and children, and anyone from another country who is with you, so that hearing they may become wise in the fear of the Lord your God, and take care to do all the words of this law; \n 31:13 [hgb] 也 使 他 们 未 曾 晓 得 这 律 法 的 儿 女 得 以 听 见 ， 学 习 敬 畏 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 在 你 们 过 约 旦 河 要 得 为 业 之 地 ， 存 活 的 日 子 ， 常 常 这 样 行 。 \n [kjv] And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. \n [bbe] And so that your children, to whom it is new, may give ear and be trained in the fear of the Lord your God, while you are living in the land which you are going over Jordan to take for your heritage. \n 31:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 的 死 期 临 近 了 。 要 召 约 书 亚 来 ， 你 们 二 人 站 在 会 幕 里 ， 我 好 嘱 咐 他 。 于 是 摩 西 和 约 书 亚 去 站 在 会 幕 里 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. \n [bbe] At that time the Lord said to Moses, The day of your death is near: send for Joshua, and come to the Tent of meeting so that I may give him his orders. So Moses and Joshua went to the Tent of meeting. \n 31:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 在 会 幕 里 云 柱 中 显 现 ， 云 柱 停 在 会 幕 门 以 上 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle. \n [bbe] And the Lord was seen in the Tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the Tent. \n 31:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 必 和 你 列 祖 同 睡 。 这 百 姓 要 起 来 ， 在 他 们 所 要 去 的 地 上 ， 在 那 地 的 人 中 ， 随 从 外 邦 神 行 邪 淫 ， 离 弃 我 ， 违 背 我 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Now you are going to rest with your fathers; and this people will be false to me, uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going; they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement I have made with them. \n 31:17 [hgb] 那 时 ， 我 的 怒 气 必 向 他 们 发 作 。 我 也 必 离 弃 他 们 ， 掩 面 不 顾 他 们 ， 以 致 他 们 被 吞 灭 ， 并 有 许 多 的 祸 患 灾 难 临 到 他 们 。 那 日 他 们 必 说 ， 这 些 祸 患 临 到 我 们 ， 岂 不 是 因 我 们 的 神 不 在 我 们 中 间 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us? \n [bbe] In that day my wrath will be moved against them, and I will be turned away from them, veiling my face from them, and destruction will overtake them, and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them; so that in that day they will say, Have not these evils come on us because our God is not with us? \n 31:18 [hgb] 那 时 ， 因 他 们 偏 向 别 神 所 行 的 一 切 恶 ， 我 必 定 掩 面 不 顾 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. \n [bbe] Truly, my face will be turned away from them in that day, because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods. \n 31:19 [hgb] 现 在 你 要 写 一 篇 歌 ， 教 导 以 色 列 人 ， 传 给 他 们 ， 使 这 歌 见 证 他 们 的 不 是 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. \n [bbe] Make then this song for yourselves, teaching it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. \n 31:20 [hgb] 因 为 我 将 他 们 领 进 我 向 他 们 列 祖 起 誓 应 许 那 流 奶 与 蜜 之 地 ， 他 们 在 那 里 吃 得 饱 足 ， 身 体 肥 胖 ， 就 必 偏 向 别 神 ， 事 奉 他 们 ， 藐 视 我 ， 背 弃 我 的 约 。 \n [kjv] For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. \n [bbe] For when I have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey, and they have made themselves full of food and are fat, then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship, no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement. \n 31:21 [hgb] 那 时 ， 有 许 多 祸 患 灾 难 临 到 他 们 ， 这 歌 必 在 他 们 面 前 作 见 证 ， 他 们 后 裔 的 口 中 必 念 诵 不 忘 。 我 未 领 他 们 到 我 所 起 誓 应 许 之 地 以 先 ， 他 们 所 怀 的 意 念 我 都 知 道 了 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. \n [bbe] Then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them, this song will be a witness to them, for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children: for I see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now, before I have taken them into the land of my oath. \n 31:22 [hgb] 当 日 摩 西 就 写 了 一 篇 歌 ， 教 导 以 色 列 人 。 \n [kjv] Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. \n [bbe] So that same day Moses made this song, teaching it to the children of Israel. \n 31:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 嘱 咐 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 说 ， 你 当 刚 强 壮 胆 ， 因 为 你 必 领 以 色 列 人 进 我 所 起 誓 应 许 他 们 的 地 。 我 必 与 你 同 在 。 \n [kjv] And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee. \n [bbe] Then he gave orders to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying to him, Be strong and take heart: for you are to go at the head of the children of Israel into the land which I made an oath to give them; and I will be with you. \n 31:24 [hgb] 摩 西 将 这 律 法 的 话 写 在 书 上 ， 及 至 写 完 了 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, \n [bbe] Now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete, \n 31:25 [hgb] 就 吩 咐 抬 耶 和 华 约 柜 的 利 未 人 说 ， \n [kjv] That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, \n [bbe] Moses said to the Levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement, \n 31:26 [hgb] 将 这 律 法 书 放 在 耶 和 华 你 们 神 的 约 柜 旁 ， 可 以 在 那 里 见 证 以 色 列 人 的 不 是 。 \n [kjv] Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. \n [bbe] Take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement, so that it may be a witness against you. \n 31:27 [hgb] 因 为 我 知 道 你 们 是 悖 逆 的 ， 是 硬 着 颈 项 的 。 我 今 日 还 活 着 与 你 们 同 在 ， 你 们 尚 且 悖 逆 耶 和 华 ， 何 况 我 死 后 呢 ？ \n [kjv] For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? \n [bbe] For I have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts: even now, while I am still living, you will not be ruled by the Lord; how much less after my death? \n 31:28 [hgb] 你 们 要 将 你 们 支 派 的 众 长 老 和 官 长 都 招 聚 了 来 ， 我 好 将 这 些 话 说 与 他 们 听 ， 并 呼 天 唤 地 见 证 他 们 的 不 是 。 \n [kjv] Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them. \n [bbe] Get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes, and your overseers, so that I may say these things in their hearing, and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them. \n 31:29 [hgb] 我 知 道 我 死 后 ， 你 们 必 全 然 败 坏 ， 偏 离 我 所 吩 咐 你 们 的 道 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 以 手 所 作 的 惹 他 发 怒 。 日 后 必 有 祸 患 临 到 你 们 。 \n [kjv] For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. \n [bbe] For I am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin, wandering from the way which I have given you; and evil will overtake you in the end, because you will do evil in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath by the work of your hands. \n 31:30 [hgb] 摩 西 将 这 一 篇 歌 的 话 都 说 与 以 色 列 全 会 众 听 。 \n [kjv] And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended. \n [bbe] Then in the hearing of all the meeting of Israel, Moses said the words of this song, to the end. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/538.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
