{"id":7263,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 摩 西 将 以 色 列 众 人 召 了 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 以 色 列 人 哪 ， 我 今 日 晓 谕 你 们 的 律 例 典 章 ， 你 们 要 听 ， 可 以 学 习 ， 谨 守 遵 行 。 [kjv] And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. [bbe] And Moses sent for all Israel, and said to them, Give ear, O Israel, to the laws and the decisions which I give you today, and give attention to them so that you may keep and do them. 5:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 在 何 烈 山 与 我 们 立 约 。 [kjv] The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. [bbe] The Lord our God made an agreement with us in Horeb. 5:3 [hgb] 这 约 不 是 与 我 们 列 祖 立 的 ， 乃 是 与 我 们 今 日 在 这 里 存 活 之 人 立 的 。 [kjv] The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. [bbe] The Lord did not make this agreement with our fathers but with us, who are all living and present here today. 5:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 在 山 上 ， 从 火 中 ， 面 对 面 与 你 们 说 话 。 [kjv] The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, [bbe] The word of the Lord came to you face to face on the mountain, out of the heart of the fire, 5:5 [hgb] （ 那 时 我 站 在 耶 和 华 和 你 们 中 间 ， 要 将 耶 和 华 的 话 传 给 你 们 ， 因 为 你 们 惧 怕 那 火 ， 没 有 上 山 ） [kjv] (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, [bbe] (I was between the Lord and you at that time, to make clear to you the word of the Lord: because, through fear of the fire, you did not go up the mountain;) saying, 5:6 [hgb] 说 ， 我 是 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 曾 将 你 从 埃 及 地 为 奴 之 家 领 出 来 。 [kjv] I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. [bbe] I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house. 5:7 [hgb] 除 了 我 以 外 ， 你 不 可 有 别 的 神 。 [kjv] Thou shalt have none other gods before me. [bbe] You are to have no other gods but me. 5:8 [hgb] 不 可 为 自 己 雕 刻 偶 像 ， 也 不 可 作 什 么 形 像 ， 仿 佛 上 天 ， 下 地 和 地 底 下 ， 水 中 的 百 物 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth: [bbe] You may not make for yourselves an image in the form of anything in heaven or on earth or in the waters under the earth: 5:9 [hgb] 不 可 跪 拜 那 些 像 ， 也 不 可 事 奉 它 ， 因 为 我 耶 和 华 你 的 神 是 忌 邪 的 神 。 恨 我 的 ， 我 必 追 讨 他 的 罪 ， 自 父 及 子 ， 直 到 三 ， 四 代 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, [bbe] You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation of my haters; 5:10 [hgb] 爱 我 ， 守 我 诫 命 的 ， 我 必 向 他 们 发 慈 爱 ， 直 到 千 代 。 [kjv] And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. [bbe] And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws. 5:11 [hgb] 不 可 妄 称 耶 和 华 你 神 的 名 。 因 为 妄 称 耶 和 华 名 的 ， 耶 和 华 必 不 以 他 为 无 罪 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. [bbe] You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord\u0027s name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged as a sinner by the Lord. 5:12 [hgb] 当 照 耶 和 华 你 神 所 吩 咐 的 守 安 息 日 为 圣 日 。 [kjv] Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee. [bbe] Keep the Sabbath day as a holy day, as you have been ordered by the Lord your God. 5:13 [hgb] 六 日 要 劳 碌 作 你 一 切 的 工 ， [kjv] Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: [bbe] On six days do all your work: 5:14 [hgb] 但 第 七 日 是 向 耶 和 华 你 神 当 守 的 安 息 日 。 这 一 日 ， 你 和 你 的 儿 女 ， 仆 婢 ， 牛 ， 驴 ， 牲 畜 ， 并 在 你 城 里 寄 居 的 客 旅 ， 无 论 何 工 都 不 可 作 ， 使 你 的 仆 婢 可 以 和 你 一 样 安 息 。 [kjv] But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. [bbe] But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day do no work, you or your son or your daughter, or your man-servant or your woman-servant, or your ox or your ass or any of your cattle, or the man from a strange country who is living among you; so that your man-servant and your woman-servant may have rest as well as you. 5:15 [hgb] 你 也 要 记 念 你 在 埃 及 地 作 过 奴 仆 。 耶 和 华 你 神 用 大 能 的 手 和 伸 出 来 的 膀 臂 将 你 从 那 里 领 出 来 。 因 此 ， 耶 和 华 你 的 神 吩 咐 你 守 安 息 日 。 [kjv] And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. [bbe] And keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord your God took you out of that land by his strong hand and his stretched-out arm: for this reason the Lord has given you orders to keep the Sabbath day. 5:16 [hgb] 当 照 耶 和 华 你 神 所 吩 咐 的 孝 敬 父 母 ， 使 你 得 福 ， 并 使 你 的 日 子 在 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 的 地 上 得 以 长 久 。 [kjv] Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. [bbe] Give honour to your father and your mother, as you have been ordered by the Lord your God; so that your life may be long and all may be well for you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. 5:17 [hgb] 不 可 杀 人 。 [kjv] Thou shalt not kill. [bbe] Do not put anyone to death without cause. 5:18 [hgb] 不 可 奸 淫 。 [kjv] Neither shalt thou commit adultery. [bbe] Do not be false to the married relation. 5:19 [hgb] 不 可 偷 盗 。 [kjv] Neither shalt thou steal. [bbe] Do not take the property of another. 5:20 [hgb] 不 可 作 假 见 证 陷 害 人 。 [kjv] Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. [bbe] Do not give false witness against your neighbour; 5:21 [hgb] 不 可 贪 恋 人 的 妻 子 。 也 不 可 贪 图 人 的 房 屋 ， 田 地 ， 仆 婢 ， 牛 ， 驴 ， 并 他 一 切 所 有 的 。 [kjv] Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour\u0027s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour\u0027s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour\u0027s. [bbe] Or let your desire be turned to your neighbour\u0027s wife, or his house or his field or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is your neighbour\u0027s. 5:22 [hgb] 这 些 话 是 耶 和 华 在 山 上 ， 从 火 中 ， 云 中 ， 幽 暗 中 ， 大 声 晓 谕 你 们 全 会 众 的 。 此 外 并 没 有 添 别 的 话 。 他 就 把 这 话 写 在 两 块 石 版 上 ， 交 给 我 了 。 [kjv] These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. [bbe] These words the Lord said to all of you together on the mountain, out of the heart of the fire, out of the cloud and the dark, with a great voice: and he said no more; he put them in writing on the two stones of the law and gave them to me. 5:23 [hgb] 那 时 ， 火 焰 烧 山 ， 你 们 听 见 从 黑 暗 中 出 来 的 声 音 。 你 们 支 派 中 所 有 的 首 领 和 长 老 都 来 就 近 我 ， [kjv] And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; [bbe] And after hearing the voice which came out of the dark while the mountain was burning with fire, all the heads of your tribes and your chiefs came to me, 5:24 [hgb] 说 ， 看 哪 ， 耶 和 华 我 们 神 将 他 的 荣 光 和 他 的 大 能 显 给 我 们 看 ， 我 们 又 听 见 他 的 声 音 从 火 中 出 来 。 今 日 我 们 得 见 神 与 人 说 话 ， 人 还 存 活 。 [kjv] And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. [bbe] And said, The Lord has let us see his glory and his power, and his voice has come to us out of the fire: today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of God. 5:25 [hgb] 现 在 这 大 火 将 要 烧 灭 我 们 ， 我 们 何 必 冒 死 呢 ？ 若 再 听 见 耶 和 华 我 们 神 的 声 音 就 必 死 亡 。 [kjv] Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. [bbe] Why then is death to be our fate? For if the voice of the Lord our God comes to us any more, death will overtake us, and we will be burned up in this great fire. 5:26 [hgb] 凡 属 血 气 的 ， 曾 有 何 人 听 见 永 生 神 的 声 音 从 火 中 出 来 ， 像 我 们 听 见 还 能 存 活 呢 ？ [kjv] For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? [bbe] For what man is there in all the earth, who, hearing the voice of the living God as we have, out of the heart of the fire, has been kept from death? 5:27 [hgb] 求 你 近 前 去 ， 听 耶 和 华 我 们 神 所 要 说 的 一 切 话 ， 将 他 对 你 说 的 话 都 传 给 我 们 ， 我 们 就 听 从 遵 行 。 [kjv] Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it. [bbe] Do you go near: and after hearing everything which the Lord our God has to say, give us an account of all he has said to you, and we will give ear, and do it. 5:28 [hgb] 你 们 对 我 说 的 话 ， 耶 和 华 都 听 见 了 。 耶 和 华 对 我 说 ， 这 百 姓 的 话 ， 我 听 见 了 。 他 们 所 说 的 都 是 。 [kjv] And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. [bbe] Then the Lord, hearing your words to me, said to me, The words which this people have said to you have come to my ears: what they have said is well said. 5:29 [hgb] 惟 愿 他 们 存 这 样 的 心 敬 畏 我 ， 常 遵 守 我 的 一 切 诫 命 ， 使 他 们 和 他 们 的 子 孙 永 远 得 福 。 [kjv] O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! [bbe] If only they had such a heart in them at all times, so that they might go in fear of me and keep my orders and that it might be well for them and for their children for ever! 5:30 [hgb] 你 去 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 回 帐 棚 去 吧 。 [kjv] Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. [bbe] Now say to them, Go back to your tents. 5:31 [hgb] 至 于 你 ， 可 以 站 在 我 这 里 ， 我 要 将 一 切 诫 命 ， 律 例 ， 典 章 传 给 你 。 你 要 教 训 他 们 ， 使 他 们 在 我 赐 他 们 为 业 的 地 上 遵 行 。 [kjv] But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. [bbe] But as for you, keep your place here by me, and I will give you all the orders and the laws and the decisions which you are to make clear to them, so that they may do them in the land which I am giving them for their heritage. 5:32 [hgb] 所 以 ， 你 们 要 照 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 吩 咐 的 谨 守 遵 行 ， 不 可 偏 离 左 右 。 [kjv] Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. [bbe] Take care, then, to do whatever the Lord your God has given you orders to do; let there be no turning away to the right hand or to the left. 5:33 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 吩 咐 你 们 行 的 ， 你 们 都 要 去 行 ， 使 你 们 可 以 存 活 得 福 ， 并 使 你 们 的 日 子 在 所 要 承 受 的 地 上 得 以 长 久 。 [kjv] Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. [bbe] Go on walking in the way ordered for you by the Lord your God, so that life may be yours and it may be well for you, and your days may be long in the land of your heritage.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/512.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
