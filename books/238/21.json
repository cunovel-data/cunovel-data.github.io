[bbe] Will say, This death is not the work of our hands and our eyes have not seen it. 21:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 赦 免 你 所 救 赎 的 以 色 列 民 ， 不 要 使 流 无 辜 血 的 罪 归 在 你 的 百 姓 以 色 列 中 间 。 这 样 ， 流 血 的 罪 必 得 赦 免 。 [kjv] Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel\u0027s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. [bbe] Have mercy, O Lord, on your people Israel whom you have made free, and take away from your people the crime of a death without cause. Then they will no longer be responsible for the man\u0027s death. 21:9 [hgb] 你 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 就 可 以 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 流 无 辜 血 的 罪 。 [kjv] So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. [bbe] So you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you, when you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord. 21:10 [hgb] 你 出 去 与 仇 敌 争 战 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 你 的 神 将 他 们 交 在 你 手 中 ， 你 就 掳 了 他 们 去 ， [kjv] When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, [bbe] When you go out to war against other nations, and the Lord your God gives them up into your hands and you take them as prisoners; 21:11 [hgb] 若 在 被 掳 的 人 中 见 有 美 貌 的 女 子 ， 恋 慕 她 ， 要 娶 她 为 妻 ， [kjv] And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; [bbe] If among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman and it is your desire to make her your wife; 21:12 [hgb] 就 可 以 领 她 到 你 家 里 去 。 她 便 要 剃 头 发 ， 修 指 甲 ， [kjv] Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; [bbe] Then take her back to your house; and let her hair and her nails be cut; 21:13 [hgb] 脱 去 被 掳 时 所 穿 的 衣 服 ， 住 在 你 家 里 哀 哭 父 母 一 个 整 月 ， 然 后 可 以 与 她 同 房 。 你 作 她 的 丈 夫 ， 她 作 你 的 妻 子 。 [kjv] And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. [bbe] And let her take off the dress in which she was made prisoner and go on living in your house and weeping for her father and mother for a full month: and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she will be your wife. 21:14 [hgb] 后 来 你 若 不 喜 悦 她 ， 就 要 由 她 随 意 出 去 ， 决 不 可 为 钱 卖 她 ， 也 不 可 当 婢 女 待 她 ， 因 为 你 玷 污 了 她 。 [kjv] And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her. [bbe] But if you have no delight in her, you are to let her go wherever she will; you may not take a price for her as if she was your property, for you have made use of her for your pleasure. 21:15 [hgb] 人 若 有 二 妻 ， 一 为 所 爱 ， 一 为 所 恶 ， 所 爱 的 ， 所 恶 的 都 给 他 生 了 儿 子 ， 但 长 子 是 所 恶 之 妻 生 的 。 [kjv] If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated: [bbe] If a man has two wives, one greatly loved and the other hated, and the two of them have had children by him; and if the first son is the child of the hated wife: 21:16 [hgb] 到 了 把 产 业 分 给 儿 子 承 受 的 时 候 ， 不 可 将 所 爱 之 妻 生 的 儿 子 立 为 长 子 ， 在 所 恶 之 妻 生 的 儿 子 以 上 ， [kjv] Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn: [bbe] Then when he gives his property to his sons for their heritage, he is not to put the son of his loved one in the place of the first son, the son of the hated wife: 21:17 [hgb] 却 要 认 所 恶 之 妻 生 的 儿 子 为 长 子 ， 将 产 业 多 加 一 分 给 他 。 因 这 儿 子 是 他 力 量 强 壮 的 时 候 生 的 ， 长 子 的 名 分 本 当 归 他 。 [kjv] But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his. [bbe] But he is to give his first son his birthright, and twice as great a part of his property: for he is the first-fruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his. 21:18 [hgb] 人 若 有 顽 梗 悖 逆 的 儿 子 ， 不 听 从 父 母 的 话 ， 他 们 虽 惩 治 他 ， 他 仍 不 听 从 ， [kjv] If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: [bbe] If a man has a son who is hard-hearted and uncontrolled, who gives no attention to the voice of his father and mother, and will not be ruled by them, though they give him punishment: 21:19 [hgb] 父 母 就 要 抓 住 他 ， 将 他 带 到 本 地 的 城 门 ， 本 城 的 长 老 那 里 ， [kjv] Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; [bbe] Then let his father and mother take him to the responsible men of the town, to the public place; 21:20 [hgb] 对 长 老 说 ， 我 们 这 儿 子 顽 梗 悖 逆 ， 不 听 从 我 们 的 话 ， 是 贪 食 好 酒 的 人 。 [kjv] And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. [bbe] And say to them, This son of ours is hard-hearted and uncontrolled, he will not give attention to us; he gives himself up to pleasure and strong drink. 21:21 [hgb] 本 城 的 众 人 就 要 用 石 头 将 他 打 死 。 这 样 ， 就 把 那 恶 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 ， 以 色 列 众 人 都 要 听 见 害 怕 。 [kjv] And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. [bbe] Then he is to be stoned to death by all the men of the town: so you are to put away the evil from among you; and all Israel, hearing of it, will be full of fear. 21:22 [hgb] 人 若 犯 该 死 的 罪 ， 被 治 死 了 ， 你 将 他 挂 在 木 头 上 ， [kjv] And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: [bbe] If a man does a crime for which the punishment is death, and he is put to death by hanging him on a tree; 21:23 [hgb] 他 的 尸 首 不 可 留 在 木 头 上 过 夜 ， 必 要 当 日 将 他 葬 埋 ， 免 得 玷 污 了 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 你 为 业 之 地 。 因 为 被 挂 的 人 是 在 神 面 前 受 咒 诅 的 。 [kjv] His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. [bbe] Do not let his body be on the tree all night, but put it to rest in the earth the same day; for the man who undergoes hanging is cursed by God; so do not make unclean the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/528.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
