And turning, we went by the road through the waste land of Moab. \n 2:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 吩 咐 我 说 ， 不 可 扰 害 摩 押 人 ， 也 不 可 与 他 们 争 战 。 他 们 的 地 ， 我 不 赐 给 你 为 业 ， 因 我 已 将 亚 珥 赐 给 罗 得 的 子 孙 为 业 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to me, Make no attack on Moab and do not go to war with them, for I will not give you any of his land: because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for their heritage. \n 2:10 [hgb] （ 先 前 ， 有 以 米 人 住 在 那 里 ， 民 数 众 多 ， 身 体 高 大 ， 像 亚 衲 人 一 样 。 \n [kjv] The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; \n [bbe] (In the past the Emim were living there; a great people, equal in numbers to the Anakim and as tall; \n 2:11 [hgb] 这 以 米 人 像 亚 衲 人 。 也 算 为 利 乏 音 人 。 摩 押 人 称 他 们 为 以 米 人 。 \n [kjv] Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims. \n [bbe] They are numbered among the Rephaim, like the Anakim; but are named Emim by the Moabites. \n 2:12 [hgb] 先 前 ， 何 利 人 也 住 在 西 珥 ， 但 以 扫 的 子 孙 将 他 们 除 灭 ， 得 了 他 们 的 地 ， 接 着 居 住 ， 就 如 以 色 列 在 耶 和 华 赐 给 他 为 业 之 地 所 行 的 一 样 。 ） \n [kjv] The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them. \n [bbe] And the Horites in earlier times were living in Seir, but the children of Esau took their place; they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves, as Israel did to the land of his heritage which the Lord gave them.) \n 2:13 [hgb] 现 在 ， 起 来 过 撒 烈 溪 。 于 是 我 们 过 了 撒 烈 溪 。 \n [kjv] Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. \n [bbe] Get up now, and go over the stream Zered. So we went over the stream Zered. \n 2:14 [hgb] 自 从 离 开 加 低 斯 巴 尼 亚 ， 到 过 了 撒 烈 溪 的 时 候 ， 共 有 三 十 八 年 ， 等 那 世 代 的 兵 丁 都 从 营 中 灭 尽 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 向 他 们 所 起 的 誓 。 \n [kjv] And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. \n [bbe] Thirty-eight years had gone by from the time when we came away from Kadesh-barnea till we went over the stream Zered; by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead, as the Lord had said. \n 2:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 手 也 攻 击 他 们 ， 将 他 们 从 营 中 除 灭 ， 直 到 灭 尽 。 \n [kjv] For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. \n [bbe] For the hand of the Lord was against them, working their destruction, till all were dead. \n 2:16 [hgb] 兵 丁 从 民 中 都 灭 尽 死 亡 以 后 ， \n [kjv] So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, \n [bbe] So when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people, \n 2:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 吩 咐 我 说 ， \n [kjv] That the LORD spake unto me, saying, \n [bbe] The word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n 2:18 [hgb] 你 今 天 要 从 摩 押 的 境 界 亚 珥 经 过 ， \n [kjv] Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: \n [bbe] You are about to go by Ar, the limit of the country of Moab; \n 2:19 [hgb] 走 近 亚 扪 人 之 地 ， 不 可 扰 害 他 们 ， 也 不 可 与 他 们 争 战 。 亚 扪 人 的 地 ， 我 不 赐 给 你 们 为 业 ， 因 我 已 将 那 地 赐 给 罗 得 的 子 孙 为 业 。 \n [kjv] And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. \n [bbe] And when you come near the land of the children of Ammon, give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them, for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for your heritage: because I have given it to the children of Lot. \n 2:20 [hgb] （ 那 地 也 算 为 利 乏 音 人 之 地 ， 先 前 利 乏 音 人 住 在 那 里 ， 亚 扪 人 称 他 们 为 散 送 冥 。 \n [kjv] (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; \n [bbe] (That land is said to have been a land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim had been living there in earlier times, but they were named Zamzummim by the Ammonites; \n 2:21 [hgb] 那 民 众 多 ， 身 体 高 大 ， 像 亚 衲 人 一 样 ， 但 耶 和 华 从 亚 扪 人 面 前 除 灭 他 们 ， 亚 扪 人 就 得 了 他 们 的 地 ， 接 着 居 住 。 \n [kjv] A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: \n [bbe] They were a great people, tall as the Anakim, and equal to them in number; but the Lord sent destruction on them and the children of Ammon took their place, living in their land; \n 2:22 [hgb] 正 如 耶 和 华 从 前 为 住 西 珥 的 以 扫 子 孙 将 何 利 人 从 他 们 面 前 除 灭 ， 他 们 得 了 何 利 人 的 地 ， 接 着 居 住 一 样 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \n [kjv] As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: \n [bbe] As he did for the children of Esau living in Seir, when he sent destruction on the Horites before them, and they took their land where they are living to this day: \n 2:23 [hgb] 从 迦 斐 托 出 来 的 迦 斐 托 人 将 先 前 住 在 乡 村 直 到 迦 萨 的 亚 卫 人 除 灭 ， 接 着 居 住 。 ） \n [kjv] And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) \n [bbe] And the Avvim, living in the small towns as far as Gaza, came to destruction by the hands of the Caphtorim who came out from Caphtor and took their land.) \n 2:24 [hgb] 你 们 起 来 前 往 ， 过 亚 嫩 谷 。 我 已 将 亚 摩 利 人 希 实 本 王 西 宏 和 他 的 地 交 在 你 手 中 ， 你 要 与 他 争 战 ， 得 他 的 地 为 业 。 \n [kjv] Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. \n [bbe] Get up now, and go on your journey, crossing over the valley of the Arnon: see, I have given into your hands Sihon, the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and all his land: go forward to make it yours, and make war on him, \n 2:25 [hgb] 从 今 日 起 ， 我 要 使 天 下 万 民 听 见 你 的 名 声 都 惊 恐 惧 怕 ， 且 因 你 发 颤 伤 恸 。 \n [kjv] This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. \n [bbe] From now on I will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven, who, hearing of you, will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you. \n 2:26 [hgb] 我 从 基 底 莫 的 旷 野 差 遣 使 者 去 见 希 实 本 王 西 宏 ， 用 和 睦 的 话 说 ， \n [kjv] And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, \n [bbe] Then from the waste land of Kedemoth I sent representatives to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, \n 2:27 [hgb] 求 你 容 我 从 你 的 地 经 过 ， 只 走 大 道 ， 不 偏 左 右 。 \n [kjv] Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. \n [bbe] Let me go through your land: I will keep to the highway, not turning to the right or to the left; \n 2:28 [hgb] 你 可 以 卖 粮 给 我 吃 ， 也 可 以 卖 水 给 我 喝 ， 只 要 容 我 步 行 过 去 ， \n [kjv] Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; \n [bbe] Let me have food, at a price, for my needs, and water for drinking: only let me go through on foot; \n 2:29 [hgb] 就 如 住 西 珥 的 以 扫 子 孙 和 住 亚 珥 的 摩 押 人 待 我 一 样 ， 等 我 过 了 约 旦 河 ， 好 进 入 耶 和 华 我 们 神 所 赐 给 我 们 的 地 。 \n [kjv] (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. \n [bbe] As the children of Esau did for me in Seir and the Moabites in Ar; till I have gone over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us. \n 2:30 [hgb] 但 希 实 本 王 西 宏 不 容 我 们 从 他 那 里 经 过 。 因 为 耶 和 华 你 的 神 使 他 心 中 刚 硬 ， 性 情 顽 梗 ， 为 要 将 他 交 在 你 手 中 ， 像 今 日 一 样 。 \n [kjv] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. \n [bbe] But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us go through; for the Lord your God made his spirit hard and his heart strong, so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day. \n 2:31 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 我 说 ， 从 此 起 首 ， 我 要 将 西 宏 和 他 的 地 交 给 你 。 你 要 得 他 的 地 为 业 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to me, See, from now on I have given Sihon and his land into your hands: go forward now to take his land and make it yours. \n 2:32 [hgb] 那 时 ， 西 宏 和 他 的 众 民 出 来 攻 击 我 们 ， 在 雅 杂 与 我 们 交 战 。 \n [kjv] Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. \n [bbe] Then Sihon came out against us with all his people, to make an attack on us at Jahaz. \n 2:33 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 将 他 交 给 我 们 ， 我 们 就 把 他 和 他 的 儿 子 ， 并 他 的 众 民 ， 都 击 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. \n [bbe] And the Lord our God gave him into our hands; and we overcame him and his sons and all his people. \n 2:34 [hgb] 我 们 夺 了 他 的 一 切 城 邑 ， 将 有 人 烟 的 各 城 ， 连 女 人 带 孩 子 ， 尽 都 毁 灭 ， 没 有 留 下 一 个 。 \n [kjv] And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: \n [bbe] At that time we took all his towns, and gave them over to complete destruction, together with men, women, and children; we had no mercy on any: \n 2:35 [hgb] 惟 有 牲 畜 和 所 夺 的 各 城 ， 并 其 中 的 财 物 ， 都 取 为 自 己 的 掠 物 。 \n [kjv] Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. \n [bbe] Only the cattle we took for ourselves, with the goods from the towns we had taken. \n 2:36 [hgb] 从 亚 嫩 谷 边 的 亚 罗 珥 和 谷 中 的 城 ， 直 到 基 列 ， 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 都 交 给 我 们 了 ， 没 有 一 座 城 高 得 使 我 们 不 能 攻 取 的 。 \n [kjv] From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: \n [bbe] From Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon and from the town in the valley as far as Gilead, no town was strong enough to keep us out; the Lord our God gave them all into our hands: \n 2:37 [hgb] 惟 有 亚 扪 人 之 地 ， 凡 靠 近 雅 博 河 的 地 ， 并 山 地 的 城 邑 ， 与 耶 和 华 我 们 神 所 禁 止 我 们 去 的 地 方 ， 都 没 有 挨 近 。 \n [kjv] Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. \n [bbe] But you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon, that is, all the side of the river Jabbok or the towns of the hill-country, wherever the Lord our God had said we were not to go. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/340.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
