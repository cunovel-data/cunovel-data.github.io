let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. \\n\\n [bbe] And let the overseers say to the people, If there is any man who has made for himself a new house and has not gone into it, let him go back to his house, so that in the event of his death in the fight, another may not take his house for himself. \\n\\n 20:6 [hgb] 谁 种 葡 萄 园 ， 尚 未 用 所 结 的 果 子 ， 他 可 以 回 家 去 ， 恐 怕 他 阵 亡 ， 别 人 去 用 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. \\n\\n [bbe] Or if any man has made a vine-garden without taking the first-fruits of it, let him go back to his house, so that in the event of his death in the fight, another may not be the first to make use of the fruit. \\n\\n 20:7 [hgb] 谁 聘 定 了 妻 ， 尚 未 迎 娶 ， 他 可 以 回 家 去 ， 恐 怕 他 阵 亡 ， 别 人 去 娶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. \\n\\n [bbe] Or if any man is newly married and has had no sex relations with his wife, let him go back to his house, so that in the event of his death in the fight, another man may not take her. \\n\\n 20:8 [hgb] 官 长 又 要 对 百 姓 宣 告 说 ， 谁 惧 怕 胆 怯 ， 他 可 以 回 家 去 ， 恐 怕 他 弟 兄 的 心 消 化 ， 和 他 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren\u0027s heart faint as well as his heart. \\n\\n [bbe] And let the overseers go on to say to the people, If there is any man whose heart is feeble with fear, let him go back to his house before he makes the hearts of his countrymen feeble. \\n\\n 20:9 [hgb] 官 长 对 百 姓 宣 告 完 了 ， 就 当 派 军 长 率 领 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people. \\n\\n [bbe] Then, after saying these words to the people, let the overseers put captains over the army. \\n\\n 20:10 [hgb] 你 临 近 一 座 城 ， 要 攻 打 的 时 候 ， 先 要 对 城 里 的 民 宣 告 和 睦 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. \\n\\n [bbe] When you come to a town, before attacking it, make an offer of peace. \\n\\n 20:11 [hgb] 他 们 若 以 和 睦 的 话 回 答 你 ， 给 你 开 了 城 ， 城 里 所 有 的 人 都 要 给 你 效 劳 ， 服 事 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And if it gives you back an answer of peace, opening its doors to you, then all the people in it may be put to forced work as your servants. \\n\\n 20:12 [hgb] 若 不 肯 与 你 和 好 ， 反 要 与 你 打 仗 ， 你 就 要 围 困 那 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: \\n\\n [bbe] If however it will not make peace with you, but war, then let it be shut in on all sides: \\n\\n 20:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 的 神 把 城 交 付 你 手 ， 你 就 要 用 刀 杀 尽 这 城 的 男 丁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: \\n\\n [bbe] And when the Lord your God has given it into your hands, let every male in it be put to death without mercy. \\n\\n 20:14 [hgb] 惟 有 妇 女 ， 孩 子 ， 牲 畜 ， 和 城 内 一 切 的 财 物 ， 你 可 以 取 为 自 己 的 掠 物 。 耶 和 华 你 神 把 你 仇 敌 的 财 物 赐 给 你 ， 你 可 以 吃 用 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. \\n\\n [bbe] But the women and the children and the cattle and everything in the town and all its wealth, you may take for yourselves: the wealth of your haters, which the Lord your God has given you, will be your food. \\n\\n 20:15 [hgb] 离 你 甚 远 的 各 城 ， 不 是 这 些 国 民 的 城 ， 你 都 要 这 样 待 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations. \\n\\n [bbe] So you are to do to all the towns far away, which are not the towns of these nations. \\n\\n 20:16 [hgb] 但 这 些 国 民 的 城 ， 耶 和 华 你 神 既 赐 你 为 业 ， 其 中 凡 有 气 息 的 ， 一 个 不 可 存 留 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: \\n\\n [bbe] But in the towns of these peoples whose land the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, let no living thing be kept from death: \\n\\n 20:17 [hgb] 只 要 照 耶 和 华 你 神 所 吩 咐 的 将 这 赫 人 ， 亚 摩 利 人 ， 迦 南 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 都 灭 绝 净 尽 ， \\n\\n [kjv] But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee: \\n\\n [bbe] Give them up to the curse; the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has given you orders: \\n\\n 20:18 [hgb] 免 得 他 们 教 导 你 们 学 习 一 切 可 憎 恶 的 事 ， 就 是 他 们 向 自 己 神 所 行 的 ， 以 致 你 们 得 罪 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God. \\n\\n [bbe] So that you may not take them as your example and do all the disgusting things which they do in the worship of their gods, so sinning against the Lord your God. \\n\\n 20:19 [hgb] 你 若 许 久 围 困 ， 攻 打 所 要 取 的 一 座 城 ， 就 不 可 举 斧 子 砍 坏 树 木 。 因 为 你 可 以 吃 那 树 上 的 果 子 ， 不 可 砍 伐 。 田 间 的 树 木 岂 是 人 ， 叫 你 糟 蹋 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man\u0027s life) to employ them in the siege: \\n\\n [bbe] If in war a town is shut in by your armies for a long time, do not let its trees be cut down and made waste; for their fruit will be your food; are the trees of the countryside men for you to take up arms against them? \\n\\n 20:20 [hgb] 惟 独 你 所 知 道 不 是 结 果 子 的 树 木 可 以 毁 坏 ， 砍 伐 ， 用 以 修 筑 营 垒 ， 攻 击 那 与 你 打 仗 的 城 ， 直 到 攻 塌 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued. \\n\\n [bbe] Only those trees which you are certain are not used for food may be cut down and put to destruction: and you are to make walls of attack against the town till it is taken. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/527.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
