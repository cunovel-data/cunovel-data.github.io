{"id":7266,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 我 今 日 所 吩 咐 的 一 切 诫 命 ， 你 们 要 谨 守 遵 行 ， 好 叫 你 们 存 活 ， 人 数 增 多 ， 且 进 去 得 耶 和 华 向 你 们 列 祖 起 誓 应 许 的 那 地 。 [kjv] All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. [bbe] Take care to keep all the orders which I give you today, so that you may have life and be increased and go in and take as a heritage the land which the Lord, by his oath to your fathers, undertook to give you. 8:2 [hgb] 你 也 要 记 念 耶 和 华 你 的 神 在 旷 野 引 导 你 这 四 十 年 ， 是 要 苦 炼 你 ， 试 验 你 ， 要 知 道 你 心 内 如 何 ， 肯 守 他 的 诫 命 不 肯 。 [kjv] And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. [bbe] And keep in mind the way by which the Lord your God has taken you through the waste land these forty years, so that he might make low your pride and put you to the test, to see what was in your heart and if you would keep his orders or not. 8:3 [hgb] 他 苦 炼 你 ， 任 你 饥 饿 ， 将 你 和 你 列 祖 所 不 认 识 的 吗 哪 赐 给 你 吃 ， 使 你 知 道 ， 人 活 着 不 是 单 靠 食 物 ， 乃 是 靠 耶 和 华 口 里 所 出 的 一 切 话 。 [kjv] And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. [bbe] And he made low your pride and let you be without food and gave you manna for your food, a thing new to you, which your fathers never saw; so that he might make it clear to you that bread is not man\u0027s only need, but his life is in every word which comes out of the mouth of the Lord. 8:4 [hgb] 这 四 十 年 ， 你 的 衣 服 没 有 穿 破 ， 你 的 脚 也 没 有 肿 。 [kjv] Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. [bbe] Through all these forty years your clothing did not get old or your feet become tired. 8:5 [hgb] 你 当 心 里 思 想 ， 耶 和 华 你 神 管 教 你 ， 好 像 人 管 教 儿 子 一 样 。 [kjv] Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. [bbe] Keep in mind this thought, that as a son is trained by his father, so you have been trained by the Lord your God. 8:6 [hgb] 你 要 谨 守 耶 和 华 你 神 的 诫 命 ， 遵 行 他 的 道 ， 敬 畏 他 。 [kjv] Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. [bbe] Then keep the orders of the Lord your God, fearing him and walking in his ways. 8:7 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 你 神 领 你 进 入 美 地 ， 那 地 有 河 ， 有 泉 ， 有 源 ， 从 山 谷 中 流 出 水 来 。 [kjv] For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; [bbe] For the Lord your God is guiding you into a good land, a land of water-springs, of fountains, and deep streams flowing out from the valleys and the hills; 8:8 [hgb] 那 地 有 小 麦 ， 大 麦 ， 葡 萄 树 ， 无 花 果 树 ， 石 榴 树 ， 橄 榄 树 ， 和 蜜 。 [kjv] A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; [bbe] A land of grain and vines and fig-trees and fair fruits; a land of oil-giving olive-trees and honey; 8:9 [hgb] 你 在 那 地 不 缺 食 物 ， 一 无 所 缺 。 那 地 的 石 头 是 铁 ， 山 内 可 以 挖 铜 。 [kjv] A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. [bbe] Where there will be bread for you in full measure and you will be in need of nothing; a land where the very stones are iron and from whose hills you may get copper. 8:10 [hgb] 你 吃 得 饱 足 ， 就 要 称 颂 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 因 他 将 那 美 地 赐 给 你 了 。 [kjv] When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. [bbe] And you will have food enough and be full, praising the Lord your God for the good land he has given you. 8:11 [hgb] 你 要 谨 慎 ， 免 得 忘 记 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 不 守 他 的 诫 命 ， 典 章 ， 律 例 ， 就 是 我 今 日 所 吩 咐 你 的 。 [kjv] Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: [bbe] Then take care that you are not turned away from the Lord your God and from keeping his orders and decisions and laws which I give you this day: 8:12 [hgb] 恐 怕 你 吃 得 饱 足 ， 建 造 美 好 的 房 屋 居 住 ， [kjv] Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; [bbe] And when you have taken food and are full, and have made fair houses for yourselves and are living in them; 8:13 [hgb] 你 的 牛 羊 加 多 ， 你 的 金 银 增 添 ， 并 你 所 有 的 全 都 加 增 ， [kjv] And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; [bbe] And when your herds and your flocks are increased, and your stores of silver and gold, and you have wealth of every sort; 8:14 [hgb] 你 就 心 高 气 傲 ， 忘 记 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 就 是 将 你 从 埃 及 地 为 奴 之 家 领 出 来 的 ， [kjv] Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; [bbe] Take care that your hearts are not lifted up in pride, giving no thought to the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house; 8:15 [hgb] 引 你 经 过 那 大 而 可 怕 的 旷 野 ， 那 里 有 火 蛇 ， 蝎 子 ， 干 旱 无 水 之 地 。 他 曾 为 你 使 水 从 坚 硬 的 磐 石 中 流 出 来 ， [kjv] Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; [bbe] Who was your guide through that great and cruel waste, where there were poison-snakes and scorpions and a dry land without water; who made water come out of the hard rock for you; 8:16 [hgb] 又 在 旷 野 将 你 列 祖 所 不 认 识 的 吗 哪 赐 给 你 吃 ， 是 要 苦 炼 你 ， 试 验 你 ， 叫 你 终 久 享 福 。 [kjv] Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; [bbe] Who gave you manna for your food in the waste land, a food which your fathers had never seen; so that your pride might be broken and your hearts tested for your good in the end; 8:17 [hgb] 恐 怕 你 心 里 说 ， 这 货 财 是 我 力 量 ， 我 能 力 得 来 的 。 [kjv] And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. [bbe] Say not then, in your hearts, My power and the strength of my hands have got me this wealth. 8:18 [hgb] 你 要 记 念 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 因 为 得 货 财 的 力 量 是 他 给 你 的 ， 为 要 坚 定 他 向 你 列 祖 起 誓 所 立 的 约 ， 像 今 日 一 样 。 [kjv] But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day. [bbe] But keep in mind the Lord your God: for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth, so that he may give effect to the agreement which he made by his oath with your fathers, as at this day. 8:19 [hgb] 你 若 忘 记 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 随 从 别 神 ， 事 奉 敬 拜 ， 你 们 必 定 灭 亡 。 这 是 我 今 日 警 戒 你 们 的 。 [kjv] And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. [bbe] And it is certain that if at any time you are turned away from the Lord your God, and go after other gods, to be their servants and to give them worship, destruction will overtake you. 8:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 在 你 们 面 前 怎 样 使 列 国 的 民 灭 亡 ， 你 们 也 必 照 样 灭 亡 ， 因 为 你 们 不 听 从 耶 和 华 你 们 神 的 话 。 [kjv] As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God. [bbe] Like the nations which the Lord is cutting off before you, so you will be cut off; because you would not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/515.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
