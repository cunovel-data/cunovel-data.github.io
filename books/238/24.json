or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; \n [bbe] And if the second husband has no love for her and, giving her a statement in writing, sends her away; or if death comes to the second husband to whom she was married; \n 24:4 [hgb] 打 发 她 去 的 前 夫 不 可 在 妇 人 玷 污 之 后 再 娶 她 为 妻 ， 因 为 这 是 耶 和 华 所 憎 恶 的 。 不 可 使 耶 和 华 你 神 所 赐 为 业 之 地 被 玷 污 了 。 \n [kjv] Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. \n [bbe] Her first husband, who had sent her away, may not take her back after she has been wife to another; for that is disgusting to the Lord: and you are not to be a cause of sin in the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage. \n 24:5 [hgb] 新 娶 妻 之 人 不 可 从 军 出 征 ， 也 不 可 托 他 办 理 什 么 公 事 ， 可 以 在 家 清 闲 一 年 ， 使 他 所 娶 的 妻 快 活 。 \n [kjv] When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken. \n [bbe] A newly married man will not have to go out with the army or undertake any business, but may be free for one year, living in his house for the comfort of his wife. \n 24:6 [hgb] 不 可 拿 人 的 全 盘 磨 石 或 是 上 磨 石 作 当 头 ， 因 为 这 是 拿 人 的 命 作 当 头 。 \n [kjv] No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man\u0027s life to pledge. \n [bbe] No one is to take, on account of a debt, the stones with which grain is crushed: for in doing so he takes a man\u0027s living. \n 24:7 [hgb] 若 遇 见 人 拐 带 以 色 列 中 的 一 个 弟 兄 ， 当 奴 才 待 他 ， 或 是 卖 了 他 ， 那 拐 带 人 的 就 必 治 死 。 这 样 ， 便 将 那 恶 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 。 \n [kjv] If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you. \n [bbe] If a man takes by force one of his countrymen, the children of Israel, using him as his property or getting a price for him, that thief is to be put to death: so you are to put away evil from among you. \n 24:8 [hgb] 在 大 麻 疯 的 灾 病 上 ， 你 们 要 谨 慎 ， 照 祭 司 利 未 人 一 切 所 指 教 你 们 的 留 意 遵 行 。 我 怎 样 吩 咐 他 们 ， 你 们 要 怎 样 遵 行 。 \n [kjv] Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. \n [bbe] In connection with the leper\u0027s disease, take care to keep and do every detail of the teaching of the priests, the Levites: as I gave them orders, so you are to do. \n 24:9 [hgb] 当 记 念 出 埃 及 后 ， 在 路 上 ， 耶 和 华 你 神 向 米 利 暗 所 行 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt. \n [bbe] Keep in mind what the Lord your God did to Miriam on the way, when you came out of Egypt. \n 24:10 [hgb] 你 借 给 邻 舍 ， 不 拘 是 什 么 ， 不 可 进 他 家 拿 他 的 当 头 。 \n [kjv] When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. \n [bbe] If you let your brother have the use of anything which is yours, do not go into his house and take anything of his as a sign of his debt; \n 24:11 [hgb] 要 站 在 外 面 ， 等 那 向 你 借 贷 的 人 把 当 头 拿 出 来 交 给 你 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. \n [bbe] But keep outside till he comes out and gives it to you. \n 24:12 [hgb] 他 若 是 穷 人 ， 你 不 可 留 他 的 当 头 过 夜 。 \n [kjv] And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge: \n [bbe] If he is a poor man, do not keep his property all night; \n 24:13 [hgb] 日 落 的 时 候 ， 总 要 把 当 头 还 他 ， 使 他 用 那 件 衣 服 盖 着 睡 觉 ， 他 就 为 你 祝 福 。 这 在 耶 和 华 你 神 面 前 就 是 你 的 义 了 。 \n [kjv] In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God. \n [bbe] But be certain to give it back to him when the sun goes down, so that he may have his clothing for sleeping in, and will give you his blessing: and this will be put to your account as righteousness before the Lord your God. \n 24:14 [hgb] 困 苦 穷 乏 的 雇 工 ， 无 论 是 你 的 弟 兄 或 是 在 你 城 里 寄 居 的 ， 你 不 可 欺 负 他 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates: \n [bbe] Do not be hard on a servant who is poor and in need, if he is one of your countrymen or a man from another nation living with you in your land. \n 24:15 [hgb] 要 当 日 给 他 工 价 ， 不 可 等 到 日 落 。 因 为 他 穷 苦 ， 把 心 放 在 工 价 上 ， 恐 怕 他 因 你 求 告 耶 和 华 ， 罪 便 归 你 了 。 \n [kjv] At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee. \n [bbe] Give him his payment day by day, not keeping it back over night; for he is poor and his living is dependent on it; and if his cry against you comes to the ears of the Lord, it will be judged as sin in you. \n 24:16 [hgb] 不 可 因 子 杀 父 ， 也 不 可 因 父 杀 子 。 凡 被 杀 的 都 为 本 身 的 罪 。 \n [kjv] The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. \n [bbe] Fathers are not to be put to death for their children or children for their fathers: every man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done. \n 24:17 [hgb] 你 不 可 向 寄 居 的 和 孤 儿 屈 枉 正 直 ， 也 不 可 拿 寡 妇 的 衣 裳 作 当 头 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow\u0027s raiment to pledge: \n [bbe] Be upright in judging the cause of the man from a strange country and of him who has no father; do not take a widow\u0027s clothing on account of a debt: \n 24:18 [hgb] 要 记 念 你 在 埃 及 作 过 奴 仆 。 耶 和 华 你 的 神 从 那 里 将 你 救 赎 ， 所 以 我 吩 咐 你 这 样 行 。 \n [kjv] But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. \n [bbe] But keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God made you free: for this is why I give you orders to do this. \n 24:19 [hgb] 你 在 田 间 收 割 庄 稼 ， 若 忘 下 一 捆 ， 不 可 回 去 再 取 ， 要 留 给 寄 居 的 与 孤 儿 寡 妇 。 这 样 ， 耶 和 华 你 神 必 在 你 手 里 所 办 的 一 切 事 上 赐 福 与 你 。 \n [kjv] When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. \n [bbe] When you get in the grain from your field, if some of the grain has been dropped by chance in the field, do not go back and get it, but let it be for the man from a strange land, the child without a father, and the widow: so that the blessing of the Lord your God may be on all the work of your hands. \n 24:20 [hgb] 你 打 橄 榄 树 ， 枝 上 剩 下 的 ， 不 可 再 打 。 要 留 给 寄 居 的 与 孤 儿 寡 妇 。 \n [kjv] When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. \n [bbe] When you are shaking the fruit from your olive-trees, do not go over the branches a second time: let some be for the man from a strange land, the child without a father, and the widow. \n 24:21 [hgb] 你 摘 葡 萄 园 的 葡 萄 ， 所 剩 下 的 ， 不 可 再 摘 。 要 留 给 寄 居 的 与 孤 儿 寡 妇 。 \n [kjv] When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. \n [bbe] When you are pulling the grapes from your vines, do not take up those which have been dropped; let them be for the man from a strange land, the child without a father, and the widow. \n 24:22 [hgb] 你 也 要 记 念 你 在 埃 及 地 作 过 奴 仆 ， 所 以 我 吩 咐 你 这 样 行 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing. \n [bbe] Keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt: for this is why I give you orders to do this. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/531.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
