{"id":7264,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 这 是 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 吩 咐 教 训 你 们 的 诫 命 ， 律 例 ， 典 章 ， 使 你 们 在 所 要 过 去 得 为 业 的 地 上 遵 行 ， \n [kjv] Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it: \n [bbe] Now these are the orders and the laws and the decisions which the Lord your God gave me for your teaching, so that you might do them in the land of your heritage to which you are going: \n 6:2 [hgb] 好 叫 你 和 你 子 子 孙 孙 一 生 敬 畏 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 谨 守 他 的 一 切 律 例 诫 命 ， 就 是 我 所 吩 咐 你 的 ， 使 你 的 日 子 得 以 长 久 。 \n [kjv] That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son\u0027s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. \n [bbe] So that living in the fear of the Lord your God, you may keep all his laws and his orders, which I give you: you and your son and your son\u0027s son, all the days of your life; and so that your life may be long. \n 6:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 阿 ， 你 要 听 ， 要 谨 守 遵 行 ， 使 你 可 以 在 那 流 奶 与 蜜 之 地 得 以 享 福 ， 人 数 极 其 增 多 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 你 列 祖 的 神 所 应 许 你 的 。 \n [kjv] Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. \n [bbe] So give ear, O Israel, and take care to do this; so that it may be well for you, and you may be greatly increased, as the Lord the God of your fathers has given you his word, in a land flowing with milk and honey. \n 6:4 [hgb] 以 色 列 阿 ， 你 要 听 。 耶 和 华 我 们 神 是 独 一 的 主 。 \n [kjv] Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: \n [bbe] Give ear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord: \n 6:5 [hgb] 你 要 尽 心 ， 尽 性 ， 尽 力 爱 耶 和 华 你 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. \n [bbe] And the Lord your God is to be loved with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. \n 6:6 [hgb] 我 今 日 所 吩 咐 你 的 话 都 要 记 在 心 上 ， \n [kjv] And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: \n [bbe] Keep these words, which I say to you this day, deep in your hearts; \n 6:7 [hgb] 也 要 殷 勤 教 训 你 的 儿 女 。 无 论 你 坐 在 家 里 ， 行 在 路 上 ， 躺 下 ， 起 来 ， 都 要 谈 论 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. \n [bbe] Teaching them to your children with all care, talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way, when you go to sleep and when you get up. \n 6:8 [hgb] 也 要 系 在 手 上 为 记 号 ， 戴 在 额 上 为 经 文 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. \n [bbe] Let them be fixed as a sign on your hand, and marked on your brow; \n 6:9 [hgb] 又 要 写 在 你 房 屋 的 门 框 上 ， 并 你 的 城 门 上 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. \n [bbe] Have them lettered on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns. \n 6:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 的 神 领 你 进 他 向 你 列 祖 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 起 誓 应 许 给 你 的 地 。 那 里 有 城 邑 ， 又 大 又 美 ， 非 你 所 建 造 的 。 \n [kjv] And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, \n [bbe] And when the Lord your God has taken you into the land which he gave his oath to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, that he would give you; with great and fair towns which were not of your building; \n 6:11 [hgb] 有 房 屋 ， 装 满 各 样 美 物 ， 非 你 所 装 满 的 。 有 凿 成 的 水 井 ， 非 你 所 凿 成 的 。 还 有 葡 萄 园 ， 橄 榄 园 ， 非 你 所 栽 种 的 。 你 吃 了 而 且 饱 足 。 \n [kjv] And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; \n [bbe] And houses full of good things not stored up by you, and places for storing water which you did not make, and vine-gardens and olive-trees not of your planting; and you have taken food and are full; \n 6:12 [hgb] 那 时 你 要 谨 慎 ， 免 得 你 忘 记 将 你 从 埃 及 地 ， 为 奴 之 家 领 出 来 的 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. \n [bbe] Then take care that you keep your hearts true to the Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house. \n 6:13 [hgb] 你 要 敬 畏 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 事 奉 他 ， 指 着 他 的 名 起 誓 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. \n [bbe] Let the fear of the Lord your God be in your hearts, and be his servants, taking your oaths by his name. \n 6:14 [hgb] 不 可 随 从 别 神 ， 就 是 你 们 四 围 国 民 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you; \n [bbe] Do not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples round about you; \n 6:15 [hgb] 因 为 在 你 们 中 间 的 耶 和 华 你 神 是 忌 邪 的 神 ， 惟 恐 耶 和 华 你 神 的 怒 气 向 你 发 作 ， 就 把 你 从 地 上 除 灭 。 \n [kjv] (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth. \n [bbe] For the Lord your God who is with you is a God who will not let his honour be given to another; or the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you, causing your destruction from the face of the earth. \n 6:16 [hgb] 你 们 不 可 试 探 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 象 你 们 在 玛 撒 那 样 试 探 他 。 \n [kjv] Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. \n [bbe] Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did in Massah. \n 6:17 [hgb] 要 留 意 遵 守 耶 和 华 你 们 神 所 吩 咐 的 诫 命 ， 法 度 ， 律 例 。 \n [kjv] Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. \n [bbe] Keep with care the orders of the Lord your God, and his rules and his laws which he has given you; \n 6:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 ， 看 为 善 的 ， 你 都 要 遵 行 ， 使 你 可 以 享 福 ， 并 可 以 进 去 得 耶 和 华 向 你 列 祖 起 誓 应 许 的 那 美 地 ， \n [kjv] And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, \n [bbe] And do what is upright and good in the eyes of the Lord your God, so that it may be well for you and you may go in and take for your heritage that good land from which the Lord undertook by an oath to your fathers, \n 6:19 [hgb] 照 耶 和 华 所 说 的 ， 从 你 面 前 撵 出 你 的 一 切 仇 敌 。 \n [kjv] To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. \n [bbe] To send out from before you all those who are against you. \n 6:20 [hgb] 日 后 ， 你 的 儿 子 问 你 说 ， 耶 和 华 我 们 神 吩 咐 你 们 的 这 些 法 度 ， 律 例 ， 典 章 是 什 么 意 思 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? \n [bbe] And when your son says to you in time to come, What is the reason for these rules and laws and decisions which the Lord our God has given you? \n 6:21 [hgb] 你 就 告 诉 你 的 儿 子 说 ， 我 们 在 埃 及 作 过 法 老 的 奴 仆 。 耶 和 华 用 大 能 的 手 将 我 们 从 埃 及 领 出 来 ， \n [kjv] Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh\u0027s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: \n [bbe] Then you will say to your son, We were servants under Pharaoh\u0027s yoke in Egypt; and the Lord took us out of Egypt with a strong hand: \n 6:22 [hgb] 在 我 们 眼 前 ， 将 重 大 可 怕 的 神 迹 奇 事 施 行 在 埃 及 地 和 法 老 并 他 全 家 的 身 上 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: \n [bbe] And the Lord did great signs and wonders against Egypt, and against Pharaoh and all his house, before our eyes: \n 6:23 [hgb] 将 我 们 从 那 里 领 出 来 ， 要 领 我 们 进 入 他 向 我 们 列 祖 起 誓 应 许 之 地 ， 把 这 地 赐 给 我 们 。 \n [kjv] And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. \n [bbe] And he took us out from that place, guiding us here to give us this land, as he said in his oath to our fathers. \n 6:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 吩 咐 我 们 遵 行 这 一 切 律 例 ， 要 敬 畏 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 ， 使 我 们 常 得 好 处 ， 蒙 他 保 全 我 们 的 生 命 ， 像 今 日 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. \n [bbe] And the Lord gave us orders to keep all these laws, in the fear of the Lord our God, so that it might be well for us for ever, and that he might keep us from death, as he has done to this day. \n 6:25 [hgb] 我 们 若 照 耶 和 华 我 们 神 所 吩 咐 的 一 切 诫 命 谨 守 遵 行 ， 这 就 是 我 们 的 义 了 。 \n [kjv] And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us. \n [bbe] And it will be our righteousness if we take care to keep all this order before the Lord our God as he has given it to us. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22/513.html","bookId":238,"book":{"id":238,"title":"Deuteronomy申命记（双语小说）","description":"简介： These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/22","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
