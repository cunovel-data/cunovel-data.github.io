London pet shop owner Frannie Pleasance has a mysterious way with animals and keeps her charges (and heart) locked in a veritable Eden. She thinks Casper Sterling is just another stray…until she takes in the troublesome lodger (and unwelcome suitor) and becomes the victim of a series of strange and dangerous occurrences. \n When an unexplained fire threatens to destroy Frannie\u0027s carefully guarded world, firefighter Thom Maccallan is there to extinguish the blaze and help gather the lost creatures. The heat between Frannie and Thom begins to burn, but someone\u0027s still after the lady. Could it be Casper himself, or is Frannie’s new lodger just another victim of fate? Will they be able to figure out who\u0027s pursuing Frannie—and stop them—before she loses everything?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-peculiar-pets-of-miss-pleasance-blud-2.jpg","author":"Delilah S.
