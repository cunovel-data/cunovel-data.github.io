{"id":6320,"no":4,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 4","content":"仅仅一年前我和莫娜每夜都沿着波拿巴街散步，那是在我们告别博罗夫斯基之后。当时圣绪尔比斯广场对我并不意味着什么，巴黎的景物对我都不意味着什么。我说话说累了，看人脸孔看烦了，逛大教堂、广场和动物园等地方也逛腻味了。在红色的卧室里找本书看吧，藤椅坐着不舒服。我整天坐着坐腻了，红色的壁纸叫人厌倦，看着这么多人没完没了地胡扯更叫人心烦。这问卧室和箱子总是打开的，莫娜的衣服杂乱无章地四处丢着。我的套鞋和手杖都在红卧室里，还有从未动过的笔记本和冷落在一旁的手稿。巴黎！巴黎意味着塞莱特咖啡馆、大教堂、多姆大饭店、跳蚤市尝美国捷运公司。巴黎！巴黎意味着博罗夫斯基的手杖、博罗夫斯基的帽子、博罗夫斯基的树胶水彩画、博罗夫斯基的史前鱼和史前笑话。一九二八年在巴黎，我仍记忆犹新的只有一夜—启程乘船去美国前的那一夜。\n And it was down the Rue Bonaparte that only a year before Mona and I used to walk every night, after we had taken leave of Borowski. St. Sulpice not meaning much to me then, nor anything in Paris. Washed out with talk. Sick of faces. Fed up with cathedrals and squares and menageries and what not. Picking up a book in the red bedroom and the cane chair uncomfortable; tired of sitting on my ass all day long, tired of red wallpaper, tired of seeing so many people jabbering away about nothing. The red bedroom and the trunk always open; her gowns lying about in a delirium of disorder. The red bedroom with my galoshes and canes, the notebooks I never touched, the manuscripts lying cold and dead Paris! Meaning the Café Select, the D?me, the Flea Market, the American Express. Paris! Meaning Borowski\u0027s canes, Borowski\u0027s hats, Borowski\u0027s gouaches, Borowski\u0027s prehistoric fish – and prehistoric jokes. In that Paris of \u002728 only one night stands out in my memory – the night before sailing for America.\n \n 　　那是一个难得的夜晚，博罗夫斯基有点儿醉了，他还有点儿讨厌我，因为我跟那儿的每一个婊子跳舞。不过我们早晨就要走了！我就是这样对我搂住的每一个女人说的—早晨就走！我就是这样对那个有双玛瑙色眼睛的金发女郎说的。到了卫生间里，我站在小便器前，下面勃起得很厉害，它显得既轻又重，像一只插上翅膀的枪弹。我就这样站在那儿时，两个女人溜进来了—美国女人。我双手握着阴茎，友好地同她们打招呼。她们朝我挤挤眼便走过去了。我正在走廊里系裤扣，便看到其中一个女人在等她朋友从厕所里出来。还在奏乐，也许莫娜会出来找我，或是博罗夫斯基拄着他的金柄手杖来，可我现在在这女人的怀抱中，她搂着我，我便不在乎谁会来，会发生什么事。\n A rare night, with Borowski slightly pickled and a little disgusted with me because I\u0027m dancing with every slut in the place. But we\u0027re leaving in the morning! That\u0027s what I tell every cunt I grab hold of – leaving in the morning! That\u0027s what I\u0027m telling the blonde with agate-colored eyes. And while I\u0027m telling her she takes my hand and squeezes it between her legs. In the lavatory I stand before the bowl with a tremendous erection; it seems light and heavy at the same time, like a piece of lead with wings on it. And while I\u0027m standing there like that two cunts sail in – Americans. I greet them cordially, prick in hand. They give me a wink and pass on. In the vestibule, as I\u0027m buttoning my fly, I notice one of them waiting for her friend to come out of the can. The music is still playing and maybe Mona\u0027ll be coming to fetch me, or Borowski with his gold knobbed cane, but I\u0027m in her arms now and she has hold of me and I don\u0027t care who comes or what happens.\n \n 　　我俩慢慢蠕动着钻进一个小房间，我让她手扶着墙弯腰俯在那儿。我试着把那东西插进去，可是不成功，于是我们又坐下试了一回，可还是不成功，无论怎样试都不行。她自始至终握着我的阴茎，活像握着一件救命的宝贝一样。可是没用，我们太兴奋、太急切了。还在奏乐，于是我俩又从小屋里匆匆出来回到走廊里。在厕所里我把精液全射在她的漂亮衣服上，为此她很生气。我摇摇晃晃回到桌旁，博罗夫斯基脸上红扑扑的，莫娜则责难地望着我。博罗夫斯基说，”咱们明天都去布鲁塞尔。”\n 　　大家都同意了，回到旅馆后我吐得到处都是，床上、脸盆里、衣物上、套鞋和手杖上，从未动过的笔记本和冷落在一旁的手稿上也吐上了。\n We wriggle into the cabinet and there I stand her up, slap up against the wall, and I try to get it into her but it won\u0027t work and so we sit down on the seat and try it that way but it won\u0027t work either. No matter how we try it it won\u0027t work. And all the while she\u0027s got hold of my prick, she\u0027s clutching it like a lifesaver, but it\u0027s no use, we\u0027re too hot, too eager. The music is still playing and so we waltz out of the cabinet into the vestibule again and as we\u0027re dancing there in the shithouse I come all over her beautiful gown and she\u0027s sore as hell about it. I stumble back to the table and there\u0027s Borowski with his ruddy face and Mona with her disapproving eye. And Borowski says \"Let\u0027s all go to Brussels tomorrow,\" and we agree, and when we get back to the hotel I vomit all over the place, in the bed, in the washbowl, over the suits and gowns and the galoshes and canes and the notebooks I never touched and the manuscripts cold and dead.\n \n 　　几个月后，还是在同一座旅馆的同一个房间里，我们望着窗外院子里的景物，自行车都放在那儿。楼上，阁楼底下有间小屋子，某位叫亚历克的活泼小伙子整天在放留声机，还扯着嗓门反复唱些美妙的歌儿。我说”我们”，可我这是把事情提前叙述了。莫娜一直不在，今天我就要去圣拉扎尔车站接她呢，临近傍晚，我把脸挤进两条栅栏之间站着等，可是没见莫娜，我又看了一遍电报也没能看出什么溪跷。于是我又回到拉丁区，照样大吃了一顿。过了一会儿从多姆大饭店前游逛而过时我突然看到一张苍白，臃肿的面孔和一对急不可耐的眼睛，还有一直令我心驰神往的夭鹅绒衣裳，因为在柔软的天鹅绒下总有她温暖的乳房、大理石般洁白的大腿和冰凉而又结实的肌肉。她从面孔的海洋中起身拥抱我，充满柔情地拥抱我---千只眼睛、鼻子、手指、腿、酒瓶、窗子、钱包和茶托都在瞪着我们，而我俩拥抱在一起，忘记了周围的一切。我在她身边坐下，她便说开了—滔滔不绝他说开了，这是歇斯底里、性变态和麻风病的狂热征兆。我连一个字也没听见，因为她很美，我爱她，现在我很快活，还愿意去死。\n A few months later. The same hotel, the same room. We look out on the courtyard where the bicycles are parked, and there is the little room up above, under the attic, where some smart young Alec played the phonograph all day long and repeated clever little things at the top of his voice. I say \"we\" but I\u0027m getting ahead of myself, because Mona has been away a long time and it\u0027s just today that I\u0027m meeting her at the Gare St. Lazare. Toward evening I\u0027m standing there with my face squeezed between the bars, but there\u0027s no Mona, and I read the cable over again but it doesn\u0027t help any. I go back to the Quarter and just the same I put away a hearty meal. Strolling past the Dame a little later suddenly I see a pale, heavy face and burning eyes – and the little velvet suit that I always adore because under the soft velvet there were always her warm breasts, the marble legs, cool, firm, muscular. She rises up out of a sea of faces and embraces me, embraces me passionately – a thousand eyes, noses, fingers, legs, bottles, windows, purses, saucers all glaring at us and we in each other\u0027s arms oblivious. I sit down beside her and she talks – a flood of talk. Wild consumptive notes of hysteria, perversion, leprosy. I hear not a word because she is beautiful and I love her and now I am happy and willing to die.\n \n 　　我们沿着城堡街漫步，找寻尤金。我们走过那座铁路桥，我常常在这儿看着火车驶出去，这时我在想她究竟在哪儿，心里也就很不好受了。过桥时一切都是软绵绵的、迷人的，烟雾从我们两腿间袅袅上升。铁轨嘎嘎作响、信号机在我们血液中闪烁，我觉察到她的身子紧紧贴着我的—全成为我的了，于是我停下用双手抚摸那温暖的天鹅绒。我们周围的一切都在碎裂，碎裂，天鹅绒下的温暖肉体渴望着我……我俩又回到原先那间屋子，多亏尤金，我们又弄到了五十法郎。我看看院子里，那部留声机已经停了，箱子打开着，奠娜的东西像往常一样丢了一地，她穿着衣服躺在床上，我催她一次、两次、三次、四次……我以为她要发疯了……躺在床上，盖着毯子，再摸摸她的身体多么好啊！可是能摸多久呢？这一回能持续下去吗？我已有了一种预感，这不会延续多久的。\n We walk down the Rue du Chateau, looking for Eugene. Walk over the railroad bridge where I used to watch the trains pulling out and feel all sick inside wondering where the hell she could be. Everything soft and enchanting as we walk over the bridge. Smoke coming up between our legs, the tracks creaking, semaphores in our blood. I feel her body close to mine – all mine now – and I stop to rub my hands over the warm velvet. Everything around us is crumbling, crumbling and the warm body under the warm velvet is aching for me…Back in the very same room and fifty francs to the good, thanks to Eugene. I look out on the court but the phonograph is silent. The trunk is open and her things are lying around everywhere just as before. She lies down on the bed with her clothes on. Once, twice, three times, four times … I\u0027m afraid she\u0027ll go mad … in bed, under the blankets, how good to feel her body again! But for how long? Willft last this time? Already I have a presentiment that it won\u0027t.\n \n 　　她狂热地跟我说话，仿佛我们没有明天一样。”别说了，莫娜！看着我……别说了！”最后她睡着了，我从她身下抽出胳膊。\n She talks to me so feverishly – as if there will be no tomorrow. \"Be quiet, Mona! Just look at me … don\u0027t talk.\" Finally she drops off and I pull my arm from under her.\n \n 　　我闭上眼，她就躺在我身边……到早上当然还在……我是在二月里从码头启程的，那天下着一场叫人睁不开眼睛的暴风雪。我最后一次看到她时她在窗口同我挥手道别，当时街对面角落里站着一个男人，他的帽子拉下来遮住眼睛，下颚贴在西服翻领上。这个望着我的人是个胎儿，一个嘴里叼着雪茄的胎儿。莫娜在窗口向我挥手道别，脸色苍白而臃肿，披头散发，忽而又到了一个阴沉沉的卧室中，我俩有节奏地喘着气，她身上散发出一种温暖的、猫身上的气味，她的秀发叼在我嘴里。我闭着眼，我们对着嘴呼出一口口热气。我俩紧贴在一起，距美国有三千英里之遥，可我再也不想它了。同她在这儿睡在床上、让她对着我呼吸、秀发含在我嘴里—我认为这是一种奇迹。天亮以前什么事都不会发生……\n My eyes dose. Her body is there beside me … it will be there till morning surely… It was in February I pulled out of the harbor in a blinding snowstorm. The last glimpse I had of her was in the window waving good bye to me. A man standing on the other side of the street, at the corner, his hat pulled down over his eyes, his jowls resting on his lapels. A fetus watching me. A fetus with a cigar in its mouth. Mona at the window waving good-bye. White heavy face, hair streaming wild. And now it is a heavy bedroom, breathing regularly through the gills, sap still oozing from between her legs, a warm feline odor and her hair in my mouth. My eyes are closed. We breathe warmly into each other\u0027s mouth. Close together, America three thousand miles away. I never want to see it again. To have her here in bed with me, breathing on me, her hair in my mouth – I count that something of a miracle. Nothing can happen now till morning…\n \n 我从酣睡中醒来望着她，这时一缕微弱的光线透进来，我望着她美丽的蓬乱头发，觉得有样东西顺着她的脖子爬下来。我又凑近看看她，她的头发在动。我扯开床单，看到更多的臭虫，它们在枕头上排成一大片。\n I wake from a deep slumber to look at her. A pale light is trickling in. I look at her beautiful wild hair. I feel something crawling down my neck. I look at her again, closely. Her hair is alive. I pull back the sheet – more of them. They are swarming over the pillow.\n \n 　　拂晓，我们匆忙收拾起东西溜出旅馆，这时街上的咖啡馆还没有开门。我们步行，边走边搔痒。天亮了，天边出现了一片奶白色的晨喷，一朵朵橙红色的彩云飘过天空，恰似蜗牛出壳。巴黎啊，巴黎，一切都发生在这儿。断垣残壁、小便池中悦耳的哗哗流水声、男人们在酒吧间里舔小胡子。窗板往上推时铿锵作响，街沟里水流潺潺有声。还有用鲜红的巨大字母拼成AmerPicon之字形。咱们走哪条路：为什么？往哪儿走，干什么？\n It is a little after daybreak. We pack hurriedly and sneak out of the hotel. The cafés are still closed. We walk, and as we walk we scratch ourselves. The day opens in milky whiteness, streaks of salmon – pink sky, snails leaving their shells. Paris. Paris. Everything happens here. Old, crumbling walls and the pleasant sound of water running in the urinals. Men licking their mustaches at the bar. Shutters going up with a bang and little streams purling in the gutters. Amer Picon in huge scarlet letters. Zigzag. Which way will we go and why or where or what?\n \n 　　莫娜饿了，而且她的衣服很单保除了晚礼服、香水、俗气的耳环、手镯和脱毛剂，她什么也没有。我们在梅园大道上一家弹子房中坐下要了热咖啡。卫生间坏了。我们得坐一阵了才能去另一家旅馆，这时我们互相拣去了对方头发里的臭虫。莫娜紧张不安，所以发起脾气来。非得洗个澡，非得干这，非得干那。非得、非得……”你还剩下多少钱？”\n Mona is hungry, her dress is thin. Nothing but evening wraps, bottles of perfume, barbaric earrings, bracelets, depilatories. We sit down in a billiard parlor on the Avenue du Maine and order hot coffee. The toilet is out of order. We shall have to sit some time before we can go to another hotel. Meanwhile we pick bedbugs out of each other\u0027s hair. Nervous. Mona is losing her temper. Must have a bath. Must have this. Must have that. Must, must, must …\"How much money have you left?\"\n 钱！全忘掉了。\n Money! Forgot all about that.\n \n 　　美国饭店。那儿有部电梯。 我们在大白天便上床睡觉了。待我们起来天色已黑，这时要做的头一件事便是凑足往美国打一份电报的钱。电报就打给那个嘴里叼着长长的、有味道的雪茄的胎儿。还要去拉斯帕伊林荫道找那个西班牙女人，做顿热饭是她的拿手好戏。天一亮便会发生什么事的。至少我们可以一起上床了。再也没有臭虫了。雨季已开始。床单干净极了……\n H?tel des Etats Unis. An ascenseur. We go to bed in broad daylight. When we get up it is dark and the first thing to do is to raise enough dough to send a cable to America. A cable to the fetus with the long juicy cigar in his mouth. Meanwhile there is the Spanish woman on the Boulevard Raspail – she\u0027s always good for a warm meal. By morning something will happen. At least we\u0027re going to bed together. No more bedbugs now. The rainy season has commenced. The sheets are immaculate…\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/242/280.html","bookId":205,"book":{"id":205,"title":"北回归线 Tropic Of Cancer","description":"简介： Tropic of Cancer is a novel by Henry Miller, first published in 1934 by the Obelisk Press in Paris, France.
