{"id":6366,"no":50,"title":"Part 15 Chapter 1","content":"待我设法逃离这座感化院已是春天了，那还是因为命运的巧妙安排。有一天卡尔打电报通知我“楼上”腾出了一个空位置。他说如果我打算接受这个工作他就寄路费来。我马上拍了回电，钱一寄到我就直奔火车站，跟勒普罗维西厄或其他人什么都没有说。正如人们所说，我是不辞而别了。\n It was spring before I managed to escape from the penitentiary, and then only by a stroke of fortune. A telegram from Carl informed me one day that there was a vacancy \"upstairs\"; he said he would send me the fare back if I decided to accept. I telegraphed back at once and as soon as the dough arrived I beat it to the station. Not a word to M. le Proviseur or anyone. French leave, as they say.\n \n 　　我一下车便立刻来到一号乙的那家旅馆，卡尔就住在这儿。他一丝不挂来开门，这天他是晚上休息，同往常一样床上有个女人。他说，“别管她，她睡着了。假如你想睡女人就睡她好了，她还不坏。”他拉开被子让我看看她的容貌，可是我还不想马上睡女人。我太激动了，像一个刚刚从狱中逃出的犯人。我只是想看、想听。从车站一路走来，像是做了一场大梦，我觉得自己已离开了很多年。\n I went immediately to the hotel at 1 bis, where Carl was staying. He came to the door stark naked. It was his night off and there was a cunt in the bed as usual. \"Don\u0027t mind her,\" he says, \"she\u0027s asleep. If you need a lay you can take her on. She\u0027s not bad.\" He pulls the covers back to show me what she looks like. However, I wasn\u0027t thinking about a lay right away. I was too excited. I was like a man who has just escaped from jail. I just wanted to see and hear things. Coming from the station it was like a long dream. I felt as though I had been away for years.\n \n 　　直到坐下来好好打量了一番这间屋子后，我才悟到自己又回到了巴黎。这是卡尔的房间，一点儿不错，像一个松鼠笼和厕所的结合。桌上几乎找不到一块能放他的袖珍打字机的地方，而且总是这副样子，无论他是否和一个女人同居。一本词典总是打开压在一卷涂了金边的《浮士德》上面，总摆着一只装烟草的袋子、一顶贝雷帽、一瓶红酒、信件、手槁、旧报纸、水彩、茶壶、脏袜子、牙签、克鲁什深嗅盐、避孕套，等等。洗身盆里扔着桔子皮和吃剩的火腿三明治残渣。\n It was not until I had sat down and taken a good look at the room that I realized I was back again in Paris. It was Carl\u0027s room and no mistake about it. Like a squirrel cage and shithouse combined. There was hardly room on the table for the portable machine he used. It was always like that, whether he had a cunt with him or not. Always a dictionary lying open on a gilt edged volume of Faust, always a tobacco pouch, a beret, a bottle of vin rouge, letters, manuscripts, old newspapers, water colors, teapot, dirty socks, toothpicks, Kruschen Salts, condoms, etc. In the bidet were orange peels and the remnants of a ham sandwich.\n \n 　　卡尔说，“食品橱里有吃的，自己拿吧！刚才我正要给自己打一针呢。”\n \"There\u0027s some food in the closet\" he said. \"Help yourself! I was just going to give myself an injection.\"\n \n 　　我找到了他说的那个三明治和三明治旁他啃过的一块奶酪。他坐在床边给自己注射弱蛋白银，与此同时，我吃光了三明治和奶酪，还有一点甜酒。\n I found the sandwich he was talking about and a piece of cheese that he had nibbled at beside it. While he sat on the edge of the bed, dosing himself with his argyrol, I put away the sandwich and cheese with the aid of a little wine.\n \n 　　他用一条脏裤头擦擦自己的阴茎说，“我喜欢你写来的那封谈歌德的信。”\n \"I liked that letter you sent me about Goethe,\" he said, wiping his prick with a dirty pair of drawers.\n \n 　　“我马上就给你看我的答复，我要把它写进我的书里。你的问题在于你不是德国人，要理解歌德你必须是德国人。得了，我现在不打算给你解释了，我已经把它全写进书里……顺便说说，我现在又新弄到一个女人—不是这一个—这一个是个傻瓜。我是几天前才把她弄到手的，我说不上她还会不会来。你不在时她一直跟我一起住，那天她爹妈来把她领走了。他们说她才十五岁。你能想到吗？他们还把我吓得屁滚尿流……”我大笑起来，卡尔正是一个把自己置于这种狼狈境地的人。\n \"I\u0027ll show you the answer to it in a minute – I\u0027m putting it in my book. The trouble with you is that you\u0027re not a German. You have to be German to understand Goethe. Shit, I\u0027m not going to explain it to you now. I\u0027ve put it all in the book… By the way, I\u0027ve got a new cunt now – not this one – this one\u0027s a half wit. At least, I had her until a few days ago. I\u0027m not sure whether she\u0027ll come back or not. She was living with me all the time you were away. The other day her parents came and took her away. They said she was only fifteen. Can you beat that? They scared the shit out of me too…\" I began to laugh. It was like Carl to get himself into a mess like that.\n \n 　　他说，“你笑什么，也许我会为这个坐牢的。还好，我没有叫她怀上孕。不过这也很奇怪，因为她从来不采取妥当的措施照顾自己。你知道是什么救了我？照我看，是《浮士德》。就是！她老子正巧看见它放在桌上，他问我懂不懂德文。事情这样一件件连下去，不等我省悟过来他已经瞧开我的书了。幸好我凑巧把莎士比亚的剧本也摊开了，这使他大力吃惊，说我显然是一个非常严肃的人。”\n \"What are you laughing for?\" he said. \"I may go to prison for it. Luckily, I didn\u0027t knock her up. And that\u0027s funny, too, because she never took care of herself properly. But do you know what saved me? So I think, at least. It was Faust. Yeah! Her old man happened to see it lying on the table. He asked me if I understood German. One thing led to another and before I knew it he was looking through my books. Fortunately I happened to have the Shakespeare open too. That impressed him like hell. He said I was evidently a very serious guy.\"\n \n 　　“那个姑娘呢？她怎么说？”\n \"What about the girl – what did she have to say?\"\n \n 　　“她吓得要死。你瞧，她来时戴着一块小手表，可慌乱中我们找不到这块表了。她老妈一定要叫我找到它，否则就叫警察。 这你就明白当时的情形了。我把整个房间翻了个底朝天，可还是找不到那块见鬼的手表。那当妈的气疯了。尽管她对我很不客气，我还是喜欢她，她比她女儿长得还漂亮呢。瞧，我要给你看看我刚刚开头写给她的信，我爱上她了……”\n \"She was frightened to death. You see, she had a little watch with her when she came; in the excitement we couldn\u0027t find the watch, and her mother insisted that the watch be found or she\u0027d call the police. You see how things are here. I turned the whole place upside down – but I couldn\u0027t find the goddamned watch. The mother was furious. I liked her too, in spite of everything. She was even better looking than the daughter. Here – I\u0027ll show you a letter I started to write her. I\u0027m in love with her…\"\n \n “爱上当妈的了？”\n \"With the mother?\"\n \n 　　“对了。为什么不行？假如我先看到的是她妈，我绝不会再瞧女儿一眼。我怎么知道她才只有十五岁？你睡一个女人之前总不会先问她多大了，对吗？”\n \"Sure. Why not? If I had seen the mother first I\u0027d never have looked at the daughter. How did I know she was only fifteen? You don\u0027t ask a cunt how old she is before you lay her, do you?\"\n \n 　　“乔，这件事情有点儿古怪。你不想哄我吧？”\n \"Joe, there\u0027s something funny about this. You\u0027re not shitting me, are you?\"\n \n “哄你？瞧，瞧瞧这个！”说着他给我看了那个姑娘画的水彩画，画的是娇小可爱的物件—一把刀子和一条面包、桌子和茶壶，每一样东西部越画越高。卡尔又说，“她爱上我了。她像个孩子，我得告诉她什么时候刷牙、教她怎样戴帽子。瞧这儿，瞧瞧这些棒棒糖。我每天总要给她买几根棒棒糖，她喜欢棒棒糖。”\n \"Am I shitting you? Here – look at this!\" And he shows me the water colors the girl had made – cute little things – a knife and a loaf of bread, the table and teapot, everything running uphill. \"She was in love with me,\" he said. \"She was just like a child. I had to tell her when to brush her teeth and how to put her, hat on. Here – look at the lollypops! I used to buy her a few lollypops every day – she liked them.\"\n \n 　　“那么她爹妈来带她走时她怎么样，大吵大闹了吗？”\n \"Well, what did she do when her parents came to take her away? Didn\u0027t she put up a row?\"\n \n 　　“哭了几声就完了。她能干什么？不到法定自立年龄……我不得不保证不再见她，也不写信。我现在等着瞧的就是—她会不会躲着不露面。她来这儿那会儿还是处女。关键在于，她不跟男人睡能熬多久？在这儿时她怎么也睡不够，差点儿把我累趴下了。”\n \"She cried a little, that\u0027s all. What could she do? She\u0027s under age… I had to promise never to see her again, never to write her either. That\u0027s what I\u0027m waiting to see now – whether she\u0027ll stay away or not. She was a virgin when she came here. The thing is, how long will she be able to go without a lay? She couldn\u0027t get enough of it when she was here. She almost wore me out.\"\n \n 　　这时床上那个姑娘醒了，正揉眼睛呢。照我看她也挺小的，长得不丑，不过蠢得要命，想马上知道我们在谈什么。\n By this time the one in bed had come to and was rubbing her eyes. She looked pretty young to me, too. Not bad looking but dumb as hell. Wanted to know right away what we were talking about.\n \n 　　卡尔说，“她就住在这个旅馆里，二楼，你想到她的房间去吗？我替你安排。”\n \"She lives here in the hotel,\" said Carl. \"On the third floor. Do you want to go to her room? I\u0027ll fix it up for you.\"\n \n 　　不就是她从前常挨揍，你是了解这些法国娘儿们的，她们一恋爱就会失去理智。”\n \n 　　很明显，我不在这儿期间已经发生了一些事情。听说了菲尔莫的不幸我很难过，他从前对我好得要命。同范诺登分手后，我跳上一辆公共汽车径直来到医院。\n 　　我估计他们还没有认定菲尔莫是否完全神经错乱了，因为我在楼上一个单人病房里找到了他，他仍享有正常病人的一切自由。我去时他刚刚洗完澡，一看到我他便失声痛哭起来。他立刻说，“全完了，他们说我疯了，也许还得了梅毒。他们说我有夸大妄想。”他倒在床上轻声啜泣，哭了一阵又抬起头来微笑了—真像一只刚刚睡醒的小鸟儿。他说，“他们为什么不把我安排在普通病房里，或疯人院里？我可付不起这笔钱，我只剩下最后五百美元了。”\n 　　我说，“这正是他们留你住在这儿的原因，等你的钱花光了他们会很快叫你搬走的。你不用操心。”\n 　　我的话一定说动了他，我话音未落他就把他的表、表链、钱夹、兄弟会证章等东西全交给我。他说，“把这些收好。这伙王八蛋想抢光我的所有东西。”突然他又大笑起来，这种古怪、郁郁寡欢的笑声会使你坚信这个笑的人愚不可及，不论他是不是真的蠢，他说，“我知道你会认为我疯了，可我想弥补我做的事情，我想结婚。你瞧，我并不知道自己有性病，我把病传染给她，又叫她怀了孕。我对医生说了，我不在乎自己会怎样，可是我要他准许我先结婚。他说是要我等好一点了再说，可我知道永远不会好了。我这就完蛋了。”\n 　　听他这么说我忍不住也笑了，我不明白他这是怎么了。总之我只得答应去看看那个姑娘，向她解释解释这些事情。他要我支持她、安慰她，还说了他可以信赖我之类的话。为了宽他我自己也说不上想不想去，看到卡尔又同她调起情来，我才决定去。我先问她是不是大累。这是一个没有用处的问题，一个婊子永远不会累得分不开她的两条腿，尽管有些人会在你趴在她们身上折腾时睡着。总之我们商定到她的房间去，这样这一夜我就不用给旅馆老板付钱了。\n I didn\u0027t know whether I wanted to or not, but when I saw Carl mushing it up with her again I decided I did want to. I asked her first if she was too tired. Useless question. A whore is never too tired to open her legs. Some of them can fall asleep while you diddle them. Anyway, it was decided we would go down to her room. Like that I wouldn\u0027t have to pay the patron for the night.\n \n 　　到了早上我租了一个俯瞰底下小庭院的房间，背着夹板广告牌做广告的人总到这个小院子里来吃午饭。中午我叫卡尔一同去吃早饭，我不在期间他和范诺登新近养成了一种习惯—每天去库波勒饭店吃早饭。我问，“为什么非去库波勒？”卡尔答道，“为什么非去库波勒？因为库波勒全天都上麦片粥，麦片粥是叫你吃了拉屎的。”我说，“明白了。”\n In the morning I rented a room overlooking the little park down below where the sandwich-board men always came to eat their lunch. At noon I called for Carl to have breakfast with him. He and Van Norden had developed a new habit in my absence – they went to the Coupole for breakfast every day. \"Why the Coupole?\" I asked. \"Why the Coupole?\" says Carl. \"Because the Coupole serves porridge at all hours and porridge makes you shit.\" – \"I see,\" said I.\n \n 　　于是生活又像以前一样，我们三人步行上下班，常发生小口角、小争斗。范诺登仍为了他的女人、为了把肚子里的脏东西冲洗出来而发牢骚，只是现在发现了一种新消遣，他发现手淫不那么令人烦恼。他把这个新闻告诉我后，我着实诧异了一阵，我认为像他这样一个家伙不可能在自慰中得到乐趣。他又向我描绘他是如何弄的，这就更使我十分诧异不已了。用他的话说，他“发明”了一种新技艺。他说，“你拿一个苹果，挖掉果心，然后在里面抹一些冷奶油，这样它就不会化得太快了。哪一天试试看！一开始会叫你神魂颠倒的。不管怎样，这个办法很便宜，也不用费多少时间。”\n So it\u0027s just like it used to be again. The three of us walking back and forth to work. Petty dissensions, petty rivalries. Van Norden still bellyaching about his cunts and about washing the dirt out of his belly. Only now he\u0027s found a new diversion. He\u0027s found that it\u0027s less annoying to masturbate. I was amazed when he broke the news to me. I didn\u0027t think it possible for a guy like that to find any pleasure in jerking himself off. I was still more amazed when he explained to me how he goes about it. He had \"invented\" a new stunt, so he put it. \"You take an apple,\" he says, \"and you bore out the core. Then you rub some cold cream on the inside so as it doesn\u0027t melt too fast. Try it some time! It\u0027ll drive you crazy at first. Anyway, it\u0027s cheap and you don\u0027t have to waste much time.\n \n 　　他换了一个话题，又说，“对了，你的那位朋友菲尔莫住进了医院。我想他是疯了，反正这是他的姑娘告诉我的。你不在时他找了一个法国姑娘，他俩一度打架打得很厉害。女的是一个大块头、很壮实的婊子，是那种粗蛮的女人。我倒不在乎跟她睡一回，只是怕她会把我的眼珠子抠出来。菲尔莫经常脸上、手上带着抓破的伤痕走来走去，有时她也显得被人揍肿了，要的心，我答应了他提出的一切。我并不觉得他确实疯了。只是有点儿灰心丧气。是典型的盎格鲁-撒克逊人的心理危机，是道德准则的突然萌发。我对这个姑娘抱有很强烈的好奇心，想知道整个事情的内幕。\n Evidently things had happened while I was away. I was sorry to hear about Fillmore. He had been damned good to me. When I left Van Norden I jumped a bus and went straight to the hospital.\n They hadn\u0027t decided yet whether he was completely off his base or not, I suppose, for I found him upstairs in a private room, enjoying all the liberties of the regular patients. He had just come from the bath when I arrived. When he caught sight of me he burst into tears. \"It\u0027s all over,\" he says immediately. \"They say I\u0027m crazy – and I may have syphilis too. They say I have delusions of grandeur.\" He fell over onto the bed and wept quietly. After he had wept a while he lifted his head up and smiled – just like a bird coming out of a snooze. \"Why do they put me in such an expensive room?\" he said. \"Why don\u0027t they put me in the ward – or in the bughouse? I can\u0027t afford to pay for this. I\u0027m down to my last five hundred dollars.\"\n \"That\u0027s why they\u0027re keeping you here,\" I said. \"They\u0027ll transfer you quickly enough when your money runs out. Don\u0027t worry.\"\n My words must have impressed him, for I had no sooner finished than he handed me his watch and chain, his wallet, his fraternity pin, etc. \"Hold on to them,\" he said. \"These bastards\u0027ll rob me of everything I\u0027ve got.\" And then suddenly he began to laugh, one of those weird, mirthless laughs which makes you believe a guy\u0027s goofy whether he is or not. \"I know you\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy,\" he said, \"but I want to atone for what I did. I want to get married. You see, I didn\u0027t know I had the clap. I gave her the clap and then I knocked her up. I told the doctor I don\u0027t care what happens to me, but I want him to let me get married first. He keeps telling me to wait until I get better but I know I\u0027m never going to get better. This is the end.\"\n I couldn\u0027t help laughing myself, hearing him talk that way. I couldn\u0027t understand what had come over him. Anyway, I had to promise him to see the girl and explain things to her. He wanted me to stick by her, comfort her. Said he could trust me, etc. I said yes to everything in order to soothe him. He didn\u0027t seem exactly nuts to me – just caved in like. Typical Anglo Saxon crisis. An eruption of morals. I was rather curious to see the girl, to get the lowdown on the whole thing.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/242/326.html","bookId":205,"book":{"id":205,"title":"北回归线 Tropic Of Cancer","description":"简介： Tropic of Cancer is a novel by Henry Miller, first published in 1934 by the Obelisk Press in Paris, France.
