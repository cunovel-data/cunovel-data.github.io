The man, past middle age, gyrated fiercely and growled and grunted with primordial savagery, and even slapped the young woman across the face once in his climactic delirium.\n Then it ended, like the snap of fingers, and the man pulled himself off the young girl and lowered his many-layered red, gold, and white robes as he calmly walked away with not a look back at the deflowered creature. For Principal Cleric Yozumian Dudui Yinochek, the Blessed Voice Proper of the Protector\u0027s House, the most powerful man in at least one entire ward of the port city of Memnon, had not the time to consider the rabble.\n His pursuits were intellectual, his obstacles physical, and his \"flock\" often more an inconvenience than a source of strength.\n He walked stiff-legged and swayed a bit as he crossed the cluttered room, his energy spent. He considered the carts and the crates, the canvas sacks and piled tools. Rarely did he or any of the clerics of Selune, who controlled the all-important tides, go to that room for purposes other than that one. The place was dirty and smelled of brine; it was a chamber for the servants and not the blessed clerics. The place had only a single redeeming quality: a fairly secretive door heading out to the street, through which \"visitors\" could readily be smuggled.\n That thought turned the principal cleric back to the young woman, barely more than a girl. She cried, but was apparently wise enough not to whine too loudly and insult his performance. She was in pain of course, but it would pass. Her confusion and inner tumult would be more damaging than the sting of a punctured hymen, Yinochek knew.\n \"You performed a valuable service to Selune this night,\" he said to her. \"Free of my earthly desires, I can better contemplate the mysteries of paradise, and as they are revealed to me, the road to redemption will be better shown to you and to your failing father. Here.\"\n He lifted a loaf of stale bread he had set on a cart by the hall door when he had entered, and gave it a shake to dislodge a few of the crawling creatures, then tossed it to her. She caught it and clutched it tightly, desperately to her breast. That brought a condescending chuckle from Yinochek.\n \"You treasure it, of course,\" he said. \"Because you do not understand that your greater reward will be the result of my contemplations. You are so rooted in the needs of the physical that you cannot begin to comprehend the divine.\"\n With a derisive snort at the blank, tear-streaked expression that came back at him, Yinochek turned to the door and pulled it open, startling a handsome young cleric.\n \"Devout Gositek,\" he greeted.\n \"My apologies, Principal,\" Papan Gositek said, crossing his arms at his belt and bending stiffly in supplication. \"I heard...\"\n \"Yes, I am finished,\" Yinochek explained, glancing back and leading Gositek\u0027s gaze to the woman, who slowly rocked and clutched at the bread. The principal cleric turned back to the younger priest.\n \"Your treatise on the Promise of Ibrandul awaits me in my quarters,\" he said, and the young priest beamed. \"I have been told that your insights are nothing short of brilliant, and from what I have perused, I am finding that the rumors are credible. So misunderstood is that god, whose domain is death itself.\"\n Gositek\u0027s teeth showed, despite his strenuous attempt at humility.\n \"Your work proceeds?\" Yinochek asked, and he knew he had caught the young man in a prideful gloat.\n \"Y-yes, yes, Principal,\" Gositek stammered, respectfully lowering his gaze.\n Yinochek hid his amusement. Pride was considered a weakness of course, even a sin, but Yinochek understood the truth of the matter: absent pride, no young man would undertake the rigors of such contemplation. He shifted aside just a bit as Gositek began to lift his head, allowing the man a view of the shivering girl.\n Gositek\u0027s eyes, and even a little lick of his lips, betrayed his lust.\n \"Take her,\" Yinochek offered. \"She is pained, if you care, but your work is more important than her comfort. Release your earthly passions and find a state of contemplation. I am beyond curious to view your thesis regarding the godly propaganda ploys of the Fugue Plane. The thought of the gods themselves vying for the souls of the uncommitted dead fascinates me, and presents opportunities for us to recruit for the worship of Selune.\"\n Yinochek turned to the girl. \"Your dead mother has not yet attained paradise,\" he said, and he didn\u0027t even try to hide his contemptuous snicker. \"Devout Gositek here,\" he stepped aside so that she could better see the man, \"prays for her. Your attention to his needs will allow him to better assure her ascent.\"\n He turned back to Gositek and shrugged. \"It will be better this way,\" he said, and walked out of the room.\n The girl was all but forgotten by Yinochek by the time he arrived at his chamber on the temple\u0027s third and highest floor. He moved past his wooden desk - polished and rich in hue, unlike the gray and grainy driftwood that was most often used in the desert port. The wood had been imported, as was the case with most of the implements, furniture, and decorations of the fabulous temple, by far the largest and most grand structure in the southwestern quarter of the sprawling city.\n Divine contemplations required inspirational surroundings.\n Yinochek moved to the western door, the one that led to the private balcony, in the great temple known as the Protector\u0027s House. There resided the priests of Selune, the Moon Goddess, and their sister faiths of Valkur and Shaundakul. The single encompassing structure was the center of prayer and contemplation, with a growing library that was fast becoming the envy of the Sword Coast. That library had expanded considerably - and ironically - only a few years earlier, soon after the Time of Troubles, when a cult of the death god Ibrandul had been discovered in the catacombs of that very building. Flushed from their secrecy, not all of those rogue priests had been killed. Under the daring and bold command of Yinochek, many had been assimilated. \"Expand the knowledge,\" he had told his doubting lessers.\n Of course, they had done it secretly.\n The balcony was shielded from the ever-prying eyes of idiot peasants who continually gathered in the square below, begging indulgences or healing spells when they had not the coin to pay. His other balcony didn\u0027t have the angled high railing to prevent those spiritual beggars from viewing him. Yinochek could view the harbor in full, a round moon setting beyond the watery horizon, silhouetting the tall masts of the great trading ships moored off the coast as they swayed with the rhythmic, gentle waves. That natural harmony reminded the principal cleric of his lovemaking that night, creating in him a connectedness to the universe and lifting him to thoughts of eternity and oneness with Selune. He sighed and basked in the moment. Physically sated of base and corrupting urges, he soared among the stars and the gods, and more than an hour passed, the moon disappearing from sight, before he turned his thoughts to Gositek\u0027s brilliant thesis.\n He had found inner peace and so he could find Selune.\n He couldn\u0027t even remember what his shivering vessel had looked like that night, nor did he care to try. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/road-of-the-patriarch-the-sellswords-3/page-19.html","bookId":2139,"book":{"id":2139,"title":"Road of the Patriarch (The Sellswords #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Sellswords #3: Road of the Patriarch \n Explore the mind of an assassin in R.A.
