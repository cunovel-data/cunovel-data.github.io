{"id":95508,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"INDULGING THE GODS Well, now we\u0027re knowing why the last fool died,\" Athrogate said when he and his two companions entered the house that had been offered to them in the southwestern quarter of Memnon. They had come into the city earlier that morning, and on Entreri\u0027s insistence - at least for himself - had eschewed the better sections of the port, where all the taverns were located, and had gone straight to a ramshackle district where the houses were no more than flimsy walls and floors of stone and dirt - and that was for the people fortunate enough to even have a shelter at all. Many of their neighbors, the poorest citizens by far in the city, slept on the side of the sandy avenues, often without even lean-tos to protect them from the occasional rains. A flash of gold from Jarlaxle had spared the trio that fate, at least, and the man, one of the clerks from the Protector\u0027s House, the temple of Selune, had told them of their good fortune, for the owner of the house had recently departed the mortal world, leaving it open for the taking. Jarlaxle groaned when he entered behind the dwarf, and knew he had greatly over-bribed the clerk. The place was no more than four walls, a roof that showed as much sky as reed, a floor of dirt, and a single table of piled stones so covered by crawling bugs - evil-looking reddish-brown critters with long pincers and an upward-curling tail - that it seemed obvious to the drow that the creatures had called the place home for a long, long time. Athrogate walked over to the table and snorted, seeming amused. \"Back home, we had a name for this,\" he said, and he extended one fat thumb and squished a crawler flat with a crunching sound. \"Buffet.\" \"Do not dare eat that,\" said Jarlaxle, and Athrogate gave one of his characteristic \"bwahahas\" in reply. Entreri walked in last. He glanced around and gave it all hardly a thought. \"Seemin\u0027 a bit too familiar to ye, by me own thinkin\u0027,\" Athrogate teased. Entreri looked at him out of the corner of his eye, but just shook his head and turned away. \"They have midday services in the square overlooking the docks,\" he said to Jarlaxle. \"I will be there, south side of the Protector\u0027s House.\" He turned and started back out the ill-fitting door. \"You are leaving us?\" the drow asked. \"I never invited you here to begin with,\" Entreri reminded him as he walked away. \"Bwahaha!\" roared Athrogate. \"Enough, good dwarf,\" Jarlaxle said, though he never took his eyes off the door. \"This is difficult for our friend.\" \"Place didn\u0027t seem to bother him all that much,\" said Athrogate. Jarlaxle turned to face him. \"This?\" he asked. \"I suspect that Artemis Entreri is well acquainted with similar accommodations. But returning to this city, the place of his birth and early life, brings with it some painful memories, I would expect, which is why he needed to come here.\" To Jarlaxle\u0027s surprise, Athrogate winced at that, and nodded but didn\u0027t otherwise reply, a very uncharacteristic response that revealed quite a bit to the perceptive, worldly drow. \"So are ye thinking the time\u0027s come to do some drinking?\" the dwarf blurted. \"I a\u0027weighin\u0027 to go hear the prayin\u0027, or to make me a treat with these critters to eat! Bwahaha!\" \"Is that all there is to Athrogate?\" Jarlaxle asked in all seriousness, cutting short the dwarf\u0027s outburst. Athrogate stared at him hard, suddenly sobered. \"You are free of all feelings, it seems, other than your own humor,\" Jarlaxle pressed, and Athrogate\u0027s face tightened with every word. \"Such as it is. Is there nothing but your pleasure?\" \"I might be saying the same to yerself.\" \"You might, but my answer would involve a long history of explanation.\" \"Or ye might be telling me to mind me own business.\" \"Indeed, and which will you do, my hairy friend?\" \"Ye\u0027re going to a place where ye don\u0027t belong.\" \"Your level of carefree is not attained without cause,\" said the drow. \"Something to drink, something to hit, and a joke to make them groan - is that all there is to Athrogate?\" \"Ye don\u0027t know nothing.\" Indeed, Jarlaxle thought and smirked and decided to keep the irony of that double negative to himself. \"So tell me.\" Athrogate ground his teeth and slowly shook his head. \"Should I fill you with potent drink before I ask such things?\" Jarlaxle asked. \"Ye do and ye\u0027ll find the ball end of a morningstar crunched into the side o\u0027 yer head.\" Jarlaxle took the threat with a laugh, and let it drop. In discussion, at least, for in his thoughts he played it through over and over again. Something had created Athrogate as he was; something had broken the dwarf to that base level, where he had no emotional defense other than a wall of ridicule and self-ridicule, fastened by the occasional rap of a mighty morningstar and hidden by the more-than-occasional drink. Jarlaxle nodded, thinking that he had just found something interesting, something he meant to explore, despite the dwarf\u0027s very serious threat. The scene was all too familiar to Artemis Entreri and sent his thoughts careening back across the years. Before him, in the wide square that fronted the gigantic Protector\u0027s House, by far the largest structure in that part of the city, stood, sat, and lay the rabble of southwestern Memnon. They were the dispossessed, the poorest of the poor in the city, nearly all of them suffering the maladies so common among those who could not find enough to eat or drink, who could not keep clean, who could not find shelter from the rain. But they were not hopeless. No, the men on the eastern side of the square, richly dressed and bejeweled, would not allow for such a state of despair. They called out in melodic voices of the glories of Selune and of the wonders that awaited her servants. Their pages went among the crowd, offering good news and good cheer, speaking of salvation and promises of an eternity free of all pain. But there was more to this than cheerleading, Entreri knew all too well. There were promises of immediate relief from ailments, and even suggestions - normally reserved for grieving parents - that the afterlife for their dearly departed could be made even more accommodating than the promises of their god. \"Would you have your child suffer on the Fugue Plane a moment longer than he must?\" one young acolyte said to a tearful woman not far from Entreri. \"Of course not! Come along, good woman. Every moment we tarry is another moment your dear Toyjo will suffer.\" It wasn\u0027t the first time the acolyte had pulled that same woman forward, Entreri could tell, and he watched as the pair shuffled through the crowd, the acolyte tugging her along. \"By Moradin, but yerselfs are calling me kin heartless,\" Athrogate muttered as he and Jarlaxle walked up beside Entreri. \"Such a brotherhood ye got here. Makes me want to be findin\u0027 a wizard that\u0027d polymorph me into a human.\" He ended with a fake sniffle, and wiped his eye. Entreri flashed him a sour look, but as he was no more enamored with his fellow humans than was Athrogate, he really had no practical response. He looked to Jarlaxle instead - and did a double-take, still not used to seeing the drow with golden hair and tanned skin. \"You know this scene?\" Jarlaxle asked. \"They are selling indulgences,\" Entreri explained. \"Selling?\" Athrogate snorted. \"These dirty fools got coin for spending?\" \"What little they have, they spend.\" Athrogate snorted as one particularly skinny man ambled by. \"Ye might be better off in buying a cookie, if ye\u0027re asking me.\" \"The priests will heal their wounds for a fee?\" Jarlaxle asked. \"Minor healing, and temporary at best,\" said Entreri. \"Most who wish for physical heals are wasting their time. They are selling the indulgence of the god Selune. For a few silver pieces, a grieving mother can spare her dead child a tenday in the Fugue, or can facilitate her own way when she dies, if that is her choice.\" \"They are paying for a priest\u0027s promise of such a thing?\" Entreri looked at him and shrugged. Jarlaxle looked back over the throng - and it was indeed a throng of poor souls - then focused on the activity near the temple doors. Lines of dirty peasants waited their turn at the desks that had been set up. One by one, they walked forward and handed over a pittance, and one of the two men at the desk scribbled down a name. \"What a marvelous business,\" the drow said. \"For a few comforting words and a line of text...\" He gave an envious laugh, but to the side, Athrogate spat. Both Entreri and Jarlaxle regarded the dwarf. \"They\u0027re telling them women that turning over their coins\u0027ll help dead kids?\" \"Some,\" said Entreri. \"Orcs,\" muttered the dwarf. \"Worse than orcs.\" He spat again and stormed off. Entreri and Jarlaxle exchanged a confused glance, and Jarlaxle set off after the dwarf. Entreri watched them go, but didn\u0027t follow. He remained at the square for quite a while, and every so often found his eyes drawn to a street entrance across the way, an avenue that wound down toward the docks. A place he knew well. \"The Fugue Plane is a place of torment,\" Devout Gositek assured the nervous little man who stood before his desk. The man\u0027s hands worked feverishly about a tiny coin purse, rolling the dirty bag incessantly. \"I\u0027ve not much,\" he said through his two remaining teeth, crooked and yellow. \"The charity given by the poor is more greatly appreciated, of course,\" Gositek recited, and the devout brothers standing guard behind him both smirked. One even winked at the other, for Gositek had done nothing but complain to them all morning, as soon as the listing had been pegged in the foyer, naming Gositek as one of the indulgence agents every day for the next tenday. He would spend his mornings, collecting coin, and his afternoons offering prayers for the paupers at the smelly graveyard. It was not an envied duty at the Protector\u0027s House. \"It is not the amount of coin,\" Gositek lied, \"but rather the amount of sacrifice that is important for Selune. So the poor are blessed, don\u0027t you see? Your opportunities for freeing your loved ones from the Fugue, and shortening your own visit, are far greater than those of the rich man.\" The dirty old peasant rolled his tiny purse yet again. He licked his lips repeatedly as he fumbled about and extracted a single coin. Then, with a nearly toothless grin that spoke of lechery and deceit, he handed the coin to Devout Gositek\u0027s assistant, who sat beside him to watch over the heavy metal box, a slot in the top to accept the donations. The peasant seemed quite pleased with himself, of course, but Gositek\u0027s glare was uncompromising. \"You hold a purse,\" the devout said. \"It bulges with coin, and you offer a single piece?\" \"My only silver,\" the old peasant wheezed. \"The rest\u0027re but copper, and just a score.\" Gositek just stared at him. \"But my belly\u0027s growling bad,\" the man whined. \"For food or for drink?\" The peasant stammered and sputtered, but couldn\u0027t quite seem to find the words to deny the charge - and indeed, the stench that wafted from him would have made any such denial seem rather foolish. Gositek sat back in his wooden chair and folded his arms in front of him. \"I am disappointed,\" he said. \"But my belly...\" \"I am not disappointed in your lack of charity, good brother,\" Gositek interrupted. \"But in your continuing lack of common sense.\" The peasant stared at him blankly. \"Twice the chance!\" Gositek derided him. \"Twice the opportunity to impress your devotion upon sacred Selune! You can sacrifice greatly, for a pittance, and at the same time better your earthly standing by controlling your impure thoughts. Forsake your coin to Selune, and forego your drink for yourself. Do you not understand?\" The man stuttered and shook his head. \"Each coin buys you double the indulgence and more,\" said Gositek, extending his hand. The peasant slapped the purse into it. Gositek smiled at the man, but it was a cold grin indeed, the smug grin of the cat dominating the mouse before feasting. Slowly and deliberately, Gositek pulled open the purse and dumped the meager contents into his free hand. His eyes flashed as he noted a silver piece among the two dozen coppers, and he looked up from it to the lying peasant, who squirmed and withered under that gaze. \"Record the name,\" Gositek instructed his assistant. \"Bullium,\" the peasant said, and he bobbed his head in a pathetic attempt to bow, and started away. He paused, though, and licked his lips again, staring at the pile of coins in Gositek\u0027s hand. Devout Gositek pulled a few coppers from the pile, staring at the man all the while. He handed the rest to his assistant for the collection box, and started to put the others in the purse. He paused again, however, still staring at the man, and gave half of that pile to his assistant as well. Three coppers went into the purse, which Gositek handed back to the man. But when the peasant grabbed it, Gositek didn\u0027t immediately let go. \"These are a loan, Bullium,\" he said, his tone grave and even. \"Your indulgences are bought - a full year removed from your time on the Fugue Plane. But they are bought for the full contents of your purse, due to your reluctance and your lie about the second piece of silver. You have back three. I expect five returned to Selune to complete the purchase of the indulgence.\" Still stupidly bobbing his head, the peasant grabbed the purse and shuffled away. Beside the wooden chair, Gositek\u0027s assistant chuckled. \"You believe that Knellict and his band haven\u0027t done worse?\" Jarlaxle asked when he at last caught up to the dwarf. They were almost back at their bug-filled shack by then. \"Knellict\u0027s a fool, and an ugly one, too,\" Athrogate grumbled. \"Not much I\u0027m liking there.\" \"But you served him, and the Citadel of Assassins.\" \"Better that than fight the dogs.\" \"So it is all pragmatism with you.\" \"If I knew what the word meant, I\u0027d agree or not,\" said the dwarf. \"What\u0027s that, a religion?\" \"Practicality,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"You do what serves your needs as you see fit.\" \"Don\u0027t everyone?\" Jarlaxle laughed at that. \"To a degree, I expect. But few use that as the guiding principle of their lives.\" \"Maybe that\u0027s all I got left.\" \"Again you speak in riddles,\" said the drow, and when Athrogate scowled at him, Jarlaxle held up his hands defensively. \"I know, I know. You do not wish to speak of it.\" Athrogate snorted. \"Ye ever hear o\u0027 Felbarr, elf?\" \"Was he a dwarf?\" \"Not a he, but a place. Citadel Felbarr.\" Jarlaxle considered the name for a bit, then nodded. \"Dwarven stronghold... east of Mithral Hall.\" \"South o\u0027 Adbar,\" Athrogate confirmed with a nod of his own. \"Was me home and me place, and ne\u0027er did me thoughts expect I\u0027d ever be living anywhere but.\" \"But...?\" \"An orc clan,\" Athrogate explained. \"They come in hard and fast - I\u0027m not even knowin\u0027 how many years ago it\u0027s been. Not enough and too many, if ye get me meaning.\" \"So the orcs sacked your home and now you cannot but wander?\" asked Jarlaxle. \"Surely your clan is about. Scattered perhaps, but...\" \"Nah, me kin\u0027re back in Felbarr. Drove them orcs out, and none too long ago.\" Athrogate\u0027s face grew tight as he said that, Jarlaxle noted, and he decided to pause there and let Athrogate digest it all. He had started the dwarf down a painful road, he knew, but he did not want to press Athrogate too much. To his surprise, and his delight, the dwarf went on without prodding, running his mouth as if he were a river and the drow had just crashed through the beaver dam. \"Ye got young ones?\" Athrogate asked. \"Children?\" Jarlaxle chuckled. \"None that I am aware of.\" \"Bah, but ye\u0027re missing, then,\" said the dwarf. To Jarlaxle\u0027s surprise, there was moistness about Athrogate\u0027s eyes - something he never thought he\u0027d see. \"You had children,\" Jarlaxle surmised, gauging Athrogate\u0027s reaction to his every word before speaking the next. \"They were slain when the orcs invaded.\" \"Good sprites, one and all,\" Athrogate said, and he looked away, past Jarlaxle, as if his eyes were staring into a distant place and distant time. \"And me Gerthalie - what dwarf could ever be thinking he\u0027d be so blessed by Sharindlar to find himself a woman o\u0027 such charms?\" He paused and closed his eyes, and Jarlaxle swallowed hard and wondered if he had been wise in leading Athrogate back to that place. \"Yep, ye got it,\" the dwarf said, eyes popping wide. All hint of tears were gone, replaced by the wildness Jarlaxle had grown used to. \"Orcs took \u0027em all. Watched me littlest one, Drenthro, die. In me arms, he went. Bah, but curse Moradin and all the rest for letting that happen! \"So we were chased out, but them orcs was too stupid to hold the place, and soon enough, they started fighting betwixt themselves. Me king called for a fight, and a fight he got, but meself didn\u0027t go. Surprised them all, don\u0027t ye doubt.\" \"Athrogate doesn\u0027t seem one to shy from a fight.\" \"And never\u0027s he been one. But not that time, elf. Couldn\u0027t go back there.\" He stood with his hands on hips, shaking his head. \"Nothing there for me. They got their Felbarr back, but Felbarr\u0027s not me home no more.\" \"Perhaps now, after all these years....\" \"Nah! Ain\u0027t one o\u0027 them who was alive when the orcs come is still alive now. I\u0027m old, elf, older than ye\u0027d believe, but a dwarf\u0027s memory is older than the dwarf himself. Them boys in Felbarr now wouldn\u0027t have me, and I wouldn\u0027t be wanting them to have me. Dolts. In the first try on getting the place back, more than three hunnerd years ago, Athrogate said no. They called me a coward, elf. Yep, can ye be believing that? Me own kin. Thinkin\u0027 me afraid o\u0027 orcs. I ain\u0027t afraid o\u0027 undead dragons! But to them, Athrogate\u0027s the coward.\" \"Because you would not partake of the retribution?\" Not wanting to break the dwarf\u0027s momentum, Jarlaxle didn\u0027t speak the other part of his question, regarding Athrogate\u0027s recounting of time. Few dwarves lived three centuries, and none, to Jarlaxle\u0027s knowledge, could survive for so long and still retain the vigor and power of one such as Athrogate. Either he was confused with his dates, or there was even more to the creature than Jarlaxle had assumed. \"Because I wouldn\u0027t be going back into that cursed hole,\" Athrogate answered. \"Seen too much o\u0027 me dead kin in every corner and every shadow.\" \"Athrogate died that day the orcs came,\" said Jarlaxle, and the dwarf\u0027s look was one of appreciation, telling the drow that he had spoken the truth. \"But if that was centuries ago, perhaps now....\" \"No!\" the dwarf blurted. \"Ain\u0027t nothing there for me. Ain\u0027t been nothing there for me in a dwarf\u0027s lifetime and more.\" \"So you set out to the east?\" \"East, west, south - didn\u0027t much matter to meself,\" explained Athrogate. \"Just anywhere but there.\" \"You have heard of Mithral Hall, then?\" \"Sure, them Battlehammer boys. Good enough folk. They lost their place a hunnerd years after we lost Felbarr, but I\u0027m hearing they got it back.\" \"Good enough folk?\" asked Jarlaxle, and he filed away the confirmation of the timeline in his thoughts, for indeed, Mithral Hall had been lost to the duergar and the shadow dragon some two centuries before. \"Or too good for Athrogate? Does Athrogate think himself unworthy? Were the barbs of your kin striking true?\" \"Bah!\" the dwarf snorted convincingly. \"But what\u0027s good and what\u0027s bad? And what\u0027s mattering, elf? It\u0027s all a game with them gods laughing at us, ye\u0027re knowing as well as meself\u0027s knowing!\" \"And so you laugh at everything, and hit whatever appears to need a hit.\" \"Hitting it good, too, but ain\u0027t I?\" \"Better than almost any I\u0027ve ever seen.\" Athrogate snorted again. \"Better\u0027n any.\" Jarlaxle received more than a few curious stares as he walked through the streets of the human-dominated city. They were not like the suspicious glares to which he had grown accustomed when he had walked as a drow, however, for there was no hatred, just curiosity, and more than a passing interest in his garments, which appeared far too rich for that poor section of Memnon. In truth, the sum value of Jarlaxle\u0027s garments, just those he wore as he walked across the city, would have made a Waterdhavian lady of court jealous. The drow shook all the distractions from his thoughts, reminding himself that the man he secretly followed was no novice to the ways of the thief. He knew that in all likelihood, Artemis Entreri had already detected the covert pursuit, but the man didn\u0027t show it. Which of course meant nothing. Entreri crossed the square before the temple with determined strides, making a beeline for an avenue on the southern side, a dusty way that sloped down and overlooked the southern harbor. With no cover available, Jarlaxle skirted the edge, and he feared that he\u0027d lose the swift-moving Entreri because of his longer route. As he came around the southern edge of the square, though, he found that Entreri had slowed considerably. As the assassin made his way, Jarlaxle paralleled him, moving with all speed behind the row of shacks. Within a few yards onto the avenue, Jarlaxle noted the visible change that had come over his friend, and never had he seen the sure and confident Entreri looking such. He seemed as if he could barely muster the strength to put one foot in front of the other. The blood had drained from his face, giving him a chalky visage, and made his lips seem even thinner. With hardly an effort, the graceful drow climbed up to the roof of a shack, and shimmied across on his belly to overlook the avenue. A few feet down the road, Entreri had stopped, and stood staring. His hands were by his sides, but they weren\u0027t at the ready near his weapon hilts. Jarlaxle knew it beyond any doubt: Artemis Entreri, as he stood there, was helpless. A novice assassin could have walked up behind him and dispatched him easily. That unsettling thought made Jarlaxle glance around, though he had no reason to suspect that any killers might be nearby. He silently laughed at himself and his irrational fit of nerves, and when he looked back at Entreri, he only then fathomed the absolute strangeness of it all. He rolled over the edge of the roof, dropped lightly to his feet and walked over to stand beside Entreri - who didn\u0027t notice him until the very last moment. Even then, Entreri never bothered to cast a glance Jarlaxle\u0027s way. His eyes remained fixed on a shack down the way, an unremarkable structure of clay and wood, and with the skeleton of a long-rotted awning jutting out in front. Beneath that, a ruined wicker chair was nestled against the shack, beside the open entrance. \"You know this place?\" Entreri didn\u0027t look at him and didn\u0027t answer. His breathing became more labored, however, telling Jarlaxle the truth of it. This had been Entreri\u0027s home, the place of his earliest days.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/road-of-the-patriarch-the-sellswords-3/page-24.html","bookId":2139,"book":{"id":2139,"title":"Road of the Patriarch (The Sellswords #3)","description":"Storyline: The Sellswords #3: Road of the Patriarch Explore the mind of an assassin in R.A.
