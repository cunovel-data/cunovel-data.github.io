{"id":95499,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"A BET HEDGED\\n\\n The half-orc city was on edge. And why not? Word had reached Jarlaxle, and so it had reached Palishchuk as well, that King Gareth was on the march, his formidable army rolling northward across the Vaasan bog to challenge the claim of King Artemis the First. The news had surprised Jarlaxle - who didn\u0027t much like being surprised. He hadn\u0027t thought Gareth would move so decisively, or so boldly. Winter was coming on, which alone could destroy an army in Vaasa, and Gareth was dealing with drow, after all. Gareth had no idea what Jarlaxle had arrayed against him - how could he? And yet he had marched out at once, and in force.\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s respect for the man had multiplied with the news. Rarely had he encountered humans with such confidence and determination.\\n\\n He made certain his boots clicked loudly even on the slick, rain-soaked stones on the side of the hill. He did not want a fight with Wingham, and did not want to startle any of the nervous sentries surrounding the half-orc.\\n\\n Wingham stood near a small fire at the center of the hillock\u0027s flat top, with another, larger half-orc - Olgerkhan, Jarlaxle realized - close beside him. They noticed Jarlaxle\u0027s noisy approach and turned to greet him.\\n\\n As he neared the pair, Jarlaxle recognized the anxiety in their expressions. A bit of fear, a bit of anger, all very clearly revealed in the way they, particularly Olgerkhan, kept glancing around them. Olgerkhan even had his burly arms crossed over his chest, as sure a sign of resistance as could be offered. The differences in racial habits occurred to Jarlaxle at that moment. In Menzoberranzan, when a drow male crossed his arms over his chest, it was a sign of obedience and respect. On the World Above, though, and as with the drow matrons, it was a signal of steadfast defiance, or at least defensiveness.\\n\\n \"Master Wingham,\" he greeted sweetly. \"I am honored that you answered my call.\"\\n\\n \"You knew I would come out,\" Wingham replied, his tone less diplomatic than usual. \"How could I not, with the winds of war stirring about my beloved Palishchuk?\"\\n\\n \"War?\"\\n\\n \"You know that King Gareth has marched.\"\\n\\n \"To celebrate the coronation of King Artemis the First, of course.\"\\n\\n Wingham put on a sour expression that seemed even more exaggerated in the dancing shadows of the small fire.\\n\\n \"Well, we shall learn of his intent soon enough,\" Jarlaxle offered. \"Let us both hope that King Gareth is as wise as his reputation indicates.\"\\n\\n \"Why have you done this?\"\\n\\n \"I serve the king.\"\\n\\n \"You challenge the rightful king,\" Olgerkhan interjected.\\n\\n From under the great brow of his ostentatious hat, Jarlaxle narrowed his red-glowing eyes and thinned his lips, locking Olgerkhan in a stare that surely reminded the burly warrior of his recent adventure beside the drow. Olgerkhan\u0027s crossed arms slipped down to his side and he even stepped back a bit, the aggressiveness melting from his posture. With that one look, Jarlaxle had reminded him of Canthan, to be sure.\\n\\n \"The Bloodstone Lands were opened to you and Artemis Entreri both,\" Wingham said, forcing the drow to look back his way. \"Opportunity awaited you. With respect and song, and the appreciation of all the people, you and Entreri could have had much of what you desire without this confrontation. Would King Gareth have denied you the castle?\"\\n\\n \"I doubt he would approve of the magic it offers,\" the drow replied.\\n\\n \"Even without it! A knight of the order can lay claim to a barony that is as yet unclaimed and untamed. Negotiations with Gareth would have handed the castle to you, and would have earned you the allegiance of Palishchuk, as well, a friendship we were all too willing to extend. Likely, King Gareth would have been grateful to have such worthy warriors helping him to tame the northern wilderness.\"\\n\\n \"And why should we help Gareth extend his claim? Are you so willing to kneel, Wingham?\"\\n\\n Both half-orcs stiffened at the insult, but Wingham didn\u0027t back away. \"Kneel?\"\\n\\n \"If King Gareth tells Wingham to kneel, his knees will soil, no doubt.\"\\n\\n \"It is respect freely given.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle laughed at him. \"It is the obedience of resignation.\"\\n\\n Olgerkhan grumbled something indecipherable, shaking his head, and Jarlaxle wasn\u0027t really surprised that he had confused that one. Wingham, though, just continued to stare, his expression showing clearly that he wasn\u0027t buying the premise one bit.\\n\\n \"Ah well, it is a sad state, is it not?\" Jarlaxle asked. \"It is the way. The way it has been for millennia uncounted, and the way it will be until the end of time.\"\\n\\n \"And you accuse me of resignation?\"\\n\\n \"I accept the truisms of ambition,\" he explained. \"What is resignation to you is relished by me.\" He looked down and pulled his fine piwafwi open a bit to reveal his black leather trousers. \"I do not dirty my fine clothes. Not for any man. Not for any king.\"\\n\\n \"King Gareth will tarnish them with your own blood!\" Olgerkhan promised.\\n\\n Jarlaxle shrugged as if it did not matter.\\n\\n \"You called us out here,\" said Wingham. \"Is there more a point to it than this banter? When you came through Palishchuk, you asked nothing of us, and we were glad to offer you the same.\"\\n\\n \"But now King Gareth marches,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"The situation is changed, of course. Palishchuk finds herself caught between the breaking waves of possibility. To remain between them as they crest is to be crushed by both. It is time to swim, Wingham.\"\\n\\n Olgerkhan stood with his tusky jaw hanging open, a look upon his ugly face so perfectly blank that Jarlaxle nearly laughed out loud. Wingham, though, nodded as he grasped the analogy and its dire implications all too clearly.\\n\\n \"You would have us war with King Gareth, who saved us from the Witch-King and has been a great friend to us?\" the worldly old half-orc asked.\\n\\n Jarlaxle grinned knowingly as he weighed the determination in Wingham\u0027s words - a resolve that he knew he would not weaken however great the threat of Kimmuriel\u0027s drow armies. In fact, it was a resolve that he had counted on since he had learned of Gareth\u0027s bold initiative against the new King of Vaasa.\\n\\n \"Palishchuk will not betray King Gareth,\" Wingham stated, and the drow knew that he was speaking truth.\\n\\n \"We do not forget the time of Zhengyi,\" Wingham went on, and his need to justify his position amused Jarlaxle. \"We remember well the darkness of the Witch-King and the light named Gareth who risked all, who risked his life, his friends, and all of Damara to ensure that we were not out here all alone against a foe we could not defeat.\"\\n\\n \"It is a fine tale,\" the drow agreed.\\n\\n \"We will not betray King Gareth,\" Wingham said again.\\n\\n \"I never said that you should,\" Jarlaxle replied, and Wingham\u0027s steely gaze melted into one of confusion. \"The Army of Bloodstone has marched, with their fine glittering weapons and shining armor. A most impressive sight, to be sure. They come armed and armored, and with wizards and priests aplenty.\\n\\n \"And yet, on the other side, you are faced with the unknown,\" Jarlaxle continued. \"Other than the reputation of my kin and what you so painfully learned of the powers of the Zhengyian castle. I do not make your choice for you, my friend. I only seek to explain to you that the waves are closing and you must swim into one or the other or be destroyed. The time of neutrality has passed. I had not thought it would come to this - not so quickly, at least - but it has, and I would be remiss as a friend if I did not help you to understand.\"\\n\\n \"A friend?\" Olgerkhan roared. \"A friend who brings war to Palishchuk\u0027s door?\"\\n\\n \"My army is not marching,\" Jarlaxle remarked, and at his reference to an army, he noted Wingham\u0027s eyebrows arching just a bit.\\n\\n \"But you come with threats,\" said Olgerkhan.\\n\\n \"Nay, far from it,\" Jarlaxle was quick to reply. \"King Artemis is a man of peace. Look to the south for the winds of war, not to the north.\" He turned from the brutish Olgerkhan to Wingham\u0027s doubting expression, and added, \"It would seem that King Gareth is not a man who shares.\"\\n\\n \"With thieves?\" Wingham dared to ask. \"Who take that which is not theirs? Who lay claim to a kingdom without cause of blood or deed?\"\\n\\n \"Deed?\" Jarlaxle replied as if wounded. \"We conquered the castle, did we not? It was King Artemis who slew the dracolich, after all. Your friend beside you can testify to that, though he lay on the ground helplessly when Artemis struck the fateful blow.\"\\n\\n Olgerkhan bristled and seemed stung by the simple truth, but did not reply.\\n\\n \"So claim the castle, and bargain with King Gareth for a barony,\" Wingham suggested. \"Avert the war, for the sake of all.\"\\n\\n \"A contract that would entail our fealty to Gareth, no doubt,\" the drow said.\\n\\n \"And did you not promise exactly that when you accepted the honors bestowed upon you at King Gareth\u0027s court?\"\\n\\n \"A moment of duress.\"\\n\\n Wingham\u0027s expression soured. \"You have no claim.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle shrugged, again as if it did not matter. \"Perhaps you will be proven correct. Perhaps not. Ultimately, the claim goes to the strongest, does it not? In the final sort of things, I mean. He who remains alive, remains alive to write the histories in a light favorable to him and his cause. Surely as worldly as you are, you know well the histories of the world, Master Wingham. Surely you recognize that armies carrying banners are almost always thieves - until they win.\"\\n\\n Wingham didn\u0027t flinch, and Jarlaxle knew enough about him, about people in general, to understand that he clutched at the rather pitiful - from Jarlaxle\u0027s perspective - ideal of a higher justice, of a universal truism of right and wrong. No man could be more broken, after all, than he who at last must face the truth that his king, his living god, is flawed.\\n\\n \"Look forward, good Wingham,\" Jarlaxle offered. \"The outcome is not known to you, but the result after the battle is indeed. The victor will determine which king rules the land of Vaasa. One wave will overtake the other, and will flatten all the water under its weight. That is the truth facing Palishchuk, however we might feel about it. And in that light, I would caution you to withhold your judgment about who rightfully - and more importantly, who practically - will rule in Vaasa.\"\\n\\n Wingham seemed to blanch for just a moment, but he squared his shoulders and firmed his jaw, his round, flat face tightening with admirable determination. \"Palishchuk will not battle against King Gareth,\" he stated.\\n\\n \"Neutrality, then?\" asked the drow, and he let his expression sour. \"Rarely is the course of the coward rewarded, I fear. But perhaps King Artemis will forgive - \"\\n\\n \"No,\" Wingham interrupted. \"You are right in one thing, Jarlaxle. Palishchuk must not let the events around her bury her under their weight. Not without a fight. We have survived by the sword for all of our history, and so it will be again. Kill me now if you will. Kill us all if you are so thirsty for blood, but understand that if King Gareth\u0027s horn calls out for allegiance, the warriors of Palishchuk will answer that call.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s sudden smile took the half-orc off his guard, and the drow dipped a sincere and respectful bow. \"I never said that you should not,\" Jarlaxle offered, and he turned and walked off into the night.\\n\\n He knew that the half-orc would misinterpret him, would think that his carefree attitude regarding any alliance Palishchuk might choose was a sign of supreme confidence. Jarlaxle loved irony.\\n\\n \"King Gareth has reached Palishchuk,\" Kimmuriel informed Jarlaxle the following afternoon in large and airy foyer of the main keep of Castle D\u0027aerthe. The room had become his audience chamber, in effect, though Artemis Entreri, the man Jarlaxle had named as king, hardly spent any time in the place. He was always out along the walls, in some odd corner with a stone wall sheltering him from the increasingly cold north wind. Jarlaxle understood that his human friend was trying to keep as far away as possible from Kimmuriel and the scores of other dark elves who had come in through the magical gate the psionicist and the wizards of Bregan D\u0027aerthe had created.\\n\\n The king\u0027s absence had not deterred Jarlaxle from playing the games of court fashion, however. Bregan D\u0027aerthe had brought in furnishings that soon adorned every room of the keep. Jarlaxle sat on Entreri\u0027s throne, a purple and blue affair fashioned of a giant mushroom stalk and with the cap used as a fan-like backdrop. Other smaller chairs were set about, including the one directly before the throne, in which sat Kimmuriel.\\n\\n All around them, dark elves tacked tapestries up on the walls, both to defeat the intrusion of stinging daylight and to steal some of the bluster of the biting breeze. Those tapestries showed no murals to the onlookers, however, just fine black cloth, for they were folded in half, their bottom hem tacked up with the top, Kimmuriel\u0027s expression, and those of the other dark elves, reminded Jarlaxle keenly that he was asking quite a bit of his former band in making them come up to such an inhospitable environment.\\n\\n \"He has made good time, given the size of his force,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"It would seem that our little announcement made an impression.\"\\n\\n \"You waved a wounded rothe before a hungry displacer beast,\" Kimmuriel remarked, an old Menzoberranyr saying. \"This human, Gareth, strikes with the surety of a matron mother. Most unusual for his race.\"\\n\\n \"He is a paladin king,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"He is no less fanatical to his god than my mother, Lolth torment her soul eternally, was to the Spider Queen. More so than the dedication one might expect out of fallen House Oblodra, of course.\"\\n\\n Kimmuriel nodded and said, \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle laughed aloud.\\n\\n \"You anticipated this move by Gareth, then,\" Kimmuriel reasoned, and there was an edge to his tone. \"Yet you allowed me to expend great resources in opening the many gates to this abysmal place? The price of the cloth will come out of your fortune, Jarlaxle. Beyond that, I have only a minimal crew operating in Menzoberranzan at the height of the trading season, and almost all of my wizards have been fully engaged in transporting goods, warriors, and fodder for your expedition.\"\\n\\n \"I did not know that he would march, no,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"I suspected that it could come to this, though the speed of Gareth\u0027s response has surprised me, I must admit. I expected this decisive encounter to occur no earlier than next spring, if at all.\"\\n\\n Kimmuriel stroked his smooth, narrow black chin and looked away. After a moment of mulling it over, the psionicist offered a deferential nod to his former master.\\n\\n \"There was great potential gain, and nothing to lose,\" Jarlaxle added.\\n\\n Kimmuriel didn\u0027t disagree. \"Yet again I am reminded of why Bregan D\u0027aerthe has not seen fit to kill you,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Though you have come to see me as an annoyance?\"\\n\\n Kimmuriel smiled - one of the very few expressions Jarlaxle had ever seen on the soulless face of that one. \"This will rank as no more than a minor inconvenience, with perhaps some gain yet to be found. Whenever Jarlaxle has an idea, it seems, Bregan D\u0027aerthe is stretched.\"\\n\\n \"Dice have six sides for a reason, my friend. There is no thrill in surety.\"\\n\\n \"But the win must come from more than one in six,\" said Kimmuriel. \"The Jarlaxle I knew in Menzoberranzan would not wager unless four of the sides brought a profit.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think I have so changed my ways, or my odds?\"\\n\\n \"There was the matter of Calimport.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle conceded that point with a nod.\\n\\n \"But of course, you were caught in the thrall of a mighty artifact,\" said Kimmuriel. \"You cannot be blamed.\"\\n\\n \"You are most generous.\"\\n\\n \"And, as always, Jarlaxle won out in the end.\"\\n\\n \"It is a good habit.\"\\n\\n \"And he chose wisely,\" said Kimmuriel.\\n\\n \"You have a high opinion of yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Little of what I say or think is opinion.\"\\n\\n True enough, Jarlaxle silently conceded. Which was exactly why he had made certain that Rai-guy, the temperamental and unpredictable wizard, was dead and Kimmuriel was still alive and in charge of Bregan D\u0027aerthe during Jarlaxle\u0027s sabbatical.\\n\\n \"And I must admit that your recent scheme has intrigued me,\" Kimmuriel said. \"Though I know not why you insist on even visiting this Lolth-forsaken wilderness.\" He wrapped his arms around him as he spoke and cast a disparaging glance to the side, at a tapestry that lifted out from the wall under the weight of the howling wind rushing in through the cracks in the stone.\\n\\n \"It was a good chance,\" Jarlaxle said.\\n\\n \"It always is, when there is nothing truly to lose.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle sensed the hesitance in his voice, almost as if Kimmuriel was expecting a confrontation, or an unpleasant surprise. The psionicist feared, of course, that Jarlaxle meant to challenge him and order Bregan D\u0027aerthe into battle against King Gareth.\\n\\n \"There are ways around Gareth\u0027s unexpectedly bold move,\" he said to reassure his former, and likely future, lieutenant.\\n\\n \"There are ways through them, as well,\" Kimmuriel replied. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"The point of this wager is not to place too much on the table. I\u0027ll not lose a drow soldier here - and though I do believe that our fodder serve us well by charging into the chewing maw of Gareth\u0027s able army, in even that endeavor we must be stingy. I am not Matron Baenre, obsessed with the conquest of Mithral Hall. I do not seek a fight here - far from it.\"\\n\\n \"Gareth will grant you nothing in a parlay,\" said Kimmuriel. \"You say that he is acting boldly, but no less so than you did when you sent word of the rise of King Artemis.\"\\n\\n \"He will not parlay,\" Jarlaxle agreed, \"because we have nothing to offer to him. We will remedy that, in time.\"\\n\\n \"So what will you say to him now?\"\\n\\n \"Not even farewell,\" Jarlaxle answered with a grin.\\n\\n Kimmuriel nodded with contentment. He glanced again at the waving tapestry, and squeezed his arms just a bit more tightly around himself, but Jarlaxle knew him well enough to realize that he was at peace.\\n\\n A few miles to the south of the castle, on a field outside of Palishchuk, another warrior was anything but at peace. Olwen Forest-friend stalked about the encampment, speaking encouragement to the men and women of the Army of Bloodstone. His forest-green cloak whipped out behind him as he strode briskly from campfire to campfire. His face flushed with passion and eagerness and his legendary war axe gleamed in the firelight. For many years, his favorite weapon had been the bow, but as his agility had decreased with age, he found that running along the fringes of the battlefield no longer suited him. It hadn\u0027t taken long for Olwen to discover the thrill of close combat, nor to perfect the technique.\\n\\n \"We press the walls tomorrow,\" he promised one group of young soldiers, who stared up at him in awe. \"We\u0027ll be home through the Galenas in a matter of days.\"\\n\\n Their eager and grateful responses followed Olwen as he moved on to the next group, dragging a second, far thinner and more graceful figure in his wake.\\n\\n Riordan Parnell was usually charged with maintaining morale. Often in the calm before battle, the bard would entertain with stirring tales of heroic deeds and darkness shattered. But his planned performance had been sidetracked by the overwhelming presence of his ranger friend.\\n\\n He caught up to Olwen before the ranger reached the next group in line, and even dared tug on the man\u0027s sleeve to halt him, or slow him at least. That brought a warning glare, Olwen locking his bright eyes on Riordan\u0027s grasping hand then slowly lifting his gaze to meet that of the bard.\\n\\n \"We have much yet to learn,\" Riordan said as he gently pulled away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve not the time or the desire to read the history of King Artemis.\"\\n\\n \"It is all vague.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re for taking King Gareth\u0027s hard-won land,\" said Olwen. \"They locked themselves in a castle, and we\u0027ll knock that castle down. I see nothing vague here. But don\u0027t you worry, bard. I\u0027ll give you a song or two to write.\" As he made the promise, Olwen brought his war axe over his shoulder and held it firmly before him. With a nod, the ranger turned to go.\\n\\n But Riordan caught him again by the sleeve. \"Olwen,\" he said.\\n\\n The ranger cocked his head to consider the man.\\n\\n \"We do not know all of the details of Mariabronne\u0027s death,\" said Riordan.\\n\\n Olwen\u0027s expression hardened. \"Why are you bringing Mariabronne into this?\"\\n\\n \"Because he fell in that castle, and you know that well. Nothing you do in there tomorrow will change that sad reality.\"\\n\\n Olwen turned to face Riordan squarely, his muscular chest puffed out. He slipped the axe down at the end of one arm, but the movement did little to diminish his imposing posture. \"I march to King Gareth\u0027s call, and not that of a ghost,\" he said, \"to defeat a pretender named Artemis Entreri.\"\\n\\n \"Emelyn has been inside the castle,\" said Riordan. \"And I have spoken with Arrayan and Olgerkhan of Palishchuk, and with Wingham. All of the indications and all of the stories - consistent tales, one and all - do not indicate treachery, but misjudgment, in the death of Mariabronne the Rover. We believe that he was felled by a monster\u0027s blow, and not due in any way to the actions, or even the inactions, of Artemis Entreri or the drow Jarlaxle.\"\\n\\n \"And of course, it wouldn\u0027t be the way of a dark elf to create any mischief.\"\\n\\n It was hard for Riordan to hold his stance against that simple logic.\\n\\n \"Nor for the Witch-King,\" the bard finally managed to counter. \"From all that we have learned, Mariabronne was slain by the enduring and dastardly legacy of Zhengyi.\"\\n\\n \"Speak not that name!\" Olwen ground his teeth and the considerable muscles on his arms twisted as he rolled tight the fingers of his hands, one fist clenched on his right, the knuckles of his other hand whitening as they clamped on the axe handle.\\n\\n Riordan offered a sympathetic look, but Olwen scowled all the more.\\n\\n \"And it might be that the dastardly and enduring legacy of Zhengyi is now in the hands of King Artemis,\" Olwen said and he brought his axe up before him to catch it again in both hands. He pulled it back a bit and slapped it hard into his right mitt for effect. \"I\u0027ve grown weary of that legacy.\"\\n\\n As much as he wanted to argue that point, Riordan Parnell found himself without an answer. Olwen nodded gruffly and spun away, then launched into another rousing cheer as he approached the next group of soldiers in line, all of whom lifted their flagons to the legendary ranger and shouted out in unison, \"For Mariabronne the Rover!\"\\n\\n Riordan watched his friend for a moment, but sensed the approach of another and turned to greet his cousin, Celedon Kierney.\\n\\n \"It is a cheer that will rush us to bloodshed,\" Celedon remarked. \"Olwen will be in no mood for delay when we reach this Castle D\u0027aerthe on the morrow.\"\\n\\n \"I cannot imagine his pain,\" said Riordan. \"To lose a man who was as a son to him.\"\\n\\n \"I wish Gareth had bid him stay in Damara,\" Celedon replied. \"He is as fine a warrior as I have ever known, but he is in no humor for this.\"\\n\\n \"You fear his judgment?\"\\n\\n \"As I would fear yours, or my own, if I had just lost a son. And Mariabronne was exactly that to Olwen. When word reached his ears, he cast about like a lion on the rampage, so the story claims. He went to the druids of Olean\u0027s Grove outside of Kinnery and bade them to reveal the tale in full, and even, it is rumored, to inquire about the possibilities of reincarnation.\"\\n\\n Riordan blanched, but was not really surprised. \"And he was refused, of course.\"\\n\\n \"I do not know,\" said Celedon, \"but I trust that the Great Druid of Olean\u0027s would not entertain such a notion.\"\\n\\n \"So he will assuage his pain with his axe instead,\" said the bard. \"I hope that King Artemis has not grown too fond of his title.\"\\n\\n \"Or his head.\"\\n\\n The next morning, Entreri and Jarlaxle stood on the southern wall of Castle D\u0027aerthe, near the western tower that flanked the castle\u0027s main, south-facing gate. Behind and below them in the courtyard that had once teemed with undead monsters that had risen against their initial incursion into the castle, three hundred goblins and kobolds shifted nervously. None dared speak out, for around them stood merciless dark elf guards bearing long canes and drow priests with their trademark whips, the heads of which were living, biting snakes. Any kobold or goblin who shuffled too far out of line felt the sting of those bites, then squirmed and writhed in horrible, screaming agony on the ground before sweet death finally took it.\\n\\n Entreri and Jarlaxle hardly paid any attention to the spectacle behind them, however, for before them came the Army of Bloodstone. The main infantry marched in tight ranks in the center, flanked by heavy cavalry to either side and with batteries of longbowmen grouped behind the front ranks. The many pennants of Damara, of the Church of Ilmater, and of King Gareth waved in the brisk morning breeze, and the cadence played out on the shields of the warriors, as they had drummed when leaving the Vaasan Gate less than a tenday earlier.\\n\\n A mere fifty yards out from the castle, the procession stopped, and with remarkable precision, they moved into their defensive formations. Shields turned crisply and the front ranks fanned left and right, streaming in thin lines, then thickening again into defensive squares. Wizards danced about as if they were jesters in a court procession, waving their arms and enacting all sorts of wards and shields to deflect and defeat any incoming evocative magic. Just inside the infantry square, the archers formed their ranks, every bow with arrow ready. As the center of the line fully separated, the companions on the wall were treated to a view of the king himself, all splendid in his shining silver armor, and flanked by his powerful friends.\\n\\n \"Do you think they have come for a banquet in my honor?\" Entreri asked.\\n\\n \"That would be my guess. Friar Dugald is dressed in finery, you see, and of course, the king shines as if the sun itself has settled upon him.\"\\n\\n \"And yet that one,\" said Entreri, nodding to indicate the man standing to Gareth\u0027s right, \"seems ill-dressed for anything other than the ruts of a cattle trail.\"\\n\\n \"Master Kane,\" Jarlaxle agreed. \"He truly is an embarrassment. One would think that the King of Damara would find someone to infuse some fashion sense into that fool.\"\\n\\n Entreri smirked, remembering all the days on the road with Jarlaxle, when his companion had set out fine shirts for him. He thought of the night when Jarlaxle had returned with a new belt and scabbard for Charon\u0027s Claw and Entreri\u0027s jeweled dagger. That belt was a magnificent black leather affair, and as fine in design as in appearance, for it held a pair of small throwing knives, fully concealed, within its back length.\\n\\n \"Perhaps Gareth will hire you to instruct the monk,\" Entreri said.\\n\\n Jarlaxle hesitated for a moment before responding, \"He could do worse.\"\\n\\n Six riders and Master Kane came forward from the line. The monk walked in front of Gareth, who was centered by Celedon Kierney and Olwen Forest-friend. Directly behind Gareth rode Riordan Parnell, the bard, strumming a lute and singing. Flanking the bard were Dugald and Emelyn, both quietly spellcasting, building defensive walls.\\n\\n The group closed half the distance to Castle D\u0027aerthe then stopped, and Riordan came out around his king and galloped the short expanse to pull up before the great gates. He noted Jarlaxle and Entreri and trotted his mount off to the side, to sit directly below them.\\n\\n \"Master Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri, Apprentice Knight of the Order\" he began.\\n\\n \"King Artemis,\" Jarlaxle corrected, loudly enough so that Gareth and his friends heard, and bristled - which brought a smile to the drow\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Good subjects - \" Riordan began again.\\n\\n \"We are not.\"\\n\\n The bard stared hard at the obstinate drow. \"You pair of fools, then,\" he said. \"King Gareth Dragonsbane, he who defeated Zhengyi, who cast the Wand of Orcus across the planes of existence, who - \"\\n\\n \"Spare us,\" Jarlaxle interrupted. \"It is cold, and we have heard this litany before - in Gareth\u0027s own court, and not so long ago.\"\\n\\n \"Then your folly should be obvious to you.\"\\n\\n \"Someday I will tell you my own litany of deeds, good bard,\" Jarlaxle called down. \"Then indeed will your friends label you as long-winded.\"\\n\\n \"King Gareth demands audience,\" Riordan called out. \"If you refuse, then war is upon you.\" He looked to the east, and motioned with his right arm. Following that, the pair saw a light cavalry force flanking Castle D\u0027aerthe, and a light infantry taking up defensive positions in its wake.\\n\\n Riordan then motioned west, and the pair saw a similar scene unfolding in that direction.\\n\\n \"To grant audience or to accept a siege,\" Riordan said. \"The choice seems quite obvious.\"\\n\\n \"Why would we not grant free and friendly passage to King Gareth of Damara,\" Jarlaxle asked him, \"our sister kingdom, after all, and no enemy to the throne of Artemis? You need not come to us so formally, and with threats. King Gareth is ever allowed free and welcomed passage through our lands - though if he intends to be accompanied by so large a contingent, who will tramp down our flora and fauna, I do fear that I might have to impose a toll.\"\\n\\n \"A toll?\"\\n\\n \"For smoothing the bog after your passage, of course. Simple upkeep.\"\\n\\n Riordan sat perfectly still for a long while, clearly not amused. \"Will you grant the audience?\"\\n\\n \"Of cour - \" Jarlaxle started to answer, but Entreri grasped his shoulder and shifted in front.\\n\\n \"Tell King Gareth that we do not enjoy the spectacle of an army at our doorstep unannounced,\" Entreri called down to Riordan, and again loud enough for Gareth, and perhaps even some of those in the ranks of the main force, to hear. Keeping his tone polite, and his voice loud, he continued, \"But even so, Gareth may enter my home. We have many tall towers here, as you can see. Please tell Gareth, from me, that he is most welcomed to dive headlong off of any of them.\"\\n\\n Riordan sat a moment, as if digesting the words. He even glanced at one of the towers. \"You are besieged!\" he declared. \"Know that war has come to your door!\" He expertly turned his mount and galloped it back to his group, who were already turning for the main force.\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t the wisest thing you\u0027ve ever done,\" Jarlaxle remarked to his friend.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t this what you wanted?\" Entreri replied. \"War with King Gareth?\"\\n\\n \"Hardly.\"\\n\\n Entreri\u0027s face screwed up with doubt. \"You thought to parlay our good deeds to an independent kingdom for Jarlaxle?\"\\n\\n \"For King Artemis,\" the dark elf corrected.\\n\\n \"You believe that Gareth would allow a drow to rule a kingdom within that which he now calls his own kingdom?\" Entreri went on, disregarding the correction. \"You are a bigger fool than I once thought you - and on that previous occasion, you had the excuse of the lure of Crenshinibon. What is your excuse now beyond abject stupidity?\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle eyed him for a long while, his thin drow lips curling into a smile. He half-turned and looked to the courtyard below, then lifted his hand and clenched his fist.\\n\\n The drivers snapped into action, cracking their whips and setting the fodder into a frenzy. A great crank creaked, chain rattling in protest, and the massive portcullis that blocked Castle D\u0027aerthe\u0027s main gate lifted.\\n\\n \"I was shown two roads,\" Jarlaxle explained to Entreri. \"One would lead me to operate in the shadows, much as I have always done. To find my niche here in the Bloodstone Lands in comfort behind the powers that be - perhaps to serve the Citadel of Assassins, though in a sense far removed from that which Knellict envisioned. Perhaps I would then convince Kimmuriel that this land was worth his efforts, and he and I would lead Bregan D\u0027aerthe to grab at absolute leadership in the underworld of the Bloodstone Lands, similar to what we achieved back in Calimport for a short while, and certainly as we have created in the darkness of Menzoberranzan for nearly two centuries.\" He ended with a laugh, as he finished with, \"It would be worth the effort, perhaps, merely to see Knellict beg for his eternal soul.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle stopped and stood staring at his friend. Beneath them, the gates of the castle swung open and the three hundred goblins and kobolds, the unfortunate shock troops who had only death and pain behind them and a waiting army before them, flooded out onto the field in full charge.\\n\\n \"And the other road?\" Entreri finally, and impatiently, prompted.\\n\\n \"The one we have walked,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"Autonomy. The Kingdom of D\u0027aerthe, presented to King Gareth and the other powers of the Bloodstone Lands, aboveboard and with all legitimacy. A sister and allied kingdom to Damara\u0027s north, living in harmony with Damara, and with Palishchuk.\"\\n\\n \"They would accept a kingdom of drow?\" Entreri made no effort to keep the incredulity out of his voice, which elicited a smirk from Jarlaxle.\\n\\n \"It was worth a try, as I found the other option... boring. Would you disagree?\"\\n\\n \"You wanted it, not I.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle looked at him as if wounded.\\n\\n \"You led our adventures here,\" Entreri said. \"You put us in the service of a pair of dragon sisters, and tricked me to Vaasa, knowing well, all the while, the destination of this road we walk and the inevitable ending.\"\\n\\n \"I could not have known that such an opportunity as Urshula would present itself so readily,\" Jarlaxle argued, but he stopped short and threw up his hands in defeat. \"As you will,\" he said. \"In any event, our time here is at its end.\"\\n\\n \"Beware the ruse!\" Friar Dugald and his clerics shouted out the length of the line, using magic to enhance their shouts.\\n\\n Before the heavy priest, King Gareth and the others coordinated the response to the monstrous charge. Left and right, great longbows bent back and volleys of arrows flew at the goblins and kobolds, the shots spaced properly so that a falling, dying target would not intercept a second arrow.\\n\\n Emelyn the Gray and his wizards held back as the monstrous ranks thinned under the rain of arrows. \"Minor spells only!\" the archmage instructed his forces. \"Keep your power in reserve. They are trying to exhaust us!\"\\n\\n \"And to lessen the burden on their foodstuffs, perhaps,\" Kane quietly added. He was between Gareth and Emelyn when he spoke, and both caught his meaning well. \"They expect a siege, we can conclude, and believe that they can outlast us with winter fast approaching.\"\\n\\n Before them, those monsters who had somehow managed to avoid the arrows came on fast, and were met by a barrage of minor spells. Missiles of wizardly energy - blue, green, and red - shot out and swerved of their own accord, it seemed, unerringly blasting into the targeted creatures. When a pair of ambitious goblins drew too near, Emelyn waved away his charges and stepped forward personally. He touched the tips of his thumbs together, fingers spread wide before him, and spoke a simple command.\\n\\n The goblins, more confused and terrified than bloodthirsty, could not pull up in time, and burst into flame as a wave of fire erupted from the wizard\u0027s hands, fanning out before him.\\n\\n \"Archers fire a volley over the wall!\" Gareth called, and the order echoed down the line. Indeed, with the monstrous ranks so depleted, there was no need for another, point-blank barrage.\\n\\n Out rode Gareth with Celedon, Olwen and Riordan beside him, and, amazingly, the monk Kane sprinted before the charging horses and was the first to engage. He leaped and fell straight out, feet leading, as he neared a goblin and kobold duo, taking the smaller, doglike kobold with a snap kick to the face and slamming the five-foot goblin with a solid hit to the chest.\\n\\n Both shot back as surely as if a horse had kicked them.\\n\\n Kane landed on his back, but moved so quickly and fluidly that many onlookers blinked and shook their heads. For he was up again, in perfect balance, almost as soon as the trailing folds of his dirty robes touched the ground. He stomped on the downed kobold\u0027s neck for good measure, then leaped ahead and to the side, spinning as he landed beside a surprised goblin. The creature took an awkward swing with its mace, one that Kane easily pushed up into the air as he came around. Not breaking the momentum of his turn, the monk snapped his arm back to the right angle and followed through with a jarring elbow, catching the goblin right below the chin and fully crushing its windpipe.\\n\\n \"He does steal all the fun,\" Celedon remarked to Gareth.\\n\\n Gareth began to reply that there were plenty of enemies to be found, but he didn\u0027t bother. The infantry came on hard, and Emelyn\u0027s wizards continued their devastation, and the paladin realized that he would have to be quick if he intended to stain his brilliant sword, Crusader the Holy Avenger, in that initial battle. A quick glance at his friend Kane told him to veer in a different direction if he hoped to find a target.\\n\\n Gasping for breath from the perfectly aimed, driving elbow, the goblin fell away, and before it had even hit the ground, Kane had already engaged another, his hands working furiously in the air before him, like great sweeping fans.\\n\\n And it was all a ruse, designed to get the goblin leaning forward, to get its weapon shifted out just a bit to the side. As soon as that happened, Kane sprang forward, high and turning a somersault as he went. He hooked his leading forearm under the goblin\u0027s chin then planted his shoulder against the goblin\u0027s back as he came around and over. The monk landed on his feet back-to-back with the dizzy goblin, and as he continued forward, he pulled his arm up and over the goblin, forcing its head back and up.\\n\\n Hearing the snap of the creature\u0027s neck bone, Kane quickly released, let the limp thing fall dead to the ground, and charged on.\\n\\n The battle, the slaughter, was over in minutes, with the charge stalled and crushed, the goblins and kobolds lying dead or dying, other than a few who knelt on the ground, their arms up in the air, pleading for their lives.\\n\\n Across the field, the portcullis had already fallen back in place and the gates had swung closed.\\n\\n \"Beware the following wave!\" Dugald and others cried out. \"Beware the gargoyles!\"\\n\\n But there were none. Nothing. The castle sat before them, enormous and deathly quiet. Goblin statues set along the wall leered out, but merely as unmoving, unthreatening stone. No figures moved behind them.\\n\\n Another volley of arrows went over that wall, then a second, but if they hit anything other than the interior walls or the empty ground, no confirming cries of alarm or agony indicated it.\\n\\n \"Hold fire!\" Gareth called as he and the other warriors turned back to reform their previous ranks. The paladin king cast a disparaging glance at the castle of King Artemis the First as he rode, thinking that Kane\u0027s observation had been quite on the mark.\\n\\n But knowing as well that he had neither the patience nor the supplies to support such a siege.\\n\\n Entreri and Jarlaxle heard the arrows cracking on the front door of the main keep, and the assassin was glad that he had thought to close the repaired portal behind him as he had entered.\\n\\n Inside the main room of the ground level, Kimmuriel and several other dark elves waited for the pair, and Entreri couldn\u0027t contain a sour expression at the sight of the hated creatures.\\n\\n \"They will not wait long,\" Kimmuriel told Jarlaxle in the drow tongue, and it bothered Entreri that he still understood that paradoxically lyrical language. How could creatures so vile sound so melodious? \"Gareth will show no patience with the winter winds blowing. As soon as they come to believe that our assault was not merely a diversion for a greater attack, expect that they will come on. They\u0027ve dragged war engines across the miles, and they will not let the catapults remain silent.\"\\n\\n \"We are well prepared, of course.\"\\n\\n \"We are the last,\" Kimmuriel replied. \"The gate is held fast in the lower chamber. It is time to choose, Jarlaxle.\"\\n\\n \"Choose what?\" Entreri asked his companion, using the common tongue of the surface world.\\n\\n That didn\u0027t exclude the fluent Kimmuriel in the least. \"Choose between flight and awakening the full power of the castle,\" he said in the same language, his inflection perfect. He seamlessly went back to the drow tongue as he added to Jarlaxle, \"Will you awaken Urshula?\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle thought on that for a short while. Another volley of arrows streamed into the castle, some cracking against the keep\u0027s doors.\\n\\n \"We might fight a great battle here,\" Jarlaxle said. \"With Urshula and the gargoyles, with the undead who will come to my call, we could inflict great misery on our enemy. And with Bregan D\u0027aerthe\u0027s full power, there is no doubt that we would win the day.\"\\n\\n \"The gain would be temporary, and not worth the price,\" said Kimmuriel. \"We have no reinforcements, yet Damara is a country of King Gareth\u0027s minions, who will not sit idly by. And Gareth likely has many treaties that would bring other nations against us in time.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle looked to Entreri. \"What say you?\"\\n\\n \"I say that I have traveled with an idiot,\" the assassin replied, and Jarlaxle merely laughed.\\n\\n \"Many dead dark elves have said the same,\" Kimmuriel warned, and Entreri shot him a threatening look.\\n\\n But Jarlaxle\u0027s laughter defeated all of the tension. \"It was a good attempt,\" he decided. \"But now that we\u0027ve seen the response, it is time to take our leave of King Gareth and his Bloodstone Lands.\"\\n\\n He motioned for Kimmuriel and the others to lead the way into the tunnels, then waited for Entreri to walk up beside him before following. As they passed the mushroom throne, Jarlaxle tossed a rolled scroll, bound with two strings of gold, onto its seat.\\n\\n Entreri turned as if to retrieve it, but Jarlaxle put a hand on his shoulder and guided him along.\\n\\n They moved through the tunnels, to the room where Mariabronne had fallen to the daemons, then farther down the winding way. Dust fell from the ceiling as the bombardment began above in full. Finally they entered the chamber of Urshula, the scars of the battle bringing that deadly encounter clearly back into Entreri\u0027s thoughts.\\n\\n And reminding him that, in his darkest hour, Jarlaxle had abandoned him.\\n\\n At the back of the huge chamber, beyond the sprawled, bony corpse of the dracolich, its head and neck blackened from the fire of Entreri\u0027s killing trap, an ornate portal, a glowing blue doorway, loomed. While the walls of the chamber could be seen all around its edges, within the frame of the jamb there was only blackness.\\n\\n One after another, the dark elf soldiers of Bregan D\u0027aerthe walked through and disappeared.\\n\\n Soon there were only three left, and Kimmuriel nodded to Jarlaxle then stepped through.\\n\\n \"After you,\" Jarlaxle invited Entreri.\\n\\n \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"Why, in there, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Not that where,\" Entreri growled. \"Where does it lead?\"\\n\\n \"Where does it look like?\"\\n\\n \"A place I do not wish to go.\" As he spoke the words, the truth of them assaulted the human assassin. It was time to leave Gareth and the Bloodstone Lands, so Jarlaxle had said, and that was a sentiment Entreri shared. But to leave with Kimmuriel and the Bregan D\u0027aerthe soldiers implied something entirely different than what he had in mind.\\n\\n \"But the choice has been made,\" said Jarlaxle.\\n\\n \"No. That is the Underdark.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"I will not return there.\"\\n\\n \"You act as if there\u0027s an option to be found.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Entreri said again, staring at the portal as if it was the gateway to the Nine Hells. His memories of Menzoberranzan, of his subjugation to twenty thousand cruel drow, of his understanding that he was no more than iblith, offal, and that anything he might do, anyone he might kill, would be completely irrelevant in altering that recognition of his worth, flooded back to him at that terrible moment.\\n\\n And he thought of Calihye, the first woman he had loved both emotionally and physically, the first woman with whom the bond had become complete. How could he desert her?\\n\\n But what choice did he have?\\n\\n He took a step toward the doorway, and paused as he saw its lines waver, as he saw that the magic was fast diminishing.\\n\\n During that pause came a second wave of memory, of pain, of regret, of anger.\\n\\n The doorway wavered again.\\n\\n \"No,\" said Entreri, and he put his hand on Jarlaxle\u0027s shoulder and guided his companion. \"Go quickly. The magic is fading.\"\\n\\n \"Be not a fool,\" Jarlaxle warned.\\n\\n Entreri sighed and seemed to deflate before the obvious indictment. He looked at Jarlaxle and nodded - just enough to get the drow to relax his guard.\\n\\n In the blink of an eye, Entreri had the red blade of his sword up high, held in both hands over his front shoulder. He gave a growl and went into a sudden spin, bringing the blade around at waist height, an even slice that would have cut Jarlaxle in half.\\n\\n The drow had no way to defend.\\n\\n He offered a sneer as he fell away the only way he could, tumbling more than running into the gate. Jarlaxle winked away just ahead of the cutting blade.\\n\\n Entreri stood there staring at the shimmering extraplanar opening for a few moments longer, but even had its magic not then dissipated, there was no way Artemis Entreri was returning to the Underdark, to Menzoberranzan.\\n\\n Not even to save his life. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/road-of-the-patriarch-the-sellswords-3/page-15.html","bookId":2139,"book":{"id":2139,"title":"Road of the Patriarch (The Sellswords #3)","description":"Storyline: The Sellswords #3: Road of the Patriarch \\n Explore the mind of an assassin in R.A.
