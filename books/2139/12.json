The clouds had broken right before sunset, blown away by a north wind that reached down from the Great Glacier like the cold, dead fingers of the Witch-King himself. That clearing had afforded the townsfolk of Palishchuk a brilliant red sunset, but by the time the stars had begun to twinkle above, the air had grown so cold that all but a few had been driven indoors to their peat-filled hearths.\n Not so for Wingham and Arrayan, though. They stood side by side on Palishchuk\u0027s northern wall, staring out and wondering. Before them on the dark ground, puddles and rivulets shone silver in the moonlight, like the veins of a great sleeping beast, frozen, as was the ground below.\n \"Do you think they will thaw again before the first snows?\" Arrayan asked her much-older uncle.\n \"I have known the freeze to come earlier in the year than this,\" Wingham replied. \"One year, it never actually thawed!\"\n \"1337,\" Arrayan recited, for she had heard the stories of the two-year freeze many times from Wingham. \"The Year of the Wandering Maiden.\"\n The old half-orc smiled at her overly-exasperated tone and the roll of her eyes. \"They say a great white dragon was behind it all,\" Wingham teased, the beginning of one of the many, many folktales that had arisen from that unusually cold summer.\n Arrayan rolled her eyes again, and Wingham laughed heartily and draped his arm around her.\n \"Perhaps this winter will be one of which I will spin yarns in the decades hence,\" the woman said at length, and with enough honest trepidation in her voice to take the grin from Wingham\u0027s wrinkled and weathered face.\n He hugged her closer, and she tucked her arms and pulled her fur-lined cowl tighter around her frosty cheeks.\n \"It has been an eventful year already,\" Wingham replied. \"And one with a happy endin\u0027...\" He paused when she tossed him a fearful look. \"A happy middle,\" he corrected.\n For indeed, the adventure that they all had thought successfully concluded with the defeat of the dracolich had returned to them yet again with the arrival a few days earlier of Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle. The pair had come riding in to Palishchuk on hellish steeds, coal black and with hooves pounding fire into the frozen tundra.\n They had been welcomed warmly, as heroes, of course. They had earned the accolades for their work beside Arrayan and Olgerkhan, and they had been granted free room and board in Palishchuk at any time for the remainder of their lives. Indeed, when the pair had first arrived, several of the townsfolk had argued loudly over who would have the honor of boarding them for their stay.\n How quickly things had changed from that initial meeting.\n For the pair would not stay. They were merely passing through on their way to the conquered castle - Castle D\u0027aerthe, Jarlaxle had named it. Their castle, the seat of their power, hub of the kingdom they planned to rule.\n The kingdom they planned to rule.\n A kingdom that by definition would surround or encompass Palishchuk.\n There had been no answers forthcoming to the multitude of questions shot back at the surprising pair by the leaders of Palishchuk. Jarlaxle had nodded, and merely added, \"We hold nothing but respect and admiration for Palishchuk, and we consider you great friends in this wondrous adventure upon which we now embark.\"\n Then they had gone, the pair of them back on their impressive steeds, thundering out of Palishchuk\u0027s northern gate, and while some of the leaders had called for the pair to be detained and questioned, none had the courage to stand before them.\n But they had returned, and the city\u0027s scouts had been filtering in and out with reports of shadowy figures moving about the castle\u0027s formidable walls, and of gargoyles taking flight only to crouch at another spot along the parapets and towers of the magical construct.\n Arrayan glanced down the length of the wall, where a doubled number of guardsmen stood ready and nervous.\n \"Do you think they will come?\" she asked.\n \"They?\"\n \"The gargoyles. I have heard the tales of Palishchuk\u0027s fight while I was battling within the castle walls. Do you think this night, or tomorrow\u0027s, will bring another struggle to the city?\"\n Wingham looked back to the north and shrugged, but was shaking his head by the time his shoulders slumped back down. \"The scouts have claimed sightings of gargoyles in the dark of night,\" he said. \"I can imagine their fear as they crouched outside of that formidable place.\"\n Arrayan looked at him at the same time he was turning to her.\n \"Even if it is true and Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri have brought the castle back to life, I fear no attack from them,\" Wingham went on. \"Why would they have bothered to stop in Palishchuk to proclaim their friendship if they meant to attack us?\"\n \"To put us off our guard?\"\n With a nod, Wingham directed her attention back to the doubled sentries lining the wall. \"Our guard would have been nonexistent had they just ridden by the city, to animate the castle and attack while we played under the delusion that our battle was successfully completed, I expect.\"\n Arrayan spent a moment digesting that as she looked back to the north. She smiled when she met Wingham\u0027s gaze yet again. \"Are you not curious, though?\"\n \"More than you are,\" the old barker replied with a mischievous grin. \"Fetch Olgerkhan, will you? I would appreciate his sturdy companionship as we venture to the home of our former allies.\"\n \"Former?\"\n \"And present, we must believe.\"\n \"And hope.\"\n Wingham smiled. \"Castle D\u0027aerthe,\" he mumbled as Arrayan started for the ladder. Even more quietly, he added, \"It can only portend trouble.\"\n Two sets of eyes looked back in the direction of Wingham and Arrayan, from far away and with neither pair aware of the other. On the southern wall of the magical castle north of Palishchuk, Jarlaxle and Entreri did not huddle under heavy woolen cloaks - nothing that mundane for Jarlaxle, of course, who had taken out a small red globe, placed it on the stone between them, and uttered a command word. The stone glowed red, brightly for a moment, then dimmed and began to radiate heat comparable to that of a small campfire. The northern wind rushing off the Great Glacier still bit at them, for they were thirty feet up atop the wall, but the mediating warmth sufficed.\n \"What now?\" Entreri asked, after they had been up there for many minutes, staring in silence across the miles to the dim glow of Palishchuk\u0027s nighttime fires.\n \"You started the fight,\" Jarlaxle replied.\n \"We ran from the Citadel. Better that we fight them in the streets of Heliogabalus, one alley at a time.\"\n \"It is a bigger fight than just the Citadel,\" Jarlaxle calmly explained - and indeed, it was that tone, so self-assured and reasonable, that had Entreri on his edge. Whenever Jarlaxle got comfortable about something, Entreri knew from experience, big trouble was usually brewing.\n \"We have stirred the nest,\" Entreri agreed, \"between the king and Knellict. So now we must choose a side.\"\n \"And you would select?\"\n \"Gareth.\"\n \"Conscience?\"\n \"Practicality,\" Entreri countered. \"If there is to be an open war between the Citadel of Assassins and King Gareth, Gareth will win. I\u0027ve seen it before, in Calimport, and you\u0027ve known this struggle in Menzoberranzan. When a guild pricks too sharply at the side of the open powers, they retaliate.\"\n \"So you believe that King Gareth will obliterate Knellict and the Citadel of Assassins? He will wipe them from the Bloodstone Lands?\"\n Entreri mulled that over for a few moments, then shook his head. \"No. He will drive them from the streets and back into their remote hideouts. Some of those will likely fall, as well. Some of the Citadel\u0027s leaders will be killed or imprisoned. But Gareth will never truly be rid of them. That is never the way.\" He paused and considered his own words, then chortled, \"He wouldn\u0027t wish to be completely rid of them.\"\n Jarlaxle watched him out of the corner of his eyes, and Entreri noted the little grin spreading on the drow\u0027s face. \"King Gareth is a paladin,\" the drow reminded. \"Do you doubt his sincerity?\"\n \"Does it matter? Having the Citadel of Assassins lurking in the shadows is good for Gareth and his friends, a reminder to the people of Damara of the alternative to their hero king.\n \"He is no Ellery, perhaps, in that he won\u0027t deal with the Citadel, but he uses them all the same. It is the nature of power.\"\n \"You have a cynical view of the world.\"\n \"It is well earned, I assure you. And it is accurate.\"\n \"I did not say it was not.\"\n \"Yet you seem to think Gareth above reproach because he is a paladin.\"\n \"No, I think him predictable because he is guided more by principle - ill-reasoned or not - than by pragmatism. Gareth\u0027s end plan is always known, is it not? He may be served well by the Citadel, but he is likely too blinded by dogma to see that truth.\"\n \"You still have not answered my question,\" said Entreri. \"What now for us?\"\n \"It seems obvious.\"\n \"Enlighten me.\"\n \"Always.\"\n \"Now.\"\n Jarlaxle gave an exasperated sigh. \"We declare our independence from King Gareth, of course,\" he replied.\n Far below the pair, very near the room where the bones of Urshula the dracolich lay, Kimmuriel Oblodra conferred with his drow lieutenants, laying out plans for the defense of the castle, for assaults from the walls and gates, and most important of all, for orderly and swift retreat back to that very chamber. Not far from the drow, a magical portal glowed a light blue. Through it came more drow warriors of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, driving mobs of goblins, kobolds, and orcs bearing supplies, armaments, and furniture, fashioned mostly of sturdy Underdark mushrooms.\n A continual line passed through the gate, and other drow went through in the other direction, back to the corresponding magical portal set in the maze of tunnels along the great Clawrift in Menzoberranzan, the complex that Bregan D\u0027aerthe called home.\n \"The sooner we are gone, the better,\" one of Kimmuriel\u0027s lieutenants remarked, and though others nodded their accord, Kimmuriel flashed the drow a dangerous look.\n \"Do say,\" the psionicist prompted.\n \"This place is uneasy,\" the drow replied. \"It teems with an energy that I do not recognize.\"\n \"And thus, an energy you fear?\"\n \"The portcullis on the front gate... grows,\" another soldier added. \"It was damaged by unwanted entry, and now it repairs itself of its own accord. This is no inert construction, but a magical, living creature.\"\n \"Is this place any different than the towers of the Crystal Shard?\" said the first lieutenant.\n \"Is Jarlaxle, you mean,\" Kimmuriel remarked, and neither of the pair disavowed him of that notion.\n \"I do not know,\" the psionicist answered honestly. \"Though I believe that Jarlaxle is acting of his own volition and wisdom here. If I did not, I would not have marched us to this wretched place.\" He led their gazes to the portal, and another group of goblins trudging through, bearing several rolled tapestries and carpets. \"He recognizes equivocation...\"\n \"An easy egress,\" one of the others remarked.\n Beside them, a quartet of goblins tripped and stumbled, spilling a mushroom-fashioned hutch across the floor. Drow drivers stepped up, cracking their whips against the flesh of the miserable creatures, who all fell to their hands and knees to try to collect the broken pieces.\n The soldiers beside Kimmuriel nodded, recognizing the truth of it all, that they weren\u0027t bringing anything of real value to the castle, just utilitarian furniture and simple dressings.\n And fodder, of course. Goblins, orcs, and kobolds, all as easily expendable to the dark elves as a cheap piece of mushroom furniture.\n \"Our independence?\" Artemis Entreri answered after many stunned moments. \"Could we not just leave the Bloodstone Lands?\"\n \"And take this castle with us?\"\n Entreri went silent, finally understanding the drow\u0027s machinations. \"You were serious when you warned Palishchuk to remain neutral?\"\n \"We must pick a name for our kingdom,\" Jarlaxle said, ignoring the question and confirming it all at once. \"Have you any suggestions?\"\n Entreri looked at him with complete incredulity.\n \"The gauntlet is down,\" Jarlaxle said. \"You threw it at Knellict\u0027s feet when you did not kill the merchant.\"\n Entreri looked away again, his lips going very tight.\n \"Was the man not worthy of your blade? Or was he not deserving of it?\"\n Entreri turned a hateful gaze the drow\u0027s way.\n \"I thought as much,\" Jarlaxle said. \"You might have found a better moment to discover your conscience. But it does not matter, for it had to come to this in any event. Better now, I suppose, than when Knellict grew a better appreciation for what has truly come against him.\"\n \"And what might that be? A pair of impetuous fools, a small army of gargoyles and an undead dragon we can hardly control?\"\n \"Look more closely,\" Jarlaxle said slyly, and he directed Entreri\u0027s attention to the watchtower off to the right of the gatehouse. A slender form moved there, silent as, and seeming no more substantial than, the shadows.\n A drow.\n Entreri snapped his gaze back over Jarlaxle. \"Kimmuriel?\"\n \"Bregan D\u0027aerthe,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"And ample slave fodder arrive regularly through magical gates. If you wish to start a war, my friend, you need an army.\"\n \"Start a war?\"\n \"I had hoped that we could do this more easily, and more by proxy,\" Jarlaxle admitted. \"I had hoped that we could get the two beasts - the king and the Grandfather of Assassins - to devour each other. You played our hand too quickly.\"\n \"And now you wish to start a war?\"\n \"No,\" Jarlaxle corrected. \"But it is not beyond the realm of possibility. If Knellict comes, we will drive him back.\"\n \"With the drow and Urshula and all the rest?\"\n \"With everything at our disposal. Knellict is not one to be bargained with.\"\n \"Let us just leave.\"\n That seemed to catch Jarlaxle off guard. He leaned on the wall, staring out at the south and the darkness that was interrupted only by the glow of a few fires burning in Palishchuk and the starlight. \"No,\" he finally answered.\n \"There is a big world out there, where we might get lost - sufficiently so. It would seem that we have worn out our welcome.\"\n \"With Knellict.\"\n \"That is enough.\"\n Jarlaxle shook his head. \"We can leave whenever we wish, thanks to Kimmuriel. As of now, I do not desire to go. I like it here.\" He paused there and let his smile fall over Entreri until the man finally acknowledged it - with a derisive snort, of course. \"Consider Calihye, my friend. Remind yourself that some things are worth fighting for.\"\n \"We make a stand where we need not. Calihye is not a plot of ground or a magically created castle. There is nothing to stop her from coming with us. Your analogy cannot hold.\"\n Jarlaxle nodded, conceding the point. His smile told Entreri, however, that the point was moot. Jarlaxle liked it there; for the drow, apparently, that was enough.\n Entreri looked over to the corner tower again, and though he saw no movement there, he knew that Jarlaxle\u0027s friends had come. He thought of Calimport and the catastrophe Bregan D\u0027aerthe had wrought there, eliminating guilds that had stood for decades and altering the balance of power within the city with relative ease.\n Would the same occur in the Bloodstone Lands?\n Or was Jarlaxle\u0027s ambition even more ominous? A kingdom to rival Damara. A kingdom built on an army of drow and slave fodder, on undead servants and animated gargoyles, and forged in a bargain with a dracolich?\n Entreri shuddered, and it was not from the cold northern wind.\n \"A gargoyle,\" Arrayan remarked, nodding toward the dark castle wall where a humanoid, winged creature had taken flight, moving from one guard tower to another. \"The castle is alive.\"\n \"Curse them,\" Olgerkhan grunted, while Wingham only sighed.\n \"We should have known better than to trust a drow,\" Arrayan said.\n \"How often have I heard those words about our own half-orc race,\" Wingham was quick to answer, drawing surprised looks from both of his companions.\n \"The castle is alive,\" Olgerkhan reiterated.\n \"And Palishchuk has not been threatened,\" said Wingham. \"As Jarlaxle promised.\"\n \"You would trust the word of a drow?\" Olgerkhan asked.\n Wingham\u0027s answer came in the form of a shrug and the simple reply of, \"Have we a choice?\"\n \"We beat the castle once,\" Olgerkhan growled in defiance, and he held a clenched fist up before him, the muscles in his arm bulging and knotting.\n \"You beat an unthinking animation,\" Wingham corrected. \"This time, it has a brain.\"\n \"And one who has marched several steps ahead of us,\" Arrayan agreed. \"Even inside, when they saved me from Canthan. When they brought you back to life through the vampirism of Entreri\u0027s dagger,\" she said to Olgerkhan, stealing much of his bluster. \"Jarlaxle understood it all where I, and the wizard Canthan, did not. I wonder if even then his goal was not to destroy the construct, but to control it.\"\n \"His castle stands here, alive and strong, and King Gareth\u0027s is to the south,\" Wingham remarked. \"And Palishchuk is in between them.\"\n \"Again,\" Arrayan said with great resignation, \"as it was with Zhengyi.\"\n \"I am no longer surprised by the clumsiness of the surface races,\" Kimmuriel Oblodra said to Jarlaxle. The two were very near the same spot on the wall where Jarlaxle had held his conversation with Artemis Entreri a short while before, and as with then, they looked out to the south. Not to Palishchuk, though, for Kimmuriel had directed Jarlaxle\u0027s attention to a copse of leafless trees a bit to the right, in the shadow of a small hill. Neither drow could make out the forms that Kimmuriel had promised his former leader lurked in there, a trio of half-orcs.\n \"There is a wizard among them,\" Kimmuriel said. \"She is of little consequence and no real power.\"\n \"Arrayan,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"She has her uses, and is comfort to weary eyes - as much as any with orc heritage could be, of course.\"\n \"Your promises did not hold much sway in the town, it seems.\"\n \"They are being careful, and who can blame them?\"\n \"They will know that the construct is awakening,\" said Kimmuriel. \"The gargoyles fly about.\"\n Jarlaxle nodded, making it obvious that they did so at his behest. \"Have they seen any of your scouts? Are they aware of any drow about other than myself?\"\n Kimmuriel scoffed at the ridiculous notion. Drow were not seen by such pitiful creatures as these unless they wanted to be seen.\n \"Show them, then,\" Jarlaxle instructed.\n Kimmuriel stared hard at him, to which Jarlaxle nodded a confirmation.\n \"You would use terror to hold them at bay?\" Kimmuriel asked. \"That speaks of diplomatic weakness.\"\n \"Palishchuk will have to choose eventually.\"\n \"Between Jarlaxle - \"\n \"King Artemis the First,\" Jarlaxle corrected with a grin.\n \"Between Jarlaxle,\" the stubborn Kimmuriel insisted, \"and King Gareth?\"\n \"I surely hope not - not for a long while, at least,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"I doubt that Gareth will be quick to charge to the north, but the Citadel of Assassins is likely already infiltrating Palishchuk. It is my hope that the half-orcs will think it unwise to provide aid to Knellict\u0027s vile crew.\"\n \"Because they will be more fearful of Jarlaxle and the dark elves?\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \"Your fear tactics will work against you when King Gareth comes calling,\" Kimmuriel warned, and he knew that he had struck a chord there by Jarlaxle\u0027s long pause.\n \"By that time, I hope to have Knellict long dispatched,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"We can then build a measure of trust to the half-orcs. Enough trust coupled with the fear that will force them to keep King Gareth at arm\u0027s length.\"\n Kimmuriel was shaking his head as he looked back to the southwest.\n \"Show them,\" Jarlaxle said to him. \"And allow them to go on their way.\"\n Kimmuriel wasn\u0027t about to question Jarlaxle just then, for his words to his doubting lieutenants just a short while before had been spoken sincerely. It was Jarlaxle\u0027s scheme, and in truth, Kimmuriel, for all of his growing confidence, recognized that standing beside him was a drow who had survived the intrigue of Menzoberranzan and elsewhere for several centuries. With the notable exception of the near-disaster in Calimport, had Jarlaxle\u0027s schemes ever failed?\n And that near-disaster, Kimmuriel pointedly reminded himself, had been caused in no small part by the corrupting influence of the artifact known as Crenshinibon.\n The psionicist could not manage a reassuring expression to his companion, though. For all of the history of successful manipulations Jarlaxle brought to the table, Kimmuriel had familiarized himself quite extensively with the recent events in the region known as the Bloodstone Lands, and had come to understand well the power King Gareth Dragonsbane could wield.\n Jarlaxle\u0027s own actions showed him clearly that he was not alone in his fears, he realized. Jarlaxle had not reclaimed control of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, though he had bade Kimmuriel to garner all of their resources. For all of his outward confidence, Jarlaxle was hedging his bets by allowing Kimmuriel complete control. He was protecting himself from that very confidence.\n Understanding the compliment that Jarlaxle was once again paying to him, Kimmuriel offered a salute before going on his way. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/road-of-the-patriarch-the-sellswords-3/page-12.html","bookId":2139,"book":{"id":2139,"title":"Road of the Patriarch (The Sellswords #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Sellswords #3: Road of the Patriarch \n Explore the mind of an assassin in R.A.
