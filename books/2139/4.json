{"id":95488,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"THE ROAD TO BLOODSTONE\\n\\n The companions could not have appeared more disparate. Jarlaxle rode a tall, lean mare, seventeen hands at least. He was dressed all in finery - silk clothing, a great sweeping cloak, and a huge wide-brimmed purple hat, adorned with the gigantic feather of a diatryma bird. He seemed impervious to the dust of the road, as not a smudge or stain showed on his clothing. He was lean and graceful, sitting perfectly upright, appearing as a noble of great stature and breeding. One could easily imagine him as a prince of drow society, a dark emissary skilled in the ways of diplomacy.\\n\\n The dwarf riding next to him, on a donkey no less, could never have been accused of such delicacies. Stocky and brutish, many might have confused Athrogate for the source of the road\u0027s dirt. To the obvious irritation of the poor donkey, he wore a suit of armor, part leather, part plated, and covered with a myriad of buckles and straps. He hadn\u0027t bothered with a saddle, but just clamped his legs tightly around the unfortunate beast, which poked along stiff-legged, giving the dwarf a jolting and popping ride. His weapons, a pair of gray, glassteel morningstars, rose up in an X from his back, their spiked heads bouncing with each of the donkey\u0027s jarring steps.\\n\\n And of course, Athrogate\u0027s considerable hair, too, was so unlike the cleanshaven drow, whose head shone smooth and black beneath the rim of his great hat - and indeed, those occasions when Jarlaxle lifted the hat showed him to be completely devoid of hair on his head, save a pair of thin, angled eyebrows. Athrogate wore his mane like a proud lion. Black hair, lots of it, lifted wildly from his head in every direction, blending with an abundance coming out of his ears, and he had once more braided his great beard, with its customary part in the middle, each braid secured with ties that featured blue gemstones.\\n\\n \"Ah, but ain\u0027t we the big heroes,\" Athrogate said to his traveling companion.\\n\\n Ahead of them on the trail rode Artemis Entreri and Calihye, with a couple of soldiers leading the way. Behind the drow and the dwarf came more soldiers, leading a caisson that held the body of Commander Ellery, the young and once-promising knight, niece of King Gareth Dragonsbane and an officer in the Army of Bloodstone. The people of the Bloodstone Lands mourned Ellery\u0027s loss. The heroine had been cut down in the strange castle that had appeared in the bog lands of Vaasa, north of the half-orc city of Palishchuk.\\n\\n Jarlaxle was glad that no one other than he and Entreri knew the truth of her death, that it had come at Entreri\u0027s hand during a fight between Ellery and Jarlaxle.\\n\\n \"Heroes, indeed,\" the drow finally replied. \"I prophesied as much to you when I pulled you out of that hole. Holding fast to your anger about Canthan\u0027s unfortunate demise would have been a rather silly attitude when so much glory was there for our taking.\"\\n\\n \"Who said I was angry?\" Athrogate huffed. \"Just didn\u0027t want to have to eat the fool.\"\\n\\n \"It was more than that, good dwarf.\"\\n\\n \"Bwahaha!\"\\n\\n \"Your allegiances were torn - legitimately so,\" Jarlaxle said, and glanced at Athrogate to try to measure the dwarf\u0027s reaction.\\n\\n Athrogate had been engaged in a fight to the death with Entreri when Jarlaxle had intervened. Using one of his many, many magical items, Jarlaxle had opened a ten-foot-deep magical hole at the surprised dwarf\u0027s feet, into which Athrogate had tumbled. Grumbling and complaining, the helplessly trapped Athrogate had been unwilling to join in and see the error of his ways - until Entreri had dropped the corpse of the dwarf\u0027s wizard associate into the hole beside him.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re not for knowing Knellict the way I\u0027m for knowing Knellict,\" Athrogate leaned over and whispered. Again Jarlaxle was taken aback by the tremor that came into the normally fearless dwarf\u0027s voice when he mentioned the name of Knellict, who at that time was either the primary assistant of Timoshenko, the Grandfather of Assassins in the prominent murderers\u0027 guild in Damara, or - so hinted the whispers - who had assumed the mantle of grandfather himself. \"Seen him turn a dwarf into a frog once, then another into a hungry snake,\" Athrogate went on, and he sat straight again and shuddered. \"Halfway through dinner, he turned \u0027em back.\"\\n\\n The level of cruelty certainly didn\u0027t surprise or unnerve Jarlaxle, third son of House Baenre, who, as a newborn, had been stabbed in the chest by his own mother - a sacrifice to the vile goddess who ruled the world of the drow. Jarlaxle had spent centuries in Menzoberranzan, living and breathing the unending cruelty and viciousness of his malevolent race. Nothing Athrogate had told him, nothing Athrogate could tell him, could elicit a shudder such as the one the dwarf had offered during his recounting.\\n\\n And Jarlaxle had suspected as much about Knellict, anyway. Knellict was the darker background in an organization built in the shadows, the dreaded Citadel of Assassins. Jarlaxle knew from his own experience as leader of the mercenary band Bregan D\u0027aerthe, that in such organizations the leader - in the case of the citadel, reputedly Timoshenko - played a softer, more politic hand, while his lieutenants, such as Knellict, were quite often the barbarians behind the throne, the vicious enforcers who made followers and potential enemies alike take some measure of hope in the leader\u0027s infrequent but not unknown smiles.\\n\\n On top of that, Knellict was a wizard, and Jarlaxle had always found that type to be capable of the greatest cruelties. Perhaps it was their superior intellect that so divorced them from the visceral agony resulting from their actions. Perhaps it was the arrogance that often accompanied such great intellect that so allowed them to disassociate themselves from the common folk, as an ordinary man might step on a cockroach without remorse. Or perhaps it was because wizards usually attacked from a distance. Unlike the warrior, whose killing strike often soaked his arm in the warmth of his enemy\u0027s blood, a wizard might throw a spell from afar and watch its destructive effects divorced from their immediacy.\\n\\n They were a complicated and dangerous bunch, spellcasters, aloof and ultimately cruel. In Bregan D\u0027aerthe, Jarlaxle had often elevated wizards to lieutenant or higher posts for just those reasons.\\n\\n And the dwarf beside him, the drow reminded himself, was not to be taken lightly either. For all his jovial and foolish banter, Athrogate remained a potentially dangerous and capable enemy, one who had put Artemis Entreri back on his heels in their battle within the Zhengyian construct. Athrogate was as pure an instrument of destruction as any assassin\u0027s guild - or any army, for that matter - could ever hope to employ. He had gained quite the reputation at the Vaasan Gate, bringing in the ears of bounty creatures by the sackload. And for all his passion, his bluster, and his raucousness, Jarlaxle saw a significant gulf in Athrogate\u0027s personality. However Athrogate might befriend Jarlaxle and Entreri, if the order came from on high to kill them, Athrogate would likely shrug and take on the task. It would be just business for him, much as it had been for Entreri for all those years he served the Pashas in Calimport.\\n\\n \"Is yer friend understandin\u0027 the honor he\u0027s gettin\u0027?\" Athrogate asked, nodding his chin toward Entreri. \"Knight of the Order - ain\u0027t no small thing in the Bloodstone Lands these days, what with Gareth bein\u0027 the king and all.\"\\n\\n \"I am sure he does not, and will not,\" the drow replied, and he gave a little laugh as he considered Entreri\u0027s obstinacy. With the exception of the two half-orcs, Arrayan and Olgerkhan, who had remained in Palishchuk, the survivors of the battle with Urshula the dracolich and the other minions of the magically animated castle were being hailed as heroes in Bloodstone Village on the morrow. Even Calihye, who had not gone into the castle, and Davis Eng, a soldier of the Army of Bloodstone who had been wounded on the road out from the Vaasan Gate, were to be honored. Those two and Athrogate would be recognized as Citizens of Good Standing in Damara and Vaasa, a title that would grant them discounts from merchants, free lodging in any inn, and - most important for Athrogate - free first drinks in any tavern. Jarlaxle could easily picture the dwarf running from tavern to tavern in Heliogabalus, swilling down a multitude of first drinks.\\n\\n For his part, recognized for a more important role, Jarlaxle was to be given a slightly higher title, that of Bloodstone Hero, which conveyed all the benefits of the lower medal, and also allowed Jarlaxle free passage throughout the burgeoning kingdom and granted the guarantee of Gareth\u0027s protection wherever it might be needed. While Jarlaxle agreed that his own role in the victory had been paramount, he had been a bit perplexed at first by the discrepancies in the honors, particularly between himself and Athrogate, who had battled the dracolich valiantly. At first he had presumed it to be the result of Athrogate\u0027s rather extensive and less-than-stellar public record, but after hearing of the honors to be given to Entreri, the actual slayer of the beast, Jarlaxle had come to see the truth of it. These degrees of honor had been quietly suggested, whispered through appropriate and legitimate channels, by Knellict and the Citadel of Assassins. Knellict had already explained to Jarlaxle that his value to the guild would, in no small part, be due to his ability to fill the void left by the death of Commander Ellery, distant niece of King Gareth, who was also tied in with the citadel.\\n\\n For Entreri, that one blow - luring the beast to thrust its head under the trap he had set in a side tunnel off the main lair - had changed the world. Entreri was the hero of the day, and accordingly, King Gareth would bestow upon him the title of Apprentice Knight of the Order.\\n\\n Artemis Entreri, a knight in a paladin king\u0027s army... it was more than Jarlaxle could take, and he burst out laughing.\\n\\n \"Bwahaha!\" Athrogate joined in, though he hadn\u0027t any idea what had set the drow off. Apparently catching on to that reality, Athrogate bit off his chortle and said, \"So what\u0027s got ye titterin\u0027, coalskin?\"\\n\\n Low clouds in the west dulled the late afternoon sun, and the cool breeze comfortably tickled Master Kane. He sat cross-legged, hands on his thighs with his palms facing up. He kept his eyes closed, allowing his mind to focus inward as he consciously relaxed his body, using his rhythmic breathing as a cadence for his complete concentration.\\n\\n One would not normally fly upon a magical carpet with his eyes closed, but Kane, former Grandmaster of Flowers at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, was not concerned by trivial matters such as steering the thing. Every so often, he opened his eyes and adjusted accordingly, but he figured that unless a dragon happened to be soaring through the skies over Bloodstone Valley, he was safe enough.\\n\\n So perfect was his mental count that he opened his eyes just as Bloodstone Village came into view far below him. He spotted all of the major buildings, of course, but they didn\u0027t impress him, not even the grand palace of his dear friend, Gareth Dragonsbane.\\n\\n Nothing man-made could hold much of an impact over Kane, who had known the decorated corridors of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, but the White Tree....\\n\\n As soon as the monk spotted it in the grand garden on the shores of Lake Midai his heart filled with serenity and the contentment that could only come from accepting oneself as a part of something larger, of something eternal. The seed for that tree, the Tree-Gem, had been given to Kane and his fellow heroes by Bahamut, the platinum dragon, the greatest wyrm of all, as a tribute to their efforts in defeating the Witch-King and his demonic associates and destroying the Wand of Orcus.\\n\\n The White Tree stood as a symbol of that victory, and more than that, it served as a magical ward preventing creatures of the Abyssal planes from walking across the Bloodstone Lands. That tree showed Kane that their efforts had created not just a temporary victory, but a lasting blessing on the land he called home.\\n\\n As he looked upon it, Kane reached to his side and picked up his walking stick, which had been fashioned from a branch of that magical tree. Smooth as polished stone and as white as the day he had taken it from the tree, for the dirt of no road could gray it, the jo staff was as hard and solid as adamantine, and in Kane\u0027s skilled hands, it could shatter stone.\\n\\n With a thought, Kane veered the magic carpet toward the tree, gliding in to a smooth landing on the ground before its trunk. He stayed in his seated position, legs crossed, hands on his upturned thighs, the jo stick laid across his lap, as he offered prayers to the tree, and thanks to Bahamut, Lord of Goodly Dragons, for his wondrous gift.\\n\\n \"Well, by the blessings of the drunken god\u0027s double visions!\" came a roar, drawing the monk from his meditation. He rose and turned, not surprised at all when Friar Dugald, nearly four hundred pounds of man-flesh, barreled into him.\\n\\n Kane didn\u0027t move an inch against that press, which would have sent mighty warriors flying backward.\\n\\n Dugald wrapped his meaty arms around the monk and slapped him hard on the back. Then he moved Kane back to arm\u0027s length - or rather, as he extended his arms, he moved himself back to arm\u0027s length - for again, the monk proved immovable.\\n\\n \"It has been too long!\" Dugald proclaimed. \"My friend, you spend all of your days wandering the land, or in the monastery to the south, and forget your friends here in Bloodstone Village.\"\\n\\n \"I carry you with me,\" Kane replied. \"You travel in my prayers and thoughts. Never are any of you forgotten.\"\\n\\n Dugald\u0027s flabby, bald head bobbed enthusiastically at that, and Kane could tell from the way he exaggerated his motions, and from the smell of him, that the friar had been consuming the blood of the vine. Dugald had found a kindred spirit within the Order of the God Ilmater in the study and patronage of St. Dionysus, the patron of such spirits, and Dugald was quite the loyal disciple.\\n\\n Kane reminded himself that his own vows of discipline against such potent drink had been his conscious choice. He must not judge others based on his personal standards.\\n\\n He turned away from Dugald to regard the tree, its spreading limbs framed by the quiet lake behind it. It had grown quite a bit in the two years since Kane\u0027s last visit to Bloodstone Village, and though the tree was only twelve years old, it already stood more than thirty feet, with branches wide and strong - branches it occasionally offered to the heroes that they might fashion items of power from the magical wood.\\n\\n \"Too long you\u0027ve been gone,\" Dugald remarked.\\n\\n \"It is my way.\"\\n\\n \"Well, how am I to argue with that?\" the friar asked.\\n\\n Kane merely shrugged.\\n\\n \"You have come for the ceremony?\"\\n\\n \"To speak with Gareth, yes.\"\\n\\n Dugald eyed him with suspicion and asked, \"What do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I know that his choice of hanging a medal about the neck of a drow is something other than expected.\"\\n\\n \"More than Kane have said as much,\" Dugald said. \"And this drow\u0027s a strange one, even by the standards of his lot, so they\u0027re saying. Do you know anything of him? Gareth knows only the stories coming from the wall.\"\\n\\n \"And yet he will offer this one the title of Bloodstone Hero, and award his companion status as a Knight of the Order?\"\\n\\n \"Apprentice Knight,\" Dugald corrected.\\n\\n \"A temporary equivocation.\"\\n\\n Dugald conceded the point with a nod. No one who had attained the title of apprentice knight had not then gone on, within two years, to full knight status - except of course for Sir Liam of Halfling Downs, who had gone missing, and was presumed slain, on the road home after attending his ceremony of honor.\\n\\n \"You have reason to believe that this drow is not worthy, my friend?\" Dugald asked.\\n\\n \"He is a dark elf.\"\\n\\n Dugald sighed and assumed a pensive, almost accusing stare.\\n\\n \"Yes, we have the sisters of Eilistraee as evidence,\" Kane replied. \"It is a precept of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose to judge the actions and not the heritage of any person. But he is a drow, who arrived here only recently. His history is unknown and I have not heard a single whisper that he serves Eilistraee.\"\\n\\n \"General Dannaway of the Vaasan Gate is meeting with the king and Lady Christine even now,\" Dugald replied. \"He speaks well of the exploits of this Jarlaxle character and the soon-to-be-apprentice knight.\"\\n\\n \"Formidable warriors.\"\\n\\n \"So it seems.\"\\n\\n \"Skill with the blade is the least important asset for a knight of the order,\" Kane said.\\n\\n \"Every knight can lay waste to his share,\" Dugald countered.\\n\\n \"Purity of purpose, adherence to conscience, and the discipline to strike or to hold in the best interests of Bloodstone,\" Kane came right back, citing the crux of the Bloodstone knight\u0027s pledge. \"Honorable General Dannaway will attest to their feats in killing monsters beyond the Vaasan Gate, no doubt, but he knows little of the character of these two.\"\\n\\n Dugald looked at his friend curiously. \"I\u0027ll be guessing that Kane does, then?\"\\n\\n The monk shrugged. Before his journey to Bloodstone Village, he had spoken to Hobart Bracegirdle, the halfling leader of the war gang the Kneebreakers, who had been operating from the Vaasan Gate in recent days. Hobart had offered a few clues to the intriguing duo, Jarlaxle and Entreri, but nothing substantial enough for Kane to yet draw any conclusions. In truth, the monk had no reason to believe that the two were anything less than their actions at the gate and in the battle outside of Palishchuk seemed to indicate. But he knew, too, that those actions had not been definitive.\\n\\n \"I fear King Gareth\u0027s choice regarding these newcomers is premature, that is all,\" he said.\\n\\n The friar nodded his concession of that point, then turned and swept his arm out to the north, where stood the grand palace of Gareth and Christine. Still under construction after a decade of work, the palace was comprised of the original Tranth home, the residence of the Baron of Bloodstone, expanded in width and with perpendicular wings running forward on either end. Most of the continuing work on the palace involved the minor details, the finishing touches, the decorative parapets and stained-glass windows. The people of Bloodstone Village - indeed, the people and artisans of the entire region known as the Bloodstone Lands - wanted the palace of their king to be reflective of his deeds and reputation. With Gareth Dragonsbane, that would prove a tall order indeed, and one that would take all the artisans of the land years to fulfill.\\n\\n Side by side, the two went to see their friends. They entered without questions, past guards who bowed in deference at the appearance of the ragged-looking man. Anyone who did not know the reputation of Grandmaster Kane would have no way of looking at the man and suspecting any such thing. He was past middle age, thin, even skinny, with fraying white hair and beard. He wore rags and no visible jewelry other than a pair of magical rings. His belt was a simple length of rough rope, his sandals worn and threadbare. Only his walking stick, white like the wood of the tree from which it was made, seemed somewhat remarkable, and that alone would not be enough to clue anyone in to the truth of the shabby-looking creature.\\n\\n For Kane, a simple wanderer, had been the one to strike the fatal blow and free the Bloodstone Lands from the grip of the Witch-King Zhengyi.\\n\\n The guards knew him, bowed as he passed, and whispered excitedly to one another when he had gone by.\\n\\n As the pair came upon the decorated white wooden doors - another gift of the White Tree - of Gareth\u0027s audience chamber, the guards posted there scrambling to open them, they discovered that another of their former adventuring band had come calling. The animated and always-excited ramblings of Celedon Kierney charged out through the doors as soon as they were cracked open.\\n\\n \"Gareth has put out the call to Spysong, then,\" Kane remarked to Dugald. \"That is good.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that what brought you here?\" Dugald asked, for Kane, like Celedon, was part of the Bloodstone scouting network known as Spysong, with the monk serving as its principle agent in Vaasa.\\n\\n Kane shook his head. \"No formal call summoned me, no. I thought it prudent.\"\\n\\n The doors swung wider and the pair stepped through the threshold. All conversation in the room stopped. A wide smile erupted on the handsome face of King Gareth. Dugald had been expected, of course, but Kane\u0027s arrival was obviously a rather pleasant surprise.\\n\\n Beautiful Lady Christine, too, offered a smile, though she remained less animated than her passionate husband, as always.\\n\\n Celedon offered Kane the raised back of his right hand, fingers stiffened, thumb straight up. He held it there for a moment, then turned his hand so that his thumb tapped his heart, the greeting of Spysong.\\n\\n Kane acknowledged it with a nod, and moved forward beside Dugald to stand before the dais that held the thrones of Gareth and Christine. He immediately noticed the weariness in Gareth\u0027s blue eyes. The man seemed very fit for his forties. He wore a sleeveless black tunic, his bare, muscled arms showing no weakness. His hair was still much more black than gray, though a bit of the salt had crept in. His jaw line remained firm and sharp.\\n\\n But his eyes...\\n\\n The blue still showed its youthful luster, but Kane looked past the shine to the increased heaviness of Gareth\u0027s eyelids and the slight discoloration of the skin around his eyes. The weight of ruling the land had settled upon his strong shoulders, and wore at him despite his disposition and despite the love showered on him always by almost everyone in Damara.\\n\\n Leadership with consequence would do that to a man, Kane knew. To any man. There was no escaping such a burden.\\n\\n Court etiquette demanded that King Gareth speak first, officially greeting his newest guests, but Celedon Kierney moved in between the guests and the royals.\\n\\n \"A-a drow!\" he yammered, waving his arms in disbelief. \"Surely that is what brought Master Kane to court... his surprise - nay, astonishment - that you are doing such a thing.\"\\n\\n Gareth sighed and shot a plaintive look Kane\u0027s way.\\n\\n Kane, though, found his attention stolen by the crinkled nose of General Dannaway, who stared at him with obvious disgust. The monk, dressed in his dirty rags, was not unaccustomed to such expressions, of course, nor did they concern him.\\n\\n Still, he met the man\u0027s gaze with an intense look, one so unnerving that Dannaway actually took a step backward.\\n\\n \"I - I must be going, my king,\" Dannaway stammered, and bowed repeatedly.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Gareth replied. \"You are dismissed.\"\\n\\n Dannaway moved at once for the exit, crinkling his nose again as he passed near an uncaring Kane.\\n\\n But Dugald, smile wide, was not so generous. He put a hand on Dannaway\u0027s elbow to halt the man and make him turn, then whispered - but loudly enough for all to hear, \"He could insert his hand into your chest, pull forth your heart, hold it beating before your disbelieving eyes, then put it back before your body ever missed it.\" He ended with an exaggerated wink and the unnerved Dannaway stumbled away and nearly to the ground.\\n\\n He rushed ahead so quickly that he overbalanced, and had not the guard at the white doors swung them wide at his approach, he no doubt would have barreled into them head-first.\\n\\n \"Dugald....\" Lady Christine warned.\\n\\n \"Oh, he should know,\" the fat friar replied, and he laughed, and so did Celedon. Gareth soon joined in, and even Christine could not completely hide her giggle. Kane, though, showed little emotion.\\n\\n It was just the five friends, then, and all pretense and protocol could not hold against the bonds of their shared experiences.\\n\\n \"A drow?\" Kane asked after the titters died away.\\n\\n \"Dannaway speaks highly of him, and of the drow\u0027s friend,\" Gareth replied.\\n\\n \"Dannaway sees it as a source of glory for his work at the wall,\" Celedon put in. \"And a mitigation of the great losses incurred in the journey he instigated to the replica of Castle Perilous.\"\\n\\n \"Not much of a replica if these vagabonds so easily defeated it,\" Dugald scoffed.\\n\\n \"We do not know their worth,\" Kane said. \"And I remind all that a great ranger fell at that castle. We know not its true nature, nor the depth of its powers. To that end, Spysong has dispatched Riordan to Palishchuk to begin a more thorough investigation.\"\\n\\n The mention of Riordan Parnell brought nods all around. Another member of the band of seven who had defeated Zhengyi, the bard still served the land well with his uncanny ability to coax the truth from reluctant witnesses.\\n\\n \"Other investigations will be needed, of course,\" Kane said. \"I suggest that our responses be kept to a minimum until they are completed.\"\\n\\n \"Never a moment to relax, eh, my friend?\" asked Gareth.\\n\\n \"Riordan went at the request of the Duke of Soravia,\" the monk replied, referring to still another of the seven heroes, Olwen Forest-friend, a bear of a man whose laughter would often shake the walls of a tavern. \"Olwen did not receive the news of Mariabronne\u0027s demise well.\"\\n\\n \"His protege,\" Dugald remarked, nodding. \"Mariabronne studied under him for so many years, and has lately spent much time at Olwen\u0027s side.\" He gave a sigh and shook his head. \"I must offer Olwen comfort.\"\\n\\n \"The Duke of Soravia will not attend tomorrow\u0027s ceremony,\" Gareth said, nodding in agreement.\\n\\n \"He believes it to be premature, no doubt,\" said Kane.\\n\\n \"We have visiting dignitaries who wished to witness the event,\" Lady Christine said. \"Baroness Sylvia of Ostel - \"\\n\\n \"We cannot deny the accomplishments of this group,\" Gareth interrupted, but Kane continued to look at Christine.\\n\\n \"The Baroness of Ostel,\" the monk said. \"Whose closest ally is...?\"\\n\\n \"The Baron of Morov,\" said Celedon. \"Dimian Ree.\"\\n\\n Gareth rubbed his chin. \"Ree is an unseemly character, I agree. But he is, first and foremost, a baron of Damara.\" Celedon started to interrupt, but Gareth held up his hand to stop him. \"I know the rumors of his relationship with Timoshenko,\" the king said. \"And I do not doubt them, though none of us have found any solid evidence of corroboration between Morov and the Citadel of Assassins. But even if it were true, I cannot move against Dimian Ree. Heliogabalus is his domain, and it remains the principle city of Damara, whether I am there or here.\"\\n\\n Gareth\u0027s point was well taken by all in the room. The Sister Baronies, as Morov and Ostel were often called, commanded the center of Damara, and Baron Ree and Baroness Sylvia had the unquestioning loyalty of more than sixty thousand Damarans, nearly half the population of the kingdom. Gareth was king and had the love of all, so it seemed, but everyone in the room understood the tentative nature of Gareth\u0027s ascent. For in unifying Damara under one ruler, he had reduced the power of several long-entrenched baronies. And in trying to bring Vaasa into his realm to create the greater Kingdom of Bloodstone, he was rattling the nerves of many Damarans, who had known untamed Vaasa as a source of naught but misery for all of their lives.\\n\\n More talk went on outside of Bloodstone Village than within, Gareth and everyone else in the room knew well, and not all of that talk favored the creation of a greater Kingdom of Bloodstone, or even the continued unification of the previously independent baronies.\\n\\n Though Baroness Sylvia and Lady Christine had forged something of a friendship over the past few years, no one in the room thought highly of Baron Dimian Ree of Morov, considering him to be the consummate self-serving politician. But none in the room dared underestimate him, either, given the volatile political climate, and so Gareth\u0027s words put a block in the path of the debate.\\n\\n \"The drow and his friend approach Bloodstone Village in the company of a dwarf,\" Kane said.\\n\\n \"Athrogate, by name,\" said Gareth. \"A most unpleasant fellow, but a fine warrior, by all accounts. A second dwarf died in the castle, and will be honored posthumously.\"\\n\\n \"Athrogate is a known associate of Timoshenko and Knellict,\" said Kane. \"As was the wizard, Canthan, who also fell in the castle.\"\\n\\n \"Master Kane, you have quite a conspiracy envisioned,\" said Christine.\\n\\n Kane took the jab with good nature, and bowed to the Queen of Bloodstone. \"No, milady,\" he corrected. \"It is my duty to serve Gareth\u0027s throne and King Gareth, and so I do. The web of a potential conspiracy appears faintly visible if the light is just right, but it could be a trick of the sun, I know.\"\\n\\n \"Wherever we have seen a filament of a web, we have found a spider,\" Celedon interjected, rather loudly. \"It is not right, I say. There is more here than we know, and we should not be offering such honors as apprentice knight of the order until the questions are answered beyond all doubt. I\u0027ll not - \"\\n\\n Kane stopped him with an upraised hand, right before Gareth could tell him to shut up. \"The drow, his human companion, and the dwarf,\" the monk said in a quiet voice. \"Be they friends, we have gained worthy allies. Be they enemies, and we have put them under our eye, clearly so. To know your enemy is a warrior\u0027s greatest asset. If you wish to remain as king, Gareth my friend, and hope to expand beyond the gate fortress north of here, then you need to know Athrogate and the creatures of the shadows who work his strings.\"\\n\\n \"And if these three, this drow, the dwarf, and the man on whom I will tomorrow bestow knighthood, are truly aligned with the Citadel of Assassins?\" Gareth asked, though his grin betrayed the fact that he already knew well the answer.\\n\\n Kane shrugged as if it did not matter. \"We will reward them and honor them, and never allow them free passage to any place or position where they might do us harm.\"\\n\\n Even Celedon calmed at that assurance, for when Kane offered such words, he always delivered on his promise.\\n\\n Soon after, Celedon, Dugald, and Kane took their leave, promising to return later that evening for a feast in their honor.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hoping to lure Olwen here with a grand table,\" Christine said to Gareth when they were alone - alone except for the guards, who had become such a fixture of their lives that they were all but invisible to the couple.\\n\\n \"Olwen can smell an orc from a hundred yards, so it is said,\" Gareth replied. \"And so it is also said that he can smell a meal from a hundred miles.\"\\n\\n \"It is more than a hundred miles to Kinbrace,\" Christine reminded, referring to the seat of Soravia\u0027s power, where Olwen dwelt. \"Even with his enchanted boots, even with his growling stomach urging him on, Olwen could not cover that distance in time for your feast.\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking that another might enjoy the reunion of the seven,\" Gareth slyly replied.\\n\\n Christine rolled her blue eyes, for she knew of whom her husband spoke, and she wasn\u0027t thrilled at the prospect of entertaining Emelyn the Gray. The oldest of the band who had defeated Zhengyi, past his seventieth birthday, Emelyn\u0027s understanding of \"civility\" often tried Lady Christine\u0027s patience. Glad she was those years ago when the wizard announced that he would return to the Warrenwood ten miles southeast of Bloodstone Village, and happier still was she when it became apparent that he would rarely return for a visit.\\n\\n Gareth moved out of the audience chamber to a side corridor that led to his private rooms. He entered a small anteroom to his bedchamber and moved to a desk set against the side wall, near his bedroom door. The back of the desk rose high above the writing table, and was draped with a silken cloth. Gareth pulled the drape free, revealing a mirror, framed in gold that was molded into exotic runes and symbols. From the side of the mirror, the king slid forth a six-inch red ball set in a golden base. He positioned it right before the mirror and lifted his hand as if to cover it.\\n\\n \"There is no other way?\" Christine asked from the doorway behind him.\\n\\n Gareth glanced back at her and offered a grin as she rolled her eyes yet again. He knew that she was only half-serious, for Emelyn was indeed a trial, and in all truth, Gareth had not been sorry at the wizard\u0027s announcement of his \"retirement\" with the centaurs of Warrenwood.\\n\\n \"We may be needing Emelyn\u0027s services soon enough,\" Gareth replied, and he placed his hand on top of the red ball and closed his eyes, picturing his old friend in his thoughts.\\n\\n A few moments later, he looked into the mirror, and instead of seeing his own reflection, he saw a separate room. It was full of vials and skulls, books and trinkets, statues small and large, and a grand and ornate desk that seemed as alive as the white tree from which it had been fashioned.\\n\\n At the desk with his back to Gareth sat an old man in satiny gray robes. His white hair, long and unkempt, hung down nearly to the desk - in fact its end strands showed that they had dipped into the inkwell more than once - as he hunched over his parchment.\\n\\n \"Emelyn?\" Gareth asked, then more insistently, \"Emelyn!\"\\n\\n The wizard straightened, glanced left, then right, then turned around to look behind him and across the room at the sister mirror set in his wall.\\n\\n \"Peering in uninvited, are we?\" he said in a nasal and scratchy voice. \"Hoping to catch a view of Gabrielle, no doubt.\" He ended with a cackle of delight.\\n\\n Gareth just shook his head, and wondered again why such a beautiful young woman as Gabrielle had agreed to marry the old kook.\\n\\n \"Oh, I know your game!\" Emelyn accused, wagging a gnarled old finger Gareth\u0027s way and flashing a yellow, gap-toothed smile.\\n\\n \"One you perfected, no doubt,\" Gareth dryly replied, \"which is why I keep a shroud over my mirror.\"\\n\\n The wizard\u0027s smile disappeared. \"Never were you one to share, Gareth.\"\\n\\n Behind the king, Lady Christine made her presence known by clearing her throat, loudly. Of course, that only made Emelyn cackle all the more.\\n\\n \"I was looking for you, my friend, though Lady Gabrielle is surely a more welcome sight before my eyes,\" said Gareth.\\n\\n \"She is in Heliogabalus, seeking components and potions.\"\\n\\n \"A pity, then, for I have come with an invitation.\"\\n\\n \"To see a drow honored?\" Emelyn replied. \"Bah!\"\\n\\n Gareth accepted that with a nod. He knew, of course, that Emelyn would have heard about the morning\u0027s ceremony. Surely the word was general all about Bloodstone Valley.\\n\\n \"Kane and Celedon have arrived in Bloodstone Village,\" Gareth explained. \"I think it a good time for old friends to eat and drink, and speak of adventures past.\"\\n\\n Emelyn started to respond, apparently in the negative, but stopped short and chewed his lip. A moment later, he rose from his chair and faced Gareth directly. \"There is little I can do until Gabrielle\u0027s return, in any case,\" he said.\\n\\n The mirror filled with smoke.\\n\\n And so did the room, and both Gareth and Christine gave a shout and fell back.\\n\\n The smoke cleared, revealing a sputtering Emelyn, waving his hands before his face to chase the fumes away.\\n\\n \"Never used to... create such combustion,\" Emelyn explained, coughing repeatedly as he spoke. At last he straightened and smoothed his robes. He looked alternately into the blank stares of Gareth and Christine, then back to Gareth. \"So when do we eat?\"\\n\\n \"I was hoping that perhaps you could retrieve Olwen before the meal,\" Gareth explained.\\n\\n \"Olwen?\"\\n\\n \"The Duke of Soravia,\" Christine clarified, and Emelyn snapped a stare over her.\\n\\n \"How might we locate him?\" Emelyn asked. \"He is never near the six castles of Kinbrace of late. Always out and about.\"\\n\\n \"We could look,\" Gareth said. He stepped aside and waved his arm back at the scrying mirror.\\n\\n \"More than a meal?\" Emelyn asked.\\n\\n \"You have heard of the goings-on in Vaasa?\"\\n\\n \"I have heard that you mean to honor a drow, and that there is apparently a knight-in-waiting.\"\\n\\n \"A Zhengyian construct appeared north of Palishchuk,\" Gareth explained.\\n\\n \"They seem to be more common of late. There was a tower outside of Heliogabalus - \"\\n\\n \"Mariabronne the Rover fell within the walls of this one.\"\\n\\n That set Emelyn back on his heels.\\n\\n \"It was said to be a replica of Castle Perilous,\" Lady Christine interjected. \"Alive with gargoyles, and ruled by a dracolich.\"\\n\\n Emelyn\u0027s eyes, gray like his robes, widened with every proclamation. \"And this drow and the others defeated the menace?\"\\n\\n Gareth nodded. \"But the construct remains.\"\\n\\n \"And you wish me to fly to the north to see what I might learn,\" Emelyn reasoned.\\n\\n \"That would seem prudent.\"\\n\\n \"And Olwen?\" Emelyn asked, but before Gareth or Christine could respond, the old wizard gasped and held up his hand. \"Ah, Mariabronne!\" he said. \"I\u0027d not considered Olwen\u0027s love for that one.\"\\n\\n \"Find him?\" Gareth bade Emelyn, and again he indicated the mirror.\\n\\n Emelyn nodded and stepped forward.\\n\\n No one in Faerun was better at preparing a banquet than Christine Dragonsbane. She was the daughter of Baron Tranth, the former ruler of the region known as Bloodstone Valley, which included Bloodstone Village. Growing up in the time of Zhengyi, in the noble House that controlled the sole pass between Vaasa and Damara, Christine had witnessed scores of feasts prepared for visiting dignitaries, both from the duchies and baronies of Damara and from Zhengyi\u0027s court. In the years before open warfare, much of the duplicity that had lured Damara into a position vulnerable to Zhengyi\u0027s imperialistic designs had occurred right there in Bloodstone Village, at the table of Baron Tranth.\\n\\n The meal planned for that night held no such potential for intrigue, of course. The guests were the friends of Gareth, honest and true companions who had fought beside him in the desperate struggle against the Witch-King. Riordan Parnell wouldn\u0027t be there, as he was off to Palishchuk, which complicated things for Christine a bit. Had he been in attendance, Riordan, an extraordinary bard, would have provided much of the entertainment. And entertainment was paramount on Gareth\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \"This is a meal for solidarity of purpose and agreement of how we should proceed,\" he told Christine not long after Emelyn had magically flown out to Soravia. \"But most of all it is for Olwen. He has lost a child, in effect.\"\\n\\n \"And we have both lost a niece,\" Christine reminded.\\n\\n Gareth nodded, but neither of them were truly devastated by the death of Commander Ellery. She had been a relative, but a distant one, and one that neither Gareth nor Christine had known very well. Gareth had seen her only a few times and had spoken to her only once, on the occasion of her appointment to the Army of Bloodstone.\\n\\n \"This night is for Olwen,\" Christine agreed, and took her leave.\\n\\n Soon after, though, they found out that they were both incorrect. Emelyn the Gray returned from Soravia, appearing in Gareth\u0027s audience chamber amidst a cloud of smoke. Coughing and waving his hands, more with annoyance than with any expectation that he would clear the cloud, Emelyn stood alone, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"Olwen is not in his castle,\" the old wizard explained. \"Nor is he anywhere in the city, or in Kinnery or Steppenhall. He went out soon after the news of Mariabronne\u0027s fall reached Kinbrace, along with several of his rangerly ilk. Who knows what silliness they are up to.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Rangerly\u0027?\" Gareth asked.\\n\\n \"Druidic, then?\" Emelyn offered. \"How am I to properly describe men who dance about the trees and offer prayers of gratitude to beautiful and benevolent creatures right before and right after they kill them?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Rangerly\u0027 will suffice,\" the king conceded, and Emelyn wagged his wrinkled old head.\\n\\n \"Do you have any notion of where they went?\" Gareth asked.\\n\\n \"Somewhere in the northeast - some grove they have deemed sacred, no doubt.\"\\n\\n \"A funeral?\"\\n\\n Emelyn shrugged.\\n\\n \"And there was no way to find him?\" Gareth asked.\\n\\n Emelyn\u0027s look became less accommodating, his expression telling Gareth in no uncertain terms that if he could have found the man, Olwen would be standing beside him.\\n\\n \"Olwen has been an adventurer for most of his life,\" Emelyn reminded. \"He has known loss as often as victory and has buried many friends.\"\\n\\n \"As have we all.\"\\n\\n \"He will overcome his grief,\" said the wizard. \"Better, perhaps, that he is not here in the morning when you celebrate those who survived the trip to this Zhengyian construct. Olwen would have strong questions for them, do not doubt, particularly for the drow.\"\\n\\n \"We all have questions, my friend,\" Gareth said.\\n\\n Emelyn eyed him with open suspicion, and Gareth couldn\u0027t hold back his smile from his ever-perceptive old companion.\\n\\n \"How could we not?\" the king asked. \"We had an unusual party travel north on our behalf, unbeknownst to us, and we are now left an unusual band of victorious survivors. We have a construct of unknown origin - \"\\n\\n Emelyn held up his hand to stop his friend. \"I detest Palishchuk,\" he remarked.\\n\\n Gareth\u0027s grin widened. \"I could trust no other with this most important investigation. Riordan is already there, doing that which Riordan does best - interrogating people without them even realizing it - but he has no practical understanding of such creation magic as this.\"\\n\\n \"I am not fond of Riordan, either,\" grumped Emelyn, and Gareth couldn\u0027t contain a chuckle. \"But he is a bard, is he not? Are bards not especially skilled at determining the origins and history of places and dweomers?\"\\n\\n \"Emelyn....\" Gareth said.\\n\\n The old wizard huffed. \"Palishchuk. Oh joy of joys. To be surrounded by half-orcs and their unparalleled wit and wisdom.\"\\n\\n \"One of the heroes who defeated the castle\u0027s guardians was a half-orc wizard,\" said Gareth, and that seemed to pique Emelyn\u0027s curiosity for a moment.\\n\\n A brief moment. \"And I know a dwarf who dances gracefully,\" came the sarcastic reply. \"For a dwarf. Which means that the area clerics need only repair a few broken toes among the spectators after each performance. Could a half-orc wizard be any more promising?\"\\n\\n \"When the survivors returned to the Vaasan Gate, they reported that Wingham was in Palishchuk.\"\\n\\n That did interest Emelyn, obviously so.\\n\\n \"Enough, my king,\" he surrendered. \"You wish me to go, and so I go, but it will not be as brief a journey as my trip to Soravia, a land that I know well and can thus teleport to and from quickly. Expect me to be gone a tenday, and that only if the riddles presented by the Zhengyian construct are not too tightly wound. Am I to leave at once, or might I partake of the feast you promised in order to lure me here in the first place?\"\\n\\n \"Eat, and eat well,\" said Gareth, smiling, then he paused and took on a more serious visage. \"I trust that your magic is powerful enough to lift you and transport you when your belly is full?\"\\n\\n \"If you were not the king, I\u0027d offer a demonstration.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, but if I were not the king, then Zhengyi would not likely allow it.\"\\n\\n Emelyn just shook his head and walked off to the guest rooms where he could clean up and prepare for Christine\u0027s table.\\n\\n It was a night of toasts to old friends and old times. The five adventuring companions lifted their glasses to Olwen, most of all, and to Mariabronne, who had held such promise. They reiterated their goal of unifying the Bloodstone Lands, Damara and Vaasa, into a singular kingdom, and of defeating any and all remnants of the tyrant Zhengyi.\\n\\n They talked of the next morning\u0027s ceremony, sharing what little they knew of the man who would be granted knighthood and of his strange, ebon-skinned companion. Celedon Kierney promised that they would know much more of the pair soon enough, a vow he made with a nod of approval from Kane. There was no disagreement at that table among the friends who had struggled hand-in-hand for more than a decade. They saw the challenges before them, the potential trouble, and the mystery of the newcomers, and they methodically set out their plans.\\n\\n In the morning, after Friar Dugald offered a blessing for them all, Emelyn departed for Palishchuk and Celedon set out for Heliogabalus. Celedon asked Kane to accompany him, or to fly him part of the way on the magical carpet, but Kane declined. He wanted to witness the day\u0027s events.\\n\\n And so as King Gareth and Queen Christine prepared for their ceremony, they knew that they were well flanked by powerful friends. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/road-of-the-patriarch-the-sellswords-3/page-4.html","bookId":2139,"book":{"id":2139,"title":"Road of the Patriarch (The Sellswords #3)","description":"Storyline: The Sellswords #3: Road of the Patriarch \\n Explore the mind of an assassin in R.A.
