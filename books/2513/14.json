{"id":108209,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The following week Kalika attains full maturity, approximately twenty years of age, about the same age I was when I was changed into a vampire. At this point her growth seems to halt. I am not surprised. It is a fact that a human being is at his or her greatest strength, mentally and physically, just out of his or her teens. Certainly Kalika is very powerful, but how powerful I\u0027m not sure. Except for the incident with Billy, she never demonstrates her abilities in front of me. One thing is sure, though--she no longer needs me to bring her lunch. Now she leaves the house for long stretches of time--on foot and at night. When she returns, I don\u0027t ask where she\u0027s been or who she\u0027s been with. I don\u0027t want to know. Of course that\u0027s a lie. I scrutinize the papers each day for reports of unexplained murders. Yet I find none, and it makes me wonder. The police have yet to find Billy--what is left of him. I know it is only a matter of time. I hope they will uncover his victims as well. My hand and shoulder are still bandaged. I did not allow myself the luxury of a doctor and hospital, but I did manage to sew myself up fairly well. Still, I know I will be scarred for life. The change in my daughter\u0027s eating habits means that I no longer need to keep Eric locked in the spare bedroom. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t figure out a way to let him go and keep him from running straight to the police. Simply moving to another city, or even anoth?er state, is not a solution. Well, it would probably help, but I don\u0027t want to move, not until Paula has her baby. Kalika and Ray don\u0027t want to move either. They have stated their opinion many times. So I keep Eric locked up, but have stopped taking his blood. It had been my hope that this would cheer him up, and he\u0027d be able to gain back his strength. But Eric is now deep in the throes of depression and won\u0027t eat a bite. \"Come on, Eric,\" I say as I offer him a hamburger and fries. \"This is a McDonald\u0027s Big Mac and their golden delicious french fries, large size. I\u0027ve even brought you a vanilla shake.\" I touch his head as he refuses to even look at me. He has lost over thirty pounds since meeting me, and his skin is a pasty yellow. There are black circles under his eyes, from his grief, and from the times I hit him. His nose is still broken; he has trouble breathing, especially tied up as he is. I add gently, \"You\u0027ve got to eat something. You\u0027re just wasting away in here.\" \"Then why don\u0027t you let me go like you promised?\" he asks quietly. \"I\u0027m sick--you know I\u0027m really sick.\" \"I am going to let you go. Just as soon as I figure out the logistics of the release. You understand I have to worry about you talking to the police. I have to be long gone from this place before you are freed.\" \"I won\u0027t talk to the police. I just want to go home.\" \"I know you do. It won\u0027t be long now.\" I push the hamburger his way. \"Have a bite, just for me, and I\u0027ll have some of your fries. We can pretend we\u0027re in that coffee shop you took me to on our first date.\" That is probably not the best thing to say. He begins to sob again. \"I thought you were a nice girl. I just wanted to talk to you. I didn\u0027t know you would hurt me and take all my blood.\" \"But I stopped taking your blood. Things are look?ing up. Soon you\u0027ll see your mom and dad. And they\u0027ll be so excited to see you. Just think of that, Eric, and try to keep a positive attitude. Imagine what an incredible homecoming you\u0027re going to have. You\u0027ll be interviewed by every TV station in the country. You can even make your story more exciting than it really was. You can say how a whole horde of vam?pires tortured you night and day and used your blood for satanic rituals. The media will love that--they\u0027re really into the devil. You\u0027ll be a celebrity, a hero, and after that you\u0027ll probably get lots of dates. The girls will come to you. Heroes are sexy. You won\u0027t have to go looking for girls in the park.\" My pep talk is wasted on him. He stares at me with bloodshot eyes and sniffles. \"Even if you wanted to let me go, she\u0027d never let you.\" I pause. \"Who\u0027s she?\" \"The one you\u0027ve been giving my blood to.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" \"I\u0027ve seen her. You serve her and you don\u0027t know it, but I know she\u0027s not human. I\u0027ve seen her eyes, the red fire deep inside. She drinks human blood and she\u0027s evil.\" He nods like a man who\u0027s been granted a vision by God and won\u0027t be convinced otherwise. \"After she kills me and eats my guts, she\u0027s going to kill you and eat your brains.\" Well, I don\u0027t know what to say to that. Placing the hamburger in his lap, I leave the room. Ray is sitting in the living room. Kalika is in the backyard, sitting in the full lotus and meditating with her eyes closed in the bright sun, wearing a one-piece black bathing suit. She sits on a white towel in the center of the lawn and doesn\u0027t move a fraction of an inch, or even seem to breathe. This is a new habit of hers, but I am afraid to ask what she mediates on. Perhaps her own name, or the secret forms of it. They are reputed to be powerful mantras. Ray looks up at me. \"Is he eating?\" \"No.\" \"What are we going to do with him?\" I sit on the couch across from Ray. \"I don\u0027t know. Let him go.\" \"We can\u0027t let him go. Not now.\" \"Then we\u0027ll let him go later,\" I say. Ray shakes his head. \"I think that\u0027s a bad idea. It will require us to cover our tracks. He\u0027ll just give the authorities information we don\u0027t want them to have. Think about it a minute before you dismiss it. You said yourself that the government might still be searching for you. What are they going to think when they hear the story of a young man who was held captive by a beautiful blond woman who systemati?cally drained his blood? They\u0027ll put two and two together, and they\u0027ll start a manhunt for you unlike anything that\u0027s been seen in this country. Remember, they still want that vampire blood.\" I speak in a flat voice. \"What is it you want me to think about?\" Ray hesitates. \"Just getting rid of the problem.\" \"You mean kill Eric and bury him in the back?yard?\" \"I don\u0027t think we should bury him there. But, yes, I don\u0027t see how we can let him go and expect to remain free ourselves.\" I smile as I stare at him. It is one of those smiles a salesperson gives to a customer. \"You know, something just occurred to me.\" \"What?\" \"I don\u0027t know who you are. Oh, you look like Ray. You talk like him and you even have his memories. But I honestly don\u0027t know who you are.\" \"Sita, be serious. You have to face reality.\" \"That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m doing. The Ray I met and loved would never talk about killing an innocent young man. No matter what the consequences to himself. The idea would never even enter his mind. And one more thing, I\u0027ve been watching our daughter the last few days and I swear she doesn\u0027t look a bit like you. You don\u0027t share a single feature. How can that be?\" Ray snorts. \"You\u0027re the one who should be able to answer that question. You\u0027re the one who got pregnant.\" \"I wish I could answer it. I believe if I could, many other questions would be answered as well.\" \"Such as?\" I lose my smile. \"I don\u0027t know how much I should tell you. I don\u0027t trust you, and I\u0027m not going to kill Eric. We\u0027ll leave here before it comes to that. I don\u0027t care if he does set the government on my tail.\" \"You will not leave here until Paula has her baby.\" \"Paula\u0027s baby is not the topic of this conversation. Also, I notice you\u0027re not responding to my accusa?tions. You\u0027re not even trying to defend yourself.\" \"They\u0027re so ridiculous. What can I say?\" He glances down the hall. \"Eric has to die, and the sooner the better.\" \"Have you shared this with Kalika?\" \"Yes.\" \"Does she agree with you?\" Ray is evasive. \"She didn\u0027t say one way or the other.\" \"She never says much.\" I straighten up and point a finger at Ray. \"But let\u0027s make one thing perfectly clear. If you so much as harm a single hair on Eric\u0027s head, you\u0027ll regret it.\" Ray is amused. \"You\u0027re not a vampire anymore. You have nothing to back up your threats. I\u0027m not given a chance to respond. By chance, if anything is chance, a police car pulls into our drive?way at that moment. The two officers are almost to the door when I remember that I have not replaced Eric\u0027s gag. I\u0027ve been letting him be without it for the last few days. He knows the penalty for crying out. Yet if he hears the police in the house, what will he do? Ray runs into the back room, not into Eric\u0027s. I answer the door. A blond-haired cop and a dark-haired one. The handsome black one holds a picture of Eric in his hand. Wonderful. \"Hello,\" he says. \"I\u0027m Officer Williams and this is my partner, Officer Kent. We\u0027re canvassing the neighborhood for information concerning the whereabouts of this young man. His name is Eric Hawkins. He vanished close to three weeks ago.\" He pauses. \"May we come in?\" \"Sure.\" I open the door wider. As they step inside, I ask, \"Was this guy from around here? Excuse me, please, have a seat.\" Kent and Williams settle themselves on my couch. Williams does the talking. He is the leader of the two--his eyes are everywhere, searching for clues. Well-muscled Kent sits content like a comfortable jock after a hard game. I plop down across from them. \"Actually, Eric lives some distance from here,\" Williams says. \"But we have a report from one of your neighbors that a guy who fit his description was seen entering your house. Also, this same neighbor believes she saw Eric\u0027s car parked out in front of your house on the day he disappeared.\" \"So you\u0027re not just canvassing the neighborhood. You\u0027ve come here specifically to see me?\" I gesture to Eric\u0027s picture. \"I\u0027ve never seen this guy in my life.\" Williams is grave. \"We also have a description from two guys that Eric was playing basketball with on the day he disappeared. They say he left Scott Park in the company of a young woman who matches your de?scription.\" I raise my hand, palm out. \"Hold on! You do not have my description. I don\u0027t even know where Scott Park is. What exactly did these guys say?\" Williams consults notes jotted on a piece of folded paper. \"That he left the park in the company of a beautiful blond girl approximately eighteen to twenty-one. Her hair was long, like yours.\" I\u0027m not impressed. \"There are literally tens of thousands of cute blond girls with long hair in South?ern California.\" \"That is true ma\u0027am,\" Williams says. \"You\u0027re just a lead we\u0027re checking out.\" He pauses. \"Did you have a guest with a blue Honda Civic park in your driveway three weeks ago?\" \"I can\u0027t remember. Lots of friends drop by. They have all kinds of cars.\" \"Do you have a friend who looks like Eric?\" Williams asks. \"Someone your neighbor might have mistakenly identified as Eric.\" I shrug. \"I have a couple of friends who resemble him superficially.\" Williams glances in the backyard. Kalika was no longer there. \"Would you mind if we looked around?\" he asks. \"Do you have a search warrant?\" Williams is cagey. \"We just stopped by to ask a few questions.\" \"Then I certainly do mind. Look, I live here with my boyfriend and a girlfriend. We\u0027re not kidnappers, and I resent your implying that we are.\" Kent speaks for the first time. \"Then why won\u0027t you let us look around?\" \"That\u0027s my choice.\" \"What happened to your hand?\" Kent asks, point?ing to the bandage that covers Billy\u0027s second good swing at me. \"I cut it on a broken glass,\" I say. \"Hello?\" Kalika says softly as she enters the living loom from the direction of the hall, a towel tied around her waist over her bathing suit. \"Is there a problem?\" \"No,\" I say quickly. \"These men were just leaving.\" Williams stands and holds out the picture of Eric for Kalika to see. \"Have you ever seen this young man?\" Kalika studies the photograph. Then looks my way with a cool smile. \"Yes.\" That\u0027s my daughter. She would talk about Billy next. \"Where did you see him?\" Williams demands, casting me a hard look. Kalika is thoughtful. \"I can show you the place. It\u0027s not far from here. Would you like to take me there?\" I clear my throat. \"That\u0027s not necessary.\" \"I don\u0027t mind,\" Kalika says. \"It\u0027s not a problem.\" I lower my head. Arguing with her in front of these men will not help. \"Don\u0027t be gone long,\" I say. Kalika leaves with the officers. She doesn\u0027t even bother to change out of her suit. The men don\u0027t seem to mind. Kalika is more stunning than her mother, and they can\u0027t take their eyes off her. I pray they don\u0027t take their eyes off her, and that they don\u0027t have families. It is them I am worried about now. Paula calls ten minutes after Kalika leaves. She\u0027s in labor. I\u0027ll be there in two minutes, I promise. Running out the door, Ray stops me. \"Call us when the baby\u0027s been born.\" I step past him. I haven\u0027t told him who was on the phone but I suppose it shows on my face. \"I\u0027ll think about it.\" He speaks to my back as I go down the steps. \"Remember, you promised Kalika you would let her see the baby. Don\u0027t forget.\" I ignore him, or wish I could.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-the-last-vampire-4/page-14.html","bookId":2513,"book":{"id":2513,"title":"Phantom (The Last Vampire #4)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Last Vampire #4) The dead alchemist\u0027s experiment has worked.
