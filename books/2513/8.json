{"id":108204,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Before entering my Beverly Hills house, I search the street and the surrounding houses for signs of anyone watching. The FBI\u0027s methods are not unfamil?iar to me. The house appears unwatched. Once in?side, I gather the supplies I need to turn Eric into a serious anemic. But before leaving I stop to call Seymour. I haven\u0027t spoken to him since I said good night in the hotel by the beach. Even the note I left said little.\\n\\n Sorry, Seymour. Got to go. You know this is for the best. Love, Sita.\\n\\n \"Hello?\" he says.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n He takes a long time to answer. His voice comes out harsh. \"What do you want?\"\\n\\n I speak with sincerity. \"Just to hear your voice, Seymour. I miss you.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right.\"\\n\\n \"I do. I really do.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t tell you.\"\\n\\n \"I have to go.\"\\n\\n \"No! Wait! You know why I can\u0027t tell you.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t know why. I thought you were my friend. Friends don\u0027t leave each other in the middle of the night.\" He lowers his voice and there is pain in it. \"Why did you leave?\"\\n\\n I hesitate. I didn\u0027t plan to tell him.\\n\\n \"Ray\u0027s come back.\"\\n\\n Seymour is astounded. \"That\u0027s impossible.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true. We\u0027re living together.\" I add, \"We\u0027ve got a daughter.\"\\n\\n \"Sita, what kind of fool do you think I am? You haven\u0027t had time to have a daughter.\"\\n\\n My voice cracks. \"I know that. But this one came rather fast.\"\\n\\n He hears that I\u0027m serious. \"Tell me everything that\u0027s happened since I last saw you.\"\\n\\n So I tell him because I need someone to talk to. As always he listens patiently, closely, and I have to wonder what insights he will provide when I\u0027m fin?ished. He\u0027s so smart--he always has something inter?esting to say about my numerous predicaments. Yet the next words out of his mouth shock me.\\n\\n \"Why do you assume this guy is Ray?\" he asks when I finish.\\n\\n I have to laugh, although I almost choke on it.\\n\\n \"What kind of question is that? Of course it\u0027s Ray. I know it\u0027s Ray. Who else could it be?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know who else it could be. But how do you know it\u0027s Ray? Remember, he died.\"\\n\\n \"Because he looks like Ray. He acts like Ray. He knows everything Ray knew. He can\u0027t be an im?postor.\"\\n\\n Seymour speaks calmly. \"Let\u0027s take each of your statements. He looks like Ray you say. OK, I grant you that because you\u0027ve seen him and I haven\u0027t. But you say he acts like Ray? I don\u0027t think so. The Ray you describe isn\u0027t the Ray I remember.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been through a lot. In a sense, he died during the blast It was only Eddie\u0027s blood that brought him back to life.\"\\n\\n \"That worries me right there. Eddie was the incar?nation of evil. What would his blood do to someone\u0027s psyche? Even the psyche of another vampire?\"\\n\\n I close my eyes and sigh. \"I\u0027ve worried about that myself. But please believe me, he can\u0027t be an impostor. Dozens of times we\u0027ve discussed things only Ray and I knew.\"\\n\\n \"But you do accept you\u0027re dealing with a guy that has his priorities twisted?\"\\n\\n \"Am I? I\u0027ve asked myself that question many times. When you get right down to it, I would do anything to save Kalika. Ray\u0027s her father. Is he so different from me?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s something in your story-- something I can\u0027t put my finger on. I think Ray\u0027s dangerous, and I\u0027d keep an eye on him. But let\u0027s leave that for a moment. Let\u0027s talk about Kalika. How can she be a vampire and not be sensitive to the sun?\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t that sensitive,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Because you\u0027d been a vampire for over five thou?sand years. And still the sun did bother you; it sapped your strength. You say it doesn\u0027t affect her at all?\"\\n\\n \"Not as far as I can tell. She plays out in it.\"\\n\\n \"Does she make any effort to move into the shade?\"\\n\\n \"No. She likes the sun as much as the moon.\"\\n\\n \"Yet she wants human blood,\" Seymour muttered, thinking aloud. \"Hmm. Is she exceptionally strong?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Pretty strong. She must be a vampire.\" Seymour considers. \"What does she look like?\"\\n\\n \"A lot like me, except her features are darker.\"\\n\\n \"You mean she has brown hair, brown eyes?\"\\n\\n \"Her hair is brown, but her eyes are a dark blue.\" I add painfully, \"She\u0027s very pretty. You\u0027d like her.\"\\n\\n \"Not if she wants to drink my blood. Sita, let\u0027s be frank with each other. You\u0027re not superhuman any?more. You\u0027re not going to be able to go around abducting people without getting caught. As far as I can tell, you were lucky with this Eric guy. And how are you going to let him go when you\u0027re through with him? He\u0027ll go straight to the police.\"\\n\\n I bite my lower lip and taste the blood. The flavor gives me no strength. \"I know,\" I say.\\n\\n \"If you know then you\u0027ve got to stop now.\" There are tears pooled in my eyes but I won\u0027t shed them. Not tonight. \"I can\u0027t, Seymour. Ray\u0027s right about one thing. I can\u0027t let her die.\"\\n\\n Seymour speaks gently. \"You know what I\u0027m going to ask next.\"\\n\\n I nod weakly. \"Yes. Does the world need a monster like her? All I can say is, I\u0027m hoping she turns out all right. For godsakes, she was just born. She hasn\u0027t had a chance to show what she\u0027s like.\"\\n\\n \"But by the time she does, it might be too late. You might not be able to stop her.\" He adds carefully, \"But you can stop her now.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m aghast \"I can\u0027t murder my own daughter!\"\\n\\n \"You can stop feeding her. Think what those feedings will cost you and your victims. You\u0027ll need a dozen Erics to keep her satisfied if she\u0027s growing at the rate you say. In fact, she\u0027ll be getting her own Erics soon enough. I know this is painful for you to face, but you should probably end it now.\"\\n\\n I shake my head vigorously. \"I can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n Seymour is sympathetic. \"But then I can\u0027t help you.\" He adds, \"Unless you tell me where you are.\"\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t help for you to see her. \"You\u0027ll just fall in love with her. When she\u0027s not hungry, she\u0027s really very lovely.\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking I\u0027d like to speak to this new and improved Ray.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea. Not now.\"\\n\\n Seymour speaks with feeling. \"You\u0027ve trusted me in the past, Sita. Trust me now. You\u0027re too close to this. You can\u0027t see what\u0027s real. You need me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too dangerous, Seymour. If something happened to you, I\u0027d never forgive myself. Stay where you are, I\u0027ll call you again. And I\u0027ll think about what you\u0027ve said.\"\\n\\n \"Thinking won\u0027t stop her from growing into what she really is.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose we\u0027ll see what that is soon enough.\" We exchange goodbyes. As I leave the house, I think of Eddie Fender\u0027s blood circulating in my lover\u0027s body. And I wonder what blood pumps through Kalika\u0027s veins. What it is capable of doing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-the-last-vampire-4/page-8.html","bookId":2513,"book":{"id":2513,"title":"Phantom (The Last Vampire #4)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Last Vampire #4) \\n The dead alchemist\u0027s experiment has worked.
