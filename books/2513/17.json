{"id":108212,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Arturo\u0027s alchemy of transformation works by having the substance of what one wishes to become vibrate at a high level in one\u0027s aura. To become human, I took Seymour\u0027s blood and placed it--above my head--in a clear vial the sun shone through while I lay on a copper plate surrounded by specially arranged mag?nets and crystals. Only Arturo knew how to use these tools fully. The New Age is still centuries behind his knowledge. The proponents of New Age mysticism hold quartz crystals or amethysts and relax some, but Arturo could use these minerals to attain enlighten?ment, or even immortality. His only weakness was that he strove for immortality with a vampire for a girlfriend. He was a priest and erroneously thought I could give him the equivalent of the blood of Jesus.\\n\\n His blasphemy was his sin, and his eventual ruin. He tried to use me, betrayed me. But he is dead now and I mourn him.\\n\\n To become a vampire again, I need a source of vampire blood.\\n\\n I lied to Seymour, naturally. There is one possible source--Yaksha. Yet I have sunk Yaksha\u0027s body in the sea and will never be able to locate it, not without the powers of a vampire. Still, there is one other possible source of his blood, besides that in his body. Eddie Fender kept Yaksha captive in an ice-cream truck for several weeks, kept him cold and weak. It was from this very ice-cream truck that I eventually rescued Yaksha, who had no legs and hardly any lower torso. He bled in that truck and his blood must still be there, frozen and preserved.\\n\\n But that truck was parked on the street in the vicinity of a warehouse I burned down to kill Eddie and his crew of vampires. That was approximately two months ago. The chances that the truck will still be there are slim. The police will almost certainly have confiscated it, towed it off to some forsaken lot. Yet I hurry to the dirty street in the poor part of town on the off chance that I can uncover a bloody Popsicle. Desperate people do desperate things.\\n\\n And the ice truck is still there. Wow.\\n\\n A homeless man with white hair and a grimy face sits in his rags near the driver\u0027s door. He has a shopping cart loaded with aluminum cans and blankets that look as if they were woven during the Depression. He is thin and bent but he looks up at me with bright eyes as I approach. He sits on the curb, nursing a small carton of milk. I immediately reach for my money. It is his lucky night. I will give him a hundred and tell him to hit the road. But something in his voice gives me reason to pause. His greeting is peculiar.\\n\\n \"You look very nice tonight,\" he says. \"But I know you\u0027re in a hurry.\"\\n\\n I stand above him and glance around. There is no one visible, but it is the middle of the night and this ghetto is a wonderful place to get raped or killed. Last time I was here I had to rough up a couple of cops. They thought I was a hooker, and one of them wanted to arrest me. I study the homeless man.\\n\\n \"How do you know I\u0027m in a hurry?\" I ask.\\n\\n He grins and his smile is much brighter than I would have anticipated. Bright like his eyes even though he is covered in dirt.\\n\\n \"I know a few things,\" he says. \"You want this truck I suppose. I\u0027ve been guarding it for you.\"\\n\\n I laugh softly. \"I appreciate that. I have a horrible craving for an ice-cream bar right now.\"\\n\\n He nods. \"The refrigerator unit still works. I\u0027ve kept it serviced.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m impressed. \"You\u0027re handy with tools?\"\\n\\n \"I have fixed a thing or two in my day.\" He offers me his hand. \"Please help me up. My bones are old and sore, and I have been waiting here for you for such a long time.\"\\n\\n I help him--I don\u0027t mind a little dirt. \"How long have you been here?\"\\n\\n He brushes himself off, but ends up making a worse mess of his torn clothes. He blinks at my question as if I have confused him, although he does not smell of alcohol. He finishes his carton of milk and sets the empty container in his shopping cart.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t rightly know,\" he says finally. \"I think I\u0027ve been here since you were last here.\"\\n\\n I pause, feeling an odd sensation coursing through my body. But I dismiss it. I have too much on my mind to waste precious minutes with an old man in the middle of the night.\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t been here in a couple of months,\" I say, reaching in my pocket. \"Look, can I give you ...\"\\n\\n \"Then I must have been here that long,\" he inter?rupts. \"I knew you\u0027d come back.\"\\n\\n I stop with my hand wrapped around a few twen?ties. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" I say quietly.\\n\\n He grins a crooked grin. \"I don\u0027t need your mon?ey.\" He turns and shuttles up the street. \"You do what you have to do. No one can blame you for not trying hard.\"\\n\\n I stare at him as he fades into the night.\\n\\n Such a strange old guy. He left his shopping cart behind.\\n\\n I wonder what his name was.\\n\\n The rear compartment of the truck is locked, but I break it with a loose brick. Actually, I could have sworn that I broke the lock the last time I entered it. The interior is ice cold as I squeeze inside, a flashlight in my hand.\\n\\n Just inside the door is a puddle of frozen blood.\\n\\n I slip a nail under it and pull up the whole red wafer at once. Shining my flashlight through the frosted glass, I feel a surge of tremendous power. I hold in my hands immortality, and I feel as if Krishna saved this blood just so I\u0027d find it. Back in my own car, I break the ice into small pieces and let them melt in a stainless-steel thermos.\\n\\n Now I must return to Las Vegas. If it were not the middle of the night, I would fly, but driving it will have to be--at least four hours of pushing the speed limit. Also, I have to worry that Arturo\u0027s house is being watched by government agents. From reading the papers, I know the dust has not settled from the nuclear explosion in the desert. They must think I am dead, but will not assume that I am. There is an important difference.\\n\\n The rays of the sun will power my transformation. What is crucial is that I have most of the day to complete the transformation back to becoming a vampire, if it is possible. There is a chance I will end up like Ralphe, a bloodthirsty ghoul. But I have no choice except to risk the alchemist\u0027s ancient experiment. To give up my hard-sought humanity will be bitter, yet I have to admit a part of me craves my old power. It will be nice to confront my daughter one on one and not tremble in my shoes.\\n\\n Yet I intend to tremble, especially if I am a vampire.\\n\\n She will not know until too late who it is she faces. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-the-last-vampire-4/page-17.html","bookId":2513,"book":{"id":2513,"title":"Phantom (The Last Vampire #4)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Last Vampire #4) \\n The dead alchemist\u0027s experiment has worked.
