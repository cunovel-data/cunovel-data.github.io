He shook his head. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Even the great Chen failed you?\"\\n\\n \"He would do nothing. He wants evidence, too. They all want evidence, but anything you offer them is rejected. What they really want is their damned Pump, or their reputation, or their place in history. Chen wants immortality.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want, Pete?\" asked Bronowski, softly.\\n\\n \"Mankind\u0027s safety,\" said Lamont. He looked at the other\u0027s quizzical eyes. \"You don\u0027t believe me?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I believe you. But what do you really want?\"\\n\\n \"Well, then, by God,\" and Lamont brought his hand down flat on the desk before him in a loud slap. \"I want to be right, and that I have, for I am right.\"\\n\\n \"You are sure?\"\\n\\n \"I am sure! And there\u0027s nothing I am worried about, because I intend to win. You know when I left Chen, I came near to despising myself.\"\\n\\n \"You?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I. Why not? I kept thinking: At every turn Hallam stops me. As long as Hallam refutes me everyone has an excuse not to believe me. While Hallam stands like a rock against me, I must fail. Why, then, didn\u0027t I work through him; why didn\u0027t I butter him up, indeed; why didn\u0027t I maneuver him into supporting me instead of needling him into fighting me?\"\\n\\n \"Do you think you could have?\"\\n\\n \"No, never. But in my despair, I thought - well, all sorts of things. That I might go to the Moon, perhaps. Of course, when I first turned him against me there was as yet no question of Earth\u0027s doom, but I took care to make it worse when that question arose. But, as you imply, nothing could have turned him against the Pump.\"\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t seem to despise yourself now.\"\\n\\n \"No. Because my conversation with Chen brought a dividend. It showed me I was wasting time.\"\\n\\n \"So it would seem.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but needlessly. It is not here on Earth that the solution lies. I told Chen that our Sun might blow up but that the para-Sun would not, yet that would not save the para-men, for when our Sun blew up and our end of the Pump halted, so would theirs. They cannot continue without us, do you see?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course I see.\"\\n\\n \"They why don\u0027t we think in the reverse. We can\u0027t continue without them. In which case, who cares whether we stop the Pump or not. Let\u0027s get the para-men to stop.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, but will they?\"\\n\\n \"They said F-E-E-R. And it means they\u0027re afraid. Chen said they feared us; they feared we would stop the Pump; but I don\u0027t believe that for a moment. They\u0027re afraid. I sat silent when Chen made his suggestion. He thought he had me. He was quite wrong. I was only thinking at that moment that we had to get the para-men to stop. And we\u0027ve got to. Mike, I abandon everything, except you. You\u0027re the hope of the world. Get through to them somehow.\"\\n\\n Bronowski laughed, and there was almost a childlike glee in it. \"Pete,\" he said, \"you\u0027re a genius.\"\\n\\n \"Aha. You\u0027ve noticed.\"\\n\\n \"No, I mean it. You guess what I want to say before I can say it. I\u0027ve been sending message after message, using their symbols in a way that I guessed might signify the Pump and using our word as well. And I did my best to gather what information I\u0027ve scrabbled together over many months to use their symbols in a way signifying disapproval, and using an English word again. I had no idea whether I was getting through or was a mile off base and from the fact that I never got an answer, I had little hope.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t tell me that\u0027s what you were trying to do.\"\\n\\n \"Well, this part of the problem is my baby. You take your sweet time explaining para-theory to me.\"\\n\\n \"So what happened?\" \u0027\\n\\n \"So yesterday, I sent off exactly two words, our language. I scrawled: P-U-M-P B-A-D.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And this morning I picked up a return message at last and it was simple enough, and straightforward, too. It went Y-E-S P-U-M-P B-A-D B-A-D B-A-D. Here look at it.\"\\n\\n Lamont\u0027s hand trembled as it held the foil. \"There\u0027s no mistaking that, is there? That\u0027s confirmation, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"It seems so to me. Who will you take this to?\"\\n\\n \"To no one,\" said Lamont decisively. \"I argue no more. They will tell me I faked the message and there\u0027s no point in sitting still for that. Let the para-men stop the Pump and it will stop on our side too and nothing we can do unilaterally will start it up again. The entire Station will then be on fire to prove that I was right and the Pump is dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"How do you figure that?\"\\n\\n \"Because that would be the only way they could keep themselves from being torn apart by a mob demanding the Pump and infuriated at not getting it. . . . Don\u0027t you think so?\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe. But one thing bothers me.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"If the para-men are so convinced that the Pump is dangerous, why haven\u0027t they stopped it already? I took occasion to check awhile ago and the Pump is working swimmingly.\"\\n\\n Lamont frowned. \"Perhaps they don\u0027t want a unilateral stoppage. They consider us their partners and they want a mutual agreement to stop. Don\u0027t you suppose that might be so?\"\\n\\n \"It might. But it might also be that communication is less than perfect; that they don\u0027t quite understand the significance of the words B-A-D. From what I said to them via their symbols, which I might well have twisted utterly, they may think that B-A-D means what we consider G-O-O-D.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s your hope, but there\u0027s no pay-off on hopes.\"\\n\\n \"Mike, just keep on sending messages. Use as many of the words they use as possible and keep ringing the changes. You\u0027re the expert and it\u0027s in your hands. Eventually, they\u0027ll know enough words to say something clear and unmistakable and then we\u0027ll explain that we\u0027re willing to have the Pump stopped.\"\\n\\n \"We lack the authority to make any such statement.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but they won\u0027t know, and in the end we\u0027ll be mankind\u0027s heroes.\"\\n\\n \"Even if they execute us first?\"\\n\\n \"Even so. . . . It\u0027s in your hands, Mike, and I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t take much longer.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-9.html","bookId":1744,"book":{"id":1744,"title":"The Gods Themselves","description":"Storyline: Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.
