{"id":70590,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Odeen - Tri - 6b Odeen came. He had been flowing faster than ever he had flowed before. He had been following Tritt\u0027s sharp new-baby sense perception, but now he was close enough for his own blunter senses to detect her nearness. He could on his own account feel the flickering and fading consciousness of Dua, and he raced forward while Tritt did his best to clump along, gasping and calling, \"Faster - faster - \" Odeen found her in a state of collapse, scarcely alive, smaller than he had ever seen an adult Emotional. \"Tritt,\" he said, \"bring the battery here. No - no - don\u0027t try to carry her. She\u0027s too thin to carry. Hurry. If she sinks into the floor - \" The Hard Ones began to gather. They were late, of course, with their inability to sense other life-forms at a distance. If it had depended only on them, it would have been too late to save her. She would not have passed on; she would truly have been destroyed - and - and more than she knew would have been destroyed with her. Now, as she was slowly gathering life out of the energy supply, the Hard Ones stood silently near them. Odeen rose; a new Odeen who knew what was happening exactly. Imperiously, he ordered them away with an angry gesture - and they left. Silently. Without objection. Dua stirred. Tritt said, \"Is she all right, Odeen?\" \"Quiet, Tritt,\" said Odeen. \"Dua?\" \"Odeen?\" She stirred, spoke in a whisper. \"I thought I had passed on.\" \"Not yet, Dua. Not yet. But first you must eat and rest.\" \"Is Tritt here, too?\" \"Here I am, Dua,\" said Tritt. \"Don\u0027t try to bring me back,\" said Dua. \"It\u0027s over, I\u0027ve done what I wanted to do. The Positron Pump will - will stop soon, I\u0027m sure. The Hard Ones will continue to need Soft Ones and they will take care of you two, or at least the children.\" Odeen didn\u0027t say anything. He kept Tritt from saying anything, either. He let the radiation pour slowly into Dua, very slowly. He stopped at times to let her rest a bit, then he started again. She began to mutter, \"Enough. Enough.\" Her substance was writhing more strongly. Still he fed her. Finally, he spoke. He said, \"Dua, you were wrong. We are not machines. I know exactly what we are,. I would have come to you sooner, if I had found out earlier, but I didn\u0027t know till Losten begged me to think. And I did; very hard; and even so it is almost premature.\" Dua moaned and Odeen stopped for a while. He said, \"Listen, Dua. There is a single species of life. The Hard Ones are the only living things in the world. You gathered that, and so far you were right. But that doesn\u0027t mean the Soft Ones aren\u0027t alive; it merely means we are part of the same single species. The Soft Ones are the immature forms of the Hard Ones. We are first children as Soft Ones, then adults as Soft Ones, then Hard Ones. Do you understand?\" Tritt said, in soft confusion, \"What? What?\" Odeen said, \"Not now, Tritt. Not now. You\u0027ll understand, too, but this is for Dua.\" He kept watching Dua, who was gaining opalescence. He said, \"Listen, Dua, whenever we melt, whenever the triad melts, we become a Hard One. The Hard One is three-in-one, which is why he is hard. During the time of unconsciousness in melting we are a Hard One. But it is only temporary, and we can never remember the period afterward. We can never stay a Hard One long; we must come back. But all through our life we keep developing, with certain key stages marking it off. Each baby born marks a key stage. With the birth of the third, the Emotional, there comes the possibility of the final stage, where the Rational\u0027s mind by itself, without the other two, can remember those flashes of Hard One existence. Then, and only then, he can guide a perfect melt that will form the Hard One forever, so that the triad can live a new and unified life of learning and intellect. I told you that passing on was like being born again. I was groping then for something I did not quite understand, but now I know.\" Dua was looking at him, trying to smile. She said, \"How can you pretend to believe that, Odeen? If that were so, wouldn\u0027t the Hard Ones have told you long ago; told all of us?\" \"They couldn\u0027t, Dua. There was a time, long ages ago, when melting was just a putting together of the atoms of bodies. But evolution slowly developed minds. Listen to me, Dua; melting is a putting together of the minds, too, and that\u0027s much harder, much more delicate. To put it together properly and permanently, just so, the Rational must reach a certain pitch in development. That pitch is reached when he finds out, for himself, what it\u0027s all about: when his mind is finally keen enough to remember what has happened in all those temporary unions during melting. If the Rational were told, that development would be aborted and the time of the perfect melt could not be determined. The Hard One would form imperfectly. When Losten pleaded with me to think, he was taking a great chance. Even that may have been - I hope not - \"For it\u0027s especially true in our case, Dua. For many generations, the Hard Ones have been combining triads with great care to form particularly advanced Hard Ones and our triad was the best they\u0027d ever obtained. Especially you, Dua. Especially you. Losten was once the triad whose baby-mid you were. Part of him was your Parental. He knew you. He brought you to Tritt and me.\" Dua sat up. Her voice was almost normal. \"Odeen! Are you making all this up to soothe me?\" Tritt broke in. \"No, Dua. I feel it, too. I feel it, too. I don\u0027t know what exactly, but I feel it.\" \"He does, Dua,\" said Odeen. \"You will, too. Aren\u0027t you beginning to recall being a Hard One during our melt? Don\u0027t you want to melt now? One last time? One last time?\" He lifted her. There was a feverishness about her, and though she struggled a bit, she was thinning. \"If what you say is true, Odeen,\" she gasped. \"If we are to be a Hard One; then it seems to me you are saying we\u0027ll be an important one. Is that so?\" \"The most important. The best who was ever formed. I mean that . . . Tritt, over there. It\u0027s not good-by, Tritt. We\u0027ll be together, as we always wanted to be. Dua, too. You, too, Dua.\" Dua said, \"Then we can make Estwald understand the Pump can\u0027t continue. We\u0027ll force - \" The melting was beginning. One by one, the Hard Ones were entering again at the crucial moment. Odeen saw them imperfectly, for he was beginning to melt into Dua. It was not like the other times; no sharp ecstasy; just a smooth, cool, utterly peaceful movement. He could feel himself become partly Dua, and all the world seemed pouring into his/her sharpening senses. The Positron Pumps were still going - he/she could tell - why were they still going? He was Tritt, too, and a keen sharp sense of bitter loss filled his/her/his mind. Oh, my babies - And he cried out, one last cry under the consciousness of Odeen, except that somehow it was the cry of Dua. \"No, we can\u0027t stop Estwald. We are Estwald. We - \" The cry that was Dua\u0027s and yet not Dua\u0027s stopped and there was no longer any Dua; nor would there ever be Dua again. Nor Odeen. Nor Tritt. 7abc Estwald stepped forth and said sadly to the waiting Hard Ones, by way of vibrating air waves, \"I am permanently with you now, and there is much to do - \" 3 . . . contend in vain? 1 Selene Lindstrom smiled brightly and walked with the light springy touch that was startling when first seen by the tourists, but was soon recognized as having a grace of its own. \"It\u0027s time for lunch,\" she said, cheerfully. \"All home-grown, ladies and gentlemen. You may not be used to the taste, but it\u0027s all nourishing. . . . Right here, sir. You won\u0027t mind sitting with the ladies, I know . . . One moment. There will be seats for all. . . . Sorry, there will be a choice on the beverage, but not on the main course. That will be veal. . . . No, no. Artificial flavor and texture, but it\u0027s really quite good.\" Then she sat down herself, with a slight sigh and an even slighter wavering of her pleasant expression. One of the group sat down across from her, \"Do you mind?\" he asked. She looked at him, quickly, penetrating. She had the faculty of making quick judgments, of course, and he did not seem troublesome. She said, \"Not at all. But aren\u0027t you with someone in this group?\" He shook his head. \"No. I\u0027m alone. Even if that were not the case, Earthies are no great thrill to me.\" She looked at him again. He was fiftyish and there was\u0027 a weary look about him which only his bright, inquisitive eyes seemed to belie. He had the unmistakable look of the Earthman, laden down with gravity. She said, \" \u0027Earthie\u0027 is a Moon-expression, and not a very nice one.\" \"I\u0027m from Earth,\" he said, \"so I can use it without offense, I hope. Unless you object.\" Selene shrugged as though to say: Please yourself. She had the faintly oriental look about the eyes so many of the Moon-girls had, but her hair was the color of honey and her nose was prominent. She was undeniably attractive without being in any way classically beautiful. The Earthman was staring at the nameplate she wore on the blouse covering the upper slope of her high, not-too-large left breast. She decided it was really the name-plate he was looking at, not the breast, though the blouse was semi-transparent when it caught the light at a particular angle and there was no garment beneath it. He said, \"Are there many Selenes here?\" \"Oh, yes. Hundreds, I think. Also Cynthias, Dianas, and Artemises. Selene is a little tiresome. Half the Selenes I know are called \u0027Silly\u0027 and the other half \u0027Lena.\u0027 \" \"Which are you?\" \"Neither. I am Selene, all three syllables. SELL-uh-nee,\" she said, coming down heavily on the first syllable, \"to those who use my first name at all.\" There was a small smile on the Earthman\u0027s face that sat there as though he weren\u0027t quite used to it. He said, \"And what if anyone asks you if you sell any, Selene?\" \"They never ask me that again!\" she said, firmly. \"But do they ask you?\" \"There are fools always.\" A waitress had reached their table and had placed the dishes before them with quick, smooth motions. The Earthman was visibly impressed. He said to the waitress, \"You make them seem to float down.\" The waitress smiled and moved on. Selene said, \"Don\u0027t you try to do the same. She\u0027s used to the gravity and can handle it.\" \"And if I try, I\u0027ll drop everything? Isthat it?\" \"You\u0027ll make a gorgeous mess,\" she said, \"Well, I won\u0027t try.\" \"There\u0027s a good chance someone will before long, and the plate will flow down to the floor and they\u0027ll grab for it and miss, and ten to one knock themselves out of their chair. I\u0027d warn them, but it never helps and they\u0027re just all the more embarrassed. Everyone else will laugh - the tourists, that is, because the rest of us have seen it too often to find it funny and because it\u0027s just a cleanup job.\" The Earthman was lifting his fork carefully. \"I see what you mean. Even the simplest motions seem queer.\" \"Actually, you get used to it quickly enough. At least to little things like eating. Walking is harder. I never saw an Earthman run efficiently out here. Not really efficiently.\" For a while they ate in silence. Then he said, \"What does the L. stand for?\" He was looking at her nameplate again. It said, \"Selene Lindstrom L.\" \"It just means Luna,\" she said, rather indifferently, \"to distinguish me from the immigrants. I was born here.\" \"Really?\" \u0027That\u0027s nothing to be surprised about. We\u0027ve had a working society here for over half a century. Don\u0027t you think babies are born here? We have people here who were born here and are grandparents.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Thirty-two,\" she said. He looked startled, then mumbled, \"Of course.\" Selene raised her eyebrows. \"You mean you understand? Most Earthmen have to have it explained.\" The Earthman said, \"I know enough to know that most of the visible signs of aging are the result of the inexorable victory of gravity over tissue - the sagging of cheek and the drooping of breast. With the Moon\u0027s gravity one-sixth that of Earth, it isn\u0027t really hard to understand that people will stay young-looking.\" Selene said, \"Only young-looking. It doesn\u0027t mean we have immortality here. The life-span is about that of Earth, but most of us are more comfortable in old age.\" \"That\u0027s not to be dismissed. . . . Of course, there are penalties, I suppose.\" He had just taken his first sip of his coffee. \"You have to drink this - \" He paused for a word and must have discarded it, for he used none. \"We could import food and beverages from Earth,\" she said, amused, \"but only enough to feed a fraction of us a fraction of the time. There\u0027d be no point to that when we can use the space for more vital items. Besides, we\u0027re used to this crud. . . . Or were you going to use a still stronger word?\" \"Not for the coffee,\" he said. \"I was going to save that for the food. But crud will do . . . Tell me,\u0027 Miss Lindstrom. I didn\u0027t see any mention on the tour itinerary of the proton synchrotron.\" \"The proton synchrotron?\" She was finishing her coffee and her eyes were beginning to slide round the room, as though estimating the moment for getting them all to their feet again. \"That\u0027s Terrestrial property and it\u0027s not open to tourists.\" \"You mean that it\u0027s off-limits to Lunarites.\" \"Oh, no. Nothing of the sort. Most of its staff are Lunarites. It\u0027s just that it\u0027s the Terrestrial government that sets the rules. No tourists.\" \"I\u0027d love to see it,\" he said. She said, \"I\u0027m sure you would . . . You\u0027ve brought me luck; not one item of food, not one blessed man or woman has hit the floor.\" She got to her feet and said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we\u0027ll be leaving in about ten minutes. Please leave the plates where they are. There are rest rooms for those who wish to use them and then we will visit the food-processing plants where meals such as you have just eaten are made possible.\" 2 Selene\u0027s quarters were small, of course, and compact; but they were intricate. The windows were panoramic; star scenes that changed slowly and very randomly, never having any relationship to any real constellation. Each of the three windows could be made to undergo telescopic magnification, when Selene so desired. Barren Neville hated that part of it. He would tend to turn it off rather savagely and say, \"How can you stand it? You\u0027re the only one I know who has the bad taste to do such a thing. It\u0027s not as though these nebulae and star clusters exist, even.\" And Selene would shrug, coolly, and say, \"What\u0027s existence? How do you know the ones out there exist? Besides it gives me a sensation of freedom and motion. May I have that in my own quarters if I choose?\" Then Neville would mumble something and make a halfhearted attempt to restore the controls to where he had found them and Selene would say, \"Let it go!\" The furniture was in smooth curves, and the walls were abstractly decorated in low-key, unobtrusive colors. Nowhere was there any representation of anything that might be considered a living thing. \"Living things are Earth,\" Selene would say, \"not the Moon.\" Now, when she entered, she found, as so often, Neville there; Barron Neville, resting on the flimsy couch with one sandal on. The other lay beside him where it had dropped, and there Was a line of red marks on his abdomen, just over his umbilicus, where he had been meditatively scratching. She said, \"Get us some coffee, won\u0027t you, Barron?\" and slipped out of her own clothes in a long, graceful wiggle accompanied by a sigh of relief, letting them drop to the ground and then kicking them into the corner with one toe. \"What a relief to get out of them,\" she said. \"It\u0027s the worst part of the job, having to dress like an Earthie.\" Neville was in the kitchen corner. He paid no attention; he had heard it before. He said, \"What\u0027s wrong with your water supply? It\u0027s way down.\" \"Is it?\" she asked. \"Well, I\u0027ve been overusing, I suppose. Just be patient.\" \"Any trouble, today?\" Selene shrugged. \"No. Very run of the mill. Just the usual bit about watching them teetering along and pretending they don\u0027t hate the food, and knowing they\u0027re wondering if they\u0027ll be asked to take off their clothes, I shouldn\u0027t be surprised. . . . Disgusting possibility.\" \"Are you taking up prudery?\" He brought the two small cups of coffee to the table. \"In this case prudery is required. They\u0027re wrinkled, sagging, paunchy, and full of germs. I don\u0027t care what the quarantine regulations are like; they\u0027re full of germs . . . What\u0027s new on your side?\" Barron shook his head. He was heavily-built for a Lunarite, and there was an almost-sullen narrowing of his eyes that had become a built-in feature. Except for that his features were even, and remarkably handsome, Selene thought. He said, \"Nothing startling. We\u0027re still waiting out the change in Commissioner. We\u0027ll have to see what this Gottstein is like.\" \"Can he make difficulties?\" \"None more than are being made. After all, what can they do? They can\u0027t infiltrate. You can\u0027t disguise an Earthie as a Lunarite.\" But he looked uneasy just the same. Selene sipped at her coffee and looked at him shrewdly. \"Some Lunarites might be Earthies inside.\" \"Yes, and I\u0027d like to know which. Sometimes I don\u0027t think I can trust - Oh, well. I\u0027m wasting incredible amounts of time with my synchrotron project and getting nowhere. I\u0027m having no luck with priorities.\" \"They probably don\u0027t trust you, and I don\u0027t blame them. If only you didn\u0027t slink around so conspiratorially.\" \"I do no such thing. It would give me great pleasure to walk out of the synchrotron room and never return, but then they - would become suspicious. . . . If you\u0027ve been raising hell with your water supply, Selene, I suppose we can\u0027t have a second cup.\" \"No, we can\u0027t. But if it conies to that, you\u0027ve been helping me waste water. You\u0027ve had two showers here in the last week.\" \"I\u0027ll give you a water credit. I didn\u0027t know you were counting.\" \"I\u0027m not counting - my water level is.\" She finished her own cup of coffee and stared at its emptiness thoughtfully. She said, \"They always make faces over it. The tourists do. And I can never figure out why, either. It tastes fine to me. Did you ever taste Earth-coffee, Barron?\" \"No,\" he said, briefly. \"I did. Once. Some tourist had smuggled in packets\u0027 of what he called instant coffee. He offered me some in exchange for you-know-what. Seemed to think it was an even trade.\" \"And you had some?\" \"I was curious. It was bitter and metallic. I hated it. Then I told him that miscegenation was against Lunarite custom and he turned rather bitter and metallic himself.\" \"You never told me this. He didn\u0027t try anything, did he?\" \"It\u0027s not particularly your business, is it? And, no, he didn\u0027t try anything. If he had tried, at the wrong gravity for him, I\u0027d have bounced him from here to corridor 1.\" Then she went on. \"Oh, yes. I picked up another Earthie today. Insisted on sitting with me.\" \"And what did he offer you in exchange for the screwing you so delicately call you-know-what?\" \"Just sat there.\" \"And stared at your breasts?\" \"They\u0027re there to be stared at, but actually he didn\u0027t He stared at my nameplate . . . Besides, what\u0027s it to you what he fantasied? Fantasies are free and I don\u0027t have to fulfill them. What do you think I\u0027m fantasying? Bed with an Earthman? With all the action you would expect of someone trying to handle a gravitational field he isn\u0027t used to? I wouldn\u0027t say it hasn\u0027t been done, but not by me, and not that I\u0027ve ever heard any good of it. Is that settled? Can I get back to the Earthie? Who\u0027s nearly fifty? And who obviously wasn\u0027t terrifically handsome even when he was twenty? . . . Interesting appearance, though; I\u0027ll grant him that.\" \"All right. I can do without a thumbnail sketch. What about him?\" \"He asked about the proton synchrotron!\" Neville rose to his feet, swaying a little as was almost inevitable after quick movement at low gravity. \"What did he ask about the synchrotron?\" \"Nothing. Why are you so excited? You asked me to tell you anything that was out of the way with any tourist at any time and this seemed out of the way. No one ever asked me about the synchrotron before.\" \"All right\" He paused a little, then in a normal voice, said, \"Why was he interested in the synchrotron?\" Selene said, \"I haven\u0027t the faintest idea. He just asked if he could see it. It could be that he\u0027s a tourist with an interest in science. For all I know, it was just a ploy to get me interested in him.\" \"And I suppose you are. What\u0027s his name?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t ask him.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I\u0027m not interested in him. Which way do you want it to be? Besides, his asking shows he\u0027s a tourist. If he were a physicist, he wouldn\u0027t have to ask. He\u0027s be there.\" \"My dear Selene,\" said Neville. \"Let me spell it out. Under the present circumstances, anyone who asks to see the proton synchrotron is a peculiar fellow we want to know about. And why should he ask you?\" He walked hastily to the other end of the room and back as though wearing off a little energy. Then he said, \"You\u0027re the expert at that nonsense. Do you find him of interest?\" \"Sexually?\" \"You know what I mean. Don\u0027t play games, Selene.\" Selene said with clear reluctance. \"He\u0027s interesting, even disturbing. But I don\u0027t know why. He said nothing. He did nothing.\" \"Interesting and disturbing, is he? Then you will see him again.\" \"And do what?\" \"How do I know? That\u0027s your bit. Find out his name. Find out anything else you can. You\u0027ve got some brains, so use them on a little practical nosiness for a change.\" \"Oh, well,\" she said, \"orders from on high. All right.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-17.html","bookId":1744,"book":{"id":1744,"title":"The Gods Themselves","description":"Storyline: Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.
