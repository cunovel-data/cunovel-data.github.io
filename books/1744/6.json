So I take the next step.\"\\n\\n \"And what is that?\" said Bronowski.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to see Senator Burt.\"\\n\\n \"You mean the head of the Committee on Technology and the Environment?\"\\n\\n \"The same. You\u0027ve heard of him, then.\"\\n\\n \"Who hasn\u0027t. But where\u0027s the point, Pete. What have you got that would interest him? It\u0027s not the translation. Pete, I\u0027m asking you once again. What have you got on your mind?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t explain. You don\u0027t know para-theory.\"\\n\\n \"Does Senator Burt?\"\\n\\n \"More than you, I think.\"\\n\\n Bronowski pointed his finger. \"Pete, let\u0027s not kid around. Maybe I know things you don\u0027t. We can\u0027t work together if we work against each other. Either I\u0027m a member of this little two-man corporation or I\u0027m not. You tell me what\u0027s on your mind, and I\u0027ll tell you something in exchange. Otherwise, let\u0027s stop this altogether.\"\\n\\n Lamont shrugged. \"All right. If you want it, I\u0027ll give it to you. Now that I\u0027ve got it past Hallam, maybe it\u0027s just as well. The point is that the Electron Pump is transferring natural law. In the para-Universe, the strong interaction is a hundred times stronger than it is here, which means that nuclear fission is much more likely here than there, and nuclear fusion is much more likely there than here. If the Electron Pump keeps on long enough, there will be a final equilibrium in which the strong nuclear interaction will be equally strong in both Universes, and be at a figure about ten times what it is here now and one-tenth what it is there now.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t anyone know this?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure, everyone knew it. It was obvious almost from the start. Even Hallam can see it. That\u0027s what got the bastard so excited. I started telling him this in detail as though I didn\u0027t think he had ever heard it before and he blew up.\"\\n\\n \"But what\u0027s the point then? Is there danger in the interaction becoming intermediate?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think anything. When will it become intermediate?\"\\n\\n \"At the present rate, 10^30 years or so.\"\\n\\n \"How long is that?\"\\n\\n \"Long enough for a trillion trillion Universes like this one to be born, live, grow old, and die, one after the other.\"\\n\\n \"Oh blazes, Pete. What odds does it make then?\"\\n\\n \"Because to reach that figure,\" said Lamont, slowly and carefully, \"which is the official one, certain assumptions were made which I think were wrong. And if certain other assumptions are made, which I think are right, we\u0027re in trouble now.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of trouble?\"\\n\\n \"Suppose the Earth turned into a whiff of gas in a period of about five minutes. Would you consider that trouble?\"\\n\\n \"Because of the Pumping?\"\\n\\n \"Because of the Pumping!\"\\n\\n \"And how about the world of the para-men? Would they be in danger, too?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure of it. A different danger, but danger.\"\\n\\n Bronowski stood up and began pacing. He wore his brown hair thick and long in what had once been called a Buster Brown. Now he was clutching at it. He said, \"If the para-men are more intelligent than we are, would they be running the Pump? Surely they would know it was dangerous, before we did.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve thought of that,\" said Lamont \"What I guess is that they\u0027ve started Pumping for the first time and they, like us, got the process started for the apparent good it would bring and worried about consequences later.\"\\n\\n \"But you say you know the consequences now. Would they be slower than you were?\"\\n\\n \"It depends on if and when they look for those consequences. The Pump is too attractive to try to spoil, I wouldn\u0027t have looked myself if I hadn\u0027t - But what\u0027s on your mind, Mike?\"\\n\\n Bronowski stopped his pacing, looked full at Lamont, and said, \"I think we\u0027ve got something.\"\\n\\n Lamont looked at him wildly, then leaped forward to seize the other\u0027s sleeve. \"With the para-symbols? Tell me, Mike!\"\\n\\n \"It was while you were with Hallam. While you were actually with Hallam. I haven\u0027t known exactly what to do about it, because I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on. And now - \"\\n\\n \"And now?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m still not sure. One of their foils came through, with four symbols . . .\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \". . . in the Latin alphabet. And it can be pronounced.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Here it is.\"\\n\\n Bronowski produced the foil with the air of a conjurer. Incised on it, quite different from the delicate and intricate spirals and differential glistenings of the para-symbols, were four broad, childlike letters: F-E-E-R.\\n\\n \"What do you suppose that means?\" asked Lamont, blankly.\\n\\n \"So far all I\u0027ve been able to think of is that it\u0027s F-E-A-R misspelled.\"\\n\\n \"Is that why you were cross-examining me? You thought someone on the other side was experiencing fear?\"\\n\\n \"And I thought it might have some connection with your own obviously increasing excitement over the last month. Frankly, Pete, I didn\u0027t like being kept in the dark.0\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Now let\u0027s not jump to conclusions. You\u0027re the one with experience with fragmentary messages. Wouldn\u0027t you say that the para-men were beginning to experience fear concerning the Electron Pump?\"\\n\\n \"Not necessarily at all,\" said Bronowski. \"I don\u0027t know how much they can sense of this Universe. If they can sense the tungsten we lay out for them; if they can sense our presence; perhaps they are sensing our state of mind. Perhaps they are trying to reassure us; telling us there is no reason to fear.\"\\n\\n \"Then why don\u0027t they say N-O F-E-E-R.\"\\n\\n \"Because they don\u0027t know our language that well yet.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm. Then I can\u0027t take it to Burt.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s ambiguous. In fact, I wouldn\u0027t go to Burt till we get something more from the other side. Who knows what they\u0027re trying to say.\"\\n\\n \"No, I can\u0027t wait, Mike. I know I\u0027m right, and we have no time.\"\\n\\n \"All right, but if you see Burt you\u0027ll be burning your bridges. Your colleagues will never forgive you. Have you thought of talking to the physicists here? You can\u0027t put pressure on Hallam on your own, but a whole group of you - \"\\n\\n Lamont shook his head vigorously, \"Not at all. The men at this station survive by virtue of their jellyfish quality. There isn\u0027t one who would stand against him. Trying to rally the others to put pressure on Hallam would be like asking strands of cooked spaghetti to come to attention.\"\\n\\n Bronowski\u0027s soft face looked unwontedly grim. \"You may be right.\"\\n\\n \"I know I\u0027m right,\" said Lamont, just as grimly. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-6.html","bookId":1744,"book":{"id":1744,"title":"The Gods Themselves","description":"Storyline: Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.
