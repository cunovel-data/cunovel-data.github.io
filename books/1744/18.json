There was no space on the Moon, not even for Terrestrial officials; no luxurious waste, even as a symbol of the home planet. Nor, for that matter, was there any way of changing the overwhelming fact about the Moon - that it was underground at low gravity - even for the greatest Earthman who ever lived.\\n\\n \"Man is still the creature of his environment,\" sighed Luiz Montez. \"I\u0027ve been two years on the Moon and there have been times when I have been tempted to stay on but - I\u0027m getting on in years. I\u0027ve just passed my fortieth and if I intend ever to go back to Earth, it had better be now. Any older and I won\u0027t be able to readjust to full-gravity.\"\\n\\n Konrad Gottstein was only thirty-four and looked, if anything, younger. He had a wide, round, large-featured face, the kind of face one didn\u0027t see among the Lunarites, the kind of face that was something they would draw as part of an Earthie caricature. He was not heavily-built - it did not pay to send heavily-built Earthmen to the Moon - and his head seemed too large for his body.\\n\\n He said (and he spoke Planetary Standard with a perceptibly different accent from that of Montez), \"You sound apologetic,\"\\n\\n \"I am. I am,\" said Montez. Where Gottstein\u0027s face was intrinsically good-natured in appearance, the long thin lines of Montez\u0027 face were almost comically tragic. \"I am apologetic in both senses. I am embarrassed to be leaving the Moon, since it is an attractive world filled with excitement. And I am embarrassed about the embarrassment; ashamed that I should be reluctant to take up Earth\u0027s\\n\\n burden - gravity and all.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I imagine taking back the other five-sixths will be hard,\" said Gottstein. \"I\u0027ve been on the Moon only a few days and already I feel that one-sixth g is perfectly fine.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t feel that when the constipation starts and you start living on mineral oil,\" said Montez with a sigh, \"but that will pass . . . And don\u0027t think you can imitate the light gazelle just because you feel light. There\u0027s an art to it.\"\\n\\n \"So I understand.\"\\n\\n \"So you think you understand, Gottstein. You haven\u0027t seen the kangaroo walk, have you?\"\\n\\n \"On television.\"\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t really give you the feel of it. You have to try it. It\u0027s the proper mode for crossing level lunar surface at high speed. The feet move together backward and launch you on what would be a simple broad jump on Earth. While you\u0027re in mid-air, they come forward; begin moving back just before they hit the ground again; keep you launched; and so on. The motion seems slow by Earth standards with only a low gravity whipping you on, but each leap is in excess of twenty feet and the amount of muscular effort required to keep you in the air - if there were air - is minimal. The sensation is like flying - \"\\n\\n \"Have you tried it? Can you do it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve tried it, but no Earthman can really do it. I\u0027ve kept it up for as many as five leaps in a row, enough to get the sensation; just enough to want to do more, but then there is the inevitable miscalculation, a loss of synchronization, and you tumble and slide for a quarter of a mile. The Lunarites are polite and never laugh at you. Of course, it\u0027s easy for them. They start as children and pick it up at once without trouble.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s their world,\" said Gottstein, chuckling. \"Think how they\u0027d be on Earth.\"\\n\\n \"They wouldn\u0027t be on Earth. They can\u0027t. I suppose that\u0027s an advantage on our side. We can be either on Moon or on Earth, They can live only on the Moon. We tend to forget that because we confuse the Lunarites with Immies.\"\\n\\n \"With what?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what they call the Earth-immigrants; those who live on the Moon more or less permanently but were born and raised on the Earth. The immigrants can, of course, return to the Earth, but the real Lunarites have neither the bones nor the muscles to withstand the Earth\u0027s gravity. There were some tragedies in that respect in the Moon\u0027s early history.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. People who returned with their Moon-born children. We tend to forget. We\u0027ve had our own Crisis and a-few dying children don\u0027t seem important in the light of the huge casualties of the late Twentieth and all that followed. Here on the Moon, though, every dead Lunarite who succumbed to the gravity of Earth is remembered. . . . It helps them feel a world apart, I think.\"\\n\\n Gottstein said, \"I thought I had been thoroughly briefed on Earth, but it seems I will still have a lot to learn.\"\\n\\n \"Impossible to learn everything about the Moon from a post on Earth, so I have left you a full report as my predecessor did for me. You\u0027ll find the Moon fascinating and, in some ways, excruciating. I doubt that you\u0027ve eaten Lunar rations on Earth and if you\u0027re going by description only, you will not be prepared for the reality . . . But you\u0027ll have to learn to like it. It\u0027s bad policy to ship Earth-items here. We\u0027ve got to eat and drink the local products.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been doing it for two years. I guess I\u0027ll survive,\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve not been doing it steadily. There are periodic furloughs to Earth. Those are obligatory, whether you want them or not. They\u0027ve told you that, I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Gottstein.\\n\\n \"Despite any exercises you do here, you will have to subject yourself to full gravity now and then just to remind your bones and muscles what it\u0027s like. And when you\u0027re on Earth, you\u0027ll eat. And occasionally, some food is smuggled Gottstein said, \"My luggage was carefully inspected, of course, but it turned out there was a can of corned beef in my coat pocket. I had overlooked it. So did they.\"\\n\\n Montez smiled slowly and said, hesitantly, \"I suspect you are now going to offer to share it.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Gottstein, judiciously, wrinkling his large button nose. \"I was going to say with all the tragic nobility I could muster, \u0027Here, Montez, have it all! Thy need is greater than mine.\u0027 \" He stumbled a bit in trying to say this, since he rarely used second person singular in Planetary Standard.\\n\\n Montez smiled more broadly, and then let it vanish. He shook his head. \"No. In a week, I\u0027ll have all the Earth-food I can eat. You won\u0027t. Your mouthfuls will be few in the next few years and you will spend too much time regretting your present generosity. You keep it all. . . . I insist. I would but be earning your hatred ex post facto.\"\\n\\n He seemed serious, his hand on the other\u0027s shoulder, his eyes looking straight into Gottstein\u0027s. \"Besides,\" he said, \"there is something I want to talk to you about that I\u0027ve been putting off because I don\u0027t know how to approach it and this food would be an excuse for further sidetracking.\"\\n\\n Gottstein put away the Earth-can at once. There was no way in which his face could match the other\u0027s seriousness, but his voice was grave and steady, \"Is there something you could not put into your dispatches, Montez?\"\\n\\n \"There was something I tried to put in, Gottstein, but between my not knowing how to phrase it and Earth\u0027s reluctance to grasp my meaning, we ended up not communicating. You may do better. I hope you do. One of the reasons I have not asked to have my tour of duty extended is that I can no longer take the responsibility of my failure to communicate.\"\\n\\n \"You make it sound serious.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I could make it sound serious. Frankly, it sounds silly. There are only some ten thousand people in the Lunar colony. Rather less than half are native Lunarites. They\u0027re hampered by an insufficiency of resources, an insufficiency of space, a harsh world, and yet - and yet - \"\\n\\n \"And yet?\" said Gottstein, encouragingly.\\n\\n \"There is something going on here - I don\u0027t know exactly what - which may be dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"How can it be dangerous? What can they do? Make war against the Earth?\" Gottstein\u0027s face trembled on the brink of a smile-crease.\\n\\n \"No, no. It\u0027s more subtle than that.\" Montez passed his hand over his face, rubbing his eyes petulantly. \"Let me be frank with you. Earth has lost its nerve.\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"Well, what would you call it? Just about the time the Lunar colony was being established, Earth went through the Great Crisis. I don\u0027t have to tell you about that.\"\u0027\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t,\" said Gottstein, with distaste.\\n\\n \"The population is two billion now from its six billion peak.\"\\n\\n \"Earth is much better for that, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, undoubtedly, though I wish there had been a better way of achieving the drop . . . But it\u0027s left behind a permanent distrust of technology; a vast inertia; a lack of desire to risk change because of the possible side-effects. Great and possibly dangerous efforts have been abandoned because the danger was feared more than greatness was desired.\"\\n\\n \"I take it you refer to the program on genetic engineering.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the most spectacular case of course, but not the only one,\" said Montez, bitterly.\\n\\n \"Frankly, I can\u0027t get excited over the abandonment of genetic engineering. It was a tissue of failures.\"\\n\\n \"We lost our chance at intuitionism.\"\\n\\n \"There has never been any evidence that intuitionism is desirable, and considerable indications of its undesirability . . . Besides what about the Lunar colony itself? This certainly is no indication of stagnation on Earth.\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" said Montez, vigorously. \"The Lunar colony is a hangover, a last remnant of the period before the Crisis; something that was carried through as a last sad forward\\n\\n thrust of mankind before the great retreat.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s too dramatic, Montez,\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so. The Earth has retreated. Mankind has retreated, everywhere but on the Moon. The Lunar colony is man\u0027s frontier not just physically, but psychologically, too. Here is a world that doesn\u0027t have a web of life to disrupt; that doesn\u0027t have a complex environment in delicate balance to upset. Everything on the Moon that is of any use to man is man-made. The Moon is a world constructed by man from the start and out of basics. There is no past.\"\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n \"On Earth, we are unmanned by our longing for a pastoral past that never really existed; and that, if it had existed, could never exist again. In some respects, much of the ecology was disrupted in the Crisis and we are making do with the remnants so that we are frightened, always frightened . . . On the Moon, there is no past to long for or dream about. There is no direction but forward.\"\\n\\n Montez seemed to be catching fire with his own words. He said, \"Gottstein, I have watched it for two years; you will watch it for at least that much longer. There is a fire here on the Moon; a restless burning. They expand in every direction. They expand physically. Every month, new corridors are bored, new living quarters established, a new population potential made room for. They expand as far as resources are concerned. They find new construction materials, new water sources, new lodes of specialized minerals. They expand their sun-power battery-banks, enlarge their electronics factories. . . . I suppose you know that these ten thousand people here on the Moon are now the major source for Earth\u0027s supply of mini-electronic devices and fine biochemicals.\"\\n\\n \"I know they\u0027re an important source.\"\\n\\n \"Earth lies to itself for comfort\u0027s sake. The Moon is the major source. At the present rate, it may become the sole source in the near future . . . It\u0027s growing intellectually, too. Gottstein, I imagine there isn\u0027t a bright science-oriented youngster on Earth who doesn\u0027t vaguely - or perhaps not so vaguely - dream of going, to the Moon one day. With Earth in retreat from technology, the Moon is where the action is.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re referring to the proton synchrotron, I suppose?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one example. When was the last new synchrotron built on Earth? But it\u0027s just the biggest and most dramatic item; not the only or even the most important. If you want to know the most important scientific device on the Moon - \"\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Something so secret I haven\u0027t been told?\"\\n\\n \"No, something so obvious that no one seems to notice. It\u0027s the ten thousand brains here. The ten thousand best human brains there are. The only close-knit group of ten thousand human brains that are, in principle and by emotion, science-oriented.\"\\n\\n Gottstein moved restlessly and tried to shift his chair\u0027s position. It was bolted to the floor and wouldn\u0027t move, but in the attempt to do so, Gottstein found himself skittering out of the chair. Montez reached out an arm to steady him.\\n\\n Gottstein flushed. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll get used to the gravity.\"\\n\\n Gottstein said, \"But aren\u0027t you making it out a lot worse than it is? Earth isn\u0027t a know-nothing planet altogether. We did develop the Electron Pump. That\u0027s a purely Terrestrial accomplishment. No Lunarite had anything to do with it.\"\\n\\n Montez shook his head and muttered a few words in his native Spanish. They didn\u0027t sound like placid words. He said, \"Have you ever met Frederick Hallam?\"\\n\\n Gottstein smiled. \"Yes, as a matter of fact I have. The Father of the Electron Pump. I believe he has the phrase tattooed on his chest.\"\\n\\n \"The mere fact that you smile and make that remark proves my point, really. Ask yourself: Could a man like Hallam really have fathered the Electron Pump? For the unthinking multitude, the story will do, but the fact is - and you must know it if you stop to think about it - there is no father to the Electron Pump. The para-people, \u0026e people in the para-Universe, whoever they are and whatever that is, invented it. Hallam was their accidental instrument. All of Earth is their accidental instrument.\"\\n\\n \"We were clever enough to take advantage of their initiative.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, as cows are clever enough to eat the hay we provide for them. The Pump is no sign that man is forward-looking. Quite the reverse.\"\\n\\n \"If the Pump is a backward step, then I say good for backwardness. I wouldn\u0027t want to do without it.\"\\n\\n \"Who would? But the point is it fits Earth\u0027s present mood perfectly. Infinite energy at virtually zero cost, except for maintenance, and with zero pollution besides. But there are no Electron Pumps on the Moon.\"\\n\\n Gottstein said, \"I imagine there\u0027s no need for them. The Solar batteries supply what the Lunarites require. Infinite energy at virtually zero cost, except for maintenance, and with zero pollution besides. . . . Isn\u0027t that the litany?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, indeed, but the Solar batteries are entirely man-made. That\u0027s the point I\u0027m making. An Electron Pump was projected for the Moon; installation was attempted.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And it didn\u0027t work. The para-people didn\u0027t accept the tungsten. Nothing happened.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know that. Why not?\"\\n\\n Montez lifted his shoulders and eyebrows expressively. \"How is one to know? We might assume, for instance, that the para-people live on a world without a satellite; that they have no conception of separate worlds in close proximity, each populated; that, having found one, they did not seek another. Who knows? - The point is, that the para-people didn\u0027t bite and we ourselves, without them, could do nothing.\"\\n\\n \"We ourselves,\" repeated Gottstein, thoughtfully. \"By that, you mean the Earthmen?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And the Lunarites?\"\\n\\n \"They were not involved.\"\\n\\n \"Were they interested?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s where my uncertainty - and fear - chiefly rests. The Lunarites - the native Lunarites, particularly - do not feel like Earthmen. I don\u0027t know what their plans are or what they intend. I can\u0027t find out.\"\\n\\n Gottstein looked thoughtful. \"But what can they do? Do you have any reason to suppose they intend to do us harm; or that they can do Earth harm even if they intend it?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t answer that question. They are an attractive and intelligent people. It seems to me they lack real hatred or real rage or even real fear. But perhaps that is what only seems to me. What bothers me most is that I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"The scientific equipment on the Moon is run by Earth, I believe.\"\\n\\n \"That is correct. The proton synchrotron is. The radio telescope on the trans-terrestrial side is. The three-hundred-inch optical telescope is. . . . The large equipment, that is, all of which has been in existence for fifty years.\"\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s been done since?\"\\n\\n \"Very little by Earthmen.\"\\n\\n \"What about the Lunarites?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. Their scientists work in the large installations, but I once tried to check time cards. There are gaps.\"\\n\\n \"Gaps?\"\\n\\n \"They spend considerable time away from the large installations. It is as though they had laboratories of their own.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if they produce mini-electronic devices and fine biochemicals, isn\u0027t that to be expected?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but - Gottstein, I don\u0027t know. I fear my ignorance.\"\\n\\n There was a moderately long pause. Gottstein said, \"Montez, I take it you are telling me all this so that I will be careful; so that I will try to find out what the Lunarites are doing?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose that\u0027s about it,\" said Montez, unhappily.\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t even know that they\u0027re doing anything at all.\"\\n\\n \"I feel that they are.\"\\n\\n Gottstein said, \"It\u0027s odd, then. I should be trying to talk you out of all this fearful mysticism of yours - but it\u0027s odd - \"\\n\\n \"What is?\"\\n\\n \"The same vessel that brought me to the Moon brought someone else to the Moon. I mean, a large party came, but one face in particular triggered something. I didn\u0027t talk to him - had no occasion to - and I dismissed the matter. But now our talk is pushing a button, and he suddenly comes back to mind - \"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I was on a committee once that dealt with Electron Pump matters. A question of safety.\" He smiled briefly. \"Earth\u0027s lost nerve, you might say. We worry about safety everywhere - and a good thing, damn it, lost nerve or not. The details escape me but in connection with that hearing, I saw that face that now I saw on the vessel. I\u0027m convinced of it.\"\\n\\n \"Does that have significance, do you think?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I associate that face with something disturbing. If I keep on thinking, it may come back to me. In any case, I had better get a list of the passengers and see if any name means something to me. Too bad, Montez, but I think you\u0027re getting me started.\"\\n\\n \"Not bad at all,\" said Montez. \"I\u0027m glad of it. As for this man; it may be he is only a tourist of no consequence and will be gone in two weeks, but I am glad to have you thinking about the matter - \"\\n\\n Gottstein did not seem to be listening. \"He is a physicist, or a scientist of some sort,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027m certain of it and I associate him with danger - \"\\n\\n 4\\n\\n \"Hello,\" said Selene, cheerfully.\\n\\n The Earthman turned around. Recognition took almost no time at all. \"Selene! Am I right? Selene!\"\\n\\n \"Right! Correctly pronounced. Are you enjoying yourself?\"\\n\\n The Earthman said gravely, \"Very much. It makes me realize how unique our century is. It was not so long ago I was on Earth, feeling tired of my world, tired of myself. Then I thought: Well, if I were living a hundred years ago, the only way I could leave the world would be to die, but now - I can go to the Moon.\" He smiled without real gaiety.\\n\\n Selene said, \"Are you happier now that you are on the Moon?\"\\n\\n \"A little.\" He looked about. \"Don\u0027t you have a crowd of tourists to take care of?\"\\n\\n \"Not today,\" she said, cheerfully. \"It\u0027s my day off. Who knows, I may take two or three. It\u0027s a dull job.\"\\n\\n \"What a shame, then, that you bump into a tourist on your day off.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t bump into you. I came looking for you. And a hard job that was, too. You shouldn\u0027t wander off by yourself.\"\\n\\n The Earthman looked at her with interest. \"Why should you look for me? Are you fond of Earthmen?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, with easy frankness. \"I\u0027m sick of them. I dislike them on principle and being constantly associated with them in my job makes it worse.\"\\n\\n \"Yet you come looking for me and there isn\u0027t a way on Earth - on the Moon, I mean - that I can convince myself I am young and handsome.\"\\n\\n \"Even if you were, it wouldn\u0027t help. Earthmen don\u0027t interest me, as everyone but Barren knows.\"\\n\\n \"Then why do you come looking for me?\"\\n\\n \"Because there are other ways of being interested and because Barton is interested.\"\\n\\n \"And who is Barron? Your boyfriend?\"\\n\\n Selene laughed. \"Barron Neville. He\u0027s a lot more than a boy and a lot more than a friend. We have sex when we feel like it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s what I meant. Do you have children?\"\\n\\n \"One boy. He\u0027s ten. He spends most of his time in the boys\u0027 compound. To spare you the next question, he\u0027s not Barron\u0027s. I may have a child by Barron If we\u0027re still together when I\u0027m assigned another child - if I\u0027m assigned another child. . . . I am pretty sure I will be.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re quite frank.\"\\n\\n \"About things I don\u0027t consider secret? Of course . . . Now what would you like to do?\"\\n\\n They had been walking along a corridor of milk-white rock, into the glazed surface of which were Inset dusky bits of \"Moon-gems\" that lay about for the taking in most sections of the Lunar surface. She wore sandals which scarcely seemed to touch the ground; he wore thick-soled boots which leadenly helped weigh him down to keep his steps from becoming torture.\\n\\n The corridor was one-way. Occasionally, a small electric cart would overtake them and move nearly silently past.\\n\\n The Earthman said, \"Now what would I like to do? That is a broad-beamed invitation. Would you like to set boundary conditions so that my answers will not innocently offend you?\"\\n\\n \"Are you a physicist?\"\\n\\n The Earthman hesitated. \"Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n \"Just to hear what you would say. I know you\u0027re a physicist.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"No one says \u0027set boundary conditions\u0027 unless they are.\\n\\n Especially if the first thing they want to see on the Moon is the proton synchrotron.\"\\n\\n \"Is that why you\u0027ve come looking for me? Because I seem to be a physicist?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why Barron sent me looking for you. Because he\u0027s a physicist. I came because I thought you were rather unusual for an Earthman.\"\\n\\n \"In what way?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing terribly complimentary - if it\u0027s compliments you\u0027re fishing for. It\u0027s just that you seem not to like Earth-men.\"\\n\\n \"How can you tell that?\"\\n\\n \"I watched you look at the others in the party. Besides, I can always tell somehow. It\u0027s the Earthies who don\u0027t like Earthies who tend to stay on the Moon. Which brings me back to the question. . . . What would you like to do? And I\u0027ll set the boundary conditions. I mean as far as sightseeing is concerned.\"\\n\\n The Earthman looked at her sharply. \"That\u0027s peculiar, Selene. You have a day off. Your job is sufficiently uninteresting or distasteful so that you are glad to have the day off and would be willing to make it two or three. Yet your way of spending it is to volunteer to resume your job for me particularly. . . . Just because of a little interest.\"\\n\\n \"Barron\u0027s interest. He\u0027s busy now and there\u0027s no harm in entertaining you until he\u0027s ready . . . Besides, it\u0027s different. Can\u0027t you see it\u0027s different? On my job I\u0027m riding herd on a couple of dozen Earthies - Don\u0027t you mind my using the term?\"\\n\\n \"I use it myself.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-18.html","bookId":1744,"book":{"id":1744,"title":"The Gods Themselves","description":"Storyline: Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.
