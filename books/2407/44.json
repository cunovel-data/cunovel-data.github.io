Ishiguro\u0027s body, sagging and heavy with concrete, was lifted into the air, and swung past me, over my head.\n Bits of cement dripped down on me, and spattered on the sign at my feet. The sign was for the Nakamoto Construction Company, and it said in bold letters:\n Building for a New Tomorrow.\n And underneath:\n Please Excuse the Inconvenience.\n Chapter 5\n It took another hour to get everything settled at the site. And the chief wanted our reports by the end of the day, so afterward we had to go down to Parker to do the paperwork.\n It was four o\u0027clock before we went across the street to the coffee shop next to Antonio\u0027s bail bond shop. Just to get away from the office. I said, \"Why did Ishiguro kill the girl in the first place?\"\n Connor sighed. \"It\u0027s not clear. The best I can understand it is this. Eddie was working for his father\u0027s kaisha all along. One of the things he did was supply girls for visiting dignitaries. He\u0027d been doing that for years. It was easy - he was a party guy; he knew the girls; the congressmen wanted to meet the girls, and he got a chance to make friends with the congressmen. But in Cheryl he had a special opportunity, because Senator Morton, head of the Finance Committee, was attracted to her. Morton was smart enough to break off the affair, but Eddie kept sending her in private jets to meet him unexpectedly, keeping the thing alive. Eddie liked her, too: he had sex with her that afternoon. And it was Eddie who arranged for her to come to the party at Nakamoto, knowing that Morton would be there. Eddie was pushing Morton to block the sale, so Eddie was preoccupied with the Saturday meeting. By the way, on the news-station tape you thought he said \u0027no cheapie\u0027 to Cheryl. He was saying nichibei. The Japanese-American relationship.\n \"But I think Eddie just intended for Cheryl to meet Morton. I doubt he had any idea about the forty-sixth floor. He certainly didn\u0027t expect her to go up there with Morton. The idea of going there must have been suggested during the party by someone from Nakamoto. The company left the floor accessible for a very simple reason: there\u0027s a bedroom suite up there that executives sometimes use. Somewhere in the back.\"\n I said, \"How did you know that?\"\n Connor smiled. \"Hanada-san mentioned he had once used it. Apparently it\u0027s quite luxurious.\"\n \"So you do have contacts.\"\n \"I have a few. I imagine Nakamoto was probably just being accommodating, too. They may have installed cameras up there with the idea of blackmail, but I\u0027m told there were no cameras in the bedroom suite. And the fact that they had a camera right in the conference room suggests to me that Phillips was right - the cameras were placed to kaizen the office workers. Certainly they couldn\u0027t have expected the sexual encounter to occur where it did.\n \"Anyway, when Eddie saw Cheryl going off with Morton to another part of the Nakamoto building, it must have alarmed the hell out of him. So he followed them. He witnessed the murder, which I believe was probably accidental. And Eddie then helped out his friend Morton, calling him over, getting him out of there. Eddie went back to the party with Morton.\"\n \"What about the tapes?\"\n \"Ah. You remember we talked about bribery. One of Eddie\u0027s bribes was to a low-level security officer named Tanaka. I believe Eddie supplied him with drugs. Anyway, Eddie had known him for a couple of years. And when Ishiguro ordered Tanaka to pull the tapes, Tanaka told Eddie.\"\n \"And Eddie went down and got the tapes himself.\"\n \"Yes. Together with Tanaka.\"\n \"But Phillips said Eddie was alone.\"\n \"Phillips lied, because he knew Tanaka. That\u0027s also why he didn\u0027t make more of a fuss - Tanaka said it was all right. But when Phillips told us the story, he left Tanaka out.\"\n \"And then?\"\n \"Ishiguro sent a couple of guys to clean out Cheryl\u0027s apartment. Tanaka took the tapes someplace to get them copied. Eddie went to the party in the hills.\"\n \"But Eddie kept one.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n I thought it over. \"But when we talked to Eddie at the party, he told a completely different story.\"\n Connor nodded. \"He lied.\"\n \"Even to you, his friend?\"\n Connor shrugged. \"He thought he could get away with it.\"\n \"What about Ishiguro? Why did he kill the girl?\"\n \"To get Morton in his pocket. And it worked - they got Morton to change his position on MicroCon. For a while there, Morton was going to allow the sale to go forward.\"\n \"Ishiguro would kill her for that? For some corporate sale?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think it was calculated at all. Ishiguro was high-strung, under great pressure. He felt he had to prove himself to his superiors. He had much at stake - so much, that he behaved differently from an ordinary Japanese under these circumstances. And in a moment of extreme pressure, he killed the girl, yes. As he said, she was a woman of no importance.\"\n \"Jesus.\"\n \"But I think there\u0027s more to it than that. Morton was very ambivalent about the Japanese. I had the sense there was a lot of resentment - those jokes about dropping the bomb, all that. And having sex on the boardroom table. It\u0027s... disrespectful, wouldn\u0027t you say? It must have infuriated Ishiguro.\"\n \"And who called in the murder?\"\n \"Eddie.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"To embarrass Nakamoto. Eddie got Morton safely back to the party, and then called in. Probably from a phone somewhere at the party. When he called, he didn\u0027t know about the security cameras yet. Then Tanaka told him about them, and Eddie started to worry that Ishiguro might set him up. So he called back.\"\n \"And he asked for his friend John Connor.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n I said, \"So Eddie was Koichi Nishi?\"\n Connor nodded. \"His little joke. Koichi Nishi is the name of a character in a famous Japanese movie about corporate corruption.\"\n Connor finished his coffee and pushed away from the counter.\n \"And Ishiguro? Why did the Japanese abandon him?\"\n \"Ishiguro had played it too fast and loose. He acted too independently Thursday night. They don\u0027t like that. Nakamoto would have sent him back pretty soon. He was destined to spend the rest of his life in Japan in a madogiwazoku. A window seat. Somebody who\u0027s bypassed by corporate decisions, and stares out the window all day. In a way, it\u0027s a life sentence.\"\n I thought it over. \"So when you used the car phone, calling the station, telling them what you planned... who was listening?\"\n \"Hard to say.\" Connor shrugged. \"But I liked Eddie. I owed him one. I didn\u0027t want to see Ishiguro go home.\"\n Back in the office there was an elderly woman waiting for me. She was dressed in black and she introduced herself as Cheryl Austin\u0027s grandmother. Cheryl\u0027s parents died in a car crash when she was four, and she had raised the little girl afterward. She wanted to thank me for my help in the investigation. She talked about what Cheryl had been like, as a little girl. How she had grown up in Texas.\n \"Of course, she was pretty,\" she said, \"and the boys surely did like her. Always a bunch of them hanging around, you couldn\u0027t shake them off with a stick.\" She paused. \"Of course, I never thought she was entirely right in the head. But she wanted to keep those boys around. And she liked them to fight over her, too. I remember she was seven or eight, she\u0027d get those kids brawling in the dust, and she\u0027d clap her hands and watch them go at it. By the time she was teenage, she was real good at it. Knew just what to do. It wasn\u0027t real nice to see. No, something was wrong in the head. She could be mean. And that song, she always played it, day and night. About lose my mind, I\u0027d think.\"\n \"Jerry Lee Lewis?\"\n \"Of course, I knew why. That was her Daddy\u0027s favorite song. When she was just a little bit of a thing, he\u0027d drive her to town in his convertible, with his arm around her, and the radio making that awful racket. She\u0027d have her best sun-dress on. She was such a pretty thing when she was a child. The image of her mother.\"\n Then the woman started to cry, thinking about that. I got her a Kleenex. Tried to be sympathetic.\n And pretty soon she wanted to know what had happened. How Cheryl had died.\n I didn\u0027t know what to say to her.\n As I was coming out of the ground-floor entrance to Parker Center, walking out by the fountains, a Japanese man in a suit stopped me. He was about forty, with dark hair and a mustache. He greeted me formally, and gave me his card. It took a moment to realize that this was Mr. Shirai, the head of finance for Nakamoto.\n \"I wanted to see you in person, Sumisu-san, to express to you how much my company regrets the behavior of Mr. Ishiguro. His actions were not proper and be acted without authority. Nakamoto is an honorable company and we do not violate the law. I want to assure you that he does not represent our company, or what we stand for in doing business. In this country, the work of Mr. Ishiguro put him in contact with many investment bankers, and men who make leveraged buy-outs. Frankly, I believe he was too long in America. He adopted many bad habits here.\"\n So there it was, an apology and an insult in the same moment. I didn\u0027t know what to say to him, either.\n Finally, I said, \"Mr. Shirai, there was the offer of financing, for a small house...\"\n \"Oh, yes?\"\n \"Yes. Perhaps you didn\u0027t hear of it.\"\n \"Actually, I believe I have heard something of that.\"\n I said, \"I was wondering what you intended to do about that offer now.\"\n There was a long silence.\n Just the splash of the fountains off to my right.\n Shirai squinted at me in the hazy afternoon light, trying to decide how to play it.\n Finally he said, \"Sumisu-san, the offer is improper. It is of course withdrawn.\"\n \"Thank you, Mr. Shirai,\" I said.\n Connor and I drove back to my apartment. Neither of us talked. I was driving on the Santa Monica freeway. The signs overhead had been spray-painted by gangs. I was aware of how uneven and bumpy the roadway was. To the right, the skyscrapers around Westwood stood hazy in smog. The landscape looked poor and decrepit.\n Finally I said, \"So is that all this was? Just competition between Nakamoto and some other Japanese company? Over MicroCon? Or what?\"\n Connor shrugged. \"Multiple purposes, probably. The Japanese think in those ways. And to them, America is now only an arena for their competition. That much is true. We\u0027re just not very important, in their eyes.\"\n We came to my street. There was a time when I thought it was pleasant, a little tree-lined street of apartments, with a playground at the end of the block for my daughter. Now I wasn\u0027t feeling that way. The air was bad, and the street seemed dirty, unpleasant.\n I parked the car. Connor got out, shook my hand. \"Don\u0027t be discouraged.\"\n \"I am.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be. It\u0027s very serious. But it can all change. It\u0027s changed before. It can change again.\"\n \"I guess.\"\n \"What are you going to do now?\" he asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I feel like going somewhere else. But there\u0027s nowhere to go.\"\n He nodded. \"Leave the department?\"\n \"Probably. Certainly leave Special Services. It\u0027s too... unclear for me.\"\n He nodded. \"Take care, kōhai. Thanks for your help.\"\n \"You, too, sempai.\"\n I was tired. I climbed the stairs to my apartment and went inside. It was quiet, with my daughter gone. I got a can of Coke from the refrigerator and walked into the living room, but my back hurt when I sat in the chair. I got up again, and turned on the television. I couldn\u0027t watch it. I thought of how Connor said everybody in America focused on the unimportant things. It was like the situation with Japan: if you sell the country to Japan, then they will own it, whether you like it or not. And people who own things do what they want with them. That\u0027s how it works.\n I walked into my bedroom and changed my clothes. On the bedside table, I saw the pictures from my daughter\u0027s birthday that I had been sorting when all this started. The pictures that didn\u0027t look like her, that didn\u0027t fit the reality anymore. I listened to the tinny laughter from the television in the other room. I used to think things were basically all right. But they\u0027re not all right.\n I walked into my daughter\u0027s room. I looked at her crib, and her covers with the elephants sewn on it. I thought of the way she slept, so trustingly, lying on her back, her arms thrown over her head. I thought of the way she trusted me to make her world for her now. And I thought of the world that she would grow into. And as I started to make her bed, I felt uneasy in my heart.\n Transcript of:\n March 15 (99)\n INT: All right, Pete, I think that about does it for us. Unless you have anything else.\n SUBJ: No. I\u0027m done.\n INT: I understand you resigned from the Special Services.\n SUBJ: That\u0027s right.\n INT: And you made a written recommendation to Chief Olson that the Asian liaison program be changed. You said the connection with the Japan-America Amity Foundation should be severed?\n SUBJ: Yes.\n INT: Why is that?\n SUBJ: If the department wants specially trained officers, we should pay to train them. I just think it\u0027s healthier.\n INT: Healthier?\n SUBJ: Yes. It\u0027s time for us to take control of our country again.

They fight against real feelings caused by real circumstances. They build mental worlds of shoulds, oughts, and might-have-beens. Real changes begin with real appraisal and acceptance of what is. Then realistic action is possible.\"\n These are the words of David Reynolds, an American exponent of Japanese Morita psychotherapy. He is speaking of personal behavior, but his comments are applicable to the economic behavior of nations, as well.\n Sooner or later, the United States must come to grips with the fact that Japan has become the leading industrial nation in the world. The Japanese have the longest lifespan. They have the highest employment, the highest literacy, the smallest gap between rich and poor. Their manufactured products have the highest quality. They have the best food. The fact is that a country the size of Montana, with half our population, will soon have an economy equal to ours. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-44.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: \n During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
