We may need to leave quickly.\"\\n\\n The Bora Bora was this week\u0027s hot L.A. restaurant. The decor was a jumble of Polynesian masks and shields. Lime green wooden outriggers jutted out over the bar like teeth. Above the open kitchen, a Prince video played ghostlike on an enormous five-meter screen. The menu was Pacific Rim; the noise deafening; the clientele movie-industry hopeful. Everyone was dressed in black.\\n\\n Connor smiled. \"It looks like Trader Vic\u0027s after a bomb went off, doesn\u0027t it? Stop staring. Don\u0027t they let you out enough?\"\\n\\n \"No, they don\u0027t,\" I said. Connor turned to speak to the Eurasian hostess. I looked at the bar, where two women kissed briefly on the lips. Farther down, a Japanese man in a leather bomber jacket had his arm around a huge blonde. They were both listening to a man with thinning hair and a pugnacious manner whom I recognized as the director of -\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Connor said to me. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Eddie\u0027s not here.\"\\n\\n \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"At a party in the hills. Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n Chapter 15\\n\\n The address was on a winding road in the hills above Sunset Boulevard. We would have had a good view of the city up here, but the mist had closed in. As we approached, the street was lined on both sides with luxury cars: mostly Lexus sedans, with a few Mercedes convertibles and Bentleys. The parking attendants looked surprised as we pulled up in our Chevy sedan, and headed up to the house.\\n\\n Like other residences on the street, the house was surrounded by a three-meter wall, the driveway closed off with a remote-controlled steel gate. There was a security camera mounted above the gate, and another at the path leading up to the house itself. A private security guard stood by the path and checked our badges.\\n\\n I said, \"Whose house is this?\"\\n\\n Ten years ago, the only people in Los Angeles who maintained such elaborate security were either Mafioso, or stars like Stallone whose violent roles attracted violent attention. But lately it seemed everybody in wealthy residential areas had security. It was expected, almost fashionable. We walked up steps through a cactus garden toward the house, which was modern, concrete, and fortresslike. Loud music played.\\n\\n \"This house belongs to the man who owns Maxim Noir.\" He must have seen my blank look. \"It\u0027s an expensive clothing store famous for its snotty salespeople. Jack Nicholson and Cher shop there.\"\\n\\n \"Jack Nicholson and Cher,\" I said, shaking my head. \"How do you know about it?\"\\n\\n \"Many Japanese shop at Maxim Noir now. It\u0027s like most expensive American stores - it\u0027d go out of business without visitors from Tokyo. It\u0027s dependent on the Japanese.\"\\n\\n As we approached the front door a large man in a sport coat appeared. He had a clipboard with names. \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s by invitation only, gentlemen.\"\\n\\n Connor flashed his badge. \"We\u0027d like to speak to one of your guests,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Which guest is that, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Sakamura.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t look happy. \"Wait here, please.\"\\n\\n From the entryway, we could see into the living room. It was crowded with party-goers, who at a quick glance seemed to be many of the same people who had been at the Nakamoto reception. As in the restaurant, almost everyone was wearing black. But the room itself caught my attention: it was stark white, entirely unadorned. No pictures on the wall. No furniture. Just bare white walls and a bare carpet. The guests looked uncomfortable. They were holding cocktail napkins and drinks, looking around for someplace to put them.\\n\\n A couple passed us on their way to the dining room. \"Rod always knows what to do,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"So elegantly minimalist. The detail in executing that room. I don\u0027t know how he ever got that paint job. It\u0027s absolutely perfect. Not a brush stroke, not a blemish. A perfect surface.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it has to be,\" she said. \"It\u0027s integral to his whole conception.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really quite daring,\" the man said.\\n\\n \"Daring?\" I said. \"What are they talking about? It\u0027s just an empty room.\"\\n\\n Connor smiled. \"I call it faux zen. Style without substance.\"\\n\\n I scanned the crowd.\\n\\n \"Senator Morton\u0027s here.\" He was standing in the corner, holding forth. Looking very much like a presidential candidate.\\n\\n \"So he is.\"\\n\\n The guard hadn\u0027t returned, so we stepped a few feet into the room. As I approached Senator Morton, I heard him say, \"Yes, I can tell you exactly why I\u0027m disturbed about the extent of Japanese ownership of American industry. If we lose the ability to make our own products, we lose control over our destiny. It\u0027s that simple. For example, back in 1987 we learned that Toshiba sold the Russians critical technology that allowed the Soviets to silence their submarine propellers. Russian nuclear subs now sit right off the coast and we can\u0027t track them, because they got technology from Japan. Congress was furious, and the American people were up in arms. And rightly so, it was outrageous. Congress planned economic retaliation against Toshiba. But the lobbyists for American companies pleaded their case for them, because American companies like Hewlett-Packard and Compaq were dependent on Toshiba for computer parts. They couldn\u0027t stand a boycott because they had no other source of supply. The fact was, we couldn\u0027t afford to retaliate. They could sell vital technology to our enemy, and there wasn\u0027t a damned thing we could do about it. That\u0027s the problem. We\u0027re now dependent on Japan - and I believe America shouldn\u0027t be dependent on any nation.\"\\n\\n Somebody asked a question, and Morton nodded. \"Yes, it\u0027s true that our industry is not doing well. Real wages in this country are now at 1962 levels. The purchasing power of American workers is back where it was thirty-odd years ago. And that matters, even to the well-to-do folks that I see in this room, because it means American consumers don\u0027t have the money to see movies, or buy cars, or clothing, or whatever you people have to sell. The truth is, our nation is sliding badly.\"\\n\\n A woman asked another question I couldn\u0027t hear, and Morton said, \"Yes, I said 1962 levels. I know it\u0027s hard to believe, but think back to the fifties, when American workers could own a house, raise a family, and send the kids to college, all on a single paycheck. Now both parents work and most people still can\u0027t afford a house. The dollar buys less, everything is more expensive. People struggle just to hold on to what they have. They can\u0027t get ahead.\"\\n\\n I found myself nodding as I listened. About a month before, I had gone looking for a house, hoping to get a backyard for Michelle. But housing prices were just impossible in L.A. I was never going to be able to afford one, unless I remarried. Maybe not even then, considering -\\n\\n I felt a sharp jab in the ribs. I turned around and saw the doorman. He jerked his head toward the front door. \"Back, fella.\"\\n\\n I was angry. I glanced at Connor, but he just quietly moved back to the entrance.\\n\\n In the entryway, the doorman said, \"I checked. There\u0027s no Mr. Sakamura here.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Sakamura,\" Connor said, \"is the Japanese gentleman standing at the back of the room, to your right. Talking to the redhead.\"\\n\\n The doorman shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry, fellas. Unless you have a search warrant, I\u0027ll have to ask you to leave.\"\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t a problem here,\" Connor said. \"Mr. Sakamura is a friend of mine. I know he\u0027d like to talk to me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. Do you have a search warrant?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re trespassing. And I\u0027m asking you to leave.\"\\n\\n Connor just stood there.\\n\\n The doorman stepped back and planted his feet wide. He said, \"I think you should know I\u0027m a black belt.\"\\n\\n \"Are you really?\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"So is Jeff,\" the doorman said, as a second man appeared.\\n\\n \"Jeff;\" Connor said. \"Are you the one who\u0027ll be driving your friend here to the hospital?\"\\n\\n Jeff laughed meanly. \"Hey. You know, I like humor. It\u0027s funny. Okay, Mr. Wise Guy. You\u0027re in the wrong place. You\u0027ve had it explained. Move out. Now.\" He poked Connor in the chest with a stubby finger.\\n\\n Connor said quietly, \"That\u0027s assault.\"\\n\\n Jeff said, \"Hey. Fuck you, buddy. I told you you\u0027re in the wrong place - \"\\n\\n Connor did something very fast, and Jeff was suddenly down on the floor, moaning in pain. Jeff rolled away, coming to rest against a pair of black trousers. Looking up, I saw that the man wearing the trousers was dressed entirely in black: black shirt, black tie, black satin jacket. He had white hair and a dramatic Hollywood manner. \"I\u0027m Rod Dwyer. This is my home. What seems to be the problem?\"\\n\\n Connor introduced us politely and showed his badge. \"We\u0027re here on official business. We asked to speak to one of your guests, Mr. Sakamura, who is the man standing over there in the corner.\"\\n\\n \"And this man?\" Dwyer asked, pointing to Jeff, who was gasping and coughing on the floor.\\n\\n Connor said calmly, \"He assaulted me.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t fucking assault him!\" Jeff said, sitting up on his elbow, coughing.\\n\\n Dwyer said, \"Did you touch him?\"\\n\\n Jeff was silent, glowering.\\n\\n Dwyer turned back to us. \"I\u0027m sorry this happened. These men are new. I don\u0027t know what they were thinking of. Can I get you a drink?\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, we\u0027re on duty,\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"Let me ask Mr. Sakamura to come over and talk to you. Your name again?\"\\n\\n \"Connor.\"\\n\\n Dwyer walked away. The first man helped Jeff to his feet. As Jeff limped away, he muttered, \"Fucking assholes.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Remember when police were respected?\"\\n\\n But Connor was shaking his head, looking down at the floor. \"I am very ashamed,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t explain further.\\n\\n \"Hey, John! John Connor! Hisashiburi dana! Long time no see! How they hanging, guy? Hey!\" He punched Connor in the shoulder.\\n\\n Up close, Eddie Sakamura wasn\u0027t so handsome. His complexion was gray, with pock-marked skin, and he smelled like day-old scotch. His movements were edgy, hyperactive, and he spoke quickly. Fast Eddie was not a man at peace.\\n\\n Connor said, \"I\u0027m pretty good, Eddie. How about you? How you doing?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, can\u0027t complain, Captain. One or two things only. Got a five-oh-one, drunk driving, try to beat that, but you know, with my record, it\u0027s getting hard. Hey! Life goes on! What\u0027re you doing here? Pretty wild place, huh? Latest thing: no furniture! Rod sets new style. Great! Nobody can sit down any more!\" He laughed. \"New style! Great!\"\\n\\n I had the feeling he was on drugs. He was too manic. I got a good look at the scar on his left hand. It was purple-red, roughly four centimeters by three. It appeared to be an old burn.\\n\\n Connor lowered his voice and said, \"Actually, Eddie, we\u0027re here about the yakkaigoto at Nakamoto tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes,\" Eddie said, lowering his voice, too. \"No surprise she came to a bad end. That\u0027s one henntai.\"\\n\\n \"She was perverted? Why do you say that?\"\\n\\n Eddie said, \"Want to step outside? Like to smoke cigarette and Rod doesn\u0027t allow smoking in the house.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Eddie.\"\\n\\n We went outside and stood by the edge of the cactus garden. Eddie lit a Mild Seven Menthol. \"Hey, Captain, I don\u0027t know what you heard already so far. But that girl. She fucked some of the people in there. She fucked Rod. Some of the other people. So. We can talk easier out here, okay with you?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"I know that girl real well. Real well. You know I\u0027m hipparidako, hey? I can\u0027t help it. Popular guy! She\u0027s all over me. All the time.\"\\n\\n \"I know that, Eddie. But you say she had problems?\"\\n\\n \"Big problems, amigo. Grande problemos. I tell you. She was a sick girl, this girl. She got off on pain.\"\\n\\n \"World\u0027s full of \u0027em, Eddie.\"\\n\\n He sucked on his cigarette. \"Hey, no,\" he said. \"I\u0027m talking something else. I\u0027m talking, how she gets off. When you hurt her real bad she comes. She\u0027s always asking, more, more. Do it more. Squeeze harder.\"\\n\\n Connor said, \"Her neck?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Her neck. Right. Squeeze her neck. Yeah. You heard? And sometimes a plastic bag. You know, dry-cleaning bag? Put it over her head and clamp it, hold it around her neck while you fuck her and she sucks the plastic against her mouth and turns blue in the face. Claws at your back. Gasp and wheeze. Christ Almighty. Don\u0027t care for that, myself. But I\u0027m telling you, this girl has a pussy. I mean she gets off, it\u0027s wild ride. You remember afterwards. I\u0027m telling you. But for me, too much. Always on the edge, you know? Always a risk. Always pushing the edge. Maybe this time. Maybe this is the last time. You know what I\u0027m saying?\" He flicked his cigarette away. It sputtered among the cactus thorns. \"Sometimes it\u0027s exciting. Like Russian roulette. Then I couldn\u0027t take it, Captain. Seriously. I couldn\u0027t. And you know me, I like a wild time.\"\\n\\n I decided that Eddie Sakamura gave me the creeps. I tried to make notes while he talked, but his words were tumbling out, and I couldn\u0027t keep up. He lit another cigarette, his hands shaking. He kept talking fast, swinging the glowing tip in the air for emphasis.\\n\\n \"And I mean, this girl, it\u0027s a problem,\" Eddie said. \"Okay, pretty girl. She\u0027s pretty. But sometimes she can\u0027t go out, looks too bad. Sometimes, she needs lot of makeup, because neck is sensitive skin, man. And hers is bruised. Ring around the collar. Bad. You saw that, maybe. You see her dead, Captain?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I saw her.\"\\n\\n \"So then...\" he hesitated. He seemed to step back, reconsider something. He flicked ash from the cigarette. \"So. Was she strangled, or what?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Eddie. She was strangled.\"\\n\\n He inhaled. \"Yeah. Figures.\"\\n\\n \"Did you see her, Eddie?\"\\n\\n \"Me? No. What are you talking about? How could I see her, Captain?\" He exhaled, blowing smoke into the night.\\n\\n \"Eddie. Look at me.\"\\n\\n Eddie turned toward Connor.\\n\\n \"Look in my eyes. Now tell me. Did you see the body?\"\\n\\n \"No. Captain, come on.\" Eddie gave a nervous little laugh, and looked away. He flicked the cigarette so it tumbled in the air, dripping sparks. \"What is this? Third degree? No. I didn\u0027t see the body.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-13.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
