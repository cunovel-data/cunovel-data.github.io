Let me get this makeup off; and we can go.\"\n \"All right,\" Connor said.\n Morton walked away, toward the makeup room.\n Ishiguro turned to Connor and said, \"Totemo taihenna koto ni narimashita ne.\"\n Connor said, \"I agree. It is difficult.\"\n Ishiguro hissed through his teeth. \"Heads will roll.\"\n \"Yours first,\" Connor said. \"Sō omowa nakai.\"\n The senator was walking toward the stairway going up to the second floor. Woodson came over to him, leaned close, and whispered something. The senator threw his arm around his shoulder. They walked arm in arm a moment. Then the senator went upstairs.\n Ishiguro said bleakly, \"Konna hazuja nakatta no ni.\"\n Connor shrugged. \"I am afraid I have little sympathy. You attempted to break the laws of this country and now there is going to be big trouble. Eraikoto ni naruyo, Ishiguro-san.\"\n \"We will see, Captain.\"\n Ishiguro turned and gave Eddie a frosty look. Eddie shrugged and said, \"Hey, I got no problems! Know what I mean, compadre? You got all problems now.\" And he laughed.\n The floor manager, a heavyset guy wearing a headset, came over. \"Is one of you Lieutenant Smith?\"\n I said I was.\n \"A Miss Asakuma is calling you. You can take it over there.\" He pointed to a living-room set. Couch and easy chairs, against a morning city skyline. I saw a blinking telephone by one chair.\n I walked over and sat in the chair and picked up the phone. \"Lieutenant Smith.\"\n \"Hi, it\u0027s Theresa,\" she said. I liked the way she used her first name. \"Listen, I\u0027ve been looking at the last part of the tape. The very end. And I think there may be a problem.\"\n \"Oh? What kind of a problem?\" I didn\u0027t tell her Morton had already confessed. I looked across the stage. The senator had already gone upstairs; he was out of sight. Woodson, his aide, was pacing back and forth at the foot of the stairs, a pale, stricken look on his face. Nervously, he fingered his belt, feeling it through his suit coat.\n Then I heard Connor say, \"Ah, shit!\" and he broke into a run, sprinting across the studio toward the stairs. I stood up, surprised, dropped the phone, and followed him. As Connor passed Woodson, he said \"You son of a bitch,\" and then he was taking the stairs two at a time, racing upward. I was right behind him. I heard Woodson say something like, \"I had to.\"\n When we got to the second floor hallway Connor shouted \"Senator!\" That was when we heard the single, cracking report. It wasn\u0027t loud: it sounded like a chair falling over.\n But I knew that it was a gunshot.\n Second Night\n Chapter 1\n The sun was setting on the sekitei. The shadows of the rocks rippled over the concentric circles of raked sand. I sat and stared at the patterns. Connor was somewhere inside, still watching television. I could faintly hear the newscast. Of course, a Zen temple would have a television set on the premises. I was starting to become accustomed to these contradictions.\n But I didn\u0027t want to watch TV any more. I had seen enough, in the last hour, to know how the media was going to play it. Senator Morton had been under a great deal of stress lately. His family life was troubled; his teenage son had recently been arrested for drunk driving, after an accident in which another teenager had been seriously injured. The senator\u0027s daughter was rumored to have had an abortion. Mrs. Morton was not available for comment, although reporters were standing outside the family townhouse in Arlington.\n The senator\u0027s staff all agreed that the senator had been under enormous pressure lately, trying to balance family life and his own impending candidacy. The senator had not been himself; he had been moody and withdrawn, and in the words of one staffer, \"He seemed to have been troubled by something personal.\"\n While no one questioned the senator\u0027s judgment, one colleague, Senator Dowling, said that Morton had \"become a bit of a fanatic about Japan lately, perhaps an indication of the strain he was under. John didn\u0027t seem to think accommodation with Japan was possible anymore, and of course we all know that we have to make an accommodation. Our two nations are now too closely bound together. Unfortunately, none of us could have known the strain he was really under. John Morton was a private man.\"\n I sat watching the rocks in the garden turn gold, then red. An American Zen monk named Bill Harris came out and asked me if I wanted tea, or perhaps a Coke. I said no. He went away. Looking back inside, I saw flickering blue light from the tube. I couldn\u0027t see Connor.\n I looked back at the rocks in the garden.\n The first gunshot had not killed Senator Morton. When we kicked open the bathroom door, he was bleeding from the neck, staggering to his feet. Connor shouted \"Don\u0027t!\" just as Morton put the gun in his mouth and fired again. The second shot was fatal. The gun kicked out of his hands and went spinning across the tile floor of the bathroom. It came to rest near my shoes. There was a lot of blood on the walls.\n Then people started screaming. I had turned back and I saw the makeup girl in the doorway, holding her hands to her face and screaming at the top of her lungs. Eventually, when the paramedics came, they sedated her.\n Connor and I had stayed until the division sent Bob Kaplan and Tony Marsh. They were the detectives in charge, and we were free to go. I told Bob we\u0027d give statements whenever he wanted them, and we left. I noticed that Ishiguro had already gone. So had Eddie Sakamura.\n That had bothered Connor. \"That damn Eddie,\" he said. \"Where is he?\"\n \"Who cares?\" I said.\n \"There\u0027s a problem with Eddie,\" Connor said.\n \"What problem?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you notice how he acted around Ishiguro? He was too confident,\" Connor said. \"Much too confident. He should have been frightened and he wasn\u0027t.\"\n I shrugged. \"You said it yourself, Eddie\u0027s crazy. Who knows why he does what he does.\" I was tired of the case, and tired of Connor\u0027s endless Japanese nuances. I said I thought Eddie had probably gone back to Japan. Or to Mexico, where he had said earlier that he wanted to go.\n \"I hope you\u0027re right,\" Connor said.\n He led me toward the rear entrance to the station. Connor said he wanted to leave before the press arrived. We got into our car and left. He directed me to the Zen center. We had been there ever since. I had called Lauren but she was out of the office. I called Theresa at the lab but her line was busy. I called home, and Elaine said that Michelle was fine, and the reporters had all gone. She asked if I wanted her to stay and give Michelle dinner. I said yes, that I might be home late.\n And then for the next hour, I watched television. Until I didn\u0027t want to watch any more.\n It was almost dark. The sand was purple-gray. My body was stiff from sitting, and it was growing chilly. My beeper went off, I was getting a call from the division. Or perhaps it was Theresa. I got up and went inside.\n On the television set, Senator Stephen Rowe was expressing sympathy for the bereaved family, and talking about the fact that Senator Morton had been overstressed. Senator Rowe pointed out that the Akai offer had not been withdrawn. The sale was, so far as Rowe knew, still going through, and there would not now be any serious opposition.\n \"Hmmm,\" Connor said.\n \"The sale is back on?\" I said.\n \"It seems it was never off.\" Connor was obviously worried.\n \"You don\u0027t approve of the sale?\"\n \"I\u0027m worried about Eddie. He was so cocky. It\u0027s a question of what Ishiguro will do now.\"\n \"Who cares?\" I was tired. The girl was dead, Morton was dead, and the sale was going forward.\n Connor shook his head. \"Remember the stakes,\" he said. \"The stakes are huge. Ishiguro isn\u0027t concerned about a sordid little murder, or even the strategic purchase of some high-tech company. Ishiguro is concerned about Nakamoto\u0027s reputation in America. Nakamoto has a large corporate presence in America, and it wants it to be larger. Eddie can damage that reputation.\"\n \"How?\"\n He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know, for sure.\"\n My beeper went off again. I called in. It was Frank Ellis, the watch officer at division headquarters for the evening.\n \"Hey, Pete,\" he said. \"We got a call for Special Services. Sergeant Matlovsky, down at vehicle impound. He\u0027s asking for language assistance.\"\n \"What is it?\" I said.\n \"He says he\u0027s got five Japanese nationals down there, demanding to inspect the wrecked vehicle.\"\n I frowned. \"What wrecked vehicle?\"\n \"That Ferrari. The one in the high-speed pursuit. Apparently it\u0027s pretty ragged: the impact crushed it, and there was a fire. And the body was cut out with torches by the VHDV teams this morning. But the Japanese insist on inspecting the vehicle anyway. Matlovsky can\u0027t tell from the paperwork whether it\u0027s okay to let somebody look at it or not. You know, whether it\u0027s material to an ongoing investigation or not. And he can\u0027t speak the language to understand the Japanese. One of the Japanese claims to be related to the deceased. So, you want to go down there and handle it?\"\n I sighed. \"Am I on tonight? I was on last night.\"\n \"Well, you\u0027re on the board. You traded nights with Allen, looks like.\"\n I dimly remembered. I had traded nights with Jim Allen so he could take his kid to a Kings hockey game. I had agreed to it a week ago, but it seemed like something from my distant past.\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll handle it.\"\n I went back to tell Connor I had to leave. He listened to the story and suddenly jumped to his feet, \"Of course! Of course! What was I thinking of? Damn!\" He pounded his hand in his fist. \"Let\u0027s go, kōhai.\"\n \"We\u0027re going to impound?\"\n \"Impound? Absolutely not.\"\n \"Then what are we doing?\"\n \"Oh, damn it, I\u0027m a fool!\" he said. He was already heading for the car.\n I hurried after him.\n As I pulled up in front of Eddie Sakamura\u0027s house, Connor leapt from the car, and raced up the steps. I parked and ran after him. The sky was deep blue. It was almost night.\n Connor was taking the steps two at a time. \"I blame myself,\" he said. \"I should have seen it earlier. I should have understood what it meant.\"\n \"What what meant?\" I said. I was panting a little, at the top of the steps.\n Connor threw open the front door. We went inside. The living room was exactly as I had last seen it, earlier in the day, when I had stood there talking to Graham.\n Connor went quickly from room to room. In the bedroom, a suitcase lay open. Armani and Byblos jackets lay on the bed, waiting to be packed. \"The little idiot,\" Connor said. \"He should never have come back here.\"\n The pool lights were on outside. They cast a green rippling pattern on the ceiling. Connor went outside.\n The body lay face down in the water, naked, floating in the center of the pool, a dark silhouette in the glowing green rectangle. Connor got a skimmer pole and pushed Eddie toward the far edge. We hauled him up onto the concrete lip.\n The body was blue and cold, beginning to stiffen. He appeared unmarked.\n \"They would be careful about that,\" Connor said.\n \"About what?\"\n \"About not letting anything show. But I\u0027m sure we can find the proofs...\" He got out his penlight and peered inside Eddie\u0027s mouth. He inspected the nipples, and the genitals. \"Yes. There. See the rows of red dots? On the scrotum. And there on the side of the thigh...\"\n \"Alligator clips?\"\n \"Yes. For the electric shock coil. Damn!\" Connor said. \"Why didn\u0027t he tell me? All that time, when we were driving from your apartment to the television station to see the senator. He could have said something then. He could have told me the truth.\"\n \"About what?\"\n Connor didn\u0027t answer me. He was lost in his own thoughts. He sighed. \"You know, in the end, we are just gaijin. Foreigners. Even in his desperation, we\u0027re excluded. And anyway, he probably wouldn\u0027t tell us because...\"\n He fell silent. He stared at the corpse. Finally, he slid the body back into the water. It floated out again.\n \"Let somebody else do the paperwork,\" Connor said, standing up. \"We don\u0027t need to be the ones who found the body. It doesn\u0027t matter.\" He watched Eddie drift back to the center of the pool. The head tilted down slightly. The heels bobbed on the surface.\n \"I liked him,\" Connor said. \"He did favors for me. I even met his family when I was in Japan. Some of his family. Not the father.\" He watched the body rotate slowly. \"But Eddie was okay. And now, I want to know.\"\n I was lost. I had no idea what he was talking about, but I didn\u0027t think I should say anything. Connor looked angry.\n \"Come on,\" he said finally. \"We have to move fast. There\u0027s only a couple of possibilities. And once again, we have fallen behind events. But if it\u0027s the last thing I do, I want to get that son of a bitch.\"\n \"What son of a bitch?\"\n \"Ishiguro.\"\n Chapter 2\n We were driving back to my apartment. \"You take the night off,\" he said.\n \"I\u0027m going with you,\" I said.\n \"No. I\u0027ll do this alone, kōhai. It\u0027s better if you don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Know what?\" I said.\n We went on like this for a while. He didn\u0027t want to tell me. Finally he said, \"Tanaka went to Eddie\u0027s house last night because Eddie had the tape. Presumably, the original.\"\n \"Right...\"\n \"And Tanaka wanted it back. That\u0027s why they had an argument. When you and Graham came, and all hell broke loose, Eddie told Tanaka the tape was in the Ferrari. So Tanaka went down there, panicked when he saw the police, and drove the car away.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"I always assumed the tape was destroyed in the crash, and the fire.\"\n \"Yes...\"\n \"But obviously it wasn\u0027t. Because Eddie wouldn\u0027t dare be so cocky around Ishiguro unless he still had a tape. The tape would be his ace in the hole. He knew it. But he obviously didn\u0027t understand how ruthless Ishiguro would be.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-40.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: \n During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
