Those things shouldn\u0027t have been left behind.\"\n \"You said yourself, they\u0027re in a hurry.\"\n \"Maybe. But you know the Japanese think American police are incompetent. This sloppiness is a sign of their disdain.\"\n \"Well, we\u0027re not incompetent.\"\n Connor shook his head. \"Compared to the Japanese, we are incompetent. In Japan, every criminal gets caught. For major crimes, convictions run ninety-nine percent. So any criminal in Japan knows from the outset he is going to get caught. But here, the conviction rate is more like seventeen percent. Not even one in five. So a criminal in the States knows he probably isn\u0027t going to get caught - and if he\u0027s caught, he won\u0027t be convicted, thanks to all his legal safeguards. And you know every study of police effectiveness shows that American detectives either solve the case in the first six hours, or they never solve it at all.\"\n \"So what are you saying?\"\n \"I\u0027m saying that a crime occurred here with the expectation that it won\u0027t be solved. And I want to solve it, kōhai.\"\n Connor was silent for the next ten minutes. He sat very still, with his arms folded and his chin sunk on his chest. His breathing was deep and regular. I might have thought he had fallen asleep, except his eyes were open.\n I just drove the car, and listened to him breathe.\n Finally, he said: \"Ishiguro.\"\n \"What about him?\"\n \"If we knew what made Ishiguro behave as he did, we\u0027d understand this case.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"It\u0027s hard for an American to see him clearly,\" Connor said. \"Because in America, you think a certain amount of error is normal. You expect the plane to be late. You expect the mail to be undelivered. You expect the washing machine to break down. You expect things to go wrong all the time.\n \"But Japan is different. Everything works in Japan. In a Tokyo train station, you can stand at a marked spot on the platform and when the train stops, the doors will open right in front of you. Trains are on time. Bags are not lost. Connections are not missed. Deadlines are met. Things happen as planned. The Japanese are educated, prepared, and motivated. They get things done. There\u0027s no screwing around.\"\n \"Uh-huh...\"\n \"And tonight was a very big night for the Nakamoto Corporation. You can be sure they planned everything down to the smallest detail. They have the vegetarian hors d\u0027oeuvres that Madonna likes and the photographer she prefers. Believe me: they\u0027re prepared. They have planned for every exigency. You know how they are: they sit around and discuss endless possibilities - what if there\u0027s a fire? What if there\u0027s an earthquake? A bomb scare? Power failure? Endlessly going over the most unlikely events. It\u0027s obsessive, but when the final night arrives, they\u0027ve thought of everything and they\u0027re in complete control. It\u0027s very bad form not to be in control. Okay?\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"But there is our friend Ishiguro, the official representative of Nakamoto, standing in front of a dead girl, and he\u0027s clearly not in control. He\u0027s yōshiki nō, doing Western-style confrontation, but he isn\u0027t comfortable - I\u0027m sure you noticed the sweat on his lip. And his hand is damp; he keeps wiping it on his trousers. He is rikutsuppoi, too argumentative. He\u0027s talking too much.\n \"In short, he\u0027s behaving as if he doesn\u0027t really know what to do, as if he doesn\u0027t even know who this girl is - which he certainly does, since he knows everybody invited to that party - and pretending he doesn\u0027t know who killed her. When he almost certainly knows that, too.\"\n The car bounced in a pothole, and jolted back up. \"Wait a minute. Ishiguro knows who killed the girl?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure of it. And he\u0027s not the only one. At least three people must know who killed her, at this point. Didn\u0027t you say you used to be in press relations?\"\n \"Yes. Last year.\"\n \"You keep any contacts in TV news?\"\n \"A few,\" I said. \"They might be rusty. Why?\"\n \"I want to look at some tape that was shot tonight.\"\n \"Just look? Not subpoena?\"\n \"Right. Just look.\"\n \"That shouldn\u0027t be a problem,\" I said. I was thinking I could call Jennifer Lewis at KNBC, or Bob Arthur at KCBS. Probably Bob.\n Connor said, \"It has to be somebody you can approach personally. Otherwise the stations won\u0027t help us. You noticed there were no TV crews at the crime scene tonight. At most crime scenes, you have to fight your way past the cameras just to get to the tape. But tonight, no TV crews, no reporters. Nothing.\"\n I shrugged. \"We were on land lines. The press couldn\u0027t monitor radio transmissions.\"\n \"They were already there,\" Connor said, \"covering the party with Tom Cruise and Madonna. And then a girl gets murdered on the floor above. So where were the TV crews?\"\n I said, \"Captain, I don\u0027t buy it.\"\n One of the things I learned as a press officer is that there aren\u0027t any conspiracies. The press is too diverse, and in a sense too disorganized. In fact, on the rare occasions when we needed an embargo - like a kidnapping with ransom negotiations in progress - we had a hell of a time getting cooperation. \"The paper closes early. The TV crews have to make the eleven o\u0027clock news. They probably went back to edit their stories.\"\n \"I disagree. I think the Japanese expressed concern about their kigyō image, their company image, and the press cooperated with no coverage. Trust me, kōhai: the pressure is being applied.\"\n \"I can\u0027t believe that.\"\n \"Take my word for it,\" Connor said. \"The pressure is on.\"\n Just then, the car phone rang.\n \"God damn it, Peter,\" a familiar rough voice said. \"What the fuck\u0027s going on with that homicide investigation?\" It was the chief. It sounded like he had been drinking.\n \"How do you mean, Chief?\"\n Connor looked at me, and punched the speaker phone button so he could hear.\n The chief said: \"You guys harassing the Japanese? We going to have another set of racial allegations against the department here?\"\n \"No sir,\" I said. \"Absolutely not. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve heard - \"\n \"I heard that dumb fuck Graham was making insults as usual,\" the chief said.\n \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t exactly say insults, Chief - \"\n \"Look, Peter. Don\u0027t shit me. I already reamed out Fred Hoffmann for sending Graham in the first place. I want that racist turd off the case. We\u0027ve all got to get along with the Japanese from now on. It\u0027s the way the world is. You hearing me, Peter?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Now about John Connor. You got him with you, is that right?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Why did you bring him into this?\"\n I thought: why did I bring him in? Fred Hoffmann must have decided to say that Connor was my idea, and not his own.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"But I - \"\n \"I understand,\" the chief said. \"You probably thought you couldn\u0027t handle the case yourself. Wanted some help. But I\u0027m afraid you bought more trouble than help. Because the Japanese don\u0027t like Connor. And I got to tell you. I go way back with John. We entered the academy together back in fifty-nine. He\u0027s always been a loner and a troublemaker. You know, anybody who goes to live in some foreign country, it\u0027s because he can\u0027t fit in here at home. I don\u0027t want him screwing up this investigation now.\"\n \"Chief - \"\n \"This is how I see it, Peter. You got a homicide here, wrap it up and get it over with. Do it quick and do it neat. I\u0027m looking to you and you alone. You hearing me?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"The connection is good?\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n \"Wrap it up, Pete,\" the chief said. \"I don\u0027t want anybody else calling me on this.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Finish it by tomorrow latest. That\u0027s it.\" And he hung up.\n I put the phone back in the cradle.\n \"Yes,\" Connor said. \"I\u0027d say pressure is being applied.\"\n Chapter 11\n I drove south on the 405 freeway, toward the airport. It was foggier here. Connor stared out the window.\n \"In a Japanese organization, you\u0027d never get a call like that. The chief just hung you out to dry. He takes no responsibility - it\u0027s all your problem. And he\u0027s blaming you for things that have nothing to do with you, like Graham, and me.\" Connor shook his head. \"The Japanese don\u0027t do that. The Japanese have a saying: fix the problem, not the blame. In American organizations it\u0027s all about who fucked up. Whose head will roll. In Japanese organizations it\u0027s about what\u0027s fucked up, and how to fix it. Nobody gets blamed. Their way is better.\"\n Connor was silent, staring out the window. We were driving past Slauson, the Marina freeway a dark curve arcing above us in the fog.\n I said, \"The chief was in the bag, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"Yes. And uninformed, as usual. But even so, it sounds like we\u0027d better have this case solved before he gets out of bed tomorrow.\"\n \"Can we do that?\"\n \"Yes. If Ishiguro delivers those tapes.\"\n The phone rang again. I answered it.\n It was Ishiguro.\n I handed the phone to Connor.\n I could hear Ishiguro faintly through the receiver. He sounded tense, speaking rapidly. \"A, moshi moshi, Connor-san desuka? Keibi no heyani denwa shitan desuga ne. Daremo denain desuyo.\"\n Connor cupped his hand over the phone and translated. \"He called the security guard but no one was there.\"\n \"Sorede, chuōkeibishitsu ni renraku shite, hito wo okutte moraimashite, issho ni tepu o kakunin shite kimashita.\"\n \"Then he called the main security office and asked them to come down with him to check the tapes.\"\n \"Tepu wa subete rekōdā no naka ni arimasu. Nakunattemo torikaeraretemo imasen. Subete daijōbu desu.\"\n \"The tapes are all in the recorders. No tapes are missing or switched.\" Connor frowned and replied. \"Iya, tepu wa surikaerarete iru hazu nanda. Tepu o sagase!\"\n \"Dakara, daijōbu nandesu, Connor-san. Dōshiro to iun desuka?\"\n \"He insists everything is in order.\"\n Connor said, \"Tepu o sagase!\" To me, he said, \"I told him I wanted the damn tapes.\"\n \"Daijōbuda to itterudeshou. Dōshite sonnaini tepu ni kodawarun desuka?\"\n \"Ore niwa wakatte irunda. Tepu wa nakunatte iru. I know more than you think, Mr. Ishiguro. Mōichido iu, tepu o sagasunda!\"\n Connor banged the phone in the cradle, and sat back, snorting angrily. \"Bastards. They\u0027re taking the position that there are no missing tapes.\"\n \"What does that mean?\" I said.\n \"They\u0027ve decided to play hardball.\" Connor stared out the window at the traffic, and tapped his teeth with his finger. \"They\u0027d never do it unless they felt they had a strong position. An unassailable position. Which means...\"\n Connor drifted off into his private thoughts. I saw his face intermittently reflected in the glass under passing street lamps. Finally he said, \"No, no, no,\" as if he were talking to someone.\n \"No, what?\"\n \"It can\u0027t be Graham.\" He shook his head. \"Graham is too risky - too many ghosts from the past. And it\u0027s not me, either. I\u0027m old news. So it must be you, Peter.\"\n I said, \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"Something has happened,\" Connor said, \"to make Ishiguro think he has leverage. And I\u0027d guess it\u0027s something to do with you.\"\n \"Me?\"\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s almost certainly something personal. You have any problems in your past?\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"Any priors, arrests, internal affairs investigations, allegations of questionable conduct like drinking or homosexuality or chasing women? Any drug rehab program, problems with partners, problems with superiors. Anything personal or professional. Anything.\"\n I shrugged. \"Jeez, I don\u0027t think so.\"\n Connor just waited, looking at me. Finally he said, \"They think they have something, Peter.\"\n \"I\u0027m divorced. I\u0027m a single parent. I have a daughter, Michelle. She\u0027s two years old.\"\n \"Yes...\"\n \"I lead a quiet life. I take care of my kid. I\u0027m responsible.\"\n \"And your wife?\"\n \"My ex-wife is a lawyer in the D.A.\u0027s office.\"\n \"When did you get divorced?\"\n \"Two years ago.\"\n \"Before the child was born?\"\n \"Just after.\"\n \"Why did you get divorced?\"\n \"Christ. Why does anybody get divorced.\"\n Connor said nothing.\n \"We were only married a year. She was young when we met. Twenty-four. She had these fantasies about things. We met in court. She thought I was a rough, tough detective facing danger every day. She liked that I had a gun. All that. So we had this affair. Then when she got pregnant she didn\u0027t want to have an abortion. She wanted to get married instead. It was some romantic idea she had. She didn\u0027t really think it through. But the pregnancy was hard, and it was too late to abort, and pretty soon she decided she didn\u0027t like living with me because my apartment was small, and I didn\u0027t make enough money, and I lived in Culver City instead of Brentwood. And by the time the baby was finally born, it was like she was completely disillusioned. She said she had made a mistake. She wanted to pursue her career. She didn\u0027t want to be married to a cop. She didn\u0027t want to raise a kid. She said she was sorry, but it was all a mistake. And she left.\"\n Connor was listening with his eyes closed. \"Yes...\"\n \"I don\u0027t see why all this matters. She left two years ago. And after that, I couldn\u0027t - I didn\u0027t want to work detective hours any more, because now I had to raise the kid, so I took the tests and transferred to Special Services, and I worked the press office. No problems there. Everything went fine. Then last year this Asian liaison job came up, and it paid better. Another couple hundred a month. So I applied for that.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"I mean, I can really use the money. I have extra expenses now, like Michelle\u0027s day care. You know what day care costs for two-year-olds? And I have full-time housekeeping, and Lauren doesn\u0027t make her child-support payments more than half the time. She says she can\u0027t manage on her salary, but she just bought a new BMW, so I don\u0027t know. I mean, what am I going to do, take her to court? She works for the fucking D.A.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-9.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: \n During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
