{"id":74737,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\"And the guard seemed to think it was.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s what he said. I was letting him off the hook. Actually, he knew perfectly well it was not broken.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"No. It was one of the few mistakes that the Japanese have made. But they only made it because they were stuck - they couldn\u0027t get around it. They couldn\u0027t beat their own technology.\"\\n\\n I leaned back against the wall. I looked apologetically at Theresa. She looked beautiful in the semidarkness of the monitors. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m lost.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you are rejecting the obvious explanation, kōhai. Think back. If you saw a line of tape recorders, each one running a few seconds later than the one before, and you saw one recorder way out of sequence, what would you think?\"\\n\\n \"That someone had changed the tape in that one recorder at a later time.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. And that\u0027s exactly what happened.\"\\n\\n \"One tape was switched later?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n I frowned. \"But why? All of the tapes were replaced at nine o\u0027clock. So none of the replacements showed the murder, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Correct,\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"Then why switch one tape after that?\"\\n\\n \"Good question. It\u0027s puzzling. I couldn\u0027t make sense of it for a long time. But now I know,\" Connor said. \"You have to remember the timing. The tapes were all changed at nine. Then one tape was changed again at ten-fifteen. The obvious assumption was that something important happened between nine o\u0027clock and ten-fifteen, that it was recorded on the tape, and the tape was therefore taken away for some reason. I asked myself: what could this important event be?\"\\n\\n I thought back. I frowned. I couldn\u0027t think of anything.\\n\\n Theresa began to smile and nod, as if something had just amused her. I said, \"You know?\"\\n\\n \"I can guess,\" she said, smiling.\\n\\n \"Well,\" I said. \"I\u0027m glad everyone seems to know the answer except me. Because I can\u0027t think of anything important being recorded on that tape. By nine o\u0027clock, the yellow barrier was up, isolating the crime scene. The girl\u0027s body was on the other side of the room. There were a lot of Japanese standing by the elevators, and Graham was calling me on the phone for help. But nobody actually began an investigation until I got there at about ten. Then we had a lot of back and forth with Ishiguro. I don\u0027t think anybody crossed the tape until almost ten-thirty. Say ten-fifteen at the earliest. So if somebody looked at a recording, all it would show is a deserted room, and a girl lying on the table. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n Connor said, \"Very good. Except you have forgotten something.\"\\n\\n Theresa said, \"Did anybody cross the room? Anybody at all?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"We had the yellow barrier up. Nobody was allowed on the other side of the tape. In fact - \"\\n\\n And then I remembered. \"Wait a minute! There was somebody! That little guy with the camera,\" I said. \"He was on the other side of the barrier, taking pictures.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"What little guy?\" she said.\\n\\n \"A Japanese guy. He was taking pictures. We asked Ishiguro about him. He said his name was, ah...\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Tanaka,\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, Mr. Tanaka. And you asked Ishiguro for the film from his camera.\" I frowned. \"But we never got it.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Connor said. \"And frankly, I never thought we would.\"\\n\\n Theresa said, \"This man was taking pictures?\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that he was actually taking pictures,\" Connor said. \"Perhaps he was, because he was using one of those little Canons - \"\\n\\n \"The ones that shoot video stills, instead of film?\"\\n\\n \"Right. Would there be any use for those, in retouching?\"\\n\\n \"There might be,\" she said. \"The images might be used for texture mapping. They\u0027d go in fast, because they were already digitized.\"\\n\\n Connor nodded. \"Then perhaps he was taking pictures, after all. But it was clear to me that his picture-taking was just an excuse to allow him to walk on the other side of the yellow line.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" Theresa said, nodding.\\n\\n I said, \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"Think back,\" Connor said.\\n\\n I had been standing facing Ishiguro when Graham yelled: Aw, Christ, what is this? And I looked back over my shoulder and saw a short Japanese man about ten meters beyond the yellow tape. The man\u0027s back was turned to me. He was taking pictures of the crime scene. The camera was very small. It fitted into the palm of his hand.\\n\\n \"Do you remember how he moved?\" Connor said. \"He moved in a distinctive way.\"\\n\\n I tried to recall it. I couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n Graham had gone forward to the tape, saying: For Christ\u0027s sake, you can\u0027t be in there. This is a goddamned crime scene. You can\u0027t take pictures! And there was a general uproar. Graham was yelling at Tanaka, but he continued to be entirely focused on his work, shooting the camera and backing toward us. Despite all the yelling, Tanaka didn\u0027t do what a normal person would do - turn around and walk toward the tape. Instead, he backed up to the yellow stripe and, still turned away, ducked his head and went under it.\\n\\n I said, \"He never turned around. He backed up all the way.\"\\n\\n \"Correct. That is the first mystery. Why would he back up? Now, I think, we know.\"\\n\\n \"We do?\"\\n\\n Theresa said, \"He was repeating the walk of the girl and the killer in reverse, so it would be laid down on videotape and he would have a good record of where the shadows in the room were.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Connor said.\\n\\n I remembered that when I protested, Ishiguro had said to me: This is our employee. He works for Nakamoto Security.\\n\\n And I had said: This is outrageous. He can\u0027t take pictures.\\n\\n And Ishiguro had explained: But this is for our corporate use.\\n\\n And meanwhile the man had disappeared in the crowd, slipping through the knot of men at the elevator.\\n\\n But this is for our corporate use.\\n\\n \"Damn it!\" I said. \"So Tanaka left us, went downstairs, and removed a single tape, because that tape had a record of his own walk across the room, and the shadows he cast?\"\\n\\n \"Correct.\"\\n\\n \"And he needed that tape to make changes in the original tapes?\"\\n\\n \"Correct.\"\\n\\n I was finally beginning to understand. \"But now, even if we can figure out how the tapes were altered, they won\u0027t stand up in a court of law, is that right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Theresa said. \"Any good lawyer will make sure they\u0027re inadmissible.\"\\n\\n \"So the only way to go forward is to get a witness who can testify to what was done. Sakamura might know, but he\u0027s dead. So we\u0027re stuck unless we can somehow get our hands on Mr. Tanaka. I think we better get him in custody right away.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that will ever happen,\" Connor said.\\n\\n \"Why not? You think they\u0027ll keep him from us?\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t think they have to. It is very likely that Mr. Tanaka is already dead.\"\\n\\n Connor immediately turned to Theresa. \"Are you good at your job?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Very good?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"We have little time left. Work with Peter. See what you can extract from the tape. Gambatte: try very hard. Trust me that your efforts will be rewarded. In the meantime, I have some calls to make.\"\\n\\n I said, \"You\u0027re leaving?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I\u0027ll need the car.\"\\n\\n I gave him the keys. \"Where are you going?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not your wife.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just asking,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it. I need to see some people.\" He turned to go.\\n\\n \"But why do you say Tanaka is dead?\"\\n\\n \"Well, perhaps he\u0027s not. We\u0027ll discuss it when there is more time. Right now, we have a lot to finish before four o\u0027clock. That is our true deadline. I think you have surprises in store for you, kōhai. Just call it my chokkan, my intuition. Okay? You have trouble, or something unexpected, call me on the car phone. Good luck. Now work with this lovely lady. Urayamashii ne! \"\\n\\n And he left. We heard the rear door close.\\n\\n I said to Theresa, \"What did he say?\"\\n\\n \"He said he envies you.\" She smiled in the darkness. \"Let\u0027s begin.\"\\n\\n She pressed buttons on the equipment in rapid succession. The tape rolled back to the beginning of the sequence.\\n\\n I said, \"How are we going to do this?\"\\n\\n \"There are three basic approaches to learn how video has been doctored. The first is blur and color edges. The second is shadow lines. We can try to work with those elements, but I\u0027ve been doing that for the last two hours, and I haven\u0027t gotten very far.\"\\n\\n \"And the third method?\"\\n\\n \"Reflected elements. I haven\u0027t looked at them yet.\"\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \"Basically, reflected elements - REs - are portions of the scene that are reflected within the image itself. Like when Sakamura walks out of the room, and his face is reflected in the mirror. There are almost certainly other reflections in that room. A desk lamp may be chrome, and it may show the people, distorted, as they pass. The walls of the conference room are glass. We may be able to pull a reflection off the glass. A silver paperweight on a desk, with a reflection in it. A glass vase of flowers. A plastic container. Anything shiny enough to make a reflection.\"\\n\\n I watched her reset the tapes, and prepare to run forward. Her one good hand moved quickly from one machine to the next as she talked. It was odd to stand next to a woman so beautiful, who was so unselfconscious of her beauty.\\n\\n \"In most images, there is something reflective,\" Theresa said. \"Outside, there are car bumpers, wet streets, glass windowpanes. And inside a room there are picture frames, mirrors, silver candlesticks, chrome table-legs... . There\u0027s always something.\"\\n\\n \"But won\u0027t they fix the reflections, too?\"\\n\\n \"If they have time, yes. Because now there are computer programs to map an image onto any shape. You can map a picture onto a complicated, twisted surface. But it takes time. So. Let\u0027s hope they had no time.\"\\n\\n She started the tapes forward. The first portion was dark, as Cheryl Austin first appeared by the elevators. I looked at Theresa. I said, \"How do you feel about this?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Helping us. The police.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, because I am Japanese?\" She glanced at me, and smiled. It was an odd, crooked smile. \"I have no illusions about Japanese. Do you know where Sako is?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"It is a city - a town, really - in the north. In Hokkaido. A provincial place. There is an American airfield there. I was born in Sako. My father was a kokujin mechanic. You know that word, kokujin? Niguro. A black man. My mother worked in a noodle shop where the air force personnel went. They married, but my father died in an accident when I was two years old. There was a small pension for the widow. So we had some money. But my grandfather took most of it, because he insisted he had been disgraced by my birth. I was ainoko and niguro. They are not nice words, what he called me. But my mother wanted to stay there, to stay in Japan. So I grew up in Sako. In this... place...\"\\n\\n I heard the bitterness in her voice.\\n\\n \"You know what the burakumin are?\" she said. \"No? I am not surprised. In Japan, the land where everyone is supposedly equal, no one speaks of burakumin. But before a marriage, a young man\u0027s family will check the family history of the bride, to be sure there are no burakumin in the past. The bride\u0027s family will do the same. And if there is any doubt, the marriage will not occur. The burakumin are the untouchables of Japan. The outcasts, the lowest of the low. They are the descendants of tanners and leather workers, which in Buddhism is unclean.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"And I was lower than burakumin, because I was deformed. To the Japanese, deformity is shameful. Not sad, or a burden. Shameful. It means you have done something wrong. Deformity shames you, and your family, and your community. The people around you wish you were dead. And if you are half black, the ainoko of an American big nose...\" She shook her head. \"Children are cruel. And this was a provincial place, a country town.\"\\n\\n She watched the tape go forward.\\n\\n \"So I am glad to be here. You Americans do not know in what grace your land exists. What freedom you enjoy in your hearts. You cannot imagine the harshness of life in Japan, if you are excluded from the group. But I know it very well. And I do not mind if the Japanese suffer a little now, from my efforts with my one good hand.\"\\n\\n She glared at me. The intensity turned her face to a mask. \"Does that answer your question, Lieutenant?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"It does.\"\\n\\n \"When I come to America, I think the Americans are very foolish about the Japanese - but never mind. Here is the sequence now. You watch the top two monitors. I will watch the bottom three. Look carefully for objects that reflect. Look closely. Here it comes.\"\\n\\n Chapter 19\\n\\n I watched the monitors in the darkness.\\n\\n Theresa Asakuma was feeling bitter about the Japanese, but so was I. The incident with Weasel Wilhelm had made me angry. Angry the way somebody who\u0027s scared can be angry. One sentence he had said kept coming back to my mind, again and again.\\n\\n Under the circumstances, don\u0027t you think the court made a mistake in granting you custody of your young daughter?\\n\\n I never wanted custody. In all the turmoil of the divorce, of Lauren moving out, packing up, this is yours, this is mine - in all that, the last thing I wanted was custody of a seven-month-old baby. Shelly was just starting to move around the living room, holding onto the furniture. She would say \"Mama.\" Her first word. But Lauren didn\u0027t want the responsibility and kept saying, \"I can\u0027t handle it, Peter. I just can\u0027t handle it.\" So I took custody. What else could I do?\\n\\n But now it was almost two years later. I had changed my life. I had changed my job, my schedule. She was my daughter now. And the thought of giving her up was like twisting a knife in my stomach.\\n\\n Under the circumstances, Lieutenant, don\u0027t you think...\\n\\n On the monitor, I watched as Cheryl Austin waited in the darkness for the arrival of her lover. I watched the way she looked around the room. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-34.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
