Keep your voice calm and even.\" \"Okay.\" \"If you can.\" \"Okay.\" \"It may be difficult to do. The Japanese can be irritating. You\u0027ll probably find them irritating tonight. Handle it as best you can. But whatever happens, don\u0027t lose your temper.\" \"All right.\" \"That\u0027s extremely bad form.\" \"All right,\" I said. Connor smiled. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do well,\" he said. \"You probably won\u0027t need my help at all. But if you get stuck, you\u0027ll hear me say \u0027Perhaps I can be of assistance.\u0027 That will be the signal that I\u0027m taking over. From that point on, let me do the talking, I\u0027d prefer you not speak again, even if you are spoken to directly by them. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"You may want to speak, but don\u0027t be drawn out.\" \"I understand.\" \"Furthermore, whatever I do, show no surprise. Whatever I do.\" \"Okay.\" \"Once I take over, move so that you\u0027re standing slightly behind me and to my right. Never sit. Never look around. Never appear distracted. Remember that although you come from an MTV video culture, they do not. They are Japanese. Everything you do will have meaning to them. Every aspect of your appearance and behavior will reflect on you, on the police department, and on me as your superior and sempai.\" \"Okay, Captain.\" \"Any questions?\" \"What\u0027s a sempai?\" Connor smiled. We drove past the searchlights, down the ramp into the underground garage. \"In Japan,\" he said, \"a sempai is a senior man who guides a junior man, known as a kōhai. The sempai-kōhai relationship is quite common. It\u0027s often assumed to exist whenever a younger man and an older man are working together. They will probably assume it of us.\" I said, \"Sort of a mentor and apprentice?\" \"Not exactly,\" Connor said. \"In Japan, sempai-kōhai has a different quality. More like a fond parent: the sempai is expected to indulge his kōhai, and put up with all sorts of youthful excesses and errors from the junior man.\" He smiled. \"But I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t do that to me.\" We came to the bottom of the ramp, and saw the flat expanse of the parking garage ahead of us. Connor stared out the window and frowned. \"Where is everybody?\" The garage of the Nakamoto Tower was full of limousines, the drivers leaning against their cars, talking and smoking. But I saw no police cars. Ordinarily, when there\u0027s a homicide, the place is lit up like Christmas, with lights flashing from a half-dozen black and whites, the medical examiner, paramedics, and all the rest. But there was nothing tonight. It just looked like a garage where somebody was having a party: elegant people standing in clusters, waiting for their cars. \"Interesting,\" I said. We came to a stop. The parking attendants opened the doors, and I stepped out onto plush carpet, and heard soft music. I walked with Connor toward the elevator. Well-dressed people were coming the other way: men in tuxedos, women in expensive gowns. And standing by the elevator, wearing a stained corduroy sport coat and furiously smoking a cigarette, was Tom Graham. Chapter 1 When Graham played halfback at U.S.C. he never made first string. That bit of history stuck like a character trait: all his life he seemed to miss the crucial promotion, the next step up a detective\u0027s career. He had transferred from one division to another, never finding a precinct that suited him, or a partner that worked well with him. Always too outspoken, Graham had made enemies in the chief\u0027s office, and at thirty-nine, further advancement was unlikely. Now he was bitter, gruff, and putting on weight - a big man who had become ponderous, and a pain in the ass: he just rubbed people the wrong way. His idea of personal integrity was to be a failure, and he was sarcastic about anybody who didn\u0027t share his views. \"Nice suit,\" he said to me, as I walked up. \"You look fucking beautiful, Peter.\" He flicked imaginary dust off my lapel. I ignored it. \"How\u0027s it going, Tom?\" \"You guys should be attending this party, not working it.\" He turned to Connor and shook his hand. \"Hello, John. Whose idea was it to get you out of bed?\" \"I\u0027m just observing,\" Connor said mildly. I said, \"Fred Hoffmann asked me to bring him down.\" \"Hell,\" Graham said. \"It\u0027s okay with me that you\u0027re here. I can use some help. It\u0027s pretty tense up there.\" We followed him toward the elevator. I still saw no other police officers. I said, \"Where is everybody?\" \"Good question,\" Graham said. \"They\u0027ve managed to keep all of our people around back at the freight entrance. They claim the service elevator gives fastest access. And they keep talking about the importance of their grand opening, and how nothing must disrupt it.\" By the elevators, a uniformed Japanese private security guard looked us over carefully. \"These two are with me,\" Graham said. The security man nodded, but squinted at us suspiciously. We got on the elevator. \"Fucking Japanese,\" Graham said, as the doors closed. \"This is still our country. We\u0027re still the fucking police in our own country.\" The elevator was glass walled and we looked out on downtown Los Angeles as it went up into the light mist. Directly across was the Arco building. All lit up at night. \"You know these elevators are illegal,\" Graham said. \"According to code, no glass elevators past ninety floors, and this building is ninety-seven floors, the highest building in L.A. But then this whole building is one big special case. And they got it up in six months. You know how? They brought in prefab units from Nagasaki, and slapped them together here. Didn\u0027t use American construction workers. Got a special permit to bypass our unions because of a so-called technical problem that only Japanese workers could handle. You believe that shit?\" I shrugged. \"They got it past the American unions.\" \"Hell, they got it past the city council,\" Graham said. \"But of course that\u0027s just money. And if there\u0027s one third we know, the Japanese have money. So they got variances on the zoning restrictions, the earthquake ordinances. They got everything they wanted.\" I shrugged. \"Politics.\" \"My ass. You know they don\u0027t even pay tax? That\u0027s right: they got an eight-year break on property taxes from the city. Shit: we\u0027re giving this country away.\" We rode for a moment in silence. Graham stared out the windows. The elevators were high-speed Hitachis, using the latest technology. The fastest and smoothest elevators in the world. We moved higher into the mist. I said to Graham, \"You want to tell us about this homicide, or do you want it to be a surprise?\" \"Fuck,\" Graham said. He flipped open his notebook. \"Here you go. The original call was at eight thirty-two. Somebody saying there is a \u0027problem of disposition of a body.\u0027 Male with a thick Asian accent, doesn\u0027t speak good English. The operator couldn\u0027t get much out of him, except an address. The Nakamoto Tower. Black and white goes over, arrives at eight thirty-nine p.m., finds it\u0027s a homicide. Forty-sixth floor, which is an office floor in this building. Victim is Caucasian female, approximately twenty-five years old. Hell of a good-looking girl. You\u0027ll see. \"The blue suits stretch the tape and call the division. I go over with Merino, arriving at eight fifty-three. Crime scene IU and SID show up about the same time for PE, prints, and pics. Okay so far?\" \"Yes,\" Connor said, nodding. Graham said, \"We\u0027re just getting started when some Jap from the Nakamoto Corporation comes up in a thousand-dollar blue suit and announces that he is entitled to a fucking conversation with the L.A.P.D. liaison officer before anything is done in their fucking building. And he\u0027s saying things like we got no probable cause. \"I go, what the fuck is this. We got an obvious homicide here. I think this guy should get back. But this Jap speaks excellent fucking English and he seems to know a lot of law. And everybody at the scene becomes, you know, concerned. I mean, there\u0027s no point in pushing to start an investigation if it\u0027s going to invalidate due process, right? And this Jap fucker is insisting the liaison must be present before we do anything. Since he speaks such fucking good English I don\u0027t know what the problem is. I thought the whole idea of a liaison was for people who don\u0027t speak the language and this fucking guy has Stanford law school written all over him. But anyway.\" He sighed. \"You called me,\" I said. \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Who is the man from Nakamoto?\" \"Shit.\" Graham scowled at his notes. \"Ishihara. Ishiguri. Something like that.\" \"You have his card? He must have given you his card.\" \"Yeah, he did. I gave it to Merino.\" I said, \"Any other Japanese there?\" \"What are you, kidding?\" Graham laughed. \"The place is swarming with them. Fucking Disneyland up there.\" \"I mean the crime scene.\" \"So do I,\" Graham said. \"We can\u0027t keep \u0027em out. They say it\u0027s their building, they have a right to be there. Tonight is the grand opening of the Nakamoto Tower. They have a right to be there. On and on.\" I said, \"Where is the opening taking place?\" \"One floor below the murder, on the forty-fifth floor. They\u0027re having one hell of a bash. Must be eight hundred people there. Movie stars, senators, congressmen, you name it. I hear Madonna is there, and Tom Cruise. Senator Hammond. Senator Kennedy. Elton John. Senator Morton. Mayor Thomas\u0027s there. District Attorney Wyland\u0027s there. Hey, maybe your ex-wife is there, too, Pete. She still works for Wyland, doesn\u0027t she?\" \"Last I heard.\" Graham sighed. \"Must be great to fuck a lawyer, instead of getting fucked by them. Must make for a nice change.\" I didn\u0027t want to talk about my ex-wife. \"We don\u0027t have a lot of contact any more,\" I said. A little bell rang, then the elevator said, \"Yonjūsan kai.\" Graham glanced at the glowing numbers above the door. \"Can you believe that shit?\" \"Yonjūyon kai,\" the elevator said. \"Mōsugu de gozaimasu.\" \"What\u0027d it say?\" \" \u0027We\u0027re almost at the floor.\u0027 \" \"Fuck,\" Graham said. \"If an elevator\u0027s going to talk, it should be English. This is still America.\" \"Just barely,\" Connor said, staring out at the view. \"Youjūgo kai,\" the elevator said. The door opened. Graham was right: it was a hell of a party. The whole floor had been made into a replica forties ballroom. Men in suits. Women in cocktail dresses. The band playing Glenn Miller swing music. Standing near the elevator door was a gray-haired, suntanned man who looked vaguely familiar. He had the broad shoulders of an athlete. He stepped onto the elevator and turned to me. \"Ground floor, please.\" I smelled whiskey. A second, younger man in a suit instantly appeared by his side. \"This elevator is going up, Senator.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" the gray-haired man said, turning to his aide. \"This elevator\u0027s going up, sir.\" \"Well. I want to go down.\" He was speaking with the careful, over-articulated speech of the drunk. \"Yes, sir. I know that, sir,\" the aide replied cheerfully. \"Let\u0027s take the next elevator, Senator.\" He gripped the gray-haired man firmly by the elbow and led him off the elevator. The doors closed. The elevator continued up. \"Your tax dollars at work,\" Graham said. \"Recognize him? Senator Stephen Rowe. Nice to find him partying here, considering he\u0027s on the Senate Finance Committee, which sets all Japanese import regulations. But like his pal Senator Kennedy, Rowe is one of the great pussy patrollers.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"They say he can drink pretty good, too.\" \"I noticed that.\" \"That\u0027s why he\u0027s got that kid with him. To keep him out of trouble.\" The elevator stopped at the forty-sixth floor. There was a soft electronic ping. \"Yonjūroku kai. Goriyō arigatō gozaimashita.\" \"Finally,\" Graham said. \"Now maybe we can get to work.\" Chapter 2 The doors opened. We faced a solid wall of blue business suits, backs turned to us. There must have been twenty men jammed in the area just beyond the elevator. The air was thick with cigarette smoke. \"Coming through, coming through,\" Graham said, pushing his way roughly past the men. I followed, Connor behind me, silent and inconspicuous. The forty-sixth floor had been designed to house the chief executive offices of Nakamoto Industries, and it was impressive. Standing in the carpeted reception area just beyond the elevators, I could see the entire floor - it was a gigantic open space. It was about sixty by forty meters, half the size of a football field. Everything added to the sense of spaciousness and elegance. The ceilings were high, paneled in wood. The furnishings were all wood and fabric, black and gray, and the carpet was thick. Sound was muted and lights were low, adding to the soft, rich quality. It looked more like a bank than a business office. The richest bank you ever saw. And it made you stop and look. I stood by the yellow crime-scene tape, which blocked access to the floor itself, and got my bearings. Directly ahead was the large atrium, a kind of open bullpen for secretaries and lower-level people. There were desks in clusters, and trees to break up the space. In the center of the atrium stood a large model of the Nakamoto Tower, and the complex of surrounding buildings still under construction. A spotlight shone on the model, but the rest of the atrium was relatively dark, with night lights. Private offices for the executives were arranged around the perimeter of the atrium. The offices had glass walls facing the atrium, and glass walls on the outside walls as well, so that from where I was standing you could look straight out to the surrounding skyscrapers of Los Angeles. It made you think the floor was floating in midair.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-2.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
