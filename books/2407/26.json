{"id":74729,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"What does it have to do with?\" \"My friends seemed to think it was personal. A chijou no motsure, a crime of passion. Involving a beautiful, irokichigai woman and a jealous man.\" \"And you believe them?\" \"Well, the thing is, they were unanimous. All three of these businessmen. Of course Japanese are reluctant to express disagreement among themselves, even on the golf course of an underdeveloped peasant country. But I have learned that unanimity toward a gaijin may cover a multitude of sins.\" \"You think they were lying?\" \"Not exactly.\" Connor shook his head. \"But I had the impression they were telling me something by not telling me. This morning was a game of hara no saguriai. My friends were not forthcoming.\" Connor described his golf game. There had been long silences all morning. Everyone in the foursome was polite and considerate, but spoken comments were rare and reserved. Most of the time, the men walked over the course in complete silence. \"And you had gone there for information?\" I said. \"How could you stand it?\" \"Oh, I was getting information.\" But as he explained it, it was all unspoken. Basically, the Japanese have an understanding based on centuries of shared culture, and they are able to communicate feelings without words. It\u0027s the closeness that exists in America between a parent and child - a child often understands everything, just from a parent\u0027s glance. But Americans don\u0027t rely on unspoken communication as a general rule, and the Japanese do. It is as if all Japanese are members of the same family, and they can communicate without words. To a Japanese, silences have meaning. \"It\u0027s nothing mystical or wonderful,\" Connor said. \"For the most part it is because the Japanese are so hemmed in by rules and conventions, they end up unable to say anything at all. For politeness, to save face, the other person is obliged to read the situation, the context, and the subtle signs of body posture and unstated feeling. Because the first person feels he can\u0027t actually put anything into words. Any speaking at all would be indelicate. So the point must be gotten across in other ways.\" I said, \"And that\u0027s how your morning was spent? Not talking?\" Connor shook his head. He felt he had quite clear communication with the Japanese golfers, and wasn\u0027t troubled by the silences at all. \"Because I was asking them to talk about other Japanese - members of their family - I had to frame my questions with great delicacy. Just as I would if I were asking whether your sister was in jail or any subject that was painful or awkward for you. I would be attentive to how long it took you to answer, and the pauses between your statements, the tone of your voice - all sorts of things. Beyond the literal communication. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"It means you get the feeling by an intuition.\" \"And what was the intuition you got?\" \"They said, \u0027We are mindful that you have performed services for us in the past. We feel a desire to help you now. But this murder is a Japanese matter and thus we are unable to tell you everything that we might like to. From our reticence, you may draw useful conclusions about the underlying issue.\u0027 That\u0027s what they said to me.\" \"And what is the underlying issue?\" \"Well,\" Connor said. \"They mentioned MicroCon several times.\" \"That high-tech company?\" \"Yes. The one that\u0027s being sold. Apparently it\u0027s a small company in Silicon Valley that makes specialized computer machinery. And there are political problems about the sale. They referred to those problems several times.\" \"So this murder has something to do with MicroCon?\" \"I think so.\" He shifted in his chair. \"By the way, what did you learn at U.S.C. about the tapes?\" \"For one thing, that they were duplicated.\" Connor nodded. \"I assumed that,\" he said. \"You did?\" \"Ishiguro would never give us the originals. The Japanese think everybody who is not Japanese is a barbarian, They mean it, literally: barbarian. Stinking, vulgar, stupid barbarian. They\u0027re polite about it, because they know you can\u0027t help the misfortune of not being born Japanese. But they still think it.\" I nodded. That was more or less what Sanders had said, too. \"The other thing,\" Connor said, \"is that the Japanese are extremely successful, but they are not daring. They are plotters and plodders. So they\u0027re not going to give us the originals because they don\u0027t want to take any chances. Now. What else did you learn about the tapes?\" \"What makes you think there was something else?\" I said. \"When you looked at the tapes,\" he said, \"I\u0027m sure you noticed an important detail that - \" And then we were interrupted by the telephone. \"Captain Connor,\" said a cheerful voice, over the speaker phone. \"This is Jerry Orr. Over at Sunset Hills Country Club? You left without taking the papers with you.\" \"The papers?\" \"The application,\" Orr said. \"You need to fill it out, Captain. Of course it\u0027s just routine. I can assure you, there won\u0027t be any problem with it, considering who your sponsors are.\" \"My sponsors,\" Connor said. \"Yes, sir,\" Orr said. \"And congratulations. As you know, it\u0027s almost impossible to obtain a membership at Sunset these days. But Mr. Hanada\u0027s company had already bought a corporate membership some time ago, and they have decided to put it in your name. I must say, it\u0027s a very nice gesture from your friends.\" \"Yes, it is,\" Connor said, frowning. I was looking at him. \"They know how fond you are of playing golf here,\" Orr said. \"You know the terms, of course. Hanada will purchase the membership over five years, but after that time, it\u0027ll be transferred to your name. So when you retire from club membership, you\u0027re free to sell it. Now: will you be picking up the paperwork here, or should I send it to your home?\" Connor said, \"Mr. Orr, please convey my heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Hanada for his very great generosity. I hardly know what to say. But I will have to call you back about this.\" \"That\u0027s fine. You just let us know where to send it.\" \"I\u0027ll call you back,\" Connor said. He pushed the button to end the call, and stared forward, frowning. There was a long silence. I said, \"How much is a membership at that club worth?\" \"Seven fifty. Maybe a million.\" I said, \"Pretty nice gift from your friends.\" I was thinking again of Graham, and the way Graham had always implied that Connor was in the pocket of the Japanese. There didn\u0027t seem to be much doubt of it now. Connor was shaking his head. \"I don\u0027t get it.\" \"What\u0027s not to get?\" I said. \"Jesus, Captain. Seems pretty straightforward to me.\" \"No, I don\u0027t get it,\" Connor said. And then the phone rang again. This time, it was for me. \"Lieutenant Smith? It\u0027s Louise Gerber. I\u0027m so glad I was able to reach you.\" I didn\u0027t recognize her name. I said, \"Yes?\" \"Since tomorrow is Saturday, I was wondering if you had any time to look at a house.\" Then I remembered who she was. A month earlier I had gone out with a broker to look at houses. Michelle is getting older, and I wanted to get her out of an apartment. To get her a backyard if I could. It was pretty discouraging. Even with a real estate slump, the smallest houses were four and five hundred thousand. I couldn\u0027t possibly qualify for that, on my salary. \"This is a very special situation,\" she said, \"and I thought of you and your little girl. It\u0027s a small house in Palms - very small - but it\u0027s a corner lot and it has a charming backyard. Flowers and a lovely lawn. The asking is three hundred. But the reason I thought of you is that the seller is willing to take back all the paper on it. I think you could get it for very little down. Do you want to see it?\" I said, \"Who is the seller?\" \"I don\u0027t really know. It\u0027s a special situation. The house is owned by an elderly woman who has gone into a nursing home and her son who lives in Topeka intends to sell it, but he wants an income flow instead of an outright sale. The property\u0027s not formally listed yet, but I know the seller is motivated. If you could get in tomorrow, you might be able to do something. And the backyard is charming. I can just see your little girl there.\" Now Connor was looking at me. I said, \"Miss Gerber, I\u0027d have to know more about it. Who the seller is, and so on. She sounded surprised. \"Gee, I thought you\u0027d jump at it. A situation like this doesn\u0027t come along very often. Don\u0027t you want to look at it?\" Connor was looking at me, nodding. He mouthed, say yes. \"I\u0027ll have to get back to you about this,\" I said. \"All right, Lieutenant,\" she said. She sounded reluctant. \"Please let me know.\" \"I will.\" I hung up. \"What the hell is going on?\" I said. Because there wasn\u0027t any way to get around it. Between us, we had just been offered a lot of money. A lot of money. Connor shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Is it to do with MicroCon?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I thought MicroCon was a small company. This doesn\u0027t make sense.\" He looked very uneasy. \"What exactly is MicroCon?\" I said, \"I think I know who to ask.\" Chapter 8 \"MicroCon?\" Ron Levine said, lighting a big cigar. \"Sure, I can tell you about MicroCon. It\u0027s an ugly story.\" We were sitting in the newsroom of American Financial Network, a cable news operation located near the airport. Through the window of Ron\u0027s office, I could see the white satellite dishes on the roof of the adjacent garage. Ron puffed on his cigar and grinned at us. He had been a financial reporter at the Times before taking an on-camera job here. AFN was one of the few television operations where the on-camera people weren\u0027t scripted; they had to know what they were talking about, and Ron did. \"MicroCon,\" he said, \"was formed five years ago by a consortium of American computer manufacturers. The company was intended to develop the next generation of X-ray lithography machines for computer chips. At the time MicroCon started up, there were no American manufacturers of lithography machines - they\u0027d all been put out of business in the eighties, under intense competition from the Japanese. MicroCon developed new technology, and has been building machines for American companies. Okay?\" \"Okay,\" I said. \"Two years ago, MicroCon was sold to Darley-Higgins, a management company in Georgia. Darley\u0027s other operations were foundering; the company decided to sell MicroCon to raise cash. They found a buyer in Akai Ceramics, an Osaka company that already made lithography machines in Japan. Akai had plenty of cash, and was willing to acquire the American company for a high price. Then Congress moved to stop the sale.\" \"Why?\" \"The decline of American business is starting to disturb even Congress. We\u0027ve lost too many basic industries to Japan - steel and shipbuilding in the sixties, television and computer chips in the seventies, machine tools in the eighties. One day somebody wakes up and realizes these industries are vital for American defense. We\u0027ve lost the ability to make components essential to our national security. We\u0027re entirely dependent on Japan to supply them. So Congress starts to worry. But I hear the sale is going through, anyway. Why? Do you guys have something to do with the sale?\" \"In a sense,\" Connor said. \"Lucky you,\" Ron said, puffing on his cigar. \"If you\u0027re involved in a sale to the Japanese, it\u0027s like striking oil. Everybody gets rich. You two are looking at some pretty big gifts, I imagine.\" Connor nodded. \"Very big.\" \"I\u0027m sure,\" Ron said. \"They\u0027ll take care of you: buy you a house or a car, get you cheap financing, something like that.\" I said, \"Why would they do that?\" Ron laughed. \"Why would they eat sushi? It\u0027s the way they conduct business.\" Connor said, \"But isn\u0027t MicroCon a small sale?\" \"Yeah, pretty small. The company\u0027s worth a hundred million. Akai\u0027s buying it for a hundred and fifty. On top of that, they probably have another twenty million in incentives to the current corporate officers, maybe ten million in legal, ten million in consultant fees spread around Washington, and ten million in miscellaneous gifts for people like you. So call it two hundred million, in total.\" I said, \"Two hundred million for a hundred-million company? Why are they paying more than it\u0027s worth?\" \"They\u0027re not,\" Ron said. \"As far as they\u0027re concerned, they\u0027re getting a bargain.\" \"Why\" \"Because,\" Ron said, \"if you own the machines that are used to make something, like computer chips, you own the downstream industries that depend on those machines. MicroCon will give them control over the American computer industry. And as usual, we\u0027re allowing it to happen. Just the way we lost our television industry, and our machine-tool industry.\" \"What happened to the TV industry?\" I said. He glanced at his watch. \"After World War II, America was the world\u0027s leading manufacturer of televisions. Twenty-seven American companies like Zenith, RCA, GE, and Emerson had a solid technological lead over foreign manufacturers. American companies were successful around the world, except in Japan. They couldn\u0027t penetrate the closed Japanese market. They were told if they wanted to sell in Japan, they had to license their technology to Japanese companies. And they did, reluctantly, under pressure from the American government, which wanted to keep Japan as a friendly ally against Russia. Okay?\" \"Okay...\" \"Now, licensing is a bad idea. It means Japan gets our technology for their own use, and we lose Japan as an export market. Pretty soon Japan begins to make cheap black-and-white TVs and exports them to America - something we can\u0027t do in Japan, right? By 1972, sixty percent of American black-and-white sales are imports. By 1976, one hundred percent are imports. We\u0027ve lost the black-and-white market. American workers don\u0027t make those sets any more. Those jobs are gone from America.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-26.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
