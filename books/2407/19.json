Why?\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking,\" Graham said. \"Maybe we should have the Japanese liaison on hand for this bust.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you wanted to do it alone.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, maybe you want to come over and help out with this bust. Just so everything is done by the book.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Is this a CYA?\" I meant cover your ass.\\n\\n \"Hey. You going to help me out, or not?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Tom. I\u0027m on my way.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll wait for you.\"\\n\\n Chapter 20\\n\\n Eddie Sakamura lived in a small house on one of those narrow twisting streets high in the Hollywood hills above the 101 freeway. It was 2:45 a.m. when I came around a curve and saw the two black and whites with their lights off, and Graham\u0027s tan sedan, parked to one side. Graham was standing with the patrolmen, smoking a cigarette. I had to go back a dozen meters to find a place to park. Then I walked over to them.\\n\\n We looked up at Eddie\u0027s house, built over a garage at street level. It was one of those two-bedroom white stucco houses from the 1940s. The lights were on, and we heard Frank Sinatra singing. Graham said, \"He\u0027s not alone. He\u0027s got some broads up there.\"\\n\\n I said, \"How do you want to handle it?\"\\n\\n Graham said, \"We leave the boys here. I told \u0027em no shooting, don\u0027t worry. You and I go up and make the bust.\"\\n\\n Steep stairs ran up from the garage to the house.\\n\\n \"Okay. You take the front and I\u0027ll take the back?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, no,\" Graham said. \"I want you with me, buddy. He\u0027s not dangerous, right?\"\\n\\n I saw the silhouette of a woman pass one of the windows. She looked naked. \"Shouldn\u0027t be,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Okay then, let\u0027s do it.\"\\n\\n We started up the stairs single file. Frank Sinatra was singing \"My Way.\" We heard the laughter of women. It sounded like more than one. \"Christ, I hope they got some fucking drugs out.\"\\n\\n I thought the chances of that were pretty good. We reached the top of the stairs, ducking to avoid being seen through the windows.\\n\\n The front door was Spanish, heavy and solid. Graham paused. I moved a few steps toward the back of the house, where I saw the greenish glow of pool lights. There was probably a back door going out to the pool. I was trying to see where it was.\\n\\n Graham tapped my shoulder. I came back. He gently turned the handle of the front door. It was unlocked. Graham took out his revolver and looked at me. I took out my gun.\\n\\n He paused, held up three fingers. Count of three.\\n\\n Graham kicked the front door open and went in low, shouting \"Hold it, police! Hold it right there!\" Before I got into the living room, I could hear the women screaming.\\n\\n There were two of them, completely naked, running around the room and shrieking at the top of their lungs, \"Eddie! Eddie!\" Eddie wasn\u0027t there. Graham was shouting, \"Where is he? Where is Eddie Sakamura?\" The redhead grabbed a pillow from the couch to cover herself, and screamed, \"Get out of here, you fucker!\" and then she threw the pillow at Graham. The other girl, a blonde, ran squealing into the bedroom. We followed her, and the redhead threw another pillow at us.\\n\\n In the bedroom, the blonde fell on the floor and howled in pain. Graham leaned over her with his gun. \"Don\u0027t shoot me!\" she cried. \"I didn\u0027t do anything!\"\\n\\n Graham grabbed her by the ankle. There was all this twisting bare flesh. The girl was hysterical. \"Where is Eddie?\" Graham said. \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"In a meeting!\" the girl squealed.\\n\\n \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"In a meeting!\" And flailing around, she kicked Graham in the nuts with her other leg.\\n\\n \"Aw, Christ,\" Graham said, letting the girl go. He coughed and sat down hard. I went back to the living room. The redhead had her high heels on but nothing else.\\n\\n I said, \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"You bastards,\" she said. \"You fucking bastards.\"\\n\\n I went past her toward a door at the far end of the room. It was locked. The redhead ran up and began to hit me on the back with her fists. \"Leave him alone! Leave him alone!\" I was trying to open the locked door while she pounded on me. I thought I heard voices from the other side of the door. In the next moment Graham\u0027s big bulk slammed into the door and the wood splintered. The door opened. I saw the kitchen, lit by the green light of the pool outside. The room was empty. The back door was open.\\n\\n \"Shit.\"\\n\\n By now the redhead had jumped on my back, and locked her legs around my waist. She was pulling my hair, screaming obscenities. I spun around in circles, trying to throw her off me. It was one of those strange moments where in the middle of all the chaos I was thinking, be careful, don\u0027t hurt her, because it would look bad for a pretty young girl to end up with a broken arm or cracked ribs, it would mean police brutality even though right now she was tearing my hair out by the roots. She bit my ear and I felt pain. I slammed myself back against the wall, and I heard her grunt as the breath was knocked out of her. She let go.\\n\\n Out the window, I saw a dark figure running down the stairs. Graham saw it, too.\\n\\n \"Fuck,\" he said. He ran. I ran, too. But the girl must have tripped me because I fell over, landing hard. When I got to my feet I heard the sirens of the black and whites and their engines starting up.\\n\\n Then I was back outside, running down the steps. I was maybe ten meters behind Graham, about thirty feet, when Eddie\u0027s Ferrari backed out of the garage, ground the gears, and roared down the street.\\n\\n The black and whites immediately took up pursuit. Graham ran for his sedan. He had pulled out to follow while I was still running for my own car, parked farther down the road. As his car flashed past me, I could see his face, grim and angry.\\n\\n I got into my car and followed.\\n\\n You can\u0027t drive fast in the hills and talk on the phone. I didn\u0027t even try. I estimated I was half a kilometer behind Graham, and he was some distance behind the two patrol cars. When I got to the bottom of the hill, the 101 overpass, I saw the flashing lights going down the freeway. I had to back up and pull around to the entrance below Mulholland, and then I joined traffic heading south.\\n\\n When the traffic began to slow up, I stuck my flasher on the roof, and pulled into the right-hand breakdown lane. I got to the concrete embankment about thirty seconds after the Ferrari hit it flat out at a hundred and sixty kilometers an hour. I guess the gas tank had exploded on impact, and the flames were jumping fifteen meters into the air. The heat was tremendous. It looked like the trees up on the hill might catch on fire. You couldn\u0027t get anywhere near the twisted wreck of the car.\\n\\n The first of the fire trucks pulled up, with three more black and whites. There were sirens and flashing lights everywhere.\\n\\n I backed up my car to make room for the trucks, then walked over to Graham. He smoked a cigarette as the firemen began to spray the wreck with foam.\\n\\n \"Christ,\" Graham said. \"What a fucking cockup.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t the backup patrolmen stop him when he was in the garage?\"\\n\\n \"Because,\" Graham said, \"I told them not to shoot at him. And we weren\u0027t there. They were trying to decide what to do when the guy drove away.\" He shook his head. \"This is going to look like shit in the report.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Still, it\u0027s probably better you didn\u0027t shoot him.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" He ground out his cigarette.\\n\\n By now, the firemen had gotten the fire out. The Ferrari was a smoking hulk crumpled against the concrete. There was a harsh smell in the air.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Graham said. \"No point staying around here. I\u0027ll go back up to the house. See if those girls are still there.\"\\n\\n \"You need me for anything else?\"\\n\\n \"No. You might as well go. Tomorrow is another day. Shit, it\u0027ll be paperwork until we drop.\" He looked at me. He hesitated. \"We in sync about this? About what happened?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, yes,\" I said.\\n\\n \"No way to handle it differently,\" he said. \"Far as I can see.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"Just one of those things.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, buddy. See you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Good night, Tom.\"\\n\\n We got into our cars.\\n\\n I drove home.\\n\\n Chapter 21\\n\\n Mrs. Ascenio was snoring loudly on the sofa. It was three forty-five in the morning. I tiptoed past her and looked in Michelle\u0027s room. My daughter lay on her back, her covers tossed aside, her arms flung over her head. Her feet stuck through the bars of the crib. I tucked the covers around her and went into my own room.\\n\\n The television was still on. I turned it off. I pulled off my tie and sat down on the bed to remove my shoes. I suddenly realized how tired I was. I took off my coat and trousers and threw them onto the television set. I lay down on my back and thought I should take off my shirt. It felt sweaty and grimy on my body. I closed my eyes for a moment and let my head sink back into the pillow. Then I felt a pinching, and something tugging at my eyelids. I heard a chirping sound and thought in a moment of horror that birds were pecking at my eyes.\\n\\n I heard a voice saying, \"Open your eyes, Daddy. Open your eyes.\" And I realized that it was my daughter, trying to pull my eyelids up with small fingers.\\n\\n \"Yuuuh,\" I said. I glimpsed daylight, rolled away, and buried my face in the pillow.\\n\\n \"Daddy? Open your eyes. Open your eyes, Daddy.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Daddy was out late last night. Daddy is tired.\"\\n\\n She paid no attention. \"Daddy, open your eyes. Open your eyes. Daddy? Open your eyes, Daddy.\"\\n\\n I knew that she would continue saying the same thing, over and over, until I lost my mind, or opened my eyes. I rolled onto my back and coughed. \"Daddy is still tired, Shelly. Go see what Mrs. Ascenio is doing.\"\\n\\n \"Daddy, open your eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you let Daddy sleep a while? Daddy wants to sleep a little longer this morning.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s morning now, Daddy. Open your eyes. Open your eyes.\"\\n\\n I opened my eyes. She was right.\\n\\n It was morning.\\n\\n What the hell.\\n\\n Second Day\\n\\n Chapter 1\\n\\n \"Eat your pancakes.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want any more.\"\\n\\n \"Just one more bite, Shelly.\" Sunlight streamed through the kitchen window. I yawned. It was seven o\u0027clock in the morning.\\n\\n \"Is Mommy coming today?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t change the subject. Come on, Shel. One more bite. Please?\"\\n\\n We were sitting at her kid-size table in the corner of the kitchen. Sometimes I can get her to eat at the little table when she won\u0027t eat at the big table. But I wasn\u0027t having much luck today. Michelle stared at me.\\n\\n \"Is Mommy coming?\"\\n\\n \"I think so. I\u0027m not sure.\" I didn\u0027t want to disappoint her. \"We\u0027re waiting to hear.\"\\n\\n \"Is Mommy going out of town again?\"\\n\\n I said, \"Maybe.\" I wondered what \"going out of town\" meant to a two-year-old, what sort of image she would have of it.\\n\\n \"Is she going with Uncle Rick?\"\\n\\n Who is Uncle Rick? I held the fork in front of her face. \"I don\u0027t know, Shel. Come on, open up. One more bite.\"\\n\\n \"He has a new car,\" Michelle said, nodding solemnly, the way she did whenever she was informing me of important news.\\n\\n \"Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Black one.\"\\n\\n \"I see. What kind of car is it?\"\\n\\n \"Sades.\"\\n\\n \"A Sades?\"\\n\\n \"No. Sades.\"\\n\\n \"You mean Mercedes?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Black one.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nice,\" I said.\\n\\n \"When is Mommy coming?\"\\n\\n \"One more bite, Shel.\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth, and I moved the fork toward her. At the last moment she turned her head aside, pursing her lips. \"No, Daddy.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said. \"I give up.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not hungry, Daddy.\"\\n\\n \"I can see that.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Ascenio was cleaning up the kitchen before she went back to her own apartment. There was another fifteen minutes before my housekeeper Elaine came to take Michelle to day care. I still had to get her dressed. I was putting her pancakes in the sink when the phone rang. It was Ellen Farley, the mayor\u0027s press aide.\\n\\n \"Are you watching?\"\\n\\n \"Watching what?\"\\n\\n \"The news. Channel seven. They\u0027re doing the car crash right now.\"\\n\\n \"They are?\"\\n\\n \"Call me back,\" she said.\\n\\n I went into the bedroom and turned on the television. A voice was saying, \" - reported a high-speed chase on the Hollywood freeway southbound, which ended when the suspect drove his Ferrari sportscar into the Vine Street overpass, not far from the Hollywood Bowl. Observers say the car hit the concrete embankment at more than a hundred miles an hour, instantly bursting into flames. Fire trucks were called to the scene but there were no survivors. The driver\u0027s body was so badly burned that his glasses melted. The officer in charge of the pursuit, Detective Thomas Graham, said that the driver, Mr. Edward Sakamura, was wanted in connection with the alleged murder of a woman at a downtown location. But today, friends of Mr. Sakamura expressed disbelief at this charge, and claimed that police strong-arm tactics panicked the suspect and caused him to flee. There are complaints that the incident was racially motivated. It is not clear whether police intended to charge Mr. Sakamura with the murder, and observers noted that this was the third high-speed pursuit on the 101 freeway in the last two weeks. Questions of police judgment in these pursuits have arisen after a Compton woman was killed in a high-speed pursuit last January. Neither Detective Graham nor his assistant Lieutenant Peter Smith was available to be interviewed, and we are waiting to hear if the officers will be disciplined or suspended by the department.\"\\n\\n Jesus.\\n\\n \"Daddy...\"\\n\\n \"Just a minute, Shel.\"\\n\\n The image showed the crumpled, smoking wreckage being loaded onto a flatbed truck for removal from the side of the highway. There was a black smear on the concrete where the car had struck the wall.\\n\\n The station cut back to the studio, where the anchorwoman faced the camera and said, \"In other developments, KNBC has learned that two police officers interviewed Mr. Sakamura earlier in the evening in connection with the case, but did not arrest him at that time. Captain John Connor and Lieutenant Smith may face disciplinary review by the department, with questions being raised of possible procedural violations. However, the good news is there are no longer delays for traffic moving southbound on the 101. Now over to you, Bob.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-19.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
