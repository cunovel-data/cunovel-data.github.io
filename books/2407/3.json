{"id":74706,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"There were two glass-walled conference rooms, on the left and right. The room on the right was smaller, and there I saw the body of the girl, lying on a long black table. She was wearing a black dress. One leg dangled down toward the floor. I didn\u0027t see any blood. But I was pretty far away from her, maybe sixty meters. It was hard to see much detail. I heard the crackle of police radios, and I heard Graham saying, \"Here\u0027s your liaison, gentlemen. Now maybe we can get started on our investigation. Peter?\" I turned to the Japanese men by the elevator. I didn\u0027t know which I should talk to; there was an awkward moment until one of them stepped forward. He was about thirty-five and wore an expensive suit. The man gave a very slight bow, from the neck, just a hint. I bowed back. Then he spoke. \"Konbanwa. Hajimemashite, Sumisu-san. Ishiguro desu. Dōzo yoroshiku.\" A formal greeting, although perfunctory. No wasted time. His name was Ishiguro. He already knew my name. I said, \"Hajimemashite. Watashi wa Sumisu desu. Dōzo yoroshiku.\" How do you do. Glad to meet you. The usual. \"Watashi no meishi desu. Dōzo.\" He gave me his business card. He was quick in his movements, brusque. \"Dōmo arigatō gozaimasu. \" I accepted his card with both hands, which wasn\u0027t really necessary, but taking Connor\u0027s advice, I wanted to do the most formal thing. Next I gave him my card. The ritual required us both to look at each other\u0027s cards, and to make some minor comment, or to ask a question like \"Is this your office telephone number?\" Ishiguro took my card with one hand and said, \"Is this your home phone, Detective?\" I was surprised. He spoke the kind of unaccented English you can only learn by living here for a long time, starting when you\u0027re young. He must have gone to school here. One of the thousands of Japanese who studied in America in the seventies. When they were sending 150,000 students a year to America, to learn about our country. And we were sending 200 American students a year to Japan. \"That\u0027s my number at the bottom, yes,\" I said. Ishiguro slipped my card into his shirt pocket. I started to make a polite comment about his card, but he interrupted me. \"Look, Detective. I think we can dispense with the formalities. The only reason there\u0027s a problem here tonight is that your colleague is unreasonable.\" \"My colleague?\" Ishiguro gave a head jerk. \"The fat one there. Graham. His demands are unreasonable, and we strongly object to his intention to carry out an investigation tonight.\" I said, \"Why is that, Mr. Ishiguro?\" \"You have no probable cause to conduct one.\" \"Why do you say that?\" Ishiguro snorted. \"I would think it\u0027s obvious, even to you.\" I stayed cool. Five years as a detective, and then a year in the press section had taught me to stay cool. I said, \"No, sir, I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not obvious.\" He looked at me disdainfully. \"The fact is, Lieutenant, you have no reason to connect this girl\u0027s death to the party we\u0027re holding downstairs.\" \"It looks like she\u0027s wearing a party dress - \u0027 He interrupted me rudely. \"My guess is you\u0027ll probably discover that she has died of an accidental drug overdose. And therefore her death has nothing to do with our party. Wouldn\u0027t you agree?\" I took a deep breath. \"No, sir, I wouldn\u0027t agree. Not without an investigation.\" I took another breath. \"Mr. Ishiguro, I appreciate your concerns, but - \" \"I wonder if you do,\" Ishiguro said, interrupting me again. \"I insist that you appreciate the position of the Nakamoto company tonight. This is a very significant evening for us, a very public evening. We are naturally distressed by the prospect that our function might be marred by unfounded allegations of a woman\u0027s death, especially this, a woman of no importance...\" \"A woman of no importance?\" Ishiguro made a dismissing wave. He seemed to be tired of talking to me. \"It\u0027s obvious, just look at her. She\u0027s no better than a common prostitute. I can\u0027t imagine how she came to be in this building at all. And for this reason, I strongly protest the intention of Detective Graham to interrogate the guests at the reception downstairs. That\u0027s entirely unreasonable. We have many senators, congressmen, and officials of Los Angeles among our guests. Surely you agree that such prominent people will find it awkward - \" I said, \"Just a minute. Detective Graham told you he was going to interrogate everybody at the reception?\" \"That is what he said to me. Yes.\" Now, at last, I began to understand why I\u0027d been called. Graham didn\u0027t like the Japanese and he had threatened to spoil their evening. Of course it was never going to happen. There was no way Graham was going to interrogate United States senators, let alone the district attorney or the mayor. Not if he expected to come to work tomorrow. But the Japanese annoyed him, and Graham had decided to annoy them back. I said to Ishiguro, \"We can set up a registration desk downstairs, and your guests can sign out as they leave.\" \"I am afraid that will be difficult,\" Ishiguro began, \"because surely you will admit - \" \"Mr. Ishiguro, that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do.\" \"But what you ask is extremely difficult - \" \"Mr. Ishiguro.\" \"You see, for us this is going to cause - \" \"Mr. Ishiguro, I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ve just told you what police procedure is going to be.\" He stiffened. There was a pause. He wiped some sweat from his upper lip and said, \"I am disappointed, Lieutenant, not to have greater cooperation from you.\" \"Cooperation?\" That was when I started to get pissed off. \"Mr. Ishiguro, you\u0027ve got a dead woman in there, and it is our job to investigate what happened to - \" \"But you must acknowledge our special circumstances - \" Then I heard Graham say, \"Aw, Christ, what is this?\" Looking over my shoulder, I saw a short, bookish Japanese man twenty meters beyond the yellow tape. He was taking pictures of the crime scene. The camera he held was so small it was nearly concealed in the palm of his hand. But he wasn\u0027t concealing the fact that he had crossed the tape barrier to take his pictures. As I watched, he moved slowly back toward us, raising his hands for a moment to snap a picture, then blinking behind his wire-frame spectacles as he selected his next shot. He was deliberate in his movements. Graham went up to the tape and said, \"For Christ\u0027s sake, get out of there. This is a crime scene. You can\u0027t take pictures in there.\" The man didn\u0027t respond. He kept moving backward. Graham turned away. \"Who is this guy?\" Ishiguro said, \"This is our employee, Mr. Tanaka. He works for Nakamoto Security.\" I couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The Japanese had their own employee wandering around inside the yellow tapes, contaminating the crime scene. It was outrageous. \"Get him out of there,\" I said. \"He is taking pictures.\" \"He can\u0027t do that.\" Ishiguro said, \"But this is for our corporate use.\" I said, \"I don\u0027t care, Mr. Ishiguro. He can\u0027t be inside the yellow tape, and he can\u0027t take pictures. Get him out of there. And I want his film, please.\" \"Very well.\" Ishiguro said something quickly in Japanese. I turned, just in time to see Tanaka slip under the yellow tape, and disappear among the blue-suited men clustered by the elevator. Behind their heads, I saw the elevator doors open and close. Son of a bitch. I was getting angry. \"Mr. Ishiguro, you are now obstructing an official police investigation.\" Ishiguro said calmly, \"You must try to understand our position, Detective Smith. Of course we have complete confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department, but we must be able to undertake our own private inquiry, and for that we must have - \" Their own private inquiry? The son of a bitch. I suddenly couldn\u0027t speak. I clenched my teeth, seeing red. I was furious. I wanted to arrest Ishiguro. I wanted to spin him around, shove him up against the wall, and snap the cuffs around his fucking wrists and - \"Perhaps I can be of assistance, Lieutenant,\" a voice behind me said. I turned. It was John Connor, smiling cheerfully. I stepped aside. Connor faced Ishiguro, bowed slightly, and presented his card. He spoke rapidly. \"Totsuzen shitsurei desuga, jiko-shōkai wo shitemo yoroshii desuka. Watashi wa John Connor to mōshimasu. Meishi o dōzo. Dōzo yoroshiku.\" \"John Connor?\" Ishiguro said. \"The John Connor? Omeni kakarete kōei desu. Watashi wa Ishiguro desu. Dōzo yoroshiku.\" He was saying he was honored to meet him. \"Watashi no meishi desu. Dōzo.\" A graceful thank you. But once the formalities were completed, the conversation went so quickly I caught only an occasional word. I was obliged to appear interested, watching and nodding, when in fact I had no idea what they were talking about. Once I heard Connor refer to me as wakaimono, which I knew meant his protege or apprentice. Several times, he looked at me severely, and shook his head like a regretful father. It seemed he was apologizing for me. I also heard him refer to Graham as bushitsuke, a disagreeable man. But these apologies had their effect. Ishiguro calmed down, dropping his shoulders. He began to relax. He even smiled. Finally he said, \"Then you will not check identification of our guests?\" \"Absolutely not,\" Connor said. \"Your honored guests are free to come and go as they wish.\" I started to protest. Connor shot me a look. \"Identification is unnecessary,\" Connor continued, speaking formally, \"because I am sure that no guest of the Nakamoto Corporation could ever be involved in such an unfortunate incident.\" \"Fucking A,\" Graham said, under his breath. Ishiguro was beaming. But I was furious. Connor had contradicted me. He had made me look like a fool. And on top of that, he wasn\u0027t following police procedure - we could all be in trouble for that later on. Angrily, I shoved my hands in my pockets and looked away. \"I am grateful for your delicate handling of this situation, Captain Connor,\" Ishiguro said. \"I have done nothing at all,\" Connor replied, making another formal bow. \"But I hope you will now agree it is appropriate to clear the floor, so the police may begin their investigation.\" Ishiguro blinked. \"Clear the floor?\" \"Yes,\" Connor said, taking out a notebook. \"And please assist me to know the names of the gentlemen standing behind you, as you ask them to leave.\" \"I am sorry?\" \"The names of the gentlemen behind you, please.\" \"May I ask why?\" Connor\u0027s face darkened, and he barked a short phrase in Japanese. I didn\u0027t catch the words, but Ishiguro turned bright red. \"Excuse me, Captain, but I see no reason for you to speak in this - \" And then, Connor lost his temper. Spectacularly and explosively. He moved close to Ishiguro, making sharp stabbing motions with his finger while he shouted: \"Iikagen ni shiro! Soko o doke! Kiiterunoka!\" Ishiguro ducked and turned away, stunned by this verbal assault. Connor leaned over him, his voice hard and sarcastic: \"Doke! Doke! Wakaranainoka?\" He turned, and pointed furiously toward the Japanese men by the elevator. Confronted with Connor\u0027s naked anger, the Japanese looked away, and puffed anxiously on their cigarettes. But they did not leave. \"Hey, Richie,\" Connor said, calling to the crime unit photographer Richie Walters. \"Get me some IDs of these guys, will you?\" \"Sure, Captain,\" Richie said. He raised his camera and began moving down the line of men, firing his strobe in quick succession. Ishiguro suddenly got excited, stepping in front of the camera, holding up his hands. \"Wait a minute, wait a minute, what is this?\" But the Japanese men were already leaving, wheeling away like a school of fish from the strobe flash. In a few seconds they were gone. We had the floor to ourselves. Alone, Ishiguro looked uncomfortable. He said something in Japanese. Apparently it was the wrong thing. \"Oh?\" Connor said. \"You are to blame here,\" he said to Ishiguro. \"You are the cause of all these troubles. And you will see that my detectives get any assistance they need. I want to speak to the person who discovered the body, and the person who called in the original report. I want the name of every person who has been on this floor since the body was discovered. And I want the film from Tanaka\u0027s camera. Ore wa honkida. I will arrest you if you obstruct this investigation further.\" \"But I must consult my superiors - \" \"Namerunayo.\" Connor leaned close. \"Don\u0027t fuck with me, Ishiguro-san. Now leave, and let us work.\" \"Of course, Captain,\" he said. With a tight, brief bow he left, his face pinched and unhappy. Graham chuckled. \"You told him off pretty good.\" Connor spun. \"What were you doing, telling him you were going to interrogate everybody at the party?\" \"Aw, shit, I was just winding him up,\" Graham said. \"There\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to interrogate the mayor. Can I help it if these assholes have no sense of humor?\" \"They have a sense of humor,\" Connor said. \"And the joke is on you. Because Ishiguro had a problem, and he solved it with your help.\" \"My help?\" Graham was frowning. \"What\u0027re you talking about?\" \"It\u0027s clear the Japanese wanted to delay the investigation,\" Connor said. \"Your aggressive tactics gave them the perfect excuse - to call for the Special Services liaison.\" \"Oh, come on,\" Graham said. \"For all they know, the liaison could have been here in five minutes.\" Connor shook his head. \"Don\u0027t kid yourself: they knew exactly who was on call tonight. They knew exactly how far away Smith would be, and exactly how long it would take him to get here. And they managed to delay the investigation an hour and a half. Nice work, detective.\" Graham stared at Connor for a long moment. Then he turned away. \"Fuck,\" he said. \"That\u0027s a load of bullshit, and you know it. Fellas, I\u0027m going to work. Richie? Mount up. You got thirty seconds to document before my guys come in and step on your tail. Let\u0027s go, everybody. I want to get finished before she starts to smell too bad.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-3.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
