Now, are you two going to fill me in? Because it looks to me like this little girl was going to get in trouble, sooner or later. I mean, she\u0027s cute, but she\u0027s screwed up. So... what is the big deal? Why am I out of bed in the middle of the night to do a careful, documented post on some little gasper?\"\\n\\n I said, \"Beats me.\"\\n\\n \"Come on. Fair is fair,\" Dr. Tim said. \"I showed you mine, now you show me yours.\"\\n\\n \"Why, Tim,\" Connor said. \"You made a joke.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck you,\" Tim said. \"You guys owe me. Come on.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid Peter is telling you the truth,\" Connor said. \"All we know is that this murder occurred at the time of a big public Japanese reception, and they are eager to get it cleared up right away.\"\\n\\n \"That makes sense,\" Tim said. \"The last time the shit hit the fan around here, it was because of that thing involving the Japanese consulate. Remember, the Takashima kidnapping case? Maybe you don\u0027t remember: it never made the papers. The Japanese managed to keep it very quiet. But anyway, a guard was killed under odd circumstances, and for two days, they put a hell of a pressure on our office. I was amazed what they could do. We had Senator Rowe calling us in person, telling us what to do. The governor calling in person. Everybody calling us. You\u0027d think it was the president\u0027s kid. I mean, these people have influence.\"\\n\\n \"Of course they do. They\u0027ve paid handsomely for it,\" Graham said, coming into the room.\\n\\n \"Close the door,\" Tim said.\\n\\n \"But this time, all their fucking influence won\u0027t help,\" Graham said. \"Because this time, we have them by the short and curlies. We have a murder: and based on the lab results so far, we can say without question that the murderer was Japanese.\"\\n\\n Chapter 17\\n\\n The pathology lab next door was a large room lit by even banks of fluorescent lights. Rows of microscopes, neatly laid out. But late at night, only two technicians were working in the big space. And Graham was standing beside them, gloating.\\n\\n \"Look for yourself. Pubic hair comb-through reveals male pubic hair, moderate curl, ovoid cross section, almost certainly Asian in origin. The first semen analysis is blood type: AB, relatively rare among Caucasians, but much more common among Asians. The first analysis of protein in the seminal fluid comes up negative for the genetic marker for... what\u0027s it called?\"\\n\\n \"Ethanol dehydrogenase,\" the technician said.\\n\\n \"Right. Ethanol dehydrogenase. It\u0027s an enzyme. Missing in Japanese. And missing in this seminal fluid. And there\u0027s the Diego factor, which is a blood-group protein. So. We have more tests coming, but it seems clear that this girl had forced sex with a Japanese man before she was killed by him.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s clear you\u0027ve found evidence of Japanese semen in her vagina,\" Connor said. \"That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Christ,\" Graham said. \"Japanese semen, Japanese pubic hair, Japanese blood factors. We are talking a Japanese perp here.\"\\n\\n He had set out some pictures from the crime scene, showing Cheryl lying on the boardroom table. He started to pace back and forth in front of them.\\n\\n \"I know where you guys have been, and I know you\u0027ve been wasting your time,\" Graham said. \"You went for videotapes: but they\u0027re gone, right? Then you went to her apartment: but it was cleaned up before you ever got there. Which is exactly what you\u0027d expect if the perp is Japanese. It lays right out, plain as can be.\"\\n\\n Graham pointed to the pictures. \"There\u0027s our girl. Cheryl Austin from Texas. She\u0027s cute. Fresh. Good figure. She\u0027s an actress, sort of. She does a few commercials. Maybe a Nissan commercial. Whatever. She meets some people. Makes some contacts. Gets on some lists. You with me?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said to Graham. Connor was staring intently at the pictures.\\n\\n \"One way or another, our Cheryl\u0027s doing well enough to be wearing a black Yamamoto gown when she gets invited to the grand opening of the Nakamoto Tower. She comes with some guy, maybe a friend or a hairdresser. A beard. Maybe she knows other people at the party, and maybe not. But in the course of the evening, somebody big and powerful suggests they slip away for a while. She agrees to go upstairs. Why not? This girl likes adventure. She likes danger. She\u0027s cruising for a bruising. So she goes upstairs - maybe with the other guy, maybe separately. But anyway, they meet upstairs, and they look around for a place to do it. A place that\u0027s exciting. And they decide - him, probably, he decides - to do it right on the fucking boardroom table. So they start doing it, they\u0027re whanging away but things get out of hand. Her loverboy gets a little too worked up, or else he\u0027s kinky, and... he squeezes her neck a little too hard. And she\u0027s dead. You with me so far?\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Yes...\"\\n\\n \"So now loverboy has a problem. He\u0027s come upstairs to fuck a girl, but unfortunately he\u0027s killed her. So what does he do? What can he do? He goes back down, rejoins the party, and since he is a big samurai cocksman, he tells one of his underlings that he has this little problem. He has unfortunately snuffed out the life of a local whore. Very inconvenient for his busy schedule. So the underlings run around and clean up the boss\u0027s mess. They clean up incriminating evidence from the floor upstairs. They remove the videotapes. They go to her apartment and remove evidence there. Which is all fine, except it takes time. So somebody has to stall the police. And that\u0027s where their smoothie suckass lawyer Ishiguro comes in. He delays us a good hour and a half. So. How does that sound?\"\\n\\n There was a silence when he had finished. I waited for Connor to speak.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Connor said, at last. \"My hat is off to you, Tom. That sequence of events sounds correct in many respects.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re damned right it does.\" Graham puffed up. \"Damn fucking right.\"\\n\\n The telephone rang. The lab technician said, \"Is there a Captain Connor here?\"\\n\\n Connor went to answer the phone. Graham said to me, \"I\u0027m telling you. A Jap killed this girl, and we are going to find him and fucking flay him. Flay him.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Why do you have it in for them, anyway?\"\\n\\n Graham gave me a sullen look. He said, \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m talking about how you hate the Japanese.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, listen,\" Graham said. \"Let\u0027s get something straight, Petey-san. I don\u0027t hate anybody. I do my job. Black man, white man, Japanese man, it makes no difference to me.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Tom.\" It was late at night. I didn\u0027t want to argue.\\n\\n \"No, hell. You fucking think I\u0027m prejudiced.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s just drop it, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"No, hell. We\u0027re not going to drop it. Not now. Let me tell you something, Petey-san. You got yourself this fucking liaison job, isn\u0027t that right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"And how come you applied for it? Because of your great love of Japanese culture?\"\\n\\n \"Well, at the time, I was working in the press office - \"\\n\\n \"No, no, cut the shit. You applied for it,\" Graham said, \"because there was an extra stipend, isn\u0027t that right? Two, three thousand a year. An educational stipend. It comes into the department from the Japan-America Amity Foundation. And the department allows it as an educational stipend, paid to members of the force so that they can further their education in Japanese language and culture. So. How\u0027re those studies going, Petey-san?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m studying.\"\\n\\n \"How often?\"\\n\\n \"One night a week.\"\\n\\n \"One night a week. And if you miss classes, do you lose your stipend?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Fucking right you don\u0027t. In fact, it doesn\u0027t make any difference if you go to classes at all. The fact is, buddy, you got yourself a bribe. You got three thousand dollars in your pocket and it comes right from the land of the rising sun. Of course, it\u0027s not that much. Nobody can buy you for three grand, right? Of course not.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Tom - \"\\n\\n \"But the thing is, they aren\u0027t buying you. They\u0027re just influencing you. They just want you to think twice. To tend to look favorably upon them. And why not? It\u0027s human nature. They\u0027ve made your life a little better. They contribute to your well-being. Your family. Your little girl. They scratch your back, so why shouldn\u0027t you scratch theirs? Isn\u0027t that about it; Petey-san?\"\\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" I said. I was getting angry.\\n\\n \"Yes, it is,\" Graham said. \"Because that\u0027s how influence works. It\u0027s deniable. You say it isn\u0027t there. You tell yourself it isn\u0027t there - but it is. The only way you can be clean is to be clean, man. If you got no stake in it, if you got no income from it, then you can talk. Otherwise, man, they pay you and I say, they own you.\"\\n\\n \"Just a fucking minute - \"\\n\\n \"So don\u0027t you talk to me about hating, man. This country is in a war and some people understand it, and some other people are siding with the enemy. Just like in World War II, some people were paid by Germany to promote Nazi propaganda. New York newspapers published editorials right out of the mouth of Adolf Hitler. Sometimes the people didn\u0027t even know it. But they did it. That\u0027s how it is in a war, man. And you are a fucking collaborator.\"\\n\\n I was grateful when, at that moment, Connor came back to where we were standing. Graham and I were about to square off when Connor said calmly, \"Now, just so I understand, Tom. According to your scenario, after the girl was murdered, what happened to the tapes?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, hell, those tapes are gone,\" Graham said. \"You\u0027re never going to see those tapes again.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s interesting. Because that call was the division headquarters. It seems Mr. Ishiguro is there. And he\u0027s brought a box of videotapes with him, for me to look at.\"\\n\\n Connor and I drove over. Graham took his own car. I said, \"Why did you say the Japanese would never touch Graham?\"\\n\\n \"Graham\u0027s uncle,\" Connor said. \"He was a prisoner of war during World War II. He was taken to Tokyo, where he disappeared. Graham\u0027s father went over after the war to find out what happened to him. There were unpleasant questions about what happened. You probably know that some American servicemen were killed in terminal medical experiments in Japan. There were stories about the Japanese feeding their livers to subordinates as a joke, things like that.\"\\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t know,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I think everybody would prefer to forget that time,\" Connor said, \"and move on. And probably correctly. It\u0027s a different country now. What was Graham going on about?\"\\n\\n \"My stipend as a liaison officer.\"\\n\\n Connor said, \"You told me it was fifty a week.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a little more than that.\"\\n\\n \"How much more?\"\\n\\n \"About a hundred dollars a week. Fifty-five hundred a year. But that\u0027s to cover classes, and books, and commuting expenses, baby-sitters, everything.\"\\n\\n \"So you get five grand,\" Connor said. \"So what?\"\\n\\n \"Graham was saying I was influenced by it. That the Japanese had bought me.\"\\n\\n Connor said, \"Well, they certainly try to do that. And they\u0027re extremely subtle.\"\\n\\n \"They tried it with you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure.\" He paused. \"And often I accepted. Giving gifts to ensure that you will be seen favorably is something the Japanese do by instinct. And it\u0027s not so different from what we do, when we invite the boss over for dinner. Goodwill is goodwill. But we don\u0027t invite the boss over for dinner when we\u0027re up for a promotion. The proper thing to do is to invite the boss early in the relationship, when nothing is at stake. Then it\u0027s just goodwill. The same with the Japanese. They believe you should give the gift early, because then it is not a bribe. It is a gift. A way of making a relationship with you before there is any pressure on the relationship.\"\\n\\n \"And you think that\u0027s okay?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s the way the world works.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think it\u0027s corrupting?\"\\n\\n Connor looked at me and said, \"Do you?\"\\n\\n I took a long time to answer. \"Yes. I think maybe so.\"\\n\\n He started to laugh. \"Well, that\u0027s a relief,\" he said. \"Because otherwise, the Japanese would have wasted all their money on you.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so funny?\"\\n\\n \"Your confusion, kōhai.\"\\n\\n \"Graham thinks it\u0027s a war.\"\\n\\n Connor said, \"Well, that\u0027s true. We are definitely at war with Japan. But let\u0027s see what surprises Mr. Ishiguro has for us in the latest skirmish.\"\\n\\n Chapter 18\\n\\n As usual, the fifth-floor anteroom of the downtown detective division was busy, even at two o\u0027clock in the morning. Detectives moved among the beat-up prostitutes and twitching druggies brought in for questioning; in the corner a man in a checked sport coat was shouting, \"I said, shut the fuck up!\" over and over to a female officer with a clipboard.\\n\\n In all the swirl and noise, Masao Ishiguro looked distinctly out of place. Wearing his blue pinstripe suit, he sat in the corner with his head bowed and his knees pressed together. He had a cardboard box balanced on his knees.\\n\\n When he saw us, he jumped to his feet. He bowed deeply, placing his hands flat on his thighs, a sign of additional respect. He held the bow for several seconds. Then he immediately bowed again, and this time he waited, bent over, staring at the floor, until Connor spoke to him in Japanese. Ishiguro\u0027s reply, also in Japanese, was quiet and deferential. He kept looking at the floor.\\n\\n Tom Graham pulled me over by the water cooler. \"Holy Christ,\" he said. \"It looks like we got a fucking confession happening here.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, maybe,\" I said. I wasn\u0027t convinced. I\u0027d seen Ishiguro change his demeanor before.\\n\\n I watched Connor as he talked to Ishiguro. The Japanese man remained hangdog. He kept looking at the floor.\\n\\n \"I never would have figured him,\" Graham said. \"Not in a million years. Never him.\"\\n\\n \"How is that?\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? To kill the girl, and then to stay in the room, and order us around. What fucking nerves of steel. But look at him now: Christ, he\u0027s almost crying.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-16.html","bookId":2407,"book":{"id":2407,"title":"Rising Sun","description":"Storyline: During the grand opening celebration of the new American headquarters of an immense Japanese conglomerate, the dead body of a beautiful woman is found.
