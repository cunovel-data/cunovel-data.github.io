{"id":43794,"no":20,"title":"Chapter XX","content":"Saturday, 2nd July 1892. \\n\\n \\n\\n The character of my handwriting is explained, alas! by scrivener’s cramp. This also explains how long I have let the paper lie plain. \\n\\n \\n\\n 1 P. M. \\n\\n \\n\\n I was busy copying David Balfour with my left hand — a most laborious task — Fanny was down at the native house superintending the floor, Lloyd down in Apia, and Belle in her own house cleaning, when I heard the latter calling on my name. I ran out on the verandah; and there on the lawn beheld my crazy boy with an axe in his hand and dressed out in green ferns, dancing. I ran downstairs and found all my house boys on the back verandah, watching him through the dining-room. I asked what it meant? — ‘Dance belong his place,’ they said. — ‘I think this no time to dance,’ said I. ‘Has he done his work?’ — ‘No,’ they told me, ‘away bush all morning.’ But there they all stayed on the back verandah. I went on alone through the dining-room, and bade him stop. He did so, shouldered the axe, and began to walk away; but I called him back, walked up to him, and took the axe out of his unresisting hands. The boy is in all things so good, that I can scarce say I was afraid; only I felt it had to be stopped ere he could work himself up by dancing to some craziness. Our house boys protested they were not afraid; all I know is they were all watching him round the back door and did not follow me till I had the axe. As for the out boys, who were working with Fanny in the native house, they thought it a very bad business, and made no secret of their fears. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wednesday, 6th. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have no account to give of my stewardship these days, and there’s a day more to account for than mere arithmetic would tell you. For we have had two Monday Fourths, to bring us at last on the right side of the meridian, having hitherto been an exception in the world and kept our private date. Business has filled my hours sans intermission. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tuesday, 12th \\n\\n \\n\\n I am doing no work and my mind is in abeyance. Fanny and Belle are sewing-machining in the next room; I have been pulling down their hair, and Fanny has been kicking me, and now I am driven out. Austin I have been chasing about the verandah; now he has gone to his lessons, and I make believe to write to you in despair. But there is nothing in my mind; I swim in mere vacancy, my head is like a rotten nut; I shall soon have to begin to work again or I shall carry away some part of the machinery. I have got your insufficient letter, for which I scorn to thank you. I have had no review by Gosse, none by Birrell; another time if I have a letter in the Times, you might send me the text as well; also please send me a cricket bat and a cake, and when I come home for the holidays, I should like to have a pony. \\n\\n \\n\\n I am, sir, your obedient servant, \\n\\n \\n\\n Jacob Tonson. \\n\\n \\n\\n P.S. I am quite well; I hope you are quite well. The world is too much with us, and my mother bids me bind my hair and lace my bodice blue. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1389/41615.html","bookId":1427,"book":{"id":1427,"title":"Vailima Letters","description":"简介： My Dear Colvin,This is a hard and interesting and beautiful life that we lead now.
