But when Avery Morgansten comes crashing into his life – literally – he finally meets the one person who can resist his soulful baby blues. But Cam’s not ready to give up. He can’t get the feisty and intriguing girl out of his head. Avery has secrets, secrets that keep her from admitting the feelings Cam knows she has for him. Will persistence (and some delicious homemade cookies) help him break down her barriers and gain her trust? Or will he be shut out of Avery\u0027s life, losing his first real shot at the kind of love that lasts forever?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/trust-in-me-wait-for-you-0.jpg","author":"Jennifer L.
