{"id":17287,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII TWO CAPTURES","content":"The meal was a very short one, but the ladies, to please their rescuers, took a few spoonfuls of soup and a glass of wine. Madame Pickard and her elder daughter were too much worn out by anxiety and emotion to talk, Monsieur Pickard was no less moved, and the conversation was supported entirely by the three officers and Louise. The young men hurried through their meal, and then, saying good-night to the others, went up on deck. \"Well, never did a thing turn out better,\" Nat said as he lit his pipe; \"it is a tremendous satisfaction that we have not lost a single man in the affair.\"[Pg 233] \"And it is no less a satisfaction,\" Turnbull said, \"that we have given a good many of those black brutes their deserts. It was a good fight for a bit.\" As they were smoking, the seven white men came up in a body. \"We could not lie down, monsieur,\" one of them said, \"till we had come to thank you for saving us from the most frightful deaths. We had given up all hopes even of obtaining a weapon and putting an end to ourselves, which we should certainly have done could we have got hold of a knife, after having been obliged to witness the tortures of two of our comrades. Had you been but ten minutes later another of us would have been their victim. Ah, monsieur! your voice, when you spoke at the window, seemed like that of an angel who had come to our relief.\" \"How long had you been in the woods?\" Nat asked. \"Six weeks, monsieur, before the negroes found us. We had carried off some provisions with us, but these were all consumed, and we were obliged to go down to the plantation to search for food. We suppose that we were seen and followed, and the next night we were surrounded by the band you saw.\" \"Well, we are all very glad to have got you out of their hands, and you rendered good service when the blacks came down on us.\" \"We had our revenge to take,\" the man said, \"and not one of us but would have fought until he was killed.\" \"You have had something to eat, I hope?\" \"Yes, thank you, sir.\" \"You had better turn in now. I don\u0027t suppose you have had much sleep of late.\" \"Poor beggars,\" Turnbull said as the men walked away, \"I wonder myself that they did not strangle each other, or hang themselves, or something. I am sure I should have done so[Pg 234] rather than wait day after day till my turn came to be burnt alive, or to be cut to pieces gradually, or put to death by any other means of slow torture.\" \"Yes, Turnbull, if one were quite sure that there was no possible hope of rescue or escape; but I suppose a man never does quite give up hope. This was an example, you see, of the unlikely happening.\" \"What are you going to do next, Glover?\" \"I don\u0027t know, I have hardly thought it out yet. You see, we can manage with this lot we have on board without much difficulty, and I don\u0027t know that I should be justified in going round to Cape Fran?ois on purpose to land them. So far we have not been able to bring any news of value, and at any rate I think we might as well cruise about here a little longer. There is one thing, if we should fall in with anyone bigger than ourselves and have to fight for it, those fellows who have just gone below will be a valuable addition to our strength. When it comes to a hand-to-hand fight seven stout fellows might turn the scale.\" \"Yes, there is something in that, and I am glad you mean to keep them on board for a bit. I think the girls will be very good fun when they have a little got over what they have gone through. The young one is a jolly little thing, and her sister is very pretty, in spite of her short hair and boy\u0027s dress, though one had not much opportunity of forming an idea as to whether she had any fun in her.\" \"I fancy it will be some time before she will feel inclined for a flirtation, Turnbull,\" Nat laughed. \"What she has gone through, and what she has seen in the way of horrors, is enough to damp a girl\u0027s spirits for a very long time.\" In the morning the ladies did not appear at breakfast. \"My wife is completely prostrated,\" Monsieur Pickard said, \"and the two girls are shy and do not like showing themselves[Pg 235] until they have made up a couple of dresses. Your steward gave them the roll of white cotton early this morning and needles and thread, and both are very hard at work. I hope you will excuse them, they will come out and have breakfast here after we have done. May I ask where we are sailing now?\" \"We are sailing east, monsieur. I hope that it will not inconvenience you to be a few days on board. My orders are to cruise up and down the coast, and I wish therefore to go east as far as the boundary between the French and Spanish portions of the island; after that I can go round into the bay of Hayti and land you at Port-au-Prince or Cape Fran?ois, whichever you would prefer.\" \"It will make no difference whatever to us, and indeed I am sure that a cruise on your beautiful little ship will be the very best thing for my wife and daughters. They will have perfect rest and sea air, and it will not be necessary for them to tell over and over again the stories of their sufferings; but I lament that we should be putting you to such personal inconvenience.\" \"I can assure you, monsieur, that you are putting us to no inconvenience whatever. We sleep just as well in our cots as in our berths, and the society of the ladies and yourself will be a very great pleasure to us, for as a rule we have very small opportunity in that way.\" \"You speak our language very fluently, Monsieur Glover.\" \"I am afraid that I speak it more fluently than grammatically. I had the opportunity of picking it up by ear last year, when I was staying for six weeks at the house of Monsieur Duchesne at Cape Fran?ois.\" \"We know him well, and his charming wife and daughter,\" Monsieur Pickard said, \"for we have a house there, and generally go there for three months every winter. Can it be that[Pg 236] you are the officer who saved their daughter\u0027s life, when she was attacked by a fierce hound?\" \"Yes, I had that good fortune.\" \"I fear that they have fallen in this terrible insurrection. We have had no direct news from Cape Fran?ois, but we heard that in their district all the plantations have been destroyed and the owners murdered.\" \"I am happy to be able to tell you that they were saved. I was staying there at the time when the revolt broke out We were warned just in time by an old nurse, Dinah.\" \"I remember her,\" Monsieur Pickard broke in, \"a tall old woman.\" \"Yes, Monsieur Duchesne himself was in town, and madame, Myra, and I had just time to gain the forest. There we were joined by Dinah, who did everything for us. Madame was attacked by fever, but fortunately Dinah knew of a very safe place of refuge. She did everything for us, fetched up provisions, concocted medicine, and after being ten days in hiding, we were able to get them down to the town.\" Both the midshipmen had a fair knowledge of French, though they were not able to speak it with Nat\u0027s ease and fluency. When the latter had finished, Turnbull broke in: \"Mr. Glover does not tell you, monsieur, that the cave they were in was attacked by six negroes, led by two mulattoes, and he shot them all, nor that he and the nurse carried Madame Duchesne down in a litter some twenty miles to the town, although he had one of his ribs broken by a pistol shot.\" \"What is the use of talking about that?\" Nat said angrily. \"The thing was done and there was an end of it. There has been a lot too much said about it as it is.\" Monsieur Pickard smiled. \"Monsieur Glover is like my daughters at present, he is shy. He should not be so. It is[Pg 237] right that we, his friends,—for we are his friends, now and for the rest of our lives,—should know what he is. Ah, my wife and the girls will be pleased indeed to hear that their friends have escaped! They have often said how sorry they were that they had not seen the young officer who rescued their friend Myra from the dog. It is strange indeed that he should afterwards have saved her and her mother from the negroes, and should now have so rescued us.\" That evening the girls appeared on deck in snowy-white dresses, simply made, but fitting admirably. \"We have always been accustomed to cut out our own dresses,\" Valerie said, laughing, when Nat complimented her on the work. \"The slaves did the sewing, but we fitted each other. Of course at Cape Fran?ois we had our dresses made for us, but on the plantation we were obliged to trust to ourselves.\" One morning, three days later, as they were at breakfast, Nat stopped as he was raising a cup to his lips. \"That is a gun!\" he exclaimed. \"There is another!\" and with the two middies he ran up on deck. \"There is a fight going on somewhere,\" he said as the sound of firing was again heard. \"It must be six or seven miles away, somewhere beyond that headland. At any rate we will hold on and have a look at them. With this light wind it will take us from an hour and a half to two hours before we are up with them, so we may as well finish our breakfast in comfort.\" \"What is it, Monsieur Glover! Are those noises really the sound of guns?\" \"There is no doubt about it. There is a fight going on seven or eight miles away. We should hear the sound more plainly were it not that there is a headland between us and the vessels engaged.\" \"Who can they be?\" Madame Pickard said. \"A pirate and a merchantman, no doubt. None of the[Pg 238] European nations are at war, but the seas swarm with piratical craft of one kind or another. The small ones content themselves with plundering native coasting vessels, the larger ones attack ships from or to Europe. The Orpheus, to which I belonged at that time, last year rooted out one of their worst nests. They had no fewer than four ships. We were lucky enough to catch one of them, and learned where the rendezvous was, and fortunately found the other three at home, and destroyed them and their storehouses.\" \"Are you going on in that direction now?\" Valerie asked. \"Yes, we are going to have a look at them. If the trader is making a good fight of it, our arrival may turn the scale; if we arrive too late and find the enemy too big for us, we can run away; in a light wind like this there are very few vessels that could catch us. It is probable that we should not interfere were it not for the possibility that we may be in time to save some of the passengers and crew of the merchantman. She must be a vessel of some size, judging from the sound of her guns. Even if she has surrendered before we get there, and we find that we are in any way a match for the pirate, we might, after defeating her, save at least some of the captives. As a rule, these scoundrels, when all opposition has ceased, confine the prisoners in the hold, and after emptying the prize of everything valuable, scuttle her, and of course drown all on board. In that way all traces of their crime are lost, whereas if they killed them some of the bodies might float inshore, or if they burnt the ship the smoke might bring down any cruiser that happened to be in the neighborhood. \"I am sorry that you are on board, ladies.\" \"Oh, do not think of us!\" Madame Pickard exclaimed. \"After the wonderful deliverance that we have had, I am sure that none of us would mind any risk if there is a chance of saving others in as dire peril as we were.\"[Pg 239] The two girls and Monsieur Pickard warmly agreed. \"Please put us altogether out of consideration,\" the latter said. \"Even if we knew that it was probable we should all lose our lives we should not hesitate. We are not, I hope, any of us, afraid of death. It was the kind of death that we were terrified at.\" \"I thank you all,\" Nat said gravely. \"I shall not fight unless I think that there is at any rate a fair chance of victory.\" On going on deck when breakfast was finished, Nat ordered the magazine to be opened and ammunition brought up. The wind had freshened a little, and the schooner was going faster through the water; and in three quarters of an hour after hearing the first gun they neared the promontory. \"I am afraid it is all over,\" Nat said to the ladies, who had also come on deck; \"there has not been a gun fired for the past two or three minutes. However, we shall soon see.\" On rounding the point they saw two vessels lying side by side, a mile and a half distant, and about a mile from shore. One was a barque, evidently a large merchantman; the other a brigantine. There was no question that the latter was a pirate, and the other her prize. The sailors, after a glance at them, turned their eyes anxiously towards Nat for orders. The latter stood quietly examining the ships through his glass. \"She mounts five guns a side, and I should say that they are about the same weight as our own,\" he said to Turnbull; \"and from the men swarming on her deck and that of her prize she must have nearly, if not quite, three times our strength, even counting the Frenchmen in.\" \"She is too big to fight squarely, sir,\" Turnbull reluctantly agreed. \"I am afraid she is altogether too tough a customer for us; and yet one hates the thought of leaving them to complete their devil\u0027s work on their prize.\"[Pg 240] \"Yes, we can\u0027t think of doing that, Mr. Turnbull. The first thing to do will be to draw them off from her.\" \"But they would be sure to leave some of their men in possession of her.\" \"Well, if they do, there will be so many the fewer for us to fight. We are within a mile now, I should say?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then train the two forward guns on them, and let them see that we mean fighting.\" A cheer broke from the sailors clustered round the guns as Turnbull gave the order. \"Now, ladies,\" Nat said, \"you can stop to see the effect of our first shot, and then I must ask you to go down on to the lower deck. Sam will show you the way and take some cushions down for you; you will be out of danger there.\" As he spoke, the two guns which were already loaded were fired, and the men gave a cheer as two white patches appeared on the side of the brigantine. \"Please hurry down, ladies,\" Nat said, checking the entreaty which he saw they were going to make. \"It won\u0027t be long before they answer us.\" \"Give them another round, lads!\" he said, as they reluctantly obeyed his orders. \"Get them in if you can before he is ready.\" Busy as they were, the pirates had not observed the schooner until her guns were fired. With shouts of alarm they ran back to their own ship, but these were succeeded by exclamations of anger and surprise when they saw how small was the craft that had thus intruded into the affair. By the captain\u0027s orders twenty of the crew, under his first mate, returned to the deck of the prize; a portion of the men ran to the guns, others threw off the grapnels fastening them to the prize. Before they were ready to fire, two more shots from the schooner crashed into[Pg 241] the brigantine, one passing through the bulwarks, killing three men and wounding several others with the splinters. The other struck her within a few inches of the water-line. The schooner at once bore up, discharging the guns on the starboard side as she came round, and laying her course as close to the wind as she could be jammed, showed her stern to the pirate. Two of his guns forward were fired, others could not be brought to bear. The Arrow was now almost retracing her course, for the wind was west-nor\u0027-west, and she could just follow the line of coast. \"Here they come after us!\" Turnbull said, rubbing his hands, \"as savage as bees whose hive has been disturbed.\" \"Now, Mr. Turnbull, get the two guns right aft, so as to fire over the taffrail. We must see if we cannot knock some of her spars away. As soon as you have moved the guns let all hands, except those serving them, go forward and lie down there. The weight of the guns will put her rather by the stern, and I don\u0027t want to let that fellow come any nearer to us. She is in her best trim now.\" As soon as the guns were ready they opened fire. The brigantine answered with her bow-chaser, but, as she was obliged to yaw each time she brought it to bear, she presently ceased firing. \"We are gaining on her, sir,\" Lippincott said, as he watched the pirate through his glass. \"Yes, and sailing fully a point nearer to the wind than she does. Get a stay-sail fastened to a rope, and drop it over close to the bow. I don\u0027t want to run away from her. If she found that we were too fast for her she would give up the chase, and go back to the prize. I want her to gain just enough to encourage her to keep on. She is a fast craft, but we are faster. We shall be able to manage her, providing she does not knock away any of our spars.\"[Pg 242] The start the schooner had made had at first widened the distance between them, and there was now a mile and a quarter of water separating them. The brigantine was hulled several times and her sails pierced, but her spars were still intact. She was permitted to gain until she was little more than half a mile astern, but the schooner had weathered on her, and was now nearly half a mile to windward. \"If we had an open sea on this side instead of the land,\" Turnbull said, \"and were to cut away that sail, they would not see us again.\" \"No; they must have come to the same conclusion. As it is, they no doubt think that our clawing out to windward is of no advantage to us. Now, get another gun over to the larboard side. It is lucky that there is a spare port there. We must make an effort to knock one of his spars out, or he may cripple us.\" For by this time the brigantine had again opened fire. \"Let the three best shots we have got lay the guns on her mainmast. Tell them to train them rather high, so that if they miss the mark they may cut one of the halyards, which will give us all the start we want.\" The guns were run into their position on the broadside. \"Don\u0027t hurry over it,\" Nat said; \"let each fire as his gun comes to bear.\" There was a crash and a cry as he spoke; a ball had gone through the Arrow from side to side, tearing jagged holes through her bulwarks, one of the sailors being struck to the deck by a splinter. No one spoke, every eye being fixed on the guns. These were fired almost together. There was a pause for a second or two, and then a burst of cheering as the gaff of the great mainsail of the brigantine was seen to collapse. \"It is hit close to the jaws,\" Turnbull, whose glass was levelled on the pirates, exclaimed. \"Cut away that sail in the water!\" Nat shouted. \"Up[Pg 243] with your helm, men, and bring her round. That is right,\" he went on as the schooner came up into the wind and payed off on the other tack. \"Now, slack away her sheets!\" Three guns were vengefully fired by the pirate, but the sudden change in the schooner\u0027s position disconcerted their aim, and the shot flew wide. Without waiting for orders, the seamen at two of the guns ran them over to the starboard side, and, all working at the highest pressure, poured shot after shot into the brigantine, which answered but slowly, as numbers of the men had run aloft to get the sail down to repair damages. Before she was under way again the schooner had left her a mile behind. She was now on her best point of sailing, while the brigantine was to some extent crippled by the mainsail setting badly, and by the time the headland was again passed the schooner was fully two miles ahead. Her crew had for some time been puzzled at the action being so abruptly concluded, and Turnbull had even ventured to say: \"I should think, sir, we should have a fair chance with her now.\" \"Not a very good chance. We have been lucky, but with ten guns to our four, and her strong crew of desperate men, she would be a very awkward customer. We can think of her later on. My plan is to retake the prize before she can come up. It is not likely that they have killed the crew yet, and I expect the captain told those left behind to leave things as they were until he returned. We may scarcely be a match for the brigantine, but the prize and we together should be able to give a good account of ourselves.\" \"Splendid, sir!\" Turnbull exclaimed joyously; \"that is a grand idea.\" \"Have the guns loaded with grape,\" Nat said quietly, \"and run two of them over to the other side. We will go outside the prize, bring our craft up into the wind, and shoot her up[Pg 244] inside her, and give them one broadside and then board. Tell the men to have their pistols and cutlasses ready, and distribute the boarding-pikes among the Frenchmen.\" As soon as they rounded the point they could see by their glasses that there was a sudden commotion on the deck of the merchantman. \"They did not expect to see us back first,\" Lippincott laughed. \"Even now, I should think, they are expecting to see the brigantine close behind us in chase, and don\u0027t suspect what we are up to. Don\u0027t head straight for her,\" he said to the helmsman, \"take us a couple of lengths outside her.\" The pirates, indeed, were completely deceived, but when at last they saw that the brigantine did not appear, they ran over to the guns. It was, however, too late. Two or three of these were discharged as the schooner passed, but beyond making holes in her sails no damage was done, and one of the schooner\u0027s guns poured in a volley of grape. When she was two or three lengths ahead her helm was put hard down. She flew round and just caught the wind on the other tack, gliding up alongside the merchantman, the three guns being discharged in succession as the two vessels touched. The grapnels were thrown, and the sailors and Frenchmen leapt on to her deck headed by the three officers. Nearly half the pirates had been killed or wounded by the four discharges of grape. The remainder made but a poor fight of it, and were cut down to a man. \"Off with the hatches, men!\" Nat shouted. \"Run down and release the crew.\" He himself ran aft into the saloon. Here six gentlemen and eight or ten ladies were lying bound hand and foot. Several of the men were wounded. Nat at once cut the cords. [Pg 245] \"You are safe,\" he said. \"The ship has been retaken by his majesty\u0027s schooner Arrow, but we have not done with the brigantine yet, and any of you who have weapons and can use them may lend a hand.\" Without waiting to listen to the chorus of cries of gratitude, he ran out again. A minute later a number of seamen poured up on deck. Many of them were wounded. \"How many are there of you?\" he asked an officer among them. \"There are thirty of us,\" he said; \"we had lost nearly half our crew before they boarded us. The captain was killed early in the fight, as was the first officer.\" \"Well, sir, set your men to load the guns at once. There is the brigantine just coming round the point. Monsieur Pickard, will you remain here with your party and help the sailors? Get your sails sheeted home, sir!\" he went on to the ship\u0027s officer. \"Is your vessel a fast one?\" \"Yes, but she is not so fast as that brigantine.\" \"That is of no consequence,\" Nat said. \"Get every sail you can on her. Now get twenty of our men on board again, Mr. Lippincott, and on second thoughts I will take five of the Frenchmen. Mr. Turnbull, you will remain on board in command of this ship with the other five of our men. My endeavour will be to knock away one of her masts. Do you keep as close as you can to us, and we will board her together, one on each side. If she knocks away one of our spars, I shall as far as possible come back to meet you, and if she follows us we will fight her together.\" \"I understand, sir.\" \"The moment we push off, get your head sails aback and put her on the wind so as to get out of our way. I shall fill her off on the other tack and then come round and join you. We will keep together until we see whether she means[Pg 246] to fight or run. Remember, the great thing is to knock a spar out of her.\" So saying, he leapt on to the deck of the schooner, and Turnbull\u0027s voice was at once heard shouting the order, \"Haul aft the weather sheets of the jibs;\" and in a minute the two vessels were gliding away from each other on opposite tacks. Then the Arrow was brought round and followed the Thames, which was the name of the merchantman. The brigantine was now three quarters of a mile away. Suddenly she was seen to change her course. As she wore round she presented her broadside to the two vessels, and her five guns puffed out together. The reply, both from the merchantman and the Arrow, followed almost simultaneously, and a cheer rang out from both ships as the pirate\u0027s bowsprit was seen to snap off. \"Place yourself two or three cables\u0027 length from his larboard quarter,\" Nat shouted. Turnbull, who had leapt on to the rail to see the result of the broadside, waved his hand. \"Down topsails!\" Nat shouted, \"she will be handier without them.\" In a moment the two great sails came fluttering down. Turnbull followed the example, and the men ran up the ratlines and furled some of the upper sails. Deprived of her head sails, the pirate was unmanageable, and the two vessels speedily ran up and laid themselves a couple of hundred yards from his quarters and opened a steady fire. The pirates endeavoured to drag two of their guns right aft, but the volleys of grape poured into them were too much for them, and although their captain was seen to shoot two of the men, the rest ran forward. The helmsman deserted his now useless post. \"Give her one more broadside,\" Nat shouted to Turnbull, \"and then run in and board.\" Page 246 “THE CAPTAIN OF THE PIRATES SHOOK HIS FIST IN DEFIANCE.” The captain of the pirates, mad with rage, leapt on to the[Pg 247] taffrail and shook his fist in defiance. At that moment two rifles cracked out from the merchantman, and he fell forward into the sea. The effect of the storm of grape from the three guns of the schooner, and the four from the trader, among the men huddled up in the bow of the pirate was terrible, but knowing that their lives were forfeited if they were taken prisoners, none made a movement aft to haul down the black flag that still floated from the peak. In two or three minutes their antagonists were alongside; a volley of musketry was poured in, and then the crews of both ships leapt on to the deck. The pirates, who were now reduced to about thirty men, rushed to meet them, determining to sell their lives dearly. But the odds were against them; they missed the voice of their captain to encourage them, and when twenty of their number had fallen, the remainder threw down their arms. \"Let no man stir a foot to go below,\" Nat shouted, remembering the explosion in the pirate\u0027s hold, and fearing that one of them might make straight for the magazine. He had not used his pistols in the fight, and now stood with one in each hand pointing threateningly to enforce the order. \"Mr. Lippincott, take four men below and close and securely fasten the magazine.\" The middy ran down, and returned in two or three minutes to report that he had executed the order. \"Tie those fellows\u0027 feet and hands,\" Nat said, \"and carry them down into the hold.\" When this was done he was able to look round. The deck was a perfect shambles. The brigantine, as he afterwards heard, carried originally eighty hands. Ten of these had been either killed or seriously wounded in the fight with the Thames, and twenty had been killed on board that barque when she was retaken. Forty lay dead or dying on the deck. One of the Frenchmen had fallen, six of the sailors and three Frenchmen had[Pg 248] been severely wounded, Turnbull somewhat seriously wounded, and Lippincott slightly. Monsieur Pickard, and the male passengers on board the Thames, had all joined the boarders. Two of them had previously done good service with their rifles. Had not the pirate leader been killed, the fight would have been even more desperate. One of the passengers was, fortunately, a surgeon. He at once set to work attending to the sailors\u0027 wounds, and after he had bandaged them he examined those of the pirates. These had for the most part been killed outright, and of the wounded there were but four or five with any prospect of recovery. These he first attended to, while the other passengers carried water to the dying men. \"Now, my lads,\" Nat said, \"clear the decks of the dead, and get up an awning and carry those who are alive into the shade.\" All the dead pirates were thrown over without ceremony, the body of the Frenchman being laid down by his compatriots by one of the guns for proper burial in the evening. As soon as the fight was over, Monsieur Pickard—who, after the capture of the Thames, had gone below to assure his wife and daughters that all was going on well, and that they had saved nine ladies and six gentlemen from the hands of the pirates—hurried down with the welcome news that the fight was over and the brigantine captured. \"You can go up to the cabin,\" he said, \"but don\u0027t come on deck till I come down and tell you that everything has been made clean and tidy. You will be glad to hear that, although we have several wounded, Fran?ois Amond is the only man that has been killed.\" One of the passengers of the Thames had carried similar news to the ladies there. The crews of both were at once set to work to wash decks, and in an hour the holy-stones had obliterated the worst signs of the conflict, though it would require many more scrubbings before the stains of blood en[Pg 249]tirely disappeared. All this time the vessels had remained side by side, and the ladies now ventured on to the decks of the Thames and Arrow. \"What do you intend to do, sir?\" one of the passengers asked Nat. \"I shall sail at once for Jamaica,\" he said. \"We shall want some more hands, and I must at present borrow a few from you, for my own men are not sufficiently strong to navigate my own craft and the prize. The wind is favourable, and if it holds as it is we shall be at Kingston in forty-eight hours, so there will be no great loss of time.\" He then crossed to the Arrow. \"I must congratulate you most heartily on your success,\" Madame Pickard said. \"It is wonderful indeed that you should have taken both these vessels. The pirate ship is, I should think, three times as big as you are, and the other looks a giant by her side.\" \"Yes, she is six hundred tons, and the brigantine is about three hundred. However, it has all gone very fortunately. In the first place, we have rescued some fifteen gentlemen and ladies, and twice as many seamen, from the death that they would certainly have met with; and in the next place, we have thrashed this pirate; we shall get both credit and prize-money, and a good sum for the recapture of the Thames, which the chief officer has just told me carries a very valuable cargo. Lastly, I am happy to say that, although several of the crew are injured, I have not lost a single life among them. I am sorry that one of your men fell in the fight.\" \"But they have sadly spoiled the appearance of your ship,\" Valerie Pickard said. \"There are three or four great holes along the side, and a ball has gone through your cabin, and the sails, which were so white and pretty, have lots of holes in them.\"[Pg 250] \"Yes, we shall want a good many new cloths,\" he said; \"but that is a very minor matter.\" \"Monsieur Turnbull is hurt, I hear!\" \"Yes, madame; happily it is not very serious—a blow which he only partly parried struck him on the shoulder. It looks a very serious wound, but the doctor says there is no need for any great uneasiness about him; and being seriously wounded in action has its advantages, as it always counts towards promotion. Mr. Lippincott has had one of his ears nearly slashed off, and is not pretty to look at at present, with his head done up in bandages, but the surgeon thinks that, as it was attended to so soon, it is likely that it will heal up.\" \"And you have escaped altogether, Monsieur Glover?\" Louise said. \"Yes, for once I have had good luck. Hitherto I have always come out of a fight more or less damaged; this time I have escaped without a scratch.\" \"I should feel very proud if I were you,\" the girl said, \"at having done so much with such a small ship—and you so young, too! Why, you do not look more than a year or two older than Valerie, and you have rescued us and all the people on the other ship, and taken a pirate and the vessel they had captured. It seems almost impossible. And you look so quiet and nice, too.\" \"Louise, you should not talk like that,\" her mother corrected. Nat said gravely: \"Mademoiselle, do you know that you are talking to the commander of one of his majesty\u0027s ships on his own quarter-deck, where he is, as it were, the monarch of all he surveys, and might inflict all sorts of terrible punishments upon you for your want of respect?\" The girl laughed merrily. \"I am not afraid,\" she said, \"not one little bit, and I don\u0027t[Pg 251] see why you should mind being told that you are young and quiet-looking and nice, when you are.\" \"I do not mind in the least,\" he said, \"and certainly I am young; but I can assure you that my former captain would not tell you that I was quiet, for I had the reputation of being the most troublesome middy on board his frigate. But, you see, responsibility has sobered me, and I can assure you that there is a great deal of responsibility in commanding a small craft like this, which has nothing but her speed and her luck to rely on if she happens to fall in with a strongly-armed vessel.\" \"How can you say that, monsieur,\" Valerie said indignantly, \"when you have taken this pirate, which is ever so much stronger than you are?\" \"There may be a little good management in it, but more luck, mademoiselle. If one of his shot had damaged me instead of one of mine damaging him, we should all have had our throats cut two hours ago.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she said. \"I believe that you would have beaten him anyhow.\" \"Ladies very often think what they wish,\" he said with a laugh, \"and no doubt we should have fought to the last; but I can assure you that we should have had no chance with them, and the best I could have done for you would have been to have fired the last shot of my pistol into the magazine.\" \"Please don\u0027t talk about it,\" Madame Pickard said with a shudder. \"And now I suppose that you have had fighting enough, and are going to carry us quietly into port?\" \"Yes, madame, to Jamaica; but if you would prefer to be landed at Cape Fran?ois or Port-au-Prince I shall be happy to give you a passage back again.\" \"We do not want to go there at all, but my husband will go to wind up his affairs, and sell his house there. We have been talking it over, and agree that we should never like to[Pg 252] go back to the estate again. Even if things did quiet down the memories are too terrible; and, besides, having once broken out, the blacks might do so again at any time.\" \"I think you are perfectly right, madame; but I am afraid you will not get much for your estate.\" \"My husband thinks that, although no white man would buy it, there are plenty of mulattoes who would give, not its real value, but a certain amount, for it. Many of them are rich men who have already large plantations. Ours was one of the most valuable on the island, and with the title from us a purchaser would not be afraid of being disturbed when the soldiers arrive and put down the insurrection; while, even if this should never be done, the negroes, with whom the mulattoes are now friends, would not interfere with him. My husband thinks that perhaps he will get a third of its value, which would be sufficient to keep us all comfortably in France, or wherever we may settle; but our best resource is that we have the whole of last season\u0027s produce stored in our magazines at Port-au-Prince.\" It was not until the next afternoon that the absolutely necessary repairs to the three vessels were completed, the holes near the water-line covered by planks over which pitched canvas was nailed, the ropes shot away replaced by new ones, and the brigantine\u0027s gaff repaired. Then sail was hoisted again, and the three vessels set sail for Kingston, where they arrived on the evening of the third day after starting. No little excitement was caused in the harbour when the Arrow, with her sails and sides bearing marks of the engagement, sailed in, followed by the brigantine flying the British ensign over the black flag, and the Thames with the same flags, but with the addition of the merchant ensign under the black flag, following her. There were two or three ships of war in the port, and the crews saluted the Arrow with hearty cheers.[Pg 253] The flag-ship at once ran up the signal for her commander to come on board, and, leaving Lippincott to see to the operation of anchoring, Nat ordered the gig to be lowered, and, taking his place in it, was rowed to the flag-ship. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3142/86362.html","bookId":815,"book":{"id":815,"title":"A Roving Commission","description":"简介： drop that, Curtis, you know very well that I won\u0027t have it.
