I’m so glad to be rid of him.”\\n\\n Lars stood. “I’d better get back to the restaurant. I’m already on Chef Geller’s last nerve. He told me if I mention sardines to him one more time, he’s going to hit me with a pot.” He laughed as he added, “He’ll do it, too.” He surprised Peyton by kissing her on the cheek. “I love it here.”\\n\\n “I should see if Christopher wants to go over my numbers for the week,” Mimi said.\\n\\n Peyton walked out with her. She said something funny, and Mimi was laughing as she rounded the corner and bumped into Len. He grabbed her by the shoulders to steady her, then stepped back.\\n\\n “Hello there,” he said in a rich southern drawl.\\n\\n Peyton quickly made the introductions. With his most charming smile, he said, “How do you do?”\\n\\n One hand on her hip, Mimi looked up at him and responded, “I do just fine.”\\n\\n Len blocked the doorway as he stood there grinning at Mimi. She kept waiting for him to get out of her way, but he didn’t seem inclined to move, so she edged around him. As Len turned to watch her walk away, Peyton tapped his arm to get his attention.\\n\\n “I’m happy to see you,” she began. “We didn’t expect you for another two weeks.”\\n\\n “My schedule changed.” He straightened and said, “And I talked to Christopher about Debi. Come on, Peyton. Let’s go chat with Lucy.”\\n\\n As he crossed the office, he whispered, “Is Mimi married?”\\n\\n “No, she’s available,” Peyton told him.\\n\\n “She’s a little spitfire.”\\n\\n She agreed. “Yes, she is.”\\n\\n He let Peyton go in the conference room, then he pulled the door closed behind him. Lucy pushed aside some catalogs so they could sit.\\n\\n “Now then, about Debi,” he began.\\n\\n Lucy and Peyton shared a look. Another chance? Peyton wondered. Was Len going to ask them to take her back again? She honestly didn’t think she had the stamina to go another round.\\n\\n “I spoke with Christopher and I had a long, long talk with Scott Cassady. He admitted he’d made a deal with Debi to pay her a percent if she helped him get Bishop’s Cove. But he insisted she came to him with the idea. He also insisted he wasn’t aware of any vandalism. I’m not going to pursue legal action, but he’s on notice, and I don’t think you’ll be having any more trouble from him.”\\n\\n “What are you going to do about Debi?” Lucy asked. “If you want her to come back here, I guess we could . . .” She stopped talking when she saw the daggers in Peyton’s eyes.\\n\\n “No, I talked to her father. Brian has used every excuse in the book for his daughter’s behavior.” He smiled then. “I told him he should let Debi move back home. I said that Bishop’s Cove wasn’t a good fit for her, and she should stay with him until I find the right project.” After a slightly wicked chuckle, he said, “There isn’t going to be another project. I just wanted to get my brother off my back. Wonder how he’ll do with Debi living with him.”\\n\\n “Did you tell him about the damage she’s done here?” Lucy asked.\\n\\n “No, and I’m not going to. I don’t want you girls mentioning it, either.”\\n\\n No more Debi. Peyton was giddy with joy.\\n\\n “I have one more announcement,” he said. “It’s about the deal I made with you for this resort. I’ve changed my mind.”\\n\\n Peyton’s heart sank. She looked at Lucy and could tell she was feeling the same. They’d been at the resort only three months, but it was obvious they weren’t going to be able to make a twenty percent profit within the year. There had been too many setbacks that delayed the opening. They might as well face the facts and admit their failure.\\n\\n Len continued. “I’ve decided the resort is yours.”\\n\\n “I’m really sorry, Uncle Len,” Peyton said. “I know you . . . Wait. What did you say?”\\n\\n “I said the resort is yours at the end of the year, and you don’t have to show the twenty percent profit. There have been too many things that have been out of your control. Plus, I’d really like to add the swimming center, and that will take some time. I’ve looked around at what you’ve accomplished so far, and I have to say, despite all the obstacles, you’ve done an amazing job. I think I’ll be leaving Bishop’s Cove in very capable hands.” He looked at Lucy when he added, “Especially if Christopher is around to help you manage things.” Clasping his hands together to finalize his offer, he said, “So, what do you say? Are you up for it?”\\n\\n Peyton and Lucy answered at the same time with an enthusiastic “Yes!”\\n\\n Peyton waited until evening to tell Finn the news. He was getting ready to leave and would be back next weekend so they could go shopping for an engagement ring.\\n\\n They called his parents to make their announcement, and then they phoned her parents and spoke to Peyton’s father. He was thrilled.\\n\\n “I’ll let Peyton tell her mother,” he said and shouted to his wife.\\n\\n She came on the line a minute later. Her greeting was predictable. “Have you met anyone?”\\n\\n Wow, Peyton thought. Once she was married, she’d never have to hear that question again. “I’m getting married—”\\n\\n “Stop teasing me.”\\n\\n “Mom, it’s true. Finn MacBain asked me to marry him, and I said yes.”\\n\\n “Finn? Our Finn?”\\n\\n “Yes, our Finn.”\\n\\n “And you’re getting married?”\\n\\n Peyton put her hand over the phone. “I think she’s in shock.”\\n\\n Her mother sounded as though the weight of the world had just been lifted from her shoulders. “Oh, thank God. Finally.”\\n\\n “Mom . . .”\\n\\n “It finally happened.” There was that word again.\\n\\n “Mother . . .”\\n\\n “I’m just beside myself with happiness. We have to plan a wedding.”\\n\\n “If Finn agrees, I’d like to be married here in Bishop’s Cove.”\\n\\n “Finally. I just can’t believe it.”\\n\\n “Mom, do you talk this way to Lucy and Ivy?”\\n\\n “I’m just reeling.”\\n\\n “I’ll talk to you soon. Love you.”\\n\\n She disconnected the call, turned to Finn, and said, “She’s happy.”\\n\\n And that was the understatement of the year.\\n\\n Peyton sat on the bed, watching Finn pack. “What do you think about a small wedding in a church in Port James and the reception here at the Cove? We could be married next year.”\\n\\n He shook his head, dropped the shirt he was folding, and sat down next to her. “I’m not waiting a year. Yeah, we can get married here, but not next year. How about next month?”\\n\\n She scooted onto his lap and put her arms around him. “Six months.”\\n\\n “No, next month.”\\n\\n “This summer then.” She kissed the side of his neck to distract him.\\n\\n He finally agreed. It would be a summer wedding.\\n\\n “Remember how you were so opposed to marriage?”\\n\\n He hugged her and said, “Yeah, I remember. But marriage to you . . . I can’t wait to make it legal. You’re going to be mine then.”\\n\\n Going to be? Didn’t he know? She had always been his.\\n\\n EPILOGUE\\n\\n ONE YEAR LATER\\n\\n The grand opening of the Bishop’s Cove Aquatic Center turned into one hell of a party. The hotel and every bungalow were filled to capacity with family and friends who had booked months before. Olympic hopefuls were also there, as well as several top coaches. They all knew who Finn was.\\n\\n By a unanimous vote it was decided that Uncle Len would officially open the center. The chrome-and-white dome hid the beautiful pool. A huge crowd gathered to watch as Len walked forward. Most of the men and women were in swimming attire and were anxiously waiting to jump into the cool water. Len wasn’t much on speeches. After welcoming everyone, he pushed a button and the dome came to life. The sides spread wide, then disappeared into thin trenches that closed seamlessly.\\n\\n There was a good deal of cheering and laughing. Finn stood watching the festivities.\\n\\n The terrace adjacent to the pool was adorned with colorful bouquets on tall pedestals, and two lavish buffet tables sat on opposite ends. Beyond, scattered on the manicured lawn that the gardeners had nurtured, round tables with chairs, all covered in white linen, waited for the guests to sit. Most of them were in the pool now.\\n\\n The newlyweds, Christopher and Lucy, couldn’t seem to let go of each other. Finn understood. He and Peyton had been married nine months, and he still wanted to throw his arms around her whenever she was near.\\n\\n At the buffet table Lars inspected his delectable creations—all with an aquatic theme—and beamed with pride.\\n\\n Peyton was on the other side of the pool talking to a couple of Beck’s Navy SEAL friends.\\n\\n Finn’s brothers, Tristan and Beck, saw him frowning and came to stand beside him. “What’s the problem?” Beck asked in a low voice.\\n\\n Finn nodded toward Peyton and then toward the two men a few feet away from her. “Those guys are ogling my wife.”\\n\\n “Hey, you’ve got a hot wife. You gotta expect guys will notice,” Beck said.\\n\\n “Yeah? They ought to notice she’s wearing a wedding ring and leave her the hell alone.”\\n\\n Tristan laughed. “I don’t think you have to worry. Peyton’s pretty stuck on you, though God only knows why.” He scanned the crowd. “Has anyone seen my wife?”\\n\\n “Over by the fountain,” Beck said right before he spotted Ivy and took off.\\n\\n Finn heard a burst of laughter behind him and turned. Len and Mimi were also having fun. Mimi had just said something funny, and Len looked like a besotted schoolboy.\\n\\n Was it something in the water down here? Finn wondered. He could see the advertisement now: Come to Bishop’s Cove and fall in love. He sure as certain had. No, that wasn’t exactly true. It was when he was standing in front of the church at Tristan’s wedding. She’d walked up to him and looked into his eyes, and he was a goner.\\n\\n Peyton walked around the pool to join him. She put her arms around his neck and kissed him. “Those Navy SEALs are wild,” she remarked.\\n\\n “They know how to have fun.”\\n\\n A young man named Elliott came toward him, and one of the coaches Finn had met earlier was with him. Then Beck and two SEALs joined the group. Something was going on because Beck had that devil grin on his face.\\n\\n “How about racing with us?” Beck asked. “Just two laps.”\\n\\n “Who’s us?”\\n\\n “Some of the team is here,” Elliott said. “We go to nationals soon.”\\n\\n Finn shook his head. “I don’t think so.”\\n\\n Elliott glanced at Beck, who nodded. Then he turned back to Finn. “Don’t you have what it takes now that you’re an old man?”\\n\\n “Are you going to let him call you old?” Beck wanted to know.\\n\\n “You probably haven’t been in a pool since you won those medals, have you?” Elliott asked.\\n\\n Finn looked at Peyton. She smiled and shrugged.\\n\\n “Okay,” he said. “Two laps.”\\n\\n When the swimmers saw the men lining up, they all rushed to get out of the pool and watch the race.\\n\\n Tristan was designated the starter. He yelled, “Go!” and the men soared out like arrows and sliced into the water. People began to cheer their favorites.\\n\\n Peyton saw Finn’s dive but could barely make him out as the men splashed their way across the pool. The crowd closed in on her and she had to step around a couple standing in front of her in time to see the swimmers making their flip turns. Suddenly a huge roar erupted from the people watching. She turned and saw Finn gliding home to the finish, his competition still halfway across the pool. Barely winded, he raised up out of the water, looked for Peyton in the crowd, and smiled.\\n\\n She laughed and thought, Still a hotshot. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hotshot-buchanan-renard-11/page-41.html","bookId":1826,"book":{"id":1826,"title":"Hotshot (Buchanan-Renard #11)","description":"Storyline: #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood returns with a novel of family drama, suspense, and—of course—romance. \\n Peyton Lockhart and her sisters have inherited Bishop’s Cove, a small, luxurious oceanfront resort, but it comes with a condition: The girls must run the resort for one year and show a profit—only then will they own it. \\n A graduate of a prestigious French culinary school, Peyton has just lost her job as a food critic.
