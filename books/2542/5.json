In the lead car was Deutsch\u0027s representative. Dr. Barrett, Edith, Florence Tanner, and Fischer rode in the second, chauffeur-driven limousine, Fischer sitting on the pull-down seat, facing the other three. Florence put her hand on Edith\u0027s. \"I hope you didn\u0027t think me unfriendly before,\" she said. \"It was only that I felt concern for you, going into that house.\" \"I understand,\" said Edith. She drew her hand away. \"I\u0027d appreciate it, Miss Tanner,\" Barrett told her, \"if you wouldn\u0027t alarm my wife prematurely.\" \"I had no intention of doing that, Doctor. Still - \" Florence hesitated, then went on. \"You have prepared Mrs. Barrett, I trust.\" \"My wife has been advised that there will be occurrences.\" Fischer grunted. \"One way of putting it,\" he said. It was the first time he\u0027d spoken in an hour. Barrett turned to him. \"She has also been advised,\" he said, \"that these occurrences will not, in any way, signify the presence of the dead.\" Fischer nodded, taking out a pack of cigarettes. \"All right if I smoke?\" he asked. His gaze flicked across their faces. Seeing no objection, he lit one. Florence was about to say something more to Barrett, then changed her mind. \"Odd that a project such as this should be financed by a man like Deutsch,\" she said. \"I would never have thought him genuinely interested in these matters.\" \"He\u0027s an old man,\" Barrett said. \"He\u0027s thinking about dying, and wants to believe it isn\u0027t the end.\" \"It isn\u0027t, of course.\" Barrett smiled. \"You look familiar,\" Edith said to Florence. \"Why is that?\" \"I used to be an actress years ago. Television mostly, an occasional film. My acting name was Florence Michaels.\" Edith nodded. Florence looked at Barrett, then at Fischer. \"Well, this is exciting,\" she said. \"To work with two such giants. How can that house not fall before us?\" \"Why is it called Hell House?\" Edith asked. \"Because its owner, Emeric Belasco, created a private hell there,\" Barrett told her. \"Is he supposed to be the one who haunts the house?\" \"Among many,\" Florence said. \"The phenomena are too complex to be the work of one surviving spirit. It\u0027s obviously a case of multiple haunting.\" \"Let\u0027s just say there\u0027s something there,\" said Barrett. Florence smiled. \"Agreed.\" \"Will you get rid of it with your machine?\" asked Edith. Florence and Fischer looked at Barrett. \"I\u0027ll explain it presently,\" he said. They all looked toward the windows as the car angled downward. \"We\u0027re almost there,\" Barrett said. He looked at Edith. \"The house is in the Matawaskie Valley.\" All of them gazed at the hill-ringed valley lying ahead, its floor obscured by fog. Fischer stubbed his cigarette in the ashtray, blowing out smoke. Looking forward again, he winced. \"We\u0027re going in.\" The car was suddenly immersed in greenish mist. Its speed was decreased by the driver, and they saw him leaning forward, peering through the windshield. After several moments he switched on the fog lights and wipers. \"How could anyone want to build a house in such a place?\" asked Florence. \"This was sunshine to Belasco,\" Fischer said. They all stared through the windows at the curling fog. It was as though they rode inside a submarine, slowly navigating downward through a sea of curdled milk. At various moments, trees or bushes or boulder formations would appear beside the car, then disappear. The only sound was the hum of the engine. At last the car was braked. They all looked forward to see the other Cadillac in front of them. There was a faint sound as its door was closed. Then the figure of Deutsch\u0027s representative loomed from the mist. Barrett depressed a button, and the window by his side slid down. He grimaced at the fetid odor of the mist. The man leaned over. \"We\u0027re at the turnoff,\" he said. \"Your chauffeur is going into Caribou Falls with us, so one of you will have to drive to the house - it\u0027s just a little way. The telephone has been connected, the electricity is on, and your rooms are ready.\" He glanced at the floor. \"The food in that basket should see you through the afternoon. Supper will be delivered at six. Any questions?\" \"Will we need a key for the front door?\" Barrett asked. \"No, it\u0027s unlocked.\" \"Get one anyway,\" Fischer said. Barrett looked at him, then back at the man. \"Perhaps we\u0027d better.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-5.html","bookId":2542,"book":{"id":2542,"title":"Hell House","description":"Storyline: Can any soul survive?
