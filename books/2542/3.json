All I\u0027ll have to do is work.\" \"I\u0027ve always helped you, though,\" she said. \"I know. It\u0027s just that - \" \"What?\" He hesitated. \"I\u0027d rather you weren\u0027t along this time, that\u0027s all.\" \" Why, Lionel?\" She looked uneasy when he didn\u0027t answer. \"Is it me?\" \"Of course not.\" Barrett\u0027s smile was quick, distracted. \"It\u0027s the house.\" \"Isn\u0027t it just another so-called haunted house?\" she asked, using his phrase. \"I\u0027m afraid it isn\u0027t,\" he admitted. \"It\u0027s the Mount Everest of haunted houses, you might say. There were two attempts to investigate it, one in 1931, the other in 1940. Both were disasters. Eight people involved in those attempts were killed, committed suicide, or went insane. Only one survived, and I have no idea how sound he is - Benjamin Fischer, one of the two who\u0027ll be with me. \"It\u0027s not that I fear the ultimate effect of the house,\" he continued, trying to ameliorate his words. \"I have confidence in what I know. It\u0027s simply that the details of the investigation may be\" - he shrugged - \"a little nasty.\" \"And yet you want me to let you go there alone?\" \"My dear - \" \"What if something happens to you?\" \"Nothing will.\" \"What if it does? With me in New York, and you in Maine?\" \"Edith, nothing\u0027s going to happen.\" \"Then there\u0027s no reason I can\u0027t go.\" She tried to smile. \"I\u0027m not afraid, Lionel.\" \"I know you\u0027re not.\" \"I won\u0027t get in your way.\" Barrett sighed. \"I know I don\u0027t understand much of what you\u0027re doing, but there are always things I can do to help. Pack and unload your equipment, for instance. Help you set up your experiments. Type the rest of your manuscript; you said you wanted to have it ready by the first of the year. And I want to be with you when you prove your theory.\" Barrett nodded. \"Let me think about it.\" \"I won\u0027t be in your way,\" she promised. \"And I know there are any number of things I can do to help.\" He nodded again, trying to think. It was obvious she didn\u0027t want to stay behind. He could appreciate that. Except for his three weeks in London in 1962, they\u0027d never been separated since their marriage. Would it really hurt that much to take her? Certainly, she\u0027d experienced enough psychic phenomena by now to be accustomed to it. Still, that house was such an unknown factor. It hadn\u0027t been called Hell House without reason. There was a power there strong enough to physically and/or mentally demolish eight people, three of whom had been scientists like himself. Even believing that he knew exactly what that power was, dare he expose Edith to it? DECEMBER 20, 1970 10:39 P.M. Florence Tanner crossed the yard which separated her small house from the church and walked along the alley to the street. She stood on the sidewalk and gazed at her church. It was only a converted store, but it had been everything to her these past six years. She looked at the sign in the painted window: TEMPLE OF SPIRITUAL HARMONY. She smiled. It was indeed. Those six years had been the most spiritually harmonious of her life. She walked to the door, unlocked it, and went inside. The warmth felt good. Shivering, she turned on the wall lamp in the vestibule. Her eye was caught by the bulletin board: Sunday Services - 11:00 am., 8:00 p.m. Healing and Prophecy - Tuesdays, 7:45 p.m. Lectures and Spirit Greetings - Wednesdays, 7:45 p.m. Messages and Revelations - Thursdays, 7:45 p.m. Holy Communion - 1st Sunday of Month","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-3.html","bookId":2542,"book":{"id":2542,"title":"Hell House","description":"Storyline: Can any soul survive?
