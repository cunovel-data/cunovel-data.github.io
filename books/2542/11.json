For the past ten minutes, she\u0027d been sitting in a corner, \"preparing herself,\"\\n\\n she\u0027d told them. Now she was ready. \"As ready as one can be in this kind of climate. Excessive dampness is always a handicap.\" She smiled. \"Shall we take our places?\"\\n\\n The four sat at the huge round table, Fischer across from Florence, Barrett several chairs away from her, Edith next to him.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s occurred to me,\" Florence said as she settled herself, \"that the evil in this house is so intensely concentrated that it might be a constant lure to earthbound spirits everywhere. In other words, the house might be acting like a giant magnet for degraded souls. This could explain its complicated texture.\"\\n\\n What is one supposed to say to that? Barrett thought. He glanced at Edith, forced to repress a smile at her expression as she gazed at Florence. \"You\u0027re certain this equipment isn\u0027t going to bother you?\" he said.\\n\\n \"Not at all. As a matter of fact, it might not be amiss for you to switch on your tape recorder when Red Cloud starts to speak.\\n\\n He might say something valuable.\"\\n\\n Barrett nodded noncommittally.\\n\\n \"It works on battery as well, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Barrett nodded again.\\n\\n \"Good.\" Florence smiled. \"The rest of the instruments, of course, are of no use to me.\" She looked at Edith. \"Your husband has explained to you, I\u0027m sure, that I\u0027m not a physical medium. Mine is solely a mental contact with those in spirit. I admit them only in the form of thought.\" She glanced around. \"Will you put out your candles now?\"\\n\\n Edith tensed as Lionel wet two fingers and crimped out the wick of his candle, Fischer blew his out. Only hers remained, a tiny, pulsing aura of light in the vastness of the hall; the fire had gone out an hour earlier. Edith was unable to make herself extinguish it. Barrett reached out and did it for her.\\n\\n Blackness seemed to crash across her like a tidal wave, taking her breath. She groped for Lionel\u0027s hand, the moment reminding her of a visit she had made once to the Carlsbad Caverns. In one of the caverns, the guide had turned out the lights, and the darkness had been so intense that she had felt it pressing at her eyes.\\n\\n \"O Spirit of Love and Tenderness,\" Florence began. \"We gather here tonight to discover a more perfect understanding of the laws which govern our being.\"\\n\\n Barrett felt how cold Edith\u0027s hand was and smiled in sympathy. He knew what she was going through; he\u0027d been through the same thing dozens of times in the early days of his work. True, she\u0027d been to seances with him before, but never in a place with such an awesome size and history.\\n\\n \"Give us, O Divine Teacher, avenues of communication with those beyond, particularly those who walk this house in restless torment.\"\\n\\n Fischer pulled in a long, erratic breath. He recalled his first sitting here in 1940 - in this hall, at this very table. Objects had been hurled about; Dr. Graham had been knocked unconscious by one of them. A greenish, glowing mist had filled the air.\\n\\n Fischer\u0027s throat felt parched. I shouldn\u0027t be sitting in on this, he thought.\\n\\n \"May the work of bridging the chasm of death be, by us, so faithfully accomplished that pain may be transformed into joy, sorrow into peace. All this we ask in the name of our infinite Father. Amen.\"\\n\\n It was silent for a while. Then Edith\u0027s legs retracted as Florence began to sing in a soft, melodious voice: \"\u0027The world hath felt a quickening breath from heaven\u0027s eternal shore. And souls, triumphant over death, return to earth once more.\u0027\" Something about the sound of her muted singing in the darkness made Edith\u0027s flesh crawl.\\n\\n When the hymn had ended. Florence started to breathe in deeply, making passes in front of her face. After several minutes, she began to rub both hands over her arms and shoulders, down across her breasts, and over her stomach and thighs. The strokings were almost sensual as she massaged herself, lips parted, eyes half-closed, an expression of torpid abandonment on her face. Her breathing became slower and louder. Soon it was a hoarsely sibilant, wheezing sound. By then, her hands lay flaccid in her lap, her arms and legs twitching slightly. Bit by bit, her head leaned back until it touched the chair. She drew in an extended, quavering breath, then was still.\\n\\n The great hall was without a sound. Barrett stared at the place where Florence sat, though nothing was visible to him. Edith had closed her eyes, preferring an individual darkness to that of the room. Fischer sat tensely in his chair, waiting.\\n\\n Florence\u0027s chair made a creaking noise. \"Me Red Cloud,\" she said in a sonorous voice. Her face, in the darkness, was stonelike, her expression imperious. \"Me Red Cloud,\" she repeated.\\n\\n Barrett sighed. \"Good evening.\"\\n\\n Florence grunted, nodding. \"Me come from afar. Bring greeting to you from realm of Eternal Peace. Red Cloud happy see you. Always happy see earthlings gather in circle of belief. We with you always, watch and ward. Death not end of road. Death but door to world without end. This we know.\"\\n\\n \"Could you - ?\" Barrett started.\\n\\n \"Earthling souls in prison,\" Florence interrupted. \"Bound in dungeons of flesh.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Barrett. \"Could you - ?\"\\n\\n \"Death the pardon, the release. Leave behind what poet call \u0027muddy vesture of decay.\u0027 Find freedom - light - eternal joy.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but do you think - ?\"\\n\\n Edith bit her lower lip to keep from laughing as Florence interrupted again. \"Tanner woman say put on machine, get voice on ribbon. Not know what she mean. You do that?\"\\n\\n Barrett grunted. \"Very well.\" Reaching across the table, he felt around for the tape recorder, switched it on, and pushed the microphone toward Florence. \"Now, if you\u0027d - \"\\n\\n \"Red Cloud Tanner woman guide. Guide second medium on this side. Talk with Tanner woman. Bring other spirits to her.\"\\n\\n Florence looked around abruptly, teeth bared, eyebrows pressing down, a growl of disapproval rumbling in her throat \"Bad house. Place of sickness. Evil here. Bad medicine.\" She shook her head and growled again. \" Bad medicine.\"\\n\\n She twisted around the other way, grunting in surprise, as though someone had come up behind her and attracted her attention. \"Man here. Ugly man. Like caveman. Long hair. Dirt on face. Scratches, sores. Yellow teeth. Man bent over, twisted.\\n\\n No clothes. Like animal. Breathing hard. In pain. Very sick. Say: \u0027Give me peace. Let free.\u0027\"\\n\\n Edith clutched at Lionel\u0027s hand, afraid to open her eyes lest she see the figure Florence had described.\\n\\n Florence shook her head, then slowly raised her arm and pointed toward the entry hall. \"Go. Leave house.\" She stared into the darkness, turned back with a grunt. \"No good. Here too long. Not listen. Not understand.\" She tapped her head with an index finger. \"Too much sick inside.\"\\n\\n She made a sound as though something interesting had been imparted to her. \"Limits,\" she said. \"Nations. Terms. Not know what that mean. Extremes and limits. Terminations and extremities.\" She shook her head. \"Not know.\"\\n\\n She jerked around as though someone had grabbed her rudely by the shoulder. \"No. Go away.\" She grunted. \"Young man here. Say must talk - must talk.\" She made a grumbling noise and then was still.\\n\\n All three twitched as Florence cried out, \"I don\u0027t know you people!\" She looked around the table, her expression one of rabid agitation. \"Why are you here? It does no good. Nothing ever changes. Nothing! Get out of here, or I\u0027ll hurt you! I can\u0027t help myself! God damn you filthy sons of bitches!\"\\n\\n Edith pressed back hard against her chair. The voice was totally unlike Florence\u0027s - hysterical, unbalanced, threatening.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you see I\u0027m helpless! I don\u0027t want to hurt you, but I must! \" Florence\u0027s head shifted forward, eyes hooding, lips drawn back from clenching teeth. \"I warn you,\" she told them in a guttural voice. \" Get out of this house before I kill you all.\"\\n\\n Edith cried out as a series of loud, staccato rappings sounded on the table. \"What\u0027s that?\" she asked. Her voice was lost beneath the chain of savage blows. It sounded as though a berserk man were pounding a hammer on the tabletop as hard and fast as he could. Barrett started to reach for his instruments, then remembered that there was no electricity. Damn! he thought.\\n\\n Abruptly, the rappings ceased. Edith looked toward Florence as the medium started making groaning noises. She could still hear the blows ringing in her ears. Her body felt numb, as though the vibrations had deadened her flesh.\\n\\n She started as Lionel pulled his hand free. She heard a rustling of his clothes, then started again as a small red light appeared where he was sitting. He had taken the pencil flashlight from his pocket and was pointing it at Florence. In the dim illumination, Edith could see the medium\u0027s head lolling back against the chair, eyes shut, mouth hanging open.\\n\\n She stiffened, suddenly aware of a mounting coldness underneath the table. Shuddering, she crossed her arms. Fischer clenched his teeth together, willing himself not to jump from his chair.\\n\\n Barrett tugged at the microphone wire, the scraping of the microphone across the table making Edith shudder. Picking it up, he noted quickly, \"Temperature decline. Strictly tactile. Instrument reading impossible. Physical phenomena commenced with series of severe percussions.\" He pointed the flashlight at Florence again. \"Miss Tanner reacting erratically. Trance state retained, but variable. Possible confusion at onset of unexpected physical phenomena. Absence of cabinet a probable factor.\\n\\n Handing subject tube of uranium-salt solution.\"\\n\\n Edith watched the red light flicking around the tabletop. She saw Lionel\u0027s dark hand pick up the tube. The coldness beneath the table was making her legs and ankles ache. Still, she felt a little better, the unruffled tone of Lionel\u0027s voice having had a quieting effect on het. She watched as he pressed the tube into Florence\u0027s hands.\\n\\n Florence sat up quickly, opening her eyes.\\n\\n Barrett frowned in disappointment. \"Subject out of trance.\" He switched off the tape recorder and struck a match. Florence averted her face while he relit the candles.\\n\\n Fischer stood and moved around the table to a pitcher of water. As he poured some into a glass, the lip of the pitcher rattled on the glass edge. Barrett glanced at him. Fischer handed the glass to Florence, who drank its contents in a single swallow.\\n\\n \"There.\" She smiled at Fischer. \"Thank you.\" She set the glass down, shivering. \"What happened?\"\\n\\n When Barrett told her, she stared at him in confusion. \"I don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m not a physical medium.\"\\n\\n \"You were just now. The embryo of one, at any rate.\"\\n\\n Florence looked disturbed. \"That doesn\u0027t make sense. Why should I suddenly become a physical medium after all these years?\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea.\"\\n\\n Florence gazed at him. Finally she nodded with reluctance. \"Yes; this house.\" She looked around. At last she sighed. \"God\u0027s will, not mine,\" she said. \"If my part in the cleansing is to alter my mediumship, so be it. All that matters is the end.\" She didn\u0027t look at Fischer as she spoke. The weight\u0027s been lifted from his shoulders to be put on mine, she thought.\\n\\n \"We can work together now if you\u0027re amenable,\" said Barrett.\\n\\n \"Yes, of course.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll telephone Deutsch\u0027s man and have him see to the construction of a cabinet tomorrow morning.\" Barrett wasn\u0027t convinced that what had happened indicated a physical mediumship in Florence extensive enough for his needs. There was certainly no immediate harm in seeing if she had the capability, however. If she did it would be more expeditious to work with her than be forced to wait for Deutsch\u0027s permission to bring up one of his own people.\\n\\n Seeing her expression still reflect uneasy doubt, he asked, \"You really want this?\"\\n\\n \" Yes, yes.\" Her smile was disconcerted. \"It\u0027s just that . . . well, it\u0027s difficult for me to understand. All these years, a mental medium.\" She shook her head. \"Now this.\" She made a sound of wry amusement. \"The Lord moves in mysterious ways indeed.\"\\n\\n \"So does this house,\" said Fischer.\\n\\n Florence looked at him in surprise. \"You think the house had something to do with me - ?\"\\n\\n \"Just watch your step,\" he cut her off. \"The Lord may not have too much influence in Hell House.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-11.html","bookId":2542,"book":{"id":2542,"title":"Hell House","description":"Storyline: Can any soul survive? \\n Regarded as the Mount Everest of haunted houses, Belasco House has witnessed scenes of almost unimaginable horror and depravity.
