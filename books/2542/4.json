For several moments she was pleased to be reminded of her beauty. Forty-three, she still retained it unimpaired, her long red hair untouched by grayness, her tall, Junoesque figure almost as trim as it had been in her twenties. She smiled in self-depreciation then. Vanity of vanities, she thought. She went into the church, walked along the carpeted aisle, and stepped onto the platform, taking a familiar pose behind the lectern. She looked at the rows of chairs, the hymnals set on every third one. She visualized her congregation sitting before her. \"My dears,\" she murmured. She had told them at the morning and evening services. Told them of the need for her to be away from them for the next week. Told them of the answer to their prayers - the means to build a true church on their own property. Asked them to pray for her while she was gone. Florence clasped her hands on the lectern and closed her eyes. Her lips moved slightly as she prayed for the strength to cleanse the Belasco house. It had such a dreadful history of death and suicide and madness. It was a house most horribly defiled. She prayed to end its curse. The prayer completed, Florence lifted her head and gazed at her church. She loved it deeply. Still, to be able to build a real church for her congregation was truly a gift from heaven. And at Christmastime . . . She smiled, eyes glistening with tears. God was good. 11:17 P.M. Edith finished brushing her teeth and gazed at her reflection in the mirror - at her short-cut auburn hair, her strong, almost masculine features. Her expression was a worried one. Disturbed by the sight of it, she switched off the bathroom light and returned to the bedroom. Lionel was asleep. She sat on her bed and looked at him, listening to the sound of his heavy breathing. Poor dear, she thought. There had been so much to do. By ten o\u0027clock he\u0027d been exhausted, and she\u0027d made him go to bed. Edith lay on her side and continued looking at him. She\u0027d never seen him so concerned before. He\u0027d made her promise that she\u0027d never leave his side once they\u0027d entered the Belasco house. Could it be that bad? She\u0027d been to haunted houses with Lionel and never been frightened. He was always so calm, so confident; it was impossible to be afraid when he was near. Yet, he was disturbed enough about the Belasco house to make an issue of her staying by his side at all times. Edith shivered. Would her presence harm him? Would looking after her use up so much of his limited energy that his work would suffer? She didn\u0027t want that. She knew how much his work meant to him. Still, she had to go. She\u0027d face anything rather than be alone. She\u0027d never told Lionel how close she\u0027d come to a mental breakdown during those three weeks he\u0027d been gone in 1962. It would only have distressed him, and he\u0027d needed all his concentration for the work he was doing. So she\u0027d lied and sounded cheerful on the telephone the three times he\u0027d called - and, alone, she\u0027d wept and shaken, taken tranquilizers, hadn\u0027t slept or eaten, lost thirteen pounds, fought off compulsions to end it all. Met him at the airport finally, pale and smiling, told him that she\u0027d had the flu. Edith closed her eyes and drew her legs up. She couldn\u0027t face that again. The worst haunted house in the world threatened her less than being alone. 11:41 P.M. He couldn\u0027t sleep. Fischer opened his eyes and looked around the cabin of Deutsch\u0027s private plane. Strange to be sitting in an armchair in an airplane, he thought. Strange to be sitting in an airplane at all. He\u0027d never flown in his life. Fischer reached for the coffeepot and poured himself another cupful. He rubbed a hand across his eyes and picked up one of the magazines lying on the coffee table in front of him. It was one of Deutsch\u0027s. What else? he thought. After a while his eyes went out of focus, and the words on the page began to blur together. Going back, he thought. The only one of nine people still walking around, and he was going back for more. They\u0027d found him lying on the front porch of the house that morning in September 1940, naked, curled up like a fetus, shivering and staring into space. When they\u0027d put him on a stretcher, he\u0027d begun to scream and vomit blood, his muscles knotting, rocldike. He\u0027d lain in a coma three months in the Caribou Falls Hospital. When he\u0027d opened his eyes, he\u0027d looked like a haggard man of thirty, a month short of his sixteenth birthday. Now he was forty-five, a lean, gray-haired man with dark eyes, his expression one of hard, suspicious readiness. Fischer straightened in the chair. Never mind; it\u0027s time, he thought. He wasn\u0027t fifteen anymore, wasn\u0027t naive or gullible, wasn\u0027t the credulous prey he\u0027d been in 1940. Things would be different this time. He\u0027d never dreamed in his wildest fancies that he\u0027d be given a second chance at the house. After his mother had died, he\u0027d traveled to the West Coast. Probably, he later realized, to get as far away as possible from Maine. He\u0027d committed clumsy fraud in Los Angeles and San Francisco, deliberately alienating Spiritualists and scientists alike in order to be free of them. He\u0027d existed barely for thirty years, washing dishes, doing farmwork, selling door to door, janitoring, anything to earn money without using his mind. Yet, somehow, he\u0027d protected his ability and nurtured it. It was still there, maybe not as spectacular as it had been when he was fifteen, but very much intact - and backed now by the thoughtful caution of a man rather than the suicidal arrogance of a teenager. He was ready to shake loose the dormant psychic muscles, exercise and strengthen them, use them once more. Against that pesthole up in Maine. Against Hell House.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-4.html","bookId":2542,"book":{"id":2542,"title":"Hell House","description":"Storyline: Can any soul survive?
