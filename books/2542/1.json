He repressed a smile. He felt rather like a character in some latter-day Gothic romance. The driving rain, the cold, the two-hour ride from Manhattan in one of Deutsch\u0027s long black leatherupholstered limousines. The interminable wait in this corridor while disconcerted-looking men and women hurried in and out of Deutsch\u0027s bedroom, glancing at him occasionally.\n He drew his watch from its vest pocket and raised the lid. He\u0027d been here more than an hour now. What did Deutsch want of him? Something to do with parapsychology, most likely. The old man\u0027s chain of newspapers and magazines were forever printing articles on the subject. \"Return from the Grave\"; \"The Girl Who Wouldn\u0027t Die\" - always sensational, rarely factual.\n Wincing at the effort, Dr. Barrett lifted his right leg over his left. He was a tall, slightly overweight man in his middle fifties, his thinning blond hair unchanged in color, though his trimmed beard showed traces of white. He sat erect on the straight-back chair, staring at the door to Deutsch\u0027s bedroom. Edith must be getting restless downstairs. He was sorry she\u0027d come. Still, he\u0027d had no way of knowing it would take this long.\n The door to Deutsch\u0027s bedroom opened, and his male secretary, Hanley, came out. \"Doctor,\" he said.\n Barrett reached for his cane and, standing, limped across the hallway, stopping in front of the shorter man. He waited while the secretary leaned in through the doorway and announced, \"Doctor Barrett, sir.\" Then he stepped past Hanley, entering the room. The secretary closed the door behind him.\n The darkly paneled bedroom was immense. Sanctum of the monarch, Barrett thought as he moved across the rug. Stopping by the massive bed, he looked at the old man sitting in it. Rolf Rudolph Deutsch was eighty-seven, bald, and skeletal, his dark eyes peering out from bony cavities. Barrett smiled. \"Good afternoon.\" Intriguing that this wasted creature ruled an empire, he was thinking.\n \"You\u0027re crippled.\" Deutsch\u0027s voice was rasping. \"No one told me that.\"\n \"I beg your pardon?\" Barrett had stiffened.\n \"Never mind.\" Deutsch cut him off. \"It\u0027s not that vital, I suppose. My people have recommended you. They say you\u0027re one of the five best in your field.\" He drew in laboring breath. \"Your fee will be one hundred thousand dollars.\"\n Barrett started.\n \"Your assignment is to establish the facts.\"\n \"Regarding what?\" asked Barrett.\n Deutsch seemed hesitant about replying, as though he felt it was beneath him. Finally he said, \"Survival.\"\n \"You want me - ?\"\n \" - to tell me if it\u0027s factual or not.\"\n Barrett\u0027s heart sank. That amount of money would make all the difference in the world to him. Still, how could he in conscience accept it on such grounds?\n \"It isn\u0027t lies I want,\" Deutsch told him. \"I\u0027ll buy the answer, either way. So long as it\u0027s definitive.\"\n Barrett felt a roil of despair. \"How can I convince you, either way?\" He was compelled to say it.\n \"By giving me facts,\" Deutsch answered irritably.\n \"Where am I to find them? I\u0027m a physicist. In the twenty years I\u0027ve studied parapsychology, I\u0027ve yet to - \"\n \"If they exist,\" Deutsch interrupted, \"you\u0027ll find them in the only place on earth I know of where survival has yet to be refuted. The Belasco house in Maine.\"\n \" Hell House? \"\n Something glittered in the old man\u0027s eyes.\n \"Hell House,\" he said.\n Barrett felt a tingling of excitement. \"I thought Belasco\u0027s heirs had it sealed off after what happened - \"\n \"That was thirty years ago.\" Deutsch cut him off again. \"They need the money now; I\u0027ve bought the place. Can you be there by Monday?\"\n Barrett hesitated, then, seeing Deutsch begin to frown, nodded once. \"Yes.\" He couldn\u0027t let this chance go by.\n \"There\u0027ll be two others with you,\" Deutsch said.\n \"May I ask who - ?\"\n \"Florence Tanner and Benjamin Franklin Fischer.\"\n Barrett tried not to show the disappointment he felt. An over-emotive Spiritualist medium, and the lone survivor of the 1940\n debacle? He wondered if he dared object. He had his own group of sensitives and didn\u0027t see how Florence Tanner or Fischer could be of any help to him. Fischer had shown incredible abilities as a boy, but after his breakdown had obviously lost his gift, been caught in fraud a number of times, finally disappearing from the field entirely. He listened, half-attentive, as Deutsch told him that Florence Tanner would fly north with him, while Fischer would meet them in Maine.\n The old man noted his expression. \"Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll be in charge,\" he said; \"Tanner\u0027s only going because my peopie tell me she\u0027s a first-class medium - \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-1.html","bookId":2542,"book":{"id":2542,"title":"Hell House","description":"Storyline: \n Can any soul survive? \n Regarded as the Mount Everest of haunted houses, Belasco House has witnessed scenes of almost unimaginable horror and depravity.
