During the Wars of Conquest, the riverlands belonged to Harren the Black, Kingof the Isles. Harren’s grandfather, King Harwyn Hardhand, had taken the Trident from Arrec theStorm King, whose ancestors had conquered all the way to the Neck three hundred years earlier,slaying the last of the old River Kings. A vain and bloody tyrant, Harren the Black was little lovedby those he ruled, and many of the river lords deserted him to join Aegon’s host. First among themwas Edmyn Tully of Riverrun. When Harren and his line perished in the burning of Harrenhal,Aegon rewarded House Tully by raising Lord Edmyn to dominion over the lands of the Tridentand requiring the other river lords to swear him fealty.

Through the female line, they claim descent from Garth Greenhand, gardener king of the FirstMen, who wore a crown of vines and flowers and made the land bloom. When King Mern, last ofthe old line, perished on the Field of Fire, his steward Harlen Tyrell surrendered Highgarden toAegon Targaryen, pledging fealty. Aegon granted him the castle and dominion over the Reach. The Tyrell sigil is a golden rose on a grass-green field. Their words are Growing Strong.

Legend says theGrey King ruled not only the western isles but the sea itself, and took a mermaid to wife. For thousands of years, raiders from the Iron Islands—called “ironmen” by those they plundered—were the terrors of the seas, sailing as far as the Port of Ibben and the Summer Isles. They pridedthemselves on their fierceness in battle and their sacred freedoms. Each island had its own “saltking” and “rock king.” The High King of the Isles was chosen from among their number, untilKing Urron made the throne hereditary by murdering the other kings when they assembled for achoosing. Urron’s own line was extinguished a thousand years later when the Andals swept overthe islands. The Greyjoys, like other island lords, intermarried with the conquerers. The Iron Kings extended their rule far beyond the isles themselves, carving kingdoms out of themainland with fire and sword. King Qhored could truthfully boast that his writ ran “wherever mencan smell salt water or hear the crash of waves.” In later centuries, Qhored’s descendents lost theArbor, Oldtown, Bear Island, and much of the western shore. Still, come the Wars of Conquest,King Harren the Black ruled all the lands between the mountains, from the Neck to the BlackwaterRush. When Harren and his sons perished in the fall of Harrenhal, Aegon Targaryen granted theriverlands to House Tully, and allowed the surviving lords of the Iron Islands to revive theirancient custom and chose who should have the primacy among them. They chose Lord VickonGreyjoy of Pyke. The Greyjoy sigil is a golden kraken upon a black field. Their words are We Do Not Sow. BALON GREYJOY, Lord of the Iron Islands, King of Salt and Rock, Son ofthe Sea Wind, Lord Reaper of Pyke,. — his wife, LADY ALANNYS, of House Harlaw,. — their children: ○— {RODRIK}, their eldest son, slain at Seagardduring Greyjoy’s Rebellion,○— {MARON}, their second son, slain on the walls ofPyke during Greyjoy’s Rebellion,○— ASHA, their daughter, captain of the Black Wind,○— THEON, their sole surviving son, heir to Pyke, a wardof Lord Eddard Stark, . —his brothers: ○— EURON, called Crow’s Eye, captain of the Silence,an outlaw, pirate, and raider,○— VICTARION, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet,○— AERON, called Damphair, a priest of the Drowned God,Lesser houses sworn to Pyke include Harlaw, Stonehouse, Merlyn, Sunderly, Botley, Tawney,Wynch, Goodbrother. 　　 HOUSE MARTELL Nymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, brought her ten thousand ships to land in Dorne, thesouthernmost of the Seven Kingdoms, and took Lord Mors Martell to husband. With her help, hevanquished his rivals to rule all Dorne. The Rhoynar influence remains strong. Thus Dornish rulersstyle themselves “Prince” rather than “King.” Under Dornish law, lands and titles pass to the eldestchild, not the eldest male. Dorne, alone of the Seven Kingdoms, was never conquered by Aegonthe Dragon. It was not permanently joined to the realm until two hundred years later, and then bymarriage and treaty, not the sword. Peaceable King Daeron II succeeded where the warriors hadfailed by wedding the Dornish princess Myriah and giving his own sister in marriage to thereigning Prince of Dorne. The Martell banner is a red sun pierced by a golden spear. Their wordsare Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.

The Old Dynasty HOUSE TARGARYENThe Targaryens are the blood of the dragon, descended from the high lords of the ancient Freeholdof Valyria, their heritage proclaimed in a striking (some say inhuman) beauty, with lilac or indigoor violet eyes and hair of silver-gold or platinum white. Aegon the Dragon’s ancestors escaped the Doom of Valyria and the chaos and slaughter thatfollowed to settle on Dragonstone, a rocky island in the narrow sea. It was from there that Aegonand his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys sailed to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. To preserve the bloodroyal and keep it pure, House Targaryen has often followed the Valyrian custom of weddingbrother to sister. Aegon himself took both his sisters to wife, and fathered sons on each. TheTargaryen banner is a three-headed dragon, red on black, the three heads representing Aegon andhis sisters. The Targaryen words are Fire and Blood.
