{"id":6753,"no":62,"title":"DAENERYS","content":"When the battle was done, Dany rode her silver through the fields of the dead. Her handmaids andthe men of her khas came after, smiling and jesting among themselves. \n \n Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground, while arakhsand arrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered it with blood. Dying horses lifted their headsand screamed at her as she rode past. Wounded men moaned and prayed. Jaqqa rhan moved amongthem, the mercy men with their heavy axes, taking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike. \n \n After them would scurry a flock of small girls, pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets. \n \n Last of all the dogs would come sniffing, lean and hungry, the feral pack that was never far behind thekhalasar. \n \n The sheep had been dead longest. There seemed to be thousands of them, black with flies, arrowshafts bristling from each carcass. Khal Ogo’s riders had done that, Dany knew; no man of Drogo’skhalasar would be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill. \n \n The town was afire, black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky. \n \n Beneath broken walls of dried mud, riders galloped back and forth, swinging their long whips as theyherded the survivors from the smoking rubble. The women and children of Ogo’s khalasar walkedwith a sullen pride, even in defeat and bondage; they were slaves now, but they seemed not to fear it. \n \n It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them; she remembered what terror felt like. Mothersstumbled along with blank, dead faces, pulling sobbing children by the hand. There were only a fewmen among them, cripples and cowards and grandfathers. \n \n Ser Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen, but the Dothraki calledthem haesh rakhi, the Lamb Men. Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki, for they had thesame copper skin and almond-shaped eyes. Now they looked alien to her, squat and flat-faced, theirblack hair cropped unnaturally short. They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and KhalDrogo said they belonged south of the river bend. The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant forsheep. \n \n Dany saw one boy bolt and run for the river. A rider cut him off and turned him, and the othersboxed him in, cracking their whips in his face, running him this way and that. One galloped behindhim, lashing him across the buttocks until his thighs ran red with blood. Another snared his ankle witha lash and sent him sprawling. Finally, when the boy could only crawl, they grew bored of the sportand put an arrow through his back. \n \n Ser Jorah met her outside the shattered gate. He wore a dark green surcoat over his mail. Hisgauntlets, greaves, and greathelm were dark grey steel. The Dothraki had mocked him for a cowardwhen he donned his armor, but the knight had spit insults right back in their teeth, tempers had flared,longsword had clashed with arakh, and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behindto bleed to death. \n \n Ser Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up. “Your lord husband awaits youwithin the town.” \n \n “Drogo took no harm?” \n \n “A few cuts,” Ser Jorah answered, “nothing of consequence. He slew two khals this day. KhalOgo first, and then the son, Fogo, who became khal when Ogo fell. His bloodriders cut the bells fromtheir hair, and now Khal Drogo’s every step rings louder than before.” \n \n Ogo and his son had shared the high bench with her lord husband at the naming feast whereViserys had been crowned, but that was in Vaes Dothrak, beneath the Mother of Mountains, whereevery rider was a brother and all quarrels were put aside. It was different out in the grass. Ogo’skhalasar had been attacking the town when Khal Drogo caught him. She wondered what the LambMen had thought, when they first saw the dust of their horses from atop those cracked-mud walls. \n \n Perhaps a few, the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods heard the prayers ofdesperate men, took it for deliverance. \n \n fdesperate men, took it for deliverance. \n \n Across the road, a girl no older than Dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved herover a pile of corpses, facedown, and thrust himself inside her. Other riders dismounted to take theirturns. That was the sort of deliverance the Dothraki brought the Lamb Men. \n \n I am the blood of the dragon, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself as she turned her face away. \n \n She pressed her lips together and hardened her heart and rode on toward the gate. \n \n “Most of Ogo’s riders fled,” Ser Jorah was saying. “Still, there may be as many as ten thousandcaptives.” \n \n Slaves, Dany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver’sBay. She wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this is what it lookslike, this is the price of the Iron Throne. \n \n “I’ve told the khal he ought to make for Meereen,” Ser Jorah said. “They’ll pay a better price thanhe’d get from a slaving caravan. Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year, so the brothels arepaying double for healthy young girls, and triple for boys under ten. If enough children survive thejourney, the gold will buy us all the ships we need, and hire men to sail them.” \n \n Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending sound, a long sobbing wail that went on andon and on. Dany’s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she turned the silver’s head. “Make themstop,” she commanded Ser Jorah. \n \n “Khaleesi?” The knight sounded perplexed. \n \n “You heard my words,” she said. “Stop them.” She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents ofDothraki. “Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah. I want no rape.” \n \n The warriors exchanged a baffled look. \n \n Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer. “Princess,” he said, “you have a gentle heart, but you donot understand. This is how it has always been. Those men have shed blood for the khal. Now theyclaim their reward.” \n \n Across the road, the girl was still crying, her high singsong tongue strange to Dany’s ears. The firstman was done with her now, and a second had taken his place. \n \n “She is a lamb girl,” Quaro said in Dothraki. “She is nothing, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. \n \n The Lamb Men lay with sheep, it is known.” \n \n “It is known,” her handmaid Irri echoed. \n \n “It is known,” agreed Jhogo, astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given him. “If herwailing offends your ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue.” He drew his arakh. \n \n “I will not have her harmed,” Dany said. “I claim her. Do as I command you, or Khal Drogo willknow the reason why.” \n \n “Ai, Khaleesi,” Jhogo replied, kicking his horse. Quaro and the others followed his lead, the bellsin their hair chiming. \n \n “Go with them,” she commanded Ser Jorah. \n \n “As you command.” The knight gave her a curious look. “You are your brother’s sister, in truth.” \n \n “Viserys?” She did not understand. \n \n “No,” he answered. “Rhaegar.” He galloped off. \n \n Dany heard Jhogo shout. The rapers laughed at him. One man shouted back. Jhogo’s arakh flashed,and the man’s head went tumbling from his shoulders. Laughter turned to curses as the horsemenreached for weapons, but by then Quaro and Aggo and Rakharo were there. She saw Aggo pointacross the road to where she sat upon her silver. The riders looked at her with cold black eyes. Onespat. The others scattered to their mounts, muttering. \n \n All the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of her, so intent on hispleasure that he seemed unaware of what was going on around him. Ser Jorah dismounted andwrenched him off with a mailed hand. The Dothraki went sprawling in the mud, bounced up with aknife in hand, and died with Aggo’s arrow through his throat. Mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her in his blood-spattered cloak. He led her across the road to Dany. “What doyou want done with her?” \n \n d-spattered cloak. He led her across the road to Dany. “What doyou want done with her?” \n \n The girl was trembling, her eyes wide and vague. Her hair was matted with blood. “Doreah, see toher hurts. You do not have a rider’s look, perhaps she will not fear you. The rest, with me.” She urgedthe silver through the broken wooden gate. \n \n It was worse inside the town. Many of the houses were afire, and the jaqqa rhan had been abouttheir grisly work. Headless corpses filled the narrow, twisty lanes. They passed other women beingraped. Each time Dany reined up, sent her khas to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave. \n \n One of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany haltingly in the CommonTongue, but from the others she got only flat black stares. They were suspicious of her, she realizedwith sadness; afraid that she had saved them for some worse fate. \n \n “You cannot claim them all, child,” Ser Jorah said, the fourth time they stopped, while thewarriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her. \n \n “I am khaleesi, heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the blood of the dragon,” Dany reminded him. “It isnot for you to tell me what I cannot do.” Across the city, a building collapsed in a great gout of fireand smoke, and she heard distant screams and the wailing of frightened children. \n \n They found Khal Drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick mud walls and abulbous dome like some immense brown onion. Beside him was a pile of heads taller than he was. \n \n One of the short arrows of the Lamb Men stuck through the meat of his upper arm, and blood coveredthe left side of his bare chest like a splash of paint. His three bloodriders were with him. \n \n Jhiqui helped Dany dismount; she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger and heavier. Sheknelt before the khal. “My sun-and-stars is wounded.” The arakh cut was wide but shallow; his leftnipple was gone, and a flap of bloody flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag. \n \n “Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo,” Khal Drogo said in theCommon Tongue. “I kill him for it, and Ogo too.” He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringingsoftly. “Is Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him.” \n \n “No man can stand before the sun of my life,” Dany said, “the father of the stallion who mountsthe world.” \n \n A mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from his saddle. He spoke to Haggo, a stream of angryDothraki too fast for Dany to understand. The huge bloodrider gave her a heavy look before he turnedto his khal. “This one is Mago, who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo. He says the khaleesi has taken hisspoils, a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount.” \n \n Khal Drogo’s face was still and hard, but his black eyes were curious as they went to Dany. “Tellme the truth of this, moon of my life,” he commanded in Dothraki. \n \n Dany told him what she had done, in his own tongue so the khal would understand her better, herwords simple and direct. \n \n When she was done, Drogo was frowning. “This is the way of war. These women are our slavesnow, to do with as we please.” \n \n “It pleases me to hold them safe,” Dany said, wondering if she had dared too much. “If yourwarriors would mount these women, let them take them gently and keep them for wives. Give themplaces in the khalasar and let them bear you sons.” \n \n Qotho was ever the cruelest of the bloodriders. It was he who laughed. “Does the horse breed withthe sheep?” \n \n Something in his tone reminded her of Viserys. Dany turned on him angrily. “The dragon feeds onhorse and sheep alike.” \n \n Khal Drogo smiled. “See how fierce she grows!” he said. “It is my son inside her, the stallion whomounts the world, filling her with his fire. Ride slowly, Qotho … if the mother does not burn youwhere you sit, the son will trample you into the mud. And you, Mago, hold your tongue and findanother lamb to mount. These belong to my khaleesi.” He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys, butas he lifted his arm Drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head. \n \n Dany could almost feel his agony. The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had led her to believe. \n \n “Where are the healers?” she demanded. The khalasar had two sorts: barren women and eunuchslaves. The herbwomen dealt in potions and spells, the eunuchs in knife, needle, and fire. “Why dothey not attend the khal?” \n \n “The khal sent the hairless men away, Khaleesi,” old Cohollo assured her. Dany saw the bloodrider had taken a wound himself; a deep gash in his left shoulder. loodrider had taken a wound himself; a deep gash in his left shoulder. \n \n “Many riders are hurt,” Khal Drogo said stubbornly. “Let them be healed first. This arrow is nomore than the bite of a fly, this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son.” \n \n Dany could see the muscles in his chest where the skin had been cut away. A trickle of blood ranfrom the arrow that pierced his arm. “It is not for Khal Drogo to wait,” she proclaimed. “Jhogo, seekout these eunuchs and bring them here at once.” \n \n “Silver Lady,” a woman’s voice said behind her, “I can help the Great Rider with his hurts.” \n \n Dany turned her head. The speaker was one of the slaves she had claimed, the heavy, flat-nosedwoman who had blessed her. \n \n “The khal needs no help from women who lie with sheep,” barked Qotho. “Aggo, cut out hertongue.” \n \n Aggo grabbed her hair and pressed a knife to her throat. \n \n Dany lifted a hand. “No. She is mine. Let her speak.” \n \n Aggo looked from her to Qotho. He lowered his knife. \n \n “I meant no wrong, fierce riders.” The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes she wore had oncebeen the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with embroidery, but now they were mud-caked andbloody and ripped. She clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. “I have some smallskill in the healing arts.” \n \n “Who are you?” Dany asked her. \n \n “I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I am godswife of this temple.” \n \n “Maegi,” grunted Haggo, fingering his arakh. His look was dark. Dany remembered the wordfrom a terrifying story that Jhiqui had told her one night by the cookfire. A maegi was a woman wholay with demons and practiced the blackest of sorceries, a vile thing, evil and soulless, who came tomen in the dark of night and sucked life and strength from their bodies. \n \n “I am a healer,” Mirri Maz Duur said. \n \n “A healer of sheeps,” sneered Qotho. “Blood of my blood, I say kill this maegi and wait for thehairless men.” \n \n Dany ignored the bloodrider’s outburst. This old, homely, thick-bodied woman did not look like amaegi to her. “Where did you learn your healing, Mirri Maz Duur?” \n \n “My mother was godswife before me, and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to theGreat Shepherd, and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry. \n \n When I was younger and more fair, I went in caravan to Asshai by the Shadow, to learn from theirmages. Ships from many lands come to Asshai, so I lingered long to study the healing ways of distantpeoples. A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a woman of your ownriding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Landsopened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin.” \n \n Ser Jorah Mormont spoke up. “A maester?” \n \n “Marwyn, he named himself,” the woman replied in the Common Tongue. “From the sea. Beyondthe sea. The Seven Lands, he said. Sunset Lands. Where men are iron and dragons rule. He taught methis speech.” \n \n “A maester in Asshai,” Ser Jorah mused. “Tell me, Godswife, what did this Marwyn wear abouthis neck?” \n \n “A chain so tight it was like to choke him, Iron Lord, with links of many metals.” \n \n The knight looked at Dany. “Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown wears such a chain,” hesaid, “and such men do know much of healing.” \n \n “Why should you want to help my khal?” \n \n “All men are one flock, or so we are taught,” replied Mirri Maz Duur. “The Great Shepherd sentme to earth to heal his lambs, wherever I might find them.” \n \n Qotho gave her a stinging slap. “We are no sheep, maegi.” \n \n “Stop it,” Dany said angrily. “She is mine. I will not have her harmed.” \n \n Khal Drogo grunted. “The arrow must come out, Qotho.” \n \n “Yes, Great Rider,” Mirri Maz Duur answered, touching her bruised face. “And your breast mustbe washed and sewn, lest the wound fester.” \n \n “Do it, then,” Khal Drogo commanded. \n \n “Great Rider,” the woman said, “my tools and potions are inside the god’s house, where thehealing powers are strongest.” \n \n d’s house, where thehealing powers are strongest.” \n \n “I will carry you, blood of my blood,” Haggo offered. \n \n Khal Drogo waved him away. “I need no man’s help,” he said, in a voice proud and hard. He stood,unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down his breast, from where Ogo’s arakhhad cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly to his side. “I am no man,” she whispered, “so you maylean on me.” Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as they walkedtoward the great mud temple. The three bloodriders followed. Dany commanded Ser Jorah and thewarriors of her khas to guard the entrance and make certain no one set the building afire while theywere still inside. \n \n They passed through a series of anterooms, into the high central chamber under the onion. Faintlight shone down through hidden windows above. A few torches burnt smokily from sconces on thewalls. Sheepskins were scattered across the mud floor. “There,” Mirri Maz Duur said, pointing to thealtar, a massive blue-veined stone carved with images of shepherds and their flocks. Khal Drogo layupon it. The old woman threw a handful of dried leaves onto a brazier, filling the chamber withfragrant smoke. “Best if you wait outside,” she told the rest of them. \n \n “We are blood of his blood,” Cohollo said. “Here we wait.” \n \n Qotho stepped close to Mirri Maz Duur. “Know this, wife of the Lamb God. Harm the khal and yousuffer the same.” He drew his skinning knife and showed her the blade. \n \n “She will do no harm.” Dany felt she could trust this old, plain-faced woman with her flat nose;she had saved her from the hard hands of her rapers, after all. \n \n “If you must stay, then help,” Mirri told the bloodriders. “The Great Rider is too strong for me. \n \n Hold him still while I draw the arrow from his flesh.” She let the rags of her gown fall to her waist asshe opened a carved chest, and busied herself with bottles and boxes, knives and needles. When shewas ready, she broke off the barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft, chanting in the singsongtongue of the Lhazareen. She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured it over hiswounds. Khal Drogo cursed her, but he did not move. She bound the arrow wound with a plaster ofwet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast, smearing it with a pale green paste before she pulledthe flap of skin back in place. The khal ground his teeth together and swallowed a scream. Thegodswife took out a silver needle and a bobbin of silk thread and began to close the flesh. When shewas done she painted the skin with red ointment, covered it with more leaves, and bound the breast ina ragged piece of lambskin. “You must say the prayers I give you and keep the lambskin in place forten days and ten nights,” she said. “There will be fever, and itching, and a great scar when the healingis done.” \n \n Khal Drogo sat, bells ringing. “I sing of my scars, sheep woman.” He flexed his arm and scowled. \n \n “Drink neither wine nor the milk of the poppy,” she cautioned him. “Pain you will have, but youmust keep your body strong to fight the poison spirits.” \n \n “I am khal,” Drogo said. “I spit on pain and drink what I like. Cohollo, bring my vest.” The olderman hastened off. \n \n “Before,” Dany said to the ugly Lhazareen woman, “I heard you speak of birthing songs …” \n \n “I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a babe,” Mirri Maz Duurreplied. \n \n “My time is near,” Dany said. “I would have you attend me when he comes, if you would.” \n \n Khal Drogo laughed. “Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell her. She will do as youcommand.” He jumped down from the altar. “Come, my blood. The stallions call, this place is ashes. \n \n It is time to ride.” \n \n Haggo followed the khal from the temple, but Qotho lingered long enough to favor Mirri Maz Duurwith a stare. “Remember, maegi, as the khal fares, so shall you.” \n \n “As you say, rider,” the woman answered him, gathering up her jars and bottles. “The GreatShepherd guards the flock.” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1029/30977.html","bookId":217,"book":{"id":217,"title":"冰与火之歌：权力的游戏 A Game of Thrones","description":"简介： 故事主要发生在一个架空的大陆：维斯特洛上的七大王国。维斯特洛是一片大约有南美洲那么大的大陆，有可以上溯到12000年前的悠久历史。在那里每一个季节通常持续数年。这片大陆的原住民是森林之子。森林之子与大自然和谐共处，并且使用魔法。先民们最早期的武士带着青铜...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201405/13/14-32-50-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1029","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
