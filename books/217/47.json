{"id":6738,"no":47,"title":"DAENERYS","content":"The heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set it before her, raw and bloody. \n \n His arms were red to the elbow. Behind him, his bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of thewild stallion, stone knives in their hands. The stallion’s blood looked black in the flickering orangeglare of the torches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit. \n \n Dany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow. Shecould feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone darkas polished flint in their wrinkled faces. She must not flinch or look afraid. I am the blood of thedragon, she told herself as she took the stallion’s heart in both hands, lifted it to her mouth, andplunged her teeth into the tough, stringy flesh. \n \n Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened to gag her, but shemade herself chew and swallow. The heart of a stallion would make her son strong and swift andfearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could eat it all. If she choked on the bloodor retched up the flesh, the omens were less favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forthweak, deformed, or female. \n \n Her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender mother’s stomachthat had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls of half-clotted blood toaccustom herself to the taste, and Irri made her chew strips of dried horseflesh until her jaws wereaching. She had starved herself for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hungerwould help her keep down the raw meat. \n \n The wild stallion’s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it with her teeth and chew eachmouthful a long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred confines of Vaes Dothrak, beneath theshadow of the Mother of Mountains; she had to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails. Her stomachroiled and heaved, yet she kept on, her face smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed toexplode against her lips. \n \n Khal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face as hard as a bronze shield. His long black braid wasshiny with oil. He wore gold rings in his mustache, gold bells in his braid, and a heavy belt of solidgold medallions around his waist, but his chest was bare. She looked at him whenever she felt herstrength failing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, chewed andswallowed. Toward the end, Dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almond-shapedeyes, but she could not be sure. The khal’s face did not often betray the thoughts within. \n \n And finally it was done. Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of it. Onlythen did she turn her eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen. \n \n “Khalakka dothrae mr’anha!” she proclaimed in her best Dothraki. A prince rides inside me! Shehad practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui. \n \n The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye, raised herarms on high. “Khalakka dothrae!” she shrieked. The prince is riding! \n \n “He is riding!” the other women answered. “Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!” they proclaimed. A boy, aboy, a strong boy. \n \n Bells rang, a sudden clangor of bronze birds. A deep-throated warhorn sounded its long low note. \n \n The old women began to chant. Underneath their painted leather vests, their withered dugs swayedback and forth, shiny with oil and sweat. The eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze brazier, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up toward the moon and thestars. The Dothraki believed the stars were horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped across thesky by night. \n \n As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single eye, thebetter to peer into the future. The silence that fell was complete. Dany could hear the distant call ofnight birds, the hiss and crackle of the torches, the gentle lapping of water from the lake. TheDothraki stared at her with eyes of night, waiting. \n \n Khal Drogo laid his hand on Dany’s arm. She could feel the tension in his fingers. Even a khal asmighty as Drogo could know fear when the dosh khaleen peered into smoke of the future. At herback, her handmaids fluttered anxiously. \n \n Finally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms. “I have seen his face, and heard the thunder ofhis hooves,” she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice. \n \n “The thunder of his hooves!” the others chorused. \n \n “As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men withoutnumber, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this princewill be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend theirflesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fearhis name.” The old woman trembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid. “The prince isriding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.” \n \n “The stallion who mounts the world!” the onlookers cried in echo, until the night rang to thesound of their voices. \n \n The one-eyed crone peered at Dany. “What shall he be called, the stallion who mounts the world?” \n \n She stood to answer. “He shall be called Rhaego,” she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taughther. Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki. \n \n “Rhaego,” they screamed. “Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!” \n \n The name was still ringing in her ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit. His bloodriders fell inbehind them. A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the broad grassy road that ranthrough the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of thedosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carvedstaffs as they struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. \n \n Each of the old women had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal tookhis place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were sent here, toreign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority ofthe dosh khaleen. Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them,whether she willed it or no. \n \n Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal Jommoand his wives, the chief men of Drogo’s khalasar, Dany’s handmaids, the khal’s servants and slaves,and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they marched along the godsway. Stolenheroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond the road. Alongside theprocession, slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands, and the flickering flamesmade the great monuments seem almost alive. \n \n “What is meaning, name Rhaego?” Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using the Common Tongueof the Seven Kingdoms. She had been teaching him a few words when she could. Drogo was quick tolearn when he put his mind to it, though his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorahnor Viserys could understand a word he said. \n \n “My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,” she told him. “He died before I wasborn. Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons.” \n \n Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet under the long black mustache,drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings, she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile. “Isgood name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life,” he said. \n \n They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a fringe of reeds,its water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emergedfrom its depths, riding upon the back of the first horse. \n \n The procession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to theground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the tall reeds. The moon floated on thestill black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on herpale skin as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion’s blood had driedon her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over herhead, cleansing herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard theold women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what theywere saying. \n \n rpale skin as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion’s blood had driedon her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over herhead, cleansing herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard theold women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what theywere saying. \n \n When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried to her witha robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away. He was looking on her swollen breastsand the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the shape of his manhood pressingthrough his horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of his belt. She went to him andhelped him unlace. Then her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lifta child. The bells in his hair rang softly. \n \n Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrusthimself inside her. Three quick strokes and it was done. “The stallion who mounts the world,” Drogowhispered hoarsely. His hands still smelled of horse blood. He bit at her throat, hard, in the momentof his pleasure, and when he lifted her off, his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of herthighs. Only then was Doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit softslippers to her feet. \n \n Khal Drogo laced himself up and spoke a command, and horses were brought to the lakeshore. \n \n Cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver. Drogo spurred his stallion, and set offdown the godsway beneath the moon and stars. On her silver, Dany easily kept pace. \n \n The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo’s hall had been rolled up tonight, and the moon followedthem inside. Flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge stone-lined firepits. The air was thickwith the smells of roasting meat and curdled, fermented mare’s milk. The hall was crowded and noisywhen they entered, the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allowthem at the ceremony. As Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle, every eye wason her. The Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts, hailing the life within her. \n \n She could not understand all they shouted, but one phrase came clear. “The stallion that mounts theworld,” she heard, bellowed in a thousand voices. \n \n The sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night. Half-clothed women spun and danced onthe low tables, amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and dates and pomegranates. \n \n Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare’s milk, yet Dany knew no arakhs would clash tonight,not here in the sacred city, where blades and bloodshed were forbidden. \n \n Khal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench. Khal Jommo and Khal Ogo, who hadbeen in Vaes Dothrak with their khalasars when they arrived, were given seats of high honor toDrogo’s right and left. The bloodriders of the three khals sat below them, and farther down KhalJommo’s four wives. \n \n Dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves. As Doreah and Irri arranged hercushions, she searched for her brother. Even across the length of the crowded hall, Viserys shouldhave been conspicuous with his pale skin, silvery hair, and beggar’s rags, but she did not see himanywhere. \n \n Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose braids were even shorterthan their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables, but all the faces shesaw had black eyes and copper skin. She spied Ser Jorah Mormont near the center of the hall, close tothe middle firepit. It was a place of respect, if not high honor; the Dothraki esteemed the knight’sprowess with a sword. Dany sent Jhiqui to bring him to her table. Mormont came at once, and went toone knee before her. “Khaleesi,” he said, “I am yours to command.” \n \n She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her. “Sit and talk with me.” \n \n “You honor me.” The knight seated himself cross-legged on the cushion. A slave knelt beforehim, offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs. Ser Jorah took one and bit it in half. \n \n “Where is my brother?” Dany asked. “He ought to have come by now, for the feast.” \n \n “I saw His Grace this morning,” he told her. “He told me he was going to the Western Market, insearch of wine.” \n \n “Wine?” Dany said doubtfully. Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare’s milk the Dothraki drank, she knew that, and he was oft at the bazaars these days, drinking with the traderswho came in the great caravans from east and west. He seemed to find their company more congenialthan hers. \n \n “Wine,” Ser Jorah confirmed, “and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from thesellswords who guard the caravans.” A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him, and he attacked itwith both hands. \n \n “Is that wise?” she asked. “He has no gold to pay soldiers. What if he’s betrayed?” Caravanguards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor, and the Usurper in King’s Landing wouldpay well for her brother’s head. “You ought to have gone with him, to keep him safe. You are hissworn sword.” \n \n “We are in Vaes Dothrak,” he reminded her. “No one may carry a blade here or shed a man’sblood.” \n \n “Yet men die,” she said. “Jhogo told me. Some of the traders have eunuchs with them, huge menwho strangle thieves with wisps of silk. That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered.” \n \n “Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything.” Ser Jorah wiped thegrease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table. “He had planned totake your dragon’s eggs, until I warned him that I’d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them.” \n \n For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words. “My eggs … but they’re mine, MagisterIllyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want … they’re only stones …” \n \n “The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, Princess … and dragon’s eggs arerarer by far. Those traders he’s been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one ofthose stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need.” \n \n Dany had not known, had not even suspected. “Then … he should have them. He does not need tosteal them. He had only to ask. He is my brother … and my true king.” \n \n “He is your brother,” Ser Jorah acknowledged. \n \n “You do not understand, ser,” she said. “My mother died giving me birth, and my father and mybrother Rhaegar even before that. I would never have known so much as their names if Viserys hadnot been there to tell me. He was the only one left. The only one. He is all I have.” \n \n “Once,” said Ser Jorah. “No longer, Khaleesi. You belong to the Dothraki now. In your wombrides the stallion who mounts the world.” He held out his cup, and a slave filled it with fermentedmare’s milk, sour-smelling and thick with clots. \n \n Dany waved her away. Even the smell of it made her feel ill, and she would take no chances ofbringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat. “What does it mean?” she asked. “What isthis stallion? Everyone was shouting it at me, but I don’t understand.” \n \n “The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy, child. He will unite the Dothrakiinto a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth, or so it was promised. All the people of theworld will be his herd.” \n \n “Oh,” Dany said in a small voice. Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of herstomach. “I named him Rhaego.” \n \n “A name to make the Usurper’s blood run cold.” \n \n Suddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow. “My lady,” the handmaid whispered urgently, “yourbrother …” \n \n Dany looked down the length of the long, roofless hall and there he was, striding toward her. Fromthe lurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys had found his wine … and something thatpassed for courage. \n \n He was wearing his scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained. His cloak and gloves were black velvet,faded from the sun. His boots were dry and cracked, his silver-blond hair matted and tangled. Alongsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard. The Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed;Dany heard curses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her, like a tide. The music diedaway in a nervous stammering of drums. \n \n A sense of dread closed around her heart. “Go to him,” she commanded Ser Jorah. “Stop him. \n \n Bring him here. Tell him he can have the dragon’s eggs if that is what he wants.” The knight roseswiftly to his feet. \n \n “Where is my sister?” Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine. “I’ve come for her feast. Howdare you presume to eat without me? No one eats before the king. Where is she? The whore can’t hide from the dragon.” \n \n He stopped beside the largest of the three firepits, peering around at the faces of the Dothraki. \n \n There were five thousand men in the hall, but only a handful who knew the Common Tongue. Yeteven if his words were incomprehensible, you had only to look at him to know that he was drunk. \n \n Ser Jorah went to him swiftly, whispered something in his ear, and took him by the arm, butViserys wrenched free. “Keep your hands off me! No one touches the dragon without leave.” \n \n Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench. Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khalsbeside him. Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly. \n \n The sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes. “Khal Drogo,” he said thickly, his voice almostpolite. “I’m here for the feast.” He staggered away from Ser Jorah, making to join the three khals onthe high bench. \n \n Khal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could understand, andpointed. “Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,” Ser Jorah translated for her brother. \n \n “Khal Drogo says your place is there.” \n \n Viserys glanced where the khal was pointing. At the back of the long hall, in a corner by the wall,deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them, sat the lowest of the low; rawunblooded boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted and the maimed. Far fromthe meat, and farther from honor. “That is no place for a king,” her brother declared. \n \n “Is place,” Khal Drogo answered, in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught him, “forSorefoot King.” He clapped his hands together. “A cart! Bring cart for Khal Rhaggat!” \n \n Five thousand Dothraki began to laugh and shout. Ser Jorah was standing beside Viserys,screaming in his ear, but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that Dany could not hear what he wassaying. Her brother shouted back and the two men grappled, until Mormont knocked Viserys bodilyto the floor. \n \n Her brother drew his sword. \n \n The bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits. “Keep away from me!” Viseryshissed. Ser Jorah backed off a step, and her brother climbed unsteadily to his feet. He waved thesword over his head, the borrowed blade that Magister Illyrio had given him to make him seem morekingly. Dothraki were shrieking at him from all sides, screaming vile curses. \n \n Dany gave a wordless cry of terror. She knew what a drawn sword meant here, even if her brotherdid not. \n \n Her voice made Viserys turn his head, and he saw her for the first time. “There she is,” he said,smiling. He stalked toward her, slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a wall of enemies, thoughno one tried to bar his way. \n \n “The blade … you must not,” she begged him. “Please, Viserys. It is forbidden. Put down thesword and come share my cushions. There’s drink, food … is it the dragon’s eggs you want? You canhave them, only throw away the sword.” \n \n “Do as she tells you, fool,” Ser Jorah shouted, “before you get us all killed.” \n \n Viserys laughed. “They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood here in the sacred city … but I can.” \n \n He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of herbelly. “I want what I came for,” he told her. “I want the crown he promised me. He bought you, buthe never paid for you. Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I’m taking you back. You and the eggsboth. He can keep his bloody foal. I’ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.” The sword pointpushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping andlaughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her brother. \n \n Distantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, pleading that shedared not translate, that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse all the way up theMother of Mountains. She put her arm around the girl. “Don’t be afraid,” she said. “I shall tell him.” \n \n She did not know if she had enough words, yet when she was done Khal Drogo spoke a fewbrusque sentences in Dothraki, and she knew he understood. The sun of her life stepped down fromthe high bench. “What did he say?” the man who had been her brother asked her, flinching. \n \n It had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in Khal Drogo’s hair, chiming softlywith each step he took. His bloodriders followed him, like three copper shadows. Daenerys had gonecold all over. “He says you shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.” \n \n Viserys smiled and lowered his sword. That was the saddest thing, the thing that tore at her afterward … the way he smiled. “That was all I wanted,” he said. “What was promised.” \n \n When the sun of her life reached her, Dany slid an arm around his waist. The khal said a word, andhis bloodriders leapt forward. Qotho seized the man who had been her brother by the arms. Haggoshattered his wrist with a single, sharp twist of his huge hands. Cohollo pulled the sword from hislimp fingers. Even now Viserys did not understand. “No,” he shouted, “you cannot touch me, I am thedragon, the dragon, and I will be crowned!” \n \n Khal Drogo unfastened his belt. The medallions were pure gold, massive and ornate, each one aslarge as a man’s hand. He shouted a command. Cook slaves pulled a heavy iron stew pot from thefirepit, dumped the stew onto the ground, and returned the pot to the flames. Drogo tossed in the beltand watched without expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose their shape. She couldsee fires dancing in the onyx of his eyes. A slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair mittens, and hepulled them on, never so much as looking at the man. \n \n Viserys began to scream the high, wordless scream of the coward facing death. He kicked andtwisted, whimpered like a dog and wept like a child, but the Dothraki held him tight between them. \n \n Ser Jorah had made his way to Dany’s side. He put a hand on her shoulder. “Turn away, my princess,I beg you.” \n \n “No.” She folded her arms across the swell of her belly, protectively. \n \n At the last, Viserys looked at her. “Sister, please … Dany, tell them … make them … sweetsister …” \n \n When the gold was half-melted and starting to run, Drogo reached into the flames, snatched out thepot. “Crown!” he roared. “Here. A crown for Cart King!” And upended the pot over the head of theman who had been her brother. \n \n The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his face was likenothing human. His feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor, slowed, stopped. Thick globsof molten gold dripped down onto his chest, setting the scarlet silk to smoldering … yet no drop ofblood was spilled. \n \n He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1029/30962.html","bookId":217,"book":{"id":217,"title":"冰与火之歌：权力的游戏 A Game of Thrones","description":"简介： 故事主要发生在一个架空的大陆：维斯特洛上的七大王国。维斯特洛是一片大约有南美洲那么大的大陆，有可以上溯到12000年前的悠久历史。在那里每一个季节通常持续数年。这片大陆的原住民是森林之子。森林之子与大自然和谐共处，并且使用魔法。先民们最早期的武士带着青铜...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201405/13/14-32-50-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1029","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
