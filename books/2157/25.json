{"id":97413,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"The artisan who created this transformation was an old woman with glittering gray-green eyes. \"You are now a Tleilaxu Master,\" she said. \"Your name is Wose. A guide will take you to the next place. You will treat him like a Face Dancer if you meet strangers. Otherwise, do as he commands.\" They led him out of the cave complex along a twisting passage, its walls and ceiling thick with the musky green algae. In starlighted darkness, they thrust him from the passage into a chilly night and the hands of an unseen man - a bulky figure in padded clothing. A voice behind Duncan whispered: \"Here he is, Ambitorm. Get him through.\" The guide spoke in an accent of gutturals: \"Follow me.\" He clipped a lead cord to Duncan\u0027s belt, adjusted the night goggles and turned away. Duncan felt the cord tug once and they were off. Duncan recognized the use of the cord. It was not something to keep him close behind. He could see this Ambitorm clearly enough with the night goggles. No, the cord was to spill him quickly if they met danger. No need for a command. For a long time during the night they crisscrossed small ice-lined watercourses on a flatland. The light of Gammu\u0027s early moons penetrated the covering growth only occasionally. They emerged finally onto a low hill with a view of bushy wasteland all silvery with snow cover in the moonlight. Down into this they went. The bushes, about twice the height of the guide, arched over muddy animal passages little larger than the tunnels where they had begun this journey. It was warmer here, the warmth of a compost heap. Almost no light penetrated to a ground spongy with rotted vegetation. Duncan inhaled the fungal odors of decomposing plant life. The night goggles showed him a seemingly endless repetition of thick growth on both sides. The cord linking him to Ambitorm was a tenuous grip on an alien world. Ambitorm discouraged conversation. He said \"Yes,\" when Duncan asked confirmation of the man\u0027s name, then: \"Don\u0027t talk.\" The whole night was a disquieting traverse for Duncan. He did not like being thrown back into his own thoughts. Giedi Prime memories persisted. This place was like nothing he remembered from his pre-ghola youth. He wondered how Ambitorm had learned the way through here and how he remembered it. One animal tunnel appeared much like another. In the steady, jogging pace there was time for Duncan\u0027s thoughts to roam. Must I permit the Sisterhood to use me? What do I owe them? And he thought of Teg, that last gallant stand to permit two of them to escape. I did the same for Paul and Jessica. It was a bond with Teg and it touched Duncan with grief. Teg was loyal to the Sisterhood. Did he buy my loyalty with that last brave act? Damn the Atreides! The night\u0027s exertions increased Duncan\u0027s familiarity with his new flesh. How young this body was! A small lurch of recollection and he could see that last pre-ghola memory; he could feel the Sardaukar blade strike his head - a blinding explosion of pain and light. Knowledge of his certain death and then... nothing until that moment with Teg in the Harkonnen no-globe. The gift of another life. Was it more than a gift or something less? The Atreides were demanding another payment from him. For a time just before dawn, Ambitorm led him at a sloshing run along a narrow stream whose icy chill penetrated the waterproof insulated boots of Duncan\u0027s Tleilaxu garments. The watercourse reflected bush-shadowed silver from the light of the planet\u0027s pre-dawn moon setting ahead of them. Daylight saw them come out into the larger, tree-shielded animal track and up the steep hill. This passage emerged onto a narrow rocky ledge below a ridgetop of sawtoothed boulders. Ambitorm led him behind a screen of dead brown bushes, their tops dirty with wind-blown snow. He released the cord from Duncan\u0027s belt. Directly in front of them was a shallow declivity in the rocks, not quite a cave, but Duncan saw that it would offer some protection unless they got a hard wind over the bushes behind them. There was no snow on the floor of the place. Ambitorm went to the back of the declivity and carefully removed a layer of icy dirt and several flat rocks, which concealed a small pit. He lifted a round black object from the pit and busied himself over it. Duncan squatted under the overhang and studied his guide. Ambitorm had a dished-in face with skin like dark brown leather. Yes, those could be the features of a Face Dancer. Deep creases cut into the skin at the edges of the man\u0027s brown eyes. Creases radiated from the sides of the thin mouth and lined the wide brow. They spread out beside the flat nose and deepened the cleft of a narrow chin. Creases of time all over his face. Appetizing odors began to arise from the black object in front of Ambitorm. \"We will eat here and wait a bit before we continue,\" Ambitorm said. He spoke Old Galach but with that guttural accent which Duncan had never heard before, an odd stress on adjacent vowels. Was Ambitorm from the Scattering or a Gammu native? There obviously had been many linguistic drifts since the Dune days of Muad\u0027dib. For that matter, Duncan recognized that all of the people in the Gammu Keep, including Teg and Lucilla, spoke a Galach that had shifted from the one he had learned as a pre-ghola child. \"Ambitorm,\" Duncan said. \"Is that a Gammu name?\" \"You will call me Tormsa,\" the guide said. \"Is that a nickname?\" \"It is what you will call me.\" \"Why did those people back there call you Ambitorm.\" \"That was the name I gave them.\" \"But why would you...\" \"You lived under the Harkonnens and you did not learn how to change your identity?\" Duncan fell silent. Was that it? Another disguise. Ambi... Tormsa had not changed his appearance. Tormsa. Was it a Tleilaxu name? The guide extended a steaming cup toward Duncan. \"A drink to restore you, Wose. Drink it fast. It will keep you warm.\" Duncan closed both hands around the cup. Wose. Wose and Tormsa. Tleilaxu Master and his Face Dancer companion. Duncan lifted the cup toward Tormsa in the ancient gesture of Atreides battle comrades, then put it to his lips. Hot! But it warmed him as it went down. The drink had a faintly sweet flavor over some vegetable tang. He blew on it and drank it down as he saw Tormsa was doing. Odd that I should not suspect poison or some drug, Duncan thought. But this Tormsa and the others last night had something of the Bashar about them. The gesture to a battle comrade had come naturally. \"Why are you risking your life this way?\" Duncan asked. \"You know the Bashar and you have to ask?\" Duncan fell silent, abashed. Tormsa leaned forward and recovered Duncan\u0027s cup. Soon, all evidence of their breakfast lay hidden under the concealing rocks and dirt. That food spoke of careful planning, Duncan thought. He turned and squatted on the cold ground. The mist was still out there beyond the screening bushes. Leafless limbs cut the view into odd bits and pieces. As he watched, the mist began to lift, revealing the blurred outlines of a city at the far edge of the valley. Tormsa squatted beside him. \"Very old city,\" he said. \"Harkonnen place. Look.\" He passed a small monoscope to Duncan. \"That is where we go tonight.\" Duncan put the monoscope to his left eye and tried to focus the oil lens. The controls felt unfamiliar, not at all like those he had learned as a pre-ghola youth or had been taught at the Keep. He removed it from his eye and examined it. \"Ixian?\" he asked. \"No. We made it.\" Tormsa reached over and pointed out two tiny buttons raised above the black tube. \"Slow, fast. Push left to cycle out, right to cycle back.\" Again, Duncan lifted the scope to his eye. Who were the we who had made this thing? A touch of the fast button and the view leaped into his gaze. Tiny dots moved in the city. People! He increased the amplification. The people became small dolls. With them to give him scale, Duncan realized that the city at the valley\u0027s edge was immense... and farther away than he had thought. A single rectangular structure stood in the center of the city, its top lost in the clouds. Gigantic. Duncan knew this place now. The surroundings had changed but that central structure lay fixed in his memory. How many of us vanished into that black hellhole and never returned? \"Nine hundred and fifty stories,\" Tormsa said, seeing where Duncan\u0027s gaze was directed. \"Forty-five kilometers long, thirty kilometers wide. Plasteel and armor-plaz, all of it.\" \"I know.\" Duncan lowered the scope and returned it to Tormsa. \"It was called Barony.\" \"Ysai,\" Tormsa said. \"That\u0027s what they call it now,\" Duncan said. \"I have some different names for it.\" Duncan took a deep breath to put down the old hatreds. Those people were all dead. Only the building remained. And the memories. He scanned the city around that enormous structure. The place was a sprawling mass of warrens. Green spaces lay scattered throughout, each of them behind high walls. Single residences with private parks, Teg had said. The monoscope had revealed guards walking the wall tops. Tormsa spat on the ground in front of him. \"Harkonnen place.\" \"They built to make people feel small,\" Duncan said. Tormsa nodded. \"Small, no power in you.\" The guide had become almost loquacious, Duncan thought. Occasionally during the night, Duncan had defied the order for silence and tried to make conversation. \"What animals made these passages?\" It had seemed a logical question for people trotting along an obvious animal track, even the musty smell of beasts in it. \"Do not talk!\" Tormsa snapped. Later, Duncan asked why they could not get a vehicle of some sort and escape in that. Even a groundcar would be preferable to this painful march across country where one route felt much like another. Tormsa stopped them in a patch of moonlight and looked at Duncan as though he suspected his charge had suddenly become bereft of sense. \"Vehicles can follow!\" \"No one can follow us when we\u0027re on foot?\" \"Followers also must be on foot. Here, they will be killed. They know.\" What a weird place! What a primitive place. In the shelter of the Bene Gesserit Keep, Duncan had not realized the nature of the planet around him. Later, in the no-globe, he had been removed from contact with the outside. He had pre-ghola and ghola memories, but how inadequate those were! When he thought about it now, he realized there had been clues. It was obvious that Gammu possessed rudimentary weather control. And Teg had said that the orbiting monitors that guarded the planet from attack were of the best. Everything for protection, damned little for comfort! It was like Arrakis in that respect. Rakis, he corrected himself. Teg. Did the old man survive? A captive? What did it mean to be captured here in this age? It had meant brutal slavery in the old Harkonnen days. Burzmali and Lucilla... He glanced at Tormsa. \"Will we find Burzmali and Lucilla in the city?\" \"If they get through.\" Duncan glanced down at his clothing. Was it a sufficient disguise? A Tleilaxu Master and companion? People would think the companion a Face Dancer, of course. Face Dancers were dangerous. The baggy trousers were of some material Duncan had never before seen. It felt like wool to the hand, but he sensed that it was artificial. When he spat on it, spittle did not adhere and the smell was not of wool. His fingers detected a uniformity of texture that no natural material could present. The long soft boots and watchcap were of the same fabric. The garments were loose and puffy except at the ankles. Not quilted, though. Insulated by some trick of manufacture that trapped dead air between the layers. The color was a mottled green and gray - excellent camouflage here. Tormsa was dressed in similar garments. \"How long do we wait here?\" Duncan asked. Tormsa shook his head for silence. The guide was seated now, knees up, arms wrapped around his legs, head cradled against his knees, eyes looking outward over the valley. During the night\u0027s trip, Duncan had found the clothing remarkably comfortable. Except for that once in the water, his feet stayed warm but not too warm. There was plenty of room in trousers, shirt, and jacket for his body to move easily. Nothing abraded his flesh. \"Who makes clothing such as this?\" Duncan asked. \"We made it,\" Tormsa growled. \"Be silent.\" This was no different than the pre-awakening days at the Sisterhood\u0027s Keep, Duncan thought. Tormsa was saying: \"No need for you to know.\" Presently, Tormsa stretched out his legs and straightened. He appeared to relax. He glanced at Duncan. \"Friends in the city signal that there are searchers overhead.\" \" \u0027Thopters?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then what do we do?\" \"You must do what I do and nothing else.\" \"You\u0027re just sitting there.\" \"For now. We will go down into the valley soon.\" \"But how -\" \"When you traverse such country as this you become one of the animals that live here. Look at the tracks and see how they walk and how they lie down for a rest.\" \"But can\u0027t the searchers tell the difference between...\" \"If the animals browse, you make the motions of browsing. If searchers come, you continue to do what it was you were doing, what any animal would do. Searchers will be high in the air. That is lucky for us. They cannot tell animal from human unless they come down.\" \"But won\u0027t they -\" \"They trust their machines and the motions they see. They are lazy. They fly high. That way, the search goes faster. They trust their own intelligence to read their instruments and tell which is animal and which is human.\" \"So they\u0027ll just go by us if they think we\u0027re wild animals.\" \"If they doubt, they will scan us a second time. We must not change the pattern of movements after being scanned.\" It was a long speech for the usually taciturn Tormsa. He studied Duncan carefully now. \"You understand?\" \"How will I know when we\u0027re being scanned?\" \"Your gut will tingle. You will feel in your stomach the fizz of a drink that no man should swallow.\" Duncan nodded. \"Ixian scanners.\" \"Let it not alarm you,\" Tormsa said. \"Animals here are accustomed to it. Sometimes, they may pause, but only for an instant and then they go on as if nothing has happened. Which, for them, is true. It is only for us that something evil may happen.\" Presently, Tormsa stood. \"We will go down into the valley now. Follow closely. Do exactly what I do and nothing else.\" Duncan fell into step behind his guide. Soon, they were under the covering trees. Sometime during the night\u0027s passage, Duncan realized, he had begun to accept his place in the schemes of others. A new patience was taking over his awareness. And there was excitement goaded by curiosity. What kind of a universe had come out of the Atreides times? Gammu. What a strange place Giedi Prime had become. Slowly but distinctly, things were being revealed and each new thing opened a view to more that could be learned. He could feel patterns taking shape. One day, he thought, there would be a single pattern and then he would know why they had brought him back from the dead. Yes, it was a matter of opening doors, he thought. You opened one door and that let you into a place where there were other doors. You chose a door in this new place and examined what that revealed to you. There might be times when you were forced to try all of the doors but the more doors you opened, the more certain you became of which door to open next. Finally, a door would open into a place you recognized. Then you could say: \"Ahhhh, this explains everything.\" \"Searchers come,\" Tormsa said. \"We are browsing animals now.\" He reached up to a screening bush and tore down a small limb. Duncan did the same. \"I must rule with eye and claw - as the hawk among lesser birds.\" -Atreides assertion (Ref: BG Archives) At daybreak, Teg emerged from the concealing windbreaks beside a main road. The road was a wide, flat thoroughfare - beam-hardened and kept bare of plant life. Ten lanes, Teg estimated, suitable for both vehicle and foot traffic. There was mostly foot traffic on it at this hour. He had brushed most of the dust off his clothing and made sure there were no signs of rank on it. His gray hair was not as neat as he usually preferred but he had only his fingers for a comb. Traffic on the road was headed toward the city of Ysai many kilometers across the valley. The morning was cloudless with a light breeze in his face moving toward the sea somewhere far behind him. During the night he had come to a delicate balance with his new awareness. Things flickered in his second vision: knowledge of things around him before those things occurred, awareness of where he must put his foot in the next step. Behind this lay the reactive trigger that he knew could snap him into the blurring responses that flesh should not be able to accommodate. Reason could not explain the thing. He felt that he walked precariously along the cutting edge of a knife. Try as he might, he could not resolve what had happened to him under the T-probe. Was it akin to what a Reverend Mother experienced in the spice agony? But he sensed no accumulation of Other Memories out of his past. He did not think the Sisters could do what he did. The doubled vision that told him what to anticipate from every movement within the range of his senses seemed a new kind of truth. Teg\u0027s Mentat teachers had always assured him there was a form of living-truth not susceptible to proof by the marshaling of ordinary facts. It was carried sometimes in fables and poetry and often went contrary to desires, so he had been told. \"The most difficult experience for a Mentat to accept,\" they said. Teg had always reserved judgment on this pronouncement but now he was forced to accept it. The T-probe had thrust him over a threshold into a new reality. He did not know why he chose this particular moment to emerge from hiding, except that it fitted him into an acceptable flow of human movement. Most of that movement on the road was composed of market gardeners towing panniers of vegetables and fruit. The panniers were supported behind them on cheap suspensors. Awareness of that food sent sharp hunger pains through him but he forced himself to ignore them. With experience of more primitive planets in his long service to the Bene Gesserit, he saw this human activity as little different from that of farmers leading loaded animals. The foot traffic struck him as an odd mixture of ancient and modern - farmers afoot, their produce floating behind them on perfectly ordinary technological devices. Except for the suspensors this scene was very like a similar day in humankind\u0027s most ancient past. A draft animal was a draft animal, even if it came off an assembly line in an Ixian factory. Using his new second vision, Teg chose one of the farmers, a squat, dark-skinned man with heavy features and thickly calloused hands. The man walked with a defiant sense of independence. He towed eight large panniers piled with rough-skinned melons. The smell of them was a mouth-watering agony to Teg as he matched his stride to that of the farmer. Teg strode for a few minutes in silence, then ventured: \"Is this the best road to Ysai?\" \"It is a long way,\" the man said. He had a guttural voice, something cautious in it. Teg glanced back at the loaded panniers. The farmer looked sidelong at Teg. \"We go to a market center. Others take our produce from there to Ysai.\" As they talked, Teg realized the farmer had guided (almost herded) him close to the edge of the road. The man glanced back and jerked his head slightly, nodding forward. Three more farmers came up beside them and closed in around Teg and his companion until tall panniers concealed them from the rest of the traffic. Teg tensed. What were they planning? He sensed no menace, though. His doubled vision detected nothing violent in his immediate vicinity. A heavy vehicle sped past them and on ahead. Teg knew of its passage only by the smell of burned fuel, the wind that shook the panniers, the thrumming of a powerful engine and sudden tension in his companions. The high panniers completely hid the passing vehicle. \"We have been looking for you to protect you, Bashar,\" the farmer beside him said. \"There are many who hunt you but none of them with us along here.\" Teg shot a startled glance at the man. \"We served with you at Renditai,\" the farmer said. Teg swallowed. Renditai? He was a moment recalling it - only a minor skirmish in his long history of conflicts and negotiations. \"I am sorry but I do not know your name,\" Teg said. \"Be glad that you do not know our names. It is better that way.\" \"But I\u0027m grateful.\" \"This is a small repayment, which we are glad to make, Bashar.\" \"I must get to Ysai,\" Teg said. \"It is dangerous there.\" \"It is dangerous everywhere.\" \"We guessed you would go to Ysai. Someone will come soon and you will ride in concealment. Ahhhh, here he comes. We have not seen you here, Bashar. You have not been here.\" One of the other farmers took over the towing of his companion\u0027s load, pulling two strings of panniers while the farmer Teg had chosen hustled Teg under a tow rope and into a dark vehicle. Teg glimpsed shiny plasteel and plaz as the vehicle slowed only briefly for the pickup. The door closed sharply behind him and he found himself on a soft upholstered seat, alone in the back of a groundcar. The car picked up speed and soon was beyond the marching farmers. The windows around Teg had been darkened, giving him a dusky view of the passing scene. The driver was a shaded silhouette. This first chance to relax in warm comfort since his capture almost lured Teg into sleep. He sensed no threats. His body still ached from the demands he had made on it and from the agonies of the T-probe. He told himself, though, that he must stay awake and alert. The driver leaned sideways and spoke over his shoulder without turning: \"They have been hunting for you for two days, Bashar. Some think you already off-planet.\" Two days? The stunner and whatever else they had done to him had left him unconscious for a long time. This only added to his hunger. He tried to make the flesh-embedded chrono play against his vision centers and it only flickered as it had done each time he consulted it since the T-probe. His time sense and all references to it were changed. So some thought he had left Gammu. Teg did not ask who hunted him. Tleilaxu and people from the Scattering had been in that attack and the subsequent torture. Teg glanced around his conveyance. It was one of those beautiful old pre-Scattering groundcars, the marks of the finest Ixian manufacture on it. He had never before ridden in one but he knew about them. Restorers picked them up to renew, rebuild - whatever they did that brought back the ancient sense of quality. Teg had been told that such vehicles often were found abandoned in strange places - in old broken-down buildings, in culverts, locked away in machinery warehouses, in farm fields. Again, his driver leaned slightly sideways and spoke over one shoulder: \"Do you have an address where you wish to be taken in Ysai, Bashar?\" Teg called up his memory of the contact points he had identified on his first tour of Gammu and gave one of these to the man. \"Do you know that place?\" \"It is mostly a meeting and drinking establishment, Bashar. I hear they serve good food, too, but anyone can enter if he has the price.\" Not knowing why he had made that particular choice, Teg said: \"We will chance it.\" He did not think it necessary to tell the driver that there were private dining rooms at the address. The mention of food brought back sharp hunger cramps. Teg\u0027s arms began to tremble and he was several minutes restoring calmness. Last night\u0027s activities had almost drained him, he realized. He sent a searching gaze around the car\u0027s interior, wondering if there might be food or drink concealed here. The car\u0027s restoration had been accomplished with loving care but he saw no hidden compartments. Such cars were not all that rare in some quarters, he knew, but all of them spoke of wealth. Who owned this one? Not the driver, certainly. That one had all the signs of a hired professional. But if a message had been sent to bring this car then others knew of Teg\u0027s location. \"Will we be stopped and searched?\" Teg asked. \"Not this car, Bashar. The Planetary Bank of Gammu owns it.\" Teg absorbed this silently. That bank had been one of his contact points. He had studied key branches carefully on his inspection tour. This memory drew him back into his responsibilities as guardian of the ghola. \"My companions,\" Teg ventured. \"Are they...\" \"Others have that in hand, Bashar. I cannot say.\" \"Can word be taken to...\" \"When it is safe, Bashar.\" \"Of course.\" Teg sank back into the cushions and studied his surroundings. These groundcars had been built with much plaz and almost indestructible plasteel. It was other things that went sour with age - upholstery, headliners, the electronics, the suspensor installations, the ablative liners of the turbofan ducts. And the adhesives deteriorated no matter what you did to preserve them. The restorers had made this one look as though it had just been cranked out of the factory - all subdued glowing in the metals, upholstery that molded itself to him with a faint sound of crinkling. And the smell: that indefinable aroma of newness, a mixture of polish and fine fabrics with just a hint of ozone bite underneath from the smoothly working electronics. Nowhere in it, though, was there the smell of food. \"How long to Ysai?\" Teg asked. \"Another half hour, Bashar. Is there a problem that requires more speed? I don\u0027t want to attract...\" \"I am very hungry.\" The driver glanced left and right. There were no more farmers around them here. The roadway was almost empty except for two heavy transport pods with their tractors holding to the right verge and a large lorry hauling a towering automatic fruit picker. \"It is dangerous to delay for long,\" the driver said. \"But I know a place where I think I can at least get you a quick bowl of soup.\" \"Anything would be welcome. I have not eaten for two days and there has been much activity.\" They came to a crossroads and the driver turned left onto a narrow track through tall, evenly spaced conifers. Presently, he turned onto a one-lane drive through the trees. The low building at the end of this track was built of dark stones and had a blackplaz roof. The windows were narrow and glistened with protective burner nozzles. The driver said: \"Just a minute, sir.\" \u0027He got out and Teg had his first look at the man\u0027s face: extremely thin with a long nose and tiny mouth. The visible tracery of surgical reconstruction laced his cheeks. The eyes glowed silver, obviously artificial. He turned away and went into the house. When he returned, he opened Teg\u0027s door. \"Please be quick, sir. The one inside is heating soup for you. I have said you are a banker. No need to pay.\" The ground was icy crisp underfoot. Teg had to stoop slightly for the doorway. He entered a dark hallway, wood-paneled and with a well-lighted room at the end. The smell of food there drew him like a magnet. His arms were trembling once more. A small table had been set beside a window with a view of an enclosed and covered garden. Bushes heavy with red flowers almost concealed the stone wall that defined the garden. Yellow hotplaz gleamed over the space, bathing it in a summery artificial light. Teg sank gratefully into the single chair at the table. White linen, he saw, with an embossed edge. A single soup spoon. A door creaked at his right and a squat figure entered carrying a bowl from which steam arose. The man hesitated when he saw Teg, then brought the bowl to the table and placed it in front of Teg. Alerted by that hesitation, Teg forced himself to ignore the tempting aroma drifting to his nostrils and concentrated instead on his companion. \"It is good soup, sir. I made it myself.\" An artificial voice. Teg saw the scars at the sides of the jaw. There was the look of an ancient mechanical about this man - an almost neckless head attached to thick shoulders, arms that seemed oddly jointed at both shoulders and elbows, legs that appeared to swing only from the hips. He stood motionless now but he had entered here with a slightly jerking sway that said he was mostly replacement artificials. The look of suffering in his eyes could not be avoided. \"I know I\u0027m not pretty, sir,\" the man rasped. \"I was ruined in the Alajory explosion.\" Teg had no idea what the Alajory explosion might have been but it obviously was presumed he knew. \"Ruined,\" however, was an interesting accusation against Fate. \"I was wondering if I knew you,\" Teg said. \"No one here knows anyone else,\" the man said. \"Eat your soup.\" He pointed upward at the coiled tip of quiescent snooper, the glow of its lights revealing that it read its surroundings and found no poison. \"The food is safe here.\" Teg looked at the dark brown liquid in his bowl. Lumps of solid meat were visible in it. He reached for the spoon. His trembling hand made two attempts before grasping the spoon and even then he sloshed most of the liquid out of the spoon before he could lift it a millimeter. A steadying hand gripped Teg\u0027s wrist and the artificial voice spoke softly in Teg\u0027s ear: \"I do not know what they did to you, Bashar, but no one will harm you here without crossing my dead body.\" \"You know me?\" \"Many would die for you, Bashar. My son lives because of you.\" Teg allowed himself to be helped. It was all he could do to swallow the first spoonful. The liquid was rich, hot and soothing. His hand steadied presently and he nodded to the man to release the wrist. \"More, sir?\" Teg realized then that he had emptied the bowl. It was tempting to say \"yes\" but the driver had said to make haste. \"Thank you, but I must go.\" \"You have not been here,\" the man said. When they were once more back on the main road, Teg sat back against the groundcar\u0027s cushions and reflected on the curious echoing quality of what the ruined man had said. The same words the farmer had used: \"You have not been here.\" It had the feeling of a common response and it said something about changes in Gammu since Teg had surveyed the place. They entered the outskirts of Ysai presently and Teg wondered if he should attempt a disguise. The ruined man had recognized him quickly. \"Where do the Honored Matres hunt for me now?\" Teg asked. \"Everywhere, Bashar. We cannot guarantee your safety but steps are being taken. I will make it known where I have delivered you.\" \"Do they say why they hunt me?\" \"They never explain, Bashar.\" \"How long have they been on Gammu?\" \"Too long, sir. Since I was a child and I was a baltern at Renditai.\" A hundred years at least, Teg thought. Time to gather many forces into their hands... if Taraza\u0027s fears were to be credited. Teg credited them. \"Trust no one those whores can influence,\" Taraza had said. Teg sensed no threat to him in his present position, though. He could only absorb the secrecy that obviously enclosed him now. He did not press for more details. They were well into Ysai and he glimpsed the black bulk of the ancient Harkonnen seat of Barony through occasional gaps between the walls that enclosed the great private residences. The car turned onto a street of small commercial establishments: cheap buildings constructed for the most part of salvaged materials that displayed their origins in poor fits and unmatched colors. Gaudy signs advised that the wares inside were the finest, the repair services better than those elsewhere. It was not that Ysai had deteriorated or even gone to seed, Teg thought. Growth here had been diverted into something worse than ugly. Someone had chosen to make this place repellent. That was the key to most of what he saw in the city. Time had not stopped here, it had retreated. This was no modern city full of bright transport pods and insulated usiform buildings. This was random jumbles, ancient structures joined to ancient structures, some built to individual tastes and some obviously designed with some long-gone necessity in mind. Everything about Ysai was joined in a proximity whose disarray just managed to avoid chaos. What saved it, Teg knew, was the old pattern of thoroughfares along which this hodgepodge had been assembled. Chaos was held at bay, although what pattern there was in the streets conformed to no master plan. Streets met and crossed at odd angles, seldom squared. Seen from the air, the place was a crazy quilt with only the giant black rectangle of ancient Barony to speak of an organizing plan. The rest of it was architectural rebellion. Teg saw suddenly that this place was a lie plastered over with other lies, based on previous lies, and such a mad mixup that they might never dig through to a usable truth. All of Gammu was that way. Where could such insanity have had its beginnings? Was it the Harkonnens\u0027 doing? \"We are here, sir.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-25.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
