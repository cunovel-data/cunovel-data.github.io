{"id":97403,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Looking at Duncan seated across from him, Teg felt his neck hairs rising. There was something eerie about this Harkonnen hideaway, as though the Tyrant himself might have been here. What had happened to the Harkonnens who built it? Teg and Lucilla had found absolutely no clues to why the globe had been abandoned. Neither of them could wander through the no-globe without experiencing an acute sense of history. Teg was constantly confounded by unanswered questions. Lucilla, too, commented on this. \"Where did they go? There\u0027s nothing in my Other Memories to give the slightest clue.\" \"Did the Tyrant lure them out and kill them?\" \"I\u0027m going back to the library. Perhaps today I\u0027ll find something.\" For the first two days of their occupation, the globe had received a careful examination by Lucilla and Teg. A silent and sullen Duncan tagged along as though he feared to be left alone. Each new discovery awed them or shocked them. Twenty-one skeletons preserved in transparent plaz along a wall near the core! Macabre observers of everyone who passed through there to the machinery chambers and the nullentropy bins. Patrin had warned Teg about the skeletons. On one of his first youthful examinations of the globe, Patrin had found records that said the dead ones were the artisans who had built the place, all slain by the Harkonnens to preserve the secret. Altogether, the globe was a remarkable achievement, an enclosure cut out of Time, sealed away from everything external. After all of these millennia, its frictionless machinery still created a mimetic projection that even the most modern instruments could not distinguish from the background of dirt and rock. \"The Sisterhood must acquire this place intact!\" Lucilla kept saying. \"It\u0027s a treasure house! They even kept their family\u0027s breeding records!\" That wasn\u0027t all the Harkonnens had preserved here. Teg kept finding himself repelled by subtle and gross touches on almost everything in the globe. Like that clock! Clothing, instruments for maintaining the environment, for education and pleasure - everything had been marked by that Harkonnen compulsion to flaunt their uncaring sense of superiority to all other people and all other standards. Once more, Teg thought of Patrin as a youth in this place, probably no older than the ghola. What had prompted Patrin to keep it a secret even from his wife of so many years? Patrin had never touched on the reasons for secrecy, but Teg made his own deductions. An unhappy childhood. The need for his own secret place. Friends who were not friends but only people waiting to sneer at him. None of those companions could be permitted to share such a wonder. It was his! This was more than a place of lonely security. It had been Patrin\u0027s private token of victory. \"I spent many happy hours there, Bashar. Everything still works. The records are ancient but excellent once you grasp the dialect. There is much knowledge in the place. But you will understand when you get there. You will understand many things I have never told you.\" The antique practice floor showed signs of Patrin\u0027s frequent usage. He had changed the weapons coding on some of the automata in a way Teg recognized. The time-counters told of muscle-torturing hours at the complicated exercises. This globe explained those abilities which Teg had always found so remarkable in Patrin. Natural talents had been honed here. The automata of the no-globe were another matter. Most of them represented defiance of the ancient proscriptions against such devices. More than that, some had been designed for pleasure functions that confirmed the more revolting stories Teg had heard about the Harkonnens. Pain as pleasure! In its own way, these things explained the primly unbending morality that Patrin had taken away from Gammu. Revulsion created its own patterns. Duncan took a deep swallow of his drink and looked at Teg over the lip of the cup. \"Why did you come down here alone when I asked you to complete that last round of exercises?\" Teg asked. \"The exercises made no sense.\" Duncan put down his cup. Well, Taraza, you were wrong, Teg thought. He has struck out for complete independence sooner than you predicted. Also, Duncan had stopped addressing his Bashar as \"sir.\" \"You disobey me?\" \"Not exactly.\" \"Then exactly what is it you\u0027re doing?\" \"I have to know!\" \"You won\u0027t like me very much when you do know.\" Duncan looked startled. \"Sir?\" Ahhhh, the \"sir\" is back! \"I have been preparing you for certain kinds of very intense pain,\" Teg said. \"It is necessary before we can restore your original memories.\" \"Pain, sir?\" \"We know of no other way to bring back the original Duncan Idaho - the one who died.\" \"Sir, if you can do that, I will be nothing but grateful.\" \"So you say. But you may very well see me then as just one more whip in the hands of those who have recalled you to life.\" \"Isn\u0027t it better to know, sir?\" Teg passed the back of a hand across his mouth. \"If you hate me... can\u0027t say I\u0027d blame you.\" \"Sir, if you were in my place, is that how you would feel?\" Duncan\u0027s posture, tone of voice, facial expression - all showed trembling confusion. So far so good, Teg thought. The procedural steps were laid out with a precision that demanded that every response from the ghola be interpreted with care. Duncan was now filled with uncertainty. He wanted something and he feared that thing. \"I\u0027m only your teacher, not your father!\" Teg said. Duncan recoiled at the harsh tone. \"Aren\u0027t you my friend?\" \"That\u0027s a two-way street. The original Duncan Idaho will have to answer that for himself.\" A veiled look entered Duncan\u0027s eyes. \"Will I remember this place, the Keep, Schwangyu and...\" \"Everything. You\u0027ll undergo a kind of double-vision memory for a time, but you\u0027ll remember it all.\" A cynical look came over the young face and, when he spoke, it was with bitterness. \"So you and I will become comrades.\" All of a Bashar\u0027s command and presence in his voice, Teg followed the reawakening instructions precisely. \"I\u0027m not particularly interested in becoming your comrade.\" He fixed a searching glare on Duncan\u0027s face. \"You might make Bashar someday. I think it possible you have the right stuff. But I\u0027ll be long dead by then.\" \"You\u0027re only comrades with Bashars?\" \"Patrin was my comrade and he never rose above squad leader.\" Duncan looked into his empty cup and then at Teg. \"Why didn\u0027t you order something to drink? You worked hard up there, too.\" Perceptive question. It did not do to underestimate this youth. He knew that food sharing was one of the most ancient rituals of association. \"The smell of yours was enough,\" Teg said. \"Old memories. I don\u0027t need them right now.\" \"Then why did you come down here?\" There it was, revealed in the young voice - hope and fear. He wanted Teg to say a particular thing. \"I wanted to take a careful measurement of how far those exercises have carried you,\" Teg said. \"I needed to come down here and look at you.\" \"Why so careful?\" Hope and fear! It was time for the precise shift of focus. \"I\u0027ve never trained a ghola before.\" Ghola. The word lay suspended between them, hanging on the cooking smells that the globe\u0027s filters had not scrubbed from the air. Ghola! It was laced with spice pungency from Duncan\u0027s empty cup. Duncan leaned forward without speaking, his expression eager. Lucilla\u0027s observation came into Teg\u0027s mind: \"He knows how to use silence.\" When it became obvious that Teg would not expand on that simple statement, Duncan sank back with a disappointed look. The left corner of his mouth turned downward, a sullen, festering expression. Everything focused inward the way it had to be. \"You did not come down here to be alone,\" Teg said. \"You came here to hide. You\u0027re still hiding in there and you think no one will ever find you.\" Duncan put a hand in front of his mouth. It was a signal gesture for which Teg had been waiting. The instructions for this moment were clear: \"The ghola wants the original memories wakened and fears this utterly. That is the major barrier you must sunder.\" \"Take your hand away from your mouth!\" Teg ordered. Duncan dropped his hand as though it had been burned. He stared at Teg like a trapped animal. \"Speak the truth,\" Teg\u0027s instructions warned. \"At this moment, every sense afire, the ghola will see into your heart.\" \"I want you to know,\" Teg said, \"that what the Sisterhood has ordered me to do to you, that this is distasteful to me.\" Duncan appeared to crouch into himself. \"What did they order you to do?\" \"The skills I was ordered to give you are flawed.\" \"F-flawed?\" \"Part of it was comprehensive training, the intellectual part. In that respect, you have been brought to the level of regimental commander.\" \"Better than Patrin?\" \"Why must you be better than Patrin?\" \"Wasn\u0027t he your comrade?\" \"Yes.\" \"You said he never rose above squad leader!\" \"Patrin was fully capable of taking over command of an entire multi-planet force. He was a tactical magician whose wisdom I employed on many occasions.\" \"But you said he never -\" \"It was his choice. The low rank gave him the common touch that we both found useful many times.\" \"Regimental commander?\" Duncan\u0027s voice was little more than a whisper. He stared at the tabletop. \"You have an intellectual grasp of the functions, a bit impetuous but experience usually smooths that out. Your weapons skills are superior for your age.\" Still not looking at Teg, Duncan asked: \"What is my age... sir?\" Just as the instructions cautioned: The ghola will dance all around the central issue. \"What is my age?\" How old is a ghola. His voice coldly accusing, Teg said: \"If you want to know your ghola-age, why don\u0027t you ask that?\" \"Wha... what is that age, sir?\" There was such a weight of misery in the youthful voice that Teg felt tears start in the corners of his eyes. He had been warned about this, too. \"Do not reveal too much compassion!\" Teg covered the moment by clearing his throat. He said: \"That\u0027s a question only you can answer.\" The instructions were explicit: \"Turn it back on him! Keep him focused inward. Emotional pain is as important to this process as the physical pain.\" A deep sigh shuddered through Duncan. He closed his eyes tightly. When Teg had first seated himself at the table, Duncan had thought: Is this the moment? Will he do it now? But Teg\u0027s accusing tone, the verbal attacks, were completely unexpected. And now Teg sounded patronizing. He\u0027s patronizing me! Cynical anger surged into Duncan. Did Teg think him such a fool that he could be taken in by the most common ploy of a commander? Tone of voice and attitude alone can subjugate another\u0027s will. Duncan sensed something else in the patronizing, though: a core of plasteel that would not be penetrated. Integrity... purpose. And Duncan had seen the tears start, the covering gesture. Opening his eyes and looking directly at Teg, Duncan said: \"I don\u0027t mean to be disrespectful or ungrateful or rude, sir. But I can\u0027t go on without answers.\" Teg\u0027s instructions were clear: \"You will know when the ghola reaches the point of desperation. No ghola will try to hide this. It is intrinsic to their psyche. You will recognize it in voice and posture.\" Duncan had almost reached the critical point. Silence was mandatory for Teg now. Force Duncan to ask his questions, to take his own course. Duncan said: \"Did you know that I once thought of killing Schwangyu?\" Teg opened his mouth and closed it without a sound. Silence! But the lad was serious! \"I was afraid of her,\" Duncan said. \"I don\u0027t like being afraid.\" He lowered his gaze. \"You once told me that we only hate what\u0027s really dangerous to us.\" \"He will approach it and retreat, approach and retreat. Wait until he plunges.\" \"I don\u0027t hate you,\" Duncan said, looking once more at Teg. \"I resented it when you said ghola to my face. But Lucilla\u0027s right: We should never resent the truth even when it hurts.\" Teg rubbed his own lips. The desire to speak filled him but it was not yet plunge time. \"Doesn\u0027t it surprise you that I considered killing Schwangyu?\" Duncan asked. Teg held himself rigid. Even the shaking of his head would be taken as a response. \"I thought of slipping something into her drink,\" Duncan said. \"But that\u0027s a coward\u0027s way and I\u0027m not a coward. Whatever else, I\u0027m not that.\" Teg remained silently immobile. \"I think you really care what happens to me, Bashar,\" Duncan said. \"But you\u0027re right: we will never be comrades. If I survive, I will surpass you. Then... it will be too late for us to be comrades. You spoke the truth.\" Teg was unable to prevent himself from inhaling a deep breath of Mentat realization: no avoiding the signs of strength in the ghola. Somewhere recently, perhaps in this very alcove just now, the youth had ceased being a youth and had become a man. The realization saddened Teg. It went so fast! No normal growing-up in between. \"Lucilla does not really care what happens to me the way you do,\" Duncan said. \"She\u0027s just following her orders from that Mother Superior, Taraza.\" Not yet! Teg cautioned himself. He wet his lips with his tongue. \"You have been obstructing Lucilla\u0027s orders,\" Duncan said. \"What is it she\u0027s supposed to do to me?\" The moment had come. \"What do you think she\u0027s supposed to do?\" Teg demanded. \"I don\u0027t know!\" \"The original Duncan Idaho would know.\" \"You know! Why won\u0027t you tell me?\" \"I\u0027m only supposed to help restore your original memories.\" \"Then do it!\" \"Only you can really do it.\" \"I don\u0027t know how!\" Teg sat forward on the edge of his chair, but did not speak. Plunge point? He sensed something lacking in Duncan\u0027s desperation. \"You know I can read lips, sir,\" Duncan said. \"Once I went up to the tower observatory. I saw Lucilla and Schwangyu down below talking. Schwangyu said: \u0027Never mind that he\u0027s so young! You\u0027ve had your orders.\u0027 \" Once more cautiously silent, Teg stared back at Duncan. It was like Duncan to move around secretly in the Keep, spying, seeking knowledge. And he had seated himself in that memory-mode now, not realizing that he still was spying and seeking... but in a different way. \"I didn\u0027t think she was supposed to kill me,\" Duncan said. \"But you know what she was supposed to do because you\u0027ve been obstructing her.\" Duncan pounded a fist on the table. \"Answer me, damn you!\" Ahhhh, full desperation! \"I can only tell you that what she intends conflicts with my orders. I was commanded by Taraza herself to strengthen you and guard you from harm.\" \"But you said my training was... was flawed!\" \"Necessary. It was done to prepare you for your original memories.\" \"What am I supposed to do?\" \"You already know.\" \"I don\u0027t, I tell you! Please teach me!\" \"You do many things without having been taught them. Did we teach you disobedience?\" \"Please help me!\" It was a desperate wail. Teg forced himself to chilly remoteness. \"What in the nether hell do you think I\u0027m doing?\" Duncan clenched both fists and pounded them on the table, making his cup dance. He glared at Teg. Abruptly, an odd expression came over Duncan\u0027s face - something grasping in his eyes. \"Who are you?\" Duncan whispered. The key question! Teg\u0027s voice was a lash striking out at a suddenly defenseless victim: \"Who do you think I am?\" A look of utter desperation twisted Duncan\u0027s features. He managed only a gasping stutter: \"You\u0027re... you\u0027re...\" \"Duncan! Stop this nonsense!\" Teg jumped to his feet and stared down with assumed rage. \"You\u0027re...\" Teg\u0027s right hand shot out in a swift arc. The open palm cracked against Duncan\u0027s cheek. \"How dare you disobey me?\" Left hand out, another rocking slap. \"How dare you?\" Duncan reacted so swiftly that Teg experienced an electric instant of absolute shock. Such speed! Although there were separate elements in Duncan\u0027s attack, it occurred in one fluid blur: a leap upward, both feet on the chair, rocking the chair, using that motion to slash the right arm down at Teg\u0027s vulnerable shoulder nerves. Responding out of trained instincts, Teg dodged sideways and flailed his left leg over the table into Duncan\u0027s groin. Teg still did not completely escape. The heel of Duncan\u0027s hand continued downward to strike beside the knee of Teg\u0027s flailing leg. It numbed the whole leg. Duncan sprawled across the tabletop, trying to slide backward in spite of the disabling kick. Teg supported himself, left hand on table, and chopped with the other hand to the base of Duncan\u0027s spine, into the nexus deliberately weakened by the exercises of the past few days. Duncan groaned as paralyzing agony shot through his body. Another person would have been immobilized, screaming, but Duncan merely groaned as he clawed toward Teg, continuing the attack. Relentless in the necessities of the moment, Teg proceeded to create greater pain in his victim, making sure each time that Duncan saw the attacker\u0027s face at the instant of greatest agony. \"Watch his eyes.\" the instructions warned. And Bellonda, reinforcing the procedure, had cautioned: \"His eyes will seem to look through you but he will call you Leto.\" Much later, Teg found difficulty in recalling each detail of his obedience to the reawakening procedure. He knew that he continued to function as commanded but his memory went elsewhere, leaving the flesh free to carry out his orders. Oddly, his trick memory fastened onto another act of disobedience: the Cerbol Revolt, himself at middle age but already a Bashar with a formidable reputation. He had donned his best uniform without its medals (a subtle touch, that) and had presented himself in the scorching noon heat of Cerbol\u0027s battle-plowed fields. Completely unarmed in the path of the advancing rebels! Many among the attackers owed him their lives. Most of them had once given him their deepest allegiance. Now, they were in violent disobedience. And Teg\u0027s presence in their path said to those advancing soldiers: \"I will not wear the medals that tell what I did for you when we were comrades. I will not be anything that says I am one of you. I wear only the uniform that announces that I am still the Bashar. Kill me if that is how far you will carry your disobedience.\" When most of the attacking force threw down their arms and came forward, some of their commanders bent the knee to their old Bashar and he remonstrated: \"You never needed to bow to me or get on your knees! Your new leaders have taught you bad habits.\" Later, he told the rebels he shared some of their grievances. Cerbol had been badly misused. But he also warned them: \"One of the most dangerous things in the universe is an ignorant people with real grievances. That is nowhere near as dangerous, however, as an informed and intelligent society with grievances. The damage that vengeful intelligence can wreak, you cannot even imagine. The Tyrant would seem a benevolent father figure by comparison with what you were about to create!\" It was all true, of course, but in a Bene Gesserit context, and it helped little with what he was commanded to do to the Duncan Idaho ghola - creating mental and physical agony in an almost helpless victim. Easiest to recall was the look in Duncan\u0027s eyes. They did not change focus, but glared directly up into Teg\u0027s face, even at the instant of the final screaming shout: \"Damn you, Leto! What are you doing?\" He called me Leto. Teg limped backward two steps. His left leg tingled and ached where Duncan had struck it. Teg realized that he was panting and at the end of his reserves. He was much too old for such exertions and the things he had just done made him feel dirty. The reawakening procedure was thoroughly fixed in his awareness, though. He knew that gholas once had been awakened by conditioning them unconsciously to attempt murder on someone they loved. The ghola psyche, shattered and forced to reassemble, was always psychologically scarred. This new technique left the scars in the one who managed the process. Slowly, moving against the outcry of muscles and nerves that had been stunned by agony, Duncan slid backward off the table and stood leaning against his chair, trembling and glaring at Teg. Teg\u0027s instructions said: \"You must stand very quietly. Do not move. Let him look at you as he will.\" Teg stood unmoving as he had been instructed. Memory of the Cerbol Revolt left his mind: He knew what he had done then and now. In a way, the two times were similar. He had told the rebels no ultimate truths (if such existed); only enough to lure them back into the fold. Pain and its predictable consequences. \"This is for your own good.\" Was it really good, what they did to this Duncan Idaho ghola? Teg wondered what was occurring in Duncan\u0027s consciousness. Teg had been told as much as was known about these moments, but he could see that the words were inadequate. Duncan\u0027s eyes and face gave abundant evidence of internal turmoil - a hideous twisting of mouth and cheeks, the gaze darting this way and that. Slowly, exquisite in its slowness, Duncan\u0027s face relaxed. His body continued to tremble. He felt the throbbing of his body as a distant thing, aches and darting pains that had happened to someone else. He was here, though, in this immediate moment - whatever and wherever this was. His memories would not mesh. He felt suddenly out of place in flesh too young, not fitted to his pre-ghola existence. The darting and twisting of awareness was all internal now. Teg\u0027s instructors had said: \"He will have ghola-imposed filters on his pre-ghola memories. Some of the original memories will come flooding back. Other recollections will return more slowly. There will be no meshing, though, until he recalls that original moment of death.\" Bellonda had then given Teg the known details of that fatal moment. \"Sardaukar,\" Duncan whispered. He looked around him at the Harkonnen symbols that permeated the no-globe. \"The Emperor\u0027s crack troops wearing Harkonnen uniforms!\" A wolfish grin twisted his mouth. \"How they must have hated that!\" Teg remained silently watchful. \"They killed me,\" Duncan said. It was a flatly unemotional statement, all the more chilling for its positive delivery. A violent shudder passed through him and the trembling subsided. \"At least a dozen of them in that little room.\" He looked directly at Teg. \"One of them got through at me like a meat cleaver right down on my head.\" He hesitated, his throat working convulsively. His gaze remained on Teg. \"Did I buy Paul enough time to escape?\" \"Answer all of his questions truthfully.\" \"He escaped.\" Now, they came to a testing moment. Where had the Tleilaxu acquired the Idaho cells? The Sisterhood\u0027s tests said they were original, but suspicions remained. The Tleilaxu had done something of their own to this ghola. His memories could be a valuable clue to that thing. \"But the Harkonnens...\" Duncan said. His memories from the Keep meshed. \"Oh, yes. Oh, yes!\" A fierce laugh shook him. He sent a roaring victory shout at the long-dead Baron Vladimir Harkonnen: \"I paid you back, Baron! Oh, I did it to you for all of the ones you destroyed!\" \"You remember the Keep and the things we taught you?\" Teg asked. A puzzled frown drew deep crease lines across Duncan\u0027s forehead. Emotional pain warred with his physical pains. He nodded in response to Teg\u0027s question. There were two lives, one that had been walled off behind the axlotl tanks and another... another... Duncan felt incomplete. Something remained suppressed within him. The reawakening was not finished. He stared angrily at Teg. Was there more? Teg had been brutal. Necessary brutality? Was this how you had to restore a ghola? \"I...\" Duncan shook his head from side to side like a great wounded animal in front of the hunter. \"Do you have all of your memories?\" Teg insisted. \"All? Oh, yes. I remember Gammu when it was Giedi Prime - the oil-soaked, blood-soaked hell hole of the Imperium! Yes, indeed, Bashar. I was your dutiful student. Regimental commander!\" Again, he laughed, throwing his head back in an oddly adult gesture for that young body. Teg experienced the sudden release of a deep satisfaction, far deeper than relief. It had worked as they said it would. \"Do you hate me?\" he asked. \"Hate you? Didn\u0027t I tell you I would be grateful?\" Abruptly, Duncan lifted his hands and peered at them. He shifted his gaze downward at his youthful body. \"What a temptation!\" he muttered. He dropped his hands and focused on Teg\u0027s face, tracing the lines of identity. \"Atreides,\" he said. \"You\u0027re all so damned alike!\" \"Not all,\" Teg said. \"I\u0027m not talking about appearance, Bashar.\" His eyes went out of focus. \"I asked my age.\" There was a long silence, then: \"Gods of the deep! So much time has passed!\" Teg said what he had been instructed to say: \"The Sisterhood has need of you.\" \"In this immature body? What am I supposed to do?\" \"Truly, I don\u0027t know, Duncan. The body will mature and I presume a Reverend Mother will explain matters to you.\" \"Lucilla?\" Abruptly, Duncan looked up at the ornate ceiling, then at the alcove and its baroque clock. He remembered coming here with Teg and Lucilla. This place was the same but it was different. \"Harkonnens,\" he whispered. He sent a glowering look at Teg. \"Do you know how many of my family the Harkonnens tortured and killed?\" \"One of Taraza\u0027s Archivists gave me a report.\" \"A report? You think words can tell it?\" \"No. But that was the only answer I had to your question.\" \"Damn you, Bashar! Why do you Atreides always have to be so truthful and honorable?\" \"I think it\u0027s bred into us.\" \"That\u0027s quite right.\" The voice was Lucilla\u0027s and came from behind Teg. Teg did not turn. How much had she heard? How long had she been there? Lucilla came up to stand beside Teg but her attention was on Duncan. \"I see that you\u0027ve done it, Miles.\" \"Taraza\u0027s orders to the letter,\" Teg said. \"You have been very clever, Miles,\" she said. \"Much more clever than I suspected you could be. That mother of yours should have been severely punished for what she taught you.\" \"Ahhhh, Lucilla the seductress,\" Duncan said. He glanced at Teg and returned his attention to Lucilla. \"Yes, now I can answer my other question - what she\u0027s supposed to do.\" \"They\u0027re called Imprinters,\" Teg said. \"Miles,\" Lucilla said, \"if you have complicated my task in ways that prevent me from carrying out my orders, I will have you roasted on a skewer.\" The emotionless quality of her voice sent a shudder through Teg. He knew her threat was a metaphor, but the implications in the threat were real. \"A punishment banquet!\" Duncan said. \"How nice.\" Teg addressed himself to Duncan: \"There\u0027s nothing romantic about what we\u0027ve done to you, Duncan. I\u0027ve assisted the Bene Gesserit in more than one assignment that left me feeling dirty, but never dirtier than this one.\" \"Silence!\" Lucilla ordered. The full force of Voice was in the command. Teg let it flow through him and past him as his mother had taught, then: \"Those of us who give our true loyalty to the Sisterhood have only one concern: survival of the Bene Gesserit. Not survival of any individual but of the Sisterhood itself. Deceptions, dishonesties - those are empty words when the question is the Sisterhood\u0027s survival.\" \"Damn that mother of yours, Miles!\" Lucilla paid him the compliment of not hiding her rage. Duncan stared at Lucilla. Who was she? Lucilla? He felt his memories stirring of themselves. Lucilla was not the same person... not the same at all, and yet... bits and pieces were the same. Her voice. Her features. Abruptly, he saw again the face of the woman he had glimpsed on the wall of his room at the Keep. \"Duncan, my sweet Duncan.\" Tears fell from Duncan\u0027s eyes. His own mother - another Harkonnen victim. Tortured... who knew what else? Never seen again by her \"sweet Duncan.\" \"Gods, I wish I had one of them to kill right now,\" Duncan moaned.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-15.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
