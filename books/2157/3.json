{"id":97391,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Who shall guard the guardians? Who shall see that the guardians commit no offenses? This was a question that Teg had considered carefully on many occasions. It formed one of the basic tenets of his loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. Whatever else you might say about the Sisterhood, they displayed an admirable constancy of purpose. Moral purpose, Teg labeled it. The Bene Gesserit moral purpose agreed completely with Teg\u0027s principles. That those principles were Bene Gesserit-conditioned in him did not enter into the question. Rational thought, especially Mentat rationality, could make no other judgment. Teg boiled it down to an essence: If only one person followed such guiding principles, this was a better universe. It was never a question of justice. Justice required one to resort to law and that could be a fickle mistress, subject always to the whims and prejudices of those who administered the laws. No, it was a question of fairness, a concept that went much deeper. The people upon whom judgment was passed must feel the fairness of it. To Teg, statements such as \"the letter of the law must be observed\" were dangerous to his guiding principles. Being fair required agreement, predictable constancy and, above all else, loyalty upward and downward in the hierarchy. Leadership guided by such principles required no outside controls. You did your duty because it was right. And you did not obey because that was predictably correct. You did it because the rightness was a thing of this moment. Prediction and prescience had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Teg knew the Atreides reputation for reliable prescience, but gnomic utterances had no place in his universe. You took the universe as you found it and applied your principles where you could. Absolute commands in the hierarchy were always obeyed. Not that Taraza had made it a question of absolute command, but the implications were there. \"You are the perfect person for this task.\" He had lived a long life with many high points and he was retired with honor. Teg knew he was old, slow and with all the defects of age waiting just at the edges of his awareness, but the call to duty quickened him even while he was forced to put down the wish to say \"No.\" The assignment had come from Taraza personally. The powerful senior of all (including the Missionaria Protectiva) singled him out. Not just a Reverend Mother but the Reverend Mother Superior. Taraza came to his retirement sanctuary on Lernaeus. It honored him for her to do this and he knew it. She appeared at his gate unannounced accompanied only by two acolyte servers and a small guard force, some of whose faces he recognized. Teg had trained them himself. The time of her arrival was interesting. Morning, shortly after his breakfast. She knew the patterns of his life and certainly knew that he was most alert at this hour. So she wanted him awake and at his fullest capabilities. Patrin, Teg\u0027s old batman brought Taraza into the east wing sitting room, a small and elegant setting with only solid furniture in it. Teg\u0027s dislike of chairdogs and other living furniture was well known. Patrin had a sour look on his face as he ushered the black-robed Mother Superior into the room. Teg recognized the look immediately. Patrin\u0027s long, pale face with its many age wrinkles might appear an unmoved mask to others, but Teg was alert to the deepened wrinkles beside the man\u0027s mouth, the set stare in the old eyes. So Taraza had said something on the way in here that had disturbed Patrin. Tall sliding doors of heavy plaz framed the room\u0027s eastward view down a long sloping lawn to trees beside the river. Taraza paused just inside the room to admire the view. Without being told, Teg touched a button. Curtains slid across the view and glowglobes came alight. Teg\u0027s action told Taraza he had computed a need for privacy. He emphasized this by ordering Patrin: \"Please see that we are not disturbed.\" \"The orders for the South Farm, sir,\" Patrin ventured. \"Please see to that yourself. You and Firus know what I want.\" Patrin closed the door a little too sharply as he left, a tiny signal but it spoke much to Teg. Taraza moved a pace into the room and examined it. \"Lime green,\" she said. \"One of my favorite colors. Your mother had a fine eye.\" Teg warmed to the remark. He had a deep affection for this building and this land. His family had been here only three generations but their mark was on the place. His mother\u0027s touches had not really been changed in many rooms. \"It\u0027s safe to love land and places,\" Teg said. \"I particularly liked the burnt orange carpets in the hall and the stained glass fanlight over the entry door,\" Taraza said. \"That fanlight is a real antique, I am sure.\" \"You did not come here to talk about interior decoration,\" Teg said. Taraza chuckled. She had a high-pitched voice, which the Sisterhood\u0027s training had taught her to use with devastating effectiveness. It was not a voice easy to ignore, even when she appeared most carefully casual as she did now. Teg had seen her in Bene Gesserit Council. Her manner there was powerful and persuasive, every word an indicator of the incisive mind that guided her decisions. He could sense an important decision beneath her demeanor now. Teg indicated a green upholstered chair at his left. She glanced at it, swept her gaze once more around the room and suppressed a smile. Not a chairdog in the house, she would wager. Teg was an antique surrounding himself with antiques. She seated herself and smoothed her robe while waiting for Teg to take a matching chair facing her. \"I regret the need to ask that you come out of retirement, Bashar, she said. \"Unfortunately, circumstances give me little choice.\" Teg rested his long arms casually on his chair\u0027s arms, a Mentat in repose, waiting. His attitude said: \"Fill my mind with data.\" Taraza was momentarily abashed. This was an imposition. Teg was still a regal figure tall and with that large head topped by gray hair. He was, she knew, four SY short of three hundred. Granting that the Standard Year was some twenty hours less than the so-called primitive year, it was still an impressive age with experiences in Bene Gesserit service that demanded that she respect him. Teg wore, she noted, a light gray uniform with no insignia: carefully tailored trousers and jacket, white shirt open at the throat to reveal a deeply wrinkled neck. There was a glint of gold at his waist and she recognized the Bashar\u0027s sunburst he had received at retirement. How like the utilitarian Teg! He had made the golden bauble into a belt buckle. This reassured her. Teg would understand her problem. \"Could I have a drink of water?\" Taraza asked. \"It has been a long and tiresome journey. We came the last stage by one of our transports, which we should have replaced five hundred years ago.\" Teg lifted himself from the chair, went to a wall panel and removed a chilled water bottle and glass from a cabinet behind the panel. He put these on a low table at Taraza\u0027s right hand. \"I have melange,\" he said. \"No, thank you, Miles. I\u0027ve my own supply.\" Teg resumed his seat and she noted the signs of stiffness. He was still remarkably supple, however, considering his years. Taraza poured herself a half glass of water and drank it in one swallow. She replaced the glass on the side table with elaborate care. How to approach this? Teg\u0027s manner did not fool her. He did not want to leave retirement. Her analysts had warned her about that. Since retirement, he had taken more than a casual interest in farming. His extensive acreage here on Lernaeus was essentially a research garden. She lifted her gaze and studied him openly. Square shoulders accentuated Teg\u0027s narrow waist. He still kept himself active then. That long face with its sharp lines from the strong bones: typically Atreides. Teg returned her gaze as he always did, demanding attention but open to whatever the Mother Superior might say. His thin mouth was cocked into a slight smile, exposing bright and even teeth. He knows I\u0027m uncomfortable, she thought. Damn it! He\u0027s just as much a servant of the Sisterhood as I am! Teg did not prompt her with questions. His manner remained impeccable, curiously withdrawn. She reminded herself that this was a common trait of Mentats and nothing else should be read into it. Abruptly, Teg stood and strode to a sideboard at Taraza\u0027s left. He turned, folded his arms across his breast and leaned there looking down at her. Taraza was forced to swivel her chair to face him. Damn him! Teg was not going to make this any easier for her. All of the Reverend Mother Examiners had remarked a difficulty in getting Teg to sit for conversation. He preferred to stand, his shoulders held with military stiffness, his gaze aimed downward. Few Reverend Mothers matched his height - more than two meters. This trait, the analysts agreed, was Teg\u0027s way (probably unconscious) of protesting the Sisterhood\u0027s authority over him. None of this, however, showed itself in his other behavior. Teg had always been the most reliable military commander the Sisterhood had ever employed. In a multisociety universe whose major binding forces interacted with complexity despite the simplicity of labels, reliable military commanders were worth their weight in melange many times over. Religions and the common memory of imperial tyrannies always figured in the negotiations but it was economic forces that eventually carried the day and the military coin could be entered on anybody\u0027s adding machine. It was there in every negotiation and would be for as long as necessity drove the trading system - the need for particular things (such as spice or the technoproducts of Ix), the need for specialists (such as Mentats or Suk doctors), and all of the other mundane needs for which there were markets: for labor forces, for builders, for designers, for planiformed life, for artists, for exotic pleasures... No legal system could bind such complexity into a whole and this fact quite obviously brought up another necessity - the constant need for arbiters with clout. Reverend Mothers had naturally fallen into this role within the economic web and Miles Teg knew this. He also knew that he was once more being brought out as a bargaining chip. Whether he enjoyed that role did not figure in the negotiations. \"It\u0027s not as though you had any family to hold you here,\" Taraza said. Teg accepted this silently. Yes, his wife had been dead thirty-eight years now. His children were all grown and, with the exception of one daughter, gone from the nest. He had his many personal interests but no family obligations. True. Taraza reminded him then of his long and faithful service to the Sisterhood, citing several memorable achievements. She knew the praise would have little effect on him but it provided her with a needed opening for what must follow. \"You have been apprised of your familial resemblance,\" she said. Teg inclined his head no more than a millimeter. \"Your resemblance to the first Leto Atreides, grandfather of the Tyrant, is truly remarkable,\" she said. Teg gave no sign that he heard or agreed. This was merely a datum, something already stored in his copious memory. He knew he bore Atreides genes. He had seen the likeness of Leto I at Chapter House. It had been oddly like looking into a mirror. \"You\u0027re a bit taller,\" Taraza said. Teg continued to stare down at her. \"Damn it all, Bashar,\" Taraza said, \"will you at least try to help me?\" \"Is that an order, Mother Superior?\" \"No, it\u0027s not an order!\" Teg smiled slowly. The fact that Taraza allowed herself such an explosion in front of him said many things. She would not do that with people she felt were untrustworthy. And she certainly would not permit herself such an emotional display with a person she considered merely an underling. Taraza sat back in her chair and grinned up at him. \"All right,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve had your fun. Patrin said you would be most upset with me if I called you back to duty. I assure you that you are crucial to our plans.\" \"What plans, Mother Superior?\" \"We are raising a Duncan Idaho ghola on Gammu. He is almost six years old and ready for military education.\" Teg allowed his eyes to widen slightly. \"It will be a taxing duty for you,\" Taraza said, \"but I want you to take over his training and protection as soon as possible.\" \"My likeness to the Atreides Duke,\" Teg said. \"You will use me to restore his original memories.\" \"In eight or ten years, yes.\" \"That long!\" Teg shook his head. \"Why Gammu?\" \"His prana-bindu inheritance has been altered by the Bene Tleilax, at our orders. His reflexes will match in speed those of anyone born in our times. Gammu... the original Duncan Idaho was born and raised there. Because of the changes in his cellular inheritance we must keep all else as close to the original conditions as possible.\" \"Why are you doing this?\" It was a Mentat\u0027s data-conscious tone. \"A female child with the ability to control the worms had been discovered on Rakis. We will have use for our ghola there.\" \"You will breed them?\" \"I am not engaging you as a Mentat. It is your military abilities and your likeness to the original Leto that we need. You know how to restore his original memories when the time comes.\" \"So you\u0027re really bringing me back as a Weapons Master.\" \"You think that\u0027s a comedown for the man who was Supreme Bashar of all our forces?\" \"Mother Superior, you command and I obey. But I will not accept this post without full command of all of Gammu\u0027s defenses.\" \"That already has been arranged, Miles.\" \"You always did know how my mind works.\" \"And I\u0027ve always been confident of your loyalty.\" Teg pushed himself away from the sideboard and stood a moment in thought, then: \"Who will brief me?\" \"Bellonda from Records, the same as before. She will provide you with a cipher to secure the exchange of messages between us.\" \"I will give you a list of people,\" Teg said. \"Old comrades and the children of some of them. I will want all of them waiting on Gammu when I arrive.\" \"You don\u0027t think any of them will refuse?\" His look said: \"Don\u0027t be silly!\" Taraza chuckled and she thought: There\u0027s a thing we learned well from the original Atreides - how to produce people who command the utmost devotion and loyalty. \"Patrin will handle the recruiting,\" Teg said. \"He won\u0027t accept rank I know, but he\u0027s to get the full pay and courtesies of a colonel-aide.\" \"You will, of course, be restored to the rank of Supreme Bashar,\" she said. \"We will...\" \"No. You have Burzmali. We will not weaken him by bringing back his old Commander over him.\" She studied him a moment, then: \"We have not yet commissioned Burzmali as...\" \"I am well aware of that. My old comrades keep me fully informed of Sisterhood politics. But you and I, Mother Superior, know it\u0027s only a matter of time. Burzmali is the best.\" She could only accept this. It was more than a military Mentat\u0027s assessment. It was Teg\u0027s assessment. Another thought struck her. \"Then you already knew about our dispute in Council!\" she accused. \"And you let me...\" \"Mother Superior, if I thought you would produce another monster on Rakis, I would have said so. You trust my decisions; I trust yours.\" \"Damn you, Miles, we\u0027ve been apart too long.\" Taraza stood. \"I feel calmer just knowing you\u0027ll be back in harness.\" \"Harness,\" he said. \"Yes. Reinstate me as a Bashar on special assignment. That way, when word gets back to Burzmali, there\u0027ll be no silly questions.\" Taraza produced a sheaf of ridulian papers from beneath her robe and passed them to Teg. \"I\u0027ve already signed these. Fill in your own reinstatement. The other authorizations are all there, transport vouchers and so on. I give you these orders personally. You are to obey me. You are my Bashar, do you understand?\" \"Wasn\u0027t I always?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s more important than ever now. Keep that ghola safe and train him well. He\u0027s your responsibility. And I will back you in that against anyone.\" \"I hear Schwangyu commands on Gammu.\" \"Against anyone Miles. Don\u0027t trust Schwangyu.\" \"I see. Will you lunch with us? My daughter has...\" \"Forgive me, Miles, but I must get back soonest. I will send Bellonda at once.\" Teg saw her to the door, exchanged a few pleasantries with his old students in her party and watched as they left. They had an armored groundcar waiting in the drive, one of the new models that they obviously had brought with them. Sight of it gave Teg an uneasy feeling. Urgency! Taraza had come in person, the Mother Superior herself on a messenger\u0027s errand, knowing what that would reveal to him. Knowing so intimately how the Sisterhood performed, he saw the revelation in what had just happened. The dispute in the Bene Gesserit Council went far deeper than his informants had suggested. \"You are my Bashar.\" Teg glanced through the sheaf of authorizations and vouchers Taraza had left with him. Already carrying her seal and signature. The trust this implied added to the other things he sensed and increased his disquiet. \"Don\u0027t trust Schwangyu.\" He slipped the papers into his pocket and went in search of Patrin. Patrin would have to be briefed, and mollified. They would have to discuss whom to call in for this assignment. He began to list some of the names in his mind. Dangerous duty ahead. It called for only the best people. Damn! Everything on the estate here would have to be passed over to Firus and Dimela. So many details! He felt his pulse quicken as he strode through the house. Passing a house guard, one of his old soldiers, Teg paused: \"Martin, cancel all of my appointments for today. Find my daughter and tell her to meet me in my study.\" Word spread through the house and, from there, across the estate. Servants and family, knowing that The Reverend Mother Superior had just conversed privately with him, automatically set up a protective screen to keep idle distractions away from Teg. His eldest daughter, Dimela, cut him short when he tried to list details necessary to carry on his experimental farm projects. \"Father, I am not an infant!\" They were in the small greenhouse attached to his study. Remains of Teg\u0027s lunch sat on the corner of a potting bench. Patrin\u0027s notebook was propped against the wall behind, the luncheon tray. Teg looked sharply at his daughter. Dimela favored him in appearance but not in height. Too angular to be a beauty but she had made a good marriage. They had three fine children, Dimela and Firus. \"Where is Firus?\" Teg asked. \"He\u0027s out seeing to the replanting of the South Farm.\" \"Oh, yes. Patrin mentioned that.\" Teg smiled. It had always pleased him that Dimela had refused the Sisterhood\u0027s bid, preferring to marry Firus, a native of Lernaeus, and remain in her father\u0027s entourage. \"All I know is that they\u0027re calling you back to duty,\" Dimela said. \"Is it a dangerous assignment?\" \"You know, you sound exactly like your mother,\" Teg said. \"So it is dangerous! Damn them, haven\u0027t you done enough for them?\" \"Apparently not.\" She turned away from him as Patrin entered the far end of the greenhouse. He heard her speak to Patrin as they passed. \"The older he gets the more he gets like a Reverend Mother himself!\" What else could she expect? Teg wondered. The son of a Reverend Mother, fathered by a minor functionary of the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles, he had matured in a household that moved to the Sisterhood\u0027s beat. It had been apparent to him at an early age that his father\u0027s allegiance to CHOAM\u0027s interplanetary trading network vanished when his mother objected. This house had been his mother\u0027s house until her death less than a year after his father died. The imprint of her choices lay all around him. Patrin stopped in front of him. \"I came back for my notebook. Have you added any names?\" \"A few. You\u0027d better get right on it.\" \"Yes, sir!\" Patrin did a smart about-face and strode back the way he had come, slapping the notebook against his leg. He feels it, too, Teg thought. Once more, Teg glanced around him. This house was still his mother\u0027s place. After all the years he had lived here, raised a family here! Still her place. Oh, he had built this greenhouse, but the study there had been her private room. Janet Roxbrough of the Lernaeus Roxbroughs. The furnishings, the decor, still her place. Taraza had seen that. He and his wife had changed some of the surface objects, but the core remained Janet Roxbrough\u0027s. No question about the Fish Speaker blood in that lineage. What a prize she had been for the Sisterhood! That she had wed Loschy Teg and lived out her life here, that was the oddity. An undigestible fact until you knew how the Sisterhood\u0027s breeding designs worked over the generations. They\u0027ve done it again, Teg thought. They\u0027ve had me waiting in the wings all these years just for this moment. Has not religion claimed a patent on creation for all of these millennia? - The Tleilaxu Question, from Muad\u0027dib Speaks The air of Tleilax was crystalline, gripped by a stillness that was part the morning chill and part a sense of fearful crouching, as though life waited out there in the city of Bandalong, life anticipating and ravenous, which would not stir until it received his personal signal. The Mahai, Tylwyth Waff, Master of the Masters, enjoyed this hour more than any other of the day. The city was his now as he looked out through his open window. Bandalong would come alive only at his command. This was what he told himself. The fear that he could sense out there was his hold on any reality that might arise from that incubating reservoir of life: the Tleilaxu civilization that had originated here and then spread its powers afar. They had waited millennia for this time, his people. Waff savored the moment now. All through the bad times of the Prophet Leto II (not God Emperor but God\u0027s Messenger), all through the Famines and the Scattering, through every painful defeat at the hands of lesser creatures, through all of those agonies the Tleilaxu had built their patient forces for this moment. We have come to our moment, O Prophet! The city that lay beneath his high window he saw as a symbol, one strong mark on the page of Tleilaxu design. Other Tleilaxu planets, other great cities, interlinked, interdependent, and with central allegiance to his God and his city, awaited the signal that all of them knew must come soon. The twinned forces of Face Dancers and Masheikh had compressed their powers in preparation for the cosmic leap. The millennia of waiting were about to end. Waff thought of it as \"the long beginning.\" Yes. He nodded to himself as he looked at the crouching city. From its inception, from that infinitesimal kernel of an idea, Bene Tleilax leaders had understood the perils of a plan so extended, so protracted, so convoluted and subtle. They had known they must surmount near disaster time and again, accept galling losses, submissions and humiliations. All of this and much more had gone into the construction of a particular Bene Tleilax image. By those millennia of pretense they had created a myth. \"The vile, detestable, dirty Tleilaxu! The stupid Tleilaxu! The predictable Tleilaxu! The impetuous Tleilaxu!\" Even the Prophet\u0027s minions had fallen prey to this myth. A captive Fish Speaker had stood in this very room and shouted at a Tleilaxu Master: \"Long pretense creates a reality! You are truly vile!\" So they had killed her and the Prophet did nothing. How little all of those alien worlds and peoples understood Tleilaxu restraint. Impetuosity? Let them reconsider after the Bene Tleilax demonstrated how many millennia they were capable of waiting for their ascendancy. \"Spannungsbogen!\" Waff rolled the ancient word on his tongue: The span of the bow! How far back you draw the bow before releasing your arrow. This arrow would strike deep! \"The Masheikh have waited longer than any other,\" Waff whispered. He dared to utter the word to himself here in his tower fastness: \"Masheikh.\" The rooftops below him glittered as the sun lifted. He could hear the stirrings of the city\u0027s life. The sweet bitterness of Tleilaxu smells drifted on the air coming in his window. Waff inhaled deeply and closed his window. He felt renewed by his moment of solitary observation. Turning away from the window, he donned the white khilat robe of honor to which all Domel were conditioned to bow. The robe completely covered his short body, giving him the distinct feeling that it actually was armor. The armor of God! \"We are the people of the Yaghist,\" he had reminded his councillors only last night. \"All else is frontier. We have fostered the myth of our weakness and evil practices for these millennia with only one purpose. Even the Bene Gesserit believe!\" Seated in the deep, windowless sagra with its no-chamber shield, his nine councillors had smiled in silent appreciation of his words. In the judgment of the ghufran, they knew. The stage upon which the Tleilaxu determined their own destiny had always been the kehl with its right of ghufran. It was proper that even Waff, the most powerful of all Tleilaxu, could not leave his world and be readmitted without abasing himself in the ghufran, begging pardon for contact with the unimaginable sins of aliens. To go out among the powindah could soil even the mightiest. The khasadars who policed all Tleilaxu frontiers and guarded the selamliks of the women were right to suspect even Waff. He was of the people and the kehl, yes, but he must prove it each time he left the heartland and returned, and certainly every time he entered the selamlik for the distribution of his sperm. Waff crossed to his long mirror and inspected himself and his robe. To the powindahs, he knew, he appeared an elfin figure barely a meter and a half tall. Eyes, hair, and skin were shades of gray, all a stage for the oval face with its tiny mouth and line of sharp teeth. A Face Dancer might mimic his features and pose, might dissemble at a Masheikh\u0027s command, but no Masheikh or khasadar would be fooled. Only the powindahs would be gulled. Except for the Bene Gesserit! This thought brought a scowl to his face. Well, the witches had yet to encounter one of the new Face Dancers. No other people have mastered the genetic language as well as have the Bene Tleilax, he reassured himself. We are right to call it \"the language of God,\" for God Himself has given us this great power. Waff strode to his door and waited for the morning bell. There was no way, he thought, to describe the richness of emotion he felt now. Time unfolded for him. He did not ask why the Prophet\u0027s true message had been heard only by the Bene Tleilax. It had been God\u0027s doing and, in that, the Prophet had been the Arm of God, worthy of respect as God\u0027s Messenger. You prepared them for us, O Prophet. And the ghola on Gammu, this ghola at this time, was worth all of the waiting. The morning bell sounded and Waff strode out into the hall, turned with other emerging white-robed figures and went onto the eastern balcony to greet the sun. As the Mahai and Abdl of his people, he now could identify himself with all Tleilaxu. We are the legalists of the Shariat, the last of our kind in the universe. Nowhere outside the sealed chambers of his malik-brothers could he reveal such a secret thought but he knew it was a thought shared in every mind around him now, and the workings of that thought were visible in Masheikh, Domel and Face Dancer alike. The paradox of kinship ties and a sense of social identity that permeated the khel from Masheikh down to the lowliest Domel was not a paradox to Waff. We work for the same God. A Face Dancer in the guise of Domel had bowed and opened the balcony doors. Waff, emerging into sunlight with his many companions close around, smiled at recognition of the Face Dancer. A Domel yet! It was a kin joke but Face Dancers were not kin. They were constructs, tools, just as the ghola on Gammu was a tool, all designed with the language of God spoken only by Masheikhs. With the others who pressed close around him Waff made obeisance to the sun. He uttered the cry of the Abdl and heard it echoed by countless voices from the farthest reaches of the city. \"The sun is not God!\" he shouted. No, the sun was only a symbol of God\u0027s infinite powers and mercy - another construct, another tool. Feeling cleansed by his passage through the ghufran the previous night, renewed by the morning ritual, Waff could think now about the trip outward to powindah places and the return just completed, which had made ghufran necessary. Other worshipers made way for him as he went back to the inner corridors and entered the slide passage that dropped him to the central garden where he had asked his councillors to meet him. It was a successful foray among the powindah, he thought. Every time he left the inner worlds of the Bene Tleilax Waff felt himself to be on lashkar, a war party seeking that ultimate revenge which his people named secretly as Bodal (always capitalized and always the first thing reaffirmed in ghufran or khel). This most recent lashkar had been exquisitely successful. Waff emerged from the slide into a central garden filled with sunlight by prismatic reflectors on the surrounding rooftops. A small fountain played its visual fugue at the heart of a graveled circle. A low fence of white palings at one side enclosed a closely cropped lawn, a space near enough to the fountain that the air would be moist but not so close that the splashing water would intrude on low-voiced conversation. Around the grassy enclosure, ten narrow benches of an ancient plastic were arranged - nine of them in a semicircle facing a tenth bench set slightly apart. Pausing at the edge of the grassy enclosure, Waff glanced around him, wondering why he had never before felt quite this intense pleasure at sight of the place. The dark blue of the benches was intrinsic to the material. Centuries of use had worn the benches into soft curves along the arm rests and where countless bottoms had planted themselves, but the color was just as strong in the worn places as it was elsewhere. Waff sat down facing his nine councillors, marshaling the words he knew he must use. The document he had brought back from his latest lashkar, indeed, the very reason for that excursion, could not have been more exquisitely timed. The label on it and the words carried a mighty message for the Tleilaxu. From an inner pocket Waff removed the thin sheaf of ridulian crystal. He noted the quickened interest of his councillors: nine faces similar to his own, Masheikhs of the innermost kehl. All reflected expectancy. They had read this document in kehl: \"The Atreides Manifesto.\" They had spent a night of reflection on the manifesto\u0027s message. Now, the words must be confronted. Waff placed the document on his lap. \"I propose to spread these words far and wide,\" Waff said. \"Without change?\" That was Mirlat, the councillor closest to ghola-transformation among all of them. Mirlat no doubt aspired to Abdl and Mahai. Waff focused on the councillor\u0027s wide jaws where the cartilage had grown over the centuries as a visible mark of his current body\u0027s great age. \"Exactly as it has come into our hands,\" Waff said. \"Dangerous,\" Mirlat said. Waff turned his head to the right, his childlike profile outlined against the fountain for his councillors to observe. God\u0027s hand is on my right! The sky above him was polished carnelian as though Bandalong, the most ancient city of the Tleilaxu, had been built under one of those gigantic artificial covers erected to protect pioneers on the harsher planets. When he returned his attention to his councillors, Waff\u0027s features remained bland. \"Not dangerous to us,\" he said. \"A matter of opinion,\" Mirlat said. \"Then let us consider opinions,\" Waff said. \"Have we a need to fear Ix or the Fish Speakers? Indeed not. They are ours, although they do not know it.\" Waff let this sink in; all of them knew that new Face Dancers sat in the highest councils of Ix and Fish Speakers, the exchange undetected. \"The Guild will not move against us or oppose us because we are their only secure source of melange,\" Waff said. \"Then what of these Honored Matres returned from the Scattering?\" Mirlat demanded. \"We will deal with them when it is required of us,\" Waff said. \"And we will be helped by the descendants of our own people who voluntarily went out into the Scattering.\" \"The time does appear opportune,\" one of the other councillors murmured. It was Torg the Younger who had spoken, Waff observed. Good. There was a vote secured. \"The Bene Gesserit!\" Mirlat snapped. \"I think the Honored Matres will remove the witches from our path,\" Waff said. \"Already they growl against each other like animals in the fighting pit.\" \"What if the author of that manifesto is identified?\" Mirlat demanded. \"What then?\" Several heads nodded among the councillors. Waff marked them: people to be won over. \"It is dangerous to be called Atreides in this age,\" he said. \"Except perhaps on Gammu,\" Mirlat said. \"And the name Atreides has been signed to that document!\" How odd, Waff thought. The CHOAM representative at the powindah conference that had taken Waff away from the inner planets of Tleilax had emphasized that very point. But most of CHOAM\u0027s people were secret atheists who looked on all religion as suspect, and certainly the Atreides had been a potent religious force. CHOAM worries had been almost palpable. Waff recounted this CHOAM reaction now. \"This CHOAM hireling, damn his Godless soul, is right,\" Mirlat insisted. \"The document\u0027s insidious.\" Mirlat will have to be dealt with, Waff thought. He lifted the manifesto from his lap and read the first line aloud: \"In the beginning was the word and the word was God.\" \"Directly from the Orange Catholic Bible,\" Mirlat said. Once more, heads nodded in worried agreement. Waff showed the points of his canines in a brief smile. \"Do you suggest that there are those among the powindah who suspect the existence of the Shariat and the Masheikhs?\" It felt good to speak these words openly, reminding his listeners that only here among the innermost Tleilaxu were the old words and the old language preserved without change. Did Mirlat or any of the others fear that Atreides words could subvert the Shariat? Waff posed this question, too, and saw the worried frowns.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-3.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
