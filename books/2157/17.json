{"id":97405,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"How moral and how superior?\n According to the records he had seen at the Keep (and Duncan was sure they had been placed there especially for him to discover) Teg\u0027s reputation was an almost universal thing throughout human society of this age. At the Battle of Markon, it had been enough for the enemy to know that Teg was there opposite them in person. They sued for terms. Was that true?\n Duncan looked at Teg in the console cage and put this question to him.\n \"Reputation can be a beautiful weapon,\" Teg said. \"It often spills less blood.\"\n \"At Arbelough, why did you go to the front with your troops?\" Duncan asked.\n Teg showed surprise. \"Where did you learn that?\"\n \"At the Keep. You might have been killed. What would that have served?\"\n Teg reminded himself that this young flesh standing over him held unknown knowledge, which must guide Duncan\u0027s quest for information. It was in that unknown area, Teg suspected, that Duncan was most valuable to the Sisterhood.\n \"We took severe losses at Arbelough on the preceding two days,\" Teg said. \"I failed to make a correct assessment of the enemy\u0027s fear and fanaticism.\"\n \"But the risk of...\"\n \"My presence at the front said to my own people: \u0027I share your risks.\u0027 \"\n \"The Keep\u0027s records said Arbelough had been perverted by Face Dancers. Patrin told me you vetoed your aides when they urged you to sweep the planet clean, sterilize it and -\"\n \"You were not there, Duncan.\"\n \"I am trying to be. So you spared your enemy against all advice.\"\n \"Except for the Face Dancers.\"\n \"But then you walked unarmed through the enemy ranks and before they had laid down their weapons.\"\n \"To assure them they would not be mistreated.\"\n \"That was very dangerous.\"\n \"Was it? Many of them came over to us for the final assault on Kroinin where we broke the anti-Sisterhood forces.\"\n Duncan stared hard at Teg. Not only did this old Bashar resemble Duke Leto in appearance, but he also had that same Atreides charisma: a legendary figure even among his former enemies. Teg had said he was descended from Ghanima of the Atreides, but there had to be more in it than that. The ways of the Bene Gesserit breeding mastery awed him.\n \"We will go back to the practice now,\" Duncan said.\n \"Don\u0027t damage yourself.\"\n \"You forget, Bashar. I remember a body as young as this one and right here on Giedi Prime.\"\n \"Gammu!\"\n \"It was properly renamed but my body still recalls the original. That is why they sent me here. I know it.\"\n Of course he would know it, Teg thought.\n Restored by the brief respite, Teg introduced a new element in the attack and sent a sudden burn-line against Duncan\u0027s left side.\n How easily Duncan parried the attack!\n He was using an oddly mixed variation on the five attitudes, each response seemingly invented before it was required.\n \"Each attack is a feather floating on the infinite road,\" Duncan said. His voice gave no hint of exertion. \"As the feather approaches, it is diverted and removed.\"\n As he spoke, he parried the shifting attack and countered.\n Teg\u0027s Mentat logic followed the movements into what he recognized as dangerous places. Dependencies and key logs!\n Duncan shifted over to attack, moving ahead of it, pacing his movements rather than responding. Teg was forced to his utmost abilities as the shadow forces burned and flickered across the floor. Duncan\u0027s weaving figure in its mobile cage danced along the space between them. Not one of Teg\u0027s hunter-seekers or burn-line counters touched the moving figure. Duncan was over them, under them, seeming totally unafraid of the real pain that this equipment could bring him.\n Once more, Duncan increased the speed of his attack.\n A bolt of pain shot up Teg\u0027s left arm from his hand on the controls to his shoulder.\n With a sharp exclamation, Duncan shut down the equipment. \"Sorry, Bashar. That was superb defense on your part but I\u0027m afraid age defeated you.\"\n Once more, Duncan crossed the floor and stood over Teg.\n \"A little pain to remind me of the pain I caused you,\" Teg said. He rubbed his tingling arm.\n \"Blame the heat of the moment,\" Duncan said. \"We have done enough for now.\"\n \"Not quite,\" Teg said. \"It is not enough to strengthen only your muscles.\"\n At Teg\u0027s words Duncan felt an alerting sensation throughout his body. He sensed the disorganized touch of that uncompleted thing that the reawakening had failed to arouse. Something crouched within him, Duncan thought. It was like a coiled spring waiting for release.\n \"What more would you do?\" Duncan asked. His voice sounded hoarse.\n \"Your survival is in the balance here,\" Teg said. \"All of this is being done to save you and get you to Rakis.\"\n \"For Bene Gesserit reasons, which you say you do not know!\"\n \"I don\u0027t know them, Duncan.\"\n \"But you\u0027re a Mentat.\"\n \"Mentats require data to make projections.\"\n \"Do you think Lucilla knows?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure but let me warn you again about her. She has orders to get you to Rakis prepared for what you must do there.\"\n \"Must?\" Duncan shook his head from side to side. \"Am I not my own person with rights to make my own choices? What do you think you\u0027ve reawakened here, a damned Face Dancer capable only of obeying orders?\"\n \"Are you telling me you will not go to Rakis?\"\n \"I\u0027m telling you I will make my own decisions when I know what it is I\u0027m to do. I\u0027m not a hired assassin.\"\n \"You think I am, Duncan?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re an honorable man, someone to be admired. Give me credit for having my own standards of duty and honor.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been given another chance at life and -\"\n \"But you are not my father and Lucilla is not my mother. Imprinter? For what does she hope to prepare me?\"\n \"It may be that she does not know, Duncan. Like me, she may have only part of the design. Knowing how the Sisterhood works, that is highly likely.\"\n \"So the two of you just train me and deliver me to Arrakis. Here\u0027s the package you ordered!\"\n \"This is a far different universe than the one where you were originally born,\" Teg said. \"As it was in your day, we still have a Great Convention against atomics and the pseudoatomics of lasgun-shield interaction. We still say that sneak attacks are forbidden. There are pieces of paper scattered around to which we have put our names and we -\"\n \"But the no-ships have changed the basis for all of those treaties,\" Duncan said. \"I think I learned my history fairly well at the Keep. Tell me, Bashar, why did Paul\u0027s son have the Tleilaxu provide him with my ghola-self, hundreds of me! for all those thousands of years?\"\n \"Paul\u0027s son?\"\n \"The Keep\u0027s records call him the God Emperor. You name him Tyrant.\"\n \"Oh. I don\u0027t think we know why he did it. Perhaps he was lonely for someone from -\"\n \"You brought me back to confront the worm!\" Duncan said.\n Is that what we\u0027re doing? Teg wondered. He had considered this possibility more than once, but it was only a possibility, not a projection. Even so, there had to be something more in Taraza\u0027s design. Teg sensed this with every fiber of his Mentat training. Did Lucilla know? Teg did not delude himself that he could pry revelation from a full Reverend Mother. No... he would have to bide his time, wait and watch and listen. In his own way, this obviously was what Duncan had decided. It was a dangerous course if he thwarted Lucilla!\n Teg shook his head. \"Truly, Duncan, I do not know.\"\n \"But you follow orders.\"\n \"By my oath to the Sisterhood.\"\n \"Deceptions, dishonesties - those are empty words when the question is the Sisterhood\u0027s survival,\" Duncan quoted him.\n \"Yes, I said that,\" Teg agreed.\n \"I trust you now because you said it,\" Duncan said. \"But I do not trust Lucilla.\"\n Teg dropped his chin to his breast. Dangerous... dangerous...\n Much more slowly than once he had done, Teg brought his attention out of such thoughts and went through the mental cleansing process, concentrating on the necessities laid upon him by Taraza.\n \"You are my Bashar.\"\n Duncan studied the Bashar for a moment. Fatigue lines were obvious on the old man\u0027s face. Duncan was reminded suddenly of Teg\u0027s great age, wondering if it ever tempted men such as Teg to seek out the Tleilaxu and become gholas. Probably not. They knew they might become Tleilaxu puppets.\n This thought flooded Duncan\u0027s awareness, holding him immobile so plainly that Teg, lifting his gaze, saw it at once.\n \"Is something wrong?\"\n \"The Tleilaxu have done something to me, something that has not yet been exposed,\" Duncan husked.\n \"Exactly what we feared!\" It was Lucilla speaking from the doorway behind Teg. She advanced to within two paces of Duncan. \"I have been listening. You two are very informative.\"\n Teg spoke quickly, hoping to blunt the anger he sensed in her. \"He has mastered the seven attitudes today.\"\n \"He strikes like fire,\" Lucilla said, \"but remember that we of the Sisterhood flow like water and fill in every place.\" She glanced down at Teg. \"Do you not see that our ghola has gone beyond the attitudes?\"\n \"No fixed position, no attitude,\" Duncan said.\n Teg looked up sharply at Duncan, who stood with his head erect, his forehead smooth, his eyes clear as he returned Teg\u0027s gaze. Duncan had grown surprisingly in the short time since being awakened to his original memories.\n \"Damn you, Miles!\" Lucilla muttered.\n But Teg kept his attention on Duncan. The youth\u0027s entire body seemed wired to a new kind of vigor. There was a poise about him that had not been there before.\n Duncan shifted his attention to Lucilla. \"You think you will fail in your assignment?\"\n \"Surely not,\" she said. \"You\u0027re still a male.\"\n And she thought: Yes, that young body must flow hot with the juices of procreation. Indeed, the hormonal igniters are all intact and susceptible to arousing. His present stance, though, and the way he looked at her, forced her to raise her awareness to new, energy-demanding levels.\n \"What have the Tleilaxu done to you?\" she demanded.\n Duncan spoke with a flippancy that he did not feel: \"O Great Imprinter, if I knew I would tell you.\"\n \"You think it\u0027s a game we play?\" she demanded.\n \"I do not know what it is we play at!\"\n \"By now, many people know we are not on Rakis where we would have been expected to flee,\" she said.\n \"And Gammu swarms with people returned from the Scattering,\" Teg said. \"They have the numbers to explore many possibilities here.\"\n \"Who would suspect the existence of a lost no-globe from the Harkonnen days?\" Duncan asked.\n \"Anyone who made the association between Rakis and Dar-es-Balat,\" Teg said.\n \"If you think this is a game, consider the urgencies of the play,\" Lucilla said. She pivoted on one foot to concentrate on Teg. \"And you have disobeyed Taraza!\"\n \"You are wrong! I have done exactly what she ordered me to do. I am her Bashar and you forget how well she knows me.\"\n With an abruptness that shocked her to silence, the subtleties of Taraza\u0027s maneuverings impressed themselves upon Lucilla...\n We are pawns!\n What a delicate touch Taraza always demonstrated in the way she moved her pawns about. Lucilla did not feel diminished by the realization that she was a pawn. That was knowledge bred and trained into every Reverend Mother of the Sisterhood. Even Teg knew it. Not diminished, no. The thing around them had escalated in Lucilla\u0027s awareness. She felt awed by Teg\u0027s words. How shallow had been her previous view of the forces within which they were enmeshed. It was as though she had seen only the surface of a turbulent river and, from that, had glimpsed the currents beneath. Now, however, she felt the flow all around her and a dismaying realization.\n Pawns are expendable.\n By your belief in singularities, in granular absolutes, you deny movement, even the movement of evolution! While you cause a granular universe to persist in your awareness, you are blind to movement. When things change, your absolute universe vanishes, no longer accessible to your self-limiting perceptions. The universe has moved beyond you.\n - First Draft, Atreides Manifesto, Bene Gesserit Archives\n Taraza put her hands beside her temples, palms flat in front of her ears, and pressed inward. Even her fingers could feel the tiredness in there: right between the hands - fatigue. A brief flicker of eyelids and she fell into the relaxation trance. Hands against head were the sole focal points of fleshly awareness.\n One hundred heartbeats.\n She had practiced this regularly since learning it as a child, one of her first Bene Gesserit skills. Exactly one hundred heartbeats. After all of those years of practice, her body could pace them automatically by an unconscious metronome.\n When she opened her eyes at the count of one hundred, her head felt better. She hoped she would have at least two more hours in which to work before fatigue overcame her once more. Those one hundred heartbeats had given her extra years of wakefulness in her lifetime.\n Tonight, though, thinking of that old trick sent her memories spiraling backward. She found herself caught in her own childhood, the dormitory with the Sister Proctor pacing the aisle at night to make sure they all remained properly asleep in their beds.\n Sister Baram, the Night Proctor.\n Taraza had not thought of that name in years. Sister Baram had been short and fat, a failed Reverend Mother. Not for any immediately visible reason, but the Medical Sisters and their Suk doctors had found something. Baram had never been permitted to try the spice agony. She had been quite forthcoming about what she knew of her defect. It had been discovered while she was still in her teens: periodic nerve tremors, which manifested when she began to sink into sleep. A symptom of something deeper that had caused her to be sterilized. The tremors made Baram wakeful in the night. Aisle patrol was a logical assignment.\n Baram had other weaknesses not detected by her superiors. A wakeful child toddling to the washroom could lure Baram into low-voiced conversation. Naive questions elicited mostly naive answers, but sometimes Baram imparted useful knowledge. She had taught Taraza the relaxation trick.\n One of the older girls had found Sister Baram dead in the washroom one morning. The Night Proctor\u0027s tremors had been the symptom of a fatal defect, a fact important mostly to the Breeding Mistresses and their endless records.\n Because the Bene Gesserit did not usually schedule the full \"solo death education\" until well into the acolyte stage, Sister Baram was the first dead person Taraza had seen. Sister Baram\u0027s body had been found partly beneath a washbasin, the right cheek pressed to the tile floor, her left hand caught in the plumbing under a sink. She had tried to pull her failing body upright and death had caught her in the attempt, exposing that last motion like an insect caught in amber.\n When they rolled Sister Baram over to carry her away, Taraza saw the red mark where a cheek had been pressed to the floor. The Day Proctor explained this mark with a scientific practicality. Any experience could be turned into data for these potential Reverend Mothers to incorporate later into their acolyte \"Conversations With Death.\"\n Post Mortem lividity.\n Seated at her Chapter House table, all of those years removed from the event, Taraza was forced to use her carefully focused powers of concentration to dispel that memory, leaving her free to deal with the work spread before her. So many lessons. So fearfully full, her memory. So many lifetimes stored there. It reaffirmed her sense of being alive to see the work in front of her. Things to do. She was needed. Eagerly, Taraza bent to her labors.\n Damn the necessity to train the ghola on Gammu!\n But this ghola required it. Familiarity with dirt underfoot preceded the required restoration of that original persona.\n It had been wise to send Burzmali into the Gammu arena. If Miles had really found a hideaway... if he were to emerge now, he would need all the help he could get. Once more, she considered whether it was time to play the prescient game. So dangerous! And the Tleilaxu had been alerted that their replacement ghola might be required.\n \"Ready him for delivery.\"\n Her mind swung to the Rakis problem. That fool Tuek should have been monitored more carefully. How long could a Face Dancer safely impersonate him? There was no faulting Odrade\u0027s on-scene decision, though. She had put the Tleilaxu into an untenable position. The impersonator could be exposed, plunging the Bene Tleilax into a sink of hatred.\n The game within the Bene Gesserit design had become very delicate. For generations now, they had held out to the Rakian priesthood the bait of a Bene Gesserit alliance. But now! The Tleilaxu must consider that they had been chosen instead of the priests. Odrade\u0027s three-cornered alliance, let the priests think every Reverend Mother would take the Oath of Subservience to the Divided God. The Priestly Council would stutter with excitement at the prospect. The Tleilaxu, of course, saw the chance to monopolize melange, controlling at last the one source independent of them.\n A rap at Taraza\u0027s door told her the acolyte had arrived with tea. It was a standing order when the Mother Superior worked late. Taraza glanced at the table chrono, an Ixian device so accurate it would gain or lose only one second in a century: 1:23:11 A.M.\n She called to admit the acolyte. The girl, a pale blond with coldly observant eyes, entered and bent to arrange the contents of her tray beside Taraza.\n Taraza ignored the girl and stared at the work remaining on the table. So much to do. Work was more important than sleep. But her head ached and she felt the telltale dazed sensation akin to a stunned brain that told her the tea would provide little relief. She had worked herself into mental starvation and it would have to be put right before she could even stand. Her shoulders and back throbbed.\n The acolyte started to leave but Taraza motioned for her to wait. \"Rub my back please, Sister.\"\n The acolyte\u0027s educated hands slowly worked out the constrictions in Taraza\u0027s back. Good girl. Taraza smiled at this thought. Of course she was good. No lesser creature could be assigned to the Mother Superior.\n When the girl had gone, Taraza sat silently in deep thought. So little time. She begrudged every minute of sleep. There was no escaping it, though. Eventually, the body made its unavoidable demands. She had pressed herself beyond easy recuperation for days now. Ignoring the tea laid out beside her, Taraza arose and went down the hall to her tiny sleeping cell. There, she left a call with the Night Guard for 11:00 A.M. and composed herself fully robed on the hard cot.\n Quietly, she regulated her breathing, insulated her senses from distraction and fell into the between-state.\n Sleep did not come.\n She went through her full repertoire and still sleep evaded her.\n Taraza lay there for a long time, recognizing at last the futility of willing herself to sleep with any of the techniques at her disposal. The between-state would have to do its slow mending first. Meanwhile, her mind continued to churn.\n The Rakian priesthood she had never considered to be a central problem. Already caught up in religion, the priests could be manipulated by religion. They saw the Bene Gesserit chiefly as a power that could enforce their dogma. Let them continue to think this. It was bait that would blind them.\n Damn that Miles Teg! Three months of silence, and no favorable report from Burzmali, either. Charred ground, signs of a no-ship\u0027s lift-off. Where could Teg have gone? The ghola might be dead. Teg had never before done such a thing. Old Reliability. That was why she had chosen him. That and his military skills and his likeness to the old Duke Leto - all of the things they had prepared in him.\n Teg and Lucilla. A perfect team.\n If not dead, was the ghola beyond their reach? Did the Tleilaxu have him? Attackers from the Scattering? Many things were possible. Old Reliability. Silent. Was his silence a message? If so, what was he trying to say\u0027?\n With both Schwangyu and Patrin dead, there was the smell of conspiracy around the Gammu events, Could Teg be someone planted long ago by the Sisterhood\u0027s enemies? Impossible! His own family was proof against such doubts. Teg\u0027s daughter at the family home was as mystified as anyone.\n Three months now and not a word.\n Caution. She had warned Teg to exercise the utmost caution in protecting the ghola. Teg had seen the great danger on Gammu. Schwangyu\u0027s last reports made that clear.\n Where could Teg and Lucilla have taken the ghola?\n Where had they acquired a no-ship? Conspiracy?\n Taraza\u0027s mind kept circling around her deep suspicions. Was it Odrade\u0027s doing? Then who conspired with Odrade? Lucilla? Odrade and Lucilla had never met before that brief encounter on Gammu. Or had they? Who bent close to Odrade and breathed a mutual air weighted with whispers? Odrade gave no sign, but what proof was that? Lucilla\u0027s loyalty had never been doubted. They both functioned perfectly as assigned. But so would conspirators.\n Facts! Taraza hungered for facts. The bed rustled beneath her and her sense-insulation collapsed, shattered by worries as much as by the sound of her own movements. Resignedly, Taraza once more composed herself for relaxation.\n Relaxation and then sleep.\n Ships from the Scattering flitted through Taraza\u0027s fatigue-fogged imagination. Lost Ones returned in their uncounted no-ships. Was that where Teg found a ship? This possibility was being explored as quietly as they could on Gammu and elsewhere. She tried counting imaginary ships but they refused to proceed in the orderly fashion required for sleep induction. Taraza came alert without moving on her cot.\n Her deepest mind was trying to reveal something. Fatigue had blocked that path of communication but now - she sat up fully awake.\n The Tleilaxu had been dealing with people returned from the Scattering. With these whorish Honored Mattes and with returned Bene Tleilax as well. Taraza sensed a single design behind events. The Lost Ones did not return out of simple curiosity about their roots. The gregarious desire to reunite all of humankind was not enough in itself to bring them back. The Honored Matres clearly came with dreams of conquest.\n But what if the Tleilaxu sent out in the Scattering had not carried with them the secret of the axlotl tanks? What then? Melange. The orange-eyed whores obviously used an inadequate substitute. The people of the Scattering might not have solved the mystery of the Tleilaxu tanks. They would know about axlotl tanks and try to recreate them. But if they failed - melange!\n She began to explore this projection.\n The Lost Ones ran out of the true melange their ancestors took into the Scattering. What sources did they have then? The worms of Rakis and the original Bene Tleilax. The whores would not dare reveal their true interest. Their ancestors believed that the worms could not be transplanted. Was it possible the Lost Ones had found a suitable planet for the worms? Of course it was possible. They might begin bargaining with the Tleilaxu as a diversion. Rakis would be their real target. Or the reverse could be true.\n Transportable wealth.\n She had seen Teg\u0027s reports on the wealth being accumulated on Gammu. Some among the ones returning had coinages and other negotiable chips. That much was plain from the banking activities.\n What greater currency was there, though, than the spice?\n Wealth. That was it, of course. And whatever the chips, the bargaining had begun.\n Taraza grew aware of voices outside her door. The acolyte Sleep-Guard was arguing with someone. The voices were low but Taraza heard enough to bring her into full alert.\n \"She left a wake-up for late morning,\" the Sleep-Guard protested.\n Someone else whispered: \"She said she was to be told the moment I returned.\"\n \"I tell you she is very tired. She needs -\"\n \"She needs to be obeyed! Tell her I\u0027m back!\"\n Taraza sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the cot. Her feet found the floor. Gods! How her knees ached. It pained her, too, that she could not place the intruding whisper, the person arguing with her guard.\n Whose return did I... Burzmali!\n \"I\u0027m awake,\" Taraza called.\n Her door opened and the Sleep-Guard leaned in. \"Mother Superior, Burzmali has returned from Gammu.\"\n \"Send him in at once!\" Taraza activated a single glowglobe at the head of her cot. Its yellow light washed away the room\u0027s darkness.\n Burzmali entered and closed the door behind him. Without being told. he touched the sound-insulation switch on the door and all outside noises vanished.\n Privacy? It was bad news then.\n She looked up at Burzmali. He was a short, slender fellow with a sharply triangular face narrowing to a thin chin. Blond hair swept over a high forehead. His widely spaced green eyes were alert and watchful. He looked far too young for the responsibilities of a Bashar, but then Teg had looked even younger at Arbelough. We are getting old, damn it. She forced herself to relax and place her trust in the fact that Teg had trained this man and expressed full confidence in him.\n \"Tell me the bad news,\" Taraza said.\n Burzmali cleared his throat. \"Still no sign of the Bashar and his party on Gammu, Mother Superior.\" He had a heavy, masculine voice.\n And that\u0027s not the worst of it, Taraza thought. She saw the clear signs of Burzmali\u0027s nervousness.\n \"Let\u0027s have it all,\" she ordered. \"Obviously, you have completed your examination of the Keep\u0027s ruins.\"\n \"No survivors,\" he said. \"The attackers were thorough.\"\n \"Tleilaxu?\"\n \"Possible.\"\n \"You have doubts?\"\n \"The attackers used that new Ixian explosive, 12-Uri. I... I think it may have been used to mislead us. There were mechanical brain-probe holes in Schwangyu\u0027s skull, too.\"\n \"What of Patrin?\"\n \"Exactly as Schwangyu reported. He blew himself up in that decoy ship. They identified him from bits of two fingers and one intact eye. There was nothing left big enough to probe.\"\n \"But you have doubts! Get to them!\"\n \"Schwangyu left a message that only we might read.\"\n \"In the wear marks on furniture?\"\n \"Yes, Mother Superior, and -\"\n \"Then she knew she would be attacked and had time to leave a message. I saw your earlier report on the devastation of the attack.\"\n \"It was quick and totally overpowering. The attackers did not try to take captives.\"\n \"What did she say?\"\n \"Whores.\"\n Taraza tried to contain her shock, although she had been expecting that word. The effort to remain calm almost drained her energies. This was very bad. Taraza permitted herself a deep sigh. Schwangyu\u0027s opposition had persisted to the end. But then, seeing disaster, she had made a proper decision. Knowing she would die without the opportunity to transfer her Memory Lives to another Reverend Mother, she had acted from the most basic loyalty. If you can do nothing else, arm your Sisters and frustrate the enemy.\n So the Honored Matres have acted!\n \"Tell me about your search for the ghola,\" Taraza ordered.\n \"We were not the first searchers over that ground, Mother Superior. There was much additional burning of trees and rocks and underbrush.\"\n \"But it was a no-ship?\"\n \"The marks of a no-ship.\"\n Taraza nodded to herself. A silent message from Old Reliability?\n \"How closely did you examine the area?\"\n \"I flew over it but on a routine trip from one place to another.\"\n Taraza motioned Burzmali to a chair near the foot of her cot. \"Sit down and relax. I want you to do some guessing for me.\"\n Burzmali lowered himself carefully onto the chair. \"Guessing?\"\n \"You were his favorite student. I want you to imagine that you are Miles Teg. You know you must get the ghola out of the Keep. You do not place your full trust in anyone around you, not even in Lucilla. What will you do?\"\n \"An unexpected thing, of course.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n Burzmali rubbed his narrow chin. Presently, he said: \"I trust Patrin. I trust him fully.\"\n \"All right, you and Patrin. What do you do?\"\n \"Patrin is a native of Gammu.\"\n \"I have been wondering about that myself,\" she said.\n Burzmali looked at the floor in front of him. \"Patrin and I will make an emergency plan long before it is needed. I always prepare secondary ways of dealing with problems.\"\n \"Very good. Now - the plan. What do you do?\"\n \"Why did Patrin kill himself?\" Burzmali asked.\n \"You\u0027re sure that\u0027s what he did.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-17.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) \n With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
