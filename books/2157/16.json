Lucilla\u0027s face blended with that of the Lady Jessica, beloved of Leto Atreides. Duncan glanced at Teg, back to Lucilla, shaking the tears from his eyes as he moved. The memory faces dissolved into that of the real Lucilla standing in front of him. Similarities... but never the same. Never again the same.\\n\\n Imprinter.\\n\\n He could guess the meaning. A pure Duncan Idaho wildness arose in him. \"Is it my child you want in your womb, Imprinter? I know you\u0027re not called mothers for nothing.\"\\n\\n Her voice cold, Lucilla said: \"We\u0027ll discuss it another time.\"\\n\\n \"Let us discuss it in a congenial place,\" Duncan said. \"Perhaps I\u0027ll sing you a song. Not as good as old Gurney Halleck would do it but good enough to prepare for a little bedsport.\"\\n\\n \"You find this amusing?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Amusing? No, but I am reminded of Gurney. Tell me, Bashar, have you brought him back from the dead, too?\"\\n\\n \"Not to my knowledge,\" Teg said.\\n\\n \"Ahhhh, there was a singing man!\" Duncan said. \"He could be killing you while he sang and never miss a note.\"\\n\\n Her manner still icy, Lucilla said: \"We of the Bene Gesserit have learned to avoid music. It evokes too many confusing emotions. Memory-emotions, of course.\"\\n\\n It was meant to awe him with a reminder of all those Other Memories and the Bene Gesserit powers these implied but Duncan only laughed louder.\\n\\n \"What a shame that is,\" he said. \"You miss so much of life.\" And he began humming an old Halleck refrain:\\n\\n \"Review friends, troops long past review...\"\\n\\n But his mind whirled elsewhere with the rich new flavor of these reborn moments and once more he felt the eager touch of something powerful that remained buried within him. Whatever it was, it was violent and it concerned Lucilla, the Imprinter. In imagination, he saw her dead and her body awash in blood.\\n\\n People always want something more than immediate joy or that deeper sense called happiness. This is one of the secrets by which we shape the fulfillment of our designs. The something more assumes amplified power with people who cannot give it a name or who (most often the case) do not even suspect its existence. Most people only react unconsciously to such hidden forces. Thus, we have only to call a calculated something more into existence, define it and give it shape, then people will follow.\\n\\n - Leadership Secrets of the Bene Gesserit\\n\\n With a silent Waff about twenty paces ahead of them, Odrade and Sheeana walked down a weed-fringed road beside a spice-storage yard. All of them wore new desert robes and glistening stillsuits. The gray nulplaz fence that defined the yard beside them held bits of grass and cottony seedpods in its meshes. Looking at the seedpods, Odrade thought of them as life trying to break through a human intervention.\\n\\n Behind them, the blocky buildings that had arisen around Dar-es-Balat baked in the sunlight of early afternoon. Hot dry air burned her throat when she inhaled too quickly. Odrade felt dizzy and at war within herself. Thirst nagged at her. She walked as though balanced on the edge of a precipice. The situation she had created at Taraza\u0027s command might explode momentarily.\\n\\n How fragile it is!\\n\\n Three forces balanced, not really supporting each other but joined by motives that could shift in an instant and topple the whole alliance. The military people sent by Taraza did not reassure Odrade. Where was Teg? Where was Burzmali? For that matter, where was the ghola? He should be here by now. Why had she been ordered to delay matters?\\n\\n Today\u0027s venture would certainly delay matters! Although it had Taraza\u0027s blessing, Odrade thought this excursion into the desert of the worms might be a permanent delay. And there was Waff. If he survived, would there be any pieces for him to pick up?\\n\\n Despite the healing applications of the Sisterhood\u0027s best quicknit amplifiers, Waff said his arms still ached where Odrade had broken them. He was not complaining, merely providing information. He appeared to accept their fragile alliance, even the modifications that incorporated the Rakian priestly cabal. No doubt he was reassured that one of his own Face Dancers occupied the High Priest\u0027s bench in the guise of Tuek. Waff spoke forcefully when he demanded his \"breeding mothers\" from the Bene Gesserit and, consequently, withheld his part of their bargain.\\n\\n \"Only a small delay while the Sisterhood reviews the new agreement,\" Odrade explained. \"Meanwhile...\"\\n\\n Today was \"meanwhile.\"\\n\\n Odrade put aside her misgivings and began to enter the mood of this venture. Waff\u0027s behavior fascinated her, especially his reaction on meeting Sheeana: quite plainly fearful and more than a little in awe.\\n\\n The minion of his Prophet.\\n\\n Odrade glanced sideways at the girl walking dutifully beside her. There was the real leverage for shaping these events into the Bene Gesserit design.\\n\\n The Sisterhood\u0027s breakthrough into the reality behind Tleilaxu behavior excited Odrade. Waff\u0027s fanatic \"true faith\" gained shape with each new response from him. She felt fortunate just to be here studying a Tleilaxu Master in a religious setting. The very grit under Waff\u0027s feet ignited behavior that she had been trained to identify.\\n\\n We should have guessed, Odrade thought. The manipulations of our own Missionaria Protectiva should have told us how the Tleilaxu did it: keeping themselves to themselves, blocking off every intrusion for all of those plodding millennia.\\n\\n They did not appear to have copied the Bene Gesserit structure. And what other force could do such a thing? It was a religion. The Great Belief!\\n\\n Unless the Tleilaxu are using their ghola system as a kind of immortality.\\n\\n Taraza could be right. Reincarnated Tleilaxu Masters would not be like Reverend Mothers - no Other Memories, only personal memories. But prolonged!\\n\\n Fascinating!\\n\\n Odrade looked ahead at Waff\u0027s back. Plodding. It appeared to come naturally to him. She recalled that he called Sheeana \"Alyama.\" Another confirming linguistic insight into Waff\u0027s Great Belief. It meant \"Blessed One.\" The Tleilaxu had kept an ancient language not only alive but unchanged.\\n\\n Did Waff not know that only powerful forces such as religions did that?\\n\\n We have the roots of your obsession in our grasp, Waff! It is not unlike some that we have created. We know how to manipulate such things for our own purposes.\\n\\n Taraza\u0027s communication burned in Odrade\u0027s awareness: \"The Tleilaxu plan is transparent: Ascendancy. The human universe must be made into a Tleilaxu universe. They could not hope to achieve such a goal without help from the Scattering. Ergo.\"\\n\\n The Mother Superior\u0027s reasoning could not be denied. Even the opposition within that deep schism that threatened to shatter the Sisterhood agreed. But the thought of those human masses in the Scattering, their numbers exploding exponentially, produced a lonely sense of desperation in Odrade.\\n\\n We are so few compared to them.\\n\\n Sheeana stooped and picked up a pebble. She looked at it a moment and then threw it at the fence beside them. The pebble sailed through the meshes without touching them.\\n\\n Odrade took a firmer grip on herself. The sounds of their footsteps on the blown sand that drifted across this little-used roadway seemed suddenly over-loud. The spindly causeway leading out over the Dar-es-Balat ring-qanat and moat lay no more than two hundred paces ahead at the end of this narrow road.\\n\\n Sheeana spoke: \"I am doing this because you ordered it, Mother. But I still don\u0027t know why.\"\\n\\n Because this is the crucible where we test Waff and, through him, reshape the Tleilaxu!\\n\\n \"It is a demonstration,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n That was true. It was not the whole truth, but it served.\\n\\n Sheeana walked head down, gaze intent on where she placed each step. Was this how she always approached her Shaitan? Odrade wondered. Thoughtful and remote?\\n\\n Odrade heard a faint thwocking sound high up behind her. The watchful ornithopters were arriving. They would keep their distance, but many eyes would observe this demonstration.\\n\\n \"I will dance,\" Sheeana said. \"That usually calls a big one.\"\\n\\n Odrade felt her heartbeat quicken. Would the \"big one\" continue to obey Sheeana despite the presence of two companions?\\n\\n This is suicidal madness!\\n\\n But it had to be done: Taraza\u0027s orders.\\n\\n Odrade glanced at the fenced spice yard beside them. The place appeared oddly familiar. More than deja vu. Inner certainty informed by Other Memories told her this place remained virtually unchanged from ancient times. The design of the spice silos in the yard was as old as Rakis: oval tanks on tall legs, metal and plaz insects waiting stilt-legged to leap upon their prey. She suspected an unconscious message from the original designers: Melange is both boon and bane.\\n\\n Beneath the silos, a sandy wasteland where no growth was permitted spread out beside mud-walled buildings, an amoeba arm of Dar-es-Balat reaching almost to the qanat edge. The Tyrant\u0027s long-hidden no-globe had produced a teeming religious community that hid most of its activities behind windowless walls and underground.\\n\\n The secret working of our unconscious desires!\\n\\n Once more, Sheeana spoke: \"Tuek is different.\"\\n\\n Odrade saw Waff\u0027s head lift sharply. He had heard. He would be thinking: Can we conceal things from the Prophet\u0027s messenger?\\n\\n Too many people already knew that a Face Dancer masqueraded as Tuek, Odrade thought. The priestly cabal, of course, believed they were giving the Tleilaxu enough netting in which to snare not only the Bene Tleilax but the Sisterhood as well.\\n\\n Odrade smelled the biting odors of chemicals that had been used to kill wild growth in the spice storage yard. The odors forced her attention back to necessities. She did not dare indulge in mental wanderings out here! It would be so easy for the Sisterhood to become caught in its own trap.\\n\\n Sheeana stumbled and emitted a small cry, more irritation than pain. Waff turned his head sharply and looked at Sheeana before returning his attention to the roadway. The child had merely stumbled on a break in the road surface, he saw. Drifted sand concealed places where the roadway had been cracked. The faery structure of the causeway ahead of him appeared sound, however. Not substantial enough to support one of the Prophet\u0027s descendants, but more than enough for a supplicant human to cross it into the desert.\\n\\n Waff thought of himself chiefly as a supplicant.\\n\\n I come as a beggar into the land of thy messenger, God.\\n\\n He had his suspicions about Odrade. The Reverend Mother had brought him here to drain him of his knowledge before killing him. With God\u0027s help, I may surprise her yet. He knew his body was proof against an Ixian Probe, although she obviously did not have such a cumbersome device on her person. But it was the strength of his own will and confidence in God\u0027s grace that reassured Waff.\\n\\n And what if the hand they hold out to us is held out in sincerity?\\n\\n That, too, would be God\u0027s doing.\\n\\n Alliance with the Bene Gesserit, firm control of Rakis: What a dream that was! The Shariat ascendant at last and the Bene Gesserit as missionaries.\\n\\n When Sheeana again missed her footing and uttered another small sound of complaint, Odrade said: \"Don\u0027t favor yourself, child!\"\\n\\n Odrade saw Waff\u0027s shoulders stiffen. He did not like that peremptory manner with his \"Blessed One.\" There was backbone in the little man. Odrade recognized it as the strength of fanaticism. Even if the worm came to kill him, Waff would not flee. Faith in God\u0027s will would carry him directly into his own death - unless he were shaken out of his religious security.\\n\\n Odrade suppressed a smile. She could follow his thinking process: God will soon reveal His Purpose.\\n\\n But Waff was thinking about his cells growing in the slow renewal at Bandalong. No matter what happened here, his cells would carry on for the Bene Tleilax... and for God - a serial Waff always serving the Great Belief.\\n\\n \"I can smell Shaitan, you know,\" Sheeana said.\\n\\n \"Right now?\" Odrade looked up at the causeway ahead of them. Waff already was a few steps onto that arching surface.\\n\\n \"No, only when he comes,\" Sheeana said.\\n\\n \"Of course you can, child. Anyone could.\"\\n\\n \"I can smell him a long way off.\"\\n\\n Odrade inhaled deeply through her nose, sorting the smells from the background of burnt flint: faint whiffs of melange... ozone, something distinctly acid. She motioned for Sheeana to precede her single-file onto the causeway. Waff was holding his steady twenty paces ahead. The causeway dipped down to the desert some sixty meters ahead of him.\\n\\n I will taste the sand at the first opportunity, Odrade thought. That will tell me many things.\\n\\n As she mounted the causeway over the water moat, she looked off to the southwest at a low barrier along the horizon. Abruptly, Odrade was confronted by a compelling Other Memory. There was none of the crispness in it of actual vision, but she recognized it - a mingling of images from the deepest sources within her.\\n\\n Damn! she thought. Not now!\\n\\n There was no escape. Such intrusions came with purpose, an unavoidable demand upon her awareness.\\n\\n Warning!\\n\\n She squinted at the horizon, allowing the Other Memory to superimpose itself: a long-ago high barrier far away out there... people moving along the top of it. There was a faery bridge in that memory-distance, insubstantial and beautiful. It linked one part of that vanished barrier to another part and she knew without seeing it that a river ran beneath that long-gone bridge. The Idaho River! Now, the superimposed image provided movement: objects falling from the bridge. They were too far away to identify but she had the labels for this image projection now. With a sense of horror and elation, she identified that scene.\\n\\n The faery bridge was collapsing! Tumbling into the river below it.\\n\\n This vision was not some random destruction. This was classical violence carried in many memories, which had come down to her in the moments of spice agony. Odrade could classify the finely tuned components of the image: Thousands of her ancestors had watched that scene in imaginative reconstruction. Not a real visual memory but an assemblage of accurate reports.\\n\\n That is where it happened!\\n\\n Odrade stopped and let the image projections have their way with her awareness. Warning! Something dangerous had been identified. She did not try to dig out the warning\u0027s substance. If she did that, she knew it could fall apart in skeins, any one of which might be relevant, but the original certainty would vanish.\\n\\n This thing out there was fixed in the Atreides history. Leto II, the Tyrant, had fallen to his dissolution from that faery bridge. The great worm of Rakis, the Tyrant God Emperor himself, had been tumbled from that bridge on his wedding peregrination.\\n\\n There! Right there in the Idaho River beneath his destroyed bridge, the Tyrant had been submerged in his own agony. Right there, the transubstantiation from which the Divided God was born - it all began there.\\n\\n Why is that a warning?\\n\\n Bridge and river had vanished from this land. The high wall that had enclosed the Tyrant\u0027s dryland Sareer was eroded into a broken line on a heat-shimmering horizon.\\n\\n If a worm came now with its encapsulated pearl of the Tyrant\u0027s forever-dreaming memory, would that memory be dangerous? So Taraza\u0027s opposition in the Sisterhood argued.\\n\\n \"He will awaken!\"\\n\\n Taraza and her advisors denied even the possibility.\\n\\n Still, this claxon from Odrade\u0027s Other Memories could not be shunted aside.\\n\\n \"Reverend Mother, why have we stopped?\"\\n\\n Odrade felt her awareness lurch back into an immediate present that demanded her attention. Out there in that warning vision was where the Tyrant\u0027s endless dream began but other dreams intruded. Sheeana stood in front of her with a puzzled expression.\\n\\n \"I was looking out there.\" Odrade pointed. \"That was where Shai-hulud began, Sheeana.\"\\n\\n Waff stopped at the end of the causeway, one step short of the encroaching sand and now about forty paces ahead of Odrade and Sheeana. Odrade\u0027s voice brought him to stiff alertness but he did not turn. Odrade could feel the displeasure in his posture. Waff would not like even a hint of cynicism directed at his Prophet. He always suspected cynicism from Reverend Mothers. Especially where religious matters were concerned. Waff was not yet ready to accept that the long-detested and feared Bene Gesserit might share his Great Belief. That ground would have to be filled in with care-as was always the way with the Missionaria Protectiva.\\n\\n \"They say there was a big river,\" Sheeana said.\\n\\n Odrade heard the lilting note of derision in Sheeana\u0027s voice. The child learned quickly!\\n\\n Waff turned and scowled at them. He heard it, too. What was he thinking about Sheeana now?\\n\\n Odrade held Sheeana\u0027s shoulder with one hand and pointed with the other. \"There was a bridge right there. The great wall of the Sareer was left open there to permit the passage of the Idaho River. The bridge spanned that break.\"\\n\\n Sheeana sighed. \"A real river,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Not a qanat and too big for a canal,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never seen a river,\" Sheeana said.\\n\\n \"That was where they dumped Shai-hulud into the river,\" Odrade said. She gestured to her left. \"Over on this side, many kilometers in that direction, he built his palace.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing over there but sand,\" Sheeana said.\\n\\n \"The palace was torn down in the Famine Times,\" Odrade said. \"People thought there was a hoard of spice in it. They were wrong, of course. He was much too clever for that.\"\\n\\n Sheeana leaned close to Odrade and whispered: \"There is a great treasure of the spice, though. The chantings tell about it. I\u0027ve heard it many times. My... they say it\u0027s in a cave.\"\\n\\n Odrade smiled. Sheeana referred to the Oral History, of course. And she had almost said: \"My father...\" meaning her real father who had died in this desert. Odrade already had lured that story from the girl.\\n\\n Still whispering close to Odrade\u0027s ear, Sheeana said: \"Why is that little man with us? I don\u0027t like him.\"\\n\\n \"It is necessary for the demonstration,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n Waff took that moment to step off the causeway onto the first soft slope of open sand. He moved with care but no visible hesitation. Once on the sand, he turned, his eyes glistening in the hot sunlight, and stared first at Sheeana and then at Odrade.\\n\\n Still that awe in him when he looks at Sheeana, Odrade thought. What great things he believes he will discover here. He will be restored. And the prestige!\\n\\n Sheeana sheltered her eyes with one hand and studied the desert.\\n\\n \"Shaitan likes the heat,\" Sheeana said. \"People hide inside when it\u0027s hot but that\u0027s when Shaitan comes.\"\\n\\n Not Shai-hulud, Odrade thought. Shaitan! You predicted it well, Tyrant. What else did you know about our times?\\n\\n Was it really the Tyrant out there dormant in all of his worm descendants?\\n\\n None of the analyses Odrade had studied gave a sure explanation of what had driven one human being to make himself into a symbiote with that original worm of Arrakis. What went through his mind in the millennia of that awful transformation? Was any of that, even the smallest fragment, preserved in today\u0027s Rakian worms?\\n\\n \"He is near, Mother,\" Sheeana said. \"Do you smell him?\"\\n\\n Waff peered apprehensively at Sheeana.\\n\\n Odrade inhaled deeply: a rich swelling of cinnamon on the bitter flint undertones. Fire, brimstone - the crystal-banked inferno of the great worm. She stooped and brought up a pinch of blown sand to her tongue. All of the background was there: the Dune of Other Memory and the Rakis of this day.\\n\\n Sheeana pointed at an angle to her left, directly into the light breeze from the desert. \"Out there. We must hurry.\"\\n\\n Without waiting for permission from Odrade, Sheeana ran lightly down the causeway, past Waff and out onto the first dune. She stopped there until Odrade and Waff caught up with her. Off the dune face she led them, up another with sand clogging their passage, out along a great curving barracan with wisps of dusty saltation blowing from its crest. Soon, they had put almost a kilometer between themselves and the water-girded security of Dar-es-Balat.\\n\\n Again, Sheeana stopped.\\n\\n Waff came to a panting halt behind her. Perspiration glistened where his stillsuit hood crossed his brow.\\n\\n Odrade stopped a pace behind Waff. She took deep, calming breaths while she peered past Waff to where Sheeana\u0027s attention was fixed.\\n\\n A furious tide of sand had poured across the desert beyond the dune where they stood, driven by a storm wind. Bedrock lay exposed in a long narrow avenue of giant boulders, which lay scattered and upturned like the broken building blocks of a mad promethean. Through this wild maze, the sand had poured like a river, leaving its signature in deep scratches and gouges, then plunging off a low escarpment to lose itself in more dunes.\\n\\n \"Down there,\" Sheeana said, pointing at the avenue of bedrock. Off their dune she went, sliding and scrambling in spilled sand. At the bottom, she stopped beside a boulder at least twice her height.\\n\\n Waff and Odrade paused just behind her.\\n\\n The slipface of another giant barracan, sinuous as the back of a sporting whale, lifted into the silver-blue sky beside them.\\n\\n Odrade used the pause to recompose her oxygen balance. That mad run had made great demands on flesh. Waff, she noted, was red-faced and breathing deeply. The flinty cinnamon smell was oppressive in the confined passage. Waff sniffed and rubbed at his nose with the back of a hand. Sheeana lifted herself on one toe, pivoted and darted ten paces across the rocky avenue. She put one foot up on the sandy incline of the outer dune and lifted both arms to the sky. Slowly at first and then with increasing tempo, she began to dance, moving up onto the sand.\\n\\n The \u0027thopter sounds grew louder overhead.\\n\\n \"Listen!\" Sheeana called, not pausing in her dance.\\n\\n It was not to the \u0027thopters that she called their attention. Odrade turned her head to present both ears to a new sound intruding on their rock-tumbled maze.\\n\\n A sibilant hiss, subterranean and muted by sand - it became louder with shocking swiftness. There was heat in it, a noticeable warming of the breeze that twisted down their rocky avenue. The hissing swelled to a crescendo roar. Abruptly, the crystal-ringed gaping of a gigantic mouth lifted over the dune directly above Sheeana.\\n\\n \"Shaitan!\" Sheeana screamed, not breaking the rhythm of her dance. \"Here I am, Shaitan!\"\\n\\n As it crested the dune, the worm dipped its mouth downward toward Sheeana. Sand cascaded around her feet, forcing her to stop her dance. The smell of cinnamon filled the rocky defile. The worm stopped above them.\\n\\n \"Messenger of God,\" Waff breathed.\\n\\n Heat dried the perspiration on Odrade\u0027s exposed face and made the automatic insulation of her stillsuit puff outward perceptibly. She inhaled deeply, sorting the components behind that cinnamon assault. The air around them was sharp with ozone and swiftly oxygen rich. Her senses at full alert, Odrade stored impressions.\\n\\n If I survive, she thought.\\n\\n Yes, this was valuable data. The day might come when others would use it.\\n\\n Sheeana backed out of the spilled sand onto the exposed rock. She resumed her dance, moving more wildly, flinging her head at each turn. Hair whipped across her face and each time she whirled to confront the worm, she screamed \"Shaitan!\"\\n\\n Daintily, like a child on unfamiliar ground, the worm once more moved forward. It slid across the dune crest, curled itself down onto the exposed rock and presented its burning mouth slightly above and about two paces from Sheeana.\\n\\n As it stopped, Odrade became conscious of the deep furnace rumbling of the worm. She could not tear her gaze away from the reflections of lambent orange flames within the creature. It was a cave of mysterious fire.\\n\\n Sheeana stopped her dance. She clenched both fists at her sides and stared back at the monster she had summoned.\\n\\n Odrade took timed breaths, the controlled pacing of a Reverend Mother gathering all of her powers. If this was the end - well, she had obeyed Taraza\u0027s orders. Let the Mother Superior learn what she would from the watchers overhead.\\n\\n \"Hello, Shaitan,\" Sheeana said. \"I have brought a Reverend Mother and a man of the Tleilaxu with me.\"\\n\\n Waff slumped to his knees and bowed.\\n\\n Odrade slipped past him to stand beside Sheeana.\\n\\n Sheeana breathed deeply. Her face was flushed.\\n\\n Odrade heard the click-ticking of their overworked stillsuits. The hot, cinnamon-drenched air around them was charged with the sounds of this meeting, all dominated by the murmurous burning within the quiescent worm.\\n\\n Waff came up beside Odrade, his trancelike gaze fixed on the worm.\\n\\n \"I am here,\" he whispered.\\n\\n Odrade silently cursed him. Any unwarranted noise could attract this beast onto them. She knew what Waff was thinking, though: No other Tleilaxu had ever stood this close to a descendant of his Prophet. Not even the Rakian priests had ever done this!\\n\\n With her right hand, Sheeana made a sudden downward gesture. \"Down to us, Shaitan!\" she said.\\n\\n The worm lowered its gaping mouth until the internal firepit filled the rocky defile in front of them.\\n\\n Her voice little more than a whisper, Sheeana said: \"See how Shaitan obeys me, Mother?\"\\n\\n Odrade could feel Sheeana\u0027s control over the worm, a pulse of hidden language between child and monster. It was uncanny.\\n\\n Her voice rising in impudent arrogance, Sheeana said: \"I will ask Shaitan to let us ride him!\" She scrambled up the slipface of the dune beside the worm.\\n\\n Immediately, the great mouth lifted to follow her movements. \"Stay there!\" Sheeana shouted. The worm stopped.\\n\\n It\u0027s not her words that command it, Odrade thought. Something else... something else...\\n\\n \"Mother, come with me,\" Sheeana called.\\n\\n Thrusting Waff ahead of her, Odrade obeyed. They scrambled up the sandy slope behind Sheeana. Dislodged sand spilled down beside the waiting worm, piling up in the defile. Ahead of them, the worm\u0027s tapering tail curved along the dune crest. Sheeana led them at a sand-clotted trot to the very tip of the thing. There, she gripped the leading edge of a ring in the corrugated surface and scrambled up onto her desert beast.\\n\\n More slowly, Odrade and Waff followed. The worm\u0027s warm surface felt non-organic to Odrade, as though it were some Ixian artifact.\\n\\n Sheeana skipped forward along the back and squatted just behind its mouth where the rings bulged thick and wide.\\n\\n \"Like this,\" Sheeana said. She leaned forward and clutched beneath the leading edge of a ring, lifting it slightly to expose pink softness underneath.\\n\\n Waff obeyed her immediately but Odrade moved with more caution, storing impressions. The ring surface was as hard as plascrete and covered with tiny encrustations. Odrade\u0027s fingers probed the softness under the leading edge. It pulsed faintly. The surface around them lifted and fell with an almost imperceptible rhythm. Odrade heard a tiny rasping with each movement.\\n\\n Sheeana kicked the worm surface behind her.\\n\\n \"Shaitan, go!\" she said.\\n\\n The worm did not respond.\\n\\n \"Please, Shaitan,\" Sheeana pleaded.\\n\\n Odrade heard the desperation in Sheeana\u0027s voice. The child was so confident of her Shaitan but Odrade knew that the girl had been allowed to ride only that first time. Odrade had the full story from death-wish to priestly confusion but none of it told her what would happen next.\\n\\n Abruptly, the worm lurched into motion. It lifted sharply, twisted to the left and made a tight curve out of the rocky defile, then moved directly away from Dar-es-Balat into the open desert.\\n\\n \"We go with God!\" Waff shouted.\\n\\n The sound of his voice shocked Odrade. Such wildness! She sensed the power in his faith. The thwock-thwock of following ornithopters came from overhead. The wind of their passage whipped past Odrade full of ozone and the hot furnace odors stirred up by the friction of the rushing behemoth.\\n\\n Odrade glanced over her shoulders at the \u0027thopters, thinking how easy it would be for enemies to rid this planet of a troublesome child, an equally troublesome Reverend Mother and a despised Tleilaxu - all in one violently vulnerable moment on the open desert. The priestly cabal might attempt it, she knew, hoping that Odrade\u0027s own watchers up there would be too late to prevent it.\\n\\n Would curiosity and fear hold them back?\\n\\n Odrade admitted to a mighty curiosity herself.\\n\\n Where is this thing taking us?\\n\\n Certainly, it was not headed toward Keen. She lifted her head and peered past Sheeana. On the horizon directly ahead lay that tell-tale indentation of fallen stones, that place where the Tyrant had been spilled from the surface of his faery bridge.\\n\\n The place of Other Memory warning.\\n\\n Abrupt revelation locked Odrade\u0027s mind. She understood the warning. The Tyrant had died at a place of his own choosing. Many deaths had left their imprint on that place but his the greatest. The Tyrant chose his peregrination route with purpose. Sheeana had not told her worm to go there. It moved that way of its own volition. The magnet of the Tyrant\u0027s endless dream drew it back to the place where the dream began.\\n\\n There was this drylander who was asked which was more important, a literjon of water or a vast pool of water? The drylander thought a moment and then said: \"The literjon is more important. No single person could own a great pool of water. But a literjon you could hide under your cloak and run away with it. No one would know.\" -The Jokes of Ancient Dune, Bene Gesserit Archives\\n\\n It was a long session in the no-globe\u0027s practice hall, Duncan in a mobile cage driving the exercise, adamant that this particular training series would continue until his new body had adapted to the seven central attitudes of combat response against attack from eight directions. His green singlesuit was dark with perspiration. Twenty days they had been at this one lesson!\\n\\n Teg knew the ancient lore that Duncan revived here but knew it by different names and sequencing. Before they had been into it five days, Teg doubted the superiority of modern methods. Now, he was convinced that Duncan did something completely new - mixing the old with what he had learned in the Keep.\\n\\n Teg sat at his own control console, as much an observer as a participant. The consoles that guided the dangerous shadow forces in this practice had required mental adjustment by Teg, but he felt familiar with them now and moved the attack with facility and frequent inspiration.\\n\\n A simmering Lucilla glanced into the hall occasionally. She watched and then left without comment. Teg did not know what Duncan was doing about the Imprinter but there was a feeling that the reawakened ghola played a delaying game with his seductress. She would not allow that to continue long, Teg knew, but it was out of his hands. Duncan no longer was \"too young\" for the Imprinter. That young body carried a mature male mind with experiences from which to make his own decisions.\\n\\n Duncan and Teg had been on the floor with only one break all morning. Hunger pangs gnawed at Teg but he felt reluctant to halt the session. Duncan\u0027s abilities had climbed to a new level today and he was still improving.\\n\\n Teg, seated in a fixed console\u0027s cage seat, twisted the attack forces into a complex maneuver, striking from left, right, and above.\\n\\n The Harkonnen armory had produced an abundance of these exotic weapons and training instruments, some of which Teg had known only from historical accounts. Duncan knew them all, apparently, and with an intimacy that Teg admired. Hunter-seekers geared to penetrate a force shield were part of the shadow system they used now.\\n\\n \"They automatically slow down to go through the shield,\" Duncan explained in his young-old voice. \"Too fast a strike, of course, and the shield repels.\"\\n\\n \"Shields of that type have almost gone out of fashion,\" Teg said. \"A few societies maintain them as a kind of sport but otherwise...\"\\n\\n Duncan executed a riposte of blurred speed that dropped three hunter-seekers to the floor damaged enough to require the no-globe\u0027s maintenance services. He removed the cage and damped the system but left it idling while he came over to Teg, breathing deeply but easily. Looking past Teg, Duncan smiled and nodded. Teg whirled but there was only the flick of Lucilla\u0027s gown as she left them.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like a duel,\" Duncan said. \"She tries to thrust through my guard and I counterattack.\"\\n\\n \"Have a care,\" Teg said. \"That\u0027s a full Reverend Mother.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve known a few of them in my time, Bashar.\"\\n\\n Once more, Teg found himself confounded. He had been warned that he would have to readjust to this different Duncan Idaho but he had not fully anticipated the constant mental demands of that readjustment. The look in Duncan\u0027s eyes right now was disconcerting.\\n\\n \"Our roles are changed a bit, Bashar,\" Duncan said. He picked up a towel from the floor and mopped his face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m no longer sure of what I can teach you,\" Teg admitted. He wished, though, that Duncan would take his warning about Lucilla. Did Duncan imagine that the Reverend Mothers of those ancient days were identical with the women of today? Teg thought that highly unlikely. In the way of all other life, the Sisterhood evolved and changed.\\n\\n It was obvious to Teg that Duncan had come to a decision about his place in Taraza\u0027s machinations. Duncan was not merely biding his time. He was training his body to a personally chosen peak and he had made a judgment about the Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n He has made that judgment on insufficient data, Teg thought.\\n\\n Duncan dropped the towel and looked at it for a moment. \"Let me be the judge of what you can teach me, Bashar.\" He turned and stared narrowly at Teg seated in the cage.\\n\\n Teg inhaled deeply. He smelled the faint ozone from all of this durable Harkonnen equipment ticking away in readiness for Duncan\u0027s return to action. The ghola\u0027s perspiration carried a bitter dominant.\\n\\n Duncan sneezed.\\n\\n Teg sniffed, recognizing the omnipresent dust of their activities. It could be more tasted than smelled at times. Alkaline. Over it all was the fragrance of the air scrubbers and oxy regenerators. There was a distinct floral aroma built into the system but Teg could not identify the flower. In the month of their occupation, the globe also had taken on human odors, slowly insinuated into the original composite - perspiration, cooking smells, the never-quite-suppressed acridity of waste reclamation. To Teg, these reminders of their presence were oddly offensive. And he found himself sniffing and listening for sounds of intrusion - something more than the echoing passage of their own footsteps and the subdued metallic clashings from the kitchen area.\\n\\n Duncan\u0027s voice intruded: \"You\u0027re an odd man, Bashar.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s your resemblance to the Duke Leto. The facial identity is weird. He was a bit shorter than you but the identity...\" He shook his head, thinking of the Bene Gesserit designs behind those genetic markers in Teg\u0027s face - that hawk look, the crease lines and that inner thing, that certainty of moral superiority. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-16.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) \\n With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
