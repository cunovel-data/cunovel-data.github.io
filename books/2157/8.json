I bid you farewell.\"\n \"Perhaps death will not part us,\" Taraza said. It was the traditional farewell of a Reverend Mother to a Sister-equal.\n \"Go!\" The heavy-featured man dashed to the corridor hatchway and flung it open, revealing two Ixian guards, looks of surprise on their faces. His voice hoarse, the man ordered: \"Take them to their lighter.\"\n Still relaxed and calm, Teg said: \"Summon your people, Mother Superior.\" To the man standing at the hatchway, Teg said: \"You value your own skin too much to be a good soldier. None of my people would have made such an error.\"\n \"There are true Honored Matres aboard this ship,\" the man grated. \"I am sworn to protect them.\"\n Teg grimaced and turned to where Taraza was leading her people from the adjoining room: two Reverend Mothers and four acolytes. Teg recognized one of the Reverend Mothers: Darwi Odrade. He had seen her before only at a distance but the oval face and lovely eyes were arresting: so like Lucilla.\n \"Do we have time for introductions?\" Taraza asked.\n \"Of course, Mother Superior.\"\n Teg nodded and grasped the hand of each woman as Taraza presented them.\n As they left, Teg turned to the uniformed stranger. \"One must always observe the niceties,\" Teg said. \"Otherwise we are less than human.\"\n Not until they were on the lighter, Taraza seated beside him and her entourage nearby, did Teg ask the overriding question.\n \"How did they take you?\"\n The lighter was plunging planetward. The screen in front of Teg showed that the Ix-branded Guildship obeyed his command to remain in orbit until his party was safely behind its planetary defenses.\n Before Taraza could respond, Odrade leaned across the aisle separating them and said: \"I have countermanded the Bashar\u0027s orders to destroy that Guildship, Mother.\"\n Teg swiveled his head sharply and glared at Odrade. \"But they took you captive and...\" He scowled. \"How did you know I -\"\n \"Miles!\"\n Taraza\u0027s voice conveyed overwhelming reproof. He grinned ruefully. Yes, she knew him almost as well as he knew himself... better in some respects.\n \"They did not just capture us, Miles,\" Taraza said. \"We allowed ourselves to be taken. Ostensibly, I was escorting Dar to Rakis. We left our no-ship at Junction and asked for the fastest Guild Transport. All of my Council, including Burzmali, agreed that these intruders from the Scattering would subvert the Transport and take us to you, aiming to pick up all the pieces of the ghola project.\"\n Teg was aghast. The risk!\n \"We knew you would rescue us,\" Taraza said. \"Burzmali was standing by in case you failed.\"\n \"That Guildship you\u0027ve spared,\" Teg said, \"will summon assistance and attack our -\"\n \"They will not attack Gammu,\" Taraza said. \"Too many diverse forces from the Scattering are assembled on Gammu. They would not dare alienate so many.\"\n \"I wish I were as certain of that as you appear to be,\" Teg said.\n \"Be certain, Miles. Besides, there are other reasons for not destroying the Guildship. Ix and the Guild have been caught taking sides. That\u0027s bad for business and they need all of the business they can get.\"\n \"Unless they have more important customers offering greater profits!\"\n \"Ahhhhh, Miles.\" She spoke in a musing voice. \"What we latter-day Bene Gesserit really do is try to let matters achieve a calmer tone, a balance. You know this.\"\n Teg found this true but he locked on one phrase: \"... latter-day...\" The words conveyed a sense of summation-at-death. Before he could question this, Taraza continued:\n \"We like to settle the most passionate situations off the battlefield. I must admit we have the Tyrant to thank for that attitude. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve ever thought of yourself as a product of the Tyrant\u0027s conditioning, Miles, but you are.\"\n Teg accepted this without comment. It was a factor in the entire spread of human society. No Mentat could avoid it as a datum.\n \"That quality in you, Miles, drew us to you in the first place,\" Taraza said. \"You can be damnably frustrating at times but we wouldn\u0027t have you any other way.\"\n By subtle revelations in tone and manner, Teg realized that Taraza was not speaking solely for his benefit, but was also directing her words at her entourage.\n \"Have you any idea, Miles, how maddening it is to hear you argue both sides of an issue with equal force? But your simpatico is a powerful weapon. How terrified some of our foes have been to find you confronting them where they had not the slightest suspicion you might appear!\"\n Teg allowed himself a tight smile. He glanced at the women seated across the aisle from them. Why was Taraza directing such words at this group? Darwi Odrade appeared to be resting, head back, eyes closed. Several of the others were chatting among themselves. None of this was conclusive to Teg. Even Bene Gesserit acolytes could follow several trains of thought simultaneously. He returned his attention to Taraza.\n \"You really feel things the way the enemy feels them,\" Taraza said. \"That is what I mean. And, of course, when you\u0027re in that mental frame there is no enemy for you.\"\n \"Yes, there is!\"\n \"Don\u0027t mistake my words, Miles. We have never doubted your loyalty. But it\u0027s uncanny how you make us see things we have no other way of seeing. There are times when you are our eyes.\"\n Darwi Odrade, Teg saw, had opened her eyes and was looking at him. She was a lovely woman. Something disturbing about her appearance. As with Lucilla, she reminded him of someone in his past. Before Teg could follow this thought, Taraza spoke.\n \"Has the ghola this ability to balance between opposing forces?\" she asked.\n \"He could be a Mentat,\" Teg said.\n \"He was a Mentat in one incarnation, Miles.\"\n \"Do you really want him awakened so young?\"\n \"It is necessary, Miles. Deadly necessary.\"\n The failure of CHOAM? Quite simple: They ignore the fact that larger commercial powers wait at the edges of their activities, powers that could swallow them the way a slig swallows garbage. This is the true threat of the Scattering - to them and to us all.\n - Bene Gesserit Council notes, Archives #SXX90CH\n Odrade spared only part of her awareness to the conversation between Teg and Taraza. Their lighter was a small one, its passenger quarters cramped. It would use atmospherics to dampen its descent, she knew, and she prepared herself for the buffeting. The pilot would be sparing of their suspensors on such a craft, saving energy.\n She used these moments as she used all such time now to gird herself for the coming necessities. Time pressed; a special calendar drove her. She had looked at a calendar before leaving Chapter House, caught as often happened to her by the persistence of time and its language: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years... Standard Years, to be precise. Persistence was an inadequate word for the phenomenon. Inviolability was more like it. Tradition. Never disturb tradition. She held the comparisons firmly in mind, the ancient flow of time imposed on planets that did not tick to the primitive human clock. A week was seven days. Seven! How powerful that number remained. Mystical. It was enshrined in the Orange Catholic Bible. The Lord made a world in six days \"and on the seventh day He rested.\"\n Good for Him! Odrade thought. We all should rest after great labors.\n Odrade turned her head slightly and looked across the aisle at Teg. He had no idea how many memories of him she possessed. She could mark how the years had treated that strong face. Teaching the ghola had drained his energies, she saw. That child in the Gammu Keep must be a sponge absorbing anything and everything around him.\n Miles Teg, do you know how we use you? she wondered.\n It was a thought that weakened her but she allowed it to persist in her awareness almost with a feeling of defiance. How easy it would be to love that old man! Not as a mate, of course... but love, nonetheless. She could feel the bond tugging at her and recognized it with the fine edge of her Bene Gesserit abilities. Love, damnable love, weakening love.\n Odrade had felt this tugging with the first mate she had been sent to seduce. Curious sensation. Her years of Bene Gesserit conditioning had made her wary of it. None of her proctors had allowed her the luxury of that unquestioning warmth, and she had learned in time the reasons behind such isolating care. But there she was, sent by the breeding mistresses, ordered to get that close to a single individual, to let him enter her. All of the clinical data lay there in her awareness and she could read the sexual excitement in her partner even as she allowed it in herself. She had, after all, been carefully prepared for this role by men the Breeding Mistresses selected and conditioned with exquisite nicety for just such training.\n Odrade sighed and looked away from Teg, closing her eyes in remembrance. Training Males never let their emotions reflect a bonding abandonment to their students. It was a necessary flaw in the sexual education.\n That first seduction upon which she had been sent: She had been quite unprepared for the melting ecstasy of a simultaneous orgasm, a mutuality and sharing as old as humankind... older! And with powers capable of overwhelming the reason. The look on her male companion\u0027s face, the sweet kiss, his total abandonment of all self-protective reserves, unguarded and supremely vulnerable. No Training Male had ever done that! Desperately, she grasped for the Bene Gesserit lessons. Through those lessons, she saw the essence of this man on his face, felt that essence in her deepest fibers. For just an instant, she permitted an equal response, experiencing a new height of ecstasy that none of her teachers had hinted might be attainable. For that instant, she understood what had happened to the Lady Jessica and the other Bene Gesserit failures.\n This feeling was love!\n Its power frightened her (as the Breeding Mistresses had known it would) and she fell back into the careful Bene Gesserit conditioning, allowing a mask of pleasure to take over the brief natural expression on her face, employing calculated caresses where natural caresses would have been easier (but less effective).\n The male responded as expected, stupidly. It helped to think of him as stupid.\n Her second seduction had been easier. She could still call up the features of that first one, though, doing it sometimes with a calloused sense of wonder. Sometimes, his face came to her of itself and for no reason she could identify immediately.\n With the other males she had been sent to breed, the memory markers were different. She had to hunt her past for the look of them. The sensory recordings of those experiences did not go as deep. Not so with that first one!\n Such was the dangerous power of love.\n And look at the troubles this hidden force had caused the Bene Gesserit over the millennia. The Lady Jessica and her love for her Duke had been only one example among countless others. Love clouded reason. It diverted the Sisters from their duties. Love could be tolerated only where it caused no immediate and obvious disruptions or where it served the larger purposes of the Bene Gesserit. Otherwise it was to be avoided.\n Always, though, it remained an object of disquieting watchfulness.\n Odrade opened her eyes and glanced again at Teg and Taraza. The Mother Superior had taken up a new subject. How irritating Taraza\u0027s voice could be at times! Odrade closed her eyes and listened to the conversation, tied to those two voices by some link in her awareness that she could not avoid.\n \"Very few people realize how much of the infrastructure in a civilization is dependency infrastructure,\" Taraza said. \"We have made quite a study of this.\"\n Love is a dependency-infrastructure, Odrade thought. Why had Taraza hit on this subject at this time? The Mother Superior seldom did anything without deep motives. \"Dependency infrastructure is a term that includes all things necessary for a human population to survive at existing or increased numbers,\" Taraza said.\n \"Melange?\" Teg asked.\n \"Of course, but most people look at the spice and say, \u0027How nice it is that we can have it and it can give us so much longer lives than were enjoyed by our ancestors.\u0027 \"\n \"Providing they can afford it.\" Teg\u0027s voice had a bite in it, Odrade noted.\n \"As long as no single power controls all of the market, most people have enough,\" Taraza said.\n \"I learned economics at my mother\u0027s knee,\" Teg said. \"Food, water, breathable air, living space not contaminated by poisons - there are many kinds of money and the value changes according to the dependency.\"\n As she listened to him, Odrade almost nodded in agreement. His response was her own. Don\u0027t belabor the obvious, Taraza! Get to your point.\n \"I want you to remember your mother\u0027s teachings very clearly,\" Taraza said. How mild her voice was suddenly! Taraza\u0027s voice changed abruptly then and she snapped: \"Hydraulic despotism!\"\n She does that shift of emphasis well, Odrade thought. Memory spewed up the data like a spigot suddenly opened full force. Hydraulic despotism: central control of an essential energy such as water, electricity, fuel, medicines, melange... Obey the central controlling power or the energy is shut off and you die!\n Taraza was talking once more: \"There\u0027s another useful concept that I\u0027m sure your mother taught you - the key log.\"\n Odrade was very curious now. Taraza was headed somewhere important with this conversation. Key log: a truly ancient concept from the days before suspensors when lumbermen sent their fallen timber rushing down rivers to central mill sites. Sometimes the logs jammed up in the river and an expert was brought in to find the one log, the key log, which would free the jam when removed. Teg, she knew, would have an intellectual understanding of the term but she and Taraza could call up actual witnesses from Other Memories, see the explosion of broken bits of wood and water as a jam was released.\n \"The Tyrant was a key log,\" Taraza said. \"He created the jam and he released it.\"\n The lighter began trembling sharply as it took its first bite of Gammu\u0027s atmosphere. Odrade felt the tightness of her restraining harness for a few seconds, then the craft\u0027s passage became steadier. Conversation stopped for this interval, then Taraza continued:\n \"Beyond the so-called natural dependencies are some religions that have been created psychologically. Even physical necessities can have such an underground component.\"\n \"A fact the Missionaria Protectiva understands quite well,\" Teg said. Again, Odrade heard that undercurrent of deep resentment in his voice. Taraza certainly must hear it, too. What was she doing? She could weaken Teg!\n \"Ahhh, yes,\" Taraza said. \"Our Missionaria Protectiva. Humans have such a powerful need that their own belief structure be the \u0027true belief.\u0027 If it gives you pleasure or a sense of security and if it is incorporated into your belief structure, what a powerful dependency that creates!\"\n Again, Taraza fell silent while their lighter went through another atmospheric buffeting.\n \"I wish he would use his suspensors!\" Taraza complained.\n \"It saves fuel,\" Teg said. \"Less dependency.\"\n Taraza chuckled. \"Oh, yes, Miles. You know the lesson well. I see your mother\u0027s hand in it. Damn the dam when the child strikes out in a dangerous direction.\"\n \"You think of me as a child?\" he asked.\n \"I think of you as someone who has just had his first direct encounter with the machinations of the so-called Honored Mattes.\"\n So that\u0027s it, Odrade thought. And with a feeling of shock, Odrade realized that Taraza was aiming her words at a broader target than just Teg.\n She\u0027s talking to me!\n \"These Honored Matres, as they call themselves,\" Taraza said, \"have combined sexual ecstasy and worship. I doubt that they have even guessed at the dangers.\"\n Odrade opened her eyes and looked across the aisle at the Mother Superior. Taraza\u0027s gaze was fixed intently on Teg, an unreadable expression except for the eyes, which burned with the necessity for him to understand.\n \"Dangers,\" Taraza repeated. \"The great mass of humankind possesses an unmistakable unit-identity. It can be one thing. It can act as a single organism.\"\n \"So the Tyrant said,\" Teg countered.\n \"So the Tyrant demonstrated! The Group Soul was his to manipulate. There are times, Miles, when survival demands that we commune with the soul. Souls, you know, are always seeking outlet.\"\n \"Hasn\u0027t communing with souls gone out of style in our time?\" Teg asked. Odrade did not like the bantering tone in his voice and noted that it aroused a matching anger in Taraza.\n \"You think I talk about fashions in religion?\" Taraza demanded, her high-pitched voice insistently harsh. \"We both know religions can be created! I\u0027m talking about these Honored Matres who ape some of our ways but have none of our deeper awareness. They dare place themselves at the center of worship!\"\n \"A thing the Bene Gesserit always avoids,\" he said. \"My mother said that worshipers and the worshiped are united by the faith.\"\n \"And they can be divided!\"\n Odrade saw Teg suddenly fall into Mentat mode, an unfocused stare in his eyes, his features placid. She saw now part of what Taraza was doing. The Mentat rides Roman, one foot on each steed. Each foot is based on a different reality as the pattern-search hurtles him forward. He must ride different realities to a single goal.\n Teg spoke in a Mentat\u0027s musing, unaccented voice: \"Divided forces will battle for supremacy.\"\n Taraza gave a sigh of pleasure almost sensual in its natural venting.\n \"Dependency infrastructure,\" Taraza said. \"These women from the Scattering would control dividing forces, all of those forces trying mightily to take the lead. That military officer on the Guildship, when he spoke of his Honored Matres, spoke with both awe and hatred. I\u0027m sure you heard it in his voice, Miles. I know how well your mother taught you.\"\n \"I heard.\" Teg was once more focused on Taraza, hanging on her every word as was Odrade.\n \"Dependencies,\" Taraza said. \"How simple they can be and how complex. Take, for example, tooth decay.\"\n \"Tooth decay?\" Teg was shocked off his Mentat track and Odrade, observing this, saw that his reaction was precisely what Taraza wanted. Taraza was playing her Mentat Bashar with a fine hand.\n And I am supposed to see this and learn from it, Odrade thought.\n \"Tooth decay,\" Taraza repeated. \"A simple implant at birth prevents this bane for most of humankind. Still, we must brush the teeth and otherwise care for them. It is so natural to us that we seldom think about it. The devices we use are assumed to be wholly ordinary parts of our environment. Yet the devices, the materials in them, the instructors in tooth care and the Suk monitors, all have their interlocked relationships.\"\n \"A Mentat does not need interdependencies explained to him,\" Teg said. There was still curiosity in his voice but with a definite undertone of resentment.\n \"Quite,\" Taraza said. \"That is the natural environment of a Mentat\u0027s thinking process.\"\n \"Then why do you belabor this?\"\n \"Mentat, look at what you now know of these Honored Matres and tell me: What is their flaw?\"\n Teg spoke without hesitation: \"They can only survive if they continue to increase the dependency of those who support them. It\u0027s an addict\u0027s dead-end street.\"\n \"Precisely. And the danger?\"\n \"They could take much of humankind down with them.\"\n \"That was the Tyrant\u0027s problem, Miles. I\u0027m sure he knew it. Now, pay attention to me with great care. And you, too, Dar.\" Taraza looked across the aisle and met Odrade\u0027s gaze. \"Both of you listen to me. We of the Bene Gesserit are setting very powerful... elements adrift in the human current. They may jam up. They are sure to cause damage. And we...\"\n Once more, the lighter entered a period of severe buffeting. Conversation was impossible while they clung to their seats and listened to the roaring, creaking around them. When this interruption eased, Taraza raised her voice.\n \"If we survive this damnable machine and get down to Gammu, you must go aside with Dar there, Miles. You have seen the Atreides Manifesto. She will tell you about it and prepare you. That is all.\"\n Teg turned and looked at Odrade. Once more, her features tugged at his memories: a remarkable likeness to Lucilla, but there was something else. He put this aside. The Atreides Manifesto? He had read it because it came to him from Taraza with instructions that he do so. Prepare me? For what?\n Odrade saw the questioning look on Teg\u0027s face. Now, she understood Taraza\u0027s motive. The Mother Superior\u0027s orders took on a new meaning as did words from the Manifesto itself.\n \"Just as the universe is created by the participation of consciousness, the prescient human carries that creative faculty to its ultimate extreme. This was the profoundly misunderstood power of the Atreides bastard, the power that he transmitted to his son, the Tyrant.\"\n Odrade knew those words with an author\u0027s intimacy but they came back to her now as though she had never before encountered them.\n Damn you, Tar! Odrade thought. What if you\u0027re wrong?\n At the quantum level our universe can be seen as an indeterminate place, predictable in a statistical way only when you employ large enough numbers. Between that universe and a relatively predictable one where the passage of a single planet can be timed to a picosecond, other forces come into play. For the in-between universe where we find our daily lives, that which you believe is a dominant force. Your beliefs order the unfolding of daily events. If enough of us believe, a new thing can be made to exist. Belief structure creates a filter through which chaos is sifted into order.\n - Analysis of the Tyrant, the Taraza File: BG Archives\n Teg\u0027s thoughts were in turmoil as he returned to Gammu from the Guildship. He stepped from the lighter at the black-charred edge of the Keep\u0027s private landing field and looked around him as though for the first time. Almost noon. So little time had passed and so much had changed.\n To what extent would the Bene Gesserit go in imparting an essential lesson? he wondered. Taraza had dislodged him from his familiar Mentat processes. He felt that the whole incident on the Guildship had been staged just for him. He had been shaken from a predictable course. How strange Gammu appeared as he crossed the guarded strip to the entry pits.\n Teg had seen many planets, learned their ways and how they printed themselves on their inhabitants. Some planets had a big yellow sun that sat in close and kept living things warm, evolving, growing. Some planets had little shimmer-suns that hung far away in a dark sky, and their light touched very little. Variations existed within and even outside this range. Gammu was a yellow-green variation with a day of 31.27 standard hours and a 2.6 SY. Teg had thought he knew Gammu.\n When the Harkonnens were forced to abandon it, colonists left behind by the Scattering came from the Danian group, calling it by the Halleck name given to it in the great remapping. The colonists had been known as Caladanian in those days but millennia tended to shorten some labels.\n Teg paused at the entryway to the protective revetments that led from the field down beneath the Keep. Taraza and her party lagged behind him. He saw Taraza was talking intently to Odrade.\n Atreides Manifesto, he thought.\n Even on Gammu, few admitted to either Harkonnen or Atreides ancestry, although the genotypes were visible here - especially the dominant Atreides: those long, sharp noses, the high foreheads and sensual mouths. Often, the pieces were scattered - the mouth on one face, those piercing eyes on another and countless mixtures. Sometimes, though, one person carried it all and then you saw the pride, that inner knowledge:\n \"I am one of them!\"\n Gammu\u0027s natives recognized it and gave it walkway room but few labeled it.\n Underlying all of this was what the Harkonnens had left behind - genetic lines tracing far away into the dawn times of Greek and Pathan and Mameluke, shadows of ancient history that few outside of professional historians or those trained by the Bene Gesserit could even name.\n Taraza and her party caught up with Teg. He heard her say to Odrade: \"You must tell Miles all of it.\"\n Very well, she would tell him, he thought. He turned and led the way past the inner guards to the long passage under the pillboxes into the Keep proper.\n Damn the Bene Gesserit! he thought. What were they really doing here on Gammu?\n Plenty of Bene Gesserit signs could be seen on this planet: the back-breeding to fix selected traits, and here and there a visible emphasis on seductive eyes for women.\n Teg returned a guard captain\u0027s salute without changing focus. Seductive eyes, yes. He had seen this soon after his arrival at the ghola\u0027s Keep and especially during his first inspection tour of the planet. He had seen himself in many faces, too, and recalled the thing old Patrin had mentioned so many times.\n \"You have the Gammu look, Bashar.\"\n Seductive eyes! That guard captain back there had them. She and Odrade and Lucilla were alike in this. Few people paid much attention to the importance of eyes when it came to seduction, he thought. It took a Bene Gesserit upbringing to make that point. Big breasts in a woman and hard loins in a man (that tightly muscular look to the buttocks) - these were naturally important in sexual matchings. But without the eyes, the rest of it could go for nothing. Eyes were essential. You could drown in the right kind of eyes, he had learned, sink right into them and be unaware of what was being done to you until penis was firmly clasped in vagina.\n He had noted Lucilla\u0027s eyes immediately after his arrival on Gammu and had walked cautiously. No doubts about how the Sisterhood used her talents!\n There was Lucilla now, waiting at the central inspection and decontamination chamber. She gave him the flickering handsign that all was well with the ghola. Teg relaxed and watched as Lucilla and Odrade confronted each other. The two women had remarkably similar features despite the age difference. Their bodies were quite different, though, Lucilla more solid against Odrade\u0027s willowy form.\n The guard captain of the seductive eyes came up beside Teg and leaned close to him. \"Schwangyu has just learned who you brought back with you,\" she said, nodding toward Taraza. \"Ahhh, there she is now.\"\n Schwangyu stepped from a lift tube and crossed to Taraza, giving only an angry glare to Teg.\n Taraza wanted to surprise you, he thought. We all know why.\n \"You don\u0027t appear happy to see me,\" Taraza said, addressing Schwangyu.\n \"I am surprised, Mother Superior,\" Schwangyu said. \"I had no idea.\" She glanced once more at Teg, a look of venom in her eyes.\n Odrade and Lucilla broke off their mutual examination. \"I had heard about it, of course,\" Odrade said, \"but it is a stopper to confront yourself in the face of another person.\"\n \"I warned you,\" Taraza said.\n \"What are your orders, Mother Superior?\" Schwangyu asked. It was as close as she could come to asking the purpose of Taraza\u0027s visit.\n \"I would like a private word with Lucilla,\" Taraza said.\n \"I\u0027ll have quarters prepared for you,\" Schwangyu said.\n \"Don\u0027t bother,\" Taraza said. \"I\u0027m not staying. Miles has already arranged for my transport. Duty requires my presence at Chapter House. Lucilla and I will talk outside in the courtyard.\" Taraza put a finger to her cheek. \"Oh, and I\u0027d like to watch the ghola unobserved for a few minutes. I\u0027m sure Lucilla can arrange it.\"\n \"He\u0027s taking the more intense training quite well,\" Lucilla said as the two moved off toward a lift tube.\n Teg turned his attention to Odrade, noting as his gaze passed across Schwangyu\u0027s face the intensity of her anger. She was not trying to conceal it.\n Was Lucilla a sister or a daughter of Odrade? Teg wondered. It occurred to him suddenly that there must be a Bene Gesserit purpose behind the resemblance. Yes, of course - Lucilla was an Imprinter!\n Schwangyu overcame her anger. She looked with curiosity at Odrade. \"I was just about to take lunch, Sister,\" Schwangyu said. \"Would you care to join me?\"\n \"I must have a word alone with the Bashar,\" Odrade said. \"If it is all right, perhaps we could remain here for our talk? I must not be seen by the ghola.\"\n Schwangyu scowled, not trying to hide her upset from Odrade. They knew at Chapter House where loyalties lay! But no one... no one! would remove her from this post of observational command. Opposition had its rights!\n Her thoughts were clear even to Teg. He noted the stiffness of Schwangyu\u0027s back as she left them.\n \"It is bad When Sister is turned against Sister,\" Odrade said.\n Teg gave a handsign to his guard captain, ordering her to clear the area. Alone, Odrade said. Alone it would be. To Odrade, he said: \"This is one of my areas. No spies or other means of observing us here.\"\n \"I thought as much,\" Odrade said.\n \"We have a service room over there.\" Teg nodded to his left. \"Furniture, even chairdogs if you prefer.\"\n \"I hate it when they try to cuddle me,\" she said. \"Could we talk here?\" She put a hand under Teg\u0027s arm. \"Perhaps we could walk a bit. I got so stiff sitting in that lighter.\"\n \"What is it you\u0027re supposed to tell me?\" he asked as they strolled.\n \"My memories are no longer selectively filtered,\" she said. \"I have them all, only on the female side, naturally.\"\n \"So?\" Teg pursed his lips. This was not the overture he had expected. Odrade appeared more like one who would take off on a direct approach.\n \"Taraza says you have read the Atreides Manifesto. Good. You know it will cause upset in many quarters.\"\n \"Schwangyu already has made it the subject of a diatribe against \u0027you Atreides.\u0027 \"\n Odrade stared at him solemnly. As the reports all said, Teg remained an imposing figure, but she had known that without the reports.\n \"We are both Atreides, you and I,\" Odrade said.\n Teg came to full alert.\n \"Your mother explained that to you in detail,\" Odrade said, \"when you took your first school leave back to Lernaeus.\"\n Teg stopped and stared down at her. How could she know this? To his knowledge, he had never before met and conversed with this remote Darwi Odrade. Was he the subject of special discussions at Chapter House? He held his silence, forcing her to carry the conversation.\n \"I will recount a conversation between a man and my birthmother,\" Odrade said. \"They are in bed and the man says: \u0027I fathered a few children when I first escaped from the close bondage of the Bene Gesserit, back when I thought myself an independent agent, free to enlist and fight anywhere I chose.\u0027 \"\n Teg did not try to conceal his surprise. Those were his own words! Mentat memory told him Odrade had them down as accurately as a mechanical recorder. Even the tone!\n \"More?\" she asked as he continued to stare at her. \"Very well. The man says: \u0027That was before they sent me to Mentat training, of course. What an eye-opener that was! I had never been out of the Sisterhood\u0027s sight for an instant! I was never a free agent.\u0027 \"\n \"Not even when I spoke those words,\" Teg said.\n \"True.\" She urged him by pressure on his arm as they continued their stroll across the chamber. \"The children you fathered all belonged to the Bene Gesserit. The Sisterhood takes no chances that our genotype will be sent into the wild gene pool.\"\n \"Let my body go to Shaitan, their precious genotype remains in Sisterhood care,\" he said.\n \"My care,\" Odrade said. \"I am one of your daughters.\"\n Again, he forced her to stop.\n \"I think you know who my mother was,\" she said. She held up a hand for silence as he started to respond. \"Names are not necessary.\"\n Teg studied Odrade\u0027s features, seeing the recognizable signs there. Mother and daughter were matched. But what of Lucilla?\n As though she heard his question, Odrade said: \"Lucilla is from a parallel breeding line. Quite remarkable, isn\u0027t it, what careful breed-matching can achieve?\"\n Teg cleared his throat. He felt no emotional attachment to this newly revealed daughter. Her words and other important signals of her performance demanded his primary attention.\n \"This is no casual conversation,\" he said. \"Is this all of what you were to reveal to me? I thought the Mother Superior said...\"\n \"There is more,\" Odrade agreed. \"The Manifesto - I am its author. I wrote it at Taraza\u0027s orders and following her detailed instructions.\"\n Teg glanced around the large chamber as though to make sure no one overheard. He spoke in a lowered voice: \"The Tleilaxu are spreading it far and wide!\"\n \"Just as we hoped.\"\n \"Why are you telling me this? Taraza said you were to prepare me for...\"\n \"There will come a time when you must know our purpose. It is Taraza\u0027s wish that you make your own decisions then, that you really become a free agent.\"\n Even as she spoke, Odrade saw the Mentat glaze in his eyes.\n Teg breathed deeply. Dependencies and key logs! He felt the Mentat sense of an enormous pattern just beyond the reach of his accumulated data. He did not even consider for an instant that some form of filial devotion had prompted these revelations. There was a fundamentalist, dogmatic, and ritualistic essence apparent in all Bene Gesserit training despite every effort to prevent this. Odrade, this daughter out of his past, was a full Reverend Mother with extraordinary powers of muscle and nerve control - full memories on the female side! She was one of the special ones! She knew tricks of violence that few humans ever suspected. Still, that similarity, that essence remained and a Mentat always saw it.\n What does she want?\n Affirmation of his paternity? She already had all of the confirmation she could need.\n Observing her now, the way she waited so patiently for his thoughts to resolve, Teg reflected that it often was said with truth that Reverend Mothers no longer were completely members of the human race. They moved somehow outside the main flow, perhaps parallel to it, perhaps diving into it occasionally for their own purposes, but always removed from humankind. They removed themselves. It was an identifying mark of the Reverend Mother, a sense of extra identity that made them closer to the long-dead Tyrant than to the human stock from which they sprang.\n Manipulation. That was their mark. They manipulated everyone and everything.\n \"I am to be the Bene Gesserit eyes,\" Teg said. \"Taraza wants me to make a human decision for all of you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-8.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) \n With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
