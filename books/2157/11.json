{"id":97399,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Her plan had been simple in the extreme. Complete the Imprint on the ghola and then, registering her intent with Taraza, conceive a child by the redoubtable Miles Teg. Practical introductory seduction had been indicated, but Teg had not succumbed. His Mentat cynicism stopped her one afternoon in the dressing chamber off the Weapons Room. \"My breeding days are over, Lucilla. The Sisterhood should be satisfied with what I already have given.\" Teg, clad only in black exercise leotards, finished wiping his sweaty face with a towel and dropped the towel into a hamper. He spoke without looking at her: \"Would you please leave me now?\" So he saw through her overtures! She should have anticipated that, Teg being who he was. Lucilla knew she might still seduce him. No Reverend Mother of her training should fail, not even with a Mentat of Teg\u0027s obvious powers. Lucilla stood there a moment undecided, her mind automatically planning how to circumvent this preliminary rejection. Something stopped her. Not anger at the rejection, not the remote possibility that he might indeed be proof against her wiles. Pride and its possible fall (there was always that possibility) had little to do with it. Dignity. There was a quiet dignity in Teg and she had the certain knowledge of what his courage and prowess had already given to the Sisterhood. Not quite sure of her motives, Lucilla turned away from him. Possibly it was the underlying gratitude that the Sisterhood felt toward him. To seduce Teg now would be demeaning, not only of him but of herself. She could not bring herself to such an action, not without a direct order from a superior. As she stood on the parapet, some of these memories clouded her senses. There was movement in the shadows at the doorway from the Weapons Wing. Teg could be glimpsed there. Lucilla took a firmer grip on her responses and focused on Duncan. The ghola had stopped his controlled tumbling across the lawn. He stood quietly, breathing deeply, his attention aimed upward at Lucilla. She saw perspiration on his face and in dark blotchings on his light blue singlesuit. Leaning over the parapet, Lucilla called down to him: \"That was very good, Duncan. Tomorrow, I will begin teaching you more of the foot-fist combinations.\" The words came out of her without censoring and she knew their source at once. They were for Teg standing in the shadowed doorway down there, not for the ghola. She was saying to Teg: \"See! You aren\u0027t the only one who teaches him deadly abilities.\" Lucilla realized then that Teg had insinuated himself further into her psyche than she should permit. Grimly, she swung her gaze to the tall figure emerging from the doorway\u0027s shadows. Duncan already was running toward the Bashar. As Lucilla focused on Teg, reaction flashed through her ignited by the most elemental Bene Gesserit responses. The steps of this reaction could be defined later: Something wrong! Danger! Teg is not Teg! In the reactive flash, however, none of this took separate form. She responded, hurling all the volume of Voice she could muster: \"Duncan! Down!\" Duncan dropped flat on the grass, his attention riveted to the Teg-figure emerging from the Weapons Wing. There was a field-model lasgun in the man\u0027s hands. Face Dancer! Lucilla thought. Only hyperalertness revealed him to her. One of the new ones! \"Face Dancer!\" Lucilla shouted. Duncan kicked himself sideways and leaped up, twisting flat in the air at least a meter off the ground. The speed of his reaction shocked Lucilla. She had not known any human could move that fast! The lasgun\u0027s first bolt cut beneath Duncan as he seemed to float in the air. Lucilla jumped to the parapet and dropped to a handhold on the window ledge of the next lower level. Before she was stopped, her right hand shot out and found the protruding rainspout that memory told her was there. Her body arched sideways and she dropped to a window ledge at the next level. Desperation drove her even though she knew she would be too late. Something crackled on the wall above her. She saw a molten line cut toward her as she flung herself to the left, twisting and dropping onto the lawn. Her gaze captured the scene around her in a flashing deit-grasp as she landed. Duncan moved toward the attacker, dodging and twisting in a terrifying replay of his practice session. The speed of his movements! Lucilla saw indecision in the face of the false Teg. She darted toward the Face Dancer, feeling the creature\u0027s thoughts: Two of them after me! Failure was inevitable, though, and Lucilla knew it even as she ran. The Face Dancer had only to shift his weapon into full burn at close range. He could lace the air in front of him. Nothing could penetrate such a defense. As she cast about in her mind, desperately seeking some way to defeat the attacker, she saw red smoke appear on the false Teg\u0027s breast. A line of red darted upward at an oblique angle through the muscles of the arm holding the lasgun. The arm fell away like a piece dropping from a statue. The shoulder tipped away from the torso in a spout of blood. The figure toppled, dissolving into more red smoke and blood spray, crumbling into pieces on the steps, all dark tans and blue-tinged reds. Lucilla smelled the distinctive Face Dancer pheromones as she stopped. Duncan came up beside her. He peered past the dead Face Dancer at movement in the hallway. Another Teg emerged behind the dead one. Lucilla identified the reality: Teg himself. \"That\u0027s the Bashar,\" Duncan said. Lucilla experienced a small surge of pleasure that Duncan had learned this identity-lesson so well: how to recognize your friends even if you only saw bits of them. She pointed to the dead Face Dancer. \"Smell him.\" Duncan inhaled. \"Yes, I have it. But he wasn\u0027t a very good copy. I saw what he was as soon as you did.\" Teg emerged into the courtyard carrying a heavy lasgun cradled across his left arm. His right hand held a firm grip on the stock and trigger. He swept his gaze around the courtyard, then focused on Duncan and finally on Lucilla. \"Bring Duncan inside,\" Teg said. It was the order of a battlefield commander, depending only on superior knowledge of what should be done in the emergency. Lucilla obeyed without question. Duncan did not speak as she led him by the hand past the bloody meat that had been the Face Dancer, then into the Weapons Wing. Once inside, he glanced back at the sodden heap and asked: \"Who let him in?\" Not: \"How did he get in?\" she observed. Duncan already had seen past the inconsequentials to the heart of their problem. Teg strode ahead of them toward his own quarters. He stopped at the door, glanced inside and motioned for Lucilla and Duncan to follow. In Teg\u0027s bedroom there was the thick smell of burned flesh and wisps of smoke dominated by the charred barbecue odor that Lucilla so detested: cooked human meat! A figure in one of Teg\u0027s uniforms lay face down on the floor where it had fallen off his bed. Teg rolled the figure over with one boot toe, exposing the face: staring eyes, a rictus grin. Lucilla recognized one of the perimeter guards, one of those who had come to the Keep with Schwangyu, so the Keep\u0027s records said. \"Their point man,\" Teg said. \"Patrin took care of him and we put one of my uniforms on him. It was enough to fool the Face Dancers because we didn\u0027t let them see the face before we attacked. They didn\u0027t have time to make a memory print.\" \"You know about that?\" Lucilla was startled. \"Bellonda briefed me thoroughly!\" Abruptly, Lucilla saw the further significance of what Teg said. She suppressed a swift flare of anger. \"How did you let one of them get into the courtyard?\" His voice mild, Teg said: \"There was rather urgent activity in here. I had to make a choice, which turned out to be the right one.\" She did not try to hide her anger. \"The choice to let Duncan fend for himself?\" \"To leave him in your care or let other attackers get themselves firmly entrenched inside. Patrin and I had a bad time clearing this wing. We had our hands full.\" Teg glanced at Duncan. \"He came through very well, thanks to our training.\" \"That... that thing almost got him!\" \"Lucilla!\" Teg shook his head. \"I had it timed. You two could last at least a minute out there. I knew you would throw yourself in that thing\u0027s path and sacrifice yourself to save Duncan. Another twenty seconds.\" At Teg\u0027s words, Duncan turned a shiny-eyed look on Lucilla. \"Would you have done that?\" When Lucilla did not respond, Teg said: \"She would have done that. \" Lucilla did not deny it. She remembered now, though, the incredible speed with which Duncan had moved, the dazzling shifts of his attack. \"Battle decisions,\" Teg said, looking at Lucilla. She accepted this. As usual, Teg had made the correct choice. She knew, though, that she would have to communicate with Taraza. The prana-bindu accelerations in this ghola went beyond anything she had expected. She stiffened as Teg straightened to full alert, his gaze on the doorway behind her. Lucilla whirled. Schwangyu stood there, Patrin behind her, another heavy lasgun over his arm. Its muzzle, Lucilla noted, was aimed at Schwangyu. \"She insisted,\" Patrin said. There was an angry set to the old aide\u0027s face. The deep lines beside his mouth pointed downward. \"There\u0027s a trail of bodies clear out to the south pillbox,\" Schwangyu said. \"Your people won\u0027t let me out there to inspect. I command you to countermand those orders immediately.\" \"Not until my clean-up crews are finished,\" Teg said. \"They\u0027re still killing people out there! I can hear it!\" A venomous edge had entered Schwangyu\u0027s voice. She glared at Lucilla. \"We\u0027re also questioning people out there,\" Teg said. Schwangyu shifted her glare to Teg. \"If it\u0027s too dangerous here then we will take the... the child to my quarters. Now!\" \"We will not do that,\" Teg said. His tone was low-key but positive. Schwangyu stiffened with displeasure. Patrin\u0027s knuckles went white on the stock of his lasgun. Schwangyu swung her gaze past the gun and up to Lucilla\u0027s appraising stare. The two women looked into each other\u0027s eyes. Teg allowed the moment to hold for a beat, then said: \"Lucilla, take Duncan into my sitting room.\" He nodded toward a door behind him. Lucilla obeyed, pointedly keeping her body between Schwangyu and Duncan the whole time. Once behind the closed door, Duncan said: \"She almost called me \u0027the ghola.\u0027 She\u0027s really upset.\" \"Schwangyu has let several things slip past her guard,\" Lucilla said. She glanced around Teg\u0027s sitting room, her first view of this part of his quarters: the Bashar\u0027s inner sanctum. It reminded her of her own quarters - that same mixture of orderliness and casual disarray. Reading spools lay in a clutter on a small table beside an old-fashioned chair upholstered in soft gray. The spool reader had been swung aside as though its user had just stepped out for a moment, intending to return soon. A Bashar\u0027s black uniform jacket lay across a nearby hard chair with sewing material in a small open box atop it. The jacket\u0027s cuff showed a carefully patched hole. So he does his own mending. This was an aspect of the famous Miles Teg she had not expected. If she had thought about it, she would have said Patrin would absorb such chores. \"Schwangyu let the attackers in, didn\u0027t she?\" Duncan asked. \"Her people did.\" Lucilla did not hide her anger. \"She has gone too far. A pact with the Tleilaxu!\" \"Will Patrin kill her?\" \"I don\u0027t know nor do I care!\" Outside the door, Schwangyu spoke with anger, her voice loud and quite clear: \"Are we just going to wait here, Bashar?\" \"You can leave anytime you wish.\" That was Teg. \"But I can\u0027t enter the south tunnel!\" Schwangyu sounded petulant. Lucilla knew it for something the old woman did deliberately. What was she planning? Teg must be very cautious now. He had been clever out there, revealing for Lucilla the gaps in Schwangyu\u0027s control, but they had not plumbed Schwangyu\u0027s resources. Lucilla wondered if she should leave Duncan here and return to Teg\u0027s side. Teg said: \"You can go now but I advise you not to return to your quarters.\" \"And why not?\" Schwangyu sounded surprised, really surprised and not covering it well. \"One moment,\" Teg said. Lucilla became aware of shouting at a distance. A heavy thumping explosion sounded from nearby and then another one more distant. Dust sifted from the cornice above the door to Teg\u0027s sitting room. \"What was that?\" Schwangyu again, her voice overly loud. Lucilla moved to place herself between Duncan and the wall to the hallway. Duncan stared at the door, his body poised for defense. \"That first blast was what I expected them to do.\" Teg again. \"The second, I fear, was what they did not expect.\" A whistle piped nearby loud enough to cover something Schwangyu said. \"That\u0027s it Bashar!\" Patrin. \"What is happening?\" Schwangyu demanded. \"The first explosion, dear Reverend Mother, was your quarters being destroyed by our attackers. The second explosion was us destroying the attackers.\" \"I just got the signal, Bashar!\" Patrin again. \"We got them all. They came down by floater from the no-ship just as you expected.\" \"The ship?\" Teg\u0027s voice was full of angry demand. \"Destroyed the instant it came through the space fold. No survivors.\" \"You fools!\" Schwangyu screamed. \"Do you know what you\u0027ve done?\" \"I carried out my orders to protect that boy from any attack,\" Teg said. \"By the way, weren\u0027t you supposed to be in your quarters at this hour?\" \"What?\" \"They were after you when they blasted your quarters. The Tleilaxu are very dangerous, Reverend Mother.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you!\" \"I suggest you go look. Patrin, let her pass.\" As she listened, Lucilla heard the unspoken argument. The Mentat Bashar had been trusted here more than a Reverend Mother and Schwangyu knew it. She would be desperate. That was clever, suggesting her quarters had been destroyed. She might not believe it, though. Foremost in Schwangyu\u0027s mind now would be the realization that both Teg and Lucilla recognized her complicity in the attack. There was no telling how many others were aware of this. Patrin knew, of course. Duncan stared at the closed door, his head tipped slightly to the right. There was a curious expression on his face, as though he saw through the door and actually watched the people out there. Schwangyu spoke, the most careful control in her voice. \"I don\u0027t believe my quarters were destroyed.\" She knew Lucilla was listening. \"There is only one way to make sure,\" Teg said. Clever! Lucilla thought. Schwangyu could not make a decision until she was certain whether the Tleilaxu had acted treacherously. \"You will wait here for me, then! That\u0027s an order!\" Lucilla heard the swish of Schwangyu\u0027s robes as the Reverend Mother departed. Very bad emotional control, Lucilla thought. What this revealed about Teg, though, was equally disturbing. He did it to her! Teg had kept a Reverend Mother off balance. The door in front of Duncan swung open. Teg stood there, one hand on the latch. \"Quick!\" Teg said. \"We must be out of the Keep before she returns.\" \"Out of the Keep?\" Lucilla did not hide her shock. \"Quick, I say! Patrin has prepared a way for us.\" \"But I must -\" \"You must nothing! Come as you are. Follow me or we will be forced to take you.\" \"Do you really think you could take a...\" Lucilla broke off. This was a new Teg in front of her and she knew he would not have made such a threat unless he was prepared to carry it out. \"Very well,\" she said. She took Duncan\u0027s hand and followed Teg out of his quarters. Patrin stood in the hallway looking to his right. \"She\u0027s gone,\" the old man said. He looked at Teg. \"You know what to do, Bashar?\" \"Pat!\" Lucilla had never before heard Teg use the batman\u0027s diminutive name. Patrin grinned, a gleaming full-toothed smile. \"Sorry, Bashar. The excitement, you know. I\u0027ll leave you to it, then. I have my part to play.\" Teg waved Lucilla and Duncan down the hallway to the right. She obeyed and heard Teg close on her heels. Duncan\u0027s hand was sweaty in her hand. He pulled free and strode beside her without looking back. The suspensor-drop at the end of the hallway was guarded by two of Teg\u0027s own people. He nodded to them. \"Nobody follows.\" They spoke in unison: \"Right, Bashar.\" Lucilla realized as she entered the drop with Duncan and Teg that she had chosen sides in a dispute whose workings she did not fully understand. She could feel the movements of the Sisterhood\u0027s politics like a swift current of water pouring all around her. Usually, the movement remained mostly a gentle wave washing the strand, but now she sensed a great destructive surge preparing to thunder its surf upon her. Duncan spoke as they emerged into the sorting chamber for the south pillbox. \"We should all be armed,\" he said. \"We will be very soon,\" Teg said. \"And I hope you\u0027re prepared to kill anyone who tries to stop us.\" The significant fact is this: No Bene Tleilax female has ever been seen away from the protection of their core planets. (Face Dancer mules who simulate females do not count in this analysis. They cannot be breeders.) The Tleilaxu sequester their females to keep them from our hands. This is our primary deduction. It must also be in the eggs that the Tleilaxu Masters conceal their most essential secrets. - Bene Gesserit Analysis - Archives #XOXTM99.... 041 \"So we meet at last,\" Taraza said. She stared across the two meters of open space between their chairs at Tylwyth Waff. Her analysts assured her that this man was Tleilaxu Master of Masters. What an elfin little figure he was to hold so much power. The prejudices of appearance must be discarded here, she warned herself. \"Some would not believe this possible,\" Waff said. He had a piping little voice, Taraza noted; something else to be measured by different standards. They sat in the neutrality of a Guild no-ship with Bene Gesserit and Tleilaxu monitors clinging to the Guildship\u0027s hull like predatory birds on a carcass. (The Guild had been cravenly anxious to placate the Bene Gesserit. \"You will pay.\" The Guild knew. Payment had been exacted from them before.) The small oval room in which they met was conventionally copper-walled and \"spy-proof.\" Taraza did not believe this for an instant. She presumed also that the bonds between Guild and Tleilaxu, forged of melange, still existed in full force. Waff did not try to delude himself about Taraza. This woman was far more dangerous than any Honored Matre. If he killed Taraza, she would be replaced immediately by someone just as dangerous, someone with every essential piece of information possessed by the present Mother Superior. \"We find your new Face Dancers very interesting,\" Taraza said. Waff grimaced involuntarily. Yes, far more dangerous than the Honored Matres, who were not yet even blaming the Tleilaxu for the loss of an entire no-ship. Taraza glanced at the small double-faced digital clock on the low side table at her right, a position where the clock could be read easily by either of them. The Waff-side face had been matched to his internal clock. She noted that the two internal-time readings stood within ten seconds of synchronization at an arbitrary midafternoon. It was one of the niceties of this confrontation where even the positioning and spacing between their chairs had been specified in the arrangements. The two of them were alone in the room. The oval space around them was about six meters in its long dimension, half that in width. They occupied identical sling chairs of peg-fastened wood, which supported orange fabric; not a bit of metal or other foreign material in either of them. The only other furnishing of the room was the side table with its clock. The table was a thin black surface of plaz on three spindly wooden legs. Each of the principals in this meeting had been snooped with care. Each had three personal guards outside the room\u0027s one hatch. Taraza did not think the Tleilaxu would try a Face Dancer exchange, not under the present circumstances! \"You will pay.\" The Tleilaxu, too, were extremely aware of their vulnerability, especially now that they knew a Reverend Mother could expose the new Face Dancers. Waff cleared his throat. \"I do not expect us to reach an agreement,\" he said. \"Then why did you come?\" \"I seek an explanation of this odd message we have received from your Keep on Rakis. For what are we supposed to pay?\" \"I beg of you, Ser Waff, drop these foolish pretenses in this room. There are facts known to both of us that cannot be avoided.\" \"Such as?\" \"No female of the Bene Tleilax has ever been provided to us for breeding.\" And she thought: Let him sweat that one! It was damnably frustrating not to have a line of Tleilaxu Other Memories for Bene Gesserit investigation and Waff would know it. Waff scowled. \"Surely you don\u0027t think I would bargain with the life of -\" He broke off and shook his head. \"I cannot believe this is the payment you would ask.\" When Taraza did not respond, Waff said: \"The stupid attack on the Rakian temple was undertaken independently by people on the scene. They have been punished.\" Expected gambit number three, Taraza thought. She had participated in numerous analysis-briefings before this meeting, if one could call them briefings. Analyses there had been in excess. Very little was known about this Tleilaxu Master, this Tylwyth Waff. Some extremely important optional projections had been arrived at by inference (if these proved to be true). The trouble was that some of the most interesting data came from unreliable sources. One salient fact could be depended upon, however: The elfin figure seated across from her was deadly dangerous. Waff\u0027s gambit number three engaged her attention. It was time to respond. Taraza produced a knowing smile. \"That is precisely the kind of lie we expected from you,\" she said. \"Do we begin with insults?\" He spoke without heat. \"You set the pattern. Let me warn you that you will not be able to deal with us the way you dealt with those whores from the Scattering.\" Waff\u0027s frozen stare invited Taraza to a daring gambit. The Sisterhood\u0027s deductions, based partly on the disappearance of an Ixian conference ship, were accurate! Maintaining her same smile, she now pursued the optional conjecture line as though it were known fact. \"I think,\" she said, \"the whores might like to learn that they have had Face Dancers among them.\" Waff suppressed his anger. These damnable witches! They knew! Somehow, they knew! His councillors had been extremely doubtful about this meeting. A substantial minority had recommended against it. The witches were so... so devilish. And their retaliations! Time to shift his attention to Gammu, Taraza thought. Keep him off balance. She said: \"Even when you subvert one of us, as you did with Schwangyu on Gammu, you learn nothing of value!\" Waff flared: \"She thought to... to hire us like a band of assassins! We only taught her a lesson!\" Ahhhh, his pride shows itself, Taraza thought. Interesting. The implications of a moral structure behind such pride must be explored. \"You\u0027ve never really penetrated our ranks,\" Taraza said. \"And you have never penetrated the Tleilaxu!\" Waff managed to produce this boast with passable calm. He needed time to think! To plan! \"Perhaps you would like to know the price of our silence,\" Taraza suggested. She took Waff\u0027s stony glare for agreement and added: \"For one thing, you will share with us everything you learn about those Scattering-spawned whores who call themselves Honored Matres.\" Waff shuddered. Much had been confirmed by killing the Honored Matres. The sexual intricacies! Only the strongest psyche could resist entanglement in such ecstasies. The potential of this tool was enormous! Must that be shared with these witches? \"Everything you learn from them,\" Taraza insisted. \"Why do you call them whores?\" \"They try to copy us, yet they sell themselves for power and make a mockery of everything we represent. Honored Matres!\" \"They outnumber you at least ten thousand to one! We have seen the evidence.\" \"One of us could defeat them all,\" Taraza said. Waff sat in silence, studying her. Was that merely a boast? You could never be sure when it came to the Bene Gesserit witches. They did things. The dark side of the magic universe belonged to them. On more than one occasion the witches had blunted the Shariat. Was it God\u0027s will that the true believers pass through another trial? Taraza allowed the silence to continue building its own tensions. She sensed Waff\u0027s turmoil. It reminded her of the Sisterhood\u0027s preliminary conference in preparation for this meeting with him. Bellonda had asked the question of deceptive simplicity: \"What do we really know about the Tleilaxu?\" Taraza had felt the answer surge into every mind around the Chapter House conference table: We may know for sure only what they want us to know. None of her analysts could avoid the suspicion that the Tleilaxu had deliberately created a masking-image of themselves. Tleilaxu intelligence had to be measured against the fact that they alone controlled the secret of the axlotl tanks. Was that a lucky accident as some suggested? Then why had others been unable to duplicate this accomplishment in all of these millennia? Gholas. Were the Tleilaxu using the ghola process for their own kind of immortality? She could see suggestive hints in Waff\u0027s actions... nothing definite but highly suspicious. At the Chapter House conferences, Bellonda had returned repeatedly to their basic suspicions, hammering at them: \"All of it... all of it, I say! Everything in our archives could be garbage fit only for slig fodder!\" This allusion had caused some of the more relaxed Reverend Mothers around the table to shudder. Sligs! Those slowly creeping crosses between giant slugs and pigs might provide meat for some of the most expensive meals in their universe but the creatures themselves embodied everything the Sisterhood held repugnant about the Tleilaxu. Sligs had been one of the earliest Bene Tleilax barter items, a product grown in their tanks and formed with the helical core from which all life took its shapes. That the Bene Tleilax made them added to the aura of obscenity around a creature whose multimouths ground incessantly on almost any garbage, passing that garbage swiftly into excrement that not only smelled of the sty but was slimy. \"The sweetest meat this side of heaven,\" Bellonda had quoted from a CHOAM promotion. \"And it comes from obscenity,\" Taraza had added. Obscenity. Taraza thought of this as she stared at Waff. For what possible reason might people build around themselves a mask of obscenity? Waff\u0027s flare of pride could not be fitted neatly into that image. Waff coughed lightly into his hand. He felt the pressure of the seams where he had concealed two of his potent dart-throwers. The minority among his councillors had advised: \"As with the Honored Matres, the winner in this encounter with the Bene Gesserit will be the one who emerges carrying the most secret information about the other. Death of the opponent guarantees success.\" I might kill her but what then? Three more full Reverend Mothers waited outside that hatch. Doubtless Taraza had a signal prepared for the instant the hatch was opened. Without that signal, violence and disaster were sure to ensue. He did not believe for an instant that even his new Face Dancers could overcome those Reverend Mothers out there. The witches would be on full alert. They would have recognized the nature of Waff\u0027s guards. \"We will share,\" Waff said. The admissions implicit in this hurt him but he knew he had no alternatives. Taraza\u0027s brag about relative abilities might be inaccurate because of its extreme claim, but he sensed truth in it nonetheless. He had no illusions, however, about what would ensue if the Honored Matres learned what had actually happened to their envoys. The missing no-ship could not yet be laid at the Tleilaxu door. Ships did vanish. Deliberate assassination was another matter altogether. The Honored Matres surely would try to exterminate such a brash opponent. If only as an example. Tleilaxu returned from the Scattering said as much. Having seen Honored Matres, Waff now believed those stories. Taraza said: \"My second agenda item for this meeting is our ghola.\" Waff squirmed in the sling chair. Taraza felt repelled by Waff\u0027s tiny eyes, the round face with its snub nose and too-sharp teeth. \"You have been killing our gholas to control the movement of a project in which you have no part other than to provide a single element,\" Taraza accused. Waff once more wondered if he must kill her. Was nothing hidden from these damnable witches? The implication that the Bene Gesserit had a traitor in the Tleilaxu core could not be ignored. How else could they know? He said: \"I assure you, Reverend Mother Superior, that the ghola - \"Assure me of nothing! We assure ourselves.\" A look of sadness on her face, Taraza shook her head slowly from side to side. \"And you think we don\u0027t know that you sold us damaged goods.\" Waff spoke quickly: \"He meets every requirement imposed by your contract!\" Again, Taraza shook her head from side to side. This diminutive Tleilaxu Master had no idea what he was revealing here. \"You have buried your own scheme in his psyche,\" Taraza said. \"I warn you, Ser Waff, that if your alterations obstruct our design, we will wound you deeper than you think possible.\" Waff passed a hand across his face, feeling the perspiration on his forehead. Damnable witches! But she did not know everything. The Tleilaxu returned from the Scattering and the Honored Matres she maligned so bitterly had provided the Tleilaxu with a sexually loaded weapon that would not be shared, no matter the promises made here! Taraza digested Waff\u0027s reactions silently and decided on a bold lie. \"When we captured your Ixian conference ship, your new Face Dancers did not die quite fast enough. We learned a great deal.\" Waff poised himself on the edge of violence. Bullseye! Taraza thought. The bold lie had opened an avenue of revelation into one of the more outrageous suggestions from her advisors. It did not seem outrageous now. \"The Tleilaxu ambition is to produce a complete prana-bindu mimic,\" her advisor had suggested. \"Complete?\" All of the Sisters at the conference had been astonished by the suggestion. It implied a form of mental copy going beyond the memory print about which they already knew. The advisor, Sister Hesterion from Archives, had come armed with a tightly organized list of supporting material. \"We already know that what an Ixian Probe does mechanically, the Tleilaxu do with nerves and flesh. The next step is obvious.\" Seeing Waff\u0027s reaction to her bold lie, Taraza continued to watch him carefully. He was at his most dangerous right now. A look of rage came over Waff\u0027s face. The things the witches knew were too dangerous! He did not doubt Taraza\u0027s claim in the slightest. I must kill her no matter the consequences to me! We must kill them all. Abominations! It\u0027s their word and it describes them perfectly. Taraza correctly interpreted his expression. She spoke quickly: \"You are in absolutely no danger from us as long as you do not injure our designs. Your religion, your way of life, those are your business.\" Waff hesitated, not so much from what Taraza said as from the reminder of her powers. What else did they know? To continue in a subservient position, though! After rejecting such an alliance with the Honored Matres. And with ascendancy so near after all of those millennia. Dismay filled him. The minority among his councillors had been right after all: \"There can be no bond between our peoples. Any accord with powindah forces is a union based upon evil.\" Taraza still sensed the potential violence in him. Had she pushed him too far? She held herself in defensive readiness. An involuntary jerking of his arms alerted her. Weapons in his sleeves! Tleilaxu resources were not to be underestimated. Her snoopers had detected nothing. \"We know about the weapons you carry,\" she said. Another bold lie suggested itself. \"If you make a mistake now, the whores will also learn how you use those weapons.\" Waff took three shallow breaths. When he spoke, he had himself under control: \"We will not be Bene Gesserit satellites!\" Taraza responded in an even-toned, soothing voice: \"I have not by word or action suggested such a role for you.\" She waited.
