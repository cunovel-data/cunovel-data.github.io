{"id":97392,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Is there one among you,\" Waff asked, \"who believes that a single powindah knows how we use the language of God?\" There! Let them think on that! Every one of them here had been wakened time after time in ghola flesh. There was a fleshly continuity in this Council that no other people had ever achieved. Mirlat himself had seen the Prophet with his own eyes. Scytale had spoken to Muad\u0027dib! Learning how the flesh could be renewed and the memories restored, they had condensed this power into a single government whose potency was confined lest it be demanded everywhere. Only the witches had a similar storehouse of experience upon which to draw and they moved with fearful caution, terrified that they might produce another Kwisatz Haderach! Waff said these things to his councillors, adding: \"The time for action has come.\" When no one spoke disagreement, Waff said: \"This manifesto has a single author. Every analysis agrees. Mirlat?\" \"Written by one person and that person a true Atreides, no doubt of it,\" Mirlat agreed. \"All at the powindah conference affirmed this,\" Waff said. \"Even a third-stage Guild steersman agrees.\" \"But that one person has produced a thing that excites violent reactions among diverse peoples,\" Mirlat argued. \"Have we ever questioned the Atreides talent for disruption?\" Waff asked. \"When the powindah showed me this document I knew God had sent us a signal.\" \"Do the witches still deny authorship?\" Torg the Younger asked. How alertly apt he is, Waff thought. \"Every powindah religion is called into question by this manifesto,\" Waff said. \"Every faith except ours is left hanging in limbo.\" \"Exactly the problem!\" Mirlat pounced. \"But only we know this,\" Waff said. \"Who else even suspects the existence of the Shariat?\" \"The Guild,\" Mirlat said. \"They have never spoken of it and they never will. They know what our response would be.\" Waff lifted the sheaf of papers from his lap and again read aloud: \"Forces that we cannot understand permeate our universe. We see the shadows of those forces when they are projected upon a screen available to our senses, but understand them we do not.\" \"The Atreides who wrote that knows of the Shariat,\" Mirlat muttered. Waff continued reading as though there had been no interruption: \"Understanding requires words. Some things cannot be reduced to words. There are things that can only be experienced wordlessly.\" As though he handled a holy relic, Waff returned the document to his lap. Softly, so that his listeners were required to bend toward him and some cupped a hand behind an ear, Waff said: \"This says our universe is magical. It says all arbitrary forms are transient and subject to magical changes. Science has led us to this interpretation as though it placed us on a track from which we cannot deviate.\" He allowed these words to fester for a moment, then: \"No Rakian priest of the Divided God nor any other powindah charlatan can accept that. Only we know it because our God is a magical God whose language we speak.\" \"We will be accused of the authorship,\" Mirlat said. The moment he had spoken, Mirlat shook his head sharply from side to side. \"No! I see it. I see what you mean.\" Waff held his silence. He could see that all of them were reflecting on their Sufi origins, recalling the Great Belief and the Zensunni ecumenism that had spawned the Bene Tleilax. The people of this kehl knew the God-given facts of their origins but generations of secrecy assured that no powindah shared their knowledge. Words flowed silently through Waff\u0027s mind: \"Assumptions based on understanding contain belief in an absolute ground out of which all things spring like plants growing from seeds.\" Knowing that his councillors also recalled this catechism of the Great Belief, Waff reminded them of the Zensunni admonition. \"Behind such assumptions lies a faith in words that the powindah do not question. Only the Shariat question and we do so silently.\" His councillors nodded in unison. Waff inclined his head slightly and continued: \"The act of saying that things exist that cannot be described in words shakes a universe where words are the supreme belief.\" \"Powindah poison!\" his councillors shouted. He had them all now and Waff hammered home his victory by demanding: \"What is the Sufi-Zensunni Credo?\" They could not speak it but all reflected on it: To achieve s\u0027tori no understanding is needed. S\u0027tori exists without words, without even a name. In a moment, all of them looked up and exchanged knowing glances. Mirlat took it upon himself to recite the Tleilaxu pledge: \"I can say God, but that is not my God. That is only a noise and no more potent than any other noise.\" \"I now see,\" Waff said, \"that you all sense the power that has fallen into our hands through this document. Millions upon millions of copies already are being circulated among the powindah.\" \"Who does this?\" Mirlat asked. \"Who cares?\" Waff countered. \"Let the powindah chase after them, seeking their origin, trying to suppress them, preaching against them. With each such action, the powindah inject more power into these words.\" \"Should we not preach against these words, too?\" Mirlat asked. \"Only if the occasion demands it,\" Waff said. \"See you!\" He slapped the papers against his knees. \"The powindah have constricted their awareness to its tightest purpose and that is their weakness. We must insure that this manifesto gains as wide a circulation as possible.\" \"The magic of our God is our only bridge,\" the councillors intoned. All of them, Waff observed, had been restored to the central security of their faith. It had been easily managed. No Masheikh shared the powindah stupidity that whined: \"In thy infinite grace, God, why me?\" In one sentence, the powindah invoked infinity and denied it, never once observing their own foolishness \"Scytale,\" Waff said. The youngest and most baby-faced of the councillors, seated at the far left as was fitting, leaned forward eagerly. \"Arm the faithful,\" Waff said. \"I marvel that an Atreides has given us this weapon,\" Mirlat said. \"How can it be that the Atreides always fasten upon an ideal that enlists the billions who must follow?\" \"It is not the Atreides, it is God,\" Waff said. He lifted his arms then and spoke the closing ritual: \"The Masheikh have met in kehl and felt the presence of their God.\" Waff closed his eyes and waited for the others to leave. Masheikh! How good it was to name themselves in kehl, speaking the language of Islamiyat, which no Tleilaxu spoke outside his own secret councils; not even to Face Dancers did they speak it. Nowhere in the Wekht of Jandola, not to the farthest reaches of the Tleilaxu Yaghist, was there a living powindah who knew this secret. Yaghist, Waff thought, rising from his bench. Yaghist, the land of the unruled. He thought he could feel the document vibrating in his hand. This Atreides Manifesto was the very kind of thing the masses of powindah would follow to their doom. Some days it\u0027s melange; some days it\u0027s bitter dirt. - Rakian Aphorism In her third year with the priests of Rakis, the girl Sheeana lay full length atop a high curving dune. She peered into the morning distance where a great rumbling friction could be heard. The light was a ghostly silver that frosted the horizon with filmy haze. The night\u0027s chill still lay on the sand. She knew the priests were watching her from the safety of their water-girded tower some two kilometers behind her, but this gave her little concern. The trembling of the sand beneath her body demanded full attention. It\u0027s a big one, she thought. Seventy meters at least. A beautiful big one. The gray stillsuit felt slick and smooth against her skin. It had none of the abrasive patches of the old hand-me-down she had worn before the priests took her into their care. She felt thankful for the fine stillsuit and the thick robe of white and purple that covered it, but most of all she felt the excitement of being here. Something rich and dangerous filled her at moments such as this. The priests did not understand what happened here. She knew this. They were cowards. She glanced over her shoulder at the distant tower and saw sunglint on lenses. A precocious child of eleven standard years, slender and dark-skinned with sun-streaked brown hair, she could visualize clearly what the priests saw through their spying lenses. They see me doing what they do not dare. They see me in the path of Shaitan. I look very small on the sand and Shaitan looks very big. They can see him already. From the rasping sound, she knew that she, too, would soon see the giant worm. Sheeana did not think of the approaching monster as Shai-hulud, God of the sands, a thing the priests chanted each morning in obeisance to the pearl of Leto II\u0027s awareness that lay encapsulated in each of the multi-ridged rulers of the desert. She thought of the worms mainly as \"they who spared me,\" or as Shaitan. They belonged to her now. It was a relationship begun slightly more than three years ago during the month of her eighth birthday, the Month Igat by the old calendar. Her village had been a poor one, a pioneer venture built far beyond more secure barriers such as the qanats and ring canals of Keen. Only a moat of damp sand guarded such pioneer places. Shaitan avoided water but the sandtrout vector soon took away any dampness. Precious moisture captured in windtraps had to be expended each day to renew the barrier. Her village was a miserable cluster of shacks and hovels with two small windtraps, adequate for drinking water but with only a sporadic surplus that could be apportioned to the worm barrier. That morning - much like this morning, the night\u0027s chill sharp in her nose and lungs, the horizon constricted by a ghostly haze - most of the village children had fanned out into the desert, there to seek bits and fragments of melange, which Shaitan sometimes left behind in his passage. Two big ones had been heard nearby in the night. Melange, even at modern deflated prices, could buy the glazed bricks to line a third windtrap. Each searching child not only looked for the spice but also sought those signs which would reveal one of the old Fremen sietch strongholds. There were only remnants of such places now but the rock barriers provided a greater security against Shaitan. And some of the remnant sietch places were reputed to contain lost hoards of melange. Every villager dreamed of such a discovery. Sheeana, wearing her patched stillsuit and flimsy robe, went alone to the northeast, toward the faraway smoky mound of air that told of the great city of Keen with its moisture richness lifting into the sun-warmed breezes. Hunting scraps of melange in the sand was largely a matter of focusing attention into the nostrils. It was a form of concentration that left only bits of awareness attuned to the rasping sand that told of Shaitan\u0027s approach. Leg muscles moved automatically in the non-rhythmic walk that blended with the desert\u0027s natural sounds. At first, Sheeana did not hear the screaming. It fitted intimately into the saltated friction of windblown sand across the barracans that concealed the village from her sight. Slowly the sound penetrated her consciousness and then it demanded her attention. Many voices screaming! Sheeana discarded the desert precaution of random strides. Moving swiftly as her childish muscles would carry her, she scrambled up the slipface of the barracan and stared along it toward that terrifying sound. She was in time to see that which cut off the last of the screams. Wind and sandtrout had dried a wide arc of the barrier at the far side of her village. She could see the gap by the color difference. A wild worm had penetrated the opening. It circled close inside the remaining dampness. The gigantic flame-shadowed mouth scooped up people and hovels in a swiftly tightening circle. Sheeana saw the last survivors huddled at the center of this destruction, a space already cleared of its rude hovels and tumbled with the remains of the windtraps. Even as she watched, some of the people tried to break away into the desert. Sheeana recognized her father among the frantic runners. None escaped. The great mouth engulfed all before turning to level the last of the village. Smoking sand remained and nothing else of the puny village that had dared to claim a scrap of Shaitan\u0027s domain. The place where the village had been was as unmarked by human habitation as it had been before anyone walked there. Sheeana took a gasping breath, inhaling through her nose to preserve the moisture of her body as any good child of the desert would do. She scanned the horizon for a sign of the other children but Shaitan\u0027s track had left great curves and loops all around the far side of the village. Not a single human remained in view. She shouted, the high-pitched cry that would carry far through the dry air. No response came back to her. Alone. She moved trancelike along the ridge of the dune toward where her village had been. As she neared the place a great wave of cinnamon odor filled her nostrils, carried on the wind that still dusted the tops of the dunes. She realized then what had happened. The village had been sited disastrously atop a pre-spice blow. As the great hoard far under the sand came to fruition, expanding in an explosion of melange, Shaitan had come. Every child knew Shaitan could not resist a spiceblow. Rage and wild desperation began to fill Sheeana. Mindlessly, she raced down the dune toward Shaitan, coming up behind the worm as it turned back through the dry place where it had entered the village. Without thought, she dashed along beside the tail, scrambled onto it and ran forward along the great ridged back. At the hump behind its mouth, she crouched and beat her fists against the unyielding surface. The worm stopped. Her anger suddenly converted to terror, Sheeana broke off pounding on the worm. She realized only then that she had been screaming. A terrible sense of lonely exposure filled her. She did not know how she had come here. She knew only where she was and this gripped her with an agony of fear. The worm continued quiescent on the sand. Sheeana did not know what to do. At any moment, the worm could roll over and crush her. Or it could burrow beneath the sand, leaving her on the surface to be scooped up at leisure. Abruptly, a long tremor worked its way down the worm\u0027s length from its tail to Sheeana\u0027s position behind the mouth. The worm began to move ahead. It turned in a wide arc and gathered speed on a course to the northeast. Sheeana leaned forward and gripped the leading edge of a ring ridge on the worm\u0027s back. She feared that any second it would slide beneath the sand. What could she do then? But Shaitan did not burrow. As minutes passed without any deviation from that straight and swift passage across the dunes, Sheeana found her mind working once more. She knew about this ride. The priests of the Divided God forbade it but the histories, both written and oral, said Fremen rode thus in the ancient days. Fremen stood tall atop Shaitan\u0027s back supported by slender poles with hooked ends. The priests decreed that this had been done before Leto II shared His consciousness with the God of the desert. Now, nothing was permitted that might demean the scattered bits of Leto II. With a speed that astonished her, the worm carried Sheeana toward the mist-dazzled shape of Keen. The great city lay like a mirage on the distorted horizon. Sheeana\u0027s threadbare robe whipped against the thin surface of her patched stillsuit. Her fingers ached where she gripped the leading edge of the giant ring. The cinnamon, burnt-rock and ozone of the worm\u0027s heat exchange swept over her on shifts in the wind. Keen began to gain definition ahead of her. The priests will see me and be angry, she thought. She identified the low brick structures that marked the first line of qanats and, beyond them, the enclosed barrel-curve of a surface aqueduct. Above these structures rose the walls of terraced gardens and the high profiles of giant windtraps, then the temple complex within its own water barriers. A day\u0027s march across open sand in little more than an hour! Her parents and village neighbors had made this journey many times for trade and to join in the dancing but Sheeana had only accompanied them twice. She remembered mostly the dancing and the violence that followed. The size of Keen filled her with awe. So many buildings! So many people! Shaitan could not harm such a place as that. But the worm plunged straight ahead as though it would ride over qanat and aqueduct. Sheeana stared at the city rising higher and higher in front of her. Fascination subdued her terror. Shaitan was not going to stop! The worm ground to a halt. The tubular surface vents of the qanat lay no more than fifty meters in front of its gaping mouth. She smelled the hot cinnamon exhalations, heard the deep rumblings of Shaitan\u0027s interior furnace. It became apparent to her at last that the journey had ended. Slowly, Sheeana released her grip on the ring. She stood, expecting any moment the worm would renew its motion. Shaitan remained quiescent. Moving cautiously, she slid off her perch and dropped to the sand. She paused there. Would it move now? She held a vague idea of dashing for the qanat but this worm fascinated her. Slipping and sliding in the disturbed sand, Sheeana moved around to the front of the worm and stared into the fearsome mouth. Within the frame of crystal teeth flames rolled forward and backward. A searing exhalation of spice odors swept over her. The madness of that first dash down off the dune and onto the worm came back to Sheeana. \"Damn you, Shaitan!\" she shouted, shaking a fist at the awful mouth. \"What did we ever do to you?\" These were words she had heard her mother use at the destruction of a tuber garden. No part of Sheeana\u0027s awareness had ever questioned that name, Shaitan, nor her mother\u0027s fury. She was of the poorest dregs at the bottom of the Rakian heap and she knew it. Her people believed in Shaitan first and Shai-hulud second. Worms were worms and often much worse. There was no justice on the open sand. Only danger lurked there. Poverty and fear of priests might drive her people onto the perilous dunes but they moved even then with the same angry persistence that had driven the Fremen. This time, however, Shaitan had won. It entered Sheeana\u0027s awareness that she stood in the deadly path. Her thoughts, not yet fully formed, recognized only that she had done a crazy thing. Much later, as the Sisterhood\u0027s teachings rounded her consciousness, she would realize that she had been overcome by the terror of loneliness. She had wanted Shaitan to take her into the company of her dead. A grating sound issued from beneath the worm. Sheeana stifled a scream. Slowly at first, then faster, the worm backed off several meters. It turned there and gathered speed beside the twin-mounded track it had created coming from the desert. The grating of its passage diminished in the distance. Sheeana grew aware of another sound. She lifted her gaze to the sky. The thwock-thwock of a priestly ornithopter swept over her, brushing her with its shadow. The craft glistened in the morning sunlight as it followed the worm into the desert. Sheeana felt a more familiar fear then. The priests! She kept her gaze on the \u0027thopter. It hovered in the distance, then returned to settle gently onto a patch of worm-smoothed sand nearby. She could smell the lubricants and the sickly acridity of the \u0027thopter\u0027s fuel. The thing was a giant insect nestled on the sand, waiting to pounce upon her. A hatch popped open. Sheeana threw back her shoulders and stood her ground. Very well; they had caught her. She knew what to expect now. Nothing could be gained by flight. Only the priests used \u0027thopters. They could go anywhere and see anything. Two richly robed priests, their garments all gold and white with purple trim, emerged and ran toward her across the sand. They knelt in front of Sheeana so close she could smell their perspiration and the musky melange incense which permeated their clothing. They were young but much like all the priests she could remember: soft of features, uncalloused hands, careless of their moisture losses. Neither of them wore a stillsuit under those robes. The one on her left, his eyes on a level with Sheeana\u0027s, spoke. \"Child of Shai-hulud, we saw your Father bring you from His lands.\" The words made no sense to Sheeana. Priests were men to be feared. Her parents and all the adults she had ever known had impressed this upon her by words and actions. Priests possessed ornithopters. Priests fed you to Shaitan for the slightest infraction or for no infraction at all, for only priestly whims. Her people knew many instances. Sheeana backed away from the kneeling men and cast her glance around. Where could she run? The one who had spoken raised an imploring hand. \"Stay with us.\" \"You\u0027re bad!\" Sheeana\u0027s voice cracked with emotion. Both priests fell prostrate on the sand. Far away on the city\u0027s towers, sunlight flashed off lenses. Sheeana saw them. She knew about such flashings. Priests were always watching you in the cities. When you saw the lenses flash that was the signal to be inconspicuous, to \"be good.\" Sheeana clasped her hands in front of her to still their trembling. She glanced left and right and then at the prostrate priests. Something was wrong here. Heads on the sand, the two priests shuddered with fear and waited. Neither spoke. Sheeana did not know how to respond. The crush of her immediate experiences could not be absorbed by an eight-year-old mind. She knew that her parents and all of her neighbors had been taken by Shaitan. Her own eyes had witnessed this. And Shaitan had brought her here, refusing to take her into his awful fires. She had been spared. This was a word she understood. Spared. It had been explained to her when she learned the dancing song. \"Shai-hulud spare us! \"Take Shaitan away...\" Slowly, not wanting to arouse the prostrate priests, Sheeana began the shuffling, unrhythmic movements of the dance. As the remembered music grew within her, she unclasped her hands and swung her arms wide. Her feet lifted high in the stately movements. Her body turned, slowly at first and then more swiftly as the dance ecstasy increased. Her long brown hair whipped around her face. The two priests dared to lift their heads. The strange child was performing The Dance! They recognized the movements: The Dance of Propitiation. She asked Shai-hulud to forgive his people. She asked God to forgive them! They turned their heads to look at each other and, together, rocked back onto their knees. There, they began clapping in the time-honored effort to distract the dancer. Their hands clapped rhythmically as they chanted the ancient words: \"Our fathers ate manna in the desert, \"In the burning places where whirlwinds came!\" The priests excluded from their attention all except the child. She was a slender thing, they saw, with stringy muscles, thin arms and legs. Her robe and stillsuit were worn and patched like those of the poorest. Her cheekbones had high planes that drew shadows across her olive skin. Brown eyes, they noted. Reddish sun streaks drew their lines in her hair. There was a water-spare sharpness about her features - the narrow nose and chin, the wide forehead, the wide thin mouth, the long neck. She looked like the Fremen portraits in the holy of holies at Dar-es-Balat. Of course! The child of Shai-hulud would look thus. She danced well, too. Not the slightest quickly repeatable rhythm entered her movements. There was rhythm but it was an admirably long beat, at least a hundred steps apart. She kept it up while the sun lifted higher and higher. It was almost noon before she fell exhausted to the sand. The priests stood and looked out into the desert where Shai-hulud had gone. The stampings of the dance had not summoned Him back. They were forgiven. That was how Sheeana\u0027s new life began. Loudly in their own quarters and for many days, the senior priests engaged in arguments about her. At last, they brought their disputations and reports to the High Priest, Hedley Tuek. They met in the afternoon within the Hall of Small Convocations, Tuek and six priestly councillors. Murals of Leto II, a human face on the great wormshape, looked down upon them with benevolence. Tuek seated himself on a stone bench that had been recovered from Windgap Sietch. Muad\u0027dib himself was reputed to have sat on this bench. One of the legs still bore the carvings of an Atreides hawk. His councillors took lesser modern benches facing him. The High Priest was an imposing figure; silky gray hair combed smoothly to his shoulders. It was a suitable frame for the square face with its wide, thick mouth and heavy chin. Tuek\u0027s eyes retained their original clear whites surrounding dark blue pupils. Bushy, untrimmed gray eyebrows shaded his eyes. The councillors were a motley lot. Scions of old priestly families each carried in his heart the belief that matters would move better if he were sitting on Tuek\u0027s bench. The scrawny, pinch-faced Stiros put himself forward as opposition spokesman: \"She is nothing but a poor desert waif and she rode Shai-hulud. That is forbidden and the punishment is mandatory.\" Others spoke up immediately. \"No! No Stiros. You have it wrong! She did not stand on Shai-hulud\u0027s back as the Fremen did. She had no maker hooks or...\" Stiros tried to shout them down. It was deadlocked, Tuek saw: three and three with Umphrud, a fat hedonist, as advocate for \"cautious acceptance.\" \"She had no way to guide Shai-hulud\u0027s course,\" Umphrud argued. \"We all saw how she came down to the sand unafraid and talked to Him.\" Yes, they all had seen that, either at the moment or in the holophoto that a thoughtful observer had recorded. Desert waif or not, she had confronted Shai-hulud and conversed with Him. And Shai-hulud had not engulfed her. No, indeed. The Worm-of-God had drawn back at the child\u0027s command and had returned to the desert. \"We will test her,\" Tuek said. Early the following morning, an ornithopter flown by the two priests who had brought her from the desert conveyed Sheeana far out away from the sight of Keen\u0027s populace. The priests took her down to a dune top and planted a meticulous copy of a Fremen thumper in the sand. When the thumper\u0027s catch was released, a heavy beating trembled through the desert - the ancient summons to Shai-hulud. The priests fled to their \u0027thopter and waited high overhead while a terrified Sheeana, her worst fears realized, stood alone some twenty meters from the thumper. Two worms came. They were not the largest the priests had ever seen, no more than thirty meters long. One of them scooped up the thumper and silenced it. Together, they rounded in parallel tracks and stopped side by side not six meters from Sheeana. She stood submissive, fists clenched at her sides. This was what priests did. They fed you to Shaitan. In their hovering \u0027thopter, the two priests watched with fascination. Their lenses transmitted the scene to equally fascinated observers in the High Priest\u0027s quarters at Keen. All of them had seen similar events before. It was a standard punishment, a handy way to remove obstructionists from the populace or priesthood, or to pave the way for acquisition of a new concubine. Never before, though, had they seen a lone child as victim. And such a child! The Worms-of-God crept forward slowly after their first stop. They became motionless once more when only about three meters from Sheeana. Resigned to her fate, Sheeana did not run. Soon, she thought, she would be with her parents and friends. As the worms remained motionless, anger replaced her terror. The bad priests had left her here! She could hear their \u0027thopter overhead. The hot spice smell from the worms filled the air around her. Abruptly, she raised her right hand and pointed up at the \u0027thopter. \"Go ahead and eat me! That\u0027s what they want!\" The priests overhead could not hear her words but the gesture was visible and they could see that she was talking to the two Worms-of-God. The finger pointing up at them did not bode well. The worms did not move. Sheeana lowered her hand. \"You killed my mother and father and all my friends!\" she accused. She took a step forward and shook a fist at them. The worms retreated, keeping their distance. \"If you don\u0027t want me, go back where you came from!\" She waved them away toward the desert. Obediently, they backed farther and turned in unison. The priests in the \u0027thopter tracked them until they slipped beneath the sand more than a kilometer away. Only then did the priests return, fear and trepidation in them. They plucked the child of Shai-hulud from the sand and returned her to Keen. The Bene Gesserit embassy at Keen had a full report by nightfall. Word was on its way to the Chapter House by the following morning. It had happened at last! The trouble with some kinds of warfare (and be certain the Tyrant knew this, because it is implicit in his lesson) is that they destroy all moral decency in susceptible types. Warfare of these kinds will dump the destroyed survivors back into an innocent population that is incapable of even imagining what such returned soldiers might do. - Teachings of the Golden Path, Bene Gesserit Archives One of Miles Teg\u0027s early memories was of sitting at dinner with his parents and his younger brother, Sabine. Teg had been only seven at the time, but the events lay indelibly in his memory: the dining room on Lernaeus colorful with freshly cut flowers, the low light of the yellow sun diffused by antique shades. Bright blue dinnerware and glistening silver graced the table. Acolyte servants stood ready at hand, because his mother might be permanently detached on special duty but her function as a Bene Gesserit teacher was not to be wasted. Janet Roxbrough-Teg, a large-boned woman who appeared cast for the part of grande dame, looked down her nose from one end of the table, watching that the dinner service not be impaired by the slightest misplacement. Loschy Teg, Miles\u0027 father, always observed this with a faint air of amusement. He was a thin man with high forehead, a face so narrow his dark eyes appeared to bulge at the sides. His black hair was a perfect counterpoint for his wife\u0027s fairness. Above the subdued sounds at the table and the rich smell of spiced edu soup, his mother instructed his father on how to deal with an importunate Free Trader. When she said \"Tleilaxu,\" she had Miles\u0027 entire attention. His education had just recently touched on the Bene Tleilax. Even Sabine, who succumbed many years later to a poisoner on Romo, listened with as much of his four-year-old awareness as he could muster. Sabine hero-worshiped his brother. Anything that caught the attention of Miles was of interest to Sabine. Both boys listened silently. \"The man is fronting for the Tleilaxu,\" Lady Janet said. \"I can hear it in his voice.\" \"I do not doubt your ability to detect such things, my dear,\" Loschy Teg said. \"But what am I to do? He has the proper tokens of credit and he wishes to buy the -\" \"The order for the rice is unimportant at the moment. Never assume that what a Face Dancer appears to seek is actually what it seeks.\" \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s not a Face Dancer. He -\" \"Loschy! I know you have learned this well at my instruction and can detect a Face Dancer. I agree that the Free Trader is not one of them. The Face Dancers remain on his ship. They know I am here.\" \"They know they could not fool you. Yes, but -\" \"Tleilaxu strategy is always woven within a web of strategies, any one of which may be the real strategy. They learned that from us.\" \"My dear, if we are dealing with Tleilaxu, and I do not question your judgment, then it immediately becomes a question of melange.\" Lady Janet nodded her head gently. Indeed, even Miles knew about the Tleilaxu connection with the spice. It was one of the things that fascinated him about the Tleilaxu. For every milligram of melange produced on Rakis, the Bene Tleilax tanks produced long tons. Use of melange had grown to fit the new supply and even the Spacing Guild bent its knee before this power. \"But the rice...\" Loschy Teg ventured. \"My dear husband, the Bene Tleilax have no need of that much pongi rice in our sector. They require it for trade. We must find out who really needs the rice.\" \"You want me to delay,\" he said. \"Precisely. You are superb at what we now require. Don\u0027t give that Free Trader the chance to say yes or no. Someone trained by the Face Dancers will appreciate such subtlety.\" \"We lure the Face Dancers out of the ship while you initiate inquiries elsewhere.\" Lady Janet smiled. \"You are lovely when you leap ahead of me that way.\" A look of understanding passed between them. \"He cannot go to another supplier in this sector,\" Loschy Teg said. \"He will wish to avoid a go, no-go confrontation,\" Lady Janet said, patting the table. \"Delay, delay, and more delay. You must draw the Face Dancers out of the ship.\" \"They will realize, of course.\" \"Yes, my dear, and it is dangerous. You must always meet on your own ground and with our own guards nearby.\" Miles Teg recalled that his father had, indeed, drawn the Face Dancers out of their ship. His mother had taken Miles to the viewer where he watched the copper-walled room in which his father drove the bargain that won CHOAM\u0027s highest commendation and a rich bonus. The first Face Dancers Miles Teg ever saw: Two small men as alike as twins. Almost chinless round faces, pug noses, tiny mouths, black button eyes, and short-cropped white hair that stood up from their heads like the bristles on a brush. The two were dressed as the Free Trader had been - black tunics and trousers. \"Illusion, Miles,\" his mother said. \"Illusion is their way. The fashioning of illusion to achieve real goals, that is how the Tleilaxu work.\" \"Like the magician at the Winter Show?\" Miles asked, his gaze intent on the viewer and its toy-figure scene. \"Quite similar,\" his mother agreed. She too watched the viewer as she spoke but one arm went protectively around her son\u0027s shoulders. \"You are looking at evil, Miles. Study it carefully. The faces you see can be changed in an instant. They can grow taller, appear heavier. They could mimic your father so that only I would recognize the substitution.\" Miles Teg\u0027s mouth formed a soundless \"O.\" He stared at the viewer, listening to his father explain that the price of CHOAM\u0027s pongi rice once more had gone up alarmingly. \"And the most terrible thing of all,\" his mother said. \"Some of the newer Face Dancers can, by touching the flesh of a victim, absorb some of the victim\u0027s memories.\" \"They read minds?\" Miles looked up at his mother. \"Not exactly. We think they take a print of the memories, almost a holophoto process. They do not yet know that we are aware of this.\" Miles understood. He was not to speak of this to anyone, not even to his father or his mother. She had taught him the Bene Gesserit way of secrecy. He watched the figures in the screen with care. At his father\u0027s words, the Face Dancers betrayed no emotion, but their eyes appeared to glitter more brightly. \"How did they get so evil?\" Miles asked. \"They are communal beings, bred not to identify with any shape or face. The appearance they present now is for my benefit. They know I am watching. They have relaxed into their natural communal shape. Mark it closely.\" Miles tipped his head to one side and studied the Face Dancers. They looked so bland and ineffectual. \"They have no sense of self,\" his mother said. \"They have only the instinct to preserve their own lives unless ordered to die for their masters.\" \"Would they do that?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-4.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
