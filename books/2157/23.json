{"id":97411,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"Odrade has it all right in her hands, Taraza thought. She had Sheeana. Soon, if Burzmali succeeded, she would have the ghola. She had the Tleilaxu Master of Masters. She could have Rakis itself!\\n\\n If only she were not an Atreides.\\n\\n Taraza glanced at the projected words still dancing above her tabletop: a comparison of this newest Duncan Idaho with all of the slain ones. Each new ghola had been slightly different from its predecessors. That was clear enough. The Tleilaxu were perfecting something. But what? Was the clue hidden in these new Face Dancers? The Tleilaxu obviously sought an undetectable Face Dancer, mimics whose mimicry reached perfection, shape-copiers who copied not only the surface memories of their victims but the deepest thoughts and identity as well. It was a form of immortality even more enticing than the one the Tleilaxu Masters used at present. That obviously was why they followed this course.\\n\\n Her own analysis agreed with the majority of her advisors: Such a mimic would become the copied person. Odrade\u0027s reports on the Face Dancer Tuek were highly suggestive. Even the Tleilaxu Masters might not be able to shake such a Face Dancer out of its mimic shape and behavior.\\n\\n And its beliefs.\\n\\n Damn Odrade! She had painted her Sisters into a corner. They had no choice except to follow Odrade\u0027s lead and Odrade knew it!\\n\\n How did she know it? Was it that wild talent again?\\n\\n I cannot act blindly. I must know.\\n\\n Taraza went through the well-remembered regimen to restore a sense of calm. She dared not make momentous decisions in a frustrated mood. A long look at the statuette of Chenoeh helped. Lifting herself from the chairdog, Taraza returned to her favorite window.\\n\\n It often soothed her to stare out at this landscape, observing how the distances changed with the daily movement of sunlight and shifts in the planet\u0027s well-managed weather.\\n\\n Hunger prodded her.\\n\\n I will eat with the acolytes and lay Sisters today.\\n\\n It helped at times to gather the young around her and remember the persistence of the eating rituals, the daily timing - morning, noon, and evening. That formed a reliable cement. She enjoyed watching her people. They were like a tide speaking of deeper things, of unseen forces and greater powers that persisted because the Bene Gesserit had found the ways of flowing with that persistence.\\n\\n These thoughts renewed Taraza\u0027s balance. Nagging questions could be placed temporarily at a distance. She could look at them without passion.\\n\\n Odrade and the Tyrant were right: Without noble purpose we are nothing.\\n\\n One could not escape, though, the fact that critical decisions were being made on Rakis by a person who suffered from those recurring Atreides flaws. Odrade had always displayed typical Atreides weakness. She had been positively benevolent to erring acolytes. Affections developed out of such behavior!\\n\\n Dangerous and mind-clouding affections.\\n\\n This weakened others, who then were required to compensate for such laxity. More competent Sisters were called upon to take erring acolytes in hand and correct the weaknesses. Of course, Odrade\u0027s behavior had exposed these flaws in acolytes. One must admit this. Perhaps Odrade reasoned thus.\\n\\n When she thought this way, something subtle and powerful shifted in Taraza\u0027s perceptions. She was forced to put down a deep sense of loneliness. It rankled. Melancholy could be quite as mind-clouding as affection... or even love. Taraza and her watchful Memory Sisters ascribed such emotional responses to awareness of mortality. She was forced to confront the fact that one day she would be no more than a set of memories in someone else\u0027s living flesh.\\n\\n Memories and accidental discoveries, she saw, had made her vulnerable. And just when she needed every available faculty!\\n\\n But I am not yet dead.\\n\\n Taraza knew how to restore herself. And she knew the consequences. Always after these bouts of melancholy she regained an even firmer grip on her life and its purposes. Odrade\u0027s flawed behavior was a source of her Mother Superior\u0027s strength.\\n\\n Odrade knew it. Taraza smiled grimly at this awareness. The Mother Superior\u0027s authority over her Sisters always became stronger when she returned from melancholy. Others had observed this but only Odrade knew about the rage.\\n\\n There!\\n\\n Taraza realized that she had confronted the distressful seeds of her frustration.\\n\\n Odrade had clearly recognized on several occasions what sat at the core of the Mother Superior\u0027s behavior. A giant howl of rage against the uses others had made of her life. The power of that suppressed rage was daunting even though it could never be expressed in a way that vented it. That rage must never be allowed to heal. How it hurt! Odrade\u0027s awareness made the pain even more intense.\\n\\n Such things did what they were supposed to do, of course. Bene Gesserit impositions developed certain mental muscles. They built up layers of callousness that could never be revealed to outsiders. Love was one of the most dangerous forces in the universe. They had to protect themselves against it. A Reverend Mother could never become intimately personal, not even in the services of the Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n Simulation: We play the necessary role that saves us. The Bene Gesserit will persist!\\n\\n How long would they be subservient this time? Another thirty-five hundred years? Well, damn them all! It would still be only a temporary thing.\\n\\n Taraza turned her back on the window and its restorative view. She did feel restored. New strength flowed into her. There was strength enough to overcome that gnawing reluctance which had kept her from making the essential decision.\\n\\n I will go to Rakis.\\n\\n She no longer could evade the source of her own reluctance.\\n\\n I may have to do what Bellonda wants.\\n\\n Survival of self, of species, and of environment, these are what drive humans. You can observe how the order of importance changes in a lifetime. What are the things of immediate concern at a given age? Weather? The state of the digestion? Does she (or he) really care? All of those various hungers that flesh can sense and hope to satisfy. What else could possibly matter?\\n\\n - Leto II to Hwi Noree, His Voice: Dar-es-Balat\\n\\n Miles Teg awoke in darkness to find himself being carried on a litter sling supported by suspensors. By their faint energy glow, he could see the tiny suspensor bulbs in an updangling row around him.\\n\\n There was a gag in his mouth. His hands were securely tied behind his back. His eyes remained uncovered.\\n\\n So they don\u0027t care what I see.\\n\\n Who they were he could not tell. The bobbing motions of the dark shapes around him suggested they were descending uneven terrain. A trail? The litter sling rode smoothly on its suspensors. He could sense the faint humming from the suspensors when his party stopped to negotiate the turn of a difficult passage.\\n\\n Now and then through some intervening obstruction, he saw the flickering of a light ahead. They entered the lighted area presently and stopped. He saw a single glowglobe about three meters off the ground, tethered on a pole and moving gently in a cold breeze. By its yellow glow he discerned a shack in the center of a muddy clearing, many tracks in trampled snow. He saw bushes and a few sparse trees around the clearing. Someone passed a brighter handlight across his face. Nothing was said but Teg saw a hand gesture toward the shack. He had seldom seen such a dilapidated structure. It looked ready to collapse at the slightest touch. He bet himself that the roof leaked.\\n\\n Once more, his party lurched into motion, swinging him toward the shack. He studied his escort in the dim light - faces muffled to the eyes in a cover that obscured mouths and chins. Hoods hid their hair. The clothing was bulky and concealed body details except for the general articulation of arms and legs.\\n\\n The pole-tethered glowglobe went dark.\\n\\n A door opened in the shack, sending a brilliant glare across the clearing. His escort hustled him inside and left him there. He heard the door close behind them.\\n\\n It was almost blindingly bright inside after the darkness. Teg blinked until his eyes adapted to the change. With an odd sense of displacement, he looked around him. He had expected the shack\u0027s interior to match its exterior but here was a neat room almost bare of furnishings - only three chairs, a small table and... he drew in a sharp breath: an Ixian Probe! Couldn\u0027t they smell the shere on his breath?\\n\\n If they were that unaware, let them use the probe. It would be agony for him but they would get nothing from his mind.\\n\\n Something clicked behind him and he heard motion. Three people came into his field of vision and ranged themselves around the foot of the litter. They stared at him silently. Teg moved his attention across the three. The one on his left wore a dark singlesuit with open lapels. Male. He had the squarish face Teg had seen on some Gammu natives - small, beady eyes that stared straight through Teg. It was the face of an inquisitor, one who would not be moved by your agony. The Harkonnens had imported a lot of those in their day. Single-purpose types who could create pain without the slightest change of expression.\\n\\n The one directly at Teg\u0027s feet wore bulky clothing of black and gray similar to that of the escort but the hood was thrown back to reveal a bland face under closely cropped gray hair. The face gave nothing away and the clothing revealed little. No telling if this one was male or female. Teg recorded the face: wide forehead, square chin, large green eyes above a knife-ridged nose; a tiny mouth pursed around a moue of distaste.\\n\\n The third member of this group held Teg\u0027s attention longest: tall, a tailored black singlesuit with a severe black jacket over it. Perfectly fitted. Expensive. No decorations or insignia. Male definitely. The man affected boredom and this gave Teg a tag for him. Narrow, supercilious face, brown eyes, thin-lipped mouth. Bored, bored, bored! All of this in here was an unwarranted demand on his very important time. He had vital business elsewhere and these other two, these underlings, must be made to realize that.\\n\\n That one, Teg thought, is the official observer.\\n\\n The bored one had been sent by the masters of this place to watch and report what he saw. Where was his datacase? Ahhhh, yes: There it was, propped against a wall behind him. Those cases were like a badge for such functionaries. On his inspection tour, Teg had seen these people walking the streets of Ysai and other Gammu cities. Small, thin cases. The more important the functionary, the smaller the case. This one\u0027s case would barely contain a few dataspools and a tiny comeye. He would never be without an \u0027eye to link him with his superiors. Thin case: This was an important functionary.\\n\\n Teg found himself wondering what the observer would say if Teg asked: \"What will you tell them about my composure?\"\\n\\n The answer was already there on that bored face. He would not even answer. He was not here to answer. When this one leaves, Teg thought, he will walk with long strides. His attention will be on distances where only he knows what powers await him. He will slap that case against his leg to remind himself of his importance and to call the attention of these others to his badge of authority.\\n\\n The bulky figure at Teg\u0027s feet spoke, a compelling voice and definitely female in those vibrant tones.\\n\\n \"See how he holds himself and watches us? Silence will not break him. I told you that before we entered. You are wasting our time and we do not have all that much time for such nonsense.\"\\n\\n Teg stared at her. Something vaguely familiar in the voice. It had some of that compelling quality found in a Reverend Mother. Was that possible?\\n\\n The heavy-faced Gammu type nodded. \"You are right, Materly. But I do not give the orders here.\"\\n\\n Materly? Teg wondered. Name or title?\\n\\n Both of them looked at the functionary. That one turned and bent to his datacase. He removed a small comeye from it and stood with the screen concealed from his companions and Teg. The \u0027eye came alight with a green glow, which cast a sickly illumination over the observer\u0027s features. His self-important smile vanished. He moved his lips silently, words formed only for someone on that \u0027eye to see.\\n\\n Teg hid his ability to read lips. Anyone trained by the Bene Gesserit could read lips from almost any angle where they were visible. This man spoke a version of Old Galach.\\n\\n \"It is the Bashar Teg for sure,\" he said. \"I have made identification.\"\\n\\n The green light danced on the functionary\u0027s face while he stared into the \u0027eye. Whoever communicated with him was in agitated movement if that light meant anything.\\n\\n Again, the functionary\u0027s lips moved soundlessly: \"None of us doubts that he has been conditioned against pain and I can smell shere on him. He will...\"\\n\\n He fell silent as the green light once more danced on his face.\\n\\n \"I do not make excuses.\" His lips shaped the Old Galach words with care. \"You know we will do our best but I recommend that we pursue with vigor all other means of intercepting the ghola.\"\\n\\n The green light winked off.\\n\\n The functionary clipped the \u0027eye to his waist, turned toward his companions and nodded once.\\n\\n \"The T-probe,\" the woman said.\\n\\n They swung the probe over Teg\u0027s head.\\n\\n She called it a T-probe, Teg thought. He looked up at the hood as they brought it over him. There was no Ixian stamp on the thing.\\n\\n Teg experienced an odd sense of deja vu. He had the feeling that his own captivity here had occurred many times before. No single-incident deja vu, it was a deeply familiar recognition: the captive and the interrogators - these three... the probe. He felt emptied. How could he know this moment? He had never personally employed a probe but he had studied their use thoroughly. The Bene Gesserit often used pain but relied mostly on Truthsayers. Even more than that, the Sisterhood believed that some equipment could put them too much under Ixian influence. It was an admission of weakness, a sign that they could not do without such despicable devices. Teg had even suspected there was something in this attitude of a hangover from the Butlerian Jihad, rebellion against machines that could copy out the essence of a human\u0027s thoughts and memories.\\n\\n Deja vu!\\n\\n Mentat logic demanded of him: How do I know this moment? He knew that he had never before been a captive. It was such a ridiculous switch of roles. The great Bashar Teg a captive? He could almost smile. But that deep sense of familiarity persisted.\\n\\n His captors positioned the hood directly over his head and began releasing the medusa contacts one at a time, fixing them to his scalp. The functionary watched his companions work, producing small signs of impatience on an otherwise emotionless face.\\n\\n Teg moved his attention across the three faces. Which one of these would act the part of \"friend\"? Ahhhh, yes: the one called Materly. Fascinating. Was it a form of Honored Matre? But neither of the others deferred to her as one would expect from what Teg had heard of those returning Lost Ones.\\n\\n These were people from the Scattering, though - except possibly for the square-faced male in the brown singlesuit. Teg studied the woman with care: the matt of gray hair, the quiet composure in those widely spaced green eyes, the slightly protruding chin with its sense of solidity and reliability. She had been chosen well for \"friend.\" Materly\u0027s face was a map of respectability, someone you could trust. Teg saw a withdrawn quality in her, though. She was one who would also observe carefully to catch the moment when she must become involved. Surely, she was Bene Gesserit-trained at the very least.\\n\\n Or trained by the Honored Matres.\\n\\n They finished attaching the contacts to his head. The Gammu type swung the probe\u0027s console into position where all three could watch the display. The probe\u0027s screen was concealed from Teg.\\n\\n The woman removed Teg\u0027s gag, confirming his judgment. She would be the source of comfort. He moved his tongue around in his mouth, restoring sensation. His face and chest still felt a bit numb from the stunner that had brought him down. How long ago had that been? But if he was to believe the silent words of the functionary, Duncan had escaped.\\n\\n The Gammu type looked to the observer.\\n\\n \"You may begin, Yar,\" the functionary said.\\n\\n Yar? Teg wondered. Curious name. Almost had a Tleilaxu sound. But Yar was not a Face Dancer... or a Tleilaxu Master. Too big for one and no stigmata of the other. As one trained by the Sisterhood, Teg felt confident of this.\\n\\n Yar touched a control on the probe\u0027s console.\\n\\n Teg heard himself grunt with pain. Nothing had prepared him for that much pain. They must have turned their devil\u0027s machine to maximum for the first thrust. No question about it! They knew he was a Mentat. A Mentat could remove himself from some demands of flesh. But this was excruciating! He could not escape it. Agony shivered through his entire body, threatening to blank out his consciousness. Could shere shield him from this?\\n\\n The pain diminished gradually and went away, leaving only quivering memories.\\n\\n Again!\\n\\n He thought suddenly that the spice agony must be like this for a Reverend Mother. Surely, there could be no greater pain. He fought to remain silent but heard himself grunting, moaning. Every ability he had ever learned, Mentat and Bene Gesserit, was called into play, keeping him from forming words, from begging for surcease, from promising to tell them anything if they would only stop.\\n\\n Once more the agony receded and then surged back.\\n\\n \"Enough!\" That was the woman. Teg groped for her name.\\n\\n Materly?\\n\\n Yar spoke in a sullen voice: \"He\u0027s loaded with shere, enough to last him a year at least.\" He gestured at his console. \"Blank.\"\\n\\n Teg breathed in shallow gasps. The agony! It continued to increase despite Materly\u0027s demand.\\n\\n \"I said enough!\" Materly snapped.\\n\\n Such sincerity, Teg thought. He felt the pain recede, withdrawing as though every nerve were being removed from his body, pulled out like threads of the remembered agony.\\n\\n \"It is wrong what we\u0027re doing,\" Materly said. \"This man is -\"\\n\\n \"He is like any other man,\" Yar said. \"Shall I attach the special contact to his penis?\"\\n\\n \"Not while I\u0027m here!\" Materly said.\\n\\n Teg felt himself almost taken in by her sincerity. The last of the agony threads left his flesh and he lay there with a feeling that he had been suspended off the surface that supported him. The sense of deja vu remained. He was here and not here. He had been here and he had not.\\n\\n \"They will not like it if we fail,\" Yar said. \"Are you prepared to face them with another failure?\"\\n\\n Materly shook her head sharply. She bent over to bring her face into Teg\u0027s line of vision through the medusa tangle of probe contacts. \"Bashar, I am sorry for what we do. Believe me. This is not of my making. Please, I find all of this disgusting. Tell us what we need to know and let me make you comfortable.\"\\n\\n Teg formed a smile for her. She was good! He shifted his gaze to the watchful functionary. \"Tell your masters for me. She is very good at this.\"\\n\\n Blood darkened the functionary\u0027s face. He scowled. \"Give him the maximum, Yar.\" His voice was a clipped tenor without any of the deep training apparent in Materly\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Please!\" Materly said. She straightened but kept her attention on Teg\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n Teg\u0027s Bene Gesserit teachers had taught him that: \"Watch the eyes! Observe how they change focus. As the focus moves outward, the awareness moves inward.\"\\n\\n He focused deliberately on her nose. It was not an ugly face. Rather distinctive. He wondered what the figure might be under those bulky clothes.\\n\\n \"Yar!\" That was the functionary.\\n\\n Yar adjusted something on his console and pressed a switch.\\n\\n The agony that surged through Teg now told him the previous level had, indeed, been lower. With the new pain came an odd clarity. Teg found himself almost capable of removing his awareness from this intrusion. All of that pain was happening to someone else. He had found a haven where little touched him. There was pain. Agony even. He accepted reports about these sensations. That was partly the shere\u0027s doing, of course. He knew that and was thankful.\\n\\n Materly\u0027s voice intruded: \"I think we\u0027re losing him. Better ease off.\"\\n\\n Another voice responded but the sound faded into stillness before Teg could identify the words. He realized abruptly that he had no anchor point for his awareness. Stillness! He thought he heard his heart beating rapidly in fear but he was not sure. All was stillness, profound quiet with nothing behind it.\\n\\n Am I still alive?\\n\\n He found a heartbeat then, but no certainty that it was his own. Thump-thump! Thump-thump! It was a sensation of movement and no sound. He could not fix the source.\\n\\n What is happening to me?\\n\\n Words blazoned in brilliant white against a black background played across his visual centers:\\n\\n \"I\u0027m back to one-third.\"\\n\\n \"Leave it at that. See if we can read him through his physical reactions.\"\\n\\n \"Can he still hear us?\"\\n\\n \"Not consciously.\"\\n\\n None of Teg\u0027s instructions had told him a probe could do its evil work in the presence of shere. But they called this a T-probe. Could bodily reactions provide a clue to suppressed thoughts? Were there revelations to be explored by physical means?\\n\\n Again, words played against Teg\u0027s visual centers: \"Is he still isolated?\"\\n\\n \"Completely.\"\\n\\n \"Make sure. Take him a little deeper.\"\\n\\n Teg tried to lift his awareness above his fears.\\n\\n I must remain in control!\\n\\n What might his body reveal if he had no contact with it? He could imagine what they were doing and his mind registered panic but his flesh could not feel it.\\n\\n Isolate the subject. Give him nowhere to seat his identity.\\n\\n Who had said that? Someone. The sense of deja vu returned in full force.\\n\\n I am a Mentat, he reminded himself. My mind and its workings are my center. He possessed experiences and memories upon which a center could rely.\\n\\n Pain returned. Sounds. Loud! Much too loud!\\n\\n \"He\u0027s hearing again.\" That was Yar.\\n\\n \"How can that be?\" The functionary\u0027s tenor.\\n\\n \"Perhaps you\u0027ve set it too low.\" Materly.\\n\\n Teg tried to open his eyes. The lids would not obey. He remembered then. They had called it a T-probe. This was no Ixian device. This was something from the Scattering. He could identify where it took over his muscles and senses. It was like another person sharing his flesh, preempting his own reactive patterns. He allowed himself to follow the workings of this machine\u0027s intrusions. It was a hellish device! It could order him to blink, fart, gasp, shit, piss - anything. It could command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior. He was relegated to the role of observer.\\n\\n Odors assailed him - disgusting odors. He would not command himself to frown but he thought of frowning. That was sufficient. These odors had been elicited by the probe. It was playing his senses, learning them.\\n\\n \"Do you have enough to read him?\" The functionary\u0027s tenor.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s still hearing us!\" Yar.\\n\\n \"Damn all Mentats!\" Materly.\\n\\n \"Dit, Dat, and Dot,\" Teg said, naming the puppets of the Winter Show from his childhood on long-ago Lernaeus.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s talking!\" The functionary.\\n\\n Teg felt his awareness being blocked off by the machine. Yar was doing something at the console. Still, Teg knew his own Mentat logic had told him something vital: These three were puppets. Only the puppet masters were important. How the puppets moved - that told you what the puppet masters were doing.\\n\\n The probe continued to intrude. Despite the force being applied, Teg felt his awareness matching the thing. It was learning him but he was also learning it.\\n\\n He understood now. The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified, tagged for Yar to call up when needed. An organic chain of responses existed within Teg. The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him. The shere and his Mentat resistance shunted the searchers away from his memories but everything else could be copied.\\n\\n It will not think like me, he reassured himself.\\n\\n The machine would not be the same as his nerves and flesh. It would not have Teg-memories or Teg-experiences. It had not been born of woman. It had never traveled down a birth canal and emerged into this astonishing universe.\\n\\n Part of Teg\u0027s awareness applied a memory marker, telling him that this observation revealed something about the ghola.\\n\\n Duncan was decanted from an axlotl tank.\\n\\n The observation came to Teg with a sudden sharp biting of acid on his tongue.\\n\\n The T-probe again!\\n\\n Teg allowed himself to flow through a multiple simultaneous awareness. He followed the T-probe\u0027s workings and continued to explore this observation about the ghola, all the while listening for Dit, Dat, and Dot. The three puppets were oddly silent. Yes, waiting for their T-probe to complete its task.\\n\\n The ghola: Duncan was an extension of cells that had been born of a woman impregnated by a man.\\n\\n Machine and ghola!\\n\\n Observation: The machine cannot share that birth experience except in a remotely vicarious way sure to miss important personal nuances.\\n\\n Just as it was missing other things in him right now.\\n\\n The T-probe was replaying smells. With each induced odor, memories revealed their presence in Teg\u0027s mind. He felt the great speed of the T-probe but his own awareness lived outside of that headlong rushing search, able to entangle him for as long as he desired in the memories being called up here.\\n\\n There!\\n\\n That was the hot wax he had spilled on his left hand when only fourteen and a student in the Bene Gesserit school. He recalled school and laboratory as though his only existence were there at this moment. The school is attached to Chapter House. By being admitted here, Teg knew he had the blood of Siona in his veins. No prescient could track him here.\\n\\n He saw the lab and smelled the wax - a compound of artificial esters and the natural product of bees kept by failed Sisters and their helpers. He turned his memory to a moment when he watched bees and people at their labors in the apple orchards.\\n\\n The workings of the Bene Gesserit social structure appeared so complicated until you saw through to the necessities: food, clothing, warmth, communication, learning, protection from enemies (a subset of the survival drive). Bene Gesserit survival took some adjustments before it could be understood. They did not procreate for the sake of humankind in general. No unmonitored racial involvement! They procreated to extend their own powers, to continue the Bene Gesserit, deeming that a sufficient service to humankind. Perhaps it was. Procreative motivation went deep and the Sisterhood was so thorough.\\n\\n A new smell assailed him.\\n\\n He recognized the wet wool of his clothing as he came into the command pod after the Battle of Ponciard. The smell filled his nostrils and elicited the ozone of the pod\u0027s instruments, the sweat of the other occupants. Wool! The Sisterhood had always thought it a bit odd of him, the way he preferred natural fabrics and shunned the synthetics turned out in captive factories.\\n\\n No more did he care for chairdogs.\\n\\n I don\u0027t like the smells of oppression in any form.\\n\\n Did these puppets - Dit, Dat, and Dot - know how oppressed they were?\\n\\n Mentat logic sneered at him. Were not wool fabrics also a product of captive factories?\\n\\n It was different.\\n\\n Part of him argued otherwise. Synthetics could be stored almost indefinitely. Look how long they had endured in the nullentropy bins of the Harkonnen no-globe.\\n\\n \"I still prefer woolens and cottons!\"\\n\\n So be it!\\n\\n \"But how did I come by such a preference?\"\\n\\n It is an Atreides prejudice. You inherited it.\\n\\n Teg shunted the smells aside and concentrated on the total movement of the intrusive probe. He found presently that he could anticipate the thing. It was a new muscle. He allowed himself to flex it while he continued to examine the induced memories for valuable insights.\\n\\n I sit outside my mother\u0027s door on Lernaeus.\\n\\n Teg removed part of his awareness and watched the scene: age eleven. He is talking to a small Bene Gesserit acolyte who came as part of the escort for Somebody Important. The acolyte is a tiny thing with red-blond hair and a doll\u0027s face. Upturned nose, green-gray eyes. The SI is a black-robed Reverend Mother of truly ancient appearance. She has gone behind that nearby door with Teg\u0027s mother. The acolyte, who is named Carlana, is trying her fledgling skills on the young son of the house.\\n\\n Before Carlana utters twenty words, Miles Teg recognizes the pattern. She is trying to pry information out of him! This was one of the first lessons in delicate dissembling taught by his mother. There were, after all, people who might question a young boy about a Reverend Mother\u0027s household, hoping thereby to gain salable information. There is always a market for data about Reverend Mothers.\\n\\n His mother explained: \"You judge the questioner and fit your responses according to the susceptibilities.\" None of this would have served against a full Reverend Mother, but against an acolyte, especially this one!\\n\\n For Carlana, he produces an appearance of coy reluctance. Carlana has an inflated view of her own attractions. He allows her to overcome his reluctance after a suitable marshaling of her forces. What she gets is a handful of lies, which, if she ever repeats them to the SI behind that closed door, are sure to win Carlana a severe censuring if not something more painful.\\n\\n Words from Dit, Dat, and Dot: \"I think we have him now.\"\\n\\n Teg recognized Yar\u0027s voice yanking him out of old memories. \"Fit your responses according to the susceptibilities.\" Teg heard the words in his mother\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Puppets.\\n\\n Puppet masters.\\n\\n The functionary speaks: \"Ask the simulation where they have taken the ghola.\"\\n\\n Silence and then a faint humming.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not getting anything.\" Yar.\\n\\n Teg hears their voices with painful sensitivity. He forces his eyes to open against the opposing commands of the probe.\\n\\n \"Look!\" Yar says.\\n\\n Three sets of eyes stare back at Teg. How slowly they move. Dit, Dat, and Dot: the eyes go blink... blink... at least a minute between blinks. Yar is reaching for something on his console. His fingers will take a week to reach their destination.\\n\\n Teg explores the bindings on his hands and arms. Ordinary rope! Taking his time, he squirms his fingers into contact with the knots. They loosen, slowly at first, and then flying apart. He moves on to the straps holding him to the sling litter. These are easier: simple slip locks. Yar\u0027s hand is not even a fourth of the way to the console.\\n\\n Blink... blink... blink...\\n\\n The three sets of eyes show faint surprise.\\n\\n Teg releases himself from the medusa tangle of probe contacts. Pop-pop-pop! The grippers fly away from him. He is surprised to notice a slow start of bleeding on the back of his right hand where it has brushed the probe contacts aside.\\n\\n Mentat projection: I am moving with dangerous speed.\\n\\n But now he is off the litter. Functionary is reaching a slow-slow hand toward a bulge in a side pocket. Teg\u0027s hand crushes the functionary\u0027s throat. Functionary will never again touch that little lasgun he always carries. Yar\u0027s outstretched hand is still not a third of the way to the probe console. There is definite surprise in his eyes, though. Teg doubts that the man even sees the hand that breaks his neck. Materly is moving a bit faster. Her left foot is coming toward where Teg had been just the flick of an instant previously. Still too slow! Materly\u0027s head is thrown back, the throat exposed for Teg\u0027s down-chopping hand.\\n\\n How slowly they fall to the floor!\\n\\n Teg became aware of perspiration pouring from him but he could not spare time to worry about this.\\n\\n I knew every move they would make before they made it! What has happened to me?\\n\\n Mentat projection: The probe agony has lifted me to a new level of ability.\\n\\n Intense hunger pangs made him aware of the energy drain. He pushed the sensation aside, feeling himself return to a normal time beat. Three dull sounds: bodies falling to the floor.\\n\\n Teg examined the probe console. Definitely not Ixian. Similar controls, though. He shorted out the data storage system, erasing it.\\n\\n Room lights?\\n\\n Controls beside the door from the outside. He extinguished the lights, took three deep breaths. A whirling blur of motion erupted into the night.\\n\\n The ones who had brought him here, clad in their bulky clothing against the winter chill, barely had time to turn toward the odd sound before the whirling blur struck them down.\\n\\n Teg returned to normal time-beat more quickly. Starlight showed him a trail leading downslope through thick brush. He slipped and slid on the snow-churned mud for a space and then found the way to balance himself, anticipating the terrain. Each step went where he knew it must go. He found himself presently in an open space that looked out across a valley.\\n\\n The lights of a city and a great black rectangle of building near the center. He knew this place: Ysai. The puppet masters were there.\\n\\n I am free!\\n\\n There was a man who sat each day looking out through a narrow vertical opening where a single board had been removed from a tall wooden fence. Each day a wild ass of the desert passed outside the fence and across the narrow opening - first the nose, then the head, the forelegs, the long brown back, the hindlegs, and lastly the tail. One day, the man leaped to his feet with the light of discovery in his eyes and he shouted for all who could hear him: \"It is obvious! The nose causes the tail!\" -Stories of the Hidden Wisdom, from the Oral History of Rakis\\n\\n Several times since coming to Rakis, Odrade had found herself caught in the memory of that ancient painting which occupied such a prominent place on the wall of Taraza\u0027s Chapter House quarters. When the memory came, she felt her hands tingle to the touch of the brush. Her nostrils swelled to the induced smells of oils and pigments. Her emotions assaulted the canvas. Each time, Odrade emerged from the memory with new doubts that Sheeana was her canvas.\\n\\n Which of us paints the other?\\n\\n It had happened again this morning. Still dark outside the Rakian Keep\u0027s penthouse where she quartered with Sheeana: An acolyte entered softly to waken Odrade and tell her that Taraza would arrive shortly. Odrade looked up at the softly illuminated face of the dark-haired acolyte and immediately that memory-painting flashed into her awareness.\\n\\n Which of us truly creates another?\\n\\n \"Let Sheeana sleep a bit longer,\" Odrade said before dismissing the acolyte.\\n\\n \"Will you breakfast before the Mother Superior\u0027s arrival?\" the acolyte asked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-23.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) \\n With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
