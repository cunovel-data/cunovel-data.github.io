{"id":97408,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Bending close with her light held at a sharp angle on one side, she saw that she had glimpsed only the shadow of something etched deeply into the rock. Dust concealed most of it. She knelt and brushed the dust aside. Very thin etching and very deep. Whatever this was, it had been meant to endure. The last message of a lost Reverend Mother? This was a known Bene Gesserit artifice. She pressed sensitive fingertips against the etching and reconstructed its tracery in her mind.\n Recognition leaped into her awareness: one word - inscribed in ancient Chakobsa, \"Here.\"\n This was no ordinary \"here\" to mark an ordinary place but the accented and emphatic \"here\" that said: \"You have found me!\" Her hammering heart emphasized it.\n Odrade rested her handlight on the floor near her right knee and let her fingers explore the threshold beside that ancient summons. The stonework appeared unbroken to the eye but her fingers detected a tiny discontinuity. She pressed the discontinuity, twisted, turned, changed the angle of pressure several times and repeated her effort.\n Nothing.\n Sitting back on her heels, Odrade studied the situation.\n \"Here.\"\n The warning sense had grown even more acute. She could feel it as a pressure on her breathing.\n Withdrawing slightly, she pulled her light back and lay full length on the floor to stare narrowly along the base of the threshold. Here! Could she place a tool there beside that word and lever the threshold? No... a tool was not indicated. This thing had the smell of the Tyrant, not of a Reverend Mother. She tried to push the threshold sideways. Nothing moved.\n Feeling the tensions and danger sense accentuated by frustration, Odrade stood and kicked at the threshold beside the etched word. It moved! Something grated roughly against sand over her head.\n Odrade dodged backward as sand cascaded onto the floor in front of her. A deep rumbling sound filled the tiny chamber. The stones shook under her feet. The floor tipped downward in front of her toward the doorway, opening a space under the door and its wall.\n Once more, Odrade found herself precipitated forward and down into an unknown. Her light tumbled with her, its beam rolling over and over. She saw mounds of dark reddish brown in front of her. Cinnamon filled her nostrils.\n She fell beside her light onto a soft mounding of melange. The opening through which she had fallen lay out of reach some five meters overhead. She grabbed up her light. Its beam picked out wide stone steps cut into the rock beside the opening. Something written on the risers but she saw only that there was a way out. Her first panic subsided, but the sense of danger left her almost breathless, forcing the movements of her chest muscles.\n Left and right she sent the beam of her light into this place where she had fallen. It was a long room directly beneath the passage she had taken from the great chamber. The entire length of it was piled with melange!\n Odrade probed upward with her light and saw why no searcher tapping on that passage floor overhead had detected this chamber. Criss-crossed rock bracings transferred all strain deep into the stone walls. Anyone tapping overhead would get back the sounds of solid rock.\n Once more, Odrade looked at the melange around her. Even at today\u0027s tank-deflated prices, she knew she was standing on a treasure. This hoard would measure many long tons.\n Is that the danger?\n The warning sense within her remained just as acute as ever. The Tyrant\u0027s melange was not what she should fear. The triumvirate would make an equitable distribution of this lot and that would be the end of it. A bonus in the ghola project.\n Another danger remained. She could not avoid the warning.\n Again, she sent the light beam along the mounded melange. Her attention was drawn to the strip of wall above the spice. More words! Still in Chakobsa, written with a cutter in a fine flowing script, there was another message:\n \"A REVEREND MOTHER WILL READ MY WORDS!\"\n Something cold settled in Odrade\u0027s guts. She moved to her right with the light, plowing through an empire\u0027s ransom in melange. There was more to the message:\n \"I BEQUEATH TO YOU MY FEAR AND LONELINESS. TO YOU I GIVE THE CERTAINTY THAT THE BODY AND SOUL OF THE BENE GESSERIT WILL MEET THE SAME FATE AS ALL OTHER BODIES AND ALL OTHER SOULS.\"\n Another paragraph of the message beckoned to the right of this one. She plowed through the cloying melange and stopped to read.\n \"WHAT IS SURVIVAL IF YOU DO NOT SURVIVE WHOLE? ASK THE BENE TLEILAX THAT! WHAT IF YOU NO LONGER HEAR THE MUSIC OF LIFE? MEMORIES ARE NOT ENOUGH UNLESS THEY CALL YOU TO NOBLE PURPOSE!\"\n There was more of it on the narrow end wall of the long chamber. Odrade stumbled through the melange and knelt to read:\n \"WHY DID YOUR SISTERHOOD NOT BUILD THE GOLDEN PATH? YOU KNEW THE NECESSITY. YOUR FAILURE CONDEMNED ME, THE GOD EMPEROR, TO MILLENNIA OF PERSONAL DESPAIR.\"\n The words \"God Emperor\" were not in Chakobsa but in the language of the Islamiyat, where they conveyed an explicit second meaning to any speaker of that tongue:\n \"Your God and Your Emperor because you made me so.\"\n Odrade smiled grimly. That would drive Waff into a religious frenzy! The higher he went, the easier to shatter his security.\n She did not doubt the accuracy of the Tyrant\u0027s accusation, nor the potential in his prediction that the Sisterhood could end. The sense of danger had led her to this place unerringly. Something more had been at work, too. The worms of Rakis still moved to the Tyrant\u0027s ancient beat. He might slumber in his endless dream but monstrous life, a pearl in each worm to remind it, carried on as the Tyrant had predicted.\n What was it he had told the Sisterhood in his own time? She recalled his words:\n \"When I am gone, they must call me Shaitan, Emperor of Gehenna. The wheel must turn and turn along the Golden Path.\"\n Yes - that was what Taraza had meant. \"But don\u0027t you see? The common people of Rakis have been calling him Shaitan for more than a thousand years.\"\n So Taraza had known this thing. Without ever seeing these words, she had known.\n I see your design, Taraza. And now I know the burden of fear you have carried all these years. I can feel it every bit as deeply as you do.\n Odrade knew then that this warning sense would not leave until she ended, or the Sisterhood vanished from existence, or the peril was resolved.\n Odrade lifted her light, got to her feet and slogged through the melange to the wide steps out of this place. At the steps, she recoiled. More of the Tyrant\u0027s words had been cut into each riser. Trembling, she read them as they moved upward to the opening.\n \"MY WORDS ARE YOUR PAST,\n \"MY QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLE:\n \"WITH WHOM DO YOU ALLY?\n \"WITH THE SELF-IDOLATORS OF TLEILAX?\n \"WITH MY FISH SPEAKER BUREAUCRACY?\n \"WITH THE COSMOS-WANDERING GUILD?\n \"WITH HARKONNEN BLOOD SACRIFICERS?\n \"WITH A DOGMATIC SINK OF YOUR OWN CREATION?\n \"HOW WILL YOU MEET YOUR END?\n \"AS NO MORE THAN A SECRET SOCIETY?\"\n Odrade climbed past the questions, reading them a second time as she went. Noble purpose? What a fragile thing that always was. And how easily distorted. But the power was there immersed in constant peril. It was all spelled out on the walls and stairs of that chamber. Taraza knew without having it explained. The Tyrant\u0027s meaning was clear:\n \"Join me!\"\n As she emerged into the small room, finding a narrow ledge along which she could swing herself to the door, Odrade looked down at the treasure she had found. She shook her head in wonder at Taraza\u0027s wisdom. So that was how the Sisterhood might end. Taraza\u0027s design was clear, all the pieces in place. Nothing certain. Wealth and power, it was all the same in the end. The noble design had been started and it must be completed even if that meant the death of the Sisterhood.\n What poor tools we have chosen!\n That girl waiting back there in the deep chamber below the desert, that girl and the ghola being prepared on Rakis.\n I speak your language now, old worm. It has no words but I know the heart of it.\n Our fathers ate manna in the desert,\n In the burning place where whirlwinds came.\n Lord, save us from that horrible land!\n Save us, oh-h-h-h-h save us\n From that dry and thirsty land.\n - Songs of Gurney Halleck, Museum of Dar-es-Balat\n Teg and Duncan, both heavily armed, emerged from the no-globe with Lucilla into the coldest part of the night. The stars were like needlepoints overhead, the air absolutely still until they disturbed it.\n The dominant smell in Teg\u0027s nostrils was the brittle mustiness of snow. The odor infused every breath and when they exhaled, fat clouds of vapor puffed around their faces.\n Tears of cold started in Duncan\u0027s eyes. He had been thinking much of old Gurney as they prepared to leave the no-globe, Gurney with his cheek scarred by a Harkonnen inkvine whip. Trusted companions would be needed now, Duncan thought. He did not trust Lucilla much and Teg was old, old. Duncan could see Teg\u0027s eyes glinting in the starlight.\n Slinging a heavy antique lasgun over his left shoulder, Duncan thrust his hands deep into his pockets for warmth. He had forgotten how cold this planet could get. Lucilla seemed impervious to it, obviously drawing warmth from one of her Bene Gesserit tricks.\n Looking at her, Duncan realized he had never trusted the witches much, not even the Lady Jessica. It was easy to think of them as traitors, devoid of any loyalty except to their own Sisterhood. They had so damned many secret tricks! Lucilla had given up her seductive ways, though. She knew he meant what he had said. He could feel her anger simmering. Let her simmer!\n Teg stood quite still, his attention focused outward, listening. Was it right to trust the single plan he and Burzmali had worked out? They had no backup. Was it only eight days ago they had settled on it? It felt longer despite the press of preparations. He glanced at Duncan and Lucilla. Duncan carried a heavy old Harkonnen lasgun, the long field model. Even the extra charge cartridges were heavy. Lucilla had refused to carry more than a single tiny lasgun in her bodice. One small burst was all it held. An assassin\u0027s toy.\n \"We of the Sisterhood are noted for going into battle with only our skills as weapons,\" she said. \"It diminishes us to change that pattern.\"\n She had knives in her leg sheaths, though. Teg had seen them. Poison on them, too, he suspected.\n Teg hefted the long weapon in his own hands: a modern field-style lasgun he had brought from the Keep. Over his shoulder, a mate to Duncan\u0027s weapon hung from its sling.\n I must rely on Burzmali, Teg told himself. I trained him; I know his qualities. If he says we trust these new allies, we trust them.\n Burzmali had been obviously overjoyed to find his old commander alive and safe.\n But it had snowed since their last encounter and the snow lay all around them, a tabula rasa upon which all tracks would be written. They had not counted on snow. Were there traitors in Weather Management?\n Teg shivered. The air was cold. It felt like the chill of off-planet space, empty and giving starlight free access to the forest glade around them. The thin light reflected cleanly off the snow-covered ground and the white dusting on the rocks. Dark outlines of conifers and the leafless branches of deciduous trees displayed only their whitely diffused edges. All else was deepest shadow.\n Lucilla blew on her fingers and leaned close to Teg to whisper: \"Shouldn\u0027t he be here by now?\"\n He knew that was not her real question. \"Can Burzmali be trusted?\" That was her question. She had been asking it one way and another ever since Teg had explained the plan to her eight days ago.\n All he could say was: \"I have staked my life on it.\"\n \"Our lives, too!\"\n Teg too disliked the accumulated uncertainties, but all plans relied ultimately on the skills of those who executed them.\n \"You\u0027re the one who insisted we must get out of there and go on to Rakis,\" he reminded her. He hoped she could see his smile, a gesture to take the sting out of his words.\n Lucilla was not placated. Teg had never seen a Reverend Mother this obviously nervous. She would be even more nervous if she knew of their new allies! Of course, there was the fact that she had failed to carry out her full assignment from Taraza. How that must gall her!\n \"We took an oath to protect the ghola,\" she reminded him.\n \"Burzmali has taken that same oath.\"\n Teg glanced at Duncan standing silently between them. Duncan gave no sign that he heard the argument or shared the nervousness. An ancient composure held his features motionless. He was listening to the night, Teg realized, doing what all three of them should be doing just now. There was an odd look of ageless maturity on his young features.\n If ever I needed trusted companions, it\u0027s now! Duncan thought. His mind had gone questing backward into the Giedi Prime days of his pre-ghola roots. This was what they had called \"a Harkonnen night.\" Safe within the warm shielding of their suspensor-buoyed armor, the Harkonnens had enjoyed hunting their subjects on such nights. A wounded fugitive could die of the cold. The Harkonnens knew! Damn their souls!\n Predictably, Lucilla caught Duncan\u0027s attention with a look that said: \"We have unfinished business, you and I.\"\n Duncan turned his face up into the starlight, making sure she could see his smile, an offensive and knowing look that caused Lucilla to stiffen inwardly. He slipped the heavy lasgun from his shoulder and checked it. She noted the ornate scrollwork on its stock and along the barrel. It was an antique but still it gave off a deadly sense of purpose. Duncan rested it over his left arm, right hand on the grip, finger on the trigger, exactly as Teg was carrying his own modern weapon.\n Lucilla turned her back on her companions and sent her senses probing onto the hillside above them and below. Even as she moved, sound erupted all around. Globs of sound filled their night - a great burst of rumblings off to the right, then silence. Another burst from downslope. Silence. From upslope! On all sides!\n At the first sound, all three of them crouched into the shelter of the rocks outside the no-globe\u0027s cave entrance.\n The sounds filling their night carried little definition: intrusive racketing, partly mechanical, partly squeaks and wails and hisses. Intermittently, a subterranean drumming made the ground vibrate.\n Teg knew these sounds. There was a battle going on out there. He could hear the background hissing of burners and, in the distant sky, the lancing beams of armored lasguns.\n Something flashed overhead -trailing blue and red sparks. Another and another! The earth trembled. Teg inhaled through his nose: burned acid and a suggestion of garlic.\n No-ships! Many of them!\n They were landing in the valley below the ancient no-globe.\n \"Back inside!\" Teg ordered.\n As he spoke, he saw it was too late. People were moving in from all around them. Teg lifted his long lasgun and aimed it downslope toward the loudest of the intrusive noises and the nearest detectable movement. Many people could be heard shouting down there. Free glowglobes moved among the screening trees, set loose by whoever came from there. The dancing lights drifted upslope on a cold breeze. Dark figures moved in the shifting illumination.\n \"Face Dancers!\" Teg grunted, recognizing the attackers. Those drifting lights would be clear of the trees within seconds and on his position in less than a minute!\n \"We\u0027ve been betrayed!\" Lucilla said.\n A great shout roared from the hill above them: \"Bashar!\" Many voices!\n Burzmali? Teg asked himself. He glanced back in that direction and then down at the steadily advancing Face Dancers. No time to pick and choose. He leaned toward Lucilla. \"That\u0027s Burzmali above us. Take Duncan and run!\"\n \"But what if -\"\n \"It\u0027s your only chance!\"\n \"You fool!\" she accused, even as she turned to obey.\n Teg\u0027s \"Yes!\" did nothing to ease her fears. This was what came of depending on the plans of others!\n Duncan had other thoughts. He understood what Teg was about to do - sacrifice himself that two might escape. Duncan hesitated, looking at the advancing attackers below them.\n Seeing the hesitation, Teg blared at him: \"This is a battle order! I am your commander!\"\n It was the closest thing to Voice Lucilla had ever heard from a man. She gaped at Teg.\n Duncan saw only the face of the Old Duke telling him to obey. It was too much. He grabbed Lucilla\u0027s arm, but before hustling her up the slope, he said: \"We\u0027ll lay down a covering fire once we\u0027re clear!\"\n Teg did not respond. He crouched against a snow-dusted rock as Lucilla and Duncan scrambled away. He knew he must sell himself dearly now. And there must be something else: the unexpected. A final signature from the old Bashar.\n The advancing attackers were coming up faster, exchanging excited shouts.\n Setting his lasgun on maxibeam, Teg pressed the trigger. A fiery arc swept across the slope below him. Trees burst into flame and crashed. People screamed. The weapon would not perform long at this discharge level but while it did the carnage produced its desired effect.\n In the abrupt silence after that first sweep, Teg shifted his position to another screening rock on his left and again sent a flaming lance down the dark slope. Only a few of the drifting glowglobes had survived that first slashing violence with its falling trees and dismembered bodies.\n More screams greeted his second counterattack. He turned and scrambled across the rocks to the other side of the no-globe\u0027s access cave. There, he sent sweeping fire down the opposite slope. More screams. More flames and crashing trees.\n No answering fire came back.\n They want us alive!\n The Tleilaxu were prepared to spend whatever number of Face Dancer lives it required to run his lasgun out of its charges!\n Teg shifted the sling of the old Harkonnen weapon to a better position on his shoulder, getting it ready to swing into action. He discarded the almost empty charge in his modern lasgun, recharged it and rested the weapon across the rocks. Teg doubted he would get the chance to recharge the second weapon. Let them think down there that he had run out of charge cartridges. But there were two Harkonnen handguns in his belt as a last resort. They would be potent at close range. Some of the Tleilaxu Masters, the ones who ordered such carnage, let them come closer!\n Cautiously, Teg lifted his long lasgun from the rock and moved backward, drifting up into the higher rocks, slipping left and then right. He paused twice to sweep the slopes below him with short bursts as though conserving the gun\u0027s charge. There was no sense in trying to conceal his movements. They would have a life-tracer on him by now and, besides, there were the tracks in the snow.\n The unexpected! Could he suck them in close?\n Well above the no-globe\u0027s access cave he found a deeper pocket in the rocks, its bottom filled with snow. Teg dropped into this position, admiring the fine field of fire this new vantage provided. He studied it briefly: protected behind him by higher crags and open downslope on three sides. He lifted his head cautiously and tried to see around the screening rocks upslope.\n Only silence there.\n Had that shout come from Burzmali\u0027s people? Even so, there was no guarantee that Duncan and Lucilla could escape in these circumstances. It depended on Burzmali now.\n Is he as resourceful as I always thought?\n There was no time to consider the possibilities or change a single element of the situation. Battle had been joined. He was committed. Teg drew a deep breath and peered downslope over the rocks.\n Yes, they had recovered and were resuming the advance. Without telltale glowglobes this time and silently now. No more shouts of encouragement. Teg rested the long lasgun on a rock in front of him and swept a burning arc from left to right in one long burst, letting it fade out at the end in an obvious loss of charge.\n Unslinging the old Harkonnen weapon, he readied it, waiting in silence. They would expect him to flee up the hill. He crouched behind the screening rocks, hoping there was enough movement above him to confuse the life-tracers. He still heard people below him on that fire-wracked slope. Teg counted silently to himself, spacing out the distance, knowing from long experience how much time the attackers would require to come within deadly range. And he listened carefully for another sound he knew from previous encounters with the Tleilaxu: the sharp barking of commands in high-pitched voices.\n There they were!\n The Masters were spread out farther downslope than he had anticipated. Fearful creatures! Teg set the old lasgun on maxibeam and lifted himself suddenly from his protective cradle in the rocks.\n He saw the arc of advancing Face Dancers in the light of burning trees and brush. The high-pitched voices of command came from behind the advance, well out of the dancing orange light.\n Aiming over the heads of the nearest attackers, Teg sighted beyond the jumble of flames and pressed the trigger: two long bursts, back and forth. He was momentarily surprised by the extent of the destructive energy in the antique weapon. The thing obviously was the product of superb craftsmanship but there had been no way to test it in the no-globe.\n This time, the screams carried a different pitch: high and frantic!\n Teg lowered his aim and cleared the immediate slope of Face Dancers, letting them feel the full force of the beam, revealing that he carried more than one weapon. Back and forth he swept the deadly arc, giving the attackers plenty of time to see the charge ebb into a final sputter.\n Now! They had been sucked in once and would be more cautious. There just might be a chance to join Duncan and Lucilla. This thought full in his mind, Teg turned and scrambled out of his shelter across the upslope rocks. At his fifth step, he thought he had run into a hot wall. There was time for his mind to recognize what had happened: the shocking blast of a stunner full into his face and chest! It came from directly upslope where he had sent Duncan and Lucilla. Chagrin filled Teg as he fell into darkness.\n Others could do the unexpected, too!\n All organized religions face a common problem, a tender spot through which we may enter and shift them to our designs: How do they distinguish hubris from revelation?\n - Missionaria Protectiva, the Inner Teachings\n Odrade kept her gaze carefully away from the cool green of the quadrangle below her where Sheeana sat with one of the teaching Sisters. The teaching Sister was the best, precisely fitted to this next phase in Sheeana\u0027s education. Taraza had chosen them all with care.\n We proceed with your plan, Odrade thought. But did you anticipate, Mother Superior, how we might be marked by a chance discovery here on Rakis?\n Or was it chance?\n Odrade sent her gaze over the lower rooftops to the spread of the Sisterhood\u0027s central stronghold on Rakis. Rainbow tiles baked out there in glaring noon light.\n All of this ours.\n This was, she knew, quite the largest embassy the priests permitted in their holy city of Keen. And her presence in this Bene Gesserit stronghold defied the agreement she had made with Tuek. But that had been before the discoveries at Sietch Tabr. Besides, Tuek no longer really existed. The Tuek who marched the priestly precincts was a Face Dancer living out a precarious charade.\n Odrade brought her thoughts back to Waff, who stood with two guardian Sisters, behind her, waiting near the door of this penthouse sanctuary with its fine view through armor-plaz windows and its impressive black furnishings into which a robed Reverend Mother might blend with only the lighter shades of her face visible to a visitor.\n Had she gauged Waff correctly? Everything had been done precisely according to Missionaria Protectiva teachings. Had she opened the crack in his psychic armor sufficiently? He should be goaded to speak soon. Then she would know.\n Waff stood back there calmly enough. She could see his reflection in the plaz. He gave no sign of understanding that the two tall, dark-haired Sisters flanking him were there to prevent his possible violence. But he certainly knew.\n My guardians, not his.\n He stood with his head bent to conceal his features from her but she knew he was uncertain. That part was sure. Doubts could be like a starving animal and she had fed those hungry doubts well. He had been so sure that their venture into the desert would be the occasion for his death. His Zensunni and Sufi beliefs were telling him now that God\u0027s will preserved him there.\n Surely, though, Waff was reviewing now his agreement with the Bene Gesserit, seeing at last the ways he had compromised his people, how he had put his precious Tleilaxu civilization in terrible jeopardy. Yes, his composure was wearing thin, but only Bene Gesserit eyes detected this. It would be time soon to begin rebuilding his awareness into a pattern more amenable to the Sisterhood\u0027s needs. Let him stew a bit longer.\n Odrade returned her attention to the view, loading the suspense of this delay. The Bene Gesserit had chosen this embassy location because of the extensive rebuilding that had changed the entire northeastern quarter of the old city. They could build and remodel here in their own way and for their own purposes. Ancient structures designed for easy access by people on foot, wide lanes for official groundcars and occasional squares in which ornithopters might land - all of that had been changed.\n Keeping up with the times.\n These new buildings stood much closer to the green-planted avenues whose tall and exotic trees flaunted their enormous water consumption. \u0027Thopters were relegated to rooftop landing pads on selected buildings. Pedestrian lanes clung to narrow elevations attached to the buildings. Coin-operated, key-operated and palm-identification liftslots had been inset into the new buildings, their glowing energy fields masked by dark brown, vaguely transparent covers. The liftslots were spines of darker color in the flat gray of plascrete and plaz. Humans dimly seen in the tubes gave the effect of impurities moving up and down in otherwise pure mechanical sausages.\n All in the name of modernization.\n Waff stirred behind her and cleared his throat.\n Odrade did not turn. The two guardian Sisters knew what she was doing and gave no sign. Waff\u0027s mounting nervousness was merely confirmation that all went well.\n Odrade did not feel that all was going truly well.\n She interpreted the view out her window as just another disquieting symptom of this disquieting planet. Tuek, she recalled, had not liked this modernization of his city. He had complained that some way must be found to stop it and preserve the old landmarks. His Face Dancer replacement continued that argument.\n How like Tuek himself this new Face Dancer was. Did such Face Dancers think for themselves or just play out their parts in accordance with a Master\u0027s orders? Were they still mules, these new ones? How much different were these Face Dancers from the fully human?\n Things about the deception worried Odrade.\n The false Tuek\u0027s councillors, the ones fully involved in what they thought of as \"the Tleilaxu plot,\" spoke of public support for modernization and openly gloated that they had their way at last. Albertus regularly reported everything to Odrade. Each new report worried her more. Even the obvious subservience of Albertus bothered her.\n \"Of course, the councillors do not mean public public support,\" Albertus said.\n She could only agree. The behavior of the councillors signaled that they had powerful backing among the middle echelons of the priesthood, among the climbers who dared joke about their Divided God at weekend parties... among those being soothed by the hoard Odrade had found at Sietch Tabr.\n Ninety thousand long tons! Half a year\u0027s harvest from the deserts of Rakis. Even a third of it represented a significant bargaining chip in the new balances.\n I wish I had never met you, Albertus.\n She had wanted to restore in him the one who cares. What she had actually done was easily recognized by one trained in the Missionaria Protectiva\u0027s ways.\n A groveling sycophant!\n It made no difference now that his subservience was driven by an absolute belief in her holy association with Sheeana. Odrade had never before focused on how easily the Missionaria Protectiva\u0027s teachings destroyed human independence. That was always the goal, of course: Make them followers, obedient to our needs.\n The Tyrant\u0027s words in that secret chamber had done more than ignite her fears for the Sisterhood\u0027s future.\n \"I bequeath to you my fear and loneliness.\"\n From that millennial distance, he had planted doubts in her as surely as she had planted them in Waff.\n She saw the Tyrant\u0027s questions as though they had been limned with glowing light on her inner eye.\n \"WITH WHOM DO YOU ALLY?\"\n Are we no more than a secret society? How will we meet our end? In a dogmatic stink of our own creation?\n The Tyrant\u0027s words had been burned into her consciousness. Where was the \"noble purpose\" in what the Sisterhood did? Odrade could almost hear Taraza\u0027s sneering response to such a question.\n \"Survival, Dar! That\u0027s all the noble purpose we need. Survival! Even the Tyrant knew that!\"\n Perhaps even Tuek had known it. And what had that bought him in the end?\n Odrade felt a haunting sympathy for the late High Priest. Tuek had been a superb example of what a tightly knit family could produce. Even his name was a clue: unchanged from Atreides days on this planet. The founding ancestor had been a smuggler, confidant of the first Leto. Tuek had come from a family that held firmly to its roots, saying: \"There is something worth preserving in our past.\" The example this set for descendants was not lost on a Reverend Mother.\n But you failed, Tuek.\n These blocks of modernization visible out her window were a sign of that failure - sops to the rising power elements in Rakian society, those elements that the Sisterhood had worked so long to foster and strengthen. Tuek had seen this as a harbinger of the day when he would be too weak politically to prevent the things implied by such modernization:\n A shorter and more upbeat ritual.\n New songs, more in the modern manner.\n Changes in the dancing. (\"Traditional dances take so long!\") Above all, fewer ventures into the dangerous desert for the young postulants from the powerful families.\n Odrade sighed and glanced back at Waff. The little Tleilaxu chewed his lower lip. Good!\n Damn you, Albertus! I would welcome your rebellion!\n Behind the closed doors of the Temple, the transition of the High Priesthood already was being debated. The new Rakians spoke of the need \"to keep up with the times.\" They meant: \"Give us more power!\"\n It has always been this way, Odrade thought. Even in the Bene Gesserit.\n Still, she could not escape the thought: poor Tuek.\n Albertus reported that Tuek, just before his death and replacement by the Face Dancer, had warned his kin they might not retain familial control of the High Priesthood when he died. Tuek had been more subtle and resourceful than his enemies expected. His family already was calling in its debts, gathering its resources to retain a power base.\n And the Face Dancer in Tuek\u0027s place revealed much by his mimic performance. The Tuek family had not yet learned of the substitution and one might almost believe the original High Priest had not been replaced, so good was this Face Dancer. Observing that Face Dancer in action betrayed much to the watchful Reverend Mothers. That, of course, was one of the things that had Waff squirming now.\n Odrade turned abruptly on one heel and strode across to the Tleilaxu Master. Time to have at him!\n She stopped two paces from Waff and glared down at him. Waff met her gaze with defiance.\n \"You\u0027ve had enough time to consider your position,\" she accused. \"Why do you remain silent?\"\n \"My position? You think you give us a choice?\"\n \"Man is but a pebble dropped in a pool,\" she quoted at him from his own beliefs.\n Waff took a trembling breath. She spoke the proper words, but what lay behind such words? They no longer sounded right coming from the mouth of a powindah woman.\n When Waff did not respond, Odrade continued her quotation: \"And if man is but a pebble, then all his works can be no more.\"\n An involuntary shudder swept through Odrade, causing a look of carefully masked surprise in the watchful guardian Sisters. That shudder was not part of the required performance.\n Why do I think of the Tyrant\u0027s words at this moment?\n Odrade wondered.\n \"THE BODY AND SOUL OF THE BENE GESSERIT WILL MEET THE SAME FATE AS ALL OTHER BODIES AND ALL OTHER SOULS.\"\n His barb had gone deep into her.\n How was I made so vulnerable? The answer leaped into her awareness: The Atreides Manifesto!\n Composing those words under Taraza\u0027s watchful guidance opened a flaw within me.\n Could that have been Taraza\u0027s purpose: to make Odrade vulnerable? How could Taraza have known what would be found here on Rakis? The Mother Superior not only displayed no prescient abilities, she tended to avoid this talent in others.
