{"id":97414,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"The driver drew up to the curb in front of a windowless building face, all flat black plasteel and with a single ground-level door. No salvaged material in this construction. Teg recognized the place: the bolt hole he had chosen. Unidentified things flickered in Teg\u0027s second vision but he sensed no immediate menace. The driver opened Teg\u0027s door and stood to one side.\\n\\n \"Not much activity here at this hour, sir. I would get inside quickly.\"\\n\\n Without a backward glance, Teg darted across the narrow walk and into the building - a small brightly lighted foyer of polished white plaz and only banks of comeyes to greet him. He ducked into a lift tube and punched the remembered coordinates. This tube, he knew, angled upward through the building to the fifty-seventh floor rear where there were some windows. He remembered a private dining room of dark reds and heavy brown furnishings, a hard-eyed female with the obvious signs of Bene Gesserit training, but no Reverend Mother.\\n\\n The tube disgorged him into the remembered room but there was no one to receive him. Teg glanced around at the solid brown furnishings. Four windows along the far wall were concealed behind thick maroon draperies.\\n\\n Teg knew he had been seen. He waited patiently, using his newly learned doubling-vision to anticipate trouble. There was no indication of attack. He took up a position to one side of the tube outlet and glanced around him once more.\\n\\n Teg had a theory about the relationship between rooms and their windows - the number of windows, their placement, their size, height from the floor, relationship of room size to window size, the elevation of the room, windows curtained or draped, and all of this Mentat-interpreted against knowledge of the uses to which a room was put. Rooms could be fitted to a kind of pecking order defined with extreme sophistication. Emergency uses might throw such distinctions out the window but they otherwise were quite reliable.\\n\\n Lack of windows in an aboveground room conveyed a particular message. If humans occupied such a room, it did not necessarily mean secrecy was the main goal. He had seen unmistakable signs in scholastic settings that windowless schoolrooms were both a retreat from the exterior world and a strong statement of dislike for children.\\n\\n This room, however, presented something different: conditional secrecy plus the need to keep occasional watch on that exterior world. Protective secrecy when required. His opinion was reinforced when he crossed the room and twitched one of the draperies aside. The windows were tripled armor-plaz. So! Keeping watch on that world outside might draw attack. That was the opinion of whoever had ordered the room protected this way.\\n\\n Once more, Teg twitched the drapery aside. He glanced at the corner glazing. Prismatic reflectors there amplified the view along the adjacent wall to both sides and from roof to ground.\\n\\n Well!\\n\\n His previous visit had not given him time for this closer examination but now he made a more positive assessment. A very interesting room. Teg dropped the drapery and turned just in time to see a tall man enter from the tube slot.\\n\\n Teg\u0027s doubled vision provided a firm prediction on the stranger. This man brought concealed danger. The newcomer was plainly military - the way he carried himself, the quick eye for details that only a trained and experienced officer would observe. And there was something else in his manner that made Teg stiffen. This was a betrayer! A mercenary available to the highest bidder.\\n\\n \"Damned nasty the way they treated you,\" the man greeted Teg. The voice was a deep baritone with an unconscious assumption of personal power in it. The accent was one Teg had never before heard. This was someone from the Scattering! A Bashar or equivalent, Teg estimated.\\n\\n Still, there was no indication of immediate attack.\\n\\n When Teg did not answer, the man said: \"Oh, sorry: I\u0027m Muzzafar. Jafa Muzzafar, regional commander for the forces of Dur.\"\\n\\n Teg had never heard of the forces of Dur.\\n\\n Questions crowded Teg\u0027s mind but he kept them to himself. Anything he said here might betray weakness.\\n\\n Where were the people who had met him here before? Why did I choose this place? The decision had been made with such inner assurance.\\n\\n \"Please be comfortable,\" Muzzafar said, indicating a small divan with a low serving table in front of it. \"I assure you that none of what has happened to you was of my doing. Tried to put a stop to it when I heard but you\u0027d already... left the scene.\"\\n\\n Teg heard the other thing in this Muzzafar\u0027s voice now: caution bordering on fear. So this man had either heard about or seen the shack and the clearing.\\n\\n \"Damned clever of you,\" Muzzafar said. \"Having your attack force wait until your captors were concentrating on trying to get information out of you. Did they learn anything?\"\\n\\n Teg shook his head silently from side to side. He felt on the edge of being ignited in a blurred response to attack, yet he sensed no immediate violence here. What were these Lost Ones doing? But Muzzafar and his people had made a wrong assessment of what had happened in the room of the T-probe. That was clear.\\n\\n \"Please, be seated,\" Muzzafar said.\\n\\n Teg took the proffered seat on the divan.\\n\\n Muzzafar sat in a deep chair facing Teg at a slight angle on the other side of the serving table. There was a crouching sense of alertness in Muzzafar. He was prepared for violence.\\n\\n Teg studied the man with interest. Muzzafar had revealed no real rank - only commander. Tall fellow with a wide, ruddy face and a big nose. The eyes were gray-green and had the trick of focusing just behind Teg\u0027s right shoulder when either of them spoke. Teg had known a spy once who did that.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" Muzzafar said. \"I\u0027ve read and heard a great deal about you since coming here.\"\\n\\n Teg continued to study him silently. Muzzafar\u0027s hair had been cropped close and there was a purple scar about three millimeters long across the scalp line above the left eye. He wore an open bush jacket of light green and matching trousers - not quite a uniform but there was a neatness about him that spoke of customary spit and polish. The shoes attested to this. Teg thought he probably could see his own reflection in their light brown surfaces if he bent close.\\n\\n \"Never expected to meet you personally, of course,\" Muzzafar said. \"Consider it a great honor.\"\\n\\n \"I know very little about you except that you command a force from the Scattering,\" Teg said.\\n\\n \"Mmmmmph! Not much to know, really.\"\\n\\n Once more, hunger pangs gripped Teg. His gaze went to the button beside the tube slot, which, he remembered, would summon a waiter. This was a place where humans did the work usually assigned to automata, an excuse for keeping a large force assembled at the ready.\\n\\n Misinterpreting Teg\u0027s interest in the tube slot, Muzzafar said: \"Please don\u0027t think of leaving. Having my own medic come in to take a look at you. Shouldn\u0027t be but a moment. Appreciate it if you\u0027d wait quietly until he arrives.\"\\n\\n \"I was merely thinking of placing an order for some food,\" Teg said.\\n\\n \"Advise you to wait until the doctor\u0027s had his look-see. Stunners leave some nasty aftereffects.\"\\n\\n \"So you know about that.\"\\n\\n \"Know about the whole damned fiasco. You and your man Burzmali are a force to be reckoned with.\"\\n\\n Before Teg could respond, the tube slot disgorged a tall man in a jacketed red singlesuit, a man so bone-skinny that his clothing gaped and flapped about him. The diamond tattoo of a Suk doctor had been burned into his high forehead but the mark was orange and not the customary black. The doctor\u0027s eyes were concealed by a glistening orange cover that hid their true color.\\n\\n An addict of some kind? Teg wondered. There was no smell of the familiar narcotics around him, not even melange. There was a tart smell, though, almost like some fruit.\\n\\n \"There you are, Solitz!\" Muzzafar said. He gestured at Teg. \"Give him a good scan. Stunner hit him day before yesterday.\"\\n\\n Solitz produced a recognizable Suk scanner, compact and fitting into one hand. Its probe field produced a low hum.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re a Suk doctor,\" Teg said, looking pointedly at the orange brand on the forehead.\\n\\n \"Yes, Bashar. My training and conditioning are the finest in our ancient tradition.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never seen the identifying mark in that color,\" Teg said.\\n\\n The doctor passed his scanner around Teg\u0027s head. \"The color of the tattoo makes no difference, Bashar. What is behind it is all that matters.\" He lowered the scanner to Teg\u0027s shoulders, then down across the body.\\n\\n Teg waited for the humming to stop.\\n\\n The doctor stood back and addressed Muzzafar: \"He is quite fit, Field Marshal. Remarkably fit, considering his age, but he desperately needs sustenance.\"\\n\\n \"Yes... well, that\u0027s fine then, Solitz. Take care of that. The Bashar is our guest.\"\\n\\n \"I will order a meal suited to his needs,\" Solitz said. \"Eat it slowly, Bashar.\" Solitz did a smart about-face that set his jacket and trousers flapping. The tube slot swallowed him.\\n\\n \"Field Marshal?\" Teg asked.\\n\\n \"A revival of ancient titles in the Dur,\" Muzzafar said.\\n\\n \"The Dur?\" Teg ventured.\\n\\n \"Stupid of me!\" Muzzafar produced a small case from a side pocket of his jacket and extracted a thin folder. Teg recognized a holostat similar to one he had carried himself during his long service - pictures of home and family. Muzzafar placed the holostat on the table between them and tapped the control button.\\n\\n The full-color image of a bushy green expanse of jungle came alive in miniature above the tabletop.\\n\\n \"Home,\" Muzzafar said. \"Frame bush in the center there.\" A finger indicated a place in the projection. \"First one that ever obeyed me. People laughed at me for choosing the first one that way and sticking with it.\"\\n\\n Teg stared at the projection, aware of a deep sadness in Muzzafar\u0027s voice. The indicated bush was a spindly grouping of thin limbs with bright blue bulbs dangling from the tips.\\n\\n Frame bush?\\n\\n \"Rather thin thing, I know,\" Muzzafar said, removing his pointing finger from the projection. \"Not secure at all. Had to defend myself a few times in the first months with it. Grew rather fond of it, though. They respond to that, you know. It\u0027s the best home in all the deep valleys now, by the Eternal Rock of Dur!\"\\n\\n Muzzafar stared at Teg\u0027s puzzled expression. \"Damn! You don\u0027t have frame bushes, of course. You must forgive my crashing ignorance. We\u0027ve a great deal to teach each other, I think.\"\\n\\n \"You called that home,\" Teg said.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. With proper direction, once they learn to obey, of course, a frame bush will grow itself into a magnificent residence. It only takes four or five standards.\"\\n\\n Standards, Teg thought. So the Lost Ones still used the Standard Year.\\n\\n The tube slot hissed and a young woman in a blue serving gown backed into the room towing a suspensor-buoyed hotpod, which she positioned near the table in front of Teg. Her clothing was of the type Teg had seen during his original inspection but the pleasantly round face she turned to him was unfamiliar. Her scalp had been depilated, leaving an expanse of prominent veins. Her eyes were watery blue and there was something cowed in her posture. She opened the hotpod and the spicy odors of the food wafted across Teg\u0027s nostrils.\\n\\n Teg was alerted but he sensed no immediate threat. He could see himself eating the food without ill effect.\\n\\n The young woman put a row of dishes on to the table in front of him and arranged the eating implements neatly at one side.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no snooper, but I\u0027ll taste the foods if you wish,\" Muzzafar said.\\n\\n \"Not necessary,\" Teg said. He knew this would raise questions but felt they would suspect him of being a Truthsayer. Teg\u0027s gaze locked onto the food. Without any conscious decision, he leaned forward and began eating. Familiar with Mentat-hunger, he was surprised at his own reactions. Using the brain in Mentat mode consumed calories at an alarming rate, but this was a new necessity driving him. He felt his own survival controlling his actions. This hunger went beyond anything of previous experience. The soup he had eaten with some caution at the house of the ruined man had not aroused such a demanding reaction.\\n\\n The Suk doctor chose correctly, Teg thought. This food had been selected directly out of the scanner\u0027s summation.\\n\\n The young woman kept bringing more dishes from hotpods ordered via the tube slot.\\n\\n Teg had to get up in the middle of the meal and relieve himself in an adjoining washroom, conscious there of the hidden comeyes that were keeping him under surveillance. He knew by his physical reactions that his digestive system had speeded up to a new level of bodily necessity. When he returned to the table, he felt just as hungry as though he had not eaten.\\n\\n The serving woman began to show signs of surprise and then alarm. Still, she kept bringing more food at his demand. Muzzafar watched with growing amazement but said nothing.\\n\\n Teg felt the supportive replacement of the food, the precise caloric adjustment that the Suk doctor had ordered. They obviously had not thought about quantity, though. The girl obeyed his demands in a kind of walking shock.\\n\\n Muzzafar spoke finally. \"Must say I\u0027ve never before seen anyone eat that much at one sitting. Can\u0027t see how you do it. Nor why.\"\\n\\n Teg sat back, satisfied at last, knowing he had aroused questions that could not be answered truthfully.\\n\\n \"A Mentat thing,\" Teg lied. \"I\u0027ve been through a very strenuous time.\"\\n\\n \"Amazing,\" Muzzafar said. He arose.\\n\\n When Teg started to stand, Muzzafar gestured for him to remain. \"No need. We\u0027ve prepared quarters for you right next door. Safer not to move you yet.\"\\n\\n The young woman departed with the empty hotpods.\\n\\n Teg studied Muzzafar. Something had changed during the meal. Muzzafar watched him with a coldly measuring stare.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve an implanted communicator,\" Teg said. \"You have received new orders.\"\\n\\n \"It would not be advisable for your friends to attack this place,\" Muzzafar said.\\n\\n \"You think that\u0027s my plan?\"\\n\\n \"What is your plan, Bashar?\"\\n\\n Teg smiled.\\n\\n \"Very well.\" Muzzafar\u0027s gaze went out of focus as he listened to his communicator. When he once more concentrated on Teg, his gaze had the look of a predator. Teg felt himself buffeted by that gaze, recognizing that someone else was coming to this room. The Field Marshal thought of this new development as something extremely dangerous to his dinner guest but Teg saw nothing that could defeat his new abilities.\\n\\n \"You think I am your prisoner,\" Teg said.\\n\\n \"By the Eternal Rock, Bashar! You are not what I expected!\"\\n\\n \"The Honored Matre who is coming, what does she expect?\" Teg asked.\\n\\n \"Bashar, I warn you: Do not take that tone with her. You have not the slightest concept of what is about to happen to you.\"\\n\\n \"An Honored Matre is about to happen to me,\" Teg said.\\n\\n \"And I wish you well of her!\"\\n\\n Muzzafar pivoted and left via the tube slot.\\n\\n Teg stared after him. He could see the flickering of second vision like a light blinking around the tube slot. The Honored Matre was near but not yet ready to enter this room. First, she would consult with Muzzafar. The Field Marshal would not be able to tell this dangerous female anything really important.\\n\\n Memory never recaptures reality. Memory reconstructs. All reconstructions change the original, becoming external frames of reference that inevitably fall short.\\n\\n - Mentat Handbook\\n\\n Lucilla and Burzmali entered Ysai from the south into a lowerclass quarter with widely spaced streetlights. It lacked only an hour of midnight and yet people thronged the streets in this quarter. Some walked quietly, some chatted with drug-enhanced vigor, some only watched expectantly. They wadded up at the corners and held Lucilla\u0027s fascinated attention as she passed.\\n\\n Burzmali urged her to walk faster, an eager customer anxious to get her alone. Lucilla kept her covert attention on the people.\\n\\n What did they do here? Those men waiting in the doorway: For what did they wait? Workers in heavy aprons emerged from a wide passage as Lucilla and Burzmali passed. There was a thick smell of rank sewage and perspiration about them. The workers, almost equally divided between male and female, were tall, heavy-bodied and with thick arms. Lucilla could not imagine what their occupation might be but they were of a single type and they made her realize how little she knew of Gammu.\\n\\n The workers hawked and spat into the gutter as they emerged into the night. Ridding themselves of some contaminant?\\n\\n Burzmali put his mouth close to Lucilla\u0027s ear and whispered: \"Those workers are the Bordanos.\"\\n\\n She risked a glance back at them where they walked toward a side street. Bordanos? Ahhh, yes: people trained and bred to work the compression machinery that harnessed sewer gases. They had been bred to remove the sense of smell and the musculature of shoulders and arms had been increased. Burzmali guided her around a corner and out of sight of the Bordanos.\\n\\n Five children emerged from a dark doorway beside them and wheeled into line following Lucilla and Burzmali. Lucilla noted their hands clutching small objects. They followed with a strange intensity. Abruptly, Burzmali stopped and turned. The children also stopped and stared at him. It was clear to Lucilla that the children were prepared for some violence.\\n\\n Burzmali clasped both hands in front of him and bowed to the children. He said: \"Guldur!\"\\n\\n When Burzmali resumed guiding her down the street, the children no longer followed.\\n\\n \"They would have stoned us,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"They are children of a sect that follows Guldur - the local name for the Tyrant.\"\\n\\n Lucilla looked back but the children were no longer in sight. They had set off in search of another victim.\\n\\n Burzmali guided her around another corner. Now, they were in a street crowded with small merchants selling their wares from wheeled stands - food, clothing, small tools, and knives. A singsong of shouts filled the air as the merchants tried to attract buyers. Their voices had that end of the workday lift - a false brilliance composed of the hope that old dreams would be fulfilled, yet colored by the knowledge that life would not change for them. It occurred to Lucilla that the people of these streets pursued a fleeting dream, that the fulfillment they sought was not the thing itself but a myth they had been conditioned to seek the way racing animals were trained to chase after the whirling bait on the endless oval of the racetrack.\\n\\n In the street directly ahead of them a burly figure in a thickly padded coat was engaged in loud-voiced argument with a merchant who offered a string bag filled with the dark red bulbs of a sweetly acid fruit. The fruit smell was thick all around them. The merchant complained: \"You would steal the food from the mouths of my children!\"\\n\\n The bulky figure spoke in a piping voice, the accent chillingly familiar to Lucilla: \"I, too, have children!\"\\n\\n Lucilla controlled herself with an effort.\\n\\n When they were clear of the market street, she whispered to Burzmali: \"That man in the heavy coat back there - a Tleilaxu Master!\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t be,\" Burzmali protested. \"Too tall.\"\\n\\n \"Two of them, one on the shoulders of the other.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen others like that since we arrived, but I didn\u0027t suspect.\"\\n\\n \"Many searchers are in these streets,\" she said.\\n\\n Lucilla found that she did not much care for the everyday life of the gutter inhabitants on this gutter planet. She no longer trusted the explanation for bringing the ghola here. Of all those planets on which the precious ghola could have been raised, why had the Sisterhood chosen this one? Or was the ghola truly precious? Could it be that he was merely bait?\\n\\n Almost blocking the narrow mouth of an alley beside them was a man plying a tall device of whirling lights.\\n\\n \"Live!\" he shouted. \"Live!\"\\n\\n Lucilla slowed her pace to watch a passerby step into the alleyway and pass a coin to the proprietor, then lean into a concave basin made brilliant by the lights. The proprietor stared back at Lucilla. She saw a man with a narrow dark face, the face of a Caladanian primitive on a body only slightly taller than that of a Tleilaxu Master. There had been a look of contempt on his brooding face as he took the customer\u0027s money.\\n\\n The customer lifted his face from the basin with a shudder and then left the alley, staggering slightly, his eyes glazed.\\n\\n Lucilla recognized the device. Users called it a hypnobong and it was outlawed on all of the more civilized worlds.\\n\\n Burzmali hurried her out of the view of the brooding hypnobong proprietor.\\n\\n They came to a wider side street with a corner doorway set into the building across from them. Foot traffic all around; not a vehicle in sight. A tall man sat on the first step in the corner doorway, his knees drawn up close to his chin. His long arms were wrapped around his knees, the thin-fingered hands clasped tightly together. He wore a wide-brimmed black hat that shaded his face from the streetlights, but twin gleams from the shadows under that brim told Lucilla that this was no kind of human she had ever before encountered. This was something about which the Bene Gesserit had only speculated.\\n\\n Burzmali waited until they were well away from the seated figure before satisfying her curiosity.\\n\\n \"Futar,\" he whispered. \"That\u0027s what they call themselves. They\u0027ve only recently been seen here on Gammu.\"\\n\\n \"A Tleilaxu experiment,\" Lucilla guessed. And she thought: a mistake that has returned from the Scattering. \"What are they doing here?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Trading colony, so the natives here tell us.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you believe it. Those are hunting animals that have been crossed with humans.\"\\n\\n \"Ahhh, here we are,\" Burzmali said.\\n\\n He guided Lucilla through a narrow doorway into a dimly lighted eating establishment. This was part of their disguise, Lucilla knew: Do what others in this quarter did, but she did not relish eating in this place, not with what she could interpret from the smells.\\n\\n The place had been crowded but it was emptying as they entered.\\n\\n \"This commerciel was recommended highly,\" Burzmali said as they seated themselves in a mechaslot and waited for the menu to be projected.\\n\\n Lucilla watched the departing customers. Night workers from nearby factories and offices, she guessed. They appeared anxious in their hurry, perhaps fearful of what might be done to them if they were tardy.\\n\\n How insulated she had been at the Keep, she thought. She did not like what she was learning of Gammu. What a scruffy place this commerciel was! The stools at the counter to her right had been scarred and chipped. The tabletop in front of her had been scored and rubbed with gritty cleaners until it no longer could be kept clean by the vacusweep whose nozzle she could see near her left elbow. There was no sign of even the cheapest sonic to maintain cleanliness. Food and other evidence of deterioration had accumulated in the table\u0027s scratches. Lucilla shuddered. She could not avoid the feeling that it had been a mistake to separate from the ghola.\\n\\n The menu had been projected, she saw, and Burzmali already was scanning it.\\n\\n \"I will order for you,\" he said.\\n\\n Burzmali\u0027s way of saying he did not want her to make a mistake by ordering something a woman of the Hormu might avoid.\\n\\n It galled her to feel dependent. She was a Reverend Mother! She was trained to take command in any situation, mistress of her own destiny. How tiring all of this was. She gestured at the dirty window on her left where people could be seen passing on the narrow street.\\n\\n \"I am losing business while we dally, Skar.\"\\n\\n There! That was in character.\\n\\n Burzmali almost sighed. At last! he thought. She had begun to function once more as a Reverend Mother. He could not understand her abstracted attitude, the way she looked at the city and its people.\\n\\n Two milky drinks slid from the slot onto the table. Burzmali drank his in one swallow. Lucilla tested her drink on the tip of her tongue, sorting the contents. An imitation caffiate diluted with a nut-flavored juice.\\n\\n Burzmali gestured upward with his chin for her to drink it quickly. She obeyed, concealing a grimace at the chemical flavors. Burzmali\u0027s attention was on something over her right shoulder but she dared not turn. That would be out of character.\\n\\n \"Come.\" He placed a coin on the table and hurried her out into the street. He smiled the smile of an eager customer but there was wariness in his eyes.\\n\\n The tempo of the streets had changed. There were fewer people. The shadowy doors conveyed a deeper sense of menace. Lucilla reminded herself that she was supposed to represent a powerful guild whose members were immune to the common violence of the gutter. The few people on the street did make way for her, eyeing the dragons of her robe with every appearance of awe.\\n\\n Burzmali stopped at a doorway.\\n\\n It was like the others along this street, set back slightly from the walkway, so tall that it appeared narrower than it actually was. An old-fashioned security beam guarded the entrance. None of the newer systems had penetrated to the slum, apparently. The streets themselves were testimony to that: designed for groundcars. She doubted that there was a roofpad in the entire area. No sign of flitters or,\u0027thopters could be heard or seen. There was music, though - a faint susurration reminiscent of semuta. Something new in semuta addiction? This would certainly be an area where addicts would go to ground.\\n\\n Lucilla looked up at the face of the building as Burzmali moved ahead of her and made their presence known by breaking the doorway beam.\\n\\n There were no windows in the building\u0027s face. Only the faint glitterings of surface \u0027eyes here and there in the dull sheen of ancient plasteel. They were old-fashioned comeyes, she noted, much bigger than modern ones.\\n\\n A door deep in the shadows swung inward on silent hinges.\\n\\n \"This way.\" Burzmali reached back and urged her forward with a hand on her elbow.\\n\\n They entered a dimly lighted hallway that smelled of exotic foods and bitter essences. She was a moment identifying some of the things that assailed her nostrils. Melange. She caught the unmistakable cinnamon ripeness. And yes, semuta. She identified burned rice, higet salts. Someone was masking another kind of cooking. There were explosives being made here. She thought of warning Burzmali but reconsidered. It was not necessary for him to know and there might be ears in this confined space to hear whatever she said.\\n\\n Burzmali led the way up a shadowy flight of stairs with a dim glowstrip along the slanting baseboard. At the top he found a hidden switch concealed behind a patch in the patched and repatched wall. There was no sound when he pushed the switch but Lucilla felt a change in the movement all around them. Silence. It was a new kind of silence in her experience, a crouching preparation for flight or violence.\\n\\n It was cold in the stairwell and she shivered, but not from the chill. Footsteps sounded beyond the doorway beside the patch-masked switch.\\n\\n A gray-haired hag in a yellow smock opened the door and peered up at them past her straggling eyebrows.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s you,\" she said, her voice wavering. She stood aside for them to enter.\\n\\n Lucilla glanced swiftly around the room as she heard the door close behind them. It was a room the unobservant might think shabby, but that was superficial. Underneath, it was quality. The shabbiness was another mask, partly a matter of this place having been fitted to a particularly demanding person: This goes here and nowhere else! That goes over there and it stays there! The furnishings and bric-a-brac looked a little worn but someone here did not object to that. The room felt better this way. It was that kind of room.\\n\\n Who possessed this room? The old woman? She was making her painful way toward a door on their left.\\n\\n \"We are not to be disturbed until dawn,\" Burzmali said.\\n\\n The old woman stopped and turned.\\n\\n Lucilla studied her. Was this another who shammed advanced age? No. The age was real. Every motion was diffused by unsteadiness - a trembling of the neck, a failure of the body that betrayed her in ways she could not prevent.\\n\\n \"Even if it\u0027s somebody important?\" the old woman asked in her wavering voice.\\n\\n The eyes twitched when she spoke. Her mouth moved only minimally to emit the necessary sounds, spacing out her words as though she drew them from somewhere deep within. Her shoulders, curved from years of bending at some fixed work, would not straighten enough for her to look Burzmali in the eyes. She peered upward past her brows instead, an oddly furtive posture.\\n\\n \"What important person are you expecting?\" Burzmali asked.\\n\\n The old woman shuddered and appeared to take a long time understanding.\\n\\n \"Impor-r-rtant people come here,\" she said.\\n\\n Lucilla recognized the body signals and blurted it because Burzmali must know:\\n\\n \"She\u0027s from Rakis!\"\\n\\n The old woman\u0027s curious upward gaze locked on Lucilla. The ancient voice said: \"I was a priestess, Hormu Lady.\"\\n\\n \"Of course she\u0027s from Rakis,\" Burzmali said. His tone warned her not to question.\\n\\n \"I would not harm you,\" the hag whined.\\n\\n \"Do you still serve the Divided God?\"\\n\\n Again, there was that long delay for the old woman to respond.\\n\\n \"Many serve the Great Guldur,\" she said.\\n\\n Lucilla pursed her lips and once more scanned the room. The old woman had been reduced greatly in importance. \"I am glad I do not have to kill you,\" Lucilla said.\\n\\n The old woman\u0027s jaw drooped open in a parody of surprise while spittle dripped from her lips.\\n\\n This was a descendant of Fremen? Lucilla let her revulsion come out in a long shudder. This mendicant bit of flotsam had been shaped from a people who walked tall and proud, a people who died bravely. This one would die whining.\\n\\n \"Please trust me,\" the hag whined and fled the room.\\n\\n \"Why did you do that?\" Burzmali demanded. \"These are the ones who will get us to Rakis!\"\\n\\n She merely looked at him, recognizing the fear in his question. It was fear for her.\\n\\n But I did not imprint him back there, she thought.\\n\\n With a sense of shock she realized that Burzmali had recognized hate in her. I hate them! she thought. I hate the people of this planet!\\n\\n That was a dangerous emotion for a Reverend Mother. Still it burned in her. This planet had changed her in a way she did not want. She did not want the realization that such things could be. Intellectual understanding was one thing; experience was another.\\n\\n Damn them!\\n\\n But they already were damned.\\n\\n Her chest pained her. Frustration! There was no escaping this new awareness. What had happened to these people?\\n\\n People?\\n\\n The shells were here but they no longer could be called fully alive. Dangerous, though. Supremely dangerous.\\n\\n \"We must rest while we can,\" Burzmali said.\\n\\n \"I do not have to earn my money?\" she demanded.\\n\\n Burzmali paled. \"What we did was necessary! We were lucky and were not stopped but it could have happened!\"\\n\\n \"And this place is safe?\"\\n\\n \"As safe as I can make it. Everyone here has been screened by me or by my people.\"\\n\\n Lucilla found a long couch that smelled of old perfumes and composed herself there to scour her emotions of the dangerous hate. Where hate entered, love might follow! She heard Burzmali stretching out to rest on cushions against a nearby wall. Soon, he was breathing deeply, but sleep evaded Lucilla. She kept sensing crowds of memories, things thrust forward by the Others who shared her inner storerooms of thinking. Abruptly, inner vision gave her a glimpse of a street and faces, people moving in bright sunlight. It took a moment for her to realize that she saw all of this from a peculiar angle - that she was being cradled in someone\u0027s arms. She knew then that this was one of her own personal memories. She could place the one who held her, feel the warm heartbeat next to a warm cheek.\\n\\n Lucilla tasted the salt of her own tears.\\n\\n She realized then that Gammu had touched her more deeply than any experience since her first days in the Bene Gesserit schools.\\n\\n Concealed behind strong barriers the heart becomes ice.\\n\\n - Darwi Odrade, Argument in Council\\n\\n It was a group filled with fierce tensions: Taraza (wearing secret mail under her robe and mindful of the other precautions she had taken), Odrade (certain that there could be violence and consequently wary), Sheeana (thoroughly briefed on the probabilities here and shielded behind three Security Mothers who moved with her like fleshly armor), Waff (worried that his reason might have been clouded by some mysterious Bene Gesserit artifice), the false Tuek (giving every evidence that he was about to erupt in rage), and nine of Tuek\u0027s Rakian counselors (each angrily engaged in seeking ascendancy for self or family).\\n\\n In addition, five guardian acolytes, bred and trained by the Sisterhood for physical violence, stayed close to Taraza. Waff moved with an equal number of new Face Dancers.\\n\\n They had convened in the penthouse atop the Dar-es-Balat Museum. It was a long room with a wall of plaz facing west across a roof garden of lacy greenery. The interior was furnished with soft divans and was decorated with artful displays from the Tyrant\u0027s no-room.\\n\\n Odrade had argued against including Sheeana but Taraza remained adamant. The girl\u0027s effect on Waff and some of the priesthood represented an overwhelming advantage for the Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n There were dolban screens over the long wall of windows to keep out the worst glare of a westering sun. That the room faced west said something to Odrade. The windows looked into the land of gloaming where Shai-hulud took his repose. It was a room focused on the past, on death. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-26.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) \\n With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
