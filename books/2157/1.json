How? traps you in a universe of cause and effect. Both deny the infinite.\\n\\n - The Apocrypha of Arrakis\\n\\n \"Taraza told you, did she not, that we have gone through eleven of these Duncan Idaho gholas? This one is the twelfth.\"\\n\\n The old Reverend Mother Schwangyu spoke with deliberate bitterness as she looked down from the third-story parapet at the lone child playing on the enclosed lawn. The planet Gammu\u0027s bright midday sunlight bounced off the white courtyard walls filling the area beneath them with brilliance as though a spotlight had been directed onto the young ghola.\\n\\n Gone through! the Reverend Mother Lucilla thought. She allowed herself a short nod, thinking how coldly impersonal were Schwangyu\u0027s manner and choice of words. We have used up our supply; send us more!\\n\\n The child on the lawn appeared to be about twelve standard years of age, but appearance could be deceptive with a ghola not yet awakened to his original memories. The child took that moment to look up at the watchers above him. He was a sturdy figure with a direct gaze that focused intently from beneath a black cap of karakul hair. The yellow sunlight of early spring cast a small shadow at his feet. His skin was darkly tanned but a slight movement of his body shifted his blue singlesuit, revealing pale skin at the left shoulder.\\n\\n \"Not only are these gholas costly but they are supremely dangerous to us,\" Schwangyu said. Her voice came out flat and emotionless, all the more powerful because of that. It was the voice of a Reverend Mother Instructor speaking down to an acolyte and it emphasized for Lucilla that Schwangyu was one of those who protested openly against the ghola project.\\n\\n Taraza had warned: \"She will try to win you over.\"\\n\\n \"Eleven failures are enough,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n Lucilla glanced at Schwangyu\u0027s wrinkled features, thinking suddenly: Someday I may be old and wizened, too. And perhaps I will be a power in the Bene Gesserit as well.\\n\\n Schwangyu was a small woman with many age marks earned in the Sisterhood\u0027s affairs. Lucilla knew from her own assignment-studies that Schwangyu\u0027s conventional black robe concealed a skinny figure that few other than her acolyte dressers and the males bred to her had ever seen. Schwangyu\u0027s mouth was wide, the lower lip constricted by the age lines that fanned into a jutting chin. Her manner tended to a curt abruptness that the uninitiated often interpreted as anger. The commander of the Gammu Keep was one who kept herself to herself more than most Reverend Mothers.\\n\\n Once more, Lucilla wished she knew the entire scope of the ghola project. Taraza had drawn the dividing line clearly enough, though: \"Schwangyu is not to be trusted where the safety of the ghola is concerned.\"\\n\\n \"We think the Tleilaxu themselves killed most of the previous eleven,\" Schwangyu said. \"That in itself should tell us something.\"\\n\\n Matching Schwangyu\u0027s manner, Lucilla adopted a quiet attitude of almost emotionless waiting. Her manner said: \"I may be much younger than you, Schwangyu, but I, too, am a full Reverend Mother.\" She could feel Schwangyu\u0027s gaze.\\n\\n Schwangyu had seen the holos of this Lucilla but the woman in the flesh was more disconcerting. An Imprinter of the best training, no doubt of it. Blue-in-blue eyes uncorrected by any lens gave Lucilla a piercing expression that went with her long oval face. With the hood of her black aba robe thrown back as it was now, brown hair was revealed, drawn into a tight barette and then cascading down her back. Not even the stiffest robe could completely hide Lucilla\u0027s ample breasts. She was from a genetic line famous for its motherly nature and she already had borne three children for the Sisterhood, two by the same sire. Yes - a brown-haired charmer with full breasts and a motherly disposition.\\n\\n \"You say very little,\" Schwangyu said. \"This tells me that Taraza has warned you against me.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have reason to believe assassins will try to kill this twelfth ghola?\" Lucilla asked.\\n\\n \"They already have tried.\"\\n\\n Strange how the word \"heresy\" came to mind when thinking of Schwangyu, Lucilla thought. Could there be heresy among the Reverend Mothers? The religious overtones of the word seemed out of place in a Bene Gesserit context. How could there be heretical movements among people who held a profoundly manipulative attitude toward all things religious?\\n\\n Lucilla shifted her attention down to the ghola, who took this moment to perform a series of cartwheels that brought him around full circle until he once more stood looking up at the two observers on the parapet.\\n\\n \"How prettily he performs!\" Schwangyu sneered. The old voice did not completely mask an underlying violence.\\n\\n Lucilla glanced at Schwangyu. Heresy. Dissidence was not the proper word. Opposition did not cover what could be sensed in the older woman. This was something that could shatter the Bene Gesserit. Revolt against Taraza, against the Reverend Mother Superior? Unthinkable! Mother Superiors were cast in the mold of monarch. Once Taraza had accepted counsel and advice and then made her decision, the Sisters were committed to obedience.\\n\\n \"This is no time to be creating new problems!\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n Her meaning was clear. People from the Scattering were coming back and the intent of some among those Lost Ones threatened the Sisterhood. Honored Matres! How like \"Reverend Mothers\" the words sounded.\\n\\n Lucilla ventured an exploratory sally: \"So you think we should be concentrating on the problem of those Honored Matres from the Scattering?\"\\n\\n \"Concentrating? Hah! They do not have our powers. They do not show good sense. And they do not have mastery of melange! That is what they want from us, our spice knowledge.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" Lucilla agreed. She was not willing to concede this on the scanty evidence.\\n\\n \"Mother Superior Taraza has taken leave of her senses to dally with this ghola thing now,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n Lucilla remained silent. The ghola project definitely had touched an old nerve among the Sisters. The possibility, even remote, that they might arouse another Kwisatz Haderach sent shudders of angry fear through the ranks. To meddle with the worm-bound remnants of the Tyrant! That was dangerous in the extreme.\\n\\n \"We should never take that ghola to Rakis,\" Schwangyu muttered. \"Let sleeping worms lie.\"\\n\\n Lucilla gave her attention once more to the ghola-child. He had turned his back on the high parapet with its two Reverend Mothers, but something about his posture said he knew they discussed him and he awaited their response.\\n\\n \"You doubtless realize that you have been called in while he is yet too young,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n \"I have never heard of the deep imprinting on one that young,\" Lucilla agreed. She allowed something softly self-mocking in her tone, a thing she knew Schwangyu would hear and misinterpret. The management of procreation and all of its attendant necessities, that was the Bene Gesserit ultimate specialty. Use love but avoid it, Schwangyu would be thinking now. The Sisterhood\u0027s analysts knew the roots of love. They had examined this quite early in their development but had never dared breed it out of those they influenced. Tolerate love but guard against it, that was the rule. Know that it lay deep within the human genetic makeup, a safety net to insure continuation of the species. You used it where necessary, imprinting selected individuals (sometimes upon each other) for the Sisterhood\u0027s purposes, knowing then that such individuals would be linked by powerful bonding lines not readily available to the common awareness. Others might observe such links and plot the consequences but the linked ones would dance to unconscious music.\\n\\n \"I was not suggesting that it\u0027s a mistake to imprint him,\" Schwangyu said, misreading Lucilla\u0027s silence.\\n\\n \"We do what we are ordered to do,\" Lucilla chided. Let Schwangyu make of that what she would.\\n\\n \"Then you do not object to taking the ghola to Rakis,\" Schwangyu said. \"I wonder if you would continue such unquestioning obedience if you knew the full story?\"\\n\\n Lucilla inhaled a deep breath. Was the entire design for the Duncan Idaho gholas to be shared with her now?\\n\\n \"There is a female child named Sheeana Brugh on Rakis,\" Schwangyu said. \"She can control the giant worms.\"\\n\\n Lucilla concealed her alertness. Giant worms. Not Shai-hulud. Not Shaitan. Giant worms. The sandrider predicted by the Tyrant had appeared at last!\\n\\n \"I do not make idle chatter,\" Schwangyu said when Lucilla continued silent.\\n\\n Indeed not, Lucilla thought. And you call a thing by its descriptive label, not by the name of its mystical import. Giant worms. And you\u0027re really thinking about the Tyrant, Leto II, whose endless dream is carried as a pearl of awareness in each of those worms. Or so we are led to believe.\\n\\n Schwangyu nodded toward the child on the lawn below them. \"Do you think their ghola will be able to influence the girl who controls the worms?\"\\n\\n We\u0027re peeling away the skin at last, Lucilla thought. She said: \"I have no need for the answer to such a question.\"\\n\\n \"You are a cautious one,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n Lucilla arched her back and stretched. Cautious? Yes, indeed! Taraza had warned her: \"Where Schwangyu is concerned, you must act with extreme caution but with speed. We have a very narrow window of time within which we can succeed.\"\\n\\n Succeed at what? Lucilla wondered. She glanced sideways at Schwangyu. \"I don\u0027t see how the Tleilaxu could succeed in killing eleven of these gholas. How could they get through our defenses?\"\\n\\n \"We have the Bashar now,\" Schwangyu said. \"Perhaps he can prevent disaster.\" Her tone said she did not believe this.\\n\\n Mother Superior Taraza had said: \"You are the Imprinter, Lucilla. When you get to Gammu you will recognize some of the pattern. But for your task you have no need for the full design.\"\\n\\n \"Think of the cost!\" Schwangyu said, glaring down at the ghola, who now squatted, pulling at tufts of grass.\\n\\n Cost had nothing to do with it, Lucilla knew. The open admission of failure was much more important. The Sisterhood could not reveal its fallibility. But the fact that an Imprinter had been summoned early - that was vital. Taraza had known the Imprinter would see this and recognize part of the pattern.\\n\\n Schwangyu gestured with one bony hand at the child, who had returned to his solitary play, running and tumbling on the grass.\\n\\n \"Politics,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n No doubt Sisterhood politics lay at the core of Schwangyu\u0027s heresy, Lucilla thought. The delicacy of the internal argument could be deduced from the fact that Schwangyu had been put in charge of the Keep here on Gammu. Those who opposed Taraza refused to sit on the sidelines.\\n\\n Schwangyu turned and looked squarely at Lucilla. Enough had been said. Enough had been heard and screened through minds trained in Bene Gesserit awareness. The Chapter House had chosen this Lucilla with great care.\\n\\n Lucilla felt the older woman\u0027s careful examination but refused to let this touch that innermost sense of purpose upon which every Reverend Mother could rely in times of stress. Here. Get her look fully upon me. Lucilla turned and set her mouth in a soft smile, passing her gaze across the rooftop opposite them.\\n\\n A uniformed man armed with a heavy-duty lasgun appeared there, looked once at the two Reverend Mothers and then focused on the child below them.\\n\\n \"Who is that?\" Lucilla asked \"Patrin, the Bashar\u0027s most trusted aide. Says he\u0027s only the Bashar\u0027s batman but you\u0027d have to be blind and a fool to believe that. \"\\n\\n Lucilla examined the man across from them with care. So that was Patrin. A native of Gammu, Taraza had said. Chosen for this task by the Bashar himself. Thin and blond, much too old now to be soldiering, but then the Bashar had been called back from retirement and had insisted Patrin must share this duty.\\n\\n Schwangyu noted the way Lucilla shifted her attention from Patrin to the ghola with real concern. Yes, if the Bashar had been called back to guard this Keep, then the ghola was in extreme peril.\\n\\n Lucilla started in sudden surprise. \"Why... he\u0027s...\"\\n\\n \"Miles Teg\u0027s orders,\" Schwangyu said, naming the Bashar. \"All of the ghola\u0027s play is training play. Muscles are to be prepared for the day when he is restored to his original self.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s no simple exercise he\u0027s doing down there,\" Lucilla said. She felt her own muscles respond sympathetically to the remembered training.\\n\\n \"We hold back only the Sisterhood\u0027s arcana from this ghola,\" Schwangyu said. \"Almost anything else in our storehouse of knowledge can be his.\" Her tone said she found this extremely objectionable.\\n\\n \"Surely, no one believes this ghola could become another Kwisatz Haderach,\" Lucilla objected.\\n\\n Schwangyu merely shrugged.\\n\\n Lucilla held herself quite still, thinking. Was it possible the ghola could be transformed into a male version of a Reverend Mother? Could this Duncan Idaho learn to look inward where no Reverend Mother dared?\\n\\n Schwangyu began to speak, her voice almost a growling mutter: \"The design of this project... they have a dangerous plan. They could make the same mistake...\" She broke off.\\n\\n They, Lucilla thought. Their ghola.\\n\\n \"I would give anything to know for sure the position of Ix and the Fish Speakers in this,\" Lucilla said.\\n\\n \"Fish Speakers!\" Schwangyu shook her head at the very thought of the remnant female army that had once served only the Tyrant. \"They believe in truth and justice.\"\\n\\n Lucilla overcame a sudden tightness in her throat. Schwangyu had all but declared open opposition. Yet, she commanded here. The political rule was a simple one: Those who opposed the project must monitor it that they might abort it at the first sign of trouble. But that was a genuine Duncan Idaho ghola down there on the lawn. Cell comparisons and Truthsayers had confirmed it.\\n\\n Taraza had said: \"You are to teach him love in all of its forms.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s so young,\" Lucilla said, keeping her attention on the ghola.\\n\\n \"Young, yes,\" Schwangyu said. \"So, for now, I presume you will awaken his childish responses to maternal affection. Later...\" Schwangyu shrugged.\\n\\n Lucilla betrayed no emotional reaction. A Bene Gesserit obeyed. I am an Imprinter. So... Taraza\u0027s orders and the Imprinter\u0027s specialized training defined a particular course of events.\\n\\n To Schwangyu, Lucilla said: \"There is someone who looks like me and speaks with my voice. I am Imprinting for her. May I ask who that is?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Lucilla held her silence. She had not expected revelation but it had been remarked more than once that she bore a striking resemblance to Senior Security Mother Darwi Odrade. \"A young Odrade.\" Lucilla had heard this on several occasions. Both Lucilla and Odrade were, of course, in the Atreides line with a strong backbreeding from Siona descendants. The Fish Speakers had no monopoly on those genes! But the Other Memories of a Reverend Mother, even with their linear selectivity and confinement to the female side, provided important clues to the broad shape of the ghola project. Lucilla, who had come to depend on her experiences of the Jessica persona buried some five thousand years back in the Sisterhood\u0027s genetic manipulations, felt a deep sense of dread from that source now. There was a familiar pattern here. It gave off such an intense feeling of doom that Lucilla fell automatically into the Litany Against Fear as she had been taught it in her first introduction to the Sisterhood\u0027s rites:\\n\\n \"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\"\\n\\n Calm returned to Lucilla.\\n\\n Schwangyu, sensing some of this, allowed her guard to drop slightly. Lucilla was no dullard, no special Reverend Mother with an empty title and barely sufficient background to function without embarrassing the Sisterhood. Lucilla was the real thing and some reactions could not be hidden from her, not even reactions of another Reverend Mother. Very well, let her know the full extent of the opposition to this foolish, this dangerous project!\\n\\n \"I do not think their ghola will survive to see Rakis,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n Lucilla let this pass. \"Tell me about his friends,\" she said.\\n\\n \"He has no friends; only teachers.\"\\n\\n \"When will I meet them?\" She kept her gaze on the opposite parapet where Patrin leaned idly-against a low pillar, his heavy lasgun at the ready. Lucilla realized with an abrupt shock that Patrin was watching her. Patrin was a message from the Bashar! Schwangyu obviously saw and understood. We guard him!\\n\\n \"I presume it\u0027s Miles Teg you\u0027re so anxious to meet,\" Schwangyu said.\\n\\n \"Among others.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you want to make contact with the ghola first?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve already made contact with him.\" Lucilla nodded toward the enclosed yard where the child once more stood almost motionless and looking up at her. \"He\u0027s a thoughtful one.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve only the reports on the others,\" Schwangyu said, \"but I suspect this is the most thoughtful one of the series.\"\\n\\n Lucilla suppressed an involuntary shudder at the readiness for violent opposition in Schwangyu\u0027s words and attitude. There was not one hint that the child below them shared a common humanity.\\n\\n While Lucilla was thinking this, clouds covered the sun as they often did here at this hour. A cold wind blew in over the Keep\u0027s walls, swirling around the courtyard. The child turned away and picked up the speed of his exercises, getting his warmth from increased activity.\\n\\n \"Where does he go to be alone?\" Lucilla asked.\\n\\n \"Mostly to his room. He has tried a few dangerous escapades, but we have discouraged this.\"\\n\\n \"He must hate us very much.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure of it.\"\\n\\n \"I will have to deal with that directly.\"\\n\\n \"Surely, an Imprinter has no doubts about her ability to overcome hate.\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking of Geasa.\" Lucilla sent a knowing look at Schwangyu. \"I find it astonishing that you let Geasa make such a mistake.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t interfere with the normal progress of the ghola\u0027s instructions. If one of his teachers develops a real affection for him, that is not my problem.\"\\n\\n \"An attractive child,\" Lucilla said.\\n\\n They stood a bit longer watching the Duncan Idaho ghola at his training-play. Both Reverend Mothers thought briefly of Geasa, one of the first teachers brought here for the ghola project. Schwangyu\u0027s attitude was plain: Geasa was a providential failure. Lucilla thought only: Schwangyu and Geasa complicated my task. Neither woman gave even a passing moment to the way these thoughts reaffirmed their loyalties.\\n\\n As she watched the child in the courtyard, Lucilla began to have a new appreciation of what the Tyrant God Emperor had actually achieved. Leto II had employed this ghola-type through uncounted lifetimes - some thirty-five hundred years of them, one after another. And the God Emperor Leto II had been no ordinary force of nature. He had been the biggest juggernaut in human history, rolling over everything: over social systems, over natural and unnatural hatreds, over governmental forms, over rituals (both taboo and mandatory), over religions casual and religions intense. The crushing weight of the Tyrant\u0027s passage had left nothing unmarked, not even the Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n Leto II had called it \"The Golden Path\" and this Duncan Idaho-type ghola below her now had figured prominently in that awesome passage. Lucilla had studied the Bene Gesserit accounts, probably the best in the universe. Even today on most of the old Imperial Planets, newly married couples still scattered dollops of water east and west, mouthing the local version of \"Let Thy blessings flow back to us from this offering, O God of Infinite Power and Infinite Mercy.\"\\n\\n Once, it had been the task of Fish Speakers and their tame priesthood to enforce such obeisance. But the thing had developed its own momentum, becoming a pervasive compulsion. Even the most doubting of believers said: \"Well, it can do no harm.\" It was an accomplishment that the finest religious engineers of the Bene Gesserit Missionaria Protectiva admired with frustrated awe. The Tyrant had surpassed the Bene Gesserit best. And fifteen hundred years since the Tyrant\u0027s death, the Sisterhood remained powerless to unlock the central knot of that fearsome accomplishment.\\n\\n \"Who has charge of the child\u0027s religious training?\" Lucilla asked.\\n\\n \"No one,\" Schwangyu said. \"Why bother? If he is reawakened to his original memories, he will have his own ideas. We will deal with those if we ever have to.\"\\n\\n The child below them completed his allotted training time. Without another look up at the watchers on the parapet, he left the enclosed yard and entered a wide doorway on the left. Patrin, too, abandoned his guard position without glancing at the two Reverend Mothers.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be fooled by Teg\u0027s people,\" Schwangyu said. \"They have eyes in the backs of their heads. Teg\u0027s birth-mother, you know, was one of us. He is teaching that ghola things better never shared!\"\\n\\n Explosions are also compressions of time. Observable changes in the natural universe all are explosive to some degree and from some point of view; otherwise you would not notice them. Smooth Continuity of change, if slowed sufficiently, goes without notice by observers whose time/attention span is too short. Thus, I tell you, I have seen changes you would never have marked.\\n\\n - Leto II\\n\\n The woman standing in Chapter House Planet\u0027s morning light across the table from the Reverend Mother Superior Alma Mavis Taraza was tall and supple. The long aba robe that encased her in shimmering black from shoulders to floor did not completely conceal the grace with which her body expressed every movement.\\n\\n Taraza leaned forward in her chairdog and scanned the Records Relay projecting its condensed Bene Gesserit glyphs above the tabletop for her eyes only.\\n\\n \"Darwi Odrade,\" the display identified the standing woman, and then came the essential biography, which Taraza already knew in detail. The display served several purposes - it provided a secure reminder for the Mother Superior, it allowed an occasional delay for thought while she appeared to scan the records, and it was a final argument should something negative arise from this interview.\\n\\n Odrade had borne nineteen children for the Bene Gesserit, Taraza observed as the information scrolled past her eyes. Each child by a different father. Not much unusual about that, but even the most searching gaze could see that this essential service to the Sisterhood had not grossened Odrade\u0027s flesh. Her features conveyed a natural hauteur in the long nose and the complementary angular cheeks. Every feature focused downward to a narrow chin: Her mouth, though, was full and promised a passion that she was careful to bridle.\\n\\n We can always depend on the Atreides genes, Taraza thought. A window curtain fluttered behind Odrade and she glanced back at it. They were in Taraza\u0027s morning room, a small and elegantly furnished space decorated in shades of green. Only the stark white of Taraza\u0027s chairdog separated her from the background. The room\u0027s bow windows looked eastward onto garden and lawn with faraway snowy mountains of Chapter House Planet as backdrop.\\n\\n Without looking up, Taraza said: \"I was glad when both you and Lucilla accepted the assignment. It makes my task much easier.\"\\n\\n \"I would like to have met this Lucilla,\" Odrade said, looking down at the top of Taraza\u0027s head. Odrade\u0027s voice came out a soft contralto.\\n\\n Taraza cleared her throat. \"No need. Lucilla is one of our finest Imprinters. Each of you, of course, received the identical liberal conditioning to prepare you for this.\"\\n\\n There was something almost insulting in Taraza\u0027s casual tone and only the habits of long association put down Odrade\u0027s immediate resentment. It was partly that word \"liberal,\" she realized. Atreides ancestors rose up in rebellion at the word. It was as though her accumulated female memories lashed out at the unconscious assumptions and unexamined prejudices behind the concept.\\n\\n \"Only liberals really think. Only liberals are intellectual. Only liberals understand the needs of their fellows.\"\\n\\n How much viciousness lay concealed in that word! Odrade thought. How much secret ego demanding to feel superior.\\n\\n Odrade reminded herself that Taraza, despite the casually insulting tone, had used the term only in its catholic sense: Lucilla\u0027s generalized education had been carefully matched to that of Odrade.\\n\\n Taraza leaned back into a more comfortable position but still kept her attention on the display in front of her. The light from the eastern windows fell directly on her face, leaving shadows beneath nose and chin. A small woman just a bit older than Odrade, Taraza retained much of the beauty that had made her a most reliable breeder with difficult sires. Her face was a long oval with soft curved cheeks. She wore her black hair drawn back tightly from a high forehead with a pronounced peak. Taraza\u0027s mouth opened minimally when she spoke: superb control of movement. An observer\u0027s attention tended to focus on her eyes: that compelling blue-in-blue. The total effect was of a suave facial mask from which little escaped to betray her true emotions.\\n\\n Odrade recognized this present pose in the Mother Superior. Taraza would mutter to herself presently. Indeed, right on cue, Taraza muttered to herself.\\n\\n The Mother Superior was thinking while she followed the biographical display with great attention. Many matters occupied her attention.\\n\\n This was a reassuring thought to Odrade. Taraza did not believe there was any such thing as a beneficent power guarding humankind. The Missionaria Protectiva and the intentions of the Sisterhood counted for everything in Taraza\u0027s universe. Whatever served those intentions, even the machinations of the long-dead Tyrant, could be judged good. All else was evil. Alien intrusions from the Scattering - especially those returning descendants who called themselves \"Honored Matres\" - were not to be trusted. Taraza\u0027s own people, even those Reverend Mothers who opposed her in Council, were the ultimate Bene Gesserit resource, the only thing that could be trusted.\\n\\n Still without looking up, Taraza said: \"Do you know that when you compare the millennia preceding the Tyrant with those after his death, the decrease in major conflicts is phenomenal. Since the Tyrant, the number of such conflicts has dropped to less than two percent of what it was before.\"\\n\\n \"As far as we know,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n Taraza\u0027s gaze flicked upward and then down. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"We have no way of telling how many wars have been fought outside our ken. Have you statistics from the people of the Scattering?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not!\" ` \"Leto tamed us is what you\u0027re saying,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n \"If you care to put it that way.\" Taraza inserted a marker in something she saw on her display.\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t some of the credit go to our beloved Bashar Miles Teg?\" Odrade asked. \"Or to his talented predecessors?\"\\n\\n \"We chose those people,\" Taraza said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see the pertinence of this martial discussion,\" Odrade said. \"What does it have to do with our present problem?\"\\n\\n \"There are some who think we may revert to the pre-Tyrant condition with a very nasty bang.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Odrade pursed her lips.\\n\\n \"Several groups among our returning Lost Ones are selling arms to anyone who wants to or can buy.\"\\n\\n \"Specifics?\" Odrade asked.\\n\\n \"Sophisticated arms are flooding onto Gammu and there can be little doubt the Tleilaxu are stockpiling some of the nastier weapons.\"\\n\\n Taraza leaned back and rubbed her temples. She spoke in a low, almost musing voice. \"We think we make decisions of the greatest moment and out of the very highest principles.\"\\n\\n Odrade had seen this before, too. She said: \"Does the Mother Superior doubt the rightness of the Bene Gesserit?\"\\n\\n \"Doubt? Oh, no. But I do experience frustration. We work all of our lives for these highly refined goals and in the end, what do we find? We find that many of the things to which we have dedicated our lives came from petty decisions. They can be traced to desires for personal comfort or convenience and had nothing at all to do with our high ideals. What really was at stake was some worldly working agreement that satisfied the needs of those who could make the decisions.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard you call that political necessity,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n Taraza spoke with tight control while returning her attention to the display in front of her. \"If we become institutionalized in our judgments, that\u0027s a sure way to extinguish the Bene Gesserit.\"\\n\\n \"You will not find petty decisions in my bio,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n \"I look for sources of weakness, for flaws.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t find those, either.\"\\n\\n Taraza concealed a smile. She recognized this egocentric remark: Odrade\u0027s way of needling the Mother Superior. Odrade was very good at seeming to be impatient while actually suspending herself in a timeless flow of patience.\\n\\n When Taraza did not rise to the bait, Odrade resumed her calm waiting - easy breaths, the mind steady. Patience came without thinking of it. The Sisterhood had taught her long ago how to divide past and present into simultaneous flowings. While observing her immediate surroundings, she could pick up bits and pieces of her past and live through them as though they moved across a screen superimposed over the present.\\n\\n Memory work, Odrade thought. Necessary things to haul out and lay to rest. Removing the barriers. When all else palled, there was still her tangled childhood.\\n\\n There had been a time when Odrade lived as most children lived: in a house with a man and woman who, if not her parents, certainly acted in loco parentis. All of the other children she knew then lived in similar situations. They had papas and mamas. Sometimes only papa worked away from home. Sometimes only mama went out to her labors. In Odrade\u0027s case, the woman remained at home and no creche nurse guarded the child in the working hours. Much later, Odrade learned that her birth-mother had given a large sum of money to provide this for the infant female hidden in plain sight that way.\\n\\n \"She hid you with us because she loved you,\" the woman explained when Odrade was old enough to understand. \"That is why you must never reveal that we are not your real parents.\"\\n\\n Love had nothing to do with it, Odrade learned later. Reverend Mothers did not act from such mundane motives. And Odrade\u0027s birth-mother had been a Bene Gesserit Sister.\\n\\n All of this was revealed to Odrade according to the original plan. Her name: Odrade. Darwi was what she had always been called when the caller was not being endearing or angry. Young friends naturally shortened it to Dar.\\n\\n Everything, however, did not go according to the original plan. Odrade recalled a narrow bed in a room brightened by paintings of animals and fantasy landscapes on the pastel blue walls. White curtains fluttered at the window in the soft breezes of spring and summer. Odrade remembered jumping on the narrow bed - a marvelously happy game: up, down, up, down. Much laughter. Arms caught her in mid leap and hugged her close. They were a man\u0027s arms: a round face with a small mustache that tickled her into giggles. The bed thumped the wall when she jumped and the wall revealed indentations from this movement.\\n\\n Odrade played over this memory now, reluctant to discard it into the well of rationality. Marks on a wall. Marks of laughter and joy. How small they were to represent so much.\\n\\n Odd how she had been thinking more and more about papa recently. All of the memories were not happy. There had been times when he had been sad-angry, warning mama not to become \"too involved.\" He had a face that reflected many frustrations. His voice barked when he was in his angry mood. Mama moved softly then, her eyes full of worry. Odrade sensed the worry and the fear and resented the man. The woman knew best how to deal with him. She kissed the nape of his neck, stroked his cheek and whispered into his ear.\\n\\n These ancient \"natural\" emotions had engaged a Bene Gesserit analyst-proctor in much work with Odrade before they were exorcised. But even now there was residual detritus to pick up and discard. Even now, Odrade knew that all of it was not gone.\\n\\n Seeing the way Taraza studied the biographical record with such care, Odrade wondered if that was the flaw the Mother Superior saw.\\n\\n Surely they know by now that I can deal with the emotions of those early times.\\n\\n It was all so long ago. Still, she had to admit that the memory of the man and woman lay within her, bonded with such force that it might never be erased completely. Especially mama.\\n\\n The Reverend Mother in extremis who had borne Odrade had put her in that hiding place on Gammu for reasons Odrade now understood quite well. Odrade harbored no resentments. It had been necessary for the survival of them both. Problems arose from the fact that the foster mother gave Odrade that thing which most mothers give their children, that thing which the Sisterhood so distrusted - love.\\n\\n When the Reverend Mothers came, the foster mother had not fought the removal of her child. Two Reverend Mothers came with a contingent of male and female proctors. Afterward Odrade was a long time understanding the significance of that wrenching moment. The woman had known in her heart that the day of parting would come. Only a matter of time. Still, as the days became years - almost six standards of years - the woman had dared to hope.\\n\\n Then the Reverend Mothers came with their burly attendants. They had merely been waiting until it was safe, until they were sure no hunters knew this was a Bene Gesserit-planned Atreides scion.\\n\\n Odrade saw a great deal of money passed to the foster mother. The woman threw the money on the floor. But no voice was raised in objection. The adults in the scene knew where the power lay.\\n\\n Calling up those compressed emotions, Odrade could still see the woman take herself to a straight-backed chair beside the window onto the street, there to hug herself and rock back and forth, back and forth. Not a sound from her.\\n\\n The Reverend Mothers used Voice and their considerable wiles plus the smoke of drugging herbs and their overpowering presence to lure Odrade into their waiting groundcar.\\n\\n \"It will be just for a little while. Your real mother sent us.\"\\n\\n Odrade sensed the lies but curiosity compelled. My real mother!\\n\\n Her last view of the woman who had been her only known female parent was of that figure at the window rocking back and forth, a look of misery on her face, arms wrapped around herself.\\n\\n Later, when Odrade spoke of returning to the woman, that memory-vision was incorporated into an essential Bene Gesserit lesson.\\n\\n \"Love leads to misery. Love is a very ancient force, which served its purpose in its day but no longer is essential for the survival of the species. Remember that woman\u0027s mistake, the pain.\"\\n\\n Until well into her teens, Odrade adjusted by daydreaming. She would really return after she was a full Reverend Mother. She would go back and find that loving woman, find her even though she had no names except \"mama\" and \"Sibia.\" Odrade recalled the laughter of adult friends who had called the woman \"Sibia.\"\\n\\n Mama Sibia.\\n\\n The Sisters, however, detected the daydreams and searched out their source. That, too, was incorporated into a lesson.\\n\\n \"Daydreaming is the first awakening of what we call simulflow. It is an essential tool of rational thought. With it you can clear the mind for better thinking.\"\\n\\n Simulflow.\\n\\n Odrade focused on Taraza at the morning room table. Childhood trauma must be placed carefully into a reconstructed memory-place. All of that had been far away on Gammu, the planet that the people of Dan had rebuilt after the Famine Times and the Scattering. The people of Dan - Caladan in those days. Odrade took a firm grip on rational thought, using the stance of the Other Memories that had flooded into her awareness during the spice agony when she had really become a full Reverend Mother.\\n\\n Simulflow... the filter of consciousness... Other Memories.\\n\\n What powerful tools the Sisterhood had given her. What dangerous tools. All of those other lives lay there just beyond the curtain of awareness, tools of survival, not a way to satisfy casual curiosity.\\n\\n Taraza spoke, translating from the material that scrolled past her eyes: \"You dig too much in your Other Memories. That drains away energies better conserved.\"\\n\\n The Mother Superior\u0027s blue-in-blue eyes sent a piercing stare upward at Odrade. \"You sometimes go right to the edge of fleshly tolerance. That can lead to your premature death.\"\\n\\n \"I am careful with the spice, Mother.\"\\n\\n \"And well you should be! A body can take only so much melange, only so much prowling in its past!\"\\n\\n \"Have you found my flaw?\" Odrade asked.\\n\\n \"Gammu!\" One word but an entire harangue.\\n\\n Odrade knew. The unavoidable trauma of those lost years on Gammu. They were a distraction that had to be rooted out and made rationally acceptable.\\n\\n \"But I am sent to Rakis,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n \"And see that you remember the aphorisms of moderation. Remember who you are!\"\\n\\n Once more, Taraza bent to her display.\\n\\n I am Odrade, Odrade thought.\\n\\n In the Bene Gesserit schools where first names tended to slip away, roll call was by last name. Friends and acquaintances picked up the habit of using the roll-call name. They learned early that sharing secret or private names was an ancient device for ensnaring a person in affections.\\n\\n Taraza, three classes ahead of Odrade, had been assigned to \"bring the younger girl along,\" a deliberate association by watchful teachers. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heretics-of-dune-dune-chronicles-5/page-1.html","bookId":2157,"book":{"id":2157,"title":"Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Heretics of Dune (Dune Chronicles #5) \\n With more than ten million copies sold, Frank Herbert\u0027s magnificent Dune books stand among the major achievements of the human imagination.
