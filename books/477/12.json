{"id":38683,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 13 My name 1","content":"　　In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing.\\n\\n 　　It was my great-grandmother\u0027s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of horse—which is supposed to be bad luck if you\u0027re born female—but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don\u0027t like their women strong.\\n\\n 　　My great-grandmother. I would\u0027ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn\u0027t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just that, as if she were a fancy chandelier. That\u0027s the way he did it.\\n\\n 　　　　　　　　　　　　\\n\\n 　　在英语里，我的名字的意思是希望。在西班牙语里，它意味着太多的字母。它意味着哀伤，意味着等待。它就像数字九。一种泥泞的色彩。它是没到星期天早晨，爸爸刮胡子是播放的墨西哥唱片，呜咽的歌。\\n\\n 　　它过去是我曾祖母的名字，现在是我的。她也是一个属马的女人，和我一样，生在中国的马年——如果你生为女人，这会被认为是霉运——可是我想，这是个中国谎，因为，中国人和墨西哥人一样，不喜欢他们的女人强大。\\n\\n 　　我的曾祖母。要是我见过她多好，女人中的野马，野得不想嫁人。直到我的曾祖父用麻袋套住她的头把她扛走。就那样扛着，好像她是一盏华贵的枝型吊灯。那就是他的办法。\\n\\n 　　　　　　　　　　　　\\n\\n 　　*英文单词“letter”既可以是作“字母”解，也可以作“信”接。太多的信，意味着等待。通过这次隐义，句子前后意义得以贯通。\\n\\n 　　*作者说，9是10之前的那个数字，是变化之前的数字。她选用这个数字来传达一种等待的意味，因为“我”，是一个即将成年的孩子，在等待改变，等待成熟和绽放。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/84/1443.html","bookId":477,"book":{"id":477,"title":"The House on Mango Street芒果街上的小屋","description":"简介： The House on Mango Street is a coming-of-age novel by Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros, published in 1984.
