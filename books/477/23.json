{"id":38694,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 25 Louie,His Cousin\u0026His Other Cousin","content":"　　Louie\u0027s girl cousin is older than us. She lives with Louie\u0027s family because her own family is in Puerto Rico. Her name is Marin or Maris or something like that, and she wears dark nylons all the time and lots of makeup she gets free from selling Avon. She can\u0027t come out _gotta baby-sit with Louie\u0027s sisters- but she stands in the doorway a lot, all the time singing, clicking her fingers, the same song:\\n\\n 　　Apples, peaches, pumpkin pah-ay\\n\\n 　　You\u0027re in love and so am ah-ay\\n\\n 　　Louie\u0027s has another cousin. We only saw him once, but it was important. We were playing volleyball in the alley when he drove up in this great big yellow Cadillac whitewalls and a yellow scarf tied around the mirror. Louie\u0027s cousin has his arm out the window. He honked a couple of times and a lot of faces looked out from Louie\u0027s back window and then a lot of people came out—Louie, Marin and all the little sisters.\\n\\n 　　　　　　　　　　　　\\n\\n 　　路易加的小表姐比我们大。她住在路易家里，因为她自己家在波多黎各。她好像是叫玛琳或者玛芮斯，或者跟这差不多的名字。她总是穿暗色的尼龙丝袜，化很多妆，那是她推销雅芳的时候不花钱得来的。她没法出门——得照看路易的小姐妹们，可她常常站在门道里，一直唱着歌，打着响指。她只唱一首歌：\\n\\n 　　苹果桃儿南瓜派哟，\\n\\n 　　你在恋爱我也在哟。\\n\\n 　　路易还有一个表兄。我们只见过他一次，可那次很轰动。我们在巷子里玩排球，他开着一辆又大又气派的黄色卡迪拉克过来了，白璧轮胎，镜子上系着一条黄绶带。路易的表兄把胳膊伸在车窗外面。他摁了几下喇叭，许多张脸从路易加的后窗出来，接着，出来很多人——路易、玛琳和所有的小妹妹们。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/84/1454.html","bookId":477,"book":{"id":477,"title":"The House on Mango Street芒果街上的小屋","description":"简介： The House on Mango Street is a coming-of-age novel by Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros, published in 1984.
