And our house would have running water and pipes that worked. And inside it would have real stairs, not hallway stairs, but stairs inside like the house on T.V.And we\u0027d have a basement and at least three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn\u0027t have to tell everybody. Our house would be white with trees around it, a great big yard and grass growing without a fence. This was the house Papa talked about when he held a lottery ticket and this was the house mama dreamed up in the stories she told us before we went to bed.\n 　　　　　　　　　　　　\n 　　他们一直对我们说，有一天，我们会搬进一所房子，一所真正的大屋，永远属于我们，那样我们就不用每年搬家了。我们的房子会有自来水和好用的水管。里面还有真正的楼梯，不是门厅台阶，而是像电视上的房子里那样的楼梯。我们会有一个地下室和至少三个卫生间，那样洗澡的时间就不用告诉每个人。我们的房子会是白色的，四周是树木，还有一个很大的原子，草儿生长着，没有篱笆吧他们圈起来。这是爸爸手握彩票时提到的房子，这是妈妈在给我们讲睡前故事里幻想着的房子。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/84/1438.html","bookId":477,"book":{"id":477,"title":"The House on Mango Street芒果街上的小屋","description":"简介： The House on Mango Street is a coming-of-age novel by Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros, published in 1984.
