The Laundromat downstairs had been boarded up because it had been robbed two days before and the owner had painted on the wood YES WE\u0027RE OPEN so as not lose business.\n 　　There. I had to look to where she pointed –—— the third floor, the paint peeling, wooden bars Papa had nailed on the windows so we wouldn\u0027t fall out. You live there? The way she said it made me feel like nothing. There. I lived there. I nodded.\n 　　I knew then I had to have to house. A real house. One I could point to .but this isn\u0027t it. The house on Mango Street isn\u0027t it. For the time being, Mama says. Temporary, says Papa. But I know how those things go.\n 　　　　　　　　　　　　\n 　　我们住在Loomis时，有一回学校的嬷嬷经过那里，看到我在房前玩。楼下的自助洗衣店被用木板封了起来，因为两天前刚被洗劫过。为了不走掉生意，主人在木头上涂抹了几个字：“是的，我们在营业。”\n 　　那里。我不得不朝他指的地方看去——三层楼上，那里墙皮斑驳，窗上横着几根木条，是爸爸钉上去的，那样我们就不会掉出来。你住在那里？她说话的样子让我觉得自己什么都不是。那里，我住在那里。我点头。\n 　　于是，我明白，我得有一所房子。一所真正的大屋。一所可以指给别人看的房子。可这里不是。芒果街上的小屋不是。目前就这样，妈妈说。这是暂时的，爸爸说。可恶知道事情是怎样的。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/84/1440.html","bookId":477,"book":{"id":477,"title":"The House on Mango Street芒果街上的小屋","description":"简介： The House on Mango Street is a coming-of-age novel by Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros, published in 1984.
