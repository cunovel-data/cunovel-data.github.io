Esta muerto（2） , and then as if he just heard the news himself, crumples like a coat and cries, my brave Papa cries. I have never seen my Papa cry and don\u0027t know what to do. 　　I know he will have to go away, that he will take a plane to Mexico, all the uncles and aunts will be there, and they will have a black-and-white photo taken in front of the tomb with flowers shaped like spears in a white vase because this is how they send the dead away in that country. 　　And I think if my own Papa died what would I do. I hold my Papa in my arms. I hold and hold and hold him. 　　　　　　　　　　　　 　　你爷爷去世了。有天清晨很早的时候，爸爸到我房里来说。他不在了（1），说完，他好像自己才听到这个消息一样，人像件外套一样皱缩起来，哭了。我勇敢的爸爸哭了。我从来没看过爸爸哭，不知道该怎么办。 　　我知道他要走了，他会坐飞机去墨西哥，所以的叔叔婶婶都会去那里。他们会拍上一张黑白照片，在摆个白色花瓶的墓地边，花瓶里插着长矛状的花束。在那个国家李，人们就那样送别死者。 　　我想要是我自己的爸爸死去了我会做什么。于是我把爸爸抱在怀里，我要抱啊抱啊抱住他。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/84/1464.html","bookId":477,"book":{"id":477,"title":"The House on Mango Street芒果街上的小屋","description":"简介： The House on Mango Street is a coming-of-age novel by Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros, published in 1984.
