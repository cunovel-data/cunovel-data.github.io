It never obeys barrettes or bands. Carlos\u0027 hair is thick and straight. He doesn\u0027t need to comb it. Nenny\u0027s hair is slippery——slides out of your hand. And Kiki, who is the youngest, has hair like fur.\n 　　But my mother\u0027s hair, my mother\u0027s hair, like little rosettes, like little candy circles all curly and pretty because she pinned it in pincurls all day, sweet to put your nose into when she is holding you, holding you and you feel safe, is the warm smell of bread before you bake it, is the smell when she makes room for you on her side of the bed still warm with her skin, and you sleep near her, the rain outside falling and Papa snoring. The snoring, the rain, and Mama\u0027s hair that smells like bread.\n 　　只有妈妈的头发，妈妈的头发，好像一朵朵小小的玫瑰花结，一枚枚小小的糖果圈儿，全都那么拳曲，那么漂亮，因为她成天给它们上发卷。把鼻子伸进去闻一闻吧，当她搂着你时。当她搂着你时，你觉得那么安全，闻到的气味又那么香甜。是那种待烤的面包暖暖的香味，是那种她给你让出一角被窝时，和着体温散发的芬芳。你睡在她身旁，外面下着雨，爸爸打着鼾。哦，鼾声、雨声，还有妈妈那闻起来像面包的头发。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/84/1432.html","bookId":477,"book":{"id":477,"title":"The House on Mango Street芒果街上的小屋","description":"简介： The House on Mango Street is a coming-of-age novel by Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros, published in 1984.
