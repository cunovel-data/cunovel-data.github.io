{"id":88707,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"What she felt was a shivering jolt that began in her palm and ran up her arm like electricity. It left tingling in its wake. But the real shock was in her head. Her mind exploded. That was the only way she could describe it. A noiseless, heatless explosion that shattered her completely. All at once, Rashel couldn\u0027t support her own weight anymore. She could feel Quinn\u0027s arms supporting her. She had no sense of the room around her. She was floating in a white light and the only solid thing to hang on to was Quinn. It was something like the terror she\u0027d felt before... but it wasn\u0027t just terror. Impossibly, what she felt was more like wild elation. She realized that Quinn was holding her so tightly that it hurt. But even stronger than the sensation of his arms was the sense she had of his mind. A direct conduit seemed to have opened between them. She could feel his astonishment, his shock, his wonder. And she knew he could feel hers. It\u0027s telepathy, some distant part of herself said, trying desperately to get control again. It\u0027s some new vampire trick. But she knew it wasn\u0027t a trick. Quinn was as astounded as she was-she could feel that. Maybe he was even worse off. He was breathing rapidly and shallowly and a fine trembling seemed to have taken over Rashel held on to him, thinking crazy things. She wanted to comfort him. She could sense, probably better than he could himself, how frighteningly vulnerable he was under that frozen exterior. Like me, I suppose, Rashel thought giddily. And then she suddenly realized that he was feeling her vulnerability just as she had felt his. Fear welled up in her so sharply that she panicked. She tried to find a way to shut him out, to resist the way she resisted mind control-but she knew it was useless. He had gotten past her guard already. He was inside. \"It\u0027s all right,\" Quinn said, and she realized that he had stopped trembling. His voice was almost dispassionate, and at the same time madly gentle. Rashel had the feeling that he\u0027d decided that since he couldn\u0027t fight this thing, he might as well be as insane as possible. Strangest of all, she found his words reassuring. And there was fire under the ice that seemed to encase him. She could feel that now, and she had the dizzy sense that she was the first one to discover it. They had fallen to the floor somehow, and they were sitting just at the edge of the light. Quinn was holding her by the shoulders, precisely, and Rashel was astonished at her own response to the clinical grip. It stopped her breath, held her absolutely motionless. Then, just as precisely, every movement deliberate, Quinn found the end of her scarf and began to unwind it. He was still filled with that mad gentleness, that lunatic calm. And she wasn\u0027t stopping him. He was going to expose her face, and she wasn\u0027t doing a thing about it. She wanted him to. In spite of her terror, she wanted him to see her, to know who she was. She wanted to be face to face with him in that strange light that had enveloped both their minds. It didn\u0027t seem to matter what happened afterward. She said, \"John.\" He unwound another length of the scarf, preoccupied and intent as if he were making some archaeological discovery. \"You didn\u0027t tell me your name.\" It was a statement. He wasn\u0027t pushing her. She might as well write it out on a death warrant and hand it to him. Quinn could reveal himself to humans-but then Quinn could disappear completely if he wanted, hole up in some hidden vampire enclave where no human could search him out. Rashel couldn\u0027t. He knew she was a vampire hunter. If he knew her name and her face, he\u0027d have every power to destroy her. And the scariest thing of all was that some part of her didn\u0027t care. He was down to the last turn of the scarf. In a moment her face would be exposed to the air... and to vampire eyes that could see in this darkness. I\u0027m Rashel, Rashel thought. She couldn\u0027t quite get the words to her lips. She took a deep breath. And at the same instant a light blazed into her eyes. Not the ghostly light that had been in her mind. Real light, the beams from several high-power flashlights, harsh and horribly bright. They cut through the dark cellar and threw Rashel and Quinn into stark illumination. Rashel gasped. One hand instinctively flew to her scarf to keep it over her face. She felt as if she had been caught naked. And she was horrified to realize that she hadn\u0027t heard anyone come into the cellar. She had been completely absorbed, oblivious to her surroundings. What had happened to all her training? What was wrong with her? She couldn\u0027t see anything beyond the light. Her first thought was that it was Quinn\u0027s vampire Mends come to save him. He seemed to think it might be, too; at least he was standing shoulder to shoulder with her, even trying to push her back a little. With an odd pang, Rashel realized she could only guess what he was thinking now. The connection between them had been cleanly severed. Then a voice came from beyond the terrible brightness, a sharp voice filled with outrage. \"How did he get loose? What are you two doing?\" Vicky. I\u0027m going insane, Rashel thought. I completely forgot about her and the others coming back. No, I forgot about their existence. But there were more than three flashlights on the stairs. \"The Big E sent us some backup,\" Vicky was saying, and Rashel felt a surge of fear. She counted five flashlights, and in the edges of beams she caught the figures of a couple of sturdy-looking guys. Lancers. Rashel tried desperately to gather her wits. She knew what had to be done, at least. She nudged Quinn with her shoulder and whispered, \"Get out of here. There should be another stairway on the other side of the room. When you run for it, I\u0027ll get in their way.\" She pitched her voice so low that only vampire ears could hear it. The good thing about having her face veiled was that nobody could read her lips. But Quinn wasn\u0027t going. He looked as if he\u0027d just been awakened with a bucketful of ice water. Shocked, angry, and still a little dazed. He stood where he was, staring into all the flashlights like an animal at bay. The lights were advancing. Rashel could make out Vicky\u0027s figure now at the front. There was going to be a fight, and people were going to get killed. Steve\u0027s voice said, \"What did he do to you?\" \"What\u0027s she been doing with him, that\u0027s the question,\" Vicky snapped back. Then she said clearly, \"Remember, everybody, we want him alive.\" Rashel gave Quinn a harder shove. \"Go.\" When he just glared, she hissed, \"Don\u0027t you realize what they want to do to you?\" Quinn turned so that the advancing party couldn\u0027t see his face. He snarled, \"They\u0027re not exactly overjoyed with you either.\" \"I can take care of myself.\" Rashel was shaking with frustration. \"Just leave. Go!\" Quinn looked as angry with her as he was with the hunters. He didn\u0027t want her help, she realized. He wasn\u0027t used to taking anything from anyone, and to be forced to do it made him furious. But there wasn\u0027t any other choice. And Quinn finally seemed to recognize that. With one last glare at her, he broke and headed for the darkness at the other side of the cellar. The flashlights swung in confusion. Rashel, glad to be able to move, sprang between the vampire hunters and the stairway. And then there was a lot of fumbling and crashing, with people running into each other and swearing and yelling. Rashel enjoyed the chance to work off her frustration. She got in everyone\u0027s way long enough for a very fast vampire to disappear. After which it was just her and the vampire hunters. Five flashlights turned on her and seven amazed and angry people staring. Rashel got up and brushed herself off. Time to face the consequences. She stood, head high, looking at all of them. \"What happened?\" Steve said. \"Did he hypnotize you?\" Good old Steve. Rashel felt a rush of warmth toward him. But she couldn\u0027t use the out he was offering her. She said, \"I don\u0027t know what happened.\" And that was true. She couldn\u0027t even begin to explain to herself what had gone on between her and the vampire. She\u0027d never heard of anything like it. \"I think you let him get away on purpose,\" Vicky said. Rashel couldn\u0027t see Vicky\u0027s pale blue eyes, but she sensed that they were as hard as marbles. \"I think you planned it from the beginning-that\u0027s why you told us to go up to the street.\" \"Is that true?\" One of the flashlights swung down and suddenly Nyala was in front of Rashel, her body tense, her voice almost pleading. Her eyes were fixed on Rashel\u0027s, begging Rashel to say it wasn\u0027t so. \"Did you do it on purpose?\" All at once Rashel felt very tired. Nyala was fragile and unstable, and in her own mind she\u0027d made Rashel into a hero. Now that image was being shattered. For Nyala\u0027s sake, Rashel almost wished she could lie. But that would be worse in the end. She said expressionlessly, \"Yes. I did it on purpose.\" Nyala recoiled as if Rashel had slapped her. I don\u0027t blame you, Rashel thought. I think it\u0027s crazy, too. The truth was that the farther away she got from Quinn\u0027s presence, the less she could understand what she\u0027d done. It was beginning to seem like a dream, and not a very clear dream at that. \"But why?\" one of the Lancer boys at the back asked. The Lancers knew Rashel, knew her reputation. They didn\u0027t want to think the worst of her. Like Nyala, they desperately wanted an excuse. \"I don\u0027t know why,\" Rashel said, looking away. \"But he wasn\u0027t controlling my mind.\" Nyala exploded. \"I hate you,\" she burst out. She was trembling with fury, spitting out sentences at Rashel like poison darts. \"That vampire could have been the one who killed my sister. Or he could have known who did it. I was going to ask him that, but now I\u0027ll never get the chance. Because of you. You let him go. We had him and you let him go!\" \"It\u0027s more than that,\" Vicky put in, her voice cold and contemptuous. \"We were going to ask him about those teenage girls getting kidnapped. Now we can\u0027t. So it\u0027s going to keep happening, and it\u0027s all going to be your fault.\" And they were right. Even Nyala was right. How did Rashel know that Quinn hadn\u0027t killed Nyala\u0027s sister? \"You\u0027re a vampire lover,\" Vicky was saying. \"I could tell from the beginning. I don\u0027t know, maybe you\u0027re one of those damned Daybreakers who wants us all to get along, but you\u0027re not on our side.\" A couple of the Lancers started to protest at this, but Nyala\u0027s voice cut through them. \"She\u0027s on their side?\" She stared from Vicky to Rashel, her body rigid. \"You just wait. Just wait until I tell people that Rashel is the Cat and that she\u0027s really on the Night World side. You just wait.\" She\u0027s hysterical, Rashel realized. Even Vicky was looking surprised at this, as if she were uneasy at what she\u0027d started. \"Nyala, listen-\" Rashel began. But Nyala seemed to have reached some peak of fury at which nothing from outside could touch her. \"I\u0027ll tell everybody in Boston! You\u0027ll see!\" She whirled around and plunged toward the stairway as if she were going to start doing it right now. Rashel stared after her. Then she said to Vicky, \"You\u0027d better send a couple of the guys to catch up to her. She\u0027s not safe alone in this neighborhood.\" Vicky gave her a look that was half angry and half shaken. \"Yeah. Okay. Everybody but Steve go after her. You guys take her home.\" They left, not without a few backward glances at Rashel. \"We\u0027ll drive you back,\" Vicky said. Her voice wasn\u0027t warm, but it wasn\u0027t as hostile as it had been. \"I\u0027ll walk to my own car,\" Rashel said flatly. \"Fine.\" Vicky hesitated, then blurted, \"She probably won\u0027t do what she said. She\u0027s just upset.\" Rashel said nothing. Nyala had sounded-and looked-as if she meant to do exactly what she said. And if she did... Well, it would be an interesting question as to who would kill Rashel first, the vampires or the vampire hunters. Wednesday morning dawned with gray skies and icy rain. Rashel trudged from class to class at Wassa-guscus High, lost in thought. At home, her latest foster family left her alone-they were used to her going her own way. She sat in her small bedroom in the townhouse with the lights dimmed, thinking. She still couldn\u0027t understand what had happened to her, but with every hour the memory of it was fading steadily. It was too strange to fit into the reality of life, and it became more and more like a dream. One of those dreams in which you do things you would never ordinarily do, and are ashamed of when you wake up in the morning. All that warmth and closeness-she\u0027d felt that for a vampire? She\u0027d been excited by a parasite\u0027s touch? She\u0027d wanted to comfort a leech? And not just any leech, either. The infamous Quinn. The legendary human hater. How could she have let him go? How many people would suffer because of her lapse in sanity? Who knows, she decided finally, maybe it had been some kind of mind control. She certainly couldn\u0027t make any sense of it otherwise. By Thursday, one thing at least was clear in her mind. Vicky had been right about the consequences of what she\u0027d done. Rashel hadn\u0027t thought about that at the time, but now she had to face it. She had to make it right. She had to find the kidnapped girls on her own- if girls were getting kidnapped. There was nothing about missing teenagers in the Globe. But if it was happening, Rashel had to find out about it and stop it... if she could. Okay. So she\u0027d go back to Mission Hill tonight and start investigating. Check the warehouse area again-this time, her way. There was one other thing that was clear to her, that became obvious as she got her priorities straight. Something she had to do, not for Nyala, or for Vicky, or for the Lancers, but just for herself. For her own honor, and for everybody who lived in the world of sunlight. The next time she saw Quinn, she had to kill him. Rashel moved along the deserted street, keeping to the shadows, moving silently. Not easy when the ground was wet and strewn with broken glass. There were no sidewalks, no grass, no plant life of any kind except the dead weeds in the abandoned lots. Just soggy trash and shattered bottles. A grim place. It fit Rashel\u0027s mood as she made her way stealthily toward the abandoned project building where Vicky had brought them Tuesday night. From its front door, she surveyed the rest of the street. Lots of warehouses. Several of them were protected with high chain-link fences topped with barbed wire. All of them had barred windows-or no windows-and metal freight doors. The security precautions didn\u0027t bother Rashel. She knew how to cut chain-link and pick locks. What bothered her was that she didn\u0027t know where to start. The Night People could be using any of the warehouses. Even knowing where Steve and Vicky had fought Quinn didn\u0027t help, because he had jumped them. He\u0027d obviously seen them lying in ambush and deliberately gone after them. Which meant his real destination could have been any of the buildings on this street-or none of them. All right. Patience was indicated here. She\u0027d just have to start at one end . . Rashel lost her thought and leaped back into the shadows before she consciously realized why she was doing it. Her ears had picked up a sound-a low rumbling coming from somewhere across the street. She flattened herself against the brick wall behind her, then kept her body absolutely immobile. Her eyes darted from building to building and she held her breath to hear better. There. It was coming from inside that warehouse, the one down at the far end of the street. And she could identify it now-the sound of an engine. As she watched, the freight door in the front of the warehouse went sliding up. Headlights pierced the night from behind it. A truck was pulling out onto the street. Not a very big truck. A U-Haul. It cleared the doors and stopped. A figure was pulling the sliding metal door down. Now it was making its way to the cab of the U-Haul, climbing in. Rashel strained her eyes, trying to make out any signs of vampirism in the figure\u0027s movements. She thought she could detect a certain telltale fluidity to the walk, but it was too far away to be sure. And there was nothing else to give her a clue about what was going on. It could be a human, she thought. Some warehouse owner going home after a night of balancing books. But her instinct told her differently. The hair at the back of her neck was standing on end. And then, as the truck began to cruise off, something happened that settled her doubts and sent her flying down the street. The back doors of the U-Haul opened just a bit, and a girl fell out. She was slender, and a streetlight caught her blond hair. She landed on the rubble-strewn road and lay there for an instant as if dazed. Then she jumped up, looked around wildly, and started running in Rashel\u0027s direction.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-6.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
