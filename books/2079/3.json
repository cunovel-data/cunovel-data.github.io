{"id":88704,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"God, it stank. RashelJordan had seen a lot of vampire lairs in her seventeen years, but this was probably the most disgusting. She held her breath as she stirred the nest of tattered cloth with the toe of one boot. She could read the story of this collection of garbage as easily as if the inhabitant had written out a full confession, signed it, and posted it on the wall. One vampire. A rogue, an outcast who lived on the fringe of both the human world and the Night World. He probably moved to anew city every few weeks to avoid getting caught. And he undoubtedly looked like any other homeless guy, except that none of the human homeless would be hanging around aBoston dock on a Tuesday night in early March. He brings his victims here, Rashel thought. The pier\u0027s deserted, it\u0027s private, he can take his time with them. And of course he can\u0027t resist keeping a few trophies. Her foot stirred them gently. A pink-and-blue knit baby jacket, a plaid sash from a school uniform, a Spiderman tennis shoe. All bloodstained. All very small. There had been a rash of missing children lately. TheBoston police would never discover where they had gone-but now Rashel knew. She felt her lips draw back slightly from her teeth in something that wasn\u0027t really a smile. She was aware of everything around her: the soft plash of water against the wooden pier, the rank coppery smell that was almost a taste, the darkness of a night lit only by a half moon. Even the light moisture of the cold breeze against her skin. She was aware of all of it without being preoccupied with any of it-and when the tiny scratch sounded behind her, she moved as smoothly and gracefully as if she were taking her turn in a dance. She pivoted on her left foot, drawing her bokken in the same motion, and without a break in the movement, she stabbed straight to the vampire\u0027s chest. She drove the blow from her hips, exhaling in a hiss as she did it, putting all her strength behind it. \"Gotta be faster than that,\" she said. The vampire, skewered like a hot dog, waved his arms and gibbered. He was dressed in filthy clothing and his hair was a bushy tangle. His eyes were wide, full of surprise and hatred, shining as silver as an animal\u0027s in the faint light. His teeth weren\u0027t so much fangs as tusks: fully extended, they reached almost to his chin. \"I know,\" Rashel said. \"You really, really wanted to kill me. Life\u0027s tough, isn\u0027t it?\" The vampire snarled one more time and then the silver went out of his eyes, leaving only the look of astonishment. His body stiffened and slumped backward. It lay still on the ground. Grimacing, Rashel pulled her wooden sword out of the chest. She started to wipe the blade on the vampire\u0027s pants, then hesitated, peering at them more closely. Yes, those were definitely little crawly things. And the blankets were just as repulsive. Oh, well. Use your own jeans. It won\u0027t be the first time. She carefully wiped the bokken clean. It was two and a half feet long and just slightly, gracefully curved, with a narrow, sharp, angled tip. Designed to penetrate a body as efficiently as possible-if that body was susceptible to wood. The sword slipped back into its sheath with a papery whisper. Then Rashel glanced at the body again. Mr. Vampire was already going mummified. His skin was now yellow and tough; his staring eyes were dried up, his lips shrunken, his tusks collapsed. Rashel bent over him, reaching into her back pocket. What she pulled out looked like the snapped-off end of a bamboo backscratcher-which was exactly what it was. She\u0027d had it for years. Very precisely, Rashel drew the five lacquered fingers of the scratcher down the vampire\u0027s forehead. On the yellow skin five brown marks appeared, like the marks of a cat\u0027s claws. Vampire skin was easy to mark tight after death. \"This kitten has claws,\" she murmured. It was a ritual sentence; she\u0027d repeated it ever since the night she\u0027d killed her first vampire at the age of twelve. In memory of her mother, who\u0027d always called her kitten. In memory of herself at age five, and all the innocence she\u0027d lost. She\u0027d never be a helpless kitten again. Besides, it was a little joke. Vampires... bats. Herself... a cat. Anybody who\u0027d grown up with Batman and Catwoman would get it. Well. All done. Whistling softly, she rolled the body over and over with her foot to the end of the pier. She didn\u0027t feel like carting the mummy all the way out to the fens, the salt marshes where bodies were traditionally left inBoston . With a mental apology to everybody who was trying to clean up the harbor, she gave the corpse a final push and listened for the splash. She was still whistling as she emerged from the pier onto the street. Hi-ho, hi-ho, it\u0027s off to work we go--- She was in a very good mood. The only disappointment was the constant one, that it hadn\u0027t been the vampire, the one she\u0027d been looking for ever since she\u0027d been five years old. It had been a rogue, all right-a depraved monster who killed human kids foolishly close to human habitations. But it hadn\u0027t been the rogue. Rashel would never forget his face. And she knew that someday she would see it again. Meanwhile, there was nothing to do but shish-kebab as many of the parasites as possible. She scanned the streets as she walked, alert for any sign of Night People. All she saw were quiet brick buildings and streetlights shining pale gold. And that was a shame, because she was in terrific form tonight; she could feel it. She was every bloodsucking leech\u0027s worst enemy. She could stake six of them before breakfast and still be fresh for chemistry first period at Wassaguscus High. Rashel stopped suddenly, absent-mindedly melting into a shadow as a police car cruised silently down the cross-street ahead. I know, she thought. I\u0027ll go see what the Lancers are up to. If anybody knows where vampires are, they do. She headed for the North End. Half an hour later she was standing in front of a brownstone apartment building, ringing the buzzer. \"Who\u0027s there?\" Instead of answering, Rashel said, \"The night has a thousand eyes.\" \"And the day only one,\" came the reply from the intercom. \"Hey there, girl. Come on up.\" Inside, Rashel climbed a dark and narrow stairway to a scarred wooden door. There was a peephole in the door. Rashel faced it squarely, then pulled off the scarf she\u0027d been wearing. It was black, silky, and very long. She wore it wrapped around her head and face like a veil, so that only her eyes showed, and even they were in shadow. She shook out her hair, knowing what the person on the other side could see. A tall girl dressed like a ninja, all hi black, with black hair falling loose around her shoulders and green eyes blazing. She hadn\u0027t changed much since she was five, except in height. Right now she made a barbaric face at the peephole and heard the sound of laughter behind the door as bolts were drawn. She waited until the door was shut behind her again before she said, \"Hi, Elliot.\" Elliot was a few years older than she was, and thin, with intense eyes and little shiny glasses that were always slipping off his nose. Some people would have dismissed him as a geek. But Rashel had once seen him stand up to two werewolves while she got a human girl out a window, and she knew that he had practically single-handedly started the Lancers-one of the most successful organizations of vampire hunters on the east coast. \"What\u0027s up, Rashel? It\u0027s been a while.\" \"I\u0027ve been busy. But now I\u0027m bored. I came to see if you guys had anything going.\" As Rashel spoke, she was looking at the other people in the room. A brown-haired girl was kneeling, loading objects from boxes into a dark green backpack. Another girl and a boy were sitting on the couch. Rashel recognized the boy from other Lancers meetings, but neither of the girls were familiar. \"Lucky you,\" Elliot said. \"This is Vicky, my new second-in-command.\" He nodded at the girl on the floor. \"She just moved toBoston ; she was the leader of a group on the south shore. And tonight she\u0027s taking a little expedition out to some warehouses in Mission Hill. We got a lead that there\u0027s been some activity out there.\" \"What kind of activity? Leeches, puppies?\" Elliot shrugged. \"Vampires definitely. Werewolves maybe. There\u0027s been a rumor about teenage girls getting kidnapped and stashed somewhere around there. The problem is we don\u0027t know exactly where, or why.\" He tilted his head, his eyes twinkling. \"You want to go?\" \"Isn\u0027t anybody going to ask me?\" Vicky said, straightening up from her backpack. Her pale blue eyes were fixed on Rashel. \"I\u0027ve never even seen this girl before. She could be one of them.\" Elliot pushed his glasses higher on his nose. He looked amused. \"You wouldn\u0027t say that if you knew, Vicky. Rashel\u0027s the best.\" \"At what?\" \"At everything. When you were going to your fancy prep school, she was out in theChicago slums staking vampires. She\u0027s been inL.A. ,New York ,New Orleans... even Vegas. She\u0027s wiped out more parasites than the rest of us put together.\" Elliot glanced mischievously at Rashel, then leaned toward Vicki. \"Ever heard of the Cat?\" he said. Vicki\u0027s head snapped up. She stared at Rashel. \"The Cat? The one all the Night People are afraid of? The one they\u0027re offering a reward for? The one who leaves a mark-\" Rashel shot Elliot a warning look. \"Never mind,\" she said. She wasn\u0027t sure she trusted these new people. Vicky was right about one thing: you couldn\u0027t be too careful. And she didn\u0027t like Vicky much, but she could hardly turn down such a good opportunity for vampire hunting. Not tonight, when she was in such terrific form. \"I\u0027ll go with you-if you\u0027ll have me,\" she said. Vicky\u0027s pale blue eyes bored into Rashel\u0027s a moment, then she nodded. \"Just remember I\u0027m in charge.\" \"Sure,\" Rashel murmured. She could see Elliot\u0027s grin out of the corner of her eye. \"You know Steve, and that\u0027s Nyala.\" Elliot indicated the boy and girl on the couch. Steve had blond hair, muscular shoulders, and a steady expression; Nyala had skin like cocoa and a faraway look in her eyes, as if she were sleepwalking. \"Nyala\u0027s new. She just lost her sister a month ago,\" Elliot added in a gentle voice. He didn\u0027t need to say how the sister had been lost. Rashel nodded at the girl. She sympathized. There was nothing quite like the shock of first discovering the Night World, when you realized that things like vampires and witches and werewolves were real, and that they were everywhere, joined in one giant secret organization. That anybody could be one, and you\u0027d never know until it was too late. \"Everybody ready? Then let\u0027s go,\" Vicky said, and Steve and Nyala got up. Elliot showed them to the door. \"Good luck,\" he said. Outside, Vicky led the way to a dark blue car with mud strategically caked on the license plates. \"We\u0027ll drive to the warehouse area,\" she said. Rashel was relieved. She was used to walking the city streets at night without being seen-important when you were carrying a rather unconcealable sword-but she wasn\u0027t sure that these other three could manage. It took practice. The drive was silent except for the murmur of Steve\u0027s voice occasionally helping Vicky with directions. They passed through respectable neighborhoods and venerable areas with handsome old buildings until they got to a street where everything changed suddenly. All at once, as if they had crossed some invisible dividing line, the gutters were full of soggy trash and the fences were topped with razor wire. The buildings were government housing projects, dark warehouses, or rowdy bars. Vicky pulled into a parking lot and stopped the car away from the security lights. Then she led them through the knee-high dead weeds of a vacant lot to a street that was poorly lighted and utterly silent. \"This is the observation post,\" Vicky whispered, as they reached a squat brick building, a part of the housing project that had been abandoned. Following her, they zigzagged through debris and scrap metal to get to a side door, and then they climbed a dark staircase covered with graffiti to the third floor. Their flashlights provided the only illumination. \"Nice place,\" Nyala whispered, looking around. She had obviously never seen anything like it before. \"Don\u0027t you think-there may be other people here besides vampires?\" Steve gave her a reassuring pat. \"No, it\u0027s okay.\" \"Yeah, it looks like even the junkies have abandoned it,\" Rashel said, grimly amused. \"You can see the whole street from the window,\" Vicky put in shortly. \"Elliot and I were here yesterday watching those warehouses across the street. And last night we saw a guy at the end of the street who looked a lot like a vampire. You know the signs.\" Nyala opened her mouth as if to say she didn\u0027t know the signs, but Rashel was already speaking. \"Did you test him?\" \"We didn\u0027t want to get that close. We\u0027ll do it tonight if he shows up again.\" \"How do you test them?\" Nyala asked. Vicky didn\u0027t answer. She and Steve had pushed aside a couple of rat-chewed mattresses and were unloading the bags and backpacks they\u0027d brought. Rashel said, \"One way is to shine a flashlight in their eyes. Usually you get eye-shine back-like an animal\u0027s.\" \"There are other ways, too,\" Vicky said, setting the things she was unloading on the bare boards of the floor. There were ski masks, knives made of both metal and wood, a number of stakes of various sizes, and a mallet. Steve added two clubs made of white oak to the pile. \"Wood hurts them more than metal,\" Vicky said to Nyala. \"If you cut them with a steel knife they heal right before your eyes-but cut them with wood and they keep bleeding.\" Rashel didn\u0027t quite like the way she said it. And she didn\u0027t like the last thing Vicky was pulling out of her backpack. It was a wooden device that looked a bit like a miniature stock. Two hinged blocks of wood that fit snugly around a person\u0027s wrists and closed with a lock. \"Vampire handcuffs,\" Vicky said proudly, seeing her look. \"Made of white oak. Guaranteed to hold any parasite. I brought them from down south.\" \"But hold them for what? And what do you need all those little knives and stakes for? It would take hours to kill a vampire with those.\" Vicky smiled fiercely. \"I know.\" Oh. Rashel\u0027s heart seemed to thump and then sink, and she looked away to control her reaction. She understood what Vicky had in mind now. Torture. \"A quick death\u0027s too good for them,\" Vicky said, still smiling. \"They deserve to suffer-the way they make our people suffer. Besides, we might get some information. We need to know where they\u0027re keeping the girls they kidnap, and what they\u0027re doing with them.\" \"Vicky.\" Rashel spoke earnestly. \"It\u0027s practically impossible to make vampires talk. They\u0027re stubborn. When they\u0027re hurt they just get angry-like animals.\" Vicky smirked. \"I\u0027ve made some talk. It just depends on what you do, and how long you make it last. Anyway, there\u0027s no harm in trying.\" \"Does Elliot know about this?\" Vicky lifted a shoulder defensively. \"Elliot lets me do things my way. I don\u0027t have to tell him every little detail. I was a leader myself, you know.\" Helplessly, Rashel looked at Nyala and Steve. And saw that for the first time Nyala\u0027s eyes had lost their sleepwalking expression. Now she looked awake- and savagely glad. \"Yes,\" she said. \"We should try to make the vampire talk. And if he suffers-well, my sister suffered. When I found her, she was almost dead but she could still talk. She told me what it felt like, having all the blood drained out of her body while she was still conscious. She said it hurt. She said...\" Nyala stopped, swallowed, and looked at Vicky. \"I want to help do it,\" she said thickly. Steve didn\u0027t say anything, but then from what Rashel knew of him, that was typical. He was a guy of few words. Anyway, he didn\u0027t protest. Rashel felt odd, as if she were seeing the very worst of herself reflected in a mirror. It made her... ashamed. It left her shaken. But who am I to judge? she thought, turning away. It\u0027s true that the parasites are evil, all of them. The whole race needs to be wiped out. And Vicky\u0027s right, why should they have a clean death, when they usually don\u0027t give their victims one? Nyala deserves to avenge her sister. \"Unless you object or something,\" Vicky said heavily, and Rashel could feel those pale blue eyes on her. \"Unless you\u0027re some kind of vampire sympathizer.\" Rashel might have laughed at that, but she wasn\u0027t in a laughing mood. She took a breath, then said without turning around, \"It\u0027s your show. I agreed that you were in charge.\" \"Good,\" Vicky said, and returned to her work. But the sick feeling in the pit of Rashel\u0027s stomach didn\u0027t go away. She almost hoped that the vampire wouldn\u0027t come.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-3.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
