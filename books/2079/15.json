{"id":88716,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"The sound of her own voice sent Rashel spinning out of the light. It was as if she were emerging from deep water- from one world into another. Or as if she were re-entering her own body. For a moment everything was confusion, and Rashel wasn\u0027t sure of where she was or how she was positioned... and then she felt her arms and legs and saw yellow light. Lamplight. She was in an upstairs room in a mansion on a private island, and Quinn was holding her. They had somehow ended up on the floor, half kneeling, half supported by the wall, their arms around each other, Rashel\u0027s head on his shoulder. She had no idea when he\u0027d stopped biting her. She also had no idea how much time had passed. She coughed a little, shaken by what had just happened. That other place, with the light-it still seemed more real than the hard shiny boards of the floor underneath her and the white walls of the room. But it also seemed encased in its own reality. Like a dream. She didn\u0027t know if they would ever be able to get back there again. \"Quinn?\" He was Quinn again. Not John. \"Yes.\" \"Do you know what happened? I mean, do you understand it?\" \"I think,\" he said, and his voice was gentle and precise, \"that sharing blood can strengthen a telepathic bond. I\u0027ve always been able to block it out when I fed before, but...\" He didn\u0027t finish. \"But it happened that other time. Or something like it happened. When I first met you.\" \"Yes. Well. Well, I think it\u0027s... there\u0027s something called...\" He gave up and resorted to nonverbal communication. There\u0027s something called the soulmate principle. I\u0027ve never believed in it. I\u0027ve laughed at people who talked about it. I would have bet my life that- \"What is it, Quinn?\" Rashel had heard of it, too, especially recently. But it wasn\u0027t something from her world, and she wanted a Night Person to explain. It\u0027s the idea that everyone has one and just one soul-mate in the world, and that if you find them, you recognize them immediately. And... well, that\u0027s that. \"But it\u0027s not supposed to happen between humans and Night People. Right?\" There are some people who think that it is happening-now-for some reason-especially between humans and Night People. The Redferns seem to be getting it in particular. There was a pause, then Quinn said aloud, \"I should probably apologize to some of them, actually.\" He sounded bemused. Rashel sat up, which was difficult. She didn\u0027t want to let go of Quinn. He kept hold of her fingers, which helped a little. He looked more mussed than he had down near the wharf, his neat hair disordered, his eyes large and dark and dazed. She met his gaze directly. \"You think we\u0027re soulmates?\" \"Well.\" He blinked. \"Do you have a better explanation?\" \"No.\" She took a breath. \"Do you still want to make me a vampire?\" He stared at her, and something flamed and then fell in pain in his eyes. For an instant he looked as if she\u0027d hit him-then all she could see was regret. \"Oh, Rashel\" In one motion he caught her and held her. His face was pressed to her hair. She could feel him breathing like some stricken creature-and then she felt him regain control, grabbing discipline from somewhere, wrapping himself in it. He rested his chin on her head. \"I\u0027m sorry you have to ask that, but I understand. I don\u0027t want to make you a vampire. I want-\" I want you to be what you were two minutes ago. That happy, that idealistic.... He sounded as if it were something that had been lost forever. But Rashel felt a new happiness, and a new confidence. He had changed. She could sense how much he had changed already. They were in the real world, and he wasn\u0027t raving about needing to kill her, or her needing to kill him. \"I just wanted to be sure,\" she said. She tightened her own arms around him. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen-but as long as we\u0027re right together, I think I can face it.\" I think we live or die together from now on, Quinn said simply. Yes, Rashel thought. She could still feel lingering sadness in Quinn, and confusion in herself, but they were right together. She didn\u0027t need to doubt him anymore. They trusted each other. \"We have to do something about the people downstairs,\" she said. \"Yes.\" \"But we can\u0027t kill them.\" \"No. There\u0027s been enough killing. It has to stop.\" Quinn sounded like a swimmer who\u0027d been tumbling in a riptide, and whose feet had finally found solid ground. Rashel sat up to look at him. \"But we can\u0027t just let them walk out of here. What if they try it again? I mean, whoever set this bloodfeast up...\" She suddenly realized that she had asked everybody else, but not him. \"Quinn, who did set this up?\" He smiled, a faint echo of his old savage smile. Now it was grim and self-mocking. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"You don\u0027t know?\" \"Some vampire who wanted to get the made vampires together. But I\u0027ve never met him. Lily was the go-between, but I\u0027m not sure she knows either. She only spoke to him on the phone. Neither of us asked a lot of questions. We were doing it for the money.\" He said it flatly, not sparing himself. And to be rebellious, Rashel thought. To be as bad and as damned as possible, because you figured you might as well. She said, \"Whoever it is might just go somewhere else and find somebody else to get his slaves for him. Those seven guys could be having a new bloodfeast next month.\" \"That has to be stopped, too,\" Quinn said. \"How to stop it without violence, that\u0027s the question.\" His fingers were still tight on Rashel\u0027s, but he was staring into the distance, lost in grim and competent thought. It was a new side of Quinn. Rashel had seen him in almost every mood from despairing to manic, but she had never worked with him before. Now she realized that he was going to make a strong and resourceful Suddenly Quinn seemed to focus. \"I\u0027ve got it,\" he said. He smiled suddenly, mocking but without the bitterness. \"When violence won\u0027t work, there\u0027s no other choice but to try persuasion.\" \"That\u0027s not funny.\" \"It\u0027s not meant to be.\" \"You\u0027re going to say, \u0027Please don\u0027t kill any more young girls\u0027?\" \"I\u0027m going to say, \u0027Please don\u0027t kill any more young girls or I\u0027ll report you to the Joint Council.\u0027 Listen, Rashel.\" He took her by the arms, his eyes flashing with excitement. \"I have some authority in the Night World-I\u0027m the Redfern heir. And Hunter Redfern has more. Between us, we can make all kinds of trouble for these made vampires.\" \"But Fayth-a friend of mine-said they were all so powerful.\" In the intensity of the moment, Rashel almost missed the fact that she\u0027d just called Fayth her friend. Quinn was shaking his head. \"No, you have to understand. These aren\u0027t rogues, they\u0027re Night World citizens. And what they\u0027re doing is completely illegal. You can\u0027t just kill a bunch of girls from one area without permission. Slavery\u0027s illegal, bloodfeasts are illegal. And no matter how powerful they are, they can\u0027t stand up against the Night World Council.\" \"But-\" \"We threaten them with exposure to the Council. With exposure to Hunter Redfern-and to the lamia. The lamia will go crazy at the thought of made vampires getting together in some kind of alliance. They\u0027ll take it as a threat of civil war.\" It might work, Rashel was thinking. The made vampires were just individuals-they\u0027d be up against whole lamia families. Especially against the Redfern family, the oldest and most respected clan of vampires. \"Everybody\u0027s scared of Hunter Redfern,\" she said slowly. \"He\u0027s got tremendous influence. He practically owns the Council. He could run them out of the Night World if he wanted. I think they\u0027ll listen.\" \"You really do think of him as a father, don\u0027t you?\" Rashel said, her voice soft. She searched Quinn\u0027s eyes. \"Whatever you say about hating him-you respect him.\" \"He\u0027s not as bad as most. He has... honor, I guess. Usually.\" And he\u0027s a New Englander, Rashel thought. That means he\u0027s against vice. She considered another moment, then she nodded. Her heart was beating fast, but she could feel a smile breaking on her face. \"Let\u0027s try persuasion.\" They stood-and then they paused a moment, looking at each other. We\u0027re strong, Rashel thought. We\u0027ve got unity. If anyone can do this, we can. She picked up her knife almost absent-mindedly. It was a piece of art, a valued possession, and she didn\u0027t want to lose it. They walked down the stairs side by side. Music was still blasting from the gathering room at the end of the hall. It hadn\u0027t been that long, Rashel realized. The whole world had changed since she\u0027d been in this hallway-but somehow it had all happened in minutes. Now, Quinn said silently before they went in. There shouldn\u0027t be any danger-/ don\u0027t think they\u0027ll be stupid enough to attack me-but be alert anyway. Rashel nodded. She felt cool and businesslike, and she thought she was perfectly rational. It was only later that she realized they had walked into the room like little lambs into the tiger\u0027s lair, still dizzy and reeling from the discovery of love. Quinn went in first and she could hear voices stop as he did. Then she was walking through the door, into that ruddy flickering room with shadows dancing on the walls. And there they were again, those handsome young guys who looked like a TV-series ensemble. They were looking at Quinn with various expressions of interest and surprise. When they saw her, the expressions sharpened to pleasure and inquiry. \"Hey, Quinn!\" \"Hi there, Quinn.\" \"So you\u0027ve arrived at last. You\u0027ve kept us waiting long enough.\" That from the dark one who was looking at his watch. Quinn said, \"Turn off the music.\" Someone went to a built-in mahogany cabinet and turned off an expensive stereo. Quinn was looking around the room, as if to appraise each of them. \"Campbell,\" he said, nodding slightly. \"Radhu. Azarius. Max.\" \"So you\u0027re the one who brought us here,\" Campbell said. He had rusty hair and a sleepy smile. \"We\u0027ve all been dying to find out.\" \"Who\u0027s that?\" someone else added, peering at Rashel. \"The first course?\" Quinn smiled fractionally, with a look that made the guy who\u0027d asked step backward. \"No, she\u0027s not the first course,\" he said softly. \"In fact, unfortunately, all the courses have disappeared.\" There was a silence. Everyone stared at him. Then the guy with the silver-blond hair said, \"What?\" \"They\u0027ve all-just-disappeared.\" Quinn made an expressive gesture. \"Escaped. Vanished.\" Another silence. Rashel didn\u0027t like this one. She was beginning to get an odd impression from the group, as if she were in a room, not with people, but with animals that had been kept past their feeding time. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" the dark one, the one Quinn had called Azarius, said tightly. \"What kind of joke is this?\" Campbell added. \"It\u0027s not a joke. The girls who were brought for the bloodfeast are gone,\" Quinn said slowly and distinctly, just in case anybody hadn\u0027t gotten it yet. Then he said, \"And as a matter of fact, it\u0027s a good thing.\" \"A good thing? Quinn, we\u0027re starving.\" \"They can\u0027t have gone too far,\" the silver blond said. \"After all, it\u0027s an island. Let\u0027s go and-\" \"Nobody\u0027s going anywhere,\" Quinn said. Rashel moved closer to him. She was still nervous. These guys were on the edge of getting out of control. But she trusted Quinn, and she could tell they were afraid of him. And, she told herself, they\u0027ll be even more afraid in a minute. \"Look, Quinn, if you brought us here to-\" \"I didn\u0027t bring you here. In fact, I don\u0027t know who brought you here, but it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ve got the same thing to say to all of you. There isn\u0027t going to be any bloodfeast, now or ever. And anybody who objects to that can take their problem to the Council.\" That shut everyone up. They simply stared at Quinn. It was clearly the last thing they expected. \"In fact, if you don\u0027t want the Council to hear about this, I\u0027d advise everybody to go home quietly and pretend it never happened. And to have a headache the next time anybody asks you to a bloodfeast.\" This silence was broken by somebody muttering, \"You dirty...\" Meanwhile, Rashel\u0027s mind had begun to tick. Just how were these guys going to go home quietly? There weren\u0027t any boats. Unless the host brought one when he came-if he came. And where was he, anyway? And where was Lily? \"Quinn,\" she said softly. But somebody else was speaking. \"You\u0027d tell the Council?\" a lean tough-looking guy with brown hair asked. \"No, I\u0027d let Hunter Redfern tell the Council,\" Quinn said. \"And I don\u0027t really think you want that. He might put it in a bad light. Raise your hands everybody who thinks Hunter Redfern would approve of this little party.\" \"Do I get a vote?\" The voice came from the doorway. It was deeper than the voices of the young guys in the room. Rashel recognized the sound of danger instinctively and turned. And later it seemed to her that even before she turned, she knew what she would see. A tall man standing easily, with a girl and a child behind him in the shadows. He was colored by the flickering ruby light of the fire, but Rashel could still see that his hair was red as blood. And his eyes were Golden like hawk\u0027s eyes, like amber. Like Lily Redfern\u0027s eyes. Why hadn\u0027t she realized that before? The face was a face she would never forget. It came to her every night in her dreams. It was the man who\u0027d killed her mother. The man who\u0027d chased her through the climbing structure, promising her ice cream. All at once, Rashel was five years old again, weak and helpless and terrified. \"Hello, Quinn,\" Hunter Redfern said. Quinn was absolutely still beside Rashel. She had the feeling that he couldn\u0027t even think. And she understood why. She\u0027d seen into his mind; she knew what Hunter represented to him. Stern necessity, even ruthlessness, but honor, too. And he was just now finding out that that was all a lie. \"Don\u0027t look so upset,\" Hunter said. He stepped forward with an amiable smile. His golden eyes were fixed on Quinn; he hadn\u0027t even glanced at Rashel yet. \"There\u0027s a reason for all this.\" He gestured to the vampires in the room, and his voice was gentle, rational. \"We need allies in the Council; the lamia are getting too lax. Once I\u0027ve explained it all to you, you\u0027ll understand.\" The way he\u0027d made Quinn understand that Quinn had to be a vampire, Rashel thought. The way he\u0027d made Quinn understand that humans were the enemy. She was shaking all over, but there was a white-hot fire inside her that burned through the fear. \"Was there a reason for killing my mother?\" she said. The golden eyes turned toward her. Hunter looked mildly startled. Beside her, Quinn\u0027s head jerked around. \"I was only five, but I remember it all,\" Rashel said. She took a step closer to Hunter. \"You killed her just like that-snapped her neck. Was there a reason for killing Timmy? He was four years old and you drank his blood. Was there a reason for killing my great-aunt? You set a fire to get me, but it got her.\" She stopped, staring into those predatory golden eyes. She\u0027d searched for this man for twelve years, and now he didn\u0027t seem to recognize her. \"What\u0027s wrong, did you hunt too many little kids to keep track of?\" she said. \"Or are you so crazy you believe your own public image?\" Quinn whispered, \"Rashel...\" She turned. \"I\u0027m sure. He was the one.\" In that instant, she saw Quinn\u0027s face harden implacably against the man who\u0027d made him a Red-fern. His eyes went dark as black holes-no light escaped. Rashel suddenly had the feeling of glacial cold. Look into eyes like that and what you saw alone might kill you, she thought. But she had her own fire inside her, her own vengeance. The knife was in her waistband. If she could just get close enough.... She moved toward Hunter Redfern again. \"You destroyed my life. And you don\u0027t even remember, do you?\" \"I remember,\" the little shadow beside him said. And then the world flipped and Rashel felt the floor slipping away from her. The child behind Hunter was walking into the light-and suddenly she could smell plastic and old socks, and she could feel vinyl under her hands. Memories were flooding up so quickly that she was drowning in them. All she could say was \"Oh, Timmy. Oh, God, Timmy.\" He was standing there, just as she\u0027d seen him last, twelve years ago. Shiny dark hair and wide tilted blue eyes. Except that the eyes weren\u0027t exactly a child\u0027s eyes. They were some strange and terrible combination of child and adult. There was too much knowledge in them. \"You left me,\" Timmy said. \"You didn\u0027t care about me.\" Rashel sank her teeth into her lip, but tears spilled anyway. \"I\u0027m sorry...\" \"Nobody cared about me,\" Timmy said. He reached up to take Hunter\u0027s sleeve. \"No humans, anyway. Humans are vermin.\" He smiled his old sweet smile. Hunter looked down at Timmy, then up at Quinn. \"It\u0027s amazing how quickly they learn. You haven\u0027t met Timmy, have you? He\u0027s been living in Vegas, but I think he can be useful here.\" He turned to Rashel and his eyes were pure evil. \"Of course I remember you. It\u0027s just that you\u0027ve changed a little; you\u0027ve gotten older. You\u0027re different from us, you see.\" \"You\u0027re weak,\" Lily put in. She had stepped forward, too, to stand beside her father. Now she linked her arm in his. \"You\u0027re short-lived. You\u0027re not very bright, and not very important. In a word, you\u0027re... dinner.\" Hunter smiled. \"Well put.\" Then he dropped the smile and said to Quinn, \"Step away from her, son.\" Quinn moved slightly, closer to Rashel. \"This is my soulmate,\" he said, in his softest and most disturbing voice. \"And we\u0027re leaving together.\" Hunter Redfern stared at him for several long moments. Something like disbelief flickered in his eyes. Then he recovered and said quietly, \"What a shame.\" Behind Rashel there were noises of stirring. It was as if a hot wind from the savanna had blown in, and the lions had caught its scent. \"You know, I was already worried about you, Quinn,\" Hunter said. \"Last summer you let Ash and his sisters get away with running out on the enclave. Don\u0027t think I didn\u0027t notice that. You\u0027re getting lax, getting soft. There\u0027s too much of that going around lately.\" Stand back to back, Quinn told Rashel. She was already moving into position. The vampires were forming a ring, encircling them. She could see smiles on every face. \"And Lily says you\u0027ve been strange these last few days-moody. She said you seemed preoccupied with a human girl.\" Rashel drew her knife. The vampires were watching her with the fixed attention of big felines watching their prey. Absolute focus. \"But the soulmate idea-that\u0027s really the last straw. It\u0027s like a disease infecting our people. You understand why I have to stamp it out.\" Hunter paused. \"For old time\u0027s sake, let\u0027s finish this quickly.\" A voice that wasn\u0027t Quinn\u0027s added in Rashel\u0027s mind, / told you I\u0027d see you later. Rashel stood on the balls of her feet, letting Hunter\u0027s words slide off her and drip away. She couldn\u0027t think about him right now. She had to concentrate on awareness, open her energy, and free her mind. This was going to be the biggest fight of her fife, and she needed zanshin. But even as she found it, a small voice inside her was whispering the truth. There were simply too many vampires. She and Quinn couldn\u0027t hold them all off at once.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-15.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
