{"id":88706,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Rashel froze. Her sword remained in the air, poised over the vampire\u0027s heart.\\n\\n \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" the vampire said. \"Go on and do it.\"\\n\\n Rashel didn\u0027t know what she was waiting for. The vampire was in a position to block her sword with his\\n\\n wooden handcuffs, but he didn\u0027t do any such thing. She could tell by his body language that he wasn\u0027t\\n\\n going to, either. Instead he just lay there, looking up at her with eyes that were as dark and empty as the\\n\\n depths of space.\\n\\n His hair was tousled on his forehead and his mouth was a bleak line. He didn\u0027t seem afraid. He just went\\n\\n on staring with those fathomless eyes.\\n\\n All right, Rashel thought. Do it. Even the leech is telling you to. Do it fast-now.\\n\\n But instead she found herself pivoting and stepping slowly away from him.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" she said out loud. \"I don\u0027t take orders from parasites.\"\\n\\n She kept her sword at the ready in case he made any sudden moves. But all he did was glance down at\\n\\n the wooden handcuffs, wiggle his wrists in them, and then lie back.\\n\\n \"I see,\" he said with a strange smile. \"So it\u0027s torture this time, right? Well, that should be amusing for you.\"\\n\\n Stake him, dummy, came the little voice in Rashel\u0027s head. Don\u0027t talk to him. It\u0027s dangerous to get in a\\n\\n conversation with his kind.\\n\\n But she couldn\u0027t refocus herself. In a minute, she told the voice. First I have to get my own control back.\\n\\n She knelt in her ready-for-action crouch and picked up the flashlight, turning it full on his face. He\\n\\n blinked and looked away, squinting.\\n\\n There. Now she could see him, but he couldn\u0027t see her. Vampire eyes were hypersensitive to light. And\\n\\n even if he did manage to get a glimpse of her, she was wearing her scarf. She had all the advantages, and\\n\\n it made her feel more in command of the situation.\\n\\n \"Why would you think we want to torture you?\" she said.\\n\\n He smiled at the ceiling, not trying to look at her. \"Because I\u0027m still alive.\" He raised the handcuffs. \"And\\n\\n aren\u0027t these traditional? A few vampires from\\n\\n the south shore have turned up mutilated with stocks like these on. It seemed to have been done for fun.\"\\n\\n Smile.\\n\\n Vicky\u0027s work, Rashel thought. She wished he would stop smiling. It was such a disturbing smile,\\n\\n beautiful and a little mad.\\n\\n \"Unless,\" the vampire was going on, \"it\u0027s information you want.\"\\n\\n Rashel snorted. \"Would I be likely to get information from you if I did want it?\" \"Well.\" Smile. \"Not\\n\\n likely.\" \"I didn\u0027t think so,\" Rashel said dryly. He laughed out loud. Oh, God, Rashel thought. Stake him.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know what was wrong with her. Okay, he was charming-in a weird way. But she\u0027d known\\n\\n other charming vampires-smooth, practiced flatterers who tried to sweet-talk or cajole their way out of\\n\\n being staked. Some had tried to seduce her. Almost all had tried mind control. It was only because\\n\\n Rashel had the will to resist telepathy that she was alive today.\\n\\n But this vampire wasn\u0027t doing any of the ordinary things-and when he laughed, it made Rashers heart\\n\\n thump oddly. His whole face changed when he laughed. A sort of light shone in it. Girl, you are in trouble.\\n\\n Kill him quick. \"Look,\" she said, and she was surprised to find her voice a little shaky. \"This isn\u0027t\\n\\n personal. And you probably don\u0027t care, but I\u0027m not the one who was going to torture you. This is\\n\\n business, and it\u0027s what I have to do.\" She took a deep breath and reached for the sword by her knee.\\n\\n He turned his face to the light. He wasn\u0027t smiling now and there was no amusement in his voice when he\\n\\n said, \"I understand. You\u0027ve got... honor.\" Looking back at the ceiling, he added, \"And you\u0027re right, this\\n\\n is the way it always has to end when our two races meet. It\u0027s kill or be killed. The law of nature.\"\\n\\n He was speaking to her as one warrior to another. Suddenly Rashel felt something she\u0027d never felt for a\\n\\n vampire before. Respect. A strange wish that they weren\u0027t on opposite sides in this war. A regret that\\n\\n they could never be anything but deadly enemies.\\n\\n He\u0027s somebody I could talk to, she thought. An odd loneliness had taken hold of her. She hadn\u0027t realized\\n\\n she cared about having anyone to talk to.\\n\\n She found herself saying awkwardly, \"Is there anybody you want notified-afterward? I mean, do you\\n\\n have any family? I could make sure the news gets around, so they\u0027d know what had happened to you.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t expect him to actually give her any names. That would be crazy. In this game knowledge was\\n\\n power, with each side trying to find out who the players on the other side were. If you could identify\\n\\n someone as a vampire-or a vampire hunter-you knew who to kill.\\n\\n It was Batman and Catwoman all over. The important thing was to preserve your secret identity.\\n\\n But this vampire, who was obviously a lunatic, said thoughtfully, \"Well, you could send a note to my\\n\\n adopted father. He\u0027s Hunter Redfern. Sorry I can\u0027t give you an address, but he should be somewhere\\n\\n down east.\" Another smile. \"I forgot to tell you my name. It\u0027s Quinn.\"\\n\\n Rashel felt as if she\u0027d been hit with an oak club.\\n\\n Quinn.\\n\\n One of the most dangerous vampires in all the Night World. Maybe the most dangerous of the made\\n\\n vampires, the ones who\u0027d started out human. She knew him by reputation-every vampire hunter did. He\\n\\n was supposed to be a deadly fighter and a brilliant strategist; clever, resourceful... and cold as ice. He\\n\\n despised humans, held them in utter contempt. He wanted the Night World to wipe them out, except for\\n\\n a few to be used for food.\\n\\n I was wrong, Rashel thought dazedly. I should have let Vicky torture him. I\u0027m sure he deserves it, if any\\n\\n of them do. God only knows what he\u0027s done in his time.\\n\\n Quinn had turned his head toward her again, looking straight into the flashlight even though it must be\\n\\n hurting his eyes.\\n\\n \"So you see, you\u0027d better kill me fast,\" he said in a voice soft as snow falling. \"Because that\u0027s certainly\\n\\n what I\u0027m going to do to you if I get loose.\"\\n\\n Rashel gave a strained laugh. \"Am I supposed to be scared?\"\\n\\n \"Only if you have the brains to know who I am.\"\\n\\n Now he sounded tired and scornful. \"Which obviously you don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Well, let me see. I seem to remember something about the Redferns.... Aren\u0027t they the family who\\n\\n controls the vampire part of the Night World Council? The most important family of all the lamia, the\\n\\n born vampires. Descended directly from Maya, the legendary first vampire. And Hunter Redfern is their\\n\\n leader, the upholder of Night World law, the one who colonized America with vampires back in the\\n\\n sixteen hundreds. Tell me if I\u0027m getting any of this wrong.\"\\n\\n He gave her a cold glance.\\n\\n \"You see, we have our sources. And I seem to remember them mentioning your name, too. You were\\n\\n made a vampire by Hunter... and since his own children were all daughters, you\u0027re also his heir.\"\\n\\n Quinn laughed sourly. \"Yes, well, that\u0027s an on-again, off-again thing. You might say I have a love-hate\\n\\n relationship with the Redferns. We spend most of the time wishing each other at the bottom of the Atlantic.\"\\n\\n \"Teh, vampire family infighting,\" Rashel said. \"Why is it always so hard to get along with your folks?\"\\n\\n Despite her light words, she had to focus to keep control of her breathing.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t fear. She truly wasn\u0027t scared of him. It was something like confusion. Clearly, she should be\\n\\n killing him at this moment instead of chatting\\n\\n with him. She couldn\u0027t understand why she wasn\u0027t doing it.\\n\\n The only excuse she had was that it seemed to make him even more confused and angry than it did her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve heard enough about me,\" he said, showing his teeth. \"I\u0027m your worst nightmare,\\n\\n human. I even shock other vampires. Like old Hunter... he has certain ideas about propriety. How you\\n\\n kill, and who. If he knew some of the things I do, he\u0027d fall down dead himself.\"\\n\\n Good old Hunter, Rashel thought. The stiff moral patriarch of the Redfern clan, still caught up in the\\n\\n seventeenth century. He might be a vampire, but he was definitely a New Englander.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should find a way to tell him,\" she said whimsically.\\n\\n Quinn gave her another cold look, this time tempered with respect. \"If I thought you could find him, I\u0027d worry.\"\\n\\n Rashel was suddenly struck by something. \"You know, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard anyone say your\\n\\n first name. I mean, I presume you have one.\"\\n\\n He blinked. Then, as if he were surprised himself, he said, \"John.\"\\n\\n \"John Quinn. John.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t invite you to call me it.\"\\n\\n \"All right, whatever.\" She said it absently, deep in thought. John Quinn. Such a normal name, a Boston\\n\\n name. The name of a real person. It made\\n\\n her think of him as a person, instead of as Quinn the dreadful.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Rashel said, and then she asked him something she\u0027d never asked a Night Person before. She\\n\\n said, \"Did you want Hunter Redfern to make you a vampire?\"\\n\\n There was a long pause. Then Quinn said expressionlessly, \"As a matter of fact, I wanted to kill him for\\n\\n it.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" I\u0027d want to do the same, Rashel thought. She didn\u0027t mean to ask any more questions, but she\\n\\n found herself saying, \"Then why did he do it? I mean, why pick you?\"\\n\\n Another pause. Just when she was sure he wouldn\u0027t answer, he said, \"I was-I wanted to marry one of\\n\\n his daughters. Her name was Dove.\"\\n\\n \"You wanted to marry a vampire?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know she was a vampire!\" This time Quinn\u0027s voice was quick and impatient. \"Hunter Redfern\\n\\n was accepted in Charlestown. Granted, a few people said his wife had been a witch, but in those days\\n\\n people said that if you smiled in church.\"\\n\\n \"So he just lived there and nobody knew,\" Rashel said.\\n\\n \"Most people accepted him.\" A faint mocking smile curved Quinn\u0027s lips. \"My own father accepted him,\\n\\n and he was the minister.\"\\n\\n Despite herself, Rashel was fascinated. \"And you had to be a vampire to marry her? Dove, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t get to marry her,\" Quinn said tonelessly. He seemed as surprised as she was that he was telling\\n\\n her these things. But he went on, seeming to speak almost to himself. \"Hunter wanted me to marry one of\\n\\n his other daughters. I said I\u0027d rather marry a pig. Garnet-that\u0027s the oldest-was about as interesting as a\\n\\n stick of wood. And Lily, the middle one, was evil. I could see that in her eyes. I only wanted Dove.\"\\n\\n \"And you told him that?\" \"Of course. He agreed to it finally-and then he told me his family\u0027s secret. Well.\"\\n\\n Quinn laughed bitterly. \"He didn\u0027t tell me, actually. It was more of a demonstration. When I woke up, I\\n\\n was dead and a vampire. It was quite an experience.\"\\n\\n Rashel opened her mouth and then shut it again, trying to imagine the horror of it. Finally she just said, \"I bet.\"\\n\\n They sat for a moment in silence. Rashel had never felt so... close to a vampire. Instead of disgust and\\n\\n hatred, she felt pity. \"But what happened to Dove?\" Quinn seemed to tense all over. \"She died,\" he said\\n\\n nastily. It was clear that his confidences were over. \"How?\"\\n\\n \"None of your business!\" Rashel tilted her head and looked at him soberly. \"How, John Quinn? You\\n\\n know, there are some things you really ought to tell other people. It might help.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need a damn psychoanalyst,\" he spat. He was furious now, and there was a dark light in his\\n\\n eyes that ought to have frightened Rashel. He looked as wild as she felt sometimes, when she didn\u0027t care\\n\\n who she hurt.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t frightened. She was strangely calm, the kind of calm she felt when her breathing exercises\\n\\n made her feel one with the earth and absolutely sure of her path.\\n\\n \"Look, Quinn-\"\\n\\n \"I really think you\u0027d better kill me now,\" he said tightly. \"Unless you\u0027re too stupid or too scared. This\\n\\n wood won\u0027t hold forever, you know. And when I get out, I\u0027m going to use that sword on you.\"\\n\\n Startled, Rashel looked down at Vicky\u0027s handcuffs. They were bent. Not the oak, of course-it was the\\n\\n metal hinges that were coming apart. Soon he\u0027d have enough room to slip them off.\\n\\n He was very strong, even for a vampire.\\n\\n And then, with the same odd calm, she realized what she was going to do.\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s a good idea,\" she said. \"Keep bending them. I can say that\u0027s how you got out.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n Rashel got up and searched for a steel knife to cut the cords on his feet. \"I\u0027m letting you go, John Quinn,\" she said.\\n\\n He paused in his wrenching of the handcuffs. \"You\u0027re insane,\" he said, as if he\u0027d just discovered this.\\n\\n \"You may be right.\" Rashel found the knife and slit through the bast cords.\\n\\n He gave the handcuffs a twist. \"If,\" he said deliberately, \"you think that because I was a human once, I\\n\\n have any pity on them, you are very, very wrong. I hate humans more than I hate the Redferns.\" \"Why?\"\\n\\n He bared his teeth. \"No, thank you. I don\u0027t have to explain anything to you. Just take my word for it.\"\\n\\n She believed him. He looked as angry and as dangerous as an animal in a trap. \"All right,\" she said,\\n\\n stepping back and putting her hand on the hilt of her bokken. \"Take your best shot. But remember, I beat\\n\\n you once. I was the one who knocked you out.\"\\n\\n He blinked. Then he shook his head in disbelief. \"You little idiot,\" he said. \"I wasn\u0027t paying attention. I\\n\\n thought you were another of those jerks falling over their own feet. And I wasn\u0027t even fighting them\\n\\n seriously.\" He sat up in one fluid motion that showed the strength he had, and the control of his own body.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have a chance,\" he said softly, turning those dark eyes on her. Now that he wasn\u0027t looking\\n\\n into the flashlight, his pupils were huge. \"You\u0027re dead already.\"\\n\\n Rashel had a sinking feeling that was telling her the same thing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m faster than any human,\" the soft voice went on. \"I\u0027m stronger than any human. I can see better in the\\n\\n dark. And I\u0027m much, much nastier.\"\\n\\n Panic exploded inside Rashel.\\n\\n All at once, she believed him absolutely. She couldn\u0027t seem to get her breath, and a void had opened in\\n\\n her stomach. She lost any vestige of her previous calm.\\n\\n He\u0027s right-you were an idiot, she told herself wildly. You had every chance to stop him and you blew it.\\n\\n And why? Because you were sorry for him? Sorry for a deranged monster who\u0027s going to tear you limb\\n\\n from limb now? Anyone as stupid as that deserves what they get.\\n\\n She felt as if she were falling, unable to get hold of anything....\\n\\n And then suddenly she did seem to catch something. Something that she clung to desperately, trying to\\n\\n resist the fear that wanted to suck her into darkness.\\n\\n You couldn\u0027t have done anything else.\\n\\n It was the little voice in her mind, being helpful for once. And, strangely, Rashel knew it was true. She\\n\\n couldn\u0027t have killed him when he was tied up and helpless, not without becoming a monster herself. And\\n\\n after hearing his story, she couldn\u0027t have ignored the pity she felt.\\n\\n I\u0027m probably going to die now, she thought. And I\u0027m still scared. But I\u0027d do it over again. It was right.\\n\\n She hung on to that as she let the last seconds tick away, the last window of opportunity to stake him\\n\\n while the cuffs still held. She knew they were ticking away, and she knew Quinn knew.\\n\\n \"What a shame to rip your throat out,\" he said.\\n\\n Rashel held her ground.\\n\\n Quinn gave the handcuffs a final wrench, and the metal hinges squealed. Then the stocks clattered onto\\n\\n the concrete and he stood up, free. Rashel couldn\u0027t see his face anymore; it was above the reach of the\\n\\n flashlight.\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said evenly.\\n\\n Rashel whispered, \"Well.\"\\n\\n They stood facing each other.\\n\\n Rashel was waiting for the tiny involuntary body movements that would give away which direction he\\n\\n was going to lunge. But he was more still than any enemy she\u0027d ever seen. He kept his tension inside,\\n\\n ready to explode only when he directed it. His control seemed to be complete.\\n\\n He\u0027s got zanshin, she thought.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re very good,\" she said softly.\\n\\n \"Thanks. So are you.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"But it isn\u0027t going to matter in the end.\"\\n\\n Rashel started to say, \"We\u0027ll see\"-and he lunged.\\n\\n She had an instant\u0027s warning. A barely perceptible movement of his leg told her he was going to spring to\\n\\n his right, her left. Her body reacted without her direction, moving smoothly... and she didn\u0027t realize until\\n\\n she was doing it that she wasn\u0027t using the sword.\\n\\n She had stepped forward, inside his attack, and deflected it with a mirror palm block, striking the inner\\n\\n side of his arm with her left arm. Hitting the nerves to try and numb the limb.\\n\\n But not cutting him. She realized with a dizzy sense of horror that she didn\u0027t want to use the sword on him.\\n\\n \"You are going to die, idiot,\" he told her, and for an instant she wasn\u0027t sure if it was him saying it or the\\n\\n voice in her head.\\n\\n She tried to push him away. All she could think was that she needed time, time to get her survival\\n\\n reflexes back. She shoved at him--and then her bare hand brushed his, and something happened that was completely beyond her experience.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-5.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) \\n Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
