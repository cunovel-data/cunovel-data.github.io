But Rashel planned to fight anyway.\n And then she noticed something wrong.\n The vampires should have caught it first. Then-senses were sharper. But their senses were turned\n inward, focused on the victims in front of them. Rashel was the only one whose senses were turned\n outward, alert to everything but focused on nothing.\n There was a smell that was wrong and a sound. The smell was sharp, stinging, and close by. The sound\n was soft, distant, but recognizable.\n Gasoline. She could smell gasoline. And she could hear a faint dull roar that sounded like the fireplace in\n the gathering room-but was coming from somewhere else in the house.\n It didn\u0027t make sense. She didn\u0027t understand. But she believed it.\n \"Quinn, get ready to run,\" she said, a gasp on a soft breath. Something was about to happen.\n No, we have to fight-\n His thought to her broke off. Rashel turned to look at the doorway.\n Hunter Redfern had moved into the gathering room-but there was someone in the hall. Then the\n someone stepped forward and Rashel could see her face.\n Nyala was smiling brilliantly. Her small queenly head was high and her dark eyes were flashing. She was\n holding a red gasoline can in one hand and a liter of grapefruit juice in the other. The bottle was almost\n full of liquid and had a burning rag stuffed in the top.\n Gas. Gas from the pump on the wharf, Rashel thought. A Generation-X Molotov cocktail.\n \"It\u0027s all over the house,\" Nyala said, and her voice was lilting. \"Gallons and gallons. All over the rooms\n and the doors.\"\n But she shouldn\u0027t be hanging on to it, Rashel thought. That bottle is going to explode.\n \"You see, I am a real vampire hunter, Rashel. I figure this way, we get rid of them all at once.\"\n And the house is already burning....\n Behind the carved screen on the right side of the room, ruddy light was flickering, growing. The faint roar\n that had disturbed Rashel was louder now. Closer.\n And everything\u0027s wood, Rashel thought. Wood paneling, wood floors. Frame house. A deathtrap for vampires.\n \"Get her,\" Hunter Redfern said. But none of the vampires charged toward Nyala with her\n about-to-explode bottle of death and her can of fire accelerant. In fact, they were backing away, moving\n to the perimeter of the room.\n Hunter spun to face Nyala directly. You need to put that down, he began in telepathic tones of absolute\n authority-at the same time Rashel shouted, \"Nyala, no-\"\n The sound of telepathy seemed to set something off in Nyala. Flashing a dazzling savage smile, she\n smashed the grapefruit juice bottle at his feet.\n With almost the same motion, she threw the gasoline can, too. It was flying in a graceful arc toward the\n fireplace, spinning, spilling liquid, and vampires were scattering to try to get out of the way.\n And then everything was exploding-or maybe erupting was a better word. It was as if a dragon had\n breathed suddenly into the room, sending a roaring gale of fire through it.\n But Rashel didn\u0027t have time to watch-she and Quinn were both diving. Quinn was diving for the floor\n past Nyala, trying to drag Rashel with him. Rashel was diving for Timmy.\n She didn\u0027t know why. She didn\u0027t think about it consciously. She simply had to do it.\n She hit Timmy with the entire force of her body and knocked him to the floor. She covered him as the\n fire erupted behind her. Then she scrambled to her knees, her arm locked around his chest.\n Everything was noise and heat and confusion. Vampires were yelling at each other, running, shoving each\n other. The ones who\u0027d been splattered with gas were on fire, trying to put it out, getting in one another\u0027s way.\n \"Come on!\" Quinn said, pulling Rashel up. \"I know a way outside.\"\n Rashel looked for Nyala. She didn\u0027t see her. As Quinn dragged her into the hall, she saw dark smoke\n come billowing from the dining-room area. The hall was bathed in reddish light.\n \"Come on!\"\n Quinn was pulling her across the hall, through the smoke. Into a room that was full of orange flames.\n \"Quinn-\"\n Timmy was kicking and struggling in Rashel\u0027s arms. Yelling at her. She kept her grip on him.\n And she went with Quinn. She had to trust him. He knew the house.\n She hadn\u0027t realized how frightening fire was, though. It was like a beast with hot shriveling breath. It\n seemed alive and it seemed to want to get her, roaring out at her from unexpected places.\n And it spread so fast. Rashel would never have believed it could move so quickly through a house, even\n a house soaked with gasoline. In a matter of minutes the building had become an inferno. Everywhere\n she looked, there was fire, smoke, and a horrifying reflection of flames.\n They were on the other side of the room now, and Quinn was kicking at a door. His sleeve was on fire.\n Rashel twisted her hand out of his and beat at it to put it out. She almost lost hold of Timmy.\n Then the door was swinging outward and cool air was rushing in and the fire was roaring like a crazy\n thing to meet it. She was simply running, in panic, her only thought to hold on to Timmy and to stay with Quinn.\n They were out. But she smelled burning. And now Quinn was grabbing her, rolling her over and over on\n the sandy unpaved road. Rashel realized, dimly, that her clothes were on fire in back.\n Quinn stopped rolling her. Rashel sat up, tried to glance at her own back, then looked for Timmy.\n He was crouched on the road, staring at the house. Rashel could see flames coming out of the windows.\n Smoke was pouring upward and everything seemed as bright as daylight beneath it.\n \"Are you all right?\" Quinn said urgently. He was looking her over.\n Rashel\u0027s whole body was washed with adrenaline and her heart was pounding insanely. But she couldn\u0027t\n take her eyes off the house.\n She stumbled to her feet. \"Nyala\u0027s in there! I have to get her.\"\n Quinn looked at her as if she were raving. Rashel just shook her head and started helplessly toward the\n house. She didn\u0027t want to go anywhere near it.\n She knew the fire wanted her dead. But she couldn\u0027t leave Nyala in there to burn.\n Then Quinn was shoving her roughly back. \"You stay here. I\u0027ll get her.\"\n \"No! I have to-\"\n \"You have to watch Timmy! Look, he\u0027s getting away!\"\n Rashel whirled. She didn\u0027t have any clear idea of where Timmy might be getting away to-but he was on\n his feet and moving. Toward the house, then away from it. She grabbed for him again. When she turned\n back toward Quinn, Quinn was gone.\n No-there he was, darting into the house. Timmy was screaming again, kicking in her arms.\n \"I hate you!\" he shouted. \"Let go of me! Why did you take me out?\"\n Rashel stared at the house. Quinn was inside now. In that holocaust of flame. And he\u0027d gone because of\n her, to save her from going herself.\n Please, she thought suddenly and distinctly. Please don\u0027t let him die.\n The flames were roaring higher. The night was brilliant with them. Fire was raining in little burning bits\n from the sky, and Rashel\u0027s nose and eyes stung. She knew she should get farther back, but she couldn\u0027t.\n She had to watch for Quinn.\n \"Why? I hate you! Why did you take me out?\"\n Rashel looked at the strange little creature in her arms, the one that was biting and kicking as if it wanted\n to go back into the burning house. She\n didn\u0027t know what Timmy had become-some weird combination of child, adult, and animal, apparently.\n And she didn\u0027t know what kind of future he could possibly have. But she did know, now, why she\u0027d\n brought him out.\n She looked at the childish face, the angry eyes full of hate. \"Because my mom told me to take care of\n you,\" she whispered.\n And then she was crying. She was holding him and sobbing. Timmy didn\u0027t try to hold her back, but he\n didn\u0027t bite her anymore either.\n Still sobbing, Rashel looked over his head toward the house. Everything was burning. And Quinn was\n still inside....\n Then she saw a figure silhouetted against the flames. Two figures. One holding the other, half carrying it.\n \"Quinn!\"\n He was running toward her, supporting Nyala. They were both covered with soot. Nyala was swaying,\n laughing, her eyes huge and distant.\n Rashel threw her arms around both of them. The relief that washed over her was almost more painful\n than the fear. Her legs literally felt as if they had no bones-she was going to collapse at any second. She\n was tottering.\n \"You\u0027re alive,\" she whispered into Quinn\u0027s charred collar. \"And you got her.\" She could feel Quinn\u0027s arm\n around her, holding hard. Nothing else seemed to matter.\n But now Quinn was taking his arm away, pushing her along the road. \"Come on! We\u0027ve got to get to the\n wharf before they do.\"\n In a flash, Rashel understood. She got a new grip on Timmy and turned to run toward the hiking path.\n Her knees were shaking, but she found she could make them move.\n They lurched down the path in the wild grass, Quinn supporting Nyala, she carrying Timmy. Rashel\n didn\u0027t know how many vampires had made it out of the burning house-she hadn\u0027t seen any- but she knew\n that any who did would head for the dock.\n Where she and Annelise had disabled the boats.\n But as the wharf came into view, Rashel saw something that hadn\u0027t been there when she left it. There\n was a yacht in the harbor, swinging at anchor.\n \"It\u0027s Hunter\u0027s,\" Quinn said. \"Hurry!\"\n They were flying down the hill, staggering onto the wharf. Rashel saw no sign of the werewolf she\u0027d tied\n up earlier, but she saw something else new. An inflatable red dinghy was tied to the pier.\n \"Quick! You get in first.\"\n Rashel put Timmy down and got in. Quinn lifted Timmy into her arms, then put Nyala in. Nyala was\n staring around her now, laughing in spurts, then stopping to breathe hard. Rashel put her free arm around\n her as Quinn climbed in the dinghy.\n Every second, Rashel was expecting to see Hunter Redfern appear, blackened and smoldering, with his\n arms outstretched like some vengeful demon.\n And then the tiny motor was purring and they were moving away from the wharf. They were leaving it\n behind. They were on the ocean, the cool dark ocean, freeing themselves from land and danger.\n Rashel watched as the yacht got bigger and bigger. They were close to it now. They were there.\n \"Come on. We can climb up the swimming ladder. Come on, fast,\" Quinn said. He was reaching for her,\n his face unfamiliar in a mask of soot, his eyes intense. Absolutely focused, absolutely determined.\n Thank God he knows what to do on a boat. I wouldn\u0027t. She let Quinn help her up the ladder, then\n helped Timmy and Nyala. Nyala had stopped laughing entirely now. She was simply gasping, looking\n bewildered.\n \"What happened? What-?\" She stared toward the cliffs where orange flame was shooting into the sky. \"I\n did that. Did I do that?\"\n Quinn had pulled up the anchor. He was heading for the cockpit. Timmy was crying.\n Kneeling on the deck, Rashel held Nyala. Nyala\u0027s eyelashes were burned to crisp curls. There was white\n ash on the ends. Her mouth was trembling and her body shook as if she were having convulsions.\n \"I had to do it,\" she got out in a thick voice. \"You know I had to, Rashel.\"\n Timmy sobbed on. A motor roared to life. All at once they were moving swiftly and the island with its\n burning torch was falling behind.\n \"I had to,\" Nyala said in a choked voice. \"I had to. I had to.\"\n Rashel leaned to rest her head on Nyala\u0027s hair. Wind was whipping around her as they raced away. She\n held the tiny vampire in one arm and the trembling human girl in the other. And she watched the fire get\n smaller and smaller until it looked like a star on the ocean.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-16.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: \n The Chosen (Night World Book 5) \n Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
