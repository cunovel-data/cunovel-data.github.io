{"id":88709,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Well?\" Daphne said. \"I think it\u0027s the slave trade.\" And, Rashel thought, I think I was right-this is something big. The Night World slave trade had been banned a long time ago-back in medieval days, if she remembered the stories correctly. The Council apparently had decided that kidnapping humans and selling them to Night People for food or amusement was just too dangerous. But it sounded as if Quinn might be reviving it, probably without the Council\u0027s permission. How very enterprising of him. I was right about killing him, too, Rashel thought. There\u0027s no choice now. He\u0027s as bad as I imagined- and worse. Daphne was goggling. \"They were going to make me a slave?\" she almost yelled. \"Sh.\" Rashel glanced at the man behind the doughnut counter. \"I think so. Well-a slave and a sort of perpetual food supply if you were sold to vampires. Probably just dinner if you were going to werewolves.\" Daphne\u0027s lips repeated werewolves silently. But Rashel was speaking again before she could ask about it. \"Look, Daphne-did you get any idea about where you might be going? You said they mentioned a boat. But a boat to where? What city?\" \"I don\u0027t know. They never talked about any city. They just said the boat was ready... and something about an aunt-clave.\" She pronounced it ont-clave. \"The girl said, \u0027When we get to the aunt-clave...\u0027\" Daphne broke off as Rashel grabbed her wrist. \"An enclave,\" Rashel whispered. Thin chills of excitement were running through her. \"They were talking about an enclave.\" Daphne nodded, looking alarmed. \"I guess.\" This was big. This was... bigger than big. It was incredible. A vampire enclave. The kidnapped girls were being taken to one of the hidden enclaves, one of the secret strongholds no vampire hunter had ever managed to penetrate. No human had even discovered the location of one. If I could get there... if I could get in... She could learn enough to destroy a whole town of vampires. Wipe an enclave off the face of the earth. She knew she could. \"Uh, Rashel? You\u0027re hurting me.\" \"Sorry.\" Rashel let go of Daphne\u0027s arm. \"Now, listen,\" she said fiercely. \"I saved your life, right? I mean, they were going to do terrible things to you. So you owe me, right?\" \"Yeah, sure; sure, I owe you.\" Daphne made pacifying motions with her hands. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yes. I\u0027m fine. But I need your help. I want you to tell me everything about that club. Everything I need to get in-and get chosen.\" Daphne stared at her. \"I\u0027m sorry; you\u0027re crazy.\" \"No, no. I know what I\u0027m doing. As long as they don\u0027t know I\u0027m a vampire hunter, it\u0027ll be okay. I have to get to that enclave.\" Daphne slowly shook her blond head. \"What, you\u0027re going to, like, slay them all? By yourself? Can\u0027t we just tell the police?\" \"Not all by myself. I could take a couple of other vampire hunters to help me. And as for the police...\" Rashel stopped and sighed. \"Okay. I guess there are some things I should explain. Then maybe you\u0027ll understand better.\" She raised her eyes and looked at Daphne steadily. \"First, I should tell you about the Night World. Look, even before you met those vampires, didn\u0027t you ever have the feeling that there was something eerie going on, right alongside our world and all mixed up in it?\" She made it as simple as she could, and tried to answer Daphne\u0027s questions patiently. And at last, Daphne sat back, looking sick and more frightened than Rashel had seen her yet. \"They\u0027re all over,\" Daphne said, as if she still didn\u0027t believe it. \"In the police departments. In the government. And nobody\u0027s ever been able to do anything about them.\" \"The only people who\u0027ve had any success are the ones who work secretly, in small groups or alone. We stay hidden. We\u0027re very careful. And we weed them out, one by one. That\u0027s what it means to be a vampire hunter.\" She leaned forward. \"Now do you see why it\u0027s so important for me to get to that enclave? It\u0027s a chance to get at a whole bunch of them all at once, to wipe out one of their hiding places. Not to mention stopping the slave trade. Don\u0027t you think it should be stopped?\" Daphne opened her mouth, shut it again. \"Okay,\" she said finally, and sighed. \"I\u0027ll help. I can tell you what to talk about, how to act. At least what worked for me.\" She cocked her head. \"You\u0027re going to have to dress differently....\" \"I\u0027ll get a couple of other vampire hunters and we\u0027ll meet tomorrow after school. Let\u0027s say six-thirty. Right now, I\u0027m taking you home. You need to sleep.\" She waited to see if Daphne would object, but the other girl just nodded and sighed again. \"Yeah. You know, after some of the things I\u0027ve learned, home\u0027s starting to look good.\" \"Just one more thing,\" Rashel said. \"You can\u0027t tell anybody about what happened to you. Tell them anything-that you ran away, whatever-but not the truth. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"And especially don\u0027t tell anyone about me. Got it? My life may depend on it.\" \"Elliot\u0027s not here.\" The voice on the telephone was cold and as hostile as Rashel had ever heard it. \"Vicky, I need to talk to him. Or somebody. I\u0027m telling you, this is our chance to get to an enclave. The girl from the warehouse heard them talking about it.\" It was Friday afternoon and Rashel was phoning from a booth near her school. Vicky was speaking heavily. \"We staked out that street for days and didn\u0027t see anything, but you just happened to be in the right place at the right time to help a girl escape.\" \"Yes. I already told you.\" \"Well, that was convenient, wasn\u0027t it?\" Rashel gripped the handset more tightly. \"What do you mean?\" \"Just that it would be a very dangerous thing, going to a vampire enclave. And that a person would have to really trust whoever was giving them the information about it. You\u0027d have to be sure it wasn\u0027t a trap.\" Rashel stared at the phone buttons, controlling her breathing. \"I see.\" \"Yes, well, you don\u0027t have much credibility around here anymore. Not since letting that vampire get away. And this sounds like just the sort of thing you\u0027d do if you were in on it with them.\" Great, Rashel thought. I\u0027ve managed to convince her that I really am a vampire sympathizer. Aloud she said, \"Is that what Nyala is telling everybody? That I\u0027m working with the Night World?\" \"I don\u0027t know what Nyala is doing.\" Vicky sounded waspish and a little uneasy. \"I haven\u0027t seen her since Tuesday and nobody answers at her house.\" Rashel tried to make her voice calm and reasonable. \"Will you at least tell Elliot what I\u0027m doing? Then he can call me if he wants to.\" \"Don\u0027t hold your breath,\" Vicky said, and hung up. Great. Terrific. Rashel replaced the handset wondering if she wasn\u0027t supposed to hold her breath until Elliot called, or until Vicky passed on the message. One thing was clear: she couldn\u0027t count on any help from the Lancers. Or any other vampire hunters. Nyala could be spreading any kind of rumors, and Rashel didn\u0027t dare even call another group. There was no choice. She\u0027d have to do it alone. That night she went to Daphne\u0027s house. \"Well, she\u0027s grounded,\" Mrs. Childs said at the door. She was a small woman with a baby in one hand, a Pampers in the other, and a toddler clutching her leg. \"But I guess you can go upstairs.\" Upstairs, Daphne had to chase a younger sister out of the bedroom before Rashel could sit down. \"You see, I don\u0027t even have a room of my own,\" she said. \"And you\u0027re grounded. But you\u0027re alive,\" Rashel said, and raised her eyebrows. \"Hi.\" \"Oh. Hi.\" Daphne looked embarrassed. Then she smiled, sitting cross-legged on her bed. \"You\u0027re wearing normal clothes.\" Rashel glanced down at her sweater and jeans. \"Yeah, the ninja outfit\u0027s just my career uniform.\" Daphne grinned. \"Well, you\u0027re still going to have to look different if you\u0027re going to get into the club. Should we start now, or do you want to wait for the others?\" Rashel stared at a row of perfume bottles on the dresser across the room. \"There aren\u0027t going to be any others.\" \"But I thought you said...\" \"Look. It\u0027s hard to explain, but I\u0027ve had a little problem with the vampire hunters around here. So I\u0027m doing it without them. It\u0027s no problem. We can start now.\" \"Well...\" Daphne pursed her lips. She looked different from the disheveled wild creature Rashel had rescued from the street last night. Her blond hair was soft and fluffy, her cornflower blue eyes were large and innocent, her face was round and sweet. She was fashionably dressed and she seemed relaxed, in her own element in this normal teenager\u0027s room. It was Rashel who felt out of place. \"Well... do you want to just take along a friend or something?\" Daphne asked. \"I don\u0027t have a friend,\" Rashel said flatly. \"And I don\u0027t want one. Friends are people to worry about, they\u0027re baggage. I don\u0027t like baggage.\" Daphne blinked slowly. \"But at school...\" \"I don\u0027t stay at schools more than one year at a time. I live with foster families, and I usually get myself sent to a new city every year. That way I stay ahead of the vampires. Look, this isn\u0027t about me, okay? What I want to know-\" \"But...\" Daphne was staring at the mirror. Rashel followed her gaze to see that the reflecting surface was almost completely covered by pictures. Pictures of Daphne with guys, Daphne with other girls. Daphne counted her friends in droves, apparently. \"But doesn\u0027t that get lonely?\" \"No, it doesn\u0027t get lonely,\" Rashel said through her teeth. She found herself getting rough with the lacy little throw pillow on her lap. \"I like being on my own. Now are we done with the press conference?\" Looking hurt, Daphne nodded. \"Okay. I talked with some people at school and everything at the dub is going on the same as usual-except that Quinn hasn\u0027t been there since Sunday. Ivan and the girl were there Tuesday and Wednesday, but not Quinn.\" \"Oh, really?\" That was interesting. Rashel had known from the beginning that her greatest problem was going to be Quinn. The other two vampires hadn\u0027t seen her-she didn\u0027t think they even realized that Daphne had run off with a vampire hunter last night. But Quinn had spoken to her. Had been... very close to her. Still, what could he have seen in that cellar, even with his vampire vision? Not her face. Not even her hair. Her ninja outfit covered her from neck to wrist to ankle. All he could possibly know was that she was tall. If she changed her voice and kept her eyes down, he shouldn\u0027t be able to recognize her. But it would be easier still if he weren\u0027t there in the first place, and Rashel could try her act on Ivan. \"That reminds me,\" she said. \"Ivan and the girl- are their little groups into death, too?\" Daphne nodded. \"Everybody in the whole place is, basically. It\u0027s that kind of place.\" A perfect place for vampires, in other words. Rashel wondered briefly if the Night People owned the dub or if some obliging humans had just constructed the ideal habitat for them. She\u0027d have to check into that. \"Actually,\" Daphne was saying, a little shyly, \"I\u0027ve got a poem here for you. I thought you could say you wrote it. It would sort of prove you were into the same thing as the other girls.\" Rashel took the piece of notebook paper and read: There\u0027s warmth in ice; there\u0027s cooling peace in fire, And midnight light to show us all the way. The dancing flame becomes a funeral pyre; The Dark was more enticing than the Day. She looked up at Daphne sharply. \"You wrote this before you knew about the Night World?\" Daphne nodded. \"It\u0027s the kind of thing Quinn liked. He used to say he was the darkness and the silence and things like that.\" Rashel wished she had Quinn right there in the room, along with a large stake. These young girls were like moths to his flame, and he was taking advantage of their innocence. He wasn\u0027t even pretending to be harmless; instead he was encouraging them to love their own destruction. Making them think it was their \"About your clothes,\" Daphne was going on. \"My friend Mamie is about your size and she lent me this stuff. Try it on and we\u0027ll see if it looks right.\" She tossed Rashel a bundle. Rashel unfolded it, examined it doubtfully. A few minutes later she was examining herself even more doubtfully in the mirror. She was wearing a velvety black jumpsuit which clung to her like a second skin. It was cut in a very low V in front, but the sleeves reached down in Gothic points on the backs of her hands almost to the middle finger. Around her neck was a black leather choker that looked to her like a dog collar. She said, \"I don\u0027t know...\" \"No, no, you look great. Sort of like a Betsey Johnson ultra model. Walk a little... turn around... okay, yeah. Now all we have to do is paint your fingernails black, add a little makeup, and-\" Daphne stopped and frowned. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"It\u0027s the way you walk. You walk like-well, like them, actually. Like the vampires. As if you\u0027re stalking something. And you don\u0027t ever make a noise. They\u0027re going to know you\u0027re a vampire hunter from the way you move.\" It was a good point, but Rashel didn\u0027t know what to do about it. \"Um...\" \"I\u0027ve got it,\" Daphne said brightly. \"We\u0027ll put you in heels.\" \"Oh, no,\" Rashel said. \"There is absolutely no way I\u0027m going to wear those things.\" \"But it\u0027ll be perfect, see? You won\u0027t be able to walk normally.\" \"No, and I won\u0027t be able to run, either.\" \"But you aren\u0027t going there to run. You\u0027re going to talk and dance and stuff.\" Hands on her hips, she shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know, Rashel, you really need somebody to go there with you, to help you with this stuff....\" Daphne stopped and her eyes narrowed. She stared at the mirror for a moment, then she nodded. \"Yeah. That\u0027s it. There\u0027s no other choice,\" she said, expelling her breath. She turned to face Rashel squarely. \"I\u0027ll just have to go with you myself.\" \"What?\" \"You need somebody with you; you can\u0027t do this all alone. And there\u0027s nobody better than me. I\u0027ll go with you and this time we\u0027ll both get chosen.\" Rashel sat on the bed. \"I\u0027m sorry; this time you \u0027re crazy. You\u0027re the last person the vampires would ever choose. You know all about them.\" \"But they don\u0027t know that,\" Daphne said serenely. \"I told everybody at school today that I didn\u0027t remember anything that happened from Sunday on. I had to tell them something, you know. So I said that I never got to meet Quinn; that I didn\u0027t know what happened to me, but I woke up last night alone on this street in Mission Hill.\" Rashel tried to think. Would any of the vampires believe this story? The answer surprised her. They just might. If Daphne had begun to come out of the mind control while she was in the truck... if she had jumped out and started running, only to become fully conscious a little while later.. .. Yes. It could work. The vampires would assume that she\u0027d have amnesia for the whole period she was in a trance, and maybe for a little before. It could work.... \"But it\u0027s too dangerous,\" she said. \"Even if I let you go to the club with me, I could never let you get chosen.\" \"Why not? You already said I must be resistant to their mind-control thingy, right?\" Daphne\u0027s blue eyes were sparking with energy and her cheeks were flushed. \"So that makes me perfect for the job. I can do it. I know I can help you.\" Rashel stood helplessly. Take this fluffy bunny of a girl to a vampire enclave? Let her get sold as a slave to bloodsucking monsters? Ask her to fight ruthless snakes like Quinn? \"I like to work alone,\" she said in a hard voice. Daphne folded her arms over her chest, refusing to be intimidated. \"Well, maybe it\u0027s time you tried something different. Look, I\u0027ve never met anyone like you. You\u0027re so independent, so adventurous, so--amazing. But even you can\u0027t do everything by yourself. I know I\u0027m not a vampire hunter, but I\u0027d like to be your friend. Maybe you should try trusting a friend this time.\" Her eyes met Rashel\u0027s, and at that moment she didn\u0027t look like a fluffy bunny, but like a small, confident, and intelligent young woman. \"Besides, it was me who got kidnapped,\" Daphne said, shrugging. \"Don\u0027t you think I should get to pay them back a little?\" Rashel caught herself almost grinning. She couldn\u0027t help liking this girl, or feeling a glow of warmth at her praise. But still... She drew in a careful breath and watched Daphne closely. \"And you\u0027re not scared?\" \"Of course I\u0027m scared. I\u0027d be stupid not to be. But I\u0027m not so scared I can\u0027t go.\" It was the right answer. Rashel looked around the cluttered lacy room and nodded slowly. At last she said, \"Okay, you\u0027re in. Tomorrow\u0027s Saturday. We\u0027ll do it tomorrow night.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-8.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
