She didn\u0027t dare stare directly into them for long. \"Maybe she is from another planet,\" Quinn was saying to the girl. \"Maybe she\u0027s not human. Maybe I\u0027m not, either.\" That\u0027s right, Rashel thought. Make fun of them by telling them a truth they won\u0027t believe. But, she noticed, Quinn looked more as if he didn\u0027t care what they found out than as if he were mocking them. \"Maybe she\u0027s from another world. Did you ever think of that?\" Rashel was confused again. Quinn seemed to be trying to get himself killed. He appeared to be verging on telling these girls about the Night World, and under the laws of the Night World, that was punishable by death. You\u0027re really slipping, Rashel thought. First the slave trade, now this. I thought you were supposed to be such a stickler for the law. \"There are darker dimensions,\" Quinn was confiding to the group, \"than you have ever imagined. But, you see, it\u0027s all part of life\u0027s grand design, so it\u0027s all right. Did you know\"-he put his arm around a girl\u0027s shoulders, gesturing outward as if inviting her to look at some horizon-\"that there\u0027s a certain kind of wasp that lays its eggs in the body of a caterpillar? A live caterpillar. And it stays alive, you see, while the eggs hatch and the little waspettes eat it from the inside out. Now, who do you think invented that?\" Rashel wondered if vampires could get drunk. \"That would probably be the most horrible way to die,\" Daphne chimed in, her musical voice ghoulish. \"Being eaten by insects. Or maybe being burned.\" \"It would probably depend on how fast you burned,\" Quinn said meditatively. \"A flash of fire-high enough temperature-you bum the nerves out in the first few seconds. Slow baking would be different.\" \"I\u0027m writing a poem about fire,\" Rashel said. She was surprised to find that she was annoyed because Quinn didn\u0027t really seem to have noticed her. On second thought, she should be annoyed; her plan depended on him not only noticing but choosing her. She was going to have to capture his attention. \"Do you have it with you?\" Daphne was asking helpfully. \"No, but I can tell you the beginning,\" Rashel said. She braced herself to look at Quinn as she recited: \"There\u0027s warmth in ice; there\u0027s cooling peace in fire, And midnight light to show us all the way. The dancing flame becomes a funeral pyre; The Dark was more enticing than the Day.\" Quinn blinked. Then he smiled, and he looked Rashel over, dearly taking notice of the velvet jumpsuit and ending with her face. He looked everywhere... except into her eyes. \"That\u0027s right; you\u0027ve got it,\" he said with that same brittle exhilaration. \"And there\u0027s plenty of dark out there for everyone.\" Rashel\u0027s worry that he might look too deep if he met her gaze was groundless. Quinn didn\u0027t seem to be really seeing anybody here. \"There is plenty of darkness,\" Rashel said. She moved toward him, feeling strangely brave. Her instincts sensed a weakness in him, a flaw. \"It\u0027s everywhere. It\u0027s inescapable. So the only thing we can do is embrace it.\" She was standing right in front of him now, looking at his mouth. \"If we hold it dose, it won\u0027t hurt so much.\" \"Well. Exactly.\" Quinn showed his teeth, but it wasn\u0027t the manic smile. It was a grimace. He didn\u0027t look happy anymore; suddenly, for just an instant, he looked tired and sick. He was almost leaning away from Rashel. \"I came here so I could do that,\" Rashel said in a sultry voice. She was scaring herself a little. In the name of the charade, she was doing everything she could to seduce him-but it was surprisingly easy and surprisingly enjoyable. There was a sort of tingling all over her body, as if the jumpsuit had picked up a charge. \"I came to look for the darkness,\" she said. Softly. Quinn laughed abruptly. The feverish good humor came flooding back. \"And you found it,\" he said. He went on laughing and laughing, and he reached out to touch Rashel\u0027s cheek. Don\u0027t let him touch you! The thought flashed through Rashel\u0027s mind and communicated to her muscles in an instant. Without knowing how she knew, she was certain that if he touched her, it would all be over. It was skin-to-skin contact that had nearly fried every circuit in her brain before. She danced back from his fingertips and smiled teasingly, while her heart tried to pound its way out of her chest. \"This place is so crowded,\" she said throatily. \"Huh? Oh. Then why don\u0027t we schedule something more private? I could pick you up tomorrow night. Say seven o\u0027clock in the parking lot.\" Bingo. \"But Quinn.\" It was Daphne, looking aggrieved. \"You told me to meet you tomorrow.\" She trembled her chin. Quinn stared at her, and for once, Rashel could read his face easily. He was thinking that anybody that stupid deserved it. \"Well, you can both come,\" he said expansively. \"Why not? The more the merrier.\" He walked away laughing and laughing. Rashel watched him go, resisting an impulse to shake her head. She\u0027d done it; she\u0027d passed the last test and been chosen. So why was her heart still pounding? She glanced out of the side of her eye at Daphne. \"Well, I don\u0027t know about anybody else, but I\u0027ve had enough excitement for tonight.\" She went to get her coat, with the rest of Quinn\u0027s coterie glaring jealously after her. She had one enjoyable experience on the way out. Ivan, still slouching, tried to stop her at the door. \"Shelly, hey. I thought we were going to get to know each other better.\" Rashel didn\u0027t need him anymore; she had her invitation. \"I\u0027d rather get to know a head louse,\" she said in her sweet chatty voice, and she stepped on his foot hard with her high heel. In the car, she waited a full twenty minutes, watching the front of the club, before Daphne joined her. \"Sorry, but I didn\u0027t want anybody to think we were leaving together.\" \"You did a great job,\" Rashel said, driving away. \"You even managed to get both of us invited to meet Quinn together-that was dangerous, but it worked. The only thing that surprised me is that he invited us in front of everybody. Is that how he did it before?\" \"No. Not at all. Last time, he sort of whispered it to me when nobody was around. But, you know, nothing was normal tonight. I mean, he usually asks new girls questions-I guess to figure out if they have families who\u0027ll miss them. And he isn\u0027t usually that-that...\" \"Manic?\" \"Yeah. I wonder what\u0027s going on with him?\" Rashel pressed her lips together and stared straight ahead through the windshield. \"You sure you want to go through with this?\" It was Sunday night and they were nearing the parking lot of the Crypt. \"I\u0027ve told you and told you,\" Daphne said. \"I\u0027m ready. I can do it.\" \"Okay. But, listen, if there\u0027s any trouble, I want you to run. Run away from the club and don\u0027t look back for me. All right?\" Daphne nodded. At Rashel\u0027s suggestion, she was wearing something more sensible tonight: black pants heavy enough to provide some warmth, a dark sweater, and shoes she could run in. Rashel was dressed the same way, except that she was wearing high boots. The knife was in one. \"You go first,\" Rashel said, parking a street away from the club. \"I\u0027ll come in a minute.\" She watched Daphne walk away, hoping she wasn\u0027t going to get this little blond bunny killed. She herself was the danger. Quinn was going to use mind control on them to get them to go to the warehouse quietly. And Rashel wasn\u0027t sure what would happen when he did it. Just don\u0027t let him touch you, she told herself. You can carry it off as long as he doesn\u0027t touch you. Five minutes later, she started toward the Crypt. Quinn was in the dark parking lot, standing by a silvery-gray Lexus. As Rashel reached the car, she saw the pale blob of Daphne\u0027s face through the window. \"I almost thought you weren\u0027t coming.\" There was now a sort of savagery mixed in with Quinn\u0027s lunatic good humor. As if he was angry she wasn\u0027t smart enough to save herself. \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t miss this for the world.\" Rashel kept her eyes on the car. She wanted to get this over with. \"Are we going somewhere?\" There was that tiny hesitation that seemed to come every time she spoke to him, as if it were taking him a minute to focus. Or as if he were trying to figure something out, she thought nervously. Then he answered smoothly, \"Oh, right, get in.\" Rashel got in. She glanced once at Daphne in the back seat. Daphne said, \"What\u0027s up?\" in a chirpy voice laced with feminine rivalry. Good girl. Quinn was getting in the driver\u0027s side. Once the door was shut, he turned the engine on to run the heater. The windows immediately began to fog. Rashel sat in a state of continuing mind, ready for the unexpected at any moment. Only the unexpected didn\u0027t come. Nothing came. Quinn was just sitting there in the driver\u0027s seat. Watching her. With a sudden void in her stomach that threatened her zanshin, Rashel realized that it was too dark. Too familiar. They were sitting here together in silence, so close, visible to each other only in silhouette, just as they had in the cellar. She could almost feel Quinn\u0027s confusion as he tried to figure out what was bothering him. And Rashel was afraid to say anything, afraid that her chirpiest voice wouldn\u0027t be a good-enough disguise. The horrible feeling of connection was mounting, like some giant green wave looming over them both. In a moment it would break, and Quinn would say, \"I know you,\" and switch on the light to see the face without the veil. Rashel\u0027s fingers edged toward her knife. Then, through the electric buzzing in her ears, she heard Daphne say, \"You know, I just love this car. I bet it goes really fast, too. This is all so exciting-I\u0027m just so glad I got here this time. Not like last week.\" She went on, blathering easily, while Rashel sank back lightheaded with relief. The connection was broken; Quinn was now looking at his instrument panel as if trying to escape the chatter. And now Daphne was talking about how exciting it was to ride in the dark. Smart, smart girl. Quinn had to interrupt her to say, \"So, you two girls want to surrender to the darkness?\" He said it as if he were asking if they wanted to order pizza. \"Yes,\" Rashel said. \"Oh, yes,\" Daphne said. \"It\u0027s just like we always say. I think that would be just the most seriously cool-\" Quinn made a gesture at her as if to say, \"For God\u0027s sake, shut up.\" Not a rough gesture. It was more like an exasperated choir director trying to get through to some soprano who wouldn\u0027t stop at the end of the measure. Stop here. And Daphne shut up.\u0027 Like that. As if he\u0027d turned off a switch in her. Rashel twisted slightly to look at the backseat and saw that Daphne had slumped to one side, body limp, her breathing peaceful. Oh, God, Rashel thought. She was used to the kind of mind control other vampires had tried on her. The persuasive, whispery-voice-in-the-head type. And when Quinn hadn\u0027t tried to use that, or to call for help in the cellar, she\u0027d assumed he was low on telepathy. Now she knew the truth. He packed a telepathic punch like a pile driver. No, like a karate blow: swift, precise, and deadly. He turned to look at her, a dark shape against a lighter darkness. Rashel tried to brace herself. \"And the rest is silence,\" Quinn said, and gestured at her. Rashel fell into a void. She woke up as she was being carried into the warehouse. She had enough presence of mind not to open her eyes or make any other sign that she was conscious. It was Quinn carrying her; she could tell even with her eyes shut. When he dumped her on a mattress, she deliberately fell so that her head was turned away from him and her hair was over her face. She had a moment\u0027s fear that he was going to discover the knife in her boot when he shackled her ankles. But he didn\u0027t even roll up her pant leg. He seemed to be doing everything as quickly as possible, without really paying attention. Rashel heard the shackle snap shut. She kept perfectly still. She lay and listened as he brought Daphne in and chained her. Then she heard voices close by and the sound of other footsteps. \"Put that one down here-what happened to her purse?\" That was Lily. \"It\u0027s still in the car.\" Ivan. \"Okay, bring it in with the other one. I\u0027ll do her feet.\" Thump of a body hitting a mattress. Footsteps going away. The metallic clink of chains. Then a sigh from Lily. Rashel could imagine her straightening up and looking around in satisfaction. \"Well, that\u0027s it. Ivan\u0027s got number twenty-four in the car. I guess we\u0027re going to have one very happy client.\" \"Joy,\" Quinn said flatly. Twenty-four? One client? \"I\u0027ll leave a message that everything\u0027s going to be ready for the big day.\" \"Do that.\" \"You\u0027re awfully moody, you know. It\u0027s not just me who\u0027s noticed it.\" A pause, and Rashel imagined Quinn giving one of his black looks. \"I was just thinking it was ironic. I turned down a job as a slave trader once. That was before. Do you remember before, Lily? When we lived in Charlestown and your sister Dove was still alive. A captain from Marblehead asked if I wanted to ship out to Guinea for some human cargo. Black gold, I think he called it. As I remember, I hit him on the nose. And Fight-the-Good-fight-for-Faith Johnson reported me for brawling.\" \"Quinn, what\u0027s wrong with you?\" \"Just reminiscing about the old days in the sunlight. Of course, you wouldn\u0027t know about that, would you? You\u0027re lamia; you were born this way. Technically, I suppose, you were born dead.\" \"And technically, I suppose, you\u0027re going peculiar. My father always said it would happen.\" \"Yes, and I wonder what your father would think about all this? His daughter selling humans for money. And to such a client, and for such a reason-\" At that moment, while Rashel was listening desperately, hanging on every word, heavy footsteps interrupted. Ivan had returned. Quinn broke off, and he and Lily remained silent as another body thumped on a bed. Rashel cursed mentally. What client? What reason? She\u0027d supposed the girls were being sold as regular house slaves or food supplies. But clearly that wasn\u0027t the case. And then something happened that drove thoughts of the future right out of her mind. She heard footsteps next to her bed, and she was aware of someone leaning close. Not Quinn, the smell was wrong. Ivan. A rough hand grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. Another arm slid under her waist, lifting her Panic shot through Rashel, and she tried to push it away. She forced herself to stay limp, eyes shut, arms dangling passively. I ought to have been prepared for this. She\u0027d realized from the beginning that playing her part might include allowing herself to get bitten. To feel vampire teeth on her throat, to allow them to spill her blood. But it bad never happened to her before, and it took every ounce of her will to keep from fighting. She was scared. Her arched throat felt exposed and vulnerable, and she could feel a pulse beating in it wildly. \"What are you doing?\" Quinn\u0027s voice was sharp as the crack of glacier ice. Rashel felt Ivan go still. \"I\u0027ve got something to settle with this girl. She\u0027s a smartass.\" \"Take your hands off her. Before I knock you through the wall.\" \"Quinn-\" Lily said. Quinn\u0027s voice was painfully distinct. \"Drop her. Now.\" Ivan dropped Rashel. \"He\u0027s right,\" Lily said coolly. \"They\u0027re not for you, Ivan, and they have to be in perfect shape.\" Ivan muttered something sullen and Rashel heard footsteps moving away. She lay and listened to her heart slowly calming. \"I\u0027m going to get some sleep,\" Quinn said, sounding flat and dull. \"See you Tuesday,\" lily said. Tuesday, Rashel thought. Great. It\u0027s going to be a very long two days. They were the most boring two days of her life. She got to know every corner of the small glass-windowed office. The windows were a problem, since she was never absolutely sure if Lily or Ivan were outside one of them, standing in the warehouse proper and looking through. She listened carefully for the warehouse doors, froze instantly at any suspicious sound, and trusted to luck. Daphne woke up Monday morning. Rashel had her neck twisted sideways and was staring through the office glass up at the one tiny window set high in the warehouse wall. Just as it turned gray with dawn, Daphne sat up and screamed. \"Sh! It\u0027s all right! You\u0027re here in the warehouse with me.\" \"Rashel?\" \"Yeah. We made it. And I\u0027m glad you\u0027re awake.\" \"Are we alone?\" \"More or less,\" Rashel said. \"There are two other girls, but they\u0027re both hypnotized. You\u0027ll see when it gets lighter.\" Daphne let out her breath. \"Wow... we did it. That\u0027s great. So how come I\u0027m so completely and utterly terrified?\" \"Because you\u0027re a smart girl,\" Rashel said grimly. \"Just wait until Tuesday when they take us out.\" \"Take us out where?\" \"That\u0027s the question.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-10.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
