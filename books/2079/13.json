{"id":88714,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Rashel knew she had to stop the guard before he could make a sound. The vampires\u0027 mansion was on\n the farther cliffs, overlooking open sea rather than the harbor, and the music ought to help drown outside\n noises-but the greatest danger was still that they would be heard before the girls could get away.\n She launched herself at the werewolf, throwing a front snap kick to his chest. She could hear the air\n whoosh out as he fell backward. Good. No breath for howling. She landed with both knees on top of him.\n \"This is silver,\" she hissed, pressing the blade against his throat. \"Don\u0027t make a noise or I\u0027ll use it.\"\n He glared at her. He had shaggy hair and eyes that were already half-animal.\n \"Is there anybody on the boats?\" When he didn\u0027t answer, she pressed the silver knife harder. \"Is there?\"\n He snarled a breathless \"No.\" His teeth were turning, too, spiking and lengthening.\n \"Don\u0027t change-\" Rashel began, but at that moment he decided to throw her off. He heaved once,\n violently.\n A snap of her wrist would have plunged the silver blade into his throat even as she fell. Instead Rashel\n rolled backward in a somersault, tucking in her head and ending up on her right knee. Then, as the\n werewolf jumped at her, she slammed the sheathed knife upward against his jaw.\n He fell back unconscious.\n Too bad, I wanted to ask him about the client. Rashel looked shoreward, to see that Daphne, Annelise,\n and Nyala were on the pier with her. They were each holding a rock or a piece of wood broken from the\n jagged pilings of the wharf.\n They were going to help me, Rashel thought. She felt oddly warmed by it.\n \"Okay,\" she said rapidly. \"Annelise and Keiko, with me. Everybody else, stay. Daphne, keep watch.\"\n In a matter of minutes she and the boating girls had checked the boats and found two with features they\n thought they could handle... and with fuel. Anne-lise had removed a couple of crucial engine pieces out\n of the others.\n \"Took out the impellers and the solenoids,\" she told Rashel mysteriously, holding out a grimy hand.\n \"Good. Let\u0027s set them adrift. Everybody else, get yourself on a boat. Find a place to sit fast and sit\n down.\" Rashel moved to the back of the group where Fayth had her arms around a couple of the girls\n who looked scared of setting out on the dark ocean. \"Come on, people.\" She meant to herd them in front\n of her like chickens.\n That was when it happened.\n Rashel had an instant\u0027s warning-the faint crunch of sand on rock behind her. And then something hit her\n with incredible force in the middle of the back. It knocked her down and sent her knife flying.\n Worse, it sent her mind reeling in shock. She hadn\u0027t been prepared. That instant\u0027s warning hadn\u0027t been\n enough-because she had already lost zanshin.\n She no longer had the gift of continuing mind. She had lost her single purpose. In the old days she\u0027d been\n fixed on one thing-to kill the Night People. There had been no hesitation, no confusion.\n But now... she\u0027d already faltered twice tonight, knocking the werewolves unconscious instead of killing\n them. She was confused, uncertain. And, as a result, unprepared.\n And now I\u0027m dead, she thought. Her numbed mind was desperately trying to recover and come up with\n a strategy.\n But there was a wild snarling in her ear and a trail of hot pain down her back. Animal claws. There was\n a wolf on top of her.\n Rudi had gotten loose.\n Rashel gathered herself and bucked to throw the wolf off. He slipped and she tried to roll out from under\n him, arms up to keep her throat protected. The werewolf was too heavy-and too angry. He scrambled\n over her rolling body like a lumberjack on a log. His snarling muzzle kept darting for her throat in quick\n lunges. Rashel could see his bushy coat standing on end.\n She felt fire across her ribs-his claws had torn through her shirt. She ignored it. Her one thought was to\n keep him away from her throat. Keeping an elbow up, she reached for the knife with her other hand.\n No good. She hadn\u0027t rolled far enough. Her fingertips just missed the hilt.\n And Rudi the wolf was right in her face. All she could see were sharp wet teeth, black gums, and blazing\n yellow eyes. Her face was misted with hot canine breath.\n Every snap of those jaws made a hollow glunk. Rashel only had one option left-to block each lunge as it\n came. But she couldn\u0027t keep that up forever. She was already tiring.\n It\u0027s over, she thought. The girls who might have helped her-Daphne and Nyala and Annelise were at the\n far end of the wharf or on the boats. The other girls were undoubtedly too scared even to try. Rashel was\n alone, and she was going to die very soon. My own stupid fault, she thought dimly. Her arms were\n shaking and bloodied. She was getting weaker fast. And the wolf knew.\n Even as she thought it, she missed a block.\n Her arm slipped sideways. Her throat was exposed. In slow motion she saw the jaws of the wolf\n opening wide, driving toward her. She saw the triumph in those yellow eyes. She knew, with a curious\n sense of resignation, that the next thing she would feel was teeth ripping through her flesh. The oldest way\n to die in the world.\n I\u0027m sorry, Daphne, she thought. I\u0027m sorry, Nyala. Please go and be safe.\n And then everything seemed to freeze.\n The wolf stopped in midlunge, head jerking backward. Its eyes were wide and fixed. Its jaws were open\n but not moving. It looked as if it might howl.\n But it didn\u0027t. It collapsed in a hot quivering heap on top of Rashel, legs stiff. Rashel scrambled out from\n under it automatically.\n And saw her knife sticking out of the base of its skull.\n Quinn was standing above it.\n \"Are you all right?\"\n He was breathing quickly, but he looked calm. Moonlight shone on his black hair.\n The entire world was huge and quivering and oddly bright. Rashel still felt as if she were moving in slow\n motion.\n She stared at Quinn, then looked toward the wharf.\n Girls were scattered all over, as if frozen in the\n middle of running in different directions. Some were on the decks of the two remaining boats. Some\n were heading toward her. Daphne and Nyala were only fifteen feet away, but they were both staring at\n Quinn and seemed riveted in place. Nyala\u0027s expression was one of horror, hate-and recognition.\n Waves hissed softly against the dock.\n Think. Now think, girl, Rashel told herself. She was in a state of the strangest and most expanded\n consciousness she\u0027d ever felt. Her hands were icy cold and she seemed to be floating-but her mind was\n clear.\n Everything depended on how she handled the next few minutes.\n \"Why did you do that?\" she asked Quinn softly. At the same time she shot Daphne the fastest and the\n most intense look of her life. It meant Go now. She willed Daphne to understand.\n \"You just lost a guard,\" she went on, getting up slowly.\n Keep his eyes on you. Keep moving. Make him talk.\n \"Not a very good one,\" Quinn said, looking with fastidious disgust at the heap of fur.\n Go, Daphne, run, Rashel thought. She knew the girls still had a chance. There were no other vampires\n coming down the path. That meant that Rudi had either been too angry to give a general alarm or too\n scared. That was one good thing about werewolves-they acted on impulse.\n Quinn was the danger now.\n \"Why not a good one?\" she asked. \"Because he damaged the merchandise?\" She lifted her torn shirt\n away from her ribs.\n Quinn threw back his head and laughed. Something jerked in Rashel\u0027s chest, but she used the moment to\n change her position. She was right by the wolf now, with her left hand at the exact level of the knife.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Quinn said. A wild and bitter smile still played around his lips. \"He was presumptuous.\n You almost surrendered to the wrong darkness there, Shelly. By the way, where\u0027d you get a silver\n knife?\"\n He doesn\u0027t know who I am, Rashel thought. She felt both relief and a strange underlying grief. He still\n thought she was some girl from the club- maybe a vampire hunter, but not the vampire hunter. The one\n he\u0027d admitted was good.\n So he\u0027s unprepared. He\u0027s off his guard.\n If I can kill him with one stroke, before he calls to the other vampires, the girls may get away.\n She glanced at the wharf again, deliberately, hoping to draw his gaze. But he didn\u0027t look behind him, and\n Daphne and the other stupid girls weren\u0027t leaving.\n Refusing to go without her. Idiots!\n Now or never, Rashel thought.\n \"Well, anyway,\" she said, \"I think you saved my life. Thank you.\"\n Keeping her eyes down, she held out her hand.\n her right hand. Quinn looked surprised, then reached out automatically.\n With one smooth motion, like a snake uncoiling, Rashel attacked.\n Her right hand drove past his hand and clamped on his wrist. Her left hand plunged down to grab the\n knife. Her fingers closed on the hilt and pulled- and the sheath with its attached silver blade stayed in the\n werewolf\u0027s neck.\n Just as she\u0027d planned. The knife itself came free, the real knife, the one made of wood.\n And then Quinn tried to throw her and her body responded automatically. She was moving without\n conscious direction, anticipating his attacks and blocking them even as he started to make them. It\n transformed the fight into a dance. Faster than thought, graceful as a lioness, she countered every move\n he made.\n Zanshin to the max.\n She ended up straddling him with her knife at his throat.\n Now. Fast. End it.\n She didn\u0027t move.\n You have to, she told herself. Quick, before he calls the others. Before he knocks you out telepathically.\n He can do it, you know that.\n Then why isn\u0027t he trying?\n Quinn lay still, with the point of the wooden knife in the hollow of his throat, just where his dark collar\n parted. His throat was pale in the moonlight and his hair was black against the sand.\n Footsteps sounded behind Rashel. She heard rapid light breathing.\n \"Daphne, take the boats and go now. Leave me here. Do you understand?\" Rashel spoke every word\n distinctly.\n \"But Rashel-\"\n \"Do it now!\" Rashel put a force she hadn\u0027t known she had behind the words. She heard the quick intake\n of Daphne\u0027s breath, then footsteps scampering off.\n All the while, she hadn\u0027t taken her eyes off Quinn.\n Like everything else, the green-black blade of her knife was touched with moonlight. It seemed to\n shimmer almost liquidly. Lignum vitae, the Wood of Life. It would be death for him. One thrust would put\n it through his throat. The next would stop his heart.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Rashel whispered.\n She was. She was truly sorry that this had to be done. But there was no way out. It was for Nyala, for\n all the girls he\u0027d kidnapped and hunted and lured. It was to keep girls like them safe for the future.\n \"You\u0027re a hunter,\" Rashel said softly, trying for steadiness. \"So am I. We both understand. This is the\n way it goes. It\u0027s kill or be killed. It all comes down to that in the end.\" She paused to breathe.\n \"Do you understand?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"If I don\u0027t stop you, you\u0027ll be a danger forever.\n And I can\u0027t let that happen. I can\u0027t let you hurt anyone else.\" She was aware that she was shaking her\n head slightly in her attempt to explain to him. Her lungs ached and there were tears in her eyes. \"I can\u0027t.\"\n Quinn didn\u0027t speak. His eyes were black and bottomless. His hair was slightly mussed on his forehead,\n but he didn\u0027t show any other sign of just having been in a fight.\n He\u0027s not going to struggle, Rashel realized.\n Then make it quick and merciful. No need for him to feel the pain of wood through his throat. She\n switched her grip on the knife, raising it over his chest. Holding it with both hands, poised above his\n heart. One swift downward stroke and it would be over.\n For the first time since she had killed a Night Person, she didn\u0027t say what she always said. She wasn\u0027t the\n Cat right now; this wasn\u0027t revenge for her. It was necessity.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered, and shut her eyes.\n He whispered, \"This kitten has claws.\"\n Rashel\u0027s muscles locked.\n Her eyes opened.\n \"Go on,\" Quinn said. \"Do it. You should have done it the first time.\" His gaze was as steady as Fayth\u0027s.\n She could see moonlight in his eyes.\n He didn\u0027t look wild, or bitter, or mocking. He only looked serious and a little tired.\n \"I should have realized it before-that you were the one in the cellar. I knew there was something\n about you. I just couldn\u0027t figure out what. At least now I\u0027ve seen your face.\"\n Rashel\u0027s arms wouldn\u0027t come down.\n What was wrong with her? Her resolve was draining away. Her whole body was weak. She felt herself\n begin to tremble, and realized to her horror she couldn\u0027t stop it.\n \"Everything you said was true,\" he said. \"This is how it has to end.\"\n \"Yes.\" Something had swollen in Rashel\u0027s throat and it hurt.\n \"The only other possibility is that I kill you. Better this way than that.\" He looked exhausted suddenly-or\n sick. He turned his head and shut his eyes.\n \"Yes,\" Rashel said numbly. He believed that?\n \"Besides, now that I have seen your face, I can\u0027t stand the sight of myself in your eyes. I know what you\n think of me.\"\n Rashel\u0027s arms dropped.\n But limply. The blade pointed upward, between her own wrists. She sat there with her knuckles on his\n chest and stared at a scraggly wild raspberry bush growing out of the cliff.\n She had failed Nyala, and Nyala\u0027s sister, and countless other people. Other humans. When it really\n counted, she was letting them all down.\n \"I can\u0027t kill you,\" she whispered. \"God help me, I can\u0027t.\"\n He shook his head once, eyes still shut. She was open to attack, but he didn\u0027t do anything.\n Then he looked at her. \"I told you before. You\u0027re an idiot.\"\n Rashel hit him under the jaw the way she\u0027d hit the guard. The hilt of her dagger caught him squarely. He\n didn\u0027t move to avoid the blow.\n It knocked him out cold.\n Rashel wiped her cheeks and got up, looking around for something to tie him with. Her whole life was\n torn to pieces, falling around her. She didn\u0027t understand anything. All she could do was try to finish what\n she\u0027d come here for.\n Action, that was what she needed. Thought could wait. It would have to wait.\n Then she glanced at the wharf.\n She couldn\u0027t believe it. It seemed as if at least a week had passed since she yelled at Daphne, and they\n were all still here.\n The boats were here, the girls were here, and Daphne was running toward her.\n Rashel strode to meet her. She grabbed Daphne by the shoulders and shook hard.\n \"Get-out-of-here! Do you understand? What do I have to do, throw you in the water?\"\n Daphne\u0027s eyes were huge and blue. Her blond hair flew like thistledown with the shaking. When Rashel\n stopped, she gasped, \"But you can come with us now!\"\n \"No, I can\u0027t! I still have things to do.\"\n \"Like what?\" Then Daphne\u0027s eyes darted to the cliff. She stared at Rashel. \"You\u0027re going after them?\n You\u0027re crazy!\" Looking frightened, she grabbed Rashel\u0027s hands on her shoulders. \"Rashel, there are\n supposed to be eight of them, right? Plus Lily and Ivan and who knows what else! You really think you\n can kill them all? What, are they all just going to line up?\"\n \"No. I don\u0027t know. But I don\u0027t need to kill them all. If I can get the guy who set this up, the client, it will\n be worth it.\"\n Daphne was shaking her head, in tears. \"It won\u0027t be worth it! Not if they kill you-which they will. You\u0027re\n already hurt-\"\n \"It\u0027ll be worth it if I can stop him from doing this again,\" Rashel said quietly. She couldn\u0027t yell anymore.\n She didn\u0027t have the strength. Her voice was quenched, but she held Daphne\u0027s eyes. \"Now get somebody\n to throw me some rope or something to tie these guys with. And then leave. No, give me five minutes to\n get to the top of the cliff. Six minutes. That way maybe I can surprise them before they realize you\u0027re\n gone.\"\n Daphne was crying steadily now. Before she could say anything, Rashel went on. \"Daphne, any minute\n now they could realize that. Someone\u0027s bound to check the cellar before midnight. Every second we\n stand here could make the difference. Please, please, don\u0027t fight me anymore.\"\n Daphne opened her mouth, then shut it. Her eyes were desolate. \"Please try to take care of yourself,\"\n she whispered. She let go of Rashel\u0027s shoulders and hugged her hard. \"We all know you\u0027re doing it for\n us. I\u0027m proud to be your friend.\"\n Then she turned and ran, herding the others ^^ toward the boats.\n A moment later she threw Rashel two pieces of line. Rashel tied up Quinn first, then the werewolf.\n \"Six minutes,\" she said to Daphne. Daphne nodded, trying not to cry.\n Rashel wouldn\u0027t say goodbye. She hated that. Even though she knew perfectly well that she was never\n going to see Daphne again.\n Without looking back, she loped up the hiking trail.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-13.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: \n The Chosen (Night World Book 5) \n Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
