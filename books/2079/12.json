{"id":88713,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"The voice was shrill, almost hysterical. Unbalanced, Rashel thought dazedly, looking around. The sound of her secret being yelled out loud stunned her. But just for an instant. The next moment she was moving swiftly between the rows of girls, looking for... \"Nyala!\" \"I know why you\u0027re here!\" Nyala sat up tensely. She looked just as she had when Rashel had seen her last, cocoa skin, queenly head, wide haunted eyes. She was even dressed in the same dark clothes she\u0027d been wearing the night they caught Quinn. \"You\u0027re here because you were in on it all along! You pretend to be a vampire hunter-\" \"Shut up!\" Rashel said desperately. Nyala was shouting loud enough to be heard on the other side of the door. She knelt on Nyala\u0027s bed. \"I\u0027m not pretending, Nyala.\" \"Then how come you\u0027re free and we\u0027re all chained up? You\u0027re on their side! You call yourself the Cat-\" Rashel clamped a hand over her mouth. \"Listen to me,\" she hissed. Her heart was pounding. All the girls around her were staring and she expected to hear the cellar door open at any moment. \"Nyala, listen. I know you don\u0027t like me or trust me-but you\u0027ve got to stop yelling that. We may only have one chance to get out of here.\" Nyala\u0027s chest was heaving. Her eyes, the color of dark plums, stared into Rashel\u0027s. \"I am a vampire hunter,\" Rashel whispered, willing Nyala to believe it. \"I made a mistake letting that vampire go that night... I admit it. But I\u0027ve been trying ever since to put things right. I got captured on purpose so I could find out what was going on here-and now I\u0027m going to try to get all these girls free.\" She spoke slowly and distinctly, hoping Nyala could sense the truth of her words. \"But, Nyala, if the Night People find out I\u0027m a vampire hunter-much less the Cat-they are going to take me out and kill me right this minute. And then I don\u0027t think the rest of you have a chance.\" She stopped to breathe. \"I know it\u0027s hard to trust me. But please, please try. Do you think you can do that?\" A long pause. Nyala\u0027s eyes searched hers. Then, at last, Nyala nodded. Rashel took her hand off Nyala\u0027s mouth. She sat back on the bed and they stared at each other. \"Thank you,\" Rashel said. \"I\u0027m going to need your help.\" Then she shook her head. \"But how did you get here? How did you find the club?\" \"I didn\u0027t find any club. I went back to that street with the warehouses on Wednesday. I thought maybe the vampire might come back. And then-somebody grabbed me from behind.\" \"Oh, Nyala.\" Wednesday night, Rashel thought. The night Daphne saw Ivan carry in a new girl and put her on a cot. That girl was Nyala. Rashel put a hand to her head. \"Nyala-I almost saved you. I was there the next night-when Daphne fell out of the truck. Do you remember that? If I had only known...\" Nyala wasn\u0027t listening. \"Then there was this whisper in my mind, telling me to sleep. And I couldn\u0027t move-I couldn\u0027t move my arms or my legs. But I wasn\u0027t asleep. And then he carried me into a warehouse and he bit me.\" Her voice was detached, almost pleasant. But her eyes froze Rashel in place. \"He bit me in the neck and I knew I was going to die, just like my sister. I could feel the blood coming out. I wanted to scream but I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t do anything.\" She smiled oddly at Rashel. \"I\u0027ll tell you a secret. It\u0027s still there, the bite. You can\u0027t see it, but it\u0027s still there.\" She turned her head to show a smooth unblemished neck. \"Oh, God, Nyala.\" Rashel had felt awkward trying to make gestures of comfort with Daphne, but now she didn\u0027t think. She just grabbed Nyala and hugged her hard. \"Listen to me,\" she said fiercely. \"I know how you feel. I mean-no, I don\u0027t know, because it hasn\u0027t happened to me. But I\u0027m sorry. And I know how you felt when you lost your sister.\" She leaned back and looked at Nyala, almost shaking her. \"But we have to keep fighting. That\u0027s what\u0027s important right now. We can\u0027t let them win. Right?\" \"Yes...\" Nyala looked slowly around her bed, then up at Rashel. \"Yes, that\u0027s right.\" Her eyes seemed to sharpen and focus. \"I\u0027m making a plan to get out of here. And you have to stay calm and help me.\" \"Yes.\" Nyala sounded more definite this time. Then she smiled almost serenely and whispered, \"And we\u0027ll get our revenge.\" \"Yeah.\" Rashel pressed her hand. \"Somehow, we will. I promise you.\" She walked back to her cot feeling eyes on her, although nobody asked any questions. Her own eyes were stinging. What had happened to Nyala was her fault. The girl had already been on the edge, and because of Rashel, she\u0027d gotten herself caught and attacked by a vampire. And now... Now Rashel was worried about Nyala\u0027s sanity, even if they did manage to get off the island. She\u0027s right about one thing, though, Rashel thought. Revenge. It\u0027s the only way to wipe out the things that have been done to these girls. The fire in her chest was back-as if there were coals where her throat and heart ought to be. She let it harden her and burn away any stray thoughts of mercy for Quinn. Strange how she kept having thoughts of him, long after she\u0027d made the resolution to kill him. \"Is she okay?\" Daphne said worriedly. \"I remember her from the warehouse.\" \"I know.\" Rashel took the lockpick and sat on Daphne\u0027s cot. She began to work at Daphne\u0027s shackles. \"I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s okay. The vampires haven\u0027t been living in harmony with her.\" She glanced bitterly at Fayth, who just looked back gravely and steadily. \"Nobody thinks all the Night People are good,\" Fayth said. \"Or all the humans. We don\u0027t approve of violence. We want to stop it all.\" \"Well, sometimes it takes violence to stop violence,\" Rashel said shortly. Fayth didn\u0027t answer. \"But why was she calling you a cat?\" Daphne asked. Rashel could feel Fayth\u0027s gaze on her. \"The Cat. It\u0027s the name of a vampire hunter, one who\u0027s killed a lot of vampires.\" Daphne\u0027s dark blue eyes widened slightly. \"Is it you?\" Rashel sprung a lock. Somehow, with these two girls staring at her, she didn\u0027t feel quite so brash as she had a moment ago. She didn\u0027t feel terribly proud of being the Cat. Without looking up, she said, \"Yes.\" Then she glanced behind her at Fayth. Fayth said nothing. \"There\u0027s going to be more killing before this is all done,\" Rashel said. \"And I can\u0027t think of anybody who deserves it more than the vampires who brought us here. So you let me take care of that, and we won\u0027t argue about it. All right?\" She sprung the other lock on Daphne\u0027s shackles. Daphne immediately stretched her legs luxuriously, then swung them to the floor. Fayth just nodded slowly. \"All right, then. Listen. The first thing we\u0027ve got to do is get these girls organized.\" Rashel moved to work on Fayth\u0027s chains. \"You\u0027re both good talkers. I want the two of you to go around and talk to them individually. I want to know who\u0027s going to be able to help us and who\u0027s still under mind control. I want to know who\u0027s going to be a problem. And I especially want to know who has any experience with boats.\" \"Boats?\" Fayth said. \"No place on this island is safe. We have to get off. There are four boats in the harbor right now- if we can just find somebody to handle them.\" She looked from Daphne to Fayth. \"I want you to bring me back at least two sensible girls who have some chance of not sinking a powerboat. Got it?\" Daphne and Fayth glanced at each other. They nodded. \"Right, boss,\" Daphne murmured, and they started off. Rashel sat, weighing a chain in her hand and thinking. There was no need to tell Daphne-yet-that she didn\u0027t plan to ship out with the boats. Half an hour later Daphne and Fayth stood before her beaming. At least Daphne was beaming; Fayth was wearing that grave smile that was starting to drive Rashel crazy. \"Allow me to introduce Annelise,\" Daphne said, leading Rashel to a cot. \"Originally a native of Denmark. She\u0027s done the race circuit in Antigua-whatever that means. Anyway, she says she can handle a boat.\" The girl in the cot was one of the oldest there, eighteen or nineteen. She was blond, long-legged, and built like a Valkyrie. Rashel liked her at once. \"And this is Keiko over here,\" Fayth said in her simple way. \"She\u0027s young, but she says she grew up around boats.\" This one Rashel wasn\u0027t so sure about. She was tiny, with hair like black silk and a rosette mouth. She looked like a collector\u0027s doll. \"How old are you?\" \"Thirteen,\" Keiko said softly. \"But I was born on Nantucket. My parents have a Ciera Sunbridge. I think I can do what you\u0027re asking-it\u0027s just the navigation that worries me.\" \"There isn\u0027t anybody else,\" Daphne stage-whispered in Rashel\u0027s ear. \"So my advice is we trust the kid.\" \"I think the navigation will be straight west,\" Rashel said. She smiled reassuringly at Keiko. \"Anyway, even the open ocean will be safer than here.\" She gestured to Daphne and Fayth to come back to their corner. \"Okay. Good job. You\u0027re right about trusting the kid; I don\u0027t think we have any other choice. We definitely need two boats for all these girls. What else did you find out?\" \"Well, the ones that are still under mind control are the ones that came with us,\" Daphne said. \"Juanita and Missy. And the one that might cause trouble is your buddy Nyala. She\u0027s not completely hinged, if you know what I mean.\" Rashel nodded. \"The mind control may be a problem-how long did it take to wear off the others, Fayth?\" \"A day or so after they came in. But that\u0027s not the only problem, Rashel. Annelise and Keiko think they can handle the boats-but not tonight. Not until tomorrow.\" \"We can\u0027t wait until tomorrow,\" Rashel said impatiently. \"That\u0027s cutting it way too fine.\" \"I don\u0027t think we have a choice. Rashel, all these girls are tranquilized. Drugged.\" Rashel blinked. \"How-?\" She shut her eyes. \"Oh.\" \"The food,\" Fayth said, as Rashel nodded in resignation. \"I realized right off that there was something in it. I think most of the girls know-and they\u0027d rather be tranquilized than think about what\u0027s happening to them.\" Rashel rubbed her forehead wearily. No wonder the girls hadn\u0027t asked her any questions. No wonder they weren\u0027t all screaming their heads off. They were doped to the gills. \"From now on we\u0027ve got to keep them from eating,\" she said. \"They need clear heads if we\u0027re going to escape.\" She looked at Fayth. \"Okay. We wait. But that\u0027s going to make everything more dangerous. How often do they bring food in here?\" \"Twice a day. Late morning and around eight at night. And then they take us to the bathroom two by two.\" \"Who does it?\" \"Rudi. Sometimes he has another werewolf with him.\" Daphne bit her lip anxiously. \"Are we equipped for werewolves?\" Rashel smiled. Holding her knife, she pulled the decorative knob at the end of the sheath. It came off, revealing a metal blade. She reversed the knob and stuck it in the end of the sheath, so the blade stuck out like a bayonet. The hard wooden sheath itself was now a weapon. \"The blade is silver-coated steel,\" she said in satisfaction. \"We are equipped for werewolves.\" \"You see?\" Daphne said to Fayth. \"This girl thinks of everything.\" Rashel put the knife away. \"All right. Let\u0027s talk to everybody again. I want to explain my plan. When we do this tomorrow night, it\u0027s going to take cooperation and precision.\" And, she thought, a lot of luck. \"Chow time!\" Rudi walked between the rows of cots, tossing packages from a plastic bag to either side of him. He looked, Rashel thought, exactly like a trainer throwing herring to seals. She scanned the aisle behind him. No other werewolf at the door. Good. It had been a long night and a longer day. The girls were dizzy from lack of food, keyed up, and getting more tense with each untranquilized hour. A couple of them couldn\u0027t seem to shake their first impression of Rashel-which had come from Nya-la\u0027s yelling. \"Eat up, girlies. Got to keep up your strength.\" A slightly warm foil package hit Rashel\u0027s lap, another hit the mattress. Same thing as brunch-hot dogs of the kind you get at a convenience store. Smeared with mustard and drugs. The girls had been surviving on the grapefruit juice he\u0027d poured for them. As Rudi turned to throw a package to Juanita, Rashel rose smoothly from her cot. In one motion she leaped and came down right on target. \"Don\u0027t make a sound,\" she said in Rudi\u0027s ear. \"And don\u0027t even think about changing.\" She had his arm twisted behind his back and the silver knife to his throat. Rudi didn\u0027t seem to know how he\u0027d gotten there. There were hot dogs all over the floor. \"Now,\" Rashel said. \"Let\u0027s talk about jujitsu. This is what you call a proper hold. Resistance to it will cause serious pain and quite possibly a fractured joint. Are you getting this, Rudi?\" Rudi wiggled a little and Rashel exerted pressure upward on his knuckles. Rudi yelped and danced on his toes. \"Hush! What I want to know is, where is the other werewolf?\" \"Guarding the dock.\" \"Who else is on the dock?\" \"I-nobody.\" \"Is there anybody on the stairs or in the kitchen? Don\u0027t lie to me, Rudi, or I\u0027ll get annoyed.\" \"No. They\u0027re all in the gathering room.\" Rashel nodded at Daphne. Daphne jumped out of her bed. \"Remember-quick and quiet everybody,\" she said, like a cheerleader who\u0027d been promoted to drill sergeant. Rashel felt Rudi boggle as every girl in the room kicked off her covers and stood up free. \"What the-what the-\" \"Now, Rudi.\" Keeping his elbow trapped against her, Rashel exerted pressure again, moving him easily in the direction she wanted. \"You go first. You\u0027re going to unlock the top door for us.\" \"Annelise and Keiko in front,\" Daphne said. \"Missy right here. Let\u0027s go.\" \"I can\u0027t unlock it. I can\u0027t. They\u0027ll kill me,\" Rudi muttered, as Rashel moved him up the stairs. \"Rudi, look at these young women.\" Rashel swung him around so he had a good view of the prisoners behind him. They stood in one tense, dear-eyed, lightly breathing mass. \"Rudi, if you don\u0027t unlock that door, I am going to tie you up and leave you alone with them... and this silver knife. I promise, whatever the vampires do to you won\u0027t be worse.\" Rudi stared at the girls, who stared back at him. All ages, all sizes, united. \"I\u0027ll unlock the door.\" \"Good boy.\" He fumbled getting the door open. When it was done, Rashel pushed him through first, looking tensely around. If there were vampires here, she had to change tactics fast. The kitchen was empty-and music was blasting from somewhere inside the house. Rashel gave a quick savage grin. It was a lucky break she wouldn\u0027t have dared to pray for. The music might just save these girls\u0027 lives. She pulled Rudi out of the way and nodded to Daphne. Daphne stood at the head of the stairs, silently waving the girls out. Fayth led the way with the Valkyrie Annelise and the tiny Keiko behind her. The other girls hurried past, and Rashel was proud of how quiet they were. \"Now,\" she whispered, pushing Rudi back into the stairwell. \"One last question. Who\u0027s throwing the bloodfeast?\" Rudi shook his head. \"Who hired you? Who bought the slaves? Who\u0027s the client, Rudi?\" \"I don\u0027t know! I\u0027m telling you! Nobody knows who hired us. It was all done on the phone!\" Rashel hesitated. She wanted to keep questioning him-but right now the important thing was to get the girls off the island. Daphne was still waiting in the kitchen, watching Rashel. Rashel looked at her and then helplessly at Rudi\u0027s bushy brown head. She should kill him. It was the only smart thing to do, and it was what she\u0027d planned to do. He was a conspirator in the plan to brutally murder twenty-four teenage girls-and he enjoyed it. But Daphne was watching. And Fayth would give her that look if she heard Rashel had done him in. Rashel let out her breath. \"Sleep tight,\" she said, and hit Rudi on the head with the hilt of her knife. He slumped unconscious and she shut the cellar door on him. She turned quickly to Daphne. \"Let\u0027s go.\" Daphne almost skipped ahead of her. They went out the back door and picked up the hiking path. Rashel moved swiftly, loping across the beaten-down wild grass. She caught up to the string of girls. \"That\u0027s it, Missy,\" she whispered. \"Nice and quiet. Nyala, you\u0027re limping; does your leg hurt? A little faster, everybody.\" She made her way up to the front. \"Okay, Annelise and Keiko. When we get there, I\u0027ll take care of the guard. Then you know what to do.\" \"Find which boats we can handle. Destroy whatever we can on the others and set them adrift. Then each take half the girls and head west,\" Annelise said. \"Right. If you can\u0027t make it to land, do your best and then call the Coast Guard.\" \"But not right away,\" Keiko put in. \"Lots of islanders use ship-to-shore radio instead of telephones. The vampires may be monitoring it.\" Rashel squeezed her shoulder. \"Smart girl. I knew you were right for the job. And remember, if you do call the Coast Guard, don\u0027t give the right name of the boat and don\u0027t mention this island.\" It was perfectly possible that there were Night People in the Coast Guard. They were almost at the bottom of the cliff, and so far no alarms had sounded. Rashel scanned the moving group again, then became aware that Daphne was behind her. \"Everything okay?\" \"So far,\" Daphne said breathlessly. She added, \"You\u0027re good at this, you know. Encouraging them and all.\" Rashel shook her head. \"I\u0027m just trying to keep them together until they\u0027re not my problem anymore.\" Daphne smiled. \"I think that\u0027s what I just said.\" The wharf was below them, the boats bobbing quietly. The ocean was calm and glassy. Silver moonlight gave the scene a postcard look. Ye Olde Quaint Marina, Rashel thought. She loped to the front again. \"Stay behind me all of you.\" She added to Daphne, \"I\u0027ll show you what I\u0027m good at.\" A few feet of rocks and sand and she was on the wharf. Eyes on the shack, knife ready, she moved silently. She wanted to take care of the werewolf without noise, if possible. Then a dark shape came hustling out of the shack into the moonlight. It took one look at Rashel and threw back its head to howl.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-12.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
