{"id":88715,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The first person Rashel met in the mansion was Ivan. It was sheer dumb luck, the same luck that had helped keep her alive so far tonight. She slipped in the back door, the way she and the girls had gone out. Standing in the huge silent kitchen, she listened for an instant to the music that was still blasting from the inner house. Then she swiveled to check the cellar-and met Ivan the Terrible running up the stairs. He had clearly just discovered that his twenty-four valuable slave girls were missing. His blond hair was flying, his eyes were wide with alarm, his mouth was twisted. He had the taser in one hand and a bunch of plastic handcuffs-the kind police use on rioters-in the other. When Rashel suddenly appeared on the stairway, his eyes flew open even wider. His mouth opened in astonishment-and then Rashel\u0027s foot impacted with his forehead. The snap kick knocked him backward, and he tumbled down the stairs to hit the wooden door below. Rashel leaped after him, making it to the bottom only a second after he did. But he was already out. \"What are these? Were you supposed to take some girls up?\" She kicked at the plastic handcuffs. Ivan the Unconscious didn\u0027t answer. She glanced at her watch. Only a quarter to nine. Maybe he\u0027d been taking the girls to get washed or something. It seemed too early to start the feast. Running noiselessly back up the stairs, she quietly closed the door. Now she had to follow the music. She needed to see where the vampires were, how they were situated, how she could best get at them. She wondered where Lily was. The kitchen opened into a grand dining room with an enormous built-in sideboard. It had undoubtedly been made to accommodate whole suckling pigs or something, but Rashel had a dreadful vision of a girl lying on that coffinlike mahogany shelf, hands tied behind her, while vampire after vampire stopped by to have a snack. She pushed the idea out of her mind and moved silently across the floorboards. The dining room led to a hall, and it was from the end of the hallway that music was coming. Rashel slipped into the dimly lit hall like a shadow, moving closer and closer to the doors there. The last door was the only one that showed light. That one, she thought. Before she could get near it, a figure blocked the light. Instantly Rashel darted through the nearest doorway. She held her breath, standing in the darkened room, watching the hall. If only one or two vampires came out, she could pick them off. But nobody came out and she realized it must have just been someone passing in front of the light. At the same moment she realized that the music was very loud. This wasn\u0027t another room-it was the same room. She was in one gigantic double parlor, with a huge wooden screen breaking it up into two separate spaces. The screen was solid, but carved into a lacy pattern that let flickering light through. Rashel thrust her knife in her waistband, then crept to the screen and applied her eye. A spacious room, very masculine, paneled like the dining room in mahogany and floored in cherry parquet. Glass brick windows-opaque. All Rashel\u0027s worry about somebody looking out had been for nothing. A fire burned in a massive fireplace, the light bringing out the ruddy tones in the wood. The whole room looked red and secret. And there they were. The vampires for the bloodfeast. Seven of the most powerful made vampires in the world, Fayth had said. Rashel counted heads swiftly. Yes, seven. No Lily. \"You boys don\u0027t look that scary,\" she murmured. That was one thing about made vampires. Unlike the lamia, who could stop aging-or start againwhenever they wanted, made vampires were stuck. And since the process of turning a human body into a vampire body was incredibly difficult, only a young human could survive it. Try to turn somebody over twenty into a vampire and they would burn out. Fry. Die. The result was that all made vampires were stuck as teenagers. What Rashel was looking at could have been the cast for some new TV soap about friends. Seven teenage guys, different sizes, different colors, but all Hollywood handsome, and all dressed to kill. They could have been talking and laughing about a fishing trip or a school dance... except for their eyes. That was what gave them away, Rashel thought. The eyes showed a depth no high school guy could ever have. An experience, an intelligence... and a coldness. Some of these teenagers were undoubtedly hundreds of years old, maybe thousands. All of them were absolutely deadly. Or else they wouldn\u0027t be here. They each expected to kill three innocent girls starting at midnight. These thoughts flashed through Rashel\u0027s mind in a matter of seconds. She had already decided on the best way to plunge into the room and start the attack. But one thing kept her from doing it. There were only seven vampires. And the eighth was the one she wanted. The client. The one who\u0027d hired Quinn and set up the feast. Maybe it was one of these. Maybe that tall one with the dark skin and the look of authority. Or the silvery blond with the odd smile.... No. Nobody really looks like a host. I think it\u0027s the one who\u0027s still missing. But maybe she couldn\u0027t afford to wait. They might hear the powerboats leaving over the steady pounding of the music. Maybe she should just... Something grabbed her from behind. This time she had no warning. And she wasn\u0027t surprised anymore. Her opinion of herself as a warrior had plummeted. She intended to fight, though. She went limp to loosen the grip, then reached between her own legs to grab her attacker\u0027s ankle. A jerk up would throw him off balance.... Don\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t want to have to stun you, but I will. Quinn. She recognized the mental voice, and the hand clamped across her mouth. And both the telepathy and the skin contact were having an effect on her. It wasn\u0027t like before; no lightning bolts, no explosions. But she was overwhelmed with a sense of Quinn. She seemed to feel his mind-and the feeling was one of drowning in dark chaos. A storm that seemed just as likely to kill Quinn as anyone else. He lifted her cleanly and backed out of the room with her, into the hall, then up a flight of stairs. Rashel didn\u0027t fight. She tried to clear her head and wait for an opportunity. By the time he\u0027d pulled her into an upstairs room and shut the door, she realized that there wasn\u0027t going to be an opportunity. He was just too strong, and he could stun her telepathically the instant she moved to get away. The tables had turned. There was nothing to do now but hope that she could face death as calmly as he had. At least, she thought, it would put a stop to her confusion. He let go of her and she slowly turned to look at him. What she saw sent chills between her shoulder blades. His eyes were as dark and chaotic as the clouds she\u0027d sensed in his mind. It was scarier than the cold hunger she\u0027d seen in the eyes of the seven guys downstairs. Then he smiled. A smile that shed rainbows. Rashel pressed her back against the wall and tried to brace herself. \"Give me the knife.\" She simply looked at him. He pulled it out of her waistband and tossed it on the bed. \"I don\u0027t like being knocked out,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know why, but something about it really bothers me.\" \"Quinn, just get it over with.\" \"And it took me a while to get myself untied. Every time I meet you, I seem to end up hog-tied and unconscious. It\u0027s getting monotonous.\" \"Quinn... you\u0027re a vampire. I\u0027m a vampire hunter. Do what you have to.\" \"We\u0027re also always threatening each other. Have you noticed that? Of course, everything we keep saying is true. It is kill or be killed. And you\u0027ve killed a lot of my people, Rashel the Cat.\" \"And you\u0027ve killed a lot of mine, John Quinn.\" He glanced away, looking into a middle distance. His pupils were enormous. \"Less than you might think, actually. I don\u0027t usually kill to feed. But, yes, I\u0027ve done enough. I said before, I know what you think of me.\" Rashel said nothing. She was frightened and confused and had been under strain for quite a long time. She felt that at any moment she could snap. \"We belong to two different races, races that hate each other. There\u0027s no way to get around that.\" He turned his dark eyes back on her and gave her a brilliant smile. \"Unless, of course, we change it.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I\u0027m going to make you a vampire.\" Something inside Rashel seemed to give way and fall. She felt as if her legs might collapse. He couldn\u0027t mean it, he couldn\u0027t be serious. But he was. She could tell. There was a kind of surface serenity pasted over the dark roiling clouds in his eyes. So this was how he\u0027d solved an unsolvable problem. He had snapped. Rashel whispered, \"You know you can\u0027t do that.\" \"I know I can do that. It\u0027s very simple, actually- all we have to do is exchange blood. And it\u0027s the only way.\" He took hold of her arms just above the elbow. \"Don\u0027t you understand? As long as you\u0027re human, Night World law says you have to die if I love you.\" Rashel stood stricken. Quinn had stopped short, as if he were startled himself by what he\u0027d said. Then he gave an odd laugh and shook his head. \"If I love you,\" he repeated. \"And that\u0027s the problem, of course. I do love you.\" Rashel leaned against the wall for support. She couldn\u0027t think anymore. She couldn\u0027t even breathe properly. And somewhere deep inside her there was a trembling that wouldn\u0027t stop. \"I\u0027ve loved you from that first night, Rashel the Cat. I didn\u0027t want to admit it, but it was true.\" He was still gripping her tightly by the arms, leaning close to her, but his eyes were distant, lost in the past. \"I\u0027d never met a human like you,\" he said softly, as if remembering. \"You were strong, you weren\u0027t weak and pathetic. You weren\u0027t looking for your own destruction. But you were going to let me go. Strength and compassion. And... honor. Of course I loved you.\" His dark eyes focused again. He looked at her sharply. \"I\u0027d have been crazy not to.\" Falling into darkness... Rashel had a terrifying desire to simply collapse in his arms. Give in. He was so strangely beautiful, and the power of his personality was overwhelming. And of course she loved him, too. That was suddenly excruciatingly clear. Undeniable. From the beginning he had struck a chord in her that no one else had ever touched. He was so much like her-a hunter, a fighter. But he had honor, too. However he might try to deny it or get around it, deep inside him there was still honor. And like her, he knew the dark side of life, the pain, the violence. They had both seen-and done-things that normal people wouldn\u0027t understand. She was supposed to hate him... but from the beginning she\u0027d seen herself in him. She had felt the bond, the connection between them.... Rashel shook her head. \"No!\" She had to stop thinking these things. She would not surrender to the darkness. \"You can\u0027t stop me, you know,\" Quinn said softly. \"That ought to make things easier for you. You don\u0027t even have to make a decision. It\u0027s all my fault. I\u0027m very, very bad, and I\u0027m going to make you a vampire.\" Somehow that gave Rashel her voice back. \"How can you do that-to someone you love?\" she spat. \"Because I don\u0027t want you dead! Because as long as you\u0027re human, you\u0027re going to get yourself killed!\" He put his face close to hers, their foreheads almost touching. \"I will not let you kill yourself,\" he said through his teeth. \"If you make me a vampire, I will kill myself,\" Rashel said. Her mind had cleared. However much she wanted to give in, however enticing the darkness might be, it all disappeared when she thought of how it would end. She would be a vampire. She\u0027d be driven by bloodlust to do things that would horrify her right now. And she\u0027d undoubtedly find excuses for doing them. She would become a monster. Quinn was looking shaken. She\u0027d scared him, she could see it in his eyes. \"You\u0027ll feel differently once it\u0027s done,\" he said. \"No. Listen to me, Quinn.\" She kept her eyes on his, looking deep, trying to let him see the truth of what she was saying. \"If you make me a vampire, the moment I wake up I\u0027ll stab myself with my own knife. Do you think I\u0027m not brave enough?\" \"You\u0027re too brave; that\u0027s your problem.\" He was faltering. The surface serenity was breaking up. But that wasn\u0027t really helpful, Rashel realized, because underneath it was an agony of desperate confusion. Quinn really couldn\u0027t see any other solution. Rashel couldn\u0027t see any herself-except that she didn\u0027t really expect to survive tonight. Quinn\u0027s face hardened, and she could see him pushing away doubts. \"You\u0027ll get used to it,\" he said harshly, his voice grating. \"You\u0027ll see. Let\u0027s start now,\" he added. And then he bit her. He was so fast. Unbelievably fast. He caught her jaw and tilted her head back and to the side-not roughly but with an irresistible control and precision. Then before Rashel had time to scream, she felt a hot sting. She felt teeth, vampire teeth, extended to an impossible delicacy and sharpness, pierce her flesh. This is it. This is death. Panic flooded her. But it wasn\u0027t death, of course-not yet. She wouldn\u0027t even be changed into a vampire by a single exchange of blood. No, instead it would be slow torture... days of agony... pain.... She kept waiting for the pain. Instead she felt a strange warmth and languor. Was he actually drinking her blood? All she could sense was Quinn\u0027s mouth nuzzling at her neck, his arms around her tightly. And... His mind. It happened all at once. In a sudden silent explosion, white light engulfed her. It burst around her. She was floating in it. Quinn was floating in it. It was shining around them and through them, and she could feel a connection with Quinn that made their last connection seem like a faulty telephone line. She knew him. She could see him, his soul, whatever you wanted to call it, whatever it was that made him John Quinn. They seemed to be floating together in some other space, in a naked white light that revealed everything and mercilessly lit up all the most secret places. And if anyone had asked her, Rashel would have said that would be horrible, and she would have run for her life to get away from it. But it wasn\u0027t horrible. She could see dreadful dark bits in Quinn\u0027s mind, and dreadful dark bits in hers. Tangled, thorny, scary parts, full of anger and hate. But there were so many other parts-some of them almost unused-that were beautiful and strong and whole. There was so much potential. Rainbow places that were aching to grow. Other parts that seemed to quiver with light, desperate to be awakened. We ask so little of ourselves, Rashel thought in wonder. If everybody\u0027s like this-we stunt ourselves so badly. We could be so much more.... I don\u0027t want you to be more. You \u0027re amazing enough the way you are. It was Quinn. Not even his voice, just-Quinn. His thoughts. And Rashel knew her thoughts flowed to him without her even making an effort. You know what I mean. Isn\u0027t this strange? Does this always happen with vampires? Nothing like this has ever happened to me in my life, Quinn said. What he felt was even more, and Rashel could sense it directly, in a dizzying sweet wave. There was an understanding between them that ran deeper than any words could convey. Whatever was happening to them, however they had gotten to this place, one thing was obvious. Under the white light that revealed their inner selves, it was clear that small differences like being vampire or human didn\u0027t matter. They were both just people. John Quinn and Rashel Jordan. People who were stumbling through life trying to deal with the hurt. Because there was hurt. There was pain in the landscape of Quinn\u0027s mind. Rashel sensed it without words or even images; she could feel the feelings that had scarred Quinn. Your father did something-he killed Dove? Oh, John. Oh, John, I\u0027m so sorry. I didn\u0027t know. Rainbow lights shimmered when she called him John. It was the part of him that he had repressed the most ruthlessly. The part that she could almost feel growing in her presence. No wonder you hated humans. After everything you\u0027d ken through, to have your own father want you And no wonder you hated vampires. They killed someone dose to you-your mother? And you were so young. I\u0027m... sorry. He wasn\u0027t as easy with words as she was, but here they didn\u0027t need words. She could sense his sorrow, his shame, and his fierce protectiveness. And she could sense the emotion behind his next question. Who did it? I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll probably never know. Rashel didn\u0027t want to pursue it. She didn\u0027t want to feed the dark side of Quinn; she wanted to see more of the shimmering light. She wanted to make the light grow until the dark disappeared. Rashel, that may not be possible. Quinn\u0027s thought wasn\u0027t bitter; it was serious and gentle. Tinged with infinite regret. I may not be able to become anything better- Of course you can. We all can. Rashel cut him off with absolute determination. She could feel the bone-deep cold that had set into him years ago, that he\u0027d allowed to set in. I won\u0027t let you be cold, she told him, and she went for a romp in his mind, kissing things and blowing warmth into them, thinking sunlight and comfort everywhere. Please stop; I think you\u0027re killing me. Quinn\u0027s thought was shaky-half serious and half hysterical, like the helpless gasp of somebody being tickled to death. Rashel\u0027s whole being was singing with elation. She was young-how strange that she had never really felt young until now-and she was in love and stronger than she had ever been before. She had John Quinn the vampire squirming and semi-hysterical. She was unstoppable. Anything was possible. I\u0027ll make everything be right, she told Quinn, and she was happy to see that she\u0027d driven his doubt and his sadness away, at least for the moment. Do you really want me to stop? No. Quinn sounded dazed now-and bemused. I\u0027ve decided I\u0027ll enjoy dying this way. But... Rashel couldn\u0027t follow the rest of his thought, but she felt a new coldness, something like a wind from outside. Outside. She\u0027d forgotten there was an outside. In here, in the private cocoon of their minds, there was nothing but her and Quinn. It was almost as if nothing else existed. But... There was a whole world out there. Other people. Things happening. Things Rashel had to stop.... \"Oh, God, Quinn-the vampires.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-14.html","bookId":2079,"book":{"id":2079,"title":"Night World : The Chosen (Night World #5)","description":"Storyline: The Chosen (Night World Book 5) Armed with a wooden stake, martial arts, and the will to resist a vampire’s mind control, Rachel struggles to avenge her mother’s death in The Chosen.
