{"id":70794,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"IT WAS DAWN, and the sky was a dead-looking gray, with a hard wind blowing from two directions at once. A little white piece of the moon was still showing, like a bone knife hanging in the sky. The men of the War Society were getting themselves ready to go down the sloping hill to the shrine of the shining rocks at the place where the three rivers met.\\n\\n She Who Knows stood apart, watching them from a distance, wishing she could go down there with them.\\n\\n It was always the men who got to do everything interesting, and always the same ones, the young ones full of juice. The old men like Silver Cloud and Stinking Musk Ox and Fights Like A Lion made the pronouncements and issued the orders, but it was the young ones, Tree Of Wolves and Broken Mountain and Blazing Eye and Caught Bird In Bush and three or four others, who actually did things. They were the ones who were truly alive, She Who Knows thought, envying them fiercely.\\n\\n When there was game in the plains, they were the Hunting Society. They sharpened the tips of their spears and wrapped dark strips of wolf fur around their ankles to give them speed and ferocity, and they went out and stampeded the mammoths over cliffs, or gathered around some hapless stray rhinoceros and stabbed it until it fell, or threw the rocks-with-strings at the swift reindeer in the hope of entangling their legs and bringing them down. And afterward they carried or dragged their kill back to the camp, singing and dancing triumphantly, and everyone came out to praise them and chant their names, and they were given the first pick of the newly cooked meat: the heart and the brains and the other good parts.\\n\\n And when someone had transgressed, or a chieftain had come to the end of his days and had to be sent to the next world, they became the Killing Society and donned the masks made of bearskin and brought forth the ivory club of death, and they went off with their victim out of the sight of the tribe and did what had to be done. And then solemnly returned, walking in line one by one and singing die Song of the Next World, which only the men of the Killing Society were permitted to sing.\\n\\n And when there were enemies lurking nearby, it was time for the men, these very same men, to become the War Society and paint themselves with the blue stripes across their shoulders and the red stripes around their loins, and wrap the yellow lion-mantles around their shoulders. That was what they were doing now, and She Who Knows was bitterly envious. The men were standing naked in a circle, edgily joking and laughing, while the old craftsman Mammoth Rider finished mixing the pigments. War was the only occasion on which the men of the tribe ever painted their bodies; and it had been a long time now since the last such occasion, so the pigments had to be mixed fresh. That took time. But Mammoth Rider knew how to grind the rocks and how to mix the antelope fat with the powder so that it would stick to the skin. He sat crosslegged, bending over his work. And the men of the Killing Society waited for him to be done.\\n\\n He had brought forth the tubes of bone in which the pigments were stored and he was stirring the fat into the powder in a stone bowl. And now at last the colors were ready. Mammoth Rider handed the bowl of red color to Broken Mountain and the bowl of blue color to Young Antelope, and the other men lined up to be painted.\\n\\n The laughing and joking grew even louder now. The men were frightened of what was to come: that was why they were laughing so much. The two painters used foxtail brushes to apply the color, and that in itself made them all laugh, because the brushes tickled so much. The shoulder-stripes were easy, one narrow blue one across the back, one wide one across the chest, and then a blue Goddess-dab right on the throat in the place where the hard part of the throat sticks out, and another one over the heart. It was painting the lower parts that caused all the amusement. First came a thick red stripe across the base of the belly just above the place where the man-parts are, going all the way around back and across the top of the buttocks; then a thin stripe encircling each diigh just below the man-parts; and then, what always made them laugh, the Goddess-stripe running the length of the man-organ and two more dots of red on the round parts that dangled below it. Broken Mountain put the paint down there on with a great flourish and the men made a pretense of rinding it unendurably ticklish. Or perhaps they weren\u0027t pretending.\\n\\n Go on, She Who Knows thought. Paint me also! I have no man-parts but you can put the red stripes around my loins and on the tips of my breasts, and it will be just as good when the time of batde conies. Because I am every bit as much of a warrior as any of you. Every bit as much.\\n\\n They were almost finished now. All die men were done except the two painters themselves. Now Broken\\n\\n Mountain put the lower stripes on Young Antelope and Young Antelope put the upper stripes on Broken Mountain; and then they exchanged paint-bowls, and Young Antelope put the red on Broken Mountain, and Broken Mountain put the blue on Young Antelope. And they all tied their loincloths around their waists and their lion-mantles over their shoulders and picked up their spears and they were ready to make war.\\n\\n Or almost ready. Goddess Woman had to say the war-words over them first, in front of the three bear-skulls. But even now She Who Knows could see the two younger Goddess Women setting out the skulls across the way, and Goddess Woman herself putting on the special robes that she had to wear when she administered the war-blessing.\\n\\n She Who Knows looked down the hill, toward the shrine of shining rocks at the place where the rivers met. There was no one down there.\\n\\n All this would be for nothing if the Other Ones had gone off somewhere else. Goddess Woman had reported that the footprints of the Other Ones around the shrine were fresh ones, but what did Goddess Woman know? She was no hunter. The footprints she had seen could have been three days old. The Other Ones might be far from here by now.\\n\\n All that needed to be done was to go quickly down to the shrine and perform the rites that Silver Cloud seemed to think were necessary; and then the People could turn east again-getting away from this place and heading back into the flat cold empty country where the Other Ones rarely went-and go on with their lives. If there was in fact no need of sending the War Society down there first to sniff out the territory and make sure no Other Ones were skulking near the shrine, then Silver Cloud was wasting valuable time. The year was moving along. The days were shorter now. It would be snowing every day, soon. The People needed quickly to finish what they had come here to do, and find some safe place where they could settle in during the bad months that were coming.\\n\\n But most likely Goddess Woman was right, and Other Ones uvre someplace nearby. And there would be war; and men would die, and perhaps not only men.\\n\\n Keeps The Past, coming up behind her, said practically into her ear, \"The Goddess is being very hard on us these days. We came here to worship Her; but first She takes the little boy, and then She brings us right into the midst of the Other Ones.\"\\n\\n She Who Knows shrugged. \"I see no Other Ones. We\u0027ve been here two days and nobody has seen any Other Ones.\"\\n\\n \"But they\u0027re there. Waiting for us, hidden below, ready to attack. I know that.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I dreamed it,\" said Keeps The Past. \"They were invisible, like creatures of mist, and then they became half-solid like shadows, and then they were springing up out of the earth ail around us and they began to kill us.\"\\n\\n She Who Knows laughed harshly. \"Another dark dream.\"\\n\\n \"Another?\"\\n\\n \"The night before last, Silver Cloud dreamed that he was a boy again and he went into the sea and when he came out of it he began to grow older with every step he took, until within a few moments he was withered and crooked and feeble. A dream of death, is what that was. And now you dream Other Ones waiting for us at the shrine.\"\\n\\n Keeps the Past nodded. \"And the Goddess has taken the boy Skyfire Face without giving us any sign of Her pleasure in return. We should leave this place, I think, without staying to perform any ceremonies at that shrine down there.\"\\n\\n \"But Silver Cloud says we must.\"\\n\\n \"Silver Cloud grows timid and weak with age,\" said Keeps The Past.\\n\\n She Who Knows turned furiously to the chronicler. \"Would you like to be chieftain in his place?\"\\n\\n \"Me?\" Keeps The Past smiled. \"Not I, She Who Knows. I want no part of being chieftain. If there\u0027s any woman in the world who yearns in her heart to be a chieftain, She Who Knows, I think it\u0027s you. But I have no appetite for such burdens. -Even so, I think the time may have come for Silver Cloud to put down his wand and cap and mantle.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s old and getting feeble. You can see the weariness in his eyes.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s strong and wise,\" said She Who Knows, without much conviction.\\n\\n \"You know that you are saying that which isn\u0027t true.\"\\n\\n \"Am I, Keeps The Past? Am I?\"\\n\\n \"Go easy, woman. If you hit me, I\u0027ll have you thrown down the hill.\"\\n\\n \"You called me a liar.\"\\n\\n \"I told you that you said that which isn\u0027t true.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the same thing.\"\\n\\n \"A liar who lies even to herself is no true liar, but a fool. You know and I know and Goddess Woman knows that Silver Cloud is no longer fit to be chieftain. Each of us has thought it and said it in her own way. -And when the men begin to realize that too, the Killing Society will have to do its work.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps so,\" said She Who Knows uneasily.\\n\\n \"Then why do you defend him?\"\\n\\n \"I feel sorry for him. 1 don\u0027t want him to have to die.\"\\n\\n \"How tender of you. But the chieftain knows how things are done. Do you remember the days when Black Snow was chieftain, and he fell sick with the green bile and norfring could heal him, and he stood up before us all and said his time had come? Did he hesitate even a moment? And it was the same with Tall Tree before him, Silver Cloud\u0027s father, when I was a girl. You weren\u0027t born then. Tall Tree was a great chieftain; but one day he said, I am too old, I can no longer be chieftain, and by nightfall he was dead. As must happen to Silver Cloud.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet. Not yet.\"\\n\\n Coolly, Keeps The Past said, \"Even if he leads us into disaster? Which perhaps he is doing right now. It was a mistake to come to this place: I see that now, though at first I didn\u0027t. Why are you so strong in his defense? He means nothing to you. I didn\u0027t diink you even liked him.\"\\n\\n \"If Silver Cloud dies, who will be chieftain in his place, do you think?\"\\n\\n \"Blazing Eye, I suppose.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. Blazing Eye!\" She Who Knows grinned vindictively. \"I tell you, Keeps The Past, I\u0027d rather stay with bumbling old Silver Cloud and die beneath the spears of the Other Ones than have to live another ten years with Blazing Eye as chieftain of this tribe!\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Keeps The Past. \"Aha! Now I understand. You put your own little personal resentments ahead of common sense-even ahead of life itself, She Who Knows. How absurd you are! How foolish!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to make me hit you, after all.\"\\n\\n \"But don\u0027t you see-\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said She Who Knows. \"No, I don\u0027t see at all. -But enough of this. Look, look, down there!\"\\n\\n While the two women had been talking, Goddess Woman had finished performing the War Society blessing and the men of the War Society, properly painted and outfitted, had descended the hill to take up positions around the shrine of the shining rocks. There they stood now in front of it, shoulder to shoulder, brandishing their spears and glaring defiantly in all directions.\\n\\n And there were the Other Ones, materializing out of nowhere like the creatures of mist who had turned solid in Keeps The Past\u0027s dream.\\n\\n Where had they come from? They must have been crouching in the dense bushes alongside one of the three rivers, down out of sight, perhaps hiding themselves in some magical way so that they had looked like bushes themselves until the time came for them to emerge.\\n\\n There were eight or ten of them. No, more than ten. She Who Knows tried to count them, but she used up both her hands and there were still more of them to count. There might be at least another full hand of them besides. Whereas the War Society numbered only nine warriors.\\n\\n It was going to be a massacre. Silver Cloud had sent all the young men of the tribe to their deaths.\\n\\n \"How hideous they are!\" Keeps The Past whispered harshly, clutching She Who Knows\u0027 forearm so hard that her grip was painful. \"Like monsters! Like nightmare things! When I saw them in my dream they were nothing as disgusting as this!\"\\n\\n \"They look just like themselves,\" said She Who Knows- \"That is how the Other Ones look.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve seen them before. I haven\u0027t. Foh, die flat faces of diem! Their skinny necks. Their arms, their legs -so long. Like spider legs!\"\\n\\n \"Like spiders, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Look. Look.\"\\n\\n Everyone in the tribe was clustering together now at the little overlook point above the shrine of the three rivers. All eyes were on the scene below. She Who Knows heard Silver Cloud\u0027s rough, heavy breathing nearby. A child was crying. A couple of the Mothers seemed to be crying too.\\n\\n A strange thing was happening down below. It was almost like a dance.\\n\\n The men of the War Society were still standing shoulder-to-shoulder, in a straight line in front of the shrine. They looked uneasy, but they were holding their ground, however eager they might be inside to bolt and run.\\n\\n The Other Ones had formed a line facing them, perhaps twenty paces away. They too stood shoulder to shoulder: tall strange-looking flat-faced men, holding long spears.\\n\\n But there was no attack.\\n\\n The two groups of warriors simply stood there, glaring at each other across the area of no-man\u0027s-land that separated them. Nobody moved. The men didn\u0027t even seem to be breathing. They were as still as rocks. Could it be that the Other Ones were just as frightened as the men of the War Society must be? They were supposed to be such ruthless killers, the Other Ones were. And they outnumbered the War Society men by at least one hand\u0027s worth. But nothing was happening. No one was willing to make a move.\\n\\n It was Blazing Eye who made the first attempt to break the impasse. He stepped forward one pace. A moment later everyone in the War Society line stepped forward one pace also. v\\n\\n Blazing Eye shook his spear menacingly and glared across toward the Other Ones and uttered a sound, long and low, that came floating up the hill to the watchers above:\\n\\n \"Hoooo.\"\\n\\n The Other Ones exchanged glances and frowns. They looked confused, uncertain, troubled.\\n\\n One of their men stepped forward also; and his whole line followed him. He too shook his spear.\\n\\n \"Hooooo.\"\\n\\n \"Hoooooo,\"\\n\\n \"Hooooooo.\"\\n\\n She Who Knows and Keeps The Past looked at each other in wonder. All they were doing on both sides was making foolish noises at each other down there! Was this how a battle was supposed to begin? Perhaps it was: she couldn\u0027t be sure. But it was a silly way to go about things, if it was.\\n\\n Maybe the men down there weren\u0027t sure of what they were supposed to do, either. These warriors, She Who Knows realized, had never fought against the Other Ones before, had never even encountered them until this moment. She was the only one of the tribe who had, that time when she had met the lone Other One by the icy pool. And that one time, so long ago, the Other One had turned and run from her.\\n\\n Now these Other Ones were simply standing there looking worried, and mimicking the silly noises that the men of the War Society were making. Even though the Other Ones outnumbered the men of the Killing Society and seemed to have better weapons.\\n\\n Why? Were the dreaded Other Ones a race of cowards?\\n\\n \"Hooooo.\"\\n\\n \"Hooooo.\"\\n\\n \"Hooooo.\"\\n\\n \"Hooooo,\"\\n\\n \"Listen to them,\" She Who Knows said, snickering. \"Like owls, they sound.\"\\n\\n Just then there was a litde movement down below. The entire line of War Society men had turned ever so slightly, so that it was now at a little angle from the front of the shrine. And the Other Ones had turned also at the same angle, still staying in formation, continuing to face die War Society men.\\n\\n There was more hooting. The lines moved a litde more, without actually going anywhere. Then diey moved back. Spears were raised and shaken, but were not thrown.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re afraid of each other!\" Keeps The Past said, in astonishment.\\n\\n \"Hoooo.\"\\n\\n \"Hoooo.\"\\n\\n \"We should just charge at them,\" She Who Knows muttered. \"They\u0027d turn and run in a moment!\"\\n\\n \"Hoooo.\"\\n\\n \"Hoooo.\"\\n\\n \"Like owls,\" said Keeps The Past.\\n\\n It was maddening. The stalemate could go on forever. She Who Knows was unable to take it any longer. She went across to the place where Mammoth Rider was sitting, with the two bowls of warpaint on the ground in front of him, and stripped away her robe. Mammodi Rider looked up at her, puzzled.\\n\\n \"Give me the paint,\" She Who Knows said.\\n\\n \"But you can\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"I can.\"\\n\\n She bent and quickly snatched up the bowl of blue pigment, and splattered some carelessly on each of her breasts. Then she took up die red, and drew a big triangje on her middle, across die base of her belly and up both her thighs, and one splash on the dark hair at her loins.\\n\\n Everyone was staring at her now. She didn\u0027t bother asking Mammoth Rider to put stripes of warpaint on her back; she doubted that he would do it, and she didn\u0027t want to waste time discussing it with him. It didn\u0027t matter. She wasn\u0027t planning to turn her back on any of the enemy down there.\\n\\n Other Ones! she thought fiercely. Cowards, all of them!\\n\\n Silver Cloud was coming toward her now, moving hesitantly, favoring his sore leg.\\n\\n \"What are you doing, She Who Knows?\"\\n\\n \"Getting ready to fight your war for you,\" she said. And put her robe back on and started down the hill toward the place of the shrine of the shining rocks. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ugly-little-boy/page-11.html","bookId":1746,"book":{"id":1746,"title":"The Ugly Little Boy","description":"Storyline: The Ugly Little Boy \\n by Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg \\n Asimov wrote the short story \"The Ugly Little Boy\" in 1958.
