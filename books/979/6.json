Kirk whirled and peered through the dusk, which was gathering rapidly. He saw a slightly amused pair of brown eyes, brunette hair, and a trim body dressed in chic good taste in expensive Terran clothes. Cortland stood up. \"Mrs. Sherrin ... our new Planetary Administrator, Cyril Kirk.\" She lowered herself to the ground, spreading out a small mat under her as she did so. \"Jeannette, if you don\u0027t mind.\" She folded her legs under her carefully. \"I don\u0027t mean to be disrespectful. But there\u0027s such a small number of us here, we need to be friends and stick together.\" Cortland, who had been looking away for a moment turned to them. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, someone wants to talk to me.\" Kirk nodded. \"Did I meet your husband this afternoon?\" he inquired politely, as Cortland strode off. \"No; I\u0027m a widow.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" he murmured. \"Don\u0027t be. Not for me, I mean. We\u0027d been coming to a parting of the ways for a long time. But let\u0027s not talk about that. How do you like the dancing?\" He looked at the firelit figures, whirling in the growing dusk. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sort of overwhelmed by everything. It\u0027s all so new. I\u0027ve heard so many confusing things—\" She nodded. \"If you manage to make sense out of the Nemarians, you\u0027ll make history. It\u0027s better not to worry about it too much. Immerse yourself in their gay, happy life.\" \"What do you mean?\" She gave him a sharp look. \"You\u0027ll find out what I mean. Didn\u0027t Cortland tell you?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Well, you might as well go in cold at that. Form your own conclusions as you go along. No use giving you prejudices before you start. Maybe you\u0027re the man who\u0027ll cut the Gordian knot. No use telling you it can\u0027t be done.\" \"What can\u0027t be done?\" \"We\u0027ll all be rooting for you.\" She poured herself a drink and downed it quickly. \"Great stuff, this. Makes you forget the petty annoyances of the garden-spot of the galaxy.\" She poured another. \"To Nemar,\" she said, lifting it. \"Now tell me about Terra. What\u0027s been happening back home?\" He could get nothing more out of her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3075/84934.html","bookId":979,"book":{"id":979,"title":"Birthright","description":"简介： Cyril Kirk\u0027s first sight of the planet from the spaceship did nothing to abate the anger seething within him.
