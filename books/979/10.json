She was an attractive girl, he thought idly. He wondered why he felt nothing for her, when the native girl aroused in him such an unreasonable longing. It would be a good deal more convenient to fall for Jeannette. He couldn\u0027t afford to get mixed up with his maid. Remembering her, he suddenly felt his body trembling.

With a quiet, careless pride that made him, the new ruler of her planet, awkward and insecure in the presence of his own servant? Jeannette had been jealous, he realized suddenly.
