{"id":40364,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER 19","content":"He stood there for a long time after they had left, trying to control his rage. He had tried everything he could think of. He had argued, reasoned, pleaded with them. He had raged at them, threatened them. Nothing had worked. The threats had not disturbed them. He thought of sending out an emergency beam for help. But what would he say when the ship arrived: put these people under martial law—force them to work—it\u0027s for their own good? He\u0027d like to see if they could do it, he thought. He\u0027d be betting they couldn\u0027t. He paced up and down, clenching his fists. He could have all the council members jailed, he thought. Only there weren\u0027t any jails on Nemar. Resentment burned in him. They\u0027d let him work and struggle and slave day and night—for this. He swung his fist into the wall suddenly, with all his might. The pain stung, but he felt a little better. He looked at the bruised hand, wondering what to do. He was too restless to go home and stay by himself, burning up with unspent rage; and he certainly couldn\u0027t go and sit among the natives, listening to them chatter and laugh. He decided to take a walk. He heard a rustle of leaves after he had gone a little way and saw a pair of feminine legs through the underbrush. He tried to turn aside. He didn\u0027t feel like talking to Jeannette now. But she had already seen him. \"Hello, there,\" she said, pushing aside a branch from where she was sitting. \"Are you taking a walk, too? Thought you were always sticking to the old grindstone this time of day.\" \"Hello, Jeannette.\" \"Sit down and rest for a minute. I need some company.\" He hesitated, then sat down reluctantly. \"You don\u0027t look too cheerful,\" she said, looking at him. \"Something eating you?\" \"Just this place,\" he said wearily. \"And the people.\" \"Yes, it gets you after a while, doesn\u0027t it? It\u0027s pretty hard to take.\" He leaned against a tree and tried to relax. \"It\u0027s hard to live with,\" she went on, \"the constant sense of inferiority....\" He wondered if he had heard her correctly. \"What did you say?\" \"I said, it\u0027s hard to live with.\" \"No, no. I meant the last part.\" \"The constant sense of inferiority. Is something the ma—\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I\u0027m talking about the Nemarians, naturally.\" \"You surely don\u0027t consider them superior to us!\" he said incredulously. \"Let\u0027s not fool ourselves,\" she said. \"There isn\u0027t one of them that isn\u0027t superior to every Terran here.\" He stared at her. \"Of course, we do fool ourselves. I\u0027ve been doing it a long time. Or trying to, anyway. But I\u0027ve been sitting here thinking. Among other things, about why I didn\u0027t leave on that ship you came on, as I\u0027d planned.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you?\" he asked. \"The same reason nobody else did, but Jerwyn; and he had to.\" \"Plenty of them don\u0027t like it here,\" he said. \"There\u0027s plenty of griping.\" \"Not really,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not really griping. It\u0027s just a way of making yourself feel better. Only the ones who haven\u0027t been here too long do it, and one or two others who are real old-line die-hards, like your Mr. Cortland. \"Why didn\u0027t you leave?\" \"Because this is a good deal, of course. The climate\u0027s lovely; the scenery\u0027s beautiful; life is sort of a perpetual pleasure outing. The only trouble is, you\u0027re always on the fringes. You\u0027re the kid from across the tracks.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"That wasn\u0027t the right phrase, because that implies snobbishness, and they\u0027re not snobbish. But they don\u0027t quite accept you. They let you hang around; they let you play with them. But you\u0027re not really one of them.\" \"Why on earth should you want to be one of them! They\u0027re just a bunch of ignorant primitives, while we come from the highest center of culture civilization has ever attained.\" \"Yes, yes, I know all that. We\u0027re very good at pushing buttons and keeping in the right traffic lanes. But let\u0027s look the facts in the face. I\u0027ve been sitting here making myself look the facts in the face. Have you ever seen one of them act mean?\" \"Well, not mean exactly, but—\" \"No, you haven\u0027t. They can get plenty angry, but they don\u0027t get mean. There\u0027s a difference.\" He said nothing. \"Have you ever seen a child here tear the wings off an insect?\" She went on, not waiting for his reply. \"No, you haven\u0027t. And you won\u0027t. Have you ever seen a native with a hard, cruel face? No, again. Have you ever seen one that wasn\u0027t gentle with children?\" \"I guess not. I never thought about it.\" She turned to him with an odd tremulousness in her face, replacing her usual cynical look and slightly raised eyebrows. \"They love their children here. They really love them.\" She looked at him. \"They don\u0027t say they love them and then hit them and humiliate them because they accidentally break the vase Aunt Matilda gave the family for Christmas. Their child\u0027s happiness means more to them than any vase, than any material object. They never humiliate their children. That\u0027s why they grow up to walk like kings and queens. \"They grow up being loved,\" she said. \"They all love each other. And it isn\u0027t because they try. They don\u0027t try to be good and nice and love their fellow-men, like we do. It\u0027s just something that flows out of them. They\u0027re full of warmth inside, and it flows out. \"And something else—\" she went on. \"Have you ever caught one in a lie?\" \"No, but that doesn\u0027t mean—\" \"People like your Mr. Cortland think they\u0027re sly and deceptive because they\u0027re always courteous, and still you can\u0027t push them around. But he\u0027s wrong. They\u0027re courteous because they\u0027re sorry for us, not because they\u0027re afraid of us.\" \"Sorry for us?\" \"Yes, sorry for us. They\u0027re sorry for us because we don\u0027t know how to enjoy life, because we worry about all sorts of things that don\u0027t matter, and knock ourselves out working, and need other people to reassure us of our own worth. Because we have bad tempers and awkward bodies, and we don\u0027t have that warmth inside of us flowing out toward other people. \"Even toward us,\" she said. \"They\u0027re kind to us. They\u0027re tolerant. They want us to be happy. And they do accept us eventually. If we stay here enough years. If we change. Maybe not quite as one of them, but almost. Sometimes they even marry us.\" Kirk shook his head, trying to clear it. \"I can\u0027t think. I feel confused, I—\" \"Still thinking about our great technological achievements? We\u0027re pretty cocky about them, aren\u0027t we? We come here all set to spread enlightenment among the savages.\" She shrugged. \"They\u0027re not impressed with our magic machines. They\u0027re not selling their planet for a handful of beads. They took a good look at us and decided to try to keep what they had.\" She looked at him steadily. \"Personally, I\u0027ve decided I can do without the vidar-shows. I\u0027m going to stay and try to make the grade here. I\u0027m going to work at becoming a better human being. I\u0027m tired of being flippant and smart and sophisticated. I\u0027d like to be happy.\" She paused. \"Maybe a Nemarian will even fall in love with me eventually and marry me.\" \"You want to marry one of them!\" \"You catch on fast.\" She blinked. \"Sorry. That\u0027s not a very good beginning. It\u0027s going to take awhile to shake that flippancy.\" She caught his eyes. \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to marry Nanae?\" He didn\u0027t answer. She smiled oddly. \"Yes, I\u0027d like to marry one of them and have children like theirs.\" She hesitated. \"I said once, they spoil their children rotten. I guess they do in a way, but the children turn out fine. We Terrans just aren\u0027t used to children with a sense of their rights. These children overwhelm me.\" She lowered her eyes. \"You know how flippant I am—when I try it in their presence I feel terribly stupid. They make me aware of every affectation; their eyes are so clear—like a deer\u0027s—I feel like a fool.\" She looked at him tremulously, defensively. \"Anyway, I said that about their being spoiled, out of envy. When I first saw how their mothers held them—all that tenderness, all that love, all that warmth—I envied them with a terrible bitterness. It wasn\u0027t that I had bad parents. Just ordinary ones, trying to do their best and all that.\" \"Why do you keep talking about children all the time? After all, it\u0027s the adults who run things.\" \"The children are the adults of the future. It\u0027s the way they\u0027re brought up that makes these people what they are. You and I—all of us from Terra—we\u0027ve been brought up on a limited, scientifically regimented, controlled amount of love. These natives have something we\u0027ll never have. We\u0027ve got to work and strive for what comes as naturally to them as breathing.\" As she spoke, Kirk suddenly remembered the close-packed faces of Terrans speeding by in the opposite direction on the moving sidewalks at home—tense faces, hard faces, resigned faces, sad faces, timid faces, worried faces. Maybe one in fifty serene and self-confident, maybe one in a hundred vibrantly, joyously alive. Maybe. Probably not that many. He thought of the faces of the Nemarians. Jeannette was still talking. \"They are what human beings should be,\" she said slowly. \"Somehow they\u0027ve kept their birthright—the ability to be full of the joy of living whenever they\u0027re not in real trouble or sorrow, the ability to be happy just because they\u0027re alive. I haven\u0027t understood these people because I didn\u0027t want to understand them. I didn\u0027t want to see that they were better than I am. They\u0027re very simple, really; it\u0027s we who are complicated and devious.\" \"Why hasn\u0027t anybody ever heard of this place?\" Kirk asked. \"It\u0027s isolated,\" she said, \"and people don\u0027t leave here, once they\u0027ve seen what\u0027s here. They don\u0027t write too much, either, because by the time the spaceship arrives again, they understand. They cooperate with the authorities, who are trying to keep this place as much of a secret as possible. Publicize it, and within ten years it would be swarming with wealthy businessmen on vacation and jaded neurotics trying to get away from it all. The Nemarians would be lost in the shuffle.\" She was still a moment. \"My husband came here to get away from it all. He heard rumors of this place a long way off and traced them. I didn\u0027t want to come. I liked cities and night-clubs; I liked being surrounded by amiable, promiscuous men. He dragged me here against my will. Now he\u0027s dead, and I\u0027m caught up in his dreams. These people are irresistible; they call out to something basic and deep in you, and you respond to it whether you want to or not. You can\u0027t leave this place—unless you have to. Like you will.\" Kirk stood up abruptly. \"Jeannette, do you mind? I feel terribly confused. A lot has happened to me today. I want to walk alone awhile and think things out.\" She nodded, with a sudden look of compassion. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3075/84947.html","bookId":979,"book":{"id":979,"title":"Birthright","description":"简介： Cyril Kirk\u0027s first sight of the planet from the spaceship did nothing to abate the anger seething within him.
