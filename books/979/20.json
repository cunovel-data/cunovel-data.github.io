He needed to get it all straightened out. The sense of inferiority, she\u0027d said, the constant sense of inferiority. Let\u0027s not fool ourselves, she\u0027d said. There isn\u0027t one of them that isn\u0027t superior to every Terran here. And he\u0027d just sat there, stupefied, not denying it. Because once it was spoken, put into words, it had a certain rightness. A certain obviousness. He\u0027d known it all the time. He hadn\u0027t let himself know it, though. He\u0027d struggled against it, choking it back when it started seeping up from his unconscious. He\u0027d worked so hard and kept himself so busy and exhausted he didn\u0027t have time to think. He\u0027d thought so hard about other things he didn\u0027t have time to think about the truth. He\u0027d arrived here looking for the answer to a mystery. Thinking maybe the planet had a secret value, hoping maybe it held an explosive or new weapon that was classified as Super Top Secret, wondering if maybe it weren\u0027t really primitive. And nobody could have told him: it does have a secret value—secret because you\u0027re too blind to see it. Nobody could have told him; these people are more advanced than you are. Because advanced meant machines. Advanced didn\u0027t mean happy, loving, graceful, courageous, honest. They couldn\u0027t have told him with words if he couldn\u0027t see it with his eyes—if he couldn\u0027t see that the glowing faces of the natives held a secret worth learning. The only secret that really mattered. How to be happy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3075/84948.html","bookId":979,"book":{"id":979,"title":"Birthright","description":"简介： Cyril Kirk\u0027s first sight of the planet from the spaceship did nothing to abate the anger seething within him.
