{"id":12427,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"In the morning Jack called up the Madagascar to see if there was any message for him. It appeared that some one had telephoned him several times since the night before. No name had been left, but the telephone number was given. \n \n The number suggested nothing to Jack. He called it, and a voice strange to him answered. He asked if there was anyone there who wished to speak to Mr. Robinson, and after a pause he heard another voice, a squeaky treble. \n \n \"This Mr. Robinson? Gee! I thought I\u0027d never get hold of you!\" \n \n \"Who is it?\" \n \n \"Whitcomb. You know.\" \n \n \"Whitcomb? I don\u0027t know,\" said Jack perplexed. \n \n \"You know, your confidential agent that you gave orders to yesterday.\" \n \n A light broke on Jack. \"Sure!\" he cried. \"Didn\u0027t recognize the name.\" \n \n \"Well you never know who may be tapping the wire.\" \n \n \"Very wise precaution. What is it, Tommy—I mean Whitcomb?\" \n \n \"I got a report to make.\" \n \n \"Fire away.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t tell you over the phone. It\u0027s too important. Say, Mr. Robinson, I got what you sent me after all right.\" \n \n \"Good boy!\" \n \n \"Want me to come to the hotel?\" \n \n Jack not knowing if Bobo and Miriam would be out of the way, said \"No.\" He considered a moment. \"Meet me at Harmon Evers\u0027 shop, number — East Twenty-Ninth street. In half an hour.\" \n \n The half hour gave Jack time to get to Evers\u0027 and change his make-up. It was not yet eight o\u0027clock. \n \n Evers evinced a strong interest in Tommy when he arrived. \"Comical little fellow, isn\u0027t he?\" he said. \"That wiry, blonde hair betokens an enterprising character. These boys of the street learn to think for themselves early.\" \n \n Tommy and Jack did not discuss their business of course, until they had left the shop. Outside Jack said: \n \n \"Do you mean to say you have spotted the house where the old man lives?\" \n \n \"Not where he lives, but where he changes his clothes.\" \n \n \"Good man! Where is it?\" \n \n \"Forty-Eighth street, near Seventh avenue.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll go there,\" said Jack, and looked up and down for a taxi-cab. \"You can tell me the whole story on the way. We\u0027ll stop at the Madagascar for a gun and a pair of handcuffs in case we meet our friend.\" \n \n When they were seated in the cab Tommy began his story. \"I was thinking over everything you told me, and it seemed to me I wouldn\u0027t have a very good show to trail the old man by myself. Maybe he knew my face you see, and anyway the uniform was a give away. So I got my cousin to help me. He ain\u0027t working now. He\u0027s bigger\u0027n me. We\u0027re going partners in the detective business when we get the coin to open up an office.\" \n \n \"I described him the man I was after, and placed him acrost the street from the office, with instructions to follow me if I come up, and pick up the trail if I had to drop it.\" \n \n \"Well, about half past two yes\u0027day, old man come into the office for his package all right. Soon as I see him I slides out and waits for him outside. Say he was cagy all right. He had a hunch he was being trailed. Dodged in one door of the Knickerbocker and out again by another. In the Forty-Second street building he tried to shake me by riding in different elevators, but I stuck to him all right. Me cousin was right there too, with his tongue hanging out.\" \n \n \"He took to the Subway next. Got on an up-town local at Grand Central. I got in the next car because I thought he might reco\u0027nize me, but me cousin sits down right opposite him. Well after we left Times Square station he comes into my car, gives me a hard look, and sits down beside me. Say, me heart was going like a compressed air riveter.\" \n \n \"He says to me: \u0027Don\u0027t you work at 1118 Broadway?\u0027 and I says: \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 He says: \u0027I guess you worked for me sometimes,\u0027 and I looks at him hard and makes out to reco\u0027nize him for the first, and says: \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 He says: \u0027You carried a little package for me up to the Hotel Beanvenoo yes\u0027day.\u0027 I says: \u0027Yes, sir. The lady was out, so I brung it back.\u0027\" \n \n \"\u0027Hm!\u0027 says he, like that, and looks at me real hard for a minute, I guess. He\u0027s got blue eyes that make holes in you like bay\u0027nits. But he didn\u0027t get any change off a me. Then he says real sudden-like: \u0027Has anybody been trying to fix you?\u0027 \u0027Why no sir!\u0027 I says with a baby stare. \u0027I dunno what you mean.\u0027\" \n \n \"\u0027Where you going now?\u0027 says he. I hadda say somepin real quick. I says: \u0027I gotta deliver a letter up-town.\u0027 \u0027Where?\u0027 \u0027Seventy-Second street.\u0027 He says: \u0027Let me see it.\u0027 I says: \u0027\u0027Gainst the rules, boss.\u0027 He laughs sneery like.\" \n \n \"By this time the train was pulling into Fiftieth. \u0027Well I get out here\u0027 he says, sticking me with those eyes again. And there he left me flat. What could I do. But I look and I see me cousin is hep, so I know all ain\u0027t lost yet. As the train pulls out I see that kid foller him up the stairs.\" \n \n \"Well I chases home, and changes me clo\u0027es. I puts on the toughest rig I got. Then I went down to Mis\u0027 Harvest\u0027s store and waited \u0027round. Mis\u0027 Harvest keeps a little candy and stationery store under my house. Me cousin and me, we never plague her like the other kids does, and she lets us sort of stick around. We use her phone in our business. We had agreed if we got separated, the one who lost the trail was to go to Mis\u0027 Harvest\u0027s and wait for a call.\" \n \n \"Me cousin calls me up about four o\u0027clock. He says the old man is sitting in the Knickerbocker bar, drinking and talking to a feller, and if I hustle maybe I can git there before he leaves. Well, I meets me cousin outside the door of the bar, and he says the old man is still inside. He patrols the Broadway side, and I takes the Forty-Second street entrance, and we meet at the corner, and exchange signals. \n \n \"Bye and bye old man comes out my cousin\u0027s door, and the two of us take after him down Broadway. At Fortieth street, old man turns real sudden and grabs hold me cousin. There was a cop there. Old man says: \u0027Officer, this boy has been follerin\u0027 me all afternoon!\u0027 Cop takes a grip on me cousin; say, maybe that kid wasn\u0027t scared! Cop says: \u0027What do you want to annoy this gen\u0027leman for?\u0027 but me cousin was mum as a dummy! Cop says: \u0027Do you want to lay \u0027a complaint, sir?\u0027 Old man says: \u0027Haven\u0027t time. Just warn him, and let him go.\u0027 So the cop boots me cousin down the side street, and old man goes on down Broadway. But I was right there steppin\u0027 on his heels. He never thought of looking at me in me old clothes.\" \n \n \"Well now he thought he was clear of us all, and he didn\u0027t bother about coverin\u0027 his tracks no more. He crosses Broadway, and comes back tutter side. He only made one stop. That was in a cigar store. He telephoned from the booth. Then he led me straight to the house on 48th near 7th, an old private house it was, that\u0027s been turned into stores and offices. There was no elevator nor nothing. \n \n \"I couldn\u0027t foller him inside, so I waits acrost the street. He come out in half an hour. Say, I almost missed him then. He\u0027s a rapid change artist for fair! Had a big trust on him now——\" \n \n \"Trust?\" interrupted Jack. \n \n \"You know, corporation, bow-window——\" Tommy illustrated. \n \n \"I see, go on.\" \n \n \"But he looked twenty years younger. Real black hair now, little black moustache, white face—like a dude Eyetalian. Had a neat derby on, and black overcoat.\" \n \n \"Good God!\" cried Jack. \"Comrade Wilde! You\u0027re sure it was the same man.\" \n \n \"Certain sure! But it was a peach of a make-up. I wouldn\u0027t of got on to it, only he didn\u0027t walk like a fat man. He didn\u0027t lean back far enough to balance his load if it was bona-fide.\" \n \n \"Pretty good!\" said Jack. \"I never thought of that.\" \n \n \"Well, I took after him again, but he give me the slip at Sixth Avenue. There was a car waiting for him there—big black limousine——\" \n \n \"I know it!\" said Jack ruefully. \n \n \"He hopped it, and went off down-town. There was a taxi there too, but the shover only laughed at me, when I wanted to hire him. By the time I satisfied him I had the price, the black car was out of sight.\" \n \n \"I went back to the house on Forty-eighth. There\u0027s a lady\u0027s hat store in the basement, and a beauty parlor on the first floor. Up-stairs is mixed offices and unfurnished rooms. It\u0027s one of those old style walk-up houses that you can go in and out of, without being noticed. I made out to be looking for a Mr. Webster. By asking round I found out the old man has the third floor rear. There\u0027s no sign on the door nor nothing. The other tenants thinks it\u0027s a traveler that just keeps his samples there. None of them don\u0027t know him.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61367.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
