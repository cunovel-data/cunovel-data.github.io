{"id":12432,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37","content":"Jack was counting on the fact that the circumstances of his quarrel with Bobo would be faithfully reported to \"Mr. B.\" and that the latter would satisfy himself that he, Jack, actually boarded the steamship for British Guiana. \\n\\n \\n\\n He moved to a more modest hotel, as befitted his altered circumstances, but on Saturday morning he returned to the Madagascar and loitered in the lobby, ostentatiously bidding good-by to the acquaintances he had made there, whose demeanor, by the way, had noticeably cooled since he lost his job. He did not see Bobo again, but he had a distant glimpse of Kate passing through the lobby, a charming figure in her maid\u0027s dress with lace apron and cap, her eyes demurely cast down. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack had the satisfaction, at length, of observing that he was the object of a covert interest on the part of a well-dressed, sharp-eyed youth of much the same type as those he had formerly known in \"Mr. B.\u0027s\" service. When he was sure of this he took a taxi for the boat. Baldwin, who seemed to have a genuinely friendly feeling for him, offered to see him off, and Jack was not averse, of course, to having another witness to his actual departure. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he and Baldwin stood on the promenade deck of S.S. Covenas Jack saw the sharp-eyed one watching from the crowd on the dock. Evidently his instructions were to make sure that Jack did not escape down the gang-plank at the last moment. Stanley Larkin was safely aboard the ship, but according to pre-arrangement he and Jack gave no sign of recognition. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally the last gong sounded, Jack and Baldwin parted, the whistle blew, and the Covenas started to back slowly out into midstream. On her printed passenger list appeared the names of Mr. Stanley Larkin, bound for St. Thomas, her first port of call, and Mr. John Robinson, booked through to Georgetown, British Guiana. Both young gentlemen were aboard, as we have seen, but as a matter of fact they had changed tickets—and identities for the voyage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Of that pleasant voyage it is unnecessary to speak, since nothing occurred upon it that bears upon this story. Jack, that is to say the real Jack, went ashore at the island of St. Thomas, where, under the name of Larkin, he booked passage back to New York on the Lobos, first returning steamer of the same line. \\n\\n \\n\\n In St. Thomas he received a cablegram, which read, when decoded: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Still holding my job. Nothing new. Love. \\n\\n \\n\\n KATE. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n In seventeen days from the time he left he was off quarantine again. According to an arrangement effected through Mr. Delamare\u0027s good offices, the health officer\u0027s boat took Jack off the Lobos and landed him on Staten Island, whence he made his way via Elizabeth to Newark without setting foot on Manhattan. This was in case the astute \"Mr. B\" should take it into his head to have the Lobos watched when she docked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack went to a hotel in Newark, where it had been arranged he was to receive Kate\u0027s reports. He found awaiting him a day by day account of the life of Bobo\u0027s household which did credit to Kate\u0027s faculty of observation. It contained, however, no suggestion of what he so much wished to find, the re?ntrance of \"Mr. B\" upon the scene. Only a few characteristic excerpts from Kate\u0027s reports need be given. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n November 25th: Miriam has embarked on a perfect orgy of spending. All day long, dresses, furs, hats are being delivered at the hotel, not to speak of the dozens of expensive, useless knickknacks that catch her eye in the stores. It is part of my duty to unwrap the packages. Lots of the things she never even looks at when they get home. She buys, I am sure, largely for the pleasure of seeing the salespeople fawn when she gives her name and address. It is a never-failing pleasure to her to announce who she is. Sometimes she takes me with her on a shopping expedition because she thinks I lend style to the outfit. She talks French to me in public. Such French! She bought an automobile to-day, a Vickers-Lee landaulet, price $8,000. She intends to have two men on the box, when she can get their liveries made. A man from Mercer\u0027s, the fashionable jewelers, brought an amazing array of pearls and diamonds to the hotel this afternoon. She chose a strand of pearls. I don\u0027t know the price. Such unbridled extravagance outrages my New England conscience. I hope you\u0027ll be able to put a stop to it soon. \\n\\n \\n\\n ******* \\n\\n \\n\\n Nov. 27th: M.\u0027s heart is set on having a mansion on upper Fifth avenue, whence she can institute a social campaign. When she is not at the dressmaker\u0027s she is being taken around to see such places. The servility of the well-dressed young real estate agents delights her. She gives Bobo no peace on the subject, but I believe he has avoided committing himself as yet. As she has me fussing over her clothes or her hair almost every moment that she is at home, I hear most of their conjugal discussions. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nov. 28th: The new secretary came to-day. I dislike him intensely. His name is Leroy Chalfonte. He is a handsome young fellow in a brutal, scornful way, the type that makes fools of many silly women. His manners are superficially good enough, but he doesn\u0027t trouble to hide the sneer. I gather that he and Miriam spend the afternoons in the tango parlors. He is covertly insolent to Bobo, who dares not call him down. \\n\\n \\n\\n ******* \\n\\n \\n\\n Dec. 5th: This is no easy job to hold. M.\u0027s method with servants seems to be that of certain misguided parents with their offspring. I believe it is called \"breaking their spirit.\" When she gets up in a bad temper, positively nothing that I can do pleases. The more patient and willing I am, the greater offense it is. I have found it better to be a little impudent at such times. She expects it, and she can then abuse me with a better face. Sometimes I am sorry for the poor creature. She has never known a moment\u0027s real happiness, I am sure. You would think that now she would feel as if her ambition was realized, but no! Mercer\u0027s have a pearl necklace worth a hundred and fifty thousand, and she can think of nothing else. I hope you have taken precautions against Bobo\u0027s attempting to gratify any such whim. \\n\\n \\n\\n ******* \\n\\n \\n\\n Dec. 11th: Yesterday Miriam had a talk with somebody over the telephone. She used the instrument in her boudoir. I had a perfectly natural excuse to enter the room while she was talking, but she ordered me out. I made out this much. That somebody was insisting on something that she objected to—somebody that she was in awe of. Thinking perhaps of the danger of somebody listening in, she made a date to continue the talk from an outside \u0027phone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n This last entry on Kate\u0027s report was dated only the day before. Since her communication gave Jack nothing to go on, all he could do was to wait until he heard from her again. She would learn of the arrival of the Lobos from the newspapers, and would without doubt call him up at his hotel at the first opportunity. \\n\\n \\n\\n At nine o\u0027clock that night Jack got his call, and heard the voice that was dearest to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jack!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kitty, dearest!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, my dear, it\u0027s so good to hear you! Are you quite well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right as a trivet! And you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m well. But I can\u0027t stand that woman much longer!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Kitty! I know. Where are you \u0027phoning from?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Booth in a drug-store.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it safe?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes! They\u0027ve gone to the theater, and to dance afterwards. They won\u0027t be home until three or after. She insists on my staying up to put her to bed, but they know I go out while they\u0027re out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you any news for me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I think I have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shoot!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You remember in my last letter I said Miriam had had a telephone conversation yesterday that seemed to agitate her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I think I have the explanation. Last night when I was putting my lady to bed—Oh, my dear, you\u0027ll never know what I have been through!—Bobo said, apropos of nothing, but only anxious to propitiate her, \u0027It will be nice to have some relations, won\u0027t it?\u0027 Miriam replied ill-temperedly: \u0027I\u0027m not so crazy about it.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s Uncle George like?\u0027 asked Bobo. \u0027Just a business man,\u0027 she answered, \u0027a manufacturer of stoves or something.\u0027 \u0027Well fixed?\u0027 asked Bobo. \u0027He must be or he couldn\u0027t have retired,\u0027 she answered.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kate went on: \"Well, Uncle George and Aunt Sally turned up for lunch to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ha!\" said Jack. \"What\u0027s he like?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t fit the descriptions of \u0027Mr. B.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t! Go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a man of fifty-odd, bald, dean-shaven, blue eyes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Short and stocky?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So far so good. Go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was very jolly and good-natured; full of jokes: courteous to everybody, even to me. Just the same, Miriam is afraid of him. She is quite subdued when he is there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good! We\u0027re getting warm. What\u0027s Aunt Sally like?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you describe an old lady? She\u0027s just like another. She probably set up to be a belle in her youth, because she still wears a false front. She\u0027s very quiet. Uncle George talks all the time, and she just listens and nods and smiles. It appears they live in Buffalo and have come to New York for a little gayety. They wanted to see dear Miriam\u0027s husband, of course, so they looked her up at once. They\u0027re staying at the Hotel Abercrombie, but have decided to move to the Madagascar to be nearer dear Miriam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s your opinion, Kitty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not dead certain yet. The most suspicious thing is Miriam\u0027s attitude. Why should she be in such awe of her agreeable uncle? That they have not seen each other for years, as they give out, is certainly false. One of Uncle\u0027s features fits all the descriptions of \u0027Mr. B.\u0027 that we have received. His piercing blue eyes——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good!\" said Jack. \"That\u0027s the one feature he couldn\u0027t change.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If we were not looking for \u0027Mr. B.\u0027 to appear on the scene, and did not know that he was fiendishly clever, I must say I would never suspect Uncle George. He plays his part to perfection. He lets on to be a prosperous man, and asks no favors of Bobo. I gather that he insists on paying his half everywhere. But to-day I got a hint of his possible game. He and Bobo had a long talk in the Dutch room. I made an excuse to pass through as often as I could, and picked up some scraps of their conversation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" said Jack eagerly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uncle George was posing as an experienced and successful man of affairs, see? Without appearing to pry into Bobo\u0027s business, he was setting himself to win his confidence in such matters. Bobo is obviously such a fool that Uncle George no doubt anticipates gaining a complete ascendancy over him, and perhaps sees himself in the position of directing all Bobo\u0027s affairs. But he\u0027s an artist; he carries it off so well, I find myself wondering sometimes if my suspicions aren\u0027t all imaginary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll make sure of that,\" said Jack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you want me to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get me a scrap of his writing if you can—to compare with what I have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And call me up again first chance you get.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61372.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
