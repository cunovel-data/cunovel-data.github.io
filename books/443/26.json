{"id":12421,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"Jack and Bobo returned to the Madagascar without exchanging a word. When they were alone in their rooms, Jack looked at him and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What the deuce am I going to do with you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Best to let me alone,\" said Bobo sullenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I convince you to-day that she was a crook?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That was a nice little sample of her temper that she gave us at the table. Do you want to let yourself in for a lifetime of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack threw up his hands. There was a silence. Bobo was gloomily drawing an imaginary pattern on the arm of his chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You swore to me you would never see her again,\" Jack presently resumed. \"Yet an hour ago you were on your way downtown to get a license, weren\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bobo\u0027s hang-dog silence was equal to a confession. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you expect to keep it out of the papers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bribed the clerk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know what the penalty is for marrying a woman under another man\u0027s name?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What cock and bull story did she tell you to-day to change you again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She told me the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She admitted she\u0027d been working for the old man. But when she found out what his game really was she chucked him. Now she\u0027s actually in danger of her life from him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not too much danger, I guess,\" said Jack. \"You still intend to marry her?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to. It\u0027s my fate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord preserve us!\" cried Jack in a kind of helpless exasperation. \"I really don\u0027t see what there is to do, then, but kick you out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t do that,\" said Bobo sullenly. \"You bluffed me just now down at the Bienvenu, but I\u0027ve been thinking it over. I know you won\u0027t do it now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why won\u0027t I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t afford to. It would spoil all your plans.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was true, but Jack had not given Bobo credit for the shrewdness to perceive it. He tried a new course. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you still believe that Miriam is marrying you for love alone?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care!\" said Bobo recklessly. \"I\u0027m willing to take her on any terms. What chance has a man like me of winning a woman like her ordinarily? It\u0027s gone too far now. I\u0027ve got to have her. She\u0027s in my blood!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack looked at him with a kind of respect. \"Well, anyhow you\u0027re in earnest. I will give you credit for that. But seriously, what are you going to do afterwards? You don\u0027t suppose I\u0027m going to lend you my name and my money for the rest of your life?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bobo shook his head. \"I know the show-down\u0027s got to come some day, perhaps soon. But I\u0027ll make a sneak before that comes. At least I\u0027ll be happy for awhile.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On my money?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, what\u0027s a few thousands to you? Anyhow you got me into this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was truth in this, and Jack felt certain compunctions. But he was amused at the na?ve villainy Bobo proposed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t grudge you the money,\" he said smiling. \"In a way I sympathize with you, since I see you\u0027re really hard hit. But I can\u0027t be a party to any such scheme. In the first place as your friend I\u0027ve got to save you from yourself. You\u0027ll get over this, hard as it seems. Secondly, even though she is a crook, she\u0027s entitled to be protected from a game like this. Why it wouldn\u0027t be a marriage at all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d best let me be,\" said Bobo sullenly. \"You can\u0027t lock me up, and I warn you I\u0027ll do it the first chance I get.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t dare me to prevent you,\" said Jack softly. \"I might find a way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No more was said about the matter, but Jack continued to think about it. \"Bobo put the idea into my head himself,\" he considered. \"Lock him up! Why not? He\u0027s no better than a madman for the time being.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They patched up a temporary truce. Bobo agreed not to try to see Miriam that night, provided Jack would let him make a date with her over the telephone. He called her up in Jack\u0027s hearing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be there to-morrow at eleven. No, I have not changed. Have him there at eleven.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack made no further objections. Had Bobo been wiser, his friend\u0027s apparent complaisance would have aroused his suspicions. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two young men dined together, and spent the evening at the theater in perfect amity. Before going to sleep that night Jack perfected his plans. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Having plenty of money certainly simplifies things,\" he said to himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack was always up at least an hour before Bobo. His first act in the morning was to telephone Mrs. Lizzie Regan, his landlady in humbler days, and still his faithful friend. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Regan,\" said he, \"I need your help. Can you give up to-day to me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, Mr. Nor-Robinson, my dear! Anything to oblige.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, come over to the Madagascar, and have breakfast with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, me! Eat in the Madagascar! I\u0027ll have to dress.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heavens, no! I\u0027m in a hurry! We\u0027ll eat in our suite.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And me a respectable widow woman! Laws, what would the neighbors say!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you\u0027ll come?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will a cat lap cream, my dear!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n While he waited for her, Jack collected every scrap of wearing apparel in Bobo\u0027s room, and the closet adjoining, and carrying it all to another clothes closet, locked it up and pocketed the key. Bobo slept the sleep of the hearty eater throughout. Jack then cut the wires of the telephone in his room, and removed the instrument. Finally he locked the three doors leading out of Bobo\u0027s rooms, and carried away the keys. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bobo still slept on while Jack and Mrs. Regan discussed an excellent breakfast in the Dutch room. The honest lady was greatly impressed by her surroundings. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, it\u0027s a proud day for me to be eating in such style along with one of my own boys that I once passed the beans to. Sure if I\u0027d foreseen this day, I would have given you two eggs to your breakfast, though I will say I never tried to stint the normal appetite of a man!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My appetite must have been abnormal, I guess.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go along! I lost money on you regular!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe you won\u0027t be so glad you came to-day, when you learn what I want you to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Anything short of murder, my dear. What is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack told her the story of Miriam and Bobo—with reservations. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, if it was me, I\u0027d let her marry him. Maybe it would teach the hizzy a lesson. But I suppose you\u0027re right. If more hot-blooded young people were locked up at such times, marriage wouldn\u0027t be such a joke in the vaudeville houses.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to be out a good part of the day on business,\" Jack went on, \"so I\u0027ve got to have somebody to look after him. I asked you to come firstly, because you know the truth about us, and secondly because I thought if he tried to assault you he\u0027d find his match.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027ll soothe him like his own mother.—I brought my umbrella. It\u0027s a good strong one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Before going out Jack went into Bobo\u0027s room. The plump youth, yawning and stretching, was just beginning to think about getting up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen, Bobo,\" said Jack crisply. \"You\u0027ve got to stay in bed to-day. I\u0027ve hidden all your clothes. I\u0027ve engaged a nurse to look after you—and she\u0027ll see that you get your meals. You\u0027d best take it quietly, for I\u0027m giving it out that you\u0027ve been on a tear, and if you make a racket people will think it\u0027s the D.T.\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But—what—why——?\" stammered Bobo. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack slipped out before he had fully recovered his power of speech. He delivered the key of his room to Mrs. Regan. \\n\\n \\n\\n On his way out Jack sought Baldwin the clerk. \"Mr. Norman is sick,\" he said. \"To tell the truth, he\u0027s been hitting too swift a pace lately. The doctor has ordered absolute quiet, and I want you to see that he is not disturbed under any pretext whatever, while I\u0027m out. I\u0027ve left him in charge of a nurse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Baldwin, the discreet, raised no awkward questions about the suddenness of Bobo\u0027s attack, nor where the doctor had come from, but assured Jack that his orders would be obeyed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You remember the lovely lady we saw yesterday?\" Jack went on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rather!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Supposing she comes here and shows a disposition to make a scene, introduce her to Connolly the house detective, see? Tip Connolly off to ask her if she didn\u0027t once go under the name of Beatrice Blackstone and do typewriting work for Silas Gyde here. That ought to calm her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the newsstand Jack bought a copy of a yachting magazine and from the advertising pages picked out the address of a leading firm of yacht brokers. \\n\\n \\n\\n A few minutes later he was seated opposite the head of that firm, a trig little man with apple cheeks and shiny pink pate—he need not be named. Every yachtsman knows him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I represent a well-known millionaire,\" said Jack, \"before I give you his name, or open my business with you, I must ask you to pledge yourself to regard it as confidential.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The broker agreed without reservations. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Jack, \"my name is Robinson, and my employer is Mr. John Farrow Norman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As always, this announcement produced a well-nigh magical effect. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Norman is sick,\" Jack went on, \"the fact is he\u0027s been going the pace, rather, since he came into his money, and now he\u0027s got to pull up with a round turn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The broker expressed a discreet sympathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has instructed me to charter a steam yacht for a Southern cruise, a roomy, comfortable boat. The main consideration is to get something that\u0027s all ready to go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is fortunate that you came to me, Mr. Robinson,\" said the little broker solemnly. \"As it happens I have the very thing you want. I refer to the Columbian, Colonel Oliver Stackpoole\u0027s yacht. Perhaps you know her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One of the finest yachts afloat, sir! Three hundred feet long, and a veritable floating palace! Only yesterday Colonel Stackpoole and a party of friends returned on her from a hunting trip to Jekyl Island. I have just received the Colonel\u0027s note authorizing me to charter her for the Florida season. She has a full complement of men, a complete inventory of stores, she is coaling this minute, and actually has steam up!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That sounds promising,\" said Jack. \"How about terms?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He agreed without batting an eye to the figure named, and the little broker was sorry he had not asked double. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go and look at her,\" said Jack. \"If everything is O.K. you shall have a check this afternoon, and we\u0027ll sail to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The yacht-broker wished that Heaven might send him such clients oftener. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Columbian was lying at a coal dock in Hoboken. It was a matter of half an hour to reach her in the automobile. Jack fell in love with her at sight, and registered a silent vow, that some day when his work was done he would own her outright—or one like her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Though really a great ocean-going vessel, her clipper bows, low hull, raking masts and great funnel conveyed an impression of extreme lightness and grace. She was painted black with a green streak at the water line, and her funnel was yellow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Going aboard, Jack was astonished at the great spread of her decks; almost room enough to drive his car around her; and still more at the size and number of her cabins. Outside, the designer\u0027s effort had been to make the Columbian as shipshape as possible, but below decks he had aimed to make her passengers forget they were at sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the main deck there was a long suite of lofty rooms; grand saloon, music room, library, smoke room. Overhead forward was the dining-saloon, and a sun parlor aft. All these rooms had open fireplaces, windows, and other comforts not generally associated with the sea. The furnishings were beautiful without being too ostentatious. The sleeping cabins were marvels of spaciousness and luxury. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack did not hesitate a moment about taking her. His one regret was that he could not go on the first projected cruise. The fact that the mere signing of his name put him in possession of this wonderful vessel gave him a fuller realization of the power of his wealth than he had yet experienced. \\n\\n \\n\\n He learned that the Columbian would finish coaling during the afternoon. He arranged to have her continue to lie where she was until nine o\u0027clock that night. Thus he could get his party aboard in this out-of-the-way spot after darkness had fallen. The Columbian was then to drop down-stream to an anchorage in the Bay, and proceed to sea next morning. Her Captain was instructed to see to the necessary clearance papers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack repeated his story of Mr. Norman\u0027s illness to the captain. The suggestion was that the millionaire\u0027s mind was slightly affected, and they might be prepared for vagaries. The itinerary of the cruise was to include Charleston, Jacksonville, Nassau and Havana. \\n\\n \\n\\n All arrangements having been completed, Jack returned to the Madagascar. Nothing untoward had occurred in his absence. Miriam had come as he expected, no doubt with every intention of making a scene; but his ruse to confront her with Connolly had worked effectually. She had departed quicker than she came. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upstairs Mrs. Regan reported all well. Finding his \"nurse\" proof against the most tearful and passionate appeals, Bobo had resigned himself to his lot. Indeed, who shall say but that he was not secretly relieved thus to have the responsibility of making a decision taken from him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack told Mrs. Regan what he had done. An assiduous reader of the newspapers, it appeared that she knew all about the magnificence of the Columbian. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How would you like to take a cruise in her?\" Jack asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me! Oh law! What a life of adventure!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall have a stateroom de luxe, with a brass bedstead, and a dressing-table furnished with gold!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What me! Lizzie Regan! Oh law!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you get away to-night?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d chuck a dozen boarding-houses for such a chance! Sure! As it happens the house is full, and I\u0027ve got a cook who is not quite feeble-minded. My cousin will run in and keep an eye on things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s settled then. Run along and get ready, and I\u0027ll watch Bobo till you get back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bobo listened to the plan of the proposed cruise in sullen apathy. Jack could not tell what he meditated doing. In order to be on the safe side, Jack called on Hugh Brome, his lawyer, to assist him with the evening\u0027s arrangements. It promised to be a great lark—for everybody except Bobo. \\n\\n \\n\\n At nine o\u0027clock that night an invalid completely swathed in blankets was tenderly carried out of the private side door of the Madagascar by two friends, and placed in a waiting limousine. A comfortable-looking nurse hovered over him solicitously. Any passerby might have been surprised to hear convulsive giggles from the three attendants—but perhaps he would have put it down to nervousness. Obviously the patient was very sick. But if the wrappings had fallen away from his head, the passerby would certainly have been astonished to see that he was gagged! \\n\\n \\n\\n An hour later Jack and Hugh Brome stood on the coal dock watching the superb vessel back out into the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s out of harm\u0027s way for awhile,\" said Jack. \"He has no clothes aboard but dressing-gowns and slippers!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61361.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
