{"id":12413,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Jack had not yet succeeded in establishing just where Miriam and Mrs. Cleaver fitted into the jig-saw puzzle he had to solve. Miriam, from the foreknowledge he had gained from Silas Gyde\u0027s letter, he had no hesitating in dubbing an out-and-out bad one, but he was less sure about Clara. He set himself to discover more about her. \n \n There was nothing mysterious about her origin, and he had no difficulty in learning the main facts about her from outside sources. She was a poor girl, the daughter of a great physician who had lived beyond his means. She had married before her father\u0027s death, the son of a wealthy and prominent family, but he, having run through his fortune, shot himself. She had, therefore, been left penniless, nor had she, so far as was known, received any legacy since his death. \n \n To Jack, therefore, the grand question was, where did she get the money that provided the Park Avenue house, the bands of servants, the magnificent entertainments; the dresses, jewels, furs and automobiles. It was charitably said that she had made it in lucky speculations, but Jack was not satisfied with that. One must have something to speculate with. There had never been any scandal in connection with her name. \n \n These parties of Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s offered no lack of food for speculation. In her way Clara was quite the rage, and every element of smart New York society was represented among the guests—except perhaps the most hide-bound exclusives. She always took care to provide, too, a leaven of clever artistic people, \"to amuse the rich,\" she said. \n \n So far everything was usual and explainable, but there was always another element present that mystified Jack. This consisted of various young people of both sexes, always good-looking, perfectly dressed and at least superficially well-bred; often vivacious and charming—but invariably with hard, wary eyes. \n \n These self-possessed youngsters turned up mysteriously, and were as mysteriously lost sight of again. They made a convenience of Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s house almost as if it had been a hotel. Mrs. Cleaver introduced them effusively at her parties like dear friends, but at other times she ignored them—and they as frankly returned the compliment. Sometimes they made good independently of her and enjoyed a more or less brief career in society. Sometimes they disappeared and were seen no more. \n \n Mrs. Cleaver was not by any means a prudent, wary woman, and it was not difficult for Jack to learn where she banked. She often took him about with her. She had four bank accounts. Through the good offices of Mr. Delamare Jack next learned from the books of the banks concerned, that she had been in the habit of depositing a thousand dollars weekly. In other words, every Friday afternoon she took a thousand dollars downtown and added it to one of her four accounts. \n \n Having learned so much, the next time Friday came around Jack took care to be on hand early at the Cleaver house. He kept his eyes open for all that took place that morning. Just before lunch a messenger boy delivered a small packet for Mrs. Cleaver. Jack by a casual question or two of a servant, learned that this was a regular happening on Friday mornings, and that the packet was always carried direct to Mrs. Cleaver by her orders. \n \n Jack, who had already learned from Anderson of the large part played by the messenger service in Mr. B.\u0027s operations, guessed that this packet came direct from him. It was a good enough working theory anyway. Fifty thousand a year was no mean price! For that, Jack figured, Mrs. Cleaver lent her name and social position to the blackmailers, and allowed them to use her house as a base of operations. It was likely he thought that she did not know what their game was, and with that handsome sum coming in so regularly, did not care to inquire. \n \n Jack conceived the bold idea of enlightening Mrs. Cleaver, trusting to her better qualities to turn her against her present employer, and ally her with himself. \n \n His opportunity to talk to her alone came that night, when Miriam and Bobo failed to return for dinner. Jack and Clara dined alone. \n \n At the end of the meal she said listlessly: \"Where shall we go to-night?\" \n \n \"Let\u0027s not go anywhere for a change,\" said Jack. \"Let\u0027s have a fire in the library, and sit and talk.\" \n \n That struck her as a pleasantly novel idea. \"All right. I\u0027m sick of the game to-night. And you\u0027re a restful person.\" \n \n Jack smiled a little grimly, thinking that what he had to say to the lady would not exactly be restful. \n \n When they were comfortably established before the fire, he began to lead up to it gradually. \n \n \"This society game is a funny one, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"How do you mean?\" \n \n \"Well, here you are spending your life rushing around like a mad woman to teas and dinners and dances, theaters, operas, fashionable shows of every kind. What do you get out of it, really?\" \n \n \"God knows!\" she said wearily. \n \n \"When you\u0027re not tearing around to other peoples\u0027 shows you\u0027re having one of your own. Lord! what a gabbling mob! To hear them, you\u0027d think they loved each other to death, and positively worshiped you. And as a matter of fact nobody gives a single damn!\" \n \n \"That\u0027s true.\" \n \n \"Then why do you do it? It must cost a heap of money.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said slowly. \"Habit, I suppose. In the beginning it seemed like the only thing open to a woman like me, the only way to get on; to build up a social position I mean, and so be powerful. Now I have it, I find there\u0027s nothing in it.\" \n \n \"Then why don\u0027t you give it up.\" \n \n She looked at him in a scared way. \"How could I? I\u0027m in the thick of the game. I\u0027ve got to play it out. What else could I do? Where could I go?\" \n \n \"You have real friends, I suppose.\" \n \n \"I had once. But after the scramble of the last three years—I don\u0027t know——!\" \n \n The words \"three years\" struck Jack with meaning. That corresponded exactly with the period of \"Mr. B.\u0027s\" activities. \n \n \"Any one could begin a new life if they really wished,\" he said. \n \n She looked at him queerly. \"You\u0027re not leading up to a proposal of marriage, are you?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Jack, smiling. \n \n \"It sounded like it,\" she said, settling back. \"I like you ever so much, but of course it wouldn\u0027t do.\" \n \n \"I have wondered why you never married again,\" he said. \"So many men——!\" \n \n \"Oh, they don\u0027t mean anything. It\u0027s just the fashion to pay me attention. They look on me more as an institution than a woman. The ones who do come to the point of asking me are always horrid—or poor.\" \n \n \"But you have plenty.\" \n \n \"The appearances of wealth are illusory.\" \n \n \"I should think fifty thousand a year——\" \n \n She laughed lightly. \"Where did you get that idea? I haven\u0027t the half of it.\" \n \n There was a silence while Jack debated how to go on. \n \n \"Clara, I would really like to be your friend,\" he said at last. \n \n \"That\u0027s nice of you.\" \n \n \"If you only felt disposed to tell me frankly of your situation and your difficulties, perhaps I could help you.\" \n \n Something in this alarmed her; she favored him with a sharp little glance. \"Mercy!\" she said, turning it off with a laugh. \"I haven\u0027t any special difficulties that I know of.\" \n \n \"Who are these mysterious hard-eyed young people that come and go in this house as if they owned it? I mean George Thatcher, Emily Coster, Grace Marsden, and the others. Miriam herself; who is she, and where did she come from? She\u0027s no cousin of yours.\" \n \n Frank terror leaped out of Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s eyes. She attempted to mask it with a semblance of anger. \"They are my friends! Am I obliged to give you an account of them!\" \n \n \"Queer friends!\" murmured Jack. \"You scarcely speak to them unless there are outsiders here.\" \n \n \"What do you mean by taking this tone towards me!\" \n \n \"I wish to be your friend. Don\u0027t force me to believe the worst of you. If your conscience is clear, why should you fear a few plain questions?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll hear what they are first. I don\u0027t like your tone.\" \n \n \"You receive a thousand dollars every week. Where does it come from?\" \n \n A fresh terror shot out of her eyes, and again she sought to hide it under a towering anger. \"What impudent nonsense is this?\" \n \n Jack went on imperturbably: \"It is brought to you by a messenger in cash every Friday morning, and every Friday afternoon you carry it to the bank.\" \n \n \"You have been spying on me! And you talk about being my friend?\" \n \n \"I do wish to be your friend. It is true I have been spying on you, as you call it. I was forced to it by my duty to an older friend. Are you going to answer my question?\" \n \n \"Certainly not! What right have you to question me about my private affairs! A paid secretary! This is what I get for admitting you to my friendship!\" \n \n \"To lose your temper and to insult me puts you in the worst possible light, you know. That is how a guilty conscience always acts.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s nothing to me what you think of me. You can go.\" \n \n \"I am not going,\" Jack said quietly. \"You and I have got to have this out.\" \n \n She had now worked herself up to a fine pitch of anger. She laughed, but there was little amusement in the sound. \"I\u0027ve got to have it out with you, have I? With you! Oh, this is rich! This is the perfection of impudence! Will you go, or must I call a servant to show you the door?\" \n \n She sprang up as she spoke, and her hand approached the bell button. Gone was her listlessness now. \n \n \"You will not do that,\" said Jack quietly. \n \n Her thumb rested on the button. \"Why won\u0027t I?\" she demanded. \n \n \"Because you don\u0027t know yet how much I know.\" \n \n Her hand dropped irresolutely. \"What is it to me what you think you know. Are you trying to blackmail me?\" \n \n \"I am not.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s your game then?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell you if you don\u0027t have me put out,\" said Jack, smiling dryly. \n \n She agitatedly paced the room. \n \n Jack went on: \"I am doing you the credit of supposing that you do not know the true source of the money you spend.\" \n \n \"You are accusing me of dishonesty perhaps,\" she said haughtily. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know how honest you are,\" said Jack simply. \"I am not acquainted with the terms of your agreement with Mr. B.\" \n \n She stopped as if she had been transfixed. She went white to the lips. \"Mr. B.!\" she whispered. \"You know him!\" \n \n \"I know this much,\" said Jack slowly. \"The thousand dollars a week which he sends you is the proceeds of blackmail—and murder!\" \n \n She staggered. He thought she was swooning, and sprang to catch her. But she fended him off, and sank in a chair unaided. It was a full minute before she could speak. \n \n \"You are just trying—to frighten me,\" she murmured huskily. \n \n \"I shall prove it before I go.\" \n \n \"What—what do you want of me?\" \n \n \"I expect when I prove to you the truth of what I say, that you will repudiate Mr. B. and his generous allowance, and help me to hang him.\" \n \n She did not answer at once, but only stared at him with big eyes. \n \n \"You will not accept anything further from him, of course.\" \n \n Still she did not answer. \n \n \"Will you knowingly help to levy blackmail, and to bring about additional murders?\" \n \n She burst into tears. \"How do I know what to do?\" she wailed. \"You haven\u0027t proved what you say! How do I know what your game is? I have nothing—not a sou! Where am I to go! How could I live?\" \n \n Notwithstanding her pretended astonishment, indignation, dismay, Jack saw that she had always been secretly conscious of living over a volcano. She had no doubt resolutely averted her face from it, but had dwelt in daily expectation of this dreadful scene. \n \n \"As to the means of existence, you need not worry,\" said Jack. \"I shall take care of that.\" \n \n \"You?\" \n \n He saw that he had gone too far. \"I mean Bobo of course. It is his game I am playing.\" \n \n \"Who was murdered?\" she asked abruptly. \n \n \"Silas Gyde for one; Ames Benton for another.\" \n \n \"Anarchists committed those crimes.\" \n \n \"Two poor mad youths were used to carry out the purpose of a devilishly sane brain—our friend Mr. B. in fact.\" \n \n For the last time she attempted to bluff it out. She yawned elaborately, though the hand with which she covered her pretty mouth still trembled. \"Mercy! It sounds like a melodrama! You must excuse me if I cannot swallow it entire. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve been too faithful a student of the movies.\" \n \n \"Shall I describe Mr. B. to you?\" said Jack. \"His favorite disguise I mean: he probably has many disguises. He is a smallish man but rather heavy; not corpulent, but thick-set. He is always well dressed in a decent, sober style. He has piercing blue eyes, and wears a heavy gray mustache, and a little goatee or imperial. He has an old-fashioned look, due principally to the way he wears his hair; that is brushed forward of his ears in the manner popular fifty years ago. He has very courteous manners and is given to rather bookish, literary turns of speech.\" \n \n The remnants of Clara Cleaver\u0027s courage oozed away. She sagged down in her chair white and shaken. \"That is the man,\" she whispered. \"What are you going to do with me?\" \n \n \"Why does he send you all this money?\" asked Jack. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she meekly replied. \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll give you my guess. It is to secure your house as a base for the young birds of prey that hunt in society. These are the spies that furnish him with the information about rich people necessary to his blackmailing business.\" \n \n \"It can\u0027t be as bad as all that!\" she murmured with weak horror. \n \n \"How else do you explain George Thatcher and Grace Marsden—and Miriam.\" \n \n \"You are not sure of what you say.\" \n \n \"You know in your heart it is true. As to Miriam, I am sure. Mr. Gyde left us a detailed account of how she tried to spy on him, and a faithful description of her. Ever notice the mole on her right forefinger?\" \n \n She shook her head. \"Oh, there\u0027ll be a horrible public scandal!\" she wailed fretfully. \"I\u0027ll be disgraced forever—though I have done nothing!\" \n \n \"Except take his money,\" Jack put in dryly. \n \n \"How did I know? Where am I to hide my head now! Oh, I wish I\u0027d never laid eyes on you!\" \n \n Jack took a new tack. \"Well, I see I can expect no help from you,\" he said, making as if to go. \n \n \"Wait!\" she said quickly. \"Don\u0027t leave me! I shall go out of my mind if I\u0027m left alone! If I tell you everything I know, will you promise to save me from public disgrace?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll do my best.\" \n \n \"Sit down. I\u0027ll have to go back to the beginning. It\u0027s a long story.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61353.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
