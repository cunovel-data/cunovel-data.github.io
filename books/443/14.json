{"id":12409,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"Another thing that Jack had in mind was the necessity of disguising himself. Being an entire stranger to the art of make-up, he required instruction. Ralph, their private bell-boy at the Madagascar, had seemed the likeliest person to apply to in such a case. Leaving the hotel that morning, Jack had said to him carelessly: \n \n \"I\u0027m invited to a masquerade. Where\u0027s the best place to go for an outfit? I want something better than the ordinary costumer.\" \n \n \"Why don\u0027t you try Harmon Evers?\" was the reply. \"All the theatrical people go to him. He\u0027s the greatest make-up artist in New York.\" \n \n \"Where\u0027s his place?\" \n \n \"Twenty-ninth street, just east of the Avenue.\" \n \n Jack now bent his steps in that direction. He discovered a neat little shop on the street level with a sign reading: \n \n HARMON EVERS, WIGS AND THEATRICAL MAKEUP. \n \n \n In each of the two paneled show-windows one marvelous wig was displayed on its stand, nothing else. The interior was discreetly curtained from view. Opening the door, the pungent odor of grease paints greeted Jack\u0027s nostrils. Inside was as neat as out. There was a showcase setting forth cosmetics, and a counter beyond with another wig or two on stands. Back of the counter were tiers of drawers neatly labeled. The wall outside the counter was filled by a collection of small engravings of historical personages with especial regard to their hirsute appendages. Away back in the shop were several curtained alcoves for trying on. \n \n Behind the counter sat a little, dumpy old lady befrilled and befrizzed, who suggested an erstwhile favorite of the boards now retired. Her large, faded eyes fell on Jack with a startled look, which however instantly disappeared in the polite saleswoman, as she inquired what he wished. \n \n It appeared that Mr. Evers was engaged with a customer. \n \n This customer presently issued from one of the alcoves, a dandy of the old school who was obviously much beholden to the wig-maker\u0027s art. Evers followed at his heels, rubbing his hands, and proudly surveying his work. Jack had the impression of a stout, rubicund little man of middle-age, clean-shaven and bald as an egg. True to the custom of tradesmen generally, he neglected his trade in his own person. \n \n He was talking volubly as he came: \"A very interesting question, sir, the relation of brains to hair. It is popularly supposed that a bald head is the result of great mental activity, but I have not found it so in my practice. Among ordinary men it is about six of one and half a dozen of the other. But I believe that a man cannot rise to real heights of greatness without a good head of hair. Yes, I know, there was Julius Caesar, and I admit it would be difficult to prove my case by historical examples, because wigs have always been procurable, and fashionable portrait painters naturally do not call attention to them. But it is an interesting speculation. Good morning, sir.\" \n \n Jack asked to speak to Mr. Evers in private, and was shown into one of the alcoves. It was like a theatrical dressing-room, with a mirror surrounded by electric lights, and a shelf beneath. \n \n Jack did not offer to tell who he was, and the little wig-maker, who seemed the soul of discretion, betrayed no curiosity on the subject. Jack came to the point at once. \n \n \"Circumstances make it necessary for me to do a little private detective work, and I\u0027m obliged to learn how to disguise myself, well enough I mean, so I can go about the streets without danger of recognition. Can it be done?\" \n \n \"Certainly,\" said Mr. Evers. \"It is done oftener than you suppose.\" \n \n \"What sort of disguise do you recommend?\" \n \n \"Let me think,\" said Mr. Evers, putting a thoughtful finger to his chin. \n \n Jack was sitting facing the mirror, while Evers stood behind him studying his reflection through half closed eyes. Meanwhile Jack took stock of him. In repose the garrulous little man\u0027s face showed unexpected lines of resolution. He had a strong eye. That kind of eye may be found in wig-maker or bank president, but whatever the trade of the possessor may be, it is a pretty safe guess that he is master of it. All the visible part of Evers\u0027 skin, neck, face, skull, was of a curious angry pink shade—but not unhealthy. He had but a fringe of gray hair around the base of his skull, and his eyebrows were scanty. Certainly, in extolling the superiority of hairy men he had been disinterested. \n \n \"It is a good mask,\" he said—meaning Jack\u0027s face. \"Good bones, well placed. A promising foundation for me to work on. You are young, too. No tell-tale lines for me to erase. Your hair is too luxuriant, but I don\u0027t suppose you want me to cut it.\" \n \n \"What would be the gain if it altered my usual appearance?\" \n \n \"True, true! We\u0027ll get around that somehow. Difficulties only add zest to the artist\u0027s work.\" \n \n After studying a little longer he said: \"Since your purpose is to escape observation, I would suggest making you as insignificant as possible. Say a business man in a small way; industrious but not very bright; of very ordinary taste both in ideas and dress.\" \n \n \"My idea exactly!\" said Jack. \n \n \"But I must impress upon you that my work here with false hair and pigments is only the beginning. To be successful our character must be constructed from the inside out. Before you leave here I will write out a description of the character as I see it, which I will ask you to study at your leisure. I particularly recommend that you repeat it to yourself just before falling asleep at night. It is the surest way of impressing it on your subconsciousness.\" \n \n \"Fine!\" said Jack, more and more taken with the philosophic wig-maker. \n \n Evers began to lay out the implements of his trade. While he worked he talked uninterruptedly. \n \n \"I assure you one\u0027s subconsciousness is all-important. Most people, unknown to themselves, play an assumed part throughout their lives, a part that has been suggested to the subconsciousness in early life by something they admire in other people or in books. When some great disturbance brings the real self to light people are amazed at what they discover in themselves.—Remove your coat, waistcoat and collar, please.\" \n \n \"Make it simple, please,\" said Jack. \"Something that I can put off and on myself at need.\" \n \n \"The best art is always simple,\" said Mr. Evers. \"First a wash for the entire face and neck. It is very thin and contains no grease to betray you in the sunlight. Its purpose is merely to dim the youthful glow of health that distinguishes you. See! You look fifteen years older already! A slightly darker tone under the eyes gives you a sedentary, slightly bilious look. Next heavy eyebrows, which with round spectacles will give you an owlish expression. Also a stiff, closely cropped mustache. You put on eyebrows and mustache with loose hair and glue which I will furnish you. Comb them out and clip them to the desired length after they are stuck on. The ready-made articles never look natural. You may depend upon the glue. It is my own invention. No amount of heat nor perspiration, nor soap and water can affect it, but it melts at a touch of alcohol. Lastly, pomade your hair liberally, and slick it down hard. See, it makes your hair look thin, and alters the whole shape of your head. There you are!\" \n \n \"Wonderful!\" said Jack, gazing at his strangely altered aspect. \n \n \"Oh, we\u0027ve only just begun!\" said Mr. Evers. \"Next comes the question of clothes. Its importance cannot be exaggerated. Taste in clothes is of slow growth. The clothes of a youth tell you nothing, but a mature man\u0027s attire betrays him unerringly. Let me see! This requires study. We shall probably not hit it exactly at the first trial. I should say first a derby hat of very conservative shape, slightly old-fashioned, and a suit stiffly cut, of good material but ugly pattern of cloth. Shirt and necktie are very significant. They should be of common design and coloring, such as might be picked up at a sale. I have all such things here. The suit may not fit you perfectly, but it will take you as far as a clothing store where you can buy another.\" \n \n In due course Jack was ready to brave the sunshine in his new guise. The charge was steep, but he could not deny that the work was worth it. He left his other clothes with Mr. Evers since he would have to return to the shop to change. The wig-maker stood off and examined him with satisfaction. Mrs. Evers was called on to admire her husband\u0027s work. \n \n \"What name would you suggest for my new character?\" asked Jack, smiling. \n \n Mr. Evers took the matter with entire seriousness. \"Let me see—you look to me as if your name might be——\" His face cleared—\"I have it! Your name is certainly Mr. Pitman.\" \n \n \"Mr. Pitman it shall be!\" \n \n \"Mr. Fred Pitman,\" added Evers. \n \n As Jack left the shop it was a few minutes before twelve, that is to say, just about the time he had designed to try out his new character for the first. He made his way up to Forty-Second street, and took up his station before the building that housed the offices of the Eureka Protective Association. \n \n Here he walked slowly up and down well lost in the crowd hurrying east and west. He found his disguise effective in that the passers-by no longer noticed him. Only when people stopped looking at him did Jack become aware that in his proper person he attracted friendly glances wherever he went. That started a curious speculation in his mind: \"How do people know whether they want to look at you or not, if they don\u0027t look at you first to see what you are like?\" \n \n It was half-past twelve before the man he was waiting for appeared. Mr. Dave Anderson turned east on Forty-Second street at a brisk pace. The pseudo-Pitman followed close at his heels. The chase led across Fifth and Madison and in front of the Grand Central station. Jack began to fear that Anderson lived in the neighborhood, and was bound home. \n \n But at a modest saloon on Lexington avenue, a place with a long-established air, he turned in. After loitering a moment or two outside Jack followed. Behind the saloon was a small glass-roofed \"garden\" set with tables. The settled familiar style of the waiters and diners suggested that this was a real eating-place. Jack commended Mr. Anderson\u0027s discrimination. \n \n The tables accommodated four or six, and none was entirely vacant. It was therefore perfectly natural for Jack to seek one of the chairs at the table occupied by Anderson and another man. They made him welcome. Anderson scarcely looked at Jack. \n \n The bill-of-fare provided Jack with an opening. \"Are you a regular here?\" he asked Anderson. \"What\u0027s good?\" \n \n \"To-day, the pot roast with noodles,\" was the prompt reply. \n \n It came and it was good. Jack\u0027s hearty commendation of the dish led naturally to a further exchange of amenities. When one of any two people has a positive disposition to make friends, the task is usually not difficult. Mr. Anderson discovered in this chance acquaintance a man after his own heart, who thought the same as he on all important matters. They were soon talking like old cronies. They finished eating simultaneously, and left the place together. Anderson, who was of an expansive nature, had already mentioned that he ran a detective agency. \n \n \"You don\u0027t say!\" said Mr. Pitman with an air of strong interest not unmixed with envy. \"Well, say, that\u0027s more fun than pounding the pavements collecting overdue bills like I do.\" \n \n \"You must come around to my office some time, and let me show you a thing or two,\" said Mr. Anderson affably. \n \n Jack was careful to accept the invitation as casually as it was given. \"I sure will some time,\" he said. \n \n They parted. \n \n Jack went his way thinking with satisfaction: \"There\u0027s my second line started, all right.\" \n \n Mr. Pitman\u0027s business was now done for the day, and Jack thought it was high time Mr. Robinson re-embodied himself to look after his employer. But before he changed back he had a strong desire to test his disguise on some one who knew him better than Anderson. He thought of Kate. By this time she must be in the thick of her preparations to open her house. \n \n To think of it was to turn his steps in that direction. In ten minutes he was at the foot of the steps. Sure enough the house was already transformed; wooden shutters taken down, doors and windows flung open, and a small army of workmen and cleaners visible inside. \n \n \"Verily, Kate is a wonder!\" he said to himself. \n \n Mounting the steps, he rang the bell with twinkling eyes. Kate herself answered the door. Jack, seeing her come through the dark hall, experienced a rush of delight. With her capable, businesslike air she was more adorable than ever. Jack longed to fling his arms around her to see how the business woman would take it—but fortunately restrained himself from an act so rash. She fronted him with a polite, inquiring look. It gives one a queer turn to meet that look on a familiar face. \n \n \"Is this Miss Storer?\" he asked as polite as herself, though he was bubbling inside. \n \n Kate had stoutly denied the necessity of her taking an assumed name. \n \n She bowed. \n \n \"I understand you are fitting out this house to rent furnished apartments.\" \n \n She seemed slightly surprised. \"Yes. But may I ask how you learned of it?\" \n \n \"Oh, a friend told me.\" \n \n \"What kind of accommodations do you require?\" \n \n Jack was hard put to it to keep from laughing in her face. Up till now he had been standing in the vestibule with the light behind him. But as Kate stood aside from the door, he stepped in and turned around, so thus his make-up was put to a full test. \n \n \"A room in the back,\" he, said, \"away from the noises of the street. And not too high up. The second story rear would suit me very well.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said soberly, \"that room is already taken.\" \n \n Jack could contain himself no longer. There was no one near. He took off his glasses and smiled his own smile. \"Don\u0027t you know me?\" he whispered. \n \n Kate gasped and fell back a step. \"Oh! I wasn\u0027t expecting you so soon!\" \n \n Jack chuckled. \n \n A charwoman with bucket and brush came through the hall, and they were obliged to pull themselves together quickly. \n \n \"The gentleman who said he wanted that room may not come back,\" said Kate. \"I\u0027ll show it to you anyway.\" \n \n She led him upstairs. She had not yet touched Silas Gyde\u0027s room, and as they went in she was obliged to close the door after them to keep the people in the house from seeing the strange conglomeration inside. \n \n Jack seized her hand. \"Katy, darling, you take my breath away, you\u0027re so wonderful!\" he said, trying to draw her towards him. \n \n She would have none of that. \"Behave yourself!\" she said crushingly. \"You know very well why I had to close the door! How can I go on with this if you\u0027re going to act in such a way! Please remember who you\u0027re supposed to be! Do you suppose I\u0027m going to be familiar with my lodgers!\" \n \n \"Oh, I forgot everything except how sweet you are!\" groaned Jack. \n \n \"Look in the glass!\" she said. \"Do you suppose I want that yellow face near mine?\" \n \n He frowned and rubbed his chin ruefully, not quite knowing how to take this left-handed compliment. \"But—but I shan\u0027t be able to see you for ages, except as Pitman,\" he complained. \n \n \"Well, I shall survive it,\" she said briskly. \n \n \"Aw, Katy!\" \n \n She changed the subject in her own prompt way. \"It\u0027s really a wonderful disguise!\" she said. \"How ever did you do it?\" \n \n He told her of his experience with Evers. \n \n \"And you,\" he said, \"you haven\u0027t let any grass grow under your feet. You can open up to-morrow.\" \n \n \"Hardly that. My greatest problem is this room. How can I let the cleaners in here?\" \n \n \"You and I had better do this,\" said Jack, careful not to betray any pleasure in the prospect. \n \n \"How can you find time?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll send Bobo to a musical comedy to-night, and slip in through the vault. That is if you\u0027ll be here to-night.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve already fitted up a room for Mother and I. We\u0027ll be here.\" \n \n \"Good!\" said Jack. The prospect of a stolen interview with the demure Kate was unspeakably delightful. \n \n He told her something of his adventures the night before. \n \n \"What a fool you have on your hands!\" said Kate scornfully. \"You\u0027d better hurry back and see what he\u0027s up to now.\" \n \n \"But I\u0027ve heaps more to tell you.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m busy. So are you. Tell me to-night. What will the servants say if we stay in here with the door closed? Run along!\" \n \n And she fairly shooed him out of the house. \n \n Jack hastened down to Evers\u0027 shop, washed his face, changed his clothes, and returned to the Madagascar. Evers provided him with everything necessary to re-assume the personality of Mr. Pitman when the time came. \n \n Bobo was out. Jack applied to Ralph for information as to his movements. That preturnaturally knowing youth was bursting with it. \n \n \"Sure, I seen him go out. \u0027Bout an hour ago. Young lady come for him.\" \n \n In spite of himself Jack was betrayed into a startled exclamation. \n \n Thus encouraged, Ralph went on with gusto. \"She called him up this morning—that is I guess it was the same one. I was in the room brushin\u0027 his clo\u0027es, and I answered the \u0027phone. I hears a voice like butter creams: \u0027Is this Mr. Norman?\u0027 Umm! But when she found it was me the cream froze.\" \n \n \"Mr. Norman goes to the \u0027phone, and say, you could see by the smile that tickled his ears that she was feedin\u0027 him the Martha Washingtons then. \u0027Aw\u0027fly good of you to call me up,\u0027 says he. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think it was improper at all.\u0027 Then she must have ast him to lunch, for he said \u0027Sure!\u0027 in a voice that near cracked the transmitter, and bounced up and down like a kid when it sees its bottle. \n \n \"But then he remembered somepin and his joy was turned to grief. \u0027Oh, I forgot, I can\u0027t come,\u0027 he says. I heard her voice squeakin\u0027 over the wire: \u0027Why?\u0027 He says: \u0027I got a date with my secretary: very important business.\u0027 After that she did most of the talkin\u0027. He only said: \u0027I can\u0027t! I can\u0027t! Say, I\u0027m sorry!\u0027 And so on. Say, he stuck to it, too, and at last she hung up. Say, he was almost cryin\u0027 when he come away. He throws himself down on the bed and never says a word to me.\" \n \n \"Well, what then?\" asked Jack. \n \n \"About half an hour after I was down in the office when I hear a young lady in a Kolinsky cape ask at the desk for Mr. Norman. A looker?—say, boss, some scenery! I was sent up with her card. On the back she had written: \n \n \"I have come for you.\" \n \n \"Did he go?\" asked Jack. \n \n \"Did he go? Does a chicken run when it hears the corn fall in the yard!\" \n \n \"Hm! What name was on the card?\" \n \n \"Miss Miriam Culbreth.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61349.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
