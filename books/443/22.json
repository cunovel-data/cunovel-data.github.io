{"id":12417,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"Jack—in the character of Mr. Pitman, had now reached a degree of intimacy with Dave Anderson, manager of the Eureka Protective Association, sufficient to enable him to drop into Anderson\u0027s private office at any hour during the day without exciting remark. He was careful never to display the least curiosity concerning Anderson\u0027s business, but simply kept his eyes and ears open and picked up what he could. His patience was rewarded at last. One morning as he entered the private office, he found Anderson engaged in tying up a little packet, the significant size and shape of which made Jack\u0027s heart beat faster. \"Remittance day,\" said the indiscreet Anderson carelessly. \"Just wait till I get this off to the boss, and I\u0027ll go out and have a smile with you.\" Jack had instantly made up his mind to follow that packet. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"can\u0027t stop now. Just dropped in to ask you the number of your cigar-maker on lower Sixth avenue. I\u0027ve got to go down in that neighborhood, and I thought I\u0027d get some.\" \"81 Sixth,\" said Anderson. \"Will we lunch to-day?\" \"All right,\" said Jack, \"I\u0027ll be back in time.\" Meanwhile Anderson was writing the address on the packet. Jack after considerable practice had taught himself to read his writing upside down. He now read: \"MR. PETER FEATHERSTONE, Hotel Abercrombie. (To be called for.)\" This was all he required. He bade Anderson good-by, and went out. Having plenty of time, he proceeded in leisurely fashion to the Abercrombie, one of the great hotels in the Thirty-Fourth street district. He was filled with a great hope. \"Please God, I\u0027ll get him this time. I\u0027m safe against recognition in the Pitman disguise. I won\u0027t call on any plainclothes man now, but trust to myself.\" Prudence restrained him from premature rejoicings. \"No counting of chickens this time!\" he warned himself. \"Remember you\u0027re dealing with a customer as slick as an eel. If he slips through your fingers you\u0027ve got to be prepared to begin all over to-morrow!\" In the pillared lobby of the Abercrombie Jack bought a newspaper, and planted himself in a chair in such wise, that while appearing to be absorbed in the news, he could command all that went on at the desk. As he was waiting there little Harmon Evers the wig-maker passed through. Jack, not wishing to be recognized by any one just then, buried himself a little deeper in his newspaper, but Evers stopped beside him, nodding and smiling. His expression approved the Pitman make-up as put on by Jack. \"Couldn\u0027t have done better myself,\" he said. Jack couldn\u0027t help but be flattered. \"One becomes expert with practice,\" he said. \"You\u0027re on your business and I\u0027m on mine,\" Evers said with a sly smile, indicating a little satchel that he carried. \"I didn\u0027t know you had to go out to yours,\" said Jack. \"Oh, yes, there\u0027s an elderly matinee idol lives here, who wouldn\u0027t dare leave his room until I have renovated him. If there was an alarm of fire before I got here, I believe he\u0027d burn up.\" Jack laughed. \"But I see you have serious affairs on your mind. Au revoir. Come down to my place when you can, and we\u0027ll talk philosophy.\" With a nod and a smile he went on to the elevator. Meanwhile Jack had missed nothing of what went on at the desk. In a short while a messenger boy came in carrying the packet he had seen in Anderson\u0027s hands. It was receipted for at the desk and tossed in the pigeonhole marked \"F\" of the division for letters to be called for. For twenty minutes thereafter Jack watched the comedy of \"The Hotel Desk\" being played before him. Unfortunately his mind was at too great a tension to permit him to enjoy the finer shades of comedy. He silently swore at the crowd and the confusion which made it well-nigh impossible for one pair of eyes to follow all that was going on. He concentrated on the letter box marked \"F,\" and watched it until his eyeballs seemed ready to crack. Finally the hand of one of the clerks shot out to that box, and hastily shuffling the contents, picked out the packet again. Jack\u0027s heart gave a jump. He hastily scanned the row in front of the desk at the moment, but there was no figure among them that answered to the descriptions of \"Mr. B.\" At the end of the row was another messenger boy. The clerk handed the packet to him. \"Of course he wouldn\u0027t come himself,\" thought Jack. Jack followed the messenger out of the hotel. Boy-like, he shambled up the street, whistling vociferously, tossing the packet in the air and catching it again, careless of the pedestrians he collided with in his exercise. Presumably had he known the contents he would have treated the packet with greater respect. He turned West in Thirty-Fourth street, stopping to gaze in every window that attracted his attention. Jack was hard put to it to accommodate himself to the snail-like pace without being conspicuous. At the Madison avenue corner an automobile had broken down. The boy hailed this diversion with glee, and Jack, too, had to stand around until the youngster had gazed his fill. Suddenly the boy aimlessly darted across the street like a bird—or a boy, threading his way among the cars hurrying in both directions. Jack almost lost him then. He finally picked him up on the other side, engaged in converse with another messenger. An argument developed and hostilities were threatened. \"I kin lick you wit\u0027 one hand behind me.\" \"You\u0027re anutter!\" \"Want to see me do it?\" \"Ya-ah!\" \"You jus\u0027 say any more and you\u0027ll see!\" \"I ain\u0027t askeered of yeh, yeh big stiff!\" \"You say that again!\" \"Ahh! I dare yeh to touch me! I dare yeh!\" And so on, and so on. Jack, feeling very foolish, had to make out to be studying the pattern of a rug displayed in a nearby window. Anybody who knows boys knows that these discussions are apt to be kept up a long time without getting anywhere. But they end as suddenly as they begin. Having exhausted their powers of repartee they parted, instantly forgetting each other. Jack\u0027s quarry continued around the corner and up Fifth avenue. There were other interruptions; a man was painting a sign; another was dressing a window. Jack almost despaired of arriving at any destination. He wondered if the old man was as impatiently awaiting his packet. Finally it began to rain, and the boy mended his pace a little. He led Jack into the Public Library, and Jack with an accelerated beating of the heart wondered if the rendezvous were here. But the boy went out again by the Forty-Second street door, and it appeared he had only been taking advantage of the long corridors to walk dry shod. The messenger darted across Forty-Second street in his usual reckless style, and Jack found himself back in the vicinity of the Eureka offices. To his astonishment, the boy turned into that very building. Jack went up in the elevator with him. He got put at the fourth floor, and entered the Eureka offices. Jack lingered in the corridor, biting his lips in chagrin. All his trouble amounted to this, that he had been led back to the point he started from. He wondered if it were possible that the seemingly heedless Anderson had turned a clever trick on him. He felt that he had to find out at whatever risk. He had a good excuse to enter, for he had said he would be back. He entered, passing through the outer office into Anderson\u0027s room as he was accustomed to do. Anderson was in the act of receipting for the packet. He greeted Jack without the least departure from his usual careless air, and Jack felt relieved. The boy went out, already pursing up his lips to whistle. It all meant nothing to him. Jack ventured to say with an indifferent air: \"Why, when I left you, you were just sending out a packet like that.\" \"It was the very same package,\" Anderson replied. \"Funny thing, half an hour after I sent it the boss called up again, and said he\u0027d changed his mind and wanted it at the Hotel Madagascar. He never did that before. I sent after it, but the boy was so long coming back, I went to the bank and drew more. \u0027Tain\u0027t healthy to keep the boss waiting too long. I just sent off the second lot.\" \"Madagascar!\" thought Jack. \"My own hotel! He has a nerve. Maybe there\u0027s a chance to get him there!\" \"Ready for lunch?\" asked Anderson. \"Sorry, I can\u0027t go with you to-day,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027ve had a hurry call from the house to go up to Yonkers. Just dropped in to tell you not to wait.\" \"Oh, too bad!\" said Anderson. \"See you to-morrow?\" \"Sure!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61357.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
