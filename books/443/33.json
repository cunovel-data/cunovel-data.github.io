{"id":12428,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 33","content":"With a brief stop at the Madagascar for the purpose mentioned, Jack and his diminutive assistant were carried to the house on Forty-Eighth street. Tommy led the way to the third floor rear. Above the parlor floor no changes had been made in the old-fashioned residence, beyond letting a few panes of glass in the door panels to light the hall. But the door Tommy indicated was of the original solid wood. Jack knocked without receiving any answer. There was no sound of any movement within. \n \n Jack had made up his mind that the boldest way of entering would be the simplest. He therefore sent Tommy in search of a locksmith while he remained silently on guard in the hall. When the workman appeared Jack explained that he had inadvertently locked his keys in his room, and instructed him to pick the lock. When the man set to work, Jack privately dispatched Tommy down into the yard to keep an eye on the rear windows. \n \n Opening the door was no great task. Jack looked inside with a fast beating heart. His first general impression Was of a simply furnished office. He dismissed the locksmith, and recalled Tommy by a signal from the window. \n \n The principal object in the room was an old-fashioned flat-topped desk so placed between the windows that the light would fall over the user\u0027s shoulders. The desk was covered with papers, and the merest glance was enough to show Jack that he had here the conclusive evidence that he had been so long in search of. He decided to call in official help now. There was a telephone on the desk, but he hesitated trusting his secret to it. Instead, he wrote a note to the Deputy Commissioner, asking for two plain clothes men to be sent him at once. This he entrusted to Tommy, instructing him to take a taxicab to police headquarters. \n \n The door was fitted with a spring lock of the usual pattern. It had not been injured, and when the door closed it locked itself. As soon as he was left alone Jack set about making a careful examination of the place. He figured that should the owner return, the sound of the key in the lock would give him sufficient warning. He laid his automatic ready to his hand on the desk. He was careful to make no sound that would warn any one who might stop to listen at the door before entering. \n \n First he took a general survey. The two windows of the room looked out on an array of back yards and on the rear of a long row of similar buildings in the next street. One of the windows opened on a fire escape. At one\u0027s right as one faced the windows was an old-fashioned fireplace: across the room were two doors, the lower giving on the stair hall, the upper presumably on the hall room adjoining. The latter door was screwed to its frame. \n \n At the other end of the room from the windows was a large closet. Jack, fearful of being trapped by the return of the owner merely looked in here. It was set out with a bureau and mirror, and from pegs around the walls depended an extraordinary assortment of clothes. Jack saw that there was a complete separate outfit on each peg; fine clothes and mean, native and foreign; a policeman\u0027s uniform, and a complete turn-out for a woman. Above the pegs a shelf ran around, and over each peg was a box which presumably contained the smaller articles to complete each make-up. \n \n Interesting as was this exhibit, the papers in connection with the desk quickly drew Jack away from it. Behind the desk there was an object which whetted his curiosity to the highest degree. This was an oaken cabinet with drawers of the kind that are used to contain modern card index systems. Jack eagerly pulled out the top drawer. \n \n Inside was a set of large cards, each headed by a name in the usual manner, and with various particulars as to that individual entered beneath. As the scheme became clear to him Jack\u0027s heart beat fast. He could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses. It appeared that he held in his hands a complete record of the operations of \"Mr. B.\" What strange freak of vanity could have led the criminal to collect such a mass of damning evidence! \n \n Here was one card chosen at random. \n \n \n BLAKELY, CHARLES EVANS \n \n Office: Blakely Bros. \u0026 Co., 47 Wall St. \n \n Town house: No. 9 East — St. (Dec. 1st to May 1st.) \n \n Country home: Scarborough-on-Hudson. (Goes up week-ends all year.) \n \n Income: $200,000. (Principally stocks and bonds.) \n \n Personal description: 41 years old; short, fat all over, bald, rosy; known as \"Kewpie Blakely.\" Brown hair and eyes. Wears large, square-cut emerald on left hand pinky. Agent C.D. reports: Blakely is one of the bon vivants of the Millionaires\u0027 Club, a jolly, open-handed, good-natured fellow, enormously popular. Is a well-known collector of Persian faience. Is happily married and has four children, but is reputed to be somewhat gay. N.B. Reports from female agents do not bear this out. Q. reports Blakely employs a body-guard to ride beside him in his car. Says Blakely never walks in the street. Has a watchman in the corridors of his house at night. \n \n \n On the other side of the card was a series of chronological entries, some of which were obscure, though the main story was clear enough. \n \n April 17th 19-- Sent form AA. \n 18th Instructed Anderson to follow up. \n 19th Anderson reports nothing doing. \n 23rd Sent form AB. \n 25th Anderson reports his solicitor \n thrown out of Blakely\u0027s office. \n 26th Instructed Anderson let B. alone for \n present. Sent G. M. to Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s \n with orders to get next to Blakely. \n May 3rd G. M. reports nothing doing. \n Blakely\u0027s in love with his wife. \n 4th Tried a man instead. Instructed J. L. to \n win Blakely\u0027s friendship \n through his love of art. \n June 11th J. L. reports success. Is on intimate \n footing with Blakely. Sent \n J. L. capsule with instructions for \n administering. \n 15th J. L. reports success. Blakely apparently \n very ill. \n 16th Wrote Blakely that he had been \n poisoned, and next time he\u0027d get a \n fatal dose. \n 17th Blakely sent his secretary to Eureka \n Agency to subscribe. \n \n \n The story told by this card was typical. Some of the victims had required more pressure; some had given in easier. Some had fallen behind in their payments, and had required to be \"persuaded\" anew. Two of the cards Jack turned over, those of Ames Benton and Silas Gyde, were significantly underlined: \"Account closed.\" Jack shuddered. \n \n From the card index he turned to the litter of papers on the desk. On top lay a typewritten communication which bore neither address nor signature, but from the contents was unmistakably to be identified as a report from one of \"Mr. B\u0027s\" agents. It read as follows: \n \n \n \"I cannot give you any definite data as to X\u0027s movements around his country place, because his habits are very irregular. He comes out from town sometimes by motor, sometimes by train, and at any hour. Sometimes he stays up in the country for several days at a time, transacting his business over a private telephone wire. \n \n \"I understand he laughs at the idea of danger to himself, and is averse to taking any special precautions. I have learned though, that Mrs. X on her own responsibility has engaged guards to patrol their place very thoroughly. It is well known that the Green Hollow Club where he plays golf has long been guarded by a small army under the guise of \u0027gardeners,\u0027 \u0027green-keepers,\u0027 etc. \n \n \"I have not been able to win the confidence of any of the servants in the country. They\u0027re a crabby lot. It seems Mrs. X has taken them into her confidence regarding a \u0027danger threatening their master\u0027 and they\u0027re all making a great brag of their loyalty, etc. I don\u0027t think anything can be successfully pulled off up there. \n \n \"But here\u0027s a plan. Mr. X sleeps in his town house whenever he is detained late in town. The house is closed of course, and is under the care of two old servants, Tom Monahan and his wife. I learned that Tom was a member of the — district Democratic Club, and I scraped acquaintance with him there. We are now good friends. I have the entrée to the X house (when the master is not there) and can describe it to you fully. \n \n \"Yesterday I was sitting in the kitchen with the Monahans, when I noticed that the house in the next street which backs up against the X house is in the hands of painters and decorators. That gave me my idea. It would be useless to try to enter the X house from the front. Monahan has orders not to admit any one whatsoever while Mr. X is there. But there is a door from the kitchen into the back yard which is never locked except at night. I suppose they think that the high board fence around the yard is sufficient protection. \n \n \"When X spends the night in town, Mrs. Monahan cooks his breakfast for him, and at half past nine (she is very methodical) carries it up to the dining-room and puts it on the steam table. She does not call her master. He comes down when he is ready. Another thing, Mrs. Monahan does not allow her husband in the kitchen while she is cooking. At this hour he will be in the servants\u0027 hall in the front of the basement, reading the paper. \n \n \"Here\u0027s my plan. Let your man go to the house where the painters are at work—it is No. — East 65th Street, and let him ask the boss painter for a job. The painters are working on the fourth and fifth floors now. He\u0027ll be turned down of course, or referred to the office. Now when he comes down-stairs instead of leaving the house, let him go into the dining-room to get the lay of things. The dining-room is the first floor rear. The windows overlook the kitchen and dining-room of the X house. \n \n \"When he sees Mrs. Monahan go up to the dining-room with X\u0027s breakfast, let him slip down-stairs and out through the yard of the vacant house. He will have a good five minutes or more while Mrs. M is arranging the things, etc. He will find plenty of ladders. Let him plant a short ladder against the back fence and drop into the X\u0027s yard. He cannot be seen from the X house unless Mrs. M just happens to be at the dining-room window, which is very unlikely. \n \n \"I will enclose a little plan of the X house. Your man enters from the yard by door A, crosses kitchen and goes out by door Z into passage; opens door C into housemaid\u0027s closet, where he conceals himself until Mrs. M returns to kitchen. He then goes up the stairs D which brings him to the pantry above. There is a swing door into the dining-room. In front of this door is a tall leather screen. If he waits behind this screen until X gets fairly inside the room, he will be between him and the only exit. If X is already in the room he will have him dead to rights. \n \n \"After the accident the chances of your man making a getaway are slim. The entrance hall to the house lies just in front of the dining-room. There are two stairs from the basement. If Monahan runs up through the pantry your man may get out by the front door, if he can open it in time, but if M comes up the front stairs he will meet him in the hall. However, I understood from you that the matter of the getaway was not of the first importance. \n \n \"P.S. I have opened this to add that I have just learned X is booked to speak at the A.B.A. dinner at the Astor on Tuesday night. He will stay in town. If you think my plan is good enough you\u0027ll have to pull the trick Wednesday morning. The next time X stays in town the painters in the vacant house will be finished.\" \n \n Jack sat scowling at this document. Another ghastly assassination scheduled! His skin crawled with horror. How to discover the identity of the victim and warn him in time was the problem. It was planned for Wednesday morning—— \n \n Suddenly Jack sprang to his feet electrified. This was Wednesday morning. And it must be about nine-thirty now! He pulled out his watch with trembling fingers. The hands pointed to twenty minutes past nine. He had ten minutes! And he had yet to find out whom they planned to kill! \n \n He searched frantically among the other papers on the desk for a possible clue. He uncovered a card which had been removed from the index temporarily. A glance at it was sufficient. \n \n DELAMARE, WALTER DE COURCY. \n \n Of course! Delamare had threatened to defy the blackmailers! Delamare\u0027s house was on the North side of East Sixty-fourth Street: Delamare had been the principal speaker at the bankers\u0027 dinner the night before: Jack thought of the man\u0027s fine courage, his humanity, his humor, his unfailing kindness to himself, and turned sick with horror. \n \n \"I have not time!\" he groaned. \n \n He fell on the telephone book. Delamare\u0027s address was not listed there. Like many a prominent man he did not care to subject his home to the annoyance of calls from cranks and strangers. It is useless to ask Information for such numbers. Jack tried the bank but it was before the opening hour and he could get no answer. Meanwhile the precious moments were slipping. \n \n He snatched up his hat, and ran out of the room careless if all his work was destroyed, so he might save his friend. He had to run half a block before he met a taxicab. That took him swiftly enough to Delamare\u0027s house. The inexpressive blind windows told him nothing of what was happening within. It was exactly nine-thirty when he rang the bell. He prayed that Delamare might oversleep to-day. \n \n The door was opened by a middle-aged caretaker, with a somewhat forbidding look, evidently Monahan. \n \n \"I must see Mr. Delamare at once!\" said Jack breathlessly. \n \n \"Not at home. You\u0027ll have to go to his office,\" was the stolid response. \n \n Jack could stand no more. \"Good God, man! His life is threatened. I must warn him!\" \n \n Monahan was sure then that he had a crank to deal with. He barred the way with his great bulk. \"Take yourself off!\" he growled. \"Or I\u0027ll call the police.\" \n \n Jack almost despaired. \"Shut the door and leave me here if you want,\" he said, \"but for God\u0027s sake go to your master quickly. Keep him out of the dining-room until you search it. There\u0027s a murderer hidden there!\" \n \n Monahan\u0027s mind moved slowly. He stood staring at Jack full of sullen suspicion. \n \n \"Go! Go!\" cried Jack. \n \n A shot rang out in the house, seemingly right behind Monahan. \n \n \"Too late!\" cried Jack. \n \n The sound of the shot galvanized the heavy-witted one into action. Turning, he ran from the door, leaving it open. Jack followed him. The dining-room as he already knew adjoined the hall. As Monahan opened the door there was flashed on Jack\u0027s brain the picture of a man standing with a gun in his hand, and another lying face down on the floor. \n \n \"Seize him!\" he cried instinctively. \n \n But at the sound of their coming, the erect man turned, and Jack saw that it was Delamare with face pale but composed. \n \n \"Oh, you\u0027re all right! Thank God!\" cried Jack. The suddenness of the reaction almost unmanned him. He had to support himself against the door frame. \n \n \"You, Robinson?\" said Delamare in a low steady voice. \"Were you warned of this?\" \n \n \"Just ten minutes ago. I came as quickly as I could.\" \n \n \"Do you know him?\" asked Delamare pointing to the figure on the floor. \n \n \"I think so. Turn him over.\" \n \n Monahan obeyed, and as Jack had expected, he saw the livid, drawn face of the half mad youth he had tried to befriend. The eyes were closed. \n \n Jack nodded. \"His name is Berg. Is he dead?\" \n \n Delamare shook his head smiling. \"Not much. Stunned only. I cracked him on the head with his own gun. He had no strength.\" \n \n A wave of compassion swept over Jack. \"Poor devil! Poor devil!\" he murmured. \"He isn\u0027t the real criminal!\" \n \n \"I expect not,\" said Delamare. \n \n Jack suddenly became aware of a dark stain spreading on Delamare\u0027s coat sleeve above the elbow. \"You\u0027re wounded!\" he cried. \n \n \"Nothing serious. A flesh wound. I can move my arm freely.\" \n \n \"You must have a doctor.\" \n \n \"All right. Monahan, telephone for Doctor McArdle. Then for the police.\" \n \n By this time Berg\u0027s eyes were open. He was muttering incoherently, and rolling his head from side to side on the floor. As Monahan was leaving the room, Jack was struck by an idea. \n \n \"Wait a minute!\" he said. To Delamare: \"If I might make a suggestion——?\" \n \n \"Go ahead.\" \n \n \"Couldn\u0027t we keep this affair to ourselves for the present?\" \n \n \"Certainly, if it will further your plans.\" \n \n \"This young fellow is mad—or the next thing to it. If we could put him in the hands of a good brain specialist, and have his senses restored by proper treatment, he might make an invaluable witness against the man we really want.\" \n \n \"Good!\" said Delamare. \"We\u0027ll call Doctor Watkins Kent. Monahan, never mind the police. First call Doctor McArdle, and say I have had a slight accident. Say no more than that. Then call Doctor Watkins Kent. Say that Mr. Delamare presents his compliments, and wants to know if he can make it convenient to come to his house at once on a matter of importance.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61368.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
