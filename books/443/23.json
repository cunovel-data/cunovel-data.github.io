{"id":12418,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"While he descended in the elevator Jade thought quickly. His thoughts were not altogether pleasant ones. Evidently \"Mr. B.\" or one of his agents had seen him watching in the Abercrombie and had taken warning. If this were so his disguise had been seen through. Jack did not so much mind the fact that his adversary had given him the slip again, but he had counted heavily on that disguise. And now the whole structure that he had built upon it was crumbling. But he was far from being discouraged. \"Mr. B.\" had had the nerve to choose the Madagascar. Very well, he would try to call his bluff there. Since it was his own hotel he didn\u0027t have to waste the time to get there. He could telephone ahead. He hastened to the nearest booth. He got the desk at the Madagascar. Establishing the fact that the voice on the wire was that of Baldwin, a clerk well known to him, he said: \"This is Robinson speaking, Mr. Norman\u0027s secretary. Do you recognize my voice?\" \"Yes, sir, certainly, Mr. Robinson.\" \"Listen carefully. There\u0027s a crook trying to pull a little game on Mr. Norman, and I\u0027ve framed up a plant to get him with the goods. Do you get me?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"There\u0027s just been a package delivered to the desk there, or will be delivered in a few minutes addressed to Mr. Peter Featherstone, to be called for. No, wait a minute! That name may have been changed—but I\u0027m sure about the package. It\u0027s a small flat package the size and shape of a bundle of greenbacks laid flat. It\u0027s wrapped in a sheet of white typewriter paper, and tied with a green string. Look and see if you have such a package there now. I\u0027ll hold the wire.\" Presently the answer came: \"Yes, sir, we have such a package, but it\u0027s addressed to Mr. Amos Tewkesbury.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Jack. \"The name doesn\u0027t signify. Now I want you to keep Connolly the house detective within call, and have him arrest, as quietly as possible, whoever calls for that package. Keep the man in the room behind the office until I can get there. I\u0027ll go in by the side door and telephone down to you from our suite. Is that all clear?\" \"Perfectly, sir.\" Jack hailed a taxi and had himself carried home, that is to say to Kate\u0027s house, where Mr. Pitman had his ostensible domicile. It was not the sober Mr. Pitman\u0027s habit to employ taxis, but this was an urgent case. Jack had to remove the Pitman make-up, of course, before he could show himself around the Madagascar. He hastily changed to the more elegant attire of the millionaire\u0027s secretary, and then made his way through the vault into Silas Gyde\u0027s old rooms, thence across the corridor to the rear of the state apartments. Something less than half an hour had elapsed since he had called up Baldwin. Bobo was there, moping in a dressing-gown while he waited for lunch time, the only thing that relieved his heavy hours. He brightened a little at the sight of some one to whom he might pour out his troubles. \"I wish I were dead!\" he groaned. Jack was in no mood to listen to him then. He ran to the telephone, and snatched the receiver from the hook. \"What\u0027s up?\" said Bobo, infected with his excitement. \"Give me Mr. Baldwin at the desk,\" Jack said to the operator. \"Hello, Baldwin. This is Robinson. Have you got my man?\" \"Yes, sir, we\u0027ve got him all right!\" \"Thank God! Have him quietly brought up here.\" Jack hung up the receiver and did a go-as-you-please around the Dutch room, hurdling the chairs. Bobo gazed at him goggle-eyed. \"What on earth——!\" \"I\u0027ve got him!\" cried Jack. \"I\u0027ve got him! I did it with my own little wits. Once too often he tried to fool me! He was just a little too nervy trying to pull something in my own hotel!\" \"Got who? The old man himself!\" cried Bobo amazed. \"Joy and deliverance!\" sang Jack. \"All honest millionaires can now sleep easy o\u0027 nights!\" \"But what\u0027s going to become of me now?\" said poor Bobo. Jack\u0027s transports were interrupted by a ring at the outer door of the suite. He ran to it and flung it open. Bitter disappointment awaited him. It was not the famous, much-desired \"Mr. B\" that he saw outside nor was it a figure that could possibly have taken his shape. Connolly, the house detective, had his huge hand on the shoulder of a slinking, weedy youth with sallow vacuous face, and cigarette stained fingers; in other words, the typical loafer of the Times Square neighborhood. Baldwin was behind the pair, eager to see what would happen. \"Oh, that\u0027s not my man!\" cried Jack. There was an awkward silence. \"I followed your instructions to the letter,\" said Baldwin, eager to justify himself. \"You said to arrest any man that asked for that package. This man asked for it.\" \"Sure,\" said Jack quickly. \"You did right. I\u0027m disappointed, that\u0027s all.\" \"I haven\u0027t done anything,\" whined the prisoner. \"What are you going to do to me?\" \"Shall I let him go, sir?\" boomed Connolly. Jack roused himself. \"Not on your life,\" he said. \"He\u0027s got to give an account of himself. Bring him in and shut the door.\" To the weedy youth he said: \"Who sent you here?\" The answer came voluble and craven: \"I don\u0027t know who the guy was. I never seen him before. Honest, I didn\u0027t know there was anything crooked in it. I\u0027m no crook, boss.\" \"Describe the man who sent you here.\" The answer came readily: \"A medium old guy, stoutish, not real fat. Had his hair brushed in a funny way, old-fashioned-like, and a little chin whisker.\" \"That\u0027s my man!\" said Jack grimly. \"Where did you meet him?\" \"I was standin\u0027 in front of the pitcher theater on Seventh below Forty-Second with some other fellows when a big black limousine car came along and stopped at the curb. We all took notice of it, it was such a long car, long as an ambulance. The door opened a little way, and an old guy leaned out and held up a finger to me. \"He asks me if I want to earn a dollar, and I says sure. So he tells me to go to the desk of the Madagascar, and ask for a package for Mr. Amos Tewkesbury, and bring it to him. But he said he wouldn\u0027t be in the car when I got back. He said he\u0027d be standing on the northwest corner of Forty-Second Street and Seventh, and I wasn\u0027t to stop when I saw him, but just slip him the package, and take the dollar he\u0027d be holding in his hand. That\u0027s all. I didn\u0027t see no wrong in it.\" \"Maybe he\u0027s lying, sir,\" said Connolly. Jack shook his head. \"Sounds like my man,\" he said. \"What\u0027ll I do with him, sir?\" \"Let him have the package and let him go,\" said Jack. To the prisoner he said sternly: \"Your story may be true, but this is an ugly business you\u0027ve mixed yourself up in. You\u0027d have a hard time proving your innocence in court. The only way you can square yourself is by helping us pinch this crook.\" The sallow youth turned a shade paler. \"He\u0027s stronger than me, and he\u0027s heeled,\" he muttered. \"I don\u0027t want you to lay hands on him. I\u0027ll take care of that. You follow your instructions just as he gave them to you. Hand him the package without stopping. Go quickly, and don\u0027t look behind you.\" To Connolly Jack said: \"Take a taxi to the corner of Eighth and Forty-Second, and walk back on Forty-Second. You\u0027ve heard the description of the man I want, and the car he rides in. If he gives me the slip, and tries to escape towards the West, nab him.\" It was still raining. Jack snatched up an umbrella and, opening it with his penknife, made a little triangular cut midway in the silk. \"My disguise,\" he said. The sallow youth, clasping the package, hurried out of the hotel with Jack at his heels. Jack raised the umbrella and held it low over his head. Thus while his face was hidden from the passersby, he could still see ahead through the little hole. The stretch of pavement between the Madagascar and Forty-Second street was as thronged as it is twenty hours out of the twenty-four, even in the rain. They had crossed Forty-Third street and were within two hundred feet of the appointed place. Jack was peering eagerly ahead through his peep-hole, when suddenly his umbrella was knocked sideways, and a clawlike hand clutched his wrist. A cracked voice squalled: \"Stop him! He snatched my pocketbook!\" It was a bent little old woman in a queer rusty bonnet over a brown wig. She wore glasses so thick, that her eyes were like little points far behind them. She redoubled her cries. \"He\u0027s a thief! He stole my pocketbook!\" Jack crimsoned with anger and mortification. He was helpless. To knock the old woman out of the way would only have been to convict himself of her preposterous charge. In five seconds a great crowd was pushing and shoving around them. \"All my money! All my money!\" wailed the old woman, and actually two tears rolled down her withered cheeks. It was the perfection of acting. A loud murmur of sympathy went up from the crowd, and violent threats were made in Jack\u0027s face. He ground his teeth in impotent rage. Anything he might have said would only have made matters worse. He retained the presence of mind to keep his mouth shut. \"Hold him!\" cried the old woman. \"I\u0027ll get a policeman!\" Half a dozen pairs of hands seized Jack roughly. The old woman threaded her way with surprising celerity through the crowd. Jack permitted himself to say: \"You\u0027ll never see her again. It\u0027s a frame-up to let her and her partner make a getaway.\" \"Shut up, you thief!\" they roared. \"Shut up, or we\u0027ll smash your hat over your eyes.\" Those behind who had little idea of what was going on roared out of sympathy. But the temper of a crowd is subject to abrupt changes. A minute passed and the old woman did not return. It suddenly struck the people that the well-dressed Jack, proud, angry and silent, did not much resemble a purse-snatcher. Jack, feeling the change, said scornfully: \"Do you see her coming back? I tell you it\u0027s a frame-up.\" The men who had hold of Jack became uncertain, and finally let go. Jack elbowed his way out, and none sought to stop him now. The crowd dissolved. The whole incident had occupied less than two minutes, but that was long enough to do the mischief. The packet presumably had been handed over, and both messenger and principal swallowed up. Jack hastened over the remaining distance to the corner of Forty-Second street. Neither the sallow youth nor the old gentleman with the imperial was visible of course. Jack hesitated at a loss which way to turn. There was a chance that the old man, having received the money, had turned Westward and so might be intercepted by Connolly, but it was a faint one. While Jack stood there the traffic officer at that important crossing gave the signal for the East and West-bound traffic to cross, and a double line of cars darted across Seventh Avenue. Fourth in the line of those bound East Jack saw the long black limousine that had been so often described to him. As it flashed by he had a glimpse of a silk-hatted head with gray hair brushed forward of the ears, ruddy complexion, gray moustache and imperial. Alongside was the rusty black bonnet and the brown wig. The man\u0027s head was down, and his attitude suggested he was counting something in his lap. The woman\u0027s glance followed his. It was Jack\u0027s first glimpse of his quarry, and his hunting instinct was spurred to action. He made a zig-zag dash across the street under the very wheels of motors and trolley cars. The black limousine was out of his reach, but by great good luck he found a taxicab standing by the curb with its engine running. He flung himself in, crying: \"Four times your fare if you can keep that car in sight. A hundred dollars if I am able to arrest the couple in it!\" The taxi leaped ahead. Jack lowered the front window, and leaning forward, pointed out the right car to the chauffeur. In a wild spurt down Forty-Second street they gained half a block on the limousine. They just managed to get across Sixth avenue before the whistle blew. At Fifth the whole line was held up for perhaps half a minute. The press was so great here, Jack could not see the black car, but he had carefully marked its position, about six cars ahead. When the whistle blew for the East and West traffic to resume they saw it turn down Fifth with a burst of speed. They followed. In and out of the close traffic the big car threaded its way with a wonderful exhibition of sang-froid on the part of the chauffeur. Jack had a good chauffeur too. But a race through such a crowd is purely a matter of luck. They never succeeded in getting within less than five car lengths of their prize. Jack saw that the black car now bore a Georgia license. He made note of the number. At Thirty-Fourth street the line was held up again. The whistle had just blown, and this promised to be a longer stoppage. Jack jumped out of the taxi, and ran ahead down the line with fast beating heart. The black limousine was empty. Jack gritted his teeth. \"The devil\u0027s own luck favors him,\" he thought. \"They must have left the car during the block on Forty-Second.\" The chauffeur had not seen him. Jack did not approach him, thinking it better to take a chance of following him to his garage. The line got in motion again, and Jack swung himself aboard his taxi as it passed. At Twenty-Eighth street the whistle blew just as the black car was crossing. It continued blithely down the avenue, the chauffeur waggling a derisive hand outside his car. Jack would have risked defying the whistle, but his way was effectually blocked by other cars in front and on both sides. \"My luck again!\" he groaned. They were held up there while a ten-horse truck bearing a steel girder crawled across the Avenue. When the whistle gave them leave to move again, the limousine had disappeared into a side street. They saw it no more. Jack had the license number, but an investigation instituted by telegraph only proved as he expected, that that number had been issued to some one giving a mythical address in Atlanta. As for notifying the New York police, he knew very well that within half an hour the license tags on the black limousine would be changed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61358.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
