{"id":12423,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"The Columbian set sail early on a Friday morning. On Monday Jack received the following telegram: \n \n \n Charleston, S.C. \n \n Came in here last night for coal. At daylight sick man discovered to be missing. Must have climbed through port hole and dropped into waiting boat. Wireless operator gone too. Captain thinks he was bribed by wireless to liberate B. Have discovered that the two of them took the Southern train North late last night. Wire instructions. \n \n Lizzie Regan. \n \n \n Jack thought swiftly: \"Late train North from Charleston last night. That would bring them here late to-night. Bobo would telegraph Miriam of course. She may go to meet him.\" \n \n He jumped to the telephone, and calling up the Bienvenu, got Starr on the wire. \n \n \"This is Robinson—at the Hotel Madagascar, you know.\" \n \n \"Yes, Mr. Robinson?\" \n \n \"Is Miss Culbreth still in your hotel?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir, but she\u0027s leaving. She just telephoned down for her bill to be made out.\" \n \n \"Could you arrange to have her followed when she leaves?\" \n \n \"Yet, sir, I have a smart boy here who can be depended on.\" \n \n \"Good! If she goes to the Pennsylvania station that\u0027s all right. I will be there. But if she goes elsewhere have a message telephoned to this hotel for me.\" \n \n \"Very good, sir. I will see to it.\" \n \n Jack hastened into Kate\u0027s house and assumed the Pitman make-up. It had outlived its usefulness so far as the old man was concerned, but he had no reason to suppose that he had ever been pointed out to Miriam in that character. At any rate he had no other disguise handy. With a brief good-by to Kate he taxied to the Pennsylvania terminal. All travelers to the South use this station. \n \n Miriam was already there, walking impatiently up and down the concourse. She was heavily veiled, but even so was a sufficiently notable figure. Jack was beginning to be acquainted with her wardrobe, extensive as that was. To-day she was wearing a green hat and black furs that he had seen before. \n \n When the gates were opened for the 10:08 Washington express she went through. Jack bought a ticket for Washington and followed. Supposing that she would ride in a parlor car, he got in a coach, as he did not care to subject Mr. Pitman\u0027s disguise to a five hours\u0027 scrutiny on the train. \n \n After the train had started, he showed his police credentials to the conductor, and describing Miriam, asked to be informed to what point her ticket had been taken. Word was brought him later that it was to Baltimore. He asked to be told if she got off before that. \n \n But Miriam apparently had no suspicion that she was being followed. In Baltimore she went openly to the Hotel Warwick and registered under own name—or rather, under the name that Jack knew her by. The so-called Mr. Pitman was close behind her. \n \n After putting her bag in her room she reappeared unveiled, and started to walk downtown at a leisurely pace, Mr. Pitman still in unsuspected attendance. He heard her ask a policeman the way to the City Hall. In that building she asked at the Information desk where marriage licenses were to be procured. \n \n Jack smiled to himself. \"License number two!\" he thought. He did not risk discovery by following her through the unfrequented corridors, but waited within watch of the main entrance for her to reappear. \n \n For the next hour Miriam killed time in Charles Street, the fashionable shopping thoroughfare. She visited several hat shops, and presumably \"tried on.\" Mr. Pitman could not very well follow her into such places. Later a tea room held her for another half hour. At some time during these peregrinations she must have become aware that she was being followed. \n \n Leaving the tea room she hailed a taxi, and ordered the chauffeur to take her to the Hotel Minnert. Jack followed in another cab. When he saw that the hotel was only around the corner, he began to suspect a ruse. She entered by the Ladies\u0027 door, and he was less than half a minute behind her. She was not visible inside. From the doorman he learned that she had walked upstairs. He followed. \n \n On the next floor there were no public rooms but only endless corridors with bedrooms opening off. There was not a soul in sight and he hesitated which way to turn. Finally a chambermaid appeared around a corner, and a piece of silver procured him information. \n \n \"Yes, sir, she just went down the corridor on the right. She asked me if there was another stairs, and I told her yes, at the end of that corridor.\" \n \n Jack hastened in the direction named. At the foot of the rear stairs he found a door giving on a quiet back street. The door-keeper supplied the next link of information. \n \n \"Yes, sir, there was a taxi waiting for her. She just drove away.\" \n \n \"Hm!\" thought Jack ruefully, \"that\u0027s a good one on me! Either she knows this place of old, or else she fixed it up on the way with the taxi-driver.\" \n \n He was not greatly concerned by this mishap, for he knew the time the Southern train was due to arrive in Baltimore, and he expected to meet her again there. The time was six-thirty. He spent the interim in buying himself an overcoat of striking cut, and a tweed hat that would pull down low on his head. These articles changed his appearance not a little. On the way uptown he stopped in at the Warwick, but Miriam had not returned there. \n \n When he got to the station Miriam was not to be seen among the crowd. The train was forty-five minutes late. Informing himself as to which gate the passengers would be discharged through, he took a seat commanding it, and affected to busy himself with a magazine. \n \n As the time for the coming of the train drew near, and no Miriam showed up, a sharp anxiety attacked him. He wondered if he could have erred in his calculations. He knew she had not had time since he lost her, to telegraph down the line for Bobo to get off at Washington. \n \n The train drew in, and the passengers began mounting the steps. Still no sign of Miriam. But suddenly Jack caught sight of Bobo among the passengers and his spirits rebounded. \n \n \"Is she going to let me carry him off?\" he wondered. \n \n The wireless operator accompanied Bobo, and Bobo was clad in one of his uniforms. As there was about thirty pounds difference in weight between the two—in Bobo\u0027s favor, the plump youth cut rather a comic figure, and was acutely conscious of the fact. \n \n As they reached the top of the stairs, a lady clad in deep mourning with a thick black veil concealing her whole head and face stepped forward and laid her hand on Bobo\u0027s arm. At first Bobo shrank back from this sable apparition, but she pushed the veil aside sufficiently for him to see her face, and he grinned from ear to ear. \n \n \"You fool!\" said Jack to himself. \"Not to have seen through that!\" \n \n Miriam and the two young men went quickly down the way to the side entrance of the station. Jack was not far behind them. In that confusion of people there was little danger of their spotting him. Outside among the waiting automobiles was a big Macklin touring car, and Miriam led the two men towards it. Jack swore at himself again. \n \n \"She had the wit to hire a special car, while you have to trust to a taxi!\" \n \n He jumped in a taxi. \"Follow that Macklin car that\u0027s just turning out,\" he said. \"Ten dollars bonus, if you stick to it.\" \n \n The touring car did not turn South towards the center of town, but headed North by the bridge over the railway tracks. At the first wide street, North avenue, Jack read on the street lamps, it turned East, then North again on another wide thoroughfare which finally brought them out into the country. \n \n \"Double fare outside the City limits,\" the chauffeur said laconically. \n \n \"Let her go,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027m good for it.\" \n \n A short turn through a lane brought them to another main highway. \n \n \"Belair Road,\" said the chauffeur, \"main road to the North.\" \n \n \"Have you a full tank?\" asked Jack. \n \n He nodded. \n \n \"Follow them to New York then if necessary!\" \n \n On this dark road the occupants of the touring car soon discovered that they were being followed. They put on speed. \n \n \"Give her all she\u0027ll take,\" said Jack. \n \n Fortunately the taxi was of a good make, and the engine was tight and clean. The little car gave a good account of itself. Moreover the road was smoothly paved, which further helped equalize the chances of light car and heavy one. Pursued and pursuer roared down the dark highway with cut-outs open. For several miles the way lay over one steep hill after another. They precipitated themselves recklessly down each declivity, gaining a momentum at the bottom that carried them almost to the top again without slackening. \n \n \"This is faster than I\u0027m allowed to run her,\" said Jack\u0027s chauffeur. \n \n \"That\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll be responsible for the damage.\" \n \n The man grinned and stepped a little harder on his accelerator. \n \n At first the big Macklin car set up a pace they were unable to match, but apparently the driver was unfamiliar with the road, and after he had narrowly escaped flinging his car in the ditch on several sharp turns, he was compelled to slow down somewhat. This gave them an even chance. They kept about a hundred feet behind the red eye of the tail-light ahead. \n \n \"We\u0027re holding them all right,\" said Jack\u0027s chauffeur. \n \n The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there came a report like a small field piece beneath them. \n \n \"Damn that tire!\" cried the man. \n \n \"There goes Bobo\u0027s last chance of salvation!\" said Jack. \n \n The blow-out had been heard in the car ahead. They swept out of sight around a bend tooting their horn triumphantly. \n \n It took them the usual half an hour to change tires. \n \n \"Back to town I suppose,\" said the driver when he was ready to start again. \n \n \"No!\" said Jack. \"They might blow up a tire, too. Keep on!\" \n \n In a village called Kingsville they stopped long enough to make sure that the Macklin car was still ahead of them. At the next place, Belair, they came upon it resting demurely in front of a dwelling. Since there was a church next door, it was not difficult to guess that this house was a parsonage. \n \n \"I thought so,\" said Jack grimly. \n \n He jumped out and rang the bell. When the door was opened by a maid there was no need for him to make any inquiry. Through an open archway he could see into the living-room of the house. Bobo and Miriam were standing hand in hand before the parson with his book. Even as Jack looked, he finished pronouncing the benediction, and the couple turned around. Miriam had evidently left her woeful headgear in the car outside. She was wearing the dashing green hat again. \n \n Jack, forgetting for the moment that he was disguised, stepped into the room. Bobo did not know him, but Miriam did. Her face lighted up with a wicked triumph. \n \n \"What a pity you were late!\" she said with mocking sweetness, \"I would so much have liked you to be present!\" \n \n \"What—who—who\u0027s this?\" stammered Bobo. \n \n \"This is Jack. All dressed up! Don\u0027t you recognize his beautiful eyes?\" \n \n Bobo saw that it was Jack, turned pale, and looked furtively about him for a way out, in case things went suddenly against him. \n \n \"Be the first to congratulate me,\" said Miriam to Jack. \"Most of all I want to hear it from you.\" \n \n Poor Bobo in his skin-tight uniform was an absurd figure of a bridegroom. With humble eyes, he was mutely imploring Jack not to give him away. \n \n Jack had no intention of doing so. Knowing himself to be the real master of the situation, he could well afford to put up with the girl\u0027s outrageous triumphant air. \n \n Jack\u0027s smile irritated her. She lost her joyful look. The commoner aspect of her broke through. \"I\u0027m Mrs. Norman,\" she said with a disagreeable laugh. She displayed her wedding-ring. \"You can\u0027t get around that! Remember it, the next time you start out to get the better of me.\" \n \n \"Miriam, for God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t provoke him!\" whispered poor Bobo. \n \n \"Provoke him!\" she said, raising her voice. \"You seem strangely afraid of hurting the feelings of your secretary. He needs to be provoked. He\u0027s too big for his shoes! Let him understand that I\u0027m the mistress now, and his chance of keeping his job depends on his pleasing me!\" \n \n Bobo almost fainted. \n \n Jack met her eyes squarely. \"All right, my lady!\" he was thinking. \"My turn will come later!\" He foresaw that his game in the future would be furthered if he appeared to submit. So he bowed—but he could not quite iron out the mocking smile. \n \n \"I only aim to please!\" said he. \n \n Miriam looked at him suspiciously. \n \n \"What do you wish me to do, Mr. Norman?\" he asked Bobo. \n \n To that youth it was like a ray of light breaking through. He lifted his eyes to Jack with a kind of sheeplike gratitude. But he seemed incapable of speech. \n \n Miriam answered for him. \"Go back to New York, and wait for us at the Madagascar.\" \n \n Jack bowed again, and returned to his taxi. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61363.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
