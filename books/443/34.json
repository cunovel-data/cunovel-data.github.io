{"id":12429,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 34","content":"Jack, remembering the critical stage at which he had left matters in Forty-Eighth street, did not wait for the doctors, but left Berg in Mr. Delamare\u0027s care, and hastened back. He found that Tommy and the two plainclothes men had arrived in the meantime, but finding him gone, they were hanging around outside the door of the room, at a loss what to do. This time they broke in the door without ado. At his first glance inside Jack saw that the room had been visited. Though he had been away but little more than half an hour, a clean sweep had been made of the cards and papers. A still smoldering fire in the grate showed the manner of their disposal. The window on the fire escape was open. \"He was inside when you got here!\" cried Jack. \"He heard you outside. Now he\u0027s given us the slip again. Why didn\u0027t you watch the back windows!\" The city detectives looked distinctly aggrieved. The spokesman for the pair said: \"How did we know what your game was?\" \"You knew!\" said Jack to Tommy. Tommy hung his head. \"When I came back, and found you gone, I didn\u0027t know rightly what to do,\" he muttered. Jack saw that it was really nobody\u0027s fault. \"Oh, well, we\u0027ll have to try again,\" he said. \"You should have called on us sooner,\" said the principal detective condescendingly. \"Sorry, I didn\u0027t,\" said Jack dryly. The other missed the note of irony. \"Well, lay out your case to us now, and we\u0027ll give you some experienced advice.\" Somehow the manner of this well-meaning gentleman did not inspire Jack with overmuch confidence as to his perspicacity. Moreover, since his man and his evidence were both gone, he saw nothing to be gained by consulting the police. \"I\u0027m not quite ready to do that,\" he said good-naturedly. \"Sorry to have troubled you for nothing.\" The two detectives exchanged a look of scorn. \"These amateurs think they know it all!\" it said. Only the fact that they knew Jack was a great man\u0027s secretary, and therefore a person to be propitiated, restrained them from audible comment. However, when they found that Jack was disposed to reward them liberally, they changed their opinion of him. Ten dollar bills are wonderful sweeteners. \"How about me?\" asked Tommy anxiously. \"Back to the mines,\" said Jack. \"In other words, 1118 Broadway.\" Tommy\u0027s face fell piteously. \"Mind you,\" said Jack quickly. \"I\u0027m not blaming you for our failure. You did wonderful work. I\u0027ll send for you when the trail gets hot again.\" He likewise presented Tommy with a green testimonial of his appreciation. Before any of them got out of the room the telephone bell most surprisingly rang. They all stopped and stared at the instrument as if they expected an apparition to issue from the mouthpiece. \"Wait!\" said Jack. \"Perhaps there\u0027s something here.\" He took down the receiver. \"Hello,\" he said ingratiatingly. The reply came in a tone no less dulcet: \"How do you do, Mr. Robinson.\" Jack almost dropped the receiver. \"Why—what—who—\" he stammered. He heard a light laugh on the wire. \"You are surprised. But I was sure I would find you there.\" \"Who is this?\" asked Jack sparring for time—he knew very well. \"Need you ask?\" replied the mocking voice. \"This is the owner of the desk at which you are now seated.\" Jack said to himself, \"Mustn\u0027t let him think he\u0027s putting it over you!\" He answered in the same mocking tone. \"How do you do. So glad you called me up.\" Clapping a hand over the transmitter, he whispered swiftly to the leading detective: \"This is the man. Trace the call back. If he\u0027s anywhere near, get him. I\u0027ll keep him talking.\" The detective took a note of the number on the transmitter, and ran out followed by Tommy. Meanwhile the voice on the wire was saying: \"Sorry I was out when you called.\" \"Very glad to wait until you can get back,\" said Jack. \"That\u0027s nice of you. But I\u0027m mighty sorry, I\u0027ve been called out of town.\" As on a former occasion Jack\u0027s recollection was vaguely stirred by something familiar in the man\u0027s voice. He supposed that this was the man who had appeared as Comrade Wilde the night before, but as Wilde had not spoken aloud within Jack\u0027s hearing, it must have been on some other occasion he had heard this voice. But he could not place it. When the exchange of ironical civilities began to pall, Jack asked politely: \"What can I do for you, Mr. B.?\" \"I just wanted a little chat with you. I wanted to congratulate you on your game.\" \"Thanks!\" \"It\u0027s been a mighty interesting game that you and I have been playing the last few weeks; a sort of chess game with human pawns, eh?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Well, you\u0027ve won. You have checkmated me.\" \"Do you mind telling me what you mean by that exactly?\" \"I have quit. Burned my records as you see; closed up Anderson and the other agencies; paid off and called in all my operatives.\" \"Going to retire on your winnings, eh?\" \"Quite so,\" was the calm reply. \"But do me the credit of believing that it was not the money I was playing for, but the joy of the game. It was a great game! For three years I have pitted myself single-handed against the combined wealth of this country. I have taken my toll of the millionaires, and not all the power that wealth commands was able to stop me!\" \"True enough,\" said Jack grimly. \"I could admire you myself, if you had only left murder out of your calculations.\" The man at the other end of the wire chose to ignore the ugly word. He resumed: \"I\u0027m counting on the fact that your head is strong enough not to be turned by what I\u0027m telling you.\" \"I don\u0027t quite get you there,\" said Jack. \"In other words you\u0027re too good a man I hope, to be unduly puffed up by the fact that I salute you as the victor, and retire from the game. You will not be foolish enough to think that you have me altogether at your mercy.\" \"Oh, I hope I know a good player myself when I see one.\" \"Good! Then you will be content with your victory, which I assure you is no mean one for a man of your years. So long as you have stopped me you will not feel that it is necessary to your triumph to have me apprehended.\" \"Oh, I didn\u0027t say that,\" Jack answered quickly. \"I should have to consider that carefully. I couldn\u0027t promise anything offhand.\" \"Promise?\" said the voice quickly, with a touch of pique. \"I want no promise. It is nothing to me what you decide. I like you for your sportsmanlike qualities, and therefore I give you fair warning. It is for your own good that I suggest you go no further.\" \"Much obliged,\" said Jack dryly, \"I\u0027ll consider it.\" There was still pique in the voice. \"Don\u0027t get a swelled head, my young friend. It is fatal to clever youths. I\u0027ve been playing with you the last few weeks. It amused me to see how near I could let you come to me, and still evade you. But if I wished to keep out of your way, you could never get within miles of me!\" \"Then why bother about the matter?\" \"Because I am tired of the chase. I\u0027m going to settle down into a nice hum-drum life of respectability. I\u0027m not going to put myself to the trouble of running away from you.\" \"And if I should still keep after you?\" \"I\u0027d be awfully sorry,\" drawled the voice, \"but I should really have to put a quietus on you. I could, you know. I\u0027ve had a dozen chances within the past ten days.\" Jack had no reason to doubt the truth of the last statement. He shivered a little. After all, life was sweet. \"I should hate to do it,\" the voice went on, \"you\u0027re too good a sport.\" \"Much obliged,\" put in Jack. \"But I\u0027d have no choice, really. I must have rest. My doctor orders it.\" Jack smiled grimly at the thought of a crook threatened with nervous prostration as a result of overwork. These are rapid times that we live in! He cast about in his mind for the means to prolong the conversation. \"How do I know you\u0027re on the square?\" he asked. \"About quitting, I mean.\" \"Go see your friend Anderson to-morrow. You\u0027ll find him closed up. Mail your employer\u0027s check to the Eureka Protective Association. It will be returned to you by the post-office.\" It seemed wise to Jack to appear to fall in with the other\u0027s suggestions. \"I appreciate your friendliness in warning me,\" he said. \"Do you mind if I ask you a question or two. Just natural, human curiosity, you know.\" \"Ask them and I\u0027ll see.\" \"How did you know I had been here in your office when you came. I had disturbed nothing.\" \"Perhaps I was there myself at the time.\" \"Impossible! I made sure of that.\" The laugh sounded again. \"Nothing is impossible! Think it over!\" \"What first put you on to the fact that I was after you?\" \"Oh, you want to know too much,\" was the laughing reply. \"Answer me a question.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"What first made you suspect the Eureka Association?\" \"Mr. Gyde left his heir a statement of their dealings with him.\" \"Hm! I never thought of that possibility.\" \"Now answer my question.\" \"You\u0027d like to keep me here, wouldn\u0027t you, until you have time to trace this call back, and send a man to nab me. Sorry I can\u0027t oblige. I\u0027m at Grand Central and my train is leaving. Good-bye!\" The detective had not sufficient time, of course, to get his man. Oddly enough the humorous \"Mr. B\" had told the truth as to where he was. The call had come from the Grand Central station.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61369.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
