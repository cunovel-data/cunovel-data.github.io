{"id":12431,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"Bobo and the lovely Miriam arrived at the Madagascar next morning. Miriam promptly sallied forth to Miss Staley\u0027s to pick a maid, giving Jack and Bobo an opportunity to have a long talk undisturbed. When Bobo learned that Jack\u0027s new plans included unlimited funds for himself for the time being, he hastened to agree to everything. Jack rehearsed him carefully in the part he was to play. The principal danger was that Bobo in his enthusiasm might overdo it. \n \n \"For Heaven\u0027s sake don\u0027t look so smug and expectant,\" said Jack, \"or she\u0027ll smell a rat before we begin!\" \n \n Bobo, it should be mentioned, knew nothing of the part Kate was to play. Bobo had never seen Kate. \n \n Miriam returned successful from her quest, and so far as such a great lady might deign to her slaves, almost good-tempered. \n \n \"Yes, I found a girl,\" she said languidly. \"Quite a superior creature. Her name is Mary Dean. She has worked for Mrs. Walter Delamare and Mrs. Willis Estabrook. She\u0027ll be here with her things in time to dress me for dinner.\" \n \n Mary Dean was the name chosen by Kate. \"So far so good,\" thought Jack. \n \n The three of them lunched together in the Dutch room of their suite. Bobo as the meal progressed, became visibly nervous, and scarcely did justice to the timbales of chicken and asparagus tips. Jack watching him, and fearful that Miriam might notice something, gave him the sign to open the comedy, though he had intended to wait until after the meal. \n \n \"I want some more money,\" said Bobo. \n \n \"Huh!\" said Miriam scornfully. \"One would think it was his money you were asking for.\" \n \n This put Bobo out a little; Jack hastened to give him the next cue. \"But I\u0027ve been sending you a thousand a week.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s a thousand a week!\" said Miriam. \"Our bill at the Rodney Farms was half of that.\" \n \n \"Why didn\u0027t you buy the place?\" queried Jack sarcastically. \n \n \"Is that for you to say?\" demanded Miriam. \n \n \"I\u0027ve got to have more!\" shouted Bobo—according to previous instructions. \n \n \"A thousand was all you said you wanted.\" \n \n \"That was before I married. I need more now.\" \n \n \"Yes, and a whole lot more!\" put in Miriam. \n \n This was just what Jack wanted from her. He sought to irritate her still further by addressing himself pointedly to Bobo. \"You said it was part of my job to save you from your own extravagance.\" \n \n \"You needn\u0027t remind me of that now,\" said Bobo. \"The money\u0027s mine, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"You put the management of it in my hands.\" \n \n \"Did he engage you as his nurse?\" suggested Miriam. \n \n \"You said I was not to give you any more no matter how hard you begged for it,\" said Jack affecting a stubborn air. \n \n \"Oh, for Heaven\u0027s sake! This is ridiculous!\" cried Miriam. \"Are you compelled to go down on your knees to beg your own money?\" \n \n \"No, I\u0027m not!\" cried Bobo, banging the table. \"I want money, and I want it quick!\" \n \n Jack looked more stubborn than ever. \"I\u0027ll talk to you afterwards,\" he said. \"We can\u0027t discuss business at meals.\" \n \n \"Look here, you\u0027d better understand you\u0027ll talk business whenever we want!\" said Miriam. \n \n Jack frowned. Still addressing Bobo he said: \"We got along all right till she began to butt in.\" \n \n Miriam turned pale with anger. This, as Jack intended it to be, was an outrageous affront to the dignity she now affected. \n \n \"Are you—going to—sit there—and let him insult me!\" she stammered to Bobo. \n \n Bobo banged the table again. That table was of inestimable support to him. \"No, I\u0027m not! You apologize to her!\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t!\" muttered Jack, feigning the sulks. \n \n \"Apologize to her!\" shouted Bobo. \n \n \"Oh, I apologize,\" said Jack gracelessly. \n \n \"That\u0027s no apology!\" said Miriam. \n \n Jack sprang up and made a sweeping bow, one hand on his breast. \"I humbly beg your ladyship\u0027s pardon,\" he said ironically. \n \n Miriam was almost ready to cry now. \"Don\u0027t you see he\u0027s insulting me more than ever!\" \n \n Bobo banged the table again. \"You treat her with proper respect or I\u0027ll fire you!\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t dare fire me,\" said Jack threateningly. \n \n Miriam caught him up as quick as lightning. \"Don\u0027t dare fire you! Why not, I\u0027d like to know!\" Turning to Bobo: \"Has he got something on you? Is that why we\u0027ve had to put up with his cheek all this while! Oh, I see it all now!\" \n \n Jack, while preserving his defiant front, was quivering with laughter inside. The thing was working better than he had dared hope. \n \n \"What do you care what he\u0027s got on you!\" continued Miriam. \"Aren\u0027t you worth a hundred millions? A millionaire can do anything he wants and get away with it!\" \n \n \"You\u0027re right!\" cried Bobo banging the table. \"I\u0027m tired of having it thrown up to me. I\u0027m tired of being under the thumb of my own secretary. I can do what I want! I can spend my money the way I want! You\u0027re fired, do you hear!\" \n \n Miriam smiled an unpleasant smile. Her dearest wish was coming true. \n \n Jack made out to be much taken aback. \"You don\u0027t dare,\" he muttered. \n \n \"We\u0027ll see whether I dare! You pack up your things and get out before night, see? I\u0027ll pay you a month\u0027s salary to be rid of you!\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t go,\" said Jack. \n \n \"Then you\u0027ll be thrown out!\" said Miriam. \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell what I know!\" \n \n \"Go ahead and tell it,\" said Bobo. \"I\u0027m sick of hearing about it!\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell her!\" \n \n \"Tell me,\" said Miriam. \"I guess I can stand it.\" \n \n \"When we worked in the sash and blind factory together,\" said Jack with the air of one delivering damning evidence, \"he used to swipe his lunch money out of the petty cash, and make phony entries in the cash book to hide it. I caught him at it!\" \n \n Bobo hung his head in simulated shame. It was good comedy. \n \n Miriam shouted with laughter. \"Is that all!\" To Bobo: \"You poor idiot! Do you mean to say that was all he had over you to set him up so!\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ve fired him, haven\u0027t I?\" said Bobo with an aggrieved air. To Jack he added: \"Now you\u0027ve done your worst, get!\" \n \n Jack put on an air of swaggering bravado. \"Oh, all right! I\u0027m sick of the job anyhow! I wouldn\u0027t work for you now for ten times the salary!\" \n \n Miriam laughed insultingly. \n \n Jack arose. He still had to make a good exit. \"It\u0027s hard enough to take all the work and the responsibility,\" he said with assumed bitterness, \"but when your boss marries a——\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll leave her out of it, or I\u0027ll smash you!\" cried Bobo. \n \n \"Come on! Let\u0027s settle it man to man,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027m ready any time!\" \n \n \"You get out of here!\" shouted Bobo. \"Or I\u0027ll call the house detective!\" \n \n Jack went, slamming the door. He proceeded to his own room, chuckling. \n \n Later, while he was packing, he heard a timid knock. Bobo was standing outside with a deprecating air. \n \n \"Can I come in?\" \n \n \"Sure! Where\u0027s Miriam?\" \n \n \"We\u0027re safe. She\u0027s gone out to see about getting me another secretary.\" \n \n Jack laughed. \"Poor Bobo!\" \n \n \"It went off all right,\" said Bobo. \"She doesn\u0027t suspect a thing!\" \n \n \"Fine!\" said Jack. \n \n \"What are you going to do?\" \n \n \"Take a little trip. British Guiana. Boat leaves Saturday.\" \n \n \"Lucky Dog!\" \n \n \"What, already!\" \n \n \"Oh, it was my fate, I suppose.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61371.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
