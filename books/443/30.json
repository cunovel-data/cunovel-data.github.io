{"id":12425,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"A few hours later the bridal couple turned up at the Madagascar. Miriam was beautiful and beautifully dressed, but feeling sure of her position now, she made no attempt to curb her arrogance. She believed that she owned the Madagascar and acted accordingly. The hotel servants cringed—and detested her. Bobo was correspondingly depressed and anxious-looking. Their unannounced arrival hardly surprised Jack. He was in expectation of a call for funds. Miriam immediately demanded to be shown through the suite. \"So that I can choose which rooms I will take.\" Jack, amused by the comedy, accompanied her and Bobo on the tour of inspection. Jack\u0027s room, the next room but one to the Dutch room, seemed to please her most. Perhaps it was because she knew it was Jack\u0027s room. \"I\u0027ll take this for my bedroom,\" she said, \"but the furniture is ghastly. It will have to be completely done over. Bobo\u0027s room shall be my boudoir.\" Bobo glanced anxiously at Jack. \"You can have my room of course,\" he said quickly. \"But this is Jack\u0027s room.\" It seemed as if she had just been lying in wait for him to say something like this. She whirled on him. \"Well, and am I supposed to give way to your secretary? If you\u0027re willing to give up the best rooms to the servants I\u0027m not!\" \"Miriam is right,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027ll move into the two little rooms at the back; Silas Gyde\u0027s old suite.\" \"Hereafter please address me as Mrs. Norman,\" said Miriam haughtily. \"Certainly, Mrs. Norman,\" said Jack demurely. To himself he added: \"Oh, lady, lady, it\u0027s a shame to let you in so bad! When the truth come out the shock will surely kill you!\" \"And while we are away,\" added Miriam, \"go to a first class decorator, and arrange to have my two rooms done. I will have the boudoir hung in pale yellow silk brocade, and the bedroom in a softer material, pink. Samples can be sent me.\" Jack bowed. \"You\u0027re going away again?\" he asked politely. \"Oh, yes, Bobo just came in to get some money.\" Bobo bent an imploring glance on him. Jack had his things carried into the back rooms, and put all in order there. \"Thank God! I can escape the sound of her voice!\" he said to himself. \"Where, oh where is that sweet murmur with which she used to woo us! Bobo\u0027s awakening has come even sooner than I expected. She might have given him a few days\u0027 run for his money. What a story this will make to tell Kate later. But the poor fat kid is in such a deuce of a hole it really spoils the comedy!\" Presently Bobo applied at the door of Jack\u0027s sitting-room with a pitiful hang-dog air. \"Come in!\" said Jack cheerfully. Bobo shambled in, and flung himself in a chair. \"Don\u0027t bawl me out!\" he said beseechingly. \"I\u0027m just about all in!\" \"I\u0027m not going to say much,\" returned Jack. \"But I\u0027m only human. You can\u0027t expect me to keep my mouth shut altogether.\" \"I wish I were dead!\" said Bobo. \"Cheer up, the worst is yet to come! There\u0027s good comedy in it, I assure you. I\u0027ll give you a piece of good advice if you like.\" \"What is it?\" \"Well, when a wife takes that highty-tighty tone towards her husband they say there\u0027s only one remedy.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Corporal punishment,\" said Jack, grinning. \"Eh?\" said Bobo, staring. \"I believe the English law allows a man a rod no thicker than his thumb for the purpose of maintaining domestic discipline.\" Bobo refused to see the joke. He sat in silence with his chin on his breast. \"I suppose you\u0027re waiting for money,\" said Jack. Bobo nodded. \"I don\u0027t want to rub it in, but I\u0027m curious to know if you appreciate the colossal cheek of your coming to me for money after what has happened?\" Bobo nodded again. \"What else could I do?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if part of it was actually for the purpose of settling with the man who helped you to disobey my orders.\" \"Miriam fixed that up by wireless.\" \"Then I might suggest that it\u0027s up to her to settle with the man. You told me Miriam was well-fixed, you know.\" \"Something has happened,\" said Bobo. \"We went to the Bienvenu before coming here. Some one called her up there. She wouldn\u0027t let me hear what she said. She was sore afterwards. Seems her income is cut off or something.\" \"That\u0027s not hard to guess,\" said Jack. \"The old man told her that now she\u0027s got you, she can afford to dispense with his weekly contribution.\" \"Do you really think she\u0027s in his pay?\" \"Oh, let\u0027s don\u0027t go into that again.\" \"Good Lord! What will become of me!\" groaned Bobo. \"I\u0027ve got to show her the color of my money, or she\u0027ll worm the truth out of me!\" \"You\u0027ll never tell her the truth. She\u0027d kill you.\" \"She\u0027ll guess the truth, if I don\u0027t keep her supplied!\" \"You should have thought of that yesterday.\" \"Don\u0027t be so hard on me!\" whined Bobo. \"What\u0027s the money to you!\" Jack felt slightly disgusted. \"I\u0027m going to keep you supplied,\" he said, \"within reason. But you\u0027ll have to keep that young lady inside the limits that I set. I\u0027ve no intention of maintaining her like the Queen of Sheba. Tell her your money\u0027s in the hands of trustees. Tell her anything you like.\" \"How much?\" said Bobo anxiously. \"Five thousand for the honeymoon. After that a thousand weekly. Not another cent.\" \"I\u0027ve got to have the limousine,\" whined Bobo. Jack\u0027s lip curled. \"You\u0027re not exactly in a position to make demands. However, you can have the car. It\u0027s no good to me.\" Bobo commenced to stammer his thanks. \"Cut it out!\" said Jack. \"I\u0027m only doing it, because it happens to suit my plans. You have disobeyed my orders, and forfeited all claims on me. I reserve the right of course, to show you up whenever it suits me.\" Bobo lived in the present. Seeing his immediate needs relieved, he refused to consider the unpleasant future. His eye brightened as Jack went to write him a check.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61365.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
