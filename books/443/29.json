{"id":12424,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"Jack returned to New York on the night train. At the hotel he found a message from Starr of the Bienvenu Hotel reading: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A.D.T. boy 791 came with a package for Miss Culbreth to-day. When he was told she was out of town he took it back with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack\u0027s police credentials smoothed the way for him with the A.D.T. officials, and within two hours of the time he received the message, No. 791, otherwise Tommy Mullulus, was on his way to the Madagascar to be questioned. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was a small, thin boy with a wary eye that testified to a wide experience of the world, and an insinuating grin that was still childlike. His meager limbs were lost in his faded, flapping trousers, but he had a doughty air far beyond his years. His official age was fifteen; had he not to swear to that to get his \"working papers\"? But actually he was about two years short of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was disposed to be evasive in answering Jack\u0027s questions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You brought a package to the Hotel Bienvenu yesterday?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where did you get it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At the office. Fella at the desk handed it to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That means it was brought into the office by the person who wanted it delivered?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is your office?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"1118 Broadway.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you see the person that brought the package in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t take no particular notice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, was it a man or a woman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t rightly look.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it a fact when you boys are waiting for a call, that you size up everybody that comes in to see what kind of a job you\u0027re going to get, and what\u0027s likely to be in it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We gen\u0027ally does,\" said Tommy with an innocent air, \"but Fat Harris was pushin\u0027 me on the bench, and I was pushin\u0027 him back, so I didn\u0027t take no notice of who come in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It suggested itself to Jack that the boy was under the spell of a generous tip. To offer him a larger tip was the most obvious course, but Jack, knowing something about boys, hesitated. Tommy would take the money, of course, but it would probably make him suspicious, and therefore more secretive than before. A better way was to win his confidence if it could be done. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tommy,\" said Jack, \"the guy that gave you that package is a crook, and I\u0027m trying to land him, see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tommy looked interested but wary. He required to be shown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did they tell you at the office who I was?\" asked Jack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No more than your name was Robinson.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you ever hear of John Farrow Norman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The poor boy that came in for a hundred million! You bet!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I work for him. I\u0027m his secretary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A noiseless whistle escaped through Tommy\u0027s lips. But he still looked a little incredulous. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can find that out at the office on your way out,\" suggested Jack. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tommy looked impressed by this evidence of good faith. \"Say, boss, can I see him himself—Norman I mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s out of town to-day. But you\u0027ll see him all the time if you work for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tommy was melting fast. \"On the level, do you want me to work for you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surest thing you know!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What doing?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, just a little detective work,\" said Jack carelessly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tommy was won. \"Oh-h! Detective work! That\u0027s my specialty!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The man who sent that package to the Bienvenu Hotel is trying to blackmail Mr. Norman,\" said Jack. \"We\u0027ve got to catch him with the goods.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tommy nodded sagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See if you can\u0027t remember what he looked like. Was he a middle-aged man short and thickset, well-dressed, but not sporty, heavy white moustache, and little chin whisker?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure!\" cried Tommy. \"That\u0027s the very guy! I remember now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, give me some further particulars then,\" said Jack to test him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tommy considered. \"His hair was brushed in a funny way, sticking out like, in front of his ears.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s our man!\" said Jack. \"Has he ever been in your office before?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, once in a while. He\u0027s a guy you\u0027d remember. Gives big tips.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you couldn\u0027t deliver that package at the Bienvenu what did you do with it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Handed it in at the office again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then what happened to it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s there yet. They couldn\u0027t return it to sender because he didn\u0027t leave no address.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure he hasn\u0027t been after it himself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not up to the time I left. Us boys watches for that guy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thought you said you couldn\u0027t remember him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t know which side was on the square then,\" said Tommy unabashed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good! I\u0027m sure he will come after it, and I want you to go back to the office and watch for him. When he does come in, see if you\u0027re clever enough to trail him back to his home or his office, or wherever it is he goes, see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I sneak out without orders from the desk?\" objected Tommy. \"And supposin\u0027 I\u0027m out on another call when he comes in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can leave that to me,\" said Jack. \"From now on you\u0027re working for me, and you won\u0027t take any other calls, see? I\u0027ll have an order sent through from the head office to your branch. But mind you, not a word to any of the other kids!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right, boss,\" said the diminutive sleuth with dignity. \"I know a thing or two about this biz. I can easy stall off those pore fish down there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s something on account,\" said Jack offering him a dollar bill. \"As to your final payment I\u0027ll just say this: if you and I pull this off together, I\u0027ll offer you a permanent job with Mr. Norman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me workin\u0027 for Norman himself! Gee!\" said Tommy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61364.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
