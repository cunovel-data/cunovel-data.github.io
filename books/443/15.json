{"id":12410,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"In the end Jack had to give up the idea of separating Bobo from the lovely Miriam. For one thing Jack needed Miriam and Mrs. Cleaver in his present business, and Bobo supplied his only excuse for going there. The ladies were not interested in the humble secretary for himself. \n \n So he warned Bobo afresh, and prayed that the infatuated youth might not be led into any irrevocable step before he was able to tell him the whole truth about his inamorata. \n \n Meanwhile one of those tremendous intimacies characteristic of the fluff of society sprang up between the four. Within a few days Bobo and Jack were all but living at Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s house. A hundredfold millionaire gets on fast socially. Jack was always included in Bobo\u0027s invitations as an understood thing. One witty lady was heard to call him the sugar that coated the pill. \n \n Jack speculated endlessly on the real nature of the relations between Clara Cleaver and Miriam. It was given out that they were cousins, and on the surface they exhibited a formal affection towards each other. But that they did not love each other was very clear. Dislike the same as murder will out. Off her guard Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s manner towards Miriam was as to something she was obliged to put up with, and the younger woman in her more natural moments displayed more than a touch of arrogance towards her supposed hostess. Moreover, Mrs. Cleaver was clearly well-born and Miriam just as clearly was not. Not for a moment did Jack believe in the supposed blood relationship. \n \n Jack liked Mrs. Cleaver a lot better than Miriam. The former might be light-headed, vain, luxury-loving, rather silly, but she had a kind heart. Jack could not conceive of her as being engaged in calculated villainy. Yet she must be in the game, too. She and Miriam worked together. The farther he explored this amazing game the greater became Jack\u0027s perplexity. The different elements were so incongruous. \n \n \"But if I go deep enough I must find the link that connects them all!\" he told himself. \"The decent little gentleman with the imperial; Barbarossa, the anarchist; Dave Anderson, the detective; Clara Cleaver, the well-born lady, and Miriam Culbreth, the adventuress!\" \n \n The relation between Jack and Miriam was a complicated one. As in the beginning, she made it clear that while she intended to marry the millionaire she was not averse to having the secretary make love to her. Jack\u0027s indifference piqued the spoiled beauty almost beyond bearing. She longed to bring him to her feet, and she hated him cordially, too, as he learned before he had been visiting Mrs. Cleaver\u0027s house many days. \n \n It was the tea hour. Jack had come after Bobo, but found everybody out. They had left word for him to wait, so he drifted up to the library where they usually had tea, and picking up a book he dropped into a chair to read. At his left hand hung a portière dividing the library from the central hall, which ran up through the house. \n \n After a little while Miriam and Bobo came up in the elevator. Evidently there had been a misunderstanding about Jack\u0027s arrival—possibly some other servant had admitted them, for Miriam said: \n \n \"We\u0027ll wait a while for him before we ring for tea.\" \n \n They dropped into a cozy corner in the hall, a nook favored of couples. It was immediately on the other side of the curtain at Jack\u0027s hand and he could therefore hear every word spoken above a whisper. He was debating with himself whether or not the circumstances justified him in playing the eavesdropper, when he heard Miriam say: \n \n \"You\u0027ve never told me how you and Jack met, and how you came to choose him for your secretary.\" \n \n That decided Jack. He gave no sign of his presence. \n \n Bobo replied: \"Oh, I\u0027ve known him a good while. When I worked in the sash factory down-town, he was there, too.\" \n \n \"What did you do there?\" \n \n \"Bookkeeper.\" \n \n \"What did Jack do?\" \n \n \"Oh he—he was a bookkeeper, too. There were two of us. And we were friends outside the office, too. Used to go round together nights. So when I came into my money—why it was natural for me to get Jack to help me to look after it.\" \n \n \"Not bad for Bobo,\" thought Jack. He pricked up his ears at the next words. \n \n \"I don\u0027t see how you put up with him!\" said Miriam. \n \n \"Put up with him!\" echoed Bobo. In his fancy Jack could see the blank look that overspread the honest fat face. \"Why—why, what\u0027s the matter with Jack?\" \n \n \"The way he runs you, I mean. One would think he was the millionaire, and you the hired secretary.\" \n \n Bobo made queer, scared noises in his throat. It seemed to Jack that Miriam must suspect that she had hit the nail on the head, but apparently she did not, for her next words were in the same drawling, careless tone. \n \n \"He all but tells you how to answer when people speak to you.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" said Bobo, somewhat relieved. \"But Jack\u0027s clever, and I\u0027m not.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re not as stupid as he likes to make out,\" suggested Miriam. \n \n \"Devil!\" thought Jack. \n \n \"Make out!\" said Bobo. \"Jack doesn\u0027t make out anything. He\u0027s my friend.\" \n \n \"My poor Bobo!\" she said with indulgent tenderness. \"You\u0027re criminally good-natured! Of course he knows which side his bread is buttered on. He\u0027s not going to say anything openly. But friends! Oh, how blind you are!\" \n \n \"Jack and I are friends,\" repeated Bobo. \"Jack\u0027s on the square!\" \n \n She laughed delicately. Jack guessed that she patted Bobo\u0027s hand or something like that. \"Oh, well, let\u0027s change the subject,\" she said in a tone that forced him to continue it. \n \n \"No,\" said Bobo, just as she had intended him to. \"Tell me what you mean. Does he talk about me?\" \n \n \"Oh, it isn\u0027t what he says,\" she said with seeming reluctance. \"But it makes me mad! Always poking fun at you!\" \n \n \"Liar!\" thought Jack. \n \n \"Making fun of me!\" said Bobo in hurt tones. \"Behind my back! I didn\u0027t think it of him!\" \n \n \"There, forget it,\" she said soothingly. \"It doesn\u0027t make any difference to your real friends.\" \n \n \"What did he say about me?\" \n \n \"I shan\u0027t tell you. I don\u0027t want to make trouble.\" \n \n Jack grimly smiled to himself. \n \n \"But I don\u0027t see why you put up with it,\" she presently went on. \"As it is, you daren\u0027t call your soul your own. He manages you like a child—you a grown man.\" \n \n \"What can I do?\" said poor Bobo. \n \n \"Fire him!\" \n \n \"So that\u0027s your game!\" thought Jack. \"It\u0027s foredoomed to failure, lady!\" \n \n \"Oh, I can\u0027t do that!\" said Bobo horrified. \n \n \"Why not? I guess you can manage your own affairs as well as other men, can\u0027t you? Get a lawyer to help you. Everybody would think more of you if you came right out and put Jack in his place. They talk about it, you know. It\u0027s unmanly to submit to the dictation of one who is really no more than your servant. Send him away, and see how much better you\u0027ll get along with people. He fixes it so that you always show to a disadvantage beside him. That hurts me, because I know what there is in you!\" \n \n \"Oh, you siren!\" thought Jack. In a way, he could not but admire her cleverness. \n \n She went on: \"Some day I suppose you\u0027ll want to marry.\" Jack could imagine how modestly she cast down the long lashes when she said this. \"I say this for your own good. No woman, you know, would want to put herself in the position of being under the thumb of her husband\u0027s secretary.\" \n \n All Bobo could find to say was: \"I\u0027m sorry you don\u0027t like him.\" Jack had to confess to himself that a better man than Bobo might well have been stumped by such a situation. \n \n \"Oh, it doesn\u0027t matter about me,\" she said, \"but he is openly rude to me. You don\u0027t seem to care.\" \n \n \"I do! I do!\" cried poor Bobo. \"I\u0027ll put a stop to that. I\u0027ll speak to him!\" \n \n \"Yes,\" she said with a kind of plaintive spitefulness, \"tell him I told you, and then he\u0027ll act worse to me than ever. If you cared about me at all, you wouldn\u0027t keep him for another day.\" \n \n \"You just leave it to me, I\u0027ll fix it,\" said Bobo desperately. \n \n \"That\u0027s what you say every day, but I don\u0027t see any change.\" \n \n \"So this is an everyday affair!\" thought Jack. \"Poor Bobo!\" \n \n \"It can\u0027t go on,\" she said gloomily. \"I think too much of you as a friend to stand seeing another man run you. I\u0027d rather give you up—as a friend. If I\u0027ve got to put up with Jack Robinson, I don\u0027t want to see you any more.\" \n \n The softest creature, pushed to the wall, shows fight. \"I won\u0027t fire Jack,\" said Bobo sullenly. \"You\u0027re just trying to run me the same way you say he is. If I\u0027ve got to go, I\u0027ll go!\" \n \n \"Good for Bobo!\" thought Jack. \n \n She quickly performed the undignified maneuver known as climbing down. \"No, Bobo,\" she said meltingly. \"You are right. I shouldn\u0027t have spoken that way. It is none of my business. But I can\u0027t bear to see you imposed on. It made me forget myself!\" \n \n \"I can take care of myself,\" muttered Bobo. \n \n \"Forgive me,\" she said angelically, \"and let\u0027s change the subject. Come into the library, and I\u0027ll order tea.\" \n \n It was Jack\u0027s turn to be surprised. He judged from her voice that she had already risen, so he had about two seconds to make up his mind how to act. He relaxed completely in the big chair, let his head fall back, closed his eyes and breathed deeply. \n \n She came between the curtains. He heard the swish of her silk petticoat. \n \n \"Oh!\" she said sharply. Surprise, fear, chagrin, all were blended in the sound. \n \n Bobo at her heels said blankly: \"I\u0027ll be jiggered!\" \n \n Jack opened his eyes sleepily, blinked at the sight of them, and sprang up. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter!\" he said. \"Where am I? Oh—I must have fallen asleep. Please excuse me!\" \n \n He flattered himself it was very well done. Bobo at least was completely taken in. As to the girl, he could not be sure. It was likely that being an accomplished dissimulator herself, she would on principle suspect him of dissimulation. \n \n But she gave away nothing in her face. \"You\u0027re excusable,\" she said with a light laugh. \"They told us you hadn\u0027t come. If you could have seen how funny you looked! Come on, let\u0027s have tea.\" \n \n Throughout that ceremony Jack labored with his most light-hearted air to remove any suspicions she might have that he had overheard her talk with Bobo. It was not easy to read that young lady\u0027s face, but he believed that he saw her gradually relax and be at ease again. \n \n The sequel to this scene took place later the same night. Jack, Bobo and Miriam went to the theater, and afterwards to the Alpine Heights to sup. Having arrived at the exquisite restaurant, Miriam announced that she had lost a pearl pin in the theater. Poor Bobo had to go back after it, though he had already ordered a recherché little supper. Jack offered to go, but Miriam silenced him with a peculiar look, so he sat back and let things take their course. \n \n When they were alone together, Miriam softly said, turning the hazel eyes full on him: \"Why can\u0027t we be friends, Jack?\" \n \n He could have sworn the lovely orbs were big with tears, and in spite of himself his heart leaped; she was so beautiful! \"Steady!\" he whispered to himself. \"It\u0027s probably onions or pepper!\" \n \n \"Aren\u0027t we friends?\" he said with an air of surprise. \n \n She sadly shook her head. \"You know we\u0027re not! You distrust me, dislike me; you cannot hide it!\" \n \n \"It\u0027s not so!\" said Jack. \"I\u0027ve already explained what it is that you think is dislike. You put a man on the defensive. You\u0027ve already gobbled up poor Bobo, skin and bones and hymn-book, too! I\u0027ve got to be careful!\" \n \n \"Oh, you won\u0027t be serious!\" she pouted. \"And you saw how I lied to get the chance of speaking to you alone.\" \n \n \"Then there wasn\u0027t any pearl pin?\" \n \n \"Of course not!\" \n \n \"Poor Bobo! I\u0027ll be serious. What is it?\" \n \n \"Oh, it\u0027s nothing special! I just wanted to see if I couldn\u0027t bring about a better understanding between you and me. It\u0027s awfully hard on Bobo, who is such friends with both of us—that you and I can\u0027t get on better I mean.\" \n \n \"Let\u0027s have a better understanding!\" said Jack heartily. Privately he was thinking: \"Lovely lady, what are you driving at now?\" \n \n \"Bobo is such a dear,\" she went on, \"but he\u0027s terribly dependent. He depends on you, and now he\u0027s beginning to depend on me! Well, it seems to me that we share a pretty serious responsibility, his having all that money and all. We ought to consult about what we should do, and agree on a course of action. If you and I pull against each other, Bobo will be torn in two, so to speak.\" \n \n Jack looked seriously impressed, but inwardly he was grinning wickedly. \"Ha!\" he thought, \"having failed in her effort to kick me out she is now proposing in diplomatic language that we get together and whack up.\" Aloud he said: \"I expect you\u0027re right, though I hadn\u0027t thought of it that way. I thought I would take care of Bobo\u0027s business affairs, and you would look after his personal character.\" \n \n \"But under altered circumstances it might be difficult,\" she said darkly. \n \n \"Eh?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t be dense. I suppose you know that Bobo wants to marry me.\" \n \n Jack never batted an eye. \"I can\u0027t say that I am exactly surprised. Nor that I blame him,\" he added gallantly. \n \n \"Be serious. Of course I haven\u0027t accepted him yet. I have to be sure of my own feelings.\" \n \n Jack stroked his lip to hide a grim smile. \n \n \"Have you any objection to his marrying me?\" she asked boldly. \n \n Jack lied quickly. \"None whatever.\" \n \n \"Then why did you try to poison his mind against me?\" \n \n Jack thought: \"Oh, Bobo! Bobo! I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t tell you all.\" To her he said with seeming astonishment: \"I! Poison his mind against you! What an idea!\" \n \n \"Well, try to dissuade him from—er—paying me attention.\" \n \n \"My dear Miriam, put yourself in my place for a moment. I am Bobo\u0027s friend. I do feel the responsibility of looking after him, just as you say. He meets a lovely girl of whom we know nothing, a girl lovely enough to believe the worst of—and he falls head over heels in love. Was it not my plain duty to beg him to go slow, to think what he was doing?\" \n \n \"What do you mean, believe the worst of?\" \n \n \"Just a figure of speech. You are really remarkably beautiful. It isn\u0027t reasonable to suppose that you have reached your present age without having had—well, exciting things happen to you.\" \n \n She shrugged. \"I wish I had had.\" She was unable to keep a sharp note out of her voice. \"You told him that I—wasn\u0027t all that I ought to be.\" \n \n \"I had to say something to make him pull up long enough to give me time to find out.\" \n \n \"Then you haven\u0027t got anything against me?\" \n \n Jack\u0027s eyes were as limpid as a mountain stream. If one is going to lie, one may as well do it artistically. \"Nothing in the world, Miriam!\" \n \n She leaned across the table and gave his hand a little squeeze. \"I\u0027m so glad we\u0027ve had this talk,\" she murmured. \n \n They beamed on each other in seeming friendly fashion—but there were hard points of light in each pair of eyes. \n \n \"Pleasant little comedy,\" thought Jack. \"I\u0027m willing to keep it up as long as she is.\" \n \n \"We must often consult together, and decide what is best for Bobo,\" she went on sweetly. \"And if he won\u0027t do things that you think he ought, I\u0027ll add my influence. And then I\u0027ll get you to help me with him when I need you.\" \n \n \"Fine!\" said Jack. \"Poor Bobo!\" he silently added. \n \n As was usual with this young lady, her romantic and sentimental scenes generally led up to a very practical climax. \n \n \"Has Bobo given you power of attorney?\" she asked. \n \n \"No.\" \n \n \"Why is it he won\u0027t draw even the smallest of checks unless you are there?\" \n \n \"Oh, that was one of the things we agreed on when I took the job of secretary. He wanted to be saved from throwing it about.\" \n \n \"Very wise,\" said Miriam. \"But now that he has another disinterested friend the situation is altered, isn\u0027t it? If I am with him it will be sufficient. I shall tell him that you release him from that part of your agreement.\" This was said with a charming smile, as a sort of experimental joke. \n \n Jack smiled back no less sweetly. \"But I have not released him.\" \n \n \"I thought we were going to work together,\" she pouted. \n \n Jack still affected to treat the matter as a joke. \"You surely don\u0027t expect me to yield up the only source of my power!—the hand upon the purse strings!\" \n \n She shook an arch finger at him—but there was an angry spark in the hazel eyes. \"Beware!\" she said merrily. \"The power of the faithful secretary is threatened by the adored wife. You\u0027d better accept my offer of an alliance when it is open.\" \n \n \"Oh, when Bobo takes a wife I\u0027ll resign,\" said Jack, laughing. \n \n Bobo came bustling back at this juncture. \"I\u0027ve had a deuce of a time,\" he grumbled. \"The theater was closed. I found the watchman, but he wouldn\u0027t let me in. Said he\u0027d find the pin if it was there, and turn it into the box-office. Old fool!\" \n \n \"It was cruel of me to send you all that way,\" cooed Miriam. \"Sit down and eat a good supper. I shan\u0027t be able to eat a mouthful till you say you forgive me!\" \n \n \"Forgive you!\" cried poor Bobo. \"I\u0027d go to China and back if it would please you!\" \n \n They gazed into each other\u0027s eyes, while Jack grimly sipped his wine. \"You\u0027re clever,\" he was thinking, \"but there\u0027s a serious defect in your method. How do you expect me to fall for you, when you let me see you making such a fool of Bobo!\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61350.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
