{"id":12403,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"As the two young men left the café Bobo said: \"Where are we going now?\" \n \n \"First we must find quarters,\" said Jack. \"We don\u0027t want to carry these valises around all night.\" \n \n To the chauffeur who opened the taxi door for them Jack said: \"Hotel Madagascar.\" \n \n \"My God!\" murmured the still dazed Bobo. \n \n As they entered the gorgeous lobby of the famous hotel Bobo was overcome with self-consciousness. Bobo had always thought of the Madagascar as the abiding place of remote and exalted aristocrats. He slunk at Jack\u0027s heels with the yellow stick trailing limply. \n \n \"Buck up! Buck up!\" whispered Jack. \"Remember you are the cheese, and I\u0027m only the mite that lives off it.\" \n \n \"Sure! Sure!\" murmured Bobo, moistening his lips. \n \n He made an effort, but quailed again before the sharp-eyed bell-boys. Jack reflected that since he was only supposed to be the millionaire of a day, this would appear natural enough. \n \n \"Sign the register,\" he whispered. \"Remember you are John Farrow Norman, and I am John Robinson.\" \n \n Bobo accomplished this all right. As the clerk nonchalantly spun the card around and read the name, he caught his breath slightly, and a wonderful silkiness crept into his voice. \n \n \"Very pleased to have you with us, sir. In a way I hope it\u0027s like coming home.\" \n \n The other men behind the desk, arrested by the note of exceeding deference, made excuses to sidle past and glance at the register. Instantly a kind of electric current charged the office, and was presently communicated to the bell-boys\u0027 bench, whence it spread throughout the lobby. \"It\u0027s Jack Norman,\" the busy whisper went around. \n \n \"I hope you\u0027re going to remain with us permanently, Mr. Norman,\" added the clerk. \"What accommodations will you require?\" \n \n Bobo, child of nature, rebounded like a rubber ball, feeling the immense respect conveyed by the whole surrounding atmosphere. Once more the chest went out, and the yellow stick was elevated to the ceiling. \n \n \"—Er—my secretary will arrange the details with you,\" he drawled, turning away languidly. One could see his fingers absently feeling for the monocle which ought to have been dangling against his waistcoat button. \n \n Jack stepped forward, modest and business-like. \"Mr. Norman wishes to know if the suite occupied by the late Mr. Gyde is available.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s empty, I suppose,\" was the deprecating reply, \"but that is outside my province. I assure you the rooms are very undesirable. Mr. Gyde, you know, was most eccentric.\" \n \n \"But Mr. Norman has been told there was a steel vault in connection, which he thought might be useful.\" \n \n \"Naturally. Naturally. Yes, Mr. Gyde had it installed when the hotel was built. But there are only two rooms in the suite, and it does not communicate directly with any other. Moreover the bedroom is quite dark. It wouldn\u0027t do at all.\" \n \n \"Hm!\" said Jack. \"I suppose not.\" \n \n \"But on the same floor, practically adjoining you might say, there is a magnificent corner-suite of six rooms—the finest in the house. People call it the State suite. Prince Boris occupied it on his recent visit, and the President of Managuay always reserves it.\" \n \n The apparently indifferent Bobo\u0027s ears stretched at this. \n \n \"The famous Louis Quinze salon with ceilings by Guglielmetti is included in this suite, and the Dutch dining-room decorated by Troward Handler Misty. Each of the bedrooms is done in a different period. I assure you there is nothing like it in New York. It extends all the way down the south side of the building, and it is only a matter of cutting diagonally across the corridor to reach the late Mr. Gyde\u0027s suite, which occupies the back corner of that floor. Those rooms belong to Mr. Norman anyway since they were exempted from our lease. Together with the state suite they would make—but let me have the pleasure of showing them to you.\" \n \n \"What do you think, Mr. Norman?\" asked Jack respectfully. \n \n \"Oh, take them,\" said Bobo. \"We can change later, if we\u0027re not suited.\" He gave the yellow stick a twirl. \n \n \"Certainly, sir.\" \n \n Having been shown up to their magnificent quarters, Jack firmly dismissed the train of admiring clerks, bell boys and maids who overwhelmed them with attentions. Bobo was bearing himself with admirable nonchalance, but Jack thought he saw signs of a coming crack under the strain. There was something comically disproportionate in the relation of their two little selves and their two little valises to that endless suite. \n \n \"Our baggage will come to-morrow,\" Jack casually remarked. \n \n When they were left alone in the Louis Quinze salon panelled in blue brocade, they looked around, and they looked at each other. \n \n \"Some li\u0027l sittin\u0027-room,\" said Jack. \n \n \"My God!\" cried Bobo. \"An hour ago I was sitting on a bench in Bryant Square with my stomach deflated like a punctured tube!\" \n \n \"Some rapid rise.\" \n \n Bobo gravely butted his head against the blue satin brocade. \"Sure if I was asleep, that would wake me up.\" \n \n \"Oh, cheer up! We couldn\u0027t both be having the same dream together.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s true!\" said Bobo, looking wonderfully relieved. \n \n \"Let\u0027s go into the next room,\" said Jack. \"Louis Quinze isn\u0027t homelike.\" \n \n Entering the Dutch room, he said: \"This is rather classy. We can have some nice little parties in here.\" \n \n \"I wish it was time to eat again,\" said Bobo with sudden recollection. \"What a lot of time we waste digesting!\" \n \n They were presently informed over the telephone that Mr. Pope of the Sphere and Mr. Wallis of the Constellation requested a word or two with Mr. Norman. \n \n \"The news of our arrival wasted no time in leaking out,\" remarked Jack. \n \n Looking Bobo over thoughtfully, he decided that further coaching was necessary before the pseudo-millionaire could safely be thrown to the reporters. So he sent down word that Mr. Norman was out, and to avoid possible encounters in the lobby, he and Bobo made their way out by the rear door of the state suite and thence by Silas Gyde\u0027s private stair to the entrance on the side street. \n \n At the Broadway corner they paused. The sight of the double procession of automobiles started a new train of desires. \n \n \"They ought to keep the automobile show-rooms open all night,\" said Jack. \"A fellow wants to buy a car most after dinner. I shan\u0027t really believe I am a millionaire—I mean that you are, until we have a snaky red roadster with twelve cylinders and a searchlight.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d rather have a limousine with blue upholstery and a chauffeur in blue livery to take the responsibility,\" said Bobo. \n \n \"Oh, go as far as you like! Where will we go now?\" \n \n \"How about the Alpine Heights?\" \n \n \"Lead me to it!\" \n \n This place of entertainment was on the roof of one of the theaters. A discreet privacy shrouded the street entrance. They were whirled aloft in an elevator, and a small army of silver-buttoned boys and lace-capped maids relieved them of their outer wear. The restaurant opened before them like a dream, warm with perfume and color and softened light. It was arranged like a shallow bowl. The bottom of it was a velvety dancing-floor, and all around were low terraces of tables. Overhead was a balcony, and one end of the place was closed by a great curtain. When this was lifted a sheet of glittering ice was revealed. The whole place exhaled luxury like the palace of a satrap. \n \n \"What a background for the lovely girls!\" said Jack. \"But the black coats and pants are out of place here.\" \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know!\" said Bobo, strutting a little. \n \n Jack\u0027s sharp eyes perceived that the first and lowest row of tables was by a process of judicious selection on the part of the head-waiter, filled with the elite of the \"Broadway crowd,\" the women exquisite with their bare shoulders and jewels, the men looking bored and superior as is expected of super-men. These people, as the cunning management of the restaurant well knew, formed the real attraction to the soberer folk from out of town, who sat further back drinking it all in with innocent big eyes. They thought these fine folk must be Astorbilts or Vandergelds, whereas they were more likely Follies of the Circus and Handsome Harries in funds. \n \n The headwaiter with a shrewd glance at the two young men started to lead them to an obscure corner (young men unaccompanied do not spend much) but Jack with a cough attracted his attention and with discreet motion effected a transfer to his ready hand. Whereupon after heavy study, the majordomo affected to discover a vacant table in the second row. The rail of the balcony was over their heads. \n \n Bobo seized on the bill-of-fare. \"I\u0027m hungry again!\" he cried in the tone of one making an unexpected and delightful discovery. \"Can I order anything I want?\" \n \n \"Go to it, son!\" \n \n \"How about champagne? I never tasted it,\" he added na?vely. \n \n \"What! Never tasted champagne!\" \n \n Bobo blushed painfully. \n \n \"Well, I never did either,\" said Jack, grinning. \"One bottle because this is a party. But mind you, the limit is always one bottle. We\u0027ve got head work to do.\" \n \n \"Sure, that\u0027s right,\" said Bobo, but without any great conviction, and Jack reflected that along with his other pre-occupations he would have to keep an eye on his partner\u0027s potations. \n \n Bobo went into conference with the waiter, and in due course a little Lucullan feast was spread before them. It may be remarked in passing, that where his stomach was concerned Bobo proved to be an astonishingly apt scholar. Within a week he was a menu-card-sharp, and within a month the intimate friend of every head-waiter on Broadway. \n \n Meanwhile the great curtain was lifted, and enchanting slender-legged damsels, in chiffons and furs, performed amazing and graceful evolutions on the ice. Between times, the diners danced on the waxed floor. The teasing music made Jack think of Kate. He looked across the table with distaste. \n \n \"What wouldn\u0027t I give to have her there instead of that greedy Bobo,\" he thought. \"Lord! I suppose I\u0027m saddled with him now, by day and by night!\" \n \n During a pause in the music a small object dropped on their table, bounced and lay still. It was a piece of paper folded into a pellet. \n \n \"A note!\" said Bobo excitedly. \"We\u0027ve made a hit with somebody. Is it for you or me do you think?\" \n \n \"You can have my share,\" said Jack indifferently. \n \n Bobo eagerly opened the paper, while Jack\u0027s attention strayed over the crowd. He wasn\u0027t going to allow the writer of the note to see that the receipt of it excited him at all, like the foolish Bobo, whose hands actually were trembling. \n \n Jack\u0027s glance was sharply recalled by an odd little sound from his partner. Bobo\u0027s ruddy cheeks had paled, and his mouth was hanging open stupidly. \n \n \"Read it,\" he gasped, handing the note over. \n \n It was not what Jack expected. There was no salutation. \n \n \n \"We have picked up your trail now, and don\u0027t you think we\u0027ll ever let it go. When one of us drops it, there will be another handy to pick it up. When the time comes we\u0027ll strike, and there will be another rotten millionaire the less to sweat the poor. You will offer a good-size mark. You needn\u0027t think your skinny secretary will be any protection. A hundred like him wouldn\u0027t save you. \n \n \"The Red Gang.\" \n \n \n While the tone of the note was the same as the other, this had been written by an educated hand. Jack looked sharply around the nearby tables. No face betrayed any self-consciousness. Behind them sat an honest couple from the suburbs; in front was a party of eight in evening dress, the men silly from too much champagne, the women bored and listless; at their right was a young couple, wholly and completely absorbed in each other; at their left, across an aisle, a gay old gentleman and a languid lady of the chorus—it seemed hard to credit that the note could have come from any of these. \n \n \"What shall we do?\" murmured Bobo tremulously. \n \n \"Laugh at it, and let the sender see us laughing,\" said Jack, suiting the action to the word. \n \n \"It seemed to drop straight down,\" thought Bobo. \n \n \"The balcony!\" thought Jack. He rose without any appearance of haste and made his way up-stairs. He had no difficulty in picking out the table that was just over their heads. It was now empty. The napkins lay where they had been dropped. He summoned the waiter. \n \n \"Who sat at that table?\" \n \n The man cringed to the authoritative air. \"An elderly couple, sir. Never saw them before.\" \n \n \"Describe them.\" \n \n \"Plain people, sir. Quietly dressed. But very genteel and liberal.\" \n \n This seemed to be about the best the waiter could do, even with the stimulus of a generous tip. He did add that the old gentleman wore a heavy gray mustache and small imperial. \n \n \"They have just gone?\" said Jack. \n \n \"Just took the elevator, sir.\" \n \n Jack returned to Bobo. \n \n \"What shall we do?\" said the fat youth again. \n \n \"Oh, cheer up! Everything\u0027s going fine! Don\u0027t you see they\u0027ve swallowed my bait whole. They think you\u0027re the millionaire!\" \n \n \"That\u0027s fine for you,\" said Bobo, looking around nervously, \"but where do I get off at?\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61343.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
