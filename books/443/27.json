{"id":12422,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"Nowadays it is difficult for the great to conceal their movements. In spite of the precautions he had taken, the story of the chartering of the Columbian, and the young millionaire\u0027s sudden departure on a Southern cruise was in the next morning\u0027s papers. Jack silently cursed the yacht-broker. \n \n He had no more than read the story, he was still lingering over his breakfast, when the telephone in the Dutch room rang, and the voice on the wire said: \n \n \"Miss Culbreth is asking for you.\" \n \n \"What!\" cried Jack. \"You mean she\u0027s downstairs!\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re sure it\u0027s me she wants?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir, Mr. Robinson,\" she said. \n \n Jack hesitated before answering. To tell the truth his courage sunk slowly into his boots. He would sooner have faced five strong men than the infuriated Miriam. But as soon as he realized he was afraid his obstinacy came into play. He said to himself: \"I\u0027m not going to let her bluff me.\" Aloud he said curtly: \"Show her up.\" \n \n Although she must have set out from home in a rage, Miriam had not on that account neglected her appearance. She wore a little red hat with a cunning flare to the brim, and was otherwise all in black. Her fine eyes were dark with anger. \n \n \"By the Lord she\u0027s beautiful!\" thought Jack. \"It\u0027s all very well for Kate to talk, but there\u0027s a dangerous delight in fighting a woman like this!\" \n \n She lost no time coming to the point. \"Is this story in the papers about Bobo true?\" she demanded, declining to sit. \n \n \"More or less,\" said Jack. \n \n \"What do you mean by that? Has he gone away?\" \n \n \"Just a little trip for his health.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe you!\" \n \n \"Then why ask?\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve had him kidnapped!\" \n \n \"Ahead of you, eh?\" \n \n \"Spare me your impudence, please!\" \n \n Jack bowed low. \n \n \"I\u0027ll expose you in the newspapers!\" she threatened \n \n \"Go ahead! You may be sure I know exactly what I\u0027m doing.\" \n \n His coolness made her pause. She stared at him stormily for a moment \"Maybe it\u0027s not true!\" she said. \"Maybe you gave out the story yourself to put me off.\" \n \n Jack smiled. \n \n \"I\u0027ll see!\" she cried. She darted into the adjoining room, Bobo\u0027s bedroom. \n \n Jack let her go. There was nothing in any of the rooms that it mattered if she saw. He heard her opening and slamming the doors, and sat down to his interrupted breakfast. He could see that his cool airs maddened her, and there was a kind of breathless fun in it. He was less cool than he appeared. His heart hammered on his ribs. \n \n She came running back angrier if possible than before. Jack affected to be very much absorbed in an item in the newspaper, which he relinquished with manifest reluctance to rise at her entrance. \n \n \"Well, did you find his corpse?\" \n \n Miriam\u0027s only reply was an inarticulate sound of rage. It was some moments before she could command herself sufficiently to speak. \n \n \"Just you wait! I\u0027ll get square! I\u0027ll beat you yet!\" \n \n She turned to go. \n \n Jack suddenly bethought himself that Kate had advised him to make friends with Miriam. Just how far he was moved by a disinterested desire to further his case, and how far by Miriam\u0027s angry beauty, it would be well, perhaps, not to inquire. \n \n \"Don\u0027t go,\" he said. \n \n She hesitated. \n \n \"I\u0027ll be bound you rushed away from home without any breakfast. Have some of mine.\" \n \n Apparently the wisdom of resuming diplomatic relations must have occurred to her too, for she looked over her shoulder with a slow smile. Her eyes were still dangerous. \n \n \"Come and sit down,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027ll make fresh coffee on the machine.\" \n \n She swayed towards the table with inimitable nonchalance. Sitting, she gave Jack an inscrutable glance of the strange eyes, and languidly pulled off her gloves. \n \n \"By George! You\u0027re good to look at!\" he said impulsively. It was surprised out of him. \n \n \"So are you,\" she murmured, with a languorous look through her lashes. \n \n It was exactly the wrong thing for her to say; but Miriam persistently misread Jack. So long as she defied him and abused him he was profoundly stirred; he longed to seize and tame her. But when she displayed a disposition to woo him, he suddenly chilled and drew back. He did not let her see it of course. To create a diversion he jumped up to attend to the coffee machine. \n \n \"Silly for us to quarrel,\" she said, when he returned to the table. \n \n \"Yes, isn\u0027t it?\" said Jack. \n \n \"Our real interests lie together. If we go on fighting each other, we\u0027ll spoil both our games.\" \n \n It just suited Jack to play up to this idea of their respective positions. \"You\u0027re right,\" he said. \n \n \"I offered before to join with you,\" she said. \n \n \"But you have me at a disadvantage,\" objected Jack. \"If you marry Bobo you\u0027ll have a legal hold over him. Where will I and my job be then? You as good as told me you\u0027d kick me out.\" \n \n \"That was when I was angry,\" she said blandly. \"What a woman says when she\u0027s angry doesn\u0027t count.\" \n \n \"But you might get angry again,\" suggested Jack dryly. \n \n She favored him with a slow intoxicating glance of the hazel eyes. \"You fool!\" she whispered. \n \n \"Eh?\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t you see?\" \n \n \"See what?\" \n \n \"I couldn\u0027t really refuse you anything.\" \n \n Jack was sorry now that he had asked her to stay. He saw the situation approaching from which no man can extricate himself with dignity and self-respect entire. But he was not sure that he wished to extricate himself. In his confusion he chose the worst possible course: that is, to laugh it off. \n \n \"That\u0027s good! Five minutes ago you hated me like a rattlesnake!\" \n \n \"What\u0027s the difference?\" she murmured. \"I hate you because—because you treat me so. When I—Oh, why do you make me say it!\" \n \n She was breathing quickly and her eyes were large and bright. Jack wondered how much of this feeling was real, and how much art. But no man wants to disbelieve a woman when she intimates that she loves him. \n \n She suddenly leaned across the table, and took his hand between both of hers. Her proud head was lowered in an affecting way. \"Love—! Hate—!\" she murmured brokenly. \"What\u0027s the difference? You drive me wild with your cool airs, your indifference! Sometimes I could kill you! But—but I wouldn\u0027t want you any different either. I want you to master me!\" \n \n It was a heady draught. Jack\u0027s brain reeled. \n \n She raised her head. Her eyes were embers in the wind. \"Look at me! Am I not beautiful? You said I was beautiful!\" \n \n The voice of the tempter whispered to Jack: \"Take her at her word. She deserves no consideration. Kate would have no right to blame you after what she said.\" \n \n \"Look in my eyes,\" she whispered. \"What do you see there?\" \n \n The fire of those strange eyes lighted a train of gunpowder in the man. He forgot everything. \"Oh—you beauty!\" he murmured hoarsely. \n \n They rose simultaneously and leaned towards each other over the little table. \n \n \"It\u0027s all so simple,\" she whispered. \"Let me marry Bobo. You will still be his master and mine!\" \n \n Once more she fatally overreached herself. Every instinct of decency in the man was revolted by the picture she called up. He firmly unwound the white arms that had crept around his neck. He turned away and took a cigarette. \n \n Miriam stared at him frightened and angry. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" she whispered. \n \n \"You\u0027d better go,\" he said harshly. \n \n She went to him swiftly. \"You can\u0027t deny me! You love me! I saw it in your eyes. Why do you fight against me? Look at me. I could be everything to you!\" \n \n \"Love!\" said Jack with a grim laugh. \"You\u0027re wasting your time now! You almost had me—but you let me peep too far under the lid. Never again! You\u0027re too good a hater. I want to keep a whole skin!\" \n \n She saw then that she had indeed failed. The humiliation was intolerable. She burst into angry tears. \n \n \"Oh, I hate you! I hate you!\" she cried. \"I will kill you if you don\u0027t keep out of my way!\" \n \n She ran out of the room. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61362.html","bookId":443,"book":{"id":443,"title":"The Substitute Millionaire","description":"简介： On a certain morning, just as on six mornings in the week (barring holidays) and fifty weeks in the year, Jack Norman wormed his way into a crowded subway local at Fiftieth street, and, propping himself against the end of a cross seat, opened his pap...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
