{"id":74867,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Chapter 20 Beau “Well, hell has done froze slap over. Sawyer Vincent is walking into a bar.” My mama’s voice carried loud and clear over the empty room. I sat the beer down I’d been nursing since walking in here five minutes ago. Ashton was nowhere to be found so I came here hoping she was looking for me too. “I’m not here for a social visit, Aunt Honey. I came to see my back-stabbing lying SOB of a cousin.” Mama let out a low whistle and shook her head. “I shoulda known better than to believe you knew all about Beau and Ashton galavanting around town together.” “Shut up, Mom,” I said without glancing her way. I kept my eyes on Sawyer. The hatred in his eyes wasn’t something I’d ever imagined seeing directed my way. Even though I knew I deserved it I still had a hard time swallowing it. His hair was tucked behind his ears and his teeth were so tightly clenched I could see his jaw tick. “Is she here?” Sawyer asked, scanning the empty bar. He’d thought she would come to me too. “No.” “Where is she?” “I don’t know.” Sawyer stalked toward me. God, I didn’t want to hit him. I just wanted Ash. The real Ash. The one he didn’t know. The one he’d never be able to love. “How could you do this, Beau? You’re like my brother.” The pain in his eyes felt like a knife twisting in my gut. It wasn’t enough to make me regret anything but it hurt like hell. “You don’t know her. You never did.” “I don’t know her? I DON’T KNOW HER? Who in the HELL do you think you are, Beau? She’s been mine for three years. THREE YEARS. The two of you hardly acknowledged each other for three years. Then I leave for the summer and you two make up? Become friends? What exactly happened? Because the bull crap she tried to feed me outside the church isn’t gonna fly.” Did I tell him the truth? He deserved the truth but I couldn’t tell him everything without Ash’s consent. It was her story too. “We got close. We spent time together. We remembered why we were so close when we were younger.” I stopped and stared at him. There was one truth he needed to know. One truth that was mine to tell. But admitting it would probably kill any chance of us ever getting over this. It all boiled down to who was more important. My cousin. The one guy I’d always known would stand by me no matter what, my best friend. Then there was Ash. The one person I couldn’t live without. Not anymore. “I love her.” Sawyer’s jaw dropped then clenched within a second. He was gearing up to take a swing at me. I could see it in his stance. “You. Love. Her,” he repeated in angry disbelief. “Are you aware I intend to marry her one day? What about you, Beau, huh? You planning on marrying her? Moving her into your mama’s trailer? Maybe she could get a job working here with Aunt Honey once her parents completely cut her off.” My fist slammed into his face before I knew what was happening. Sawyer staggered back, blood trickling down his nose. A loud roar erupted from his chest and he charged at me, tackling me to the ground. His fist connected with my jaw only because I knew I deserved it. But that was the last lick I’d take from him. The blood running down over his mouth now from his nose had me doing everything in my power to constrain him. I didn’t want to hit him again but I’d be damned if I’d let him hit me. “Stop it, both of you,” Mama yelled over our grunts but Sawyer didn’t stop trying to take swings at me and I didn’t stop blocking his hits. “You’re a bastard, Beau. She’s a good girl. You can’t give her what I can.” Sawyer’s words caused me to temporarily lose my cool and my fist planted on the side of his face again. Damn. He needed to shut the hell up. “Shut up, Saw,” I yelled, shoving him off me and standing up. “It’s true and you know it. She’s just too stupid to realize it.” He didn’t finish his sentence before I had him flat on his back, holding him to the ground with my hand clamped over his throat. “Don’t ever call her stupid again,” I warned. He’d crossed a line. I loved him but I loved her more. “That’s it. Get off him now, Beau. This has gone on long enough. You two are letting a girl ruin your relationship. Neither of y’all are gonna marry her. You’re kids. She’s sweet and pretty, I’ll give y’all that, but she ain’t worth throwing away your family for.” Mama stood over us, her shadow covering Sawyer’s face. I eased up on my grip around his neck in case he was turning blue and I couldn’t tell. “He isn’t my family.” Sawyer’s words stung but if he’d taken Ash from me then I’d feel the same way. I released my choke hold on him and stood up again, putting distance between us. Never taking my eyes off him. “Sorry, kiddo, but being pissed at him over that girl don’t take away the blood running through your veins. Y’all are and forever will be family.” Sawyer sneered, standing up and wiping the blood from his nose on his shirt sleeve. “He’s just my dad’s loser brother’s bastard.” I didn’t react. He wanted me to. But I didn’t. Mama clicked her tongue like she does when she knows something important no one else does. I let my eyes dart toward her for a second to see what she was up to. “Actually, Beau ain’t your daddy’s brother’s bastard. He’s your daddy’s bastard. The blood in his veins is the very same in yours, boy. Make no mistake ’bout that.” Frozen in my spot I let Mama’s words sink in. I stumbled backwards and grabbed the edge of the pool table for support as I stared at her, waiting for some sign that she was lying. “No,” was Sawyer’s only response. I couldn’t look at him. Not now. “Yes. Ask your daddy. Hell, ask your mama. That ought to be loads of fun. She hates me anyhow. Might as well make her hate me more for lettin’ the cat outta the bag.” She was telling the truth. It was in her voice. I’d heard her lies all my life. I knew how to tell the difference. “No. You’re just a stupid whore. My dad would never.” Mama cackled and walked back around the bar to grab a bar towel then slung it at Sawyer. “Wipe the blood off your face and go home. Once you realize I’m telling the truth then you and your brother can work things out. Like I said, ain’t no girl worth fighting over. You might want to ask your daddy about that too. I’m sure he has an opinion on it. Seeing as the apple don’t fall far from the tree.” What was she saying? A bitter smile touched her lips. “I don’t know what’s worse. Finding out you’re white trash after all or having your mama try and foist you off on my dad.” Sawyer spat out the words before turning and walking back out the door he’d come barreling through only fifteen minutes ago. Ashton “Well, Grana, I’m back. It’s time to face the music,” I said as I laid the single-stem pink rose on the headstone of my Grana’s grave. I’d got up at four this morning after spending the night with Leann, to make it back in time for school. I didn’t need an unexcused absence to add to my list of transgressions. My parents were probably going to ground me for life as it was. I sat down on the wooden bench my mom had taken from my Grana’s porch and brought here. “I messed up big. You weren’t here to run to so I took off to Leann’s, which probably only made things worse. I even left church right after the choir solo. I doubt Mom and Dad know why yet but I don’t think it really matters.” I took a sip of the mocha latte I’d picked up on my way into town. School didn’t start for another hour and going home right now would be bad. “It’s all because of Beau. I love him. Crazy, huh? Beau Vincent, the town bad boy and I have to love him. Me, the girlfriend of his best friend and cousin. But he lets me be me, Grana. Just like you did. He isn’t bad like everyone thinks. No one knows his heart. They can’t look past his foul mouth, beer drinking or rebellious attitude to see he’s just a boy without a dad. No one reached out and tried to teach him any better. He was left alone to grow up. It isn’t fair. Everyone judges him knowing he had no positive influence in his life. His uncle sure didn’t try to care for, discipline or take an interest in him. I think he turned out wonderful despite the bad hand he was dealt. I hate how everyone judges others around here. They call this place the Bible Belt but really, Grana, I think they all need to go read their Bibles a little more. I distinctly remember Jesus befriending sinners, not judging them. Beau just needs someone to believe in him, and I do.” I took another long gulp of my latte and leaned back on the bench. The church graveyard was quiet in the early morning hour. A school bus passing was the only sign of life. My phone dinged with a text. I glanced down at it and frowned. Sawyer: Where are you and where is Beau? I hesitated, not sure how to answer. The fact Beau was missing bothered me though. Me: I’m at my Grana’s grave. I haven’t seen Beau since he left church yesterday. I waited for a reply and none came. Grabbing my keys from the bench beside me, I stood up. “I need to go, Grana. Love you,” I said and blew a kiss toward her headstone before making my way back to the car.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vincent-boys-the-vincent-boys-1/page-21.html","bookId":1996,"book":{"id":1996,"title":"The Vincent Boys (The Vincent Boys #1)","description":"Storyline: The Vincent Boys (The Vincent Boys #1) Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent.
