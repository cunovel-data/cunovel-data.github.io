{"id":74852,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Chapter 5\n Ashton\n “Oh come on, it’ll be fun!” Leann assured me for the hundredth time.\n I scowled at her back as she got out of the car. Somehow she’d managed to drag me to the Masons’ field. When she’d asked me to hang out with her tonight I’d thought she meant a movie and maybe shopping. I hadn’t thought she meant to bring me to the field. I stopped boring holes in her back and glanced over at Beau’s parked truck. I hadn’t heard from him since I’d left him and Nicole at his trailer. At first I’d expected him to text or call but after twenty-four hours I began to realize I wouldn’t be hearing from him. Nicole hadn’t seemed very happy about my being there. I should’ve expected this reaction.\n “Come on, Ashton.” Leann opened my car door and smiled down at me. Her short, curly brown hair bounced as she waved her arm out toward the field.\n “There’s a life outside of Sawyer Vincent. I swear there is,” she teased while adjusting her black-framed glasses that had slid down her nose. Only Leann could make glasses look chic.\n “I know that.” She had no idea how much I knew that. “But coming to the field without Sawyer seems pointless. I mean, Noah will be here soon and I’ll be the third wheel.”\n “Nonsense. Noah will be both our dates.” She flashed me a grin and pulled me into the clearing.\n The bonfire and music were already pumping. The smell of burning pecan wood filled the night air. Different groups gathered around the lit-up clearing while some couples were already making their way into the privacy of the shadows inside the trees. I walked beside Leann, listening to her chatter on and on about the new truck Noah had bought. I’d been trying so hard to ignore my surroundings and everyone around me that I was caught by surprise when Leann sat down on a log and pulled me down beside her.\n “Look who I pulled out of hiding,” Leann announced to the group.\n “Ashton. She lives,” Ryan Mason called out from across the fire and attempted to strut over to us. His alcohol intake, however, made it appear more like a bad dance move.\n “Missed that pretty face around here,” Ryan said teasingly as he motioned for Leann to move over so he could take her spot beside me. “I see how it is. You only come around when Saw’s here. No love for me.” He leaned toward me and leered. I could smell the beer on his breath and I knew he’d already consumed one too many. This was a typical Ryan reaction to drinking. He flirted with everyone.\n “This is a couples’ kind of place and my other half isn’t around.” I forced the smile on my lips to stay in place. He slipped his arm around my waist and pulled me up against his side.\n “I can fix that for ya, sweetheart. I’ll ditch the bitch I’m with if you promise to follow me out into those woods.”\n I glanced over at Leann for assistance and all I got was a wild-eyed panicked expression. She began scanning the crowd. I knew she was searching for Noah to come to the rescue.\n “Um, that’s okay, Ryan,” I said and started to stand up. I wasn’t fast enough because both his hands were on my waist and pulling me onto his lap before I could get away. My heart was racing and I fought the urge to scream.\n “Let her go, Ryan. If Sawyer hears about this he’ll kill you.” Leann’s demand fell on deaf ears. Ryan chuckled and ran his hand up my leg. I slapped it away and struggled to stand up again.\n “Sawyer’s not here,” he said, holding me firmly in place.\n “Ryan, man, let her go,” Kyle Jacobson called out as he jogged over toward us. Luckily Ryan’s loud voice had caught Kyle’s attention. He reached out to take my hand and pull me up.\n Ryan laughed. “I was just having some fun. She’s the only piece of hot ass I haven’t gotten any of in this town. Sawyer keeps her all to himself.”\n Kyle squeezed my hand. “The only ass you need to be worried about is your own. Once Sawyer hears about this he’s gonna beat the shit outta ya.”\n Ryan stood up and stumbled a little bit, proving just how much he’d had to drink. “Aw, I was just having a little fun. No harm done. All that sweet untouched beauty is still in place. Go on now and run along, little preacher’s daughter,” Ryan called out as I scrambled back toward Leann’s car. I didn’t check to see if she was following me. I just knew I had to get away.\n I reached her car and jerked on the handle only to find it locked. The tears I’d been holding back trickled down my face. I took a deep breath, letting the rest of the tears free. Why Ryan’s behavior bothered me so bad I wasn’t sure. It wasn’t like he’d actually hurt me. My stomach rolled and I pressed both my hands against it, praying I didn’t get sick. Sawyer had been my shield for so long, I didn’t know how to react to situations like that one. I hated being so naive.\n The bad Ashton would’ve known what to do. I let out a sob and laid my forehead against the cool window of the car door. Two arms slipped around my waist and I started to scream when the smell of Irish Spring soap met my nose.\n “It’s me. You’re safe.” At the sound of Beau’s voice I let out a sob and spun around to throw myself into his arms. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there. I came up too late. But I swear to you Ryan Mason won’t ever come near you again.” His words caused me to cry harder and I clung to his shirt, burying my head in his chest.\n “Shhh, it’s okay, Ash. Let me get you in the truck before anyone comes searching for either of us,” he whispered in my ear. I let him lead me to his truck and put me inside.\n “I told Leann I’d take care of you,” he said as he got into the truck. I wiped my face and nodded.\n “Thank you. I told her coming here was a bad idea. This isn’t the place for single females.” I tried to make my voice sound light but I failed.\n Beau cranked the truck then leaned over and opened the glove compartment. It was then I noticed the blood covering his knuckles. Gasping, I reached for his hand.\n “OHMYGOD!”\n A low chuckle vibrated from his chest as he took the rag he’d pulled out of the glove compartment and wiped the blood off of his hand.\n “It isn’t my blood, Ash,” he reassured me. Slowly I released his wrist and let him finish cleaning off what I assumed was Ryan’s blood.\n “Like I said. Ryan won’t come near you again.”\n I nodded. Not sure what I was supposed to say. I’d never had anybody beat someone up for me before. It was a strange feeling. The warmth rushing over me as I watched Beau’s slightly scratched knuckles come clean was surprising. Apparently, I liked the idea of him smashing in Ryan’s face.\n “I’m sorry I haven’t called,” said Beau.\n I tore my eyes off Beau’s hand to gaze up into his eyes. The worried expression in them tugged at my heart.\n “You don’t have to apologize. I have no reason to expect you to call me. I just hope my being at your place didn’t cause problems for you and Nicole.” Okay, that was a lie, but he didn’t know it.\n “Doesn’t matter what she says. I make my own decisions.”\n I wanted to ask him what he meant by that comment but I didn’t say anything.\n “Do you want to go home now?” he asked.\n Not if I could stay with him, but telling the truth would only cause us more problems.\n “Um, well, I don’t have anywhere else to go.”\n Beau glanced over at me and a mischievous grin tugged at his lips. I couldn’t help but smile back at him.\n “What about a game of pool?”\n “Pool?”\n “Yes, pool. There’s a little place outside the city limits where I go to get away and shoot pool.”\n I nodded slowly before admitting, “I don’t know how to play pool.”\n He smirked. “I was hoping you’d say that.”\n Beau pulled into the small graveled parking lot of a bar. Motorcycles, beat up old trucks and a few older model sports cars filled the limited space. I glanced over at Beau. “This is a bar.”\n He chuckled and leaned over me to open the truck door.\n “Yes princess, it is. Beer and pool go together. Where’d you think we were going?”\n This sounded like a bad idea. Actually, I knew it was a bad idea. I hesitated as Beau got out of the truck. He walked around and stopped at my door, holding out his hand.\n “Come on, Ash. I promise no one in here will bite you.” I swallowed nervously and slipped my hand into his. I wanted to live a little and this was definitely living a little.\n “Let’s do this,” I said, smiling up at him. He squeezed my hand before leading me inside.\n A band was playing a really bad version of Sweet Home Alabama on a small makeshift stage as we stepped inside. Cigarette smoke, beer, and cheap perfume combined to make an unpleasant smell. I fought the urge to cover my nose. Greasy-looking men with stomachs that hung over their jeans, tattoos on their arms and trashy-looking women perched on their laps or draped against them as they danced, littered the place. Beau let go of my hand and slipped his arm around my waist.\n He bent his head down and whispered, “I need to show possessiveness in here in order to keep the others away from you.”\n I had no complaints so I nodded and pressed up against him. “Um, aren’t they going to kick us out? We’re underage.”\n Beau chuckled and led me over to an empty pool table.\n “Nope.” He glanced over at the bar and gave someone a little nod then grabbed two pool sticks and handed me one.\n “Now it’s time I taught you how to play some pool.”\n The wicked gleam in his eyes made me want to agree to anything he asked.\n “Beau, what’re ya doin’ bringing the preacher’s daughter here?” a lady with long black hair and barely any clothes on asked as she sat a beer down in front of him. She turned her gaze my way and I saw familiar hazel eyes staring at me with concern. This was Honey Vincent, Beau’s mother. I’d seen glimpses of her when she’d shown up on rare occasions to pick Beau up from Sawyer’s. But I’d never had a proper conversation with her. She was gorgeous even with all the thick make-up and cheap clothing.\n “Mama, you remember Ashton,” Beau said before taking a swig of his beer. I smiled at her even though she was studying me like I was a strange animal at the zoo.\n “Hello, Ms. Vincent. It’s nice to see you again.”\n She tilted her head and a lock of long, dark hair fell over her shoulder. “Since when did Sawyer’s sweet little girlfriend start slumming it at the bar?”\n I tensed and glanced over at Beau.\n “Mama, that’s enough. Ashton and I are friends. We have been for most of our lives. I’m keeping her company while Sawyer’s out of town.” Honey looked me up and down before turning back to Beau and shaking her head.\n “If that’s what you want to tell yourself, son, but I ain’t stupid and for her sake I hope she ain’t either.” Then she touched Beau’s cheek with her hand and turned to walk back to the bar.\n “Bring Ash a Coke,” he called out after her. She raised her hand in the air and wiggled her deep red fingernails as a way of acknowledgement.\n “Sorry about her but she isn’t a big fan of Sawyer’s parents, so anything connected to them is instantly questionable. She’ll warm up to you after she gets to know you.”\n I wasn’t sure I was brave enough to get to know Honey Vincent. She reminded me of an adult version of Nicole. Instead of sharing those thoughts, I just nodded. Beau grinned and walked over to stand behind me.\n “Now, for your first lesson in pool. We’ll do a few practice rounds before we actually play.” Beau sat his stick down and nodded at the one in my hand. “You’re going to hit the white ball into the other balls and break them,” he explained.\n I took the stick, bent over the table and tried to remember all the times I’d watched people play pool on television. Before I could think too hard, Beau’s warm body closed in behind me. His hand covered mine, making me light-headed. It took me a second to remember to breathe.\n “This is the part I’ve been looking forward to,” he murmured in my ear as he adjusted my hands on the stick. The heat from his body made me want to snuggle up against him. I tried to stay focused but I could feel his warm breath on my ear and his hip was touching my behind. His chest barely grazed my back.\n “You’re shivering, Ash,” he whispered.\n I didn’t know how to respond. I couldn’t blame it on being cold. I was inside an overly warm bar in the middle of the summer.\n “Now you’re ready to make the shot.” His voice sent chills over my body and I nodded, afraid if I gazed up at him I’d throw myself in his arms. Instead, I let him guide me into making the shot. Colorful balls rolled all over the table but I couldn’t seem to concentrate.\n “Good job. We’ve got to decide which ball we want to sink and set up your next shot.”\n I closed my eyes and took a steadying breath as he stood up and left the close proximity of my body. I straightened, praying my knees didn’t buckle beneath me.\n Beau’s gaze made my cheeks flush. A pleased grin touched his lips and I suddenly wanted to know how those lips would feel pressed against mine. I couldn’t take my eyes off them. Even when his smile vanished I continued staring at his mouth.\n “You’re gonna have to stop doing that, Ash,” Beau whispered huskily and closed the space between us. His body was suddenly pressed against mine. I managed to shake my fascination with his lips and gaze up into his eyes. He was staring down at me with a hungry gleam I wasn’t accustomed to seeing. But I liked it. I liked it a lot.\n “Ash, I’m trying real hard to be good. Good isn’t my thing but Sawyer’s important to me. Please remember I’ve got my limits and you studying my mouth like you want a taste is pushing me dangerously close to the edge of those limits.”\n Swallowing nervously I nodded. I couldn’t speak just yet because I was pretty sure I’d ask him to follow through with whatever he might be considering.\n He let out a frustrated sigh then turned me around to face the pool table.\n “Now, back to business. Looks like the solids have the best set up, so you can be solids and I’ll take stripes. Your red ball is in the best spot. It’s almost at the corner pocket over there and your white ball is very close to it. So back in position.”\n I managed to stay focused on what he was telling me until he once again moved in behind me to correct the way I was holding the stick.\n “Slow and easy, Ash.”\n I took a deep steadying breath and hit the white ball. It rolled straight for the red ball and the red ball sank into the hole.\n “I did it,” I squealed and twirled around to throw my arms around Beau’s neck. It wasn’t until his arms wrapped around me and I got a very yummy whiff of his soap smell that I realized this hadn’t been a wise move.\n “Yes, you did,” he said, chuckling, then kissed the top of my head. I forced myself to drop my hands and step back away from him.\n “Okay, now which one do I hit?” I asked, smiling up at him like my heart wasn’t racing in my chest from having him hold me.\n He studied the table and nodded. “The blue one is in a good spot.”\n Two games later I managed to get the hang of it. Watching Beau play pool proved to be extremely entertaining. I’d never realized a guy leaning over a pool table could be sexy, but after watching Beau I’d decided this was a very sexy game. Other than bending his tall, muscular body over a table and a small frown line appearing between his eyes when he was concentrating making me want to kiss it, he also made leaning a hip on the table while waiting on me to take a shot appear as if he were modeling for a magazine.\n “I can’t decide if I like the Ash who needed my assistance or the Ash who has it under control better. One way I get to touch you and get away with it. But the other way I get to watch you lean over the table and I’ve got to tell you that it’s one really hot look for you.” I kept my gaze on the table instead of meeting his eyes. Hearing him call me hot made me want to grin like an idiot. I didn’t want him to get a chance to see my reaction to his words.\n “It’s getting late. You ready to head out?” Beau asked.\n I walked over to him and handed him the pool stick. “Probably should go,” I replied.\n He nodded and took the sticks and put them away. I stared down at the only beer he’d drank for the night and I realized he was being careful for my sake.\n “I see you eyeing the beer and wanting to check it’s still half full.”\n Smiling, I shook my head. “I believe you.”\n He reached for my hand and led me toward the exit.\n “See ya, Mom,” he called as we passed his mother, who was carrying a tray full of beer-filled mugs.\n Her gaze flicked from him to me. She smirked, reminding me of Beau.\n “Alright, y’all be careful on the way home,” she replied.\n I hadn’t expected that sort of reply from Honey Vincent. She didn’t appear to be the type of mother who told you to be careful, especially since she served her son beer.\n Beau’s hand slipped around my waist and pulled me up against him again.\n “You’re getting checked out by some drunk men. I’m just keeping them away,” he said quietly as we walked outside. Telling him I didn’t mind being pressed up against his side didn’t seem like a good idea so I kept my mouth shut.\n Once we were buckled in, I studied the run-down bar where I’d just spent the last couple of hours. It wasn’t nearly as scary as I’d thought a bar would be. After we’d started playing pool, I’d forgotten all about everyone else in the place. Beau pulled his truck out onto the two lane road that led back into town. The lights from the parking lot faded in the distance as we drove further away from the bar and closer to my house. I wasn’t ready to go home yet. Tonight had been the most fun I’d ever had on a date. Even if it wasn’t a date really. I laughed when I was with Beau much more than I ever did any other time. I’d forgotten how much fun he was. Maybe that was why I always chose him to sneak off with as a kid. Sawyer was always there keeping us in line and I loved him. But Beau always led to excitement.\n “Thanks for tonight. I really had fun.”\n “I could tell. I liked watching you have fun. You’re incredible when you let that wall down around yourself.”\n “Wall?” I asked, turning to face him.\n He didn’t say anything at first. But I kept my eyes fixed on him, waiting.\n “Your perfect wall. The one you keep up for the world to see. The one you use to hide the girl I know underneath. The girl who wants to laugh and have fun. Perfect isn’t fun, Ash.”\n I let the bad girl out with Beau because I knew he wouldn’t shun her or reprimand her. He knew a part of me I didn’t show anyone else. Sure, Grana always encouraged me to make my own decisions and embrace the real me, but I still kept the truly bad side of me hidden, even from her. I wanted to argue with him and throw my wall up to block out his seeing inside but I couldn’t. I needed him to let me be me. No one other than Grana ever let me stretch and spread my wings. Beau had always been the only other person to accept me as I am.\n I nodded and fixed my eyes back to the road in front of us.\n “I can’t be that girl all the time. My parents, Sawyer, the people in this town—they all expect the good girl. I can’t let them see this side of me. But it feels so good to let her loose. If only a little while. So, thank you.”\n I didn’t glance back to see his reaction but I didn’t need to. His hand reached for mine and he held it. No words were needed, because he understood. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vincent-boys-the-vincent-boys-1/page-6.html","bookId":1996,"book":{"id":1996,"title":"The Vincent Boys (The Vincent Boys #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vincent Boys (The Vincent Boys #1) \n Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent.
