She had her legs crossed at the ankles, the tips of her loafers tapping the air with the music. \"Should I thank you, or apologize for inflicting myself on you?\"\n \"No apologies,\" I assured her.\n \"My problems almost got you killed, Tres.\"\n \"Technically speaking.\"\n \"And now I feel like I\u0027ve been adopted. You and Erainya, George and Kelly, your other friends.\"\n \"It\u0027s an odd family,\" I admitted. \"But our weirdness makes us strong. You\u0027ll fit right in.\"\n She slapped my knee. \"How can I thank you?\"\n \"Feed Robert Johnson every day?\"\n \"Guess again.\"\n I smiled. Jem and Michael trotted over to us and plopped down on the grass, still counting their winnings. Jem appropriated my peppermint lemon and told me he was going to like this school.\n The junior high band\u0027s waltz kept going. A daddy in a three-piece suit was now dancing with his little girl on his toes.\n It looked like fun. \"How about this dance?\"\n Ines smiled radiantly. \"That\u0027s what you want as a thank-you?\"\n \"It\u0027s one of the things on my wish list, yeah.\"\n Michael let out a giggle, then caught himself. His mother looked at him, amazed. His ears turned bright red. She looked back at me and her eyes grew suspicious.\n \"What\u0027s the joke?\" she demanded.\n \"You want to dance or not?\"\n \"A dance. To this music.\"\n I nodded. \"Have to start somewhere.\"\n She pointed her peppermint at me, daggerlike. \"Someday, Tres Navarre, you\u0027ll regret saying that.\"\n The hell of it was, I believed her immediately.\n But when she stood and offered me her hand, I took it anyway. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-50.html","bookId":2418,"book":{"id":2418,"title":"The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3) \n Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I. Tres Navarre for his most dangerous case yet. If you think the academic world is deadly dull, you\u0027re half right.... \n When a controversial English professor is found shot to death, Tres Navarre — P.I. and Ph.D. — is the only local academic crazy enough to accept the emergency opening at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Police assure him they already have a suspect, so while they wrap up the open-and-shut case, all Tres has to do is teach three classes, grade on a curve ... and walk in a dead man\u0027s shoes. \n It should be an easy assignment — but one thing Tres doesn\u0027t do is easy. When the evidence in the case starts looking a little too perfect, when the killing doesn\u0027t stop, Tres takes on some extracurricular research into the heart of an assassin — and lands in a high-stakes game of gangster honor on the darkest streets of San Antonio\u0027s West Side....\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:57 AM"}}
