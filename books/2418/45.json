{"id":76394,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"\"No. It\u0027s all right.\"\n Ozzie studied my eyes, seemed to be satisfied I wasn\u0027t in immediate danger. \"Couple more shots, then. Never like to leave before I\u0027m fifty-fifty on the hits.\"\n He stepped back to the table, began reloading.\n \"I guess you didn\u0027t recognize her,\" I said.\n Ozzie glanced over, frowning, then turned his attention back to the gun. \"Recognize who?\"\n \"Ines Brandon. Sandra Mara. When she was at the river with me, when they pulled out the VW.\"\n Ozzie finished loading the second chamber. \"No. No, I didn\u0027t. I saw Sandra maybe once or twice back in the old days. She looked a lot different then — longer hair. Dyed black, I think.\"\n \"Four men were all shot by one gunman — Aaron Brandon, then Hector Mara and George Berton, then Del Brandon. None of them fought back, except maybe Hector. None of them expected this guy to be their assassin.\"\n \"Argues that it could\u0027ve been a woman.\"\n \"Except I know where Ines was the night Del was killed.\"\n Ozzie prepped the gun for firing, but lowered it and sighed. \"Chich Gutierrez, then. I told you, kid. You can\u0027t figure gang-bangers like that.\"\n \"Attila the rat.\"\n His eyes glistened like ice over his smile. \"Absolutely. Let them beat it out of Chicharron, once they haul him in. Or give them Sandra Mara if you really want. One of them will have the answers.\"\n The nausea was starting to fade. I managed to get back on my feet. \"A girl at the Poco Mas told me about a guy Hector Mara was arguing with a few weeks ago — big Anglo guy, dark hair, she thought his name was something like Branson.\"\n \"Del Brandon.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I thought too. Now I\u0027m not sure.\"\n Harold Diliberto had just about reassembled the .357, but the magazine wasn\u0027t going in right. It was jamming on something. Harold was listening to us with half his attention, trying to get the gun working with the rest, and his IQ divided by two projects yielded some pretty small numbers.\n \"Chich had an insider with the police department,\" I said. \"I wondered if it was Kelsey.\"\n Ozzie turned toward the target, examined it placidly. \"Who\u0027s paying you to speculate, kid? UTSA isn\u0027t writing any more checks for this investigation.\" Ozzie was right. I could\u0027ve left it alone. Instead I kept wondering aloud, watching Harold\u0027s hands as they refitted Gerson\u0027s .357.\n \"Del Brandon wasn\u0027t smart enough to run heroin through RideWorks by himself. He didn\u0027t have the steel to set up his dad\u0027s murder, or his brother\u0027s, or anybody else\u0027s. He must\u0027ve had somebody behind him telling him what to do, a silent partner. I\u0027m thinking this silent guy went to Jeremiah Brandon first, back in \u002792. He had a great idea — use talent from the local gangs to help run drugs through the carnival circuit. Only Jeremiah wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with it. When Mr. Silent got insistent, Jeremiah flexed a little muscle and ruined this guy\u0027s day job. Mr. Silent held a grudge. He figured RideWorks would be a whole lot easier to profit from with somebody stupider at the helm. He helped set up Jeremiah\u0027s murder, told Del exactly how to do it. When the dust settled, he told Del how to pressure Hector Mara into the heroin deal. Later, when Aaron Brandon came back to town and got a little too hard to control, it was Del\u0027s partner who killed him and framed Zeta Sanchez. How does that sound so far?\" Ozzie had lowered the gun, apparently not happy with the sight. He made one more adjustment, lifted the rifle again. \"I\u0027d rest your mouth, kid. You\u0027re still weak.\"\n \"Hector Mara must\u0027ve found out the gunman\u0027s identity. Or maybe Hector had known all along and hadn\u0027t been brave enough to do anything about it. After Aaron Brandon was murdered, Hector got scared for his sister. He started talking with George Berton. Hector had two keys of Chich\u0027s heroin which he\u0027d been planning to use as a getaway fund for himself and his sister. George persuaded him to bring it over instead, use it as evidence against Del. Unfortunately, Hector\u0027s partner got wind of what was happening. He went to Berton\u0027s house to take care of things. He wanted to leave two corpses, but he screwed up. Chich\u0027s men moved in a little faster than he expected, or maybe it was a little harder to kill George than he\u0027d figured. The gunman retrieved the heroin for himself, killed Mara, but he left Berton alive, a loose end. The gunman figured Chicharron was good for the murder, but he couldn\u0027t wait around hoping that George would die before he ID\u0027ed his shooter. Besides, Del was getting nervous. As dense as he was, Del was starting to realize he\u0027d be the one on the spot if his partner cut out. So Del started talking to the police — not yet giving away his partner, but it was only a matter of time. So the gunman killed Del. Then he decided to cut his losses, take a little vacation with his winnings.\"\n Ozzie laughed. \"You definitely need to be out of the sun, kid. Let\u0027s ride back together.\"\n \"Not with you, Ozzie.\"\n He still hadn\u0027t fired. Diliberto clicked the .357 magazine into place and was frowning back and forth between us like he wasn\u0027t exactly following the conversation.\n Ozzie\u0027s pale eyes stayed on me. \"What are you saying, kid?\"\n \"I\u0027m saying I\u0027m not going anywhere with you because you might get a little trigger-happy, the way you did with George Berton. That social cannibalism you talked about, Ozzie? Attila the rat? The end product isn\u0027t Hector or Del or even Zeta. The end product is you. Point the .357 at him, Harold. Now.\"\n Harold, God bless him, did not hesitate. Like everything he\u0027d ever done for me, he did it with unquestioning loyalty and the same completely good-natured incompetence.\n Ozzie swung the Remington toward Harold\u0027s chest and Harold fired first — nothing. A click, a jammed load. The deer rifle blew a hole in Harold Diliberto\u0027s gut and flung him into the door and sawhorses.\n I charged into Ozzie; I might\u0027ve been made of paper for all the impact I made. Ozzie grunted, threw me off, and fumbled to manually load another .243 round. I ran, made it fifteen yards when I heard the bolt action lock. I fell into a sideways roll as the blast turned a chunk of limestone on the ground to dust. Another five feet of blind panic and I hit the edge of the nearest washout — half rolled, half slid into the dry creekbed below.\n Another shot cracked the air. I stumbled over river stones like marbles, scrambling to put distance between myself and Ozzie Gerson. My progress seemed insanely loud. My twisted ankle hurt like hell. I reached a turn where the washout joined the creekbed proper and stumbled on.\n At a turn in the creekbed a massive live oak levitated against the clay bank on an octopus-shaped tent of roots. I flattened myself against the far side and scoped the ridge, saw nothing. The rattle of my breath was as noisy as a jet. I wanted to curl up inside the hollow underneath the tree and black out, but I knew I would merely be choosing my corner to die in.\n Least you changed out of the boxers and the Wild Turkey shirt, part of me said. Better to die in flannel.\n The rest of me told that part to shut up.\n I forced myself to keep running.\n I realized I was heading away from the farmhouse — away from the phone — then realized just as quickly that it didn\u0027t matter. Ozzie would expect me to double back to the house. He\u0027d be able to shoot me before I ever made a call, much less got aid from one. Maybe going in the opposite direction had inadvertently bought me a few minutes.\n Ozzie\u0027s rifle fired: a whiff of air puffed against my thigh. I launched forward, crashed into deadwood, got up, and kept running.\n From somewhere behind me, up on the ridge, Ozzie yelled, \"Bad way to play it, Tres. You think I wanted to shoot George? Don\u0027t do this. Don\u0027t force me like he did, kid.\"\n I could hear him reloading. I staggered forward, around another washout, then another few yards before daring to scramble up the side of the bank and look back. I clung to live-oak roots and lifted my head just over the ridge. In his red-and-white Hawaiian shirt, Ozzie Gerson was easy enough to spot. He was thirty yards away, sideways to me, feeding another round into his rifle. I wondered if the women who gave out leis at the Honolulu airport had nightmares that looked like Ozzie Gerson.\n \"All I want is what\u0027s mine, Tres. You think anybody mourned the Brandons? Or a scumbag like Mara? Your lady friend Sandra, she should be thanking me. I just made her life a whole lot simpler.\"\n Ozzie had the look of a man who was butchering a large animal — cultivating the inner deadness that was necessary to convince himself there was nothing repulsive about the hollowed-out intestinal cavity, the sinews, the exposed ribs. I couldn\u0027t double back. Not enough room between us.\n The nearest neighbor, Dr. Farn, was a half mile away over an open spread of wheat fields.\n I clambered down the ridge, continuing along the creek bank, making enough noise for Ozzie to swing toward me and fire another shot over my head. I could hear him above me now, swishing through the whitebrush. Rocks skittered down the bank. Ozzie cursed as he lost his footing. Then he was up and following again. I\u0027d gained a few feet.\n The creekbed continued its labyrinthine turns. The dips and rises and heavy underbrush made visibility low. I crashed over a mound of deadwood and stumbled within feet of a rattler sunning itself on a rock. It didn\u0027t even have time to rattle before I was gone.\n Twenty yards ahead, I saw the white shell of the old water tower. The tower was a leftover from one of my father\u0027s many failed ranch development schemes — a cone of pure lead as tall as I was, lying on its side and rusting in the sun. Just below the cone, in the creekbed, stood another stand of deadwood even larger than the rattler\u0027s. I ran to it, shed my shirt and snagged it against the top branch, then scrambled up the ledge to the water tank shell, flattening myself on the ground behind it.\n Cicadas buzzed in the heat. A gnat did a kamikaze dive into my nostril. Then I heard Ozzie\u0027s steps, very near. Grass scritched. Heavy breathing. I\u0027d hoped for some luck, but he was on my side of the ridge, not more than fifteen feet away, the water tank shell between us. There was no way he couldn\u0027t see me.\n I heard him lock the rifle bolt into place. Silence.\n I waited to be shot.\n Instead, I heard more skittering rocks, snapping twigs. Ozzie was slide-climbing down the ridge, toward the shirt on the deadwood.\n His voice was aimed away from me when he called, \"Come on, Tres. Let\u0027s talk.\"\n I scrambled to my feet and pushed. All my strength wasn\u0027t much, but the water tank cooperated. It ripped free of its muddy moorings on the edge of the cliff and barreled down the ridge, bouncing once before Ozzie turned and yelled and the cylinder crashed into him with a very satisfying bong. I wanted to believe that Ozzie had been flattened into a redneck tortilla, but his loud curses of pain told me otherwise. I started running, on high ground now.\n I could see barbed wire just ahead to the right and past that two hundred acres of Dr. Farn\u0027s land, planted with Navarre wheat. Past that, Dr. Farn\u0027s farmhouse in an island of pecan trees, and fifty yards farther, the tiny shapes of cars and trucks gliding down the highway. The wheat fields between me and the road would be a killing zone hundreds of yards long with no cover.\n As much fun as that sounded, I turned my back on the promise and veered left instead. I ripped through white-brush and cactus, heading back toward the farmhouse.\n I bolted forward, tripped over a rusted coil of barbed wire and lost precious time getting my legs untangled. If I lived, I\u0027d need a tetanus shot. When I fell out of the underbrush I found myself once again in the clearing — Harold Diliberto lying collapsed, facedown and unmoving in the weeds, the door-table tilted against one sawhorse like a lean-to. Blood soaked the grass. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-45.html","bookId":2418,"book":{"id":2418,"title":"The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3) \n Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I.
