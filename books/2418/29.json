You know where he and I were last night? You remember that man I asked you about — the one you didn\u0027t know, Hector Mara? He went over to my friend\u0027s house last night. Good friend of mine — George Berton. The two of them were talking, probably about your husband\u0027s murder, when somebody came in and shot them both.\" Ines\u0027 face had turned chalky. \"I don\u0027t...\" She took a step sideways toward a small live oak tree and steadied herself against the trunk. \"Mara\u0027s dead,\" I told her. \"My friend\u0027s not quite — yet. Jem, his mom, and I walked in right after the shootings, stayed at the scene until almost two.\" \"What do you want me to say?\" Ines asked me harshly. \"That I\u0027m sorry?\" \"Somebody with a .357 put my friend into a coma. That person is still out there.\" \"I didn\u0027t ask your friend to get involved, Mr. Navarre. Or you, for that matter.\" \"That\u0027s right. You\u0027re right. Forget the shootings are connected to your husband\u0027s murder. I don\u0027t know why I thought you\u0027d care.\" \"Don\u0027t you dare presume to know what I care about.\" \"Look, Ines—\" \"Go away, goddamn you. Leave Michael and me alone.\" I pinched the bridge of my nose, tried to remember I didn\u0027t have a reason to be arguing with this woman. \"I need some help.\" \"I don\u0027t want any part of it.\" \"My guess is that your brother-in-law Del is behind the shootings somehow. He and a heroin dealer named Chich Gutierrez. You\u0027re telling me you wouldn\u0027t like a chance to nail Del Brandon?\" \"I can\u0027t help.\" Mrs. T. rang a handbell. Kids dropped off playground equipment and started forming lines in front of the classroom doors. Jem was in the middle, walking with his fingers pinched to the shirt of the boy in front of him. The teacher glanced uneasily in our direction one more time, then followed her charges inside. \"The kids get out at one-thirty,\" I told Ines. \"What are you doing until then?\" She was silent, her lips thin and angry. \"You have other plans?\" \"The move—\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Michael\u0027s room. Come with me instead. Help me dredge my car out of the river.\" She stared at me, then laughed uneasily. \"What?\" \"You heard me. How often do you get an offer like that?\" Her mouth quivered, formed a fragile smile. \"I don\u0027t even like you.\" \"So come watch me be humiliated. It\u0027ll be a blast.\" She looked down toward the street, her mouth hardening again. \"Would we be even?\" \"What?\" \"You drove me home from Aaron\u0027s office Wednesday. If I drive you today, would we be even?\" She held out her hand. I shook it. \"Charm and diplomacy win again,\" I said. \"That,\" Ines Brandon said, \"and the fact I never want to owe you anything, Mr. Navarre. Never.\" Then she turned and started down the sidewalk toward her car, leaving me to follow or not. TWENTY-NINE \"At least your VW knew when to quit,\" Ozzie Gerson said. We were standing in the drainage channel on the banks of the river, watching the tow-truck guys connect their winch hooks to the carcass of my VW. Ines Brandon sat nearby on the hood of Ozzie\u0027s police unit. The VW lay on its back, half submerged, bashed to hell on the passenger\u0027s side and smeared with toilet paper and river garbage. During the night some adventurous kids had come by and spray-painted PUTA!! in white across the VW\u0027s exposed underbelly. Whore. The final indignity to an old, unappreciated dame. Up on the rim of the ditch I could see the flattened section of guardrail the Bug had smashed through, the path of destruction it had made rolling down the muddy slope through the bushes. The chaparral I\u0027d been thrown into was about thirty feet from the first point of impact on the slope. I was trying to figure out how I\u0027d ended up there in one piece. \"You got lucky.\" Ozzie\u0027s pale blue eyes were cold with anger and frustration. \"Luckier than Berton, anyway.\" \"You offered to help,\" I reminded Ozzie. \"I need to know where to find Chich Gutierrez.\" The mechanics attached the first hook to the VW\u0027s fender and pulled the line tight. Metal groaned. I think maybe I did, too. Gerson lifted his left arm stiffly, testing the muscles. The bandages under his uniform shirt crinkled. \"You sure that\u0027s your job — taking revenge?\" \"Anything I needed, you said.\" \"I don\u0027t want you getting killed on my watch, Tres. Your father\u0027d haunt me forever.\" The tow-truck guys started their winch motor. More groaning metal. The motor bellowed like a wounded sea lion but made no discernible progress getting the VW out of the muck. \"Tell me everything,\" Ozzie said. I told him about the SWAT raid at Hector Mara\u0027s house; the George Berton cigar wrapper in Sandra\u0027s closet; the white van I\u0027d chased down Riverside. I told him, too, about Ray Lozano\u0027s read of the crime scene at Palo Blanco. \"George found out something about the Brandon murder,\" I said. \"Something that bothered him enough to try solving it quietly, on his own. He talked to Hector Mara at the Poco Mas on Wednesday. Then he had another meeting with Mara last night. He and Hector were coming to some kind of agreement. I don\u0027t know what it was, but George intended to have the case wrapped up with Mara\u0027s help by the time Erainya and I showed. The guys in the white van didn\u0027t let it happen.\" Ozzie moved his arm again, swore softly. \"If George was trying to get Hector Mara to sell out Chich Gutierrez, you can bet Chich would get wind of it. Chich would\u0027ve had men shadowing Hector. They would\u0027ve seen him go into George\u0027s house and known it was time to hit.\" We were back where we started. \"So where do I find Chich?\" \"Leave that to SAPD. You gave them enough to work with, kid. Don\u0027t repeat George\u0027s mistakes.\" I looked over at Ines, her arms hugging her chocolate-and-beige coat. The wind coming down the drainage ditch made her red hair flicker. \"Aaron Brandon\u0027s widow?\" Ozzie asked me. \"We met by accident.\" \"The lady doesn\u0027t belong here. And you\u0027re not in any shape to be helping each other.\" \"The lady doesn\u0027t want any part of the investigation.\" Ozzie nodded, eyes still on Ines. \"She\u0027s the smart one, then. You been to see George yet?\" \"I\u0027m supposed to go this evening.\" \"I just called the hospital an hour ago,\" Ozzie said. \"His left lung was removed.\" \"He\u0027ll make it.\" \"A ventilator\u0027s breathing for his right lung. He\u0027s got a fever from the infection and the antibiotics can\u0027t kick it. He\u0027s dying, kid.\" \"He\u0027ll make it,\" I repeated. Ozzie gave me a weary look. \"There\u0027s one more thing I thought I\u0027d tell you. I\u0027m resigning from the department.\" The winch motor cut off. The VW hadn\u0027t budged. The tow-truck guys broke out a pack of cigarettes and stared resentfully at the VWs underbelly as they lit up. \"Early retirement for disability,\" Ozzie continued. \"Half pension.\" He raised the arm. \"The doctor\u0027s pressuring me about this. I\u0027m beginning to think he\u0027s got a point.\" \"That\u0027s not how you felt yesterday.\" \"Yesterday was a long time ago, in a comfortable bed. This thing with George, after me getting shot the same week... I started thinking about me and Audrey in Cancun, how we could be there sipping margaritas this time next week. We both got a little money saved up. It\u0027s starting to sound real good, kid. What\u0027d you think old Sheriff Navarre would say?\" \"You got an extra seat on the plane?\u0027\" Ozzie laughed. One of the mechanics yelled to him to come help with the cables. \"Idiots should\u0027ve brought a mobile crane,\" Ozzie grumbled. \"When I get this heap of yours out of the river, kid, I\u0027m slapping a big-ass ticket on the windshield.\" \"There is no windshield.\" Ozzie muttered some more colorful observations about life, then walked down to the tow truck. I picked my way downstream to Ines. \"Your friend doesn\u0027t like me,\" she said. \"He likes you fine. He thinks you\u0027re the smart one.\" \"Really.\" \"Sure. Compared to me.\" Ines gazed up at the flattened section of guardrail. In full daylight, the tiny scar on the bridge of her nose was whiter. I found myself wondering how she\u0027d broken it, how she\u0027d look without that slight bend. She said, \"Mr. Navarre—\" \"Tres.\" She paused, seemed to be mentally tasting my name. I guess it didn\u0027t taste that good. \"Mr. Navarre. I\u0027ve already told you. I can\u0027t help you.\" \"The dead man I told you about, Hector Mara, the fact that he might\u0027ve known your brother-in-law Del — that doesn\u0027t bother you?\" \"Hostia! Everything about my ex-brother-in-law bothers me. Talking about him doesn\u0027t help.\" She pulled herself up onto the hood of the police car, crossed her legs at the ankles. Peeking out the tips of her cord sandals were scarlet toenails, with flesh-colored smiles around the cuticles where the nails had started to grow out. I tried to imagine what color Ana DeLeon would paint her toenails. Steel-gray? Black? I mentally slapped myself. \"The first time we spoke, you recognized Hector Mara\u0027s name.\" Ines\u0027 fingertip inscribed something in slow cursive on the hood of the car. She stared down resentfully at her own invisible message. \"I suppose if I denied that—\" \"I\u0027d only wonder why you were lying.\" A sour smile. \"It would never occur to you that I\u0027m lying because I hate you, would it?\" \"Never in a million years.\" \"I remembered the name,\" Ines conceded. \"Aaron mentioned Hector Mara once, in a phone argument he was having with Del. Months ago, before we moved to San Antonio. I don\u0027t remember the context.\" \"Did you know Aaron in the spring of \u002793?\" She scowled. \"What does that... You mean when Aaron\u0027s father was killed?\" \"Yes.\" She started to ask a question, then apparently changed her mind. Her eyes refocused on the rim of the basin. \"I\u0027d come up from Del Rio in fall \u002792. To enroll at Our Lady of the Lake. It was my first semester.\" \"Aaron Brandon\u0027s first semester teaching there.\" \"I was in his undergraduate class. We... started having a relationship.\" \"And Our Lady of the Lake didn\u0027t renew his contract.\" \"Not because of me. Aaron was struggling. He didn\u0027t have any confidence. To tell the truth, he wasn\u0027t a very good teacher. Halfway through the spring semester, he knew the university wasn\u0027t going to ask him back. Aaron wanted to give up, go crawling back to his father for a job at RideWorks. I couldn\u0027t just watch Aaron give up and go back to the family business. I convinced him to stay with his teaching, to take another job for the following year even though it wasn\u0027t the best—\" \"At Permian Basin.\" She nodded. \"In April, I found out I was pregnant with Michael. That\u0027s why we got married.\" \"In Laredo?\" One sandaled foot kicked me not-so-gently on the thigh. \"What did you do, P.I. — ferret out my marriage certificate?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-29.html","bookId":2418,"book":{"id":2418,"title":"The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3)","description":"Storyline: The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3) Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I. Tres Navarre for his most dangerous case yet. If you think the academic world is deadly dull, you\u0027re half right.... When a controversial English professor is found shot to death, Tres Navarre — P.I. and Ph.D. — is the only local academic crazy enough to accept the emergency opening at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Police assure him they already have a suspect, so while they wrap up the open-and-shut case, all Tres has to do is teach three classes, grade on a curve ... and walk in a dead man\u0027s shoes. It should be an easy assignment — but one thing Tres doesn\u0027t do is easy. When the evidence in the case starts looking a little too perfect, when the killing doesn\u0027t stop, Tres takes on some extracurricular research into the heart of an assassin — and lands in a high-stakes game of gangster honor on the darkest streets of San Antonio\u0027s West Side....","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:57 AM"}}
