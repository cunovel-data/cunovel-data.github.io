{"id":76379,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"I reminded her about the wedding picture I\u0027d seen in her living room. She pursed her lips — maybe a gesture of contrition. It didn\u0027t make my thigh feel any better.\\n\\n \"Our marriage was a secret, of course,\" she told me. \"Jeremiah was still alive then — he would\u0027ve disowned Aaron for marrying a Mexican. Never mind Jeremiah\u0027s paternalism for the South Side \u0027locals.\u0027 That didn\u0027t include his son marrying one.\"\\n\\n \"But Del knew you were married.\"\\n\\n \"He gave Aaron a terrible time about me, but he kept our secret.\"\\n\\n \"Del doesn\u0027t strike me as the type to keep secrets. Especially Aaron\u0027s.\"\\n\\n She laughed dryly. \"Maybe he just didn\u0027t have time to tell. Jeremiah was killed a few weeks later.\"\\n\\n \"And how did Aaron take that?\"\\n\\n \"Aaron hardly talked about what he was feeling, Mr. Navarre. Not even to me. But the murder had one good effect — it resolved Aaron on going to UT Permian Basin, to get out of San Antonio. That\u0027s what we were doing in the spring of \u002793. We were getting ready to move. Getting ready to have our first child. I don\u0027t know about his brother, but I\u0027m sure my husband never crossed paths with people like Hector Mara or Zeta Sanchez. An acquaintance like that would\u0027ve shown on Aaron like a bruise, he was so sensitive. In a lot of ways, fragile.\"\\n\\n I thought about the papers and lecture notes I\u0027d seen in Aaron Brandon\u0027s files — all of them obsessed with the violence of medieval life. I thought of Aaron in the photos I\u0027d seen — a large man, thick-boned, dark-haired, bred from blue-collar stock, a face as dour as his brother\u0027s. I tried to think of him as fragile. I said, \"When did things become strained between you and Aaron?\"\\n\\n Ines squeezed her palm until it turned mottled. \"Christmas — when he went for his final UTSA interview. Aaron insisted on moving back to San Antonio. I hated him for being so stubborn. I hated him for dragging us back to San Antonio. He wasn\u0027t ready for the UTSA job or for facing his brother again. But I\u0027d followed him to West Texas. I\u0027d stood by him for five years. I loved him. He was the father of my child and he would\u0027ve been a good teacher one day. He was learning so much before we came back...\"\\n\\n The winch motor started up again.\\n\\n I looked at Ines and believed what she said, that this woman had what it took to sustain her husband\u0027s career on life support those five years in the Permian Basin, until Aaron had insisted on moving back into his family\u0027s orbit, insisted on committing emotional suicide. I found myself growing angry at Aaron\\n\\n Brandon for that.\\n\\n And maybe deep down, I was jealous. Maybe part of me was wondering how far I would\u0027ve gone after graduate school if I\u0027d had someone in my life like Ines Brandon.\\n\\n Ozzie shouted something. The tow-truck men gave the winch another go. They operated it in short bursts until finally, on try number four, the VW lurched forward. The wreckage of the beast emerged reluctantly out of the muck.\\n\\n \"You were back home in Del Rio the night Aaron was killed?\"\\n\\n Ines nodded. \"Michael and I were staying with friends. Paloma called us immediately, but — I still don\u0027t remember how I made it back to town safely. I don\u0027t remember the drive at all.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027d never heard of Zeta Sanchez before?\"\\n\\n \"And never want to again.\"\\n\\n \"What about justice?\"\\n\\n She slammed her hand against the hood of the police car. The metallic pop was like a hunter\u0027s rifle, half a mile distant.\\n\\n \"Justice? Justice is something you get only after your life has gone to hell, Mr. Navarre. It doesn\u0027t make anything better. You can criticize me for packing up and running, if you want, but running is the first thing I think of when I wake up in the middle of the night — my son having night terrors down the hall, hiding under a bunch of blankets, crying, calling for his daddy. I just want to run, take Michael, and get the hell away from this place. I want the past to go out with the trash. Do you blame me?\"\\n\\n I watched as the tow truck dragged my upside-down VW onto dry land, the ragtop ripped loose and trailing behind like a mud-stained cape. I found myself thinking about Ana DeLeon in her blue business suit, standing at the window of an abandoned house, looking out over the untended fields of Bexar County.\\n\\n \"Time to pick up the children,\" Ines said.\\n\\n For one brief, guilty instant, I let myself fantasize that the words the children had some relevance to my life. Then I turned and trudged back up the slope toward Ines Brandon\u0027s car.\\n\\n THIRTY\\n\\n The closer Jem and I got to the office, the less Jem spoke. His excitement about the visit to school, his stories about Michael Brandon and the other new friends he\u0027d made started to drain away, replaced by the dread of what was waiting for us back at Erainya\u0027s. I had to force myself to turn into the parking lot.\\n\\n It was Friday, but Kelly was in town anyway, sitting at my desk. She\u0027d washed all the purple dye out of her black hair. Her clothes were black, too — slacks and a tank top and Doc Martens. Her face had the freshly scoured look of recent crying. She was on the phone with some client, telling him there would be a slight delay in our next report.\\n\\n Jem ran back to his mother\u0027s desk and climbed into Erainya\u0027s lap. Erainya was also on the phone, talking to the hospital. She looked up and gave me a shake of the head. No change.\\n\\n Jem put his head on her shoulder and his body went limp.\\n\\n The toys had been carefully collected off the rug and put to the side in a huge plastic bucket, making the center of the office strangely empty. On George Berton\u0027s desk, the Styrofoam hat holder was bald. His paperwork had been removed and added to the stack on my desk.\\n\\n When Kelly finished her call, she sat staring at the empty space in the middle of the office. Then she looked away, sniffling.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re out of Kleenex,\" she told me. \"Wouldn\u0027t you know it?\"\\n\\n I reached over and pulled one of George\u0027s silk handkerchiefs out of his drawer. \"George would probably say, \u0027You can wipe your nose on my hanky anytime, chiquita.\u0027\"\\n\\n Kelly laughed brokenly, pinched her nose into the handkerchief. \"God, I hate this. I hate this.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n She took my hand, squeezed it hard, tried telling me details, lists of things she\u0027d done since she\u0027d gotten in this morning. She told me about her long phone conversations with Jenny at George\u0027s title office, about scrambling to find names of George\u0027s kin and coming up with nothing. Friends — hundreds of them. But family? The little information anybody could volunteer was slim and contradictory — an aunt in Monterey, a half-brother in El Paso, a niece in Chicago. Nobody really knew. A dead wife, everybody knew.\\n\\n I let her talk, only cueing into the words occasionally.\\n\\n Then the doorbell chimed and Ralph Arguello came in.\\n\\n In the two years I\u0027d worked at the office, Ralph had come by exactly once, on an evening when he was certain Erainya would be out. Ralph knew how Erainya felt about him and he\u0027d always chosen to respect her feelings. At least until today.\\n\\n Ralph had forgone the usual XXL Guayabera and jeans for a raw silk suit — milk white, with a black bolo and black ostrich-skin boots. Under the loose cut of his jacket he could\u0027ve concealed enough weapons to arm his own cult.\\n\\n His hair was braided into a tight cord. His thick round glasses shimmered as he examined the office — Berton\u0027s cleared desk, Erainya and Jem. He zeroed in on Kelly\u0027s hand in mine, then after a very long half second seemed to dismiss the sight.\\n\\n \"Vato.\" He acknowledged me.\\n\\n He picked off his glasses. This in itself was a rare event, and his naked eyes looked huge and dark, as if the lenses had somehow contained them. Ralph might\u0027ve been close to legal blindness, but his stare revealed a fierceness you never saw through his glasses — an honest warning of the kind of violence he was capable of.\\n\\n He held out his arms. Kelly went to him, tried for a stiff, perfunctory hug, but Ralph wouldn\u0027t let her pull away. He held her until she melted against him in earnest and started crying.\\n\\n He looked at me over her shoulder. There was one question in his face, a calm demand that I\u0027d seen before and understood perfectly. When?\\n\\n Back at her desk, Erainya said a few weary \"thank-yous\" to the ICU nurse and hung up the phone.\\n\\n She ruffled Jem\u0027s hair, then stared across the room at us. Surprisingly, she did not throw anything at Ralph to drive him from the office. She merely said, \"Mr. Arguello.\"\\n\\n Ralph nodded, acknowledging the truce. \"Ms. Manos. Quepasa?\"\\n\\n \"You have to ask?\"\\n\\n He shook his head, then disengaged from Kelly. \"And you, mi chica?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be okay,\" Kelly whispered.\\n\\n He gathered the back of Kelly\u0027s hair in his fist — a gesture that would\u0027ve seemed threatening, proprietary, from anyone else. From Ralph, the gesture was still proprietary, but the tenderness and affection for his niece was unmistakable. He let the glossy black hair fall through his fingers, then nodded at me. \"Let\u0027s talk.\"\\n\\n Erainya said, \"Wait.\"\\n\\n The silent demand in her eyes was as clear as Ralph\u0027s. We will not do anything rash. We will not make things worse.\\n\\n I nodded assent. \"It\u0027s okay, Erainya.\"\\n\\n She closed her hand around Jem\u0027s small fingers, hugging his shoulder tight with the other arm. \"Honey, nothing is okay,\" she told me.\\n\\n Outside, the afternoon was heating up, the air scented with roasting lamb and pepper from Demo\u0027s Greek restaurant next door.\\n\\n Ralph said, \"Sorry about your car.\"\\n\\n \"The car is nothing.\"\\n\\n He looked at me dubiously. Ralph knew about me and the VW. He\u0027d known me when I\u0027d first gotten it from my mother, my third year of high school. He\u0027d driven in it with me drunk, sober, in danger, on dates. He\u0027d teased me about it mercilessly while he went yearly from luxury car to luxury car and I continued clunking along in my mother\u0027s hideous orange hand-me-down. And he knew that the car had been part of who I was.\\n\\n \"Tell me the score,\" Ralph said.\\n\\n He listened while I told him of my last few days.\\n\\n When I was done he took a joint and a lighter from his shirt pocket and lit up. He took a long toke before speaking. \"I don\u0027t know much about the chiva business, vato. Some things, I got no desire to learn. But I got some ideas where we can find the guy you want.\"\\n\\n \"Chicharron?\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"And Chich will happily give us a confession?\"\\n\\n \"Shit, no, vato. That we take.\"\\n\\n The ferocity in his eyes made me shudder.\\n\\n Through the office window, Kelly and Erainya were standing by my desk now, talking. Jem was making sure all his toys were still there in the bucket.\\n\\n \"I want to keep things legal, Ralphas.\"\\n\\n Ralph stared at me.\\n\\n \"I want DeLeon in on what we\u0027re doing,\" I explained. \"I don\u0027t want to blow her case.\"\\n\\n For once, Ralph seemed at a loss for words.\\n\\n \"Ana, huh?\" He flicked some ashes toward the pavement.\\n\\n \"You know her,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Did you ask Ana about that?\"\\n\\n \"She said about as much as you are. You object to her coming with us?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"You want Ana to come along, vato — good luck. You know the rules of association. How you figure she\u0027s going to want to spend time around me?\"\\n\\n I tried to read his tone of voice, failed. \"You\u0027ve got no criminal record.\"\\n\\n \"On the books — no. You figure that matters?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell her we\u0027re going to ask around. She wants any control over the process, she\u0027d better come along.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-30.html","bookId":2418,"book":{"id":2418,"title":"The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3)","description":"Storyline: The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3) \\n Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I.
