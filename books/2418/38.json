{"id":76387,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"I flipped the document into Del\u0027s chest. \"Won\u0027t do you much good in jail, partner.\"\n He tried to grab the front of my shirt.\n I intercepted his wrist, forced it down on the Formica tabletop. \"Temper,\" I said softly.\n Ines hissed, \"Stop it! Both of you.\"\n Del yanked his hand away. \"You want to see something from my lawyers, Navarre? You\u0027ll get it.\"\n \"Del,\" Ines said. \"You have what you wanted. Now leave.\"\n Del kept glaring at me. He folded the papers, pocketed them. \"Don\u0027t fucking come near me again, Navarre. You understand?\"\n \"Good-bye, Del,\" Ines insisted.\n Brandon shoved the metal chair back, gave me one last drop-dead look, then pushed past the waitress who was just bringing the food. The waitress called after him, \"But... sir—?\"\n I tapped the table for her. \"Right here, please.\"\n Ines and Michael and Jem accepted their meals without a word. Low-cal chicken breast salad for Ines. Hot dogs and corn on the cob for Michael and Jem. Del had ordered the Sonora casserole platter with black-eyed peas and buttered squash and enough corn bread to construct a small toolshed. That was fine by me.\n At the next table, the older couple sawed into their chicken-fried steaks. The geezer with the cowboy hat looked away quickly when I caught his eye.\n Ines poked at her salad. Jem ate his hot dog. Michael sat frowning at his.\n \"Michael, eat your food,\" Ines said.\n \"Not hungry.\"\n \"Try the corn. You like corn on the cob.\"\n Michael picked at the corn skeptically.\n Jem got halfway through his dinner and announced himself full.\n \"Tell you what, guys,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got some quarters. How about you check out the sticker machines by the entrance. See if you can get me a Betty Boop, okay?\"\n Jem negotiated for a Felix the Cat, too. I told him he drove a hard bargain. Then I fished out as many quarters as I had and handed them over. I got out of the booth and let Jem and Michael scramble past.\n When I scooted back in, I tried to concentrate on Del\u0027s Sonora casserole — corn tortilla, cheese, squash, tomato, a hint of salsa and sour cream. Eating was easier than what I needed to say.\n \"I didn\u0027t expect Del,\" Ines told me. \"I wouldn\u0027t have brought the boys.\"\n \"Why did you sell out?\"\n She stabbed her fork into the salad. A strip of mirror set into the black wall tiles by Ines\u0027 shoulder gave back her reflection, hazy with grease specks.\n \"I don\u0027t want any part of RideWorks,\" she said. \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\n \"You really think signing the company over will keep Del silent about you?\"\n Her hesitation was almost imperceptible. She brought the fork to her mouth, took a bite, only then glanced up. \"What are you blathering about?\"\n \"You\u0027re Sandra Mara.\"\n She tried to maintain her look of cold annoyance, but something in her eyes spiraled downward. She lowered her fork, arranged it parallel to her plate. \"No. I\u0027m not.\"\n At the entrance of the diner, Jem and Michael scrutinized the toy vending machines, looking for just the right investment. Behind them, the second hand on the pink neon bar clock ticked its way between the only two numbers — 4 and 10.\n Ines managed a small, bitter laugh.\n \"You don\u0027t know...\" she started. \"You can\u0027t possibly know how many times I\u0027ve anticipated this conversation. I\u0027ve imagined facing a cop. Or a veterano with a gun pointed at me. Now I\u0027m sitting across from a pissant private dick who\u0027s a closet English teacher and his boss\u0027 baby-sitter, and the best I can come up with to save myself is, \u0027No, I\u0027m not.\u0027\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t call it baby-sitting.\"\n She crumpled her napkin, threw it against the A.l. steak sauce in disgust.\n \"Well\" — her voice dry as a West Texas creekbed— \"what now?\"\n \"Wish I knew.\"\n Cheers from across the room. The three Anglos by the window were applauding the waitress as she brought them fresh margaritas.\n Ines said, \"Tres, I can\u0027t lose my son.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you think I\u0027ve considered that?\"\n \"The police would find reasons to take him away. If Zeta knew, he\u0027d have me killed. You haven\u0027t—\"\n \"Not yet. I wasn\u0027t sure until tonight. Paloma has some of your old things, some mementos you meant to get rid of. One of them was a sailor\u0027s-head mug. There\u0027s three just like it in the farmhouse on Green Road. Something from your grandmother?\"\n Ines pushed her salad away. \"What do you want?\"\n \"Tell me you didn\u0027t know about your husband\u0027s murder. Tell me you\u0027re innocent.\"\n \"Why? So your report will be more complete?\"\n \"Come on, Sandra.\"\n \"Don\u0027t call me that.\"\n \"Ines, then. Let me help.\"\n \"Zeta will have me killed. Michael will have no one.\"\n \"Talk to me. We\u0027ll figure it out.\"\n \"Ha.\"\n I dropped my fork into the casserole. \"You\u0027re right. You should be having this conversation with someone else.\"\n I started to slide out of the booth.\n Ines said, \"Wait.\"\n She studied me, her hands pressed together, fingertips to her lips. She looked like she was weighing a lot of options she didn\u0027t like.\n \"You want to know about Sandra Mara?\" she asked. \"Let me tell you about Sandra Mara.\"\n She sat forward, tapped the scar on the bridge of her nose. \"Sandra Mara got this when she was eleven, trying to fend off her drunk stepfather. She didn\u0027t do a very good job. He broke her nose with a beer bottle. If he hadn\u0027t scared himself so bad with the amount of blood coming from her face, that would\u0027ve been her first experience with sex.\"\n \"Ines—\"\n \"Just listen,\" she insisted. \"You think that was unusual for a girl in the Bowie Courts? My point is, most girls would\u0027ve fought better. They would\u0027ve had their own razor blades by then and known how to use them. At least they would\u0027ve screamed, raised hell with their mother or their brothers, told somebody the truth about what had happened. Sandra did none of that. She was too afraid. She spent the next five years in the Rosedale Library, every afternoon and evening, reading books, trying to avoid going home. By the time she was thirteen, when the neighborhood locas threatened to kill her if she didn\u0027t join a gang, Sandra had read Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, fifty other books — but she had no survival skills. She would\u0027ve died if her brother Hector hadn\u0027t joined Zeta Sanchez\u0027s set, got himself shot in the leg so his little sister would have the right connections to be left alone.\"\n Jem and Michael had scored their first purchase from the sticker machine. Michael was prying open the plastic capsule while Jem watched impatiently. \"You\u0027re pretty hard on yourself,\" I said.\n Ines picked a toothpick from the dispenser, rolled it between her thumb and finger. \"Sandra Mara couldn\u0027t have been a mother, Tres. Her idea of heaven was her grandmother\u0027s farm, where she and Hector moved when she was sixteen. No homeboys running through the house. No strung-out mother or drunk stepfather to avoid. Nothing to keep Sandra from losing herself in books. She even got a college scholarship her senior year. But you don\u0027t get away from the South Side without a fight. The same afternoon Sandra found out about the scholarship—\"\n \"—was the afternoon Hector brought Zeta Sanchez out to visit,\" I said. \"I read your journal.\"\n Her mouth hardened with distaste. \"When you dig into somebody\u0027s past, you really dig, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t hard to find.\"\n Ines snapped her toothpick, flicked the pieces away. \"If you read it, you know. Sandra and Zeta hadn\u0027t seen each other in two or three years, since back at the Courts, when Sandra hadn\u0027t been much to look at. But Zeta looked at her that afternoon, and you know what? Sandra couldn\u0027t fight it. Hector couldn\u0027t help her. She let herself get claimed. Zeta and Sandra got married two months later. A few months after that, Zeta said, \u0027You stop college.\u0027 Sandra went along with that, too.\"\n \"Zeta Sanchez wouldn\u0027t be an easy person to fight.\"\n Ines stared at me as if her perspective were shifting, as if she were suddenly aware that I was much farther away than she\u0027d thought. \"Maldicion. Always an excuse, eh? Always a reason to give in. You and Sandra Mara would have gotten along fine, Tres. Sandra might\u0027ve had five or six of Zeta\u0027s babies after quitting school, waited for Zeta to get tired of her and leave, or start using her as a punching bag. Sandra saw her mom go through all that. Would\u0027ve been easy to follow tradition. But that fall while I was at Our Lady of the Lake, something happened that made me want to stop being Sandra Mara.\"\n \"You met Aaron,\" I said.\n \"I told you the truth. I was in his class that fall. I didn\u0027t know Aaron had any connection to Zeta\u0027s employer, Ride-Works. I don\u0027t think Zeta ever made the connection. He never realized Aaron had been one of my teachers. Aaron was...\" She laughed frailly. \"Aaron was a lousy lecturer. The other students used to gripe to each other before he came into class each day. Aaron\u0027s face would twitch whenever he talked about violent scenes in a book, which of course were the scenes he focused on most. So one time before class, this idiot P.E. major behind me joked that Professor Brandon must\u0027ve been abused as a child. The other students just laughed. I didn\u0027t say anything, but I was furious. I promised myself that I was going to be on Dr. Brandon\u0027s side after that. I started going to his office hours, discussing books, having coffee with him in the cafeteria. We understood each other almost immediately. Aaron and I could finish each other\u0027s sentences from the first day we talked. By the end of the semester, we\u0027d fallen in love. In the spring, after Zeta had forced me to quit school, Aaron and I still found excuses to cross paths a lot... Things just took their course.\"\n \"Aaron got you pregnant in April, and you had to make a choice. You chose to invent a new life.\"\n There were color variations in the deep brown of her eyes that I\u0027d never noticed before — jagged yellow and amber lines, as if her irises too had been fractured in the distant past.\n \"Sandra couldn\u0027t have broken away from Zeta,\" she said. \"Sandra couldn\u0027t have protected her child. Weeks before Del ever arranged an ID for me that said I was Ines Garcia from Del Rio, I\u0027d already started thinking of myself as that new person. And I promised myself Ines would do whatever she had to for her baby.\"\n I studied the woman across from me — the fierce sincerity in her face, the disheveled hair, the little crumple of packing tape on her sleeve, and the incongruous explosion of colors on the front of her Fiesta T-shirt.\n I tried to reinvoke the chill I\u0027d felt a few minutes before, when she\u0027d first referred to herself in the third person. I couldn\u0027t do it. The fact that I\u0027d been accepting her story, starting to understand the way she described herself in two distinct layers, scared me.\n \"Del knew about you and Aaron,\" I said.\n \"Of course. He warned us our lives were in danger if Zeta or Jeremiah ever found out. He was probably right. He offered to arrange a new ID for me, a few other papers, and get me safely out of town. That was easy for Del — he\u0027d done it often enough for his father\u0027s cronies. In return, Aaron was supposed to hand over his share of RideWorks when the time came to inherit. What did Aaron care about that damn company? He loved me and we wanted to be together. He agreed. He\u0027d already lined up his Permian Basin job for the following fall, so I disappeared into West Texas to wait for him and have our baby.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-38.html","bookId":2418,"book":{"id":2418,"title":"The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3) \n Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I.
