Tres Navarre for his most dangerous case yet. If you think the academic world is deadly dull, you\u0027re half right.... \\n When a controversial English professor is found shot to death, Tres Navarre — P.I. and Ph.D. — is the only local academic crazy enough to accept the emergency opening at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
