{"id":76375,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"Hey, Del.\" He was wearing jeans and a red shirt with parrots on it. His unruly mat of black hair was flat on one side. He drew his .38 from his side holster. This time I didn\u0027t stop him. He said, \"Get the hell out of my chair.\" \"Wearing your gun in the bathroom with Rita. You\u0027re inviting embarrassing accidents.\" \"Get out of my chair.\" \"There\u0027s another right there. Sit down.\" Del Brandon had apparently been hoping for terror. He shifted uneasily, squeezed the gun\u0027s grip a few times for reassurance. \"I warned you.\" \"You sure did, Del. Now sit down and put away the gun. We need to talk.\" \"What makes you think you can just—\" \"Sit down,\" I repeated. He seemed to be thinking of options. Apparently he couldn\u0027t come up with any. His gun hand sagged. He lowered himself into the chair across from me. \"Hector Mara,\" I said. \"I was about to look him up in your personnel files but maybe you could save me some time. You got him listed under M for Mara or H for heroin?\" Del\u0027s face paled. \"What?\" \"You remember. Hector Mara. The guy you were arguing with at the Poco Mas a couple of weeks ago.\" \"I wasn\u0027t—\" Del\u0027s eyes tried to latch on to something in my face, some toehold of doubt he could push up from. \"Who told you that?\" \"That would be smart,\" I said, \"telling you.\" \"It isn\u0027t true.\" \"Of course not, Del. So set me straight.\" Del glowered at the empty desk. He seemed to have forgotten he was holding the .38, which would\u0027ve been all right if it hadn\u0027t still been pointed at my gut. \"Hector Mara does some accounting work for me from time to time. But I wasn\u0027t at that bar. I don\u0027t go there and you should know why. My father died there.\" \"Accounting work,\" I repeated. \"Hector Mara. The bald veterano with the snakes tattooed on his arms. He\u0027s your accountant.\" Del licked his lips. \"Sometimes — you know. We deal mostly in cash. It\u0027s a hassle to just drop it in the bank.\" \"Mara launders money for you through his salvage yard.\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" Del had developed this cute little tic in his right cheek that was doing a 2/4 beat — DUM-duh, DUM-duh. It made me laugh. \"You know Ozzie Gerson, Del?\" The tic kept up its little rhythm. \"Deputy,\" he mumbled. \"Used to give my dad a hard time.\" \"Ozzie Gerson told me you weren\u0027t smart enough to find your way off a carousel, much less run heroin out of your company. Was he right?\" His face slackened to putty. \"Wait a goddamn minute. You got no right to talk about me that way. Ozzie Gerson...\" His voice trailed off. He sat there on the visitor\u0027s side of his desk, suddenly staring at nothing. His shirt was mis-buttoned, longer on one side than the other — probably from his armed restroom encounter with Rita. Looking at Del Brandon, I felt tired. \"Forget it,\" I told him. \"Let\u0027s talk about your brother. You and he had been arguing over the company, right? Watch your muzzle, Del.\" Del managed to focus on his .38, which had been slowly tilting its little black eye up toward my forehead. Del frowned, like he was wondering where the gun had come from. He clunked it on the desk. \"Aaron and me always argued,\" he told me. \"Doesn\u0027t mean I shot him. You can ask the police — I got an alibi.\" I whistled. \"An alibi.\" Del didn\u0027t seem to catch the sarcasm, if indeed sarcasm was something Del ever caught. With some effort, he hauled himself out of the chair. He drifted over to the file cabinet, rummaged around until he came up with a bottle of Chivas Regal, still in the little purple sack. Then he came back over and sat down. \"Stuff gives me gas like you wouldn\u0027t believe,\" he grumbled. He uncapped the bottle and took a long hit. I braced myself. Del\u0027s eyes watered immediately. He tried to rub his nose off his face, then blinked at me through the tears. \"You want to know about Aaron?\" Del sloshed his bottle around, pointing at things in the office. \"Aaron never wanted this damn company. Growing up, me and him, Aaron could always figure the numbers faster. He could\u0027ve worked the deals, no problem. If he\u0027d shown even a little interest, Dad would\u0027ve handed him the whole company, shut me out. I\u0027m sure of that. But God forbid Professor Aaron should ever get his collegiate hands dirty. Never wanted to touch the business. Me, I had a hard time learning the ropes. Dad used to beat the shit out of me when I\u0027d screw something up. \u0027Why can\u0027t you think on your feet like Aaron?\u0027 Then he\u0027d get pissed off that Aaron wasn\u0027t around, and he\u0027d beat the shit out of me some more for that. I took thirty years of that kind of crap for Aaron and me both, because I was the one who was always in the office. So you tell me — who deserved this company?\" \"You, Del,\" I sympathized. \"Obviously you.\" \"Damn right.\" Del took another swig of liquor. \"Even then Dad didn\u0027t leave me the whole business. Couldn\u0027t bring himself to cut out Golden Boy completely. RideWorks was split sixty-forty, with me named president. But there were ways to get around that.\" \"Such as?\" As if to demonstrate, Del shifted in his chair, grimaced, then glared accusingly at his Chivas bottle. Brandon: the very name connotes charm and grace. \"You were saying?\" I prompted. \"What?\" \"How you got the whole company for yourself.\" \"Oh. Yeah. According to Dad\u0027s will, I was supposed to turn over Aaron\u0027s share of the profits when the profits showed up. Only I made sure none ever did on the books. After a few years of that, I finally got Aaron\u0027s approval to sell. I sold RideWorks to a paper corporation, mine, gave my brother half the selling price — about twenty dollars. Then I bought the company back from myself and kept operating it.\" \"Cute. Who helped you think up that trick?\" Del shrugged. \"Like I told you, Aaron wasn\u0027t interested in the business. He didn\u0027t deserve it. Me, all I ever wanted was to run this company. I love the rides. A good one, well made—\" He shook his head in admiration. \"It\u0027s the most beautiful thing you\u0027ll ever see. Some of the old classic carousels I\u0027ve been restoring for this society downtown — I\u0027m telling you.\" Del picked at the knee of his pants. His face suddenly reminded me of a little boy with the same sad, vacant expression, sitting cross-legged at the entrance of a sheet cave, digging at his knee with a toy ray gun. I didn\u0027t like seeing the family resemblance. \"Aaron ever threaten to take the company back?\" I asked. \"Nothing that would\u0027ve stood up in court. You think I was worried enough to kill him over something like that, you\u0027re crazy.\" \"How about Sandra Mara? Were you worried enough to kill her?\" A little color seeped back into Del\u0027s cheeks. \"What is your thing with Sandra Mara?\" \"My thing with her is simple, Del. I\u0027ve spent a long time doing missing persons cases. I pay attention to the people who aren\u0027t around. They\u0027re usually the most interesting.\" Del scowled. \"Maybe my dad screwed her. Maybe it got him killed. She\u0027s just a girl. Who cares? She got shipped out of town, just like ten or eleven before her.\" \"Like ten or eleven before her,\" I agreed. \"Which makes it easy to believe the same happened to Sandra. I\u0027m starting to wonder.\" I opened Sandra\u0027s journal, read the last paragraph aloud, the one where Sandra got kissed. Del\u0027s face stayed blank. \"So?\" \"I think that describes Sandra\u0027s lover. And I\u0027m having trouble fitting your father into the role.\" \"Maybe she was screwing somebody else. It happens.\" \"Maybe. But I\u0027m starting to put myself in your place, Del. That\u0027s a scary thing. I\u0027m starting to wonder what it would be like if I hated my dad, and I kept playing the devoted son so I could eventually inherit the business that I loved, and then somebody like Zeta Sanchez moved in on my turf and threatened to cut into my inheritance. I\u0027m starting to wonder exactly what I\u0027d do.\" Del\u0027s eyes fixed on the wall behind me. \"Maybe I\u0027d stage something,\" I decided. \"A scenario I was sure Sanchez would believe, something that would drive a permanent wedge between Sanchez and my dad. Then I\u0027d make sure Sanchez found out about it. Hell, I\u0027d tell Sanchez myself and offer to help smuggle him out of town when the poor guy got so understandably irate he pumped six hollow-tipped bullets into my father. \u0027Too bad, Zeta. No hard feelings. Here\u0027s your ticket to Mexico. Thanks for handing me the company on a plate. \"Get out,\" Del croaked. \"Tonight I\u0027m going to compare notes with a friend of mine, Del. I\u0027m hoping that between him and me, we\u0027ll have enough to give you to the police in microwave-safe packaging. My best to Rita, okay?\" \"Get out,\" Del said again. I got up and walked around him to the door. Del made no effort to stop me. His eyes stayed fixed on the portrait of Jeremiah Brandon behind the desk, the hatred in Del\u0027s gaze as he looked at his father a clearer message than anything he\u0027d said aloud. I walked out through the reception area. Rita\u0027s cheap gardenia perfume was still lingering in the air. You go into conversations with people like Del hoping to shake them up, not quite sure what pieces will fall out of their pockets. Sometimes you pick up little shards of guilt, or surprise, or complicity that can tell you everything. Having shaken up Del, though, the main thing I came away with was the feeling that I\u0027d just bullied a kid. An ugly, obnoxious, fat kid, to be sure. One who would push you off his carousel if you tried to take his seat in the flying teacup. But a kid. In the yard, Del\u0027s workers were breaking down the Super-Whirl, forcing its huge lighted arms flat like the carcass of a particularly obstinate bug. I silently wished them luck, then walked out onto Camden Street. TWENTY-SIX At nine-thirty, I drove to Erainya\u0027s house to pick her up for our rendezvous at George\u0027s. Jem came along, too, but this time inexplicably fell asleep in the backseat as soon as we hit the highway. We drove toward the South Side on the upper deck of I-10, the VW top down, the wind skin-temperature, the lights of downtown receding behind us. Down below, dark little houses sped by, tiny fenced yards, miles and miles of laundry lines, tableaus of beer drinking on back porches, cars with headlights on and hoods up, shreds of heavy metal music. I filled Erainya in on my day. She stared straight ahead, her index finger stroking her lip. \"Kelly came down today.\" \"How\u0027re things in Austin?\" \"She says fine. She\u0027s dyed her hair kind of yellow this time. Looks good.\" \"Ah, the rites of spring.\" \"She worked the county courthouse most of the morning — got a little bored sitting around the office with both you and George gone.\" \"She find anything?\" \"Turns out Aaron Brandon filed a civil suit against Del about three years ago for control of RideWorks. Aaron claimed Del had swindled him out of his share.\" \"And?\" \"And it never went to court. Aaron dropped the suit a couple of months after he filed.\" \"Out-of-court settlement?\" Erainya shrugged. \"I guess. The question is, what kind?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-26.html","bookId":2418,"book":{"id":2418,"title":"The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3)","description":"Storyline: The Last King of Texas (Tres Navarre #3) Multiple-award-winning author Rick Riordan brings back smart-mouthed Texas P.I.

When a controversial English professor is found shot to death, Tres Navarre — P.I. and Ph.D. — is the only local academic crazy enough to accept the emergency opening at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Police assure him they already have a suspect, so while they wrap up the open-and-shut case, all Tres has to do is teach three classes, grade on a curve ... and walk in a dead man\u0027s shoes.
