He was aware of the score of soldiers starting to surround him, and probably he could have made a few of them perspire for their victory.\n But for what point?\n Westley sagged.\n “Come, sir.” Count Rugen approached. “We must get you safely to your ship.”\n “We are both men of action,” Westley replied. “Lies do not become us.”\n “Well spoken,” said the Count, and with one sudden swing, he clubbed Westley into insensitivity.\n Westley fell like a beaten stone, his last conscious thought being of the Count’s right hand; it was six-fingered, and Westley could never quite remember having encountered that deformity before…\n Six\n The Festivities\n This is one of those chapters again where Professor Bongiorno, of Columbia, the Florinese guru, claims that Morgenstern’s satiric genius is at its fullest flower. (That’s the way this guy talks: ‘fullest flower,’ ‘delicious drolleries’—on and on.)\n This festivities chapter is mostly detailed descriptions of guess what? Bingo! The festivities. It’s like eighty-nine days till the nuptials and every high mucka-muck in Florin has to give a ‘do’ for the couple, and what Morgenstern fills his pages with is how the various richies of the time entertained. What kind of parties, what kind of food, who did the decorations, how did the seating arrangements get settled, all that kind of thing.\n The only interesting part, but it’s not worth going through forty-four pages for, is that Prince Humperdinck gets more and more interested and mannerly toward Buttercup, cutting down even a little on his hunting activities. And, more important, because of the foiling of the kidnapping attempt, three things happen: (1) everyone is pretty well convinced that the plot was engineered by Guilder, so relations between the countries are more than a little strained; (2) Buttercup is just adored by everybody because the rumors are all over that she acted very brave and even came through the Fire Swamp alive and (3) Prince Humperdinck is, at last, in his own land, a hero. He was never popular, what with his hunting fetish and leaving the country to kind of rot once his old man got senile, but the way he foiled the kidnapping made everybody realize that this was some brave fella and they were lucky to have him next in line to lead them.\n Anyhow, these forty-four pages cover just about the first month of party giving. And it’s not till the end of that, that, for my money, things get going again. Buttercup is in bed, pooped, it’s late, the end of another long party, and as she waits for sleep, she wonders what sea Westley is riding on, and the giant and the Spaniard, whatever happened to them? So eventually, in three quick flashbacks, Morgenstern returns to what I think is the story.\n When Inigo regained consciousness, it was still night on the Cliffs of Insanity. Far below, the waters of Florin Channel pounded. Inigo stirred, blinked, tried to rub his eyes, couldn’t.\n His arms were tied together around a tree.\n Inigo blinked again, banishing cobwebs. He had gone on his knees to the man in black, ready for death. Clearly, the victor had other notions. Inigo looked around as best he could, and there it was, the six-fingered sword, glittering in the moonlight like lost magic. Inigo stretched his right leg as far as it would go and managed to touch the handle. Then it was simply a matter of inching the weapon close enough to be graspable by one hand, and then it was an even simpler task to slash his bindings. He was dizzy when he stood, and he rubbed his head behind his ear, where the man in black had struck him. A lump, sizable, to be sure, but not a major problem.\n The major problem was what to do now?\n Vizzini had strict instructions for occasions such as this, when a plan went wrong: Go back to the beginning. Back to the beginning and wait for Vizzini, then regroup, replan, start again. Inigo had even made a little rhyme out of it for Fezzik so the giant would not have problems remembering what to do in time of trouble: “Fool, fool, back to the beginning is the rule.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-79.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: \n What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams? \n As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S.
