This has gone on longer than I planned, so I’m going to repeat the Morgenstern paragraph I interrupted; it’ll read better. Over and out.\\n\\n (At this point in the story, my wife wants it known that she feels violently cheated, not being allowed the scene of reconciliation on the ravine floor between the lovers. My reply to her is simply this: (a) each of God’s beings, from the lowliest on up, is entitled to at least a few moments of genuine privacy. (b) What actually was spoken, while moving enough to those involved at the actual time, flattens like toothpaste when transferred to paper for later reading: “my dove,” “my only,” “bliss, bliss,” et cetera. (c) Nothing of importance in an expository way was related, because every time Buttercup began “Tell me about yourself,” Westley quickly cut her off with “Later, beloved; now is not the time.” However, it should be noted, in fairness to all, that (1) he did weep; (2) her eyes did not remain precisely dry; (3) there was more than one embrace; and (4) both parties admitted that, without any qualifications whatsoever, they were more than a little glad to see each other. Besides, (5) within a quarter of an hour, they were arguing. It began quite innocently, the two of them kneeling, facing each other, Westley holding her perfect face in his quick hands. “When I left you,” he whispered, “you were already more beautiful than anything I dared to dream. In our years apart, my imaginings did their best to improve on your perfection. At night, your face was forever behind my eyes. And now I see that that vision who kept me company in my loneliness was a hag compared to the beauty now before me.”\\n\\n “Enough about my beauty,” Buttercup said. “Everybody always talks about how beautiful I am. I’ve got a mind, Westley. Talk about that.”\\n\\n “Throughout eternity I shall do that very thing,” he told her. “But now we haven’t time.” He made it to his feet. The ravine fall had shaken and battered him, but all his bones survived the trip uncracked. He helped her to her feet.\\n\\n “Westley?” Buttercup said then. “Just before I started down after you, while I was still up there, I could hear you saying something but the words were indistinct.”\\n\\n “I’ve forgotten whatever it was.”\\n\\n “Terrible liar.”\\n\\n He smiled at her and kissed her cheek. “It’s not important, believe me; the past has a way of being past.”\\n\\n “We must not begin with secrets from each other.” She meant it.\\n\\n He could tell that. “Trust me,” he tried.\\n\\n “I do. So tell me your words or I shall be given reason not to.”\\n\\n Westley sighed. “What I was trying to get through to you, beloved sweet; what I was, as a matter of accurate fact, shouting with everything I had left, was: ‘Whatever you do, stay up there! Don’t come down here! Please!’”\\n\\n “You didn’t want to see me.”\\n\\n “Of course I wanted to see you. I just didn’t want to see you down here.”\\n\\n “Why ever not?”\\n\\n “Because now, my precious, we’re more or less kind of trapped. I can’t climb out of here and bring you with me without it taking all day. I can get out myself, most likely, without it taking all day, but with the addition of your lovely bulk, it’s not about to happen.”\\n\\n “Nonsense; you climbed the Cliffs of Insanity, and this isn’t nearly that steep.”\\n\\n “And it took a little out of me too, let me tell you. And after that little effort, I tangled with a fella who knew a little something about fencing. And after that, I spent a few happy moments grappling with a giant. And after that, I had to outfake a Sicilian to death when any mistake meant it was a knife in the throat for you. And after that I’ve run my lungs out a couple of hours. And after that I was pushed two hundred feet down a rock ravine. I’m tired, Buttercup; do you understand tired? I’ve put in a night, is what I’m trying to get through to you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-71.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams? \\n As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S.
