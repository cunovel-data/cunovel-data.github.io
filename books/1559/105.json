{"id":109084,"no":105,"title":"Page 105","content":"When they were gone, the albino came out, pulled the cups from the corpse, decided to burn the body on the garbage pyre back behind the castle. Which meant a wheelbarrow. He hurried up the underground stairs, came out the secret entrance, moved quickly to the main tool shed; all the wheelbarrows were buried back at the rear wall, behind the hoes and rakes and hedge trimmers. The albino made a hissing sound of displeasure and began to pick his way past all the other equipment. This kind of thing always seemed to happen to him when he was in a hurry. The albino hissed again, extra work, extra work, all the time. Wouldn’t you just know it? He finally got the barrow out and was just passing the false and deadly supposed main entrance to the Zoo when “I’m having the devil’s own trouble tracking that scream” was spoken to him, and the albino whirled to find, there, there in the castle grounds, a blade-thin stranger with a sword in his hand. The sword suddenly flicked its way to the albino’s throat. “Where is the man in black?” the swordsman said then. He had a giant scar slanting down each cheek and seemed like no one to trifle with. Whispered: “I know no man in black.” “Did the scream come from that place?” The fellow indicated the main entrance. Nod. “And the throat it came from? I need this man, so be quick!” Whispered: “Westley.” Inigo reasoned: “A sailor? Brought here by Rugen?” Nod. “And I reach him where?” The albino hesitated, then pointed to the deadly entrance. Whispered: “He is on the bottom level. Five levels down.” “Then I have no more need for you. Quiet him a while, Fezzik.” From behind him, the albino was aware of a giant shadow moving. Funny, he thought—the last thing he remembered—I thought that was a tree. Inigo was on fire now. There was no stopping him. Fezzik hesitated by the main door. “Why would he tell the truth?” “He’s a zookeeper threatened with death. Why would he lie?” “That doesn’t follow.” “I don’t care!” Inigo said sharply, and, in fact, he didn’t. He knew in his heart the man in black was down there. There was no other reason for Fezzik to find him, for Fezzik to know of Rugen, for everything to be coming together after so many years of waiting. If there was a God, then there was a man in black waiting. Inigo knew that. He knew it. And, of course, he was absolutely right. But again, of course, there were many things he did not know. That the man in black was dead, for one. That the entrance they were taking was the wrong one, for another, a false one, set up to foil those, like himself, who did not belong. There were spitting cobras down there, though what would actually come at him would be worse. These things he did not know either. But his father had to be revenged. And the man in black would figure out how. That was enough for Inigo. And so, with an urgency that would soon turn to deep regret, he and Fezzik approached the Zoo of Death. Seven The Wedding Inigo allowed Fezzik to open the door, not because he wished to hide behind the giant’s strength but, rather, because the giant’s strength was crucial to their entering: someone would have to force the thick door from its hinges, and that was right up Fezzik’s alley. “It’s open,” Fezzik said, simply turning the knob, peering inside. “Open?” Inigo hesitated. “Close it then. There must be something wrong. Why would something as valuable as the Prince’s private zoo be left unlocked?” “It smells of animals something awful in there,” Fezzik said. “Did I get a whiff!”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-105.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?
