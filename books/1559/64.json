You’ll learn nothing from me, that I promise you.” “I have already learned everything from you,” said the Sicilian. “I know where the poison is.” “Only a genius could have deduced as much.” “How fortunate for me that I happen to be one,” said the hunchback, growing more and more amused now. “You cannot frighten me,” said the man in black, but there was fear all through his voice. “Shall we drink then?” “Pick, choose, quit dragging it out, you don’t know, you couldn’t know.” The Sicilian only smiled at the outburst. Then a strange look crossed his features and he pointed off behind the man in black. “What in the world can that be?” he asked. The man in black turned around and looked. “I don’t see anything.” “Oh, well, I could have sworn I saw something, no matter.” The Sicilian began to laugh. “I don’t understand what’s so funny,” said the man in black. “Tell you in a minute,” said the hunchback. “But first let’s drink.” And he picked up his own wine goblet. The man in black picked up the one in front of him. They drank. “You guessed wrong,” said the man in black. “You only think I guessed wrong,” said the Sicilian, his laughter ringing louder. “That’s what’s so funny. I switched glasses when your back was turned.” There was nothing for the man in black to say. “Fool!” cried the hunchback. “You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is ‘Never get involved in a land war in Asia,’ but only slightly less well known is this: ‘Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.’” He was quite cheery until the iocane powder took effect. The man in black stepped quickly over the corpse, then roughly ripped the blindfold from the Princess’s eyes. “I heard everything that happ—” Buttercup began, and then she said “Oh” because she had never been next to a dead man before. “You killed him,” she whispered finally. “I let him die laughing,” said the man in black. “Pray I do as much for you.” He lifted her, slashed her bonds away, put her on her feet, started to pull her along. “Please,” Buttercup said. “Give me a moment to gather myself.” The man in black released his grip.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-64.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?
