With a roar he charged across the corridor and when he was close he left the castle floor with both feet and the door splintered.\n “Thank you, thank you,” Inigo said, already halfway through the broken door.\n “What do I do now though?” Fezzik called.\n “Back to Westley,” Inigo answered, in full flight now, beginning chasing through a series of rooms.\n “Stupid,” Fezzik punished himself with, and he turned and rejoined Westley. Only Westley was no longer there. Fezzik could feel the panic starting inside him. There were half a dozen possible corridors. “Which which which?” Fezzik said, trying to figure it out, trying for once in his life to do something right. “You’ll pick the wrong one, knowing you,” he said out loud, and then he took a corridor and started hurrying along it as fast as he could.\n He did pick the wrong one.\n Westley was alone now.\n Inigo was gaining. He could see, instant to instant, flashes of the fleeing noble in the next room, and when he reached that place, the Count would have made it into the room beyond. But each time, Inigo was gaining. By 5:40, he felt confident he would, after a chase of twenty-five years, be alone in a room with his revenge.\n By 5:48, Buttercup felt quite sure she would be dead. It was still a minute before that as she stood staring at the Prince’s knives. The most lethal looked to be the one most used, the Florinese dagger. Pointed at one end, it entered easily, growing into a triangular shape by the hilt. For quicker bleeding, it was said. They were made in varying sizes, and the Prince’s looked to be one of the largest, being wrist thick where it joined the handle. She pulled it from the wall, put it to her heart.\n “There are always too few perfect breasts in this world; leave yours alone,” she heard. And there was Westley on the bed. It was 5:48, and she knew that she would never die.\n Westley, for his part, assumed he had till 6:15 for his hour to be up. That was, of course, when an hour was up, only he didn’t have an hour; only forty minutes. Till 5:55, actually. Seven minutes more. But, as has been said, he had no way of knowing that.\n And Inigo had no way of knowing that Count Rugen had a Florinese dagger. Or that he was expert with the thing. It took Inigo until 5:41 before he actually cornered the Count. In a billiard room. “Hello,” he was about to say. “My name is Inigo Montoya; you killed my father; prepare to die.” What he actually got out was somewhat less: “Hello, my name is Ini—”\n And then the dagger rearranged his insides. The force of the throw sent him staggering backward into the wall. The rush of blood weakened him so quickly he could not keep his feet. “Domingo, Domingo,” he whispered, and then he was, at forty-two minutes after five, lost on his knees…\n Buttercup was baffled by Westley’s behavior. She rushed to him, expecting to be met halfway in a wild embrace. Instead, he only smiled at her and remained where he was, lying on the Prince’s pillows, a sword beside his body.\n Buttercup continued the journey alone and fell onto her very one and darling Westley.\n “Gently,” he said.\n “At a time like this that’s all you can think to say? ‘Gently’?”\n “Gently,” Westley repeated, not so gently this time.\n She got off him. “Are you angry at me for getting married?” she wondered.\n “You are not married,” he said, softly. Strange his voice was. “Not in my church or any other.”\n “But this old man did pronounce—”\n “Widows happen. Every day—don’t they, Your Highness?” And now his voice was stronger as he addressed the Prince, who entered, muddy boots in hand.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-126.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: \n What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams? \n As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S.
