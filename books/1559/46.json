I only said I would pay what it was worth.” Domingo whirled back, eyes bright. “You quibbled. You haggled. Art was involved and you saw only money. Beauty was here for the taking and you saw only your fat purse. You have lost nothing; there is no more reason for your remaining here. Please go.” “The sword,” the noble said. “The sword belongs to my son,” Domingo said. “I give it to him now. It is forever his. Good-by.” “You’re a peasant and a fool and I want my sword.” “You’re an enemy of art and I pity your ignorance,” Domingo said. They were the last words he ever uttered. The noble killed him then, with no warning; a flash of the nobleman’s sword and Domingo’s heart was torn to pieces. Inigo screamed. He could not believe it; it had not happened. He screamed again. His father was fine; soon they would have tea. He could not stop screaming. The village heard. Twenty men were at the door. The nobleman pushed his way through them. “That man attacked me. See? He holds a sword. He attacked me and I defended myself. Now move from my way.” It was lies, of course, and everyone knew it. But he was a noble so what was there to do? They parted, and the nobleman mounted his horse. “Coward!” The nobleman whirled. “Pig!” Again the crowd parted. Inigo stood there, holding the six-fingered sword, repeating his words: “Coward. Pig. Killer.” “Someone tend the babe before he oversteps himself,” the noble said to the crowd. Inigo ran forward then, standing in front of the nobleman’s horse, blocking the nobleman’s path. He raised the six-fingered sword with both his hands and cried, “I, Inigo Montoya, do challenge you, coward, pig, killer, ass, fool, to battle.” “Get him out of my way. Move the infant.” “The infant is ten and he stays,” Inigo said. “Enough of your family is dead for one day; be content,” said the noble. “When you beg me for your breath, then I shall be contented. Now dismount!” The nobleman dismounted. “Draw your sword.” The nobleman unsheathed his killing weapon. “I dedicate your death to my father,” Inigo said. “Begin.” They began. It was no match, of course. Inigo was disarmed in less than a minute. But for the first fifteen seconds or so, the noble was uneasy. During those fifteen seconds, strange thoughts crossed his mind. For even at the age of ten, Inigo’s genius was there. Disarmed, Inigo stood very straight. He said not a word, begged nothing. “I’m not going to kill you,” the nobleman said. “Because you have talent and you’re brave. But you’re also lacking in manners, and that’s going to get you in trouble if you’re not careful. So I shall help you as you go through life, by leaving you with a reminder that bad manners are to be avoided.” And with that his blade flashed. Two times. And Inigo’s face began to bleed. Two rivers of blood poured from his forehead to his chin, one crossing each cheek. Everyone watching knew it then: the boy was scarred for life. Inigo would not fall. The world went white behind his eyes but he would not go to ground. The blood continued to pour. The nobleman replaced his sword, remounted, rode on. It was only then that Inigo allowed the darkness to claim him. He awoke to Yeste’s face. “I was beaten,” Inigo whispered. “I failed him.” Yeste could only say, “Sleep.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-46.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?
