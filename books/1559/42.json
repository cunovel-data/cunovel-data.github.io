{"id":109029,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"Nope.\n You went to Madrid; because Madrid was where lived the famous Yeste, and if you had the money and he had the time, you got your weapon. Yeste was fat and jovial and one of the richest and most honored men in the city. And he should have been. He made wonderful swords, and noblemen bragged to each other when they owned an original Yeste.\n But sometimes—not often, mind you, maybe once a year, maybe less—a request would come in for a weapon that was more than even Yeste could make. When that happened, did Yeste say, “Alas, I am sorry, I cannot do it”?\n Nope.\n What he said was, “Of course, I’d be delighted, fifty per cent down payment please, the rest before delivery, come back in a year, thank you very much.”\n The next day he would set out for the hills behind Toledo.\n “So, Domingo,” Yeste would call out when he reached Inigo’s father’s hut.\n “So, Yeste,” Domingo Montoya would return from the hut doorway.\n Then the two men would embrace and Inigo would come running up and Yeste would rumple his hair and then Inigo would make tea while the two men talked.\n “I need you,” Yeste would always begin.\n Domingo would grunt.\n “This very week I have accepted a commission to make a sword for a member of the Italian nobility. It is to be jewel encrusted at the handle and the jewels are to spell out the name of his present mistress and—”\n “No.”\n That single word and that alone. But it was enough. When Domingo Montoya said “no” it meant nothing else but.\n Inigo, busy with the tea, knew what would happen now: Yeste would use his charm.\n “No.”\n Yeste would use his wealth.\n “No.”\n His wit, his wonderful gift for persuasion.\n “No.”\n He would beg, entreat, promise, pledge.\n “No.”\n Insults. Threats.\n “No.”\n Finally, genuine tears.\n “No. More tea, Yeste?”\n “Perhaps another cup, thank you—” Then, big: “WHY WON’t YOU?”\n Inigo hurried to refill their cups so as never to miss a word. He knew they had been brought up together, had known each other sixty years, had never not loved one another deeply, and it thrilled him when he could hear them arguing. That was the strange thing: arguing was all they ever did.\n “Why? My fat friend asks me why? He sits there on his world-class ass and has the nerve to ask me why? Yeste. Come to me sometime with a challenge. Once, just once, ride up and say, ‘Domingo, I need a sword for an eighty-year-old man to fight a duel,’ and I would embrace you and cry ‘Yes!’ Because to make a sword for an eighty-year-old man to survive a duel, that would be something. Because the sword would have to be strong enough to win, yet light enough not to tire his weary arm. I would have to use my all to perhaps find an unknown metal, strong but very light, or devise a different formula for a known one, mix some bronze with some iron and some air in a way ignored for a thousand years. I would kiss your smelly feet for an opportunity like that, fat Yeste. But to make a stupid sword with stupid jewels in the form of stupid initials so some stupid Italian can thrill his stupid mistress, no. That, I will not do.”\n “For the last time I ask you. Please.”\n “For the last time I tell you, I am sorry. No.”\n “I gave my word the sword would be made,” Yeste said. “I cannot make it. In all the world no one can but you, and you say no. Which means I have gone back on a commitment. Which means I have lost my honor. Which means that since honor is the only thing in the world I care about, and since I cannot live without it, I must die. And since you are my dearest friend, I may as well die now, with you, basking in the warmth of your affection.” And here Yeste would pull out a knife. It was a magnificent thing, a gift from Domingo on Yeste’s wedding day. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-42.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: \n What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams? \n As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S.
