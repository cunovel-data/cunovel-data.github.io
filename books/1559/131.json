I was worried about you back on the bed there. Your eyes rolled up into your head and everything.”\\n\\n “I suppose I was dying again, so I asked the Lord of Permanent Affection for the strength to live the day. Clearly, the answer came in the affirmative.”\\n\\n “I didn’t know there was such a Fellow,” Buttercup said.\\n\\n “Neither did I, in truth, but if He didn’t exist, I didn’t much want to either.”\\n\\n The four great horses seemed almost to fly toward Florin Channel.\\n\\n “It appears to me as if we’re doomed, then,” Buttercup said.\\n\\n Westley looked at her. “Doomed, madam?”\\n\\n “To be together. Until one of us dies.”\\n\\n “I’ve done that already, and I haven’t the slightest intention of ever doing it again,” Westley said.\\n\\n Buttercup looked at him. “Don’t we sort of have to sometime?”\\n\\n “Not if we promise to outlive each other, and I make that promise now.”\\n\\n Buttercup looked at him. “Oh my Westley, so do I.”\\n\\n ‘And they lived happily ever after,’ my father said.\\n\\n ‘Wow,’ I said.\\n\\n He looked at me. ‘You’re not pleased?’\\n\\n ‘No, no, it’s just, it came so quick, the ending, it surprised me. I thought there ‘d be a little more, is all. I mean, was the pirate ship waiting or was that just a rumor like it said?’\\n\\n ‘Complain to Mr. Morgenstern. “And they lived happily ever after” is how it ends.’\\n\\n The truth was, my father was fibbing. I spent my whole life thinking it ended that way, up until I did this abridgement. Then I glanced at the last page. This is how Morgenstern ends it.\\n\\n Buttercup looked at him. “Oh my Westley, so do I.” From behind them suddenly, closer than they imagined, they could hear the roar of Humperdinck: “Stop them! Cut them off!” They were, admittedly, startled, but there was no reason for worry: they were on the fastest horses in the kingdom, and the lead was already theirs.\\n\\n However, this was before Inigo’s wound reopened; and Westley relapsed again; and Fezzik took the wrong turn; and Buttercup’s horse threw a shoe. And the night behind them was filled with the crescendoing sound of pursuit…\\n\\n That’s Morgenstern’s ending, a ‘Lady or the Tiger?’-type effect (this was before ‘The Lady or the Tiger?,’ remember). Now, he was a satirist, so he left it that way, and my father was, I guess I realized too late, a romantic, so he ended it another way.\\n\\n Well, I’m an abridger, so I’m entitled to a few ideas of my own. Did they make it? Was the pirate ship there? You can answer it for yourself, but, for me, I say yes it was. And yes, they got away. And got their strength back and had lots of adventures and more than their share of laughs.\\n\\n But that doesn’t mean I think they had a happy ending either. Because, in my opinion anyway, they squabbled a lot, and Buttercup lost her looks eventually, and one day Fezzik lost a fight and some hot-shot kid whipped Inigo with a sword and Westley was never able to really sleep sound because of Humperdinck maybe being on the trail.\\n\\n I’m not trying to make this a downer, understand. I mean, I really do think that love is the best thing in the world, except for cough drops. But I also have to say, for the umpty-umpth time, that life isn’t fair. It’s just fairer than death, that’s all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-131.html","bookId":1559,"book":{"id":1559,"title":"The Princess Bride","description":"Storyline: What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams? \\n As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S.
