{"id":38092,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"\u0027Tis a dull thing to travel like a mill horse, Still in the place he was born in, round and blinded. Beaumont and Fletcher. A novel-maker may claim a privilege which his betters must forego. So, in the teeth of dramatic unities, let the story leap a chasm of some two years. Not that the void was a void to Morton. His nature spurred him into perpetual action; but his wanderings were over at length; and he and Meredith sat under the porch of Morton\u0027s house, a few miles from town. The features of the latter were swarthy from exposures, while those of his friend were somewhat pale, and had the expression of one insufferably bored. \"Colonel, you are the luckiest fellow I know. Here you have been following the backbone of the continent from Darien to the head of the Missouri, mixing yourself up with Spaniards and Aztecs, poking sticks into the crater of Popocatapetl, and living hand and glove with Blackfeet and Assinnaboins, while I have been doing penance among bonds and mortgages, and title deeds and leases. My father has thrown up responsibility and gone to Europe—and so has every body else—and left all on my shoulders.\" \"Your time will come.\" \"I hope so.\" \"But what news is there?\" \"Nothing.\" \"What, nothing since I went away?\" \"The old story. You know it as well as I. Now and then, a new engagement came out. Mrs. A. approved it, and Mrs. B. didn\u0027t; and then characters were discussed on both sides. Something has been said of the balls, the opera, and what not; with the usual talk about the wickedness of the democrats and the fanaticism of the abolitionists.\" \"You appear to have led a gay life.\" \"Very!—we need a war, an invasion,—something of the sort. It would put life into us, and rid us of a great deal of nonsense. You were born with a stimulus in yourself, and can stand this stagnant sort of existence; but I need something more lively.\" \"Then go with me on my next journey.\" \"Are you thinking of another already? Rest in peace, and thank Heaven that you have come home in a whole skin.\" \"I have done the North American continent; but there are four more left, not to mention the islands.\" \"And you mean to see them all?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Your science is a convenient hobby. It carries you wherever you fancy to go.\" \"You could not do better than go with me.\" \"I know it; but, if wishes were horses—— I am training Dick to take my place. I am a model elder brother to that youngster in the way of cultivating his mind and morals; and when I have him up to the mark, I shall gain a year\u0027s furlough for my pains. But when is your next journey to begin—next week?\" \"No, I mean to pin myself down here, and dig like a mole, for the next ten months, at least.\" \"If I had not had ocular proof of what a determined dig you can be, I should set down your studies as mere humbug.\" \"But I wish to hear the news.\" \"I would tell it willingly, if I knew any.\" \"Have the Primroses come home from Europe yet?\" \"Yes.\" \"And the Everills?\" \"I believe not.\" \"Nor the Leslies, I suppose.\" \"For a reasonably sensible and straightforward fellow, you have a queer way of making inquiries. You question like a lady\u0027s letter, with the pith in the postscript. You ask after the Primroses and the Everills, a stupid, priggish set, for whom you care nothing, as earnestly as if you were in love with them, and then grow indifferent when you come to the Leslies, whom you like.\" \"Did I?\" said Morton, in some discomposure; \"I ask their pardon. Have they come home?\" \"Not yet, but I believe they mean to come as soon as they have staid their year out.\" \"And that will be very soon—early in the spring, or sooner.\" \"Now I think of it, I made the acquaintance, a few evenings ago, of a person who, I believe, is a relation or connection of yours—Miss Fanny Euston.\" \"O, yes, she is my third, fourth, or fifth cousin, or something of that sort; but I have not seen her since she was ten years old. She was a great romp, then, and very plain.\" \"That last failing is cured. She has grown very handsome.\" \"The first failing ought to be cured, too, by this time.\" \"I am not so clear on that point. She is a girl with an abundance of education, and a good deal of a certain kind of accomplishment—music, and so on—but no breeding at all. If she had had the training of good society, she would have been one of a thousand. As it is she cares for nobody, and does and says whatever comes into her mind, without the least regard to consequences or appearances.\" \"Does she affect naturalness, independence, and all that?\" \"No, she affects nothing. The material is admirable. It only needs to be refined, polished, and toned down. It\u0027s unlucky, colonel, but in this world every thing worth having is broken in pieces and mixed with something that one doesn\u0027t want. It\u0027s an even balance, good and bad; there\u0027s no use in going off into raptures about any thing. One thing is certain, though; this cousin of yours has character enough to supply material for a dozen Miss Primroses, without any visible diminution.\" \"I should like to see her. I\u0027ll go to-morrow.\" \"You\u0027d better. But now tell me something more about your journey.\" And, in reply to his friend\u0027s questions, Morton proceeded to relate such incidents as had befallen him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78623.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
