{"id":38094,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX.","content":"Elle ne manque jamais de saisir promptement L\u0027apparente lueur du moindre attachement, D\u0027en semer la nouvelle avec beaucoup de joie,—Le Tartufe. Among Morton\u0027s acquaintance was a certain Miss Blanche Blondel. They had been schoolmates when children; and as, at a later date, Miss Blanche had been fond of making long visits to a friend in Cambridge, during term time, Morton, in common with many others, had a college acquaintance with her, so that they were now on a footing of easy intercourse. Not that he liked her. On the contrary, she had inspired him with a very emphatic aversion; but being rather a skirmisher on the outposts of society, than enrolled in the main battalion, she was anxious to make the most of the acquaintance she had. She had the eyes of an Argus, and was as sly, smooth, watchful, and rusée as a tortoise shell cat; wonderfully dexterous at finding or making gossip, and unwearied in sowing it, broadcast, to the right and left. One evening Morton was at a ball, crowded to the verge of suffocation. At length he found himself in a corner from which there was no retreat, while the stately proportions of Mrs. Frederic Goldenberg barred his onward progress. But when that distinguished lady chanced to move aside, she revealed the countenance of Miss Blondel, beaming on him like the moon after an eclipse. She nodded and smiled. There was no escape. Morton smiled hypocritically, and said, \"Good evening.\" Blanche, as usual, was eager for conversation, and, after a few commonplaces, she said, turning up her eyes at him with an arch expression,— \"I have a piece of news to tell you, Mr. Morton.\" \"Ah!\" replied Morton, expecting something disagreeable. \"A piece of news that you will be charmed to hear.\" \"Indeed.\" \"Why, how cold you are! And I know that, in your heart, you are burning to hear it.\" \"If you think so, you are determined to give my patience a hard schooling.\" \"Well, I will not tantalize you any more. Miss Edith Leslie sailed from Liverpool for home last Wednesday.\" \"Ah!\" \"How cold you are again! Are you not glad to hear it?\" \"Certainly—all her friends will be glad to hear it.\" \"Upon my word, Mr. Morton, you are worse and worse. When a gentleman dances twice with a young lady on class day, and twice at Mrs. Fanfaron\u0027s ball, and joins her in the street besides, has she not a right to feel hurt when he hears with such profound indifference of her coming home after a year\u0027s absence?\" Morton could hardly restrain the extremity of his distaste and impatience. \"Miss Leslie, I imagine, would spend very little thought upon the matter.\" And he hastened, first to change the conversation, and then to close it altogether. Having escaped from his fair informant, he remained divided between pleasure at the tidings, and annoyance at the manner in which they had been told. In a few days Miss Leslie arrived. Her beauty had matured during her absence. She was conspicuously and brilliantly handsome, and was admired accordingly,—a fact which, though she could not but be conscious of it, seemed to affect her very little. Morton found her but slightly changed, with the same polished and quiet frankness, the same lively conversation, not without a tinge of sarcasm, and the same enthusiasm of character, betraying itself by an earnestness of manner, and never by any extravagance of expression. He had many opportunities of seeing her, Miss Blanche Blondel being but rarely present, and, in his growing admiration of her, the charms of his unbridled cousin faded more and more from his memory.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78625.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
