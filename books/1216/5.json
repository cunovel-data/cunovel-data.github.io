{"id":38090,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V.","content":"Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm; Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind\u0027s sway, That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening prey.—Gray. It was a week before \"class day,\"—that eventful day which was virtually to close the college career of Morton and his contemporaries. The little janitor, commonly called Paddy O\u0027Flinn, was ringing the evening prayer bell from the cupola of Harvard Hall,—its tone was dull and muffled, some graceless sophomore having lately painted it white, inside and out,—and the students were mustering at the summons. The sedate and the gay, the tender freshman and the venerable senior, the prosperous city beau and the awkward country bumpkin, one and all were filing from their respective quarters towards the chapel in University Hall. The bell ceased; the loiterers quickened their steps; the last belated freshman, with the dread of the proctor before his eyes, bounded frantically up the steps; and for a brief space all was silence and solitude. Then there was a murmuring, rushing sound, as of a coming tempest, and University Hall disgorged its contents, casting forth the freshmen and juniors at one door, and the sophomores and seniors at the other. Of these last was Morton, who, with three or four of his class, walked across the college yard, towards the great gateway. By his side was a young man named Rosny, carelessly dressed, but with a lively, dare-devil face, and the look of a good-natured game cock. \"I shall be sorry to leave this place,\" said Morton; \"I like it. I like the elms, and the gravel walks, and the scurvy old brick and mortar buildings.\" \"Then I am not of your mind,\" said Rosny; \"gravel or mud, brickbats or paving stones, they are the same to me, the world over. Halloo, Wren,\" to a mustachioed youth who just then joined them; \"we are bound to your room.\" \"That\u0027s as it should be. But where are the rest?\" \"Coming—all in good time; here\u0027s one of them.\" A dapper little person approached, with a shining beaver, yellow kid gloves, a switch cane, and a very stiff but somewhat dashing cravat, surmounted by a round and rubicund face. \"Ah, Chester!\" exclaimed Wren; \"the very man we were looking for. Come and take a glass of punch at my room.\" \"Punch, indeed!\" replied Chester, whose face had changed from a prim expression to one of great hilarity the moment he saw his friends—\"no, no, gentlemen, I renounce punch and all its works. The pure unmixed, the pure juice of the grape for me.\" \"But, Chester,\" urged Wren, \"won\u0027t the pure mountain dew be a sufficient inducement?\" \"The good company will be a sufficient inducement,\" said Chester, waving his hand,—\"the good company, gentlemen,—and the good liquor. But what have we here? Meredith and Vinal walking side by side. Good Heavens, what a conjunction!\" The objects of Chester\u0027s astonishment, on a flattering invitation from Wren, joined the party, which, however, was weakened by the temporary secession of Rosny, who, pleading an errand in the village, left them with a promise to rejoin them soon. His place was in a few moments more than supplied by a new party of recruits, among whom was Stubb. Arrived at Wren\u0027s room, the desk and other appliances of study were banished from the table; bottles and glasses usurped their place, and the company composed themselves for conversation, most of them permitting their chairs to stand quietly on all fours, though one or two, like heathen Yankees from the backwoods, forced them to rear rampant on the hind legs, the occupant\u0027s feet resting on the ledge over the fireplace. A few minutes passed, when a quick, firm step came up the stairs, and Rosny entered. \"How are you again, Dick?\" said Meredith. \"Good evening, Mr. Rosny,\" echoed Stubb, who sat alone on the window seat. \"Eh? what\u0027s that?\" demanded Rosny, turning sharp round upon the last speaker, with a face divided between indignation and laughter. \"I said, \u0027Good evening,\u0027\" replied Stubb, much disconcerted. \"And why didn\u0027t you say, \u0027Good morning,\u0027 yesterday, eh?—when I met you in Boston, eh? He gave me the cut direct,\" turning to the company. \"Mr. Benjamin Stubb, here, gave me the cut direct! It was the pepper-and-salt coat and the thunder-and-lightning breeches that Stubb couldn\u0027t think of bowing to when he was walking in —— Street, with a lady. Look here, Stubb,\"—again facing the victim,—\"what do you take me for? and what the devil do you take yourself for? I know your dirty family history. Your grandfather was a bricklayer, and the Lord knows who your great grandfather was. The best Huguenot blood of France runs in my veins! My ancestors were fighting at Ivry and Jarnac, while yours were peddling coal and potatoes about London streets, or digging mud in a ditch, for any thing you or I know to the contrary.\" Stubb gasped. \"Your father has a crest painted on his carriage; but where did he get it? Why, Cribb, the engraver, stole it for him out of the British peerage.\" Stubb, who was weak and timorous, here rose in great confusion, muttered something about conduct unbecoming to a gentleman, and meaning to require an explanation, and abruptly left the room. \"That job is finished,\" said Rosny, composedly seating himself. \"His bill is settled for him.\" \"But, Dick,\" said Morton, who had been laughing in his sleeve during the scene, \"do you want to be considered as a Frenchman or an American?\" \"I\u0027m an American,\" answered Rosny—\"an American and a democrat, every inch.\" Rosny had adopted democratic principles and habits partly out of spite against the class to which Stubb belonged, and which he was pleased to designate as the \"codfish aristocracy,\" and partly because he thought that he could thus most effectually gain the ends of his impatient, hankering ambition. His ancestor, the head of an eminent Huguenot race, had been driven to America by the persecutions which followed the revocation of the edict of Nantes. The family had lived ever since in poverty and obscurity; yet this fiery young democrat nourished an inordinate pride of birth, and never forgot that he was descended from a line of warlike nobles. \"No, no,\" said Rosny, as Morton pushed a glass towards him, \"drinking is against my rule— Well, as it\u0027s about the last time,\"—filling the glass,—\"here\u0027s to you all.\" \"The last time!\" said Morton; \"that\u0027s a dismal word. If my next four years are as pleasant as these last have been, I will never complain of them.\" \"I tell you, boys,\" said Meredith, who was tranquilly puffing at his cigar, \"the cream of our lives is skimmed already. Rough and tumble, hurry and worry—that will be the story with most of us, more or less, to the end of our days.\" \"Rough and tumble!\" exclaimed Rosny; \"so much the better. \u0027Scots play best at the roughest game\u0027—that\u0027s just my case. Who wants to be always paddling about on smooth water? Close reefed topsails, a gale astern, and breakers all round—that\u0027s the game.\" \"Every one to his taste,\" said Chester, shrugging his shoulders. \"I suppose a salamander loves the fire, but I don\u0027t. \u0027The race of ambition\u0027—\u0027the unconquerable will\u0027—pshaw! Cui bono? One chases after his object, and when he has got it, he turns from it, and chases another. I profess the philosophy of Horace—enjoy the hour as it flies. Ah! he was a model man, a man after my own heart, a gentleman and a man of the world. He could drink his Falernian, and thank the gods for their gifts.\" Rosny whispered in Morton\u0027s ear, \"Chester ought to have been born a century ago, among the John Bulls, up in the cockloft of Brazen Nose College, or some such antediluvian hole.\" In spite of these derogatory remarks, Chester, besides being one of the best scholars in the class, was noted for a social, jovial disposition, which, though, like Fluellen\u0027s valor, a little out of fashion, made him a general favorite. \"Speaking of the next four years,\" said Wren, \"I wonder what plans each of us has made for that time. For my part, I have no plan at all, and should be glad to profit by the suggestions of the rest. Come, Chester, what do you mean to do?\" \"Expatiate,\" said Chester, expanding his hands, and thereby revealing an odd little antique ring which he wore; \"take mine ease, roaming, like the bee, from blossom to blossom. I will leave the earnest men—bah!—the men with a mission—to grub on in their vocation. I will renounce this land of cotton mills and universal suffrage. First for Paris, to walk the Boulevards, and go to the masked balls and the opera;—vive la bagatelle!—then for Rome, to saunter through the Vatican and the picture galleries,—but not to moralize with a long face over fallen grandeur, and the mutability of human affairs. No, no, gentlemen, I belong to another school of philosophy. I will sit among the ruins of the Forum, and laugh, like Democritus, at the image of Death. Then I will recreate myself at Capri, like the C?sars before me; then enjoy the dolce far niente at Florence, and read the Tuscan poets in the shades of Vallombrosa.\" \"But, Chester,\" interposed Wren, \"don\u0027t you ever mean to marry and settle down?\" \"I object to that phrase, \u0027settle down.\u0027 It calls up disagreeable images. It reminds one of the backwoods, log cabins, men in shirt sleeves, and piles of pine boards and lumber. Yes, certainly, I mean to marry. What man of taste would leave matrimony out of his scheme of life? One likes to gather his treasures round him, his pictures, his vases, and statues; and how can he adorn his rooms with an ornament more exquisite—where can he find a piece of furniture more charmingly moulded—than a beautiful woman?\" This flourish, between jest and earnest, he pronounced with a graceful wave of his hand. \"If, when you have married your beautiful woman,\" said Morton, \"you find you have caught a Tartar, it will serve you right.\" \"Hear him,\" said Chester; \"hear the barbarian. He will always be conjuring up some image of disquiet. \u0027Rest, rest, perturbed spirit.\u0027\" \"He could not rest, if he tried,\" said Horace Vinal. \"No, he is one of those unfortunates who lie under a sentence of endless activity. It is a disease, with which men are afflicted for the sins of their ancestors; and for the sins of mine I was born among a whole nation of such. Perpetual motion, bustle and whirl,—I grow dizzy to think of it. They cannot rest themselves, and will not let any one else rest. Always pursuing, always doing, never enjoying. A true American cannot enjoy. He would build a steam saw mill in Arcadia, and dam up the four rivers of Paradise for cotton factories.\" \"But, Chester,\" said Wren, \"that is not at all like Morton; you know he hates utilitarianism.\" \"Yes, but still he cannot rest. He would not build saw mills and dams; but he would be sure to fire his rifle at some of Adam\u0027s live stock, and set all Eden by the ears. Come, Morton, I have told the company my plans. Let us hear what yours are.\" \"My guardian wishes me to enter the law school.\" \"You are twenty-one now,\" said Vinal, \"and can do as you please.\" Vinal was a very tall and slender young man, with a strongly marked face, though thin and pale; a grave, thoughtful eye, and compressed lips, expressing a kind of nervous self-control. His dress was very elaborate and scrupulous, though without the smallest trace of foppery. He was less popular in the class than Morton, but had the reputation of greater talents. This he owed, perhaps, to his habitual reserve; for every one thought that he understood Morton thoroughly, while few pretended to fathom the silent and self-contained Vinal. \"I should like well enough to study law,\" was Morton\u0027s non-committal answer. \"I thought, Morton, that you were more of a philosopher. Here you are, a young fellow, full of blood, and worth half a million, and yet you speak of buckling down to the law. That is all well enough for poor dogs like me, who go into the mill from necessity. We drudge on for twenty years or more, till we have scraped together a competency, or something better, perhaps, and then we find that we have forgotten how to enjoy it. We have grown so used to harness that we are good for nothing out of it, and sacrifice body and soul to our profession. You have reached already the point that we are straining for. The world is all before you, man; launch out and enjoy yourself.\" \"Didn\u0027t you just say,\" asked Rosny, \"that Morton couldn\u0027t rest, if he tried?\" \"I said he could not rest, but I did not say he could not enjoy himself. Look at him: his cheek is ruddier and browner than any of us. Nobody would believe that a fellow like that was not made to enjoy life. I know Morton. He could roam from blossom to blossom, as Chester says, with as good a will as any body. He has an eye for the fair sex, correct as he is at present. He knows a pretty face from a plain one. The devil will catch him yet with a black eye and a rosy cheek.\" \"Then,\" said Morton, \"he will show his good opinion of my taste.\" Rosny, who had his own reasons for disliking Vinal, here broke in without ceremony,— \"Be gad, Vinal, he will bait his hook differently when he fishes for you.\" \"How will that be, Dick?\" said Meredith. \"With a five dollar bank note, and a lying puff in a newspaper; and Vinal will jump at it like a mackerel at a red rag.\" Vinal laughed, but with a bad grace. \"Riches and fame!\" said Chester, anxious to smooth away all traces of irritation—\"riches and fame! I call those legitimate objects of pursuit; and the black eye is positively praiseworthy. Come, Morton, let us hear your plan. You have not told it yet.\" \"I defer to Rosny—he is my senior. Dick, some ten or twelve years from this, I suppose I shall vote against you for the presidency.\" \"Thank you. By that time you will have no whig party left to vote with. The democrats will have it all their own way.\" \"I have often wondered what could have induced a driving man of the world like you to come to college at all. You have been here more than a year; and in the same time, with your previous knowledge, you might have learned as much any where else at half the cost. You are not the fellow to regard a degree of A. M. with superstitious veneration.\" \"You are right there, colonel. I am of no kith nor kin to some of your New England old fogies, who would give their souls for a D. D. or an LL. D.—and get it, too, though they know no more Greek or Hebrew than I know of Choctaw, and can barely manage to stumble along through the Latin Testament. What\u0027s a piece of sheep\u0027s skin to me? Humbug is the current coin all the world over, and just as much in this free and enlightened country as any where else. I have schemes on foot,—not political,—no matter what they are,—out in the western country; and I happen to know that a degree from Harvard University is the medicine that suits my case; with that for my credentials, I shall carry it over all competitors. Yes, boys, gammon is the word; and the man who would rise in the world must use the stepping stones.\" \"You\u0027re a victim of the national disease, Rosny,\" said Chester. \"Rising in the world!—that\u0027s the idea that ruins us. It\u0027s that that makes us lean, starveling, nervous, restless, dyspeptic, hypochondriac,—the most prosperous and most uncomfortable people on earth. Sit down, man, and take your ease. What garden will thrive if every plant in it must be dug up every day, and set out in a better place?\" \"Ah, that\u0027s good doctrine for you. You have got nothing to gain, and a good deal to lose. Stand up for the status quo, old boy; I would, in your place. Look at me, though. I was cut adrift at fourteen,—parents dead,—not a cent in my pocket,—and since then I have tumbled along through the world as I could. You can\u0027t kill me. I have more lives than a cat. I have been thrown on my back a dozen times; but the harder I was flung down, the higher I bounced up again. Why, I have known the time when I was glad to earn a shilling by shovelling snow off a sidewalk. I have tried my hand at every thing,—printer\u0027s work, lecturing, politics, editing, keeping school,—and do you suppose I shall be content to rest in the mud all my days? Not a bit of it. I know my cue better. The time will come when you\u0027ll see me shooting up like a rocket.\" Here a broad glare against the window interrupted him, and, looking out, his auditors saw a bonfire blazing with peculiar splendor under the windows of the chamber where the Faculty were at that moment in solemn session. Three proctors and a tutor were hastening towards the scene of outrage, when a stentorian voice from the adjacent darkness roared forth a warning that there was a canister of gunpowder in the fire expected every moment to explode. The prudent officers therefore kept their distance, busying themselves with noting down the names of several innocent spectators, while the bonfire subsided to a natural death, the gunpowder hoax having perfectly succeeded. Mr. Wren\u0027s guests resumed their seats, mingling with graver matters the usual badinage of a college gathering; and when at length they separated, only a lonely light or two glimmered from among the many windows of the academic barracks which overlook the college green. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78621.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
