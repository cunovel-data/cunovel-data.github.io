{"id":38098,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII.","content":"Men will woo the tempest, And wed it, to their cost.—Passion Flowers. Then fly betimes, for only they Conquer love that run away.—Carew. Morton had been for some time of opinion that he had better leave New Baden; yet still the philosophic youth staid on,—a week longer,—a fortnight longer,—and still he lingered. It would be too much to say that he was in love with his handsome, dare-devil cousin; but his mind was greatly troubled in regard to her—shaken and tossed with a variety of conflicting emotions. The multiplied and constantly changing phases of her character, its strong but utterly ungoverned resources, its frankness, enthusiasm, detestation of all deceit or pretension, and, in spite of her wildness, a deep vein of womanly tenderness which now and then betrayed itself, all conspired to keep his interest somewhat painfully excited. One evening he left the crowded piazza of the hotel, and, intending to flirt with solitude and a cigar, walked towards a rustic arbor, overgrown with a wild grape vine, and standing among a cluster of young elms at the foot of the garden. As he drew near, he saw the gleam of ladies\u0027 dresses, and found the seats already occupied by Miss Fanny Euston and two companions. Morton knew them well, and joined the party. As neither the affected graces of the one companion nor the voluble emptiness of the other had much interest in his eyes, he directed his conversation chiefly to Fanny. In a few minutes the two girls exchanged glances, rose, and alleging some pretended engagement, returned to the hotel, bent on making this casual interview assume the air of a flirtation. Morton and his companion sat for a moment in silence. \"We are cousins—are we not?\" said the former, at length. \"At least they would call us so in the Highlands.\" \"Then give me a cousin\u0027s privilege, and allow me to be personal. Are you not out of spirits to-night?\" \"Why do you think me so?\" \"From your look and manner.\" \"Are you not tired to death of New Baden?\" \"Not yet.\" \"I am. What is it all worth?—weary, and vapid, and flat, and stale, and unprofitable! I have had enough of it.\" \"Then why not change it?\" \"To find the same thing in a new shape!\" \"Pardon me if I call that a freak of the moment. You are the gayest of the gay.\" \"No, I am not.\" \"You are a belle here; a centre light. The moths flutter about you, though you do, now and then, singe their wings. You frighten them, and they repay you with fine speeches.\" \"I am weary of them. For Heaven\u0027s sake, abuse me a little. I know you have it often in your heart.\" \"Abuse is sometimes nothing but flattery in disguise.\" \"Why do you smile? That smile was at my expense.\" \"Why should you imagine so?\" \"I insist on your telling me its meaning.\" \"I was only thinking that when tribute in an old shape has become wearisome, one may like to have it paid in a new one.\" \"That certainly is not flattery. Do you know I am beginning to be afraid of you?\" \"I could not have thought you afraid of any one.\" \"Yes, I am afraid of you.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you are always observing me. Because you penetrate my thoughts and understand me thoroughly.\" \"I am less deep than you suppose.\" \"At least you know all my faults. You are always, in a quiet way, making gibes and sarcasms at my expense, and touching upon my weakest points.\" \"Does it make you angry?\" \"No; I rather like it; but I wish to repay you. I wish to find your weaknesses, but cannot. Have you any?\" \"Yes, an abundance.\" \"And will you tell me what they are?\" \"What, that you may use them against me! The moment you know them, you will attack me without mercy; and if you see me wince, it is all over with me.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that you cease to like one as soon as you find that you can gain the least advantage over him. If I could really make you a little afraid of me, you would like me all the better for it. No, I will show you none of my weaknesses; and perhaps, if I did, you would not find them of a kind that you could use against me. I can strike at you, but you cannot hurt me. I am armed in proof. I defy you.\" In saying this, at least, Morton showed some knowledge of his companion\u0027s character. To defy her successfully was a great step towards gaining her good graces; for with all her wildness she was very sensitive to the good or ill opinion of those who could compel her to respect them. She became very anxious to know what Morton thought of her. \"You say that you do not understand me thoroughly. What is there in me that you do not understand?\" \"You may say that I do not understand you at all.\" \"That is mere evasion.\" \"Who can understand the language of Babel?\" \"Do you mean that I speak the language of Babel?\" \"Who can understand chaos?\" \"And am I chaos? You are beginning your peculiar style of compliment again.\" \"Do not be displeased at it. All the power and beauty of the universe rose out of chaos.\" \"Now you are flattering in earnest.\" \"You are difficult to satisfy. What may I call you? A wild Arab racer without a rider?\" \"That will answer better.\" \"Or a rocket without a stick?\" \"I have seen rockets; but I do not know what the stick is. What is it? What is it for?\" \"To give balance and aim to the rocket—make it, as the transcendentalists say, mount skyward, and end in stars and \u0027golden rain.\u0027\" \"Very fine! And how if it has no stick?\" \"Then it sparkles, and blazes, and hisses on the ground; flies up and down, this way and that, plays the deuse with every thing and every body, and at last blows itself up to no purpose.\" \"Ah, I see that the stick is very necessary. I will try to get one.\" \"You speak in a bantering tone,\" said Morton, \"but you are in earnest.\" \"I am in earnest!\" exclaimed Fanny Euston, with a sudden change of voice and manner. \"Every word that you have spoken is true. I am driven hither and thither by feelings and impulses,—some bad, some good,—chasing every new fancy like so many butterflies or will-o\u0027-the-wisps,—without thinking of results—restless—dissatisfied—finding no life but in the excitement of the moment. Sometimes I have hints of better things. Glimpses of light break in upon me; but they come, and they go again. I have no rule of life, no guiding star.\" Morton looked at his companion not without a certain sense of victory. He saw that he had gained, for the moment at least, an influence over her, and roused her to the expression of feelings to which, perhaps, she had never given utterance before. Yet his own mind was any thing but tranquil. Something more than admiration was stirring within him. He felt impelled to explore farther the proud spirit which had already yielded up to him some of its secrets. But he felt that, with her eyes upon him, he could not speak without committing himself farther than he was prepared to do. In this dilemma he determined to retreat—a resolution for which he was entitled to no little credit, if its merit is to be measured by the effort it cost him. He rose from his seat. \"Find your star, Fanny, and you may challenge the world. But I see people coming down the garden towards us. We shall be invaded if we stay here. Let us walk back towards the house.\" When he found himself alone again, he paced his room in no very enviable frame of mind. \"What devil impelled me to speak as I did? It was no part of mine to be telling her of her faults. Am I turning philanthropist and busybody? If I wished to gain her heart, I suspect I have been taking the right course. What with any other lady would have been intolerable presumption and arrogance, is the most effectual way to win her esteem. And why should I not wish to gain her heart? There is good there in abundance, if one could but depend on it. No; I am not blinded yet. This last outburst was a momentary impulse, like all the rest; and to-morrow she will be reckless as ever. She delights in lawlessness, and rejoices in the zest of breaking established bounds. Her wayward will is like a cataract, and may carry her, God knows whither. No; I will not walk in this path; I will not try to marry her. Her heart is untouched—that is clear as the day. I wish she could say as much of mine. I will leave this place to-morrow, cost what it will.\" A letter from Boston gave him a pretext; and bidding farewell to his cousin and her mother, he took the early train homewards. The newsboy brought him a paper, and his eyes rested on the columns; but his thoughts centred on Fanny Euston and his last evening\u0027s conversation with her at the foot of the garden.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78629.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
