{"id":38097,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII.","content":"Will you woo this wildcat?—Katharine and Petruchio. Meredith went away, as he had proposed, leaving Morton at New Baden. The latter soon came to the opinion that he had never yet found so interesting a subject of psychological observation as that afforded him in the person of his relative, Miss Euston. She seemed to him the most wayward of mortals; yet in the midst of this lawlessness, generous instincts were constantly betraying themselves, and a certain native grace, a charm of womanhood, followed her wildest caprices. She often gave great offence by her brusqueries; yet those who best knew her were commonly her ardent friends. Mrs. Primrose looked upon her with her most profound and unqualified disapprobation. Her daughter copied her sentiments; while Stubb thought her an outside barbarian of the most alarming character. Fanny Euston\u0027s perceptions were very acute. She saw the effect she had produced, and seemed to take peculiar delight in aggravating it, and shocking the prejudices of her critics still more. One afternoon, Miss Primrose, Mr. Stubb, Fanny Euston, Morton, and several others, set out on a horseback excursion, matronized by Mrs. Primrose. At a few miles from New Baden, Morton found himself riding at his cousin\u0027s side, a little behind the rest. \"Do you know, I came this morning, to ask you to join us on our walk to Elk Ridge.\" \"Ah, I am sorry I was not there.\" \"You were there; but you seemed so deep in Ivanhoe, or some other of your favorites, that I had no heart to interrupt you.\" \"But that was quite absurd. I should like to have gone.\" \"I am curious to know what book you were so busy with. Something of Scott\u0027s—was it not?\" \"Not precisely.\" \"Nor one of the new novels,\" pursued Morton—\"those are not after your taste.\" \"Not at all; they are all full of some grand reform or philanthropic scheme, or the sorrows of some destitute, uninteresting little wretch, with whom you are required to sympathize.\" \"You are not moulded after the philanthropic model. But may I ask, what book was entertaining you so much?\" \"Napier\u0027s Life of Montrose.\" \"And do you like it?\" \"Indeed I do.\" \"And you like Montrose?\" \"Certainly I like him.\" \"I could have sworn it. Do you remember his verses to the lady of his heart?\" \"That I do,\" said Fanny Euston,— \"\u0027Like Alexander I will reign, And I will reign alone; My heart shall evermore disdain A rival on my throne. He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, Who puts it not unto the touch, To win or lose it all. \"\u0027But if thou wilt be constant then, And faithful of thy word, I\u0027ll make thee famous by my pen, And glorious by my sword; I\u0027ll serve thee in such noble ways Was never heard before; I\u0027ll dress and crown thee all with bays, And love thee evermore.\u0027\" \"Admirable! I thought I had a good memory, but you beat me hollow. You repeat the lines as if you liked them.\" \"Who would not like them?\" \"And yet his fashion of wooing would be a little peremptory for the nineteenth century.\" \"There are no Montroses in the nineteenth century.\" \"They are out of date, like many a good thing besides. Not long ago, I saw some verses in a magazine—a kind of ballad on Montrose\u0027s execution.\" \"Can you repeat it?\" \"I cannot compete with you; but I think I can give you a stanza or two:— \"\u0027The morning dawned full darkly, The rain came flashing down, And the jagged streak of the levin bolt Lit up the gloomy town: The thunder crashed across the heaven, The fatal hour was come; And ay broke in, with muffled beat, The \u0027larum of the drum. There was madness on the earth below, And anger in the sky, And young and old, and rich and poor, Came forth to see him die. \"\u0027But when he came, though pale and wan, He looked so great and high, So noble was his manly front, So calm his steadfast eye,— The rabble rout forbore to shout, And each man held his breath, For well they knew the hero\u0027s soul Was face to face with death.\u0027\" Fanny Euston\u0027s eye kindled, as if at a strain of warlike music. \"Go on.\" \"I have forgotten the rest.\" \"Then pray find the verses and send them to me. Why is it that, as you say, such men are out of date?\" \"What place, or what career, could they find in a commercial country?\" \"Then why were we born in a commercial country?\" \"You seem to make an ideal hero of Montrose.\" \"Not I. I am not the school girl you take me for. I have no ideal hero. I do not believe in ideal heroes. Montrose was a man, with the faults of a man; full of faults, and yet not a bad man either.\" \"Very far from it.\" \"He had great faults, but grand qualities to match them,—worth a thousand of the small, tame, correct virtues that one sees hereabouts.\" \"Dangerous ideas, those, Mrs. Primrose would tell you.\" \"Deliver me from Mrs. Primrose!\" ejaculated Fanny. They rode in silence for a few minutes, Morton\u0027s companion murmuring to herself fragments of the lines which he had just repeated. \"Look!\" she cried, suddenly. \"How slowly our horses have been walking! The rest are almost out of sight. We had better join them. Will you race with me?\" \"Any thing you please.\" \"Come on, then.\" She touched her horse with the whip, and they set forward at full speed. Fanny, who was by far the better mounted, soon gained the day. \"Rein up,\" cried Morton, as they came near the party, \"or your horse will startle the others.\" Fanny drew the curb, but not quite successfully; and her rapid arrival produced some commotion. Stubb\u0027s horse, in particular, began to prance and curvet in a manner which greatly disturbed his rider\u0027s equanimity. \"Whoa! Whoa, boy!\" said Stubb. \"Steady, now! steady, sir! Whoa!\" Fanny\u0027s eyes twinkled with malicious delight. She had a great contempt for Stubb, who, on his part, was mortally afraid of her. \"That\u0027s a good horse of yours,\" pushing close to his side. \"Yes, a very fine horse, indeed. Steady, boy! Steady, now!\" \"A capital horse; but he needs a spirited hand like yours to manage him.\" \"Whoa! Quiet, now!—poor fellow!\" This last endearing address was checked by a sudden jolt, produced by a spasmodic movement of the horse, which shook the cavalier to his very centre. \"Punish him well with your spurs, Mr. Stubb, and let him run; that\u0027s the way to cure him of his tricks. Suppose we try a race together.\" \"Thank you, Miss Euston, but the fact is— Whoa, boy! whoa!— I mean, the stableman told me that he is rather short of breath.\" \"O, never mind the stableman. Come, let\u0027s go.\" \"Thank you, Miss Euston, I believe not to-day.\" \"You astonish me. I will lay any bet you like—you shall name the wager—any thing you please.\" \"Really, this is a little too bad!\" soliloquized the horrified Mrs. Primrose. \"Miss Euston, I entreat of you—I beg—that we may have no more racing. It is very dangerous, besides being——\" \"What is it besides being dangerous, Mrs. Primrose?\" \"Very indecorous.\" \"I am very sorry, for I have set my heart on a race with Mr. Stubb.\" \"Mr. Morton,\" said the distressed lady, aside to that young gentleman, \"you are a prudent and sober-minded person; pray use your influence.\" She was interrupted by a most uncanonical ejaculation from the author of her embarrassments, which, though couched in a foreign language, petrified her into silence. A sharp gust of wind had blown away Fanny\u0027s veil, and she was on the point of dashing off in pursuit of it. \"Stop!\" cried Morton, \"you\u0027ll break your neck. Let me get it for you.\" The veil sailed away before the wind, and Morton spurred in pursuit, delighted to display his horsemanship before ladies, though it had no other merit than a tenacious seat and a kind of recklessness, the result of an excitable temperament. The ground was rough and broken, and studded with rocks and savin bushes, and as he galloped at a breakneck speed down the side of the hill, in a vain attempt to catch the veil flying, even Fanny held her breath. He secured his prize, as it caught against a bush, and returned to the road. \"Now, Miss Euston,\" said Mrs. Primrose, looking folios at the offender, \"I trust we shall be allowed to go on in peace.\" There was an interval of repose. Stubb regained his peace of mind. Miss Primrose, with whom he fancied himself in love, smiled upon him, and his self-conceit, before shaken in its stronghold, was returning in full force, when Fanny, who nourished a peculiar spite against this harmless blockhead, and whom that afternoon a very Satan of mischief seemed to possess, again rode to his side, and renewed her solicitations for a race. \"Miss Euston,\" said Mrs. Primrose, \"I am certain you would do nothing so unladylike as to force Mr. Stubb to race against his will. Consider the example you would set to Georgiana Gosling, who always imitates what she sees you do.\" The words were mild and motherly; but the countenance of the outraged matron had an uncompromising look of reprehension, which exasperated Fanny\u0027s wayward humor beyond measure. She began, it is true, a lively conversation on general topics with the intelligent Stubb, but, meantime, by alternately checking and exciting her horse, and urging him to play a variety of antics, she contrived to infect her companion\u0027s steed with the like contagion. He pranced, plunged, and chafed, till his rider was brought to the verge of despair. The road had become quite narrow, running through a thick forest, frequented chiefly by woodcutters in the winter, and hunters of the picturesque in summer. Fanny\u0027s imitator, the adventurous Miss Gosling, a little girl of fourteen, had ridden a few rods in advance of the rest, when suddenly they saw her returning, astonished and disconsolate. \"We can\u0027t go any farther; there\u0027s a great tree fallen across the road.\" A severe thundergust of the night before had overthrown a hemlock, the trunk of which, partly sustained by the roots and branches, formed a barrier about four feet from the ground. It was impossible to pass through the woods on either side, as they were very dense, and choked with a tangled growth of laurel bushes. \"How very annoying!\" said Miss Primrose. \"What shall we do?\" inquired Miss Gosling. \"Why, jump over it, to be sure,\" said Fanny. \"Mr. Stubb and I will show you the way.\" \"You are surely not in earnest!\" cried Mrs. Primrose. \"Of course I am. I have taken higher leaps at the riding school, twenty times.\" \"You had better not,\" said Morton, who had alighted by the roadside to draw his saddle girth. \"It is too dangerous to be thought of for a single moment,\" added Mrs. Primrose. \"Our horses,\" pursued the indiscreet Stubb, \"are not used to leaping, and some of the ladies would certainly be hurt.\" \"The fool!\" thought Morton. \"He has done it now.\" Fanny threw a laughing, caustic glance at her victim. \"Mine will leap, I know; and you are not a lady. Come, Mr. Stubb.\" \"Miss Euston,\" interposed the excited Mrs. Primrose, \"this must not be. I am here in your mother\u0027s place, and she will hold me responsible for your safety. I forbid you to go, Miss Euston.\" Fanny looked for a moment in her face. Morton caught the expression. It was one of unqualified, though not ill-natured, defiance. \"Come,\" cried Fanny again, and ran her horse towards the tree. She leaped gallantly, and cleared the barrier; but it was evident that she had lost control of the spirited animal, who galloped at a furious rate down the road. Morton was still on foot, busied with his saddle girth. \"The crazy child!\" exclaimed Mrs. Primrose; \"her horse is running away. Go after her—pray!—Mr. Stubb—somebody.\" \"O, quick! quick!—do,\" cried little Miss Gosling, who idolized Fanny, and was in an agony of fright for her. Thus exhorted, the desperate Stubb cried, \"Get up,\" and galloped for the tree; but his horse balked, and, leaping aside, tumbled him into the mud. The ladies screamed. Morton would have laughed, if he had not been too anxious for Fanny. \"Get out of the way, Stubb,\" he cried, mounting with all despatch. Miss Primrose\u0027s admirer gathered himself up, regained his hat, which had taken refuge in a puddle, and looked with horror at a ghastly white rent across his knee. Morton spurred his hack against the barrier, which the beast cleared with difficulty, striking his hind hoofs as he went over. After riding a short distance, he discovered Fanny, and saw, to his great relief, that she was regaining control over her horse. Half a mile farther on, the road divided. The larger branch led to the right, Morton did not know whither; the smaller turned to the left, and after circling through the woods for two or three miles, issued upon the high road. Fanny, who was ignorant of the way, took the right hand branch. In a few minutes after, she had brought her horse to a trot, and Morton rode up to her side. \"You are wiser than I am, if you know where we are going.\" \"I thought you knew the way. You were to have been our guide.\" \"We are on the wrong road. You should have turned to the left.\" \"But have you no idea where this will lead us?\" \"Into a cedar swamp, for what I know. Had we not better turn back?\" \"O, don\u0027t speak of turning back. I am in no mood for turning back. Let us keep on. I am sure this will bring us out somewhere.\" \"As you please,\" said Morton, knowing himself to be in the position of an angler, whose only chance of managing his salmon is to give it line. \"Where are all the rest?\" \"Holding a convention behind the tree, I suppose. At least, I left them there.\" \"And did not Mr. Stubb dare the fatal leap?\" \"He tried, and was thrown into a mud puddle.\" \"No bodily harm, I hope.\" \"No; beaver and broadcloth were the principal sufferers. But his conceit is shaken out of him for twenty-four hours, at least.\" \"Then I have wrought a miracle, and can claim to be canonized on the strength of it.\" \"I hope you may be; but I never expected to see your name in the calendar of saints.\" \"As you will not allow me to be a saint, I suppose you consider me as mad. Sanctity and madness, they say, are of kin.\" \"A hair\u0027s breadth, or so, on this side madness.\" \"Then I am entitled to great credit for keeping my wits at all. What reasonable girl would not be driven mad with Mrs. Primrose to watch her, and disapprove of her, and correct her? Strange—is it not?—that some people—if Mrs. Primrose will allow me to use so inelegant an expression—are always rubbing one against the grain.\" \"To give you your due, I think you have paid off handsomely any grudge you may owe in that quarter.\" \"There is consolation in that. Tell me—you are of the out-spoken sort—are you not of my opinion? Let me know your mind. Mr. Stubb is——\" \"A puppy.\" \"And the Primroses are——\" \"Uninteresting.\" \"For uninteresting, say insufferable. If Lucifer wishes to gain me over to his side, let Mrs. Primrose be made my guardian angel, and his work is done.\" \"Your horse has cast a shoe,\" said Morton, abruptly,—\"yes; and he is lame besides.\" \"It is this broken, stony road. I wish we were at the end of it.\" \"So do I. If the clouds would break for a moment, and show us the sun, I could form some idea of the direction we are following.\" \"Why,\" said Fanny, in alarm, looking at her watch, \"the sun must be very near setting.\" Morton began to be very anxious, for his companion\u0027s sake, when, a moment after, they came upon a broader track, which intersected the other, and seemed a main thoroughfare of the woodcutters. \"This looks more promising,\" said Morton; and turning to the left, they pushed their horses to their best pace. Twilight came on, and it was quite dark when they emerged at length upon the broad and dusty highway. In a few minutes they saw a countryman, with his hands in his pockets, and a long nine between his lips, lounging by the roadside. \"How far is it to New Baden?\" \"Wal,\" replied the man, after studying his querist in silence for about half a minute, \"it\u0027s fifteen mile strong.\" Morton looked at Fanny, whose horse was very lame, and who, in spite of her spirit, began to show unmistakable signs of fatigue. \"Is there a public house any where near?\" \"Yas; it ain\u0027t far ahead to Mashum\u0027s.\" \"How far?\" \"Rather better nor a mile.\" On coming to the inn, Morton commended Fanny to the care of the landlady, an honest New Hampshire woman, remounted without delay, and urged his tired horse to such speed that he reached the hotel before half past nine. His arrival relieved the anxieties, or silenced the tattle of the inmates; and in the morning Fanny\u0027s uncle drove to the inn, and brought back the adventurous damsel to New Baden. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78628.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
