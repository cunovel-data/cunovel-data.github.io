{"id":38112,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII.","content":"Ham. Thou wouldst not think how ill\u0027s all here about my heart, but it is no matter. Hor. Nay, good my lord—— Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman. Hor. If your mind dislike any thing, obey it. Ham. Not a whit. We defy augury. Morton\u0027s day of departure came. It was a comfortless, savage, gusty morning, an east wind blowing in from the bay. The hour to set sail was near; he should have been on board; but still he lingered with Edith Leslie. The secrecy on which her father insisted made it impossible for her to go with him to the ship. Morton forced himself away; his hand was on the door, but his heart failed him, and he turned back again. On the mind of each there was something more than the pain of a year\u0027s separation. A dark foreboding, a cloud of dull and sullen portent, hung over them both. The smooth and bright crusting with which habit and training had iced over the warm nature of Edith Leslie was broken and swept away; and as Morton seized her hands, she disengaged herself, and, throwing herself on his neck, sobbed convulsively. Morton pressed her to his heart, and buried his face in her clustering tresses; then, breaking from her, ran blindly from the house. He repaired to the house of Meredith, who met him at the door. \"You\u0027ve no time to lose. Here\u0027s the carriage. Your trunks are all right. Come on.\" They drove towards the wharf. \"I\u0027d give my head to change places with you,\" said Meredith. \"I wish you could.\" There was so much pain and dejection in his look, that his friend could not fail to observe it. \"You don\u0027t want to go, then? I have noticed all along that you seemed devilish cool about it.\" \"Ned,\" said Morton, \"I never used to think myself superstitious; but I begin now to change my mind. Heaven knows why, but I have strange notions running in my brain. My dog howled all last night; and not long ago, an owl yelled over my head, and that, too, at a time—— But you\u0027ll think I have lost my wits.\" Meredith, in truth, was greatly amazed at this betrayal of a weakness of which, long and closely as he had known his companion, he had never suspected him. \"Why, colonel, I have seen you set out on a journey as long and fifty times as hazardous as this, as carelessly as if you were going to a dinner party.\" \"I know it; but times are changed with me. I am not quite the child, though, that you may suppose.\" \"If you have such a feeling about going, I would give it up. It\u0027s not too late.\" \"No, I haven\u0027t sunk yet to that pass.\" And, as he spoke, the carriage stopped at the pier. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78643.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
