That day Vinal drove to the Quartier Latin, called upon his friend Richards, and asked him to dine at the Trois Frères Proven?aux. Mr. Richards was never known to decline such an invitation. To the Trois Frères accordingly they repaired. Richards, whose social position at home was much inferior to that of his entertainer, thought the latter a capital fellow; especially when Vinal flattered him by deferring to his better taste and experience in the ordering of the dinner. But when, after nightfall, they issued forth again upon the open area of the Palais Royal, the delicate Vinal shivered with the cold. A chill wind and a dreary rain had set in, and Vinal, always cautious in such matters, said that before proceeding on their evening\u0027s amusements, he would go to Meurice\u0027s and get an overcoat. The overcoat being found, Vinal, buttoned to the chin, came down the stairway, and rejoined Richards. Morton had just before sent a servant for a carriage, to drive to the opera, and was waiting wrapped in his cloak, on the steps outside the door. \"What shall our first move be?\" asked Richards of Vinal, as they passed out. \"Whatever you like.\" \"You had better give the word.\" \"Then suppose we go and see your friend, the professor.\" \"Who the deuse is Richards\u0027s friend, the professor?\" thought Morton, as the others passed without observing him. \"The professor\" was a cant term for Mr. Henry Speyer. Speyer lived in an obscure part of the Latin quarter; and Richards, who was vain of his intimacy with this scoundrel, as indicating how deeply he was versed in Paris life, approached his lodging with much circumspection, by dim and devious routes. \"My name is Wilton, and I hail from New Orleans,\" said Vinal, as they reached the patriot\u0027s threshold. As Mr. Wilton, of New Orleans, then, Vinal became known to Mr. Henry Speyer. The latter\u0027s quarters were any thing but commodious or attractive; and Richards invited him to a petit souper at his own lodgings, which were not very remote. Leaving Speyer to make his own way thither, he proceeded to summon two additional guests, in the persons of two friends of his own, his favorite partners at the Chaumière. With the aid of wine and cigars, the party became, in time, very animated. Vinal, who had a quick and pungent wit, drew upon himself much applause, and Speyer regarded him with especial commendation. But while he played his part thus successfully, he was studying his companions, as a scholar studies a book; studiously keeping himself cool; sipping a few drops of his wine, and slyly spilling the rest under the table, while he did his best to stimulate the others, and especially Speyer, to drink. Speyer drank, indeed, but the wine seemed to produce no more effect on him than water. He remained as cool as Vinal himself. The latter, young as he was, was a close and penetrating judge of men; and when, at two o\u0027clock in the morning, he returned to his hotel, he carried with him the conviction that, in his present beggared condition, a few hundred francs would bribe the patriot to commit any moderately safe villany. The evening, however, had had one result which Vinal regretted. Mr. Richards, being obfuscated with champagne, had repeatedly called him by his true name; so that Speyer was fully aware that his new acquaintance was not Mr. Wilton, of New Orleans, but Mr. Horace Vinal, of Boston. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78647.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
