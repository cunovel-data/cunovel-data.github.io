{"id":38117,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII.","content":"And, far the blackest there, the traitor friend.—Dryden. Several days had passed, during which Vinal contrived to have more than one private interview with his new acquaintance, Speyer. He had sounded him with much astuteness; found that he could serve him; and was confirmed in his assurance that he would. Morton, he knew, was to leave Paris on the next morning. The time to act was now, or never. At about three in the afternoon, he discovered his rival sauntering along an avenue in the garden of the Tuileries; and walking up behind, he joined him. \"There are some of us,\" said Vinal, after a few moments\u0027 conversation, \"going to Versailles to-morrow. Will you go?\" \"I mean to leave Paris to-morrow.\" \"To-morrow! That\u0027s very sudden.\" \"I shall come back again in a few months.\" \"Your first move is to Italy, I think you said.\" \"No, to Austria and the Danube.\" \"O, I remember; it is West who is going to Italy. I think he has chosen the better route of the two.\" \"Yes, as far as history and works of art are concerned. But the Austrian provinces are the best field for me. I am mounted on a hobby, you know, and my time is so short that I must make the most of what I have.\" \"You wish to see the people—the different races—is that it?\" \"Yes.\" \"You ought to be well booked up before you go, or you\u0027ll lose time. By the way, I made an acquaintance a little while ago in the diligence from Strasburg—a very agreeable man, a professor at Berlin——\" \"O, the professor whom you and Richards were going to see, the other night.\" A thrill shot through Vinal\u0027s nerves; but the unsuspecting Morton almost instantly relieved his terror. \"I was standing on the steps as you went out, and heard you say that you were going to visit him. From the way in which you spoke, I imagined him to be some professor of the noble art of self-defence.\" \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Vinal, not quite recovered from his surprise; \"no, not precisely that; Speyer is a philologist—that\u0027s his department.\" \"And Richards knows him, too?\" \"Yes, through my introduction.\" \"From your calling him \u0027his friend, the professor,\u0027 I imagined that the acquaintance began the other way.\" \"Yes, his friend, with a vengeance. Confound the fellow, as I was walking with him the other day, we met Speyer, and I, thinking no harm, introduced them; but it wasn\u0027t twenty-four hours before Richards was at him to borrow money, which Speyer let him have. I dare say Richards has bled you as well.\" \"No.\" \"No? Then you are luckier than I am. I advise you to keep out of his way, or he\u0027ll pin you before you know it.\" \"I should judge as much.\" \"I spoke of Professor Speyer because he was born in some outlandish corner of the Austrian empire,—Croatia, I think he told me,—and had his head full of political soap bubbles founded on the distribution of races in that part of the world. He put me to sleep half a dozen times with talking about Pansclavism and the manifest destinies of the Sclavic peoples. He is the very man for you; and I am sorry I didn\u0027t think of it before.\" \"Well,\" said Morton, \"I must blunder through as I can.\" \"Are you at leisure? I\u0027ll go with you this afternoon, if you like, and call on him.\" \"I dare say my visit would bore him.\" \"Get him upon the races in the Austrian empire, and he will be more apt to bore you. Are you free at four o\u0027clock?\" pursued Vinal, looking at his watch. \"Yes, quite so.\" \"Very well. I\u0027m going now to my tailor\u0027s. Every genuine American, you know, must have a new fit-out in Paris. I\u0027ll meet you at Meurice\u0027s at four, and we\u0027ll go from there to Speyer\u0027s.\" Vinal had three quarters of an hour to spare. He spent a part of them in forging the next link of his chain. At four he rejoined Morton, and they walked out together. \"I think you\u0027ll like Professor Speyer,\" said Vinal. \"I have become quite intimate with him, on the strength of a fortnight\u0027s acquaintance. He urges me to go to Hungary and Transylvania, and offered me introductions to his friends there. It would not be a bad plan for you to ask him for letters. They would not make you acquainted with the Austrian haut ton, but they would bring you into contact with men of his own stamp,—people of knowledge and intelligence, who could be of great service to you, and with whom you needn\u0027t be on terms of much ceremony.—Here\u0027s the place;—he lives here.\" It was a lodging house on the Rue Rivoli. Vinal rang the bell. The porter appeared. \"Is Professor Speyer at home?\" \"Non, monsieur; il est sorti.\" Vinal had just bribed the man to give this answer. \"That\u0027s unlucky,\" he said. \"Well, if you like, we can come again this evening.\" \"I am engaged to dine this evening at Madame ——\u0027s.\" Vinal had known of this engagement. \"I don\u0027t see, then, but that you will lose your chance with Speyer. Well, fortune de guerre. I should like to have had you see him, though.\" And they walked towards the Boulevards, conversing on indifferent matters. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78648.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
