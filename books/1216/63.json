Morton walked the street, on the next day, in a mood less grave than had lately been his wont, but in one of any thing but self-approval. \"It is singular,\" he thought, \"I could never meet her without forgetting myself,—without being betrayed into some absurdity or other. I thought by this time that I had grown wiser, or, at least, was well fenced against that kind of risk. But it is the same now as ever. I was a fool at New Baden, and I was a fool again last night, though after a different fashion. After all, when a fresh breeze comes, why should I not breathe it? when a ray of sun comes, why should I not bask in it? But what impelled me to insult that wretch, who I knew dared not and could not answer me?\" He pondered for a moment, then turned and walked slowly towards Vinal\u0027s place of business. \"Is Mr. Vinal here?\" he asked of one of the clerks. \"Yes, sir, he is in that inner room.\" \"Is any one with him?\" \"No, sir.\" And Morton opened the door and entered. Vinal sat before a table, on which letters and papers were lying; but he was leaning backward in his chair, with a painfully knit brow, and a face of ghastly paleness. It flushed of a sudden as Morton appeared, and his whole look and mien showed an irrepressible agitation. Morton closed the door. \"Vinal,\" he said, \"you need not fear that I have come with any hostile purpose. On the contrary, I will serve you, if I can. Last night I used words to you which I have since regretted. I beg you to accept my apology.\" Vinal made no reply. \"I saw Speyer in the street last evening, and tried to speak with him, but could not stop him. He can hardly have any other purpose in breaking his oath and coming here again, than to get more money from you. Has he been to you?\" Still Vinal was silent. \"I think,\" continued Morton, \"that you cannot fail to see my motive. I wish to keep him from you, not on your account, but on your wife\u0027s. If you let him, he will torment you to your death. Have you seen him since last evening?\" Vinal inclined his head. \"Where is he now?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Has he left the city?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I suppose so.\" \"And you gave him money?\" Vinal was silent again. Morton took his silence for assent. \"When he comes again, tell me of it, and let me speak to him. Possibly I may find means to rid you of him. Meantime remember this. He has given your letter up to me. He has no proofs to show against you, unless he has other letters of yours;—is that the case?\" Vinal shook his head. \"Then, if he proclaims you, his word will not be taken, unless I sustain it; and I shall keep silent unless you give me some new cause to speak. I do not see that he can harm you much without my help; so give him no more money, and set him at defiance.\" Morton left the room; but his words had brought no relief to the wretched Vinal. Speyer had shown him his letter, and told him the artifice by which he had kept it, and palmed off a counterfeit on Morton. He felt himself at the mercy of a miscreant as rapacious, fierce, and pitiless, as a wolverene dropping on its prey.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78679.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
