{"id":38111,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI.","content":"Then loathed he in his native land to dwell.—Childe Harold. Slend. A gentleman born, Master Parson, who writes himself Armigero; in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, Armigero! Shal. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.—Merry Wives of Windsor. The engagement of Miss Leslie and Morton was to be kept secret till the latter\u0027s return. None knew it but Leslie and Vinal. Vinal, within a few weeks, sailed for Europe, meaning, however, to be absent only three or four months. Other motives apart, he felt, and Leslie saw, that his health, always shivering in the wind, demanded the change. Meanwhile, Morton made the best of a six weeks\u0027 reprieve; and hampered as he was by the injunction of secrecy, and the precautions which it demanded, he crowded the short interval with half a lifetime of mixed pleasure and pain, expectation and anxiety. It was past but too quickly; in three days more he must set sail. Walking the street in a rueful mood, he met his classmate, Chester, who, having made the tour of Europe, had lost his obsolete ways, and grown backward into a man of the present world. \"Good morning, Morton. Making calls?—I see it by your face.\" \"Yes; it\u0027s a thing that must be done sometimes.\" \"Pour prendre congé, I suppose. I hear you are off very soon.\" \"The day after to-morrow.\" \"You couldn\u0027t do a wiser thing. When a man finds himself in a scrape, he had better get out of it as soon as possible; therefore, if he finds himself born in America, he had better forswear his country.\" \"Patriotic sentiments those.\" \"I can\u0027t answer for the patriotism; but they are the sentiments of a true son of the Pilgrim Fathers, who renounced their country because they couldn\u0027t stand it, and came over here. I mean to follow their example, and go back again. They fled—so the story goes—from persecution. I mean to fly from persecution too,—the persecution of a social atmosphere that I find hostile to my constitution, and a climate not fit for a reasonable being to live in.\" \"I don\u0027t know why you should be so fierce against the climate. By your look, you seem to thrive in it.\" \"The bodily man thrives passably well. It\u0027s the immortal part that suffers. Fierce! why, the climate makes me fierce. Who can be a philosopher in such a climate?—or a poet?—or an artist?—any thing but a steam engine? It is a perpetual spur, an unremitting goad. Nobody is happy in it except the men who ride on locomotives and conduct express trains,—always on the move. O, so you go in here, do you?\" \"Yes, to see Mrs. Primrose. Will you come too?\" \"No, thank you,\" replied Chester, walking away, with a comical look. Morton rang the door bell, and found Mrs. Primrose at home. There was a book on the table. He took it up. It was a novel, lately published. Morton praised it. Mrs. Primrose dissented, with great emphasis. \"You are severe upon the book.\" \"Not more so than it deserves,\" replied Mrs. Primrose; \"it is too coarse to be permitted for a moment.\" \"And yet the moral tone seems good enough.\" \"I do not blame the morality so much as the bad taste. It is full of slang dialogue, and was certainly written by a very unrefined person.\" \"It makes its characters speak as such people speak in real life.\" \"It is not merely that,\" said Mrs. Primrose, slightly pursing her mouth; \"it contains, besides, expressions absolutely reprehensible.\" \"One does not admire its good taste; but a little blunt Saxon never did much harm.\" \"No daughter of mine shall read it,\" said Mrs. Primrose, with gravity. \"I imagine that if literature is to reflect human life truly, it can hardly be limited to the language of the drawing room.\" \"Then it should be banished from the drawing room,\" said Mrs. Primrose, with severity. Here several visitors appeared, and Morton presently took leave. He was but a few rods from the door, when a quick step came behind him. \"Hallo, colonel, where are you going at such a rate?\" Morton turned, and saw his classmate, Rosny. \"Why, Dick, I\u0027m glad to see you.\" \"They tell me you\u0027re bound for Europe.\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, it\u0027s a good move. If a man has money, he had better enjoy it.\" \"I shall be driving out of town in an hour. Come and dine with me.\" \"Sorry, colonel, but it can\u0027t be done. I\u0027m out on the stump in the cause of democracy. Shall be off westward in two hours, and shake the dust from my shoes against this nest of whiggery and old fogyism.\" \"Democracy is under the weather just now, Dick.\" \"Just now, I grant you. What with log cabins and hard cider, and coons, the enlightened people are pretty well gammoned. But there\u0027s a good time coming. Before you know it, democracy will be upon you again like a load of bricks. Why, what can you expect of a party that will take a coon for its emblem? I saw one chained up this morning in the yard of Taft\u0027s tavern, a dirty, mean-looking beast, about half way between a jackal and an owl. He looked uncommonly well in health, and could puff out his fur as round as a muff. But, when you looked close, there was nothing of him but skin and bone; exactly like the whig party. He put up his nose, and smiled at me. I suppose—damn his impudence—he took me for a whig. That coon is going into a decline. It won\u0027t be long before he is taken by the tail and tossed over Charles River bridge; and there he\u0027ll lie on the mud at low tide, for a genuine emblem of the defunct whig party, and a solemn warning to all coon worshippers.\" \"Let the whigs alone, Dick; and if you won\u0027t dine with me, come in here and drink a glass of claret.\" \"That I\u0027ll do.\" And they went into the hotel accordingly. As Rosny took up his glass, Morton observed a large old seal ring on his finger. \"Do you call yourself a democrat, and yet always wear that ring of yours?\" \"Why, what\u0027s the matter with the ring?\" \"Nothing, except that it is a badge of feudalism, aristocracy, and every thing else abominable to your party.\" \"Pshaw, man. Look here: do you see that crest, cut in the stone? That crest followed King Francis to Pavia, and when Henri Quatre charged at Ivry, it wasn\u0027t far behind him. It is mine by right. It comes down to me, straight as a bee line, through twenty generations. And do you think I\u0027m going to renounce my birthright? No, be gad!\" \"I wouldn\u0027t. But what becomes of your democracy?\" \"Democracy is tall enough to take care of itself. I wear that ring; but it don\u0027t follow that I stand on my ancestry. You needn\u0027t laugh: the case is just this. If the blood in my veins makes me stand to my colors where another man would flinch, or hold my head up where another would be sprawling on his back; if it gives me a better pluck, grit, go-ahead; why, that\u0027s what I stand on,—that\u0027s my patent of nobility. What the deuse are you laughing at?—the personal quality,—don\u0027t you see?—and not the ancestry.\" \"If you stand on personal merit, you\u0027ll be sure to go under before long. The democracy are growing as jealous of that as of ancestry, or of wealth either.\" \"Why, what do you know about politics? You never had any thing to do with them. You are no more fit for a politician than for a fiddler.\" \"I\u0027m glad you think so. If I must serve the country in any public capacity, I pray Heaven it may be as a scavenger sooner than as a politician. Who can touch pitch and be clean? I\u0027ll pay back your compliment, Dick. You are a great deal too downright to succeed in public life.\" \"I\u0027ll find a way or make one. But I tell you, colonel,\"—and a shade of something like disappointment passed over his face,—\"if a man wants the people\u0027s votes, it\u0027s fifty to one that he\u0027s got to sink himself lower than the gutter before he gets them.\" \"Yes, and when the people have turned out of office every man of virtue, honor, manliness, independence, and ability, then they will fling up their caps and brag that their day is come, and their triumph finished over the damned aristocracy.\" \"You are an unbeliever. You haven\u0027t half faith enough in the people. Now I put it to your common sense. Isn\u0027t there a thousand times more patriotism in the laboring classes in this country—yes, and about as much intelligence—as in the rabble of sham fashionables at Saratoga, or any other muster of our moneyed snobs and flunkeys?\" \"Exceptions excepted, yes.\" \"War to the knife with the codfish aristocracy! They are a kind of mongrel beast, expressly devised and concocted for me to kick. I don\u0027t mean the gentlemen with money; nor the good fellows with money. I know what a gentleman is; yes, and a lady, too, though I do make stump speeches, and shake hands all round with the sovereign people. That sort are welcome to their money. No, sir, it\u0027s the moneyed snobs, the gilded toadstools, that it\u0027s my mission to pitch into.\" \"Excuse me a moment, Dick,\" said Morton, suddenly leaping from his seat, as a lady passed the window. \"A lady, eh! Then I\u0027ll be off.\" \"No, no, stay where you are. I\u0027ll be back again in three minutes.\" He ran out of the hotel, and walked at his best pace in pursuit of Fanny Euston, who, on her part, was walking with an earnest air, like one whose thoughts were engaged with some engrossing subject. He reached her side, and made a movement to accost her; but she seemed unconscious of his presence. \"Miss Fanny Euston, will you pardon me for breaking in upon your reveries?\" She turned and recognized him, but her smile of recognition was a very mournful one. \"I have stopped you to take my leave,—a good deal more in short hand than I meant it should have been. I shall sail for Europe the day after to-morrow.\" \"Yes? Is not that a little sudden?\" \"More sudden than I wish it were. I am not at all in a travelling humor. I have been too much pressed for time to ride out, as I meant to do, to your father\u0027s house.\" \"We are all in town now. My father came from New Orleans yesterday, very ill.\" \"I did not hear of it. I trust not dangerously ill.\" \"He is dying. He cannot live a week.\" Morton well knew the strength and depth of her attachment to her father. He pressed her hand in silent sympathy. \"It grieves me, Fanny,\" he said, after a moment, \"to part from you under such a cloud.\" \"Good by,\" she replied, returning the friendly pressure. \"I wish you with all my heart a pleasant and prosperous journey.\" Morton turned back, wondering at the sudden dignity of manner which grief had given to the wild and lawless Fanny Euston. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78642.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
