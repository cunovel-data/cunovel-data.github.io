{"id":38143,"no":58,"title":"CHAPTER LVIII.","content":"When rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.—Much Ado about Nothing. Morton reached New York, and found the person to whom he had been referred by Richards. He proved to be a German, of respectable appearance enough; but Morton could learn nothing from him. He admitted that he had once known Speyer; but stubbornly denied all present knowledge concerning him; and after various inquiry elsewhere, which brought him into contact with much vile company, without helping him towards his end, Morton gave over the search, and returned to Boston. A day or two after, he met Richards in the street. \"Well, Mr. Richards, I was in New York the other day, and saw your man; but he knew nothing about Speyer.\" Richards laughed. \"I dare say not; just let me write to him; he will tell me a different story. I used to be hand and glove with all these refugees; and I will lay you any bet I find Speyer\u0027s whereabouts within a week.\" Accordingly, three or four days after, Richards called at Morton\u0027s lodgings, with an air of great self-satisfaction. \"I have spotted your game for you, sir, and he won\u0027t run away in a hurry, either. He\u0027ll be sure to wait till you come. He\u0027s in jail.\" \"What, for debt?\" \"No, for an assault on a Frenchman. It was about a woman, a friend of Speyer\u0027s. You know I told you what a jealous fellow he is.\" And he proceeded to recount what further information he had gained. \"Odd,\" pondered Richards, after parting from Morton, \"that a millionnaire like him, and not at all a mean man either, should trouble himself so much about any picayune debt that Speyer can owe him. There is something in this business more than I can make out.\" While Richards occupied himself with these reflections, Morton repaired to his lodgings and made his preparations. On the next morning, he was in New York again. He went to the jail where Speyer was confined, and readily gained leave to see him. A somewhat loquacious officer, who was to conduct him to the prisoner\u0027s room, confirmed what Richards had told him, and gave him some new particulars. Speyer, he said, had never before, to his knowledge, come under the notice of the police. He had been living in good lodgings, and in a somewhat showy style. The person who had occasioned the quarrel was an Italian girl. \"She comes every day to see him,\" said the policeman—\"she\u0027s a wild one, I tell you; and he frets himself to death because he is shut up here, and can\u0027t be round to look after her.\" \"So much the better,\" thought Morton, who hoped that this impatience would aid him in his intended negotiation. \"For how long a time is he sentenced?\" he asked. \"For three weeks; unless he can find somebody to pay his fine for him.\" On entering the prisoner\u0027s room, Morton saw a man of about forty, well dressed, though in a jail, but whose sallow features, deep-set eyes, and square, massive lower jaw, well covered with a black beard, indicated a character likely to be any thing but tractable. If he had been either a gentleman on the one hand, or a common ruffian on the other, his visitor might have better known how to deal with him; but he had the look of one to whom, whatever he might be at heart, a various contact with mankind had armed with an invincible self-possession, and guarded at all points against surprise. Morton was a wretched diplomatist, and had sense enough to know it. He knew that if he tried to manoeuvre with his antagonist, the latter would outflank him in a moment, and he had therefore resolved on a sudden and direct attack. But when he saw Speyer, he could not repress a lingering doubt whether he were in fact the person of whom he was in search. His chief object was to gain from him, if possible, any letters of Vinal which might be in his hands. There was no direct evidence that he had any such letters; yet Morton thought that the only hope of success lay in assuming his having them as a certainty, and pretending a positive knowledge, where, in truth, he had no other ground of action than conjecture. So he smothered his doubts, and as soon as the policeman was gone, made a crashing onset on the enemy. \"My name is Vassall Morton. I escaped four months ago from the Castle of Ehrenberg. I have known something of you through Mr. Vinal.\" If Morton were in doubt before, all his doubts were now scattered, for a look of irrepressible surprise passed across Speyer\u0027s features, mingled with as much dismay as his nature was capable of feeling. At the next instant, every trace of it had disappeared; and slowly shaking his head, to indicate unconsciousness, he looked at Morton inquiringly, with an eye perfectly self-possessed and impenetrable. His visitor, however, was not to be so deceived. \"I have no enmity against you, nor any wish to injure you. On the contrary, I will pay your fine, and set you free, if you will have it so. You have letters concerning me, written to you by Vinal. Give them to me, and I will do as I say. No harm shall come to you, and I will give you money to carry you to any part of the world you wish.\" \"What letters?\" asked Speyer. \"We will have no bush-beating. You wish to get out of jail, and have good reason for wishing to get out at once. If you will give me those letters, you shall be free in three hours, and safe. If you will not, I may give you some trouble.\" Speyer was silent for a moment. \"I know the letters are of use to you. You can play a profitable game with them; but I can stop your game at any moment I please.\" \"I can get four thousand dollars for them to-morrow,\" said Speyer. \"Then why are you here in jail?\" \"Vinal offers it; here it is.\" And taking a note from his pocket, Speyer read Vinal\u0027s proposal to buy the letters. \"Let me see it,\" said Morton, taking the note from Speyer\u0027s hand. \"This, of itself, is evidence against him. With your leave, I will keep it. Now hear my offer. Give me the letters, and I will pay your fine. Then go with me to Boston, and I will make Vinal pay you on the spot every dollar that he has offered, on condition that you promise to leave the United States, and never return.\" Speyer reflected. He came to the conclusion that Morton did not mean to expose Vinal; but only, like himself, to extort money from him; and wished that he, Speyer, should leave the country in order to get rid of a competitor. Morton\u0027s object was quite different. He could not foresee to what extremities Speyer\u0027s extortion might drive its victim; and he aimed to check it, by no means out of any tenderness for Vinal, but lest his wife might suffer from its consequences. Speyer, on his part, fevered with jealousy, was chafing to be at large again. \"When will you pay my fine?\" \"Now.\" \"Then I accept your proposal.\" \"Can I rely on your promise to leave the country, and make no further drafts on Vinal?\" Speyer cast a glance at him, as if he had read his mind. \"I will promise.\" \"Will you swear?\" Speyer readily took the oath, insisting that Morton should swear in turn to keep his part of the condition. \"Now let me see the letters.\" \"I must send to my lodgings for them. If you will come back in two hours, you shall have them.\" \"I should have thought you would keep them by you.\" \"No; but they are safe. Come back at twelve with the money for my fine, and they shall be here for you.\" Morton had no sooner left the room, than Speyer despatched an underling of the jail to buy for him a few sheets of the thin, half-transparent paper in common use for European correspondence. This being brought, he opened his trunk, and delving to the bottom, drew up a leather case, from which he took the letters in question. Laying the thin paper over them, he proceeded to trace with a pen an exact facsimile. He was well practised at such work, and after one or two failures, succeeded perfectly. Folding his counterfeits after the manner of the originals, he placed them in the envelopes belonging to the latter; and within a half hour after his task was finished, Morton reappeared. Speyer gave him one of the facsimiles. He read it attentively, without seeing the imposture. The handwriting, though disguised, was evidently Vinal\u0027s; but it had neither the signature of the writer, nor Morton\u0027s name. The place of each was supplied by a cipher. \"Reference is made here to another letter. Where is it?\" Speyer gave him the second counterfeit. The envelope bore a postmark of a few days later than the first. The note contained merely the names of Morton and Vinal, with ciphers affixed, referring to those in the first letter. \"Have you no more of Vinal\u0027s papers?\" Speyer shook his head. Indeed, the letters, if genuine, would have been amply sufficient to place their writer in Morton\u0027s power. The latter at once took the necessary measures to gain the prisoner\u0027s release. Speyer no sooner found himself at liberty than he hastened to search out the fair object of his anxieties, promising to meet Morton on the steamboat for Boston in the afternoon. His doubts were strong whether the other would keep faith with him; but he amply consoled himself with the thought that, at the worst, he still had means to bring Vinal to terms. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78674.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
