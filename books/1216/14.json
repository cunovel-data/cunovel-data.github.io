{"id":38099,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV.","content":"* * * One fire burns out another\u0027s burning, One pain is lessened by another\u0027s anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; One desperate grief cures with another\u0027s languish. Take thou some new infection to thine eye, And the rank poison of the old will die.—Romeo and Juliet. All day the train whirled along, and Morton\u0027s troubled thoughts found no rest. \"Matherton!\" cried the conductor, opening the door of the car, as the engine stopped in a large station house, at five o\u0027clock in the afternoon. Several passengers got out; two or three came in; the bell rang, and with puffing and clanking, the train was on its way again. A newsboy passed down the car with a bundle of newspapers and twopenny novels. Morton bought one of the latter as an anodyne; but even \"Orlando Melville, or the Victim of the Press Gang,\" failed to produce the desired soporific effect, and his thoughts soon recurred to their former channel. Suddenly a violent concussion, a crashing, thumping, and grating sound, the outcries of a hundred passengers,—the women screaming, and some of the men not silent,—with a furious rocking and tossing of the car, ejected every thought but one of his personal safety. All sprang to their feet, he among the rest. The first distinct impression which his mind received was that of the man in front of him making a flying leap out of the open window of the car, carrying the sash with him—a dexterous piece of gymnastics, only to be accounted for by the fact that the performer was a distinguished artist of the Grand National Olympic Circus. His boots twinkled at the window, and he was gone, alighting on his feet like a cat, but Morton was too much frightened to laugh. In a few moments the car came to a rest, without being overturned, though the front was partly broken in, and the whole swung off the rails to an angle of forty-five degrees. On looking out at the window, the first object that met Morton\u0027s eye was the baggage car, thrown on its side, with the door uppermost. As he looked, the door opened, and a head emerged—like a triton from the deep, or Banquo\u0027s ghost from a trap door—white with wrath and fright, and swearing with wonderful volubility. Then appeared another, rising by the side of the first, equally pallid, but much less profane. The heads belonged to two men, who had been seated in the compartment of the baggage car allotted to the mails, and when it was flung off the track, had been rattled together like dice in a box, suffering various bruises, but no serious harm. The breaking of the defective cast iron axle of the tender had caused the whole disaster, which would doubtless have produced fatal consequences had not the train been moving at a very slow rate. As it happened, a few contusions were its worst results, and one of the morning papers, \"for profound And solid lying much renowned,\" solemnly averred that none but Providence was responsible for it. There was abundant noise and vociferation. The passengers left the train, some lending their bungling aid to repair the mischief, while others withdrew to an inn which chanced to be in the neighborhood. After looking for a time at the downfallen tender and the uprooted rails, Morton, from some idle impulse, entered the car which he had lately left. It was empty; and, passing through it, he looked into that immediately behind, which had remained safely upon the rails. This also was empty, with the exception of a single person, a young female figure, seated at one of the windows. She was closely veiled, yet there was in her air that indefinable something which told Morton at a glance that she was a lady. He stepped to the ground, conjecturing whether or no she had a companion. Five minutes after, glancing at the window, he saw the solitary traveller seated in the same position as before, and became convinced that she was unattended. The women in the train had left it at the outset. The busy and clamorous throng of men alone remained; and Morton easily conceived that her situation must be an embarrassing one. He therefore re?ntered the car and approached her. \"I am afraid we shall be detained here for two or three hours, and perhaps till late at night. There is a public house a little way off, to which the ladies in the train have gone. If you will allow me, I will show you the way.\" So he spoke; or, rather, so he would have spoken; but he had scarcely begun when the veiled head was joyfully raised, and the veil was thrown aside, disclosing to his astonished eyes the features of Edith Leslie. She explained that she was on her way from her father\u0027s country seat at Matherton; and that he was to meet her at the station on the arrival of the train. When the accident took place, she had been led to suppose, from the conversation of two men near her, that the train would not be very long detained, and had preferred remaining in the car to mingling with the tumultuous throng outside. \"It is too fine an afternoon,\" said Morton, as they left the spot, \"to be mured in that tavern. This lane has an inviting look. Have you a mind to explore it?\" They walked accordingly in the direction he proposed; and, as they did so, Morton cast many a stolen glance at the face of his companion. The mind of the young philosopher was that day in a peculiarly susceptible state. It seemed as if Fanny Euston had kindled within him a flame which could not fix itself upon her, yet must needs find fuel somewhere; and as his eye met that of Edith Leslie, he began to feel that she held a deeper place in his thoughts than he had ever before suspected. By the side of the lane stood an ancient abode, whose rotten shingles supported a rich crop of green mosses; and in the yard an old man, who looked like a relic of Bunker Hill fight, was diligently chopping firewood. \"What does this lane lead to?\" asked Morton, looking over the fence. The woodchopper leaned on his axe, wiped his brows with the tatters of a red handkerchief, and seemed revolving the expediency of communicating the desired information. \"Well,\" he returned, after mature reflection, \"if you go fur enough, it\u0027ll take you down to the Diamond Pool.\" \"The Diamond Pool,\" said Miss Leslie; \"that has a promising sound.\" The lane soon began to lead them down the side of a rugged hill, between barberry bushes and stunted savins, with neglected stone walls, where the striped ground squirrels chirruped as they dodged into the crevices. In a few moments they had a glimpse of the water, shining between the branches of the trees below. \"Upon my word,\" said Morton, as they stood on the margin, \"the Diamond Pool is not to be despised. We have chosen our walk well, and found a tempting place of rest at the end of it.\" \"A grassy bank,—a clear spring, with cardinal flowers along the edge—a cluster of maple trees——\" \"And a flat rock at the foot of one of them, for you to rest upon. We are well provided for.\" \"Except that a seat for you seems to have been forgotten.\" \"No, if I wish to rest, this mound of grass will serve my turn. I am used to bivouacs.\" The sun had just vanished behind the rocky hill on the farther side of the water; a sea of liquid fire, clouds blazoned in gold and crimson, betokened his recent presence. The lake lay like a great mirror framed in green. Another sunset glowed in its depths; rocks, hills, and trees grew downward; and the kingfisher, as he flitted over it, made a dash at the surface, as if to peck at the adversary bird, which seemed shooting upward to meet him. \"One might imagine,\" said Miss Leslie, \"that we were a hundred miles away from railroads, factories, and all abominations of the kind.\" \"They will follow soon,\" said Morton; \"they are not far off. There is no sanctuary from American enterprise.\" \"I know it is omnipotent at spoiling a landscape; but I hope that this one may escape,—at least if there is no mill privilege in the neighborhood.\" \"There is—an excellent one—at the outlet of the pond, beyond the three elms yonder. I prophesy that in five years there will be a brick factory on that meadow, with a row of one story houses for the operatives.\" \"It will be a scandal and a profanation. It is too beautiful for such base uses. But at least that old cedar tree, rooted in a cleft of the precipice, has found a safe sanctuary. There it was growing in King Philip\u0027s time; in its younger days it saw Indian wigwams standing on this bank; and there its offspring will grow after it, safe from Yankee axes.\" \"One cannot be sure of that. A time will come yet, when those rocks will be blasted to build a town hall, or open another railroad track.\" \"But they cannot build railroads and factories in the clouds. Our New England sunsets will still remain to remind one that there is an ideal side of life—something in it besides locomotives and cotton gins.\" \"There it is that you are wiser than we are. You are mistresses of a domain of which men, for the most part, know little or nothing.\" \"Pray what domain may that be?\" \"One that is all mystery to me—a world of thoughts and sentiments which to most men is a cloudland, an undiscovered country, of which they may possibly recognize the existence, but of whose geography they know nothing.\" \"Why should they be more ignorant of it than women?\" \"Because they are commonly given over to practicalities, mixed hopelessly with rivalries and ambitions. Even in their highest pursuits, they propose to themselves some definite point to be gained, some object to be achieved; but women are left to the world of their own minds—there they can expatiate at will.\" \"That is a dangerous privilege.\" \"They have leisure to muse on the joys and troubles of life, and explore depths which we bridge over.\" \"Either your mind has very much changed, or I have very much mistaken it. Pardon me, but I fancied that you were like Iago, \u0027nothing if not critical;\u0027 or at least that you sympathized with his slanderous opinions of womankind.\" \"Heaven forbid! What treasonable thought did you suppose me to harbor against the better part of humanity?\" \"At all events, I never supposed you to believe that the better part of humanity passed their leisure time in metaphysical reveries and abstruse meditations.\" \"You were speaking, just now, of ideals. May not I have mine?\" \"So your ideal woman is a transcendental philosopher, seated in the midst of your undiscovered cloudland.\" \"Deliver me from such a one! My ideal is full of thought and of feeling; but no one yet ever dreamed of branding her as a philosopher. But why did you think me so very critical? I am hardly old enough yet to make an Iago or a Rochefoucault.\" \"And yet you used always to have some saying of Rochefoucault at your tongue\u0027s end.\" \"I detest him, nevertheless, for a French Mephistopheles,—and all his tribe with him.\" \"When I said as much, you always told me that his sayings had a great deal of truth in them.\" \"And have they not a great deal of truth?\" \"I cannot pretend to know mankind well enough to answer; but I sincerely hope, not much. Life would be worse than a blank if men and women were what he represents them to be.\" \"I think not; for if one cannot learn to be enthusiastic in regard to the actualities of human nature, he can console himself by a boundless faith in its possibilities. And now and then, thank God,—Rochefoucault to the contrary notwithstanding,—one finds the possibility realized.\" His companion made no reply; and Morton stood for a moment with his eyes bent upon her face, which, to his enamoured fancy, seemed to reflect the calm beauty of the landscape on which she was gazing. He thought of Fanny Euston; he recalled his last evening\u0027s conversation with her, and felt blindly impelled to give some form of expression to the feeling which began to master him. \"Miss Leslie, were you ever in a storm at sea?\" \"Yes, in a slight one; but the ship was strong; there was very little danger.\" \"Then you were never flung about, as I have been, in an indifferent egg shell of a craft, out of sight of land, at the mercy of winds and waves.\" \"I did not know that you had been at sea. Ah, yes, you were at school in France, when you were a boy—were you not?\" \"Yes; but this happened since I have become a man, and not long ago. I think I shall never forget it. The sun was bright at one moment, and all was black as a hurricane the next. The wind came from every point of the compass—always shifting, never resting. I had not an instant\u0027s peace. It was all watching—all anxiety—and yet there was a kind of pleasure in it. If I had had wings, I doubt if I should have found heart to use them. It was a strange gale. It blew hot and cold by fits; I thought I should lose my reckoning altogether, and be blown away, body and soul.\" \"Really, I cannot imagine where your tempest is going to carry you.\" \"Nor could I; when, of a sudden, I found myself safe on shore. My good star led me to a place beautiful as the May sunshine could make it; a scene where art and nature were blended so harmoniously, that they seemed to have grown together from the same birth; full of repose, and tranquil, graceful power; such a scene, in short, as made me wish that Nature would embody herself in a visible form, that I might swear homage to her forever.\" Had an interpreter been needed, Morton\u0027s look and voice must have betrayed, at least, some part of his meaning. The color deepened slightly on his companion\u0027s cheek, but she replied, without any further sign of consciousness,— \"I never knew that you were quite so ardent a votary of nature. You had better put your emotions into verse, and sell them to the magazines, after the true poetic custom. In a little time, I don\u0027t doubt, Dr. Griswold would find a place for you in his constellation of poets.\" \"Ah,\" said Morton, \"it is cruel of you to fling cold water on my rhapsodies. But my flight is over. And now I will try my best to gain the esteem in your eyes of a man of sense and a sound mind.\" \"And now those night-hawks over head are beginning to tell us that we had better go back to the railroad. I suppose you will place it among the other frailties of women; but I cannot help being a little afraid that if we stay longer, that crippled train will run away and leave us behind.\" \"Then good night to the Diamond Pool,\" said Morton, as they left the place. \"I shall not forget it; I owe it double thanks. It has shown me a pretty landscape, and made me a wiser man.\" \"I can hardly see how that may be.\" \"It has taught me not to speak too earnestly with my friend, lest she should banter me; and by no means to be drawn into any absurdity, lest she should laugh at me outright.\" \"Do you mean that you thought that I laughed at you?\" \"Did you not?\" \"If I gave you cause to think that I did, I can only say, frankly and heartily, that I am very sorry for it.\" \"Now I am emboldened to be absurd again, and speak more parables. I have found a locked-up treasure—a sealed fountain. I long to open it, but cannot.\" \"Your figures are too deep for me. I can make nothing of them.\" \"Then I will sink to plain prose. I have a friend whose heart is full of warm feeling and earnest thought; but, out of reserve, or Heaven knows what, she will express it to nobody but one or two intimate companions. She tantalizes the rest with a bantering word; and sometimes, when she is most in earnest, she seems to be most in jest. But why do you smile?\" \"Ask your friend Mr. Sharpe. He is your friend—is he not?\" \"I suppose so, though he is old enough to be my father. But why should I ask him?\" \"Because he once described to me a person very much like the one you have just described.\" \"Who was the person?\" \"Mr. Sharpe said that, though he was in general quite frank and undisguised, yet, if he were particularly in earnest on any subject, he was apt to speak lightly of it, or perhaps ridicule it, to hide his real feeling.\" \"Pray, who was this person? What was his name?\" \"Mr. Vassall Morton.\" \"Did Sharpe say that of me? It is not a month since I was walking with him,—his evening constitutional,—and he said the very same thing of you. Now, as I hope to live an honest man, I was never half so much flattered in my life, as by being slandered in such company.\" Here he was interrupted abruptly, for, turning a corner, they came full upon the inn, or hotel, as its sign proclaimed it to be. Discontented male passengers were lounging about the bar room; disconsolate female passengers sat, in bonnets and shawls, in the parlor; and an unspeakable air of uneasiness and discomfort pervaded the whole place. \"Our walk is over,\" sighed Morton; \"I wish it had a more propitious ending. And now let me be your courier, or do your commands in any other capacity in which I can serve you.\" At eleven o\u0027clock that night the train rolled into the station house at Boston, some four hours behind its time. \"My father will certainly be here,\" said Miss Leslie; but her father was nowhere to be seen. Morton conducted her to a carriage. Her trunks and his own had already been placed upon it, when, by the lantern of one of the porters, Morton descried the agitated colonel threading the crowd in anxious search of his daughter. He had been waiting nervously since seven o\u0027clock, and, when the train came in, had looked for her in every place but the right one. Morton hastened to relieve his fears. \"What do you mean to do with yourself to-night?\" Leslie asked, as the carriage drove towards his house. \"Drive to my house in the country.\" \"Your people will not expect you, and will be in bed before you can get there. You had much better come home with me.\" Morton was but too glad to accept the invitation. Having bade good night to his host and his host\u0027s daughter, he passed some hours in dreamy cogitation; then tried to sleep; but sleep long kept aloof, the consciousness of being under the same roof with Edith Leslie brought with it so strange a sensation. But as delicate health, that grand auxiliary of sentiment, was quite unknown to him, nature prevailed in the end, and at seven the next morning, a servant\u0027s knock wakened him from a deep sleep, a vision of Mount Katahdin, and an imaginary moose hunt. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78630.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
