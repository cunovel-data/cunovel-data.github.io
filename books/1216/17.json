{"id":38102,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII.","content":"Beshrew me, but I love her heartily, For she is wise, if I can judge of her; And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true; And true she is, as she hath proved herself; And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul.—Merchant of Venice. A week after he had heard the tidings from the old housekeeper, Morton saw Dr. Steele coming out of a patient\u0027s door and getting into his chaise. \"Good morning, Dr. Steele.\" \"Sir, your servant,\" said the old-fashioned doctor. \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that Mrs. Leslie is so ill.\" \"It\u0027s very sad,\" said the doctor. \"Now, what the deuse is this young fellow stopping me for?\"—this was his internal comment. \"I hope you don\u0027t despair of her.\" \"Well, sir, she will hold out to-morrow, and the next day, too.\" \"I beg your pardon. Your check rein is loose. Let me make it right.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Morton,\" said the doctor, somewhat mollified. \"Ahem!—Colonel Leslie is well, I hope.\" \"Apparently so, sir.\" \"And—ahem!—his family, too.\" \"I wasn\u0027t aware he had a family.\" \"I mean—that is to say—his daughter—Miss Leslie.\" The shrewd doctor turned his gray eyes sideways on the querist. \"Ah, his daughter. What did you wish to know of her, sir?\" \"Merely to inquire——\" said Morton, stammering and blushing visibly. \"I mean only to ask if she is well.\" \"I know nothing to the contrary. She seemed very well when I brought her down from Matherton last evening. I dare say, though, she can tell you herself a great deal better than I can. Good morning, Mr. Morton.\" And with a slight twinkle in his eye, Dr. Steele drove off. Morton looked after the chaise, as it lumbered down the street. \"May I be hanged and quartered if I ever question you again; you are too sharp, by half.\" The doctor\u0027s information was very welcome, however; and, armed with an anxious inquiry after her mother\u0027s health, Morton proceeded to call upon Miss Leslie. She had come to the city, as he had already judged, on some mission connected with the wants of the invalid, and was to go back to Matherton, with Dr. Steele, in the afternoon. Thenceforward, for a week or upwards, he saw her no more; but, during the interval, he contrived, by various expedients, to keep himself advised of the condition and movements of the family at Matherton. Among other incidents, he became aware of two visits made them by Vinal, and was tormented, in consequence, with an unutterable jealousy. One morning he met the purblind old housekeeper, mousing along in spectacles through the crowded street, and, stopping her, to her great alarm and perplexity, he made his usual inquiry concerning Mrs. Leslie\u0027s health. This investigation led to the discovery that Miss Edith was coming from Matherton that very afternoon. Morton, upon this, grew so restless, that he could not refrain from going to the railroad station, a little before the train was to come in. And here his worst fear was realized; for he beheld, slowly pacing along the platform, the hated form of Horace Vinal. Morton retreated unseen, went into a neighboring hotel, and seated himself, a little withdrawn from a window, where he could see all that passed. The train arrived; and soon after Vinal appeared, conducting Miss Leslie to a carriage, with an air, as Morton thought, of the most anxious devotion. He grasped his walking stick, and burned with a feverish longing to break it across his rival\u0027s back. He saw Miss Leslie on the next day, and thus added fuel to a flame which already burned high enough. In short, he found himself in that most profoundly serious and profoundly ridiculous of all conditions, the condition of being over head and ears in love,—and his zeal for science was merged utterly in a more engrossing devotion. By one means or another, he contrived to keep pace with the course of things at Matherton, and learned from day to day that Mrs. Leslie was worse,—that she seemed to revive a little,—that she was on the point of death,—that she was dead. By the time this sad climax was reached, he had been starving a fortnight from the sight of his mistress, having the consolation to know that meantime his rival had made at least four visits to Matherton. One morning Morton was pacing the street in an abstracted mood, his looks bent on the bricks, when, chancing to look up, he saw those very eyes which his fancy had been that moment picturing, employed in guiding their owner\u0027s steps over a crossing towards him. As Edith Leslie stepped upon the sidewalk, she saw him for the first time. He bowed, joined her, spoke a few bungling words of condolence, and walked on at her side. After the fashion of those who are peculiarly anxious to appear at their best advantage, he appeared at his worst. And when his companion bade him good morning on the steps of her father\u0027s house, she left him in a most unenviable mood, muttering maledictions against himself and his fate, and brought, indeed, to the borders of despair. This depression, however, was not long in producing its reaction, under the influence of which, adopting his usual panacea against mental ailments, he mounted his horse, and spurred into the country. Here, about sunset, he beheld a horseman, slowly pacing along the road in front. On this, he drew rein, and began to look about him for the means of escape; for in the person of the rider he recognized his classmate Wren, to whose society he was far from partial. Neither lane nor by-road was to be seen. \"At the worst,\" he thought, \"it is but a mile or two;\" and, setting forward at a trot again, he was in a moment at his classmate\u0027s side. \"How are you, Wren?\" \"Ah, Morton, good evening,\" exclaimed Wren, with a graceful wave of his hand. \"I\u0027m delighted to see you. A charming evening—isn\u0027t it?\" \"Charming.\" \"That\u0027s a fine horse you have.\" \"Tolerably good.\" \"Did you ever observe this fellow that I\u0027m riding? Do you see how long and straight he is in the back? Well, that\u0027s the Arab blood that\u0027s in him. His grandfather was a superb Arab, that the Pacha of Egypt gave my uncle when he was travelling there;\" and he proceeded to dilate at large on the merits and pedigree of his horse, the truth being that he and his ancestry before him had been born and bred in the State of Vermont. Morton listened with civil incredulity, and wished his companion at the antipodes. \"Ah, there\u0027s my cousin\u0027s house,\" exclaimed Wren, pointing to a very pretty cottage and grounds which they were approaching—\"Mary Holyoke, you know—Mary Everard that was some three months ago. What a delightful retreat for the honeymoon!\" \"Very,\" said Morton. \"Stop there with me, will you? I\u0027m going in for a few minutes, to wish them a pleasant journey. They are going to Niagara to-morrow.\" \"Thank you, I believe I won\u0027t stop.\" \"As you please, my dear fellow. I think they are quite right to travel now; it\u0027s a better season than the spring; and a honeymoon journey, after all, isn\u0027t all romance, you know. Besides, they are going to have a charming companion—Miss Leslie.\" \"I thought that she had just lost her mother-in-law.\" \"That\u0027s the very thing. She\u0027s almost ill with watching night after night; so Mary,—they used to be friends at school,—has been very anxious that she should make the journey with them, for a change of scene, you know,—and Colonel Leslie has persuaded her to go.\" \"When will they leave town?\" \"To-morrow. They mean to spend a few days at Trenton, and then go to the Falls. But here we are; won\u0027t you change your mind, and come in?\" \"No, thank you. Good night.\" \"Good evening, then;\" and waving his hand again, Wren trotted up the avenue. \"Virtue never goes unrewarded,\" thought Morton; \"if I hadn\u0027t joined the fellow, I might not have known about this journey.\" On the next day he discovered that they had actually gone, and that, as Wren had said, Niagara was to be the ultimatum of their tour. On the following morning, he himself took the western train, and made all speed for the Falls. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78633.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
