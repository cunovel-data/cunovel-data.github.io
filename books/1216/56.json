On the next morning he was walking near the Court House, when a man accosted him, touching his hat with one hand, and holding out the other in the way of friendly salutation. Morton, however, was at a loss to recognize him. He had an air which may most conveniently be described as raffish, a hat set on one side of his head, and a good-natured, easy, devil-may-care face. \"Richards is my name,\" said the stranger. \"I met you at Paris, just before you went into Austria.\" This was quite enough. Morton, who had repeatedly revolved all the circumstances connected with his arrest, at once recalled the accident by which he had discovered Richards and Vinal, on their way together to visit Speyer. Morton determined to cultivate this new acquaintance; which, however, seemed likely to grow without much tillage. \"I went on two or three excursions about the city with you, Mr. Vinal, and the rest. Perhaps you have not forgotten it.\" \"Not in the least; but you are changed since then.\" \"Yes,\" said Richards, touching the place where his moustaches had once grown, \"I cut them off when I went into practice here in Boston. I found they were ruining my character as a professional man.\" \"How long were you in Paris after I saw you?\" \"Two years, off and on. I wish I were there now.\" And taking Morton\u0027s arm, he proceeded to catechize him touching his imprisonment and escape, of which he said he had first read in the New York Herald. Morton satisfied his curiosity, taking care to give him no suspicion of Speyer\u0027s connection with the affair, and allowing him to infer that the arrest was caused by an accidental concurrence of suspicious circumstances. Richards, at the end, broke out into a savage, red republican tirade against Metternich and the Austrian government. \"By the way,\" said Morton, when his companion\u0027s heat had subsided, \"do you happen to remember a man called Speyer, or something like it,—a republican propagandist, at Paris? I believe you knew him.\" \"I never knew any body else,\" replied Richards, adopting a cis-Atlantic figure of speech for which rhetoricians have as yet found no name. \"Do you know where he is now?\" \"What, have you lent money to Speyer, too?\" \"He is heavily in my debt,\" said Morton, evasively. \"That\u0027s odd. He seems to have been borrowing money all round. I remember, about a year or more ago, I met Mr. Vinal, and he began to talk about Paris. \u0027By the way,\u0027 said he to me, \u0027do you happen to remember a man named Spires, or Speyers, or some such thing? I lent him five hundred francs.\u0027 \u0027I wish you may get it,\u0027 said I. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Vinal, \u0027I have a friend going to Paris, who will try what can be done for me.\u0027 So I set him on the track. I don\u0027t know whether he got his money or not, but I saw him talking with Speyer in the street, one evening last spring, and Vinal looked as sour as if he had swallowed a bottle of vitriol.\" \"Talking with Speyer last spring!\" repeated Morton; \"has he been to Paris?\" \"Speyer has come out to America. There is not a country in Europe but has grown too hot for him. He was under surveillance in Paris, all the time I knew him.\" \"When did he come?\" \"Six or eight months ago.\" \"Where is he to be found?\" \"In New York, chiefly. If you could have caught him when he was here in Boston, in the spring, you might have got something out of him; for he seemed flush of money.\" \"What, after you saw him with Vinal?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have you seen him more than once in Boston?\" \"Yes, two or three times.\" \"Is he in New York now?\" \"I suppose so; but I would not advise your trying to do any thing with him. You had better pocket your loss, and let him go. However, if you want to try, I can refer you to a man who can probably help you to find his whereabouts.\" \"Thank you; there\u0027s no harm in making the attempt. I don\u0027t know Speyer well. What kind of man is he?\" \"Well, I will draw his portrait for you. He is sly as a fox; always contriving, plotting, and working under ground. Intrigue is his native element. He takes to it like a chameleon to air, or a salamander to fire.\" \"An artful, managing fellow, not bold enough to make a direct attack?\" \"Bold! There is nothing on the earth, or under it, that he fears. He will not make a direct attack, if he can help it, because it is against his instinct; but press upon him—crowd him a little—and he will show his teeth like a Bengal tiger. He is always in hot water; for he never could be happy out of it. He has his weaknesses, though. A woman whom he takes a fancy to can turn him round her finger. I never knew a man so desperate in that way, or such a devil incarnate when a fit of jealousy seizes him.\" \"You draw a flattering likeness of your friend,\" said Morton.\" \"O,\" said Richards, laughing, \"I cut half my foreign acquaintance, now that I am at home.\" Before leaving his new companion, Morton obtained from him the name and direction of the person of whom he had spoken as likely to know where Speyer was to be found. Left alone at length, he pondered on what he had heard:— \"So Vinal applied to Richards, to learn Speyer\u0027s address, when he wrote to him to report me dead. Speyer in America!—having interviews with Vinal!—and flush of money! Can it be possible that this agent of his villany has become the instrument of his punishment?—that the Furies are already on his track? If Speyer kept Vinal\u0027s letter, as, under the circumstances, such a calculating knave would be apt to do, he has that in his hands which would make my friend open his purse strings; yes, make him coin his life blood, to satisfy him. It is past doubting; Vinal has it now; this cormorant is preying upon him.\" That afternoon Morton took the night train to New York, in search of Speyer.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78672.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
