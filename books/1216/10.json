When the summer heats set in, Meredith, one evening, drove to Morton\u0027s house, and, arrayed in linen and grass-cloth, smoked his cigar under his friend\u0027s veranda with as much contentment as the thermometer at ninety would permit. The window at his side was that of the room which Morton used as his study, and the table was covered with books. \"Colonel,\" said Meredith, \"what a painstaking fellow you are! Ever since you left college—except when you were off on that journey, which was one of the most rational things you ever did in your life—you have been digging here among your books, as if you were some half-starved law student, with a prospect of matrimony.\" \"I\u0027ve done digging for the present. It\u0027s against my principles to work much in July and August.\" \"What do you mean to do?\" \"Set out on a journey.\" \"I suppose so. You are a lucky fellow.\" \"Give yourself a vacation, and come with me.\" \"No, I\u0027m in for it for the next two months; but I will have my revenge before long.\" \"Three days from your office will never ruin you or your family. Come with me to New Baden, if you can\u0027t do better.\" \"I think I can manage that,—and I will.\" Accordingly, on Monday morning, they took the train thitherward. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78626.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
