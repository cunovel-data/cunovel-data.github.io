{"id":38154,"no":69,"title":"CHAPTER LXIX.","content":"Fal.—Reason, you rogue, reason; thinkest thou I\u0027ll endanger my soul gratis?—Merry Wives of Windsor. Pistol.—Base is the slave that pays.—Henry V. Time had been when, his youth considered, Vinal was a beaming star in the commercial heaven. On \u0027change, \"His name was great, In mouths of wisest censure.\" The astutest broker pronounced him good; the sagest money lender took his paper without a question. But of late, his signature had lost a little of its efficacy. It was whispered that he was not as sound as his repute gave out; that his operations were no longer marked by his former clear-headed forecast; that he was deep in doubtful and dangerous speculation. In short, his credit stood by no means where it had stood a twelvemonth earlier. Possibly these rumors took their first impulse, not on \u0027change, but at tea tables, and in drawing rooms. His wife\u0027s separation from him had given ample food to speculation; and gossip had for once been just, asserting, with few dissenting voices, that there must needs be some fault, and a grave one, on the part of Vinal. The event had ceased to be a very recent one; but surmise was still rife concerning its mysterious cause. Meanwhile, Vinal was being goaded into recklessness, frightened out of his propriety, haunted, devil-driven, maddened into desperate courses. Late one night, he was pacing his library, with a quick, disordered step. His servants were in their beds, excepting a man, nodding his drowsy vigil over the kitchen fire. Vinal\u0027s affairs were fast drawing to a crisis. A few weeks must determine the success or failure of a broad scheme of fraud, on which he had staked his fortunes and himself, and whose issues would sink him to disgrace and ruin, or lift him for a time to the pinnacle of a knave\u0027s prosperity. But, meanwhile, how to keep his head above water! Claims thickened upon him; he was meshed in a network of perplexities; and, with him, bankruptcy would involve far more than a loss of fortune. There was a ring at the door bell. Vinal stopped short in his feverish walk, raised his head with a startled motion, and listened like a fox who hears the hounds. His instinct foreboded the worst. His cheek flushed, and his eye brightened, not with spirit, but with desperation. The bell rang again. This time, the sleepy servant roused himself. Vinal heard his step along the hall; heard the opening of the street door, and a man\u0027s voice pronouncing his name. The moment after, his evil spirit stood before him, in the shape of Henry Speyer. Vinal gave him no time to speak, but shutting the door in the servant\u0027s face, turned upon his visitor with such courage as a cat will show when a bulldog has driven her into a corner. \"Again! Are you here again? It is hardly a month since you were here last. What have you done with what I gave you then? Do you think I am made of gold? Do you take me for a bank that you can draw on at will?\" \"I am sorry to trouble you so soon, but I am very hard pressed.\" \"Hard pressed! So am I hard pressed. Here for a year and more I have been supporting you in your extravagance—you and your mistresses; you have been living on me like princes,—dress, drinking, feasting, horses, gambling!—among you, you make my money spin away like water. Every well has a bottom to it, and you have got to the bottom of mine.\" Speyer laughed with savage incredulity. \"Any thing in reason I am ready to do for you; but it\u0027s of no use. More! more! is always the word. You think you have found a gold mine. You mistake. Here I have a note due to-morrow; and another on Monday—that was for money I borrowed to give you. Heaven knows how I shall pay them. Go back, and come again a month from this.\" \"It won\u0027t do. I must have it now.\" \"I tell you, I have none to give you.\" \"Do you see this?\" said Speyer, producing a roll of printed papers, and giving one to Vinal. It was Vinal\u0027s letter, in the form of a placard, with a statement of the whole affair prefixed. Speyer had had it printed secretly in New York, the names of Morton and Vinal being left blank, and ingeniously filled in by himself with a pen. \"Give me the money, or show me how to get it, or I will have you posted up at every street corner in town. I have your letter here. I shall send it to your friend, the editor of the Sink.\" The Sink was a scurrilous newspaper, which the virtuous Vinal, always anxious for the morals of the city, had once caused to be prosecuted as a nuisance, for which the editor bore him a special grudge. But Vinal at last was brought to bay. Threats, which Speyer thought irresistible, had lost their power. He threw back the paper, and said desperately, \"Do what you will.\" Speyer made a step forward, and faced his prey. \"Will you give me the money?\" \"By G—, no!\" \"By G—, you shall!\" And Speyer seized him by the breast of his waistcoat. Vinal had been trained in the habits of a gentleman. He had never known personal outrage before. He grew purple with rage. The veins of his forehead swelled like whipcord, and his eyes glittered like a rattlesnake\u0027s. \"Take off your hand!\" The words were less articulated than hissed between his teeth. \"Take off your hand.\" Speyer clutched him with a harder gripe, and shook him to and fro. Quick as lightning, Vinal struck him in the face. Speyer glared and grinned on his victim like an enraged tiger. For a moment, he shook him as a terrier shakes a rat; then flung him backward against the farther side of the room. Here, striking the wall, he fell helpless, among the window curtains and overturned chairs. Speyer would probably have followed up his attack; but at the instant, the servant, who, by a happy accident, was at the side door, in the near neighborhood of the keyhole, ran in in time to save Vinal from more serious discomfiture. Speyer hesitated; turned from one to the other with murder in his look; then, slowly moving backwards, left the room, whence the servant\u0027s valor did not mount to the point of following him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78685.html","bookId":1216,"book":{"id":1216,"title":"Vassall Morton","description":"简介： Remote from towns he ran his godly race.Goldsmith....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:36 AM"}}
