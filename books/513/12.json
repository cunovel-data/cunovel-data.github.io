It collapsed against the leathery cushions, the short arms and legs limp and dangling. The doctor patted his knee. \"Another few moments,\" he said. \"Where are we going?\" \"To the spaceport in Winnipeg. I have a friend there. He has two children of his own, both born in the Mars Colony. He\u0027ll be returning there within the week.\" \"And you want me to go with him?\" \"Yes, Ron.

An ailment without a name or a symptom, found only rarely in the bodies of a few space travelers. You had it, Ron, and in a year or two, it would have struck you down with the savagery and surprise of lightning. \"It was then that I agreed to the Scholar\u0027s plan to exchange bodies. Agreed to it on my own terms, with the body of Ron Carver....\" \"Then I\u0027ll die!\" Ron said. \"No, Ron. You will live. It\u0027s the Scholar who has made the bad bargain....\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3272/89526.html","bookId":513,"book":{"id":513,"title":"Brainchild","description":"简介： For one thing, the legs he swung off the narrow bed wouldn\u0027t touch the floor.
