Dr. Luther prepared something in a hypodermic syringe, while Dr. Minton strapped his former patient onto a padded examining table. \"Doctor ...\" Ron whispered. \"Hush, Ron. It\u0027s all right....\" \"But what is all this? Who am I?\" The doctor frowned. \"You\u0027re Ronald Carver. You\u0027re the same Ronald Carver you always were. But you have made an exchange of bodies. That is all.\" \"But why? How?\" \"I don\u0027t really know. God help us. It was his project from start to finish—that thing upstairs.\" \"Who is he?\" \"A phenomenon. A mutation. A freak. A genius. A god. I can\u0027t explain him. He was born twelve years ago, to normal parents in the middle west. He was a recognized prodigy at the age of six months, a mathematical wizard at one, a scientific genius at three.... You\u0027ve heard of this kind of thing, Ron. Once a generation, something like this. And once a millenium—a horror like this one.\" \"I don\u0027t understand! What is Project Scholar?\" \"He is. All by himself. The government has taken charge of his abilities, at least for the time being.\" He snorted. \"He\u0027s already done things I wouldn\u0027t have believed possible in five thousand years of evolution. And yet he is still only twelve years old....\" \"Only twelve?\" Ron squirmed in the straps. \"Doctor! This body—\" \"Yes, Ron. It\u0027s his, of course. He grew angry with it; wanted to discard it, like everything else which doesn\u0027t fit his conception of the fitness of things. It was awkward—a giant\u0027s brain in a child\u0027s body. So he developed a solution—an operation, involving the total transference of electrical energy....\" The doctor\u0027s shaggy head bowed. \"He needed human help for that. That\u0027s when I was brought in as assistant. And it was my function to select the perfect body as a temporary house for his ego....\" \"Temporary?\" \"When this body ages and grows feeble, there will be another. Our friend has outwitted Death itself.\" The doctor looked up, his jaw firm. \"I was instructed to destroy his body when the transference was completed. I couldn\u0027t do it, Ron. I managed to spirit you away where you would be cared for. It was almost a year before you came to your senses after the operation. By that time, I didn\u0027t know what to do with you. My first thought was the Roverwood Home, where I am a director, where you would be lost among many, many boys\u0027 faces....\" \"But why me, doctor? Why me?\" \"I had to choose someone, Ron. It was merely a question of who....\" Dr. Luther entered, priming the needle. \"Ready?\" he said. \"One moment.\" The doctor\u0027s hand covered Ron\u0027s mouth, and he felt the contours of a small round pill against his lips. He realized he was meant to swallow it, and he did. \"Ready now,\" Dr. Minton said. Dr. Luther performed the injection. \"Good night, sweet prince,\" he said gently. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3272/89522.html","bookId":513,"book":{"id":513,"title":"Brainchild","description":"简介： For one thing, the legs he swung off the narrow bed wouldn\u0027t touch the floor.
