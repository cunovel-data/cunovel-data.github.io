{"id":6221,"no":2,"title":"Prologue","content":"When I was a young man just out of law school and eager to get on with my life, on a whim I briefly put aside my reading preference for fiction and history and bought one of those how-to books: How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, by Alan Lakein. The books main point was the necessity of listing short-, medium-, and long-term life goals, then categorizing them in order of their importance, with the A group being the most important, the B group next, and the C the last, then listing under each goal specific activities designed to achieve them. I still have that paperback book, now almost thirty years old. And Im sure I have that old list somewhere buried in my papers, though I cant find it. However, I do remember the A list. I wanted to be a good man, have a good marriage and children, have good friends, make a successful political life, and write a great book.\\n\\n Whether Im a good man is, of course, for God to judge. I know that I am not as good as my strongest supporters believe or as I hope to become, nor as bad as my harshest critics assert. I have been graced beyond measure by my family life with Hillary and Chelsea. Like all families lives, ours is not perfect, but it has been wonderful. Its flaws, as all the world knows, are mostly mine, and its continuing promise is grounded in their love. No person I know ever had more or better friends. Indeed, a strong case can be made that I rose to the presidency on the shoulders of my personal friends, the now legendary FOBs.\\n\\n My life in politics was a joy. I loved campaigns and I loved governing. I always tried to keep things moving in the right direction, to give more people a chance to live their dreams, to lift peoples spirits, and to bring them together. Thats the way I kept score.\\n\\n As for the great book, who knows? It sure is a good story.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/309/371.html","bookId":201,"book":{"id":201,"title":"克林顿自传：My Life","description":"简介： 爱和漫骂，尊敬和愤慨，比尔克林顿Bill Clinton是当代一位具争议性的政治领袖。作为第42任美国总统，他推动了北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）的成立，并协助中国加入世界贸易组职（WTO）。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110523/1-110523135141C1.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/309","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:23 AM"}}
