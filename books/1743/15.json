{"id":70496,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"29 Five years had now passed since the Leaving. Crile Fisher found that hard to believe since it seemed so much longer than that, infinitely longer. Rotor was not in the past, but in another life altogether, one that he could only view with gathering incredulity. Had he really lived there? Had he had a wife? He remembered only his daughter clearly, and even that had its element of confusion, for sometimes it seemed to him he remembered her as a teenager. Of course, the problem was compounded by the fact that his life in the last three years, ever since Earth had discovered the Neighbor Star, had been a hectic one. He had visited seven different Settlements. All of these were inhabited by Settlers of his own skin shade who spoke more or less his language and shared more or less his cultural orientation. (That was the advantage of Earth\u0027s variety. Earth could supply an agent similar in appearance and culture to the general population of any Settlement.) Of course, there was a limit to how closely he could melt into any Settlement. No matter how he matched its population superficially, he still had a distinctive accent of speech, he could not remain as graceful as they under changes of gravitational pull, he could not skim along as they did in low gravity. In a dozen ways, he betrayed himself on each Settlement he visited, and always they withdrew from him just slightly, even though, in each case, he had gone through quarantine and medical treatment before being allowed to even enter the Settlement proper. Of course, he remained on each Settlement only a few days to a few weeks. Never was he expected to remain on a Settlement on a semi-permanent basis or to build himself a family there as he had done on Rotor. But then Rotor had had hyper-assistance, and since then Earth had been looking for items of narrower importance, or at least he had been sent on tasks of narrower importance. He had been back now for three months. There was no word of a new assignment and he was not anxious for one. He was tired of the uprooting, tired of not fitting in, tired of the pretense of being a tourist. And there was Garand Wyler, his old friend and colleague, fresh from a Settlement of his own and staring at him with tired eyes. The dark skin of his graceful hand glimmered in the light as he raised his sleeve to his nose for a moment, then let it drop. Fisher half-smiled. He knew the gesture, had gone through it himself. Each Settlement had its own characteristic odor, depending on the crops it grew, the spices it used, the perfumes it affected, the very nature of the machinery and lubricants it used. It quickly went unnoticed, but on the return to Earth, the Settlement odor clung to one quite detectably. And though the person might be bathed, and the clothing washed so that others did not notice, one still noticed the smell on himself. Fisher said, \u0027Welcome back. How was your Settlement this time?\u0027 \u0027As always - terrible. Old Man Tanayama is correct. What all the Settlements fear and hate most is variety. They don\u0027t want differences in appearance, tastes, ways and life. They select themselves for uniformity and despise everything else.\u0027 Fisher said, \u0027You\u0027re right. And it\u0027s too bad.\u0027 Wyler said, \u0027That\u0027s a mild, unfeeling way of putting it. \"Too bad.\" \"Oops, I dropped the dish. Oh, too bad.\" \"Whoops, my contact seal is out of line. Oh, too bad.\" We\u0027re talking humanity here. We\u0027re talking about Earth\u0027s long struggle to find a way of living together, all cultures, all appearances. It isn\u0027t perfect yet, but compare it to how it was even a century ago, and it\u0027s heaven. Then, when we get a chance to move into space, we shuck it all off and move right back into the Dark Ages. And you say, \"Too bad.\" That\u0027s some reaction to something that\u0027s an enormous tragedy.\u0027 \u0027I agree,\u0027 said Fisher, \u0027but unless you can tell me something practical I can do about it, what does it matter how eloquently I denounce it? You were at Akruma, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Wyler. \u0027Did they know about the Neighbor Star?\u0027 \u0027Certainly. As far as I know, the news has now reached every Settlement.\u0027 \u0027Were they concerned?\u0027 \u0027Not a bit. Why should they be? They\u0027ve got thousands of years. Long before the Neighbor Star is anywhere near, and if it should seem to be dangerous, which isn\u0027t absolutely certain, you know, they can wander off. They can all wander off. They admire Rotor, and only wait for a chance to get away themselves.\u0027 Wyler was frowning, his tone bitter. He went on, \u0027They\u0027ll all leave, and we\u0027ll be stuck. How are we going to build enough Settlements for eight billion human beings and get them all away?\u0027 \u0027You sound just like Tanayama. What good will it do us to chase them down and punish them, or destroy them? We\u0027ll still be here and we\u0027ll still be stuck. If they all stayed behind like good kids and faced the Neighbor Star with us, would we be better off?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re cold about this, Crile. Tanayama is hot, and I\u0027m on his side. He\u0027s hot enough to pull the Galaxy apart if necessary to find hyper-assistance on our own. He wants it so we can chase after Rotor and blow them out of space, but even if that does no good, we\u0027re going to need hyper-assistance to get as many people off Earth as possible if it turns out that the Neighbor Star will make it necessary. So what Tanayama is doing is right, even if his motives are wrong.\u0027 \u0027And suppose we have hyper-assistance and then we find we only have the time and the resources to get a billion people off. Which is the billion that goes? And what happens if those who are in charge start saving only their own kind?\u0027 Wyler growled, \u0027It doesn\u0027t bear thinking of.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t,\u0027 agreed Fisher. \u0027Let\u0027s be glad we\u0027ll be long gone before even the barest beginning can be made.\u0027 \u0027If it comes to that,\u0027 said Wyler, his voice suddenly dropping. \u0027The barest beginning may already have been made. I suspect we have hyper-assistance now, or just about have it.\u0027 Fisher\u0027s expression was one of deep cynicism. \u0027What makes you think that? Dreams? Intuition?\u0027 \u0027No. I know a woman whose sister knows someone on the Old Man\u0027s staff. Will that do you?\u0027 \u0027Of course not. You\u0027ll have to give me more than that.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not in a position to. Look, Crile, I\u0027m your friend. You know I helped you get back your status in the Office.\u0027 Crile nodded. \u0027I do and I appreciate it. And I\u0027ve tried to make an adequate return now and then.\u0027 \u0027You have done so and I appreciate that. Now what I want to do is give you some information which is supposed to be confidential and which I think you will find useful and important. Are you ready to accept it and keep me clear?\u0027 \u0027Always ready.\u0027 \u0027You know what we\u0027ve been doing, of course.\u0027 Fisher said, \u0027Yes.\u0027 It was the kind of useless, rhetorical question that required no other answer. For five years agents of the Office (for the last three years, Fisher among them) had been rummaging in the informational garbage heaps of the Settlements. Scavenging. Every Settlement was working on hyper-assistance, just as Earth itself was, ever since the word had leaked out that Rotor had it, and certainly ever since Rotor had proved the fact by leaving the Solar System. Presumably most Settlements, perhaps all, had obtained some scrap of what it was that Rotor had done. By the Open Science Agreement, each one of those scraps should have been laid on the table and if all were then put together, it might have meant practical hyper-assistance for all. That, however, was clearly too much to ask in this particular case. There was no telling what useful side effects might be born of the new technique and no Settlement could abandon the hope that it might be first in the field and, in this way, gain an important lead on the others in one way or another. So each hoarded what it had - if it had anything - and not one of them had enough. And Earth itself, with its vastly elaborate Terrestrial Board of Inquiry, sniffed at all the Settlements indiscriminately. Earth was fishing, and Fisher, appropriately enough, was one of the fishermen. Wyler said slowly, \u0027We\u0027ve put what we\u0027ve got together and I gather it\u0027s enough. We\u0027ll be able to have hyper-assisted travel. And I\u0027m thinking we\u0027ll go out to the Neighbor Star. Wouldn\u0027t you want to be on that trip when it goes out there?\u0027 \u0027Why do I want to be on it, Garand? If there\u0027s going to be such a trip, which I doubt.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m pretty sure there will be. I can\u0027t give you my source, but take my word for it, it\u0027s reliable. And, of course, you\u0027ll want to make the trip. You might see your wife. Or if not her - your kid.\u0027 Fisher moved restlessly. It seemed to him he spent half his days now trying not to think of those eyes. Marlene would be six years old now, talking in a quiet deliberate way - like Roseanne. Seeing through people - like Roseanne. He said, \u0027You\u0027re talking nonsense, Garand. Even if there were such a flight, why would they let me be on it? They would send specialists of one sort or another. Besides, if there\u0027s one person the Old Man will keep off, it\u0027s me. He may have let me get back into the Office and given me assignments, but you know how he is about failures, and I certainly failed him on Rotor.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but that\u0027s the very point. That\u0027s what makes you a specialist. If he\u0027s going after Rotor, how can he fail to include the one Earthman who lived on Rotor for four years? Who would understand Rotor better and who would know better how to deal with them? Ask to see him. Point this out, but remember, you\u0027re not supposed to know that we have hyper-assistance. Just talk possibilities, make use of the subjunctive. And don\u0027t drag me into it in any way. I\u0027m not supposed to know about it either.\u0027 Fisher\u0027s brow furrowed in thought. Was it possible? He dared not hope. 30 The next day, while Fisher was still wondering whether to risk asking for an interview with Tanayama, the decision was taken out of his hands. He was summoned. A simple agent is rarely summoned by the Director. There are plenty of deputies to grind away at them. And if an agent is summoned by the Old Man, it is almost never good news. So Crile Fisher prepared himself with grim resignation for an assignment as an inspector of the fertilizer factories. Tanayama looked up at him from behind his desk. Fisher had seen him only rarely and briefly in the three years since Earth\u0027s discovery of the Neighbor Star, and he seemed unchanged. He had been small and shriveled for so long that there seemed no room for any further physical change. The sharpness of his eyes had not abated either, nor the withered grim set of his lips. He might even be wearing the same garments he had worn three years before. Fisher could not tell. But if the harsh voice, too, was the same, the tone was surprising. Apparently, in the face of astronomical odds, the Old Man had called him in for the purpose of praising him. Tanayama said in his queer, and not altogether unpleasant, distortion of Planetary English, \u0027Fisher, you have done well. I want you to hear that from me.\u0027 Fisher, standing (he had not been invited to sit down), managed to suppress his small start of surprise. The Director said, \u0027There can be no public celebration of this, no laser-beam parade, no holographic procession. It is not in the nature of things. But I tell you this.\u0027 \u0027That is quite enough, Director,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027I thank you.\u0027 Tanayama stared fixedly at Fisher out of his narrow eyes. Finally, he said, \u0027And is that all you have to say? No questions?\u0027 \u0027I presume, Director, you will tell me what I need to know.\u0027 \u0027You are an agent, a capable man. What have you found out for yourself?\u0027 \u0027Nothing, Director. I do not seek to find out anything but what I am instructed to find out.\u0027 Tanayama\u0027s small head nodded very slightly. \u0027An appropriate answer, but I seek inappropriate ones. What have you guessed?\u0027 \u0027You seem pleased with me, Director, and it may therefore be that I have brought in some information that has proved useful to you.\u0027 \u0027In what respect?\u0027 \u0027I think nothing would prove more useful to you than having obtained the technique of hyper-assistance.\u0027 Tanayama\u0027s mouth made a noiseless: \u0027Ah-h-h.\u0027 He said, \u0027And next? Assuming this to be so, what are we to do next?\u0027 \u0027Travel to the Neighbor Star. Locate Rotor.\u0027 \u0027Nothing better than that? That is all there is to do? You see no farther?\u0027 And at this point, Fisher decided it would be foolish not to gamble. He could not possibly be handed a better opportunity. \u0027One thing better: that, when the first Earth vessel goes out of the Solar System by means of hyper-assistance, I be on it.\u0027 Fisher had scarcely said that when he knew his gamble was lost - or at least not won. Tanayama\u0027s face darkened. He said in a sharply imperative tone, \u0027Sit down!\u0027 Fisher could hear the soft movement of the chair behind him, rolling toward him at the words of Tanayama, words that its primitive computerized motor could understand. Fisher sat down, without looking behind him to make certain the chair was there. To have done so would have been insulting and, at the present moment, there was no room to insult Tanayama. Tanayama said, \u0027Why do you want to be on the vessel?\u0027 With an effort, Fisher kept his voice level. \u0027Director, I have a wife on Rotor.\u0027 \u0027A wife you abandoned five years ago. Do you think she would welcome you back?\u0027 \u0027Director, I have a child.\u0027 \u0027She was one year old when you left. Do you think she knows she has a father? Or cares?\u0027 Fisher was silent. These were points that he had thought about himself, over and over. Tanayama waited briefly, then said, \u0027But there will be no flight to the Neighbor Star. There will be no vessel for you to be on.\u0027 Again, Fisher had to suppress surprise. He said, \u0027Forgive me, Director. You did not say we had hyper-assistance. You said, \"Assuming this to be so-\" I should have noted your choice of words.\u0027 \u0027So you should have done. So you should always do. Nevertheless, we do have hyper-assistance. We can now move through space, just as Rotor has done; or at least we will, once we build a vehicle and are sure the design is adequate, and all its features workable - which may take a year or two. But then what? Are you seriously suggesting we take it to the Neighbor Star?\u0027 Fisher said cautiously, \u0027Surely that is an option, Director.\u0027 \u0027A useless one. Think it out, man. The Neighbor Star is over two light-years away. No matter how skillfully we make use of hyper-assistance, it will take us more than two years to arrive there. Our theoreticians now tell me that while hyper-assistance will allow a ship to go faster than light for brief periods of time - the faster, the briefer - the end result is always that it cannot reach any point in space faster than a ray of light would have, if the two had started from the same point of origin.\u0027 \u0027But if that is so-\u0027 \u0027If that is so, you would be forced to remain on a spaceship in close quarters with several other crewpeople for over two years. Do you think you can endure that? You know very well that small ships have never made long trips. What we need is a Settlement, a structure large enough to provide a reasonable environment - like Rotor. How long will that take?\u0027 \u0027I couldn\u0027t say, Director.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps ten years if all works well - if there are no hitches or mishaps. Remember, we haven\u0027t built a Settlement in nearly a century. All the recent Settlements have been built by other Settlements. If, suddenly, we begin building one, we will attract the attention of all the Settlements that already exist, and that must be avoided. Then, too, if such a Settlement can be built, and outfitted with hyper-assistance, and sent to the Neighbor Star in over a two-year flight, what will it do when it gets there? As a Settlement, it will be vulnerable and easy to destroy if Rotor has warships, as it certainly will have. Rotor will have more warships than we could possibly carry on our traveling Settlement. After all, they have been there for three years already, and may be there for twelve more years before we get there. They will blow our Settlement out of space on sight.\u0027 \u0027In that case, Director-\u0027 \u0027No further guessing, Agent Fisher. In that case, we must have true hyperspatial travel, so that we may move any distance we like in as short a period as we like.\u0027 \u0027Pardon me, Director, but is that possible? Even in theory?\u0027 \u0027That is not for you or me to say. We need scientists to concentrate on the matter, and we don\u0027t have them. For a century or more, Earth has suffered a brain drain to the Settlements. So now we must reverse that. We must raid the Settlements, after a fashion, and persuade the best physicists and engineers to come to Earth. We can offer them a great deal, but it will have to be done carefully. We can\u0027t be too open, you understand, or the Settlements will certainly forestall us. Now-\u0027 He paused, and studied Fisher thoughtfully. Fisher stirred uneasily and said, \u0027Yes, Director?\u0027 \u0027The physicist I have my eye on is one T.A. Wendel, who, I\u0027m told, is the best hyperspatialist in the Solar System-\u0027 \u0027It was the hyperspatialists on Rotor who discovered hyper-assistance.\u0027 Fisher could not resist allowing a certain dryness to enter his voice. Tanayama ignored that. He said, \u0027Discoveries can be made by happy accident, and an inferior mind can stumble ahead while a superior one is taking the time to lay a firm foundation. That has frequently happened in history. Besides, Rotor only has what proved, in the end, to be merely hyper-assistance, a speed-of-light drive. I want a superluminal drive, one that is far beyond the speed of light. And I want Wendel.\u0027 \u0027And do you wish me to get him for you?\u0027 \u0027Her. She\u0027s a woman. Tessa Anita Wendel of Adelia.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 \u0027That is why we want you for the job. Apparently\u0027 - and here Tanayama seemed to radiate a quiet amusement, although nothing in his facial expression seemed to indicate that - \u0027you are irresistible to women.\u0027 Fisher\u0027s expression grew wooden. \u0027I ask pardon for contradicting you, Director, but I do not find it so. I have never found it so.\u0027 \u0027The reports are persuasive, just the same. Wendel is a middle-aged woman, in her forties, twice-divorced. She should not be hard to persuade.\u0027 \u0027To be honest, sir, I find the assignment distasteful and, under those circumstances, it is possible another agent would be better suited for the task.\u0027 \u0027But I want you just the same. If you fear that you would not be your flirtatious and maddeningly attractive self if you approached her with face averted and nose wrinkled, I will sweeten matters for you, Agent Fisher. You failed on Rotor, but your service since has, in part, made up for it. You can now completely make up for it. If, however, you do not bring back this woman, that will be a far greater failure than Rotor was, and you will never have the chance to make up for that. Still, I don\u0027t want you governed by apprehension alone. I will throw in a bit of anticipation. Bring back Wendel and when a superluminal vessel is built and heads out toward the Neighbor Star, you will be on it if you wish.\u0027 \u0027I will do my best,\u0027 said Fisher, \u0027and I would have done my best even if there were no occasion for either apprehension or anticipation.\u0027 \u0027An excellent answer,\u0027 said Tanayama, allowing himself the thinnest of smiles, \u0027and undoubtedly well rehearsed.\u0027 And Fisher left, fully realizing that he had been sent out on his most crucial fishing expedition yet.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-15.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
