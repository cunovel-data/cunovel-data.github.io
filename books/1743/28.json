{"id":70509,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"59 Siever Genarr opened his eyes slowly and blinked at the light. He had a little trouble focusing at first and couldn\u0027t quite make out whatever filled his vision. The image sharpened slowly and soon Genarr recognized Ranay D\u0027Aubisson, Chief Neurophysicist of the Dome. Genarr said in a weak voice, \u0027Marlene?\u0027 D\u0027Aubisson looked grim. \u0027She seems well. It\u0027s you I\u0027m concerned about right now.\u0027 A pang of apprehension made its way through Genarr\u0027s vitals and he tried to drown it with his sense of black humor. He said, \u0027I must be worse off than I thought if the Angel of the Plague is here.\u0027 Then, as D\u0027Aubisson said nothing, Genarr asked sharply, \u0027Am I?\u0027 She seemed to come to life. Tall and angular, she bent over him, the fine wrinkles about her piercing blue eyes becoming more prominent as she squinted at him. \u0027How do you feel?\u0027 she asked, answering no questions. \u0027Tired. Very tired. All right, otherwise. I think?\u0027 The rising inflection served to repeat his earlier question. She said, \u0027You\u0027ve been sleeping for five hours.\u0027 She was still not answering. Genarr groaned. \u0027I\u0027m tired anyway. And I have to go to the bathroom.\u0027 He began to struggle into a sitting position. At D\u0027Aubisson\u0027s signal a young man approached rapidly. Respectfully, he placed his hand under Genarr\u0027s elbow and was indignantly shaken off. D\u0027Aubisson said, \u0027Please let yourself be helped. We have made no diagnosis yet.\u0027 When Genarr was back in bed ten minutes later, he said ruefully, \u0027No diagnosis. Have you made a brain scan?\u0027 \u0027Yes, of course. Instantly.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 She shrugged. \u0027We found nothing of importance, but you were asleep. We will take another when you\u0027re awake. And you must be observed in other ways.\u0027 \u0027Why? Isn\u0027t the brain scan enough?\u0027 Her gray eyebrows rose. \u0027Do you think it is?\u0027 \u0027No games. What are you getting at? Say it straight out. I\u0027m not a child.\u0027 D\u0027Aubisson sighed. \u0027The cases of the Plague we have had showed interesting features on brain scan, but we were never able to compare it with the pre-Plague standard because none of the sufferers had been scanned prior to onset. By the time we set up a routine and universal brain scanning program for all people in the Dome, there were no longer any unmistakable cases of the Plague. Did you know this?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t lay traps for me,\u0027 said Genarr pettishly. \u0027Of course I knew of it. Do you think my memory is gone? I deduce, then - I can still deduce, too, you know - that although you have my scan of earlier days and can compare it with the scan you just took, you found nothing of significance. Is that it?\u0027 \u0027You obviously do not have anything remarkably wrong, but we might have something we would consider a subclinical situation.\u0027 \u0027If you find nothing?\u0027 \u0027We might not notice a subtle change if we\u0027re not specifically looking for it. After all, you collapsed and you are not ordinarily given to collapsing, Commander.\u0027 \u0027Take another scan now that I\u0027m awake, then, and if it\u0027s something so subtle it escapes you, then I\u0027ll live with it. But tell me about Marlene. Are you sure she\u0027s well?\u0027 \u0027I said she seems well, Commander. Unlike you, she showed no abnormality of behavior. She did not collapse.\u0027 \u0027And is she safely inside the Dome?\u0027 \u0027Yes, she brought you in herself, just before you fell unconscious. Don\u0027t you remember?\u0027 Genarr flushed, and mumbled something. D\u0027Aubisson\u0027s look grew sardonic. \u0027Suppose you tell us exactly what do you remember, Commander. Tell us everything. Any of it may be important.\u0027 Genarr\u0027s discomfort increased as he tried to remember. It seemed a long time ago and the edges were blurred, very much as though it were a dream he was trying to recall. \u0027Marlene was taking off her E-suit.\u0027 Then, weakly, \u0027Wasn\u0027t she?\u0027 \u0027Quite. She came in without it and we had to send someone out there to retrieve it.\u0027 \u0027Well, I tried to stop her, of course, when I noticed what she was doing. Dr Insigna called out, I remember, and that alerted me. Marlene was a distance away from me, by the stream. I tried to call out, but, in the shock of the situation I couldn\u0027t manage to make a sound just at first. I tried to get to her quickly, to - to-\u0027 \u0027Run to her,\u0027 put in D\u0027Aubisson. \u0027Yes, but - but-\u0027 \u0027But you found you couldn\u0027t run. You were almost in a state of paralysis. Am I correct?\u0027 Genarr nodded. \u0027Yes. Rather. I tried to run, but - did you ever have one of those nightmares when you are pursued and somehow you can\u0027t manage to make yourself run?\u0027 \u0027Yes. We all have those. It usually comes when we have managed to tangle our arms or legs in the bedclothes.\u0027 \u0027It felt like a dream. I managed to get my voice, at last, and shouted at her, but without the E-suit, she couldn\u0027t hear me, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 \u0027Did you feel faint?\u0027 \u0027Not really. Just helpless and confused. As though it were not even any use in trying to run. Then Marlene saw me and ran toward me. She must somehow have recognized I was in trouble.\u0027 \u0027She didn\u0027t seem to have any trouble running. Is that right?\u0027 \u0027I wasn\u0027t aware that she was. She seemed to reach me. Then we- I\u0027ll be honest, Ranay. I don\u0027t remember after that.\u0027 \u0027You came into the Dome together,\u0027 said D\u0027Aubisson calmly. \u0027She was helping you, holding you up. And once in the Dome, you collapsed and now - here you are.\u0027 \u0027And you think I have the Plague.\u0027 \u0027I think you experienced something abnormal, but I can find nothing in your brain scan, and I am puzzled. There you have it.\u0027 \u0027It was the shock of seeing Marlene in danger. Why should she be taking off her E-suit if she weren\u0027t-\u0027 He stopped abruptly. \u0027If she weren\u0027t succumbing to the Plague. Is that it?\u0027 \u0027The thought crossed my mind.\u0027 \u0027But she seems fine. Would you like to sleep some more?\u0027 \u0027No. I\u0027m awake. Take another brain scan and see to it that it comes out negative because I feel much better now that I have the story off my chest. And then I\u0027m going about my business, you harpy.\u0027 \u0027Even if the brain scan is apparently normal, Commander, you\u0027ll stay in bed for at least twenty-four hours. For observation, you understand.\u0027 Genarr groaned theatrically. \u0027You can\u0027t do that. I can\u0027t lie here and stare at the ceiling for twenty-four hours.\u0027 \u0027You won\u0027t have to. We can set up a viewing stand for you, so that you can read a book or enjoy holovision. You can even have a visitor or two.\u0027 \u0027I suppose the visitors will be observing me, too.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s conceivable they may be questioned on the matter. And now we\u0027ll set up the brain scan equipment again.\u0027 She turned away, then turned back with a smile that softened slightly at the edges. \u0027It\u0027s very possible you\u0027re all right, Commander. Your reactions seem normal to me. But we must be sure, mustn\u0027t we?\u0027 Genarr grunted, and when D\u0027Aubisson turned again and walked away, he made a face at her straight back. That, he decided, was a normal reaction, too. 60 When Genarr opened his eyes again, it was to see Eugenia Insigna gazing at him sadly. He looked surprised and began to sit up. \u0027Eugenia!\u0027 She smiled at him, but that did not make her face look less sad. She said, \u0027They said I could come in, Siever. They said you were all right.\u0027 Genarr felt a wave of relief. He knew he was all right, but it was nice to hear that his opinion was confirmed. He said with bravado, \u0027Of course I am. Brain scan normal, asleep. Brain scan normal, awake. Brain scan normal, for ever. But how\u0027s Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Her brain scan is perfectly normal, too.\u0027 Even that did not lighten her mood. \u0027As you see,\u0027 said Genarr, \u0027I was Marlene\u0027s canary, as I had promised. I was affected by whatever it was before she was.\u0027 And then his mood changed. It was no time for banter. He said, \u0027Eugenia, how can I excuse myself to you? I wasn\u0027t watching Marlene to begin with, and I was too paralyzed with horror to do anything afterward. I failed completely, and did so after telling you with such confidence that I would take care of her. Honestly, I have no excuse.\u0027 Insigna was shaking her head. \u0027No, Siever. It was in no way your fault. I\u0027m so glad she brought you in.\u0027 \u0027Not my fault?\u0027 Genarr felt dumbfounded. Of course it was his fault. \u0027Not at all. There\u0027s something much worse than Marlene foolishly removing her suit, or you being unable to act quickly. Much worse. I\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 Genarr felt himself turning cold. What\u0027s much worse? he thought. \u0027What are you trying to tell me?\u0027 He swung himself out of bed and suddenly became aware of his bare legs and of the totally inadequate gown he was wearing. He hastily draped the light blanket around himself. He said, \u0027Please sit down and tell me. Is Marlene all right? Are you hiding something about her?\u0027 Insigna sat down and looked solemnly at Genarr. \u0027They say she\u0027s all right. The brain scan is entirely norm al. Those who know about the Plague say she shows no symptoms.\u0027 \u0027Well then, why are you sitting there as though it\u0027s the end of the world?\u0027 \u0027I think it is, Siever. Of this one.\u0027 \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t explain. I can\u0027t reason it out. You have to talk to Marlene to understand. She\u0027s going her own way, Siever. She\u0027s not upset over what she did. She insists that she cannot properly explore Erythro - experience Erythro is the phrase she uses - with the E-suit on and she has no intention of wearing one any longer.\u0027 \u0027In that case, she won\u0027t go out.\u0027 \u0027Oh, but Marlene says she will. Quite confidently. Whenever she wishes, she says. And alone. She blames herself for having let you come with her. She\u0027s not callous over what happened to you, you see. Over that, she is upset. And she was glad she reached you in time. Really, there were tears in her eyes when she talked about what might have happened if she hadn\u0027t walked you into the Dome in time.\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t that make her feel insecure?\u0027 \u0027No. That\u0027s the oddest part of it. She\u0027s now sure that you were in danger, that anyone would have been in danger. But not she. She is so positive, Siever, I could-\u0027 She shook her head, then muttered, \u0027I don\u0027t know what to do.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s a positive girl by nature, Eugenia. You must know that better than I do.\u0027 \u0027Not this positive. It\u0027s as though she knows we can\u0027t stop her.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps we can. I\u0027ll talk to her and if she pulls any of this \"You can\u0027t stop me,\" when she talks to me, I\u0027ll just send her back to Rotor - and at once. I was on her side, but after what happened to me outside the Dome, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to be tough.\u0027 \u0027But you won\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Why not? Because of Pitt?\u0027 \u0027No. I mean you just won\u0027t.\u0027 Genarr stared at her, then laughed uneasily. \u0027Oh come, I\u0027m not that much under her spell. I may feel like a kindly uncle, Eugenia, but I\u0027m not so kindly I\u0027ll let her walk into danger. There are limits, and you\u0027ll find that I know how to set them.\u0027 He paused, and said ruefully, \u0027We seem to have changed sides, you and I. Before today it was you who insisted on stopping her and I who said it couldn\u0027t be done. Now it\u0027s the other way around.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s because the incident outside has frightened you, and the experience since then has frightened me.\u0027 \u0027What experience since then, Eugenia?\u0027 \u0027I tried to set the limits, after she was back in the Dome. I said to her, \"Young lady, don\u0027t you dare speak to me like that or, far from not being able to leave the Dome, you won\u0027t be able to leave your room. You\u0027ll be locked in, tied up if necessary, and back to Rotor we\u0027ll go on the first rocket.\" You see, I was wild enough to threaten her all the way.\u0027 \u0027Well, what did she do? I\u0027m willing to bet a large sum she didn\u0027t burst into tears. I suspect she gritted her teeth and defied you. Right?\u0027 \u0027No. I hadn\u0027t even gotten half the words out when my teeth started chattering and I couldn\u0027t speak. A wave of nausea swept over me.\u0027 Genarr said, frowning, \u0027Are you about to tell me that you think Marlene has some strange hypnotic power that can prevent us from opposing her? Surely that\u0027s impossible. Have you ever noticed anything like that in her before this?\u0027 \u0027No, of course I haven\u0027t. I don\u0027t even see this in her now. She has nothing to do with it. I must have looked quite ill at the moment I was threatening her and that clearly frightened her. She was very concerned. She couldn\u0027t possibly have caused it and then reacted so. And when you two were outside the Dome and she was taking off her E-suit, she wasn\u0027t even looking at you. She had her back to you. I was watching and I know that. Yet you found you couldn\u0027t do anything to interfere with her and when she realized you were in trouble, she flew to your assistance. She couldn\u0027t have deliberately done that to you and reacted in that fashion.\u0027 \u0027But then-\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not through. After I had threatened her, or, rather, after I had failed to threaten her, I scarcely dared say anything to her that wasn\u0027t perfectly superficial, but you can be sure I kept my eye on her and tried not to let her see I was doing that. At one point, she talked to one of your guards - you have them all over the place.\u0027 \u0027In theory,\u0027 muttered Genarr, \u0027the Dome is a military post. The guards merely maintain order, help out when needed-\u0027 \u0027Yes, I dare say,\u0027 said Insigna with a touch of contempt. \u0027That\u0027s Janus Pitt making sure he has a way of keeping you all under observation and under control, but never mind. Marlene and the guard talked for quite a while, seemed to be arguing. I went to the guard afterward, after Marlene was gone, and asked him what Marlene had talked to him about. He was reluctant to say, but I squeezed it out of him. He said she wanted to arrange some sort of pass that would allow her to leave and re-enter the Dome freely. \u0027I said to him, \"What did you tell her?\" \u0027He said, \"I told her that would have to be arranged at the Commander\u0027s office, but that I would try to help her.\" \u0027I was indignant. \"What do you mean you would help her?\" I said. \"How could you offer to do that?\" \u0027He said, \"I had to do something, ma\u0027am. Every time I tried to tell her it couldn\u0027t be done, I felt sick.\" \u0027 Genarr listened to all of this stonily. \u0027Are you telling me that this is something Marlene does unconsciously, that anyone who dares contradict her is made ill, and that she doesn\u0027t even know that she is responsible for it?\u0027 \u0027No, of course not. I don\u0027t see how she can be doing anything at all. If this were an unconscious ability of hers, it would have made its appearance on Rotor, and it never happened there. And it isn\u0027t just any contradiction. She tried for a second helping of dessert at dinner last night, and quite forgetting that I didn\u0027t dare cross her, I said sharply, \"No, Marlene.\" She looked terribly rebellious, but subsided, and I felt in perfect health, I can tell you. No, I think it\u0027s only in connection with Erythro that one can\u0027t contradict her.\u0027 \u0027But why do you suppose that should be, Eugenia? You seem to have some notion or other about this. If I were Marlene, I would read you like a book and tell you what that notion is, but since I am not, you must tell me.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s Marlene at all who\u0027s doing this. It\u0027s - it\u0027s the planet itself.\u0027 \u0027The planet!\u0027 \u0027Yes, Erythro! The planet. It\u0027s controlling Marlene. Why else should she be so confident that she is immune to the Plague, and that she will come to no harm? It controls the rest of us, too. You came to harm when you tried to stop her. I did. The guard did. Many people came to harm in the early days of the Dome because the planet felt it was being invaded, so it produced the Plague. Then, when it seemed you were all content to remain within the Dome, it let go, and the Plague stopped. See how it all fits in?\u0027 \u0027Do you think, then, that the planet wants Marlene out upon its surface?\u0027 \u0027Apparently.\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t pretend to understand it. I\u0027m just telling you how it must be.\u0027 Genarr\u0027s voice softened. \u0027Eugenia, surely you know that the planet can\u0027t do anything. It\u0027s a lump of rock and metal. You\u0027re being mystical.\u0027 \u0027I am not. Siever, don\u0027t slip into this trick of pretending that I\u0027m a silly woman. I\u0027m a first-class scientist and there\u0027s nothing mystical about my thinking. When I say the planet, I don\u0027t mean the rock and metal. I mean that there\u0027s some powerful permeating life-form upon the planet.\u0027 \u0027It would have to be invisible, then. This is a barren world with no sign of life above the prokaryote, let alone intelligence.\u0027 \u0027What do you know about this barren world, as you call it? Has it been properly explored? Has it been searched through and through?\u0027 Slowly, Genarr shook his head. He said with a pleading note in his voice, \u0027Eugenia, you\u0027re drifting off into hysteria.\u0027 \u0027Am I, Siever? Think it out yourself and tell me if you can find an alternate explanation. I tell you the life on the planet - whatever it is - will not have us. We\u0027re doomed. And what it wants with Marlene\u0027 - her voice quavered -\u0027I can\u0027t imagine.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-28.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
