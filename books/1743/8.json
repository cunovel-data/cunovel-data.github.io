She was careful to keep her expression flat and meaningless, but within herself she was both pleased and surprised. Her mother was finally telling her of the events involving her father and Commissioner Pitt. She was being treated as a grown-up.\n Marlene said, \u0027I would have checked Nemesis\u0027 motions regardless of what Commissioner Pitt said, Mother, but I see you didn\u0027t. Your guilt makes it plain.\u0027\n Insigna said, \u0027I can\u0027t get used to the notion that I wear my guilt like a label on my forehead.\u0027\n \u0027No-one hides their feelings,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027If you really watch, you can always tell.\u0027\n (Others couldn\u0027t. Marlene had learned that only slowly, and with difficulty. People just didn\u0027t look, they didn\u0027t sense, they didn\u0027t care. They didn\u0027t watch faces, and bodies, and sounds, and attitudes, and little nervous habits.)\n \u0027You shouldn\u0027t really watch like that, Marlene,\u0027 said Insigna, as though their thoughts had taken parallel paths. She put her arm around the girl\u0027s shoulder to prevent her words from sounding like a scolding. \u0027People get nervous when those large dark eyes of yours fix on them soulfully. Respect people\u0027s privacy.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Mother,\u0027 said Marlene, noting without effort that her mother was trying to protect herself. She was nervous about herself, wondering how much she gave away at each moment.\n Then Marlene said, \u0027How is it that despite all your guilty feelings about the Solar System, you did nothing?\u0027\n \u0027A number of reasons, Molly.\u0027\n (Not \u0027Molly,\u0027 thought Marlene with anguish. Marlene! Marlene! Marlene! Three syllables. Accent on the second. Grown up!)\n \u0027Like what reasons?\u0027 asked Marlene sulkily. (Couldn\u0027t her mother detect the wave of hostility that swept over Marlene each time a kid name was used? Surely it twisted her face, smoldered her eyes, convulsed her lips. Why didn\u0027t people notice? Why didn\u0027t people look?)\n \u0027For one thing, Janus Pitt was very convincing. However odd the points he makes, however hostile you feel toward them at the time, he always makes you see that he has good reasons for his viewpoints.\u0027\n \u0027If that\u0027s true, Mother, he\u0027s awfully dangerous.\u0027\n Insigna seemed to break away from her thoughts to glance curiously at her daughter. \u0027Why do you say that?\u0027\n \u0027Every point of view can have good reasons behind it. If someone can seize those reasons quickly, and present them convincingly, he can argue anyone into anything, and that\u0027s dangerous.\u0027\n \u0027Janus Pitt has those abilities, I\u0027ll admit. I\u0027m surprised you understand these things.\u0027\n (Marlene thought: Because I\u0027m only fifteen, and you\u0027re used to thinking I\u0027m a child.)\n Aloud, she said, \u0027You learn a lot watching people.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but remember what I told you. Control the watching.\u0027\n (Never.) \u0027So Mr Pitt persuaded you.\u0027\n \u0027He made me see there\u0027d be no harm in waiting awhile.\u0027\n \u0027And you weren\u0027t even curious to study Nemesis and see exactly where it was going? You would have to be.\u0027\n \u0027I was, but it\u0027s not as easy as you think. The Observatory is in constant use. You have to wait your turn to use the instruments. Even if I\u0027m the head, I can\u0027t use them freely. Then, too, when someone does use them, there no secret about it. We know what it\u0027s being used for and why. There was very little chance I would be able to develop a really detailed spectrum of Nemesis and of the Sun, or to use the Observatory computer on the necessary calculations, without people knowing at once what I was doing. I suspect that Pitt had a few people in the Observatory watching me, too. If I had stepped out of line, he would have known at once.\u0027\n \u0027He couldn\u0027t do anything to you about it, could he?\u0027\n \u0027He couldn\u0027t have me shot for treason if that\u0027s what you mean - not that he\u0027d dream of doing such a thing - but he could relieve me of my Observatory duties and put me to work in the farms. I wouldn\u0027t want that. It wasn\u0027t long after I\u0027d had that little talk with Pitt that we discovered that Nemesis had a planet - or a companion star. To this day, we\u0027re not sure what to call it. They were only separated by a distance of four million kilometers and the companion object didn\u0027t radiate in visible light at all.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re talking about Megas, aren\u0027t you, Mother?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I am. It\u0027s an old word meaning \"big\" and, for a planet, it\u0027s very big, considerably bigger than the Solar System\u0027s largest planet, Jupiter. But it\u0027s very small for a star. Some think of Megas as a brown dwarf.\u0027 She broke off and eyed her daughter narrowly, as though suddenly uncertain as to her capacity to absorb matters. \u0027Do you know what a brown dwarf is, Molly?\u0027\n \u0027Marlene is my name, Mother.\u0027\n Insigna flushed slightly. \u0027Yes. I\u0027m sorry if I forget now and then. I can\u0027t help it, you know. I had a very dear little girl once whose name was Molly.\u0027\n \u0027I know. And next time I\u0027m six, you can call me Molly all you want.\u0027\n Insigna laughed. \u0027Do you know what a brown dwarf is, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I do, Mother. A brown dwarf is a small starlike body, with too little mass to develop the temperatures and pressures to bring about hydrogen fusion in its interior, but enough mass to bring about secondary reactions that keep it warm.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. Not bad. Megas is on the borderline. It\u0027s either a very warm planet or a very dim brown dwarf. It gives off no visible light, but emits richly in the infrared. It\u0027s not quite like anything we\u0027ve ever studied. It was the first extrasolar planetary body - that is, the first planet outside the Solar System - that we have been able to study in detail, and the Observatory was totally immersed in it. I wouldn\u0027t have had a chance to work on Nemesis\u0027 motion even if I had wanted to, and, to tell you the truth, I forgot about it for a time. I was as interested in Megas as everyone else was, you see?\u0027\n \u0027Um,\u0027 said Marlene.\n \u0027It turned out it was the only sizable planetary body circling Nemesis, but it was enough. It was five times the mass-\u0027\n \u0027I know, Mother. It\u0027s five times the mass of Jupiter, and one thirtieth the mass of Nemesis. The computer taught me that long ago.\u0027\n \u0027Of course, dear. And it\u0027s no more habitable than Jupiter is; less, if anything. That was disappointing at first, even though we didn\u0027t really expect to find a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star. If a planet were close enough to a star like Nemesis to keep water liquid, tidal influences would force it to face one side to Nemesis at all times.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t that what Megas does, Mother? I mean, one side always faces Nemesis?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it does. That means it has a warm side and cold side, with the warm side quite warm. It would be at red heat, if it weren\u0027t that the circulation of its dense atmosphere tends to equalize temperatures somewhat. Because of this and because of Megas\u0027 own inner warmth even the cold side is quite warm. There are many things about Megas that were unique in astronomical experience. And then we discovered that Megas had satellite or, if you want to consider Megas a very small star, it had a planet - Erythro.\u0027\n \u0027Which Rotor orbits, I know. But, Mother, it\u0027s been over eleven years since there was all that fuss about Megas and Erythro. In all that time, haven\u0027t you managed to sneak a look at the spectra of Nemesis and the Sun? Haven\u0027t you done a little figuring?\u0027\n \u0027Well-\u0027\n Marlene said hastily, \u0027I know you have.\u0027\n \u0027By my expression?\u0027\n \u0027By everything about you.\u0027\n \u0027You can be a very uncomfortable person to have around, Marlene. Yes, I have.\u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it\u0027s heading for the Solar System.\u0027\n There was a pause. Then Marlene said in a low voice. \u0027Is it going to hit?\u0027\n \u0027No, as far as my figures are concerned. I\u0027m quite sure it\u0027s not going to hit the Sun, or the Earth, or any significant part of the Solar System, for that matter. But it doesn\u0027t have to, you see. Even if it misses, it will probably destroy the Earth.\u0027\n 14\n It was quite clear to Marlene that her mother did not like to talk about Earth\u0027s destruction, that there was internal friction inhibiting her discourse, that if she were left to herself, she would stop talking. Her expression - the way she pulled away a little from Marlene, as though anxious to leave; the way she licked her lips very delicately, as though she were trying to remove the taste of her words - was clarity itself to Marlene.\n But she did not want her mother to stop. She had to know more.\n She said gently, \u0027If Nemesis misses, how will it destroy the Earth?\u0027\n \u0027Let me try to explain. The Earth goes around the Sun, just as Rotor goes around Erythro. If all there were in the Solar System were the Earth and the Sun, then the Earth would go around in the same path almost eternally. I say \"almost\" because, as it turns, it radiates gravitational waves that bleed the Earth\u0027s momentum, and that causes it very, very slowly to spin into the Sun, We can ignore that.\n \u0027There are other complicating factors because Earth isn\u0027t alone. The Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, every object in the neighborhood pulls at it. The pulls are very minor compared to that of the Sun, so Earth remains in its orbit more or less. However, the minor pulls, which are shifting in direction and intensity in a complicated way, as the various objects themselves move, introduce minor changes in Earth\u0027s orbit. Earth moves in and out slightly, its axial tilt veers and changes its slant a bit, the eccentricity alters somewhat, and so on.\n \u0027It can be shown - it has been shown - that all these minor changes are cyclic. They don\u0027t progress in one direction, but move back and forth. What it amounts to is that the Earth, in its orbit about the Sun, quivers slightly in a dozen different ways. All the bodies in the Solar System quiver in this way. Earth\u0027s quiver doesn\u0027t prevent it from supporting life. At the worst, it may get an ice age or an ice disappearance and a rise and fall in sea level, but life has survived everything for well over three billion years.\n \u0027But now let us suppose Nemesis dashes by and misses, that it doesn\u0027t approach closer than a light-month or so. That would be less than a trillion kilometers. As it passes - and it would take a number of years to pass - it would give a gravitational push to the system. It would make the quivering worse, but then, when it was gone, the quivers would settle down again.\u0027\n Marlene said, \u0027You look as though you think it would be a lot worse than you make it sound. What\u0027s so bad about Nemesis giving the Solar System a little extra quiver - if it all settles down again afterward?\u0027\n \u0027Well, will it settle down again in quite the same place? That\u0027s the problem. If Earth\u0027s equilibrium position is a little different - a little farther from the Sun, a little nearer, if its orbit is a little more eccentric or its axis a little more tilted, or less - how will that affect Earth\u0027s climate? Even a small change might make it an uninhabitable world.\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t you calculate it out in advance?\u0027\n \u0027No. Rotor isn\u0027t a good place to calculate from. It quivers, too, and a great deal. It would take considerable time and considerable calculation to deduce from my observations here exactly what path Nemesis is taking - and we just won\u0027t be sure till it gets considerably closer to the Solar System, long after I am dead.\u0027\n \u0027So you can\u0027t tell exactly just how closely Nemesis will pass the Solar System.\u0027\n \u0027It is almost impossible to calculate. The gravitational field of every nearby star within a dozen light-years has to be taken into account. After all, the tiniest uncalculated effect may build up to such a deviation in over two light-years as to make a passage that is calculated as a near-hit come out, actually, to be a total miss. Or vice versa.\u0027\n \u0027Commissioner Pitt said everyone in the Solar System will be able to leave if they want to by the time Nemesis arrives. Is he right?\u0027\n \u0027He might be. But how can one tell what will happen in five thousand years? What historical twists will take place and how that will affect matters. We can hope everyone will get off safely.\u0027\n \u0027Even if they\u0027re not warned,\u0027 said Marlene, feeling rather diffident at pointing out an astronomical truism to her mother, \u0027they\u0027ll find out for themselves. They\u0027ve got to. Nemesis will come closer and closer and it will be unmistakable after a while and they can calculate its path much more accurately as it comes closer.\u0027\n \u0027But they will have that much less time to make their escape - if one is necessary.\u0027\n Marlene stared at her toes. She said, \u0027Mother, don\u0027t be angry with me. It seems to me as though you\u0027d be unhappy even if everyone got away from the Solar System safely. Something else is wrong. Please tell me.\u0027\n Insigna said, \u0027I don\u0027t like the thought of everyone leaving Earth. Even if it is done in orderly fashion, with plenty of time and with no casualties to speak of, I still don\u0027t like the thought. I don\u0027t want Earth to be abandoned.\u0027\n \u0027Suppose it must be.\u0027\n \u0027Then it will be. I can bow to the inevitable, but I don\u0027t have to like it.\u0027\n \u0027Are you sentimental about Earth? You studied there, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I did my graduate work in astronomy there. I didn\u0027t like Earth, but that doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s the place where human beings originated. Do you know what I mean, Marlene? Even if I didn\u0027t think much of it when I was there, it\u0027s still the world where life developed over the eons. To me it\u0027s not only a world but an idea, an abstraction. I want it to exist for the sake of the past. I don\u0027t know if I can make that clear.\u0027\n Marlene said, \u0027Father was an Earthman.\u0027\n Insigna\u0027s lips tightened a bit. \u0027Yes, he was.\u0027\n \u0027And he went back to Earth.\u0027\n \u0027The records say he did. I suppose he did.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m half an Earthperson, then. Isn\u0027t that so?\u0027\n Insigna frowned. \u0027We\u0027re all Earthpeople, Marlene. My great-great grandparents lived on Earth all their lives. My great-grandmother was born on Earth. Everyone, without exception, is descended from Earthpeople. And not just human beings. Every speck of life on every Settlement, from a virus to a tree, is descended from Earth life.\u0027\n Marlene said, \u0027But only human beings know it. And some are closer than others. Do you think about Father, sometimes, even now?\u0027 Marlene looked up briefly at her mother\u0027s face and winced. \u0027It\u0027s none of my business. That\u0027s what you\u0027re going to tell me.\u0027\n That\u0027s the feeling I just had, but I don\u0027t have to be guided by my feelings. After all, you\u0027re his daughter. Yes, I think about him now and then.\u0027 She shrugged her shoulders slightly.\n Insigna said, \u0027Do you think about him, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027I have nothing to think of. I don\u0027t remember him. I\u0027ve never seen any holograms, or anything.\u0027\n \u0027No, there was no point in-\u0027 Her voice trailed off.\n \u0027But when I was littler, I used to wonder why some fathers stayed with their children when the Leaving happened, and some fathers didn\u0027t. I thought that maybe the ones who left didn\u0027t like their children, and that Father didn\u0027t like me.\u0027\n Insigna stared at her daughter. \u0027You never told me that.\u0027\n \u0027It was a private thought when I was little. When I got older, I knew that it was more complicated than that.\u0027\n \u0027You should never have had to think so. It\u0027s not true. I would have assured you of that, if I had had the slightest idea-\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t like to talk about those times, Mother. I understand.\u0027\n \u0027I would have anyway, if I had known about that thought of yours; if I could read your face as you read mine. He did love you. He would have taken you with him if I had allowed it. It\u0027s my fault, really, that you two are separated.\u0027\n \u0027His, too. He might have stayed with us.\u0027\n \u0027Well, he might have, but now that the years have passed, I can see and understand his problems a little better than I could then. After all, I wasn\u0027t leaving home; my world was coming with me. I may be over two light-years from Earth, but I\u0027m still at home on Rotor where I was born. Your father was different. He was born on Earth and not on Rotor, and I suppose he couldn\u0027t bear the thought of leaving Earth altogether, and for ever. I think about that now and then, also. I hate the thought of Earth being deserted. There must be several billion people there whose hearts would break to leave it.\u0027\n There was silence between them for a moment, then Marlene said, \u0027I wonder what Father is doing back on Earth right now.\u0027\n \u0027How can we possibly tell, Marlene? Twenty trillion kilometers is a long, long way, and fourteen years is a long, long time.\u0027\n \u0027Do you suppose he\u0027s still alive?\u0027\n \u0027We can\u0027t even know that,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027Life can be very short on Earth.\u0027 Then, as though suddenly aware she wasn\u0027t talking to herself, she said, \u0027I\u0027m sure he\u0027s alive, Marlene. He was in excellent health when he left, and he\u0027s only just approaching fifty now.\u0027 Then softly, \u0027Do you miss him, Marlene?\u0027\n Marlene shook her head. \u0027You can\u0027t miss what you\u0027ve never had.\u0027\n (But you had him, Mother, she thought. And you miss him.) \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-8.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
