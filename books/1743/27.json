{"id":70508,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"58 Crile Fisher had seen Igor Koropatsky only twice in the three years since he had assumed the post formerly held by Tanayama, and had become the actual - if not the titular - head of the project. He had no trouble recognizing him, however, when the photo-entry had signaled his image. Koropatsky was still his portly, outwardly genial self. He was dressed well, with a large and flufly cravat in the latest style. As for Fisher, he had been relaxing through the morning and was scarcely presentable, but one did not refuse to receive Koropatsky, even when he came without warning. Fisher signaled the tactful \u0027Hold\u0027 image, the cartoon figure of a welcoming host (or hostess, for the sex was made conventionally ambiguous) with a hand upraised delicately in a gesture that was universally understood to mean \u0027Just a minute\u0027 without the crassness of actually saying so. Fisher had a few moments to comb his hair and adjust his clothes. He might have shaved, but he felt that Koropatsky would consider any further delay insulting. The door slid aside and Koropatsky walked in. He smiled pleasantly and said, \u0027Good morning, Fisher. I intrude upon you, I know.\u0027 \u0027No intrusion, Director,\u0027 said Fisher, making an effort to sound sincere, \u0027but if you wish to see Dr Wendel, she is, I\u0027m afraid, at the ship.\u0027 Koropatsky grunted. \u0027You know, I rather thought she might be. I have no choice, then, but to talk to you. May I sit down?\u0027 \u0027Yes, of course, Director,\u0027 said Fisher, chagrined at not having offered Koropatsky a seat before the request was made. \u0027Would you care for refreshment?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 Koropatsky patted his abdomen. \u0027I weigh myself every morning and that alone is sufficient to cost me my appetite - almost. Fisher, I have never had a chance to talk to you, man to man. I have wanted to.\u0027 \u0027It is my pleasure, Director,\u0027 mumbled Fisher, beginning to grow uneasy. What was this all about? \u0027Our planet is in debt to you.\u0027 \u0027If you say so, Director,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027You were on Rotor before it left.\u0027 \u0027That was fourteen years ago, Director.\u0027 \u0027I know it was. You were married on Rotor and had a child.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director,\u0027 said Fisher in a low voice. \u0027But you returned to Earth just before Rotor left the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director.\u0027 \u0027It was from something that was said to you - and that you repeated here - plus another suggestion you made that led to Earth\u0027s discovery of the Neighbor Star.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director.\u0027 \u0027And it was you who brought Dr Tessa Wendel from Adelia to Earth.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director.\u0027 \u0027And you have made it possible for her to work here for over eight years, and kept her happy, eh?\u0027 He chuckled deeply and Fisher felt that had Koropatsky been closer he would have dug his elbow into Fisher\u0027s side in a man-to-man fashion. Fisher said cautiously, \u0027We get along well, Director.\u0027 \u0027But you have never married.\u0027 \u0027I am already married, Director.\u0027 \u0027And separated fourteen years. A divorce could be quickly arranged.\u0027 \u0027I also have a daughter.\u0027 \u0027Who would remain your daughter, even if you married again.\u0027 \u0027It would be a meaningless formality, surely.\u0027 \u0027Well, perhaps.\u0027 Koropatsky nodded. \u0027And perhaps it even works better this way. You know the superluminal ship is ready to move. We hope to launch it at the beginning of 2237.\u0027 \u0027So I have been told by Dr Wendel, Director.\u0027 \u0027The neuronic detectors are installed and work well.\u0027 \u0027I have been told that, too, Director.\u0027 Koropatsky held one hand in the other in his lap and nodded his large head ponderously. Then he looked up quickly at Fisher and said, \u0027Do you know how it works?\u0027 Fisher shook his head. \u0027No, sir. I know nothing about the actual workings of the ship.\u0027 Koropatsky nodded his head again. \u0027Nor I. We have to accept the word of Dr Wendel and our engineers. One thing is still lacking, though.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 (Cold anxiety swept over Fisher. More delay?) \u0027What is lacking, Director?\u0027 \u0027Communications. I would think that if there is a device that can make a ship move much faster than light, there should also be a device that would send waves, or some other form of message-carrying device, faster than light, too. It seems to me it would be easier to send a superluminal message than drive a superluminal ship.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t say, Director.\u0027 \u0027Yet Dr Wendel assures me that the reverse is true; that, as yet, there is no method of efficient superluminal communication. Eventually, there will be, she says, but not now, and she doesn\u0027t want to wait for such communication, which, she says, may take a long time.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want to wait either, Director.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I\u0027m anxious for progress and success. We\u0027ve been waiting years already, and I am eager to see the ship leave and return. But it does mean that once the ship leaves, we will be out of contact.\u0027 He nodded thoughtfully, and Fisher maintained a discreet silence. (What was all this about? What was the old bear getting at?) Koropatsky looked up at Fisher. \u0027You know that the Neighbor Star is heading in our direction?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director, I\u0027ve heard of that, but it seems to be the common feeling that it will pass us at a great enough distance to leave us unaffected.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the feeling we want people to have. Now the truth is, Fisher, that the Neighbor Star will pass closely enough to disturb Earth\u0027s orbital motion substantially.\u0027 Fisher paused for a moment in shock. \u0027And destroy the planet?\u0027 \u0027Not physically. The climate will be sufficiently changed, however, so that Earth will no longer be habitable.\u0027 \u0027Is that certain?\u0027 said Fisher, reluctant to believe it. \u0027I don\u0027t know that scientists are ever really certain. But they seem sufficiently close to certain to make it necessary for us to begin to take measures. We have five thousand years, and we are developing superluminal flight - assuming the ship works.\u0027 \u0027If Dr Wendel says it will work, Director, I\u0027m convinced it will.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s hope your confidence is not misplaced. Nevertheless, even five thousand years with superluminal flight leaves us in a bad spot. We would have to build a hundred and thirty thousand Settlements like Rotor to carry off Earth\u0027s eight billion people plus enough plants and animals to set up viable worlds. That\u0027s twenty-six Noah\u0027s Arks a year, starting right now. That\u0027s assuming there\u0027s no increase in population over the next five thousand years.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 said Fisher cautiously, \u0027we can handle an average of twenty-six a year. Our experience and expertise should increase with the centuries, and our population control has worked for decades.\u0027 \u0027Very well. Now tell me this: If we do lift Earth\u0027s population into space in one hundred and thirty thousand Settlements, making use of Earth\u0027s full resources, plus those of the Moon, Mars, and the asteroids, and abandon the Solar System to the gravitational mercies of the Neighbor Star, where do all these Settlements go?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, Director,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027We will have to find planets sufficiently Earth-like to accept our vast population without prohibitive requirements for terraforming. We must think of that, too, and we must think of it now, not five thousand years from now.\u0027 \u0027Even if we don\u0027t find suitable planets, we can put the Settlements into orbit about suitable stars.\u0027 Inevitably, Fisher made circular movements with his finger. \u0027My dear man, that wouldn\u0027t work.\u0027 \u0027With all respect, Director, it does work right here in the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027Not at all. There\u0027s a planet here in the Solar System that even today, despite all the Settlements, contains 99 per cent of the human species. We are still humanity, and the Settlements are just a kind of fluff that surrounds us. Could the fluff exist by itself? We have no proof that they can, and I think not.\u0027 \u0027You may be right, Director,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027May be? There\u0027s no doubt about it,\u0027 said Koropatsky heatedly. \u0027The Settlers affect to despise us, but we fill their thoughts. We\u0027re their history. We\u0027re their model. We\u0027re the teeming source to which they return again and again for re-invigoration. Left to themselves, they would wither.\u0027 \u0027You may be right, Director, but the experiment has never been tried. We have never had a situation in which Settlements tried to exist without a planet-\u0027 \u0027But we have had such a situation, at least in analogy, In Earth\u0027s early history, human beings settled islands and were isolated from the mainstream. The Irish settled Iceland; the Norse settled Greenland; the mutineers settled Pitcairn Island; the Polynesians settled Easter Island. Result? The colonists withered, sometimes disappeared entirely. Always stagnation. No civilization ever developed except in a continental area, or in islands in close proximity to a continental area. Humanity needs space, size, variety, a horizon, a frontier. You see?\u0027 Fisher said, \u0027Yes, Director.\u0027 (Past a certain point, why argue?) \u0027So that\u0027 - and Koropatsky put his right forefinger on his left palm, didactically - \u0027we must find a planet, at least one planet to begin with. Which brings us to Rotor.\u0027 Fisher raised his eyebrows in surprise. \u0027To Rotor, Director?\u0027 \u0027Yes. In the fourteen years since they\u0027ve left, what\u0027s happened to them?\u0027 \u0027Dr Wendel is of the opinion that they may not have survived.\u0027 (He felt a pang saying it. He always felt a pang when he thought about it.) \u0027I know she does. I\u0027ve talked to her, and I\u0027ve accepted what she has said without discussion. But I\u0027d like your opinion.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have one, Director. I have only the earnest hope that they have survived. I have a daughter on Rotor.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps you still have. Think! What was there to have destroyed them? A malfunctioning part. Rotor is not a ship, but a Settlement that for fifty years had had no serious malfunction. It traveled through empty space between here and the Neighbor Star and what can be more harmless than empty space?\u0027 \u0027A mini-black hole, an undetected asteroidal body-\u0027 \u0027What evidence? Those are just guesses and of almost zero probability, the astronomers tell me. Is it something about the inherent properties of hyperspace that may have destroyed Rotor? We\u0027ve been experimenting with hyperspace for years now and there is nothing inherently dangerous in it that we can find. So we can suppose that Rotor reached the Neighbor Star safely - if that\u0027s where they went, and all seem to agree that it makes no sense to suppose they went anywhere else.\u0027 \u0027I would like to think that they arrived safely.\u0027 \u0027But then the question arises: If Rotor is safe at the Neighbor Star, what is it doing there?\u0027 \u0027Existing.\u0027 (It was halfway between a statement and a question.) \u0027But how? Circling the Neighbor Star? A single Settlement on an endless, lonely journey about a red dwarf star? I don\u0027t think so. They would wither, and it would not take them long to realize that. I am sure they would wither fast.\u0027 \u0027And die? Is that your conclusion, Director?\u0027 \u0027No. They would give up and come home. They would acknowledge defeat and come back to safety. However, they have not done so, and do you know what I\u0027ve been thinking? I\u0027ve been thinking they\u0027ve found a habitable planet at the Neighbor Star.\u0027 \u0027But there can\u0027t be a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star, Director. There\u0027s a shortage of energy, unless you get so close that there\u0027s too much tidal effect.\u0027 He paused and muttered, shamefaced, \u0027Dr Wendel explained that to me.\u0027 \u0027Yes, astronomers have explained it to me, too. But\u0027 - he shook his head - \u0027experience has taught me that no matter how sure scientists think they are, nature has a way of surprising them. Anyway, do you understand why we are letting you go on this voyage?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director. Your predecessor promised I would go in return for services rendered.\u0027 \u0027I have a better reason than that. My predecessor, who was a great man, an admirable man, was also a sick old man at the end. His enemies thought that he had become paranoid. He believed Rotor knew of Earth\u0027s danger and had left without warning us because they wanted Earth destroyed, and that Rotor must therefore be punished. However, he is gone, and I am here. I am not old, or sick, or paranoid. Assuming Rotor is safe and is at the Neighbor Star, it is not our intention to harm them.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad of that, but isn\u0027t this something you ought to discuss with Dr Wendel, Director? She is to be the captain of the ship.\u0027 \u0027Dr Wendel is a Settler. You are a loyal Earthman.\u0027 \u0027Dr Wendel has worked loyally for years on the superluminal project.\u0027 \u0027That she has been loyal to the project is beyond question. But is she loyal to Earth? Can we count on her to carry out the letter and the spirit of Earth\u0027s intentions toward Rotor?\u0027 \u0027May I ask, Director, just what Earth\u0027s intentions are toward Rotor? I take it that there is no longer the intention of punishing the Settlement for its failure to warn us.\u0027 \u0027That is correct. What we want now is association, human brotherhood, only the kindliest of feelings. With friendship established, there must be a quick return with as much information as possible about Rotor and its planet.\u0027 \u0027Surely if Dr Wendel is told this - if she has this explained to her - she will carry it out.\u0027 Koropatsky chuckled. \u0027One would think so, but you know how it is. She is a woman who is not in the first bloom of youth. A fine woman - I have no fault to find - but she is in her fifties.\u0027 \u0027What of that?\u0027 (Fisher found himself offended.) \u0027She must know that when she comes back, with the vital experience of a successful superluminal flight, she will be more valuable to us than ever; that she will be needed to design newer, better, more advanced superluminal vessels; that she will have to train young people as superluminal pilots. She will be quite sure that she will never be allowed to venture out through hyper-space again, for she will simply be too valuable to risk. Therefore, before coming back, she may be tempted to explore further. She may not wish to abandon the thrill of seeing new stars and penetrating new horizons. But we cannot have her take one risk more than she must take to reach Rotor, gain the information, and return. We cannot afford the time lost either. Do you understand?\u0027 His voice had become hard. Fisher swallowed. \u0027Surely you have no real reason-\u0027 \u0027I have every reason. Dr Wendel has always been in a delicate position here - as a Settler. You understand, I hope. Of all the people on Earth, she is the one we depend on most, and she is a Settler. She has had to be the subject of a detailed psychological profile. She has been extensively studied, with and without her knowledge, and we are quite certain that, given a chance, she will go off exploring. And she will be out of communication with us. We won\u0027t know where she is, what she is doing. We won\u0027t even know if she is alive.\u0027 \u0027And why are you telling me all this, Director?\u0027 \u0027Because we know you have a great influence over her. She can be guided by you - if you are firm.\u0027 \u0027I think, perhaps, you overestimate my influence, Director.\u0027 \u0027I am sure we don\u0027t. You, too, have been much studied, and we know exactly how bound the good doctor is to you - perhaps more than you yourself realize. We know, also, that you are a loyal son of Earth. You might have left with Rotor, stayed with your wife and daughter, but you returned to Earth at the cost of losing them. You did that, moreover, knowing that my predecessor, Director Tanayama, would consider you a failure for failing to bring information back concerning hyper-assistance, and that your career might well be ruined. That satisfies me that I can count on you to see to it that Dr Wendel is kept under firm control and is brought back to us quickly and that you will, this time - this time - bring back the information we need.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll try, Director,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027You say that dubiously,\u0027 said Koropatsky. \u0027Please understand the importance of what I am asking you to do. We must know just what they\u0027re doing, how strong they are, and what the planet is like. Once we know all that, we will know what we must do, and how strong we must be, and for what kind of a life we must be prepared. Because, Fisher, we must have a planet, and we must have it now. And we have no choice but to take Rotor\u0027s planet.\u0027 \u0027If it exists,\u0027 said Fisher hoarsely. \u0027It had better exist,\u0027 said Koropatsky. \u0027Earth\u0027s survival depends upon it.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-27.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
