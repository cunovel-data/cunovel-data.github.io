{"id":70495,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"22 Eugenia Insigna greeted her daughter\u0027s statement with a half-laugh of disbelief. How does one go about doubting a young daughter\u0027s sanity as an alternative to doubting one\u0027s own hearing capacity? \u0027What did you say, Marlene? What do you mean I\u0027m going to Erythro?\u0027 \u0027I asked Commissioner Pitt, and he said he would arrange it.\u0027 Insigna looked blank. \u0027But why?\u0027 Betraying a bit of irritation, Marlene answered, \u0027Because you say you want to make delicate astronomical measurements and you can\u0027t do it delicately enough from Rotor. You can do it from Erythro. But I see I\u0027m not answering your real question.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right. What I meant was why should Commissioner Pitt have said he would arrange it? I\u0027ve asked several times before this, and he has always refused. He\u0027s unwilling to let anyone go to Erythro - except for some specialists.\u0027 \u0027I just put it to him in a different way, Mother.\u0027 Marlene hesitated a moment. \u0027I told him that I knew he was anxious to get rid of you and this was his chance.\u0027 Insigna drew in her breath so sharply that she choked slightly and had to cough. Then, eyes watering, she said, \u0027How could you say that?\u0027 \u0027Because it\u0027s true, Mother. I wouldn\u0027t have said it if it weren\u0027t true. I\u0027ve heard him speak to you, and I\u0027ve heard you speak about him, and it\u0027s just so clear that I know you see it, too. He\u0027s annoyed with you, and wishes you\u0027d stop bothering him about - about whatever you bother him about. You know that.\u0027 Insigna pressed her lips together and said, \u0027You know, darling, I\u0027m going to have to take you into my confidence from now on. It really embarrasses me to have you worm these things out.\u0027 \u0027I know, Mother.\u0027 Marlene\u0027s eyes dropped. \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027But I still don\u0027t understand. You didn\u0027t have to explain to him that he\u0027s annoyed with me. He must know he is. Why, then, didn\u0027t he send me to Erythro when I asked him to do so in the past?\u0027 \u0027Because he hates having anything to do with Erythro, and just getting rid of you wasn\u0027t enough to overcome his dislike of the world. Only this time it\u0027s not just you going. It\u0027s you and I. Both of us.\u0027 Insigna leaned forward, placing her hands flat on the table between them. \u0027No, Molly - Marlene. Erythro is not the place for you. I won\u0027t be there for ever. I\u0027ll take my measurements and come back and you\u0027ll stay right here and wait for me.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid not, Mother. It\u0027s clear that he\u0027s only willing to let you go because that\u0027s the only way he can get rid of me. That\u0027s why he agreed to send you when I asked that we both go, and wouldn\u0027t agree when you asked that just you go. Do you see?\u0027 Insigna frowned. \u0027No, I don\u0027t. I really don\u0027t. What do you have to do with it?\u0027 \u0027When we were talking, and I explained that I knew he would like to get rid of both of us, his face froze - you know, so he could wipe out all expression. He knew I could understand expressions and little things like that, and he didn\u0027t me want to guess what he was feeling, I suppose. But that\u0027s also a giveaway, you see, and tells me a lot. Besides, you can\u0027t suppress everything. Your eyes flicker, and I guess you don\u0027t even know it.\u0027 \u0027So you knew he wanted to get rid of you, too.\u0027 \u0027Worse than that. He\u0027s scared of me.\u0027 \u0027Why should he be scared of you?\u0027 \u0027I suppose because he hates having me know what he doesn\u0027t want me to know.\u0027 She added with a dour sigh, \u0027Lots of people get upset with me for that.\u0027 Insigna nodded. \u0027I can understand that. You make people feel naked - mentally naked, I mean, like a cold wind is blowing across their minds.\u0027 Her eyes focused on her daughter. \u0027Sometimes I feel that way myself. Looking back, I think you\u0027ve disturbed me since you were a small child. I told myself often enough that you were simply unusually intelli-\u0027 \u0027I think I am,\u0027 said Marlene quickly. \u0027That, too, yes, but it was clearly something more than that, though I didn\u0027t see it very clearly. Tell me - do you mind talking about this?\u0027 \u0027Not to you, Mother,\u0027 said Marlene, but there was a note of caution in her voice. \u0027Well then, when you were younger and found out that you could do this and other children couldn\u0027t - and even other grown-ups couldn\u0027t - why didn\u0027t you come and tell me about it?\u0027 \u0027I tried once, actually, but you were impatient. I mean, you didn\u0027t say anything, but I could tell you were busy and couldn\u0027t be bothered with childish nonsense.\u0027 Insigna\u0027s eyes widened. \u0027Did I say it was childish nonsense?\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t say it, but the way you looked at me and the way you were holding your hands said it.\u0027 \u0027You should have insisted on telling me.\u0027 \u0027I was just a little kid. And you were unhappy most of the time - about Commissioner Pitt, and about Father.\u0027 \u0027Never mind about that. Is there anything else you can tell me now?\u0027 There\u0027s only one thing,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027When Commissioner Pitt said we could go, there was something about the way he said it that made me think he left out something - that there was something he didn\u0027t say.\u0027 \u0027And what was it, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s just it, Mother. I can\u0027t read minds, so I don\u0027t know. I can only go by outside things and that leaves things hazy, sometimes. Still-\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027I have the feeling that whatever it was he didn\u0027t say was rather unpleasant - maybe even evil.\u0027 23 Getting ready for Erythro took Insigna quite a while, of course. There were matters on Rotor that could not be left at midpoint. There had to be arrangements in the astronomy department, instructions to others, appointment of her chief associate to the position of Chief Astronomer pro-tem, and some final consultations with Pitt, who was oddly non-communicative on the matter. Insigna finally put it to him during her last report before leaving. \u0027I\u0027m going to Erythro tomorrow, you know,\u0027 she said. \u0027Pardon me?\u0027 He looked up from the final report she had handed him, and which he had been staring at, though she was convinced he wasn\u0027t reading it. (Was she picking up some of Marlene\u0027s tricks and not knowing how to handle it? She mustn\u0027t begin to believe that she was penetrating below the surface when, in fact, she was not.) She said patiently, \u0027I\u0027m going to Erythro tomorrow, you know.\u0027 \u0027Is it tomorrow? Well, you\u0027ll be coming back eventually, so this is not goodbye. Take care of yourself. Look upon it as a vacation.\u0027 \u0027I intend to be working on Nemesis\u0027 motion through space.\u0027 \u0027That? Well-\u0027 He made a gesture with both hands as though pushing something unimportant away. \u0027As you wish. A change of surroundings is a vacation even if you continue working.\u0027 \u0027I want to thank you for allowing this, Janus.\u0027 \u0027Your daughter asked me to. Did you know she asked me to?\u0027 \u0027I know. She told me the same day. I told her she had no right to bother you. You were very tolerant of her.\u0027 Pitt grunted. \u0027She\u0027s a very unusual girl. I didn\u0027t mind obliging her. It\u0027s only temporary. Finish your calculations and return.\u0027 She thought: That\u0027s twice he mentioned my return. What would Marlene make out of that if she were here? Something evil, as she says? But what? She said evenly, \u0027We\u0027ll come back.\u0027 He said, \u0027With the news, I hope, that Nemesis will prove harmless - five thousand years from now.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s for the facts to decide,\u0027 she said grimly, then left. 24 It was strange, Eugenia Insigna thought. She was over two light-years from the spot in space where she was born and yet she had only been on a spaceship twice and then for the shortest possible journeys - from Rotor to Earth and then back to Rotor again. She still had no great urge to travel in space. It was Marlene who was the driving force behind this trip. It was she who, independently, had seen Pitt and persuaded him to succumb to her strange form of blackmail. And it was she who was truly excited, with this odd compulsion of hers to visit Erythro. Insigna could not understand that compulsion and viewed it as another part of her daughter\u0027s unique mental and emotional complexity. Still, whenever Insigna quailed at the thought of leaving safe, small, comfortable Rotor for the vast empty world of Erythro, so strange and menacing, and fully six hundred and fifty thousand kilometers away (nearly twice as far away as Rotor had been from Earth), it was Marlene\u0027s excitement that reinvigorated her. The ship that would take them to Erythro was neither graceful nor beautiful. It was serviceable. It was one of a small fleet of rockets that acted as ferries, blasting up from the stodgy gravitational pull of Erythro, or coming down without daring to give in to it by even a trifle, and, either way, working one\u0027s way through the cushiony, windy unpredictability of an untamed atmosphere. Insigna didn\u0027t think the trip would be pleasurable. Through most of it they would be weightless and two solid days of weightlessness would, no doubt, be tedious. Marlene\u0027s voice broke into her reverie. \u0027Come on, Mother, they\u0027re waiting for us. The baggage is all checked and everything.\u0027 Insigna moved forward. Her last uneasy thought as she passed through the airlock was - predictably - But why was Janus Pitt so willing to let us go? 25 Siever Genarr ruled a world as large as Earth. Or, to be more accurate perhaps, he ruled, directly, a domed region that covered nearly three square kilometers and was slowly growing. The rest of the world, however, nearly five hundred million square kilometers of land and sea, was unoccupied by human beings. It was also occupied by no other living things above the microscopic scale. So if a world is considered as being ruled by the multicellular life-forms that occupied it, the hundreds who lived and worked in the domed region were the rulers, and Siever Genarr ruled over them. Genarr was not a large man, but his strong features gave him an impressive look. When he was young, this had made him look older than his age - but that had evened itself out now that he was nearly fifty. His nose was long and his eyes somewhat pouchy. His hair was in the first stages of grizzle. His voice, however, was a musical and resonant baritone. (He had once thought of the stage as a career, but his appearance doomed him to occasional character roles, and his talents as an administrator took precedence.) It was those talents - partly - that had kept him in the Erythro Dome for ten years, watching it grow from an uncertain three-room structure to the expansive mining and research station it had now become. The Dome had its disadvantages. Few people remained long. There were shifts, since almost all those who came there considered themselves in exile and wished, more or less constantly, to return to Rotor. And most found the pinkish light of Nemesis either threatening or gloomy, even though the light inside the Dome was every bit as bright and homelike as that on Rotor. It had its advantages, too. Genarr was removed from the hurly-burly of Rotorian politics, which seemed more ingrown and meaningless each year. Even more important, he was removed from Janus Pitt, whose views he generally - and uselessly - opposed. Pitt had been strenuously opposed to any settlement on Erythro from the start - even to Rotor orbiting around Erythro. Here, at least, Pitt had been defeated by overwhelming public opinion, but he saw to it that the Dome was generally starved for funds and that its growth was slowed. If Genarr had not successfully developed the Dome as a source of water for Rotor - far cheaper than it could be obtained from the asteroids - Pitt might have crushed it. In general, though, Pitt\u0027s principle of ignoring the Dome\u0027s existence as far as possible meant that he rarely attempted to interfere with Genarr\u0027s administrative procedures - which suited Genarr right down to Erythro\u0027s damp soil. It came as a surprise to him, then, that Pitt should have bothered to inform him personally of the arrival of a pair of newcomers, instead of allowing the information to show up in the routine paperwork. Pitt had, indeed, discussed the matter in detail, in his usual clipped and arbitrary manner that invited no discussion, or even comment, and the conversation had been shielded, too. It came as an even greater surprise that one of the people coming to Erythro was Eugenia Insigna. Once, years before the Leaving, they had been friends, but then, after their happy college days (Genarr remembered them wistfully as rather romantic), Eugenia had gone to Earth for her graduate studies and had returned to Rotor with an Earthman. Genarr had scarcely seen her - except once or twice, at a distance - since she had married Crile Fisher. And when she and Fisher had separated, just before the Leaving, Genarr had had work of his own and so had she - and it never occurred to either to renew old ties. Genarr had, perhaps, thought of it occasionally, but Eugenia was quite apparently sunk in sorrow, with an infant daughter to raise, and he was reluctant to intrude. Then he was sent to Erythro and that ended even the possibility of renewal. He had periodic vacation time on Rotor, but he was never at ease there any longer. Some old Rotorian friendships remained, but only in lukewarm fashion. Now Eugenia was coming with her daughter. Genarr, at the moment, didn\u0027t remember the girl\u0027s name - if he had ever known it. Certainly, he had never seen her. The daughter should be fifteen by now, and he wondered, with a queer little interior tremble, if she was beginning to look anything like the young Eugenia had. Genarr looked out his office window with an almost surreptitious air. He had grown so used to Erythro Dome that he no longer saw it with a critical eye. It was the home of working people of both sexes - adults, no children. Shift workers, signed up for a period of weeks or possibly months, sometimes returning eventually for another shift, sometimes not. Except for himself and four others who, for one reason or another, had learned to prefer the Dome, there were no permanents. There was no-one to take pride in it as an ordinary abode. It was kept clean and orderly as a matter of necessity, but there was also an air of artificiality about it. It was too much a matter of lines and arcs, planes and circles. It lacked irregularity, lacked the chaos of permanent life, where a room, or even just a desk, had adjusted itself to the hollows and waverings of a particular personality. There was himself, of course. His desk and his room reflected his own angular and planar person. That, perhaps, might be another reason he was at home in the Erythro Dome. The shape of his inner spirit matched its spare geometry. But what would Eugenia Insigna think of it? (He was rather pleased she had resumed her maiden name.) If she were as he remembered her, she would revel in irregularity, in the unexpected touch of frippery, for all she was an astronomer. Or had she changed? Did people ever change, essentially? Had Crile Fisher\u0027s desertion embittered her, twisted her- Genarr scratched the hair at his temple where it had gone distinctly gray and thought that these speculations were useless and time-wasting. He would see Eugenia soon enough, for he had left word that she was to be brought to him as soon as she had arrived. Or should he have gone to greet her in person? No! He had argued that with himself half a dozen times already. He couldn\u0027t look too anxious; it wouldn\u0027t suit the dignity of his position. But then Genarr thought that that wasn\u0027t the reason at all. He didn\u0027t want to make her uneasy; he didn\u0027t want her to think he was still the same uncomfortable and incompetent admirer who had retreated in so shambling a manner before the tall and brooding good looks of the Earthman. And Eugenia had never looked at him again after she had seen Crile - never seriously looked at him. Genarr\u0027s eyes scanned the message from Janus Pitt - dry, condensed, as his messages always were, and with that indefinable feel of authority behind it, as though the possibility of disagreement were not merely unheard of - but actually unthought of. And he now noted that Pitt spoke more forcefully of the young daughter than of the mother. There was especially Pitt\u0027s statement that the daughter had expressed a deep interest in Erythro, and if she wished to explore its surface, she was to be allowed to. Now why was that? 26 And there she was. Fourteen years older than at the time of the Leaving. Twenty years older than she was in her pre-Crile youth, the day they had gone into Farming Area C and climbed the levels into low gravity, and she had laughed when he tried a slow somersault and had turned too far and had come down on his belly. (Actually, he could easily have hurt himself, for though the sensation of weight decreased, mass and inertia did not, and damage could follow. Fortunately, he had not suffered that humiliation.) Eugenia looked older, too, but she had not thickened very much, and her hair - shorter now, and straight - was more matter-of-fact somehow, but was still a lively dark brown. And when she advanced toward him, smiling, he could feel his traitor heart speed a bit. She held out both hands and he took them. \u0027Siever,\u0027 she said, \u0027I have betrayed you, and I\u0027m so ashamed.\u0027 \u0027Betrayed me, Eugenia? What are you talking about?\u0027 What was she talking about? Surely not her marriage to Crile. She said, \u0027I should have thought of you every day. I should have sent you messages, given you the news, insisted on coming to visit you.\u0027 \u0027Instead, you never thought of me at all!\u0027 \u0027Oh, I\u0027m not that bad. I thought of you every once in a while. I never really forgot you. Don\u0027t think that for a moment. It\u0027s just that my thoughts never really prompted me to do anything.\u0027 Genarr nodded. What was there to say? He said, \u0027I know you\u0027ve been busy. And I\u0027ve been here - out of sight and, therefore, out of mind.\u0027 \u0027Not out of mind. You\u0027ve scarcely changed at all, Siever.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the advantage of looking old and craggy when you\u0027re twenty. After that, you never change, Eugenia. Time passes and you just look a trifle older and a trifle craggier. Not enough to matter.\u0027 \u0027Come now, you make a profession of being cruel to yourself so that soft-hearted women will leap to your defense. That hasn\u0027t changed at all.\u0027 \u0027Where\u0027s your daughter, Eugenia? I was told she would be coming with you.\u0027 \u0027She came. You can be sure of that. Erythro is her idea of Paradise, for no reason I can possibly think of. She went to our quarters to straighten them out and unpack for the two of us. She\u0027s that kind of young woman. Serious. Responsible. Practical. Dutiful. She possesses what someone once described to me as all the unlovable virtues.\u0027 Genarr laughed. \u0027I\u0027m quite at home with them. If you only knew how hard I\u0027ve tried, in my time, to cultivate at least one charming vice. I\u0027ve always failed.\u0027 \u0027Oh well, as one grows older, I suspect one needs more unlovable virtues and fewer charming vices. But why did you retreat permanently to Erythro, Siever? I understand that Erythro Dome has to be administered, but surely you\u0027re not the only one on Rotor who can do the job.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Actually, I like to think I am. In a way, though, I enjoy it here and I do get to Rotor on occasion for a short vacation.\u0027 \u0027And never come to see me?\u0027 \u0027Just because I have a vacation doesn\u0027t mean you do. I suspect you\u0027re far busier than I am, and have been ever since you discovered Nemesis. But I\u0027m disappointed. I wanted to meet your daughter.\u0027 \u0027You will. Her name\u0027s Marlene. Actually, it\u0027s Molly in my heart, but she won\u0027t allow that. At the age of fifteen, she has become remarkably intolerant and insists on being called Marlene. But you\u0027ll meet her, never fear. Actually, I didn\u0027t want her here the first time. How could we reminisce freely with her present?\u0027 \u0027Do you want to reminisce, Eugenia?\u0027 \u0027About some things.\u0027 Genarr hesitated. \u0027I\u0027m sorry Crile didn\u0027t join the Leaving.\u0027 Insigna\u0027s smile became fixed. \u0027About some things, Siever.\u0027 She turned away and walked to the window, staring out. \u0027This is an elaborate place you have here, by the way. Just the little I\u0027ve seen of it is impressive. Bright lights. Actual streets. Sizable buildings. And yet the Dome is hardly ever spoken of or referred to back on Rotor. How many people live and work here?\u0027 \u0027It varies. We have our slow and busy times. We\u0027ve had as many as nearly nine hundred people here. At the moment, the number is five hundred and sixteen. We know every individual present. It\u0027s not easy. Each day sees some come, some go.\u0027 \u0027Except you.\u0027 \u0027And a few others.\u0027 \u0027But why the Dome, Siever? After all, Erythro\u0027s atmosphere is breathable.\u0027 Genarr pushed out his lower lip and, for the first time, he did not meet her eyes. \u0027Breathable, but not really comfortable. The light level is wrong. When you get outside the Dome, you\u0027re bathed in a pinkish light, tending to orange when Nemesis is high in the sky. It\u0027s bright enough. You can read. Still, it doesn\u0027t seem natural. Then, too, Nemesis itself doesn\u0027t look natural. It looks too large, and most people think it looks threatening and that its reddish light makes it seem angry - and they get depressed. Nemesis is dangerous in actual fact, too, at least in a way. Because it isn\u0027t blindingly bright, there is a tendency to gaze at it and watch for sunspots. The infrared can easily harm the retina. People who must go out in the open wear a special helmet for that reason - among other things.\u0027 \u0027Then the Dome is more of a device to keep normal light in, so to speak, rather than to keep anything out.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t even keep air out. The air and water that circulates in the Dome is drawn from Erythro\u0027s planetary supply. Naturally, though, we\u0027re careful to keep something out,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027We keep out the prokaryotes. You know, the little blue-green cells.\u0027 Insigna nodded thoughtfully. That had turned out to be the explanation for the oxygen content in the air. There was life on Erythro, even all-pervasive life, but it was microscopic in nature, only equivalent to the simplest forms of cellular life in the Solar System. She said, \u0027Are they really prokaryotes? I know that\u0027s what they\u0027re called, but that\u0027s what our bacteria are also called. Are they bacteria?\u0027 \u0027If they\u0027re equivalent to anything in the history of Solar System life, it is to the cyanobacteria, those that photo-synthesize. You\u0027re right to ask the question, though. No, they\u0027re not our cyanobacteria. They possess nucleoprotein, but with a structure fundamentally different from that which prevails in our form of life. They also have a kind of chlorophyll that lacks magnesium and works on infrared so that the cells tend to be colorless rather than green. Different enzymes, trace minerals in different proportions. Still, they resemble Earth cells sufficiently in outer appearance to be called prokaryotes. I understand that biologists are pushing for the word \"erythryotes\" but for nonbiologists like ourselves, prokaryotes is good enough.\u0027 \u0027And they\u0027re efficient enough in their workings to account for the oxygen in Erythro\u0027s atmosphere?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely. Nothing else could possibly explain its existence there. By the way, Eugenia, you\u0027re the astronomer, so what\u0027s the latest thinking on how old Nemesis might be?\u0027 Insigna shrugged. \u0027Red dwarfs are next to being immortal. Nemesis can be as old as the Universe and still go on for another hundred billion years or so without visible change. The best we can do is judge by the contents of the minor elements making up its structure. Supposing that it\u0027s a first-generation star and didn\u0027t begin with anything beyond hydrogen and helium, it is a bit over ten billion years old - a little more than twice the age of the Sun of the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027Then Erythro is ten billion years old, too.\u0027 \u0027Absolutely. A stellar system is formed all at once and not piecemeal. Why are you asking?\u0027 \u0027It just strikes me as odd that in ten billion years, life hasn\u0027t got past the prokaryote stage.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think that\u0027s surprising, Siever. On Earth, for somewhere between two and three billion years after life first appeared, it remained strictly prokaryote, and here on Erythro the energy concentration in sunlight is far less than it is on Earth. It takes energy to form more complicated life-forms. This sort of thing has been pretty well discussed among the Rotorians.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure of it,\u0027 said Genarr, \u0027but it doesn\u0027t seem to reach us here at the Dome. Our minds are too fixed, I suppose, on our local duties and problems - though you\u0027d think anything to do with the prokaryotes would come under that heading.\u0027 \u0027For that matter,\u0027 said Insigna, \u0027we don\u0027t hear much about the Dome on Rotor.\u0027 \u0027Yes, things tend to compartmentalize. But then, of course, there\u0027s nothing glamorous about the Dome, Eugenia. It\u0027s just a workshop, so I\u0027m not surprised it gets lost in the press of events on Rotor. It\u0027s the new Settlements that are being built that get all the attention. Are you going to move to one of them?\u0027 \u0027Never. I\u0027m a Rotorian, and I intend to stay one. I wouldn\u0027t even be here - if you\u0027ll pardon my saying so - if it weren\u0027t an astronomical necessity. I\u0027ve got to make a number of observations from a base that is more stable than Rotor.\u0027 \u0027So I have been informed by Pitt. I am instructed to give you my full cooperation.\u0027 \u0027Good. I\u0027m sure you will. Incidentally, you mentioned earlier that the Dome would like to keep the prokaryotes out. Do you succeed in doing so? Is the water here safe to drink?\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Obviously, since we drink it. There are no prokaryotes in the Dome. Any water that comes in - anything at all that comes in - is bathed in blue-violet light that destroys the prokaryotes in a matter of seconds. The short-wave photons in the light are too energetic for the little things and break down key components of the cells. And even if some of them come in, they\u0027re not poisonous, as far as we can tell, or harmful in any way. We\u0027ve tested them on animals.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a relief.\u0027 \u0027It works the other way, too. Our own microorganisms can\u0027t compete with Erythro\u0027s prokaryotes under Erythrotic conditions. At least when we seed Erythro\u0027s soil with our own bacteria, they don\u0027t succeed in growing and multiplying.\u0027 \u0027What about multicellular plants?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve tried it, but with very poor results. And it must be due to the quality of Nemesis\u0027 light because we can grow plants perfectly well inside the Dome, using Erythro\u0027s soil and water. We report these things back to Rotor, of course, but I doubt that the information gets widely publicized. As I said, Rotor isn\u0027t interested in the Dome. Certainly the fearsome Pitt isn\u0027t interested in us, and he\u0027s really all that counts on Rotor, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 Genarr said that with a smile, but the smile seemed strained. (What would Marlene have said about it, Insigna wondered.) She said, \u0027Pitt isn\u0027t fearsome. He\u0027s sometimes tiresome, but that\u0027s a different thing. You know, Siever, I always thought when we were young that you might be Commissioner someday. You were enormously bright, you know.\u0027 \u0027Were?\u0027 \u0027Still are, I\u0027m sure, but in those days you were so politically oriented, had such ideas. I used to listen to you, entranced. In some ways, you would have been a better Commissioner than Janus is. You would have listened to people. You wouldn\u0027t have insisted on getting your own way as much.\u0027 \u0027Which is precisely why I would have made a very poor Commissioner. You see, I don\u0027t have any precise goals in life. I just have the desire to do what seems to me to be the right thing at the moment, in the hope that it will end up with something bearable. Now, Pitt knows what he wants and intends to get there by any means.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re misjudging him, Siever. He\u0027s got strong views, but he\u0027s a very reasonable man.\u0027 \u0027Of course, Eugenia. That\u0027s his great gift, his reasonableness. Whatever course he pursues, he always has a perfectly good, a perfectly logical, a perfectly human reason for it. He can make one up at any given moment, and is so sincere about it, he convinces even himself. I\u0027m sure if you\u0027ve had any dealings with him, you\u0027ve managed to let him talk you into doing what you at first didn\u0027t want to do, and that he won you over not by orders and threats but by very patient, very rational arguments.\u0027 Insigna said weakly, \u0027Well-\u0027 At that, Genarr added sardonically, \u0027I see you have indeed suffered from his reasonableness. You can see for yourself, then, what a good Commissioner he is. Not a good person, but a good Commissioner.\u0027 \u0027I wouldn\u0027t go so far as to say he wasn\u0027t a good person, Siever,\u0027 said Insigna, shaking her head slightly. \u0027Well, let\u0027s not argue about it. I want to meet your daughter.\u0027 He rose to his feet. \u0027Why don\u0027t I visit your quarters after dinner?\u0027 \u0027That would be delightful,\u0027 said Insigna. Genarr looked after her with a fading smile as she left. Eugenia had wanted to reminisce, and his own first reaction was to mention her husband - and she had frozen. He sighed inwardly. He still had that extraordinary faculty of ruining his own chances. 27 Eugenia Insigna said to her daughter, \u0027His name is Siever Genarr, and he is properly addressed as Commander, because he\u0027s the head of the Erythro Dome.\u0027 \u0027Of course, Mother. If that\u0027s his title, I\u0027ll call him that.\u0027 \u0027And I don\u0027t want you to embarrass him-\u0027 \u0027I wouldn\u0027t do that.\u0027 \u0027You would do so all too easily, Marlene. You know that. Just accept his statements without correcting them on the ground of body language. Please! He was a good friend of mine at college and for a while afterward. And even though he\u0027s been here in the Dome for ten years and I haven\u0027t seen him in all that time, he\u0027s still an old friend.\u0027 \u0027I think he must have been a boyfriend.\u0027 \u0027Now that\u0027s just what I mean,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027I don\u0027t want you watching him and telling him what he really means or thinks or feels. And for your information, he was not my boyfriend, exactly, and we were certainly not lovers. We were friends and we liked each other - as friends. But after your father-\u0027 She shook her head, and gestured vaguely. \u0027And be careful what you say about Commissioner Pitt - if that subject comes up. I get the feeling Commander Genarr distrusts Commissioner Pitt-\u0027 Marlene bestowed one of her rare smiles on her mother. \u0027Have you been studying Commander Siever\u0027s subliminal behavior? Because what you have is more than a feeling.\u0027 Insigna shook her head. \u0027You see? You can\u0027t stop for a moment. Very well, it\u0027s not a feeling. He actually said he didn\u0027t trust the Commissioner. And you know,\u0027 she added, half to herself, \u0027he may have reason-\u0027 She turned to Marlene and said suddenly, \u0027Let me repeat, Marlene. You are perfectly free to watch the Commander and find out all you can, but don\u0027t say anything to him about it. Tell me! Do you understand?\u0027 \u0027Do you think there\u0027s danger, Mother?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027I do,\u0027 said Marlene matter-of-factly. \u0027I\u0027ve known there was danger as soon as Commissioner Pitt said we could go to Erythro. I just don\u0027t know what the danger is.\u0027 28 Seeing Marlene for the first time was a shock to Siever Genarr, one that was made worse by the fact that the girl looked at him with a sullen expression that made it seem that she knew perfectly well that he had received a shock, and just why. The fact was that there was not a thing about her that seemed to indicate she was Eugenia\u0027s daughter, none of the beauty, none of the grace, none of the charm. Only those large bright eyes that were now boring into him, and they weren\u0027t Eugenia\u0027s either. They were the one respect in which she exceeded her mother, rather than fell short. Little by little, though, he revised his first impression. He joined them for tea and dessert, and Marlene behaved herself with perfect propriety. Quite the lady, and obviously intelligent. What was it that Eugenia had said? All the unlovable virtues? Not quite that bad. It seemed to him that she ached for love, as plain people sometimes do. As he himself did. A sudden flood of fellow feeling swept over him. And after a while, he said, \u0027Eugenia, I wonder if I might have a chance to speak to Marlene alone.\u0027 Insigna said with an attempt at lightness, \u0027Any particular reason, Siever?\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Well, it was Marlene who spoke to Commissioner Pitt and it was she who persuaded the Commissioner to allow the two of you to come to the Dome. As Commander of the Dome, I\u0027m pretty much dependent on what Commissioner Pitt says and does, and I would value what Marlene can tell me of the meeting. I think she would speak more freely if it were just the two of us.\u0027 Genarr watched Insigna leave and then turned to Marlene, who was now sitting in a large chair in a corner of the room, almost lost in its soft capaciousness. Her hands were clasped loosely in her lap and her beautiful dark eyes regarded the Commander gravely. Genarr said with a hint of humor in his voice, \u0027Your mother seemed a little nervous about leaving you here with me. Are you nervous, too?\u0027 \u0027Not at all,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027And if my mother was nervous, it was on your behalf, not on mine.\u0027 \u0027On my behalf. Why?\u0027 \u0027She thinks I might say something that would offend you.\u0027 \u0027Would you, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Not deliberately, Commander. I\u0027ll try not to.\u0027 \u0027And I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll succeed. Do you know why I want to see you alone?\u0027 \u0027You told my mother you want to find out about my interview with Commissioner Pitt. That\u0027s true, but you also want to see what I\u0027m like.\u0027 Genarr\u0027s eyebrows drew together just a trifle. \u0027Naturally, I would want to get to know you better.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not that,\u0027 said Marlene quickly. \u0027What is it, then?\u0027 Marlene looked away. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Commander.\u0027 \u0027Sorry about what?\u0027 Marlene\u0027s face twitched unhappily and she was silent. Genarr said softly, \u0027Now, Marlene, what is wrong? You must tell me. It is important to me that we talk frankly. If your mother told you to watch what you say, please forget that. If she implied that I was sensitive and easily offended, please forget that, too. In fact, I command you to speak to me freely and not to worry a bit about offending me, and you must obey my command because I\u0027m the Commander of the Erythro Dome.\u0027 Marlene laughed suddenly. \u0027You\u0027re really anxious to find out about me, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 \u0027Because you\u0027re wondering how I can look the way I do, when I\u0027m my mother\u0027s daughter.\u0027 Genarr\u0027s eyes opened wide. \u0027I never said anything of the sort.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t have to. You\u0027re an old friend of my mother\u0027s. She told me that much. But you were in love with her, and you haven\u0027t quite gotten over it, and you were expecting me to look the way she did when she was young, so when you saw me, you winced and drew back.\u0027 \u0027I did? It was noticeable?\u0027 \u0027It was a very small gesture because you\u0027re a polite man and you tried to repress it, but it was there. I saw it easily. And then your eyes turned to my mother and back to me. And then there was the tone of your first words to me. It was all very plain. You were thinking I didn\u0027t look at all like my mother and you were disappointed.\u0027 Genarr leaned back in his chair and said, \u0027But this is marvelous.\u0027 And a great gladness lit up Marlene\u0027s face. \u0027You mean it, Commander. You mean it. You\u0027re not offended. You\u0027re not uncomfortable. It makes you happy. You\u0027re the first one, the first one. Even my mother doesn\u0027t like it.\u0027 \u0027Liking or not liking it doesn\u0027t matter. That is totally irrelevant when it\u0027s a question of coming up against the extraordinary. How long have you been able to read body language in this way, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Always, but I\u0027ve gotten better at it. I think anyone must be able to do it, if they only watch - and think.\u0027 \u0027Not so, Marlene. It can\u0027t be done. Don\u0027t think it. And you say I love your mother.\u0027 \u0027No doubt about it, Commander. When you\u0027re near her, you give it away with every look, every word, every twitch.\u0027 \u0027Do you suppose she notices?\u0027 \u0027She suspects you do, but she doesn\u0027t want you to.\u0027 Genarr looked away. \u0027She never did.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s my father.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 Marlene hesitated. \u0027But I think she\u0027s wrong. If she could see you the way I do right now-\u0027 \u0027But she can\u0027t, unfortunately. It makes me so happy that you do, though. You\u0027re beautiful.\u0027 Marlene flushed. Then she said, \u0027You mean that!\u0027 \u0027Of course I do.\u0027 \u0027But-\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t lie to you, can I? So I won\u0027t try. Your face isn\u0027t beautiful. Your body isn\u0027t beautiful. But you are beautiful and that\u0027s what\u0027s important. And you can tell I really believe that.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 said Marlene, smiling with such genuine happiness that even her face had a sudden distant cast of beauty. Genarr smiled, too, and said, \u0027Shall we now talk about Commissioner Pitt? Now that I know what an uncommonly shrewd young woman you are, it is all the more important I do so. Are you willing?\u0027 Marlene clasped her hands lightly in her lap, smiled demurely, and said, \u0027Yes, Uncle Siever. You don\u0027t mind if I call you that, do you?\u0027 \u0027Not at all. In fact, I\u0027m honored. Now - tell me all about Commissioner Pitt. He has sent me instructions that I\u0027m to give your mother all possible cooperation and that I am to make freely available to her all our astronomical equipment. Why do you suppose that is?\u0027 \u0027My mother wants to make delicate measurements of Nemesis\u0027 motion relative to the stars, and Rotor is too unsteady a base for those measurements. Erythro will do much better.\u0027 \u0027Is this project of hers a recent one?\u0027 \u0027No, Uncle Siever. She\u0027s been trying to get the necessary data for a long time, she told me.\u0027 \u0027Then why didn\u0027t your mother ask to come here a long time ago?\u0027 \u0027She did, but Commissioner Pitt refused.\u0027 \u0027Why did he agree now?\u0027 \u0027Because he wanted to get rid of her.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure of that - if she kept bothering him with her astronomical problems. But he must have been tired of her a long time ago. Why does he send her now?\u0027 Marlene\u0027s voice was low. \u0027He wanted to get rid of me.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-14.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
