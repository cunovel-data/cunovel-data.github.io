{"id":70515,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"73\n Eugenia Insigna looked woebegone. \u0027Have you really decided to go out again, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027Mother,\u0027 said Marlene with weary patience, \u0027you make it sound as though I\u0027ve come to this decision five minutes ago after a long period of uncertainty. I\u0027ve been sure for a very long time that out there on Erythro is where I intend to be. I haven\u0027t changed my mind, and I won\u0027t change it.\u0027\n \u0027I know you\u0027re convinced that you\u0027re safe and I admit that nothing has happened to you so far, but-\u0027\n Marlene said, \u0027I feel safe on Erythro. I\u0027m drawn to it. Uncle Siever understands.\u0027\n Eugenia looked at her daughter, as if to object once again, but shook her head instead. Marlene\u0027s mind was made up, and she was not to be stopped.\n 74\n It\u0027s warmer on Erythro this time, Marlene thought, just warm enough to make the breeze welcome. The grayish clouds were scudding across the sky a bit more rapidly, and they seemed thicker.\n Rain was predicted for the next day, and Marlene thought it might be nice to be out in the rain and watch what happened. It should splash in the little creek and make the rocks wet and turn any soil muddy and mushy.\n She had come up to a flat rock near the creek. She brushed it with her hand, and sat down on it carefully, staring at the flowing water curling around the rocks that studded it, and thinking that the rain would feel like taking a shower.\n It would be like a shower coming down from the whole sky, so that you couldn\u0027t step out of it. A thought occurred to her: Will there be trouble breathing?\n No, that couldn\u0027t be. It rained on Earth all the time - frequently, anyway - and she didn\u0027t hear that people drowned in it. No, it would be like a shower. You could breathe in a shower.\n The rain wouldn\u0027t be hot, though, and she liked hot showers. She thought about it lazily. It was very quiet out here, and very peaceful, and she could rest and there was no-one to see her, to watch her, no-one whom she had to interpret. It was great not to have to interpret.\n What temperature would it be? The rain, that is. Why shouldn\u0027t it be the same comfortable temperature as Nemesis itself? Of course, she would get wet, and it was always cold when you stepped out of a shower all wet. And the rain would wet her clothes, too.\n But it would be silly to wear clothes in the rain. You didn\u0027t wear clothes in the shower. If it rained, you would take off your clothes. That would be the only thing that made sense.\n Only - where did you put the clothes? When you showered, you put your clothes in the cleaner. Here on Erythro, maybe you could put them under a rock, or have a little house built, in which you could leave your clothes on a rainy day. After all, why wear clothes at all if it were raining?\n Or if it were sunny?\n You\u0027d want to wear them if it were cold, of course. But on warm days-\n But then, why did people wear clothes on Rotor, where it was always warm and clean? They didn\u0027t at swimming pools - which reminded Marlene that the young people with slim bodies and good shapes were the first ones off with their clothes - and the last ones to put them on again.\n And people like Marlene just didn\u0027t take their clothes off in public. Maybe that\u0027s why people wore clothes. To hide their bodies.\n Why didn\u0027t minds have shapes you could show off? Except that they did, and then people didn\u0027t like it. People liked to look at shapely bodies and turned up their noses at shapely minds. Why?\n But here in Erythro with no people, she could take her clothes off whenever it was mild and be free of them. There\u0027d be no-one to point fingers or laugh at her.\n In fact, she could do whatever she wanted because she had a whole comfortable world, an empty world, an all-alone world, to surround her and envelop her like a huge soft blanket enclosing her and - just silence.\n She could feel herself letting go. Just silence. Her mind whispered it, so that even that would interfere as little as possible.\n Silence.\n And she sat upright. Silence?\n But she had come out to hear the voice again. And not scream this time. Not be afraid. Where was the voice?\n As though she had called it, as though she had whistled it up-\n \u0027Marlene!\u0027\n Her heart gave a little jump.\n She held herself firm. She mustn\u0027t make any sign of fright or disturbance. She simply looked around, and then said, very calmly, \u0027Where are you, please?\u0027\n \u0027It is not - necery - necessary to vi - vibrate the air - talk.\u0027\n The voice was Aurinel\u0027s, but it didn\u0027t speak like Aurinel at all. It sounded as though talking were difficult, but as though it would get better.\n \u0027It will get better,\u0027 said the voice.\n Marlene had not said anything. She did not say anything now. She merely thought the words-\u0027I don\u0027t have to talk. I only need to think.\u0027\n \u0027You only need to adjust the pattern. You\u0027re doing it.\u0027\n \u0027But I hear you talk.\u0027\n \u0027I am adjusting your pattern. It is as though you hear me.\u0027\n Marlene licked her lips gently. She must not allow herself to be frightened, to be anything but calm.\n \u0027There is nothing of which - whom - what to be frightened,\u0027 said the voice that was not quite Aurinel\u0027s voice.\n She thought, \u0027You hear everything, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Does that bother you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it does.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want you to know everything. I want some thoughts to myself.\u0027 (She tried not to think that that was how others might react to her, and want to keep their feelings private, but the thought, Marlene knew, would leak out, the moment she made the effort not to think it.)\n \u0027But your pattern is unlike the others.\u0027\n \u0027My pattern?\u0027\n \u0027The pattern of your mind. Others are - tangled - snarled. Yours is - splendid.\u0027\n Marlene licked her lips again and smiled. When her mind was sensed, it could be seen to be splendid. She felt triumphant and thought with contempt of the girls who had only - outsides.\n The voice in her mind said, \u0027Is that thought private?\u0027\n Marlene almost spoke aloud. \u0027Yes, it is.\u0027\n \u0027I can detect a distinction. I will not respond to your private thoughts.\u0027\n Marlene felt herself hungering for praise. \u0027Have you seen many patterns?\u0027\n \u0027I have sensed many, since you hu-man things came.\u0027\n It wasn\u0027t sure of the word, Marlene thought. The voice made no response and Marlene was surprised. The surprise had been a private sensation, now that she came to think of it, but she hadn\u0027t openly marked it to herself as private. Private was private whether she thought of it or not, perhaps. The mind had said it could detect the distinction, and it clearly could. It showed in the pattern.\n The voice didn\u0027t respond to that either. She would have to ask specifically, to show that it was not a private thought.\n \u0027Please, does it show in the pattern?\u0027 She didn\u0027t have to specify. The voice would know what she was talking about.\n \u0027It shows in the pattern. Everything shows in your pattern because it is so well designed.\u0027\n Marlene virtually purred. She had her praise. It would only be right to return the compliment. \u0027But your own must be well designed, too.\u0027\n \u0027It is different. My pattern stretches out. It is simple in every spot and is only complex when taken together. Yours is complex to start with. There is no simplicity in it. And yours is different from the others of your kind. The others are - snarled. It is not possible to cross-reach with them - to communicate. A rearrangement is damaging, for the pattern is fragile. I didn\u0027t know. My pattern is not fragile.\u0027\n \u0027Is my pattern fragile?\u0027\n \u0027No. It adjusts itself.\u0027\n \u0027You tried to communicate with others, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n The Erythro Plague. (There was no response. The thought was private.)\n She closed her eyes, reaching out intently with her mind, trying to locate the source of the outside mind reaching her. She was doing it in some way she did not understand, perhaps doing it all wrong, perhaps not doing it at all. The mind might laugh at her clumsiness - if it did such a thing as laugh.\n There was no response.\n Marlene thought, \u0027Think something.\u0027\n Inevitably, the thought came back, \u0027What shall I think?\u0027\n It did not come from anywhere. It did not come from here or there or elsewhere. It came from inside her mind.\n She thought (angered at her own insufficiency), \u0027When did you sense my mind pattern?\u0027\n \u0027On the new container of human beings.\u0027\n \u0027On Rotor?\u0027\n \u0027On Rotor.\u0027\n She was suddenly enlightened. \u0027You wanted me. You called me.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Of course. Why else had she so wanted to go to Erythro? Why else had she been looking at Erythro so longingly that day when Aurinel came to her to say her mother was looking for her?\n She clenched her teeth. She must continue asking, \u0027Where are you?\u0027\n \u0027Everywhere.\u0027\n \u0027Are you the planet?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Show yourself.\u0027\n \u0027Here.\u0027 And suddenly the voice had a direction.\n She was staring at the creek, and she suddenly realized that while she had been communicating with the voice in her mind, the creek had been the only thing she had been sensing. She had not been aware of anything else around her. It was as though her mind had enclosed itself, in order to make it more sensitive to the one thing that had filled it.\n And now the veil lifted. The water was moving along the rocks, bubbling over them, swirling in a small eddy in a space marked off by several of those bubbles. The small bubbles turned and broke, even as new ones formed, setting up a pattern that, in essence, didn\u0027t change, and in fine detail was never repeated.\n Then, one by one, the bubbles broke noiselessly and the water was flat and featureless, but still turned. How could she see it turn if it were featureless?\n Because it glistened very slightly in the pink light of Nemesis. It turned and she could see it turn because the shimmers formed arcs that spiraled as they turned and coalesced. Her eyes were caught in it, slowly following the turns as they collected into the caricature of a face, two dark holes for eyes, a slash for a mouth.\n It grew sharper, as she watched, fascinated.\n And it took on definition and became a face, staring up at her with empty eyes, yet real enough to recognize.\n It was the face of Aurinel Pampas.\n 75\n Siever Genarr said, thoughtfully and slowly, making an effort to treat the matter calmly, \u0027And so you left at that time.\u0027\n Marlene nodded. \u0027The time before I left when I heard Aurinel\u0027s voice. This time I left when I saw Aurinel\u0027s face.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t blame you-\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re humoring me, Uncle Siever.\u0027\n \u0027What should I do? Kick you? Let me humor you - if it pleases me. The mind, as you call it, picked up Aurinel\u0027s voice and his face from your mind, obviously. Those things must have been very clear in your mind. How close were you to Aurinel?\u0027\n She looked at him suspiciously. \u0027What do you mean? How close?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean anything terrible. Were you friendly?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Of course.\u0027\n \u0027Did you have a crush on him?\u0027\n Marlene paused and her lips pressed together. Then she said, \u0027I suppose I did.\u0027\n \u0027You use the past tense. Don\u0027t you any more?\u0027\n \u0027Well, what\u0027s the use? He just thinks of me as - a little girl. A kid sister, maybe.\u0027\n \u0027Not entirely an unnatural thought, under the circumstances. But you still think of him - which is why you\u0027ve conjured up his voice, and then his face.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean \"conjured up\"? It was a real voice and a real face.\u0027\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027\n \u0027Of course I am.\u0027\n \u0027Have you told your mother any of this?\u0027\n \u0027No. Not a word.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Uncle Siever. You know her. I couldn\u0027t stand all that - nervousness. I know. You\u0027re going to tell me it\u0027s all out of love, but that doesn\u0027t make it easier.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re willing to tell it to me, Marlene, and I\u0027m certainly very fond of you.\u0027\n \u0027I know that, Uncle Siever, but you\u0027re not the excitable type. You just look at things logically.\u0027\n \u0027Shall I take that as a compliment?\u0027\n \u0027I mean it as one.\u0027\n \u0027In that case, let\u0027s look at what you have found out, and do it logically.\u0027\n \u0027All right, Uncle Siever.\u0027\n \u0027Good. To begin with, there is something alive on this planet.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And it\u0027s not the planet itself.\u0027\n \u0027No, definitely not. He denied that.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s one living thing, apparently.\u0027\n \u0027I get the impression that he\u0027s one living thing. The trouble is, Uncle Siever, that what I get is not like telepathy is supposed to be. It\u0027s not like reading a mind and just getting talk. It\u0027s also impressions that come over you all at once, like looking at a whole picture instead of at the little bits of light and darkness that make it up.\u0027\n \u0027And the impression is of one living thing.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And intelligent.\u0027\n \u0027Very intelligent.\u0027\n \u0027But not technological. There is nothing technological that we\u0027ve ever found on the planet. This living thing that is not visible, not apparent, merely broods over the planet - thinks - reasons - but doesn\u0027t do anything. Is that it?\u0027\n Marlene hesitated. \u0027I can\u0027t quite tell, but maybe you\u0027re right.\u0027\n \u0027And then we came. When do you suppose that it became aware that we had come?\u0027\n Marlene shook her head. \u0027I couldn\u0027t say.\u0027\n \u0027Well, dear, it was aware of you while you were still on Rotor. It must have become aware of intelligence invading the Nemesian System when we were still quite a way off. Did you get that impression?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so, Uncle Siever. I think he didn\u0027t know about us until we landed on Erythro. That attracted his attention and then he looked around and found Rotor.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps you\u0027re right. Then it experimented with these new minds that it sensed on Erythro. They were the first minds not its own that it may have ever sensed. How long has it lived, Marlene? Any idea?\u0027\n \u0027Not really, Uncle Siever, but the impression I got is that he has lived a long time, maybe nearly as long as the planet.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe. In any case, however long it has lived, this was the first time it ever found itself immersed in many other rninds, far different from its own. Does that sound right to you, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027So it experimented with these new minds and because it knew so little about them, it damaged them. That was the Erythro Plague.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Marlene with sudden animation. \u0027He didn\u0027t say anything about the Plague directly, but the impression was strong. That original experimentation was the cause.\u0027\n \u0027And when it realized that it was causing damage, it stopped.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s why we don\u0027t have Erythro Plague now.\u0027\n \u0027And from that it would seem that this mind is benevolent, that it has a sense of ethics we can approve of, that it doesn\u0027t wish to harm other minds.\u0027\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 said Marlene with delight. \u0027I\u0027m sure of that.\u0027\n \u0027But what is this life-form? Is it a spirit? Something immaterial? Something beyond our senses?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t say, Uncle Siever,\u0027 sighed Marlene.\n Genarr said, \u0027Well, let me repeat what it told you. Stop me if I\u0027m wrong. It said its pattern \"stretches out\"; that it is \"simple in every spot and is complex only taken together\"; that it is \"not fragile\". Am I right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, you are.\u0027\n \u0027And the only life we have ever found on Erythro are the prokaryotes, the tiny bacterialike cells. If I don\u0027t want something that\u0027s spiritual and immaterial, I\u0027m stuck with those prokaryotes. Is it possible that those little cells, which seem separate, are actually part of one world-girdling organism? The mind pattern would then be stretched out. It would be simple in every spot and would be complex only when taken together. And it would not be fragile, for even if large sections of it were killed, the world organism would scarcely be touched as a whole.\u0027\n Marlene stared at Genarr. \u0027You mean I\u0027ve been talking to germs?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t say certainly, Marlene. It\u0027s only a hypothesis, but it fits beautifully and I can\u0027t think of anything else that would explain it as well. Besides, Marlene, if we looked at the hundred billion cells that make up your brain, each one of them, taken by itself, isn\u0027t really very much. You are an organism in which all the brain cells are clumped together. If you talk to another in which all the brain cells are separate and linked, let us say, by tiny radio waves, is that so very different?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Marlene, obviously disturbed. \u0027But let\u0027s ask another question, one that is very important. What does this life-form - whatever it is - want with you?\u0027\n Marlene looked startled. \u0027He can talk to me, Uncle Siever. He can transfer ideas to me.\u0027\n \u0027Your suggestion, then, is that it just wants someone to talk to? Do you suppose that once we humans came, it realized for the first time that it was lonely?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \u0027No impressions to that effect?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027It could destroy us.\u0027 Genarr was talking to himself now. \u0027It could destroy us without trouble if it grew tired of you, or bored with you.\u0027\n \u0027No, Uncle Siever.\u0027\n Genarr said, \u0027But it definitely hurt me when I wished to get in the way of your connection with the mind of the planet. It hurt Dr D\u0027Aubisson, your mother, and a guard.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but he hurt you all with only just enough force to stop you from interfering with me. He did no further damage.\u0027\n \u0027It goes to all these lengths to have you outside on the surface just so that it can talk to you, and have companionship. Somehow that doesn\u0027t seem to be enough of a reason.\u0027\n Marlene said, \u0027Perhaps the reason is something we can\u0027t understand. Perhaps he has so different a mind that he couldn\u0027t explain his reason, or, if he did, that it would make no sense to us.\u0027\n \u0027But its mind is not so different that it can\u0027t converse with you. It does receive ideas from you and transmit other ideas to you, doesn\u0027t it? You two do communicate.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And it understands you well enough to try to make itself seem pleasant to you by taking on Aurinel\u0027s voice and face.\u0027\n Marlene\u0027s head bent and she fixed her eyes on the floor in front of her.\n Genarr said softly, \u0027So since it understands us, we may be able to understand it, and, if so, you must find out why it wants you so. It could be very important to find that out, for who knows what it is planning? We have no way of finding out except through you, Marlene.\u0027\n Marlene was trembling. \u0027I don\u0027t know how to do that, Uncle Siever.\u0027\n \u0027Just do as you have been doing. The mind seems friendly to you, and it may explain.\u0027\n Marlene looked up and studied Genarr. She said, \u0027You\u0027re afraid, Uncle Siever.\u0027\n \u0027Of course. We\u0027re dealing with a mind far more powerful than ours. It may, if it decides it doesn\u0027t want us, do away with us all.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean that, Uncle Siever. You\u0027re afraid for me.\u0027\n Genarr hesitated. \u0027Are you still sure that you\u0027re safe on Erythro, Marlene? Are you safe talking to this mind?\u0027\n Marlene rose to her feet and said, almost haughtily, \u0027Of course I am. There is no risk. He will not hurt me.\u0027\n She sounded supremely confident, but Genarr\u0027s heart sank. What she thought scarcely counted, for her mind had been adjusted by the mind of Erythro. Could he trust her now? he wondered.\n After all, why should this mind built up of prokaryotes in their trillion trillion not have an agenda of its own, as, for instance, Pitt had? And why shouldn\u0027t this mind in its anxiety to fulfill that agenda, show all the duplicity of Pitt?\n In short, what if the mind were lying to Marlene for reasons of its own?\n Was he right to send Marlene out to that mind under such conditions?\n But did it matter whether he was right or not? Had he a choice? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-34.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
