{"id":70487,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"10 Insigna sat there, deeply surprised at herself. She had never told the story to anyone, though she had lived with it almost every day for fourteen years. She had never dreamed of telling it to anyone. She had assumed that she would take it to the grave with her. Not that it was disgraceful in any way - merely private. And here she had told it - at length and without reserve - to her adolescent daughter, to someone who, until the moment she had begun talking, she had considered a child - a peculiarly hopeless child. And that child now looked at her solemnly, out of her dark eyes - unblinking, owlishly adult, somehow - and finally said, \u0027Then you did drive him away, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027In a way, yes. But I was furious. He wanted to take you. To Earth.\u0027 She paused, then said tentatively, \u0027You understand?\u0027 Marlene asked, \u0027Did you want me so much?\u0027 Insigna said indignantly, \u0027Certainly!\u0027 And then, under the calm gaze of those eyes, she stopped to think the unthinkable. Had she really wanted Marlene? But then she calmly said, \u0027Of course. Why wouldn\u0027t I?\u0027 Marlene shook her head and, for a moment, there was that sullen look on her face. \u0027I think I probably wasn\u0027t a charming baby. Perhaps he wanted me. Were you unhappy because he wanted me more than he wanted you? Did you keep me just because he wanted me?\u0027 \u0027What horrible things you\u0027re saying. That\u0027s not it at all,\u0027 said Insigna, not at all sure whether she believed that or not. There was getting to be no comfort in discussing these things with Marlene. More and more, Marlene was developing this dreadful way of cutting under the skin. Insigna had noticed this before and had put it down to the occasional lucky blows of an unhappy child. But it was happening more and more often, and Marlene now seemed to be wielding the scalpel deliberately. Insigna said, \u0027Marlene. What made you think I had driven your father away? I had never said so, surely, or given you any reason to think so, have I?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t really know how I know things, Mother. Sometimes you mention Father to me, or to someone else, and you always sound as though there\u0027s something you regret, something you wish you could do over.\u0027 \u0027There is? I never feel that.\u0027 \u0027And little by little, as I get these impressions, they get clearer. It\u0027s the way you talk, the way you look-\u0027 Insigna gazed at her daughter intently, then said very suddenly, \u0027What am I thinking?\u0027 Marlene jumped slightly and then gave a short giggle. She was not a laugher, and that giggle was as far as ever she went - usually. She said, \u0027That\u0027s easy. You\u0027re thinking that I know what you\u0027re thinking, but you\u0027re wrong. I don\u0027t read minds. I just tell from words and sounds and expressions and movements. People just can\u0027t keep what they think hidden. And I\u0027ve watched them so long.\u0027 \u0027Why? I mean, why have you felt it necessary to watch them?\u0027 \u0027Because when I was a kid, everyone lied to me. They told me how sweet I was. Or they told you that when I was listening. They always had a look plastered all over them that said, \"I don\u0027t really think that at all.\" And they didn\u0027t even know it was there. I couldn\u0027t believe at first they didn\u0027t know. But then I said to myself, \"I guess it\u0027s more comfortable for them to make believe they\u0027re telling the truth.\" \u0027 Marlene paused and then abruptly asked her mother, \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell Father where we were going?\u0027 \u0027I couldn\u0027t. It was not my secret.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps if you had, he would have come with us.\u0027 Insigna shook her head vigorously. \u0027No, he wouldn\u0027t. He had made up his mind to return to Earth.\u0027 \u0027But if you had told him, Mother, Commissioner Pitt wouldn\u0027t have let him leave, would he? Father would have known too much.\u0027 \u0027Pitt wasn\u0027t Commissioner then,\u0027 said Insigna with absent irrelevance. Then, with sudden vigor, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have wanted him on those terms. Would you?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t tell how he would have been if he had stayed.\u0027 \u0027But I can tell.\u0027 Insigna felt as though she were burning again. Her mind went back to that last conversation and her last wild shout telling Fisher to go, that he must go. No, it had been no mistake. She wouldn\u0027t have wanted him as a prisoner, an enforced member of Rotor. She hadn\u0027t loved him that much. For that matter, she hadn\u0027t hated him that much either. And then she changed the subject quickly, allowing no time for her expression to give her away. \u0027You upset Aurinel this afternoon. Why did you tell him Earth would be destroyed? He came to me about that and was very concerned.\u0027 \u0027All you had to do was to tell him that I was just a kid and no-one listens to what a kid says. He would have believed that right away.\u0027 Insigna ignored that. Maybe it was a good idea to say nothing in order to avoid the truth. \u0027Do you really think Earth will be destroyed?\u0027 \u0027I do. You talk about Earth sometimes. You say, \"Poor Earth.\" You almost always say, \"Poor Earth.\" \u0027 Insigna felt herself flush. Did she really speak of Earth in those terms? She said, \u0027Well, why not? It\u0027s overcrowded, worn-out, full of hatred and famines and miseries. I\u0027m sorry for the world. Poor Earth.\u0027 \u0027No, Mother. You don\u0027t say it that way. When you say it-\u0027 Marlene held up her hand in a groping gesture, feeling for something, her fingertips just missing it. \u0027Well, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s clear in my mind, but I don\u0027t know how to put it in words.\u0027 \u0027Keep on trying. I must know.\u0027 \u0027The way you say it, I can\u0027t help but think you feel guilty - as though it were your fault.\u0027 \u0027Why? What do you think I\u0027ve done?\u0027 \u0027I heard you say it once when you were in the view room. You looked at Nemesis, and it seemed to me, then, that Nemesis was mixed up in it. So I asked the computer what Nemesis meant and it told me. It\u0027s something that relentlessly destroys, something that inflicts retribution.\u0027 \u0027That wasn\u0027t the reason for the name,\u0027 cried Insigna. \u0027You named it,\u0027 said Marlene quietly, inexorably. That was no secret, of course, any longer, once they had left the Solar System behind them. Insigna had then taken the credit for the discovery and for the name. \u0027It\u0027s because I named it that I know that that wasn\u0027t the reason for the name.\u0027 \u0027Then why do you feel guilty, Mother?\u0027 (Silence - if you don\u0027t want to tell the truth.) Insigna said at last, \u0027How do you think Earth will be destroyed?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, but I think you know, Mother.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re speaking at cross-purposes, Marlene, and let\u0027s let it go for now. What I want, though, is to make sure you understand that you are not to talk about any of this to anyone - not about your father, and not about this nonsense of Earth\u0027s destruction.\u0027 \u0027If you don\u0027t want me to, of course I won\u0027t, but the destruction bit is not nonsense.\u0027 \u0027I say it is. We\u0027ll define it as nonsense.\u0027 Marlene nodded. \u0027I think I\u0027ll go view for a while,\u0027 she said with seeming indifference. \u0027Then I\u0027ll go to bed.\u0027 \u0027Good!\u0027 Insigna watched her daughter leave. Guilty, thought Insigna. I feel guilty. I wear it on my face like a bright banner. Anyone who looks can see it. No, not anyone. Just Marlene. She has the gift of doing so. Marlene had to have something to compensate for all she didn\u0027t get. Intelligence wasn\u0027t enough. It didn\u0027t make up sufficiently, so she had this gift of reading expression, intonation, and otherwise invisible bodily twitches, so that no secret was safe from her. How long had she kept this dangerous attribute to herself? How long had she known about it? Was it something that grew stronger with age? Why did she allow it to emerge now, to peep out from behind the curtain she seemed to have drawn over it, and to use it as something with which to beat her mother? Was it because Aurinel had rejected her, finally and definitely, according to what she had seen in him? Was she striking out blindly in consequence? Guilty, thought Insigna. Why shouldn\u0027t I feel guilty? It is all my fault. I should have known from the start, from the instant of discovery - but I didn\u0027t want to know.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-6.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies. One of the colonies, Rotor, has broken away from the solar system to create its own renegade utopia around an unknown red star two light-years from Earth: a star named Nemesis.
