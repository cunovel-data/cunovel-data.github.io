{"id":70498,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"32\n Adelia was a pleasant Settlement, much more pleasant than Rotor had been.\n Crile Fisher had now been on six Settlements other than Rotor and all had been more pleasant than Rotor. (Fisher paused momentarily to go over the list of names and sighed. There were seven, not six. He was losing track. Perhaps it was all getting to be too much for him.)\n Whatever the number, Adelia was the most pleasant Settlement Crile had visited. Not perhaps physically. Rotor had been an older Settlement, one that had managed to work itself into an assembly of traditions, so to speak. There was an efficiency about it, a sense of each person knowing his place exactly, being satisfied with it, and working away at it successfully.\n Of course, Tessa was here on Adelia - Tessa Anita Wendel. Crile had not pursued matters there yet, perhaps because Tanayama\u0027s characterization of him as irresistible to women had shaken him. However much it might have been meant as humor (or as sarcasm), it forced him, almost against his will, to go slowly. Producing a fiasco would seem doubly bad in the eyes of someone who believed him, however insincerely, to have a way with women.\n It was two weeks after Fisher had settled himself into the Settlement before he managed to see her. It was always a source of wonder to him that on any Settlement one could always manage to arrange to get a view of anyone. Not all his experience had accustomed him to the smallness of a Settlement, to the fewness of its population, to the manner in which everyone knew everyone else in his or her social circle - everyone else - and almost everyone else outside that circle, too.\n When he did see her, however, Tessa Wendel turned out to be rather impressive. Tanayama\u0027s description of her as middle-aged and as twice-divorced - the quirk of his aged lips as he said so, as though he were knowingly setting Fisher an unpleasant task - had built a picture in Fisher\u0027s mind of a harsh woman, hard-faced, with a nervous twitch, perhaps, and an attitude toward men that was either cynical or hungry.\n Tessa did not seem at all like this from the moderate distance at which he first saw her. She was almost as tall as he was and brunette, with her hair sleeked down. She looked quite alert and she smiled easily - he could tell that. Her clothes were refreshingly simple, as though she went out of her way to eschew ornament. She had kept herself slim and her figure was still surprisingly youthful.\n Fisher found himself wondering why she was twice-divorced. He was ready to assume that she had tired of the men, rather than the other way around, even though common sense told him that incompatibility could strike against all odds.\n It was necessary to be at some social function at which she would also be present. His being an Earthman interposed a small difficulty, but there were people on every Settlement who were, to some extent or other, in Earth\u0027s pay. One of them would surely see to it that Fisher would be \u0027launched\u0027, to use the term most Settlements applied to the ritual.\n The time came, then, when he and Wendel were facing each other and she gazed at him thoughtfully, her eyes making a slow sweep downward, then upward again, followed by the inevitable, \u0027You\u0027re from Earth, aren\u0027t you, Mr Fisher.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I am, Dr Wendel. And I regret that exceedingly - if it offends you.\u0027\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t offend me. I presume you\u0027ve been decontaminated.\u0027\n \u0027Indeed. To death, just about.\u0027\n \u0027And why have you dared the decontamination process in order to come here?\u0027\n And Fisher said, without staring at her too directly, but keen to detect the effect, \u0027Because I was told that Adelian women were particularly beautiful.\u0027\n \u0027And now, I suppose, you will go back and deny the rumor.\u0027\n \u0027On the contrary, it has just been confirmed.\u0027\n She said, \u0027You\u0027re a fetcher, you know that?\u0027\n Fisher didn\u0027t know what a \u0027fetcher\u0027 was in Adelian slang, but Wendel was smiling, and Fisher decided the first exchange had gone well.\n Was it because he was irresistible? He suddenly remembered that he had never tried to be irresistible to Eugenia. He had merely wanted a way of being launched into the difficult Rotorian society.\n The Adelian society was not so difficult, Fisher decided, but he had better not belabor his irresistibility.\n Yet to himself, he smiled sadly.\n 33\n A month later, Fisher and Wendel were sufficiently at ease with each other to spend some time together in a low-G gym. Fisher had almost enjoyed the workout - but only almost, because he had never grown sufficiently acclimated to gymnastics at low-G to avoid a certain amount of space sickness. On Rotor, there had been less attention to such things, and he had usually been excluded from them because he was not a native Rotorian. (That was not legal, but custom often has a habit of being stronger than legality.)\n They took an elevator to a higher-G level, and Fisher felt his stomach settling down. Both he and Wendel were wearing a minimum of clothing, and he had the feeling that she was as aware of his body as he was of hers.\n After their showers, they had both robed and retired to one of the Privacies, where they could order a small meal.\n Wendel said, \u0027You\u0027re not bad at low-G for an Earth-man, Crile. Are you enjoying yourself on Adelia?\u0027\n \u0027You know I am, Tessa. An Earthman can never get entirely used to a small world, but your presence would overbalance a great many disadvantages.\u0027\n \u0027Yes. That\u0027s exactly what a fetcher would say. How does Adelia compare to Rotor?\u0027\n \u0027To Rotor?\u0027\n \u0027Or to the other Settlements you\u0027ve been on? I can name them all, Crile.\u0027\n Fisher felt discomfited. \u0027What did you do? Investigate me?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n \u0027Am I that interesting?\u0027\n \u0027I find anyone interesting who is clearly going out of his way to be interested in me. I want to know why. Excluding the possibility of sex, of course. That\u0027s taken as a given.\u0027\n \u0027Why am I interested in you, then?\u0027\n \u0027Suppose you tell me. Why were you on Rotor? You were there long enough to get married and have a child and then you got off in a hurry before it scooted away. Were you afraid of being stuck on Rotor all your life? Didn\u0027t you like it there?\u0027\n Fisher had gone from feeling discomfited to feeling harassed. He said, \u0027Actually, I didn\u0027t like Rotor very much because they didn\u0027t like me - Earthmen, that is. And you\u0027re right. I didn\u0027t want to be stuck there as a second-class citizen all my life. Other Settlements are easier on us. Adelia is.\u0027\n \u0027Rotor had a secret, though, that it was trying to keep from Earth, didn\u0027t it?\u0027 Wendel\u0027s eyes seemed to glitter with amusement.\n \u0027A secret? You mean, I suppose, hyper-assistance.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I suppose that is what I mean. And I suppose that that was what you were after.\u0027\n \u0027I?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, of course you. Did you get it? I mean, that\u0027s why you married a Rotorian scientist, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 She rested her face on her two fists, elbows on the table, and leaned toward him.\n Fisher shook his head, and said guardedly, \u0027She never said a word to me about hyper-assistance. You\u0027re all wrong about me.\u0027\n Wendel ignored his remark, and said, \u0027And now you want to get it from me. How do you plan to do that? Are you going to marry me?\u0027\n \u0027Would I get it from you if I married you?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Then marriage seems to be out of the question, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Too bad,\u0027 said Wendel, smiling.\n Fisher said, \u0027Are you asking me these questions because you\u0027re a hyperspatialist?\u0027\n \u0027Where were you told that that was what I was? Back on Earth, before you came here?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re listed in the Adelian Roster.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, you\u0027ve investigated me, too. What a curious pair we are. Did you notice that I was listed as a theoretical physicist?\u0027\n \u0027It also lists your papers, and when quite a few of the titles have the word \"hyperspatial\", it makes you sound like a hyperspatialist to me.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but I\u0027m a theoretical physicist just the same, so I approach the whole matter of hyperspatialism in a theoretical way. I\u0027ve never tried to put it into practice.\u0027\n \u0027But Rotor did. Did that bother you? I wonder. After all, someone on Rotor got ahead of you.\u0027\n \u0027Why should it bother me? The theory is interesting, but the application isn\u0027t. If you were to read more of my papers than the titles, you would discover that I say, quite flatly, that hyper-assistance isn\u0027t worth the effort.\u0027\n \u0027Rotorians were able to get a vessel far into space and studied the stars.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re talking about the Far Probe. That enabled Rotor to get parallax measurements for a number of comparatively distant stars, but is that worth the expense they went to? How far did the Far Probe go? Just a few light-months. That\u0027s not really very far. As far as the Galaxy is concerned, the Far Probe\u0027s extreme position and that of Earth and the imaginary line that can be drawn between them all amounts to a point in space.\u0027\n \u0027They did more than send out the Far Probe,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027The entire Settlement left.\u0027\n \u0027They certainly did. That was in \u002722, so they\u0027ve been gone six years now. And all we know is that they left.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t that enough?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not. Where did they go? Are they still alive? Can they still be alive? Human beings have never been isolated on a Settlement. They have always had Earth in the vicinity, and other Settlements, too. Can a few tens of thousands of human beings survive, alone in the Universe, on a small Settlement? We have no idea if that is a psychological possibility. My guess is that it isn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027I imagine their purpose would be to find a world they could live on. They wouldn\u0027t remain on a Settlement.\u0027\n \u0027Come, what world will they find? They\u0027ve been gone six years. There are exactly two stars they could have reached by now since hyper-assistance can only move them at an average speed equal to that of light. That\u0027s Alpha Centauri, a three-star system, four-point-three light-years away, one of the three being a red dwarf. Then there\u0027s Barnard\u0027s star, a single red dwarf, five-point-nine light-years away. Four stars: a Sun-like star, a near-Sun-like star, and two red dwarfs. The two Sun-likes are part of a moderately close binary and therefore unlikely to have an Earth-like planet in stable orbit. Where do they go next? They won\u0027t make it, Crile. I\u0027m sorry. I know that your wife and child were on Rotor, but they won\u0027t make it.\u0027\n Fisher kept calm. He knew something she didn\u0027t. He knew about the Neighbor Star - but that was a red dwarf, too.\n He said, \u0027Then you think that interstellar flight is impossible?\u0027\n \u0027In a practical sense, yes, if hyper-assistance is all there is.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027You make it sound as though hyper-assistance isn\u0027t all there is, Tessa.\u0027\n \u0027It may be all there is. It wasn\u0027t long ago when we thought that even that much was impossible and to go further yet-Still, we can at least dream of true hyperspatial flight and true superluminal velocities. If we could go as quickly as we wished for as long as we wished, then the Galaxy, perhaps the Universe, would become one large Solar System, so to speak, and we could have it all.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s a nice dream, but is it possible?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ve had three All-Settlement Conferences on the matter since Rotor\u0027s flight.\u0027\n \u0027Just All-Settlement? What about Earth?\u0027\n \u0027There were Earth observers present, but Earth is not a physicists\u0027 paradise these days.\u0027\n \u0027What conclusions did the conference reach?\u0027\n Wendel smiled. \u0027You\u0027re not a physicist.\u0027\n \u0027Leave out the hard parts. I\u0027m curious.\u0027\n She merely smiled at him.\n Fisher clenched his fist on the table before him. \u0027Forget this theory of yours that I\u0027m some sort of secret agent after your information. I have a child out there somewhere, Tessa. You say she\u0027s probably dead. What if she\u0027s alive? Is there a chance-\u0027\n Wendel\u0027s smile disappeared. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. I did not think of that. But be practical. Finding a Settlement somewhere in a volume of space that is represented by a sphere that, at the present time, is six light-years in radius and is growing ever larger with time is an impossible task. It took us over a century to find the tenth planet, and that was enormously larger than Rotor and a much smaller volume of space had to be combed.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027Hope springs eternal. Is true hyperspatial flight possible? You can say yes or no.\u0027\n \u0027Most say no - if you want the truth. There may be a few who say they can\u0027t say, but they tend to mumble.\u0027\n \u0027Does anyone say yes right out loud?\u0027\n \u0027One person that I know of does. I do.\u0027\n \u0027You think it\u0027s possible?\u0027 said Fisher with an astonishment he did not have to fake. \u0027Do you say that openly, or is it something you tell yourself in the dark of the night?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve published on the subject. One of those articles you only read the title of. No-one dares agree with me, of course, and I\u0027ve been wrong before, but I think I\u0027m right now.\u0027\n \u0027Why do the others all think you\u0027re wrong?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the hard part. It\u0027s a matter of interpretation. Hyper-assistance on the Rotorian model, the techniques of which are by now understood in the Settlements generally, by the way, depends on the fact that the product of the ratio of ship speed to light speed, multiplied by time, is a constant, where the ratio of ship speed to light speed is greater than one.\u0027\n \u0027What does that mean?\u0027\n \u0027That means that when you go faster than light, the faster you go, the shorter the time you can maintain the speed, and the longer the time you must go more slowly than light before you can get a boost over it again. The result is that, in the end, your average speed over a particular distance is no greater than the speed of light.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027\n \u0027That makes it sound as though the uncertainty principle is involved, and the uncertainty principle, all of us are convinced, can\u0027t be fooled with. If the uncertainty principle is involved, then true hyperspatial flight would seem to be theoretically impossible, and most physicists have come down on that side of the argument, while the rest of them waffle. My view, however, is that what\u0027s involved merely seems like the uncertainty principle but isn\u0027t, and that true hyperspatial flight is, therefore, not eliminated.\u0027\n \u0027Can the matter be settled?\u0027\n \u0027Probably not,\u0027 said Wendel, shaking her head. \u0027The Settlements are definitely not interested in wandering off with mere hyper-assistance. No-one is going to repeat the Rotorian experiment and voyage for years to probable death. On the other hand, neither is any Settlement going to invest an incredible amount of money, resources and effort in order to try to work out a technique that the vast majority of experts in the field are convinced is theoretically impossible.\u0027\n Fisher leaned forward, \u0027Doesn\u0027t that bother you?\u0027\n \u0027Of course it bothers me. I\u0027m a physicist and I\u0027d like to prove that my view of the Universe is the correct one. However, I\u0027ve got to accept the limits of the possible. It will take enormous sums and the Settlements will give me nothing.\u0027\n \u0027But, Tessa, even if the Settlements are not interested, Earth is - and to any amount.\u0027\n \u0027Really?\u0027 Tessa smiled in what seemed mild amusement and she reached out to stroke Fisher\u0027s hair, slowly and sensually. \u0027I thought we\u0027d get to Earth eventually.\u0027\n 34\n Fisher seized Wendel\u0027s wrist and gently drew her hand away from his head. He said, \u0027You\u0027ve been telling me the truth about your opinions of hyperspatial flight, haven\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Completely.\u0027\n He said, \u0027Then Earth wants you.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because Earth wants hyperspatial flight, and you\u0027re the one important physicist who thinks it can be done.\u0027\n \u0027If you knew that, Crile, why the cross-examination?\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know it until you told me so. The only information I had been given was that you were the most brilliant physicist alive today.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I am, I am,\u0027 said Wendel mockingly. \u0027And you were sent to get me?\u0027\n \u0027I was sent to persuade you.\u0027\n \u0027Persuade me to do what? To come to Earth? Overcrowded, filthy, impoverished, wracked by uncontrolled weather. What an enticing thought.\u0027\n \u0027Listen to me, Tessa. Earth is not all of a piece. It may have all those faults, but there are parts that are beautiful and peaceful and that is all you would see. You don\u0027t really know what Earth is like. You\u0027ve never been there, have you?\u0027\n \u0027Never. I\u0027m Adelian, born and bred. I have been to other Settlements, but I\u0027ve never been to Earth, thank you.\u0027\n \u0027Then you can\u0027t know what Earth is like. You can\u0027t know what a large world is. A real world. You live here enclosed, in a toy box, with a few square kilometers of surface, with a handful of people. You\u0027re living in a miniature that you\u0027ve used up long ago and that has nothing more to offer you. Earth, on the other hand, is over six hundred million square kilometers of surface. It is eight billion human beings. It is infinite variety - lots of it very bad, but lots of it very good.\u0027\n \u0027And all of it very poor. And you have no science.\u0027\n \u0027Because scientists - and with them science - have moved out to the Settlements. That\u0027s why we need you and others. Come back to Earth.\u0027\n \u0027I still don\u0027t see why.\u0027\n \u0027Because we have goals, ambitions, desires. The Settlements have only self-satisfaction.\u0027\n \u0027What good are all those goals and ambitions and desires? Physics is an expensive pursuit.\u0027\n \u0027And Earth\u0027s per capita wealth is low, I admit it. Individually, we are poor, but eight billion people, each contributing something out of poverty, can amass a vast sum. Our resources, misused as they are and have been, are still enormous, and we can find more money and more labor than all the Settlements together - if it is for something we feel an absolute need. I assure you that Earth feels an absolute need for hyperspatial flight. Come to Earth, Tessa, and you will be treated as that rarest of resources, a brilliant brain we must have - and the one thing we can\u0027t supply on our own.\u0027\n Wendel said, \u0027I\u0027m not at all sure that Adelia would be willing to let me go. It may be a self-satisfied Settlement, but it knows the value of brains, too.\u0027\n \u0027They can\u0027t object to your attending a scientific meeting on Earth.\u0027\n \u0027And once there, you mean, I needn\u0027t return?\u0027\n \u0027You will have no complaint with regard to treatment. You will be more comfortable there than you are here. Your every desire, your every wish- More than that, you can head the hyperspatial project and you will have an unlimited budget to devise tests of any kind, run experiments, make observations-\u0027\n \u0027Well! What a princely bribe you offer me!\u0027\n Fisher said earnestly, \u0027Is there anything more you can ask for?\u0027\n \u0027I wonder,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027Why were you sent? An attractive man like you? Were they expecting you to bring back an elderly female physicist - susceptible - frustrated - drawn by your body like a fish by a hook?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what was in the mind of those who sent me, Tessa, but that was not in my mind. Not after one look at you. You are not elderly, as you well know. I don\u0027t for a minute believe that you are either susceptible or frustrated. Earth is offering you a physicist\u0027s dream. That has nothing to do with whether you are male or female, elderly or youthful.\u0027\n \u0027What a shame! Suppose I proved recalcitrant and didn\u0027t wish to go to Earth? What were you to do as a last measure of persuasion? Suppress your distaste for the process and make love to me?\u0027\n Wendel crossed her arms over her magnificent breasts and looked at him quizzically.\n Fisher said carefully, choosing his words, \u0027Again, I cannot say what was in the mind of those who sent me. Making love was not part of my explicit instructions, nor was it part of my intentions, though if it had been, I assure you that I would feel no distaste at the prospect. I felt, however, that you would see the advantages from a physicist\u0027s point of view and I would not denigrate you by supposing that you would need anything more.\u0027\n \u0027How wrong you are,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027I see the advantages from a physicist\u0027s point of view, and I am anxious to accept the offer and to pursue the butterfly of hyperspatial flight down the corridors of the possible - but I do not wish to give up your best efforts at persuasion either. I want it all.\u0027\n \u0027But-\u0027\n \u0027In short, if you want me, you must pay me. Persuade me as though I were recalcitrant, as best as ever you can, or I won\u0027t go to Earth. Come, why do you suppose we are here in a Privacy? What do you think Privacies are for? Once we have exercised, showered, eaten a bit, drank a little, conversed, experienced some pleasure in all these things, there is opportunity to experience others. I insist. Persuade me to come to Earth.\u0027\n And at the touch of her finger, the light within the Privacy dimmed seductively. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-17.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
