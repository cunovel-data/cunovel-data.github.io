We live on a huge world, but I\u0027m bounded by the Dome. The people here tend to be ingrown. When I do meet someone interesting, they leave in a couple of months, at most. Generally, the people here in the Dome bore me most of the time, though probably not as much as I bore them. That\u0027s why the arrival of you and your daughter would have been a holovision item, even if you were anyone else. Of course, since it\u0027s you-\u0027\n \u0027Flatterer,\u0027 said Insigna sadly.\n Genarr cleared his throat. \u0027Marlene warned me, for my own good, you understand, that you have not quite gotten over-\u0027\n But Insigna overrode him suddenly. \u0027I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve noticed any holovision attention.\u0027\n Genarr gave up. He said, \u0027Just a manner of speaking. We\u0027re planning a little party tomorrow evening, and you\u0027ll then be formally introduced and everyone will get a chance to know you.\u0027\n \u0027And discuss my appearance, and choice of costume, and chew over whatever is known about me.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sure of it. But Marlene will be invited, too, and that means, I suppose, that you will know a great deal more about all of us than we will about you. Your information will be more reliable, too.\u0027\n Insigna looked uneasy, \u0027Did Marlene act up?\u0027\n \u0027You mean, did she read my body language? Yes, ma\u0027am.\u0027\n \u0027I told her not to.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think she can help it.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re right. She can\u0027t. But I told her not to tell you about it. I take it she did tell you.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes. I ordered her to do so. Actually, I commanded her to do so in my role as Commander.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m sorry. It can be so annoying.\u0027\n \u0027But it wasn\u0027t. Not to me. Eugenia, please understand this. I like your daughter. I like her very much. I have the idea that she has had a miserable life being someone who knows too much and whom no-one likes. That she has turned out full of what you referred to as the unlovable virtues is little short of a miracle.\u0027\n \u0027I warn you. She\u0027ll tire you out. And she\u0027s only fifteen.\u0027\n Genarr said, \u0027There\u0027s some law, I think, that prevents mothers from ever remembering when they themselves were fifteen. She casually mentioned a boy, and you may know that the pangs of unrequited love hurt as deeply at fifteen as at twenty-five, maybe even more so. Though your teenage years may well have been sunny ones, considering your appearance. Remember, too, that Marlene is in a particularly bad position. She knows she\u0027s plain and she knows she\u0027s intelligent. She feels that intelligence should much more than make up for lack of beauty and she also knows that it doesn\u0027t, so she rages helplessly and knows that that does no good either.\u0027\n \u0027Well, Siever,\u0027 said Insigna, trying to sound light, \u0027you\u0027re quite the psychologist.\u0027\n \u0027No, not at all. It\u0027s just this one thing I understand. I\u0027ve been through it myself.\u0027\n \u0027Oh-\u0027 Insigna seemed at a loss.\n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Eugenia. I have no intention of being sorry for myself, and I wasn\u0027t trying to lure you into sympathy for a poor, broken soul - because I\u0027m not. I\u0027m forty-nine, not fifteen, and I\u0027ve made my peace with myself. Had I been handsome and stupid when I was fifteen, or twenty-one, as, at that time in life, I wished I had been, I would undoubtedly now no longer be handsome - but I\u0027d still be stupid. So, in the long run, I\u0027ve won out, and so, I\u0027m positive, will Marlene - if there is a long run.\u0027\n \u0027And what do you mean by that, Siever?\u0027\n \u0027Marlene tells me that she talked to our good friend Pitt, and that she deliberately antagonized him in order to make him willing to send you to Erythro because that meant getting rid of her, too.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t approve of that,\u0027 said Eugenia. \u0027I don\u0027t mean about manipulating Pitt, because I don\u0027t think Pitt is that easy to manipulate. I mean trying to do it. Marlene is getting to the point where she thinks she can pull puppet strings, and this may get her into serious trouble.\u0027\n \u0027Eugenia, I do not wish to frighten you, but I think Marlene is in serious trouble right now. At least, it may be Pitt\u0027s hope that she will be.\u0027\n \u0027Now, Siever, that\u0027s impossible. Pitt may be opinionated and overbearing, but there\u0027s nothing vicious about him. He\u0027s not going to strike out at a teenage girl just because she played foolish games with him.\u0027\n The dinner was over, but the lights were still somewhat lowered in Genarr\u0027s rather elegant quarters, and Insigna reacted with a slight frown as Genarr leaned over to close the contact that activated the shield. \u0027Secrets, Siever?\u0027 she said with a forced laugh. \u0027Yes, as a matter of fact, Eugenia. I\u0027m going to have to play the psychologist again. You don\u0027t know Pitt as I do. I\u0027ve competed with him, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m out here. He wanted to get rid of me. In my case, however, separation is enough. It may not be enough in Marlene\u0027s case.\u0027\n Another forced laugh. \u0027Come, Siever. What are you saying?\u0027\n \u0027Listen, and you\u0027ll understand. Pitt is secretive. He has a fixed aversion to anyone knowing what he intends. It gives him a sense of power to be moving down a hidden road and dragging others, all unwitting, with him.\u0027\n \u0027You may be right. He kept Nemesis secret, and forced the secrecy on me, too.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s got many secrets, more than you and I know, I\u0027m sure. But here\u0027s Marlene, to whom a person\u0027s hidden motives and thoughts are as clear as day. No-one likes that - Pitt, least of all. So he\u0027s sent her out here - and you, too, since he couldn\u0027t send her without you.\u0027\n \u0027All right. What of that?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t suppose he wants her back, do you? Ever?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s paranoid, Siever. You can\u0027t really believe Pitt would intend to keep her in permanent exile.\u0027\n \u0027He can, in one way. You see, Eugenia, you don\u0027t know the early history of the Dome as I do, and as Pitt does, and as hardly anyone else does. You know Pitt\u0027s penchant for secrecy and it works here, too. You have to understand why we remain in the Dome and make no effort to colonize Erythro.\u0027\n \u0027You explained. The character of the light-\u0027\n \u0027That is the official explanation, Eugenia. Accept the light; it is something we can grow accustomed to. Consider what else we have: a world with a normal gravity, a breathable atmosphere, a pleasant temperature range, weather cycles reminiscent of Earth, no life-forms above the prokaryote stage, and with those prokaryotes not infectious in any way. Yet we make no move to colonize the world, even in a limited fashion.\u0027\n \u0027Well, then, why not?\u0027\n \u0027In the early days of the Dome, people went out freely to explore outside. They took no special precautions, breathed the air, drank the water.\u0027\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n \u0027And some of them fell ill. Mentally. Permanently. Not violently insane, but - divorced from reality. Some have improved with time, but none, as far as I know, has recovered completely. It is, apparently, not contagious, and they are taken care of on Rotor - quietly.\u0027\n Eugenia frowned. \u0027Are you making this up, Siever? I haven\u0027t heard a word of it.\u0027\n \u0027I remind you again of Pitt\u0027s penchant for secrecy. This was not something you had a need to know. It was not your department. It was something I had a need to know because I was sent here to deal with it. If I failed, we might have had to abandon Erythro altogether, and a pall of fear and discontent would have fallen over us all.\u0027 He fell silent for a moment, then said, \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be telling you this. I am, in a sense, violating my oath of office. Still, for Marlene\u0027s sake-\u0027\n A look of deepest apprehension crossed Eugenia\u0027s face. \u0027What are you saying? That Pitt-\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m saying that Pitt may have thought that Marlene might come down with what we called \"Erythrotic Plague.\" It wouldn\u0027t kill her. It wouldn\u0027t even make her ill in the ordinary sense, but it would sufficiently disorder her brain to put her peculiar gift out of action, perhaps, and that is what Pitt would want.\u0027\n \u0027But that is horrible, Siever. Unthinkable. To subject a child-\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not saying it will happen, Eugenia. What Pitt wants is not necessarily what Pitt will get. Once I got here, I introduced drastic methods of protection. We don\u0027t go out in the open, except in the equivalent of protective suits, and we don\u0027t stay out longer than need be. The filtration procedures of the Dome have been improved, too. Since I instituted those measures, we\u0027ve only had two cases, both rather light.\u0027\n \u0027But what causes it, Siever?\u0027\n Genarr laughed briefly but not lightly. \u0027We don\u0027t know. That\u0027s the worst of it. We can\u0027t sharpen our defenses any further. Careful experiments indicate that there is nothing in either air or water that would seem to account for it. Nor in the soil - after all, we have the soil here in the Dome; we can\u0027t divorce ourselves from it. We have the air and water, too, properly filtered. Still, many people have breathed raw Erythrotic air and drunk raw Erythrotic water and have done so with complete impunity and no consequences.\u0027\n \u0027Then it must be the prokaryotes.\u0027\n \u0027It can\u0027t be. We\u0027ve all ingested them or breathed them inadvertently, and we\u0027ve used them in animal experiments. Nothing happens. Besides, if it were the prokaryotes, the Plague would be expected to be contagious and, as I said, it isn\u0027t. We\u0027ve experimented with the radiation from Nemesis and that seems to do no harm. What\u0027s more, once - only once - someone who\u0027d never been outside got it inside the Dome. It\u0027s a mystery.\u0027\n \u0027You have no theories?\u0027\n \u0027I? No. I\u0027m just content that it has virtually stopped. Still, as long as we are so ignorant of the nature and cause of the Plague, we can never be sure that it won\u0027t start up again. There was one suggestion-\u0027\n \u0027What was that?\u0027\n \u0027A psychologist reported this suggestion to me and I passed it on to Pitt. He claimed that those who came down with the disorder were more imaginative than those who did not, more out of the ordinary, mentally speaking. More intelligent, more creative, more unusual. He suggested that whatever the cause, the more remarkable brains were less resistant, more easily upset.\u0027\n \u0027Do you think that might be so?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. The trouble is that there is no other distinction. Both sexes were hit, roughly equally, and no clear bias as far as age, education, or gross physical characteristics could be found. Of course, the Plague victims make up a relatively small sample, so the statistics aren\u0027t compelling. Pitt thought we might go along with the out-of-the-usual bit, and, in recent years, no-one has come to Erythro who hasn\u0027t been a pretty dull clod - not intelligent, you understand, but a plodder. Like myself. I\u0027m the ideal subject for immunity from the Plague, an ordinary brain. Right?\u0027\n \u0027Come, Siever, you aren\u0027t-\u0027\n \u0027On the other hand,\u0027 said Genarr, not waiting for her protest, \u0027I would say that Marlene\u0027s brain was remarkably out of the ordinary.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 began Eugenia. \u0027I see what you\u0027re getting at.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s possible that when Pitt discovered that Marlene had this ability and that she was asking to go to Erythro, he saw at once that by merely acceding to her request, he might possibly get rid of a mind he instantly recognized as dangerous.\u0027\n \u0027Obviously, then, we ought to leave - go back to Rotor.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but I\u0027m quite sure Pitt can prevent that for a while. He can insist that these measurements you wish to make are vital and must be completed and you won\u0027t be able to use the Plague as an excuse. If you even try, he will have you held for mental examination. I would suggest that you complete those measurements as quickly as you can, and, as for Marlene, we will take all possible precautions. The Plague has died down, and the suggestion that out-of-the-ordinary brains are particularly vulnerable is just that, a suggestion, and no more. There\u0027s no real reason to think we can\u0027t get away with it. We can keep Marlene safe and do Pitt in the eye. You\u0027ll see.\u0027\n Insigna stared at Genarr, not quite seeing him, her stomach tying itself into a knot. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-16.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
