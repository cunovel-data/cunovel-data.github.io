He said, \u0027You\u0027re her mother, Eugenia, and you can\u0027t help but think of her as a little girl. It takes a while for a mother to realize she is not an absolute monarch, that her daughter is not a piece of property.\u0027 Eugenia Insigna avoided his mild eye. She said, \u0027Don\u0027t lecture me, Siever. You have no children of your own. It\u0027s easy to be pompous about other people\u0027s children.\u0027 \u0027Do I sound pompous? I\u0027m sorry. Let us say, I\u0027m not as emotionally bound as you are to the memory of an infant. I like the girl a great deal, but I have no picture of her in my mind except that of a burgeoning young woman with a very remarkable mind. She\u0027s important, Eugenia. I have a peculiar feeling that she is much more important than either you or I. She must be consulted-\u0027 \u0027She must be kept safe,\u0027 Insigna countered. \u0027I agree, but she must be consulted as to how best to keep her safe. She is young, she is inexperienced, but she may possibly know better than we do what must be done. Let us talk among ourselves as though we were three adults. Promise me, Eugenia, that you won\u0027t try to make use of maternal authority.\u0027 Insigna said bitterly, \u0027How can I promise that? But we\u0027ll talk to her.\u0027 So now the three were together in Genarr\u0027s office, the room shielded, and Marlene, looking quickly from one to the other, pressed her lips tightly together and said unhappily, \u0027I\u0027m not going to like this.\u0027 Insigna said, \u0027I\u0027m afraid it is bad news. Here it is - bluntly. We\u0027re considering a return to Rotor.\u0027 Marlene looked astonished. \u0027But your important work, Mother. You can\u0027t abandon that. But I see you don\u0027t intend to. I don\u0027t understand, then.\u0027 \u0027Marlene,\u0027 Insigna spoke slowly and with emphasis. \u0027We\u0027re considering that you return to Rotor. Only you.\u0027 At that, there were a few moments of silence, while Marlene searched both of their faces. Then she said, almost in a whisper, \u0027You\u0027re serious. I can\u0027t believe it. I won\u0027t return to Rotor. I don\u0027t want to. Ever. Erythro is my world. Right here is where I want to be.\u0027 \u0027Marine-\u0027 began Insigna, her voice shrill. Genarr held up his hand in Insigna\u0027s direction, shaking his head slightly. She fell silent, and Genarr said, \u0027Why are you so anxious to be here, Marlene?\u0027 And Marlene answered flatly, \u0027Because I am. You can be hungry for some particular food sometimes - just feel like eating it. You can\u0027t explain why. You just want it. I\u0027m hungry for Erythro. I don\u0027t know why, but I want it. I don\u0027t have to explain that.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Let your mother tell you what we know.\u0027 Insigna took Marlene\u0027s cold and unresponsive hand in hers and said, \u0027Do you remember, Marlene, before we left for Erythro, when you were telling me about your conversation with Commissioner Pitt-\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027You told me then that when he said we could go to Erythro, he left out something. You didn\u0027t know what that something was, but you said it was rather unpleasant - sort of evil.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I remember.\u0027 Insigna hesitated and Marlene\u0027s large penetrating eyes grew hard. She whispered, as though she was talking to herself and wasn\u0027t entirely aware that her inner thoughts were being voiced. \u0027Optic flicker at head. Hand nearly at temple. Moves away.\u0027 The sound died, though her lips continued to move. Then, in loud outrage, she said, \u0027Are you under the impression there\u0027s something wrong with my mind?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Insigna quickly. \u0027Quite the reverse, dear. We know that your mind is an excellent one, and we want it to stay that way. Here\u0027s the story-\u0027 Marlene listened to the tale of the Erythro Plague with what seemed to be the deepest suspicion, and finally said, \u0027I see you believe what you are telling me, Mother, but it could be that someone told you a lie.\u0027 \u0027She heard it from me,\u0027 said Genarr, \u0027and I tell you, of my personal experience, that it\u0027s all the truth. Now you tell me if I am telling the truth right now.\u0027 Marlene clearly accepted that and moved onward. \u0027Why am I in particular danger, then? Why am I in danger more than you or Mother?\u0027 \u0027As your Mother said, Marlene- The Plague is thought to strike more readily at people who are more imaginative, more fanciful. There is evidence that leads some to believe that unusual minds are more susceptible to the Plague, and since yours is the most unusual I have ever encountered, it seems to me possible that you are dangerously susceptible. The Commissioner has sent instructions that you are to have a free hand on Erythro, that we\u0027re to make it possible for you to see and experience whatever you wish, that we are even to allow you to explore outside the Dome - if that is your desire. It sounds very kind of him, but might he not want to expose you to the outside in the wish, in the hope, of increasing your chance at coming down with the Plague?\u0027 Marlene considered this with no sign of emotion. Insigna said, \u0027Don\u0027t you see, Marlene? The Commissioner doesn\u0027t want to kill you. We\u0027re not accusing him of that. He just wants to put your mind out of action. It is inconvenient to him. You can easily find out things about him and about his intentions that he doesn\u0027t want you to know, and he won\u0027t have that. He\u0027s a man of secrets.\u0027 \u0027If Commissioner Pitt is trying to do me harm,\u0027 said Marlene at length, \u0027then why are you trying to send me back to him?\u0027 Genarr raised his eyebrows. \u0027We\u0027ve explained it. You\u0027re in danger here.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d be in danger there, with him. What might he do next - if he really wants to destroy me? If he thinks I\u0027m going to be destroyed here, then he\u0027ll forget about me. He\u0027ll leave me alone, won\u0027t he? At least for as long as I\u0027m here?\u0027 \u0027But the Plague, Marlene. The Plague.\u0027 She reached out to hug her. Marlene evaded the embrace. \u0027I\u0027m not worried about the Plague.\u0027 \u0027But we explained-\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what you explained. I\u0027m not in danger here. Not at all. I know my mind. I\u0027ve lived with it all my life. I understand it. It\u0027s not in danger.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Be reasonable, Marlene. However stable you feel your mind to be, it\u0027s subject to disease and deterioration. You might get meningitis, epileptic symptoms, a brain tumor, or, eventually, senescence. Can you hold any of those things at bay just by being sure none of it will happen to you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not talking about any of those things. I\u0027m talking about the Plague. That won\u0027t happen to me.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t possibly be sure, dear. We don\u0027t even know what the Plague is.\u0027 \u0027Whatever it is, it won\u0027t happen to me.\u0027 \u0027How can you tell, Marlene?\u0027 asked Genarr. \u0027I just know,\u0027 Insigna felt her patience break. She caught Marlene by both elbows. \u0027Marlene, you must do as you\u0027re told.\u0027 \u0027No, Mother. You don\u0027t understand. On Rotor, I\u0027ve felt a pull toward Erythro. It pulls me more strongly than ever, now that I\u0027m on it. I want to stay on it. I\u0027ll be safe here. I don\u0027t want to go back to Rotor. I\u0027ll be less safe there.\u0027 Genarr raised his hand, stopping whatever it was that Insigna was about to say. \u0027I suggest a compromise, Marlene. Your mother is here to make certain astronomical observations. It will take her some time. Promise that, while she is busy at it, you will be content to stay inside the Dome and take such precautions as I think will make sense, and that you submit to periodic tests. If we detect no change in your mental functioning, you can wait here in the Dome till your mother is done and then we can discuss it again. Agreed?\u0027 Marlene bent her head in thought. Then she said, \u0027All right. But, Mother, don\u0027t think of pretending to be finished when you\u0027re not finished. I will know. And don\u0027t think of doing a quick job instead of a good one. I will know that, too.\u0027 Insigna frowned and said, \u0027I won\u0027t play games, Marlene, and don\u0027t think I will ever deliberately do bad science - even for your sake.\u0027 Marlene said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Mother. I know that you find me irritating.\u0027 Insigna sighed heavily. \u0027I don\u0027t deny that, but irritating or not, Marlene, you are my daughter. I love you, and I want to keep you safe. As far as that goes, am I lying?\u0027 \u0027No, Mother, you are not lying, but please believe me when I say I am safe. Since I\u0027ve been on Erythro, I\u0027ve been happy. I never was happy on Rotor.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027And why are you happy?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, Uncle Siever. But being happy is enough, even when you don\u0027t know why, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 36 \u0027You look tired, Eugenia,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027Not physically, Siever. Just tired inside after two months of calculations. I don\u0027t know how it was possible for astronomers in prespatial times to do what they did with nothing more than primitive computers. For that matter, Kepler worked out the laws of planetary motion with nothing more than logarithms, and had to consider himself fortunate that they had just been invented.\u0027 \u0027Pardon a nonastronomer, but I thought that these days, astronomers simply gave their instruments their directions, then went to sleep and, after a few hours, woke up and found everything printed up neatly and waiting at the desk.\u0027 \u0027I wish. But this job was different. Do you know how precisely I had to calculate the actual velocity of Nemesis and the Sun relative to each other, so that I could know exactly where and when the two made their closest approach? Do you know how tiny an error would be sufficient to make it seem that Nemesis would do Earth no harm when it would really destroy it - and vice versa?\u0027 \u0027It would be bad enough,\u0027 Insigna went on intensely, \u0027if Nemesis and the Sun were the only two bodies in the Universe, but there are nearby stars, all of them moving. At least a dozen of them are massive enough to have a tiny effect on Nemesis or the Sun or both. Tiny, but large enough to mount up to an error of millions of kilometers one way or another, if ignored. And in order to get it right, you have to know the mass of each star with considerable precision, and its position, and its velocity.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a fifteen-body problem, Siever, enormously complicated. Nemesis will go right through the Solar System and have a perceptible effect on several of the planets. A lot depends on the actual position of each planet in its orbit as Nemesis passes through, of course, and by how much it will shift under the influence of Nemesis\u0027 gravity, and how this shift will affect its pull on the other planets. And, by the way, the effect of Megas also has to be calculated.\u0027 Genarr listened gravely, \u0027And what\u0027s the bottom line, Eugenia?\u0027 \u0027As it happens, I believe the effect will be to make Earth\u0027s orbit a trifle more eccentric than it is now and the semimajor axis a bit smaller than it is now.\u0027 \u0027Which means?\u0027 \u0027Which means that Earth will become too hot to be habitable.\u0027 \u0027And what will happen to Megas and Erythro?\u0027 \u0027Nothing measurable. The Nemetic System is much smaller than the Solar System and therefore is held together more tightly. Nothing here will budge significantly, but Earth will.\u0027 \u0027When will this happen?\u0027 \u0027In five thousand and twenty-four years, plus or minus fifteen, Nemesis will reach the point of closest approach. The effect will spread itself out over twenty or thirty years as Nemesis and the Sun approach and separate.\u0027 \u0027Are there going to be any collisions or anything like that?\u0027 \u0027Almost zero chance of anything significant. No collisions between any major bodies. Of course, a solar asteroid might strike Erythro, or a Nemetic asteroid might strike the Earth. There would be a very small chance of that, though it would be catastrophic for Earth if it happened. There\u0027s no chance of calculating that, however, until the stars are very close to each other.\u0027 \u0027But, in any case, Earth will have to be evacuated. Is that it?\u0027 \u0027Oh yes.\u0027 \u0027But they\u0027ve got five thousand years to do it in.\u0027 \u0027Five thousand years is none too long to arrange for the evacuation of eight billion people. They should be warned.\u0027 \u0027Won\u0027t they find out for themselves, even if they aren\u0027t warned?\u0027 \u0027Who knows when? And even if they find out soon, we should give them the technique of hyper-assistance. They will have to have it.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure they will have that on their own, too, and perhaps in not too long a time.\u0027 \u0027And if they don\u0027t?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m also sure that within a century or less, communication will be established between Rotor and Earth. After all, if we have hyper-assistance for transportation, we will have it for communication eventually. Or we will send a Settlement back to Earth and there will still be time.\u0027 \u0027You talk like Pitt.\u0027 Genarr chuckled. \u0027He can\u0027t be wrong all the time, you know.\u0027 \u0027He won\u0027t want to communicate. I know it.\u0027 \u0027He can\u0027t always have his way either. We have a Dome here on Erythro, though he opposed it. And even if we don\u0027t beat him on that, hell be dead eventually. Really, Eugenia, don\u0027t worry excessively about Earth at this moment. We have nearer concerns. Does Marlene know you are about done?\u0027 \u0027How can she fail to know? Apparently, the exact state of my progress is imprinted on the way I swish my sleeve or comb my hair.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s getting ever more perceptive, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Have you noticed that, too?\u0027 \u0027Indeed I have. Just in the short time I\u0027ve known her.\u0027 \u0027I suppose part of it is due to her growing older. She\u0027s growing perception, perhaps, the way she\u0027s growing breasts. Then, too, she spent most of her life trying to hide her ability because she didn\u0027t know what to make of it, and because it got her into trouble. Now that she\u0027s not afraid, it\u0027s out and expanding, so to speak.\u0027 \u0027Or because, for some reason, as she says, she likes being on Erythro and her pleasure extends her perceptions.\u0027 Insigna said, \u0027I have had a thought about this, Siever. I don\u0027t wish to pester you with my follies. I do tend to accumulate worries about Marlene, about Earth, about everything- Do you suppose that Erythro is affecting her? I mean, adversely? Do you suppose that a touch of the Plague is taking the form of making her even more perceptive?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know that that question can be answered, Eugenia, but if her heightened perception is the effect of the Plague, it doesn\u0027t seem to bother her mental balance at all. And I can tell you this - none of those who suffered from the Plague in all our stay here showed any symptoms remotely like Eugenia\u0027s gift.\u0027 Insigna heaved a sigh. \u0027Thank you. You\u0027re comforting. And thank you, too, for being so gentle and friendly with Marlene.\u0027 Genarr\u0027s mouth quirked in a small lopsided smile. \u0027It\u0027s easy. I\u0027m very fond of her.\u0027 \u0027You make that sound so natural. She\u0027s not a likable girl. I know that, even if I\u0027m her mother.\u0027 \u0027I find her likable. I\u0027ve always preferred brains to beauty in women - unless I could get both, as in your case, Eugenia-\u0027 \u0027Twenty years ago, maybe,\u0027 said Eugenia with another sigh. \u0027My eyes have aged with your body, Eugenia. They see no change. But it doesn\u0027t matter to me that Marlene is not beautiful. She\u0027s fearfully intelligent, even apart from her perception.\u0027 \u0027Yes, there is that. It consoles me even when she is most burdensome.\u0027 \u0027Well, as to that, I\u0027m afraid Marlene will continue to be a burden, Eugenia.\u0027 Insigna looked up sharply. \u0027In what way?\u0027 \u0027She has made it plain to me that being in the Dome is not enough. She wants to be out there, out on the soil of the world itself just as soon as you are done with your work. She insists!\u0027 And Insigna stared at him in horror.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-18.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
