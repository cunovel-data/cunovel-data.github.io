More than that.\n \u0027I tell you, Siever, I haven\u0027t had a good night\u0027s sleep since you took her out in the aircraft.\u0027 Her voice degenerated into what, in a woman of less firm character, might almost have been described as a whine. \u0027Wasn\u0027t the flight through air - off to the ocean and back, and coming back after nightfall, too - wasn\u0027t that enough for her? Why don\u0027t you stop her?\u0027\n \u0027Why don\u0027t I stop her?\u0027 said Siever Genarr slowly, as though he were tasting the question. \u0027Why don\u0027t I stop her? Eugenia, we have gotten past the stage of being able to stop Marlene.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous, Siever. It\u0027s almost cowardly. You\u0027re hiding behind her, pretending she\u0027s all-powerful.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t she? You\u0027re her mother. Order her to stay in the Dome.\u0027\n Insigna\u0027s lips compressed. \u0027She\u0027s fifteen. I don\u0027t like to be tyrannical.\u0027\n \u0027On the contrary. You would love to be tyrannical. But if you try, she\u0027ll look at you out of those clear extraordinary eyes of hers and say something like, \"Mother, you feel guilty of having deprived me of my father, so you feel that the Universe is conspiring to deprive you of me as punishment, and that\u0027s a silly superstition.\" \u0027\n Insigna frowned. \u0027Siever, that is the stupidest thing I\u0027ve ever heard. I don\u0027t feel any such thing, and couldn\u0027t possibly.\u0027\n \u0027Of course you don\u0027t. I was just making something up. But Marlene won\u0027t be. She\u0027ll know, from the twitching of your thumb or the movement of your shoulder blade or something, just what is bothering you, and she\u0027ll tell you, and it will be so true, and so shameful, I suppose, that you will be too busy looking for ways to defend yourself, and you\u0027ll give in to her rather than have her keep peeling away the outer layers of your psyche.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t tell me that\u0027s what\u0027s happened to you.\u0027\n \u0027Not much because she\u0027s fond of me, and I\u0027ve tried to be very diplomatic with her. But if I cross her, I shudder to think what a shambles she\u0027ll make of me. Look, I\u0027ve managed to delay her. Give me credit for that. She wanted to go out immediately after the plane trip. And I held her off to the end of the month.\u0027\n \u0027How did you do that?\u0027\n \u0027Pure sophistry, I assure you. It\u0027s December. I told her that, in three weeks, the New Year would begin, at least if we go by Earth Standard time, and how best to celebrate the beginning of 2237, I asked her, than to begin the new era of the exploration and settlement of Erythro? You know, she views her own penetration of the planet in that light - as the beginning of a new age. Which makes it worse.\u0027\n \u0027Why worse?\u0027\n \u0027Because she doesn\u0027t view it as a personal caprice, but as something of vital importance to Rotor, or even to humanity, perhaps. There\u0027s nothing like satisfying your personal pleasure and calling it a noble contribution to the general welfare. It excuses everything. I\u0027ve done it myself, so have you, so has everyone. Pitt, more than anyone else whom I know, does it. He has probably convinced himself that he breathes only to contribute carbon dioxide to the plant life of Rotor.\u0027\n \u0027So, by playing on her megalomania, you had her wait.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, and it still gives us one more week to see if anything will stop her. I might say, though, that my plea didn\u0027t fool her. She agreed to wait, but she said, \"You think that if you delay me, you will win your way at least a little bit into the affections of my mother, don\u0027t you, Uncle Siever? There\u0027s nothing about you that indicates you consider the coming of the new year of the slightest importance.\" \u0027\n \u0027How unbearably rude, Siever.\u0027\n \u0027Merely unbearably correct, Eugenia. Same thing, perhaps.\u0027\n Insigna looked away. \u0027My affections? What can I say-\u0027\n Genarr said quickly, \u0027Why say anything? I\u0027ve told you I loved you in the past, and I find that getting old - or getting older - hasn\u0027t much changed it. But that\u0027s my problem. You\u0027ve never treated me unfairly. You never gave me reason to hope. And if I\u0027m fool enough not to be able to take no for an answer, what concern is that of yours?\u0027\n \u0027It concerns me that you\u0027re unhappy for any reason.\u0027\n \u0027That counts for a lot right there.\u0027 Genarr managed a smile. \u0027It\u0027s infinitely better than nothing.\u0027\n Insigna looked away and, with obvious deliberation, returned to the topic of Marlene. \u0027But, Siever, if Marlene saw your motivation, why did she agree to the delay?\u0027\n \u0027You won\u0027t like this, but I\u0027d better tell you the truth. Marlene said, \"I\u0027ll wait till the New Year, Uncle Siever, because perhaps that will please Mother, and I\u0027m on your side.\" \u0027\n \u0027She said that?\u0027\n \u0027Please don\u0027t hold it against her. I have obviously fascinated her with my wit and charm and she thinks she\u0027s doing you a favor.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s a matchmaker,\u0027 said Insigna, obviously caught between annoyance and amusement.\n \u0027It did occur to me that if you could bring yourself to show an interest in me, we could use that to persuade her into all sorts of things that she would think would further encourage the interest - except that it would have to be real or she would see through it. And if it were real, she wouldn\u0027t feel it necessary to make sacrifices to bring about what was already so. Do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027I understand,\u0027 said Insigna, \u0027that if it weren\u0027t for Marlene\u0027s perceptiveness, you would be positively Machiavellian in your approach to me.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve got me dead to rights, Eugenia.\u0027\n \u0027Well, why not do the obvious thing? Lock her up and, eventually, carry her on to the rocket back to Rotor.\u0027\n \u0027Bound hand and foot, I suppose. Aside from not thinking we could do such a thing, I\u0027ve managed to catch Marlene\u0027s vision. I\u0027m beginning to think of colonizing Erythro - a whole world for the taking.\u0027\n \u0027And breathing their alien bacteria, getting them into our food and water.\u0027 Insigna\u0027s face curled into a grimace.\n \u0027What of it? We breathe, drink, and eat them - to an extent - right here. We can\u0027t keep them out of the Dome altogether. For that matter, there are bacteria on Rotor that we breathe, drink, and eat, too.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but we\u0027re adapted to Rotor\u0027s life. These are alien bits of life.\u0027\n \u0027All the safer. If we\u0027re not adapted to them, neither are they to us. There are no signs they can possibly parasitize us. They would simply be so many innocuous dust particles.\u0027\n \u0027And the Plague.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the real difficulty, of course, even in the case of something as simple as letting Marlene go outside the Dome. We will, of course, take precautions.\u0027\n \u0027What kind of precautions?\u0027\n \u0027She would wear a protective suit, for one thing. For another, I\u0027ll go out with her. I\u0027ll serve as her canary.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean, \"canary\"?\u0027\n \u0027It was a device they had on Earth some centuries back. Miners carried canaries - you know, little yellow birds - into mines. If the air went bad, the canary died before the men were affected, but the men, knowing there was a problem, would get out of the mine. In other words, if I begin to act queerly, we\u0027ll both be brought in at once.\u0027\n \u0027But what if it affects her before it affects you?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think it will. Marlene feels immune. She\u0027s said that so many times that I have begun to believe her.\u0027\n 55\n Eugenia Insigna had never before watched the New Year approaching with such a painful concentration on the calendar. There had never been reason before. For that matter, the calendar was a vestigial hangover, twice removed.\n On Earth, the year had begun by marking the seasons, and the holidays that related to the seasons - midsummer, midwinter, sowing, harvest - by whatever names they were called.\n Crile (Insigna remembered) had explained the intricacies of the calendar to her, and had reveled in them in his dark and solemn way, as he did in everything that reminded him of Earth. She had listened to him with a mixture of ardor and apprehension; ardently because she wished to share his interest, as that might draw them closer together; apprehensively because she feared his interest in Earth might drive him away from her, as eventually it did.\n Strange that she still felt the pang - but was it dimmer now? It seemed to her that she could not actually remember Crile\u0027s face, that she remembered only the remembering now. Was it only the memory of a memory that stood between her and Siever Genarr now?\n And yet it was the memory of a memory that held Rotor to the calendar now. Rotor had never had seasons. It had the year, of course, for it (and all the Settlements in the Earth-Moon system, which left out only those few that circled Mars or that were being built in the asteroid belt) accompanied Earth on its path around the Sun. Still, without seasons, the year was meaningless. Yet it was kept together with months and weeks.\n Rotor had the day, too, fixed artificially at twenty-four hours during which sunlight was allowed to enter for half the time and blocked off for the other half. It could have been fixed for any length of time, but it was fixed at the length of an Earth day and divided into twenty-four hours of sixty minutes each, with each minute consisting of sixty seconds. (The days and nights were at least uniformly twelve hours long.)\n There had been occasional movements among the Settlements to adopt a system of merely numbering days and grouping them into tens and multiples of tens; into dekadays, hectodays, kilodays, and, in the other direction, decidays, centidays, millidays; but that was really impossible.\n The Settlements could not set up each their own system for that would have reduced trade and communications to chaos. Nor was any unified system possible save that of Earth, where 99 per cent of the human population still lived, and to which ties of tradition still held the remaining 1 per cent. Memory held Rotor and all the Settlements to a calendar that was intrinsically meaningless for them.\n But now Rotor had left the Solar System and was a world that was isolated and alone. No day, or month, or year in the Earthly sense existed. It was not even sunlight that marked day from night, for Rotor gleamed with artificial daylight and darkened to a light whisper twelve hours on and twelve hours off. The harsh precision was not even broken by the gradual dimming and brightening at the boundaries that might simulate twilight and dawn. There seemed to be no need. And within this all-Settlement division, individual homes kept their illumination on and off to suit their whims or needs, but counted the days by Settlement time - which was Earth time.\n Even here at the Erythro Dome, where there was a natural day and night that was casually used as such by those in occupation, it was the not-quite-matching Settlement day length, still tied to that of Earth (the memory of a memory), that was used in official calculations.\n The movement was now stronger to leave the day as the only basic measure of time. Insigna knew for a fact that Pitt favored the decimalization of time measure, and yet even he hesitated to suggest it officially, for fear of rousing wild opposition.\n But perhaps not for ever. The traditional disorderly units of weeks and months seemed less important. The traditional holidays were more frequently ignored. Insigna, in her astronomical work, used days as the only significant units. Someday the old calendar would die, and, in the far unseen future, new methods of agreed-upon time marking would surely arise - a Galactic Standard calendar, perhaps.\n But now she found herself marking off the time to a New Year that began arbitrarily. On Earth, at least the New Year began at the time of a solstice - winter in the northern hemisphere, summer in the southern. It had a relationship to Earth\u0027s orbit around the Sun that only the astronomers on Rotor remembered clearly.\n But now - even though Insigna was an astronomer - the New Year had to do only with Marlene\u0027s venture on to the surface of Erythro - a time chosen by Siever Genarr only because it involved a plausible delay, and accepted by Insigna only because she was officiously concerning herself with a teenager\u0027s notion of romance.\n Insigna came out of her roaming through the depths of thought to find Marlene regarding her solemnly. (When had she entered the room so silently, or was Insigna so tied into an inner knot as to be unaware of footsteps?)\n Insigna said in half a whisper, \u0027Hello, Marlene.\u0027\n Marlene said solemnly, \u0027You\u0027re not happy, Mother.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t have to be superperceptive to see that, Marlene. Are you still determined to step out on Erythro?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Entirely. Completely.\u0027\n \u0027Why, Marlene, why? Can you explain it so I can understand?\u0027\n \u0027No, because you don\u0027t want to understand. It\u0027s calling me.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s calling you?\u0027\n \u0027Erythro is. It wants me out there.\u0027 Marlene\u0027s ordinarily glum face seemed suffused with a furtive happiness.\n Insigna snapped, \u0027When you talk like that, Marlene, you simply give me the impression that you are already infected by the - the-\u0027\n \u0027The Plague? I\u0027m not. Uncle Siever has just had another brain scan taken of me. I told him he didn\u0027t have to, but he said we had to have it for the record before we left. I\u0027m perfectly normal.\u0027\n \u0027Brain scans can\u0027t tell you everything,\u0027 said Insigna, frowning.\n Marlene said, \u0027Neither can a mother\u0027s fears.\u0027 Then, more softly, \u0027Mother, please, I know you want to delay this, but I won\u0027t accept a delay. Uncle Siever has promised. Even if it rains, even if it\u0027s bad weather, I\u0027m going out. At this time of the year, there are never real storms or temperature extremes. There are almost never at any time of the year. It\u0027s a wonderful world.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s barren - dead. Except for germs,\u0027 Insigna said spitefully.\n \u0027But someday we\u0027ll put life of our own upon it.\u0027 Marlene looked away, her eyes lost in dreaming. \u0027I\u0027m sure of it,\u0027 she said.\n 56\n \u0027The E-suit is a simple suit,\u0027 said Siever Genarr. \u0027It doesn\u0027t have to withstand pressure. It\u0027s not a diving suit or a a spacesuit. It has a helmet, and it has a compressed air supply that can be regenerated, and a small heat-exchange unit that keeps the temperature comfortable. And it\u0027s airtight, obviously.\u0027\n \u0027Will it fit me?\u0027 asked Marlene, looking at the display of thickish pseudo-textile material with distaste.\n \u0027Not fashionably so,\u0027 said Genarr, his eyes twinkling. \u0027It isn\u0027t made for beauty, but for use.\u0027\n Marlene said in a slightly exasperated tone, \u0027I\u0027m not interested in looking beautiful, Uncle Siever, but I don\u0027t want to be slopping around in it. If it makes walking hard, it won\u0027t be worth it.\u0027\n Eugenia Insigna interrupted. She had been watching, a little white-faced and pinch-lipped. \u0027The suit is necessary to protect you, Marlene. I don\u0027t care how sloppy it is.\u0027\n \u0027But it doesn\u0027t have to be uncomfortable, Mother, does it? If it happens to fit, it would protect me just the same.\u0027\n \u0027This will fit fairly well, actually,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027It\u0027s the best we could find. After all, we only have them in adult sizes.\u0027 He turned his head toward Insigna. \u0027We don\u0027t use them much these days. There was a time after the Plague died down that we did some exploring, but by now we know the immediate surroundings quite well, and on the rare occasions we do go out, we tend to use enclosed E-cars.\u0027\n \u0027I wish you\u0027d use an enclosed E-car now.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Marlene, obviously pained at the suggestion, \u0027I\u0027ve been out in a vehicle. I want to walk. I want to - feel the ground.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re mad,\u0027 said Insigna discontentedly.\n Marlene fired back, \u0027Will you stop implying-\u0027\n \u0027Where\u0027s your perceptivity? I wasn\u0027t referring to the Plague. I mean just plain mad, just mad in the ordinary sense. I mean- Please, Marlene, you\u0027re driving me mad, as well.\u0027\n She then said, \u0027Siever, if these are old E-suits, how do you know they don\u0027t leak?\u0027\n \u0027Because we\u0027ve tested them, Eugenia. I assure you they\u0027re in good working order. Remember, I\u0027m going out with her, and also in a suit.\u0027\n Insigna was clearly seeking objections. \u0027And suppose you suddenly have to-\u0027 She waved her hand meaning-lessly.\n \u0027Urinate? Is that what you mean? That can be taken care of, though it\u0027s not comfortable. Still, it won\u0027t arise. We\u0027ve emptied our bladders and we\u0027re good for several hours - or should be. And we\u0027re not venturing far off, so in case of emergency, we can come back to the Dome. We ought to leave now, Eugenia. Conditions are good outside and we should take advantage of that. Here, Marlene, let me help you with your suit.\u0027\n Insigna said sharply, \u0027Don\u0027t sound so happy.\u0027\n \u0027Why not? To tell you the truth, I would like to step out myself. The Dome can easily start to feel like a prison, you know. Maybe if we all stepped out more, our people could endure longer shifts in the Dome. There you are, Marlene, we only have to fit on the helmet, now.\u0027\n Marlene hesitated. \u0027Just a minute, Uncle Siever.\u0027 She walked toward Insigna, holding out her arm, suited and bulky.\n Insigna gazed at her mournfully.\n \u0027Mother,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027Once again, please be calm. I love you and I wouldn\u0027t do this and cause you such anxiety just to please myself. I do it only because I know I will be fine and that you need not be anxious. And I bet you want to get into an E-suit also, so you can come out and never lose sight of me, but you mustn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Why mustn\u0027t I, Marlene? How will I forgive myself if something happens to you and I\u0027m not there to help you?\u0027\n \u0027But nothing will happen to me. And even if something does, which it won\u0027t, what could you do about it? Besides, you\u0027re so afraid of Erythro that your mind is probably open to all kinds of abnormal effects. What if the Plague should strike you rather than me? How would you expect me to live with that?\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s right, Eugenia,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027I\u0027ll be out there with her, and the best thing you can do is stay here and remain calm. All E-suits are equipped with radios. Marlene and I will be able to hear each other, and we will be in communication with the Dome. I promise you, if she behaves queerly in any way at all, if there is even the suspicion of oddness, I\u0027ll have her inside the Dome at once. And if I feel in any way not quite my own normal self, I will come back at once, bringing Marlene with me.\u0027\n Insigna shook her head and did not look comforted as she watched the helmet being fitted first over Marlene\u0027s head, and then over Genarr\u0027s.\n They were near the Dome\u0027s main airlock and Insigna watched its manipulation. She knew the lock procedure perfectly well - one could scarcely be a Settler otherwise.\n There was the delicate control of air pressure to make sure that there would be a gentle transfer of air from the Dome outward, never from Erythro inward. There were computerized checks at every moment to make sure there were no leaks.\n And then the inner door opened. Genarr stepped into the airlock and beckoned Marlene inward. She followed, and the door closed. The two were lost to immediate sight. Insigna distinctly felt her heart miss a beat.\n She watched the controls and knew exactly when the outer door slid open and, then, when it closed again. The holoscreen sprang to life and she could see the two suited figures on it, standing on the barren soil of Erythro.\n One of the engineers handed a small earplug to Insigna, who inserted it into her right ear. An equally small microphone was fitted over her head.\n A voice in her ear said, \u0027Radio contact,\u0027 and at once, the familiar voice of Marlene sounded. \u0027Can you hear me, Mother?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, dear,\u0027 said Insigna. Her voice sounded dry and abnormal in her own ear.\n \u0027We\u0027re out here and it\u0027s wonderful. It couldn\u0027t be nicer.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, dear,\u0027 Insigna repeated, feeling hollow and lost and wondering whether she would see her daughter in her right mind again.\n 57\n Siever Genarr felt almost lighthearted as he stepped out upon the surface of Erythro. The sloping wall of the Dome, behind him, reached upward, but he kept his back to it, for a sight so un-Erythronian would have spoiled the savor of the world.\n Savor? It was a queer word to use for Erythro, for at the moment it had no meaning. He lived behind the protection of his helmet, breathing the air of the Dome, or at least the air that had been purified and conditioned within the Dome. He could not smell the planet, or taste it, within that shelter.\n And yet there was a feel to it that made him oddly happy. His boots crunched slightly upon the ground. Although Erythro\u0027s surface was not rocky, it was rather gravelly and, between the bits of gravel, there was what he could only describe as soil. There was, of course, ample water and air to break up the primordial surface rock and, perhaps, the ubiquitous prokaryotes had, in their countless trillions, added their own work patiently over the billions of years.\n The soil felt soft. It had rained the day before, the soft and steady misty rain of Erythro - or at least of this portion of Erythro. The soil still felt slightly damp as a result, and Genarr imagined the bits of soil, the tiny scraps of sand and loam and clay, each with its coat of water film that had been refreshed and renewed. In that film, prokaryotic cells lived happily, basking in the energy of Nemesis, building complex proteins out of simple ones, while other prokaryotes, indifferent to solar energy, made use, instead of the energy content of the remnants of those prokaryotes that, in their countless trillions, died during each moment of time.\n Marlene was at his side. She was looking upward, and Genarr said gently, \u0027Don\u0027t stare at Nemesis, Marlene.\u0027\n Marlene\u0027s voice sounded naturally in his ear. It contained no tension or apprehension. Rather, her voice was filled with quiet joy. She said, \u0027I\u0027m looking at the clouds, Uncle Siever.\u0027\n Genarr looked up into the dark sky where, by squinting for a while, one could detect a faint greenish-yellow gleam. Against it were the feathery fair-weather clouds that caught Nemesis\u0027 light and reflected it in orange splendor.\n There was an eerie quiet about Erythro. There was nothing to make a sound. No form of life sang, roared, growled, bellowed, twittered, stridulated, or creaked. There were no leaves to rustle, no insects to hum. In the rare storms, there might be the rumble of thunder, or the wind might sigh against the occasional boulder - if it blew hard enough. On a peaceful, calm day, however, as this one was, it was silent.\n Genarr spoke just to make sure that it was quiet and that he had not suddenly been struck deaf. (He couldn\u0027t have been, to be sure, for he heard the faint rasp of his own breath.)\n \u0027Are you all right, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027I feel wonderful. There\u0027s a brook up there.\u0027 And she hastened her steps into an almost shambling run, hampered as she was by her E-suit.\n He said, \u0027Watch out, Marlene. You\u0027ll slip.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll be careful.\u0027 Her voice was not dimmed by increasing distance, of course, since it was a radio beam that carried it.\n Eugenia Insigna\u0027s voice sounded suddenly in Genarr\u0027s ear. \u0027Why is Marlene running, Siever?\u0027 Then, almost at once, she added, \u0027Why are you running, Marlene?\u0027\n Marlene did not bother to answer, but Genarr said, \u0027She just wants to look at some creek or other up ahead, Eugenia.\u0027\n \u0027Is she all right?\u0027\n \u0027Of course she is. It\u0027s weirdly beautiful out here. After a while, it doesn\u0027t even seem barren - more like an abstract painting.\u0027\n \u0027Never mind the art criticism, Siever. Don\u0027t let her get away from you.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m in constant contact with her. Right now, she hears what you and I are saying and if she doesn\u0027t answer, it\u0027s because she doesn\u0027t want to be bothered by irrelevancies. Eugenia, relax. Marlene is enjoying herself. Don\u0027t spoil it.\u0027\n Genarr was indeed convinced that Marlene was enjoying herself. Somehow he was, too.\n Marlene was running upstream along the brook\u0027s edge. Genarr felt no great urgency to follow her. Let her enjoy herself, he thought.\n The Dome itself was built on a rocky outcropping but the region in this direction was interlaced with small gently flowing brooks that all combined into a rather large river some thirty kilometers away that, in turn, flowed into the sea.\n The brooks were welcome, of course. They supplied the Dome with its natural water supply, once the prokaryote content was removed (actually, \u0027killed\u0027 was the better word). There had been some biologists, in the early days of the Dome, who had objected to the killing of the prokaryotes, but that was ridiculous. The tiny specks of life were so incredibly numerous on the planet, and could proliferate so rapidly to replace any shrinkage of their numbers, that no amount of ordinary killing in the process of ensuring a water supply could hurt them, in any significant way. Then, once the Plague began, a vague but strong hostility to Erythro rose up, and, after that, no-one cared what one did to the prokaryotes.\n Of course, now that the Plague did not seem to be much of a threat any longer, humanitarian feelings (Genarr privately felt that \u0027biotarian\u0027 was the better word) might rise again. Genarr sympathized with those feelings, but then what would the Dome do for a water supply?\n Lost in thought, he was no longer looking at Marlene, and the shriek sounded deafeningly in his ear. \u0027Marlene! Marlene! Siever, what is she doing?\u0027\n Now he looked up, and was about to answer with automatic reassurance that nothing was wrong, that all was well, when he caught sight of Marlene.\n For a moment, he could not tell what she was doing. He just stared at her in the pink light of Nemesis.\n Then he made it out. She was unhitching her helmet and was taking it off. Now she was working at removing the rest of her E-suit. He had to stop this!\n Genarr tried to call out to her, but in the horror of the emergency, he couldn\u0027t find his voice. He tried to run to her, but his legs felt leaden, and barely responded to the urgency of his feelings.\n It was as though he found himself in a nightmare where dreadful things were happening, and he could do nothing to prevent them. Or, perhaps, his mind, under the stress of events, was dissociating from his body.\n Is this the Plague, striking at me? Genarr wondered in panic. And, if so, what will happen to Marlene now, as she is baring herself to the light of Nemesis and the air of Erythro? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-26.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies. One of the colonies, Rotor, has broken away from the solar system to create its own renegade utopia around an unknown red star two light-years from Earth: a star named Nemesis. Now a fifteen-year-old Rotorian girl has learned of the dire threat that nemesis poses to Earth\u0027s people--but she is prevented from warning them. Soon she will realize that Nemesis endangers Rotor as well. And so it will be up to her alone to save both Earth and Rotor as--drawn inexorably by Nemesis, the death star--they hurtle toward certain disaster.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nemesis.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:29 AM"}}
