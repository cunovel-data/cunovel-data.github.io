He had not thought that Rotor had become so much a part of him in a matter of not quite four years. It had been the longest period during which he had been away from Earth, but surely it had not been long enough to make Earth seem strange to him. There was now the sheer size of Earth, the distant horizon ending sharp against the sky instead of turning up mistily. There were the crowds, the unchanging gravity, the sense of wild and willful atmosphere, of temperature soaring and diving, of nature out of all control. It was not that he had to experience any of this to feel it. Even when he was in his own quarters, he knew it was all out there and the ferality of it all pervaded his spirit, somehow invaded it. Or it might be that the room was too small, too full, that the drift of sound was too unmistakable, as though he were being pressed in on by a crowded and decaying world. Strange that he had missed Earth so intensely in those years on Rotor; and that, now that he was back on Earth, he missed Rotor so intensely. Was he to spend his life wanting to be where he was not? The signal light flashed and he heard the buzz. It flickered - things on Earth tended to flicker, while on Rotor everything was constant with an almost aggressive efficiency. \u0027Enter,\u0027 he said in a low voice, but it was loud enough to activate the de-locking mechanism. Garand Wyler entered (Fisher knew it would be he) and looked at the other with an amused expression. \u0027Have you budged since I left, Crile?\u0027 \u0027Here and there. I\u0027ve eaten. Spent some time in the bathroom.\u0027 \u0027Good. You\u0027re alive, then, even if you don\u0027t look it.\u0027 He was grinning broadly, his skin smooth and brown, his eyes dark, his teeth white, his hair thick and crisp. \u0027Brooding about Rotor?\u0027 \u0027I think of it now and then.\u0027 \u0027I kept meaning to ask, but never got around to it. It was Snow White without the Seven Dwarfs, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Snow White,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027I never saw one black person there.\u0027 \u0027In that case, good riddance to them. Did you know that they\u0027re gone?\u0027 Fisher\u0027s muscles tightened and he nearly got to his feet, but he resisted the impulse. He said, nodding, \u0027They said they would be.\u0027 \u0027They meant it. They drifted away. We watched as far as we could; eavesdropped their radiation. They pumped up speed with this hyper-assistance of theirs and, in a split second, while we could still make them out loud and clear, they were gone. Everything cut off.\u0027 \u0027Did you pick them up when they got back into space?\u0027 \u0027Several times. Each time weaker. They were traveling at the speed of light after they had really flexed their muscles, and after three blips, into hyperspace and back into space, they were too far to be picked up.\u0027 Fisher said bitterly, \u0027Their choice. They kicked out the nays - like me.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry you weren\u0027t there. You should have been. It was interesting to watch. You know there were some hard-liners who insisted to the very end that hyper-assistance was a fraud, that it was all faked up, for some reason.\u0027 \u0027Rotor had the Far Probe. They couldn\u0027t have it sent as far away as they did without hyper-assistance.\u0027 \u0027Faked! That\u0027s what the hard-liners said.\u0027 \u0027It was genuine.\u0027 \u0027Yes, now they know it was. All of them. When Rotor just vanished off the instruments, there was no other explanation. Every Settlement was watching. No mistake. It vanished on every set of instruments at the same second. The irritating thing is, we can\u0027t tell where it\u0027s going.\u0027 \u0027Alpha Centauri, I suppose. Where else?\u0027 \u0027The Office keeps thinking that it might not be Alpha Centauri and that you might know that.\u0027 Fisher looked annoyed. \u0027I\u0027ve been debriefed all the way to the Moon and back. I haven\u0027t held back anything.\u0027 \u0027Sure. We know that. It\u0027s nothing you know about. They want me to talk to you, friend to friend, and see what you may know that you don\u0027t know about. Something may turn up that you haven\u0027t thought of. You were there four years, married, had a kid. You couldn\u0027t have missed everything.\u0027 \u0027How could I? If there were the slightest notion that I was after anything, I\u0027d have been kicked off. Just being from Earth made me completely suspect. If I hadn\u0027t married - given that kind of proof that I planned to stay Rotorian - I would have been kicked off anyway. And as it was, they kept me far away from anything critical or sensitive.\u0027 Fisher looked away. \u0027And it worked. My wife was just an astronomer. I didn\u0027t have my pick, you know. I couldn\u0027t put an ad on holovision announcing that I was in the market for a young lady who was a hyperspatialist. If I had met one, I would have done my best to hook on to her even if she looked like a hyena, but I never met one in all my time there. The technology was so sensitive, I think they kept the key people in complete isolation. I think they must all have worn masks in the laboratories and used code names. Four years - and I never got a hint, never found out a thing. And I knew it would mean I was through with the Office.\u0027 He turned to Garand and said with sudden passion, \u0027Things got so bad that I turned into some kind of lout. The sense of failure was just overpowering.\u0027 Wyler was sitting across the table from Fisher in the cluttered room, teetering back on the rear legs of his chair, but carefully holding the table lest he teeter too far. He said, \u0027Crile, the Office can\u0027t afford to be delicate, but it isn\u0027t totally unfeeling. They regret having to approach you like this, but they must. And I regret being given the job, but I must. We are concerned that you\u0027ve failed and brought us nothing. If Rotor hadn\u0027t left, we might have felt there was nothing to bring. But they did leave. They did have hyper-assistance, and yet you\u0027ve brought us nothing.\u0027 \u0027I know that.\u0027 \u0027But that doesn\u0027t mean we want to throw you out or - get rid of you. We hope we can still use you. So I have to make sure that your failure was an honest one.\u0027 \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 \u0027I have to be able to tell them that you didn\u0027t fail because of any personal weakness. After all, you married a Rotorian woman. Was she pretty? Were you fond of her?\u0027 Fisher snarled, \u0027What you\u0027re really asking is whether, out of love for a Rotorian woman, I deliberately protected Rotor and helped them keep their secret.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Wyler, unmoved. \u0027Did you?\u0027 \u0027How can you ask that? If I had decided to be a Rotorian, I would have left with them. By now I would be lost in space and you might never find me. But I didn\u0027t do that. I got off Rotor and returned to Earth, even though I knew my failure would probably destroy my career.\u0027 \u0027We appreciate your loyalty.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s more loyalty in this than you think.\u0027 \u0027We recognize that you probably loved your wife and that, as a matter of duty, you had to leave her. That would count in your favor, if we could be sure-\u0027 \u0027Not so much my wife. It was my daughter.\u0027 Wyler viewed Fisher thoughtfully. \u0027We know you have a one-year-old daughter, Crile. Under the circumstances, perhaps you shouldn\u0027t have given that particular hostage to fortune.\u0027 \u0027I agree. But I can treat myself as though I were a well-oiled robot. Things happen against one\u0027s will sometimes. And once the child was born and I had had her for a year-\u0027 \u0027That is understandable, but it was only a year. Scarcely time, really, to build a relationship-\u0027 Fisher grimaced. \u0027You may think it understandable, but you don\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027Explain, then. I\u0027ll try.\u0027 \u0027It was my sister, you see. My younger sister.\u0027 Wyler nodded. \u0027There\u0027s mention of that in your compufile. Rose, I think.\u0027 \u0027Roseanne. She died in the San Francisco riots eight years ago. She was only seventeen.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027She wasn\u0027t a participant on either side. She was one of those innocent bystanders who is so more apt to get hurt than the ringleaders or the officers. At least we found her body and I had something to cremate.\u0027 Wyler maintained a half-embarrassed silence. Fisher said finally, \u0027She was only seventeen. Our parents died\u0027 - he brushed his hand to one side, as though indicating it was not something he wished to discuss - \u0027when she was four and I was fourteen. I worked after school and I saw to it that she was fed, and clothed, and comfortable, even when I was not. I taught myself programming - not that I ever made a decent living out of that either - and then, when she was seventeen, when she had never hurt a soul, when she didn\u0027t even know what all the fighting and shouting was about, she was simply trapped-\u0027 Wyler said, \u0027I can see why you volunteered for Rotor.\u0027 \u0027Oh yes. For a couple of years I was just numb. I joined the Office partly to keep my mind occupied and partly because I thought there would be danger in it. I rather looked forward to death for a while - if I could manage to do something useful en route. When the problem of placing an agent on Rotor was discussed, I volunteered for it. I wanted to get off Earth.\u0027 \u0027And now you\u0027re back. Do you regret that?\u0027 \u0027A little bit, yes, but Rotor choked me. With all its faults, Earth has room. If only you could have seen Roseanne, Garand. You have no idea. She wasn\u0027t pretty, but she had such eyes.\u0027 Fisher\u0027s own eyes were focused on the past, a slight pucker between his brows as though he were peering hard to clearly focus. \u0027Beautiful eyes, but frightening ones. It seemed to me that I could never meet them without feeling nervous. She could look right into you - if you know what I mean.\u0027 \u0027Actually, I don\u0027t,\u0027 said Wyler. Fisher paid no attention. \u0027She always knew when you were lying or hiding the truth. You couldn\u0027t be silent without her guessing what the trouble was.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not going to tell me she was a telepath.\u0027 \u0027What? Oh no. She used to say she read expressions and listened to intonations. She said no-one could hide what they were thinking. No matter how you laughed, you could not hide the tragic undercurrent; no smile sufficed to hide bitterness. She tried to explain, but I could never grasp what it was she did. She was something special, Garand. I was in awe of her. And then my child was born. Marlene.\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027She had the same eyes.\u0027 \u0027The baby had your sister\u0027s eyes?\u0027 \u0027Not immediately, but I watched them develop. When she was six months old, those eyes made me flinch.\u0027 \u0027Your wife flinched, too?\u0027 \u0027I never noticed her being affected, but then, she never had a sister Roseanne. Marlene hardly cried at all; she was peaceful. I remember Roseanne was like that as a baby. And Marlene didn\u0027t show any signs that she was going to be particularly pretty either. It was as though Roseanne had come back to me. So you see how hard it turned out to be.\u0027 \u0027Coming back to Earth, you mean.\u0027 \u0027Doing that and leaving them behind. It was like losing Roseanne a second time. I\u0027ll never see her now. Never!\u0027 \u0027But you came back anyway.\u0027 \u0027Loyalty! Duty! But if you want the truth, I almost didn\u0027t. I was standing there, torn. Torn apart, I was desperately wanting not to leave Roseanne - Marlene. You see, I confuse the names. And Eugenia - my wife - said to me in a heartbroken way, \"If you knew where we were going, you wouldn\u0027t be so ready to turn back.\" And at that moment I didn\u0027t want to leave. I asked her to come to Earth with me. She refused. I asked her to let me take Ro - Marlene, at least. She refused. And then, when I might have given in and stayed, she went wild and ordered me out. And I went.\u0027 Wyler stared at Fisher reflectively. \u0027 \"If you knew where we were going, you wouldn\u0027t be so ready to turn back.\" Is that what she said?\u0027 \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what she said. And when I said, \"Why? Where is Rotor going?\", she said, \"To the stars.\" \u0027 \u0027That can\u0027t be right, Crile. You knew they were planning to go to the stars, but she said, \"If you knew where we were going-\" There was something you didn\u0027t know. What was it you didn\u0027t know?\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about? How can anyone know what he doesn\u0027t know?\u0027 Wyler shrugged it off. \u0027Did you tell this to the Office during the debriefing?\u0027 Fisher considered. \u0027I guess not. I didn\u0027t even think of it till I started telling you the story about how I nearly stayed.\u0027 He closed his eyes, then said slowly, \u0027No, this is the first time I\u0027ve talked about that. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve let myself think about it.\u0027 \u0027Very well, then. Now that you think about it - where was Rotor going? Did you hear any speculations on Rotor about that? Any rumors? Any guesses?\u0027 \u0027The assumption was that it would be to Alpha Centauri. Where else? It\u0027s the nearest star.\u0027 \u0027Your wife was an astronomer. What did she say about it?\u0027 \u0027Nothing. She never discussed it.\u0027 \u0027Rotor sent out the Far Probe.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027And your wife was involved - as an astronomer.\u0027 \u0027She was, but she never discussed it either, and I was careful not to do so. My mission would have been aborted, and perhaps I might have been imprisoned - or executed, for all I know - if I displayed an unhealthy curiosity too openly.\u0027 \u0027But as an astronomer, she would know the destination. She as much as said so. \"If you knew-\" You see? She knew and if you knew, too-\u0027 Fisher didn\u0027t seem interested. \u0027Since she didn\u0027t tell me what she knew, I can\u0027t tell you.\u0027 \u0027Are you sure? No casual remarks whose significance you didn\u0027t note at the time? After all, you\u0027re not an astronomer and she might have said something you didn\u0027t quite get. Do you remember anything at all she said that set you to puzzling?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t think of anything.\u0027 \u0027Think! Is it possible that the Far Probe located a planetary system around one or both of the Sun-like stars of Alpha Centauri?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t say.\u0027 \u0027Or planets about any star?\u0027 Fisher shrugged. \u0027Think!\u0027 said Wyler urgently. \u0027Is there any reason for you to think that she meant, \"You think we\u0027re going to Alpha Centauri, but there are planets circling it and we\u0027re heading for those.\" Or could she have meant, \"You think we\u0027re going to Alpha Centauri, but we\u0027re going to another star where we\u0027re sure there will be a useful planet.\" Something like that?\u0027 \u0027I couldn\u0027t possibly guess.\u0027 Garand Wyler\u0027s generous lips compressed themselves tightly for a moment. Then he said, \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what, Crile, my old friend. There are three things that are going to happen now. First, you\u0027re going to have to undergo another debriefing. Second, I suspect we\u0027re going to have to persuade the Ceres Settlement to allow us the use of their asteroid telescope, and use it to inspect, very closely, every star within a hundred light-years of the Solar System. And, third, we\u0027ll have to whip our hyperspatialists into jumping a little higher and farther. You watch and see if that\u0027s not what happens.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-9.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
