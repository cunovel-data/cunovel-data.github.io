She had grown used to invading his office at will.\n \u0027Am I interrupting you at a busy time, Uncle Siever?\u0027\n \u0027No, dear, this is not really a busy job. It was devised so that Pitt could get rid of me, and I took it and kept it so that I could be rid of Pitt. It\u0027s not something I would admit to everyone, but I\u0027m compelled to tell you the truth since you always spot the lie.\u0027\n \u0027Does that frighten you, Uncle Siever? It frightened Commissioner Pitt, and it would have frightened Aurinel - if I had ever let him see what I could do.\u0027\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t frighten me, Marlene, because I\u0027ve given up, you see. I\u0027ve just made up my mind that I\u0027m made of glass as far as you\u0027re concerned. Actually, it\u0027s restful. Lying is hard work when you stop to think about it. If people were really lazy, they\u0027d never lie.\u0027\n Marlene smiled again. \u0027Is that why you like me? Because I make it possible for you to be lazy?\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t you tell?\u0027\n \u0027No. I can tell you like me, but I can\u0027t tell why you like me. The way you hold yourself shows you like me, but the reason is hidden inside your mind and all I can get about that are vague feelings sometimes. I can\u0027t quite reach in there.\u0027 She thought for a while. \u0027Sometimes I wish I could.\u0027\n \u0027Be glad you can\u0027t. Minds are dirty, dank, uncomfortable places.\u0027\n \u0027Why do you say that, Uncle Siever?\u0027\n \u0027Experience. I don\u0027t have your natural ability, but I\u0027ve been around people for much longer than you have. Do you like the inside of your own mind, Marlene?\u0027\n Marlene looked surprised. \u0027I don\u0027t know. Why shouldn\u0027t I?\u0027\n \u0027Do you like everything you think? Everything you imagine? Every impulse you have? Be honest, now. Even though I can\u0027t read you, be honest.\u0027\n \u0027Well, sometimes I think silly things, or mean things. Sometimes I get angry and think of doing things I wouldn\u0027t really do. But not often, really.\u0027\n \u0027Not often? Don\u0027t forget that you\u0027re used to your own mind. You hardly sense it. It\u0027s like the clothes you wear. You don\u0027t feel the touch of them because you\u0027re so used to their being there. Your hair curls down the back of your neck, but you don\u0027t notice. If someone else\u0027s hair touched the back of your neck, it would itch and be unbearable. Someone else\u0027s mind might think thoughts no worse than yours, but they would be someone else\u0027s thoughts and you wouldn\u0027t like them. For instance, you might not like my liking you - if you knew why I liked you. It is much better and more peaceful to accept my liking you as something that exists, and not scour my mind for reasons.\u0027\n And inevitably, Marlene said, \u0027Why? What are the reasons?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I like you because once I was you.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean I was a young lady with beautiful eyes and the gift of perception. I mean that I was young and thought I was plain and that everyone disliked me for being plain. And I knew I was intelligent, and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone didn\u0027t like me for being intelligent. It seemed unfair to be scorned for a bad property while a good property was ignored.\u0027\n \u0027I was hurt and angry, Marlene, and made up my mind that I would never treat others as people treated me, but I haven\u0027t had much chance to put that good resolution into practice. Then I met you, and you come close. You\u0027re not as plain as I was by far, and you\u0027re much more intelligent than I ever was, but I don\u0027t mind your being better than me.\u0027 He smiled very broadly. \u0027It\u0027s like giving myself a second chance - with advantages. But come, I don\u0027t think that is what you came to talk to me about. I may not be perceptive in your sense, but I can tell that much.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s my mother.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Genarr frowned with a sudden obvious and almost painful increase in interest. \u0027What about her?\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s just about finished her project here, you know. If she goes back to Rotor, she\u0027ll want me to go back with her. Must I?\u0027\n \u0027I think so. Don\u0027t you want to?\u0027\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t, Uncle Siever. I feel it\u0027s important that I stay here. So what I would like you to do is to tell Commissioner Pitt that you would like to keep us here. You can make up an excuse that sounds good. And the Commissioner, I\u0027m pretty sure, will be quite glad to have us stay, especially if you explain that Mother has found out that Nemesis will destroy Earth.\u0027\n \u0027Has she told you that, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027No, she didn\u0027t, but she didn\u0027t have to. You can explain to the Commissioner that Mother will probably annoy him continually with her insistence that the Solar System be warned.\u0027\n \u0027Has it occurred to you that Pitt would not be keen on obliging me? If he gets the idea I want to keep Eugenia and you here in the Erythro Dome, he\u0027s liable to order you back to Rotor just to annoy me.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m quite sure,\u0027 said Marlene calmly, \u0027that the Commissioner would much rather please himself by keeping us here, than displease you by taking us back. Besides, you want Mother here because you\u0027re - you\u0027re fond of her.\u0027\n \u0027Very fond of her. All my life, it seems. But your mother\u0027s not fond of me. You told me quite a while ago that your father still occupies her thoughts.\u0027\n \u0027She likes you more and more, Uncle Siever. She likes you a great deal.\u0027\n \u0027Liking is not loving, Marlene. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve already discovered that.\u0027\n Marlene reddened. \u0027I\u0027m talking about old people.\u0027\n \u0027Like me,\u0027 and Genarr leaned his head back and laughed. Then he said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Marlene. It\u0027s just that old people always think young people haven\u0027t really learned about love; and young people think that old people have forgotten about love; and, you know, they\u0027re both wrong. And why do you think it\u0027s important to stay in the Erythro Dome, Marlene? Surely not just because you like me.\u0027\n \u0027Of course I like you,\u0027 said Marlene seriously. \u0027Very much. But I want to stay here because I like Erythro.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve explained that it\u0027s a dangerous world.\u0027\n \u0027Not for me.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re still certain that the Plague won\u0027t affect you?\u0027\n \u0027Of course it won\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027But how do you know?\u0027\n \u0027I just know. I\u0027ve always known this, even when I was on Rotor. I had no reason not to.\u0027\n \u0027No, you didn\u0027t. But after you were told about the Plague?\u0027\n \u0027That didn\u0027t change things. I feel completely safe here. Even more than on Rotor.\u0027\n Genarr shook his head slowly. \u0027I must admit that I don\u0027t understand this.\u0027 He studied her solemn face, her dark eyes half-hidden by those magnificent lashes, \u0027However, let me read your body language, Marlene - if I can. You mean to have your own way in this, at whatever cost, and to remain on Erythro.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Marlene flatly. \u0027And I expect you to help me.\u0027\n 41\n Eugenia Insigna blazed quietly with anger. Her voice was not loud, but it was intense. \u0027He can\u0027t do this, Siever.\u0027\n \u0027Of course he can, Eugenia,\u0027 said Genarr just as quietly. \u0027He\u0027s the Commissioner.\u0027\n \u0027But he\u0027s not an absolute ruler. I have my citizen\u0027s rights, and one of them is freedom of movement.\u0027\n \u0027If the Commissioner wishes to establish a state of emergency, either general, or, for that matter, confined to one person, then citizen\u0027s rights are suspended. That\u0027s more or less the gist of what the Enabling Act of \u002724 says.\u0027\n \u0027But it makes a mockery of all the laws and traditions we have, dating back to Rotor\u0027s establishment.\u0027\n \u0027I agree.\u0027\n \u0027And if I make an outcry over this, Pitt will find himself-\u0027\n \u0027Eugenia, please. Listen to me. Let it go. For now, why don\u0027t you and Marlene simply stay here? You\u0027re more than welcome.\u0027\n \u0027What are you saying? This amounts to imprisonment without accusation, without trial, without judgement. We are compelled to stay in Erythro indefinitely by the arbitrary ukase-\u0027\n \u0027Please do it without objection. It will be better.\u0027\n \u0027How better?\u0027 Insigna spoke with infinite contempt.\n \u0027Because Marlene, your daughter, is very anxious that you do so.\u0027\n Insigna looked blank. \u0027Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027Last week she came to me full of suggestions that I maneuver the Commissioner into ordering the two of you to remain here on Erythro.\u0027\n Insigna half-rose from her seat, wildly indignant. \u0027And you actually did it?\u0027\n Genarr shook his head vigorously. \u0027No. Now listen to me. All I did was to inform Pitt that your work here was finished and that I was uncertain whether it was his intention to have you return to Rotor with Marlene or to stay here. It was a perfectly neutral statement, Eugenia. I showed it to Marlene before I sent it off and she was satisfied. She said, and I quote, \"If you give him the choice, he will keep us here.\" And, apparently, he\u0027s doing that.\u0027\n Insigna sank back. \u0027Siever, are you really following the advice of a fifteen-year-old girl?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think of Marlene as merely a fifteen-year-old girl. But tell me, why are you so anxious to go back to Rotor?\u0027\n \u0027My work-\u0027\n \u0027There is none. There will be none if Pitt doesn\u0027t want you. Even assuming he allows you to return, you\u0027d find yourself replaced. Here, on the other hand, you\u0027ll find equipment you can use - that you have used. You came here, after all, to do what could not be done on Rotor.\u0027\n \u0027My work doesn\u0027t matter!\u0027 cried out Insigna with sweeping inconsistency. \u0027Don\u0027t you see that I want to return for the same reason that he wants me to stay? He wants Marlene destroyed. If I had known, before I left, of this Erythro Plague, we\u0027d never have come. I can\u0027t risk Marlene\u0027s mind.\u0027\n \u0027Her mind is the last thing I\u0027d want to risk,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027I would sooner risk myself.\u0027\n \u0027But it is at risk if we stay here.\u0027\n \u0027Marlene doesn\u0027t think so.\u0027\n \u0027Marlene! Marlene! You seem to think she\u0027s a goddess. What does she know?\u0027\n \u0027Listen to me, Eugenia. Let\u0027s talk about this rationally. If it really seemed that Marlene was in danger, I would get you both back to Rotor somehow, but listen to me first. There\u0027s nothing megalomaniacal about Marlene, is there?\u0027\n Insigna was trembling. Her passion had not receded. \u0027I don\u0027t know what you mean.\u0027\n \u0027Is she prone to making grandiose claims that are fanciful, that are patently ridiculous?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not. She\u0027s a very sensible- Why do you ask these questions? You know that she makes no claims that aren\u0027t-\u0027\n \u0027That aren\u0027t substantiated. I know. She never boasted about her perceptivity. It was more or less forced out of her by circumstance.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but what is the purpose of all this?\u0027\n Genarr kept on, quietly. \u0027Has she ever laid claim to having strange intuitive powers? Has she ever expressed herself as certain that something, some particular something, was sure to happen, or was sure not to happen, for no reason other than that she was certain?\u0027\n \u0027No, of course not. She clings to evidence. She doesn\u0027t make wild claims without evidence.\u0027\n \u0027Yet in one respect, perhaps only in one respect, she does. She is certain that the Plague cannot touch her. She claims that she experienced this utter confidence, this certainty that Erythro cannot harm her, even on Rotor, and that it grew stronger when she reached the Dome. She is quite determined - completely determined - to remain here.\u0027\n Insigna\u0027s eyes widened and her hand flew to her mouth. She made an inarticulate sound and then said, \u0027In that case-\u0027 and remained staring at him.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Genarr said in sudden alarm.\n \u0027Don\u0027t you see it? Isn\u0027t this the Plague striking? Her personality is changing. Her mind is being affected.\u0027\n Genarr sat frozen at the thought for a moment, then he said, \u0027No, it can\u0027t be. In all the cases of Plague, nothing like this has been detected. This is not the Plague.\u0027\n \u0027Her mind is different from those of others. It would be affected differently.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Genarr desperately. \u0027I can\u0027t believe that. I won\u0027t believe that. I believe that if Marlene says she is certain she is immune, that she is immune, and that her immunity will help us solve the puzzle of the Plague.\u0027\n Insigna\u0027s face whitened. \u0027Is that why you want her here on Erythro, Siever? To use her as a tool against the Plague?\u0027\n \u0027No. I don\u0027t want her here only to use her. Nevertheless, she wants to stay and she may be a tool, quite apart from whether we want her to be one or not.\u0027\n \u0027And just because she wants to remain on Erythro, you are willing to allow her to do so? Just because she wants to stay out of some perverse desire she can\u0027t explain and in which you and I can see no reason or logic. You seriously think she should be allowed to remain here merely because she wishes to? Do you dare tell me that?\u0027\n Genarr said with an effort, \u0027As a matter of fact, I am tempted in that direction.\u0027\n \u0027It is easy for you to be tempted. She is not your child. She is my child. She is the only-\u0027\n \u0027I know,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027She is the only thing you have left of - Crile. Don\u0027t stare at me like that. I know that you have never overcome your loss. I understand how you feel.\u0027 He said this last softly, gently, and looked as if he wanted to reach out and touch Insigna\u0027s bowed head.\n \u0027Just the same, Eugenia, if Marlene really wants to explore Erythro, I think nothing will stop her from doing so in the end. And if she is absolutely convinced that the Plague will not touch her mind, perhaps that mental attitude will prevent it from doing so. Marlene\u0027s aggressive sanity and confidence may be her mental immune mechanism.\u0027\n Insigna snapped her head up, her eyes smoldering. \u0027You are speaking nonsense, and you have no right to give in to this sudden streak of romanticism in a mere child. She is a stranger to you. You do not love her.\u0027\n \u0027She is no stranger to me and I do love her. More important, I admire her. Love would not give me that depth of confidence that would permit the risk, but admiration would. Think about it.\u0027\n And they sat there, staring at each other. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-20.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
