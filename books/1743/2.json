{"id":70483,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"1\n Marlene had last seen the Solar System when she was a little over one year old. She didn\u0027t remember it, of course.\n She had read a great deal about it, but none of the reading had ever made her feel that it could ever have been part of her, nor she a part of it.\n In all her fifteen years of life, she remembered only Rotor. She had always thought of it as a large world. It was eight kilometers across, after all. Every once in a while since she was ten - once a month when she could manage it - she had walked around it for the exercise, and sometimes had taken the low-gravity paths so she could skim a little. That was always fun. Skim or walk, Rotor went on and on, with its buildings, its parks, its farms, and mostly its people.\n It took her a whole day to do it, but her mother didn\u0027t mind. She said Rotor was perfectly safe. \u0027Not like Earth,\u0027 she would say, but she wouldn\u0027t say why Earth was not safe. \u0027Never mind,\u0027 she would say.\n It was the people Marlene liked least. The new census, they said, would show sixty thousand of them on Rotor. Too many. Far too many. Every one of them showing a false face. Marlene hated seeing those false faces and knowing there was something different inside. Nor could she say anything about it. She had tried sometimes when she had been younger, but her mother had grown angry and told her she must never say things like that.\n As she got older, she could see the falseness more clearly, but it bothered her less. She had learned to take it for granted and spend as much time as possible with herself and her own thoughts.\n Lately, her thoughts were often on Erythro, the planet they had been orbiting almost all her life. She didn\u0027t know why these thoughts were coming to her, but she would skim to the observation deck at odd hours and just stare at the planet hungrily, wanting to be there - right there on Erythro.\n Her mother would ask her, impatiently, why she should want to be on an empty barren planet, but she never had an answer for that. She didn\u0027t know. \u0027I just want to,\u0027 she would say.\n She was watching it now, alone on the observation deck. Rotorians hardly ever came here. They had seen it all, Marlene guessed, and for some reason they didn\u0027t have her interest in Erythro.\n There it was; partly in light, partly dark. She had a dim memory of being held to watch it swim into view, seeing it every once in a while, always larger, as Rotor slowly approached all those years ago.\n Was it a real memory? After all, she had been getting on toward four then, so it might be.\n But now that memory - real or not - was overlaid by other thoughts, by an increasing realization of just how large a planet was. Erythro was over twelve thousand kilometers across, not eight kilometers. She couldn\u0027t grasp that size. It didn\u0027t look that large on the screen and she couldn\u0027t imagine standing on it and seeing for hundreds - or even thousands - of kilometers. But she knew she wanted to. Very much.\n Aurinel wasn\u0027t interested in Erythro, which was disappointing. He said he had other things to think of, like getting ready for college. He was seventeen and a half. Marlene was only just past fifteen. That didn\u0027t make much difference, she thought rebelliously, since girls developed more quickly.\n At least they should. She looked down at herself and thought, with her usual dismay and disappointment, that somehow she still looked like a kid, short and stubby.\n She looked at Erythro again, large and beautiful and softly red where it was lit. It was large enough to be a planet but actually, she knew, it was a satellite. It circled Megas, and it was Megas (much larger still) that was really the planet, even though everyone called Erythro by that name. The two of them together, Megas and Erythro, and Rotor, too, circled the star Nemesis.\n \u0027Marlene!\u0027\n Marlene heard the voice behind her and knew that it was Aurinel. She had grown increasingly tongue-tied with him of late, and the reason for it embarrassed her. She loved the way he pronounced her name. He pronounced it correctly. Three syllables - Mar-LAY-nuh - with a little trill to the \u0027r\u0027. It warmed her just to hear it.\n She turned and mumbled, \u0027Hi, Aurinel,\u0027 and tried not to turn red.\n He grinned at her. \u0027You\u0027re staring at Erythro, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n She didn\u0027t answer that. Of course that\u0027s what she would be doing. Everyone knew how she felt about Erythro. \u0027How come you\u0027re here?\u0027 (Tell me you were looking for me, she thought.)\n Aurinel said, \u0027Your mother sent me.\u0027\n (Oh well.) \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027She said you were in a bad mood and every time you felt sorry for yourself, you came up here, and I was to come and get you because she said it would just make you grumpier to stay here. So why are you in a bad mood?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not. And if I am, I have reasons.\u0027\n \u0027What reasons? Come on, now. You\u0027re not a little kid any more. You\u0027ve got to be able to express yourself.\u0027\n Marlene lifted her eyebrows. \u0027I am quite articulate, thank you. My reasons are that I would like to travel.\u0027\n Aurinel laughed. \u0027You\u0027ve traveled, Marlene. You\u0027ve traveled more than two light-years. No-one in the whole history of the Solar System has ever traveled even a small fraction of a light-year - except us. So you have no right to complain. You\u0027re Marlene Insigna Fisher, Galactic Traveler.\u0027\n Marlene suppressed a giggle. Insigna was her mother\u0027s maiden name and whenever Aurinel said her three names in full, he would salute and make a face, and he hadn\u0027t done that in a long time. She guessed it was because he was getting close to being a grown-up and he had to practice being dignified.\n She said, \u0027I can\u0027t remember that trip at all. You know I can\u0027t, and not being able to remember it means it doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027re just here, over two light-years from the Solar System, and we\u0027re never going back.\u0027\n \u0027How do you know?\u0027\n \u0027Come on, Aurinel. Do you ever hear anyone talk about going back?\u0027\n \u0027Well, even if we don\u0027t, who cares? Earth is a crowded world and the whole Solar System was getting crowded and used up. We\u0027re better off out here - masters of all we survey.\u0027\n \u0027No, we\u0027re not. We survey Erythro, but we don\u0027t go down there to be its masters.\u0027\n \u0027Sure we do. We have a fine working Dome on Erythro. You know that.\u0027\n \u0027Not for us. Just for some scientists. I\u0027m talking about us. They don\u0027t let us go down there.\u0027\n \u0027In time,\u0027 said Aurinel cheerfully.\n \u0027Sure, when I\u0027m an old woman. Or dead.\u0027\n \u0027Things aren\u0027t that bad. Anyway, come on out of here and into the world and make your mother happy. I can\u0027t stay here. I have things to do. Dolorette-\u0027\n Marlene felt a buzzing in her ears and she didn\u0027t hear exactly what Aurinel said after that. It was enough to hear - Dolorette!\n Marlene hated Dolorette, who was tall and - vacuous.\n But what was the use? Aurinel had been hanging around her, and Marlene knew, just by looking at him, exactly how he felt about Dolorette. And now he had been sent to find her and he was just wasting his time. She could tell that was how he felt and she could also tell how anxious he was to get back to that - to that Dolorette. (Why could she always tell? It was so hateful sometimes.)\n Quite suddenly, Marlene wanted to hurt him, to find words to give him pain. True words, though. She wouldn\u0027t lie to him. She said, \u0027We\u0027re never going back to the Solar System. I know why not.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, why\u0027s that?\u0027 When Marlene, hesitating, said nothing, he added, \u0027Mysteries?\u0027\n Marlene was caught. She was not supposed to say this. She mumbled, \u0027I don\u0027t want to say. I\u0027m not supposed to know.\u0027 But she did want to say. At the moment she wanted everyone to feel bad.\n \u0027But you\u0027ll tell me. We\u0027re friends, aren\u0027t we?\u0027\n \u0027Are we?\u0027 Marlene asked. She said, \u0027OK, I\u0027ll tell you. We\u0027re not ever going back because Earth is going to be destroyed.\u0027\n Aurinel didn\u0027t react as she had expected. He burst into a loud squawk of a laugh. It took him a while to settle down, and she glared at him indignantly.\n \u0027Marlene,\u0027 he said, \u0027where did you hear that? You\u0027ve been viewing thrillers.\u0027\n \u0027I have not!\u0027\n \u0027But what makes you say anything like that?\u0027\n \u0027Because I know. I can tell. From what people say, but don\u0027t say, and what they do, when they don\u0027t know they\u0027re doing it. And from things the computer tells me when I ask the right questions.\u0027\n \u0027Like what things it tells you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not going to tell you.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it possible? Just barely possible\u0027 - and he held up two fingers very closely together - \u0027that you\u0027re imagining things?\u0027\n \u0027No, it isn\u0027t possible. Earth won\u0027t be destroyed right away - maybe not for thousands of years - but it\u0027s going to be destroyed.\u0027 She nodded solemnly, her face intense. \u0027And nothing can stop it.\u0027\n Marlene turned and walked away, angry at Aurinel for doubting her. No, not doubting her. It was more than that. He thought she was out of her mind. And there it was. She had said too much and had gained nothing by it. Everything was wrong.\n Aurinel was staring after her. The laughter had ceased on his boyishly handsome face and a certain uneasiness was creasing the skin between his eyebrows.\n 2\n Eugenia Insigna had grown middle-aged during the trip to Nemesis, and in the course of the long stay after arrival. Over the years she had periodically warned herself: This is for life; and for our children\u0027s lives into the unseen future.\n The thought always weighed her down.\n Why? She had known this as the inevitable consequence of what they had done from the moment Rotor had left the Solar System. Everyone on Rotor - volunteers all - had known it. Those who had not had the heart for eternal separation had left Rotor before takeoff, and among those who had left was-\n Eugenia did not finish that thought. It often came, and she tried never to finish it.\n Now they were here on Rotor, but was Rotor \u0027home\u0027? It was home for Marlene; she had never known anything else. But for herself, for Eugenia? Home was Earth and Moon and Sun and Mars and all the worlds that had accompanied humanity through its history and prehistory. They had accompanied life as long as there had been life. The thought that \u0027home\u0027 was not here on Rotor clung to her even now.\n But, then, she had spent the first twenty-eight years of her life in the Solar System and she had done graduate work on Earth itself in her twenty-first to twenty-third years.\n Odd how the thought of Earth periodically came to her and lingered. She hadn\u0027t liked Earth. She hadn\u0027t liked its crowds, its poor organization, its combination of anarchy in the important things and governmental force in the little things. She hadn\u0027t liked its assaults of bad weather, its scars over the land, its wasteful ocean. She had returned to Rotor with an overwhelming gratitude, and with a new husband to whom she had tried to sell her dear little turning world - to make its orderly comfort as pleasant to him as it was to her, who had been born into it.\n But he had only been conscious of its smallness. \u0027You run out of it in six months,\u0027 he had said.\n She herself hadn\u0027t held his interest for much longer than that. Oh well-\n It would work itself out. Not for her. Eugenia Insigna was lost for ever between worlds. But for the children. Eugenia had been born to Rotor and could live without Earth. Marlene had been born - or almost born - to Rotor alone and could live without the Solar System, except for the vague feeling that she had originated there. Her children would not know even that, and would not care. To them, Earth and the Solar System would be a matter of myth, and Erythro would have become a rapidly developing world.\n She hoped so. Marlene had this odd fixation on Erythro already, though it had only developed in the last few months and might leave just as quickly as it had come.\n Altogether, it would be the height of ingratitude to complain. No-one could possibly have imagined a habitable world in orbit about Nemesis. The conditions that created habitability were remarkable. Estimate those probabilities and throw in the nearness of Nemesis to the Solar System and you would have to deny that it could possibly have happened.\n She turned to the day\u0027s reports, which the computer was waiting, with the infinite patience of its tribe, to give her.\n Yet before she could ask, her receptionist signaled and a soft voice came from the small button-speaker pinned to the left shoulder of her garment, \u0027Aurinel Pampas wishes to see you. He has no appointment.\u0027\n Insigna grimaced, then remembered that she had sent him after Marlene. She said, \u0027Let him come in.\u0027\n She cast a quick look at the mirror. She could see that her appearance was reasonable. To herself, she seemed to look younger than her forty-two years. She hoped she looked the same way to others.\n It seemed silly to worry about her appearance because a seventeen-year-old boy was about to enter, but Eugenia Insigna had seen poor Marlene looking at that boy and she knew what that look portended. It didn\u0027t seem to Insigna that Aurinel, who was so fond of his own appearance, would ever think of Marlene, who had never been able to rid herself of her childhood pudginess, in any way other than as an amusing child. Still, if Marlene had to face failure in this, let her not feel that her mother had contributed to that failure in any way and had been anything but charming to the boy.\n She\u0027ll blame me anyway, thought Insigna with a sigh, as the boy walked in with a smile that had not yet outgrown its adolescent shyness.\n \u0027Well, Aurinel,\u0027 she said. \u0027Did you find Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, ma\u0027am. Right where you said she\u0027d be, and I told her you wanted her out of there.\u0027\n \u0027And how is she feeling?\u0027\n \u0027If you want to know, Dr Insigna - I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s depression or something else, but she has a rather funny idea in her head. I don\u0027t know that she\u0027d like my telling you about it.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I don\u0027t like setting spies on her either, but she frequently has strange ideas and she worries me. Please tell me what she said.\u0027\n Aurinel shook his head. \u0027All right, but don\u0027t tell her I said anything. This one is really crazy. She said that Earth was going to be destroyed.\u0027\n He waited for Insigna to laugh.\n She did not. Instead, she exploded. \u0027What? What made her say that?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, Dr Insigna. She\u0027s a very bright kid, you know, but she gets these funny ideas. Or she may have been putting me on.\u0027\n Insigna cut in. \u0027She may have been doing exactly that. She has a strange sense of humor. So listen, I don\u0027t want you to repeat this to anyone else. I don\u0027t want silly stories to get started. Do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027Certainly, ma\u0027am.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m serious. Not a word.\u0027\n Aurinel nodded briskly.\n \u0027But thanks for telling me, Aurinel. It was important to do so. I\u0027ll speak to Marlene and find out what\u0027s bothering her - and I won\u0027t let her know you told me.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Aurinel. \u0027But just one thing, ma\u0027am.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\n \u0027Is Earth going to be destroyed?\u0027\n Insigna stared at him, then forced a laugh. \u0027Of course not! You may go now.\u0027\n Insigna looked after him and wished earnestly that she could have managed a more convincing denial.\n 3\n Janus Pitt made an impressive appearance, which had helped him in his rise to power as Commissioner of Rotor. In the early days of the formation of the Settlements, there had been a push for people of no more than average height. There had been thoughts of having a smaller per capita requirement for room and resources. Eventually, the caution had been deemed unnecessary and had been abandoned, but the bias was still there in the genes of the early Settlements and the average Rotorian remained a centimeter or two shorter than the average citizens of later Settlements.\n Pitt was tall, though, with iron gray hair, and a long face, and deep blue eyes, and a body that was still in good shape, despite the fact that he was fifty-six.\n Pitt looked up and smiled as Eugenia Insigna entered, but felt the usual small surge of uneasiness. There was something always uneasy-making about Eugenia, even wearying. She had these Causes (capital C) that were hard to deal with.\n \u0027Thank you for seeing me, Janus,\u0027 she said, \u0027on such short notice.\u0027\n Pitt placed his computer on hold, and leaned back in his chair, deliberately producing an air of relaxation.\n \u0027Come,\u0027 he said, \u0027there\u0027s no formality between us. We go back a long way.\u0027\n \u0027And have shared a great deal,\u0027 said Insigna.\n \u0027So we have,\u0027 said Pitt. \u0027And how is your daughter?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s about her I wish to speak, as a matter of fact. Are we shielded?\u0027\n Pitt\u0027s eyebrows arched. \u0027Why shielded? What is there to shield and from whom?\u0027\n The very question activated Pitt\u0027s realization of the odd position in which Rotor found itself. To all practical purposes, it was alone in the Universe. The Solar System was more than two light-years away, and no other intelligence-bearing worlds might exist within hundreds of light-years or, for all anyone knew, billions of light-years in any direction.\n Rotorians might have fits of loneliness and uncertainty, but they were free of any fear of outside interference. Well, almost any fear, thought Pitt.\n Insigna said, \u0027You know what there is to shield. It was you who have always insisted on secrecy.\u0027\n Pitt activated the shield and said, \u0027Are we to take that up again? Please, Eugenia, it\u0027s all settled. It was settled when we left fourteen years ago. I know that you brood about it now and then-\u0027\n \u0027Brood about it? Why not? It\u0027s my star,\u0027 and her arm flailed outward as if in the direction of Nemesis. \u0027It\u0027s my responsibility.\u0027\n Pitt\u0027s jaw tightened. Do we have to go through all this again? he thought.\n Aloud, he said, \u0027We\u0027re shielded. Now, what\u0027s bothering you?\u0027\n \u0027Marlene. My daughter. Somehow she knows.\u0027\n \u0027Knows what?\u0027\n \u0027About Nemesis and the Solar System.\u0027\n \u0027How could she know? Unless you\u0027ve told her?\u0027\n Insigna spread her arms helplessly. \u0027Of course I didn\u0027t tell her, but I don\u0027t have to. I don\u0027t know how it is, but somehow Marlene seems to hear and see everything. And from the little things she hears and sees, she works things out. She\u0027s always been able to do it, but in the last year it\u0027s grown much worse.\u0027\n \u0027Well then, she guesses, and sometimes she makes lucky guesses. Tell her she\u0027s wrong, and see that she doesn\u0027t talk about it.\u0027\n \u0027But she\u0027s already told a young man, who came to tell me. That\u0027s how I know. Aurinel Pampas. He\u0027s a friend of the family.\u0027\n \u0027Ah yes. I\u0027m aware of him - somewhat. Simply tell him not to listen to fantasies made up by a little girl.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s not a little girl. She\u0027s fifteen.\u0027\n \u0027To him, she\u0027s a little girl, I assure you. I said I\u0027m aware of the young man. I\u0027m under the impression he\u0027s pushing adulthood very hard and I remember, when I was his age, that fifteen-year-old girls were beneath contempt, especially if they were-\u0027\n Insigna said bitterly, \u0027I understand. Especially if they are short, plump, and plain. Does it matter that she\u0027s highly intelligent?\u0027\n \u0027To you and to me? Certainly. To Aurinel, certainly not. If necessary, I\u0027ll talk to the boy. You talk to Marlene. Tell her the idea is ridiculous, that it isn\u0027t true, and that she must not spread disturbing fairy tales.\u0027\n \u0027But what if it is true?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s beside the point. Look, Eugenia, you and I have concealed this possibility for years, and it would be better if we continued to conceal it. If it gets around, it will be exaggerated, and there will be rising sentiment about the matter - useless sentiment. It will only distract us from the job that has occupied our time ever since we left the Solar System, and which will continue to occupy us for generations, perhaps.\u0027\n She looked at him - shocked, unbelieving. \u0027Have you really no feeling for the Solar System, for Earth, the world on which humanity originated?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Eugenia, I have all sorts of feelings. But they\u0027re visceral and I can\u0027t let them sway me. We left the Solar System because we thought it was time for humanity to spread outward. Others, I\u0027m sure, will follow; maybe they are already doing so. We have made humanity a Galactic phenomenon and we mustn\u0027t think in terms of a single planetary system any more. Our job is here.\u0027\n They stared at each other, then Eugenia said, with a touch of hopelessness, \u0027You\u0027ll talk me down again. You\u0027ve talked me down for so many years.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but next year I\u0027ll have to again, and the year after. You won\u0027t stay down, Eugenia, and you tire me. The first time should have been enough.\u0027 And he turned away, back to his computer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-2.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
