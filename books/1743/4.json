Perhaps it was Marlene\u0027s increasing tendency to silence, to being withdrawn, to be always seeming to commune with thoughts too deep for speech.\n And sometimes the uneasy fear in Insigna was mixed with guilt: guilt because of her lack of motherly patience with the girl; guilt because of her too-great awareness of the girl\u0027s physical shortcomings. Marlene certainly didn\u0027t have her mother\u0027s conventional prettiness or her father\u0027s wildly unconventional good looks.\n Marlene was short and - blunt. That was the only word that Insigna could find that exactly fit poor Marlene.\n And poor, of course. It was the adjective she almost always used in her own mind and could just barely keep out of her speech.\n Short. Blunt. Thick without being fat, that was Marlene. Nothing graceful about her. Her hair was dark brown, rather long, and quite straight. Her nose was a little bulbous, her mouth turned down just a bit at the ends, her chin small, her whole attitude passive and turned in upon itself.\n There were her eyes, of course, large and lustrously dark, with meticulous dark eyebrows that curved above them, long eyelashes that looked almost artificial. Still, eyes alone could not make up for everything else, however fascinating they might be at odd moments.\n Insigna had known since Marlene was five that she was unlikely ever to attract a man on the physical plane alone, and that had become more obvious with each year.\n Aurinel had kept a languid eye on her during her preteen years, obviously attracted to her precocious intelligence and her almost luminous understanding. And Marlene had been shy and pleased in his presence, as though dimly realizing that there was something about an object called a \u0027boy\u0027 that was somehow endearing, but not knowing what it might be.\n In the last couple of years, it seemed to Insigna that Marlene had finally clarified in her mind what \u0027boy\u0027 meant. Her omnivorous reading of books and viewing of films too old for her body, if not her mind, undoubtedly helped her in this, but Aurinel had grown older, too, and as his hormones began to exert their sway over him, it was no longer badinage he was in search of.\n At dinner that night, Insigna asked, \u0027What kind of day did you have, dear?\u0027\n \u0027A quiet one. Aurinel came looking for me and I suppose he reported to you. I\u0027m sorry you have to take the trouble to hunt me down.\u0027\n Insigna sighed. \u0027But, Marlene, I can\u0027t help but think sometimes that you\u0027re unhappy and isn\u0027t it natural for me to be concerned about that? You\u0027re alone too much.\u0027\n \u0027I like to be alone.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t act it. You show no signs of happiness at being alone. There are many people who would like to be friendly and you would be happier if you allowed them to be. Aurinel is your friend.\u0027\n \u0027Was. He\u0027s all busy these days with other people. Today that was obvious. It infuriated me. Imagine him getting all wrapped up because he was thinking about Dolorette.\u0027\n Insigna said, \u0027You can\u0027t quite blame Aurinel, you know. Dolorette is his age.\u0027\n \u0027Physically,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027What a bubblehead.\u0027\n \u0027Physically counts a great deal at his age.\u0027\n \u0027He shows it. It makes a bubblehead out of him, too. The more he slobbers over Dolorette, the emptier his head gets. I can tell.\u0027\n \u0027But he\u0027ll keep on getting older, Marlene, and when he\u0027s a little older, he might find out what the really important things are. And you\u0027ll be getting older, too, you know-\u0027\n Marlene stared at Insigna quizzically. Then she said, \u0027Come on, Mother. You don\u0027t believe what you\u0027re trying to imply. You don\u0027t believe it for a minute.\u0027\n Insigna flushed. It suddenly occurred to her that Marlene wasn\u0027t guessing. She knew - but how did she know? Insigna had made her remark as sincerely as she could, had tried to feel it. But Marlene had seen through it without effort. It wasn\u0027t the first time either. Insigna had begun to feel that Marlene weighed the inflections, the hesitations, the motions, and always knew what you didn\u0027t want her to know. It must be this quality that made Insigna increasingly frightened of Marlene. You don\u0027t want to be glass to another\u0027s scornful glance.\n What had Insigna said, for instance, that had led Marlene to believe the Earth was doomed to destruction? That would have to be taken up and discussed.\n Insigna suddenly felt tired. If she couldn\u0027t ever fool Marlene, why try? She said, \u0027Well, let\u0027s get down to it, dear. What is it you want?\u0027\n Marlene said, \u0027I see you really want to know, so I\u0027ll tell you. I want to get away.\u0027\n \u0027Get away?\u0027 Insigna found herself unable to understand the simple words her daughter had used. \u0027Where is there to get away to?\u0027\n \u0027Rotor isn\u0027t all there is, Mother.\u0027\n \u0027Of course not. But it\u0027s all there is within more than two light-years.\u0027\n \u0027No, Mother, that\u0027s not so. Less than two thousand kilometers away is Erythro.\u0027\n \u0027That scarcely counts. You can\u0027t live there.\u0027\n \u0027There are people living there.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but under a Dome. A group of scientists and engineers live there because they are doing necessary scientific work. The Dome is much smaller than Rotor. If you feel cramped here, what will you feel there?\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s a whole world on Erythro outside the Dome. Someday people will spread out and live all over the planet.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe. It\u0027s by no means a certain thing.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sure it is a certain thing.\u0027\n \u0027Even if it is, it would take centuries.\u0027\n \u0027But it has to begin. Why can\u0027t I be part of the beginning?\u0027\n \u0027Marlene, you\u0027re being ridiculous. You\u0027ve got a very comfortable home here. When did all this start?\u0027\n Marlene pressed her lips together, then said, \u0027I\u0027m not sure. A few months ago, but it\u0027s getting worse. I just can\u0027t stand it here on Rotor.\u0027\n Insigna looked at her daughter, frowning. She thought: She feels she has lost Aurinel, she is heartbroken for ever, she will leave and punish him by doing so. She will send herself into exile on a barren world, and he will be sorry-\n Yes, that line of thought was entirely possible. She remembered when she herself was fifteen. Hearts are so fragile then that a slight tap will crack them. Teenagers heal quickly, but no fifteen-year-old would or could believe that at the time. Fifteen! It is later, later that-\n No use thinking about it!\n She said, \u0027What is it that attracts you about Erythro, Marlene?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s a large world. Isn\u0027t it natural to want a large world\u0027 - she hesitated, before adding the last two words, but she gulped them out somehow - \u0027like Earth?\u0027\n \u0027Like Earth!\u0027 Insigna spoke with vehemence. \u0027You\u0027ve never been on Earth. You don\u0027t know anything about Earth!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve seen a great deal about it, Mother. The libraries are full of films about Earth!\u0027\n (Yes, they were. Pitt had felt for some time now that such films ought to be sequestered - or even destroyed. He maintained that to break away from the Solar System meant to break away; it was wrong to maintain an artificial romanticism about Earth. Insigna had disagreed strongly, but now she suddenly thought that she could see Pitt\u0027s point.)\n She said, \u0027Marlene, you can\u0027t go by those films. They idealize things. They talk about the long past for the most part, when things on Earth were better, and, even so, it was never as good as they picture things to have been.\u0027\n \u0027Even so.\u0027\n \u0027No, not \"even so.\" Do you know what Earth is like? It\u0027s an unlivable slum. That\u0027s why people have left it to form all the Settlements. People went from the large dreadful world of Earth to small civilized Settlements. No-one wants to go in the other direction.\u0027\n \u0027There are billions of people who still live on Earth.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what makes it an unlivable slum. Those who are there leave as soon as they can. That\u0027s why so many Settlements have been built and are so crowded. That\u0027s why we left the Solar System for here, darling.\u0027\n Marlene said in a lower voice, \u0027Father was an Earth-man. He didn\u0027t leave Earth, even though he might have.\u0027\n \u0027No, he didn\u0027t. He stayed behind.\u0027 She frowned, trying to keep her voice level.\n \u0027Why, Mother?\u0027\n \u0027Come, Marlene. We\u0027ve talked about this. Many people stayed home. They didn\u0027t want to leave a familiar place. Almost every family on Rotor had stay-on-Earths. You know that very well. Do you want to return to Earth? Is that it?\u0027\n \u0027No, Mother. Not at all.\u0027\n \u0027Even if you wanted to go, you\u0027re over two light-years away and you can\u0027t go. Surely you understand that.\u0027\n \u0027Of course I understand that. I was just trying to point out that we have another Earth right here. It\u0027s Erythro. That\u0027s where I want to go; that\u0027s where I long to go.\u0027\n Insigna couldn\u0027t stop herself. It was almost with horror that she heard herself say, \u0027So you want to break away from me, as your father did.\u0027\n Marlene flinched, then recovered. She said, \u0027Is it really true, Mother, that he broke away from you? Perhaps things might have been different if you had behaved differently.\u0027 Then she added quietly, just as though she were announcing that she was done with dinner. \u0027You drove him away, didn\u0027t you, Mother?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-4.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
