He had glanced at it every once in a while and would see a bright after-image. Tessa Wendel, who was in a state of despair over developments, had scolded and spoken of retinal damage, so he had opacified the viewport and had brought the brightness of the star down to just bearable levels. That dimmed the other stars to a downcast, tarnished glitter.\n The bright star was the Sun, of course.\n It was farther away than any human being had ever seen it (except for the people of Rotor on their journey away from the Solar System). It was twice as far away as one would see it from Pluto at its farthest, so that it showed no orb and shone with the appearance of a star. Nevertheless, it was still a hundred times the brightness of the full Moon as seen from Earth, and that hundredfold brightness was condensed and compacted into one brilliant point. No wonder one still couldn\u0027t bear to turn a direct and unflinching gaze upon it through an un-opacified glass.\n It made things different. The sun, ordinarily, was nothing to wonder at. It was too bright to look at, too unrivaled in its position. The minor portion of its light that was scattered into blueness by the atmosphere was sufficient to blank out the other stars altogether, and even where the stars were not blanked out (as on the Moon, for instance) they were so overridden by the Sun that there was no thought of comparison.\n Here, so far out in space, the Sun had dimmed at least to the point where comparison was possible. Wendel had said that from this vantage point, the Sun was one hundred and sixty thousand times as bright as Sirius, which was the next brightest object in the sky. It was perhaps twenty million times as bright as the dimmest stars he could see by eye. It made the Sun seem more marvelous by comparison than when it shone, uncompared, in Earth\u0027s sky.\n Nor did he have much more to do than watch the sky, for the Superluminal was merely drifting. It had been doing that for two days - two days of drifting through space at mere rocket velocities.\n At this speed it would take thirty-five thousand years to reach the Neighbor Star - if they had been heading in the right direction. And they weren\u0027t.\n It was this that had turned Wendel, two days earlier, into a picture of white-faced despair.\n Until then, there had been no trouble. When they were due to enter hyperspace, Fisher had tensed himself, fearing the possible pain, the piercing flash of agony, the sudden surge of eternal darkness.\n None of that had happened. It had all been too fast to experience. They had entered into and emerged from hyperspace in the same instant. The stars had simply blinked into a different pattern with no perceptible moment in which they had lost their first pattern, yet not gained their second.\n It was relief in a double sense. Not only was he still alive, but he realized that if something had gone wrong and he had died, then death would have come in such a no-time way that he could not possibly have experienced death. He would simply have been dead.\n The relief was so keen that he was scarcely aware that Tessa had let out a gasp of disturbance and pain, and dashed out to the engine room with an outcry.\n She came back looking disheveled - not a hair out of place, but looking internally disheveled. Her eyes were wild and she stared at Fisher as though she did not really recognize him.\n She said, \u0027The pattern should not have changed.\u0027\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027We haven\u0027t moved far enough. Or shouldn\u0027t have. Only one and a third milli-light-years. That would not have been enough to alter the star pattern to the unaided eye. However\u0027 - she drew a deep, shuddering breath -\u0027it\u0027s not as bad as it might have been. I thought we had slipped and moved out thousands of light-years.\u0027\n \u0027Would that have been possible, Tessa?\u0027\n \u0027Of course it would have been possible. If our passage through hyperspace weren\u0027t tightly controlled, a thousand light-years is as easy as one.\u0027\n \u0027In that case, we can as easily just go-\u0027\n Wendel anticipated the conclusion. \u0027No, we couldn\u0027t just go back. If our controls were that slipshod, every pass we would make would be uncontrolled travel, ending at some random point, and we\u0027d never find our way back.\u0027\n Fisher frowned. The euphoria of having passed through hyperspace and back - and stayed alive - began to leak away. \u0027But when you sent out test objects, you brought them back safely.\u0027\n \u0027They were far less massive and were sent out through far shorter distances. But, as I said, it\u0027s not too bad. It turns out we went the correct distance. The stars are in the correct pattern.\u0027\n \u0027But they changed. I saw them change.\u0027\n \u0027Because we\u0027re oriented differently. The long axis of the ship has veered through an angle of better than twenty-eight degrees. In short, we followed a curved path rather than a straight one for some reason.\u0027\n The stars, as seen through the viewport, were moving now, slowly, steadily.\n Wendel said, \u0027We\u0027re turning to face the Neighbor Star again, just for the psychological value of facing in the right direction, but then we must find out why we curved in passage.\u0027\n The bright star, the beacon star, the star of brilliance entered the viewport and moved across it. Fisher blinked.\n \u0027That\u0027s the Sun,\u0027 said Wendel, answering Fisher\u0027s look of astonishment.\n Fisher said, \u0027Are there any reasonable explanations why the ship curved in passage? If Rotor also curved, who knows where they ended?\u0027\n \u0027Or where we will end either. Because I don\u0027t have any reasonable explanation. Not right now.\u0027 She looked at him, clearly troubled. \u0027If our assumptions were correct, then we should have changed position but not direction. We should have moved in a straight line, a Euclidean straight line, despite the relativistic curve of space-time, because we weren\u0027t in space-time, you see. There may be a mistake in the programming of the computer - or a mistake in our assumptions. I hope the former. That can be corrected easily.\u0027\n Five hours passed. Wendel came in, rubbing her eyes. Fisher looked up uncomfortably. He had been viewing a film, but had lost interest. He had then watched the stars, allowing the patterns to hypnotize him, like anesthesia.\n He said, \u0027Well, Tessa?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing wrong with the programming, Crile.\u0027\n \u0027Then the assumptions must be wrong?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but in what way? There are an infinite number of assumptions we might make. Which are correct? We can\u0027t try them one after another. We\u0027d never finish, and we\u0027d be hopelessly lost.\u0027\n Silence fell between them for a while and then Wendel said, \u0027If it had been the programming, it would have been a stupid mistake. We would have corrected it, without learning anything, but we\u0027d have been safe. But now, if we must go back to fundamentals, we have a chance of discovering something really important, but if we fail, we may never find our way back.\u0027\n She snatched at Fisher\u0027s hand. \u0027Do you understand, Crile? Something is wrong and if we don\u0027t find out what, there\u0027s no way - except sheer incredible accident - that will allow us to find our way home. No matter how we try, we may continue to end up in the wrong place, and find ourselves steadily wronger and wronger. Which means death eventually, when our cycling fails, or our power supply peters out, or deep despair drains away our ability to live. And it\u0027s I who\u0027ve done this to you. But the real tragedy would be the loss of a dream. If we don\u0027t come back, they\u0027ll never know if the ship was successful at all. They might conclude the transition was fatal and they might never try again.\u0027\n \u0027But they must if they expect to escape from Earth.\u0027\n \u0027They may give up; they may sit cowering, waiting for the Neighbor Star to complete its approach and pass on, and dying bit by bit.\u0027 She looked up, her eyes blinking rapidly, her face looking terribly tired. \u0027And it would be the end of your dream, too, Crile.\u0027\n Crile\u0027s lips tightened, and he said nothing.\n Almost timidly, Wendel said, \u0027But for years now, Crile, you\u0027ve had me. If your daughter - your dream - is gone, was I enough?\u0027\n \u0027I might ask: If superluminal flight is gone, was I enough?\u0027\n There seemed no easy answer on either side, but then Wendel said, \u0027You\u0027re second-best, Crile, but it has been a good second-best. Thank you.\u0027\n Fisher stirred. \u0027You speak for me, too, Tessa, something I wouldn\u0027t have believed at the start. If I had never had a daughter, there would have only been you. I almost wish-\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t wish that. Second-best is enough.\u0027\n And they held hands. Quietly. And gazed out at the stars.\n Until Merry Blankowitz poked her face through the doorway. \u0027Captain Wendel, Wu has an idea. He said he had it all along, but was reluctant to mention it.\u0027\n Wendel started to her feet. \u0027Why was he reluctant?\u0027\n \u0027He said he once suggested the possibility to you, and you told him not to be a fool.\u0027\n \u0027Did I? And what has convinced him that I\u0027m never wrong? I\u0027ll listen to it now and if it\u0027s a good idea, I\u0027ll break his neck for not forcing it on me earlier.\u0027\n And she hurried out.\n 72\n Fisher could only wait during the day and a half that followed. They all ate together as they always did, but silently. Fisher did not know if any of them slept. He slept only in snatches, and woke to renewed despair.\n How long can we go on like this? he thought on the second day, as he looked at the beauty of that unattainable bright dot in the sky that, so brief a time ago, had warmed him and lighted his way on Earth.\n Sooner or later, they would die. Modern space technology would prolong life. Recycling was quite efficient. Even food would last a long time if they were willing to accept the tasteless algae cake they would end up with. The micro-fusion motors would dribble out energy for a long time, too. But surely no-one would want to prolong life through the full time that the ship would make possible.\n With a lingering, dragging, hopeless, lonely death finally certain, the rational way out would be to use the adjustable de-metabolizers.\n That was the preferred method for suicide on Earth; why should it not be onboard ship as well? You could - if you wished - adjust the dose for a full day of reasonably normal life, live it out as joyously as you could - a known last day. At the end of the day, you would grow naturally sleepy. You would yawn and release your hold on wakefulness, passing into a peaceful sleep of restful dreams. The sleep would slowly deepen, the dreams would slowly fade, and you would not wake up. No kinder death had ever been invented.\n And then, Tessa, just before 5 p.m., ship-time, on the second day after the transition that had curved instead of being straight, burst into the room. Her eyes were wild and she was breathing hard. Her dark hair, which, in the last year had become liberally salted with gray, was mussed.\n Fisher rose in consternation. \u0027Bad?\u0027\n \u0027No, good!\u0027 she said, throwing herself into a chair rather than sitting down.\n Fisher wasn\u0027t sure he had heard correctly, wasn\u0027t sure that perhaps she might only have been speaking ironically. He stared at her and watched her as she visibly gathered herself together.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 she repeated. \u0027Very good! Extraordinary! Crile, you\u0027re looking at an idiot. I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ll ever recover from this.\u0027\n \u0027Well, what happened?\u0027\n \u0027Chao-Li Wu had the answer. He had it all along. He told me. I remember him telling me. Months ago. Maybe a year ago. I dismissed it. I didn\u0027t even listen, really.\u0027 She paused to catch her breath. Her excitement had completely disoriented the natural rhythm of her speech.\n She said, \u0027The trouble was that I thought of myself as the world authority on superluminal flight, and was convinced that no-one could possibly tell me anything I didn\u0027t know or hadn\u0027t thought of. And if someone did suggest something that seemed strange to me, the idea was simply wrong, and, presumably, idiotic. Do you know what I mean?\u0027\n Fisher said grimly, \u0027I\u0027ve met people like that.\u0027\n \u0027Everyone\u0027s like that, now and then,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027given certain conditions. I suppose aging scientists are particularly like that. That\u0027s why the daring young revolutionaries of science become old fossils after a few decades. Their imaginations harden with encrusted self-love and that\u0027s their end. It is now my end... But enough of that. It took us over a day to really work it out, to adjust the equations, to program the computer and set up the necessary simulations, to go down blind alleys and catch ourselves. It should have taken a week, but we were all driving each other like maniacs.\u0027\n Wendel paused here, as if to catch her breath. Fisher waited for her to continue, nodding encouragement as he reached out to grasp her hand.\n \u0027This is complex,\u0027 she continued. \u0027Let me try to explain. Look- We go from one point in space through hyperspace to another point in space in zero time. But there\u0027s a path we take to do that, and it\u0027s a different path each time, depending on the starting and ending points. We don\u0027t observe the path, we don\u0027t experience it, we don\u0027t actually follow it in space-time fashion. It exists in a rather incomprehensible way. It\u0027s what we call a \"virtual path\". I worked out that concept myself.\u0027\n \u0027If you don\u0027t observe it, and don\u0027t experience it, how do you know it\u0027s there?\u0027\n \u0027Because it can be calculated by the equations we use to describe the motion through hyperspace. The equations give us the path.\u0027\n \u0027How can you possibly know that the equations are describing anything that has actual reality? It could be just - mathematics.\u0027\n \u0027It could be. I thought it was. I ignored it. It was Wu who suggested it might have significance - maybe a year ago - and like a full-grown idiot, I dismissed it. A virtual path, I said, had merely virtual existence. If it couldn\u0027t be measured, it was outside the realm of science. I was so shortsighted. I can\u0027t endure myself when I think of it.\u0027\n \u0027All right. Suppose the virtual path has some sort of existence. What then?\u0027\n \u0027In that case, if the virtual path is drawn near a sizable body, the ship experiences gravitational effects. That was the first breathtakingly true and useful new concept - that gravitation can make itself felt along the virtual path.\u0027 Wendel shook her fist angrily. \u0027I saw that myself, in a way, but I reasoned that since a ship would be moving at many times the speed of light, gravitation would have insufficient time to make itself felt to any measurable extent. Travel would therefore be, by my assumption, in a Euclidean straight line.\u0027\n \u0027But it wasn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Obviously not. And Wu explained it. Imagine that the speed of light is a zero point. All speeds less than that of light would have negative magnitude, and all speeds gre.ater than that of light would have positive magnitude. In the ordinary Universe we live in, therefore, all speeds would be negative, by that mathematical convention, and, in fact, must be negative.\n \u0027Now, the Universe is built on principles of symmetry. If something as fundamental as speed of movement is always negative, then something else, just as fundamental, ought to be always positive, and Wu suggested that that something else was gravitation. In the ordinary Universe, it is always an attraction. Every object with mass attracts every other object with mass.\n \u0027However, if something goes at a superluminal speed - that is, faster than light - then its speed is positive and the other something that was positive has to become negative. At superluminal speed, in other words, gravitation is a repulsive force. Every object with mass repels every other object with mass. Wu suggested that to me a long time ago and I wouldn\u0027t listen. His words just bounced off my eardrums.\u0027\n Crile said, \u0027But what\u0027s the difference, Tessa? When we\u0027re going at enormous superluminal speeds, and gravitational attraction doesn\u0027t have time to affect our motion, neither would gravitational repulsion.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, that\u0027s not so, Crile. That\u0027s the beauty of it. That reverses, too. In the ordinary Universe of negative speeds, the faster the speed relative to an attractive body, the less gravitational attraction affects the direction of movement. In the Universe of positive speeds, hyper-space, the faster we go relative to a repulsive body, the more gravitational repulsion affects the direction of movement. That makes no sense to us, since we\u0027re used to the situation as it exists in the ordinary Universe, but once you are forced to change signs from plus to minus and vice versa, you find these things falling into place.\u0027\n \u0027Mathematically. But how much can you trust the equations?\u0027\n \u0027You match your calculations against the facts. Gravitational attraction is the weakest of all the forces and so is the gravitational repulsion along the virtual paths. Within the ship and within us, every particle repels all other particles while we are in hyperspace, but that repulsion can do nothing against the other forces that hold it together and have not changed signs. However, our virtual path from Station Four to here carried us close to Jupiter. Its repulsion along the virtual hyperspatial path was just as intense as its attraction would have been along a nonvirtual spatial path.\n \u0027We calculated how Jupiter\u0027s gravitational repulsion would affect our path through hyperspace, and that path curved exactly as it had been observed to do. In other words, Wu\u0027s modification of my equations not only simplifies them, but it makes them work.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027And did you break Wu\u0027s neck, Tessa, as you promised you would?\u0027\n Wendel laughed, remembering her threat. \u0027No, I didn\u0027t. Actually, I kissed him.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t blame you.\u0027\n \u0027Of course, it\u0027s more important now than ever that we get back safely, Crile. This advance in superluminal flight must be reported, and Wu must be properly honored. He built on my work, I admit, but he went on to do what I might never have thought to do. I mean, consider the consequences.\u0027\n \u0027I can see them,\u0027 said Fisher.\n \u0027No, you can\u0027t,\u0027 said Wendel sharply. \u0027Now, listen to me. Rotor had no problems with gravitation because they merely skimmed the speed of light - a little below it at some times, a little above it at others - so that gravitational effects, whether positive or negative, attractive or repulsive, had immeasurably small effects on them. It was our own true superluminal flights at many times the speed of light that makes it imperative to take gravitational repulsion into account. My own equations are useless. They will get ships through hyperspace, but not in the right direction. And that\u0027s not all.\n \u0027I have always thought that there was a certain unavoidable danger in emerging from hyperspace - the second half of the transition. What if you merge into an already existing object? There would be a fantastic explosion that would destroy the ship and everything in it in a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.\n \u0027Naturally, we\u0027re not going to end up inside a star because we know where the stars are located and can avoid them. In time, we might even know where a star\u0027s planets are and avoid them, too. But there are asteroids by the tens of thousands and comets by the tens of billions in the neighborhood of every star. If we end up overlapping one of those, that would still be deadly.\n \u0027The only thing that would save us, in the situation as I had thought it to be before today, is the laws of chance. Space is so huge that the chance of striking any object larger than an atom or, at most, a grain of dust is extraordinarily small. Still, given enough trips through hyperspace, the overlapping of matter is a catastrophe just waiting to happen.\n \u0027But under conditions as we now know them to be, the chances are zero. Our ship and any sizable object would repel each other and tend to move apart. We are not likely to run afoul of anything deadly. They would all automatically move out of our path.\u0027\n Fisher scratched at his forehead. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t we move out of our path, too? Won\u0027t that upset our course unexpectedly?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but the small objects we are likely to encounter will alter our path in very limited fashion and we could easily make it up - a small price to pay for safety.\u0027\n Wendel took a deep breath and stretched luxuriantly. \u0027I feel great. What a sensation all this will make when we get back to Earth.\u0027\n Fisher chuckled. \u0027You know, Tessa, before you came in, I was building a morbid picture in my head of our being irretrievably lost; of our ship wandering for ever, with five dead bodies aboard; of its being found someday by intelligent beings who would mourn the obvious space tragedy-\u0027\n \u0027Well, it won\u0027t happen, you can count on that, my dear,\u0027 said Wendel, smiling, and they embraced. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-33.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
