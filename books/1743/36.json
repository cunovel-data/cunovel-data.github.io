{"id":70517,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"80 As noted before, Janus Pitt did not often allow himself the luxury of self-pity. In anyone else, he would consider such a thing a despicable sign of weakness and self-indulgence. There were, however, times when he sadly rebelled at the fact that the people of Rotor were only too willing to leave all of the unpleasant decisions to him. There was a Council, yes - duly elected, and meticulously involved in passing laws and in making decisions - all but the important ones, the ones that dealt with the future of Rotor. That was left to him. It was not even consciously left to him. The matters of importance were simply ignored, simply rendered nonexistent by mutual unspoken agreement. Here they were in an empty system, leisurely building new Settlements, absently convinced that time stretched infinitely before them. Everywhere was the calm assumption that once they had filled this new asteroid belt (generations from now, and a matter of no immediate concern to anyone presently alive) the hyper-assistance technique would have improved to the point where it would be comparatively easy to seek out and occupy new planets. Time existed in plenty. Time blended into eternity. Only to Pitt himself was it left to consider the fact that time was short, that at any given moment, without warning, time might come to an end. When would Nemesis be discovered back in the Solar System? When would some Settlement decide to follow Rotor\u0027s lead? It had to come someday. With Nemesis inexorably moving in the direction of the Sun, it would eventually reach that point - still far distant, of course, but close enough - at which the people of the Solar System would have to be blind not to see it. Pitt\u0027s computer, with the aid of a programmer who was convinced he was working out a problem of academic interest only, had estimated that by the end of a thousand years, the discovery of Nemesis would be inevitable, and that the Settlements would begin to disperse. Pitt had then put the question: Would the Settlements come to Nemesis? The answer was no. By that time, hyper-assistance would be far more efficient, far cheaper. The Settlements would know more about the nearer stars - which of them had planets, and what kind. They would not bother with a red dwarf star, but would head out for the Sun-like stars. And that would leave Earth itself, which would be desperate. Afraid of space, clearly degenerate already, and sinking farther into slime and misery as a thousand years passed and the doom of Nemesis became apparent, what would they do? They could not undertake long trips. They were Earthpeople. Surfacebound. They would have to wait for Nemesis to get reasonably close. They could not hope to go anywhere else. Pitt had the vision of a ramshackle world trying to find security in the more tightly held system of Nemesis, trying to find refuge in a star with a system built tightly enough together to hold in place while it was destroying that of the Sun it passed. It was a terrible scenario, and yet inevitable. Why could not Nemesis have been receding from the Sun? How everything would be changed. The discovery of Nemesis would have become somewhat less likely with time and, if the discovery came to pass, Nemesis would become ever less desirable - and less possible - as a place of refuge. If it were receding, Earth would not even need a refuge. But that was not the way it was. The Earthmen would come; ragtag degenerating Earthmen of every variety of makeshift and abnormal culture, flooding in. What could the Rotorians do but destroy them while they were still in space? But would they have a Janus Pitt to show them that there was no choice but that? Would they have Janus Pitts, between now and then, to make sure that Rotor had the weapons and the resolution to prepare for this and to do it when the time came? But the computer\u0027s analysis was, after all, a deceitfully optimistic one. The discovery of Nemesis by the Solar System must come about within a thousand years, said the computer. But how much within? What if the discovery came tomorrow? What if it had come three years ago? Might some Settlement, groping for the nearest star, knowing nothing useful about farther ones, be following in Rotor\u0027s trail now? Each day, Pitt woke up wondering: Is this the day? Why was this misery reserved for him? Why did everyone else sleep quietly in the lap of eternity, while only he himself was left to deal each day with the possibility of a kind of doom? He had done something about it, of course. He had set up a Scanning Service throughout the asteroid belt, a body whose function it was to supervise the automated receptors that constantly swept the sky, and to detect at as great a distance as possible the copious waste-energy disposal of an approaching Settlement. It had taken some time to set it all up properly, but for a dozen years now, every scrap of dubious information had been followed up, and, every once in a while, something seemed sufficiently questionable to be referred to Pitt. And every time it happened, it set off the clanging of an alarm bell in Pitt\u0027s head. It turned out always to be nothing - so far - and the initial relief was always followed by a kind of rage against the Scanners. If anything was uncertain, they washed their hands of it, let it go, turned it over to Pitt. Let him deal with it, let him suffer, let him make the hard decisions. It was at this point that Pitt\u0027s self-pity became lachrymose, and he would begin to stir uneasily at the possibility that he might be showing weakness. There was this one, for instance. Pitt fingered the report that his computer had uncoded, and that had inspired this mental self-pitying survey of his own continuous, unbearable and underappreciated service to the Rotorian people. This was the first report that had been referred to him in four months, and it seemed to him that it was of minimal importance. A suspicious energy source was approaching, but allowing for its probable distance, it was an unusually small source - a smaller source by some four orders of magnitude than one would expect of a Settlement. It was a source so small that it was all but inseparable from noise. They might have spared him this. The report that it was of a peculiar wavelength pattern that seemed to make it of human origin was ridiculous. How could they tell anything about a source so weak - except that it was not a Settlement, and therefore could not be of human origin, whatever the wavelength pattern? Those idiot Scanners must not annoy me in this fashion, thought Pitt. He tossed the report aside petulantly, and picked up the latest report from Ranay D\u0027Aubisson. That girl Marlene did not have the Plague, even yet. She madly persisted in putting herself in danger in more and more elaborate ways - and yet remained unharmed. Pitt sighed. Perhaps it didn\u0027t matter. The girl seemed to want to remain on Erythro, and if she remained, that might be as good as having her come down with the Plague. In fact, it would force Eugenia Insigna to stay on Erythro, too, and he would be rid of both of them. To be sure, he would feel safer if D\u0027Aubisson, rather than Genarr, were in charge of the Dome and could oversee both mother and daughter. That would have to be arranged in the near future in some way that would not make Genarr a martyr. Would it be safe to make him Commissioner of New Rotor? That would certainly rate as a promotion and he would be unlikely to refuse the position, especially since, in theory, it would place him on an even rank with Pitt himself. Or would that give Genarr a bit too much of the reality of power in addition to the appearance? Was there an alternative? He would have to think of it. Ridiculous! How much easier it would all have been if that girl Marlene had only done something as simple as getting the Plague. In a spasm of irritation at Marlene\u0027s refusal to do so, he picked up the report on the energy source again. Look at that! A little puff of energy and they bothered him with it. He wasn\u0027t going to stand for it. He punched a memo into the computer for instant transmission. He was not to be bothered by minutiae. Keep an eye out for a Settlement! 81 Onboard the Superluminal, the discoveries came like a series of hammer blows, one after the other. They were still at a great distance from the Neighbor Star when it became apparent that it possessed a planet. \u0027A planet!\u0027 said Crile Fisher with tense triumph. \u0027I knew-\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Tessa Wendel hastily, \u0027it\u0027s not what you think. Get it through your head, Crile, that there are planets and planets. Virtually every star has some sort of planetary system or other. After all, more than half the stars in the Galaxy are multiple-star systems, and planets are just stars that are too small to be stars, you see. This planet we see isn\u0027t habitable. If it were habitable, we wouldn\u0027t see it at this distance, especially in the dim light of the Neighbor Star.\u0027 \u0027You mean, it\u0027s a gas giant.\u0027 \u0027Of course it is. I would have been more surprised if there hadn\u0027t been one than at finding out that one exists.\u0027 \u0027But if there\u0027s a large planet, there may be small planets, too.\u0027 \u0027Maybe,\u0027 conceded Wendel, \u0027but scarcely habitable ones. They\u0027ll either be too cold for life, or their rotation will be locked and they\u0027ll be showing only one side to the star, which would make it too warm on one side and too cold on the other. All that Rotor could do - if it were here - would be to place itself in orbit around the star, or possibly around the gas giant.\u0027 \u0027That might be exactly what they\u0027ve done.\u0027 \u0027For all these years?\u0027 Wendel shrugged. \u0027It\u0027s conceivable, I suppose, but you can\u0027t count on it, Crile.\u0027 82 The next blows were more startling ones. \u0027A satellite?\u0027 said Tessa Wendel. \u0027Well, why not? Jupiter has four sizable ones. Why should it be surprising that this gas giant has one?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not a satellite like any that exists in the Solar System, Captain,\u0027 said Henry Jarlow. \u0027It\u0027s roughly the size of Earth - from the measurements I\u0027ve been able to make.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Wendel, maintaining her indifference, \u0027what follows from that?\u0027 \u0027Nothing, necessarily,\u0027 said Jarlow, \u0027but the satellite shows peculiar characteristics. I wish I were an astronomer.\u0027 \u0027At the moment,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027I wish someone on the ship was, but please go on. You\u0027re not completely ignorant of astronomy.\u0027 \u0027The point is that since it revolves around the gas giant, it shows one face only to the gas giant, which means that all sides of it face the Neighbor Star in the course of its revolution around the gas giant. And the nature of the orbit is such that, as near as I can tell, the temperature of the world is in the liquid-water stage. And it has an atmosphere. Now I don\u0027t have all the subtleties at my fingertips. As I said, I\u0027m not an astronomer. Still, it seems to me that there\u0027s a good chance that the satellite is a habitable world.\u0027 Crile Fisher received the news with a wide smile. He said, \u0027I\u0027m not surprised. Igor Koropatsky predicted the existence of a habitable planet. He did it without any data on the subject. It was just a matter of deduction.\u0027 \u0027Did Koropatsky do that? And when did he talk to you, I wonder?\u0027 \u0027Some time before we left. He reasoned that nothing was likely to have happened to Rotor on the way to the Neighbor Star and, since they didn\u0027t return, that they must have found a planet to colonize. And there it is.\u0027 \u0027And just why did he tell you this, Crile?\u0027 Crile paused and considered, then said, \u0027He was interested in making certain that the planet would be explored for possible future use by Earth, when the time came for our old planet to be evacuated.\u0027 \u0027And why do you suppose he didn\u0027t tell me this? Do you have any idea?\u0027 \u0027I suppose, Tessa,\u0027 said Crile carefully, \u0027that he thought I would be the more impressionable of the two of us, more eager to urge that the planet be explored-\u0027 \u0027Because of your daughter.\u0027 \u0027He knew of the situation, Tessa.\u0027 \u0027And why didn\u0027t you tell me this?\u0027 \u0027I wasn\u0027t sure there was anything to tell. I felt that I might as well wait and see if Koropatsky was right. Since he was, I am now telling you. The planet must be habitable by his reasoning.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a satellite,\u0027 said Wendel, obviously in a temper. \u0027A distinction without a difference.\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027Look, Crile. No-one seems to be considering my position in all this. Koropatsky fills you full of nonsense in order to have us explore this system and then, presumably, return to Earth with the news. Wu was anxious to have us return with news even before we reached this system. You are anxious for a reunion with your family, regardless of any wider considerations. In all this, there seems to be very little thought given to the fact that I\u0027m the Captain and that I will make the decisions.\u0027 Fisher\u0027s voice grew cajoling. \u0027Be reasonable, Tessa. What decisions are there to make? What are your choices? You say Koropatsky filled me with nonsense, but he didn\u0027t. There\u0027s the planet. Or the satellite - if you prefer. It must be explored. Its existence may mean life for Earth. This may be humanity\u0027s future home. In fact, some of humanity may be there already.\u0027 \u0027You be reasonable, Crile. A world can be the right size and temperature and still be uninhabitable for any of a variety of reasons. After all, suppose it has a poisonous atmosphere, or is incredibly volcanic, or has a high level of radioactivity. It has only a red dwarf star to light and warm it, and it is in the immediate neighborhood of a large gas giant. That is not a normal environment for an Earth-type world, and how will such an abnormal environment affect it?\u0027 \u0027It must still be explored, even if only to find out, certainly, that it is uninhabitable.\u0027 \u0027For that it may not be necessary to land,\u0027 said Wendel grimly. \u0027We\u0027ll get closer and judge better. Try, Crile, please try not to outrun the data. I couldn\u0027t bear your disappointment.\u0027 Fisher nodded. \u0027I\u0027ll try- Yet Koropatsky deduced a habitable planet when everyone else told me it was totally impossible. You did, too, Tessa. Over and over. But there it is and it may be habitable. So let me hope while I can. Perhaps the people of Rotor are now on that world, and perhaps my daughter is, too.\u0027 83 Chao-Li Wu said rather indifferently, \u0027The Captain is really furious. The last thing she wanted was to find a planet here - a world, I mean, since she won\u0027t allow us to call it a planet - that may be habitable. It means it will have to be explored and we\u0027ll just have to go back and report. You know that\u0027s not what she wants. This is her one and only chance to be out in deep space. Once this is over, she\u0027s through for life. Others will work on superluminal techniques; others will explore space. She\u0027ll be retired to an advisory position only. She\u0027ll hate it.\u0027 \u0027How about you, Chao-Li? Would you go out in space again, given a chance?\u0027 Blankowitz asked. Wu didn\u0027t hesitate. \u0027I\u0027m not sure that I want to go wandering around in space. I don\u0027t have the exploring bug. But you know- Last night, I got the queer notion I might just like to settle down here - if it\u0027s habitable. How about you?\u0027 \u0027Settle down here? Of course not. I don\u0027t say I\u0027d like to be Earthbound for ever, but I\u0027d like to be back there for a while, anyway, before striking out again.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about it. This satellite is one in - what? Ten thousand? Who would figure on a habitable world in a red dwarf system? It should be explored. I\u0027m even willing to spend time on it and have someone else go back to Earth and take care of my priority on the gravitational effect. You\u0027d protect my interests, wouldn\u0027t you, Merry?\u0027 \u0027Of course I would, Ghao-Li. And so would Captain Wendel. She has all the data, signed and witnessed.\u0027 \u0027So there you are. And I think the Captain is wrong to want to explore the Galaxy. She could visit a hundred stars and not see one world as unusual as this one. Why bother with quantity when you\u0027ve got quality right in hand?\u0027 \u0027Personally,\u0027 said Blankowitz, \u0027I think that what bothers her is Fisher\u0027s kid. What if he finds her?\u0027 \u0027So what? He can take her back to Earth with him. What would that be to the Captain?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a wife involved, too, you know.\u0027 \u0027Do you ever hear him mention her?\u0027 \u0027That wouldn\u0027t mean he-\u0027 Her mouth closed suddenly at the sound outside, and Crile Fisher walked in and nodded at the two. Blankowitz said quickly, as though to wipe out the previous conversation, \u0027Has Henry finished with the spectroscopy?\u0027 Fisher shook his head. \u0027I can\u0027t tell. The poor fellow is nervous. He\u0027s afraid of misinterpreting the thing, I suppose.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Come on. It\u0027s the computer that does the interpretation. He can hide behind that.\u0027 \u0027No, he can\u0027t!\u0027 said Blankowitz with fervor. \u0027I like that. You theoreticians think that all we observers do is just tend a computer, give it a stroke or two, andsay, \"Nicedoggie,\" then read off the results. It\u0027s not so. What the computer says depends on what you put into it, and I never heard a theoretician face an observation he didn\u0027t like without blaming the observer. Never once did I hear him say, \"There must be something wrong with the compu-\" \u0027 \u0027Hold on,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027Let\u0027s not flood this place with recrimination. Have you ever heard me blaming observers?\u0027 \u0027If you didn\u0027t like Henry\u0027s observations-\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d take them anyway. I don\u0027t have any theories about this world.\u0027 \u0027And that\u0027s why you\u0027d take whatever he gives you.\u0027 At this point Henry Jarlow walked in with Tessa Wendel close behind. He looked like a cloud making up its mind to rain. Wendel said, \u0027Very well, Jarlow, we\u0027re all here. Now, tell us. What does it look like?\u0027 \u0027The trouble is,\u0027 said Jarlow, \u0027there isn\u0027t enough ultraviolet in the light of this weakling star to raise a sunburn on an albino. I have to work with micro-waves and that tells me, at once, that there\u0027s water vapor in the world\u0027s atmosphere.\u0027 Wendel shrugged it off with an impatient lift of her shoulders. \u0027We don\u0027t need you to tell us that. A world the size of Earth in a liquid-water range of temperature would surely have water and, therefore, water vapor. That moves it one more notch toward habitability, but only one more thoroughly expected notch.\u0027 \u0027Oh no,\u0027 said Jarlow uneasily. \u0027It\u0027s habitable. No question.\u0027 \u0027Because of the water vapor?\u0027 \u0027No. I have something better than that.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 Jarlow looked around him at the other four rather grimly, and said, \u0027Would you say a world was habitable if, in actual fact, it was inhabited?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I think I could bring myself to say that,\u0027 said Wu calmly. \u0027Are you telling me that you can see that it\u0027s inhabited at this distance?\u0027 asked Wendel sharply. \u0027Yes, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m saying, Captain. There\u0027s free oxygen in the atmosphere - and in quantity. Can you tell me how that can be without photosynthesis? And can you tell me how you can have photosynthesis without the presence of life? And can you tell me how a planet can be uninhabitable if it has oxygen-producing life on it?\u0027 There was dead silence for a moment, then Wendel said, \u0027That is so unlikely, Jarlow. Are you sure you didn\u0027t mess up the programming?\u0027 And Blankowitz quietly raised her eyebrows at Wu in an unspoken: \u0027See-e-e-e-e!\u0027 Jarlow said stiffly, \u0027I have never messed up, as you call it, a programming in my life, but, of course, I\u0027m willing to stand corrected if anyone here feels he is more knowledgeable about atmospheric infrared analysis than I am. It\u0027s not my field of expertise, but I did make careful use of Blanc and Nkrumah on the subject.\u0027 Crile Fisher, who had gained considerable self-confidence since the incident involving Wu\u0027s bid to return home, did not hesitate to insert his views. \u0027Look,\u0027 he said, \u0027this will either be confirmed or denied as we get closer, but why don\u0027t we assume that Dr Jarlow\u0027s analysis is correct and see where that takes us? If there is oxygen in the atmosphere of this world, might we not assume that it\u0027s been terraformed?\u0027 All eyes turned to look at him. \u0027Terraformed?\u0027 said Jarlow blankly. \u0027Yes, terraformed. Why not? You have this world that is suitable for life, except that it has the carbon dioxide and nitrogen atmosphere that worlds without life have - like Mars and Venus - and you dump algae into the ocean and pretty soon it\u0027s \"Goodbye, carbon dioxide,\" and \"Hello, oxygen.\" Or maybe you do something else. I\u0027m no expert.\u0027 They were still looking at him. Fisher went on. \u0027The reason I\u0027m suggesting this is that I remember there was talk about terraforming on the farms on Rotor. I worked there. There were even some seminars on terraforming that I attended because I felt it might have something to do with the hyper-assistance program. It didn\u0027t, but at least I heard about terraforming.\u0027 Finally Jarlow said, \u0027In all you heard about terraforming, Fisher, do you by any chance recall anyone saying how long it would take?\u0027 Fisher spread his arms. \u0027You tell me, Dr Jarlow. It will save time, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 \u0027All right. It took Rotor two years to get here - if it got here. That means it\u0027s been here thirteen years. If all of Rotor were solid algae and it was all dumped into the ocean and lived and grew and produced oxygen, then to get to the present level, where I estimate the oxygen content is 18 per cent and carbon dioxide is present only in traces, I would imagine it would take some thousands of years. Perhaps hundreds of years - if conditions were enormously favorable. It certainly would take more than thirteen years. And, frankly, Earth algae are adapted to Earth conditions quite precisely. On another world, the algae might not grow, or might do so very slowly, till it adapted itself. Thirteen years wouldn\u0027t change a thing.\u0027 Fisher seemed unperturbed. \u0027Ah, but there is lots of oxygen there and no carbon dioxide, so if it\u0027s not the result of Rotorian action, what is it the result of? Doesn\u0027t it strike you that we must assume there\u0027s non-Earthly life on this world?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s what I did assume,\u0027 said Jarlow. Wendel said, \u0027It\u0027s what we have to assume immediately. Native vegetation is photosynthesizing. It doesn\u0027t mean, for one moment, that Rotorians are on the world, or that they ever even reached this system.\u0027 Fisher looked annoyed. \u0027Well, Captain,\u0027 he said with pointed formality, \u0027I have to say that neither does it mean that Rotorians aren\u0027t on the world, or that they haven\u0027t reach the system. If the planet has vegetation of its own, it just means that no terraforming was required and the Rotorians could move right in.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Blankowitz. \u0027I should think there would be no reasonable chance at all that vegetation evolving on a strange planet would be nourishing to human beings. I doubt that human beings could digest it, or that they could assimilate even if they could digest it. I would certainly offer high odds that it would be poisonous. And if there\u0027s plant life, there\u0027s bound to be animal life, and we don\u0027t know what that would entail.\u0027 \u0027Even in that case,\u0027 said Fisher, \u0027it\u0027s still possible that the Rotorians would fence off a tract of land, kill the native life within it, and seed plants of their own. I imagine this alien planting - if you want to call it that - would expand with the years.\u0027 \u0027Supposition on supposition,\u0027 muttered Wendel. \u0027In any case,\u0027 said Fisher, \u0027it\u0027s completely useless to sit here and make up scenarios, when the logical thing is to explore the world as best we can - and from as close a view as possible. Even from its surface - if that seems feasible.\u0027 And Wu said with surprising force, \u0027I completely agree.\u0027 Blankowitz said, \u0027I\u0027m a biophysicist, and if there\u0027s life on the planet, then whatever else it may have or may not have, we must explore it.\u0027 Wendel looked from one to the other and, reddening slightly, said, \u0027I suppose we must.\u0027 84 \u0027The closer we get,\u0027 said Tessa Wendel, \u0027and the more information we gather, the more confusing it all is. Is there any question that this is apparently a dead world? There is no illumination on the night hemisphere; there are no signs of vegetation or of any form of life.\u0027 \u0027No gross signs,\u0027 said Wu coolly, \u0027but something must be happening to keep oxygen in the air. Not being a chemist, I can\u0027t think of any chemical process that would do the trick. Can anyone?\u0027 He scarcely waited for an answer. \u0027In fact,\u0027 he went on, \u0027I seriously question whether a chemist could come up with a chemical explanation. If the oxygen is there, it must be a biological process that produces it. We just don\u0027t know of anything else.\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027If we say that, then we\u0027re judging from our experience with exactly one oxygen-containing atmosphere - Earth\u0027s. Someday we may be laughed at. It may turn out that the Galaxy is littered with oxygen atmospheres that have no connection with life, and we\u0027ll be on record as having been stymied entirely because of our experience with the one planet that is a freak and has a biological source of the oxygen.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Jarlow angrily. \u0027You can\u0027t get out of it that way, Captain. You can picture all sorts of scenarios, but you can\u0027t expect the laws of nature to change for your convenience. If you want to have a nonbiological source of an oxygen-containing atmosphere, you have to suggest a mechanism.\u0027 \u0027But,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027there\u0027s no sign of chlorophyll in the light reflected from the world.\u0027 \u0027Why should there be?\u0027 said Jarlow. \u0027The chances are that a somewhat different molecule has been evolved under the selective pressure of light from a red dwarf star. May I make a suggestion?\u0027 \u0027Please do,\u0027 said Wendel bitterly. \u0027It seems to me you do nothing else.\u0027 \u0027Very well. All we can actually tell is that the land areas of the world seem to be completely denuded of life. That means nothing. Until four hundred million years ago, Earth\u0027s land areas were similarly sterile, but the planet had an oxygen atmosphere and abundant life.\u0027 \u0027Sea life.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Captain. There\u0027s nothing wrong with sea life. And that would include algae or the equivalent - microscopic plants that would do perfectly well as oxygen factories. The algae in Earth\u0027s seas produce 80 per cent of the oxygen that pours into the atmosphere each year. Doesn\u0027t this explain everything? It explains the oxygen atmosphere and it also explains the apparent lack of land life. It also means we can safely explore the planet by landing on the sterile land surface of the world and studying the sea with what instruments we have - leaving it for a later expedition, suitably equipped, to do the detailed work.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but human beings are land animals. If Rotor had reached this system, they would surely have attempted to colonize the land areas and of such colonization there is no hint. Is it really necessary to investigate the world further?\u0027 the Captain asked. \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Wu quickly. \u0027We can\u0027t go back with deductions only. We need some facts. There may be surprises.\u0027 \u0027Do you expect any?\u0027 asked Wendel with a touch of anger. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter whether I do or not. Can we go back to Earth and tell them that - without looking - we were sure there would be no surprises? That would not be very sensible.\u0027 \u0027It seems to me,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027that you\u0027ve changed your mind rather drastically. You were ready to return without even approaching the Neighbor Star.\u0027 \u0027As I recall,\u0027 said Wu, \u0027I had my mind changed for me. In any case, under the circumstances, we must explore. I know, Captain, that there is a certain temptation to seize the opportunity to visit a few other star systems, but now that there is an apparently habitable world in view, we must come back to Earth with maximum information on something that may be far more important to our planet in a very practical sense than any amount of catalogue-type information concerning the nearer stars. Besides\u0027 - and he pointed at the viewport with what was almost surprise on his face - \u0027I want to take a closer look at that world. I have this feeling it will be completely safe.\u0027 \u0027This feeling?\u0027 said Wendel sardonically. \u0027I\u0027m allowed my intuitions, Captain.\u0027 Merry Blankowitz said in a rather husky voice, \u0027I have my intuitions, too, Captain, and I\u0027m worried.\u0027 Wendel looked at the young woman with sudden surprise. She said, \u0027Are you weeping, Blankowitz?\u0027 \u0027No, not really, Captain. I\u0027m just very upset.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve been using the ND.\u0027 \u0027The neuronic detector? On that empty world? Why?\u0027 Blankowitz said, \u0027Because I came here to use it. Because that\u0027s my function.\u0027 \u0027And the results are negative,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Blankowitz, but if we visit other star systems, you\u0027ll have other chances.\u0027 \u0027But that\u0027s just it, Captain. The results are not negative. I detect intelligence on the world and that\u0027s why I\u0027m upset. It\u0027s a ridiculous result, and I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong.\u0027 Jarlow said, \u0027Perhaps the device isn\u0027t working. It\u0027s so new that it wouldn\u0027t be surprising if it weren\u0027t reliable.\u0027 \u0027But why isn\u0027t it working? Is the neuronic detector detecting us here on the ship? Or is it simply giving a false positive? I\u0027ve checked it. The shielding is in perfect order, and if I had a false positive, I ought to have it elsewhere. There are no signs of any positive responses from the gas giant, for instance, or from the Neighbor Star, or from random points in space, but every time I allow it to sweep the satellite, I get a response.\u0027 \u0027You mean,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027that on this world, where we can detect no life, you detect intelligence?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a very minimal response. I can just barely pick it up.\u0027 Crile Fisher said, \u0027Actually, Captain, what about Jarlow\u0027s point? If there\u0027s life in the world\u0027s ocean and we don\u0027t detect it because the water\u0027s opaque, there might still be intelligent life, and perhaps Dr Blankowitz detects that.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Fisher has a good point. After all, life in the sea - however intelligent - is not likely to have a technology. You can\u0027t have fire in the sea. Nontechnological life does not make itself very evident, but it may still be intelligent. And a species, however intelligent, is not to be feared without technology, especially if it can\u0027t leave the sea, and if we remain on land. It just makes things more interesting and makes it more necessary for us to investigate.\u0027 Blankowitz said in annoyance, \u0027You all talk so quickly and so endlessly that I don\u0027t get a chance to say anything. You\u0027re all wrong. If it were intelligent sea life, I would get a positive response only from the oceans. I get it everywhere, just about evenly. Land as well as sea. I don\u0027t understand it at all.\u0027 \u0027On land as well?\u0027 said Wendel, clearly incredulous. \u0027Then there must be something wrong.\u0027 \u0027But I can\u0027t find anything wrong,\u0027 said Blankowitz. \u0027That\u0027s what\u0027s so upsetting. I just don\u0027t understand this.\u0027 Then, as though in extenuation, she added, \u0027It\u0027s very feeble, of course, but it\u0027s there.\u0027 Fisher said, \u0027I think I can explain it.\u0027 All eyes turned to him, and he grew immediately defensive. \u0027Maybe I\u0027m not a scientist,\u0027 he said, \u0027but that doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t see something that\u0027s pretty plain. There\u0027s intelligence in the sea, but we can\u0027t see it because the water hides it. All right, that makes sense. But there\u0027s intelligence on land, too. Well, that\u0027s hidden also. It\u0027s underground.\u0027 \u0027Underground?\u0027 said Jarlow explosively. \u0027Why should it be underground? There\u0027s nothing wrong with the air or with the temperature or with anything we can detect. What\u0027s here to hide from?\u0027 \u0027From the light, for one thing,\u0027 said Fisher forcefully. \u0027I\u0027m talking about the Rotorians. Suppose they did colonize the planet. Why would they want to remain under the red light of the Neighbor Star, light in which their Rotorian plant life would not flourish, and under which they themselves would grow despondent? Underground, they could have artificial lighting and both they and their plants would be better off. Besides-\u0027 He paused and Wendel said, \u0027Go on. What else?\u0027 \u0027Well, you have to understand the Rotorians. They live on the inside of a world. It\u0027s what they\u0027re used to and what they consider normal. They wouldn\u0027t find it comfortable to cling to the outside skin of a world. They would dig underneath, as a matter of course.\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027Then you\u0027re suggesting that Blankowitz\u0027s neuronic detector is detecting the presence of human beings under the surface of the planet.\u0027 \u0027Yes. Why not? It\u0027s the thickness of the soil between their caverns and the surface that weakens the response the neuronic detector is measuring.\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027But Blankowitz gets more or less the same response over both land and sea.\u0027 \u0027Over the entire planet. It\u0027s very even,\u0027 said Blankowitz. \u0027All right,\u0027 said Fisher. \u0027Native intelligence in the sea, Rotorians underground on land. Why not?\u0027 \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Jarlow. \u0027You get a response everywhere, Blankowitz. Right?\u0027 \u0027Everywhere. I\u0027ve detected some slight ups and downs, but the response is so shallow I can\u0027t really be sure. Certainly, there seems to be some intelligence everywhere on the planet.\u0027 Jarlow said, \u0027I suppose that\u0027s possible in the sea, but how is it possible on land? Do you suppose that Rotorians, in thirteen years, in thirteen years, have dug a network of tunnels under all the land surface of this world. If you got one area of response, or even two - small ones, taking up a tiny fraction of the world\u0027s surface - I\u0027d consider the possibility of Rotorian burrowing. But the entire surface? Please! Tell that to my aunt Tillie.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Am I to take it, Henry, that you are suggesting that there is an alien intelligence underground everywhere on the land surface?\u0027 Jarlow said, \u0027I don\u0027t see what other conclusion we can come to unless we want to conclude that Blankowitz\u0027s device is completely meaningless.\u0027 \u0027In that case,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027I wonder if it\u0027s safe to go down and investigate. An alien intelligence is not necessarily a friendly intelligence, and the Superluminal is not equipped to make war.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027I don\u0027t think we can give up. We must find out what kind of intelligent life is present, and how it might interfere - if at all - with any plans we may make to evacuate Earth and come here.\u0027 Blankowitz said, \u0027There is one place where the response is a tiny bit more intense than it is everywhere else. Not much. Shall I try to find it again?\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027Go ahead. Try. We can examine the surroundings there carefully and then decide whether to descender not.\u0027 Wu smiled blandly. \u0027I\u0027m sure it will be entirely safe to do so.\u0027 Wendel merely scowled unhappily. 85 The peculiar thing about Saltade Leverett (in the opinion of Janus Pitt) was that he liked it out in the asteroid belt. Apparently, there were some people who truly enjoyed emptiness, who loved inanimacy. \u0027I don\u0027t dislike people,\u0027 Leverett would explain. \u0027I can get all I want of them on holovision - talk to them, listen to them, laugh with them. I can do everything but feel them and smell them, and who wants to do that? Besides we\u0027re building five Settlements in the asteroid belt and I can visit any one of them and get my fill of people and smell them, too, for what good that does me.\u0027 And then, when he did come to Rotor - the \u0027metropolis\u0027, as he insisted on calling it - he would keep looking from one side to the other as though he expected people to crowd in on him. He even looked at chairs suspiciously, and sat down on them with a sidewise slide as though hoping to wipe off the aura that the previous backside had left upon it. Janus Pitt had always thought he was the ideal Acting Commissioner for the Asteroid Project. That position had, in effect, given him a free hand in everything that had to do with the outer rim of the Nemesian System. That included not only the Settlements in progress, but with the Scanning Service itself. They had finished their lunch in the privacy of Pitt\u0027s quarters, for Saltade would sooner go hungry than eat in a dining room to which the general public (meaning even a third person who was unknown to him) would be admitted. Pitt, in fact, felt a certain surprise that Leverett had agreed to eat with him. Pitt studied him casually. Leverett was so lean and leathery, and gave such an appearance of whipcord and gristle that he didn\u0027t look as if he had ever been young or would ever be old. His eyes were faded blue, his hair faded yellow. Pitt said, \u0027When was the last time you were on Rotor, Saltade?\u0027 \u0027Nearly two years ago, and I take it unkindly of you to put me through this, Janus.\u0027 \u0027Why, what have I done? I certainly haven\u0027t summoned you here, though since you are here, old friend, you\u0027re welcome.\u0027 \u0027You might as well have summoned me. What\u0027s this message you sent out to the effect that you were not to be bothered with little things. Are you getting to the point where you\u0027re so big you want only big things?\u0027 Pitt\u0027s smile grew a trifle strained. \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Saltade.\u0027 \u0027They had a report for you. They detected a small bit of radiation coming in from outside. They sent it to you and you sent back one of your special memos about how you couldn\u0027t be bothered.\u0027 \u0027Oh, that!\u0027 (Pitt remembered. It had been that moment of self-pity and irritation. Surely he was allowed to be irritated at times.) \u0027Well, your people are watching for Settlements. They shouldn\u0027t bother me with minor matters.\u0027 \u0027If that\u0027s your attitude, fine. But it so happens they\u0027ve found something that\u0027s not a Settlement and they don\u0027t want to report it to you. They\u0027ve reported it to me, and they\u0027ve requested me to pass it on to you despite your order that you are not to be bothered with minutiae. They figure it\u0027s my job to handle you, but I\u0027d rather not, Janus. Are you becoming a cantankerous fellow in your powerful old age?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t rattle on, Saltade. What is it they\u0027ve reported?\u0027 said Pitt, with more than a touch of cantankerousness about him. \u0027They spotted a vessel.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean - a vessel? Not a Settlement?\u0027 Leverett held up a gnarled paw. \u0027Not a Settlement. I said a vessel.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s to understand? Do you need a computer? If so, yours is right there. A vessel is a ship making its way through space, with a crew on board.\u0027 \u0027How large?\u0027 \u0027It could carry half a dozen people, I suppose.\u0027 \u0027Then it must be one of ours.\u0027 \u0027It isn\u0027t. Every one of ours is accounted for. This one is simply not of Rotorian manufacture. The Scanning Service may have been reluctant to talk to you about it, but they did some work on their own. No computer anywhere in the system has been involved with the construction of any ship like that vessel, and no-one could have built a vessel like that without computer involvement at some stage.\u0027 \u0027Then you conclude?\u0027 \u0027That it\u0027s not a Rotorian vessel. It comes from elsewhere. As long as there was the slightest chance that it might have been produced by us, my boys kept quiet and didn\u0027t disturb you, per your instructions. When it appeared, definitely, not to be one of our own, they passed it on to me and said you should be told, but that they wouldn\u0027t do it. You know, Janus, past a certain point, trampling on people is counter-productive.\u0027 \u0027Shut up,\u0027 said Pitt peevishly. \u0027How could it be non-Rotorian? Where would it come from?\u0027 \u0027I suppose it had to come from the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027Impossible! A vessel of the size you describe, with half a dozen people onboard couldn\u0027t possibly have made the trip from the Solar System. Even if they discovered hyper-assistance, and it is certainly conceivable they did, a half-dozen people at close quarters for over two years could not complete the trip alive. Maybe there are some exemplary crews, well-trained and unusually suited to the task, who could make the trip and end up at least partly sane, but nobody in the Solar System would risk it. Nothing less than a complete Settlement, a self-contained world occupied by people accustomed to it from birth, could possibly make an interstellar trip and do well.\u0027 \u0027Nevertheless,\u0027 said Leverett, \u0027we have here a small vessel of non-Rotorian manufacture. That\u0027s a fact, and you have no choice but to accept that, I promise you. Where do you say it came from? The nearest star is the Sun; that\u0027s a fact, too. If it didn\u0027t come from the Solar System, then it came from some other star system and the journey was a good deal longer than two years and a bit. If two years and a bit is impossible, everything else is certainly impossible.\u0027 Pitt said, \u0027Suppose it\u0027s not human at all. Suppose these are other forms of life, with other psychologies, that can endure long trips at close quarters.\u0027 \u0027Or suppose they are people this big\u0027 - and Leverett held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch apart - \u0027and that the vessel is a Settlement for them. Well - it\u0027s not so. They\u0027re not aliens. They\u0027re not teeny-weenies. That vessel isn\u0027t Rotorian, but it is human. We\u0027d expect aliens to look completely different from human beings, and they ought to build ships completely different from those of human beings. That vessel is a human vessel right down to the serial code along its side, which is in the terrestrial alphabet.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t say that!\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t think it needed saying.\u0027 Pitt said, \u0027It could be a human ship, but it could be automated. It could have robots onboard.\u0027 \u0027It could,\u0027 said Leverett. \u0027In that case, should we blow it out of the sky? If there are no human beings onboard, there are no ethical problems involved. You destroy property but, after all, they\u0027re trespassing.\u0027 Pitt said, \u0027I\u0027m considering it.\u0027 Leverett smiled broadly. \u0027Don\u0027t! That vessel has not spent more than two years traveling through space.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027Have you forgotten the condition Rotor was in when we arrived here? We did spend over two years in passage, and half of that time we were in normal space going at just under the speed of light. At that speed, the surface was abraded by collision with atoms, molecules and dust particles. It took polishing and repairs, as I recall. Don\u0027t you remember?\u0027 \u0027And this ship?\u0027 said Pitt, without bothering to say whether he remembered. \u0027As shiny as though it had traveled no more than a few million kilometers at ordinary speeds.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s impossible. Don\u0027t bother me with these games.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not impossible. A few million kilometers at ordinary speeds is all they passed through. The rest of the way - hyperspace.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 Pitt\u0027s patience was wearing thin. \u0027Superluminal flight. They\u0027ve got it.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s theoretically impossible.\u0027 \u0027Is it? Well, if you can think of any other way of explaining all this, go to it.\u0027 Pitt stared at him, open-mouthed. \u0027But-\u0027 \u0027I know. The physicists say it\u0027s impossible, but they have it, anyway. Now let me tell you this. If they have superluminal flight, they must have superluminal communication. Then the Solar System knows they\u0027re here and it knows what\u0027s happening. If we blow the ship out of the sky, the Solar System will know that, too, and, after a while, a fleet of such vessels will come out of space, and they\u0027ll come shooting at us.\u0027 \u0027What would you do, then?\u0027 Pitt found himself temporarily unable to think. \u0027What else is there to do but to greet them in friendly fashion, find out what they are, who they are, what they\u0027re doing, and what they want? Now it\u0027s my idea that they plan to land on Erythro. We\u0027ll have to land there, too, and talk to them.\u0027 \u0027On Erythro?\u0027 \u0027If they\u0027re on Erythro, Janus, where do you want us to be? We\u0027ve got to confront them there. We\u0027ve got to take that chance.\u0027 Pitt felt his mind beginning to tick over again. He said, \u0027Since this seems to you to be necessary, would you be willing to do it? With a ship and a crew, of course.\u0027 \u0027You mean you won\u0027t?\u0027 \u0027As Commissioner? I can\u0027t come down to greet some unknown ship.\u0027 \u0027Beneath the official dignity. I see. So I\u0027m to face the aliens, or the teeny-weenies, or the robots, or whatever, without you.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll be in constant contact, of course, Saltade. Voice and image.\u0027 \u0027At a distance.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but a successful mission on your part would be suitably rewarded, after all.\u0027 \u0027Is that so? In that case-\u0027 Leverett looked at Pitt, speculatively. Pitt waited, then said, \u0027Are you going to name a price?\u0027 \u0027I am going to suggest a price. If you want me to meet this vessel on Erythro, then I want Erythro.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027I want Erythro as my home. I\u0027m tired of the asteroids. I\u0027m tired of scanning. I\u0027m tired of people. I\u0027ve had enough. I want a whole empty world. I want to build nice living quarters, get food and necessaries from the Dome, have my own farm and my own animals if I can coax them to do well.\u0027 \u0027How long have you wanted this?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s been growing on me. And since I came here and have gotten a good look at Rotor with its crowds and noise, Erythro looks better than ever to me.\u0027 Pitt frowned. \u0027That makes two of you. You\u0027re just like that mad girl.\u0027 \u0027What mad girl?\u0027 \u0027Eugenia Insigna\u0027s daughter. You know Insigna, I suppose.\u0027 \u0027The astronomer? Of course. I haven\u0027t met her daughter.\u0027 \u0027Completely mad. She wants to stay on Erythro.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t consider that mad. I consider that very sensible. In fact, if she wants to say on Erythro, I could endure a woman-\u0027 Pitt held up a finger. \u0027I said \"girl\".\u0027 \u0027How old is she?\u0027 \u0027Fifteen.\u0027 \u0027Oh? Well, she\u0027ll get older. Unfortunately, so will I.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not one of your raving beauties.\u0027 \u0027If you\u0027ll take a good look, Janus,\u0027 said Leverett, \u0027neither am I. You have my terms.\u0027 \u0027You want it officially recorded in the computer?\u0027 \u0027Just as a formality, eh, Janus?\u0027 Pitt did not smile. \u0027Very well. We\u0027ll try to watch where that vessel lands, and we\u0027ll make you ready for Erythro.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-36.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
