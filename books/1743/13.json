{"id":70494,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"20 As it happened, Crile Fisher, having given Earth its first hint that there was something peculiar about Rotor\u0027s destination, gave it its second hint as well. He had been back on Earth two years now, with Rotor growing dimmer in his mind. Eugenia Insigna was a rather perplexing memory (what had he felt for her?), but Marlene remained a bitterness. He found he could not separate her from Roseanne in his mind. The one-year-old daughter he remembered and the seventeen-year-old sister he also remembered fused into one personality. Life was not hard. He drew a generous pension. They had even found work for him to do, an easy administrative position in which he was required to make decisions on occasion that were guaranteed to affect nothing of importance. They had forgiven him, at least in part, he thought, because he had remembered that one remark of Eugenia\u0027s, \u0027If you knew where we were going-\u0027 Yet he had the impression that he was kept under watch, anyway, and he had grown to resent it. Garand Wyler appeared now and then, always friendly, always inquisitive, always returning the subject to Rotor in one way or another. He had, in fact, made his appearance now, and the subject of Rotor came up, as Fisher expected it would. Fisher scowled, and said, \u0027It\u0027s been nearly two years. What do you people want of me?\u0027 Wyler shook his head. \u0027I can\u0027t say I know, Crile. All we have is that remark of your wife\u0027s. It\u0027s obviously not enough. She must have said something else in the years you spent with her. Consider the conversations you have had; the talk that bounced back and forth between the two of you. Is there nothing there?\u0027 \u0027This is the fifth time you\u0027ve asked that, Garand. I have been questioned. I have been hypnotized. I have been mind-probed. I have been squeezed dry, and there is nothing in me. Let me go and find something else to tackle. Or put me back to work. There are a hundred Settlements out there, with friends confiding in each other and enemies spying on each other. Who knows what one of them may know - and may not even know that he knows.\u0027 Wyler said, \u0027To be truthful, old man, we\u0027ve been moving in that direction, and we\u0027ve also been concentrating on the Far Probe. It stands to reason that Rotor must have found something the rest of us don\u0027t know. We\u0027ve never sent out a Far Probe. Neither has any other Settlement. Only Rotor had the capacity for it. Whatever Rotor found must be in the Far Probe data.\u0027 \u0027Good. Look through that data. There must be enough there to keep you busy for years. As for me, leave me alone. All of you.\u0027 Wyler said, \u0027As a matter of fact, there is enough there to keep us busy for years. Rotor supplied a great deal of data in line with the Open Science Agreement. In particular, we have their stellar photography at every range of wavelength. The Far Probe cameras were able to reach almost every part of the sky, and we\u0027ve been studying it in detail and have found nothing in it of interest.\u0027 \u0027Nothing?\u0027 \u0027So far, nothing, but, as you say, we can continue to study it for years. Of course, we already have any number of items the astronomy people are delighted with. It keeps them happy and busy, but not a single item, not the sniff of one seems to help us decide where they went. Not so far. I gather that there is absolutely nothing, for instance, to lead us to think that there are planets orbiting either large star of the Alpha Centauri system. Nor are there any unexpected Sun-like stars we don\u0027t know about in our neighborhood. Personally, I wouldn\u0027t expect to find much anyway. What could the Far Probe see that we couldn\u0027t see from the Solar System? It was only a couple of light-months away. It should make no difference. Yet some of us feel that Rotor must have seen something and rather quickly, too. Which brings us back to you.\u0027 \u0027Why me?\u0027 \u0027Because your ex-wife was the head of the Far Probe project.\u0027 \u0027Not really. She became Chief Astronomer after the data had been collected.\u0027 \u0027She was the head afterward and certainly an important part during. Did she never say anything to you about what they had found in the Far Probe?\u0027 \u0027Not a word. Wait, did you say that the Far Probe cameras were able to reach almost every part of the sky?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027How much is \"almost every part\"? \u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not in their confidence to the point where I can give you exact figures. I gather it\u0027s at least 90 per cent.\u0027 \u0027Or more?\u0027 \u0027Maybe more.\u0027 \u0027I wonder-\u0027 \u0027What do you wonder?\u0027 \u0027On Rotor, we had a fellow named Pitt running things.\u0027 \u0027We know that.\u0027 \u0027But I think I know how he would do things. He would hand out the Far Probe data a little at a time, living up to the Open Science Agreement, but just barely. And somehow, by the time Rotor left, there would have been some of the data - 10 per cent or less - that he would not have had time to get to you. And that would be the important 10 per cent or less.\u0027 \u0027You mean the part that tells us where Rotor went.\u0027 \u0027Maybe.\u0027 \u0027Only we haven\u0027t got it.\u0027 \u0027Sure, you have it.\u0027 \u0027How do you make that out?\u0027 \u0027Just a little while ago you wondered why you should expect to see anything in the Far Probe photographs that you couldn\u0027t see in the Solar System records. So why are you wasting your time on what they gave you? Map out the part of the sky they didn\u0027t give you and study that part on your own maps. Ask yourself if there\u0027s anything there that might look different on a Far Probe map - and why. That\u0027s what I would do.\u0027 His voice suddenly rose to a formidable shout. \u0027You go back there. Tell them to look at the part of the sky they don\u0027t have.\u0027 Wyler said thoughtfully, \u0027Topsy-turvy.\u0027 \u0027No, it isn\u0027t. Perfectly straightforward. Just find someone in the Office who does more with his brain than sit on it, and you may get somewhere.\u0027 Wyler said, \u0027We\u0027ll see.\u0027 He held out his hand to Fisher. Fisher scowled and wouldn\u0027t take it. It was months before Wyler made an appearance again, and Fisher didn\u0027t welcome him. He had been in a quiet mood on this off-day from work, and had even been reading a book. Fisher was not one of those people who felt that a book was a twentieth-century abomination, that only viewing was civilized. There was something, he thought, about holding a book, about the physical turning of pages, about the ability to lose one\u0027s self in thought over what one has read, or even to drowse off, without coming to, and finding the film a hundred pages beyond, or flickering at its close. Fisher was rather of the opinion that the book was the more civilized of the two modes. He was all the more annoyed at being roused out of his pleasant lethargy. \u0027Now, what, Garand?\u0027 he said ungraciously. Wyler did not lose his urbane smile. He said, between his teeth, \u0027We\u0027ve found it, just exactly as you said we would.\u0027 \u0027Found what?\u0027 said Fisher, not remembering. Then, realizing what this must refer to, he said hastily, \u0027Don\u0027t tell me anything I\u0027m not supposed to know. I won\u0027t be tangled with the Office any more.\u0027 \u0027Too late, Crile. You\u0027re wanted. Tanayama himself wants you in front of him.\u0027 \u0027When?\u0027 \u0027As soon as I can get you there.\u0027 \u0027In that case, tell me what\u0027s going on. I don\u0027t want to face him cold.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what I intend to do. We studied every portion of the sky that the Far Probe did not report on. Apparently those who did so asked themselves, as you advised, what it was that a Far Probe camera could see that a Solar System camera could not. The obvious answer was a displacement of the nearer stars, and once that was in their heads, the astronomers found an astonishing thing, something they couldn\u0027t have predicted.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027They found a very dim star with a parallax of well over one second of arc.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not an astronomer. Is that unusual?\u0027 \u0027It means that the star is at only half the distance of Alpha Centauri.\u0027 \u0027You said \"very dim\".\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s behind a small dust cloud, they tell me. Listen, if you\u0027re not an astronomer, your wife on Rotor was. Perhaps she discovered it. Did she ever say anything to you about it?\u0027 Fisher shook his head. \u0027Not a word. Of course-\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027In the last few months, there was an excitement about her. A kind of brimming over.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t ask why?\u0027 \u0027I assumed it was the imminent departure of Rotor. She was excited about going and that drove me mad.\u0027 \u0027On account of your daughter?\u0027 Fisher nodded. \u0027The excitement may have been over the new star, too. It all fits. Naturally, they\u0027d go to this new star. And if your wife had discovered it, they would be going to her star. That would account for some of her eagerness to go. Doesn\u0027t it make sense?\u0027 \u0027Maybe. I can\u0027t say it doesn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027All right, then. That\u0027s what Tanayama wants to see you about. And he\u0027s angry. Not at you, apparently, but he\u0027s angry.\u0027 21 It was later that same day, for there was no delay on this occasion, that Crile Fisher found himself in the office of the Terrestrial Board of Inquiry, or, as it was far better known to its employees, simply the Office. Kattimoro Tanayama, who had directed the Office for over thirty years, was getting quite elderly. The holographs shown of him (there weren\u0027t many) had been recorded years before, when his hair was still smooth and black, his body straight, his expression vigorous. Now his hair was gray, his body (never tall) was slightly bent, and possessed an air of frailty. He might, thought Fisher, be reaching the point where he was considering retiring, if it were conceivable that he intended to do anything but die in harness. His eyes, Fisher noted, were, between their narrowed lids, as keen and as sharp as ever. Fisher had a little trouble understanding him. English was as nearly universal a language on Earth as it was possible for a language to be, but it had its varieties, and Tanayama\u0027s was not the North American variety Fisher was accustomed to. Tanayama said coldly, \u0027Well, Fisher, you failed us on Rotor.\u0027 Fisher saw no point in arguing the matter; and no point in arguing with Tanayama, in any case. \u0027Yes, Director,\u0027 he said tonelessly. \u0027Yet you may still have information for us.\u0027 Fisher sighed silently, then said, \u0027I have been debriefed over and over.\u0027 \u0027So I have been told, and so I know. You have not been asked everything, however, and I have a question to which I - I - want an answer.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Director?\u0027 \u0027In your stay on Rotor, have you been aware of anything that would lead you to believe that the Rotorian leadership hated Earth?\u0027 Fisher\u0027s eyebrows climbed. \u0027Hate? It was clear to me that the people on Rotor, as on all Settlements, I think, looked down on Earth, despised it as decadent, brutal and violent. But hatred? I don\u0027t think they thought enough of us, frankly, to feel hatred.\u0027 \u0027I talk of the leadership, not of the multitude.\u0027 \u0027So do I, Director. No hatred.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no other way of accounting for it.\u0027 \u0027Accounting for what, Director? If that is a question I may ask?\u0027 Tanayama looked up at him sharply (the force of his personality made one rarely aware of just how short he was). \u0027Do you know that this new star is moving in our direction? Quite in our direction?\u0027 Fisher, startled, looked quickly toward Wyler, but Wyler sat in comparative shadow, well out of range of the sunlight from the window, and was not, in appearance, looking at anything. Tanayama, who was standing, said, \u0027Well, sit down, Fisher, if it will help you think. I will sit down, too.\u0027 He sat down on the edge of his desk, his short legs dangling. \u0027Did you know about the motion of the star?\u0027 \u0027No, Director. I didn\u0027t know of the existence of the star at all till Agent Wyler told me.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t? Surely it was known on Rotor.\u0027 \u0027If so, no-one told me.\u0027 \u0027Your wife was excited and happy in the last period before Rotor left. So you told Agent Wyler. What was the reason?\u0027 \u0027Agent Wyler had thought it might be because she had discovered the star.\u0027 \u0027And perhaps she knew of the star\u0027s motion and was pleased at the thought of what would happen to us.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t see why that thought should make her happy, Director. I must tell you that I do not actually know that she knew of the star\u0027s motion or even that it existed. I do not, of my own knowledge, know that anyone on Rotor knew that the star existed.\u0027 Tanayama looked at him thoughtfully, rubbing one side of his chin lightly, as though relieving a slight itch. He said, \u0027The people on Rotor were all Euros, I believe, weren\u0027t they?\u0027 Fisher\u0027s eyes widened. He hadn\u0027t heard that vulgarism in a long time - never from a government functionary. He remembered Wyler\u0027s comment soon after he had returned to Earth about Rotor being \u0027Snow White\u0027. He had dismissed it as a piece of lighthearted sarcasm, and had given no heed to it. He said resentfully, \u0027I don\u0027t know, Director. I didn\u0027t study them all. I don\u0027t know what their ancestries may be.\u0027 \u0027Come, Fisher. You don\u0027t have to study them. Judge by their appearances. In all your stay on Rotor, did you encounter one face that was Afro, or Mongo, or Hindo? Did you encounter a dark complexion? An epicanthic fold?\u0027 Fisher exploded. \u0027Director, you\u0027re being twentieth-century.\u0027 (If he had known a stronger way of putting it, he would have.) \u0027I don\u0027t give these things thought, and no-one on Earth should. I\u0027m surprised you do, and I don\u0027t think it would help your position if it were known that you do.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t indulge in fairy tales, Agent Fisher,\u0027 said the Director, moving one gnarled finger from side to side in admonition. \u0027I am talking about what is. I know that on Earth we ignore all variation among ourselves, at least outwardly.\u0027 \u0027Just outwardly?\u0027 said Fisher in indignation. \u0027Just outwardly,\u0027 said Tanayama coldly. \u0027When Earth\u0027s people go out to the Settlements, they sort themselves out by variation. Why should they do that, if they ignored all variation? On any Settlement, all are alike, or, if there is some admixture to begin with, those who are well outnumbered feel ill-at-ease, or are made to feel ill-at-ease, and shift to another Settlement where they are not outnumbered. Isn\u0027t that so?\u0027 Fisher found he could not deny this. It was so, and he had somehow taken it for granted without questioning it. He said, \u0027Human nature. Like clings to like. It set up a - neighborhood.\u0027 \u0027Human nature, of course. Like clings to like, because like hates and despises unlike.\u0027 \u0027There are M - Mongo Settlements, too.\u0027 Fisher stumbled over the word, and realized full well that he might be mortally offending the Director - an easy and dangerous man to offend. Tanayama did not blink. \u0027I know that well, but it\u0027s the Euros who most recently dominated the planet, and they cannot forget it, can they?\u0027 \u0027The others, perhaps, cannot forget that either, and they have more cause to hate.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s Rotor that went flying off to escape from the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027It happened to be they who had discovered hyper-assistance.\u0027 \u0027And they went to a nearby star that only they knew of, one which is heading toward our Solar System and may pass closely enough to disrupt it.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t know they know that, or that they even know the star.\u0027 \u0027Of course they know it,\u0027 said Tanayama with what was almost a snarl. \u0027And they left without warning us.\u0027 \u0027Director - with respect - this is illogical. If they are going to establish themselves on a star that will, on its approach, disrupt our Solar System, the star\u0027s own system will also be disrupted.\u0027 \u0027They can easily escape, even if they build more Settlements. We have an entire world of eight billion people to evacuate - a much more difficult task.\u0027 \u0027How much time do we have?\u0027 Tanayama shrugged. \u0027Several thousand years, they tell me.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a great deal of time. It might not have occurred to them, just conceivably, that it was necessary to warn us. As the star approaches, it will surely be discovered without warning.\u0027 \u0027And by that time, we will have less time to evacuate. Their discovery of the star was accidental. We should not have discovered it for a long time, but for your wife\u0027s indiscreet remark to you, and but for your suggestion - a good one - that we look closely at the part of the sky that had been omitted. Rotor was counting on our discovery being as belated as possible.\u0027 \u0027But, Director, why should they want such a thing? Sheer motiveless hate?\u0027 \u0027Not motiveless. So that the Solar System, with its heavy load of non-Euros, might be destroyed. So that humanity can make a new start on a homogeneous basis of Euros only. Eh? What do you think of that?\u0027 Fisher shook his head helplessly. \u0027Impossible. Unthinkable.\u0027 \u0027Why else should they have failed to warn us?\u0027 \u0027Might it not be that they did not themselves know of the star\u0027s motion?\u0027 \u0027Impossible,\u0027 said Tanayama ironically. \u0027Unthinkable. There is no other reason for what they have done but their willingness to see us destroyed. But we will discover hyperspatial travel for ourselves, and we will move out to this new star and find them. And we will even the score.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-13.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
