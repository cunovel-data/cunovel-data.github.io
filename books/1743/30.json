It was necessary - a touch of home, a return to the roots, a gathering of renewed strength.\\n\\n This time, however, D\u0027Aubisson, had \u0027moved upward\u0027 (the usual phrase for passing from Erythro to Rotor) a bit earlier than her schedule had called for. She had, indeed, been summoned by Commissioner Pitt.\\n\\n She sat in Janus Pitt\u0027s office, noting with her skilled eyes the small signs of aging that had accumulated since she had last seen him several years before. She did not, in the ordinary course of her work, have frequent occasions to see him, of course.\\n\\n His voice, however, was as strong as ever, his eyes as sharp, and she noted no decline in mental vigor.\\n\\n Pitt said, \u0027I have received your report on the incident outside the Dome, and I recognize the caution with which you approached your diagnosis of the situation. But now, off the record and unofficially, exactly what happened to Genarr? This room is shielded and you can talk freely.\u0027\\n\\n D\u0027Aubisson said dryly, \u0027I\u0027m afraid that my report, cautious as it was, happens to be truthful and complete. We don\u0027t really know what happened to Commander Genarr. The brain scan showed changes, but these were extraordinarily small and did not correspond to anything in our past experience. And they were reversible, since they did, in fact, quickly reverse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But something did happen to him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes, but that\u0027s the point. We can\u0027t say anything more than \"something\".\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Some form of the Plague, perhaps?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027None of the symptoms that have been detected in the past were found in this case.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But in the old days of the Plague, brain scanning was still comparatively primitive. You would not have detected the symptoms you have detected now in the past, so it might still be a mild form of the Plague, might it not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We could say so, but we could not present real evidence to that effect, and, in any case, Genarr is now normal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He seems normal, I suppose, but we don\u0027t really know if there might not be a relapse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Neither is there any reason to suppose there might be.\u0027\\n\\n A fleeting look of impatience crossed the Commissioner\u0027s face. \u0027You\u0027re sparring with me, D\u0027Aubisson. You know perfectly well that Genarr\u0027s position is one of considerable importance. The situation in the Dome is always precarious, since we never know if and when the Plague will strike again. Genarr\u0027s value was that he seemed immune to it, but we can scarcely consider him immune now. Something happened, and we must be prepared to replace him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is your decision to make, Commissioner. I am not suggesting replacement as a medical necessity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027ll keep him under close observation, and you\u0027ll keep the possibility of such a necessity in mind, I hope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I would consider that part of my medical duties.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Especially since if there is to be a replacement, I have been considering you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Considering me?\u0027 A small flash of excitement crossed her face before she could suppress it.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, why not? It\u0027s well known that I\u0027ve never been enthusiastic about the project of colonizing Erythro. I have always felt it necessary to retain the mobility of humanity and not to allow ourselves to be trapped into slavery to a large planet again. Nevertheless, it would be wise if we could colonize the planet not as a place intended primarily for population but as a vast resource - rather as we treated the Moon in the old Solar System. But we can\u0027t do that if the Plague hangs over our heads, can we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, we can\u0027t, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So our real task, to begin with, is to solve that problem. We never have. The Plague just died down and we have accepted that - but this latest incident shows us that the danger is not yet gone. Whether Genarr suffered a touch of the Plague or not, he certainly suffered something, and I want the matter now given top priority. You would be the natural person to head that project.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d be glad to accept the responsibility. It would mean doing what I am, in any case, trying to do, but with greater authority. I hesitate at supposing that I ought to be the Erythro Dome Commander.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As you said, that\u0027s for me to decide. I take it you would not refuse the post if it were offered to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Commissioner. I would be greatly honored.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Pitt dryly. \u0027And what happened to the girl?\u0027\\n\\n For a moment, D\u0027Aubisson seemed taken aback by the sudden change in subject. She all but stammered as she repeated, \u0027The girl?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, the girl who was outside the Dome with Genarr, the one who removed her protective suit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Marlene Fisher?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s her name. What happened to her?\u0027\\n\\n D\u0027Aubisson hesitated. \u0027Why, nothing, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So it says in the report. But I\u0027m asking you now. Nothing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing detectable by brain scan or in any other way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean that at the same time that Genarr, wearing an E-suit, was struck down, the girl, this Marlene Fisher, without an E-suit, suffered nothing?\u0027\\n\\n D\u0027Aubisson shrugged. \u0027Nothing at all, as far as we could tell.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you consider that strange?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s a strange young woman. Her brain scan-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know about her brain scan. I know also that she has peculiar abilities. Have you noted that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes. I have indeed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how do her abilities strike you? Mind reading, by any chance?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Commissioner. That\u0027s impossible. The concept of telepathy is a mere fantasy. I wish it were mind reading, in fact, since that would not be so dangerous. Thoughts can be placed under control.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is it about her that is more dangerous?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Apparently, she reads body language and we can\u0027t control that. Every motion speaks.\u0027 She said it with a touch of bitterness that Pitt did not fail to note.\\n\\n He said, \u0027Did you have a personal experience of that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly.\u0027 D\u0027Aubisson looked grim. \u0027It is impossible to be near the young woman without experiencing some of the inconvenience of her habit of perception.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but what happened?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing of tremendous importance, but it was annoying.\u0027 D\u0027Aubisson flushed and, for a moment, her lips pressed together as though she were thinking of defying her interrogator. But that moment passed. She said, almost in a whisper, \u0027after I had examined Dome Commander Genarr, Marlene asked me how he was. I told her that he was not seriously harmed and that there was every hope that he would recover completely.\\n\\n \u0027She said, \"Why does that disappoint you?\"\\n\\n \u0027I was taken aback and said, \"I\u0027m not disappointed. I\u0027m pleased.\"\\n\\n \u0027She said, \"But you are disappointed. That is quite clear. You\u0027re impatient.\"\\n\\n \u0027It was the first time I had encountered that sort of thing directly, though I had heard about it from others, and I couldn\u0027t think of anything to do but challenge her. \"Why should I be impatient? For what?\"\\n\\n \u0027She looked at me solemnly with her large, dark and unsettling eyes. Then she said, \"It seems to be about Uncle Siever-\" \u0027\\n\\n Pitt interrupted. \u0027Uncle Siever? Is there a relationship?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I think it\u0027s only a term of affection. She said, \"It seems to be about Uncle Siever and I wonder if you want to replace him as Dome Commander.\"\\n\\n \u0027At that, I just turned and walked away.\u0027\\n\\n Pitt said, \u0027How did you feel when she told you this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was furious. Naturally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because she had maligned you? Or because she was correct?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, in a way-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no. Don\u0027t hedge, Doctor. Was she wrong or was she right? Were you sufficiently disappointed at Genarr\u0027s recovery for the girl to notice, or was the whole thing a stroke of her peculiar imagination?\u0027\\n\\n The words seemed to force themselves out of D\u0027Aubisson\u0027s lips. \u0027She sensed something that was really there.\u0027 She stared at Pitt defiantly. \u0027I\u0027m only human, and I have my impulses. And you yourself have now indicated that I might be offered the post, which would seem to mean you consider me qualified for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you are maligned in spirit - if not in fact,\u0027 said Pitt, without any sign of humor. \u0027But now consider- You have this young woman, who is peculiar, who is very strange, both as shown by the brain scan and by her behavior - and, in addition, she seems unaffected by the Plague. Clearly, there may be a connection between her neuronic pattern and her Plague resistance. Might she not be a useful tool for studying the Plague?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t say. I suppose it\u0027s conceivable.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t it be tested?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps, but how?\u0027\\n\\n Pitt said quietly, \u0027Let her be exposed to the influence of Erythro as much as possible.\u0027\\n\\n D\u0027Aubisson said thoughtfully, \u0027That is what she wants to do, as it happens, and Commander Genarr seems to be willing to let her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Then you will supply the medical backing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I understand. And if the young woman gets the Plague?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We must remember that the solution of the problem is more important than the welfare of a single individual. We have a world to win, and for that we might have to pay a sad but necessary price.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if Marlene is destroyed and that does not help us understand or counteract the Plague?\u0027\\n\\n Pitt said, \u0027That risk must be faced. After all, it might also be that she will remain untouched and that that untouchability, carefully studied, may give us the means of a breakthrough in understanding the Plague. In that case, we win without loss.\u0027\\n\\n It was only afterward, when D\u0027Aubisson had left for her Rotorian apartment, that Pitt\u0027s iron resolution permitted him to think of himself as Marlene Fisher\u0027s confirmed enemy. True victory would be to have Marlene destroyed and the Plague remain unsolved. At a stroke he would be rid of an inconvenient girl who might otherwise, someday, produce young like herself; and of an inconvenient world that might otherwise, someday, produce a population as undesirable, as dependent, and as immobile as Earth\u0027s population had been.\\n\\n 64\\n\\n The three of them sat together in the Erythro Dome - Siever Genarr watchful, Eugenia Insigna deeply concerned, and Marlene Fisher clearly impatient.\\n\\n Insigna said, \u0027Now, remember, Marlene, do not stare at Nemesis. I know you\u0027ve been warned about the infrared, but it\u0027s also a fact that Nemesis is a mild flare star. Every once in a while there\u0027s an explosion on its surface and a burst of white light. It just lasts a minute or two, but that will be enough to shock your retinas, and you can\u0027t tell when it\u0027s going to happen.\u0027\\n\\n Genarr said, \u0027Can astronomers tell when it\u0027s going to happen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not so far. It\u0027s one of the many chaotic aspects of nature. We have not yet worked out the rules underlying stellar turbulence and there are some among us who think the rules can never be worked out entirely. They are simply too complex.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Interesting,\u0027 said Genarr.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not that we\u0027re not grateful to the flares. Three per cent of the energy reaching Erythro from Nemesis is the result of those flares.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t sound like much.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is, though. Without the flares, Erythro would be an icy world and much less easy to live on. The flares do make problems for Rotor, which has to adjust its use of sunlight quickly whenever there\u0027s a flare, and strengthen its particle-absorption field.\u0027\\n\\n Marlene was looking from one to the other as they spoke, and she finally broke in with a small note of exasperation, \u0027How long are you two going to keep this up? It\u0027s just to keep me sitting here. I can tell that very easily.\u0027\\n\\n Insigna said hastily, \u0027Where will you go when you\u0027re out there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just around. To the little river, or creek, or whatever it is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because it\u0027s interesting. Just flowing water in the open, and you can\u0027t see the ends, and you know it\u0027s not being pumped back to the beginning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it is,\u0027 said Insigna, \u0027by the heat of Nemesis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t count. I mean human beings aren\u0027t doing it. Besides, I just want to stand there and watch it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t drink from it,\u0027 said Insigna severely. \u0027I don\u0027t intend to. I can last an hour without drinking. If I get hungry, or thirsty - or anything else - I\u0027ll come back. You\u0027re making such a fuss over nothing.\u0027\\n\\n Genarr smiled. \u0027I suppose you want to recycle everything right here in the Dome.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, of course. Wouldn\u0027t anyone?\u0027\\n\\n Genarr\u0027s smile broadened. He said, \u0027You know, Eugenia, I\u0027m quite certain that living in Settlements has changed humanity permanently. The necessity of cycling is now ingrained in us. On Earth, you just threw things away, assuming it would recycle naturally, and, of course, sometimes it didn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Genarr,\u0027 said Insigna, \u0027you\u0027re a dreamer. It may be posssible for human beings to learn good habits under pressure, but relieve the pressure and the bad habits are back at once. Downhill is easier than uphill. It\u0027s called the second law of thermodynamics, and if we ever do colonize Erythro, I predict that we will litter it from end to end in no time at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, we won\u0027t,\u0027 said Marlene.\\n\\n Genarr said in a tone of polite inquiry, \u0027Why not, dear?\u0027\\n\\n And Marlene said with impatient force, \u0027Because we won\u0027t. Now can I go out?\u0027\\n\\n Genarr looked at Insigna and said, \u0027We might as well let her go, Eugenia. We can\u0027t hold her back for ever. Besides, for what it\u0027s worth, Ranay D\u0027Aubisson, who just got back from Rotor, went over all the records from the start and told me yesterday that Marlene\u0027s brain scan seems so stable that she is convinced that Marlene will come to no harm on Erythro.\u0027\\n\\n Marlene, who had turned toward the door, as though ready to walk to the airlock, now turned back. \u0027Wait, Uncle Siever, I almost forgot. You must be careful of Dr D\u0027Aubisson.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why? She\u0027s an excellent neurophysicist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not what I mean. She was pleased when you were in trouble after your trip outside and pretty disappointed when you got better.\u0027\\n\\n Insigna looked surprised and said automatically, \u0027What makes you say that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I don\u0027t understand that. Siever, don\u0027t you get along with D\u0027Aubisson?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, I do. We get along very well. Never a cross word. But if Marlene says-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mightn\u0027t Marlene be wrong?\u0027\\n\\n Marlene said at once, \u0027But I\u0027m not.\u0027\\n\\n Genarr said, \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right, Marlene.\u0027 Then, to Insigna, \u0027D\u0027Aubisson is an ambitious woman. If anything happens to me, she\u0027s the logical choice as my successor. She\u0027s had a great deal of experience down here and she\u0027s surely the best person to deal with the Plague if it lifts its head again. What\u0027s more, she\u0027s older than I am and may not feel there\u0027s much time to waste. I couldn\u0027t blame her if she was anxious to succeed me, and if her heart lifted a bit when I was ill. The chances are she\u0027s not even consciously aware of these feelings.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, she is,\u0027 said Marlene ominously. \u0027She knows all about it. You watch out, Uncle Siever.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I will. Are you ready now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I\u0027m ready.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then let me walk you to the airlock. You come with us, Eugenia, and try not to look so tragic.\u0027\\n\\n And so it was that Marlene stepped out on to the surface of Erythro, alone and unprotected, for the first time. It was, by Earth Standard time, 9.20 p.m., 15 January 2237. By Erythro time, it was midmorning. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-30.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
