It was the first time he had seen it, and a quick glance at Tessa Wendel made it quite plain that she was smiling with what he could only think of as proprietary pride.\n It sat there in a huge cavern, inside a triple web of security barriers. There were human beings present, but most of the work force consisted of carefully computerized (nonhumanoid) robots.\n Fisher had seen many spaceships in his time, and of a multiplicity of models used for a multiplicity of purposes, but he had never seen one like the Superluminal - never seen one as repulsive in appearance.\n Had he seen it without knowing what it was, he might not have guessed, even, that it was a spaceship. What did he say then? On the one hand, he did not want to anger Wendel. On the other hand, she was clearly waiting for his opinion, and she just as clearly expected praise.\n And so he said in a somewhat subdued voice, \u0027It has an eerie kind of grace - rather wasplike.\u0027\n She had smiled at the phrase \u0027eerie kind of grace,\u0027 and Fisher felt he had chosen well. But then she said, \u0027What do you mean \"wasplike,\" Crile?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s an insect I\u0027m referring to,\u0027 said Crile. \u0027I know you\u0027re not aware of insects much on Adelia.\u0027\n \u0027We know about insects,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027We may not have Earth\u0027s chaotic profusion-\u0027\n \u0027You probably don\u0027t have wasps. Stinging insects, shaped rather like-\u0027 He pointed to the Superluminal. \u0027They, too, have a large bulge in front, another bulge in back, and a narrow connecting unit.\u0027\n \u0027Really?\u0027 She looked at the Superluminal with a sudden sparking of new interest. \u0027Find me a picture of a wasp when you can. I might understand the ship design better in the light of the insect - or vice versa, for that matter.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027Why the shape, then, if it wasn\u0027t inspired by the wasp?\u0027\n \u0027We had to find a geometry that would maximize the chance of the entire ship moving as a unit. The hyperfield has a tendency to extend outward cylindrically to infinity, actually, and you let it have its way, to some extent. On the other hand, you don\u0027t want to give in entirely. You can\u0027t, in fact, so you have to seal it off in the bulges. The field is just within the hull, maintained and enclosed by an intense and alternating electromagnetic field, and - you don\u0027t really want to hear all this, do you?\u0027\n \u0027Not any more, I think,\u0027 said Fisher, smiling slightly. \u0027I\u0027ve heard enough. But since I\u0027m finally allowed to see this-\u0027\n \u0027Now don\u0027t be hurt,\u0027 said Wendel, putting her arm around his waist. \u0027It was all strictly on a need-to-know basis. There were times when they hated having me around. They kept muttering, I imagine, about this suspicious Settler who was entirely too nosy, and wishing that I hadn\u0027t been the one who had designed the hyper-field, so they could kick me out. Now, however, things have lightened to the point where I could arrange to have you come and see it. You\u0027ll be on it eventually, after all, and I want you to admire it.\u0027 She hesitated, then added, \u0027And me.\u0027\n He looked across at her and said, \u0027You know that I admire you, Tessa, without any need for anything like this.\u0027 And he put his arm around her shoulder.\n \u0027I\u0027m continuing to get older, Crile,\u0027 she said. \u0027The process simply won\u0027t stop. And I\u0027m also dismayingly satisfied with you. I\u0027ve been with you seven years now, going on eight, and I haven\u0027t felt the old urge to see what other men might be like.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027Is that a tragedy? Perhaps it\u0027s just the fact that you\u0027ve been so absorbed in the project. Now that the ship is completed, you\u0027ll probably have a feeling of release, and enough time to begin hunting again.\u0027\n \u0027No. I haven\u0027t the urge. I just haven\u0027t. But how about you? I know I neglect you at times.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s all right. When you neglect me for your work, that suits me. I want the ship as much as you do, dear, and one nightmare is that by the time it is finally ready, you and I will be too old to be allowed on.\u0027 He smiled again, this time with distinct ruefulness. \u0027In your awareness of oncoming age, Tessa, don\u0027t forget that I, too, am no longer a lad. In less than two years, I\u0027ll be fifty. But I have a question I\u0027m reluctant to ask for fear of disappointment, but I\u0027m going to, anyway.\u0027\n \u0027Ask away.\u0027\n \u0027You arranged to have me see the ship, to be allowed into this holy of holies. Somehow I don\u0027t think that Koropatsky would have allowed this if the project weren\u0027t near completion. He\u0027s almost as diseased on security as Tanayama was.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, as far as the hyperfield is concerned, the ship is ready.\u0027\n \u0027Has it flown?\u0027\n \u0027Not yet. There are still things to do, but they don\u0027t involve the hyperfield itself.\u0027\n \u0027There have to be test flights, I suppose.\u0027\n \u0027With a crew aboard, of course. There\u0027s no way of doing it crewless and still feel that the life-support systems will work. Even animals won\u0027t give us the necessary assurance.\u0027\n \u0027Who will go on the first trip?\u0027\n \u0027Volunteers chosen from among those on the project who qualify.\u0027\n \u0027How about you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m the only one who won\u0027t be a volunteer. I must go. I could trust no-one else to make decisions in an emergency.\u0027\n \u0027Then I go, too?\u0027 said Crile.\n \u0027No, not you.\u0027\n Fisher\u0027s face instantly grew dark with anger. \u0027The arrangement was-\u0027\n \u0027Not on the test flights, Crile.\u0027\n \u0027When will they be over, then?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s hard to say. It depends on what troubles may develop. If all goes as smoothly as possible, then two or three flights might suffice. A matter of months.\u0027\n \u0027When will the first test flight be?\u0027\n \u0027That I don\u0027t know, Crile. We\u0027re still working on the ship.\u0027\n \u0027You said it was ready to go.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, as far as the hyperfield is concerned. But we\u0027re installing the neuronic detectors.\u0027\n \u0027What are those? I never heard you mention them.\u0027\n Wendel did not answer directly. She looked around, quietly and thoughtfully, then said, \u0027We\u0027re attracting attention, Crile, and I suspect that there are people here who feel nervous about your presence. Let\u0027s go home.\u0027\n Fisher did not move. \u0027I take it you refuse to discuss this with me. Even though it happens to be vital to me.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll discuss it - at home.\u0027\n 53\n Crile Fisher was restless, his fury increasing. He refused to sit down and towered over Tessa Wendel, who had shrugged and taken a seat on the white modular couch and was now looking up at him, frowning.\n \u0027Why are you angry, Crile?\u0027\n Fisher\u0027s lips were trembling. He pressed them together and waited before answering, as though forcing himself to remain calm by sheer muscular effort.\n He said finally, \u0027Once a crew is made up without me, it will be a precedent. I won\u0027t ever get on. It must be understood from the beginning that I am on the ship every time until we reach the Neighbor Star - and Rotor. I don\u0027t want to be left out.\u0027\n Wendel said, \u0027Why do you jump at conclusions? You won\u0027t be omitted at the crucial time. The ship isn\u0027t even ready to go yet.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027You said the ship was ready. What are these neuronic detectors you\u0027re suddenly speaking of? It\u0027s a device to keep me quiet, to keep me distracted, and then sneak the ship away before I realize I\u0027m left out. That\u0027s what they\u0027re doing. And you\u0027re playing along with it.\u0027\n \u0027Crile, you\u0027re mad. The neuronic detector is my idea, my insistence, my desire.\u0027 She stared at him, unblinking, daring him to do something about it. \u0027Your idea!\u0027 he exploded. \u0027But...\u0027 She held out her hand as if to silence him. \u0027It\u0027s something we\u0027ve been working on concurrently with the ship. It\u0027s not something that falls within my expertise, but I have driven the neurophysicists onward rather mercilessly to have it. And the reason? Precisely because I want you on the ship when it leaves for the Neighbor Star. Don\u0027t you see?\u0027 He shook his head.\n \u0027Figure it out, Crile. You would if you weren\u0027t blind with rage for no sane reason. It\u0027s perfectly straightforward. It\u0027s a \"neuronic detector\". It detects nerve activity at a distance. Complex nerve activity. In short, it detects the presence of intelligence.\u0027\n Fisher stared at her. \u0027You mean what doctors use in hospitals.\u0027\n \u0027Of course. It\u0027s a routine tool in medicine and in psychology to detect mental disorders early on - but at meter distances. I need it at astronomical distances. It\u0027s not something new. It\u0027s something old with a vastly increased range. Crile, if Marlene\u0027s alive, she\u0027ll be on the Settlement, on Rotor. Rotor will be there, somewhere, circling the star. I told you that it would not be easy to spot. If we don\u0027t find it quickly, can we be sure that it\u0027s not there - and not that we just somehow missed it, like missing an island in the ocean or an asteroid in space? Do we just continue searching for months, or years, to make sure that we haven\u0027t just missed it, that it\u0027s really not there?\u0027\n \u0027And the neuronic detector-\u0027\n \u0027Will find Rotor for us.\u0027\n \u0027Won\u0027t it be just as hard to detect-\u0027\n \u0027No, it won\u0027t. The Universe is overrun with light and radio waves and all kinds of radiation, and we\u0027ll have to distinguish one source from a thousand others, or from a million others. It can be done, but it\u0027s not easy, and it may take time. However, to get the precise electromagnetic radiation associated with neurons in complex relationship is quite unique. We are not likely to have more than one source exactly like that - or if we do, it\u0027s because Rotor has built another Settlement. There you have it. I am as intent on finding your daughter for you as you are for finding her for yourself. And why would I do that if I weren\u0027t intent on having you on the flight with us? You\u0027ll be there.\u0027\n Fisher looked overwhelmed. \u0027And you forced the entire project to do this?\u0027\n \u0027I have considerable power over them, Crile. And there\u0027s more to it as well. This is highly confidential; that\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t tell you at the ship.\u0027\n \u0027Oh? And what might that be?\u0027\n Wendel said, and there was a softness in her voice, \u0027Crile, I spend more time thinking of you than you think. You don\u0027t know how strongly I want to spare you disappointment. What if we find nothing at the Neighbor Star? What if a sweep of the skies tells us definitely that there are no living intelligent life-forms anywhere in its vicinity? Do we go straight home and report that we found no sign of Rotor? Now, Crile, don\u0027t go into one of your moods. I\u0027m not saying that failure to find intelligence at the Neighbor Star will necessarily imply that Rotor and its people have not survived.\u0027\n \u0027What else can it imply?\u0027\n \u0027They might have been so dissatisfied with the Neighbor Star that they decided to move on elsewhere. Perhaps they stopped long enough to mine some asteroids for new materials they would need for construction and for refurbishing the micro-fusion motors. Then on they would go.\u0027\n \u0027And if that were so, how can we know where they would be?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027ve been gone almost fourteen years. With hyper-assistance, they can travel only at the speed of light. If they have reached any star and settled in its neighborhood, it would have to be at a star within fourteen light-years distance of us. There are not very many of those. At superluminal velocity, we can visit each of those. With neuronic detectors, we can quickly decide whether Rotor is in the neighborhood of any of them.\u0027\n \u0027They might be wandering through space between stars at this very moment. How would we detect them then?\u0027\n \u0027We wouldn\u0027t, but at least we increase our own chances just a bit if we investigate a dozen stars in six months with our neuronic detector, instead of spending that much time investigating one star in a futile search. And if we fail - and we have to face the fact that we might fail - then at least we will return with considerable data on a dozen different stars, a white dwarf, a blue-white hot star, a Solar look-alike, a close binary, and so on. We\u0027re not likely to make more than one trip in our lifetime, so why not make it a good one, and go down in history with a huge bang, eh, Crile?\u0027\n Crile said thoughtfully, \u0027I suppose you\u0027re right, Tessa. To comb a dozen stars and find nothing will be bad enough, but to search a single star vicinity and return thinking that Rotor might have been somewhere else that was reachable but that we lacked the time to explore would be much worse.\u0027\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll try to remember that,\u0027 said Crile sadly.\n \u0027Another thing,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027The neuronic detector might detect intelligence not of Earthly origin. We wouldn\u0027t want to miss it.\u0027\n Fisher looked startled. \u0027But that\u0027s not likely, is it?\u0027\n \u0027Not at all likely, but if it happens, all the more reason not to miss it. Especially if it is within fourteen light-years of Earth. Nothing in the Universe can be as interesting as another intelligent life-form - or as dangerous. We\u0027d want to know about it.\u0027\n Fisher said, \u0027What are the chances of detecting it at all if it is not of Earthly origin? The neuronic detectors are geared for human intelligence only. It seems to me that we wouldn\u0027t even recognize a really odd life-form as being alive, let alone as being intelligent.\u0027\n Wendel said, \u0027We may not be able to recognize life, but we can\u0027t possibly fail to recognize intelligence, in my view, and it\u0027s not life but intelligence that we\u0027re after. Whatever intelligence might be, however strange, however unrecognizable, it has to involve a complex structure, a very complex structure - at least as complex as the human brain. What\u0027s more, it\u0027s bound to involve the electromagnetic interaction. Gravitational attraction is too weak; the strong and weak nuclear interactions are too short-range. And as for this new hyperfield we\u0027re working with in superluminal flight, it doesn\u0027t exist in nature as far as any of us knows, but exists only when it is devised by intelligence.\n \u0027The neuronic detector can detect an elaborately complex electromagnetic field that will signify intelligence no matter the form or chemistry into which that intelligence may be molded. And we will be ready to either learn or run. As for unintelligent life, that is not at all likely to be dangerous to a technological civilization such as ourselves - though any form of alien life, even at the virus stage, would be interesting.\u0027\n \u0027And why must all this be kept secret?\u0027\n \u0027Because I suspect - in fact, I know - that the Global Congress will want us back very quickly so that they can be sure the project is successful and so that they can learn to build better models of superluminal vessels based on our experience with this prototype. I, on the other hand, if things go well, would certainly want to see the Universe and let them wait. I don\u0027t say I\u0027ll definitely do it, but I want the option held open. If they knew I was planning that - even thinking it - I suspect they would try to crew the ship with others whom they would consider more amenable to orders.\u0027\n Fisher smiled weakly.\n Wendel said, \u0027What\u0027s wrong, Crile? Suppose there\u0027s no sign of Rotor or its people. Would you then just want to go back to Earth in disappointment? The Universe at your fingertips, but given up?\u0027\n \u0027No. I\u0027m just wondering how long will it take to put in the detectors and all the other things you might dream up. In a little over two years, I\u0027ll be fifty. At fifty, agents working for the Office are routinely taken off field duty. They get desk jobs on Earth and are no longer allowed to take space-flights.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027\n \u0027In a little over two years, I will no longer qualify for the flight. They\u0027ll tell me I\u0027m too old, and the Universe won\u0027t be at my fingertips after all.\u0027\n \u0027Nonsense! They\u0027re going to let me go and I\u0027m over fifty right now.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a special case. It\u0027s your ship.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a special case, too, since I will insist on you. Besides, they won\u0027t find it so easy to get qualified people to go on the Superluminal. It will be all we can do to persuade anyone to volunteer. And they\u0027ll have to volunteer; we can\u0027t risk placing the trip into the hands of unwilling and frightened draftees.\u0027\n \u0027Why wouldn\u0027t they volunteer?\u0027\n \u0027Because they\u0027re Earthmen, my good Crile, and to almost all Earthmen, space is a horror. Hyperspace is a greater horror still and they\u0027re going to hang back. There is going to be you and me, and we\u0027re going to need three more volunteers and I tell you we\u0027ll have trouble getting them. I\u0027ve sounded out many, and I have two good people with a halfway promise: Chao-Li Wu and Henry Jarlow. I haven\u0027t got my third yet. And even if, against all likelihood, there are as many as a dozen volunteers, they\u0027re not going to cut you out in favor of anyone else, for I will insist on your going with me as my ambassador to the Rotorians - if that becomes necessary. And if even that is not enough, I promise you that the ship will take off before you\u0027re fifty.\u0027\n And now Fisher smiled with honest relief and said, \u0027Tessa, I love you. You know, I really do.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Wendel, \u0027I don\u0027t know that you really do, especially when you say it in that tone of voice, as though the admission has caught you by surprise. It\u0027s very odd, Crile, but in the almost eight years we\u0027ve known each other, and lived together, and made love to each other, you\u0027ve never once said that.\u0027\n \u0027Haven\u0027t I?\u0027\n \u0027Believe me, I\u0027ve listened. Do you know what else is odd? I\u0027ve never said that I loved you, and yet, I love you. It didn\u0027t start that way. What do you suppose happened?\u0027\n Fisher said in a low voice, \u0027It may be that we\u0027ve fallen in love with each other so gradually that we never noticed. That may happen sometimes, don\u0027t you think?\u0027\n And they smiled at each other shyly, as though wondering what they ought to do about it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-25.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
