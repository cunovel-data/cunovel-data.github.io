{"id":70503,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"45 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 said Siever Genarr, looking down his long nose at mother and daughter with an expression that seemed to beg their pardon even without his words. \u0027I had told Marlene that this job was not a very busy one and then almost immediately thereafter we had a kind of minicrisis with our power supply and I found I had to delay this conference of ours. The crisis is over, however, and wasn\u0027t much to begin with, now that we can view it in hindsight. Am I forgiven?\u0027 \u0027Of course, Siever,\u0027 said Eugenia Insigna. She was clearly restless. \u0027I won\u0027t say it\u0027s been an easy three days, though. I feel that every hour we stay here increases Marlene\u0027s danger.\u0027 Marlene said, \u0027I don\u0027t fear Erythro at all, Uncle Siever.\u0027 Insigna said, \u0027And I don\u0027t think Pitt can do anything against us on Rotor. He knows that, or he wouldn\u0027t have sent us here.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027And I will try to play the honest broker and satisfy you both. Whatever Pitt can or cannot do openly, there is a great deal he can do indirectly, so it\u0027s dangerous, Eugenia, for you to let your fear of Erythro lead you to underestimate Pitt\u0027s resolve and ingenuity. To begin with, if you return to Rotor, you will be doing so against his emergency ruling and he can imprison you or send you into exile on New Rotor or even send you back here. \u0027As for Erythro, we don\u0027t dare underestimate the danger of the Plague either, even though it seems to have died out in its virulent early form. I am as reluctant to risk Marlene as you are, Eugenia.\u0027 And Marlene whispered in exasperation, \u0027There\u0027s no risk.\u0027 Insigna said, \u0027Siever, I don\u0027t think we should carry on this discussion of Marlene in her presence.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re wrong. I want to do it in her presence. I suspect that she knows better than either of us what she ought to do. She is the caretaker of that mind of hers and it is our job to interfere with her as little as possible.\u0027 Insigna made an inarticulate sound in her throat, but Genarr went on, a quality of remorselessness entering his voice: \u0027I want her in this discussion because I want her input. I want her opinion.\u0027 Insigna said, \u0027But you know her opinion. She wants to go out there, and you\u0027re saying that we must let her do what she wants to do because she is somehow magical.\u0027 \u0027No-one said a word about magical, or about simply letting her go out. I would like to suggest we experiment, with all due precautions.\u0027 \u0027In what way?\u0027 \u0027To begin with, I would like a brain scan.\u0027 He turned to Marlene. \u0027Do you understand, Marlene, that that\u0027s necessary? Do you have any objections?\u0027 Marlene frowned slightly. \u0027I\u0027ve had brain scans. Everyone has had brain scans. They don\u0027t let you start school without a brain scan. Any time you have a complete medical examination-\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 said Genarr gently. \u0027I haven\u0027t completely wasted these last three days. I have here\u0027 - and his hand came to rest on a stack of computer strips at the left end of his desk - \u0027the computerization of every single brain scan you\u0027ve ever had.\u0027 \u0027But you\u0027re not telling everything, Uncle Siever,\u0027 said Marlene calmly. \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Insigna with a touch of triumph. \u0027What is he hiding, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s a little nervous about me. He doesn\u0027t entirely believe my feeling that I\u0027m safe. He\u0027s uncertain.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027How can that be, Marlene? I feel quite certain about your safety.\u0027 But Marlene said with a glow of sudden enlightenment, \u0027I think that\u0027s why you waited three days, Uncle Siever. You argued yourself into being certain so that I wouldn\u0027t see your uncertainty. But it didn\u0027t work. I can still see it.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027If that shows, Marlene, then it\u0027s only because I value you so highly that I find even the slightest risk unpleasant.\u0027 Insigna said angrily, \u0027If you find even the slightest risk unpleasant, how do you suppose I feel, as a mother? So in your uncertainty, you obtain brain scans, violating Marlene\u0027s medical privacy.\u0027 \u0027I had to find out. And I did. They\u0027re insufficient.\u0027 \u0027Insufficient in what way?\u0027 \u0027In the early days of the Dome, when the Plague struck again and again, one of our concerns was to devise a more detailed brain scanner and a more efficiently programmed computer to interpret the data. This has never been transferred to Rotor. Pitt\u0027s exaggerated desire to hide the Plague led him to resist the sudden appearance of an improved brain scanner on Rotor. It might have given rise to inconvenient questions and rumors. Ridiculous, to my way of thinking, but in this, as in many other things, Pitt had his way. Therefore, Marlene, you have never been properly brain scanned and I want you to have one on our device.\u0027 Marlene shrank back, \u0027No.\u0027 A look of hope crossed Insigna\u0027s face. \u0027Why not, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Because when Uncle Siever said that - he was suddenly much more uncertain.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027No, that\u0027s not-\u0027 He stopped himself, lifted his arms, and let them drop helplessly. \u0027Why do I bother? Marlene, dear, if I seemed suddenly concerned, it\u0027s because we need as detailed a brain scan as possible to serve as a standard of mental normality. Then, if you are exposed to Erythro and suffer even the slightest mental distortion as a result, it can be detected by brain scan even when no-one can tell by simply looking at you or talking to you. Well, as soon as I mention a detailed brain scan, I think of the possibility of detecting an otherwise indetectable mental change - and the thought itself sparks an automatic concern. That\u0027s what you detect. Come, Marlene, how much uncertainty do you detect? Be quantitative.\u0027 But Marlene said, \u0027Not much, but it\u0027s there. The trouble is, I can only tell you\u0027re uncertain. I can\u0027t tell why. Maybe this special brain scan is dangerous.\u0027 \u0027How can it be? It has been used so - Marlene, you know Erythro won\u0027t hurt you. Don\u0027t you also know that the brain scan won\u0027t hurt you?\u0027 \u0027No, I don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Do you know that it will hurt you?\u0027 A pause and then Marlene said reluctantly, \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027But how can you be sure about Erythro and not sure about the brain scan?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. I just know that Erythro won\u0027t hurt me, but I don\u0027t know that the brain scan won\u0027t. Or will.\u0027 A smile crossed Genarr\u0027s face. It did not take unusual abilities to see that he was enormously relieved. Marlene said, \u0027Why does that make you feel good, Uncle Siever?\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Because if you were making up your intuitional feelings - out of a desire to be important, or out of general romanticism, or out of some sort of self-delusion - you would apply it to everything. But you don\u0027t. You pick and choose. Some things you know and some things you don\u0027t know. That makes me far more inclined to believe you when you claim to be sure Erythro won\u0027t hurt you and I no longer in the least fear that the brain scan will reveal anything disturbing.\u0027 Marlene turned to her mother. \u0027He\u0027s right, Mother. He feels much better and so I feel much better. It\u0027s so obvious. Can\u0027t you see it, too?\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what I see,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027I don\u0027t feel better.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Mother,\u0027 murmured Marlene. Then, more loudly to Genarr, \u0027I\u0027ll take the scan.\u0027 46 \u0027This is not surprising,\u0027 murmured Siever Genarr. He was watching the computer graphics in their intricate, almost floral patterns, as they moved slowly in and out in false color. Eugenia Insigna, at his side, stared at it keenly, but understood nothing. \u0027What is not surprising, Siever?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I can\u0027t tell you properly because I don\u0027t have their jargon down pat. And if Ranay D\u0027Aubisson, who\u0027s our local guru on this, were to explain it, neither you nor I would understand her. However, she did point this out to me-\u0027 \u0027It looks like a snail shell.\u0027 \u0027The color makes it stand out. It\u0027s a measure of complexity rather than a direct indication of physical form, Ranay says. This part is atypical. We don\u0027t find it in brains generally.\u0027 Insigna\u0027s lip trembled. \u0027You mean she\u0027s already affected?\u0027 \u0027No, of course not. I said atypical, not abnormal. Surely I don\u0027t have to explain that to an experienced scientific observer. You\u0027ll have to admit that Marlene is different. In a way, I\u0027m glad that the snail shell is there. If her brain were completely typical, we\u0027d have to wonder why she seems to be what she is; where the perceptivity is coming from. Is she cleverly faking it, or are we fools?\u0027 \u0027But how do you know it isn\u0027t something - something-\u0027 \u0027Diseased? How can that be? We have all of the brain scans collected over her lifetime from infancy. That atypicality was always there.\u0027 \u0027It was never reported to me. No-one ever remarked on it.\u0027 \u0027Of course not. Those early brain scans were the usual fairly primitive type and it wouldn\u0027t show, at least not so that it would hit you in the face. But, once we have this proper brain scan and can see the detail clearly, we can go back to the early ones and make it out. Ranay has already done so. I tell you, Eugenia, this advanced brain scanning technique ought to be standard on Rotor. Pitt\u0027s suppression of it is one of his most foolish moves. It\u0027s expensive, of course.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll pay,\u0027 murmured Insigna. \u0027Don\u0027t be silly. I\u0027m putting this one on the Dome budget. After all, this may be helpful in solving the Plague mystery. At least, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll claim if it\u0027s ever questioned. Well, there you are. Marlene\u0027s brain is recorded in greater complexity than ever before. If she should be even slightly affected, it will show on the screen.\u0027 \u0027You have no idea how frightening this is,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027I don\u0027t blame you, you know. But she is so confident that I can\u0027t help going along with her. I\u0027m convinced that this solid sense of security has meaning behind it.\u0027 \u0027How can it?\u0027 Genarr pointed to the snail shell. \u0027You don\u0027t have that, and I don\u0027t have it, so neither of us is in a position to tell where and how she gets her sense of security. But she has it, so we must let her out on the surface.\u0027 \u0027Why must we risk her? Can you possibly explain to me why we must risk her?\u0027 \u0027Two reasons. First, she does seem determined, and I have the feeling that she\u0027ll get whatever she\u0027s determined to get - sooner or later. In that case, we might as well be cheerful about it and send her off, since we won\u0027t be able to stop her for very long. Secondly, it\u0027s possible we\u0027ll learn something about the Plague as a result. What that might be, I can\u0027t say, but anything, however small, that will yield additional information concerning the Plague is worth a great deal.\u0027 \u0027Not my daughter\u0027s mind.\u0027 \u0027It won\u0027t come to that. For one thing, even though I have faith in Marlene and believe there\u0027s no risk, I will do what I can to minimize it for your sake. In the first place, we\u0027ll not let her out on to the surface itself for a while. I may take her out on a flight over Erythro, for instance. She\u0027ll see lakes and plains, hills, canyons. We might even go as far as the edge of the sea. It all has a stark beauty - I saw it once - but it is barren. There is no life anywhere that she can see - only the prokaryotes in the water, which are invisible, of course. It\u0027s possible that the uniform barrenness may repel her and she may lose interest in the outside altogether. \u0027If, however, she is still keen on going out, on feeling the soil of Erythro under her feet, we will see to it that she wears an E-suit.\u0027 \u0027What is an E-suit?\u0027 \u0027An Erythro-suit. It\u0027s a straightforward affair - like a spacesuit, except that it doesn\u0027t have to hold in air pressure against a vacuum. It\u0027s an impermeable combination of plastic and textile that\u0027s very light and doesn\u0027t impede motion. The helmet with its infrared shielding is somewhat more substantial and there is an artificial air supply and ventilation. What it amounts to is that the person in an E-suit is not subjected to the Erythro environment. And on top of that, there\u0027ll be someone with her.\u0027 \u0027Who? I would trust no-one with her but myself.\u0027 Genarr smiled. \u0027I couldn\u0027t imagine a less suitable companion. You know nothing about Erythro, really, and you\u0027re frightened of it. I wouldn\u0027t dare let you out there. Look, the only person we can trust is not you, but me.\u0027 \u0027You?\u0027 Insigna stared at him, open-mouthed. \u0027Why not? No-one here knows Erythro better than I do, and if Marlene is immune to the Plague, so am I. In ten years on Erythro, I haven\u0027t been affected in the slightest. What\u0027s more, I can fly an aircraft, which means we won\u0027t need a pilot. And then, too, if I go out with Marlene, I can watch her closely. If she does anything abnormal, no matter how slightly, I\u0027ll have her back in the Dome and under the brain scan faster than light.\u0027 \u0027By which time, of course, it will be too late.\u0027 \u0027No. Not necessarily. You mustn\u0027t look upon the Plague as an all-or-nothing matter. There have been light cases, even very light cases, and people who are lightly affected can live reasonably normal lives. Nothing will happen to her. I\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 Insigna sat in her chair, silent, seeming somehow small and defenseless. Genarr impulsively placed his arm around her. \u0027Come, Eugenia, forget this for a week. I promise she\u0027ll not go out for at least a week - longer than that if I can weaken her resolve by showing her Erythro from the air. And during the flight she will be enclosed in the aircraft and will be as safe there as she is here. As for right now, I\u0027ll tell you what - you\u0027re an astronomer, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 She looked at him and said, wanly, \u0027You know I am.\u0027 \u0027Then that means that you never look at the stars. Astronomers never do. They only look at their instruments. It\u0027s night over the Dome now, so let\u0027s go up to the observation deck and observe. The night is absolutely clear, and there is nothing like just looking at the stars to make one feel quiet and at peace. Trust me.\u0027 47 It was true. Astronomers did not look at the stars. There was no need. One gave instructions to the telescopes, the cameras, and the spectroscope by way of the computer, which received instructions in the way of programming. The instruments did the work, the analyses, the graphic simulations. The astronomer merely asked the questions, then studied the answers. For that, one didn\u0027t have to look at the stars. But then, she thought, how does one look at stars idly? Can one when one is an astronomer? The mere sight should make one uneasy. There was work to be done, questions to be asked, mysteries to be solved, and, after a while, surely one would return to one\u0027s workshop and set some instruments in motion while one distracted one\u0027s mind by reading a novel or watching a holovision spectacle. She muttered this to Siever Genarr, as he went about his office, checking loose ends before leaving. (He was a confirmed loose-end checker, Insigna remembered from the ancient days when they were all young. It had irritated her then, but perhaps she ought to have admired it. Siever had so many virtues, she thought, and Crile, on the other hand-) She dragged at her thoughts mercilessly and pointed them another way. Genarr was saying, \u0027Actually, I don\u0027t use the observation deck myself very often. There always seems to be something else to do. And when I do go, I almost always find myself alone up there. It will be pleasant to have company. Come!\u0027 He led the way to a small elevator. It was the first time Insigna had been in an elevator in the Dome, and, for a fleeting moment, it was as though she were back on Rotor - except that she felt no change in pseudo-gravitation pull and did not feel herself pressed gently against one of the walls through a Coriolis effect, as she would have been on Rotor. \u0027Here we are,\u0027 said Genarr, and motioned to Insigna to step out. She did so, curiously, into the empty chamber, and, almost at once, shrank back. She said, \u0027Are we exposed?\u0027 \u0027Exposed?\u0027 Genarr asked, bewildered. \u0027Oh, you mean, are we open to Erythro\u0027s atmosphere? No, no. Have no fears about that. We are enclosed in a hemisphere of diamond-coated glass which nothing scratches. A meteorite would smash it, of course, but the skies of Erythro are virtually meteor-free. We have such glass on Rotor, you know, but\u0027 - and his voice took on a tone of pride - \u0027not quite this quality, and not quite this size.\u0027 \u0027They treat you well down here,\u0027 said Insigna, reaching out gently to touch the glass again and assure herself of its existence. \u0027They must, to get people to come here.\u0027 Then, reverting to the bubble, \u0027It rains, of course, on occasion, but it\u0027s cloudy then anyway. And once the skies clear, it dries up quickly. A residue is left behind, and during the day, a special detergent mixture cleans the bubble. Sit down, Eugenia.\u0027 Insigna sat in a chair that was soft and comfortable and that reclined almost of its own accord, so that she found herself looking upward. She could hear another chair sigh softly as Genarr\u0027s weight pushed it backward. And then, the small night-lights, which had cast a glow sufficient to point out the presence and location of chairs and small tables in the room, went out. In the darkness of an uninhabited world, the sky, cloudless, and as dark as black velvet, burned with sparks. Insigna gasped. She knew what the sky was like in theory. She had seen it on charts and maps, in simulations and photographs - in every shape and way except reality. She found herself not picking out the interesting objects, the puzzling items, the mysteries that demanded she get to work. She didn\u0027t look at any one object, but at the patterns they made. In dim prehistory, she thought, it was the study of the patterns, and not of the stars themselves, that gave the ancients the constellations and the beginning of astronomy. Genarr was right. Peace, like a fine, unfelt cobweb, settled down over her. After a while, she said, almost sleepily, \u0027Thank you, Genarr.\u0027 \u0027For what?\u0027 \u0027For offering to go out with Marlene. For risking your mind for my daughter.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not risking my mind. Nothing will happen to either of us. Besides, I have a - a fatherly feeling toward her. After all, Eugenia, we go a long way back together, you and I, and I think - have always thought - highly of you.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 said Insigna, feeling the stirrings of guilt. She had always known how Genarr had felt - he could never obscure it. It had inspired her with resignation before she met Crile, and with annoyance afterward. She said, \u0027If I\u0027ve ever hurt your feelings, Siever, I am truly sorry.\u0027 \u0027No need,\u0027 said Genarr softly, and there was a long silence while peace deepened, and Insigna found herself earnestly hoping that no-one would enter and break the strange spell of serenity that held her fast. And then Genarr said, \u0027I have a theory as to why people don\u0027t come up to the observation deck here. Or on Rotor. Did you ever notice that the observation deck isn\u0027t used much on Rotor either?\u0027 \u0027Marlene liked to go there on occasion,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027She told me she was usually alone up there. In the last year or so, she would tell me that she liked to watch Erythro. I should have listened more closely - paid attention-\u0027 \u0027Marlene is unusual. I think what gets most people and keeps them from coming up here is that.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 asked Insigna. \u0027That,\u0027 said Genarr. He was pointing to some spot in the sky, but in the darkness she could not see his arm. \u0027That very bright star; the brightest in the sky.\u0027 \u0027You mean the Sun - our Sun - the Sun of the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I do. It\u0027s an interloper. Except for that bright star, the sky would be just about the same as the one we see from Earth. Alpha Centauri is rather out of place and Sirius is shifted slightly, but we wouldn\u0027t notice that. Barring such things, the sky you see is what the Sumerians saw five thousand years ago. All except for the Sun.\u0027 \u0027And you think the Sun keeps people away from the observation deck?\u0027 \u0027Yes, perhaps not consciously, but I think the sight of it makes them uneasy. The tendency is to think of the Sun as far, far away, unreachable, part of an altogether different Universe. Yet there it is in the sky, bright, demanding our attention, stirring up our guilt for having run away from it.\u0027 \u0027But then why don\u0027t the teenagers and children go to the observation deck? They know little or nothing of the Sun and the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027The rest of us set a negative example. When we\u0027re all gone, when there\u0027s no-one on Rotor to whom the Solar System is anything but a phrase, I think the sky will seem to belong to Rotor again, and this place will be crowded - if it still exists.\u0027 \u0027Do you think it won\u0027t still exist?\u0027 \u0027We can\u0027t foresee the future, Eugenia.\u0027 \u0027We seem to be flourishing and growing so far.\u0027 \u0027Yes, we are, but it\u0027s that bright star - the interloper - that I\u0027m worried about.\u0027 \u0027Our old Sun. What can it do? It can\u0027t reach us.\u0027 \u0027Sure it can.\u0027 Genarr was staring at the bright star in the western sky. \u0027The people we\u0027ve left behind on Earth and on the Settlements are bound to discover Nemesis eventually. Maybe they already have. And maybe they\u0027ve worked out hyper-assistance. I\u0027m of the opinion they must have developed hyper-assistance soon after we left. Our disappearance must have stimulated them greatly.\u0027 \u0027We left fourteen years ago. Why aren\u0027t they already here?\u0027 \u0027Perhaps they quail at the thought of a two-year flight. They know that Rotor attempted it, but they don\u0027t know that we succeeded at it. They may think that our wreckage is strewn through space all the way from the Sun to Nemesis.\u0027 \u0027We didn\u0027t lack the courage to attempt it.\u0027 \u0027Sure we did. Do you think that Rotor would have made the attempt if we hadn\u0027t had Pitt? It was Pitt who drove the rest of us, and I doubt that there\u0027s another Pitt anywhere in the Settlements, or on Earth for that matter. You know I don\u0027t like Pitt. I disapprove of his methods, of his morals, or the lack of them, of his deviousness, of his cold-blooded ability to send a girl like Marlene to what he clearly hopes will be her destruction, and yet if we go by results, he may go down in history as a great man.\u0027 \u0027As a great leader,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027You are a great man, Siever. There\u0027s a clear difference.\u0027 There was silence again, till Genarr said softly, \u0027I keep waiting for them to come here after us. That\u0027s my biggest fear, and it seems to strengthen when the interloper shines down upon me. It\u0027s fourteen years now since we left the Solar System. What have they been doing in these fourteen years? Have you ever wondered about that, Eugenia?\u0027 \u0027Never,\u0027 said Insigna, half-asleep. \u0027My worries are more immediate.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-22.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
