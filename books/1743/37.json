{"id":70518,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"86 Eugenia Insigna said in a tone that seemed to place her halfway between puzzlement and discontent, \u0027Marlene was singing this morning. Some song about: \"Home, home in the stars, where the worlds are all swinging and free.\" \u0027 \u0027I know the song,\u0027 said Siever Genarr, nodding. \u0027I\u0027d sing it for you, but I can\u0027t carry a tune.\u0027 They had just finished lunch. They had lunch together every day now, something Genarr looked forward to with quiet satisfaction, even though the subject of conversation was invariably Marlene and although Genarr felt that Insigna might be turning to him only out of desperation, since to whom else could she talk freely on the subject? He didn\u0027t care. Whatever the excuse- \u0027I never heard her sing before,\u0027 said Insigna. \u0027I always thought she couldn\u0027t. Actually, she has a pleasant contralto.\u0027 \u0027It must be a sign that she\u0027s happy now - or excited - or contented - or something good, Eugenia. My own feeling is that she\u0027s found her place in the Universe, found her unique reason for living. It\u0027s not given to all of us to find that. Most of us, Eugenia, drag onward, searching for life\u0027s personal meaning, not finding it, and ending with anything from roaring desperation to quiet resignation. I\u0027m the quietly resigned type myself.\u0027 Insigna managed to smile. \u0027I suspect you don\u0027t think that of me.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not roaringly desperate, Eugenia, but you do tend to continue to fight lost battles.\u0027 Her eyes dropped. \u0027Do you mean Crile?\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027If you think I do, then I do. But actually, I was thinking of Marlene. She\u0027s been out a dozen times. She loves it. It makes her happy, and yet you sit here fighting off terror. What is it, Eugenia, that bothers you about it?\u0027 Insigna ruminated, pushing her fork around on her plate. Then she said, \u0027It\u0027s the sense of loss. The unfairness of it. Crile made a choice and I lost him. Marlene has made a choice and I\u0027m losing her - if not to the Plague, then to Erythro.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 He reached for her hand, and she placed it, rather absently, in his. She said, \u0027Marlene is more and more eager to be out there in that absolute wilderness and less and less interested in being with us. Eventually, she will find a way of living out there and return at lengthening intervals - then be gone.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re probably right, but all of life is a symphony of successive losses. You lose your youth, your parents, your loves, your friends, your comforts, your health, and finally your life. To deny loss is to lose it all anyway and to lose, in addition, your self-possession and your peace of mind.\u0027 \u0027She was never a happy child, Siever.\u0027 \u0027Do you blame yourself for that?\u0027 \u0027I might have been more understanding.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s never too late to start. Marlene wanted a whole world and she has it. She wanted to convert what has always been a burdensome ability of hers into a method for communicating directly with another mind, and she has it. Would you force her to give that up? Would you avoid your own loss of her more or less continuous presence by inflicting on her a greater loss than you or I can conceive - the true use of her unusual brain?\u0027 Insigna actually laughed a little, though her eyes were swimming with tears. \u0027You could talk a rabbit out of its hole, Siever.\u0027 \u0027Could I? My speech was never as effective as Crile\u0027s silences.\u0027 Insigna said, \u0027There were other influences.\u0027 She frowned. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027re here now, Siever, and you\u0027re a great comfort to me.\u0027 Genarr said ruefully, \u0027It\u0027s the surest sign that I have reached my present age, that I am actually comforted at being a comfort to you. The fires burn low when we ask not for this or that, but for comfort.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with that, surely.\u0027 \u0027Nothing wrong in the world. I suspect there are many couples who have gone through the wilds of passion and the rites of ecstasy without ever finding comfort in each other and, in the end, they might have been willing to exchange it all for comfort. I don\u0027t know. The quiet victories are so quiet. Essential, but overlooked.\u0027 \u0027Like you, my poor Siever?\u0027 \u0027Now, Eugenia, I\u0027ve spent all my life trying to avoid the trap of self-pity and you mustn\u0027t tempt me into it just to watch me writhe.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Siever, I don\u0027t want to watch you writhe.\u0027 \u0027There, I just wanted to hear you say that. See how clever I am. But, you know, if you want a substitute for Marlene\u0027s presence, I am willing to hang around when you need comfort. Even a whole world to myself wouldn\u0027t tempt me from your side - if you didn\u0027t want me to go.\u0027 She squeezed his hand. \u0027I don\u0027t deserve you, Siever.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t use that as an excuse not to have me, Eugenia. I\u0027m willing to waste myself on you, and you shouldn\u0027t stop me from making a supreme sacrifice.\u0027 \u0027Have you found no-one worthier?\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t looked. Nor have I sensed among the women of Rotor any great demand for me. Besides, what would I do with a worthier object? How dull it would be to offer myself as a duly deserved gift. How much more romantic to be an undeserved gift, to be bounty from the skies.\u0027 \u0027To be godlike in your condescension to the unworthy.\u0027 Genarr nodded vigorously. \u0027I like that. Yes. Yes. That\u0027s exactly the picture that appeals to me.\u0027 Insigna laughed again, and more freely. \u0027You\u0027re crazy, too. You know, I never noticed that somehow.\u0027 \u0027I have hidden depths. As you get to know me still better - taking your time, of course-\u0027 He was interrupted by the sharp buzz of the message-receiver. He frowned. \u0027There you are, Eugenia. I get you to the point - I don\u0027t even remember how I did it - where you are ready to melt into my arms, and we\u0027re interrupted. Uh oh!\u0027 His voice suddenly changed completely. \u0027It\u0027s from Saltade Leverett.\u0027 \u0027Who\u0027s he?\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t know him. Hardly anyone does. He\u0027s the nearest thing to a hermit I\u0027ve ever met. He works in the asteroid belt because he likes it there, I haven\u0027t seen the old bum in years. I don\u0027t know why I say \"old\", though, because he\u0027s my age. \u0027It\u0027s sealed, too. Sealed to my thumbprints, I see. That makes it secret enough for me to ask you to leave before I open it.\u0027 Insigna rose at once, but Genarr motioned her down. \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, Eugenia. Secrecy is just the disease of officialdom. I pay no attention to it.\u0027 He pressed his thumb down on the sheet, then the other thumb in its appropriate place, and letters began to appear. Genarr said, \u0027I often thought that if a person lacked thumbs-\u0027 And then he fell silent. Still silent, he passed her the message. \u0027Am I allowed to read this?\u0027 Genarr shook his head, \u0027Of course not, but who cares? Read it.\u0027 She did so, almost at a glance, then looked up. \u0027An alien ship? About to land here?\u0027 Genarr nodded. \u0027At least that\u0027s what it says.\u0027 Insigna said wildly, \u0027But what about Marlene? She\u0027s out there.\u0027 \u0027Erythro will protect her.\u0027 \u0027How do you know? This may be a ship of aliens. Real aliens. Nonhumans. The thing on Erythro may have no power over them.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re aliens to Erythro, yet it can easily control us.\u0027 \u0027I must go out there.\u0027 \u0027What good-\u0027 \u0027I must be with her, Come with me. Help me. We\u0027ll bring her back into the Dome.\u0027 \u0027If these are all-powerful and malevolent invaders, we won\u0027t be safe inside-\u0027 \u0027Oh, Siever, is this a time for logic? Please. I must be with my daughter!\u0027 87 They had taken photographs and now they were studying them. Tessa Wendel shook her head. \u0027Unbelievable. The whole world is absolutely desolate. Except this.\u0027 \u0027Intelligence everywhere,\u0027 said Merry Blankowitz, her brow furrowed. \u0027No question about it now when we\u0027ve been so close. Desolate or not, intelligence is there.\u0027 \u0027But most intensely at that dome? Right?\u0027 \u0027Most intensely, Captain. Most easily noticeable. And most familiar. Outside the dome, there are slight differences, and I\u0027m not sure what it signifies.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027We\u0027ve never tested any high intelligence other than human, so, of course-\u0027 Wendel turned to him. \u0027Is it your opinion the intelligence outside the dome isn\u0027t human?\u0027 \u0027Since we agree that human beings couldn\u0027t have burrowed everywhere underground in thirteen years, what other conclusion is it possible to come to?\u0027 \u0027And the dome? Is that human?\u0027 Wu said, \u0027That\u0027s a different thing entirely, and doesn\u0027t depend on Blankowitz\u0027s plexons. There are astronomical instruments to be seen. The dome - or part of it - is an astronomical observatory.\u0027 \u0027Couldn\u0027t alien intelligences be astronomers as well?\u0027 asked Jarlow, a bit sardonically. \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Wu, \u0027but with instruments of their own. When I see what looks to me like an infrared computerized scanner of exactly the type I would see on Earth- Well, let\u0027s put it this way. Forget the nature of the intelligence. I see instruments that were either manufactured in the Solar System, or built from designs prepared in the Solar System. There is no question about that. I cannot conceive that alien intelligences, without contact with human beings, could have built such instruments.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027I agree with you, Wu. Whatever there is on this world, there are, or were, human beings under that dome.\u0027 Crile Fisher said sharply, \u0027Don\u0027t just say \"human beings\", Captain. There are Rotorians. There can be no other human beings on this world, excluding ourselves.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027And that\u0027s unanswerable, too.\u0027 Blankowitz said, \u0027It\u0027s such a small dome. Rotor must have had tens of thousands of people on it.\u0027 \u0027Sixty thousand,\u0027 murmured Fisher. \u0027They can\u0027t all fit into that dome.\u0027 \u0027For one thing,\u0027 said Fisher, \u0027there may be other domes. We could sweep around the world a thousand times and yet miss objects of all sorts.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s only this one place where there seemed to be a change in the plexon type. If there were other domes like that, I would have spotted a few more of them, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 Blankowitz said. \u0027Or,\u0027 said Fisher, \u0027another possibility is that what we see is a tiny bit of an entire structure which, for all we know, may spread out for miles below the surface.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027The Rotorians came in a Settlement. The Settlement may still exist. There may be many. This dome may be a mere outpost.\u0027 \u0027We haven\u0027t seen a Settlement,\u0027 said Jarlow. \u0027We haven\u0027t looked,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027We\u0027ve concentrated entirely on this world.\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t spotted intelligence anywhere but on this world,\u0027 said Blankowitz. \u0027You haven\u0027t looked, either,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027We\u0027d really have to scan the heavens to spot a Settlement or two, but once you detected plexons from this world, you looked nowhere else.\u0027 \u0027I will if you think it\u0027s necessary.\u0027 Wendel held up her hand. \u0027If there are Settlements, why haven\u0027t they spotted us? We\u0027ve made no attempt to shield our energy emissions. After all, we were pretty confident that this star system was empty.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027They may have had the same overconfidence, Captain. They haven\u0027t been looking for us, either, and so we\u0027ve slipped past them. Or, if they have detected us, they may be uncertain as to who - or what - we are, and they\u0027re hesitating as to what action to take, just as we are. What I say, though, is that we do know one spot on the surface of this large satellite where there must be human beings, and I think we must go down and make contact with them.\u0027 \u0027Do you think it would be safe to do so?\u0027 asked Blankowitz. \u0027My guess,\u0027 said Wu firmly, \u0027is that it would be. They can\u0027t shoot us out of hand. After all, they\u0027d want to know more about us before they do so. Besides, if all we dare do is stay here in uncertainty, then we will accomplish absolutely nothing and we ought to go back home and tell them what we have discovered. Earth will send out a whole fleet of superluminal vessels, but they won\u0027t be thankful to us if we come back with only minimal information. We\u0027ll go down in history as the expedition that flinched.\u0027 He smiled blandly. \u0027You see, Captain, I\u0027ve learned a few lessons from Fisher.\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027Then you think we should now go down and make contact.\u0027 \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027And you, Blankowitz?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m curious. Not about the dome, but about the possible alien life. I\u0027d want to find out about them, too.\u0027 \u0027Jarlow?\u0027 \u0027I wish we had adequate weapons, or hypercommunication. If we\u0027re wiped out, Earth will have found out nothing - absolutely nothing - as the result of our trip. Then it might be that someone else will come here as unprepared as we and just as unsure. Still, if we survive the contact, we\u0027ll be going back with important knowledge. I suppose we should chance it.\u0027 Fisher said quietly, \u0027Are you going to ask me for my opinion, Captain?\u0027 \u0027I assume that you wish to land to see the Rotorians.\u0027 \u0027Exactly, so may I suggest- Let\u0027s land as quietly as we can, and as unobtrusively, and I\u0027ll leave the ship to reconnoiter. If anything goes wrong, then take off and return to Earth, leaving me behind. I am dispensable, but the ship must return.\u0027 Wendel said at once, her face seeming to tighten, \u0027Why you?\u0027 Fisher said, \u0027Because I know the Rotorians, at least, and because I - wish to go.\u0027 \u0027I, too,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027I must be with you.\u0027 \u0027Why risk two?\u0027 asked Fisher. \u0027Because two are safer than one. Because, in case of trouble, one might escape while the other holds off the threat. And most of all, because, as you say, you know the Rotorians. Your judgement may be warped.\u0027 Wendel said, \u0027We will land, then. Fisher and Wu will leave the ship. If, at any time, Fisher and Wu disagree on procedure, Wu will be the decision-maker.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 demanded Fisher indignantly. \u0027Wu has said you know the Rotorians and your decisions may be warped,\u0027 said Wendel, looking at Fisher firmly, \u0027and I agree with him.\u0027 88 Marlene was happy. She felt as if she were wrapped in gentle arms, protected, shielded. She could see the reddish light of Nemesis and feel the wind against her cheeks. She could watch the clouds obscure part or all of Nemesis\u0027 large globe, now and then, so that the light would dim and turn grayish. But she could see as easily in the gray as in the red, and she could see in shades and tints that made fascinating patterns. And though the wind grew cooler when Nemesis\u0027 light was hidden, it never chilled her. It was as though Erythro were somehow enhancing her sight, somehow warming the air around her body when necessary, somehow caring for her in every way. And she could talk to Erythro. She had made up her mind to think of the cells that made up the life on Erythro as Erythro. As the planet. Why not? What else? Individually, the cells were only cells, as primitive - much more primitive, in fact - than the individual cells of her own body. It was only all of the prokaryote cells together that made up an organism that encircled the planet in a billion trillion tiny interconnected pieces, that so filled and permeated and grasped the planet, that it might as well be thought of as the planet. How odd, thought Marlene. This giant life-form must never, before the coming of Rotor, have known that anything live existed other than itself. Her questions and sensations did not have to exist entirely in her mind. Erythro would rise before her sometimes, like thin gray smoke, consolidating into a wraithlike human figure wavering at the edges. There was always, about it, a flowing feeling. She could not actually see that, but she sensed, beyond doubt, that millions of invisible cells were leaving each second and immediately being replaced by others. No one prokaryote cell could exist for long out of its water film, so that each was only evanescently part of the figure, but the figure itself was as permanent as it wished to be, and never lost its identity. Erythro did not take Aurinel\u0027s form again. It had gathered, without being told, that that was disturbing. Its appearance was neutral now, changing slightly with the vagaries of Marlene\u0027s own thought. Erythro could follow the delicate changes of her mind pattern far better, she decided, than she herself could, and the figure adjusted to that, looking more like some figure in her mind\u0027s eye at one moment, and then as she tried to focus on it and identify it, it would shift gently into something else. Occasionally, she could catch glimpses: the curve of her mother\u0027s cheek, Uncle Siever\u0027s strong nose, bits of the girls and boys she had met at school. It was an interactive symphony. It was not so much a conversation between them as a mental ballet she could not describe, something that was infinitely soothing, infinite in variety - partly changing appearance - partly changing voice - partly changing thought. It was a conversation in so many dimensions that the possibility of going back to communication that consisted only of speech left her feeling flat, lifeless. Her gift of sensing by body language flowered into something she had never imagined earlier. Thoughts could be exchanged far more swiftly - and deeply - than by the coarse crudeness of speech. Erythro explained - filled her, rather - with the shock of encountering other minds. Minds. Plural. One more might have been grasped easily. Another world. Another mind. But to encounter many minds, crowding on each other, each different, overlapping in small space. Unthinkable. The thoughts that permeated Marlene\u0027s mind as Erythro expressed itself could be expressed only distantly and unsatisfactorily in words. Behind those words, overflowing and drowning them, were the emotions, the feelings, the neuronic vibrations that shattered Erythro into a rearrangement of concepts. It had experimented with the minds - felt them. Not felt as human beings would mean \u0027felt\u0027, but something else entirely that could be approached very distantly by that human word and concept. And some of the minds crumpled, decayed, became unpleasant. Erythro ceased to feel minds at random, but sought out minds that would withstand the contact. \u0027And you found me?\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027I found you.\u0027 \u0027But why? Why did you look for me?\u0027 she asked eagerly. The figure wavered and turned smokier. \u0027Just to find you.\u0027 It was no answer. \u0027Why do you want me to be with you?\u0027 The figure started to fade and the thought was a fugitive one. \u0027Just to be with me.\u0027 And it was gone. Only its image was gone. Marlene felt its protection still, its warm enclosure. But why had it disappeared? Had she displeased it with her questions? She heard a sound. On an empty world it is possible to catalogue the sounds briefly, for there aren\u0027t many. There is the noise of flowing water, and the more delicate moan of blowing air. There are the predictable noises you make yourself, whether the falling of a footstep, the rustle of clothing, or the whistle of breath. Marlene heard something that was none of these, and turned in the direction of it. Over the rocky outcropping on her left, there appeared the head of a man. Her first thought, of course, was that it was someone from the Dome who had come to get her, and she felt a surge of anger. Why would they still be searching for her? She would refuse to wear a wave-emitter from now on, and they would then have no way of locating her except by blind search. But she did not recognize the face and surely she had met everyone in the Dome by now. She might not know the individual names or anything about them, but she would know, when she saw anyone from the Dome, that she had seen that face before. She had not seen this new face anywhere in the Dome. Those eyes were staring at her. The mouth was a little open, as if the person were panting. And then whoever it was was topping the rise and running to her. She faced him. The protection she felt around her was strong. She was not afraid. He stopped ten feet away, staring, leaning forward as though he had reached a barrier he could not penetrate, one that deprived him of the ability to advance farther. Finally, he said in a strangled voice, \u0027Roseanne!\u0027 89 Marlene stared at him, observing carefully. His micro-movements were eager and radiated a sense of ownership: possession, closeness, mine, mine, mine. She took a step backward. How was that possible? Why should he- A dim memory of a holoimage she had once seen when she was a little girl- And finally, she could deny it no more. However impossible it sounded, however unimaginable- She huddled within the protective blanket and said, \u0027Father?\u0027 He rushed at her as though he wanted to seize her in his arms and she stepped away again. He paused, swaying, then put one hand to his forehead as though fighting dizziness. He said, \u0027Marlene. I meant to say Marlene.\u0027 He pronounced it incorrectly, Marlene noticed. Two syllables. But that was right for him. How would he know? A second man came up and stood next to him. He had straight black hair, a wide face, narrow eyes, a sallow complexion. Marlene had never seen a man who quite looked like him. She gaped a little and had to make an effort to close her mouth. The second man said to the first in a soft incredulous voice. \u0027Is this your daughter, Fisher?\u0027 Marlene\u0027s eyes widened. Fisher! It was her father. Her father didn\u0027t look at the other man. Only at her. \u0027Yes.\u0027 The other said, even more softly, \u0027First deal of the cards, Fisher? You come here and the first person you meet is your daughter?\u0027 Fisher seemed to make an effort to turn his eyes from his daughter, but he failed. \u0027I think that\u0027s it, Wu. Marlene, your last name is Fisher, isn\u0027t it? Your mother is Eugenia Insigna. Am I right? My name is Crile Fisher and I\u0027m your father.\u0027 He held out his arms to her. Marlene was well aware that the look of yearning on her father\u0027s face was completely real, but she stepped back yet again and said coldly, \u0027How is it you\u0027re here?\u0027 \u0027I came from Earth to find you. To find you. After all these years.\u0027 \u0027Why did you want to find me? You left me when I was a baby.\u0027 \u0027I had to then, but it was always with the intention of coming back for you.\u0027 And another voice - harsh, steely - broke in, and said, \u0027So you came back for Marlene? For nothing else?\u0027 Eugenia Insigna was standing there, face pale, lips almost colorless, hands trembling. Behind her was Siever Genarr, looking astonished, but remaining in the background. Neither one was wearing protective clothing. Insigna said, voice hurried, semihysterical, \u0027I thought there would be people from some Settlement, people from the Solar System. I thought there might be some alien life-form. I went through every possibility I could think of, and in all the thoughts that crowded in on me after I was told a strange ship was landing, I never once thought it might be Crile Fisher coming back. And for Marlene!\u0027 \u0027I came with others on an important mission. This is Chao-Li Wu, a shipmate. And - and-\u0027 \u0027And we meet. Did it ever occur to you that you might encounter me? Or were your thoughts entirely on Marlene? What was your important mission? To find Marlene?\u0027 \u0027No. That was not the mission. Just my desire.\u0027 \u0027And I?\u0027 Fisher\u0027s eyes fell. \u0027I came for Marlene.\u0027 \u0027You came for her? To take her away?\u0027 \u0027I thought-\u0027 began Fisher, and his words stuck. Wu watched him wonderingly. Genarr frowned in thoughtful anger. Insigna whirled toward her daughter. \u0027Marlene, would you go anywhere with this man?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not going anywhere with anyone, Mother,\u0027 said Marlene quietly. Insigna said, \u0027There\u0027s your answer, Crile. You can\u0027t leave me with my child for a year, and come back fifteen years later with a \"By the way, I\u0027ll take her over now.\" And not a thought of me. She\u0027s your daughter biologically, but nothing more. She\u0027s mine by the right of fifteen years of loving and caring.\u0027 Marlene said, \u0027There is no point in quarreling over me, Mother.\u0027 Chao-Li Wu stepped forward. \u0027Pardon me. I have been introduced, but no-one has been introduced to me. You are, madam?\u0027 \u0027Eugenia Insigna Fisher.\u0027 She pointed at Fisher. \u0027His wife - once.\u0027 \u0027And this is your daughter, madam?\u0027 \u0027Yes. This is Marlene Fisher.\u0027 Wu bowed slightly. \u0027And this other gentleman?\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027I\u0027m Siever Genarr, Commander of the Dome that you see behind me on the horizon.\u0027 \u0027Ah good. Commander, I would like to speak to you. I regret that there seems to be a family argument here, but it has nothing to do with our mission.\u0027 \u0027And just what is your mission?\u0027 growled another new voice. Coming toward them was a white-haired figure, his mouth turned down, with something that looked very much like a weapon in his hand. \u0027Hello, Siever,\u0027 he said as he passed Genarr. Genarr looked startled. \u0027Saltade. Why are you here?\u0027 \u0027I am representing Commissioner Janus Pitt of Rotor. I repeat my question to you, sir. What is your mission? And what is your name?\u0027 \u0027My name, at least,\u0027 said Wu, \u0027is easily given. It is Dr Chao-Li Wu. And you, sir?\u0027 \u0027Saltade Levsrett.\u0027 \u0027Greetings. We come in peace,\u0027 said Wu, eyeing the weapon. \u0027I hope so,\u0027 said Leverett grimly. \u0027I have six ships with me and they\u0027ve got your ship in their sights.\u0027 \u0027Indeed?\u0027 said Wu. \u0027This small dome? With a fleet?\u0027 \u0027This small dome is only a tiny outpost,\u0027 said Leverett. \u0027I have the fleet. Do not count on a bluff.\u0027 \u0027I will take your word for it,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027But our one small ship comes from Earth. It got here because it has the capacity for superluminal flight. Do you know what I mean? Faster-than-light travel.\u0027 \u0027I know what you mean.\u0027 Genarr said suddenly, \u0027Is Dr Wu telling the truth, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Yes, he is, Uncle Siever,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027Interesting,\u0027 murmured Genarr. Wu said calmly, \u0027I am delighted to have my word confirmed by this young lady. Am I to suppose she is Rotor\u0027s expert on superluminal flight?\u0027 \u0027You need not suppose anything,\u0027 said Leverett impatiently. \u0027Why are you here? You have not been invited.\u0027 \u0027No, we haven\u0027t. We didn\u0027t know that anyone was here to object to us. But I urge you not to give in, unnecessarily, to any bad temper. At any false move from you, our ship will just disappear into hyperspace.\u0027 Marlene said quickly, \u0027He\u0027s not certain about that.\u0027 Wu frowned. \u0027I\u0027m certain enough. And even if you manage to destroy the ship, our home base on Earth knows where we are and is getting constant reports. If anything happens to us, the next expedition will be one of fifty superluminal battle cruisers. Don\u0027t risk it, sir.\u0027 Marlene said, \u0027That is not so.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027What is not so, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027When he said that the home base on Earth knows where he is, that was not so, and he knew that was not so.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027That\u0027s good enough for me. Saltade, these people do not have hypercommunication.\u0027 Wu\u0027s expression did not change. \u0027Are you relying on the speculation of a teenage girl?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not speculation. It\u0027s a certainty. Saltade, I\u0027ll explain later. Take my word for it.\u0027 Marlene said suddenly, \u0027Ask my father. He\u0027ll tell you.\u0027 She didn\u0027t quite understand how her father would know about her gift - she had surely not had it, or at least had not displayed it, when she was one year old, but his understanding was clear. It shouted itself at her, for all that others could not see it. Fisher said, \u0027It\u0027s no use, Wu. Marlene can see right through us.\u0027 For the first time, Wu\u0027s coolness seemed to desert him. He frowned, and said tartly, \u0027How would you know anything at all about this girl, even if she\u0027s your daughter? You haven\u0027t seen her since she was an infant.\u0027 \u0027I had a younger sister once,\u0027 said Fisher in a low voice. Genarr said with sudden enlightenment, \u0027It runs in the family, then. Interesting. Well, Dr Wu, you see we have a tool here that allows no bluffing. Let us, then, be open with each other. Why have you come to this world?\u0027 \u0027To save the Solar System. Ask the young lady - since she is your absolute authority - if I am telling the truth this time.\u0027 Marlene said, \u0027Of course you\u0027re telling the truth, Dr Wu. We know about the danger. My mother discovered it.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027And we discovered it, too, little lady, without any help from your mother.\u0027 Saltade Leverett looked from one to another and said, \u0027May I ask what you\u0027re all talking about?\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Believe me, Saltade, Janus Pitt knows all about it. I\u0027m sorry he hasn\u0027t told you, but if you get in touch with him now, he will. Tell him we are dealing with people who know how to travel faster than light and that we might be able to make a deal.\u0027 90 The four of them sat in Siever Genarr\u0027s private quarters in the Dome, and Genarr tried to keep his sense of history from overwhelming him. This was the first example in human history of an interstellar negotiation. If each of the four were famous for nothing else, their names would ring down the corridors of Galactic history for this alone. Two and two. There, on the side of the Solar System (Earth, really, and who would have thought that decadent Earth would be representing the Solar System, that they should have developed superluminal flight rather than one of the up-to-date, live-wire Settlements) were Chao-Li Wu and Crile Fisher. Wu was talkative and insinuating; a mathematician, but one who was clearly possessed of practical acumen. Fisher, on the other hand (and Genarr still could not accustom himself to the notion that he was actually seeing him again), sat there quietly, lost in thought and contributing little. On his own side was Saltade Leverett, suspicious and uneasy at being in such close contact with three at once, but firm - lacking the wordy flow of Wu, yet having no trouble in making himself clear. As for Genarr, he was as quiet as Fisher, but he was waiting for them to settle the matter - since he knew something the other three did not. Night had fallen by now, and hours had passed. First lunch, then dinner had been served. There had been breaks to snap the tension and during one of them, Genarr had gone out to see Eugenia Insigna and Marlene. \u0027It\u0027s not going badly,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027Both sides have a great deal to gain.\u0027 \u0027What about Crile?\u0027 asked Insigna nervously. \u0027Has he brought up the matter of Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Honestly, Eugenia, that is not the subject of discussion and he has not brought her up. I do think he is very unhappy about it.\u0027 \u0027He should be,\u0027 said Insigna bitterly. Genarr hesitated. \u0027What do you think, Marlene?\u0027 Marlene looked at him with her dark unfathomable eyes. \u0027I\u0027ve gotten beyond that, Uncle Siever.\u0027 \u0027A little hard-hearted,\u0027 muttered Genarr. But Insigna snapped at him. \u0027Why shouldn\u0027t she be? Deserted in infancy.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not hard-hearted,\u0027 said Marlene thoughtfully. \u0027If I can arrange to have his mind eased, I will. But I don\u0027t belong with him, you see. Or with you, either, Mother. I\u0027m sorry, but I belong with Erythro. Uncle Siever, you will tell me what\u0027s decided, won\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027I promised I would.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s important.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027I should be there to represent Erythro.\u0027 \u0027I imagine that Erythro is there, but you will be part of it before it\u0027s over. Even if I didn\u0027t assure you of that, Marlene, which I do, I think that Erythro would see to it.\u0027 And then he returned to continue the discussion. Chao-Li Wu was leaning back in his seat now, his astute face showing no signs of weariness. \u0027Let me summarize,\u0027 he said. \u0027In the absence of superluminal flight, this Neighbor Star - I shall call it Nemesis, as you do - is the nearest star to the Solar System, so that any ship making its way to the stars would be bound to stop here first. Once all humanity has true superluminal flight, however, distance is no longer a factor and human beings will not search out the nearest star, but the most comfortable star. The search will be on for Sun-like stars that happen to be circled by at least one Earth-like planet. Nemesis will be put to one side. \u0027Rotor, which has, till now, apparently made a fetish of secrecy, to keep others away and to reserve this stellar system for itself, need do so no more. Not only will this system be unwanted by other Settlements, but Rotor itself may no longer want it. It may choose, if it so desires, to search out Sun-like stars for itself. There are billions of such stars in the spiral arms of the Galaxy. \u0027In order for Rotor to have superluminal flight, it might occur to you that you could point a weapon at me and demand all I know. I am a mathematician, a highly theoretical one, and my information is limited. Even if you were to capture our ship itself, you would learn very little from it. What you must do is to send a deputation of scientists and engineers to Earth, where we could train you adequately. \u0027In return, we ask for this world, which you call Erythro. It is my understanding that you do not occupy it in any way except for the presence of this Dome, which is used for astronomical and other kinds of research. You are living in Settlements. \u0027Whereas the Settlements of the Solar System can wander off in search of Sun-like planets, the people of Earth cannot. There are eight billion of us who must be evacuated in a few thousand years and, as Nemesis approaches more and more closely to the Solar System, Erythro will more and more easily serve as a way station on which to place Earthpeople until such time as we can find Earth-like worlds to transfer them to. \u0027We will return to Earth with a Rotorian of your choosing as proof that we were really here. More ships will be built and they will return - you can be sure we will return, for we must have Erythro. We will then take back your scientists, who will learn the technique of superluminal flight, a technique we will also grant to the other Settlements. Does all this adequately summarize what we have decided?\u0027 Leverett said, \u0027It\u0027s not all quite that easy. Erythro will have to be terraformed if it is to support any sizable number of Earthpeople.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I have left out details,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027These will have to be dealt with, too, but not by us.\u0027 \u0027True, Commissioner Pitt and the Council will have to decide on Rotor\u0027s behalf.\u0027 \u0027And the Global Congress on Earth\u0027s behalf, but with so much at stake, I don\u0027t foresee failure.\u0027 \u0027There will have to be safeguards. How far can we trust Earth?\u0027 \u0027About as far as Earth can trust Rotor, I imagine. It may take a year to work out safeguards. Or five years. Or ten years. It will take years, in any case, to build an adequate supply of ships with which to begin, but we have a program that should last several thousand years, one that will end with the necessary abandonment of Earth and the beginning of the colonization of the Galaxy.\u0027 \u0027Assuming there are no competing intelligences to be taken into account,\u0027 growled Leverett. \u0027An assumption we can make until we are forced to abandon it. That is for the future. Will you consult your Commissioner now? Will you choose your Rotorian to accompany us and allow us to leave for Earth as soon as possible?\u0027 Now Fisher leaned forward. \u0027May I suggest that my daughter, Marlene, be the one-\u0027 But Genarr did not allow the sentence to be completed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Crile. I\u0027ve consulted her. She will not leave this world.\u0027 \u0027If her mother goes with her, then-\u0027 \u0027No, Crile. Her mother has nothing to do with it. Even if you wanted Eugenia back, and Eugenia were to decide to go with you, Marlene would still remain on Erythro. And if you decided to stay here to be with her, that would do you no good either. She is lost to you, and to her mother as well.\u0027 Fisher said angrily, \u0027She\u0027s only a child. She can\u0027t make these decisions.\u0027 \u0027Unfortunately for you, and for Eugenia, and for all of us here, and perhaps for all of humanity, she can make these decisions. In fact, I have promised that when we are through here, as I think we now are, that we will acquaint her with our decisions.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Surely that is not necessary.\u0027 Leverett said, \u0027Come, Siever, we don\u0027t have to go to a little girl for permission.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027Please listen to me. It is necessary, and we do have to go to her. Allow me to try an experiment. I am suggesting that Marlene be brought in here so that we can tell her what we have decided. If one of you thinks that is not desirable, let him leave. Let him stand up and leave.\u0027 Leverett said, \u0027I think you\u0027ve taken leave of your senses, Siever. I have no intention of playing games with a teenager. I\u0027m going to speak to Pitt. Where do you keep your transmitter?\u0027 He stood up and, almost at once, staggered and fell. Wu half-rose in alarm, \u0027Mr Leverett-\u0027 Leverett rolled over and held up his arm. \u0027Help me up, somebody.\u0027 Genarr helped him to his feet and back into the chair. \u0027What happened?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 said Leverett. \u0027I had this blinding headache for just a moment.\u0027 \u0027So you were not able to leave the room.\u0027 Genarr turned to Wu. \u0027Since you don\u0027t think seeing Marlene is necessary, would you care to leave the room?\u0027 Very carefully, eyes fixed on Genarr, Wu rose slowly from his chair, winced, and sat down again. He said politely, \u0027Perhaps we had better see the young woman.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027We must. On this world, at least, what that young woman wishes is the law.\u0027 91 \u0027No!\u0027 said Marlene so forcibly that it amounted almost to a shriek. \u0027You can\u0027t do it!\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t do what?\u0027 said Leverett, his white eyebrows drawing close to the furrowed line between. \u0027Use Erythro for a way station - or for anything.\u0027 Leverett stared at her angrily, and his lips drew back as if to speak, but Wu intervened. \u0027Why not, young woman? It is an empty, unused world.\u0027 \u0027It is not empty. It is not unused. Uncle Siever, tell them.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027What Marlene wants to say is that Erythro is occupied by innumerable prokaryote cells capable of photosynthesis. That is why there is oxygen in Erythro\u0027s atmosphere.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027What difference does that make?\u0027 Genarr cleared his throat. \u0027Individually, the cells are as primitive as life can be above the virus level, but, apparently, they cannot be treated individually. Taken all together, they form an organism of enormous complexity. It is world-girdling.\u0027 \u0027An organism?\u0027 Wu remained polite. \u0027A single organism, and Marlene calls it by the name of the planet, since they are so intimately related.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Are you serious? How do you know about this organism?\u0027 \u0027Chiefly through Marlene.\u0027 \u0027Through the young woman,\u0027 said Wu, \u0027who may be - a hysteric?\u0027 Genarr lifted a finger. \u0027Do not say anything seriously against her. I\u0027m not sure that Erythro - the organism - has a sense of humor. We know chiefly through Marlene - not entirely. When Saltade Leverett stood up to leave, he was knocked down. When you half-rose a while ago, perhaps also to leave, you were clearly uncomfortable. Those are the reactions of Erythro. It protects Marlene by acting directly on our minds. In the early days of our existence on this world, it inadvertently caused a small epidemic of mental disease that we called the Erythro Plague. I\u0027m afraid that, if it wishes, it can produce irrecoverable mental damage; and, if it wishes, it can kill. Please do not test this.\u0027 Fisher said, \u0027You mean it is not Marlene who-\u0027 \u0027No, Crile. Marlene has certain abilities, but they don\u0027t extend to the point of doing harm. It is Erythro that is dangerous.\u0027 \u0027How do we stop it from being dangerous?\u0027 asked Fisher. \u0027By listening politely to Marlene, to begin with. Then, too, let me be the one to talk with her. Erythro, at least, knows me. And believe me when I say that I want to save Earth. I have no desire to bring about the death of billions.\u0027 He turned to Marlene. \u0027You understand, Marlene, don\u0027t you, that Earth is in danger? Your mother showed you that the close approach of Nemesis might destroy Earth.\u0027 \u0027I know that, Uncle Siever,\u0027 said Marlene in an agonized voice, \u0027but Erythro belongs to itself.\u0027 \u0027It might want to share, Marlene. It allows the Dome to remain here on the planet. We don\u0027t seem to disturb it.\u0027 \u0027But there are less than a thousand people in the Dome and they stay in the Dome. Erythro doesn\u0027t mind the Dome because that means it can study human minds.\u0027 \u0027It can study human minds all the more when Earth-men come here.\u0027 \u0027Eight billion of them?\u0027 \u0027No, not all eight billion. They\u0027ll come here to settle down temporarily and then go off somewhere. At any one time, there\u0027ll only be a fraction of the population here.\u0027 \u0027It will be millions. I\u0027m sure it will be. You can\u0027t squeeze them all into a dome and supply them with food and water and all they\u0027ll need. You\u0027ll have to spread them out on Erythro and terraform it. Erythro couldn\u0027t survive it. It would have to protect itself.\u0027 \u0027Are you sure of that?\u0027 \u0027It would have to. Wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027It would mean the death of billions.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t help that.\u0027 She pressed her lips together, then said, \u0027There\u0027s a different way.\u0027 Leverett said gruffly, \u0027What\u0027s the girl talking about? What different way?\u0027 Marlene glanced briefly in Leverett\u0027s direction, then turned to Genarr. \u0027I don\u0027t know. Erythro knows. At least - at least it says that the knowledge is here, but it can\u0027t explain.\u0027 Genarr held up both arms to stop what might have been a flurry of questions. \u0027Let me talk.\u0027 Then he said very quietly, \u0027Marlene, be calm. If you\u0027re worried about Erythro, that is useless. You know it can protect itself against anything. Tell me what you mean when you say Erythro can\u0027t explain.\u0027 Marlene was breathless and gasping. \u0027Erythro knows the knowledge is here, but it doesn\u0027t have human experience, human science, human ways of thinking. It doesn\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027The knowledge is in the minds present here?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Uncle Siever.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t it probe the minds?\u0027 \u0027It would hurt them. It can probe my mind without hurting it.\u0027 \u0027I should hope so,\u0027 said Genarr, \u0027but do you have the knowledge?\u0027 \u0027No, of course not. But it can use my mind as a probe for the others here. Yours. My father\u0027s. All.\u0027 \u0027Is that safe?\u0027 \u0027Erythro thinks it is, but - oh, Uncle Siever, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027 \u0027Surely this is madness,\u0027 whispered Wu, and Genarr quickly put a finger to his lips. Fisher was on his feet. \u0027Marlene, you mustn\u0027t-\u0027 Genarr waved him back furiously. \u0027There\u0027s nothing you can do, Crile. There are billions of human beings at risk - we keep on saying it over and over again - and the organism must be allowed to do what it can. Marlene.\u0027 Marlene\u0027s eyes had turned upward. She seemed to be in a trance. \u0027Uncle Siever,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Hold me.\u0027 Half-stumbling, half-falling, she moved toward Genarr, who seized her and held her tightly. \u0027Marlene- Relax- It will be all right-\u0027 He sat down carefully in his chair, still holding her rigid body. 92 It was like a silent explosion of light that obliterated the world. Nothing existed beyond itself. Genarr was not even conscious of being Genarr. The self did not exist either. Only a luminous interconnecting fog of great complexity existed, one that was expanding and separating into threads that took on the same great complexity even as they separated. A whirling and a receding and then an expansion as it approached again. On and on, hypnotically, like something that had always existed and would always exist, without end. Falling endlessly into an opening that widened as it approached without ever getting wider. Continuing change without alteration. Little puffs unfolding into new complexity. On and on. No sound. No sensation. Not even vision. A consciousness of something that had the properties of light without being light. It was the mind becoming aware of itself. And then, painfully - if there had been such a thing as pain in the Universe - and with a sob - if there had been such a thing as a sound in the Universe - it began to dim and turn and spin, faster and faster, into a point of light that flashed and was gone. 93 The Universe was obtrusive in its existence. Wu stretched and said, \u0027Did anyone else experience that?\u0027 Fisher nodded. Leverett said, \u0027Well, I\u0027m a believer. If it\u0027s madness, we\u0027re all mad together.\u0027 But Genarr was still holding Marlene, bending over her painfully. She was breathing raggedly. \u0027Marlene. Marlene.\u0027 Fisher had struggled to his feet. \u0027Is she all right?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t say,\u0027 muttered Genarr. \u0027She\u0027s alive, but that\u0027s not enough.\u0027 Her eyes opened. She was staring at Genarr, her eyes empty, unfocused. \u0027Marlene,\u0027 whispered Genarr in despair. \u0027Uncle Siever,\u0027 whispered Marlene in return. Genarr let himself breathe. At least she had recognized him. \u0027Don\u0027t move,\u0027 he said. \u0027Wait till it\u0027s over.\u0027 \u0027It is over. I\u0027m so glad it\u0027s over.\u0027 \u0027But are you all right?\u0027 She paused, then said, \u0027Yes, I feel all right, Erythro says I\u0027m all right.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Did you find this hidden knowledge we\u0027re supposed to have?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Dr Wu. I did.\u0027 She passed a hand over her damp brow. \u0027It was you, actually, who had it.\u0027 \u0027I?\u0027 said Wu vehemently. \u0027What was it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand it,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027You will, maybe, if I describe it.\u0027 \u0027Describe what?\u0027 \u0027Something that\u0027s gravity pushing things away instead of pulling them toward.\u0027 \u0027Gravitational repulsion, yes,\u0027 said Wu. \u0027It\u0027s part of superluminal flight.\u0027 He drew a deep breath and his body straightened. \u0027It\u0027s a discovery I made.\u0027 \u0027Well then,\u0027 said Marlene, \u0027if you pass close by Nemesis in superluminal flight, there\u0027s gravitational repulsion. The faster you move, the more the repulsion.\u0027 \u0027Yes, the ship would be pushed away.\u0027 \u0027Wouldn\u0027t Nemesis be pushed in the opposite direction?\u0027 \u0027Yes, in inverse ratio of mass, but Nemesis\u0027 move would be immeasurably small.\u0027 \u0027But what if it were repeated over and over for hundreds of years?\u0027 \u0027Nemesis\u0027 movement would still be very small.\u0027 \u0027But its path would be slightly changed and over the light-years the distance would mount up and Nemesis mightpass Earth just far enough away so that Earth would be spared.\u0027 Wu said, \u0027Well-\u0027 Leverett said, \u0027Could something of the sort be worked out?\u0027 \u0027We could try. An asteroid, passing by at ordinary speeds, shifting into hyperspace for a trillionth of a second and back at ordinary speed a million miles out. Asteroids in orbit around Nemesis always moving into hyperspace on thesameside.\u0027 For a moment, he was lost in thought. Then, defensively, \u0027I would surely have thought of this on my own, given a little time.\u0027 Genarr said, \u0027You may still have the credit. Marlene took it from your mind, after all.\u0027 He looked about at the other three and said, \u0027Well, gentlemen, unless something goes terribly wrong, let\u0027s forget about using Erythro as a way station, which it wouldn\u0027t allow anyway. We needn\u0027t concern ourselves with evacuating Earth - if we can learn to make full and proper use of gravitational repulsion. I think the situation has been much improved because we brought in Marlene.\u0027 \u0027Uncle Siever,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027Yes, dear.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m so sleepy.\u0027 94 Tessa Wendel looked at Crile Fisher gravely. \u0027I keep saying to myself: \"You\u0027re back.\" Somehow I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be back, once it was clear you had found the Rotorians.\u0027 \u0027Marlene was the first person - the very first person I found.\u0027 He was staring at nothingness, and Wendel let him. He would have to think it through. They had enough to think about in other directions. They were taking a Rotorian back with them: Ranay D\u0027Aubisson, a neurophysicist. Twenty years before, she had worked in a hospital on Earth. There would be bound to be those who would remember and recognize her. There would be records that would serve to identify her. And she would be the living proof of what they had done. Wu was a changed person, too. He was full of plans for making use of gravitational repulsion to nudge the movement of the Neighbor Star. (He called it Nemesis now, but if he could formulate a plan to move it ever so slightly, it might not be Earth\u0027s nemesis at all.) And Wu had grown modest. He didn\u0027t want the credit for the discovery, which to Wendel seemed completely unbelievable. He said the project had been worked out in conference and he would say no more. What\u0027s more, he was definitely planning to return to the Nemesian System - and not just to run the project. He wanted to be there. \u0027If I have to walk,\u0027 he said. Wendel became aware that Fisher was looking at her, frowning slightly. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you think I\u0027d be back, Tessa?\u0027 She decided to be matter-of-fact. \u0027Your wife is younger than I am, Crile, and she would hold on to your daughter. I was sure of that. And, desperate as you were to have your daughter, I thought-\u0027 \u0027That I would stay with Eugenia because that was the only way?\u0027 \u0027Something like that.\u0027 Fisher shook his head. \u0027It wouldn\u0027t have worked out that way, no matter what. I thought she was Roseanne at first - my sister. The eyes, mostly, but there was a Roseanne look about her in other ways, too. But she was far more than Roseanne. Tessa, she wasn\u0027t human, isn\u0027t human, I\u0027ll explain later. I-\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Never mind, Crile,\u0027 said Wendel. \u0027Explain whenever you please.\u0027 \u0027It hasn\u0027t been a total loss. I\u0027ve seen her. She\u0027s alive. She\u0027s well. And in the end I guess I didn\u0027t want more. Somehow, after my - experience, Marlene became - just Marlene. For the rest of my life, Tessa, you are all I want.\u0027 \u0027Making the best of it, Crile?\u0027 \u0027A very good best it is, Tessa. I\u0027ll be formally divorced. We\u0027ll be formally married. I will leave Rotor and Nemesis to Wu, and you and I can stay on Earth, or on any Settlement you wish. We\u0027ll each have good pensions, and we can leave the Galaxy and its problems to others. We\u0027ve done enough, Tessa. That is, if that\u0027s what you wish, too.\u0027 \u0027I can hardly wait, Crile.\u0027 An hour later, they were still holding each other. 95 Eugenia Insigna said, \u0027I\u0027m so glad I wasn\u0027t there. I keep thinking about it. Poor Marlene. She must have been so afraid.\u0027 \u0027Yes, she was. But she did it, made it possible to save Earth. Even Pitt can do nothing about it now. In a sense, his whole life work has been made useless. Not only is there no purpose to his whole project of secretly building up a new civilization, but he has to help supervise the project for the salvation of the Earth. He has to. Rotor is no longer hidden. It can be reached at any time, and every bit of humanity, on and off Earth, will turn against us if we don\u0027t rejoin the human race. It couldn\u0027t have happened without Marlene.\u0027 Insigna wasn\u0027t thinking of the greater significances. She said, \u0027But when she was frightened, really frightened, it was to you she turned, not to Crile.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027And you held her, not Crile.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but Eugenia, don\u0027t make anything mystical out of it. She knew me, but she didn\u0027t know Crile.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re bound to explain it very sensibly, Siever. That\u0027s you. But I\u0027m glad it was you she turned to. He didn\u0027t deserve her.\u0027 \u0027Fair enough. He didn\u0027t deserve her. But, now - please, Eugenia, let go. Crile is leaving. He\u0027ll never be back. He\u0027s seen his daughter. He\u0027s watched her provide a way to save Earth. I don\u0027t begrudge him that, and you shouldn\u0027t either. So, if you don\u0027t mind, I am changing the subject. Do you know that Ranay D\u0027Aubisson is leaving with them?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Everyone is talking about it. I won\u0027t miss her somehow. I never thought she was very sympathetic to Marlene.\u0027 \u0027Neither were you at times, Eugenia. It\u0027s a great thing for Ranay. Once she realized the so-called Erythro Plague was not a useful field of study, her work here was shattered, but on Earth, she can introduce modern brain scanning and have a great professional life.\u0027 \u0027All right. Good for her.\u0027 \u0027But Wu will be back. Very bright man. It was his brain that yielded the proper finding. You know, I\u0027m sure that when he comes back to work on the Repulsion Effect, his real desire will be to remain on Erythro. The Erythro organism has picked him as it had picked Marlene. And what\u0027s funnier still, I think it\u0027s picked Leverett, as well.\u0027 \u0027What system do you suppose it uses, Siever?\u0027 \u0027Do you mean why does it take Wu and not Crile? Why does it take Leverett and not me?\u0027 \u0027Well, I can see that Wu must be a far more brilliant man than Crile, but, Siever, you are much better than Leverett. Not that I would have wanted to lose you.\u0027 \u0027Thank you. I presume the Erythro organism has a criterion of its own. I even think I have a dim idea of what it might be.\u0027 \u0027Really?\u0027 \u0027Yes. When my mind was being probed, it meant that through Marlene, the Erythro organism itself was entering us. I caught a glimpse of its thoughts, I imagine. Not consciously, of course, but when it was over I seemed to know things I didn\u0027t know before. Marlene has the strange talent that makes it possible for her to communicate with the organism and makes it also possible for it to use her brain as a probe for other brains, but I think that\u0027s just a practical advantage. It chose her for something far more unusual.\u0027 \u0027What would that be?\u0027 \u0027Imagine you\u0027re a piece of string, Eugenia. How would you feel if you suddenly and unexpectedly became aware of a piece of lace? Imagine you\u0027re a circle. How would you feel if you came across a patterned sphere? Erythro had knowledge of only one kind of mind - its own. Its mind is immensely huge, but so pedestrian. It is what it is only because it is made up of trillions of trillions of cellular units, all very loosely connected. \u0027Then it came across human minds, in which the cellular units were comparatively few, but in which there were incredible numbers of interconnections - incredible complexity. Lace instead of string. It must have been overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of it. It must have found Marlene\u0027s mind to be the most beautiful of all. That was why it seized upon her. Wouldn\u0027t you - if you had a chance to acquire a real Rembrandt or a Van Gogh? That was why it protected her so avidly. Wouldn\u0027t you protect a great work of art? Yet it risked her for the sake of humanity. It was rough on Marlene, but rather noble of the organism. \u0027Anyway, that is what I consider the Erythro organism to be. I consider it an art connoisseur, a collector of beautiful minds.\u0027 Insigna laughed. \u0027By that token, Wu and Leverett must have very beautiful minds.\u0027 \u0027They probably do to Erythro. And it will continue collecting when scientists from Earth arrive. You know it will end by collecting a group of human beings different from the common run. The Erythro group. It may help them find new homes in space and, in the end, perhaps the Galaxy will have two kinds of worlds, worlds of Earthmen and worlds of more efficient pioneers, the true Spacers. I wonder how that would work out. Surely it would mean the future would lie with them. I regret that somehow.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t think of that,\u0027 said Insigna urgently. \u0027Let people of the future deal with the future as it comes. Right now, you and I are human beings judging each other by human standards.\u0027 Genarr smiled joyously, his pleasantly homely face lighting up. \u0027I\u0027m glad of that, because I find your mind beautiful, and perhaps you find mine equally beautiful.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Siever, I always did. Always.\u0027 Genarr\u0027s smile faded somewhat. \u0027But there are other kinds of beauty, I know.\u0027 \u0027Not for me any longer. You have all the kinds of beauty. Siever, we lost the morning, you and I. But there\u0027s still the afternoon.\u0027 \u0027In that case, what more can I possibly want, Eugenia? The morning is well lost - if we can share the afternoon.\u0027 Their hands touched.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-37.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies. One of the colonies, Rotor, has broken away from the solar system to create its own renegade utopia around an unknown red star two light-years from Earth: a star named Nemesis. Now a fifteen-year-old Rotorian girl has learned of the dire threat that nemesis poses to Earth\u0027s people--but she is prevented from warning them. Soon she will realize that Nemesis endangers Rotor as well.
