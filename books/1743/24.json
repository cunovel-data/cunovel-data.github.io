{"id":70505,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"49 Long-distance travel through a planetary atmosphere was not something that Settlers accepted as part of their society. On a Settlement, distances were small enough so that elevators, legs, and an occasional electric cart were all that was necessary. As for inter-Settlement travel, that was by rocket. Many Settlers - at least, back in the Solar System - had been in space so many times that progress through it was almost as common to them as walking. It was a rare Settler, however, who had traveled to Earth, where alone atmospheric travel existed, and which had made use of airflight. Settlers who could face the vacuum as though it were a friend and brother felt unfathomable terror if expected to sense, somehow, the whistle of air past a vehicle without ground-support below. Yet air travel, on occasion, was an obvious necessity on Erythro. Like Earth it was a large world, and like Earth it had a fairly dense (and breathable) atmosphere. There were reference books on airflight available on Rotor, and even several Earth immigrants with aeronautical experience. So the Dome owned two small aircraft, somewhat clumsy, somewhat primitive, ungiven to large bursts of speed, or to headlong maneuverability - but serviceable. In fact, Rotor\u0027s very ignorance of aeronautical engineering helped in one respect. The Dome\u0027s aircraft were far more computerized than any corresponding vessel on Earth. In fact, Siever Genarr liked to think of the vessels as intricate robots that happened to be built in the shape of aircraft. Erythro\u0027s weather was much milder than Earth\u0027s could possibly be, since the low intensity of the radiation from Nemesis was insufficient to power large and violent storms, so that an aircraft-robot was less likely to have to face an emergency. Far less likely. As a result, virtually anyone could fly the raw and unpolished aircraft of the Dome. You simply told the plane what you wanted it to do and it was done. If the message was unclear, or seemed dangerous to the robotic brain of the vessel, it asked for clarification. Genarr watched Marlene climb into the cabin of the plane with a certain natural concern, if not with the lip-biting terror of Eugenia Insigna, who stood well away from the scene. (\u0027Don\u0027t come any closer,\u0027 he had ordered Insigna sternly, \u0027especially if you\u0027re going to look as though you were witnessing the sure beginning of calamity. You\u0027ll panic the girl.\u0027) It seemed to Insigna that there were grounds for panic. Marlene was too young to remember a world where air-flight was common. She had taken a rocket calmly enough to come to Erythro, but how would she react to this unheard of flight through air? And yet Marlene climbed into the cabin and took her seat with a look of utter calm on her face. Was it possible she did not grasp the situation? Genarr said, \u0027Marlene, dear, you do know what we\u0027re going to be doing, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Uncle Siever. You\u0027re going to show me Erythro.\u0027 \u0027From the air, you know. You\u0027ll be flying through the air.\u0027 \u0027Yes. You said so before.\u0027 \u0027Does the thought of it bother you?\u0027 \u0027No, Uncle Siever, but it\u0027s bothering you a lot.\u0027 \u0027Only on your behalf, dear.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll be perfectly all right.\u0027 She turned her calm face toward him as he climbed in after her and took his seat. She said, \u0027I can understand Mother being concerned, but you\u0027re more concerned than she is. You\u0027re managing to show it less in any big way, but if you could see yourself licking your lips, you would be embarrassed. You feel that if something bad happens, it will be your fault, and you just can\u0027t stand the thought. Just the same, nothing\u0027s going to happen.\u0027 \u0027Are you sure of that, Marlene?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely sure. Nothing will harm me on Erythro.\u0027 \u0027You said that about the Plague, but we\u0027re not talking about that now.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what we\u0027re talking about. Nothing will harm me on Erythro.\u0027 Genarr shook his head slightly in disbelief and uncertainty, and then wished he hadn\u0027t, for he knew she read that as easily as though it were appearing in the largest block letters on the computer screen. But what was the difference? If he had repressed it all and had acted as if he were made of cast bronze, she would still have seen it. He said, \u0027We\u0027ll go into an airlock and stay there just a while, so that I can check the responsiveness of the vessel\u0027s brain. Then we will go through another door and the plane will then move up in the air. There\u0027ll be an acceleration effect, and you\u0027ll be pressed backward, and we\u0027ll be moving in the air, with nothing beneath us. You understand that, I hope?\u0027 \u0027I am not afraid,\u0027 said Marlene quietly. 50 The aircraft remained on its steady course across a barren landscape of rolling hills. Genarr knew that Erythro was geologically alive and knew also that what geological studies had been made of the world indicated that there had been periods in its history when it had been mountainous. And there were still mountains here and there on the cis-Megan hemisphere, the hemisphere in which the bloated circle of the planet Megas, around which Erythro orbited, hung almost motionless in the sky. Here on the trans-Megan side, however, plains and hills were the chief feature of the two large continents. To Marlene, who had never seen a mountain in her life, even the low hills were exciting. There were rivulets on Rotor, of course, and from the height at which they were viewing Erythro, these rivers looked no different. Genarr thought: Marlene will be surprised when she sees them at a closer view. Marlene look curiously at Nemesis, which had passed its noonmark and had declined toward the west. She said, \u0027It\u0027s not moving, is it, Uncle Siever?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s moving,\u0027 said Genarr. \u0027Or, at least Erythro is turning relative to Nemesis, but it turns only once a day, while Rotor turns once every two minutes. In comparison, Nemesis, as seen from here on Erythro, is moving less than 1/700th as fast as it seems to be moving as seen from Rotor. It seems to be standing still here, by comparison, but it isn\u0027t standing entirely still.\u0027 Then, casting a quick glance at Nemesis, he said, \u0027You\u0027ve never seen Earth\u0027s Sun, the Sun of the Solar System, you know; or, if you have, you don\u0027t remember it, having been a baby at the time. The Sun was much smaller as seen from Rotor\u0027s position in the Solar System.\u0027 \u0027Smaller?\u0027 said Marlene in surprise. \u0027The computer told me that it was Nemesis that was smaller.\u0027 \u0027In reality, yes. Still, Rotor is so much closer to Nemesis than it ever was to the Sun in the old days that Nemesis seems larger.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re four million kilometers from Nemesis, aren\u0027t we?\u0027 \u0027But we were a hundred fifty million kilometers from the Sun. If we were that far from Nemesis, we\u0027d get less than 1 per cent of the light and warmth we get now. If we were as close to the Sun as we are to Nemesis, we\u0027d be vaporized. The Sun is much larger, brighter and hotter than Nemesis.\u0027 Marlene wasn\u0027t looking at Genarr, but apparently his tone of voice was sufficient. \u0027From the way you talk, Uncle Siever, I think you wish you were back near the Sun.\u0027 \u0027I was born there, so I get homesick sometimes.\u0027 \u0027But the Sun is so hot and bright. It must be dangerous.\u0027 \u0027We didn\u0027t look at it. And you shouldn\u0027t look at Nemesis too long either. Look away, dear.\u0027 Genarr cast another quick glance at Nemesis, however. It hung in the western sky, red and vast, its apparent diameter at four degrees of arc, or eight times that of the Sun as seen from Rotor\u0027s old position. It was a quiet red circle of light, but Genarr knew that, on comparatively rare occasions, it would flare and, for a few minutes, there would be a white spot on that serene face that would be painful to look at. Mild sunspots, in darker red, were more common, but not as noticeable. He murmured an order to the plane, which veered sufficiently to put Nemesis farther to the rear, out of direct view. Marlene took a last, thoughtful glance at Nemesis, then turned her eyes to Erythro\u0027s vista stretched out below. She said, \u0027You get used to the pink color of everything. It doesn\u0027t look so pink after a while.\u0027 Genarr had noticed that himself. His eyes caught differences in tint and shade so that the world began to seem less monochromatic. The rivers and small lakes were ruddier and darker than the land surface, and the sky was dark. Little of the red light of Nemesis was scattered by Erythro\u0027s atmosphere. The most hopeless thing about Erythro, however, was the barrenness of the land. Rotor, even on its tiny scale, had green fields, yellow grain, varicolored fruit, noise-making animals, all the color and sound of human habitation and structures. Here there was only silence and inanimation. Marlene frowned. \u0027There is life on Erythro, Uncle Siever.\u0027 Genarr couldn\u0027t tell whether Marlene was making a statement, asking a question, or answering his thought as revealed by his body language. Was she insisting on something or seeking reassurance? He said, \u0027Certainly. Lots of life. It\u0027s all-pervasive. It\u0027s not only in the water either. There are prokaryotes living in the water films about the soil particles, too.\u0027 After a while, the ocean made its appearance on the horizon ahead, first as simply a dark line, then a thickening band as the air vehicle approached it. Genarr cast careful sidelong glances at Marlene, watching her reaction. She had read about Earth\u0027s oceans, of course, and must have seen images on holovision, but nothing can prepare anyone for the actual experience. Genarr, who had been on Earth once (once!) as a tourist, had seen the edge of an ocean. He had never been over one, out of sight of land, however, and he wasn\u0027t sure of his own reactions. It rolled back below them and now the dry land shrank behind into a lighter line and, eventually, it was gone. Genarr looked down with a queer feeling in the pit of his stomach. He remembered a phrase from an archaic epic: \u0027the wine-dark sea\u0027. Below them the ocean certainly did look like a vast rolling mass of red wine, with pink froth here and there. There were no markings to identify in that vast body of water, and there was no place to land. The very essence of \u0027location\u0027 was gone. Yet he knew that when he wanted to return, he need do no more than direct the plane to take them back to land. The plane\u0027s computer kept track of position in accurate reckoning of speed and direction and would know where land was - even where the Dome was. They passed under a thick cloud deck and the ocean turned black. A word from Genarr, and the plane lifted through and above the clouds. Nemesis shone again, and the ocean could no longer be seen beneath them. There was, instead, a sea of pink water droplets, billowing and rising here and there, so that bits of fog moved, occasionally, past the window. Then the clouds seemed to part and between their edges, glimpses of the wine-dark sea could again be seen. Marlene watched, her mouth partly open, her breath shallow. She said in a whisper, \u0027That\u0027s all water, isn\u0027t it, Uncle Siever?\u0027 \u0027Thousands of kilometers in every direction, Marlene - and ten kilometers deep in spots.\u0027 \u0027If you fall into it, I suppose you drown.\u0027 \u0027You needn\u0027t worry about that. This vehicle won\u0027t fall into the ocean.\u0027 \u0027I know it won\u0027t,\u0027 said Marlene matter-of-factly. There was another sight, Genarr thought, to which Marlene could well be introduced. Marlene broke in on his thought. \u0027You\u0027re getting nervous again, Uncle Siever.\u0027 Genarr felt amused at the manner in which he was learning to take Marlene\u0027s penetration for granted. He said, \u0027You\u0027ve never seen Megas, and I was wondering if I ought to show it to you. You see, only one side of Erythro faces Megas, and the Dome was built on the side of Erythro that doesn\u0027t face it, so that Megas is never in our sky. If we continue to fly in this direction, however, we\u0027ll enter the cis-Megan hemisphere and we\u0027ll see it rise above the horizon.\u0027 \u0027I would like to see that.\u0027 \u0027You will, then, but be prepared. It\u0027s large. Really large. Nearly twice as wide as Nemesis and it looks almost like it\u0027s about to fall on us. Some people simply can\u0027t endure the sight. It won\u0027t fall, though. It can\u0027t. Try to remember that.\u0027 They moved along at a higher altitude and a heightened speed. The ocean lay below in wrinkled sameness, occasionally obscured by clouds. Eventually, Genarr said, \u0027If you\u0027ll look ahead and a little to the right, you\u0027ll see Megas beginning to show at the horizon. We\u0027ll turn toward it.\u0027 It looked like a small patch of light along the horizon at first, but grew like a slow upward swell. Then the widening arc of a deep red circle lifted itself above the horizon. It was distinctly deeper than Nemesis, which could still be seen to the right and in back of the plane, and somewhat lower in the sky. As Megas loomed larger, it soon became apparent that what was being revealed was not a full circle of light, a bit more than a semicircle. Marlene said with interest, \u0027Now that\u0027s what they mean by \"phases,\" isn\u0027t that right?\u0027 \u0027Exactly right. We only see the part that\u0027s lit by Nemesis. As Erythro goes around Megas, Nemesis seems to move closer to Megas and we see less and less of the lit half of the planet. Then when Nemesis skims just above or below Megas, we just see a thin curve of light at Megas\u0027 boundary; that\u0027s all we see of its lighted hemisphere. Sometimes Nemesis actually moves behind Megas. Nemesis is then eclipsed, and all the dim stars of night come out, not just the bright ones that show even when Nemesis is in the sky. During the eclipse, you can see a large circle of darkness with no stars in it at all, and that shows you where Megas is. When Nemesis reappears on the other side, you begin to see a thin curve of light again.\u0027 \u0027How marvelous,\u0027 said Marlene. \u0027It\u0027s like a show in the sky. And look at Megas - all those moving stripes.\u0027 They stretched across the lighted portion of the globe, thick and reddish brown, interspersed with orange, and slowly writhing. \u0027They\u0027re storm bands,\u0027 said Genarr, \u0027with terrific winds that blow this way and that. If you watch closely, you\u0027ll see spots form and expand, drift along, then spread out and vanish.\u0027 \u0027It is like a holovision show,\u0027 said Marlene raptly. \u0027Why don\u0027t people watch it all the time?\u0027 \u0027Astronomers do. They watch it through computerized instruments located on this hemisphere. I\u0027ve seen it myself in our Observatory. You know, we had a planet like this back in the Solar System. It\u0027s called Jupiter, and it\u0027s even larger than Megas.\u0027 By now, the planet had lifted entirely above the horizon, looking like a bloated balloon that had, somehow, partially collapsed along its left half. Marlene said, \u0027It\u0027s lovely. If the Dome were built on this side of Erythro, everyone could watch it.\u0027 \u0027Actually not, Marlene. It doesn\u0027t seem to work that way. Most people don\u0027t like Megas. I told you that some I people get the impression that Megas is falling and it frightens them.\u0027 Marlene said impatiently, \u0027Only a few people would have such a silly notion.\u0027 \u0027Only a few to begin with, but silly notions can be contagious. Fears spread, and some people who wouldn\u0027t be afraid if left to themselves, become afraid because their neighbor is. Haven\u0027t you ever noticed that sort of thing?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I have,\u0027 she said with a touch of bitterness. \u0027If one boy thinks a bimbo is pretty, they all do. They start competing-\u0027 She paused, as if in embarrassment. \u0027The contagious fear is one reason we built the Dome on the other hemisphere. Another is that with Megas always in the sky, astronomic observations are more difficult to make in this hemisphere. But I think it\u0027s time we begin our return. You know your mother. She\u0027ll be in a panic.\u0027 \u0027Call her and tell her we\u0027re all right.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have to. This ship is sending out signals continuously. She knows we\u0027re all right - physically. But that\u0027s not what she\u0027s worried about,\u0027 he said, tapping his temple significantly. Marlene slumped in her chair and a look of deep discontent crossed her face. \u0027What a pain. I know everyone will say, \"It\u0027s just because she loves you,\" but it\u0027s such a bother. Why can\u0027t she just take my word for it that I\u0027ll be all right?\u0027 \u0027Because she loves you,\u0027 said Genarr, as he quietly instructed the aircraft to return home, \u0027just as you love Erythro.\u0027 Marlene\u0027s face brightened at once. \u0027Oh, I do.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes. It\u0027s quite visible in your every reaction to the world.\u0027 And Genarr wondered how Eugenia Insigna would react to that. 51 She reacted in fury. \u0027What do you mean, she loves Erythro? How can she love a dead world? Is it possible you brainwashed her? Is there some reason you\u0027ve talked her into loving it?\u0027 \u0027Eugenia, be reasonable. Do you really believe it is possible to brainwash Marlene into anything? Have you ever succeeded in doing so?\u0027 \u0027Then what happened?\u0027 \u0027Actually, I tried to subject her to situations that would displease or frighten her. If anything, I tried to \"brainwash\" her into disliking Erythro. I know from experience that Rotorians, brought up in the tight little world of a Settlement, hate the endlessness of Erythro; they don\u0027t like the redness of the light; they don\u0027t like that enormous puddle of an ocean; they don\u0027t like darkening clouds; they don\u0027t like Nemesis; and, most of all, they don\u0027t like Megas. All these things tend to depress and frighten them. And I showed all these things to Marlene. I took her out over the ocean and then, far enough out to show her Megas entirely above the horizon.\u0027 \u0027And?\u0027 \u0027And nothing bothered her. She said she got used to the red light, and it stopped looking so terribly red. The ocean didn\u0027t in the least frighten her, and, most of all, she found Megas interesting and amusing.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t believe it.\u0027 \u0027You must. It\u0027s true.\u0027 Insigna sank into thought, then said reluctantly, \u0027Maybe it\u0027s a sign that she\u0027s already infected with the - the-\u0027 \u0027With the Plague. I arranged for another brain scan as soon as we got back. We still haven\u0027t got the complete analysis, but the preliminary inspection shows no change. The mind pattern changes markedly and noticeably even in a light case of the Plague. Marlene simply doesn\u0027t have it. However, an interesting thought just occurred to me. We know that Marlene is perceptive, that she can note all sorts of little things. Feelings flow from others to her. But have you ever detected anything that might seem the reverse? Do feelings flow from her to others?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re getting at.\u0027 \u0027She knows when I\u0027m uncertain and a little anxious, no matter how I try to hide the fact, or that I\u0027m calm and unafraid. Is there any way, though, that she can force me or encourage me to become uncertain and a little anxious - or calm and unafraid? If she detects, can she also impose?\u0027 Insigna stared at him. \u0027I think that\u0027s crazy!\u0027 she said, her voice choked in disbelief. \u0027Perhaps. But have you ever noticed that sort of effect with Marlene? Think about it.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have to think. I\u0027ve never noticed any such thing.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 muttered Genarr, \u0027I suppose you haven\u0027t. She would certainly love to make you feel less nervous about herself, and she certainly fails to bring that about. However- It is true, though, if we just cling to Marlene\u0027s perceptive ability, that it has strengthened since she has arrived on Erythro. Agreed?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Agreed.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s more than that. She\u0027s now strongly intuitive. She knows that she is immune to the Plague. She is certain that nothing on Erythro will harm her. She stared down at the ocean in convinced knowledge that the aircraft wouldn\u0027t drop into it and drown her. Has she had this kind of attitude back on Rotor? Hasn\u0027t she felt uncertain and insecure on Rotor when there was reason to feel so, just as any other youngster might?\u0027 \u0027Yes! Certainly.\u0027 \u0027But here she\u0027s a new girl. Totally sure of herself. Why?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why.\u0027 \u0027Is Erythro affecting her? No, no, I mean nothing like the Plague. Is there some other effect? Something completely different? I\u0027ll tell you why I ask. I felt it myself.\u0027 \u0027Felt what yourself?\u0027 \u0027A certain optimism about Erythro. I didn\u0027t mind the desolation, or anything else. It\u0027s not that I was desperately put off by it before, that Erythro made me seriously uneasy, but I never liked the planet. On this trip with Marlene, however, I came nearer to liking it than ever before in my ten years of residence here. It was possible, I thought, that Marlene\u0027s delight was contagious, or that she might somehow be forcing it on me. Or else whatever it is about Erythro that is affecting her may be affecting me, too - in her presence.\u0027 Insigna said sarcastically, \u0027I think, Siever, that you had better have a brain scan yourself.\u0027 Genarr raised his eyebrows. \u0027Do you think I haven\u0027t? I\u0027ve undergone a check periodically ever since I\u0027ve been here. There\u0027ve been no changes except those inseparable from the aging process.\u0027 \u0027But have you checked your mind pattern since getting back from the plane trip?\u0027 \u0027Of course. First thing. I\u0027m no fool. The complete analysis isn\u0027t back yet, but the preliminary work shows no change.\u0027 \u0027Then what are you going to do next?\u0027 \u0027The logical thing. Marlene and I are going out of the Dome, and out upon Erythro\u0027s surface.\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll take precautions. I\u0027ve been out there before.\u0027 \u0027You, perhaps,\u0027 said Insigna stubbornly. \u0027Not she. Never she.\u0027 Genarr sighed. He whirled in his chair, looking at the false window in the wall of his office as though he were trying to penetrate it and look out upon the redness beyond. Then he looked back at Insigna. \u0027Out there is a huge brand-new world,\u0027 he said, \u0027one that belongs to no-one and nothing except ourselves. We can take that world and develop it with all the lessons we\u0027ve learned from our foolish mismanagement of our original world. We can build a good world this time, a clean world, a decent world. We can get used to the redness. We can bring it to life with our own plants and animals. We can make sea and land flourish and start the planet on its own course of evolution.\u0027 \u0027And the Plague? What of that?\u0027 \u0027We might eliminate the Plague, and make Erythro ideal for us.\u0027 \u0027If we eliminate the heat and the gravity, and alter the chemical composition, we can make Megas ideal for us, too.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Eugenia, but you must admit that the Plague is in a different category from heat, gravity and global chemistry.\u0027 \u0027But the Plague is just as deadly in its own way.\u0027 \u0027Eugenia, I think I\u0027ve told you that Marlene is the most important person we have.\u0027 \u0027She certainly is to me.\u0027 \u0027To you, she\u0027s important simply because she is your daughter. To the rest of us, she is important for what she can do.\u0027 \u0027What can she do? Interpret our body language? Play tricks?\u0027 \u0027She is convinced she is immune to the Plague. If she is, that might teach us-\u0027 \u0027If she is. It\u0027s childish fantasy and you know it. Don\u0027t grasp at cobwebs.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a world out there, and I want it.\u0027 \u0027You sound like Pitt after all. For that world, will you risk my daughter?\u0027 \u0027In human history, much more has been risked for much less.\u0027 \u0027More shame to human history. And in any case, it\u0027s up to me to decide. She\u0027s my daughter.\u0027 And Genarr said in a low voice that seemed to contain infinite sorrow, \u0027I love you, Eugenia, but I lost you once. I have had this feeble dream of perhaps trying to undo that loss. But now I\u0027m afraid I must lose you again, and permanently. Because, you see, I\u0027m going to tell you that it\u0027s not up to you to decide. It is not even up to me to decide. It is up to Marlene. Whatever she decides, she will do, somehow. And because she may well have the ability to win humanity a world, I am going to help her do what she wants to do, despite you. Please, you must accept that, Eugenia.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-24.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
