And yet, even in these rare moments, doubts crept in. He wondered whether Rotor would not have been better off if he had clung to that original resolve of his - if they had not remained in orbit about Erythro, and if the Dome on Erythro had never been built.\\n\\n He was leaning back in his soft chair, the restraining fields cushioning him, the aura of peace lulling him almost into sleep, when he heard the soft buzz that drew him back, reluctantly, into reality.\\n\\n He opened his eyes (he had not realized they were closed) to look at the small viewpatch on the opposite wall. A touch of a contact magnified it into holovision.\\n\\n It was Semyon Akorat, of course.\\n\\n There he was with his bald bullethead. (Akorat shaved off the dark fringe that would otherwise show, feeling, quite rightly, that a few fugitive hairs would but make the desert in the center look the more pathetic, whereas a shapely skull, unmarred by interruption, could look almost stately.) There he was, also, with his worried eyes, which always looked worried even when there was no cause for worry.\\n\\n Pitt found him unpleasant, not because of any failure in loyalty or efficiency (he could not be improved on, either way) but simply because of conditioned response. Akorat always announced an invasion of Pitt\u0027s privacy, an interruption of his thoughts, a necessity for doing what he would rather not do. In short, Akorat was in charge of Pitt\u0027s appointments and said who could see him and who could not.\\n\\n Pitt frowned slightly. He could not recall that he had an appointment, but he often forgot and relied on Akorat not to.\\n\\n \u0027Who is it?\u0027 he said resignedly. \u0027No-one important, I hope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No-one at all of any real significance,\u0027 said Akorat, \u0027but perhaps you had better see her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is she within earshot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Commissioner,\u0027 said Akorat reproachfully, as though he were being accused of dereliction of duty. \u0027Of course not. She is on the other side of the screen.\u0027 He had an enormous precision of speech, which Pitt found soothing. There was never any question of mistaking his words.\\n\\n Pitt said, \u0027She? I presume it Dr Insigna, then. Well, stick to my instructions. Not without an appointment. I\u0027ve had enough of her for a while, Akorat. Enough of her for the last twelve years, in fact. Make up an excuse. Say I\u0027m in meditation - no, she won\u0027t believe that - say-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Commissioner, it\u0027s not Dr Insigna. I would not have disturbed you if it were. It\u0027s - it\u0027s her daughter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Her daughter?\u0027 For a moment, he fumbled over her name. \u0027You mean Marlene Fisher?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Naturally, I told her you were busy, and she said that I ought to be ashamed of myself for telling a lie, for my expression showed it was a lie, up and down, and that my voice was too tense to be telling the truth.\u0027 He recited this with baritone indignation. \u0027In any case, she won\u0027t leave. She insists you will see her if you know she is waiting. Would you see her, Commissioner? Those eyes of hers rattle me, frankly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It seems to me I\u0027ve heard of her eyes, too. Well, send her in, send her in, and I\u0027ll try to survive her eyes. Come to think of it, she has some explaining to do.\u0027\\n\\n She entered. (Remarkably self-possessed, Pitt thought, though properly demure and with no sign of defiance.)\\n\\n She sat down, her hands loosely in her lap, and clearly waited for Pitt to speak first. He let her wait a little, while he considered her in a rather absent fashion. He had seen her occasionally when she was younger, but not for a while, now. She had not been a pretty child and she wasn\u0027t any prettier now. She had broad cheekbones, and a certain gracelessness about her, but she did have remarkable eyes, and shapely eyebrows and long eyelashes, too.\\n\\n Pitt said, \u0027Well, Miss Fisher, I\u0027m told you wanted to see me. May I ask why?\u0027\\n\\n Marlene looked up at him, her eyes cool, and seemed entirely at ease. She said, \u0027Commissioner Pitt, I think my mother must have told you that I told a friend of mine that the Earth was going to be destroyed.\u0027\\n\\n Pitt\u0027s eyebrows hunched down over his own rather ordinary eyes. He said, \u0027Yes, she did. And I hope she told you that you must not speak of such matters in so foolish a way again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, she did, Commissioner, but not speaking about it doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t so; and calling it foolish doesn\u0027t make it so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am Commissioner of Rotor, Miss Fisher, and it is my function to concern myself with such matters, and therefore you must leave it entirely to me, whether it is so or not so, whether it is foolish or not foolish. How did you get the idea that the Earth was going to be destroyed? Is this something your mother told you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not directly, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But indirectly. Is that it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She couldn\u0027t help that, Commissioner. Everyone speaks in all sorts of ways. There\u0027s the choice of words. There\u0027s intonation, expression, the flicker of eyes and eyelids, little tricks of clearing the throat. A hundred things. Do you know what I mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know exactly what you mean. I watch for those things myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you feel very proud of that, Commissioner. You feel you\u0027re very good at it and that that\u0027s one of the reasons you\u0027re Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n Pitt looked startled. \u0027I didn\u0027t say that, young woman.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not in words, Commissioner. You didn\u0027t have to.\u0027 Her eyes were fixed on his. There was no trace of a smile on her face, but her eyes seemed amused.\\n\\n \u0027Well then, Miss Fisher, is that what you came to tell me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Commissioner. I came because my mother has found it difficult to see you recently. No, she didn\u0027t tell me so. I just gathered it. I thought you might see me, instead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, you\u0027re here. Now what is it you came to tell me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My mother is unhappy about the chance that Earth may be destroyed. My father\u0027s there, you know.\u0027\\n\\n Pitt felt a small spasm of anger. How could a purely personal matter be allowed to interfere with the welfare of Rotor and all that it might become in the future? This Insigna, for all her usefulness in having found Nemesis in the first place, had long been an albatross about his neck with her unfailing way of heading down every wrong path. And now, when he would see her no more, she sent her mad daughter.\\n\\n He said, \u0027Are you under the impression that this destruction you speak of will happen tomorrow, or next year?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Commissioner, I know that it will happen in just a little bit less than five thousand years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If that is the case, your father will be long gone by then, as will your mother, and I, and you. And when we\u0027re all gone, it will still be nearly five thousand years before destruction for Earth and possibly other planets of the Solar System - if that destruction happens at all, which it won\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the idea of it, Commissioner, whenever it happens.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your mother must have told you that long before the time comes, the people of the Solar System will be aware of - of whatever you think will happen, and will deal with it. Besides, how can we complain of planetary destruction? Every world faces it eventually. Even if there are no cosmic collisions, every star must pass through a red giant stage and destroy its planets. Just as all human beings will die someday, so will all planets. Planetary lifetimes are a little longer, but that\u0027s all. Do you understand all that, young lady?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 said Marlene seriously. \u0027I have a good relationship with my computer.\u0027\\n\\n (I\u0027ll bet she does, thought Pitt, and then - too late - tried to wipe out the small sardonic smile that had twitched into existence on his face. She had probably used it to understand his attitude.)\\n\\n He said with a note of finality, \u0027Then we come to the end of our conversation. The talk of destruction is foolish, and even if it weren\u0027t, it has nothing to do with you, and you must never speak of it again, or not only you, but your mother as well, will be in trouble.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not at the end of our conversation yet, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n Pitt felt himself losing patience, but he said, quite calmly, \u0027My dear Miss Fisher, when your Commissioner says it\u0027s the end, it is - regardless of what you think.\u0027\\n\\n He half-rose, but Marlene sat where she was. \u0027Because I want to offer you something you would dearly like to have.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The good riddance of my mother.\u0027\\n\\n Pitt sank back into his chair, truly puzzled. \u0027What do you mean by that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you will listen to me, Commissioner, I will tell you. My mother can\u0027t live like this. She\u0027s concerned about Earth and the Solar System and - and she thinks about my father sometimes. She thinks that Nemesis may be the nemesis of the Solar System and since she gave it the name, she feels responsible. She\u0027s an emotional person, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes? You\u0027ve noticed that, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And she bothers you. She reminds you every once in a while about matters that she feels strongly about, and you don\u0027t want to hear about, and so you refuse to see her, and you wish she\u0027d go away. You can send her away, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed? We\u0027ve got one other Settlement. Shall I send her to New Rotor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Commissioner. Send her to Erythro.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Erythro? But why should I send her there? Just because I want to get rid of her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That would be your reason. Yes, Commissioner. It would not be my reason, though. I want her on Erythro because she can\u0027t really work at the Observatory. The instruments always seem to be in use and she feels she\u0027s being watched all the time. She feels your annoyance. And besides, Rotor isn\u0027t a good base for delicate measurements. It turns too rapidly and too unevenly for good measurements.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have it all at your fingertips. Did your mother explain this to you? No, you don\u0027t have to tell me. She didn\u0027t tell you directly, did she? Only indirectly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Commissioner. And there\u0027s my computer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The one you have friendly relations with?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And so you think she will be able to work better on Erythro.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Commissioner. It will be a stabler base, and she might make the kind of measurements that will convince her that the Solar System will survive. Even if she finds out otherwise, it will take a long time for her to be sure of that and for that time, at least, you\u0027ll be rid of her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see that you want to be rid of her, too, is that it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all, Commissioner,\u0027 said Marlene with composure. \u0027I would go with her. You\u0027d be rid of me, too, which would please you even more than being rid of her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What makes you think I want to get rid of you, too?\u0027\\n\\n Marlene fixed her gaze on him, somber, unblinking. \u0027Now you do, Commissioner, since you now know that I have no trouble in interpreting your inner feelings.\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly, Pitt found himself desperately wanting to get rid of this monster. He said, \u0027Let me think about this,\u0027 and turned his head. He felt that he was being childish in looking away, but he did not want this horrible youngster to read his face like the open book it was.\\n\\n It was, after all, the truth. He did now want to get rid of mother and daughter alike. Where the mother was concerned, he had indeed thought, on several occasions, of exiling her to Erythro. But since she would scarcely have wanted to go, there would have been a most unappetizing fuss and he had no stomach for that. Now, though, her daughter had given him a reason why she might indeed want to go to Erythro, and that, of course, changed things.\\n\\n He said slowly, \u0027If your mother really wants this-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She really does, Commissioner. She hasn\u0027t mentioned it to me, and it may be she hasn\u0027t even thought of it yet, but she will want to go. I know that. Trust me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do I have a choice? And do you want to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very much, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I will arrange for it at once. Does that satisfy you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, it does, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then shall we now consider the interview at an end?\u0027\\n\\n Marlene rose and ducked her head in a graceless bow, presumably one that was intended to be respectful. \u0027Thank you, Commissioner.\u0027\\n\\n She turned and left, and it wasn\u0027t till she had been gone for several minutes that Pitt dared unclench the grip that had kept his face in place till it was aching,\\n\\n He dared not have allowed her to deduce from anything he said or did or seemed, the final item that he, and only one other person, knew about Erythro. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-11.html","bookId":1743,"book":{"id":1743,"title":"Nemesis","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-third century pioneers have escaped the crowded earth for life in self-sustaining orbital colonies.
