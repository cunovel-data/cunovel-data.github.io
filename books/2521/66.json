My turn.” Cole pried me out of the girls’ arms and pulled me into the locker room. He faced me.\\n\\n Before he could speak, I stood on my tiptoes and pressed my mouth into his.\\n\\n His hands wrapped around my waist and lifted me, even as he pressed my back into the wall. I wound my legs around him and drew him ever closer. The kiss deepened, our tongues rolling together, sure and confident, driving me crazy with heat and sweetness and sensation.\\n\\n His strength surrounded me. He was all that I knew, all that I wanted to know. We were the only two people alive. And we were together. Now, always.\\n\\n “You need to sleep in your old bedroom tonight,” he said. “I’m sending everyone home and sneaking in.”\\n\\n “Don’t want Kat and Reeve to hear your best moves?”\\n\\n “Don’t want Kat and Reeve to hear the way you respond to my best moves.”\\n\\n Oh, my.\\n\\n “Are we officially back together?” I asked.\\n\\n “I should spank you for even saying that. We’ve been together this whole time. You were just being stubborn.” He kissed his way down my neck. “I’ve never been so scared in my life, Ali. I’ve been trying to hold it together, but watching you spiral, then watching you fade and not knowing what to do...” He shuddered.\\n\\n “I told you to have faith.” I nibbled on the lobe of his ear. “We survived and we learned. We’re stronger than ever now.”\\n\\n He moaned, tilting his head to allow me better access. “Against the zombies, yes. But what about Anima? They’re still out there, and they have to be stopped for good.”\\n\\n “We’ll figure it out,” I said. “Right now you’re going to kiss me until I have a permanent impression of your lips on mine. Then you’re going to send everyone home. Then you’re going to sneak into my room, as promised. Then you’re going to show me just how much you love me.”\\n\\n “Consider it done. But if someone interrupts us tonight, I’m going to... I’m not sure there’s an action violent enough.”\\n\\n I laughed.\\n\\n He softened. “I love when you laugh. It’s the perfect birthday present.”\\n\\n My eyes widened. “Today’s your birthday?”\\n\\n “No. January ninth.”\\n\\n A few days ago. I’d missed it, I realized, and frowned. “Cole—”\\n\\n “No. You were sick, and I wasn’t going to celebrate without you.”\\n\\n “Well, you’re eighteen. Legal. You’re getting a party,” I said. “A surprise party.”\\n\\n He was the one to laugh this time. “Then why are you telling me about it?”\\n\\n “Oh, just shut up and kiss me.”\\n\\n A Note From Cole\\n\\n I’d rather not write this. You want to know how I feel. You want to know, in minute detail, why I did what I did, what happened behind the scenes, what I think of my mistakes, the outcome and what I plan to do next. You want me to describe the things I’m desperate to do with Ali.\\n\\n Why don’t you just take my sac, instead? The result will be the same.\\n\\n I’m not a bare-your-heart-to-strangers kind of guy, and that’s not going to change, so I’m not going to give you what you want. No, I’m not sorry.\\n\\n I know this proves everything you’ve heard whispered about me. I’m too hard-core. I’m only nice to a select few. I’m mean, bossy. I’m not an easy guy to like. Some people can take me, but most would rather leave me.\\n\\n I don’t really care.\\n\\n I am what life has made me.\\n\\n Besides, you’re wrong about all of it—I’m worse.\\n\\n Here’s what I will tell you: I’ve seen and done things that would make you vomit. I spend the majority of my time in the shadows, and sometimes darkness clings. Sometimes it’s hard to shake off. But most important, I will die to protect what’s mine—better yet, I will kill.\\n\\n Ali is mine.\\n\\n If you’re out there, Anima—and I know that you are—if you’re planning to make another move against my girl, you had better be prepared to battle the beast you’ll wake. I will hunt you, and I will not stop. I will take you out one by one, until the last of you is gone.\\n\\n You may look at me and see a teenager. An afterthought. I will look at you and see a target. A dead one.\\n\\n I’m very good at hitting my targets.\\n\\n So, think long and hard before you decide to take me on. There is nothing I won’t do—nothing—to ensure the health and wellness of those I love. If you’re smart, you’ll run and hide before it comes to that.\\n\\n This is the only warning you will receive. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-zombie-glass-white-rabbit-chronicles-2/page-66.html","bookId":2521,"book":{"id":2521,"title":"Through the Zombie Glass (White Rabbit Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: Through the Zombie Glass (White Rabbit Chronicles #2) \\n Zombies stalk the night.
