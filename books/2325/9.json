I don\u0027t mean I framed any choirboys. Anybody I ever hung anything on was bad to start with. I\u0027d know a guy did a certain job, and I\u0027d know I couldn\u0027t touch him for it, but then I might find some eyewitnesses suggestible enough to ID him for something he hadn\u0027t done, and that was enough to put him away. Case closed.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a lot of guys in the joint who didn\u0027t do what they went away for,\" he allowed. \"Not all of them. I mean, three out of four cons\u0027ll swear they were innocent of what they\u0027re doing time for, but you can\u0027t believe \u0027em. Cons\u0027ll con you. I mean, they lie.\" He shrugged. \"But sometimes it\u0027s the truth.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not sure I regret putting the right people away for the wrong reason. It got them off the street, and they were people who didn\u0027t do the street a whole lot of good. But that didn\u0027t necessarily make it the right thing for me to do, so I figured it belonged in my fifth step.\"\\n\\n \"So you told somebody about it.\"\\n\\n \"And more. Things that weren\u0027t against the law, but that bothered me more than other things that were. Like running around on my wife while I was married. Like not having time for my kids, like walking out on them around the time I left the department. Like not being there for people in general. One time an aunt of mine was dying of thyroid cancer. She was my mother\u0027s younger sister, she was all the family I had left, and I kept promising myself I would go and see her in the hospital, and I kept putting it off and putting it off, and the woman died. I felt so bad about not getting to the hospital that I didn\u0027t get to the funeral, either. I sent flowers, though, and I went to some fucking church and lit a fucking candle, all of which must have been a hell of a comfort to the dead woman.\"\\n\\n We walked in silence for a few minutes, heading west on one of the streets in the low Fifties, then taking a left on Tenth Avenue. We passed a lowdown saloon with the door open and that stale beer smell rolled out at us, sickening and inviting all at once. He asked if I\u0027d ever been in the place.\\n\\n \"Not lately,\" I said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a real bucket of blood,\" he said. \"Matt? You ever kill anybody?\"\\n\\n \"Twice in the line of duty. And once accidentally, and that was line of duty, too. A bullet of mine ricocheted and killed a child.\"\\n\\n \"You mentioned that last night.\"\\n\\n \"Did I? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don\u0027t. Once after I left the department a guy jumped me on the street in connection with a case I was working on. I threw him and he landed wrong and died of a broken neck. And another time, Christ, I was all of a week sober, and this crazy Colombian charged me with a machete and I emptied a gun into him. So the answer is yes, I\u0027ve killed four people, five if you count the kid.\\n\\n \"And, except for the kid, I don\u0027t think I ever lost a night\u0027s sleep over any of them. And I never agonized over the assholes I sent up for something they didn\u0027t do. I think it was wrong to do it, I wouldn\u0027t do it that way now, but none of that stuff bothers me anywhere near as much as not visiting Aunt Peg when she was dying. But that\u0027s an alcoholic for you. The big stuff is easy. It\u0027s the little shit that drives us crazy.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it\u0027s the big stuff, too.\"\\n\\n \"Something eating you, Eddie?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit, I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m a neighborhood guy, Matt. I grew up in these streets. You grew up in Hell\u0027s Kitchen, the one thing you learned was not to tell nothing to nobody. \u0027Don\u0027t tell your business to strangers.\u0027 My mother was an honest woman, Matt. She found a dime in a pay phone, she\u0027d look around for somebody to give it back to, but I must of heard her say it a thousand times. \u0027Don\u0027t tell nobody your business.\u0027 And she walked the walk, God bless her. Two, three times a week till the day he died, the old man\u0027d come home half in the bag and slap her around. And she kept it to herself. Anybody asked her, oh, she was clumsy, she walked into a door, she lost her balance, she fell down a flight of stairs. But most people knew not to ask. If you lived in the Kitchen, you knew what not to ask.\"\\n\\n I started to say something but he took my arm and urged me to the curb. \"Let\u0027s cross the street,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t like to walk past that place if I don\u0027t have to.\"\\n\\n The place in question was Grogan\u0027s Open House. Green neon in the window offered Harp lager and Guinness stout. \"I used to hang out there a lot,\" he explained. \"I like to steer clear of it now.\"\\n\\n I knew the feeling. There was a time when I drank away the days and nights at Armstrong\u0027s, and when I first got sober I\u0027d go out of my way to avoid passing the place. When I had to walk past it I would avert my eyes and speed up my pace, as if I might otherwise be drawn in against my will, like iron filings to a magnet. Then Jimmy lost his lease and relocated a block west at Tenth and Fifty-seventh, and a Chinese restaurant moved into his old spot, and I had one less problem in my life.\\n\\n \"You know who owns that joint, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"Somebody named Grogan?\"\\n\\n \"Not in years. That\u0027s Mickey Ballou\u0027s place.\"\\n\\n \"The Butcher Boy?\"\\n\\n \"You know Mickey?\"\\n\\n \"Only by sight. By sight and by reputation.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s a sight and he\u0027s got a reputation. You won\u0027t find his name on the license, but it\u0027s his store. When I was a kid I was tight with his brother Dennis. Then he got killed in Vietnam. Were you in the service, Matt?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"They weren\u0027t drafting cops.\"\\n\\n \"I had TB when I was a kid. I never knew it at the time, but there was something showed up on the X ray, kept me out of the service.\" He threw his cigarette in the gutter. \"Another reason to quit these things. But not today, huh?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got time.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. He was okay, Dennis. Then after he died I did some things with Mick. You heard the stories about him?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard some stories.\"\\n\\n \"You heard about him and the bowling bag? And what he had in it?\"\\n\\n \"I never knew whether to believe it or not.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I wasn\u0027t there. One time, though, and this was some years ago, I was in a basement two, three blocks from where we\u0027re standing now. They had a guy, I forget what he done. Ratted somebody out, it must of been. They\u0027re in the furnace room and they got him tied to a post with a clothesline, and a gag in his mouth, and Mickey puts on this long white butcher\u0027s apron, covers you from your shoulders down to your feet. The apron\u0027s pure white except for the stains on it. And Mickey picks up a ball bat and starts wailing on the guy, and the blood sprays all over the place. Next time I see Mickey he\u0027s in the Open House with the apron on. He likes to wear it, like he\u0027s a butcher just off work, ducked in for a quick one. \u0027See that?\u0027 he says, pointing to a fresh stain. \u0027Know what that is? That\u0027s rat blood.\u0027 \"\\n\\n We had reached the corner a block south of Grogan\u0027s Open House, and now we crossed Tenth Avenue again. He said, \"I was never no Al Capone, but I done stuff. I mean, shit, voting for Abe Beame\u0027s the closest I ever came to an honest day\u0027s work. I\u0027m thirty-seven years old and the only time I ever had a Social Security card was in Green Haven. They had me working in the laundry there for whatever it was. Thirty cents an hour? Something ridiculous like that, and they had to take out taxes and Social Security, so you had to get a Social Security card. Up to then I never had one, and after that I never used it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re working now, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Little get-well jobs. Sweeping out a couple of joints after closing, Dan Kelly\u0027s and Pete\u0027s All-American. You know the All-American?\"\\n\\n \"Talk about a bucket of blood. I would duck in there for a quick one, but I never stayed any length of time.\"\\n\\n \"Like making a pit stop. I used to love that, walk into a bar, have a quick pop, then out again to face the world. Anyway, I go into those two joints late at night or early in the morning, sweep the place out, take out the empties, put the chairs back around the tables. And there\u0027s a moving company down in the Village gives me a day\u0027s work now and then. Everything\u0027s off the books, you don\u0027t need no Social Security card for those jobs. I get by.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"My rent\u0027s cheap, and I don\u0027t eat much, I never ate much, and what am I gonna spend my dough on? Night-clubs? Fancy clothes? Fuel for my yacht?\"\\n\\n \"Sounds as though you\u0027re doing all right.\"\\n\\n He stopped walking, turned to face me. \"Yeah, but I\u0027m just shooting the shit, Matt.\" He put his hands in his pockets and stood looking down at the pavement. \"The point is I done stuff I don\u0027t know if I want to tell anybody about. Admitting it to myself, all right, like I already know it, right? So it\u0027s just a matter of getting honest and facing up to it. And admitting it to God, well, man, if there\u0027s no God it don\u0027t make no difference, and if there is a God He already knows everything you done, so that part\u0027s easy. But coming clean with another person, shit, I don\u0027t know, Matt. I done certain things that you could go away for, and in some cases there\u0027s other people involved, and I just don\u0027t know how I feel about all that.\"\\n\\n \"A lot of people take the step with a priest.\"\\n\\n \"You mean like confession?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s a little different. You\u0027re not seeking formal absolution as much as you\u0027re attempting to unburden yourself. You don\u0027t have to be a Catholic, and you don\u0027t have to go through it in a church. You can even find a priest who\u0027s sober in AA and understands what the program\u0027s all about. But even if he\u0027s not he\u0027d be bound by the seal of the confessional, so you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about him saying anything to anybody.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t tell you the last time I was in a church. Wait a minute, did you hear what I just said? Christ, I was in a church an hour ago. I been going into church basements once or twice a day for months. But the last time I went to mass, well, I went to a couple weddings over the years, Catholic weddings, but I didn\u0027t take communion. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s more than twenty years since I made confession.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be with a priest. But if you\u0027re worried about confidentiality-\"\\n\\n \"Is that how you did it? With a priest?\"\\n\\n \"I took it with another person from the program. You know him. Jim Faber.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I know him.\"\\n\\n \"Sure you do. He comes to St. Paul \u0027s all the time, he was there tonight. He\u0027s a few years older than I am. Hair\u0027s mostly gray, wears a beat-up army jacket most of the time. You\u0027d know him if you saw him.\"\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t at the Flame, was he?\"\\n\\n \"Not tonight.\"\\n\\n \"What is he, a cop or a detective or something?\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s a printer, he\u0027s got his own shop over on Eleventh Avenue.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jim the Printer,\" he said. \"Been sober a long time.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s coming up on nine years.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, that\u0027s a long time.\"\\n\\n \"He would tell you he just did it a day at a time.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s what they all tell you. It\u0027s still nine fucking years, isn\u0027t it? No matter how you slice it, divide it into hours and minutes if you want, it still comes to nine years.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the truth.\"\\n\\n He took out another cigarette, changed his mind, returned it to the pack. \"Is he your sponsor?\"\\n\\n \"Not formally. I\u0027ve never had a sponsor in any formal way. I\u0027ve never been very good at doing things the way you\u0027re supposed to. Jim\u0027s the person I call when I want to talk about something. If I call anybody.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-9.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) \\n It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
