She cleared the table, opened a second bottle of Beck\u0027s. \"I\u0027ll have to learn the ground rules,\" she said. \"I feel a little funny about drinking in front of you.\"\\n\\n \"Do I make you uncomfortable?\"\\n\\n \"No, but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll make you uncomfortable. I didn\u0027t know if it was all right to talk about how great beer is with Chinese food because, oh, I don\u0027t know. Is is all right to talk about booze that way?\"\\n\\n \"What do you think we do at meetings? We talk about booze all the time. Some of us spend more time talking about it than we used to spend drinking it.\"\\n\\n \"But don\u0027t you tell yourselves how terrible it was?\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes. And sometimes we tell each other how wonderful it was.\"\\n\\n \"I never would have guessed that.\"\\n\\n \"That didn\u0027t surprise me as much as the laughter. People tell about the damnedest things that happened to them, and everybody breaks up.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t think they\u0027d talk about it, let alone laugh. I guess I thought it would be like mentioning rope in the house of the hanged.\"\\n\\n \"In the house of the hanged,\" I said, \"that\u0027s probably the chief topic of conversation.\"\\n\\n Later she said, \"I keep wanting to bring the flowers in here. That\u0027s crazy, there\u0027s no room for them. They\u0027re better in the kitchen.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll still be there in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m like a kid, aren\u0027t I? Can I tell you something?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"God. I don\u0027t know if I should tell you this. Well, with that preamble, I guess I have to, don\u0027t I? Nobody ever gave me flowers before.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s pretty hard to believe.\"\\n\\n \"Why is it so hard to believe? I spent twenty years devoting myself heart and soul to revolutionary politics. Radical activists don\u0027t give each other flowers. I mean, talk about your bourgeois sentimentality, your late capitalist decadence. Mao said let a thousand flowers bloom, but that didn\u0027t mean you were supposed to pluck a handful and take them home to your sweetie. You weren\u0027t even supposed to have a sweetie. If a relationship didn\u0027t serve the party, you had no business in it.\"\\n\\n \"But you got out of there a few years ago. You were married.\"\\n\\n \"To an old hippie. Long hair and fringed buckskin and love beads. He should have had a 1967 calendar on his wall. He was locked in the sixties, he never knew they\u0027d ended.\" She shook her head. \"He never brought home flowers. Flowering tops, yes, but not flowers.\"\\n\\n \"Flowering tops?\"\\n\\n \"The most potent part of the marijuana plant. Cannabis sativa, if you want to be formal. Do you smoke?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t in years, because I\u0027m afraid it would lead me right back to cigarettes. That\u0027s funny, isn\u0027t it? They try to scare you that it\u0027ll lead to heroin, and I\u0027m afraid it might lead to tobacco. But I never liked it that much. I never liked feeling out of control.\"\\n\\n The flowers were still there in the morning.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t intended to stay the night, but then I hadn\u0027t planned on dropping in on her in the first place. The hours just slipped away from us. We talked, we shared silences, we listened to music, and to the rain.\\n\\n I awoke before she did. I had a drunk dream. They\u0027re not uncommon, but I hadn\u0027t had one in a while. The details were gone by the time I got my eyes open, but in the dream someone had offered me a beer and I had taken it without thinking. By the time I realized I couldn\u0027t do that, I\u0027d already drunk half of it.\\n\\n I woke up not sure if it was a dream and not entirely certain where I was. It was six in the morning and I wouldn\u0027t have wanted to go back to sleep even if I could, for fear of slipping back into the dream. I got up and dressed, not showering to keep from waking her. I was tying my shoes when I felt that I was being watched, and I turned to see her looking at me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s early,\" I said. \"Go back to sleep. I\u0027ll call you later.\"\\n\\n I went back to my hotel. There was a message for me. Jim Faber had called, but it was far too early to call him back. I went upstairs and showered and shaved, then stretched out on the bed for a minute and surprised myself by dozing off. I hadn\u0027t even felt tired, but I wound up sleeping for three hours and woke up groggy.\\n\\n I took another shower and shook off the grogginess. I called Jim at his shop.\\n\\n \"I missed you last night,\" he said. \"I was just wondering how you were doing.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to hear it. You missed a great qualification.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"Guy from Midtown Group. Very funny stuff. He went through a period where he kept trying to kill himself and couldn\u0027t get it right. He couldn\u0027t swim a stroke, so he rented a flat-bottom rowboat and rowed for miles. Finally, he stood up, said. \u0027Goodbye, cruel world,\u0027 and threw himself over the side.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And he was on a sandbar. He was in two feet of water.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes you can\u0027t do a single thing right.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, everybody has days like that.\"\\n\\n \"I had a drunk dream last night,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"I drank half a beer before I realized what I was doing. Then I realized, and I felt horrible, and I drank the rest of it.\"\\n\\n \"Where was this?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember the details.\"\\n\\n \"No, where was it you spent the night?\"\\n\\n \"Nosy bastard, aren\u0027t you? I stayed over with Willa.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s her name? The super?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Was she drinking?\"\\n\\n \"Not enough to matter.\"\\n\\n \"Not enough to matter to whom?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ,\" I said. \"I was with her for about eight hours, not counting the time we slept, and in all that time she had two beers, one with dinner and one after. Does that make her an alcoholic?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not the question. The question is does it make you uncomfortable.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t remember when I last spent a more comfortable night.\"\\n\\n \"What brand of beer was she drinking?\"\\n\\n \"Beck\u0027s. What\u0027s the difference?\"\\n\\n \"What did you drink in your dream?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n \"What did it taste like?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember the taste. I wasn\u0027t aware of it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a hell of a note. If you\u0027re going to drink in your dreams, at least you ought to be able to taste it and enjoy it. You want to get together for lunch?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve got some things I have to do.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll see you tonight, then.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n I hung up, irritated. I felt as though I was being treated like a child, and my response was to turn childishly irritable. What difference did it make what kind of beer I drank in my dream?\\n\\n Andreotti wasn\u0027t on duty when I got over to the precinct house. He was downtown, testifying before a grand jury. The guy he\u0027d been partnered with, Bill Bellamy, couldn\u0027t understand what I wanted with the medical examiner\u0027s report.\\n\\n \"You were there,\" he said. \"It\u0027s open and shut. Time of death was sometime late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, that\u0027s according to the preliminary report from the man on the scene. All evidence on the scene supports a finding of accidental death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Everything- the pornography, the position of the body, the nudity, everything. We see these all the time, Scudder.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Then you probably know it\u0027s the best-kept secret in America, because what paper\u0027s going to print that the deceased died jerking off with a rope around his neck? And it\u0027s not just kids. We had one last year, this was a married guy and his wife found him. Decent people, beautiful apartment on West End Avenue. Married fifteen years! Poor woman didn\u0027t understand, couldn\u0027t understand. She couldn\u0027t even believe that he masturbated, let alone that he liked to strangle hisself while he did it.\"\\n\\n \"I understand how it works.\"\\n\\n \"Then what\u0027s your interest? You got some kind of an insurance angle, your client can\u0027t collect if you get a suicide verdict?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t got a client. And I doubt he had any insurance.\"\\n\\n \"Because I remember we had an insurance investigator come up in connection with the gentleman from West End Avenue. He had a whole lot of coverage, too. Might have been as much as a million dollars.\"\\n\\n \"And they didn\u0027t want to pay it?\"\\n\\n \"They were going to have to pay something. Suicide\u0027ll only nullify a policy for a certain amount of time after it\u0027s taken out, to prevent you from signing up when you\u0027ve already decided to kill yourself. This case, he\u0027d had the policy long enough so suicide didn\u0027t cancel it. So what was the hook?\" He frowned, then brightened. \"Oh, right. He had that double indemnity clause where they pay you twice as much for accidental death. I have to say I never saw the logic to that. I mean, dead is dead. What\u0027s the difference if you have a heart attack or wreck your car? Your wife\u0027s got the same living expenses, your kid\u0027s college is gonna cost the same. I never understood it.\"\\n\\n \"The insurer didn\u0027t want to accept a claim of accidental death?\"\\n\\n \"You got it. Said a man puts a rope around his neck and hangs hisself, that\u0027s suicide. The wife got herself a good lawyer and they had to pay the whole amount. Man had the intention of hanging hisself, but he did not have the intention of killing hisself, and that made it an accident and not a suicide.\" He smiled, liking the justice of it, then remembered the matter at hand. \"But you\u0027re not here about insurance.\"\\n\\n \"No, and I\u0027m pretty sure he didn\u0027t have any. He was a friend of mine.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting friend for you to have. Turns out he had a sheet on him longer than his dick.\"\\n\\n \"Mostly small-time, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"According to what he got collared for. Far as what he got away with, how could you say? Maybe he kidnapped the Lindbergh baby and went scot-free.\"\\n\\n \"I think it was a little before his time. I have a fair idea of the kind of life he used to lead, although I don\u0027t know the details. But for the past year he\u0027s been staying sober.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re saying he was an alcoholic.\"\\n\\n \"A sober one.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"I want to know if he died sober.\"\\n\\n \"What difference does it make?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to explain.\"\\n\\n \"I got an uncle used to be a terrible alcoholic. He quit drinking and now he\u0027s a different person.\"\\n\\n \"It works that way sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Used to be you didn\u0027t want to know the man, and now he\u0027s a fine human being. Goes to church, holds a job, acts right with people. Your friend, it didn\u0027t look like he\u0027d been drinking. There was no bottles laying around.\"\\n\\n \"No, but he might have done some drinking elsewhere. Or he could have taken other drugs.\"\\n\\n \"You mean like heroin?\"\\n\\n \"I would doubt it.\"\\n\\n \"Because I didn\u0027t see no tracks. Still, there\u0027s more than you think that\u0027ll snort it.\"\\n\\n \"Any drugs,\" I said. \"They\u0027re doing a complete autopsy, aren\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"They got to. The law requires it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, could I see the results when you get them?\"\\n\\n \"Just so you\u0027ll know if he died sober?\" He sighed. \"I guess. But what does it matter? They got some rule, he\u0027s got to be sober when he dies or they won\u0027t bury him in the good section of the cemetery?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-19.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) \\n It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
