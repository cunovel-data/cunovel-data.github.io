{"id":63138,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Not in the third grade.\"\n He laughed. \"No, it was a little later than that. Thing is, the old man died while I was up in Green Haven, and when I got out I didn\u0027t have a place to stay, so I moved in with my ma. I wasn\u0027t home much, it was just a place to keep my clothes and stuff, but then when she got sick I started staying there with her, and after she died I kept the place. Three little rooms up on the fourth floor, but, you know, it\u0027s rent-controlled, Matt. $122.75 a month. A hotel you\u0027d be willing to step into, in this town, shit, you\u0027d pay that for one night.\"\n And, amazingly enough, the neighborhood itself was on its way up. Hell\u0027s Kitchen had been a tough, hard-bitten neighborhood for a hundred years, and now the realtors had people calling it Clinton and turning tenement flats into condos and getting six-figure prices for them. I could never figure out where the poor people went, or where the rich people came from.\n He said, \"Beautiful night, isn\u0027t it? Of course before we know it we\u0027ll be griping that it\u0027s too cold. One day you\u0027re dying of the heat and the next minute you\u0027re wondering where the summer went. Always the way, huh?\"\n \"That\u0027s what they say.\"\n He was in his late thirties, five-eight or -nine and slender, with pale skin and washed-out blue eyes. His hair was light brown and he was losing it, and the receding hairline combined with an overbite to give him a slightly rabbity appearance.\n If I hadn\u0027t known he\u0027d done time I would probably have guessed as much, although I couldn\u0027t tell you why beyond saying that he looked like a crook. A combination, perhaps, of bravado and furtiveness, an attitude that manifested physically in the set of the shoulders and the shiftiness of the eyes. I wouldn\u0027t say that it stood out all over him, but the first time I noticed him at a meeting I had the thought that here was a guy who\u0027d been dirty, a guy who had most likely gone away for it.\n He took out a pack of cigarettes and offered me one. I shook my head. He selected one for himself and scratched a match to light it, cupping his hands against the wind. He blew out smoke, then held the cigarette between his thumb and forefinger and looked at it. \"I ought to quit these little fuckers,\" he said. \"Sober up and die of cancer, where\u0027s the percentage in that?\"\n \"How long are you sober now, Eddie?\"\n \"Coming up on seven months.\"\n \"That\u0027s great.\"\n \"I been coming around the program for close to a year, but it took me a while to put down the drink.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t catch on right away, either.\"\n \"No? Well, I slipped around for a month or two. And then I thought I could still smoke dope, because what the hell, marijuana wasn\u0027t my problem, alcohol was my problem. But I guess what I heard at the meetings finally soaked in, and I put down the grass, too, and now I\u0027ve been completely clean and dry for close to seven months.\"\n \"That\u0027s terrific.\"\n \"I guess.\"\n \"As far as the cigarettes are concerned, they say it\u0027s not a good idea to try to do too many things at once.\"\n \"I know it. I figure when I make my year is time enough to quit these things.\" He sucked hard on the cigarette and the end glowed red. \"This is where I get off. You sure you don\u0027t want to get some coffee?\"\n \"No, but I\u0027ll walk over to Ninth with you.\"\n We walked the long block crosstown and then stood on the corner talking for a few minutes. I don\u0027t remember much of what we talked about. On the corner he said, \"When he introduced you he said your home group was Keep It Simple. That\u0027s the group meets over at St. Paul the Apostle?\"\n I nodded. \"The official name is Keep It Simple, but everybody just calls it St. Paul \u0027s.\"\n \"You go there pretty regular?\"\n \"More often than not.\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll see you there. Uh, you got a phone or something, Matt?\"\n \"Sure. I\u0027m at a hotel, the Northwestern. You just call the desk and they\u0027ll put you through to me.\"\n \"Who do I ask for?\"\n I looked at him for a second, then laughed. I had a small stack of wallet-size photos in my breast pocket, each stamped on the back with my name and phone number. I took one out and handed it to him. He said, \" \u0027Matthew Scudder.\u0027 That\u0027s you, huh?\" He turned the card over. \"That\u0027s not you, though.\"\n \"You recognize her?\"\n He shook his head. \"Who is she?\"\n \"A girl I\u0027m trying to find.\"\n \"I don\u0027t blame you. Find two while you\u0027re at it, I\u0027ll take one of \u0027em off your hands. What is it, a job you\u0027re working?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Pretty girl. Young, or at least she was when this was taken. What is she, about twenty-one?\"\n \"Twenty-four now. The picture\u0027s a year or two old.\"\n \"Twenty-four\u0027s pretty young,\" he said. He turned the card again. \"Matthew Scudder. It\u0027s funny how you\u0027ll know the most personal things about somebody but you won\u0027t know their name. Their last name, I mean. Mine\u0027s Dunphy, but maybe you already knew that.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I\u0027d give you my phone if I had one. They cut it off for nonpayment a year and a half ago. One of these days I\u0027ll have to get it straightened out. It\u0027s been good talking to you, Matt. Maybe I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night at St. Paul \u0027s.\"\n \"I\u0027ll most likely be there.\"\n \"I\u0027ll make a point of getting there. You take care now.\"\n \"You too, Eddie.\"\n He waited for the light, trotted across the avenue. Halfway across he turned and gave me a smile. \"I hope you find that girl,\" he said.\n I didn\u0027t find her that night, or any other girl, either. I walked the rest of the way to Fifty-seventh Street and stopped at the desk. There were no messages but Jacob volunteered that I\u0027d had three calls spaced half an hour apart. \"Could be it was the same person each time,\" he said. \"He didn\u0027t leave no message.\"\n I went up to my room, sat down and opened a book. I read a few pages and the phone rang.\n I picked it up and a man said, \"This Scudder?\" I said it was. He said, \"How much is the reward?\"\n \"What reward?\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you the man looking to find that girl?\"\n I could have hung up, but instead I said, \"What girl?\"\n \"Her picture\u0027s on one side and your name\u0027s on the other. Don\u0027t you be looking for her?\"\n \"Do you know where she is?\"\n \"Answer my question first,\" he said. \"What\u0027s the reward?\"\n \"There might be a small reward.\"\n \"How small is small?\"\n \"Not enough to get rich on.\"\n \"Say a number.\"\n \"Maybe a couple of hundred dollars.\"\n \"Five hundred dollars?\"\n The price didn\u0027t really matter. He didn\u0027t have anything to sell me. \"All right,\" I agreed. \"Five hundred.\"\n \"Shit. That\u0027s not much.\"\n \"I know.\"\n There was a pause. Then he said, briskly, \"All right. Here\u0027s what you do. You know the corner of Broadway and Fifty-third Street, the uptown corner on the side towards Eighth Avenue. Meet me there in a half hour. And have the money with you. If you don\u0027t bring the bread, don\u0027t bother coming.\"\n \"I can\u0027t get the money at this hour.\"\n \"Ain\u0027t you got one of those all-night bank cards? Shit. All right, how much you got on you? You can give me some now and the rest tomorrow, but you don\u0027t want to stand around, man, because the chick might not be in the same place tomorrow, you dig what I\u0027m saying?\"\n \"More than you know.\"\n \"Say what?\"\n \"What\u0027s her name?\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"What\u0027s the chick\u0027s name?\"\n \"You the one looking for her. Don\u0027t you know her damn name?\"\n \"You don\u0027t, do you?\"\n He thought about it. \"I know the name she using now,\" he said. It\u0027s the stupidest ones that turn crafty. \"That\u0027s probably not the name you know.\"\n \"What name\u0027s she using?\"\n \"Uh-huh. That\u0027s part of what you be buying with your five hundred dollars.\"\n What I\u0027d be buying would be a forearm across the windpipe, possibly a knife between the ribs. The ones who have something for you never start out asking about a reward, and they don\u0027t want to meet you on streetcorners. I felt tired enough to hang up on him, but he\u0027d just call back again.\n I said, \"Shut up for a minute. My client\u0027s not authorizing any reward until the girl\u0027s recovered. You haven\u0027t got anything to sell and there\u0027s no way you\u0027re going to hustle a buck out of me. I don\u0027t want to meet you on a streetcorner, but if I did I wouldn\u0027t bring money with me. I\u0027d bring a gun and a set of cuffs and a backup, and then I\u0027d take you somewhere and work on you until I was sure you didn\u0027t know anything. Then I\u0027d work on you some more because I\u0027d be pissed at you for wasting my time. Is that what you want? You want to meet me on the corner?\"\n \"Motherfucker-\"\n \"No,\" I said, \"you got that wrong. You\u0027re the motherfucker.\"\n I hung up on him. \"Asshole,\" I said aloud, to him or to myself, I\u0027m not sure which. Then I took a shower and went to bed.\n The girl\u0027s name was Paula Hoeldtke and I didn\u0027t really expect to find her. I\u0027d tried to tell her father as much but it\u0027s hard to tell people what they aren\u0027t prepared to hear.\n Warren Hoeldtke had a big square jaw and an open face and a lot of wiry carrot-colored hair that was going gray. He had a Subaru dealership in Muncie, Indiana, and I could picture him starring in his own television commercials, pointing at the cars, facing into the camera, telling people they\u0027ll get the best possible deal at Hoeldtke Subaru.\n Paula was the fourth of the Hoeldtkes\u0027 six children. She\u0027d gone to college at Ball State, right in Muncie. \"David Letterman went there,\" Hoeldtke told me. \"You probably knew that. Of course that was before Paula\u0027s time.\"\n She had majored in theater arts, and immediately after graduation she had come to New York. \"You can\u0027t make a career in the theater in Muncie,\" he told me. \"Or anywhere in the state, for that matter. You have to go to New York or California. But I don\u0027t know, even if it wasn\u0027t that she had the bug to be an actress, I think she would have left. She had that urge to get off on her own. Her two older sisters, they both of them married boys from out of town, and in both cases the husbands decided to move to Muncie. And her older brother, my son Gordon, he\u0027s in the car business with me. And there\u0027s a boy and a girl still in school, so who knows for sure what they\u0027re going to do, but my guess is they\u0027ll stay close. But Paula, she had that wanderlust. I was just glad she stuck around long enough to finish college.\"\n In New York she took acting classes, waited tables, lived in the West Fifties, and went on auditions. She had been in a showcase presentation of Another Part of Town at a storefront theater on Second Avenue and had taken part in a staged reading of Very Good Friends in the West Village. He had copies of the playbills and showed them to me, pointing out her name and the little capsule biographies that ran under the heading of \"Who\u0027s Who in the Cast.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t get paid for this,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t, you know, when you\u0027re starting out. It\u0027s so you can perform and people can see you- agents, casting people, directors. You hear all these salaries, this one getting five million dollars for a picture, but for most of them it\u0027s little or nothing for years.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-2.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) \n It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
