Not the reading, that was just actors standing on the stage and reading lines from a script, it didn\u0027t sound very appealing, although we would have come if Paula had wanted it. But she didn\u0027t even want us to come to the play. She said it wasn\u0027t a very good play and her part was small anyway. She said we should wait until she was in something decent.\"\n They had last heard from her in late June. She had sounded fine. She\u0027d said something about possibly getting out of the city for the summer, but she hadn\u0027t gone into detail. When a couple of weeks passed without word from her, they called her and kept getting her answering machine.\n \"She was hardly ever home. She said her room was tiny and dark and depressing, so she didn\u0027t spend much time in it. When I saw it the other day I could understand why. I didn\u0027t actually see her room, I just saw the building and the front hall, but I could understand. People pay high prices in New York to live in places that anywhere else would be torn down.\"\n Because she was rarely in, they did not ordinarily call her. Instead, they had a system. She would call every second or third Sunday, placing a person-to-person call for herself. They would tell the operator that Paula Hoeldtke was not at home, and then they would call her back station-to-station.\n \"It wasn\u0027t really cheating them,\" he said, \"because it cost the same as if she called us station-to-station, but this way it was on our phone bill instead of hers. And as a result she wasn\u0027t in a hurry to get off the phone, so actually the telephone company came out ahead, too.\"\n But she didn\u0027t call, nor did she respond to the messages on her machine. Toward the end of July, Hoeldtke and his wife and the youngest daughter gassed up one of the Subarus and took a trip, driving up into the Dakotas to spend a week riding horses at a ranch and seeing the Badlands and Mount Rushmore. It was mid-August when they got back, and when they tried Paula they didn\u0027t get her machine. Instead they got a recording informing them that her phone had been temporarily disconnected.\n \"If she went away for the summer,\" he said, \"she might have had the phone turned off to save money. But would she go away without letting anybody know? It wasn\u0027t like her. She might do something on the spur of the moment, but she would get in touch with you and let you know about it. She was responsible.\"\n But not too responsible. You couldn\u0027t set your watch by her. Sometimes, during the three years since she\u0027d graduated from Ball State, she\u0027d gone more than two or three weeks between phone calls. So it was possible she\u0027d gone somewhere during the summer and had been too preoccupied to get in touch. It was possible she\u0027d tried to call while her parents were mounted on horses, or hiking along trails in Wind Cave National Park.\n \"Ten days ago was her mother\u0027s birthday,\" Warren Hoeldtke said. \"And she didn\u0027t call.\"\n \"And that was something she wouldn\u0027t have missed?\"\n \"Never. She wouldn\u0027t have forgotten and she wouldn\u0027t have missed calling. And if she did miss she would have called the next day.\"\n He hadn\u0027t known what to do. He called the police in New York and got nowhere, predictably enough. He went to the Muncie office of a national detective agency. An investigator from their New York office visited her last known residence and established that she was no longer living there. If he cared to give them a substantial retainer, they would be glad to pursue the matter.\n \"I thought, what did they do for my money? Go to the place where she lived and find out she wasn\u0027t there? I could do that myself. So I got on a plane and came here.\"\n He\u0027d gone to the rooming house where Paula had lived. She had moved out sometime in early July, leaving no forwarding address. The telephone company had refused to tell him anything beyond what he already knew, that the telephone in question had been disconnected. He\u0027d gone to the restaurant where she\u0027d worked and found out that she\u0027d left that job back in April.\n \"She may even had told us that,\" he said. \"She must have worked six or seven places since she got to New York, and I don\u0027t know if she mentioned every time she changed jobs. She would leave because the tips weren\u0027t good, or she didn\u0027t get along with somebody, or because they wouldn\u0027t let her take off when she had an audition. So she could have left the last job and gone to work somewhere else without telling us, or she could have told us and it didn\u0027t register.\"\n He couldn\u0027t think what else to do on his own, so he\u0027d gone to the police. There he was told that in the first place it wasn\u0027t really a police matter, that she had evidently moved without informing her parents and that, as an adult, she had every legal right to do so. They told him, too, that he had waited too long, that she had disappeared almost three months ago and whatever trail she\u0027d left was a cold one by now.\n If he wanted to pursue the matter further, the police officer told him, he\u0027d be well advised to engage a private investigator. Department regulations prohibited his recommending a particular investigator. However, the officer said, it was probably all right for him to say what he himself would do if he happened to find himself in Mr. Hoeldtke\u0027s circumstances. There was a fellow named Scudder, an ex-cop as a matter of fact, and one who happened to reside in the very neighborhood where Mr. Hoeldtke\u0027s daughter had been living, and-\n \"Who was the cop?\"\n \"His name\u0027s Durkin.\"\n \"Joe Durkin,\" I said. \"That was very decent of him.\"\n \"I liked him.\"\n \"Yes, he\u0027s all right,\" I said. We were in a coffee shop on Fifty-seventh, a few doors down from my hotel. The lunch hour had ended before we got there, so they were letting us sit over coffee. I\u0027d had a refill. Hoeldtke still had his first cup in front of him.\n \"Mr. Hoeldtke,\" I said, \"I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m the man you want.\"\n \"Durkin said-\"\n \"I know what he said. The thing is, you can probably get better coverage from the people you used earlier, the ones with the Muncie office. They can put several operatives on the case and they can canvass a good deal more comprehensively than I can.\"\n \"Are you saying they can do a better job?\"\n I thought about it. \"No,\" I said, \"but they may be able to give the appearance. For one thing, they\u0027ll furnish you with detailed reports telling you exactly what they did and who they talked to and what they found out. They\u0027ll itemize their expenses and bill you very precisely for the hours they spend on the case.\" I took a sip of coffee, set the cup down in its saucer. I leaned forward and said, \"Mr. Hoeldtke, I\u0027m a pretty decent detective, but I\u0027m completely unofficial. You need a license to operate as a private investigator in this state and I don\u0027t have one. I\u0027ve never felt like going through the hassle of applying for one. I don\u0027t itemize expenses or keep track of my hours, and I don\u0027t provide detailed reports. I don\u0027t have an office, either, which is why we\u0027re meeting here over coffee. All I\u0027ve really got is whatever instincts and abilities I\u0027ve developed over the years, and I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s what you want to employ.\"\n \"Durkin didn\u0027t tell me you were unlicensed.\"\n \"Well, he could have. It\u0027s not a secret.\"\n \"Why do you suppose he recommended you?\"\n I must have been having an attack of scruples. Or maybe I didn\u0027t much want the job. \"Partly because he expects me to give him a referral fee,\" I said.\n Hoeldtke\u0027s face clouded. \"He didn\u0027t mention that either,\" he said.\n \"I\u0027m not surprised.\"\n \"That\u0027s not ethical,\" he said. \"Is it?\"\n \"No, but it wasn\u0027t really ethical for him to recommend anyone in the first place. And, to give him his due, he wouldn\u0027t have steered you to me unless he thought I was the right person for you to hire. He probably thinks I\u0027ll give you good value and a straight deal.\"\n \"And will you?\"\n I nodded. \"And part of a straight deal is to tell you in front that you\u0027re very likely wasting your money.\"\n \"Because-\"\n \"Because she\u0027ll probably either turn up on her own or she won\u0027t turn up at all.\"\n He was silent for a moment, considering the implications of what I\u0027d just said. Neither of us had yet mentioned the possibility that his daughter was dead, and it looked as though it was going to go unmentioned, but that didn\u0027t mean it was all that easy to avoid thinking about it.\n He said, \"How much money would I be wasting?\"\n \"Suppose you let me have a thousand dollars.\"\n \"Would that be an advance or a retainer or what?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027d want to call it,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t have a day rate and I don\u0027t keep track of my hours. I just go out there and do what seems to make sense. There are a batch of basic steps to take for openers, and I\u0027ll go through them first, although I don\u0027t really expect them to lead anywhere. Then there are a few other things I can do, and we\u0027ll see if they get us anyplace or not. When it seems to me that your thousand bucks is used up I\u0027ll ask you for more money, and you can decide whether or not you want to pay it.\"\n He had to laugh. \"Not a very businesslike approach,\" he said.\n \"I know it. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not a very businesslike person.\"\n \"In a curious way, that inspires confidence. The thousand dollars- I assume your expenses would be additional.\"\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t anticipate a lot in the way of expenses, and I\u0027d rather pay them myself than have to account for them.\"\n \"Would you want to run some newspaper ads? I\u0027d thought of doing that myself, either a listing in the personals or an ad with her photo and the offer of a reward. Of course that wouldn\u0027t come out of your thousand dollars. It would probably cost that much or more by itself, to do any kind of extensive advertising.\"\n I advised against it. \"She\u0027s too old to get her picture on a milk carton,\" I said, \"and I\u0027m not sure ads in the papers are a good idea. You just draw the hustlers and the reward-hunters that way, and they\u0027re more trouble than they\u0027re worth.\"\n \"I keep thinking that she might have amnesia. If she saw her photograph in the newspaper, or if someone else saw it-\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s a possibility,\" I said. \"But let\u0027s hold it in reserve for the time being.\"\n In the end, he gave me a check for a thousand dollars and a couple of pictures and what information he had- her last address, the names of several restaurants where she\u0027d worked. He let me keep the two playbills, assuring me that they had plenty of copies of both. I copied down his address in Muncie and his phone numbers at home and at the auto showroom. \"Call anytime at all,\" he said.\n I told him I probably wouldn\u0027t call until I had something concrete to report. When I did, he\u0027d hear from me.\n He paid for our coffees and left a dollar for the waitress. At the door he said, \"I feel good about this. I think I\u0027ve taken the right step. You come across as honest and straightforward, and I appreciate that.\"\n Outside, a three-card-monte dealer was working to a small crowd, telling the people to keep their eyes on the red card, keeping his own eye out for cops.\n \"I\u0027ve read about that game,\" Hoeldtke said.\n \"It\u0027s not a game,\" I told him. \"It\u0027s a short con, a swindle. The player never wins.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve read. Yet people keep playing.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. \"It\u0027s hard to figure.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-3.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) \n It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
