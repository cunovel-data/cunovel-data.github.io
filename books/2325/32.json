And it\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not drinking it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sipping it. I\u0027ve had gallons of coffee already today, it\u0027s been that kind of a day. But I\u0027m enjoying it.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I don\u0027t have too much confidence in it,\" she said. \"After all those months of instant decaf.\"\\n\\n \"Well, this is a big improvement.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad. So you didn\u0027t learn anything more about Eddie? And what was on his mind?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"But then I didn\u0027t really expect to.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"Because I already knew.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t follow you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you?\" I got to my feet. \"I already knew what was on Eddie\u0027s mind, and what happened to him. Mrs. Hoeldtke just now told me that she knew all along that her daughter was dead, that the knowledge had to have existed on some level. I knew about Eddie on a more conscious level than the one she was talking about, but I didn\u0027t want to know about it. I tried to shut out the knowledge, and I went out there hoping I\u0027d learn something that would prove me wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Wrong about what?\"\\n\\n \"Wrong about what was eating at him. Wrong about how he got killed.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it was autoerotic asphyxiation.\" She frowned. \"Or are you saying that it was actually suicide? That he really had the intention of killing himself?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Your mother is on the roof.\u0027 \" She looked at me. \"I can\u0027t break it gently, Willa. I know what happened and I know why. You killed him.\"\\n\\n \"It was the chloral hydrate,\" I said. \"And the funny thing is it wouldn\u0027t have flagged anybody\u0027s attention but mine. He only had a very small dose of chloral in him, not enough to have any pronounced effect on him. Certainly not enough to kill him.\\n\\n \"But he was a sober alcoholic, and that meant he shouldn\u0027t have any chloral hydrate in him. As far as Eddie was concerned, sobriety was unequivocal. It meant no alcohol and no mood-changing or sedative drugs. He\u0027d tried dicking around with marijuana shortly after he came into the program and he knew that didn\u0027t work. He wouldn\u0027t take something to help him sleep, not even one of those over-the-counter preparations, let alone a real drug like chloral hydrate. If he couldn\u0027t sleep he\u0027d have stayed awake. Nobody ever died from lack of sleep. That\u0027s what they tell you when you first get sober, and God knows I heard it enough myself. \u0027Nobody ever died from lack of sleep.\u0027 Sometimes I wanted to throw a chair at the person who said it, but it turned out they were right.\"\\n\\n She was standing with her back to the refrigerator, one hand pressed palm-first against the white surface.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d wanted to find out if he died sober,\" I went on. \"It seemed important to me, maybe because it would have been his one victory in a life that had been nothing but a chain of small defeats. And when I learned about the chloral I couldn\u0027t let go of it. I went up to his apartment and I gave it a pretty decent search. If he\u0027d had any pills there, I think I would have found them. Then I came downstairs and found a bottle of chloral hydrate in your medicine cabinet.\"\\n\\n \"He said he couldn\u0027t sleep, that he was going nuts. He wouldn\u0027t take a drink or a bottle of beer so I gave him a couple of drops in a cup of coffee.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s no good, Willa. I gave you a chance to tell me that after I searched his place.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you made such a big deal out of it. You made it sound as though giving a sedative to an alcoholic was like giving apples with razor blades in them to Halloween trick-or-treaters. I sort of hinted at it. I said he might have bought a pill on the street, or somebody might have given him one.\"\\n\\n \"Coral hydrate.\"\\n\\n She looked at me.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what you called it. We had a conversation about it, and you were very good about getting the name of the drug wrong, as though this were the first time you were hearing about it. That was a nice touch, casual as could be, but the timing wasn\u0027t so good. Because I was hearing it all just a few minutes after seeing a bottle of liquid chloral in your medicine chest.\"\\n\\n \"I just knew it was something to take to go to sleep. I didn\u0027t know the name of it.\"\\n\\n \"It was typed right on the label.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I never read it properly in the first place. Maybe it never registered, maybe I haven\u0027t got a mind for that kind of detail.\"\\n\\n \"You? The woman who knew what Paris green was? The woman who would know how to poison a municipal water system if the word came down from the party leadership?\"\\n\\n \"Then maybe it was just a slip of the tongue.\"\\n\\n \"Just a slip of the tongue. And then, the next time I looked, the bottle was gone from the medicine cabinet.\"\\n\\n She sighed. \"I can explain. It\u0027s going to make me sound stupid, but I can explain.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hear it.\"\\n\\n \"I gave him the chloral hydrate. I didn\u0027t know any reason not to, for God\u0027s sake. He came in to talk and he wasn\u0027t going to have any coffee because he told me he was having a terrible time sleeping. I guess there was something on his mind, the same thing he was going to tell you about, but he didn\u0027t give any indication what it was.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"I told him decaf wouldn\u0027t keep him awake, and that this particular brand seemed to help people to sleep, at least it had that effect on me. And then I put a couple of drops of the chloral hydrate in his cup but didn\u0027t let him know what I was doing. And he drank it right down and went up to bed, and the next time I saw him was when I walked in there with you and he was dead.\"\\n\\n \"And the reason you didn\u0027t say anything-\"\\n\\n \"Was because I thought I\u0027d killed him! I thought the dose I gave him made him drowsy, and then as a result he lost consciousness while he was half strangling himself, and that was why he died. And by this time you and I were sleeping together, and I was terrified you\u0027d hold it against me, I knew what a fanatic you are about sobriety, and I couldn\u0027t see what purpose it would serve to admit that I\u0027d done something that might have contributed to his death.\" She held her hands at her sides. \"That may make me guilty of something, Matt. But it doesn\u0027t mean I killed him.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Do you see, darling? Do you see what-\"\\n\\n \"What I\u0027m beginning to see is how good you are at improvisation. I suppose you had good training, living under false colors for all those years, putting up one front after another for your neighbors and co-workers. It must have been a great education.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re talking about the lies I told earlier. I\u0027m not proud of that but I guess it\u0027s true. I guess I\u0027ve learned to lie as a reflex. And now I have to learn a new way of behavior, now that I\u0027m involved with someone who\u0027s really important to me. It\u0027s a different ball game now, isn\u0027t it, and I-\"\\n\\n \"Cut the shit, Willa.\"\\n\\n She recoiled as if from a blow. \"It won\u0027t work,\" I told her. \"You didn\u0027t just slip him a Mickey. You knotted the clothesline around the neck and hanged him from the pipe. It wouldn\u0027t have been hard for you to do. You\u0027re a big strong woman and he was a little guy, and he wouldn\u0027t have put up a fight once you\u0027d knocked him out with the chloral. You set the stage nicely, you stripped him, you put a couple of bondage magazines where they\u0027d tell a good story. Where did you buy the magazines? Times Square?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t buy the magazines. I didn\u0027t do any of the things you just said.\"\\n\\n \"One of the clerks down there might remember you. You\u0027re a striking woman, and they don\u0027t get that many female customers in the first place. I don\u0027t suppose it would take a whole lot of legwork to turn up a clerk who remembers you.\"\\n\\n \"Matt, if you could hear yourself. The awful things you\u0027re accusing me of. I know you\u0027re tired, I know the kind of day you\u0027ve had, but-\"\\n\\n \"I told you to cut the crap. I know you killed him, Willa. You closed the windows to hold the smell in a little longer, to make the medical evidence a little less precise. Then you waited for someone to notice the stench and report it, to you or to the cops. You were in no hurry. You didn\u0027t really care how long it took before the body was discovered. What mattered was that he was dead. That way his secret could die with him.\"\\n\\n \"What secret?\"\\n\\n \"The one he had trouble living with. The one you didn\u0027t dare let him tell me. About all the other people you killed.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Poor Mrs. Mangan. All her old friends are dying while she sits around waiting for her own death. And the ones who don\u0027t die are moving away. There was a landlord around the corner who moved junkies into the building so that they would terrorize his rent-controlled tenants. He got fined for it. He should have gone to jail, the son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n She looked right at me. It was hard to read her face, hard to guess what was going on behind it.\\n\\n \"But a lot of people have been moving out of the neighborhood willingly,\" I went on. \"Their landlords buy them out, offer them five or ten or twenty thousand dollars to give up their apartments. It must confuse the hell out of them, to get offered more to vacate an apartment than they\u0027ve paid all their lives to live in it. Of course, once they take the money, they can\u0027t find a place they can afford to live in.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the system.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a funny system. You pay steady rent on a couple of rooms for twenty or thirty years and the guy who owns the building pays a small fortune to get rid of you. You\u0027d think he\u0027d want to hang on to a good steady tenant, but then the same kind of thing happens in business. Companies pay their best employees big bonuses to take early retirement and get the hell out. That way they can replace them with young kids who\u0027ll work for lower salaries. You wouldn\u0027t think it would work that way, but it does.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re getting at.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you? I managed to get hold of the autopsy report on Gertrude Grod. She had the apartment directly above Eddie\u0027s, and she died right around the time he was starting to get sober. She had just about as much chloral hydrate in her as Eddie did. And her physician never prescribed the drug for her, and neither did anyone on staff at Roosevelt or St. Clare\u0027s. I figure you knocked on her door and got her to invite you in for a cup of tea, and when she was looking the other way you dosed her cup. On your way out you could have made sure the window gates were unlocked, so that Eddie could slip in a few hours later with a knife.\"\\n\\n \"Why would he do this for me?\"\\n\\n \"My guess is you had a sexual hold on him, but it could have been anything. He was just starting to get sober and he wasn\u0027t a model of mental health at the time. And you\u0027re pretty good at getting people to do what you want them to do. You probably convinced Eddie he\u0027d be doing the old lady a favor. I\u0027ve heard you rap on the subject, how nobody should have to grow old that way. And she\u0027d never know what happened to her, the drug would keep her from waking up, and so she\u0027d never feel a thing. All he had to do was go out his window, climb up a flight, and stick a knife into a sleeping woman.\"\\n\\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t I just knife her myself? If I was already in her apartment and I got her to drink a dose of chloral.\"\\n\\n \"You wanted it to go in the books as a burglary. Eddie could make it a lot more convincing. He could lock her door from the inside and put the chain latch on before he went back out the window. I saw the police report. They had to break the door down. That was a nice touch, made it look a lot less like a possible inside job.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-32.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) \\n It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
