I told her Ginny had said that Paula had seemed vulnerable. \"They\u0027re all vulnerable,\" she said. I called Paula\u0027s acting classmates, saw some of them face to face, spoke with others on the phone. I worked my way through Kelly Greer\u0027s list, and at the same time I kept knocking on doors at Flo Edderling\u0027s rooming house, crossing off names on my list of uninterviewed tenants. I went, as my client had previously gone, to the restaurant that was Paula\u0027s last known place of employment. It was called the Druid\u0027s Castle, and it was an English pub-style place on West Forty-sixth. They had dishes like shepherd\u0027s pie on the menu, and something called toad-in-the-hole. The manager confirmed that she\u0027d left in the spring. \"She was all right,\" he said. \"I forget why she quit, but we parted on good terms. I\u0027d hire her again.\" There was a waitress who remembered Paula as \"a good kid but sort of spacey, like she didn\u0027t really have her mind on what she was doing.\" I walked in and out of a lot of restaurants in the Forties and Fifties, and two of them did turn out to be places where Paula had worked prior to her stint at the Druid\u0027s Castle. This was information that might have been useful if I\u0027d planned on writing her biography, but it didn\u0027t tell me much about where she\u0027d gone in mid-July. In a bar at Ninth and Fifty-second, a place called Paris Green, the manager allowed that she looked familiar but said she\u0027d never worked there. The bartender, a lanky fellow with a beard like an oriole\u0027s nest, asked if he could see her picture. \"She never worked here,\" he said, \"but she used to come in here. Not in the past couple of months, though.\" \"In the spring?\" \"Had to be since April because that\u0027s when I started here. What was her name again?\" \"Paula.\" He tapped the photo. \"I don\u0027t remember the name, but this is her. I must have seen her in here five, six times. Late. She came in late. We close at two, and it was generally close to that when she came in. Past midnight, anyway.\" \"Was she alone?\" \"Couldn\u0027t have been or I would have hit on her.\" He grinned. \"Or at least volleyed, you know? She was with a guy, but was it the same guy every time? I think so but I couldn\u0027t swear to it. You have to remember that I never gave her a thought since the last time I saw her, and that\u0027s got to be two months ago.\" \"She was last seen the first week in July.\" \"That sounds about right, give or take a week or two. Last time I saw her she was drinking salty dogs, they were both drinking salty dogs.\" \"What did she usually drink?\" \"Different things. Margaritas, vodka sours, maybe not that exactly but you get the general idea. Girl drinks. But he was a whiskey drinker and for a change he ordered up a saline canine, and what does that tell me?\" \"It was hot out.\" \"On the nose, my dear Watson.\" He grinned again. \"Either I\u0027d make a good detective or you\u0027d make a good bartender, because we both got the same place with that one. Can I buy you a drink on the strength of that?\" \"Make it a Coke.\" He drew a beer for himself and a Coke for me. He took a small sip of his and asked what had happened to Paula. I said she\u0027d disappeared. \"People\u0027ll do that,\" he said. I worked with him for ten minutes or so, and by the time I was through I had a description of Paula\u0027s escort. My height, maybe a little taller. Around thirty. Dark hair, no beard or moustache. A casual dresser, a sort of outdoors type. \"Like retrieving lost data from a computer,\" he said, marveling at the process. \"I\u0027m remembering things I never even knew I knew. The only thing that bothers me is the thought that I might be making some of this up without meaning to, just to be obliging.\" \"Sometimes that happens,\" I admitted. \"Anyway, the description I gave you would fit half the men in the neighborhood. If he was even from the neighborhood, which I doubt.\" \"You only saw him the five or six times he was with her.\" He nodded. \"Add that to the hour they came in, I\u0027d say he picked her up after work or she picked him up after work, or maybe they both worked at the same place.\" \"And stopped here for a quick one.\" \"More than one.\" \"Was she a heavy hitter?\" \"He was. She sipped, but she didn\u0027t dawdle. Her drinks didn\u0027t just evaporate. She didn\u0027t show the booze, though. Neither did he. More evidence they worked someplace, and started their drinking here rather than finished it.\" He extended the photo. I told him to keep it. \"And if you think of anything-\" \"I\u0027ll call the number.\" Dribs and drabs, bits and pieces. By the time I told my story at Fresh Start I\u0027d spent over a week looking for Paula Hoeldtke, and I\u0027d probably given her father a thousand dollars\u0027 worth of time and shoe leather, even if I couldn\u0027t point to a thousand dollars\u0027 worth of results. I\u0027d talked to dozens of people and I had pages and pages of notes. I\u0027d given out half of the hundred photos I\u0027d had made up. What had I learned? I couldn\u0027t account for her movements after she\u0027d disappeared from her rooming house in the middle of July. I couldn\u0027t turn up any evidence of employment subsequent to the waitress job she\u0027d left in April. And the picture I was beginning to develop was a good deal less sharply focused than the one I was handing out all over the neighborhood. She was an actress, or wanted to be one, but she\u0027d barely worked at all and had evidently stopped going to classes. She\u0027d been in a man\u0027s company at a local drinking establishment, late in the evening, perhaps half a dozen times in all. She\u0027d been a loner, but she hadn\u0027t spent much time in her room. Where did she go by her lonesome? Did she walk in the park? Did she talk to the pigeons? My first thought the next morning was that I\u0027d been too abrupt with my mystery caller. He wasn\u0027t much, but what else did I have? Over breakfast, I reminded myself that I hadn\u0027t really expected to come up with anything. Paula Hoeldtke had dropped out of actressing and waitressing. Then she\u0027d dropped out of Florence Edderling\u0027s house and out of her role as her parents\u0027 daughter. By now she was probably settled into some new life, and she\u0027d surface when she wanted to. Or she was dead, in which case there wasn\u0027t a whole lot I could do for her. I thought I\u0027d go to a movie, but instead I wound up spending the day talking to theatrical agents, asking the same old questions, passing out pictures. None of them recognized the name or the face. \"She probably just went to open auditions,\" one of them told me. \"Some of them look for an agent right away, others buy the trades and go to the cattle calls and try to get a few credits so they have something to impress an agent with.\" \"What\u0027s the best way?\" \"The best way? Have an uncle in the business, that\u0027s the best way.\" I got tired of talking to agents and tried the rooming house again. I rang Florence Edderling\u0027s bell and she shook her head as she let me in. \"I ought to start collecting rent from you,\" she said. \"You spend more time here than some of my tenants.\" \"I\u0027ve just got a few more people to see.\" \"Take all the time you want. Nobody\u0027s complained, and if they don\u0027t mind I sure don\u0027t.\" Of the tenants I hadn\u0027t yet interviewed, only one was on the premises. She\u0027d lived in the building since May and didn\u0027t know Paula Hoeldtke at all. \"I wish I could help,\" she said, \"but she doesn\u0027t even look familiar to me. My neighbor across the hall said she\u0027d talked to you, that this girl disappeared or something?\" \"It looks that way.\" She shrugged. \"I wish I could help.\" When I was first getting sober I started keeping company with a woman named Jan Keane. I\u0027d known her before, but we\u0027d stopped seeing each other when she joined AA and took up again when I started coming to meetings. She\u0027s a sculptor, living and working in a loft on Lispenard Street, which is in TriBeCa, just south of Canal Street. We began spending a fair amount of time together, seeing each other three or four nights a week, occasionally getting together during the day. Sometimes we went to meetings together, but we did other things as well. We\u0027d go out to dinner, or she would cook for me. She liked to go to galleries, in SoHo or the East Village. This was something I\u0027d never done much of, and I discovered I enjoyed it. I\u0027d always been a little self-conscious in situations like that, never knowing what to say when confronted by a painting or a piece of sculpture, and from her I\u0027d learned that it was perfectly acceptable not to say anything at all. I don\u0027t know what went wrong. The relationship escalated slightly, as relationships do, and we reached a point where I was half living on Lispenard Street, with some of my clothes in her closet and my socks and underwear in one of her dresser drawers. We had conversations in which we speculated gingerly on the wisdom of my maintaining my room at the hotel. Wasn\u0027t it a waste to pay rent when I was hardly ever there? On the other hand, was it perhaps valuable as a place to meet clients? There was a point, I suppose, when it was appropriate for me to give up my room and begin paying my share of the expenses at the loft. And there was a point, too, where we might have gone on to talk about commitment and permanence and, I suppose, marriage. But we didn\u0027t do any of this, and, having left it undone, it became impossible for things to remain as they had been. We disengaged gradually, in little fits and starts. Our times together were increasingly marked by moods and silences, and our times apart became more frequent. We decided- I honestly forget who suggested it- that we ought to see other people. We did, and subsequently found that made us that much more uncomfortable with each other. And at last, gently, and with a surprising lack of drama, I returned a couple of books she had lent me and retrieved the last of my clothing, and I took a cab uptown, and that was that. It had dragged on long enough for the ending to be something of a relief, but even so I felt lonely a lot of the time, and possessed of a sense of loss. I\u0027d felt less at the breakup of my marriage some years previously, but of course I was drinking then, so I didn\u0027t really feel anything. So I went to a lot of meetings, and sometimes I talked about what I was feeling at meetings, and sometimes I kept it to myself. I had tried dating shortly after the breakup, but I didn\u0027t seem to have the heart for it. Now I was beginning to think that it might be time for me to start seeing women again, or a woman. I kept having the thought, but I hadn\u0027t yet reached the point of acting on it. All of which put a curious spin on the business of going door-to-door in a West Side rooming house and making conversation with single women. Most of them were a little young for me, but not all of them were. And there is something about the kind of interview I was conducting that facilitates flirtation. I\u0027d learned this when I was a cop, and a married one at that. Sometimes, asking my endless questions about the elusive Paula Hoeldtke, I would be aware of a strong attraction to the woman I was questioning. Sometimes I sensed, too, that the current ran in both directions, that the attraction was reciprocal. I wrote little mental scripts, moving us toward emotional intimacy, and from the doorway to the bed. But I could never bring myself to take the next step. I felt out of sync, and by the time I left the rooming house, having talked to six or ten or a dozen people, my mood had darkened and I felt unutterably alone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-7.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
