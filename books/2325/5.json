That\u0027s up one flight.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose it\u0027s still vacant.\" She laughed. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you I didn\u0027t have any vacancies? I don\u0027t think it was more than a day before I rented it. Let me see. The Price girl took that room on the eighteenth of July. When did I say Paula moved out?\" \"We\u0027re not sure, but it was the sixteenth when you found out she was gone.\" \"Well, there you are. Vacant the sixteenth, rented the eighteenth. Probably rented the seventeenth, and she moved in the following day. My vacancies don\u0027t last any time to speak of. I\u0027ve got a waiting list right now with half a dozen names on it.\" \"You say the new tenant\u0027s name is Price?\" \"Georgia Price. She\u0027s a dancer. A lot of them are dancers the past year or so.\" \"I think I\u0027ll see if she\u0027s in.\" I gave her one of the photos. \"If you think of anything,\" I said, \"my number\u0027s on the back.\" She said, \"That\u0027s Paula. It\u0027s a good likeness. Your name is Scudder? Here, just a minute, you can have one of my cards.\" Florence Edderling, her business card said. Rooms to Let. \"People call me Flo,\" she said. \"Or Florence, it doesn\u0027t matter.\" Georgia Price wasn\u0027t in, and I\u0027d knocked on enough doors for the day. I bought a sandwich at a deli and ate it on the way to my meeting. The next morning I took Warren Hoeldtke\u0027s check to the bank and drew out some cash, including a hundred in singles. I kept a supply of them loose in my right front trouser pocket. You couldn\u0027t go anywhere without being asked for money. Sometimes I shook them off. Sometimes I reached into my pocket and handed over a dollar. Some years back I had quit the police force and left my wife and sons and moved into my hotel. It was around that time that I started tithing, giving a tenth of whatever income I received to whatever house of worship I happened to visit next. I had taken to hanging out in churches a lot. I don\u0027t know what I was looking for there and I can\u0027t say whether or not I found it, but it seemed somehow appropriate for me to pay out ten percent of my earnings for whatever it gave me. After I sobered up I went on tithing for a while, but it no longer felt right and I stopped. That didn\u0027t feel right either. My first impulse was to give the money to AA, but AA didn\u0027t want donations. They pass the hat to cover expenses, but a dollar a meeting is about as much as they want from you. So I\u0027d started giving the money away to the people who were coming out on the streets and asking for it. I didn\u0027t seem to be comfortable keeping it for myself, and I hadn\u0027t yet thought of a better thing to do with it. I\u0027m sure some of the people spent my handouts on drink and drugs, and why not? You spend your money on what you need the most. At first I found myself trying to screen the beggars, but I didn\u0027t do that for long. On the one hand it seemed presumptuous of me, and at the same time it felt too much like work, a form of instant detection. When I gave the money to churches I hadn\u0027t bothered to find out what they were doing with it, or whether or not I approved. I\u0027d been willing then for my largesse to purchase Cadillacs for monsignors. Why shouldn\u0027t I be as willing now to underwrite Porsches for crack dealers? While I was in a giving mood, I walked over to Midtown North and handed fifty dollars to Detective Joseph Durkin. I\u0027d called ahead, so he was in the squadroom waiting for me. It had been a year or more since I\u0027d seen him but he looked the same. He\u0027d put on a couple of pounds, no more than he could carry. The booze was starting to show up in his face, but that\u0027s no reason to quit. Who ever stopped drinking because of a few broken blood vessels, a little bloom in the cheeks? He said, \"I wondered if that Honda dealer\u0027d get hold of you. He had a German name but I don\u0027t remember it.\" \"Hoeldtke. And it\u0027s Subarus, not Hondas.\" \"That\u0027s a real important distinction, Matt. How\u0027re you doing, anyway?\" \"Not bad.\" \"You look good. Clean living, right?\" \"That\u0027s my secret.\" \"Early hours? Plenty of fiber in your diet?\" \"Sometimes I go to the park and gnaw the bark right off a tree.\" \"Me too. I just can\u0027t help myself.\" He reached up a hand and smoothed his hair back. It was dark brown, close to black, and it hadn\u0027t needed smoothing; it lay flat against his scalp the way he\u0027d combed it. \"It\u0027s good to see you, you know that?\" \"Good to see you, Joe.\" We shook hands. I had palmed a ten and two twenties, and they moved from my hand to his during the handshake. His hand disappeared from view and came up empty. He said, \"I gather you did yourself a little good with him.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I took some money from him and I\u0027ll knock on some doors. I don\u0027t know what good it\u0027s going to do.\" \"You put his mind at rest, that\u0027s all. At least he\u0027s doing all he can, you know? And you won\u0027t soak him.\" \"No.\" \"I took a picture from him and had them run it at the morgue. They had a couple of unidentified white females since June, but she doesn\u0027t match up to any of \u0027em.\" \"I figured you\u0027d done that.\" \"Yeah, well, that\u0027s all I did. It\u0027s not police business.\" \"I know.\" \"Which is why I referred him to you.\" \"I know, and I appreciate it.\" \"My pleasure. You got any sense of it yet?\" \"It\u0027s a little early. One thing, she moved out. Packed everything and took off.\" \"Well, that\u0027s good,\" he said. \"Makes it a little more likely she\u0027s alive.\" \"I know, but there are things that don\u0027t make sense. You said you checked the morgue. What about hospitals?\" \"You thinking coma?\" \"It could be.\" \"When\u0027d they hear from her last, sometime in June? That\u0027s a long time to be in a coma.\" \"Sometimes they\u0027re out for years.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s true.\" \"And she paid her rent the last time on the sixth of July. So what\u0027s that, two months and a few days.\" \"Still a long time.\" \"Not for the person in the coma. It\u0027s like the wink of an eye.\" He looked at me. He had pale gray eyes that don\u0027t show you much, but they showed a little grudging amusement now. \" \u0027The wink of an eye,\u0027 \" he said. \"First she checks out of her rooming house, then she checks into a hospital.\" \"All it takes is a coincidence,\" I said. \"She moves, and in the course of the move or a day or two later she has an accident. No ID, some public-spirited citizen snags her purse while she\u0027s unconscious, and she\u0027s Jane Doe in a ward somewhere. She didn\u0027t call her parents and tell them she was moving because the accident happened first. I\u0027m not saying it happened, just that it could have.\" \"I suppose. You checking hospitals?\" \"I thought I could walk over to the ones in the neighborhood. Roosevelt, St. Clare\u0027s.\" \"Of course the accident could have happened anywhere.\" \"I know.\" \"If she moved, she could have moved anywhere, so she could be in any hospital anywhere in the city.\" \"I was thinking that myself.\" He gave me a look. \"I suppose you\u0027ve got some extra pictures. Oh, that\u0027s handy, with your number on the back. I suppose you wouldn\u0027t mind if I sent these around for you, asked them all to check their Jane Does.\" \"That would be very helpful,\" I said. \"I bet it would. You expect a lot for the price of a coat.\" A coat, in police parlance, is a hundred dollars. A hat is twenty-five. A pound is five. The terms took hold years ago, when clothing was cheaper than it is now, and British currency pegged higher. I said, \"You\u0027d better look closer. All you got was a couple of hats.\" \"Jesus,\" he said. \"You\u0027re a cheap bastard, anybody ever tell you that?\" She wasn\u0027t in a hospital, not in the five boroughs, at any rate. I hadn\u0027t expected she would be, but it was the kind of thing that had to be checked. While I was learning this through Durkin\u0027s channels, I was walking down other streets on my own. Over the next several days I made a few more visits to Florence Edderling\u0027s rooming house, where I knocked on more doors and talked to more tenants when I found them in. There were men as well as women in the building, old people as well as young ones, New Yorkers as well as out-of-towners, but the bulk of Ms. Edderling\u0027s roomers were like Paula Hoeldtke- young women, relatively new in the city, long on hope and short on cash. Few of them knew Paula by name, although most of them recognized her picture, or thought they did. Like her, they spent most of their time away from the rooming house, and when they were in their rooms they were alone, with their doors closed. \"I thought this would be like those forties movies,\" one girl told me, \"with a wisecracking landlady and kids gathering in the parlor to talk about boyfriends and auditions and do each other\u0027s hair. Well, there used to be a parlor, but they partitioned it years ago and made two rooms out of it and rented them out. There are people I nod to and smile at, but I don\u0027t really know a single person in this building. I used to see this girl- Paula? But I never knew her name, and I didn\u0027t even know she\u0027d moved out.\" One morning I went over to the Actors Equity office, where I managed to establish that Paula Hoeldtke hadn\u0027t been a member of that organization. The young man who checked the listings asked me if she\u0027d been a member of AFTRA or SAG; when I said I didn\u0027t know, he was nice enough to call the two unions for me. Neither of them had her name on their rolls. \"Unless she used another name,\" he said. \"Her name\u0027s not utterly impossible, in fact it looks good in print, but it\u0027s the sort of name a great many people would mispronounce, or at least be uncertain about. Do you suppose she went and changed it to Paula Holden or something manageable like that?\" \"She didn\u0027t say anything about it to her parents.\" \"It\u0027s not always the sort of thing you rush to report to your parents, especially if they have a strong attachment to their name. As parents often do.\" \"I suppose you\u0027re right. But she used her own name in the two shows she was in.\" \"May I see that?\" He took the playbills from me. \"Oh, now this might be helpful. Yes, here we are, Paula Hoeldtke. Am I pronouncing it correctly?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good. Actually I can\u0027t think how else you would pronounce it, but one feels uncertain. She could have just spelled it differently, H-O-L-T-K-Y. But that wouldn\u0027t look right, would it? Let\u0027s see. \u0027Paula Hoeldtke majored in theater arts at Ball State University \u0027- oh, the poor darling- \u0027where she appeared in The Flowering Peach and Gregory\u0027s Garden.\u0027 The Flowering Peach is Odets, but what the hell do you suppose Gregory\u0027s Garden might be? Student work, that would be my guess. And that is all they\u0027re going to tell us about Paula Hoeldtke. What is this, anyway? Another Part of Town, what a curious choice for a showcase. She played Molly. I barely remember the play, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a principal role.\" \"She told her parents she had a small part.\" \"I don\u0027t think she exaggerated. Was there anyone in this? Hmmm. \u0027Axel Godine appears with the permission of Actors Equity.\u0027 I don\u0027t know who he is, but I can furnish you with his phone number. He played Oliver, so he\u0027s probably well up in years, but you never know in a showcase, the casting sometimes tends to be imaginative. Does she like older men?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-5.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
