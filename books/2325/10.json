The phone doesn\u0027t work and I\u0027ve never called him anyway. We go to different meetings, so I never see him, either.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s his name?\"\\n\\n \"Dave. I don\u0027t know his last name, and I have to say I\u0027m beginning to forget what he looks like, it\u0027s so long since I saw him. But I\u0027ve never yet thrown his number away, so I guess he\u0027s still my sponsor. I mean, I could call him if I had to, right?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"I could even take the step with him.\"\\n\\n \"If you felt comfortable with him.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even know him. Do you have anybody that you sponsor, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You ever hear anybody\u0027s fifth step?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n There was a bottle cap on the sidewalk and he kicked at it. \"Because I guess that\u0027s what I\u0027m leading up to. I can\u0027t believe it, a crook looking to confess to a cop. Of course you\u0027re not with the department no more, but would you still, you know, be bound to report anything I said?\"\\n\\n \"No. I wouldn\u0027t have the legal right to withhold information, the way a priest or a lawyer might, but that\u0027s how I\u0027d treat it. As privileged information.\"\\n\\n \"Would you be willing? It\u0027d be a whole load of shit once I got started, you might not want to sit through it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll force myself.\"\\n\\n \"I feel funny asking.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I felt the same way.\"\\n\\n \"If it was just me involved,\" he began, then broke off the sentence. He said, \"What I want to do, I want to take a couple of days, sort things out in my mind, think some things through. Then if you\u0027re still willing we can get together and I can talk some. If that\u0027s all right with you.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no hurry,\" I told him. \"Wait until you\u0027re ready.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"If I wait till I\u0027m ready I\u0027ll never do it. Gimme the weekend to sort it out and then we\u0027ll sit down and do it.\"\\n\\n \"Sorting it out is part of it. Take all the time you need.\"\\n\\n \"I been doing that,\" he said. He grinned, put a hand on my shoulder. \"Thanks, Matt. That\u0027s my block coming up and I think I\u0027ll say good night.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Night, Eddie.\"\\n\\n \"Have a good weekend.\"\\n\\n \"You too. Maybe I\u0027ll run into you at a meeting.\"\\n\\n \" St. Paul \u0027s is just Monday through Friday, right? I\u0027ll probably get there Monday night, anyway. Matt? Thanks again.\"\\n\\n He headed for his building. I walked up a block on Tenth, walked east on one of the cross streets. A few doors from the corner of Ninth Avenue, three young men in a doorway went silent at my approach. Their eyes followed me all the way to the corner, and I could feel their stares like darts between my shoulder blades.\\n\\n Halfway home a hooker asked me if I felt like partying. She looked young and fresh, but they mostly do these days; drugs and viruses keep them from lasting long enough to fade.\\n\\n I told her we\u0027d have to make it some other time. Her smile, at least as enigmatic as the Mona Lisa\u0027s, stayed with me all the way home. At Fifty-sixth Street a black man, bare to the waist, asked me for spare change. Half a block farther, a woman stepped out of the shadows and made the same request. She had lank blond hair and the face of an Okie out of one of those Depression photographs. They each got a dollar from me.\\n\\n There were no messages at the hotel desk. I went up to my room and took a shower and got into bed.\\n\\n Some years back three brothers named Morrissey owned a small four-story brick building on West Fifty-first half a block from the river. They lived in the top two stories, rented out the ground floor to an Irish amateur theater, and sold beer and whiskey after hours on the second floor. There was a time when I went there a lot, and there may have been half a dozen occasions when Mickey Ballou and I were there at the same time. I don\u0027t know that we ever exchanged a word, but I remember seeing him there, and knowing who he was.\\n\\n My friend Skip Devoe had said of Ballou that, if he had ten brothers and they all stood around in a circle, you\u0027d think you were at Stonehenge. Ballou had that megalithic quality, and he had too an air of wild menace just held in check. There was a man named Aronow, a manufacturer of women\u0027s dresses, who one night spilled a drink on Ballou. Aronow\u0027s apology was immediate and profuse, and Ballou mopped himself up and told Aronow to forget it, and Aronow left town and didn\u0027t come back for a month. He didn\u0027t even go home and pack, he took a cab straight to the airport and was on a flight within the hour. He was, we all agreed, a cautious man, but not overly cautious.\\n\\n Lying there, waiting for sleep to come, I wondered what was on Eddie\u0027s mind and what it might have to do with the Butcher Boy. I didn\u0027t stay up late worrying about it, though. I figured I\u0027d find out soon enough.\\n\\n The good weather held all weekend. Saturday I went to a ball game. The Mets and the Yankees had both had a shot at it. The Mets were still leading their division, in spite of the fact that nobody was hitting. The Yankees had slipped to six or seven out and it didn\u0027t look as though they were going to turn it around. That weekend the Mets were in Houston for three games with the Astros. The Yankees were coming to the end of a home stand, hosting the Mariners, and I got to see Mattingly win it with a double down the line in the eleventh.\\n\\n Coming home, I stayed on past my stop and rode down to the Village. I had dinner at an Italian place on Thompson Street, caught a meeting, made an early night of it.\\n\\n Sunday I went over to Jim Faber\u0027s apartment and watched the Mets on the cable sports channel. Gooden held the Astros to three scratch hits through eight innings, but the Mets couldn\u0027t get any runs across for him, and Johnson pulled him in the top of the ninth for a pinch hitter, Mazzilli, who promptly flied out to deep short. \"I think that was a mistake,\" Jim said softly, and in the bottom of the ninth the Houston second baseman walked, stole second, and scored on a sharp single through the middle.\\n\\n We ate at a Chinese restaurant Jim had been wanting to try, then went to a meeting at Roosevelt Hospital. The speaker was a shy woman with an expressionless face and a voice that didn\u0027t carry past the first two rows. We were in the back and it was impossible to hear a word. I gave up trying and let my mind wander. I started thinking about the game and wound up thinking about Jan Keane and how she\u0027d enjoyed going to ball games even though she had only a vague notion of what they were doing out there on the field. She told me once that she liked the perfect geometry of the game.\\n\\n I took her to the fights once but she hadn\u0027t cared for that. She said she found it all exhausting to watch. But she loved hockey. She had never seen a match until we went together, and she wound up liking it far more than I do.\\n\\n I was glad when the meeting ended, and I went straight home afterward. I didn\u0027t feel like being around people.\\n\\n Monday morning I earned a couple of dollars. A woman who\u0027d sobered up at St. Paul \u0027s had moved in a few months ago with a fellow in Rego Park. He\u0027d been sober at the time, but he\u0027d slipped around for years, drifting in and out of the program, and he picked up a drink again shortly after they set up housekeeping. It took six or eight weeks and one good beating for her to realize that she\u0027d made a mistake and that she didn\u0027t have to go on taking it, and she\u0027d moved back to the city.\\n\\n But she\u0027d left some things at the apartment and she was afraid to go back there by herself. She asked what I would charge to ride shotgun.\\n\\n I told her she didn\u0027t have to pay me. \"No, I think I should,\" she said. \"This isn\u0027t just an AA favor. He\u0027s a violent son of a bitch when he drinks, and I don\u0027t want to go out there without someone who\u0027s professionally qualified to deal with that sort of thing. I can afford to pay you and I\u0027ll be more comfortable doing it that way.\"\\n\\n She arranged for a cabbie named Jack Odegaard to run us out and back. I knew him from meetings, but I hadn\u0027t known his last name until I read it on the hack license posted over the glove box.\\n\\n Her name was Rosalind Klein. The boyfriend\u0027s name was Vince Broglio, and he wasn\u0027t a terribly violent son of a bitch that afternoon. He mostly just sat around chuckling ironically to himself and sucking on a longneck Stroh\u0027s while Roz packed up a couple of suitcases and a brace of shopping bags. He was watching game shows on TV, using the remote control to hop back and forth between the channels. The whole apartment was littered with boxes of half-eaten pizza from Domino\u0027s and those little white cartons of takeout food from Chinese restaurants. And empty beer and whiskey bottles. And overflowing ashtrays, and empty cigarette packs wadded up and tossed into corners.\\n\\n At one point he said, \"You my replacement? The new boyfriend?\"\\n\\n \"Just along for the ride.\"\\n\\n He laughed at that. \"Aren\u0027t we all? Along for the ride, I mean.\"\\n\\n A few minutes later, without taking his eyes off the Sony, he said, \"Women.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" I said.\\n\\n \"If they didn\u0027t have pussies there\u0027d be a bounty on \u0027em.\" I didn\u0027t say anything, and he glanced my way, looking to read my expression. \"Now that,\" he said, \"might be construed to be a sexist remark.\" He had a little trouble getting his tongue around construed; and he got interested in the word and let go of his original train of thought. \"Construed,\" he said. \"I gotta get construed, blewed and tattooed. My whole problem, see, is I got misconstrued once. How\u0027s that for a problem?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a pretty good one.\"\\n\\n \"Let me tell you something,\" he said. \"She\u0027s the one with a problem.\"\\n\\n Jack Odegaard drove us back to the city, and he and I helped Roz get her stuff into her apartment. Before the move she\u0027d lived on Fifty-seventh a few doors from Eighth Avenue. Now she was in a high-rise at Seventieth and West End. \"I had a big one-bedroom,\" she said, \"and now I\u0027m in a studio, and my rent\u0027s more than double what it used to be. I ought to have my head examined for letting go of my old place. But I was moving into a beautiful two-bedroom in Rego Park. You saw the apartment, if you can imagine what it looked like before the shit hit the fan. And if you\u0027re going to commit to a relationship you have to show some faith in it, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n She gave Jack fifty bucks for the trip and paid me a hundred for my hazardous duty. She could afford it, just as she could handle the higher rent; she made good money working in the news department of one of the TV networks. I don\u0027t know what exactly she did there, but I gather she did it well.\\n\\n I thought I might see Eddie at St. Paul \u0027s that night but he wasn\u0027t there. Afterward I walked down to Paris Green to talk to the bartender who\u0027d recognized Paula Hoeldtke\u0027s picture. I thought he might have remembered something, but he hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n The next morning I called the telephone company and was told that Paula Hoeldtke\u0027s phone had been disconnected. I was trying to find out when this had happened and for what reason, but I had to go through channels before I could find somebody who was authorized to tell me. The service had been terminated at the customer\u0027s request, a woman told me, and then asked me to hold the line for a moment. She returned to inform me further that there was an outstanding final balance in the customer\u0027s favor. I asked how that could be; had she overpaid the final bill?\\n\\n \"She never received her final statement,\" the woman told me. \"She evidently didn\u0027t leave a forwarding address. She had put down a deposit prior to installation, and the final bill came to less than the funds on deposit. In fact-\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-10.html","bookId":2325,"book":{"id":2325,"title":"Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7)","description":"Storyline: Out on the Cutting Edge (Matthew Scudder #7) \\n It isn\u0027t called Hell\u0027s Kitchen for nothing - a gritty landscape of dark doorways and dirty alleys inhabited by crack addicts and the homeless.
