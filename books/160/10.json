{"id":4572,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"It was November. The fine weather had quite gone now, and with it much of the sweet pleasure of Jim and Liza\u0027s love. When they came out at night on the Embankment they found it cold and dreary; sometimes a light fog covered the river-banks, and made the lamps glow out dim and large; a light rain would be falling, which sent a chill into their very souls; foot passengers came along at rare intervals, holding up umbrellas, and staring straight in front of them as they hurried along in the damp and cold; a cab would pass rapidly by, splashing up the mud on each side. The benches were deserted, except, perhaps, for some poor homeless wretch who could afford no shelter, and, huddled up in a corner, with his head buried in his breast, was sleeping heavily, like a dead man. The wet mud made Liza\u0027s skirts cling about her feet, and the damp would come in and chill her legs and creep up her body, till she shivered, and for warmth pressed herself close against Jim. Sometimes they would go into the third-class waiting-rooms at Waterloo or Charing Cross and sit there, but it was not like the park or the Embankment on summer nights; they had warmth, but the heat made their wet clothes steam and smell, and the gas flared in their eyes, and they hated the people perpetually coming in and out, opening the doors and letting in a blast of cold air; they hated the noise of the guards and porters shouting out the departure of the trains, the shrill whistling of the steam-engine, the hurry and bustle and confusion. About eleven o\u0027clock, when the trains grew less frequent, they got some quietness; but then their minds were troubled, and they felt heavy, sad and miserable.\\n\\n One evening they had been sitting at Waterloo Station; it was foggy outside--a thick, yellow November fog, which filled the waiting-room, entering the lungs, and making the mouth taste nasty and the eyes smart. It was about half-past eleven, and the station was unusually quiet; a few passengers, in wraps and overcoats, were walking to and fro, waiting for the last train, and one or two porters were standing about yawning. Liza and Jim had remained for an hour in perfect silence, filled with a gloomy unhappiness, as of a great weight on their brains. Liza was sitting forward, with her elbows on her knees, resting her face on her hands.\\n\\n \u0027I wish I was straight,\u0027 she said at last, not looking up.\\n\\n \u0027Well, why won\u0027t yer come along of me altogether, an\u0027 you\u0027ll be arright then?\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027Na, that\u0027s no go; I can\u0027t do thet.\u0027 He had often asked her to live with him entirely, but she had always refused.\\n\\n \u0027You can come along of me, an\u0027 I\u0027ll tike a room in a lodgin\u0027 \u0027ouse in \u0027Olloway, an\u0027 we can live there as if we was married.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wot abaht yer work?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can get work over the other side as well as I can \u0027ere. I\u0027m abaht sick of the wy things is goin\u0027 on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So am I; but I can\u0027t leave mother.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She can come, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not when I\u0027m not married. I shouldn\u0027t like \u0027er ter know as I\u0027d--as I\u0027d gone wrong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ll marry yer. Swop me bob, I wants ter badly enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yer can\u0027t; yer married already.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thet don\u0027t matter! If I give the missus so much a week aht of my screw, she\u0027ll sign a piper ter give up all clime ter me, an\u0027 then we can get spliced. One of the men as I works with done thet, an\u0027 it was arright.\u0027\\n\\n Liza shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027Na, yer can\u0027t do thet now; it\u0027s bigamy, an\u0027 the cop tikes yer, an\u0027 yer gits twelve months\u0027 \u0027ard for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But swop me bob, Liza, I can\u0027t go on like this. Yer knows the missus--well, there ain\u0027t no bloomin\u0027 doubt abaht it, she knows as you an\u0027 me are carryin\u0027 on, an\u0027 she mikes no bones abaht lettin\u0027 me see it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She don\u0027t do thet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, she don\u0027t exactly sy it, but she sulks an\u0027 won\u0027t speak, an\u0027 then when I says anythin\u0027 she rounds on me an\u0027 calls me all the nimes she can think of. I\u0027d give \u0027er a good \u0027idin\u0027, but some\u0027ow I don\u0027t like ter! She mikes the plice a \u0027ell ter me, an\u0027 I\u0027m not goin\u0027 ter stand it no longer!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll ave ter sit it, then; yer can\u0027t chuck it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus I can, an\u0027 I would if you\u0027d come along of me. I don\u0027t believe you like me at all, Liza, or you\u0027d come.\u0027\\n\\n She turned towards him and put her arms round his neck.\\n\\n \u0027Yer know I do, old cock,\u0027 she said. \u0027I like yer better than anyone else in the world; but I can\u0027t go awy an\u0027 leave mother.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bli\u0027me me if I see why; she\u0027s never been much ter you. She mikes yer slave awy ter pay the rent, an\u0027 all the money she earns she boozes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thet\u0027s true, she ain\u0027t been wot yer might call a good mother ter me--but some\u0027ow she\u0027s my mother, an\u0027 I don\u0027t like ter leave \u0027er on \u0027er own, now she\u0027s so old--an\u0027 she can\u0027t do much with the rheumatics. An\u0027 besides, Jim dear, it ain\u0027t only mother, but there\u0027s yer own kids, yer can\u0027t leave them.\u0027\\n\\n He thought for a while, and then said:\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re abaht right there, Liza; I dunno if I could get on without the kids. If I could only tike them an\u0027 you too, swop me bob, I should be \u0027appy.\u0027\\n\\n Liza smiled sadly.\\n\\n \u0027So yer see, Jim, we\u0027re in a bloomin\u0027 \u0027ole, an\u0027 there ain\u0027t no way aht of it thet I can see.\u0027\\n\\n He took her on his knees, and pressing her to him, kissed her very long and very lovingly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we must trust ter luck,\u0027 she said again, \u0027p\u0027raps somethin\u0027 \u0027ll \u0027appen soon, an\u0027 everythin\u0027 \u0027ll come right in the end--when we gets four balls of worsted for a penny.\u0027\\n\\n It was past twelve, and separating, they went by different ways along the dreary, wet, deserted roads till they came to Vere Street.\\n\\n The street seemed quite different to Liza from what it had been three months before. Tom, the humble adorer, had quite disappeared from her life. One day, three or four weeks after the August Bank Holiday, she saw him dawdling along the pavement, and it suddenly struck her that she had not seen him for a long time; but she had been so full of her happiness that she had been unable to think of anyone but Jim. She wondered at his absence, since before wherever she had been there was he certain to be also. She passed him, but to her astonishment he did not speak to her. She thought by some wonder he had not seen her, but she felt his gaze resting upon her. She turned back, and suddenly he dropped his eyes and looked down, walking on as if he had not seen her, but blushing furiously.\\n\\n \u0027Tom,\u0027 she said, \u0027why don\u0027t yer speak ter me.\u0027\\n\\n He started and blushed more than ever.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know yer was there,\u0027 he stuttered.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t tell me,\u0027 she said, \u0027wot\u0027s up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothin\u0027 as I knows of,\u0027 he answered uneasily.\\n\\n \u0027I ain\u0027t offended yer, \u0027ave I, Tom?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na, not as I knows of,\u0027 he replied, looking very unhappy.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t ever come my way now,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know as yer wanted ter see me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn! Yer knows I likes you as well as anybody.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yer likes so many people, Liza,\u0027 he said, flushing.\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027yer mean?\u0027 said Liza indignantly, but very red; she was afraid he knew now, and it was from him especially she would have been so glad to hide it.\\n\\n \u0027Nothin\u0027,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027One doesn\u0027t say things like thet without any meanin\u0027, unless one\u0027s a blimed fool.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right there, Liza,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I am a blimed fool.\u0027 He looked at her a little reproachfully, she thought, and then he said \u0027Good-bye,\u0027 and turned away.\\n\\n At first she was horrified that he should know of her love for Jim, but then she did not care. After all, it was nobody\u0027s business, and what did anything matter as long as she loved Jim and Jim loved her? Then she grew angry that Tom should suspect her; he could know nothing but that some of the men had seen her with Jim near Vauxhall, and it seemed mean that he should condemn her for that. Thenceforward, when she ran against Tom, she cut him; he never tried to speak to her, but as she passed him, pretending to look in front of her, she could see that he always blushed, and she fancied his eyes were very sorrowful. Then several weeks went by, and as she began to feel more and more lonely in the street she regretted the quarrel; she cried a little as she thought that she had lost his faithful gentle love and she would have much liked to be friends with him again. If he had only made some advance she would have welcomed him so cordially, but she was too proud to go to him herself and beg him to forgive her--and then how could he forgive her?\\n\\n She had lost Sally too, for on her marriage Harry had made her give up the factory; he was a young man with principles worthy of a Member of Parliament, and he had said:\\n\\n \u0027A woman\u0027s plice is \u0027er \u0027ome, an\u0027 if \u0027er old man can\u0027t afford ter keep \u0027er without \u0027er workin\u0027 in a factory--well, all I can say is thet \u0027e\u0027d better go an\u0027 git single.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quite right, too,\u0027 agreed his mother-in-law; \u0027an\u0027 wot\u0027s more, she\u0027ll \u0027ave a baby ter look after soon, an\u0027 thet\u0027ll tike \u0027er all \u0027er time, an\u0027 there\u0027s no one as knows thet better than me, for I\u0027ve \u0027ad twelve, ter sy nothin\u0027 of two stills an\u0027 one miss.\u0027\\n\\n Liza quite envied Sally her happiness, for the bride was brimming over with song and laughter; her happiness overwhelmed her.\\n\\n \u0027I am \u0027appy,\u0027 she said to Liza one day a few weeks after her marriage. \u0027You dunno wot a good sort \u0027Arry is. \u0027E\u0027s just a darlin\u0027, an\u0027 there\u0027s no mistikin\u0027 it. I don\u0027t care wot other people sy, but wot I says is, there\u0027s nothin\u0027 like marriage. Never a cross word passes his lips, an\u0027 mother \u0027as all \u0027er meals with us an\u0027 \u0027e says all the better. Well I\u0027m thet \u0027appy I simply dunno if I\u0027m standin\u0027 on my \u0027ead or on my \u0027eels.\u0027\\n\\n But alas! it did not last too long. Sally was not so full of joy when next Liza met her, and one day her eyes looked very much as if she had been crying.\\n\\n \u0027Wot\u0027s the matter?\u0027 asked Liza, looking at her. \u0027Wot \u0027ave yer been blubberin\u0027 abaht?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me?\u0027 said Sally, getting very red. \u0027Oh, I\u0027ve got a bit of a toothache, an\u0027--well, I\u0027m rather a fool like, an\u0027 it \u0027urt so much that I couldn\u0027t \u0027elp cryin\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n Liza was not satisfied, but could get nothing further out of her. Then one day it came out. It was a Saturday night, the time when women in Vere Street weep. Liza went up into Sally\u0027s room for a few minutes on her way to the Westminster Bridge Road, where she was to meet Jim. Harry had taken the top back room, and Liza, climbing up the second flight of stairs, called out as usual.\\n\\n \u0027Wot ho, Sally!\u0027\\n\\n The door remained shut, although Liza could see that there was a light in the room; but on getting to the door she stood still, for she heard the sound of sobbing. She listened for a minute and then knocked: there was a little flurry inside, and someone called out:\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Oo\u0027s there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only me,\u0027 said Liza, opening the door. As she did so she saw Sally rapidly wipe her eyes and put her handkerchief away. Her mother was sitting by her side, evidently comforting her.\\n\\n \u0027Wot\u0027s up, Sal?\u0027 asked Liza.\\n\\n \u0027Nothin\u0027,\u0027 answered Sally, with a brave little gasp to stop the crying, turning her face downwards so that Liza should not see the tears in her eyes; but they were too strong for her, and, quickly taking out her handkerchief, she hid her face in it and began to sob broken-heartedly. Liza looked at the mother in interrogation.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s thet man again!\u0027 said the lady, snorting and tossing her head.\\n\\n \u0027Not \u0027Arry?\u0027 asked Liza, in surprise.\\n\\n \u0027Not \u0027Arry--\u0027oo is it if it ain\u0027t \u0027Arry? The villin!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wot\u0027s \u0027e been doin\u0027, then?\u0027 asked Liza again.\\n\\n \u0027Beatin\u0027 \u0027er, that\u0027s wot \u0027e\u0027s been doin\u0027! Oh, the villin, \u0027e oughter be ashimed of \u0027isself \u0027e ought!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know \u0027e was like that!\u0027 said Liza.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t yer? I thought the \u0027ole street knew it by now,\u0027 said Mrs. Cooper indignantly. \u0027Oh, \u0027e\u0027s a wrong \u0027un, \u0027e is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t \u0027is fault,\u0027 put in Sally, amidst her sobs; \u0027it\u0027s only because \u0027e\u0027s \u0027ad a little drop too much. \u0027E\u0027s arright when \u0027e\u0027s sober.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A little drop too much! I should just think \u0027e\u0027d \u0027ad, the beast! I\u0027d give it \u0027im if I was a man. They\u0027re all like thet--\u0027usbinds is all alike; they\u0027re arright when they\u0027re sober--sometimes--but when they\u0027ve got the liquor in \u0027em, they\u0027re beasts, an\u0027 no mistike. I \u0027ad a \u0027usbind myself for five-an\u0027-twenty years, an\u0027 I know \u0027em.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, mother,\u0027 sobbed Sally, \u0027it was all my fault. I should \u0027ave come \u0027ome earlier.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na, it wasn\u0027t your fault at all. Just you look \u0027ere, Liza: this is wot \u0027e done an\u0027 call \u0027isself a man. Just because Sally\u0027d gone aht to \u0027ave a chat with Mrs. McLeod in the next \u0027ouse, when she come in \u0027e start bangin\u0027 \u0027er abaht. An\u0027 me, too, wot d\u0027yer think of that!\u0027 Mrs. Cooper was quite purple with indignation.\\n\\n \u0027Yus,\u0027 she went on, \u0027thet\u0027s a man for yer. Of course, I wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 ter stand there an\u0027 see my daughter bein\u0027 knocked abaht; it wasn\u0027t likely--was it? An\u0027 \u0027e rounds on me, an\u0027 \u0027e \u0027its me with \u0027is fist. Look \u0027ere.\u0027 She pulled up her sleeves and showed two red and brawny arms. \u0027\u0027E\u0027s bruised my arms; I thought \u0027e\u0027d broken it at fust. If I \u0027adn\u0027t put my arm up, \u0027e\u0027d \u0027ave got me on the \u0027ead, an\u0027 \u0027e might \u0027ave killed me. An\u0027 I says to \u0027im, \"If you touch me again, I\u0027ll go ter the police-station, thet I will!\" Well, that frightened \u0027im a bit, an\u0027 then didn\u0027t I let \u0027im \u0027ave it! \"You call yerself a man,\" says I, \"an\u0027 you ain\u0027t fit ter clean the drains aht.\" You should \u0027ave \u0027eard the language \u0027e used. \"You dirty old woman,\" says \u0027e, \"you go away; you\u0027re always interferin\u0027 with me.\" Well, I don\u0027t like ter repeat wot \u0027e said, and thet\u0027s the truth. An\u0027 I says ter \u0027im, \"I wish yer\u0027d never married my daughter, an\u0027 if I\u0027d known you was like this I\u0027d \u0027ave died sooner than let yer.\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I didn\u0027t know \u0027e was like thet!\u0027 said Liza.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027E was arright at fust,\u0027 said Sally.\\n\\n \u0027Yus, they\u0027re always arright at fust! But ter think it should \u0027ave come to this now, when they ain\u0027t been married three months, an\u0027 the first child not born yet! I think it\u0027s disgraceful.\u0027\\n\\n Liza stayed a little while longer, helping to comfort Sally, who kept pathetically taking to herself all the blame of the dispute; and then, bidding her good night and better luck, she slid off to meet Jim.\\n\\n When she reached the appointed spot he was not to be found. She waited for some time, and at last saw him come out of the neighbouring pub.\\n\\n \u0027Good night, Jim,\u0027 she said as she came up to him.\\n\\n \u0027So you\u0027ve turned up, \u0027ave yer?\u0027 he answered roughly, turning round.\\n\\n \u0027Wot\u0027s the matter, Jim?\u0027 she asked in a frightened way, for he had never spoken to her in that manner.\\n\\n \u0027Nice thing ter keep me witin\u0027 all night for yer to come aht.\u0027\\n\\n She saw that he had been drinking, and answered humbly.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m very sorry, Jim, but I went in to Sally, an\u0027 \u0027er bloke \u0027ad been knockin\u0027 \u0027er abaht, an\u0027 so I sat with \u0027er a bit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Knockin\u0027 \u0027er abaht, \u0027ad \u0027e? and serve \u0027er damn well right too; an\u0027 there\u0027s many more as could do with a good \u0027idin\u0027!\u0027\\n\\n Liza did not answer. He looked at her, and then suddenly said:\\n\\n \u0027Come in an\u0027 \u0027ave a drink.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na, I\u0027m not thirsty; I don\u0027t want a drink,\u0027 she answered.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said angrily.\\n\\n \u0027Na, Jim, you\u0027ve had quite enough already.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Oo are you talkin\u0027 ter?\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t come if yer don\u0027t want ter; I\u0027ll go an\u0027 \u0027ave one by myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na, Jim, don\u0027t.\u0027 She caught hold of his arm.\\n\\n \u0027Yus, I shall,\u0027 he said, going towards the pub, while she held him back. \u0027Let me go, can\u0027t yer! Let me go!\u0027 He roughly pulled his arm away from her. As she tried to catch hold of it again, he pushed her back, and in the little scuffle caught her a blow over the face.\\n\\n \u0027Oh!\u0027 she cried, \u0027you did \u0027urt!\u0027\\n\\n He was sobered at once.\\n\\n \u0027Liza,\u0027 he said. \u0027I ain\u0027t \u0027urt yer?\u0027 She didn\u0027t answer, and he took her in his arms. \u0027Liza, I ain\u0027t \u0027urt you, \u0027ave I? Say I ain\u0027t \u0027urt yer. I\u0027m so sorry, I beg your pardon, Liza.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arright, old chap,\u0027 she said, smiling charmingly on him. \u0027It wasn\u0027t the blow that \u0027urt me much; it was the wy you was talkin\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean it, Liza.\u0027 He was so contrite, he could not humble himself enough. \u0027I \u0027ad another bloomin\u0027 row with the missus ter-night, an\u0027 then when I didn\u0027t find you \u0027ere, an\u0027 I kept witin\u0027 an\u0027 witin\u0027--well, I fair downright lost my \u0027air. An\u0027 I \u0027ad two or three pints of four \u0027alf, an\u0027--well, I dunno--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Never mind, old cock. I can stand more than thet as long as yer loves me.\u0027\\n\\n He kissed her and they were quite friends again. But the little quarrel had another effect which was worse for Liza. When she woke up next morning she noticed a slight soreness over the ridge of bone under the left eye, and on looking in the glass saw that it was black and blue and green. She bathed it, but it remained, and seemed to get more marked. She was terrified lest people should see it, and kept indoors all day; but next morning it was blacker than ever. She went to the factory with her hat over her eyes and her head bent down; she escaped observation, but on the way home she was not so lucky. The sharp eyes of some girls noticed it first.\\n\\n \u0027Wot\u0027s the matter with yer eye?\u0027 asked one of them.\\n\\n \u0027Me?\u0027 answered Liza, putting her hand up as if in ignorance. \u0027Nothin\u0027 thet I knows of.\u0027\\n\\n Two or three young men were standing by, and hearing the girl, looked up.\\n\\n \u0027Why, yer\u0027ve got a black eye, Liza!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me? I ain\u0027t got no black eye!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus you \u0027ave; \u0027ow d\u0027yer get it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Liza. \u0027I didn\u0027t know I \u0027ad one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn! tell us another!\u0027 was the answer. \u0027One doesn\u0027t git a black eye without knowin\u0027 \u0027ow they got it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I did fall against the chest of drawers yesterday; I suppose I must \u0027ave got it then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes, we believe thet, don\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know \u0027e was so \u0027andy with \u0027is dukes, did you, Ted?\u0027 asked one man of another.\\n\\n Liza felt herself grow red to the tips of her toes.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027Never you mind; nobody you know.\u0027\\n\\n At that moment Jim\u0027s wife passed and looked at her with a scowl. Liza wished herself a hundred miles away, and blushed more violently than ever.\\n\\n \u0027Wot are yer blushin\u0027 abaht?\u0027 ingenuously asked one of the girls.\\n\\n And they all looked from her to Mrs. Blakeston and back again. Someone said: \u0027\u0027Ow abaht our Sunday boots on now?\u0027 And a titter went through them. Liza\u0027s nerve deserted her; she could think of nothing to say, and a sob burst from her. To hide the tears which were coming from her eyes she turned away and walked homewards. Immediately a great shout of laughter broke from the group, and she heard them positively screaming till she got into her own house.\\n\\n 十一月。风和日丽的季节过去了，随之而去的是吉姆和丽莎的爱情的欢乐。\\n\\n 他们夜里来到亚尔培堤，只觉得阴沉寒冷；有时薄雾笼罩着河岸，使一盏盏灯光朦朦胧胧地化成一个个大光圈；又时常下着小雨，阴冷入骨。路上偶有行人，撑着伞，眼睛直盯着前方，匆匆在阴湿和寒冷中走过；时而一辆出租马车很快地经过，两边泥浆飞溅。\\n\\n 那些凳子都空着没人坐，除了或许有个把无家可归、又没钱找个地方投宿的可怜人，蜷缩在角落里，头钻在胸窝里，死人般地沉睡着。\\n\\n 湿的泥浆把丽莎的裙子粘住在她腿上，潮气从腿上渐渐侵袭到全身，终于使她噤战不止，为了得到一点暖气，紧紧贴着吉姆。\\n\\n 有时候他们跑进滑铁卢注或查林广场车站的三等车候车室，坐在那里。但那儿不象夏夜的公园和河堤。那儿暖和，可是热使他们潮湿的农服蒸发出难闻的味儿，煤气灯耀眼睛，而且他们讨厌那穿流不息地出出进进的人，一开门就是一阵冷风．他们讨厌车站管理员和脚夫们叫喊“开车了”的喧嚷和机车刺耳的气笛声，讨厌那一片忙乱、嘈杂和烦嚣。\\n\\n 到十一点钟光景，来往火车少了，他们可以安静一点，可是他们心情不宁，感到烦闷、忧伤、痛苦。\\n\\n 有一天晚上，他们坐在滑铁卢车站的候车室里。外面是大雾——十一月份的黄色的浓雾弥漫着整个候车室，直往肺里钻，它叫人嘴里苦涩，眼睛刺痛。此刻是十一点半左右，车站上异常地清静：几个乘客穿着大衣、围着围巾，踱来踱去，在等待末班火车，一两个脚夫站在那里打呵欠。\\n\\n 丽莎和吉姆在那儿闷坐了一个钟头，彼此没说过一句话；两个人都抑郁不欢，好似头脑里压着沉重的铅块。\\n\\n 丽莎身子向前倾着，臂肘撑在膝盖上，双手捧着脸。\\n\\n “我能堂堂正正地做人该多好，”她终于说，眼睛也不抬一抬。\\n\\n “是啊，你为什么不跟我在一起？那样你不就好了吗？”他回答。\\n\\n “不．那不行，我不能那样做。”\\n\\n 他几次三番要求她干脆跟他住一起去，然而她始终不答应。\\n\\n “你可以跟我一起住，我到霍洛韦注去租间屋子，我们在那里一起住，就象结了婚的一样。”\\n\\n “你的工作怎么办？”\\n\\n “我能这里找到工作，也能在那边找到工作。我对现在的情况实在受不了啦。”\\n\\n “我也是，可我不能把我妈丢下。”\\n\\n “她可以一起去嘛。”\\n\\n “我没有结婚．不能叫她去。我不愿意让她知道——知道我走错了路。”\\n\\n “我跟你结婚。天啊，我是日思夜想正要跟你结婚呀。”\\n\\n “你不能；你已经结婚了。”\\n\\n “那没有关系！要是我每个月工钱里拿出一点给我老婆，她会签字立凭据，放弃她对我的一切要求的，那样我们就好结婚了。有个和我在一起干活的人就是那样做的，什么都解决。”\\n\\n 丽莎摇摇头。\\n\\n “不，我现在不能这样做；这要犯重婚罪，警察把你抓去，你要吃官司，服一年苦役。”\\n\\n “但是，天晓得，丽莎，我没法一直这样下去。你知道我那老婆——该死的，她毫无疑问知道你和我搅在一起，她都在我面前说穿了。”\\n\\n “她不会说穿吧？”\\n\\n “嗯，她并不明说，可她发脾气，不睬我，而当我说了什么的时候，她就跟我吵，什么都挖空心思地骂得出来。我要狠狠揍她一顿，可我又不大想动手！她把一个家闹得变成了我的地狱．我实在忍受不下去啊！”\\n\\n “你只好忍耐I你没有办法。”\\n\\n “有办法，我有办法，那就是你跟我走。我看你根本不喜欢我，否则你准跟我走了。”\\n\\n 她转身向他，双臂抱着他的脖子。\\n\\n “你知道我喜欢你的，我亲爱的．”她说。“你是我天下最喜欢的人，但是我不能丢下我妈走掉呀。\"\\n\\n “我真不懂为什么；她从没有好好待过你。她要你做死做活给她付房租，而她挣的钱全部喝酒喝掉。”\\n\\n “的确，她对我从来不是个你说的好妈妈——可是她总是我的妈妈，我不愿把她一个人丢下不管，而且她年纪这么大，患着风湿又不能多做什么事。再说，亲爱的吉姆，不光是我妈，还有你自己的孩子们，你不能丢了他们。”\\n\\n 他想了想，然后说——\\n\\n “你这话也对，丽莎；我恐怕是丢不下他们。要是我能带着他们，也带着你，一起走，老天爷，我才开心哪。”\\n\\n 丽莎苦笑了一下。\\n\\n “所以你瞧，吉姆，我们的处境真糟透，我竟毫无办法。”\\n\\n 他把她抱在膝盖上，紧紧搂住她，长长地热情地吻着她。\\n\\n “唉，我们只得听天由命，”她又说，“或许就会有什么转机，最后一切都好——到时候一个铜币买四团绒线。”\\n\\n 时间已过十二点，他们分手了，各自沿着阴暗、潮湿、阒无人影的道路，分头回到维尔街去。\\n\\n 丽莎觉得这条小街似乎跟三个月前完全两样了，谦卑地爱慕她的汤姆已经在她生命中消失了。\\n\\n 还是在八月公假日过后三、四个星期的某一天，她曾经看见汤姆徘徊在人行道上，她顿觉好久没有见他了。只是当时她满怀欢乐，除了吉姆之外，谁都不在心上。她不知汤姆到哪儿去了，因为在过去，无论她到哪里，汤姆总也在那里。\\n\\n 她经过他身边，可是他并不理她，这使她大为惊异。\\n\\n 她想会不会碰巧他没有看见她，不过她明明觉得他的目光注视着她。\\n\\n 她回过头来，他突然低头往下看，仿佛没看见她似地向前走去，可是面孔涨得通红。\\n\\n “汤姆，”她招呼他，“你怎么不理我？’’\\n\\n 他愣了一下，面孔涨得更红了。\\n\\n “我没看到你，”他回答。\\n\\n “别对我装蒜，”她说；“到底怎么回事？’’\\n\\n “我也不知道，”他勉强地说。\\n\\n “我没有得罪你吧，汤姆？”\\n\\n “不，我没有觉得，”他回答，很沮丧的样子。\\n\\n “你这一阵子一直不来接近我，”她说。\\n\\n “我不知道你要和我见面。”\\n\\n “去！你知道我同喜欢别人一样喜欢你。”\\n\\n “你喜欢的人太多了，丽莎，”他涨红着脸说。\\n\\n “你这是什么意思？”丽莎气愤地说，但是脸也涨得很红；她怕他这会儿都知道了，她是特别不愿意让他知道的。\\n\\n “没有什么，”他答道。\\n\\n “一个人说这话不会没有意思，除非他是该死的傻子。”\\n\\n “你说对了，丽莎，”他回答，“我是个该死的傻子。”\\n\\n 他对她瞥了一眼，她觉得他目光里带有责骂的意思。他接着说了声“再见’’，转身就走了。\\n\\n 开始她很怕他知道了她对吉姆的爱情；后来她觉得也无所谓。毕竟，这不关别人的事，只要她爱吉姆、吉姆爱她，有什么关系？\\n\\n 然后她又恼恨汤姆怀疑她；他除了有几个人曾经在沃克斯霍尔附近看见她和吉姆在一起之外，别的什么也不会知道。她以为他凭这一点对她大惊小怪，十分可恶。\\n\\n 从那一回之后，她遇上汤姆就回避他。他从不想对她说话，但是她经过他身边的时候，尽管他装着看在她前面的样子，她看得出他每次都脸红，同时总觉得他眼睛里流露着非常悲伤的神色。\\n\\n 过了几个星期，她越来越感觉到在小街上怪孤寂的。她懊悔那回跟汤姆吵嘴。她想到失去了他的忠实而温柔的爱情，哭泣起来，她真想跟他重归于好。\\n\\n 当时只要他主动有些表示，她马上就热情欢迎他了，而她又是那么高傲，不肯自己去要求他原谅她——不过，他怎么能原谅她呢？\\n\\n 她也失去了萨莉，因为她一结婚，哈利就叫她放弃了厂里的工作。他是个足以当国会议员讲一篇大道理的人，他说一\\n\\n “女人的位置是在家庭里。．如果一个男人不能养活老婆，非要她到厂里去做工——那末，我只能认为他还是做光棍的好。”\\n\\n “这也对，”他的丈母娘同意；“而且她很快就有孩子要照顾，这我是比什么人都体会，我生过十二个孩子，还不算两个死胎和一次流产。”\\n\\n 丽莎很羡慕萨莉的幸福，因为新娘快活得又是唱歌，又是欢笑，简直乐不可支。\\n\\n “我很幸福．”她在结婚的几个星期后有一天对丽莎说。“你不知道哈利多好。他真是个宝贝，没错的。我不管人家怎么说，我说没有比结婚更幸福的。他嘴里从没有一句恼火的话。我妈三顿都在我们这儿吃，他说这再好也没有。嗳，我真是快活得东南西北也分不清了。”\\n\\n 奈何好景不常！\\n\\n 后来丽莎碰到她，萨莉可就不是那么喜满胸怀了。有一天她眼睛很象是哭过的样子。\\n\\n “怎么啦？”丽莎瞧着她。“怎么你眼睛都哭肿了？”\\n\\n “我？”萨莉说，一阵脸红。“噢，我有点牙痛——我真有点傻，牙痛得厉害，我不禁哭了。”\\n\\n 丽莎对这回答不满意，可也没法再问出什么来。\\n\\n 后来另有一天，这才真相大白。\\n\\n 那是个星期六的夜晚，是维尔街上女人哭泣的时候。\\n\\n 丽莎在到威斯敏斯特桥大道去碰头吉姆的路上，顺便到萨莉屋里去看看她。哈利租的是间顶层的后房，丽莎爬到第二座楼梯时，照例叫道——\\n\\n “喂，嗬，萨莉！”\\n\\n 房门不开，虽然丽莎看得出房间里面灯亮着。她听见呜咽的声音，所以她到房门口，站停了脚。她听了一会，然后敲敲房门，里面一阵慌张，接着有人叫着答应——\\n\\n “谁啊？”\\n\\n “就是我，”丽莎说，推门进去。她踏进房门，只见萨莉急忙揩揩眼睛，把手帕塞开。她母亲坐在她旁边，显然在安慰她。\\n\\n “发生什么事啦？”丽莎问。\\n\\n “没事，”萨莉回答，拚命屏住了哭泣，低下了头，不让丽莎看见她眼眶里的泪水。但是泪水还是直涌而出，她迅速拿出手帕，掩着面孔，伤心地抽噎起来。丽莎向她母亲疑问地望望。\\n\\n “啊，又是那个家伙！”老太太说着，仰天长叹。\\n\\n “不是哈利吧！”丽莎惊异地说。\\n\\n “不是哈利？一一不是哈利又是准！那个流氓!”\\n\\n “他干出了什么来啦？”丽莎又问。\\n\\n “打她，这就是他干出来的！啊，这个流氓，他改为自己害臊——应该害臊！”\\n\\n “我原先不知道他是那样的人！”丽莎说。\\n\\n “你不知道？我想现在整条街上都知道了，”库柏老太太愤恨地说。“唉，他真不是个东西！”\\n\\n “这不是他的错，”萨莉抽抽搭搭地哭着插嘴说，“他只是因为多喝了一口。他不喝醉的时候是好好的。”\\n\\n “多喝了一口！我看他也确实是多喝了一口，这畜生！我要是个男的，我要好好教训他一顿。他们都是那个样子——做丈夫的都是一样；有时候他们不喝醉，确是好好的；可一喝醉就是畜生，没错的。过去我也有丈夫，一起生活了二十五年，所以我懂得他们。”\\n\\n “不过，妈，”萨莉抽噎着说，“这回全是我不好。我该早些回家的。”\\n\\n “不，这根本不是你的过错。你瞧瞧这里，丽莎：这是他干的，还自己算是个男子汉。就只因为萨莉出去和隔壁麦克劳德太太聊了会天，回到屋里，他就把她乱打。还打我，你倒想想看！”库柏太太气愤得脸都发了紫。\\n\\n “是的，”她继续说，“这叫是男子汉。当然我总不见得站在那里，眼看我女儿被乱踢乱打吧？他又骂我，用拳头打我。瞧这里。”\\n\\n 她撩起袖子，露出两条又红又强壮的．臂膊。\\n\\n “他打伤了我的手臂；我起初还当打断了呢。要不是我举起臂膀来，他会打我头上，甚至把我打死了的。\\n\\n “我对他说，‘你敢再碰碰我，我报警察局去，我报局去！’\\n\\n “嗨，这一下他可有点害怕了，我就这样放过他吗！\\n\\n “‘你还自己算是个男子汉，’我说，‘你还不配去通阴沟呢。’\\n\\n “你没听到他说的下流话。‘你这肮脏的老太婆，’他说，‘你滚开；你老是跟我缠不清。’我实在不高兴重复他说的话。\\n\\n “我对他说，‘我女儿不做你老婆多好，我早知道你是这个样子，我死也不会让她嫁给你。”’\\n\\n “唉，我也想不到他是这样的！”丽莎说。\\n\\n “开始的时候，他很好的，”萨莉说。\\n\\n “是啊，他们开始的时候总是很好的！可是你想想看，现在他们结婚还不到三个月，第一个孩子还没生下，已经闹到这个地步！真丢人哪！”\\n\\n 丽莎继续待了一会，帮着安慰安慰萨莉，可怜她始终把这回吵架的过错拉在自己身上。\\n\\n 最后她向萨莉道了晚安，祝她今后幸福，自己赶去会见吉姆了。\\n\\n 她到了约好的地点，不看见他。她等了好一会，才看见他从附近一家小酒店里出来。\\n\\n “晚上好，吉姆，”她跑到他面前招呼他。\\n\\n “你到底来了，是不是？”他回过头来，粗暴地说。\\n\\n “怎么了，吉姆？”她怯声怯气地问，因为他以前从来没有这样对她说话过。\\n\\n “你好哇，叫我整夜地等着你出来！”\\n\\n 她知道他喝了酒，她用歉疚的口气回答说——\\n\\n “对不起，吉姆，我到萨莉那里去弯了弯。她男人打了她一顿，所以我陪她坐了一会。”\\n\\n “打了一顿吗？也是活该；该好好打的女人多着呢！”\\n\\n 丽莎不响。他朝她看看，然后忽然说——\\n\\n “一起去喝一杯。”\\n\\n “不，我不渴，我不想喝，”她回答。\\n\\n “一起去”，他凶狠狠地说。\\n\\n “不要去了，吉姆，你已经喝得够多了。\"\\n\\n “你在对谁说话？”他说。“你不去就不去，我一个人去喝一杯。”\\n\\n “不，吉姆，不要去。’’她拖着他的手臂。\\n\\n “我要去，”他说着，往小酒店走去，丽莎拖住他。\\n\\n “让我去，你让我！让我去！”他猛力把丽莎甩开。她还想去拖住他，他推开她，在你拉我扯的当儿，他给她j：卜面一拳。\\n\\n “噢！”她说，“你打得我好痛！”\\n\\n 他顿时清醒了过来。\\n\\n “丽莎．”他说。“我没有打痛你吧？”\\n\\n 她不作声，他把她抱在怀里。\\n\\n “丽莎，我没有打痛你吧，没有吧？说我没有打痛你。我很遗憾，我求你原谅我，丽莎。”\\n\\n “好，亲爱的，”她说，对他温柔地微笑着。“这一拳倒没什么，你说话的口气和态度叫我心痛。”\\n\\n “我是无心的，丽莎，’’他很后悔，尽量低声下气地说。“今夜我跟老太婆又大吵了一场，跑到这里又不看见你，尽等着等着——唉，我实在恼火了。因此我去喝了两、三品脱四便士半的啤酒——我自己也不知道——”\\n\\n “不要紧，亲爱的，只要你爱我，更厉害的我也受得了。”\\n\\n 他吻她，他们又完全和好了。\\n\\n 不过，这一场小吵架对丽莎有更坏的影响。\\n\\n 当她第二天醒来的时候，她觉得左眼底下的面颊骨上有点痛．朝镜子里一看，原来是又黑、又青、又绿的一块。她把它洗刷也洗刷不掉，而且似乎反而更加显著。她深怕人家看到，所以在家里躲了一整天，可是第二天这一块更黑得厉害。\\n\\n 她到厂里去的时候，把帽子盖着眼睛，把头沉得低低的，总算没被人发觉。但是她在回家的路上，没有这样运气。有几个姑娘目光锐利，首先发现。\\n\\n “你的眼睛怎么了？”一个姑娘问。\\n\\n “我？’’丽莎应道，假装糊涂，伸手摸摸。“我不知道嘛。”\\n\\n 有两三个年轻小伙子站在旁边，听到了那姑娘说的话，也注意到了。\\n\\n “呀，你眼睛青肿了，丽莎！”\\n\\n “我？我眼睛没有青肿！”\\n\\n “青肿了；怎么会青肿了的？”\\n\\n “我不知道，”丽莎说。“我不知道我眼睛青肿。”\\n\\n “得了！你再说谎吧！”这是她得到的回答。“没有人会眼睛青肿了而不知怎么青肿的。”\\n\\n “哦，我昨天确实在五斗橱上撞过一下，准是那一撞撞出来的。”\\n\\n “原来如此，我们才相信哪，相信吗？”\\n\\n “我倒不知道他的拳头有这么厉害，你本来知道吗，特德？”一个男的问另一个男的。\\n\\n 丽莎觉得从脸上一直红到了脚趾尖。\\n\\n “你们说谁？”她问。\\n\\n “你别管，你不认识的。”\\n\\n 这时候，吉姆的妻子走过，她对丽莎恶狠狠地看看。丽莎恨不得自己远在一百英里外，脸涨得更红了。\\n\\n “你为什么脸红了？”那些姑娘中的一个爽快地问。\\n\\n 他们的目光从丽莎身上移到布莱克斯顿太太身上，又重新移回来。\\n\\n 有一个人说，“这下我们该穿起节日的皮靴，庆祝我们胜利了吧？”大伙嗤嗤地窃笑。\\n\\n 丽莎的神经支持不住了；她一句对答的话也想不出来，突然哽咽起来。为了不让人看见她夺眶而出的眼泪，转身就朝家里走。\\n\\n 人群中立即爆发出一阵叫笑，直到她走进屋里，还清清楚楚听得见他们的尖叫。\\n\\n \\n\\n
