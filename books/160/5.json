{"id":4567,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"As soon as Liza had recovered herself she started examining the people on the brake; and first of all she took stock of the woman whom Jim Blakeston had with him.\\n\\n \u0027This is my missus!\u0027 said Jim, pointing to her with his thumb.\\n\\n \u0027You ain\u0027t been dahn in the street much, \u0027ave yer?\u0027 said Liza, by way of making the acquaintance.\\n\\n \u0027Na,\u0027 answered Mrs. Blakeston, \u0027my youngster\u0027s been dahn with the measles, an\u0027 I\u0027ve \u0027ad my work cut out lookin\u0027 after \u0027im.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, an\u0027 is \u0027e all right now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus, \u0027e\u0027s gettin\u0027 on fine, an\u0027 Jim wanted ter go ter Chingford ter-day, an\u0027 \u0027e says ter me, well, \u0027e says, \"You come along ter Chingford, too; it\u0027ll do you good.\" An\u0027 \u0027e says, \"You can leave Polly\"--she\u0027s my eldest, yer know--\"you can leave Polly,\" says \u0027e, \"ter look after the kids.\" So I says, \"Well, I don\u0027t mind if I do,\" says I.\u0027\\n\\n Meanwhile Liza was looking at her. First she noticed her dress: she wore a black cloak and a funny, old-fashioned black bonnet; then examining the woman herself, she saw a middle-sized, stout person anywhere between thirty and forty years old. She had a large, fat face with a big mouth, and her hair was curiously done, parted in the middle and plastered down on each side of the head in little plaits. One could see that she was a woman of great strength, notwithstanding evident traces of hard work and much child-bearing.\\n\\n Liza knew all the other passengers, and now that everyone was settled down and had got over the excitement of departure, they had time to greet one another. They were delighted to have Liza among them, for where she was there was no dullness. Her attention was first of all taken up by a young coster who had arrayed himself in the traditional costume--grey suit, tight trousers, and shiny buttons in profusion.\\n\\n \u0027Wot cheer, Bill!\u0027 she cried to him.\\n\\n \u0027Wot cheer, Liza!\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027You are got up dossy, you\u0027ll knock \u0027em.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na then, Liza Kemp,\u0027 said his companion, turning round with mock indignation, \u0027you let my Johnny alone. If you come gettin\u0027 round \u0027im I\u0027ll give you wot for.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arright, Clary Sharp, I don\u0027t want \u0027im,\u0027 answered Liza. \u0027I\u0027ve got one of my own, an\u0027 thet\u0027s a good \u0027andful--ain\u0027t it, Tom?\u0027\\n\\n Tom was delighted, and, unable to find a repartee, in his pleasure gave Liza a great nudge with his elbow.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Oo, I say,\u0027 said Liza, putting her hand to her side. \u0027Tike care of my ribs; you\u0027ll brike \u0027em.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Them\u0027s not yer ribs,\u0027 shouted a candid friend--\u0027them\u0027s yer whale-bones yer afraid of breakin\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Ave yer got whale-bones?\u0027 said Tom, with affected simplicity, putting his arm round her waist to feel.\\n\\n \u0027Na, then,\u0027 she said, \u0027keep off the grass!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I only wanted ter know if you\u0027d got any.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn; yer don\u0027t git round me like thet.\u0027\\n\\n He still kept as he was.\\n\\n \u0027Na then,\u0027 she repeated, \u0027tike yer \u0027and away. If yer touch me there you\u0027ll \u0027ave ter marry me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thet\u0027s just wot I wants ter do, Liza!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut it!\u0027 she answered cruelly, and drew his arm away from her waist.\\n\\n The horses scampered on, and the man behind blew his horn with vigour.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t bust yerself, guv\u0027nor!\u0027 said one of the passengers to him when he made a particularly discordant sound. They drove along eastwards, and as the hour grew later the streets became more filled and the traffic greater. At last they got on the road to Chingford, and caught up numbers of other vehicles going in the same direction--donkey-shays, pony-carts, tradesmen\u0027s carts, dog-carts, drags, brakes, every conceivable kind of wheel thing, all filled with people, the wretched donkey dragging along four solid rate-payers to the pair of stout horses easily managing a couple of score. They exchanged cheers and greetings as they passed, the \u0027Red Lion\u0027 brake being noticeable above all for its uproariousness. As the day wore on the sun became hotter, and the road seemed more dusty and threw up a greater heat.\\n\\n \u0027I am getting \u0027ot!\u0027 was the common cry, and everyone began to puff and sweat.\\n\\n The ladies removed their cloaks and capes, and the men, following their example, took off their coats and sat in their shirt-sleeves. Whereupon ensued much banter of a not particularly edifying kind respecting the garments which each person would like to remove--which showed that the innuendo of French farce is not so unknown to the upright, honest Englishman as might be supposed.\\n\\n At last came in sight the half-way house, where the horses were to have a rest and a sponge down. They had been talking of it for the last quarter of a mile, and when at length it was observed on the top of a hill a cheer broke out, and some thirsty wag began to sing \u0027Rule Britannia\u0027, whilst others burst forth with a different national ditty, \u0027Beer, Glorious Beer!\u0027 They drew up before the pub entrance, and all climbed down as quickly as they could. The bar was besieged, and potmen and barmaids were quickly busy drawing beer and handing it over to the eager folk outside.\\n\\n THE IDYLL OF CORYDON AND PHYLLIS.\\n\\n Gallantry ordered that the faithful swain and the amorous shepherdess should drink out of one and the same pot.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Urry up an\u0027 \u0027ave your whack,\u0027 said Corydon, politely handing the foaming bowl for his fair one to drink from.\\n\\n Phyllis, without replying, raised it to her lips and drank deep. The swain watched anxiously.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Ere, give us a chanst!\u0027 he said, as the pot was raised higher and higher and its contents appeared to be getting less and less.\\n\\n At this the amorous shepherdess stopped and handed the pot to her lover.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m dashed!\u0027 said Corydon, looking into it; and added: \u0027I guess you know a thing or two.\u0027 Then with courtly grace putting his own lips to the place where had been those of his beloved, finished the pint.\\n\\n \u0027Go\u0027 lumme!\u0027 remarked the shepherdess, smacking her lips, \u0027that was somethin\u0027 like!\u0027 And she put out her tongue and licked her lips, and then breathed deeply.\\n\\n The faithful swain having finished, gave a long sigh, and said:\\n\\n \u0027Well, I could do with some more!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For the matter of thet, I could do with a gargle!\u0027\\n\\n Thus encouraged, the gallant returned to the bar, and soon brought out a second pint.\\n\\n \u0027You \u0027ave fust pop,\u0027 amorously remarked Phyllis, and he took a long drink and handed the pot to her.\\n\\n She, with maiden modesty, turned it so as to have a different part to drink from; but he remarked as he saw her:\\n\\n \u0027You are bloomin\u0027 particular.\u0027\\n\\n Then, unwilling to grieve him, she turned it back again and applied her ruby lips to the place where his had been.\\n\\n \u0027Now we shan\u0027t be long!\u0027 she remarked, as she handed him back the pot.\\n\\n The faithful swain took out of his pocket a short clay pipe, blew through it, filled it, and began to smoke, while Phyllis sighed at the thought of the cool liquid gliding down her throat, and with the pleasing recollection gently stroked her stomach. Then Corydon spat, and immediately his love said:\\n\\n \u0027I can spit farther than thet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I bet yer yer can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n She tried, and did. He collected himself and spat again, further than before, she followed him, and in this idyllic contest they remained till the tootling horn warned them to take their places.\\n\\n * * * * *\\n\\n At last they reached Chingford, and here the horses were taken out and the drag, on which they were to lunch, drawn up in a sheltered spot. They were all rather hungry, but as it was not yet feeding-time, they scattered to have drinks meanwhile. Liza and Tom, with Sally and her young man, went off together to the nearest public-house, and as they drank beer, Harry, who was a great sportsman, gave them a graphic account of a prize-fight he had seen on the previous Saturday evening, which had been rendered specially memorable by one man being so hurt that he had died from the effects. It had evidently been a very fine affair, and Harry said that several swells from the West End had been present, and he related their ludicrous efforts to get in without being seen by anyone, and their terror when someone to frighten them called out \u0027Copper!\u0027 Then Tom and he entered into a discussion on the subject of boxing, in which Tom, being a shy and undogmatic sort of person, was entirely worsted. After this they strolled back to the brake, and found things being prepared for luncheon; the hampers were brought out and emptied, and the bottles of beer in great profusion made many a thirsty mouth thirstier.\\n\\n \u0027Come along, lidies an\u0027 gentlemen--if you are gentlemen,\u0027 shouted the coachman; \u0027the animals is now goin\u0027 ter be fed!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn awy,\u0027 answered somebody, \u0027we\u0027re not hanimals; we don\u0027t drink water.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re too clever,\u0027 remarked the coachman; \u0027I can see you\u0027ve just come from the board school.\u0027\\n\\n As the former speaker was a lady of quite mature appearance, the remark was not without its little irony. The other man blew his horn by way of grace, at which Liza called out to him:\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t do thet, you\u0027ll bust, I know you will, an\u0027 if you bust you\u0027ll quite spoil my dinner!\u0027\\n\\n Then they all set to. Pork-pies, saveloys, sausages, cold potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, cold bacon, veal, ham, crabs and shrimps, cheese, butter, cold suet-puddings and treacle, gooseberry-tarts, cherry-tarts, butter, bread, more sausages, and yet again pork-pies! They devoured the provisions like ravening beasts, stolidly, silently, earnestly, in large mouthfuls which they shoved down their throats unmasticated. The intelligent foreigner seeing them thus dispose of their food would have understood why England is a great nation. He would have understood why Britons never, never will be slaves. They never stopped except to drink, and then at each gulp they emptied their glass; no heel-taps! And still they ate, and still they drank--but as all things must cease, they stopped at last, and a long sigh of content broke from their two-and-thirty throats.\\n\\n Then the gathering broke up, and the good folk paired themselves and separated. Harry and his lady strolled off to secluded byways in the forest, so that they might discourse of their loves and digest their dinner. Tom had all the morning been waiting for this happy moment; he had counted on the expansive effect of a full stomach to thaw his Liza\u0027s coldness, and he had pictured himself sitting on the grass with his back against the trunk of a spreading chestnut-tree, with his arm round his Liza\u0027s waist, and her head resting affectionately on his manly bosom. Liza, too, had foreseen the separation into couples after dinner, and had been racking her brains to find a means of getting out of it.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want \u0027im slobberin\u0027 abaht me,\u0027 she said; \u0027it gives me the sick, all this kissin\u0027 an\u0027 cuddlin\u0027!\u0027\\n\\n She scarcely knew why she objected to his caresses; but they bored her and made her cross. But luckily the blessed institution of marriage came to her rescue, for Jim and his wife naturally had no particular desire to spend the afternoon together, and Liza, seeing a little embarrassment on their part, proposed that they should go for a walk together in the forest.\\n\\n Jim agreed at once, and with pleasure, but Tom was dreadfully disappointed. He hadn\u0027t the courage to say anything, but he glared at Blakeston. Jim smiled benignly at him, and Tom began to sulk. Then they began a funny walk through the woods. Jim tried to go on with Liza, and Liza was not at all disinclined to this, for she had come to the conclusion that Jim, notwithstanding his \u0027cheek\u0027, was not \u0027\u0027alf a bad sort\u0027. But Tom kept walking alongside of them, and as Jim slightly quickened his pace so as to get Liza on in front, Tom quickened his, and Mrs. Blakeston, who didn\u0027t want to be left behind, had to break into a little trot to keep up with them. Jim tried also to get Liza all to himself in the conversation, and let Tom see that he was out in the cold, but Tom would break in with cross, sulky remarks, just to make the others uncomfortable. Liza at last got rather vexed with him.\\n\\n \u0027Strikes me you got aht of bed the wrong way this mornin\u0027,\u0027 she said to him.\\n\\n \u0027Yer didn\u0027t think thet when yer said you\u0027d come aht with me.\u0027 He emphasized the \u0027me\u0027.\\n\\n Liza shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027You give me the \u0027ump,\u0027 she said. \u0027If yer wants ter mike a fool of yerself, you can go elsewhere an\u0027 do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose yer want me ter go awy now,\u0027 he said angrily.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t say I did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arright, Liza, I won\u0027t stay where I\u0027m not wanted.\u0027 And turning on his heel he marched off, striking through the underwood into the midst of the forest.\\n\\n He felt extremely unhappy as he wandered on, and there was a choky feeling in his throat as he thought of Liza: she was very unkind and ungrateful, and he wished he had never come to Chingford. She might so easily have come for a walk with him instead of going with that beast of a Blakeston; she wouldn\u0027t ever do anything for him, and he hated her--but all the same, he was a poor foolish thing in love, and he began to feel that perhaps he had been a little exacting and a little forward to take offence. And then he wished he had never said anything, and he wanted so much to see her and make it up. He made his way back to Chingford, hoping she would not make him wait too long.\\n\\n Liza was a little surprised when Tom turned and left them.\\n\\n \u0027Wot \u0027as \u0027e got the needle abaht?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Why, \u0027e\u0027s jealous,\u0027 answered Jim, with a laugh.\\n\\n \u0027Tom jealous?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus; \u0027e\u0027s jealous of me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, \u0027e ain\u0027t got no cause ter be jealous of anyone--that \u0027e ain\u0027t!\u0027 said Liza, and continued by telling him all about Tom: how he had wanted to marry her and she wouldn\u0027t have him, and how she had only agreed to come to Chingford with him on the understanding that she should preserve her entire freedom. Jim listened sympathetically, but his wife paid no attention; she was doubtless engaged in thought respecting her household or her family.\\n\\n When they got back to Chingford they saw Tom standing in solitude looking at them. Liza was struck by the woebegone expression on his face; she felt she had been cruel to him, and leaving the Blakestons went up to him.\\n\\n \u0027I say, Tom,\u0027 she said, \u0027don\u0027t tike on so; I didn\u0027t mean it.\u0027\\n\\n He was bursting to apologize for his behaviour.\\n\\n \u0027Yer know, Tom,\u0027 she went on, \u0027I\u0027m rather \u0027asty, an\u0027 I\u0027m sorry I said wot I did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Liza, you are good! You ain\u0027t cross with me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me? Na; it\u0027s you thet oughter be cross.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are a good sort, Liza!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You ain\u0027t vexed with me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Give me Liza every time; that\u0027s wot I say,\u0027 he answered, as his face lit up. \u0027Come along an\u0027 \u0027ave tea, an\u0027 then we\u0027ll go for a donkey-ride.\u0027\\n\\n The donkey-ride was a great success. Liza was a little afraid at first, so Tom walked by her side to take care of her, she screamed the moment the beast began to trot, and clutched hold of Tom to save herself from falling, and as he felt her hand on his shoulder, and heard her appealing cry: \u0027Oh, do \u0027old me! I\u0027m fallin\u0027!\u0027 he felt that he had never in his life been so deliciously happy. The whole party joined in, and it was proposed that they should have races; but in the first heat, when the donkeys broke into a canter, Liza fell off into Tom\u0027s arms and the donkeys scampered on without her.\\n\\n \u0027I know wot I\u0027ll do,\u0027 she said, when the runaway had been recovered. \u0027I\u0027ll ride \u0027im straddlewyse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn!\u0027 said Sally, \u0027yer can\u0027t with petticoats.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus, I can, an\u0027 I will too!\u0027\\n\\n So another donkey was procured, this time with a man\u0027s saddle, and putting her foot in the stirrup, she cocked her leg over and took her seat triumphantly. Neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be reckoned among Liza\u0027s faults, and in this position she felt quite at ease.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll git along arright now, Tom,\u0027 she said; \u0027you garn and git yerself a moke, and come an\u0027 jine in.\u0027\\n\\n The next race was perfectly uproarious. Liza kicked and beat her donkey with all her might, shrieking and laughing the white, and finally came in winner by a length. After that they felt rather warm and dry, and repaired to the public-house to restore themselves and talk over the excitements of the racecourse.\\n\\n When they had drunk several pints of beer Liza and Sally, with their respective adorers and the Blakestons, walked round to find other means of amusing themselves; they were arrested by a coconut-shy.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, let\u0027s \u0027ave a shy!\u0027 said Liza, excitedly, at which the unlucky men had to pull out their coppers, while Sally and Liza made ludicrously bad shots at the coconuts.\\n\\n \u0027It looks so bloomin\u0027 easy,\u0027 said Liza, brushing up her hair, \u0027but I can\u0027t \u0027it the blasted thing. You \u0027ave a shot, Tom.\u0027\\n\\n He and Harry were equally unskilful, but Jim got three coconuts running, and the proprietors of the show began to look on him with some concern.\\n\\n \u0027You are a dab at it,\u0027 said Liza, in admiration.\\n\\n They tried to induce Mrs. Blakeston to try her luck, but she stoutly refused.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t old with such foolishness. It\u0027s wiste of money ter me,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Na then, don\u0027t crack on, old tart,\u0027 remarked her husband, \u0027let\u0027s go an\u0027 eat the coconuts.\u0027\\n\\n There was one for each couple, and after the ladies had sucked the juice they divided them and added their respective shares to their dinners and teas. Supper came next. Again they fell to sausage-rolls, boiled eggs, and saveloys, and countless bottles of beer were added to those already drunk.\\n\\n \u0027I dunno \u0027ow many bottles of beer I\u0027ve drunk--I\u0027ve lost count,\u0027 said Liza; whereat there was a general laugh.\\n\\n They still had an hour before the brake was to start back, and it was then the concertinas came in useful. They sat down on the grass, and the concert was begun by Harry, who played a solo; then there was a call for a song, and Jim stood up and sang that ancient ditty, \u0027O dem Golden Kippers, O\u0027. There was no shyness in the company, and Liza, almost without being asked, gave another popular comic song. Then there was more concertina playing, and another demand for a song. Liza turned to Tom, who was sitting quietly by her side.\\n\\n \u0027Give us a song, old cock,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I\u0027m not a singin\u0027 sort.\u0027 At which Blakeston got up and offered to sing again.\\n\\n \u0027Tom is rather a soft,\u0027 said Liza to herself, \u0027not like that cove Blakeston.\u0027\\n\\n They repaired to the public-house to have a few last drinks before the brake started, and when the horn blew to warn them, rather unsteadily, they proceeded to take their places.\\n\\n Liza, as she scrambled up the steps, said: \u0027Well, I believe I\u0027m boozed.\u0027\\n\\n The coachman had arrived at the melancholy stage of intoxication, and was sitting on his box holding his reins, with his head bent on his chest. He was thinking sadly of the long-lost days of his youth, and wishing he had been a better man.\\n\\n Liza had no respect for such holy emotions, and she brought down her fist on the crown of his hat, and bashed it over his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Na then, old jellybelly,\u0027 she said, \u0027wot\u0027s the good of \u0027avin\u0027 a fice as long as a kite?\u0027\\n\\n He turned round and smote her.\\n\\n \u0027Jellybelly yerself!\u0027 said he.\\n\\n \u0027Puddin\u0027 fice!\u0027 she cried.\\n\\n \u0027Kite fice!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Boss eye!\u0027\\n\\n She was tremendously excited, laughing and singing, keeping the whole company in an uproar. In her jollity she had changed hats with Tom, and he in her big feathers made her shriek with laughter. When they started they began to sing \u0027For \u0027e\u0027s a jolly good feller\u0027, making the night resound with their noisy voices.\\n\\n Liza and Tom and the Blakestons had got a seat together, Liza being between the two men. Tom was perfectly happy, and only wished that they might go on so for ever. Gradually as they drove along they became quieter, their singing ceased, and they talked in undertones. Some of them slept; Sally and her young man were leaning up against one another, slumbering quite peacefully. The night was beautiful, the sky still blue, very dark, scattered over with countless brilliant stars, and Liza, as she looked up at the heavens, felt a certain emotion, as if she wished to be taken in someone\u0027s arms, or feel some strong man\u0027s caress; and there was in her heart a strange sensation as though it were growing big. She stopped speaking, and all four were silent. Then slowly she felt Tom\u0027s arm steal round her waist, cautiously, as though it were afraid of being there; this time both she and Tom were happy. But suddenly there was a movement on the other side of her, a hand was advanced along her leg, and her hand was grasped and gently pressed. It was Jim Blakeston. She started a little and began trembling so that Tom noticed it, and whispered:\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re cold, Liza.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na, I\u0027m not, Tom; it\u0027s only a sort of shiver thet went through me.\u0027\\n\\n His arm gave her waist a squeeze, and at the same time the big rough hand pressed her little one. And so she sat between them till they reached the \u0027Red Lion\u0027 in the Westminster Bridge Road, and Tom said to himself: \u0027I believe she does care for me after all.\u0027\\n\\n When they got down they all said good night, and Sally and Liza, with their respective slaves and the Blakestons, marched off homewards. At the corner of Vere Street Harry said to Tom and Blakeston:\\n\\n \u0027I say, you blokes, let\u0027s go an\u0027 \u0027ave another drink before closin\u0027 time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mind,\u0027 said Tom, \u0027after we\u0027ve took the gals \u0027ome.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then we shan\u0027t \u0027ave time, it\u0027s just on closin\u0027 time now.\u0027 answered Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we can\u0027t leave \u0027em \u0027ere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus, you can,\u0027 said Sally. \u0027No one\u0027ll run awy with us.\u0027\\n\\n Tom did not want to part from Liza, but she broke in with:\\n\\n \u0027Yus, go on, Tom. Sally an\u0027 me\u0027ll git along arright, an\u0027 you ain\u0027t got too much time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yus, good night, \u0027Arry,\u0027 said Sally to settle the matter.\\n\\n \u0027Good night, old gal,\u0027 he answered, \u0027give us another slobber.\u0027\\n\\n And she, not at all unwilling, surrendered herself to him, while he imprinted two sounding kisses on her cheeks.\\n\\n \u0027Good night, Tom,\u0027 said Liza, holding out her hand.\\n\\n \u0027Good night, Liza,\u0027 he answered, taking it, but looking very wistfully at her.\\n\\n She understood, and with a kindly smile lifted up her face to him. He bent down and, taking her in his arms, kissed her passionately.\\n\\n \u0027You do kiss nice, Liza,\u0027 he said, making the others laugh.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks for tikin\u0027 me aht, old man,\u0027 she said as they parted.\\n\\n \u0027Arright, Liza,\u0027 he answered, and added, almost to himself: \u0027God bless yer!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Ulloa, Blakeston, ain\u0027t you comin\u0027?\u0027 said Harry, seeing that Jim was walking off with his wife instead of joining him and Tom.\\n\\n \u0027Na,\u0027 he answered, \u0027I\u0027m goin\u0027 \u0027ome. I\u0027ve got ter be up at five ter-morrer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are a chap!\u0027 said Harry, disgustedly, strolling off with Tom to the pub, while the others made their way down the sleeping street.\\n\\n The house where Sally lived came first, and she left them; then, walking a few yards more, they came to the Blakestons\u0027, and after a little talk at the door Liza bade the couple good night, and was left to walk the rest of the way home. The street was perfectly silent, and the lamp-posts, far apart, threw a dim light which only served to make Lisa realize her solitude. There was such a difference between the street at midday, with its swarms of people, and now, when there was neither sound nor soul besides herself, that even she was struck by it. The regular line of houses on either side, with the even pavements and straight, cemented road, seemed to her like some desert place, as if everyone were dead, or a fire had raged and left it all desolate. Suddenly she heard a footstep, she started and looked back. It was a man hurrying behind her, and in a moment she had recognized Jim. He beckoned to her, and in a low voice called:\\n\\n \u0027Liza!\u0027\\n\\n She stopped till he had come up to her.\\n\\n \u0027Wot \u0027ave yer come aht again for?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve come aht ter say good night to you, Liza,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027But yer said good night a moment ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wanted to say it again--properly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s yer missus?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, she\u0027s gone in. I said I was dry and was goin\u0027 ter \u0027ave a drink after all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she\u0027ll know yer didn\u0027t go ter the pub.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Na, she won\u0027t, she\u0027s gone straight upstairs to see after the kid. I wanted ter see yer alone, Liza.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer, but tried to take hold of her hand. She drew it away quickly. They walked in silence till they came to Liza\u0027s house.\\n\\n \u0027Good night,\u0027 said Liza.\\n\\n \u0027Won\u0027t you come for a little walk, Liza?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tike care no one \u0027ears you,\u0027 she added, in a whisper, though why she whispered she did not know.\\n\\n \u0027Will yer?\u0027 he asked again.\\n\\n \u0027Na--you\u0027ve got to get up at five.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I only said thet not ter go inter the pub with them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So as yer might come \u0027ere with me?\u0027 asked Liza.\\n\\n \u0027Yus!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m not comin\u0027. Good night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, say good night nicely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wot d\u0027yer mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tom said you did kiss nice.\u0027\\n\\n She looked at him without speaking, and in a moment he had clasped his arms round her, almost lifting her off her feet, and kissed her. She turned her face away.\\n\\n \u0027Give us yer lips, Liza,\u0027 he whispered--\u0027give us yer lips.\u0027\\n\\n He turned her face without resistance and kissed her on the mouth.\\n\\n At last she tore herself from him, and opening the door slid away into the house.\\n\\n 丽莎坐定下来，就开始细看车上的每一个人，首先打量着吉姆·布莱克斯顿带着的那个女人。\\n\\n “这是我老婆！”吉姆用大拇指指着她说。\\n\\n “你不大到街上来吧？”丽莎兜搭上去。\\n\\n “不大上街，”布莱克斯顿太太回答，“我最小的孩子在发麻疹，我丢了工作在照看他。”\\n\\n “噢，他现在好了吗？”\\n\\n “好些了；今天吉姆要我到庆福去，他对我说：‘你也去吧，这对你有好处。，他又说：‘你可以让波莉在家里——波莉是我家的老大一可以让她在家照看孩子们”他这样说。所以我说：‘好吧，我就去。’’’\\n\\n 丽莎一直盯着她看。她先看她的衣着：她穿着一件黑色的外套，头上戴着一顶古怪的、老式的、黑色的无边帽子；然后端详着这个女人本身，她看她是中等身材，很强壮，年纪在三、四十岁之间。她长着一张又大又胖的脸，一张大嘴巴，头发做得很奇怪，中间分开，编成一条条小辫子，平贴在两边头上。你一看就知道她力大如牛，尽管明显地看得出她劳碌和生育繁多的痕迹。\\n\\n 其他的乘客丽莎都认识，现在大家坐定下来，动身时候的忙乱过去了，空下来彼此就招呼起来。他们有丽莎在一起，都很高兴，因为她到哪里，那里就有生气。第一个她注意到的是个卖水果的小贩，他穿着传统的服装——一套灰色西装，裤子包得紧紧的，周身上下钉满了亮晶晶的钮子。\\n\\n “多有劲，比尔！”丽莎大声对他说。\\n\\n “多有劲，丽莎！”他回答。\\n\\n “你打扮得这么漂亮，要把他们全压倒啦。’’\\n\\n “喂，喂，丽莎·肯普，”他的女伴假装火冒的样子对她说，“你不要跟我的宝贝拉拉扯扯。你搭上了他，我可要给你颜色看。”\\n\\n “好，克莱莉·夏普，我不要他，”丽莎回答她。“我自己也有，这事儿可够麻烦的，汤姆，对不对？”\\n\\n 汤姆听了很乐意，可是找不到一句机智的对话，只是用臂肘子对丽莎猛力撞了一下。\\n\\n “嗬——，你啊，”丽莎说，用手按在一边的腰里。“当心我的肋骨都要被你撞断啦。”\\n\\n “那不是你的肋骨，’’一个老实朋友说——“你是怕碰坏了你撑紧身衣的鲸骨。”\\n\\n “去你的！”\\n\\n “你紧身衣上装鲸骨吗？”汤姆问，一边假装天真，伸手到她腰里去摸。\\n\\n “喂，喂，”她说，“不要动手动脚！”\\n\\n “嗯，我只是想知道你那里面有没有鲸骨。”\\n\\n “去你的！别跟我耍花招。”\\n\\n 他还是不把手收回来。\\n\\n “喂，喂．”她重复说，“把手拿下。你要是碰了我那个，你就非娶我不可。”\\n\\n “我正是要娶你嘛，丽莎！”\\n\\n “闭嘴！”她凶狠地回答，同时把他的手从她腰里拉开去。\\n\\n 前面双马齐奔，后面吹喇叭的吹得起劲。\\n\\n “别吹炸了，老爷！”其中一个乘客听他吹出了一声特别刺耳的怪声来，对他说。\\n\\n 他们向前驶去，过了半个把小时，街路上渐渐热闹起来，来往车辆也多了。终于他们赶上了去庆福的大路，追上了一大批在向着同一方向行进的车辆——驴车、小马车、运输马车、单匹马拉的车、四轮大马车、游览马车，各种各式的车辆应有尽有，都坐满了人，一只瘦骨嶙峋的驴子拖着四个肥硕的上等市民的也有，两匹壮马轻松地拖着四十个人的也有。\\n\\n 他们一面行进，一面嘻嘻哈哈谈笑欢呼，红狮酒店的那辆四轮大马车喧闹得最引入注意。\\n\\n 早晨渐渐过去，太阳越来越猛烈，只觉路上尘土飞扬，热气蒸腾，越来越厉害。\\n\\n “我热死了！”这是普通的呼声，每个人都喘着气，流起汗来。\\n\\n 女的乘客们脱去外套和披肩，男的学她们样，也脱下外套，单穿着衬衫坐着。接着，拿每个人心里最好脱掉什么作话题，大开玩笑，越说越不象话。这说明正派、老实的英国人对法国闹剧中的那种暗示性的语言也不是想象的那么陌生的。\\n\\n 终于望见了那家中途客栈，两匹马可以停憩一会，用海绵擦洗一下。他们在过去的一里路程中一直谈着这家中途客栈，最后他们看到它出现在一个小山顶上，不由得欢呼起来，有个口渴得要命的爱开玩笑的人唱起了英国国歌，而另外有些人高声齐唱另一支同国歌一样为大家所熟悉的民歌《啤酒，啤酒万岁！》\\n\\n 马车到了酒店门口，人人争先恐后地爬下车子。酒店的柜台一下被占满了，男女侍者急忙拿啤酒端来给外面这些焦渴的来客。柯里登和菲丽丝的牧歌注\\n\\n 风流豪放要求忠实的放牛郎和多情的牧羊女从同一只酒罐里喝酒。\\n\\n “快来，你先喝，”柯里登彬彬有礼地捧起溢着泡沫的酒罐给他女伴喝。\\n\\n 菲丽丝不声不响把酒罐举到嘴唇边，开怀畅饮。牛郎瞧着，心里发急。\\n\\n “嗳，让我也喝一口！”他眼看酒罐越举越高，里面的酒好象越来越少，连忙说道。\\n\\n 多情的牧羊女停了下来，把酒罐递给她的情人。\\n\\n “哦，天晓得！”柯里登朝罐子里看看，这样说道，接着又说，“我想你总懂得的。”于是他雍容大方地把自己的嘴唇贴在他心上人的嘴唇刚才贴过处，喝完了这一品脱的啤酒。\\n\\n “天哪！”牧羊女咂咂嘴说，“真够味儿！”她又伸出舌头，舔舔嘴唇，然后深深地吸了口气。\\n\\n 忠实的放牛郎喝完后，长叹一声，说道一\\n\\n “嗳，我还能喝些！”\\n\\n “你说这个呀，我还能大口地好好喝些呢！’’\\n\\n 殷勤的牛郎受到鼓励，就回到柜台上，立即又拿来了一品脱。\\n\\n “你先喝．”菲丽丝情意绵绵地说。柯里登一连喝了几口，把酒罐递给菲丽丝。\\n\\n 她，由于少女的羞怯，把罐子转了一下，想要换一边喝；但是他看了说——\\n\\n “你怪别扭的。”\\n\\n 她为了不要使他不高兴，仍把罐子转过来，红宝石般鲜艳的嘴唇按上了他的嘴唇按过的地方。\\n\\n “时间差不多了！”她说，一边把酒罐交还给他。\\n\\n 忠实的牛郎从口袋里掏出一支短短的陶土烟斗，吹吹通，装满了烟丝，开始抽起烟来；而菲丽丝想着冰凉的清液在喉咙里往下淌去的味儿，觉得回味无穷，叹息一声，轻轻地抚摸着肚子。\\n\\n 这时候柯里登吐了一口唾液，他的情侣立刻说——\\n\\n “我能吐得比你远。”\\n\\n “我肯定你不能。”\\n\\n 她试了，果然吐得比他远。他使了劲再吐，比原来的远，她也再吐，他们一直进行着这牧歌式的竞赛，直到嘟嘟的喇叭声叫他们准备各就各位。\\n\\n 最后，他们到达了庆福，马解了下来，车子拖到一个有遮盖的地方，待会儿要在这里进午餐。\\n\\n 他们都相当饿了，可是现在还没到吃饭的时候，他们就先分散去喝一点什么。丽莎和汤姆，跟萨莉和她的男朋友，一起到了附近一家小酒店。\\n\\n 他们在喝啤酒的时候，哈利——他是个运动好手，有声有色地讲给他们听，他在上星期六晚上看到的一场职业拳击赛，特别令人难忘的是一个人被打伤得厉害，结果死掉了。这当然是一场非常精采的表演。哈利说那天来了几个西区的时髦人士，他讲他们偷偷地溜进来的可笑样子，还讲了有个人故意吓他们，哇的一声“买票！”把他们吓得魂飞魄散的那副狼狈相。\\n\\n 接着，汤姆和他在拳击问题上争论起来。汤姆羞羞答答的，又不会一篇大道理，根本不是哈利的对手。\\n\\n 后来他们一起散步回到四轮大马车那儿，只见他们正在准备午餐；一只只大篮子在搬出来，从篮子里拿出吃的、喝的，看着一瓶瓶啤酒，叫那些干渴的嘴巴更干渴。\\n\\n “来啊，女士们，先生们——如果你们确是上等先生的话．”马车夫喊道，“现在要喂牲口了！”\\n\\n “滚开，”有人呵斥他，“我们可不是牲口；我们不喝水。”\\n\\n “你太聪明了，”马车夫说；“我看得出你是刚从公立小学校出来的。”\\n\\n 前面说话的那个是个模样已经是半老的女人，所以他这样回答她的话里不无小小的讽刺。\\n\\n 另一个人吹着喇叭表示感谢上帝，丽莎提高了嗓门对他说“别吹啦；你要炸掉了，我看你准要炸掉。你一炸，我们的午餐就扫兴了！”\\n\\n 这会儿他们开始进午餐了。猪肉饼，咸味香肠，淡味香肠，冷土豆，鸡蛋，冷咸肉，小牛肉，火腿，虾，蟹，干酪，黄油，浇糖蜜的板油布丁，醋栗馅饼，樱桃馅饼，黄油面包，又是香肠，又是猪肉饼！\\n\\n 他们狼吞虎咽，拼命地、默不作声地、专心一志地、大口大口把各式各样吃的东西尽往喉咙里塞。有知识的外国人看到他们这样吃东西，就会懂得为什么英国能成为强大的国家。他会懂得为什么英国人永远、永远不会做奴隶。\\n\\n 他们尽是吃，除非停下来喝酒；喝起酒来，一杯一口干，不剩一点底！他们尽是吃呀，喝呀，然而任何事情都必然有终止的时候，他们终究结束了，三十二个喉咙里都发出了满足的长叹。\\n\\n 然后聚餐散场，这些善良的人们各自一对对走开去了。\\n\\n 哈利和他的女伴散步拐进了森林注中隐蔽的小径里，去谈情说爱，消化他们的这顿午餐。\\n\\n 汤姆整个上午一直等待着这个时刻的到来。他相信吃得饱饱的肚子一定有助于消融丽莎的冷漠。他想象自己坐在草地上，背靠着一棵枝叶茂盛的栗树的树干，手臂揽着他的丽莎的腰，她的头温柔地倒在他男性的胸窝里。丽莎也预料到午餐后大家要一对对分开，所以动足脑筋要设法逃避这个情况。\\n\\n “我不要他缠着我，’’她说；“接吻呀，拥抱呀，这些都叫我嫌恶！”\\n\\n 她自己也不懂，为什么她不要他爱抚，可是他的爱抚就是使她讨厌．惹她生气。幸亏上帝赐福的婚姻制度帮她的忙，因为吉姆·布莱克斯顿和他妻子自然不大愿意两个人在一起度过这个下午；丽莎看到他们俩都有点尴尬的样子，就建议她跟他们一起到森林里去散步。\\n\\n 吉姆答应得快，而且表示十分乐意；汤姆却大失所望。他没有勇气说什么话，只是对布莱克斯顿瞪着眼睛。吉姆对他满不在乎地笑笑，而汤姆绷起了脸。\\n\\n 他们就这样开始了在森林里的蹊跷的散步。\\n\\n 吉姆尽量要跟丽莎走在一起，丽莎对此丝毫不觉反感，因为她已经得出这样的结论，认为吉姆虽然“老面皮”，却决不是“坏东西”。但是汤姆走在他们旁边。吉姆稍微加快些步子，使丽莎走到前面去，汤姆也加快步子，布莱克斯顿太太不愿落在后面，不得不连走带奔地保持跟他们并排着。\\n\\n 吉姆还尽量要使丽莎只跟他一个人谈话，让汤姆觉得被冷搁着，但是汤姆偏要插入几句生硬的憋气的话，徒使其余的人都不愉快。丽莎终于对他恼火了。\\n\\n “我看你准是今天一早起来见了鬼，”她对他说。\\n\\n “你答应跟我一起来的时候，没有这么想吧。”他把这个“我”字说得特别重。\\n\\n 丽莎耸耸肩膀。\\n\\n “你使我扫兴，”她说。“你要让自己做傻瓜的话，你到别处去做傻瓜好了。”\\n\\n “你这是叫我走开口罗。”他愤愤地说。\\n\\n “我没说我要你走开。”\\n\\n “好，丽莎，我不要呆在不要我呆着的地方。”说着他旋转脚跟，冲着擦着他身子的矮树丛的枝丫，大步向森林的深处走去。\\n\\n 他一面信步走去，一面无限地悲怆，想着丽莎，喉咙口有窒息的感觉：她太无情无义，他懊悔到庆福来的。她完全可以和他散散步，而不去跟布莱克斯顿那个畜生一起走的；她就是不肯对他好好的，他恨她——然而他又自认毕竟是爱情中的自私的可怜虫，他开始感到也许是自己太苛求了些，太容易生气了些。他因此又悔恨自己本该一句话都不说的，他是多么想到她面前去赔不是。他又回头向庆福走，希望她不要让他等得太久。\\n\\n 当汤姆转身离开他们的时候，丽莎有点诧异。\\n\\n “他生什么气？”她说。\\n\\n “什么气，妒忌嘛，”吉姆笑着回答。\\n\\n “汤姆妒忌？’’\\n\\n “是呀，他妒忌我，”\\n\\n “怎么，他没有理由妒忌任何人——他没有理由！”丽莎说，接下来她把关于汤姆的一切都告诉了他：他如何要娶她而她不要他，她又是如何跟他讲好保留完全的自由，才答应跟他一起到庆福来的。\\n\\n 吉姆同情地听着，但是他妻子却不闻不问，无疑是一心惦念着她的家或者她的孩子们。\\n\\n 他们回到庆福的时候，看见汤姆孤单单站在那里瞧着他们。丽莎看见他脸上沮丧的神情，心中有所感动，觉得自己待他太冷酷无情，于是离开了布莱克斯顿夫妇，走到他跟前。\\n\\n “嗳，汤姆，”她说，“别那么放在心上；我并不是有心惹你不高兴。”\\n\\n 他拼命对自己的行为表示抱歉。\\n\\n “你知道．汤姆，”她继续说，“我太急躁，我不该说了刚才的话，对不起你。”\\n\\n “噢，丽莎，你真好！你没生我的气吗？”\\n\\n “我？不；该是你生我的气。”\\n\\n “你真是个好姑娘，丽莎！”\\n\\n “你不生我的气吗？”\\n\\n “让我始终跟丽莎在一起；这就是我说的，”他说着，脸上闪现出喜悦的光芒。“我们去吃茶点，回头再去骑驴子。”\\n\\n 骑驴子玩得很开心。\\n\\n 丽莎开头有点害怕，所以汤姆走在她旁边当心她。那牲畜一开始小步跑起来的时候，她尖声叫了，紧紧抓住汤姆，生怕摔倒下来。他感觉到她的手搁在他肩胛上，听她动人地叫喊“噢，抱住我，我要掉下来了！”他觉得一生从没有这样甜美地快乐过。\\n\\n 一伙人全来骑驴子了。他们建议来骑驴比赛。但是在第一场比赛中，驴子一跑动，丽莎就跌倒在汤姆怀里，驴子独自蹦跳着继续向前跑去了。\\n\\n “我知道我该怎么骑了，”她在跑掉的驴子被迫了回来之后说，“我跨着骑。”\\n\\n “胡说！”萨莉说，“你穿着裙子怎么行？”\\n\\n “行，我能行；我偏要跨着骑！”\\n\\n 于是，另外弄来了一头驴子，这回是装着给男人骑的鞍子。她把脚套进铁镫，翘起腿来，一跃而得意地在鞍子上坐下了。丽莎是不怕羞的；她跨骑在鞍上十分自在。\\n\\n “这回我行了，汤姆，”她说，“你也去弄头驴子来，一起参加。”\\n\\n 这一回的比赛可热闹了。\\n\\n 丽莎使劲踢着、用鞭子抽着她的驴子，同时又是尖叫，又是大笑，最后她把人家甩了一大段，获得了胜利。\\n\\n 这场比赛之后，大伙又热又渴，都到小酒店去休息，谈论赛驴子的盛况。\\n\\n 他们喝了几品脱啤酒之后，丽莎和萨莉，同她们各自的爱慕者，还有布莱克斯顿夫妻俩，一起周围兜兜，寻找有什么其他的游乐，他们被投椰子的玩意吸引住了。\\n\\n “好，我们来投一下！”丽莎兴奋地说，这就得那些倒霉的男人掏出些铜币来。萨莉和丽莎对着椰子投去，可都不知偏到什么地方去了，叫人好笑。\\n\\n “看看怪容易的，”丽莎说，把头发往上一掠，“可我却投不中那个该死的东西。你投投看，汤姆。”\\n\\n 他和哈利同样都不高明，然而吉姆一连投中三只椰子。摆摊子的人看着他，有点急起来。\\n\\n “你可是个能手，”丽莎赞扬他。\\n\\n 他们想要叫布莱克斯顿太太也试试运气，但是她坚决不干。\\n\\n “我不赞成做这种蠢事。我只认为是白费钱，”她说。\\n\\n “那么，别唠叨了，老太婆，”她丈夫说，“我们来吃椰子吧。”\\n\\n 三只椰子正好每一对拿一只，在女的吮吸干了椰子汁之后，他们把椰子切开，各自留些在吃饭、吃点心的时候吃。\\n\\n 进晚餐了。他们重又大吃香肠卷，鸡蛋，咸香肠；一瓶瓶啤酒喝完又来，来了又喝。\\n\\n “我不知喝了多少瓶啤酒——我都数不清了，’’丽莎说，引起哄然大笑。\\n\\n 他们还有一个小时，四轮大马车就要掉头回去了，这时候手风琴派用处了。\\n\\n 他们在草地上坐下，音乐会由哈利开场，他拉了个独奏曲；接着大家喊着要求唱支歌。吉姆站起身来，唱了那支古老的《啊，金色的小伙子，啊！》在这一群伙伴中间不存在忸忸怩怩，所以丽莎几乎自告奋勇地也唱了一支流行的喜剧歌曲。随后又是手风琴演奏，和要求唱支歌的叫喊。\\n\\n 丽莎转身对默默坐在她旁边的汤姆说一\\n\\n “给我们唱支歌，老朋友。”\\n\\n “我不会唱，”他回答说。“我不会唱歌。”他正在说这个话，吉姆站了起来，说他再来唱一个。\\n\\n “汤姆真是个脓包，”丽莎心想，“不象布莱克斯顿那个家伙。”\\n\\n 他们又一齐到小酒店，在马车上路之前，最后再喝几杯，直到喇叭发出有些抖动的嘟嘟声，催大伙上车，他们才在车上一个个坐下。\\n\\n 丽莎在爬上马车梯级的时候说，“唷，我看我喝醉了。”\\n\\n 马车夫已经喝得醉到感伤的境地，坐在驾驶座上，手执缰绳，头耷拉在胸前。他悲怆地回想着他早巳消逝的年轻时代，懊悔当初没做个更好的人。\\n\\n 丽莎并不尊重这种神圣的感情，她伸出拳头在他帽子顶上啪的一下，帽子压没了他的眼睛。\\n\\n “喂，老混蛋，”她说，“你把脸拉得风筝那么长干吗呀？”\\n\\n 他回过头来骂她——\\n\\n “你自己混蛋！”\\n\\n “死面团样的脸！”她嚷道。\\n\\n “风筝脸！”\\n\\n “斗鸡眼！”\\n\\n 她兴奋得不得了，大笑大唱，把整个这伙人引得闹成一片喧嚣。她在欢乐中拿汤姆的帽子戴在自己头上，把自己的帽子戴在汤姆头上，汤姆戴着她那顶插满羽毛的大帽子，她笑得尖声怪叫起来。\\n\\n 他们的车子开动的时候，大家唱起《原来他是一个大好人》．喧闹的歌声响彻夜空。\\n\\n 丽莎和汤姆和布莱克斯顿夫妇坐在一排位子上，丽莎坐在汤姆和布莱克斯顿中间。汤姆开心极厂，但愿他们能一直这样下去。\\n\\n 车子一路驶去，他们渐渐静了下来，歌不唱了，说话也压低着声音。他们中间有的睡着了；萨莉和她的情人相互偎依，安稳地打着瞌睡。\\n\\n 夜色美妙，天上还是一片蔚蓝，很暗，散布着无数闪烁的明星。丽莎仰望天空，感到一种激动的心情，仿佛但愿被抱在什么人的怀里，或者感受什么强壮的男人的抚爱。她心中有种奇异的似乎在膨胀的感觉。\\n\\n 她停止了说话，他们四个人都不作声。\\n\\n 后来，慢慢地她觉得汤姆的手臂在偷偷向她腰里伸过来，小心翼翼地，似乎又怕伸在那里；这会儿她和汤姆都乐滋滋的。\\n\\n 但是，忽然她另外一边有什么在蠕动，一只手在她腿上伸过来，她的手被握住，被轻轻地挤捏着。那是吉姆·布莱克斯顿。她吃了一惊，发起抖来，汤姆觉得她在发抖，便在她耳边低声问她——\\n\\n “你冷啦，丽莎。”\\n\\n “不，我不冷，汤姆；只是身上一阵哆嗦。”\\n\\n 他的手在她腰里扭了一把，同时另一边的那只粗壮的大手捏捏她的小手。\\n\\n 她就这样坐在他们两个的中间，直到到达威斯敏斯特桥大道的红狮酒店。汤姆心想，“我相信她毕竟是对我有意思的。”\\n\\n 大伙下了马车，彼此互道晚安分手。萨莉和丽莎，同她们各自的奴隶和布莱克斯顿夫妻俩一起朝回家的路上走。到维尔街转角上，哈利对汤姆和布莱克斯顿说一\\n\\n “我说，伙计们，让我们趁酒店没打烊之前再去喝一杯。”\\n\\n “我没意见．”汤姆说，“不过我们得先把姑娘们送回了家。”\\n\\n “那来不及，现在正快打烊了，”哈利回答。\\n\\n “可我们不能就在这里丢下她们啊。”\\n\\n “没事，你们去好了，”萨莉说。“没有人会带我们跑掉的。”\\n\\n 汤姆不愿离开丽莎，但是丽莎插上来说——\\n\\n “对，你们去，汤姆。萨莉和我会好好自己回去的；你们没有太多时间了，赶紧去吧。”\\n\\n “好吧，明天见，哈利，”萨莉说，事情就这样定下来了。\\n\\n “明天见，好姑娘，”他说，“再给我亲一下。”\\n\\n 萨莉毫不犹豫地凑上前去，让他在她两边面颊上咂咂地亲了两个吻。\\n\\n “明天见，汤姆，”丽莎说着，伸出手去。\\n\\n “明天见，丽莎，”他回答，一面握住她的手，可是非常尴尬地瞧着她。\\n\\n 她懂得，于是和蔼地一笑，抬起脸蛋向着他。他俯身把她抱在怀里，热烈地吻她。\\n\\n “你吻得真好，丽莎，”他这样说，惹得旁边的人都笑了起来。\\n\\n “谢谢你带我出外玩，好朋友，”她在分手时说。\\n\\n “没什么，丽莎，”他回答，然后几乎自言自语地加了一句：“上帝保佑你！’’\\n\\n “喂，布莱克斯顿，你一起去吗？’’哈利看见吉姆不跟他们合在一起而跟他妻子一起走了，问他。\\n\\n “不．”他回答说，“我回家去r．我明天五点钟就得起床。”\\n\\n “你这家伙！”哈利扫兴地说，随即和汤姆一同走了，其余的人沿着这沉睡的小街回家去。\\n\\n 萨莉先到家，她离开了他们；他们再走几步，到了布莱克斯顿家门口，站定下来谈了几句，丽莎向这对夫妇道了晚安，剩下自己一个人在路上走。\\n\\n 街上静悄悄的，一支支灯柱相隔很远，投下微弱的光线徒使丽莎倍感孤独。此刻的街道和白天完全两个样子，白天街上全是人群，此刻除了她自己之外，不见一个人影，也没有半点声息，连她都害怕起来。眼前两边房屋平整的线条、截齐的人行道、笔直的马路，她只觉得似乎是个荒无人烟的地方，仿佛所有的人都死了，或者一场大火已经把它变成一片废墟。\\n\\n 突然她听到脚步声，一吓，回头看去，原来有个人在背后急急赶来。她一下子就认出那是吉姆。\\n\\n 他向她招手，低声叫唤——\\n\\n “丽莎！”\\n\\n 她站定下来，等他走到她面前。\\n\\n “你又跑来干吗？”她问。\\n\\n “我出来跟你说‘明天见’的，丽莎”，他答道。\\n\\n “可你刚才不是已经说过了吗？”\\n\\n “我要重说一遍——正正式式地。”\\n\\n “你老婆呢？”\\n\\n “哦，她回家了。我说我口渴，还要最后喝杯酒。”\\n\\n “但是她会知道你不是去小酒店的。”\\n\\n “不’她不会知道；她已经一路上楼去照看孩子了。我要单独见到你。’’\\n\\n “为什么？”\\n\\n 他不答话，却想要握住她的手。她迅速把手缩回。他们默默无言地往前走，直到丽莎家门口。\\n\\n “明天见．”丽莎说。\\n\\n “不跟我散一会步吗，丽莎？”\\n\\n “当心别让人听见你，”她在他耳朵边小声地说，虽然她自己也不知道为什么要这样。\\n\\n “你去吗？”他又问了一遍。\\n\\n “不——你五点钟就得起床的。”\\n\\n “噢，我说这个，只是为了不跟他们一起到小酒店去。”\\n\\n “就是为了可以到这里来找我一起去散步吗？”丽莎问他。\\n\\n “正是！”\\n\\n “不，我不去。明天见。”\\n\\n “呃，你要好好地说‘明天见’呀。”\\n\\n “你是什么意思？”\\n\\n “汤姆说你吻得真好。”\\n\\n 她瞧着他不说话，他一下把她紧紧搂抱住，几乎把她提起到双脚离了地，亲吻着她。她把脸掉开些。\\n\\n “给我亲你的嘴，丽莎．”他小声地说——“给我亲你的嘴。”\\n\\n 他把她的脸旋回过来，丽莎并不推避，他亲了她的嘴。\\n\\n 最后，她挣脱了他，倏地开门溜进了屋里去。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/318/152.html","bookId":160,"book":{"id":160,"title":"兰贝斯的丽莎 Liza of Lambeth","description":"简介： Liza of
