{"id":4574,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"About the middle of the night Liza woke; her mouth was hot and dry, and a sharp, cutting pain passed through her head as she moved. Her mother had evidently roused herself, for she was lying in bed by her side, partially undressed, with all the bedclothes rolled round her. Liza shivered in the cold night, and taking off some of her things--her boots, her skirt, and jacket--got right into bed; she tried to get some of the blanket from her mother, but as she pulled Mrs. Kemp gave a growl in her sleep and drew the clothes more tightly round her. So Liza put over herself her skirt and a shawl, which was lying over the end of the bed, and tried to go to sleep. But she could not; her head and hands were broiling hot, and she was terribly thirsty; when she lifted herself up to get a drink of water such a pang went through her head that she fell back on the bed groaning, and lay there with beating heart. And strange pains that she did not know went through her. Then a cold shiver seemed to rise in the very marrow of her bones and run down every artery and vein, freezing the blood; her skin puckered up, and drawing up her legs she lay huddled together in a heap, the shawl wrapped tightly round her, and her teeth chattering. Shivering, she whispered: \u0027Oh, I\u0027m so cold, so cold. Mother, give me some clothes; I shall die of the cold. Oh, I\u0027m freezing!\u0027 But after awhile the cold seemed to give way, and a sudden heat seized her, flushing her face, making her break out into perspiration, so that she threw everything off and loosened the things about her neck. \u0027Give us a drink,\u0027 she said. \u0027Oh, I\u0027d give anythin\u0027 for a little drop of water!\u0027 There was no one to hear; Mrs. Kemp continued to sleep heavily, occasionally breaking out into a little snore. Liza remained there, now shivering with cold, now panting for breath, listening to the regular, heavy breathing by her side, and in her pain she sobbed. She pulled at her pillow and said: \u0027Why can\u0027t I go to sleep? Why can\u0027t I sleep like \u0027er?\u0027 And the darkness was awful; it was a heavy, ghastly blackness, that seemed palpable, so that it frightened her and she looked for relief at the faint light glimmering through the window from a distant street-lamp. She thought the night would never end--the minutes seemed like hours, and she wondered how she should live through till morning. And strange pains that she did not know went through her. Still the night went on, the darkness continued, cold and horrible, and her mother breathed loudly and steadily by her side. At last with the morning sleep came; but the sleep was almost worse than the wakefulness, for it was accompanied by ugly, disturbing dreams. Liza thought she was going through the fight with her enemy, and Mrs. Blakeston grew enormous in size, and multiplied, so that every way she turned the figure confronted her. And she began running away, and she ran and ran till she found herself reckoning up an account she had puzzled over in the morning, and she did it backwards and forwards, upwards and downwards, starting here, starting there, and the figures got mixed up with other things, and she had to begin over again, and everything jumbled up, and her head whirled, till finally, with a start, she woke. The darkness had given way to a cold, grey dawn, her uncovered legs were chilled to the bone, and by her side she heard again the regular, nasal breathing of the drunkard. For a long while she lay where she was, feeling very sick and ill, but better than in the night. At last her mother woke. \u0027Liza!\u0027 she called. \u0027Yus, mother,\u0027 she answered feebly. \u0027Git us a cup of tea, will yer?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t, mother, I\u0027m ill.\u0027 \u0027Garn!\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp, in surprise. Then looking at her: \u0027Swop me bob, wot\u0027s up with yer? Why, yer cheeks is flushed, an\u0027 yer forehead--it is \u0027ot! Wot\u0027s the matter with yer, gal?\u0027 \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Liza. \u0027I\u0027ve been thet bad all night, I thought I was goin\u0027 ter die.\u0027 \u0027I know wot it is,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp, shaking her head; \u0027the fact is, you ain\u0027t used ter drinkin\u0027, an\u0027 of course it\u0027s upset yer. Now me, why I\u0027m as fresh as a disy. Tike my word, there ain\u0027t no good in teetotalism; it finds yer aht in the end, an\u0027 it\u0027s found you aht.\u0027 Mrs. Kemp considered it a judgment of Providence. She got up and mixed some whisky and water. \u0027\u0027Ere, drink this,\u0027 she said. \u0027When one\u0027s \u0027ad a drop too much at night, there\u0027s nothin\u0027 like havin\u0027 a drop more in the mornin\u0027 ter put one right. It just acts like magic.\u0027 \u0027Tike it awy,\u0027 said Liza, turning from it in disgust; \u0027the smell of it gives me the sick. I\u0027ll never touch spirits again.\u0027 \u0027Ah, thet\u0027s wot we all says sometime in our lives, but we does, an\u0027 wot\u0027s more we can\u0027t do withaht it. Why, me, the \u0027ard life I\u0027ve \u0027ad--.\u0027 It is unnecessary to repeat Mrs. Kemp\u0027s repetitions. Liza did not get up all day. Tom came to inquire after her, and was told she was very ill. Liza plaintively asked whether anyone else had been, and sighed a little when her mother answered no. But she felt too ill to think much or trouble much about anything. The fever came again as the day wore on, and the pains in her head grew worse. Her mother came to bed, and quickly went off to sleep, leaving Liza to bear her agony alone. She began to have frightful pains all over her, and she held her breath to prevent herself from crying out and waking her mother. She clutched the sheets in her agony, and at last, about six o\u0027clock in the morning, she could bear it no longer, and in the anguish of labour screamed out, and woke her mother. Mrs. Kemp was frightened out of her wits. Going upstairs she woke the woman who lived on the floor above her. Without hesitating, the good lady put on a skirt and came down. \u0027She\u0027s \u0027ad a miss,\u0027 she said, after looking at Liza. \u0027Is there anyone you could send to the \u0027orspital?\u0027 \u0027Na, I dunno \u0027oo I could get at this hour?\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027ll git my old man ter go.\u0027 She called her husband, and sent him off. She was a stout, middle-aged woman, rough-visaged and strong-armed. Her name was Mrs. Hodges. \u0027It\u0027s lucky you came ter me,\u0027 she said, when she had settled down. \u0027I go aht nursin\u0027, yer know, so I know all abaht it.\u0027 \u0027Well, you surprise me,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp. \u0027I didn\u0027t know as Liza was thet way. She never told me nothin\u0027 abaht it.\u0027 \u0027D\u0027yer know \u0027oo it is \u0027as done it?\u0027 \u0027Now you ask me somethin\u0027 I don\u0027t know,\u0027 replied Mrs. Kemp. \u0027But now I come ter think of it, it must be thet there Tom. \u0027E\u0027s been keepin\u0027 company with Liza. \u0027E\u0027s a single man, so they\u0027ll be able ter get married--thet\u0027s somethin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027It ain\u0027t Tom,\u0027 feebly said Liza. \u0027Not \u0027im; \u0027oo is it, then?\u0027 Liza did not answer. \u0027Eh?\u0027 repeated the mother, \u0027\u0027oo is it?\u0027 Liza lay still without speaking. \u0027Never mind, Mrs. Kemp,\u0027 said Mrs. Hodges, \u0027don\u0027t worry \u0027er now; you\u0027ll be able ter find aht all abaht it when she gits better.\u0027 For a while the two women sat still, waiting the doctor\u0027s coming, and Liza lay gazing vacantly at the wall, panting for breath. Sometimes Jim crossed her mind, and she opened her mouth to call for him, but in her despair she restrained herself. The doctor came. \u0027D\u0027you think she\u0027s bad, doctor?\u0027 asked Mrs. Hodges. \u0027I\u0027m afraid she is rather,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I\u0027ll come in again this evening.\u0027 \u0027Oh, doctor,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp, as he was going, \u0027could yer give me somethin\u0027 for my rheumatics? I\u0027m a martyr to rheumatism, an\u0027 these cold days I \u0027ardly knows wot ter do with myself. An\u0027, doctor, could you let me \u0027ave some beef-tea? My \u0027usbind\u0027s dead, an\u0027 of course I can\u0027t do no work with my daughter ill like this, an\u0027 we\u0027re very short--.\u0027 The day passed, and in the evening Mrs. Hodges, who had been attending to her own domestic duties, came downstairs again. Mrs. Kemp was on the bed sleeping. \u0027I was just \u0027avin\u0027 a little nap,\u0027 she said to Mrs. Hodges, on waking. \u0027\u0027Ow is the girl?\u0027 asked that lady. \u0027Oh,\u0027 answered Mrs. Kemp, \u0027my rheumatics \u0027as been thet bad I really \u0027aven\u0027t known wot ter do with myself, an\u0027 now Liza can\u0027t rub me I\u0027m worse than ever. It is unfortunate thet she should get ill just now when I want so much attendin\u0027 ter myself, but there, it\u0027s just my luck!\u0027 Mrs. Hodges went over and looked at Liza; she was lying just as when she left in the morning, her cheeks flushed, her mouth open for breath, and tiny beads of sweat stood on her forehead. \u0027\u0027Ow are yer, ducky?\u0027 asked Mrs. Hodges; but Liza did not answer. \u0027It\u0027s my belief she\u0027s unconscious,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp. \u0027I\u0027ve been askin\u0027 \u0027er \u0027oo it was as done it, but she don\u0027t seem to \u0027ear wot I say. It\u0027s been a great shock ter me, Mrs. \u0027Odges.\u0027 \u0027I believe you,\u0027 replied that lady, sympathetically. \u0027Well, when you come in and said wot it was, yer might \u0027ave knocked me dahn with a feather. I knew no more than the dead wot \u0027ad \u0027appened.\u0027 \u0027I saw at once wot it was,\u0027 said Mrs. Hodges, nodding her head. \u0027Yus, of course, you knew. I expect you\u0027ve \u0027ad a great deal of practice one way an\u0027 another.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right, Mrs. Kemp, you\u0027re right. I\u0027ve been on the job now for nearly twenty years, an\u0027 if I don\u0027t know somethin\u0027 abaht it I ought.\u0027 \u0027D\u0027yer finds it pays well?\u0027 \u0027Well, Mrs. Kemp, tike it all in all, I ain\u0027t got no grounds for complaint. I\u0027m in the \u0027abit of askin\u0027 five shillings, an\u0027 I will say this, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s too much for wot I do.\u0027 The news of Liza\u0027s illness had quickly spread, and more than once in the course of the day a neighbour had come to ask after her. There was a knock at the door now, and Mrs. Hodges opened it. Tom stood on the threshold asking to come in. \u0027Yus, you can come,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp. He advanced on tiptoe, so as to make no noise, and for a while stood silently looking at Liza. Mrs. Hodges was by his side. \u0027Can I speak to \u0027er?\u0027 he whispered. \u0027She can\u0027t \u0027ear you.\u0027 He groaned. \u0027D\u0027yer think she\u0027ll get arright?\u0027 he asked. Mrs. Hodges shrugged her shoulders. \u0027I shouldn\u0027t like ter give an opinion,\u0027 she said, cautiously. Tom bent over Liza, and, blushing, kissed her; then, without speaking further, went out of the room. \u0027Thet\u0027s the young man as was courtin\u0027 \u0027er,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp, pointing over her shoulder with her thumb. Soon after the Doctor came. \u0027Wot do yer think of \u0027er, doctor?\u0027 said Mrs. Hodges, bustling forwards authoritatively in her position of midwife and sick-nurse. \u0027I\u0027m afraid she\u0027s very bad.\u0027 \u0027D\u0027yer think she\u0027s goin\u0027 ter die?\u0027 she asked, dropping her voice to a whisper. \u0027I\u0027m afraid so!\u0027 As the doctor sat down by Liza\u0027s side Mrs. Hodges turned round and significantly nodded to Mrs. Kemp, who put her handkerchief to her eyes. Then she went outside to the little group waiting at the door. \u0027Wot does the doctor sy?\u0027 they asked, among them Tom. \u0027\u0027E says just wot I\u0027ve been sayin\u0027 all along; I knew she wouldn\u0027t live.\u0027 And Tom burst out: \u0027Oh, Liza!\u0027 As she retired a woman remarked: \u0027Mrs. \u0027Odges is very clever, I think.\u0027 \u0027Yus,\u0027 remarked another, \u0027she got me through my last confinement simply wonderful. If it come to choosin\u0027 between \u0027em I\u0027d back Mrs. \u0027Odges against forty doctors.\u0027 \u0027Ter tell yer the truth, so would I. I\u0027ve never known \u0027er wrong yet.\u0027 Mrs. Hodges sat down beside Mrs. Kemp and proceeded to comfort her. \u0027Why don\u0027t yer tike a little drop of brandy ter calm yer nerves, Mrs. Kemp?\u0027 she said, \u0027you want it.\u0027 \u0027I was just feelin\u0027 rather faint, an\u0027 I couldn\u0027t \u0027elp thinkin\u0027 as \u0027ow twopenneth of whisky \u0027ud do me good.\u0027 \u0027Na, Mrs. Kemp,\u0027 said Mrs. Hodges, earnestly, putting her hand on the other\u0027s arm. \u0027You tike my tip--when you\u0027re queer there\u0027s nothin\u0027 like brandy for pullin\u0027 yer togither. I don\u0027t object to whisky myself, but as a medicine yer can\u0027t beat brandy.\u0027 \u0027Well, I won\u0027t set up myself as knowin\u0027 better than you Mrs. \u0027Odges; I\u0027ll do wot you think right.\u0027 Quite accidentally there was some in the room, and Mrs. Kemp poured it out for herself and her friend. \u0027I\u0027m not in the \u0027abit of tikin\u0027 anythin\u0027 when I\u0027m aht on business,\u0027 she apologized, \u0027but just ter keep you company I don\u0027t mind if I do.\u0027 \u0027Your \u0027ealth. Mrs. \u0027Odges.\u0027 \u0027Sime ter you, an\u0027 thank yer, Mrs. Kemp.\u0027 Liza lay still, breathing very quietly, her eyes closed. The doctor kept his fingers on her pulse. \u0027I\u0027ve been very unfortunate of lite,\u0027 remarked Mrs. Hodges, as she licked her lips, \u0027this mikes the second death I\u0027ve \u0027ad in the last ten days--women, I mean, of course I don\u0027t count bibies.\u0027 \u0027Yer don\u0027t sy so.\u0027 \u0027Of course the other one--well, she was only a prostitute, so it didn\u0027t so much matter. It ain\u0027t like another woman is it?\u0027 \u0027Na, you\u0027re right.\u0027 \u0027Still, one don\u0027t like \u0027em ter die, even if they are thet. One mustn\u0027t be too \u0027ard on \u0027em.\u0027 \u0027Strikes me you\u0027ve got a very kind \u0027eart, Mrs. \u0027Odges,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp. \u0027I \u0027ave thet; an\u0027 I often says it \u0027ud be better for my peace of mind an\u0027 my business if I \u0027adn\u0027t. I \u0027ave ter go through a lot, I do; but I can say this for myself, I always gives satisfaction, an\u0027 thet\u0027s somethin\u0027 as all lidies in my line can\u0027t say.\u0027 They sipped their brandy for a while. \u0027It\u0027s a great trial ter me that this should \u0027ave \u0027appened,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp, coming to the subject that had been disturbing her for some time. \u0027Mine\u0027s always been a very respectable family, an\u0027 such a thing as this \u0027as never \u0027appened before. No, Mrs. \u0027Odges, I was lawfully married in church, an\u0027 I\u0027ve got my marriage lines now ter show I was, an\u0027 thet one of my daughters should \u0027ave gone wrong in this way--well, I can\u0027t understand it. I give \u0027er a good education, an\u0027 she \u0027ad all the comforts of a \u0027ome. She never wanted for nothin\u0027; I worked myself to the bone ter keep \u0027er in luxury, an\u0027 then thet she should go an\u0027 disgrace me like this!\u0027 \u0027I understand wot yer mean. Mrs. Kemp.\u0027 \u0027I can tell you my family was very respectable; an\u0027 my \u0027usband, \u0027e earned twenty-five shillings a week, an\u0027 was in the sime plice seventeen years; an\u0027 \u0027is employers sent a beautiful wreath ter put on \u0027is coffin; an\u0027 they tell me they never \u0027ad such a good workman an\u0027 sich an \u0027onest man before. An\u0027 me! Well, I can sy this--I\u0027ve done my duty by the girl, an\u0027 she\u0027s never learnt anythin\u0027 but good from me. Of course I ain\u0027t always been in wot yer might call flourishing circumstances, but I\u0027ve always set her a good example, as she could tell yer so \u0027erself if she wasn\u0027t speechless.\u0027 Mrs. Kemp paused for a moment\u0027s reflection. \u0027As they sy in the Bible,\u0027 she finished, \u0027it\u0027s enough ter mike one\u0027s grey \u0027airs go dahn into the ground in sorrer. I can show yer my marriage certificate. Of course one doesn\u0027t like ter say much, because of course she\u0027s very bad; but if she got well I should \u0027ave given \u0027er a talkin\u0027 ter.\u0027 There was another knock. \u0027Do go an\u0027 see \u0027oo thet is; I can\u0027t, on account of my rheumatics.\u0027 Mrs. Hodges opened the door. It was Jim. He was very white, and the blackness of his hair and beard, contrasting with the deathly pallor of his face, made him look ghastly. Mrs. Hodges stepped back. \u0027\u0027Oo\u0027s \u0027e?\u0027 she said, turning to Mrs. Kemp. Jim pushed her aside and went up to the bed. \u0027Doctor, is she very bad?\u0027 he asked. The doctor looked at him questioningly. Jim whispered: \u0027It was me as done it. She ain\u0027t goin\u0027 ter die, is she?\u0027 The doctor nodded. \u0027O God! wot shall I do? It was my fault! I wish I was dead!\u0027 Jim took the girl\u0027s head in his hands, and the tears burst from his eyes. \u0027She ain\u0027t dead yet, is she?\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s just living,\u0027 said the doctor. Jim bent down. \u0027Liza, Liza, speak ter me! Liza, say you forgive me! Oh, speak ter me!\u0027 His voice was full of agony. The doctor spoke. \u0027She can\u0027t hear you.\u0027 \u0027Oh, she must hear me! Liza! Liza!\u0027 He sank on his knees by the bedside. They all remained silent: Liza lying stiller than ever, her breast unmoved by the feeble respiration, Jim looking at her very mournfully; the doctor grave, with his fingers on the pulse. The two women looked at Jim. \u0027Fancy it bein\u0027 \u0027im!\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp. \u0027Strike me lucky, ain\u0027t \u0027e a sight!\u0027 \u0027You \u0027ave got \u0027er insured, Mrs. Kemp?\u0027 asked the midwife. She could bear the silence no longer. \u0027Trust me fur thet!\u0027 replied the good lady. \u0027I\u0027ve \u0027ad \u0027er insured ever since she was born. Why, only the other dy I was sayin\u0027 ter myself thet all thet money \u0027ad been wisted, but you see it wasn\u0027t; yer never know yer luck, you see!\u0027 \u0027Quite right, Mrs. Kemp; I\u0027m a rare one for insurin\u0027. It\u0027s a great thing. I\u0027ve always insured all my children.\u0027 \u0027The way I look on it is this,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp--\u0027wotever yer do when they\u0027re alive, an\u0027 we all know as children is very tryin\u0027 sometimes, you should give them a good funeral when they dies. Thet\u0027s my motto, an\u0027 I\u0027ve always acted up to it.\u0027 \u0027Do you deal with Mr. Stearman?\u0027 asked Mrs. Hodges. \u0027No, Mrs. \u0027Odges, for undertikin\u0027 give me Mr. Footley every time. In the black line \u0027e\u0027s fust an\u0027 the rest nowhere!\u0027 \u0027Well, thet\u0027s very strange now--thet\u0027s just wot I think. Mr. Footley does \u0027is work well, an\u0027 \u0027e\u0027s very reasonable. I\u0027m a very old customer of \u0027is, an\u0027 \u0027e lets me \u0027ave things as cheap as anybody.\u0027 \u0027Does \u0027e indeed! Well Mrs. \u0027Odges if it ain\u0027t askin\u0027 too much of yer, I should look upon it as very kind if you\u0027d go an\u0027 mike the arrangements for Liza.\u0027 \u0027Why, certainly, Mrs. Kemp. I\u0027m always willin\u0027 ter do a good turn to anybody, if I can.\u0027 \u0027I want it done very respectable,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp; \u0027I\u0027m not goin\u0027 ter stint for nothin\u0027 for my daughter\u0027s funeral. I like plumes, you know, although they is a bit extra.\u0027 \u0027Never you fear, Mrs. Kemp, it shall be done as well as if it was for my own \u0027usbind, an\u0027 I can\u0027t say more than thet. Mr. Footley thinks a deal of me, \u0027e does! Why, only the other dy as I was goin\u0027 inter \u0027is shop \u0027e says \"Good mornin\u0027, Mrs. \u0027Odges.\" \"Good mornin\u0027, Mr. Footley,\" says I. \"You\u0027ve jest come in the nick of time,\" says \u0027e. \"This gentleman an\u0027 myself,\" pointin\u0027 to another gentleman as was standin\u0027 there, \"we was \u0027avin\u0027 a bit of an argument. Now you\u0027re a very intelligent woman, Mrs. \u0027Odges, and a good customer too.\" \"I can say thet for myself,\" say I, \"I gives yer all the work I can.\" \"I believe you,\" says \u0027e. \"Well,\" \u0027e says, \"now which do you think? Does hoak look better than helm, or does helm look better than hoak? Hoak _versus_ helm, thet\u0027s the question.\" \"Well, Mr. Footley,\" says I, \"for my own private opinion, when you\u0027ve got a nice brass plite in the middle, an\u0027 nice brass \u0027andles each end, there\u0027s nothin\u0027 like hoak.\" \"Quite right,\" says \u0027e, \"thet\u0027s wot I think; for coffins give me hoak any day, an\u0027 I \u0027ope,\" says \u0027e, \"when the Lord sees fit ter call me to \u0027Imself, I shall be put in a hoak coffin myself.\" \"Amen,\" says I.\u0027 \u0027I like hoak,\u0027 said Mrs. Kemp. \u0027My poor \u0027usband \u0027e \u0027ad a hoak coffin. We did \u0027ave a job with \u0027im, I can tell yer. You know \u0027e \u0027ad dropsy, an\u0027 \u0027e swell up--oh, \u0027e did swell; \u0027is own mother wouldn\u0027t \u0027ave known \u0027im. Why, \u0027is leg swell up till it was as big round as \u0027is body, swop me bob, it did.\u0027 \u0027Did it indeed!\u0027 ejaculated Mrs. Hodges. \u0027Yus, an\u0027 when \u0027e died they sent the coffin up. I didn\u0027t \u0027ave Mr. Footley at thet time; we didn\u0027t live \u0027ere then, we lived in Battersea, an\u0027 all our undertikin\u0027 was done by Mr. Brownin\u0027; well, \u0027e sent the coffin up, an\u0027 we got my old man in, but we couldn\u0027t get the lid down, he was so swell up. Well, Mr. Brownin\u0027, \u0027e was a great big man, thirteen stone if \u0027e was a ounce. Well, \u0027e stood on the coffin, an\u0027 a young man \u0027e \u0027ad with \u0027im stood on it too, an\u0027 the lid simply wouldn\u0027t go dahn; so Mr. Browning\u0027, \u0027e said, \"Jump on, missus,\" so I was in my widow\u0027s weeds, yer know, but we \u0027ad ter git it dahn, so I stood on it, an\u0027 we all jumped, an\u0027 at last we got it to, an\u0027 screwed it; but, lor\u0027, we did \u0027ave a job; I shall never forget it.\u0027 Then all was silence. And a heaviness seemed to fill the air like a grey blight, cold and suffocating; and the heaviness was Death. They felt the presence in the room, and they dared not move, they dared not draw their breath. The silence was terrifying. Suddenly a sound was heard--a loud rattle. It was from the bed and rang through the room, piercing the stillness. The doctor opened one of Liza\u0027s eyes and touched it, then he laid on her breast the hand he had been holding, and drew the sheet over her head. Jim turned away with a look of intense weariness on his face, and the two women began weeping silently. The darkness was sinking before the day, and a dim, grey light came through the window. The lamp spluttered out. 半夜光景丽莎醒来，嘴里又热又干，头稍一移动就是刀劈一般的一阵剧痛。 她母亲当然也醒了，因为她和她同睡一张床，就在她身旁。她衣服也没有穿好，把被褥都裹在身上。 丽莎在这寒冷的夜里瑟瑟发抖，她是脱捧了一部分衣裳——鞋子、裙子和外套——上床的。她想从她母亲那里把毯子拉过来些，可是她一拉，肯普太太就在睡梦中号叫，把被褥裹得更紧。所以丽莎把她搁在床背上的裙子和一条披巾拖来盖在身上，想能够睡去。 但是她睡不着。她的头和手都沸烫，嘴里干得要命。她自己撑起来喝一口水的时候，头痛得倒下身子尽是哼哼地呻吟，躺在那儿心跳得厉害。一阵阵她从没有经受过的异样的疼痛侵袭着她。 然后她骨髓中发出一阵寒冷的颤抖，直透入每根血管，仿佛使血液都凝冻了。她的皮肤皱了起来，她蜷起双腿，缩成一团，紧紧裹着披巾，牙齿格格地打战。她颤抖着用微弱的声音说—— “噢，我好冷，好冷啊！妈，给我盖一点，我要冷死了。呵．我冻死了！” 但是过了一阵这寒冷似乎过去了，接下来突然一阵火热，脸上烧得通红，一身大汗，热得她把盖着的东西全都掀掉，把头颈里裹着的也都松开。 “我口渴呀，”她说。“噢，要我怎么都行，给我一点水啊！” 没有人听到她。肯普太太又睡熟了，不时发出一声鼾声。 丽莎躺在那儿，一忽儿冷得发抖，一忽儿喘不过气，耳朵边只听得身旁那均匀而粗重的呼吸。她在痛苦中呜咽。 她用力拉拉枕头，说道一一 “为什么我睡不着？为什么我不能象她那样睡着呢？” 这里黑暗得可怕l这种黑暗沉重而阴森，似乎用手可以摸得到，她十分恐惧I全凭远处的路灯透过窗口照来微弱的光芒，使她稍微心宽一些。 她觉得这黑夜将永无终止——每一分钟都象是一个小时，她不知将如何挨到天明。 又是一阵她没有经受过的异样的疼痛。 夜依然，黑暗依然，又冷又可怕I她母亲在她身旁大声而着实地打呼。 终于随着早晨的来到，睡眠也来到了。但是这睡眠几乎比醒着更糟糕．因为它带来可憎可怕的噩梦。 丽莎在梦中和她的敌人打架，布莱克斯顿太太越来越高大，而且一个化了几个，她转向哪一面都正对着她。她逃了，她奔着奔着，后来又算起一笔早上没算清的帐目来。她从前面加到后面，上面加到下面．这儿加起，那儿加起，这些数字总跟其他东西混在一起．她得从头再箅，越算越糊涂，她头脑打转，直到最后一声惊叫，醒来了。 黑暗已经让位给一个寒冷、阴黯的黎明。她那两条一点没盖什么的腿冻得冷到骨髓里，她又听到她身旁那泥醉的妈妈均匀的鼻息。 她就这样躺了好一段时间，觉得身体很不舒服，很难过，不过比夜里好些。 她母亲终于醒了。 “丽莎！”她叫道。 “唉，妈妈，”她没力气地回答。 “弄杯茶给我，好吗？” “我不能动，妈，我病着。” “噢！”肯普太太惊异地说。再朝她看看，“唷，你怎么啦？怎么，你面孔通红，额角上——烫得厉害！你怎么啦，我的女儿？” “我不知道，”丽莎说。“我整夜难过得不得了，总当要死了。” “我懂了，”肯普太太摇摇头说，“问题是你没喝惯酒，所以喝了一点自然吃不消了。瞧我，我这生龙活虎的样子。相信我的话，忌酒没有好处，这回就叫你看颜色啦，叫你看颜色。” 肯普太太把这看作是上帝的惩罚。 她站起身来，配了些冲水的威士忌。 “喏，喝这个，”她说，“碰到夜里喝得太多了一点的时候，最好是第二天早上再喝一点醒醒酒。这有魔术般的效力。” “拿开，”丽莎说，厌恶地掉转头；“我闻到这气味就难过。我永世也不再碰烈酒。” “啊，我们一生中有时候都这么说，不过我们喝还是喝．而且非喝不可。啊呀，我这艰难辛苦的一生——”这里无需去重复肯普太太重复的话。 丽莎整天没有起床。 汤姆来看望她，知道她病得厉害。丽莎哀伤地问，有没有别人来看过她，她母亲对她说“没有”，她听了微微叹息。但是她感觉很难过，对任何事情都不想多费心思。 到渐近夜晚的时候，寒热又上升了，她的头痛也更加厉害。她母亲上床来，很快就睡着了，由丽莎一个人去忍受苦难。 直到清晨六点钟左右，她终究再也忍受不住了，一阵分娩的阵痛使她尖声急叫起来，惊醒了她母亲。 肯普太太吓得不知所措。她赶上楼去，叫醒了住在她们楼上的那个女人。这位善良的老太太毫不犹豫，穿上一条裙子，就下楼来了。 “她小产了，”她看了看丽莎说。“你能叫个人到医院去请医生吗？” “不，这个时候我找谁去呢？”． “好吧，我叫我老头儿去跑一趟。” 她叫了她丈夫，差他去了。她是个结实的中年妇女，浓眉大眼，臂膀粗粗的。她叫霍奇斯太太。 “幸亏你来找了我．”她坐定下来后说。“我在外面当看护，所以这些我都懂。” “不过，你使我大吃一惊，”肯普太太说，“我一点不知道她有身子了。她从没有对我讲起过。” “你可知道是谁跟她有了的？” “你问的问题我一无所知，’’肯普太太答道。“不过，我现在想想，一定是汤姆。他常和丽莎在一起。他是单身汉，所以他们可以结婚——倒还好。” “不是汤姆，’’丽莎微弱的声音说。 “不是他，那么是谁呢？” 丽莎不答话。 “嗯？”她妈重复问，“是谁呢？” 丽莎一动不动躺在那儿，不吭一声。 “别管它，肯普太太，”霍奇斯太太说，“现在不要去烦扰她。等她好一点，你什么都会弄明白的。” 这两个女人默默地坐着，等待医生到来。丽莎气喘吁吁地躺着，两只眼睛空望着墙上。有时候吉姆在她心头闪过，她张开嘴巴想要叫唤他，但在绝望之中又没有叫出声来。 医生来了。 “你看她情况严重吗，医生？”霍奇斯太太问。 “恐怕很严重，”他回答。“我晚上再来。” “啊，医生，”他要走的时候，肯普太太对他说，“你能给我些治风湿的药吗？我的风湿要我的命，现在冷天，我简直不知怎么过。另外，医生，你能给我些牛肉汁吗？我丈夫死了，我女儿病成这样子，我当然没法出去干活，所以我们实在短缺——” 白天过去了，晚上，霍奇斯太太忙了一天自己的家务，又下楼来了。肯普太太在床上睡着。 “我正在稍微打个瞌睡，”她醒来对霍奇斯太太说。 “你女儿怎么样？”那个太太问。 “哦，”肯普太太回答，“我的风湿发得那么厉害，我痛得简直毫无办法，而现在丽莎又不能替我擦药，那就更糟。真不巧，正在我需要照顾自己的时候，她生病了。不过，这也是我自己运气不好！” 霍奇斯太太走到丽莎跟前看看她。她就象早上离开她时候一样地躺着，两颊通红，嘴巴张着喘气，额头上尽是一颗颗小小的汗珠。 “你怎么样，宝贝？”霍奇斯太太问，但是丽莎没有回答。 “我看她没有知觉了，”肯普太太说。“我再三问她是谁跟她搞了的，可她似乎听不见我说的话。这件事对我的震动可大呀，霍奇斯太太。” “我相信你．”那个太太同情地说。 “唉，当你来对我说这是怎么回事的时候，你只要拿根羽毛准能把我拨倒。我原来对这事情象死人一样，一无所知。’’ “我一看就知道是这么回事了，”霍奇斯太太点点头说。 “是呀，你当然懂得。我想你在这方面有丰富的工作经验。” “你说得对，肯普太太，你说得对。我做这工作，到现在快有二十年了，不懂也该懂了。” “你觉得这行当收入不错吧？” “嗯，肯普太太，总的说来，我觉得还可以。我一般是收费五先令．我该说，我做的工作，要这一点不算太多。” 丽莎害病的消息很快传布开去了，于是一天里面邻人来看望她的不止一个、两个。 此刻有人敲门，霍奇斯太太去开了门。 汤姆站在门口，要求进来。 “好，你进来，”肯普太太说。 他蹑手蹑脚地走过来，默默站在那儿望着丽莎。霍奇斯太太在他旁边。 “我可以对她说话吗？”他轻声说。 “她听不见你。” 他叹息了一声。 “你看她会好吗？”他问。 霍奇斯太太耸耸肩膀。 “我不敢说．”她谨慎地说。 汤姆俯下身子，涨红了脸，吻了她一下,然后没再说一句话，就离开了这屋子。 “那就是追求她的那个小伙子，”肯普太太说，用大拇指指着背后离去的汤姆。 不多一刻，医生来了。 “你看她怎么样，医生？”霍奇斯太太以催生婆和看护的身份神气十足地匆忙上前，问他。 “恐怕情况很不好。” “你看她会死吗？”她压低声音在他耳朵边问。 “靠不住！” 医生在丽莎旁边坐下的时候，霍奇斯太太转身对肯普太太有所暗示地点点头，肯普太太用手帕擦眼睛。 然后霍奇斯太太走出屋子，来到在门口等待着的一些人跟前。 “医生怎么说？”他们问，其中有汤姆。 “他说的就是我早就说的，我早知道她活不成了。” 汤姆突然放声大叫，“啊，丽莎！” 霍奇斯太太回进屋里，有个女人评论说—— “我认为霍奇斯太太实在聪明。” “是啊，”另一个女人评论说，“上一回她给我催生，简直高明极了。如果要我作选择的话，我宁可要霍奇斯太太，而不要四十个医生。” “老实说，我也宁可要她。我从来没有听到她出过毛病。” 霍奇斯太太在肯普太太旁边坐下，开始安慰她。 “你为什么不喝一点白兰地镇定镇定神经呢，肯普太太？”她说：“你需要喝一点。” “我真有点要昏过去了，不禁想喝两便士威士忌提提神。” “不，肯普太太，”霍奇斯太太把手按在这个太太的臂膀上，认真地说。“你听我的话——你觉得不舒服的时候，白兰地最能使你振作起来。我自己并不反对威士忌，不过当药吃的话，却远不如白兰地。” “我不会以为自己比你在行，霍奇斯太太；你认为怎样对，我都照着做。’’ 碰巧家里有点白兰地，肯普太太就倒出来给她自己和她的朋友喝。 “我出外工作的时候，是习惯不喝酒的，”她表示抱歉，“不过，为了陪陪你，喝一口也可以。” “祝你健康，霍奇斯太太。‘‘ “你也健康，谢谢你，肯普太太。” 丽莎一动不动地躺着，呼吸很微弱，眼睛闭着。医生一直把指头按在她脉搏上。 “我最近运气非常不好，’’霍奇斯太太舔舔嘴唇说，“这是我这十天里碰到的第二个要死的人——我是指女人；当然婴孩不算在内。” “是吗？” “还有一个死掉的——不过，那是个妓女，所以无所谓。这同其他女人不一样，是不是？” “不一样，你说得对。’’ “然而我们总不希望她们死掉，即使是妓女。我们决不能对她们太冷酷。” “我发现你良心真好，霍奇斯太太，’’肯普太太说。 “我的心是好；我常说，我要是没有这颗良心，还好心安理得地多做点生意哩。我什么都得承担，的确，但是我可以自己夸口说一句，我总干得叫人满意，这可不是干我们这一行的人都能说得的。” 她们喝了一会白兰地。 “这种事情会发生，真是对我沉重的折磨，”肯普太太说，话头讲到了她困恼已久的问题上。 “我们家一向很体面的，从没有出过这种事。不，霍奇斯太太，我是在教堂里合法地结婚的，我现在还拿得出结婚证书来给你看，而在我的女儿中间会有一个出这样的毛病——唉，我没法理解。我给她受过好好的教育，她又有一切家庭的安乐。她什么也不缺少。我做死做活给她吃得好，穿得好，而她竟做出这样丢人的事来！” “我懂得你的意思，肯普太太。” “我可以告诉你，我的家庭是很体面的；我丈夫，他一星期挣二十五先令，而且在同一个地方做了十七年；他的老板还在他棺材上安上了一个漂亮的花圈；他们对我说，他们从来不曾有过象他这样好的工人、这样老实的人。 “而我呢！唉，我可以这样说——我对这个姑娘是尽到了我的责任，我从没有教坏她什么。当然我的境况并不一直是你们所说的那样兴旺，可是我始终给她做出好榜样。要不是她现在不会开口，你可以自己问她。” 肯普太太停顿下来，思考了一会儿。 “《圣经》上说的，”她末了说，“带着灰白的头发含悲埋在地下是足够的了。注 我现在还可以拿出结婚证书给你看。当然她病很重，我不能多说什么，然而如果她好了的话．我要好好训她一顿。” 又有人敲门。 “去看看是谁I我不能动，由于我的风湿。” 霍奇斯太太去开了门。来的是吉姆。 他脸色惨白异常，他的漆黑的头发和胡子和他死人般苍白的脸，相映之下显得阴森可怕。霍奇斯太太后退了一步。 “他是谁？”她转身问肯普太太。 吉姆把她推开，直走到床前。 “医生，她很不好吗？”他问。 医生疑惑地朝他看看。 吉姆低声说，“是我跟她有了的。她不会死吧，会不会死?\" 医生点点头。 “啊，上帝！教我怎么办？这是我的罪过！我但愿一死！’’ 吉姆双手捧住姑娘的头，眼泪直淌下来。 “她还没有死吧？” “她还有口气，”医生说。 吉姆俯下身子。 “丽莎，丽莎．对我说话呀！丽莎，你饶恕我！哦，对我说话呀！” 他的声音十分凄惨。 医生说—— “她听不见你。” “哦．她一定得听见我！丽莎！丽莎！” 他在她床前跪倒了下来。 他们全都默不作声：丽莎更沉静地躺着，呼吸微弱得胸口也不动，吉姆悲痛万分地端详着她；医生沉重地把手指按在她脉搏上。那两个女人望着吉姆。 “想不到是他！”肯普太太说。“我觉得也是运气，他多英俊！” “你给她保了险吗，肯普太太？’’那催生婆问。她再也受不了这沉默了。 “这还用问我！”这位好太太说。“她一生下来，我就给她保好险了。是啊，前几天我还在想，这种钱都是白费的，可你瞧，并不白费；一个人的命运自己也不知道！” “对呀，肯普太太；我特别相信保险。保险是大好事。我给我所有的孩子都保上险。” “我是这样想的，”肯普太太说，“不管他们活着的时候你怎样对待他们——我们都知道，孩子有时候是非常讨厌的——但是他们死了，丧葬必须给他们好好办。这是我的格言，我一直都遵守的。” “你交托给史蒂曼先生办的吗？”霍奇斯太太问。 “不，霍奇斯太太，丧葬的事我每次都找福特利先生。在这个行业中，他是首屈一指，别人都望尘莫及的！” “咦，这可真奇怪——你的想法和我正好完全一样。福特利先生生活做得好，收费又公道。我真正是他的老主顾了，他总给我最便宜的价钱。” “真的吗！那末，霍奇斯太太，如果他对你不会敲竹杠的话，我想麻烦你，请你去跟他安排一下丽莎的事。’’ “好哇，没问题，肯普太太。只要我能够，我总是乐于帮人做好事的。” “我要把这事情办得很体面，’’肯普太太说。“我为女儿办丧葬，决不吝啬，你知道，我要排场，虽然那是有点多余的。” “不用担心，肯普太太，我一定使它办得象给我自己丈夫办丧葬一样，我话都说完了。 “福特利先生很看得起我，的确！就在几天前，我到他店里去，他说，．霍奇斯太太，早上好。’我说，‘福特利先生，早上好。’ “．你来得正好”他说。‘这位先生和我，’他指着站在旁边的另一位先生，．我们正在争论一个问题。喏，你是个有见识的女人，霍奇斯太太，而且又是我的老主顾。’ “-这倒可以自己称得”我说，‘我有生意总是尽量拉来给你做的。’ “．我相信你是的”他说。‘喂，’他说，‘现在请你说说看： “．棺材的材料是栎木比榆木好呢，还是榆木比栎木好？栎木还是榆木，就是这么个问题。’ “‘哦，福特利先生，’我说，‘我个人的意见，如果你在棺材面上中央用黄铜镶嵌，两头各装黄铜把儿，那就没有比栎木更好的了。’ “‘对啊，’他说，‘这就是我的想法。讲到棺材，最好永远给我栎木的，而且我希望，’他说，‘到上帝想到要召我回到他身边的时候，我自己将被放进一口栎木的棺材。， “‘阿门，’我说。” “我喜欢栎木，”肯普太太说。“我那可怜的丈夫，他用的就是栎木棺材。我们放他进去可费劲哪，我可以告诉你，你知道，他有水肿病，周身浮肿——啊，肿得不得了，肿得他亲娘也认不得他。 呃，他的腿肿得同他身体一样粗，一点不假。” “当真！”霍奇斯太太叫起来。 “是的，他一死，棺材送来了。当时我还没有跟福特利先生有往来关系。那个时候我们不住在这里，我们住在巴特西，所有丧葬的事情都由布朗宁先生办。就这样，布朗宁先生把棺材送来了，我们把我的老头儿放了进去，可是我们盖不上盖子，他肿得太厉害了。 “正好布朗宁先生又高又大，足足有一百八九十磅。他站到了棺材盖上，他带来的一个小伙子也站了上去，但盖子就是盖不下去。于是布朗宁先生说—— “‘跳上来，太太，’他说；我穿着寡妇的丧服，你知道，可是我们总得把盖子盖上，所以我也站了上去，我们大家一起跳，这才终于盖好，旋上螺钉。不过，天哪，我们可费劲哪；我永远忘不了。” 接着，一片寂静。空气沉重得仿佛充塞着灰色的瘟疫，阴冷而令人窒息；这沉重的就是死亡。他们感觉到它来到了这屋子里，他们不敢动，他们不敢透气。寂静使人毛骨悚然。 突然响起一个声音——一阵大声的哮吼。它从床上发出来，震动整个房间，打破了沉寂。 医生揭开丽莎的一只眼睛，碰碰它，然后把他一直握着的她那只手按在她胸口上，拉起床单，遮没了她的头。 吉姆脸上带着极度疲惫的神色转身离去。两个女人开始悄悄地呜咽起来。 黑暗在黎明前渐渐消散，一道熹微的灰白光芒从窗口投射进来。灯火毕毕剥剥爆响着熄灭了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/318/159.html","bookId":160,"book":{"id":160,"title":"兰贝斯的丽莎 Liza of Lambeth","description":"简介： Liza of
