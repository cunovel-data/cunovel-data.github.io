{"id":4566,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Bank Holiday was a beautiful day: the cloudless sky threatened a stifling heat for noontide, but early in the morning, when Liza got out of bed and threw open the window, it was fresh and cool. She dressed herself, wondering how she should spend her day; she thought of Sally going off to Chingford with her lover, and of herself remaining alone in the dull street with half the people away. She almost wished it were an ordinary work-day, and that there were no such things as bank holidays. And it seemed to be a little like two Sundays running, but with the second rather worse than the first. Her mother was still sleeping, and she was in no great hurry about getting the breakfast, but stood quietly looking out of the window at the house opposite.\n In a little while she saw Sally coming along. She was arrayed in purple and fine linen--a very smart red dress, trimmed with velveteen, and a tremendous hat covered with feathers. She had reaped the benefit of keeping her hair in curl-papers since Saturday, and her sandy fringe stretched from ear to ear. She was in enormous spirits.\n \u0027\u0027Ulloa, Liza!\u0027 she called as soon as she saw her at the window.\n Liza looked at her a little enviously.\n \u0027\u0027Ulloa!\u0027 she answered quietly.\n \u0027I\u0027m just goin\u0027 to the \"Red Lion\" to meet \u0027Arry.\u0027\n \u0027At what time d\u0027yer start?\u0027\n \u0027The brake leaves at \u0027alf-past eight sharp.\u0027\n \u0027Why, it\u0027s only eight; it\u0027s only just struck at the church. \u0027Arry won\u0027t be there yet, will he?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, \u0027e\u0027s sure ter be early. I couldn\u0027t wite. I\u0027ve been witin\u0027 abaht since \u0027alf-past six. I\u0027ve been up since five this morning.\u0027\n \u0027Since five! What \u0027ave you been doin\u0027?\u0027\n \u0027Dressin\u0027 myself and doin\u0027 my \u0027air. I woke up so early. I\u0027ve been dreamin\u0027 all the night abaht it. I simply couldn\u0027t sleep.\u0027\n \u0027Well, you are a caution!\u0027 said Liza.\n \u0027Bust it, I don\u0027t go on the spree every day! Oh, I do \u0027ope I shall enjoy myself.\u0027\n \u0027Why, you simply dunno where you are!\u0027 said Liza, a little crossly.\n \u0027Don\u0027t you wish you was comin\u0027, Liza?\u0027 asked Sally.\n \u0027Na! I could if I liked, but I don\u0027t want ter.\u0027\n \u0027You are a coughdrop--thet\u0027s all I can say. Ketch me refusin\u0027 when I \u0027ave the chanst.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s done now. I ain\u0027t got the chanst any more.\u0027 Liza said this with just a little regret in her voice.\n \u0027Come on dahn to the \"Red Lion\", Liza, and see us off,\u0027 said Sally.\n \u0027No, I\u0027m damned if I do!\u0027 answered Liza, with some warmth.\n \u0027You might as well. P\u0027raps \u0027Arry won\u0027t be there, an\u0027 you can keep me company till \u0027e comes. An\u0027 you can see the \u0027orses.\u0027\n Liza was really very anxious to see the brake and the horses and the people going; but she hesitated a little longer. Sally asked her once again. Then she said:\n \u0027Arright; I\u0027ll come with yer, and wite till the bloomin\u0027 old thing starts.\u0027\n She did not trouble to put on a hat, but just walked out as she was, and accompanied Sally to the public-house which was getting up the expedition.\n Although there was still nearly half an hour to wait, the brake was drawn up before the main entrance; it was large and long, with seats arranged crosswise, so that four people could sit on each; and it was drawn by two powerful horses, whose harness the coachman was now examining. Sally was not the first on the scene, for already half a dozen people had taken their places, but Harry had not yet arrived. The two girls stood by the public-door, looking at the preparations. Huge baskets full of food were brought out and stowed away; cases of beer were hoisted up and put in every possible place--under the seats, under the driver\u0027s legs, and even beneath the brake. As more people came up, Sally began to get excited about Harry\u0027s non-appearance.\n \u0027I say, I wish \u0027e\u0027d come!\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027E is lite.\u0027\n Then she looked up and down the Westminster Bridge Road to see if he was in view.\n \u0027Suppose \u0027e don\u0027t turn up! I will give it \u0027im when \u0027e comes for keepin\u0027 me witin\u0027 like this.\u0027\n \u0027Why, there\u0027s a quarter of an hour yet,\u0027 said Liza, who saw nothing at all to get excited about.\n At last Sally saw her lover, and rushed off to meet him. Liza was left alone, rather disconsolate at all this bustle and preparation. She was not sorry that she had refused Tom\u0027s invitation, but she did wish that she had conscientiously been able to accept it. Sally and her friend came up; attired in his Sunday best, he was a fit match for his lady-love--he wore a shirt and collar, unusual luxuries--and be carried under his arm a concertina to make things merry on the way.\n \u0027Ain\u0027t you goin\u0027, Liza?\u0027 he asked in surprise at seeing her without a hat and with her apron on.\n \u0027Na,\u0027 said Sally, \u0027ain\u0027t she a soft? Tom said \u0027e\u0027d tike \u0027er, an\u0027 she wouldn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m dashed!\u0027\n Then they climbed the ladder and took their seats, so that Liza was left alone again. More people had come along, and the brake was nearly full. Liza knew them all, but they were too busy taking their places to talk to her. At last Tom came. He saw her standing there and went up to her.\n \u0027Won\u0027t yer change yer mind, Liza, an\u0027 come along with us?\u0027\n \u0027Na, Tom, I told yer I wouldn\u0027t--it\u0027s not right like.\u0027 She felt she must repeat that to herself often.\n \u0027I shan\u0027t enjoy it a bit without you,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Well, I can\u0027t \u0027elp it!\u0027 she answered, somewhat sullenly.\n At that moment a man came out of the public-house with a horn in his hand; her heart gave a great jump, for if there was anything she adored it was to drive along to the tootling of a horn. She really felt it was very hard lines that she must stay at home when all these people were going to have such a fine time; and they were all so merry, and she could picture to herself so well the delights of the drive and the picnic. She felt very much inclined to cry. But she mustn\u0027t go, and she wouldn\u0027t go: she repeated that to herself twice as the trumpeter gave a preliminary tootle.\n Two more people hurried along, and when they came near Liza saw that they were Jim Blakeston and a woman whom she supposed to be his wife.\n \u0027Are you comin\u0027, Liza?\u0027 Jim said to her.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she answered. \u0027I didn\u0027t know you was goin\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027I wish you was comin\u0027,\u0027 he replied, \u0027we shall \u0027ave a game.\u0027\n She could only just keep back the sobs; she so wished she were going. It did seem hard that she must remain behind; and all because she wasn\u0027t going to marry Tom. After all, she didn\u0027t see why that should prevent her; there really was no need to refuse for that. She began to think she had acted foolishly: it didn\u0027t do anyone any good that she refused to go out with Tom, and no one thought it anything specially fine that she should renounce her pleasure. Sally merely thought her a fool.\n Tom was standing by her side, silent, and looking disappointed and rather unhappy. Jim said to her, in a low voice:\n \u0027I am sorry you\u0027re not comin\u0027!\u0027\n It was too much. She did want to go so badly, and she really couldn\u0027t resist any longer. If Tom would only ask her once more, and if she could only change her mind reasonably and decently, she would accept; but he stood silent, and she had to speak herself. It was very undignified.\n \u0027Yer know, Tom.\u0027 she said, \u0027I don\u0027t want ter spoil your day.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I don\u0027t think I shall go alone; it \u0027ud be so precious slow.\u0027\n Supposing he didn\u0027t ask her again! What should she do? She looked up at the clock on the front of the pub, and noticed that it only wanted five minutes to the half-hour. How terrible it would be if the brake started and he didn\u0027t ask her! Her heart beat violently against her chest, and in her agitation she fumbled with the corner of her apron.\n \u0027Well, what can I do, Tom dear?\u0027\n \u0027Why, come with me, of course. Oh. Liza, do say yes.\u0027\n She had got the offer again, and it only wanted a little seemly hesitation, and the thing was done.\n \u0027I should like ter, Tom,\u0027 she said. \u0027But d\u0027you think it \u0027ud be arright?\u0027\n \u0027Yus, of course it would. Come on, Liza!\u0027 In his eagerness he clasped her hand.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she remarked, looking down, \u0027if it\u0027d spoil your \u0027oliday--.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t go if you don\u0027t--swop me bob, I won\u0027t!\u0027 he answered.\n \u0027Well, if I come, it won\u0027t mean that I\u0027m keepin\u0027 company with you.\u0027\n \u0027Na, it won\u0027t mean anythin\u0027 you don\u0027t like.\u0027\n \u0027Arright!\u0027 she said.\n \u0027You\u0027ll come?\u0027 he could hardly believe her.\n \u0027Yus!\u0027 she answered, smiling all over her face.\n \u0027You\u0027re a good sort, Liza! I say, \u0027Arry, Liza\u0027s comin\u0027!\u0027 he shouted.\n \u0027Liza? \u0027Oorray!\u0027 shouted Harry.\n \u0027\u0027S\u0027at right, Liza?\u0027 called Sally.\n And Liza feeling quite joyful and light of heart called back:\n \u0027Yus!\u0027\n \u0027\u0027Oorray!\u0027 shouted Sally in answer.\n \u0027Thet\u0027s right, Liza,\u0027 called Jim; and he smiled pleasantly as she looked at him.\n \u0027There\u0027s just room for you two \u0027ere,\u0027 said Harry, pointing to the vacant places by his side.\n \u0027Arright!\u0027 said Tom.\n \u0027I must jest go an\u0027 get a \u0027at an\u0027 tell mother,\u0027 said Liza.\n \u0027There\u0027s just three minutes. Be quick!\u0027 answered Tom, and as she scampered off as hard as she could go, he shouted to the coachman: \u0027\u0027Old \u0027ard; there\u0027 another passenger comin\u0027 in a minute.\u0027\n \u0027Arright, old cock,\u0027 answered the coachman: \u0027no \u0027urry!\u0027\n Liza rushed into the room, and called to her mother, who was still asleep:\n \u0027Mother! mother! I\u0027m going to Chingford!\u0027\n Then tearing off her old dress she slipped into her gorgeous violet one; she kicked off her old ragged shoes and put on her new boots. She brushed her hair down and rapidly gave her fringe a twirl and a twist--it was luckily still moderately in curl from the previous Saturday--and putting on her black hat with all the feathers, she rushed along the street, and scrambling up the brake steps fell panting on Tom\u0027s lap.\n The coachman cracked his whip, the trumpeter tootled his horn, and with a cry and a cheer from the occupants, the brake clattered down the road.\n 那天公假日天气晴朗，万里无云，恐怕中午将热得要命，但是清早丽莎起床，打开窗子的时候，非常凉爽。她穿好衣服，不知她这一天将怎么过。她想萨莉将跟她情人一起去庆福，而她自己将孤零零留在这条一半人都跑掉了的死气沉沉的小街上。她几乎宁愿今天照常是工作日，而没有什么公假日不公假日。现在有点象是连着过两个星期天，可这第二天不象第一天好过。\n 她的母亲还睡着，她不用赶忙准备早饭，只是默默地望着窗外对面的房屋。\n 一会儿她看见萨莉到街上来了。她穿着紫颜色的麻纱衬衫，一件棉绒镶边的漂亮红色上衣，头上戴着一顶插满羽毛的阔边大帽子。她从星期六以来一直把头发卷在卷发纸里，大有好处，鬈曲的灰黄色前刘海遮着整个脑门子。她兴致勃勃。\n “嗨！丽莎！’’她一看见她在窗口上就叫喊。\n 丽莎妒羡地瞧着她。\n “嗳！”她轻声地应她。\n “我正要到红狮酒店去碰头哈利。”\n “你们什么时候出发？”\n “马车整八点半上路。”\n “现在还只八点呢；教堂刚敲钟。哈利还不会到那里吧？”\n “哦，他肯定早到。我等不及，我从六点半就在这附近等着啦。我今天早晨五点钟就起来了。”\n “五点钟就起来！你一直在做些什么？”\n “打扮打扮，做做头发。我老早就醒了，我整夜尽是做着去玩儿的梦，我简直没法睡。”\n “嗯，你真奇怪。”\n “有什么奇怪的，我又不是每天有得出去痛痛快快地玩儿的！噢，我真希望今天快活一场。”\n “嗳，你简直头脑发昏了，”丽莎有些不乐意地说。\n “你不想去吗，丽莎？”萨莉问。\n “不去！我要去可以去，可是我不要去。”\n “你是个怪人——我只能这样说。我有机会去，才决不放过呢。”\n “现在没办法了。机会已经失掉了。”丽莎说这话的时候，口气里略有遗憾的意思。\n “到红狮酒店去，丽莎，送送我们，”萨莉说。\n “不，我才不去呢！’’丽莎有些激动地说。\n “去吧。也许哈利还没来，你可以陪我一会儿，等到他来嘛。\n 你还可以看看那些马。”\n 丽莎实在很想去看看那辆四轮大马车和那些马，还有那些出游的人，然而她又迟疑了一会儿。萨莉重又叫她。于是她说一\n “好吧，我跟你去，等着看那缺德的车子开掉。”\n 她帽子也不高兴戴，就这样往外走，陪着萨莉到安排这次旅游的小酒店去。\n 虽然还要等待将近半个小时，但是那辆四轮大马车已经停好在酒店大门口；车身又大又长，一排排座位是横排的，可以坐四个人。车子是由两匹高头大马拖的，马车夫正在检查马具可都套好。\n 萨莉并不是第一个到场的人，原来已经有六七个人坐好位子了，而哈利却还没有到。\n 两个姑娘站在酒店门口，看他们在做着各种准备。一只只装满了食物的大篮子正在搬出来装上车子，一箱箱啤酒掮得高高的，尽往能塞的空档里塞——座位底下，马车夫的大腿底下，甚至车肚底下。\n 人越来越多，哈利还没到，萨莉焦急起来。\n “他早该来了！”她说。“他迟到了。”\n 于是她向威斯敏斯特桥大道两头张望，看能不能望见他。\n “他不来了吗！他叫我等了这么长时间，他来了，我可要好好教训他。”\n “怎么，还有一刻钟哩，”丽莎说，认为根本不用焦急。\n 终于萨莉看到她的情人了，她冲着迎上前去。丽莎被丢下剩一个人，在这喧闹和纷乱中倍感愁闷。她并不是懊悔拒绝了汤姆的邀请，而她是想假如她能够心安理得地接受他的邀请该多好啊！\n 萨莉和她的男朋友走到她跟前。他穿着他最漂亮的节日服装，他和他的心上人真是天生一对——他穿着装领衬衫，好不寻常——他在夹肢窝里抱着一只手风琴，准备在一路上热闹热闹的。\n “你不去吗，丽莎？”他看见她头上没戴帽子，身上穿着围裙，诧异地问她。\n “她不去，”萨莉说，“哪有这样的傻子？汤姆说带她去，她不要。”\n “是呀！我就是不去！”\n 接着他们爬上马车的踏板，坐好位子。原来已经又有好多人来了，一辆四轮大马车几乎挤满了。这些人丽莎全认识，可是他们都忙于找位子，没空跟她说话。\n 最后，汤姆来了。他看见丽莎站在那里，走到她跟前。\n “丽莎，你不改变主意，同我们一起去吗？”\n “不，汤姆，我对你说了，我不去——那样不大好。”她觉得她应该常对自己重复这句话。\n “你不一起去，我一点没味儿，”他说。\n “可是我没有办法！”她回答，多少有点抑郁地。\n 正在这时候，小酒店里走出一个人来，手拿喇叭。她的心怦的一跳，因为她最喜欢的就是乘着马车在嘟嘟的喇叭声中行进。\n 她看到这些人都将那么快活地出去玩儿，而她得呆在家里，心里实在非常难过。他们都是那么兴高采烈的，她可以想象这次马车旅行和野餐的欢乐景象。她真要哭出来。\n 但是她一定不能去，她不好去：喇叭吹起预备号的时候，她重又把这话对自己重复了两遍。\n 又有两个人在急匆匆地赶来。到他们走近来的时候，丽莎看到他们是吉姆·布莱克斯顿和一个女人，她猜想大概是他的老婆。\n “你也去吗，丽莎？”吉姆问她。\n “不，”她回答。“我不知道你也去。”\n “我希望你一起去．”他说；“我们还有比赛游戏呢？”\n 她只能强自抑制在喉咙口的呜咽；她是多么热切地但愿能去呵。\n 她非得留下，这确实似乎太使她伤心，而这就只因为她不准备嫁给汤姆。她想想毕竟这没有理由阻止她去；没有必要因此而拒绝他的邀请。她开始觉得自己做了蠢事：她坚决不跟汤姆一起去，这对任何人没有任何好处；她硬是屏弃她应有的欢乐，这又没有人会认为是什么特别的美德。萨莉只认为她是傻瓜而已。\n 汤姆站在旁边，缄默着，一副失望和很沮丧的样子。吉姆低声对她说——\n “你不去，我真遗憾！”\n 这话对她反应太大了。她本来就是那么想要去，这回她实在无法抵制这诱惑了。只要汤姆再请她一次，只要她能合于情理而体面地改变一下主意，她就接受了；可是他站着一声不响。她只好自己开口。这确实有失尊严。\n “你知道，汤姆，”她说，“我不愿意煞你节日的风景。’’\n “唉，我不想一个人去，去了也没趣。”\n 假如这会儿他再请一请她呢！她会怎么样？\n 她抬头看看小酒店前面的钟，八点半还差五分。要是车子开了，而他还不请她，那该多糟糕！她的心在胸口猛烈地跳跃．她紧张得尽扭弄她的围裙角。\n “那么，我该怎么办呢，亲爱的汤姆？’’\n “那么，当然跟我一起去啰。哦，丽莎，说声‘好’吧。”\n 她终于得到了再次的邀请，这一下只需要稍微表示一点好象犹豫的样子，事情就解决了。\n “我愿意去，汤姆．”她说，“不过，你看这会有什么不好吗？”\n “当然不会有什么不好。一起去吧，丽莎！’’他心情激动，一把握住了她的手。“好，”她说，沉下了头，“要是那会煞了你节日的风景——”“你不去的话，我也不去——杀我头也不去！”他回答说。“不过，如果我去，并不表示我跟你作伴。”“不，这不会表示任何你所不喜欢的什么。”“好！”她说。“那你去了吧？’’他不大相信她的应允。“去！”她满面笑容地回答。“你真是个好姑娘，丽莎！喂，哈利，丽莎也去了！”他喊道。“丽莎？好——！”哈利叫起来。“是真的吗，丽莎？”萨莉大声问。丽莎感到非常欢欣愉快，也叫了起来——“是啊！”“好哇！”萨莉嚷着应答。“那才对了，丽莎，”吉姆说；他瞧着她，笑吟吟地。“这儿正好你们两个坐，”哈利指着他旁边的空档。“好！”汤姆说。“我还得去拿顶帽子，再告诉声妈妈，’’丽莎说。“只有三分钟啦。快啊！’’汤姆回答，一面在丽莎拼命奔去的时候，他大声对马车夫说，“老朋友，还有一个乘客，_会儿就来。”\n “好，小伙子，”马车夫说；“不用急！”\n 丽莎冲进屋子，对她还睡着的母亲说——\n “妈妈！妈妈！我到庆福去！”\n 她随即把身上的旧衣服拉掉，倏地穿上她那件漂亮的紫罗兰颜色的新衣裳；她踢掉破烂的旧鞋子，穿上了她的新皮鞋。她把头发往下撂了撂，把前刘海匆匆拨弄一下——幸亏前天星期六卷好的还成样子——戴上她那插满羽毛的黑帽子，直往街上奔，跌跌撞撞爬上马车的踏板，喘着气倒在汤姆身上。\n 马车夫挥响皮鞭子，喇叭手嘟嘟地吹起喇叭，在车上的一片叫嚷和欢呼声中，这辆四轮大马车喀啦喀啦地顺着大道驶去了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/318/151.html","bookId":160,"book":{"id":160,"title":"兰贝斯的丽莎 Liza of Lambeth","description":"简介： Liza of Lambeth (1897) was W.
