{"id":32401,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. A SEA FIGHT","content":"As soon as they had reached a distance of two or three hundred yards from the shore Godfrey ceased paddling. \"Now we can talk matters over, Luka. There is no occasion for hurry now. If these fellows in the canoes are disposed[323] to fight we can\u0027t prevent them. They will certainly be out of the river before we could get back there; and even if we did pass first they could easily overtake us, for those light craft of theirs would go two feet to our one unless we had wind for our sail. So we may as well take things easy, and decidedly the first thing to do is to wash and dress Jack\u0027s wound, and then to get some tea and something to eat. We have had nothing since we were caught yesterday between twelve and one o\u0027clock. \"What a lucky thing it was we hid the canoe, Luka!\" he went on, as the Tartar pulled the boat up alongside the canoe and began to prepare to light a fire. \"The chances are we should not have been able to get her off as well as the boat, and even if we had they would have taken out all our stores. The meat we might replace, but the loss of the tea and tobacco, and above all of the matches, would have been terrible; besides, they would have got our spare hatchets and knives, the fish-hooks and lines, and all our furs. We don\u0027t want the furs for warmth now, but it would make a deal of difference to our comfort if we had to sleep on hard boards. I do not know how to feel thankful enough that we hid the canoe away.\" \"We could not have gone without our things,\" Luka said. \"We would have fought them all and killed them rather than lose our tea and tobacco.\" Godfrey laughed at his companion\u0027s earnestness. \"I think that would have been paying too dearly for them, Luka. Still we should have missed them badly.\" Just as they had finished their meal they saw some black spots ahead of them close inshore. \"I should not be surprised if they have been picking up those fellows who followed us, Luka. No doubt the man who ran back would tell them they could do nothing against our arms. But I don\u0027t think they will dare attack us in our boat even if[324] they have got all the men there. There were only twelve at first, not counting the old men who were in their camp when we were brought there. You shot one of them, so there are only eleven, even if they have got on board those who followed us. I have always heard that they are plucky little fellows, but I do not think they would be fools enough to attack us on the water. I feel sure they can\u0027t have any intention of doing so. I expect their original idea was to hover about us night and day, and then, when we went ashore to get food, to steal the boat and hunt us down. Now they find we have got a second boat they will see that it is a longer job than they expected, for they will guess that our real valuables are on board the boat we hid, and that we may have enough provisions here to last for some time.\" The canoes, as they approached them, sheered off to a distance of a quarter of a mile, and then gathered together evidently in consultation. Then they turned and paddled rapidly back again, soon leaving the canoe and boat far behind. \"I wonder what they are up to now?\" Godfrey said; \"some mischief I have no doubt.\" \"Perhaps more yourts on farther? They might send on a man with fast reindeer a long way ahead, so that they might attack us with forty or fifty canoes.\" \"So they might, Luka. That would be very awkward, and we should be afraid of landing anywhere. They may pass the news on from camp to camp for any number of miles. Yes, that is a very serious business. The only thing I see for it is to make right out beyond sight of land, and then push on as fast as we can. Fortunately they don\u0027t know anything about our sail, and as they left us so fast just now they will reckon that we cannot make much more than two miles an hour; while, when we get the wind, we can go six if we help with the paddles. We may as well[325] keep on as we are at present, as if determined to keep near the land till, at any rate, we are some distance past the mouth of the river. There is not likely to be another of their camps for some distance along, for, of course, they would always be near a river, as they must have water for themselves and their reindeer.\" Paddling quietly, they continued on their course until they had passed the mouth of the river. When they had gone half a mile they saw nine canoes, each containing one man, come out from the river and follow them. \"They mean to stick to us,\" Godfrey said uneasily. \"I\u0027m afraid we are going to have a lot of trouble with them, Luka.\" After paddling for another two hours they turned their heads seaward. The canoes did the same. In four hours more the land had almost disappeared, but the clump of canoes still maintained their position behind them. \"It is of no use going out any further, Luka. We are a long way out of sight of any one on shore now. Now let us head west again.\" An hour later one of the canoes left the group and paddled rapidly towards the land. \"That is what their game is,\" Godfrey said. \"They have sent off to tell their friends ashore the course we are taking, and do what we will they will keep them informed of it. We may have a fleet of canoes out at any moment after us. Do you think we could leave them behind if we were to cast off the boat?\" Luka shook his head decidedly. \"No; their canoes are very small; paddle quick, much quicker than we could.\" \"She is very fast, Luka.\" \"Yes; but too many things on board. If we threw over everything—food, and kettles, and dog, and furs—we might go as fast as they could; but even then I think they would beat us.\" [326] \"Well, we won\u0027t try that anyhow, Luka; I would rather risk a fight than that. I don\u0027t see anything to do but to wait for the wind. It is not often calm like this long, and we have had it three or four days already. If we do get a wind we can certainly beat them by cutting loose the boat.\" \"Beat them anyhow,\" Luka said. \"With wind and paddles they might keep up with us rowing very hard for a bit; but men tire, wind never tires. We sure to beat them at last. I think we shall have wind before very long.\" \"I hope so, Luka; and not too much of it. Well, as we can\u0027t get away from them by paddling, Luka, we may as well lower our lines. We have only got two or three days\u0027 provisions on board, and we may just as well lay in a stock while we can.\" The hooks were baited with pieces of meat and lowered, and the paddles laid in. Scarcely were the lines out when Godfrey felt a fierce tug. \"Hulloa!\" he exclaimed, \"I have got something bigger than usual.\" He hauled up, and gave a shout of satisfaction as he pulled a cod of fully ten pounds weight from the water. Five minutes later Luka caught one of equal size. \"That will do, Luka. I will throw mine into the boat, and we will keep yours on board. Now we have got among cod there is no fear of our not getting plenty of food. I know they catch enormous quantities off the northern coast of Norway, and it is evident that they come as far as these waters. It is some time since we tried this deep-sea fishing, which accounts for our not having caught any before.\" \"Are they good fish?\" Luka asked. \"I have never seen any like them.\" \"First-rate, Luka, especially if we had some oyster sauce to eat with them; as we haven\u0027t we must do without. They are capital, and they are not full of bones like the herrings.[327] Now we will paddle on again. You leave that fish alone, Jack; you shall have some of it for supper.\" \"There is a dark line on the water over there,\" Luka said presently, \"wind coming.\" \"That is a comfort, Luka.\" Half an hour later the breeze came up to them. \"Shall I get up the sail, Godfrey?\" Godfrey did not reply for a minute or two. \"Yes, I think we may as well, Luka. Whether we go fast or slow these fellows will be able to send word on shore, and we may as well tire them a bit.\" The sails were hoisted, Godfrey took the sheet and laid in his paddle. \"The wind may freshen,\" he said, \"and it would not do to fasten the sheet.\" Luka, who seemed tireless, continued paddling, and the boats went through the water at a considerably faster pace than before. The effect on their pursuers was at once visible. Instead of paddling in a leisurely manner in a close group, the paddles could be seen to flash faster and faster. \"They have to row pretty hard to keep up with us now,\" Luka said, looking over his shoulder at them. \"Up to now they felt comfortable, think everything right, and quite sure to catch us presently. Now they begin to see it is not so easy after all.\" They maintained their relative positions till the sun was near the horizon. \"It is ten o\u0027clock, Luka, the sun will set in half an hour. You lay your paddle in, and get us a cup of tea and a bit of that dry meat. You had better boil the kettle over one of the candles. Then you lie down to sleep for four hours, after that I will take a turn. We are a deal better off than those fellows behind; they must keep on paddling all night, and as they only have one man in each boat there is no relief for them.\" Luka did as he was ordered. After drinking his tea[328] Godfrey lighted his pipe, and Luka lay down. Godfrey did not feel very sleepy, although he had not closed his eyes the night before; but they had had a long bout of sleep when compelled to keep their tent by the fog, and the excitement of the chase kept him up now. As it grew dusk he could see that the canoes drew closer, but he had no hope, in any case, of giving them the slip, for it was never perfectly dark. When, four hours later, he woke Luka the sky was brightening again. \"More wind come presently,\" the Tartar said, looking at the sky. \"I won\u0027t lie down just yet, Luka. It will be quite light in half an hour, and I want to have a good look towards the shore before I go to sleep.\" Luka at once took the paddle. The wind was perceptibly freshening and the canoe was slipping fast through the water. \"Now, Luka,\" Godfrey said presently, \"stand up and have a look round. Be careful how you do it; it would not do to capsize her now.\" Two minutes later Luka exclaimed, \"I see them; a whole lot of canoes, twenty or thirty, over there,\" and he pointed towards the shore but somewhat ahead of them. \"Sit down, Luka, and I will stand up and have a look. Yes, it is as much as they will do to cut us off. They did not calculate on our coming along so fast. I will luff up a little more, and we shall pass ahead of them however hard they paddle.\" So saying he sat down, hauled in the sheet and headed nearer to the wind. \"The fellows behind won\u0027t see them for some time,\" he said. \"The canoes must be four miles away at least, and I don\u0027t suppose they could see each other more than half that distance, being so low in the water. If we had just a little more wind we should do it nicely.\" [329] Half an hour later the sheet was eased again, and the boat resumed her former course, as Godfrey saw that he should pass well ahead of the canoes coming out from the shore, and she moved faster with the wind abeam than she did close-hauled. Even while sitting down the canoes could be seen now. The natives were paddling their hardest, and the light craft danced over the surface of the water, which was now beginning to be ruffled by the breeze. Half an hour later they joined the pursuers astern, and their yells could be heard although they were half a mile away. Godfrey counted them as he passed ahead of the fleet, and there were thirty-three canoes, each with two paddlers. \"The yourts must be thick along the coasts here, Luka; they must have gathered up all those canoes from at least half a dozen camps. Now I will lend you a hand.\" He eased the sheet still further, so that the boat should heel over less, and fastened it in a loose knot, which could be slipped in an instant. Then he betook himself to his paddle. \"Those fellows behind have had a long row out against the wind, and have no doubt been working their hardest ever since they caught sight of our sail. A stern-chase is a long chase. I fancy the wind has freshened a little, but it is very little.\" Occasionally he looked back over his shoulder. \"They are gaining slowly, Luka, but they are a good half mile behind us still, and it will take them two or three hours to pick that up. I am quite sure now that if we cut the boat adrift we can forge ahead, hand over hand, but that must be a last resource; it is almost a matter of life and death to be able to keep it with us. Still it is a satisfaction to know that if the worse comes to the worst we can get away from them.\" [330] Jack fully entered into the excitement of the chase, taking his seat on the covering near the stern, and barking defiance at their pursuers. Another hour\u0027s paddling and the space between the canoe and the natives was lessened by half. \"Now, Luka, I will send them a couple of bullets as a reminder that we have got weapons.\" Laying in his paddle he took his gun, turned round and knelt looking astern, and fired both barrels at the fleet of canoes. He had not taken any particular aim, for the gun was of little use at a distance exceeding a hundred yards, and the motion of the canoe would have prevented anything like accuracy of shooting even with a rifle. He intended to frighten rather than to hurt, and gave the gun a considerable elevation. He saw, however, the men in one of the canoes cease paddling and drop behind the rest, and could make out that one of its occupants was doing something. \"I hit one of the canoes, Luka; I fancy they are trying to patch up the hole.\" He loaded the gun again, this time with his largest-sized shot, laid it down and resumed his paddle. \"I have put in buck-shot this time, Luka; I don\u0027t want to kill any of the poor beggars, and the shot will spread. I have put in double charges so as to give them a good dose as they come up. Small shot would be of no use, it would not get through those thick leather coats of theirs. Now, then, let us send her along.\" The wind was certainly freshening, for it was not until another four or five miles had been traversed that the canoes had crept up to within a hundred yards\u0027 distance. At last Godfrey felt it was time to fire again, and waiting till the canoes were within about seventy yards\u0027 distance he fired both barrels, slightly shifting his aim between each shot. A series of yells arose from the canoes, four or five of them at once dropped behind. [331] \"Paddle your hardest, Luka, while I load again, the beggars are coming up fast now.\" The natives with yells of fury were sending their canoes through the foaming water, and were but fifty yards away when he again fired. This time five or six of the natives dropped their paddles, and two of the canoes were upset. A volley of arrows fell thickly round the boat, and one or two spears skimmed along the water close to it. Godfrey seized his paddle again. \"Head towards the shore, Luka,\" he said; and as the boat headed round he slackened the sheet and so brought the wind nearly dead aft. The boat was on an even keel now, and they could feel by the lessened strain on the paddles that her speed was considerably increased. In two or three minutes Godfrey looked round; the canoes were a hundred yards behind. \"We are gaining on them, Luka.\" Another ten minutes and the interval was more than doubled. \"They are beginning to get tired,\" Godfrey said. \"We are going a good deal faster, of course, now we have got the wind astern, but I do not think they are going as fast as they did, and I expect that last dose of buck-shot took the heart out of them a good deal. They had reckoned that we should be only able to fire once or twice before they came up, and that I should use bullets; but that handful of buck-shot evidently peppered a good many of them, and they know if they come up they will have four more barrels at least among them. I think the fighting is all over now.\" Another hour and the canoes were a mile astern, and the land was now but four or five miles away. Godfrey thought that he could safely resume his course west, especially as the wind had distinctly freshened. \"I will lay in my paddle now, Luka. I must give all my[332] attention to the sail. I expect they will give it up. They will think when they see me cease paddling that we know we can get away from them whenever we like.\" Godfrey\u0027s surmise turned out correct; the natives did not attempt to follow, but held on their course straight for the land, paddling slowly now. They were in two divisions, five or six of the canoes being a good deal astern of the others, those with single rowers that had followed them so long having dropped behind to pick up the occupants of the canoes that had capsized. In several of the canoes in this division Godfrey could make out that only one man was paddling, and guessed that the other was more or less disabled by the shot. \"I don\u0027t think we shall be troubled any more by them,\" he said; \"they will be a couple of hours before they reach land, by which time we shall be out of sight, and even reindeer will hardly take the news along the shore with all its deep indentations as quickly as we shall sail; besides, I fancy, they will come to the conclusion that the game is not worth the candle. Now lay in your paddle and let us have breakfast comfortably. It is just twelve o\u0027clock.\" Day after day they coasted along, passed through Waigatz Straits, between the island of that name and the mainland, then touched at four islands lying across the mouth of a large and deep bay, and then held on until they reached the mouth of the Petchora. The distance to this point from the Kara River was, Godfrey calculated, about three hundred and fifty miles. It took them fifteen days to cover that distance, as they stopped and spent a day shooting several times, for they were not fortunate along here in catching many fish as they went. On passing one of the islands Godfrey shot a seal, the flesh of which they found was by no means bad. The weather continued very fine, but there was so little[333] wind that during the whole distance they did not once put up their sail, but depended entirely upon their paddles. Upon one of their shooting expeditions Godfrey had the good luck to shoot a very fine black fox. They had had their meal and were stretched at full length by the fire. Luka had gone off to sleep. Godfrey was almost dozing when he heard a slight rustle in the grass, and opening his eyes saw a black fox standing at a distance of ten paces. It had evidently been attracted by the smell of some fish they had been frying, and stood with its nose in the air sniffing. Godfrey\u0027s gun was lying beside him, the left-hand barrel he always kept loaded with ball. His hands stole quietly to it, and as he grasped it he sat up and fired a snap shot at the fox as it turned and darted away. To his surprise as well as delight it rolled over. \"There is a piece of luck, Luka,\" he said, as the latter sprang to his feet bow in hand at the report. \"That is a pure fluke, for I fired without raising the gun or taking the least aim.\" Luka examined the fox. \"It is one of the largest I ever saw,\" he said, \"and the fur is in splendid condition.\" \"Its skin will come in handy, Luka. We must put in and replenish our stores at Droinik, at the mouth of the Petchora. We are running very short of tea and tobacco, we have been very extravagant lately, and we have had no flour since those scamps robbed us. It is very lucky Jack was so sound asleep. I often scold you, Jack, for being such a sleepy little beggar, but for once it is lucky, for if you had heard the fox coming he would have been off without my getting a shot at him.\" Accordingly when they reached the mouth of the Petchora they landed three miles from Droinik, and Luka, taking the fox-skin and those of other smaller animals they had shot during their excursions, went into the town, and[334] returned with four pounds of tea, as much tobacco, forty pounds of flour, two large tin kettles, each capable of holding a gallon of water, to carry an extra supply, and sixty silver roubles. \"I am heartily glad you are back, Luka, for I have been nearly eaten alive; the mosquitoes are awful—worse, I think, than at any place we have landed.\" They had indeed entirely given up sleeping ashore since their forced stay on the Gulf of Obi, always pushing off two or three hundred yards from the shore and anchoring, for the mosquitoes were terrible; and upon their hunting expeditions they always smeared their faces, necks, and hands thickly over with bears\u0027 fat, but even with this they suffered severely. Nowhere, indeed, are mosquitoes so great a scourge as along the shores of the Arctic Sea. They had already determined that they would at any rate make for the Kanin Peninsula, and would then be guided by the weather. If it still remained calm and quiet, they would sail across the entrance to the White Sea, and coast along until they reached the frontier of Norway, which would be about four hundred miles from the point of the Kanin Peninsula; if the weather showed signs of changing they would go up the White Sea to Archangel, which would be about the same distance. Two days\u0027 paddling took them to the western mouth of the bay, the course from here lay due west to Kolgueff Island, nearly two hundred miles away. Godfrey did not hesitate to strike for it, as it was seventy or eighty miles saved, and there was no risk of missing it. Four long days\u0027 paddling took them there, and an equal time brought them to the western point of the Kanin Peninsula. The weather continued still and clear, the sea was as smooth as glass, and there were no signs of change; but September had begun, and every hour was of importance. They therefore[335] determined now to abandon the boat, which made a considerable difference in their speed. \"Our candles will do for cooking. We have still forty pounds of dried flesh, and twenty of flour, and we may expect to get a few fish anyhow. Our three kettles will hold two gallons and a half of water, enough to last us seven or eight days. In three days at most we ought to strike the coast again, and we are sure to find some streams running down to the sea in a very short time, so we will risk it. We know that the two of us can send her along a good five miles an hour.\" Accordingly the dried meat and flour were transferred to the canoe, the kettles were filled up with fresh water, and, after taking a long drink and letting Jack lap as much as he could take, they took their seats in the canoe again, threw off the tow-rope and started due west. Accustomed as they now were to the work, and their muscles hardened by exercise, they sent the boat rapidly through the water. \"We mustn\u0027t exert ourselves too much, Luka,\" Godfrey said after the first quarter of an hour. \"A long slow stroke is the one to send her along, and we can keep that up for any time. We must do our very best till we sight the coast again. After the way she behaved in that storm I am not afraid of wind, but I am horribly afraid of fog. If we had but a compass it would not matter to us one way or other; but if a fog came down when we are a good way off the land, there would be nothing to do but to lay in our paddles and wait, even if it lasted for a fortnight. Still, as long as there is no change of weather, there does not seem any reason why a fog should set in; but I shall not feel happy till we have got the land alongside of us.\" For three days the paddles were kept going, each taking alternately six hours\u0027 sleep, and working together for twelve.[336] Jack having nothing to do was the most uneasy of the party, sometimes lying down with his nose between his paws, sometimes getting up and giving a series of short impatient barks. Early on the second day they were fortunate in passing through a large shoal of herrings. Godfrey laid in his paddles and attended to the lines, and in half an hour had forty-five fish. After that they paid no further attention to fishing, being now amply supplied with food. The herrings, too, required less water than the dried meat. They fried them over the candles, and whenever their mouths were parched they chewed a piece of raw herring and found great relief from it. Jack was allowed two raw herrings a day; with that and a very small allowance of water he did very well. On the third day a light southerly wind sprang up, and they at once hoisted their sail and found that it eased their labour materially. \"I should think we ought to see the land to-night, Luka; three days at eighty miles a day is two hundred and forty miles. If we don\u0027t see it by evening, we must head a little more to the south. Of course we cannot depend very accurately on our steering, and we may have been going a trifle north of west all this time. But it is all right, for the coast we are making for keeps on trending north, and we are certain to hit it sooner or later.\" At six o\u0027clock they had a meal which Luka had been cooking, and then Godfrey said, \"Now I will have my six hours\u0027 sleep.\" He stood up to change places and let Luka come astern to steer, when he exclaimed, \"Look, is that a cloud ahead of us, or is it land?\" \"Land!\" Luka said after gazing at it attentively. \"It is high land.\" All idea of sleep was given up. Godfrey seized his paddle again, and in four hours they were within a mile of the land. It differed widely from the low coast they had so[337] long been passing. Steep hills rose from the very edge of the shore, clad in many places with pine forests. They were not long before they found a suitable place to land, and soon had the canoe ashore and the tent erected, for the nights were already becoming unpleasantly cold. Luka went into the woods, and soon returned with some dried branches and a quantity of pine cones. Godfrey cut three sticks and made a tripod, from which the small kettle was suspended, and fish and meat were soon grilling over the fire. As soon as the kettle boiled a handful of tea was dropped into it, and it was taken off the fire. The three companions made an excellent meal, then Luka and Godfrey lighted their pipes and sat smoking by the fire for half an hour, and then lay down in the tent for a sound sleep. When Godfrey woke he found that Luka was already up. He had stirred up the embers, put on fresh wood, filled the kettle and hung it over the fire, and had then evidently sauntered off into the wood. Godfrey, after the luxury of a rapid bathe, began to prepare breakfast, and by the time it was ready Luka came down with a dozen squirrels he had shot. \"Lots of them in the wood,\" he said; \"if stop here three or four days, get lots of skins.\" \"I don\u0027t think they would be much good to us, Luka, though those you shot will be useful for food; but I have been obliged to stand with my head over the smoke of the fire to keep off these rascally mosquitoes, and my face was so swelled with their bites when I woke that I could hardly see out of my eyes till I bathed my face with cold water. The sooner we are off the better, if we don\u0027t want to be eaten alive.\" Accordingly, as soon as the meal was finished they packed up and continued their voyage. After eight hours\u0027 paddling they came upon the mouth of a river. [338] \"This must be the Seriberka,\" Godfrey said. \"That is the only river marked in the map anywhere about here. We will paddle a mile or two up and fill our kettles. If it is that river, we shall come upon an island a few miles off the coast, in another twenty or thirty miles. See, Luka, how near we are getting to the end of the map. We are not very much more than a hundred miles from this line; that is the division between Russia and Norway. Once we land on the other side of that line we are free.\" In seven or eight hours after leaving the river, Godfrey said, \"There is Kildina Island, Luka. We will land over there instead of upon this shore. There may be some Laplanders about, and there is a Russian place called Kola about twenty miles up a river a little way past the island, and the natives might take us there if they came upon us, for they would not understand either Ostjak or the Samoyede dialect, and I don\u0027t suppose they would talk Russian. Anyhow, we may as well be on the safe side. After coming seven or eight thousand miles we won\u0027t run any risk of a failure in the last hundred. I don\u0027t much like the look of the sky away to the north. I fancy we are going to have a storm. Thank God it did not come two days earlier.\" They landed on the island, hauled up the boat, then Godfrey took some time in finding a hollow where they could light a fire without risk of its being seen on the mainland, as, if there were Lapps there, they might cross in their canoes to see who had made it. They had no trouble in collecting plenty of drift-wood along the shore, and carefully choosing the driest, so as to avoid making a great smoke, they lit a fire and erected the tent to leeward of it, so that the smoke might blow through it, and so keep out their enemies the mosquitoes. Godfrey\u0027s prediction about the weather was speedily verified. The wind got up very[339] rapidly, and in two hours was blowing a gale from the north. \"No fear of canoes coming across,\" Luka said. \"No fear at all. I don\u0027t suppose there was any real risk of it in any case, but I feel more nervous now than I have done all the time. At any rate the storm has made it perfectly safe. There will soon be a sea on that no canoe could face.\" For three days the storm raged, and they were glad to resume their fur jackets. Jack lay coiled up in the furs in the tent, and nothing could persuade him to move except for breakfast and dinner. They waited twelve hours after the gale ceased to allow the sea to go down and then started again, hoisting their sail as there was enough wind to help them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3148/86498.html","bookId":785,"book":{"id":785,"title":"Condemned as a Nihilist","description":"简介： HALF a dozen boys were gathered in one of the studies at Shrewsbury.
