{"id":32390,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. AN ESCAPE.","content":"The evenings were spent principally in conversations about Siberia, Godfrey being eager to learn everything that he could about its geography and peoples. Alexis told him all he knew as to the mountains and rivers, the various native tribes, the districts where the[105] villages were comparatively numerous, and the mighty forests that, stretching away to the Arctic Sea, could hardly be said to be explored. Books and paper were forbidden to the political prisoners, and so strict were the regulations that the warders would not under any considerations bring them in. But Godfrey wrote all the particulars that he judged might in any way be useful with a burnt piece of stick upon the table as Alexis gave them, and then learned them by heart, washing them off after he had done so. But few of the details Alexis could give him would be of any use in the attempt he first intended to make. The southern frontier was so temptingly close that it seemed absurd to turn from that and to attempt a tremendous journey north, involving the certainty of having to struggle through an Arctic winter, and to face the difficulties of the passage west, either by land or sea. Beyond the fact that from Irkutsk he would have to make for the southern point of Lake Baikal, some sixty miles away, and then strike about south-east for another two hundred through a country inhabited almost entirely by Buriats, the doctor could tell him little. \"Kiakhta,\" he said, \"or rather, as far as the Russians are concerned, Troitzkosavsk, which is a sort of suburb of Kiakhta, is the frontier town. Kiakhta is a sort of neutral town inhabited only by merchants, and by a treaty between Russia and China no officer or stranger is allowed to sleep there. Across the frontier, a few miles away, is the Chinese, or I suppose I should say the Mongol, town of Maimatchin. Beyond the fact that the people about there are Mongols rather than Chinese, and that such religion as they have is that of Thibet rather than China, for their priests are called lamas, I know nothing except that the caravan route from Kiakhta to Pekin is somewhere about a thousand miles, and that the camels do it in about thirty-five days.\" \"Then they make about thirty miles a day,\" Godfrey said. \"I suppose there must be wells at their halting-places.\" [106] \"Ah! that is another matter, Godfrey. You see a camel can go three days without water easily enough, and of course they would carry skins of water for the travellers.\" \"Oh, that is no odds,\" Godfrey said. \"One could walk the ninety miles easily enough in three days, and there would be no difficulty in carrying water enough for that time. Besides, one would of course join a caravan if one could. Luckily enough I had two hundred roubles in notes when I was captured, and they restored them as well as my watch and other things when I started. I suppose the Mongols are just as fond of money as other people. The Chinese are, certainly, and I might get some Chinese tea-merchant to let me go in his train for a consideration.\" The Russian laughed. \"\u0027Pon my word, Godfrey, I begin to think you will do it.\" \"There can\u0027t be anything impossible in doing it,\" Godfrey said. \"Why, did not Burton disguise himself and go with a caravan to Mecca and visit the holy places, and that was twenty times as difficult and dangerous. Going along the caravan route of course the difficulty is the language and the Buriats. If one could talk Mongol, or whatever the fellows call their language, it would be easy sailing; but I own that it is a difficult thing to get along and explain what you want with people who cannot understand a word you say. I suppose the Buriats speak Russian.\" \"I should say that a great many of them do, Godfrey. I know there are missionaries and schools among them, and some of them live in settled villages, though they are so wedded to their own wandering life that they build their houses on the exact model of their tents, with a hole in the roof to let the smoke out. Still, as they deal with the towns and come in to sell their cattle and sheep and herds and so on, no doubt the greater part of them, at any rate on this side of the frontier, speak a certain amount of Russian. The difficulty will be to persuade them not to give you up.\" [107] \"But I can pay them more not to give me up than they can get for doing so,\" Godfrey said. \"They would kill you for what you have, Godfrey. They are permitted to kill runaways, in fact encouraged to do so, and the reward is the same whether they are brought in dead or alive.\" \"I should think, Alexis, it is easier to bring in a live man than a dead one.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" the Russian laughed. \"I don\u0027t think a Buriat would find it very easy to take you any distance alive, but there would be no trouble in chucking you into a cart and bringing you here after the preliminary operation of knocking you on the head.\" Godfrey smiled. \"You forget there would be some preliminary trouble in knocking me on the head, Alexis; but seriously, I don\u0027t think any natives who have been in contact at all with civilization are disposed to take life without some strong motive. Of course robbery would be a motive, but I should certainly have nothing about me that a Tartar or a Buriat—I suppose they are all something of the same thing—would covet. You were telling me yourself that many of these people have very large flocks and herds. Is it likely such people as these would cut a stranger\u0027s throat on the chance of finding a few roubles in his pocket?\" \"Well, one would think not, Godfrey; but of course they are not all rich.\" \"No; they may not be rich, but you say they are always nomads. Well, people who are nomads must always have some sort of animals to carry their tents, and a certain amount, anyhow, of cattle, horses, or sheep. No, I don\u0027t at all believe in cutting throats without a motive.\" \"But let us understand a little more about your intentions, Godfrey. Do you mean to climb over that fence and then to stroll away to the south with your hands in your pockets and your hat on one side of your head, and to ask[108] the first man you come upon to direct you to the shortest road to Pekin?\" Godfrey laughed. \"No, not quite that, Alexis. These clothes did very well in St. Petersburg, and though they are all the worse for the journey here I daresay they would pass well enough in the streets of Irkutsk. The first thing to do will be to get some clothes, for as far as I could see coming along the natives all dress a good deal like the Russians. I suppose in winter they wrap up more in furs, or they may wear their furs differently, but any sort of peasant dress would do, as it would not excite attention, while this tweed suit would be singular even in the streets here.\" \"That fur-lined great-coat would be all right, Godfrey.\" \"Yes. I bought that at St. Petersburg. I don\u0027t know that it would go very well with a peasant\u0027s dress, and it is certainly not suitable for the time of year, though I shall take it with me if I can. If I could roll it up and carry it as a knapsack it would be first rate for sleeping in, besides it might do as something to exchange when one gets to places where money is of little use. If I can get hold of a pistol anyhow I shall be glad. A pistol will always produce civility if one meets only one or two men. The other things I should want are a box of matches for making fires, a good knife, or better still, a small axe, for chopping wood, and a bottle or skin for holding water.\" \"You will be seized and sent back in a week, Godfrey.\" \"Very well, then, there will be no harm done. I regard this as a sort of preliminary investigation. I shall ascertain the difficulties of travel in Siberia, and shall learn lessons for next time. I believe myself the true way is to strike one of the great rivers, to build or steal a boat, to go down in it to the Arctic Sea, and then to coast along until one gets to Norway; but that is a big affair, and besides it is a great deal too late in the year for it. When I attempt that I shall make off as early in the spring as possible.\" [109] \"Remember you may be flogged when you are caught, Godfrey.\" \"Well, I shouldn\u0027t like to be flogged, but as you say the convicts don\u0027t think much of it, I suppose I could bear it. They used to flog in our army and navy till quite lately.\" \"It is a dishonour,\" Alexis exclaimed passionately. Godfrey shrugged his shoulders. \"The dishonour lies in the crime and not in the punishment,\" he said. \"At our great public schools in England fellows are flogged. Well, there is no disgrace in it if it\u0027s only for breaking the rules or anything of that sort, but it would be a horrible dishonour if it were for thieving. All that sort of thing is absurd. I believe flogging is the best punishment there is. It is a lot better to give a man a couple of dozen and send him about his business, than it is to keep him for a year in prison at the public expense, and to have to maintain his wife and children also at the public expense while he is there. Besides, I thought you said the other day that they did not flog political prisoners.\" \"Well, they don\u0027t, at least not at any of the large prisons; but in some of the small establishments, with perhaps a brutal drunken captain or major as governor, no doubt it may be done sometimes.\" \"Well, I will take my chance of it.\" \"And when do you think of starting?\" Alexis asked after a pause. \"Directly. I have only to decide how I am to get out after the door is locked, and to make a rope of some sort to climb the fence with. The blankets tied together will do for that. As to the getting out there is no difficulty. One only has to throw a blanket over that cross beam, get up on that, and get off one of the lining boards, displace a few tiles, crawl through.\" \"I have half a mind to go with you, Godfrey.\" \"Have you, Alexis? I should be awfully glad, but at the same time I would not say a word to persuade you to do it.[110] You know I make light of it, but I know very well that there will be some danger and a tremendous lot of hardship to be gone through.\" \"I don\u0027t think I am afraid of that, Godfrey,\" Alexis said seriously. \"It is not that I have been thinking of ever since you began to talk to me of getting away. I consider it is a hundred to one against success; but, as you say, if we fail and get brought back no great harm is done. If we get killed or die of hunger and thirst, again no harm is done, for certainly life is not a thing to cling to when one is a prisoner in Siberia; but it is not that. You see I am differently situated to you. If you do succeed in getting away you go home, and you are all right; if I succeed in getting away what is to become of me? I speak Russian and German, but there would be no return for me to Russia unless some day when a new Czar ascends the throne, or on some such occasion, when a general amnesty is granted; but even that would hardly extend to political prisoners. What am I to do? So far as I can see I might starve, and after all one might almost as well remain here as starve in Pekin or in some Chinese port. Granted that I could work my way back to Europe on board ship, what should I do if I landed at Marseilles or Liverpool? I could not go through the streets shouting in German \u0027I am a doctor, who wants to be cured?\u0027\" \"No, Alexis,\" Godfrey agreed, \"you could not well do that; but I will tell you what you could do. Of course at the first place I get to, where there is a telegraph to England, I will send a message to my father to cable to some firm there to let me have what money I require. Very well. Then, of course, you would go home with me to England, and there is one thing I could promise you, and that is a post in my father\u0027s office. You know we trade with Russia, and though our correspondence is generally carried on in German, I am quite sure that my father would, after you had been my companion on such a journey as that we pro[111]pose, make a berth for you in the office to undertake correspondence in Russian and German, and that he would pay a salary quite sufficient for you to live in comfort; or if you would rather, I am sure that he would find you means for going out and settling, say in the United States, in the part where German is the general language.\" \"Then in that case, Godfrey,\" the Russian said, shaking his hand warmly, \"I am your man. I think I should have gone with you anyhow; but what you have said quite decides me. Now, then, what is our first proceeding?\" Godfrey laughed. \"I should say to take an inventory of our belongings, Alexis, or rather of your belongings, for mine are very briefly described. Two hundred roubles in notes, a watch, a pocket-knife, the suit of clothes I stand up in, half a dozen pairs of socks, and three flannel shirts I bought on the way, one great-coat lined with fur; I think that is about all. It is a very small share. Yours are much more numerous.\" \"More numerous, but not much more useful,\" Alexis said. \"They let me bring one large portmanteau of clothes, but as I can\u0027t carry that away on my shoulders it is of very little use. All I can take in that way is a suit of clothes and a spare flannel shirt or two, and some socks. I have got two cases of surgical instruments. I will take a few of the most useful and some other things, a pair of forceps for instance. We may come across a Tartar with a raging tooth, and make him our friend for ever by extracting it, and I will put a bandage or two and some plaster in my pocket. They are things one ought always to carry, for one is always liable to get a hurt or a sprain. As to money, I have a hundred and twenty roubles; they are all in silver. I changed my paper at Tobolsk, thinking that silver would be more handy here. Unfortunately they took away my pistol, but a couple of amputating knives will make good weapons. I have got a leather waistcoat, which[112] I will cut up and make from it a couple of sheaths. Of course I have got fur cloaks, one of them a very handsome one. I will take that and another. There ought to be no difficulty whatever in getting some one to give us two peasants\u0027 dresses in exchange for that coat, for all these people know something of the value of furs.\" \"Yes, and if you can get a gun and some ammunition thrown into the bargain, Alexis, it will be most useful, for we may have to depend upon what we shoot sometimes.\" \"Yes, that would be a great addition, Godfrey. Well, we will set about making the sheaths at once. I have got a store of needles and stout thread.\" \"They will be useful to take with us,\" Godfrey said, \"not only for mending our clothes, if we want it, but for exchange. Women have to sew all over the world, and even the most savage people can appreciate the advantage of a good needle.\" \"That is so, Godfrey. I have got a packet of capital surgical needles, and some silk. I will put them in with the others; they won\u0027t take up much room. Well, shall we start to-morrow night?\" \"I think we had better wait for two or three days,\" Godfrey said. \"We must save up some of our food.\" \"Yes, we shall want some bread,\" Alexis agreed. \"We can\u0027t well get that in through the warders, it would look suspicious, but I will get in some meat through them. We have got some of the last lot left, so we can do with very little bread.\" For the next two days they found plenty to occupy them, while their stock of bread was accumulating. One of the Russian\u0027s coats was cut up and made into two bags like haversacks, with a band to pass over the shoulder, for carrying their belongings. Straps were make of the cloth for fastening the great-coats knapsack fashion. They agreed that however long they might have to wait they must choose a stormy night for their flight, as otherwise they could hardly[113] break through the roof and scale the fence without being heard by the sentries who kept watch night and day. They were eager to be off, for it was already the end of July, and the winter would be severe in the country over which they had to travel. On the fourth day a heavy rain set in, and in the evening it began to blow hard. \"Now is our time,\" Godfrey said; \"nothing could have been better.\" They had already loosened two of the lining boards of the roof, and as soon as they had been locked up for the night they removed these altogether. They packed their haversacks with the articles they had agreed to take, with six pounds of bread each and some meat, rolled four blankets up and knotted them tightly together, strapped up the three fur-lined cloaks, and placed the knives in their belts. Then without much difficulty they prised up one of the thick planks with which the hut was roofed. Godfrey got through the opening, and Alexis passed out to him the haversacks and coats, and then joined him, and they slid down the roof and dropped to the ground. The paling was but twenty yards behind the huts. As soon as they reached it Godfrey climbed upon his companion\u0027s shoulders, threw the loop of a doubled rope over one of the palisades and climbed on to the top. Then with the rope he pulled up the coats and haversacks and dropped them outside. Alexis pulled himself up by the rope; this was then dropped on the outside and he slid down by it. Godfrey shifted the rope on to the point of one of the palings, so that it could be easily shaken off from below, and then slipped down it. The rope shaken off and two of the blankets opened, the haversacks hung over their shoulders, and the great-coats strapped on, each put one of the twisted blankets over his shoulder, scarf fashion, wrapped the other round as a cloak, and then set out on their way. Fortunately the prison lay on the south side of the town and at a distance of half a mile from it; and as[114] their course to the extremity of Lake Baikal lay almost due south, they were able to strike right across the country. The wind was from the north, and they had therefore only to keep their backs to it to follow the right direction. It was half-past ten when they started, for the nights were short, and had it not been that the sky was covered with clouds and the air thick with rain, it would not have been dark enough for them to make the attempt until an hour later. By three o\u0027clock it was light again, but they knew there was little chance of their escape being discovered until the warders came to unlock the hut at six in the morning, as the planks they had removed from the roof were at the back of the hut, and therefore invisible to the sentries. \"No doubt they will send a few mounted Cossacks out to search for us, as we are political prisoners,\" Alexis said; \"but we may calculate it will be seven o\u0027clock before they set out, and as this is the very last direction they will imagine we have taken we need not trouble ourselves about them; besides, we shall soon be getting into wooded country. I believe it is all wood round the lower end of the lake, and we shall be quite out of the way of traffic, for everything going east from Irkutsk is taken across the lake by steamer.\" After twelve hours\u0027 walking, with only one halt of half an hour for refreshment, they reached the edge of the forest, and after again making a hearty meal of their bread and cold meat, and taking each a sip from a bottle containing cold tea, they lay down and slept until late in the afternoon. \"Well, we have accomplished so much satisfactorily,\" Alexis said. \"Now we have to keep on to Kaltuk, at the extreme south-western point of the lake. It is a very small place, I believe, and that is where we must get what we want. We shall be there by the evening. We shall be just right, as it wouldn\u0027t do for us to go in until it is pretty nearly dark. A place of that sort is sure to have a store where they sell clothes and other things, and trade with the people round.\" [115] They struck the lake a mile or two from its extremity, and following it until they could see the roofs of the houses lay down for an hour until it should be dark enough to enter. \"We had better put on our fur coats,\" Alexis said. \"The people all wear long coats of some fashion or other, and in the dusk we shall pass well enough.\" It was a village containing some fifty or sixty houses, for the most part the tent-like structures of the Buriats. They met no one in the street, and kept on until they saw a light in a window of a house larger than any others, and looking in saw that it was the place for which they were in search. Opening the door they went in and closed it behind them. A man came out from the room behind the shop. He stopped for a moment at seeing two strangers, then advanced with a suspicious look on his face. \"Do you want a bargain?\" Alexis asked him abruptly. \"I have little money to buy with,\" he said sullenly. \"That matters little, for we will take it out in goods.\" The man hesitated. Alexis drew out the long keen amputating knife. \"Look here,\" he said. \"We are not to be fooled with. You may guess what we are or not; it is nothing to us and nothing to you. We want some of your goods, and are ready to give you good exchange for them; we are not robbers. Here is this coat; look at it; it is almost unworn. I have used it only one winter. You can see it is lined with real sable, and it cost me three hundred roubles. At any rate, it is worth a hundred to you, even if you take out the lining, sell the skins separately, and burn the coat. Examine it for yourself.\" The shopkeeper did so. \"They are good skins,\" he said, and Alexis could see that he quite appreciated their value. \"Now,\" Alexis said, \"I want two peasant dresses complete, coat, trousers, high boots, and caps. What do you charge for them?\" \"Twenty roubles each suit.\" [116] \"Very well. Pick two suits the right size for us, and lay them down on the counter. Now we want two pounds of brick-tea and two pounds of tobacco. We want two skins that will each hold a gallon or a gallon and a half of water, and a tin pot that will hold a quart, and two tin drinking mugs. We want a gun and ammunition; it need not be a new one. I see you have got half a dozen standing over there in the corner. What do you charge your customers for those? I see they are all old single barrels and flint-locks.\" \"I charge fifteen roubles a piece.\" \"Well we will take two of them, and we want two pounds of powder and six pounds of shot, and a couple of dozen bullets. Now add that up and see how much it comes to.\" \"Ninety-two roubles,\" the man said. \"Well, I tell you what. I will give you this cloak and twelve paper roubles for them. I don\u0027t suppose the goods cost you fifty at the outside, and you will get at least a hundred for the skins alone.\" \"I will take it,\" the man said. \"I take it because I cannot help it.\" \"You take it because you are making an excellent bargain,\" Alexis said fiercely. \"Now, mind, if you give the alarm when we have gone it will be worse for you. They won\u0027t catch us; but you will see your house on fire over your head before the week is past.\" Godfrey placed a ten-rouble note and two one-rouble notes on the table; they gathered up their goods and made them into a bundle, carefully loaded their guns, and put the powder and shot into their haversacks. Then Alexis lifted the bundle, and shouldering the guns they left the shop. \"Will he give the alarm, do you think?\" Godfrey asked. \"Not he. He is thoroughly well satisfied. I daresay he will get a hundred and fifty roubles for the coat; besides, he knows that escaped convicts are desperate men, and that we should be likely to execute my threat. Besides, I don\u0027t[117] suppose he would venture to stir out. For aught he knows we may be waiting just outside the shop to see what he does, and he will fear that he might get that hungry-looking knife into him if he came out to raise the alarm.\" All was quiet, and they were soon beyond the limits of the village, and struck out for the country. They held on for two or three miles, filled their water-skins at a little stream running towards the lake, and then entering a wood pushed on for some little distance, lighted a fire, and made themselves some tea. \"We are fairly off now, Godfrey. We have become what they call wanderers, and should be safe enough among the Russian peasants, most of whom have been convicts in their time, in the villages north, for they are always willing enough to help men who have taken to the woods. Well, except in the villages, of which there are few enough about here, we are not likely to come upon them. From here to the frontier are Buriats, and indeed beyond the frontier. However as we have both got guns, we need not be afraid of any small party. Of course some of them have guns too; but I don\u0027t suppose they will be fools enough to risk throwing their lives away for nothing. At any rate there is one comfort. There is nothing to show that we are political prisoners now. We might be honest peasants if it were not for these confounded heads of hair.\" \"I should think,\" Godfrey said, \"we had better get rid of our hair altogether. It will be some time before it grows, but anything will be better than it is now.\" \"We have got no scissors, Godfrey, and we have no soap. If we had, those knives of ours are sharp enough to shave with.\" \"We can singe it off,\" Godfrey said. \"Not now, but in the morning when we can see. I will do it for you, and you can do it for me. I would rather be bald-headed altogether than be such a figure as I am now.\" Accordingly in the morning they singed off their hair with[118] red-hot brands, then they changed their clothes for those they had obtained the night before, folded up their great-coats, divided the tea, tobacco, and the greater part of the powder and shot between them, put a portion in their haversacks, and rolled the rest up in the coats, then strapped these to their shoulders and started on their way. \"Now I feel ready for anything,\" Alexis said as they tramped along. \"We have no weight to speak of to carry, and we have means of getting a meal occasionally. Now if we keep a little west of south we shall strike the Selenga river, which runs through Maimatchin, and then we shall be in China. We shall have to avoid the town, because I know there is a treaty between Russia and China about sending back exiles who cross the frontier. Still, when we get there we are at the starting-place of the caravans.\" \"Is it a desert the whole distance?\" \"No. The first part is a mountainous country with two or three rivers to cross. I don\u0027t think the real desert is more than eight or ten days\u0027 march across. We shall certainly have no difficulty about water for some time to come. There are plenty of squirrels in these woods; at least I expect so, for they abound in all the forests. We must knock some of them over if we can. I believe they are not bad eating, though I never tried one. Then by the streams we ought to be able to pick up some wild duck, though of course at this time of year the greater portion of them are far north. Still I have great hopes we shall be able to keep ourselves in food with the assistance of what we may be able to buy occasionally. I think the only thing we have got to fear at this part of our journey is the Buriats. The thing I am really afraid of is the getting into China. I don\u0027t mean the frontier here; this is Mongolia, and it is only nominally Chinese; but when we get across the desert and enter China itself, I tell you frankly I don\u0027t see our way. We neither of us can speak a word of the language. We have no papers, and we may be arrested and shut up as[119] suspicious vagabonds. There is one thing; at Kalgan, which is close to the Great Wall, there are Russian traders, and I should go boldly to them and ask their help. Russians out of Russia are sure to be liberal, though they may not dare to be so when they are at home, and I feel sure they would help us when we tell them our story, if we can only get at them. However we need not trouble ourselves much about that at present.\" Once beyond the forest they were in an undulating country, the hills sometimes rising to a considerable height. Occasionally they saw in the distance encampments of natives, with sheep, cattle, and horses in considerable numbers. They kept clear of these, although occasionally they had to make wide detours to do so. Time was no object to them, and they made but short journeys, for the Russian, who had never been accustomed to walk long distances, had blistered both his feet badly on the first night\u0027s journey, and the subsequent travelling had added to the inflammation. On the fourth evening they halted for the night on a little rivulet, after making only five or six miles. \"It is no use, Alexis,\" Godfrey said; \"we must stop here until your feet are quite well. We shall gain by it rather than lose, for when you are quite right again we could do our five-and-twenty or thirty miles a day easily, and might do forty at a push; but your feet will never get well if you go on walking, and it makes your journey a perfect penance; so I vote we establish ourselves here for three or four days. There is water and wood, and I dare say I shall be able to shoot something—at any rate you can\u0027t go on as you are now.\" \"It is horribly annoying,\" Alexis said, \"to be knocked up like this just at the start.\" \"But it makes no difference,\" Godfrey urged. \"We are not due at Pekin on any given day. It is very pleasant out here, where one can enjoy one\u0027s freedom and exult that[120] there is no policeman or Cossack watching every movement. It would make no difference to me if we stopped here for a month. Now let me pull those boots off for you, then you can sit with your feet in this little pool.\" \"Warm water would be better, Godfrey. If you will get the kettle to boil I will dip my two flannel shirts in and wrap them round and keep on at that. That will be better than cold water.\" \"All right! I will soon get a fire alight. By Jove, they are bad!\" he exclaimed, as Alexis pulled off his stocking. \"They must have been hurting you desperately. Why did you not say how bad they were two days ago? We might as well have stopped then as now.\" \"I hoped they would have got better when I put on these big boots instead of those I started with. But I did not think they were as bad as they are. I am afraid this is going to be a troublesome business, Godfrey.\" \"Well, it can\u0027t be helped,\" Godfrey said cheerfully. \"At any rate, don\u0027t worry on my account.\" The Russian\u0027s feet were indeed greatly swollen and inflamed. The skin had been rubbed off in several places, and the wounds had an angry look, their edges being a fiery red, which extended for some distance round them. \"Well, you have plenty of pluck, Alexis, or you never could have gone on walking with such feet as those. I am sure I could not have done so.\" \"We thought over most difficulties, Godfrey, that we might possibly have to encounter, but not of this.\" \"No, we did not think of it, though we might really have calculated upon it. After being three or four months without walking twenty yards it is only natural one\u0027s feet should go at first. We ought to have brought some soap with us—I do not mean for washing, though we ought to have brought it for that—but for soaping the inside of our stockings. That is a first-rate dodge to prevent feet from blistering. Well, I must see about the fire. I will go up to[121] those trees on the hillside. I daresay I shall be able to find some sticks there for lighting it. These bushes round here will do well enough when it is once fairly burning, but we shall have a great trouble to get them to light to begin with.\" A SUPPER OF ROASTED SQUIRRELS. A SUPPER OF ROASTED SQUIRRELS. In half an hour he was back with a large faggot. \"It is lucky,\" he said, \"there is a fallen tree. So we shall have no difficulty about firewood. We ought to have brought a hatchet when we got the other things. These knives are first-rate for cutting meat and that sort of thing, but they are of no use for rough work. My old knife is better.\" While he was talking he was engaged in cutting some shavings off the sticks. Then he split up another into somewhat larger pieces, and laying them over the shavings, struck a match, and applied it. The flame shot up brightly, and in five minutes there was an excellent fire, on which the kettle was placed. \"We had better have our dinner first, Godfrey. Then I can go on steadily with these fomentations while you take your gun and look round.\" \"Perhaps that will be the best way,\" Godfrey said. \"We have nothing left but six squirrels. We finished the last piece of bread this morning and the meat last night. How had we better do these squirrels?\" \"I will skin them, Godfrey, while you are seeing to the fire. Then we will spit them on a ramrod, and I will hold them in the flame.\" \"I think we can manage better than that,\" Godfrey said, and he went to the bushes and cut two sticks of a foot long with a fork at one end. He stuck these in the ground, on the opposite sides of the fire. \"There,\" he said, \"you can lay the ramrod on these forks, and all you have got to do is to give it a turn occasionally.\" \"How long do you suppose these things want cooking?\" \"Not above five minutes, I should think. I know that a[122] steak only takes about eight minutes before a good fire, and these little beggars are not half the thickness of a steak. They are beginning to frizzle already, and the water is just on the boil.\" The squirrels were pronounced very good eating. When the meal was over Godfrey filled the kettle again and gave it to Alexis, and then, taking his gun, started down the valley. He was away three hours, and brought back twenty birds of various sorts, but for the most part small. \"No very great sport,\" he said as he emptied his haversack. \"However, they will do for breakfast, and I may have better luck to-morrow. There are some fish in the pools, but I do not see how we are to get them. I saw one spring out of the water; it must have weighed a couple of pounds.\" \"You might shoot them, Godfrey, if you could find a place where the bank is pretty high so as to look down on the water.\" \"So I could; I did not think of that. I must try to-morrow.\" \"If it hadn\u0027t been for my feet,\" Alexis said, \"we should have been down on the Selenga to-morrow, and we had calculated on being able to buy food at one of the villages there.\" \"We shall be able to hold on here,\" Godfrey said, \"for a few days, and I expect that one day\u0027s good tramp, when your feet are better, will take us there. After that we ought to have no great difficulty till we get down near the desert.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3148/86487.html","bookId":785,"book":{"id":785,"title":"Condemned as a Nihilist","description":"简介： HALF a dozen boys were gathered in one of the studies at Shrewsbury.
