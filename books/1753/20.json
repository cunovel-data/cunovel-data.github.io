{"id":71610,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"A living initiate of the Apparatus--the woman\u0027s name was Farre-- also stood by. The captain grimaced at the sight of her. The politicals had kept a close watch on the Rixwoman and Rana Harter since their arrival on the Lynx. An Imperial writ gave them absolute power over the two prisoners.\n \"Captain.\"\n \"Initiate,\" Zai responded and turned to Bassiritz.\n \"She actually said something to you, Private?\" he asked.\n \"Yes, sir. Asked for you, sir.\"\n Hobbes looked at the prisoner through the false transparency of the hypercarbon. The commando sat in one corner, as dirty and forlorn as some forgotten madwoman in an asylum. She hadn\u0027t spoken in her months of captivity--only those nine words when she\u0027d been captured, a lament for her dead lover. Why would she wait until now to reveal a message?\n \"Can we two-way this transparency?\" Captain Zai asked.\n \"No, sir. There\u0027s no hardscreen inside.\"\n \"Then let\u0027s go in.\"\n \"Sir!\" Hobbes protested. \"That\u0027s a Rix commando, restrained or not.\"\n \"She appears to be wearing a shock collar. Private, you have the remote?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\" Bassiritz held the little hardkey up.\n \"Keep it handy.\"\n \"Captain,\" interjected the initiate. \"I will take the remote, if you please.\"\n \"Initiate Farre,\" Zai said, \"this man\u0027s reflexes are far quicker than yours. You\u0027ll put our safety at risk.\"\n \"The Emperor is concerned about secrets supplied to the prisoner \u003e68 by the compound mind on Legis,\" the initiate said. \"Is this cell secured?\"\n Zai glanced at Hobbes.\n \"The cell has no particular data security, sir. But it\u0027s pretty blind in there. No camwall or synesthesia projectors. And she\u0027s hardly been spilling secrets.\"\n \"Ma\u0027am,\" Bassiritz offered nervously. \"There\u0027s an extra remote, for watch changes.\"\n They would only be safer with two remotes, Hobbes realized. She nodded, and the marine produced another of the black hardkeys. He handed it to Farre.\n Zai gestured, but the door failed to open. Hobbes recalled that it was purely mechanical, cut off from automatics and even decompression safeties. She nodded to the ranking marine, who ordered two of the fire team to muscle it open. Chain of command in action, Hobbes thought.\n Bassiritz went through first.\n Captain Zai waited for a moment, watching for the commando\u0027s reaction. The Rixwoman stood, but kept to her corner. Hobbes saw now that her movements were strangely disjointed, as sudden as a nervous bird\u0027s.\n \"Executive Officer,\" Zai said.\n Hobbes\u0027s finger brushed the reassuring bump of her concealed flechette pistol before stepping through the meter-wide door. The room was bright, lit by a ceiling full of dumb, spray-on filaments. It smelled of confinement, but without overwhelming rankness. The Rixwoman\u0027s sweat had the scent of milk about to turn.\n Zai and the initiate came after her. The four of them remained in the opposite corner from the Rixwoman. Her eyes shone violet in the harsh light, her face as still as some ancient lizard\u0027s.\n \"Captain Laurent Zai,\" she said. Hobbes recognized in her accent the long vowels of Legis XV\u0027s far northern provinces.\n \"Yes. And your name?\" Zai answered.\n It had never occurred to Hobbes that she would have one.\n \"Herd.\" Her accent slipped into some native phonology, and the vowel was inflected by a zuzz at the back of the woman\u0027s throat.\n \"And you have a message for me?\"\n \"From Alexander.\"\n Good god, thought Hobbes. The compound mind had a name.\n Zai just nodded. \"What is it?\"\n The commando cocked her head, as if listening to something. Then shifted inside the straightjacket, rolling her shoulders.\n \"Alexander wishes to give you a weapon.\"\n \"A weapon?\" Zai asked, finally unable to keep surprise from his voice. \"Technology?\"\n \"No, Captain. Information,\" she said. \"To use against the Emperor.\"\n Farre raised the shock remote.\n \"You see, Captain? She has classified information.\"\n Zai was silent for a moment, stunned by the Rixwoman\u0027s words. Hobbes glanced toward Private Bassiritz. The commando might be trying to create a moment of confusion before launching an attack, and the old initiate would never react quickly enough to stop her. The marine seemed completely alert, however; he was shutting out the words. His eyes were fixed on the commando fiercely, as if she were some childhood monster come to life. Hobbes swallowed, and again touched the shape of her flechette pistol through the wool of her sleeve.\n \"I am the Emperor\u0027s servant,\" Zai said.\n \"He is afraid of us, and he will destroy us if he can,\" the Rix-woman said.\n \"Us?\" Zai asked. \"You and ... ?\"\n \"The Lynx and Alexander. Us. We are bound together now.\"\n Captain Zai placed his palms together. \"The Emperor knows no fear,\" he began the catechism. \"Not even death--\"\n \"A lie,\" Herd said quietly.\n Farre made a noise, as if she\u0027d been struck with something.\n \"Silence,\" the initiate cried. \"Captain, you must secure this room. Immediately.\"\n The captain glared at the prisoner. Hobbes thought for a moment that Zai would turn and leave the madwoman in her lonely cell. However much the past months had changed him, Zai was still appalled by her blasphemy.\n But instead he took a deep breath.\n \"Of what is the Emperor afraid?\" Laurent Zai asked, his jaw clenched with the effort of the calumnious words.\n \"He has a secret,\" Herd said, \"which Alexander discovered on Legis. If this information became known, it would destroy his power.\"\n \"Silence!\" the initiate shrieked, again flinching as if the words were dealing her physical blows. Both her hands clenched around the remote.\n The Rixwoman\u0027s form jerked horribly to attention within the straightjacket. She toppled against the wall and slid down to the floor, her body as stiff as a statue, her face frozen in a terrible rictus.\n \"Listen, Zai,\" she hissed, her accent becoming flat and Rixian. \"The dead are--\"\n Then the collar overwhelmed the Rixwoman, her body thrashing like a corpse animated with electrical shocks. \"Private,\" the captain said quietly.\n Bassiritz adjusted his own remote, and the shock collar released the commando. Initiate Farre dropped to her knees, holding her head and shaking as if she\u0027d been shocked as well.\n Hobbes ignored the initiate and took a few steps toward the prisoner. She knelt, still a meter away, and looked into the commando\u0027s now slack face.\n Saliva bubbled from her lips. She was breathing, at least. Hobbes glared back at Farre.\n \"Silence,\" the political insisted again, her voice reduced to a mewling cry.\n Bassiritz gazed on the proceedings with a strange, horrified expression. Yet the marine looked strangely pleased, as if he\u0027d just squashed some large and repellent insect.\n \"Cut the audio feed from this room,\" Zai said to the wall. \"No more contact with this prisoner.\"\n \"Sir?\" Hobbes asked.\n \"She may indeed know Imperial secrets, Hobbes. It\u0027s up to us to guard them.\"\n Hobbes reached out a hand, and touched the woman\u0027s neck. She felt for a pulse.\n \"They have no hearts, Hobbes,\" Zai said. \"Not the beating kind, anyway.\"\n The executive officer nodded. The skin was room temperature; she remembered that Rix commandos were generally cold-blooded to prevent thermal imaging.\n What a compromised human being.\n \"Come away from there,\" Zai ordered softly.\n Hobbes stood, and retreated.\n The Rixwoman moved, turning her head slowly.\n \"Wait,\" she croaked.\n \"For god\u0027s sake, silence, woman!\" Zai pleaded.\n Herd shook her head. \"No secrets. Just a question.\"\n Captain Zai looked at Hobbes, lost for a moment. The initiate lay on the ground, head in hands and beyond hearing, but Bassiritz stood ready with the other remote.\n The executive officer turned to the prisoner, knelt again.\n \"What is it, Herd?\"\n The commando took a few breaths, swallowing, as if to wet her mouth. When she spoke, the words were tortured.\n \"Is it true that Rana Harter is alive again?\" she said.\n The woman seemed confused, as if she were speaking her own mind after a lifetime of prompting. Her words were halting.\n \"I must see . . . Rana Harter,\" she said.\n Zai shook his head. \"The Honored Sister is not to be disturbed. Not by anyone.\"\n The prisoner nodded. \"But she is alive.\"\n Hobbes felt a strange sympathy for the Rixwoman. But the captain had no choice; the Emperor\u0027s orders were explicit. Not even the other honored dead were allowed to speak with Rana Harter. An adept of the Apparatus, the ranking political aboard the Lynx, was posted in her antechamber.\n \"He\u0027ll kill her,\" Herd said.\n \"Who will?\" Hobbes asked.\n \"The Emperor,\" the woman said softly. \"Your Emperor fears that she knows his secret. But she doesn\u0027t.\"\n \"Rixwoman,\" Zai said. \"Don\u0027t speak of secrets.\"\n \"Let me see her,\" the woman pleaded, trying to rise from where she lay. But the attempt exhausted her, and her head dropped back to the floor.\n \"My orders are clear,\" Zai said. \"Rana Harter is to be left alone.\"\n He turned away from the prisoner and pulled himself through the door. Hobbes stared at the alien woman for a moment, looking for the signs of truth she might find in a normal human\u0027s eyes. But the commando\u0027s face had hardened again. Once more she seemed to come from some nonmammalian order, as inscrutable as a tortoise.\n Hobbes signaled to Bassiritz to help the initiate out of the cell. What had affected the political like that? She knew that calumny against the Emperor was painful to the most heavily conditioned members of the Apparatus, even to lifelong grays like her Vadan captain, but she\u0027d never seen anyone brought to their knees by mere words.\n Hobbes followed Zai, wondering what to do. The room was sealed behind them, and the wall went blank, as impenetrable as stone.\n As they strode toward the bridge, Zai said, \"Rana Harter.\"\n \"Sir?\"\n \"The order to keep her isolated. I\u0027ve never seen such a command. It is very strange to imprison the honored dead.\"\n Zai\u0027s voice shook as he said it. Hobbes knew that Harter\u0027s reanima-tion was dubious at best, in the eyes of tradition. The politicals occasionally used the symbiant for tactical reasons, to interrogate a traitor or reverse a local assassination that threatened stability, but the official fiction was that all the dead were honored. So it must wound Zai\u0027s Vadan soul to restrain a risen woman.\n \"Perhaps there are secrets that we\u0027re not meant to know, eh, Hobbes?\"\n \"Almost certainly, sir,\" she answered.\n He stopped short, turned to her.\n \"Do you think we need a weapon against the Emperor, Hobbes?\"\n She knew that anything short of swift denial was treasonous, but she couldn\u0027t bring herself to lie.\n \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" She half-closed her eyes, her face tense as if awaiting a blow from an angry parent\u0027s hand.\n But Captain Zai said, \"I don\u0027t either, Hobbes. I don\u0027t either.\" He turned away again, and they went up to the bridge.\n Senator\n The garden had changed.\n Arciform sand dunes still dominated the walk to its center, but the scorpions had been replaced with desert flowers. The many fountains still played their tricks of orientation, lovely gravity wells bending the water through playfully twisted paths, but the liquid was now phosphorescent, the drops sparkling like the last glimmers from a firework display. The sinuous and threatening vines Nara Oxham remembered lining the walk had been done away with. Ranks of tulips framed the spiraling path now. Purple and black, their petals were variegated with red lines caused--she remembered--by a virus.\n They were quite beautiful, though.\n Senator Oxham wondered if these changes to the Emperor\u0027s garden were part of some weekly redecoration, or if the lighthearted touches were a response to war, a curative for the sovereign\u0027s cares. The short journey through the garden certainly seemed less threatening now.\n Oxham shook her head, realizing that her own assurance had nothing to do with the flowers or sparkling waters. She was simply no longer intimidated by the Imperial mystique.\n The dead man waited for her at the center.\n \"Counselor,\" he greeted her.\n \"Good day, Sire.\"\n \"Please be seated, Senator Oxham.\"\n Oxham sat in the floating chair. It seemed to remember her, adapting to her shape more quickly than it had the first time she\u0027d come to the Diamond Palace.\n It was strange to meet the sovereign again outside the presence of the War Council. The precisely balanced tensions of that group had become so familiar, their range of emotional reactions so predictable. Oxham felt a sense of dislocation. Perhaps that was why the Emperor had reconfigured his garden, to put her subtly ill at ease.\n A cat leaped into her lap, startling her. The creature was the color of gray ash, with an apricot-colored mask and white paws. Oxham ran her hand along its back, feeling with quiet distaste the ridges of the symbiant.\n \"Does it have a name, Sire?\" she asked.\n \"Alexander.\"\n \"He seeks new worlds to conquer, then.\"\n The Emperor smiled wanly. \"Perhaps.\" She could see the emotions in the dead man clearly. Anxiety, tempered with the confidence of a well-laid plan. Oxham had set her apathy bracelet perilously low, but here, shut off from the raging city, her sensitivity was bright. She remembered Roger Niles\u0027s warnings, and determined that she would make no mistakes today.\n \"To what do I owe this honor, Your Majesty?\"\n The sovereign reached under his chair. He produced a small human skull, turned so that its eye sockets stared at her.\n Oxham stiffened slightly, and the little beast on her lap betrayed her reaction with wide-eyed annoyance at the motion.\n \"Forgive me, Senator,\" the sovereign apologized.\n \"I am your servant, Majesty.\" Oxham stealthily jabbed the cat with a fingernail, but it simply purred.\n She regarded the skull. At first, it seemed to be that of a child, but the cheekbones jutted ahead of the brow, and the teeth were arrayed in an uncorrected, pretechnology jumble. Along with the sloping forehead, these characteristics suggested the diminutive skull of an ancient hominid adult.\n \"Another history lesson, Sire?\"\n \"An illustrative example, Senator.\" He rotated the skull in his hand, tipped it to face him as if he were going to play Hamlet. Now its top was to Oxham, and she saw the holes.\n There were four of them in a rectangle, each a few centimeters across, the two closer to the front much larger. Old cracks emanated from the holes. Only a sealant of gleaming transparent plastic kept the skull from crumbling in the Emperor\u0027s hand.\n Nara swallowed. This example might be a grim one.\n \"Some ancient form of execution, Sire?\"\n He shook his head. Another cat appeared from among the tulips and wound between the legs of her chair, then disappeared.\n \"Just an old story, for those who can read it.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid I cannot, Liege.\"\n \"This creature, one of our honored ancestors, lived on the African continent of Earth Prime.\" \"In Egypt?\"\n \"Farther south,\" he corrected. \"Before there were nations. At the edge of humanity\u0027s existence, when tools were first emerging.\"\n Oxham nodded. This skull was old indeed. What a long, strange journey it had taken, to wind up here in this dead man\u0027s hand.\n \"They lived in darkness, without language or fire. No agriculture, of course. Her people had no rudiments of civilization. They had no writing or spoken language.\"\n \"What did they eat, Sire?\"\n \"Wild plants, from the ground. Distasteful.\"\n \"I\u0027ve eaten wild plants, Sire.\"\n \"Vasthold has a primeval charm.\"\n \"It did when I left it.\"\n The sovereign turned the skull to face her. \"She and her people lived in lava funnel caves, massive and deep, extensive enough to support their own food web. Our ancestors had a stable and protected niche. We would be there still if they hadn\u0027t been driven outward into the sun.\"\n Oxham\u0027s eyes narrowed as she looked at the holes again.\n \"The teeth of a predator, Your Majesty?\"\n \"Dinofelis. Extinct long before the diaspora.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-killing-of-worlds-succession-2/page-20.html","bookId":1753,"book":{"id":1753,"title":"The Killing of Worlds (Succession #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Killing of Worlds (Succession #2) \n The immortal Emperor can grant a form of eternal life-after-death, creating an elite known as the Risen, and so has ruled the eighty worlds unchallenged for sixteen hundred years.
