{"id":71609,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Nothing happened yet. In theory, the captain\u0027s gesture was not the trigger that killed the prisoners. No one person did the Emperor\u0027s work in this regard, but the universe itself. Zai had commanded the Lynx to watch for a certain occultation, an astronomical event that would inevitably occur within a few minutes. When the Lynx made the observation--a star of a specific class disappearing behind some random asteroid in the Legis belt--the executions would unfold.\\n\\n They waited.\\n\\n A timeless minute later it must have happened, a tiny and momentary blackness amid the river of light on which the Lynx moved, a drifting closed of some sleepy god\u0027s eye.\\n\\n Gravity inverted in the other half of the room, the prisoners suddenly levitating before Hobbes\u0027s eyes. The bonds around their ankles snapped taught, like a fall halted by a noose, their vorpal shunts opening as one. Four thin streams of blood shot toward the ceiling-- the floor in their frame of reference--striking the ceremonial platters with a sound like piss hitting a metal bowl.\\n\\n The prisoners didn\u0027t struggle. Supposedly, this form of execution was relatively painless, the limbs growing quickly cold. Oxygen would cease to reach the body\u0027s cells, but like suffocation by carbon dioxide, there would be no frenzied gasping for breath.\\n\\n Their faces grew pink at first, as the inverted gravity brought blood down from the feet to the head. But Katherie could see the mutineers\u0027 bound hands turning white already. Eventually, their faces would blanch and grow expressionless. Blood pooled in the ceremonial bowls, the metal-ringing, splattery sound replaced by the gurgle of liquid into liquid.\\n\\n Katherie stood at attention. She felt light-headed, as if the gravity inversion were losing integrity, suffusing across the yellow-red stripe, its tendrils finding her. She blinked, and nausea rose in Hobbes. Her old nemesis vertigo threatened as her eyes read the clear signs of up and down reversed on the other side of the room, a few wisps of Magus\u0027s hair flailing upward, the lines of Thompson\u0027s face pulled wrong.\\n\\n Then the flow of blood began to slacken. The prisoners\u0027 faces grew white. It was almost over.\\n\\n And then something terrible happened.\\n\\n The four hanging bodies suddenly jolted toward her, as if kicked from behind. She and Zai jumped back. Magus\u0027s hair pointed directly at Hobbes now. Gravity inside the inversion zone had shifted by ninety degrees, a malfunction of the Lynx\u0027s ailing generator.\\n\\n Hobbes looked at the ceiling with horror.\\n\\n The blood already collected in the ceremonial bowls was spilling out, pouring across the ceiling in a sanguine waterfall, rolling toward the yellow-red stripe almost above her head.\\n\\n Katherie barely had time to cover her face.\\n\\n The liters of blood reached the normal gravity zone, a red river that was cleaved by the sudden directional shift. It sprayed upon her and Laurent Zai like a warm summer rain.\\n\\n Katherie Hobbes awoke gasping, clawing at the strands of her own hair in her mouth.\\n\\n A dream. Just a dream. The executions had been more than a month ago. Nothing so horrible had happened. In the real event, the ritual had unfolded with admirable military precision.\\n\\n Hobbes coughed, wiping sweat from her face, which tasted as salty as blood. She pulled her knees to her chest and breathed deeply, trying to calm herself.\\n\\n Then she realized it: This had been her first real dream in months.\\n\\n Katherie Hobbes had just gone back to natural sleep, her usage of hypersleep having exceeded the recommended maximum by more than a hundred percent. The ship\u0027s new doctor, an earnest civilian from Legis\u0027s storm-swept equatorial archipelago, had given her drugs to help the transition. But Katherie had left them untouched, relying on exhaustion to get her to oblivion.\\n\\n Clearly, that had been a bad idea. Hobbes had grown addicted to 257 the instantaneous drop into hyperdreams, the familiar, symbolic process-narratives that reliably reconstituted her brain. Falling into natural sleep had taken a thrashing, anxious hour. And when Katherie Hobbes finally slipped into a restless unconsciousness, it was only to discover this long-suppressed nightmare.\\n\\n A moment after she awoke from the execution dream, the entry chime sounded from Hobbes\u0027s door, an insistent summons dragging her fully awake. The access icon glowed in second sight: an Apparatus subpoena in brilliant red.\\n\\n Without waiting for a response, three politicals entered her cabin. Two honored dead and a living woman.\\n\\n \"Katherie Hobbes.\" Even in the dark cabin, Hobbes recognized the flat voice of Adept Harper Trevim.\\n\\n This was serious, Katherie\u0027s addled brain slowly realized. Trevim was the ranking political on board the Lynx. What had happened? Hobbes sat up, and quickly ran the frigate\u0027s top-level diagnostics in synesthesia. Nothing seemed out of place.\\n\\n \"Yes, Honored Mother?\" she managed with a dry voice.\\n\\n \"We must talk with you.\"\\n\\n She nodded and rose shakily to attention. In an odd moment of embarrassment, she hoped the politicals wouldn\u0027t notice her bedclothes. The natural worm silk of her sheets was a guilty pleasure from home. Hobbes kept it covered with a blanket of Navy wool during the day. The politicals looked only at her body, however, a bit of discomfort showing on the living woman\u0027s face. Having grown up on a Utopian world, Hobbes felt no discomfort in nakedness. The dead, she assumed, were similarly unflappable.\\n\\n \"Yes, Adept. At the Emperor\u0027s pleasure,\" she answered.\\n\\n \"We must speak of your captain.\"\\n\\n Of course. They were still after Laurent. They always would be.\\n\\n \"Yes, Honored Mother?\"\\n\\n \"New information has come to us about his rejection of the blade.\" Hobbes could barely hide her disgust. She spoke rudely. \"He was pardoned by the Emperor, Adept.\"\\n\\n The dead woman nodded. The precise, expressionless movement reminded Hobbes of her protocol instructor when she\u0027d been a staff officer. She\u0027d learned the gestural cues of a dozen cultures from the man, but he had never seemed fully human himself. The adept had the same neutral presence, as if this were all some strange ritual. Indeed, the whole scene was so surreal, Hobbes wasn\u0027t sure she wasn\u0027t still dreaming.\\n\\n \"Yes, it was fortunate that he did not take the blade before pardon was given,\" Trevim said. \"But we are concerned about his motivation for delaying the ritual.\"\\n\\n Hobbes couldn\u0027t see where this was going. She blinked, trying to will away the cobwebs of sleep in her mind. \"Honored Mother?\"\\n\\n \"What is the exact nature of your relationship with Laurent Zai?\"\\n\\n For a moment, Katherie could not answer. Her silence stretched and redoubled itself, until it was a hand over her mouth.\\n\\n She finally forced herself to speak. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"We have heard troubling rumors.\"\\n\\n Hobbes felt the flush at her breast, the heat in her face. She was angry, humiliated, enraged at her own inability to respond. This had to be another nightmare: naked, her head groggy with sleep, called on the carpet by the Emperor\u0027s representatives.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean, Adept.\"\\n\\n \"What is your exact relationship with Laurent Zai?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m his executive officer.\"\\n\\n \"Is there anything more?\"\\n\\n Hobbes willfully forced emotion from her mind, and let herself be ruled by the dictates of gray talk, as if she were making a military report. She only had to tell the truth. Anything else between them had only ever been in her own mind. \"I have the utmost respect for the captain. There is nothing unprofessional in our friendship.\"\\n\\n \"Friendship?\"\\n\\n \"Friendship.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know why he rejected the blade?\" \"I don\u0027t--\" Hobbes choked herself off. She did know, she realized. \"There is no reason for Captain Zai to die. And he was pardoned.\"\\n\\n \"Was it because of his affair with you?\"\\n\\n \"There is nothing between Laurent and me,\" she said. Somehow, it seemed harder to tell the truth than it would have been to lie.\\n\\n \"Laurent?\" the adept noted.\\n\\n Hobbes took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She felt the heat of another blush travel across her exposed body. Hobbes realized that if they were polygraphing her, they had every advantage. She was naked and exhausted, without defenses.\\n\\n But she was telling the truth, after all.\\n\\n \"Were you and Zai lovers?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Did Laurent Zai choose to live for you, Katherie?\"\\n\\n \"No, Adept. It was someone else.\"\\n\\n Their faces showed no surprise, but Hobbes\u0027s words won her a moment of respite. She felt triumphant to have silenced the dead woman.\\n\\n \"Who, Katherie?\" the adept finally asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Another crew member?\"\\n\\n \"No. Captain Zai would never--\" She swallowed. \"I have no idea who.\"\\n\\n \"So it could be a crewmate of yours.\"\\n\\n \"No! It\u0027s someone on Home, I think.\"\\n\\n The adept leaned closer, peering at her like some troubling specimen under glass.\\n\\n \"He just wanted to live, Honored Mother. For some lover, for some imagined future. Why is that so hard to believe?\"\\n\\n The dead woman blinked, then nodded again, as smoothly as a machine. Hobbes felt she could detect an expression on her face: a ghost of satisfaction. \"I believe you, Executive Officer,\" the dead woman said.\\n\\n They left Hobbes, and she curled back into bed. The worm silk didn\u0027t comfort her. The privacy of the cabin had been utterly violated, her mind stripped of its deepest secret. They had seen what she had wanted, what she had allowed herself to hope for. That old humiliation had returned, amplified by a dead woman\u0027s smirk.\\n\\n And as she calmed herself, curling into a ball and gesturing for the susurrant music of her childhood, Katherie realized that she might have made a terrible mistake. The politicals still wanted Captain Zai\u0027s blood, still sought revenge for his rejection of tradition. They would try to turn anything they knew about him to their advantage. And she had told him of his secret lover on Home. Had she betrayed her captain?\\n\\n Marine Private\\n\\n Bassiritz watched the transformation.\\n\\n The prisoner had lain with her head pressed against the cell wall, just as she had for a few minutes of every hour for the last two weeks.\\n\\n He had checked the interval against his time stamp many times, and it was always just over an hour. In his shifts guarding the Rix-woman, Bassiritz had never seen the ritual disrupted. Her actions were absolutely regular, as if her mind were empty of everything but numbers, counting ten thousand seconds again and again. She seemed more machine than human.\\n\\n Bassiritz\u0027s fascination with her had led to still more reading, and he knew that Rix bodies were half artificial. Brain, muscles, cellular systems--no aspect of their physiology remained untouched, even in the womb. Of course, Imperial knowledge had for centuries been limited to corpses recovered after battle; live specimens had only been observed in firefights, where the Rixwomen seemed more demonic than mechanical.\\n\\n The woman before him was the Empire\u0027s first captive Rixwoman.\\n\\n For the last two weeks, Bassiritz had keenly observed this event, this moment when the prisoner looked fully human. As she listened, head pressed to the hypercarbon wall, the fierce cast of her features softened, as if she were adrift in some innocent daydream years distant from her empty cell. So he saw when it happened.\\n\\n Her eyes popped open, and filled with predatory pleasure.\\n\\n The marine jumped at the Rixwoman\u0027s sudden motion, a measure of cold fear trickling into his belly. The hypercarbon between them suddenly seemed no more substantial than glass.\\n\\n Bassiritz remembered his childhood, when he used to dare himself to face his father\u0027s tarantula, trapped in a terrarium above the old man\u0027s desk. The arachnid glowered down from the transparent globe, guarding its tiny domain of twigs and sand. The glass sphere never seemed sufficient to ensure its captivity. When, subjective years ago, Bassiritz had returned home to discover that the Time Thief had taken his father, the globe above the desk was empty. The tarantula had died long ago, his aging sisters assured Bassiritz. But in his mind, it had escaped, free to roam now that it was no longer held in check by his father\u0027s iron will. Since that disappearance, the marine had never slept comfortably in his family home.\\n\\n The Rixwoman now seemed to embody the spirit of that missing spider, as if it had come for him at last.\\n\\n She stared directly at Bassiritz, even though the imaging was oneway.\\n\\n \"Bring your captain to me,\" she said.\\n\\n He nodded dumbly, unable to resist her command.\\n\\n Laurent Zai looked at the command bridge airscreen and sighed.\\n\\n The colors of the image were false, the terminology metaphorical, the clean-looking shapes wholly a mathematical invention. The illustration was purely hypothetical; merely a representation of a theory about an enigma. Nothing was ever straightforward when one tried to plumb the quantum.\\n\\n \"We think that the pseudoatoms are physically disjunct from the silicon substrate,\" Tyre continued.\\n\\n Zai\u0027s eyes drifted about the command bridge. He wondered how many of the officers present really understood this. They were all still exhausted by battle and repair work, and perhaps a bit complacent from victory. For the last fifteen minutes, only Hobbes had been questioning the DA ensign.\\n\\n \"The silicon simply gives it mass?\" his executive officer asked.\\n\\n \"Gives it mass, ma\u0027am,\" said Tyre, \"and serves as the semiconducting medium. Without a semiconductor, you can\u0027t make quantum wells.\"\\n\\n Captain Zai winced. There was that term again. He\u0027d always thought of quantum mechanics as safely in the realm of the minuscule--relevant to data processing and communications, but not the hard and \"strongly interacting\" physics of combat. Whenever the twisted rules of the quantum domain reached up into the macroworld, the results were unnerving.\\n\\n \"Please explain quantum wells again, Ensign.\"\\n\\n Tyre took a deep breath, managing to keep frustration from her face.\\n\\n \"In certain semiconducting environments, electrons occupy something called a quantum well. Inside a quantum well, pseudoatom electrons assume the arrangement of a normal atom, but there\u0027s no nucleus--no protons or neutrons.\"\\n\\n \"No real mass, Captain,\" Hobbes added, \"and with infinite half-life: no radiation or decay even in transuranium elements. But like an isotope, quantum-well pseudoatoms have the same physical characteristics as a real atom with the same number of electrons: hardness, reflectivity, chemical properties.\"\\n\\n \"Imperial data processors use quantum wells, correct?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Some do, sir,\" Tyre explained. \"The Lynx\u0027s processors certainly use quantum bits--data are stored in the spin-state of electron pairs in trapped phosphorus atoms--but that\u0027s not a quantum well. Those are real phosphorus atoms.\"\\n\\n Zai sighed.\\n\\n \"But we do know how to create quantum wells,\" he stated.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. That\u0027s pre-starflight technology.\"\\n\\n \"In that case, and please put this simply,\" he said, \"what can the Rix do that we can\u0027t?\"\\n\\n Ensign Tyre looked pleadingly at Hobbes, and the executive officer nodded and looked upward to gather her thoughts.\\n\\n \"Sir, we can only create wells with fixed electron counts, and under relatively controlled circumstances. But the Rix have found a way to add and subtract electrons on the fly, to change the wells\u0027 elemental characteristics at will. Apparently, the object can address its pseudoatoms as if they were registers in a computer\u0027s memory. In some sense, the object is a quantum computer.\"\\n\\n \"A computer that can change itself into whatever it wants?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. The process of the object\u0027s thoughts is transubstantiation.\"\\n\\n \"Mind and matter, one,\" he mused.\\n\\n Hobbes narrowed her eyes. \"I suppose so, sir.\"\\n\\n Laurent Zai dared another look into the airscreen. Since his last question, Ensign Tyre had put up a representation of a quantum well. It looked like any number of three-dimensional graphs: a terrain of spiky mountains arranged with an odd symmetry, like a wedding procession of volcanoes, or the spinal ridges of some exaggerated trilobite.\\n\\n Thoughts of evolutionary past turned over the soil of Zai\u0027s growing disquiet. His staff seemed insufficiently alarmed by the object\u0027s abilities, as if they\u0027d captured some alien and charming children\u0027s toy. Ensign Tyre seemed to view this as an intellectual game, as if it were one of the reverse-engineering conundra that DA officers composed and swapped like chess puzzles. For Hobbes, this new Rix technology translated into nothing more than a set of tactical advantages, like a new form of armor or an improved gravity effect.\\n\\n But Zai saw a greater danger. Not only to the Empire, but to humanity itself. This was a revision of matter, for god\u0027s sake. He had to make them grasp the enormity of this development.\\n\\n \"Tyre,\" he said, \"would this work at higher temperatures?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely, sir. It might improve its operation. Frankly, we have no idea how they\u0027ve managed to get the silicon to semiconduct at deep-space temperatures.\"\\n\\n \"And it would work in a hard-gee field?\"\\n\\n \"It should, sir. We\u0027ve poked at it with easy gravitons, anyway, and there seems to be no disruption. This all happens in the electromagnetic domain; gravity is a relatively trivial force.\"\\n\\n \"So this object could exist on a planet?\"\\n\\n Tyre and Hobbes were silent. Other officers around the table straightened, awakening from the stupor of the physics lesson. Zai waited a few more moments as the idea sank in.\\n\\n Then he asked more directly. \"This object might well adapt itself to terrestrial conditions?\"\\n\\n \"I see no reason why it couldn\u0027t, sir,\" Tyre admitted.\\n\\n \"Could it propagate itself, like nanotechnology?\"\\n\\n \"Possibly, sir. If there was sufficient silicon in the environment.\"\\n\\n \"What percentage of the average terrestrial planet is silicon, Tyre?\"\\n\\n Hobbes shook her head as she interrupted. \"We don\u0027t know if propagation is even remotely possible, sir. And we do know the object has limitations. It can change itself, but it hasn\u0027t turned into a starship and attacked us.\"\\n\\n Tyre spoke. \"It seems to be unable to create complex objects, ma\u0027am, as far as we\u0027ve seen. And, of course, the object has only its own silicon substrate for reaction mass; acceleration would gradually consume it. Without nuclei, of course, it can\u0027t make a fusion drive or nuclear weapons.\"\\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027re right, Tyre,\" Zai said. \"How many megatons of silicon do you think exist on Home?\"\\n\\n \"We can keep it physically distant from any planets, sir,\" Hobbes said.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t bring it within a billion kilometers of Home, orders from the Emperor be damned,\" he stated flatly.\\n\\n The disloyal words brought a look of shock to the officers\u0027 faces. Good, he had their attention. They were going to have to be very careful with this war prize.\\n\\n Tyre spoke up, back with an answer to his previous questions. \"Silicon is universally prevalent, sir. In terrestrial planetary crusts, only oxygen is more plentiful by mass. And in cosmic terms, only a few gases and carbon exceed silicon in abundance.\"\\n\\n Zai was finally satisfied by his staff\u0027s reaction to this information.\\n\\n \"Listen carefully,\" he said. \"We seem to have a tiger by the tail. Emergent minds have existed for a long time. As the Rix Cult insists, they are the natural result of any petabyte-scale data system, just as biological life seems to be the natural result of oxygen, carbon, and a billion years of steady sunlight or geothermal. But however threatening compound minds are, so far they have always depended on humanity for their existence. We formed the substrate for their thoughts.\"\\n\\n Zai looked around the command bridge, catching his officers\u0027 eyes one by one.\\n\\n \"But we are no longer necessary,\" he said slowly.\\n\\n Laurent Zai watched their faces carefully. The trip to Home would take almost two subjective years. To keep his crew alert during that long passage, he needed to illustrate the threat that this enigmatic cargo posed to the Lynx and the Empire, and to humanity. The space-born mind was a new species, an altogether unknown entity that would test this crew sorely.\\n\\n A strange look passed over Hobbes\u0027s face. She put a hand to one ear.\\n\\n \"Sir,\" she said quietly. \"I\u0027m getting double-priority from the Rix prisoner\u0027s marine guard.\"\\n\\n \"An escape attempt?\" Zai asked. He had feared that having a commando on board would cause trouble, no matter how carefully she was guarded.\\n\\n \"Negative, sir. A message.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s decided to speak?\"\\n\\n \"Not her, sir. The message . . . it\u0027s from the compound mind. For you personally.\"\\n\\n Laurent Zai glanced around at the shocked faces of his officers. He didn\u0027t allow himself to show surprise. They would have to learn. Over the next two years, the unexpected would be the norm.\\n\\n \"It has already begun,\" was all he said.\\n\\n He left them there, signaling for Hobbes to follow.\\n\\n Executive Officer\\n\\n As they walked toward the cell, Katherie Hobbes\u0027s hand went to the flechette pistol strapped to her wrist.\\n\\n She had intended to visit the prisoner once her duties permitted. The commando was a fabulous physical specimen, a captive unique in Imperial history. She was the only Rixwoman ever captured alive and conscious by Imperial forces over a century of armed clashes between Empire and Cult.\\n\\n For the Rix, fighting to the end was the rule, suicide the alternative to victory. Hobbes\u0027s researches had found only a single previous example of live Rix prisoners. At the end of the First Incursion, sixteen Rixwomen had been taken while in coldsleep, their long-range small craft intercepted by an Imperial raider deep within Cult space. One by one, they had been awakened, but each died within seconds of consciousness. Imperial doctors had attempted to discover and neutralize the mechanism by which the prisoners had ended their own lives, but no amount of medical intervention could keep them alive. Their bodies rejected sedatives, resuscitation, even--it was rumored--the holy symbiant. It seemed that the Rix had conscious control over their vital functions. For a Rixwoman, breathing was an option, the actions of the heart a voluntary choice.\\n\\n Suicide, simply a decision.\\n\\n Maybe, Hobbes thought, they actually believed their own propaganda. If human life was inherently meaningless, then one\u0027s own might be ended by a whim.\\n\\n Here was a Rixwoman, however, an elite commando of the Cult, who had apparently decided that life in captivity was worth living. But was it her own decision that kept her alive, Hobbes wondered, or the purposes of the comoound mind?\\n\\n The marine guards snapped to attention when the executive officer and Captain Zai reached the cell. Hobbes had sent an extra fire team here when the priority signal came through; there were five marines present in all. One was Private Bassiritz, the man she\u0027d drafted to help foil the mutiny. Hobbes had personally chosen him for this duty. If anyone could react quickly enough to meet a Rix commando on her own terms, Bassiritz could. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-killing-of-worlds-succession-2/page-19.html","bookId":1753,"book":{"id":1753,"title":"The Killing of Worlds (Succession #2)","description":"Storyline: The Killing of Worlds (Succession #2) \\n The immortal Emperor can grant a form of eternal life-after-death, creating an elite known as the Risen, and so has ruled the eighty worlds unchallenged for sixteen hundred years.
