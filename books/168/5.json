{"id":4812,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"\"It isn\u0027t strychnine, is it? \" \"Where did you find this?\" I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity. \"In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\" \"Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s. But what does it mean?\" Poirot shrugged his shoulders. \"I cannot say--but it is suggestive.\" A wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s mind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life? I was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words distracted me. \"Come,\" he said, \"now to examine the coffee-cups!\" \"My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know about the coco?\" \"Oh, la la! That miserable coco!\" cried Poirot flippantly. He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste. \"And, anyway,\" I said, with increasing coldness, \"as Mrs. Inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to find, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray!\" Poirot was sobered at once. \"Come, come, my friend,\" he said, slipping his arms through mine. \"Ne vous fachez pas! Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I will respect your coco. There! Is it a bargain?\" He was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained undisturbed as we had left them. Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups. \"So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray--and poured out. Yes. Then she came across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here are the three cups. And the cup on the mantel-piece, half drunk, that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\u0027s. And the one on the tray?\" \"John Cavendish\u0027s. I saw him put it down there.\" \"Good. One, two, three, four, five--but where, then, is the cup of Mr. Inglethorp?\" \"He does not take coffee.\" \"Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\" With infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup, sealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did so. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered there that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved. \"Bien!\" he said at last. \"It is evident! I had an idea--but clearly I was mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no matter!\" And, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot had been a great man in his day. \"Breakfast is ready,\" said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall. \"You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\" Poirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to his normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset him temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal. He was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his brother, who had, perhaps, too much. Ever since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work, sending telegrams--one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard--writing notices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the melancholy duties that a death entails. \"May I ask how things are proceeding?\" he said. \"Do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death-- or--or must we prepare ourselves for the worst?\" \"I think, Mr. Cavendish,\" said Poirot gravely, \"that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views of the other members of the family?\" \"My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure.\" \"He does, does he? That is very interesting--very interesting,\" murmured Poirot softly. \"And Mrs. Cavendish?\" A faint cloud passed over John\u0027s face. \"I have not the least idea what my wife\u0027s views on the subject are.\" The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort: \"I told you, didn\u0027t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\" Poirot bent his head. \"It\u0027s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him as usual--but, hang it all, one\u0027s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer!\" Poirot nodded sympathetically. \"I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr. Cavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp\u0027s reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had forgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?\" \"Yes.\" \"I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten--that he did not take it after all?\" \"I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the hall drawer. I\u0027ll go and see if it\u0027s there now.\" Poirot held up his hand with a faint smile. \"No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to replace it by now.\" \"But do you think----\" \"I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his favour. That is all.\" John looked perplexed. \"Do not worry,\" said Poirot smoothly. \"I assure you that you need not let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some breakfast.\" Every one was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is always trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really a matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of secretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy. I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that we suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the fact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear, or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man. But did every one suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent, hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all. And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I thought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: \"Yes, I\u0027ve got the most beastly headache.\" \"Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\" said Poirot solicitously. \"It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the mal de tete.\" He jumped up and took her cup. \"No sugar,\" said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the sugar-tongs. \"No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\" \"No, I never take it in coffee.\" \"Sacre!\" murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the replenished cup. Only I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were as green as a cat\u0027s. He had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly--but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense, but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_ attention. In another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared. \"Mr. Wells to see you, sir,\" she said to John. I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs. Inglethorp had written the night before. John rose immediately. \"Show him into my study.\" Then he turned to us. \"My mother\u0027s lawyer,\" he explained. And in a lower voice: \"He is also Coroner--you understand. Perhaps you would like to come with me?\" We acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot: \"There will be an inquest then?\" Poirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that my curiosity was aroused. \"What is it? You are not attending to what I say.\" \"It is true, my friend. I am much worried.\" \"Why?\" \"Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\" \"What? You cannot be serious?\" \"But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not understand. My instinct was right.\" \"What instinct?\" \"The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups. Chut! no more now!\" We followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us. Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the typical lawyer\u0027s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the reason of our presence. \"You will understand, Wells,\" he added, \"that this is all strictly private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind.\" \"Quite so, quite so,\" said Mr. Wells soothingly. \"I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it\u0027s quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor\u0027s certificate.\" \"Yes, I suppose so.\" \"Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\" \"Indeed,\" said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he added rather hesitatingly: \"Shall we have to appear as witnesses--all of us, I mean?\" \"You, of course--and ah--er--Mr.--er--Inglethorp.\" A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner: \"Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of form.\" \"I see.\" A faint expression of relief swept over John\u0027s face. It puzzled me, for I saw no occasion for it. \"If you know of nothing to the contrary,\" pursued Mr. Wells, \"I had thought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor\u0027s report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then that arrangement will suit you?\" \"Perfectly.\" \"I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this most tragic affair.\" \"Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\" interposed Poirot, speaking for the first time since we had entered the room. \"I?\" \"Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should have received the letter this morning.\" \"I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance.\" \"She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\" \"Unfortunately, no.\" \"That is a pity,\" said John. \"A great pity,\" agreed Poirot gravely. There was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes. Finally he turned to the lawyer again. \"Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you--that is, if it is not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s death, who would inherit her money?\" The lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied: \"The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish does not object----\" \"Not at all,\" interpolated John. \"I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her last will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant legacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson, Mr. John Cavendish.\" \"Was not that--pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish--rather unfair to her other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\" \"No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father\u0027s will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother\u0027s death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep up Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\" Poirot nodded thoughtfully. \"I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\" Mr. Wells bowed his head. \"As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null and void.\" \"Hein!\" said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \"Was Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\" \"I do not know. She may have been.\" \"She was,\" said John unexpectedly. \"We were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\" \"Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say \u0027her last will.\u0027 Had Mrs. Inglethorp, then, made several former wills?\" \"On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\" said Mr. Wells imperturbably. \"She was given to changing her mind as to her testamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of her family.\" \"Suppose,\" suggested Poirot, \"that, unknown to you, she had made a new will in favour of some one who was not, in any sense of the word, a member of the family--we will say Miss Howard, for instance--would you be surprised?\" \"Not in the least.\" \"Ah!\" Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions. I drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the question of going through Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s papers. \"Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss Howard?\" I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity. Poirot smiled. \"No.\" \"Then why did you ask?\" \"Hush!\" John Cavendish had turned to Poirot. \"Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my mother\u0027s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself.\" \"Which simplifies matters very much,\" murmured the lawyer. \"As technically, of course, he was entitled----\" He did not finish the sentence. \"We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\" explained John, \"and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important papers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through carefully.\" \"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession.\" \"There _is_ a later will.\" It was Poirot who spoke. \"What?\" John and the lawyer looked at him startled. \"Or, rather,\" pursued my friend imperturbably, \"there _was_ one.\" \"What do you mean--there was one? Where is it now?\" \"Burnt!\" \"Burnt?\" \"Yes. See here.\" He took out the charred fragment we had found in the grate in Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he had found it. \"But possibly this is an old will?\" \"I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon.\" \"What?\" \"Impossible!\" broke simultaneously from both men. Poirot turned to John. \"If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to you.\" \"Oh, of course--but I don\u0027t see----\" Poirot raised his hand. \"Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\" \"Very well.\" He rang the bell. Dorcas answered it in due course. \"Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Dorcas withdrew. We waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his ease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase. The clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the approach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter nodded. \"Come inside, Manning,\" said John, \"I want to speak to you.\" Manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and stood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it very carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and intelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech. \"Manning,\" said John, \"this gentleman will put some questions to you which I want you to answer.\" \"Yes sir,\" mumbled Manning. Poirot stepped forward briskly. Manning\u0027s eye swept over him with a faint contempt. \"You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\" \"Yes, sir, me and Willum.\" \"And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\" \"Yes, sir, she did.\" \"Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\" \"Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like--I don\u0027t know what exactly--she wrote it down for him.\" \"Well?\" \"Well, he did, sir.\" \"And what happened next?\" \"We went on with the begonias, sir.\" \"Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\" \"Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\" \"And then?\" \"She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper--under where she\u0027d signed.\" \"Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?\" asked Poirot sharply. \"No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\" \"And you signed where she told you?\" \"Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.\" \"What did she do with it afterwards?\" \"Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\" \"What time was it when she first called you?\" \"About four, I should say, sir.\" \"Not earlier? Couldn\u0027t it have been about half-past three?\" \"No, I shouldn\u0027t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after four--not before it.\" \"Thank you, Manning, that will do,\" said Poirot pleasantly. The gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed cautiously out of the window. We all looked at each other. \"Good heavens!\" murmured John. \"What an extraordinary coincidence.\" \"How--a coincidence?\" \"That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\" Mr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily: \"Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with--some one yesterday afternoon----\" \"What do you mean?\" cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice, and he had gone very pale. \"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never know. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she would have consulted me on the subject--but she had no chance. The will disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish, I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.\" \"Suggestive, or not,\" interrupted John, \"we are most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what first led you to suspect the fact?\" Poirot smiled and answered: \"A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\" John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the window as it swept past. \"Evie!\" cried John. \"Excuse me, Wells.\" He went hurriedly out into the hall. Poirot looked inquiringly at me. \"Miss Howard,\" I explained. \"Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart too, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\" I followed John\u0027s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon, and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would the man have feared her watchful eyes? I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful; that she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness. \"Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired car. Quickest way to get here.\" \"Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\" asked John. \"No.\" \"I thought not. Come along, breakfast\u0027s not cleared away yet, and they\u0027ll make you some fresh tea.\" He turned to me. \"Look after her, Hastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here\u0027s Monsieur Poirot. He\u0027s helping us, you know, Evie.\" Miss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her shoulder at John. \"What do you mean--helping us?\" \"Helping us to investigate.\" \"Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\" \"Taken who to prison?\" \"Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\" \"My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure.\" \"More fool, Lawrence!\" retorted Miss Howard. \"Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily--as I always told you he would.\" \"My dear Evie, don\u0027t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is better to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn\u0027t until Friday.\" \"Not until fiddlesticks!\" The snort Miss Howard gave was truly magnificent. \"You\u0027re all off your heads. The man will be out of the country by then. If he\u0027s any sense, he won\u0027t stay here tamely and wait to be hanged.\" John Cavendish looked at her helplessly. \"I know what it is,\" she accused him, \"you\u0027ve been listening to the doctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all--or just enough to make them dangerous. I ought to know--my own father was a doctor. That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever seen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he\u0027d murder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he\u0027s done it. And all you can do is to murmur silly things about \u0027heart seizure\u0027 and \u0027inquest on Friday.\u0027 You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" asked John, unable to help a faint smile. \"Dash it all, Evie, I can\u0027t haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck.\" \"Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He\u0027s a crafty beggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask Cook if she\u0027s missed any.\" It occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace between them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy John. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought refuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately. Dorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over from the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss Howard. \"Mademoiselle,\" he said gravely, \"I want to ask you something.\" \"Ask away,\" said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour. \"I want to be able to count upon your help.\" \"I\u0027ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\" she replied gruffly. \"Hanging\u0027s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in good old times.\" \"We are at one then,\" said Poirot, \"for I, too, want to hang the criminal.\" \"Alfred Inglethorp?\" \"Him, or another.\" \"No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came along. I don\u0027t say she wasn\u0027t surrounded by sharks--she was. But it was only her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along comes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp--and within two months--hey presto!\" \"Believe me, Miss Howard,\" said Poirot very earnestly, \"if Mr. Inglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will hang him as high as Haman!\" \"That\u0027s better,\" said Miss Howard more enthusiastically. \"But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to me. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours are the only eyes that have wept.\" Miss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her voice. \"If you mean that I was fond of her--yes, I was. You know, Emily was a selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for them--and, that way she missed love. Don\u0027t think she ever realized it, though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different footing. I took my stand from the first. \u0027So many pounds a year I\u0027m worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides--not a pair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.\u0027 She didn\u0027t understand--was very offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn\u0027t that--but I couldn\u0027t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the whole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion go for nothing.\" Poirot nodded sympathetically. \"I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most natural. You think that we are lukewarm--that we lack fire and energy--but trust me, it is not so.\" John stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up to Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking through the desk in the boudoir. As we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and lowered his voice confidentially: \"Look here, what\u0027s going to happen when these two meet?\" I shook my head helplessly. \"I\u0027ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\" \"Will she be able to do so?\" \"The Lord only knows. There\u0027s one thing, Inglethorp himself won\u0027t be too keen on meeting her.\" \"You\u0027ve got the keys still, haven\u0027t you, Poirot?\" I asked, as we reached the door of the locked room. Taking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in. The lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him. \"My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I believe,\" he said. Poirot drew out the small bunch of keys. \"Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\" \"But it\u0027s not locked now.\" \"Impossible!\" \"See.\" And John lifted the lid as he spoke. \"Milles tonnerres!\" cried Poirot, dumfounded. \"And I--who have both the keys in my pocket!\" He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he stiffened. \"En voila une affaire! This lock has been forced.\" \"What?\" Poirot laid down the case again. \"But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\" These exclamations burst from us disjointedly. Poirot answered them categorically--almost mechanically. \"Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was here an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary lock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\" We stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the mantel-piece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on the mantel-piece, were shaking violently. \"See here, it was like this,\" he said at last. \"There was something in that case--some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk, of coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it, thus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have been something of great importance.\" \"But what was it?\" \"Ah!\" cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \"That, I do not know! A document of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper Dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I--\" his anger burst forth freely--\"miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have behaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I should have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is gone. It is destroyed--but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance--we must leave no stone unturned--\" He rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I had sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the top of the stairs, he was out of sight. Mary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared. \"What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings? He has just rushed past me like a mad bull.\" \"He\u0027s rather upset about something,\" I remarked feebly. I really did not know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint smile gather on Mrs. Cavendish\u0027s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try and turn the conversation by saying: \"They haven\u0027t met yet, have they?\" \"Who?\" \"Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\" She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner. \"Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\" \"Well, don\u0027t you?\" I said, rather taken aback. \"No.\" She was smiling in her quiet way. \"I should like to see a good flare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so much, and saying so little.\" \"John doesn\u0027t think so,\" I remarked. \"He\u0027s anxious to keep them apart.\" \"Oh, John!\" Something in her tone fired me, and I blurted out: \"Old John\u0027s an awfully good sort.\" She studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my great surprise: \"You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.\" \"Aren\u0027t you my friend too?\" \"I am a very bad friend.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget all about them the next.\" I don\u0027t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly and not in the best of taste: \"Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\" Instantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs, whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her. I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one, doubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I stepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost immediately. I drew him aside. \"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"is this wise? Surely you don\u0027t want the whole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into the criminal\u0027s hands.\" \"You think so, Hastings?\" \"I am sure of it.\" \"Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\" \"Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\" \"Sure.\" He looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I still thought my rebuke a just and wise one. \"Well,\" he said at last, \"let us go, mon ami.\" \"You have finished here?\" \"For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\" \"Willingly.\" He picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open window in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and Poirot stood aside to let her pass. \"Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\" \"Yes?\" she turned inquiringly. \"Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s medicines?\" A slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly: \"No.\" \"Only her powders?\" The flush deepened as Cynthia replied: \"Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\" \"These?\" Poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders. She nodded. \"Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\" \"No, they were bromide powders.\" \"Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\" As we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than once. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his eyes turned green like a cat\u0027s. They were shining like emeralds now. \"My friend,\" he broke out at last, \"I have a little idea, a very strange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet--it fits in.\" I shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth was only too plain and apparent. \"So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\" I remarked. \"Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it myself.\" Poirot did not appear to be listening to me. \"They have made one more discovery, la-bas,\" he observed, jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \"Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs.\" \"What was it?\" \"Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs. Inglethorp\u0027s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred Inglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged. It came quite as a surprise to Wells--and to John Cavendish also. It was written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the servants--not Dorcas.\" \"Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\" \"He says not.\" \"One might take that with a grain of salt,\" I remarked sceptically. \"All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?\" Poirot smiled. \"Mon ami, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\" \"Yes, often. I suppose every one has.\" \"Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to see if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You will notice that the word \u0027possessed\u0027 is spelt first with one \u0027s\u0027 and subsequently with two--correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it in a sentence, thus: \u0027I am possessed.\u0027 Now, what did that tell me? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \u0027possessed\u0027 that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will--(a document almost certain to contain that word)--occurred to me at once. This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit. \"I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they had been planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly both of the gardeners--for there were two sets of footprints in the bed--had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window, and they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right in my supposition.\" \"That was very ingenious,\" I could not help admitting. \"I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous.\" He smiled. \"You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.\" \"Another point--how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had been lost?\" \"I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\" Poirot looked at me curiously. \"You are very sure of his guilt?\" \"Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly.\" \"On the contrary,\" said Poirot quietly, \"there are several points in his favour.\" \"Oh, come now!\" \"Yes.\" \"I see only one.\" \"And that?\" \"That he was not in the house last night.\" \" \u0027Bad shot!\u0027 as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him.\" \"How is that?\" \"Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last night, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence.\" \"And that reason?\" I asked sceptically. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. \"How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp, I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel--but that does not of necessity make him a murderer.\" I shook my head, unconvinced. \"We do not agree, eh?\" said Poirot. \"Well, let us leave it. Time will show which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the case. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside?\" \"Well----\" I considered. \"One must look at it logically.\" \"True.\" \"I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted--our own eyes have told us that--yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and the destruction of the will, prove that during the night some one entered the room. You agree so far?\" \"Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\" \"Well,\" I said, encouraged, \"as the person who entered did not do so by the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would naturally open the door to her own husband.\" Poirot shook his head. \"Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room--a most unusual proceeding on her part--she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\" \"But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs. Inglethorp herself?\" \"There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards morning, and bolted it then.\" \"Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?\" \"No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another feature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\" \"I had forgotten that,\" I said thoughtfully. \"That is as enigmatical as ever. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her affair.\" \"Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to do.\" \"It is certainly curious,\" I agreed. \"Still, it is unimportant, and need not be taken into account.\" A groan burst from Poirot. \"What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory--let the theory go.\" \"Well, we shall see,\" I said, nettled. \"Yes, we shall see.\" We had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his own room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary annoyance vanished. Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant. It was going to be a hot day. Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that was extraordinary--a curious mingling of terror and agitation. \"Look, Poirot!\" I said. He leant forward. \"Tiens!\" he said. \"It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist\u0027s shop. He is coming here.\" The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after hesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door. \"A little minute,\" cried Poirot from the window. \"I come.\" Motioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and opened the door. Mr. Mace began at once. \"Oh, Mr. Poirot, I\u0027m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that you\u0027d just come back from the Hall?\" \"Yes, we have.\" The young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously. \"It\u0027s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly. They do say--\" he lowered his voice cautiously--\"that it\u0027s poison?\" Poirot\u0027s face remained quite impassive. \"Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\" \"Yes, exactly--of course----\" The young man hesitated, and then his agitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank his voice to a whisper: \"Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn\u0027t--it isn\u0027t strychnine, is it?\" I hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a non-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door Poirot\u0027s eyes met mine. \"Yes,\" he said, nodding gravely. \"He will have evidence to give at the inquest.\" We went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot stopped me with a gesture of his hand. \"Not now, not now, mon ami. I have need of reflection. My mind is in some disorder--which is not well.\" For about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except for several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh. \"It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and classified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear yet--no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_, Hercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\" \"And what are they?\" \"The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very important.\" \"But it was a glorious day!\" I interrupted. \"Poirot, you\u0027re pulling my leg!\" \"Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not forget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\" \"And the second point?\" I asked. \"The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\" \"Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\" \"I am absolutely serious, my friend.\" \"But this is childish!\" \"No, it is very momentous.\" \"And supposing the Coroner\u0027s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\" \"They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire. Also,\" he added placidly, \"I should not allow it!\" \"_You_ would not allow it?\" \"No.\" I looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and amusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded gently. \"Oh, yes, mon ami, I would do what I say.\" He got up and laid his hand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears came into his eyes. \"In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs. Inglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved--no. But she was very good to us Belgians--I owe her a debt.\" I endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on. \"Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested now--when a word from me could save him!\" “你在哪儿找到这东西的？”我问波洛，感到很奇怪。 “在废纸篓里。你认得这笔迹？” “是的，这是英格里桑太大的笔迹。可是这是什么意思呢？” 波洛耸了耸自己的肩膀。 “我说不出——可是这是有启发的。” 我的脑子里闪过一个荒诞的念头。可能是英格里桑太太神经失常了吧？她是不是由于着了魔而有了某种古怪的念头？如果是这样，那是不是也有可能是她自己结果了自己的生命呢？ 我正想对波洛说出这些推测，可是他的话又把我搞糊涂了。 “喂，”他说，“现在去检查那些咖啡杯吧！” “亲爱的波洛，我们已知道可可的情况了，查那东西究竟有什么用处？” “嗨！那倒霉的可可啊！”波洛轻浮地叫了起来。 他满脸高兴地笑着，伪装绝望地把双手举向天空。我当然不应该这样想，可我认为这种举止也许是最粗俗的了。 “可是，不管怎样，”我说道，语气更加冷淡了，“尽管英格里桑太大自己又把咖啡端到楼上去，可我看你别指望能发现什么了，除非你认为有可能我们会在咖啡托盘里发现一小包士的宁！” 波洛立刻变得严肃了。 “得啦，得啦，我的朋友，”他挽住我的手臂说道，“别生气了！你就允许我对我的咖啡怀发生兴趣吧。我也一定尊重你的可可。好！这下成交了吧？” 他如此风趣幽默，逗得我不得不笑了；于是我们一起走向客厅。咖啡杯和托盘仍象我们离开时那样静静地在那儿摆着。 波洛要我扼要叙述一下前一天晚上的情况，他听得很仔细，还核实了每只杯子的位置。 “这么说，卡文迪什太太站在那茶盘旁边——斟咖啡。嗯。后来，她走到窗口你同辛西娅小姐坐的地方。对了。这儿有三只杯子。壁炉台上那怀喝了一半的，是劳伦斯·卡文迪什先生的。那末茶盘里的一只呢？” “是约翰·卡文迪什的。我看他放在那儿的。” “好。一、二、三、四、五——那末英格里桑先生的杯子呢？” “他没喝咖啡。” “那就全弄清楚了。等一等，朋友。” 他小心翼翼地从每只杯底倒出一、两滴咖啡来，把它们分别封装在试管里，在做着这一切的时候，他还依次地每种都尝了尝。他的面容奇怪地在变化。那儿凝聚了这样一种表情，我只能说它一半是使人迷惑，一半是令人宽慰。 “好了！”他终于说道。“明白了！我原来有一个想法——可是显然我是错了。是的，我完全错了。然而这很奇怪，不过不要紧！” 他以他那独特的架式耸了耸肩膀，消除了不知是什么一直困扰着他的疑虑。打从一开始，我本想就告诉他，他对咖啡这样念念不忘，其结果必然会使他走进死胡同，可是我忍住没有说出口。尽管波洛现在老了，当年他毕竟是一位名人。 “早饭准备好了，”约翰·卡文迪什从过道里走了进来，说道。“你乐意和我们一起吃早饭吗，波洛先生？” 波洛默然同意。我朝约翰看了看。他差不多已经恢复了常态。昨晚上今人震惊的事件曾一度使他心烦意乱，可是他的平静沉着很快就又回复到正常。他是个极为缺少想象力的人，和他的弟弟形成鲜明的对照，而他弟弟，也许是想象力太丰富了。 这天早晨，从一大早开始，约翰就一直忙碌着，发电报——第一封就发给伊夫琳·霍华德——给报纸写讣告，以及通常在办丧事时得做的那些令人感伤的事务。 “我可以问一句吗？事情进行得怎么样？”他说。“你的调查表明，我母亲的去世是自然死亡呢——还是——还是我们必须对最坏的情况得有所准备？” “我认为，卡文迪什先生，”波洛严肃地说，“你最好还是别让你自己产生任何虚假的希望。你能告诉我家里其它成员的看法吗？” “我的弟弟劳伦斯确认我们是在无事自扰。他说一切都表明这完全是由于心力衰竭。” “他是这样看的？那倒很有意思——很有意思，”波洛轻声咕哝着。“那末卡文迪什太太呢？” 约翰的脸上掠过一片薄薄的阴云。 “我一点不知道我妻子对这个问题的看法。” 这一回答接着形成了短暂的僵局。还是约翰打破了这相当尴尬的沉默，他稍微有点费力他说： “英格里桑先生已经回来了。我告诉你了吧？” 波洛低了下头。 “这情况对我们大家来说都是很尴尬的。当然，本来应该象往常那样对待他，——可是，嘿，那怎么成，坐下来和一个有可能是杀人犯一起吃饭，怎能叫人不恶心！” 波洛同情地点点头。 “我非常理解，你们的处境是很为难，卡文迪什先生。我想问一个问题。英格里桑先生昨晚没有回来，我相信是因为他忘了带大门的钥匙。是这样吧？” “是的。” “我想你是完全相信他忘记带大门钥匙了——可是他到底带了没有呢？” “我不知道。我从来没有想到要去看一下。我们总是把那钥匙放在门厅的抽屉里的。我去看看，现在是不是在那儿。” 波洛微笑着举起一只手。 “不，不，卡文迪什先生，现在太晚了。我确信你一定能找到它的。即使英格里桑先生真的带走过，现在他也已经有足够的时间把它放回去了。” “那末你认为——” “我没有任何想法。要是今天早上，在他回来之前，恰巧有人看过，看到它是在那儿，那才是一个对他有利的有价值的论据。如此而已。” 约翰显得茫然不知所措。 “别担忧，”波洛温和地说。“我要让你放心，你没有必要让它来烦扰你。由于你是如此好客，那就让我们去吃点早饭吧。” 所有人都聚集在餐室里。在这种情况下，我们自然不是一次令人愉快的聚会，一次令人震惊的事件以后反应总是难受的，因此我认为我们大家都在忍受着痛苦，但是礼貌和良好的教养告诫说我们的举止应该完全象往常一样。可我仍然没法消除惊讶的心情，如果说这种自制确实是一件极其困难的事的话。没有人眼红泪洒，也没有人暗自悲伤，我感到我的看法没有错，看上去多卡斯是个人方面受这一惨案影响最大的一个人。 我朝阿弗雷德扫了一眼，他多少有点装成是个失去妻子的鳏夫的样子，对于这种虚伪，我感到作呕。我真想知道，他是否了解我们任怀疑他。无疑，由于我们瞒着他，他是没法知道这一事实的。他已预感到有某种可怕的潜藏着的危险吗，还是自信他的罪行不会受到惩罚？空气中这种怀疑的气氛一定会对他提出警告：他已成了一个可疑的人。 可是，是不是所有人都怀疑他呢？卡文迪什太太怎么样？我朝她注视着，她坐在餐桌的头上，庄重，镇静，莫测高深。她上身穿着件光滑的灰色外衣，腕部的白色褶边披落在纤细的双手上，看上去十分美丽动人。然而，只要她愿意，她的脸可以变得象斯芬克斯①一样神秘莫测。她沉默寡言，很少开口，还有一点奇怪的是。我觉得她那品貌的强大力量在支配着我们每一个人。 还有年轻的辛西娅呢？她怀疑么？我感到她看上去疲倦不堪，象是病了。她的样子显得非常消沉，忧伤。我问她是不是觉得病了，她坦率地回答说： “是的。我的头痛极了。” “要不要再喝杯咖啡，小姐？”波洛关心地说。“它能使你恢复精神。用来治头痛，它是独一无二的。”他急忙跳起身来，拿了她的杯子。 “不要糖，”波洛刚拿起方糖钳子，辛西娅就看着他说道。 “不要糖？战争时期戒糖，呃？” “不，我喝咖啡从来不放糖。” “该死！”在把斟满的杯子端回来时，波洛自言自语地低声嘀咕说。 这话只有我听见，我好奇地朝他瞥了一眼，看到他的脸，由于抑制着的激动在抽搐，他的两眼也象猫眼似地发着绿光。想必他已听到或看到什么使他深为激动的东西了——可是那是什么呢？我一向认为自己是不算笨的，但是这次我得承认，没有一点不平常的迹象引起过我的注意。 过了一会，门打开了，出现了多卡斯。 “韦尔斯先生看您来了，先生，”她对约翰说。 我想起了这个名字，这就是头一天晚上英格里桑太太给他写过信的那位律师。 约翰立即站起身来。 “把他带到我的书房里丢。”然后他转向我们。“我母亲的律师，”他解释说。接着又放低了声音：“他也是验尸官——你们知道。你们也许想和我一起去一趟吧？” 我们默认了，于是就跟着他出了房间。约翰在前面大步走着，我趁此机会低声问波洛： “要审讯么？” 波洛心不在焉地点点头。他似乎正在想什么，这一来引起了我的好奇心。 “这是怎么啦？你没有留意我说的。” “确实如此，我的朋友。我很担心。” “为什么？” “因为辛西娅小姐喝咖啡不放糖。” “什么？你不能严肃一点吗？” “我这是最严肃的。嗳！那儿有件事情我不明白。我的直觉是对的。” “什么直觉？” “这直觉使我坚持要检查那些咖啡杯，嘘！现在不谈了！” 我们跟着约翰走进他的书房，他关上了我们身后的门。 韦尔斯先生是位风趣的中年人，两眼敏锐，一张典型的律师嘴巴。约翰为我们俩作了介绍，并说明了我们一起前来的原因。 “你得知道，韦尔斯，”他补充说，“这是严格保密的。我们还是希望将会证明不需要进行任何调查。” “是啊！是啊！”韦尔斯先生安慰说。“我想我们本该使你免受审讯的痛楚和宣扬。可是没有医生的死亡证明，这样做当然是不得已的。” “是呀，我也这样想。” “鲍斯坦是个聪明人。我相信，他是毒物学方面的权威。” “不错，”约翰说，态度显得有点不自然。随后他又相当含糊地补充说：“我们会不会都得出庭作证——我的意思是，我们大家？” “你们，当然——还有——嗯——英格里桑——嗯——先生。” 略微停顿了一下，律师继续安慰悦，“任何一件旁的证据都能轻而易举地证实，这仅仅是形式问题。” “我懂了。” 约翰的脸上掠过一丝宽慰的表情。这使我感到迷惑不解，因为我没看出他所以如此的理由。 “要是你没有相反的意见，”韦尔斯先生继续说，“那我想就在星期五吧。那样就会有充裕的时间给我们研究医生的报告了。我想，是今天晚上验尸吧？” “是的。” “这样安排对你合适么？” “完全合适。” “亲爱的卡文迪什，我不需要告诉你了，听到这一最不幸的事件，我有多么悲痛。” “在搞清这件事方面，你能给我们大力帮助吗，先生？”波洛插嘴说，我们进房间以来，这是他第一次开口。 “我？” “是的。我们听说英格里桑太太昨天晚上给你写过信。今天早上你一定收到这封信了。” “是收到了，可是信上并没有什么消息，它只是封短信，要我今天早上来看她，因为她要和我商量一件十分重要的事情。” “她没有给你暗示这可能是件什么事情吗？” “很遗憾，没有。” “真是遗憾。”约翰说。 “太遗憾了。”波洛认真地表示同意。 大家都沉默了。波洛出神地想了一会。最后又转头朝向律师。 “韦尔斯先生，有件事情我想请教请教你——这是说，要是这不违反你的职业规则的话。英格里桑太太去世了，谁将继承她的财产？”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/303/2934.html","bookId":168,"book":{"id":168,"title":"斯泰尔斯庄园奇案 The Mysterious Affair at Styles","description":"简介： The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a detective novel by Agatha Christie.
