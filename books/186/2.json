And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel. \n [bbe] And Elijah said to Elisha, Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Beth-el. But Elisha said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went down to Beth-el. \n 2:3 [hgb] 住 伯 特 利 的 先 知 门 徒 出 来 见 以 利 沙 ， 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 今 日 要 接 你 的 师 傅 离 开 你 ， 你 知 道 不 知 道 。 他 说 ， 我 知 道 ， 你 们 不 要 作 声 。 \n [kjv] And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. \n [bbe] And at Beth-el the sons of the prophets came out to Elisha and said, Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yes, I have knowledge of it: say no more. \n 2:4 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 以 利 沙 说 ， 耶 和 华 差 遣 我 往 耶 利 哥 去 ， 你 可 以 在 这 里 等 候 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 ， 又 敢 在 你 面 前 起 誓 ， 我 必 不 离 开 你 。 于 是 二 人 到 了 耶 利 哥 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. \n [bbe] Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on to Jericho. \n 2:5 [hgb] 住 耶 利 哥 的 先 知 门 徒 就 近 以 利 沙 ， 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 今 日 要 接 你 的 师 傅 离 开 你 ， 你 知 道 不 知 道 。 他 说 ， 我 知 道 ， 你 们 不 要 作 声 。 \n [kjv] And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. \n [bbe] And at Jericho the sons of the prophets came up to Elisha and said to him, Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today? And he said in answer, Yes, I have knowledge of it: say no more. \n 2:6 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 以 利 沙 说 ， 耶 和 华 差 遣 我 往 约 旦 河 去 ， 你 可 以 在 这 里 等 候 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 ， 又 敢 在 你 面 前 起 誓 ， 我 必 不 离 开 你 。 于 是 二 人 一 同 前 往 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. \n [bbe] Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on together. \n 2:7 [hgb] 有 先 知 门 徒 去 了 五 十 人 ， 远 远 地 站 在 他 们 对 面 。 二 人 在 约 旦 河 边 站 住 。 \n [kjv] And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. \n [bbe] And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off, while the two of them were by the edge of Jordan. \n 2:8 [hgb] 以 利 亚 将 自 己 的 外 衣 卷 起 来 ， 用 以 打 水 ， 水 就 左 右 分 开 ， 二 人 走 干 地 而 过 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. \n [bbe] Then Elijah took off his robe, and, rolling it up, gave the water a blow with it, and the waters were parted, flowing back this way and that, so that they went over on dry land. \n 2:9 [hgb] 过 去 之 后 ， 以 利 亚 对 以 利 沙 说 ， 我 未 曾 被 接 去 离 开 你 ， 你 要 我 为 你 作 什 么 ， 只 管 求 我 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 愿 感 动 你 的 灵 加 倍 地 感 动 我 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. \n [bbe] And when they had come to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, Say what you would have me do for you before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, Be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me. \n 2:10 [hgb] 以 利 亚 说 ， 你 所 求 的 难 得 。 虽 然 如 此 ， 我 被 接 去 离 开 你 的 时 候 ， 你 若 看 见 我 ， 就 必 得 着 。 不 然 ， 必 得 不 着 了 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. \n [bbe] And he said, You have made a hard request: still, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will get your desire; but if not, it will not be so. \n 2:11 [hgb] 他 们 正 走 着 说 话 ， 忽 有 火 车 火 马 将 二 人 隔 开 ， 以 利 亚 就 乘 旋 风 升 天 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. \n [bbe] And while they went on their way, going on talking together, suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and Elijah went up to heaven in a great wind. \n 2:12 [hgb] 以 利 沙 看 见 ， 就 呼 叫 说 ， 我 父 阿 。 我 父 阿 。 以 色 列 的 战 车 马 兵 阿 。 以 后 不 再 见 他 了 。 于 是 以 利 沙 把 自 己 的 衣 服 撕 为 两 片 。 \n [kjv] And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. \n [bbe] And when Elisha saw it he gave a cry, My father, my father, the carriages of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no longer; and he was full of grief. \n 2:13 [hgb] 他 拾 起 以 利 亚 身 上 掉 下 来 的 外 衣 ， 回 去 站 在 约 旦 河 边 。 \n [kjv] He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; \n [bbe] Then he took up Elijah\u0027s robe, which had been dropped from him, and went back till he came to the edge of Jordan. \n 2:14 [hgb] 他 用 以 利 亚 身 上 掉 下 来 的 外 衣 打 水 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 利 亚 的 神 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 打 水 之 后 ， 水 也 左 右 分 开 ， 以 利 沙 就 过 来 了 。 \n [kjv] And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. \n [bbe] And he took Elijah\u0027s robe, which had been dropped from him, and giving the water a blow with it, said, Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah? and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that; and Elisha went over. \n 2:15 [hgb] 住 耶 利 哥 的 先 知 门 徒 从 对 面 看 见 他 ， 就 说 ， 感 动 以 利 亚 的 灵 感 动 以 利 沙 了 。 他 们 就 来 迎 接 他 ， 在 他 面 前 俯 伏 于 地 ， \n [kjv] And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. \n [bbe] And when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. And they came out to him, and went down on the earth before him. \n 2:16 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 仆 人 们 这 里 有 五 十 个 壮 士 ， 求 你 容 他 们 去 寻 找 你 师 傅 ， 或 者 耶 和 华 的 灵 将 他 提 起 来 ， 投 在 某 山 某 谷 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 你 们 不 必 打 发 人 去 。 \n [kjv] And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send. \n [bbe] And they said, Your servants have with us here fifty strong men; be pleased to let them go in search of Elijah; for it may be that the spirit of the Lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley. But he said, Do not send them. \n 2:17 [hgb] 他 们 再 三 催 促 他 ， 他 难 以 推 辞 ， 就 说 ， 你 们 打 发 人 去 吧 。 他 们 便 打 发 五 十 人 去 ， 寻 找 了 三 天 ， 也 没 有 找 着 。 \n [kjv] And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. \n [bbe] But when they kept on requesting him, he was shamed and said, Send, then. So they sent fifty men; but after searching for three days, they came back without having seen him. \n 2:18 [hgb] 以 利 沙 仍 然 在 耶 利 哥 等 候 他 们 回 到 他 那 里 。 他 对 他 们 说 ， 我 岂 没 有 告 诉 你 们 不 必 去 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? \n [bbe] And they came back to him, while he was still at Jericho; and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not? \n 2:19 [hgb] 耶 利 哥 城 的 人 对 以 利 沙 说 ， 这 城 的 地 势 美 好 ， 我 主 看 见 了 。 只 是 水 恶 劣 ， 土 产 不 熟 而 落 。 \n [kjv] And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren. \n [bbe] Now the men of the town said to Elisha, You see that the position of this town is good; but the water is bad, causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead. \n 2:20 [hgb] 以 利 沙 说 ， 你 们 拿 一 个 新 瓶 来 ， 装 盐 给 我 。 他 们 就 拿 来 给 他 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him. \n [bbe] So he said, Get me a new vessel, and put salt in it; and they took it to him. \n 2:21 [hgb] 他 出 到 水 源 ， 将 盐 倒 在 水 中 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 治 好 了 这 水 ， 从 此 必 不 再 使 人 死 ， 也 不 再 使 地 土 不 生 产 。 \n [kjv] And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. \n [bbe] Then he went out to the spring from which the water came, and put salt in it, and said, The Lord says, Now I have made this water sweet; no longer will it be death-giving or unfertile. \n 2:22 [hgb] 于 是 那 水 治 好 了 ， 直 到 今 日 ， 正 如 以 利 沙 所 说 的 。 \n [kjv] So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. \n [bbe] And the water was made sweet again to this day, as Elisha said. \n 2:23 [hgb] 以 利 沙 从 那 里 上 伯 特 利 去 ， 正 上 去 的 时 候 ， 有 些 童 子 从 城 里 出 来 ， 戏 笑 他 说 ， 秃 头 的 上 去 吧 。 秃 头 的 上 去 吧 。 \n [kjv] And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. \n [bbe] Then from there he went up to Beth-el; and on his way, some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him, crying, Go up, old no-hair! go up, old no-hair! \n 2:24 [hgb] 他 回 头 看 见 ， 就 奉 耶 和 华 的 名 咒 诅 他 们 。 于 是 有 两 个 母 熊 从 林 中 出 来 ， 撕 裂 他 们 中 间 四 十 二 个 童 子 。 \n [kjv] And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. \n [bbe] And turning back, he saw them, and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the wood and put forty-two of the children to death. \n 2:25 [hgb] 以 利 沙 从 伯 特 利 上 迦 密 山 ， 又 从 迦 密 山 回 到 撒 玛 利 亚 。 \n [kjv] And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. \n [bbe] From there he went to Mount Carmel, and came back from there to Samaria. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1557.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
