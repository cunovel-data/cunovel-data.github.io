And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses. \n [bbe] And he sent to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has got free from my authority: will you go with me to make war on Moab? And he said, I will go with you: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses. \n 3:8 [hgb] 约 兰 说 ， 我 们 从 哪 条 路 上 去 呢 ？ 回 答 说 ， 从 以 东 旷 野 的 路 上 去 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom. \n [bbe] And he said, Which way are we to go? And he said in answer, By the waste land of Edom. \n 3:9 [hgb] 于 是 ， 以 色 列 王 和 犹 大 王 ， 并 以 东 王 ， 都 一 同 去 绕 行 七 日 的 路 程 。 军 队 和 所 带 的 牲 畜 没 有 水 喝 。 \n [kjv] So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days\u0027 journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. \n [bbe] So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom by a roundabout way for seven days: and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them. \n 3:10 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 说 ， 哀 哉 。 耶 和 华 招 聚 我 们 这 三 王 ， 乃 要 交 在 摩 押 人 的 手 里 。 \n [kjv] And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab! \n [bbe] And the king of Israel said, Here is trouble: for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of Moab. \n 3:11 [hgb] 约 沙 法 说 ， 这 里 不 是 有 耶 和 华 的 先 知 吗 ？ 我 们 可 以 托 他 求 问 耶 和 华 。 以 色 列 王 的 一 个 臣 子 回 答 说 ， 这 里 有 沙 法 的 儿 子 以 利 沙 ， 就 是 从 前 服 事 以 利 亚 的 （ 原 文 作 倒 水 在 以 利 亚 手 上 的 ） 。 \n [kjv] But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel\u0027s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. \n [bbe] But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may get directions from the Lord? And one of the king of Israel\u0027s men said in answer, Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who was servant to Elijah. \n 3:12 [hgb] 约 沙 法 说 ， 他 必 有 耶 和 华 的 话 。 于 是 以 色 列 王 和 约 沙 法 ， 并 以 东 王 都 下 去 见 他 。 \n [kjv] And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. \n [bbe] And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. \n 3:13 [hgb] 以 利 沙 对 以 色 列 王 说 ， 我 与 你 何 干 。 去 问 你 父 亲 的 先 知 和 你 母 亲 的 先 知 吧 。 以 色 列 王 对 他 说 ， 不 要 这 样 说 ， 耶 和 华 招 聚 我 们 这 三 王 ， 乃 要 交 在 摩 押 人 的 手 里 。 \n [kjv] And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. \n [bbe] But Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? go to the prophets of your father and your mother. And the king of Israel said, No; for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of Moab. \n 3:14 [hgb] 以 利 沙 说 ， 我 指 着 所 事 奉 永 生 的 万 军 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 我 若 不 看 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 的 情 面 ， 必 不 理 你 ， 不 顾 你 。 \n [kjv] And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. \n [bbe] Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you. \n 3:15 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 给 我 找 一 个 弹 琴 的 来 。 弹 琴 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 就 降 在 以 利 沙 身 上 。 \n [kjv] But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. \n [bbe] But now, get me a player of music, and it will come about that while the man is playing, the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord: and they got a player of music, and while the man was playing, the hand of the Lord was on him. \n 3:16 [hgb] 他 便 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 要 在 这 谷 中 满 处 挖 沟 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. \n [bbe] And he said, The Lord says, I will make this valley full of water-holes. \n 3:17 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 虽 不 见 风 ， 不 见 雨 ， 这 谷 必 满 了 水 ， 使 你 们 和 牲 畜 有 水 喝 。 \n [kjv] For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. \n [bbe] For the Lord says, Though you see no wind or rain, the valley will be full of water, and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink. \n 3:18 [hgb] 在 耶 和 华 眼 中 这 还 算 为 小 事 ， 他 也 必 将 摩 押 人 交 在 你 们 手 中 。 \n [kjv] And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. \n [bbe] And this will be only a small thing to the Lord: in addition he will give the Moabites into your hands. \n 3:19 [hgb] 你 们 必 攻 破 一 切 坚 城 美 邑 ， 砍 伐 各 种 佳 树 ， 塞 住 一 切 水 泉 ， 用 石 头 糟 踏 一 切 美 田 。 \n [kjv] And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. \n [bbe] And you are to put every walled town to destruction, cutting down every good tree, and stopping up every water-spring, and making all the good land rough with stones. \n 3:20 [hgb] 次 日 早 晨 ， 约 在 献 祭 的 时 候 ， 有 水 从 以 东 而 来 ， 遍 地 就 满 了 水 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. \n [bbe] Now in the morning, about the time when the offering was made, they saw water flowing from the direction of Edom till the country was full of water. \n 3:21 [hgb] 摩 押 众 人 听 见 这 三 王 上 来 要 与 他 们 争 战 ， 凡 能 顶 盔 贯 甲 的 ， 无 论 老 少 ， 尽 都 聚 集 站 在 边 界 上 。 \n [kjv] And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. \n [bbe] Now all Moab, hearing that the kings had come to make war against them, got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country. \n 3:22 [hgb] 次 日 早 晨 ， 日 光 照 在 水 上 ， 摩 押 人 起 来 ， 看 见 对 面 水 红 如 血 ， \n [kjv] And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood: \n [bbe] And early in the morning they got up, when the sun was shining on the water, and they saw the water facing them as red as blood. \n 3:23 [hgb] 就 说 ， 这 是 血 阿 。 必 是 三 王 互 相 击 杀 ， 俱 都 灭 亡 。 摩 押 人 哪 ， 我 们 现 在 去 抢 夺 财 物 吧 。 \n [kjv] And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. \n [bbe] Then they said, This is blood: it is clear that destruction has come on the kings; they have been fighting one another: now come, Moab, let us take their goods. \n 3:24 [hgb] 摩 押 人 到 了 以 色 列 营 ， 以 色 列 人 就 起 来 攻 打 他 们 ， 以 致 他 们 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 逃 跑 。 以 色 列 人 往 前 追 杀 摩 押 人 ， 直 杀 入 摩 押 的 境 内 ， \n [kjv] And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. \n [bbe] But when they came to the tents of Israel, the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites, so that they went in flight before them; and they went forward still attacking them; \n 3:25 [hgb] 拆 毁 摩 押 的 城 邑 ， 各 人 抛 石 填 满 一 切 美 田 ， 塞 住 一 切 水 泉 ， 砍 伐 各 种 佳 树 ， 只 剩 下 吉 珥 哈 列 设 的 石 墙 。 甩 石 的 兵 在 四 围 攻 打 那 城 。 \n [kjv] And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it. \n [bbe] Pulling down the towns, covering every good field with stones, stopping up all the water-springs, and cutting down all the good trees; they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kir-hareseth were there any Moabites; and the fighting-men went round the town raining stones on it. \n 3:26 [hgb] 摩 押 王 见 阵 势 甚 大 ， 难 以 对 敌 ， 就 率 领 七 百 拿 刀 的 兵 ， 要 冲 过 阵 去 到 以 东 王 那 里 ， 却 是 不 能 。 \n [kjv] And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not. \n [bbe] And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him, he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords, with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram, but they were not able to do so. \n 3:27 [hgb] 便 将 那 应 当 接 续 他 作 王 的 长 子 ， 在 城 上 献 为 燔 祭 。 以 色 列 人 遭 遇 耶 和 华 的 大 怒 （ 或 作 招 人 痛 恨 ） ， 于 是 三 王 离 开 摩 押 王 ， 各 回 本 国 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land. \n [bbe] Then he took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, offering him as a burned offering on the wall. So there was great wrath against Israel; and they went away from him, back to their country. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1558.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
