{"id":5779,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 利 玛 利 的 儿 子 比 加 十 七 年 ， 犹 大 王 约 坦 的 儿 子 亚 哈 斯 登 基 。 [kjv] In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. [bbe] In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, Ahaz, the son of Jotham, became king of Judah. 16:2 [hgb] 他 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 十 六 年 。 不 像 他 祖 大 卫 行 耶 和 华 他 神 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， [kjv] Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father. [bbe] Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king; he was ruling for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God, as David his father did. 16:3 [hgb] 却 效 法 以 色 列 诸 王 所 行 的 ， 又 照 着 耶 和 华 从 以 色 列 人 面 前 赶 出 的 外 邦 人 所 行 可 憎 的 事 ， 使 他 的 儿 子 经 火 ， [kjv] But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel. [bbe] But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel, and even made his son go through the fire, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel. 16:4 [hgb] 并 在 丘 坛 上 ， 山 冈 上 ， 各 青 翠 树 下 献 祭 烧 香 。 [kjv] And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. [bbe] And he made offerings, burning them in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree. 16:5 [hgb] 亚 兰 王 利 汛 和 以 色 列 王 利 玛 利 的 儿 子 比 加 上 来 攻 打 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 围 困 亚 哈 斯 ， 却 不 能 胜 他 。 [kjv] Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. [bbe] Then Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war; and they made an attack on Ahaz, shutting him in, but were not able to overcome him. 16:6 [hgb] 当 时 亚 兰 王 利 汛 收 回 以 拉 他 归 与 亚 兰 ， 将 犹 大 人 从 以 拉 他 赶 出 去 。 亚 兰 人 （ 有 作 以 东 人 的 ） 就 来 到 以 拉 他 ， 住 在 那 里 ， 直 到 今 日 。 [kjv] At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day. [bbe] At that time the king of Edom got Elath back for Edom, and sent the Jews out of Elath; and the Edomites came back to Elath where they are living to this day. 16:7 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 差 遣 使 者 去 见 亚 述 王 提 革 拉 毗 列 色 ， 说 ， 我 是 你 的 仆 人 ， 你 的 儿 子 。 现 在 亚 兰 王 和 以 色 列 王 攻 击 我 ， 求 你 来 救 我 脱 离 他 们 的 手 。 [kjv] So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me. [bbe] So Ahaz sent representatives to Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son; come to my help against the kings of Aram and Israel who have taken up arms against me. 16:8 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 将 耶 和 华 殿 里 和 王 宫 府 库 里 所 有 的 金 银 都 送 给 亚 述 王 为 礼 物 。 [kjv] And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king\u0027s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. [bbe] And Ahaz took the silver and gold which were in the house of the Lord and in the king\u0027s store-house, and sent them as an offering to the king of Assyria. 16:9 [hgb] 亚 述 王 应 允 了 他 ， 就 上 去 攻 打 大 马 色 ， 将 城 攻 取 ， 杀 了 利 汛 ， 把 居 民 掳 到 吉 珥 。 [kjv] And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin. [bbe] And the king of Assyria, in answer to his request, went up against Damascus and took it, and took its people away as prisoners to Kir, and put Rezin to death. 16:10 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 王 上 大 马 色 去 迎 接 亚 述 王 提 革 拉 毗 列 色 ， 在 大 马 色 看 见 一 座 坛 ， 就 照 坛 的 规 模 样 式 作 法 画 了 图 样 ， 送 到 祭 司 乌 利 亚 那 里 。 [kjv] And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof. [bbe] Then King Ahaz went to Damascus for a meeting with Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria; and there he saw the altar which was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a copy of the altar, giving the design of it and all the details of its structure. 16:11 [hgb] 祭 司 乌 利 亚 照 着 亚 哈 斯 王 从 大 马 色 送 来 的 图 样 ， 在 亚 哈 斯 王 没 有 从 大 马 色 回 来 之 先 ， 建 筑 一 座 坛 。 [kjv] And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus. [bbe] And from the copy King Ahaz sent from Damascus, Urijah made an altar and had it ready by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus. 16:12 [hgb] 王 从 大 马 色 回 来 看 见 坛 ， 就 近 前 来 ， 在 坛 上 献 祭 。 [kjv] And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon. [bbe] And when the king came from Damascus, he saw the altar; and he went up on it and made an offering on it. 16:13 [hgb] 烧 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 浇 奠 祭 ， 将 平 安 祭 牲 的 血 洒 在 坛 上 ， [kjv] And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar. [bbe] He made his burned offering and his meal offering and his drink offering there, draining out the blood of his peace-offerings on the altar. 16:14 [hgb] 又 将 耶 和 华 面 前 的 铜 坛 从 耶 和 华 殿 和 新 坛 的 中 间 搬 到 新 坛 的 北 边 。 [kjv] And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar. [bbe] And the brass altar, which was before the Lord, he took from the front of the house, from between his altar and the house of the Lord, and put it on the north side of his altar. 16:15 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 王 吩 咐 祭 司 乌 利 亚 说 ， 早 晨 的 燔 祭 ， 晚 上 的 素 祭 ， 王 的 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 国 内 众 民 的 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 奠 祭 都 要 烧 在 大 坛 上 。 燔 祭 牲 和 平 安 祭 牲 的 血 也 要 洒 在 这 坛 上 ， 只 是 铜 坛 我 要 用 以 求 问 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king\u0027s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by. [bbe] And King Ahaz gave orders to Urijah the priest, saying, Make the morning burned offering and the evening meal offering and the king\u0027s burned offering and meal offering, with the burned offerings of all the people and their meal offerings and drink offerings, on the great altar, and put on it all the blood of the burned offerings and of the beasts which are offered; but the brass altar will be for my use to get directions from the Lord. 16:16 [hgb] 祭 司 乌 利 亚 就 照 着 亚 哈 斯 王 所 吩 咐 的 行 了 。 [kjv] Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. [bbe] So Urijah the priest did everything as the king said 16:17 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 王 打 掉 盆 座 四 面 镶 着 的 心 子 ， 把 盆 从 座 上 挪 下 来 ， 又 将 铜 海 从 驮 海 的 铜 牛 上 搬 下 来 ， 放 在 铺 石 地 。 [kjv] And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones. [bbe] And King Ahaz took off the sides of the wheeled bases, and took down the great water-vessel from off the brass oxen which were under it and put it on a floor of stone. 16:18 [hgb] 又 因 亚 述 王 的 缘 故 ， 将 耶 和 华 殿 为 安 息 日 所 盖 的 廊 子 和 王 从 外 入 殿 的 廊 子 挪 移 ， 围 绕 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 [kjv] And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king\u0027s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria. [bbe] *** the house of the Lord, because of the king of Assyria. 16:19 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 其 余 所 行 的 事 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? [bbe] Now the rest of the things which Ahaz did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? 16:20 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 儿 子 希 西 家 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; and Hezekiah his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1571.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
