And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. \\n\\n [bbe] So the king of Aram said, Go then; and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, taking with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing. \\n\\n 5:6 [hgb] 且 带 信 给 以 色 列 王 ， 信 上 说 ， 我 打 发 臣 仆 乃 缦 去 见 你 ， 你 接 到 这 信 ， 就 要 治 好 他 的 大 麻 疯 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took the letter to the king of Israel, in which the king of Aram had said, See, I have sent my servant Naaman to you to be made well, for he is a leper. \\n\\n 5:7 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 看 了 信 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 说 ， 我 岂 是 神 ， 能 使 人 死 使 人 活 呢 ？ 这 人 竟 打 发 人 来 ， 叫 我 治 好 他 的 大 麻 疯 。 你 们 看 一 看 ， 这 人 何 以 寻 隙 攻 击 我 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. \\n\\n [bbe] But the king of Israel, after reading the letter, was greatly troubled and said, Am I God, to give death and life? why does this man send a leper to me to be made well? is it not clear that he is looking for a cause of war? \\n\\n 5:8 [hgb] 神 人 以 利 沙 听 见 以 色 列 王 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 就 打 发 人 去 见 王 ， 说 ， 你 为 什 么 撕 了 衣 服 呢 ？ 可 使 那 人 到 我 这 里 来 ， 他 就 知 道 以 色 列 中 有 先 知 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Elisha, the man of God, hearing that the king of Israel had done this, sent to the king, saying, Why are you troubled? send the man to me, so that he may see that there is a prophet in Israel. \\n\\n 5:9 [hgb] 于 是 ， 乃 缦 带 着 车 马 到 了 以 利 沙 的 家 ， 站 在 门 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. \\n\\n [bbe] So Naaman, with all his horses and his carriages, came to the door of Elisha\u0027s house. \\n\\n 5:10 [hgb] 以 利 沙 打 发 一 个 使 者 ， 对 乃 缦 说 ， 你 去 在 约 旦 河 中 沐 浴 七 回 ， 你 的 肉 就 必 复 原 ， 而 得 洁 净 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. \\n\\n [bbe] And Elisha sent a servant to him, saying, Go to Jordan, and after washing seven times in its waters your flesh will be well again and you will be clean. \\n\\n 5:11 [hgb] 乃 缦 却 发 怒 走 了 ， 说 ， 我 想 他 必 定 出 来 见 我 ， 站 着 求 告 耶 和 华 他 神 的 名 ， 在 患 处 以 上 摇 手 ， 治 好 这 大 麻 疯 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. \\n\\n [bbe] But Naaman was angry and went away and said, I had the idea that he would come out to see such an important person as I am, and make prayer to the Lord his God, and with a wave of his hand over the place make the leper well. \\n\\n 5:12 [hgb] 大 马 色 的 河 亚 吧 拿 和 法 珥 法 岂 不 比 以 色 列 的 一 切 水 更 好 吗 ？ 我 在 那 里 沐 浴 不 得 洁 净 吗 ？ 于 是 气 忿 忿 地 转 身 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. \\n\\n [bbe] Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not be washed in them and become clean? So turning, he went away in wrath. \\n\\n 5:13 [hgb] 他 的 仆 人 进 前 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 父 阿 ， 先 知 若 吩 咐 你 作 一 件 大 事 ， 你 岂 不 作 吗 ？ 何 况 说 你 去 沐 浴 而 得 洁 净 呢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? \\n\\n [bbe] Then his servants came to him and said, If the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much more then, when he says to you, Be washed and become clean? \\n\\n 5:14 [hgb] 于 是 乃 缦 下 去 ， 照 着 神 人 的 话 ， 在 约 旦 河 里 沐 浴 七 回 。 他 的 肉 复 原 ， 好 像 小 孩 子 的 肉 ， 他 就 洁 净 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he went down seven times into the waters of Jordan, as the man of God had said; and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again, and he was clean. \\n\\n 5:15 [hgb] 乃 缦 带 着 一 切 跟 随 他 的 人 ， 回 到 神 人 那 里 ， 站 在 他 面 前 ， 说 ， 如 今 我 知 道 ， 除 了 以 色 列 之 外 ， 普 天 下 没 有 神 。 现 在 求 你 收 点 仆 人 的 礼 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he went back to the man of God, with all his train, and, taking his place before him, said, Now I am certain that there is no God in all the earth, but only in Israel: now then, take an offering from me. \\n\\n 5:16 [hgb] 以 利 沙 说 ， 我 指 着 所 事 奉 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 我 必 不 受 。 乃 缦 再 三 地 求 他 ， 他 却 不 受 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused. \\n\\n [bbe] But he said, By the life of the Lord whose servant I am, I will take nothing from you. And he did his best to make him take it but he would not. \\n\\n 5:17 [hgb] 乃 缦 说 ， 你 若 不 肯 受 ， 请 将 两 骡 子 驮 的 土 赐 给 仆 人 。 从 今 以 后 ， 仆 人 必 不 再 将 燔 祭 或 平 安 祭 献 与 别 神 ， 只 献 给 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules\u0027 burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Naaman said, If you will not, then let there be given to your servant as much earth as two beasts are able to take on their backs; because from now on, your servant will make no offering or burned offering to other gods, but only to the Lord. \\n\\n 5:18 [hgb] 惟 有 一 件 事 ， 愿 耶 和 华 饶 恕 你 仆 人 ， 我 主 人 进 临 门 庙 叩 拜 的 时 候 ， 我 用 手 搀 他 在 临 门 庙 ， 我 也 屈 身 。 我 在 临 门 庙 屈 身 的 这 事 ， 愿 耶 和 华 饶 恕 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. \\n\\n [bbe] But may your servant have the Lord\u0027s forgiveness for this one thing: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon for worship there, supported on my arm, and my head is bent in the house of Rimmon; when his head is bent in the house of Rimmon, may your servant have the Lord\u0027s forgiveness for this thing. \\n\\n 5:19 [hgb] 以 利 沙 对 他 说 ， 你 可 以 平 平 安 安 地 回 去 。 乃 缦 就 离 开 他 去 了 。 走 了 不 远 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, Go in peace. And he went from him some distance. \\n\\n 5:20 [hgb] 神 人 以 利 沙 的 仆 人 基 哈 西 心 里 说 ， 我 主 人 不 愿 从 这 亚 兰 人 乃 缦 手 里 受 他 带 来 的 礼 物 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 我 必 跑 去 追 上 他 ， 向 他 要 些 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. \\n\\n [bbe] But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, Now my master has taken nothing from Naaman, this Aramaean, of what he would have given him: by the living Lord, I will go after him and get something from him. \\n\\n 5:21 [hgb] 于 是 基 哈 西 追 赶 乃 缦 。 乃 缦 看 见 有 人 追 赶 ， 就 急 忙 下 车 迎 着 他 ， 说 ， 都 平 安 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? \\n\\n [bbe] So Gehazi went after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said, Is all well? \\n\\n 5:22 [hgb] 说 ， 都 平 安 。 我 主 人 打 发 我 来 说 ， 刚 才 有 两 个 少 年 人 ， 是 先 知 门 徒 ， 从 以 法 莲 山 地 来 见 我 ， 请 你 赐 他 们 一 他 连 得 银 子 ， 两 套 衣 裳 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, All is well: but my master has sent me, saying, Even now, two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim; will you give me a talent of silver and two changes of clothing for them? \\n\\n 5:23 [hgb] 乃 缦 说 ， 请 受 二 他 连 得 。 再 三 地 请 受 ， 便 将 二 他 连 得 银 子 装 在 两 个 口 袋 里 ， 又 将 两 套 衣 裳 交 给 两 个 仆 人 。 他 们 就 在 基 哈 西 前 头 抬 着 走 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Naaman said, Be good enough to take two talents. And forcing him to take them, he put two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to his two servants to take before him. \\n\\n 5:24 [hgb] 到 了 山 冈 ， 基 哈 西 从 他 们 手 中 接 过 来 ， 放 在 屋 里 ， 打 发 他 们 回 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. \\n\\n [bbe] When he came to the hill, he took them from their hands, and put them away in the house; and he sent the men away, and they went. \\n\\n 5:25 [hgb] 基 哈 西 进 去 ， 站 在 他 主 人 面 前 。 以 利 沙 问 他 说 ， 基 哈 西 你 从 哪 里 来 。 回 答 说 ， 仆 人 没 有 往 哪 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he came in and took his place before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where have you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went nowhere. \\n\\n 5:26 [hgb] 以 利 沙 对 他 说 ， 那 人 下 车 转 回 迎 你 的 时 候 ， 我 的 心 岂 没 有 去 呢 ？ 这 岂 是 受 银 子 ， 衣 裳 ， 买 橄 榄 园 ， 葡 萄 园 ， 牛 羊 ， 仆 婢 的 时 候 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, Did not my heart go with you, when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you? Is this a time for getting money, and clothing, and olive-gardens and vine-gardens, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants? \\n\\n 5:27 [hgb] 因 此 ， 乃 缦 的 大 麻 疯 必 沾 染 你 和 你 的 后 裔 ， 直 到 永 远 。 基 哈 西 从 以 利 沙 面 前 退 出 去 ， 就 长 了 大 麻 疯 ， 像 雪 那 样 白 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow. \\n\\n [bbe] Because of what you have done, the disease of Naaman the leper will take you in its grip, and your seed after you, for ever. And he went out from before him a leper as white as snow. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1560.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
