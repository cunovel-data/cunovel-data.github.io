{"id":5785,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"22:1 [hgb] 约 西 亚 登 基 的 时 候 年 八 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 三 十 一 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 耶 底 大 ， 是 波 斯 加 人 亚 大 雅 的 女 儿 。 [kjv] Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. [bbe] Josiah was eight years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirty-one years; his mother\u0027s name was Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 22:2 [hgb] 约 西 亚 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 行 他 祖 大 卫 一 切 所 行 的 ， 不 偏 左 右 。 [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. [bbe] He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, walking in the ways of David his father, without turning to the right hand or to the left. 22:3 [hgb] 约 西 亚 王 十 八 年 ， 王 差 遣 米 书 兰 的 孙 子 ， 亚 萨 利 的 儿 子 书 记 沙 番 上 耶 和 华 殿 去 ， 吩 咐 他 说 ， [kjv] And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, [bbe] Now in the eighteenth year after he became king, Josiah sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord, saying to him, 22:4 [hgb] 你 去 见 大 祭 司 希 勒 家 ， 使 他 将 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 银 子 ， 就 是 守 门 的 从 民 中 收 聚 的 银 子 ， 数 算 数 算 ， [kjv] Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people: [bbe] Go up to Hilkiah, the chief priest, and let him give out the money which is taken into the house of the Lord, which the keepers of the door have got together from the people; 22:5 [hgb] 交 给 耶 和 华 殿 里 办 事 的 人 ， 使 他 们 转 交 耶 和 华 殿 里 作 工 的 人 ， 好 修 理 殿 的 破 坏 之 处 ， [kjv] And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, [bbe] And let it be given to the overseers of the work of the Lord\u0027s house, to give to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the house of the Lord; 22:6 [hgb] 就 是 转 交 木 匠 和 工 人 ， 并 瓦 匠 ， 又 买 木 料 和 凿 成 的 石 头 修 理 殿 宇 ， [kjv] Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. [bbe] To the woodworkers and the builders and the stone-cutters; and for getting wood and cut stones for the building up of the house. 22:7 [hgb] 将 银 子 交 在 办 事 的 人 手 里 ， 不 与 他 们 算 帐 ， 因 为 他 们 办 事 诚 实 。 [kjv] Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully. [bbe] They did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them, for they made use of it with good faith. 22:8 [hgb] 大 祭 司 希 勒 家 对 书 记 沙 番 说 ， 我 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 得 了 律 法 书 。 希 勒 家 将 书 递 给 沙 番 ， 沙 番 就 看 了 。 [kjv] And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. [bbe] Then Hilkiah, the chief priest, said to Shaphan the scribe, I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord. So Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan; 22:9 [hgb] 书 记 沙 番 到 王 那 里 ， 回 覆 王 说 ， 你 的 仆 人 已 将 殿 里 的 银 子 倒 出 数 算 ， 交 给 耶 和 华 殿 里 办 事 的 人 了 。 [kjv] And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD. [bbe] Then, after reading it, Shaphan the scribe went in to the king and gave him an account of what had been done, saying, Your servants have given out the money which was in the house, and have given it to the overseers of the work of the house of the Lord. 22:10 [hgb] 书 记 沙 番 又 对 王 说 ， 祭 司 希 勒 家 递 给 我 一 卷 书 。 沙 番 就 在 王 面 前 读 那 书 。 [kjv] And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. [bbe] Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book; and he was reading it before the king. 22:11 [hgb] 王 听 见 律 法 书 上 的 话 ， 便 撕 裂 衣 服 ， [kjv] And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. [bbe] And the king, hearing the words of the book of the law, took his robe in his hands, violently parting it as a sign of his grief; 22:12 [hgb] 吩 咐 祭 司 希 勒 家 与 沙 番 的 儿 子 亚 希 甘 ， 米 该 亚 的 儿 子 亚 革 波 ， 书 记 沙 番 和 王 的 臣 仆 亚 撒 雅 ， 说 ， [kjv] And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king\u0027s, saying, [bbe] And he gave orders to Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Achbor, the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king\u0027s servant, saying, 22:13 [hgb] 你 们 去 为 我 ， 为 民 ， 为 犹 大 众 人 ， 以 这 书 上 的 话 求 问 耶 和 华 。 因 为 我 们 列 祖 没 有 听 从 这 书 上 的 言 语 ， 没 有 遵 着 书 上 所 吩 咐 我 们 的 去 行 ， 耶 和 华 就 向 我 们 大 发 烈 怒 。 [kjv] Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. [bbe] Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah, about the words of this book which has come to light; for great is the wrath of the Lord which is burning against us, because our fathers have not given ear to the words of this book, to do all the things which are recorded in it. 22:14 [hgb] 于 是 ， 祭 司 希 勒 家 和 亚 希 甘 ， 亚 革 波 ， 沙 番 ， 亚 撒 雅 都 去 见 女 先 知 户 勒 大 。 户 勒 大 是 掌 管 礼 服 沙 龙 的 妻 。 沙 龙 是 哈 珥 哈 斯 的 孙 子 ， 特 瓦 的 儿 子 。 户 勒 大 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 第 二 区 。 他 们 请 问 于 她 。 [kjv] So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her. [bbe] So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam and Achbor and Shaphan and Asaiah, went to Huldah the woman prophet, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the robes, (now she was living in Jerusalem, in the second part of the town;) and they had talk with her. 22:15 [hgb] 她 对 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 你 们 可 以 回 覆 那 差 遣 你 们 来 见 我 的 人 说 ， [kjv] And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me, [bbe] And she said to them, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, Say to the man who sent you to me, 22:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 必 照 着 犹 大 王 所 读 那 书 上 的 一 切 话 ， 降 祸 与 这 地 和 其 上 的 居 民 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: [bbe] These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even everything which the king of Judah has been reading in the book; 22:17 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 离 弃 我 ， 向 别 神 烧 香 ， 用 他 们 手 所 作 的 惹 我 发 怒 ， 所 以 我 的 忿 怒 必 向 这 地 发 作 ， 总 不 止 息 。 [kjv] Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. [bbe] Because they have given me up, burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the work of their hands; so my wrath will be on fire against this place, and will not be put out. 22:18 [hgb] 然 而 ， 差 遣 你 们 来 求 问 耶 和 华 的 犹 大 王 ， 你 们 要 这 样 回 覆 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 至 于 你 所 听 见 的 话 ， [kjv] But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard; [bbe] But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord, say, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: As to the words which have come to your ears, 22:19 [hgb] 就 是 听 见 我 指 着 这 地 和 其 上 的 居 民 所 说 ， 要 使 这 地 变 为 荒 场 ， 民 受 咒 诅 的 话 ， 你 便 心 里 敬 服 ， 在 我 面 前 自 卑 ， 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 向 我 哭 泣 ， 因 此 我 应 允 了 你 。 这 是 我 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. [bbe] Because your heart was soft, and you made yourself low before me, when you had word of what I said against this place and its people, that they would become a waste and a curse, and you gave signs of grief, weeping before me: truly, I have given ear to you, says the Lord. 22:20 [hgb] 我 必 使 你 平 平 安 安 地 归 到 坟 墓 到 你 列 祖 那 里 。 我 要 降 与 这 地 的 一 切 灾 祸 ， 你 也 不 至 亲 眼 看 见 。 他 们 就 回 覆 王 去 了 。 [kjv] Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again. [bbe] For this cause I will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last resting-place in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place. So they took this news back to the king.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1577.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
