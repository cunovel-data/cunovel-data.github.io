{"id":5771,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 以 利 沙 曾 对 所 救 活 之 子 的 那 妇 人 说 ， 你 和 你 的 全 家 要 起 身 往 你 可 住 的 地 方 去 住 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 命 饥 荒 降 在 这 地 七 年 。 [kjv] Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years. [bbe] Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life, Go now, with all the people of your house, and get a living-place for yourselves wherever you are able; for by the word of the Lord, there will be great need of food in the land; and this will go on for seven years. 8:2 [hgb] 妇 人 就 起 身 ， 照 神 人 的 话 带 着 全 家 往 非 利 士 地 去 ， 住 了 七 年 。 [kjv] And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. [bbe] So the woman got up and did as the man of God said; and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 8:3 [hgb] 七 年 完 了 ， 那 妇 人 从 非 利 士 地 回 来 ， 就 出 去 为 自 己 的 房 屋 田 地 哀 告 王 。 [kjv] And it came to pass at the seven years\u0027 end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. [bbe] And when the seven years were ended, the woman came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land. 8:4 [hgb] 那 时 王 正 与 神 人 的 仆 人 基 哈 西 说 ， 请 你 将 以 利 沙 所 行 的 一 切 大 事 告 诉 我 。 [kjv] And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. [bbe] Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Now, give me an account of all the great things Elisha has done. 8:5 [hgb] 基 哈 西 告 诉 王 以 利 沙 如 何 使 死 人 复 活 ， 恰 巧 以 利 沙 所 救 活 ， 她 儿 子 的 那 妇 人 为 自 己 的 房 屋 田 地 来 哀 告 王 。 基 哈 西 说 ， 我 主 我 王 ， 这 就 是 那 妇 人 ， 这 是 她 的 儿 子 ， 就 是 以 利 沙 所 救 活 的 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life. [bbe] And while he was giving the king the story of how Elisha had given life to the dead, the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, My lord king, this is the woman and this is her son, whose life Elisha gave back to him. 8:6 [hgb] 王 问 那 妇 人 ， 她 就 把 那 事 告 诉 王 。 于 是 王 为 她 派 一 个 太 监 ， 说 ， 凡 属 这 妇 人 的 都 还 给 她 ， 自 从 她 离 开 本 地 直 到 今 日 ， 她 田 地 的 出 产 也 都 还 给 她 。 [kjv] And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now. [bbe] And in answer to the king\u0027s questions, the woman gave him all the story. So the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants, saying, Give her back all her property, and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up till now. 8:7 [hgb] 以 利 沙 来 到 大 马 色 ， 亚 兰 王 便 哈 达 正 患 病 。 有 人 告 诉 王 说 ， 神 人 来 到 这 里 了 。 [kjv] And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. [bbe] And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad, king of Aram, was ill; and they said to him, The man of God has come. 8:8 [hgb] 王 就 吩 咐 哈 薛 说 ， 你 带 着 礼 物 去 见 神 人 ， 托 他 求 问 耶 和 华 ， 我 这 病 能 好 不 能 好 。 [kjv] And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? [bbe] Then the king said to Hazael, Take an offering with you, and go to see the man of God and get directions from the Lord by him, saying, Am I going to get better from my disease? 8:9 [hgb] 于 是 哈 薛 用 四 十 个 骆 驼 ， 驮 着 大 马 色 的 各 样 美 物 为 礼 物 ， 去 见 以 利 沙 。 到 了 他 那 里 ， 站 在 他 面 前 ， 说 ， 你 儿 子 亚 兰 王 便 哈 达 打 发 我 来 见 你 ， 他 问 说 ， 我 这 病 能 好 不 能 好 。 [kjv] So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels\u0027 burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? [bbe] So Hazael went to see him, taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from Damascus; and when he came before him, he said, Your son Ben-hadad, king of Aram, has sent me to you, saying, Will I get better from this disease? 8:10 [hgb] 以 利 沙 对 哈 薛 说 ， 你 回 去 告 诉 他 说 ， 这 病 必 能 好 。 但 耶 和 华 指 示 我 ， 他 必 要 死 。 [kjv] And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. [bbe] And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You will certainly get better; but the Lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him. 8:11 [hgb] 神 人 定 睛 看 着 哈 薛 ， 甚 致 他 惭 愧 。 神 人 就 哭 了 。 [kjv] And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept. [bbe] And he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed, and the man of God was overcome with weeping. 8:12 [hgb] 哈 薛 说 ， 我 主 为 什 么 哭 。 回 答 说 ， 因 为 我 知 道 你 必 苦 害 以 色 列 人 ， 用 火 焚 烧 他 们 的 保 障 ， 用 刀 杀 死 他 们 的 壮 丁 ， 摔 死 他 们 的 婴 孩 ， 剖 开 他 们 的 孕 妇 。 [kjv] And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. [bbe] And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping? Then he said in answer, Because I see the evil which you will do to the children of Israel: burning down their strong towns, putting their young men to death with the sword, smashing their little ones against the stones, and cutting open the women who are with child. 8:13 [hgb] 哈 薛 说 ， 你 仆 人 算 什 么 ， 不 过 是 一 条 狗 ， 焉 能 行 这 大 事 呢 ？ 以 利 沙 回 答 说 ， 耶 和 华 指 示 我 ， 你 必 作 亚 兰 王 。 [kjv] And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria. [bbe] And Hazael said, How is it possible that your servant, who is only a dog, will do this great thing? And Elisha said, The Lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over Aram. 8:14 [hgb] 哈 薛 离 开 以 利 沙 ， 回 去 见 他 的 主 人 。 主 人 问 他 说 ， 以 利 沙 对 你 说 什 么 。 回 答 说 ， 他 告 诉 我 你 必 能 好 。 [kjv] So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover. [bbe] Then he went away from Elisha and came in to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And his answer was, He said that you would certainly get well. 8:15 [hgb] 次 日 ， 哈 薛 拿 被 窝 浸 在 水 中 ， 蒙 住 王 的 脸 ， 王 就 死 了 。 于 是 哈 薛 篡 了 他 的 位 。 [kjv] And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead. [bbe] Now on the day after, Hazael took the bed-cover, and making it wet with water, put it over Ben-hadad\u0027s face, causing his death: and Hazael became king in his place. 8:16 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 第 五 年 ， 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 还 在 位 的 时 候 ， 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 约 兰 登 基 作 了 犹 大 王 。 [kjv] And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. [bbe] In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became king. 8:17 [hgb] 约 兰 登 基 的 时 候 年 三 十 二 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 八 年 。 [kjv] Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. [bbe] He was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years. 8:18 [hgb] 他 行 以 色 列 诸 王 所 行 的 ， 与 亚 哈 家 一 样 。 因 为 他 娶 了 亚 哈 的 女 儿 为 妻 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 。 [kjv] And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. [bbe] He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the family of Ahab did: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord. 8:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 却 因 他 仆 人 大 卫 的 缘 故 ， 仍 不 肯 灭 绝 犹 大 ， 照 他 所 应 许 大 卫 的 话 ， 永 远 赐 灯 光 与 他 的 子 孙 。 [kjv] Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant\u0027s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children. [bbe] But it was not the Lord\u0027s purpose to send destruction on Judah, because of David his servant, to whom he had given his word that he would have a light for ever. 8:20 [hgb] 约 兰 年 间 ， 以 东 人 背 叛 犹 大 ， 脱 离 他 的 权 下 ， 自 己 立 王 。 [kjv] In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. [bbe] In his time, Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves. 8:21 [hgb] 约 兰 率 领 所 有 的 战 车 往 撒 益 去 ， 夜 间 起 来 ， 攻 打 围 困 他 的 以 东 人 和 车 兵 长 。 犹 大 兵 就 逃 跑 ， 各 回 各 家 去 了 。 [kjv] So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents. [bbe] Then Joram went over to Zair, with all his war-carriages; ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him, ... the captains of the war-carriages; and the people went in flight to their tents. 8:22 [hgb] 这 样 ， 以 东 人 背 叛 犹 大 ， 脱 离 他 的 权 下 ， 直 到 今 日 。 那 时 立 拿 人 也 背 叛 了 。 [kjv] Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. [bbe] So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah to this day. And at the same time, Libnah made itself free. 8:23 [hgb] 约 兰 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 ， 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? 8:24 [hgb] 约 兰 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] And Joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David: and Ahaziah his son became king in his place. 8:25 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 十 二 年 ， 犹 大 王 约 兰 的 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 登 基 。 [kjv] In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. [bbe] In the twelfth year that Joram, the son of Ahab, was king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, became king; 8:26 [hgb] 他 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 二 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 一 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 亚 他 利 雅 ， 是 以 色 列 王 暗 利 的 孙 女 。 [kjv] Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel. [bbe] Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year. His mother\u0027s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel. 8:27 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 效 法 亚 哈 家 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 与 亚 哈 家 一 样 ， 因 为 他 是 亚 哈 家 的 女 婿 。 [kjv] And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab. [bbe] He went in the ways of the family of Ahab, and did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the family of Ahab did, for he was a son-in-law of the family of Ahab. 8:28 [hgb] 他 与 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 同 往 基 列 的 拉 末 去 ， 与 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 争 战 。 亚 兰 人 打 伤 了 约 兰 ， [kjv] And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. [bbe] He went with Joram, the son of Ahab, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the Aramaeans. 8:29 [hgb] 约 兰 王 回 到 耶 斯 列 ， 医 治 在 拉 末 与 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 打 仗 的 时 候 所 受 的 伤 。 犹 大 王 约 兰 的 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 因 为 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 病 了 ， 就 下 到 耶 斯 列 看 望 他 。 [kjv] And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. [bbe] So King Joram went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the bowmen had given him at Ramah, when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel, because he was ill.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1563.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
