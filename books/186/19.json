{"id":5782,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"19:1 [hgb] 希 西 家 王 听 见 ， 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 披 上 麻 布 ， 进 了 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. [bbe] And on hearing it, King Hezekiah took off his robe, and put on haircloth, and went into the house of the Lord. 19:2 [hgb] 使 家 宰 以 利 亚 敬 和 书 记 舍 伯 那 ， 并 祭 司 中 的 长 老 ， 都 披 上 麻 布 ， 去 见 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 先 知 以 赛 亚 ， [kjv] And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. [bbe] And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the chief priests, dressed in haircloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 19:3 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 希 西 家 如 此 说 ， 今 日 是 急 难 ， 责 罚 ， 凌 辱 的 日 子 ， 就 如 妇 人 将 要 生 产 婴 孩 ， 却 没 有 力 量 生 产 。 [kjv] And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. [bbe] And they said to him, Hezekiah says, This day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame; for the children are ready to come to birth, but there is no strength to give birth to them. 19:4 [hgb] 或 者 耶 和 华 你 的 神 听 见 拉 伯 沙 基 的 一 切 话 ， 就 是 他 主 人 亚 述 王 打 发 他 来 辱 骂 永 生 神 的 话 ， 耶 和 华 你 的 神 听 见 这 话 ， 就 发 斥 责 。 故 此 ， 求 你 为 余 剩 的 民 扬 声 祷 告 。 [kjv] It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left. [bbe] It may be that the Lord your God will give ear to the words of the Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, sent to say evil things against the living God, and will make his words come to nothing: so then make your prayer for the rest of the people. 19:5 [hgb] 希 西 家 王 的 臣 仆 就 去 见 以 赛 亚 。 [kjv] So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. [bbe] So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 19:6 [hgb] 以 赛 亚 对 他 们 说 ， 要 这 样 对 你 们 的 主 人 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 听 见 亚 述 王 的 仆 人 亵 渎 我 的 话 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 [kjv] And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. [bbe] And Isaiah said to them, This is what you are to say to your master: The Lord says, Be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of Assyria have said against me in your hearing. 19:7 [hgb] 我 必 惊 动 （ 原 文 作 使 灵 进 入 ） 他 的 心 ， 他 要 听 见 风 声 就 归 回 本 地 。 我 必 使 他 在 那 里 倒 在 刀 下 。 [kjv] Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. [bbe] See, I will put a spirit into him, and bad news will come to his ears, and he will go back to his land; and there I will have him put to death by the sword. 19:8 [hgb] 拉 伯 沙 基 回 去 ， 正 遇 见 亚 述 王 攻 打 立 拿 ， 原 来 他 早 听 见 亚 述 王 拔 营 离 开 拉 吉 。 [kjv] So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. [bbe] So the Rab-shakeh went back, and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah, for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from Lachish. 19:9 [hgb] 亚 述 王 听 见 人 论 古 实 王 特 哈 加 说 ， 他 出 来 要 与 你 争 战 。 于 是 亚 述 王 又 打 发 使 者 去 见 希 西 家 ， 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， [kjv] And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, [bbe] And when news came to him that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, had made an attack on him, he sent representatives to Hezekiah again, saying, 19:10 [hgb] 你 们 对 犹 大 王 希 西 家 如 此 说 ， 不 要 听 你 所 倚 靠 的 神 欺 哄 你 说 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 必 不 交 在 亚 述 王 的 手 中 。 [kjv] Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. [bbe] This is what you are to say to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom is your faith, give you a false hope, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria. 19:11 [hgb] 你 总 听 说 亚 述 诸 王 向 列 国 所 行 的 ， 乃 是 尽 行 灭 绝 ， 难 道 你 还 能 得 救 吗 ？ [kjv] Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? [bbe] No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, putting them to the curse; and will you be kept safe? 19:12 [hgb] 我 列 祖 所 毁 灭 的 ， 就 是 歌 散 ， 哈 兰 ， 利 色 ， 和 属 提 拉 撒 的 伊 甸 人 ， 这 些 国 的 神 何 曾 拯 救 这 些 国 呢 ？ [kjv] Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar? [bbe] Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 19:13 [hgb] 哈 马 的 王 ， 亚 珥 拔 的 王 ， 西 法 瓦 音 城 的 王 ， 希 拿 ， 和 以 瓦 的 王 都 在 哪 里 呢 ？ [kjv] Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? [bbe] Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the town of Sepharvaim, of Hena and of Ivvah? 19:14 [hgb] 希 西 家 从 使 者 手 里 接 过 书 信 来 ， 看 完 了 ， 就 上 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 将 书 信 在 耶 和 华 面 前 展 开 。 [kjv] And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. [bbe] And Hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it; and after reading it, Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, opening the letter there before the Lord. 19:15 [hgb] 希 西 家 向 耶 和 华 祷 告 说 ， 坐 在 二 基 路 伯 上 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 你 是 天 下 万 国 的 神 ， 你 曾 创 造 天 地 。 [kjv] And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. [bbe] And Hezekiah made his prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord, the God of Israel, seated between the winged ones, you only are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. 19:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 侧 耳 而 听 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 睁 眼 而 看 。 要 听 西 拿 基 立 打 发 使 者 来 辱 骂 永 生 神 的 话 。 [kjv] LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. [bbe] Let your ear be turned to us, O Lord, and let your eyes be open, O Lord, and see; take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God. 19:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 亚 述 诸 王 果 然 使 列 国 和 列 国 之 地 变 为 荒 凉 ， [kjv] Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, [bbe] Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have made waste the nations and their lands, 19:18 [hgb] 将 列 国 的 神 像 都 扔 在 火 里 。 因 为 它 本 不 是 神 ， 乃 是 人 手 所 造 的 ， 是 木 头 石 头 的 ， 所 以 灭 绝 它 。 [kjv] And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men\u0027s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. [bbe] And have given their gods to the fire; for they were no gods, but wood and stone, the work of men\u0027s hands; so they have given them to destruction. 19:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 阿 ， 现 在 求 你 救 我 们 脱 离 亚 述 王 的 手 ， 使 天 下 万 国 都 知 道 惟 独 你 耶 和 华 是 神 。 [kjv] Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only. [bbe] But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hands, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and only you, O Lord, are God. 19:20 [hgb] 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 以 赛 亚 就 打 发 人 去 见 希 西 家 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 你 既 然 求 我 攻 击 亚 述 王 西 拿 基 立 ， 我 已 听 见 了 。 [kjv] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. [bbe] Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, The prayer which you have made to me against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, has come to my ears. 19:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 论 他 这 样 说 ， 锡 安 的 处 女 藐 视 你 ， 嗤 笑 你 。 耶 路 撒 冷 的 女 子 向 你 摇 头 。 [kjv] This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. [bbe] This is the word which the Lord has said about him: In the eyes of the virgin daughter of Zion you are shamed and laughed at; the daughter of Jerusalem has made sport of you. 19:22 [hgb] 你 辱 骂 谁 。 亵 渎 谁 。 扬 起 声 来 ， 高 举 眼 目 攻 击 谁 呢 ？ 乃 是 攻 击 以 色 列 的 圣 者 。 [kjv] Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. [bbe] Against whom have you said evil and bitter things? against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up? even against the Holy One of Israel. 19:23 [hgb] 你 借 你 的 使 者 辱 骂 主 ， 并 说 ， 我 率 领 许 多 战 车 上 山 顶 ， 到 利 巴 嫩 极 深 之 处 。 我 要 砍 伐 其 中 高 大 的 香 柏 树 和 佳 美 的 松 树 。 我 必 上 极 高 之 处 ， 进 入 肥 田 的 树 林 。 [kjv] By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel. [bbe] You have sent your servants with evil words against the Lord, and have said, With all my war-carriages I have come up to the top of the mountains, to the inmost parts of Lebanon; its tall cedars will be cut down, and the best trees of its woods; I will come up into his highest places, into his thick woods. 19:24 [hgb] 我 已 经 在 外 邦 挖 井 喝 水 。 我 必 用 脚 掌 踏 干 埃 及 的 一 切 河 。 [kjv] I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. [bbe] I have made water-holes and taken their waters, and with my foot I have made all the rivers of Egypt dry. 19:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 早 先 所 作 的 ， 古 时 所 立 的 ， 就 是 现 在 借 你 使 坚 固 城 荒 废 ， 变 为 乱 堆 ， 这 事 你 岂 没 有 听 见 吗 ？ [kjv] Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. [bbe] Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls. 19:26 [hgb] 所 以 其 中 的 居 民 力 量 甚 小 ， 惊 惶 羞 愧 。 他 们 像 野 草 ， 像 青 菜 ， 如 房 顶 上 的 草 ， 又 如 未 长 成 而 枯 干 的 禾 稼 。 [kjv] Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. [bbe] This is why their townsmen had no power, they were broken and put to shame; they were like the grass of the field and the green plant, like grass on the house-tops. 19:27 [hgb] 你 坐 下 ， 你 出 去 ， 你 进 来 ， 你 向 我 发 烈 怒 ， 我 都 知 道 。 [kjv] But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. [bbe] But I have knowledge of your getting up and your resting, of your going out and your coming in. 19:28 [hgb] 因 你 向 我 发 烈 怒 ， 又 因 你 狂 傲 的 话 达 到 我 耳 中 ， 我 就 要 用 钩 子 钩 上 你 的 鼻 子 ， 把 嚼 环 放 在 你 口 里 ， 使 你 从 你 来 的 路 转 回 去 。 [kjv] Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. [bbe] Because your wrath against me and your words of pride have come up to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips, and I will make you go back by the way you came. 19:29 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 哪 ， 我 赐 你 们 一 个 证 据 ， 你 们 今 年 要 吃 自 生 的 ， 明 年 也 要 吃 自 长 的 。 至 于 后 年 ， 你 们 要 耕 种 收 割 ， 栽 植 葡 萄 园 ， 吃 其 中 的 果 子 。 [kjv] And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof. [bbe] And this will be the sign to you: you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself; and in the second year from the produce of the same; and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vine-gardens and take of their fruit. 19:30 [hgb] 犹 大 家 所 逃 脱 余 剩 的 ， 仍 要 往 下 扎 根 ， 向 上 结 果 。 [kjv] And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. [bbe] And those of Judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit. 19:31 [hgb] 必 有 余 剩 的 民 从 耶 路 撒 冷 而 出 。 必 有 逃 脱 的 人 从 锡 安 山 而 来 。 耶 和 华 的 热 心 必 成 就 这 事 。 [kjv] For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this. [bbe] For from Jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out, and those who are still living will go out of Mount Zion: by the fixed purpose of the Lord of armies this will be done. 19:32 [hgb] 所 以 ， 耶 和 华 论 亚 述 王 如 此 说 ， 他 必 不 得 来 到 这 城 ， 也 不 在 这 里 射 箭 ， 不 得 拿 盾 牌 到 城 前 ， 也 不 筑 垒 攻 城 。 [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. [bbe] For this cause the Lord says about the king of Assyria, He will not come into this town, or send an arrow against it; he will not come before it with arms, or put up an earthwork against it; 19:33 [hgb] 他 从 哪 条 路 来 ， 必 从 那 条 路 回 去 ， 必 不 得 来 到 这 城 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. [bbe] By the way he came he will go back, and he will not get into this town, says the Lord. 19:34 [hgb] 因 我 为 自 己 的 缘 故 ， 又 为 我 仆 人 大 卫 的 缘 故 ， 必 保 护 拯 救 这 城 。 [kjv] For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David\u0027s sake. [bbe] For I will keep this town safe, for my honour, and for the honour of my servant David. 19:35 [hgb] 当 夜 ， 耶 和 华 的 使 者 出 去 ， 在 亚 述 营 中 杀 了 十 八 万 五 千 人 。 清 早 有 人 起 来 ， 一 看 ， 都 是 死 尸 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. [bbe] And that night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men; and when the people got up early in the morning, there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies. 19:36 [hgb] 亚 述 王 西 拿 基 立 就 拔 营 回 去 ， 住 在 尼 尼 微 。 [kjv] So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. [bbe] So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, went back to his place at Nineveh. 19:37 [hgb] 一 日 在 他 的 神 尼 斯 洛 庙 里 叩 拜 ， 他 儿 子 亚 得 米 勒 和 沙 利 色 用 刀 杀 了 他 ， 就 逃 到 亚 拉 腊 地 。 他 儿 子 以 撒 哈 顿 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] And it came about, when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword; and they went in flight into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1574.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
