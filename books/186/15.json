And his mother\u0027s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. \n [bbe] He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fifty-two years; his mother\u0027s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. \n 15:3 [hgb] 亚 撒 利 雅 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 效 法 他 父 亲 亚 玛 谢 一 切 所 行 的 。 \n [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done; \n [bbe] And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done. \n 15:4 [hgb] 只 是 丘 坛 还 没 有 废 去 ， 百 姓 仍 在 那 里 献 祭 烧 香 。 \n [kjv] Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places. \n [bbe] But he did not take away the high places, and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places. \n 15:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 降 灾 与 王 ， 使 他 长 大 麻 疯 ， 直 到 死 日 ， 他 就 住 在 别 的 宫 里 。 他 的 儿 子 约 坦 管 理 家 事 ， 治 理 国 民 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king\u0027s son was over the house, judging the people of the land. \n [bbe] And the Lord sent disease on the king and he became a leper, and to the day of his death he was living separately in his private house. And Jotham his son was over his house, judging the people of the land. \n 15:6 [hgb] 亚 撒 利 雅 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 \n [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? \n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? \n 15:7 [hgb] 亚 撒 利 雅 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 儿 子 约 坦 接 续 他 作 王 。 \n [kjv] So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. \n [bbe] And Azariah went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; and Jotham his son became king in his place. \n 15:8 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 利 雅 三 十 八 年 ， 耶 罗 波 安 的 儿 子 撒 迦 利 雅 在 撒 玛 利 亚 作 以 色 列 王 六 个 月 。 \n [kjv] In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. \n [bbe] In the thirty-eighth year of Azaliah, king of Judah, Zechariah, son of Jeroboam, was king over Israel for six months. \n 15:9 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 效 法 他 列 祖 所 行 的 ， 不 离 开 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 。 \n [kjv] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. \n [bbe] And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father had done, not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do. \n 15:10 [hgb] 雅 比 的 儿 子 沙 龙 背 叛 他 ， 在 百 姓 面 前 击 杀 他 ， 篡 了 他 的 位 。 \n [kjv] And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. \n [bbe] And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, made a secret design against him, and, attacking him in Ibleam, put him to death and became king in his place. \n 15:11 [hgb] 撒 迦 利 雅 其 余 的 事 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \n [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. \n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. \n 15:12 [hgb] 这 是 从 前 耶 和 华 应 许 耶 户 说 ， 你 的 子 孙 必 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 直 到 四 代 。 这 话 果 然 应 验 了 。 \n [kjv] This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And so it came to pass. \n [bbe] This was what the Lord had said to Jehu, Your sons to the fourth generation will be kings of Israel. And so it came about. \n 15:13 [hgb] 犹 大 王 乌 西 雅 （ 就 是 亚 撒 利 雅 ） 三 十 九 年 ， 雅 比 的 儿 子 沙 龙 登 基 在 撒 玛 利 亚 作 王 一 个 月 。 \n [kjv] Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria. \n [bbe] Shallum, the son of Jabesh, became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah, king of Judah; and he was ruling in Samaria for the space of one month. \n 15:14 [hgb] 迦 底 的 儿 子 米 拿 现 从 得 撒 上 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 杀 了 雅 比 的 儿 子 沙 龙 ， 篡 了 他 的 位 。 \n [kjv] For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. \n [bbe] Then Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and attacking Shallum, son of Jabesh, in Samaria, put him to death and made himself king in his place. \n 15:15 [hgb] 沙 龙 其 余 的 事 和 他 背 叛 的 情 形 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \n [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. \n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the secret design which he made, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. \n 15:16 [hgb] 那 时 米 拿 现 从 得 撒 起 攻 打 提 斐 萨 和 其 四 境 ， 击 杀 城 中 一 切 的 人 ， 剖 开 其 中 所 有 的 孕 妇 ， 都 因 他 们 没 有 给 他 开 城 。 \n [kjv] Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. \n [bbe] Then Menahem sent destruction on Tappuah and all the people in it, and its limits, from Tirzah, because they would not let him come in; and he had all the women who were with child cut open. \n 15:17 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 利 雅 三 十 九 年 ， 迦 底 的 儿 子 米 拿 现 登 基 ， 在 撒 玛 利 亚 作 以 色 列 王 十 年 。 \n [kjv] In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. \n [bbe] In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadi, became king over Israel, and was ruling in Samaria for ten years. \n 15:18 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 终 身 不 离 开 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 。 \n [kjv] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. \n [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord; he did not keep himself from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do. \n 15:19 [hgb] 亚 述 王 普 勒 来 攻 击 以 色 列 国 ， 米 拿 现 给 他 一 千 他 连 得 银 子 ， 请 普 勒 帮 助 他 坚 定 国 位 。 \n [kjv] And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. \n [bbe] In his day, Pul, the king of Assyria, came up against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that he might let him keep the kingdom. \n 15:20 [hgb] 米 拿 现 向 以 色 列 一 切 大 富 户 索 要 银 子 ， 使 他 们 各 出 五 十 舍 客 勒 ， 就 给 了 亚 述 王 。 于 是 亚 述 王 回 去 ， 不 在 国 中 停 留 。 \n [kjv] And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land. \n [bbe] And Menahem got the money from Israel, from all the men of wealth, fifty silver shekels from every man, to give to the king of Assyria.
