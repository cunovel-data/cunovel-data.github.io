\\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all he did, and his great power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 13:9 [hgb] 约 哈 斯 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 撒 玛 利 亚 。 他 儿 子 约 阿 施 接 续 他 作 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jehoahaz went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria; and Joash his son became king in his place. \\n\\n 13:10 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 阿 施 三 十 七 年 ， 约 哈 斯 的 儿 子 约 阿 施 在 撒 玛 利 亚 登 基 作 以 色 列 王 十 六 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. \\n\\n [bbe] In the thirty-seventh year of the rule of Joash, king of Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for sixteen years. \\n\\n 13:11 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 不 离 开 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 一 切 罪 ， 仍 然 去 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein. \\n\\n [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning away from the sin of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which he did and made Israel do, but he went on with it. \\n\\n 13:12 [hgb] 约 阿 施 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 和 他 与 犹 大 王 亚 玛 谢 争 战 的 勇 力 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all he did, and the force with which he went to war against Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 13:13 [hgb] 约 阿 施 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 耶 罗 波 安 坐 了 他 的 位 。 约 阿 施 与 以 色 列 诸 王 一 同 葬 在 撒 玛 利 亚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And Joash went to rest with his fathers and Jeroboam took his place as king; and Joash was put into the earth in Samaria with the kings of Israel. \\n\\n 13:14 [hgb] 以 利 沙 得 了 必 死 的 病 ， 以 色 列 王 约 阿 施 下 来 看 他 ， 伏 在 他 脸 上 哭 泣 ， 说 ， 我 父 阿 。 我 父 阿 。 以 色 列 的 战 车 马 兵 阿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Elisha became ill with the disease which was the cause of his death: and Joash, king of Israel, came down to him, and weeping over him said, My father, my father, the war-carriages of Israel and its horsemen! \\n\\n 13:15 [hgb] 以 利 沙 对 他 说 ， 你 取 弓 箭 来 。 王 就 取 了 弓 箭 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows: and he took bow and arrows. \\n\\n 13:16 [hgb] 又 对 以 色 列 王 说 ， 你 用 手 拿 弓 。 王 就 用 手 拿 弓 。 以 利 沙 按 手 在 王 的 手 上 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king\u0027s hands. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow: and he put his hand on it; and Elisha put his hands on the king\u0027s hands. \\n\\n 13:17 [hgb] 说 ， 你 开 朝 东 的 窗 户 。 他 就 开 了 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 射 箭 吧 。 他 就 射 箭 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 的 得 胜 箭 ， 就 是 战 胜 亚 兰 人 的 箭 。 因 为 你 必 在 亚 弗 攻 打 亚 兰 人 ， 直 到 灭 尽 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD\u0027s deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said; Let the window be open to the east: and he got it open. Then Elisha said, Let the arrow go; and he let it go. And he said, The Lord\u0027s arrow of salvation, of salvation over Aram; for you will overcome the Aramaeans in Aphek and put an end to them. \\n\\n 13:18 [hgb] 以 利 沙 又 说 ， 取 几 枝 箭 来 。 他 就 取 了 来 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 打 地 吧 。 他 打 了 三 次 ， 便 止 住 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Take the arrows: and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Send them down into the earth; and he did so three times and no more. \\n\\n 13:19 [hgb] 神 人 向 他 发 怒 ， 说 ， 应 当 击 打 五 六 次 ， 就 能 攻 打 亚 兰 人 直 到 灭 尽 。 现 在 只 能 打 败 亚 兰 人 三 次 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the man of God was angry with him and said, If you had done it five or six times, then you would have overcome Aram completely; but now you will only overcome them three times. \\n\\n 13:20 [hgb] 以 利 沙 死 了 ， 人 将 他 葬 埋 。 到 了 新 年 ， 有 一 群 摩 押 人 犯 境 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. \\n\\n [bbe] And death came to Elisha and they put his body into the earth. Now in the spring of the year, armed bands of Moabites frequently came, overrunning the land. \\n\\n 13:21 [hgb] 有 人 正 葬 死 人 ， 忽 然 看 见 一 群 人 ， 就 把 死 人 抛 在 以 利 沙 的 坟 墓 里 ， 一 碰 着 以 利 沙 的 骸 骨 ， 死 人 就 复 活 ， 站 起 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. \\n\\n [bbe] And while they were putting a dead man into the earth, they saw a band coming; and they put the man quickly into the place where Elisha\u0027s body was; and the dead man, on touching Elisha\u0027s bones, came to life again, and got up on his feet. \\n\\n 13:22 [hgb] 约 哈 斯 年 间 ， 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 屡 次 欺 压 以 色 列 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. \\n\\n [bbe] And Israel was crushed under the power of Hazael, king of Aram, all the days of Jehoahaz. \\n\\n 13:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 却 因 与 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 所 立 的 约 ， 仍 施 恩 给 以 色 列 人 ， 怜 恤 他 们 ， 眷 顾 他 们 ， 不 肯 灭 尽 他 们 ， 尚 未 赶 逐 他 们 离 开 自 己 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. \\n\\n [bbe] But the Lord was kind to them and had pity on them, caring for them, because of his agreement with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; he would not put them to destruction or send them away from before his face till now. \\n\\n 13:24 [hgb] 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 死 了 ， 他 儿 子 便 哈 达 接 续 他 作 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Hazael, king of Aram, came to his end; and Ben-hadad his son became king in his place. \\n\\n 13:25 [hgb] 从 前 哈 薛 和 约 阿 施 的 父 亲 约 哈 斯 争 战 ， 攻 取 了 些 城 邑 ， 现 在 约 哈 斯 的 儿 子 约 阿 施 三 次 打 败 哈 薛 的 儿 子 便 哈 达 ， 就 收 回 了 以 色 列 的 城 邑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, took again from Ben-hadad, the son of Hazael, the towns which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. Three times Jehoash overcame him and got back the towns of Israel. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1568.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
