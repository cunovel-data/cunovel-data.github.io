{"id":5775,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"12:1 [hgb] 耶 户 第 七 年 ， 约 阿 施 登 基 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 四 十 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 西 比 亚 ， 是 别 是 巴 人 。 \n [kjv] In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. \n [bbe] In the seventh year of Jehu\u0027s rule, Jehoash became king; and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem; his mother\u0027s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. \n 12:2 [hgb] 约 阿 施 在 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 教 训 他 的 时 候 ， 就 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. \n [bbe] Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all his days, because he was guided by the teaching of Jehoiada the priest. \n 12:3 [hgb] 只 是 丘 坛 还 没 有 废 去 ， 百 姓 仍 在 那 里 献 祭 烧 香 。 \n [kjv] But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. \n [bbe] But the high places were not taken away; the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places. \n 12:4 [hgb] 约 阿 施 对 众 祭 司 说 ， 凡 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 分 别 为 圣 之 物 所 值 通 用 的 银 子 ， 或 各 人 当 纳 的 身 价 ， 或 乐 意 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 银 子 ， \n [kjv] And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man\u0027s heart to bring into the house of the LORD, \n [bbe] And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the holy things, which comes into the house of the Lord, (the amount fixed for every man\u0027s payment,) and all the money given by any man freely from the impulse of his heart, \n 12:5 [hgb] 你 们 当 从 所 认 识 的 人 收 了 来 ， 修 理 殿 的 一 切 破 坏 之 处 。 \n [kjv] Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. \n [bbe] Let the priests take, every man from his friends and neighbours, to make good what is damaged in the house, wherever it is to be seen. \n 12:6 [hgb] 无 奈 到 了 约 阿 施 王 二 十 三 年 ， 祭 司 仍 未 修 理 殿 的 破 坏 之 处 。 \n [kjv] But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. \n [bbe] But in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests had not made good the damaged parts of the house. \n 12:7 [hgb] 所 以 约 阿 施 王 召 了 大 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 和 众 祭 司 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 怎 么 不 修 理 殿 的 破 坏 之 处 呢 ？ 从 今 以 后 ， 你 们 不 要 从 所 认 识 的 人 再 收 银 子 ， 要 将 所 收 的 交 出 来 ， 修 理 殿 的 破 坏 之 处 。 \n [kjv] Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. \n [bbe] Then King Jehoash sent for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why have you not made good what is damaged in the house? now take no more money from your neighbours, but give it for the building up of the house. \n 12:8 [hgb] 众 祭 司 答 应 不 再 收 百 姓 的 银 子 ， 也 不 修 理 殿 的 破 坏 之 处 。 \n [kjv] And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house. \n [bbe] So the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people, and not to make good what was damaged in the house. \n 12:9 [hgb] 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 取 了 一 个 柜 子 ， 在 柜 盖 上 钻 了 一 个 窟 窿 ， 放 于 坛 旁 ， 在 进 耶 和 华 殿 的 右 边 。 守 门 的 祭 司 将 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 一 切 银 子 投 在 柜 里 。 \n [kjv] But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and making a hole in the cover of it, put it by the altar, on the right side when one comes into the house of the Lord; and the priests who kept the door put in it regularly all the money which was taken into the house of the Lord. \n 12:10 [hgb] 他 们 见 柜 里 的 银 子 多 了 ， 便 叫 王 的 书 记 和 大 祭 司 上 来 ， 将 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 银 子 数 算 包 起 来 。 \n [kjv] And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king\u0027s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] And when they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king\u0027s scribe and the high priest came and put it in bags, noting the amount of all the money there was in the house of the Lord. \n 12:11 [hgb] 把 所 平 的 银 子 交 给 督 工 的 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 殿 里 办 事 的 人 。 他 们 把 银 子 转 交 修 理 耶 和 华 殿 的 木 匠 和 工 人 ， \n [kjv] And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, \n [bbe] And the money which was measured out they gave regularly to those who were responsible for overseeing the work, and these gave it in payment to the woodworkers and the builders who were working on the house of the Lord, \n 12:12 [hgb] 并 瓦 匠 ， 石 匠 ， 又 买 木 料 和 凿 成 的 石 头 ， 修 理 耶 和 华 殿 的 破 坏 之 处 ， 以 及 修 理 殿 的 各 样 使 用 。 \n [kjv] And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. \n [bbe] And to the wall-builders and the stone-cutters, and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the Lord, and for everything needed to put the house in good order. \n 12:13 [hgb] 但 那 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 银 子 ， 没 有 用 以 作 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 银 杯 ， 蜡 剪 ， 碗 ， 号 ， 和 别 样 的 金 银 器 皿 ， \n [kjv] Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD: \n [bbe] But the money was not used for making silver cups or scissors or basins or wind-instruments or any vessels of gold or silver for the house of the Lord; \n 12:14 [hgb] 乃 将 那 银 子 交 给 督 工 的 人 修 理 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 \n [kjv] But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] But it was all given to the workmen who were building up the house. \n 12:15 [hgb] 且 将 银 子 交 给 办 事 的 人 转 交 作 工 的 人 ， 不 与 他 们 算 账 ， 因 为 他 们 办 事 诚 实 。 \n [kjv] Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully. \n [bbe] And they did not get any statement of accounts from the men to whom the money was given for the workmen, for they made use of it with good faith. \n 12:16 [hgb] 惟 有 赎 愆 祭 ， 赎 罪 祭 的 银 子 没 有 奉 到 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 都 归 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests\u0027. \n [bbe] The money of the offerings for error and the sin-offerings was not taken into the house of the Lord; it was the priests\u0027. \n 12:17 [hgb] 那 时 ， 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 上 来 攻 打 迦 特 ， 攻 取 了 ， 就 定 意 上 来 攻 打 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \n [kjv] Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. \n [bbe] Then Hazael, king of Aram, went up against Gath and took it; and his purpose was to go up to Jerusalem. \n 12:18 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 阿 施 将 他 列 祖 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 ， 约 兰 ， 亚 哈 谢 所 分 别 为 圣 的 物 和 自 己 所 分 别 为 圣 的 物 ， 并 耶 和 华 殿 与 王 宫 府 库 里 所 有 的 金 子 都 送 给 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 。 哈 薛 就 不 上 耶 路 撒 冷 来 了 。 \n [kjv] And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king\u0027s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem. \n [bbe] Then Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had given to the Lord, together with the things he himself had given, and all the gold in the Temple store and in the king\u0027s house, and sent it to Hazael, king of Aram; and he went away from Jerusalem. \n 12:19 [hgb] 约 阿 施 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 \n [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? \n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \n 12:20 [hgb] 约 阿 施 的 臣 仆 起 来 背 叛 ， 在 下 悉 拉 的 米 罗 宫 那 里 将 他 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. \n [bbe] And his servants made a secret design and put Joash to death at the house of Millo on the way down to Silla. \n 12:21 [hgb] 杀 他 的 那 臣 仆 就 是 示 米 押 的 儿 子 约 撒 甲 和 朔 默 的 儿 子 约 萨 拔 。 众 人 将 他 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 儿 子 亚 玛 谢 接 续 他 作 王 。 \n [kjv] For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. \n [bbe] And Jozacar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, came to him and put him to death; and they put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; and Amaziah his son became king in his place. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1567.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
