And his mother\u0027s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. \\n\\n [bbe] Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, he was ruling in Jerusalem for three months, and his mother\u0027s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. \\n\\n 24:9 [hgb] 约 雅 斤 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 效 法 他 父 亲 一 切 所 行 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. \\n\\n [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father had done. \\n\\n 24:10 [hgb] 那 时 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 的 军 兵 上 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 围 困 城 。 \\n\\n [kjv] At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. \\n\\n [bbe] At that time the armies of Nebuchadnezzar came up to Jerusalem and the town was shut in on every side. \\n\\n 24:11 [hgb] 当 他 军 兵 围 困 城 的 时 候 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 就 亲 自 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it. \\n\\n [bbe] And Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came there, while his servants were shutting in the town; \\n\\n 24:12 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 斤 和 他 母 亲 ， 臣 仆 ， 首 领 ， 太 监 一 同 出 城 ， 投 降 巴 比 伦 王 。 巴 比 伦 王 便 拿 住 他 。 那 时 是 巴 比 伦 王 第 八 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Jehoiachin, king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, with his mother and his servants and his chiefs and his unsexed servants; and in the eighth year of his rule the king of Babylon took him. \\n\\n 24:13 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 将 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 里 的 宝 物 都 拿 去 了 ， 将 以 色 列 王 所 罗 门 所 造 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 金 器 都 毁 坏 了 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king\u0027s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took away all the stored wealth of the Lord\u0027s house, and the goods from the king\u0027s store-house, cutting up all the gold vessels which Solomon, king of Israel, had made in the house of the Lord, as the Lord had said. \\n\\n 24:14 [hgb] 又 将 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 民 和 众 首 领 ， 并 所 有 大 能 的 勇 士 ， 共 一 万 人 ， 连 一 切 木 匠 ， 铁 匠 都 掳 了 去 。 除 了 国 中 极 贫 穷 的 人 以 外 ， 没 有 剩 下 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took away all the people of Jerusalem and all the chiefs and all the men of war, ten thousand prisoners; and all the expert workmen and the metal-workers; only the poorest sort of the people of the land were not taken away. \\n\\n 24:15 [hgb] 并 将 约 雅 斤 和 王 母 ， 后 妃 ， 太 监 ， 与 国 中 的 大 官 ， 都 从 耶 路 撒 冷 掳 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king\u0027s mother, and the king\u0027s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. \\n\\n [bbe] He took Jehoiachin a prisoner to Babylon, with his mother and his wives and his unsexed servants and the great men of the land; he took them all as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon. \\n\\n 24:16 [hgb] 又 将 一 切 勇 士 七 千 人 和 木 匠 ， 铁 匠 一 千 人 ， 都 是 能 上 阵 的 勇 士 ， 全 掳 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the men of war, seven thousand of them, and a thousand expert workmen and metal-workers, all of them strong and able to take up arms, the king of Babylon took away as prisoners into Babylon. \\n\\n 24:17 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 立 约 雅 斤 的 叔 叔 玛 探 雅 代 替 他 作 王 ， 给 玛 探 雅 改 名 叫 西 底 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father\u0027s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father\u0027s brother, king in place of Jehoiachin, changing his name to Zedekiah. \\n\\n 24:18 [hgb] 西 底 家 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 一 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 十 一 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 哈 慕 她 ， 是 立 拿 人 耶 利 米 的 女 儿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
