{"id":5764,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. [bbe] After the death of Ahab, Moab made itself free from the authority of Israel. 1:2 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 在 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 一 日 从 楼 上 的 栏 杆 里 掉 下 来 ， 就 病 了 。 于 是 差 遣 使 者 说 ， 你 们 去 问 以 革 伦 的 神 巴 力 西 卜 ， 我 这 病 能 好 不 能 好 。 [kjv] And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease. [bbe] Now Ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in Samaria, and was ill. And he sent men, and said to them, Put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, about the outcome of my disease, to see if I will get well or not. 1:3 [hgb] 但 耶 和 华 的 使 者 对 提 斯 比 人 以 利 亚 说 ， 你 起 来 ， 去 迎 着 撒 玛 利 亚 王 的 使 者 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 去 问 以 革 伦 神 巴 力 西 卜 ， 岂 因 以 色 列 中 没 有 神 吗 ？ [kjv] But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? [bbe] But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Go now, and, meeting the men sent by the king of Samaria, say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you are going to get directions from Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? 1:4 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 必 不 下 你 所 上 的 床 ， 必 定 要 死 。 以 利 亚 就 去 了 。 [kjv] Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. [bbe] Give ear then to the words of the Lord: You will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you. Then Elijah went away. 1:5 [hgb] 使 者 回 来 见 王 ， 王 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 回 来 呢 ？ [kjv] And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? [bbe] And the men he had sent came back to the king; and he said to them, Why have you come back? 1:6 [hgb] 使 者 回 答 说 ， 有 一 个 人 迎 着 我 们 来 ， 对 我 们 说 ， 你 们 回 去 见 差 你 们 来 的 王 ， 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 差 人 去 问 以 革 伦 神 巴 力 西 卜 ， 岂 因 以 色 列 中 没 有 神 吗 ？ 所 以 你 必 不 下 所 上 的 床 ， 必 定 要 死 。 [kjv] And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. [bbe] And they said to him, On our way we had a meeting with a man who said, Go back to the king who sent you and say to him, The Lord says, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? For this reason, you will not come down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you. 1:7 [hgb] 王 问 他 们 说 ， 迎 着 你 们 来 告 诉 你 们 这 话 的 ， 是 怎 样 的 人 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words? [bbe] And he said to them, What sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you? 1:8 [hgb] 回 答 说 ， 他 身 穿 毛 衣 ， 腰 束 皮 带 。 王 说 ， 这 必 是 提 斯 比 人 以 利 亚 。 [kjv] And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite. [bbe] And they said in answer, He was a man clothed in a coat of hair, with a leather band about his body. Then he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite. 1:9 [hgb] 于 是 ， 王 差 遣 五 十 夫 长 ， 带 领 五 十 人 去 见 以 利 亚 ， 他 就 上 到 以 利 亚 那 里 。 以 利 亚 正 坐 在 山 顶 上 。 五 十 夫 长 对 他 说 ， 神 人 哪 ， 王 吩 咐 你 下 来 。 [kjv] Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down. [bbe] Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill, and said to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down. 1:10 [hgb] 以 利 亚 回 答 说 ， 我 若 是 神 人 ， 愿 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 灭 你 和 你 那 五 十 人 。 于 是 有 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 灭 五 十 夫 长 和 他 那 五 十 人 。 [kjv] And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. [bbe] And Elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men, and put an end to you. Then fire came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men. 1:11 [hgb] 王 第 二 次 差 遣 一 个 五 十 夫 长 ， 带 领 五 十 人 去 见 以 利 亚 。 五 十 夫 长 对 以 利 亚 说 ， 神 人 哪 ， 王 吩 咐 你 快 快 下 来 。 [kjv] Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. [bbe] Then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he said to Elijah, O man of God, the king says, Come down quickly. 1:12 [hgb] 以 利 亚 回 答 说 ， 我 若 是 神 人 ， 愿 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 灭 你 和 你 那 五 十 人 。 于 是 神 的 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 灭 五 十 夫 长 和 他 那 五 十 人 。 [kjv] And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. [bbe] And Elijah in answer said, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men, and put an end to you. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and put an end to him and his fifty men. 1:13 [hgb] 王 第 三 次 差 遣 一 个 五 十 夫 长 ， 带 领 五 十 人 去 。 这 五 十 夫 长 上 去 ， 双 膝 跪 在 以 利 亚 面 前 ， 哀 求 他 说 ， 神 人 哪 ， 愿 我 的 性 命 和 你 这 五 十 个 仆 人 的 性 命 在 你 眼 前 看 为 宝 贵 。 [kjv] And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. [bbe] Then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men; and the third captain of fifty went up, and falling on his knees before Elijah, requesting mercy of him, said, O man of God, let my life and the life of these your fifty servants be of value to you. 1:14 [hgb] 已 经 有 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 灭 前 两 次 来 的 五 十 夫 长 和 他 们 各 自 带 的 五 十 人 。 现 在 愿 我 的 性 命 在 你 眼 前 看 为 宝 贵 。 [kjv] Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. [bbe] For fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; but now let my life be of value in your eyes. 1:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 对 以 利 亚 说 ， 你 同 着 他 下 去 ， 不 要 怕 他 。 以 利 亚 就 起 来 ， 同 着 他 下 去 见 王 ， [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. [bbe] Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, Go down with him; have no fear of him. So he got up and went down with him to the king. 1:16 [hgb] 对 王 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 差 人 去 问 以 革 伦 神 巴 力 西 卜 ， 岂 因 以 色 列 中 没 有 神 可 以 求 问 吗 ？ 所 以 你 必 不 下 所 上 的 床 ， 必 定 要 死 。 [kjv] And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. [bbe] And he said to him, This is the word of the Lord: Because you sent men to put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you. 1:17 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 果 然 死 了 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 借 以 利 亚 所 说 的 话 。 因 他 没 有 儿 子 ， 他 兄 弟 约 兰 接 续 他 作 王 ， 正 在 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 约 兰 第 二 年 。 [kjv] So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. [bbe] So death came to him, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah. And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; because he had no son. 1:18 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 其 余 所 行 的 事 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1556.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
