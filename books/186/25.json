and they built forts against it round about. \\n\\n [bbe] Now in the ninth year of his rule, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came against Jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it, building earthworks all round the town. \\n\\n 25:2 [hgb] 于 是 城 被 围 困 ， 直 到 西 底 家 王 十 一 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. \\n\\n [bbe] And the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. \\n\\n 25:3 [hgb] 四 月 初 九 日 ， 城 里 有 大 饥 荒 ， 甚 至 百 姓 都 没 有 粮 食 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. \\n\\n [bbe] Now on the ninth day of the fourth month, the store of food in the town was almost gone, so that there was no food for the people of the land. \\n\\n 25:4 [hgb] 城 被 攻 破 ， 一 切 兵 丁 就 在 夜 间 从 靠 近 王 园 两 城 中 间 的 门 逃 跑 。 迦 勒 底 人 正 在 四 围 攻 城 ， 王 就 向 亚 拉 巴 逃 走 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king\u0027s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain. \\n\\n [bbe] So an opening was made in the wall of the town, and all the men of war went in flight by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the king\u0027s garden; (now the Chaldaeans were stationed round the town:) and the king went by the way of the Arabah. \\n\\n 25:5 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 的 军 队 追 赶 王 ， 在 耶 利 哥 的 平 原 追 上 他 。 他 的 全 军 都 离 开 他 四 散 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. \\n\\n [bbe] But the Chaldaean army went after the king, and overtook him in the lowlands of Jericho, and all his army went in flight from him in every direction. \\n\\n 25:6 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 人 就 拿 住 王 ， 带 他 到 利 比 拉 巴 比 伦 王 那 里 审 判 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah to be judged. \\n\\n 25:7 [hgb] 在 西 底 家 眼 前 杀 了 他 的 众 子 ， 并 且 剜 了 西 底 家 的 眼 睛 ， 用 铜 链 锁 着 他 ， 带 到 巴 比 伦 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes, and then they put out his eyes, and chaining him with iron bands, took him to Babylon. \\n\\n 25:8 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 十 九 年 五 月 初 七 日 ， 巴 比 伦 王 的 臣 仆 ， 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: \\n\\n [bbe] Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem; \\n\\n 25:9 [hgb] 用 火 焚 烧 耶 和 华 的 殿 和 王 宫 ， 又 焚 烧 耶 路 撒 冷 的 房 屋 ， 就 是 各 大 户 家 的 房 屋 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king\u0027s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man\u0027s house burnt he with fire. \\n\\n [bbe] And he had the house of the Lord and the king\u0027s house and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned with fire; \\n\\n 25:10 [hgb] 跟 从 护 卫 长 迦 勒 底 的 全 军 就 拆 毁 耶 路 撒 冷 四 围 的 城 墙 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about. \\n\\n [bbe] And the walls round Jerusalem were broken down by the Chaldaean army which was with the captain. \\n\\n 25:11 [hgb] 那 时 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 将 城 里 所 剩 下 的 百 姓 ， 并 已 经 投 降 巴 比 伦 王 的 人 ， 以 及 大 众 所 剩 下 的 人 ， 都 掳 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away. \\n\\n [bbe] And the rest of the people who were still in the town, and all those who had given themselves up to the king of Babylon, and all the rest of the workmen, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away as prisoners; \\n\\n 25:12 [hgb] 但 护 卫 长 留 下 些 民 中 最 穷 的 ， 使 他 们 修 理 葡 萄 园 ， 耕 种 田 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen. \\n\\n [bbe] But he let the poorest of the land go on living there, to take care of the vines and the fields. \\n\\n 25:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 殿 的 铜 柱 ， 并 耶 和 华 殿 的 盆 座 和 铜 海 ， 迦 勒 底 人 都 打 碎 了 ， 将 那 铜 运 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon. \\n\\n [bbe] And the brass pillars in the house of the Lord, and the wheeled bases, and the great brass water-vessel in the house of the Lord, were broken up by the Chaldaeans, who took the brass to Babylon. \\n\\n 25:14 [hgb] 又 带 去 锅 ， 铲 子 ， 蜡 剪 ， 调 羹 ， 并 所 用 的 一 切 铜 器 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. \\n\\n [bbe] And the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons, and all the brass vessels used in the Lord\u0027s house, they took away. \\n\\n 25:15 [hgb] 火 鼎 ， 碗 ， 无 论 金 的 银 的 ， 护 卫 长 也 都 带 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away. \\n\\n [bbe] And the fire-trays and the basins; the gold of the gold vessels and the silver of the silver vessels, were all taken away by the captain of the armed men. \\n\\n 25:16 [hgb] 所 罗 门 为 耶 和 华 殿 所 造 的 两 根 铜 柱 ， 一 个 铜 海 ， 和 几 个 盆 座 ， 这 一 切 的 铜 ， 多 得 无 法 可 称 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. \\n\\n [bbe] The two pillars, the great water-vessel and the wheeled bases, which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. \\n\\n 25:17 [hgb] 这 一 根 柱 子 高 十 八 肘 ， 柱 上 有 铜 顶 ， 高 三 肘 。 铜 顶 的 周 围 有 网 子 和 石 榴 ， 都 是 铜 的 。 那 一 根 柱 子 ， 照 此 一 样 ， 也 有 网 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work. \\n\\n [bbe] One of the pillars was eighteen cubits high, with a crown of brass on it; the crown was three cubits high, circled with a network and apples all of brass; and the second pillar had the same. \\n\\n 25:18 [hgb] 护 卫 长 拿 住 大 祭 司 西 莱 雅 ， 副 祭 司 西 番 亚 ， 和 三 个 把 门 的 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: \\n\\n [bbe] And the captain of the armed men took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three door-keepers; \\n\\n 25:19 [hgb] 又 从 城 中 拿 住 一 个 管 理 兵 丁 的 官 （ 或 作 太 监 ） ， 并 在 城 里 所 遇 常 见 王 面 的 五 个 人 和 检 点 国 民 军 长 的 书 记 ， 以 及 城 里 遇 见 的 国 民 六 十 个 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king\u0027s presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city: \\n\\n [bbe] And from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war, and five of the king\u0027s near friends who were in the town, and the scribe of the captain of the army, who was responsible for getting the people of the land together in military order, and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town. \\n\\n 25:20 [hgb] 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 将 这 些 人 带 到 利 比 拉 巴 比 伦 王 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah: \\n\\n [bbe] These Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took with him to the king of Babylon at Riblah. \\n\\n 25:21 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 就 把 他 们 击 杀 在 哈 马 地 的 利 比 拉 。 这 样 ， 犹 大 人 被 掳 去 离 开 本 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken away prisoner from his land. \\n\\n 25:22 [hgb] 至 于 犹 大 国 剩 下 的 民 ， 就 是 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 所 剩 下 的 ， 巴 比 伦 王 立 了 沙 番 的 孙 子 ， 亚 希 甘 的 儿 子 基 大 利 作 他 们 的 省 长 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. \\n\\n [bbe] As for the people who were still living in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, did not take away, he made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler over them. \\n\\n 25:23 [hgb] 众 军 长 和 属 他 们 的 人 听 见 巴 比 伦 王 立 了 基 大 利 作 省 长 ， 于 是 军 长 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 ， 加 利 亚 的 儿 子 约 哈 难 ， 尼 陀 法 人 单 户 蔑 的 儿 子 西 莱 雅 ， 玛 迦 人 的 儿 子 雅 撒 尼 亚 ， 和 属 他 们 的 人 都 到 米 斯 巴 见 基 大 利 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the captains of the armed forces, hearing that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah ruler, came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah; Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah, the son of the Maacathite, came with all their men. \\n\\n 25:24 [hgb] 基 大 利 向 他 们 和 属 他 们 的 人 起 誓 说 ， 你 们 不 必 惧 怕 迦 勒 底 臣 仆 ， 只 管 住 在 这 地 服 事 巴 比 伦 王 ， 就 可 以 得 福 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Gedaliah gave his oath to them and their men, saying, Have no fear because of the servants of the Chaldaeans; go on living in the land under the rule of the king of Babylon, and all will be well. \\n\\n 25:25 [hgb] 七 月 间 ， 宗 室 以 利 沙 玛 的 孙 子 ， 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 带 着 十 个 人 来 ， 杀 了 基 大 利 和 同 他 在 米 斯 巴 的 犹 大 人 与 迦 勒 底 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. \\n\\n [bbe] But in the seventh month, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the king\u0027s seed, came with ten men and made an attack on Gedaliah, causing his death and the death of the Jews and the Chaldaeans who were with him at Mizpah. \\n\\n 25:26 [hgb] 于 是 众 民 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 连 众 军 长 。 因 为 惧 怕 迦 勒 底 人 ， 都 起 身 往 埃 及 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees. \\n\\n [bbe] Then all the people, small and great, and the captains of the forces, got up and went away to Egypt, for fear of the Chaldaeans. \\n\\n 25:27 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 斤 被 掳 后 三 十 七 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 以 未 米 罗 达 元 年 十 二 月 二 十 七 日 ， 使 犹 大 王 约 雅 斤 抬 头 ， 提 他 出 监 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; \\n\\n [bbe] And in the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin, king of Judah, had been taken prisoner, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his rule, took Jehoiachin, king of Judah, out of prison; \\n\\n 25:28 [hgb] 又 对 他 说 恩 言 ， 使 他 的 位 高 过 与 他 一 同 在 巴 比 伦 众 王 的 位 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon; \\n\\n [bbe] And said kind words to him, and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. \\n\\n 25:29 [hgb] 给 他 脱 了 囚 服 。 他 终 身 常 在 巴 比 伦 王 面 前 吃 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life. \\n\\n [bbe] And his prison clothing was changed, and he was a guest at the king\u0027s table every day for the rest of his life. \\n\\n 25:30 [hgb] 王 赐 他 所 需 用 的 食 物 ， 日 日 赐 他 一 分 ， 终 身 都 是 这 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life. \\n\\n [bbe] And for his food, the king gave him a regular amount every day for the rest of his life. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/109/1580.html","bookId":186,"book":{"id":186,"title":"Kings列王记下","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 死 后 ， 摩 押 背 叛 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
