{"id":109392,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\n Two weeks after we landed on Roanoke, Magdy, Enzo, Gretchen and I went for a walk.\n \"Watch where you land,\" Magdy told us. \"There are some big rocks down here.\"\n \"Great,\" Gretchen said. She shined her pocket light - acceptable technology, no computer equipment in it, just an old-fashioned LED - at the ground, looking for a place to land, and then hopped down from the edge of the container wall, aiming for her preferred spot. Enzo and I heard the oof as she landed, and then a bit of cursing.\n \"I told you to watch where you landed,\" Magdy said, shining his light on her.\n \"Shut it, Magdy,\" she said. \"We shouldn\u0027t even be out here. You\u0027re going to get us all in trouble.\"\n \"Yeah, well,\" Magdy said. \"Your words would have more moral authority if you weren\u0027t actually out here with me.\" He flicked his light up off of Gretchen and toward me and Enzo, still up on the container wall. \"You two planning to join us?\"\n \"Will you please stop with the light?\" Enzo said. \"The patrol is going to see it.\"\n \"The patrol is on the other side of the container wall,\" Magdy said. \"Although if you don\u0027t hurry it up, that\u0027s not going to be the case for long. So move it.\" He flicked the light back and forth quickly in Enzo\u0027s face, making an annoying strobe effect. Enzo sighed and slid down off the container wall; I heard the muffled thump a second later. Which left me, feeling suddenly very exposed on the top of the containers that were the defensive perimeter around our little village - and also the frontier beyond which we were not allowed to go at night.\n \"Come on,\" Enzo whispered up to me. He, at least, remembered we weren\u0027t supposed to be out and modulated his voice accordingly. \"Jump down. I\u0027ll catch you.\"\n \"Are you dumb?\" I asked, also in a whispery voice. \"You\u0027ll end up with my shoes in your eye sockets.\"\n \"It was a joke,\" Enzo said.\n \"Fine,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t catch me.\"\n \"Jeez, Zoe,\" Magdy said, in a definite nonwhisper. \"Will you jump already?\"\n I hopped off the container wall, down the three meters or so from the top, and tumbled a little when I landed. Enzo flicked his light on me, and offered me a hand up. I took it and squinted up at him as he pulled me up. Then I flicked my own light over to where Magdy was. \"Jerk,\" I told him.\n Magdy shrugged. \"Come on,\" he said, and started along the perimeter of the wall toward our destination.\n A few minutes later we were all flashing our lights into a hole.\n \"Wow,\" Gretchen said. \"We\u0027ve just broken curfew and risked being accidentally shot by the night guard for this. A hole in the ground. I\u0027m picking our next field trip, Magdy.\"\n Magdy snorted and knelt down into the hole. \"If you actually paid attention to anything, you\u0027d know that this hole has the council in a panic,\" Magdy said. \"Something dug this out the other night while the patrol wasn\u0027t watching. Something was trying to get in to the colony from out here.\" He took his light and moved it up the nearest container until he spotted something. \"Look. There are scratches on the container. Something tried to go over the top, and then when it couldn\u0027t it tried to go under.\"\n \"So what you\u0027re saying is that we\u0027re out here now with a bunch of predators,\" I said.\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be a predator,\" Magdy said. \"Maybe it\u0027s just something that likes to dig.\"\n I flicked my light back up to the claw marks. \"Yeah, that\u0027s a reasonable theory.\"\n \"We couldn\u0027t have seen this during the day?\" Gretchen asked. \"When we could see the things that can leap out and eat us?\"\n Magdy motioned his light over to me. \"Her mom had her security people around it all day long. They weren\u0027t letting anybody else near it. Besides, whatever made this hole is long gone now.\"\n \"I\u0027ll remind you that you said that when something tears out your throat,\" Gretchen said.\n \"Relax,\" Magdy said. \"I\u0027m prepared. And anyway, this hole is just the opening act. My dad is friends with some of the security folks. One of them told him that just before they closed everything up for the night, they saw a herd of those fanties over in the woods. I say we go look.\"\n \"We should get back,\" Enzo said. \"We shouldn\u0027t even be out here, Magdy. If they find us out there, we\u0027re all going to catch hell. We can see the fanties tomorrow. When the sun is up, and we can actually see them.\"\n \"Tomorrow they\u0027ll be awake and foraging,\" Magdy said. \"And there\u0027s no way we\u0027re going to be able to do anything other than look at them through binoculars.\" Magdy pointed at me again. \"Let me remind you that her parents have kept us cooped up for two weeks now, waiting to find out if anything might bruise us on this planet.\"\n \"Or kill us,\" I said. \"Which would be a problem.\"\n Magdy waved this away. \"My point is that if we actually want to see these things - actually get close enough to them that we can get a good look at them - we have to do it now. They\u0027re asleep, no one knows we\u0027re gone, and we\u0027ll be back before anyone misses us.\"\n \"I still think we should go back,\" Enzo said.\n \"Enzo, I know this is taking away from valuable make-out time with your girlfriend,\" Magdy said, \"but I thought you might want to explore something other than Zoe\u0027s tonsils for once.\"\n Magdy was very lucky he wasn\u0027t in arm\u0027s reach when he made that comment. Either my arm or Enzo\u0027s.\n \"You\u0027re being an ass again, Magdy,\" Gretchen said.\n \"Fine,\" Magdy said. \"You guys go back. I\u0027ll see you later. I\u0027m going to see me some fanties.\" He started toward the woods, waving his pocket light in the grass (or grasslike ground cover) as he walked. I shined my light over to Gretchen. She rolled her eyes in exasperation and started walking after Magdy. After a minute Enzo and I followed.\n Take an elephant. Make it just a little smaller. Lose the ears. Make its trunk shorter and tentaclly at the end. Stretch out its legs until it almost but not quite seems impossible that they could support the weight. Give it four eyes. And then do other assorted weird things to its body until it\u0027s not that it looks like an elephant, it\u0027s just that it looks more like an elephant than it looks like anything else you can think of.\n That\u0027s a fantie.\n In the two weeks we\u0027d been trapped in the colony village, waiting for the \"all clear\" to actually begin colonization, the fanties had been spotted several times, either in the woods near the village or just barely in the clearing between the village and the woods. A fantie spotting would bring up a mad rush of children to the colony gate (a gap in the container wall, closed up at night) to look and gawk and wave to the creatures. It would also bring a somewhat more studiously casual wave of us teenagers, because we wanted to see them too, we just didn\u0027t want to seem too interested, since that would mess with our credibility with all our new friends.\n Certainly Magdy never gave any indication of actually caring about the fanties at all. He\u0027d allow himself to be dragged to the gate by Gretchen when a herd passed by, but then he spent most of his time talking to the other guys who were also happy to make it look like they had gotten dragged to the gate. Just goes to show, I suppose. Even the self-consciously cool had a streak of kid in them.\n There was some argument as to whether the fanties we saw were a local group that lived in the area, or whether we\u0027d seen a number of herds that were just migrating through. I had no idea which theory was right; we\u0027d only been on planet for a couple of weeks. And from a distance, all the fanties looked pretty much the same.\n And up close, as we quickly discovered, they smelled horrible.\n \"Does everything on this planet smell like crap?\" Gretchen whispered to me as we glanced up at the fanties. They waved back and forth, ever so slightly, as they slept standing on their legs. As if to answer her question, one of the fanties closest to where we were hiding let rip a monumental fart. We gagged and giggled equally.\n \"Shhhh,\" Enzo said. He and Magdy were crouched behind another tall bush a couple of meters over from us, just short of the clearing where the fantie herd had decided to rest for the night. There were about a dozen of them, all sleeping and farting under the stars. Enzo didn\u0027t seem to be enjoying the visit very much; I think he was worried about us accidentally waking the fanties. This was not a minor concern; fantie legs looked spindly from a distance but up close it was clear they could trample any one of us without too much of a problem, and there were a dozen fanties here. If we woke them up and they panicked, we could end up being pounded into mincemeat.\n I think he was also still a little sore about the \"exploring tonsils\" comment. Magdy, in his usual less-than-charming way, had been digging at Enzo ever since he and I officially started going out. The taunts rose and fell depending on what Magdy\u0027s relationship with Gretchen was at the moment. I was guessing at the moment Gretchen had cut him off. Sometimes I thought I needed a graph or maybe a flow chart to understand how the two of them got along.\n Another one of the fanties let off an epic load of flatulence.\n \"If we stay here any longer, I\u0027m going to suffocate,\" I whispered to Gretchen. She nodded and motioned me to follow her. We snuck over to where Enzo and Magdy were.\n \"Can we go now?\" Gretchen whispered to Magdy. \"I know you\u0027re probably enjoying the smell, but the rest of us are about to lose dinner. And we\u0027ve been gone long enough that someone might start wondering where we went.\"\n \"In a minute,\" Magdy said. \"I want to get closer to one.\"\n \"You\u0027re joking,\" Gretchen said.\n \"We\u0027ve come this far,\" Magdy said.\n \"You really are an idiot sometimes, you know that?\" Gretchen said. \"You don\u0027t just go walking up to a herd of wild animals and say hello. They\u0027ll kill you.\"\n \"They\u0027re asleep,\" Magdy said.\n \"They won\u0027t be if you walk right into the middle of them,\" Gretchen said.\n \"I\u0027m not that stupid,\" Magdy said, his whispered voice becoming louder the more irritated he became. He pointed to the one closest to us. \"I just want to get closer to that one. It\u0027s not going to be a problem. Stop worrying.\"\n Before Gretchen could retort Enzo put his hand up to quiet them both. \"Look,\" he said, and pointed halfway down the clearing. \"One of them is waking up.\"\n \"Oh, wonderful,\" Gretchen said.\n The fantie in question shook its head and then lifted it, spreading the tentacles on its trunk wide. It waved them back and forth.\n \"What\u0027s it doing?\" I asked Enzo. He shrugged. He was no more an expert on fanties than I was.\n It waved its tentacles some more, in a wider arc, and then it came to me what it was doing. It was smelling something. Something that shouldn\u0027t be there.\n The fantie bellowed, not from its trunk like an elephant, but from its mouth. All the other fanties were instantly awake and bellowing, and beginning to move.\n I looked over to Gretchen. Oh, crap, I mouthed. She nodded, and looked back over at the fanties. I looked over at Magdy, who had made himself suddenly very small. I don\u0027t think he wanted to get any closer now.\n The fantie closest to us wheeled about and scraped against the bush we were hiding behind. I heard the thud of its foot as the animal maneuvered itself into a new position. I decided it was time to move but my body overruled me, since it wasn\u0027t giving me control of my legs. I was frozen in place, squatting behind a bush, waiting for my trampling.\n Which never came. A second later the fantie was gone, run off in the same direction as the rest of its herd: away from us.\n Magdy popped up from his crouching position, and listened to the herd rumbling off in the distance. \"All right,\" he said. \"What just happened?\"\n \"I thought they smelled us for sure,\" I said. \"I thought they\u0027d found us.\"\n \"I told you you were an idiot,\" Gretchen said to Magdy. \"If you\u0027d been out there when they woke up, we\u0027d be scooping what was left of you into a bucket.\"\n The two of them started sniping at each other; I turned to look at Enzo, who had turned to face the opposite direction from where the fanties had run. He had his eyes closed but it looked like he was concentrating on something.\n \"What is it?\" I asked.\n He opened his eyes, looked at me, and then pointed in the direction he was facing. \"The breeze is coming from this direction,\" he said.\n \"Okay,\" I said. I wasn\u0027t following him.\n \"Have you ever gone hunting?\" Enzo asked. I shook my head. \"We were upwind of the fanties,\" he said. \"The wind was blowing our scent away from them.\" He pointed to where the first fantie to wake up had been. \"I don\u0027t think that fantie would have smelled us at all.\"\n Click. \"Okay,\" I said. \"Now I get it.\"\n Enzo turned to Magdy and Gretchen. \"Guys,\" he said. \"It\u0027s time to leave. Now.\"\n Magdy flashed his pocket light at Enzo and seemed ready to say something sarcastic, then caught the expression on Enzo\u0027s face in the pocket light\u0027s circle. \"What is it?\"\n \"The fanties didn\u0027t run off because of us,\" Enzo said. \"I think there\u0027s something else out there. Something that hunts the fanties. And I think it\u0027s coming this way.\"\n It\u0027s a cliche of horror entertainments to have teenagers lost in the woods, imagining they\u0027re being chased by something horrible that\u0027s right behind them.\n And now I know why. If you ever want to feel like you\u0027re on the verge of total, abject bowel-releasing terror, try making your way a klick or two out of a forest, at night, with the certain feeling you\u0027re being hunted. It makes you feel alive, it really does, but not in a way you want to feel alive.\n Magdy was in the lead, of course, although whether he was leading because he knew the way back or just because he was running fast enough that the rest of us had to chase him was up for debate. Gretchen and I followed, and Enzo took up the rear. Once I slowed down to check on him and he waved me off. \"Stay with Gretchen,\" he said. Then I realized that he was intentionally staying behind us so whatever might be following us would have to get through him first. I would have kissed him right then if I hadn\u0027t been a quivering mess of adrenaline, desperately running to get home.\n \"Through here,\" Magdy said to us. He pointed at an irregular natural path that I recognized as being the one we used to get into the forest in the first place. I was focusing on getting on that path and then something stepped in behind Gretchen and grabbed me. I screamed.\n There was a bang, followed by a muffled thump, followed by a shout.\n Ezno launched himself at what grabbed at me. A second later he was on the forest floor, Dickory\u0027s knife at his throat. It took me longer than it should have to recognize who it was holding the knife.\n \"Dickory!\" I yelled. \"Stop!\"\n Dickory paused.\n \"Let him go,\" I said. \"He\u0027s no danger to me.\"\n Dickory removed the knife and stepped away from Enzo. Enzo scrambled away from Dickory, and away from me.\n \"Hickory?\" I called. \"Is everything all right?\"\n From ahead, I heard Hickory\u0027s voice. \"Your friend had a handgun. I have disarmed him.\"\n \"He\u0027s choking me!\" Magdy said.\n \"If Hickory wanted to choke you, you wouldn\u0027t be able to talk,\" I yelled back. \"Let him go, Hickory.\"\n \"I am keeping his handgun,\" Hickory said. There was a rustle in the darkness as Magdy picked himself up.\n \"Fine,\" I said. Now that we stopped moving, it was like someone pulled a stopper, and all the adrenaline in my body was falling out from the bottom of my feet. I crouched down to keep from falling over.\n \"No, not fine,\" Magdy said. I saw him emerge out of the gloom, stalking toward me. Dickory interposed itself between me and Magdy. Magdy\u0027s stalking came to a quick halt. \"That\u0027s my dad\u0027s gun. If he finds it missing, I\u0027m dead.\"\n \"What were you doing with the gun in the first place?\" Gretchen asked. She had also come back to where I was standing, Hickory following behind her.\n \"I told you I was prepared,\" Magdy said, and then turned to me. \"You need to tell your bodyguards that they need to be more careful.\" He pointed at Hickory. \"I almost took off that one\u0027s head.\"\n \"Hickory?\" I said.\n \"I was not in any serious danger,\" Hickory said, blandly. His attention seemed elsewhere.\n \"I want my gun back,\" Magdy said. I think he was trying for threatening; he failed when his voice cracked.\n \"Hickory will give you your dad\u0027s gun back when we get back to the village,\" I said. I felt a fatigue headache coming on.\n \"Now,\" Magdy said.\n \"For God\u0027s sake, Magdy,\" I snapped. I was suddenly very tired, and angry. \"Will you please just shut up about your damn gun. You\u0027re lucky you didn\u0027t kill one of us with it. And you\u0027re lucky you didn\u0027t hit one of them\" - I waved at Dickory and then Hickory - \"because then you would be dead, and the rest of us would have to explain how it happened. So just shut up about the stupid gun. Shut up and let\u0027s go home.\"\n Magdy stared at me, then stomped off into the gloom, toward the village. Enzo gave me a strange look and then followed his friend.\n \"Perfect,\" I said, and squeezed my temples with my hands. The monster headache I was on the verge of had arrived, and it was a magnificent specimen.\n \"We should return to the village,\" Hickory said to me.\n \"You think?\" I said, and then stood up and stomped off, away from it and Dickory, back to the village. Gretchen, suddenly left with my two bodyguards for company, was not far behind me.\n \"I don\u0027t want one word of what happened tonight to get back to John and Jane,\" I said to Hickory, as it, Dickory and I stood in the common area of the village. At this time of night there were only a couple of other people who were loitering there, and they quickly disappeared when Hickory and Dickory showed up. Two weeks had not been enough time for people to get used to them. We had the common area to ourselves.\n \"As you say,\" Hickory said.\n \"Thank you,\" I said, and started walking away from them again, toward the tent I shared with my parents.\n \"You should not have been in the woods,\" Hickory said.\n That stopped me. I turned around to face Hickory. \"Excuse me?\" I said.\n \"You should not have been in the woods,\" Hickory said. \"Not without our protection.\"\n \"We had protection,\" I said, and some part of my brain didn\u0027t believe those words had actually come out of my mouth.\n \"Your protection was a handgun wielded by someone who did not know how to use it,\" Hickory said. \"The bullet he fired went into the ground less than thirty centimeters from him. He almost shot himself in the foot. I disarmed him because he was a threat to himself, not to me.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be sure to tell him that,\" I said. \"But it doesn\u0027t matter. I don\u0027t need your permission, Hickory, to do what I please. You and Dickory aren\u0027t my parents. And your treaty doesn\u0027t say you can tell me what to do.\"\n \"You are free to do as you will,\" Hickory said. \"But you took an unnecessary risk to yourself, both by going into the forest and by not informing us of your intent.\"\n \"That didn\u0027t stop you from coming in after me,\" I said. It came out like an accusation, because I was in an accusatory mood.\n \"No,\" Hickory said.\n \"So you took it on yourself to follow me around when I didn\u0027t give you permission to do so,\" I said.\n \"Yes,\" Hickory said.\n \"Don\u0027t do that again,\" I said. \"I know privacy is an alien concept to you, but sometimes I don\u0027t want you around. Can you understand that? You\" - I pointed at Dickory - \"nearly cut my boyfriend\u0027s throat tonight. I know you don\u0027t like him, but that\u0027s a little much.\"\n \"Dickory would not have harmed Enzo,\" Hickory said.\n \"Enzo doesn\u0027t know that,\" I said, and turned back to Dickory. \"And what if he had gotten in a good hit on you? You might have hurt him just to keep him down. I don\u0027t need this kind of protection. And I don\u0027t want it.\"\n Hickory and Dickory stood there silently, soaking up my anger. After a couple of seconds, I got bored with this. \"Well?\" I said.\n \"You were running out of the forest when you came by us,\" Hickory said.\n \"Yeah? So?\" I said. \"We thought we might be being chased by something. Something spooked the fanties we were watching and Enzo thought it might have been a predator or something. It was a false alarm. There was nothing behind us or else it would have caught up with us when you two leaped out of nowhere and scared the crap out of all of us.\"\n \"No,\" Hickory said.\n \"No? You didn\u0027t scare the crap out of us?\" I said. \"I beg to differ.\"\n \"No,\" Hickory said. \"You were being followed.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" I said. \"There was nothing behind us.\"\n \"They were in the trees,\" Hickory said. \"They were pacing you from above. Moving ahead of you. We heard them before we heard you.\"\n I felt weak. \"Them?\" I said.\n \"It is why we took you as soon as we heard you coming,\" Hickory said. \"To protect you.\"\n \"What were they?\" I asked.\n \"We don\u0027t know,\" Hickory said. \"We did not have the time to make any good observation. And we believe your friend\u0027s gunshot scared them off.\"\n \"So it wasn\u0027t necessarily something hunting us,\" I said. \"It could have been anything.\"\n \"Perhaps,\" Hickory said, in that studiously neutral way it had when it didn\u0027t want to disagree with me. \"Whatever they were, they were moving along with you and your group.\"\n \"Guys, I\u0027m tired,\" I said, because I didn\u0027t want to think about any of this anymore, and if I did think about it anymore - about the idea that some pack of creatures was following us in the trees - I might have a collapse right there in the common area. \"Can we have this conversation tomorrow?\"\n \"As you wish, Zoe,\" Hickory said.\n \"Thank you,\" I said, and started shuffling off toward my cot. \"And remember what I said about not telling my parents.\"\n \"We will not tell your parents,\" Hickory said.\n \"And remember what I said about not following me,\" I said. They said nothing to this. I waved at them tiredly and went off to sleep.\n I found Enzo outside his family\u0027s tent the next morning, reading a book.\n \"Wow, a real book,\" I said. \"Who did you kill to get that?\"\n \"I borrowed it from one of the Mennonite kids,\" he said. He showed the spine to me. \"Huckleberry Finn. You heard of it?\"\n \"You\u0027re asking a girl from a planet named Huckleberry if she\u0027s heard of Huckleberry Finn,\" I said. I hoped the incredulous tone of my voice would convey amusement.\n Apparently not. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t make the connection.\" He flipped the book open to where he had been reading.\n \"Listen,\" I said. \"I wanted to thank you. For what you did last night.\"\n Enzo looked up over his book. \"I didn\u0027t do anything last night.\"\n \"You stayed behind Gretchen and me,\" I said. \"You put yourself between us and whatever was following us. I just wanted you to know I appreciated it.\"\n Enzo shrugged. \"Not that there was anything following us after all,\" he said. I thought about telling him about what Hickory told me, but kept it in. \"And when something did come out at you, it was ahead of me. So I wasn\u0027t much help, actually.\"\n \"Yeah, about that,\" I said. \"I wanted to apologize for that. For the thing with Dickory.\" I didn\u0027t really know how to put that. I figured saying Sorry for when my alien bodyguard very nearly took your head off with a knife wouldn\u0027t really go over well.\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" Enzo said.\n \"I do worry about it,\" I said.\n \"Don\u0027t,\" Enzo said. \"Your bodyguard did its job.\" For a second it seemed like Enzo would say something more, but then he cocked his head and looked at me like he was waiting for me to wrap up whatever it was I was doing, so he could get back to his very important book.\n It suddenly occurred to me that Enzo hadn\u0027t written me any poetry since we landed on Roanoke.\n \"Well, okay then,\" I said, lamely. \"I guess I\u0027ll see you a little later, then.\"\n \"Sounds good,\" Enzo said, and then gave me a friendly wave and put his nose into Huck Finn\u0027s business. I walked back to my tent and found Babar inside and went over to him and gave him a hug.\n \"Congratulate me, Babar,\" I said. \"I think I just had my first fight with my boyfriend.\"\n Babar licked my face. That made it a little better. But not much. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zoe-s-tale-old-man-s-war-4/page-13.html","bookId":1561,"book":{"id":1561,"title":"Zoe\u0027s Tale (Old Man\u0027s War #4)","description":"Storyline: \n How do you tell your part in the biggest tale in history?
