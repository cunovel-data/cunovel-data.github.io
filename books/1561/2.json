{"id":109381,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I climbed out onto the roof through my bedroom window and looked back at Hickory. \"Hand me those binoculars,\" I said. It did - and then climbed out the window with me. Since you\u0027ve probably never seen it I\u0027ll have you know it\u0027s a pretty impressive sight to watch an Obin unfold itself to get through a window. Very graceful, with no real analogue to any human movement you might want to describe. The universe, it has aliens in it. And they are.\n (Obin: \"it,\" not \"he\" or \"she.\" Because they\u0027re hermaphrodites. That means male and female sex organs. Go ahead and have your giggle. I\u0027ll wait. Okay, done? Good.)\n Hickory was on the roof with me; Dickory was outside the house, more or less spotting me in case I should trip or feel suddenly despondent, and then fall or leap off the roof. This is their standard practice when I climb out my window: one with me, one on the ground. And they\u0027re obvious about it; when I was a little kid Mom or Dad would see Dickory blow out the door and hang around just below the roof, and then yell up the stairs for me to get back into my room. Having paranoid alien pals has a downside.\n For the record: I\u0027ve never fallen off the roof.\n Well, once. When I was ten. But there were extenuating circumstances. That doesn\u0027t count.\n Anyway, I didn\u0027t have to worry about either John or Jane telling me to get back into the house this time. They stopped doing that when I became a teenager. Besides, they were the reason I was up on the roof in the first place.\n \"There they are,\" I said, and pointed for Hickory\u0027s benefit. Mom and Dad and my green friend were standing in the middle of our sorghum field, a few hundred meters out. I raised my binoculars and they went from being hash marks to being actual people. Green man had his back to me, but he was saying something, because both Jane and John were looking at him intently. There was a rustle at Jane\u0027s feet, and then Babar popped up his head. Mom reached down to scratch him.\n \"I wonder what he\u0027s talking to them about,\" I said.\n \"They\u0027re too far away,\" Hickory said. I turned to it to make a comment along the lines of no kidding, genius. Then I saw the consciousness collar around its neck and was reminded that in addition to providing Hickory and Dickory with sentience - with their idea of who they were - their collars also gave them expanded senses, which were mostly devoted to keeping me out of trouble.\n I was also reminded that their consciousness collars were why they were here in the first place. My father - my biological father - created them for the Obin. I was also reminded that they were why I was here, too. Still here, I mean. Alive.\n But I didn\u0027t go down that road of thought.\n \"I thought those things were useful,\" I said, pointing to the collar.\n Hickory lightly touched the collar. \"The collars do many things,\" it said. \"Enabling us to hear a conversation hundreds of meters away, and in the middle of a grain field, is not one of them.\"\n \"So you\u0027re useless,\" I said.\n Hickory nodded its head. \"As you say,\" it said, in its noncommittal way.\n \"It\u0027s no fun mocking you,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Hickory said.\n And the thing of it was, Hickory really was sorry. It\u0027s not easy being a funny, sarcastic thing when most of who you were depended on a machine you wore around your neck. Generating one\u0027s own prosthetic identity takes more concentration than you might expect. Managing a well-balanced sense of sarcasm above and beyond that is a little much to ask for.\n I reached over and gave Hickory a hug. It was a funny thing. Hickory and Dickory were here for me; to know me, to learn from me, to protect me, and if need be to die for me. And here I was, feeling protective of them, and feeling a little sad for them, too. My father - my biological father - gave them consciousness, something the Obin had lacked and had been searching for, for the entire history of their species.\n But he didn\u0027t make consciousness easy for them.\n Hickory accepted my hug and tentatively touched my head; it can be shy when I\u0027m suddenly demonstrative. I took care not to lay it on too thick with the Obin. If I get too emotional it can mess up their consciousness. They\u0027re sensitive to when I get overwrought. So I backed up and then looked toward my parents again with the binoculars. Now John was saying something, with one of his patented half-cocked smiles. His smile erased when our visitor started talking again.\n \"I wonder who he is,\" I said.\n \"He is General Samuel Rybicki,\" Hickory said.\n This got another glance back from me. \"How do you know that?\" I said.\n \"It is our business to know about who visits you and your family,\" Hickory said, and touched its collar again. \"We queried him the moment he landed. Information about him is in our database. He is a liaison between your Civil Defense Forces and your Department of Colonization. He coordinates the protection of your new colonies.\"\n \"Huckleberry isn\u0027t a new colony,\" I said. It wasn\u0027t; it had been colonized for fifty or sixty years by the time we arrived. More than enough time to flatten out all the scary bumps new colonies face, and for the human population to become too big for invaders to scrape off the planet. Hopefully. \"What do you think he wants from my parents?\" I asked.\n \"We don\u0027t know,\" Hickory said.\n \"He didn\u0027t say anything to you while he was waiting for John and Jane to show up?\" I said.\n \"No,\" Hickory said. \"He kept to himself.\"\n \"Well, sure,\" I said. \"Probably because you scared the crap out of him.\"\n \"He left no feces,\" Hickory said.\n I snorted. \"I sometimes question your alleged lack of humor,\" I said. \"I meant he was too intimidated by you to say anything.\"\n \"We assumed that was why you had us stay with him,\" Hickory said.\n \"Well, yeah,\" I said. \"But if I knew he was a general, maybe I wouldn\u0027t have given him such a hard time.\" I pointed to my parents. \"I don\u0027t want them getting any grief because I thought it would be fun to mess with this guy\u0027s head.\"\n \"I think someone of his rank would not come all this way to be deterred by you,\" Hickory said.\n A list of snappy retorts popped in my head, begging to be used. I ignored them all. \"You think he\u0027s here on some serious mission?\" I asked.\n \"He is a general,\" Hickory said. \"And he is here.\"\n I looked back through the binoculars again. General Rybicki - as I now knew him - had turned just a bit, and I could see his face a little more clearly. He was talking to Jane, but then turned a bit to say something to Dad. I lingered on Mom for a minute. Her face was locked up tight; whatever was going on, she wasn\u0027t very happy about it.\n Mom turned her head a bit and suddenly she was looking directly at me, like she knew I was watching her.\n \"How does she do that?\" I said. When Jane was Special Forces, she had a body that was even more genetically modified than the ones regular soldiers got. But like Dad, when she left the service, she got put into a normal human body. She\u0027s not superhuman anymore. She\u0027s just scary observant. Which is close to the same thing. I didn\u0027t get away with much of anything growing up.\n Her attention turned back to General Rybicki, who was addressing her again. I looked up at Hickory. \"What I want to know is why they\u0027re talking in the sorghum field,\" I said.\n \"General Rybicki asked your parents if there was someplace they could speak in private,\" Hickory said. \"He indicated in particular that he wanted to speak away from Dickory and me.\"\n \"Were you recording when you were with him?\" I asked. Hickory and Dickory had recording devices in their collars that recorded sounds, images and emotional data. Those recordings were sent back to other Obin, so they could experience what it\u0027s like to have quality time with me. Odd? Yes. Intrusive? Sometimes, but not usually. Unless I start thinking about it, and then I focus on the fact that, why yes, an entire alien race got to experience my puberty through the eyes of Hickory and Dickory. There\u0027s nothing like sharing menarche with a billion hermaphrodites. I think it was everyone\u0027s first time.\n \"We were not recording with him,\" Hickory said.\n \"Okay, good,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m recording now,\" Hickory said.\n \"Oh. Well, I\u0027m not sure you should be,\" I said, waving out toward my parents. \"I don\u0027t want them getting in trouble.\"\n \"This is allowed under our treaty with your government,\" Hickory said. \"We\u0027re allowed to record all you allow us to record, and to report everything that we experience. My government knew that General Rybicki had visited the moment Dickory and I sent our data query. If General Rybicki wanted his visit to remain secret, he should have met your parents elsewhere.\"\n I chose not to dwell on the fact that significant portions of my life were subject to treaty negotiation. \"I don\u0027t think he knew you were here,\" I said. \"He seemed surprised when I sicced you on him.\"\n \"His ignorance of us or of the Obin treaty with the Colonial Union is not our problem,\" Hickory said.\n \"I guess not,\" I said, a little out of sorts.\n \"Would you like me to stop recording?\" Hickory asked. I could hear the tremble on the edge of its voice. If I wasn\u0027t careful about how I showed my annoyance I could send Hickory into an emotional cascade. Then it\u0027d have what amounted to a temporary nervous breakdown right there on the roof. That\u0027d be no good. He could fall off and snap his snaky little neck.\n \"It\u0027s fine,\" I said, and I tried to sound more conciliatory than I really felt. \"It\u0027s too late now anyway.\" Hickory visibly relaxed; I held in a sigh and gazed down at my shoes.\n \"They\u0027re coming back to the house,\" Hickory said, and motioned toward my parents. I followed its hand; my parents and General Rybicki were indeed heading back our way. I thought about going back into the house but then I saw Mom look directly at me, again. Yup, she\u0027d seen me earlier. The chances were pretty good she knew we had been up there all that time.\n Dad didn\u0027t look up the entire walk back. He was already lost in thought. When that happened it was like the world collapsing in around him; he didn\u0027t see anything else until he was done dealing with what he was dealing with. I suspected I wouldn\u0027t see much of him tonight.\n As they cleared the sorghum field, General Rybicki stopped and shook Dad\u0027s hand; Mom kept herself out of handshaking distance. Then he headed back toward his floater. Babar, who had followed the three of them into the field, broke off toward the general to get in one last petting. He got it after the general got to the floater, then padded back to the house. The floater opened its door to let the general in.\n The general stopped, looked directly at me, and waved. Before I could think what I was doing, I waved right back.\n \"That was smart,\" I said to myself. The floater, General Rybicki inside, winged off, taking him back where he came from.\n What do you want with us, General? I thought, and surprised myself by thinking \"us.\" But it only made sense. Whatever he wanted with my parents, I was part of it too. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zoe-s-tale-old-man-s-war-4/page-2.html","bookId":1561,"book":{"id":1561,"title":"Zoe\u0027s Tale (Old Man\u0027s War #4)","description":"Storyline: \n How do you tell your part in the biggest tale in history?
