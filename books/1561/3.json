{"id":109382,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"How do you like it here?\" Jane asked me, as we were washing the dishes after dinner. \"On Huckleberry, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"This is not the first time I\u0027ve been asked that today,\" I said, taking the plate she handed me and drying it.\\n\\n This got a slightly raised eyebrow from Mom. \"General Rybicki asked you the question,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Yup,\" I said.\\n\\n \"And what did you tell him?\" Jane asked.\\n\\n \"I told him I liked it just fine,\" I said. I put the dried plate into the cupboard and waited for the next one.\\n\\n Jane was holding on to it. \"But do you?\" she asked.\\n\\n I sighed, only slightly dramatically. \"Okay, I give up,\" I said. \"What\u0027s going on? Both you and Dad were like zombies at dinner tonight. I know you missed it, because you were wrapped up in your own heads, but I spent most of dinner trying to get either of you to talk more than a grunt. Babar was a better conversationalist than either of you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Zoe,\" Jane said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re forgiven,\" I said. \"But I still want to know what\u0027s going on.\" I motioned to Jane\u0027s hand, to remind her I was still waiting on that plate.\\n\\n She handed it over. \"General Rybicki has asked your father and me to be the leaders of a new colony.\"\\n\\n It was my turn to hold on to the plate. \"A new colony.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Jane said.\\n\\n \"As in, \u0027on another planet\u0027 new colony,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Jane.\\n\\n \"Wow,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Jane said. She knew how to get mileage out of a single word.\\n\\n \"Why did he ask you?\" I asked, and resumed drying. \"No offense, Mom. But you\u0027re a constable in a tiny little village. And Dad\u0027s an ombudsman. It\u0027s kind of a leap.\"\\n\\n \"None taken,\" Jane said. \"We had the same question. General Rybicki said that the military experience we had would cross over. John was a major and I was a lieutenant. And whatever other experience we need Rybicki believes we can pick up quickly, before we set foot on the new colony. As for why us, it\u0027s because this isn\u0027t a normal colony. The colonists aren\u0027t from Earth, they\u0027re from ten of the oldest planets in the Colonial Union. A colony of colonists. The first of its kind.\"\\n\\n \"And none of the planets contributing colonists want another planet to have a leadership role,\" I ventured.\\n\\n Jane smiled. \"That\u0027s right,\" she said. \"We\u0027re the compromise candidates. The least objectionable solution.\"\\n\\n \"Got it,\" I said. \"It\u0027s nice to be sort of wanted.\" We continued washing dishes in silence for a few minutes.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t answer my question,\" Jane said, eventually. \"Do you like it here? Do you want to stay on Huckleberry?\"\\n\\n \"I get a vote?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Of course you do,\" Jane said. \"If we take this, it would mean leaving Huckleberry for at least a few standard years while we got the colony up and running. But realistically it would mean leaving here for good. It would mean all of us leaving here for good.\"\\n\\n \"If,\" I said, a little surprised. \"You didn\u0027t say yes.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the sort of decision you make in the middle of a sorghum field,\" Jane said, and looked at me directly. \"It\u0027s not something we can just say yes to. It\u0027s a complicated decision. We\u0027ve been looking over the information all afternoon, seeing what the Colonial Union\u0027s plans are for the colony. And then we have to think about our lives here. Mine, John\u0027s and yours.\"\\n\\n I grinned. \"I have a life here?\" I asked. This was meant as a joke.\\n\\n Jane squashed it. \"Be serious, Zoe,\" she said. The grin left my face. \"We\u0027ve been here for half of your life now. You have friends. You know this place. You have a future here, if you want it. You can have a life here. It\u0027s not something to be lightly tossed aside.\" She plunged her hands into the sink, searching under the soap suds for another dish.\\n\\n I looked at Jane; there was something in her voice. This wasn\u0027t just about me. \"You have a life here,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I do,\" Jane said. \"I like it here. I like our neighbors and our friends. I like being the constable. Our life here suits me.\" She handed me the casserole dish she\u0027d just cleaned. \"Before we came here I spent all my life in the Special Forces. On ships. This is the first world I\u0027ve actually lived on. It\u0027s important to me.\"\\n\\n \"Then why is this a question?\" I said. \"If you don\u0027t want to go, then we shouldn\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I wouldn\u0027t go,\" Jane said. \"I said I have a life here. It\u0027s not the same thing. There are good reasons to do it. And it\u0027s not just my decision to make.\"\\n\\n I dried and put away the casserole dish. \"What does Dad want?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t told me yet,\" Mom said.\\n\\n \"You know what that means,\" I said. \"Dad\u0027s not subtle when there\u0027s something he doesn\u0027t want to do. If he\u0027s taking his time to think about it, he probably wants to do it.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Mom said. She was rinsing off the flatware. \"He\u0027s trying to find a way to tell me what he wants. It might help him if he knew what we wanted first.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said.\\n\\n \"This is why I asked you if you liked it here,\" Jane said, again.\\n\\n I thought about it as I dried the kitchen counter. \"I like it here,\" I said, finally. \"But I don\u0027t know if I want to have a life here.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Jane asked.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not much here here, is there?\" I said. I waved toward the general direction of New Goa. \"The selection of life choices here is limited. There\u0027s farmer, farmer, store owner, and farmer. Maybe a government position like you and Dad.\"\\n\\n \"If we go to this new colony your choices are going to be the same,\" Jane said. \"First wave colonist life isn\u0027t very romantic, Zoe. The focus is on survival, and preparing the new colony for the second wave of colonists. That means farmers and laborers. Outside of a few specialized roles that will already be filled, there\u0027s not much call for anything else.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but at least it would be somewhere new,\" I said. \"There we\u0027d be building a new world. Here we\u0027re just maintaining an old one. Be honest, Mom. It\u0027s kind of slow around these parts. A big day for you is when someone gets into a fistfight. The highlight of Dad\u0027s day is settling a dispute over a goat.\"\\n\\n \"There are worse things,\" Jane said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not asking for open warfare,\" I said. Another joke.\\n\\n And once again, another stomping from Mom. \"It\u0027ll be a brand-new colony world,\" she said. \"They\u0027re the ones most at risk for attack, because they have the fewest people and the least amount of defense from the CDF. You know that as well as anyone.\"\\n\\n I blinked, actually surprised. I did know it as well as anyone. When I was very young - before I was adopted by Jane and John - the planet I lived on (or above, since I was on a space station) was attacked. Omagh. Jane almost never brought it up, because she knew what it did to me to think about it. \"You think that\u0027s what\u0027s going to happen here?\" I asked.\\n\\n Jane must have sensed what was going on in my head. \"No, I don\u0027t,\" she said. \"This is an unusual colony. It\u0027s a test colony in some ways. There will be political pressure for this colony to succeed. That means more and better defenses, among other things. I think we\u0027ll be better defended than most colonies starting out.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good to know,\" I said.\\n\\n \"But an attack could still happen,\" Jane said. \"John and I fought together at Coral. It was one of the first planets humans settled, and it was still attacked. No colony is totally safe. There are other dangers, too. Colonies can get wiped out by local viruses or predators. Bad weather can kill crops. The colonists themselves could be unprepared. Colonizing - real colonizing, not what we\u0027re doing here on Huckleberry - is hard, constant work. Some of the colonists could fail at it and take the rest of the colony with them. There could be bad leaders making bad decisions.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027d have to worry about that last one,\" I said. I was trying to lighten the mood.\\n\\n Jane didn\u0027t take the bait. \"I\u0027m telling you this isn\u0027t without risk,\" she said. \"It\u0027s there. A lot of it. And if we do this, we go in with our eyes open to that risk.\"\\n\\n This was Mom all over. Her sense of humor wasn\u0027t as deprived as Hickory\u0027s and Dickory\u0027s - I can actually make her laugh. But it doesn\u0027t stop her from being one of the most serious people I\u0027ve ever met in my life. When she wants to get your attention about something she thinks is important, she\u0027s going to get it.\\n\\n It\u0027s a good quality to have, but right at the moment it was making me seriously uncomfortable. That was her plan, no doubt.\\n\\n \"Mom, I know,\" I said. \"I know it has risks. I know that a lot of things could go wrong. I know it wouldn\u0027t be easy.\" I waited.\\n\\n \"But,\" Jane said, giving me the prompt she knew I was waiting for.\\n\\n \"But if you and Dad were leading it, I think it\u0027d be worth the risk,\" I said. \"Because I trust you. You wouldn\u0027t take the job if you didn\u0027t think you could handle it. And I know you wouldn\u0027t put me at risk unnecessarily. If you two decided to do it, I would want to go. I would definitely want to go.\"\\n\\n I was suddenly aware that while I was speaking, my hand had drifted to my chest, and was lightly touching the small pendant there: a jade elephant, given to me by Jane. I moved my hand from it, a little embarrassed.\\n\\n \"And no matter what, starting a new colony wouldn\u0027t be boring,\" I said, to finish up, a little lamely.\\n\\n Mom smiled, unplugged the sink and dried her hands. Then she took a step over to me and kissed the top of my head; I was short enough, and she was tall enough, that it was a natural thing for her. \"I\u0027ll let your dad stew on it for a few more hours,\" she said. \"And then I\u0027ll let him know where we stand.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Mom,\" I said.\\n\\n \"And sorry about dinner,\" she said. \"Your dad gets wrapped up in himself sometimes, and I get wrapped up in noticing he\u0027s wrapped up in himself.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said. \"You should just smack him and tell him to snap out of it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll put that on the list for future reference,\" Jane said. She gave me another quick peck and then stepped away. \"Now go do your homework. We haven\u0027t left the planet yet.\" She walked out of the kitchen. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zoe-s-tale-old-man-s-war-4/page-3.html","bookId":1561,"book":{"id":1561,"title":"Zoe\u0027s Tale (Old Man\u0027s War #4)","description":"Storyline: How do you tell your part in the biggest tale in history?
