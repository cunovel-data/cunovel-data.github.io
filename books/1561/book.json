I\u0027m Zoe Boutin Perry: A colonist stranded on a deadly pioneer world. Holy icon to a race of aliens. A player (and a pawn) in a interstellar chess match to save humanity, or to see it fall. Witness to history. Friend. Daughter. Human. Seventeen years old. Everyone on Earth knows the tale I am part of. But you don\u0027t know my tale: How I did what I did - how I did what I had to do - not just to stay alive but to keep you alive, too. All of you. I\u0027m going to tell it to you now, the only way I know how: not straight but true, the whole thing, to try make you feel what I felt: the joy and terror and uncertainty, panic and wonder, despair and hope. Everything that happened, bringing us to Earth, and Earth out of its captivity. All through my eyes. It\u0027s a story you know. But you don\u0027t know it all.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/zoe-s-tale-old-man-s-war-4.jpg","author":"John Scalzi","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":26,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
