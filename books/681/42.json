{"id":35123,"no":42,"title":"SECTION 12.","content":"In the middle of the morning a man came up to him—“Bud” Adams, a younger brother of the “J. P.,” and Jeff Cotton\u0027s assistant. Bud was stocky, red-faced, and reputed to be handy with his fists. So Hal rose up warily when he saw him. “Hey, you,” said Bud. “There\u0027s a telegram at the office for you.” “For me?” “Your name\u0027s Joe Smith, ain\u0027t it?” “Yes.” “Well, that\u0027s what it says.” Hal considered for a moment. There was no one to be telegraphing Joe Smith. It was only a ruse to get him away. “What\u0027s in the telegram?” he asked. “How do I know?” said Bud. “Where is it from?” “I dunno that.” “Well,” said Hal, “you might bring it to me here.” The other\u0027s eyes flew open. This was not a revolt, it was a revolution! “Who the hell\u0027s messenger boy do you think I am?” he demanded. “Don\u0027t the company deliver telegrams?” countered Hal, politely. And Bud stood struggling with his human impulses, while Hal watched him cautiously. But apparently those who had sent the messenger had given him precise instructions; for he controlled his wrath, and turned and strode away. Hal continued his vigil. He had his lunch with him; and was prepared to eat alone—understanding the risk that a man would be running who showed sympathy with him. He was surprised, therefore, when Johannson, the giant Swede, came and sat down by his side. There also came a young Mexican labourer, and a Greek miner. The revolution was spreading! Hal felt sure the company would not let this go on. And sure enough, towards the middle of the afternoon, the tipple-boss came out and beckoned to him. “Come here, you!” And Hal went in. The “weigh-room” was a fairly open place; but at one side was a door into an office. “This way,” said the man. But Hal stopped where he was. “This is where the check-weighman belongs, Mr. Peters.” “But I want to talk to you.” “I can hear you, sir.” Hal was in sight of the men, and he knew that was his only protection. The tipple-boss went back into the office; and a minute later Hal saw what had been intended. The door opened and Alec Stone came out. He stood for a moment looking at his political henchman. Then he came up. “Kid,” he said, in a low voice, “you\u0027re overdoing this. I didn\u0027t intend you to go so far.” “This is not what you intended, Mr. Stone,” answered Hal. The pit-boss came closer yet. “What you looking for, kid? What you expect to get out of this?” Hal\u0027s gaze was unwavering. “Experience,” he replied. “You\u0027re feeling smart, sonny. But you\u0027d better stop and realise what you\u0027re up against. You ain\u0027t going to get away with it, you know; get that through your head—you ain\u0027t going to get away with it. You\u0027d better come in and have a talk with me.” There was a silence. “Don\u0027t you know how it\u0027ll be, Smith? These little fires start up—but we put \u0027em out. We know how to do it, we\u0027ve got the machinery. It\u0027ll all be forgotten in a week or two, and then where\u0027ll you be at? Can\u0027t you see?” As Hal still made no reply, the other\u0027s voice dropped lower. “I understand your position. Just give me a nod, and it\u0027ll be all right. You tell the men that you\u0027ve watched the weights, and that they\u0027re all right. They\u0027ll be satisfied, and you and me can fix it up later.” “Mr. Stone,” said Hal, with intense gravity, “am I correct in the impression that you are offering me a bribe?” In a flash, the man\u0027s self-control vanished. He thrust his huge fist within an inch of Hal\u0027s nose, and uttered a foul oath. But Hal did not remove his nose from the danger-zone, and over the fist a pair of angry brown eyes gazed at the pit-boss. “Mr. Stone, you had better realise this situation. I am in dead earnest about this matter, and I don\u0027t think it will be safe for you to offer me violence.” For a moment or two the man continued to glare at Hal; but it appeared that he, like Bud Adams, had been given instructions. He turned abruptly and strode back into the office. Hal stood for a bit, until he had made sure of his composure. After which he strolled over towards the scales. A difficulty had occurred to him for the first time—that he did not know anything about the working of coal-scales. But he was given no time to learn. The tipple-boss reappeared. “Get out of here, fellow!” said he. “But you invited me in,” remarked Hal, mildly. “Well, now I invite you out again.” And so the protestant resumed his vigil at the mandarin\u0027s palace-gates.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88576.html","bookId":681,"book":{"id":681,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.
