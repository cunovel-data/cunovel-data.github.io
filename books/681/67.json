{"id":35148,"no":67,"title":"SECTION 3.","content":"When Hal spoke, he did not answer Billy Keating\u0027s last remark. He had been listening to a retelling of the North Valley disaster over the telephone; so he was not thinking about his skin, but about a hundred and seven men and boys buried inside a mine. “Mr. Keating,” said he, “are you sure the Gazette will print that story?” “Good Lord!” exclaimed the other. “What am I here for?” “Well, I\u0027ve been disappointed once, you know.” “Yes, but you got into the wrong camp. We\u0027re a poor man\u0027s paper, and this is what we live on.” “There\u0027s no chance of its being \u0027toned down\u0027?” “Not the slightest, I assure you.” “There\u0027s no chance of Peter Harrigan\u0027s suppressing it?” “Peter Harrigan made his attempts on the Gazette long ago, my boy.” “Well,” said Hal, “and now tell me this—will it do the work?” “In what way?” “I mean—in making them open the mine.” Keating considered for a moment. “I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t do much.” Hal looked at him blankly. He had taken it for granted the publication of the facts would force the company to move. But Keating explained that the Gazette read mainly by working-people, and so had comparatively little influence. “We\u0027re an afternoon paper,” he said; “and when people have been reading lies all morning, it\u0027s not easy to make them believe the truth in the afternoon.” “But won\u0027t the story go to other papers—over the country, I mean?” “Yes, we have a press service; but the papers are all like the Gazette—poor man\u0027s papers. If there\u0027s something very raw, and we keep pounding away for a long time, we can make an impression; at least we limit the amount of news the Western press association can suppress. But when it comes to a small matter like sealing up workingmen in a mine, all we can do is to worry the \u0027G. F. C.\u0027 a little.” So Hal was just where he had begun! “I must find some other plan,” he exclaimed. “I don\u0027t see what you can do,” replied the other. There was a pause, while the young miner pondered. “I had thought of going up to Western City and appealing to the editors,” he said, a little uncertainly. “Well, I can tell you about that—you might as well save your car-fare. They wouldn\u0027t touch your story.” “And if I appealed to the Governor?” “In the first place, he probably wouldn\u0027t see you. And if he did, he wouldn\u0027t do anything. He\u0027s not really the Governor, you know; he\u0027s a puppet put up there to fool you. He only moves when Harrigan pulls a string.” “Of course I knew he was Old Peter\u0027s man,” said Hal. “But then”—and he concluded, somewhat lamely, “What can I do?” A smile of pity came upon the reporter\u0027s face. “I can see this is the first time you\u0027ve been up against \u0027big business.\u0027” And then he added, “You\u0027re young! When you\u0027ve had more experience, you\u0027ll leave these problems to older heads!” But Hal failed to get the reporter\u0027s sarcasm. He had heard these exact words in such deadly seriousness from his brother! Besides, he had just come from scenes of horror. “But don\u0027t you see, Mr. Keating?” he exclaimed. “It\u0027s impossible for me to sit still while those men die?” “I don\u0027t know about your sitting still,” said the other. “All I know is that all your moving about isn\u0027t going to do them any good.” Hal turned to Edstrom and MacKellar. “Gentlemen,” he said, “listen to me for a minute.” And there was a note of pleading in his voice—as if he thought they were deliberately refusing to help him! “We\u0027ve got to do something about this. We\u0027ve got to do something! I\u0027m new at the game, as Mr. Keating says; but you aren\u0027t. Put your minds on it, gentlemen, and help me work out a plan!” There was a long silence. “God knows,” said Edstrom, at last. “I\u0027d suggest something if I could.” “And I, too,” said MacKellar. “You\u0027re up against a stone-wall, my boy. The government here is simply a department of the \u0027G. F. C.\u0027 The officials are crooks—company servants, all of them.” “Just a moment now,” said Hal. “Let\u0027s consider. Suppose we had a real government—what steps would we take? We\u0027d carry such a case to the District Attorney, wouldn\u0027t we?” “Yes, no doubt of it,” said MacKellar. “You mentioned him before,” said Hal. “He threatened to prosecute some mine-superintendents for ballot-frauds, you said.” “That was while he was running for election,” said MacKellar. “Oh! I remember what Jeff Cotton said—that he was friendly to the miners in his speeches, and to the companies in his acts.” “That\u0027s the man,” said the other, drily. “Well,” argued Hal, “oughtn\u0027t I go to him, to give him a chance, at least? You can\u0027t tell, he might have a heart inside him.” “It isn\u0027t a heart he needs,” replied MacKellar; “it\u0027s a back-bone.” “But surely I ought to put it up to him! If he won\u0027t do anything, at least I\u0027ll put him on record, and it\u0027ll make another story for you, won\u0027t it, Mr. Keating?” “Yes, that\u0027s true,” admitted the reporter. “What would you ask him to do?” “Why, to lay the matter before the Grand Jury; to bring indictments against the North Valley bosses.” “But that would take a long time; it wouldn\u0027t save the men in the mine.” “What might save them would be the threat of it.” MacKellar put in. “I don\u0027t think any threat of Dick Barker\u0027s would count for that much. The bosses know they could stop him.” “Well, isn\u0027t there somebody else? Shouldn\u0027t I try the courts?” “What courts?” “I don\u0027t know. You tell me.” “Well,” said the Scotchman, “to begin at the bottom, there\u0027s a justice of the peace.” “Who\u0027s he?” “Jim Anderson, a horse-doctor. He\u0027s like any other J.P. you ever knew—he lives on petty graft.” “Is there a higher court?” “Yes, the district court; Judge Denton. He\u0027s the law-partner of Vagleman, counsel for the \u0027G. F. C.\u0027 How far would you expect to get with him?” “I suppose I\u0027m clutching at straws,” said Hal. “But they say that\u0027s what a drowning man does. Anyway, I\u0027m going to see these people, and maybe out of the lot of them I can find one who\u0027ll act. It can\u0027t do any harm!” The three men thought of some harm it might do; they tried to make Hal consider the danger of being slugged Or shot. “They\u0027ll do it!” exclaimed MacKellar. “And no trouble for them—they\u0027ll prove you were stabbed by a drunken Dago, quarrelling over some woman.” But Hal had got his head set; he believed he could put this job through before his enemies had time to lay any plans. Nor would he let any of his friends accompany him; he had something more important for both Edstrom and Keating to do—and as for MacKellar, he could not get about rapidly enough. Hal bade Edstrom go to the post-office and get the registered letter, and proceed at once to change the bills. It was his plan to make out affidavits, and if the officials here would not act, to take the affidavits to the Governor. And for this he would need money. Meantime, he said, let Billy Keating write out the check-weighman story, and in a couple of hours meet him at the American Hotel, to get copies of the affidavits for the Gazette. Hal was still wearing the miner\u0027s clothes he had worn on the night of his arrest in Edstrom\u0027s cabin. But he declined MacKellar\u0027s offer to lend him a business-suit; the old Scotchman\u0027s clothes would not fit him, he knew, and it would be better to make his appeal as a real miner than as a misfit gentleman. These matters being settled, Hal went out upon the street, where Pete Hanun, the breaker of teeth, fell in behind him. The young miner at once broke into a run, and the other followed suit, and so the two of them sped down the street, to the wonder of people on the way. As Hal had had practice as a sprinter, no doubt Pete was glad that the District Attorney\u0027s office was not far away!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88601.html","bookId":681,"book":{"id":681,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.
