{"id":35201,"no":120,"title":"SECTION 32.","content":"He went out to the street, where his brother was pacing up and down in a ferment. The “hardware drummer” had made another effort to start a conversation, and had been told to go to hell—no less! “Well, are you through now?” Edward demanded, taking out his irritation on Hal. “Yes,” replied the other. “I suppose so.” He realised that Edward would not be concerned about Edstrom\u0027s broken arm. “Then, for God\u0027s sake, get some clothes on and let\u0027s have some food.” “All right,” said Hal. But his answer was listless, and the other looked at him sharply. Even by the moonlight Edward could see the lines in the face of his younger brother, and the hollows around his eyes. For the first time he realised how deeply these experiences were cutting into the boy\u0027s soul. “You poor kid!” he exclaimed, with sudden feeling. But Hal did not answer; he did not want sympathy, he did not want anything! Edward made a gesture of despair. “God knows, I don\u0027t know what to do for you!” They started back to the hotel, and on the way Edward cast about in his mind for a harmless subject of conversation. He mentioned that he had foreseen the shutting up of the stores, and had purchased an outfit for his brother. There was no need to thank him, he added grimly; he had no intention of travelling to Western City in company with a hobo. So the young miner had a bath, the first real one in a long time. (Never again would it be possible for ladies to say in Hal Warner\u0027s presence that the poor might at least keep clean!) He had a shave; he trimmed his finger-nails, and brushed his hair, and dressed himself as a gentleman. In spite of himself he found his cheerfulness partly restored. A strange and wonderful sensation—to be dressed once more as a gentleman. He thought of the saying of the old negro, who liked to stub his toe, because it felt so good when it stopped hurting! They went out to find a restaurant, and on the way one last misadventure befell Edward. Hal saw an old miner walking past, and stopped with a cry: “Mike!” He forgot all at once that he was a gentleman; the old miner forgot it also. He stared for one bewildered moment, then he rushed at Hal and seized him in the hug of a mountain grizzly. “My buddy! My buddy!” he cried, and gave Hal a prodigious thump on the back. “By Judas!” And he gave him a thump with the other hand. “Hey! you old son-of-a-gun!” And he gave him a hairy kiss! But in the very midst of these raptures it dawned over him that there was something wrong about his buddy. He drew back, staring. “You got good clothes! You got rich, hey?” Evidently the old fellow had heard no rumour concerning Hal\u0027s secret. “I\u0027ve been doing pretty well,” Hal said. “What you work at, hey?” “I been working at a strike in North Valley.” “What\u0027s that? You make money working at strike?” Hal laughed, but did not explain. “What you working at?” “I work at strike too—all alone strike.” “No job?” “I work two days on railroad. Got busted track up there. Pay me two-twenty-five a day. Then no more job.” “Have you tried the mines?” “What? Me? They got me all right! I go up to San José. Pit-boss say, \u0027Get the hell out of here, you old groucher! You don\u0027t get no more jobs in this district!\u0027” Hal looked Mike over, and saw that his dirty old face was drawn and white, belying the feeble cheerfulness of his words. “We\u0027re going to have something to eat,” he said. “Won\u0027t you come with us?” “Sure thing!” said Mike, with alacrity. “I go easy on grub now.” Hal introduced “Mr. Edward Warner,” who said “How do you do?” He accepted gingerly the calloused paw which the old Slovak held out to him, but he could not keep the look of irritation from his face. His patience was utterly exhausted. He had hoped to find a decent restaurant and have some real food; but now, of course, he could not enjoy anything, with this old gobbler in front of him. They entered an all-night lunch-room, where Hal and Mike ordered cheese-sandwiches and milk, and Edward sat and wondered at his brother\u0027s ability to eat such food. Meantime the two cronies told each other their stories, and Old Mike slapped his knee and cried out with delight over Hal\u0027s exploits. “Oh, you buddy!” he exclaimed; then, to Edward, “Ain\u0027t he a daisy, hey?” And he gave Edward a thump on the shoulder. “By Judas, they don\u0027t beat my buddy!” Mike Sikoria had last been seen by Hal from the window of the North Valley jail, when he had been distributing the copies of Hal\u0027s signature, and Bud Adams had taken him in charge. The mine-guard had marched him into a shed in back of the power-house, where he had found Kauser and Kalovac, two other fellows who had been arrested while helping in the distribution. Mike detailed the experience with his usual animation. “\u0027Hey, Mister Bud,\u0027 I say, \u0027if you going to send me down canyon, I want to get my things.\u0027 \u0027You go to hell for your things,\u0027 says he. And then I say, \u0027Mister Bud, I want to get my time.\u0027 And he says, \u0027I give you plenty time right here!\u0027 And he punch me and throw me over. Then he grab me up\u0027 again and pull me outside, and I see big automobile waiting, and I say, \u0027Holy Judas! I get ride in automobile! Here I am, old fellow fifty-seven years old, never been in automobile ride all my days. I think always I die and never get in automobile ride!\u0027 We go down canyon, and I look round and see them mountains, and feel nice cool wind in my face, and I say, \u0027Bully for you, Mister Bud, I don\u0027t never forget this automobile. I don\u0027t have such good time any day all my life.\u0027 And he say, \u0027Shut your face, you old wop!\u0027 Then we come out on prairie, we go up in Black Hills, and they stop, and say, \u0027Get out here, you sons o\u0027 guns.\u0027 And they leave us there all alone. They say, \u0027You come back again, we catch you and we rip the guts out of you!\u0027 They go away fast, and we got to walk seven hours, us fellers, before we come to a house! But I don\u0027t mind that, I begged some grub, and then I got job mending track; only I don\u0027t find out if you get out of jail, and I think maybe I lose my buddy and never see him no more.” Here the old man stopped, gazing affectionately at Hal. “I write you letter to North Valley, but I don\u0027t hear nothing, and I got to walk all the way on railroad track to look for you.” How was it? Hal wondered. He had encountered naked horror in this coal-country—yet here he was, not entirely glad at the thought of leaving it! He would miss Old Mike Sikoria, his hairy kiss and his grizzly-bear hug! He struck the old man dumb by pressing a twenty-dollar bill into his hand. Also he gave him the address of Edstrom and Mary, and a note to Johann Hartman, who might use him to work among the Slovaks who came down into the town. Hal explained that he had to go back to Western City that night, but that he would never forget his old friend, and would see that he had a good job. He was trying to figure out some occupation for the old man on his father\u0027s country-place. A pet grizzly! Train-time came, and the long line of dark sleepers rolled in by the depot-platform. It was late—after midnight; but, nevertheless, there was Old Mike. He was in awe of Hal now, with his fine clothes and his twenty-dollar bills; but, nevertheless, under stress of his emotion, he gave him one more hug, and one more hairy kiss. “Good-bye, my buddy!” he cried. “You come back, my buddy! I don\u0027t forget my buddy!” And when the train began to move, he waved his ragged cap, and ran along the platform to get a last glimpse, to call a last farewell. When Hal turned into the car, it was with more than a trace of moisture in his eyes. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88654.html","bookId":681,"book":{"id":681,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.
