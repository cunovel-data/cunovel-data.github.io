{"id":35108,"no":27,"title":"SECTION 26.","content":"Hal kept his eye upon his new acquaintance, and perceived that he was talking with others. Before long the man tackled Old Mike; and Mike of course could not refuse an invitation to grumble, though it came from the devil himself. Hal decided that something must be done about it. He consulted his friend Jerry, who, being a radical, might have some touch-stone by which to test the stranger. Jerry sought him out at noon-time, and came back and reported that he was as much in the dark as Hal. Either the man was an agitator, seeking to “start something,” or else he was a detective sent in by the company. There was only one way to find out—which was for some one to talk freely with him, and see what happened to that person! After some hesitation, Hal decided that he would be the victim. It rewakened his love of adventure, which digging in a coal-mine had subdued in him. The mysterious stranger was a new sort of miner, digging into the souls of men; Hal would countermine him, and perhaps blow him up. He could afford the experiment better than some others—better, for example, than little Mrs. David, who had already taken the stranger into her home, and revealed to him the fact that her husband had been a member of the most revolutionary of all miners\u0027 organisations, the South Wales Federation. So next Sunday Hal invited the stranger for another walk. The man showed reluctance—until Hal said that he wanted to talk to him. As they walked up the canyon, Hal began, “I\u0027ve been thinking about what you said of conditions in these camps, and I\u0027ve concluded it would be a good thing if we had a little shaking up here in North Valley.” “Is that so?” said the other. “When I first came here, I used to think the men were grouchy. But now I\u0027ve had a chance to see for myself, and I don\u0027t believe anybody gets a square deal. For one thing, nobody gets full weight in these mines—at least not unless he\u0027s some favourite of the boss. I\u0027m sure of it, for I\u0027ve tried all sorts of experiments with my partner. We\u0027ve loaded a car extra light, and got eighteen hundredweight, and then we\u0027ve loaded one high and solid, so that we\u0027d know it had twice as much in it—but all we ever got was twenty-two and twenty-three. There\u0027s just no way you can get over that—though everybody knows those big cars can be made to hold two or three tons.” “Yes, I suppose they might,” said the other. “And if you get the smallest piece of rock in, you get a \u0027double-O,\u0027 sure as fate; and sometimes they say you got rock in when you didn\u0027t. There\u0027s no law to make them prove it.” “No, I suppose not.” “What it comes to is simply this—they make you think they are paying fifty-five a ton, but they\u0027ve secretly cut you down to thirty-five. And yesterday at the company-store I paid a dollar and a half for a pair of blue overalls that I\u0027d priced in Pedro for sixty cents.” “Well,” said the other, “the company has to haul them up here, you know!” So, gradually, Hal made the discovery that the tables were turned—the mysterious personage was now occupied in holding him at arm\u0027s length! For some reason, Hal\u0027s sudden interest in industrial justice had failed to make an impression. So his career as a detective came to an inglorious end. “Say, man!” he exclaimed “What\u0027s your game, anyhow?” “Game?” said the other, quietly. “How do you mean?” “I mean, what are you here for?” “I\u0027m here for two dollars a day—the same as you, I guess.” Hal began to laugh. “You and I are like a couple of submarines, trying to find each other under water. I think we\u0027d better come to the surface to do our fighting.” The other considered the simile, and seemed to like it. “You come first,” said he. But he did not smile. His quiet blue eyes were fixed on Hal with deadly seriousness. “All right,” said Hal; “my story isn\u0027t very thrilling. I\u0027m not an escaped convict, I\u0027m not a company spy, as you may be thinking. Nor am I a \u0027natural born\u0027 coal-miner. I happen to have a brother and some friends at home who think they know about the coal-industry, and it got on my nerves, and I came to see for myself. That\u0027s all, except that I\u0027ve found things interesting, and want to stay on a while, so I hope you aren\u0027t a \u0027dick\u0027!” The other walked in silence, weighing Hal\u0027s words. “That\u0027s not exactly what you\u0027d call a usual story,” he remarked, at last. “I know,” replied Hal. “The best I can say for it is that it\u0027s true.” “Well,” said the stranger, “I\u0027ll take a chance on it. I have to trust somebody, if I\u0027m ever to get anywhere. I picked you out because I liked your face.” He gave Hal another searching look as he walked. “Your smile isn\u0027t that of a cheat. But you\u0027re young—so let me remind you of the importance of secrecy in this place.” “I\u0027ll keep mum,” said Hal; and the stranger opened a flap inside his shirt, and drew out a letter which certified him to be Thomas Olson, an organiser for the United Mine-Workers, the great national union of the coal-miners!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88561.html","bookId":681,"book":{"id":681,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.
