{"id":35154,"no":73,"title":"SECTION 9.","content":"Billy Keating went out again, saying that he knew a man who might be willing to talk to him on the quiet, and give him some idea what was going to happen to Hal. Meantime Hal and Edstrom sat down to dinner with MacKellar. The family were afraid to use the dining-room of their home, but spread a little table in the upstairs hall. The distress of mind of MacKellar\u0027s wife and daughter was apparent, and this brought home to Hal the terror of life in this coal-country. Here were American women, in an American home, a home with evidences of refinement and culture; yet they felt and acted as if they were Russian conspirators, in terror of Siberia and the knout! The reporter was gone a couple of hours; when he came back, he brought news. “You can prepare for trouble, young fellow.” “Why so?” “Jeff Cotton\u0027s in town.” “How do you know?” “I saw him in an automobile. If he left North Valley at this time, it was for something serious, you may be sure.” “What does he mean to do?” “There\u0027s no telling. He may have you slugged; he may have you run out of town and dumped out in the desert; he may just have you arrested.” Hal considered for a moment. “For slander?” “Or for vagrancy; or on suspicion of having robbed a bank in Texas, or murdered your great-grandmother in Tasmania. The point is, he\u0027ll keep you locked up till this trouble has blown over.” “Well,” said Hal, “I don\u0027t want to be locked up. I want to go up to Western City. I\u0027m waiting for the train.” “You may have to wait till morning,” replied Keating. “There\u0027s been trouble on the railroad—a freight-car broke down and ripped up the track; it\u0027ll be some time before it\u0027s clear.” They discussed this new problem back and forth. MacKellar wanted to get in half a dozen friends and keep guard over Hal during the night; and Hal had about agreed to this idea, when the discussion was given a new turn by a chance remark of Keating\u0027s. “Somebody else is tied up by the railroad accident. The Coal King\u0027s son!” “The Coal King\u0027s son?” echoed Hal. “Young Percy Harrigan. He\u0027s got a private car here—or rather a whole train. Think of it—dining-car, drawing-room car, two whole cars with sleeping apartments! Wouldn\u0027t you like to be a son of the Coal King?” “Has he come on account of the mine-disaster?” “Mine-disaster?” echoed Keating. “I doubt if he\u0027s heard of it. They\u0027ve been on a trip to the Grand Canyon, I was told; there\u0027s a baggage-car with four automobiles.” “Is Old Peter with them?” “No, he\u0027s in New York. Percy\u0027s the host. He\u0027s got one of his automobiles out, and was up in town—two other fellows and some girls.” “Who\u0027s in his party?” “I couldn\u0027t find out. You can see, it might be a story for the Gazette—the Coal King\u0027s son, coming by chance at the moment when a hundred and seven of his serfs are perishing in the mine! If I could only have got him to say a word about the disaster! If I could even have got him to say he didn\u0027t know about it!” “Did you try?” “What am I a reporter for?” “What happened?” “Nothing happened; except that he froze me stiff.” “Where was this?” “On the street. They stopped at a drug-store, and I stepped up. \u0027Is this Mr. Percy Harrigan?\u0027 He was looking into the store, over my head. \u0027I\u0027m a reporter,\u0027 I said, \u0027and I\u0027d like to ask you about the accident up at North Valley.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 he said, in a tone—gee, it makes your blood cold to think of it! \u0027Just a word,\u0027 I pleaded. \u0027I don\u0027t give interviews,\u0027 he answered; and that was all—he continued looking over my head, and everybody else staring in front of them. They had turned to ice at my first word. If ever I felt like a frozen worm!” There was a pause. “Ain\u0027t it wonderful,” reflected Billy, “how quick you can build up an aristocracy! When you looked at that car, the crowd in it and the airs they wore, you\u0027d think they\u0027d been running the world since the time of William the Conqueror. And Old Peter came into this country with a pedlar\u0027s pack on his shoulders!” “We\u0027re hustlers here,” put in MacKellar. “We\u0027ll hustle all the way to hell in a generation more,” said the reporter. Then, after a minute, “Say, but there\u0027s one girl in that bunch that was the real thing! She sure did get me! You know all those fluffy things they do themselves up in—soft and fuzzy, makes you think of spring-time orchards. This one was exactly the colour of apple-blossoms.” “You\u0027re susceptible to the charms of the ladies?” inquired Hal, mildly. “I am,” said the other. “I know it\u0027s all fake, but just the same, it makes my little heart go pit-a-pat. I always want to think they\u0027re as lovely as they look.” Hal\u0027s smile became reminiscent, and he quoted: “Oh Liza-Ann, come out with me, The moon is a-shinin\u0027 in the monkey-puzzle tree!” Then he stopped, with a laugh. “Don\u0027t wear your heart on your sleeve, Mr. Keating. She wouldn\u0027t be above taking a peck at it as she passed.” “At me? A worm of a newspaper reporter?” “At you, a man!” laughed Hal. “I wouldn\u0027t want to accuse the lady of posing; but a lady has her role in life, and has to keep her hand in.” There was a pause. The reporter was looking at the young miner with sudden curiosity. “See here,” he remarked, “I\u0027ve been wondering about you. How do you come to know so much about the psychology of the leisure class?” “I used to have money once,” said Hal. “My family\u0027s gone down as quickly as the Harrigans have come up.” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88607.html","bookId":681,"book":{"id":681,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.
