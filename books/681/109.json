{"id":35190,"no":109,"title":"SECTION 21.","content":"Soon after dinner the kidnapped committee arrived, bedraggled in body and weary in soul. They inquired for Johann Hartman, and were sent up to the room, where there followed a painful scene. Eight men and a woman who had ventured an act of heroism and been made the victims of a crime could not easily be persuaded to see their efforts and sacrifices thrown on the dump-heap, nor were they timid in expressing their opinions of those who were betraying them. “You been tryin\u0027 to get us out!” cried Tim Rafferty. “Ever since I can remember you been at my old man to help you—an\u0027 here, when we do what you ask, you throw us down!” “We never asked you to go on strike,” said Moylan. “No, that\u0027s true. You only asked us to pay dues, so you fellows could have fat salaries.” “Our salaries aren\u0027t very fat,” replied the young leader, patiently. “You\u0027d find that out if you investigated.” “Well, whatever they are, they go on, while ours stop. We\u0027re on the streets, we\u0027re done for. Look at us—and most of us has got families, too! I got an old mother an\u0027 a lot of brothers and sisters, an\u0027 my old man done up an\u0027 can\u0027t work. What do you think\u0027s to become of us?” “We\u0027ll help you out a little, Rafferty—” “To hell with you!” cried Tim. “I don\u0027t want your help! When I need charity, I\u0027ll go to the county. They\u0027re another bunch of grafters, but they don\u0027t pretend to be friends to the workin\u0027 man.” Here was the thing Tom Olson had told Hal at the outset—the workingmen bedevilled, not knowing whom to trust, suspecting the very people who most desired to help them. “Tim,” he put in, “there\u0027s no use talking like that. We have to learn patience—” And the boy turned upon Hal. “What do you know about it? It\u0027s all a joke to you. You can go off and forget it when you get ready. You\u0027ve got money, they tell me!” Hal felt no resentment at this; it was what he heard from his own conscience. “It isn\u0027t so easy for me as you think, Tim. There are other ways of suffering besides not having money—” “Much sufferin\u0027 you\u0027ll do—with your rich folks!” sneered Tim. There was a murmur of protest from others of the committee. “Good God, Rafferty!” broke in Moylan. “We can\u0027t help it, man—we\u0027re just as helpless as you!” “You say you\u0027re helpless—but you don\u0027t even try!” “Try? Do you want us to back a strike that we know hasn\u0027t a chance? You might as well ask us to lie down and let a load of coal run over us. We can\u0027t win, man! I tell you we can\u0027t win! We\u0027d only be throwing away our organisation!” Moylan became suddenly impassioned. He had seen a dozen sporadic strikes in this district, and many a dozen young strikers, homeless, desolate, embittered, turning their disappointment on him. “We might support you with our funds, you say—we might go on doing it, even while the company ran the mine with scabs. But where would that land us, Rafferty? I seen many a union on the rocks—and I ain\u0027t so old either! If we had a bank, we\u0027d support all the miners of the country, they\u0027d never need to work again till they got their rights. But this money we spend is the money that other miners are earnin\u0027—right now, down in the pits, Rafferty, the same as you and your old man. They give us this money, and they say, \u0027Use it to build up the union. Use it to help the men that aren\u0027t organised—take them in, so they won\u0027t beat down our wages and scab on us. But don\u0027t waste it, for God\u0027s sake; we have to work hard to make it, and if we don\u0027t see results, you\u0027ll get no more out of us.\u0027 Don\u0027t you see how that is, man? And how it weighs on us, worse even then the fear that maybe we\u0027ll lose our poor salaries—though you might refuse to believe anything so good of us? You don\u0027t need to talk to me like I was Peter Harrigan\u0027s son. I was a spragger when I was ten years old, and I ain\u0027t been out of the pits so long that I\u0027ve forgot the feeling. I assure you, the thing that keeps me awake at night ain\u0027t the fear of not gettin\u0027 a living, for I give myself a bit of education, working nights, and I know I could always turn out and earn what I need; but it\u0027s wondering whether I\u0027m spending the miners\u0027 money the best way, whether maybe I mightn\u0027t save them a little misery if I hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 done this or had \u0027a\u0027 done that. When I come down on that sleeper last night, here\u0027s what I was thinking, Tim Rafferty—all the time I listened to the train bumping—\u0027Now I got to see some more of the suffering, I got to let some good men turn against us, because they can\u0027t see why we should get salaries while they get the sack. How am I going to show them that I\u0027m working for them—working as hard as I know how—and that I\u0027m not to blame for their trouble?\u0027” Here Wauchope broke in. “There\u0027s no use talking any more. I see we\u0027re up against it. We\u0027ll not trouble you, Moylan.” “You trouble me,” cried Moylan, “unless you stand by the movement!” The other laughed bitterly. “You\u0027ll never know what I do. It\u0027s the road for me—and you know it!” “Well, wherever you go, it\u0027ll be the same; either you\u0027ll be fighting for the union, or you\u0027ll be a weight that we have to carry.” The young leader turned from one to another of the committee, pleading with them not to be embittered by this failure, but to turn it to their profit, going on with the work of building up the solidarity of the miners. Every man had to make his sacrifices, to pay his part of the price. The thing of importance was that every man who was discharged should be a spark of unionism, carrying the flame of revolt to a new part of the country. Let each one do his part, and there would soon be no place to which the masters could send for “scabs.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88643.html","bookId":681,"book":{"id":681,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps.
