{"id":6384,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"　　ONE MORNING THREE years after I\u0027d moved to New York, I was getting ready for class and listening to the radio. The announcer reported a terrible traffic jam on the New Jersey Turnpike. A van had broken down, spilling clothes and furniture all over the road and creating a big backup. The police were trying to clear the highway, but a dog had jumped out of the van and was running up and down the turnpike as a couple of officers chased after him. The announcer got a lot of mileage out of the story, going on about the rubes with their clunker of a vehicle and yapping dog who were making thousands of New York commuters late for work. 　　That night the psychologist told me I had a phone call. 　　\"Jeannettie-kins!\" It was Mom. \"Guess what?\" she asked in a voice brimming with excitement. \"Your daddy and I have moved to New York!\"The first thing I thought about was the van that had broken down on the turnpike that morning. When I asked Mom about it, she admitted that yes, she and Dad had a teensy bit of technical difficulty with the van. It had popped a belt on some big, crowded highway, and Tinkle, who was sick and tired of being cooped up, you know how that goes, had gotten loose. The police had shown up, and Dad got into an argument with them, and they threatened to arrest him, and gosh it was quite the drama. \"How did you know?\" she asked. 　　\"It was on the radio.\"\"On the radio?\" Mom asked. She couldn\u0027t believe it. \"With everything going on in the world these days, an old van popping a belt is news?\" But there was genuine glee in her voice. \"We only just got here, and we\u0027re already famous!\"After talking to Mom, I looked around my room. It was the maid\u0027s room off the kitchen, and it was tiny, with one narrow window and a bathroom that doubled as a closet. But it was mine. I had a room now, and I had a life, too, and there was no place in either one for Mom and Dad. 　　Still, the next day I went up to Lori\u0027s apartment to see them. Everyone was there. Mom and Dad hugged me. Dad pulled a pint of whiskey out of a paper bag while Mom described their various adventures on the trip. They had gone sightseeing earlier that day, and taken their first ride on the subway, which Dad called a goddamn hole in the ground. Mom said the art deco murals at Rockefeller Center were disappointing, not nearly as good as some of her own paintings. None of us kids was doing much to help carry the conversation. 　　\"So, what\u0027s the plan?\" Brian finally asked. \"You\u0027re moving here?\"\"We have moved,\" Mom said. 　　\"For good?\" I asked. 　　\"That\u0027s right,\" Dad said. 　　\"Why?\" I asked. The question came out sharply. 　　Dad looked puzzled, as if the answer should have been obvious. \"So we could be a family again.\" He raised his pint. \"To the family,\" he said. 　　* * *Mom and Dad found a room in a boardinghouse a few blocks from Lori\u0027s apartment. The steely-haired landlady helped them move in, and a couple of months later, when they fell behind on their rent, she put their belongings on the street and padlocked their room. Mom and Dad moved into a six-story flophouse in a more dilapidated neighborhood. They lasted there a few months, but when Dad set their room on fire by falling asleep with a burning cigarette in his hand, they got kicked out. Brian believed that Mom and Dad needed to be forced to be self-sufficient or they\u0027d be dependent on us forever, so he refused to take them in. But Lori had moved out of the South Bronx and into an apartment in the same building as Brian, and she let them come stay with her and Maureen. It would be for just a week or two, Mom and Dad assured her, a month at the most, while they got a kitty together and looked for a new place. 　　One month at Lori\u0027s became two months and then three and four. Each time I visited, the apartment was more jam-packed. Mom hung paintings on the walls and stacked street finds in the living room and put colored bottles in the windows for that stained-glass effect. The stacks reached the ceiling, and then the living room filled up, and Mom\u0027s collectibles and found art overflowed into the kitchen. 　　But it was Dad who was really getting to Lori. While he hadn\u0027t found steady work, he always had mysterious ways of hustling up pocket money, and he\u0027d come home at night drunk and gunning for an argument. Brian saw that Lori was on the verge of snapping, so he invited Dad to come live with him. He put a lock on the booze cabinet, but Dad had been there under a week when Brian came home and found that Dad had used a screwdriver to take the door off its hinges and then guzzled down every single bottle. 　　Brian didn\u0027t lose his temper. He told Dad he had made a mistake by leaving liquor in the apartment. He said he\u0027d allow Dad to stay, but Dad had to follow some rules, the first being that he stop drinking as long as he was there. \"You\u0027re the king of your own castle, and that\u0027s the way it should be,\" Dad replied. \"But it\u0027ll be a chilly day in hell before I bow to my own son.\" He and Mom still had the white van they\u0027d driven up from West Virginia, and he started sleeping in that. 　　Lori, meanwhile, had given Mom a deadline to clean out the apartment. But the deadline came and went, and so did a second and a third. Also, Dad was always dropping by to visit Mom, but then they got into such screeching arguments that the neighbors banged on the walls. Dad starting fighting with them, too. 　　\"I can\u0027t take it anymore,\" Lori told me one day. 　　\"Maybe you\u0027re just going to have to kick Mom out,\" I said. 　　\"But she\u0027s my mother.\"\"It doesn\u0027t matter. She\u0027s driving you crazy.\"Lori finally agreed. It almost killed her to tell Mom she would have to leave, and she offered to do whatever it took to help her get reestablished, but Mom insisted she\u0027d be fine. 　　\"Lori\u0027s doing the right thing,\" she said to me. \"Sometimes you need a little crisis to get your adrenaline flowing and help you realize your potential.\"Mom and Tinkle moved into the van with Dad. They lived there for a few months, but one day they left it in a no-parking zone and it was towed. Because the van was unregistered, they couldn\u0027t get it back. That night, they slept on a park bench. They were homeless. 　　MOM AND DAD CALLED regularly from pay phones to check up on us, and once or twice a month, we\u0027d all get together at Lori\u0027s. 　　\"It\u0027s not such a bad life,\" Mom told us after they\u0027d been homeless for a couple of months. 　　\"Don\u0027t you worry a lick about us,\" Dad added. \"We\u0027ve always been able to fend for ourselves.\"Mom explained that they\u0027d been busy learning the ropes. They\u0027d visited the various soup kitchens, sampling the cuisines, and had their favorites. They knew which churches passed out sandwiches and when. They\u0027d found the public libraries with good bathrooms where you could wash thoroughly. \"We wash as far down as possible and as far up as possible, but we don\u0027t wash possible,\" was how Mom put it梐nd brush your teeth and shave. They fished newspapers from the trash cans and looked up free events. They went to plays and operas and concerts in the parks, listened to string quartets and piano recitals in office-building lobbies, attended movie screenings, and visited museums. When they first became homeless, it was early summer, and they slept on park benches or in the bushes that lined park paths. Sometimes a cop would wake them up and tell them to move, but they\u0027d just find some other place to sleep. During the day, they\u0027d stash their bedrolls in the underbrush. 　　\"You can\u0027t just live like this,\" I said. 　　\"Why not?\" Mom said. \"Being homeless is an adventure.\"* * *As fall came and the days shortened and the weather cooled, Mom and Dad began spending more time in the libraries, which were warm and comfortable, and some of which remained open well into the evening. Mom was working her way through Balzac. Dad had become interested in chaos theory and was reading Los Alamos Science and the Journal of Statistical Physics. He said it had already helped his pool game. 　　\"What are you going to do when winter comes?\" I asked Mom. 　　She smiled. \"Winter is one of my favorite seasons,\" she said. 　　I didn\u0027t know what to do. Part of me wanted to do whatever I could to take care of Mom and Dad, and part of me just wanted to wash my hands of them. The cold came early that year, and every time I left the psychologist\u0027s apartment, I found myself looking into the faces of the homeless people I passed on the street, wondering each time if one of them would turn out to be Mom or Dad. I usually gave homeless people whatever spare change I had, but I couldn\u0027t help feeling like I was trying to ease my conscience about Mom and Dad wandering the streets while I had a steady job and a warm room to come home to. 　　One day I was walking down Broadway with another student named Carol when I gave some change to a young homeless guy. \"You shouldn\u0027t do that,\" Carol said. 　　\"Why?\"\"It only encourages them. They\u0027re all scam artists.\"What do you know? I wanted to ask. I felt like telling Carol that my parents were out there, too, that she had no idea what it was like to be down on your luck, with nowhere to go and nothing to eat. But that would have meant explaining who I really was, and I wasn\u0027t about to do that. So at the next street corner, I went my way without saying a thing. 　　I knew I should have stood up for Mom and Dad. I\u0027d been pretty scrappy as a kid, and our family had always fought for one another, but back then we\u0027d had no choice. The truth was, I was tired of taking on people who ridiculed us for the way we lived. I just didn\u0027t have it in me to argue Mom and Dad\u0027s case to the world. 　　That was why I didn\u0027t own up to my parents in front of Professor Fuchs. She was one of my favorite teachers, a tiny dark passionate woman with circles under her eyes who taught political science. One day Professor Fuchs asked if homelessness was the result of drug abuse and misguided entitlement programs, as the conservatives claimed, or did it occur, as the liberals argued, because of cuts in social-service programs and the failure to create economic opportunity for the poor? Professor Fuchs called on me. 　　I hesitated. \"Sometimes, I think, it\u0027s neither.\"\"Can you explain yourself?\"\"I think that maybe sometimes people get the lives they want.\"\"Are you saying homeless people want to live on the street?\" Professor Fuchs asked. \"Are you saying they don\u0027t want warm beds and roofs over their heads?\"\"Not exactly,\" I said. I was fumbling for words. \"They do. But if some of them were willing to work hard and make compromises, they might not have ideal lives, but they could make ends meet.\"Professor Fuchs walked around from behind her lectern. \"What do you know about the lives of the underprivileged?\" she asked. She was practically trembling with agitation. \"What do you know about the hardships and obstacles that the underclass faces?\"The other students were staring at me. 　　\"You have a point,\" I said.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/241/503.html","bookId":206,"book":{"id":206,"title":"玻璃城堡 The Glass Castle","description":"简介： The Glass Castle\u0027 is a 2005 memoir by Jeannette Walls.
