{"id":6381,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"　　IN LATE AUGUST, I was washing clothes in the tin pan in the living room when I heard someone coming up the stairs singing. It was Lori. She burst into the living room, duffel bag over her shoulder, laughing and belting out one of those goofy summer-camp songs kids sing at night around the fire. I\u0027d never heard Lori cut loose like this before. She positively glowed as she told me about the hot meals and the hot showers and all the friends she\u0027d made. She\u0027d even had a boyfriend who kissed her. \"Everyone assumed I was a normal person,\" she said. \"It was weird.\" Then she told me that it had occurred to her that if she got out of Welch, and away from the family, she might have a shot at a happy life. From then on, she began looking forward to the day she\u0027d leave Little Hobart Street and be on her own. 　　A few days later, Mom came home. She seemed different, too. She had lived in a dorm on the university campus, without four kids to take care of, and she had loved it. She\u0027d attended lectures and she\u0027d painted. She\u0027d read stacks of self-help books, and they had made her realize that she\u0027d been living her life for other people. She intended to quit her teaching job and devote herself to her art. \"It\u0027s time I did something for myself,\" she said. \"It\u0027s time I started living my life for me.\"\"Mom, you spent the whole summer renewing your certificate.\"\"If I hadn\u0027t done that, I never would have had this breakthrough.\"\"You can\u0027t quit your job,\" I said. \"We need the money.\"\"Why do I always have to be the one who earns the money?\" Mom asked. \"You have a job. You can earn money. Lori can earn money, too. I\u0027ve got more important things to do.\"* * *I thought Mom was having another tantrum. I assumed that come opening day, she\u0027d be off in Lucy Jo\u0027s Dart to Davy Elementary, even if we had to cajole her. But on that first day of school, Mom refused to get out of bed. Lori, Brian, and I pulled back the covers and tried to drag her out, but she wouldn\u0027t budge. 　　I told her she had responsibilities. I told her child welfare might come down on us again if she wasn\u0027t working. She folded her arms across her chest and stared us down. \"I\u0027m not going to school,\" she said. 　　\"Why not?\" I asked. 　　\"I\u0027m sick.\"\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked. 　　\"My mucus is yellow,\" Mom said. 　　\"If everyone who had yellow mucus stayed home, the schools would be pretty empty,\" I told her. 　　Mom\u0027s head snapped up. \"You can\u0027t talk to me like that,\" she said. \"I\u0027m your mother.\"\"If you want to be treated like a mother,\" I said, \"you should act like one.\"Mom rarely got angry. She was usually either singing or crying, but now her face twisted up with fury. We both knew I had crossed a line, but I didn\u0027t care. I\u0027d also changed over the summer. 　　\"How dare you?\" she shouted. \"You\u0027re in trouble now梑ig trouble. I\u0027m telling your dad. Just you wait until he comes home.\"* * *Mom\u0027s threat didn\u0027t worry me. The way I saw it, Dad owed me. I\u0027d looked after his kids all summer, I\u0027d kept him in beer and cigarette money, and I\u0027d helped him fleece that miner Robbie. I figured I had Dad in my back pocket. 　　When I got home from school that afternoon, Mom was still curled up on the sofa bed, a small pile of paperbacks next to her. Dad was sitting at the drafting table, rolling a cigarette. He beckoned to me to follow him into the kitchen. Mom watched us go. 　　Dad closed the door and looked at me gravely. \"Your mother claims you back-talked her.\"\"Yes,\" I said. \"It\u0027s true.\"\"Yes, sir,\" he corrected me, but I didn\u0027t say anything. 　　\"I\u0027m disappointed in you,\" he went on. \"You know damn good and well that you are to respect your parents.\"\"Dad, Mom\u0027s not sick, she\u0027s playing hooky,\" I said. \"She has to take her obligations more seriously. She has to grow up a little.\"\"Who do you think you are?\" he asked. \"She\u0027s your mother.\"\"Then why doesn\u0027t she act like one?\" I looked at Dad for what felt like a very long moment. Then I blurted out. \"And why don\u0027t you act like a dad?\"I could see the blood surge into his face. He grabbed me by the arm. \"You apologize for that comment!\"\"Or what?\" I asked. 　　Dad shoved me up against the wall. \"Or by God I\u0027ll show you who\u0027s boss around here.\"His face was inches from mine. \"What are you going to do to punish me?\" I asked. \"Stop taking me to bars?\"Dad drew back his hand as if to smack me. \"You watch your mouth, young lady. I can still whip your butt, and don\u0027t think I won\u0027t.\"\"You can\u0027t be serious,\" I said. 　　Dad dropped his hand. He pulled his belt out of the loops on his work pants and wrapped it a couple of times around his knuckles. 　　\"Apologize to me and to your mother,\" he said. 　　\"No.\"Dad raised the belt. \"Apologize.\"\"No.\"\"Then bend over.\"Dad was standing between me and the door. There was no way out except through him. But it never occurred to me to either run or fight. The way I saw it, he was in a tighter spot than I was. He had to back down, because if he sided with Mom and gave me a whipping, he would lose me forever. 　　We stared at each other. Dad seemed to be waiting for me to drop my eyes, to apologize and tell him I was wrong so we could go back to being like we were, but I kept holding his gaze. Finally, to call his bluff, I turned around, bent over slightly, and rested my hands on my knees. 　　I expected him to turn and walk away, but there were six stinging blows on the backs of my thighs, each accompanied by a whistle of air. I could feel the welts rising even before I straightened up. 　　* * *I walked out of the kitchen without looking at Dad. Mom was outside the door. She\u0027d been standing there, listening to everything. I didn\u0027t look at her, but I could see from the corner of my eye her triumphant expression. I bit my lip so I wouldn\u0027t cry. 　　As soon as I got outside, I ran up into the woods, pushing tree branches and wild grape vines out of my face. I thought I\u0027d start crying now that I was away from the house, but instead, I threw up. I ate some wild mint to get rid of the taste of bile, and I walked for what felt like hours through the silent hills. The air was clear and cool, and the forest floor was thick with leaves that had fallen from the buckeyes and poplars. Late in the afternoon, I sat down on a tree trunk, leaning forward because the backs of my thighs still stung. All through the long walk, the pain had kept me thinking, and by the time I reached the tree trunk, I had made two decisions. 　　The first was that I\u0027d had my last whipping. No one was ever going to do that to me again. The second was that, like Lori, I was going to get out of Welch. The sooner, the better. Before I finished high school, if I could. I had no idea where I would go, but I did know I was going. I also knew it would not be easy. People got stuck in Welch. I had been counting on Mom and Dad to get us out, but I now knew I had to do it on my own. It would take saving and planning. I decided the next day I\u0027d go to G. C. Murphy and buy a pink plastic piggy bank I\u0027d seen there. I\u0027d put in the seventy-five dollars I had managed to save while working at Becker\u0027s Jewel Box. It would be the beginning of my escape fund. 　　THAT FALL, TWO GUYS showed up in Welch who were different from anyone I\u0027d ever met. They were filmmakers from New York City, and they\u0027d been sent to Welch as part of a government program to bring cultural uplift to rural Appalachia. Their names were Ken Fink and Bob Gross. 　　At first, I thought they were joking. Ken Fink and Bob Gross? As far as I was concerned, they might as well have said their names were Ken Stupid and Bob Ugly. But Ken and Bob weren\u0027t joking. They didn\u0027t think their names were funny at all, and they didn\u0027t smile when I asked if they were putting me on. 　　Ken and Bob both talked so fast梩heir conversation filled with references to people I\u0027d never heard of, like Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allen梩hat it was sometimes hard to follow them. Although they had no sense of humor about their names, Ken and Bob did like to joke a lot. It wasn\u0027t the sort of Welch High humor I was used to桺olack jokes and guys cupping their hand under their armpit to make fart noises. Ken and Bob had this smart, competitive way of joking where one would make a wisecrack and the other would have a comeback and the first would have a retort to the comeback. They could keep it up until my head spun. 　　One weekend Ken and Bob showed a Swedish film in the school auditorium. It was shot in black and white, and had subtitles and a plot heavy on symbolism, so fewer than a dozen people came, even though it was free. Afterward, Lori showed Ken and Bob some of her illustrations. They told her she had talent and said if she was serious about becoming an artist, she needed to go to New York City. It was a place of energy and creativity and intellectual stimulation the likes of which we\u0027d never seen. It was filled with people who, because they were such unique individuals, didn\u0027t fit in anywhere else. 　　That night Lori and I lay in our rope beds and discussed New York City. The things I had heard always made it sound like a big, noisy place with a lot of pollution and mobs of people in suits elbowing one another on the sidewalks. But Lori began to see New York as a sort of Emerald City梩his glowing, bustling place at the end of a long road where she could become the person she was meant to be. 　　What Lori liked most about Ken and Bob\u0027s description was that the city attracted people who were different. Lori was about as different as it was possible to be in Welch. While almost all the other kids wore jeans, Converse sneakers, and T-shirts, she showed up at school in army boots, a white dress with red polka dots, and a jean jacket with dark poetry she\u0027d painted on the back. The other kids threw bars of soap at her, pushed one another into her path, and wrote graffiti about her on the bathroom walls. In return, she cursed them out in Latin. 　　At home she read and painted late into the night, by candlelight or kerosene lamp if the electricity was turned off. She liked Gothic details: mist hanging over a silent lake, gnarled roots heaving up from the earth, a solitary crow in the branches of a bare tree on the shoreline. I thought Lori was amazing, and I had no doubt she would become a successful artist, but only if she could get to New York. I decided I wanted to go there, too, and that winter we came up with a plan. Lori would leave by herself for New York in June, after she graduated. She\u0027d settle in, find a place for us, and I\u0027d follow her as soon as I could. 　　I told Lori about my escape fund, the seventy-five dollars I\u0027d saved. From now on, I said, it would be our joint fund. We\u0027d take on extra work after school and put everything we earned into the piggy bank. Lori could take it to New York and use it to get established, so that by the time I arrived, everything would be set. 　　Lori had always made very good posters, for football rallies, for the plays the drama club put on, and for candidates running for student council. Now she started doing commissioned posters for a dollar-fifty apiece. She was too shy to solicit orders, so I did it for her. Lots of kids at Welch High wanted customized posters to hang on their bedroom walls梠f their boyfriend\u0027s or girlfriend\u0027s name, of their car or their astrological sign or their favorite band. Lori designed the names in big fat overlapping three-dimensional letters like the kind on rock albums, then painted them in Day-Glo colors, outlined in india ink so the letters popped, and surrounded them with stars and dots and squiggly lines that made the letters seem like they were moving. The posters were so good that word of mouth spread, and soon Lori had such a backlog of orders that she was up working until one or two every morning. 　　I made money babysitting and doing other kids\u0027 homework. I did book reports, science essays, and math. I charged a dollar per assignment and guaranteed at least an A?or the customer was entitled to a full refund. After school, I babysat for a dollar an hour and could usually do the homework then. I also tutored kids for two dollars an hour. 　　We told Brian about the escape fund, and he pitched in, even though we hadn\u0027t included him in our plans because he was only in the seventh grade. He mowed lawns or chopped wood or cut hillside weeds with a scythe. He worked after school until the sun went down and all day Saturday and Sunday and came home with his arms and face scratched from the brush he\u0027d cleared. Without looking for thanks or praise, he quietly added his earnings to the pig, which we named Oz. 　　We kept Oz on the old sewing machine in the bedroom. Oz had no plugged hole on the bottom, and the slot on the top was too narrow to work bills out, even if you used a knife, so once you\u0027d put money into Oz, it stayed there. We tested it to make sure. We couldn\u0027t count the money, but because Oz was translucent, we could see our cash accumulating inside when we held him up to the light. 　　* * *One day that winter, when I came home from school, a gold Cadillac Coupe DeVille was parked in front of the house. I wondered if the welfare agency had found some millionaires to be our foster parents and they had arrived to take us away, but Dad was inside the house, twirling a set of keys on his finger. He explained that the Cadillac was the new official Walls family vehicle. Mom was carrying on about how it was one thing to live in a three-room shack with no electricity, since there was a certain dignity in poverty, but to live in a three-room shack and own a gold Cadillac meant you were bona fide poor white trash. 　　\"How\u0027d you get it?\" I asked Dad. 　　\"One helluva good poker hand,\" he said. \"and an even better bluff.\"We\u0027d owned a couple of cars since we\u0027d been in Welch, but they were true buckets of bolts, with shuddering engines and cracked windshields, and as we drove along, we could see the blur of the asphalt through the rusted-out floor panels. Those cars never lasted more than a couple of months, and like the Oldsmobile we\u0027d driven from Phoenix, we never named them, much less got them registered and inspected. The Coupe DeVille actually had an unexpired inspection sticker. It was such a beauty that Dad declared the time had come to revive the tradition of naming our cars. \"That there Caddy,\" he said. \"strikes me as Elvis.\"It crossed my mind that Dad ought to sell Elvis and use the money to install an indoor toilet and buy us all new clothes. The black leather shoes I had bought for fifty cents at the Dollar General Store were held together with safety pins, which I\u0027d tried to blacken with a Magic Marker so you wouldn\u0027t notice them. I\u0027d also used Magic Markers to make colored blotches on my legs that I hoped would camouflage the holes in my pants. I figured that was less noticeable than if I sewed on patches. I had one blue pair and one green pair, so my legs, when I took my pants off, were covered with blue and green spots. 　　But Dad loved Elvis too dearly to consider selling it. And the truth was, I loved Elvis almost as much. Elvis was as long and sleek as a racing yacht. It had air-conditioning, gold shag upholstery, windows that went up and down with the push of a button, and a working turn signal, so Dad didn\u0027t have to stick his arm out. Every time we drove through town in Elvis, I\u0027d nod graciously and smile at the people on the sidewalk, feeling like an heiress. \"You\u0027ve got true noblesse oblige, Mountain Goat,\" Dad would say. 　　Mom grew to love Elvis, too. She hadn\u0027t gone back to teaching and instead spent her time painting, and on the weekends we began to drive to craft fairs all throughout West Virginia: shows where bearded men in overalls played dulcimers and women in granny dresses sold corncob back scratchers and coal sculptures of black bears and miners. We filled Elvis\u0027s trunk with Mom\u0027s paintings and tried to sell them at the fairs. Mom also drew pastel portraits on the spot for anyone willing to pay eighteen dollars, and every now and then she got a commission. 　　We all slept in Elvis on those trips, because a lot of times we made only enough to pay for the gas, or not even that. Still, it felt good to be on the move again. Our trips in Elvis reminded me how easy it was to pick up and move on when the urge struck. Once you\u0027d resolved to go, there was nothing to it at all. 　　AS SPRING APPROACHED and the day of Lori\u0027s graduation drew closer, I lay awake at night, thinking about her life in New York City. \"In exactly three months,\" I said to her, \"you\u0027ll be living in New York.\" The following week, I said. \"In exactly two months and three weeks, you\u0027ll be living in New York.\"\"Would you please shut up,\" she said. 　　\"You\u0027re not nervous, are you?\" I asked. 　　\"What do you think?\"Lori was terrified. She was not sure what she was supposed to do once she got to New York. That had always been the vaguest part of our escape plan. Back in the fall, I\u0027d had no doubt that she could get a scholarship to one of the city\u0027s universities. She\u0027d been a finalist for a National Merit Scholarship, but she\u0027d had to hitchhike into Bluefield to take the test, and she got rattled when the trucker who picked her up put the moves on her; she arrived nearly an hour late and botched the test. 　　Mom, who supported Lori\u0027s New York plans and kept saying she wished she were going to the big city herself, suggested that Lori apply to the Cooper Union art school. Lori put together a portfolio of her drawings and paintings, but just before the submissions deadline, she spilled a pot of coffee on them, which made Mom wonder aloud if Lori had a fear of success. 　　Then Lori heard about a scholarship sponsored by a literary society for the student who created the best work of art inspired by one of the geniuses of the English language. She decided to make a clay bust of Shakespeare. She worked on it for a week, using a sharpened Popsicle stick to shape the slightly bulging eyes and the goatee and earring and longish hair. When it was finished, it looked exactly like Shakespeare. 　　That night we were all sitting at the drafting table watching Lori put the final touches on Shakespeare\u0027s hair when Dad came home drunk. \"That does indeed resemble old Billy,\" Dad said. \"Only thing is, as I been telling you, he was a goddamn fake.\"For years, every time Mom brought out Shakespeare\u0027s plays, Dad would carry on about how they\u0027d been written not by William Shakespeare of Avon but by a bunch of people, including someone named the Earl of Oxford, because no single person in Elizabethan England could have had Shakespeare\u0027s thirty-thousand-word vocabulary. All this bunk about little Billy Shakespeare, Dad would say, the great genius despite his grammar-school education, his small Latin and less Greek, was a lot of sentimental mythology. 　　\"You\u0027re helping perpetuate this fraud,\" he told Lori. 　　\"Dad, it\u0027s just a bust,\" Lori said. 　　\"That\u0027s the problem,\" Dad said. 　　He studied the sculpture, then suddenly reached over and smeared off Shakespeare\u0027s mouth with his thumb. 　　\"What the hell are you doing?\" Lori cried out. 　　\"It\u0027s no longer just a bust,\" Dad said. \"Now it has symbolic value. You can call it Mute Bard.\"\"I spent days on that,\" Lori shouted. \"And you\u0027ve ruined it!\"\"I elevated it,\" Dad said. He told Lori he would help her write a paper that would demonstrate that Shakespeare\u0027s plays had multiple authors, like Rembrandt\u0027s paintings. \"By God, you\u0027ll set the literary world on edge,\" he said. 　　\"I don\u0027t want to set the world on edge!\" Lori screamed. \"I just want to win a stupid little scholarship!\"\"Goddammit, you\u0027re in a horse race, but you\u0027re thinking like a sheep,\" Dad said. \"Sheep don\u0027t win horse races.\"* * *Lori didn\u0027t have the spirit to rework the bust. The next day she smushed the clay into a big glob and left it on the drafting table. I told Lori that if she hadn\u0027t been accepted into an art school by the time she graduated, she should go to New York anyway. She could support herself with the money we\u0027d saved up until she found a job, and then she could apply to a school. That became our new plan. 　　Everyone was mad at Dad, which gave him a case of the sulks. He said he didn\u0027t know why he even bothered to come home anymore, since he no longer got the slightest bit of appreciation for his ideas. He insisted he wasn\u0027t trying to keep Lori from leaving for New York, but if she had the sense that God gave a goose, she would stay put. \"New York is a sorry-ass sinkhole,\" he said more than once. \"filled with faggots and rapists.\" She\u0027d get mugged and find herself on the streets, he warned, forced into prostitution and winding up a drug addict like all those runaway teenagers. \"I\u0027m only telling you this because I love you,\" he said. \"And I don\u0027t want to see you hurt.\"One evening in May, when we\u0027d been saving our money for almost nine months, I came home with a couple of dollars I\u0027d made babysitting and went into the bedroom to stash them in Oz. The pig was not on the old sewing machine. I began looking through all the junk in the bedroom and finally found Oz on the floor. Someone had slashed him apart with a knife and stolen all the money. 　　I knew it was Dad, but at the same time, I couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d stoop this low. Lori obviously didn\u0027t know yet. She was in the living room humming away as she worked on a poster. My first impulse was to hide Oz. I had this wild thought that I could somehow replace the money before Lori discovered it was missing. But I knew how ridiculous that was; three of us had spent the better part of a year accumulating the money. It would be impossible for me to replace it in the month before Lori graduated. 　　I went into the living room and stood beside her, trying to think of what to say. She was working on a poster that said TAMMY! in Day-Glo colors. After a moment, she looked up. \"What?\" she said. 　　Lori could tell by my face that something was wrong. She stood up so abruptly she knocked over a bottle of india ink, and ran into the bedroom. I braced myself, expecting to hear a scream, but there was only silence and then a small, broken whimpering. 　　* * *Lori stayed up all night to confront Dad, but he didn\u0027t come home. She skipped school the following day in case he returned, but Dad was AWOL for three days before we heard him climbing the rickety staircase to the porch. 　　\"You bastard!\" Lori shouted. \"You stole our money!\"\"What the goddamn hell are you talking about?\" Dad asked. \"And watch your language.\" He leaned against the door and lit a cigarette. 　　Lori held up the slashed pig and threw it as hard as she could at Dad, but it was empty and nearly weightless. It struck his shoulder lightly, then bounced to the floor. He bent down carefully, as if the floor beneath him could shift at any moment, picked up our ravaged piggy bank, and turned it over in his hands. \"Someone sure as hell gutted old Oz, didn\u0027t they?\" He turned to me. \"Jeannette, do you know what happened?\"He was actually half grinning at me. After the whipping, Dad had jacked up the charm with me, and even though I was planning to leave, he could make me laugh when he tried, and he still considered me an ally. But now I wanted to knock him over the head. \"You took our money,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what happened.\"\"Well, don\u0027t that beat all,\" Dad said. He started going on about how a man comes home from slaying dragons, trying to keep his family safe, and all he wants in return for his toil and sacrifice is a little love and respect, but it seemed these days that was just too damn much to ask for. He said he didn\u0027t take our New York money, but if Lori was hell-bent on living in that cesspool, he\u0027d finance her trip himself. 　　He reached into his pocket and pulled out a few wadded dollar bills. We just stared at him, so he let the crumpled money fall to the floor. \"Suit yourself,\" he said. 　　\"Why are you doing this to us, Dad?\" I asked. \"Why?\"His face tightened with anger, then he staggered to the sofa bed and passed out. 　　\"I\u0027ll never get out of here,\" Lori kept saying. \"I\u0027ll never get out of here.\"\"You will,\" I said. \"I swear it.\" I believed she would. Because I knew that if Lori never got out of Welch, neither would I. 　　* * *I went back to G. C. Murphy the next day and stared at the shelf of piggy banks. They were all either plastic or porcelain or glass, easily broken. I studied a collection of metal boxes with locks and keys. The hinges were too flimsy. Dad could pry them apart. I bought a blue change purse. I wore it on a belt under my clothes at all times. When it got too full, I put the money in a sock that I hid in a hole in the wall below my bunk. 　　We started saving again, but Lori felt too defeated to paint much, and the money didn\u0027t come as quickly. A week before school was out, we had only $37.20 in the sock. Then one of the women I\u0027d been babysitting for, a teacher named Mrs. Sanders, told me she and her family were moving back to their hometown in Iowa and asked if I wanted to spend the summer with them there. If I came along and helped look after her two toddlers, she said she\u0027d pay me two hundred dollars at the end of the summer and buy me a bus ticket back to Welch. 　　I thought about her offer. \"Take Lori instead of me,\" I said. \"And at the end of the summer, buy her a bus ticket to New York City.\"Mrs. Sanders agreed. 　　* * *Low-lying pewter-colored clouds rested on the mountaintops around Welch on the morning of Lori\u0027s departure. They were there most mornings, and when I noticed them, they reminded me of how isolated and forgotten the town was, a sad, lost place adrift in the clouds. The clouds usually burned away by midmorning, when the sun climbed above the steep hills, but some days, like the one Lori left, they clung to the mountains, and a fine mist formed in the valley that turned your hair and face damp. 　　When the Sanders family pulled up in their station wagon, Lori was ready. She had packed her clothes, her favorite books, and her art supplies in a single cardboard box. She hugged all of us except Dad梥he had refused to speak a word to him since he plundered Oz梡romised to write, and climbed into the station wagon. 　　We all stood watching as the car disappeared down Little Hobart Street. Lori never once looked back. I took that as a good sign. When I climbed the staircase to the house, Dad was standing on the porch, smoking a cigarette. 　　\"This family is falling apart,\" he said. 　　\"It sure is,\" I told him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/241/500.html","bookId":206,"book":{"id":206,"title":"玻璃城堡 The Glass Castle","description":"简介： The Glass Castle\u0027 is a 2005 memoir by Jeannette Walls.
