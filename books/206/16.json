{"id":6386,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"　　A MONTH LATER, I got a call from Mom. She was so excited she was tripping over her own words. She and Dad had found a place to live. Their new home, Mom said, was in an abandoned building on the Lower East Side. \"It\u0027s a tad run-down,\" she admitted. \"But all it really needs is a little TLC. And best of all, it\u0027s free.\"Other folks were also moving into abandoned buildings, she said. They were called squatters, and the buildings were called squats. \"Your father and I are pioneers,\" Mom said. \"Just like my great-great-grandfather, who helped tame the Wild West.\"Mom called in a few weeks and said that although the squat still needed a few finishing touches梐 front door, for example梥he and Dad were officially accepting visitors. I took the subway to Astor Place on a late spring day and headed east. Mom and Dad\u0027s apartment was in a six-story walk-up. The mortar was crumbling and bricks had come loose. All the windows on the first floor had been boarded up. I reached to open the building\u0027s front door, but where the lock and handle should have been, there was only a hole. Inside, a single naked lightbulb hung from a wire in the hallway. On one wall, chunks of plaster had crumbled away, revealing the wooden ribs and pipes and wiring. On the third floor, I knocked on the door to Mom and Dad\u0027s apartment and heard Dad\u0027s muffled voice. Instead of the door swinging inward, fingers appeared on both sides, and it was lifted out of the frame altogether. There was Dad, beaming and hugging me while he went on about how he\u0027d yet to install door hinges. As a matter of fact, they\u0027d only just gotten the door itself, which he\u0027d found in the basement of another abandoned building. 　　Mom came running up behind him, grinning so widely you could see her molars, and gave me a big hug. Dad knocked a cat off a chair梩hey had already taken in a few strays梐nd offered me a seat. The room was crammed with broken furniture, bundles of clothes, stacks of books, and Mom\u0027s art supplies. Four or five electric space heaters blasted away. Mom explained that Dad had hooked up every squat in the building to an insulated cable he\u0027d hot-wired off a utility pole down the block. \"We\u0027re all getting free juice, thanks to your father,\" Mom said. \"No one in the building could survive without him.\"Dad chuckled modestly. He told me how complicated the process had been, because the wiring in the building was so ancient. \"Damnedest electrical system I\u0027ve ever seen,\" he said. \"The manual must have been written in hieroglyphics.\"I looked around, and it hit me that if you replaced the electric heaters with a coal stove, this squat on the Lower East Side looked pretty much like the house on Little Hobart Street. I had escaped from Welch once, and now, breathing in those same old smells of turpentine, dog hair, and dirty clothes, of stale beer and cigarette smoke and unrefrigerated food slowly going bad, I had the urge to bolt. But Mom and Dad were clearly proud, and as I listened to them talk梚nterrupting each other in their excitement to correct points of fact and fill in gaps in the story梐bout their fellow squatters and the friends they\u0027d made in the neighborhood and the common fight against the city\u0027s housing agency, it became clear they\u0027d stumbled on an entire community of people like themselves, people who lived unruly lives battling authority and who liked it that way. After all those years of roaming, they\u0027d found home. 　　* * *I graduated from Barnard that spring. Brian came to the ceremony, but Lori and Maureen had to work, and Mom said it would just be a lot of boring speeches about the long and winding road of life. I wanted Dad to come, but chances were he\u0027d show up drunk and try to debate the commencement speaker. 　　\"I can\u0027t risk it, Dad,\" I told him. 　　\"Hell,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t have to see my Mountain Goat grabbing a sheepskin to know she\u0027s got her college degree.\"The magazine where I\u0027d been working two days a week had offered me a full-time job. What I needed was a place to live. For several years, I had been dating a man named Eric, a friend of one of Lori\u0027s eccentric-genius friends, who came from a wealthy family, ran a small company, and lived alone in the apartment on Park Avenue in which he\u0027d been raised. He was a detached, almost fanatically organized guy who maintained detailed time-management logs and could recite endless baseball statistics. But he was decent and responsible, never gambled or lost his temper, and always paid his bills on time. When he heard that I was looking for a roommate to share an apartment, he suggested I move in with him. I couldn\u0027t afford half the rent, I told him, and I wouldn\u0027t live there unless I could pay my own way. He suggested that I begin by paying what I could afford, and as my salary went up, I could increase the payment. He made it sound like a business proposition, but a solid one, and after thinking it over, I agreed. 　　When I told Dad about my plans, he asked if Eric made me happy and treated me well. \"Because if he doesn\u0027t,\" Dad said. \"I will by God kick his butt so hard, his asshole will be up between his shoulder blades.\"\"He treats me fine, Dad,\" I said. What I wanted to say was that I knew Eric would never try to steal my paycheck or throw me out the window, that I\u0027d always been terrified I\u0027d fall for a hard-drinking, hell-raising, charismatic scoundrel like you, Dad, but I\u0027d wound up with a man who was exactly the opposite. 　　* * *All my belongings fit into two plastic milk crates and a garbage bag. I hauled them to the street, hailed a taxi, and took it across town to Eric\u0027s building. The doorman, in a blue uniform with gold piping, hurried out from under the awning and insisted on carrying the milk crates into the lobby. 　　Eric\u0027s apartment had crossbeamed ceilings and a fireplace with an art deco mantel. I actually live on Park Avenue, I kept telling myself as I hung my clothes in the closet Eric had cleared out for me. Then I started thinking about Mom and Dad. When they had moved into their squat梐 fifteen-minute subway ride south and about half a dozen worlds away梚t seemed as if they had finally found the place where they belonged, and I wondered if I had done the same. 　　I INVITED MOM and Dad up to the apartment. Dad said he\u0027d feel out of place, and never did come, but Mom visited almost immediately. She turned over dishes to read the manufacturer\u0027s name and lifted the corner of the Persian rug to count the knots. She held the china to the light and ran her finger along the antique campaign chest. Then she went to the window and looked out at the brick and limestone apartment buildings across the street. \"I don\u0027t really like Park Avenue,\" she said. \"The architecture is too monotonous. I prefer the architecture on Central Park West.\"I told Mom she was the snootiest squatter I\u0027d ever met, and that made her laugh. We sat down on the living room couch. I had something I wanted to discuss with her. I now had a good job, I said, and was in a position to help her and Dad. I wanted to buy them something that would improve their lives. It could be a small car. It could be the security deposit and a few months\u0027 rent on an apartment. It could be the down payment on a house in an inexpensive neighborhood. 　　\"We don\u0027t need anything,\" Mom said. \"We\u0027re fine.\" She put down her teacup. \"It\u0027s you I\u0027m worried about.\"\"You\u0027re worried about me?\"\"Yes. Very worried.\"\"Mom,\" I said. \"I\u0027m doing very well. I\u0027m very, very comfortable.\"\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m worried about,\" Mom said. \"Look at the way you live. You\u0027ve sold out. Next thing I know, you\u0027ll become a Republican.\" She shook her head. \"Where are the values I raised you with?\"* * *Mom became even more concerned about my values when my editor offered me a job writing a weekly column about what he called the behind-the-scenes doings of the movers and shakers. Mom thought I should be writing expos閟 about oppressive landlords, social injustice, and the class struggle on the Lower East Side. But I leaped at the job, because it meant I would become one of those people who knew what was really going on. Also, most people in Welch had a pretty good idea how bad off the Walls family was, but the truth was, they all had their problems, too梩hey were just better than we were at covering them up. I wanted to let the world know that no one had a perfect life, that even the people who seemed to have it all had their secrets. 　　Dad thought it was great that I was writing a weekly column about, as he put it, the skinny dames and the fat cats. He became one of my most faithful readers, and would go to the library to research the people in the column, then call me with tips. \"This Astor broad has one helluva past,\" he told me one time. \"Maybe we should do a little digging in that direction.\" Eventually, even Mom acknowledged that I\u0027d done all right. \"No one expected you to amount to much,\" she told me. \"Lori was the smart one, Maureen the pretty one, and Brian the brave one. You never had much going for you except that you always worked hard.\"I loved my new job even more than I loved my Park Avenue address. I was invited to dozens of parties a week: art-gallery openings, benefit balls, movie premieres, book parties, and private dinners in marble-floored dining rooms. I met real estate developers, agents, heiresses, fund managers, lawyers, clothing designers, professional basketball players, photographers, movie producers, and television correspondents. I met people who owned entire collections of houses and spent more on one restaurant meal than my family had paid for 93 Little Hobart Street. 　　True or not, I was convinced that if all these people found out about Mom and Dad and who I really was, it would be impossible for me to keep my job. So I avoided discussing my parents. When that was impossible, I lied. 　　A year after I started the column, I was in a small, overstuffed restaurant across the table from an aging, elegant woman in a silk turban who oversaw the International Best Dressed List. 　　\"So, where are you from, Jeannette?\"\"West Virginia.\"\"Where?\"\"Welch.\"\"How lovely. What\u0027s the main industry in Welch?\"\"Coal mining.\"As she questioned me, she studied what I wore, assessing the fabric and appraising the cost of each item and making a judgment about my taste in general. 　　\"And does your family own coal mines?\"\"No.\"\"What do your parents do?\"\"Mom\u0027s an artist.\"\"And your father?\"\"He\u0027s an entrepreneur.\"\"Doing what?\"I took a breath. \"He\u0027s developing a technology to burn low-grade bituminous coal more efficiently.\"\"And they\u0027re still in West Virginia?\" she asked. 　　I decided I might as well go all out. \"They love it there,\" I said. \"They have a great old house on a hill overlooking a beautiful river. They spent years restoring it.\"MY LIFE WITH ERIC was calm and predictable. I liked it that way, and four years after I moved into his apartment, we got married. Shortly after the wedding, Mom\u0027s brother, my uncle Jim, died in Arizona. Mom came to the apartment to give me the news and to ask a favor. \"We need to buy Jim\u0027s land,\" she said. 　　Mom and her brother had each inherited half of the West Texas land that had been owned by their father. The whole time we kids were growing up, Mom had been mysteriously vague about how big and how valuable this land was, but I had the impression that it was a few hundred acres of more or less uninhabitable desert, miles from any road. 　　\"We need to keep that land in the family,\" Mom told me. \"It\u0027s important for sentimental reasons.\"\"Let\u0027s see if we can buy it, then,\" I said. \"How much will it cost?\"\"You can borrow the money from Eric now that he\u0027s your husband,\" Mom said. 　　\"I\u0027ve got a little money,\" I said. \"How much will it cost?\" I\u0027d read somewhere that off-road land in parched West Texas sold for as little as a hundred dollars an acre. 　　\"You can borrow from Eric,\" Mom said again. 　　\"Well, how much?\"\"A million dollars.\"\"What?\"\"A million dollars.\"\"But Uncle Jim\u0027s land is the same size as your land,\" I said. I was speaking slowly, because I wanted to make sure I understood the implications of what Mom had just told me. \"You each inherited half of Grandpa Smith\u0027s land.\"\"More or less,\" Mom said. 　　\"So if Uncle Jim\u0027s land is worth a million dollars, that means your land is worth a million dollars.\"\"I don\u0027t know.\"\"What do you mean, you don\u0027t know? It\u0027s the same size as his.\"\"I don\u0027t know how much it\u0027s worth, because I never had it appraised. I was never going to sell it. My father taught me you never sell land. That\u0027s why we have to buy Uncle Jim\u0027s land. We have to keep it in the family.\"\"You mean you own land worth a million dollars?\" I was thunderstruck. All those years in Welch with no food, no coal, no plumbing, and Mom had been sitting on land worth a million dollars? Had all those years, as well as Mom and Dad\u0027s time on the street梟ot to mention their current life in an abandoned tenement梑een a caprice inflicted on us by Mom? Could she have solved our financial problems by selling this land she never even saw? But she avoided my questions, and it became clear that to Mom, holding on to land was not so much an investment strategy as it was an article of faith, a revealed truth as deeply felt and incontestable to her as Catholicism. And for the life of me, I could not get her to tell me how much the land was worth. 　　\"I told you I don\u0027t know,\" she said. 　　\"Then tell me how many acres it is, and where exactly it is, and I\u0027ll find out how much an acre of land is going for in that area.\" I wasn\u0027t interested in her money; I just wanted to know梟eeded to know梩he answer to my question: How much was that freaking land worth? Maybe she truly didn\u0027t know. Maybe she was afraid to find out. Maybe she was afraid of what we\u0027d all think if we knew. But instead of answering me, she kept repeating that it was important to keep Uncle Jim\u0027s land條and that had belonged to her father and his father and his father before that梚n the family. 　　\"Mom, I can\u0027t ask Eric for a million dollars.\"\"Jeannette, I haven\u0027t asked you for a lot of favors, but I\u0027m asking you for one now. I wouldn\u0027t if it wasn\u0027t important. But this is important.\"I told Mom I didn\u0027t think Eric would lend me a million dollars to buy some land in Texas, and even if he would, I wouldn\u0027t borrow it from him. \"It\u0027s too much money,\" I said. \"What would I do with the land?\"\"Keep it in the family.\"\"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re asking me this,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve never even seen that land.\"\"Jeannette,\" Mom said when she had accepted the fact that she would not get her way. \"I\u0027m deeply disappointed in you.\"LORI WAS WORKING as a freelance artist specializing in fantasy, illustrating calendars and game boards and book jackets. Brian had joined the police force as soon as he turned twenty. Dad couldn\u0027t figure out what he\u0027d done wrong, raising a son who\u0027d grown up to become a member of the gestapo. But I was so proud of my brother on the day he was sworn in, standing there in the ranks of the new officers, straight-shouldered in his navy blue uniform with its glittering brass buttons. 　　Meanwhile, Maureen had graduated from high school and enrolled in one of the city colleges, but she never really applied herself and ended up living with Mom and Dad. She worked from time to time as a bartender or waitress, but the jobs never lasted long. Ever since she was a kid, she\u0027d been looking for someone to take care of her. In Welch, the Pentecostal neighbors provided for her, and now in New York, with her long blond hair and wide blue eyes, she found various men who were willing to help out. 　　The boyfriends never lasted any longer than the jobs. She talked about finishing college and going to law school, but distractions kept cropping up. The longer she stayed with Mom and Dad, the more lost she became, and after a while she was spending most of her days in the apartment, smoking cigarettes, reading novels, and occasionally painting nude self-portraits. That two-room squat was cramped, and Maureen and Dad would get into the worst screaming fights, with Maureen calling Dad a worthless drunk and Dad calling Maureen a sick puppy, the runt of the litter, who should have been drowned at birth. 　　Maureen even stopped reading and slept all day, leaving the apartment only to buy cigarettes. I called and persuaded her to come up to see me and discuss her future. When she arrived, I scarcely recognized her. She\u0027d bleached her hair and eyebrows platinum and was wearing dark makeup as thick as a Kabuki dancer\u0027s. She lit one cigarette after another and kept glancing around the room. When I brought up some career possibilities, she told me that the only thing she wanted to do was help fight the Mormon cults that had kidnapped thousands of people in Utah. 　　\"What cults?\" I asked. 　　\"Don\u0027t pretend you don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"That just means you\u0027re one of them.\"Afterward, I called Brian. \"Do you think Maureen\u0027s on drugs?\" I asked. 　　\"If she\u0027s not, she should be,\" he said. \"She\u0027s gone nuts.\"I told Mom that Maureen should get professional help, but Mom kept insisting that all Maureen needed was fresh air and sunshine. I talked to several doctors, but they told me that since it sounded like Maureen would refuse to seek help on her own, she could be treated only on the order of a court, if she proved she was a danger to herself or others. 　　* * *Six months later, Maureen stabbed Mom. It happened after Mom decided it was time for Maureen to develop a little self-sufficiency by moving out and finding a place of her own. God helps those who help themselves, Mom told Maureen, and so for her own good, she would have to leave the nest and make her way in the world. Maureen couldn\u0027t bear the idea that her own mom would kick her out onto the street, and she snapped. Mom insisted Maureen had not actually been trying to kill her梥he\u0027d just become confused and upset, she said梑ut the wounds required stitches, and the police arrested Maureen. 　　She was arraigned a few days later. Mom and Dad and Lori and Brian and I were all there. Brian was fuming. Lori looked grief-stricken. Dad was half potted and kept trying to pick fights with the security guards. But Mom acted like her normal self梟onchalant in the face of adversity. As we sat waiting on the courtroom benches, she hummed tunelessly and sketched the other spectators. 　　Maureen shuffled into the courtroom, shackled and wearing an orange jumpsuit. Her face was puffy, and she looked dazed, but when she saw us, she smiled and waved. Her lawyer asked the judge to set bail. I had borrowed several thousand dollars from Eric and had the cash in my purse. But after listening to the prosecutor\u0027s version of events, the judge shook her head grimly: \"Bail is denied.\"In the hallway, Lori and Dad got into a loud argument over who was responsible for pushing Maureen over the edge. Lori blamed Dad for creating a sick environment, while Dad maintained that Maureen had faulty wiring. Mom chimed in that all the junk food Maureen ate had led to a chemical imbalance, and Brian started yelling at them all to shut the hell up or he\u0027d arrest them. I just stood there looking from one distorted face to another, listening to this babble of enraged squabbling as the members of the Walls family gave vent to all their years of hurt and anger, each unloading his or her own accumulated grievances and blaming the others for allowing the most fragile one of us to break into pieces. 　　The judge sent Maureen to an upstate hospital. She was released after a year and immediately bought a one-way bus ticket to California. I told Brian that we had to stop her. She didn\u0027t know a single person in California. How would she survive? But Brian thought it was the smartest thing she could do for herself. He said she needed to get as far away from Mom and Dad, and probably the rest of us, as possible. 　　I decided Brian was right. But I also hoped that Maureen had chosen California because she thought that was her true home, the place where she really belonged, where it was always warm and you could dance in the rain, pick grapes right off the vines, and sleep outside at night under the stars. 　　Maureen did not want any of us to see her off. I rose just after first light the morning she was scheduled to leave. It was an early departure, and I wanted to be awake and thinking about her at the moment her bus pulled out, so I could say farewell in my mind. I went to the window and looked out at the cold, wet sky. I wondered if she was thinking of us and if she was going to miss us. I\u0027d always had mixed feelings about bringing her to New York, but I\u0027d agreed to let her come. Once she arrived, I\u0027d been too busy taking care of myself to look after her. \"I\u0027m sorry, Maureen,\" I said when the time came. \"sorry for everything.\"AFTER THAT, I HARDLY ever saw Mom or Dad. Neither did Brian. He had gotten married and bought a run-down Victorian house on Long Island that he restored, and he and his wife had a child, a little girl. They were his family now. Lori, who was still living in her apartment near the Port Authority, was more in touch with Mom and Dad, but she, too, had gone her own way. We hadn\u0027t gotten together since Maureen\u0027s arraignment. Something in all of us broke that day, and afterward, we no longer had the spirit for family gatherings. 　　About a year after Maureen took off for California, I got a call at work from Dad. He said he needed to get together to discuss something important. 　　\"Can\u0027t we do it over the phone?\"\"I need to see you in person, honey.\"Dad asked me to come down to the Lower East Side that evening. \"And if it\u0027s not too much trouble,\" he added. \"could you stop on your way and pick up a bottle of vodka?\"\"Oh, so that\u0027s what this is about.\"\"No, no, honey. I do need to talk to you. But I would appreciate some vodka. Nothing fancy, just the cheapest rotgut they have. A pint would be fine. A fifth would be great.\"I was annoyed by Dad\u0027s sly request for vodka梩ossing it out at the end of the conversation as if it were an afterthought, when I figured it was probably the purpose of the call. That afternoon I called Mom, who still never drank anything stronger than tea, and asked if I should indulge Dad. 　　\"Your father is who he is,\" Mom said. \"It\u0027s a little late in the game to try to reform him now. Humor the man.\"* * *That night I stopped in a liquor store and bought a half gallon of the cheapest rotgut on the shelf, just as Dad had requested, then took a taxi down to the Lower East Side. I climbed the dark staircase and pushed open the unlocked door. Mom and Dad were lying in their bed under a pile of thin blankets. I got the impression they\u0027d been there all day. Mom squealed when she saw me, and Dad started apologizing for the mess, saying if Mom would let him clear out some of her crap, they might at least be able to swing a cat in here, which got Mom accusing Dad of being a bum. 　　\"Good to see you,\" I said as I kissed them. \"It\u0027s been a while.\"Mom and Dad struggled up into sitting positions. I saw Dad eyeing the brown paper bag, and I passed it to him. 　　\"A magnum,\" Dad said, his voice choked with gratitude as he eased the big bottle from the bag. He unscrewed the cap and took a long, deep pull. \"Thank you, my darling,\" he said. \"You are so good to your old man.\"Mom wore a heavy cable-knit sweater. The skin of her hands was deeply cracked, and her hair was tangled, but her face had a healthy pink glow, and her eyes were clear and bright. Beside her, Dad looked gaunt. His hair, still coal black except for touches of gray at his temples, was combed back, but his cheeks were sunken, and he had a thin beard. He\u0027d always been clean-shaven, even during those days on the streets. 　　\"Why are you growing a beard, Dad?\" I asked. 　　\"Every man should grow one once.\"\"But why now?\"\"It\u0027s now or never,\" Dad said. \"The fact is, I\u0027m dying.\"I laughed nervously, then looked at Mom, who had reached for her sketch pad without saying anything. 　　Dad was watching me carefully. He passed me the vodka bottle. Although I almost never drank, I took a sip and felt the burn as the liquor slid down my throat. 　　\"This stuff could grow on you,\" I said. 　　\"Don\u0027t let it,\" Dad said. 　　He started telling me how he\u0027d acquired a rare tropical disease after getting into a bloody fistfight with some Nigerian drug dealers. The doctors had examined him, pronounced the rare disease incurable, and told him he had anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to live. 　　It was a ridiculous yarn. The fact was that, although Dad was only fifty-nine, he had been smoking four packs of cigarettes a day since he was thirteen, and by this time he was also putting away a good two quarts of booze daily. He was, as he had put it many a time, completely pickled. 　　But despite all the hell-raising and destruction and chaos he had created in our lives, I could not imagine what my life would be like梬hat the world would be like梬ithout him in it. As awful as he could be, I always knew he loved me in a way no one else ever had. I looked out the window. 　　\"Now, no snot-slinging or boohooing about \u0027poor ol\u0027Rex,\u0027\" Dad said. \"I don\u0027t want any of that, either now or when I\u0027m gone.\"I nodded. 　　\"But you always loved your old man, didn\u0027t you?\"\"I did, Dad,\" I said. \"And you loved me.\"\"Now, that\u0027s the God\u0027s honest truth.\" Dad chuckled. \"We had some times, didn\u0027t we?\"\"We did.\"\"Never did build that Glass Castle.\"\"No. But we had fun planning it.\"\"Those were some damn fine plans.\"Mom stayed out of the conversation, sketching quietly. 　　\"Dad,\" I said, \"I\u0027m sorry, I really should have asked you to my graduation.\"\"To hell with that.\" He laughed. \"Ceremonies never did mean diddly to me.\" He took another long pull on his magnum. \"I got a lot to regret about my life,\" he said. \"But I\u0027m goddamn proud of you, Mountain Goat, the way you turned out. Whenever I think of you, I figure I must have done something right.\"\"\u0027Course you did.\"\"Well, all right then.\"We talked about the old days some and, finally, it was time to go. I kissed them both, and at the door, I turned to look at Dad one more time. 　　\"Hey,\" he said. He winked and pointed his finger at me. \"Have I ever let you down?\"He started chuckling because he knew there was only one way I could ever answer that question. I just smiled. And then I closed the door.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/241/505.html","bookId":206,"book":{"id":206,"title":"玻璃城堡 The Glass Castle","description":"简介： The Glass Castle\u0027 is a 2005 memoir by Jeannette Walls.
