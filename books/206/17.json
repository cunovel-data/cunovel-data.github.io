Mom and Lori were standing next to him. \"It\u0027s just the machines keeping him alive at his point,\" Mom said.\\n\\n 　　I knew Dad would have hated that, spending his final moments in a hospital hooked up to machines. He\u0027d have wanted to be out in the wild somewhere. He always said that when he died, we should put him on a mountaintop and let the buzzards and coyotes tear his body apart. I had this crazy urge to scoop him up in my arms and charge through the doors梩o check out Rex Walls杝tyle one last time.\\n\\n 　　Instead, I took his hand. It was warm and heavy. An hour later, they turned the machines off.\\n\\n 　　* * *In the months that followed, I found myself always wanting to be somewhere other than where I was. If I was at work, I\u0027d wish I were at home. If I was in the apartment, I couldn\u0027t wait to get out of it. If a taxi I had hailed was stuck in traffic for over a minute, I got out and walked. I felt best when I was on the move, going someplace rather than being there. I took up ice-skating. I rose early in the morning and made my way through the quiet, dawn-lit streets to the rink, where I laced up my skates so tightly my feet throbbed. I welcomed the numbing cold and even the jolt of my falls on the hard, wet ice. The fast-paced, repetitive maneuvers distracted me, and sometimes I went back at night to skate again, returning home only when it was late and I was exhausted. It took me a while to realize that just being on the move wasn\u0027t enough; that I needed to reconsider everything.\\n\\n 　　* * *A year after Dad died, I left Eric. He was a good man, but not the right one for me. And Park Avenue was not where I belonged. I took a small apartment on the West Side. It had neither a doorman nor a fireplace, but there were large windows that flooded the rooms with light, and parquet floors and a small foyer, just like that first apartment Lori and I had found in the Bronx. It felt right.\\n\\n 　　I went ice-skating less often, and when my skates were stolen, I never replaced them. My compulsion to be always on the move began to fade. But I liked to go for long walks at night. I often walked west toward the river. The city lights obscured the stars, but on clear nights, I could see Venus on the horizon, up over the dark water, glowing steadily.\\n\\n 　　VTHANKSGIVINGI WAS STANDING ON the platform with my second husband, John. A whistle sounded in the distance, red lights flashed, and a bell clanged as the gates were lowered across the roadway. The whistle sounded again, and then the train appeared around the bend through the trees and rumbled toward the station, its massive twin headlights pale in the bright November afternoon.\\n\\n 　　The train eased to a stop. The electric engines hummed and vibrated, and after a long pause, the doors opened. Passengers spilled out, carrying their folded newspapers and canvas weekend bags and brightly colored coats. Through the crowd, I saw Mom and Lori getting out at the back of the train, and I waved.\\n\\n 　　It had been five years since Dad died. I had seen Mom only sporadically since then, and she\u0027d never met John nor been to the old country farmhouse we\u0027d bought the year before. It had been John\u0027s idea to invite her and Lori and Brian out to the house for Thanksgiving, the first Walls family get-together since Dad\u0027s funeral.\\n\\n 　　Mom broke into a huge smile and started hurrying toward us. Instead of an overcoat, she was wearing what looked to be about four sweaters and a shawl, a pair of corduroy trousers, and some old sneakers. She carried bulky shopping bags in both hands. Lori, behind her, wore a black cape and a black fedora. They made quite a pair.\\n\\n 　　Mom hugged me. Her long hair was mostly gray, but her cheeks were rosy and her eyes as bright as ever. Then Lori hugged me, and I introduced John.\\n\\n 　　\"Excuse my attire,\" Mom said. \"but I plan to change out of my comfy shoes into some dress shoes for dinner.\" She reached into one of her shopping bags and pulled out a pair of banged-up penny loafers.\\n\\n 　　* * *The winding road back to the house led under stone bridges, through woods and villages, and past marsh ponds where swans floated on mirrorlike water. Most of the leaves had fallen, and gusts of wind sent them spiraling along the roadside. Through the thickets of bare trees, you could see houses that were invisible during the summer.\\n\\n 　　As he drove, John told Mom and Lori about the area, about the duck farms and the flower farms and the Indian origin of our town\u0027s name. Sitting beside him, I studied his profile and couldn\u0027t help smiling. John wrote books and magazine articles. Like me, he had moved around a lot while growing up, but his mother had been raised in an Appalachian village in Tennessee, about a hundred miles southwest of Welch, so you could say our families hailed from the same neck of the woods. I\u0027d never met a man I would rather spend time with. I loved him for all sorts of reasons: He cooked without recipes; he wrote nonsense poems for his nieces; his large, warm family had accepted me as one of their own. And when I first showed him my scar, he said it was interesting. He used the word. \"textured.\" He said. \"smooth\" was boring but. \"textured\" was interesting, and the scar meant that I was stronger than whatever it was that had tried to hurt me.\\n\\n 　　* * *We pulled into the drive. Jessica, John\u0027s fifteen-year-old daughter from his first marriage, came out of the house, along with Brian and his eight-year-old daughter, Veronica, and their bull mastiff, Charlie. Brian hadn\u0027t seen much of Mom since Dad\u0027s funeral, either. He hugged her and immediately started ribbing her about the plucked-from-the-Dumpster presents she\u0027d brought for everyone in the shopping bags: rusting silverware, old books and magazines, a few pieces of fine bone china from the twenties with only minor chips.\\n\\n 　　Brian had become a decorated sergeant detective, supervising a special unit that investigated organized crime. He and his wife had split up around the time Eric and I did, but he had consoled himself by buying and renovating a wreck of a town house in Brooklyn. He put in new wiring and plumbing, a new firebox, reinforced floor joists, and a new porch all on his own. It was the second time he\u0027d taken on a true dump and restored it to perfection. Also, at least two women were after him to marry them. He was doing pretty darn well.\\n\\n 　　We showed Mom and Lori the gardens, which were ready for winter. John and I had done all the work ourselves: raked the leaves and shredded them in the chipper, cut back the dead perennials and mulched the beds, shoveled compost onto the vegetable garden and tilled it, and dug up the dahlia bulbs and stored them in a bucket of sand in the basement. John had also split and stacked the wood from a dead maple we\u0027d cut down, and climbed up on the roof to replace some rotted cedar shingles.\\n\\n 　　Mom nodded at all our preparations; she\u0027d always appreciated self-sufficiency. She admired the wisteria that wrapped around the potting shed, the trumpet vine on the arbor, and the big grove of bamboo in the back. When she saw the pool, an impulse seized her, and she ran out onto the green elastic cover to test its strength, Charlie the dog loping after her. The cover sagged beneath them, and she fell down, shrieking with laughter. John and Brian had to help pull her off as Brian\u0027s daughter, Veronica梬ho hadn\u0027t seen Mom since she was a toddler梥tared wide-eyed.\\n\\n 　　\"Grandma Walls is different from your other grandma,\" I told her.\\n\\n 　　\"Way different,\" Veronica said.\\n\\n 　　John\u0027s daughter, Jessica, turned to me and said, \"But she laughs just like you do.\"* * *I showed Mom and Lori the house. I still went into the office in the city once a week, but this was where John and I lived and worked, our home梩he first house I\u0027d ever owned. Mom and Lori admired the wide-planked floorboards, the big fireplaces, and the ceiling beams made from locust posts, with gouge marks from the ax that had felled them. Mom\u0027s eye settled on an Egyptian couch we\u0027d bought at a flea market. It had carved legs and a wooden backrest inlaid with mother-of-pearl triangles. She nodded in approval. \"Every household,\" she said. \"needs one piece of furniture in really bad taste.\"The kitchen was filled with the smell of the roasting turkey John had prepared, with a stuffing of sausage, mushrooms, walnuts, apples, and spiced bread crumbs. He\u0027d also made creamed onions, wild rice, cranberry sauce, and squash casserole. I\u0027d baked three pies with apples from a nearby orchard.\\n\\n 　　\"Bonanza!\" Brian shouted.\\n\\n 　　\"Feast time!\" I said to him.\\n\\n 　　He looked at the dishes. I knew what he was thinking, what he thought every time he saw a spread like this one. He shook his head and said. \"You know, it\u0027s really not that hard to put food on the table if that\u0027s what you decide to do.\"\"Now, no recriminations,\" Lori told him.\\n\\n 　　After we sat down for dinner, Mom told us her good news. She had been a squatter for almost fifteen years, and the city had finally decided to sell the apartments to her and the other squatters for one dollar apiece. She couldn\u0027t accept our invitation to stay awhile, she said, because she had to get back for a board meeting of the squatters. Mom also said she\u0027d been in touch with Maureen, who was still living in California, and that our kid sister, whom I hadn\u0027t spoken to since she left New York, was thinking of coming back for a visit.\\n\\n 　　We started talking about some of Dad\u0027s great escapades: letting me pet the cheetah, taking us Demon Hunting, giving us stars for Christmas.\\n\\n 　　\"We should drink a toast to Rex,\" John said.\\n\\n 　　Mom stared at the ceiling, miming perplexed thought. \"I\u0027ve got it.\" She held up her glass. \"Life with your father was never boring.\"We raised our glasses. I could almost hear Dad chuckling at Mom\u0027s comment in the way he always did when he was truly enjoying something. It had grown dark outside. A wind picked up, rattling the windows, and the candle flames suddenly shifted, dancing along the border between turbulence and order.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/241/506.html","bookId":206,"book":{"id":206,"title":"玻璃城堡 The Glass Castle","description":"简介： The Glass Castle\u0027 is a 2005 memoir by Jeannette Walls.
