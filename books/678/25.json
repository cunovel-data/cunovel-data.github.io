{"id":18032,"no":25,"title":"The Noser and the Note","content":"The Head Rifler of an insolvent bank, learning that it was about to be visited by the official Noser into Things, placed his own personal note for a large amount among its resources, and, gaily touching his guitar, awaited the inspection. When the Noser came to the note he asked, “What’s this?”\\n\\n “That,” said the Assistant Pocketer of Deposits, “is one of our liabilities.”\\n\\n “A liability?” exclaimed the Noser. “Nay, nay, an asset. That is what you mean, doubtless.”\\n\\n “Therein you err,” the Pocketer explained; “that note was written in the bank with our own pen, ink, and paper, and we have not paid a stationery bill for six months.”\\n\\n “Ah, I see,” the Noser said, thoughtfully; “it is a liability. May I ask how you expect to meet it?”\\n\\n “With fortitude, please God,” answered the Assistant Pocketer, his eyes to Heaven raising —“with fortitude and a firm reliance on the laxity of the law.”\\n\\n “Enough, enough,” exclaimed the faithful servant of the State, choking with emotion; “here is a certificate of solvency.”\\n\\n “And here is a bottle of ink,” the grateful financier said, slipping it into the other’s pocket; “it is all that we have.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/799.html","bookId":678,"book":{"id":678,"title":"绮丽的寓言","description":"简介： 这本独特的书是由245个绮丽的寓言组成，每一个都是Bierce通过犀利的洞察力对贪婪的政客，不那么神圣的圣人，立法会议员，医生，法官和外交官等人观察与评判的经典之作。许多人喜...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
