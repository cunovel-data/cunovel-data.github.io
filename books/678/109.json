I am very comfortable without office.”\n “But,” urged the Party Manager, “an election is a thing to be desired. It is a high honour to be a servant of the people.”\n “If servitude is a high honour,” the Gentleman said, “it would be indecent for me to seek it; and if obtained by my own exertion it would be no honour.”\n “Well,” persisted the Party Manager, “you will at least, I hope, indorse the party platform.”\n The Gentleman replied: “It is improbable that its authors have accurately expressed my views without consulting me; and if I indorsed their work without approving it I should be a liar.”\n “You are a detestable hypocrite and an idiot!” shouted the Party Manager.\n “Even your good opinion of my fitness,” replied the Gentleman, “shall not persuade me.”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/921.html","bookId":678,"book":{"id":678,"title":"绮丽的寓言","description":"简介： 这本独特的书是由245个绮丽的寓言组成，每一个都是Bierce通过犀利的洞察力对贪婪的政客，不那么神圣的圣人，立法会议员，医生，法官和外交官等人观察与评判的经典之作。许多人喜...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
