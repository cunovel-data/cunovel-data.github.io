{"id":18045,"no":38,"title":"The Ashes of Madame Blavatsky","content":"The two brightest lights of Theosophy being in the same place at once in company with the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky, an Inquiring Soul thought the time propitious to learn something worth while. So he sat at the feet of one awhile, and then he sat awhile at the feet of the other, and at last he applied his ear to the keyhole of the casket containing the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky. When the Inquiring Soul had completed his course of instruction he declared himself the Ahkoond of Swat, fell into the baleful habit of standing on his head, and swore that the mother who bore him was a pragmatic paralogism. Wherefore he was held in high reverence, and when the two other gentlemen were hanged for lying the Theosophists elected him to the leadership of their Disastral Body, and after a quiet life and an honourable death by the kick of a jackass he was reincarnated as a Yellow Dog. As such he ate the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky, and Theosophy was no more.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/812.html","bookId":678,"book":{"id":678,"title":"绮丽的寓言","description":"简介： 这本独特的书是由245个绮丽的寓言组成，每一个都是Bierce通过犀利的洞察力对贪婪的政客，不那么神圣的圣人，立法会议员，医生，法官和外交官等人观察与评判的经典之作。许多人喜...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
