Seeing his reflection, he supposed it to be another dog, outside, and said:\\n\\n “I can chew up any such milksoppy pup as that, and I will.”\\n\\n So he ran out-of-doors and around to the side of the house where he fancied the enemy was. It so happened that at that moment a Bulldog sat there sunning his teeth. The Spaniel stopped short in dire consternation, and, after regarding the Bulldog a moment from a safe distance, said:\\n\\n “I don’t know whether you cultivate the arts of peace or your flag is flung to the battle and the breeze and your voice is for war. If you are a civilian, the windows of this house flatter you worse than a newspaper, but if you’re a soldier, they do you a grave injustice.”\\n\\n This speech being unintelligible to the Bulldog he only civilly smiled, which so terrified the Spaniel that he dropped dead in his tracks.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/947.html","bookId":678,"book":{"id":678,"title":"绮丽的寓言","description":"简介： 这本独特的书是由245个绮丽的寓言组成，每一个都是Bierce通过犀利的洞察力对贪婪的政客，不那么神圣的圣人，立法会议员，医生，法官和外交官等人观察与评判的经典之作。许多人喜...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
