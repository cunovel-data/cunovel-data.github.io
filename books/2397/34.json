Nisha could wait a few minutes. “Come on,” Thayer said, leading her into a narrow hallway that connected the math wing and the arts wing. There weren’t any classrooms in the corridor—just a janitor’s closet, a pair of bathrooms, and the photography darkrooms. They were alone except for a pimpled marching band couple making out against the wall under an army recruitment poster. “I need to talk to you,” he said, stopping next to a fire alarm. His lips were pulled into a serious line. The bruise on his eye looked almost green under the fluorescent lights. Emma laughed nervously. “Okay. What’s up?” Her phone vibrated again and she glanced at it. Nisha. Take a hint, she thought, hitting IGNORE again. He grabbed her arm. Her gaze shot up to meet his, his touch seeming to scald her. “There’s something different about you,” he whispered angrily. Emma’s heart skipped in her chest. She pulled away from him and crossed her arms over her chest. “Of course there’s something different, Thayer. Look, we’re not together anymore. You shouldn’t have kissed me. I’m not the girl you used to date, not anymore.” Her phone rang again, and Thayer gritted his teeth. “Do you need to get that, or what?” “No,” she said shortly, hitting IGNORE. She looked back up at him. He was searching her features, like he was trying to solve a puzzle and couldn’t figure out which way to turn the piece. He shook his head. “Something’s going on with you. It’s not just Landry. There’s something … off. I don’t care what you say, Sutton. I’m going to find out what it is.” Emma tossed her hair flippantly, even though her entire body had gone cold. “Are you off the wagon? Because you’re acting totally high.” Thayer gave her a long, piercing look. She had to get away from him, had to hide from his gaze before he saw something in her that he shouldn’t. She pushed his shoulder playfully. “Now I’m going to class, Mr. Conspiracy Theory. Hurry up or you’ll be late to English. Mr. Abernathy isn’t going to let you off the hook a third time.” With that she spun on her heel and walked away, feeling his eyes boring into her back as she strutted down the hallway. I’m right here, I whispered to Thayer, before my attachment to Emma tugged me forcefully along after her. Even though I didn’t want Emma’s cover blown, my heart swelled. At least Thayer had finally noticed that Emma wasn’t a perfect Sutton replacement. Had finally sensed that I was gone. Emma looked at her phone again. CALL ME ASAP, I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, Nisha had texted her. But before she could dial, the bell rang. Kids disappeared into the classrooms up and down the hall. She turned off the ringer and put the phone back into her purse. Nisha would have to wait until tennis practice. 35 CALL ME MAYBE Later that night, the Mercers sat at the patio table in their backyard, waiting for Ethan to arrive. Despite Emma’s insistence that he really didn’t have to come, Ethan had been determined to make the effort, saying he felt much better. Citronella candles flickered around them to keep the bugs off. Mr. Mercer had put a jazz record on the outdoor sound system, and even though Emma muttered that it was “so lame,” she secretly liked the effort they’d put in for her boyfriend. Ethan had texted her to tell her he was running late: SORRY, MOM STUFF, BE THERE SOON. Ever since Ethan had told her that Mrs. Landry had defended her abusive husband and called the cops on her own son, Emma had found it difficult to feel charitable toward Ethan’s mother. Of course it was terrible that she was sick. But Ethan was trying so hard to take care of her, and she treated him like dirt. Emma picked at the chips and salsa, fiddling with her phone. Nisha hadn’t been at tennis, and she was a little worried. She’d called and texted her friend a dozen times since school got out, but there was no answer. Laurel eyed her over the table while Mr. and Mrs. Mercer wrestled with a stubbornly corked wine bottle. “Everything okay?” she asked softly. “Um, yeah,” said Emma. She couldn’t very well tell Laurel that she felt perched on the verge of exposure. Thayer suspected she wasn’t who she claimed to be. She kept thinking about the look on his face when he’d said he would find out what she was hiding. He’d meant it. The question now was, what would he do next? The doorbell rang, and Emma jumped up to answer the front door. Ethan stood on the step, holding a bouquet of lilies and roses. He wore a sports jacket that she’d bought with him at Nordstrom a few weeks earlier, and his usually disheveled hair had been neatly styled. She leaned up and kissed him softly on the cheek. “You look great,” she said. He looked her up and down. “So do you,” he said. She’d changed into a short coral-colored shirt dress, casual enough for a patio dinner but still splashy enough to get his attention. He picked up a lock of her hair and smoothed it back. “How are you feeling?” she asked. “Much better, now that I’ve seen you.” He kissed her lightly on the cheek. “I’m so sorry to be late for your parents. I had to get a refill on one of my mom’s medicines at the last minute. I just wish she’d told me earlier.” For a moment she thought about telling him what Thayer had said to her, asking what he thought they should do. But she didn’t think bringing up Thayer right now was a great idea. She didn’t want a fight right before dinner with her family. They could discuss it later, when they were alone. “Hi, Ethan,” Mrs. Mercer said brightly as Emma led him out to the patio. She wore a lemon-yellow apron over her silk button-down shirt. She’d been to the salon just that afternoon, and her dark hair hung in perfect waves around her shoulders. “You’re just in time. The enchiladas are ready.” “They smell terrific,” he said, handing Emma’s grandmother the bouquet. “You shouldn’t have!” Mrs. Mercer exclaimed, breathing in the smell of the flowers. “I’ll run in and get a vase.” “Suck-up,” Emma muttered at Ethan. He grinned. Mr. Mercer took a sip of his wine, watching Ethan warily over the top of his glass. “Well, Ethan,” he said, clearing his throat. “How’s school going?” Emma stifled a giggle—whenever Mr. Mercer talked to Ethan he unconsciously adopted a stern, paternal air, a don’t-you-dare-hurt-my-little-girl tone of voice. Ethan fidgeted nervously under his stare. “It’s going great.” He smiled shyly at Emma. “I was going to tell Sutton in private, but now’s as good a time as any. I actually got my early admission letter from UC Davis today. A full ride and everything.” Emma squealed loudly, her hands flying to her lips. “Ethan! That’s awesome!” “Well, congratulations, son,” Mr. Mercer said, setting his glass down. “Did Sutton tell you that’s my alma mater?” Emma looked at her grandfather, surprised. She hadn’t known that. He was smiling warmly at Ethan now, his lecturing tone melted away. “No, she didn’t,” Ethan said, glancing at Emma. “It’s a great school,” he continued. “You’ll fit right in there, Ethan. And you won’t find a better education anywhere.” He lifted his glass again. “This calls for a toast, I think.” Emma picked up her iced tea, raising it high. She was so proud of Ethan. “To the future,” said Mr. Mercer. “To past and future Aggies.” “Hear! Hear!” cried Emma, laughing. They all clinked their glasses together over the table. Emma rested her foot against Ethan’s under the table. “So I guess the science fair stunt didn’t hurt you too much after all,” Laurel said, winking at Ethan. Emma flinched. She didn’t know the whole story, but she knew that Sutton and the Lying Game girls had ruined Ethan’s chances for a scholarship a few years earlier through some kind of prank. Ethan just laughed. “No, but I’ll hang on to it, anyway. I need something to hold over her head.” He squeezed Emma’s hand, and they shared a private smile. Soon their plates were heaped with blue corn enchiladas, Spanish rice, and avocado salad. Emma sipped at her tea, listening to Mr. Mercer reminisce about his years in college. Ethan listened eagerly, asking questions about the town and the school. Their laughter rang out in the cool fall evening, the stars bright overhead. Right now, in this moment, everything was perfect. Then Mr. Mercer’s ringtone, the shrill old-fashioned jangle of a rotary phone, broke through their conversation. He pulled it out and looked down at the screen. Mrs. Mercer cleared her throat. “We’re eating, dear.” “I know, I’m sorry. I have to take this—I’ll be right back.” He rose and stepped into the house. “Sanjay, calm down,” Emma heard him say before he slid the door shut behind him. She stopped eating and looked toward her father, watching him through the sliding glass door. Sanjay? That was Dr. Banerjee’s first name. Had something happened to Becky? Emma strained her ears to try to catch what Mr. Mercer was saying on the phone, but she couldn’t hear anything. His face had gone very white. She made out the words “You found her where? Are you sure?” Emma’s stomach clenched and she pushed the rest of her enchiladas away across the table. It had to be Becky. After all that, Becky hadn’t even made it out of town. Ethan’s eyes flashed questioningly at her. The door slid back open. Mr. Mercer stood helplessly in the doorway. His face was twisted with grief. When Mrs. Mercer looked up and saw him there, she rose to her feet automatically. “Ted … what is it?” Mr. Mercer licked his lips. In the porch light his face was heavily shadowed. “That was Sanjay Banerjee,” he said in a low, broken voice. “He just found Nisha facedown in their swimming pool. She’s dead.” EPILOGUE My family stares at one another over the round table filled with steaming dishes and wine glasses smudged with lipstick and fresh flowers springing out of their vase. Laurel’s hands have flown to her mouth and frozen there, while Mrs. Mercer sits in mute shock. Ethan’s eyes are wide with horror. And Emma—who is no stranger to violence by now—clenches her phone in one hand. The screen shows all the phone calls from Nisha she’d ignored. They’d stopped abruptly that afternoon, right after school. Could she have saved Nisha’s life if she’d just picked up the phone? As I watch my family grieve, I wonder where Nisha’s soul has gone. If she has attached herself to someone else, hoping to wrap up her unfinished business. Will I be able to see her if she’s there, or will she be as invisible as I am to the people at this table right now? I look around, half hoping to see my old nemesis. It would be a relief to have someone to talk to, even if I’m not sure what I’d say. So, death sucks, right? I’m glad you and my sister became friends. But there’s no sign of Nisha in the yard. Emma sobs suddenly, a sound like an awkward hiccup, and Ethan pulls her into his arms.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-hope-to-die-the-lying-game-5/page-34.html","bookId":2397,"book":{"id":2397,"title":"Cross My Heart, Hope To Die (The Lying Game #5)","description":"Storyline: Cross My Heart, Hope To Die (The Lying Game #5) Cross My Heart, Hope to Die is the fifth title in the suspenseful and twisted Lying Game series by Sara Shepard, author of the #1 New York Times bestselling series Pretty Little Liars.
