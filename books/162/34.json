{"id":4656,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 34","content":"Maurice took a week\u0027s holiday in August and reached Penge according to invitation three days before the Park v. Village cricket match. He arrived in an odd and bitter mood. He had been thinking over Risley\u0027s hypnotist, and grew much inclined to consult him. It was such a nuisance. For in-stance, as he drove up through the park he saw a gamekeeper dallying with two of the maids, and felt a pang of envy. The girls were damned ugly, which the man wasn\u0027t: somehow this made it worse, and he stared at the trio, feeling cruel and re-spectable; the girls broke away giggling, the man returned the stare furtively and then thought it safer to touch his cap; he had spoilt that little game. But they would meet again when he had passed, and all over the world girls would meet men, to kiss them and be kissed; might it not be better to alter his tempera-ment and toe the line? He would decide after his visit—for against hope he was still hoping for something from Clive.\\n\\n \"Clive\u0027s out,\" said the young hostess. \"He sends you his love or something, and will be in to dinner. Archie London will look after you, but I don\u0027t believe you want looking after.\"\\n\\n Maurice smiled and accepted some tea. The drawing-room had its old air. Groups of people stood about with the air of ar-ranging something, and though Clive\u0027s mother no longer pre-sided she remained in residence, owing to the dower house drains. The sense of dilapidation had increased. Through pour-ing rain he had noticed gate posts crooked, trees stifling, and\\n\\n indoors some bright wedding presents showed as patches on a threadbare garment. Miss Woods had brought no money to Penge. She was accomplished and delightful, but she belonged to the same class as the Durhams, and every year England grew less inclined to pay her highly.\\n\\n \"Clive\u0027s canvassing,\" she continued, \"there\u0027ll be a by-election in the autumn. He has at last induced them to induce him to stand\"; she had the aristocratic knack of anticipating criticism. \"But seriously, it will be a wonderful thing for the poor if he gets in. He is their truest friend, if only they knew it.\"\\n\\n Maurice nodded. He felt disposed to discuss social problems. \"They want drilling a bit,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Yes, they need a leader,\" said a gentle but distinguished voice, \"and until they find one they will suffer.\" Anne introduced the new rector, Mr Borenius. He was her own importation. Clive did not mind whom he appointed if the man was a gentleman and devoted himself to the village. Mr Borenius fulfilled both conditions, and as he was High Church might strike a balance against the outgoing incumbent, who had been Low.\\n\\n \"Oh Mr Borenius, how interesting!\" the old lady cried from across the room. \"But I suppose in your opinion we all want a leader. I quite agree.\" She darted her eyes hither and thither. \"AH of you want a leader, I repeat.\" And Mr Borenius\u0027s eyes followed hers, perhaps looking for something he did not find, for he soon took leave.\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t have anything to do at the Rectory,\" said Anne thoughtfully, \u0027Taut he always is like that. He comes up to scold Clive about the housing, and won\u0027t stop to dinner. You see, he\u0027s so sensitive; he worries about the poor.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had to do with the poor too,\" said Maurice, taking a piece of cake, \"but I can\u0027t worry over them. One must give them a leg up for the sake of the country generally, that\u0027s all. They\\n\\n haven\u0027t our feelings. They don\u0027t suffer as we should in their place.\"\\n\\n Anne looked disapproval, but she felt she had entrusted her hundred pounds to the right sort of stock broker.\\n\\n \"Caddies and a college mission in the slums is all I know. Still, I\u0027ve learned a little. The poor don\u0027t want pity. They only really like me when I\u0027ve got the gloves on and am knocking them about.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you teach them boxing.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and play football. . . they\u0027re rotten sportsmen.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose they are. Mr Borenius says they want love,\" said Anne after a pause.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no doubt they do, but they won\u0027t get it.\"\\n\\n \"Mr Hall!\"\\n\\n Maurice wiped his moustache and smiled.\\n\\n \"You\u0027rehorrible.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think. I suppose that does sound so.\"\\n\\n \"But do you like being horrible?\"\\n\\n \"One gets used to anything,\" he said, suddenly turning, for the door had blown open behind.\\n\\n \"Well, good gracious me, I scold Clive for being cynical, but you outdo him.\"\\n\\n \"I get used to being horrible, as you call it, as the poor do to their slums. It\u0027s only a question of time.\" He was speaking rather freely; a biting recklessness had come to him since his arrival. Clive hadn\u0027t bothered to be in to receive him. Very well! \"After you\u0027ve banged about a bit you get used to your particular hole. Everyone yapping at the start like a lot of puppies, Waou! Waou!\" His unexpected imitation made her laugh. \"At last you learn that everyone\u0027s far too busy to listen to you, so you stop yapping. That\u0027s a fact.\"\\n\\n \"A man\u0027s view,\" she said, nodding her head. \"I\u0027ll never let Clive hold it. I believe in sympathy... in bearing one another\u0027s\\n\\n burdens. No doubt I\u0027m unfashionable. Are you a disciple of Nietzsche?\"\\n\\n \"Ask me another!\"\\n\\n Anne liked this Mr Hall, whom Clive had warned her she might find unresponsive. So he was in a way, but evidently he had personality. She understood why her husband had found him a good travelling companion in Italy. \"Now why don\u0027t you like the poor?\" she asked suddenly.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t dislike them. I just don\u0027t think about them except when I\u0027m obliged. These slums, syndicalism, all the rest of it, are a public menace, and one has to do one\u0027s little bit against them. But not for love. Your Mr Borenius won\u0027t face facts.\"\\n\\n She was silent, then asked him how old he was.\\n\\n \"Twenty-four tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re very hard for your age.\"\\n\\n \"Just now you said I was horrible. You\u0027re letting me off very easily, Mrs Durham!\"\\n\\n \"Anyhow, you\u0027re set, which is worse.\"\\n\\n She saw him frown, and, fearing she had been impertinent, turned the talk on to Clive. She had expected Clive to be back by now, she said, and it was the more disappointing because to-morrow Clive would have to be really away. The agent, who knew the constituency, was showing him round. Mr Hall must be forgiving, and he must help them in the cricket match.\\n\\n \"It rather depends upon some other plans. ... I might have to...\\n\\n She glanced at his face with a sudden curiosity, then said, \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to see your room?—Archie, take Mr Hall to the Russet Room.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.... Is there a post out?\"\\n\\n \"Not this evening, but you can wire. Wire you\u0027ll stop. ... Or oughtn\u0027t I to interfere?\"\\n\\n \"I may have to wire—I\u0027m not quite sure. Thanks frightfully.\"\\n\\n Then he followed Mr London to the Russet Room, thinking \"Clive might have ... for the sake of the past he might have been here to greet me. He ought to have known how wretched I should feel.\" He didn\u0027t care for Clive, but he could suffer from him. The rain poured out of a leaden sky on to the park, the woods were silent. As twilight fell, he entered a new circle of torment.\\n\\n He stopped up in the room till dinner, fighting with ghosts he had loved. If this new doctor could alter his being, was it not his duty to go, though body and soul would be violated? With the world as it is, one must marry or decay. He was not yet free of Clive and never would be until something greater intervened.\\n\\n \"Is Mr Durham back?\" he inquired, when the housemaid brought hot water.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Just in?\"\\n\\n \"No. About half an hour, sir.\"\\n\\n She drew the curtains and hid the sight but not the sound of the rain. Meanwhile Maurice scribbled a wire. \" \u0027Lasker Jones, 6 Wigmore Place, W.,\u0027 \" he read. \" \u0027Please make appointment Thursday. Hall. C/o Durham, Penge, Wiltshire.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks so much,\" he said deferentially, and grimaced as soon as he was alone. There was now a complete break between his public and private actions. In the drawing-room he greeted Clive without a tremor. They shook hands warmly, Clive saying, \"You look awfully fit. Do you know whom you are going to take in?\" and introducing him to a girl. Clive had become quite the squire. All his grievances against society had passed since his marriage. Agreeing politically, they had plenty to talk about.\\n\\n On his side, Clive was pleased with his visitor. Anne had re-ported him as \"rough, but very nice\"—a satisfactory condition. There was a coarseness of fibre about him, but that didn\u0027t matter\\n\\n now: that horrible scene about Ada could be forgotten. Maurice also got on well with Archie London—important, for Archie bored Anne and was the sort of man who could fix on to some-one. Clive assigned them to each other, for the visit.\\n\\n In the drawing-room they talked politics again, convinced every one of them that radicals are untruthful, and socialists mad. The rain poured down with a monotony nothing could dis-turb. In the lulls of conversation its whisper entered the room, and towards the end of the evening there was \"tap, tap\" on the lid of the piano.\\n\\n \"The family ghost again,\" said Mrs Durham with a bright smile.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s the sweetest hole in the ceiling,\" cried Anne. \"Clive, can\u0027t we leave it?\"\\n\\n \"We shall have to,\" he remarked, ringing the bell. \"Let\u0027s shift our pianoforte though. It won\u0027t stand much more.\"\\n\\n \"How about a saucer?\" said Mr London. \"Clive, how about a saucer? Once the rain came through the ceiling of the club, I rang the bell and the servant brought a saucer.\"\\n\\n \"I ring the bell and the servant brings nothing,\" said Clive, pealing again. \"Yes, we\u0027ll have a saucer, Archie, but we must move the piano too. Anne\u0027s dear little hole may grow in the night. There\u0027s only a lean-to roof over this part of the room.\"\\n\\n \"Poor Penge!\" said his mother. All had risen to their feet, and were gazing at the leak. Anne began to probe the piano\u0027s entrails with blotting paper. The evening had broken up, and they were well content to make fun about the rain, which had sent them this hint of its presence.\\n\\n \"Bring a basin, will you,\" said Clive, when the bell was an-swered, \"and a duster, and get one of the men to help shift the piano and take up the carpet in the bay. The rain\u0027s come through again.\"\\n\\n \"We had to ring twice, ring twice,\" remarked his mother.\\n\\n \"Le delai s\u0027explique,\" she added, for when the parlourmaid returned it was with the keeper as well as the valet. \"C\u0027est tou-jours comme 5a quand—we have our little idylls below stairs too, you know.\"\\n\\n \"You men, what do you want to do tomorrow?\" said Clive to his guests. \"I must go canvassing. Don\u0027t come too. It\u0027s beyond words dull. Like to take out a gun or what?\"\\n\\n \"Very nice,\" said Maurice and Archie.\\n\\n \"Scudder, do you hear?\"\\n\\n \"Le bpnhomme est distrait,\" said his mother. The piano had rucked up a rug, and the servants, not liking to raise their voices before gentlefolk, misunderstood one another\u0027s orders, and whis-pered \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Scudder, the gentlemen\u0027ll shoot tomorrow—I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what, but come round at ten. Shall we turn in now?\"\\n\\n \"Early to bed\u0027s the rule here, as you know, Mr Hall,\" said Anne. Then she wished the three servants good night and led the way upstairs. Maurice lingered to choose a book. Might Lecky\u0027sHistory of Rationalism fill a gap? The rain dripped into the basin, the men muttered over the carpet in the bay, and, kneel-ing, seemed to celebrate some obsequy.\\n\\n \"Damnation, isn\u0027t there anything, anything?\"\\n\\n \"—ish, he\u0027s not talking to us,\" said the valet to the gamekeeper.\\n\\n Lecky it was, but his mind proved unequal, and after a few minutes he threw it on the bed and brooded over the telegram. In the dreariness of Penge his purpose grew stronger. Life had proved a blind alley, with a muck heap at the end of it, and he must cut back and start again. One could be absolutely trans-formed, Risley implied, provided one didn\u0027t care a damn for the past. Farewell, beauty and warmth. They ended in muck and must go. Drawing the curtains, he gazed long into the rain, and sighed, and struck his own face, and bit his own lips.\\n\\n 八月份，莫瑞斯请了一周的假，按照邀请，在彭杰和村民之间举行板球赛的三天前来到这座庄园。他是怀着古怪、怨愤的心情抵达的。他一直在想着里斯利谈及的那位催眠术师的事，强烈地倾向于找他诊治。这种病太讨厌了。比方说，当他乘马车在园林中穿行的时候，他瞧见一个猎场看守正在跟两个女仆调情，一阵妒意袭上心头。两个姑娘丑陋得很，那个男人却不以为然。不知怎的，这就更糟了。他瞪着那三个人，觉得自己既残酷又一本正经。两个姑娘咯咯地笑着脱逃了。男人鬼鬼祟祟地偷看了他一眼，觉得伸手碰碰便帽更安全一些。他给三个人的小小游戏泼了冷水。然而，他一旦离开这里，他们仍会凑到一起，相互接吻。他是否应该改变自己的气质，随大溜儿呢？他要等造访之后再决定——心存万一的希望，对克莱夫有所期待。\\n\\n “克莱夫出门了。”年轻的女主人说，“他向你致意，回来吃晚饭。阿尔赤（译注：阿尔赤是阿尔赤鲍尔德的昵称）。伦敦会照料你。可我不相信你需要照料。”\\n\\n 莫瑞斯微微一笑，喝下给他端来的茶。客厅还留有昔日的气氛。人们三三两两地伫立在周围，仿佛在安排什么事的样子。克莱夫的母亲尽管不再当家做主，却仍住在主楼里，因为寡妇房的下水道堵塞了。整座宅第更加给人以荒废之感。隔着瓢泼大雨，他注意到大门柱弯曲了，树木郁郁苍苍，令人窒息。室内，色彩鲜艳的结婚礼物活像是打在磨得很薄的衣服上的一块块补丁。伍兹小姐并没有给彭杰带现钱来。她有造诣，讨人喜欢，与德拉姆家属于同一个阶层，英国倾向于逐年减少付给她的款项。\\n\\n “克莱夫游说去了，”她接下去说，“秋天将举行补缺选举。他终于说服了大家，让他们支持他去做候选人。”她有一套贵族的本领，能够预感到对方的批判。“说正经的，倘若他当选了，对穷人而言，是一桩极好的事。他是他们的最真实的朋友，要是他们知道该有多好。”\\n\\n 莫瑞斯点了点头，他乐意谈谈社会问题。“得训练训练那些人。”他说。\\n\\n “是啊，他们需要一位领导者。”一个柔和然而高雅的嗓音说，“他们得受苦，直到找到一位领导者。”安妮把新任的教区长博雷尼乌斯先生介绍给他，他是她本人请来的。不论任命谁，克莱夫都无所谓，只要他人品好，献身于本村的事务就行。这两个条件博雷尼乌斯先生都具备。他属于高教会派（译注：高教会派注重圣职的权威、圣餐以及仪式，是英国国教会系统中的一派），而即将离任的那位教区牧师则属于低教会派（译注：低教会派也是英国国教会系统中的一派，强调福音主义，不大重视圣餐、仪式以及圣职的权威），刚好取得平衡。\\n\\n “哎呀，博雷尼鸟斯先生，您说得多么有意思！”老夫人的喊声从屋子的另一头传过来。“可是我猜想，您的意见是我们大家都需要一位领导者，我完全同意。”她东张西望。“你们大家都需要一位领导者，可不。”博雷尼乌斯先生说罢，随着她的视线四下里打量。可能没找到他所物色的东西，过一会儿他就告辞了。\\n\\n “在教区他不会有什么可做的事。”安妮若有所思地说，“不过，他总是这样子。他上门来，为人们的住房问题申斥克莱夫一顿，连饭也不肯吃就走了。是这样的，他很敏感，为穷人忧虑。”\\n\\n “我也在跟穷人打交道，”莫瑞斯边取一片蛋糕边说，“可我不为他们忧虑。一般说来，为了国家的缘故，有必要帮助他们渡过难关，仅此而已。他们没有咱们这样的感觉。咱们要是处于他们的地位，会痛苦不堪，他们却浑然不觉。”\\n\\n 安妮好像不以为然。她却觉得自己把那一百英镑交到信得过的证券经纪人手里了。\\n\\n “我只认得球僮或贫民窟里的学院传道区的人们。不过，我还是了解到一些情况。穷人并不想让别人可怜他们。自从我戴上拳击手套，跟他们厮打以来，他们才真正喜欢我。”\\n\\n “哦，你教他们拳击。”\\n\\n “是啊，还有足球……他们是蹩脚的运动员。”\\n\\n “我想是的。博雷尼乌斯先生说他们需要爱。”安妮歇了口气说。\\n\\n “他们肯定需要，然而他们得不到。”\\n\\n “霍尔先生。”\\n\\n 莫瑞斯擦了擦小胡子，眉开眼笑。\\n\\n “你是个玩世不恭的人。”\\n\\n “我只是随便说说。我猜想听上去是这样的吧。”\\n\\n “可你喜欢做个玩世不恭的人吗？”\\n\\n “人嘛，对什么都能习以为常。”他说完，猛地转过身去，因为背后的门被风刮开了。\\n\\n “唷，我的天哪！我斥责克莱夫愤世嫉俗，但是你却超过了他。”\\n\\n “我对玩世不恭——用你的话来说广一也习以为常了。正如穷人对贫民窟那样，这只是个时间问题。”他畅所欲言。进门后，油然生出一种火辣辣的鲁莽劲头。克莱夫不屑于留在家中迎迓他。管它呢！“你东撞撞，西撞撞，随后就会对自己那个特定的窝习惯下来。起初，人人都像一群小狗似的尖叫：汪！汪！”他出乎意料地学起狗叫来，把她逗笑了。“到头来你会领悟大家都太忙，没工夫听你叫，于是你就不再叫下去了。事实如此。”\\n\\n “一个男人的看法。”她边说边点头，“我永远也不让克莱夫抱这样的观点。我认为人应该有恻隐之心。……相互提携。毫无疑问，这一套已经过时了。你是尼采的崇奉者吗？”\\n\\n “问点儿别的吧！”\\n\\n 安妮喜欢这位霍尔先生。克莱夫预先提醒过她，她也许会发现此人反应不灵敏。在某些方面他是这样的，但他显然有个性。她理解了为什么她丈夫会觉得他是意大利之行的好伙伴。“可是，你为什么讨厌穷人呢？”她突然问。\\n\\n “我并非讨厌他们。只不过是除非迫不得已，我把他们置之度外。贫民窟啦，工团主义（译注：亦称无政府工团主义或革命工团主义，主张工人阶级采取直接行动消灭资本主义制度（包括国家），建立以生产单位的工人为基础的社会制度的运动。它盛行于1900-1914年间的法国，并对西班牙、意大利、英国等有相当影响。第一次世界大战时已趋于衰落，但到第二次世界大战前，它在欧洲仍有一定的影响。）啦，以及其他的一切，是共同的威胁，为了对抗它们，每个人都应该尽绵薄之力，但不是出于爱。你的博雷尼乌斯先生没有面对现实。”\\n\\n 她沉默片刻，然后问他的年龄。\\n\\n “明天就满二十四岁了。”\\n\\n “啊，就你这个年龄而言，你非常冷酷。”\\n\\n “你刚才说我玩世不恭。你对我的判断下得太容易了，德拉姆太太！”\\n\\n “不管怎样，你是固执的，这就更糟了。”\\n\\n 她发现他皱起眉来，于是担心自己的言语过分了些，就把话题转到克莱夫身上。她说，她原以为克莱夫该回来了。由于明天克莱夫得出门，就越发令人扫兴了。熟悉选区情况的选举干事带领他四处参观。霍尔会原谅的，而且进行板球赛的时候，还得请他帮助他们呢。\\n\\n “在一定程度上，得根据其他的一些计划而定……我也许要……”\\n\\n 她突然引起好奇心，扫视着他的脸，然后说：“你不想看看你的房间吗？——阿尔赤，把霍尔先生领到赤褐屋去吧。”\\n\\n “谢谢……还能赶上发信时间吗？”\\n\\n “今天晚上赶不上了。不过，你可以打电报，就写上我们的地址好了。……我也许不该多管闲事吧？”\\n\\n “我可能得打电报——我还拿不准，非常感谢。”随后他跟着伦敦先生前往赤褐屋，边走边想：“克莱夫按说是可以……看在过去的情分上，按说他可以待在这儿迎接我。他应该知道我会多么沮丧。”他并不挂念克莱夫，但他依然会由于克莱夫的缘故遭受痛苦。大雨从铅灰色的天空上倾泻到园林里，森林万籁俱寂。黄昏时分，他陷入新一轮的苦恼。\\n\\n 他在屋子里一直等到开晚饭，跟自己曾经爱过的幽灵进行搏斗。倘若这位新大夫能够改变他的本性，他是不是有义务去一趟呢，尽管他的肉体和灵魂都会遭到亵渎也在所不辞。世界既然就是这样一个地方，人嘛，要么就得结婚，要么就腐朽掉。他尚未摆脱克莱夫，而且永远也摆脱不了，直到更重大的什么东西插进来为止。\\n\\n “德拉姆先生回来了吗？”当女仆送热水来的时候，他问道。\\n\\n “回来了，先生。”\\n\\n “刚回来吗？”\\n\\n “不，已经回来约半个小时了，先生。”\\n\\n 她拉上窗帘，把景色遮挡了，却没能遮掩雨声。这时候，莫瑞斯潦潦草草地写了电文。伦敦西区威格莫尔街六号拉斯克·琼斯请予预约挂号 星期四霍尔发自威尔特郡彭杰庄园德拉姆府\\n\\n “知道了，先生。”\\n\\n “多谢，多谢。”他恳切地说。只剩他一个人后，立即蹙起鼻子。如今，在公与私两种场合下，他的行动判若两人。踱人客厅后，他向克莱夫致意的时候，声音一点儿都没发颤。他们热烈地握手，克莱夫说：“你看上去精神抖擞。你知道你将陪伴哪一位进入餐厅吗？”并将一个姑娘介绍给他。克莱夫变成一位地地道道的乡绅了。自从结婚以来，他对社会的不满全都消失了。他们的政治观点一致-不愁没有话题。\\n\\n 从克莱夫这方面来说，他对来客感到满意。安妮品评道：“粗鲁，然而非常正派。”——情况令人称心如意。莫瑞斯有那么一种粗野的气质，但是如今这已无关紧要了。有关艾达的可怕的场面可以被遗忘。莫瑞斯与阿尔赤·伦敦也处得很好一这一点挺重要，因为阿尔赤使安妮感到厌烦。阿尔赤是那种能够给人做搭档的人。克莱夫邀请二位来作客的时候就把他们搭配在一起了。\\n\\n 在客厅里，他们又谈起了政治，使得在座的人个个都相信激进派不诚实，社会主义者发了狂。大雨滂沱，声音单调，什么也干扰不了它。会话刚一停顿，雨的沙沙声就传到客厅里来了。晚会即将结束时，雨水嘀嘀嗒嗒地落到钢琴盖上了。\\n\\n “咱们家的幽灵又来啦。”德拉姆老夫人嫣然一笑说。\\n\\n “顶棚里有个最可爱的洞。”安妮大声说。“克莱夫，咱们能不能把它保留下来？”\\n\\n “咱们只能这样做。”他边按铃边回答。“不过，咱们把钢琴挪开吧。它可经受不了雨淋。”\\n\\n “放只碟子如何？”伦敦先生说。“克莱夫，一只碟子如何？有一次，俱乐部的顶棚漏雨，我按了铃，仆人就拿来了一只碟子。”\\n\\n “我呢，按了铃，可是仆人什么也没拿来。”克莱夫说着，又按铃。“好的，咱们放一只碟子，阿尔赤。但咱们非把钢琴挪开不可。安妮的可爱的小洞也许会在夜里变大了。客厅的这部分，只搭了个单坡屋顶而已。”\\n\\n “可怜的彭杰！”他的母亲说。大家都站起来了，仰望着漏洞。安妮着手把吸墨纸伸到钢琴内部去吸水。晚会结束了，雨漏下来向他们暗示自己的存在，他们尽情地开雨的玩笑来取乐。\\n\\n “你端个盆来好吗？”当女仆应铃声而至的时候，克莱夫说，“还要一块抹布。喊个男的来，帮助把开间（译注：开间是建筑物立面上竖向两柱之间或平面上两排柱子或柱墩之间的整个空间）里的钢琴搬开，地毯也撤掉。雨又漏下来了。”\\n\\n “我们不得不按两下铃，按了两下呢。”他的母亲表示了一点儿意见。\\n\\n 女仆回来的时候，除了男管家，把猎场看守也领来了。于是她接下去说：“这才明白为什么耽误了，一向都是这样的（译注：原文为法语）——要知道，咱们在楼下也有小小的轻松浪漫场面。”\\n\\n “诸位，你们明天想干什么？”克莱夫对客人们说。“我得去游说，用不着跟我去。再也没有如此枯燥乏味的了。愿意带支猎枪出去一趟吗，怎么样？”\\n\\n “好得很。”莫瑞斯和阿尔赤说。\\n\\n “斯卡德，你听见了吗？”\\n\\n “好男儿心不在焉。（译注：原文为法语）”他的母亲说。钢琴勾住了地毯，仆人们顾忌当着绅士淑女的面提高嗓门，误会了彼此的吩咐，动作不协调，于是相互悄声问：“什么？”\\n\\n “斯卡德，客人们明天要去打猎。不知能打到什么。我没把握。你在十点钟到这儿来。咱们现在去睡觉吧？”\\n\\n “这儿的习惯是早睡，这你是知道的，霍尔先生。”安妮说。随后她向三个仆人道了晚安，率先沿着楼梯走上去。莫瑞斯留下来，选了一本书。莱基（译注：威廉·爱德华·哈特波尔·莱基（1838-1903）是爱尔兰历史学家。《理性主义史》一书深受熟悉达尔文进化论的读者们的欢迎）的《理性主义史》能够填补空白吗？雨水滴到盆里，两个男仆在开间里的地毯上俯身嘀咕着。他们跪在那儿，就像是举行葬礼似的。\\n\\n “该死，什么都没有吗，没有吗？”\\n\\n “——嘘，他不是对咱们说的。”男管家对猎场看守说。\\n\\n 那是莱基的著作。然而他的脑子不灵，读不进去。几分钟后，他把它丢在床上，暗自思忖电报的事。处在彭杰的阴郁气氛下，求医的决心更坚定了。人生被证实是条死胡同，尽头是一堆污泥。他必须回到起点，重新做起。里斯利曾暗示，人只要毫不在乎过去，就能脱胎换骨，彻底改变。再见吧，美与温暖。它们到头来化为污泥，非清除掉不可。他拉开窗帘，朝着雨凝视良久，叹口气，咬紧嘴唇。\\n\\n \\n\\n
