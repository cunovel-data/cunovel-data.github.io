{"id":4628,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"All that day and the next Maurice was planning how he could see this queer fish again. The chances were bad. He did not like to call on a senior-year man, and they were at different colleges. Risley, he gathered, was well known at the Union, and he went to the Tuesday debate in the hope of hear-ing him: perhaps he would be easier to understand in public. He was not attracted to the man in the sense that he wanted him for a friend, but he did feel he might help him—how, he didn\u0027t formulate. It was all very obscure, for the mountains still overshadowed Maurice. Risley, surely capering on the summit, might stretch him a helping hand. Having failed at the Union, he had a reaction. He didn\u0027t want anyone\u0027s help; he was all right. Besides, none of his friends would stand Risley, and he must stick to his friends. But the re-action soon passed, and he longed to see him more than ever. Since Risley was so odd, might he not be odd too, and break all the undergraduate conventions by calling? One \"ought to be human\", and it was a human sort of thing to call. Much struck by the discovery, Maurice decided to be Bohemian also, and to enter the room making a witty speech in Risley\u0027s own style. \"You\u0027ve bargained for more than you\u0027ve gained\" occurred to him. It didn\u0027t sound very good, but Risley had been clever at not letting him feel a fool, so he would fire it off if inspired to nothing better, and leave the rest to luck. For it had become an adventure. This man who said one ought to \"talk, talk\" had stirred Maurice incomprehensibly. One night, just before ten o\u0027clock, he slipped into Trinity and waited in the Great Court until the gates were shut behind him. Look-ing up, he noticed the night. He was indifferent to beauty as a rule, but \"what a show of stars!\" he thought. And how the foun-tain splashed when the chimes died away, and the gates and doors all over Cambridge had been fastened up. Trinity men were around him—all of enormous intellect and culture. Maur-ice\u0027s set had laughed at Trinity, but they could not ignore its dis-dainful radiance, or deny the superiority it scarcely troubles to affirm. He had come to it without their knowledge, humbly, to ask its help. His witty speech faded in its atmosphere; and his heart beat violently. He was ashamed and afraid. Risley\u0027s rooms were at the end of a short passage; which since it contained no obstacle was unlighted, and visitors slid along the wall until they hit the door. Maurice hit it sooner than he ex-pected—a most awful whack—and exclaimed \"Oh damnation\" loudly, while the panels quivered. \"Come in,\" said a voice. Disappointment awaited him. The speaker was a man of his own college, by name Durham. Risley was out. \"Do you want Mr Risley? Hullo, Hall!\" \"Hullo! Where\u0027s Risley?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s nothing. I\u0027ll go.\" \"Are you going back into college?\" asked Durham without looking up: he was kneeling over a castle of pianola records on the floor. \"I suppose so, as he isn\u0027t here. It wasn\u0027t anything particular.\" \"Wait a sec, and I\u0027ll come too. I\u0027m sorting out the Pathetic Symphony.\" Maurice examined Risley\u0027s room and wondered what would have been said in it, and then sat on the table and looked at Durham. He was a small man—very small—with simple man-ners and a fair face, which had flushed when Maurice blundered in. In the college he had a reputation for brains and also for exclusiveness. Almost the only thing Maurice had heard about him was that he \"went out too much\", and this meeting in Trin-ity confirmed it. \"I can\u0027t find the March,\" he said. \"Sorry.\" \"All right.\" \"I\u0027m borrowing them to play on Fetherstonhaugh\u0027s pianola.\" \"Under me.\" \"Have you come into college, Hall?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m beginning my second year.\" \"Oh yes, of course, I\u0027m third.\" He spoke without arrogance, and Maurice, forgetting due honour to seniority, said, \"You look more like a fresher than a third-year man, I must say.\" \"I may do, but I feel like an M.A.\" Maurice regarded him attentively. \"Risley\u0027s an amazing chap,\" he continued. Maurice did not reply. \"But all the same a little of him goes a long way.\" \"Still you don\u0027t mind borrowing his things.\" He looked up again. \"Oughtn\u0027t I to?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m only ragging, of course,\" said Maurice, slipping off the table. \"Have you found that music yet?\" \"No.\" \"Because I must be going\"; he was in no hurry, but his heart, which had never stopped beating quickly, impelled him to say this. \"Oh. All right.\" This was not what Maurice had intended. \"What is it you want?\" he asked, advancing. \"The March out of the Pathetique—\" \"That means nothing to me. So you like this style of music.\" \"I do.\" \"A good waltz is more my style.\" \"Mine too,\" said Durham, meeting his eye. As a rule Maurice shifted, but he held firm on this occasion. Then Durham said, \"The other movement may be in that pile over by the window. I must look. I shan\u0027t be long.\" Maurice said resolutely, \"I must go now.\" \"All right, I\u0027ll stop.\" Beaten and lonely, Maurice went. The stars blurred, the night had turned towards rain. But while the porter was getting the keys at the gate he heard quick footsteps behind him. \"Got your March?\" \"No, I thought I\u0027d come along with you instead.\" Maurice walked a few steps in silence, then said, \"Here, give me some of those things to carry.\" \"I\u0027ve got them safe.\" \"Give,\" he said roughly, and jerked the records from under Durham\u0027s arm. No other conversation passed. On reaching their own college they went straight to Fetherstonhaugh\u0027s room, for there was time to try a little music over before eleven o\u0027clock. Durham sat down at the pianola. Maurice knelt beside him. \"Didn\u0027t know you were in the aesthetic push, Hall,\" said the host. \"I\u0027m not—I want to hear what they\u0027re up to.\" Durham began, then desisted, saying he would start with the 5/4 instead. \"Why?\" \"It\u0027s nearer waltzes.\" \"Oh, never mind that. Play what you like. Don\u0027t go shifting— it wastes time.\" But he could not get his way this time. When he put his hand on the roller Durham said, \"You\u0027ll tear it, let go,\" and fixed the 5/4 instead. Maurice listened carefully to the music. He rather liked it. \"You ought to be this end,\" said Fetherstonhaugh, who was working by the fire. \"You should get away from the machine as far as you can.\" \"I think so—Would you mind playing it again if Fetherston-haugh doesn\u0027t mind?\" \"Yes, do, Durham. It is a jolly thing.\" Durham refused. Maurice saw that he was not pliable. He said, \"A movement isn\u0027t like a separate piece—you can\u0027t repeat it\"—an unintelligible excuse, but apparently valid. He played the Largo, which was far from jolly, and then eleven struck and Fetherstonhaugh made them tea. He and Durham were in for the same Tripos, and talked shop, while Maurice listened. His excitement had never ceased. He saw that Durham was not only clever, but had a tranquil and orderly brain. He knew what he wanted to read, where he was weak, and how far the officials could help him. He had neither the blind faith in tutors and lec-tures that was held by Maurice and his set nor the contempt professed by Fetherstonhaugh. \"You can always learn some-thing from an older man, even if he hasn\u0027t read the latest Ger-mans.\" They argued a little about Sophocles, then in low water Durham said it was a pose in \"us undergraduates\" to ignore him and advised Fetherstonhaugh to re-read theAjax with his eye on the characters rather than the author; he would learn more that way, both about Greek grammar and lif e. Maurice regretted all this. He had somehow hoped to find the man unbalanced. Fetherstonhaugh was a great person, both in brain and brawn, and had a trenchant and copious manner. But Durham listened unmoved, shook out the falsities and approved the rest. What hope for Maurice who was nothing but falsities? A stab of anger went through him. Jumping up, he said good night, to regret his haste as soon as he was outside the door. He settled to wait, not on the staircase itself, for this struck him as absurd, but somewhere between its foot and Durham\u0027s own room. Going out into the court, he located the latter, even knocking at the door, though he knew the owner was absent,, and looking in he studied furniture and pictures in the firelight. Then he took his stand on a sort of bridge in the courtyard. Un-fortunately it was not a real bridge: it only spanned a slight de-pression in the ground, which the architect had tried to utilize in his effect. To stand on it was to feel in a photographic studio, and the parapet was too low to lean upon. Still, with a pipe in his mouth, Maurice looked fairly natural, and hoped it wouldn\u0027t rain. The lights were out, except in Fetherstonhaugh\u0027s room. Twelve struck, then a quarter past. For a whole hour he might have been watching for Durham. Presently there was a noise on the staircase and the neat little figure ran out with a gown round its throat and books in its hand. It was the moment for which he had waited, but he found himself strolling away. Dur-ham went to his rooms behind him. The opportunity was pass-ing. \"Good night,\" he screamed; his voice was going out of gear, and startling them both. \"Who\u0027s that? Good night, Hall. Taking a stroll before bed?\" \"I generally do. You don\u0027t want any more tea, I suppose?\" \"Do I? No, perhaps it\u0027s a bit late for tea.\" Rather tepidly he added, \"Like some whisky though?\" \"Have you a drop?\" leaped from Maurice. \"Yes—come in. Here I keep: ground floor.\" \"Oh, here!\" Durham turned on the light. The fire was nearly out now. He told Maurice to sit down and brought up a table with glasses. \"Say when?\" \"Thanks—most awfully, most awfully.\" \"Soda or plain?\" he asked, yawning. \"Soda,\" said Maurice. But it was impossible to stop, for the man was tired and had only invited him out of civility. He drank and returned to his own room, where he provided himself with plenty of tobacco and went into the court again. It was absolutely quiet now, and absolutely dark. Maurice walked to and fro on the hallowed grass, himself noiseless, his heart glowing. The rest of him fell asleep, bit by bit, and first of all his brain, his weakest organ. His body followed, then his feet carried him upstairs to escape the dawn. But his heart had lit never to be quenched again, and one thing in him at last was real. Next morning he was calmer. He had a cold for one thing, the rain having soaked him unnoticed, and for another he had overslept to the extent of missing a chapel and two lectures. It was impossible to get his life straight. After lunch he changed for football, and being in good time flung himself on his sofa to sleep till tea. But he was not hungry. Refusing an invitation, he strolled out into the town and, meeting a Turkish bath, had one. It cured his cold, but made him late for another lecture. When hall came, he felt he could not face the mass of Old Sunning-tonians, and, though he had not signed off, absented himself, and dined alone at the Union. He saw Risley there, but with indif-ference. Then the evening began again, and he found to his sur-prise that he was very clear-headed, and could do six hours\u0027 work in three. He went to bed at his usual time, and woke up healthy and very happy. Some instinct, deep below his con-sciousness, had advised him to let Durham and his thoughts about Durham have a twenty-four-hours\u0027 rest. They began to see a little of one another. Durham asked him to lunch, and Maurice asked him back, but not too soon. A caution alien to his nature was at work. He had always been cautious pettily, but this was on a large scale. He became alert, and all his actions that October term might be described in the language of battle. He would not venture on to difficult ground. He spied out Durham\u0027s weaknesses as well as his strength. And above all he exercised and cleaned his powers. If obliged to ask himself, \"What\u0027s all this?\" he would have re-plied, \"Durham is another of those boys in whom I was inter-ested at school,\" but he was obliged to ask nothing, and merely went ahead with his mouth and his mind shut. Each day with its contradictions slipped into the abyss, and he knew that he was gaining ground. Nothing else mattered. If he worked well and was nice socially, it was only a by-product, to which he had de-voted no care. To ascend, to stretch a hand up the mountainside until a hand catches it, was the end for which he had been bom. He forgot the hysteria of his first night and his stranger recov-ery. They were steps which he kicked behind him. He never even thought of tenderness and emotion; his considerations about Durham remained cold. Durham didn\u0027t dislike him, he was sure. That was all he wanted. One thing at a time. He didn\u0027t so much as have hopes, for hope distracts, and he had a great deal to see to. 当天和第二天，莫瑞斯一直在盘算怎样才能再度见到这个怪人。机会太少了。他不愿意去拜访高班学生，而且他们又在不同的学院。他断定里斯利在学生联合会（译注：学生联合会既具有俱乐部性质（有餐厅，还经常举行舞会），同时也是英国议会政治的摇篮，每周都举行辩论会。）尽人皆知，就去参加星期二的辩论会，指望能听到里斯利的发言。也许在大庭广众之下更容易理解他。莫瑞斯不是在想跟里斯利交朋友的心情下被他所吸引的，但他感到里斯利能帮助他也未可知——究竟如何帮助，他就想不出来了。一切都朦朦胧胧，因为他依然在山岭的阴影下。里斯利想必正在山顶上跳跃嬉戏，说不定能助他一臂之力。 他在学生联合会未能如愿以偿，就产生了一种逆反心理。他不需要任何人的帮助，他这样就挺好。再说，他的朋友们没有一个能容忍里斯利，他必须忠于自己的朋友。然而这种逆反心理很快就消失了，他比原来更渴望见到里斯利。既然里斯利如此古怪，他何不也来个古怪之举，打破大学本科生的一切惯例，去拜访他？“应该做个男子汉”，去拜访是男子汉份内之事。莫瑞斯被这一发现所打动，决定也做个放荡不羁的人，一走进里斯利的房间，就用里斯利的腔调发表妙趣横生的演说。他想到一句话：“你原想获得更大的成果。”听上去并不十分精彩，里斯利很精明，不要让他觉得自己是个蠢人。除非灵机一动，能想起更俏皮的话，听天由命吧。 这变成一种冒险了。那个人说，人们应该“谈话，谈话”，使得莫瑞斯莫名其妙地激动起来。一个夜晚，快要到十点钟的时候，他溜进三一学院，在大院子里一直等到大门在他身后关闭。他抬头望望夜空。通常他对美漠不关心，这时却想着“满天星斗！”报时的钟声已响过，剑桥校园内所有的门都关严了，随后传到耳际的喷泉迸溅声何等清越。周围都是三一学院的学生们——极有才智，教养非常好。莫瑞斯的伙伴们尽管嘲笑三一学院，却决不能无视三一学院散发出的自负的光辉。也决不能对三一学院所不屑于被认可的优越一笑置之。他是背着伙伴们到三一学院来的，是谦虚地来向它求助的。在学院的这种气氛下，他那俏皮的台词消失了，他的心怦怦直跳，既羞愧又害怕。 里斯利的套房位于短短的走廊尽头。什么障碍物也没有，走廊也就没点灯。来客沿墙而行，直到撞上门为止。莫瑞斯比自己所预料的更快地撞上了它——咣当一声巨响——墙板震颤起来。于是他惊叫道：“该死！” “请进！”屋里有人说。失望等待着他，说话的是跟他同学院的人，名叫德拉姆。里斯利出门了。 “你要找里斯利先生吗？嘿，是霍尔呀！” “嘿！里斯利去哪儿啦？” “我不知道。” “啊，没关系，我回去了。” “你要回咱们学院去吗？”德拉姆头也不抬地问道。他跪在地板上，摆弄一摞自动钢琴（译注：自动钢琴：在一卷卷纸上按音符时值和音高穿凿出大小不一的孔，演奏时，空气被压入孔中，推动琴槌击弦发声。十九世纪晚期开始流行，直到留声机和无线电问世为止。）用的唱片。 “我想既然他不在，没有什么特别的事。” “稍等一会儿，我也一起回去。我正在找《悲怆交响曲》（译注：《悲怆》是俄国作曲家柴可夫斯基（1840-1893）的B小调第六交响曲的副标题。）。” 莫瑞斯四下里打量着里斯利的屋子，寻思着在这里究竟都谈过些什么呢？然后坐在桌子上，瞧着德拉姆。他个子矮小——非常小——态度自然，皮肤白皙。当莫瑞斯跌跌撞撞地走进去时，他飞红了脸。在学院里，他以脑筋好以及孤傲著称。关于他，莫瑞斯只听说是“太爱到外头去走动”。在三一学院与他相逢，证实了这一点。 “我找不到《进行曲》。（译注：指《悲怆交响曲》第三乐章，是一首谐谑曲，富于进行曲的特征。）”他说，“对不起，叫你久等了。” “不要紧。” “我借几张，放在费瑟斯顿豪的自动钢琴上听。” “他就住在我楼下。” “你入了学院吗，霍尔？” “嗯，我刚升二年级。” “啊，当然。我是三年级。” 德拉姆的口气一点儿都不狂妄，莫瑞斯忘记了对高班生所应表示的敬意，说道：“依我看，与其说是三年级，你更像是个一年级的学生。” “也许是这样。可我觉得自己像是个文学硕士。 莫瑞斯留心地端详他。 “里斯利是个了不起的家伙。”他继续说下去。 莫瑞斯没有吱声。 “尽管如此，偶尔见一次面，也就够了。” “不过，你还照样跑来向他借东西。” 他又抬起头来看。“这么做不合适吗？”他问。 “我只是开玩笑而已。”莫瑞斯边说边从桌子上滑下来。“你找到那张唱片了吗？” “没有。” “因为我得走啦一”其实他并不急于离开，然而他的心一个劲儿地怦怦直跳，以致非这么说不可。 “哦，好的。” 莫瑞斯没想到他会这么回答。“你在找什么呢？”他边往前走边问。 “《悲怆》里的《进行曲》。” “我一点都不懂。那么，你喜欢这种风格的音乐喽？” “喜欢。” “我更喜欢的风格是活泼的华尔兹舞曲。” “我也一样。”德拉姆说，他与莫瑞斯四目相视。莫瑞斯通常会把目光移开，然而这次却直勾勾地望着。于是德拉姆说：“其他乐章也许在窗边的那一摞里，我得去瞧瞧，耽误不了多会儿。” 莫瑞斯坚决地说：“我必须马上走。” “好吧，我这就停下来。” 莫瑞斯走出去了，颓丧而孤独。星星已模糊不清，天空像要下雨。当门房正找大门钥匙时，他听见背后传来急促的脚步声。 “找到你的《进行曲》了吗？” “没有。我改变了主意，打算跟你一起回去。” 莫瑞斯默默地走了几步，随后说：“喏，我帮你拿一些。” “我拿得了。” “给我。”他粗鲁地说，并将唱片从德拉姆的腋下一把夺过来。他们没再交谈，返回自己的学院后，他们径直到费瑟斯顿豪的房间去了。因为在十一点以前，他们还能试听一会儿音乐。德拉姆坐在自动钢琴前的凳子上，莫瑞斯屈膝跪在他旁边。 “没想到你也是艺术伙伴中的一个，霍尔。”房间的主人说。 “我可不是一我想听听这里面都有些什么。” 自动钢琴开始演奏，又停止了。德拉姆说他要调成四分之五拍。 “为什么？” “那更接近华尔兹舞曲。” “啊，这没关系，随意演奏吧。别调了——太浪费时间了。” 然而这一次他却未能固执己见。他刚将自己的手放在滚轴上，德拉姆就说：“放手，你会把它损坏的。”并把琴调成了四分之五拍。 莫瑞斯专注地听着，他颇为喜爱这个乐曲。 “你应该到这边来，”正在炉火边用功的费瑟斯顿豪说，“尽量地离琴远一点才好。” “有道理——倘若费瑟斯顿豪不介意，可不可以再奏一遍？” “我没关系，德拉姆，再奏一遍吧。多么愉快的音乐。” 德拉姆拒绝了，莫瑞斯看出他不是个顺从的人。他说：“乐章不是独立的乐曲——不能重复地听。”这是个莫名其妙的借口，但显然站得住脚。德拉姆接着又奏了《广板》（译注：《广板》系德国作曲家亨德尔（1685-1759）所作乐曲。通常用以指别人改编的许多动听的器乐曲，是从亨德尔的歌剧《赛尔斯》中的《绿树青葱》咏叹调改编而成（其实谱上原来标的是“小广板”）。），一点也不快活。随后时钟敲了十一下，费瑟斯顿豪给他们沏了茶。他和德拉姆双双准备参加荣誉学位考试，就谈起专业来，莫瑞斯聆听着。他始终兴奋不已。他看得出德拉姆不仅才思敏捷，还具备沉着、有条理的思维。他知道自己想要读什么书，有哪方面的弱点，校方能够给他多大的帮助。莫瑞斯及其伙伴们对导师与讲义盲目信赖，德拉姆却不然。但他也不像费瑟斯顿豪那样，对导师与讲义抱着轻蔑的态度。“你总可以从年长的人身上学到一些东西，即便他没读过最近出版的德文书籍。”关于索福克勒斯（译注：索福克勒斯（约前496一约前406），古希腊三大悲剧诗人之一。他的传世剧作是《埃阿斯》（约公元前441）等。），他们争论了一会儿。德拉姆有点儿招架不住了，提出“我们这些本科生”忽视索福克勒斯，这是附庸风雅。他劝告费瑟斯顿豪重读《埃阿斯》，别去注意作者，宁肯把两眼盯在登场人物上。这样来读，不论关于希腊文法还是希腊人的生活，都能学到更多的东西。 这番争论使莫瑞斯感到沮丧。不知为什么，他曾指望能发现德拉姆的情绪不稳。费瑟斯顿豪是个优秀的人物，脑筋好，肌肉发达-直言不讳，喋喋不休。然而德拉姆冷静地听，将谬误提出来，对其余的表示同意。莫瑞斯简直就是谬误的化身，他有什么希望呢？愤怒的利刃刺穿了他的身子。他跳起来道了声“晚安”，可是刚一走出屋子，就懊悔自己不该这么性急。他决定等候，不是在楼梯上等，因为他觉得这样很可笑，还是在楼梯脚与德拉姆的房屋之间等吧。他走到院子里，找到了德拉姆那间屋子，明知道主人不在，却还敲了敲门，并打开门探了探头，借着炉火的光仔细端详家具和墙上挂的画。然后就去站在院子里的一座徒有其名的桥上。遗憾的是那不是真正的桥，只是庭园设计师为了效果起见，把它架设在一片洼地上而已。在上面一站，就会有待在照相馆的摄影室里那样的感觉。栏杆太矮，不能凭靠。不过，莫瑞斯口衔烟斗，看上去颇像是站在真桥上似的，他希望不要下雨。 除了费瑟斯顿豪的屋子，所有的灯光都熄了。时钟敲了十二下，接着十二点一刻也过去了。他可能已等候了德拉姆一个钟头。过了一会儿，楼梯响了，一个矮小文雅的身姿，他穿着大学礼服，手捧书籍跑了出来。莫瑞斯所等待的正是这一瞬间，他却不由自主地移步走开。德拉姆在他后面，走向自己的屋子。他正在错过机会。 “晚安！”他尖声喊叫，刺耳的声音使两个人都大吃一惊。 “谁？晚安，霍尔。睡觉前散散步吗？” “我通常都这样。你不想再喝茶了吧？” “我吗？不，现在喝茶或许太晚了些。”他不大热情地补上一句，“不过，来点儿威士忌如何？” “你有吗？”莫瑞斯赶紧说。 “对，请进。我就住在这儿，一楼。” “哦，这儿！”德拉姆把灯捻亮了。这会儿壁炉里的火已经快燃尽了。他叫莫瑞斯坐下，并把桌子和玻璃杯端过来。 “要多少？” “多谢一足够了，足够了。” “兑苏打水还是喝纯的？”他边打哈欠边问。 “兑苏打水。”莫瑞斯说。他不便久坐，因为德拉姆疲倦了，只是出于礼貌才邀他进屋的。他喝完以后回到自己的房间去了。他在屋里吸了大量的烟，又重新来到了院子里。 万籁俱寂，一团漆黑。莫瑞斯在圣洁的草坪上来回踱步，毫无声息，心里热辣辣的。身体的其他部位一点点地睡着了，首先进入梦乡的是他的头脑——最弱的器官。他的肉体接着入睡，随后他的两只脚将他送上楼，以便逃避拂晓。心中被点燃的火永远也不会被熄灭，他身上终于有了个真实的部位。 第二天早晨，他心里渐渐宁静下来。因为前天晚上淋了雨，他患了感冒，并且睡过了头。非但没去做礼拜，还旷了两堂课。让他的生活步人正轨已经不可能了。午饭后，他换了衣服准备去踢足球，看看时间还充裕，便躺在了沙发上。结果一直睡到喝茶的时间。他并不饿，拒绝一个邀请后溜达到了大街上，去洗了一个蒸汽浴。这治好了他的感冒，结果又旷了一堂课。该到大餐厅吃饭了，他却无心跟萨宁顿的老校友们碰头。他不曾事先打招呼，擅自缺了席，并孤零零地在学生联合会吃了顿饭。他在那儿看见了里斯利，但他对里斯利很冷漠。夜幕又降临了。莫瑞斯发现自己思维非常敏捷，三个小时就能做完六个小时的功课，令自己大吃一惊。他按平时的就寝时间上了床，一觉醒来，身体健康，心情非常愉快。潜在意识深处的一种本能劝他在二十四小时之内别再去想德拉姆以及有关德拉姆的事。 从此，他们二人偶尔见见面。德拉姆请莫瑞斯吃午饭，莫瑞斯再回请一次。他的天性中所没有的谨慎在起作用，他一向不在这方面下工夫，这次可是极其谨慎。他变得很警惕，从十月开始的这个学期，他所有的行为都可以用“斗争”一词来描述，但决不涉足危险领域。他窥探到了德拉姆的长处以及弱点。尤其重要的是，他锻炼并加强了自己的能力。 倘若被迫问自己：“这是在干什么？”他就会回答说：“德拉姆是我所感兴趣的。”然而他没有问过自己，仅仅是闭着嘴，关上心扉，径直往前走。光阴日复一日，连同种种矛盾，消逝到深渊中。他知道自己有所进展，其余的全都无所谓。倘若他很用功，跟同学相处得很好，那都是连带反应而已，他根本不放在心上。向上爬，朝着山腰伸出手去，直到某人的手抓住它。他就是为了达到这个目的而生下来的。他忘掉了第一个夜晚自己那种病态的兴奋，以及更奇妙的康复。那是他在告别过去。他的心境与温存、感情完全无关，想到德拉姆的时候，他是冷静的。他深信德拉姆并不讨厌他，对他来说，这就足够了。一步一个脚印，他甚至没有抱什么希望。因为希望会使他分神，而他不得不关照的事太多了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/313/433.html","bookId":162,"book":{"id":162,"title":"莫瑞斯
