{"id":4639,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"It seems strange that Maurice should have won any respect from the Durham family, but they did not dislike him. They only disliked people who wanted to know them well—it was a positive mania—and the rumour that a man wished to enter county society was a sufficient reason for ex-cluding him from it. Inside (region of high interchange and dignified movements that meant nothing) were to be found several who, like Mr Hall, neither loved their fate nor feared it, and would depart without a sigh if necessary. The Durhams felt they were conferring a favour on him by treating him as one of themselves, yet were pleased he should take it as a matter of course, gratitude being mysteriously connected in their minds with ill breeding. Wanting only his food and his friend, Maurice did not observe he was a success, and was surprised when the old lady claimed him for a talk towards the end of his visit. She had questioned him about his family and discovered the riakedness thereof, but this time her manner was deferential: she wanted his opinion of Clive. \"Mr Hall, we wish you to help us: Clive thinks so much of you. Do you consider it wise for him to stop up a fourth year at Cambridge?\" Maurice was wanting to wonder which horse he should ride in the afternoon: he only half attended, which gave an appear-ance of profundity. \"After the deplorable exhibition he has made of himself in the Tripos—is it wise?\" \"He means to,\" said Maurice. Mrs Durham nodded. \"There you have gone to the root of the matter. Clive means to. Well, he is his own master. This place is his. Did he tell you?\" \"No.\" \"Oh, Penge is his absolutely, under my husband\u0027s will. I must move to the dower house as soon as he marries—\" Maurice started; she looked at him and saw that he had col-oured. \"So thereis some girl,\" she thought. Neglecting the point for a moment, she returned to Cambridge, and observed how little a fourth year would profit a \"yokel\"—she used the word with gay assurance—and how desirable it was that Clive should take his place in the countryside. There was the game, there were his tenants, there were finally politics. \"His father repre-sented the division, as you doubtless know.\" \"No.\" \"What does he talk to you about?\" she laughed. \"Anyhow, my husband was a member for seven years, and though a Lib is in now, one knows that cannot last. All our old friends are looking to him. But he must take his place, he must fit himself, and what on earth is the good of all this—I forget what—advanced work. He ought to spend the year travelling instead. He must go to America and if possible the Colonies. It has become absolutely indispensable.\" \"He speaks of travelling after Cambridge. He wants me to \"Itrust you will—but not Greece, Mr Hall. That is travelling for play. Do dissuade him from Italy and Greece.\" \"I\u0027d prefer America myself.\" \"Naturally—anyone sensible would; but he\u0027s a student—a dreamer—Pippa says he writes verse. Have you seen any?\" Maurice had seen a poem to himself. Conscious that life grew daily more amazing, he said nothing. Was he the same man who eight months back had been puzzled by Risley? What had deep-ened his vision? Section after section the armies of humanity were coming alive. Alive, but slightly absurd; they misunder-stoodhim so utterly: they exposed their weakness when they thought themselves most acute. He could not help smiling. \"You evidently have . . .\" Then suddenly \"Mr Hall, is there anyone? Some Newnham girl? Pippa declares there is.\" \"Pippa had better ask then,\" Maurice replied. Mrs Durham was impressed. He had met one impertinence with another. Who would have expected such skill in a young man? He seemed even indifferent to his victory, and was smil-ing to one of the other guests, who approached over the lawn to tea. In the tones that she reserved for an equal she said, \"Im-press on him about America anyhow. He needs reality. I noticed that last year.\" Maurice duly impressed, when they were riding through the glades alone. \"I thought you were going down,\" was Clive\u0027s comment. \"Like them. They wouldn\u0027t look at Joey.\" Clive was in full reaction against his family, he hated the worldliness that they combined with complete ignorance of the World. \"These children will be a nuisance,\" he remarked during a canter. \"What children?\" \"Mine! The need of an heir for Penge. My mother calls it marriage, but that was all she was thinking of.\" Maurice was silent. It had not occurred to him before that neither he nor his friend would leave life behind them. \"I shall be worried eternally. They\u0027ve always some girl stay-ing in the house as it is.\" \"Just go on growing old—\" \"Eh, boy?\" \"Nothing,\" said Maurice, and reined up. An immense sadness —he believed himself beyond such irritants—had risen up in his soul. He and the beloved would vanish utterly—would con-tinue neither in Heaven nor on Earth. They had won past the conventions, but Nature still faced them, saying with even voice, \"Very well, you are thus; I blame none of my children. But you must go the way of all sterility.\" The thought that he was sterile weighed on the young man with a sudden shame. His mother or Mrs Durham might lack mind or heart, but they had done visible work; they had handed on the torch their sons would tread out. He had meant not to trouble Clive, but out it all came as soon as they lay down in the fern. Clive did not agree. \"Why chil-dren?\" he asked. \"Why always children? For love to end where it begins is far more beautiful, and Nature knows it.\" \"Yes, but if everyone—\" Clive pulled him back into themselves. He murmured some-thing about Eternity in an hour: Maurice did not understand, but the voice soothed him. 莫瑞斯能够赢得德拉姆家族的敬意似乎是奇妙的，他们并不讨厌他。他们只厌恶——而且简直到了偏执狂的程度——那些想跟他们套交情的人；倘若风传某人希望进入乡绅社交界，就有足够的理由对他施以闭门羹。在内部（这是由高姿态的礼尚往来与威严的举止构成的领域，毫无意义）能找到几位像霍尔先生这样的人：对他们的好运抱着不卑不亢的态度，必要的时候就告辞，连气都不叹一声。德拉姆家族认为，把他当作家庭成员之一予以招待，是对他赏光，他处之泰然，这又中了他们的意。在他们的心目中，表示谢意莫名其妙地是与缺乏教养联系在一起的。 莫瑞斯所要的只是食物和他的友人，对自己取得的成功浑然不觉。当他的逗留期即将结束时，老夫人要求跟他谈一次话，使他吃了一惊。关于他的家族，她早就讯问过，已了如指掌。然而这一次，她是谦逊地对待他的：关于克莱夫，她想听听他的意见。 “霍尔先生，我们想请你帮帮忙。克莱夫非常看重你。你认为他在剑桥待上第四年，这明智吗？” 莫瑞斯满脑子都是下午该骑哪匹马的事，所以心不在焉，但却显出很深沉的样子。 “这可是在文学士学位考试时当众出丑之后啊——这明智吗？” “他要这么做。”莫瑞斯说。 德拉姆夫人点了点头。“你这是一语破的。克莱夫要这么做。喏，他是不受任何人牵制的。这份家当是他的，他告诉过你吗？” “没有。” “根据我丈夫的遗嘱，彭杰全部归他所有。只要他一结婚，我就搬到寡妇房里去……” 莫瑞斯吃了一惊。她看了看他，发现他双颊通红。“那么，有女友了。”她猜测。她姑且把这个话题撇开，又回到剑桥上，说对一个“乡巴佬”——她是爽朗、满怀信心地使用这个词的——而言，念第四年书，益处太少了。要是克莱夫在乡间占有他自己的位置，那该多么可心啊。这里有猎场，有他那些佃户，最后还有政治。“他父亲代表这个选区参加了议会，你肯定是知道的。” “不知道。” “他都跟你谈些什么呀？”她笑了。“不管怎样，我丈夫担任过七年议员。尽管眼下自由党在当政，谁都知道不会持续很久。我们所有的老朋友统统指望着他，但他务必占有自己的位置，务必适应下来。这一切——它叫什么来着——研究院什么的，到底有什么用呢？他应该去旅行一年。他必须到美国去一趟，如果可能的话，再到那些殖民地去转转。已经到了势在必行的地步。” “他说，从剑桥毕业之后就去旅行。他要我一起去。” “我相信你们会去的——可别到希腊去，霍尔先生。那是娱乐之旅。千万劝阻他，别去意大利和希腊。” “我本人也更喜欢美国。” “当然喽——任何一个通情达理的人都会如此；但他是个学者——一个空想家——皮帕说他还写诗呢。你看到过吗？” 莫瑞斯看到过献给他本人的一首诗。他察觉到生活日益变得令人惊异，于是默不作声。八个月以前，里斯利曾使他大惑不解，难道自己仍是同一个人吗？究竟是什么扩大了他的视野呢？生气勃勃的人一群群地出现在他的视野里。生气勃勃，然而有点儿愚蠢。他们彻头彻尾误解了他。他们自以为最敏锐的时候，暴露了弱点。他不禁面泛微笑。 “你显然看到过……”接着，她突然说，“霍尔先生，他有什么人吗？是纽恩汉姆（译注：小说的时代背景为20世纪初期。除了纽恩汉姆学院（建于1871年）以外，剑桥大学的各所学院当时只收男生。以后又为女子创立了新大厅学院（建于1954年）和露西·卡文迪什学院（建于1965年）。这三所学院至今只收女生。到1987年为止，其他28所学院已陆续改为男女合校。）的姑娘吗？皮帕说他有个女友。” “那么，皮帕最好还是问一句。”莫瑞斯回答。 德拉姆夫人对他感到钦佩。他出言不逊，以反击不逊。谁料得到一个年轻人会有这样的本领呢？他对自己取得的胜利甚至显得满不在乎，正朝一个在此小住的宾客微笑。那人沿着草坪走过来喝茶。她用对待与自己地位相等者的口吻说：“你好歹让他牢牢记住美国吧，他需要的是现实。去年我就注意到了这一点。” 当他们双双骑马穿越林中空地的时候，莫瑞斯尽量让他对美国留下印象。 “我觉得你变得俗气了。”克莱夫批评他说，“跟他们一样，他们对乔伊是不屑一顾的。”克莱夫对自己的家族是完完全全抗拒的。他们把名利心与丝毫不谙世事融为一体，他恨透了这一点。“孩子们也够麻烦的。”当马放慢了速度的时候，他说。 “什么孩子？” “我的呀！彭杰这份家当，需要一个继承人。我母亲把这叫做婚姻，她脑子里转的全是这个念头。” 莫瑞斯沉默了。他从来没有想过自己或是这个朋友会留下后代。 “我会有无休止的烦恼。就像这样，总是有个什么姑娘在家里小住。” “逐渐变老而已……” “你说什么，老弟？” “没什么。”莫瑞斯说罢，勒紧缰绳停住了。他的心中充满了极度的悲伤。他原以为自己不会再有这样的激情了。他和他心爱的人将会消失殆尽。他们的灵魂不会升天，也不会在世上留下子孙。他们胜利地摈弃了习俗，但是大自然依然面对着他们，用冷酷无情的噪音说：“很好，你们就是这样的；我不责备自己的任何孩子。不过，你们得沿着所有不育者的路走下去。”当这个年轻人想到自己竟没有后代时，猛然地羞愧难当。他的母亲或德拉姆太太也许不够聪明，感情贫乏，但她们完成了肉眼看得见的工作。她们将生命的火炬传给了自己的儿子，他们却会把火踩灭。 他无意伤害克莱夫的感情，然而他们刚在羊齿丛中躺下来，他就说出了自己的想法。克莱夫并不同意，“为什么提起孩子？”他问。“为什么老是孩子？爱嘛，在哪儿开始就在哪儿结束，那要美得多，大自然也明白这一点。” “对，但是如果人人都……” 克莱夫把他拖回到他们自己的事情上来。他叽叽咕咕地说什么永恒寓于一小时之内。莫瑞斯没有听懂，克莱夫的嗓音却使他得到抚慰。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/313/444.html","bookId":162,"book":{"id":162,"title":"莫瑞斯 Maurice","description":"简介： 一部探讨社会价值与爱情冲突的经典文学作品。 这是一部描写同性恋情的小说，莫瑞斯和克莱夫是剑桥大学的同学，他们背负社会歧视的压力相爱三年，克莱夫突然提出中止这段感情，遂与安妮结婚。这一变故使莫瑞斯几乎精神崩溃，走上自杀的道路。他寻求心理医生的治疗，谴责...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110526/1-110526162KV57.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/313","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:13 AM"}}
