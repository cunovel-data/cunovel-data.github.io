{"id":28086,"no":78,"title":"THE JEWISH GIRL","content":"AMONG the other children in a charity school sat a little Jewish girl．She was a good，intelligent child，the quickest in all the school；but she had to be excluded from one lesson，for she was not allowed to take part in the Scripture lesson，for it was a Christian school．\n In that hour the girl was allowed to open the geography book，or to do her sum for the next day；but that was soon done；and when she had mastered her lesson in geography，the book indeed remained oped before her，but the little one read no more in it：she sat and listened，and the teacher soon became aware that she was listening more intently than almost any of the other children．\n “Read your book，”the teacher said，in mild re-proof；but her dark beaming eye remained fixed upon him；and once when he addressed a question to her，she knew how to answer better than any of the others could have done．She had heard，understood，and remembered．\n When her father，a poor honest man，first brought the girl to the school，he had stipulated that she should be excluded from the lessons on the Christian faith．But it would have caused disturbance，and perhaps might have awakened discontent in the minds of the others，if she had been sent from the room during the hours in question，and consequently she stayed；but this could not go on any longer．\n The teacher betook himself to her father， and exhorted him either to remove his daughter from the school，or to consent that Sara should become a Christian．\n “I can no longer bear to see these gleaming eyes of the child，and her deep and earnest longing for the words of the Gospel”，said the teacher．\n Then the father burst into tears．\n “I know but little of our own religion，”he said；“but her mother was a daughter of Israel，firm and steadfast in the faith，and I vowed to her as she lay dying that our child should never be baptized．I must keep my vow，for it is even as a covenant with God Himself．”\n And accordingly the little Jewish maiden quitted the Christian school．\n Years have rolled on．\n In one of the smallest provincial towns there dwelt，as a servant in a humble household，a maiden who held the Mosaic faith．Her hair was black as ebony，her eye so dark，and yet full of splendour and light，as is usual with the daughters of the East．It was Sara．The expression in the countenance of the now grown-up maiden was still that of the child sitting upon the schoolroom bench and listening with thoughtful eyes．\n Every Sunday there pealed from the church the sounds of the organ and the song of the congregation．The strains penetrated into the house where the Jewish girl，industrious and faithful in all things，stood at her work．\n “The shalt keep holy the Sabbath-day，”said a voice within her，the voice of the Law；but her Sabbath-day was a working day among the Christians，and she could keep it holy only in her heart，which she did not think was sufficient．But then the thought arose in her soul：“Doth God reckon by days and hours？”And on the Sundny of the Christians the hour of prayer remained undisturbed；and when the sound of the organ and the songs of the congregation sounded across to her as she stood in the kitchen at her work，then even that place seemed to become a sacred one to her．Then she would read in the Old Testament，the treasure and possession of her people，and it was only in this one she could read；for she kept faithfully in the depths of her heart the words her father had said to herself and the teacher when she was taken away from the school，and the promise given to her dying mother，that she should never receive Christian baptism，or desert the faith of her ancestors．The New Testament was to be a sealed book to her；and yet she knew much of it，and the Gospel echoed faintly among the recollections of her youth．\n One evening she was sitting in a corner of the living-room．Her master was reading aloud；and she might listen to him，for it was not the Gospel that he read，but an old story-book，therefore she might stay．The book told of a Hungarian knight who was taken prisoner by a Turkish pasha，who caused him to be yoked with his oxen to the plough，and driven with blows of the whip till he almost sank under the pain and ignominy he endured．The wife of the knight at home parted with all her jewels，and pledged castle and land．The knight\u0027s friends contributed large sums，for the ransom demanded was almost unattainably high；but it was collected at last，and the knight was freed from servitude and misery．Sick and exhausted，he reached his home．But soon another summons came to war against the foes of Christianity：the sick knight heard the call，and had neither peace nor rest．He caused himself to be lifted on his war-horse；and the blood came back to his cheek，his strength appeared to return，and he went forth to battle and to victory．The very same pasha who had yoked him to the plough became his prisoner，and was dragged to his castle．But not an hour had passed when the knight stood before the captive pasha，and said to him，\n “What dost thou suppose awaiteth the？”\n “I know it，”replied the Turk．“Retribution．”\n “Yes，the retribution of the Christian！”resumed the knight．“The doctrine of Christ commands us to forgive our enemies，and to love our fellow man，for God is love．Depart in peace to they home and to they dear ones；but in future be mild and merciful to all who are unfortunate．”\n Then the prisoner broke out into tears，and ex-claimed，\n “How could I believe in the possibility of such mercy？Misery and torment seemed to me inevitable；therefore I took poison，which in a few hours will kill me．I must die—there is no remedy！But before I die，do thou ex-pound to me the teaching which includes so great a measure of love and mercy，for it is great and godlike！Grant me to hear this teaching，and to die a Christian！”And his prayer was fulfilled．\n That was the legend，the story that was read．It was heard and followed by them all；but Sara，the Jewish girl，sitting alone in her corner，listened with a burning heart；great tears came into her gleaming black eyes，and she sat there with a gentle and lowly spirit as she had once sat on the school bench，and felt the grandeur of the Gospel；and the tears rolled down over her cheeks．\n But again the dying words of her mother rose up with-in her：\n “Let not my daughter become a Christian，”the voice cried；and together with it arose the words of the Law：“The shalt honour they father and they mother．”\n “I am not baptized，”she said；“they call me a Jewish girl—our neighbour\u0027s boys hooted me last Sunday，when I stood at the open church door，and looked in at the flaming candles on the altar，and listened to the song of the congregation．Ever since I sat upon the school bench I have felt the force of Christianity，a force like that of a sun-beam，which streams into my soul，however firmly I may shut my eyes against it．But I will not pain the in they grave，O my mother，I will not be unfaithful to the oath of my father，I will not read the Bible of the Christians．I have the God of my fathers to lean upon！”\n And years rolled on again．\n The master died．His widow fell into poverty；and the servant girl was to be dismissed．But Sara refused to leave the house：she became the staff in time of trouble，and kept the household together，working till late in the night to earn the daily bread through the labour of her hands；for no relative came forward to assist the family，and the widow became weaker every day，and lay for months together on a bed of sickness．Sara worked hard，and in the intervals sat kindly ministering by the sick-bed：she was gentle and pious，an angel of blessing In the poverty-stricken house．\n “Yonder on the table lies the Bible，”said the sick woman to Sara．“Read me something from it this long evening：my soul thirsts for the word of the Lord．”\n And Sara bowed her head．\n Her hands folded over the Bible themselves，which she opened and read to the sick woman．Tears stood in her eyes，which gleamed and shone with ecstasy and light shone in her heart．\n “O my mother，”she whispered to herself；“they child may not receive the baptism of the Christians，or be admitted into the congregation—thou hast willed it so，and I shall respect they command：we will remain in union together here on earth；but beyond this earth there is a higher union，even union in God！He will be at our side，and lead us through the valley of death．It is He that descendeth upon the earth when it is athirst，and covers it with fruitfulness．I understand it—I know not how I came to learn the truth；but it is through Him，through Christ！”\n And she started as she pronounced the sacred name，and there came upon her a baptism as of flames of fire，and her frame shook，and her limbs tottered so that she sank down fainting，weaker even than the sick woman by whose couch she had watched．\n “Poor Sara！”said the people；“she is overcome with night watching and toil！”\n They carried her out into the hospital tor the sick poor．There she died；and from thence they carried her to the grave，but not to the churchyard of the Christians，for yonder was no room for the Jewish girl；outside，by the wall，her grave was dug．\n But God\u0027s sun，that shines upon the graves of the Christians，throws its beams also upon the grave of the Jewish girl beyond the wall；and when the psalms are sung in the churchyard of the Christians，they echo like-wise over her lonely resting-place；and she who sleeps beneath is included in the call to the resurrection in the name of Him who spaks to His disciples：\n “John baptized you with water，but I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost！”\n 犹太女子\n \n 在一个慈善学校的许多孩子中间，有一个小小的犹太女孩子。她又聪明，又善良，可以说是他们之中最聪明的一个孩子。但是有一种课程她不能听，那就是宗教这一课。是的，她是在一个基督教的学校里念书。\n 她可以利用上这一课的时间去温习地理，或者准备第二天的算术。但是这些功课一下子就做完了。掌握了地理课的内容之后，尽管书摊在她面前，可是她并没有读。她在坐着静听。老师马上就注意到，她比任何其他的孩子都听得专心。\n “读你自己的书吧，”老师用温和的口气责备她说。她的一对黑得发亮的眼睛望着他。当他向她提问题的时候，她能回答得比所有的孩子都好。她把课全听了，领会了，而且记住了。\n 她的父亲是一个穷苦而正直的人，他曾经向学校请求不要把基督教的课程教给这孩子听。不过假如教这一门功课的时候就叫她走开，那么学校里的别的孩子可能会起反感；甚至引起他们胡思乱想。因此她就留在教室里，但是老这样下去是不对头的。\n 老师去拜访她的父亲，请求他把女儿接回家去，或者干脆让萨拉做一个基督徒。\n “她的那对明亮的眼睛、她的灵魂所表示的对教义深深的、真诚的渴望实在叫我不忍看下去！”老师说。\n 父亲不禁哭起来，说：\n “我对于我们自己的宗教也懂得太少，不过她的妈妈是一个犹太人的女儿，而且信教很深。当她躺在床上要断气的时候，我答应过她，说我决不会让我们的孩子受基督教的洗礼。我必须保持我的诺言，因为这等于是跟上帝订下的一个默契。”\n 这样，犹太女孩子就离开了这个基督教的学校。\n 许多年过去了。\n 在[尤兰的]一个最小的市镇里有一个寒微的人家，里面住着一个信仰犹太教的穷苦女佣人。她就是萨拉。她的头发像乌木一样发黑；她的眼睛深暗，但是像所有的东方女子一样，它们射出明朗的光辉。她现在虽然是一个成年的女佣人，但是她脸上仍然留下儿时的表情——单独坐在学校的凳子上、睁着一对大眼睛听课时的那种孩子的表情。\n 每个礼拜天教堂的风琴奏出音乐，做礼拜的人唱出歌声。这些声音飘到街上，飘到对面的一个屋子里去。这个犹太女子就在这屋子里勤劳地、忠诚地做着工作。\n “记住这个安息日，把它当作一个神圣的日子！”她心里的一个声音这样说，这是法律的声音。\n 但是对她说来，安息日却是一个为基督徒劳做的日子。她只有在心里把这个日子当做神圣的日子，不过她觉得这还不太够。\n “不过日子和时刻，在上帝的眼中看来，有什么了不起的分别呢？”这个思想是在她的灵魂中产生的。\n 在这个基督徒的礼拜天，她也有她安静的祈祷的时刻。只要风琴声和圣诗班的歌声能飘到厨房污水沟的后边来，那么这块地方也可以说是神圣的地方了。于是她就开始读她族人的唯一宝物和财产——《圣经·旧约全书》。她只能读这部书，因为她心中深深地记得她的父亲所说的话——父亲把她领回家时，曾对她和老师讲过：当她的母亲正在断气的时候，他曾经答应过她，不让萨拉放弃祖先的信仰而成为一个基督徒。\n 对于她说来，《圣经·新约全书》是一部禁书，[而且也应该是一部禁书。]但是她很熟悉这部书，因为福音有从童年时的记忆中隐约地回响起来。\n 有一天晚上，她坐在起居室的一个角落里，听她的主人高声地读书。她听一听当然也没有关系，因为这并不是《福音书》——不是的，他是在读一本旧的故事书，因此她可以旁听。书中描写一个匈牙利的骑士，被一个土耳其的高级军官俘获去了。这个军官把他同牛一起套在轭下犁田，而且用鞭子赶着他工作。他所受到的侮辱和痛苦是无法形容的。\n 这位骑士的妻子把她所有的金银首饰都卖光了，把城堡和田产也都典当出去了。他的许多朋友也捐募了大批金钱，因为那个军官所要求的赎金是出乎意外地高。不过这笔数目终于凑集齐了。他算是从奴役和羞辱中获得了解放。他回到家来时已经是病得支持不住了。\n 不过没有多久，另外一道命令又下来了，征集大家去跟基督教的敌人作战。病人一听到这道命令，就无法休息，也安静不下来。他叫人把他扶到战马上。血集中到他的脸上来，他又觉得有气力了。他向战场和胜利驰去。那位把他套在轭下、侮辱他、使他痛苦的将军，现在成了他的俘虏。这个俘虏现在被带到他的城堡里来，还不到一个钟头，那位骑士就出现了。他问这俘虏说：\n “你想你会得到什么待遇呢？”\n “我知道！”土耳其人说。“报复！”\n “一点也不错，你会得到一个基督徒的报复！”骑士说。“基督的教义告诉我们宽恕我们的敌人，爱我们的同胞。上帝本身就是爱！平安地回到你的家里，回到你的亲爱的人中间去吧。不过请你将来对受难的人放温和一些，放仁慈一些吧！”\n 这个俘虏忽然哭起来：“我怎能相信会得到这样的宽恕呢？我想我一定会受到酷刑和痛苦。因此我已经服了毒，过几个钟头毒性就要发作。我非死不可，一点办法也没有！不过在我死以前，请把这种充满了爱和慈悲的教义讲给我听一次，它是这么伟大和神圣！让我怀着这个信仰死去吧！让我作为一个基督徒死去吧！”\n 他的这个要求得到了满足。\n 刚才所读的是一个传说，一个故事。大家都听到了，也懂得了。不过犹太女子萨拉独自一人坐在角落里，听得心中热血沸腾。大颗的泪珠在她乌黑的眼睛里发出亮光。她怀着柔和谦卑的心情坐在那儿，正如她从前坐在教室的凳子上一样。她感到了福音的伟大。眼泪滚到她的脸上来。\n 但是她母亲临终时的话语又一次在她耳边响起：\n “不要让我的孩子成为一个基督徒！”她母亲的声音说；同时律法的声音也响起来：“你必须尊敬你的父母！ ”\n “我不受洗礼！大家把我叫做犹太女子。上个礼拜天邻家的一些孩子就这样讥笑过我。那天我正站在开着的教堂门口，望着里面祭坛上点着的蜡烛和唱着圣诗的会众。自从我在学校的时候起，一直到现在，都觉得基督教有一种力量。这种力量好像太阳光，不管我怎样闭起眼睛，它总能射进我的灵魂中去。但是妈妈，我决不使你在地下感到痛苦！我决不违背爸爸对你所作的诺言！我决不读基督徒的《圣经》。我有我祖先的上帝作为倚靠！”\n 许多年又过去了。\n 主人死去了，女主人家道中落。她不得不解雇女佣人，但是萨拉却不离开。她成了困难中的一个助手，她维持这整个的家庭。她一直工作到深夜，用她双手的劳作来赚取面包。没有任何亲戚来照顾这个家庭，女主人的身体变得一天比一天坏——她在病床上已经躺了好几个月了。温柔而虔诚的萨拉照料家事，看护病人，操劳着。她成了这个贫寒的家里的一个福星。\n “《圣经》就在那边的桌子上！”病人说。“夜很长，请念几段给我听听吧。我非常想听听上帝的话。”\n 于是萨拉低下头。\n 她打开《圣经》，用双手捧着，开始对病人念。她的眼泪涌出来了，眼睛闪着狂喜的光芒，心中也一片光明。\n 她对自己低声说：“妈妈，你的孩子不会接受基督教的洗礼，不会参加基督徒的集会。这是你的嘱咐，我决不会违抗你的意志。我们在这个世界上是一条心，但是在这个世界以外——在上帝面前更是一条心。他将与我们同在，指引我们走出死亡之谷当土地变得干燥时，他就降到地上来，使它变得丰饶！我现在懂得了，我自己也不知道我是怎样懂得的！这是通过他——通过基督我才认识到了真理！”\n 她一念出这个神圣的名字的时候，就颤抖一下。一股洗礼的火焰透过了她的全身，她的身体支持不住，昏倒了，比她所看护的那个病人还要衰弱。\n “可怜的萨拉！”大家说，“她日夜看护和劳动已经把身体累坏了。”\n 人们把她抬到慈善医院去。她在那里死了。于是人们就把她埋葬了，但是没有埋葬在基督徒的墓地里，因为那里面没有犹太人的地方。不，她的坟墓是掘在墓地的墙外。\n 但是上帝的太阳照在基督徒的墓地上，也照在墙外犹太女子的坟上。基督教徒墓地里的赞美歌声，也在她那孤独的坟墓上空盘旋。同样，在以救主基督的名义召唤亡灵复活的时候，长眠地下的她也在被召之列，对他的门徒说：\n ‘约翰用水来使你受洗礼，我用圣灵来使你受洗礼！’”\n 这篇故事于1856年发表在《丹麦大众历书》上。它来源于匈牙利的一个古老的民间传说，但安徒生给它赋予了新的主题思想。犹太教和基督教是彼此排斥、势不两立的，但在安徒生的心中最大的宗教是“爱”。一切教派在它面前都会黯然失色——当然他的“爱”是通过基督来体现的。这也是安徒生的“上帝”观，事实上是他的“和平主义”和“人类一家”的思想的具体说明。\n \n
