{"id":28082,"no":74,"title":"THE MONEY-PIG","content":"IN the nursery a unmber of toys lay strewn about：high up，on the wardrobe，stood the Money-box，it was of clay in the shape of a little pig；of course the pig had a slit in its back，and this slit had been so enlarged with a knife that whole dollar-pieces could slip through；and，indeed，two such had slipped into the box，besides a number of pence．The Money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle，and that is the highest point a Money-pig can attain．There it stood upon the cupboard，high and lofty，looking down upon everything else in the room．It knew very well that what it had in its stomach would have bought all the toys，and that\u0027s what we call having self-respect．\n The others thought of that too，even if they did not exactly express it，for there were many other things to speak of．One of the drawers was half pulled out， and there lay a great handsome Doll，though she was somewhat old，and her neck had been mended．She looked out and said，\n “Shall we now play at men and women，for that is al-ways something？”\n And now there was a general uproar，and even the framed prints on the walls turned round and showed that there was a wrong side to them；but they did not do it to protest against the proposal．\n It was late at night；the moon shone through the window-frames and gave free light．Now the game was about to begin，and all，even the children\u0027s Go-Cart，Which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings，were invited to take part in the sport．\n “Each one has his own peculiar value，”said the Go-Cart：“we cannot all be noblemen．There must be some who do the work，as the saying is．”\n The Money-pig was the only one who received a writ-ten invitation，for he was of high standing，and they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message．\n Indeed，he did not answer to say whether he would come，nor did he come：if he was to take a part，he must enjoy the sport from his own home；they were to arrange accordingly，and，so they did．\n The little toy theatre was now put up in such a way that the Money-pig could look directly in．They wanted to begin with a comedy，and afterwards there was to be a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement，and with this latter part they began immediately．The Rocking-Horse spoke of training and race，the Go-Cart of railways and steam power，for all this belonged to their profession，and it was something they could talk about．The Clock talked politics-ticks-ticks-and knew what was the time of day，though it was whispered he did not go correctly；the Bamboo Cane stood there，stiff and proud，for he was conceited about his brass ferrule and his silver top，for being thus bound above and below；and on the sofa lay two worked Cushions，pretty and stupid．And now the play began．\n All sat and looked on，and it was requested that the audience should applaud and crack and stamp according as they were gratified．But the Riding-Whip said he never cracked for old people，only for young ones who were not yet married．\n “I crack for everything，”said the Cracker．\n And these were the thoughts they had while the play went on．The piece was worthless，but it was well played；all the characters turned their painted side to the audience，for they were so made that they should only be looked at from that side，and not from the other；and all played wonderfully well，coming out quite beyond the lamps，because the wires were a little too long，but that only made them come out the more．The mended Doll was so affected that she burst at the mended place in her neck，and the Money-pig was so enchanted in his way that he formed the resolution to do something for one of the players，and to remember him in his will as the one who should be buried with him in the family vault when matters were so far advanced．\n It was true enjoyment，so that they quite gave up the thoughts of tea，and only carried out the idea of mental recreation．That\u0027s what they called playing at men and women；and there was no malice in it，for they were only playing；and each one thought of himself and of what the Money-pig might think；and the Money-pig thought farthest of all，for he thought of making his will and of his burial．And when might this come to pass？Certainly far sooner than was expected．Crack！it fell down from the cup-board-fell on the ground，and was broken to pieces；and the pennies hopped and danced：the little ones turned round like tops，and the bigger ones rolled away，particularly the one great Silver Dollar who wanted to go out into the world．And he came out into the world，and they all succeeded in doing so．The pieces of the Money-pig were put into the dust-bin；but the next day a new Money-pig was standing on the cupboard：it had not yet a farthing in its stomach，and therefore could not rattle，and in this it was like the other．But that was a beginning-and with that we will make an end．\n 钱猪\n \n 婴儿室里有许多许多玩具；橱柜顶上有一个扑满，它的形状像猪，是泥烧的，它的背上自然还有一条狭口。这狭口后来又用刀子挖大了一点，好使整个银元也可以塞进去。的确，除了许多银毫以外，里面也有两块银元。\n 钱猪装得非常满，连摇也摇不响——这的确要算是一只钱猪所能达到的最高峰了。他现在高高地站在橱柜上，瞧不起房里一切其他的东西。他知道得很清楚，他肚皮里所装的钱可以买到这所有的玩具。这就是我们所谓的“心中有数”。\n 别的玩具也想到了这一点，虽然它们不讲出来——因为还有许多其他的事情要讲。桌子的抽屉是半开着的；这里面有一个很大的漂亮玩具娃娃。她略微有点儿旧，脖子也修理过一次。她朝外边望了一眼，说：\n “我们现在来扮演人好吗？因为这究竟是值得一做的事情呀！”\n 这时大家骚动了一下，甚至墙上挂着的那些画也掉过身来，表示它们也有反对的一面；不过这并不是说明它们在抗议。\n 现在是半夜了。月亮从窗子外面照进来，送来不花钱的光。游戏就要开始了。所有的玩具，甚至属于比较粗糙的玩具一类的学步车，都被邀请了。\n “每个人都有自己的优点，”学步车说。“我们不能全都是贵族。正如俗话所说的，总要有人做事才成！”\n 只有钱猪接到了一张手写的请帖，因为他的地位很高，大家都担心他不会接受口头的邀请。\n 的确，他并没有回答说他来不来，而事实上他没有来。如果要他参加的话，他得在自己家里欣赏。大家可以照他的意思办，结果他们也就照办了。\n 那个小玩偶舞台布置得恰恰可以使他一眼就能看到台上的表演。大家想先演一出喜剧，然后再吃茶和作知识练习。他们立刻就开始了。摇木马谈到训练和纯血统问题，学步车谈到铁路和蒸汽的力量。这些事情都是他们的本行，所以他们都能谈谈。座钟谈起政治：“滴答——滴答”。它知道它敲的是什么时候，不过，有人说他走得并不准确。竹手杖直挺挺地站着，骄傲得不可一世，因为它上面包了银头，下面箍了铜环，上上下下都包了东西。沙发上躺着两个绣花垫子，很好看，但是糊涂。现在戏可以开始了。\n 大家坐着看戏。事先大家都说好了，观众应该根据自己喜欢的程度喝彩、鼓掌和跺脚。不过马鞭说他从来不为老人鼓掌，他只为还没有结婚的年轻人鼓掌。\n “我对大家都鼓掌，”爆竹说。\n [“一个人应该有一个立场！”痰盂说。]这是当戏正在演的时候他们心中所有的想法。\n 这出戏没有什么价值，但是演得很好。所有的人物都把它们涂了颜色的一面掉向观众，因为他们只能把正面拿出来看，而不能把反面拿出来看。大家都演得非常好，都跑到舞台前面来，因为拉着它们的线很长，不过这样人们就可以把他们看得更清楚。\n 那个补了一次的玩偶是那么受感染，弄得她脖子上的补丁都松开了。钱猪也看得兴奋起来，他决心要为演员中的某一位做点事情，他要在遗嘱上写下，到了适当的时候，他要这位演员跟他一起葬在公墓里。这才是真正的愉快，因此大家就放弃吃菜，继续做知识练习。这就是他们所谓的扮演人类了。这里面并没有什么恶意，因为他们只不过是扮演罢了，每件东西只想着自己和猜想钱猪的心事；而这钱猪想得最远，因为他想到了写遗嘱和入葬的事情。这事会在什么时候发生？当然是始料不及的。\n 啪！他从橱柜上掉下来了——落到地上，跌成了碎片。小银毫跳着，舞着，那些顶小的像陀螺一样打着转，那些大的打着转滚开了，特别是那块大银元——他居然想跑到广大的世界里去。他真的跑到广大的世界里去了，其他的也都是一样。钱猪的碎片则被扫进垃圾箱里去了，不过，在第二天，碗柜上又出现了一个[泥烧的]新钱猪。它肚皮里还没有装进钱，因此它也摇不出响声来；在这一点上说来，它跟别的东西完全没有什么分别。不过这只是一个开始而已——与这开始同时，我们作一个结尾。\n \n 这是一篇很有风趣的小品，最初发表在1855年哥本哈根出版的《丹麦大众历书》上。“钱猪”肚子里装满钱，满得连摇动时连响声都不发，是一种大人物沉着庄重的样子。但它跌碎了以后，钱都光了，另一个新“钱猪”来代替它；“它肚皮里还没有装进钱，因此它也摇不出响声来。”实际既然如此，“它跟别的东西完全没有什么区别，”因此它就谈不上是什么大人物了。世事就是如此。\n \n
