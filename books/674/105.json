{"id":28113,"no":105,"title":"TWELVE BY THE MAIL","content":"IT was bitterly cold；the sky gleamed with stars，and not a breeze was stirring．\\n\\n Bump！An old pot was thrown at the neighbors’house doors．Bang！Bang！went the gun；for they were welcoming the New Year．It was New Year\u0027s Eve！The church clock was striking twelve！\\n\\n Tan-ta-ra-ra！ The mail came in．The great carriage stopped at the gate of the town．There were twelve persons in it；all the places were taken．\\n\\n “Hurrah！Hurrah！”sang the people in the houses of the town，for the New Year was being welcomed，and they had just risen with the filled glass in the their hand，to drink success to the new year．\\n\\n “Happy New Year！”was the cry．“A pretty wife，plenty of money，and no sorrow or care！”\\n\\n This wish was passed round，and then glasses were clashed together till they rang again，and in front of the town gate the post-carriage stopped with the strange guests，the twelve travelers．\\n\\n And who were these strangers？Each of them had his passport and his luggage with him；they even brought presents for me and for you and for all the people of the little town．Who are they？What did they want？ and what did they bring with them？\\n\\n “Good morning！”they cried to the sentry at the town gate．\\n\\n “Good morning！” replied the sentry，for the clock struck twelve．\\n\\n “Your name and profession？”the sentry inquired of the one who alighted first from the carriage．\\n\\n “See yourself，in the passport，”replied the man．“I am myself！”And a capital fellow he looked，arrayed in a bear-skin and fur boots．“I am the man on whom many persons fix their hopes．Come to me tomorrow，and I\u0027ll give you a New Year s present．I throw pence and dollars among the people，I even give balls，thirty-one balls；but I cannot devote more than thirty-one nights to this．My ships are frozen in，but in my office it is warm and comfortable．I\u0027m a merchant．My name is JANUARY，and I only Carry accounts with me．”\\n\\n Now the second alighted．He was a merry companion；he was a theater director，manager of the masque balls，and all the amusements one can imagine．His luggage consisted of a great tub．\\n\\n “We\u0027ll knock more than the cat out of the tub at the Shrovetide sports，” said he．“I\u0027ll prepare a merry tune for you and myself too．I have the shortest lifetime of whole family，for I only become twenty-eight．Sometimes they pop me in an extra day，but I trouble myself very little about that．Hurrah！”\\n\\n “You must not shout so！”said the sentry．\\n\\n “Certainly，I may shout！”retorted the man．“I\u0027m Prince Carnival，traveling under the name of FEBRU-ARY！”\\n\\n The third now got out．He looked like Fasting itself，but carried his nose very high，for he was related to the “Forty Knights”，and was a weather prophet．But that\u0027s not a profitable office，and that\u0027s why he praised fasting．In his buttonhole he had a little bunch of violets，but they were very small．\\n\\n “MARCH！MARCH！”the fourth called after him，and slapped him on the shoulder．“Into the guardroom；there is punch！I can smell it．”\\n\\n But it was not true；he only wanted to make an APRIL fool of him；for with that the fourth began his career in the town．He looked very jovial，did little work，but had the more holidays．\\n\\n “Up and down it goes with one \u0027s humor！”said he；“now rain，now sunshine．I can a kind of house and office-letting agent，also a manager of funerals．I can both laugh and cry，according to circumstances．Here in this box I have my summer wardrobe，but it would be very foolish to put it on．Here I am now！On Sundays I go out walking in shoes and silk stockings，and with a muff！”\\n\\n After him，a lady came out of the carriage．She called herself Miss MAY．She wore a summer costume and overshoes，a light green dress，and anemones in her hair，and she was so scented with wood ruff that the sentry had to sneeze．\\n\\n “God bless you！”she said，and that was her salutation．\\n\\n How pretty she was！And she was a singer，not a theater singer，but a singer of the woods，for she roamed through the gay green forest，and sang there for her own amusement．\\n\\n “Now comes the young dame！”said those in the carriage．\\n\\n And the young dame stepped out，delicate，proud，and pretty．It was easy to see that she was Mistress JUNE，accustomed to be served by drowsy marmots．She gave a great feast on the longest day of the year，that the guests might have time to partake of the many dishes at her table．She，indeed，kept her own carriage；but still she traveled in the mail with the rest，because she wanted to show that she was not high-minded．But she was not without protection；her elder brother JULY was with her．\\n\\n He was a plump young fellow，clad in summer garments，and with a Panama hat．He had but little baggage with him，because it was cumbersome in the great heat；therefore he had only swimming-drawers，and those are not much．\\n\\n Then came the mother herself，Madam AUGUST，wholesale dealer in fruit，proprieties of a large number of fishponds，and land cultivator，in a great crinoline；she was fat and hot，could use her hands well，and would herself carry out beer to the workmen in the fields．\\n\\n “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread，”said she：“that is written in the Book．Afterwards one can have dancing in the green wood，and the harvest feasts！”\\n\\n She was a thorough housewife．\\n\\n After her， a man came out of the coach，a painter，Mr．Master-colourer．The forest had to receive him；the leaves were to change their colours，but how beautifully！When he wished it；soon the wood gleamed with red，yel-low，and brown．The master whistled like the black mag-pie，was a quick workman，and wound the brown green hop plants round his beer-jug．That was an ornament for the jug，and he had a good idea of ornament．There he stood with his colour pot，and that was his whole luggage．\\n\\n A landed proprietor followed him，one who cared for the ploughing and preparing of the land，and also for field sports．He brought his dog and his Run with him，and had nuts in his game-bag．“Crack！Crack！”He had much baggage，even an English plough；and he spoke of farming，but one could scarcely hear what he said，for the coughing and gasping of his neighbor．\\n\\n It was NOVEMBER who came．He was very much plagued by a cold，a violent cold，so that he used a sheet and not a pocket-handkerchief，and yet，he said，he was obliged to accompany the servant girls to their new winter places．He said he should get rid of his cold when he went out wood-cutting，and had to saw and split wood，for he was master-sawyer to the firewood guild．He spent his evenings cutting the wooden soles for skates，for he knew，he said，that in a few weeks there would be occasion to use these amusing shoes．\\n\\n At length appeared the last passenger，the old Mother with her fire-stool．The old lady was cold，but her eyes glistened like two bright stars．She carried a flower-pot with a little fir tree．\\n\\n “This tree I will guard and cherish，that it may grow large by Christmas Eve，and may reach from the ground to the ceiling，and may rear itself upward with flaming candles，golden apples，and little carved figures．The fire-stool warms like a stove．I bring the story-book out of my pocket and read aloud，so that all the children in the room become quite quiet；but the little figures on the trees be-come lively，and the little waxen angel on the top spreads out his wings of gold leaf，flies down from his green perch，and kisses great and small in the room，yes，even the poor children who stand outside，singing the carol about the Star of Bethlehem．”\\n\\n “Well，now the coach may drive away！”said the sentry：“we have the whole twelve．Let a new chaise drive up．”\\n\\n “First let all the twelve come in to me，”said the captain on duty，“one after the other．The passports I will keep here．Each of them is available for a month；when that has passed，I shall write their behavior on each pass-port．Mr．January，have the goodness to come here．”\\n\\n And Mr．January stepped forward．\\n\\n When a year is passed I think I shall be able to tell you what the twelve have brought to me，and to you，and to all of us．Now I do not know it，and they don\u0027t know it themselves，probably，for we live in strange times．\\n\\n 乘邮车来的十二位旅客\\n\\n \\n\\n 严寒，满天星斗，万籁无声。\\n\\n 砰！有人把一个旧罐子扔到邻家的门上。啪！啪！这是欢迎新年到来的枪声。这是除夕。钟正敲了12下。\\n\\n 得——达——拉——拉！邮车到来了。这辆大邮车在城门口停了下来。它里面坐着12个人，再也没有空地方了，所有的位子都占了。\\n\\n “恭喜！恭喜！”屋子里的人说，因为大家正在祝贺新年。这时大家刚刚举起满杯的酒，打算为庆祝新年而干杯。\\n\\n “祝你新年幸福和健康！”大家说。“祝你娶一个漂亮太太，赚很多的钱，什么伤心事儿和麻烦事儿都没有！”\\n\\n 是的，这就是大家的希望。大家互相碰着杯子。城门外停着邮车，里面坐着陌生的客人——12位旅客。\\n\\n 这些人是谁呢？他们都带有护照和行李。的确，他们还带来送给你、送给我和送给镇上所有的人的礼物。这些陌生的客人是谁呢？他们来做什么呢？他们带来了什么呢？\\n\\n “早安！”他们对城门口的哨兵说。\\n\\n “早安！”哨兵回答说，因为钟已经敲了12下。\\n\\n “你叫什么名字？你干什么职业？”哨兵问第一个下车的人。\\n\\n “请看护照上的字吧！”这人说。“我就是我！”他穿着熊皮大衣和皮靴子，样子倒很像一个了不起的人物。“许多人把希望寄托在我身上。明天来看我吧，我将送给你一个真正的新年礼物。我把银毫子和银元扔给大家，我甚至还开舞会——整整31个舞会。比这再多的夜晚我可腾不出来了。我的船已经被冰冻住了，不过我的办公室里还是温暖又舒适。我是一个生意人；我的名字叫‘一月’。我身边只携带着单据。”\\n\\n 接着第二个人下车了。他是一位快乐朋友，一个剧团的老板，化装跳舞会以及你所能想象得到的一切娱乐的主持人。他的行李是一个大桶。\\n\\n “在狂欢节的时候，我可以从里面变出比猫儿还要好的东西来，”他说。“我叫别人愉快，也叫自己愉快。在我的一家人中我的寿命最短。我只有28天！有时人们给我多加一天，不过这也没有什么了不起。乌啦！”\\n\\n “请你不要大声喊，”哨兵说。\\n\\n “我当然可以喊，”这人说。“我是狂欢节的王子，在‘二月’这个名义下到各地去旅行的。”\\n\\n 现在第三个人下车了。他简直是一个斋神的缩影。他趾高气扬，因为他跟“40位骑士”有亲戚关系，他同时还是一个天气的预言家。不过这并不是一个肥差事，因此他非常赞成吃斋。他的扣子洞上插着一束紫罗兰，但是花朵儿都很小。\\n\\n “‘三月’，走呀！”第四个人在后面喊着，把他推了一下。“[走呀！走呀！]走到哨房里去呀。那里有混合酒吃！我已经闻到香味了！”\\n\\n 不过这不是事实，他只是愚弄他一下罢了，因为这第四位旅客就是以愚弄人开始他的活动的。他的样子倒是蛮高兴的，不大做事情，老是放假。\\n\\n “我随人的心情而变化，”他说，“今天下雨，明天出太阳。我替人干搬出搬进的工作。\\n\\n 我是搬家代理人，也是一个做殡仪馆生意的人。我能哭，也能笑。我的箱子里装着许多夏天的衣服，不过现在把它们穿起也未免太傻了。我就是这个样子。我要打扮的时候，就穿起丝袜子，戴上皮手筒。”\\n\\n 这时有一位小姐从车里走出来。“我是‘五月小姐’！”她说。她穿着一身夏季衣服和一双套鞋。她的长袍是淡绿色的，头上戴着秋牡丹，身上发出麝香草的香气，弄得哨兵也不得不嗅一下。\\n\\n “愿上帝祝福你！”她说——这就是她的敬礼。\\n\\n 她真是漂亮！她是一个歌唱家，但不是舞台上，而是山林里的歌唱家。[她也不是市场上的歌唱家。不，]她只在清新的绿树林里为自己的高兴而歌唱。[她的皮包里装着克里斯仙·温得尔的《木刻》——这简直像山毛榉树林；此外还装得有“李加尔特的小诗”——这简直像麝香草。]“现在来了一位太太——一位年轻的太太！”坐在车里的人说。于是一位太太便走出来了；她是年轻而纤细、骄矜而美丽的。\\n\\n 人们一看就知道，她是“六月太太”，她生下来就是为了保护那“七个睡觉的人” 的。\\n\\n 她选一年中最长的一天来开一个盛大的宴会，好使人们有足够的时间把许多不同的菜吃掉。\\n\\n 她自己有一辆“包车”，但是她仍然跟大家一起坐在邮车里，因为她想借此表示她并非骄傲得瞧不起人。她可不是单独地在旅行，因为她的弟弟“七月”跟她在一道。\\n\\n 他是一个胖胖的年轻人，穿着一身夏天的衣服，戴着一顶巴拿马帽。他的行李带得不多，因为行李这东西在炎热的天气里是一种累赘。\\n\\n 他只带着游泳帽和游泳裤——这不能算很多。\\n\\n 现在妈妈“八月太太”来了。她是一个水果批发商，拥有许多蓄鱼池，兼当地主。她穿着一条鼓鼓的裙子。她很肥胖，但是活泼；她什么事都干，她甚至还亲手送啤酒给田里的工人喝。\\n\\n “你必汗流满面才得糊口。”她说，“因为《圣经》上是这样说的。事做完了以后，你们可以在绿树林中跳舞和举行一次庆祝丰收的宴会！”\\n\\n 她是一个细致周到的主妇。\\n\\n 现在有一个男子走出来了。他是一个画师——一个色彩专家，树林是知道这情况的。叶子全都要改变颜色，而且只要他愿意，可以变得非常美丽。树林很快就染上了红色、黄色和棕色。这位画家吹起口哨来很像一只黑色的燕八哥。他工作的速度非常快。他把紫绿色的啤酒花 的蔓藤缠在啤酒杯上，使它显得非常好看——的确，他有审美的眼光。他现在拿着的颜料罐就是他的全部行李。\\n\\n 他后面接着来的是一个“拥有田产的人”。这人只是关心粮食的收获和土地的耕作；他对于野外打猎也有一点兴趣。他有猎狗和猎枪，他的猎袋里还有许多硬壳果。咕碌——咕碌！他带的东西真多——他甚至还有一架英国犁。他谈着种田的事情，但是人们听不清他的话，因为旁边有一个人在咳嗽和喘气——“十一月”已经来了。\\n\\n 这人得了伤风病——伤风得厉害，因此手帕不够用，他只好用一张床单。虽然如此，他说他还得陪着女佣人做冬天的活计。他说，他一出去砍柴，他的伤风就会好了。他必须去锯木头和劈木头，因为他是木柴公会的第一把锯手。他利用晚上的时间来雕冰鞋的木底，因为他知道，几个星期以后大家需要这种有趣的鞋子。\\n\\n 现在最后的一个客人来了。她是“火钵老妈妈”。她很冷，她的眼睛射出的光辉像两颗明亮的星星。她拿着栽有一株小枞树的花盆。\\n\\n “我要保护和疼爱这棵树，好使它到圣诞节的时候能够长大，能够从地上伸到天花板，点着明亮的蜡烛，挂着金黄苹果和剪纸。火钵像炉子似地发出暖气，我从衣袋里拿出一本童话，高声朗诵，好叫房间里的孩子们都安静下来。\\n\\n 不过树上的玩偶都变得非常活跃。树顶上的一个蜡制的小安琪儿，拍着他的金翅膀，从绿枝上飞下来，把房里大大小小的孩子都吻了一下，甚至把外面的穷孩子也吻了。这些穷孩子正在唱着关于“伯利恒的星”的圣诞颂歌。\\n\\n “现在车子可以开了，”哨兵说。“我们已经弄清楚了这12位旅客。让另一辆马车开出来吧。”\\n\\n “先让这12位进去吧，”值班的大尉说。\\n\\n “一次进去一位！护照留给我。每一本护照的有效期间是一个月。这段时间过去以后，我将在每一本护照上把他们的行为记下来。请吧，‘一月’先生，请你进去”。\\n\\n 于是他走进去了。\\n\\n 等到一年以后，我将告诉你这12位先生带了些什么东西给你，给我，给大家。我现在还不知道，可能他们自己也不知道——因为我们是活在一个奇怪的时代里。\\n\\n \\n\\n 这篇小品发表在1861年3月2日哥本哈根出版的《新的童话和故事集》第2卷里。故事最后的一句话“因 为我们是活在一个奇怪的时代里”，是指时代的进步，人类的创造，日新月异，时时刻刻都在变化，思想停滞在旧时代的人，自然会不习惯，会感到“奇怪”。\\n\\n \\n\\n
