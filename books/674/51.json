{"id":28059,"no":51,"title":"THE FLAX","content":"THE Flax stood in blossom; it had pretty little blue flowers, smooth as a moth\u0027s wings, and even more delicate. The sun shone on the Flax, and the rain clouds moistened it, and this was just as good for it as it is for little children when they are washed, and afterwards get a kiss from their mother; they become much prettier, and so did the Flax. “The people say that I stand uncommonly well,”said the Flax,“and that I\u0027m fine and long, and shall make a capital piece of linen. How happy I am! I\u0027m certainly the happiest of beings. How well off I am! And I may come to something! How the sunshine gladdens, and the rain tastes good and refreshes me! I\u0027m wonderfully happy; I\u0027m the happiest of beings.” “Yes,yes,yes!”said the Hedge-stake.“You don\u0027t know the world, but we do, for we have knots in us;”and then it creaked out mournfully, “Snip-snap-snurre, Basse-lurre! The song is done.” “No, it is not done,”said the Flax.“Tomorrow the sun will shine, or the rain will refresh us. I feel that I\u0027m growing, I feel that I\u0027m in blossom! I\u0027m the happiest of beings.” But one day the people came and took the Flax by the head and pulled it up by the root. That hurt; and it was laid in water as if they were going to drown it, and then put on the fire as if it was going to be roasted. It was quite fearful! “One, can\u0027t always have good times,”said the Flax. One must make one\u0027s experiences, and so one gets to know something. But bad times certainly came. The Flax was bruised and scutched, and broken and hackled. Yes, it did not even know what the operations were called that they did with it. It was put on the spinning-wheel----whirr! whirr!whirr!----it was not possible to collect one\u0027s thoughts. “I have been uncommonly happy!”it thought in all its pain.“One must be content with the good one has enjoyed! Contented! contented! Oh!”And it continued to say so even when it was put into the loom, and till it became a large beautiful piece of linen. All the flax, to the last stalk, was used in making one piece. “But this is quite remarkable! I should never have believed it! How favourable fortune is to me! The Hedgestake was well informed, truly, with its Snip-snap-snurre, Basse-lurre! The song is not done by any means.Now it\u0027s beginning in earnest. That\u0027s quite remarkable! If I\u0027ve suffered something, I\u0027ve been made into something! I\u0027 m the happiest of all! How strong and fine I am, how white and long! That\u0027s something different from being a mere plant, even if one has a flower. One is not attended to, and only gets watered when it rains. Now I\u0027m attended to and cherished;the maid turns me over every morning, and I get a shower bath from the watering-pot every evening. Yes,the clergyman\u0027s wife has even made a speech about me, and says I\u0027m the best piece in the whole parish.I cannot be happier!” Now the Linen was taken into the house, and put under the scissors: how they cut and tore it, and then pricked it with needles! That was not pleasant; but twelve pieces of body linen of a kind not often mentioned by name, but indispensable to all people, were made of it----a whole dozen! “Just look! Now something has really been made of me! So, that was my destiny. That\u0027s a real bles sing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, and that\u0027s right, that\u0027s a true pleasure! We\u0027ve been made into twelve things, but yet we\u0027re all one and the same; we\u0027re just a dozen: how remarkably charming that is!” Years rolled on, and now they would hold together no longer. “It must be over one day,”said each piece.“I would gladly have held together a little longer, but one must not expect impossibilities.” They were now torn into pieces and fragments.They thought it was all over now, for they were hacked to shreds, and softened and boiled; yes, they themselves did not know all that was done to them; and then they became beautiful white paper. Now, that is a surprise, and a glorious surprise!”said the Paper.“Now I\u0027m finer than before, and I shall be written on: that is remarkably good fortune.” And really the most beautiful stories and verses were written upon it, and the people heard what was upon it; it was sensible and good, and made people much more sensible and good: there was a great blessing in the words that were on this Paper. “That is more than I ever imagined when I was a little blue flower in the fields. How could I fancy that I should ever spread joy and knowledge among men? I can\u0027t yet understand it myself, but it is really so. I have done nothing myself but what I was obliged with my weak powers to do for my own preservation,and yet I have been promoted from one joy and honour to another. Each time when Ithink‘the song is done,’it begins again in a higher and better way. Now I shall certainly be sent about to journey through the world, so that all people may read me. That is the only probable thing. I\u0027ve splendid thoughts, as many as I had pretty flowers in the old times. I\u0027m the happiest of beings.” But the Paper was not sent on its travels, it was sent to the printer, and everything that was written upon it was set up in type for a book, or rather for many hundreds of books, for in this way a very far greater number could derive pleasure and profit from the book than if the one paper on which it was written had run about the world, to be worn out before it had got half-way. “Yes,that is certainly the wisest way,”thought the Written Paper.“I really did not think of that. I shall stay at home, and be held in honour, just like an old grandfather. It was on me the writing was done; the words flowed from the pen right into me. I remain here and the books run about. Now something can really be done. I am the happiest of all.” Then the Paper was tied together in a bundle, and put on a shelf. “It\u0027s good resting after work,”said the Paper.“It is very right that one should collect one\u0027s thoughts. Now I\u0027m able for the first time to think of what is in me, and to know oneself is true progress. What will be done with me now? At any rate I shall go forward again:I\u0027m always going forward.” One day all the paper was laid on the hearth in order to be burnt, for it must not be sold to the grocer to wrap up butter and sugar. And all the children in the house stood round; they wanted to see it blaze, they wanted to see among the ashes the many red sparks, which seemed to dart off and go out, one after the other, so quickly. These are the children going out of school, and the last spark of all is the schoolmaster: one often thinks he has gone already, but he always comes a little after all the others. All the old Paper, the whole bundle,was laid upon the fire, and it was soon alight.“Ugh!”it said, and burst out into bright flame that mounted up higher than the Flax had ever been able to lift its little blue flowers,and glittered as the white Linen had never been able to glitter. All the written letters turned for a moment quite red, and all the words and thoughts turned to flame. “Now I\u0027m mounting straight up to the sun,”said a voice in the flame; and it was as if a thousand voices said this in unison; and the flames mounted up through the chimney and out at the top, and more delicate than the flames, invisible to human eyes,little tiny beings floated there, as many as there had been blossoms on the Flax. They were lighter even than the flame from which they were born; and when the flame was extinguished, and nothing remained of the Paper but black ashes, they danced over it once more, and where they touched the black mass the little red sparks appeared. The children came out of school, and the schoolmaster was the last of all. That was fun! and the children sang over the dead ashes---- “Snip-snap-snurre, Basse-lurre! The song is done.” But the little invisible beings all said, “The song is never done, that is the best of all. I know it, and therefore I\u0027m the happiest of all.” But the children could neither hear that nor understand it, nor ought they, for children must not know everything.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881/1038.html","bookId":674,"book":{"id":674,"title":"安徒生童话全集","description":"简介： 汉斯克里斯蒂安安徒生（Hans Christian Andersen，1805年4月2日－1875年8月4日）丹麦作家，诗人，因为他的童话故事而世界闻名。他最著名的童话故事有《小锡兵》、《冰雪女王》、《拇指姑...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201402/25/14-30-17-86-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
