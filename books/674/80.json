{"id":28088,"no":80,"title":"THE STONE OF THE WISE MEN","content":"OF course you know the story of Holger the Dane；we are not going to tell you that，but will ask if you re-member from it that“Holger the Dane won the great land of India，east as far as the world\u0027s end，even to the tree which is called the Tree of the Sun，”as Christian Pedersen puts it．Do you know Christian Pedersen？it doesn\u0027t matter if you don\u0027t．Holger the Dane gave Prester John power and authority over the land of India．Do you know Prester John？it doesn\u0027t matter either if you don\u0027t know him，for he doesn\u0027t come into this story at all．You are to hear about the Tree of the Sun“in India，east as far as the world\u0027s end”，and it was then understood by men who had not learned geography as we have：but that also does not matter at the present time．\n The Tree of the Sun was a noble tree，such as we have never seen and such as you will never see either．The crown stretched out several miles around；it was real-ly an entire wood；each of its smallest branches formed，in its turn，a whole tree．Palms，beech trees，pines，plane trees，and various other kinds grew here，which are found scattered in all other parts of the world：they shot out like small branches from the great boughs，and these large houghs with their windings and knots formed，as it were，valleys and hills，clothed with velvety green and covered with flowers．Every branch was like a wide，blooming meadow，or like the most charming garden．The sun shone down on it with delightful rays，for it was the tree of the sun，and the birds from all quarters of the world assembled together—birds from the primaeval forests of America，the rose gardens of Damascus，from the deserts of Africa，in which the elephant and the lion boast of being the only rulers．The Polar birds came flying hither，and of course the stork and the swallow were not absent；but the birds were not the only living beings：the stag，the squirrel，the antelope，and a hundred other beautiful and light－footed animals were at home．\n The crown of the tree was a widespread fragrant gar-den，and in the midst of it，where the great boughs raised themselves like green hillocks，there stood a castle of crystal，with a view of all the lands of the world．Each tower was reared in the form of a lily．Through the stem one could asced，for within it was a winding stair；one could step out upon the leaves as upon balconies；and up in the calyx of the flower itself was the most beautiful，sparkling round hall，above which no other roof rose but the blue firmament with sun and stars．\n Just as much splendour，though in another way，appeared below，in the wide halls of the castle．Here，on the walls，the whole world around was reflected．One saw everything that was done，so that there was no necessity for reading any papers，and indeed there were no papers there．Everything was to he seen in living pictures，if one only wished to see it；for too much is still too much even for the wisest man；and this man dwelt here．His name is very difficult—you will not be able to pronounce it，and therefore it may remain unmentioned．He knew everything that a man on earth can know or can get to know；every invention which had already been or which was yet to be made was known to him；but nothing more，for everything in the world has its limits．The wise King Solomon was only half as wise as he，and yet he was very wise，and governed the powers of nature，and held sway over potent spirits：yea，Death itself was obliged to give him every morning a list of those who were to die during the day．But King Solomon himself was obliged to die too；and this thought it was which often in the deepest manner employed the inquirer，the mighty lord in the castle on the Tree of the Sun．He also，however high he might tower above men in wisdom，must die one day．He knew that he and his children also must fade away like the leaves of the forest，and become dust．He saw the human race fade away like the leaves on the tree；saw new men come to fill their places；but the leaves that fell off never sprouted forth again—they fell to dust or were transformed into other parts of plants．\n “What happens to man，”the wise man asked him－self，“when the angel of death touches him？What may death be？The body is dissolved．And the soul？Yes，what is the soul？whither doth it go？To eternal life，says the comforting voice of religion；but what is the transition？where does one live and how？Above，in heaven，says the pious man，thither we go．Thither？”repeated the wise man，and fixed his eyes upon the sun and the stars；“up yonder？”\n But he saw，from the earthly ball，that up and down were one and the same，according as one stood here or there on the rolling globe；and even if he mounted as high as the loftiest mountains of earth rear their heads，to the air which we below call clear and transparent—the pure heaven—a black darkness spread abroad like a cloth，and the sun had a coppery glow and sent forth no rays，and our earth lay wrapped in an orange－coloured mist．How narrow were the limits of the bodily eye，and how little the eye of the soul could see！—how little did even the wisest know of that which is the most important to us all！\n In the most secret chamber of the castle lay the greatest treasure of the earth：the Book of Truth．Leaf for leaf，the wise man read it through：every man may read in this book，but only by fragments．To many an eye the characters seem to tremble，so that the words cannot be put together；on certain pages the writing often seems so pale，so faded，that only a blank leaf appears．The wiser a man becomes，the more he can read；and the wisest read most．For that purpose he knew how to unite the sunlight and the starlight with the light of reason and of hidden powers；and through this stronger light many things came clearly before him from the page．But in the division of the book whose title is“Life after Death”not even one point was to be distinctly seen．That pained him．Should he not he able here upon earth to obtain a light by which everything should become clear to him that stood written in the Book of Truth？\n Like the wise king Solomon，he understood the language of the animals，and could interpret their talk and their songs．But that made him none the wiser．He found out the forces of plants and metals—the forces to be used for the cure of diseases，for delaying death—but none that could destroy death．In all created things that were within his reach he sought the light that should shine upon the certainty of an eternal life；but he found it not．The Book of Truth lay before him with leaves that appeared blank．Christianity showed him in the Bible worde of promise of an eternal life；but he wanted to read it in his book，and in that he saw nothing．\n He had five children—four sons，educated as well as the children of the wisest father could be，and a daughter，fair，mild，and clever，but blind；yet this appeared no loss to her—her father and brothers were eyes to her，and the vividness of her feelings saw for her．\n Never had the sons gone farther from the castle than the branches of the tree extended，still less the sister．They were happy children in the land of childhood—in the beautiful fragrant Tree of the Sun．Like all children，they were very glad when any story was related to them；and the father told them many things that other children would not have understood；but these were just as clever as most grown-up people are among us．He explained to them what they saw in living pictures on the castle walls—the doings of men and the march of events in all the lands of the earth；and often the sons expressed the wish that they could be present at all the great deeds and take part in them；and their father then told them that out in the world it was difficult and toilsome—that the world was not quite what it appeared to them from their beauteous home．He spoke to them of the true，the beautiful，and the good，and told them that these three things held the world together，and that under the pressure they had to endure they became hardened into a precious stone，clearer than the water of the diamond—a jewel whose splendour had value with God，and whose brightness outshone everything，and which was called the“Stone of the Wise”．He told them that just as one through created things could attain to the knowledge of God，so through men themselves one could attain to the certainty that such a jewel as the“Stone of the Wise”existed．He could not tell them any more about it，for he knew no more．This narration would have exceeded the perception of other children，but these children under-stood it，and at length other children，too，will learn to comprehend its meaning．\n They questioned their father concerning the true，the beautiful，and the good；and he explained it to them，told them many things，and told them also that God，when He made man out of the dust of the earth，gave five kisses to His work—fiery kisses，heart kisses—which we now call the five senses．Through these the true，the beautiful，and the good is seen，perceived，and under-stood；through these it is valued，protected，and furthered．Five senses have been given bodily and mentally，inwardly and outwardly，to body and soul．\n The children reflected deeply upon all these things；they meditated upon them by day and night．Then the eldest of the brothers dreamed a splendid dream．Strangely enough，the second brother had the same dream，and the third，and the fourth brother likewise；all of them dreamed exactly the same thing—namely，that each went out into the world and found the“Stone of the Wise”，which gleamed like a beaming light on his forehead when，in the morning dawn，he rode back on his swift horse over the velvety green meadows of his home into the castle of his father；and the jewel threw such a heavenly light and radiance upon the leaves of the book，that everything was illuminated that stood written concerning the life beyond the grave．But the sister dreamed nothing about going out into the wide world：it never entered her mind．Her world was her father\u0027s house．\n “I shall ride forth into the wide world，”said the eldest brother．“I must try what life is like there，and go to and fro among men．I will practise only the good and the true；with these I will protect the beautiful．Much shall change for the better when I am there．”\n Now his thoughts were bold and great，as our thoughts generally are at home in the corner of the hearth，before we have gone forth into the world and have encountered wind and rain，and thorns and thistles．\n In him and in all his brothers the five senses were highly developed，inwardly and outwardly；but each of them had one sense which in keenness and development surpassed the other four．In the case of the eldest this was Sight．This was to do him especial service．He said he had eyes for all time，eyes for all nations，eyes that could look into the depths of the earth，where the treasures lie hid-den，and deep into the hearts of men，as though nothing but a pane of glass were placed before them：he could read more than we can see on the cheek that blushes or grows pale，in the eye that weeps or smiles．Stags and antelopes escorted him to the boundary of his home towards the west，and there the wild swans received him and flew north-west．He followed them．And now he had gone far out into the world—far from the land of his father，that extended east-ward to the end of the earth．\n But how he opened his eyes in astonishment！Many things were here to be seen；and many things appear very different，when a man beholds them with his own eyes，from when he merely sees them in a picture，as the son had done in his father\u0027s house，however faithful the picture may be．At the outset he nearly lost his eyes in astonishment at all the rubbish and all the masquerading stuff put forward to represent the beautiful；but he did not quite lose them，he had other use for them．He wished to go thoroughly and honestly to work in the understanding of the beautiful，the true，and the good．But how were these rep-resented in the world？He saw that often the garland that belonged to the beautiful was given to the hideous；that the good was often passed by without notice，while mediocrity was applauded when it should have been hissed off．People looked to the dress，and not to the wearer；asked for a name，and not for desert；and went more by reputation than by service．It was the same thing everywhere．\n “I see I must attack these things vigorously，”he said，and attacked them with vigour accordingly．\n But while he was looking for the truth，came the Evil One，the father of lies．Gladly would the fiend have plucked out the eyes of this Seer；but that would have been too direct：the devil works in a more cunning way．He let him see and seek the true and the good；but while the young man was contemplating them，the Evil Spirit blew one mote after another into each of his eyes；and such a proceeding would be hurtful even to the best sight．Then the fiend blew upon the motes，so that they became beams；and the eyes were destroyed，and the Seer stood like a blind man in the wide world，and had no faith in it：he lost his good opinion of it and himself；and when a man gives up the world and himself，all is over with him．\n “Over！”said the wild swans，who flew across the sea towards the east．“Over！”twittered the swallows，who likewise flew eastward，towards the Tree of the Sun．That was no good news for those at home．\n “I fancy the Seer must have fared badly，”said the second brother；“but the Hearer may have better for-tune．”For this one possessed the sense of hearing in an eminent degree：he could hear the grass grow，so quick was he to hear．\n He took a hearty leave of all at home，and rode away，provided with good abilities and good intentions．The swallows escorted him，and he followed the swans；and he stood far from his home in the wide world．\n But he experienced the fact that one may have too much of a good thing．His hearing was too fine．He not only heard the grass grow，but could hear every man\u0027s heart beat，in sorrow and in joy．The whole world was to him like a great clockmaker\u0027s workshop，wherein all the clocks were going“tick，tick！”and all the turret clocks striking“ding dong．”It was unbearable．For a long time his ears held out，but at last all the noise and screaming became too much for one man．There came blackguard boys of sixty years old—for it is not age that does it；they roared and shouted in a way that one could laugh at；but then came gossip，which whispered through all houses，lanes，and streets，right out to the high-way．Falsehood thrust itself forward and played the master；the bells on the fool\u0027s cap jangled and declared they were church bells；and the noise became too bad for the Hearer，and he thrust his fingers into both ears；but still he could hear false singing and bad sounds，gossip and idle words，scandal and slander，groaning and moaning without and within．Heaven help us！He thrust his fingers deeper and deeper into his ears，but at last the drums burst．Now he could hear nothing at all ot the good，the true，and the beautiful，for his hearing was to have been the bridge by which he crossed．He became silent and suspicious，trusted no one at last，not even himself，and that is very unfortunate，and，no longer hoping to find and bring home the costly jewel，he gave it up，and gave himself up；and that was the worst of all．The birds who winged their flight to－wards the east brought tidings of this，till the news reached the castle in the Tree of the Sun．\n “I will try now！”said the third brother．“I have a sharp nose！”\n Now that was not said in very good taste；but it was his way，and one must take him as he was．He had a happy temper，and was a poet，a real poet：he could sing many things that he could not say，and many things struck him far earlier than they occurred to others．“I can smell fire！”he said；and he attributed to the sense of smelling，which he possessed in a very high degree，a great power in the region of the beautiful．\n “Every fragrant spot in the realm of the beautiful has its frequenters，he said．“One man feels at home in the atmosphere of the tavern，among the flaring tallow candles，where the smell of spirits mingles with the fumes of bad to-bacco．Another prefers sitting among the overpowering scent of jessamine，or scenting himself with strong clove oil．This man seeks out the fresh sea breeze，while that one climbs to the highest mountain-top and looks down upon the busy little life beneath．”\n Thus he spake．It seemed to him as if he had already been out in the world，as if he had already associated with men and known them．But this experience arose from with－in himself：it was the poet within him，the gift of Heaven，and bestowed on him in his cradle．\n He bade farewell to his paternal roof in the Tree of the Sun，and departed on foot through the pleasant scenery of home．Arrived at its confines，he mounted on the back of an ostrich，which runs faster than a horse；and after－wards，when he fell in with the wild swans，he swung himself on the strongest of them，for he loved change；and away he flew over the sea to distant lands with great forests，deep lakes，mighty mountains，and proud cities；and wherever he came it seemed as if sunshine travelled with him across the fields，for every flower，every bush，every tree exhaled a new fragrance，in the consciousness that a friend and protector was in the neighbourhood，who understood them and knew their value．The crippled rose bush reared up its twigs，unfolded its leaves，and bore the most beautiful roses；every one could see it，and even the black damp Wood Snail noticed its beauty．\n “I will give my seal to the flower，”said the Snail；“I have spit on it，and I can do no more for it．”\n “Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world！”said the poet．\n And he sang a song concerning it，sang it in his own way；but nobody listened．Then he gave the drummer two pence and a peacock\u0027s feather，and set the song for the drum，and had it drummed in all the streets of the town；and the people heard it，and said that they understood it，it was so deep．Then the poet sang several songs of the beautiful，the true，and the good．His songs were listened to in the tavern，where the tallow candles smoked，in the fresh meadow，in the forest，and on the high seas．It appeared as if this brother was to have better fortune than the two others．But the Evil Spirit was angry at this，and accordingly he set to work with incense powder and incense smoke，which he can prepare so artfully as to con－fuse an angel，and how much more therefore a poor poet！The Evil One knows how to take that kind of people！He surrounded the poet so completely with incense，that the man lost his head，and forgot his mission and his home，and at last himself—and ended in smoke．\n But when the little birds heard of this they mourned，and for three days they sang not one song．The black Wood Snail became blacker still，not for grief，but for envy．\n “They should have strewed incense for me，”she said，“for it was I who gave him his idea of the most famous of his songs，the drum song of‘The Way of the World’；it was I who spat upon the rose！I can bring witness to the fact．”\n But no tidings of all this penetrated to the poet\u0027s home in India，for all the birds were silent for three days；and when the time of mourning was over，their grief had been so deep that they had forgotten for whom they wept．That\u0027s the usual way！\n “Now I shall have to go out into the world，to disappear like the rest，”said the fourth brother．\n He had just as good a humour as the third，but he was no poet，and so he had good reason to have good humour．Those two had filled the castle with cheerfulness，and now the last cheerfulness was going away．Sight and hearing have always been looked upon as the two chief senses of men，and as the two that it is most desirable to sharpen；the other senses are looked upon as of less consequence．But that was not the opinion of this son，as he had especially cultivated his taste in every respect，and taste is very powerful．It holds sway over what goes into the mouth，and also over what penetrates into the mind；and consequently this brother tasted everything that was stored up in bottles and pots，saying that this was the rough work of his office．Every man was to him a vessel in which something was seething，every country\n an enormous kitchen，a kitchen of the mind．\n “That was the fine work，”he said；and he wanted to go out and try what was delicate．“Perhaps fortune may be more favourable to me than it was to my brothers，”he said．“I shall start on my travels．But what conveyance shall I choose？Are air balloons invented yet？”he asked his father，who knew of all inventions that had been made or that were to be made．But air balloons had not yet been invented，nor steam-ships，nor railways．“Good：then I shall choose an air balloon，”he said；“my father knows how they are made and guided．Nobody has invented them yet，and consequently the people will believe that it is an aerial phantom．When I have used the balloon I will burn it，and for this purpose you must give me a few pieces of the invention that will be made next—I mean chemical matches．”\n And he obtained what he wanted，and flew away．The birds accompanied him farther than they had flown with the other brothers．They were curious to know what would be the result of the flight，and more of them came sweeping up：they thought he was some new bird；and he soon had a goodly following．The air became black with birds，they came on like a cloud—like the cloud of locusts over the land of Egypt．\n Now he was out in the wide world．\n “I have had a good friend and helper in the East Wind，”he said．\n “The East and the West Wind，you mean，”said the winds．“We have been both at work，otherwise you would not have come north-west．”\n But he did not hear what the winds said，and it does not matter either．The birds had also ceased to accompany him．When they were most numerous，a few of them be-came tired of the journey．Too much was made of this kind of thing，they said．He had got fancies into his head．“There is nothing at all to fly after，there is nothin；it\u0027s quite stupid；”and so they stayed behind，the whole flock of them．\n The air balloon descended over one of the greatest cities，and the aeronaut took up his station on the highest point，on the church steeple．The balloon rose again，which it ought not to have done：where it went to is not known，but that was not a matter of consequence，for it was not yet invented．Then he sat on the church steeple．The birds no longer hovered around him，they had got tired of him，and he was tired of them．\n All the chimneys in the town were smoking merrily．\n “Those are altars erected to they honour！”said the Wind，who wished to say something agreeable to him．\n He sat boldly up there，and looked down upon the people in the street．There was one stepping along，proud of his purse，another of the key he carried at his girdle，though he had nothing to unlock；one proud of his moth-eaten coat，another of his wasted body．\n “Vanity！I must hasten downward，dip my finger in the pot，and taste！”he said．“But for a while I will still sit here，for the wind blows so pleasantly against my back．I\u0027ll sit here as long as the wind blows．I\u0027ll enjoy a slight rest．‘It is good to sleep long in the morning，when one has much to do says the lazy man，but laziness is the root of all evil，and there is no evil in our family．I\u0027ll stop here as long as this wind blows，for it pleases me．\n And there he sat，but he was sitting upon the weathercock of the steeple，which kept turning round and round with him，so that he thought that the same wind still blew；so he might stay up there a goodly while．\n But in India，in the castle in the Tree of the Sun，it was solitary and still，since the brothers had gone away one after the other．\n “It goes not well with them，”said the father；“they will never bring the gleaming jewel home；it is not made for me：they are gone，they are dead！”\n And he bent down over the Book of Truth，and gazed at the page on which he should read of life after death；but for him nothing was to be seen or learned upon it．\n The blind daughter was his consolation and joy；she attached herself with sincere affection to him，and for the sake of his peace and joy she wished the costly jewel might be found and brought home With sorrow and longing she thought of her brothers．Where were they？Where did they live？She wished sincerely that she might dream of them，but it was strange，not even in dreams could she approach them．But at length，one night she dreamed that the voices of her brothers sounded across to her，calling to her from the wide world，and she could not refrain，but went far far out，and yet it seemed in her dream that she was still in her father\u0027s house．She did not meet her brothers，but she felt，as it were，a fire burning in her hand，but it did nothurt her，for it was the jewel she was bringing to her father．When she awoke，she thought for a moment that she still held the stone，but it was the knob of her distaff that she was grasping．During the long nights she had spun incessantly，and round the distaff was turned a thread，finer than the finest web of the spider；human eyes were unable to distinguish the separate threads．She had wetted them with her tears，and the twist was strong as a cable．She rose，and her resolution was taken：the dream must be made a reality．\n It was night，and her father slept．She pressed a kiss upon his hand，and then took her distaff，and fastened the end of the thread to her father\u0027s house．But for this，blind as she was，she would never have found her way home；to the thread she must hold fast，and trust not to herself or to others．From the Tree of the Sun she broke four leaves；these she would confide to wind and weather，that they might fly to her brothers as a letter and a greeting，in case she did not meet them in the wide world．How would she fare out there，she，the poor blind child？But she had the invisible thread to which she could hold fast．She possessed a gift which all the others lacked．This was thoroughness；and in virtue of this it seemed as if she had eyes at the tips of her fingers and cars down in her very heart．\n And quietly she went forth into the noisy，whirling，wonderful world，and wherever she went the sky grew bright—she felt the warm ray—the rainbow spread itself out from the dark cloud through the blue air．She heard the song of the birds，and smelt the scent of orange groves and apple orchards so strongly that she seemed to taste it．Soft tones and charming songs reached her ear，but also howling and roaring，and thoughts and opinions sounded in strange contradiction to each other．Into the innermost depths of her heart penetrated the echoes of human thoughts and feelings．One chorus sounded darkly—\n The life of earth is a shadow vain，\n A night created for sorrow！\n but then came another strain—\n The life of earth is the scent of the rose，\n With its sunshine and its pleasure．\n And if one strophe sounded painfully—\n Each mortal thinks of himself alone，\n This truth has been shown，how often！\n on the other side the answer pealed forth—\n A mighty stream of warmest love\n All through the world shall bear us．\n She beard，indeed，the words—\n In the little petty whirl here below，\n Each thing shows mean and paltry；\n but then came also the comfort—\n Many things great and good are achieved，\n That the ear of man heareth never．\n And if sometimes the mocking strain sounded around her—\n Join in the common cry；with a jest\n Destroy the good gifts of the Giver，\n in the blind girl\u0027s heart a stronger voice repeated—\n To trust in thyself and in God is best；\n His will be done for ever．\n And whenever she entered the circle of human kind，and appeared among young or old，the knowledge of the true，the good，and the beautiful beamed into their hearts．Whether she entered the study of the artist，or the festive decorated hall，or the crowded factory，with its whirring wheels，it seemed as though a sunbeam were stealing in—as if the sweet string sounded，the flower exhaled its per－fume，and a living dew－drop fell upon the exhausted leaf．\n But the Evil Spirit could not see this and be content．He has more cunning than ten thousand men，and he found out a way to compass his end．He betook himself to the marsh，collected little bubbles of the stagnant water，and passed over them a sevenfold echo of lying words to give them strength．Then he pounded up paid－for eulogies and lying epitaphs，as many as he could get，boiled them in tears that envy had shed，put upon them rouge he had scraped from faded cheeks，and of these he composed a maiden，with the aspect and gait of the blessed blind girl，the angel of thoroughness；and then the Evil One\u0027s plot was in full progress．The world knew not which of the two was the true one；and，indeed，how should the world know？\n “To trust in thyself and in God is best；\n His good will be done for ever，”\n sang the blind girl，in full faith．She entrusted the four green leaves from the Tree of the Sun to the winds，as a letter and a greeting to her brothers，and had full confidence that they would reach their destination，and that the jewel would be found which outshines all the glories of the world．From the forehead of humanity it would gleam even to the castle of her father．\n “Even to my father\u0027s house，”she repeated．\n “Yes，the place of the jewel is on earth，and I shall bring more than the promise of it with me．I feel its glow，it swells more and more in my closed hand．Every grain of truth，were it never so fine，which the sharp wind carried up and whirled towards me，I took up and treasured；I let it be penetrated by the fragrance of the beautiful，of which there is so much in the world，even for the blind．I took the sound of the beating heart engaged in what is good，and added it to the first．All that I bring is but dust，but still it is the dust of the jewel we seek，and in plenty．I have my whole hand full of it．”\n And she stretched forth her hand towards her father．She was soon at home—she had travelled thither in the flight of thoughts，never having quitted her hold of the in-visible thread from the paternal home．\n The evil powers rushed with hurricane fury over the Tree of the Sun，pressed with a wind-blast against the open doors，and into the sanctuary．\n “It will be blown away by the wind！”said the father，and he seized the hand she had opened．\n “No，”she replied，with quiet confidence，“it can－not be blown away；I feel the beam warming my very soul．”\n And the father became aware of a glancing flame，there where the shining dust poured out of her hand over the Book of Truth，that was to tell of the certainty of an everlasting life；and on it stood one shining word—one only word—“Faith．”\n And with the father and daughter were again the four brothers．When the green leaf fell upon the bosom of each，a longing for home had seized them and led them back．They had arrived．The birds of passage，and the stag，the antelope，and all the creatures of the forest followed them，for all wished to have a part in their joy．\n We have often seen，where a sunbeam bursts through a crack in the door into the dusty room，how a whirling column of dust seems circling round；but this was not poor and insignificant like common dust，for even the rainbow is dead in colour compared with the beauty which showed it self．Thus，from the leaf of the book with the beaming word “Faith，”arose every grain of truth，decked with the charms of the beautiful and the good，burning brighter than the mighty pillar of flame that led Moses and the children of Israel through the desert to Canaan；and from the word“Faith”went the bridge of Hope the Infinite．\n 聪明人的宝石\n \n 你当然知道《丹麦人荷尔格》这个故事。我不会再讲这个故事给你听，但是我可要问，你记不记得它里面说过：“荷尔格获得了印度广大的国土以后，一直向东走，走到世界的尽头，甚至走到那棵太阳树的跟前。”——这是克利斯仙·贝德生讲的话。你知道贝德生吗？你不知道他也没有什么关系。丹麦人荷尔格把治理印度的一切大权都交给约恩牧师。你知道约恩牧师吗？如果你不知道他，这也不要紧，因为他跟这个故事完全没有关系。你将听到一个关于太阳树的故事。这树是“在印度——那世界的尽头的东方”。人们都是这样说，因为他们没有像我们一样学过地理。不过目前这也没有什么关系！\n 太阳树是一棵华贵的树；我们从来没有看见过它，将来恐怕也永远不会看到它。树顶上的枝叶向周围伸出好几里路远。它本身就是一个不折不扣的树林，因为它每一根顶小的枝子都是一棵树。这上面长着棕榈树、山毛榉、松树和梧桐树，还长着许多其他种类的树——事实上世界各地的树这儿都有了。它们作为小枝从大枝上冒出来，而这些大枝东一个结，西一个弯，好像是溪谷和山丘——上面还盖着天鹅绒般的草地和无数的花朵呢。每一根枝子像一片开满了花的广阔草坪，或者像一个最美丽的花园。太阳向它射着温暖的光，因为它是一株太阳树。\n 世界各个角落里的鸟儿都飞到它上面来：有的来自美洲的原始森林，有的来自大马士革的玫瑰花园，有的来自非洲的沙漠地带——这个地带的大象和狮子以为它们自己是唯一的统治者。南极和北极的鸟儿也飞来了；当然，鹳鸟和燕子也决不会不到场的。但是鸟儿并不是来到这儿的唯一的生物，雄鹿、松鼠、羚羊以及上百种其他会跳的可爱的动物也在这儿住下来。\n 树顶本身就是一个广大的、芬芳的花园。许多巨大的枝桠在它里面像绿色的山丘似地向四周伸展开来。这些山丘之中有一座水晶宫，俯视着世界上所有的国家。它上面的每一座塔看起来都像一朵百合花；人们可以在花梗子里爬上去，因为梗子里有螺旋楼梯；[因此你现在也不难懂得，]人们可以走到叶子上去，因为叶子就是阳台。花萼里有一个美丽、辉煌的圆厅，它的天花板就是嵌着太阳和星星的蔚蓝的天。\n 在下边的宫殿里，那些广大的厅堂也是同样辉煌灿烂的，虽然它们表现的方式不同。整个世界就在那些墙上被反射出来。人们可以看到世界上发生的一切事情。因此人们都没有读报纸的必要，事实上这里也没有什么报纸。人们可以通过活动的图画看到一切东西——这也就是说，你[能够看到、或者]愿意看的那点东西，因为什么东西都有一个限度，就是连聪明人都不能例外，而这儿却住着一个聪明人。\n 这个人的名字很难念。你也念不出来，所以也就不用提它了。人们所知道的事情，或者人们在这个世界上所能知道的事情，他全都知道。每一件已经完成了的发明，或者快要完成的发明，他全都知道。但是除此以外的事情他就不知道了，因为一切究竟还是有一个限度。以聪明著名的君主所罗门，也不过只有他一半的聪明。但这位君主还要算是一个非常聪明的人呢。他统治着大自然的一切威力，管理着所有凶猛的精灵。的确，连死神每天早晨都不得不把当天要死的人的名单送给他看。然而所罗门自己也不能不死。住在太阳树上宫殿里的这位法力很大的主人——这位探讨者——就经常在思索这个问题。不管他的智慧比人类要高多少，总有一天他也不免死亡。他知道，他的子孙也会死亡，正如树林里的叶子会枯萎并且化为尘土一样。他看得出，人类会像树上的叶子一样凋谢，为的是好让新的一代来接替。但是叶子一落下来就再也活不转来；它只有化为尘土，或者成为别的植物的一部分。\n 当死神到来的时候，人会得到一个什么结果呢？死究竟是什么呢？身体消灭了，但是灵魂会怎样呢？它会变成什么呢？它将到什么地方去呢？“到永恒的生命中去，”这是宗教所说的安慰话。但是怎样转变过去呢？人在什么地方生活，同时怎样生活呢？“生活在天上，”虔诚的人说，“我们将要到天上去！”\n “到天上去？”这位聪明人重复着这句话说，同时向太阳和星星凝望。\n “到天上去！”从这个圆形的地球上看，天和地是一体，是同样的东西。这完全要看一个人在这个旋转的球体上从一个什么角度观察而定。如果他爬到地球上最高山的最高峰，那么他就可以看到，我们在下边所谓澄净透明的东西——“苍天”——不过是漆黑一团。它像一块布似地覆在一切东西上面，而太阳在这种情形下也不过是一个不发光的火球，地球上飘着的不过是一层橙黄的烟雾。肉眼的限制是多么大！灵魂的眼睛所能看到的东西是多么少！与我们最有切身关系的事情，即使智慧最高的圣人也只能看到很微小的一点。\n 在这宫殿的一个最秘密的房间里藏着世界上一件最伟大的宝物：《真理之书》。这位圣人一页一页地翻着读。这本书谁都可以读，但是只能读几个片断。在许多人的眼中，这本书上的字母似乎都在发抖，人们没有办法把它们拼成完整的字句。某些页上的字迹很淡，很模糊，看起来好像是一无所有的空页。一个人越具有智慧，他就越能读得懂，因此具有大智的人就能读懂得最多。正因为这个缘故，聪明人知道怎样把太阳光和星光跟理智之光和灵魂的潜在力结合起来。在这种混合的强光中，书页上所写的东西在他面前就显得非常清楚。不过有一章叫做《死后的生活》，这里面没有一个字可以看得清楚。这使他感到非常难过。难道他在这世界上找不到一线光明，使他能看清楚《真理之书》上所写的一切东西吗？\n 他像聪明的国王所罗门一样，懂得动物的语言。他能解释它们所唱的歌和讲的话。但是他并不因此而变得更聪明。他发现了植物和金属的力量——能够治疗疾病和延迟死亡的力量。可是他却找不到制止死亡的办法，他在他所能接触到的一切创造出来的事物之中，希望寻求到一种可以使生命永恒不灭的启示；但是却寻求不到。《真理之书》摆在他面前，但是书页却是一张白纸。基督教在《圣经》里给了他一个关于永恒生命的诺言。但是他希望在自己的书中读到它，当然在这书中他是读不到的。\n 他有5个孩子，其中4个是男孩子；他们都得到一个最聪明的父亲所能供给他们的教育。另外一个是女孩子；她既美丽，又温柔，又聪明，但她却是一个瞎子。然而这不能算是一个缺点。爸爸和哥哥们都是她的眼睛，而她的敏锐的感觉也能看得见东西。\n 儿子们离开宫殿大厅的时候，从来不走出从树干伸出的树枝的那个范围。妹妹更不会走远。他们生活在儿时的家里，在儿时的国度里，在美丽、芬芳的太阳树里，是非常幸福的。像所有的孩子一样，他们非常喜欢听故事。爸爸告诉他们许多别的孩子怎么也听不懂的故事。这些孩子聪明的程度，可以与我们中间的许多成年人相比。他把他们在宫殿墙上所看到的一些活动图画——人所做的事情和世界各国所发生的事情解释给他们听——儿子们也希望他们能够到外面去参加别人所做的一切伟大的事情。爸爸告诉他们说，外边的世界是既艰难而又辛苦，跟他们这个美丽的儿时世界是完全两样。\n 他对他们谈论着真、美和善，而且告诉他们说，这三件东西把世界维系在一起。它们在它们所承担的压力下，凝结成一块宝石。这块宝石的光泽度胜过金刚钻的光泽度。它的光泽就是在上帝的眼中也是非常有价值的。它比什么东西都光亮。它叫做“聪明人的宝石”。他告诉他们说，一个人可以通过创造出来的事物认识上帝；同样，一个人也可通过人类知道“聪明人的宝石”的确存在。他只能告诉他们这一点，他也只知道这一点。这种说法对于别的孩子是很难理解的，不过这些孩子却能够理解。以后别的孩子也可以渐渐理解了。\n 他们问爸爸，什么叫做真、善、美。他一一解释给他们听。他告诉他们很多事情。还说，上帝用泥土造成人，并且还在这个创造物身上吻了5次——火热的吻，心里的吻，[我们上帝的温柔的吻。]我们现在把这叫做5种感官。通过这些感官，我们可以看见、感觉和理解真、善、美，可以判断它们的价值，保护它们和使它们向前发展。我们从身体到思想，从里到外，[从根到顶，]从肉体到灵魂，都具有这5种感官。\n 孩子们把这些事情想了很久，他们日夜都在深思。于是最大的哥哥做了一个美丽的梦。奇怪的是，第二个兄弟也做了同样的梦，接着第三个、第四个也做了同样的梦。每个人恰恰梦见同样的东西。每个人都梦见走向广大的世界，找到了“聪明人的宝石”。梦见有一天大清早，他们各骑着一匹快马穿过家里天鹅绒般的绿草地，走进父亲的城堡里去，这宝石就在每个人的额上射出强烈的光辉。当这宝石的祥光射到书页上的时候，书上所描写的关于死后的生活就全都现出来了。但是妹妹却没有梦见走进广大的世界里去：她连想都没有想到。爸爸的家就是她的世界。\n “我要骑着马到广大的世界里去！”大哥说。“我要体验实际的生活，我要在人群之间来往。我要遵从善和真，我要用善和真来保护美。只要我一去，许多东西就会改观！”\n 的确，他的思想是勇敢和伟大的。当我们待在家中一个温暖的角落里的时候，在我们没有到外面遇见荆棘和风雨以前，我们大家都是这个样子。\n 这5种感官在他和他的几个弟弟身上，里里外外都获得了高度的发展。不过他们每个人都有一种特殊的感官，它的敏锐和发展的程度都超过了其余的4个人。在大哥身上，这是视觉。这对于他有特别的好处。他说，他能看见一切时代，一切国家；他能直接看见地下的宝藏，看见人的心，好像这些东西外面罩着的只不过是一层玻璃。这也就是说，他能看见的东西，不仅仅是脸上所现出的红晕或者惨白，眼睛里的哭泣或者微笑。雄鹿和羚羊陪送他向西走，一直走到边境；野天鹅到这儿来迎接他，然后再向西北飞。他跟着它们走。他现在走到世界辽远的角落，远离他的父亲的国土——一直伸向东、达到世界尽头的国土。\n 但是他的眼睛因惊奇而睁得多么大啊！要看的东西真是太多。不管他在他父亲的房子里看到的图画多么真实，他现在亲眼看见的许多东西，完全跟他在图画中看到的不同。起初，他的眼睛惊奇得几乎失去辨别的能力，因为美是用许多廉价的东西和狂欢节的一些装饰品显现出来的。但是他还没有完全受到迷惑，他的眼睛还没有失去作用。\n 他要彻底地、诚实地花一番功夫来认识美、真和善。但是这几样东西在这个世界上是用什么表示出来的呢？他发现，应该属于美的花束，常常被丑夺去了；善没有被人理会；而应该被嘘下台的劣等东西，却被人鼓掌称赞。人们[只是看到名义，而没有看到实质]；只是看到衣服，而没有看到穿衣服的人；只要虚名，不要美德；只是看到地位，而没有看到才能。处处都是这种现象。\n “是的，我要认真地来纠正这种现象！”他想。于是他就来纠正了。\n 不过当他正在追求真的时候，魔鬼来了。它是欺骗的祖先[，而它本身就是欺骗]。它倒很想把这位观察家的一双眼睛挖下来，但是它觉得这直截了当了。魔鬼的手段是很狡猾的。它让他去观察和寻求真，[而且也让他去观察美]和善；不过当他正在沉思地注视他们的时候，魔鬼就把尘埃吹进他的眼睛里——他的两只眼睛里。魔鬼一粒接着一粒地吹，弄得眼睛完全看不见东西——即使最好的眼睛也看不见。魔鬼一直把尘埃吹成一道光。于是这位观察家的眼睛也就失去作用了。这样，他在这个茫茫的大世界里就成了一个瞎子，同时也失去了信心。他对世界和对自己都没有好感。当一个人对世界和对自己都没有好感的时候，那么他的一切也就都完了。\n “完了！”横渡大海、飞向东方的野天鹅说。“完了！”飞向东方的太阳树的燕子说。这对于家里的人说来，并不是好消息。\n “我想那位‘观察家’的运气大概不太好；”第二个兄弟说。“但是‘倾听者’的运气可能要好些！”这位倾听者的听觉非常敏锐，他甚至连草的生长都能听出来。\n 他高高兴兴地向家人告别。他带着头等的听觉和满腔的善意骑着马走了。燕子跟着他，他跟着天鹅。他离开了家很远，走到茫茫的世界里去。\n 太好了就吃不消——他现在对这句话有了体会。他的听觉太敏锐。他不仅能听到草生长，还能听到每个人的心在悲哀或快乐时的搏动。他觉得这个世界好像一个钟表匠的大工作室，里面所有的钟都在“滴答！滴答！”地响，所有的屋顶上的钟都在敲着：“叮当！叮当！”嗨，这真叫人吃不消！不过他还是尽量地让他的耳朵听下去。最后，这些吵声和闹声实在太厉害，弄得人怎么也支持不了。这时就有一群60岁的野孩子——人不应该以年龄来判断——到来了。他们狂叫了一阵子，使人不禁要发笑。但是这时“谣言”就产生了。它在屋子、大街和小巷里流传着，一直流传到公路上去。“虚伪”高声叫喊起来，想当首领。愚人帽上的铃铛响起来，自称是教堂的钟声。这些噪音弄得“倾听者”太吃不消了。他马上用指头塞住两个耳朵。但是他仍然能听到虚伪的歌声，邪恶的喧闹声，以及谣言和诽谤。不值半文钱的废话从嘴里飞溅出来，吵嚷不休。里里外外都是号叫、哀鸣和喧闹。请上帝大发慈悲！他用手指把耳朵塞得更紧，更深，弄得后来把耳鼓都顶破了。现在他什么也听不见了。他也听不见美、真和善的声音，因为听觉是通到他的思想的一座桥梁。他现在变得沉默起来，怀疑起来。他什么人也不相信；最后连自己也不相信了——这真是一件非常不幸的事情，他再也不想去找那块宝贵的宝石，把它带到家里。他完全放弃了这个念头，也放弃了自己——这是最糟糕的事情。飞向东方的鸟儿带着这个消息，送到太阳树里的父亲的城堡里去。[那时没有邮政，因此也没有回信。]“我现在要试一试！”第三个兄弟说。“我有一个很敏锐的鼻子！”\n 这话说得不太雅观，但是他却这样说了，你不得不承认他是这样一个人物。他的心情老是很好。他是一个诗人，一个真正的诗人。有许多事情他说不出来，但是唱得出来。有许多东西他比别人感觉得早些。\n “人家心中想象的事情我都可以嗅得出来！”他说。他有高度发达的嗅觉；这扩大了他对于美的知识。\n [“有的人喜欢苹果香，有的人喜欢马厩的气味！”他说。]“在美的领域里，每一种气味都有它的群众。有的人喜欢酒店的那种气味，包括冒烟的蜡烛、酒和廉价烟草的混合气味。有的人喜欢坐在强烈的素馨花香中，或者把浓郁的丁香花油喷得满身都是。有的人喜欢寻找清新的海风，有的人喜欢登最高的山顶，俯视下面那些忙碌的众生。”\n 这是他说的话。看样子好像他从前曾经到过这茫茫的大世界，好像他曾经跟人有过来往，而且认识他们。不过这种知识是从他的内心产生的，因为他是一个诗人——这是当他在摇篮里的时候，我们的上帝赐给他的一件礼物。\n 他告别了藏在太阳树里的父母的家。他在故乡美丽的风景中步行出去，但是当他一走出了边境以后，就骑上一只鸵鸟，因为鸵鸟比马跑得快些。后来当他看到一群野天鹅的时候，就爬到一只最强壮的野天鹅的背上。他喜欢换换口味。他飞过大海，飞向一个拥有大树林、深湖、雄伟的山和美丽的城市的、陌生的国家。他无论向什么地方走，总是似乎觉得太阳在田野上跟着他。每一朵花，每一个灌木丛，都发出一种强烈的香气，因为它们知道一位爱护它们和了解它们的朋友和保护者就在它们附近。一丛凋零的玫瑰花也竖起枝子，展开叶儿，开出最美丽的花来。每个人都可以看得见它的美，甚至树林里潮湿的黑蜗牛也注意到它的美。\n “我要在这朵花上留下一点纪念！”蜗牛说。“我要在花上吐一口唾沫，因为我没有别的东西！”\n “世界上的美的东西的命运就是这样！”诗人说。\n 于是他唱了一首关于它的歌，是用他自己特有的一种调子唱的；但是谁也不听。因此他送给一位鼓手两个银毫和一根孔雀毛，叫他把这支歌编成拍子，在这城市的大街小巷中用鼓把它传播出去。大家都听到了，而且还听得懂——它的内容很深奥！诗人唱着关于美、真和善的歌。人们在充满了蜡烛烟味的酒店中，在新鲜的草原上，在树林里，在广阔的海上听着他的歌。看样子，这位兄弟的运气要比其他的两位好得多。\n 但是魔鬼却对此很生气，于是它立刻着手吹起香粉，燃起香烟。它的手段实在是非常高明，这些烟的气味连安琪儿都能给迷住，一个可怜的诗人当然更不在话下。魔鬼是知道怎样对付这种人的。它用香烟把这个诗人层层包住，把他弄得昏头昏脑，结果他忘掉了他的任务和他的家，最后他把自己也忘掉了。他在烟雾中死去了。\n 当所有的小鸟听到这个消息的时候，都感到非常伤心。它们有三天没有唱歌。树林里的黑蜗牛变得更黑——这并不是因为它伤心，而是因为它嫉妒。\n “香烟应该是为我而焚的，”它说，“因为他的这首最驰名的、叫做‘世事’的击鼓歌是受了我的启发而写的，玫瑰花上的粘液就是我吐出来的！我可以提出证明。”\n 不过这件消息没有传到诗人在印度的家里，因为所有的鸟儿三天没有唱歌。当哀悼期结束以后，它们就感到非常悲痛，它们甚至忘记了自己是为什么人而哭。事情就是这样！\n “现在我要到外面的世界上去，像别的兄弟一样远行！”第四个兄弟说。\n 他像刚才说的那个兄弟一样，心情也非常好；不过他并非诗人。因此他的心情好是理所当然。这两个兄弟使整个宫殿充满了快乐，但是现在连这最后的快乐也要没有了。视觉和听觉一直被认为是人类最重要的两种感官，所以谁都希望这两种感官变得敏锐。其余的三种感官一般都认为是不太重要的。不过这位少爷却不是如此想法。他尤其注重从各方面培养他的味觉，而他的味觉非常强烈，范围也广。凡是放进嘴里和深入心里的东西，都由它来控制。因此罐子里和锅里的东西，瓶子里和桶里的东西，他都要尝一下。他说，这是他的工作中的粗活儿。对于他来说，每个人都是一个炒菜的锅，每个国家是一个庞大的厨房——思想的厨房。\n “这是一件细致的事情，”他说。他现在就要到外面的世界去研究一下，究竟它细致到什么程度。\n “可能我的运气要比我的几个哥哥好些！”他说。“我要去了。但是我用什么工具去旅行呢？人们发明了气球没有？”他问他的父亲。这个老头儿知道已经发明过的和快要发明的一切东西，不过气球还没有人发明出来，汽船和铁路也没有发明出来。\n “好吧，那么我就乘气球吧！”他说。“我的父亲知道怎样制造它，怎样驾驶它，[我将要学习使用它]。现在还没有谁把它发明出来，因此大家会认为它是一个空中幻影。我用过气球以后，就把它烧掉。因此你必须给我一些下次发明的零件——也就是所谓化学火柴！”\n 他所需要的东西他都得到了。于是他就飞走了。鸟儿陪着他飞了一程——比陪着其他几个兄弟飞得远。它们很想看看，这次飞行会有一个什么结果。鸟儿越来越多，因为它们都很好奇：它们以为现在飞行的这个家伙是一只什么新的鸟儿。是的，现在他的朋友倒是不少！天空都被这些鸟儿遮黑了。它们像一大块乌云似地飞来，像飞在埃及国土上的蝗虫。他就是这样向广大的世界里飞去的。\n “东风是我的好朋友，是帮助我的人，”他说。\n “你是指东风和西风吗？”风儿说。“我们两个人一同合作，否则你就不会飞到西北方来了！”\n 但是他却没有听到风儿说的话，因此这等于不说。鸟儿现在也不再陪着他飞了。当它们的数目一多的时候，就有好几只对于飞行感到厌烦起来。这简直是小题大做！它们这样说，他的脑子里装的完全是一堆幻想。“跟他一起飞毫无道理，完全是浪费！完全是胡闹！”于是它们就都回去了，全体都回去了。\n 气球在一个最大的城市上空降落。气球的驾驶人在最高的一点停下来——在教堂的尖塔顶上。气球又升起来了；这种事情实在不应该发生。它究竟要飞到什么地方去呢，谁也不知道；不过这也没有什么了不起的关系，因为它还没有被人发明出来。\n 他坐在教堂的尖塔顶上。身边再没有什么鸟儿在飞，因为它们对他感到厌烦，而他对它们也感到厌烦。\n 城里所有的烟囱都在快活地冒烟。\n “这都是为你而建立起来的祭坛！”风儿说。它想对他说点愉快的事情。\n 他目空一切地坐在那上面，俯视着街上的人群。有一个人走过去，对于自己的钱包感到骄傲；另一个对于悬在自己腰上的钥匙感到得意，虽然他并没有锁着什么宝贵的东西。还有一个人对自己虫蛀了的上衣感到骄傲，另外还有一个人觉得他那个无用的身躯很了不起。\n “这全是虚荣！我必须赶快爬下去，把手指伸进罐子里，尝尝里面的味道！”他说。“但是我还不如在这儿坐一会儿。风吹在我的背上怪舒服的[——这是一桩很大的快事。]风吹多久，我就坐多久。我要在这里休息一会儿。懒人说，一个人的事情多，就应该在早晨多睡一会儿。不过懒是万恶之本，而我们家里并没有什么恶事。[我敢于这样说，所有的人也这样说。]风吹多久，我就要在这儿坐多久。我喜欢这味道。”\n 于是他就坐下来，不过他是坐在风信鸡上，而风信鸡是随着他转的，因此他以为风向一直没有变。他坐着，而且可以一直坐下去欣赏风吹的滋味。\n 但是在印度，太阳树里的宫殿是空洞和寂寞的，因为那儿的几个兄弟就这样一个接着一个地离去了。\n “他们的遭遇并不好！”父亲说。“他们永远也不会把那颗亮晶晶的宝石拿回来。那不是我能够获得的。他们都走了，死去了！”\n 他低下头来读着《真理之书》。书页上写着关于死后生活的问题。不过他什么也看不见，什么也不知道。\n 他的盲目的女儿是他唯一的安慰和快乐。她对他怀着真诚的感情。为了他的快乐和安宁，她希望那颗宝石能够寻到，带回家来。她悲哀地、渴望地思念着她的几个哥哥，他们在什么地方呢？他们住在什么地方呢？她希望能够在梦中见到他们，不过说来也奇怪，即使在梦中她也见不到他们。最后她总算做了一个梦，听到了几个哥哥的声音。他们在外面广大的世界里呼唤她。她不得不走出去，走得很远。但是又似乎觉得她仍然在父亲的屋子里。她没有遇见几个哥哥，不过她觉得手上有火在烧。但是火烧得并不痛，原来那颗亮晶晶的宝石就在她的手上。她要把它送给她的父亲。\n 当她醒来以后，有一忽儿还觉得手中捏着那颗宝石。事实上，她捏着的是纺车的把手。她经常在漫漫长夜里纺纱。她在纺锤上纺出了一根比最细的蜘蛛丝还要细的线。肉眼是看不见这根线的。她用眼泪把它打湿了，因此它比锚索还要结实。她从床上爬起来，下了一个决心，要把这个梦变成真事。\n 这正是黑夜，她的父亲还在睡觉。她吻了他的手。她拿起纺锤，把那根线的一端联在父亲的屋子上。的确，要不是这样做，她这样一个瞎子将永远不会找到家的。她必须紧紧地捏着这根线，而且必须依靠它，自己和别人都是靠不住的。她从太阳树上摘下4片叶子，委托风和雨把它们作为她的信和问候带给她的4个哥哥，因为她怕在这广阔的大世界里遇不见他们。\n 她这个可怜的小瞎子，她在外面的遭遇是怎样的呢？她有那根看不见的线可以作为依靠。她有哥哥们全都缺少的一种官能：敏感性。有了这种敏感性，她的手指就好像是眼睛，她的心就好像是耳朵。\n 她一声不响地走进这个熙熙攘攘的、忙忙碌碌的新奇的世界。她走到的地方，天空就变得非常明朗。她可以感觉到温暖的太阳光。虹从乌黑的云层里现出来，悬在蔚蓝色的天空上。她听见鸟儿在唱着歌；她能够闻到橙子和苹果园的香气。这种香气是那么强烈，她几乎觉得自己尝到了果子的味道。她听到柔和的音调和美妙的歌声，但是她也听到号哭和吼叫。思想和判断彼此起了不调和的冲突。人的思想和感情在她的心的最深处发出回响。这形成一个合唱：\n 人间的生活不过是一个幻影——\n 一个可以使我们哭泣的黑夜！\n 但是另外一支歌又升起来了：\n 人间的生活是一个玫瑰花丛，\n 充满了太阳光，充满了欢乐。\n 接着又有一个这样痛苦的调子唱出来了：\n 每个人只是为自己打算，\n 我们多少次都认识到了这个真理。\n 于是来了一个响亮的回答：\n 爱的河流在不停地流，\n 在我们人间的生活中流！\n 她听到了这样的话语：\n 世上的一切都是非常渺小，\n 无论什么东西，有利必有弊。\n 但是她又听到安慰的声音：\n 世上伟大和善良的东西不知多少，\n 只是一般的人很难知道！\n 有时从各处飘来一阵嘲讽的曲调\n 笑吧，把一切东西当作一个玩笑！\n 笑吧，跟犬吠声一起发笑！\n 但是盲女子的心中有另外一个更响的歌声：\n 依靠你自己，依靠上帝，\n 上帝的意志总会实现，[阿门]！\n 在所有的男人和女人、老年人和少年人的心中，只要她一到来，真、美、善的光辉就闪耀起来了。她走到哪里——在艺术家的工作室里也好，在金碧辉煌的大厅里也好，在机声隆隆、拥挤不堪的工厂里也好——哪里就似乎有太阳光射进来，有音乐奏起来，有花香喷来，枯叶子也似乎得到了新鲜的露水。\n 但是恶魔却不喜欢这种情况。它的狡猾超过了不只万人；它总有办法达到它的目的。它走到沼泽地上去，它收集一大堆死水的泡沫，它在这些泡沫上注入7倍以上的谎言的回音，使这些谎言更有力量。于是它尽量收集许多用钱买来的颂词和骗人的墓志铭，把这些东西捣碎，再放进“嫉妒”哭出来的眼泪中煮开，然后再加上一位小姐的干枯的脸上的胭脂。它把这些东西塑成一个姑娘。她在体态和动作上跟那个虔诚的盲女子是一模一样——人们把她叫做“温柔的、真诚的安琪儿”。魔鬼的巧计就这样成功了。世人都不知道，她们之中究竟哪一个是真的。的确，世人怎么能够知道呢？\n 依靠你自己，依靠上帝，\n 上帝的意志总会实现[阿门]！\n 盲女满怀信心地唱着这支歌。她把她从太阳树上摘下的那4片叶子交给风雨，作为她带给她哥哥们的信和问候。她相信，这些信一定能够到达他们的手里，同时那颗宝石也一定找得到，这颗宝石的光辉将会超过世上一切的光辉；它将从人的额上一直射到她的父亲的宫殿里去。\n “射到父\n \n
