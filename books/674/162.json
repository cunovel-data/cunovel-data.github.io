{"id":28170,"no":162,"title":"THE COURT CARDS","content":"OH， so many dainty things can be cut out of paste- board and pasted together！ In this fashion there was cutand pasted a castle so large that it took up a whole tabletop， and it was painted so that it seemed to be built outof red brick． It had a shining copper roof； it had towersand a drawbridge； the water in the canals looked likeplate glass， which is just wtat it was； and in the topmosttower there stood a watchman cut out of wood． He had atrumpet， but he didn\u0027 t blow it．\n All this belonged to a little boy named William． Heraised and then lowered the drawbridge himself， and madehis tin soldiers march over it．He opened the castle gateto peep into the spacious reception hall， where all theface cards from a pack—Hearts，Diamonds， Clubs and Spades—hung in frames upon the wall， like portraits in areal reception hall．The Kings each held a scepter and wore a crown．The Queens wore flowing veils over their shoulders， and in their hands each held a flower or a fan．The Knaves had halberds and nodding plumes．\n One evening the little boy peered through the open gates of the castle to have a look at the Court Cards in thereception hall．It seemed to him that the Kings saluted him with their scepters， the Queen of Spades waved the golden tulip she held， the Queen of Hearts raised her fan， and all four Queens graciously took notice of him．As he came a little closer to get a better view， his headstruck against the castle and shook it．Then the four Knaves， of Hearts， Diamonds， Clubs， and Spades， liftedtheir halberds to warn him not to try to press his way through．\n The little boy understood，and gave them a friendly nod．He nodded again，and then he said：\"Say some－ thing，\"but the Court Cards said not a word．However， when he nodded a third time to the Knave of Hearts， theKnave jumped out of his card and placed himself in the middle of the floor．\n \"What\u0027s your name？\"he asked the youngster．\"You have bright eyes and good teeth， but you don\u0027t wash yourhands often enough．\"This was not a very polite way to talk．\n \"My name is william，\"said the youngster．\"This castle is mine，and you are my Knave of Hearts．\"\n \"I\u0027m my King\u0027s and my Queen\u0027s Knave， not yours，\"said the Knave of Hearts．\"I can get off of the card and outof the frame too． So can my gracious King and Queen， even more easily than I． We can march right out into the wide world， but that\u0027 s such a tiresome journey， and wehave grown weary of it．It\u0027s more convenient，and more pleasant for us to be sitting in the cards， just being our-selves．\"\n \"Were all of you really human beings once？\"asked the youngster．\n \"Human beings？\" the Knave of Hearts said．\"Yes， but we were not as good as we should have been． Now please light a little wax candle for me． I\u0027d like a red onebest， for red is the color of my King and Queen．Then I shall tell our whole story to the lord of the castle—I be－lieve you said you were lord of the castle， didn\u0027t you？Butdon\u0027t interrupt me． If I speak， there must not be theslightest interruption．\"\n \"Do you see my King—the King of Hearts？Of these four kings， he is the oldest， the first-born． He was born with a golden crown and a golden apple， and he began to rule immediately． His Queen was born with a golden fan．\n She still has it． They had a wonderful time， even inchildhood． They did not have to go to school． They couldamuse themselves all day long， building up castles and knocking them down，setting up tin soldiers，and playing with dolls．If they asked for a slice of bread and butter， their bread was buttered on both sides and nicely sprin－ kled with brown sugar too． This was in the good old days which were called the golden age，but they tired of it all，and so did I． Yes， those were the good old days！—and then the King of Diamonds took over the government．\"\n The Knave didn\u0027t say any more．The little boy wait－ ed to hear something else，but not a syllable was spoken， so after a while he asked，\"What then？\"\n The Knave of Hearts made him no answer．He stood erect and silent， with his eyes fixed on the burning waxcandle．[The youngster nodded， and nodded again， buthe got no response．] He then turned to the Knave of Dia-\n monds， and when he had nodded to him three times theKnave leaped from the card to the center of the floor．He said only two words：\"Wax candle！\"\n Understanding what he wanted， little William atonce lighted a red candle and placed it before him． The Knave of Diamonds presented arms with his halberd， andsaid：\n \"Then the King of Diamonds came to the throne—a King with a pane of glass in his chest．The Queen also had a pane of glass in her chest， so people could look right inside them， though in all other respects they were shaped as normal human beings．They were so pleasant that a monument was raised in their honor． It stood with－ out falling for seven whole years， but it was built to standforever．\"The Knave of Diamonds presented arms and stared at the red wax candle．\n Immediately， without any nod of encouragement from little William， the Knave of Clubs stepped down， as seri－ ous as the stork that strides with such dignity across the meadow． like a bird， the black three-leafed clover in thecorner of the card flew past the Knave and back again， tofit itself where it had fitted before． Without waiting for his wax candle—as the other knaves had done—the Knave of Clubs said：\n \"Not everyone gets his bread buttered on both sides and powdered with sugar．My King and Queen had none of that． They were compelled to go to school and learn what they had not learned before．They too had panes of glass in their chests， but nobody looked through the glass except to see if something was wrong with their works inside，[and if possible to find out some reason for scolding them．] I know it．I have served my King and Queen all my lile long．I know all about them， and I obey all their orders． They commanded me to say nothing more tonight， so I keep si－ lence and present arms．\"\n But William lighted a candle for this Knave too—a candle， white as snow．Quickly—[even more quickly than the candle was lighted]—the Knave of Spades appeared [in the center of the hall．] He hurried along， yet helimped as if he had a lame leg．[It creaked and cracked asif it had once been broken．Yes，he had met with many ups and downs in his life．]Now he spoke：\n \"Yes， you have each got a candle， and I shall getone too． I know that． But if we Knaves are honored sohighly，our kings and Queens should have triple honors．\n [And it is right that My king and Queen should have four candles each． Their story and trials are so sad and unhappy that they have good reason to dress in mourning and to wear a grave－digger\u0027s spade on their coat of arms．] Poor Knave that I am， in one game of cards I have been micknamed \u0027Black Peter．\u0027 Yes！ But I have a name that isn\u0027t even fitto mention．\"So he whispered，\"In another game I am nicknamed\u0027Dirty Mads\u0027—I who was once first cavalier to the King of Spades．Now I am last！The history of my royal master and mistress I will not tell，[for they do not wish me to do so．] The little lord of the castle may imagine their story for himself if he will，but it is a most melan－ choly one． They have sunk pretty low， and their fate is not apt to change for the better until we all go riding on the red horse， higher than there are clouds．\"\n And little William proceeded to light three candles apiece for the Kings， and three for the Queens．[But for the King and Queen of Spades， he lighted four candles apiece，]and the whole reception hall became as dazzlinglybright as the wealthiest emperor\u0027s palace． The four Kingsand Queens made each other serene bows and gracious curtsies． The Queen of Hearts fluttered her golden fan，and the Queen of Spades twirled her golden tulip in a wheel of fire． The royal couples came down from their cards and frames to move in a graceful minuet across the floor．[They were dancing in and out among the candle flames， and the Knaves were dancing too． ] [Suddenly the entire reception hall was ablaze．The fire roared up through the windows and the walls， and ev－ erything was a curtain of flames that crackled and hissed．] The whole castle was wrapped in fire and smoke．William was frightened．He ran shouting to his father and mother，\"Fire，fire！ My castle\u0027s on fire！\" Itsparkled and blazed， but from the flames it sang：\n \"Now we are riding the red horse， higher than the clouds． This is the way it behooves Kings and Queens to go．And this is the way it behooves their Knaves to fol－ low．\"\n Yes！That was the end of William\u0027s castle，and of the Court Cards． William is still alive， and he washes hishands． It was not his fault that the castle burned．\n 纸牌\n \n 人们能够用纸剪出和剪贴出多少可爱的东西来啊！小小的威廉就这样贴出了一个宫殿。它的体积很大，占满了整个桌面。它涂上了颜色，好像它就是用红砖砌的，而且还有发亮的铜屋顶呢。它有塔，也有吊桥；河里的水，[朝下面一望，]就好像是镜子——它的确是镜子做的。在最高的那个塔上还有一个木雕的守塔人。他有一个可以吹的号筒，但是他却不去吹。\n 这个小孩子亲自拉起或放下吊桥，把锡兵放在吊桥上列队走过，打开宫殿的大门，朝那个宽大的宴会厅里窥望。厅里挂着许多镶在镜框里的画像。这都是从纸牌里剪出来的：红心、方块、梅花和黑桃等。国王们头上戴着王冠，手中拿着王节；王后们戴着面纱，一直垂到肩上。她们的手里还拿着花。杰克拿着戟和摇摆着的羽毛。\n 有一天晚上，这个小家伙朝敞开的宫殿大门偷偷地向大厅里窥望。它的墙上挂着的许多花纸牌。它们真像大殿上挂着的古老画像。他觉得国王似乎在用王节向他致敬，黑桃王后在摇着她手里的郁金香，红心王后在举起她的扇子。四位王后都客气地表示注意到了他。为了要看得仔细一点，他就把头更向前伸，结果撞着了宫殿，把它弄得摇动起来。这时红心、方块、梅花和黑桃的四位杰克就举起戟，警告他不要再向前顶，[因为他的头太大了。] 小家伙点点头，接着又点了一次。然后他说：“请讲几句话吧！”但是花纸牌一句话也不说。不过当他对红心杰克第三次点头的时候，后者就从纸牌——[它像一个屏风似的挂在墙上——里跳出来。他站在中央，帽子上的那根羽毛摇动着，手里拿着一根铁皮包着的长矛。]\n “你叫什么名字？”他问这个小家伙。“你有明亮的眼睛和整齐的牙齿，但是你的手却洗得不勤！”\n 这句话当然是说得不客气的。\n “我叫威廉，”小家伙说。“这个宫殿就是属于我的，所以你就是我的红心杰克！”\n “我是我的国王和王后的杰克，不是你的！”红心杰克说。“我可以从牌里走出来，从框架里走出来；比起我来，我高贵的主人更可以走出来。我们可以一直走到广大的世界上去，不过我们已经出去厌了。坐在纸牌里，保持我们的本来面目，要比那样舒服和愉快得多。”\n “难道你们曾经是真正的人吗？”小家伙问。\n “当然是的！”红心杰克说，“不过不够好就是了。请你替我点一根蜡烛吧——最好是一根红的，因为这就是我的、也是我的主人的颜色。这样，我就可以把我们的故事告诉给宫殿的所有人——因为你说过，你就是这个宫殿的所有人。不过请你不要打断我。如果我讲故事，那就得一口气讲完！”\n 于是他就讲了：\n “这里有四个国王，他们都是兄弟；不过红心国王的年纪最大，因为他一生下来就有一个金王冠和金苹果，他立刻就统治起国家来。他的王后生下来就有一把金扇子——[你可以看得出来，]她现在仍然有。他们的生活过得非常愉快，他们不须上学校，他们可以整天地玩耍。他们造起宫殿，又把它拆下来；他们做锡兵，又和玩偶玩耍。如果他们要吃黄油面包，面包的两面总是涂满了黄油的，而且还撒了些红糖。那要算是一个最好的时候，不过日子过得太好人们也就会生厌了。他们就是这样——于是方块就登基了！”\n “结果是怎样呢？”小家伙问，不过红心杰克再也不开口了。他笔直地站着，望着那根燃着的红蜡烛。\n 结果就是如此。小家伙只好向方块杰克点头。他点了三次以后，方块杰克就从纸牌里跳出来，笔直地站着，说了这两个字：“蜡烛。”！\n 小家伙马上点起一根红蜡烛，放在他的面前。方块杰克举起他的戟致敬，同时把故事接着讲下去。[我们现在把他的话一字不漏地引下来：] “接着方块国王就登基了！”他说，“这位国王的胸口上有一块玻璃，王后的胸口上也有一块玻璃，人们可以望见他们的内心，而他们的内脏和普通人也没有什么两样。他们是两个可爱的人，因此大家为他们建立了一个纪念碑。这个纪念碑竖了足足七年没有倒，虽然它是为了要永垂不朽而建立的。”\n 方块杰克敬了礼，于是就呆呆地望着那根红蜡烛。小小的威廉还来不及点头，梅花杰克就一本正经地走下来了，正好像一只鹳鸟在草地上走路的那副样儿。纸牌上的那朵梅花也飞下来了，像一只鸟儿似的向外飞走，而且它的翅膀越变越大。它在他头上飞过去，然后又飞回到墙边的那个白纸牌上来，钻到它原来的位置上去。梅花杰克和前面的那两位杰克不同，没有要求点一根蜡烛就讲话了：\n “不是每一个人都能吃到两面涂满了黄油的面包的。我的国王和王后就没有吃到过。[他们是最应该吃的，]不过他们得先到学校里去学习国王不曾学过的东西。他们的胸口也有一块玻璃，不过人们看它的时候只是想知道它里面的机件出毛病没有。我了解情况，因为我一直就在为他们做事——我现在还在为他们做事，服从他们的命令。我听他们的话，我现在敬礼！”[于是他就敬礼了。] 威廉也为他点起一根蜡烛——一根雪白的蜡烛。\n 黑桃杰克忽然站出来了。[他并没有敬礼，]他的腿有点跛。\n “你们每个人都有了一根蜡烛，”他说，“我知道我也应该有一根！不过假如我们杰克都有一根，我们的主人就应该有三根了。[我是最后一个到来，我们已经是很没有面子了，人们在圣诞节]还替我起了一个绰号：故意把我叫做‘哭丧的贝尔’，[谁也不愿意我在纸牌里出现。]是的，我还有一个更糟糕的名字——说出来真不好意思：人们把我叫做‘烂泥巴’。我这个人起初还是黑桃国王的骑士呢，但现在我可是最末的一个人了。我不愿意叙述我主人的历史。你是这位宫殿的所有人，如果你想知道的话，请你自己去想象吧。不过我们是在下降，不是在上升，除非有一天我们骑着枣红马向上爬，爬得比云还高。”\n 于是小小的威廉在每一个国王和每一个王后面前点了三根蜡烛，骑士的大殿里真是大放光明，比在最华贵的宫廷里还要亮。这些高贵的国王和王后们客客气气地彼此致敬，红心王后摇着她的金扇子，黑桃王后捻着她那朵金郁金香——它亮得像燃着的火，像燎着的焰花。\n 这高贵的一群跳到大殿中来，舞着，[一忽儿像火光；一忽儿像焰花。]整个宫殿像一片焰火，威廉惊恐地跳到一边，大声地喊：“爸爸！妈妈！\n 宫殿烧起来了！”宫殿在射出火花，在烧起来了：\n “现在我们骑着枣红马爬得很高，比云还要高， 爬到最高的光辉灿烂中去。这正是合乎国王和王后的身份。杰克们跟上来吧！”\n 是的，威廉的宫殿和他的花纸牌就这样完事了。威廉现在还活着，也常常洗手。\n 他的宫殿烧掉了，这不能怪他。\n 这篇童话最初发表在1869年1月纽约出版的《青少年河边杂志》上。从1868年到1872年间安徒生陆续给这个刊物提供新的童话，每篇得50美元的稿酬，条件是这篇作品只能在美国发表一个月以后才得在别的地方刊出。所以这篇作品直到 1909年才在丹麦的《圣诞节之书》（ Juleboger）上刊出，这已经是安徒生逝世24年以后的事了。\n \n
