{"id":28165,"no":157,"title":"GOD CAN NEVER DIE","content":"IT was a Sunday morning．The sun shone brightly and warmly into the room， as the air， mild and refreshing， flowed through the open window． And out under God\u0027sblue heaven， where fields and meadows were covered with greens and flowers， all the little birds rejoiced． While joy and contentment were everywhere outside， in the house lived sorrow and misery． Even the wife， who otherwise always was in good spirits， sat that morning at the breakfasttable with a downcast expression； finally she arose，withouthaving touched a bite of her food， dried her eyes， andwalked toward the door． It really seemed as if there were a curse hanging over this house． The cost of living was high， the food supply low；taxes had become heavier and heavier；year after year the household belongings had depreciated more and more， and now at last there was nothing to look forward to but poverty and misery． For a long time all this had depressedthe husband， who always had been a bard－working andlaw-abiding citizen；now the thought of the future filledhim with despair； yes， many times he even threatened to end his miserable and hopeless existence．Neither the com- forting words of his good－humored wife nor the worldly or spiritual counsel of his friends had helped him； these had only made him more silent and sorrowful． It is easy to un－ derstand that his poor wife finally should lose her courage，too．However，there was quite another reason for her sad－ ness， which we soon shall hear． When the husband saw that his wife also grieved and wanted to leave the room，he stopped her and said，\"I won\u0027t let you go until you have told me what is wrong with you！\" After a moment of silence， she sighed and said， \"Oh， my dear husband，I dreamed last night that God was dead，and that all the angels followed Him to His grave！\" \"How can you believe or think such foolish stuff！\"answered the husband．\"You know，of course，that Godcan never die！\" The good wife\u0027s face sparkled with happiness，andas she affectionately squeezed both her husband\u0027s hands，she exclaimed，\"Then our dear God is still alive！\" \"Why， of course，\" said the husband．\" How couldyou ever doubt it！\" Then she embraced him， and looked at him with loving eyes，ex－ pressing confidence， peace， and happiness， as she said，\" But， my dear husband， if God is still alive， why do we not believe and trust in Him！ He has counted every hair on our heads；not a single one is lost without His knowledge． He clothes the lilies in the field；He feeds the sparrows and the ravens．\" It was as if a veil lifted from his eyes and as if a heavy load fell from his heart when she spoke these words． He smiled for the first time in a longwhile， and thanked his dear， pious wife for the trick shehad played on him，through which she had revied his belief in God and restored his trust． And in the room thesun shone even more friendly on the happy people\u0027s faces； a gentle breeze caressed their smiling cheeks， andthe birds sang even louder their heartfelt thanks to God． 老上帝还没有灭亡 这是一个礼拜天的早晨，射进房间里来的阳光是温暖的，明朗的。柔和的新鲜空气从敞开的窗子流进来。在外面，在上帝的蓝天下，田野和草原上都长满了植物，开满了花朵；所有的小鸟儿都在这里欢乐地唱着歌。外面是一片高兴和愉快的景象，但屋子里却充满了愁苦和悲哀、甚至那位平时总是兴高采烈的主妇，这一天也坐在早餐桌旁边显得愁眉不展。最后她站起来，一口饭也没有吃，揩干眼泪，向门口走去。 从表面上看来，上天似乎对这个屋子降下了灾难。国内的生活费用很高，粮食的供应又不足；捐税在不断地加重，屋子里的资财在一年一年地减少。最后，这里已经没有什么东西了，只剩下贫困和悲哀。这种情况一直把丈夫压得喘不过气来。他向来是一个勤俭、安分守己的公民；现在他一想到未来就感到毫无出路。的确，有好几次他想结束他这种愁苦而无安慰的生活。他的妻子，不管心情是多么好，不管她讲什么话，却无法帮助他。他的朋友，不管替他出什么世故的和聪明的主意，也安慰不了他。相反，他倒因此变得更沉默和悲哀起来。因此不难理解，他的可怜的妻子最后也不得不失去勇气。不过她的悲哀却具有完全不同的性质，我们马上就可以知道。 当丈夫看到自己的妻子也变得悲哀起来，而且还想离开这间屋子的时候，他就把她拉回来，对她说：“你究竟有什么不乐意的事情？在你没有讲清楚以前，我不能让你出去。” 她沉默了一会儿，深深地叹了一口气，然后说：“嗨，亲爱的，昨天夜里我做了一个梦。我梦见老上帝死掉了，所有的安琪儿都陪送他走进了坟墓！” “你怎么能想出、而且相信这样荒唐的事情呢？”丈夫说。“你还不知道，上帝是永不会死的吗？” 这个善良的妻子的脸上露出了快乐的光芒。她热情地握着丈夫的双手，大声说：“那么老上帝还活着！” “当然活着！”丈夫回答说，“你怎能怀疑这件事呢？” 于是她拥抱他，朝他和蔼的眼睛里望——那双眼睛里充满了信任、和平和愉快的光。她说：“不过，亲爱的，假如老上帝还活着，那么我们为什么不相信他，不依赖他呢？ 他数过我们头上的每一根头发；如果我们落掉一根，他是没有不知道的。他叫田野上长出百合花，他让麻雀有食物吃，让乌鸦有东西抓！” 听完了这番话以后，丈夫就似乎觉得蒙着他的眼睛的那层云翳现在被揭开了，束着他的心的那根绳子被松开了。好久以来他第一次笑了。他明白了他虔诚的、亲爱的妻子对他所用的这个聪明的计策：这个办法使他恢复了他所失去的对上帝的信心，使他重新有了依靠。 射进这房子里的阳光现在更和蔼地照到这对善良的人的脸上，熏风更凉爽地拂着他们面颊上的笑容，小鸟儿更高声地唱出对上帝的感谢之歌。 这篇小品最初发表在1836年11月 18日出版的《丹麦大众报》上。“国内的生活费用很高，粮食的供应又不足，捐税不断地在加重；屋子里的资产在一年一年地减少。最后，这里已经没有什么东西了，只剩下穷困和悲哀。”普通百姓处于水深火热之中，善良的安徒生对此毫无办法，只有求助于“上帝”。这篇作品反映出安徒生性格中天真而又诚挚的一面。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881/1207.html","bookId":674,"book":{"id":674,"title":"安徒生童话全集","description":"简介： 汉斯克里斯蒂安安徒生（Hans Christian Andersen，1805年4月2日－1875年8月4日）丹麦作家，诗人，因为他的童话故事而世界闻名。他最著名的童话故事有《小锡兵》、《冰雪女王》、《拇指姑...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201402/25/14-30-17-86-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
