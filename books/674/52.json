{"id":28060,"no":52,"title":"THE PHOENIX BIRD","content":"IN the Garden of Paradise, beneath the Tree of Knowledge, bloomed a rose bush. Here, in the first rose, a bird was born: his flight was like the flashing of light, his plumage was beauteous, and his song ravishing.\n But when Eve plucked the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, when she and Adam were driven from Paradise, there fell from the flaming sword of the cherub a spark into the nest of the bird, which blazed up forthwith. The bird perished in the flames; but from the red egg in the nest there fluttered aloft a new one----the one solitary Phoenix bird. The fable tells us that he dwells in Arabia, and that every hundred years he burns himself to death in his nest; but each time a new Phoenix, the only one in the world, rises up from the red egg.\n The bird flutters round us, swift as light, beauteous in colour, charming in song. When a mother sits by her infant\u0027s cradle, he stands on the pillow, and, with his wings, forms a glory around the infant\u0027s head. He flies through the chamber of content, and brings sunshine into it, and the violets on the humble table smell doubly sweet.\n But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone. He wings his way in the glimmer of the Northern Lights over the icy plains of Lapland, and hops among the yellow flowers in the short Greenland summer. Beneath the copper mountains of Fahlun and in England\u0027s coal mines, he flies, in the shape of a dusty moth, over the hymn-book that rests on the knees of the pious miner. On a lotus leaf he floats down the sacred waters of the Ganges, and the eye of the Hindoo maid gleams bright when she beholds him.\n The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him?\n The Bird of Paradise, the holy swan of song! On the car of Thespis he sat in the guise of a chattering raven,and flapped his black wings, smeared with the lees of wine; over the sounding harp of Iceland swept the swan\u0027s red beak; on Shakespeare\u0027s shoulder he sat in the guise of Odin\u0027s raven, and whispered in his ear“Immortality!” and at the minstrels\u0027 feast he fluttered through the halls of the Wartburg.\n The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? He sang to thee the Marseillaise, and thou kissedst the feather that fell from his wing; he came in the radiance of Paradise, and perchance thou didst turn away from him towards the sparrow who sat with tinsel on his wings.\n The Bird of Paradise----renewed each century----born in flame, ending in flame! Thy picture, in a golden frame,hangs in the halls of the rich, but thou thyself often fliest around, lonely and disregarded, a myth----“The Phoenix of Arabia.”\n In Paradise, when thou wert born in the first rose, beneath the Tree of Knowledge, thou receivedst a kiss, and thy right name was given thee----thy name, oerry.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881/1039.html","bookId":674,"book":{"id":674,"title":"安徒生童话全集","description":"简介： 汉斯克里斯蒂安安徒生（Hans Christian Andersen，1805年4月2日－1875年8月4日）丹麦作家，诗人，因为他的童话故事而世界闻名。他最著名的童话故事有《小锡兵》、《冰雪女王》、《拇指姑...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201402/25/14-30-17-86-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
