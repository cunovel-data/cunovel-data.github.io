{"id":28083,"no":75,"title":"IB AND CHRISTINE","content":"NOT far from the stream Gudenaa，in the forest of Silkeborg，a great ridge of land rises and stretches along like a wall．By this ridge，westward，stands a farm-house，surrounded by poor land；the sandy soil is seen through the spare rye and wheat that grow upon it．Some years have elapsed since the time of which we speak．The people who lived here cultivated the fields，and moreover kept three sheep，a pig，and two oxen；in fact，they sup-ported themselves quite comfortably，for they had enough to live on if they took things as they came Indeed，they could have managed to save enough to keep two horses；but，like the other peasants of the neighbourhood，they said，“The horse eats itself up”-that is to say，it eats as much as it earns．Jeppe-Jens cultivated his field in summer．In the winter he made wooden shoes，and then he had an assistant，a journeyman，who understood how to make the wooden shoes strong，and light，and graceful．They carved shoes and spoons，and that brought in money．It would have been wronging the Jeppe-Jenses to call them poor people．\n Little Ib，a boy seven years old，the only child of the family，would sit by，looking at the workmen，cutting at a stick，and occasionally cutting his finger． But one day he had out two pieces of wood，so that they looked like little wooden shoes；and these he wanted to give to little Christine．was the boatman\u0027s daughter，and was graceful and delicate as a gentleman\u0027s child；had she been differently dressed，no one would have imagined that she came out of the hut on the neighbouring heath．There lived her father，who was a widower，and supported him-self by carrying firewood in his great out of the forest down to the eel-weir of Silkeborg，and sometimes even to the distant town of Randers．He had no one who could take care of little Christine，who was a year younger than Ib，and therefore the child was almost always with him in his boat，or in the forest among the heath plants and barberry bushes．When he had to go as far as Randers，he would bring little Christine to stay at the Jeppe-Jenses’．\n Ib and Christine agreed very well in every particular：they dug in the ground together for treasures，and they ran and crept，and one day they ventured together up the high ridge，and a long way into the forest；they found a few snipe\u0027s eggs there，and that was a great event for them．\n Ib had never been on the heath，nor had he ever been on the river．But even this was to happen；for Christine\u0027s father once invited him to go with them，and on the evening before the excursion，Ib went home with him．\n Next morning early，the two children were sitting high up on the pile of firewood in the boat，eating bread and raspberries．Christine\u0027s father and his assistant propelled the boat with staves．They had the current with them，and swiftly they glided down the stream，through the lakes which sometimes seemed shut in by woods and reeds．But there was always room for them to pass，even if the old trees bent quite forward over the water，and the old oaks bent down their bare branches，as if they had turned up their sleeves，and wanted to show their knotty naked arms．Old alder trees，which the stream had washed away from the bank，clung with their roots to the bottom of the stream，and looked like little wooded islands．The water-lilies rocked themselves on the river．It was a splendid excursion；and at last they came to the great eel-weir，where the water rushed through the flood-gates；that was some-thing for Ib and Christine to see！\n In those days there was no manufactory there，nor was there any，town：only the old farm-yard，and the stock there was not large；and the rushing of the water through the weir and the cry of the wild ducks were the only signs of life in Silkeborg．After the firewood had been unloaded，the father of Christine bought a whole bundle of eels and a slaughtered sucking-pig，and all was put into a basket and placed in the stern of the boat．Then they went back again up the stream；but the wind was favourable，and when the sails were hoisted It was as good as if two horses had been harnessed to the boat．\n When they had arrived at a point in the stream where the assistant-boatman dwelt，a little way from the bank，the boat was moored，and the two men landed，after exhorting the children to sit still．But the children did not do that very long．They must be peeping into the bas-ket in which the eels and the sucking-pig had been placed，and they must need pull the sucking-pig out，and take it in their hands；and as both wanted to hold it at the same time，it came to pass that they let it fall into the water，and the sucking-pig drifted away with the stream-and here was a terrible event！\n Ib jumped ashore，and ran a little distance along the bank，and Christine sprang after him．\n “Take me with you！”she cried．\n And in a few minutes they were deep in the thicket，and could no longer see either the boat or the bank．They ran on a little farther，and then Christine fell down on the ground and began to cry；but Ib picked her up．\n “Follow me！”he cried．“The house lies over there．”\n But the house was not there．They wandered on and on，over the withered leaves，and over dry fallen branch-Es that crackled beneath their feet．Soon thet heard a loud piercing scream．They stood still and listened，and presently the scream of an eagle again sounded through the wood．It was an ugly scream，and they were frightened at it；but before them，in the thick wood，the most beautiful blueberries grew in wonderful profusion．They were so inviting that the children could not do otherwise than stop；and they lingered for some time，eating the blueberries till they had quite blue mouths and blue cheeks．Now again they heart the cry they had heard be-fore．\n “We shall get into trouble about the pig，”said Christine．\n “Come，let us go to our house， said Ib；“It is here in the wood．”\n And they went forward．They presently came to a road，but it did not lead them home；and darkness came on，and they were afraid．The wonderful stillness that reigned around was interrupted now and then by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and of the birds that were strange to them．At last they both lost themselves in a thicket．Christine cried，and Ib cried too；and after they had cried for a time，they threw themselves down on the dry leaves，and went fast asleep．\n The sun was high in the heavens when the two children awoke．They were cold；but on the hillock close at hand the sun shone through the trees and there they thought they would warm themselves；and from there Ib fancied they would be able to see his parents’ house．But they were far away from that，in quite another part of the forest．They clambered to the top of the rising ground，and found themselves on the summit of a slope running down to the margin of a transparent lake．They could see fish in great numbers in the pure water illumined by the sun\u0027s rays．This spectacle was quite a sudden surprise for them；close beside them grew a nut tree covered with the finest nuts；and now they picked the nuts and cracked them，and ate the delicate young kernels，which had only just begun to form．But there was another surprise and another fright in store for them．Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman：her face was quite brown，and her hair was deep black and shining．The whites of her eyes gleamed like a negro\u0027s；on her back she carried a bundle， and in her hand she bore a knotted stick．She was a gipsy．The children did not at once nuderstand what she said．She brought three nuts out of her pocket，and told them that in these nuts the most beautiful，the loveliest things were hidden，for they were wishing-nuts．\n Ib looked at her，and she seemed so friendly that he plucked up courage and asked her if she would give him the nuts；and the woman gave them to him，and gathered some more for herself，a whole pocketful，from the nut tree．\n And Ib and Christine looked at the wishing-nuts with great eyes．\n “Is there a carriage with a pair of horses in this nutt？”he asked．\n “Yes，there\u0027s a golden carriage with golden horses，”answered the woman．\n “Then give me the nut，”said little Christine．\n And Ib gave it to her，and the strange woman tied it in her pocket-handkerchief for her．\n {ewc MVIMAGE,MVIMAGE, !413549T1.bmp}\n “Is there in this nut a pretty little neckerchief，like the one Christine wears round her neck？”inquired Ib． “There are ten neckerchiefs in it，”answered the woman．“There are beautiful dresses in it，and stockings，and a hat．” “Then I will have that one too，”cried little Chris-tine．\n And Ib gave her the second nut also．The third was a little black thing．\n “That one you can keep，”said Christine；“and it is a pretty one too”\n “What is in it？”inquired Ib．\n “The best of all things for you，”replied the gipsy woman．\n And Ib held the nut very tight．The woman promised to lead the children into the right path，so that they might find their way home；and now they went forward；certainly in quite a different direction from the path they should have followed．But that is no reason why we should suspect the gipsy woman of wanting to steal the children．In the wild wood-path they met the torest bailiff，who knew Ib；and by his help，Ib and Christine both arrived at home，where their friends had been very anxious about them．They were pardoned and forgiven，although they had indeed both de-served to get into trouble；firstly，because they had let the sucking-pig fall into the water，and secondly，because they had run away．\n Christine was taken back to her father on the heath，and Ib remained in the farm-house by the wood．The first thing he did in the evening was to bring forth out of his pocket the nut，in which“the best thing of all”was said to be enclosed．He placed it carefully between the door and the door-frame，and then shut the door so as to break the nut；but there was not much kernel in it．The nut looked as if it were filled with snuff or black rich earth；it was what we call hollow，or worm-eaten．\n “Yes，that\u0027s exactly what I thought，”said Ib．“How could the very best thing be contained in this little nut？And Christine will get just as little out of her two nuts，and will have neither fine clothes nor golden carriage．”\n And winter came on，and the new year began；indeed，several years went by．\n Ib was now to be confirmed，and the clergyman lived a long way off．About tiis time the boatman one day visited Ib\u0027s parents，and told them that Christine was now going into service，and that she had been really fortunate in getting a remarkably good place，and falling into worthy hands．\n “Only think！”he said；“she is going to the rich innkeeper\u0027s，in the inn at Herning，far towards the west．She is to assist the hostess in keeping the house；and afterwards，if she takes to it well，and stays to be con-firmed there，the people are going to keep her with them．\n And Ib and Christine took leave of one another．People called them sweethearts；and at parting，the girl showed Ib that she had still the two nuts which he had given her long ago，during their wanderings in the forest；and she told him，moreover，that in a drawer she had carefully kept the little wooden shoes which he had carved as a present for her in their childish days．And thereupon they parted．\n Ib was confirmed．But he remained in his mother\u0027s house，for he had become a clever maker of wooden shoes，and in summer he looked after the field．His mother had no one else to do this，for his father was dead．\n Only seldom he got news of Christine from some passing postilion or eel-fisher．But she was well off at the rich innkeeper\u0027s；and after she had been confirmed，she wrote a letter to her father，and sent a kind message to Ib and his mother；and in the letter there was mention made of six new shifts and a fine new gown，which Christine had received from her master and mistress．This was certainly good news．\n Next spring，there was a knock one warm day at the door of our Ib\u0027s old mother，and behold，the boatman and Christine stepped into the room．She had come on a visit to spend a day：a carriage had to come from the Heming Inn to the next village，and she had taken the opportunity to see her friends once again．She looked as handsome as a real lady，and she had a pretty gown on，which had been well sewn，and made expressly for her．There she stood，in grand array，and Ib was in his working clothes．He could not utter a word：he certainly seized her hand，and held it fast in his own，and was heartily glad；but he could not get his tongue to obey him．Christine was not embarrassed，however，for she went on talking and talking，and，moreover，kissed Ib on his mouth in the heartiest manner．\n “Do you really not know me？”she asked；but even afterwards，when they were left quite by themselves，and he stood there still holding her hand in his，he could only sar，\n “You look quite like a real lady，and I am so uncouth．How often I have thought of you，Christine，and of the old times！”\n And arm in arm they sauntered up the great ridge，and looked across the stream towards the heath，towards the great heather banks．It was perfectly silent；but by the time they parted it had grown quite clear to him that Chris-tine must be his wife．Had they not，even in their child-hood，been called sweethearts？To him they seemed to be really engaged to each other，though neither of them had spoken a word on the subject．Only for a few more hours could they remain together，for Christine was obliged to go back into the next village，from whence the carriage was to start early next morning for Herning．Her father and Ib Escorted her as far as the village．It was a fair moonlight evening，and when they reached their destination，and Ib still held Christine\u0027s hand in his own，he could not let it go．His eyes brightened，but still the words came halting over his lips．Yet they came from the depths of his heart，when he said，\n If you have not become too grand，Christine，and if you can make up your mind to live with me in my mother\u0027s house as my wife，we must become a wedded pair some day；but we can wait a while yet．”\n “Yes，let us wait for a time，Ib，” she replied；and she pressed his hand，and he kissed her lips．“I trust in you，Ib，”said Christine；“and I think that I love you-but I will sleep upon it．”\n And with that they parted．And on the way home Ib told the boatman that he and Christine were as good as betrothed；and the boatman declared he had always expected it would turn out so；and he went home with Ib，and remained that night in the young man\u0027s house；but nothing further was said of the betrothal．\n A year passed by，in the course of which two letters were exchanged between Ib and Christine．The signature was prefaced by the words，“Faithful till death！”One day the boatman came in to Ib，and brought him a greeting from Christine．What he had further to say was brought out in somewhat hesitating，but it was to the effect that Christine was almost more than prosperous，for she was a pretty girl，courted and loved．The son of the host had been home on a visit；he was employed in the office of some great institution in Copenhagen；and he was very much pleased with Christine，and she had taken a fancy to him：his parents were not unwilling，but it lay very much on Christine\u0027s mind that Ib had such a fancy for her；“and so she had thought of fusing this great piece of good fortune，”said the boatman．\n At first Ib said not a word，but he became as white as a sheet，and slightly shook his head．The he said slowly，\n “Christine must not thrust her good fortune away．”\n “Then do you write a few words to her，”said the boatman．\n And Ib sat down to write；but he could not manage it well：the words would not come as he wished them；and first he altered，and then he tore up the page；but the next morning a letter lay ready to be sent to Christine，and here it is：\n I hare read the letter you hare sent to your father，and gather from it that you are prospering in all things，and that there is a prospect of higher fortune for you．Ask your heart，Christine，and think well over what you are going into，if you take me for your husband；what I possess is but little．Do not think of me，or my position，but think of your own welfare．You are bound to me by no promise，and if in your heart you have given me one，I．release you from it．May all the joy of the world be yours，Christine．Heaven will have comfort for my heart．\n Ever your sincere friend，IB．\n And the letter was dispatched，and Christine duly received it．\n In the course of that November her banns were published in the church on the heath，and in Copenhagen，where her bridegroom lived；and to Copenhagen she travelled，with her mistress，because the bridegroom could not undertake the journey into Jutland on account of his various occupations．On the journey，Christine met her father in a certain village，and here the two took leave of one another．A few words were mentioned concerning this fact，but Ib made no remark upon it：his mother said he had grown very silent of late；indeed，he had become very pensive，and thus the three nuts came into his mind which the gipsy woman had given him long ago，and of which he had given two to Christine．Yes，it seemed right-in one of hers lay a golden carriage with horses，and in the other very elegant clothes；all those luxuries would now be Christine\u0027s in the capital．Her part had thus come true．And to him，Ib，the nut had offered only black earth．The gipsy woman had said this was“the best of all for him”．Yes，it was night—that also was coming true．The black earth was the best for him．Now he understood clearly what had been the woman\u0027s meaning．In the black earth，in the dark grave，would be the best happiness for him．\n And once again years passed by，not very many，but they seemed long years to Ib．The old innkeeper and his wife died，and the whole of their property，many thousands of dollars，came to the son．Yes，now Christine could have the golden carriage and plenty of fine clothes．\n During the two long years that followed，no letter came from Christine；and when her father at length received one from her，it was not written in prosperity，by any means．Poor Christine！neither she nor her husband had understood how to keep the money together，and there seemed to be no blessimg with it，because they had not sought it．\n And again the heather bloomed and faded．The snow had swept for many winters across the heath，and over the ridge beneath which Ib dwelt，sheltered from the rough winds．The spring sun shone bright，and Ib guided the plough across his field，when one day it glided over what appeared to be a flint stone．Something like a great black shaving came out of the ground，and when Ib took it up it proved to be a piece of metal；and where the plough had cut into it，it gleamed brightly．It was a great heavy arm-let of gold from heathen times．A grave-mound bad been levelled here and its precious treasure found．Ib showed what he had found to the clergyman，who explained its value to him，and then he betook himself to the local judge，who reported the discovery to Copenhagen，and recommended Ib to deliver up the treasure in person．\n “You have found in the earth the best thing you could find，” said the judge．\n “The best thing！”thought Ib．“The very best thing for me，and found in the earth！Well，if that is the best，the gipsy woman was correct in what she prophesied to me．\n So Ib travelled with the boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen．To him，who had only crossed Gudenaa，it was like a voyage across the ocean．And he arrived in Copenhagen．\n The value of the gold he had found was paid over to him；it was a large sum-six hundred dollars．And Ib of the heath wandered about in the great capital．\n On the day on which he had settled to go back with the captain，Ib lost his way in the streets，and took quite a different direction from the one he intended to follow．He had wandered into the suburb of Christianshaven，into a poor little street．Not a human being was to be seen．At last a very little girl came out of a wretched house．Ib inquired of the little one the way to the street which he wanted；but she looked shyly at him，and began to cry bitterly．He asked her what ailed her，but could not understand what she said in reply．But as they were both under a lamp，and the light fell on the girl\u0027s face，he felt quite strange，for Christine stood bodily before him，just as he remembered her from the days of his childhood．\n And he went with the little maiden into the wretched house，and ascended the narrow，crazy staircase，which led to a little attic chamber in the roof．The air in this chamber was heavy and almost suffocating：no light was burning；but there was heavy sighing，and moaning in one corner．Ib struck a light with the help of a match．It was the mother of the child who lay on the miserable bed．\n “Can I be of any service to you？”asked Ib．“This little girl has brought me up here，but I am a stranger in this city．Are there no neighbours or friends whom I could call to you？And he raised the sick woman\u0027s head．\n It was Christine of the heath！\n For years her name had not been mentioned at home in Jutland，for it would have disturbed Ib\u0027s peace of mind，and rumour had told nothing good concerning her．The wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant．He had given up his certain appointment，had travelled for half a year in foreign lands，and on his return had incurred debts，and yet lived in an expensive fashion．His carriage had bent over more and more，so to speak，until at last it turned over commapletely．The many merry companions and table-friends he had entertained declared it served him right，for he had kept house like a madman；and one morning his body was found in the canal．\n The hand of death was already on Christine．Her youngest child，only a few weeks old，expected in prosperity and born in misery，was alresdy in its grave，and it had come to this with Christine herself，that she lay sick to death and forsaken，in a miserable room，amid a poverty that she might well have borne in her childish days，but which now oppressed her painfully，since she had been accustomed to better things．It was her eldest child，also a little Christine，that here suffered hunger and poverty with her，and who had conducted Ib there．\n “I am afraid I shall die and leave the poor child here alone，”she said．“Where in the world will she go then？”And not a word more could she utter．\n And Ib brought out another match，and lighted up a piece of candle he found in the room，and the flame illumined the wretched dwelling．\n And Ib looked at the little girl，and thought how Christine had looked when she was young；and he felt that for her sake he would be good to this child，which was as yet a stranger to him．The dying woman gazed at him，and her eyes opened wider and wider—did she recognize him？He never knew，for no further word passed over her lips．\n And it was in the forest by the river Gudenaa，in the region of the heath．The air was grey，and there were no blossoms on the heath plant；but the autumn tempests whirled the yellow leaves from the wood into the stream，and out over the heath towards the hut of the boatman，in which strangers now dwelt；but beneath the ridge，safe beneath the protection of the high trees，stood the little farm，trimly whitewashed and painted，and within it the turf blazed up cheerily in the chimney；for within was sunlight，the beaming sunlight of a child\u0027s two eyes；and the tones of the spring birds sounded in the words that came from the child\u0027s rosy lips：she sat on Ib\u0027s knee，and Ib was to her both father and mother，for her own parents were dead，and had vanished from her as a dream vanishes alike from children and grown men．Ib sat in the pretty neat house，for he was a prosperous man，while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at Copenhagen，where she had died in poverty．\n Ib had money，and was said to have provided for the future．He had won gold out of the black earth，and he had a Christine for his own，after all．\n 依卜、和小克丽斯玎\n \n 离古德诺河不远，在西尔克堡森林里面，有一道土丘从地面上凸出来了，像一堵墙一样伸展开去。[人们管它叫“背脊”]。在这高地下面朝西一点有一间小小的农舍，它的周围全是贫瘠的土地；在那稀疏的燕麦和小麦中间，隐隐地现出了沙子。\n 现在许多年已经过去了。住在这儿的人耕种着他们的一点儿田地，还养了三头羊、一头猪和两头公牛。实际上，他们过得很舒服，只要他们满足于自己所有的东西，他们的食物可以说够吃的。的确，他们还可以节省点钱买两匹马：可是，像附近一带别的农人一样，他们说，“马儿把自己吃光了”——它们能生产多少，就吃掉多少。\n 耶布·演斯在夏天耕他的那点地。在冬天他就[成了一个能干的]做木鞋[的人]。他还有一个助手——一个短工，这人知道怎样把木鞋做得结实、轻巧和漂亮。他们雕出木鞋和勺子，而这些东西都能赚钱。所以人们不能把耶布·演斯这一家人叫做穷人。\n 小小的依卜是一个7岁的男孩子，是这家的独生子。他常常坐在旁边，看别人削着木头，也削着自己的指头。不过有一天他刻好了两块木头，刻得像一双小木鞋的样子。他说要把它们送给小克丽斯玎。她是一个船夫的女儿，长得很秀气和娇嫩，像一位绅士的孩子。如果她的衣服配得上她的样子，那么谁也不会以为她就是附近荒地上茅屋里的一个孩子。她的父亲住在那儿。他的妻子已经死了。他生活的来源是靠用他的大船装运柴火，从森林里运到西尔克堡的鳝鱼堰，有时也从这儿运到较远的兰得尔斯。没有什么人来照料比依卜只小一岁的克丽斯玎，因此这孩子就老是跟他一起在船里，在森林里欧石南丛生的荒地上，或在伏牛花灌木丛里玩耍，当他要到像兰得尔斯那么远的地方去的时候，小小的克丽斯玎就到耶布·演斯家里去。\n 依卜和克丽斯玎[在一起玩，一起吃饭，]非常要好：他们一起掘土和挖土，他们爬着，跑着。有一天他们居然大胆地跑到“背脊”上，走进一个树林里去了。他们甚至还找到了几个沙锥鸟蛋——这真是一桩了不起的事情。\n 依卜从来没有到荒地上去过；他也从来没有乘过船[在古登诺沿岸的小湖上航行]。现在他要做这事情了：克丽斯玎的父亲请他去，在出游的头天晚上，带依卜到家里去住。\n 第二天大清早，这两个孩子高高地坐在船上的一堆木柴上，吃着面包和山莓。船夫和他的助手撑着船。船是顺着水在河上航行，穿过这些平时好像是被树木和芦苇封锁住了的湖泊，而且行走得很快。即使有许多老树在水面上垂得很低，他们仍然可以找到空处滑过去。许多老栎树垂下光赤的枝桠，好像卷起了袖子，要把节节疤疤的光手臂露出来似的。许多老赤杨树被水流冲击着；树根紧紧抓住河底不放，看起来就像长满了树木的小岛。睡莲在河中摇动着。这真是一趟可爱的旅行！最后他们来到了鳝鱼堰。水在这儿从水闸里冲出去。这才是一件值得依卜和克丽斯玎看的东西哩！\n 在那个时候，这儿没有什么工厂，也没有什么城镇。这儿只有一个老农庄，里面养的家畜也不多，水冲出闸口的声音和野鸭的叫声，算是西尔克堡唯一有生物存在的标记。木柴卸下来以后，克丽斯玎的父亲就买了整整一捆鳝鱼和一只杀好了的小猪。他把这些东西都装在一个篮子里，放到船尾上。然后就逆流而上，往回走，但是他们却遇到了顺风。当船帆一张起来的时候，这船就好像有两匹马在拉着似的。\n 他们来到那个助手领着住的地方时，就把船靠了岸，那地方离河岸只有一小段路。助手领着克丽斯玎的父亲走到岸上去，同时叫孩子们不要闹，当心出乱子。不过这两个孩子听话并没有多久。他们想看看篮子里装着的鳝鱼和那只小猪。他们把那只小猪拖出来，抱在怀里。当他们两个人抢着要抱它的时候，却失手掉进水里去了。于是这只小猪就顺流而下——这才可怕啦。\n 依卜跳到岸上去，在岸上跑了一段路；小克丽斯玎在后面跟着他跑。\n “带着我一道呀！”她喊着。\n 不一会儿，他们就跑进一个树林的深处去了。他们再也看不到船，也看不到河岸。他们更向前跑了一段路。克丽斯玎跌到地上，开始哭起来。依卜把她扶起来。\n “跟着我来吧！”他说。“屋子就在那儿。”\n 但是屋子并不在那儿。他们无目的地走着，在枯叶上走，在落下的干枯的枝子上走——这些枝子在他们的小脚下发出碎裂的声音。这时他们听到了一个尖锐的叫声，他们站着静听，立刻就听到一只苍鹰的尖叫声。这是一种难听的声音，使他们非常害怕。不过在这浓密的树林中，他们看到面前长满了非常可爱的越橘，数量真是不少。这实在太吸引人了，他们不得不停下来，于是就停下来，吃了许多，把嘴唇和脸都染青了。这时 他们又听到了那个尖叫声。\n “那只猪丢了，我们要挨打的！”克丽斯玎说。\n “我们回到家里去吧！”依卜说。“家就在这树林里呀。”\n 于是他们便向前走。他们来到了一条大路上，但是这条路并不通到家。夜幕也降下来了，他们害怕起来。有角的猫头鹰的怪叫声和其他不知名的鸟儿的声音，把周围一片奇怪的静寂打破了。最后他们两人在一个灌木林边停下来。克丽斯玎哭起来，依卜也哭起来。他们哭了一阵以后，就在干叶子上倒下来，睡熟了。\n 当这两个小孩子醒来的时候，太阳已经爬得很高了。他们感到很冷。不过在旁边一个小山上的树林里，已经有太阳光射进来。他们觉得可以到那儿去暖和一下。依卜还以为从那儿他们就可以看到他爸爸的屋子。然而事实上他们却是离得非常远，相隔整个树林。\n 他们向小山顶上爬去。他们站在一个斜坡上，旁边有一个清亮的、透明的湖。鱼儿在成群地游，太阳光把它们照得发亮。他们从来没有看到过这样的景象。在他们的近旁有一个大灌木林，上面结满了极好的榛子。[甚至还有7扎成串的榛子。]他们把榛子摘下来敲碎、挖出里面细嫩的、刚刚长成形的核仁。不过另外还有一件惊人可怕的事情发生了。\n 从这丛林里面，走出了一个高大的老女人：她的面孔是棕色的；头发乌黑，并且发着光；白眼珠闪亮着，像非洲摩尔人的白眼珠一样。她背着一捆东西，手上拿着一根有许多疙瘩的棍子。她是一个吉卜赛人。这两个孩子不能马上听懂她讲的话。她从衣袋里取出三颗榛子，告诉他们说，这些榛子里藏着最美丽又最可爱的东西，因为它们是希望之果。\n 依卜望着她。她是非常和善的。所以他就鼓起勇气，问她能不能把这些果子给他。这女人给了他，然后又从树上摘了一些，装了满满的一袋。\n 依卜和克丽斯玎睁着大眼睛，望着这希望之果。\n “这果子里有一辆两匹马拉的车子没有？”依卜问。\n “有，有一辆金马拉的金车子。”女人回答说。\n “那么就请把这果子给我吧！”小克丽斯玎说。\n 依卜把果子给她，这女人就替她把果子包在她的小手帕里面。\n “这果子里面有一块像克丽斯玎那样的美丽的小围巾吗？”依卜问。\n “那里面有10块围巾，”女人回答说；“还有美丽的衣服。袜子和帽子。”\n “那么这只果子我也要，”小克丽斯玎说。\n 于是依卜把第二个果子也给了她。第三个是一个小小的黑东西。\n “你把这个自己留下吧！”克丽斯玎说。“它也是很可爱的。”\n “它里面有什么东西呢？”依卜问。\n “你所喜欢的最好的东西，”吉卜赛女人说。\n 依卜紧紧地握着这果子。女人答应把他们领到回家的正确的路上去。现在他们向前走，但是恰恰走到和正路相反的方向去了。我们可不能说她想拐走这两个孩子啊。在这荒野的山路上，他们遇到了守山人。他认得依卜。靠了他的帮助，依卜和克丽斯玎终于回到家里来了。家里的人正在为他们担忧。他们终于得到了宽恕，虽然他们应该结结实实地挨一顿打才对：因为第一，他们把那只小猪掉到水里去了；第二，他们溜走了。\n 克丽斯玎回到荒地上的家里去；依卜依旧住在树林边的那个农庄里。晚间他要做的第一件事，就是从衣袋里取出那个果子——据说里面藏着“最好的东西”。他小心地把它放在门和门框中间，使劲地把门关一下，果子便被轧碎了。可是里面一点核仁也没有。只有一堆好像鼻烟或者黑色的沃土似的东西——这就是我们所谓虫蛀了的果子。\n “是的，这跟我所想到的恰恰差不离，”依卜说。“这么一个小果子里怎么能装得下世界上最好的东西呢？克丽斯玎也不会在她的两个果子里找到美丽的衣服或金车子！”\n 冬天到来了，新年也开始了。\n 好几年过去了。\n 依卜现在要受坚信礼了，而他住的地方却离开牧师很远。在这期间，有一天，那个船夫来看依卜的爸爸和妈妈，告诉他们说，克丽斯玎现在快要去帮人做活了；还说她真是运气，在一个非常好的主人家里找到了一个很不错的职业。“请想想看吧！”他说，“她将要到西部赫尔宁县去帮一个有钱的旅店老板。她先帮助女主人照料旅店。如果她做得好，一直做到受坚信礼的时候，主人就可以把她留下来。”\n 于是依卜和克丽斯玎就互相道别了。大家把他们叫做一对情人。在分手的时候，她拿给他看，她还保存着那两颗果子。这是当他们在树林里迷路的时候他送给她的。她还告诉他说，他在儿时亲手雕成、作为礼物送给她的那双木鞋，她仍然保存在抽屉里，接着他们就分手了。\n 依卜受了坚信礼，但是他仍然住在母亲的屋子里，因为他已经是一个能干的木鞋匠，同时在夏天他也可以照顾田里的工作。他的母亲找不到别人做这些事情，因为他的父亲已经死了。\n 他只有偶尔从路过的送信人或捉鳝鱼的人口中听到一点关于克丽斯玎的消息：她在那个富有的店老板家里生活得很好。她受了坚信礼以后，曾经写过一封信给她的父亲，同时也问候了依卜和他的母亲，信里还提到她从她的男主人和女主人那里得到了6件衬衫和一件新衣。这的确是一个好消息。\n 在第二年春天一个暖和的日子里，依卜和老母亲听到一阵敲门声，那个船夫和克丽斯玎 走进门来。她要来玩一整天。赫尔宁旅店的一辆马车要到这儿邻近的村庄去，她是利用这个机会来拜访朋友们的。她长得很漂亮，简直像一位小姐；她穿着美丽的衣服——做得很好，恰恰适合她的身材。她站在他面前，非常大方；而依卜却只穿着平时的工作服。他一句话也讲不出来；当然啦，他握着她的手，握得很紧，而且衷心地感到快乐；不过他没有办法讲出话来。克丽斯玎倒是一点也不感到拘束；她谈着话——她才会讲呢。她还非常热情地在依卜的嘴唇上吻了一下。\n “你真的不认识我吗？”她问。不过甚至在后来，当只有他们两人在屋子里的时候，他仍然只是握着她的手站着。他只能说出这几句话：\n “你真像一位小姐！但我是这么粗笨。我多么想念你啊，克丽斯玎！多么想念过去的日子啊！”\n 他们手挽着手走到那个山脊上，朝那条河、那荒地和那长满了石南属植物的两岸眺望。但是依卜一句话也不说，但是当他们快要分手的时候，他十分清楚地觉得克丽斯玎应该成为他的妻子。的确，他们在小时候就被人称为一对情人。他觉得仿佛他们真正订过婚似的，虽然他们谁也没有谈起这事情。\n 他们现在只有几小时可以在一起了，因为克丽斯玎要到邻近的村子去，以便第二天大清早搭车子回到赫尔宁去。她的父亲和依卜一 直把她送到邻近的村子去。这是一个晴朗的月夜。当他们到了终点的时候，依卜仍然握着克丽斯玎的手，简直松不开。他的眼睛闪着光，但是话语来到嘴唇边就缩回去了。当他终于说出来的时候，那完全是从他心的深处说出来的话，“克丽斯玎，如果你没有变得那么阔气，”他说，“如果你能住在我母亲家里，作为我的妻子，那么我们两人就有一天会正式结为夫妇的。不过我们还可以等一些时候！”\n “是的，我们等些时候看吧，依卜！”她说。于是她就握了他的手；他也吻了她的嘴唇。“我相信你，依卜。”克丽斯玎说；“同时我想我也喜欢你——但是我得想一想！”\n 于是他们就分了手。在回家的路上，依卜告诉船夫说，他和克丽斯玎是那么要好，简直像是订过婚一样。于是船夫就说，他一直希望有这样的结果。他和依卜一起回到家来；这天晚上他和这个年轻人睡在一起，他们已经不再讨论订婚问题了。\n 一年过去了。依卜和克丽斯玎通过两封信。在他们签名的前面，总是写着这几个字： “永远忠诚，一直到死！” 有一天船夫来看依卜，转达克丽斯玎的问候。他接着要说的话，却是颇有点吞吞吐吐的，但是它的内容不外是：克丽斯玎一切都好，不仅仅好，而且还成了一个美丽的姑娘，有许多人追求她，有许多人爱她。主人的少爷曾经回家住过些时候。他在哥本哈根一个很大的机关里工作；他非常喜欢克丽斯玎，而她对他也发生了感情，他的父母也并没有表示不愿意；不过克丽斯玎的心里觉得非常沉重，因为依卜曾经那么爱她；“因此她也想过，要放弃她的这种幸运，”——这是船夫说的话。\n 起初依卜一句话也不说，但是他的面色却像白布一样惨白。他轻轻地摇了摇头，然后慢慢地说：“克丽斯玎不应该放弃她的幸运！”\n “那么就请你写几句话给她吧！”船夫说。\n 依卜于是就坐下来写，不过出乎他意料之外，他不能把自己心里想说的话联成句子。他开始涂涂改改，然后把整张纸撕掉了。不过到第二天早晨，信终于写好了，准备送给克丽斯玎。全文是这样的：\n 你给你父亲的信我也读到了。从信中我知道你的一切都好，而且还会更好。克丽斯玎，请你扪心自问，同时仔细地想一想，如果你接受我做你的丈夫，你将会得到什么结果：我实在是太寒碜了。请你不要为我和我的处境着想，而要为你自己的利益着想。你对我没有任何诺言的约束。如果你在心里曾经对我许过诺言，我愿意为你解除这个负担。愿世上一切的快乐都属于你，克丽斯玎，上帝将会安慰我的心！\n 你永远忠实的朋友 依卜\n 这封信送出去了，克丽斯玎也收到了。\n 在11月里，她的结婚预告在荒地上的那个教堂里，和在新郎所住的哥本哈根同时发表出来了。于是她便跟她的女主人一起旅行到哥本哈根去，因为新郎有许多事情要办，不能回到遥远的尤兰来。克丽斯玎在途中要经过一个小镇[芬德尔]，她在这儿会见了她的父亲。[这是离他最近的一个地点。]他们在这里互相告别。\n 这件事情曾经有人提起过；但是依卜不感到什么兴趣。他的老母亲说他最近好像很有心事的样子。的确，他很有心事，他心里想起了他小时候从一个吉卜赛女人那儿得到的三颗榛子——其中两颗他已经给了克丽斯玎。这是希望之果。在她的那两颗果子里，有一颗藏着金车子和马，另一颗藏着非常漂亮的衣服。现在这似乎已成为事实了！在京城哥本哈根，一切华贵的东西她现在都有了。关于她的那一份预言现在已经实现了！\n 依卜的那颗果子里只有一撮黑土。那个吉卜赛女人曾经说过，这是他所得到的“最好的东西”。是的，这现在也要成为事实了！黑土是他所能得到的最好的东西。现在他懂得了那个女人的意思：他的最好的东西是在黑土里，在坟墓的深处。\n 许多年过去了——年数虽然不太多，但依卜却觉得很长。那对年老的旅店主人，先后都去世了。他们全部的财产——几千块钱——都归他们的儿子所有了。是的，现在克丽斯玎可以有金车子和许多漂亮的衣服。\n 在随后的两年内，克丽斯玎没有写信回去。当她父亲最后接到她的一封信的时候，那不是在兴盛和快乐中写的。可怜的克丽斯玎！她和她的丈夫都不知道怎样节约使用这笔财富。它来得容易，去得也容易。它没有带来幸福，因为他们自己不希望有幸福。\n 石南花开了，又谢了。雪花在荒地上，在山脊上，飘过了好几次。\n 在这山脊下，依卜住在一块风吹不到的地方。春天的太阳照得非常明朗：有一天当依卜正在犁地的时候，犁忽然在一块类似燧石的东西上面犁过去了。这时有一堆像刨花的黑东西从土里冒出来。当依卜把它拿起来的时候，发现这原来是一块金属品。那块被犁头划开的地方，现在闪出耀眼的光来。这原来是异教徒时代留下的一个大臂钏。他翻动了一座古墓；现在它里面的财宝被他发现了。依卜把他所发现的东西拿给牧师看。牧师把它的价值解释给他听，然后他就到当地的法官那儿去。法官把这发现报告给哥本哈根的当局，同时劝他亲自把财宝送去。\n “你在土里找到了最好的东西！”法官说。\n “最好的东西！”依卜想。“我所能得到的最好的东西，而且是在土里找到的！如果说这是最好的东西的话，那么那个吉卜赛女人对我所作的预言是兑现了！”\n 于是依卜从奥湖斯乘船到哥本哈根去。他以前只渡过古登诺河，所以这次旅行，对于他说来，等于横渡一次大洋。\n 他到了哥本哈根。\n 他所发现的金子的价钱，当局都付清给他了。这是一笔很大的数目——600块钱。从荒地上树林中来的依卜，现在可以在这热闹的大首都散步了。\n 有一天，在他要跟船长回到奥湖斯去以前，他在街上迷了路；他所走的路，跟他所应该走的方向完全相反。他[走过克尼伯尔桥，]跑到克利斯仙哈文的郊区来[，而没有向西门的城垣走去，他的确是在向西走，但是却没有走到他应去的地方]。这儿一个人也看不见。最后有一个很小的女孩子从一间破烂的屋子里走出来了。依卜向这孩子问他所要寻找的那条街。她怔了一下，朝他看了一眼，接着放声大哭。他问她为什么难过，但是他听不懂她回答的话。他们来到一个路灯下面，灯光正照在她的脸上。他感到非常奇怪，因为这简直是活生生的克丽斯玎在他面前出现，跟他所能记起的她儿时的那副样儿完全一样。\n 他跟着这小姑娘走进那个破烂的屋子里去，爬上一段窄狭破烂的楼梯——它通到顶楼上的一个小房间。这儿的空气是浑浊沉闷的，灯光也没有；从一个小墙角里，飘来一阵沉重的叹息声和急促的呼吸声。依卜划了一根火柴。这孩子的妈妈躺在一张破烂的床上。\n “有什么事需要我帮忙吗？”依卜问。“小姑娘把我带到这儿来，不过我在这个城里是一个生人。你有什么邻居或朋友需要我去替你找来吗？”\n 于是他就把这生病的女人的头扶起来。\n 这原来就是在荒地上长大的克丽斯玎！\n 在尤兰的家里，许多年来没有人提起过她的名字，为的是怕搅乱了依卜的平静的心情。关于她的一些传说的确也是不太好。事实的真相是：她的丈夫自从继承了他父母的那笔财产以后，变得自高自大，胡作非为。他放弃了可靠的工作，跑到外国去旅行了半年；回来的时候，已经负了一身债，但他仍然过着奢侈的生活。正如古话所说的，车子一步一步倾斜，最后完全翻掉了。他的许多逢场作戏的酒肉朋友都说他活该如此，因为他生活得完全像一个疯子。有一天早晨，人们在[皇家花园的]河里发现了他的尸体。\n 死神的手已经搁在克丽斯玎的头上了。她在幸福中盼望的、但在愁苦中出生的最小的孩子：生下来不到几个星期就进入了坟墓。现在轮到克丽斯玎本人了。她病得要死，没有人照料；她躺在一个破烂的房间里，这种贫困，她小时候住在荒地上，可能忍受得下来；但是现在却使她感到痛苦，因为她已经习惯于富裕的生活了。现在跟她一块儿挨饿受穷的，是她的最大的孩子——也是一个小小的克丽斯玎。就是她领依卜进来的。\n “我恐怕快要死了，留下这个孤单的孩子！”她叹了一口气说。“她将怎样在这个世界上生活下去呢？”别的话她一句也说不出来。\n 依卜又划着了一根火柴，找到了一根蜡烛头。他把它点着，照亮这个破烂的住房。\n 依卜看了看这个小女孩，于是他就想起了克丽斯玎年轻时候的那副样子。他觉得，为了克丽斯玎的缘故，他应该爱这个孩子，虽然他并不认识她。那个垂死的女人在凝望着他：她的眼睛越睁越大——难道她认出他了吗？他不知道，他也没有听见她再说一句什么话。\n 这是在古登诺河旁的树林里，在荒地上。\n 空气很阴沉，石南花已经谢了。狂暴的西风把树林里的黄叶吹到河里，吹到荒地上，吹到船夫的小屋里。在茅屋里，现在住着陌生的人。但是在那个山脊下，在许多大树下边的一个避风的处所，有一个小小的农庄。它粉刷和油漆一新。屋子里，泥炭在炉子里烧得正旺。屋子里现在有了太阳光——从小孩子的一双眼睛里发出的太阳光。笑语声，像春天云雀的调子，从这孩子鲜红的嘴唇上流露出来。她坐在依卜的膝上；他是她的父亲，也是她的母亲，因为她的父母都死了，像孩子和成年人的梦一样，也都消逝了。依卜坐在干净漂亮的房子里，现在是一个富裕的人；但是这个小女孩子的母亲却躺在了京城哥本哈根的穷人公墓里。\n 依卜有钱。人们说，[依卜的箱子底上藏着钱——]他将来也不愁吃不愁穿。他从黑土里得到了金子，他还获得了一个小小的克丽斯玎。\n \n 这篇故事发表在安徒生的《故事集》第2版里，实际上是写于1853年作者在丹麦西尔克堡市旅行的时候。那时他的心情很不好。他在手记中这样写道：“我的心情很沉重，不能做什么工作，但我写了一个小故事——写得还不坏，不过里面没有什么太阳光，因为我自己心里也没有。”这个小故事描写的是人世沧桑，也可能与他个人的爱情不幸有某些联系——他少年时代曾经热恋过一个名叫伏格德的村女，而无结果。这正是他进入了中年以后的作品，像《柳树下的梦》一样，幻想和浪漫主义气氛减退了，现实主义成为他的主要特征。他的创作正式进入了一个新时期。\n
