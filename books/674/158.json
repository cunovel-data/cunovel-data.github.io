{"id":28166,"no":158,"title":"THE TALISMAN","content":"A PRINCE and a princess were still celebrating their oneymoon．They were extremely happy； only one houghtdisturbed them， and that was how to retain their present appiness．For that reason they wished to own a talisman with which to protect themselves against any unhappiness intheir marriage．\n Now， they had often been told about a man who livedout in the forest，acclaimed by everybody for his wisdom and known for his good advice in every need and difficulty．So the Prince and Princess called upon him and told him about their heart\u0027s desire．After the wise man had listenedto them he said，\"Travel through every country in the world，and wherever you meet a completely happily married couple，ask them for a small piece of the linen they wear close to the body，and when you receive this， you must always carry it on you． That is a sure remedy！\"\n The Prince and the Princess rode forth， and on theirway they soon heard of a knight and his wife who were saidto be living the most happlly married life．They went to theknight\u0027s castle and asked him and his wife if their marriagewas truly as happy as was rumored．\n \"Yes， of course，\"was the answer，\"with the oneexception that we have no children！\"\n Here then the talisman was not to be found， and thePrince and Princess continued their journey in search of thecompletely happily married couple．\n As they traveled on， they came to a country wherethey heard of an honest citizen who lived in perfect unity and happiness with his wife．So to him they went， and asked if he really was as happily married as people said．\n \"Yes，I am，\"answered the man，\"My wife and I live in perfect harmony； if only we didn\u0027 t have so many chil－dren， for they give us a lot of worries and sorrows！\"\n So neither with him was the talisman to be found，and the Prince and the Princess continued their journey through the country， always inquiring about happily mar- ried couples； but none presented themselves．\n One day，as they rode along fields and meadows， they noticed a shepherd close by the road， cheerfully playing his flute． Just then a woman carrying a child in her arm， and holding a little boy by the hand， walked to- wards him． As soon as the shepherd saw her， he greeted her and took the little child， whom he kissed and ca－ressed． The shepherd\u0027s dog ran to the boy， licked his lit－tle hand，and barked and jumped with joy．In the mean－ time the woman arranged a meal she had brought along，and then said，\"Father，come and eat now！\"The man sat down and took of the food， but the first bite he gave to the little boy， and the second he divided between the boy and the dog． All this was observed by the Prince and the Princess， who walked closer， and spoke to them， saying， \"You must be a truly happily married couple．\"\n \"Yes，that we are，\"said the man．\" God bepraised； no prince or princess could be happier than we are！\"\n \"Now listen then，\"said the Prince．\n \"Do us a favor，and you shall never regret it． Give usa small piece of the linen garment you wear close to yourbody！\"\n As he spoke， the shepherd and his wife looked strangely at each other， and finally he said，\"God knowswe would be only too happy to give you not only a small piece，but the whole shirt， or undergarment， if we onlyhad them，but we own not as much as a rag！\"\n So the Prince and the Princess journeyed on， theirmission unaccomplished． Finally， their unsuccessful roam－ing discouraged them， and they decided to return home． Asthey passed the wise man\u0027s hut， they stopped by，relatedall their travel experiences，and reproached him for givingthem such poor advice．\n At that the wise man smiled and said，\"Has your tripreally been all in vain？ Are you not returning richer inknowledge？\"\n \"Yes，\"answered the Prince，\"I have gained this knowledge，that contentment is a rare gift on this earth．\"\n \"And I have learned，\" said the Princess，\"that to becontented，one needs nothing more than simply to be con－tented！\"\n Whereupon the Prince took the Princess\u0027 hand；theylooked at each other with an expression of deepest love．And the wise man blessed them and said，\"In your ownhearts you have found the true talisman！ Guard it careful－ly，and the evil spirit of discontentment shall never in alleternity have any power over you！\"\n 神方\n \n 一位王子和一位王妃现在还在度蜜月。他们感到自己非常幸福。只有一件事情使他们苦恼，那就是：怎样使他们永远像现在这样幸福。因此他们就想得到一个“神方”，用以防止他们夫妻生活中的不幸。他们常常听说深山老林里住着一位大家公认的智者，对于在困苦和灾难中的人，他都能做出最好的忠告。于是这位王子和王妃特地去拜访他，同时把他们的心事也对他讲了。这位智者了解到他们的来意以后就说：“你们可以到世界各国去旅行一下。无论在什么地方，只要你们碰到一对完全幸福的夫妇，就可以向他们要一块他们贴身穿的衣服的布片。你们必须把这块布片经常带在身边。这是唯一有效的办法。”\n 王子和王妃骑着马走了。不多久他们就听到一位骑士的名字。据说这位骑士和他的妻子过着最幸福的生活。他们来到他的城堡里，亲自问：他们的婚后生活是否真如传说的那样，过得非常美满。\n “一点也不错！”对方回答说，“只有一件事：我们没有孩子！”\n 在这里是得不到“神方”了。王子和王妃只好旅行得更远一点，去寻找绝对幸福的夫妇。\n 他们来到一个城市。他们听说这里住着一位市民：他和他的妻子过着极端亲爱的满足的生活。他们去拜访他，问他是不是像大家所说的那样，过着真正美满的婚后生活。\n “对，我过着这样的生活！”这人说，“我的妻子和我共同过着最美满的生活，只可惜我们的孩子太多了——他们给我们带来许多苦恼和麻烦！”\n 因此在这人身上也找不出什么“神方”。王子和王妃向更远的地方去旅行，不断地探问是否有幸福的夫妇，但是一对也找不到。有一天，当他们正在田野和草场上走的时候，离开大路不远，他们遇见一个牧羊人。这人在快乐地吹一管笛子。正在这时候，他们看见一个女人怀里抱一个孩子，手上牵一个孩子，在向他走来。牧羊人一看见她，就马上向她走去，向她打招呼，同时把那个顶小的孩子接过来，吻一阵，然后又抚摸一阵。牧羊人的狗向那男孩子跑过去，舔他的手，狂叫一阵，然后又高兴地狂跳一阵。在这同时，女人把她带来的食物拿出来，说：“孩子他爸，过来，吃饭吧！”这男子坐下来，接过食物，把第一口让那个顶小的孩子吃，把剩下的分给男孩子和那只看羊狗。王子和王妃亲眼看见、也亲耳听见这一切。他们走向前，对牧羊人这一家说：“你们一定是大家谈的最幸福、最满足的夫妇了吧？”\n “对，我们是的！”丈夫回答说，“感谢上帝！没有哪个王子和王妃能够像我们这样快乐！”\n “请听着，”王子说，\n “我们有一件事要请求你帮助，你决不会后悔的。请你把你最贴身穿着的衣服撕一块给我们吧！”\n 听到这句话，牧羊人和他的妻子就惊奇地彼此呆呆地望着。最后牧羊人说：“上帝知道，我们很愿意给你一块，不仅是布片，连整件衬衫或内衣都可以——只要我们有的话。不过我们连一件破衣都没有。”\n 王子和王妃没有办法，只好再旅行到更远的地方去。最后，他们对于这种漫长而无结果的漫游感到厌倦起来了，因此他们就回到家里来。当他们经过那智者的茅屋的时候，他们就责骂他，因为他所给的忠告是那么没有用。他们把旅行的经过全部告诉了他。\n 这位智者微笑了一下，说，“你们的旅行是真的没有结果吗？你们现在不是带着更丰富的经验回家来了吗？”\n “是的，”王子回答说，“我已经体会到，‘满足’是这个世界上一件难得的宝贝。”\n “我也学习到，”王妃说，“一个人要感到满足，没有别的办法——自己满足就得了！”\n 于是王子拉着王妃的手，互相望着，露出一种极端亲爱的表情。那位智者祝福他们，说：“你们在自己的心里已经找到了真正的‘神方’！好好地保存着吧，这样，那个‘不满足’的妖魔对你们就永远无能为力了！”\n 这篇小品最初发表在1836年11月4日的《丹麦大众报》上。这里谈的是对“永远幸福”的“神方”的追求。满足”就是这种“神方”。“一个人要感到满足，没有别的办法——自己满足就得了！”\n \n
