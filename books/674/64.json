{"id":28072,"no":64,"title":"EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE","content":"IT was more than a hundred years ago．\\n\\n Behind the wood，by the great lake，stood the old baronial mansion．Round about it lay a deep moat，in which grew reeds and grass．Close by the bridge，near the en－trance gate，rose an old willow tree that bent over the reeds．\\n\\n Up from the hollow lane sounded the clang of horns and the trampling of horses；therefore the little girl who kept the geese hastened to drive her charges away from the bridge，before the hunting company should come gallopping by．They drew near with such speed that the girl was obliged to climb up in a hurry，and perch herself on the coping-stone of the bridge，lest she should be ridden down．She was still half a child，and had a pretty light figure，and a gentle expression in her face，with two chear blue eyes．The noble baron took no note of this，but as he gallopped past the little goose－herd，he reversed the whip he held in his hand，and in rough sport gave her such a push in the chest with the butt－end that she fell backwards into the ditch．\\n\\n “Everything in its place！”he cried；“into the puddle with you！”And he laughed aloud，for this was intended for wit，and the company joined in his mirth：the whole party shouted and clamoured，and the dogs barked their loudest．\\n\\n Fortunately for herself，the poor girl in falling seized one of the hanging branches of the willow tree，by means of which she kept herself suspended over the muddy water，and as soon as the baron and his company had disappeared through the castle gate，the girl tried to scramble up again；but the bough broke off at the top，and she would have fallen backward among the reeds，if a strong hand from above had not at that moment seized her．It was the hand of a pedlar，who had seen from a short distance what had happened，and who now hurried up to give aid．\\n\\n “Everything in its right place！”he said，mimicking the gracious baron；and he drew the little maiden up to the firm ground．He would have restored the broken branch to the place from which it had been torn，but“everything in its place”cannot always be managed，and therefore he stuck the piece in the ground．“Grow and prosper till you can furnish a good flute for them up yon－der，”he said；for he would have liked to play the “rogue\u0027s march”for my lord the baron and my lord\u0027s whole family．\\n\\n And then he betook himself to the castle，but not into the ancestral hall，he was too humble for that！He went to the servants’ quarters，and the men and maids turned over his stock of goods，and bargained with him；but from above，where the guests were at table，came a sound of roaring and screaming that was intended for song，and indeed they did their best．Loud laughter，mingled with the barking and howling of dogs resounded，for there was feasting and carousing up yonder．Wine and strong old ale foamed in the jugs and glasses，and the dogs sat with their masters and dined with them．They had the pedlar summoned upstairs，but only to make fun of him．The wine had mounted into their heads，and the sense had flown out．They poured ale into a stocking，that the pedlar might drink with them，but that he must drink quickly；that was considered a rare jest，and was a causc of fresh laughter．And then whole farms，with oxen and peasants too，were staked on a card，and lost and won．\\n\\n “Everything in its right place！”said the pedlar，when he had at last made his escape out of what he called “Sodom and Gomorrah．”“The open high road is my right place，” he said；“I did not feel at all happy there．”\\n\\n And the little maiden who sat keeping the geese nodded at him from the gate of the field．\\n\\n And days and weeks went by；and it became manifest that the willow branch which the pedlar had stuck into the ground by the castle moat remained fresh and green，and even brought forth new twigs．The little goose－girl saw that the branch must have taken root，and rejoiced greatly at the circumstance；for this tree，she thought，was now her tree．\\n\\n The tree certainly came forward well；but everything else belonging to the castle went very rapidly back，what with feasting and gambling——for these two are like wheels，upon which no man can stand securely．\\n\\n Six years had not passed away before the noble lord passed out of the castle gate，a beggared man，and the mansion was bought by a rich dealer；and this purchaser was the very man who had once been made a jest of there，for whom ale had been poured into a stocking；but honesty and industry are good winds to speed a vessel；and now the dealer was possessor of the baronial estate．But from that hour no more card-playing was permitted there．\\n\\n “That is bad reading，”said he：“When the Evil One saw a Bible for the first time，he wanted to put a bad book against it，and invented card-playing．”\\n\\n The new proprietor took a wife，and who might that be but the goose－girl，who had always been faithful and good，and looked as beautiful and fine in her new clothes as if she had been born a great lady．And how did all this come about？That is too long a story for our busy time，but it really happened，and the most important part is to come．\\n\\n It was a good thing now to be in the old mansion．The mother managed the domestic affairs，and the father super－intended the estate，and it seemed as if blessings were streaming down．Where prosperity is，prosperity is sure to follow．The old house was cleaned and painted，the ditches were cleared and fruit trees planted．Everything wore a bright cheerful look，and the floors were as polished as a draught-board．In the long winter evenings the lady sat at the spinning-wheel with her maids，and every Sunday evening there was a reading from the Bible by the Councillor of Justice Himself——this title the dealer had gained，though it was only in his old age．The children grew up——for children had come——and they received the best education，though all had not equal abilities，as we find indeed in all families．\\n\\n In the meantime the willow branch at the castle gate had grown to be a splendid tree，which stood there free and unpolled．“That is our family tree，” the old people said，and the tree was to be honoured and respected——so they told all the children，even those who had not very good heads．\\n\\n And a hundred years rolled by．\\n\\n It was in our own time．The lake had been converted to moorland，and the old mansion had almost disappeared．A pool of water and the ruins of some walls，this was all that was left of the old baronial castle，with its deep moat；and here stood also a magnificent old willow，with pendent boughs，which seemed to show how beautiful a tree may be if left to itself．The main stem was certainly split from the root to the crown，and the storm had bowed the noble tree a little；but it stood firm for all that，and from every cleft into which wind and weather had carried a portion of earth，grasses and flowers sprang forth：especially near the top，where the great branches parted，a sort of hanging garden had been formed of wild raspberry bush，and even a small quantity of rowan－tree had taken root，and stood，slender and graceful，in the midst of the old willow which was mirrored in the dark water when the wind had driven the duck－meat away into a corner of the pool．A field-path led close by the old tree．\\n\\n High by the forest hill，with a splendid prospect in every direction，stood the new hall，large and magnificent，with panes of glass so clearly transparent，that it looked as if there were no panes there at all．The grand flight of steps that led to the entrance looked like a bower of roses and broad-leaved plants．The lawn was as freshly green as if each separate blade of glass were cleaned morning and evening．In the hall hung costly pictures；silken chairs and sofas stood there，so easy that they looked almost as if they could run by themselves；there were tables of great marble slabs，and books bound in morocco and gold．Yes，truly，people of rank lived here：the baron with his family．\\n\\n All things here corresponded with each other．The motto was still“Everything in its right place”；and there－fore all the pictures which had been put up in the old house for honour and glory，hung now in the passage that led to the servants’ hall：they were considered as old lumber，and especially two old portraits，one representing a man in a pink coat and powdered wig，the other a lady with powdered hair and holding a rose in her hand，and each surrounded with a wreath of willow leaves．These two pictures were pierced with many holes，because the little barons were in the habit of setting up the old people as a mark for their crossbows．The pictures represented the Councillor of Justice and his lady，the founders of the pre－sent family．\\n\\n “But they did not properly belong to our family，”said one of the little barons．“He was a dealer，and she had kept the geese．They were not like papa and mamma．”\\n\\n The pictures were pronounced to be worthless；and as the motto was“Everything in its right place”，the great-grandmother and great-grandfather were sent into the pas-sage that led to the servants’hall．\\n\\n The son of the neighbouring clergyman was tutor in the great house．One day he was out walking with his pupils，the little barons and their eldest sister，who had just been confirmed；they came along the field－path past the old willow，and as they walked on，the young lady bound a wreath of field flowers．“Everything in its right place，”and the flowers formed a pretty whole．At the same time she heard every word that was spoken，and she liked to hear the clergyman\u0027s son talk of the powers of nature and of the great men and women in history．She had a goodhearted disposition，with true nobility of thought and soul，and a heart full of love for all that God hath created．\\n\\n The party came to a halt at the old willow tree．The youngest baron insisted on having such a flute out for him from it as he had had made of other willows．Accordingly the tutor broke off a branch．\\n\\n “Oh，don\u0027t do that！”cried the young baroness；but it was done already．“That is our famous old tree，” she continued，“and I love it dearly．They laugh at me at home for this，but I don\u0027t mind．There is a story attached to this tree．”\\n\\n And she told what we all know about the tree，about the old mansion，the pedlar and the goose－girl，who had met for the first time in this spot，and had afterwards become the founders of the noble family to which the young barons belonged．\\n\\n “They would not be ennobled，the good old folks！”she said．“They kept to the motto，‘ Everything in its right place’；and accordingly they thought it would be out of place for them to purchase a title with money．My grandfather，the first baron，was their son．He is said to have been a very learned，very popular with princes and princesses，and a frequent guest at the court festivals．The others at home love him best；but，I don\u0027t know how，there seems to me something about that first pair that draws my heart towards them．How comfortable，how patriarchal it must have been in the old house，where the mistress sat at the spinning－wheel among her maids，and the old master read aloud from the Bible！”\\n\\n “They were charming，sensible people，”said the clergy－man\u0027s son．\\n\\n And with this the conversation naturally fell upon no－bles and citizens．The young man scarcely seemed to be－long to the citizen class，so well did he speak of things be－longing to nobility．He said，\\n\\n “It is a great thing to belong to a family that has distinguished itself，and thus to have，as it were，in one\u0027s blood；a spur that urges one on to make progress in all that is good．It is delightful to have a name that serves as a card of admission into the highest circles．Nobility means that which is noble：it is a coin that has received a stamp to indicate what it is worth．It is the fallacy of the time，and many poets have frequently maintained this fallacy，that nobility of birth is accompanied by foolishness，and that the lower you go among the poor，the more does every－thing around you shine．But that is not my view，for I consider it entirely false．In the higher classes many beautiful and kindly traits are found．My mother told me one of this kind，and I could tell you many others．\\n\\n “My mother was on a visit to a great family in town．My grandmother，I think，had been nurse to the lady there．The great nobleman and my mother were alone in the room，when the former noticed that an old woman came limping on crutches into the courtyard．Indeed，she was accustomed to come every Sunday，and carry away a gift with her．‘Ah，there is the poor old lady，\u0027said the noble－man：‘walking is a great toil to her；’ and before my mother understood what he meant，he had gone out of the room and run down the stairs，to save the old woman the toilsome walk，by carrying to her the gift she had come to receive．\\n\\n “Now，that was only a small circumstance，but，like the widow\u0027s two mites in the Scriptures，it has a sound that finds an echo in the depths of the heart in human nature；and these are the things the poet should show and point out；especially in these times should he sing of it，for that does good，and pacifies and unites men．But where a bit of mortality，because it has a genealogical tree and a coat of arms，rears up like an Arab horse，and prances in the street，and says in the room，‘People from the street have been here，’when a commoner has been present，——that is nobility in decay and turned into a mere mask，a mask of the kind that Thespis created；and people are glad when such a one is made a subject of satire．”\\n\\n This was the speech of the clergyman\u0027s son．It was certainly rather long，but then the flute was finished while he made it．\\n\\n At the castle there was a great company．Many guests came from the neighbourhoood and from the capital．Many ladies，some tastefully dressed and others dressed without taste，were there，and the great hall was quite full of people．The clergymen from the neighbourhood stood respect－fully congregated in a corner，which made it look almost as if it was a burial．But it was not so，for this was a party of pleasure，only that the pleasure had not yet begun．\\n\\n A great concert was to be performed，and consequent－ly the little baron had brought in his willow flute；but he could not get a note out of it，nor could his papa，and therefore the flute was worth nothing．There was instrumental music and song，both of the kind that delight the performers most——quite charming！\\n\\n “You are a performer？”said a fine gentleman——his father\u0027s son and nothing else——to the tutor．“You play the flute and make it too——it is genius which commands，and should have the place of honour！Oh yes！I advance with the times，as every one is obliged to do．Oh，you will enchant us with the little instrument，will you not？”\\n\\n And with these words he handed to the clergyman\u0027s son the flute cut from the willow tree by the pool，and announced aloud that the tutor was about to perform a solo on that instrument．\\n\\n Now，they only wanted to make fun of him，that was easily seen；and therefore the tutor would not play，though indeed he could do so very well；but they crowded round him and importuned him so strongly，that at last he took the flute and put it to his lips．\\n\\n That was a wonderful flute！A sound，as sustained as that which is emitted by the whistle of a steam engine，and much stronger，echoed far over courtyard，garden，and wood，miles away into the country；and simultaneously with the tone came a rushing wind that roared，“Everything in its right place！”And papa flew as if carried by the wind straight out of the hall and into the shepherd\u0027s；and the shepherd flew，not into the hall，for there he could not come——no，but into the room of the servants，among the smart who strutted about there in silk stockings；and the proud servants were struck motionless with horror at the thought that such a personage dared to sit down to table with them．\\n\\n But in the hall the young baroness flew up to the place of honour at the top of the table，where she was worthy to sit；and the young clergyman\u0027s son had a seat next to her；and there the two sat as if they were a newly－married pair．An old count of one of the most ancient families in the country remained untouched in his place of honour；for the flute was just，as men ought to be．The witty young gentleman，the son of his father and nothing else，who had been the cause of the flute－playing，flew head－over-heels into the poultry house——but not alone．\\n\\n For a whole mile round about the sounds of the flute were heard，and singular events took place．A rich merchant\u0027s family，driving along in a coach and four，was blown quite out of the carriage，and could not even find a place on the footboard at the back．Two rich peasants who in our times had grown too high for their cornfields，were tumbled into the ditch．It was a dangerous flute，that：luckily，it burst at the first note；and that was a good thing，for then it was put back into the owner\u0027s pocket．“Everything in its right place．”\\n\\n The day afterwards not a word was said about this marvellous event；and thence has come the expression，“pocketing the flute”．Everything was in its usual order，only that the two old portraits of the dealer and the goose－girl hung on the wall in the banqueting－hall．They had been blown up there，and as one of the real connoisseurs said they had been painted by a master\u0027s hand，they remained where they were，and were restored．One did not know before that they were any good，and how should it have been known？Now they hung in the place of honour：“Everything in its right place．”\\n\\n And to that it will come hereafter；for hereafter is long——longer than this story．\\n\\n 各得其所\\n\\n \\n\\n 这是一百多年以前的事情了！\\n\\n 在树林后面的一个大湖旁边，有一座古老的男爵府。它的周围有一道很深的壕沟；里面长着许多芦苇和草。在通向入口的那座桥边，长着一棵古老的柳树；它的枝子垂向这些芦苇。\\n\\n 从空巷里传来一阵号角声和马蹄声；一个牧鹅姑娘趁着一群猎人没有奔驰过来以前，就赶快把她的一群鹅从桥边赶走。猎人飞快地跑近来了，她只好急忙爬到桥头的一块石头上，免得被他们踩倒。她仍然是个孩子，身材很瘦削；但是她面上有一种和蔼的表情和一双明亮的眼睛。那位男爵老爷没有注意到这点。当他飞驰过去的时候，他把鞭子掉过来，恶作剧地用鞭子的把手朝这女孩子的胸脯一推，弄得她仰着滚下壕沟去了。\\n\\n “各得其所！”他大声说，“请你滚到泥巴里去吧！”\\n\\n 他哄笑起来。因为他觉得这很好笑，所以和他一道的人也都笑起来。全体人马都大肆叫嗥，连猎犬也咬起来。［这真是所谓：\\n\\n “富鸟飞来声音大！”\\n\\n 只有上帝知道，他现在还是不是富有。］还算幸运，这个可怜的牧鹅女在落下去的时候，伸手乱抓，结果抓住了柳树的一根垂枝，这样她就悬在泥沼上面。一等到男爵和他的随从走进大门不见了，她就想法再爬上来，但是枝子忽然在顶上断了；要不是上面有一只强壮的手抓住了她，她就要落到芦苇里去了。这人是一个流浪的小贩。他从不远的地方看到了这件事情，所以他现在就急忙赶过来帮助她。\\n\\n “各得其所！”他模拟那位老爷的口吻开玩笑地说。于是他就把小姑娘拉到干地上来。他倒很想把那根断了的枝子接上，但是“各得其所”不是在任何场合下都可以做得到的！因此他就把这枝子插到柔软的土里。他说：“假如你能够的话，生长吧，一直长到你可以成为那个公馆里的人们的一管笛子！”他倒希望这位老爷和他的一家人挨一次痛打呢。\\n\\n 然后，他走进这个公馆里去，但并不是走进客厅，因为他太微贱了！他走进仆人住的地方去。他们翻了翻他的货品，争论了一番价钱。但是从上房的酒席桌上，飘来一阵喧噪和尖叫声——这就是他们所谓的唱歌；比这更好的东西他们就不会了。上面正在大吃大喝，笑声和犬吠声混作一团。普通酒和强烈的啤酒在酒罐和玻璃杯里冒着泡，狗子跟主人坐在一起吃喝。［有的狗子用耳朵把鼻子擦干净以后，还得到少爷们的亲吻。］他们请这小贩［带着他的货品走］上来，不过他们的目的是要开他的玩笑。酒已经冲上了他们的脑袋，理智已经飞走了。他们把啤酒倒进袜子里，请这小贩跟他们一起喝，但是必须喝得快！这办法既巧妙，而又能逗人发笑。然后他们把牲口、农奴和农庄都拿出来作为玩牌赌注，有的赢了，有的输了。\\n\\n “各得其所！”小贩在走出了这个他所谓的“罪恶的渊薮”的时候说。“我的处‘所’是宽广的大路，我在那家一点也不感到自在。”\\n\\n 牧鹅的小姑娘从田野的篱笆那儿对他点头。\\n\\n 许多天过去了。许多星期过去了。小贩插在壕沟旁边的那根折断了的杨柳枝，显然还是新鲜和翠绿的；它甚至还冒出了嫩芽。牧鹅的小姑娘知道这根枝子现在生了根，所以她感到非常愉快，因为她觉得这棵树是她的树。\\n\\n 这棵树在茁壮生长。但是公馆里的一切，在喝酒和赌博中很快地就搞光了——因为这两件东西像轮子一样，任何人在上面是站不稳的。\\n\\n 6个年头还没有过完，老爷（沦为乞丐），［拿着袋子和手杖，作为一个穷人］走出了这个公馆。公馆被一个富有的小贩买去了。他就是曾经在这儿被戏弄和讥笑过的那个人——那个要从袜子里喝啤酒的人。但是诚实和勤俭带来兴盛；现在这个小贩成为了公馆的主人。不过从这时起，打纸牌的这种赌博就不许在这儿再玩了。\\n\\n “这是很坏的消遣，”他说，“当魔鬼第一次看到《圣经》的时候，他就想放一本坏书来抵消它，于是他就发明了纸牌戏！”\\n\\n 这位新主人娶了一个太太。她不是别人，就是那个牧鹅的女郎。她一直是很忠诚、虔敬和善良的。她穿上新衣服非常漂亮，好像她天生就是一个贵妇人似的。事情怎么会是这样呢？是的，在我们这个忙碌的时代里，这是一个很长的故事；不过事情确实如此，而且最重要的一部分还在后面。\\n\\n 住在这座古老的邸宅里是很幸福的。母亲管家里的事，父亲管外面的事，幸福好像是从泉水里涌出来的。凡是幸运的地方，就经常有幸运来临。这座老房子被打扫和油漆得一新；壕沟也清除了，果木树也种起来了。一切都显得温暖而愉快；地板擦得很亮，像一个棋盘。在漫长的冬夜里，女主人同她的女佣人坐在堂屋里织羊毛或纺线。礼拜天的晚上，司法官——那个小贩成了司法官，虽然他现在已经很老了——就读一段《圣经》。孩子们——因为他们生了孩子——都长大了，而且受到了很好的教育，虽然像在别的家庭里一样，他们的能力各有不同。\\n\\n 公馆门外的那根柳树枝，已经长成为一棵美丽的树。它自由自在地立在那儿，还没有被剪过枝。“这是我们的家族树！”这对老夫妇说；这树应该得到光荣和尊敬——他们这样告诉他们的孩子，包括那些头脑不太聪明的孩子。\\n\\n 一百年过去了。\\n\\n 这就是我们的时代。湖已经变成了一块沼地。那座老邸宅也几乎不见了，现在只剩下一个长方形的水潭，两边立着一些断垣残壁。这就是男爵老爷那座有壕沟的老城堡的遗址。这儿还立着一株壮丽的老垂柳。［它就是那株老家族树。］这似乎是说明，一棵树如果你不去管它，它会变得多么美丽。当然，它的主干从根到顶都裂开了；风暴也把它打得略为弯了一点。虽然如此，它仍然立得很坚定，而且在每一个裂口里——风和雨送了些泥土进去——还长出了草和花；尤其是在顶上大枝丫分杈的地方，许多覆盆子［和繁缕］形成一个悬空的花园。这儿甚至还长出了几棵山梨树，它们苗条地立在这株老柳树的身上。当风儿把青浮草吹到水潭的一个角落里去了的时候，老柳树的影子就在荫深的水上出现。一条小径从这树的近旁一直伸到田野。\\n\\n 在树林附近的一个风景优美的小山上，有一座新房子，既宽大，又华丽，窗玻璃是那么透明，人们可能以为它完全没有镶玻璃。大门前面的宽大台阶很像玫瑰花和宽叶植物所形成的一个花亭。草坪是那么碧绿，好像每一片叶子早晚都被冲洗过了一番似的。厅堂里悬着华贵的绘画。套着锦缎［和天鹅绒］的椅子和沙发，简直像自己能够走动似的。此外还有光亮的大理石桌子，烫金的皮装的书籍。是的，这儿住着的是富有的人；这儿住着的是贵族——男爵一家。\\n\\n 这儿一切东西都配得很调和。这儿的格言是：“各得其所！”因此从前在那座老房子里光荣地、排场地挂着的一些绘画，现在统统都在通到仆人住处的走廊上挂着。它们现在成了废物——特别是那两幅老画像：一幅是一位穿粉红上衣和戴着扑了粉的假发的绅士，另一幅是一位太太——她的向上梳的头发也扑了粉，她的手里拿着一朵红玫瑰花。他们两人四周围着一圈柳树枝所编成的花环。这两张画上布满了圆洞，因为小男爵们常常把这两位老人当作他们射箭的靶子。这两位老人就是司法官和他的夫人——这个家族的始祖。\\n\\n “但是他们并不真正属于这个家族！”一位小男爵说。“他是一个小贩，而她是一个牧鹅的丫头。他们一点也不像爸爸和妈妈。”\\n\\n 这两张画成为没有价值的废物。因此，正如人们所说的，它们“各得其所”！曾祖父和曾祖母就来到通向仆人宿舍的走廊里了。\\n\\n 牧师的儿子是这个公馆里的家庭教师。有一天他和小男爵们以及他们受了坚信礼不久的姐姐到外面去散步。他们沿着那棵老柳树旁边的一条小径走来；当他们正在走的时候，这位小姐就用田里的小花扎了一个花束。“各得其所，”所以这些花儿也形成了一个美丽的整体。在这同时，她倾听着大家的高谈阔论。她喜欢听牧师的儿子谈起大自然的威力，谈起历史上伟大的男子和女人。她有健康愉快的个性，高尚的思想和灵魂，还有一颗喜爱上帝所创造一切事物的心。\\n\\n 他们在老柳树旁边停下来。最小的那位男爵很希望有一管笛子，因为他从前也有过一管用柳树枝雕的笛子。牧师的儿子便折下一根枝子。\\n\\n “啊，请不要这样做吧！”那位年轻的女男爵说。然而这已经做了。“这是我们的一棵有名的老树，我非常心疼它！他们在家里常常因此笑我，但是我不管！这棵树有一个来历！”。\\n\\n 于是她就把她所知道的关于这树的事情全讲出来：关于那个老邸宅的事情，以及那个小贩和那个牧鹅姑娘怎样在这地方第一次遇见，后来他们又怎样成为这个有名的家族和这些年轻男爵的始祖的事情。\\n\\n “这两个善良的老人，他们不愿意成为贵族！”她说，“他们遵守着‘各得其所’的格言；因此他们就觉得，假如他们用钱买来一个爵位，那就与他们的地位不相称了。只有他们的儿子——我们的祖父——才正式成为一位男爵。据说他是一位非常有学问的人，他常常跟王子和公主们来往，还常常参加他们的宴会。家里所有的人都非常喜欢他。但是，我不知道为什么，最初的那对老人对我的心有某种吸引力。那个老房子里的生活一定是这样地安静和庄严：主妇和女仆们一起坐着纺纱，老主人高声朗诵着《圣经》。”\\n\\n “他们是一对可爱的通情理的人！”牧师的儿子说。\\n\\n 到这儿，他们的谈话就自然接触到贵族和市民了。牧师的儿子几乎不太像市民阶层的人，因为当他谈起关于贵族的事情时，他是那么内行。他说：\\n\\n “一个人作为一个有名望的家庭的一员是一桩幸运！同样，一个人血统里有一种鼓舞他向上的动力，也是一桩幸运。一个人有一个族名作为走进上流社会的桥梁，是一桩美事。贵族是高贵的意思。它是一块金币，上面刻着它的价值。我们这个时代有一种论调——许多诗人也自然随声附和——那就是：一切高贵的东西总是愚蠢［和没有价值］的；至于穷人，他们越不行，他们就越聪明。不过这不是我的见解，因为我认为这种看法完全是错误的［，虚伪的］。在上流阶级里面，人们可以发现许多美丽和感动人的特点。我的母亲告诉过我一个例子，而且我还可以举出许多别的来。\\n\\n 她到城里去拜访一个贵族家庭。我想，我的祖母曾经当过那家主妇的乳母。我的母亲有一天跟那位高贵的老爷坐在一个房间里。他看见一个老太婆拄着拐杖蹒跚地走进院子里来。她是每个礼拜天都来的，而且一来就带走几个银毫。‘那个可怜的老太婆来了，’老爷说；‘她走路真不容易！’在我的母亲还没有懂得他的意思以前，他就走出了房门，跑下楼梯，亲自走到那个穷苦的老太婆身边去，免得她为了取几个银毫而要走艰难的路。\\n\\n 这不过是一件小小的事情；但是，像《圣经》上所写的寡妇的一文钱一样，它在人心的深处，在人类的天性中引起一个回音。诗人就应该把这类事情指出来，歌颂它，特别是在我们这个时代，因为这会发生好的作用，会安抚人心［，让大家团结起来］。不过有的人，因为有高贵的血统，同时出身于望族，常常像阿拉伯的马一样，喜欢跷起前腿在大街上嘶鸣。只要有一个普通人来过，他就在房间里说：‘平民曾经到过此地！’这说明贵族在腐化，变成了一个贵族的假面具，一个德斯比斯所创造的那种面具。人们讥笑这种人，把他当成讽刺的对象。”\\n\\n 这就是牧师的儿子的一番议论。它的确未免太长了一点，但在这期间，那管笛子却雕成了。\\n\\n 公馆里有一大批客人。他们都是从附近地区和京城里来的。许多女士都来了，她们有些穿得很入时，有的不入时。大客厅里挤满了人。附近地区的一些牧师都是恭而敬之地挤在一个角落里——这使人觉得好像要举行一个葬礼似的。但是这却是一个欢乐的场合，只不过欢乐还没有开始罢了。\\n\\n 这儿应该有一个盛大的音乐会才好。因此一位小男爵就把他的柳树笛子取出来，不过他吹不出声音来，他的爸爸也吹不出，所以它成了一个废物。\\n\\n 这儿现在有了音乐，也有了歌唱，它们都使演唱者本人感到最愉快，当然这也不坏！\\n\\n “你也是一个音乐家吗？”一位漂亮绅士——他只不过是他父母的儿子——对家庭教师说。“你吹奏这管笛子，而且你还亲手把它雕出来。这简直是天才，而天才坐在光荣的席位上，统治着一切。啊，天啦！我是在跟着时代走——每个人非这样不可。啊，请你用这小小的乐器来迷住我们一下吧，好不好？”\\n\\n 于是他就把用水池旁的那株柳树枝雕成的笛子交给牧师的儿子。他同时大声说，这位家庭教师将要用这乐器对大家作一个独奏。\\n\\n 现在他们要开他的玩笑，这是很清楚的了。因此这位家庭教师就不吹了，虽然他可以吹得很好。但是他们却围在他旁边，坚持要他吹，弄得他最后只好拿起笛子，凑到嘴上。\\n\\n 这真是一管奇妙的笛子！它发出一个怪声音，比蒸汽机所发出的汽笛声还要长，还要粗。它在院子上空，在花园和森林里盘旋，远远地飘到数里之外的田野上去。跟这音调同时，吹来了一阵呼啸的狂风，它呼啸着说：“各得其所！”于是爸爸就好像被风在吹动似地，飞出了大厅，落在牧人的房间里去了；而牧人也飞起来，但是却没有飞进那个大厅里去，因为他不能去——嗨，他却飞到仆人的宿舍里去，飞到那些穿着丝袜子、大摇大摆地走着路的、漂亮的侍从中间去。这些骄傲的仆人们被弄得目瞪口呆，想道：这么一个下贱的人物居然敢跟他们一道坐上桌子。\\n\\n 但是在大厅里，年轻的女男爵飞到了桌子的首席上去。她是有资格坐在这儿的。牧师的儿子坐在她的旁边。他们两人这样坐着，好像他们是一对新婚夫妇似的。只有一位老伯爵——他属于这国家的一个最老的家族——仍然坐在他尊贵的位子上没有动；因为这管笛子是很公正的，人也应该是这样。那位幽默的漂亮绅士——他只不过是他父亲的儿子——这次吹笛的煽动人，倒栽葱地飞进一个鸡屋里去了，但他并不是孤独地一个人在那儿。\\n\\n 在附近一带10多里地以内，大家都听到了笛声，而且发生了一些奇怪的事情。一个富有商人的全家，坐在一辆四匹马拉的车子里，被吹出了车厢，连在车后都找不到一块地方站着。\\n\\n 两个有钱的农夫，他们在我们这个时代长得比他们田里的麦子还高，却被吹到泥巴沟里去了。这是一管危险的笛子！很幸运的是，它在发出第一个调子后就裂开了。这是一件好事，因为这样它就又被放进主人的衣袋里去了：\\n\\n “各得其所！”\\n\\n 随后的一天，谁也不提起这件事情，因此我们就有了“笛子入袋”这个成语。每件东西都回到它原来的位子上。只有那个小贩和牧鹅女的画像挂到大客厅里来了。它们是被吹到那儿的墙上去的。正如一位真正的鉴赏家说过的一样，它们是由一位名家画出来的；所以它们现在挂在它们应该挂的地方。人们从前不知道它们有什么价值，而人们又怎么会知道呢？现在它们悬在光荣的位置上：“各得其所！”事情就是这样！永恒的真理是很长的——比这个故事要长得多。\\n\\n 这个小故事最初发表在1853年出版的《故事集》第2卷。这是一篇有关世态的速写。真正“光荣”的是那些勤劳、质朴、善良的人们，他们的画像应该“悬在最光荣的位置上。”那些装腔作势，高视阔步的大人物，实际上什么也不是，只不过“倒栽葱地飞进一个鸡屋里去了。”这就是“各得其所”，其寓意是很深的。安徒生在他的手记中说：“诗人蒂勒（T．M．Thiele，1795——1874）对我说：‘写一篇关于把一切吹到它恰当的位置上的笛子的故事吧。’我的这篇故事的来历，就完全源自这句话。”\\n\\n
