{"id":28073,"no":65,"title":"THE GOBLIN AND THE HUCKSTER","content":"THERE was once a regular student：he lived in a garret，and nothing at all belonged to him；but there was also once a regular huckster：he lived on the ground floor，and the whole house was his；and the Goblin lodged with him，for here，every Christmas－eve，there was a dish of porridge，with a great piece of butter float-in in the middle．The huckster could give that，and consequently the Goblin stuck to the huckster\u0027s shop，and that was very interesting．\\n\\n One evening the student came through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself．He had no one to send，and that\u0027s why he came himself．He procured what he wanted and paid for it，and the huckster and his wife both nodded a“good evening”to him；and the woman was one who could do more than merely nod——she had an immense power of tongue！And the student nodded too，and then suddenly stood still，reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped．It was a leaf torn out of an old book，a book that ought not to have been torn up，a book that was full of poetry．\\n\\n “There lies more of it，”said the huckster：“I gave an old woman a few coffee beans for it；give me three pence and you shall have the remainder．”\\n\\n “Thanks，” said the student，“give me the book in－stead of the cheese：I can eat my bread and butter without cheese．It would be a sin to tear the book up entirely．You are a capital man，a practical man，but you under－stand no more about poetry than does that cask yonder．”\\n\\n Now，that was an impolite speech，especially to－wards the cask；but the huckster laughed and the student laughed，for it was only said in fun．But the Goblin was angry that any one should dare to say such things to a huckster who lived in his own house and sold the best butter．\\n\\n When it was night，and the shop was closed and all were in bed except the student，the Goblin came forth，went into the bedroom，and took away the good lady\u0027s tongue；for she did not want that while she was asleep；and whenever he put this tongue upon any object in the room，the said object acquired speech and language，and could express its thoughts and feelings as well as the lady herself could have done；but only one object could use it at a time，and that was a good thing，otherwise they would have interrupted each other．\\n\\n And the Goblin laid the tongue upon the Cask in which the old newspapers were lying．\\n\\n “Is it true，”he asked，“that you don\u0027t know what poetry means？”\\n\\n “Of course！I know it，”replied the Cask：“poetry is something that always stands at the foot of a column in the newspapers，and is sometimes cut out．I dare swear I have more of it in me than the student，and I\u0027m only a poor tub compared to the huckster．”\\n\\n Then the Goblin put the tongue upon the coffee－mill，and，mercy！how it began to go！And he put it upon the butter－cask，and on the cashbox：they were all of the wastepaper Cask\u0027s opinion，and the opinion of the majority must be respected．\\n\\n “Now I shall tell it to the student！”\\n\\n And with these words the Goblin went quite quietly up the back stairs to the garret，where the student lived．The student had still a candle burning，and the Goblin peeped through the keyhole，and saw that he was reading in the torn book from downstairs．\\n\\n But how light it was in his room！Out of the book shot a clear beam，expanding into a thick stem，and into a mighty tree，which grew upward and spread its branches far over the student．Each leaf was fresh，and every blossom was a beautiful girl\u0027s head，some with dark sparkling eyes，others with wonderfully clear blue orbs；every fruit was a gleaming star，and there was a glorious sound of song in the student\u0027s room．\\n\\n Never had the little Goblin imagined such splendour，far less had he ever seen or heard anything like it．He stood still on tiptoe，and peeped in till the light went out in the student\u0027s garret．Probably the student blew it out，and went to bed；but the little Goblin remained standing there nevertheless，for the music still sounded on，soft and beautiful——a splendid cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest．\\n\\n {ewc MVIMAGE,MVIMAGE, !413493T1.bmp}\\n\\n “This is an incomparable place，”said the Goblin：“I never expected such a thing！I should like to stay here with the student．”\\n\\n And then he thought it over——and thought sensibly；then he sighed，“The student has no porridge！”And then he went down again to the huckster\u0027s shop：and it was a very good thing that he got down there again at last，for the Cask had almost worn out the good woman\u0027s tongue，for it had spoken out at one side everything that was contained in it，and was just about turning itself over，to give it out from the other side also，when the Goblin came in，and restored the tongue to its owner．But from that time forth the whole shop，from the cashbox down to the fire-wood，took its tone from the Cask，and paid him such respect，and thought so much of him，that when the huckster afterwards read the critical articles on theatricals and art in the newspaper，they were persuaded the information came from the Cask itself．\\n\\n But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly and contentedly listening to all the wisdom down there：as soon as the light glimmered from the garret in the evening，he felt as if the rays were strong cables drawing him up，and he was obliged to go and peep through the keyhole；and there a feeling of greatness rolled around him，such as we feel beside the ever－heaving sea when the storm rushes over it，and he burst into tears！He did not know himself why he was weeping，but a peculiar feeling of pleasure mingled with his tears！How wonderfully glorious it must be to sit with the student under the same tree！But that might not be——he was obliged to be content with the view through the keyhole，and to be glad of that．\\n\\n There he stood on the cold landing－place，with the autumn wind blowing down from the loft－hole：it was cold，very cold；but the little mannikin only felt that when the light in the room was extinguished and the tones in the tree died away．Ha！then he shivered，and crept down again to his warm corner，where it was homely and comfortable．And when Christmas came，and brought with it the porridge and the great lump of butter，why，then he thought the huckster the better man．\\n\\n But in the middle of the night the Goblin was awakened by a terrible tumult and knocking against the window－shutters．People rapped noisily without，and the watchman blew his horn，for a great fire had broken out——the whole street was full of smoke and flame．Was it in the house it-self or at a neighbour\u0027s？Where was it？Terror seized on all．\\n\\n The huckster\u0027s wife was so bewildered that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket，that at any rate she might save something；the huckster ran up for his share－papers，and the maid for her black silk mantilla，for she had found means to purchase one．Each wanted to save the best thing they possessed；the Goblin wanted to do the same thing，and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and into the room of the student，who stood quite quietly at the open window，looking at the conflagration that was raging in the house of the neighbour opposite．The Goblin seized upon the wonderful book which lay upon the table，popped it into his red cap，and held the cap tight with both hands．The best treasure of the house was saved；and now he ran up and away，quite on to the roof of the house，on to the chimney．There he sat，illuminated by the flames of the burning house opposite，both hands pressed tightly over his cap，in which the treasure lay；and now he knew the real feelings of his heart，and knew to whom it really belonged．But when the fire was extinguished，and the Goblin could think calmly again，why，then…\\n\\n “I must divide myself between the two，”he said；“I can\u0027t quite give up the huckster，because of the porridge！”\\n\\n Now，that was spoken quite like a human creature．We all of us visit the huckster for the sake of the porridge．\\n\\n 小鬼和小商人\\n\\n \\n\\n 从前有一个名副其实的学生：他住在一间顶楼里，什么也没有；同时有一个名副其实的小商人，住在第一层楼上，拥有整幢房子。一个小鬼就跟这个小商人住在一起，因为在这儿，在每个圣诞节的前夕，他总能得到一盘麦片粥吃，里面还有一大块黄油！这个小商人能够供给这点东西，所以小鬼就住在他的店里，而这件事是富有教育意义的。\\n\\n 有一天晚上，学生从后门走进来，给自己买点蜡烛和干奶酪。他没有人为他跑腿，因此才亲自来买。他买到了他所需要的东西，也付了钱。小商人和他的太太对他点点头，表示祝他晚安。这位太太能做的事情并不止点头这一项——她还有会讲话的天才！\\n\\n 学生也点了点头。接着他忽然站着不动，读起包干奶酪的那张纸上的字来了。这是从一本旧书上撕下的一页纸。这页纸本来是不应该撕掉的，因为这是一部很旧的诗集。\\n\\n “这样的书多的是！”小商人说。“我用几粒咖啡豆从一个老太婆那儿换来的。你只要给我三个铜板，就可以把剩下的全部拿去。”\\n\\n “谢谢，”学生说，“请你给我这本书，把干奶酪收回去吧；我只吃黄油面包就够了。把一整本书撕得乱七八糟，真是一桩罪过。你是一个能干的人，一个讲究实际的人，不过就诗说来，你不会比那个桶懂得更多。”\\n\\n 这句话说得很没有礼貌，特别是用那个桶作比喻；但是小商人大笑起来，学生也大笑起来，因为这句话不过是开开玩笑罢了。但是那个小鬼却生了气：居然有人敢对一个卖最好的黄油的商人兼房东说出这样的话来。\\n\\n 黑夜到来了，店铺关上了门；除了学生以外，所有的人都上床去睡了。这时小鬼就走进来，拿起小商人的太太的舌头，因为她在睡觉的时候并不需要它。只要他把这舌头放在屋子里的任何物件上，这物件就能发出声音，讲起话来，而且还可以像太太一样，表示出它的思想和感情。不过一次只能有一件东西利用这舌头，而这倒也是一桩幸事，否则它们就要彼此打断话头了。\\n\\n 小鬼把舌头放在那个装旧报纸的桶里。“有人说你不懂得诗是什么东西，”他问，“这话是真的吗？”\\n\\n “我当然懂得，”桶说；“诗是一种印在报纸上补白的东西，可以随便剪掉不要。我相信，我身体里的诗要比那个学生多得多；但是对小商人说来，我不过是一个没有价值的桶罢了。”\\n\\n 于是小鬼再把舌头放在一个咖啡磨上。哎唷！咖啡磨简直成了一个话匣子了！于是他又把舌头放在一个黄油桶上，然后又放到钱匣子上——它们的意见都跟桶的意见一样，而多数人的意见是必须尊重的。\\n\\n “好吧，我要把这意见告诉那个学生！”\\n\\n 于是小鬼就静悄悄地从一个后楼梯走上学生所住的那间顶楼。房里还点着蜡烛。小鬼从门锁孔里朝里面偷看。他瞧见学生正在读他从楼下拿去的那本破书。\\n\\n 但是这房间里是多么亮啊！那本书里冒出一根亮晶晶的光柱。它扩大成为一根树干，变成了一株大树。它长得非常高，而且它的枝丫还在学生的头上向四面伸展开来。每片叶子都很新鲜，每朵花儿都是一个美女的面孔：脸上的眼睛有的乌黑发亮，有的蓝得分外晶莹。每一个果子都是一颗明亮的星；此外，房里还有美妙的歌声［和音乐］。\\n\\n 嗨！这样华丽的景象是小鬼从没有想到过的，更谈不上看见过或听到过了。他踮着脚尖站在那儿，望了又望，直到房里的光灭掉为止。也许学生把灯吹熄，上床睡觉去了。但是小鬼仍旧站在那儿，因为音乐还没有停止，声音既柔和，又美丽；对于躺着休息的学生说来，它真算得是一支美妙的催眠曲。\\n\\n “这地方真是无与伦比！”小鬼说。“这真是出乎我的想象之外！我倒很想跟这学生住在一起哩。”\\n\\n 接着他很有理智地考虑了一下，叹了一口气：“这学生可没有粥给我吃！”所以他仍然走下楼来，回到那个小商人家里去了。他回来得正是时候，因为那个桶几乎把太太的舌头用烂了：它已经把身子这一面所装的东西全都讲完了，现在它正打算翻转身来把另一面再讲一通。正在这时候，小鬼来到了，把这舌头拿走，还给了太太。不过从这时候起，整个的店——从钱匣一直到木柴——都随声附和桶了。它们尊敬它，五体投地地佩服它，弄得后来店老板晚间在报纸上读到艺术和戏剧批评文章时，它们都相信这些消息是桶提供的。\\n\\n 但是小鬼再也没有办法安安静静、心满意足地坐着，听它们卖弄智慧和学问了。不成，只要顶楼上一有灯光射出来，他就觉得这些光线好像就是锚索，硬要把他拉上去，他不得不爬上去，把眼睛贴着那个小钥匙孔朝里面望。它胸中起了一种豪迈的感觉，就像我们站在波涛汹涌的、正受暴风雨袭击的大海旁边一样。他不禁凄然泪下！他自己也不知道他为什么要流眼泪，不过他在流泪的时候却有一种幸福之感：跟学生一起坐在那株树下该是多么幸福啊！然而这是做不到的事情——他能在小孔里看一下也就很满足，很高兴了。\\n\\n 他站在寒冷的楼梯上；秋风从阁楼的圆窗吹进来。天气变得非常冷了。不过，只有当顶楼上的灯灭了和树上的音乐停止了的时候，这个小矮子才开始感觉到冷。嗨！这时他就颤抖起来，爬下楼梯，回到他那个温暖的角落里去了。那儿很舒服和安适！\\n\\n 圣诞节来了，随之而来的是粥和一大块黄油——的确，这时他体会到小商人是他的主人。\\n\\n 不过半夜的时候，小鬼被窗扉上一阵可怕的敲击声惊醒了。外面有人在大喊大叫。守夜人在吹号角，因为发生了大火灾——整条街上都是一片火焰。火是在自己家里烧起来的呢，还是在隔壁房里烧起来的呢？究竟是在什么地方烧起来的呢？大家都陷入恐怖中。\\n\\n 小商人的太太给弄糊涂了，连忙扯下耳朵上的金耳环，塞进衣袋，以为这样总算救出了一点东西。小商人则忙着去找他的股票，女佣人跑去找她的黑绸披风——因为这件衣服是她好不容易才攒钱买到的。每个人都想救出自己最好的东西。小鬼当然也是这样。他几步就跑到楼上，一直跑进学生的房里。学生正泰然自若地站在一个开着的窗子面前，眺望着对面那幢房子里的熊熊火焰。小鬼把放在桌上的那本奇书抢过来，塞进自己的小红帽里，同时用双手紧紧捧着帽子。现在这一家的最好的宝物总算救出来了！所以他就赶快逃跑，一直跑到屋顶上，跑到烟囱上去。他坐在那儿，对面那幢房子的火光照着他——他双手紧紧抱着那顶藏有宝贝的帽子。现在他知道他心里的真正感情，知道他的心真正向着谁了。不过等到火被救熄以后，等到他的头脑冷静下来以后——嗨……\\n\\n “我得把我分给两个人，”他说。“为了那碗粥，我不能舍弃那个小商人！”\\n\\n 这话说得很近人情！我们大家也到小商人那儿去——为了我们的粥。\\n\\n \\n\\n 这篇作品发表在《故事集》第二辑里。这里所谈到的问题就是文艺——具体地说，诗——与物质利益的关系。小鬼从锁孔里偷看到，那个学生正在读的那本破书——诗集——中长出了青枝绿叶的树，开出了花朵——“每朵花儿都是一个美女的面孔：脸上的眼睛有的乌黑发亮，有的蓝得分外晶莹。”这情景真是美妙极了。小鬼心里想：“我倒很想跟这学生住在一起哩。”但一回到现实中来，他住楼底下那个小商人的屋子里却保证了他有饭吃——那个穷学生可没有这种能力。于是，他只好“把我分给两个人，为了那碗粥，我不能舍弃那个小商人。”故事的结论是：“这话说得很近人情！”\\n\\n
