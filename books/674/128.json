{"id":28136,"no":128,"title":"THE PORTER\u0027 S SON","content":"THE General\u0027 s family lived on the first floor； thePorter\u0027s lived in the cellar； there was a great distance be－tween the twofamilies—the whole of the ground－floor，and thedifference inrank； buttheylivedunderthe same roof， and had thesame outlook to thestreet and theyard． Inthe yardtherewasa grass－plotwith a flowering acacia tree— when itdid flower；and under it sat sometimes the smartly- dressed nurse， with the stillmore smartly－dressed child，the General\u0027 s，\"Little Emily． Before them thePorter\u0027s little boy，with the brown eyesanddark hair， used to dance on his bare feet， and the child laughed， andstretched out her little hands to him，and when the General saw it from his window， he nodded down to them， and said，\"Charming！\" The General\u0027s lady， who was so young thatshe could almost havebeenhis daughter by an earlier marriage， never looked out to the yard， but had given or-ders that the cellar－folks\u0027 littleboy might play for the child， butmust not touch it． Thenursekept strictly tothelady\u0027sorders. And the sun shone in upon the people in the first floor， and upon those in the cellar； the acacia tree put forth its blossoms， theyfelloff，and new ones came again nextyear；thetreebloomed，andthePorter\u0027slittleboy bloomed， he looked like a fresh tulip． The General\u0027sdaughter grew delicate and pale，like the pink leaf of the acacia flower． She seldom came down now under the tree；she took herfresh air in the carriage． She drove out with Mamma， and she always nodded to the Porter\u0027s little George， even kissedher fingers to him， until her mother told herthat she was nowtoobigforthat． One forenoon he went up to the General\u0027s with the letters and papers which had been left in the Porter\u0027s lodge in the morning. As he went upstairs, past the door of the sand-hole, he heard something whimpering inside; he thought it was a chicken chirping there, but insteaditwastheGeneral\u0027s little daughter in muslin and lace． \"Don\u0027t tell Papa and Mamma，for they will beangry！\" \"What is the matter， little miss？\" asked George. \"It is all burning！\" said she．\" It is burning andblazing！\" George opened the door to the little nursery： thewindow curtain was almost all burned， the curtain rod wasglowing and in flames． Georgesprang up， pulled it down， and called to the people． But for him there would havebeen a house on fire． The General and his lady questioned little Emily．\" I only took one sin- glematch，\"said she，\"that burned at once， and the curtain burned at once. I spat to put it out， Ispat as hard asI could， butI could not spit enough，and slIran outandhidmy－ self， for Papa and Mamma would be so angry．\" \"spit！\"said the General， \"what kind of a word is that？ When did you hear Papa or Mamma say \u0027spit\u0027？ You have got that from downstairs．\" But little George got a penny．This did not go to the baker， itwent into the savings box； and soon there were so many shillings， that he could buy himself a paint－boxto paint his drawings； and of these he had many． Theyseemed to come out of his pencil and his finger-ends．He presented his first paintings to little Emily． \"Charming！\" said the General； the lady herself ad－mitted that one could distinctly seewhatthelittle one had meant．\"He has Genius!\" These were the words that the Porter\u0027s wife brought down into the cellar． The General and his wife werepeople of rank： theyhad two coats of arms on their carriage； onefor eachofthem． The lady had hers on every piece of clothing， out－side and inside， on her night－cap，andnight－dress bag．Hers was an expensive one，bought by her father for shin-ing dollars；for he had not been born with it， nor she ei－ther；shehadcome too early，seven years before the coat of arms. Most people could remember that， but not the family．The General\u0027 s coat of arms was old and big： itmightwellmake one\u0027s bones crack to carry it， to say noth- ingoftwo such coats， andher ladyship\u0027s boned cracked when， stiff and stately， she drove to a court-ball． The General was old and grey， but looked well onhorseback． He knew that， and he rode out every day with agroomat a respectful distance behind him．When he came toaparty，itwasasif he came riding on his high horse, and he had so many orders that it was inconceivable；but that was not his fault at all．When quite a young man he had served in the army，had been at the great autumn ma－neuvers，which thenwere held by the troops in the days ofpeace．About that time he had an anecdote， the only one hehad to tell．His under-officer cut off and took prisoneroneofthe princes； and thePrince with his little troop ofcaptured soldiers， himself a prisoner， had toride into thetown behind the General．Itwas an event not tobe forgot－ten， which always，throughall the years， was re-told bythe General，withjust the same memorable words which he hadusedwhenheretumedthePrince\u0027ssabretohim， \"Only my subaltern couldhave taken your Highness prison-er，Inever！\"and the Prince answered，\"You are incompa- rable！\" The General had neverbeen in areal war；when thatwent through the land， hewent on the diplomatic path， through three foreigncourts．He spoke theFrench language，sothathealmost forgothisown；he danced well， he rode well，orders grew on his coat in profusion；sentinels presented arms to him， and one of the most beau－tiful young girls presented herself to him and became hiswife，andthey had a charming baby，whichseemed to have fallen down from Heaven， it was so lovely， and the Porter\u0027ssondancedintheyardforher，assoonasshecouldtake notice， and gave her all his coloured pictures， and shelooked at them， and was delighted with them， and tore them to pieces．She was sofine and so charming！ \"My rose－leaf，\" said the General\u0027s lady，\"you areborn for a Prince！\" The Prince already stood outside the door；but they did not know it． People cannot see very far beyond the door－step． \"The other day， our boy shared his bread and butterwith her，\" said the porter\u0027s wife；\"there was neithercheese nor meat on it， but she enjoyed it as if it had beenroast－beef．\" The General\u0027s People would have broughtthe house down if they had seen that feast， but they didn\u0027t see it． George had shared his bread and butter with little Emily ； he would willingly have shared his heart with her，if it would have pleased her．He was a good boy，he was clever and sprightly， he now went to the evening class at the Academy， to learn to draw properly． Little Emily alsomade progress in learning；she talked French with hernurse， and had a dancing－master． \"George will be confirmed at Easter，\" said the Porter\u0027s wife．George was now so far advancde ． \"It would be sensible to put him to a trade，\" saidthe father—\"a nice trade it should be， of course， and sowe should have him out of the house．\" \"He will have to sleep at home at night，\" said themother；\"it is not easy to find a master who has room forhim to sleep； clothes，too，we must give him；the littlebit of food he eats is easily got，he is quite happy withone or two boiled potatoes； he has free education too．Just let him go his own way， you will see that he will bea pleasure to us； the Professor said so．\" The confirmation clothes were ready． The motherherself had sewed them， but they were cut out by the job-bing tailor， and he cut well． If he had only been in abetter position， and had been able to have a workshop and workmen， said the Porter\u0027s wife，he might very well have been court-tailor． The confirmation clothes were ready， and the confir－mant was ready．On the confirmation day George got a large pinchbeck watch from his godfather，the flax-dealer\u0027sold workman， the richest of George\u0027s godfathers．The watch was old and tried； it always went fast，but that is better than going slow．It was a costly present；and fromthe General\u0027 s came a Psalm－book，bound in morocco， sentfrom the little lady to whom George had presented his pie－tures．In the front of the book stood his name and her name and \"earnest well-wishes\"． It was written from the dictationof the General\u0027s lady， and the General had read it throughand said，\"Charming！\" \"It was really a great attention from such grand gen－tlefolk，\" said the Porter\u0027s wife； and George had to go upin his confirmation clothes and with the Psalm－book， toshow himself and return thanks． The General\u0027s lady was much wrapped up， and hadone of her bad headaches，which she alwayshad when she was tired of things．She looked kindly at George， andwishedhim everything good and never to have her headaches． The General was in his dressing－gown， and wore a tassllea cap and red-topped Russian boots．He went up and down the floor three times in thoughts and memories of his own，stood still， and said， \"So little George is now a Christian man？ Let him be also an honest man ，and honour his superiors． Some day， as an old man， you can say that the General taught you that sentence！\" This was a longer speech than he usually made， andhe returned again to his meditation and looked dignified．But of all that George heard or saw up there， he kept most clearly in his thoughts the little Miss Emily； how charmingshe was， how gentle， how light， and how fragile！ If shewas to be painted， it must be in a soap－bubble． There wasa fragrance about her clothes， about her curly， goldenhair ， as if she was a fresh－blossomed rose－tree；and withher he had once shared his bread and butter！She had eat－ en it with a hearty appetite，and nodded to him at every other mouthful． Could she remember it still？ Yes， certain－ly； she had given him the beautiful Psalm-book\"in memo－ ry\"of it；and then the first time the New Year\u0027s new moon was seen， he went outside with bread and a farthing， andopened the book to see what Psalm he would light upon． It was apsalm of praise and thanksgiving ；and he opened itagain to see what would be granted to little Emily．He took care not to dip into the book where the funeral hymnswere， and yet he opened it between Death and the Grave．This was nothing to put faith in， and yet he was fright-ened when the dainty little girl was soon laid up in bed，and the doctor\u0027s carriage stopped outside the gate everynoon． \"They won\u0027t keep her！\" said the Porter\u0027s wife；\"our Lord knows well whom He will have！\" But they did keep her；and George drew pictures and sent them to her；he drew the Castle of the Czar，theold Kremlin in Moscow， exactly as it stood， with towersand cupolas；they looked like gigantic green and goldencucumbers， at least in George\u0027s drawings．They pleasedlittle Emily so much， and therefore， in the course of a week，George sent a few more pictures， all of them build－ings，because with them she could imagine so much insidethe doors and windows． He drew a Chinese house， withbells throughout all the sixteen stories；he drew two Greektemples， with slender marble pillars， and steps round about；he drew a Norwegian church； one could see that itwas made entirely of timber， carved and wonderfully setup， every story looked as if it were on cradle－rockers．Most beautiful of all， however， was one drawing， a cas－tle，which he called\" Little Emily\u0027s．\" In such a oneshould she live； George had completely thought it out，and had taken for that castle everything that he thought most beautiful in the other buildings． It had carved beamslike the Norwegian church， marble pillars like the Greektemple， bells in every story， and at the top of all， cupo－las，green and gilded，like those on the Czar\u0027s Kremlin．It was a real child\u0027s castle， and under each window waswritten what the room or hall was to be used for：\"HereEmily sleeps．\"\"Here Emily dances，\" and\"Here Emily plays at receiving visitors．\"It wat amusing to see， and itwas looked at too． \"Charming！\" said the General． But the old Count， for there was an old Count， whowas still more dignified than the General， and himself hada castle and an estate， said nothing； he heard that it wasdesigned and drawn by the Porter\u0027s littleson．He was notso little， however， seeing that he was confirmed． The oldCount looked at the pictures，and had his own quiet thoughts about them． One day， when the weather was downright grey，wet，and horrid，was one of the brightest andbest forlittle George．The Professor of the Academy of Art called him in． \"Listen， my friend，\" said he，\"let us have some talktogether！ God has been very good to you with abilities；Heis also good to you with good people． The old Count at thecornerhas spoken to me about you； Ihave also seen your pictures ；we will draw the pencil over them； in them thereis much to correct！Now you can come twice a week to the drawing school， and you will be able to do better after－wards． I believe there is more inyou to make an architectthan a painter； you can have time to consider that yourself；but today you must go up to the old Count at the corner， and thank our Lord for such a man！\" It was a great house at the corner； round the windowswere carved elephants and dromedaries，all from olden times； but the old Count thought most of the new times with whatgood they brought， whether it came from the firstfloor， the cellar， orthe garret． \"I believe，\" said the Porter\u0027s wife，\"that the morefolks are really grand， the less stuck－up they are！ Howcharming and straightforward the old Count is！ And hespeaks just like you and me！The General\u0027s people can\u0027tdo that． Was George not quite wild with delight yesterday，over the delightful treatment he got from the Count；and to-day Iam the same after having spoken with the great man．Isit not agood thing now， that we did not apprentice George to a trade？He has abilities．\" \"But they must have help from outside， said the fa-ther． \"He has got that now，\"said the mother，\"the Count said it clearly and distinctly．\" \"It is from the General\u0027s， though． That it was all setgoing！\" said the father．\"We must also thank them．\" \"That we can well do，\"said the mother，\"butIdon\u0027tbelieve there is much to thank them for；Iwill thank ourLord， andI will also thank Him because the little Emily iscoming to herself again！\" Emily kept getting on， andGeorge kept getting on； in the course of the year he gotthe little silver medal， and afterwards the bigger one． \"It would have been better if he had been put to a trade，\" said the mother， and wept；\"Then we should have kept him！ What shall he do in Rome？ I shall neversee him again， even if he comes home， but he won\u0027t do that， the sweet child！\" \"But it is his good fortune and his glory！\"said thefather． \"Yes， thank you， my friend，\" said the mother， \"but you don\u0027t mean what you say！ YOu are as much dis－tressed as I am！\" And it was true， both about the grief and the goingaway． Everybody said it was great good fortune for theyoung fellow！ And parting visits were paid，including one to theGeneral\u0027s； but the lady did not show herself， she had oneof her headaches． By way of farewell the General told hisonly anecdote， about what he had said to the Prince， andwhat the Prince said to him，\"You are incomparable！\"Then he gave George his hand—his flabby hand ； Emilyalso gave George her hand and looked almost distressed，but George was the most distressed of all． Time goes when one is doing something； it goes alsowhen one is doing nothing． The time is equally long，butnot equally profitable．For George it was profitable， andnot at all long， except when he thought those at home． How were they getting on upstairs and downstairs？Well， he got news of them； and one can put so much in aletter， both the bright sunshine， and the dark， heavydays． They lay in the letter， which told that the fatherwas dead， and only the mother was left behind． Emilyhad been like an angel of comfort； she had come down toher， the mother wrote， and added that she herself had gotleave to keep the employment at the gate． The General\u0027s lady kept a diary； in it was recordedevery party， every ball， she had gone to， and all the visi-tors she had received．The diary was illustrated with thevisiting cards of diplomats and the highest nobility． Shewas proud of her diary；it grew for many a day， during many big headaches， and also during many brilliantnights，that is to say， court－balls． Emily had been at a court-ball for the first time． Themother was dressed in pink with black lace；Spanish！Thedaughter in white，so clear，so fine！green ribbons flut－tered－like leaves of sedge amongst her curly， golden hair，which bore a crown of water－lilies． Her eyes were so blueand so clear， her mouth so small and red， she looked like a little mermaid， as lovdy as can be imagined． Three princes danced with her， that is to say， first one and thenanother；the General\u0027s lady did not have a headache for a week． But the first ball was not the last one； it was all toomuch for Emily， and it was a good thing that the summercame with its rest and fresh air． The family was invited to the old Count\u0027s castle．It was a castle with a garden worthseeing． One part of it was quite as in olden days，withstiff，green hedges， where one seemed to go between green screens， inwhich there were peep－holes．Box-trees and yew－trees were clipped into stars and pyramids；water sprang from great grottoes， set with cockle－shells： roundabout stood stone figures of the very heaviest stone， one could see that by the clothes and the faces； everyflower－ bed had its shape of a fish， shield， or monogram； that wasthe French part of the garden． From there one came， as it were， into the fresh open wood， where the trees dared togrow as they would， and were therefore so big and so beau－ tiful．The grass was green， and good for walking on ； it wasrolled，mowed， and well kept； that was the English part ofthe garden． \"Olden times and modem times，\" said the Count，\"here they glide well into each other！ In about two years the house itselfwillget its proper appearance． Itwill un－ dergo a complete change to something better and more beautiful． I shall show you the plans， andI shall show youthe architect． He is here today for dinner！\" \"Charming！\" said the General． \"It is like Paradise here！\" said her ladyship，\"andthere you have abaronial castle！\" \"That is my hen-house，\" said the count．\"The pi- geons live in the tower， the turkeys on the first floor， buton the ground floor oldDame Elsie rules．She has guest－ chambers on all sides：the sitting－hens by themselves， thehen with chickens by herself， and the ducks have their own outlet to the water！\" \"Charming！\" repeated the General， and they all went to see this fine show． Old Elsie stood in the middle of the room， and by the side of her was George， the architect； he and little Emily met after many years， met in the hen－housc． Yes，there he stood， and he was nice enough to look at； hisface open and decided， with black glossy hair，and on his lips a smile which said，\"There sits a rogue behind my ear who knows you outside and in．\" Old Elsie had taken her wooden shoes off， and stood on her stocking soles， in honour of the distinguished guests． And the hens cackled，and the cock crew， and the ducks waddled away with \"quack， quack ！\" But the pale，slender girl， the friend ofhis childhood，the General\u0027s daughter，stood there with a rosy tinge on the otherwise pale cheeks；her eyes becameso big，and her mouth spoke without saying a single word，and the greeting he got was the prettiest any young man could wish for from a young lady， if they were not related or had never danced much together；she and the architect had never danced with each other． The Count shook hands with him，and presented him：\"Our young friend， Mr．George， is not quite a stranger．\" Her ladyship curtsied， the daughter was about to give him her hand， but she did not give it．\" Our littleMr．George！\" said the General，\"old house－friends ； charming！\" \"You have become quite an Italian，\"said her lady－ship，\"and you talk the language like a native，I sup－pose．\" Her ladyship sang Italian， but did not speak it， theGeneral said． At the dinner-table George sat at Emily\u0027s right hana． The General had taken her in， the Count had taken in her ladyship． Mr．George talked and told anecdotes， and he toldthem well； he was the life and soul of the party， althoughthe old Count could have been that too．Emily sat silent； her ears heard， and her eyes shone， but she said nothing． Afterwards she and George stood in the verandah amongst the flowers； a hedge of roses hid them．George was again the first to speak． \"Thank you for your kindness to my old mother！\"said he；\"Iknowthatthe night my fatherdied， you camedown to her， and stayed with her till his eyes wereclosed．Thanks！\" He caught Emily\u0027s hand and kissed it；he might do that on this occasion．She blushed rosy－red，but pressed his hand again and looked at him with hertenderblue eyes． \"Your mother was a lovingsoul！ How fond she wasof you！ And she let me read all your letters；I believeIalmost know you！ How kind you were to me whenI was little；you gave me pictures—\" \"Which you tore in pieces！\" said George． \"No！ Ihave still my castle，—the drawing of it．\" \"And nowI must build it in reality！\" said George，and grew quite hot with what he said． The General and her ladyship talked in their ownroom about the Porter\u0027s son； he knew how to comporthimself， and could express himself with knowledge andintelligence．\"He could be a tutor！\" said the General． \"Genius！\"said her ladyship， and she said no more． Often in the lovely summer-time Mr． George came tothe castle of the Count． He was missed when he did notcome． \"How much more God has given to you than to us other poor creatures！\" said Emily to him．\"Do you realizethat properly？\" It flattered George that the lovely young girl lookedup to him，and he thought her uncommonly gifted．Andthe General felt himself more and more convinced thatMr． George could not possibly be a child of the cellar． \"The mother was， however， a very honest woman，\"said he；\"Iowe that to her memory．\" The summer went and the winter came， and therewas more talk about Mr．George； he had been receivedwith favour in the highest places．The General had methim at a court-ball． And now there was to be a ball in thehouse for little Emily． Could Mr． George be invited？ \"Whom the king invites，the General can invite，\"said the General， and lifted himself a whole inch from thefloor． Mr．George was invited， and he came；and princes and counts came， and the one danced better than the oth－er； but Emily could only dance the first dance． In it shesprained her foot， not badly， but enough to feel it； so shehad to be careful，stop dancing， and look at the others；and she sat and looked， and the architect stood by herside： \"You are surely giving her the whole of St． Peter\u0027s！\"said the General， as he went past， and smiled like benevolence itself． With the same benevolent smile he received Mr． George some days after． The young man certainly came to call after the ball，what else ？Yes，the most as- tounding， the most astonishing thing；he came with in－sane words； the General could not believe his ownears； a perfectly incredible proposal，—Mr． George asked for little Emily as his wife！ \"Man！\"said the General，and began to boil．\"I don\u0027t understand you in the least！ What do you say？ What do you want？ I don \u0027t know you！ Sir！ Fellow！ itcomes into your head to come like this into my house！ Am I to be here，or am I not to be here？\"and he went backwards into his bedroom and locked the door， leav－ ing George standing alone． He stood for some minutes， and then turned about to go． In the corridor stood Emily． \"My father answered—？\" she asked， and her voice trembled． George pressed her hand．\"He ran from me！ — there is abetter time coming！\" There were tears in Emily\u0027s eyes； in those of theyoung man were courage and confidence；and the sun shone in upon the two and gave them his blessing． In his room sat the General， perfectly boiling； in fact he boiled over and sputtered out，\"Madness！ Porter\u0027s madness！\"— Before an hour had passed， the General\u0027s lady got it from the General\u0027s own mouth， and she called for Emily and sat alone with her． \"You poor child！to insult you so！ to insult us！ Youhave tears in your eyes， but it suits you！You are charmingin tears！ You resemble me on my wedding－day． Cry away，little Emily！\" \"Yes，that I must，\" said Emily，\"if you and fatherdon\u0027t say\u0027Yes！\u0027\" \"Child！\"cried herladyship，\"youareill！youtalkin delirium， andI am getting my frightful headache！ to thinkof all the unhappiness which comes to ourhouse！Do not beyour mother\u0027s death， Emily．Then you will have no moth－er！\" And her ladyship\u0027s eyes grew wet； she could not bearto think of her own death． In the newspaper one read amongst the appointments ：\"Mr．George，appointed Professor．\" \"It is a pityhis parents are in their grave and cannotreadit！ saidthe new porter－folk， who nowlivedinthe cellar， under the General\u0027s； they knew that the Professorhad been born and brought up within their four walls． \"Now he will come in for paying the tax on titles，\"said the man． \"Yes， is it not a great deal for a poor child，\" saidthe wife． \"Forty shillings in the year！\" said the man，\"yes，that is a lot of money！\" \"No，I mean the position！\"said the wife．\"Do yousuppose he will trouble himself about the money； he canearn that many times over； and he will， no doubt， get arich wife besides． If we had children， they should also bearchitects and professors．\" George was well spoken of in the cellar，he was wellspoken of on the first floor；even the old Count conde－ scended to do so． It was the pictures from his childhood days which gave occasion for it． But why were they mentioned？ Theywere talking about Russia， and aboutMoscow， and so of course they came to the Kremlin， which little George hadonce drawn for little Emily；he had drawn so many pic－ tures！but one in particular， the Count remembered： littleEmily\u0027s castle， where she slept， where she danced， andplayed at\"receiving visitors\"．The Professor had much ability；he would certainly die an old Privy－Councillor， itwas not impossible，and before that he might have built a castle for the young lady； why not？ \"That was curious flight of fancy！\" observed her ladyship， when the Count had departed． The General shook his head thoughtfully， rode out with his groom at a respectful distance，and sat more proudly than ever on his high horse． It was little Emily\u0027s birthday； flowers and books，letters and cards， were brought； her ladyship kissed heron the mouth， the General on the forehead； they were affectionate parents， and both she and they had distinguished visitors—two of the Princes． There was talk about balls and theatres， about diplomatic embassies， the government of kingdoms and countries．There was talk of talent， native talent， and with that， the young Professor was brought into the conversation—Mr． George，the architect． \"He builds for immortality！\"it was said，\"he will certainly build himself into one of the first families， too！\" \"One of the first families？\"repeated the General to his lady afterwards；\"which one of our first families？\" \"Iknow which was meant，\" said her ladyship，\"but Iwill say nothing about it！ Iwill not even think it！ God ordains！ butI will be astonished！\" \"Let me also be astonished！\" said the General，\"I have not an idea in my head， and he sank into areverie． There is a power， an unspeakable power， in the fountain of favour from above，the favour of the court， orthe favour of God；—and all that gracious favour little George had． But we forget the birthday． Emily\u0027s room was fragrant with flowers from friends of both sexes，on the table lay lovely presents of greetingand remembrance， but not a single one from George；thatcould not come，but it was not needed either，the whole house was a remembrance of him． Even from the sand- hole under the stair a memorial flower peeped；there Emi－ly had hidden when the curtain was burnt， and Georgecame as first fire-engine ． A glance out of the window，andthe acacia tree reminded her of childhood\u0027s days．Flowersand leaves had fallen off，but the tree stood in the hoar－frost，as if it were a monster branch of coral， and the moonshone big and clear amongst branches，unchanged in all its changing， as when George shared his bread and but－ter with little Emily． From a drawer she took out the draw－ings of the Czar\u0027s castle， with her own castle，—keepsakesfrom George．They were looked at and mused upon， andmany thoughts arose； she remembered the day， when， un－observed by herfatherand mother，shewent down to the Porter\u0027s wife，who was lying at the point of death．She satbeside her and held her hand，and heard her last words，— \"Blessing—George！\"The mother thought of her son． Now Emily put her own meaning into the words． Yes，George was with her on her birthday，really with her！ The next day， it so happened， there was again a birthday in the house－the General\u0027s birthday；he wasborn the day after his daughter， but of course at an earlierdate， many years earlier． Again there came presents， andamongst them a saddle， of distinguished appearance，com－fortable and costly；there was only one of the princes whohad its equal．Who could it be from？ The General was de－lighted． A little card came with it． If it had said，\"Thanksfor yesterday，\"we could have guessed from whom it came；but on it was written，\"From one whom the General does not know！\" \"Who in the world doI not know？\" said the General． \"I know everybody！\" and his thoughts went into society； heknew every one there．\"It is from my wife，\" he said at last，\"she is making fun of me！ Charming！\" But she was not making fun of him； that time had gone past． And now there was a festival again， but not at theGeneral\u0027s；a costume ball at the house of one of theprinces． Masks were also allowed． The General went as Rubens， in a Spanish costume with a little ruff， a sword and stately bearing；her ladyshipas Madame， inblack velvet， high－necked， fright－ fully warm， with a mill－stone round her neck—that is tosay， a huge ruff， quite in accordance with a Dutch paint－ing which the General possessed， and in which the handsin perticular were much admired—they were quite like her ladyship\u0027s． Emily Psyche in muslin and lace． She was like a floating tuft of swan\u0027s－down：she had noneed of wings， she only them as sign of Psyche． There was splendour， magnificence， lights， and flowers，richness， and taste；there was so much to see， that noone noticed Madame Rubens\u0027s beautiful hands． A black domino， with acacia－blossoms in the hat，danced with Psyche． \"Who is he？\" asked her ladyship． \"His Royal Highness！\"said the General；\" Iamquite sure of it， Iknew him at once by his hand－shake．\" Her ladyship doubted． General Rubens had no doubts； he approached the black domino， and wrote royal initials on his hand；theywere denied， but a hint was given ；—\"The motto of thesaddle！ One whom the General does not know！\" \"ButI do know you， then！\" said the General．\"Youhave sent me the saddle．\" The domino lifted his hand， and disappearedamongst the others． \"Who is the black domino you were dancing with，Emily？\" asked the General\u0027s wife． \"I have not asked his name，\"she answered． \"Because you knewit！It is the Professor！Your Professo is here， Count，\"she continued， turning to theCount ，who stood close by．\"Black domino， with acacia-blossom！\" \"Very possibly ， my dear madam，\" answered he；\"but one of the princes is also wearing the same cos－tume．\" \"Iknow the hand-shake！\" said the Ceneral．\"The Prince sent me the saddle． Iam so certain of it， thatIshall invite him to dinner．\" \"Do so！ If it is the Prince，he will be sure to come，\"said the Count．\"And if it is the other，he will not come！\" said theGener－al，and approached the black domino，who was just then talking with the king． The General delivered a very re－spectful invitation，—\"so that they might get to know eachother．\"The General smiled in full confidence and certaintyof whom he was inviting； he spoke loudly and distinctly． The Domino raised his mask： it was George． \"Does the General repeat the invitation？\" asked he．The General drew himself an inch higher， assumed a stifferbearing， took two steps backwards， and one step forwards，as if in a minuet； and there was gravity and expression， asmuch of the General as could be expressed in his aristo－cratic face． \"Inever take back my word； the Professor is invit－ed，\" and he bowed with a glance at the King， who couldcertainly have heard the whole． And so there was a dinner at the General\u0027s， only theCount and his protégé were invited． \"The foot underthe table，\" thought George，\"then the foundation－stone is laid！ and the foundation－stone wasreally laid with great solemnity， by the General and her la-dyship． The person had come， and as the General knew and recognized， had talked quite like a man of good society，had been most interesting； the General had been obligedmany times to say his\"Charming！\" Her ladyship talked ofher dinner－party， talked of it even to one of the courtladies； and she， who was one of the most gifted， beggedfor an invitation the next time the Professor came． So hehad tobe invited again，and he was invited and came，andwas agaom charming；he could even play chess． \"He is not from the cellar！\" said the General，\"he isquite certainly of agood family！There are many of goodfamily， and the young man is not to blame for that．\" The Professor， who was admitted to the house of theKing，might well be allowed to enter the General\u0027s； but totake root in it，—there was no talk of that， except in thewhole town． He grew． The dew of grace fell from above！ It was therefore no surprise， that when the Professorbecame a privy Councillor， Emily became a Privy coun－ cillor\u0027s wife． \"Life is either a tragedy or a comedy，\"said the General．\"In tragedy they die， in comedy they marry eachother．\" Here they had each other． And they also had threestrong boys， but not all at once． The sweet children rode hobby－horses through the rooms and halls， when they were at Grandfather\u0027s andGrandmother\u0027s，and the General also rode on a hobby－horse behind them\"as groom for the little Privy－Council－lors！\" Her ladyship sat on the sofa and smiled，even if shehad her bad headac he． So far had George got on， and much farther too，else it would not have been worth while telling about the Porter\u0027s son． 看门人的儿子 将军的家住在第二层楼上；看门人的家住在地下室里。这两家的距离很远，整整相隔一层楼；而他们的地位也不同。不过他们是住在同一个屋顶下，面向着同一条街和同一个院子。院子里有一块草坪和一株开花的槐树——这就是说，当它开起花来的时候，在这树下面有时坐着一位穿得很漂亮的保姆和一位将军的穿得更漂亮的孩子“小小的爱米莉”。 那个有一对棕色大眼睛和一头黑发的看门人的孩子，常常在她们面前赤着脚跳舞。这位小姑娘对他大笑，同时把一双小手向他伸出来。将军在窗子里看到了这情景，就点点头，说：“好极了！”将军夫人很年轻，她几乎像他头一个太太生的女儿。她从来不朝院子里望，不过她下过一道命令说，住在地下室里的那家人家的孩子可以在她的女儿面前玩，但是不能碰她。保姆严格地执行太太的指示。 太阳照着住在第二层楼上的人，也照着住在地下室里的人。槐树开出花来了，而这些花又落了，第二年它们又开出来了。树儿开着花，看门人的小儿子也开着花——他的样子像一朵鲜艳的郁金香。 将军的女儿长得又嫩又白，像槐树花的粉红色花瓣。她现在很少到这株树底下来，她要呼吸新鲜空气时，就坐上马车；而且她出去时总是跟妈妈坐在一块。她一看到看门人的儿子乔治，就对他点点头，用手指飞一个吻，直到后来母亲告诉她说，她的年纪已经够大了，不能再做这类事儿。 有一天上午，他把门房里早晨收到的信件和报纸送给将军。当他爬上楼梯经过沙洞子的门的时候，听到里面有一种唧唧喳喳的声音。他以为里面有一只小鸡在叫，但是这却是将军的那个穿着花边洋布衣的小女儿。 “你不要告诉爸爸和妈妈，他们知道就会生气的！” “这是怎么回事，小姐？”乔治问。 “什么都烧起来了！”她说。“火烧得真亮！” 乔治把小育儿室的门推开；窗帘几乎都快要烧光了；挂窗帘的杆子也烧红了，在冒出火焰，乔治向上一跳就把它拉了下来，同时大声呼喊。要不是他，恐怕整个房子也要烧起来了。 将军和太太追问小爱米莉。 “我只是划了一根火柴，”她说，“但是它马上就燃起来了，窗帏也马上烧起来了。我吐出唾沫来想把它压熄，但是怎样吐也吐得不够多，所以我就跑出来，躲开了，因为怕爸爸妈妈生气。” “吐唾沫！”将军说， “这是一种什么字眼？你什么时候听到爸爸妈妈说过‘吐唾沫’的？你一定是跟楼底下的那些人学来的。” 但是小小的乔治得到了一个铜板。他没有把这钱在面包店里花掉，却把它塞进储藏匣里去。过了不久，他就有了许多银毫，够买一盒颜料。他开始画起彩色画来，并且确实画得不少。它们好像是从他的铅笔和指尖直接跳出来似的。他把他最初的几幅彩色画送给了小爱米莉。 “好极了！”将军说。将军夫人承认，人们一眼就可以看出这个小家伙的意图。“他有天才！”这就是看门人的妻子带到地下室来的一句话。 将军和他的夫人是有地位的人：他们的车子上绘着两个族徽——每一个代表一个家族。夫人的每件衣服上也有一个族徽，里里外外都是如此；便帽上也有，连睡衣袋上都有。她的旅徽是非常昂贵的，是她的父亲用锃亮的现洋买来的，因为他并不是一生下来就有它，她当然也不是一生下来就有它的：她生得太早，比族徽早7个年头。大多数的人都记得这件事情，但是这一家人却记不得。将军的族徽是又老又大：压在你的肩上可以压碎你的骨头——两个这样的族徽当然更不用说了。当夫人摆出一副生硬和庄严的架子去参加宫廷舞会的时候，她的骨头就曾经碎过。 将军是一个年老的人，头发有些灰白，不过他骑马还不坏。这点他自己知道，所以他每天骑马到外面去，而且叫他的马夫在后面跟他保持着相当的距离。因此他去参加晚会时总好像是骑着一匹高大的马儿似的。他戴着勋章，而且很多，把许多人都弄得莫名其妙，但是这不能怪他。他年轻的时候在军队中服过役，而且还参加过一次盛大的秋季演习——军队在和平时期所举行的演习。从那时起，他有一个关于自己的小故事——他常常讲的唯一的故事：他属下的一位军官在中途截获了一位王公。王公和他几个被俘的兵士必须骑着马跟在将军后面一同进城，王公自己也是一个俘虏。这真是一件难忘的事件。多少年来，将军一直在讲它，而且老是用那几个同样值得纪念的字眼来讲它：这几个字是他把那把剑归还给王公的时候说的：“只有我的部下才会把阁下抓来，作为俘虏；我本人决不会的！”于是王公回答说：“您是盖世无双的！” 老实讲，将军并没有参加过战争。当这国家遭遇到战争的时候，他却改行去办外交了；他先后到三个国家去当过使节。他的法文讲得很好，弄得他几乎把本国的语言也忘记掉了。他的舞也跳得很好，马也骑得很好；他上衣上挂的勋章多到不可想象的地步。警卫向他敬礼，一位非常漂亮的女子主动地要求作他的太太。他们生了一个很美丽的孩子。她好像是天上降下的一样，那么美丽。当她开始会玩的时候，看门人的孩子就在院子里跳舞给她看，还赠送许多彩色画给她。她把这些东西玩了一会儿，就把它们撕成碎片。她是那么美，那么可爱！ “我的玫瑰花瓣！”将军的夫人说，“你是为了一个王子而生下来的！” 那个王子已经站在他们的门口了，但是人们却不知道。人们的视线总是看不见自己门外的事情的。 “前天我们的孩子把黄油面包分给她吃，”看门人的妻子说；“那上面没有干奶酪，也没有肉，但是她吃得很香，好像那就是烤牛肉似的。将军家里的人如果看到这种食物一定会大闹一场的，但是他们没有看见。” 乔治把黄油面包分给小小的爱米莉吃。他连自己的心也愿意分给她呢，如果他这样就能使她高兴的话。他是一个好孩子，又聪明，又活泼。他现在到美术学院的夜校去学习绘画。小小的爱米莉在学习方面也有些进步。她跟保姆学讲法国话，还有一位老师教她跳舞。 “到了复活节的时候，乔治就应该受坚信礼了！”看门人的妻子说。乔治已经很大了。 “现在是叫他去学一门手艺的时候了，”爸爸说。“当然要学一个好手艺，这样我们也可以叫他独立生活了。” “可是他晚间得回家睡，”妈妈说；“要找到一个有地方给他住的师傅是不容易的。我们还得做衣服给他穿；他吃的那点儿伙食还不太贵——他有一两个熟马铃薯吃就已经很高兴了；而且他读书也并不花钱。让他自己选择吧；你将来看吧，他会带给我们很大的安慰；那位教授也这样说过。” 受坚信礼穿的新衣已经做好了。那是妈妈亲手为他缝的，不过是由一个做零活的裁缝裁的，而且裁得很好。看门人的妻子说，如果他的境遇好一点，能有一个门面和伙计的话，他也有资格为宫廷里的人做衣服。 受坚信礼的衣服已经准备好了，坚信礼也准备好了。在受坚信礼的那天，乔治从他的教父那里拿到了一个黄铜表。这个教父是一个做麻生意的商人的伙计，在乔治的教父中要算是富有的了。这只表很旧，经受过考验：它走得很快，不过这比走得慢要好得多了。这是一件很贵重的礼品。将军家里送来一本用鞣皮装订的《圣诗集》，是由那个小姑娘赠送的，正如乔治赠送过她图画一样。书的标题页上写着他的名字和她的名字，还写着“祝你万事如意”。这是由将军夫人亲口念出而由别人记下来的。将军仔细看了一次，说：“好极了！” “这样一位高贵的绅士真算是瞧得起我们！”看门人的妻子说。乔治得穿上他受坚信礼的衣服，拿着那本《圣诗集》，亲自到楼上去答谢一番。 将军夫人穿着许多衣服，又害起恶性的头痛病来——当她对于生活感到腻味的时候，就老是患这种病。她对乔治的态度非常和蔼，祝他一切如意，同时也希望自己今后永远也不害头痛病。将军穿着睡衣，戴着一顶有缨子的帽子，穿着一双俄国式的红长统靴。他怀着许多感想和回忆，来回走了三次，然后站着不动，说： “小乔治现在成了一个基督徒！让他也成为一个诚实的、尊敬他长辈的人吧！将来你老了的时候，你可以说这句话是将军教给你的！” 这比他平时所作的演说要长得多！于是他又沉到他的默想中去，现出一副很庄严的样子。不过乔治在这儿听到和看到的一切东西之中，他记得最清楚的是爱米莉小姐。她是多么可爱，多么温柔，多么轻盈，多么娇嫩啊！如果要把她画下来，那么他就应该把她画在肥皂泡上才对。她的衣服，她金色的鬈发，都发出一阵香气，好像她是一棵开着鲜花的玫瑰树一样；而他却曾经把自己的黄油面包分给她吃过！她吃得那么津津有味，每吃一口就对他点点头。她现在是不是还能记得这事呢？是的，当然记得。她还送过他一本美丽的《圣诗集》“作为纪念”呢。因此在新年后新月第一次出现的时候，他就拿着面包和一枚银毫到外边去；他把这书打开，要看看他会翻到哪一首诗。他翻到一首赞美和感恩的诗；于是他又翻开，看小小的爱米莉会得到一首什么诗。他很当心不要翻到悼亡歌那一部分，但是他却翻到关于死和坟墓之间的那几页了。这类事儿当然是不值得相信的！但是他却害怕起来，因为那个柔嫩的小姑娘不久就倒在床上病了，医生的车子每天中午都停在她的门口。 “他们留不住她了！”看门人的妻子说；“我们的上帝知道他应该把什么人收回去！” 然而他们却把她留下来了。乔治画了些图画赠送给她：他画了沙皇的宫殿——莫斯科的古克里姆林宫——一点也不走样：有尖塔，也有圆塔，样子很像绿色和金色的大黄瓜——起码在乔治的画里是如此。小爱米莉非常喜欢它们，因此在一星期以内，乔治又送了几张画给她——它们全是建筑物，因为她可以对建筑物想象许多东西——门里和窗里的东西。 他画了一幢中国式的房于；它有16层楼，每层楼上都有钟乐器。他画了两座希腊的庙宇，有细长的大理石圆柱，周围还有台阶；他画了一个挪威的教堂，你一眼就可以看出来，它完全是木头做的，雕着花，建筑得非常好，每层楼就好像是建筑在摇篮下面的弯杆上一样。但是最美丽的一张画是一个宫殿，它的标题是：“小爱米莉之宫”。她将要住在这样的一座房子里。这完全是乔治的创见；他把一切别的建筑物中最美的东西都移到这座宫殿里来。它像那个挪威的教堂一样，有雕花的大梁；像那个希腊的庙宇一样，有大理石圆柱；每层楼上都有钟乐器，同时在最高一层的顶上有绿色和镀金的圆塔，像沙皇的克里姆林宫。这真是一个孩子的楼阁！每个窗子下面都注明了房间和厅堂的用处：“这是爱米莉睡的地方”，“这是爱米莉跳舞的地方”，“这是爱米莉玩会客游戏的地方”。它看起来很好玩，而大家也就真的来看它了。 “好极了！”将军说。 但是那位年老的伯爵一点也不表示意见。那一位伯爵比将军更有名望，而且还拥有一座宫殿和田庄。他听说它是由一个看门人的小儿子设计和画出来的。不过他现在既然受了坚信礼，就不应该再算是一个小孩子了。老伯爵把这些图画看了一眼，对它们有一套冷静的看法。 有一天，天气非常阴沉、潮湿、可怕。对于小乔治说来，这要算是最明朗和最好的时候了。艺术学院的那位教授把他喊进去。 “请听着，我的朋友，”他说。“我们来谈一下吧！上帝厚待你，使你有些天资。他还对你很好，使你跟许多好人来往。住在街角的那位老伯爵跟我谈到过你；我也看到过你的图画。我们可以在那上面修几笔，因为它们有许多地方需要修正。请你每星期到我的绘图学校来两次；以后你就可以画得好一点。我相信，你可以成为一个好建筑师，而不是一个画家；你还有时间可以考虑这个问题。不过请你今天到住在街角的老伯爵那儿去，同时感谢我们的上帝，你居然碰到了这样一个人！” 街角的那幢房子是很大的；它的窗子上雕着大象和单峰骆驼——全是古代的手工艺。不过老伯爵最喜欢新时代和这个时代所带来的好处，不管这些好处是来自第二层楼、地下室，或者阁楼。 “我相信，”看门人的妻子说，“一个真正伟大的人是不会太骄傲的。那位老伯爵是多么可爱和直爽啊！他讲起话来的态度跟你和我完全一样；将军家里的人做不到这一点！你看，昨天乔治受到伯爵热情的接待，简直是高兴得不知怎样办才好。今天我跟这个伟人谈过话，也有同样的感觉。我们没有让乔治去当学徒，不是一件很好的事吗？他是一个有天资的人。” “但是他需要外来的帮助，”父亲说。 “他现在已经得到帮助了，”妈妈说，“伯爵的话已经讲得很清楚了。” “事情有这样的结果，跟将军家的关系是分不开的！”爸爸说。“我们也应该感谢他们。” “自然喽！”妈妈说，“不过我觉得他们没有什么东西值得我们感谢，我应该感谢我们的上帝；我还有一件事应该感谢他：爱米莉现在懂事了！”爱米莉在进步，乔治也在进步。在这一年中他得到一个小小的银奖章；后来没有多久又得到一个较大的奖章。 “如果我们把他送去学一门手艺倒也好了！”母亲说，同时哭起来；“那样我们倒还可以把他留下来！他跑到罗马去干什么呢？就是他回来了，我永远也不会再看到他的；但是他不会回来的，我可爱的孩子！” “但是这是他的幸运和光荣啊！”爸爸说。 “是的，谢谢你，我的朋友！”妈妈说，“不过你没说出你心里的话！你跟我一样，也是很难过的！” 就想念和别离说来，这是真的。大家都说，这个年轻人真幸运。 乔治告别了，也到将军家里去告别了。不过将军夫人没有出来，因为她又在害她的重头痛病。作为临别赠言，将军把他那个唯一的故事又讲了一遍——他对那位王公所讲的话，和那位王公对他所讲的话：“你是盖世无双的！”于是他就把手伸向乔治——一只松软的手。 爱米莉也把手向乔治伸出来，她的样子几乎有些难过；不过乔治是最难过的。 当一个人在忙的时候，时间就过去了；当一个人在闲着的时候，时间也过去了。时间是同样地长，但不一定是同样有用。就乔治说来，时间很有用，而且除非他在想家的时候以外，也似乎不太长。住在楼上和楼下的人生活得好吗？嗯，信上也谈到过；而信上可写的东西也不少；可以写明朗的太阳光，也可以写阴沉的日子。他们的事情信上都有：爸爸已经死了，只有母亲还活着。爱米莉一直是一个会安慰人的安琪儿。妈妈在信中写道：她常常下楼来看她。信上还说，主人准许她仍旧保留着看门的这个位置。 将军夫人每天写日记。在她的日记里，她参加的每一个宴会，每一个舞会，接见的每一个客人，都记载下来了。日记本里还有些外交官和显贵人士的名片作为插图。她对于她的日记本感到骄傲。日子越长，篇幅就越多：她害过许多次重头痛病，参加过许多次热闹的晚会——这也就是说，参加过宫廷的舞会。 爱米莉第一次去参加宫廷舞会的时候，妈妈是穿着级有黑花边的粉红色衣服。这是西班牙式的装束！女儿穿着白衣服，那么明朗，那么美丽！绿色的缎带在她戴着睡莲花冠的金黄鬈发上飘动着，像灯心草一样。她的眼睛是那么蓝，那么清亮；她的嘴是那么红，那么小；她的样子像一个小人鱼，美丽得超乎想象之外。三个王子跟她跳过舞，这也就是说，第一个跳了，接着第二个就来跳。将军夫人算是一整个星期没有害过头痛病了。 头一次的舞会并不就是最后的一次，不过爱米莉倒是累得吃不消了。幸而夏天到了；它带来休息和新鲜空气。这一家人被请到那位老伯爵的王府里去。 王府里有一个花园，值得一看。它有一部分布置得古色古香，有庄严的绿色篱笆，人们在它们之间走就好像置身于有窥孔的、绿色的屏凤之间一样。黄杨树和水松被剪扎成为星星和金字塔的形状，水从嵌有贝壳的石洞里流出来。周围有许多巨大的石头雕成的人像——你从它们的衣服和面孔就可以认得出来；每一块花畦的形状不是一条鱼，一个盾牌，就是一个拼成字。这是花园富有法国风味的一部分。从这儿你可以走到一个新鲜而开阔的树林里去。树在这儿可以自由地生长，因此它们是又大又好看。草是绿色的，可以在上面散步。它被剪过，压平过，保护得很好。这是这花园富有英国风味的一部分。 “旧的时代和新的时代，”伯爵说，“在这儿和谐地配合在一起！两年以后这房子就会有它一套独特的风格。它将会彻底地改变——变成一种更好、更美的东西。我把它设计给你看，同时还可以把那个建筑师介绍给你们。他今天来这儿吃午饭！” “好极了！”将军说。 “这儿简直像一个天堂！”夫人说。“那儿你还有一个华丽的王府！” “那是我的鸡屋。”伯爵说。“鸽子住在顶上，吐绶鸡住在第一层楼，不过老爱尔茜住在大厅里。她的四周还有客房：孵卵鸡单独住在一起，带着小鸡的母鸡又另外住在一起，鸭子有它们自己到水里去的出口！” “好极了！”将军重复说。 于是他们就一起去看这豪华的布置。 老爱尔茜在大厅的中央，她旁边站着的是建筑师乔治。过了多少年以后，现在他和小爱米莉又在鸡屋里碰头了。 是的，他就站在这儿，他的风度很优雅；面孔是开朗的，有决断的；头发黑得发光；嘴唇上挂着微笑，好像是说：“我耳朵后面坐着一个调皮鬼，他对你的里里外外都知道得清清楚楚。”老爱尔茜为了要对贵客们表示尊敬，特地把她的木鞋脱掉，穿着袜子站着。母鸡咯咯地叫，公鸡喔喔地啼，鸭子一边蹒跚地走，一边嘎嘎地喊。不过那位苍白的、苗条的姑娘站在那儿——她就是他儿时的朋友，将军的女儿——她苍白的脸上发出一阵绯红，眼睛睁得很大，嘴唇虽然没透露出一句话，却表示出无穷尽的意思。如果他们不是一家人，或者从来没有在一起跳过舞，这要算一个年轻人从一个女子那里所能得到的最漂亮的敬礼了。她和这位建筑师却是从来没有在一起跳过舞的。 伯爵和他握手，介绍他说，“我们的年轻朋友乔治先生并不完全是一个生人。” 将军夫人行了礼。她的女儿正要向他伸出手来，忽然又缩回去了。 “我们亲爱的乔治先生！”将军说，“我们是住在一处的老朋友，好极了！” “你简直成了一个意大利人了。”将军夫人说，“我想你的意大利话一定跟意大利人讲得一样好了。” 将军夫人会唱意大利歌，但是不会讲意大利话——将军这样说。 乔治坐在爱米莉的右首。将军陪着她，伯爵陪着将军夫人。 乔治先生讲了一些奇闻轶事，他讲得很好。他是这次宴会中的灵魂和生命，虽然老伯爵也可以充当这个角色。爱米莉坐着一声不响；她的耳朵听着，她的眼睛亮着。 但是她一句话也不说。 后来她和乔治一起在阳台上的花丛中间站着。玫瑰花的篱笆把他们遮住了。乔治又是第一个先讲话。 “我感谢你对我老母亲的厚意！”他说。“我知道，我父亲去世的那天晚上，你特别走下楼来陪着她，一直到他闭上眼睛为止。我感谢你！”他握着爱米莉的手，吻了它——在这种情形下他是可以这样做的。她脸上发出一阵绯红，不过她把他的手又捏了一下，同时用温柔的蓝眼睛盯了他一眼。 “你的母亲是一位慈爱的妈妈！她是多么疼爱你啊！她让我读你写给她的信，我现在可说是很了解你了！我小的时候，你对我是多么和气啊；你送给我许多图画——” “而你却把它们撕成碎片！”乔治说。 “不，我仍然保存着我的那座楼阁——它的图画。” “现在我要把楼阁建筑成为实物了！”乔治说，同时对自己的话感到兴奋起来。 将军和夫人在自己的房间里谈论着这个看门人的儿子，他的行为举止很好，谈吐也能表示出他的学问和聪明。“他可以做一个家庭教师！”将军说。 “简直是天才！”将军夫人说。她不再说别的话了。 在美丽的夏天里，乔治到伯爵王府来的次数更多了。当他不来的时候，大家就想念他。 “上帝赐给你的东西比赐给我们这些可怜的人多得多！”爱米莉对他说。“你体会到这点没有？” 乔治感到很荣幸，这么一个漂亮的年轻女子居然瞧得起他。他也觉得她得天独厚。 将军渐渐深切地感觉到乔治不可能是地下室里长大的孩子。 “不过他的母亲是一个非常诚实的女人，”他说，“这点使我永远记得她。” 夏天过去了，冬天来了。人们更常常谈论起乔治先生来。他在高尚的场合中都受到重视和欢迎。将军在宫廷的舞会中碰见他。现在家中要为小爱米莉开一个舞会了。是不是把乔治先生也请来呢？ “国王可以请的人，将军当然也可以请的！”将军说，同时他挺起腰来，整整高了一寸。 乔治先生得到了邀请，而他也就来了。王子和伯爵们也来了，他们跳起舞来一个比一个好；不过爱米莉只能跳头一次的舞。她在这次舞中扭了脚；不太厉害，但是使她感到很不舒服。因此她得很当心，不能再跳，只能望着别人跳。她坐在那儿望着，那位建筑师站在她身边。 “你真是把整个圣·彼得教堂都给她了！”将军从旁边走过去的时候说。他笑得像一个慈爱的老人。 几天以后，他用同样慈爱的笑来接待乔治先生。这位年轻人是来感谢那次邀请他参加舞会的，他还能有什么别的话呢？是的，这是一件最使人惊奇、最使人害怕的事情！他说了一些疯狂的话。将军简直不能相信自己的耳朵，“荒唐的建议”——一个不可想象的要求：乔治先生要求小爱米莉做他的妻子！ “天啦！”将军说，他的脑袋气得要裂开了。“我一点也不懂得你的意思！你说的什么？你要求什么？先生，我不认识你！朋友！你居然带着这种念头到我家里来！我要不要呆在这儿呢？”于是他就退到卧室里去，把门锁上，让乔治单独站在外面。他站了几分钟，然后就转身走出去。爱米莉站在走廊里。 “父亲答应了吗？——”她问，她的声音有些发抖。 乔治握着她的手。“他避开我了！——机会还有！” 爱米莉的眼睛里充满了眼泪；但是这个年轻人的眼睛里充满了勇气和信心。太阳照在他们两个人身上，为他们祝福。将军坐在自己的房间里，气得不得了。是的，他还在生气，而且用这样的喊声表示出来：“简直是发疯！看门人的发疯！” 不到一点钟，将军夫人就从将军口里听到这件事情。她把爱米莉喊来，单独和她坐在一起。
