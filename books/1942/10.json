I’ve sold every one of them already. I was hoping you’d be bringing me more.”\\n\\n “I’m working on it.”\\n\\n “That would be great.” This was by far the longest and most involved conversation of their three-year working relationship.\\n\\n “You haven’t come into André’s,” Jon said. “I was looking forward to cooking for you.”\\n\\n “I appreciated the invitation, really I did, but I’m worried about giving you the wrong impression. Like I explained, I’m divorced and I’m not going to remarry and this party is just a friends thing…. If you came, that would be fabulous but only because I want you to meet Terri. Oh, did I mention we’re holding it at The Captain’s Galley, in the bar?” She managed to get all that out in a single breath. “Halloween night,” she added.\\n\\n “I’ll get back to you.”\\n\\n Maryellen thought that was fair enough.\\n\\n After two glorious days and nights with her husband, Justine no longer had any doubts about her marriage. She was more in love than she’d dreamed possible.\\n\\n Flying up to Alaska on the spur of the moment like that, without making any arrangements, had been preposterous, and yet she’d found Seth. Justine considered it a sign. Seth was truly meant to be her husband.\\n\\n In a few weeks he’d be home, and they could discuss the future and make the necessary plans for their lives together. There had been so many pressing questions she’d wanted to ask him. But once they were together, none of them had seemed all that important. The only thing that mattered was lying in Seth’s arms, sharing their love.\\n\\n Justine vowed that if Seth asked it of her, she’d live aboard his sailboat for the rest of her life. But she suspected he’d probably want to move in with her. Staying in her apartment was more practical than living at the marina.\\n\\n She’d told him about sleeping on his boat at her most desperate moments, seeking to feel closer to him. From his reaction, she knew he’d been touched by her fears. He’d kissed her again and again as she described her doubts, all the while whispering reassurances and promises. Justine had left Alaska feeling deeply loved.\\n\\n The following Friday night, Justine dropped by her mother’s house on Lighthouse Road\\n\\n . She hadn’t been avoiding Olivia, but she hadn’t sought her out, either.\\n\\n By the time Justine pulled up in front of the large two-story house with the wide wraparound veranda, her mother was at the door, waiting for her.\\n\\n “Hi, Mom.”\\n\\n “Justine! I’m so glad to see you,” Olivia said, hugging her tight. “You haven’t come to the house in ages.”\\n\\n “I’ve been busy—in fact, last weekend I flew up to Alaska to see Seth.”\\n\\n “You were in Alaska? You might’ve let someone know.” The disapproving edge was back, but Justine chose to ignore it.\\n\\n “You’re right, I should have,” she agreed mildly. She wasn’t here to fight with her mother.\\n\\n “Come inside,” Olivia insisted, wrapping her sweater more snugly around her. “It’s cool this evening.”\\n\\n Justine obediently followed her mother into the house. The kitchen was the most comfortable room and it seemed natural to sit there. “Tea?” Olivia asked. It was one of their long-standing rituals.\\n\\n “Please.”\\n\\n Her mother turned away as she put water on to boil. “How is Seth?”\\n\\n “Wonderful. He’ll be home soon. I miss him so much. That’s the reason I flew to Alaska—I just couldn’t stand being so far away from Seth and I had all these air miles from my credit card. I called the airline, got a seat and off I went—without even knowing if I’d find him or not. I was afraid to tell you what I was doing for fear you’d try to change my mind.”\\n\\n “You went through all that to be with your husband?” her mother asked.\\n\\n “Oh, yes. I really am in love with him, Mom.”\\n\\n Justine expected this news to be exactly what her mother wanted to hear. Instead Olivia was frowning.\\n\\n “What?” Justine asked.\\n\\n Olivia pulled out a chair and sat across from her. “Does Seth know you had lunch with Warren?”\\n\\n So that explained it. Her mother knew. For that matter, so did Seth, and while he hadn’t asked her not to see Warren again, she could tell he wasn’t pleased that she’d accepted his invitation to lunch. Justine had been a bit surprised by that, but she wouldn’t do it again.\\n\\n “Warren wants you back, doesn’t he?” her mother said when she didn’t immediately respond.\\n\\n “Did I mention that Maryellen Sherman and I met for lunch earlier this week?” Justine said, pointedly changing the subject. Warren was off-limits as far as she was concerned. “She wanted to congratulate Seth and me.”\\n\\n Her mother set the bowl of tea bags in the center of the table. “So you’d prefer not to discuss Warren.”\\n\\n “That’s right.”\\n\\n Olivia squared her shoulders and nodded firmly. “Then we won’t. Tell me about Seth. When will he be back?”\\n\\n Justine filled in the details. The longer she spoke, the more relaxed her mother became—and Justine understood why. Her mother finally had complete confidence in her love for Seth. Olivia now knew that nothing Warren said or did was going to change the way Justine felt about her husband.\\n\\n “How is Maryellen?” Olivia asked as she poured them each a second cup of tea. “I see Grace every week at our aerobics class, but we seldom have a chance to talk.” She laughed. “Actually we need all our energy just to breathe. Did Maryellen tell you Grace filed for divorce?”\\n\\n Justine nodded. “By the way, what happened with Maryellen’s marriage?” It’d never occurred to her to ask before. Justine had only been fourteen at the time. All she remembered was her mother and Grace, her best friend, talking on the phone a great deal. Maryellen had moved home for a while, and she’d taken back her maiden name as if she’d never been married at all.\\n\\n Her mother stirred a teaspoon of sugar into her tea. “I don’t think anyone really knows, not even Grace. When Maryellen got married, I remember Grace telling me she didn’t feel Clint Jorstad was a good match for her daughter.”\\n\\n “Apparently she was right,” Justine said. Then a frightening thought occurred to her. “What do you feel about Seth and me?” she asked, raising hopeful eyes to her mother, trusting her judgment and wisdom.\\n\\n “Oh, Justine, I think the world of Seth. I couldn’t be more pleased for you both. Seth’s perfect for you.”\\n\\n Justine smiled. “I think so, too, Mom, I really do.” For the first time in a while, she thought about her brother. Seth and Jordan were best friends, and then Jordan had drowned the summer they were all thirteen. Seth was in Alaska with his father and hadn’t learned of the accident until he’d returned home. Justine had been with Jordan that dreadful August day. She’d held his lifeless body until the paramedics arrived. He was her twin, her best friend and her brother. Her entire world had changed that summer. Only a few months afterward, her parents had divorced and within a shockingly short time her father had remarried. Her younger brother, James, seemed oblivious to the uprooting of their security, but Justine had felt it all, lived it all.\\n\\n “What are you thinking?” her mother asked, a slight frown on her face.\\n\\n Justine shook her head. “Nothing important,” she said, which wasn’t true. But she didn’t want to bring up the one memory that would never stop hurting. The one death her mother could never recover from. Drinking the last of her tea, she carried the cup and saucer to the sink and said, “I’d better get home.”\\n\\n “Thank you for coming by.” Olivia touched Justine’s cheek. “I’m thrilled about you and Seth. Honestly.”\\n\\n “I am happy, Mom,” Justine said and impulsively hugged her mother. “Next time I won’t wait so long to visit.”\\n\\n “Good.” Olivia walked her to the porch and waved as Justine drove off.\\n\\n When Justine got back to the apartment complex, she found a note from the manager taped to her door; it said she’d accepted a delivery on Justine’s behalf.\\n\\n After dropping off her mail, she hurried down to the manager’s office and learned that a huge flower arrangement had arrived. The large crystal vase was filled with an array of carnations, pink lilies, irises and a handful of others she couldn’t name, as well as artful sprigs of greenery. It could only be from Seth.\\n\\n Justine could hardly wait to read the card. Seth loved her, missed her, and her sweet, wonderful husband must have realized she’d need an emotional boost to get her through the next few weeks.\\n\\n Justine discovered almost immediately how wrong she was. Only one word was written on the card.\\n\\n Warren.\\n\\n She groaned with disappointment and tossed the small card onto the kitchen counter. She set the vase carelessly on the table, cringing every time she looked at it.\\n\\n An hour later, while she was scrounging around her refrigerator, seeking out something easy and edible for dinner, the doorbell rang.\\n\\n She answered it to find Warren Saget standing there, wearing a flashy thousand-dollar business suit and an even flashier smile. “Hello, Justine.”\\n\\n “Hello, Warren,” she said without enthusiasm.\\n\\n “Did you get my flowers?”\\n\\n She didn’t invite him inside. “I did, but I wish you hadn’t.”\\n\\n “I wanted to thank you for having lunch with me.”\\n\\n She’d guessed as much. “It was very thoughtful.”\\n\\n He met her eyes, then stared at the handle on the door. “Can I come in?”\\n\\n She shook her head. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.” If her mother had heard about their lunch date, Justine wondered how many other people in town already knew. She had no intention of adding to the gossip by having Warren’s visit to her apartment reported next.\\n\\n “All right,” Warren said, looking hurt and a little confused. “I didn’t mean to intrude.”\\n\\n “You didn’t, it’s just that…” She stopped herself from saying more. Warren was far to clever when it came to getting his own way and she wasn’t going to make it any easier.\\n\\n He waited for her to continue and when she didn’t, he asked, “Do you have any plans tonight?”\\n\\n She certainly wasn’t telling him that the most exciting plan she had was a rerun of Nash Bridges. “Why?”\\n\\n “I was hoping you’d have dinner with me. No pressure. It’s just that I figured you might be lonely with Seth gone for so many weeks. I thought you might enjoy a night on the town.”\\n\\n “No thanks, Warren.”\\n\\n He shrugged. “No harm in asking,” he said with a forced smile.\\n\\n “Actually I think there might be.”\\n\\n He arched his eyebrows as if she’d surprised him.\\n\\n “The two of us shouldn’t be seeing each other. It’s…inappropriate. In fact, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t visit me again—either at work or at my apartment.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/204-rosewood-lane-cedar-cove-2/page-10.html","bookId":1942,"book":{"id":1942,"title":"204 Rosewood Lane (Cedar Cove #2)","description":"Storyline: 204 Rosewood Lane (Cedar Cove #2) \\n Grace Sherman \\n 204 Rosewood Lane \\n Cedar Cove, Washington \\n Dear Listener, \\n If you\u0027ve been to Cedar Cove before we\u0027ve probably met.
