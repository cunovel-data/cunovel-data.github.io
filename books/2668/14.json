{"id":65788,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Gavin slugged back a gulp of foamy ale. It burned the back of his throat, warming its way down to his belly, and settled there, heightening the faint haze that softened his mind. Someone guffawed in his ear-\u0027twas Thomas, laughing at his own jest-whilst another companion snorted with mirth, spewing ale from his mouth and spraying Gavin\u0027s cheek.\\n\\n With a swipe over his face, Gavin laughed too, automatically, then took another drink. He leaned an elbow on the split log table that was sticky from spilled ale and reminded himself again not to look in the direction of the high table. If he did, it would seem as though he were looking at Judith and Lady Madelyne.\\n\\n Aye, if he turned that way, it might appear that he was interested in what the ladies were doing, or as though he cared whether they had been joined by any of the noblemen who visited the king\u0027s court.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t interested and he didn\u0027t care.\\n\\n On the morrow, he would make certain that Lady Madelyne had her audience with King Henry, and he and the sovereign would determine the best way to notify de Belgrume that his daughter was in their custody. Then, he, Gavin, need have naught further to do with her, and he could return to Mal Verne, knowing that de Belgrume was under the king\u0027s control at last.\\n\\n He tightened his fingers around the wooden ale cup. Allowing de Belgrume to live was not his preference...but in this, he must obey his king until Fantin misstepped again. Then, Gavin vowed, he would be waiting for the opportunity to finish what had been started seven years earlier.\\n\\n The sweet sound of a lute caught his ears, wafting over the dull roar of the diners. Forgetting that he didn\u0027t want to look that way, Gavin turned toward the high table where Henry and his queen, Eleanor, supped. Instead of seeking the musician, his gaze found and settled on the willowy figure of Lady Madelyne only three tables away. She\u0027d been seated facing him, but now had half-turned toward the lute player, giving Gavin a covert view of her profile.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t pull his attention away. She looked so calm and serene, beautiful in her composure in the midst of the energetic, rowdy crowd. He saw the slim, white column of her neck-bared now that the thick masses of braids had been gathered above her ears-and watched the curve of it shift innocently as she strained to look between the crowd to see the musician. The bareness of her neck seemed almost obscene to Gavin, for she still had the aura of an innocent, virginal nun, and the baring of such skin was too intimate for a protected woman.\\n\\n He frowned, tasting his ale again, but still unwilling to look away. He could still taste the sweetness of her full mouth beneath his, and had no delay in summoning to memory the feel of her soft curves molding beneath his hands. Desire that he had suppressed sprang to life, sending waves of heat pulsing through the core of his abdomen, and lower.\\n\\n He swore silently, then buried his face in the ale cup again ...but his gaze remained fixed on Madelyne.\\n\\n Judith chose that moment to glance in his direction, and Gavin looked away too late. He felt his neck warm as he jerked his eyes away, pretending to look at the lute-player. His time would be better spent looking for a willing maidservant in the stead of gaping at a holy woman.\\n\\n With renewed firmness, he turned away, his gaze scanning the rearmost tables for the comely maidservant he especially sought when at court.\\n\\n \"Who is the woman there?\" asked Lord Ferrell, one of the men with whom he was seated.\\n\\n Gavin swung to look at him and caught the eye of Thomas, who had a brow raised in question. Gavin gave a sharp nod, and his friend replied, \"\u0027Tis Lady Madelyne de Belgrume, Ferrell, lately arrived at court.\"\\n\\n \"De Belgrume?\" Ferrell\u0027s bushy eyebrows twitched in confusion. \"The get of Fantin de Belgrume? I did not believe he had an heir.\" He turned to look toward Madelyne again, and Gavin could easily discern the thoughts that bumbled through the man\u0027s head. \"Did he not have a daughter who perished some years ago? And a wife too? Do you not tell me....\" his voice trailed off and he stared at the woman, his eyes slitting as his brows twitched. \"\u0027Tis not the selfsame woman, is it, Thomas? Where has he hidden such a beauty all these years?\" He made to stand, brushing crumbs from his tunic and swiping a hand over his wiry gray hair.\\n\\n \"Sit down, Ferrell, and stick your pecker back in your breeches,\" Gavin drawled, shifting his shoulders to alleviate the tension that was gathering there. \"The wench came from an abbey--she is promised to be a nun.\"\\n\\n Ferrell looked at him blankly, then returned his gaze to Madelyne. \"\u0027Tis a good jest, Mal Verne, but I vow, I\u0027ve never seen a woman who looks less like a holy woman than that wench.\"\\n\\n \"I brought her from the abbey myself,\" Gavin told him, a bit of steel creeping into his voice. \"She\u0027s under the protection of the king.\"\\n\\n Ferrell frowned again, then sank back onto the bench where he\u0027d been seated. \"Bloody shame,\" he said sadly, bringing his cup to his mouth and slurping. \"Bloody damned shame.\"\\n\\n Gavin\u0027s mind echoed those thoughts, and he swiveled to cast a last glance at Madelyne\u0027s table. His momentary relief vanished when he saw Lord Reginald D\u0027Orrais laughing as he took a seat next to her.\\n\\n \u0027Twas heaven...pure heaven.\\n\\n Madelyne sighed, pushing away the knowledge that, strictly speaking, it was a blasphemous thought, and closed her eyes. Strong fingers kneaded her skull, threading through her hair and loosening the ten braids that had pulled her scalp taut for hours. The dull ache gave way to relief and she sighed again, resting her head in the palms of her maid\u0027s hands.\\n\\n Tricky\u0027s chatter flowed in and out of Madelyne\u0027s consciousness just as her nimble fingers brushed through Maddie\u0027s long hair. \"...Never seen such food! I could barely choose betwixt the rabbit, the capon, and the roast goose...an\u0027 when they brought forth the stuffed pigeons, I thought I\u0027d eat to bursting!\" She reached in front of Madelyne for a comb carved of wormwood with bits of mother of pearl inlaid amongst the etchings on its side.\\n\\n \"How did you come by such a pretty comb?\" asked Madelyne curiously. It slid smoothly through her hair, running over her shoulder and along the length of her back, past the edge of the stool on which she sat.\\n\\n \"\u0027Twas a gift,\" Tricky replied smugly, maintaining her rhythm of long, sure strokes. \"Whilst Clem and I were gone to seek aught for you to break your fast, we chanced upon a merchant showing his wares. I made such a moon-face of myself that he had no choice but to buy it for me.\" She giggled girlishly, jerking Madelyne\u0027s hair in her distraction. She froze, smoothing her fingers solicitiously over the tender spot. \"Ah, my lady, forgive me. I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you.\"\\n\\n Madelyne laughed softly at her friend\u0027s enthusiasm. Since leaving Lock Rose Abbey, it had become clear to her that Patricka was in no manner suited for the life of a nun...nor was Madelyne any more certain that she was cut of a maid\u0027s cloth. \"You didn\u0027t hurt me, Tricky, \u0027though such inattention could do so in the future. Nevertheless, you have worked such magic on my aching head that I would forgive you in a trice even if you had pulled my hair.\" She sighed, smiling, suddenly in a delightful mood. \"I shall remember not to ask you of your paramours whilst you have a brush in my hair anon.\"\\n\\n \"Paramours! Hah!\" Tricky nearly caught the comb in a tangle again, but caught herself in time. \"Mayhaps one could name Jube such, but I do not care for that malcontent Clem at all. I wish only to torture the man, for he does naught but stand about and glower at me. I do believe he could be taking instruction from Lord Mal Verne.\"\\n\\n Madelyne felt her eyebrows rise at such a blatant criticism, but she could not fault Tricky for accuracy in her observations. Indeed, she had felt the weight of Gavin\u0027s surly stare that evening. Firming her lips, she reminded herself that \u0027twas she who had cause to be furious with him, rather than the other way around. Despite the fact that her heart had jumped into her throat when she\u0027d turned to see him, and regardless of the acuteness of the memory of his lips tasting hers, Madelyne knew she couldn\u0027t trust those flighty emotions. She could not trust him.\\n\\n For some reason, that realization pained her more than leaving the abbey. Emptiness and unease settled around her, and the back of her throat hurt when she swallowed. Before the surprise tears could materialize, she stood and Tricky let the comb slip from her hair. Fighting sadness, Maddie walked toward the tiny fireplace, her eyes fixed on the orange flames. Peg had set the fire and it burned calmly in its little enclosure, whilst Peg herself snored on a pallet in the corner.\\n\\n \"Methinks my lady has attracted her own paramour,\" Tricky said slyly, shoving her comb into a small linen pouch. She pulled on the strings to tighten the opening of the bag and glanced at Madelyne.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Maddie asked, startled. A warmth that had naught to do with the fire suffused her face. She folded her hands in front of her and sat on the stool near the fireplace, looking over at her maid.\\n\\n \"Lady Judith had the right of it when she said you would attract attention,\" Tricky responded, busying herself by folding one of the tunics Judith had loaned Madelyne. \"I saw many people staring at you, my lady-\"\\n\\n Madelyne relaxed. \"\u0027Twas no more than curiosity, Tricky.\"\\n\\n \"Mayhaps from some, aye. But the tall man who sat next to you had more than curiosity in his face.\" She spoke matter-of-factly, turning to open a trunk where the other tunics were stored.\\n\\n Tricky could have no idea that her casual words sent Madelyne\u0027s heart sliding into a heavy ball in her stomach. \"Lord Reginald? Why, he....\" She allowed her voice to trail off. He had been very attentive once Lady Judith had consented him to sup with them, his soft lips pressing lightly to the back of her hand upon introduction. His blue eyes glowed with warmth and humor, and his mouth quirked in a ready smile above the deeply cleft, square chin. \"He merely wished to find a seat near an acquaintance of his,\" she continued firmly, recounting the excuse he\u0027d given them upon approach.\\n\\n \"Mmm.\" Tricky continued her business of arranging the bolts of cloth and other materials left by the seamstress. \"From the back of the hall, where Peg and I sat, he appeared to spend more of his time conversing with you, my lady, than any other in the vicinity.\"\\n\\n Madelyne took a deep breath to calm the churning in her stomach. \"I did nothing to encourage Lord Reginald,\" she said, defending herself without wondering why she should do so-most especially why she should do so to her own maid. But Tricky had been her friend before taking on the subservient role, and, in truth, aside from Judith, Madelyne had no one else to confide in.\\n\\n Then, with a sinking heart, she recalled her forward actions of resting her fingers lightly on the edge of his sleeve as she leaned toward him to comment on a nearby juggler, and the overbright smile she rewarded him with upon his own jests. And, she remembered the sharpening of her breath when Lord Reginald touched her hand, or offered her a tasty bite of venison...and the increase in her pulse when he smiled at her so.\\n\\n Mayhaps Tricky had the right of it. Madelyne bit her lower lip and reached for the rose-bead string of prayer beads that hung from her girdle. She would pray on her knees this eve in penance for her coy actions, and she would beg The Lord and The Mother that they would give her strength to keep from straying from her path. \"Lead me not into temptation,\" Madelyne murmured, fingering the beads.\\n\\n \"Pardon, my lady?\" Tricky\u0027s head popped up from where she had been stuffing clothing into another trunk.\\n\\n \"Nay, \u0027twas naught,\" Madelyne replied, looking down at her beads. This was the first time she\u0027d meant to use them since leaving the abbey, though they had always hung at her side. She had prayed oft to The Father and the saints, and she attended Mass once a day or more...but she had avoided using her beads since Lord Gavin had taken her from Lock Rose Abbey.\\n\\n She wondered suddenly whether he still had those beads she had given him on his first visit to the abbey...or whether they had been destroyed or lost. It had surprised and moved her that he still carried them when he came back to the abbey.\\n\\n Her fingers worried the strand of scented beads, feeling the roundness of them and the tiny scores made by the little paddle she\u0027d used to form them. Gavin\u0027s serious face loomed in her memory-the harshness and unyielding planes of his countenance melding into the intense, blazing expression that had been there in the glen, when he\u0027d kissed her. His mouth had been so persuasive, so demanding...her body turned to liquid again, now, at the mere thought of it. She still remembered the thickness of his damp hair, smooth and heavy under her fingers, and how tall and hard he\u0027d been...how safe she\u0027d felt.\\n\\n Madelyne shook her head violently as if to chase the remembrance away. How could she be thinking of such a thing? She was meant to be a nun-she had vowed her life to God-and she should be on her knees begging forgiveness for her transgressions of this evening, not mooning over the memory of another sin.\\n\\n Sin.\\n\\n Dear God, it did not feel like a sin. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sanctuary-of-roses-medieval-herb-garden-2/page-14.html","bookId":2668,"book":{"id":2668,"title":"Sanctuary of Roses (Medieval Herb Garden #2)","description":"Storyline: Sanctuary of Roses (Medieval Herb Garden #2) \\n Passionate romance and court intrigue, lords and ladies, knights and castles... \\n Madelyne de Belgrume has lived in secrecy in a hidden abbey for years.
