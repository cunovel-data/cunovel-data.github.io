{"id":22368,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 41","content":"CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE \n Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver\u0027s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie\u0027s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope. \n They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion? \n Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\u0027s impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver\u0027s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl\u0027s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away. \n Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry. \n \u0027If it be painful to him,\u0027 she thought, \u0027to come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me--he did when he went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.\u0027 And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep. \n She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm. \n \u0027What makes you look so flurried?\u0027 asked Rose, advancing to meet him. \n \u0027I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\u0027 replied the boy. \u0027Oh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!\u0027 \n \u0027I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\u0027 said Rose, soothing him. \u0027But what is this?--of whom do you speak?\u0027 \n \u0027I have seen the gentleman,\u0027 replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, \u0027the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.\u0027 \n \u0027Where?\u0027 asked Rose. \n \u0027Getting out of a coach,\u0027 replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, \u0027and going into a house. I didn\u0027t speak to him--I couldn\u0027t speak to him, for he didn\u0027t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did. Look here,\u0027 said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \u0027here it is; here\u0027s where he lives--I\u0027m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!\u0027 \n With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account. \n \u0027Quick!\u0027 she said. \u0027Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute\u0027s loss of time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.\u0027 \n Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon. \n \u0027Dear me,\u0027 said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, \u0027I beg your pardon, young lady--I imagined it was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse me. Be seated, pray.\u0027 \n \u0027Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?\u0027 said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken. \n \u0027That is my name,\u0027 said the old gentleman. \u0027This is my friend, Mr. Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\u0027 \n \u0027I believe,\u0027 interposed Miss Maylie, \u0027that at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.\u0027 \n Mr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again. \n \u0027I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\u0027 said Rose, naturally embarrassed; \u0027but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.\u0027 \n \u0027Indeed!\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow. \n \u0027Oliver Twist you knew him as,\u0027 replied Rose. \n The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach. \n Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie\u0027s, and said, \n \u0027Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\u0027s name put me in possession of it.\u0027 \n \u0027A bad one! I\u0027ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\u0027 growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face. \n \u0027He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\u0027 said Rose, colouring; \u0027and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027m only sixty-one,\u0027 said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. \u0027And, as the devil\u0027s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don\u0027t see the application of that remark.\u0027 \n \u0027Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow; \u0027he does not mean what he says.\u0027 \n \u0027Yes, he does,\u0027 growled Mr. Grimwig. \n \u0027No, he does not,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke. \n \u0027He\u0027ll eat his head, if he doesn\u0027t,\u0027 growled Mr. Grimwig. \n \u0027He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow. \n \u0027And he\u0027d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\u0027 responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor. \n Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom. \n \u0027Now, Miss Maylie,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow, \u0027to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.\u0027 \n Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow\u0027s house; reserving Nancy\u0027s information for that gentleman\u0027s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend. \n \u0027Thank God!\u0027 said the old gentleman. \u0027This is great happiness to me, great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie. You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have brought him?\u0027 \n \u0027He is waiting in a coach at the door,\u0027 replied Rose. \n \u0027At this door!\u0027 cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word. \n When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface. \n \u0027Hush!\u0027 he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid. I\u0027m old enough to be your grandfather. You\u0027re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!\u0027 \n In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\u0027s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid. \n \u0027There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. \u0027Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.\u0027 \n The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders. \n \u0027Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily. \n \u0027Well, that I do, sir,\u0027 replied the old lady. \u0027People\u0027s eyes, at my time of life, don\u0027t improve with age, sir.\u0027 \n \u0027I could have told you that,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u0027but put on your glasses, and see if you can\u0027t find out what you were wanted for, will you?\u0027 \n The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But Oliver\u0027s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms. \n \u0027God be good to me!\u0027 cried the old lady, embracing him; \u0027it is my innocent boy!\u0027 \n \u0027My dear old nurse!\u0027 cried Oliver. \n \u0027He would come back--I knew he would,\u0027 said the old lady, holding him in her arms. \u0027How well he looks, and how like a gentleman\u0027s son he is dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.\u0027 Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns. \n Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o\u0027clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home. \n Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\u0027s wrath. Nancy\u0027s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\u0027s consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose. \n \u0027Then what the devil is to be done?\u0027 said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies. \u0027Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\u0027 \n \u0027Not exactly that,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; \u0027but we must proceed gently and with great care.\u0027 \n \u0027Gentleness and care,\u0027 exclaimed the doctor. \u0027I\u0027d send them one and all to--\u0027 \n \u0027Never mind where,\u0027 interposed Mr. Brownlow. \u0027But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\u0027 \n \u0027What object?\u0027 asked the doctor. \n \u0027Simply, the discovery of Oliver\u0027s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.\u0027 \n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief; \u0027I almost forgot that.\u0027 \n \u0027You see,\u0027 pursued Mr. Brownlow; \u0027placing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?\u0027 \n \u0027Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\u0027 suggested the doctor, \u0027and transporting the rest.\u0027 \n \u0027Very good,\u0027 replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; \u0027but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to Oliver\u0027s, which is the same thing.\u0027 \n \u0027How?\u0027 inquired the doctor. \n \u0027Thus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\u0027 \n \u0027Then,\u0027 said the doctor impetuously, \u0027I put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really--\u0027 \n \u0027Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\u0027 said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. \u0027The promise shall be kept. I don\u0027t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\u0027 \n Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman\u0027s proposition was carried unanimously. \n \u0027I should like,\u0027 he said, \u0027to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.\u0027 \n \u0027I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,\u0027 said the doctor. \n \u0027We must put it to the vote,\u0027 replied Mr. Brownlow, \u0027who may he be?\u0027 \n \u0027That lady\u0027s son, and this young lady\u0027s--very old friend,\u0027 said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece. \n Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee. \n \u0027We stay in town, of course,\u0027 said Mrs. Maylie, \u0027while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.\u0027 \n \u0027Good!\u0027 rejoined Mr. Brownlow. \u0027And as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver\u0027s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.\u0027 \n With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up. \n 她们打算在伦敦只逗留三天，然后再到遥远的海滨去住几个星期。眼下已经是第一天的午夜。在接下来的四十八小时里，她该走下什么样的行动方针，又如何行动呢？或者说，她怎样才能推迟这趟旅行作和战略战术等原则，战争中的主动性、灵活性、计划性、防，又不至于令人油然生疑？\n 罗斯伯力先生跟她们一块儿来到伦敦，还要在这儿住两天。但露丝深知这位杰出的绅士性情急躁，她清楚地预见到，他一听就会勃然大怒，对再次拐走奥立弗的傀儡恨得七窍生烟，所以露丝不敢将秘密向他和盘托出，除非她替那个姑娘进行的辩解能够得到有经验的人支持。这些也是在把这件事告诉梅莱夫人的时候必须极其谨慎，举止分毫不乱的理由，老太太的头一阵冲动准是去找那位可敬的大夫商量。至于请教哪一位法律顾问，即使她知道该怎么请教，由于相同的理由，恐怕也很难加以考虑。她一度考虑争取得到哈利的帮助，可这个念头却唤起了对最后一次分别的记忆，她似乎不配叫他回来――泪水随着这一连串的回忆涌上了双眼――此时他或许已经学会如何将她淡忘，懂得排遣惆怅了。\n 露丝度过了一个顾虑重重的不眠之夜，她思绪万千，各种各样的考虑依次出现在她的脑海里，她忽而倾向于这一种方法，忽而倾向于那一种办法，忽而又全部推翻。第二天，她考虑再三，终于顾不了那么多，决定请哈利来商量。\n “如果他回到这个地方感到痛苦的话，”她想道，“我该会多么痛苦啊！不过，他也许不来，他可以写信相对性和近似性。断言认识论是建立在反映万物最一般规律，或者他人倒是来了，却故意避开我――他走的时候就是这样。我简直没有想到他会这样，可这对我们俩反而更好。”想到这里，露丝放下了笔，转过脸去，仿佛不愿意让即将替自己担任使者的信笺看见她在哭泣似的。\n 她已经第五十次将同一支笔拿起来，又放下，反复考虑这封信的头一行该怎么写，但又一个字也写不出来，就在这时，在凯尔司先生护卫下上街散步的奥立弗上气不接下气地走进了房间，从他按捺不住的激动来看，似乎又有什么令人不安的事情发生。\n “怎么了你，这么慌里慌张的？”露丝迎上前去，问道。\n “我简直不知道是怎么的，我好像快喘不过气了，”孩子回答，“哦，天啦学开始其学术生涯。1933年去瑞士。1938年移居美国。1948，你想啊，我终于又要看到他了，你也能明白我对你讲的全是真话。”\n “我从来没有认为你对我们说的不是真话，”露丝安慰他说，“究竟是怎么回事？――你说的是谁呀？”\n “我看见那位先生了，”奥立弗兴奋得几乎连话也说不清了，“就是对我非常好的那位先生――布朗罗先生，我们经常谈到的。”\n “在什么地方？”露丝问。\n “从马车上下来，”奥立弗掉下了喜悦的泪水，回答说，“走进一所房子里去了。我没跟他搭话――我没法跟他说话，他没有看见我呢，我一个劲地发抖，连朝他走过去都做不到。可凯尔司替我问了，他是不是住在那儿，他们说是的。你瞧，”奥立弗说着，展开一张纸片，“就在这上边，他就住在这个地方――我马上就到那儿去。当我又见到他，又听到他说话的功夫，真不知该怎么办。”\n 这些话，连同其他许多七长八短的欢呼，大大转移了露丝的注意力，她看了看地址，河滨大道格雷文街，当即决定抓住这个意外的机会。\n “快！”她说道，“吩咐他们雇一辆马车，准备好跟我一块儿去。我这就带你到那儿去，一分钟也别耽搁。我只告诉姑妈我们出去个把小时，你收拾好了就走。”\n 奥立弗根本用不着催促，不出五分钟，他们已经坐上马车直奔格雷文街。到了那个地方，露丝将奥立弗留在马车里，借口老绅士接见他也需要准备准备，她让仆人送上自己的名片，说有非常要紧的事求见布朗罗先生。仆人不多一会就回来了，请她立即上楼。露丝小姐跟着仆人走进楼上的一个房间，见到一位慈眉善目，身穿墨绿色外套的老先生。在离他不远的地方坐着另一位穿淡黄马裤、裹着皮绑腿的老绅士，看上去就不太和气，双手交叉，按在一根粗大的手杖上，托住自己的下巴。\n “哎呀呀，”穿墨绿色外套的绅士礼貌周全，连忙站起来，说道，“小姐，请您原谅――我还以为是某个讨厌的家伙在――您多担待。请坐。”\n “您是布朗罗先生吧，请问？”露丝说着，看了一眼另一位绅士，又把目光移向说话的那一位。\n “正是在下，”老先生说道，“这是我的朋友格林维格先生。格林维格，你让我们谈几分钟好不好？”\n “我想，”梅莱小姐插了一句，“在我们谈话的这段时间里，不必麻烦这位先生回避。如果我所闻属实的话，他知道我想和您商量的事。”\n 布朗罗先生低下头。已经从椅子上站起身来，硬邦邦鞠了一躬的格林维格先生，又硬邦邦地鞠了一躬，腾地坐了下来。\n “我肯定会让您大吃一惊，”露丝不免觉得有些难以启齿，“您毕竟曾经对我的一个非常可爱的小朋友表示出博大的仁慈与善意，我相信您有兴趣再一次听到他的事。”\n “不错。”布朗罗先生说。\n “您知道他名字叫奥立弗退斯特。”露丝答道。\n 这句话刚从她口中说出来，装出正在测览桌上放着的一本大书的格林维格先生就把书给翻了个身，发出哗啦一声巨响，他身子一仰靠在椅背上，脸上所有的表情都不见了，只剩下百分之百的惊异，瞪大眼睛，视而不见地愣了半天，接着，他好像对自己的心情居然这样暴露无余感到有些难为情，他身子猛然一扭，又恢复了刚才的姿势，两眼直视前方，接着发出一声悠长而又深沉的口哨，这一声口哨最后好像不是飘散在空中，而是渐渐消失在他胃部那些深不可测的坑洼里。\n 布朗罗先生同样觉得诧异，只不过没有用这种古怪的态度表现出来。他把椅子往梅莱小姐身边挪了挪，说道：\n “答应我，亲爱的小姐，再也不要提到你说的善意、仁慈什么的，反正旁人也不知道。如果你拿得出任何证据，能够改变我一度对那个苦孩子得出的不良印象，看在上帝的分上，让我也看看这些证据。”\n “一个坏东西。如果他不是个坏东西的话，我就把我的脑袋吃下去。”格林维格先生忿忿不平地说，他说话用的是腹语术，脸上的肌肉纹丝不动。\n “那个孩子天性高尚，又有一副热心肠，”露丝红着脸说，“神有意要让他受到的磨难超过他的年龄，在他心中种下了爱心与感情，即使是许许多多年龄长他六倍的人也应该感到骄傲。”\n “我才六十一岁，”格林维格先生僵硬的面孔依旧纹丝不动，“偏偏那个奥立弗少说也有十二岁了，就跟有魔鬼在搀和一样，我不明白这话是什么意思。”\n “梅莱小姐，别跟我这位朋友计较，”布朗罗先生说，“他这个人有口无心。”\n “不对，是有口有心。”格林维格先生大叫起来。\n “不，是有口无心。”布朗罗先生说着站了起来，他的火气显然上来了。\n “如果是有口无心的话，他会把他的脑袋吃下去。”格林维格先生还在大喊大叫。\n “真要是这样，他理应把脑袋敲下来才对。”布朗罗先生说。\n “可他偏偏想看一看谁敢这么做。”格林维格先生一边应对，一边用手杖敲打着地板。\n 事情就是如此，两位老先生几次动了火气，随后又遵循他们向来的惯例握手言和。\n “好了，梅莱小姐，”布朗罗先生说道，“回到你的一腔美意如此关切的题目上来吧，你能不能告诉我，你得到了这个苦孩子的什么消息？请允许我说两句，为了把他找回来，我想尽了一切办法，开始我认为他在骗我，而他先前那班同伙又缠上了他，想从我这儿捞点什么，我的这种想法自从我出国以来已经大大动摇了。”\n 露丝已经抽空把思绪整理了一番，她直截了当，几句话便将奥立弗离开布朗罗先生的住宅之后发生的事情讲了一遍，只保留了南希报告的消息，准备私下告诉这位先生。她最后保证说，那孩子过去几个月里唯一感到遗憾的就是不能与从前的恩人和朋友相见。\n “谢天谢地。”老绅士说道，“这对我真是莫大的幸福，莫大的幸福。可您还没有告诉我，梅莱小姐，眼下他在什么地方。您一定得原谅我对您求全责备――可为什么不带他一起来呢？”\n “他正在大门外边一辆马车里等着呢。”露丝回答。\n “在这个大门外边！”老绅士大叫一声，匆匆离开房间，走下楼，跳上马车踏板二话没说便冲进了车厢。\n 房门在格林维格先生的身后关上了，他抬起头、用椅子的一条后腿作为圆心，借助他的手杖和桌子，在原地转了整整三圈，在此期间他一直没有离开过椅子。这一转体动作表演完毕，他站起来，一瘸一拐地在房间里走了至少十二个来回，走得再快不过了。接着，他在露丝面前摹地停住脚步，免去一切开场白，吻了吻她。\n 姑娘叫这种不正规的行动吓了一跳，不由得站了起来。“嘘！”他说道，“别怕。依我的年纪足够做你的爷爷了。你是个可爱的姑娘。我喜欢你。他们来啦。”\n 果不其然，他刚一个箭步窜回先前的座位，布朗罗先生便带着奥立弗回来了，格林维格先生非常谦和地向他表示欢迎，即便此时此刻的喜悦就是对露丝梅莱为奥立弗担忧、惦念得到的唯一报偿，她也心满意足了。\n “慢着慢着，还有一个不应该忘掉的人，”布朗罗先生一边说，一边摇铃，“请把贝德温太太叫到这儿来。”\n 老管家风风火火地应召而来。她在门口行了个礼，等候着吩咐。\n “哦，贝德温，你的眼神真是一天不如一天了？”布朗罗先生有些气恼，问道。\n “是啊，先生，那可不，”老太太回答，“人的眼神，到我这个岁数，是不会越来越好的，先生。”\n “这话我早跟你说过，”布朗罗先生回道，“你倒是戴上眼镜，看你能不能自己弄明白为什么叫你来，好吗？”\n 老太太开始在衣袋里找眼镜，但奥立弗的耐心已经再也经受不住这一新的考验，他刚一冲动起来便屈服了，纵身扑进老太太怀里。\n “我的老天爷！”老太太一把抱住他，惊呼着，“这不是我那个受冤枉的孩子吗？”\n “我亲爱的老阿妈！”奥立弗哭喊道。\n “他会回来的――我知道他会回来，”老太太将他搂在怀里，说。“瞧他气色多好，又打扮得像个好人家的子弟啦。这么长日子，你都到哪儿去了？啊！脸蛋还是那样俊，只是没那么苍白了。眼睛也还是那样温顺，但不那么忧郁了。这些我都没忘，还有他温和的微笑，天天都拿来和我自己的几个宝贝孩子比来比去，我还是个快快活活的年轻女子的时候，我那些孩子就死了。”好心的老太太就这么絮絮叨叨地说着，忽而让奥立弗退后一步，看看他长高了多少，忽而又把他拉到身边，溺爱地抚摸他的头发，搂住他的脖子一会儿笑，一会儿哭。\n 布朗罗先生丢下她和奥立弗去畅叙阔别之情，领着露丝走进另一个房间。在那里，他听露丝讲了她与南希见面的全部经过，不禁感到大为震惊和惶惑。露丝还解释了没有立刻向她家的朋友罗斯伯力先生露出一点口风的原因，老先生认为她做得相当谨慎，并且欣然答应亲自与那位可敬的大夫进行一次严肃的会谈。为了让他早一些实施这一计划，随即商定当天晚上八点钟由他到旅馆作一次拜访，与此同时，发生的所有事情都应该谨慎小心地通知梅莱夫人。这些预备措施安排停当，露丝与奥立弗便回去了。\n 对那位好心的大夫发起火来会达到什么程度，露丝绝非估计过高。南希的来历刚一向他摊开，警告与诅咒就像瓢泼大雨一样从他口中倾泻而出，他扬言要请布拉瑟斯先生和达福先生共同出谋划策，将南希头一个捉拿归案，他当场戴上帽子，准备立刻出发以得到那两位名探的帮助。毫无疑问，在一时性起之下，他会将这种意图付诸实施，丝毫也不考虑后果，幸好他受到了阻止，这一方面是由于布朗罗先生以不相上下的激烈态度加以阻拦，他也有一副火暴脾气，另一方面则是大家提出了种种论证和主张，用这些理由来打消他轻举妄动的念头似乎再合适不过了。\n “那到底怎么办呢？”他们与两位女士重新聚到一起，心急莽撞的大夫说道，“我们要不要通过一项议案，向所有那些男男女女的流氓致谢，恳请他们每人笑纳一百镑左右的酬金，聊表我们的敬意，并且因为他们厚待奥立弗，我们要表示一点感激之情？”\n “不完全如此，”布朗罗先生笑着回答，“但我们必须谨慎行事，步步留心。”\n “谨慎行事，步步留心！”大夫嚷了起来，“我要把他们一个个全都送到――”\n “送到哪儿都可以，”布朗罗先生打断了他的话，“不过，得考虑一下，是不是把他们送到什么地方，就能达到我们预期的目的？”\n “什么目的？”大夫问道。\n “很简单，查清奥立弗的身世，替他把应得的遗产夺回来，假如这个故事并非虚构，那么他的这笔遗产已经被人用欺诈手段剥夺了。”\n “啊！”罗斯伯力先生一边说，一边用小手帕擦着汗水，“我差一点把这茬给忘了。”\n “你想一想，”布朗罗先生追问道，“姑且不谈这苦命的姑娘，假定有可能将这帮恶棍绳之以法，又不危及她的安全，这对我们有什么好处呢？”\n “大概，至少得绞死其中的几个，”大夫提议，“其余的流放。”\n “好极了，”布朗罗先生微微一笑，说，“他们迟早会落得咎由自取的下场，可就算我们搀和进去，抢在他们前边，在我看来，我们将会干出十足堂吉河德式的行为，和我们自身的利益――或者最低限度是和奥立弗的利益背道而驰，二者其实是同一码事。”\n “怎么呢？”大夫问。\n “的确如此。很清楚，要探明这个秘密，我们将会遇到异乎寻常的困难，除非能够让孟可司这个人就范。这只能智取，要趁他不在那些人中间的时候逮住他。其理由是，假定他已经在押，我们也拿不出指控他的证据。他甚至于（就我们所知，或者就我们掌握的事实而言）没有参与这伙歹徒的任何一次抢劫。即使他没有获得释放，最多也就是作为流氓、无赖给关进监狱，不会受到进一步的惩罚，以后我们休想从他回中掏出一句话，他会变得又聋，又哑，又瞎，整个一个白痴。”\n “那，”大夫性急地说，“我再问你一句，你难道认为，信守我们向那个姑娘作出的承诺是合乎理智的，我们本着最美好最善良的意愿作出了这一保证，可实际上――”\n “请不要对这一点多加争论，我亲爱的小姐，”露丝正打算开口，布朗罗先生拦住了她。“承诺是必须遵守的。我并不认为这会给我们的行动造成丝毫妨碍。不过，在决定任何一种明确的行动方针之前，我们有必要见见那姑娘，向她讲明，是由我们，而不是由法律去对付这个孟可司，她是否愿意指认一下他，换句话说，如果她不愿意，或者无能为力的话，就请她讲讲他常去什么地方，长的什么样子，以便能把他给认出来。星期天晚上之前是见不着她了，今天才星期二。我建议，大家在此期间要绝对保持冷静，这些事情就是对奥立弗本人也要保密。”\n 罗斯伯力先生不断扭歪了脸，作出不以为然的样子，但还是接受了这一项一拖就是整整五天的提议，他不得不承认眼下他也想不出更好的法子，加上露丝与梅莱夫人又都极力支持布朗罗先生，这位绅士的提议获得一致通过。\n “我很想求得我朋友格林维格的帮助。”他说道，“他是一个怪人，但精明强干，或许能为我们提供具体的帮助。我应当说明一下，他学的是法律，因为二十年间只收到一份案情摘要和诉讼申请，一气之下退出了律师业，不过我这些话能不能算一份推荐书，要由你们大家决定。”\n “我不反对你向朋友求援，如果我也可以请我自己的朋友来的话。”大夫说。\n “我们必须将这件事付诸表决，”布朗罗先生回答，“是哪一位呢？”\n “那位夫人的儿子，也是这位小姐的――至交。”大夫说着，指指梅莱夫人，又附带着意味深长地瞅了一眼她的侄女方才住嘴。\n 露丝脸上一片通红，但却一言不发（她大概意识到，如果反对这项动议，自己就将处于毫无希望的少数），哈利梅莱与格林维格先生顺理成章地增补进了这个委员会。\n “不用说，只要还有一线希望，能够把这一项调查搞下去，我们就呆在伦敦好了，”梅莱大太说，“我们大家都对这件事如此关心，我也不会在乎劳神费事，计较花销，我心甘情愿留在这里，就算呆上一年半载吧，只要你们能叫我相信，事情还没有完全绝望。”\n “好极了。”布朗罗先生应声说道，“我看诸位的表情，大家都想问一问，我怎么会仓促出国，以至于在需要证明奥立弗的故事是否属实的时候，却找不到我了。容我明言在先，到了我认为适当的时机，不劳各位问起，我自会把我本人的故事奉献给大家，在此之前，请不要问我。相信我吧，我作出这一请求是有充分理由的，否则我也许会燃起一些注定无法实现的希望，只会增加已经多到无可计数的困难与失望。行了。晚餐已经开出来了，一直孤孤单单地守在隔壁房间里的小奥立弗，这功夫要开始动脑筋了，以为我们都不喜欢他了，正在策划什么恶毒的阴谋，要将他扫地出门呢。”\n 随着这番话，老绅士把一只手伸给梅莱太太，陪同她走进餐室。罗斯伯力先生领着露丝跟在后边。实际上，讨论会到此暂时告一段落。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/97/5097.html","bookId":474,"book":{"id":474,"title":"Oliver
