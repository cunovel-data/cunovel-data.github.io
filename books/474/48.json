{"id":22375,"no":48,"title":"Chapter 48","content":"THE FLIGHT OF SIKES Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London\u0027s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel. The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light! He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again. And there was the body--mere flesh and blood, no more--but such flesh, and so much blood! He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody. All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house. He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay nearly under there. _He_ knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot! The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away. He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept. Soon he was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but back towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed--then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches\u0027 brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again. Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people\u0027s way. Thither he directed his steps,--running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\u0027s pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when he got there, all the people he met--the very children at the doors--seemed to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go. He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield. It was nine o\u0027clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot. There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it. They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time. The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young--not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was--with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least--if he had taken care; if he had taken care. There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer. This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement. \u0027And what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?\u0027 asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner. \u0027This,\u0027 said the fellow, producing one, \u0027this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she\u0027s cured at once--for it\u0027s poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question--for it\u0027s quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!\u0027 There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity. \u0027It\u0027s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\u0027 said the fellow. \u0027There are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can\u0027t make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square! Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I\u0027ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.\u0027 \u0027Hah!\u0027 cried Sikes starting up. \u0027Give that back.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll take it clean out, sir,\u0027 replied the man, winking to the company, \u0027before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman\u0027s hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain--\u0027 The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house. With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office. He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened. The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement. \u0027That\u0027s for your people,\u0027 said the guard. \u0027Now, look alive in there, will you. Damn that \u0027ere bag, it warn\u0027t ready night afore last; this won\u0027t do, you know!\u0027 \u0027Anything new up in town, Ben?\u0027 asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses. \u0027No, nothing that I knows on,\u0027 replied the man, pulling on his gloves. \u0027Corn\u0027s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don\u0027t reckon much upon it.\u0027 \u0027Oh, that\u0027s quite true,\u0027 said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window. \u0027And a dreadful murder it was.\u0027 \u0027Was it, sir?\u0027 rejoined the guard, touching his hat. \u0027Man or woman, pray, sir?\u0027 \u0027A woman,\u0027 replied the gentleman. \u0027It is supposed--\u0027 \u0027Now, Ben,\u0027 replied the coachman impatiently. \u0027Damn that \u0027ere bag,\u0027 said the guard; \u0027are you gone to sleep in there?\u0027 \u0027Coming!\u0027 cried the office keeper, running out. \u0027Coming,\u0027 growled the guard. \u0027Ah, and so\u0027s the young \u0027ooman of property that\u0027s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\u0027t know when. Here, give hold. All ri--ight!\u0027 The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone. Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go. At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans. He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning\u0027s ghastly figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it followed--not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell. At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now--always. He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky. He threw himself upon the road--on his back upon the road. At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood. Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear. There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night. Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture. For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they were everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object--some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed place. The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along. And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air. The broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were people there--men and women--light, bustle. It was like new life to him. He darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him. He came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams. The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained. This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. \u0027He has gone to Birmingham, they say,\u0027 said one: \u0027but they\u0027ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there\u0027ll be a cry all through the country.\u0027 He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night. Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London. \u0027There\u0027s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\u0027 he thought. \u0027A good hiding-place, too. They\u0027ll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent. Why can\u0027t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I\u0027ll risk it.\u0027 He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination. The dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went. The animal looked up into his master\u0027s face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber\u0027s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright. \u0027Do you hear me call? Come here!\u0027 cried Sikes. The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back. \u0027Come back!\u0027 said the robber. The dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and called him again. The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed. The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey. 太阳――明朗的太阳，不仅给人类带来光明，还带来新的生命、期望与朝气――辉煌灿烂地展现在这座人烟稠密的都市上空，阳光一视同仁地穿透艳丽的彩色玻璃和纸糊的窗格，穿透教堂的圆顶和腐朽的缝隙。阳光照亮了横放着那个遇害女子的房间。确实照亮了。赛克斯曾妄想把光明挡在窗外，可阳光还是会照射进来的。如果说，这副情景即便是在阴暗的早晨也令人骇然，那么现在，当一切都披上了灿烂的日光，这又是一副什么光景啊！ 他一动不动，连走动一下都不敢。遇害者曾发出一声呻吟，手动了一下。他带着火头上新添的恐惧，又给了她一击，又是一击。他一度扔下一张毯子将尸体盖住梵经又称“吠檀多经”。梵文Brahmasūtra的意译。古代，然而一想到那双眼睛，想像它们冲着自己转过来，比起看见它们直瞪瞪地朝上看着，仿佛在看天花板上那一摊血迹的倒影在阳光下摇曳起舞似的，情况更糟。他又把毯子扯掉了。尸体躺在那里――无非是血和肉，只此而已――可那是什么样的肉，多么多的血啊！ 他划着火柴，生起炉子，将木棒扔在里边。木棒梢头上带着的头发烧着了，蜷缩成一小片薄灰，微风抓起它来，飘飘悠悠地飞进烟囱，就连这一点也把他吓坏了，尽管他是那样身强体壮。他抓住这件凶器，直到它断裂开来，随即扔在煤上，让它慢慢烧尽，化成了灰。他洗了洗手，把衣服擦擦干净，衣服上有几处血迹怎么也擦不掉，他索性把那几块剪下来，烧掉了。房间里的血迹怎么到处都是？连狗爪子上也都是血。 整个这段时间，他一次也没有背对尸体，是的，片刻也没有。一切部收拾好了，他退到门口，一边拉住狗，以免那畜生的爪子又一次沾上血迹，把新的罪证带到大街上。他轻轻地关门上锁，取下钥匙，离开了那所房子。 他走到马路对面，抬头瞅了瞅那扇窗户，必须保证外面什么也看不出来。窗帘纹丝不动地垂挂着，她本想拉开窗帘，让屋里亮一些革命实践的方向对黑格尔的概念和方法进行了改造。主张重，可她再也看不到亮光了。尸体几乎就横躺在窗帘下边。这一点他是知道的。天啦，阳光怎么偏偏往那个地方倾泻。 这一瞥只是一刹那的功夫。谢天谢地，总算脱离了那个房间。他冲着狗打了一声口哨，快步走开了。 他走过爱灵顿，大步朝高门山附近那座矗立着惠廷敦纪念碑的土坡走去，再到高门山。他一点主意没有，也不知道上哪儿去――刚一动身下山，便又朝右边插过去，抄小路穿过田野，绕过凯茵森林，来到汉普司泰德荒原。他涉过健康谷旁边的洼地，爬上对面的沙丘，横穿连接汉普司泰德和高门两处村庄的大道，沿着余下的一段荒原往北郊的田野走去，在田边一道篱笆底下躺下来，睡着了。 不多一会儿，他又起来，开始赶路――不是深入乡村，而是沿着大路返回伦敦――接着又倒回来――又从另一边朝他已经走过的那一带走去――时而在田野里游来荡去，时而躺在沟边歇一歇唯名论西欧中世纪经院哲学的派别之一。同唯实论相对，，时而又一跃而起，换一个地方躺下，随后又四处乱跑。 上什么地方弄点吃的喝的呢，既要近便，又要人不太多？亨顿。那是个好去处，路不远，又不怎么当道。他决定到那边去――有时疾走飞奔，有时出于一种奇怪的逆反心理，像蜗牛一样磨磨蹭蹭，或者索性停下来，懒洋洋地用手杖在篱笆上敲敲打打。可是到了那个地方，他遇见的每一个人――连站在门口的小孩也一样――好像都拿出一副怀疑的目光瞅着他似的。他只得转过身，没有胆量去买点吃的喝的，尽管他已经好几个小时没吃东西了。他又一次在荒原上游荡开了，不知道该上哪儿去。 他游荡了不知多少里路，又回到了老地方，早晨与中午已经过去了，白昼即将结束，他仍在东游西荡，上坡下坡，兜了一圈又一圈，始终在原地徘徊。末了，他拔腿往海菲尔德方向走去。 已经是夜里九点钟了，村子里一片宁静，那汉子浑身筋疲力尽，从教堂旁边的小山上走下来。狗也因少有这种训练走起来一瘸一拐。他们顺着狭窄的街道蹒跚而行，悄悄溜进一家小酒店比较哲学广义指研究哲学与其他学科同异关系的或对不，原来是店里暗淡的灯光将他们引到了这里。店堂里生着一炉火，有几个农民正围着火炉喝酒。他们替这位陌生人让出了一块地方，可他却在最远的角落里坐下来，独自吃喝，说得更确切一些，是和他的狗一起吃，他时不时地扔给那畜生一点儿吃的。 那几个聚在一块儿的人谈起了附近的土地与农民。这些话题说够了，又转而开始议论上礼拜天下葬的某个老头儿的岁数。在场的年轻人认为他很有一把年纪了，而几个老头子却宣称他还年轻呢――一位满头白发的老公公说，死者并不比自己年长――要是他好好保养，至少还可以活十年到十五年――要是好好保养的话。 这个话题没有什么引人入胜或者说激起恐慌的内容。那强盗付了账，不声不响地坐在角落里，无人注意，差一点睡着了。就在这时，一位不速之客进门的嘈杂声将他的睡意多少赶走了一些。 来者是一个喜欢插科打诨的小贩兼江湖骗子，背上挂着一口箱子，周游四乡，兜售磨刀石、磨刀皮带、剃刀、洗面水、马具粘合剂、治狗病和治马病的药、廉价香水、化妆品什么的。他一进店门，就跟几个乡下人有说有笑《管子心术》认为：“道在天地之间也，其大无外，其小无，无伤大雅地相互逗乐，等他吃饱喝足了，又来了个顺水推舟，打开百宝箱，一边开玩笑，一边做起了生意。 “那是什么玩意儿？好吃不好吃，哈利？”一个乡下人嘻皮笑脸地指着箱子角落里的几块形状像糕点的东西问道。 “这个嘛，”那家伙拿起一块来，说道，“这就是那种百灵百验、物超所值的合成肥皂，专去各种丝绸、缎子、亚麻布、麻纱、棉布、绉纱、呢绒。毛毯、混纺织物、平纹细布、羊毛织品上的斑点、锈迹、污渍、霉点。任何迹印，不管是啤酒迹印、葡萄酒渍、水果渍、水渍、色斑，还是沥青迹印，用这种百灵百验、物超所值的合成肥皂，擦一下管保全部褪尽。若是哪位女士名誉上有了污点，只要吞一块下去，立刻药到病除――这可是毒药呢。如果哪一位绅士有心证明自己的清白，只需要咽一小块，从此名声就不成问题――因为这玩意儿简直跟手枪子弹一样令人称心如意，而且味道差了许多，结果当然是名声大振。一便士一块。有这么多的好处，只卖一便士一块。” 当场便有了两位买主，更多的听众显然也动心了。小贩见此情形，叫得更起劲了。 “这玩意儿一造出来，立刻抢购一空，”那家伙说道，“眼下有十四座水磨，六部蒸汽机，还有一组伏打电池，一直开足马力生产，还是供应不上。那些人可卖力了，累死了马上给寡妇发抚恤金，一个孩子每年二十镑，双胞胎五十镑。一便士一块啊。半便士的收两个也是一样，四分之一便士的四个就更欢迎了。一便士一块。专去各种酒类污渍、水果污渍、啤酒污渍、水渍、油漆、沥青、泥浆、血迹。在座一位先生帽子上就有一个迹印，他还没有来得及请我喝一品脱淡啤酒，我就已经擦掉它了。” “嗨！”赛克斯大叫一声，跳了起来，“把帽子还我。” “先生，你还没来得及走到房间这边来拿帽子，”小贩朝众人挤了挤眼，答道，“我就可以把它擦得干干净净。各位先生注意了，这位先生帽子上有一块深色的迹印，大不过一个先令，却比一个半克朗硬币还要厚。不管是酒渍、水果渍、水渍、油漆、沥青、泥浆，还是血迹――” 那人没能再说下去，因为赛克斯发出一声刺耳的咒骂，掀翻桌子，劈手夺过帽子，冲出酒店去了。 反常的精神状态，内心的举棋不定，是由不得这个凶手的，已经整整折磨了他一天。这时他发觉后面没有人追上来，人们顶多也就是把他当成一个憋着股子火气的醉汉罢了。他转身离开小镇。街上停着一辆邮车，他避开车灯的光亮走过去，认出这是伦敦开来的驿车，正停在那所小小的邮局前边。他差不多猜得到接下来会出现什么情况，却还是走到马路对面，凝神谛听着。 押车的职员站在车门口，正在等邮袋，一个穿着像是猎场看守员的男人走上前去，押运员将已经放在便道上的一个篮子递给他。 “这是给你家里人的，”押运员说道，“喂，里边的人手脚快一点好不好？这该死的邮袋，前天晚上都还没弄好，这样是不行的，你不是不知道。” “贝恩，城里有啥新闻？”猎场看守一边问一边往窗板退去，这样更便于欣赏一下那几匹马。 “没有，据我所知没什么新闻，”押运员戴上手套，答道，“粮价涨了一点儿。我听说斯皮达菲那一带也出了一起凶杀案，不过我不大相信。” “噢，一点不假，”一位打车窗里往外张望的绅士说道，“真是一起可怕的凶杀。” “是吗，先生？”押运员触了一下帽子，问道，“劳您驾，先生，是男的还是女的？” “一个女人，”绅士回答，“据估计――” “得了吧，贝恩。”赶车人不耐烦地嚷了起来。 “这该死的邮袋，”押运员嚷嚷着，“你们里边的人是睡着了不是？” “来啦！”邮局职员跑出来，嚷了一声。 “来啦，”押运员咕哝着，“啊，跟那位千金小姐一样，说是马上就要爱上我了，可我就是不知道什么时候兑现。行了，开车。好――哩！” 驿车喇叭发出几个欢快的音符，车开走了。 赛克斯依旧站在街上，对刚才听到的一席话显然无动于衷。他只是不知道该往哪儿走，没有比这更叫他恼火的了。末了，他又一次往回走去，踏上了从海菲尔德通往圣阿尔班斯的大道。 他闷头闷脑地往前走。可是，当他把小镇抛在身后，来到空荡荡、黑沉沉的的大路上，就有一种恐怖的感觉悄悄爬上心头，他浑身里里外外都哆嗦起来。眼前的每一个物体，不管是实物还是阴影，不管是静的还是动的，全都很像某种可怕的东西。然而，这些恐惧比起那个从清晨以来与他寸步不离的怪影就算不得什么了。朦胧中，他分辨得出它的影子，说得出最细微的特征，记得它是怎样身体僵直、面孔冷峻地行走的。他听得到它的衣服擦着树叶沙沙作响，每一阵微风都会送来那最后一声低沉的惨叫。他如果停下，影子也停下。他如果疾走飞奔，影子也紧随在后――它并不跑――真要是跑倒还好些，而是像一具仅仅赋有生命机理的躯体，由一股既不增强也不停息的阴风在后面缓缓地推动。 他几次把心一横转过身来，决心把这个幻影赶走，哪怕它会下死劲地瞅着自己，却不由得毛骨悚然，连血液也凝滞了：因为幻影也随着自己一起转过来，又跑到身后去了。上午他一直是面对着它，而眼下它就在自己身后――寸步不离。他如果背靠土坡，便会感到它悬在头上，寒冷的夜空清晰地映出它的轮廓。他仰天倒在路上――背贴着路面，它就直挺挺地站在他的头上，一言不发，一动不动――一块活生生的墓碑，刻有用鲜血写下的墓志铭。 谁也不要说什么凶手可以逍遥法外，老天没长眼睛。这样提心吊胆地熬过漫长的一分钟，与横死几百回也差不了多少。 他经过的野地里有一个茅棚，提供了过夜的栖身之所。小屋门前长着三棵高大的杨树，里边一片漆黑，晚风卷着一阵悲凉的哭泣声呜呜咽咽地刮过树梢。天亮以前，他没法再走了。他直挺挺地紧贴墙根躺着――等来的却是新的折磨。 这时候，一个幻影出现在他的面前，与他躲开的那个一样顽固，但更加可怕。一片黑暗之中，出现了一双睁得大大的眼睛，那样暗淡，那样呆滞，他宁可眼睁睁地看着它们，也不愿让它们走进自己的想像。眼睛本身在闪光，却没有照亮任何东西。眼睛只有两只，可它们无处不在。如果他合上双眼，脑海里便会出现那个房间，每一样东西都是熟悉的――的确，如果让他凭记忆将屋里的东西过一遍的话，有几样也许还想不起来――一件一件全在各自的老地方。那具尸体仍在它原来的地方，眼睛与他偷偷溜走时看见的一样。他一跃而起，冲进屋外的野地里。那个影子又跟上他了。他又一次走进小屋，钻到角落里。他还没来得及躺下，那双眼睛又出现了。 他呆在这地方，唯有他才清楚自己是多么恐惧，他手脚捉对儿地打着哆嗦，冷汗从每一个毛孔涌出来。突然，晚风中腾起一阵喧闹声，喊声叫声在远处响成一片，其中交织着慌乱与惊愕。在这个凄凉冷落的地方听到人的声响，即便真正是不祥的预兆，对于他也是一大安慰。危险临头，他又有了力量与精神，他猛然跳起来，冲到门外的旷野里。 广阔的天空像是着了火。一片高过一片的火头挟着阵雨般的火星，旋转着冲天而起，点亮了方圆几英里的天空，把一团团浓烟朝他站的方向驱赶过来。又有新的声音加入了呐喊，呼声更高了。他听得出那是一片呼喊“失火了！”喊声中混合着警钟鸣响，重物倒塌，火柱爆裂的声音。烈焰围住一个新的障碍物，火舌箭一般蹿起来，像是补充了食物似的。在他远远旁观的当儿，喧闹声越来越嘈杂，那边有人――男的女的都有――火光熊熊，人来人往。这情景在他看来如同是一种新的生活。他飞奔过去――直端端的，一头冲了过去――冲过荆棘灌丛，跃过栅栏和篱笆，和他那条汪汪地高声吠叫着跑在前边的狗一样像是发了疯。 他赶到现场。衣冠不整的人影往来狂奔，有几个人正拚命把受惊的马从马厩里拉出来，另一些人在把牛群从院子和草棚里轰出去，还有一些顶着纷飞的火星，冒着烧得通红的屋梁滚落下来的危险，从燃烧的木桩、柱子当中往外搬东西。一小时前还有门有窗的地方张开大日，吐出团团烈火，墙壁摇摇晃晃，坍塌在燃烧的火井里。铅和铁熔化了，白热的液体倾泻到地上。女人、小孩在尖声喊叫，男人们用喧闹的吆喝与欢呼相互壮胆。救火泵哐卿哐啷，水声哗哗，溅落在滚烫的木板上，发出咝咝的声音，汇成一片可怕的喧嚣声。他也跟着吆喝起来，直到喊哑了嗓子。他摆脱了记忆，也摆脱了他自己，一头扎进了最稠密的人群之中。 这一夜，他东冲西闯，一会儿用救火泵抽水，一会儿在浓烟烈火中奔忙，从不让自己脱离声音和人群最稠密的地方。他跑上跑下，爬梯子，上房顶，穿楼层，不顾在他的重压下颤颤悠悠的地板，冒着掉落下来的砖石，在大火蔓延的每一个地方都有他的身影。然而，他真是生了一副鬼神庇护的命，身上没有落下一丝擦伤，也没有碰着压着，没有感到疲倦，脑子里空空如也，一直于到又一个黎明到来，火场上只剩下缕缕烟雾和黑乎乎的废墟。 疯狂的亢奋过去了，那个可怕的意识带着十倍的威力去而复返，他明白自己犯下了大罪。他疑神疑鬼地看了看四周，因为人们都在三五成群地交谈，他担心自己会成为谈话的主题。他用指头发出了一个意味深长的手势，狗领会了。他俩偷偷地走开了。他贴着一台发动机走过，有几个人正坐在那儿，他们招呼他一块儿吃点东西。他胡乱吃了些面包和肉食，一口啤酒刚喝下肚，便听见几个伦敦来的救火员正在议论那极凶杀案。“听人说，他逃到伯明翰去了，”其中一个说道，“他们照样会抓住他的，侦探已经出发了，到明儿晚上通缉令就会发到全国。” 他慌忙走开，一直走到险些儿跌倒在地才停下来。接着，他在一条小路上躺下来，睡了很久，但断断续续，很不安稳。他又一次起来游荡，犹豫不决，不知何去何从，担心又得挨过一个孤寂的夜晚。 猛然间，他不顾一切地作出了决定：回伦敦去。 “不管怎么样，上那儿总有人可以说说话，”他思忖道，“又是一个呱呱叫的藏身之地。我在乡下留了那么多痕迹，他们决不会想到回伦敦抓我。我干吗不能躲上个把礼拜，然后，从费金身上硬讨一笔现钱，跑到法国去？妈的，我豁出去了。” 在这个念头驱使下，他毫不耽搁地开始行动，选择行人最少的路径动身往回走去，打定主意在首都近郊先躲一躲，等天黑下来，再绕道进入伦敦，直奔选定的目的地。 然而，狗是个问题。如果他的长相特征已经发往各地的话，肯定不会漏掉一条，那就是狗也不见了，很可能是跟他在一块儿。这一点可能导致他在穿街走巷的时候被捕。他决定把狗淹死。他朝前走去，四下里寻找池塘。他拾起一块大石头，边走边把石头系在手绢上。 这些准备工作正在进行的时候，那畜生抬起头来，望着主人的面孔。不知是它凭本能悟出兆头不妙，还是因为那强盗斜眼看它的目光比平常更凶了一些，它躲躲闪闪地走在后边，距离拉得比往常远一些，他一放慢脚步，狗就畏缩不前。主人在一个水池边上停下来，回头唤它，它干脆不走了。 “听见我唤你没有？上这儿来！”赛克斯喝道。 那富生在习惯驱使下走上前来。可是，当赛克斯俯下身来，将手绢往它脖子上套的时候，它却呜呜叫了一声，跳开了。 “回来！”那强盗说道。 狗摇了摇尾巴，但没有动弹。赛克斯打了一个活套，又一次唤它过来。 狗上前几步，又退回去，踌躇片刻，便转身以最快速度逃走了。 那汉子一次又一次地打着唿哨，坐下来等候着，满以为它还会回来，然而狗再也没有露面，他只好重新踏上旅途。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/97/5104.html","bookId":474,"book":{"id":474,"title":"Oliver Twist雾都孤儿","description":"简介：
