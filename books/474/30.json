{"id":22357,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"RELATES WHAT OLIVER\u0027S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM \\n\\n With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\u0027s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs. \\n\\n \u0027Now,\u0027 said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door, \u0027let us hear what you think of him. He has not been shaved very recently, but he don\u0027t look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting order.\u0027 \\n\\n Stepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow. \\n\\n The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver\u0027s hair from his face. As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead. \\n\\n The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall. \\n\\n \u0027What can this mean?\u0027 exclaimed the elder lady. \u0027This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Vice,\u0027 said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \u0027takes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027But at so early an age!\u0027 urged Rose. \\n\\n \u0027My dear young lady,\u0027 rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; \u0027crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone. The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027But, can you--oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\u0027 said Rose. \\n\\n The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment. \\n\\n \u0027But even if he has been wicked,\u0027 pursued Rose, \u0027think how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother\u0027s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy\u0027s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027My dear love,\u0027 said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, \u0027do you think I would harm a hair of his head?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, no!\u0027 replied Rose, eagerly. \\n\\n \u0027No, surely,\u0027 said the old lady; \u0027my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Let me think, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said the doctor; \u0027let me think.\u0027 \\n\\n Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of \u0027I\u0027ve got it now\u0027 and \u0027no, I haven\u0027t,\u0027 and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows: \\n\\n \u0027I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don\u0027t object to that?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,\u0027 replied Mrs. Maylie. \\n\\n \u0027There is no other,\u0027 said the doctor. \u0027No other, take my word for it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Then my aunt invests you with full power,\u0027 said Rose, smiling through her tears; \u0027but pray don\u0027t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You seem to think,\u0027 retorted the doctor, \u0027that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\u0027 returned Rose, blushing. \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said the doctor, laughing heartily, \u0027that is no very difficult matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn\u0027t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation--that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh no, aunt!\u0027 entreated Rose. \\n\\n \u0027Oh yes, aunt!\u0027 said the doctor. \u0027Is is a bargain?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027He cannot be hardened in vice,\u0027 said Rose; \u0027It is impossible.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Very good,\u0027 retorted the doctor; \u0027then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.\u0027 \\n\\n Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake. \\n\\n The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done. \\n\\n The conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men\u0027s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\u0027s life brings with it! \\n\\n Oliver\u0027s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur. \\n\\n The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went. \\n\\n There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale--as indeed he had. \\n\\n The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it. \\n\\n \u0027Sit still!\u0027 said the doctor, waving his hand. \\n\\n \u0027Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles. \u0027Misses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \u0027em here.\u0027 \\n\\n Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles\u0027s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them. \\n\\n \u0027How is the patient to-night, sir?\u0027 asked Giles. \\n\\n \u0027So-so\u0027; returned the doctor. \u0027I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I hope you don\u0027t mean to say, sir,\u0027 said Mr. Giles, trembling, \u0027that he\u0027s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn\u0027t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not the point,\u0027 said the doctor, mysteriously. \u0027Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir, I hope so,\u0027 faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale. \\n\\n \u0027And what are _you_, boy?\u0027 said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles. \\n\\n \u0027Lord bless me, sir!\u0027 replied Brittles, starting violently; \u0027I\u0027m the same as Mr. Giles, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Then tell me this,\u0027 said the doctor, \u0027both of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We are prepared for you!\u0027 \\n\\n The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction. \\n\\n \u0027Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\u0027 said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\u0027s utmost acuteness. \u0027Something may come of this before long.\u0027 \\n\\n The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\u0027 said the doctor. \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what it is, sir,\u0027 replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way. \\n\\n \u0027Here\u0027s the house broken into,\u0027 said the doctor, \u0027and a couple of men catch one moment\u0027s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here\u0027s a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him--by doing which, they place his life in great danger--and swear he is the thief. Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?\u0027 \\n\\n The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn\u0027t law, he would be glad to know what was. \\n\\n \u0027I ask you again,\u0027 thundered the doctor, \u0027are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?\u0027 \\n\\n Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the runners!\u0027 cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved. \\n\\n \u0027The what?\u0027 exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn. \\n\\n \u0027The Bow Street officers, sir,\u0027 replied Brittles, taking up a candle; \u0027me and Mr. Giles sent for \u0027em this morning.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 cried the doctor. \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 replied Brittles; \u0027I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren\u0027t here before, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You did, did you? Then confound your--slow coaches down here; that\u0027s all,\u0027 said the doctor, walking away. \\n\\n “现在，”大夫轻轻转动卧室门上的把手，小声地说，“我们还是不妨听听你们对他印象如何吧。他好些日子没有理发了，不过看上去倒还一点也不凶恶。等等！让我先看看他是不是可以探视。”\\n\\n 大夫跨前几步，朝房间里望了望，然后示意她们跟上，等她们一进来，大夫便关上门斯宾塞（HerbertSpencer，1820―1903）英国哲学家、社，轻轻撩开床帘。床上躺着的并不是她们所预想的那么一个冥顽不化、凶神恶煞的歹徒，只是一个在伤痛疲劳困扰下陷入沉睡的孩子。他那受了伤的胳臂缠着绷带，用夹板固定起来搁在胸口上，头靠在另一条手臂上，长长的头发技散在枕头上，把这条手臂遮去了一半。\\n\\n 这位好心的绅士一手拉住床罩，默不作声地看了一分钟左右。正当他如此专注地打量着病人的时候，年轻小姐缓缓走到近旁，在床边一张椅子上坐下来，拨开奥立弗脸上的头发。她朝奥立弗俯下身去，几颗泪珠滴落在他的额头上。\\n\\n 孩子动了一下，在睡梦中发出微笑，仿佛这些怜悯的表示唤起了某种令人愉快的梦境，那里有他从未领略过的爱心与温情。有的时候，一支亲切的乐曲，一处幽静地方的潺潺水声，一朵花的芳香，甚而只是说出一个熟悉的字眼，会突然唤起一些模糊的记忆，令人想起一些今生不曾出现过的场景，它们会像微风一样飘散，仿佛刹那间唤醒了对某种久已别离的、比较快乐的往事，而这种回忆单靠冥思苦想是怎么也想不起来的。\\n\\n “这是怎么回事？”老太太大声说道，“这可怜的孩子绝不可能是一帮强盗的徒弟。”\\n\\n “罪恶，”大夫长叹一声，放下帘子，“在许多神圣的场所都可以藏身。谁能说一具漂亮的外表就不会包藏祸心？”\\n\\n “可他还这么小呢。”露丝直抒己见。\\n\\n “我亲爱的小姐，”大夫悲哀地摇了摇头，回答说，“犯罪，如同死亡一样，并不是单单照顾年老体弱的人。最年轻最漂亮的也经常成为它选中的牺牲品。”\\n\\n “不过，你就――噢！难道你真的相信，这个瘦弱的孩子自愿充当那些社会渣滓的帮手？”露丝问。\\n\\n 大夫摇了摇头，意思是他担心事情完全可能就是这样。他指出他们可能会打扰病人，便领头走进隔壁房间。\\n\\n “就算他干过坏事，”露丝不肯松口，“想想他是多么幼稚，想想他也许从来就没得到过母爱或家庭的温暖。虐待，毒打，或者是对面包的需求，都会驱使他跟那些逼着他干坏事的人混在一块儿。姑妈，亲爱的姑妈，让他们把这个正在生病的孩子投进监狱之前您可千万要想一想，不管怎么说，一进监狱他肯定就没有机会改邪归正了。呃！您爱我，您也知道，由于您的仁慈与爱心，我从来没有感觉到自己失去了父母，可我也是有可能于出同样的事，跟这个苦命的小孩一样无依无靠，得不到呵护的，趁现在还来得及，您可怜可怜他吧。”\\n\\n “我亲爱的小宝贝儿。”老太太把声泪俱下的姑娘搂在怀里。“你以为我会伤害他头上的一根头发吗？”\\n\\n “哦，不！”露丝急迫地回答道。\\n\\n “不会的，肯定不会，”老太太说，“我已经来日无多，怜悯别人也就等于宽恕自己。如果要救他，我能做些什么，先生？”\\n\\n “让我想想，夫人，”大夫说道，“让我想一想。”\\n\\n 罗斯伯力先生把双手插进衣袋，在屋子里踱来踱去，他不时停下来，用脚跟调整一下身体的平衡，蹩起额头的样子怪吓人的。他发出各种各样的感慨，诸如“现在有办法了。”“不，还没呢。”并且多次重新开始踱方步、皱眉头，最后，他一动不动地停住了，说出了以下这一番话：\\n\\n “我认为，只要您全权委托我去吓唬凯尔司和那个小伙子布里特尔斯，不加任何限制，这事我就能办到。凯尔司忠心耿耿，又是家里的老仆，这我知道。不过您有上千种办法来对他进行补偿，此外还可以奖赏奖赏像他这样一个好射手。您不反对这样做吧？”\\n\\n “要想保护这个孩子，又没有别的办法。”梅莱太太答道。\\n\\n “没有别的办法，”大夫说，“没有，您相信我好了。”\\n\\n “既然这样，姑妈就全权委托你了，”露丝破涕为笑，“但除非万不得已，请不要过分难为他们几个。”\\n\\n “你似乎认为，”大夫回道，“露丝小姐，今天在场的每一位，除了你本人而外，都是铁石心肠吧。一般说来，为了成长中的全体男性着想，我希望，当第一个够格的年轻人求你施以怜悯的时候，你也是这样面慈心软，可惜我不是年轻人，否则我一定当场抓住眼前这样有利的机会，我一定会那样做的。”\\n\\n “你和可怜的布里特尔斯一样是个大孩子。”露丝红着脸答道。\\n\\n “好啊，”大夫开心地笑了起来。“那决不是什么特别困难的事。还是回头谈谈那个孩子，咱们还没谈到协议的要点呢。过一小时左右他就会醒过来，我敢担保。虽然我已经跟楼下那个死脑筋的警察老弟说了，病人不能搬动或者说话，那会有生命危险，我们大概还是可以跟他淡谈，没有什么危险。现在，我答应――我当着你们的面对们的面对他进行审查，就是说，根据他说的话，我们能作出判断，而且我可以让你们通过冷静的理智看清楚，他本来就是一个不折不扣的坏蛋（这种可能性比较大），那么，他就只能听天由命了，在任何情况下，我也不再插手这事了。”\\n\\n “哦，不，姑妈！”露丝恳求道。\\n\\n “噢，是的，姑妈！”大夫说，“这是一种交易？”\\n\\n “他不会堕落成坏蛋的，”露丝说道，“这不可能。”\\n\\n “好极了，”大夫反驳道，“那就更有理由接受我的建议了。”\\n\\n 最后，条约商议停当了，几个人坐下来，焦躁不安地期待着奥立弗苏醒过来。\\n\\n 两位女士的耐性注定要经历的考验，比罗斯伯力先生向她们所预言的还要难熬，时间一小时接一小时地过去了，奥立弗依然沉睡未醒。一点不假，已经到了黄昏时分，好心的大夫才带来消息，他总算醒过来了，可以和他谈话。大夫说，那孩子病得厉害，因为失血而非常虚弱，但他心里很烦躁，急于吐露一件什么事，大夫个人认为与其非得要他保持安静，等到第二天早上再说，不如给他这样一个机会，他反正是要讲出来的。\\n\\n 谈话进行了很长时间。奥立弗一五一十地把自己的简短身世告诉了他们，由于疼痛和精力不足，他常常不得不停下来。在一间变得昏暗的屋子里，听这个生病的孩子用微弱的声音倾诉那些狠心的人给他带来的千灾百难，真是一件庄严神圣的事情。呵！当我们压迫蹂躏自己的同类时，我们何不想一想，人类作孽的罪证如同浓重的阴云，尽管升腾十分缓慢，但难逃天网，最后总有恶报倾注到我们头上――我们何不在想像中听一听死者发出悲愤的控诉，任何力量也无法压制，任何尊严也无法封锁的控诉――哪怕只是稍微想一想，听一听，那么每天每日的生活所带来的伤害、不义、磨难、痛苦、暴行和冤屈，哪里还会有落脚之处！\\n\\n 那天夜里，一双双亲切的手抚平了奥立弗的枕头，在睡梦中，美与善看护着他。他的心又平静又快乐，就是死去也毫无怨尤。\\n\\n 这一次重要的会见刚一结束，奥立弗定下心来，大夫立刻揉了揉眼睛，同时责怪这双眼睛真是不管用了，然后起身下楼，开导凯尔司先生去了。他发现客厅里里外外一个人也没有，不禁想到在厨房里着手进行这些工作可能效果更好一些，就走进了厨房。\\n\\n 在这个家宅议会的下议院里聚会的有：女仆、布里特尔斯先生、凯尔司先生、补锅匠（考虑到他出了不少力，特别邀请他接受当天的盛宴款待），还有那位警官。最后一位绅士脑袋很大，大鼻子大眼，佩着一根粗大的警棍，外加一双大大的半统靴，看来他好像正在享受相应的啤酒份额――事情的确也是这样。\\n\\n 议题仍然是前一天夜里的惊险故事。大夫进去的功夫，凯尔司先生正在细说他当时如何沉着镇静，临危不乱。布里特尔斯先生手里端着一杯啤酒，不等上司把话说完，便担保句句话都是真的。\\n\\n “坐下坐下。”大夫说着挥了挥手。\\n\\n “谢谢，先生，”凯尔司先生说道，“太太、小姐吩咐大家喝点啤酒，我想根本用不着老是猫在我自个儿的小屋里，先生，有心陪陪大家，就到这儿来了。”\\n\\n 由布里特尔斯带头，在场的女士先生们大都低声咕哝了几句，对凯尔司先生大驾光临表示领情。凯尔司先生面带一副保护人的气派，向全场巡视了一周，好像是说只要他们表现良好，他绝不会对他们甩手不管的。\\n\\n “今天晚上病人的情况怎么样，先生？”凯尔司问道。\\n\\n “也就那样，”大夫答道，“你恐怕惹了麻烦了，凯尔司先生。”\\n\\n “我相信您的意思并不是说，先生，”凯尔司先生打起哆嗦来了。“他快死了。只要我想到这档子事，我这辈子就别想好过了。我不想开销一个孩子，是的，在这一点上，即便是布里特尔斯也不会的――哪怕把全郡所有的餐具给我，我也不干，先生。”\\n\\n “那倒不成问题，”大夫含糊不清地说，“凯尔司先生，你是新教徒吧？”\\n\\n “是啊，先生，我相信是的。”凯尔司先生的脸变得一片煞白，支支吾吾地说。\\n\\n “那么你呢，孩子？”大夫骤然转向布里特尔斯，问道。\\n\\n “上帝保佑，先生。”布里特尔斯一下子跳了起来。“我跟――跟凯尔司先生一样，先生。”\\n\\n “那你们告诉我，”大夫说道，“你们俩，你们二位。你们可不可以发誓，楼上的那个孩子就是昨天晚上给人从小窗户里塞进来的那一个？说啊！快说！我们等着你们回答呢。”\\n\\n 大家公认，大夫是世界上脾气最好的人，他居然以这样吓人的愤怒口气，提出这样一个问题，已经让啤酒和兴奋搞得晕头转向的凯尔司和布里特尔斯大眼瞪小眼，不知如何是好。\\n\\n “警官，请注意他俩的回答，可以吗？”大夫极其严肃地摇了摇食指，又点了一下自己的鼻梁骨，提请那位大人物拿出最大限度的观察力。“这事很快就要有点眉目了。”\\n\\n 警官尽量摆出精明的样子，同时拿起了一直闲置在壁炉一角的警棍。\\n\\n “你看得出来，这是一个简单的鉴定问题。”大夫说。\\n\\n “是这么回事，先生。”警察刚一回答，就拼命咳嗽起来，匆忙中他想把啤酒喝完，结果有一部分啤酒走岔了道。\\n\\n “有人闯进了这房子，”大夫说道，“有两个人曾在刹那间瞥见一个孩子，当时硝烟弥漫，大家心慌意乱，又是一片漆黑。第二天早晨，这所房子来了一个小孩，因为他碰巧又把胳膊吊起来了，这几个人对他大打出手――从而使他的生命处于极度危险之中――还发誓说他就是那个贼。现在的问题是，根据事实，这两个人的行为是否正当，如果属于不正当行为，他们又把自己置于何种境地？”\\n\\n 警察意味深长地点了点头，说如果这还不算合理合法的问题，那么他倒很想见识一下什么才算。\\n\\n “我再问你们一次，”大夫的声音像打雷一样。“你们俩郑重发誓，你们到底能不能指证那个孩子？”\\n\\n 布里特尔斯大惑不解地看着凯尔司先生，凯尔司先生也大惑不解地看着布里特尔斯，警察将一只手放在耳朵后边，等着听他俩的回答。两个女仆和补锅匠欠起身子倾听着。大夫用犀利的目光环顾四周――就在这时，大门口传来一阵铃声，同时响起了车轮滚动的声音。\\n\\n “准是巡捕来了。”布里特尔斯大声宣布，他显然大大松了一口气。\\n\\n “什么什么？”大夫嚷嚷着，现在轮到他发呆了。\\n\\n “波雾街①来的警探，”布里特尔斯举起一支蜡烛，回答说。“今天上午我和凯尔司先生托人去请他们来的。”——\\n\\n ①伦敦一街名，轻罪法庭所在地。\\n\\n “什么？”大夫大叫一声。\\n\\n “是的，”布里特尔斯回答，“我让车夫捎了个信去，先前我一直很奇怪他们怎么没上这儿来，先生。”\\n\\n “你们干的，是你们干的？你们这些该死的――马车怎么才到，这样慢，我没什么可说的了。”大夫说罢便走开了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/97/5086.html","bookId":474,"book":{"id":474,"title":"Oliver
