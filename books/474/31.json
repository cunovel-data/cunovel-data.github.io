{"id":22358,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION \\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s that?\u0027 inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand. \\n\\n \u0027Open the door,\u0027 replied a man outside; \u0027it\u0027s the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to to-day.\u0027 \\n\\n Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there. \\n\\n \u0027Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\u0027 said the officer; \u0027he\u0027s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach \u0027us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\u0027 \\n\\n Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were. \\n\\n The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose. \\n\\n \u0027Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\u0027 said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table. \u0027Oh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?\u0027 \\n\\n This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door. \\n\\n \u0027This is the lady of the house,\u0027 said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie. \\n\\n Mr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it--one of the two--seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment. \\n\\n \u0027Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,\u0027 said Blathers. \u0027What are the circumstances?\u0027 \\n\\n Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod. \\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\u0027 said Blathers; \u0027but my opinion at once is,--I don\u0027t mind committing myself to that extent,--that this wasn\u0027t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Certainly not,\u0027 replied Duff. \\n\\n \u0027And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?\u0027 said Mr. Losberne, with a smile. \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s it, master,\u0027 replied Blathers. \u0027This is all about the robbery, is it?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027All,\u0027 replied the doctor. \\n\\n \u0027Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?\u0027 said Blathers. \\n\\n \u0027Nothing at all,\u0027 replied the doctor. \u0027One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it\u0027s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Wery easy disposed of, if it is,\u0027 remarked Duff. \\n\\n \u0027What he says is quite correct,\u0027 observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. \u0027Who is the boy? What account does he give of himself? Where did he come from? He didn\u0027t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies. \u0027I know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Blathers. \u0027We had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That\u0027s the usual way of doing business.\u0027 \\n\\n Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night\u0027s adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child\u0027s play. \\n\\n Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces. \\n\\n \u0027Upon my word,\u0027 he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, \u0027I hardly know what to do.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Surely,\u0027 said Rose, \u0027the poor child\u0027s story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I doubt it, my dear young lady,\u0027 said the doctor, shaking his head. \u0027I don\u0027t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say? A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You believe it, surely?\u0027 interrupted Rose. \\n\\n \u0027_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,\u0027 rejoined the doctor; \u0027but I don\u0027t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027 demanded Rose. \\n\\n \u0027Because, my pretty cross-examiner,\u0027 replied the doctor: \u0027because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\u0027s pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\u0027s house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\u0027t you see all this?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I see it, of course,\u0027 replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\u0027s impetuosity; \u0027but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 replied the doctor; \u0027of course not! Bless the bright eyes of your sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.\u0027 \\n\\n Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before. \\n\\n \u0027The more I think of it,\u0027 said the doctor, \u0027the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy\u0027s real story. I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh! what is to be done?\u0027 cried Rose. \u0027Dear, dear! why did they send for these people?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why, indeed!\u0027 exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. \u0027I would not have had them here, for the world.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027All I know is,\u0027 said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, \u0027that we must try and carry it off with a bold face. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that\u0027s one comfort. We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, master,\u0027 said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. \u0027This warn\u0027t a put-up thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027And what the devil\u0027s a put-up thing?\u0027 demanded the doctor, impatiently. \\n\\n \u0027We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,\u0027 said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\u0027s, \u0027when the servants is in it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nobody suspected them, in this case,\u0027 said Mrs. Maylie. \\n\\n \u0027Wery likely not, ma\u0027am,\u0027 replied Blathers; \u0027but they might have been in it, for all that.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027More likely on that wery account,\u0027 said Duff. \\n\\n \u0027We find it was a town hand,\u0027 said Blathers, continuing his report; \u0027for the style of work is first-rate.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Wery pretty indeed it is,\u0027 remarked Duff, in an undertone. \\n\\n \u0027There was two of \u0027em in it,\u0027 continued Blathers; \u0027and they had a boy with \u0027em; that\u0027s plain from the size of the window. That\u0027s all to be said at present. We\u0027ll see this lad that you\u0027ve got upstairs at once, if you please.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?\u0027 said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him. \\n\\n \u0027Oh! to be sure!\u0027 exclaimed Rose, eagerly. \u0027You shall have it immediately, if you will.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why, thank you, miss!\u0027 said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; \u0027it\u0027s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that\u0027s handy, miss; don\u0027t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What shall it be?\u0027 asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard. \\n\\n \u0027A little drop of spirits, master, if it\u0027s all the same,\u0027 replied Blathers. \u0027It\u0027s a cold ride from London, ma\u0027am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\u0027 \\n\\n This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room. \\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; \u0027I have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\u0027 said Mr. Duff, assisting his colleague\u0027s memory. \\n\\n \u0027That was something in this way, warn\u0027t it?\u0027 rejoined Mr. Blathers; \u0027that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You always gave that to him\u0027 replied Duff. \u0027It was the Family Pet, I tell you. Conkey hadn\u0027t any more to do with it than I had.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Get out!\u0027 retorted Mr. Blathers; \u0027I know better. Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was! Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What was that?\u0027 inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors. \\n\\n \u0027It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,\u0027 said Blathers. \u0027This here Conkey Chickweed--\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Conkey means Nosey, ma\u0027am,\u0027 interposed Duff. \\n\\n \u0027Of course the lady knows that, don\u0027t she?\u0027 demanded Mr. Blathers. \u0027Always interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I\u0027ve seen \u0027em off\u0027en. He warn\u0027t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about \u0027em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \u0027em. However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\u0027t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house. \"I see him, Spyers,\" said Chickweed, \"pass my house yesterday morning,\" \"Why didn\u0027t you up, and collar him!\" says Spyers. \"I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\" says the poor man; \"but we\u0027re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o\u0027clock at night he passed again.\" Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\u0027s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, \"Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\" Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, \"Thieves!\" and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \"Which is the man?\" \"D--me!\" says Chickweed, \"I\u0027ve lost him again!\" It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn\u0027t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn\u0027t help shutting \u0027em, to ease \u0027em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, \"Here he is!\" Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday\u0027s one, the man\u0027s lost again! This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What did Jem Spyers say?\u0027 inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story. \\n\\n \u0027Jem Spyers,\u0027 resumed the officer, \u0027for a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says \"Chickweed, I\u0027ve found out who done this here robbery.\" \"Have you?\" said Chickweed. \"Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!\" \"Come!\" said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, \"none of that gammon! You did it yourself.\" So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn\u0027t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!\u0027 said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together. \\n\\n \u0027Very curious, indeed,\u0027 observed the doctor. \u0027Now, if you please, you can walk upstairs.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027If _you_ please, sir,\u0027 returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\u0027s bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle. \\n\\n Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward--in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing. \\n\\n \u0027This,\u0027 said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, \u0027this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d\u0027 ye-call-him\u0027s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\u0027 \\n\\n Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity. \\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t mean to deny that, I suppose?\u0027 said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again. \\n\\n \u0027It was all done for the--for the best, sir,\u0027 answered Giles. \u0027I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\u0027t have meddled with him. I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Thought it was what boy?\u0027 inquired the senior officer. \\n\\n \u0027The housebreaker\u0027s boy, sir!\u0027 replied Giles. \u0027They--they certainly had a boy.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well? Do you think so now?\u0027 inquired Blathers. \\n\\n \u0027Think what, now?\u0027 replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner. \\n\\n \u0027Think it\u0027s the same boy, Stupid-head?\u0027 rejoined Blathers, impatiently. \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know; I really don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Giles, with a rueful countenance. \u0027I couldn\u0027t swear to him.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What do you think?\u0027 asked Mr. Blathers. \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what to think,\u0027 replied poor Giles. \u0027I don\u0027t think it is the boy; indeed, I\u0027m almost certain that it isn\u0027t. You know it can\u0027t be.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Has this man been a-drinking, sir?\u0027 inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor. \\n\\n \u0027What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!\u0027 said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt. \\n\\n Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient\u0027s pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them. \\n\\n Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn\u0027t know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty. \\n\\n Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning. \\n\\n With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\u0027s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went. \\n\\n In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver\u0027s appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed. \\n\\n Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness. \\n\\n “开门，”外边有人回答道，“我们是波雾街的警官，今天接到你们报警。”\\n\\n 听到这番话，布里特尔斯感到放心多了，他把门大打开来，迎面出现了一个身穿大衣的胖子，那人二话没说明上帝的万能及与现实世界的联系，认为人的灵魂“皆禀皇，在擦垫上把鞋揩干净，神色从容地走了进来，像是到了自己家里一样。\\n\\n “派个人出去把我的伙计换下来，听见了吗，年轻人？”警官吩咐道，“他正在车那里伺候马儿。你们这里有没有车房，把车赶进去停个五分十分钟？”\\n\\n 布里特尔斯作了肯定的答复，指了指房子外边，胖子返身回到花园门口，帮着同伴把马车赶进来，布里特尔斯显出十分钦佩的样子，在一边替他们照亮。他们把车安顿好，便回到屋子里，接着又被让进一间客厅。两位探员脱去大衣，摘下帽子，这才现出本相。\\n\\n 敲门的这位中等身材，体格强壮，年纪在五十岁上下，乌黑发亮的头发剪得很短，蓄了半截连鬓胡子《马克思恩格斯全集》第37、39卷。这些书信针对资产阶级，圆滚滚的脸，一双眼睛十分机警。另一位满头红发，长得瘦骨嶙峋，穿着长统靴，长相实在令人不敢恭维；一尊朝天鼻子看起来很阴险。\\n\\n “告诉你们当家的，布拉瑟斯和达福来了，听见了吗？”比较健壮的那位抹了抹头发，把一副手铐放在桌子上。“噢。晚上好，先生。我能不能私下跟你谈两句，如果你愿意的话？”\\n\\n 话是冲着刚刚露面的罗斯伯力先生说的。这位绅士打了个手势，要布里特尔斯退下去，自己领着两位女士走进来，把门关上了。\\n\\n “这位就是本宅的女主人。”罗斯伯力先生指着梅莱太太说道。\\n\\n 布拉瑟斯先生鞠了一躬。主人请他坐下，他便把帽子放在地板上，自己在椅子上坐下，并示意达福照此办理。后一位绅士似乎不太熟悉上流社会的规矩，要不就是在这种场合感到过于不自在――二者必居其――他四肢的肌肉接二连三地抽动了一阵，刚刚坐下来，又手忙脚乱地把手杖头塞进嘴里。\\n\\n “嗯，有关此地的这一次抢劫，先生，”布拉瑟斯说道，“详细情形如何？”\\n\\n 罗斯伯力先生显然很想赢得时间，他把事情经过讲得非常详细，还加上了大量的废话，布拉瑟斯先生和达福先生则显得胸有成竹，时不时地相互点点头。\\n\\n “当然，在我把事情查清楚之前，我也说不出个究竟，”布拉瑟斯说，“不过，眼下我的看法是――我可以把话说到这一步――这不是乡巴佬干的，唔，达福？”\\n\\n “当然不是。”达福答道。\\n\\n “现在，为两位女士着想，我说明一下乡巴佬这个词，我理解你的意思是说，这一次袭击绝非乡下人所为，对吗？”罗斯伯力带着一丝笑意说道。\\n\\n “是那么回事，先生，”布拉瑟斯回答，“关于打劫的情况就是这些了，是不是？”\\n\\n “就这些了。”大夫答道。\\n\\n “嗯，用人们都在议论，说这里有个孩子，这是怎么回事？”布拉瑟斯说。\\n\\n “根本没有的事。”大夫回答，“纯粹是有个吓破了胆的仆人想入非非，以为他也参与了这次未遂的入室抢劫，胡扯，纯属无稽之谈。”\\n\\n “真要是这样，那好办。”达福加了一句。\\n\\n “他说的完全正确，”布拉瑟斯赞许地点了点头，一边漫不经心地摆弄着手铐，仿佛拿的是一对响板似的。“那孩子叫什么名字？他对自己的情况说了些什么？他从哪儿来？该不是从天上掉下来的吧，先生？”\\n\\n “当然不是，”大夫神经质地朝两位女士看了一眼，回答说。“我知道他的整个经历，回头我们还可以谈谈。我想，你们一定乐意先去看看窃贼下手的地方吧？”\\n\\n “那还用说，”布拉瑟斯先生应声说道，“我们最好先勘查现场，然后再审查仆人。这是办案的老规矩。”\\n\\n 他们当下便把灯火置备停当，布拉瑟斯先生和达福先生在那位当地警察、布里特尔斯、凯尔司以及所有其余的人陪同下，来到走廊尽头的那间小屋，从窗口往外看了看，接着到草地上走了一遭，从那扇窗户上往里边瞧了瞧。在这之后，又举起一支蜡烛检查窗板，随后用提灯察看足迹，还用一柄草叉在灌木丛中捅了一阵。事情办完，全体观众屏息静气，看着他们回到了别墅里。凯尔司先生和布里特尔斯奉命再次扮演他们在前一天夜里的惊险故事中的角色，他们至少演了六七遍。第一遍时自相矛盾的重大情节仅有一处，最后一遍也不过十来处。取得这样的结果之后，布拉瑟斯和达福走出去，进行了长时间的磋商，与此相比，就保密程度和严肃程度而言，许多名医对最复杂的病情进行的会诊都只能算是儿戏罢了。\\n\\n 与此同时，大夫在隔壁房间里焦躁难耐地走来走去，梅莱太太和露丝望着他，神色都很焦急。\\n\\n “真伤脑筋，”在快步兜了无数个圈子之后，他停了下来，说道，“我简直束手无策。”\\n\\n “可不是，”露丝说，“要是把这苦孩子的事源源本本讲给这些人听，总该使他获得免罪的。”\\n\\n “我表示怀疑，亲爱的小姐，”大夫摇了摇头，“我并不认为他会获得赦免，不管是告诉他们还是告诉高一级的法官。一句话，他们会说，他是干什么的？一个离家出走的孩子。单单从世俗的理由和可能性来判断，他的故事就非常可疑。”\\n\\n “你相信不相信，说真的？”露丝没让他再往下说。\\n\\n “我相信，尽管这个故事很离奇，或许我这样做整个是一个老傻瓜。”大夫回答，“不管怎么说吧，把这样一个故事讲给一位老练的警察听，恐怕不大合适。”\\n\\n “为什么不呢？”露丝问道。\\n\\n “因为，我可爱的法官，”大夫回答道，“因为按照他们的眼光来衡量，这事有许多见不得人的地方。那孩子能够证明的仅仅是那些看上去对他不利的部分，而无法证明那些有利的方面。这帮混账东西，他们会追问这是什么原因，那是什么理由，什么都不相信。根据他自己的说法，你瞧，他过去一段时间跟一帮小偷混在一起，因涉嫌扒窃一位绅士的钱包进了警察局。随后又被人强行拐跑了，从那位绅士家里带到一个他既不能说出点什么，又指不出东南西北的地方，他对那儿的情形连最最模糊的印象都没有。那些人似乎把他当成宝贝，带到杰茨来，不管他愿不愿意，把他从窗口塞进去，计划打劫一户人家。接下来，恰好就在他正想叫醒房子里的人，正要做这一件可以洗清他的一切罪名的事情，一个混账领班莽里奔撞地半路杀出来，还开枪打伤了他。就好像存心不让他替自己积点德似的。这一切你还不明白？”\\n\\n “我当然明白，”露丝看着大夫心急火燎的样子不禁微笑起来。“不过，我还是看不出其中有什么可以给那可怜的孩子定罪。”\\n\\n “是啊，”大夫答道，“当然没有。愿上帝保佑你们女人的慧眼。你们的眼睛，对任何问题都只看一个方面，无论是好是坏，就是说，总是盯住最先出现在眼前的东西。”\\n\\n 大夫发表了这一番经验之谈，双手插进衣袋，又开始在屋子里踱来踱去，速度比先前还要快。\\n\\n “我越琢磨这件事，”大夫说道，“越觉得，假如我们把这孩子的真实经历向这些人和盘托出的话，必定后患无穷。我敢肯定谁也不会相信。即便最后他们不可能把他怎么样，只是一味地拖下去，并且把一切可能产生的疑点张扬出去，你们要拯救他脱离苦海的慈善计划还是会遇到极大的障碍。”\\n\\n “噢。那怎么办？”露丝大叫起来，“天啦，天啦！他们把这些人请来干什么？”\\n\\n “是啊，请来干什么！”梅莱太太高声说道，“说穿了，我巴不得他们别上这儿来。”\\n\\n “在我看来，’罗斯伯力先生平静地坐了下来，看样子打算豁出去了，“我们只能厚着脸皮试一下，坚持到底。我们的目的是高尚的，我们这样做也就情有可原，那孩子身上有发烧的明显症状，不宜过多交谈，这是一大福音。我们必须充分加以利用，要是利用了还是解决不了问题，我们也算尽了心了。进来。”\\n\\n “好的，先生，”布拉瑟斯走进房间，身后跟着他的那位同事，他顾不上多说，先把门紧紧关上。“这不是一起预谋性事件。”\\n\\n “什么鬼预谋性事件？”大夫很不耐烦。\\n\\n “女士们，”布拉瑟斯转向两位女士，好像十分同情她们的孤陋寡闻，对大夫的无知则只能表示轻蔑，“我们把有用人参与其中的叫作预谋抢劫。”\\n\\n “这个案子，谁也没有怀疑他们。”梅莱大太说。\\n\\n “很可能是这样，夫人，”布拉瑟斯回答，“正因为这样，他们反而可能参加了。”\\n\\n “从陈述来看就更可能了。”达福说道。\\n\\n “我们发现这是伦敦人干的，”布拉瑟斯继续报告，“因为手段是一流的。”\\n\\n “的确非常漂亮。”达福小声地评论道。\\n\\n “这事有两个人参加，”布拉瑟斯接着说道，“他们还带着一个小孩，看看窗户的尺寸就明白了。目前可以奉告的就是这些了。我们眼下就去看看你们安顿在楼上的这个孩子，如果可以的话。”\\n\\n “也许他们还是先喝点什么，梅莱太太？”大夫容光焕发，好像已经有了新的主意。\\n\\n “噢！真是的！”露丝急切地叫了起来，“只要二位愿意，马上就可以办到。”\\n\\n “呃，小姐，谢谢。”布拉瑟斯撩起衣袖抹了抹嘴，说道。“干这一行就是让人口干。随便来点什么，小姐。别太让您受累。”\\n\\n “来点什么好呢？”大夫一边问，一边跟着年轻小姐向食橱走去。\\n\\n “一点点酒，先生，如果终归要喝的话，”布拉瑟斯回答，“此次从伦敦来可真冷得够呛，夫人，我一直就觉得酒很能使人心情变得暖和起来。”\\n\\n 这一番饶有趣味的见解是说给梅莱太太听的，她非常谦和地听着。就在讲这番话的当儿，大夫溜出了房间。\\n\\n “啊！”布拉瑟斯先生说，他不是端住酒杯的高脚，而是用左手的拇指和食指抓住杯子底部，靠在自己的胸前。“女士们，我干这一行，见过的事可多了。”\\n\\n “布拉瑟斯，在埃德蒙顿附近小巷里的那起打劫就是啊。”达福先生努力帮助同事回忆。\\n\\n “跟这一回有点像，不是吗？”布拉瑟斯先生应声说道，“那一回是大烟囱契科韦德干的，是他干的。”\\n\\n “你老是算到他头上，”达福回答，“那是高手佩特干的，我告诉你吧，大烟囱和我一样，跟这事没一点关系。”\\n\\n “滚你的！”布拉瑟斯先生骂道，“你懂什么。你还记得那一回大烟囱的钱给人抢走的事情吗？可真是惊人啊。比我看过的哪一本小说书都精彩。”\\n\\n “怎么回事？”露丝迫不及待地问，只要这两位不受欢迎的客人露出心情愉快的任何迹象，她都会加以鼓励。\\n\\n “那是一次抢劫，小姐，几乎没有人搞得清楚，”布拉瑟斯说道，“有一个叫大烟囱契科韦德的――”\\n\\n “大烟囱就是大鼻子的意思，小姐。”达福插嘴说。\\n\\n “小姐当然知道，不是吗？”布拉瑟斯质问道，“你干吗老是打岔，伙计。有个叫大烟囱契科韦德的，小姐，在决战桥那边开了一家酒馆。他有一间地下室，好些个年纪轻轻的公子哥儿都喜欢上那儿去，看看斗鸡、捕獾什么的。我见得多了，安排这些消遣得花不少脑筋。当时，他还没加入哪个堂口。一天夜里，他放在一只帆布袋子里的三百二十七畿尼被人抢了，深更半夜被一个蒙着黑眼罩的高个子从他卧室里偷走了，那个人藏在他床底下，得手之后就腾地一下跳出了窗口，窗口只有一层楼高。他那一手非常利落，不过大烟囱也挺利落，他听到响声醒了，跳下床来，用大口径短枪照他就是一枪，惊动了邻居。他们当下就嚷起有喊来啦，到各处看了看，发现大烟囱打中了那个强盗，一路上都是血迹，直到老远老远的一道篱笆，到那儿就看不到了。不管怎么说，他已经带着现钞跑掉了。结果，执证酒商契科韦德先生的大名，跟别的破产者一块儿出现在公报上边了，五花八门的救济啊，年金啊，我也不清楚到底有多少，都替这可怜人办好了。他这次丢了钱，情绪非常消沉，在街上转悠了三四天，拼命扯自个儿的头发，好些人都害怕他会去寻短见。有一天，他慌慌张张跑到局里来了，和治安推事关起门来谈了好一阵，之后，治安推事摇摇铃，把杰姆。斯拜士叫进去了（杰姆是一个干练的警官），吩咐他协助契科韦德先生捉拿打劫他家的那个人。‘我看见他了，斯拜土，’契科韦德说，‘他昨天上午从我家门前走过。’‘那你干吗不上去逮住他？’斯拜士说。‘我吓成了一摊泥，你用一根牙签也能把我脑袋打得稀烂，’那可怜的家伙说，‘可咱们准能抓住他。因为晚上十点到十一点之间，他又走过去了。’斯拜士一听这话，往衣袋里放了张干净的亚麻布和一把梳子，就走了，说不定他得呆上一天两天呢。他藏在那家酒馆一块小小的红窗帘后边，连帽子都没脱，只要打声招呼，马上就可以冲上去。夜深了，他正在那儿吸他的烟斗，突然之间契科韦德吼起来了：‘在这儿呢！抓贼啊！杀人啦！’杰姆斯拜士冲出去，看见契科韦德一路喊叫，顺着那条街没命地跑。斯拜士也追了上去。契科韦德一直跑，人们围上去，人人都在吆喝‘抓贼啊！’契科韦德自个儿一个劲地喊，像疯了一样。斯拜士刚转过一个街角，却看不见他人影了，赶紧转过去吧，看见那儿有一堆人，就一头扎了进去：‘哪一个是贼？’‘我他妈的。’契科韦德说，‘我又让他给跑了。’这事还真怪，可哪儿也看不见人，他们就回酒馆去了。第二天早上，斯拜土来到老地方，从窗帘后边往外瞧，就为了找一个蒙着黑眼罩的高个子男人，他自个儿连眼睛都看疼了。到后来，他只好合上眼睛，好放松一会儿。就在那一瞬间，他听到契科韦德大叫起来：‘他在这儿呢！’他又一次冲上去，契科韦德已经跑出半条街去了，跑了昨天的两倍那么远，那人又不见了。就这么又折腾了一两回，有一半的邻居认为，打劫契科韦德先生的是魔鬼，魔鬼后来又一直逗他玩来着，另一半邻居说，可怜的契科韦德先生因为伤心已经发疯了。”\\n\\n “杰姆斯拜士怎么说呢？”大夫问道，故事刚开始讲，他就回房间里来了。\\n\\n “杰姆斯拜士，”警官继续说道，“很长一段时间他什么都不谈，留心听着所有的动静，只是别人看不出来，这证明他对自己的本行很精通。但是，有一天早上，他走进酒吧，掏出他的鼻烟盒说：‘契科韦德，我查出这次抢钱的人了。’‘是吗，’契科韦德说，‘呃，我亲爱的斯拜士，只要能让我报仇，就是死了我也心甘情愿。噢，我亲爱的斯拜士，那个坏蛋在哪儿？’‘喏，’斯拜上说着，问他来不来一撮鼻烟，‘别来这一套了。这事是你自己干的。’确实是他干的，就是凭这一手，他弄到不少钱。要不是他演戏演过头了，谁也休想查出来，那是另一回事。”布拉瑟斯说着，放下酒杯，一边不住地把手铐弄得了当直响。\\n\\n “太妙了，真的，”大夫直抒己见，“现在，如果你们二位方便的话，可以上楼去了。”\\n\\n “只要你方便，先生。”布拉瑟斯反唇相讥。两位警探寸步不离，跟着罗斯伯力先生上楼，朝奥立弗的卧室走去，凯尔司先生擎着一支蜡烛走在众人前边。\\n\\n 奥立弗一直在打盹儿，但看上去病情还在恶化，热度比刚露面的时候还要高。大夫扶着他在床上支撑起来，坐了分把钟。他注视着两个陌生人，一点也不明白又要发生什么事――说实在的，他似乎连自己是在什么地方，发生了什么事都想不起来了。\\n\\n “这个孩子，”罗斯伯力先生温和而又饱含热情地说道，“这个孩子因为顽皮，闯进这后边的庭院，就是那个叫什么来着的先生家的庭院，偶然之中被弹簧枪打伤了，今天早晨来到这户人家求助，反倒立刻被扣留下来，并遭到那位手举蜡烛的绅士虐待，他还真会异想天开。身为医生，我可以证明，那位绅士已经将孩子的生命置于极度的危险之中。”\\n\\n 听了对凯尔司先生的这一番介绍，布拉瑟斯先生和达福先生目不转睛地盯着凯尔司。莫名其妙的领班呆呆地望着两位警探，随后将目光转向奥立弗，又从奥立弗身上移向罗斯伯力先生，那种惊慌与困惑兼而有之的表情真是可笑极了。\\n\\n “你恐怕并不打算否认这一点吧？”大夫说着，轻轻地把奥立弗重新安顿好。\\n\\n “我全是出于――出于一片好心啊，先生，”凯尔司回答，“我真的以为就是这个孩子，否则我绝不会跟他过不去。我并不是生性不近人情，先生。”\\n\\n “你以为是个什么孩子？”老资格的警探问。\\n\\n “强盗带来的孩子，先生。”凯尔司答道，“他们――他们肯定带着个孩子。”\\n\\n “哦。你现在还这样认为吗？”布拉瑟斯问道。\\n\\n “认为什么，现在？”凯尔司傻乎乎地望着审问者，回答说。\\n\\n “你这个蠢货，认为是同一个孩子，是不是？”布拉瑟斯不耐烦了。\\n\\n “我不知道，我真的不知道，”凯尔司哭丧着脸说，“我没法担保是他。”\\n\\n “那你认为是怎样的呢？”布拉瑟斯问。\\n\\n “我不知道该怎样认为，”可怜的凯尔司答道，“我认为这不是那个孩子，真的，我几乎可以断定根本就不是。您知道，这不可能。”\\n\\n “这人是不是喝了酒啊，先生？”布拉瑟斯转向大夫，问道。“好一个十足的糊涂虫，你呀。”达福极度轻蔑地冲着凯尔司先生说。\\n\\n 在这一番简短谈话过程中，罗斯伯力先生一直在替病人把脉，这时他从床边椅子里站起身来，说如果两位警官对这个问题还有什么疑惑的话，不妨到隔壁房间去，把布里特尔斯叫来问一问。\\n\\n 他们采纳了这一提议，走进隔壁房间，布里特尔斯先生被叫了进来，他本人和他所尊敬的上司从而落入了这样一个奇异的迷宫，不断生出种种矛盾的说法和不可能发生的事情，除了证明他自己头脑极度发昏，什么事情都无法证明。一点不假，他声称即便当下就把那个真正的小偷叫到面前，他也认不出来。他只不过是把奥立弗当成是他了，一则因为凯尔司先生说就是他，二则此前五分钟，凯尔司先生在厨房里承认，他开始感到非常担心，自己恐怕是太莽撞了点。\\n\\n 在诸多想人非非的臆测中，有人提出这样一个问题，凯尔司先生是否果真打中了什么人，经过查验与他昨天晚上打了一枪的那把配对的另一支手枪的结果，发现除去火药和牛皮纸填弹塞以外，并未装上杀伤力更强的东西，这一发现给大家留下了相当深刻的印象。只有大夫不在此列，因为是他大约十分钟以前刚把弹丸拔下来的。话虽这样说，给凯尔司先生留下的印象却是谁也比不上的。由于担心自己给一位同胞造成了致命伤的缘故，他已经苦恼了几个小时，他急不可待地抓住这一个新的想法，简直如获至宝。最后，两位警官没有在奥立弗身上动过多的脑筋，他们留下那位杰茨警察，自己到镇上住一晚，约定第二天上午再来。\\n\\n 翌日清晨，传来一个消息，说昨天晚上有两个男的和一个小孩因行迹可疑而被捕，关进了金斯顿的监狱。布拉瑟斯和达福两位绅士为此去了一趟金斯顿。据查，所谓形迹可疑归结起来不过是这样一桩事实，有人发现他们在一个干草堆底下睡觉――这虽然是一大罪状，却只该受到监禁的处罚，根据英国法律慈悲为怀的观点及其对王国全体臣民的博爱精神，在缺乏其他的一应证据之时，这一事实尚不足以证明这名睡觉的人或多名睡觉的人，犯有凭借暴力夜间打劫的罪行，理应处以死刑。布拉瑟斯和达福这两位绅士只得空手而归。\\n\\n 简而言之，经过若干进一步的调查，费了许多口舌，治安推事才欣然同意梅莱太太和罗斯伯力先生联名保释奥立弗，但必须随传随到。布拉瑟斯和达福拿到两畿尼的酬金，回伦敦去了，但他们二位对这次远行的目的却有不同的见解。后一位绅士纵观全局，考虑再三，倾向于相信这一次未遂夜间行窃系高手佩特所为。而前一位在同等程度上倾向于把这一功绩整个算在了不起的大烟囱契科韦德先生头上。\\n\\n 此时，在梅莱太太、露丝和心地善良的罗斯伯力先生齐心照料下，奥立弗的身体日趋康复。如果说发自内心，洋溢着感恩之情的热切祈祷能够上达天听――否则还成其为什么祈祷――那么，这个孤儿为他们祈求的祝福已化作宁静与欢乐，渗入了他们的心灵。\\n\\n \\n\\n
