{"id":22356,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance. Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion. The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God\u0027s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers. She was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness. She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her. \u0027And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\u0027 asked the old lady, after a pause. \u0027An hour and twelve minutes, ma\u0027am,\u0027 replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon. \u0027He is always slow,\u0027 remarked the old lady. \u0027Brittles always was a slow boy, ma\u0027am,\u0027 replied the attendant. And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one. \u0027He gets worse instead of better, I think,\u0027 said the elder lady. \u0027It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,\u0027 said the young lady, smiling. Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together. \u0027I never heard of such a thing!\u0027 exclaimed the fat gentleman. \u0027My dear Mrs. Maylie--bless my soul--in the silence of the night, too--I _never_ heard of such a thing!\u0027 With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves. \u0027You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\u0027 said the fat gentleman. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I\u0027m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!\u0027 The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous. \u0027And you, Miss Rose,\u0027 said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \u0027I--\u0027 \u0027Oh! very much so, indeed,\u0027 said Rose, interrupting him; \u0027but there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\u0027 \u0027Ah! to be sure,\u0027 replied the doctor, \u0027so there is. That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.\u0027 Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour. \u0027Honour, eh?\u0027 said the doctor; \u0027well, I don\u0027t know; perhaps it\u0027s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\u0027ve fought a duel, Giles.\u0027 Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party. \u0027Gad, that\u0027s true!\u0027 said the doctor. \u0027Where is he? Show me the way. I\u0027ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That\u0027s the little window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn\u0027t have believed it!\u0027 Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as \u0027the doctor,\u0027 had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive. The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully. \u0027This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,\u0027 said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut. \u0027He is not in danger, I hope?\u0027 said the old lady. \u0027Why, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,\u0027 replied the doctor; \u0027though I don\u0027t think he is. Have you seen the thief?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 rejoined the old lady. \u0027Nor heard anything about him?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027I beg your pardon, ma\u0027am, interposed Mr. Giles; \u0027but I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\u0027 The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage. \u0027Rose wished to see the man,\u0027 said Mrs. Maylie, \u0027but I wouldn\u0027t hear of it.\u0027 \u0027Humph!\u0027 rejoined the doctor. \u0027There is nothing very alarming in his appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\u0027 \u0027If it be necessary,\u0027 replied the old lady, \u0027certainly not.\u0027 \u0027Then I think it is necessary,\u0027 said the doctor; \u0027at all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me--Miss Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!\u0027 两位女士当中有一位年事已高。然而她腰板挺直，与她坐的那把高背橡木椅子可有一比。她穿着极为考究严谨，旧式服装上奇妙地揉进了对时尚品味的一些细小让步，非但无损于格调，反而突出了老派风格的效果。她神色庄重，双手交叉着搭在面前的桌子上，一双丝毫也没有因为岁月流逝而变得暗淡的眼睛全神贯注地凝视着同桌的年轻小姐。 这位小姐光彩照人，正当妙龄，如果真有天使秉承上帝的美好意愿下凡投胎，我们可以无须担心亵渎神灵地猜想，她们也会像她那样青春美妙。 她不到十七岁，可以说天生丽质，模样娴静文雅，纯洁妩媚，尘世似乎本不是她的栖身之地，几间的俗物也不是她的同类。聪慧在她那双深邃的蓝眼睛里闪耀，展现在她高贵的额头上，这种聪慧就她这个年龄或者说在这个世界上似乎颇为罕见。然而，那仪态万方的温柔贤淑，那照亮整个面庞，没有留下丝毫阴影的千道光辉，特别是她的微笑，那种欢乐幸福的微笑――这一切都是为了营造家庭、炉边的安谧和幸福。 她匆忙地料理着餐桌上的琐事，偶尔抬起眼睛，发现老太太国不转睛地瞅着自己，便顽皮地把简简单单编了一下的头发从额前往后一撩，嫣然绽开笑脸，流露出温情和纯真的爱心，连神灵看着她也会眉开眼笑。 “布里特尔斯已经动身一个多小时了，是吗？”老太太踌躇了一下问道。 “一小时十二分，夫人。”凯尔司先生拉住一根黑色丝带，掏出一块银壳怀表看了看，答道。 “他总是慢吞吞的。”老太太说道。 “布里特尔斯向来就是个迟钝的孩子，夫人。”管家回答。顺便提一句，由于布里特尔斯年逾三十还是一个迟钝的小伙子，那就根本不存在变得利索起来的可能性。 “我看他不是变得利索了，倒是越变越慢了。”老太太说。 “假如他停下来跟别的孩子玩的话，那才真是没法说清呢。”小姐微笑着说。 凯尔司先生显然正考虑，自己彬彬有礼地笑一笑是否得体，这时，一辆双轮马车驶抵花园门，车上跳出一位胖胖的绅士，一径朝门口奔来，经过某种不可思议的方式很快走进这所屋子，闯进房间，差一点把凯尔司先生和早餐饭桌一块儿撞翻在地。 “我从来没听说过这种事！”胖绅士大声疾呼，“我亲爱的梅莱太太――上帝保佑――又是在夜静更深的时候――我从来没听说过这种事！” 胖绅士一边倾吐着这些安慰话，一边与两位女士握手，他拖过一把椅子，问她们感觉如何。 “您会没命的，肯定会吓死，”胖绅士说道，“您干吗不派个人来？上帝保佑，我的人只要一分钟就可以赶到，我也一样。在这种情形之下，我敢保证，我的助手一定乐意帮忙。天啦，天啦，真是没有想到。又是在夜静更深的时候。” 大夫看来感到痛心疾首，抢劫案出人意外，又是夜间作案，就好像以人室行劫为业的绅士们的惯例是白天办公，还会提前一两天来个预约似的。 “还有你，露丝小姐，”大夫说着朝年轻小姐转过身去，“我想――” “哦。太出乎意料了，真的，”露丝打断了他的话，“不过楼上有一个可怜的家伙，姑妈希望你去看看。” “啊。真是的，”大夫回答，“我差点忘了，据我所知，那是你干的，凯尔司。” 凯尔司先生正在紧张地把茶杯重新摆好，他涨红了脸说，自己有过这份荣幸。 “荣幸，哦？”大夫说，“好啊，我倒是不明白，也许在一间后厨房里打中一个碱，就和在十二步以外向你的对手开火一样体面呢。你想想，他向空中开了一枪，而你倒像是参加一场决斗，凯尔司。” 凯尔司先生认为，对事情这样轻描淡写实属动机不良，有损自己的荣誉，他彬彬有礼地回答，像自己这样的人不便妄加评判，不过他倒是认为对方不是在开玩笑。 “老天爷有眼。”大夫说道，“他在哪儿？领我去吧。我下来的时候，再替梅莱太太检查一下。他就是从那扇小窗子钻进来的，哦？唉，我简直难以相信。” 他一路唠唠叨叨，跟着凯尔司先生上楼去了。在他往楼上走的这段时间里，写书人要向读者交待一下，罗斯伯力先生是附近的一位外科医生，方圆十英里之内大名鼎鼎的“大夫”，他已经有些发福，这与其归功于生活优裕，不如说是由于他乐天知命。他善良，热心，加上又是一位脾气古怪的老单身汉，当今无论哪一位探险家非得在比此地大五倍的地方才有可能发掘出这么一个。 大夫在楼上呆了很长时间，大大超出了他本人或两位女士的预想。人们从马车里取出一只又大又扁的箱子送上楼去，卧室的铃子频频拉响，仆人们川流不息跑上跑下。根据这些迹象完全可以断定，楼上正在进行某种重要的事情。最后，他总算从楼上下来了。在答复有关病人的焦急不安的询问时，他样子十分神秘，还小心翼翼地关上了门。 “这事非常离奇，梅莱太太。”大夫说话时背朝房门站着，好像是防止有人开门进来似的。 “他已经脱离危险了吧，我希望？”老太太问道。 “嗨，在当前情形下，这算不上离奇的事儿，”大夫回答，“尽管我认为他尚未脱离危险。你们见过这个小偷吗？” “没见过。”老太太回答。 “也没听说过关于他的什么事？” “没有。” “请原谅，夫人，”凯尔司先生插了进来，“罗斯伯力大夫来的时候，我正想告诉您。” 事情是这样的，凯尔司先生一开始没有勇气承认自己打中的仅仅是个孩子。他的勇武刚毅赢得了这么多的赞美，就是豁出性命，他也得推迟几分钟再作解释，在这宝贵的几分钟里，他临危不惧的短促英名正处在风光无限的巅峰之上。 “露丝想看看那个人，”梅莱太太说，“我就是没答应。” “哼。”大夫回答，“他脸上倒是没什么惊人之处。我陪你们去看看他，你们不反对吧？” “如果必要的话，”老太太答道，“当然不反对。” “那我认为有必要，”大夫说，“总而言之，我完全可以担保，您将来会因为迟迟不去看他而深感后悔。他现在非常平静，舒适。请允许我――露丝小姐，可以吗？一点儿也不必害怕，我用信誉担保。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/97/5085.html","bookId":474,"book":{"id":474,"title":"Oliver Twist雾都孤儿","description":"简介： 《雾都孤儿》是英国作家狄更斯于1838年出版的写实小说。以雾都伦敦为背景，讲述了一个孤儿悲惨的身世及遭遇，主人公奥立弗在孤儿院长大，经历学徒生涯，艰苦逃难，误入贼窝，又被迫与狠毒的凶徒为伍，历尽无数辛酸，最后在善良人的帮助下，查明身世并获得了幸福。如同狄...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12898724529f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/97","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
