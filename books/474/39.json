The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\u0027s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration. The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\u0027s growth. The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention. Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber\u0027s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes\u0027s question. \u0027Not long gone seven,\u0027 said the girl. \u0027How do you feel to-night, Bill?\u0027 \u0027As weak as water,\u0027 replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs. \u0027Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.\u0027 Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes\u0027s temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her. \u0027Whining are you?\u0027 said Sikes. \u0027Come! Don\u0027t stand snivelling there. If you can\u0027t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D\u0027ye hear me?\u0027 \u0027I hear you,\u0027 replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh. \u0027What fancy have you got in your head now?\u0027 \u0027Oh! you\u0027ve thought better of it, have you?\u0027 growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye. \u0027All the better for you, you have.\u0027 \u0027Why, you don\u0027t mean to say, you\u0027d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,\u0027 said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder. \u0027No!\u0027 cried Mr. Sikes. \u0027Why not?\u0027 \u0027Such a number of nights,\u0027 said the girl, with a touch of woman\u0027s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: \u0027such a number of nights as I\u0027ve been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I\u0027ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\u0027t have served me as you did just now, if you\u0027d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Well, then,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Sikes, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t. Why, damme, now, the girls\u0027s whining again!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s nothing,\u0027 said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. \u0027Don\u0027t you seem to mind me. It\u0027ll soon be over.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027ll be over?\u0027 demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. \u0027What foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don\u0027t come over me with your woman\u0027s nonsense.\u0027 At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy\u0027s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance. \u0027What\u0027s the matter here, my dear?\u0027 said Fagin, looking in. \u0027Lend a hand to the girl, can\u0027t you?\u0027 replied Sikes impatiently. \u0027Don\u0027t stand chattering and grinning at me!\u0027 With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\u0027s assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient\u0027s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes. \u0027Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\u0027 said Mr. Dawkins; \u0027and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.\u0027 These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance. \u0027Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?\u0027 he asked Fagin. \u0027No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I\u0027ve brought something good with me, that you\u0027ll be glad to see. Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.\u0027 In compliance with Mr. Fagin\u0027s request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence. \u0027Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\u0027 exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; \u0027sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\u0027s no occasion to pick \u0027em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\u0027ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn\u0027t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,--oh no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo\u0027ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!\u0027 Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment\u0027s hesitation. \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. \u0027You\u0027ll do, Bill; you\u0027ll do now.\u0027 \u0027Do!\u0027 exclaimed Mr. Sikes; \u0027I might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you\u0027d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?\u0027 \u0027Only hear him, boys!\u0027 said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u0027And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.\u0027 \u0027The things is well enough in their way,\u0027 observed Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as he glanced over the table; \u0027but what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that \u0027ere dog.--Drive him down, Charley!\u0027 \u0027I never see such a jolly dog as that,\u0027 cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired. \u0027Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He\u0027d make his fortun\u0027 on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.\u0027 \u0027Hold your din,\u0027 cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily. \u0027What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?\u0027 \u0027I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\u0027 replied the Jew. \u0027And what about the other fortnight?\u0027 demanded Sikes. \u0027What about the other fortnight that you\u0027ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?\u0027 \u0027I couldn\u0027t help it, Bill. I can\u0027t go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn\u0027t help it, upon my honour.\u0027 \u0027Upon your what?\u0027 growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. \u0027Here! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it\u0027ll choke me dead.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be out of temper, my dear,\u0027 urged Fagin, submissively. \u0027I have never forgot you, Bill; never once.\u0027 \u0027No! I\u0027ll pound it that you han\u0027t,\u0027 replied Sikes, with a bitter grin. \u0027You\u0027ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn\u0027t been for the girl, I might have died.\u0027 \u0027There now, Bill,\u0027 remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. \u0027If it hadn\u0027t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?\u0027 \u0027He says true enough there!\u0027 said Nancy, coming hastily forward. \u0027Let him be; let him be.\u0027 Nancy\u0027s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make. \u0027It\u0027s all very well,\u0027 said Mr. Sikes; \u0027but I must have some blunt from you to-night.\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t a piece of coin about me,\u0027 replied the Jew. \u0027Then you\u0027ve got lots at home,\u0027 retorted Sikes; \u0027and I must have some from there.\u0027 \u0027Lots!\u0027 cried Fagin, holding up is hands. \u0027I haven\u0027t so much as would--\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know how much you\u0027ve got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\u0027 said Sikes; \u0027but I must have some to-night; and that\u0027s flat.\u0027 \u0027Well, well,\u0027 said Fagin, with a sigh, \u0027I\u0027ll send the Artful round presently.\u0027 \u0027You won\u0027t do nothing of the kind,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Sikes. \u0027The Artful\u0027s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I\u0027ll lie down and have a snooze while she\u0027s gone.\u0027 After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn\u0027t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady\u0027s return. In due course, they arrived at Fagin\u0027s abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go. \u0027Has nobody been, Toby?\u0027 asked Fagin. \u0027Not a living leg,\u0027 answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; \u0027it\u0027s been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I\u0027m as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\u0027t had the good natur\u0027 to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I\u0027m blessed if I an\u0027t!\u0027 With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn\u0027t value his losses the snap of his little finger. \u0027Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!\u0027 said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration. \u0027Not a bit of it,\u0027 replied Mr. Chitling. \u0027Am I, Fagin?\u0027 \u0027A very clever fellow, my dear,\u0027 said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils. \u0027And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an\u0027t he, Fagin?\u0027 asked Tom. \u0027No doubt at all of that, my dear.\u0027 \u0027And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\u0027t it, Fagin?\u0027 pursued Tom. \u0027Very much so, indeed, my dear. They\u0027re only jealous, Tom, because he won\u0027t give it to them.\u0027 \u0027Ah!\u0027 cried Tom, triumphantly, \u0027that\u0027s where it is! He has cleaned me out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\u0027t I, Fagin?\u0027 \u0027To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don\u0027t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It\u0027s time you were on the lay. Come! It\u0027s near ten, and nothing done yet.\u0027 In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit. \u0027Now,\u0027 said Fagin, when they had left the room, \u0027I\u0027ll go and get you that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money, for I\u0027ve got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha! ha!--none to lock up. It\u0027s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\u0027m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!\u0027 he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; \u0027who\u0027s that? Listen!\u0027 The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man\u0027s voice reached her ears. The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time. \u0027Bah!\u0027 he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \u0027it\u0027s the man I expected before; he\u0027s coming downstairs. Not a word about the money while he\u0027s here, Nance. He won\u0027t stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.\u0027 Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man\u0027s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her. It was Monks. \u0027Only one of my young people,\u0027 said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger. \u0027Don\u0027t move, Nancy.\u0027 The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person. \u0027Any news?\u0027 inquired Fagin. \u0027Great.\u0027 \u0027And--and--good?\u0027 asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine. \u0027Not bad, any way,\u0027 replied Monks with a smile. \u0027I have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.\u0027 The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room. \u0027Not that infernal hole we were in before,\u0027 she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story. Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above. The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone. \u0027Why, Nance!\u0027 exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, \u0027how pale you are!\u0027 \u0027Pale!\u0027 echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him. \u0027Quite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?\u0027 \u0027Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\u0027t know how long and all,\u0027 replied the girl carelessly. \u0027Come! Let me get back; that\u0027s a dear.\u0027 With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a \u0027good-night.\u0027 When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way. Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears. It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker. If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted. It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions. As that day closed in, the girl\u0027s excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment. Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him. \u0027Why, burn my body!\u0027 said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face. \u0027You look like a corpse come to life again. What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 \u0027Matter!\u0027 replied the girl. \u0027Nothing. What do you look at me so hard for?\u0027 \u0027What foolery is this?\u0027 demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly. \u0027What is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking of?\u0027 \u0027Of many things, Bill,\u0027 replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. \u0027But, Lord! What odds in that?\u0027 The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them. \u0027I tell you wot it is,\u0027 said Sikes; \u0027if you haven\u0027t caught the fever, and got it comin\u0027 on, now, there\u0027s something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. You\u0027re not a-going to--. No, damme! you wouldn\u0027t do that!\u0027 \u0027Do what?\u0027 asked the girl. \u0027There ain\u0027t,\u0027 said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; \u0027there ain\u0027t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I\u0027d have cut her throat three months ago. She\u0027s got the fever coming on; that\u0027s it.\u0027 Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents. \u0027Now,\u0027 said the robber, \u0027come and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I\u0027ll alter it so, that you won\u0027t know it agin when you do want it.\u0027 The girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance. \u0027The laudanum has taken effect at last,\u0027 murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside. \u0027I may be too late, even now.\u0027 She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\u0027s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber\u0027s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house. A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare. \u0027Has it long gone the half-hour?\u0027 asked the girl. \u0027It\u0027ll strike the hour in another quarter,\u0027 said the man: raising his lantern to her face. \u0027And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\u0027 muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street. Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses\u0027 heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like. \u0027The woman is mad!\u0027 said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away. When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone. It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter\u0027s seat was vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs. \u0027Now, young woman!\u0027 said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, \u0027who do you want here?\u0027 \u0027A lady who is stopping in this house,\u0027 answered the girl. \u0027A lady!\u0027 was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. \u0027What lady?\u0027 \u0027Miss Maylie,\u0027 said Nancy. The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, Nancy repeated her request. \u0027What name am I to say?\u0027 asked the waiter. \u0027It\u0027s of no use saying any,\u0027 replied Nancy. \u0027Nor business?\u0027 said the man. \u0027No, nor that neither,\u0027 rejoined the girl. \u0027I must see the lady.\u0027 \u0027Come!\u0027 said the man, pushing her towards the door. \u0027None of this. Take yourself off.\u0027 \u0027I shall be carried out if I go!\u0027 said the girl violently; \u0027and I can make that a job that two of you won\u0027t like to do. Isn\u0027t there anybody here,\u0027 she said, looking round, \u0027that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?\u0027 This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere. \u0027Take it up for her, Joe; can\u0027t you?\u0027 said this person. \u0027What\u0027s the good?\u0027 replied the man. \u0027You don\u0027t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?\u0027 This allusion to Nancy\u0027s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel. \u0027Do what you like with me,\u0027 said the girl, turning to the men again; \u0027but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty\u0027s sake.\u0027 The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery. \u0027What\u0027s it to be?\u0027 said the man, with one foot on the stairs. \u0027That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\u0027 said Nancy; \u0027and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.\u0027 \u0027I say,\u0027 said the man, \u0027you\u0027re coming it strong!\u0027 \u0027You give the message,\u0027 said the girl firmly; \u0027and let me hear the answer.\u0027 The man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs. \u0027It\u0027s no good being proper in this world,\u0027 said the first housemaid. \u0027Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\u0027 said the second. The third contented herself with wondering \u0027what ladies was made of\u0027; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of \u0027Shameful!\u0027 with which the Dianas concluded. Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired. 赛克斯先生提出这个问题时所在的房间不是他杰茨之行以前住过的那些房子当中的一处，虽说也是在伦敦城内的同一个区域，离他从前的住处不远。外表上，这屋子不像他的旧居那样称心，只是一所劣等的公寓即分析怎样从不知到知，从不完全、不确切的知识到比较完，陈设简陋，面积也很有限。光线只能从屋顶一个小小的窗口射进来，屋子旁边是一条狭窄肮脏的胡同。这里并不缺乏表明这位君子近来时运不济的其它征兆，家具严重不足，舒适完全无从谈起，加上连内外换洗衣物这样琐细的动产也都看不见，道出了一种极度窘困的处境。如果这些迹象还有待确定的话，赛克斯先生本人那种瘦弱不堪的身体状况可以提供充分的证明。 这个专以打劫为生的家伙躺在床上，把他那件白色的大衣裹在身上当睡衣，死灰色的病容，加上龌龊的睡帽，一星期没刮的胡子又硬又黑，这一切表明他的整个嘴脸毫无改观。那只狗伏在床边，时而闷闷不乐地看一眼主人，当街上或者楼下有什么响动引起它的注意，它便竖起耳朵，发出一阵低沉的吠叫。靠窗坐着一个女的，正忙着替那个强盗补一件他平时穿的旧背心，她脸色苍白，由于照料病人，加上度日艰难，她变得十分瘦削，要不是听到她口答赛克斯先生问话的嗓声，让人很难认出她就是已经在书中出现过的南希。 “七点刚过一会儿，”姑娘说道，“今天晚上你觉得怎么样，比尔？” “软得跟唾沫一样，”赛克斯先生冲着自己的眼睛和手脚咒骂了一句，回答道。“来，给咱搭把手，让我从这张该死的床上下来。” 赛克斯先生没有因为生病而脾气变得好一些。姑娘将他扶起来，搀着他朝一把椅子走去，他嘟嘟哝哝，不住口地骂她笨手笨脚，还打了她。 “哭鼻子了，是吗？”赛克斯说，“得了吧。别站在那儿抽抽搭搭的。你要是除了擦鼻子抹眼泪以外什么事也干不了，那就干脆滚蛋。听见没有？” “听见了，”姑娘把脸转到一边，硬撑着笑了一声，回答道。“你又在胡思乱想了？” “哦。你想通了，是不是？”赛克斯看见泪水在她眼睛里直打转，又吼了起来。“这样对你有些好处，你想通了。” “嗳，比尔，你今天晚上不是真的想对我这么凶，是吗？”姑娘说着，把一只手搭在他的肩膀上。 “不是？”赛克斯嚷道，“为什么不？” “那么多个夜晚，”姑娘带着一点女姓的温柔说，这样一来，连她的声音也变得悦耳了。“那么多个夜晚，我一直忍着，不跟你发火，照看你，关心你，就好像你还是个孩子，这还是我头一次看着你像这个样子。你要是想到这一点，就不会像刚才那样对待我了，是吗？说呀，说呀，说你不会的。” “得了，就这样吧，”赛克斯先生答应了，“我不会的。唔，他妈的，啧啧，这丫头又在哭鼻子。” “没什么，”姑娘说着倒在一把椅子上，“你不用管我，很快就会过去的。” “什么东西会过去的？”赛克斯先生恶狠狠地问，“你又在干什么蠢事？起来，干你的活去，别拿你那些娘儿们的胡扯来烦我。” 换上任何一个时候，这种训斥，连同发出训斥时的腔调，都会产生预期的效果。可这一次，赛克斯先生还没来得及按照在类似场合的惯例发出几句得体的恶言，来为他的威胁加点佐料，那姑娘已经实在虚弱不堪，筋疲力尽，头搭拉在椅背上，晕过去了。赛克斯先生不太清楚如何应付这种非同小可的紧急情况――因为南希小姐的歇斯底里一旦发作，通常来势迅猛，完全要由病人死打硬撑，旁人帮不上什么忙――他试了一下用咒骂的办法，发现这种处理方式一点效果也没有，只得叫人帮忙。 “这儿怎么啦，我亲爱的？”费金往屋里张望着，说道。 “帮这姑娘一把，你还有完没完？”赛克斯不耐烦地回答，“别站在那儿耍贫嘴，冲着我嘻皮笑脸。” 费金发出一声惊呼，奔上前来对姑娘施行救助，这功夫，约翰达金斯先生（也就是机灵鬼）跟着自己的恩师也已经走进来，他连忙把背在身上的一个包裹放在地板上，从脚跟脚走进来的查理贝兹少爷手里夺过一只瓶子，一转眼已经用牙齿将瓶塞拔出来，先尝了尝瓶子里的东西，以免出错，随后又往病人嗓子眼里倒了一些。 “你用风箱给她扇几口新鲜空气，查理，”达金斯先生吩咐道，“比尔解开衬裙的时候，费金，你就拍她的手。” 这些经过协调的急救措施进行得热火朝天――尤其是在委托给贝兹少爷的那个部门，他像是认为自己在这次行动中的作为是一种史无前例的乐趣――功夫不大便产生了理想的效果。姑娘逐渐恢复了知觉，晃晃悠悠地走到床边的一张椅子跟前，把脸埋在枕头上，让多少有些感到诧异的赛克斯先生去对付那三个不速之客。 “哟，是哪阵邪风把你给刮到这儿来啦？”他问费金。 “压根儿不是邪风，我亲爱的，邪风是不会给谁带来好处的，我带来了一点你看见保准高兴的好东西。机灵鬼，亲爱的，打开包袱，把今天早上我们花光了钱才买来的那一点点小东西交给比尔。” 机灵鬼依照费金先生的嘱咐，解开他带来的那个用旧台布做成的大包裹，把里边的物品一件一件地递给查理贝兹，查理再一件一件放到桌上，一边大肆吹嘘这些东西多么难得，多么美妙。 “多好的兔肉饼，比尔，”这位小绅士要他看看一块很大的馅饼。“多可爱的小兔子，多嫩的腿儿，比尔，那几根骨头入嘴就化，用不着剔出来。半磅绿茶，七先令六便士一磅，浓得不得了，你要是用滚水来泡，准会把茶壶盖也给顶飞了。糖一磅半，有点发潮，肯定是那帮黑鬼一点不卖力，成色是差一点――啊，不！两磅重的皮面包两只，一磅最好的鲜肉，一块双料格罗斯特①干酪，都说过了，还有一样是你喝过的名酒中最名贵的一种。”—— ①英国西南部城市，以出产干酪闻名。 贝兹少爷念完最后一句赞美诗，从他的一个硕大无比的口袋里掏出用塞子塞得很严的一大瓶酒，达金斯先生眨眼之间已经从瓶子里倒出满满一杯纯酒精，那位病号毫不迟疑，一仰脖子喝了下去。 “啊！”老犹太心满意足地搓了搓手，说道，“你顶得住，比尔，你现在顶得住了。” “顶得住！”赛克斯先生大叫起来，“我就是给撂倒二十次，你也不会帮我一把。三个多礼拜了，你这个假仁假义的混蛋，把我一个人丢在这种处境里不管，你是什么意思？” “孩子们，瞧他说的。”老犹太耸了耸肩说，“我们给他带了这么多好――东――西。” “东西倒是不错，”赛克斯先生往桌上扫了一眼，火气略略消了一些，说道。“你自个儿说说，干吗要把我丢在这儿？这些日子我心情坏透了，身子骨也垮了，又没钱花，全齐了，你却一直扔下我不管，简直把我看得连那只狗都不如――赶它下去，查理。” “我还从来没见过这么好玩的狗呢，”贝兹少爷嚷嚷着，照赛克斯先生的要求把狗赶开了。“跟个老太太上菜市场一样，总闻得出吃的东西来。它上台演戏准能发财，这狗还能振兴戏剧呢。” “别吵吵，”赛克斯看见狗已经退回到床底下去了，却还在忿忿不平地嗷嗷叫，就吼了一声。“你还有什么好说的，你这个干瘪瘪的老窝主，嗯？” “我离开伦敦有一个多礼拜了，亲爱的，去办了件事。”老犹太回答。 “还有半个月又怎么说呢？”赛克斯刨根问底，“你把我丢在这地方，跟一只生病的耗子躺在洞里似的，另外那半个月是怎么回事？” “我也是没法子，比尔，”老犹太答道，“当着人面我不便详细解释。可我实在没法子，我拿名誉担保。” “拿你的什么担保？”赛克斯用极其厌恶的口气吼道，“喏。你们哪个小子，替我切一片馅饼下来，去去我嘴里这味，他的话真能咽死我。” “别发脾气了，比尔，”老犹太依头顺脑地劝道，“我绝对没有忘掉你，比尔，一次也没有。” “没有？我量你也没有，”赛克斯带着苦笑回答说，“我躺在这地方，每个钟头又是哆嗦又是发烧，你都在想鬼点子，出馊主意，让比尔干这个，让比尔干那个，只要比尔一好起来，什么都让他去做，再便宜没有了，反正比尔够穷的了，还非得替你干活。要不是这姑娘，我早就没命了。” “比尔，你瞧，”费金赶紧抓住这句话作挡箭牌，“要不是这姑娘。除了苦命的老费金，谁还能帮你弄到这样好使唤的姑娘？” “他说的倒是实话。”南希连忙上前说道，”随他去，随他吧。” 南希一出面，谈话就转了一个方向。两个少年接到处处谨慎的老犹太递过来的一道诡谲的眼色，开始一个劲地向她敬酒，可她喝得很有节制。这功夫，费金强装出一副兴致勃勃的样子，逐渐使赛克斯先生心情好了一些，费金假意把赛克斯先生的恐吓当做是插科打诨，接下来，赛克斯多喝了一些酒，也给了他面子，讲了一两个粗俗的笑话，费金直打哈哈，一副非常开心的样子。 “事情倒是蛮不错，”赛克斯先生说道，“但你今天晚上非得给我弄几个现钱不可。” “我身边一个子儿也没有。”老犹太回答。 “可你家里多的是钱，”赛克斯顶了一句，“我得拿一些那儿的。” “多的是钱！”老犹太扬起双手，大叫起来，“我还没有多到可以――” “我不知道你弄了多少钱，而且我敢说连你自己都不知道，那可是得花很多时间去数的，”赛克斯说，“反正我今天要钱，废话少说。” “行，行，”老犹太叹了口气，说道，“我回头派机灵鬼给你送来。” “这种事你才不会干呢，”赛克斯答道，“机灵鬼机灵过头了点，他不是忘了带，就是走迷了路，要不就是碰上警察来不了了，横竖都有借口，只要有你的吩咐。还是南希到那边窝里去取，一切稳稳当当。她去的功夫，我躺下打个盹。” 经过多次讨价还价，费金将对方要求的贷款数目从五镑压低到了三镑四先令又九便士。他连连赌咒发誓说，那样一来，他就只剩十八个便士来维持家用了。赛克斯先生板着面孔说，要是没有多的钱了，也只好凑合着用了。于是，南希准备陪费金到家里去，机灵鬼和贝兹少爷把那些食物放进橱里。老犹太向自己的贴心伙伴告别，由南希和那两个少年陪着回去了。与此同时，赛克斯先生倒在床上，安心要睡到姑娘回来。 他们平安到达了老犹太的住所，托比格拉基特跟基特宁先生正在那里专心致志地打第十五局克里比奇，几乎用不着说，这一局又是后一位绅士失利，输掉了他的第十五个也是最后的一个六便士银币。他的两位小朋友一看都乐开了。格拉基特先生显然有些不好意思，被人撞见他竟然拿一位地位和智力远远不如自己的绅士寻开心，他打了个呵欠，一边询问赛克斯的情况，一边戴上帽子打算离去。 “没有人来过，托比？”老犹太问道。 “鬼都没有一个，”格拉基先生将衣领往上扯了扯，回答说。“没劲，同喝剩的啤酒一样。你是得弄点什么看得过去的东西酬谢我，费金，我替你看了那么久的家。我他妈的像陪审员一样无聊，要不是我脾气好，有心替这个年轻人解解闷，我已经睡觉去了，睡得和在新门监狱里头一样沉。无聊死了，我要是说瞎话，让我不得好死。” 托比格拉基特先生一边发出这样那样属于同一类型的感慨，一边神气活现地将到手的钱橹到一起，塞进背心口袋里，似乎他这么个大人物根本就没把这样小的银币放在眼里。钱放好了，他大模大样地走出了房间，风度翩翩，仪态高雅，引得基特宁先生朝他穿着长靴的双腿频频投以艳羡的眼光，直到再也看不见了才打住。他向众人担保说，只花了十五个六便士银币结识那样一位有头有脸的人物，他认为一点不贵，他才不把自己的小指头一弹输掉的钱放在心上。 “你可真是个怪人，汤姆。”贝兹少爷让这一番声明逗乐了，说道。 “一点也不怪，”基特宁先生回答，“我是不是很怪，费金？” “你非常机灵，我亲爱的。”老犹太说着，拍拍他的肩膀，朝另外两个徒弟眨了眨眼睛。 “格拉基特先生是一位名流，对不对，费金？”汤姆问。 “这绝无问题，亲爱的。” “而且，跟他结识是件很有面子的事情，对不对，费金？”汤姆追问着。 “可不是嘛，真的，伙计。他们就是爱嫉妒，汤姆，因为他不给他们这个面子。” “啊！”汤姆洋洋得意地叫了起来，“是那么回事。他让我输了个精光。可我高兴的时候，可以去赚更多的，我行不行啊，费金？” “你肯定行，而且去得越早越好，汤姆，你马上把输的钱赚回来，就别耽误了。机灵鬼！查理！你们该去上班了。快走。快十点了，什么事还没干呢。” 遵照这一暗示，两个少年向南希点了点头，戴上帽子，离开了房间。机灵鬼和他那位乐天派伙伴一路上都在寻开心，讲了很多俏皮话，拿基特宁先生当冤大头。平心而论，基特宁先生的举动倒也没有什么特别出格或者说与众不同之处，要知道，都市中有一大帮劲头十足的年轻人，他们为了在上流社会出人头地付出的代价比基特宁先生高得多，也有一大帮正人君子（构成这个上流社会的正是他们），他们创立名气的基础与花花公子托比格拉基特非常相似。 “听着，”等两个徒弟离开房间，老犹太说道，“我去给你拿那些钱，南希。这把钥匙是小食品柜上的，里边放着那几个男孩弄来的一些零碎东西，亲爱的。我的钱从来不上锁，因为我没有弄到什么非得锁上不行，亲爱的。哈哈哈！没什么需要上锁的。这是一份苦差使，南希，而且不讨好，我不过是喜欢看见年轻人围在我身边而已。什么我都得忍着，什么都得忍。嘘！”他慌里慌张地说，一边把钥匙塞进怀里。“那是谁？听！” 姑娘双臂交叉坐在桌旁，像是一点也不感兴趣似的，要么就是根本不在乎有没有人进来出去，管他是谁呢，这时候，一个男子的低语声传到了她的耳朵里。一听到这个声音，她闪电一般敏捷地扯下软帽和技巾，扔到桌子底下。老犹太立刻回过头来，她又低声抱怨起天气炎热来，这种懒洋洋的口吻和刚才那种极为慌乱迅速的举动形成鲜明的反差，不过，费金一点也没有觉察到，他刚才是背朝着南希。 “呸。”老犹太低声说道，像是感到很不凑巧。“我先前约的那个人，他下楼到我们这儿来了。他在这儿的时候，钱的事一个字也没别提，南希。他呆不了多久，要不了十分钟，我亲爱的。” 一个男子的脚步声在外边楼梯上响了起来。老犹太将瘦骨嶙峋的食指在嘴唇上接了一下，端起蜡烛朝门口走去。费金和来客同时到门口，那人匆匆走进房间，已经到了姑娘的面前，却还没有看见她。 来客是孟可司。 “这是我的一个学生，”老犹太见孟可司一看有生人就直往后退，便说道，“南希，你不要走。” 姑娘往桌旁靠了靠，漫不经心地看了益可司一眼，就把目光缩了回去，然而就在来客朝费金转过身去的当儿，她又偷偷看了一眼，这一次的目光是那样敏捷锐利，意味深长，假如有哪位看热闹的注意到了这种变化，几乎可以肯定不会相信这两种目光是发自同一个人。 “有什么消息吗？”费金问。 “重大消息。” “是――是不是好消息？”费金吞吞吐吐地问，似乎害怕会因为过于乐观而触怒对方。 “还算不坏，”孟可司微微一笑，答道，“我这一趟真够麻利的。我跟你说句话。” 姑娘往桌上靠得更紧了，没有提出要离开这间屋子，尽管她看得出孟可司是冲着她说的。老犹太可能有顾虑，如果硬要撵她出去的话，她没准会大声件气地谈到那笔钱的事，就朝楼上指了指，领着孟可司走出房间。 “不要到从前咱们呆过的那个鬼窝子里去。”她听得出那个汉子一边上楼，一边还在说话。老犹太笑起来，回答了一句什么话，她没听清楚，楼板发出嘎嘎的响声，看来他把同伴带到了三楼上。 他俩的脚步声在房子里发出的回响还没有平息下来，南希已经脱掉鞋子，撩起衣据胡乱盖在头上，裹住肩膀，站在门口屏息谛听。响声刚一停下，她便迈开轻柔得令人难以置信的脚步，溜出房间，无声无息地登上楼梯，消失在幽暗的楼上。 屋子里有一刻钟或一刻钟以上空无一人，随后，姑娘依旧像一丝游魂似的飘然而归，紧接着便听见那两个人下来了。孟可司直接出门往街上去了，老犹太为了钱的事又一次慢吞吞地走上楼去。他回来的功夫，姑娘正在整理她的披巾和软帽，像是准备离去。 “嗨，南希，”老犹太放下蜡烛，嚷嚷着往后退去，“你脸色这么苍白。” “苍白？”姑娘应声说道，她将双手罩在额上，像是打算仔细看看他似的。 “太可怕了，你一个人在干什么呢？” “什么也没干，不就是坐在这个闷热的地方，也不知过了多久了，”姑娘轻描淡写地回答，“好了。放我回去吧，这才乖。” 费金把钱如数点清递到她手里，每点一张钞票都要叹一声气。他们没再多谈，相互道了一声“晚安”就分手了。 南希来到空旷的街上，在一个台阶上坐下来，有好一阵子，她仿佛全然处在困惑之中，不知道该走哪条路。忽然，她站起身来，朝着与赛克斯正在等候她返回的那个地方完全相反的方向匆匆而去，她不断加快步伐，最后逐渐变成了拼命奔跑。她一直跑得耗尽了浑身气力，才停下来喘喘气。这时她好像突然醒悟过来，意识到自己是在做一件想做而又做不到的事情，她深感痛惜，绞扭着双手，泪如泉涌。 也许是眼泪使她心头轻松了一些，要不就是意识到自己完全无能为力，总之，她掉过头，用差不多同样快的速度朝相反的方向飞奔而去――一方面是为了抢回丢失的时间，另一方面也是为了与自己汹涌的思潮保持同样的节奏――很快就到了她先前丢下那个强盗一个人呆着的住所。 即使她出现的时候多少显得有些不安，赛克斯先生也没有看出来，他只是问了一声钱拿到没有，在得到一个肯定的回答之后，他发出一声满意的怪叫，就又把脑袋搁到枕头上，继续做被她的归来打断了的美梦。 算她运气好，钞票到手的第二天，赛克斯先生尽顾了吃吃喝喝，加上在安抚他的暴躁脾气方面又产生了很好的效果，他既没有时间也没有心思对她的行为举止横挑鼻子竖挑眼了。她显得心不在焉，神经紧张，似乎即将迈出大胆而又危险的一步，而这一步是经过了激烈的斗争才下定决心的。这种神态瞒不过眼睛像山猫一样厉害的费金，他很可能会立刻警觉起来，但赛克斯先生就不一样了――他是个粗人，无论对谁一贯采取粗暴的态度，从来不为一些比较细致微妙的事操心，更何况前边已经讲过，他又正处于一种少有的好情绪之中――他看不出南希的举动有什么不对劲的地方，的的确确，他一点也没有为她操心，即使她的不安表现得远比实际情况还要引人注目，也不大可能引起他的疑心。 白昼渐渐过去了，姑娘的兴奋有增无已。天色暗下来以后，她坐在一旁，单等那个强盗醉倒入睡，她的脸颊苍白得异乎寻常，眼睛里却有一团火，连赛克斯也惊讶地注意到了。 由于发烧，赛克斯先生十分虚弱，躺在床上，正在喝为减少刺激作用而掺上热水的杜松子酒。他已经是第三次或第四次把杯子推到南希面前，要她给重新斟上，这些迹象才头一次引起他的注意。 “唔，该死的，”他用手支起身子，打量着姑娘的脸色，说道。“你看上去就跟死人活过来一样。出什么事儿了？” “出什么事儿了？”姑娘回答，“没出什么事。你这样瞪着我干吗？” “这是哪门子蠢事？”赛克斯抓住她的肩膀，狠命地摇晃，问道。“怎么回事？你是什么意思？你在想什么？” “我在想好多事，比尔，”姑娘浑身发抖，双手捂住眼睛，回答道。“可是，天啦！这有什么大不了的？” 她故作轻松，说出了最后一句话，但那种口吻给赛克斯留下的印象似乎比她开口说话之前那种慌乱任性的神态还要深一些。 “我来告诉你是咋回事吧，”赛克斯说，“你要不是得了热病，眼看着就要发作，那就是有什么事不对头了，有点危险呢。你该不是――不，他妈的。你不会于那种事。” “干什么事？”姑娘问。 “不，”赛克斯直瞪瞪地望着她，一边喃喃自语，“没有比这小娘们更死心塌地的了，要不我三个月以前就已经割断她的喉咙了。她准是要发热病了，就这么回事。” 赛克斯凭着这份信心打起精神来，将那杯酒喝了个底朝天，接着，他骂骂咧咧地叫着给他药。姑娘非常敏捷地跳起来，背朝着他迅速把药倒进杯子，端到他的嘴边，他喝光了里边的东西。 “好了，”那强盗说道，“过来坐在我旁边，拿出你平常的模样来，不然的话，我可要叫你变个样子，让你想认也认不出来。” 姑娘顺从了。赛克斯紧紧握住她的手，倒在枕头上，眼睛盯着她的脸，合上又睁开，再合上，再睁开。他不停地改变姿势，两三分钟之间，他几次差一点睡着了，又几次带着惊恐的神情坐起来，若有所失地看看周围。终于，正当他好像要强撑着起来的时候，却突然堕入了沉睡。紧抓着的手松开了，举起的胳膊软弱无力地垂在身旁。他躺在那里，不省人事。 “鸦片酊终于起作用了，”姑娘从床边站起来，喃喃地说。“现在，我也许已经赶不上了。” 她急急忙忙戴上软帽，系好披巾，一再战战兢兢地回头望望，生怕安眠药起不了作用，赛克斯的大手随时都可能搁到自己的肩上。接着她轻轻俯下身来，吻了吻那强盗的嘴唇，无声无息地把房门打开又关上，匆匆离开了这所房子。 她必须经过一条小巷才能走上大街，在黑洞洞的巷子里，一个更夫吆喝着九点半了。 “早就过了半点了？”姑娘问道。 “再过一刻钟就敲十点。”那人把提灯举到她的面前，说道。 “不花上一个多钟头我是到不了那儿了。”南希低声说了一句，飞快地从他身边跑过去，转眼间已经到了街上。 她从斯皮达菲直奔伦敦西区，沿途经过一条又一条偏僻小街，街上的许多店铺已经开始关门。钟敲十点，她越发焦躁难耐。她沿着狭窄的便道飞奔而去，胳膊肘撞得行人东倒西歪，穿过几条拥挤的街道时，她几乎是从马头下边冲过去，一群群的人正在那里焦急地等着马车过去以后再走。 “这女人发疯了。”她一冲过去，人们纷纷回过头来望一望。一进入伦敦城的几个比较富有的区域，街道就不那么拥挤了。她横冲直撞，从零零星星的行人身边匆匆赶过，大大激起了人们的好奇心。有几个在后边加快了脚步，仿佛想知道她以这样一种非同寻常的速度是奔什么地方去，还有几个人跑到她前边，回头看看，不禁对她这种毫不减慢的速度感到吃惊，但他们一个接一个全都落在了后面，当她接近目的地的时候，已经只剩她一个人。 那是一处家庭旅馆，坐落在海德公园附近一条幽静而又漂亮的街上。旅馆门前点着一盏灯，耀眼的灯光引导着她来到这个地点。这时，钟敲了十一点。她磨磨蹭蹭地走了几步，像是有些踌踌不定，又打定主意走上前去似的。钟声使她下定了决心，她走进门厅。门房的座位上空无一人。她面带难色地看了看四周，接着朝楼梯走去。 “喂，小姐！”一个衣着华丽的女人从她身后一道门里往外张望着，说道。“你上这儿找谁呀？” “找一位住在这里的小姐。”姑娘回答。 “一位小姐？”伴随着回答而来的是一道嘲笑的眼色。“哪儿来什么小姐？” “梅莱小姐。”南希说。 少妇直到这个时候才注意到南希的模样，不由得鄙弃地瞥了她一眼，叫了一个男侍者来招呼她。南希将自己的请求说了一遍。 “我该怎样称呼呢？”侍者问。 “怎么称呼都没关系。”南希回答。 “也不用说是什么事？”侍者说。 “是的，也不用说，”姑娘答道，“我必须见见这位小姐。” “得了吧。”侍者说着，便将她朝门外推。“没有这样的事。出去出去。” “除非你们把我抬出去。”南希不顾一切地说，“而且我会叫你们两个人吃不了兜着走。有没有人，”她看了看四周，说道，“愿意为像我这样的可怜人捎个口信？” 这一番恳求打动了一个面慈心善的厨子，他正和另外几个侍者在一旁观望，便上前排难解纷。 “你替她传上去不就行了，乔依？”厨子说道。 “这有什么用？”侍者回答，“你该不会认为小姐愿意见她这号人吧，唔？” 这句话暗示南希身份可疑，四个女仆贞洁的胸中激起了极大的义愤，几个人慷慨激昂，宣称这娘们给所有的女性丢脸，极力主张将她毫不客气地扔到阴沟里去。 “你们爱把我怎么样就怎么样，”姑娘说着，再一次朝几位男士转过头去。“只要先答应我的请求，求你们看在万能的上帝分上，捎个信上去。” 软心肠的厨子又作了一番调解，结果还是最早露面的那个待者答应为她通报。 “怎么说呢？”他一只脚踏在楼梯上说道。 “就说，有个年轻女人真心实意地请求跟梅莱小姐单独谈谈，”南希道，“你就说，小姐只要听听她非说不可的头一句话，就会明白是听她往下说，还是把她当成骗子赶出门去。” “我说，”那男子说，“你还真有办法。” “你去通报吧，”南希果断地说，“我要听回音。” 侍者快步上楼去了。南希站在原地，她脸色惨白，气急败坏，听着几个贞洁的侍女冷言冷语地大声议论，她气得嘴唇直哆嗦。那几个传女在这方面很有些本事，男持者回来了，叫她上楼去，这时她们越发显出本事来。 “这个世道，规矩人真是做不得。”第一个侍女说道。 “破铜烂铁也比用火炼过的金子值钱。”第二位说。 第三个尽顾了感叹：“有身份的女士是些什么东西。”第四位用一句“丢人现眼”为一首四重唱开了个头，这几位守身如玉的狄安娜女神又用同一句话作为结尾。 南希没理会她们那一套，因为她心里还装着更要紧的事，她浑身发抖，跟在男侍者身后，走进一间天花板上点着一盏吊灯的小会客室。侍者将她领到这里，就退了出去。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/97/5095.html","bookId":474,"book":{"id":474,"title":"Oliver
