My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn\u0027t slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end��the end of everything.\n But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn\u0027t running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today.\n Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren\u0027t trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square.\n And I couldn\u0027t run fast enough.\n So it didn\u0027t matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late��and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live.\n The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-1.html","bookId":2024,"book":{"id":2024,"title":"The Twilight Saga 2: New Moon (Twilight #2)","description":"Storyline: \n New Moon is a fantasy novel by author Stephenie Meyer, and is the second novel in the Twilight series.
