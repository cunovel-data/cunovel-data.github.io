{"id":2788,"title":"Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1)","description":"Storyline: Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1) \\n If Sadie Turner is good at anything, it\u0027s putting stuff in order. So when she finds her \"perfect\" life in disarray, she hopes a summer vacation at her aunt\u0027s lake house will help her piece it back together. She wants to relax, reboot, and heal the wounds left by her cheating ex-husband. And that requires time away from men. All men. Or so she thinks. With two slobbering dogs and two cousins living there - one a flamboyant decorator intent on making over Sadie - it\u0027s hard to get a moment\u0027s peace at eccentric Aunt Dody\u0027s house, especially with everyone so determined to set her up with Desmond, the sexy new neighbor. Desmond is Sadie\u0027s worst nightmare. Tall, tanned, muscular...and to top it off, he\u0027s great with her kids. But he must have a flaw - he\u0027s a man - so Sadie vows to keep her distance. As summer blazes on, the life Sadie is trying so hard to simplify only becomes more complicated - a new career presents itself, her evil ex haunts her, and Aunt Dody reveals a tragic secret - but maybe a little chaos is just what Sadie needs to get her life back in order.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1.jpg","author":"Tracy Brogan","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
