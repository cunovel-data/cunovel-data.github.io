{"id":89159,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"I WOKE UP THE NEXT morning filled with a buoyancy I hadn\u0027t felt in years. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and a handsome man who was in no way related to me had stayed for dinner. Oh, I knew it didn\u0027t mean anything. But the flirting was fun and having him there had been exciting, like watching a storm roll in from over the lake and wondering where the lightning might strike. I zipped through my morning grooming routine so I could call Penny. She\u0027d get a kick out of this. \"Hello?\" She sounded grumpy. I must have woken her up. \"Hi. Go pee and call me back.\" As a sign of respect, we had agreed to never use the toilet while talking to each other on the phone. Well, it was partly out of respect and partly because of the time Penny dropped her brand new cell phone in the toilet. \"I already peed. And I\u0027m not pregnant.\" She sighed. \"Oh, Penn. I\u0027m sorry. Sometimes it takes a while.\" \"Yeah, I know. I just thought it would be fun if it happened right away. It\u0027s been three months already. We tried for a couple months before I even told you.\" \"It\u0027ll happen. Didn\u0027t Jeff tell you he has bionic sperm?\" Penny sighed again. \"No, he says he\u0027s got a bionic penis.\" \"Oh. That\u0027s different.\" \"Yeah. If only it were true. Anyway, what\u0027s up with you? How\u0027s life in Dody\u0027s world?\" Penny never wallowed in self-pity for long. That was my department. \"Guess who ate dinner with us last night?\" I fell back onto the bed and put my feet up on the wall like I used to do as a teenager. \"I don\u0027t know. Richard?\" \"Ugh! God, no. Why would you even think that?\" I heard her huff. \"I\u0027m still in a bad mood. Just tell me.\" This should cheer her up. \"Running Man!\" \"The good-looking guy who runs on the beach every day?\" \"That\u0027s the one.\" I provided her with my abbreviated version of last night\u0027s events, including the fact that he had an adorable cowlick right in the front. \"He\u0027s staying at the Pullmans\u0027?\" she asked. \"Yes, while they\u0027re on vacation. He said they\u0027re traveling around Europe for two months and then going to visit their daughter in Arizona. Des is Dr. Pullman\u0027s temporary replacement at the hospital.\" \"What happens when they come back?\" I readjusted the pillows behind my head. \"I don\u0027t know. I guess he goes back to Chicago. Does it matter?\" \"Hmm.\" That was not an ordinary, run-of-the-mill hmm. It was fraught with meaning. I sat up on the bed. \"What, hmm?\" \"He sounds like a perfect transitional man. You know, get a little wet in the dating pool, as it were.\" I fell back on the covers. \"Great, you sound like Dody and Fontaine. Just because I think he\u0027s cute, don\u0027t go making something out of it.\" \"Hey, I\u0027m not the one who called at the butt crack of dawn to chat about him,\" she teased. \"Hardly the butt crack of dawn, you lazy ass. It\u0027s nine o\u0027clock. Once you have that baby you\u0027ll be getting up before the sun. Speaking of that, I should see if my kids are poking forks into the toaster. And I\u0027m determined to get them in the lake today. They\u0027re still too chicken to swim. I\u0027ll call you later, OK?\" \"OK, I\u0027ll be around. Probably doing yoga and thinking fertile thoughts. Oh, and before I forget, I happened to be over by your place the other day and your grass looks terrible. It\u0027s turning brown.\" \"It is? It looked fine to me last week. I wonder if the sprinkler system is messed up again. Can you check on that?\" \"I can try, but you guys have that hi-tech system. I\u0027d have an easier time defusing a bomb. Can\u0027t you ask Richard?\" My stomach churned. \"If I do, he\u0027s going to tell me I\u0027m the one who messed it up, whether I did or not. I hate to give him the ammunition.\" It was so easy now, being annoyed with Richard even when he wasn\u0027t there. It hadn\u0027t always been that way. I fell in love with him the day we met, but I\u0027d been slowly trying to claw my way out of that hole ever since. Still, maybe he\u0027d surprise me and be gracious and helpful. Yeah, and maybe I was a D cup. I looked down at my barely Bs and sighed. Nope. Some things would never change. \"Mommy, it\u0027s too cold!\" Paige screeched. \"The waves are ginormous.\" \"Stop it. They\u0027re, like, ankle deep. Come on! Just get your feet wet. Mommy is right here.\" We\u0027d been down at the lake for an hour, and my brave little soldiers still refused to dip so much as a pinky toe into Lake Michigan. Fontaine sat on a lounge chair while wearing one of Dody\u0027s sun hats. The effect was quite spectacular. \"The water is too big, Mommy!\" Jordan shouted from his safe spot behind Fontaine\u0027s back. \"I don\u0027t like it.\" \"Seriously, you guys! If you\u0027re not going to play in the water, we may as well go back to Glenville.\" Paige gasped. \"You can\u0027t take us back yet, Mommy! Aunt Dody promised to teach me how to bejewel!\" \"I\u0027m not going home,\" Jordan pouted. \"And I\u0027m not swimming either. I\u0027ll swim when I\u0027m big as Jasper.\" This battle was lost. It was too beautiful a day to argue with them. \"Fine, fine, fine. You guys win. But sooner or later you\u0027re going to have to get in this lake.\" I walked from the shore and slumped down in the sand next to Fontaine. Paige gave Jordan a fist bump of victory before they took off for drier ground. Fontaine ruffled my hair. \"You wouldn\u0027t swim when you were little either. Don\u0027t you remember?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s why I\u0027m so anxious to get them in the water, so they\u0027ll realize there\u0027s nothing to be afraid of.\" That was a lie, actually. I knew there were tons of things to be afraid of in that lake. Slimy, sinister creatures lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to grab your ankle and pull you under. Like gargantuan electric eels or waterlogged corpses from the Edmund Fitzgerald. OK, so that sank in Lake Erie, but still... Fontaine adjusted his Dolce \u0026 Gabbana sunglasses. \"Right. So anyway, I talked to my boss, Kyle, and he agrees this organizing thing could be a massive hit with our clientele. He wants to meet you.\" I sat up straight. \"Are you crazy? I\u0027m not ready for that. I\u0027m not sure I want to do it at all. I\u0027m here on vacation, remember?\" \"Oh, relax, spazmotron. Just talk to him and hear what he has to say. He\u0027s a dreamboat to work with and you\u0027ll love him.\" He brushed sand from one foot with the other. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s marvelous if he can stand working with you, but that\u0027s still not the point. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing. I haven\u0027t had any special training. I mean, cleaning Dody\u0027s closets is one thing, but organizing for somebody else would be too scary.\" I shook my head. \"Too scary?\" He pulled those same sunglasses down his nose and peered at me over the rim. \"Too scary, like swimming in a lake just because you can\u0027t see the bottom? Honestly, woman, have some cojones. Take a risk once in a while.\" A hot wind swirled around us, stirring up sand and stinging me like Fontaine\u0027s words. \"That\u0027s not fair. I take risks. Didn\u0027t I let you talk me into this new haircut? And color? Am I not wearing blue fingernail polish? If that\u0027s not a risk, I don\u0027t know what is.\" Fontaine pushed the sunglasses back up. \"Look, you finally divorced the Big Dick. And that is a major step in the right direction. But what have you done to get your life rolling again? And you know I\u0027m not talking about nail polish.\" I didn\u0027t like this conversation. It was hard enough to ignore Fontaine\u0027s suggestions when he was being silly, but when he was being earnest, it was twice as bad. Once he sank his teeth into something, he was relentless. \"It\u0027s only been a few weeks, you know.\" \"Liar. It\u0027s been over a year since you broke up with Richard. What are you waiting for?\" I kicked sand over his feet, pretending it was an accident. I wanted to defend myself and say I\u0027d been doing all kinds of bold and risky stuff, but I couldn\u0027t think of one thing. After catching Richard with that redhead, my life had been occupied with divorce proceedings and trying to get through each day without doing permanent psychological damage to my children. I\u0027d had a garage sale, bought new bed linens, burned the old ones, and changed all my lamps over to energy-saving bulbs. Other than that, I was pretty much on autopilot. \"It\u0027s not that easy, Fontaine,\" I whispered. He put his arm around me. \"I know, sugarplum. But it\u0027s time. And organizing is something you\u0027re really good at. So you should make the most of it. Plus it\u0027s something you can do once you\u0027re back in Glenville. Just think about it. I told Kyle we\u0027d have lunch with him tomorrow.\" I jumped up, scattering sand everywhere. \"Fontaine! Why did you do that? I\u0027m not ready.\" \"Fake it till you make it, baby girl. Just trust me on this.\" He stood up and patted my shoulder. \"You\u0027ll be fabulous. I\u0027ll take the kids up to the house now, and you think about it.\" He gestured to the kids, and they skipped after him up the steps, leaving me to stare out over the water and ponder. I bit my lip. It was ridiculous, me trying to be a professional anything. Sure, I was great at figuring out which cupboard should hold baking supplies and which should hold the coffee cups. And maybe Dody\u0027s efficient new pantry did sparkle with crisp, color-coded labels. But that didn\u0027t mean I was some kind of expert. Still, what was the worst thing that could go wrong? Somebody wouldn\u0027t like the font I used for their labels? Or they\u0027d think alphabetized spice racks were overkill? Maybe Fontaine was right. I was good at putting things in order. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to start doing that with my own life. Maybe I could do this. Hadn\u0027t I already organized kitchens and closets for my friends back home? I could do the same for complete strangers, right? I sat back down in the sand and let my mind wander over the wonderful possibilities. And there were loads of them. Then I mentally categorized those possibilities. Because that\u0027s what I do. As I soaked up the sun, I came up with a plan. Sure, it might be a little risky. But hey, I was a gal wearing blue nail polish. I could take on anything. By late afternoon, my euphoria, like a tan heading into September, was patchy and fading fast. Back at the house, the brief blip of enthusiasm I\u0027d felt over Fontaine\u0027s idea had turned to pure dread. I didn\u0027t know the first thing about being professional at anything. And the flirty joy Des had stirred up in me at dinner last night was as dead as a fish rotting on the sand. It stank like that too. The good doctor had been charming, yes. But that had nothing to do with me. He was a nice guy doing a neighborly house call for a crazy old lady, and that\u0027s all there was to that. He must have swarms of women buzzing around. I was nothing more than another drone in his ear. Not that I cared, because I wasn\u0027t interested in a relationship. And Penny\u0027s stupid notion of a transitional man? What was that all about? Anyway, he probably had a girlfriend. No doubt some Argentinean supermodel currently on a Sports Illustrated photo shoot. After he\u0027d left our house last night, they\u0027d probably had scandalously wicked phone sex while I, on the other hand, had put on my rattiest pajamas and watched Animal Planet with Fontaine. What the hell was I thinking, getting all fluttery and jittery over some sweet-talking, muscle-bound iron man? Had Richard taught me nothing? \"What is your problem?\" Jasper snapped as I slammed the dishwasher door. \"Nothing!\" Being unmarried, Jasper naively thought I meant it. \"Then be careful. You\u0027ll break the dishes.\" \"Mommy, did Daddy call today?\" Paige wandered into the kitchen. Jordan was sitting at the island, eating ice cream from a dog bowl, because Dody thought serving food in a dog bowl was the funniest thing in the world. I could only pray she had washed it first. \"No, baby, he hasn\u0027t. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll call soon.\" I looked at my watch. Classic Richard. He\u0027d promised to call at lunch, but it was much closer to dinner. When Dody\u0027s phone rang fifteen minutes later, I let Paige answer. She chatted on the line for a minute, so I knew it must be him. Better late than never, I guess. Then she handed the phone to me. \"He wants to talk to you.\" Ugh! Talking to the sperm-donor-formerly-known-as-my-husband was just the garlic frosting I needed on this total piece of shit day. \"What do you want, Richard?\" I grumbled into the phone. A moment of silence ensued. \"Richard?\" I barked, my voice unpleasantly loud. \"Uh, no, it\u0027s Des.\" My throat went dry, like a wooly mitten was stuck inside. Shit. Shit. \"Sorry. I thought you were somebody else,\" I choked out. His laugh was shallow. \"Yeah, I get that a lot. Women wishing I was somebody else.\" My own chuckle sounded equally false. My temples suddenly throbbed as if an alien were scratching his way out. I bit my lip and pressed my hand to my head. \"I wondered how Dody was feeling,\" he added after another awkward pause. \"I can stop over if you want me to.\" Dody was fine. She\u0027d beaten me at five games of backgammon that afternoon and only skipped her tai chi class because Harry took her for a ride on his Harley. I didn\u0027t want Des coming over. Seeing him again would just prolong the torment for me. I wanted to go back to watching him anonymously on the beach and not knowing his name or that he had a fluffy gray cat and no wife. \"No, don\u0027t bother. Thanks, but Dody\u0027s fine.\" \"I\u0027m not fine!\" Dody shouted, trotting in from the sunporch. \"Is that Des? Tell him it hurts! Tell him I\u0027m dizzy. I\u0027m seeing spots. Give me the phone, Sadie! Give me that phone.\" She tried to wrestle it from my hand. I covered the receiver and twisted away from her. \"God, Dody! Be quiet. Don\u0027t be silly.\" \"It\u0027s really no bother,\" I heard Des saying on the line. \"I\u0027m on my way home anyway.\" Dody snatched the phone. She was certainly agile and strong for somebody needing a doctor. \"Please do stop by, Des, dear. I\u0027d feel so much better if you did. I\u0027ve been feeling the teensiest bit light-headed this evening.\" I rolled my eyes. She was using her breathy, Elizabeth Taylor voice. And she was light-headed because Fontaine had given her a quadruple martini. What a faker. The only reason she wanted him over here was to try and get me laid. Oh, fine then. Let the Patron Saint of Desperate Housewives bestow upon us the blessings of his company. I still wasn\u0027t on the market. I didn\u0027t need a transitional man. I didn\u0027t need any man. I was fine. I stomped upstairs and threw myself on the bed, wondering if every divorced woman felt this way or if I was just that special. I never should have let myself get worked up over him in the first place. Or this job business. It was all too ridiculous. Minutes later, Fontaine\u0027s well-coiffed head appeared around the door frame. \"What the hell are you doing? The McKnight in Shining Armor is on his way.\" \"So?\" \"So, primp. Do some fluffing and some poufing. Time\u0027s a-wasting.\" He grabbed me by the ankle to pull me from the bed. I tried to kick him with my other leg. \"Fontaine, he\u0027s coming to see Dody, not me. I\u0027m not interested. And even if I was, which again, I\u0027m not, I refuse to make a fool of myself.\" He dropped my foot. \"Are you really that dense? Did you not catch him checking you out last night?\" I sat up. \"He was not checking me out.\" \"He was! Even though you looked like hell. So let\u0027s glam you up a little and get this party started.\" He flung open the closet door and began rummaging. Ego tapped me on the shoulder. Fontaine\u0027s compliment was taking effect. \"Did he really check me out, or are you just saying that?\" Fontaine avoided eye contact. \"Baby girl, would I lie to you?\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s true. I would. But I\u0027m not lying to you now, so get your butt in that bathroom and put on some mascara already!\" By the time Dr. McRunning Man arrived, I had brushed, flossed, moisturized, blotted, and put on a sundress. Fontaine peeked out the bathroom window when we heard a car in the driveway. \"BMW convertible,\" he said. Of course. What better way to showcase his Argentinean supermodel? I looked in the mirror, hoping to see a miraculous transformation, but I was as average as ever. \"I love your new \u0027do,\" Fontaine said, fluffing my hair. \"I was right about going with the darker brown. You should never argue with me again.\" \"Brown hair and brown eyes. It\u0027s kind of boring, isn\u0027t it?\" I asked. \"No, it makes you exotic and mysterious.\" I snorted with laughter at my own expense. I was about as exotic as vanilla yogurt. \"Well, the snorting isn\u0027t very sexy. You might want to work on that.\" Fontaine left the bathroom and trotted downstairs to open the door. I hesitated another minute. I didn\u0027t want us all pouncing on Des the moment he arrived. I should let him get in and settled so I could make an entrance. Even though I cared nothing about him. This was just for practice. I heard the door open and shut, and voices wafted up the stairs. Oh, God. The accent was killing me. \"Hello, Fontaine. Mrs. Baker. How are you feeling today?\" \"Fine, now that you\u0027re here. I\u0027m sure I asked you to call me Dody.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he answered. I moved to the top of the stairs, counting to one hundred, and then I strolled down like I just happened to be passing through the family room on my way to somewhere intriguing. I caught sight of Dody swooning on the chaise again, wearing a red-and-gold silk robe. It was gift from Uncle Walter for their sixteenth wedding anniversary, allegedly purchased at the Great Wall of China gift shop. Des was sitting by her side, her wrist in his hand. He looked up, and my breath caught. Was that a hint of positive appraisal in his expression? I sucked in my stomach, just in case, and smiled. \"Oh, hello.\" Fontaine shook his head and turned his back, pretending to cough. \"Hi, Sadie. You look nice,\" Des said. Dody nearly clapped her hands with glee. \"Oh, thanks,\" I said again, plucking at the top of my sundress in the universal gesture of \"you mean this old thing?\" Jordan ran over, wrapping arms tightly around my waist. \"Why are you so pretty, Mommy?\" I smoothed his hair and whispered, \"It\u0027s just a sundress, honey. Mommy wears them all the time.\" \"No, you don\u0027t.\" Jordan frowned. \"Would you like some candy, J-man?\" Fontaine asked, nipping this conversation in the bud. Thank you, Fontaine. Des turned back to Dody. \"Shall we have a look?\" He took off the bandage, and Paige leaned in close against his arm, resting her hand on his shoulder. \"Wow, those snitches are weird,\" she said. He smiled. \"You think so?\" Paige nodded. \"Definitely. Like Frankenstein, only not so green.\" \"Paige, back up. Give him some room.\" I tugged on the back of her shirt. \"She\u0027s all right,\" he said. \"Paige, hand me that white square thing.\" She reached into his backpack and pulled out some gauze. We watched while he applied some ointment and a fresh bandage. \"Des?\" Paige whispered, leaning toward his neck. \"What?\" \"I like your perfume.\" His head went up for a second then dropped to his chest. I remembered the story of his sister spraying him with her flowery perfume. \"It\u0027s cologne, Paige,\" I corrected. \"When a boy wears it, it\u0027s called cologne.\" Dody piped in, \"I can\u0027t smell anything. Lean over here, dear. Give me a whiff.\" \"Oh my God, Dody!\" I gasped. \"You can\u0027t ask to smell somebody. It\u0027s rude!\" Des\u0027s face flushed. \"No, it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s rude to say they smell. Not to ask to smell them. Besides, I know he smells good. You told me so last night.\" Des\u0027s head lifted, his smile instant as he looked at me. Now it was my turn to blush. \"He only stayed about twenty minutes,\" I told Penny over the phone, taking a sip of merlot. I needed to decompress and debrief over the recent visit from the man I cared nothing about. From my vantage point on the deck I could keep a judicious eye on my kids, who were playing on the beach. Not that I worried they\u0027d go in the water. Still no chance of that. \"It\u0027s Saturday. Do you think he had a date?\" she asked. \"He said he had work to do. Sounds suspicious to me.\" \"Everything sounds suspicious to you.\" \"With good reason. If he\u0027s not at the hospital, what could he be doing?\" Her chuckle was loud in my ear. \"Maybe he\u0027s a vampire. Or a male escort.\" \"Or both,\" I mused. \"Paige told him she liked his perfume. And Dody asked if he was wearing shoulder pads.\" Dody had yet to give up on the eighties shoulder pad craze, certain it was making a comeback. She heard somewhere, probably during the eighties, that shoulder pads made your hips look slimmer. So she\u0027d tuck in three or four at a time inside her blouse, only she wouldn\u0027t pin them, so inevitably they\u0027d fall down, creating migratory lumps all over her torso. Eventually they\u0027d fall out of her sleeves, leaving a trail like Hansel and Gretel. \"I assume he wasn\u0027t wearing shoulder pads,\" Penny said. \"No,\" I sighed. \"The shoulders were all his own.\" \"Did you invite him for dinner?\" \"No, because Jasper wasn\u0027t home and I\u0027ve forgotten how to cook. Besides, it would\u0027ve seemed desperate. Anyway, it\u0027s not like I wanted him to stay.\" I drained my glass in a final gulp. \"Uh-huh.\" \"You know what\u0027s kind of weird, though?\" \"Richard\u0027s inordinately huge nostrils?\" \"Besides that.\" (They weren\u0027t that huge, by the way.) \"Jordan is starting to trust him. You know how shy and clingy he\u0027s been since Richard left. But after Des changed Dody\u0027s bandage, Jordan started showing him his trucks.\" \"Weird,\" Penny agreed. \"Maybe it\u0027s like how dogs can sense a dog person.\" \"You think my kids are like dogs?\" \"No. Well, a little. But I mean, maybe he likes kids and they can sense that. He\u0027s an ER doctor, right? He\u0027s probably had lots of practice putting kids at ease.\" Disappointment flicked me in the forehead for not thinking of that on my own. Any connection he had with my kids wasn\u0027t some grand sign from the universe. Once again, it was just his good bedside manner.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-6.html","bookId":2788,"book":{"id":2788,"title":"Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1)","description":"Storyline: Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1) If Sadie Turner is good at anything, it\u0027s putting stuff in order.
