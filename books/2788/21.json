{"id":89174,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"IT\u0027S ONLY A TOOTHBRUSH, SADIE. Maybe it\u0027s because you have terrible breath.\" I was sitting in Penny\u0027s garish ladybug kitchen before picking the kids up from Richard\u0027s. Des was spending the next few days in Seattle at a medical conference so I had some time to wander. I stirred my lemonade, wondering if she was right. Maybe I was reading too much into it. \"I just think it was cute.\" She rubbed her still-flat tummy, a habit she\u0027d developed since learning she was pregnant. \"It is cute, definitely. But you shouldn\u0027t move there for some guy, especially one who may not be staying.\" \"Dody\u0027s the one who keeps saying I\u0027m moving there. I never said that!\" \"Not directly, but you\u0027ve been dropping hints all over the place. All you can talk about is how fun it is and how friendly everybody is and how much better than Glenville it is. Honestly, it\u0027s like you don\u0027t even care how you\u0027d be totally abandoning me right when my baby gets here!\" Penny covered her face with her arms and burst into tears. Ah, those first-trimester hormones are powerful little bastards. They will kick you in the knees and make you fall flat on your weepy face. I set my lemonade down to hug Penny\u0027s heaving shoulders. \"I\u0027m not moving there. I agree it would be stupid.\" \"But it wouldn\u0027t!\" she hiccupped. \"It would make perfect sense. It is so much better there than here. Where am I supposed to take my kids to play? There are no parks within walking distance of my house. There isn\u0027t a beach or fudge shops or kite stores. Bell Harbor has that, plus those cute little houses that all look different from each other.\" She wiped her face. \"Just think of it. You could buy a darling little bungalow and paint it purple if you wanted to. I have to get a frickin\u0027 dispensation from the pope to put a birdbath in my yard, stupid neighborhood association.\" \"Maybe you should move to Bell Harbor,\" I said. \"Maybe I will, but you go first.\" I sat back down, wishing there was some gin in my lemonade. \"So now you\u0027re saying I should move there?\" \"Probably. But don\u0027t do it for some guy.\" When Dody and Fontaine had suggested I move, it was easy to dismiss the notion. After all, Fontaine had business motives and Dody is a whack job. But Penny adding her name to the petition changed things. \"Wouldn\u0027t you miss me?\" She hiccupped again. \"Yes, but I\u0027d come to see you all the time. Princess Buttercup loves the water.\" \"Who is Princess Buttercup?\" \"My baby. That\u0027s what Jeff calls her.\" \"But what if it\u0027s a boy?\" \"Then he\u0027s going to get beat up a lot.\" The television blared through the door of Richard\u0027s apartment. I knocked a second time, and Jordan opened it a minute later. \"Hi, Mommy.\" He jumped into my arms, squeezing me tight. That would never get old. \"Hello, beautiful,\" Richard purred. Oh, that was definitely old. I stepped through the door into his starkly furnished apartment. \"Wow. I love what you\u0027ve done with the place.\" Richard chuckled. \"Yeah, well, you kept all the furniture, remember?\" I smiled. \"Are the kids all packed?\" The sooner I could get out of there the better. \"What\u0027s your rush? Would you like a drink?\" \"No, thanks. We have to run. And I\u0027m driving.\" \"Got a hot date back in Mayberry with this Dezzz character the kids keep buzzing about? Who are they talking about?\" \"Nobody special. Just a friend.\" I kicked aside a newspaper on the floor, looking for the kids\u0027 shoes. \"A friend, huh?\" Richard leaned against the wall. \"Friends are good to have. Is it serious?\" I stopped looking for shoes and gave Richard a stern look. \"That\u0027s not exactly your business, is it?\" He smirked. \"Oh, so it is serious? What kind of name is Dezzz? Is he a biker or something?\" I saw Paige\u0027s sandal stuffed under a couch cushion and crossed the room to pull it out. \"He\u0027s a doctor. Come on, kids. Help me get your stuff together.\" Paige hopped around on one foot. \"Mommy, where\u0027s my other shoe?\" \"It\u0027s here, baby. Let me help you.\" We scurried around, gathering their things and stuffing them into a duffel bag. I didn\u0027t take extra time to fold anything. It would all go into the wash as soon as I got back to Dody\u0027s anyway. \"Daddy, don\u0027t drink my juice box, OK? Save it for me,\" Jordan told him. \"OK, J. I will. Are you sure you have to rush off, Sade? We could order a pizza, open a bottle of wine. You could tell me all about your new friend. Or better yet, we could reminisce.\" His innuendo was loud and clear. Let\u0027s put on a movie for the kids and sneak into the other room for a quickie. I shook my head vehemently. \"No, I have stuff to do. I need to stop by the house before we head back to Bell Harbor.\" He frowned. \"You don\u0027t need to check on the house. I could do that for you, you know.\" \"That\u0027s nice of you to offer, Richard, but I have a couple things I\u0027d like to pick up. Kids, give Daddy a smooch. We have to go.\" Paige kissed his cheek and he gave her a hug. Jordan tried to do the same. \"Hey, J. Real men shake hands, remember?\" Richard chided. I bit my tongue. Heaven forbid Richard\u0027s son show any sensitivity. Jordan nodded and held out his hand. \"OK, I think that\u0027s everything,\" I said. \"See you later, Richard.\" I started to walk out the door. The kids scampered ahead but Richard gripped my arm and squeezed. \"Sadie, tell the truth. Is it serious between you and this guy?\" Was he jealous? After all this time and all he\u0027d put me through? I wasn\u0027t naive enough to think it was serious with Des. I didn\u0027t know if it ever would be, but I wasn\u0027t about to let Richard know that. \"It\u0027s desperately serious, Richard. I\u0027ve never been so in love.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-21.html","bookId":2788,"book":{"id":2788,"title":"Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1)","description":"Storyline: Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1) If Sadie Turner is good at anything, it\u0027s putting stuff in order.
