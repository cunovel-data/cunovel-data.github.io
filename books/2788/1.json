{"id":89154,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"MY HUSBAND HAD A TALENT for putting the dick in unpredictable, so I wasn\u0027t entirely surprised to catch him at an office party with his hand up the skirt of a giggly, jiggly redhead. Or that he had mistletoe dangling from his belt buckle. Even though it wasn\u0027t Christmas. Suddenly eight years of wondering if I was paranoid or intuitive were finally answered. Richard was cheating on me, and I couldn\u0027t ignore it any longer.\n I probably should have left him sooner, but I was dumb in love, plus my mother thought divorce was tacky even though she\u0027d been through one herself. Maybe she worried I couldn\u0027t do any better. Turns out, I couldn\u0027t have done much worse.\n Exactly one year, six days, and fourteen hours later, Richard and I signed on the dotted line and our marriage dissolved, like margarita salt on the tongue, leaving behind the bitter aftertaste of something that started out sweet but ended sour.\n The details of our sordid divorce prompted a feeding frenzy for the local Glenville press. Richard was the city\u0027s favorite son, after all, and everyone wanted the juiciest morsel for their evening headline. His job as anchorman of Channel Seven news earned him a quasi-celebrity status and a sycophantic following. I, on the other hand, was painted in a single stroke as a gold-digging Real Housewife just after his cash. No one but me seemed to remember the incident with the redhead, and somehow I became the pariah, a one-dimensional villain trapped inside the reality show of my own life. So when my aunt Dody called to invite the kids and me to spend the summer with her in tiny Bell Harbor, Michigan, it was an offer too good to refuse.\n \"You need a good psychic cleansing, Sadie,\" Dody told me over the phone. \"It\u0027s time to purge all of Richard\u0027s nasty karma right out of your system.\"\n I had zero faith in her tarot-reading, angel-guided, crystal-waving nonsense, but I was desperate for a vacation. And a chance to hide. Her pink clapboard house, perched high on a hill overlooking Lake Michigan, was the perfect spot to rest, reboot, and figure out what the hell to do with the next fifty years of my life. Sure, I\u0027d probably be dead long before that, but I hate leaving things to chance.\n I guided my SUV along the narrow, elm-lined avenues of Bell Harbor. Lowering the window, I breathed in deeply. The scent of hot sand tinged with tanning oil and lilacs reminded me of carefree summers, back before I cared about damaging UV rays and toxins in the lake. The buzz of cicadas nearly drowned out the sound of waves splashing on the nearby shore.\n What a drastic change from the shimmering heat and road-warrior mentality of Glenville\u0027s asphalt raceway. Bell Harbor seemed frozen in a moment that never existed anyplace else, untouched by the tawdriness of life outside its borders. Like enchanted Brigadoon, except around here people didn\u0027t randomly burst into song and dance. Or maybe they did and I just never noticed.\n I drove on, past pale houses with spindly white porches draped with American flags. A scruffy yellow dog sporting a red bandana trotted down the sidewalk, his tail swinging high as if he had someplace important to be. Then around the last curve in the road, Dody\u0027s yard burst into view. Like at a discount garden store, flowers were everywhere, some real, some silk, some faded and plastic. Overgrown azalea bushes crowded around birdbaths, iron benches, and assorted stone statues of angels and gnomes. My heart thumped unexpectedly against my rib cage like a firefly trying to escape a glass jar.\n \"Wow! Look at all the junk!\" gasped my daughter, Paige. At six years old, she was a master at stating the obvious.\n \"There\u0027s dorfs,\" added four-year-old Jordan. \"One, two, free, four - \"\n \"Those are gnomes, dumdum. And anyway, you\u0027re not supposed to call them dorfs because it\u0027s rude.\"\n \"So is calling me dumdum, stupid head.\"\n \"That\u0027s enough, you two. We don\u0027t call anyone dumdum or stupid head,\" I said.\n My children had spent the better part of our two-hour drive from Glenville in heated debate over such inane topics as whether or not a pixie is bigger than the tooth fairy, if all giraffes have the same number of spots, and where one might find, and I quote, \"the poop hole on a mermaid.\" Jordan, being his father\u0027s son, could not resist taking sides in an argument, no matter how arbitrary the topic. My head was numb from their banter.\n I parked the car in Dody\u0027s driveway and pulled the keys from the ignition. Paige pushed open her door and exploded from the backseat like popcorn, with Jordan fast on her heels. They sprinted into the dense growth of the overburdened flower beds and began running zigzag patterns around the sculptures.\n \"Be careful in that mess of weeds!\" I called out. \"There might be prickers in there!\"\n They went on, heedless of my warning. I\u0027d be pulling slivers from their feet tonight for certain.\n I climbed out of the car and headed up the faded wooden steps into Aunt Dody\u0027s house. I hadn\u0027t been there in more than a year, but I opened the door without knocking. The trusting folks of Bell Harbor didn\u0027t knock - or lock their doors either. And they liked it when you called them folks, which is a word I don\u0027t normally use, but since I was there for the summer I should try to fit in.\n The moment my strappy sandal touched cracked peach linoleum, the wild disarray of mismatched everything landed a gut punch to my minimalist sensibilities. Clutter, both dazzling and unnerving, rendered me breathless. A macrame owl with beady wooden eyes peered vacantly from across the room. A ferret cage, long missing its musky occupant, overflowed with dusty silk roses. A memorial gesture to his passing, no doubt. Porcelain ballerinas competed for shelf domination with Elvis bobbleheads. And a moose head, with its enormous antlers spanning the distance of the mantel over the stone fireplace, had a Detroit Tigers baseball cap dangling rakishly over one ear. My chest squeezed tight. Dody\u0027s garage-sale decor always disoriented me.\n No one would ever accuse her of being a meticulous housekeeper. No one ever accused me of being anything but.\n \"Dody? Hello?\" I called out.\n The clickety-clack of doggy claws on the floor offered a brief warning before I was slammed unceremoniously against the wall as Lazyboy and Fatso, two burly, uncouth hounds of indeterminate breed and negligible manners, slathered me with wet, sloppy kisses. Their love was unconditional, their drool indiscriminate. I raised a knee to nudge them away, but they persisted as if I had bacon in my pocket. They quivered with adoration.\n Oh, to be a dog and experience such uninhibited joy.\n \"Dody,\" I shouted again. \"Call off the dogs!\"\n \"Sadie? Darling, is that you? At last!\"\n My aunt careened around the corner, flailing her tanned arms high above blonde curls. Either she was excited to see me or the house was on fire. Her turquoise kimono was covered by a pink flowered apron. Expertly shoving the dogs aside with one plump hip, she gathered me in her robust, anaconda-like hug.\n \"I thought you\u0027d never get here! How was the drive?\" She pushed with the other hip as the dogs tried to assault me again. \"Did you come down Main and see the new post office? Aren\u0027t the gargoyles fabulous? Thank goodness you didn\u0027t have to worry about snow. But then it\u0027s June so of course there wouldn\u0027t be any. Lazy, get off my foot.\" She pushed him with her hand. \"Well? Where are the children! Are they here?\"\n My aunt was a tsunami in fuzzy slippers. And for some reason, a kimono.\n \"They\u0027re outside counting gnomes.\"\n Her eyes sparkled. \"Oh, I can\u0027t wait to see them. Have they grown? Of course they have.\"\n She pulled me back toward the door and smacked the screen with such force it swung open, whacked against the side of the house, and slammed back shut.\n She shook her head. \"Drat, I wish Walter had fixed this door before he died.\" She opened it with more caution. Stepping into the sunlight, she pressed both palms against her face at the sight of my mischievous offspring. \"Oh, there they are! The children. Sadie, aren\u0027t they precious?\"\n Paige was holding a fistful of foliage, root balls still attached, while Jordan was attempting to shove a grapefruit-sized rock into his tiny pocket. My children flinched as the dogs bounded over for more kissing.\n \"Lazy! Fatso! Behave yourselves!\" Dody clapped her hands and the dogs dolefully meandered away.\n \"Kids, come say hello to Aunt Dody.\"\n Paige trotted over immediately. \"Aunt Dody, I got you flowers!\"\n \"Paige! Mommy has told you not to pull things out of other people\u0027s gardens!\" I scolded.\n \"But you said it was all weeds in there.\"\n Dody squinted at me from the corner of her eye, then leaned forward to touch Paige\u0027s cheek, as if it were fragile as a bubble.\n \"You pick all the flowers you want, darling. That\u0027s what they\u0027re for.\" Dody took the impromptu bouquet, tapping the clumps of dirt against her silk-clad leg. \"These are simply lovely. And who is the tall fellow over there?\" Dody gestured toward Jordan. \"That can\u0027t be your baby brother.\"\n Jordan hesitated. He knew Dody, but he had become very shy since the divorce.\n \"I\u0027m not a baby,\" he grumbled.\n \"Of course you\u0027re not. Why, you\u0027re nearly tall enough to punch Jasper right in the kisser.\"\n My son\u0027s lips twitched as he fought to hide a smile.\n Jasper was Dody\u0027s oldest son and, at six foot four, by far the tallest in the family. He had recently graduated from cooking school but was quick to inform people it was called the Institute of Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management.\n \"Did you know Jasper got a new job at Arno\u0027s! Swankiest restaurant in Bell Harbor, thank you very much. He can tell you all about it. Jasper!\" she hollered over her shoulder.\n \"Is he here?\" I asked.\n \"Oh, yes. Didn\u0027t I tell you? He moved back home to save money to buy a restaurant.\"\n My brain pinged in alarm. She knew perfectly well she hadn\u0027t told me, because if she had, I might not have come. She knew I wanted a man-free zone for my summer vacation. If Jasper was there, I\u0027d have to share a bathroom with his whiskers and his toilet seat neglect. He\u0027d fart at random and blame it on the dogs. And I\u0027d have to wear a bra all the time! What the hell kind of vacation was this going to be? My trepidation over coming resurfaced.\n It hadn\u0027t been an easy decision to pull the kids away from everything familiar. Any extended visit with Dody had the potential for mayhem. So did most short visits. But the tipping point came when Richard forbid us to go. The passive-aggressive glee I got from telling him he couldn\u0027t stop me was worth having to put up with Jasper.\n I walked over to my SUV and opened the back to unload. It was loaded to the brim. I was a notorious overpacker and brought everything we could possibly need for the summer - and several things we wouldn\u0027t. I liked to plan for every potential contingency. You just never knew when you\u0027d get stranded in a remote place and need a ball of twine or rubber cement. Richard always teased me, but he had no idea how much of my effort went into making sure his vacation ran smoothly.\n Dody turned to my children. \"Darlings, there are toys for you in the kitchen. It\u0027s mostly old junk from my friend Anita Parker. She just cleaned her attic.\"\n Paige and Jordan squeaked and immediately ran inside. The promise of toys, even crappy old toys from some stranger\u0027s attic, was enough to get Jordan over his shyness.\n Dody turned back to me. \"Anita\u0027s bird died. Did I tell you that? What a tragedy.\" She lowered her voice in solemnity. \"Gobbled up by her own cat! Can you imagine?\"\n \"You mean the bird that bit me when I was little?\" I was terrified of that bird.\n Dody nodded. \"Probably.\" She hugged me again. \"Oh, I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re finally here! Three years is too long.\"\n I reached out from her embrace and tugged on another suitcase.\n \"It hasn\u0027t been so very long, Dody.\"\n \"Pish-posh. Those times you stayed at a hotel don\u0027t count.\" She brushed a strand of hair from my cheek, as if I were three instead of thirty.\n \"We didn\u0027t stay here because Richard was allergic to the dogs.\"\n \"Bullshit. He just didn\u0027t like me.\"\n I didn\u0027t argue. She was right. Richard thought Dody was rude and invasive and that her house always smelled like cabbage and patchouli. Which it does.\n Deliberately moving on, I said, \"I signed the divorce papers last week.\"\n \"You did? Thank goodness!\"\n I received another effusive embrace.\n \"I never liked him either, you know.\" Dody wiped her hands together as if her memory of him were a greasy smudge. \"Now that\u0027s over and done with, we can find you a better man.\"\n I jerked out another suitcase and nearly slugged her with it. \"Why would I want another man?\"\n Her expression of bewilderment suggested I\u0027d just turned down chocolate cake. \"Because, silly, you can\u0027t stay single forever.\"\n I dropped the luggage with a thud into the dirt of the driveway.\n \"Technically, I\u0027ve been divorced for five days, Dody. Uncle Walter died six years ago and you\u0027re still single.\"\n \"But you\u0027ve been alone for over a year now. And I\u0027m playing the field. As a matter of fact, I met a simply delightful man just the other day. Didn\u0027t I tell you? We met at the shooting range.\"\n \"The shooting range? What were you doing at the shooting range?\"\n \"Target practice, silly. You shouldn\u0027t own a gun if you don\u0027t know how to use it.\"\n I nearly slammed my hand in the trunk.\n \"Use it? When did you get a gun?\"\n This was not good news. My aunt wasn\u0027t responsible enough to own a squirt gun, much less something with real bullets.\n \"A few weeks ago. We have that skunk, you know.\"\n \"What skunk?\"\n \"The one who keeps getting in our trash. Last week he sprayed Lazyboy right in the face.\"\n \"So you\u0027re going to shoot him?\"\n \"Of course not!\" She reached down and picked up the smallest suitcase. \"I\u0027ll shoot over his head to scare him away. Anyway, his name is Harry.\"\n \"You named the skunk Harry?\"\n She looked at me as though I was the one talking crazy. \"Why would I name the skunk Harry? That\u0027s ridiculous. Harry is the man I met. He\u0027s a dentist. Lovely teeth, I must say. And his granddaughter works at the new Starbursts.\"\n \"Starbursts?\"\n \"Yes, the coffee place.\"\n \"Oh, you mean Starbucks.\"\n \"Yes, that\u0027s the one. I love those Ralph Macchios, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"She means macchiato,\" said Jasper, coming out from the house at last. He gave me a fast hug then scooped up several suitcases. \"Welcome to Casa de Loco.\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n My cousin hadn\u0027t changed much since the last time I\u0027d seen him. Taller, skinnier, if that was possible, but still a boyish version of my aunt, with curly blond hair and light blue eyes. And he wasn\u0027t particularly hairy. Maybe he wouldn\u0027t leave too many whiskers in the bathroom.\n \"Anyway,\" Dody said, \"Harry is Italian. He has a mustache, like the Italians. And there\u0027s the gun too, of course. But do you know the very best part?\" She gave a girlish giggle. \"He looks just like Dr. Phil!\"\n Seriously? That was the best part?\n \"I met him, you know, Dr. Phil,\" she went on as Jasper and I carried my stuff into the house. \"At a taping of his show. He told me my scarf was very unique. It was the one Walter got me at Fort Knox. You know, the one that looks like a giant hundred dollar bill? Anyway, that Dr. Phil was the most charming man ever, even if he was staring at my bosoms.\" She straightened her shoulders. \"Walter always did say I have an impressive rack.\"\n \"God, mother,\" Jasper winced.\n \"What? I do.\"\n \"What took you so long, Mommy?\" Paige demanded when I finally joined them on the beach later that evening. Jasper had gathered some chairs in a semicircle so we could watch the sunset near the water. He and Dody were there, waiting with the kids.\n \"I was putting things away,\" I said.\n She put her hands on her hips and frowned. \"You\u0027re always putting things away!\"\n \"Darling, would you and Jordan find me some bird feathers?\" Dody interrupted. \"If you do, I\u0027ll make you each a dream catcher.\"\n Paige nodded and skipped away, pulling Jordan with her.\n Jasper gestured to a beach chair. \"Have a seat. Want a beer?\" He reached into the red cooler sitting next to him in the sand.\n I couldn\u0027t recall the last time I\u0027d had a beer. The women of Glenville didn\u0027t drink beer. They sipped expensive chardonnay from delicately stemmed goblets. Of course, most of them polished off the entire bottle in one sitting to wash down their Prozac. And by them, I mean me.\n But I was officially on vacation. Time to kick back and relax. \"Sure, I would love a beer. Thanks.\"\n No sooner had I taken the bottle from one cousin\u0027s hand when the unmistakable melody of my other cousin rang out.\n \"Free at last, baby girl! You are free at last!\"\n Fontaine, Dody\u0027s younger son, galloped down the deck steps two at a time, his lime-green shirt unbuttoned and flapping in the breeze. His dark hair was artfully gelled into place and he sported a dashing new goatee. He kissed the air next to my ear. \"You look fab, Sades. Broken heart agrees with you.\"\n \"Thanks, Fontaine. You don\u0027t look too shabby yourself.\"\n He smiled, flashing unnaturally bright teeth, and flexed a slender bicep. \"I know, right? I\u0027ve been doing yoga with Mom.\"\n Jasper choked on his beer. \"It\u0027s revolting to watch.\"\n Fontaine twitched a dark brow. \"You\u0027re just jealous because I\u0027m so bendy.\"\n \"Right. If I ever need to stick my head up my own ass, maybe I\u0027ll join you. Here\u0027s a beer.\" He tossed it to Fontaine, who caught it with a flourish.\n \"Boys, play nice,\" Dody said, extending her leg and wiggling her foot. \"Fontaine, do you love my new flip-flops? I got them for a steal at the dollar store. They were a dollar.\"\n \"What are the odds?\" Jasper mumbled, immune to the thrill of finding cute, cheap shoes.\n \"Sparkly, Mom. Good find.\" Fontaine plopped down into a beach chair and I did the same.\n The sun glowed orange, casting light and shadows across the sand. It was nearly time to tuck my kids into bed, but Paige was giggling, tossing feathers into the air and watching them float downward. Jordan was poking at a dried clump of seaweed with a driftwood stick. Maybe just this once they could stay up late. Tomorrow we could establish our bedtime routine.\n \"Fontaine, tell Sadie about your magazine interview,\" Dody said. Then she turned to me. \"He was interviewed for a magazine, Sadie. Isn\u0027t that exciting? It\u0027s all about his new interior design job and how everybody is doing fong shewy.\"\n \"It was a blurb, Mom.\" Fontaine sipped his beer.\n \"Nonetheless, it was very flattering.\" She dabbed moisture from her eyes. \"You\u0027ve got your fancy decorating job, and Jasper works at such a nice restaurant and has a beautiful girlfriend. You are both doing so well.\" Her voice caught with emotion. \"Walter and I are so proud of you.\"\n \"Have you been talking to Dad again?\" Jasper\u0027s tone was as dry as the sand.\n \"Not directly, of course. But my spiritual advisor has. She\u0027s very wise.\" Dody lifted her foot again, admiring how the sun reflected off the sparkles of her one-dollar flip-flop.\n \"Wise enough to swipe your money and tell you gibberish. If she\u0027s so good at communicating with Dad, ask him where he left the good rake.\"\n \"He can\u0027t be bothered with such trivial, earthbound questions,\" she answered.\n \"Why? It\u0027s not like he has someplace else to be,\" Jasper responded.\n \"Oh, phooey. I\u0027m not discussing this with you anymore. Sadie, ask Fontaine about his magazine article. Oh, and the renovations at his house. That\u0027s why he\u0027s staying with us for a few weeks, you know.\"\n I spilled beer on the front of my shirt. \"You\u0027re staying here too?\" Damn! How many men was I going to have to put up with during this visit?\n \"I\u0027m moving a few walls. But the drywall dust is hell on my nasal passages. Besides, you\u0027ll have way more fun with me here. You can\u0027t just sit around all day with my mom.\"\n Au, contraire! That is exactly what I planned to do. A big, fat nothing! I wanted to lie on the beach for hours, play checkers with my kids, watch mindless television, and give up all personal grooming habits. I was here to escape from men, but my visions of a perfectly estrogen-driven summer vacation were vanishing faster than the polar ice caps. Sure, Fontaine was fun, like cotton candy is fun. But it\u0027s also sickeningly sweet and too much gives me a splitting headache. Just like Fontaine.\n I forced a smile. \"That\u0027s great. We\u0027ll have a blast.\"\n I looked back over the water and gulped down my beer. This wasn\u0027t at all what I had planned. But then again, what in my life was turning out the way I expected?\n Fontaine tapped his elbow against mine. \"So, sugarplum, aside from the total collapse of your marriage, what else is new?\"\n He was as blunt as he was fashion conscious, which is to say, very.\n \"Not much. Richard is still mad I got the house. My mother is still mad I got divorced while my sister is mad I didn\u0027t dump him sooner. And I\u0027m thinking about cutting my hair. How about you?\"\n He nodded. \"Yes, I definitely think you should cut your hair.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I meant. Hey, wait a minute! You said I looked fabulous.\"\n He was already getting on my nerves.\n \"You do, mostly. But your hair shows hints of giving up. We\u0027ll have to do better since you\u0027re back on the market.\"\n I sat forward in my chair so abruptly a flock of nearby seagulls launched into flight. \"I am not on the market!\"\n \"Of course you are.\" He set his empty bottle in the sand.\n \"That\u0027s what I said!\" Dody nodded emphatically.\n \"I am not.\" I shook my head, equally emphatic.\n \"Don\u0027t even bother, Sadie.\" Jasper chuckled. \"You\u0027re their summer project. Didn\u0027t you know?\"\n \"Pish-posh, Jasper. Shush yourself,\" Dody hissed.\n \"Is that why you invited me here?\" A wave of nausea rolled over me and the back of my neck prickled like heat rash. I should have known my aunt\u0027s insistent invitation cloaked an ulterior motive. She wasn\u0027t president of the Bell Harbor Busybody Association for nothing.\n \"Don\u0027t listen to him, darling,\" Dody assured me. \"We just want to nurture you and mend your broken spirit.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have a broken spirit!\"\n Fontaine and his mother exchanged a look. One that said She\u0027s so pathetic she doesn\u0027t even realize how pathetic she is.\n \"Seriously. I\u0027m fine. I just need a little vacation.\"\n \"Don\u0027t get your knickers in a twist, kitty cat.\" Fontaine sighed. \"We just want you to have a little fun, you know.\"\n \"Yeah, well, fun for me does not involve men.\"\n \"But darling,\" Dody chided gently, \"you can\u0027t fight against the universal balance. Without the despair of today we can\u0027t experience the joy of tomorrow.\"\n \"Did Dr. Phil tell you that?\" Jasper asked, draining the last of his beer before reaching into the cooler and taking another.\n She shook her head. \"Not Dr. Phil. Kung Fu Panda. But nonetheless, Sadie can\u0027t let one bad apple sour her on romance.\"\n \"Romance?\" Fontaine snorted, crossing his arms behind his head and stretching. \"Who\u0027s talking about romance? I\u0027m talking about crazy, rowdy sex. Like...with him.\" He nodded toward the shoreline.\n Jogging along the water\u0027s edge was a man. Quite a man, in fact. Tanned, tall, muscular, and sweaty. The type of man who knew how the sun bounced off the waves and flickered over his gleaming muscles. Vain bastard. He was exactly the kind I wanted to avoid, with his long, stupid legs and his dumb, broad shoulders. He might as well have unfaithful tattooed right on that bulging bicep I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off of. Damn.\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" I whispered, sounding significantly breathier than intended. Did I mention he was sweaty?\n Fontaine smiled. \"I don\u0027t know. I just call him Running Man.\"\n Running Man continued on, giving an awkward wave as Dody, Fontaine, and I continued to stare and Jasper picked at the label of his beer.\n \"Hey, Fontaine!\" Paige scampered up, breaking our collective trance.\n \"Hey, sweet stuff! Give me some sugar.\" He pulled her close for a kiss on the cheek.\n My daughter adored Fontaine, thanks in no small part to their shared appreciation of all things glittery.\n \"It scratches,\" she said, reaching up and tapping his goatee. \"Why is that on your face?\"\n Fontaine laughed. \"That\u0027s called style, girlfriend. It\u0027s what sets us apart from the animals. And the rednecks.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-1.html","bookId":2788,"book":{"id":2788,"title":"Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1) \n If Sadie Turner is good at anything, it\u0027s putting stuff in order.
