{"id":89162,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I STRUGGLED TO GET THE brush through Paige\u0027s hair. It was knotted and crusty and smelled suspiciously like raspberries. The kids and I were in the kitchen with Dody while she made her morning cauldron of gloppy oatmeal. \"Ouch,\" Paige complained. When the phone rang she jumped away. \"My turn! I\u0027ll get it.\" She picked up the receiver. \"Hello? Aunt Dody\u0027s house.\" After a minute, she giggled. \"No, silly. Princesses don\u0027t answer the phone. I\u0027m Paige.\" She paused again, one hand on her hip, the other holding the phone to her ear. I was struck with a vision of my future teenage daughter. Paige nodded. \"Yes, she\u0027s brushing my hair, but she\u0027s not being nice about it at all. Just because I dipped it in yogurt.\" \"Is that what that is?\" I said. No wonder it was such a mess. Paige giggled again. \"No, it tasted the same. OK, I will.\" Then she handed the phone to me. \"Des wants to talk to you.\" There went that annoying and persistent buzz of anticipation again. That must be what the Highlander feels whenever another immortal shows up. \"Hello?\" I tried to sound skinny. \"Sadie? Hi, it\u0027s Des.\" \"Hi.\" Dody stopped stirring to blatantly eavesdrop. \"Hey, sorry to bother you, but I\u0027m in a bit of a bind. I wondered if you could help me out.\" Dear God, please, please, make him need help taking off his pants. \"What do you need?\" \"I\u0027m waiting on a package that\u0027s supposed to arrive by ten, but I just got called in early to work. Is there any chance you could come down here and sign for it?\" That sounded easy. And platonic. \"Sure. I can do that.\" I heard a sigh of relief from his side. \"Really? Fantastic! Thank you.\" \"No problem. Should I come right now?\" \"If you could. Sorry to mess up your morning.\" \"Oh, I think my social obligations can wait. I\u0027ll be there in five minutes.\" Realistically I needed twenty to sufficiently beautify, but what would be the point of that? We were ships passing in the night anyway. Dody clapped her hands together as I hung up the phone. \"Oh, my!\" I held up my hand to silence her. \"Dody, he just needs somebody there to sign for a package. Don\u0027t make a big deal out of it. It\u0027s just a neighborly favor.\" She crossed her arms. \"Alberta Schmidt lives right next door to the Pullmans\u0027. Why didn\u0027t he ask her to do it? She\u0027s closer.\" \"Probably because we owe him, like, ten favors already. And because she smells like bad cheese.\" \"She is a little gassy,\" Dody admitted. \"Ukrainian, you know.\" I had no idea what that meant, but didn\u0027t have time to get into it. I had five minutes to splash water on my face and find an outfit that displayed casual sophistication while hinting at dormant sensuality. Even a ship in the night wants to look good. Fifteen minutes later, Des greeted me at his front door. \"Thanks so much for doing this,\" he said. \"I really have to run. Just lock the door when you leave. There\u0027s coffee, if you want some.\" He pointed over at the counter with one hand and scooped up his keys with the other. \"If the package isn\u0027t here by ten and you have to leave, don\u0027t worry about it.\" \"No, I\u0027m good. Dody\u0027s got the kids.\" We stood at the front door like a little old married couple, with him heading off to work while I stayed home to clean the house and drink vodka from a coffee cup. I half expected him to kiss my cheek. But he only smiled and left, waving from the driver\u0027s seat of his sporty convertible and zipping away to his glamorous job saving lives. I shut the door and leaned back against it. Wait a second. I was alone in Dr. Desmond McKnight\u0027s house. Well, shit. I had free rein to snoop to my heart\u0027s content. He\u0027d never know. Oh, where to start? The bedroom? The bathroom? The family room? I stepped into the living room and felt a queasy rush to my stomach. I paused and turned toward the bedroom, feeling another roll of unease. I waited. Technically going through his stuff was a) unethical; b) unwise; c) inevitable; or d) all of the above. This situation required a second opinion. I pulled the phone from my pocket and called Penny. \"Hey,\" she answered. \"Hey, guess where I am?\" A quiver of adrenaline squeaked in my voice. \"Um, the secretary of state\u0027s office?\" I stomped a foot. \"No! Why would I call you from the secretary of state\u0027s office?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Why do you always call me from Dody\u0027s pantry?\" \"Because it\u0027s the only place no one ever looks for me.\" It was also because I loved gazing at the pristine splendor of the newly labeled shelves and alphabetized canned goods. \"Anyway, I\u0027m at Des\u0027s. He asked me to wait here for a package because he had to go to work.\" \"Interesting.\" I waited, knowing Penny\u0027s mind would travel the same yellow-brick road as mine. \"So, what have you learned, Dorothy?\" \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m calling. I\u0027ve had an attack of conscience. Do I look around or mind my own business?\" \"Oh, please! You have to look around!\" \"But what if I find something awful? Like kiddie porn or a Josh Groban poster.\" \"Shut up. I love Josh Groban.\" I rolled my eyes, even though she couldn\u0027t see me. \"Focus, Penny. What should I do?\" \"At least look in the bedroom to see how messy he is.\" That seemed like an acceptable option. The master bedroom was on the first floor, so it wasn\u0027t as if I was really snooping. Not if I didn\u0027t go upstairs. I peeked in from the doorway, feeling nervous, as if I had Des whispering into my ear instead of Penny. The bedroom was nondescript, full of the Pullmans\u0027 very traditional furniture. The bed itself was half-made, with a champagne-colored spread pulled up but not tucked in at the top. I could see the slight indentation on one pillow where Des\u0027s head must have been. I felt an insatiable urge to run my fingers over the spot or maybe slip my hand between the sheets to feel his warmth. I swallowed the sudden lump in my throat. \"Penny, I don\u0027t think I should go in his room.\" \"What\u0027s the matter, Colonel Sanders? Chicken?\" \"No. It just seems wrong somehow.\" \"Why? Because it\u0027s calculating and invasive?\" \"I love that you realize that and yet still encourage me to do it. You are a terrible sister.\" She laughed into the phone. \"Why do you call me with your own bad ideas and then judge me for supporting you?\" \"Sorry. I guess this just bothers me because it\u0027s what I used to do to Richard, you know? Go through all his pockets looking for receipts and condom wrappers.\" \"Yeah, but what difference does it make what you find at that house? Unless you come across some kinky gizmo in the goodie drawer.\" \"Ick! I am so not looking in Joanna Pullman\u0027s goodie drawer. I don\u0027t care about their junk. I\u0027m interested in his junk. Wait, that came out wrong.\" \"Uh, like Freudian wrong.\" Penny laughed. \"Anyway, I still don\u0027t see what difference it makes what you find. Unless...are you starting to like this guy?\" My sister\u0027s voice lifted. \"No,\" I said, sounding as defiant as Jordan when I tell him it\u0027s bedtime. Penny laughed again. \"It\u0027s OK to like him, you big coward. Maybe he\u0027s one of the good ones. Like Jeff. There are a few of them out there. And you deserve somebody awesome, especially after what The Dick put you through.\" \"But what if this guy is as much a jerk as Richard was?\" \"If he is, then tell him to go fuck himself because you can find somebody better. You really can, Sadie. I\u0027m not making this up to make you feel better. Dick was a cheating shmuck, but you\u0027re still acting like the divorce was your failure. It wasn\u0027t. And if you like this guy, hell, even if you don\u0027t, you should go for it.\" \"But that\u0027s no good. Eventually he\u0027ll get assigned someplace else, and I\u0027ll be back to Glenville in September. We\u0027d be breaking up as soon as we got started.\" \"So you\u0027re not even going to try? Honestly! Is there a mirror in that house?\" \"What?\" \"A mirror. Find a mirror and stand in front of it.\" God, my sister was pushy. I stepped inside the master bedroom and planted myself near the mirror over the bureau. \"OK, Miss Bossy-Pants. Now what?\" \"Now say, \u0027I am fabulous.\u0027\" I laughed in spite of myself. \"You sound like Fontaine. Now he\u0027s fabulous.\" \"Stop trying to change the subject, Sadie. I\u0027m doing an intervention here.\" Big sigh. I looked into the mirror at my frazzled self. There was a nice, rosy glow to my cheeks. And I had a little tan going on. And come to think of it, my hair was sort of pretty. \"I am fabulous,\" I murmured into the phone. \"Louder, and less sarcastic.\" \"I am fabulous.\" \"Good,\" Penny said. \"Now say this. I deserve a really great guy because I\u0027m good enough, I\u0027m smart enough, and, darn it, people like me.\" I burst out laughing. \"Isn\u0027t that what Al Franken used to say when he was a comedian instead of a politician?\" \"Isn\u0027t that the same thing? Anyway, say it.\" I shook my head, still laughing. \"Look, I get where you\u0027re going with this, Penn, and I appreciate it. I really do. I hear you, and I\u0027ll think about it. OK?\" \"Promise?\" \"Yes! Geez, I only called so you\u0027d absolve me of guilt for going through his stuff. What a pain you are.\" \"I\u0027m your sister. That\u0027s my job. And speaking of job, I\u0027m really sorry, but I have to get back to work. Call me later and tell me what you find, deal?\" \"Deal.\" I slipped the phone back in my pocket and stared at myself for another moment. I wasn\u0027t half bad looking. OK, if I was totally honest, I was pretty OK looking. I\u0027d held up. One nice byproduct of Richard\u0027s cheating had been my nearly psychotic drive to stay in shape, thinking I could cardio-boot-camp my way into a secure marriage. I couldn\u0027t, of course. But I sure as hell could\u0027ve kicked the redhead\u0027s ass in a street fight. Well, not a street fight because I was too ladylike for that. But I bet I could run faster than her. In the mirror, the reflection of Des\u0027s half-made bed caught my eye. That enticing pillow dent was calling. I kind of wanted to smell it. But that would be weird, right? Bitchy the cat sashayed past me from whereabouts unknown to jump onto the bed. She lay down right in the center, glaring at me. Then just to prove how her derision of me knew no boundaries, she pointed one hind leg at the ceiling and proceeded to lick herself. I glared at her, hoping to make her bashful, but she was one bold ho. Giving up, I turned to leave the room, and the doorbell rang, startling me. I\u0027d forgotten all about the package. I ran to the door and yanked it open, accidentally smacking it against the table in the foyer. A chubby, unshaven delivery man in a mustard-colored shirt about three sizes too small greeted me. He was holding a big envelope and a clipboard. \"Hello,\" he said, squinting at the clipboard and running a thick, stubby finger down the list. \"I have a package for...a Mr. Delmondo McNaught?\" \"Desmond McKnight?\" I asked. He pushed his glasses against the bridge of his nose. \"Close enough.\" He handed me the board and a sticky pen. How to sign this? Should I put Des\u0027s name or mine? I decided to go with his, partly because I had yet to outgrow that schoolgirl thrill of doodling a cute boy\u0027s name. And also because if I inadvertently authorized a delivery for some nefarious mobster named Delmondo McNaught, I didn\u0027t want anyone to trace it back to me. \"Thank you, Mrs. McKnight,\" the delivery man said. He turned and waddled back to his truck. Mrs. McKnight? My, my, didn\u0027t that have a lovely ring to it? I stepped back, and the door bumped against the table again. I pondered that for a minute, finally deciding to be outrageously presumptuous and move the table to the other wall. Maybe Des wouldn\u0027t even notice. Most men didn\u0027t pay attention to things like that. Then I set the envelope down on the relocated table. My work here was done. Still, I wasn\u0027t quite ready to leave. I liked being inside his space, even though it clamored loudly of the Pullmans\u0027 presence. I wandered through the living room, sitting on the suede L-shaped sofa, reveling in the cush factor. I imagined, for one secret moment, reclining on the sofa with Des next to me. Bitchy came out from the bedroom, thoroughly washed. I sensed what was going on in her little feline mind. She wanted me out of there. She was going to take kitten chow pellets and spell out a message on the floor for Des. It would say, \"Weird neighbor lady stayed all morning. I hate her.\" Cats are so vindictive. \"Come on, baby. Let Mommy get your jammies on, please?\" I was tired. I wanted to get my kids through with their baths and into bed. Paige was in her nightgown but Jordan was wiggling in front of me while I tried to dry him off. Somehow I always ended up the wettest during their bath time. Murmured voices floated up from downstairs. Kyle was coming by to pick up Fontaine for some interior-designer event. Dody had a date with a man from her scuba-diving class since Harry was away visiting his grandson, and Jasper had a date with Beth, who had finally returned from her lengthy business trip. It would be a full house for a while, but soon they\u0027d all go on their way, and then I could get the kids to bed and have a little peace and quiet. The hardest things to tolerate at Dody\u0027s place (besides the awful decor, lousy mattresses, and obnoxious dogs) were the complete lack of privacy and the constant noise. Either Dody and her friends were practicing tai chi on the deck or Fontaine was in my face pestering me about something. Or Jasper was clanging pots around in the kitchen. It was always something. The times I\u0027d taken the kids to visit Richard in Glenville, I stayed at my own house and reveled in the silence. I didn\u0027t even mind that none of my neighbors were ever available to get together during those weekends because I craved the solitude. So tonight, I wanted to relax in lovely aloneness. \"Mommy, can we go downstairs and say good night to Aunt Dody?\" Paige asked. I hesitated. The bedtime process with my kids was often long and arduous, with lots of good-night kisses and books to read and pleasant dreams to be wished upon. But Paige turned her big, sweet eyes on me, and I gave in. \"Sure, but let\u0027s make it quick.\" She and Jordan scampered down the stairs and I followed. \"Hi, Des!\" I heard Paige exclaim. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I came to say thanks to your mum. Did you get the yogurt out of your hair?\" Had I been a half step farther behind I could\u0027ve turned around and snuck back to my room to change clothes, or at least brush my hair. But destiny, as usual, had other plans. When I heard Des\u0027s voice, my wet foot slipped on the step and I tumbled ass over teacup and landed with a thud at the bottom of the staircase. Birds chirped in little circles around my head, and strong arms helped me upright. I must have been hallucinating. The fog cleared, and everyone\u0027s face came into focus, with Des\u0027s the closest to mine. \"Are you OK?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m OK. I just slipped.\" \"I hope you won the contest,\" said Fontaine. \"What contest?\" I was still a bit off balance. \"The wet T-shirt contest.\" I looked down. My white tank top, completely soaked with bath water, was virtually transparent. Adding insult to my injury, I was wearing the bra Penny bought me as a joke. The one decorated with little red ladybugs in an attempt to help me overcome my irrational fear of little red ladybugs. Chuckles rippled around the room. I plucked the fabric away from my skin, triggering a questionable suction sound. It\u0027s not as if it was the first time I\u0027d made a fool of myself. Not likely the last, either. \"Are you sure you\u0027re OK? Can you stand up?\" Des\u0027s hands were still on my arm, and I let him help me to my feet. Mustering as much dignity as the occasion allowed, I said, \"I just need to change my shirt.\" I came back downstairs in the most opaque T-shirt I could find. Everyone had moved outside to have drinks on the deck. Des was leaning against the rail, a beer in his hand. Fontaine and Kyle were next to him. The gorgeous blonde next to Jasper must be Beth. And the stout, flush-faced man next to Dody must be her date. \"I\u0027m back,\" I announced, mostly to warn them to stop talking about me. \"Here she is,\" Dody said, clapping her hands. \"Bud, this is my niece, Sadie. Sadie, this is my friend, Bud Light.\" He flicked a toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other. \"Bud Wright,\" he corrected. I shook Mr. Wright\u0027s meaty hand. \"Nice to meet you, Bud.\" He looked me over. \"You the divorcee?\" I had little choice but to say, \"Yes.\" He nodded. \"Sounds like you did the right thing.\" Discussing the failure of my marriage with this complete stranger fell low on my list of desires. I certainly wasn\u0027t going to pursue the topic in front of Kyle or Beth. And certainly not in front of Des! I tossed a pleading glance in Fontaine\u0027s direction. Help me, please! He picked up on my SOS. \"Um, hey, Sade,\" he said, turning his back, \"do these jeans give me a Ken-doll butt?\" Not quite the rescue I was looking for, but good enough. Jasper stepped in front of him, tugging his girlfriend by the wrist. \"Sadie, this is Beth.\" Thank goodness! A useful distraction. \"Beth! It\u0027s great to finally meet you. Jasper has told me so many wonderful things.\" I hugged her with too much enthusiasm, my voice going dolphin squeaky. Guilt over my less-than-thrilled response to Jasper\u0027s talk of marriage was foremost in my mind, with my tumble down the steps pushing hard from second place. \"It\u0027s great to meet you too. Your children are adorable.\" \"Thank you. That\u0027s sweet of you to say. And that reminds me, kids, time for bed!\" I looked around and saw them scurry from the living room into the kitchen and try to hide behind Dody\u0027s row of aprons hanging from the wall. \"Sadie, dear, I\u0027ll tuck them in for you. You don\u0027t mind waiting a few more minutes, do you, Bud?\" Dody asked. He held up his nearly empty glass. \"Not if somebody will freshen this drink. But don\u0027t take too long, Do. I\u0027m so hungry I could eat the ass end of a baby.\" Dody\u0027s Mr. Wright had a colorful way about him. \"Come along, kids,\" Dody said, herding them from the kitchen to the stairs. She caught my eye and tipped her head in Des\u0027s direction. Subtle as a brick to the skull, that old lady was. \"I\u0027ll freshen that,\" Fontaine said to Bud, taking the glass from his hand. \"How about you, Des? Need another beer?\" \"Sure.\" Paige darted away from Dody and ran to Des, flinging her arms around his waist, coming perilously close to boy parts I didn\u0027t want her near until she was at least thirty-five. \"Good night, Des.\" He ruffled her hair. \"Night, Paige. See you soon.\" Jordan approached as well, handing Des two action figures. \"Here. You can play with these if you want to.\" Des looked them over and offered my son a solemn fist bump. \"Thanks, man. I\u0027ll be careful with them.\" Jordan nodded. My heart went ping. And then pong. Jordan did not trust easily. And he never shared his action figures, not even with me. As glad as I was to see it, I wasn\u0027t completely comfortable with it either. What if Des started to mean something to Jordan? I could protect myself from getting hurt, but my son\u0027s feelings were another thing entirely. I needed to be clear to everyone present I was not interested in this man. I must show them all how impervious I was to Des\u0027s charm. Because I was, you know, impervious. In fact, I hardly noticed how the blue of his shirt made his eyes turn a mystical shade of grayish green or that his nose was a little sunburned. I hadn\u0027t noticed his haircut either. But if I had, I might have thought that shorter hair made his ears seem a bit too big. Yes, it\u0027s true. He wasn\u0027t so perfect. Those were some damn big ears. But then he caught me staring and smiled, from ear to damn big ear, making me feel as vulnerable and exposed as I had been wearing the wet tank top. Why was he even here, really? Just to say thank you because I signed for some silly little package? He could have called on the phone for that. If I didn\u0027t know better, I would think he was flirting. And I didn\u0027t want him to. So what if Dody, Fontaine, and Penny all thought I should dive into his bed. It didn\u0027t cost them anything, tossing me into the treacherous sea of love with the albatross of loneliness strung around my neck. It wouldn\u0027t be their heart getting broken when he turned out to be just another jerky guy. Or secretly engaged to some nuclear-physicist brainiac who put herself through brainiac-physicist university by modeling lingerie in Paris. Fontaine came back to the deck, passing out drinks. He handed me something pink that looked harmless enough, but I knew better. He wanted me tipsy, just to see what might happen next. I was a notorious lightweight when it came to liquor. I could handle gallons of wine, but two shots of vodka and I was down for the count. Everyone took seats around the deck. Kyle and Fontaine sat with Bud on one side, Jasper and Beth sat on the other. Des settled on the wicker couch and smiled at me. He patted the spot next to him. Like Fontaine\u0027s drink, sitting next to Des was sure to be intoxicating. I was powerless to resist. He was obviously using Jedi mind control. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi! I took a gulp of Fontaine\u0027s love potion and sat down. \"Thanks for handling my package this morning,\" Des said without guile. \"What!\" Fontaine burst out. \"Sadie handled your package? Why the hell am I just hearing about this now?\" \"Shut up, Fontaine,\" I mumbled under the laughter. Des blushed, realizing what he\u0027d said. \"Sorry. That\u0027s not what I meant.\" We both took a drink. \"Hey, just out of curiosity,\" Des asked a second later, \"why did you move that table in the entryway?\" \"You noticed that, huh?\" \"Did you think I wouldn\u0027t?\" Richard wouldn\u0027t have noticed if I moved a couch. \"It was in the wrong place. The entryway is much more welcoming with the table where I put it. But you can put it back if you want to.\" \"I don\u0027t really care,\" he shrugged. \"I just wondered why you moved it.\" The sun sank lower, casting a magical gold coating over everything. A fresh breeze over the water cooled the hot deck, and the sound of waves was hypnotic. Fontaine\u0027s cocktails were taking effect, and a lovely, jovial mood enveloped us. Dody came back from putting the kids to bed, and she and Bud went on their way, leaving me with Des, Fontaine, Kyle, Jasper, and Beth. \"We could just get pizza and chill out here,\" Jasper said to Beth. \"Unless you want to go to that movie.\" She shook her head. \"It\u0027s too nice a night to be inside. Let\u0027s stay here.\" There went my evening of peace and solitude. Des\u0027s arm brushed against me, and suddenly a night alone didn\u0027t sound that fun anymore anyway. \"What do you think, Kyle? You want to stick around here too?\" Fontaine asked. Kyle looked at his drink. \"Will you make some more of these little devils?\" \"Sure.\" \"Then I\u0027m staying.\" And so it was. We ordered pizza and kept the drinks flowing. Beth turned out to be warm and funny and a perfect complement to Jasper\u0027s snappy commentary. I also began to suspect that Kyle had a crush on Fontaine. But then again, I\u0027d once thought Kyle was hitting on me, so maybe I just couldn\u0027t read him very well. Nonetheless, Kyle\u0027s sense of humor made me laugh until I snorted, a sound which I had never planned to share with Des. Someone decided we should take turns telling the worst jokes we knew, and whoever laughed had to take a drink. Trying not to laugh can make even the most moronic joke funny, so when Des asked, \"What did the Englishman say to the Scotsman?\" and then answered, \"Would it have kilt you to put on some pants?\" every one of us had to drink. \"We should play I Never,\" Jasper suggested once the joke game got old. \"What\u0027s that?\" Des asked. \"You\u0027ve never heard of I Never? Where did you go to college?\" Jasper demanded, amazed at this failure of our educational system. Des shrugged. \"Just...Massachusetts.\" \"Massachusetts? As in Harvard?\" Fontaine asked. Des scratched the back of his head, \"Yeah.\" Of course he went to Harvard. Where else would a sexy, shmexy, accent-talking doctor go? I heard the question in my head and wondered if it was Fontaine\u0027s drink talking. Anyway, what difference did it make if Des went to Harvard? It didn\u0027t matter if he went to college on the frickin\u0027 moon. I wasn\u0027t interested. \"Where\u0027d you go to medical school?\" Fontaine prodded. He just couldn\u0027t let it go. \"Still Harvard. I managed to not get kicked out. So how do you play this game?\" Des rubbed his hands together. I found myself smiling at him. He looked like a kid, all giddy about some silly game. This was a Harvard man, huh? Des was ever a surprise to me. I mean, in spite of the Ivy League college and his heartthrob good looks and the cool job, he seemed like one of us. He didn\u0027t constantly brag as Richard always had. In fact, Des never bragged at all. And he could have if he\u0027d wanted to. He had the goods. He had it all going on. An idea began to take hold in the base of my slightly tipsy mind. Maybe Des was one of the good ones Penny had told me about? \"It\u0027s pretty simple,\" Jasper explained, interrupting my thoughts. \"You say \u0027I never\u0027...and then you add something. Whoever has done whatever you said has to take a drink.\" \"It\u0027s a drinking game?\" Des asked. He sounded optimistic. \"Didn\u0027t you have drinking games at Harvard?\" \"Oh, we had lots of drinking games.\" \"Yes,\" said Fontaine, \"but they drank from snifters while wearing their ascots.\" Des shook his head. \"Hardly. Let\u0027s play.\" \"Let me check on my kids first. I can\u0027t have them overhearing this!\" Paige and Jordan were snug in their beds and loudly snoring, although I did have to remove a tiara from Paige\u0027s head and turn Jordan around 180 degrees. He liked to sleep with his feet on the pillow. I arrived back at the deck just as I heard the end of Jasper\u0027s joke. \"Rectum? Damn near killed him!\" I can only imagine how that one started. Our game began tamely enough, with Kyle saying, \"I\u0027ve never Googled my own name.\" He, Jasper, and Fontaine drank. \"Is there another Fontaine Baker out there?\" Beth asked. \"Nope. I\u0027m the one and only,\" Fontaine answered smugly. \"Yes, you are,\" Kyle added. \"Why would you Google your own name?\" She was still perplexed, or maybe the beverages were making her thickheaded. \"For fun,\" Kyle said. \"I found four other Kyle Tanners just in Michigan.\" \"But none like you.\" Fontaine patted his leg, and I started to wonder if there was monkey business going on with their design business. \"I\u0027ve never given anyone stitches,\" Jasper said. \"That\u0027s not fair,\" Des complained, but he took his drink anyway. Beth was next. \"I\u0027ve never stolen anything.\" Everyone but Beth took a drink. \"You\u0027ve never stolen anything? Not even a piece of candy?\" Kyle asked. Beth shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think so. The guilt would kill me.\" Jasper leaned over. \"Oh, but you\u0027ve stolen my heart.\" Everyone made retching sounds while Beth blushed and kissed Jasper\u0027s cheek. Then Fontaine said, \"I\u0027ve never ridden a unicycle.\" No one had. We went around the table a few times, saying things such as, \"I\u0027ve never painted myself blue...peed in the shower...gone to the movies alone...worn shoes from two different pairs.\" Then it was my turn again. \"I\u0027ve never driven on the opposite side of the road.\" Not a great one, but I was distracted by Des\u0027s big knees coming out of his shorts. Even his knees were cute, and nobody had cute knees. How did he manage that? He went next. \"I\u0027ve never...kissed a girl.\" Everyone drank except Fontaine. \"Oh, you have too, you cheater,\" I shouted at him. \"Remember Delores DeForrest?\" Des laughed the hardest, leaning forward toward Fontaine. \"You knew a girl named Delores DeForrest?\" \"Yes,\" Fontaine giggled. \"And she\u0027s a florist. Delores DeForrest the florist. Can you imagine?\" The drinks made us decidedly stupid. With each round our laughter grew louder and more obnoxious. Fontaine said, \"I\u0027ve never been to Scotland.\" Des slapped his own leg. \"Damn it, why are you picking on me?\" \"Because picking on Sadie is too easy,\" Fontaine answered. \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Just for that, I never manscaped my chest hair.\" \"Touche,\" Fontaine responded, picking up his drink. Then he added, \"I\u0027ve never had sex with a Highland sheep.\" \"Hah! Neither have I!\" Des exclaimed, but he got confused and took a drink anyway. Then he tripped himself up by saying, \"I\u0027ve never lived in another country. Oh, shit. That\u0027s me.\" I would have felt sorry for him except he was such a good sport about everyone making him drink. Plus he was getting completely hammered. Beth smiled sweetly and said, \"I\u0027ve never worn a kilt.\" Des sighed with exaggeration, picking up his glass once more. \"What\u0027s this game called again? Get the new guy drunk?\" \"Have you worn a kilt?\" I asked, not quite able to picture it. Sexy and Scottish as he was, I couldn\u0027t see him pulling off the whole Braveheart look, even with the cute knees. \"Not often. I wore one in my cousin\u0027s wedding. Apparently...\" He paused a second, pointing his finger at no one in particular as laughter overtook him. \"Apparently you have to be more careful...how you sit...in a kilt.\" \"Show off a little Loch Ness monster there, aye, Des?\" Jasper asked. Des nodded fast. \"Nearly.\" We howled with laughter. Then Fontaine, being his diabolically provocative self, said, \"I\u0027ve never had a sexual fantasy about anyone on this deck!\" A collective snicker went round the table. Jasper and Beth smiled at each other and toasted, clinking their glasses together. Then suddenly everyone was looking at me! What the hell? Curse you, Fontaine! He knew I had tawdry visions of Des tucked away in my mind, but I wasn\u0027t about to own up to it. If I didn\u0027t drink, would he call me out? Fontaine was a bully that way. I made a face at him, but he just waggled his eyebrows and nudged the glass closer to my hand. I sat motionless, still as a statue, resisting the urge to cross my arms. I was not confessing to this one. Then to the left of me, Des let out a little snort. He picked up his glass, drained the whole of it, and thumped it back down on the table with defiance. The others doubled over with raucous laughter while my mind whirled out of control. Was he fantasizing about me? He couldn\u0027t be. Oh Lord, this was embarrassing! I bit my lip. Seconds passed, until finally I peeked over at Des. He was grinning at me like a kid holding the last ice-cream cone available to mankind. He was daring me, that arrogant bastard. What were we, twelve? Oh, what the hell. With pinky raised, I took a genteel sip from my glass, daintily dabbed at the corners of my mouth, and then threw the glass over my shoulder and right off the deck. By this time, they could hear us laughing in Wisconsin.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-9.html","bookId":2788,"book":{"id":2788,"title":"Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1)","description":"Storyline: Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1) If Sadie Turner is good at anything, it\u0027s putting stuff in order. So when she finds her \"perfect\" life in disarray, she hopes a summer vacation at her aunt\u0027s lake house will help her piece it back together.
