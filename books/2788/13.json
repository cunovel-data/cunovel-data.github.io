{"id":89166,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"SINCE INSTITUTING MY EXPERT ORGANIZATIONAL design in Dody\u0027s kitchen, putting away the dishes was a snap. Now if only I could get them to adhere to my refrigerator-shelf-labeling system, life would be even easier. But it almost seemed as if they didn\u0027t care. I scolded Fontaine as he set a jar of Dijon mustard next to a carton of free-range, grain-fed, self-actualized chicken eggs. \"Hey! Look!\" I tapped hard on the correctly label shelf. \"It says right here: condiments. Mustard is a condiment.\" He scratched the side of his nose with his middle finger. \"Do the words OCD mean anything to you?\" \"Those are letters, not words. And you\u0027re the one who told me to organize.\" \"I had no idea what a field of land mines that would create.\" \"Just put the mustard where it belongs and nobody gets hurt, OK?\" \"On one condition. You have to call Des.\" \"That\u0027s extortion.\" \"Extortion. Persuasion. Whatever. He probably thinks you\u0027re mad at him.\" Fontaine set a jar of pickles next to the soy milk just to piss me off. I moved the pickles to the pickle shelf. \"I am mad. It was humiliating. God, Fontaine. It was like he couldn\u0027t remember my name.\" \"Maybe he was protecting you. Like, maybe she\u0027s some crazy stalker who\u0027d come after you with a machete.\" \"Spaghetti? Who\u0027s having spaghetti? We just ate,\" Dody asked, wandering in from the dining room with Paige and Jordan. \"I want cake for dessert. Not masghetti,\" Jordan pouted. \"See what you started?\" I said to Fontaine. \"Call him.\" I covered both my ears. \"La la la. I can\u0027t hear you.\" \"Are you calling Daddy, Mommy? Are we going to see him tomorrow?\" Paige asked. They were supposed to, yes. But he hadn\u0027t called to confirm, so I couldn\u0027t be certain. Richard didn\u0027t like to be tied down with tiny details, such as keeping promises to his kids. Plus he was still mad at me for staying here with Fontaine. \"I\u0027ll check with him, Paige. I\u0027ll go call him right now.\" \"Hello?\" Richard drawled into the phone. \"Richard, hi. It\u0027s Sadie. I wanted to check with you about bringing the kids.\" If I could make this conversation short and to the point, maybe we wouldn\u0027t end up fighting. \"Oh, yeah, I was just about to call you.\" I braced myself. Here came the cancellation and some lame-ass excuse, like he had to donate a kidney that day or his boss was sending him to Barbados. \"Listen, I want to apologize for being upset with you last time. I guess Fontaine has a right to stay wherever he wants. And if the kids aren\u0027t freaked out by him or anything, I guess I shouldn\u0027t make you cut your vacation short.\" I pulled the phone away and examined it. This must be a toy, with my wishful imagination creating words in Richard\u0027s voice. He thought apologizing was for pussies. (His expression, not mine.) But the phone was real. I put it back to my ear. \"Richard, are the terrorists making you say this? Do they have a gun to your head?\" He chuckled. \"No, but I\u0027ve done a lot of soul-searching lately. I\u0027m tired of fighting with you all the time and I guess I haven\u0027t been fair - about you staying at Dody\u0027s, I mean. It\u0027s only for a couple months, right? And you promised me Fontaine is behaving himself, so I\u0027m OK with it.\" I sank down to the floor in a heap. Could he mean it? This was 180 degrees from normal. \"Richard, this is so...so open-minded of you.\" \"Yeah, maybe an old dog can learn a few new tricks, huh? You know, I\u0027ve been seeing this therapist, and she\u0027s taught me a lot. You should be proud of me.\" I bit my tongue. So what if he was sleeping with his therapist? If she could turn him into a nicer man, then so be it. It wasn\u0027t any of my business. Richard continued. \"And listen, just to prove I really mean it, why not let me come pick them up this time? I can be in Bell Harbor by noon and take them up to my brother Chet\u0027s place for a couple days. You know, maybe keep them a little longer this time, if that\u0027s OK with you. I\u0027ve got a few vacation days saved up and I\u0027ve been missing my P and J something terrible.\" I put my head in my hand. This was unbefuckinglievable. Aliens had taken over my ex-husband\u0027s body and somehow turned him human in the process. My insides liquefied. I felt whooshy and soft. Dody kept telling me to forgive and forget. If he was finally coming around, maybe now was the time to give that a test run. \"The kids are anxious to see you too, Richard. I\u0027m sure they\u0027d love to have some extra time. Are you sure you don\u0027t mind picking them up?\" \"No, it\u0027s no problem. It\u0027s sort of on the way. Just make sure you pack their life preservers in case we go on Chet\u0027s boat.\" \"Sure, OK.\" Was he actually becoming safety conscious too? I looked out the window for a flying pig. \"Great. Thanks, Sadie. I really appreciate you being so understanding. Chet and his kids will be there. We\u0027re going to fish and camp out, just like we used to do as a family. I\u0027m really looking forward to it.\" After our good-byes, I hung up the phone and sat cross-legged on the floor until Jordan found me. \"Mommy, what are you doing? Are we going to see Daddy?\" \"Yes, baby, you are. And I think you\u0027re going to have a very fun time.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-13.html","bookId":2788,"book":{"id":2788,"title":"Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1)","description":"Storyline: Crazy Little Thing (Bell Harbor #1) If Sadie Turner is good at anything, it\u0027s putting stuff in order. So when she finds her \"perfect\" life in disarray, she hopes a summer vacation at her aunt\u0027s lake house will help her piece it back together. She wants to relax, reboot, and heal the wounds left by her cheating ex-husband. And that requires time away from men. All men. Or so she thinks. With two slobbering dogs and two cousins living there - one a flamboyant decorator intent on making over Sadie - it\u0027s hard to get a moment\u0027s peace at eccentric Aunt Dody\u0027s house, especially with everyone so determined to set her up with Desmond, the sexy new neighbor. Desmond is Sadie\u0027s worst nightmare. Tall, tanned, muscular...and to top it off, he\u0027s great with her kids. But he must have a flaw - he\u0027s a man - so Sadie vows to keep her distance.
