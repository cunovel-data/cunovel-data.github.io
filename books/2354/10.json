{"id":67140,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"THEY WERE SITTING in the living room of Judd\u0027s apartment, talking, Moody\u0027s enormous body spilling over the large couch. Moody had carefully put the pieces of the already defused bomb in the trunk of his own car.\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t you have left it there so the police could have examined it?\" Judd asked.\\n\\n \"I always say that the most confusin\u0027 thing in the world is too much information.\"\\n\\n \"But it would have proved to Lieutenant McGreavy that I\u0027ve been telling the truth.\"\\n\\n \"Would it?\"\\n\\n Judd saw his point. As far as McGreavy was concerned, Judd could have placed it there himself. Still, it seemed odd to him that a private detective would withhold evidence from the police. He had a feeling that Moody was like an enormous iceberg. Most of the man was concealed under the surface, under that facade of gentle, small-town bumbler. But now, as he listened to Moody talking, he was filled with elation. He was not insane and the world had not suddenly become filled with wild coincidences. There was an assassin on the loose. A flesh-and-blood assassin. And for some reason he had chosen Judd as his target. My God, thought Judd, how easily our egos can be destroyed. A few minutes ago he had been ready to believe that he was paranoiac. He owed Moody an incalculable debt.\\n\\n \"...You\u0027re the doctor,\" Moody was saying. \"I\u0027m just an old gumshoe. I always say when you want honey, go to a beehive.\"\\n\\n Judd was beginning to understand Moody\u0027s jargon. \"You want my opinion about the kind of man, or men, we\u0027re looking for.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" beamed Moody. \"Are we dealin\u0027 with some homicidal maniac who broke out of a loony bin\" -\\n\\n Mental institution, Judd thought automatically.\\n\\n - \"or have we got somethin\u0027 deeper goin\u0027 here?\"\\n\\n \"Something deeper,\" said Judd instantly.\\n\\n \"What makes you think so, Doc?\"\\n\\n \"First of all, two men broke into my office last night. I might swallow the theory of one lunatic, but two lunatics working together is too much.\"\\n\\n Moody nodded approvingly. \"Gotcha. Go on.\"\\n\\n \"Secondly, a deranged mind may have an obsession, but it works in a definite pattern. I don\u0027t know why John Hanson and Carol Roberts were killed, but unless I\u0027m wrong, I\u0027m scheduled to be the third and last victim.\"\\n\\n \"What makes you think you\u0027re the last?\" asked Moody curiously.\\n\\n \"Because,\" replied Judd, \"if there were going to be other murders, then the first time they failed to kill me, they would have gone on to get whoever else was on their list. But instead of that, they\u0027ve been concentrating on trying to kill me.\"\\n\\n \"You know,\" said Moody approvingly, \"you have the natural born makin\u0027s of a detective.\"\\n\\n Judd was frowning. \"There are several things that make no sense.\"\\n\\n \"Such as?\"\\n\\n \"First, the motive,\" said Judd. \"I don\u0027t know anyone who - \"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll come back to that. What else?\"\\n\\n \"If someone really was that anxious to kill me, when the car knocked me down, all the driver had to do was to back up and run over me. I was unconscious.\"\\n\\n \"Ah! That\u0027s where Mr. Benson comes in.\"\\n\\n Judd looked at him blankly.\\n\\n \"Mr. Benson is the witness to your accident,\" explained Moody benevolently. \"I got his name from the police report and went to see him after you left my office. That\u0027ll be three-fifty for taxicabs. OK?\"\\n\\n Judd nodded, speechless.\\n\\n \"Mr. Benson - he\u0027s a furrier, by the way. Beautiful stuff. If you ever want to buy anything for your sweetheart, I can get you a discount. Anyway, Tuesday, the night of the accident, he was comin\u0027 out of an office building where his sister-in-law works. He dropped some pills off because his brother Matthew, who\u0027s a Bible salesman, had the flu an\u0027 she was goin\u0027 to take the pills home to him.\"\\n\\n Judd controlled his impatience. If Norman Z. Moody had felt like sitting there and reciting the entire Bill of Rights, he was going to listen.\\n\\n \"So Mr. Benson dropped off these pills an\u0027 was comin\u0027 out of the building when he saw this limousine headin\u0027 toward you. Of course, he didn\u0027t know it was you at the time.\"\\n\\n Judd nodded.\\n\\n \"The car was kinda crabbin\u0027 sideways, an\u0027 from Benson\u0027s angle, it looked like it was in a skid. When he saw it hit you, he started runnin\u0027 over to see if he could help. The limousine backed up to make another run at you. He saw Mr. Benson an\u0027 got out of there like a bat outta hell.\"\\n\\n Judd swallowed. \"So if Mr. Benson hadn\u0027t happened along...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Moody mildly. \"You might say you an\u0027 me wouldn\u0027t have met. These boys aren\u0027t playin\u0027 games. They\u0027re out to get you, Doc.\"\\n\\n \"What about the attack in my office? Why didn\u0027t they break the door down?\"\\n\\n Moody was silent for a moment, thinking. \"That\u0027s a puzzler. They coulda broken in an\u0027 killed you an\u0027 whoever was with you an\u0027 got away without anybody seein\u0027 them. But when they thought you weren\u0027t alone, they left. It don\u0027t fit in with the rest.\" He sat there worrying his lower lip. \"Unless...\" he said.\\n\\n \"Unless what?\"\\n\\n A speculative look came over Moody\u0027s face. \"I wonder...\" he breathed.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll keep for the time bein\u0027. I got me a little idea, but it don\u0027t make sense until we find a motive.\"\\n\\n Judd shrugged helplessly. \"I don\u0027t know of anyone who has a motive for killing me.\"\\n\\n Moody thought about this a moment. \"Doc, could you have any secret that you shared with this patient of yours, Hanson, an\u0027 Carol Roberts? Somethin\u0027 maybe only the three of you knew about?\"\\n\\n Judd shook his head. \"The only secrets I have are professional secrets about my patients. And there\u0027s not one single thing in any of their case histories that would justify murder. None of my patients is a secret agent, or a foreign spy, or an escaped convict. They\u0027re just ordinary people - housewives, professional men, bank clerks - who have problems they can\u0027t cope with.\"\\n\\n Moody looked at him guilelessly. \"An\u0027 you\u0027re sure that you\u0027re not harboring a homicidal maniac in your little group?\"\\n\\n Judd\u0027s voice was firm. \"Positive. Yesterday I might not have been sure. To tell you the truth, I was beginning to think that I was suffering from paranoia and that you were humoring me.\"\\n\\n Moody smiled at him. \"The thought had crossed my mind,\" he said. \"After you phoned me for an appointment, I did some checking up on you. I called a couple of pretty good doctor friends of mine. You got quite a reputation.\"\\n\\n So the \"Mr. Stevenson\" had been part of Moody\u0027s country bumpkin facade.\\n\\n \"If we go to the police now,\" Judd said, \"with what we know, we can at least get them to start looking for whoever\u0027s behind all this.\"\\n\\n Moody looked at him in mild surprise. \"You think so? We don\u0027t really have much to go on yet, do we, Doc?\"\\n\\n It was true.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t be discouraged,\" Moody said. \"I think we\u0027re makin\u0027 real progress. We\u0027ve narrowed it down nicely.\"\\n\\n A note of frustration crept into Judd\u0027s voice. \"Sure. It could be anyone in the Continental United States.\"\\n\\n Moody sat there a moment, contemplating the ceiling. Finally he shook his head. \"Families,\" he sighed.\\n\\n \"Families?\"\\n\\n \"Doc - I believe you when you say you know your patients inside out. If you tell me they couldn\u0027t do anything like this, I have to go along with you. It\u0027s your beehive an\u0027 you\u0027re th\u0027 keeper of the honey.\" He leaned forward on the couch. \"But tell me somethin\u0027. When you take on a patient, do you interview his family?\"\\n\\n \"No. Sometimes the family isn\u0027t even aware that the patient is undergoing psychoanalysis.\"\\n\\n Moody leaned back, satisfied. \"There you are,\" he said.\\n\\n Judd looked at him. \"You think that some member of a patient\u0027s family is trying to kill me?\"\\n\\n \"Could be.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d have no more motive than the patient. Less, probably.\"\\n\\n Moody painfully pushed himself to his feet. \"You never know, do you, Doc? Tell you what I\u0027d like you to do. Get me a list of all the patients you\u0027ve seen in the last four or five weeks. Can you do that?\"\\n\\n Judd hesitated. \"No,\" he said, finally.\\n\\n \"That confidential patient-doctor business? I think maybe it\u0027s time to bend that a little. Your life\u0027s at stake.\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re on the wrong track. What\u0027s been happening has nothing to do with my patients or their families. If there had been any insanity in their families, it would have come out in the psychoanalysis.\" He shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Moody. I have to protect my patients.\"\\n\\n \"You said there was nothing in the files that was important.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing that\u0027s important to us.\" He thought of some of the material in the files. John Hanson picking up sailors in gay bars on Third Avenue. Teri Washburn making love to the boys in the band. Fourteen-year-old Evelyn Warshak, the resident prostitute in the ninth grade... \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said again. \"I can\u0027t show you the files.\"\\n\\n Moody shrugged. \"OK,\" he said. \"OK. Then you\u0027re gonna have to do part of my job for me.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want me to do?\"\\n\\n \"Take out the tapes on everybody you\u0027ve had on your couch for the last month. Listen real careful to each one. Only this time don\u0027t listen like a doctor - listen like a detective - look for anything the least bit offbeat.\"\\n\\n \"I do that anyway. That\u0027s my job.\"\\n\\n \"Do it again. An\u0027 keep your eyes open. I don\u0027t want to lose you \u0027til we solve this case.\" He picked up his overcoat and struggled into it, making it look like an elephant ballet. Fat men were supposed to be graceful, thought Judd, but that did not include Mr. Moody. \"Do you know the most peculiar thing about this whole megillah?\" queried Moody thoughtfully.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You put your finger on it before, when you said there were two men. Maybe one man might have a burning itch to knock you off - but why two?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Moody studied him a moment, speculatively. \"By God!\" he finally said.\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"I just might have a brainstorm. If I\u0027m right, there could be more than two men out to kill you.\"\\n\\n Judd stared at him incredulously. \"You mean there\u0027s a whole group of maniacs after me? That doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n There was a look of growing excitement on Moody\u0027s face. \"Doctor, I\u0027ve got an idea who the umpire in this ballgame might be.\" He looked at Judd, his eyes bright. \"I don\u0027t know how yet, or why - but it could be I know who.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n Moody shook his head. \"You\u0027d have me sent to a cracker factory if I told you. I always say if you\u0027re gonna shoot off your mouth, make sure it\u0027s loaded first. Let me do a little target practice. If I\u0027m on the right track, I\u0027ll tell you.\"\\n\\n \"I hope you are,\" Judd said earnestly.\\n\\n Moody looked at him a moment. \"No, Doc. If you value your life worth a damn - pray I\u0027m wrong.\"\\n\\n And Moody was gone.\\n\\n He took a taxi to the office.\\n\\n It was Friday noon, and with only three more shopping days until Christmas, the streets were crowded with late shoppers, bundled up against the raw wind sweeping in from the Hudson River. The store windows were festive and bright, filled with lighted Christmas trees and carved figures of the Nativity. Peace on Earth. Christmas. And Elizabeth, and their unborn baby. One day soon - if he survived - he would have to make his own peace, free himself from the dead past and let go. He knew that with Anne he could have...He firmly stopped himself. What was the point in fantasizing about a married woman about to go away with her husband, whom she loved?\\n\\n The taxi pulled up in front of his office building and Judd got out, nervously looking around. But what could he look for? He had no idea what the murder weapon would be, or who would wield it.\\n\\n When he reached his office, he locked the outer door, went to the paneling that concealed the tapes, and opened it. The tapes were filed chronologically, under the name of each patient. He selected the most recent ones and carried them over to the tape recorder. With all his appointments canceled for the day, he would be able to concentrate on trying to find some clue that might involve the friends or families of his patients. He felt that Moody\u0027s suggestion was farfetched, but he had too much respect for him to ignore it.\\n\\n As he put on the first tape, he remembered the last time he had used the machine. Was it only last night? The memory filled him again with the sharp sense of nightmare. Someone had planned to murder him here in this room, where they had murdered Carol.\\n\\n He suddenly realized that he had given no thought to his patients at the free hospital clinic where he worked one morning a week. It was probably because the murders had revolved around this office rather than the hospital. Still...He walked over to a section of the cabinets labeled \"CLINIC,\" looked through some of the tapes, and finally selected half a dozen. He put the first one on the tape recorder.\\n\\n Rose Graham.\\n\\n \"...an accident, Doctor. Nancy cries a lot. She\u0027s always been a whiny baby, so when I hit her, it\u0027s for her own good, y\u0027know?\"\\n\\n \"Did you ever try to find out why Nancy cries a lot?\" Judd\u0027s voice asked.\\n\\n \"\u0027Cause she\u0027s spoiled. Her daddy spoiled her rotten and then run off and left us. Nancy always thought she was daddy\u0027s girl, but how much could Harry really have loved her if he run off like that?\"\\n\\n \"You and Harry were never married, were you?\"\\n\\n \"Well...Common law, I guess you\u0027d call it. We was goin\u0027 to get married.\"\\n\\n \"How long did you live together?\"\\n\\n \"Four years.\"\\n\\n \"How long was it after Harry left you that you broke Nancy\u0027s arm?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Bout a week, I guess. I didn\u0027t mean to break it. It\u0027s just that she wouldn\u0027t stop whining, so I finally picked up this curtain rod an\u0027 started beating on her.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think Harry loved Nancy more than he loved you?\"\\n\\n \"No. Harry was crazy about me.\"\\n\\n \"Then why do you think he left you?\"\\n\\n \"Because he was a man. An\u0027 y\u0027know what men are? Animals! All of you! You should all be slaughtered like pigs!\" Sobbing.\\n\\n Judd switched off the tape and thought about Rose Graham. She was a psychotic misanthrope, and she had nearly beaten her six-year-old child to death on two separate occasions. But the pattern of the murders did not fit Rose Graham\u0027s psychosis.\\n\\n He put on the next tape from the clinic.\\n\\n Alexander Fallon.\\n\\n \"The police say that you attacked Mr. Champion with a knife, Mr. Fallon.\"\\n\\n \"I only did what I was told.\"\\n\\n \"Someone told you to kill Mr. Champion?\"\\n\\n \"He told me to do it.\"\\n\\n \"He?\"\\n\\n \"God.\"\\n\\n \"Why did God tell you to kill him?\"\\n\\n \"Because Champion\u0027s an evil man. He\u0027s an actor. I saw him on the stage. He kissed this woman. This actress. In front of the whole audience. He kissed her and...\"\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n \"Go on.\"\\n\\n \"He touched her - her titty.\"\\n\\n \"Did that upset you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course! It upset me terribly. Don\u0027t you understand what that meant? He had carnal knowledge of her. When I came out of that theater, I felt like I had just come from Sodom and Gomorrah. They had to be punished.\"\\n\\n \"So you decided to kill him.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t decide it. God decided. I just carried out His orders.\"\\n\\n \"Does God often talk to you?\"\\n\\n \"Only when there\u0027s His work to be done. He\u0027s chosen me as His instrument, because I\u0027m pure. Do you know what makes me pure? Do you know what the most cleansing thing in the world is? Slaying the wicked!\"\\n\\n Alexander Fallon. Thirty-five, a part-time baker\u0027s assistant. He had been sent to a mental home for six months and then released. Could God have told him to destroy Hanson, a homosexual, and Carol, a former prostitute, and Judd, their benefactor? Judd decided that it was unlikely. Fallon\u0027s thought processes took place in brief, painful spasms. Whoever had planned the murders was highly organized.\\n\\n He played several more of the tapes from the clinic, but none of them fit into the pattern he was searching for. No. It wasn\u0027t any patient at the clinic.\\n\\n He looked over the office files again and a name caught his eye.\\n\\n Skeet Gibson.\\n\\n He put on the tape.\\n\\n \"\u0027Mornin\u0027, Dockie. How do you like this bee-u-ti-ful day I cooked up for you?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re feeling good today.\"\\n\\n \"If I was feelin\u0027 any better, they\u0027d have me locked up. Did you catch my show last night?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m sorry, I wasn\u0027t able to.\"\\n\\n \"I was only a smash. Jack Gould called me \u0027the most lovable comedian in the world.\u0027 An\u0027 who am I to argue with a genius like Jack Gould? You shoulda heard that audience! They were applauding like it was going out of style. Do ya know what that proves?\"\\n\\n \"That they can read \u0027Applause\u0027 cards?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sharp, you devil, you. That\u0027s what I like - a headshrinker with a sense of humor. The last one I had was a drag. Had a great big beard that really bugged me.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because it was a lady!\"\\n\\n Loud laughter.\\n\\n \"Gotcha that time, didn\u0027t I, old cock? Seriously, folks, one of the reasons I\u0027m feelin\u0027 so good is because I just pledged a million dollars - count \u0027em: one million bucks - to help the kids in Biafra.\"\\n\\n \"No wonder you feel good.\"\\n\\n \"You bet your sweet ass. That story hit the front pages all over the world.\"\\n\\n \"Is that important?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean, \u0027Is that important?\u0027 How many guys pledge that kind of loot? You\u0027ve gotta blow your own horn, Peter Pan. I\u0027m glad I can afford to pledge the money.\"\\n\\n \"You keep saying \u0027pledge.\u0027 Do you mean \u0027give?\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Pledge - give - what\u0027s the difference? You pledge a million - give a few grand - an\u0027 they kiss your ass... Did I tell you it\u0027s my anniversary today?\"\\n\\n \"No. Congratulations.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. Fifteen great years. You never met Sally. There\u0027s the sweetest broad that ever walked God\u0027s earth. I really got lucky with my marriage. You know what a pain in the keester in-laws can be? Well, Sally\u0027s got these two brothers, Ben an\u0027 Charley. I told you about them. Ben\u0027s head writer on my TV show an\u0027 Charley\u0027s my producer. They\u0027re geniuses. I\u0027ve been on the air seven years now. An\u0027 we\u0027re never outta the top ten in the Nielsen\u0027s. I was smart to marry into a family like that, huh? Most women get fat an\u0027 sloppy once they\u0027ve hooked their husband. But Sally, bless her, is slimmer now than the day we were married. What a dame!...Got a cigarette?\"\\n\\n \"Here. I thought you quit smoking.\"\\n\\n \"I just wanted to show myself I had the old willpower, so I quit. Now I\u0027m smoking because I want to... I made a new deal with the network yesterday. I really shafted \u0027em. Is my time up yet?\"\\n\\n \"No. Are you restless, Skeet?\"\\n\\n \"To tell you the truth, sweetie, I\u0027m in such great shape I don\u0027t know what the hell I\u0027m coming in here any more for.\"\\n\\n \"No more problems?\"\\n\\n \"Me? The world\u0027s my oyster an\u0027 I\u0027m Diamond Jim Brady. I\u0027ve gotta hand it to you. You\u0027ve really helped me. You\u0027re my man. With the kind of money you make, maybe I should go into business and set up my own shingle, huh?...That reminds me of the great story of the guy who goes to a wig-picker, but he\u0027s so nervous he just lays on the couch and doesn\u0027t say anything. At the end of the hour, the shrink says, \u0027That\u0027ll be fifty dollars.\u0027 Well, that goes on for two whole years without the schmuck saying one word. Finally the little guy opens his mouth one day and says, \u0027Doctor - could I ask you a question?\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 says the Doc. And the little guy says, \u0027Would you like a partner?\u0027 \"\\n\\n Loud laughter.\\n\\n \"You got a shot of aspirin or somethin\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly. Is it one of your bad headaches?\"\\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027 I can\u0027t handle, old buddy... Thanks. That\u0027ll do the trick.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think brings these headaches on?\"\\n\\n \"Just normal show-biz tension... We have our script reading this afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Does that make you nervous?\"\\n\\n \"Me? Hell, no! What have I got to be nervous about? If the jokes are lousy, I make a face, wink at the audience, an\u0027 they eat it up. No matter how bad the show is, little old Skeet comes out smelling like a rose.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you think you have these headaches every week?\"\\n\\n \"How the fuck do I know? You\u0027re supposed to be a doctor. You tell me. I don\u0027t pay you to sit on your fat ass for an hour asking stupid questions. Jesus Christ, if an idiot like you can\u0027t cure a simple headache, they shouldn\u0027t let you be running around loose, messing up people\u0027s lives. Where\u0027d you get your medical certificate? From a veterinarian school? I wouldn\u0027t trust my fuckin\u0027 cats with you. You\u0027re a goddam quack! The only reason I came to you in the first place was because Sally shitted me into it. It was the only way I could get her off my back. Do ya know my definition of Hell? Bein\u0027 married to an ugly, skinny nag for fifteen years. If you\u0027re lookin\u0027 for some more suckers to cheat, take on her two idiot brothers, Ben an\u0027 Charley. Ben, my head writer, doesn\u0027t know which end of the pencil has the lead in it, an\u0027 his brother\u0027s even stupider. I wish they\u0027d all drop dead. They\u0027re out to get me. You think I like you? You stink! You\u0027re so goddam smug, sitting there looking down on everybody. You haven\u0027t got any problems, have you? Do you know why? Because you\u0027re not for real. You\u0027re out of it. All you do is sit on your fat keester all day long an\u0027 steal money from sick people. Well, I\u0027m gonna get you, you sonofabitch. I\u0027m gonna report you to the AMA...\"\\n\\n Sobbing.\\n\\n \"I wish I didn\u0027t have to go to that goddam reading.\"\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n \"Well - keep your pecker up. See ya next week, sweetie.\"\\n\\n Judd switched off the recorder. Skeet Gibson, America\u0027s most beloved comedian, should have been institutionalized ten years ago. His hobbies were beating up young, blond showgirls and getting into barroom brawls. Skeet was a small man, but he had started out as a prizefighter, and he knew how to hurt. One of his favorite sports was going into a gay bar, coaxing an unsuspecting homosexual into the men\u0027s room, and beating him unconscious. Skeet had been picked up by the police several times, but the incidents had always been hushed up. After all, he was America\u0027s most lovable comic. Skeet was paranoid enough to want to kill, and he was capable of killing in a fit of rage. But Judd did not think he was cold-blooded enough to carry out this kind of planned vendetta. And in that, Judd felt certain, lay the key to the solution. Whoever was trying to murder him was doing it not in the heat of any passion, but methodically and cold-bloodedly.
