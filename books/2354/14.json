Moody\u0027s body had been taken away and everyone had de parted except Judd, McGreavy, and Angeli. They were sit ting in the manager\u0027s small office, decorated with several im pressive calendar nudes, an old desk, a swivel chair, and two filing cabinets. The lights were on and an electric heater was going.\\n\\n The manager of the plant, a Mr. Paul Moretti, had been tracked down and pulled away from a pre-Christmas party to answer some questions. He had explained that since it was a holiday weekend, he had let his employees off at noon. He had locked up at twelve-thirty, and to the best of his knowl edge, there had been no one on the premises at that time. Mr. Moretti was belligerently drunk, and when McGreavy saw that he was going to be no further help, he had him driven home. Judd was barely conscious of what was happen ing in the room. His thoughts were on Moody, how cheerful and how full of life he had been, and how cruelly he had died. And Judd blamed himself. If he had not involved Moody, the little detective would be alive today.\\n\\n It was almost midnight. Judd had wearily reiterated the story of Moody\u0027s phone call for the tenth time. McGreavy, hunched up in his overcoat, sat there watching him, chewing savagely on a cigar. Finally he spoke. \"Do you read detective stories?\"\\n\\n Judd looked at him, surprised. \"No. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you why. I think you\u0027re just too goddam good to be true, Dr. Stevens. From the very beginning I\u0027ve thought that you were in this thing up to your neck. And I told you so. So what happens? Suddenly you turn into the target instead of the killer. First you claim a car ran you down and - \"\\n\\n \"A car did run him down,\" Angeli reminded him.\\n\\n \"A rookie could answer that one,\" McGreavy snapped. \"It could have been arranged by someone who\u0027s in this with the doctor.\" He turned back to Judd. \"Next, you call Detective Angeli with a wild-eyed yarn about two men breaking into your office and trying to kill you.\"\\n\\n \"They did break in,\" said Judd.\\n\\n \"No, they didn\u0027t,\" snapped McGreavy. \"They used a spe cial key.\" His voice hardened. \"You said there were only two of those keys to that office - yours and Carol Roberts\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I told you - they copied Carol\u0027s key.\"\\n\\n \"I know what you told me. I had a paraffin test run. Carol\u0027s key was never copied, Doctor.\" He paused to let it sink in. \"And since I have her key - that leaves yours, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Judd looked at him, speechless.\\n\\n \"When I didn\u0027t buy the loose maniac theory, you hire a detective out of the yellow pages, and he conveniently finds a bomb planted in your car. Only I can\u0027t see it because it\u0027s not there any more. Then you decide it\u0027s time to throw me another body, so you go through that rigmarole with Angeli about a phone call to meet Moody, who knows this mysteri ous nut who\u0027s out to kill you. But guess what? We get here and find him hanging on a meat hook.\"\\n\\n Judd flushed angrily. \"I\u0027m not responsible for what happened.\"\\n\\n McGreavy gave him a long, hard look. \"Do you know the only reason you\u0027re not under arrest? Because I haven\u0027t found any motive to this Chinese puzzle yet. But I will, Doctor. That\u0027s a promise.\" He got to his feet.\\n\\n Judd suddenly remembered. \"Wait a minute!\" he said. \"What about Don Vinton?\"\\n\\n \"What about him?\"\\n\\n \"Moody said he was the man behind all this.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know anyone named Don Vinton?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Judd said. \"I - I assumed he\u0027d be known by the police.\"\\n\\n \"I never heard of him.\" McGreavy turned to Angeli. Angeli shook his head.\\n\\n \"OK. Send out a make on Don Vinton. FBI. Interpol. Po lice chiefs in all major American cities.\" He looked at Judd. \"Satisfied?\"\\n\\n Judd nodded. Whoever was behind all this must have some kind of criminal record. It should not be difficult to identify him.\\n\\n He thought again of Moody, with his homely aphorisms and his quick mind. He must have been followed here. It was unlikely that he would have told anyone else about the rendezvous, because he had stressed the need for secrecy. At least they now knew the name of the man they were looking for.\\n\\n Praemonitus, praemunitas.\\n\\n Forewarned, forearmed.\\n\\n The murder of Norman Z. Moody was splashed all over the front pages of the newspapers the next morning. Judd picked up a paper on his way to the office. He was briefly mentioned as being a witness who had come across the body with the police, but McGreavy had managed to keep the full story out of the papers. McGreavy was playing his cards close to his chest. Judd wondered what Anne would think.\\n\\n This was Saturday, when Judd made his morning rounds at the clinic. He had arranged for someone else to fill in for him there. He went to his office, traveling alone in the elevator and making sure that no one was lurking in the cor ridor. He wondered, even as he did so, how long anyone could live like this, expecting an assassin to strike at any moment.\\n\\n Half a dozen times during the morning he started to pick up the phone and call Detective Angeli to ask about Don Vinton, but each time he controlled his impatience. Angeli would surely call him as soon as he knew something. Judd puzzled over what Don Vinton\u0027s motivation could be. He could have been a patient whom Judd had treated years ago, perhaps when he was an intern. Someone who felt that Judd had slighted him or injured him in some way. But he could remember no patient named Vinton.\\n\\n At noon he heard someone try to open the corridor door to the reception room. It was Angeli. Judd could tell nothing from his expression except that he looked even more drawn and haggard. His nose was red, and he was sniffling. He walked into the inner office and wearily flopped into a chair.\\n\\n \"Have you gotten any answers yet on Don Vinton?\" Judd asked eagerly.\\n\\n Angeli nodded. \"We got back teletypes from the FBI, the police chiefs of every big city in the United States, and Inter pol.\" Judd waited, afraid to breathe. \"None of them ever heard of Don Vinton.\"\\n\\n Judd looked at Angeli incredulously, a sudden sinking sensation in his stomach. \"But that\u0027s impossible! I mean - someone must know him. A man who could do all this just didn\u0027t come out of nowhere!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what McGreavy said,\" replied Angeli wearily. \"Doctor, my men and I spent the night checking out every Don Vinton in Manhattan and all the other boroughs. We even covered New Jersey and Connecticut.\" He took a ruled sheet of paper out of his pocket and showed it to Judd. \"W e found eleven Don Vintons in the phone book who spell their name \u0027ton\u0027 - four who spell it \u0027ten\u0027 - and two who spell it \u0027tin.\u0027 We even tried it as one name. We narrowed it down to five possibles and checked out every one of them. One is a paralytic. One of them is a priest. One is first vice-president of a bank. One of them is a fireman who was on duty when two of the murders occurred. I just left the last one. He runs a pet shop and he must be damn near eighty years old.\"\\n\\n Judd\u0027s throat was dry. He was suddenly aware of how much he had counted on this. Surely Moody wouldn\u0027t have given him the name unless he was certain. And he hadn\u0027t said that Don Vinton was an accomplice; he had said he was behind the whole thing. It was inconceivable that the police would have no record of a man like that. Moody had been murdered because he had gotten onto the truth. And now that Moody was out of the way, Judd was completely alone. The web was drawing tighter.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Angeli said.\\n\\n Judd looked at the detective and suddenly remembered that Angeli had not been home all night. \"I appreciate your trying,\" he said gratefully.\\n\\n Angeli leaned forward. \"Are you positive you heard Moody right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Judd closed his eyes in concentration. He had asked Moody if he was sure who was really behind this. He heard Moody\u0027s voice again. Dead sure. Have you ever heard of Don Vinton? Don Vinton. He opened his eyes. \"Yes,\" he repeated.\\n\\n Angeli sighed. \"The n we\u0027re at a dead end.\" He laughed mirthlessly. \"N o pun intended.\" He sneezed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better get to bed.\"\\n\\n Angeli stood up. \"Yeah. I guess so.\"\\n\\n Judd hesitated. \"How long have you been McGreavy\u0027s partner?\"\\n\\n \"This is our first case together. Why? \"\\n\\n \"Do you think he\u0027s capable of framing me for murder?\"\\n\\n Angeli sneezed again. \" I think maybe you\u0027re right, doctor. I\u0027d better get to bed.\" He walked over to the door.\\n\\n \"I may have a lead,\" Judd said.\\n\\n Angeli stopped and turned. \"Go on.\"\\n\\n Judd told him about Teri. He added that he was also going to check out some of John Hanson\u0027s former boy friends.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t sound like much,\" Angeli said frankly, \"but I guess it\u0027s better than nothing.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sick and tired of being a target. I\u0027m going to start fighting back. I\u0027m going after them.\"\\n\\n Angeli looked at him. \"With what? We\u0027re fighting shadows.\"\\n\\n \"When witnesses describe a suspect, the police have an artist draw up a composite picture of all the descriptions. Right?\"\\n\\n Angeli nodded. \"An identi-kit.\"\\n\\n Judd began to pace in restless excitement. \"I\u0027m going to give you an identi-kit of the personality of the man who\u0027s behind this.\"\\n\\n \"How can you? You\u0027ve never seen him. It could be anyone.\"\\n\\n \"No it couldn\u0027t,\" Judd corrected. \"We\u0027re looking for someone very, very special.\"\\n\\n \"Someone who\u0027s insane.\"\\n\\n \"Insanity is a catchall phrase. It has no medical meaning. Sanity is simply the ability of the mind to adjust to reality. If we can\u0027t adjust, we either hide from reality, or we put our selves above life, where we\u0027re super-beings who don\u0027t have to follow the rules.\"\\n\\n \"Our man thinks he\u0027s a super-being.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. In a dangerous situation we have three choices, Angeli. Flight, constructive compromise, or attack. Our man attacks.\"\\n\\n \"So he\u0027s a lunatic.\"\\n\\n \"No. Lunatics rarely kill. Their concentration span is ex tremely short. We\u0027re dealing with someone more compli cated. He could be somatic, hypophrenic, schizoid, cycloid - or any combination of these. We could be dealing with a fugue - temporary amnesia preceded by irrational acts. But the point is, his appearance and behavior will seem perfectly normal to everyone.\"\\n\\n \"So we have nothing to go on.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong. We have a good deal to go on. I can give you a physical description of him,\" said Judd. He narrowed his eyes, concentrating. \"Don Vinton is above average height, well proportioned, and has the build of an athlete. He\u0027s neat in his appearance and meticulous about everything he does. He has no artistic talent. He doesn\u0027t paint or write or play the piano.\"\\n\\n Angeli was staring at him, open-mouthed.\\n\\n Judd continued, speaking more quickly now, warming up. \"He doesn\u0027t belong to any social clubs or organizations. Not unless he runs them. He\u0027s a man who has to be in charge. He\u0027s ruthless, and he\u0027s impatient. He thinks big. For exam ple, he\u0027d never get involved in petty thefts. If he had a rec ord, it would be for bank robbery, kidnapping, or murder.\" Judd\u0027s excitement was growing. The picture was growing sharper in his mind. \"When you catch him, you\u0027ll find that he was probably rejected by one of his parents when he was a boy.\"\\n\\n Angeli interrupted. \"Doctor, I don\u0027t want to shoot down your balloon, but it could be some crazy, hopped-up junkie who - \"\\n\\n \"No. The man we\u0027re looking for doesn\u0027t take drugs.\" Judd\u0027s voice was positive. \"I\u0027ll tell you something else about him. He played contact sports in school. Football or hockey. He has no interest in chess, word games, or puzzles.\"\\n\\n Angeli was watching him skeptically. \"There was more than one man,\" he objected. \"You said so yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m giving you a description of Don Vinton,\" said Judd. \"The man who\u0027s masterminding this. I\u0027ll tell you something more about him. He\u0027s a Latin type.\"\\n\\n \"What makes you think so?\"\\n\\n \"Because of the methods used in the murders. A knife - acid - a bomb. He\u0027s South American, Italian, or Spanish.\" He took a breath. \"There\u0027s your identi-kit. That\u0027s the man who\u0027s committed three murders and is trying to kill me.\"\\n\\n Angeli swallowed. \"How the hell do you know all this?\"\\n\\n Judd sat down and leaned toward Angeli. \"It\u0027s my profession.\"\\n\\n \"The mental side, sure. But how can you give a physical description of a man you\u0027ve never seen?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m playing the odds. A doctor named Kretschmer found that eighty-five percent of people suffering from paranoia have well-built, athletic bodies. Our man is an obvious para noiac. He has delusions of grandeur. He\u0027s a megalomaniac who thinks he\u0027s above the law.\"\\n\\n \"The n why wasn\u0027t he locked up a long time ago?\"\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s wearing a mask.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s what?\"\\n\\n \"We all wear masks, Angeli. From the time we\u0027re past in fancy, we\u0027re taught to conceal our real feelings, to cover up our hatreds and fears.\" There was authority in his voice. \"But under stress, Don Vinton is going to drop his mask and show his naked face.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"His ego is his vulnerable point. If it\u0027s threatened - really threatened - he\u0027ll crack. He\u0027s on the thin edge now. It won\u0027t take much to send him completely over.\" He hesitated, then went on, speaking almost to himself. \"He\u0027s a man with - mana.\"\\n\\n \"With what?\"\\n\\n \"Mana. It\u0027s a term that the primitives use for a man who exerts influence on others because of the demons in him, a man with an overpowering personality.\"\\n\\n \"You said he doesn\u0027t paint, write, or play the piano. How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"The world is full of artists who are schizoids. Most of them manage to get through life without any violence be cause their work gives them an outlet in which to express themselves. Our man doesn\u0027t have that outlet. So he\u0027s like a volcano. The only way he can get rid of the pressure inside him is to erupt: Hanson - Carol - Moody.\"\\n\\n \"You mean these were just senseless crimes that he committed to - \"\\n\\n \"Not senseless to him. On the contrary...\" His mind raced ahead swiftly. Several more pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall into place. He cursed himself for having been too blind, or frightened, to see them. \"I\u0027 m the only one Don Vinton has been after - the prime target. John Hanson was killed because he was mistaken for me. When the killer found out his mistake, he came to the office for another try. I had gone, but he found Carol there.\" His voice was angry.\\n\\n \"He killed her so she couldn\u0027t identify him?\"\\n\\n \"No. The man we\u0027re looking for isn\u0027t a sadist. Carol was tortured because he wanted something. Say, a piece of in criminating evidence. And she wouldn\u0027t - or couldn\u0027t - give it to him.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of evidence?\" probed Angeli.\\n\\n \"I have no idea,\" Judd said. \"But it\u0027s the key to this whole thing. Moody found out the answer, and that\u0027s why they killed him.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s one thing that still doesn\u0027t make sense. If they had killed you on the street, then they couldn\u0027t have gotten the evidence. It doesn\u0027t fit with the rest of your theory,\" An geli persisted.\\n\\n \"It could. Let\u0027s assume that the evidence is on one of my tapes. It might be perfectly harmless by itself, but if I put it together with other facts, it could threaten them. So they have two choices. Either take it away from me, or eliminate me so I can\u0027t reveal it to anyone. First they tried to eliminate me. But they made a mistake and killed Hanson. Then they went to the second alternative. They tried to get it from Carol. When that failed, they decided to concentrate on kill ing me. That was the car accident. I was probably followed when I went to hire Moody, and he, in turn, was followed. When he got onto the truth, they murdered him.\"\\n\\n Angeli looked at Judd, a thoughtful frown on his face.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why the killer is not going to stop until I\u0027m dead,\" Judd concluded quietly. \"It\u0027s become a deadly game, and the man I\u0027ve described can\u0027t stand losing.\"\\n\\n Angeli was studying him, weighing what Judd had said. \"If you\u0027re right,\" he said finally, \"you\u0027re going to need protection.\" He took his service revolver out, flipped the chamber open to make sure it was fully loaded.\\n\\n \"Thanks, Angeli, but I don\u0027t need a gun. I\u0027m going to fight them with my own weapons.\"\\n\\n There was the sharp click of the outer door opening. \"Were you expecting anyone?\"\\n\\n Judd shook his head. \"No. I have no patients this afternoon.\"\\n\\n Gun still in hand, Angeli moved quietly to the door leading to the reception room. He stepped to one side and yanked the door open. Peter Hadley stood there, a bewildered expression on his face. \"Who are you?\" Angeli snapped.\\n\\n Judd moved over to the door. \"It\u0027s all right,\" Judd said quickly. \"He\u0027s a friend of mine.\"\\n\\n \"Hey! What the hell goes?\" asked Peter.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Angeli apologized. He put his gun away.\\n\\n \"This is Dr. Peter Hadley - Detective Angeli.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of nutty psychiatric clinic are you running here?\" Peter asked.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s been a little trouble,\" Angeli explained. \"Dr. Stevens\u0027 office has been...burglarized, and we thought whoever did it might be returning.\"\\n\\n Judd picked up the cue. \"Yes. They didn\u0027t find what they were looking for.\"\\n\\n \"Does this have anything to do with Carol\u0027s murder?\" Peter asked.\\n\\n Angeli spoke before Judd could answer. \"We\u0027re not sure, Dr. Hadley. For the moment, the Department has asked Dr. Stevens not to discuss the case.\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" Peter said. He looked at Judd. \"Is our luncheon date still on?\"\\n\\n Judd realized he had forgotten about it. \"Of course,\" he said quickly. He turned to Angeli. \"I think we\u0027ve covered everything.\"\\n\\n \"And then some,\" Angeli agreed. \"You\u0027re sure you don\u0027t want...\" He indicated his revolver.\\n\\n Judd shook his head. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"OK. Be careful,\" Angeli said.\\n\\n \"I will,\" Judd promised. \"I will.\"\\n\\n Judd was preoccupied during luncheon, and Peter did not press him. They talked of mutual friends, patients that they had in common. Peter told Judd he had spoken to Harrison Burke\u0027s employer and it had been quietly arranged for Burke to have a mental examination. He was being sent to a private institution.\\n\\n Over coffee Peter said, \"I don\u0027t know what kind of trouble you\u0027re having, Judd, but if I can be of any help...\"\\n\\n Judd shook his head. \"Thanks, Peter. This is something I have to take care of myself. I\u0027ll tell you all about it when it\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n \"I hope that\u0027s soon,\" Peter said lightly. He hesitated. \"Judd - are you in any danger?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" replied Judd.\\n\\n Unless you counted a homicidal maniac who had committed three murders and was determined to make Judd his fourth victim. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-naked-face/page-14.html","bookId":2354,"book":{"id":2354,"title":"The Naked Face","description":"Storyline: Judd Stevens is a psychoanalyst faced with the most critical case of his life.
