{"id":71684,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"His small pencil flash flickered here and there. He hoped earnestly that what he sought for would not be behind still additional locks. If it were, he would have to use force, and he was in no mood to attract attention just then. There was no safe that he could see; nothing equivalent to such an object. That was both good and bad. What he looked for would not be out of reach, but then again it might not be in the room at all.\\n\\n That would be a pity after the carefully planned manner in which he had obtained the key to this room. Hennes would not recover quickly from the working out of that plan.\\n\\n David smiled. He himself had been almost as surprised as Hennes at the very first. His words, \"I am the Space Ranger,\" had been the first he had spoken through the force-shield since his emergence from the Martian caverns. He could not remember what his voice had sounded like there. Perhaps he had not truly heard it. Perhaps, under Martian influence, he had simply sensed his own thoughts as he did theirs.\\n\\n Here on the surface, however, the sound of his own voice had left him thunderstruck. Its hollowness and booming depth had been entirely unexpected. He recovered, of course, and understood almost immediately. Although the shield let air molecules pass, it probably slowed them. Such interference would naturally affect sound waves.\\n\\n David was not exactly sorry for that. The voice, as it was, would be helpful.\\n\\n The shield had worked well against the blaster radiation. The flash had not been stopped entirely; he had seen it clearly. At least the effect upon himself had been nothing compared to that upon Hermes.\\n\\n Methodically, even as his weary mind turned these things over, he was inspecting the contents of shelves and cabinets.\\n\\n The light beam held steady for a moment. David reached past other gadgets to pick up a small metal object. He turned it over and over in the small light. He wound a little button which set at different positions and observed what happened afterward.\\n\\n His heart bounded.\\n\\n It was the final proof. The proof of all his speculations-the speculations that had been so reasonable and so complete and yet had rested upon nothing more than logic. Now the logic had been borne out by something made of molecules, something that could be touched and felt.\\n\\n He put it in his hip-boot pocket to join his mask and the keys he had taken from Hennes\u0027s boots earlier in the night.\\n\\n He locked the door behind him and stepped out into the open. The dome above was beginning to gray visibly. Soon the main fluorescents would go oa and day would officially begin. The last day, either for the poisoners or for Earth civilization as it then was.\\n\\n Meanwhile there would be a chance for sleep.\\n\\n The Makian farm dome lay in a frozen quiet. Few of the farmboys could even guess at what was going on. That it was something serious was, of course, obvious, but further than that it was impossible to see. Some few whispered that Makian had been caught in serious financial irregularities, but no one could believe it. It wasn\u0027t even logical, since why would they send in an army just for that?\\n\\n Certainly hard-faced men in uniform circled Central Building with repeater blasters cradled in their arms. On the roof of the building two artillery pieces had been set up. And the area around it was deserted. All farmboys, except those necessary for the maintenance of essential utilities, had been restricted to barracks. Those few excepted were ordered to remain strictly at their jobs.\\n\\n At 12:15 p.m. exactly, the two men patrolling the rear of the building separated, moved away, leaving that area unguarded. At twelve-thirty they returned and took up their patrols. One of the artillerymen on the roof afterward stated that he had seen someone enter the building in that interval. He admitted he had caught only a brief glimpse and his description did not make very much sense, since he said it seemed to be a man on fire.\\n\\n Nobody believed him at the time.\\n\\n Dr. Silvers was not certain of anything. Not at all certain. He scarcely knew how to begin the session. He looked at the other four that sat about the table.\\n\\n Makian. He looked as if he hadn\u0027t slept in a week. Probably hadn\u0027t, either. He hadn\u0027t spoken a word so far. Silvers wondered if he was completely aware of his surroundings.\\n\\n Hennes. He was wearing dark glasses. He took them off at one time and his eyes were bloodshot and angry. Now he sat there muttering to himself.\\n\\n Benson. Quiet and unhappy. Dr. Silvers had spent several hours with him the night before and there was no doubt in his mind that the failures of his investigations were an embarrassment and a grief to him. He had spoken about Martians, native Martians, as causes of the poisonings, but Silvers had known better than to take that seriously.\\n\\n Bigman. The only happy one of the lot. To be sure he understood only a fragment of the real crisis. He was leaning back in his chair, obviously pleased at being at the same table with important people, savoring his role to the full.\\n\\n And there was one additional chair that Silvers had brought to the table. It stood there, empty and waiting. No one commented on the fact.\\n\\n Dr. Silvers kept the conversation going somehow, making insubstantial remarks, trying to mask his own uncertainties. Like the empty chair, he was waiting.\\n\\n At twelve-sixteen he looked up and rose slowly to his feet. No words came. Bigman pushed his chair back and it went over with a crash. Hennes\u0027s head turned sharply and he grasped the table with fingers that became white with strain. Benson looked about and whimpered. Only Makian seemed unmoved. His eyes lifted, then, apparently, took in the sight merely as another incomprehensible element in a world that had grown too large and strange for him.\\n\\n The figure in the doorway said, \"I am the Space Ranger!\"\\n\\n In the bright lights of the room the glow that surrounded his head was somewhat subdued, the smoke that concealed his body somewhat more substantial than Hennes had seen it the night before.\\n\\n The Space Ranger moved in. Almost automatically the seated men pushed their chairs away, clearing a place at the table, so that the one empty chair stood in lonely isolation.\\n\\n The Space Ranger sat down, face invisible behind light, smoky arms extended before him, resting on the table, and yet not resting upon it. Between the table and the arms one quarter of an inch of empty space existed.\\n\\n The Space Ranger said, \"I have come to speak to criminals.\"\\n\\n It was Hennes who broke the sticky silence that followed. He said, in a voice that dripped with husky venom, \"You mean burglars?\"\\n\\n His hand went momentarily to his dark glasses but did not remove them. His fingers shook visibly.\\n\\n The Space Ranger\u0027s voice was a monotone of slow, hollow words. \"It is true I am a burglar. Here are the keys I abstracted from your boots. I need them no longer.\"\\n\\n Slivers of metal flashed across the table toward Hennes, who did not pick them up.\\n\\n The Space Ranger went on, \"But the burglary took place in order to prevent a greater crime. There is the crime of the trusted foreman, for instance, who periodically spent nights in Wingrad City on a one-man search for poisoners.\"\\n\\n Bigman\u0027s little face puckered in glee. \"Hey, Hennes,\" he called, \"sounds like you\u0027re being paged.\"\\n\\n But Hennes had eyes and ears only for the apparition across the table. He said, \"What is the crime in that?\"\\n\\n \"The crime,\" said the Space Ranger, \"of a fast trip out in the direction of the Asteroids.\"\\n\\n \"Why? What for?\"\\n\\n \"Is it not from the Asteroids that the poisoners\u0027 ultimata have come?\"\\n\\n \"Are you accusing me of being behind the food poisoning? I deny it. I demand your proof. That is, if you think you need any proof. Perhaps you think that your masquerade can force me to admit a lie.\"\\n\\n \"Where were you the two nights before the final ultimatum was received?\"\\n\\n \"I will not answer. I deny your right to question me.\"\\n\\n \"I will answer the question for you then. The machinery of the vast poisoning combine is located in the Asteroids, where what is left of the old pirate bands have gathered. The brains of the combine is here at Makian Farms.\"\\n\\n Here Makian rose unsteadily to his feet, his mouth working.\\n\\n The Space Ranger waved him down with a firm motion of his smoky arm and continued, \"You, Hennes, are the go-between.\"\\n\\n Hennes did remove his glasses now. His plump, sleek face, somewhat marred by his red-rimmed eyes, was set into a hard mold.\\n\\n He said, \"You bore me, Space Ranger, or whatever you call yourself. This conference, as I understand it, was for the purpose of discussing means of combating the poisoners. If it is being converted into a forum for the stupid accusations of a play actor, I am leaving.\"\\n\\n Dr. Silvers reached across Bigman to grasp Hennes\u0027s wrist. \"Please stay, Hennes. I want to hear more of this. No one will convict you without ample proof.\"\\n\\n Hennes dashed Silvers\u0027s hand away and rose from his chair.\\n\\n Bigman said quietly, \"I\u0027d love to see you shot, Hennes, which is exactly what you will be if you go out the door.\"\\n\\n \"Bigman is right,\" said Silvers. \"There are armed men outside, with instructions to allow no one to leave without orders from me.\"\\n\\n Hennes\u0027s fists clenched and unclenched. He said, \"I will not contribute another word to this illegal procedure. You are all witnesses that I am being detained by force.\" He sat down again and folded his arms across his chest.\\n\\n The Space Ranger began again, \"And yet Hennes is only the go-between. He is too great a villain to be the real villain.\"\\n\\n Benson said faintly, \"You speak in contradictions.\"\\n\\n \"Only apparently. Consider the crime. You can learn a great deal about a criminal from the nature of the crime he commits. First, there is the fact that few people, comparatively, have died so far. Presumably the criminals could have gained what they wanted more quickly by beginning with wholesale poisonings, instead of merely threatening for six months during which they risked capture and gained nothing. What does this mean? It would seem that the leader somehow hesitates to kill. That is certainly not in character for Hermes. I have obtained most of my information from Williams, who is not among us now, and from him I know that after his arrival at the farm Hermes tried several times to arrange his murder.\"\\n\\n Hennes forgot his resolve. He shouted, \"A lie!\" The Space Ranger went on, unheeding, \"So Hennes would have no compunction against killing. We would have to find someone of gentler mold. Yet what would force an essentially gentle person to kill people he has never seen, who have done him no harm? After all, though an insignificant percentage of Earth\u0027s population has been poisoned, the dead number several hundred. Fifty of them were children. Presumably, then, there is a strong drive for wealth and power which overcomes his gentleness. What lies behind that drive? A life of frustration, perhaps, which has driven him into a morbid hatred of humanity as a whole, a desire to show those who despised him how great a man he really is. We look for a man, then, who might be expected to have an advanced inferiority complex. Where can we find such a one?\"\\n\\n All were watching the Space Ranger now with an intentness that burned in every eye. Something of keenness had returned even to Makian\u0027s expression. Benson was frowning in thought, and Bigman had forgotten to grin.\\n\\n The Space Ranger continued, \"Most important as a clue is what followed the arrival of Williams at the farm. He was at once suspected of being a spy. His story of the poisoning of his sister was easily shown to be false. Hermes, as I have said, was for outright murder. The leader, with his softer conscience, would take another method. He tried to neutralize the dangerous Williams by developing a friendship for him and pretending to unfriendliness with Hennes.\\n\\n \"Let us summarize. What do we know about the leader of the poisoners? He is a man with a conscience who has seemed friendly to Williams and unfriendly to Hennes. A man with an inferiority complex resulting from a life of frustration because he was different from others, less of a man, smaller.... \"\\n\\n There was a rapid movement. A chair was thrust from the table, and a figure backed rapidly away, a blaster in his hand.\\n\\n Benson rose to his feet and yelled, \"Great Space. Bigman!\"\\n\\n Dr. Silvers cried helplessly, \"But-but I was to bring him here as a bodyguard. He\u0027s armed.\"\\n\\n For a moment Bigman stood there, blaster ready, watching each of them out of his sharp little eyes. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/david-starr-space-ranger-lucky-starr-1/page-16.html","bookId":1754,"book":{"id":1754,"title":"David Starr Space Ranger (Lucky Starr #1)","description":"Storyline: David Starr, Space Ranger (Lucky Starr #1) \\n Earth is on the brink of catastrophe.
