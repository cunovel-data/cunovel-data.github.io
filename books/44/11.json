{"id":1203,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"THEY TRAVELED QUICKLY, and in silence, for the first hour. There was the unspoken understanding that it was important to try and cover as much distance as possible. Traveling during the day would not be a terribly pleasant experience with the desert sun beating down on them. Night was the time to cross the sands. Sulu glanced at her every so often to make sure that she was keeping up. She seemed to have no trouble. At one point she stopped, removed her boots, and then continued walking. She actually moved faster barefoot. So much faster, in fact, that she passed him and Sulu quickly became aware that she could probably outdistance him with little trouble. She realized it at about the same time, apparently, and slowed down so that Sulu could keep up. She glanced at him as they drew side by side, and there was a degree of impishness on her face as they trudged up one sand dune and down another. \"You\u0027re very quick,\" he said finally, the first words spoken in over an hour. She stopped and raised the soles of her feet for inspection. They looked hard as shoe leather. \"I do a lot of walking,\" she said. \"So do I. Every morning. Although not barefoot, and not in conditions like this.\" \"I\u0027ve crossed a desert or two in my time,\" she said. \"And what else have you done in your time?\" They got to the crest of a sand dune and Sulu slipped a bit going down it, but righted himself before he could fall over. \"Well?\" he said. She looked at him curiously. \"Well what?\" \"Well what else have you done in your time? What\u0027s your time been spent doing?\" \"This and that.\" \"And whatever it is you were ready to sell to Kelles … does that come under the category of \u0027this\u0027 or \u0027that\u0027?\" She stopped walking and stared at him defiantly. \"Don\u0027t be coy, Sulu. It doesn\u0027t suit you. You want to ask a question, ask it.\" \"All right. What is it you were trying to sell, and from whom did you steal it?\" Her gaze was level and she was quiet for a time. Then she said briskly, \"None of your business.\" He threw his hands up in exasperation. \"Well that\u0027s helpful.\" \"The fact that you have to ask the question means that the answer is pointless.\" \"And the answer is—?\" \"You won\u0027t believe me.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me what I will and won\u0027t believe.\" He stopped walking and waited. \"Well?\" She kept walking. \"I\u0027m not going to tell you.\" \"I\u0027m not moving until you do.\" \"Fine. Don\u0027t move then. To hell with you.\" She kept on going. Sulu stayed exactly where he was, and was annoyed to find that he was admiring the sway of her hips and the way that her shoulder blades stood out against the back of her tight black shirt. Her hair swung pendulum-like as she strode away. She got about a hundred feet, then came to a stop and sighed audibly. Then she turned around and walked back to Sulu, standing there with arms folded and reluctant amusement on her face. \"I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m going.\" \"You mean short-term or long-term?\" She raised an eyebrow in a manner that eerily reminded Sulu of a certain Vulcan. \"The latter depends somewhat on the former.\" \"True enough.\" She sighed. \"Okay. Come on.\" He paused a moment to make sure that he understood her intent, and then he walked alongside her. As they continued their steady pace, Ling Sui licked her lips once—the only indication she gave that she was at all thirsty. \"I\u0027m freelance.\" \"Freelance? Freelance what?\" \"Freelance whatever it takes. Freelance inventor, pilot, researcher, explorer … adventurer, for want of a better term. The technology I had to sell was invented by my current client.\" \"Your current client being—?\" \"My current client being none of your damned business,\" she told him, although she didn\u0027t sound particularly angry when she said it. \"All right. Fair enough.\" They started up another sand dune. \"Go on.\" \"My client had an assistant, name of Taine. I\u0027m sure you remember him; he was trying to kill you a short while ago.\" \"He\u0027s somewhat fresh in my recollections, yes.\" \"Taine stole all the material related to my client\u0027s discovery. All the research, the findings … all of it. This is something one can accomplish when one is in a position of trust, as Taine was … although he\u0027s not anymore, as I\u0027m sure you can surmise. This drove home to my client his vulnerability, not to mention the transitory nature of the exclusivity of discoveries. So he hired me to retrieve it: retrieve years and years\u0027 worth of computations, calculations, test results … more than my client could possibly have endeavored to reproduce simply from memory. Retrieve it … and line up a powerful buyer for it.\" \"If it was stolen, why didn\u0027t he just report it to the authorities?\" She looked at him in amusement. \"You can\u0027t report matters to the authorities when there are questions connected that you\u0027d rather not answer. Not all areas of research are \u0027approved,\u0027 Sulu.\" \"Was he involved with something dangerous?\" \"By dangerous you mean would people become sick or die from it? No, not at all. Sometimes, though, things are forbidden. Once upon a time, it was heresy to suggest that the Earth revolved around the sun. But just because something is forbidden doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t have to investigate it anyway. Sometimes you do what you have to, even if the authorities would frown on it. Do you agree?\" Briefly Sulu\u0027s thoughts flew to the numerous times that James T. Kirk had stretched General Order 1 almost into unrecognizability. And yet somehow things had always managed to work out for the best, Kirk\u0027s instinct unerringly guiding them through the rocky shoals of Starfleet regs. Nor was Kirk unique; Mr. Spock (and who was more respectful of the logic of rules than a Vulcan?) had risked death to fly in the face of General Order 7. But Sulu had never been in that position. He wondered what would happen if someday he was in a command situation and was asked to choose between orders and his sense of what was right and wrong. Indeed, it was only a matter of time before that did happen. He hoped he would do the right thing … or even be able to figure out precisely what the right thing was. Yes … he knew he would figure it out. Because whatever it was, it would be the honorable thing. Right and wrong, rules and regulations—these things could be discussed and analyzed to death and even beyond. But honor was immutable. Honor was known. A question of honor was answered with as much clarity as the North Star. \"Yes … I agree,\" he said. She looked surprised. \"Hmmf. A Starfleet officer agreeing with that philosophy. Again you surprise me, Sulu. So … in any event, that\u0027s why I was brought into this. Because I wouldn\u0027t sit in judgment, and I wouldn\u0027t start quoting regulations or get involved in politics. I\u0027d come in, do the job, and get out.\" She paused. \"Except I didn\u0027t exactly do the job, it seems. I managed to steal the technology back from Taine, set up the meeting place for the sale to occur. And then the whole thing went straight to hell. Not your fault, though. Mine. Only mine.\" \"It was my fault, too. I …\" He paused, and she stopped walking and turned to look at him. \"What\u0027s up with you, anyway?\" she said in that slightly musical voice of hers. \"There\u0027s something going on here, something you\u0027re not telling me. What is it? I\u0027ve been as honest with you as I can . . . .\" \"You\u0027ll laugh.\" \"Maybe,\" she agreed. \"If it\u0027s stupid enough.\" He stopped, sat down on a dune and pulled off his boots. Upending them, he watched sand pour out as he looked around their surroundings. \"Is the entire Sahara like this?\" he asked. \"Oh, no.\" She gestured. \"This erg, for example …\" \"Erg?\" \"Sand dune. It\u0027s only, what? Ten meters high? There\u0027s ergs go as high as two hundred meters.\" At the expression on his face, she added, \"Of course, it\u0027s not like the entire Sahara is nothing but ergs. After all, the damned thing\u0027s nine million square kilometers … as big as the United States. It\u0027s not all sand.\" \"No?\" \"No,\" she said cheerfully. \"Some places it\u0027s pebbles and gravel.\" \"Oh, well … that makes all the difference,\" Sulu acknowledged. \"So … what will I laugh at?\" \"Oh.\" He\u0027d hoped she\u0027d forgotten. \"Uhm … you\u0027re not going to find this easy to believe … but the whole thing back at the city? I thought it was a put-on.\" \"Put-on?\" She shook her head, not understanding. \"I thought …\" He sighed. \"I was visiting with a friend … and I\u0027d been complaining that there was no adventure to be had on Earth. That it couldn\u0027t possibly compare to the kinds of excitement that we encountered in space exploration. And what with the timing of all of this … and the outrageousness, the mysteriousness of it all … I was convinced he\u0027d set it up. Demora is filled with people who are employees, or freelancers who are willing to be hired to perform some sort of bizarre adventure play. They were the evil villains, you were the mystery woman with the vague and exotic background. That\u0027s what I thought was going on here. Up until …\" He paused and looked down again at the stain on his jacket that represented some of the remains of Kelles. \"Well … I know better now.\" \"So when you went after Taine and the others that first time … you thought they were actors.\" He paused, remembering. \"Not when I first approached them, no. I thought they were following you to try and hurt you. It was only later, as matters escalated, that I thought it was faked.\" \"So you tried to help me initially believing that I was in trouble … and eventually, upon discovering your error, you then leaped to the rescue in a shuttle, engaged in a daring high-speed chase across the desert, battled hand to hand with a man who was trying to kill you, then hurled us to safety with a makeshift sled … and now you\u0027re concerned I\u0027ll laugh at you.\" Sulu stared at her. \"Well … I wouldn\u0027t have put it quite that way but, essentially … yes, that\u0027s right.\" And to his utter astonishment she leaned over and kissed him full on the lips. It was brief, sweet, and refreshing, like a summer shower that comes from nowhere, vanishes to the same place, and leaves you feeling invigorated. She looked at him and he would have sworn that the twinkling stars from overhead were reflected in her eyes. \"You are so cute,\" she told him. Then she patted him on the knee. \"Come on. Let\u0027s go.\" \"By all means,\" he said, and pulled his boots back on. She took his hand as they started up the next erg. They made it to the top, slid down the other side, and continued walking, His fingers interlaced with hers as they kept moving, slowly but steadily. Neither of them complained, both remaining stoic about the situation. But as hour piled upon hour, their progress was nowhere near as rapid as either of them would have liked, and the lack of water was starting to get to them. Plus unspoken was the simple fact that time was against them. Sooner or later, the sun would rise. No one was more aware of that than Sulu. As the sun rose the heat would begin to rise as well, the temperature driven upward, going as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. It was incumbent upon them to get as far as they possibly could during the night, but it wasn\u0027t as if they\u0027d already had the most restful of days. As they scaled and then slid down dunes, no discussion passed between them. During the plateaus, however, they would talk. Sulu discussed his youth in San Francisco, and his Starfleet career, which began in physics but then switched to navigation and helm. His family, his friends. And Ling, for her part, listened. She didn\u0027t volunteer much in the way of her own personal history, and when he pressed her she smiled and demurred. \"Oh, come now, Sulu. Don\u0027t you remember? The mystery woman. What good would be served by knowing too much about the mystery woman.\" \"But you\u0027re not really.\" \"Oh, but I am. At least, I am now. I rather like it, I must admit.\" She smiled. \"Understand, I don\u0027t think of myself that way. I\u0027m just a hard worker, with a background that would sound rather mundane if I went into it. But being a \u0027mystery woman,\u0027 well … that\u0027s an honor. Even a responsibility.\" \"How is it a …\" He stopped and pointed. \"Look.\" She followed where he was pointing, certain that they couldn\u0027t possibly be within view of the city. The shuttle had taken them too far, too fast. They couldn\u0027t have covered the distance that quickly. . . . Then she saw it. \"An oasis,\" she said. \"At first I thought it might be a mirage.\" \"Not at night. Come on.\" There were some ninety large oases throughout the Sahara, and many smaller ones. This was definitely one of the smaller ones, too small to support any sort of large settlement. But the vegetation, while not copious, was still lush, and the water was flowing from an underground spring. They drank of it greedily, for although they were nowhere near as dehydrated as they would have been had it been daytime, their thirst was nevertheless a very real thing. Sulu let the water run over his parched lips, splashing it in his face, closing his eyes and letting it run over his head. He wavered slightly and realized that closing his eyes wasn\u0027t the best of ideas; he was that fatigued. He forced them open and looked at Ling Sui. She had removed her shirt, revealing a black halter top beneath. Her arms were muscular, even more so than Sulu would have surmised. He could see the curve of her breasts beneath the halter, they looked small and firm. If she was aware of his gaze moving across her, she gave no indication of it. She soaked the shirt in the small spring and then draped it over herself. \"You didn\u0027t need me,\" he said after a time. She looked up at him questioningly. \"Pardon?\" \"You seem familiar with the Sahara. From the bottoms of your feet it\u0027s clear that you\u0027ve done a ton of walking. I\u0027d wager you\u0027d have no trouble looking at the stars and figuring out which way to go.\" She smiled and looked down. \"If you wagered it, your money would be safe.\" \"Then why … ?\" \"Why?\" She feigned surprise. \"Why, don\u0027t you remember? I\u0027m your mystery woman now.\" He laughed softly. \"Oh, now you scoff,\" she said. \"Obviously you don\u0027t really know anything about it.\" \"I don\u0027t?\" \"No, you don\u0027t.\" She pulled her legs up and wrapped her arms around them. And she sounded very sincere as she said, \"Every man—particularly every man of adventure—should have one mystery woman in his life, Sulu. That woman who enters his sphere like a comet. Who creates her own reality around him and swallows him up in it. Who \u0027gets\u0027 to him, inflaming his senses, heightening the sheer experience of living so that from then on, when he wakes up each morning ever after, the world seems a little different to him because he knows that she\u0027s somewhere out there in it. \"That woman whom he thinks about, wonders about … wonders if, sooner or later, she\u0027ll pop back into his life just as abruptly as she entered it before. With some new adventure in tow, some new villains seeking to do her in. It doesn\u0027t happen, of course, because such things never happen more than once, really. You can\u0027t have a string of mystery women; it\u0027s unfair to all those pathetic wretches who, in fact, never do get a mystery woman. And years into the future, when he murmurs her name in his sleep, his wife asks him about it in the morning and he shrugs and says, \u0027It was just a dream, honey. It\u0027s not supposed to make sense.\u0027\" \"You\u0027ve got my entire life planned out for me, then? You come into it, you disappear from it, and I marry someone else and think of you now and then in fleeting moments?\" She looked at him sadly. \"I hope not.\" They were silent for a time, and then Ling Sui glanced around and said, \"Do you think we should start walking again?\" But she didn\u0027t sound tremendously enthused by the notion. Nor was Sulu for that matter. He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027ve had a rather long day,\" he said wryly. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be all that long until sunrise. And I doubt that we\u0027d luck into another oasis right when the sun\u0027s coming up. But if we stay here …\" \"Then we rest, recuperate, and start walking again tomorrow night.\" She nodded. \"You\u0027re right, that\u0027s probably the way to go.\" He nodded, then removed his jacket, rolling it up into a makeshift pillow that he positioned beneath his head. Ling Sui didn\u0027t seem to need any such contrivance, merely lying back with her head resting on the vegetation, her hands interlaced behind her head. \"Are you married, mystery woman?\" he asked. \"Or affianced, or in some way connected to someone else at the moment?\" \"Oh, come on, Sulu,\" she chided. \"Do I seem like that kind of woman?\" \"I don\u0027t know what kind of woman you seem like. You\u0027re a mystery woman, remember.\" \"Right. That\u0027s right. Forgive me … this rarefied status is still new to me.\" Then, her voice soft and devoid of her cockiness, she said, \"No. No husband. No fiancé. No one. You?\" \"No one,\" he echoed. \"Ever feel lonely?\" \"I have my friends. And I have the stars. We live in a galaxy so teeming with life … and I look up at the stars, knowing there are planets out there with alien life-forms that are likely looking right back at me. With all that, how can one ever be lonely.\" \"Oh, I feel exactly the same way. I\u0027ve done my share of starhopping. Not on par with yours, of course, but I\u0027ve gotten around. Seen a lot of things. Been up to my neck in one thing or another. Frankly, I don\u0027t even have time to be lonely.\" \"Same here.\" \"Ditto.\" \"Couldn\u0027t agree more.\" She paused. \"Ever feel lonely?\" she asked again. \"Yes. A lot. You?\" \"The same.\" \"Any regrets?\" He paused a moment, considering. \"Do you want to wade through the same unconvincing rationalizations, or should we go straight for the truth.\" \"Oh, let\u0027s chance it.\" \"Regrets, yes.\" \"Same here. Although … it\u0027s not too late, you know. You\u0027re relatively young. So am I. We could each decide that\u0027s there more to life than running around and adventuring.\" \"Not too late?\" \"No.\" He gave it some thought and then sighed. \"No, you\u0027re wrong. It\u0027s too late.\" \"I was afraid of that,\" she said. They were quiet for a time more. It was so still, so silent around them, and Sulu became very aware of her breathing … and, curiously, he thought he could hear the steady rhythm of his own heart. . . . \"Why\u0027d you switch?\" she asked. \"Pardon?\" She rolled over, propping her head up on one hand. \"Why did you switch?\" she asked again. \"From physics to helm. Aren\u0027t you just a … a chauffeur with delusions of grandeur?\" He chuckled softly at the metaphor. \"Well, I\u0027m in charge of weapons and tactical as well … plus, helming a starship is a bit more complicated than steering a vehicle.\" \"But that\u0027s not why.\" \"No, it\u0027s not.\" He hadn\u0027t stopped looking at the stars. \"It\u0027s because, as I spent time in the lab, I suddenly came to the realization that, in that part of the service, I\u0027d continue to spend my time in labs. Labs on a science vessel, labs on a starship … didn\u0027t matter. I\u0027d be down in the bowels of the ship somewhere doing reports, making studies, passing answers on to the captain, who\u0027d be up on the bridge doing whatever was necessary for the survival of the ship and crew. \"And I was talking with my mother one day, and I told her what I was learning at the Academy. And maybe she sensed somehow that I wasn\u0027t entirely happy with it. Part of what had drawn me to physics was that my father was a physicist, and so I just felt the inclination to follow in his footsteps. And she said to me—I suspect in hopes of prompting me to stay Earthbound—\u0027I don\u0027t understand why you have to be out in space to be a physicist.\u0027 And I tried to have an answer for that … I think I even muttered something, although it was something clever such as \u0027You wouldn\u0027t understand.\u0027 But the fact was that she was right. There was no reason. Not really. Oh, there were experiments certainly that could only be conducted in space, but … was that sufficient reason? And I realized to me, at least, it wasn\u0027t. \"But helmsman … steering the ship … looking straight ahead and seeing the stars clustered in front of you … that\u0027s what I was really going out there for, Ling. For the stars. To go out and there lose myself in them.\" \"A helmsman who wants to lose himself? Doesn\u0027t sound promising.\" He yawned and said, \"There\u0027s no problem with losing yourself … as long as you can always find your way back.\" \"I suppose you\u0027re right,\" she said. \"I suppose that—\" But the rest of what she said began to haze out to him and, almost before he realized it, he was asleep. He was in that place where waking and dreaming intersect. . . . Stars seemed to float about him, and he was unsure of whether he was at the helm of the Enterprise or staring up into the night skies above the Sahara. It was an odd sensation, because usually one isn\u0027t aware that one is dreaming, and yet here he was, feeling as if the stars were rushing past him as he sped toward some odd destiny. Star clusters were swirling in front of him, surrounded by blackness, and then they seemed to regroup and form the outline of a face … Her face … \"Your mystery woman,\" she said to him, and she brought her lips to his. She tasted so sweet … she tasted like wild abandon, and youth, and adventure, and for bidden fruit that he could not resist here in the garden, and he told her all this, and she laughed. \"Tasted all that before, have you, so you could compare?\" she said teasingly. … And her hands were everywhere, she was everywhere in the dream, in the reality, the stars surrounding them and he had no idea if he was sleeping or awake or both. . . . \"Let this ease both our loneliness, at least for a little while,\" she whispered, her breath warm in his ear, and whether he was sleeping or awake he didn\u0027t care because it felt too good, what she was doing to him, too good, the muscular body moving against his and the heat, God, the heat was … … pounding on him. He sat up, blinking against the sun, suddenly aware that he was baking in it. It was high above him, so high that he thought it might be around noon or so. The growth around him had protected him for a time, but the sun had moved into position so that it was shining down on him now. He rolled over, his joints stiff, and he splashed water on his face from the stream. \"Ling Sui,\" he started to say, and looked up. She wasn\u0027t there. At first it didn\u0027t register on him that she was gone. He thought he was just looking in the wrong direction, but when he rolled over he saw that he was, in fact, alone. He got to his feet, his legs wavering slightly. \"Ling Sui!\" he called again, his voice sounding hoarse. No reply came except the echo of his own voice. No sound except the nothingness of the desert … and the cries of Sulu shouting a name over and over.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28427.html","bookId":44,"book":{"id":44,"title":"上尉的女儿 The Captain\u0027s Daughter","description":"简介： 普希金逝世前一年发表了一部真实而深刻地反映普加乔夫农民起义的长篇小说《上尉的女儿》，这部小说不仅在他的全部创作中占有极重...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201312/06/13-37-09-16-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
