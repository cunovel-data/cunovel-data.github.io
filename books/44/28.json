{"id":1220,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"SULU LAUGHED. Demora was still clutching him, her mind whirling in confusion. But Taine\u0027s claim penetrated the haze. She looked up at Sulu with a mixture of befuddlement and fear, and she was even more puzzled when he started to laugh. Taine had a variety of responses in mind when he dropped the bombshell on Sulu, but that hadn\u0027t been one of them. \"What\u0027s so funny?\" he demanded. \"What\u0027s so funny? You\u0027re a fool, that\u0027s what\u0027s so funny.\" \"I\u0027m not the one who raised the daughter of another man thinking she was my own.\" \"Neither am I. Doctors did a genetic testing on her when she first came to me. She\u0027s mine, Taine. I\u0027m her father; it\u0027s incontrovertible.\" Rogers looked to Taine, reacting with clear surprise. \"You said—\" \"Be quiet,\" he ordered Rogers and looked back to Sulu. \"You\u0027re lying. I know she\u0027s mine.\" \"You\u0027re wrong. What, did you think I would spend all these years without knowing for sure? I\u0027ve known since the first day who her father is. And it\u0027s not you.\" \"You\u0027re lying!\" Taine lashed out with one booted foot. Sulu raised an arm, managing to ward off part of the blow, catching it on his shoulder. He swayed, but didn\u0027t go down. \"She\u0027s mine,\" Taine said in a hoarse whisper. \"I recognized her from the moment I saw her picture on the news broadcasts. You remember … the ones that went out everywhere when Kirk died. And there was Demora, big as life, shown clutching her fallen comrade next to her on the bridge of the Enterprise. The image of her mother, I knew it instantly. And sure enough, her name was reported as Demora Sulu. I laughed over that one, oh, how I laughed.\" He raised his voice, addressing his associates. \"Didn\u0027t we laugh, gentlemen?\" Rogers was looking extremely discomfited, and Sulu couldn\u0027t blame him. Taine was acting more and more erratically, his sanity being called increasingly into question. \"Look, Taine,\" he began. But Taine was paying no attention to him. \"So when I discovered that the Enterprise was going to be in this sector, I put up a distress beacon I\u0027d picked up during my wanderings and programmed it with Chinese, in the hope that her interest would be piqued. It was a long shot, I\u0027ll grant you, but I\u0027ve spent my life taking long shots. And it worked. You can\u0027t argue with success.\" \"Or dementia,\" Sulu shot back. As if Sulu hadn\u0027t spoken, Taine said, \"We captured her, brought her down here, and replaced her with a clone … not quite with the alacrity of your \u0027amusement-park planet,\u0027 but speedily and effectively. Oh, given ten days or so the body would have fallen apart, the fakery revealed. But I was reasonably certain the body would be disposed of, either buried or cremated, so that our little secret remained safe.\" Sulu was silent. \"Well, Captain? Nothing to say?\" \"Only one thing: How long have I been down here?\" \"Oh, under the impression that if you\u0027re gone for too long, someone will send help? I wouldn\u0027t stake too much to that if I were you. They won\u0027t find you down here; we\u0027re too well shielded. But in answer to your question … it\u0027s been precisely fifty-seven minutes. I hope that helps.\" \"Immensely,\" replied Sulu. \"It\u0027s not helping, Commander,\" Chafin said, turning from the science station. \"I\u0027ve boosted the gain to the sensor array, but we\u0027re still not detecting anything.\" \"Incoming hail from the Enterprise,\" said Rand. Anik sighed. \"Well, that was inevitable. On-screen.\" Captain Harriman\u0027s image appeared. \"You\u0027ve been given more than enough time, Excelsior. Where\u0027s Captain Sulu?\" She drummed her long fingers on the armrest for a moment, weighed the options, and decided to go with the truth. \"He\u0027s on the planet\u0027s surface, but we\u0027ve been unable to locate him. No life-form readings, no communication. It is my intention to send down a search party.\" \"Negative,\" Harriman said flatly. \"That will be in direct contravention of Starfleet orders and policy. I submit to you, Commander, the harsh reality that Captain Sulu may very likely already be dead. You weren\u0027t on that planet\u0027s surface, Commander. I was. Whatever happened to Ensign Sulu very likely has happened to her father as well. Perhaps, in his frenzy, he leaped off a cliff. In any event … you will not be sending anyone down after him.\" \"Captain, you are being unreasonable. . . .\" \"Commander, I outrank you, and I have Starfleet\u0027s direct orders behind me. Now … are you going to comply? Be aware that refusal to do so will make you complicit with Captain Sulu\u0027s actions, and there will be severe penalties involved.\" He paused. \"You have a promising career, Commander Anik. I don\u0027t suggest you toss it away now.\" All eyes on the bridge were upon her. Anik didn\u0027t look back at any of them. \"Captain, I regret I cannot comply.\" \"Very well. You\u0027re relieved of command. Who\u0027s the next ranking officer there?\" There was deathly silence, and then Janice Rand rose from the communications console. \"I am. Commander Janice Rand.\" Harriman looked slightly pained. He knew who she was, knew the history that she and Sulu had. \"Great,\" he murmured, as if he knew the answer before he even asked the question. \"Commander Rand … can I expect you to act in accordance with Starfleet regulations and relieve Anik of command?\" Rand didn\u0027t hesitate. \"I regret, sir, that you cannot.\" \"Yes, I surmised that would be the answer,\" he sighed. He stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"Looks like we have a situation on our hands, doesn\u0027t it.\" \"Yes, sir, it does.\" And suddenly as if in a tremendous hurry, Harriman said, \"You have five minutes to reconsider your position. Use it wisely.\" And then the screen blinked off. Anik, Rand and the rest of the bridge crew looked at each other in mild confusion. \"That was rushed,\" said Anik. \"Now what?\" asked Rand. \"Now?\" Anik grinned lopsidedly. \"I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027ll probably start updating my résumé. Apparently it\u0027s time for me to start considering a career in the private sector.\" \"That\u0027s an unnecessarily pessimistic view, Commander,\" said Rand. Anik looked at her skeptically. \"Seems to me, Commander—no offense—that you\u0027re a little old to be engaging in fantasies. What\u0027s the Earth saying? We\u0027ve crossed the Ruby Cam.\" \"Rubicon.\" \"Whatever it is, we\u0027ve crossed it. Continue to try and raise Captain Sulu. Ready transporter room to send down a search—\" And suddenly Docksey shouted, \"Photon torpedo off to starboard!\" She was right. The Starship Enterprise had fired a photon torpedo directly at the Excelsior. \"Red alert! Shields up!\" called Anik, hoping it would be in time. \"All engines, hard to port! Brace for impact!\" The Excelsior responded instantly, shields flaring into existence a split second before the photon torpedo smashed directly into the starboard section of the Excelsior … and shattered harmlessly. \"No impact!\" called Lojur. \"Oh, there was impact, all right,\" said Anik. \"But they removed the warhead.\" \"Son of a bitch was trying to scare us,\" Rand said. From helm, Docksey muttered, \"Well, it worked.\" \"Maintain red alert. Docksey, give us some distance.\" \"Aye, sir. Arm phasers?\" \"Not yet. And not until absolutely necessary.\" Anik shook her head in annoyance. \"Fastest five minutes I ever heard of.\" And suddenly as if in a tremendous hurry, Harriman said, \"You have five minutes to reconsider your position. Use it wisely.\" And then the screen blinked off. \"Five minutes?\" came a voice that sounded like it was choking on fury. Carefully keeping his back to the Admiral, Harriman said, \"Yes, Admiral. Five minutes.\" \"Captain, five minutes or five hundred minutes isn\u0027t going to make a bit of difference. These people are defying you and defying Starfleet. There is no strategic advantage to giving them extra time.\" And now Harriman turned to face his father. \"Strategic advantage?\" he said incredulously. \"Admiral … that\u0027s another starship. One of ours. We\u0027re not at war here.\" \"Oh, yes we are,\" said the admiral stiffly. \"We are at war against disobedience. Against contempt for regulations. Against the theatrics and outright rebellion that James Kirk and the others like him stood for. He spread his philosophies to Captain Sulu, and Sulu gave it to his people. It\u0027s like a disease … a cancer, eating away at our discipline! You see where this leads, Captain? Anarchy! Defiance! Starfleet cannot function if its officers take it into their heads to do whatever the hell they want!\" \"I will handle this in my own way, Admiral,\" Harriman said sharply. The air was electric between them. And then, very softly, very deadly, the admiral said, \"Captain … I am giving you a direct order. I want this situation handled now. Not five minutes from now. Now. Or else.\" Harriman felt the blood draining from his face. \"Is that a threat, Admiral?\" \"Is that a threat? No. This is a threat.\" Blackjack Harriman turned to Chaput and said, \"Helm … load an unarmed photon torpedo … the kind you use for probes. Then target and fire.\" Chaput, stunned, looked to the captain. Captain Harriman was no less stunned. \"What?\" \"You heard me,\" said the admiral evenly. \"It\u0027ll just be a warning shot.\" \"And the next one will be what? For real?\" \"If that\u0027s what it takes,\" said the admiral. He turned and was face-to-face with the captain. \"Don\u0027t make me have to relieve you of duty, Captain.\" The muscles of Harriman\u0027s jaw twitched furiously. \"Helm … carry out the order,\" he said. \"Aye, sir,\" said Chaput, trying to keep the apprehension out of her voice. \"Torpedo locked but not loaded.\" \"Fire,\" said Harriman. \"Torpedo away,\" Chaput said tonelessly. They watched the streak of light blaze toward the Excelsior. The starship tried to get out of the way, but there wasn\u0027t enough time or distance between the vessels. The torpedo collided with the starboard warp strut but, since there was no active warhead in it, it simply shattered against it. \"Their shields are up,\" Dane said from the sensor station. \"Good,\" the admiral said with satisfaction. \"It means they\u0027re taking us seriously.\" \"Apparently this is your game now, Admiral,\" Harriman told him. \"What did you have in mind for the next play?\" Ignoring the sarcasm in Harriman\u0027s tone, Blackjack said, \"Now, Captain … you get to have your five minutes. But it won\u0027t be five minutes of them stalling. It\u0027ll be five minutes of them sweating. You\u0027re no longer dealing from weakness, son. Now you\u0027re dealing from strength.\" \"In some quarters, restraint is considered strength,\" Harriman said. The admiral looked at him. \"There\u0027s no crime handling people with kid gloves, Captain … just as long as they know there\u0027s a fist of iron inside it. And if you don\u0027t have the stomach to deal with this in the proper fashion … then I will.\" On the surface of the planet, the shuttlecraft sat motionless. But now computer commands began to kick over, and the engines of the Galileo began to surge to life. Slowly but steadily, the shuttle rose into the air. Thor stood guard over Sulu and Demora, who were still on the floor exactly as they\u0027d been left. Demora had stopped trembling, and was glaring at Thor balefully. Rogers, meantime, had brought Taine over to another section of the vast room and was talking to him in a low and hurried voice. \"Listen to me, Taine,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve stuck with you through thick and thin, all these years. I always felt I owed you for that time you saved my life back on Castalan Nine. You know that. But between you and me, you haven\u0027t been a hundred percent right ever since the crash in the Sahara. Most times you\u0027re fine … but lately it\u0027s …\" \"What\u0027s your point?\" said Taine. \"The point is, I think you\u0027ve got to take a step back. This Sulu guy was a pain in the ass twenty years ago, and I\u0027m the first to admit that I\u0027m as much for painful and agonizing torture as the next sadist. But there\u0027s no real percentage in vengeance. This whole taunting thing … it\u0027s serving no purpose. And this girl you fixated on: Maybe you thought she was your daughter, and that\u0027s fine. Or maybe she just reminded you of Ling and, deep down, you felt like you wanted to have her for old time\u0027s sake. That\u0027s fine, too. I went along with things this far because you never steered me wrong. But Taine … Sulu\u0027s right. This is crazy. You want to kill them, kill them. You want to indulge yourself with the girl first, then do it. I\u0027ll hold her still if you need me to. But you are way over the edge here. You\u0027re exposing us to unnecessary risks. It\u0027s got to end. So end it.\" \"You want me to end it,\" said Taine. \"That\u0027s right.\" Taine\u0027s hand flew, fast and sharp, and speared Rogers in the throat. Rogers gagged as Taine kicked out, catching him in the pit of the stomach and knocking him flat on his back. Before Rogers could sit up, Taine was standing over him with Sulu\u0027s phaser rifle cradled in his arms. \"You want me to end it? I could end you right now!\" He whirled and aimed the phaser at Sulu and Demora. \"You want them dead, Rogers? Fine! One piece at a time, though! I\u0027ll blast them apart one damned piece at a time!\" The shuttle angled sharply upward, its preencoded course laid in. It reached sufficient height, angled around 180 degrees … and then plunged downward in a nosedive. And Sulu said quietly, in a voice that carried nevertheless, \"She must have meant a hell of a lot to you.\" \"You shut up! You don\u0027t know anything!\" \"I know more than you could possibly believe,\" Sulu said confidently. \"I know all the things you regret. I know what she meant to you. I know that—\" \"I said shut up!\" Taine ordered. He approached Sulu, the phaser rifle aimed squarely at him. Sulu had brought the formidable weapon with him because he\u0027d had no idea what to expect and—since he\u0027d been on his own—he figured he would want to pack as much firepower as possible. Now it seemed as if that was going to be a major mistake. \"I know why you\u0027re doing this,\" Taine continued. \"You hope to make me so mad that I\u0027ll simply blow you out of existence. That\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it. A quick, easy painless death, molecules spreading into oblivion so that you never even feel a thing. Or maybe you think there\u0027s going to be another rescue. Someone will come plunging through the skylight and save you. Well, Captain, in case you haven\u0027t noticed …\" He gestured upward. \"There\u0027s no skylight. So what are you going to do now, eh?\" \"Improvise,\" replied Sulu. And the ceiling exploded overhead. Down, down through the cathedral ceiling smashed the shuttlecraft Galileo. Debris fell like hail as the roar of the shuttlecraft\u0027s engines filled the massive room. Thor looked upward just in time to see a huge piece of masonry plunge toward him. He barely had time to throw up his hands in a vain attempt to ward it off before it fell on him, pinning him. Sulu yanked Demora out of the way of falling rubble as it crashed around them. He heard a phaser whine and, moving more on instinct than anything else, lunged to the left. The phaser crackled over his head as he grabbed up a piece of rock and threw it desperately in Taine\u0027s direction. The rock struck Taine squarely in the temple. He staggered, and the phaser rifle fell to the ground two feet away. Seeing the opportunity, and knowing it might be their only one, Sulu lunged straight toward the rifle as chunks of the ceiling continued to rain down around him. Thor intercepted him. Having shoved his way through the rubble, Thor knocked him back with a swing of his huge forearm. He moved after Sulu, rolling in like a thundercloud. Demora leaped at the rifle and got there just as Taine grabbed it. The powerful weapon was caught between them as they pushed against it and against each other, their mouths drawn back in snarls … his contemptuous, hers fierce. A blast from the phaser rifle ripped loose as Taine\u0027s finger found the trigger. It blew out a section of the wall, pieces of metal flying everywhere. One shard went flying in a deadly arc … and thudded squarely into the chest of Rogers, who had managed to dodge all of the other rubble only to look down and find a huge piece of metal protruding from his rib cage. He sank to his knees, surprised eyes glassing over. The shuttlecraft sat serenely, having arrived at its destination and not programmed with any guidance beyond that. Thor, like the thunder god after which he was named, hammered Sulu. Sulu managed to block a vicious punch that would likely have taken off his head, but a sweep of Thor\u0027s massive fist caught him on the side of his arm. The years had done nothing to diminish Thor\u0027s strength; if anything, he\u0027d gotten stronger and faster. Sulu wished he could say that for himself. Another blast ripped from the phaser rifle, and another. Shots were going all over, blasting machinery apart, sending sparks flying. At the far end, where one of the generators stood, a fire erupted. Taine didn\u0027t seem to notice as he tried to rip the phaser rifle from Demora\u0027s fingers. But she would not let go. She couldn\u0027t have held on to it more strongly if she\u0027d had it in a death grip. He snarled into Demora\u0027s face, \"You should have been mine!\" \"You should have been sucking vacuum at birth!\" shot back Demora, and she yanked at the rifle as hard as she could. Thor stood over Sulu, who was trying to get to his feet. Explosions were rocking the cavern. Thor didn\u0027t seem to care. He had picked up a massive block of rubble, and he was about to raise it over his head and bring it slamming down on Sulu. Only one thing stopped him. Suddenly he didn\u0027t have a head. A blast from the phaser rifle went squarely between his arms. His head vaporized, blown to ashes. The body remained there for a moment, as if knowing something was wrong but not being entirely sure what it might be. And then it sagged as Sulu rolled out of the way, allowing the body to fall to the ground. Then he got to his feet quickly and tried to get to Demora. But he couldn\u0027t get near. The phaser rifle was still blasting in an arc, and it was all he could do to get the hell out of the way. Vats were blasted open, thick liquid pouring out of them … … and bodies. Bodies tumbling out, and Sulu realized with a jolt of horror that they were clones. Clones of Demora. Clones of Taine, or Thor and Rogers. Naked and dripping, growling, trying to figure out where they were, what they were. It was as if Sulu and Demora had stumbled into an old-style horror film. Demora suddenly rolled onto her back, still gripping the rifle, and Taine had no choice but to follow. And Demora, slamming her feet up into his stomach, sent him flying over her head. But she lost her grip on the phaser rifle. He landed in a rapidly growing pool of the white liquid, his grip on the phaser rifle still firm. \"You don\u0027t know anything!\" he howled. \"She was mine! She should have been mine and you ruined everything!\" Sulu didn\u0027t know which \"she\" Taine was referring to precisely, and it didn\u0027t much matter. All he knew was that he and Demora were too far away to do anything except be blown to bits. And that was when a long piece of metal sliced across Taine\u0027s neck. Taine grabbed at it, confused, reacting more to the sudden warmth jetting from him than from any sensation of pain. He turned, staggering, and saw Rogers directly behind him. Rogers, on the verge of death, but still with enough life in him to have pulled the metal from his chest and used it against Taine. Taine tried to speak but his vocal cords wouldn\u0027t function. \"You … you killed us, Taine,\" Rogers gasped out. \"I loved you like a brother … and you killed us … \u0027cause you had to have … what you couldn\u0027t … you idiot …\" He fell forward onto Taine, knocking Taine onto his back. His finger clutched spasmodically onto the trigger of the phaser rifle one last time and it blew skyward, ripping another gaping hole in the ceiling. Huge chunks of rubble, a mountain of it, fell onto both Taine and Rogers, entombing them. All around Sulu and Demora, machinery was erupting, the phaser-rifle blasts having set overloads into motion that could not possibly be stopped. \"Come on!\" Sulu shouted, yanking Demora toward the shuttle. Clones were starting to stagger to their feet, reaching for the two of them. Sulu kicked them aside and he and his daughter leaped into the shuttle. Within seconds the craft had attained altitude and was rocketing upward through the hole, away from the exploding cavern beneath them. They\u0027d gotten halfway up before they realized they weren\u0027t going to make it. Admiral Harriman\u0027s face appeared on the viewscreen of the Excelsior. Without waiting for any niceties, he said flatly, \"I assume you realize that we\u0027re quite serious, Commander.\" \"You\u0027ve made your point abundantly clear, Admiral,\" Anik said. \"I notice you\u0027ve brought your shields and weapons on line.\" \"You\u0027ve left us no choice in the matter, sir.\" Harriman\u0027s face reddened ever so slightly. \"You indeed do have a choice, young woman. Surrender control over your vessel to Enterprise, and follow us to Starbase Nine.\" \"That is not an option, sir,\" said Anik. \"With all due respect … I cannot and will not leave Captain Sulu behind.\" Harriman shook his head. \"It always amuses me when people do that. When they say, \u0027With all due respect,\u0027 right before they say something that\u0027s infuriating. With all due respect to you, Commander, if you choose to fight me on this, we will cripple your ship if necessary and take it in tow. Surrender.\" Anik paused to consider the situation. She looked to the others, looked to Janice Rand … and thought about Captain Sulu. \"Sir,\" she said evenly, \"I will thank you not to utter obscenities.\" \"Obscenities?\" He had no idea what she was talking about. \"Yes, sir. Specifically, the word surrender. We don\u0027t surrender until the last card is played. But then again, that is a grand tradition of the Enterprise, isn\u0027t it, Captain Harriman.\" She made it painfully clear that the latter comment was addressed not to the admiral, but to his son. \"Commander Anik,\" said the admiral in a somewhat patronizing tone, \"you\u0027re playing card games with an old pro. I wouldn\u0027t if I were you. You can\u0027t bluff an old poker man. Surrender. Failure to do so will cause you to be considered a hostile vessel. The consequences will not be pleasant.\" And Janice Rand murmured something. Anik turned to her. \"What?\" \"I was just saying,\" Rand said in a low voice, \"that there\u0027s a more appropriate card game here than poker.\" \"That being?\" \"Well … the polite name for it is \u0027I Doubt You.\u0027 The impolite name. … Well, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 You\u0027ve heard of it.\" And a slow smile spread across Anik\u0027s face. \"Yes. I know the game. Risky, though.\" \"As Captain Kirk once said … risk is our business.\" \"Commander?\" came the admiral\u0027s voice. Anik turned to face the screen. As if the admiral weren\u0027t even on the screen, she said, \"John … when I was second year in the Academy, I happened to eavesdrop on a group of fourth-year cadets.\" The admiral tried to interrupt, saying, \"This is of no relevance, Commander.\" But she ignored him, continuing to talk directly to Captain Harriman. \"They were talking about hopes and dreams … and one of them spoke of wanting to be a starship captain. To command the finest ship in the fleet, with all its proudest traditions. I always remembered him, John, although I never knew who it was … until now. I recognize the voice. So tell me … do you remember those traditions?\" Annoyed and fed up, the admiral broke in and said, \"Last warning: Surrender, or we will fire upon you.\" And Anik smiled defiantly. \"Bull,\" she said. She took a brief moment of pleasure in the admiral\u0027s jawdropping reaction—and a brief moment of prayer that the entire thing wasn\u0027t going to blow up in her face—before turning to Docksey and saying calmly, \"Lieutenant … lower shields.\" Docksey was wide-eyed. \"What?\" \"You heard me.\" Without repeating it, she faced Rand and said, \"Sever communications. There\u0027s nothing more to say.\" Rand nodded and touched her comm panel. The picture of the admiral vanished, replaced by the Enterprise. \"That took a lot of guts, Commander,\" said Rand. \"Thank you.\" \"And it will be an honor working in the prison mines by your side.\" Anik nodded slightly. \"If we live that long,\" she said. Admiral Harriman trembled in outrage. He turned to his son and demanded, \"Did you see that? Did you?\" Before the captain could respond, Magnus suddenly said, \"Captain … their shields are down.\" Blackjack couldn\u0027t believe it. \"The arrogance. This is exactly what I was talking about, Captain. This outright, unabashed contempt! Well, we\u0027re going to make a damned example of them! That\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do! Helm! Lock phasers on the Excelsior.\" Chaput hesitated, looking to Captain Harriman for some sort of cue. But he was completely stoic, staring unflinchingly at the unprotected vessel hanging in space before them. \"Phasers locked,\" she said tonelessly. \"Commander, they\u0027ve locked phasers on us,\" said Lojur. Anik, the picture of tranquillity, sat in the command chair, fingers steepled. \"Well, well … this is getting interesting.\" \"Shall I raise shields?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Any orders?\" \"Yes. Brace yourself.\" \"Have they raised shields?\" demanded the admiral. \"No sir,\" said Magnus. There was a long pause, and then the admiral said softly, \"The unmitigated gall. They think I don\u0027t have the nerve.\" And then, very loudly, he said, \"Helm … fire phasers.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28444.html","bookId":44,"book":{"id":44,"title":"上尉的女儿 The Captain\u0027s Daughter","description":"简介： 普希金逝世前一年发表了一部真实而深刻地反映普加乔夫农民起义的长篇小说《上尉的女儿》，这部小说不仅在他的全部创作中占有极重...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201312/06/13-37-09-16-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
