{"id":1224,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"\"ARE YOU PLANNING to release me anytime soon, Captain,\" said Admiral Harriman in an icy tone. John Harriman stood outside the brig, arms folded, leaning against the wall. \"That depends. I think I\u0027ll debrief you first.\" \"Debrief me. There is nothing you could say, Captain, that could possibly serve as any sort of mitigating circumstance in your upcoming court-martial.\" Harriman proceeded to tell him everything. The admiral\u0027s eyes became wider and wider the further along Harriman got. When the captain was finished, there was a long moment of silence. \"So feel free to court-martial me, Father,\" said Harriman. \"Bring everyone on the Excelsior up on charges too, if you wish. Of course, full testimony will be offered. As it stands, a rescue mission overseen by one Admiral Harriman, aided and abetted by a captain of some renown who is credited with, among other things, saving the Khitomer conference, not to mention the entire Earth … this rescue mission not only recovered a crew woman believed dead—said captain\u0027s daughter—but uncovered the illegal use of forbidden alien cloning technology which the Tholian faction was planning to put to use in schemes of conquest. If, on the other hand, you wish the record to show that said admiral was ready to fire on the famed captain\u0027s unprotected ship and abandon both captain and daughter, allowing the clone technology to continue unabated … well, sir … that is your choice to make.\" Blackjack frowned. \"Think you\u0027ve got me boxed in, don\u0027t you, Captain.\" Harriman nodded. \"Yes, sir, I do.\" \"And you expect me to knuckle under.\" \"No, sir. Merely my fervent hope.\" \"Hunh.\" The admiral scratched his chin. \"If I go along with this … I do not want you to think for one moment I approve of your actions.\" \"Understood.\" \"It\u0027s for the good of the fleet, you understand. And to make you look good.\" \"Yes, sir. I very much appreciate that.\" Anik and Harriman walked toward the Enterprise transporter room. \"So he went along with it,\" she asked. \"Of course he did. My father may be many things, but stupid he is not. Although I tend to think relations will be fairly … strained … between us for a while. But I can live with that. More importantly, Demora can live with that.\" They walked into the transporter room. Anik turned and shook his hand briskly. \"Captain … it\u0027s been an honor.\" \"The same to you, Commander. I believe Captain Sulu will be along with you shortly; he\u0027s just spending a few more moments with Demora.\" \"He\u0027s certainly entitled.\" She stepped up onto the platform. \"Uhm, Commander … one thing,\" he said. \"Yes?\" \"That conversation you eavesdropped on. The one about my talking about honor and tradition and what I wanted from life. I remember having a conversation like that … but how in the world did you recognize or even remember my voice from that one fleeting moment ten years ago?\" \"Oh, that.\" Anik laughed. \"I made that up.\" \"What?\" He gaped at her. \"What?\" \"I made it up. I never overheard you. I\u0027m not even absolutely sure we went to the Academy at the same time.\" \"Then how did you know—?!\" She shrugged. \"I guessed. Because everyone at some point in their fourth year sits around and talks about what they want out of life. So I figured it was worth a shot.\" She winked. \"See you around, Captain.\" Grinning and shaking his head in amazement, Captain John Harriman said, \"Energize.\" Anik of Matern vanished and Harriman walked out of the transporter room, still chuckling. Hikaru and Demora stood on the observation deck, staring out at the stars. \"You know,\" Demora said after a while, \"most people can sit down and clear the air without having to face an impending death by rampaging clones.\" \"We\u0027re not most people,\" said Sulu. \"For instance … why didn\u0027t you tell me you were upset about my going with Chekov up to our new assignment at the time it was happening?\" \"Well … because you\u0027d just saved the Earth by going back in time to get two humpback whales …\" Her voice trailed off and she sighed. \"All right. I see your point.\" \"Demora.\" He turned to her. \"Have you considered requesting a transfer to the Excelsior? I happen to know you\u0027d be favorably received by the captain.\" \"And I\u0027d be worrying the entire time he\u0027d be treating me with favoritism. Either that or he\u0027d be overprotective of me. It doesn\u0027t sound like a good idea.\" \"It did for a moment,\" he sighed. \"Dad …\" She hesitated. \"Did you lie to me? About …\" \"About that I would have taken you in even if I hadn\u0027t been your father? No. No, I wasn\u0027t. Because even if you weren\u0027t mine … you still would have been hers. And that would have been enough.\" He smiled. \"But I\u0027m still glad nonetheless.\" He looked back out at the stars. \"And I\u0027m also relieved … that you weren\u0027t taken from me senselessly. I\u0027ve spent my life trying to steer my way through the galaxy … to understand it. I\u0027d like to think there\u0027s some order to it, some reason that things happen. That would give it a sort of elegance. That it is … at its core … a positive force. After all, Einstein said, \u0027God may be sophisticated, but He is not malicious.\u0027 I\u0027ve always believed very strongly in the truth of that.\" \"Einstein. Hmmm,\" mused Demora. \"What\u0027s wrong.\" \"Well, didn\u0027t he also say that it was impossible to exceed the speed of light?\" This stopped Sulu for a moment. Then he shrugged. \"Well … even Einstein had his off days.\" He turned to her once more and hugged her tightly. \"I love you, Demora.\" \"I love you too, Dad. Don\u0027t be a stranger.\" \"I won\u0027t. Not anymore.\" He released her, reluctantly, and started to head for the door when Demora said, \"Oh, and Dad?\" \"Yes?\" \"I stopped by my quarters earlier … and there was mail from you. Just … a chatty letter. You don\u0027t usually send chatty letters. What prompted that?\" He smiled. \"Just thinking of you, sweetheart. Just thinking of you.\" \"Well it was nice. Keep doing it.\" \"Same to you, sweetheart. Same to you.\" He walked out of the observation deck, leaving Demora to gaze at the stars.
