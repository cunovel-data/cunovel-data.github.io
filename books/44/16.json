{"id":1208,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"WHEN THE DOOR to Sulu\u0027s apartment slid open, Chekov found himself staring at a young Asian girl in a blue dress. Reflexively he glanced at the apartment number on the assumption that he was at the wrong place. But a quick check proved that he was where he was supposed to be. \n \n \"Is Meester Sulu here?\" he asked. \n \n She nodded but didn\u0027t step aside. \"Who are you?\" \n \n \"Pavel Chekov. Who are you?\" \n \n \"Demora.\" \n \n \"Demora, like the city?\" \n \n \"Just like.\" \n \n \"Vell … most unusual. I am a friend of Sulu\u0027s. Are you?\" \n \n She appeared to consider it. \"The jury\u0027s still out on that, frankly.\" \n \n He was surprised by her apparent erudition. Then again, Chekov didn\u0027t have a great deal of experience with children, so he wasn\u0027t entirely certain what to expect. \n \n \"May I come in?\" \n \n She stepped aside, giving him room to enter. \n \n He\u0027d always liked Sulu\u0027s apartment … not that Sulu had a great deal of time to spend there, what with being gone for years at a time. Furnished in dark browns, with real wood furniture (lord only knew where Sulu had acquired it). His antique weapons collection, ranging from swords to firearms, was secured behind plexi cabinets. Pictures or portraits of his various ancestors hung on the walls. Sulu was fairly big on families, and could trace his ancestry back centuries. \n \n \"Vere is Sulu, do you know?\" \n \n She chucked a finger. \"In the kitchen. Making dinner.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll just go talk to him then.\" \n \n \"Fine,\" said Demora with a shrug. She moved over to a couch and sank down into the cushion. \n \n Chekov found Sulu in the kitchen. \"So … vat mysterious and exotic dish are you preparing?\" \n \n Sulu was busy scooping something from a pot and pouring it over rolls. \"Chili,\" he said. \"It\u0027s what Demora wanted.\" \n \n \"Ah, Demora. Your sentinel at the gate. Interesting little girl. She\u0027s … vat? Eleven? Twelve?\" \n \n \"Just turning seven.\" \n \n \"She seems older.\" \n \n \"Well, that\u0027s appropriate. I feel older.\" \n \n \"So who is she? Niece?\" \n \n \"Daughter.\" \n \n \"Whose daughter?\" \n \n Sulu stared at him. \"Mine.\" \n \n It was clear that Chekov was having trouble digesting the information. \"I\u0027m sorry … vat?\" \n \n \"She\u0027s my daughter.\" \n \n Chekov looked in the direction of the living room, where Demora was seated, and then back to Sulu. He looked stunned. \"Your … daughter.\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Your daughter. Your daughter?\" \n \n Sulu put the plates down, making no attempt to hide his impatience. He spoke in a low tone to keep their voices from reaching Demora. \"Are we going to move past this sentence anytime soon?\" \n \n \"You have a daughter?\" Chekov whispered. \"And you never mentioned her to me?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t know! I didn\u0027t know until a few hours ago.\" \n \n \"Do you know who the mother is?\" \n \n \"Of course I know who the mother is.\" \n \n \"Oh, now you say \u0027Of course.\u0027 Considering you didn\u0027t know the child existed, the idea of you not knowing who the mother is doesn\u0027t seem all that farfetched.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s Ling Sui. You remember her.\" \n \n \"Of course I remember her. The woman from …\" And then he thudded his hand against his forehead. \"Of course. From Demora. I should have realized it vasn\u0027t simply coincidence.\" He hesitated. \"So … so vat do you do now?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Sulu in exasperation. \"She has no other relatives but me. She\u0027s just lost her mother. She doesn\u0027t seem especially interested in me. And I\u0027m scheduled to ship out with the Bozeman.\" \n \n \"Does she know that?\" \n \n \"She knows it, yes.\" \n \n \"Vell, perhaps the reason she\u0027s not especially interested is because she doesn\u0027t vant to make the emotional investment in someone who is leaving.\" \n \n Sulu transferred the dishes onto a serving tray. \"Since when are you the great child psychiatrist?\" \n \n \"Since ven are you a father?\" \n \n Sulu sighed. \"All right. Touché.\" \n \n As he started to head into the dining room, Chekov stopped him and said, \"Uhm … you didn\u0027t mention to me at the time that you and Ling Sui …\" \n \n \"It was just once.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s all it takes.\" \n \n \"So I\u0027ve heard,\" said Sulu. \n \n \n \n The meal didn\u0027t go precisely as planned. \n \n For one thing, Chekov didn\u0027t plan for himself and Demora to hit it off as well as they did. He had grown accustomed to thinking of children as odd, separate creatures, rather than simply small humans. Beings with their own rules and own manner of communication to which no adult could be privy. \n \n Demora was quite the opposite. She was, he suspected, very much her mother\u0027s daughter. She spoke with intelligence and education about a startling number of topics, ranging from archaeology to the present condition of Federation politics. Chekov found himself becoming quite fond of her during his visit, and he suspected that Demora felt likewise. \n \n Sulu, for his part, kept his own counsel. His gaze would dart from one to the other as they chatted. Chekov interacted with Demora with such ease that Sulu felt torn. On the one hand he was pleased that they were hitting it off so well. On the other hand … he was a little jealous. \n \n But he realized why it was that Chekov felt so at ease with her. It was because he was going to be able to leave. This was Sulu\u0027s problem, Sulu\u0027s situation, and Chekov was just a visitor to it. He could get to know Demora as a person, chat with her, laugh with her … and Sulu got to worry about what in hell he was going to do next. \n \n Chekov stayed late into the evening, regaling Demora with stories about his and Sulu\u0027s time together in the service. A couple of times Sulu tried to hush him up, but Chekov was not easy to stop. Each anecdote would remind him of another, and he\u0027d say with growing excitement, \"And then there vas the time …\" \n \n The hour grew later and later, and finally Sulu said, \"Demora … I really think it\u0027s time for bed. I showed you where the guest bedroom is. . . .\" \n \n \"That\u0027s because I\u0027m a guest?\" \n \n He looked from Demora to Chekov and back again. Clearing his throat, he said, \"That\u0027s … just what I\u0027m in the habit of calling it, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s early for me still.\" \n \n \"Well, I think it\u0027s time you went to bed.\" \n \n She squared her shoulders and said, \"Mother lets me st …\" \n \n And then she caught herself, speaking of her mother in the present tense. It was a slip that had a very visible effect on her, and she looked downcast. It was the first time since he\u0027d met her that he\u0027d seen anything from her acknowledging her loss. She certainly pulled herself together quickly, however, as she said, \"All right. Good night then.\" She turned and walked briskly away toward the rear of the apartment, and Sulu had the feeling—probably legitimate—that the reason she retreated so quickly was because she didn\u0027t want him to see her cry. \n \n Chekov leaned over and said to Sulu in a low voice, \"She\u0027s a great kid, isn\u0027t she?\" \n \n \"Oh … fabulous,\" Sulu said. \"So how do you suggest I handle this?\" \n \n \"Vell—\" Chekov gave it a moment\u0027s thought. \"—you could try and talk Starfleet into letting you bring her along.\" \n \n \"You mean on the Bozeman? Against regs. Never happen.\" He looked down, drumming his fingers. \"I\u0027m … going to make arrangements.\" \n \n \"Vat kind? You\u0027ll leave her vith your family?\" \n \n \"There are schools. I\u0027ve done some checking. Boarding schools and such that will take care of the child year round. Educate her, feed her. That would be best, I think.\" \n \n \"Vile you\u0027re off exploring the galaxy,\" said Chekov. \n \n \"You make it sound trivial.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t mean to,\" said Chekov. \"And you know I don\u0027t feel that vay. I\u0027m just saying …\" \n \n \"What? What are you saying?\" \n \n He raised his eyes and studied his longtime friend. \"I\u0027m saying that here\u0027s a child who vill have lost her mother and never really gotten to know her father. And that\u0027s a lousy vay to grow up.\" \n \n \"Oh really. How do you know?\" \n \n \"Because that\u0027s how I grew up.\" \n \n Sulu said nothing for a moment, then went back to tapping his fingers on the coffee table in front of them. \"You turned out okay,\" he said after a time. \n \n \"Perhaps. But maybe I could have turned out better. I\u0027ll never know.\" \n \n \"And if I leave her, she\u0027ll never know. Is that what you\u0027re saying?\" Sulu rose, looking down at Chekov. \"What are you telling me, Pav? That I should quit? Turn down the first-officer position? Walk away from the thing I know most about in the galaxy so that I can try being a father to an instant family, something about which I assure you I know absolutely nothing? Chekov … it\u0027s crazy. It wouldn\u0027t do her any good, and it certainly wouldn\u0027t do me any good.\" \n \n \"Are you sure?\" \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027m sure!\" \n \n \"Then I suppose there\u0027s nothing more to say.\" \n \n \"Apparently not.\" \n \n Sulu sat back down. It had never seemed so quiet in the apartment before. It was as if the absence of noise had become an entity unto itself. \n \n \"It\u0027s just ironic, that\u0027s all,\" Chekov finally said. \n \n \"What is?\" \n \n \"Vell … years ago, you were telling me how life on Earth couldn\u0027t be exciting. How there was no adventure. And then you were pulled into the entire business vit Ling Sui, and you thought you had found adventure. But that was only a few days. There is no greater adventure than raising a child.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re speaking from experience, I gather,\" he said sarcastically. \n \n \"I vish. Just gut instinct. The same instinct that tells me leaving her behind couldn\u0027t be right.\" \n \n \"Maybe you\u0027d feel differently if the situations were reversed.\" \n \n \"Maybe,\" agreed Chekov. \"But … they\u0027re not. And so I don\u0027t.\" \n \n \"What do you want from me, Chekov?\" Sulu said in exasperation. \"What do you expect me to do? Have some sudden burst of paternal affection that I never had before? Look at this child who is, to all intents and purposes, a stranger to me, and feel so protective of her that I reorder my life around her? Chekov, I … I have responsibilities …\" \n \n \"Yes. You do,\" said Chekov sharply. \"And vun of them is in the \u0027guest bedroom\u0027 right now. So the only question is: Vat are you going to do about it?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m going to do right by her,\" Sulu said. \"It just may be that you and I have different definitions of what\u0027s right.\" \n \n \"Actually,\" Chekov replied, \"I don\u0027t think ve do. Ve simply von\u0027t both admit to it, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28432.html","bookId":44,"book":{"id":44,"title":"上尉的女儿 The Captain\u0027s Daughter","description":"简介： 普希金逝世前一年发表了一部真实而深刻地反映普加乔夫农民起义的长篇小说《上尉的女儿》，这部小说不仅在他的全部创作中占有极重...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201312/06/13-37-09-16-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
