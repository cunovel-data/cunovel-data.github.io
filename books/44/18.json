The sun was still just in the process of coming up over the horizon, as it usually was during their early-morning runs. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the early days, when Demora had wanted to run beside him, he\u0027d had to completely alter his route to accommodate her. But over the years, as she\u0027d approached her teen years, she\u0027d had less and less trouble keeping up with him. Consequently he\u0027d started going back to his old running paths. She\u0027d continued to keep up with him, and he started to foresee a time when it would be all he could do to keep up with her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You want to come to the Academy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I said.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her long hair swung across the small of her back like a pendulum. They were both wearing T-shirts and shorts as she displayed her ability to maintain pace with her father. \\n\\n \\n\\n What Demora wasn\u0027t was tall … a source of great frustration to her, although Sulu kept assuring her that she was in for a growth spurt. Demora would teasingly ask him if he was anticipating a growth spurt for himself, and indeed would occasionally gibe him by calling him Tiny. She meant it affectionately, and he let her get away with it, although he swore that anyone else who ever tried to call him that would sorely regret it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, her lack of height made her appear, at first glance, much younger than she was. Her face still had the softness of childhood. Fully dressed, she looked preadolescent. However, in the sweaty shirt plastered to her chest and the shorts, and the shorts revealing legs like those of a young colt, there was no mistaking the fact that she was a youthful woman on the cutting edge of maturity. Sulu noticed young men\u0027s eyes turning these days as they jogged along, and he had a sneaking suspicion that he wasn\u0027t the one being sized up. \\n\\n \\n\\n They slowed to a stop at a street corner. Sulu started to stretch, massaging a muscle that was cramping. \"You\u0027ve never asked to before. In fact, the first time I mentioned it, you showed such disinterest I never brought it up again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She shrugged (some things never changing). \"I didn\u0027t think you really wanted me to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He gaped at her. But then he thought better of his first reaction, because if there was one thing he\u0027d come to learn, it was never to accept anything Demora said or did at face value. It had been a long and hard lesson for him. He was used to dealing with adults … and outspoken adults, at that, such as Leonard McCoy or Pavel Chekov. People who told you exactly where they stood. \\n\\n \\n\\n Demora wasn\u0027t always as forthcoming. This had worried him at first, but Sulu—being thorough—had researched the subject. He\u0027d read everything he could get his hands on, from recent treatises on child rearing, all the way back to material written centuries before. He remembered a confusing conversation he\u0027d had with Chekov, wherein Sulu had been quoting certain philosophies on parenting and Chekov had asked him who was the authority Sulu was using. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Spock,\" Sulu had told him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Chekov had looked exceedingly confused. \"Meester Spock? Vat does he know about children?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Dr. Spock.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A doctor?\" Chekov was even more befuddled. \"Ven did he become a doctor? Does Dr. McCoy know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In any event, Sulu had learned not to believe the first thing Demora said … or, for that matter, even the second or third necessarily. Speaking with any child was less like a normal conversation and more like peeling an onion: many layers to slice through to get to the core, and not a few tears shed along the way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You thought I didn\u0027t want you to? Demy … come on. You couldn\u0027t have thought that. I\u0027ve told you about it often enough. Encouraged you. You\u0027ve heard Chekov and me discuss the old days whenever he comes over. So how could you possibly think that I didn\u0027t want to share it with you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Demora had her foot placed flat against a building and was stretching to touch her toes. She paused and looked to him. \"Truth?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Beats lies.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned and leaned against the building, her arms folded across her budding breasts. \"I\u0027ve been hearing about Starfleet for so long, and how wonderful it is … I\u0027ve almost been afraid of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Afraid of it?\" He said it half with a laugh, unsure of what she could possibly be talking about. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What if I visit the Academy with you … meet the cadets, sit in on a class … and I find the whole thing … I don\u0027t know. Dull. Maybe the cadets will be jerks, or the subject matter will bore me stiff.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Demy! It\u0027s a visit, not a career choice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s stepping into your world for the first time. Oh, I certainly was off-planet enough with Mother. But it\u0027s … it\u0027s different somehow. I don\u0027t know why, but it just … is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But now you want to come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve just been doing a lot of thinking lately. I miss Chekov, for one thing. He sends his letters from the Reliant, but it\u0027s not the same. It couldn\u0027t be. And also there\u0027s …\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, then,\" Sulu said. \"How about today?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked surprised. \"Today?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not today?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No reason not to. I just meant … some time in the future.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Two hours from now is the future, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s the wonderful thing about the future. It\u0027s whenever you want it to be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Okay. Fine. That would be … fine,\" said Demora. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Demora … promise me something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, Dad. What?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll stay out of trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dad!\" She looked at him accusingly. \"When have I ever …?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s not cite chapter and verse, all right?\" he warned. \"You know very well the number of times I\u0027ve heard it from your teachers about your knack for getting in over your head. I want you to swear to me, on your honor, that you\u0027ll stay out of trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure. Whatever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want \u0027whatever.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, I swear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On your honor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On my honor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n He frowned. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28434.html","bookId":44,"book":{"id":44,"title":"上尉的女儿 The Captain\u0027s Daughter","description":"简介： 普希金逝世前一年发表了一部真实而深刻地反映普加乔夫农民起义的长篇小说《上尉的女儿》，这部小说不仅在他的全部创作中占有极重...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201312/06/13-37-09-16-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
