{"id":66140,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"It was Harley. His mouth was a ragged hole above his goatee. I could see his yellow teeth. He was holding a Para Ordnance P14 in his right hand. The P14 is a solid Canadian-made copy of the Colt 1911 and it was way too heavy for him. His wrists were thin and weak. He would have been better off with a Glock 19, like Duffy\u0027s.\n \"Saw the lights were on,\" he said. \"Thought I\u0027d come in and check.\"\n Then he looked straight at me.\n \"I guess Paulie screwed up,\" he said. \"And I guess you faked his voice when Mr. Xavier called you on the phone.\"\n I looked at his trigger finger. It was in position. I spent half a second mad at myself for letting him walk in unannounced. Then I moved on to working out how to take him down. Thought: Villanueva is going to yell at me if I take him down before we ask about Teresa.\n \"You going to introduce me around?\" he said.\n \"This is Harley,\" I said.\n Nobody spoke.\n \"Who are these other people?\" Harley asked me.\n I said nothing.\n \"We\u0027re federal agents,\" Duffy said.\n \"So what are you all doing in here?\" Harley asked.\n He asked the question like he was genuinely interested. He was wearing a different suit. It was shiny black. He had a silver tie under it. He had showered and washed his hair. His pony tail was secured by a regular brown rubber band.\n \"We\u0027re working in here,\" Duffy said.\n He nodded. \"Reacher has seen what we do to government women. He\u0027s seen it with his own eyes.\"\n \"You should jump ship, Harley,\" I said. \"It\u0027s all coming apart now.\"\n \"You think?\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"See, we don\u0027t get that feeling from the computers. Your friend and mine in the body bag, she didn\u0027t tell them nothing yet. They\u0027re still waiting on her first report. Matter of fact, most days it seems like they\u0027ve forgotten about her altogether.\"\n \"We\u0027ve nothing to do with computers.\"\n \"Even better,\" he said. \"You\u0027re freelance operators, nobody knows you\u0027re here, and I got you all covered.\"\n \"Paulie had me covered,\" I said.\n \"With a gun?\"\n \"With two.\"\n His eyes flicked down for a second. Then back up.\n \"I\u0027m smarter than Paulie,\" he said. \"Put your hands on your heads.\"\n We put our hands on our heads.\n \"Reacher\u0027s got a Beretta,\" he said. \"I know that for sure. I\u0027m guessing there are two Glocks in the room as well. Most likely a 17 and a 19. I want to see them all on the floor, nice and slow, one at a time.\"\n Nobody moved. Harley shaded the P14 toward Duffy.\n \"The woman first,\" he said. \"Finger and thumb.\"\n Duffy slid her left hand under her jacket and dragged her Glock out, pinched between her finger and thumb. She dropped it on the floor. I moved my arm and started my hand toward my pocket.\n \"Wait,\" Harley said. \"You\u0027re not a trustworthy character.\"\n He stepped forward and reached up and pressed the P14\u0027s muzzle into my lower lip, right where Paulie had hit me. Then he reached down with his left hand and burrowed in my pocket. Came out with the Beretta. Dropped it next to Duffy\u0027s Glock.\n \"You next,\" he said to Villanueva. He kept the P14 where it was. It was cold and hard. I could feel the muzzle\u0027s pressure on my loose teeth. Villanueva dropped his Glock on the floor. Harley raked all three guns behind him with his foot. Then he stepped backward.\n \"OK,\" he said. \"Now get over here by the wall.\"\n He wheeled us around until he was next to the crates and we were lined up against the back wall.\n \"There\u0027s one more of us,\" Villanueva said. \"He isn\u0027t here.\"\n Mistake, I thought. Harley just smiled.\n \"So call him,\" he said. \"Tell him to come on down.\"\n Villanueva said nothing. It felt like a dead end. Then it turned into a trap.\n \"Call him,\" Harley said again. \"Right now, or I\u0027ll start shooting.\"\n Nobody moved.\n \"Call him, or the woman gets a bullet in the thigh.\"\n \"She\u0027s got the phone,\" Villanueva said.\n \"In my purse,\" Duffy said.\n \"And where\u0027s your purse?\"\n \"In the car.\"\n Good answer, I thought.\n \"Where\u0027s the car?\" Harley asked.\n \"Close by,\" Duffy said.\n \"The Taurus next to the stuffed animal place?\"\n Duffy nodded. Harley hesitated.\n \"You can use the phone in the office,\" he said. \"Call the guy.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know his number,\" Duffy said.\n Harley just looked at her.\n \"It\u0027s on my speed dial,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t have it memorized.\"\n \"Where\u0027s Teresa Daniel?\" I asked.\n Harley just smiled. Asked and answered, I thought.\n \"Is she OK?\" Villanueva said. \"Because she better be.\"\n \"She\u0027s fine,\" Harley said. \"Mint condition.\"\n \"You want me to go get the phone?\" Duffy asked.\n \"We\u0027ll all go,\" Harley said. \"After you put these crates back in order. You messed them up. You shouldn\u0027t have done that.\"\n He stepped up next to Duffy and put the muzzle of his gun to her temple.\n \"I\u0027ll wait right here,\" he said. \"And the woman can wait here with me. Like my own personal life insurance policy.\"\n Villanueva glanced at me. I shrugged. I figured we were nominated to do the quartermaster work. I stepped forward and picked up the hammer from the floor. Villanueva picked up the lid from the first Grail crate. Glanced at me again. I shook my head just enough for him to see. I would have loved to bury the hammer in Harley\u0027s head. Or his mouth. I could have solved his dental problems permanently. But a hammer was no good against a guy with a gun to a hostage\u0027s head. And anyway, I had a better idea. And it would depend on a show of compliance. So I just held the hammer and waited politely until Villanueva had the lid in place over the fat yellow missile tube. I butted it with the heel of my hand until the nails found their original holes. Then I hammered them in and stood back and waited again.\n We did the second Grail crate the same way. Lifted it up and piled it back on top of the first one. Then we did the RPG-7s. Nailed down the lids and stacked them exactly like we had found them. Then we did the VAL Silent Snipers. Harley watched us carefully. But he was relaxing a little. We were compliant. Villanueva seemed to understand what we were aiming for. He had caught on fast. He found the lid for the Makarov crate. Paused with it halfway into position.\n \"People buy these things?\" he said.\n Perfect, I thought. His tone was conversational, and a little puzzled. And professionally interested, just like a real ATF guy might be.\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t they buy them?\" Harley said.\n \"Because they\u0027re junk,\" I said. \"You ever tried one?\"\n Harley shook his head.\n \"Let me show you something,\" I said. \"OK?\"\n Harley kept the gun pressed hard against Duffy\u0027s temple. \"Show me what?\"\n I put my hand in the crate and came out with one of the pistols. Blew wood shavings off it and held it up. It was old and scratched. Well used.\n \"Very crude mechanism,\" I said. \"They simplified the original Walther design. Ruined it, really. Double-action, like the original, but the pull is a nightmare.\"\n I pointed the gun at the ceiling and put my finger on the trigger and used just my thumb on the back of the butt to exaggerate the effect. Pincered my hand and pulled the trigger. The mechanism grated like a balky stick shift in an old car and the gun twisted awkwardly in my grip.\n \"Piece of junk,\" I said.\n I did it again, listening to the bad sound and letting the gun twist and rock between my finger and thumb.\n \"Hopeless,\" I said. \"No chance of hitting anything unless it\u0027s right next to you.\"\n I tossed the gun back into the crate. Villanueva slid the lid into position.\n \"You should be worried, Harley,\" he said. \"Your reputation won\u0027t be worth shit if you put junk like this on the street.\"\n \"Not my problem,\" Harley said. \"Not my reputation. I just work here.\"\n I hammered the nails back in, slowly, like I was tired. Then we started on the AKSU-74 crate. The old submachine guns. Then we did the AK-74s.\n \"You could sell these to the movies,\" Villanueva said. \"For historical dramas. That\u0027s about all they\u0027re good for.\"\n I hammered the nails into position and we stacked the crate with the others until we had all of Bizarre Bazaar\u0027s imports back into a neat separate pile, just like we had found them. Harley was still watching us. He still had his gun at Duffy\u0027s head. But his wrist was tired and his finger wasn\u0027t hard on the trigger anymore. He had let it slide upward to the underside of the frame, where it was helping take the weight. Villanueva shoved the Mossberg crate across the floor toward me. Found the lid. We had only opened one.\n \"Nearly done,\" I said.\n Villanueva slid the lid into position.\n \"Wait up,\" I said. \"We left two of them on the table.\"\n I stepped across and picked up the first Persuader. Stared at it.\n \"See this?\" I said to Harley. I pointed at the safety catch. \"They shipped it with the safety on. Shouldn\u0027t do that. It could damage the firing pin.\"\n I snicked the safety to fire and wrapped the gun in its waxed paper and burrowed it deep down into the foam peanuts. Stepped back for the second one.\n \"This one\u0027s exactly the same,\" I said.\n \"You guys are going out of business for sure,\" Villanueva said. \"Your quality control is all over the place.\"\n I set the safety to fire and stepped back toward the crate. Pivoted off my right foot like a second baseman lining up a double play and pulled the trigger and shot Harley through the gut. The Brenneke round sounded like a bomb going off and the giant slug cut Harley in half, literally. He was there, and then suddenly he wasn\u0027t. He was in two large pieces on the floor and the warehouse was full of acrid smoke and the air was full of the hot stink of Harley\u0027s blood and his digestive system and Duffy was screaming because the man she had been standing next to had just exploded. My ears were ringing. Duffy kept on screaming and danced away from the spreading pool at her feet. Villanueva caught her and held on tight and I racked the Persuader\u0027s slide and watched the door in case there were any more surprises coming at us. But there weren\u0027t. The warehouse structure stopped resonating and my hearing came back and then there was nothing except silence and Duffy\u0027s fast loud breathing.\n \"I was standing right next to him,\" she said.\n \"You aren\u0027t standing right next to him now,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the bottom line.\"\n Villanueva let go of her and stepped over and bent down and picked up our handguns from where Harley had kicked them. I took the second loaded Persuader out of the crate and unwrapped it again and clicked the safety on.\n \"I really like these,\" I said.\n \"They seem to work,\" Villanueva said.\n I held both shotguns in one hand and put my Beretta in my pocket.\n \"Get the car, Terry,\" I said. \"Somebody\u0027s probably calling the cops right now.\"\n He left by the front door and I looked at the sky through the window. There was plenty of cloud, but there was still plenty of daylight, too.\n \"What now?\" Duffy said.\n \"Now we go somewhere and wait,\" I said.\n I waited more than an hour, sitting at my desk, looking at my telephone, expecting Kohl to call me. She had timed the drive out to MacLean at thirty-five minutes. Starting from the Georgetown University campus might have added five or ten, depending on traffic. Assessing the situation at Quinn\u0027s house could have added another ten. Taking him down should have taken less than one. Cuffing him and putting him in the car should have taken another three. Fifty-nine minutes, beginning to end. But a whole hour passed and she didn\u0027t call.\n I started to worry after seventy minutes. Started to worry badly after eighty. Dead on ninety minutes I scared up a pool car and hit the road myself.\n Terry Villanueva parked the Taurus on the patch of broken blacktop outside the office door and left the engine running.\n \"Let\u0027s call Eliot,\" I said. \"Find out where he went. We\u0027ll go wait with him.\"\n \"What are we waiting for?\" Duffy said.\n \"Dark,\" I said.\n She went out to the idling car and got her bag. Brought it back. Dug out her phone and hit the number. I timed it out in my head. One ring. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.\n \"No answer,\" Duffy said.\n Then her face brightened. Then it fell again.\n \"Gone to voice mail,\" she said. \"Something\u0027s wrong.\"\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" I said.\n \"Where to?\"\n I looked at my watch. Looked out the window at the sky. Too early.\n \"The coast road,\" I said.\n We left the warehouse with the lights off and the doors locked. There was too much good stuff in it to leave it open and accessible. Villanueva drove. Duffy sat next to him in the front. I sat in the back with the Persuaders on the seat beside me. We threaded our way out of the harbor area. Past the lot where Beck parked his blue trucks. Onto the highway, past the airport, and south, away from the city.\n We came off the highway and struck out east on the familiar coast road. There was no other traffic. The sky was low and gray and the wind off the sea was strong enough to set up a howling around the Taurus\u0027s windshield pillars. There were drops of water in the air. Maybe they were raindrops. Maybe it was sea spray, lashed miles inland by the gale. It was still way too light. Too early.\n \"Try Eliot again,\" I said.\n Duffy took her phone out. Speed-dialed the number. Put the phone to her ear. I heard six faint rings and the whisper of the voice mail announcement. She shook her head. Clicked the phone off again.\n \"OK,\" I said.\n She twisted around in her seat.\n \"You sure they\u0027re all out at the house?\" she said.\n \"Did you notice Harley\u0027s suit?\" I said.\n \"Black,\" she said. \"Cheap.\"\n \"It was as close as he could get to a tux. It was his idea of evening wear. And Emily Smith had a black cocktail dress ready in her office. She was going to change. She already had her smart shoes on. I think there\u0027s going to be a banquet.\"\n \"Keast and Maden,\" Villanueva said. \"The caterers.\"\n \"Exactly,\" I said. \"Banquet food. Eighteen people at fifty-five dollars a head. Tonight. And Emily Smith made a note on the order. Lamb, not pork. Who eats lamb and not pork?\"\n \"People who keep kosher.\"\n \"And Arabs,\" I said. \"Libyans, maybe.\"\n \"Their suppliers.\"\n \"Exactly,\" I said again. \"I think they\u0027re about to cement their commercial relationship. I think all the Russian stuff in the crates was some kind of a token shipment. It was a gesture. Same with the Persuaders. They\u0027ve demonstrated to each other that both sides can deliver. Now they\u0027re going to break bread together and go into business for real.\"\n \"At the house?\"\n I nodded. \"It\u0027s an impressive location. Isolated, very dramatic. And it\u0027s got a big dining table.\"\n He turned the windshield wipers on. The glass streaked and smeared. It was sea spray, whipping horizontally off the Atlantic. Full of salt.\n \"Something else,\" I said.\n \"What?\"\n \"I think Teresa Daniel is part of the deal,\" I said.\n \"What?\"\n \"I think they\u0027re selling her along with the shotguns. A cute blond American girl. I think she\u0027s the ten-thousand-dollar bonus item.\"\n Nobody spoke.\n \"Did you notice what Harley said about her? Mint condition.\"\n Nobody spoke.\n \"I think they\u0027ve kept her fed and alive and untouched.\" I thought: Paulie wouldn\u0027t have bothered with Elizabeth Beck if Teresa had been available to him. With all due respect to Elizabeth.\n Nobody spoke.\n \"They\u0027re probably cleaning her up right now,\" I said.\n Nobody spoke.\n \"I think she\u0027s headed for Tripoli,\" I said. \"Part of the deal. Like a sweetener.\"\n Villanueva accelerated hard. The wind howled louder around the windshield pillars and the door mirrors. Two minutes later we reached the spot where we had ambushed the bodyguards and he slowed again. We were five miles from the house. Theoretically we were already visible from the upper floor windows. We came to a stop in the center of the road and we all craned forward and stared into the east.\n I used an olive-green Chevrolet and made it out to MacLean in twenty-nine minutes. Stopped in the center of the road two hundred yards shy of Quinn\u0027s residence. It was in an established subdivision. The whole place was quiet and green and watered and was baking lazily in the sun. The houses were on acre lots and were half-hidden behind thick evergreen foundation plantings. Their driveways were jet black. I could hear birds singing and a far-off sprinkler turning slowly and hissing against a soaked sidewalk through sixty degrees of its rotation. I could see fat dragonflies in the air.\n I took my foot off the brake and crawled forward a hundred yards. Quinn\u0027s house was sided with dark cedar boards. It had a stone walk and knee-high stone walls boxing in earth beds full of low spruces and rhododendrons. It had small windows and the way the eaves of the roof met the tops of the walls made it feel like the house was crouched down with its back to me.\n Frasconi\u0027s car was parked in the driveway. It was an olive-green Chevrolet identical to my own. It was empty. Its front bumper was tight against Quinn\u0027s garage door. The garage was a long low triple. It was closed up. There was no sound anywhere, except the birds and the sprinkler and the hum of insects.\n I parked behind Frasconi\u0027s car. My tires sounded wet on the hot blacktop. I slid out and eased my Beretta out of its holster. Clicked the safety to fire and started up the stone walk. The front door was locked. The house was silent. I peered in through a hallway window. Saw nothing, except the kind of solid neutral furniture that goes into an expensive rental.\n I walked around to the rear. There was a flagstone patio with a barbecue grill on it. A square teak table going gray in the weather and four chairs. An off-white canvas sun umbrella on a pole. A lawn, and plenty of low-maintenance evergreen bushes. A cedar fence stained the same dark color as the house siding closed off the neighbors\u0027 view.\n I tried the kitchen door. It was locked. I looked in the window. Saw nothing. I moved around the rear perimeter. Came to the next window and saw nothing. Moved to the next window and saw Frasconi lying on his back.\n He was in the middle of the living room floor. There was a sofa and two armchairs all covered in durable mud-colored fabric. The floor was done in wall-to-wall carpet and it matched the olive of his uniform. He had been shot once through the forehead. Nine millimeter. Fatal. Even through the window I could see the single crusted hole and the dull ivory color of his skull under his skin. There was a lake of blood under his head. It had soaked into the carpet and was already drying and turning dark.\n I didn\u0027t want to go in on the first floor. If Quinn was still in there he would be waiting upstairs where he had the tactical advantage. So I dragged the patio table over to the back of the garage and used it to climb onto the roof. Used the roof to get me next to an upstairs window. Used my elbow to get me through the glass. Then I went feetfirst into a guest bedroom. It smelled musty and unused. I walked through it and came out in an upstairs hallway. Stood still and listened. Heard nothing. The house sounded completely empty. There was a deadness. A total absence of sound. No human vibrations.\n But I could smell blood.\n I crossed the upstairs hallway and found Dominique Kohl in the master bedroom. She was on her back on the bed. She was completely naked. Her clothes had been torn off. She had been hit in the face enough times to make her groggy and then she had been butchered. Her breasts had been removed with a large knife. I could see the knife. It had been thrust upward through the soft flesh under her chin and through the roof of her mouth and into her brain.\n By that point in my life I had seen a lot of things. I had once woken up after a terrorist attack with part of another man\u0027s jawbone buried in my gut. I had had to wipe his flesh out of my eyes before I could see well enough to crawl away. I had crawled twenty yards through severed legs and arms and butted my knees against severed heads with my hands pressed hard into my abdomen to stop my own intestines falling out. I had seen homicides and accidents and men machine-gunned in feuds and people reduced to pink paste in explosions and blackened twisted lumps in fires. But I had never seen anything as bad as Dominique Kohl\u0027s butchered body. I threw up on the floor and then for the first time in more than twenty years I cried.\n \"So what now?\" Villanueva said, ten years later.\n \"I\u0027m going in alone,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m coming with you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t argue,\" I said. \"Just get me a little closer. And drive real slow.\"\n It was a gray car on a gray day and slow-moving objects are less perceptible than fast-moving objects. He took his foot off the brake and touched the gas and got it rolling at about ten miles an hour. I checked the Beretta and its spare magazines. Forty-five rounds, less two fired into Duke\u0027s ceiling. I checked the Persuaders. Fourteen rounds, less one fired through Harley\u0027s gut. Total of fifty-six rounds, against less than eighteen people. I didn\u0027t know who was on the guest list, but Emily Smith and Harley himself were going to be no-shows for sure.\n \"Stupid to do it alone,\" Villanueva said.\n \"Stupid to do it together,\" I said back. \"The approach is going to be suicidal.\"\n He didn\u0027t answer.\n \"Better that you guys stand by out here,\" I said.\n He made no reply to that. He wanted my back and he wanted Teresa but he was smart enough to see that walking toward a fortified and isolated house in the last of the daylight was going to be no kind of fun. He just kept the car rolling slowly. Then he took his foot off the gas and put the transmission in neutral and let it coast to a stop. He didn\u0027t want to risk the flare of brake lights in the mist. We were maybe a quarter-mile short of the house.\n \"You guys wait here,\" I said. \"For the duration.\"\n Villanueva looked away.\n \"Give me one hour,\" I said.\n I waited until they both nodded.\n \"Then call ATF,\" I said. \"After an hour, if I\u0027m not back.\"\n \"Maybe we should do that now,\" Duffy said.\n \"No,\" I said. \"I want the hour first.\"\n \"ATF will get Quinn,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not like they\u0027re going to let him walk.\"\n I thought back to what I had seen and just shook my head.\n I broke every regulation and ignored every procedure in the book. I walked away from a crime scene and failed to report it. I obstructed justice left and right. I left Kohl in the bedroom and Frasconi in the living room. Left their car on the driveway. Just drove myself back to the office and took a silenced Ruger Standard.22 from the company armory and went to find Kohl\u0027s boxed-up files. My gut told me Quinn would make one stop before he headed for the Bahamas. He would have an emergency stash somewhere. Maybe phony ID, maybe a wad of cash, maybe a packed bag, maybe all three. He wouldn\u0027t hide the stash on-post. Nor in his rented house. He was too professional for that. Too cautious. He would want it safe and far away. I was gambling it would be in the place he had inherited in northern California. From his parents, the railroad worker and the stay-at-home mom. So I needed that address.\n Kohl\u0027s handwriting was neat. The two cartons were filled with her notes. They were comprehensive. They were meticulous. They broke my heart. I found the California address in an eight-page bio she had prepared. It was a five-digit house number on a road that came under the Eureka post office. Probably a lonely place, far out of town. I went to my company clerk\u0027s desk and signed a stack of travel warrants for myself. Put my service Beretta and the silenced Ruger in a canvas bag and drove to the airport. They gave me papers to sign before they let me carry loaded firearms inside the cabin. I wasn\u0027t about to check them. I figured there was a good chance Quinn might take the same flight. I figured if I saw him at the gate or on the plane I would waste him right there and then.\n But I didn\u0027t see him. I got on a plane for Sacramento and walked the aisle after takeoff and scanned every face and he wasn\u0027t there. So I sat tight for the duration of the flight. Just stared into space. The stewardesses stayed well away from me.\n I rented a car at the Sacramento airport. Drove it north on I-5 and then northwest on Route 299. It was a designated scenic road. It wound through the mountains. I looked at nothing except the yellow line ahead of me. I had picked up three hours because of flying across three time zones but even so it was gathering dark when I hit the Eureka limit. I found Quinn\u0027s road. It was a meandering strip that ran north-south high in the hills above U.S. 101. The highway was laid out far below me. I could see headlights streaming north. Taillights heading south. I guessed there was a rail line down there somewhere. Maybe a station or a depot nearby, convenient for Quinn\u0027s old man back when he was working.\n I found the house. Drove past it without slowing. It was a rough one-story cabin. It used an old milk churn instead of a mailbox post. The front yard had gone to seed a decade ago. I K-turned five hundred yards south of it and drove two hundred yards back toward it with my lights off. Parked behind an abandoned diner with a caved-in roof. Got out and climbed a hundred feet into the hills. Walked north three hundred yards and came on his place from the rear.\n In the dusk I could see a narrow back porch and a scuffed area next to it where cars could be parked. Clearly it was the sort of place where you use the back door, not the front. There were no lights on inside. I could see dusty sun-faded drapes half-closed in the windows. The whole place looked empty and unused. I could see a couple of miles north and south and there were no cars on the road.\n I came down the hill slowly on foot. Circled the house. Listened at every window. There was nobody inside. I figured Quinn would park in back and come in through the rear, so I broke in through the front. The door was thin and old and I just pushed hard on it until the inner jamb started to give and then I smacked it once above the lock with the heel of my hand. Wood splintered and the door swung open and I stepped inside and closed it again and wedged it shut with a chair. It would look OK from the outside.\n It was musty inside and easily ten degrees colder than outside. It was dark and dim. I could hear a refrigerator running in the kitchen, so I knew there was electricity. The walls were covered in ancient wallpaper. It was faded and yellow. There were only four rooms. There was an eat-in kitchen, and a living room. There were two bedrooms. One was small and the other was smaller. I figured the smaller one had been Quinn\u0027s, as a kid. There was a lone bathroom between the bedrooms. White fixtures, stained with rust.\n Four rooms plus a bath is an easier search than most. I found what I was looking for almost immediately. I lifted a rag rug off of the living room floor and found a square hatch let into the boards. If it had been in the hallway I would have figured it for an inspection cover above the crawl space. But it was in the living room. I took a fork from the kitchen and levered it open. Under it was a shallow wooden tray built between the floor joists. On the tray was a shoe box wrapped in milky plastic sheeting. Inside the shoe box were three thousand dollars and two keys. I figured the keys were for safety-deposit boxes or left-luggage lockers. I took the cash and left the keys where they were. Then I put the hatch lid back and replaced the rug and chose a chair and sat down to wait with my Beretta in my pocket and the Ruger laid across my lap.\n \"Take care,\" Duffy said.\n I nodded. \"Sure.\"\n Villanueva said nothing. I slid out of the Taurus with the Beretta in my pocket and the Persuaders held one in each hand. Crossed straight to the shoulder of the road and got as far down on the rocks as I could and started picking my way east. There was still daylight behind the clouds but I was dressed in black and I was carrying black guns and I wasn\u0027t exactly on the road itself and I thought I might have a chance. The wind was blowing hard toward me and there was water in the air. I could see the ocean ahead. It was raging. The tide was on the way out. I could hear the distant waves pounding and the long suck of the undertow ripping through sand and gravel.\n I came around a shallow curve and saw that the wall lights were on. They blazed blue-white against the dim sky. The contrast between the electric light and the late-afternoon darkness beyond it would mean they would see me less and less well the closer I got. So I climbed back onto the roadway and started to jog. I got as close as I dared and then slipped back down the rocks and hugged the shore. The ocean was right at my feet. I could smell salt and seaweed. The rocks were slippery. Waves pounded and spray burst up at me and the water swirled angrily.\n I stood still. Took a breath. Realized I couldn\u0027t swim around the wall. Not this time. It would be madness. The sea was way too rough. I would have no chance. No chance at all. I would be tossed around like a cork and smashed against the rocks and battered to death. Unless the undertow got me first and pulled me out and swallowed me into the depths and drowned me.\n Can\u0027t go around it, can\u0027t go over it. Got to go through it.\n I climbed up the rocks again and stepped into the bar of light as far from the gate as I could get. I was all the way over where the foundations canted down toward the water. Then I kept very close to the wall and walked along its length. I was bathed in light. But nobody east of the wall could see me because it was between me and the house and it was taller than me. And anybody west of me was a friend. All I had to worry about was tripping the sensors buried in the ground. I stepped as lightly as I could and hoped they hadn\u0027t buried any this close in.\n And I guess they hadn\u0027t, because I made it to the gatehouse OK. I risked a glance inside through the gap in the drapes in the front window and saw the brightly-lit living room and Paulie\u0027s replacement busy relaxing on the collapsed sofa. He was a guy I hadn\u0027t seen before. He was about Duke\u0027s age and size. Maybe approaching forty, maybe a little slighter than me. I spent some time figuring his exact height. That was going to be important. He was possibly two inches shorter than me. He was dressed in jeans and a white T-shirt and a denim jacket. Clearly he wasn\u0027t going to the ball. He was Cinderella, tasked to watch the gate while the others partied. I hoped he was the only one. I hoped they were working a skeleton crew. But I wasn\u0027t about to bet on it. Any kind of minimal caution would put a second guy on the front door of the house, and maybe a third up there in Duke\u0027s window. Because they knew Paulie hadn\u0027t gotten the job done. They knew I was still out there somewhere.\n I couldn\u0027t afford the noise involved in shooting the new guy. The waves were loud and the wind was howling but neither sound would mask the Beretta. And nothing on earth would mask a Persuader firing a Brenneke Magnum. So I retreated a couple of yards and put the Persuaders down on the ground and took my coat and my jacket off. Then I took my shirt off and wrapped it tight around my left fist. Put my bare back against the wall and sidestepped my way to the edge of the window. Used the nails on my right hand to tap softly on the bottom corner of the glass, where it was draped, on and off, faint little paradiddles like a mouse makes when he runs across above a ceiling. I did it four times and was about to try a fifth when I saw in the corner of my eye the light in the window suddenly go dim. That meant the new guy had gotten off his sofa and pressed his face up against the glass to try to see what kind of little creature was out there bothering him. So I concentrated on getting the height exactly right and spun one-eighty and threw a huge roundhouse left with my padded fist and bust the window first and the new guy\u0027s nose a millisecond later. He went down in a heap below the inside sill and I reached in through the hole I had made and unlatched the casement and swung it open and climbed inside. The guy was sitting on his butt on the floor. He was bleeding from his nose and the glass cuts in his face. He was groggy. There was a handgun on the sofa. He was eight feet away from it. He was twelve feet from the phones. He shook his head to clear it and looked up at me.\n \"You\u0027re Reacher,\" he said. There was blood in his mouth.\n \"Correct,\" I said back.\n \"You\u0027ve got no chance,\" he said.\n \"You think?\"\n He nodded. \"We\u0027ve got shoot-to-kill orders.\"\n \"On me?\"\n He nodded again.\n \"Who has?\"\n \"Everybody.\"\n \"Xavier\u0027s orders?\"\n He nodded again. Put the back of his hand up under his nose.\n \"People going to obey those orders?\" I asked.\n \"For sure.\"\n \"Are you?\"\n \"I guess not.\"\n \"Promise?\"\n \"I guess so.\"\n \"OK,\" I said.\n I paused for a moment and thought about asking him some more questions. He might be reluctant. But I figured I could slap him around some and get all the answers he had to give. But in the end I figured those answers didn\u0027t matter very much. Made no practical difference to me if there were ten or twelve or fifteen hostiles in the house, or what they were armed with. Shoot to kill. Them or me. So I just stepped away and was trying to decide what to do with the guy when he made my mind up for me by reneging on his promise. He came up off the floor and made a dive for the handgun on the sofa. I caught him with a wild left in the throat. It was a solid punch, and a lucky one. But not for him. It crushed his larynx. He went down on the floor again and suffocated. It was reasonably quick. About a minute and a half. There was nothing I could do for him. I\u0027m not a doctor.\n I stood completely still for a minute. Then I put my shirt back on and climbed back out of the window and retrieved the shotguns and my jacket and my coat and climbed back in and crossed the room and looked out of the back window at the house.\n \"Shit,\" I said, and looked away.\n The Cadillac was parked on the carriage circle. Eliot hadn\u0027t gotten away. Nor had Elizabeth, or Richard, or the cook. That put three noncombatants into the mix. And the presence of noncombatants makes any assault a hundred times harder. And this one was hard enough to begin with.\n I looked again. Next to the Cadillac was a black Lincoln Town Car. Next to the Town Car were two dark blue Suburbans. There was no catering truck. Maybe it was around the side, next to the kitchen door. Maybe it was coming later. Or maybe it wasn\u0027t coming at all. Maybe there was no banquet. Maybe I had screwed up completely and misinterpreted the whole situation.\n I stared through the harsh lights on the wall into the gloom around the house. I couldn\u0027t see a guard on the front door. But then, it was cold and wet and anybody with any sense would be inside the hallway looking out through the glass. I couldn\u0027t see anybody in Duke\u0027s window, either. But it was standing open, exactly the way I had left it. Presumably the NSV was still hanging there on its chain.\n I looked at the vehicles again. The Town Car could have brought four people in. The Suburbans could have brought seven each. Eighteen people, maximum. Maybe fifteen or sixteen principals and two or three guards. Alternatively, maybe only three drivers came. Maybe I was completely wrong.\n Only one way to find out.\n And this was the hardest part. I had to get through the lights. I debated finding the switch and turning them off. But that would be an instant early warning to the people in the house. Five seconds after they went off they would be on the phone asking the gate guard what had happened. And the gate guard couldn\u0027t answer, because the gate guard was dead. Whereupon I would have fifteen or more people swarming straight at me in the gloom. Easy enough to avoid most of them. But the trick would be to know who to avoid, and who to grab. Because I was pretty sure if I let Quinn get behind me tonight I would never see him again.\n So I had to do it with the lights blazing. Two possibilities. One was to run straight toward the house. That would minimize the time I spent actually illuminated. But it would involve rapid motion, and rapid motion catches the eye. The other possibility would be to traverse the wall all the way to the ocean. Sixty yards, slowly. It would be agony. But it was probably the better option.\n Because the lights were mounted on the wall, trained away from it. There would be a dark tunnel between the wall itself and the rear edge of the beams. It would be a slim triangle. I could crawl along it, right down at the base of the structure. Slowly. Through the NSV\u0027s field of fire.\n I eased the rear door open. There were no lights on the gatehouse itself. They started twenty feet to my right, where the gatehouse wall became the perimeter wall. I stepped halfway out and crouched down. Turned ninety degrees right and looked for my tunnel. It was there. It was less than three feet deep at ground level. It narrowed to nothing at head height. And it wasn\u0027t very dark. There was scatter coming back off the ground and there were occasional misaligned beams and there was glow coming out of the rear of the lamps themselves. My tunnel was maybe halfway between pitch dark and brilliantly lit.\n I shuffled forward on my knees and reached back and closed the door behind me. Put a Persuader in each hand and dropped to my stomach and pressed my right shoulder hard against the base of the wall. Then I waited. Just long enough for anybody who thought they\u0027d seen the door move to lose interest. Then I started crawling. Slowly.\n I got maybe ten feet. Then I stopped again. Fast. I heard a vehicle out on the road. Not a sedan. Something bigger than that. Maybe another Suburban. I reversed direction. Dug my toes in and crawled backward to the doorway. Knelt up and opened the door and slid inside the gatehouse and stood up. Put the Persuaders on a chair and took the Beretta out of my pocket. I could hear a big-inch V-8 idling on the other side of the gate.\n Decisions. Whoever was out there was expecting the gate guard\u0027s services. And a buck got ten whoever was out there would know I wasn\u0027t the real gate guard. So I figured I would have to give up on the crawling. I figured I would have to go noisy. Shoot them, take their vehicle, make it down to the house real fast before the NSV gunner could draw a bead. Then take my chances in the ensuing chaos.\n I stepped to the back door again. Clicked the Beretta\u0027s safety off and took a breath. I had the initial advantage. I already knew exactly what I was going to do. Everybody else would have to react first. And that would take them a second too long.\n Then I remembered the camera on the gatepost. The video monitor. I could see exactly what I was faced with. I could count heads. Forewarned is forearmed. I stepped across to check. The picture was gray and milky. It showed a white panel van. Writing on the side. Keast amp; Maden Catering. I breathed out. No reason why they should know the gate man. I put the Beretta back in my pocket. Stripped off my coat and jacket. Pulled the denim thing off the gate man\u0027s body and slipped it on. It was tight, and there was blood on it. But it was reasonably convincing. I stepped out the door. Kept my back to the house and tried to make myself look two inches shorter. Walked to the gate. Butted the latch upward with my fist, the same way Paulie used to. Hauled it open. The white truck drove up level with me. The passenger buzzed his window down. He was wearing a tux. The guy at the wheel was in a tux. More noncombatants.\n \"Where to?\" the passenger asked.\n \"Around the house to the right,\" I said. \"Kitchen door\u0027s all the way at the back.\"\n The window went back up. The truck drove past me. I waved. Closed the gate again. Stepped back into the lodge and watched the truck from the window. It headed straight for the house and then swung right at the carriage circle. Its headlight beams washed over the Cadillac and the Town Car and the two Suburbans and I caught a flare from its brake lights and then it disappeared from view.\n I waited two minutes. Willed it to get darker. Then I changed back into my own coat and jacket and retrieved the Persuaders from the chair. Eased the door open and crawled out and closed it behind me and dropped to my stomach. Pressed my shoulder to the base of the wall and started the slow crawl all over again. I kept my face turned away from the house. There was grit underneath me and I could feel small stones sharp against my elbows and my knees. But mostly I could feel a tingle in my back. It was facing a weapon that could fire twelve half-inch bullets every second. There was probably some tough guy right behind it with his hands resting lightly on the handles. I was hoping he would miss with the first burst. I figured he probably would. I figured he would fire the first burst way low or way high. Whereupon I would be up and running zigzags into the darkness before he lined up for a better try.\n I inched forward. Ten yards. Fifteen. Twenty. I kept it really slow. Kept my face turned to the wall. Hoped I looked like a vague indistinct shadow in the penumbra. It was completely counterintuitive. I was fighting a powerful desire to jump up and run. My heart was pounding. I was sweating, even though it was cold. The wind was battering me. It was coming off the sea and hitting the wall and streaming down it like a tide and trying to roll me out to where the lights were brightest.\n I kept going. Made it about halfway. About thirty yards covered, about thirty yards to go. My elbows were sore. I was keeping the Persuaders up off the ground and my arms were taking the toll. I stopped to rest. Just pressed myself into the dirt. Tried to look like a rock. I turned my head and risked a glance toward the house. It was quiet. I glanced ahead. Glanced behind. The point of no return. I crawled on. Had to force myself to keep the speed slow. The farther I got, the worse my back tingled. I was breathing hard. Getting close to panic. Adrenaline was boiling through me, screaming run, run. I gasped and panted and forced my arms and legs to stay coordinated. To stay slow. Then I got within ten yards of the end and started to believe I could make it. I stopped. Took a breath. And another. Started again. Then the ground tilted down and I followed it headfirst. I reached the water. Felt wet slime underneath me. Small rough waves came at me and spray hit me. I turned a ninety-degree left and paused. I was way on the edge of anybody\u0027s field of view, but I had to get through thirty feet of bright light. I gave up on keeping it slow. I ducked my head and half-stood and just ran for it.\n I spent maybe four seconds lit up brighter than I had ever been before. It felt like four lifetimes. I was blinded. Then I crashed back into darkness and crouched down and listened. Heard nothing except the wild sea. Saw nothing except purple spots in my eyes. I stumbled on another ten paces over the rocks and then stood still. Looked back. I was in. I smiled in the dark. Quinn, I\u0027m coming to get you now. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/persuader-jack-reacher-7/page-14.html","bookId":2345,"book":{"id":2345,"title":"Persuader (Jack Reacher #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Persuader (Jack Reacher #7) \n Jack Reacher. \n The ultimate loner. \n An elite ex-military cop who left the service years ago, he\u0027s moved from place to place...without family...without possessions...without commitments. \n And without fear.
