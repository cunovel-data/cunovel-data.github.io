{"id":66130,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Time ticking away. That\u0027s what I was conscious of. This was some kind of a trial or a test, and it was going to take me at least ten precious hours to complete it. Ten hours that I didn\u0027t have to spare. And the truck was a pig to drive. It was old and balky and there was a constant roaring from the engine and a screaming whine from the transmission. The suspension was soft and worn out and the whole vehicle floated and wallowed. But the rearview mirrors were big solid rectangular things bolted to the doors and they gave me a pretty good view of anything more than ten yards behind me. I was on I-95, heading south, and it was quiet. I was pretty sure nobody was tailing me. Pretty sure, but not completely certain.\n I slowed as much as I dared and squirmed around and put my left foot on the gas pedal and ducked down and pulled off my right shoe. Juggled it up into my lap and extracted the e-mail device one-handed. I held it tight against the rim of the steering wheel and drove and typed all at the same time: urgent meet me 1st I-95 rest area southbound S of Kennebunk exit now immediately bring soldering iron and lead solder Radio Shack or hardware store. Then I hit send now and dropped the thing on the seat beside me. Kicked my foot back into the shoe and got it back on the pedal and straightened up in the seat. Checked the mirrors again. Nothing there. So I did some math. Kennebunk to New London was a distance of maybe two hundred miles, maybe a little more. Four hours at fifty miles an hour. Two hours fifty minutes at seventy, and seventy was probably the best I was going to get out of that particular truck. So I would have a maximum margin of an hour and ten minutes to do whatever I decided I needed to.\n I drove on. I kept it at a steady fifty in the right lane. Everybody passed me. Nobody stayed behind me. I had no tail. I wasn\u0027t sure if that was good or bad. The alternative might be worse. I passed the Kennebunk exit after twenty-nine minutes. Saw a rest area sign a mile later. It promised food and gas and restrooms seven miles ahead. The seven miles took me eight and a half minutes. Then there was a shallow ramp that swooped right and rose up a slope through a thicket of trees. The view wasn\u0027t good. The leaves were small and new but there were so many of them that I couldn\u0027t see much. The rest area itself was invisible to me. I let the truck coast and crested the rise and drove down into a perfectly standard interstate facility. It was just a wide road with diagonal parking slots on both sides and a small huddle of low brick buildings on the right. Beyond the buildings was a gas station. There were maybe a dozen cars parked close to the bathrooms. One of them was Susan Duffy\u0027s Taurus. It was last in line on the left. She was standing next to it with Eliot at her side.\n I drove slowly past her and made a wait gesture with my hand and parked four slots beyond her. I switched off the engine and sat gratefully in the sudden silence for a moment. I put the e-mail device back in my heel and laced my shoe. Then I tried to look like a normal person. I stretched my arms and opened the door and slid out and stumped around for a moment like a guy easing his cramped legs and relishing the fresh forest air. I turned a couple of complete circles and scanned the whole area and then stood still and kept my eyes on the ramp. Nobody came up it. I could hear light traffic out on the highway. It was close by and fairly loud, but the way it was all behind the trees made me feel private and isolated. I counted off seventy-two seconds, which represents a mile at fifty miles an hour. Nobody came up the ramp. And nobody follows at a distance of more than a mile. So I ran straight over to where Duffy and Eliot were waiting for me. He was in casual clothes and looked a little uneasy in them. She was in worn jeans and the same battered leather jacket I had seen before. She looked spectacular in them. Neither of them wasted any time on greetings, which I guess I was happy about.\n \"Where are you headed?\" Eliot asked.\n \" New London, Connecticut,\" I said.\n \"What\u0027s in the truck?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"No tail,\" Duffy said, like a statement, not a question.\n \"Might be electronic,\" I said.\n \"Where would it be?\"\n \"In the back, if they\u0027ve got any sense. Did you get the soldering iron?\"\n \"Not yet,\" she said. \"It\u0027s on its way. Why do we need it?\"\n \"There\u0027s a lead seal,\" I said. \"We need to be able to remake it.\"\n She glanced at the ramp, anxious. \"Hard thing to get ahold of at short notice.\"\n \"Let\u0027s check the parts we can get to,\" Eliot said. \"While we\u0027re waiting.\"\n We jogged back to the blue truck. I got down on the ground and took a look at the underside. It was all caked in ancient gray mud and streaked with leaking oil and fluid.\n \"It won\u0027t be here,\" I said. \"They\u0027d need a chisel to get close to the metal.\"\n Eliot found it inside the cab about fifteen seconds after he started looking. It was stuck to the foam on the bottom of the passenger\u0027s seat with a little dot of hook-and-loop fastener. It was a tiny bare metal can a little bigger than a quarter and about half an inch thick. It trailed a thin eight-inch wire that was presumably the transmitting antenna. Eliot closed the whole thing into his fist and backed out of the cab fast and stared at the mouth of the ramp.\n \"What?\" Duffy asked.\n \"This is weird,\" he said. \"Thing like this has a hearing-aid battery, nothing more. Low power, short range. Can\u0027t be picked up beyond about two miles. So where\u0027s the guy tracking it?\"\n The mouth of the ramp was empty. I had been the last guy up it. We stood there with our eyes watering in the cold wind, staring at nothing. Traffic hissed by behind the trees, but nothing came up the ramp.\n \"How long have you been here now?\" Eliot asked.\n \"About four minutes,\" I said. \"Maybe five.\"\n \"Makes no sense,\" he said. \"That puts the guy maybe four or five miles behind you. And he can\u0027t hear this thing from four or five miles.\"\n \"Maybe there\u0027s no guy,\" I said. \"Maybe they trust me.\"\n \"So why put this thing in there?\"\n \"Maybe they didn\u0027t. Maybe it\u0027s been in there for years. Maybe they forgot all about it.\"\n \"Too many maybes,\" he said.\n Duffy spun right and stared at the trees.\n \"They could have stopped on the highway shoulder,\" she said. \"You know, exactly level with where we are now.\"\n Eliot and I spun to our right and stared, too. It made good sense. It was no kind of clever surveillance technique to pull into a rest stop and park right next to your target.\n \"Let\u0027s take a look,\" I said.\n There was a narrow strip of neat grass and then an equally narrow area where the highway people had tamed the edge of the woods with planted shrubs and bark chips. Then there were just trees. The highway had mown them down to the east and the rest area had leveled them to the west but in between was a forty-foot thicket that could have been growing there since the dawn of time. It was hard work getting through it. There were vines and scratchy brambles and low branches. But it was April. Getting through in July or August might have been impossible.\n We stopped just before the trees petered out into lower growth. Beyond that was the flat grassy highway shoulder. We eased forward as far as we dared and craned left and right. There was nobody parked there. The shoulder was clear as far as we could see in both directions. Traffic was very light. Whole five-second intervals went by with no vehicles in view at all. Eliot shrugged like he didn\u0027t understand it and we turned around and forced our way back.\n \"Makes no sense,\" he said again.\n \"They\u0027re short of manpower,\" I said.\n \"No, they\u0027re on Route One,\" Duffy said. \"They must be. It runs parallel with I-95 the whole way down the coast. From Portland, way down south. It\u0027s probably less than two miles away most of the time.\"\n We turned east again, like we could see through the trees and spot a car idling on the shoulder of a distant parallel road.\n \"It\u0027s how I\u0027d do it,\" Duffy said.\n I nodded. It was a very plausible scenario. There would be technical disadvantages. With up to two miles of lateral displacement any slight fore-aft discrepancy due to traffic would make the signal drift in and out of range. But then, all they wanted to know was my general direction.\n \"It\u0027s possible,\" I said.\n \"No, it\u0027s likely,\" Eliot said. \"Duffy\u0027s right. It\u0027s pure common sense. They want to stay out of your mirrors as long as they can.\"\n \"Either way, we have to assume they\u0027re there. How far does Route One stay close to I-95?\"\n \"Forever,\" Duffy said. \"Way farther than New London, Connecticut. They split around Boston, but they come back together.\"\n \"OK,\" I said. Checked my watch. \"I\u0027ve been here about nine minutes now. Long enough for the bathroom and a cup of coffee. Time to put the electronics back on the road.\"\n I told Eliot to put the transmitter in his pocket and drive Duffy\u0027s Taurus south at a steady fifty miles an hour. I told him I would catch him in the truck somewhere before New London. I figured I would worry about how to get the transmitter back in the right place later. Eliot took off and I was left alone with Duffy. We watched her car disappear south and then swiveled around north and watched the incoming ramp. I had an hour and one minute and I needed the soldering iron. Time ticking away.\n \"How is it up there?\" Duffy asked.\n \"A nightmare,\" I said. I told her about the eight-foot granite wall and the razor wire and the gate and the metal detectors on the doors and the room with no inside keyhole. I told her about Paulie.\n \"Any sign of my agent?\" she asked.\n \"I only just got there,\" I said.\n \"She\u0027s in that house,\" she said. \"I have to believe that.\"\n I said nothing.\n \"You need to make some progress,\" she said. \"Every hour you spend there puts you deeper in trouble. And her.\"\n \"I know that,\" I said.\n \"What\u0027s Beck like?\" she asked.\n \"Bent,\" I said. I told her about the fingerprints on the glass and the way the Maxima had disappeared. Then I told her about the Russian roulette.\n \"You played?\"\n \"Six times,\" I said, and stared at the ramp.\n She stared at me. \"You\u0027re crazy. Six to one, you should be dead.\"\n I smiled. \"You ever played?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t. I don\u0027t like those odds.\"\n \"You\u0027re like most people. Beck was the same. He thought the odds were six to one. But they\u0027re nearer six hundred to one. Or six thousand. You put a single heavy bullet in a well-made well-maintained gun like that Anaconda and it would be a miracle if the cylinder came to rest with the bullet near the top. The momentum of the spin always carries it to the bottom. Precision mechanism, a little oil, gravity helps you out. I\u0027m not an idiot. Russian roulette is a lot safer than people think. And it was worth the risk to get hired.\"\n She was quiet for a spell.\n \"You got a feeling?\" she asked.\n \"He looks like a rug importer,\" I said. \"There are rugs all over the damn place.\"\n \"But?\"\n \"But he isn\u0027t,\" I said. \"I\u0027d bet my pension on it. I asked him about the rugs and he didn\u0027t say much. Like he wasn\u0027t very interested in them. Most people like to talk about their businesses. Most people, you can\u0027t shut them up.\"\n \"You get a pension?\"\n \"No,\" I said.\n Right then a gray Taurus identical to Duffy\u0027s except for the color burst up over the rise of the ramp. It slowed momentarily while the driver scanned around and then accelerated hard straight toward us. It was the old guy at the wheel, the one I had left in the gutter near the college gate. He slammed to a stop next to my blue truck and opened his door and heaved himself up and out in exactly the same way he had gotten out of the borrowed police Caprice. He had a big black-and-red Radio Shack bag in his hand. It was bulky with boxes. He held it up and smiled and stepped forward to shake my hand. He had a fresh shirt on, but his suit was the same. I could see blotches where he had tried to sponge the fake blood out. I could picture him, standing at his motel room sink, getting busy with the hand towel. He hadn\u0027t been very successful. It looked like he had been careless with the ketchup at dinner.\n \"They got you running errands already?\" he asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know what they got me doing,\" I said. \"We got a lead seal problem.\"\n He nodded. \"I figured. Shopping list like that, what else could it be?\"\n \"You done one before?\"\n \"I\u0027m old-school,\" he said. \"We did ten a day, once upon a time, way back. Truck stops all over the place, we\u0027d be in and out before the guy had even ordered his soup.\"\n He squatted down and emptied the Radio Shack bag on the blacktop. He had a soldering iron and a spool of dull solder. And an inverter that would power the iron from his car\u0027s cigar lighter. That meant he had to keep his engine running, so he started it up and reversed a little way so that the cord would reach.\n The seal was basically a drawn lead wire with large tags molded on each end. The tags had been crushed together with some kind of a heated device so they had fused together in a large embossed blob. The old guy left the fused ends strictly alone. It was clear he had done this before. He plugged the iron in and let it heat. He tested it by spitting on the end. When he was satisfied he dabbed the tip on the sleeve of his suit coat and then touched it to the wire where it was thin. The wire melted and parted. He eased the gap wider like opening a tiny handcuff and slipped the seal out of its channel. He ducked into his car and laid it on the dash. I grabbed the door lever and turned it.\n \"OK,\" Duffy said. \"So what have we got?\"\n We had rugs. The door rattled upward and daylight flooded the load area and we saw maybe two hundred rugs, all neatly rolled and tied with string and standing upright on their ends. They were all different sizes, with the taller rolls at the cab end and the shorter ones at the door end. They stepped down toward us like some kind of ancient basalt rock formation. They were rolled face-in, so all we saw were the back surfaces, coarse and dull. The string around them was rough sisal, old and yellowed. There was a strong smell of raw wool and a fainter smell of vegetable dye.\n \"We should check them,\" Duffy said. There was disappointment in her voice.\n \"How long have we got?\" the old guy asked.\n I checked my watch.\n \"Forty minutes,\" I said.\n \"Better just sample them,\" he said.\n We hauled a couple out from the front rank. They were rolled tight. No cardboard tubes. They were just rolled in on themselves and tied tight with the string. One of them had a fringe. It smelled old and musty. The knots in the string were old and flattened. We picked at them with our nails but we couldn\u0027t get them undone.\n \"They must cut the string,\" Duffy said. \"We can\u0027t do that.\"\n \"No,\" the old guy said. \"We can\u0027t.\"\n The string was coarse and looked foreign. I hadn\u0027t seen string like that for a long time. It was made from some kind of a natural fiber. Jute, maybe, or hemp.\n \"So what do we do?\" the old guy asked.\n I pulled another rug out. Hefted it in my hands. It weighed about what a rug should weigh. I squeezed it. It gave slightly. I rested it end-down on the road and punched it in the middle. It yielded a little, exactly how a tightly-rolled rug would feel.\n \"They\u0027re just rugs,\" I said.\n \"Anything under them?\" Duffy asked. \"Maybe those tall ones in back aren\u0027t tall at all. Maybe they\u0027re resting on something else.\"\n We pulled rugs out one by one and laid them on the road in the order we would have to put them back in. We built ourselves a random zigzag channel through the load space. The tall ones were exactly what they appeared to be, tall rugs, rolled tight, tied with string, standing upright on their ends. There was nothing hidden. We climbed out of the truck and stood there in the cold surrounded by a crazy mess of rugs and looked at each other.\n \"It\u0027s a dummy load,\" Duffy said. \"Beck figured you would find a way in.\"\n \"Maybe,\" I said.\n \"Or else he just wanted you out of the way.\"\n \"While he\u0027s doing what?\"\n \"Checking you out,\" she said. \"Making sure.\"\n I looked at my watch. \"Time to reload. I\u0027m already going to have to drive like a madman.\"\n \"I\u0027ll come with you,\" she said. \"Until we catch up with Eliot, I mean.\"\n I nodded. \"I want you to. We need to talk.\"\n We put the rugs back inside, kicking and shoving them until they were neatly arranged in their original positions. Then I pulled the roller door down and the old guy got to work with the solder. He slipped the broken seal back through its channel and eased the parted ends close together. He heated the iron and bridged the gap with its tip and touched the free end of the solder roll to it. The gap filled with a large silvery blob. It was the wrong color and it was way too big. It made the wire look like a cartoon drawing of a snake that has just swallowed a rabbit.\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he said.\n He used the tip of the iron like a tiny paintbrush and smoothed the blob thinner and thinner. He flicked the tip occasionally to get rid of the excess. He was very delicate. It took him three long minutes but at the end of them he had the whole thing looking pretty much like it had before he arrived. He let it cool a little and then blew hard on it. The new silvery color instantly turned to gray. It was as close to an invisible repair as I had ever seen. Certainly it was better than I could have done myself.\n \"OK,\" I said. \"Very good. But you\u0027re going to have to do another one. I\u0027m supposed to bring another truck back. We better take a look at that one, too. We\u0027ll meet up in the first northbound rest area after Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\"\n \"When?\"\n \"Be there five hours from now.\"\n Duffy and I left him standing there and headed south as fast as I could get the old truck to move. It wouldn\u0027t do much better than seventy. It was shaped like a brick and the wind resistance defeated any attempt to go faster. But seventy was OK. I had a few minutes in hand.\n \"Did you see his office?\" she asked.\n \"Not yet,\" I said. \"We need to check it out. In fact we need to check out his whole harbor operation.\"\n \"We\u0027re working on it,\" she said. She had to talk loud. The engine noise and gearbox whine were twice as bad at seventy as they had been at fifty. \"Fortunately Portland is not too much of a madhouse. It\u0027s only the forty-fourth busiest port in the U.S. About fourteen million tons of imports a year. That\u0027s about a quarter-million tons a week. Beck seems to get about ten of them, two or three containers.\"\n \"Does Customs search his stuff?\"\n \"As much as they search anybody\u0027s. Their current hit rate is about two percent. If he gets a hundred and fifty containers a year maybe three of them will be looked at.\"\n \"So how is he doing it?\"\n \"He could be playing the odds by limiting the bad stuff to, say, one container in ten. That would bring the effective search rate down to zero-point-two percent. He could last years like that.\"\n \"He\u0027s already lasted years. He must be paying somebody off.\"\n She nodded beside me. Said nothing.\n \"Can you arrange extra scrutiny?\" I asked.\n \"Not without probable cause,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t forget, we\u0027re way off the books here. We need some hard evidence. And the possibility of a payoff makes the whole thing a minefield, anyway. We might approach the wrong official.\"\n We drove on. The engine roared and the suspension swayed. We were passing everything we saw. Now I was watching the mirrors for cops, not tails. I was guessing that Duffy\u0027s DEA papers would take care of any specific legal problems, but I didn\u0027t want to lose the time it would take for her to have the conversation.\n \"How did Beck react?\" she asked. \"First impression?\"\n \"He was puzzled,\" I said. \"And a little resentful. That was my first impression. You notice that Richard Beck wasn\u0027t guarded at school?\"\n \"Safe environment.\"\n \"Not really. You could take a kid out of a college, easy as anything. No guards means no danger. I think the bodyguard thing for the trip home was just some kind of a sop to the fact that the kid is paranoid. I think it was purely an indulgence. I don\u0027t think old man Beck can have thought it was really necessary, or he would have provided security at school as well. Or kept him out of school altogether.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So I think there was some kind of a done deal somewhere in the past. As a result of the original kidnap, maybe. Something that guaranteed some kind of stability. Hence no bodyguards in the dorm. Hence Beck\u0027s resentment, like somebody had suddenly broken an agreement.\"\n \"You think?\"\n I nodded at the wheel. \"He was surprised, and puzzled, and annoyed. His big question was who?\"\n \"Obvious question.\"\n \"But this was a how-dare-they kind of a question. There was attitude in it. Like somebody was out of line. It wasn\u0027t just an inquiry. It was an expression of annoyance at somebody.\"\n \"What did you tell him?\"\n \"I described the truck. I described your guys.\"\n She smiled. \"Safe enough.\"\n I shook my head. \"He\u0027s got a guy called Duke. First name unknown. Ex-cop. His head of security. I saw him this morning. He\u0027d been up all night. He looked tired and he hadn\u0027t showered. His suit coat was all creased, low down at the back.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Means he was driving all night. I think he went down there to get a look at the Toyota. To check the rear license plate. Where did you stash it?\"\n \"We let the state cops take it. To keep the plausibility going. We couldn\u0027t take it back to the DEA garage. It\u0027ll be in a compound somewhere.\"\n \"Where will the plate lead?\"\n \" Hartford, Connecticut,\" she said. \"We busted a small-time Ecstasy ring.\"\n \"When?\"\n \"Last week.\"\n I drove on. The highway was getting busier.\n \"Our first mistake,\" I said. \"Beck\u0027s going to check it out. And then he\u0027s going to be wondering why some small-time Ecstasy dealers from Connecticut are trying to snatch his son. And then he\u0027s going to be wondering how some small-time Ecstasy dealers from Connecticut can be trying to snatch his son a week after they all got hauled off to jail.\"\n \"Shit,\" Duffy said.\n \"It gets worse,\" I said. \"I think Duke got a look at the Lincoln, too. It\u0027s got a caved-in front and no window glass left, but it hasn\u0027t got any bullet holes in it. And it doesn\u0027t look like a real grenade went off inside. That Lincoln is living proof this whole thing was phony baloney.\"\n \"No,\" she said. \"The Lincoln is hidden. It didn\u0027t go with the Toyota.\"\n \"Are you sure? Because the first thing Beck asked me this morning was Chapter and verse about the Uzis. It was like he was asking me to damn myself right out of my own mouth. Two Uzi Micros, twenty-round mags, forty shots fired, and not a single mark on the car?\"\n \"No,\" she said again. \"No way. The Lincoln is hidden.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"It\u0027s in Boston. It\u0027s in our garage, but as far as any paperwork goes it\u0027s in the county morgue building. It\u0027s supposed to be a crime scene. The bodyguards are supposed to be plastered all over the inside. We aimed for plausibility. We thought this thing through.\"\n \"Except for the Toyota \u0027s plate.\"\n She looked deflated. \"But the Lincoln is OK. It\u0027s a hundred miles away from the Toyota. This guy Duke would have to drive all night.\"\n \"I think he did drive all night. And why was Beck so uptight about the Uzis?\"\n She went still.\n \"We have to abort,\" she said. \"Because of the Toyota. Not because of the Lincoln. The Lincoln \u0027s OK.\"\n I checked my watch. Checked the road ahead. The van roared on. We would be coming up on Eliot sometime soon. I calculated time and distance.\n \"We have to abort,\" she said again.\n \"What about your agent?\"\n \"Getting you killed won\u0027t help her.\"\n I thought about Quinn.\n \"We\u0027ll discuss it later,\" I said. \"Right now we stay in business.\"\n We passed Eliot after eight more minutes. His Taurus was sitting rock-steady in the inside lane, holding a modest fifty. I pulled ahead of him and matched his speed and he fell in behind. We skirted all the way around Boston and pulled into the first rest area we saw south of the city. The world was a lot busier down there. I sat still with Duffy at my side and watched the ramp for seventy-two seconds and saw four cars follow me in. None of their drivers paid me any attention. A couple of them had passengers. They all did normal rest-stop things like standing and yawning by their open doors and looking around and then heading over to the bathrooms and the fast food.\n \"Where\u0027s the next truck?\" Duffy asked.\n \"In a lot in New London,\" I said.\n \"Keys?\"\n \"In it.\"\n \"So there will be people there, too. Nobody leaves a truck alone with the keys in it. They\u0027ll be waiting for you. We don\u0027t know what they\u0027ve been told to do. We should consider termination.\"\n \"I won\u0027t walk into a trap,\" I said. \"Not my style. And the next truck might have something better in it.\"\n \"OK,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll check it in New Hampshire. If you get that far.\"\n \"You could lend me your Glock.\"\n I saw her reach up and touch it under her arm. \"How long for?\"\n \"As long as I need it.\"\n \"What happened to the Colts?\"\n \"They took them.\"\n \"I can\u0027t,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t give up my service weapon.\"\n \"You\u0027re already way off the books.\"\n She paused.\n \"Shit,\" she said. She took the Glock out of her holster and passed it to me. It was warm from the heat of her body. I held it in my palm and savored the feeling. She dug in her purse and came out with two spare magazines. I put them in one pocket and the gun in the other.\n \"Thanks,\" I said.\n \"See you in New Hampshire,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll check the truck. And then we\u0027ll decide.\"\n \"OK,\" I said, although I had already decided. Eliot walked over and took the transmitter out of his pocket. Duffy got out of his way and he stuck it back under her seat. Then they went off together, back to the government Taurus. I waited a plausible amount of time and got back on the road.\n I found New London without any problem. It was a messy old place. I had never been there before. Never had a reason to go. It\u0027s a Navy town. I think they build submarines there. Or somewhere nearby. Groton, maybe. The directions Beck had given me brought me off the highway early and threaded me through failing industrial areas. There was plenty of old brick, damp and smoke-stained and rotten. I pulled into the side of the road about a mile short of where I guessed the lot would be. Then I made a right and a left and tried to circle around it. I parked at a busted meter and checked Duffy\u0027s gun. It was a Glock 19. It was maybe a year old. It was fully loaded. The spare magazines were full, too. I got out of the truck. I heard booming foghorns way out in the Sound. A ferry was heading in. The wind was scraping trash along the street. A hooker stepped out of a doorway and smiled at me. It\u0027s a Navy town. She couldn\u0027t smell an army MP the way her sisters could elsewhere.\n I turned a corner and got a pretty good partial view of the lot I was headed for. The land sloped down toward the sea and I had some elevation. I could see the truck waiting for me. It was the twin of the one I was in. Same age, same type. Same color. It was sitting there all alone. It was in the exact center of the lot, which was just an empty square made of crushed brick and weeds. Some old building had been bulldozed two decades ago and nothing had been built to replace it.\n I couldn\u0027t see anybody waiting for me, although there were a thousand dirty windows within range and theoretically all of them could have been full of watchers. But I didn\u0027t feel anything. Feeling is a lot worse than knowing, but sometimes it\u0027s all you\u0027ve got. I stood still until I got cold and then I walked back to the truck. Drove it around the block and into the lot. Parked it nose to nose with its twin. Pulled the key and dropped it in the door pocket. Glanced around one last time and got out. I put my hand in my pocket and closed it around Duffy\u0027s gun. Listened hard. Nothing but grit blowing and the far-off sounds of a run-down city struggling through the day. I was OK, unless somebody was planning to drop me with a long-range rifle shot. And clutching a Glock 19 in my pocket wasn\u0027t going to defend against that.\n The new truck was cold and still. The door was unlocked and the key was right there in the pocket. I racked the seat and fixed the mirrors. Dropped the key on the floor like I was clumsy and checked under the seats. No transmitter. Just a few gum wrappers and dust bunnies. I started the engine. Backed away from the truck I had just gotten out of and swooped the new one around the lot and aimed it back toward the highway. I didn\u0027t see anybody. Nobody came after me.\n The new truck drove a little better than the old one had. It was a little quieter and a little faster. Maybe it had been around the clock only twice. It reeled in the miles, taking me back north. I stared ahead through the windshield and felt like I could see the lonely house on the rock finger getting bigger and bigger with every minute. It was drawing me in and repelling me simultaneously with equal force. So I just sat there immobile with one hand on the wheel and my eyelids locked open. Rhode Island was quiet. Nobody followed me through it. Massachusetts was mostly a long loop around Boston and then a sprint through the northeastern bump with the dumps like Lowell on my left and the cute places like Newburyport and Cape Ann and Gloucester far away on my right. No tail. Then came New Hampshire. I-95 sees about twenty miles of it with Portsmouth as the last stop. I passed it by and watched for rest area signs. I found one just inside the Maine state line. It told me that Duffy and Eliot and the old guy with the stained suit would be waiting for me eight miles ahead.\n It wasn\u0027t just Duffy and Eliot and the old guy. They had a DEA canine unit with them. I guess if you give government types enough time to think they\u0027ll come up with something you don\u0027t expect. I pulled into an area pretty much identical to the Kennebunk one and saw their two Tauruses parked on the end of the row next to a plain van with a spinning ventilator on the roof. I parked four slots away from them and went through the cautious routine of waiting and watching, but nobody pulled in after me. I didn\u0027t worry about the highway shoulder. The trees made me invisible from the highway. There were trees everywhere. Maine has got a whole lot of trees, that was for damn sure.\n I got out of the truck and the old guy pulled his car close and went straight into his thing with the soldering iron. Duffy pulled me out of his way by the elbow.\n \"I made some calls,\" she said. She held up her Nokia like she was proving it to me. \"Good news and bad news.\"\n \"Good news first,\" I said. \"Cheer me up.\"\n \"I think the Toyota thing might be OK.\"\n \"Might be?\"\n \"It\u0027s complicated. We got Beck\u0027s shipping schedule from U.S. Customs. All his stuff comes out of Odessa. It\u0027s in the Ukraine, on the Black Sea.\"\n \"I know where it is.\"\n \"Plausible point of origin for rugs. They come north through Turkey from all over. But Odessa is a heroin port, from our point of view. Everything that doesn\u0027t come here direct from Colombia feeds through Afghanistan and Turkmenistan and across the Caspian and the Caucasus. So if Beck\u0027s using Odessa it means he\u0027s a heroin guy, and if he\u0027s a heroin guy it means he doesn\u0027t know any Ecstasy dealers from Adam. Not in Connecticut, not anywhere. There can\u0027t be a relationship. No way. How could there be? It\u0027s a completely different part of the business. So he\u0027s starting from scratch as far as finding anything out goes. I mean, the Toyota plate will give him a name and an address, sure, but that information won\u0027t mean anything to him. It\u0027s going to be a few days before he can find out who they are and pick up their trail.\"\n \"That\u0027s the good news?\"\n \"It\u0027s good enough. Trust me, they\u0027re in separate worlds. And a few days is all you\u0027ve got anyway. We can\u0027t hold those bodyguards forever.\"\n \"What\u0027s the bad news?\"\n She paused a beat. \"It\u0027s actually not impossible that someone could have gotten a peek at the Lincoln.\"\n \"What happened?\"\n \"Nothing specific. Just that security at the garage maybe wasn\u0027t as good as it might have been.\"\n \"What does that mean?\"\n \"It means we can\u0027t say for sure that something bad didn\u0027t happen.\"\n We heard the truck\u0027s roller door rattle upward. It banged against its stop and a second later we heard Eliot calling us urgently. We stepped over there expecting to find something good. We found another transmitter instead. It was the same tiny metal can with the same eight-inch filament antenna. It was glued to the inside of the sheetmetal, near the loading door, about head height.\n \"Great,\" Duffy said.\n The load space was packed with rugs, exactly the same as we had seen before. It could have been the same van. They were rolled tight and tied with rough string and stacked on their ends in descending order of height.\n \"Do we check them?\" the old guy asked.\n \"No time,\" I said. \"If somebody\u0027s on the other end of that transmitter they\u0027ll figure I\u0027m entitled to maybe ten minutes here, nothing more.\"\n \"Put the dog in,\" Duffy said.\n A guy I hadn\u0027t met opened up the rear of the DEA van and came out with a beagle on a leash. It was a little fat low-slung thing wearing a working-dog harness. It had long ears and an eager expression. I like dogs. Sometimes I think about getting one. It could keep me company. This one ignored me completely. It just let its handler lead it over to the blue truck and then it waited to be told what to do. The guy lifted it up into the load space and put it down on the staircase of rugs. He clicked his fingers and spoke some kind of a command and took the leash off. The dog scampered up and down and side to side. Its legs were short and it had a problem making it up and down between the different levels. But it covered every inch and then came back to where it had started and stood there with its eyes bright and its tail wagging and its mouth open in an absurd wet smile like it was saying so where\u0027s the action?\n \"Nothing,\" its handler said.\n \"Legit load,\" Eliot said.\n Duffy nodded. \"But why is it coming back north? Nobody exports rugs back to Odessa. Why would they?\"\n \"It was a test,\" I said. \"For me. They figured maybe I\u0027d look, maybe I wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Fix the seal,\" Duffy said.\n The new guy hauled his beagle out and Eliot stretched up tall and pulled the door down. The old guy picked up his soldering iron and Duffy pulled me away again.\n \"Decision?\" she said.\n \"What would you do?\"\n \"Abort,\" she said. \"The Lincoln is the wild card. It could kill you.\"\n I looked over her shoulder and watched the old guy at work. He was already thinning the solder join.\n \"They bought the story,\" I said. \"Impossible not to. It was a great story.\"\n \"They might have looked at the Lincoln.\"\n \"I can\u0027t see why they would have wanted to.\"\n The old guy was finishing up. He was bending down, ready to blow on the join, ready to turn the wire dull gray. Duffy put her hand on my arm.\n \"Why was Beck talking about the Uzis?\" she asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"All done,\" the old guy called.\n \"Decision?\" Duffy said.\n I thought about Quinn. Thought about the way his gaze had traveled across my face, not fast, not slow. Thought about the.22 scars, like two extra eyes up there on the left of his forehead.\n \"I\u0027m going back,\" I said. \"I think it\u0027s safe enough. They\u0027d have gone for me this morning if they had any doubts.\"\n Duffy said nothing. She didn\u0027t argue. She just took her hand off my arm and let me go. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/persuader-jack-reacher-7/page-4.html","bookId":2345,"book":{"id":2345,"title":"Persuader (Jack Reacher #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Persuader (Jack Reacher #7) \n Jack Reacher. \n The ultimate loner. \n An elite ex-military cop who left the service years ago, he\u0027s moved from place to place...without family...without possessions...without commitments. \n And without fear.
