{"id":110948,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"I WISHED LISSA HAD \"needed\u0027 me to go take out an army of Strigoi. I would have felt more comfortable with that than what she needed to do now: meet with Jill to discuss the coronation. Lissa wanted me there for support, as a kind of go-between. I wasn\u0027t able to walk that well yet, so we waited another day. Lissa seemed glad for the delay. Jill was waiting for us in a small room I\u0027d never expected to see again: the parlor where Tatiana had berated me for moving in on Adrian. It had been a pretty bizarre experience at the time, seeing as Adrian and I hadn\u0027t actually been involved back then. Now, after everything that had occurred between him and me, it just felt ... strange. Confusing. I still didn\u0027t know what had happened to him since Tasha\u0027s arrest. Walking in there, I also felt terribly ... alone. No, not alone. Uninformed. Vulnerable. Jill sat in a chair, her hands folded in her lap. She stared straight ahead with an unreadable face. Beside me, Lissa\u0027s own features were equally blank. She felt ... well, that was the thing. I didn\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t know. I mean, I could tell she was uncomfortable, but there were no thoughts in my head to tip me off. I had no specifics. Again, I reminded myself that the rest of the world worked like this. You functioned alone. You did your best to manage strange situations without the magical insight of another person. I\u0027d never realized how much I\u0027d taken the thoughts of even just one other person for granted. The one thing I felt sure of was that both Lissa and Jill were freaked out by each other--but not by me. That was why I was here. \"Hey, Jill,\u0027 I said, smiling. \"How are you?\u0027 She snapped out of whatever thoughts had been occupying her and jumped up from the chair. I thought that was strange, but then it made sense. Lissa. You rose when a queen entered the room. \"It\u0027s okay,\u0027 said Lissa, stumbling over her words a little. \"Sit.\u0027 She took a seat opposite Jill. It was the biggest chair in the room--the one Tatiana had always sat in. Jill hesitated a moment, then shifted her gaze back to me. I must have provided some encouragement because she returned to her chair. I sat in one beside Lissa, wincing as a small pain tightened in my chest. Worry for me momentarily distracted Jill from Lissa. \"How are you feeling? Are you okay? Should you even be out of bed?\u0027 The cute, rambling nature. I was glad to see it again. \"Fine,\u0027 I lied. \"Good as new.\u0027 \"I was worried. When I saw what happened ... I mean, there was so much blood and so much craziness and no one knew if you\u0027d pull through ...\u0027 Jill frowned. \"I don\u0027t know. It was all so scary. I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re okay.\u0027 I kept smiling, hoping to reassure her. Silence fell then. The room grew tense. In political situations, Lissa was the expert, always able to smooth everything over with the right words. I was the one who spoke up in uncomfortable scenarios, saying the things that shocked others. The things no one wanted to hear. This situation seemed like one that required her diplomacy, but I knew it was on me to take charge. \"Jill,\u0027 I said, \"we wanted to know if you\u0027d be willing to, well, take part in the coronation ceremony.\u0027 Jill\u0027s eyes flicked briefly to Lissa--still stone-faced--and then back to me. \"What does \"take part\u0027 mean, exactly? What would I have to do?\u0027 \"Nothing hard,\u0027 I assured her. \"It\u0027s just some formalities that are usually done by family members. Ceremonial stuff. Like you did with the vote.\u0027 I hadn\u0027t witnessed that, but Jill had apparently only had to stand by Lissa\u0027s side to show family strength. Such a small thing for a law to hinge on. \"Mostly, it\u0027s about being on display and putting on a good face.\u0027 \"Well,\u0027 mused Jill, \"I\u0027ve been doing that for most of this week.\u0027 \"I\u0027ve been doing it for most of my life,\u0027 said Lissa. Jill looked startled. Again, I felt at a loss without the bond. Lissa\u0027s tone hadn\u0027t made her meaning clear. Was it a challenge to Jill--that the girl hadn\u0027t faced nearly what Lissa had? Or was it supposed to be sympathy for Jill\u0027s lack of experience? \"You\u0027ll ... you\u0027ll get used to it,\u0027 I said. \"Over time.\u0027 Jill shook her head, a small and bitter smile on her face. \"I don\u0027t know about that.\u0027 I didn\u0027t either. I wasn\u0027t sure how one handled the kind of situation she\u0027d been dropped into. My mind rapidly ran through a list of more meaningless, kind things I could say, but Lissa finally took over. \"I know how weird this is,\u0027 she said. She determinedly met Jill\u0027s green eyes--the only feature the sisters shared, I decided. Jill had the makings of a future Emily. Lissa carried a mix of her parents\u0027 traits. \"This is weird for me too. I don\u0027t know what to do.\u0027 \"What do you want?\u0027 asked Jill quietly. I heard the real question. Jill wanted to know if Lissa wanted her. Lissa had been devastated by the death of her brother ... but a surprise illegitimate sibling was no substitute for Andre. I tried to imagine what it would be like to be in either girl\u0027s place. I tried and failed. \"I don\u0027t know,\u0027 admitted Lissa. \"I don\u0027t know what I want.\u0027 Jill nodded, dropping her gaze, but not before I caught sight of the emotion playing across her face. Disappointment--yet, Lissa\u0027s answer hadn\u0027t entirely been unexpected. Jill asked the next best thing. \"Do you want ... do you want me to be in the ceremonies?\u0027 The question hung in the air. It was a good one. It was the reason we\u0027d come here, but did Lissa actually want this? Studying her, I still wasn\u0027t sure. I didn\u0027t know if she was just following protocol, trying to get Jill to play a role expected among royalty. In this case, there was no law that said Jill had to do anything. She simply had to exist. \"Yes,\u0027 said Lissa at last. I heard the truth in her words, and something inside of me lightened. Lissa didn\u0027t just want Jill for the sake of image. A part of Lissa wanted Jill in her life--but managing that would be difficult. Still, it was a start, and Jill seemed to recognize that. \"Okay,\u0027 she said. \"Just tell me what I need to do.\u0027 It occurred to me that Jill\u0027s youth and nervousness were deceptive. There were sparks of bravery and boldness within her, sparks that I felt certain would grow. She really was a Dragomir. Lissa looked relieved, but I think it was because she\u0027d made a tiny step of progress with her sister. It had nothing to do with the coronation. \"Someone else will explain it all. I\u0027m not really sure what you do, to be honest. But Rose is right. It won\u0027t be hard.\u0027 Jill simply nodded. \"Thank you,\u0027 said Lissa. She stood up, and both Jill and I rose with her. \"I ... I really appreciate it.\u0027 That awkwardness returned as the three of us stood there. It would have been a good moment for the sisters to hug, but even though both seemed pleased at their progress, neither was ready for that. When Lissa looked at Jill, she still saw her father with another woman. When Jill looked at Lissa, she saw her life completely turned upside down--a life once shy and private now out there for the world to gawk at. I couldn\u0027t change her fate, but hugging I could do. Heedless of my stitches, I put my arms around the young girl. \"Thanks,\u0027 I said, echoing Lissa. \"This\u0027ll all be okay. You\u0027ll see.\u0027 Jill nodded yet again, and with no more to discuss, Lissa and I moved toward the door. Jill\u0027s voice brought us to a halt. \"Hey ... what happens after the coronation? To me? To us?\u0027 I glanced at Lissa. Another good question. Lissa turned toward Jill but still wasn\u0027t making direct eye contact. \"We\u0027ll ... we\u0027ll get to know each other. Things\u0027ll get better.\u0027 The smile that appeared on Jill\u0027s face was genuine--small, but genuine. \"Okay,\u0027 she said. There was hope in that smile too. Hope and relief. \"I\u0027d like that.\u0027 As for me, I had to hide a frown. I apparently could function without the bond because I could tell, with absolute confidence, that Lissa wasn\u0027t exactly giving the whole truth. What wasn\u0027t she telling Jill? Lissa did want things to be better, I was certain, even if she wasn\u0027t sure how. But there was something ... something small that Lissa wasn\u0027t revealing to either of us, something that made me think Lissa didn\u0027t actually believe things would improve. Out of nowhere, a strange echo from Victor Dashkov rang through my mind about Jill. If she has any sense, Vasilisa will send her away. I didn\u0027t know why I remembered that, but it sent a chill through me. The sisters were both mustering smiles, and I hastily did as well, not wanting either to know my concerns. Lissa and I left after that, heading back toward my room. My little outing had been more tiring than I expected, and as much as I hated to admit it, I couldn\u0027t wait to lie down again. When we reached my room, I still hadn\u0027t decided if I should ask Lissa about Jill or wait to get Dimitri\u0027s opinion. The decision was taken from me when we found an unexpected visitor waiting: Adrian. He sat on my bed, head tipped back as though he was completely consumed by studying the ceiling. I knew better. He\u0027d known the instant we approached--or at least when Lissa approached. We stopped in the doorway, and he finally turned toward us. He looked like he hadn\u0027t slept in a while. Dark shadows hung under his eyes, and his cute face was hardened with lines of fatigue. Whether it was mental or physical fatigue, I couldn\u0027t say. Nonetheless, his lazy smile was the same as ever. \"Your majesty,\u0027 he said grandly. \"Stop,\u0027 scoffed Lissa. \"You should know better.\u0027 \"I\u0027ve never known better,\u0027 he countered. \"You should know that.\u0027 I saw Lissa start to smile; then she glanced at me and grew serious, realizing this was hardly let\u0027s-have-fun-with-Adrian time. \"Well,\u0027 she said uneasily, not looking very queenly at all. \"I\u0027ve got some things to do.\u0027 She was going to bolt, I realized. I\u0027d gone with her for her family chat, but she was going to abandon me now. Just as well, though. This conversation with Adrian had been inevitable, and I\u0027d brought it on myself. I had to finish this on my own, just as I\u0027d told Dimitri. \"I\u0027m sure you do,\u0027 I said. Her face turned hesitant, as though she was suddenly reconsidering. She felt guilty. She was worried about me and wanted to stand by me. I lightly touched her arm. \"It\u0027s okay, Liss. I\u0027ll be okay. Go.\u0027 She squeezed my hand in return, her eyes wishing me good luck. She told Adrian goodbye and left, closing the door behind her. It was just him and me now. He stayed on my bed, watching me carefully. He still wore the smile he\u0027d given Lissa, like this was no big deal. I knew otherwise and made no attempts to hide my feelings. Standing still made me tired, so I sat down in a nearby chair, nervously wondering what to say. \"Adrian--\u0027 \"Let\u0027s start with this, little dhampir,\u0027 he said cordially. \"Was it going on before you left Court?\u0027 It took me a moment to follow that abrupt Adrian conversation format. He was asking if Dimitri and I had gotten back together before my arrest. I shook my head slowly. \"No. I was with you. Just you.\u0027 True, I\u0027d been a mess of emotions, but my intentions had been firm. \"Well. That\u0027s something,\u0027 he said. Some of his pleasantness was starting to slip. I smelled it then, ever so faintly: alcohol and smoke. \"Better some rekindling of sparks in the heat of battle or quest or whatever than you cheating right in front of me.\u0027 I shook my head more urgently now. \"No, I swear. I didn\u0027t--nothing happened then ... not until--\u0027 I hesitated on how to phrase my next words. \"Later?\u0027 he guessed. \"Which makes it okay? \"No! Of course not. I ...\u0027 Damn it. I\u0027d screwed up. Just because I hadn\u0027t cheated on Adrian at Court didn\u0027t mean that I hadn\u0027t cheated on him later. You could phrase it however you wanted, but let\u0027s face it: sleeping with another guy in a hotel room was pretty much cheating if you had a boyfriend. It didn\u0027t matter if that guy was the love of your life or not. \"I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I said. It was the simplest and most appropriate thing I could say. \"I\u0027m sorry. What I did was wrong. I didn\u0027t mean for it to happen. I thought ... I really thought he and I were done. I was with you. I wanted to be with you. And then, I realized that--\u0027 \"No, no--stop.\u0027 Adrian held up a hand, his voice tight now as his cool facade continued to crumble. \"I really do not want to hear about the great revelation you had about how you guys were always meant to be together or whatever it was.\u0027 I stayed silent because, well, that kind of had been my revelation. Adrian ran a hand through his hair. \"Really, it\u0027s my fault. It was there. A hundred times there. How often did I see it? I knew. It kept happening. Over and over, you\u0027d say you were through with him ... and over and over, I\u0027d believe it ... no matter what my eyes showed me. No matter what my heart told me. My. Fault.\u0027 It was that slightly unhinged rambling--not that nervous kind of Jill\u0027s, but the unstable kind that worried me about how close he was getting to the edge of insanity. An edge I might very well be pushing him toward. I wanted to go over to him but had the sense to stay seated. \"Adrian, I--\u0027 \"I loved you!\u0027 he yelled. He jumped up out of his chair so quickly I never saw it coming. \"I loved you, and you destroyed me. You took my heart and ripped it up. You might as well have staked me!\u0027 The change in his features also caught me by surprise. His voice filled the room. So much grief, so much anger. So unlike the usual Adrian. He strode toward me, hand clasped over his chest. \"I. Loved. You. And you used me the whole time.\u0027 \"No, no. It\u0027s not true.\u0027 I wasn\u0027t afraid of Adrian, but in the face of that emotion, I found myself cringing. \"I wasn\u0027t using you. I loved you. I still do, but--\u0027 He looked disgusted. \"Rose, come on.\u0027 \"I mean it! I do love you.\u0027 Now I stood up, pain or no, trying to look him in the eye. \"I always will, but we\u0027re not ... I don\u0027t think we work as a couple.\u0027 \"That\u0027s a bullshit breakup line, and you know it.\u0027 He was kind of right, but I thought back to moments with Dimitri ... how well we worked in sync, how he always seemed to get exactly what I felt. I meant what I\u0027d said: I did love Adrian. He was wonderful, in spite of all his flaws. Because, really, who didn\u0027t have flaws? He and I had fun together. There was affection, but we weren\u0027t matched in the way Dimitri and I were. \"I\u0027m not ... I\u0027m not the one for you,\u0027 I said weakly. \"Because you\u0027re with another guy?\u0027 \"No, Adrian. Because ... I don\u0027t. I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t ...\u0027 I was fumbling, badly. I didn\u0027t know how to explain what I felt, how you could care about someone and love hanging out with them--but still not work as a couple. \"I don\u0027t balance you like you need.\u0027 \"What the hell does that mean?\u0027 he exclaimed. My heart ached for him, and I was so sorry for what I\u0027d done ... but this was the truth of it all. \"The fact that you have to ask says it all. When you find that person ... you\u0027ll know.\u0027 I didn\u0027t add that with his history, he\u0027d probably have a number of false starts before finding that person. \"And I know this sounds like another bullshit breakup line, but I really would like to be your friend.\u0027 He stared at me for several heavy seconds and then laughed--though there wasn\u0027t much humor in it. \"You know what\u0027s great? You\u0027re serious. Look at your face.\u0027 He gestured, as though I actually could examine myself. \"You really think it\u0027s that easy, that I can sit here and watch your happy ending. That I can watch you getting everything you want as you lead your charmed life.\u0027 \"Charmed!\u0027 The guilt and sympathy warring within me got a little kick of anger. \"Hardly. Do you know what I\u0027ve gone through in the last year?\u0027 I\u0027d watched Mason die, fought in the St. Vladimir\u0027s attack, been captured by Strigoi in Russia, and then lived on the run as a wanted murderess. That didn\u0027t sound charmed at all. \"And yet, here you are, triumphant after it all. You survived death and freed yourself from the bond. Lissa\u0027s queen. You got the guy and your happily ever after.\u0027 I turned my back to him and stalked away. \"Adrian, what do you want me to say? I can apologize forever, but there\u0027s nothing else I can do here. I never wanted to hurt you; I can\u0027t say that enough. But the rest? Do you really expect me to be sad about everything else having worked out? Should I wish I was still I was accused of murder?\u0027 \"No,\u0027 he said. \"I don\u0027t want you to suffer. Much. But the next time you\u0027re in bed with Belikov, stop a moment and remember that not everyone made out as well as you did.\u0027 I turned back to face him. \"Adrian, I never--\u0027 \"Not just me, little dhampir,\u0027 he added quietly. \"There\u0027s been a lot of collateral damage along the way while you battled against the world. I was a victim, obviously. But what about Jill? What happens to her now that you\u0027ve abandoned her to the royal wolves? And Eddie? Have you thought about him? And where\u0027s your Alchemist?\u0027 Every word he slung at me was an arrow, piercing my heart more than the bullets had. The fact that he\u0027d referred to Jill by her name instead of \"Jailbait\u0027 carried an extra hurt. I was already toting plenty of guilt about her, but the others ... well, they were a mystery. I\u0027d heard rumors about Eddie but hadn\u0027t seen him since my return. He was clear of James\u0027s death, but killing a Moroi--when others still thought he might have been brought in alive--carried a heavy stigma. Eddie\u0027s previous insubordination-- thanks to me--also damned him, even if it had all been for \"the greater good.\u0027 As queen, Lissa could only do so much. The guardians served the Moroi, but it was customary for the Moroi to step back and let the guardians manage their own people. Eddie wasn\u0027t being dismissed or imprisoned ... but what assignment would they give him? Hard to say. Sydney ... she was an even greater mystery. Where\u0027s your Alchemist? The goings- on of that group were beyond me, beyond my world. I remembered her face that last time I\u0027d seen her, back in the hotel--strong but sad. I knew she and the other Alchemists had been released since then, but her expression had said she wasn\u0027t out of trouble yet. And Victor Dashkov? Where did he fit in? I wasn\u0027t sure. Evil or not, he was still someone who\u0027d suffered as a result of my actions, and the events surrounding his death would stay with me forever. Collateral damage. I\u0027d brought down a lot of people with me, intentionally or no. But, as Adrian\u0027s words continued sinking into me, one of them suddenly gave me pause. \"Victim,\u0027 I said slowly. \"That\u0027s the difference between you and me.\u0027 \"Huh?\u0027 He\u0027d been watching me closely while I\u0027d considered the fates of my friends and was caught off guard now. \"What are you talking about?\u0027 \"You said you were a victim. That\u0027s why ... that\u0027s why ultimately, you and I aren\u0027t matched for each other. In spite of everything that\u0027s happened, I\u0027ve never thought of myself that way. Being a victim means you\u0027re powerless. That you won\u0027t take action. Always ... always I\u0027ve done something to fight for myself ... for others. No matter what.\u0027 I\u0027d never seen such outrage on Adrian\u0027s face. \"That\u0027s what you think of me? That I\u0027m lazy? Powerless?\u0027 Not exactly. But I had a feeling that after this conversation, he would run off to the comfort of his cigarettes and alcohol and maybe whatever female company he could find. \"No,\u0027 I said. \"I think you\u0027re amazing. I think you\u0027re strong. But I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve realized it--or learned how to use any of that.\u0027 And, I wanted to add, I wasn\u0027t the person who could inspire that in him. \"This,\u0027 he said, moving toward the door, \"was the last thing I expected. You destroy my life and then feed me inspirational philosophy.\u0027 I felt horrible, and it was one of those moments where I wished my mouth wouldn\u0027t just blurt out the first thing on my mind. I\u0027d learned a lot of control--but not quite enough. \"I\u0027m just telling you the truth. You\u0027re better than this ... better than whatever it is you\u0027re going to do now.\u0027 Adrian rested his hand on the doorknob and gave me a rueful look. \"Rose, I\u0027m an addict with no work ethic who\u0027s likely going to go insane. I\u0027m not like you. I\u0027m not a superhero.\u0027 \"Not yet,\u0027 I said. He scoffed, shook his head, and opened the door. Just before leaving, he gave me one more backward glance. \"The contract\u0027s null and void, by the way.\u0027 I felt like I\u0027d been slapped in the face. And in one of those rare moments, Rose Hathaway was rendered speechless. I had no witty quips, no elaborate explanations, and no profound insight. Adrian left, and I wondered if I\u0027d ever see him again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-35.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
