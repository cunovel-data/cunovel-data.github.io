{"id":110933,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"I SPRANG UP FROM THE bed, relieved that I didn\u0027t fall over. My head still hurt, but I no longer felt dizzy, which hopefully meant I really had evaded a concussion. Glancing at an alarm clock as I left Sonya\u0027s bedroom, I saw that I\u0027d been in Lissa\u0027s head for a few hours. Her test had been far more extensive than I\u0027d realized.\\n\\n In the living room, I found an almost comical sight. Victor and Robert stood there, in the flesh, taking in the surrounding details. Even Robert seemed to be with us mentally this time. Only, whereas Victor was studying everything in his calculating way, Robert\u0027s attention was fixed on Sonya. His eyes bugged out in astonishment. Dimitri, meanwhile, hadn\u0027t altered his position near Sonya or put away the stake at her throat. It was clear from his stance and watchful gaze, however, that he regarded the brothers as a new threat and was trying--impossibly--to stay on guard against everything. He seemed relieved to see me and have some backup.\\n\\n Sonya had gone perfectly still within her chains, which I didn\u0027t like at all. It made me think she was planning something. Her red eyes narrowed.\\n\\n The whole situation was tense and dangerous, but a tiny part of me felt smug satisfaction as I studied Victor more closely. The dream meetings had been deceptive. Just as I could shift my appearance in dreams, Victor had made himself look stronger and healthier in those visits than he actually was in real life. Age, disease, and life on the run were taking their toll. Dark shadows lined his eyes, and his graying hair seemed thinner than it had a month ago. He looked haggard and tired, but I knew he was still dangerous.\\n\\n \"So,\u0027 I said, hands on hips. \"You managed to find us.\u0027\\n\\n \"There\u0027s one lake in this town,\u0027 said Victor. \"One blue house. Maybe you had trouble with those directions, but for the rest of us, it wasn\u0027t that difficult.\u0027\\n\\n \"Well, if you\u0027re so smart, what\u0027s your plan now?\u0027 I asked. I was trying to stall as I frantically thought about what my plan was. I\u0027d wanted to capture Victor and Robert but didn\u0027t know how. Since we had to split our attention between them and Sonya, Dimitri and I couldn\u0027t team up. I wished we had leftover chain. Aside from physically subduing the brothers, we would also specifically need to restrain their hands to reduce their ability to use magic.\\n\\n \"Since you\u0027re so smart,\u0027 countered Victor, \"I assumed you\u0027d have already obtained the needed information.\u0027\\n\\n I gestured toward Sonya. \"She\u0027s not exactly forthcoming.\u0027\\n\\n Victor\u0027s eyes fell on her. \"Sonya Karp. You\u0027ve changed since I last saw you.\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to kill you all,\u0027 Sonya snarled. \"And consume you one by one. Normally, I\u0027d start with the human and work up to the Moroi, but ...\u0027 She glanced at Dimitri and me, her face full of rage. \"I think I\u0027ll save you two for last and drag out your suffering.\u0027 She paused and almost comically added, \"You\u0027ve annoyed me the most.\u0027\\n\\n \"Do all Strigoi go through some boot camp and learn all the same threats? It\u0027s a wonder you don\u0027t cackle too.\u0027 I turned back to Victor. \"See? Not that easy. We\u0027ve tried everything. Beating it out, torturing it out. Sydney went through the names of all her relatives. No reaction.\u0027\\n\\n Victor studied Sydney in detail for the first time. \"So. Your pet Alchemist.\u0027\\n\\n Sydney didn\u0027t move. I knew she had to be scared of facing someone who was both a vampire and a dangerous criminal. I had to give her points for meeting his stare unflinchingly.\\n\\n \"Young,\u0027 Victor mused. \"But of course she would be. I imagine it\u0027s the only way you could manipulate her into this little escapade.\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here by choice,\u0027 replied Sydney. Her expression stayed calm and confident. \"No one manipulated me.\u0027 Abe\u0027s blackmail wasn\u0027t really relevant at the moment.\\n\\n \"Look, if you wanted to keep torturing me with your not-funny comments, you could have just kept invading my dreams,\u0027 I snapped. \"If you don\u0027t have anything useful to offer, then get out of here and let us wait until hunger weakens Sonya.\u0027 And by get out of here, I meant: foolishly think you\u0027re going to leave so that I can knock your heads together and drag you back to the guardians.\\n\\n \"We can help,\u0027 said Victor. He touched his brother lightly on the arm. Robert flinched, jerking his eyes from Sonya to Victor. \"Your methods were destined to fail. If you want answers, there\u0027s only one way to--\u0027\\n\\n Sonya made her move. Dimitri was still right next to her, but he\u0027d also been keeping an eye on the rest of us. And of course, I\u0027d been completely focused on the Victor drama as well. It was probably the best opening Sonya could have hoped for.\\n\\n With crazy Strigoi strength, she bucked up from the chair. The chain was wrapped around her over and over, but her quick movement and strength were enough to snap the chain in two places. The rest still encircled her, but I knew perfectly well even one opening was enough for her to eventually bust out. Distracted or not, Dimitri was on her in a flash, and a second later, so was I. She was flailing in the chair, using every bit of her strength and speed to shake off the chains. If she got loose, I knew she\u0027d put up another fierce fight. Dimitri and I met eyes briefly, and I knew we were thinking the same things. First, how were we going to re-restrain her? The chain could probably be rebound, but we\u0027d need to unwind it and start over, which would be next to impossible. We also both knew he and I might not be able to take her down a second time, and now we had innocents around. They couldn\u0027t fight, but Sonya might be able to use them to her advantage somehow. All we could do was try to keep her down. Holding her against a flat surface like the floor would have been much easier than the unwieldy recliner. It shook as she fought against us, and we struggled to get a good position on the chair. Dimitri had his stake-- I\u0027d set mine down earlier--and he raked it against her skin, giving us some advantage in the struggle. She screamed in rage, and I clung to the hope we might tire her out. Probably not. We\u0027d break first. My aching head was proof enough that I wasn\u0027t in peak condition.\\n\\n I saw a flash of movement in my periphery, setting off new alarms. Robert Doru was heading toward us--and he had a silver stake in his hand. The sight was so bizarre and unexpected that I was slow to alert Dimitri. When my sluggish mind suddenly kicked back to life, it was too late.\\n\\n \"No!\u0027 I shrieked, seeing Robert raise the stake. \"Don\u0027t kill her!\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri turned and saw Robert then, but there was nothing he could do. Dimitri and I had created the perfect opportunity. We were holding Sonya still, and with her chest vulnerable, Robert had a clean shot. Frantically, I wondered what to do. If I stopped him, I\u0027d release Sonya. If I didn\u0027t stop him, he might kill our only chance at finding out who--\\n\\n Too late. The stake plunged down with a force that astonished me. Lissa had had a very difficult time staking Dimitri, and I\u0027d assumed the same would be true for someone like Robert, who was older and seemed so fragile. But, no. He still had to use two hands, but the stake went firmly into Sonya\u0027s chest, piercing her heart.\\n\\n Sonya let out an intense scream. A brilliant, blinding white light suddenly filled the room, just as an unseen force blasted me away. I hit a wall, my brain barely registering the pain. The small house shook, and with one hand, I tried to grab something and brace myself. I squeezed my eyes shut but could still see starbursts. Time slowed. My heartbeat slowed.\\n\\n Then--it all stopped. Everything. The light. The tremors. I breathed normally. All was quiet and still, as though I\u0027d imagined what had just happened.\\n\\n I blinked, trying to bring my eyes back into focus and assess the situation. I did my best to scramble clumsily to my feet and saw Dimitri was doing the same. He looked like he\u0027d also been knocked over but had caught the wall for support, rather than smashing into it. Robert was lying flat out on the floor, and Victor rushed over to help him. Sydney just stood frozen.\\n\\n And Sonya?\\n\\n \"Unbelievable,\u0027 I whispered.\\n\\n Sonya was still in the armchair, and from the way she was sitting back, it was obvious that she\u0027d been blasted by the same force that had hit the rest of us. The chains were still around her, but she\u0027d stopped struggling. On her lap was the silver stake Robert had held only moments ago. Sonya managed to wiggle a hand out of the chain, just enough for her fingers to brush against the stake\u0027s surface. Her eyes widened with wonder--eyes that were a rich, azure blue.\\n\\n Robert had brought Sonya Karp back to life. She was no longer Strigoi.\\n\\n When Lissa had saved Dimitri, I\u0027d felt the magic\u0027s power through the bond, giving me the full and overwhelming experience of it all. Witnessing it now, without the firsthand knowledge provided from Lissa, was still just as incredible. Victor was preoccupied with Robert, but the rest of us couldn\u0027t stop staring at Sonya in amazement. I kept looking for anything--anything--that might give the slightest hint of her previous existence.\\n\\n There was none. Her skin bore the typical Moroi paleness, but it was still filled with the warmth of life, with the faintest tinge of color--not like the Strigoi, who were completely devoid of pigment. Her eyes were bloodshot, but that was from her rapidly forming tears. There was no red ring around her irises. And the look in those eyes ... there was no cruelty or malice. They were not the eyes of someone who had just threatened to kill us all. Her eyes were all shock and fear and confusion. I couldn\u0027t tear my gaze from her.\\n\\n A miracle. Another miracle. Even after seeing Lissa restore Dimitri, some secret part of me had believed I would never witness anything like it again. That was how miracles worked. Once in a lifetime. There\u0027d been a lot of talk about using spirit to save Strigoi everywhere, talk that had faded when other drama--such as the murder of a queen-- took precedence at Court. The shortage of spirit users had also made the idea unpopular, and besides, everyone knew the difficulties involved with a Moroi staking a Strigoi. If trained guardians died fighting Strigoi, how could a Moroi stake one? Well, here was the answer: a subdued Strigoi. A Moroi could manage staking one with two hands, especially with guardian backup. The possibilities made me reel. Robert\u0027s magic was strong, but he was old and frail. Yet, if he had still done this, could any spirit user? He\u0027d almost made it look easy. Could Adrian do it? Could Lissa do it again?\\n\\n A miracle. Sonya Karp was a living, breathing miracle.\\n\\n And suddenly, she began screaming.\\n\\n It started off as kind of a low wail and rapidly grew in volume. The noise snapped me to attention, but I didn\u0027t exactly know how to respond. Dimitri did. His stake fell from his hand, and he rushed to Sonya\u0027s side, where he began trying to free her from the chains. She floundered at his touch, but her efforts no longer packed the supernatural strength of an undead monster seeking revenge. These were the motions of someone desperately, terribly afraid.\\n\\n I\u0027d wrapped those chains pretty securely, but Dimitri had them off in seconds. Once Sonya was free, he sat in the chair and pulled her to him, letting her bury her face against his chest and sob. I swallowed. Dimitri had also wept when he had been changed back. An odd image of newborn babies flashed through my mind. Was crying the natural reaction for anyone being born--or, in this case, reborn--into the world?\\n\\n A sudden movement grabbed my attention. Sydney\u0027s eyes were wide, and she was actually moving toward Dimitri--to stop him. \"What are you doing?\u0027 she cried. \"Don\u0027t release her!\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri ignored Sydney, and I caught hold of her, pulling her back. \"It\u0027s okay, it\u0027s okay,\u0027 I said. Sydney was the most stable factor in this whole operation. I couldn\u0027t have her freaking out. \"She\u0027s not Strigoi. Look. Look at her. She\u0027s Moroi.\u0027\\n\\n Sydney slowly shook her head. \"She can\u0027t be. I just saw her.\u0027\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what happened to Dimitri. Exactly the same. You don\u0027t think he\u0027s a Strigoi, do you? You trust him.\u0027 I released my hold on her, and she stayed put, her face wary.\\n\\n Looking down at the brothers, I realized theirs might be a more serious situation than I had realized. Robert, while not a Strigoi, looked pale enough to be one. His eyes were vacant, drool escaping his partially open mouth. I reassessed my earlier observation about Robert making Strigoi restoration look easy. He\u0027d staked her like a pro, but obviously, there were a few side effects. Victor was trying to support his brother and murmured soothing and encouraging words. And on Victor\u0027s face ... well, there was a look of compassion and fear that I\u0027d never seen before. My brain didn\u0027t entirely know how to reconcile it with my well-defined and villainous image of him. He seemed like a real person.\\n\\n Victor glanced up at me, his lips twisting into a bitter smile. \"What, no witty quips now? You should be happy. We\u0027ve given you what you wanted. You need answers from Sonya Karp?\u0027 He nodded toward her. \"Go get them. They\u0027ve certainly come at a high price.\u0027\\n\\n \"No!\u0027 exclaimed Dimitri. He still held Sonya against him, but his gentle expression turned hard at Victor\u0027s words. \"Are you crazy? Didn\u0027t you see what just happened?\u0027\\n\\n Victor arched an eyebrow. \"Yes. I noticed.\u0027\\n\\n \"She\u0027s in no condition to answer anything! She\u0027s in shock. Leave her alone.\u0027\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t act like she\u0027s the one who\u0027s suffering here,\u0027 snapped Victor. Turning back to Robert, Victor helped his brother stand and go toward the couch. Robert barely managed it, his legs trembling and then giving way as he sat down. Victor put an arm around Robert. \"You\u0027ll be all right. Everything\u0027s all right.\u0027\\n\\n \"Will he be?\u0027 I asked uncertainly. Robert didn\u0027t look like he was in all that good of shape. My earlier thoughts about spirit users saving Strigoi continued growing unrealistic. \"He ... he did it before and recovered, right? And Lissa\u0027s fine.\u0027\\n\\n \"Robert was much younger--as is Vasilisa,\u0027 replied Victor, patting Robert\u0027s shoulder. \"And this is hardly a simple spell. Doing it even once is monumental. Twice? Well, you and I both know how spirit works, and this feat takes a toll on both body and mind. Robert has made a great sacrifice for you.\u0027\\n\\n He had, I supposed. \"Thank you, Robert,\u0027 I said. The words came hesitantly to my lips. Robert didn\u0027t seem to hear.\\n\\n Dimitri stood up, lifting Sonya easily in his arms. She was still crying, but her sobs were quieter now.\\n\\n \"She needs to rest,\u0027 he said gruffly. \"Believe me, you have no idea what\u0027s going on inside her right now.\u0027\\n\\n \"Oh, I believe you,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re idiots,\u0027 snapped Victor. \"Both of you.\u0027\\n\\n It was a wonder Dimitri\u0027s glare didn\u0027t pin Victor to the floor. \"No interrogation yet.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded my agreement, not knowing what else to do. When Lissa had changed Dimitri, she\u0027d taken on a fierce, similarly protective attitude. He might not have been the one to change Sonya, but he was the only one here who had any idea what she was going through. I knew he\u0027d had a hard adjustment and that the initial effects of the restoration had been disorienting. That wasn\u0027t even taking into account the subsequent depression.\\n\\n He swept past all of us, taking Sonya to her bedroom. Sydney watched them go and then glanced over to the sofa, where Victor still had his arm wrapped around his brother. The Alchemist met my eyes wonderingly.\\n\\n \"I heard ... but I didn\u0027t believe.\u0027\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\u0027 I told her, \"I still don\u0027t. It goes against every rule of the universe.\u0027 To my surprise, she touched the small gold cross around her neck. \"Some rules are bigger than the universe.\u0027\\n\\n Victor rose from the couch, apparently satisfied Robert was resting. I tensed up. Miracles aside, he was still a criminal, one I intended to capture. He took a step toward me, pitching his voice low.\\n\\n \"Sorry to interrupt Metaphysics 101, but you need to listen to me,\u0027 he said. \"Be careful, Rose. Very careful. A lot rests on you now. Don\u0027t let your pet wolf keep you from finding out what Sonya knows.\u0027\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s right,\u0027 I exclaimed. \"Its been five minutes! What she went through ... what they both went through ... well, it\u0027s kind of a big deal. Literally life-changing. He had to recover too and adjust to being saved. Once she does, she\u0027ll help us.\u0027\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\u0027 he asked, narrowing his eyes. \"Will she think she\u0027s been saved? You forget: Belikov was turned against his will. She wasn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \"W-what are you saying? That she\u0027s going to try to become Strigoi again?\u0027\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I\u0027m saying get your answers soon. And don\u0027t leave her alone.\u0027\\n\\n With that, Victor turned and headed toward the kitchen. He soon returned with a glass of water. Robert drank it greedily and then fell into a heavy sleep. I sighed and leaned against a wall near Sydney, totally worn out. I still hurt from the earlier fight.\\n\\n \"What now?\u0027 asked Sydney.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t know. We wait, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri returned a little while later and spared a small glance for Robert. \"She\u0027s sleeping too,\u0027 he told me. \"The transformation ... it\u0027s difficult.\u0027 I could see a haunted look in his eyes and wondered what memory was tormenting him now. The memory of being changed? The memory of being Strigoi?\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think we should leave Sonya alone,\u0027 I said. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Victor smirk. \"Someone should stay with her in case she wakes up. She won\u0027t know what\u0027s going on.\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri didn\u0027t answer for a few seconds as he scrutinized me. He knew me well enough to sense there might be something else on my mind. Fortunately, he couldn\u0027t find a fault in my logic.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. Do you mind sitting with her?\u0027 he asked Sydney.\\n\\n I groped for something to say. No, no. Not Sydney. If Sonya did turn on us, we needed someone else on guard--someone who could fight back. Sydney, probably guessing my problem, saved me from lying to Dimitri--or from telling him the truth about my concerns.\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t know me. It might make things worse when she wakes up. Besides ...\u0027 Sydney put on that disgusted expression that Alchemists excelled at. \"I don\u0027t really feel that comfortable with someone who was a monster five minutes ago.\u0027\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not Strigoi,\u0027 he exclaimed. \"She\u0027s absolutely, completely Moroi again!\u0027 Even I felt a little cowed by the harshness of his voice, but I wasn\u0027t entirely surprised at his vehement reaction. He\u0027d had a hard time convincing others he\u0027d changed. His face softened a little. \"I know it\u0027s hard to believe, but she really has changed.\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stay with her then,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \"No, no.\u0027 Dimitri shook his head. \"Sydney\u0027s right about one thing: Sonya might be confused. It\u0027s better if someone\u0027s there who understands what\u0027s happened.\u0027 I started to argue that I was the only one Sonya really knew but then decided I\u0027d rather stay with the brothers. They seemed harmless now, but I didn\u0027t trust them. Dimitri apparently didn\u0027t either. He took a few steps forward and leaned down, speaking only an inch from my ear.\\n\\n \"Keep an eye on them,\u0027 he murmured. \"Robert\u0027s down right now but might recover sooner than we think.\u0027\\n\\n \"I know.\u0027\\n\\n He started to turn, then glanced back at me. His commander face had softened into something thoughtful and awestruck. \"Rose?\u0027\\n\\n \"Yeah?\u0027\\n\\n \"That ... was that what it was like when Lissa changed me?\u0027\\n\\n \"More or less.\u0027\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t realize ... it was ...\u0027 He struggled for words. It was uncharacteristic. \"The way that light filled the room, the way she changed. Seeing that life emerge from death ... it was ...\u0027\\n\\n \"Beautiful?\u0027\\n\\n He nodded. \"Life like that ... you don\u0027t--no, you can\u0027t waste it.\u0027\\n\\n \"No,\u0027 I agreed. \"You can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n I saw something shift in him then. It was small, just like in the alley, but I knew then another piece of the Strigoi-trauma had peeled away.\\n\\n He said no more, and I watched as he walked back down the hall. With nothing else to do, Sydney sat down cross-legged on the floor, holding a book in her lap. It was closed, her thoughts clearly elsewhere. Meanwhile, Victor sat back in the armchair and reclined it. He didn\u0027t look as bad as Robert, but lines of fatigue showed on both brothers. Good. The longer they were out of commission, the better. I brought in a chair from the kitchen so I could sit and survey the room. Everything was peaceful.\\n\\n I felt like a babysitter, which I suppose I kind of was. It had been a long day, and night soon turned the windows black. This made worried me. For all I knew, Sonya had some Strigoi pals who might stop by. The fact that Donovan knew her certainly indicated she wasn\u0027t a total outcast among them. It made me extra-vigilant, but at the same time, I was exhausted. The brothers were already asleep. Sydney, perhaps in an attempt to keep her human schedule, eventually found a spare blanket and pillow and curled up in a makeshift bed on the floor.\\n\\n And me? I was halfway between human and vampiric schedules. I had a feeling Dimitri was the same. Really, we were on a do-what\u0027s-necessary schedule, in which extensive sleep was not an option.\\n\\n A hum of excitement and astonishment suddenly sang through the bond. I sensed no danger or threat, but curiosity made me decide to check in with Lissa anyway. Even if I was in her mind, I knew my body would stay watchful, and I wanted to know how the rest of Lissa\u0027s test had gone.\\n\\n Beautifully, of course. She rode back to Court, exhausted but proud of herself. She wasn\u0027t the only one. The rest of her companions all wore similar expressions ... all except for Ava Drozdov. She had been the only one to break and use the cell phone to call for help. Lissa was surprised that Ava had cracked. After his earlier bitching, Marcus Lazar had seemed the most likely to bail. But no, the old man had managed it somehow, meaning he\u0027d continue on in the monarch trials. Ava refused to make eye contact with anyone, instead staring bleakly out the window as they traveled back to Court. She would still hold a Council spot, but her shot at being queen was gone.\\n\\n Lissa felt bad for her but couldn\u0027t spare too much concern. It was the way of the trials, the way they determined the best candidates. Besides, Lissa had her own issues. Staying out in the daytime had run contrary to the normal vampiric schedule. Now, she simply wanted to get back to Court, find her room, and sleep for a few hours. She wanted some peace.\\n\\n Instead, she found a mob waiting for her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-18.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \\n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
