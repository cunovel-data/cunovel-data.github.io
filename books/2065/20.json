{"id":110935,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"YOU SHOULD SLEEP.\u0027 Sydney\u0027s soft voice nearly made me leap out of my skin, proving that even while in Lissa\u0027s mind, I could still stay alert. I tuned back to Sonya\u0027s dark living room. Aside from Sydney, everything was quiet and at peace.\\n\\n \"You look like the walking dead,\u0027 she continued. \"And I don\u0027t say that lightly.\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to stay on watch,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll watch. You sleep.\u0027\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not trained like me,\u0027 I pointed out. \"You might miss something.\u0027\\n\\n \"Even I wouldn\u0027t miss Strigoi beating down the door,\u0027 she replied. \"Look, I know you guys are tough. You don\u0027t have to convince me. But I have a feeling things are going to get harder, and I don\u0027t want you passing out at some crucial moment. If you sleep now, you can relieve Dimitri later.\u0027\\n\\n Only the mention of Dimitri made me give in. We would need to relieve each other eventually. So, reluctantly, I crawled into Sydney\u0027s bed on the floor, giving her all sorts of instructions that I think she rolled her eyes at. I fell asleep almost instantly and then woke up just as quickly when I heard the sound of a door closing.\\n\\n I immediately sat upright, expecting to see Strigoi busting down the door. Instead, I found sunlight creeping in through the windows and Sydney watching me with amusement. In the living room, Robert was sitting up on the couch, rubbing his eyes. Victor was gone. I turned to Sydney in alarm.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in the bathroom,\u0027 she said, anticipating my question.\\n\\n That was the sound I\u0027d heard. I exhaled in relief and stood up, surprised at how even a few hours of sleep had energized me. If I only had food, I\u0027d be ready for anything. Sonya didn\u0027t have any, of course, but I settled for a glass of water in the kitchen. As I stood there drinking, I noticed that the Dashkov brothers had made themselves at home: coats hanging on hooks, car keys on the counter. I quietly grabbed hold of the keys and called for Sydney.\\n\\n She came in, and I slipped her the keys, trying not to let them rattle.\\n\\n \"Do you still know about cars?\u0027 I murmured.\\n\\n In one exquisite look, she told me that was a ridiculous and insulting question. \"Okay. Can you go do a grocery run? We\u0027re going to need food. And maybe on your way out, you can, um, make sure their car has engine trouble or something? Anything that keeps it here. But not something obvious, like slashed tires.\u0027\\n\\n She put the keys in her pocket. \"Easy. Got any food requests?\u0027\\n\\n I thought about it. \"Something with sugar. And coffee for Dimitri.\u0027\\n\\n \"Coffee\u0027s a given,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Victor stepped into the kitchen, his typically unconcerned expression making me think he hadn\u0027t heard me instructing Sydney to sabotage his car. \"Sydney\u0027s getting groceries,\u0027 I said, hoping to distract him before he might notice the missing keys. \"Need anything?\u0027\\n\\n \"A feeder would be nice, but barring that, Robert has an especial liking for Cheerios. The apple cinnamon kind.\u0027 He smiled at Sydney. \"I never thought I\u0027d see the day an Alchemist would be an errand girl. It\u0027s charming.\u0027\\n\\n Sydney opened her mouth, no doubt to make some biting comment, and I quickly shook my head. \"Just go,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n She went, and Victor soon returned to Robert\u0027s side. Convinced the brothers wouldn\u0027t be going anywhere in full daylight without a car, I decided it was time to check on Dimitri. To my surprise, Sonya was awake. She sat cross-legged on the bed with him, and the two spoke in hushed tones. Her hair was disheveled from both sleep and fighting, but otherwise, she showed no cuts or bruises from the battle. Dimitri had been the same after his transformation, escaping terrible burns. The power of a Strigoi restoration healed all injuries. Between my skinned legs and pseudo-concussion, I kind of wished someone had transformed me from a Strigoi.\\n\\n Sonya turned from Dimitri as I entered. A sequence of emotions passed across her face. Fear. Astonishment. Recognition.\\n\\n \"Rose?\u0027 There was hesitancy in the word, like she wondered if I was a hallucination.\\n\\n I forced a smile. \"It\u0027s good to see you again.\u0027 I chose not to add, \"Now that you\u0027re not trying to suck the life out of me.\u0027\\n\\n She averted her eyes down to her hands, studying her fingers like they were magical and wonderful. Of course, after being a monster, maybe having her \"old hands\u0027 back really was wondrous. The day after his change, Dimitri hadn\u0027t seemed quite so fragile, but he\u0027d certainly been in shock. That was also when he\u0027d grown depressed. Was she? Or did she want to turn again, as Victor had suggested?\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to say. It was all so strange and awkward. \"Sydney went for groceries,\u0027 I told Dimitri lamely. \"She also stayed up so that I could sleep last night.\u0027\\n\\n \"I know,\u0027 he said with a small smile. \"I got up once to check on you.\u0027\\n\\n I felt myself flushing, somehow embarrassed that I\u0027d been caught in weakness. \"You can rest too,\u0027 I told him. \"Get some breakfast, and then I\u0027ll keep an eye on everything. I have it on good authority that Victor\u0027s going to have car trouble. Also that Robert really likes Cheerios, so if you want some, you\u0027re out of luck. He doesn\u0027t seem like the sharing type.\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri\u0027s smile grew. Sonya suddenly lifted her head.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s another spirit user here,\u0027 she said, voice frantic. \"I can feel it. I remember him.\u0027 She looked between Dimitri and me. \"It\u0027s not safe. We\u0027re not safe. You shouldn\u0027t have us around.\u0027\\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s fine,\u0027 said Dimitri, voice so, so gentle. That tone was rare for him, but I\u0027d heard it before. He\u0027d used it on me in some of my most desperate moments. \"Don\u0027t worry.\u0027\\n\\n Sonya shook her head. \"No. You don\u0027t understand. We ... we\u0027re capable of terrible things. To ourselves, to others. It\u0027s why I changed, to stop the madness. And it did, except ... it was worse. In its way. The things I did ...\u0027\\n\\n There it was, the same remorse Dimitri had felt. Half-afraid he\u0027d start telling her there was no redemption for her either, I said, \"It wasn\u0027t you. You were controlled by something else.\u0027\\n\\n She buried her face in her hands. \"But I chose it. Me. I made it happen.\u0027\\n\\n \"That was spirit,\u0027 I said. \"It\u0027s hard to fight. Like you said, it can make you do terrible things. You weren\u0027t thinking clearly. Lissa battles with the same thing all the time.\u0027\\n\\n \"Vasilisa?\u0027 Sonya lifted her eyes and stared off into space. I think she was digging through memories. In fact, despite her ramblings now, I didn\u0027t believe she was quite as unstable as she\u0027d been just before becoming Strigoi. We\u0027d heard healings could lessen spirit\u0027s madness, and I think Robert\u0027s transformation had lightened some of the darkness within her for now. \"Yes, of course. Vasilisa has it too.\u0027 She turned to me in a panic. \"Did you help her? Did you get her out of there?\u0027\\n\\n \"I did,\u0027 I said, trying to emulate Dimitri\u0027s gentleness. Lissa and I fled St. Vladimir\u0027s for a while, partly because of warnings from Sonya. \"We left and then came back and, uh, were able to stop what was hunting her.\u0027 I didn\u0027t think it was a good idea for Sonya to know that the thing--or rather, person--hunting Lissa was now sitting out in the living room. I took a step forward. \"And you can help Lissa too. We need to know if--\u0027\\n\\n \"No,\u0027 said Dimitri. No gentleness now in the warning look he gave me. \"Not yet.\u0027\\n\\n \"But--\u0027\\n\\n \"Not yet.\u0027\\n\\n I shot him a glare in return but said no more. I was all for giving Sonya her recuperation time, but we didn\u0027t have forever. The clock was ticking, and we had to find out what Sonya knew. I felt like Dimitri would have been able to give us this information immediately after he\u0027d been changed back. Of course, he hadn\u0027t been unstable beforehand, so he\u0027d kind of had an edge. Still. We couldn\u0027t play house in Kentucky forever.\\n\\n \"Can I see my flowers?\u0027 asked Sonya. \"Can I go outside and see my flowers?\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri and I exchanged glances. \"Of course,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n We all moved toward the door, and that\u0027s when I had to ask. \"Why did you grow flowers when you were ... like you were?\u0027\\n\\n She paused. \"I\u0027ve always grown flowers.\u0027\\n\\n \"I know. I remember. They were gorgeous. The ones here are gorgeous too. Is that why ... I mean, did you just want a pretty garden, even as a Strigoi?\u0027\\n\\n The question was unexpected and seemed to throw her off. I was about to give up on an answer when she finally said, \"No. I never thought about pretty. They were ... I don\u0027t know. Something to do. I\u0027d always grown flowers. I had to see if I still could. It was like ... a test of my skills, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n I met Dimitri\u0027s eyes again. So. Beauty hadn\u0027t been part of her world. It was just like I\u0027d told him. Strigoi were notoriously arrogant, and it seemed the flowers had simply been a show of prowess. Growing them had also been a familiar habit for her, and I recalled how Dimitri had read Western novels while Strigoi. Being Strigoi might cost someone their sense of goodness and morality, but old behaviors and hobbies remained.\\n\\n We took her out to the living room, interrupting a conversation between Victor and Robert. Sonya and Robert both froze, sizing each other up. Victor gave us one of his knowing smiles.\\n\\n \"Up and around. Have we found out what we need yet?\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri shot him a look similar to what I\u0027d received when asking about interrogation. \"Not yet.\u0027\\n\\n Sonya dragged her gaze from Robert and moved quickly toward the patio door, pausing when she saw our shoddy patch job. \"You broke my door,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \"Collateral damage,\u0027 I said. In my periphery, I think Dimitri rolled his eyes.\\n\\n Needing no guidance from us, Sonya opened the door and stepped outside. With a gasp, she came to a halt and stared upward. The sky was a perfect, cloudless blue, and the sun had crossed the horizon now, illuminating everything in gold. I went outside too, feeling the warmth of that light on my skin. Some of the night\u0027s coldness lingered, but we were in store for a hot day.\\n\\n Everyone else came out too, but Sonya was oblivious. She lifted her hands upward, as though maybe she could grab hold of the sun and wrap it in her arms. \"It\u0027s so beautiful.\u0027 She finally looked away and met my eyes. \"Isn\u0027t it? Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?\u0027\\n\\n \"Beautiful,\u0027 I reiterated. For some reason, I felt both happy and sad.\\n\\n She walked around her yard, examining every plant and flower. She touched the petals and inhaled their fragrance. \"So different ...\u0027 she kept saying to herself. \"So different in the sun ...\u0027 Several especially caught her attention. \"These don\u0027t open at night! Do you see it? Do you see the colors? Can you smell that?\u0027\\n\\n The questions didn\u0027t seem to be for anyone in particular. We watched, all of us kind of hypnotized. At last, she settled into the patio chair, happily gazing around, lost in sensory overload--in that beauty that had been denied to her as a Strigoi. When it became obvious she wasn\u0027t leaving for a while, I turned to Dimitri and repeated Sydney\u0027s advice about him taking a turn at sleeping while we waited for Sonya to recover. To my surprise, he actually agreed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s smart. Once Sonya\u0027s able to talk, we\u0027ll need to move.\u0027 He smiled. \"Sydney\u0027s turning into a battle mastermind.\u0027\\n\\n \"Hey, she\u0027s not in charge here,\u0027 I teased. \"She\u0027s just a soldier.\u0027\\n\\n \"Right.\u0027 He lightly brushed his fingers against my cheek. \"Sorry, Captain.\u0027\\n\\n \"General,\u0027 I corrected, catching my breath at that brief touch.\\n\\n He gave Sonya a kind goodbye before disappearing into the house. She nodded, but I don\u0027t know if she really heard. Victor and Robert brought out two wooden kitchen chairs and set them in the shade. I chose a spot on the ground. Nobody spoke. It wasn\u0027t the weirdest thing I\u0027d ever experienced, but it was certainly strange.\\n\\n Sydney returned later with the groceries, and I briefly abandoned the group to check in with her. Victor\u0027s keys were lying back on the counter, which I took as a good sign. Sydney unloaded an assortment of food and handed me a box of a dozen donuts.\\n\\n \"Hope that\u0027s enough for you,\u0027 she remarked.\\n\\n I made a face at her presumption but took the donuts anyway. \"Come on outside when you\u0027re done,\u0027 I told her. \"It\u0027s like the barbecue of the damned. Except ... there\u0027s no grill.\u0027\\n\\n She looked puzzled, but when she joined us later, she seemed to get what I\u0027d been saying. Robert brought out a bowl of Cheerios, but neither Sydney nor Victor ate. I gave Sonya a donut, the first thing that took her attention from her yard. She held it in her hands, turning it over and over.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I can. I don\u0027t know if I can eat it.\u0027\\n\\n \"Of course you can.\u0027 I recalled how Dimitri had regarded food uncertainly too. \"It\u0027s chocolate-glazed. Good stuff.\u0027\\n\\n She took a tentative, rabbit-sized bite. She chewed it a billion times and finally swallowed. She closed her eyes briefly and sighed. \"Such sweetness.\u0027 Slowly, she continued taking more tiny bites. It took forever for her to get halfway through the donut, and at that point, she finally stopped. I\u0027d polished off three donuts by then, and my impatience to accomplish something was growing. Part of it was still the irritability from spirit, and part of it was just my continual restlessness to help Lissa.\\n\\n \"Sonya,\u0027 I said pleasantly, fully aware of how pissed off Dimitri was going to be at me defying his instructions. \"We wanted to talk to you about something.\u0027\\n\\n \"Mm-hmm,\u0027 she said, gazing at bees hovering around some honeysuckle.\\n\\n \"Is there a relative of yours ... someone who, uh, had a baby a while ago ... ?\u0027\\n\\n \"Sure,\u0027 she said. One of the bees flew from the honeysuckle to a rose, and she never looked away. \"Lots.\u0027\\n\\n \"Articulate, Rosemarie,\u0027 remarked Victor. \"Very articulate.\u0027\\n\\n I bit my lip, knowing an outburst would upset Sonya. And probably Robert too.\\n\\n \"This would be a secret baby,\u0027 I told her. \"And you were the beneficiary on a bank account that took care of the baby ... an account paid for by Eric Dragomir.\u0027\\n\\n Sonya\u0027s head whipped toward me, and there was no dreamy absentmindedness in her blue eyes now. A few seconds passed before she spoke. Her voice was cold and hard--not a Strigoi voice, but definitely a back off voice. \"No. I don\u0027t know anything about that.\u0027\\n\\n \"She\u0027s lying,\u0027 said Robert.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t need any powers to figure that out,\u0027 scoffed Sydney.\\n\\n I ignored both of them. \"Sonya, we know you know, and it\u0027s really important we find this baby ... er, child. Person.\u0027 We\u0027d made guesses on the age but weren\u0027t 100 percent sure. \"You said you were worried about Lissa earlier. This will help her. She needs to know. She needs to know she has another family member.\u0027\\n\\n Sonya turned her attention back to the bees, but I knew she was no longer watching them. \"I don\u0027t know anything.\u0027 There was a trembling in her voice, and something told me that maybe I shouldn\u0027t push this after all. I couldn\u0027t tell if she was afraid or on the verge of rage.\\n\\n \"Then why were you on the account?\u0027 This came from Victor.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know anything,\u0027 she repeated. Her voice could have made icicles form on the ornamental trees. \"Nothing.\u0027\\n\\n \"Stop lying,\u0027 snapped Victor. \"You know something, and you\u0027re going to tell us.\u0027\\n\\n \"Hey!\u0027 I exclaimed. \"Be quiet. You don\u0027t have interrogation rights here.\u0027\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t seem to be doing a very good job.\u0027\\n\\n \"Just shut up, okay?\u0027 I looked back at Sonya, replacing my glare with a smile. \"Please,\u0027 I begged. \"Lissa\u0027s in trouble. This will help her. I thought you said before that you wanted to help her?\u0027\\n\\n \"I promised ...\u0027 said Sonya. Her voice was so low, I could barely hear it.\\n\\n \"Promised what?\u0027 I asked. Patience, patience. I had to remain calm. I couldn\u0027t risk a breakdown.\\n\\n She squeezed her eyes shut and raked her hands through her hair violently, almost like a child about to have a tantrum. \"Promised not to tell. Promised not to tell anyone ...\u0027\\n\\n I had the urge to run over and shake her. Patience, patience, I repeated to myself. Don\u0027t upset her. \"We wouldn\u0027t ask you to break your promise if it wasn\u0027t important. Maybe ... maybe you can get in touch with this person ...\u0027 Who had she promised? Eric\u0027s mistress? \"And see if it\u0027s okay to tell us?\u0027 \"Oh for God\u0027s sake,\u0027 said Victor irritably. \"This is ridiculous and getting us nowhere.\u0027 He glanced at his brother. \"Robert?\u0027\\n\\n Robert hadn\u0027t done much so far today, but at Victor\u0027s command, Robert leaned forward. \"Sonya?\u0027\\n\\n Still obviously distraught, she turned to look at him ... and her face went still.\\n\\n \"Tell us what we need to know,\u0027 said Robert. His voice wasn\u0027t kind so much as smooth and lulling, with a faintly sinister touch. \"Tell us who and where this child is. Tell us who the mother is.\u0027\\n\\n This time, I did jump to my feet. Robert was using compulsion on her to get the answers. Sonya\u0027s eyes stayed locked on him, but her body began to shake. Her lips parted, though no sound came out. A tangle of thoughts swirled in my mind. Compulsion would get us what we needed to know, but something told me, it wasn\u0027t right--\\n\\n Sonya stopped me from any more pondering. She shot up almost as quickly as I had. She was still staring at Robert, but no longer in that transfixed, hypnotized way. She\u0027d broken the compulsion, and now ... now she was pissed. The features that had been scared and fragile earlier were filled with fury. I had no magical senses, but after being with Lissa, I knew raging spirit when I saw it. Sonya was a bomb, about to explode.\\n\\n \"How dare you ...\u0027 she hissed. \"How dare you try to compel me?\u0027\\n\\n Plants and vines near Robert suddenly sprang to life, growing to impossible heights. They reached out, tangled themselves around his chair\u0027s legs, and pulled. The chair toppled over, Robert along with it. Victor moved to help his brother, but Robert was already taking matters into his own hands. Recovering remarkably fast, he narrowed his eyes at Sonya, and she went flying backward, slamming against the wooden fence. Air users could do that trick sometimes, but this wasn\u0027t air blowing her back. This was spirit\u0027s telekinetic abilities. He apparently possessed them outside of dreams too. Lovely.\\n\\n I\u0027d seen spirit users battle it out before, when Avery Lazar and Lissa had gone one on one. That hadn\u0027t been pretty, particularly since more than this exterior psychic phenomena had occurred. Avery had actually dug into Lissa\u0027s mind--and mine. I didn\u0027t know Robert or Sonya\u0027s full skill set, but this couldn\u0027t end well.\\n\\n \"Dimitri!\u0027 I yelled, springing toward Sonya. I didn\u0027t exactly know what I was going to do, but tackling her seemed like a sound plan. From what I\u0027d observed, a lot of spirit involved eye contact with the target.\\n\\n And sure enough, when I managed to wrestle her to the ground, she struggled half- heartedly but mostly fought to keep her gaze on Robert. He screamed in sudden alarm, looking down at his own body in terror. Sonya was planting visions into his head. His expression hardened. He had to know it was an illusion, and a few moments later, he looked up, having broken her spell like she\u0027d broken his earlier compulsion.\\n\\n Dimitri came tearing out the door at that point, just as Robert used his mind to fling one of the chairs toward Sonya. Of course, I was on top of her, so the chair hit me in the back. Dimitri picked up pretty quickly what was going on and ran toward Robert, attempting the same tactic as me. Victor, possibly thinking his brother was in physical danger, tried to pry Dimitri away, which was futile. More vines began to reach toward Robert, and I realized constraining Sonya wasn\u0027t all that useful. \"Get him inside!\u0027 I yelled to Dimitri. \"Get him away from her!\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri had already guessed that and began dragging Robert toward the door. Even with Victor interfering, Dimitri\u0027s strength was enough to get Robert out of there and back into the house. As soon as her target was gone, all the energy seemed to fade out of Sonya. She made no more efforts to fight me and collapsed to the ground. I was relieved, having feared she\u0027d turn on me once Robert was gone. Tentatively, still on guard, I helped Sonya sit up. She leaned against me, weak as a rag doll, and cried into my shoulder. Another breakdown.\\n\\n After that, it was a matter of damage control. In order to keep the spirit users apart, Dimitri had taken Robert to the bedroom and left Victor with him. Robert seemed as worn out as Sonya, and Dimitri deemed the brothers safe enough to leave alone. Sonya collapsed on the couch, and after both Dimitri and I had tried to calm her down, we stepped away while Sydney held the Moroi woman\u0027s hand.\\n\\n I briefly recapped what had happened. Dimitri\u0027s face grew more and more incredulous as I did.\\n\\n \"I told you it wasn\u0027t time!\u0027 he exclaimed. \"What were you thinking? She\u0027s too weak!\u0027\\n\\n \"You call that weak? And hey, I was doing fine! It wasn\u0027t until Victor and Robert got involved that things went to hell.\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri took a step toward me, anger radiating off him. \"They should never have gotten involved. This is you, acting irrational again, jumping in foolishly with no thought of the consequences.\u0027\\n\\n Outrage shot through me in return. \"Hey, I was trying to make progress here. If being rational is sitting around and doing therapy, then I\u0027m happy to jump over the edge. I\u0027m not afraid to get in the game.\u0027\\n\\n \"You have no idea what you\u0027re saying,\u0027 he growled. We were standing closer now, hardly any space left between us as we engaged in our battle of wills. \"This may have set us back.\u0027\\n\\n \"This set us forward. We found out she knows about Eric Dragomir. The problem is she promised not to tell anyone about this baby.\u0027\\n\\n \"Yes, I promised,\u0027 piped up Sonya. Dimitri and I turned as one, realizing our argument was fully visible and audible to Sonya and Sydney. \"I promised.\u0027 Her voice was very small and weak, pleading with us.\\n\\n Sydney squeezed her hand. \"We know. It\u0027s okay. It\u0027s okay to keep promises. I understand.\u0027\\n\\n Sonya looked at her gratefully. \"Thank you. Thank you.\u0027\\n\\n \"But,\u0027 said Sydney carefully, \"I heard that you care about Lissa Dragomir.\u0027\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t,\u0027 interrupted Sonya, turning fearful again.\\n\\n \"I know, I know. But what if there was a way to help her without breaking your promise?\u0027\\n\\n Sonya stared at Sydney. Dimitri glanced at me questioningly. I shrugged and then stared at Sydney too. If someone had asked who could stage the best intervention with a crazy woman who\u0027d formerly been an undead monster, Sydney Sage would have been my last guess.\\n\\n Sonya frowned, all attention on Sydney. \"W-what do you mean?\u0027 \"Well ... what did you promise exactly? Not to tell anyone that Eric Dragomir had a mistress and baby?\u0027\\n\\n Sonya nodded.\\n\\n \"And not to tell who they were?\u0027\\n\\n Sonya nodded again.\\n\\n Sydney gave Sonya the warmest, friendliest smile I\u0027d ever seen on the Alchemist. \"Did you promise not to tell anyone where they are?\u0027 Sonya nodded, and Sydney\u0027s smile faltered a little. Then, her eyes lit up. \"Did you promise not to lead anyone to where they are?\u0027\\n\\n Sonya hesitated, no doubt turning every word over in her mind. Slowly, she shook her head. \"No.\u0027\\n\\n \"So ... you could lead us to them. But not tell us where they actually are. You wouldn\u0027t be breaking the promise that way.\u0027\\n\\n It was the most convoluted, ridiculous piece of logic I\u0027d heard in a while. It was something I would have come up with.\\n\\n \"Maybe ...\u0027 said Sonya, still uncertain.\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t break the promise,\u0027 Sydney repeated. \"And it would really, really help Lissa.\u0027\\n\\n I stepped forward. \"It would help Mikhail too.\u0027\\n\\n Sonya\u0027s mouth dropped open at the mention of her former lover. \"Mikhail? You know him?\u0027\\n\\n \"He\u0027s my friend. He\u0027s Lissa\u0027s friend too.\u0027 I almost said that if we found the missing Dragomir, we could then take Sonya to Mikhail. Recalling Dimitri\u0027s feelings of unworthiness, I decided to avoid that tactic just now. I didn\u0027t know how Sonya would react to a reunion with her beloved. \"And he wants to help Lissa. But he can\u0027t. None of us can. We don\u0027t have enough information.\u0027\\n\\n \"Mikhail ...\u0027 Sonya looked down at her hands again, small tears running down her cheeks.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t break your promise.\u0027 Sydney was so compelling she could have been a spirit user. \"Just lead us. It\u0027s what Mikhail and Lissa would want. It\u0027s the right thing to do.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t know which argument convinced Sonya the most. It could have been the part about Mikhail. Or it could have been the idea of doing \"the right thing.\u0027 Maybe, like Dimitri, Sonya wanted redemption for her Strigoi crimes and saw this as a chance.
