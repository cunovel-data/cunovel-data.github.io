Dimitri was still scary when dealing with Sonya, but after his breakdown with Donovan, he was careful not to fall into that berserk rage again. This was healthier for him in the long run but not so good for scaring up answers out of Sonya. It didn\u0027t help matters that we didn\u0027t exactly have a concrete question to ask her. We mostly had a series to throw at her. Did she know about another Dragomir? Was she related to the mother? Where were the mother and child? Things also went bad when Sonya realized we needed her too much to kill her, no matter how much silver stake torture we did.\\n\\n We\u0027d been at it for over an hour and were getting exhausted. At least, I was. I leaned against a wall near Sonya, and though I had my stake out and ready, I was relying on the wall a bit more than I liked to admit to keep me upright. None of us had spoken in a while. Even Sonya had given up on her snarling threats. She simply waited and stayed watchful, undoubtedly planning for escape, probably figuring we\u0027d tire before she did. That silence was scarier than all the threats in the world. I was used to Strigoi using words to intimidate me. I\u0027d never expected the power simply being quiet and staring menacingly could have.\\n\\n \"What happened to your head, Rose?\u0027 asked Dimitri, suddenly catching a glimpse of it.\\n\\n I\u0027d been tuning out a little and realized he was talking to me. \"Huh?\u0027 I brushed aside hair that had been obscuring part of my forehead. My fingers came away sticky with blood, triggering vague memories of crashing into the table. I shrugged, ignoring the dizziness I\u0027d been feeling. \"I\u0027m fine.\u0027\\n\\n Dimitri gave Sydney the quickest of glances. \"Go lay her down and clean it up. Don\u0027t let her sleep until we can figure out if it\u0027s a concussion.\u0027\\n\\n \"No, I can\u0027t,\u0027 I argued. \"I can\u0027t leave you alone with her ...\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\u0027 he said. \"Rest up so that you can help me later. You\u0027re no good to me if you\u0027re just going to fall over.\u0027\\n\\n I still protested, but when Sydney gently took my arm, my stumbling gave me away. She led me to the house\u0027s one bedroom, much to my dismay. There was something creepy about knowing I was in a Strigoi\u0027s bed--even if it was covered with a blue-and- white floral quilt.\\n\\n \"Man,\u0027 I said, lying back against the pillow once Sydney had cleaned my forehead. Despite my earlier denial, it felt great to rest. \"I can\u0027t get used to the weirdness of a Strigoi living in a place so ... normal. How are you holding up?\u0027\\n\\n \"Better than you guys,\u0027 said Sydney. She wrapped her arms around herself and eyed the room uncomfortably. \"Being around Strigoi is starting to make you guys seem not so bad.\u0027\\n\\n \"Well, at least some good\u0027s come out of this,\u0027 I remarked. Despite her joke, I knew she had to be terrified. I started to close my eyes and was jolted awake when Sydney poked my arm.\\n\\n \"No sleep,\u0027 she chastised. \"Stay up and talk to me.\u0027\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a concussion,\u0027 I muttered. \"But I suppose we can go over plans to get Sonya to talk.\u0027\\n\\n Sydney sat at the foot of the bed and grimaced. \"No offense? But I don\u0027t think she\u0027s going to crack.\u0027\\n\\n \"She will once she\u0027s gone a few days without blood.\u0027\\n\\n Sydney blanched. \"A few days?\u0027\\n\\n \"Well, whatever it takes to--\u0027 A spike of emotion flitted through the bond, and I froze. Sydney jumped up, her eyes darting around as though a group of Strigoi might have burst into the room.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 she exclaimed. \"I have to go to Lissa.\u0027\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not supposed to sleep--\u0027\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not sleeping,\u0027 I said bluntly. And with that, I jumped away from Sonya\u0027s bedroom and into Lissa\u0027s perspective.\\n\\n She was riding in a van with five other people whom I immediately recognized as other royal nominees. It was an eight-person van and also included a guardian driver with another in the passenger seat who was looking back at Lissa and her companions.\\n\\n \"Each of you will be dropped off in a separate location on the outskirts of a forest and given a map and compass. The ultimate goal is for you to reach the destination on the map and wait out the daylight until we come for you.\u0027\\n\\n Lissa and the other nominees exchanged glances and then, almost as one, peered out the van\u0027s windows. It was almost noon, and the sunlight was pouring down. \"Waiting out the daylight\u0027 was not going to be pleasant but didn\u0027t sound impossible. Idly, she scratched at a small bandage on her arm and quickly stopped herself. I read from her thoughts what it was: a tiny, barely noticeable dot tattooed into her skin. It was actually similar to Sydney\u0027s: blood and earth, mixed with compulsion. Compulsion might be taboo among Moroi, but this was a special situation. The spell in the tattoo prevented the candidates from revealing the monarch tests to others not involved with the process. This was the first test.\\n\\n \"What kind of terrain are you sending us to?\u0027 demanded Marcus Lazar. \"We\u0027re not all in the same physical shape. It\u0027s not fair when some of us have an advantage.\u0027 His eyes were on Lissa as he spoke.\\n\\n \"There is a lot of walking,\u0027 said the guardian, face serious. \"But it\u0027s nothing that any candidate--of any age--shouldn\u0027t be able to handle. And, to be honest, part of the requirements for a king or queen is a certain amount of stamina. Age brings wisdom, but a monarch needs to be healthy. Not an athlete by any means,\u0027 added the guardian quickly, seeing Marcus start to open his mouth. \"But it\u0027s no good for the Moroi to have a sickly monarch elected who dies within a year. Harsh, but true. And you also need to be able to endure uncomfortable situations. If you can\u0027t handle a day in the sun, you can\u0027t handle a Council meeting.\u0027 I think he intended that as a joke, but it was hard to tell since he didn\u0027t smile. \"It\u0027s not a race, though. Take your time getting to the end if you need it. Marked along the map are spots where certain items are hidden--items that\u0027ll make this more bearable, if you can decipher the clues.\u0027\\n\\n \"Can we use our magic?\u0027 asked Ariana Szelsky. She wasn\u0027t young either, but she looked tough and ready to accept a challenge of endurance.\\n\\n \"Yes, you can,\u0027 said the guardian solemnly.\\n\\n \"Are we in danger out there?\u0027 asked another candidate, Ronald Ozera. \"Aside from the sun?\u0027\\n\\n \"That,\u0027 said the guardian mysteriously, \"is something you\u0027ll need to learn for yourselves. But, if at any time you want out ...\u0027 He produced a bag of cell phones and distributed them. Maps and compasses followed. \"Call the programmed number, and we\u0027ll come for you.\u0027\\n\\n Nobody had to ask about the hidden message behind that. Calling the number would get you out of the long day of endurance. It would also mean you\u0027d failed the test and were out of the running for the throne. Lissa glanced at her phone, half-surprised there was even a signal. They\u0027d left Court about an hour ago and were well into the countryside. A line of trees made Lissa think they were nearing their destination.\\n\\n So. A test of physical endurance. It wasn\u0027t quite what she\u0027d expected. The trials a monarch went through had long been shrouded in mystery, gaining an almost mystical reputation. This one was pretty practical, and Lissa could understand the reasoning, even if Marcus didn\u0027t. It truly wasn\u0027t an athletic competition, and the guardian had a point in saying that the future monarch should possess a certain level of fitness. Glancing at the back of her map, which listed the clues, Lissa realized this would also test their reasoning skills. All very basic stuff--but essential to ruling a nation.\\n\\n The van dropped them off one by one at different starting points. With each departing candidate, Lissa\u0027s anxiety grew. There\u0027s nothing to worry about, she thought. I\u0027ve just got to sit through a sunny day. She was the next to last person dropped off, with only Ariana remaining behind. Ariana patted Lissa\u0027s arm as the van door opened.\\n\\n \"Good luck, dear.\u0027\\n\\n Lissa gave her a quick smile. These tests might all be a ruse on Lissa\u0027s part, but Ariana was the real deal, and Lissa prayed the older woman could get through this successfully.\\n\\n Left alone as the van drove away, unease spread through Lissa. The simple endurance test suddenly seemed much more daunting and difficult. She was on her own, something that didn\u0027t happen very often. I\u0027d been there for most of her life, and even when I\u0027d left, she\u0027d had friends around her. But now? It was just her, the map, and the cell phone. And the cell phone was her enemy.\\n\\n She walked to the edge of the forest and studied her map. A drawing of a large oak tree marked the beginning, with directions to go northwest. Scanning the trees, Lissa saw three maples, a fir, and--an oak. Heading toward it, she couldn\u0027t help a smile. If anyone else had botanical landmarks and didn\u0027t know their plants and trees, they could lose candidacy right there.\\n\\n The compass was a classic one. No digital GPS convenience here. Lissa had never used a compass like this, and the protective part of me wished I could jump in and help. I should have known better, though. Lissa was smart and easily figured it out. Heading northwest, she stepped into the woods. While there was no clear path, the forest\u0027s floor wasn\u0027t too covered with overgrowth or obstacles.\\n\\n The nice part about being in the forest was that the trees blocked out some of the sun. It still wasn\u0027t an ideal Moroi condition, but it beat being dropped in a desert. Birds sang, and the scenery was lush and green. Keeping an eye out for the next landmark, Lissa tried to relax and pretend she was simply on a pleasant hike.\\n\\n Yet ... it was difficult to do that with so much on her mind. Abe and our other friends were now in charge of working and asking questions about the murder. All of them were asleep right now--it was the middle of the Moroi night--but Lissa didn\u0027t know when she\u0027d return and couldn\u0027t help resenting this test for taking up her time. No, wasting her time. She\u0027d finally accepted the logic behind her friends\u0027 nomination--but she still didn\u0027t like it. She wanted to actively help them.\\n\\n Her churning thoughts almost led her right past her next landmark: a tree that had fallen ages ago. Moss covered it, and much of the wood was rotten. A star on the map marked it as a place with a clue. She flipped over the map and read: I grow and I shrink. I run and I crawl. Follow my voice, though I have none at all. I never do leave here, but I travel around-- I float through the sky and I creep through the ground. I keep my cache in a vault although I have no wealth, Seek out my decay to safeguard your health.\\n\\n Um.\\n\\n My mind went blank right about then, but Lissa\u0027s spun. She read it over and over again, examining the individual words and how each line played off the other. I never do leave here. That was the starting point, she decided. Something permanent. She looked around, considered the trees, then dismissed them. They could always be cut and removed. Careful not to stray too far from the fallen tree, she circled the area searching for more. Everything was theoretically transient. What stayed?\\n\\n Follow my voice. She came to a halt and closed her eyes, absorbing the sounds around her. Mostly birds. The occasional rustle of leaves. And--\\n\\n She opened her eyes and walked briskly to her right. The sound she\u0027d heard grew louder, bubbling and trickling. There. A small creek ran through the woods, hardly noticeable. Indeed, it seemed too tiny for the streambed carved out around it.\\n\\n \"But I bet you grow when it rains,\u0027 she murmured, uncaring that she was speaking to a stream. She looked back down at the clue, and I felt her clever mind rapidly piece it all together. The stream was permanent--but traveled. It changed size. It had a voice. It ran in deep parts, crawled when there were obstacles. And when it evaporated, it floated in the air. She frowned, still puzzling the riddle aloud. \"But you don\u0027t decay.\u0027\\n\\n Lissa studied the area once more, uneasily thinking decay could apply to any plant life. Her gaze moved past a large maple tree and then jerked back. At its base grew a clump of brown and white mushrooms, several wilting and turning black. She hurried over and knelt down, and that was when she saw it: a small hole dug into the earth nearby. Leaning closer, she saw a flash of color: a purple drawstring bag.\\n\\n Triumphantly, Lissa pulled it out and stood up. The bag was made of canvas and had long strings that would allow it to hang over her shoulder as she walked. She opened the bag and peered inside. There, tucked inside the fluffy and fuzzy lining, was the best thing of all: a bottle of water. Until now, Lissa hadn\u0027t realized how hot and dehydrated she\u0027d grown--or how wearying the sun was. The candidates had been told to wear sturdy shoes and practical clothing but hadn\u0027t been allowed any other supplies. Finding this bottle was priceless.\\n\\n Sitting on the log, she took a break, careful to conserve her water. While the map indicated a few more clues and \"rewards,\u0027 she knew she couldn\u0027t necessarily count on any more helpful bags. So, after several minutes\u0027 rest, she put away the water and slung the little tote over her shoulder. The map directed her due west, so that was the way she went.\\n\\n The heat beat on her as she continued her walk, forcing her to take a few more (conservative) water breaks. She kept reminding herself it wasn\u0027t a race and that she should take it easy. After a few more clues, she discovered the map wasn\u0027t quite to scale, so it wasn\u0027t always obvious how long each leg of the hike was. Nonetheless, she was delighted to successfully solve each clue, though the rewards became more and more baffling.\\n\\n One of them was a bunch of sticks sitting on a rock, something she would have sworn was a mistake, but someone civilized had clearly tied the bundle together. She added that into her bag, along with a neatly folded green plastic tarp. By now, sweat was pouring off her, and rolling up the sleeves of her button-down cotton shirt did little to help. She took more frequent breaks. Sunburn became a serious concern, so it was a huge relief when her next clue led to a bottle of sunscreen.\\n\\n After a couple hours of battling the intense summer heat, Lissa became so hot and tired that she no longer had the mental energy to be annoyed about missing out on whatever was happening at Court. All that mattered was getting to the end of this test. The map showed two more clues, which she took as a promising sign. She would reach the end soon and then could simply wait for someone to get her. A flash of realization hit her. The tarp. The tarp was a sun block, she decided. She could use it at the end.\\n\\n This cheered her up, as did the next prize: more water and a floppy, wide-brimmed hat that helped keep the sunlight from her face. Unfortunately, after that, what appeared to be a short leg of the trip turned out to be twice as long as she expected. By the time she finally reached the next clue, she was more interested in taking a water break than digging out whatever else the guardians had left her.\\n\\n My heart went out to her. I wished so, so badly that I could help. That was my job, to protect her. She shouldn\u0027t be alone. Or should she? Was that also part of the test? In a world where royals were almost always surrounded by guardians, this solitude had to be a total shock. Moroi were hardy and had excellent senses, but they weren\u0027t built for extreme heat and challenging terrain. I could have probably jogged the course easily. Admittedly, I wasn\u0027t sure I would have had Lissa\u0027s deductive skills in figuring out the clues.\\n\\n Lissa\u0027s last reward was flint and steel, not that she had any idea what they were. I recognized them instantly as the tools of a fire-making kit but couldn\u0027t for the world figure out why she\u0027d need to build a fire on a day like this. With a shrug, she added the items to her bag and kept going.\\n\\n And that\u0027s when things started to get cold. Really cold.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t entirely process it at first, mainly because the sun was still shining so brilliantly. Her brain said what she felt was impossible, but her goose bumps and chattering teeth said otherwise. She rolled her sleeves back down and quickened her pace, wishing that the sudden cold had at least come with cloud cover. Walking faster and exerting herself more helped heat her body.\\n\\n Until it began to rain.\\n\\n It started off as a mist, then changed to drizzle, and finally turned into a steady curtain of water. Her hair and clothing became soaked, making the cold temperature that much worse. Yet ... the sun still shone, its light an annoyance to her sensitive skin but offering no warmth in compensation.\\n\\n Magic, she realized. This weather is magical. It was part of the test. Somehow, Moroi air and water magic users had united to defy the hot, sunny weather. That was why she had a tarp--to block the sun and the rain. She considered getting it out now and wearing it like a cloak but quickly decided to wait until she reached the endpoint. She had no idea how far away that really was, though. Twenty feet? Twenty miles? The chill of the rain crept over her, seeping under her skin. It was miserable.\\n\\n The cell phone in the bag was her ticket out. It was barely late afternoon. She had a long time to wait before this test ended. All she had to do was make one call ... one call, and she\u0027d be out of this mess and back to working on what she should be at Court. No. A kernel of determination flared up within her. This challenge was no longer about the Moroi throne or Tatiana\u0027s murder. It was a test she would take on for herself. She\u0027d led a soft and sheltered life, letting others protect her. She would endure this on her own--and she would pass.\\n\\n This determination took her to the map\u0027s end, a clearing ringed in trees. Two of the trees were small and close enough together that Lissa thought she might be able to drape the tarp into some sort of reasonable shelter. With cold, fumbling fingers, she managed to get it out of the bag and unfold it to its full size--which was fortunately much larger than she\u0027d suspected. Her mood began to lift as she worked with the tarp and figured out how to create a small canopy. She crawled inside once it was complete, glad to be out of the falling rain.\\n\\n But that didn\u0027t change the fact that she was wet. Or that the ground was also wet-- and muddy. The tarp also didn\u0027t protect her against the cold. She felt a flash of bitterness, recalling the guardians saying magic was allowed in this test. She hadn\u0027t thought magic would be useful at the time, but now, she could certainly see the perks of being a water user to control the rain and keep it off her. Or, better yet: being a fire user. She wished Christian was with her. She would have welcomed the warmth of both his magic and his embrace. For this kind of situation, spirit seriously sucked--unless, perhaps, she got hypothermia and needed to try to heal herself (which never worked as well as it did on other people). No, she decided. There could be no question: water and fire users had the advantage in this test.\\n\\n That\u0027s when it hit her.\\n\\n Fire!\\n\\n Lissa straightened up from where she\u0027d been huddled. She hadn\u0027t recognized the iron and flint for what they were, but now, vague recollections of fire-making were coming back to her. She\u0027d never been taught those skills directly but was pretty sure striking the stones together would make a spark--if she only had dry wood. Everything out there was soaked... .\\n\\n Except for the bundle of sticks in her bag. Laughing out loud, she untied the sticks and set them in a place shielded from the rain. After arranging them in what seemed like a campfire-friendly pattern, she tried to figure out what to do with the steel and flint. In movies, she thought she\u0027d seen people just hit them to make sparks fly. So, that\u0027s what she did.\\n\\n Nothing happened.\\n\\n She tried three more times, and her earlier excitement gave way to spirit-darkened frustration. I pulled some of that from her, needing her to stay focused. On the fourth try, a spark flew off and faded away--but it was what she needed to understand the principle. Before long she could easily make sparks, but they did nothing when they landed on the wood. Up and down: her mood was a rollercoaster of hope and disappointment. Don\u0027t give up, I wanted to say as I drew off more negativity. Don\u0027t give up. I also wanted to give her a lesson on kindling, but that was pushing my limits.\\n\\n Watching her, I was beginning to realize how much I underestimated Lissa\u0027s intelligence. I knew she was brilliant, but I always imagined her being helpless in these situations. She wasn\u0027t. She could reason things out. That tiny spark couldn\u0027t penetrate the wood of the sticks. She needed a bigger flame. She needed something the sparks could ignite. But what? Surely nothing in this waterlogged forest.\\n\\n Her eyes fell on the map poking out of her bag. She hesitated only a moment before ripping and shredding the paper into a pile on top of the twigs. Supposedly, she\u0027d reached the end of the hike and didn\u0027t need the map. Supposedly. But it was too late now, and Lissa pushed forward with her plan. First, she pulled out some of the bag\u0027s fluffy lining, adding the bits of fuzz to the paper. Then she took up the flint and steel again.\\n\\n A spark jumped out and immediately caught a piece of the paper. It flared orange before fading out, leaving a wisp of smoke. She tried again, leaning forward to gently blow on the paper when the spark landed. A tiny flame appeared, caught a neighboring shred, and then faded. Steeling herself up, Lissa tried a final time.\\n\\n \"Come on, come on,\u0027 she muttered, as though she might compel a fire into existence.\\n\\n This time, the spark caught and held, turning into a small flame, then a larger flame that soon consumed her kindling. I prayed it would take to the wood, or else she was out of luck. Brighter and larger the flame grew, eating the last of the paper and fuzz ... and then spreading along the sticks. Lissa blew softly to keep it going, and before long, the campfire was in full blaze.\\n\\n The fire couldn\u0027t change the piercing cold, but as far as she was concerned, she had the warmth of the entire sun in her hands. She smiled, and a sense of pride that she hadn\u0027t felt in a while spread within her. Finally able to relax, she glanced out at the rainy forest and caught the faintest flashes of color in the distance. Channeling spirit, she used her magic to intensify her ability to see auras. Sure enough--hidden far, far out among the trees, she could see two auras filled with strong, steady colors. Their owners stood still, staying quiet and covered. Lissa\u0027s smile grew. Guardians. Or maybe the air and water users controlling the weather. None of the candidates were alone out here. Ronald Ozera had had no need to worry--but then, he wouldn\u0027t know that. Only she did. Maybe spirit wasn\u0027t so useless out here after all.\\n\\n The rain began to lighten, and the fire\u0027s warmth continued to soothe her. She couldn\u0027t read the time from the sky, but somehow, she knew she would have no problem waiting out the day and--\\n\\n \"Rose?\u0027 A voice summoned me out of Lissa\u0027s wilderness survival. \"Rose, wake up or ... whatever.\u0027\\n\\n I blinked, focusing on Sydney\u0027s face, which was a few inches from mine. \"What?\u0027 I demanded. \"Why are you bothering me?\u0027\\n\\n She flinched and jerked away, momentarily speechless. Pulling away Lissa\u0027s darkness while joined with her hadn\u0027t affected me at the time, but now, conscious in my own body, I felt anger and irritation flood me. It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s not Sydney, I told myself. It\u0027s spirit. Calm down. I took a deep breath, refusing to let spirit master me. I was stronger than it was. I hoped. As I fought to push those feelings down, I looked around and remembered I was in Sonya Karp\u0027s bedroom. All my problems came rushing back. There was a bound Strigoi in the other room, one we were barely keeping constrained and who didn\u0027t seem like she would give us answers anytime soon.\\n\\n I looked back at Sydney, who still seemed afraid of me. \"I\u0027m sorry ... I didn\u0027t mean to snap at you. I was just startled.\u0027 She hesitated a few moments and then nodded, accepting my apology. As the fear faded from her face, I could see that something else was bothering her. \"What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 I asked. As long as we were alive and Sonya was still trapped, things couldn\u0027t be that bad, right?\\n\\n Sydney stepped back and crossed her arms. \"Victor Dashkov and his brother are here.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-17.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \\n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
