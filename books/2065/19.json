{"id":110934,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"THE VANS PARKED IN A semi-remote part of Court, so seeing the area packed with eager Moroi was quite a shock to Lissa. Guardians moved through the people like ghosts, just as they had at the nomination session, keeping as much order as possible. The crowd kept getting in the way as the vans attempted to reach the garages, and faces looked in the windows, trying to get a glimpse of the royal candidates. Lissa stared at the masses in shock, almost afraid to get out. Ariana gave her a comforting smile. \"This is normal. They all want to know who made it and who didn\u0027t. They especially want to know.\u0027 She inclined her head toward the front of the van. Peering through the windshield, Lissa spied the other six candidates. Because the forest course could only accommodate so many people, the group had been split in half. The rest of the candidates would take the same test tomorrow and were no doubt curious who among their competitors had passed today. Lissa was used to order and decorum around royals, so she was astonished to see such eagerness and frenzy among them now. And of course, the \"common\u0027 Moroi who\u0027d been arriving at Court were mixed into the crowd too. Everyone was pushing, peering over the heads of others to find out what had happened. People were shouting some of the candidates\u0027 names, and I was half-surprised they hadn\u0027t come up with songs and banners. Lissa and her companions exited the van and were met with a wave of cheers that rippled through the crowd. It became obvious pretty quickly who had passed and who hadn\u0027t. This sent the crowd abuzz even more. Lissa stood rooted to the spot, staring around and feeling lost. It was one thing to rationally discuss the pros of her running for queen with her friends. It was an entirely different matter to suddenly be thrust into what the elections truly meant. Her focus had been limited to a few things: my safety, finding the murderer, and surviving the tests. Now, as she took in the crowd, she realized the election was bigger than her, bigger than anything she could have imagined. For these people, it wasn\u0027t a joke. It wasn\u0027t a scam to twist the law and stall for time. Their lives were figuratively on the line. Moroi and dhampirs lived inside various countries and obeyed those laws, but they also obeyed this government, the one that operated out of the Court. It reached around the world and affected every dhampir and Moroi who chose to stay in our society. We had some voting, yes, but the king or queen shaped our futures. The guardians in charge of the crowds finally gave the okay for family members to push through the masses and collect their nominees. Lissa had no one. Both Janine and Eddie--despite earlier claims--were occasionally given temporary tasks that prevented them from being with Lissa 24/7, and she certainly had no family to come for her. Adrift, she felt dizzy in the chaos, still stunned by her moment of clarity. Conflicting emotions warred within her. Deceiving everyone made her feel unworthy, like she should resign her candidacy right now. At the same time, she suddenly wanted to be worthy of the elections. She wanted to hold her head high and walk into the tests proudly, even if she was taking them for ulterior motives. A strong hand at last caught hold of her arm. Christian. \"Come on. Let\u0027s get out of here.\u0027 He pulled her away, shouldering through the onlookers. \"Hey,\u0027 he called to a couple guardians on the crowd\u0027s periphery. \"A little help here for the princess?\u0027 It was the first time I had ever seen him act like a royal, throwing around the authority of his bloodline. To me, he was snarky, cynical Christian. In Moroi society, at eighteen, he could now technically be addressed as Lord Ozera. I\u0027d forgotten that. The two guardians hadn\u0027t. They rushed to Lissa\u0027s side, helping Christian part the crowd. The faces around her were a blur, the noise a dull roar. Yet, every once in a while, something would come through to her. The chanting of her name. Declarations about the return of the dragon, which was the symbol of the Dragomir family. This is real, she kept thinking. This is real. The guardians efficiently led her out of it all and back across the Court\u0027s grounds to her building. They released her once they considered her safe, and she graciously thanked them for their help. When she and Christian were in her room, she sank onto the bed, stunned. \"Oh my God,\u0027 she said. \"That was insane.\u0027 Christian smiled. \"Which part? Your welcome home party? Or the test itself? You look like you just ... well, I\u0027m not really sure what you just did.\u0027 Lissa took a quick survey of herself. They\u0027d given her dry towels on the ride home, but her clothing was still damp and was wrinkling as it dried. Her shoes and jeans had mud all over them, and she didn\u0027t even want to think about what her hair looked like. \"Yeah, we--\u0027 The words stuck on her tongue--and not because she suddenly decided not to tell him. \"I can\u0027t say,\u0027 she murmured. \"It really worked. The spell won\u0027t let me.\u0027 \"What spell?\u0027 he asked. Lissa rolled up her sleeve and lifted the bandage to show him the tiny tattooed dot on her arm. \"It\u0027s a compulsion spell so I won\u0027t talk about the test. Like the Alchemists have.\u0027 \"Wow,\u0027 he said, truly impressed. \"I never actually thought those worked.\u0027 \"I guess so. It\u0027s really weird. I want to talk about it, but I just ... cant.\u0027 \"Its okay,\u0027 he said, brushing some of her damp hair aside. \"You passed. That\u0027s what matters. Just focus on that.\u0027 \"The only thing I want to focus on right now is a shower--which is kind of ironic, considering how soaked I am.\u0027 She didn\u0027t move, though, and instead stared off at the far wall. \"Hey,\u0027 said Christian gently. \"What\u0027s wrong? Did the crowd scare you?\u0027 She turned back to him. \"No, that\u0027s the thing. I mean, they were intimidating, yeah. But I just realized ... I don\u0027t know. I realized I\u0027m part of a major process, one that\u0027s gone on since--\u0027 \"The beginning of time?\u0027 teased Christian, quoting Nathan\u0027s nonsensical statement. \"Nearly,\u0027 she answered, with a small smile that soon faded. \"This goes beyond tradition, Christian. The elections are a core part of our society. Ingrained. We can talk about changing age laws or fighting or whatever, but this is ancient. And far-reaching. Those people out there? They\u0027re not all Americans. They\u0027ve come from other countries. I forget sometimes that even though the Court is here, it rules Moroi everywhere. What happens here affects the whole world.\u0027 \"Where are you going with this?\u0027 he asked. She was lost in her own thoughts and couldn\u0027t see Christian as objectively as I could. He knew Lissa. He understood her and loved her. The two of them had a synchronicity similar to what Dimitri and I shared. Sometimes, however, Lissa\u0027s thoughts spun in directions he couldn\u0027t guess. He\u0027d never admit it, but I knew part of why he loved her was that--unlike me, who everyone knew was impetuous--Lissa always seemed the picture of calmness and rationality. Then, she\u0027d do something totally unexpected. Those moments delighted him--but sometimes scared him because he never knew just how much a role spirit was playing in her actions. Now was one of those times. He knew the elections were stressing her, and like me, he knew that could bring out the worst. \"I\u0027m going to take these tests seriously,\u0027 she said. \"It\u0027s--it\u0027s shameful not to. An insult to our society. My ultimate goal is to find out who framed Rose, but in the meantime? I\u0027m going to go through the trials like someone who intends to be queen.\u0027 Christian hesitated before speaking, a rarity for him. \"Do you want to be queen?\u0027 That snapped Lissa from her dreamy philosophizing about tradition and honor. \"No! Of course not. I\u0027m eighteen. I can\u0027t even drink yet.\u0027 \"That\u0027s never stopped you from doing it,\u0027 he pointed out, becoming more like his usual self. \"I\u0027m serious! I want to go to college. I want Rose back. I don\u0027t want to rule the Moroi nation.\u0027 A sly look lit Christian\u0027s blue eyes. \"You know, Aunt Tasha makes jokes about how you\u0027d actually be a better queen than the others, except sometimes ... I don\u0027t think she\u0027s joking.\u0027 Lissa groaned and stretched back on the bed. \"I love her, but we\u0027ve got to keep her in check. If anyone could actually get that law changed, it would be her and her activist friends.\u0027 \"Well, don\u0027t worry. The thing about her \"activist friends\u0027 is that they have so much to protest, they don\u0027t usually get behind one thing at the same time.\u0027 Christian stretched out beside her and pulled her close. \"But for what it\u0027s worth, I think you\u0027d be a great queen too, Princess Dragomir.\u0027 \"You\u0027re going to get dirty,\u0027 she warned. \"Already am. Oh, you mean from your clothes?\u0027 He wrapped his arms around her, heedless of her damp and muddy state. \"I spent most of my childhood hiding in a dusty attic and own exactly one dress shirt. You really think I care about this T-shirt?\u0027 She laughed and then kissed him, letting her mind free itself of worry for a moment and just savor the feel of his lips. Considering they were on a bed, I wondered if it was time for me to go. After several seconds, she pulled back and sighed contentedly. \"You know, sometimes I think I love you.\u0027 \"Sometimes?\u0027 he asked in mock outrage. She ruffled his hair. \"All the time. But I\u0027ve got to keep you on your toes.\u0027 \"Consider me kept.\u0027 He brought his lips toward hers again but stopped when a knock sounded at the door. Lissa pulled back from the near-kiss, but neither of them broke from the embrace. \"Don\u0027t answer,\u0027 said Christian. Lissa frowned, peering toward the living room. She slipped out of his arms, stood up, and walked toward the door. When she was several feet from it, she nodded knowingly. \"It\u0027s Adrian.\u0027 \"More reason not to answer,\u0027 said Christian. Lissa ignored him and opened the door, and sure enough, my devil-may-care boyfriend stood there. From behind Lissa, I heard Christian say, \"Worst. Timing. Ever.\u0027 Adrian studied Lissa and then looked at Christian sprawling on the bed on the far side of the suite. \"Huh,\u0027 Adrian said, letting himself in. \"So that\u0027s how you\u0027re going to fix the family problem. Little Dragomirs. Good idea.\u0027 Christian sat up and strolled toward them. \"Yeah, that\u0027s exactly it. You\u0027re interrupting official Council business.\u0027 Adrian was dressed casually for him, jeans and a black T-shirt, though he made it look like designer clothing. Actually, it probably was. God, I missed him. I missed them all. \"What\u0027s going on?\u0027 asked Lissa. While Christian seemed to consider Adrian\u0027s arrival a personal offense, Lissa knew that Adrian wouldn\u0027t be here without a good reason-- especially this early in the Moroi day. Although he had on his normal lazy smile, there was an excited and eager glitter in his aura. He had news. \"I\u0027ve got him,\u0027 said Adrian. \"Got him trapped.\u0027 \"Who?\u0027 asked Lissa, startled. \"That idiot Blake Lazar.\u0027 \"What do you mean trapped?\u0027 asked Christian, as perplexed as Lissa. \"Did you set out a bear trap on the tennis courts or something?\u0027 \"I wish. He\u0027s over at the Burning Arrow. I just bought another round, so he should still be there if we hurry. He thinks I went out for a cigarette.\u0027 Judging from the scent wreathing Adrian, Lissa had a feeling he actually had been out for a cigarette. And likely shared in the round. \"You\u0027ve been at a bar this early?\u0027 Adrian shrugged. \"It\u0027s not early for humans.\u0027 \"But you\u0027re not--\u0027 \"Come on, cousin.\u0027 Adrian\u0027s aura didn\u0027t have the muted colors of someone who was completely drunk, but yes, he\u0027d definitely had a few drinks. \"If pretty boy Ambrose was right about Aunt Tatiana, then this guy can tell us the names of other jealous women.\u0027 \"Why didn\u0027t you ask him yourself?\u0027 asked Christian. \"Because me asking about my aunt\u0027s sex life would be sick and wrong,\u0027 said Adrian. \"Whereas Blake will be more than happy to talk to our charming princess here.\u0027 Lissa really wanted her bed, but finding out anything to help me sparked a new rush of energy within her. \"Okay, let me at least get some different clothes and brush my hair.\u0027 While she was changing in the bathroom, she heard Adrian say to Christian, \"You know, your shirt\u0027s kind of grungy-looking. Seems like you could put in a little more effort since you\u0027re dating a princess.\u0027 Fifteen minutes or so later, the threesome were on their way across Court to a tucked away bar inside an administrative building. I\u0027d been there before and had originally thought it was a weird place to house a bar. But, after a recent stint of filing, I\u0027d decided that if I were doing office work for living, I\u0027d probably want a quick source of alcohol on hand, too. The bar was dimly lit, both for mood and Moroi comfort. Adrian\u0027s joking aside, it really was early for Moroi, and only a couple patrons were there. Adrian made a small gesture to the bartender, which I presumed was some kind of ordering signal because the woman immediately turned and began pouring a drink. \"Hey, Ivashkov! Where\u0027d you go?\u0027 A voice called over to Lissa and the others, and after a few moments, she spotted a lone guy sitting at a corner table. As Adrian led them closer, Lissa saw that the guy was young--about Adrian\u0027s age, with curly black hair and brilliant teal eyes, kind of like Abe\u0027s recent tie. It was as though someone had taken the stunning color of both Adrian and Christian\u0027s eyes and mixed them together. He had a leanly muscled body--about as buff as any Moroi could manage--and, even with a boyfriend, Lissa could admire how hot he was. \"To get better-looking company,\u0027 replied Adrian, pulling out a chair. The Moroi then noticed Adrian\u0027s companions and jumped up. He caught hold of Lissa\u0027s hand, leaned over, and kissed it. \"Princess Dragomir. It\u0027s an honor to meet you at last. Seeing you from a distance was beautiful. Up close? Divine.\u0027 \"This,\u0027 said Adrian grandly, \"is Blake Lazar.\u0027 \"It\u0027s nice to meet you,\u0027 she said. Blake smiled radiantly. \"May I call you Vasilisa?\u0027 \"You can call me Lissa.\u0027 \"You can also,\u0027 added Christian, \"let go of her hand now.\u0027 Blake looked over at Christian, taking a few more moments to release Lissa\u0027s hand-- seeming very proud about those extra seconds. \"I\u0027ve seen you too. Ozera. Crispin, right?\u0027 \"Christian,\u0027 corrected Lissa. \"Right.\u0027 Blake pulled out a chair, still playing the over-the-top gentleman. \"Please. Join us.\u0027 He made no such offer to Christian, who went out of his way to sit close to Lissa. \"What would you like to drink? It\u0027s on me.\u0027 \"Nothing,\u0027 said Lissa. The bartender appeared just then, bringing Adrian\u0027s drink and another for Blake. \"Never too early. Ask Ivashkov. You drink as soon as you roll out of bed, right?\u0027 \"There\u0027s a bottle of scotch right on my nightstand,\u0027 said Adrian, still keeping his tone light. Lissa opened her eyes to his aura. It bore the bright gold all spirit users had, still muddled slightly from alcohol. It also had the faintest tinge of red--not true anger, but definite annoyance. Lissa recalled that neither Adrian nor Ambrose had had a good opinion of this Blake guy. \"So what brings you and Christopher here?\u0027 asked Blake. He finished a glass of something amber colored and set it down beside the new drink. \"Christian,\u0027 said Christian. \"We were talking about my aunt earlier,\u0027 said Adrian. Again, he managed to sound very conversational, but no matter how much he might want to clear my name, delving into the details of Tatiana\u0027s murder obviously bothered him. Blake\u0027s smile diminished a little. \"How depressing. For both of you.\u0027 That was directed to Adrian and Lissa. Christian might as well have not existed. \"Sorry about Hathaway too,\u0027 he added to Lissa alone. \"I\u0027ve heard how upset you\u0027ve been. Who\u0027d have seen that coming?\u0027 Lissa realized he was referring to how she\u0027d been pretending to be angry and hurt by me. \"Well,\u0027 she said bitterly. \"I guess you just don\u0027t know people. There were a million clues beforehand. I just didn\u0027t pay attention.\u0027 \"You must be upset too,\u0027 said Christian. \"We heard you and the queen were kind of close.\u0027 Blake\u0027s grin returned. \"Yeah ... we knew each other pretty well. I\u0027m going to miss her. She might have seemed cold to some people, but believe me, she knew how to have a good time.\u0027 Blake glanced at Adrian. \"You must have known that.\u0027 \"Not in the way you did.\u0027 Adrian paused to take a sip of his own drink. I think he needed it to restrain any snippy remarks, and honestly, I didn\u0027t begrudge him it. I actually admired his self-control. If I\u0027d been in his place, I would have long since punched Blake. \"Or Ambrose.\u0027 Blake\u0027s pretty smile transformed into a full-fledged scowl. \"Him? That blood whore? He didn\u0027t deserve to be in her presence. I can\u0027t even believe they let him stay at Court.\u0027 \"He actually thinks you killed the queen.\u0027 Lissa then added hastily, \"Which is ridiculous when all the evidence proves Rose did it.\u0027 Those hadn\u0027t been Ambrose\u0027s exact words, but she wanted to see if she could elicit a reaction. She did. \"He thinks what?\u0027 Yes. Definitely no smile now. Without it, Blake suddenly didn\u0027t seem as good-looking as earlier. \"That lying bastard! I have an alibi, and he knows it. He\u0027s just pissed off because she liked me better.\u0027 \"Then why\u0027d she keep him around?\u0027 asked Christian, face almost angelic. \"Weren\u0027t you enough?\u0027 Blake fixed him with a glare while finishing the new drink in nearly one gulp. Almost by magic, the bartender appeared with another. Blake nodded his thanks before continuing. \"Oh, I was more than enough. More than enough for a dozen women, but I didn\u0027t fool around on the side like he did.\u0027 Adrian\u0027s expression was growing increasingly pained at each mention of Tatiana\u0027s sex life. Still, he played his role. \"I suppose you\u0027re talking about Ambrose\u0027s other girl- friends? \" \"Yup. But \"girl\u0027 is kind of extreme. They were all older, and honestly, I think they paid him. Not that your mom needed to pay anyone,\u0027 added Blake. \"I mean, she\u0027s actually pretty hot. But you know, she couldn\u0027t really be with him in any real way.\u0027 It seemed to take all of them a moment to follow what Blake was alluding to. Adrian caught on first. \"What did you just say?\u0027 \"Oh.\u0027 Blake looked legitimately surprised, but it was hard to say if it was an act. \"I thought you knew. Your mom and Ambrose ... well, who could blame her? With your dad? Though just between you and me, I think she could have done better.\u0027 Blake\u0027s tone implied exactly whom he thought Daniella could have done better with. In Lissa\u0027s vision, Adrian\u0027s aura flared red. \"You son of a bitch!\u0027 Adrian was not the fighting type, but there was a first time for everything--and Blake had just crossed a serious line. \"My mom was not cheating on my dad. And even if she was ... she sure as hell wouldn\u0027t have to pay for it.\u0027 Blake didn\u0027t seem fazed, but maybe things would have been different if Adrian actually had hit him. Lissa rested her hand on Adrian\u0027s arm and squeezed it gently. \"Easy,\u0027 she murmured. I felt the smallest tingle of calming compulsion move from her into him. Adrian recognized it immediately and pulled his arm back, giving her a look that said he didn\u0027t appreciate her \"help.\u0027 \"I thought you didn\u0027t like your dad,\u0027 said Blake, utterly clueless that his news might be upsetting. \"And besides, don\u0027t get all pissy at me. I wasn\u0027t sleeping with her. I\u0027m just telling you what I heard. Like I said, if you want to start accusing random people, go after someone like Ambrose.\u0027 Lissa jumped in to keep Adrian from saying anything. \"How many women? Do you know who else he was involved with?\u0027 \"Three others.\u0027 Blake ticked off names on his hand. \"Marta Drozdov and Mirabel Conta. Wait. That\u0027s two. I was thinking with Daniella; that\u0027s three. But then, that\u0027s four with the queen. Yeah, four.\u0027 Lissa didn\u0027t concern herself with Blake\u0027s faulty math skills, though it did support Adrian\u0027s previous \"idiot\u0027 claims. Marta Drozdov was a semi-notorious royal who had taken to traveling the world in her old age. By Lissa\u0027s estimation, Marta was hardly in the U.S. most of the year, let alone Court. She didn\u0027t seem invested enough to murder Tatiana. As for Mirabel Conta ... she was notorious in a different way. She was known for sleeping with half the guys at Court, married or otherwise. Lissa didn\u0027t know her well, but Mirabel had never seemed overly interested in any one guy. \"Sleeping with other women wouldn\u0027t really give him a motive for killing the queen,\u0027 pointed out Lissa. \"No,\u0027 agreed Blake. \"Like I said, it\u0027s obvious that Hathaway girl did it.\u0027 He paused. \"Damned shame too. She\u0027s pretty hot. God, that body. Anyway, if Ambrose had killed her, he\u0027d have done it because he was jealous of me, because Tatiana liked me better. Not because of all those other women he was doing.\u0027 \"Why wouldn\u0027t Ambrose just kill you?\u0027 asked Christian. \"Makes more sense.\u0027 Blake didn\u0027t have a chance to respond because Adrian was still back on the earlier topic, his eyes flashing with anger. \"My mother wasn\u0027t sleeping with anybody. She doesn\u0027t even sleep with my father.\u0027 Blake continued in his oblivious way. \"Hey, I saw them. They were all over each other. Did I mention how hot your--\u0027 \"Stop it,\u0027 warned Lissa. \"It\u0027s not helping.\u0027 Adrian clenched his glass. \"None of this is helping!\u0027 Clearly, things weren\u0027t going the way he\u0027d hoped when he\u0027d first summoned Lissa and Christian from her room. \"And I\u0027m not going to sit and listen to this bullshit.\u0027 Adrian downed the drink and shot up from his chair, turning abruptly for the exit. He tossed some cash on the bar before walking out the door. \"Poor guy,\u0027 said Blake. He was back to his calm, arrogant self. \"He\u0027s been through a lot between his aunt, mom, and murdering girlfriend. That\u0027s why really, at the end of the day, you just can\u0027t trust women.\u0027 He winked at Lissa. \"Present company excluded, of course.\u0027 Lissa felt as disgusted as Adrian, and a quick glance at Christian\u0027s stormy face showed he felt the same. It was time to go before someone really did punch Blake. \"Well, it\u0027s been great talking to you, but we need to go.\u0027 Blake gave her puppy-dog eyes. \"But you just got here! I was hoping we could get to know each other.\u0027 It went without saying what he meant by that. \"Oh. And Kreskin too.\u0027 Christian didn\u0027t even bother with a correction this time. He simply took hold of Lissa\u0027s hand. \"We have to go.\u0027 \"Yeah,\u0027 agreed Lissa. Blake shrugged and waved for another drink. \"Well, any time you want to really experience the world, come find me.\u0027 Christian and Lissa headed for the door, with Christian muttering, \"I really hope that last part was meant for you, not me.\u0027 \"That\u0027s no world I want to experience,\u0027 said Lissa with a grimace. They stepped outside, and she glanced around, in case Adrian had lingered. Nope. He was gone, and she didn\u0027t blame him. \"I can see now why Ambrose and Adrian don\u0027t like him. He\u0027s such a ...\u0027 \"Asshole?\u0027 supplied Christian. They turned toward her building. \"I suppose so.\u0027 \"Enough to commit murder?\u0027 \"Honestly? No.\u0027 Lissa sighed. \"I kind of agree with Ambrose ... I don\u0027t think Blake\u0027s smart enough for murder. Or that the motive\u0027s really there. I can\u0027t tell if people are lying or not from their auras, but his didn\u0027t reveal anything overly dishonest. You joked, but if anyone was going to commit a jealous murder, why wouldn\u0027t the guys want to kill each other? A lot easier.\u0027 \"They did both have easy access to Tatiana,\u0027 Christian reminded her. \"I know. But if there is love and sex involved here ... it seems like it\u0027d be someone jealous of the queen. A woman.\u0027 A long, meaningful pause hung between them, neither of them wanting to say what they were both likely thinking. Finally, Christian broke the silence. \"Say, like, Daniella Ivashkov?\u0027 Lissa shook her head. \"I can\u0027t believe that. She doesn\u0027t seem like the type.\u0027 \"Murderers never seem like the type. That\u0027s why they get away with it.\u0027 \"Have you been studying up on your criminology or something? \" \"No.\u0027 They reached her building\u0027s front door, and he opened it for Lissa. \"Just laying out some facts. We know Adrian\u0027s mom never liked Tatiana for personality reasons. Now we find out that they were sharing the same guy.\u0027 \"She has an alibi,\u0027 said Lissa stonily. \"Everyone has an alibi,\u0027 he reminded her. \"And as we\u0027ve learned, those can be paid for. In fact, Daniella\u0027s already paid for one.\u0027 \"I still can\u0027t believe it. Not without more proof. Ambrose swore this was more political than personal.\u0027 \"Ambrose isn\u0027t off the list either.\u0027 They came to Lissa\u0027s room. \"This is harder than I thought it would be.\u0027 They went inside, and Christian wrapped his arms around her. \"I know. But we\u0027ll do it together. We\u0027ll figure it out. But ... we might want to keep some of this to ourselves. Maybe I\u0027m overreacting here, but I think it\u0027d be best if we don\u0027t ever, ever tell Adrian his mom has an excellent motive for having killed his aunt.\u0027 \"Oh, you think?\u0027 She rested her head against his chest and yawned. \"Naptime,\u0027 said Christian, leading her toward the bed. \"I still need a shower.\u0027 \"Sleep first. Shower later.\u0027 He pulled back the covers. \"I\u0027ll sleep with you.\u0027 \"Sleep or sleep?\u0027 she asked dryly, sliding gratefully into bed. \"Real sleep. You need it.\u0027 He crawled in beside her, spooning against her and resting his face on her shoulder. \"Of course, afterward, if you want to conduct any official Council business ...\u0027 \"I swear, if you say \"Little Dragomirs,\u0027 you can sleep in the hall.\u0027 I\u0027m sure there was a patented Christian retort coming, but another knock cut him off. He looked up in exasperation. \"Don\u0027t answer it. For real this time.\u0027 But Lissa couldn\u0027t help herself. She broke from his embrace and climbed out of bed. \"Its not Adrian ...\u0027 \"Then it\u0027s probably not important,\u0027 said Christian. \"We don\u0027t know that.\u0027She got up and opened the door, revealing--my mother. Janine Hathaway swept into the room as casually as Adrian had, her eyes sharp as she studied every detail around her for a threat. \"Sorry I was away,\u0027 she told Lissa. \"Eddie and I wanted to set up an alternating system, but we both got pulled for duty earlier.\u0027 She glanced over at the rumpled bed, with Christian in it, but being who she was, she came to a pragmatic conclusion, not a romantic one. \"Just in time. I figured you\u0027d want to sleep after the test. Don\u0027t worry--I\u0027ll keep watch and make sure nothing happens.\u0027 Christian and Lissa exchanged rueful looks. \"Thanks,\u0027 said Lissa.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-19.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
