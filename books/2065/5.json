{"id":110924,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"GETTING AWAY FROM DIMITRI WASN\u0027T just about our rocky romantic past. I\u0027d meant it when I said I didn\u0027t want him getting in trouble because of me. If the guardians found me, my fate wouldn\u0027t be that much different from what I\u0027d already been facing. But Dimitri? He\u0027d been making baby steps toward acceptance. Sure, that was pretty much destroyed now, but his chance for a life wasn\u0027t over. If he didn\u0027t want to live at Court or with humans, he could go back to Siberia and return to his family. Out there in the middle of nowhere, he\u0027d be hard to find. And with how close that community was, they\u0027d go to a lot of trouble to hide him if someone ever did try to hunt him down. Staying with me was definitely the wrong option. I just needed to convince him.\n \"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\u0027 Dimitri said, after we\u0027d been on the road for about an hour.\n We hadn\u0027t spoken much, both of us lost in our own thoughts. After a few more country roads, we\u0027d finally made it to an interstate and were making good time toward ... well, I had no idea. I\u0027d been staring out the window, pondering all the disasters around me and how I alone could fix them. \"Huh?\u0027 I glanced over at him.\n I thought there might be the smallest hint of a smile on his lips, which seemed absurd considering this was probably the worst situation he\u0027d been in since being restored from his Strigoi state.\n \"And it won\u0027t work,\u0027 he added. \"You\u0027re planning how to get away from me, probably when we eventually stop for gas. You\u0027re thinking maybe you\u0027ll have a chance to run off then.\u0027\n The crazy thing was, I had been thinking very much along those lines. The old Dimitri was a good partner on the road, but I wasn\u0027t so sure I liked having his old ability to guess my thoughts back as well.\n \"This is a waste of time,\u0027 I said, gesturing around the car.\n \"Oh? You have better things to do than flee the people who want to lock you up and execute you? Please don\u0027t tell me again that this is too dangerous for me.\u0027\n I glared. \"It\u0027s about more than just you. Running away shouldn\u0027t be my only concern. I should be helping clear my name, not hiding in whatever remote place you\u0027re undoubtedly taking me to. The answers are at Court.\u0027\n \"And you have lots of friends at Court who will be working on that. It\u0027ll be easier on them if they know you\u0027re safe.\u0027\n \"What I want to know is why no one told me about this--or, I mean, why Lissa didn\u0027t. Why\u0027d she hide it? Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d have been more helpful if I\u0027d been ready?\u0027\n \"We did the fighting, not you,\u0027 Dimitri said. \"We were afraid if you knew, you might give away that something was up.\u0027\n \"I would have never told!\u0027\n \"Not intentionally, no. But if you were tense or anxious ... well, your guards can pick up on those kinds of things.\u0027\n \"Well, now that we\u0027re out, can you tell me where we\u0027re going? Was I right? Is it some crazy, remote place?\u0027\n No answer.\n I narrowed my eyes at him. \"I hate not being in the loop.\u0027\n That tiny smile on his lips grew a little bigger. \"Well, I have my own personal theory that the more you don\u0027t know, the more your curiosity is likely to make sure you stick around with me.\u0027\n \"That\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 I replied, though really, it wasn\u0027t all that unreasonable of a theory. I sighed. \"When the hell did things get so out of control? When did you guys start being the masterminds? I\u0027m the one who comes up with the wacky, impossible plans. I\u0027m supposed to be the general here. Now I\u0027m barely a lieutenant.\u0027\n He started to say something else but then froze for a few seconds, his face instantly taking on that wary, lethal guardian look. He swore in Russian.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 I asked. His attitude was contagious, and I immediately forgot all thoughts of crazy plans.\n In the erratic flash of headlights from oncoming traffic, I could see his eyes dart up to the rearview mirror. \"We have a tail. I didn\u0027t think it would happen this soon.\u0027\n \"Are you sure?\u0027 It had grown dark, and the number of cars on the highway had increased. I didn\u0027t know how anyone could spot one suspicious car among that many, but well ... he was Dimitri. He swore again and suddenly, in a maneuver that made me grab the dashboard, he cut sharply across two lanes, barely missing a minivan that expressed its annoyance with a lot of honking. There was an exit right there, and he just barely made it without clipping the exit ramp\u0027s rail. I heard more honking, and when I looked back, I saw the headlights of a car that had made just as crazy a move to follow us onto the exit.\n \"The Court must have gotten the word out pretty fast,\u0027 he said. \"They had someone watching the interstates.\u0027\n \"Maybe we should have taken back roads.\u0027\n He shook his head. \"Too slow. None of it would have been an issue once we switched cars, but they found us too soon. We\u0027ll have to get a new one here. This is the biggest city we\u0027ll hit before the Maryland border.\u0027\n A sign said we were in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and as Dimitri skillfully drove us down a busy, commerce-filled road, I could see the tail mirroring everything we did. \"What exactly is your plan to get a new car?\u0027 I asked warily.\n \"Listen carefully,\u0027 he said, ignoring my question. \"It is very, very important that you do exactly as I say. No improvising. No arguing. There are guardians in that car, and by now, they\u0027ve alerted every other guardian around here--possibly even the human police.\u0027\n \"Wouldn\u0027t the police catching us create a few problems?\u0027\n \"The Alchemists would sort it out and make sure we ended up back with the Moroi.\u0027\n The Alchemists. I should have known they\u0027d get involved. They were a secret society of humans who helped protect Moroi and dhampir interests, keeping us out of the mainstream human public. Of course, the Alchemists didn\u0027t do it out of kindness. They thought we were evil and unnatural and mostly wanted to make sure we stayed on the fringes of their society. An escaped \"criminal\u0027 like me would certainly be a problem they would want to help the Moroi with.\n Dimitri\u0027s voice was hard and commanding when he spoke again, though his eyes weren\u0027t on me. They were busy scanning the sides of the road. \"No matter what you think of the choices everyone\u0027s been making for you, no matter how unhappy you are with this situation, you know--I know you do--that I\u0027ve never failed you when our lives were at stake. You trusted me in the past. Trust me now.\u0027\n I wanted to tell him that what he said wasn\u0027t entirely true. He had failed me. When he\u0027d been taken down by Strigoi, when he\u0027d shown that he wasn\u0027t perfect, he had failed me by shattering the impossible, godly image I had of him. But my life? No, he had always kept mine safe. Even as a Strigoi, I\u0027d never entirely been convinced he could kill me. The night the Academy had been attacked, when he\u0027d been turned, he\u0027d told me to obey him without question too. It had meant leaving him to fight Strigoi, but I\u0027d done it.\n \"Okay,\u0027 I said quietly. \"I\u0027ll do whatever you say. Just remember not to talk down to me. I\u0027m not your student anymore. I\u0027m your equal now.\u0027\n He glanced away from the side of the road just long enough to give me a surprised look. \"You\u0027ve always been my equal, Roza.\u0027\n The use of the affectionate Russian nickname made me too stupid to respond, but it didn\u0027t matter. Moments later, he was all business again. \"There. Do you see that movie theater sign?\u0027 I gazed down the road. There were so many restaurants and stores that their signs made a glittering haze in the night. At last, I saw what he meant. WESTLAND CINEMA.\n \"Yes.\u0027\n \"That\u0027s where we\u0027re going to meet.\u0027\n We were splitting up? I\u0027d wanted to part ways but not like this. In the face of danger, separating suddenly seemed like an awful idea. I\u0027d promised not to argue, though, and kept listening.\n \"If I\u0027m not there in a half hour, you call this number and go without me.\u0027 Dimitri handed me a small piece of paper from his duster pocket. It had a phone number scrawled on it, not one I recognized.\n If I\u0027m not there in a half hour. The words were so shocking that I couldn\u0027t help my protest this time. \"What do you mean if you\u0027re not--ah!\u0027\n Dimitri made another abrupt turn, one that caused him to run a red light and only narrowly miss a number of cars. More honking ensued, but the move had been too sudden for our tail to keep up. I saw our pursuers whiz past on the main road, brake lights flashing as they searched for a place to turn around.\n Dimitri had taken us into a mall parking lot. It was packed with cars, and I glanced at the clock to get a grasp for human time. Almost eight o\u0027clock at night. Early in the Moroi day, prime entertainment time for humans. He drove past a few entrances to the mall and finally selected one, pulling into a handicap spot. He was out of the car in one fluid motion, with me following just as quickly.\n \"Here\u0027s where we split up,\u0027 he said jogging toward a set of doors. \"Move fast, but don\u0027t run when we\u0027re inside. Don\u0027t attract attention. Blend in. Wind through it for a little bit; then get out through any exit but this one. Walk out near a group of humans and then head for the theater.\u0027 We stepped into the mall. \"Go!\u0027\n As though afraid I might not move, he gave me a small push toward an escalator while he took off on the main floor. There was a part of me that wanted to just freeze and stand there, that felt dumbfounded by the sudden onslaught of people, light, and activity. I soon pushed that startled part aside and began heading up the escalator. Fast reflexes and instinctual reactions were part of my training. I\u0027d honed them in school, in my travels, and with him.\n Everything I\u0027d been taught about eluding someone came rushing back to my head. What I wanted to do more than anything was look around and see if I had a follower, but that would have definitely attracted attention. I had to imagine that, at most, we had a couple minutes\u0027 lead on our pursuers. They would have had to turn around to get back to the mall and then circle to spot our car, presuming they figured out we\u0027d gone into the mall. I didn\u0027t think Harrisburg had enough of a Moroi presence to summon very many guardians on short notice. The ones they had would likely split up, some searching the mall and some guarding the entrances. This place had too many doors for the guardians to watch them all; my escape choice would be pure luck.\n I walked as fast as I reasonably could, weaving through couples, families with strollers, and giggling teens. I envied that last group. Their lives seemed so easy compared to mine. I also passed the usual mall stores, their names registering but not much more: Ann Taylor, Abercrombie, Forever 21 ... Ahead of me, I could see the center of the mall where several corridors branched out. I\u0027d have a choice to make soon.\n Passing an accessories store, I ducked inside and pretended to look at headbands. As I did, I covertly glanced back out to the mall\u0027s main section. I saw nothing obvious. No one had stopped; no one had followed me into the store. Beside the headbands section was a clearance bin filled with items that obviously deserved to be on clearance. One item was a \"girly\u0027 baseball cap, hot pink with a star done in rainbow rhinestones on the front. It was god-awful.\n I bought it, grateful the guardians hadn\u0027t taken away the meager cash I\u0027d had on me when arrested. They probably figured it wasn\u0027t enough to bribe anyone. I also bought a ponytail holder, all the while still keeping an eye on the store\u0027s doorway. Before leaving, I bound my hair up as much as I could with the holder and then put on the hat. There was something silly about being reduced to disguises, but my hair was an easy way to ID me. It was a deep, almost-black brown, and my lack of any recent haircut had it hanging to my mid-back. In fact, between that and Dimitri\u0027s height, we would have made a very conspicuous pair walking through here.\n I merged back into the shoppers and soon reached the mall\u0027s center. Not wanting to show any hesitation, I took a left toward Macy\u0027s. As I walked, I felt slightly embarrassed at the hat and wished I\u0027d at least had time to find a more stylish one. Minutes later, when I spotted a guardian, I was glad I\u0027d made such a quick fashion choice.\n He was near one of those carts you always see in the center of malls, pretending to be interested in cell phone covers. I recognized him first because of his stance and the way he was managing to act interested in a zebra print phone cover while simultaneously searching around him. Plus, dhampirs could always distinguish each other from humans with close enough examination. For the most part, our two races appeared pretty identical, but I could spot one of my own.\n I made sure not to look right at him and felt his eyes pass over me. I didn\u0027t know him, which meant he probably didn\u0027t know me either. He was likely going off a photo he\u0027d seen once and expected my hair to be a big giveaway. Keeping as casual an air as I could, I moved past him at a leisurely pace, glancing in windows that kept my back to him but sent no obvious messages that I was on the run. All the while, my heart pounded in my chest. Guardians could kill me on sight. Did that apply to the middle of a mall? I didn\u0027t want to find out.\n When I was clear of the cart, I picked up my pace a little. Macy\u0027s would have its own outside door, and now it was just a gamble to see whether or not I\u0027d made a good call coming in this direction. I entered the store, went down its escalator, and headed toward the main floor exit--passing a very nice selection of cute berets and fedoras. I paused near them, not because I planned on upgrading my hat, but because it allowed me to fall in step just behind a group of girls who were also exiting.\n We left the store together, and my eyes quickly adjusted to the change in light. There were lots of people around, but I again saw nothing threatening. My girls stopped to chat, giving me an opportunity to get my bearings without appearing totally lost. To my right, I spotted the busy road Dimitri and I had come in on, and from there, I knew how to get to the movie theater. I exhaled in relief and cut across the parking lot, still watching my surroundings. The farther I walked from the mall, the less crowded the parking lot became. Lampposts kept it from being totally dark, but there was still an eerie feel as things grew quieter and quieter. My initial impulse was to head right for the road and take the sidewalk directly to the theater. It was well lit and had people. But a moment later, I decided it was too conspicuous. I was pretty sure I could cut across parking lots much more quickly to get to the theater.\n It proved true--kind of. I had the theater in sight when I realized I had been followed after all. Not far ahead of me, the shadow of a parking lamp\u0027s post didn\u0027t cast correctly. The shadow was too broad. Someone was behind the pole. I doubted a guardian had coincidentally picked this spot in the hopes Dimitri or I would come by. Most likely it was a scout who\u0027d seen me and circled ahead for an ambush.\n I kept walking, trying not to obviously slow down, though every muscle in my body was tensing for attack. I had to be the one who attacked first. I had to be in control.\n My moment came, seconds before I suspected my ambusher would have made his move. I leapt out, throwing him--it turned out to be a dhampir I didn\u0027t recognize-- against a nearby car. Yup. I\u0027d surprised him. Of course, the surprise was mutual when the car\u0027s alarm went off, blaring into the night. I winced, trying to ignore the shrieking as I punched my captive on the left side of his jaw. I had to make the most of having him pinned.\n The force of my fist knocked his head against the car, but he took it admirably, promptly pushing back in an effort to free himself. He was stronger, and I did stumble a little, but not enough to lose my balance. What I lacked in strength, I made up for in speed. I dodged each attempt at me, but it brought me little satisfaction. That stupid car alarm was still going strong, and it was eventually going to attract the attention of other guardians or human authorities.\n I dashed around the side of the car, and he gave chase, stopping when we were on opposite sides. It was like two kids playing keep-away. We mirrored each other as he tried to anticipate which direction I\u0027d go. In the dim lighting, I saw something surprising tucked into his belt: a gun. My blood ran cold. Guardians were trained to use guns but rarely carried them. Stakes were our weapon of choice. We were in the business of killing Strigoi, after all, and guns were ineffective. But against me? Yeah. A gun simplified his job, but I had a feeling he\u0027d hesitate to use it. A car alarm could be blamed on someone accidentally getting too close, but a gunshot? That would elicit a call to the police. This guy wouldn\u0027t fire if he could help it--but he would if he ran out of options. This needed to end soon.\n At last I made a move toward the front of the car. He tried to intercept me, but then I surprised him by springing onto the car\u0027s hood (because honestly, at this point, it wasn\u0027t like the alarm could get any louder). In my split second of advantage, I threw myself off the car and onto him, knocking him flat to the ground. I landed on top of his stomach and held him down with all my weight while my hands went around his neck. He struggled, trying to throw me off, and nearly succeeded. At last, the lack of air won out. He stopped moving and fell into unconsciousness. I let go.\n For a brief moment, I had a flashback to our escape from Court, when I\u0027d used the same technique on Meredith. I saw her lying on the ground all over again and felt that same pang of guilt. Then, I shook it off. Meredith was okay. Meredith wasn\u0027t even here. None of that mattered. All that mattered was that this guy was out of commission, and I had to get out of here. Now.\n Without looking to see if others were coming, I tore off across the parking lot toward the theater. I stopped once I had some distance between me and the wailing car, using another car as cover. I saw no one near the guy yet, but over by the parking lot\u0027s front, close to the mall, there seemed to be some activity. I didn\u0027t stick around to get a closer look. Whatever it was, it couldn\u0027t be good for me.\n I reached the theater a couple minutes later, breathless more from fear than exhaustion. Running endurance was something I had built up a lot of, thanks to Dimitri. But where was Dimitri? Theatergoers mingled around, some giving my disheveled state an odd look, as they either waited for tickets or discussed what movie they\u0027d just seen. I saw no sign of Dimitri anywhere.\n I had no watch. How long had passed since we\u0027d parted? Surely not a half hour. I walked around the theater, staying obscured in the crowd, searching for any indication of Dimitri or more pursuers. Nothing. Minutes ticked by. Uneasily, I reached into my pocket and touched the piece of paper with the phone number. Leave, he\u0027d told me. Leave and call the number. Of course, I had no cell phone, but that was the least of my problems right now--\n \"Rose!\u0027\n A car pulled up at the curb where others were dropping people off. Dimitri was leaning out the driver\u0027s side window, and I nearly fell over in relief. Well, okay, not nearly. In reality, I didn\u0027t waste a moment in hurrying over to him and hopping into the passenger seat. Without a word, he hit the gas and got us away from the theater and back to the main road.\n We said nothing at first. He was so wound up and on edge, it seemed the slightest provocation would make him snap in half. He drove as fast as he could without attracting police attention, all the while glancing into the rearview mirror.\n \"Is there anyone behind us?\u0027 I asked at last, as he drove back onto the highway.\n \"It doesn\u0027t look like it. It\u0027ll take them a while to figure out what car we\u0027re in.\u0027\n I hadn\u0027t paid much attention when I\u0027d entered, but we were in a Honda Accord-- another ordinary-looking car. I also noticed that there was no key in the ignition.\n \"Did you hotwire this car?\u0027 I then rephrased my question. \"Did you steal this car?\u0027\n \"You have an interesting set of morals,\u0027 he observed. \"Breaking out of jail is okay. But steal a car, and you sound totally outraged.\u0027\n \"Im just more surprised than outraged,\u0027 I said, leaning back against the seat. I sighed. \"I was afraid ... well, for a moment there, I was afraid you weren\u0027t coming. That they\u0027d caught you or something.\u0027\n \"No. Most of my time was spent sneaking out and finding a suitable car.\u0027\n A few minutes of silence fell. \"You didn\u0027t ask what happened to me,\u0027 I pointed out, a little miffed.\n \"Don\u0027t need to. You\u0027re here. That\u0027s what counts.\u0027\n \"I got in a fight.\u0027\n \"I can tell. Your sleeve is ripped.\u0027\n I glanced down. Yup, ripped. I\u0027d also lost the hat in my mad dash. No big loss. \"Don\u0027t you want to know anything about the fight?\u0027 His eyes stayed on the road ahead of us. \"I already know. You took down your enemy. You did it fast, and you did it well. Because you\u0027re just that good.\u0027\n I pondered his words for a moment. They were matter-of-fact, all business ... and yet, his statement brought a tiny smile to my lips. \"Okay. So what now, General? Don\u0027t you think they\u0027ll scan reports of stolen cars and get our license plate number?\u0027\n \"Likely. But by then, we\u0027ll have a new car--one they won\u0027t have any clue about.\u0027\n I frowned. \"How are you pulling that off?\u0027\n \"We\u0027re meeting someone in a few hours.\u0027\n \"Damn it. I really hate being the last one to know about everything.\u0027\n \"A few hours\u0027 put us in Roanoke, Virginia. Most of our drive had passed uneventfully up until that point. But as the city came into view, I noticed Dimitri watching the exit signs until he found the one he wanted. Turning off the interstate, he continued checking for a tail and found none. We reached another commerce-filled road, and he drove to a McDonald\u0027s that stood out clearly from the rest of the businesses.\n \"I don\u0027t suppose,\u0027 I said, \"that this is a food break?\u0027\n \"This,\u0027 he responded, \"is where we catch our next ride.\u0027\n He drove around the restaurant\u0027s parking lot, his eyes scanning for something, though I didn\u0027t initially know what. I spotted it a fraction of a second before he did. In the far corner of the lot, I saw a woman leaning against a tan SUV, her back to us. I couldn\u0027t see much of her except that she wore a dark shirt and had tousled blond hair that almost touched her shoulders.\n Dimitri pulled into the spot next to her vehicle, and I was out of ours the second he hit the brake. I recognized her before she even turned around.\n \"Sydney?\u0027 The name came out as a question, though I knew for sure it was her.\n Her head turned, and I saw a familiar face--a human face--with brown eyes that could turn amber in the sun and a faint gold tattoo on her cheek.\n \"Hey, Rose,\u0027 she said, a rueful smile playing on her lips. She held up a McDonald\u0027s bag. \"Figured you\u0027d be hungry.\u0027\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-5.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
