{"id":110927,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND IS A dream-walker, you pick up a few lessons. One of the most important is that doing physical things in dreams feels exactly like doing them in the real world. Say, like kissing someone. Adrian and I had shared a number of dream- kisses intense enough to spark my body wanting to try a whole lot more. Although I\u0027d never actually attacked someone in a dream, I was willing to bet a punch here would feel just as painful as a real one. Without hesitation, I lunged toward Victor, uncertain as to whether I should sock him or choke him. Both seemed like good ideas. Turned out, I did neither. Before I could reach him, I slammed into an invisible wall--hard. It both blocked me from him and bounced me back at the impact. I stumbled, tried to regain my footing, but instead landed painfully on the ground. Yup--dreams felt just like real life. I glared at Robert, feeling a mix of both anger and uneasiness. I tried to hide that last emotion. \"You\u0027re a spirit user with telekinesis?\u0027 We\u0027d known that was possible, but it was a skill neither Lissa nor Adrian had mastered yet. I really didn\u0027t like the idea that Robert might have the power to throw objects around and create invisible barriers. It was a disadvantage we didn\u0027t need. Robert remained enigmatic. \"I control the dream.\u0027 Victor was looking down at me with that smug, calculating expression he excelled at. Realizing what an undignified position I was in, I leapt to my feet. I kept a hard stance, my body tense and ready as I wondered if Robert would keep the wall up continuously. \"Are you done with your tantrum?\u0027 asked Victor. \"Behaving like a civilized person will make our talk so much more pleasant.\u0027 \"I have no interest in talking to you,\u0027 I snapped. \"The only thing I\u0027m going to do is hunt you down in the real world and drag you back to the authorities.\u0027 \"Charming,\u0027 said Victor. \"We can share a cell.\u0027 I winced. \"Yes,\u0027 he continued. \"I know all about what happened. Poor Tatiana. Such a tragedy. Such a loss.\u0027 His mocking, melodramatic tone sparked an alarming idea. \"You ... you didn\u0027t have anything to do with it, did you?\u0027 Victor\u0027s escape from prison had triggered a lot of fear and paranoia amongst the Moroi. They\u0027d been convinced he was coming for them all. Knowing the truth about the escape, I\u0027d dismissed such talk and figured he\u0027d simply lie low. Now, remembering how he\u0027d once wanted to start a revolution among the Moroi, I wondered if the queen\u0027s murderer actually was the most evil villain we knew. Victor snorted. \"Hardly.\u0027 He put his hands behind his back as he paced the room and pretended to study the art. I again wondered how far Robert\u0027s shield extended. \"I have much more sophisticated methods to accomplish my goals. I wouldn\u0027t stoop to something like that--and neither would you.\u0027 I was about to point out that messing with Lissa\u0027s mind was hardly sophisticated, but his last words caught my attention. \"You don\u0027t think I did it?\u0027 He glanced back from where he\u0027d been studying a man with a top hat and cane. \"Of course not. You\u0027d never do anything that required that much foresight. And, if what I\u0027ve heard about the crime scene is true, you\u0027d never leave that much evidence behind.\u0027 There was both an insult and a compliment there. \"Well, thanks for the vote of confidence. I\u0027ve been worrying about what you\u0027d think.\u0027 This earned me a smile, and I crossed my arms over my chest. \"How do you guys even know what\u0027s happening at Court? Do you have spies?\u0027 \"This sort of thing spreads throughout the Moroi world quickly,\u0027 said Victor. \"I\u0027m not that out of touch. I knew about her murder almost as soon as it happened. And about your most impressive escape.\u0027 My attention mostly stayed on Victor, but I did cast a quick glance at Robert. He remained silent, and from the blank, distracted look in his eyes, I wondered if he was even aware of what was being said around him. Seeing him always sent a chill down my spine. He was a prominent example of spirit at its worst. \"Why do you care?\u0027 I demanded. \"And why the hell are you bothering me in my dreams?\u0027 Victor continued his pacing, pausing to run his fingertips along the harp\u0027s smooth, wooden surface. \"Because I have a great interest in Moroi politics. And I\u0027d like to know who\u0027s responsible for the murder and what their game is.\u0027 I smirked. \"Sounds like you\u0027re just jealous someone else is pulling the strings besides you for a change. No pun intended.\u0027 His hand dropped from the harp, back to his side, and he fixed his sharp eyes on me, eyes the same pale green as Lissa\u0027s. \"Your witty commentary isn\u0027t going to get you anywhere. You can either let us help you or not.\u0027 \"You are the last person I want help from. I don\u0027t need it.\u0027 \"Yes. Things seem to be going quite well for you, now that you\u0027re a hunted fugitive and on the run with a man that many still believe is Strigoi.\u0027 Victor gave a calculated pause. \"Of course, I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t mind that last part so much. You know, if I found you two, I could probably shoot you and be welcomed back as a hero.\u0027 \"Don\u0027t bet on it.\u0027 Rage burned through me, both at his insinuation and because he\u0027d caused so much trouble for Dimitri and me in the past. With great force of will, I replied in a low, deadly voice: \"I am going to find you. And you probably won\u0027t live to see the authorities.\u0027 \"We already established murder isn\u0027t in your skill set.\u0027 Victor sat down in one of the cushioned chairs, making himself comfortable. Robert continued standing, that out-of-it expression still on his face. \"Now, the first thing we need to do is determine why someone would want to kill our late queen. Her abrasive personality is hardly motivation, though I\u0027m sure it didn\u0027t hurt. People do things like this for power and advantage, to push their agendas through. From what I hear, Tatiana\u0027s most controversial action recently was that age law--yes, that\u0027s the one. The one making you scowl at me like that. It stands to reason that her murderer opposed that.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to comply with Victor at all. I didn\u0027t want a reasonable discussion with him. What I wanted was some indication of where he was in real life, and then, I wanted to take a chance on slamming into that invisible wall again. It\u0027d be worth the risk if I could do some damage. So, I was a bit surprised when I found myself saying, \"Or, whoever did it wanted to push something worse through--something harsher on dhampirs. They thought her decree was too soft.\u0027 I admit, catching Victor Dashkov off guard was one of the greatest joys of my life. I had that satisfaction now, seeing his eyebrows rise in astonishment. It wasn\u0027t easy proposing something a master schemer like him hadn\u0027t already considered. \"Interesting,\u0027 he said at last. \"I may have underestimated you, Rose. That\u0027s a brilliant deduction on your part.\u0027 \"Well, um ... it wasn\u0027t exactly my deduction.\u0027 Victor waited expectantly. Even Robert snapped out of his daze and focused on me. It was creepy. \"It was Tatiana\u0027s. I mean, not her deduction. She said it directly--well, that is, the note she left for me did.\u0027 Why was I rambling in front of these guys? At least I surprised Victor again. \"Tatiana Ivashkov left you a note with clandestine information? Whatever for?\u0027 I bit my lip and turned my attention over to one of the paintings. It showed an elegant Moroi woman with those same jade green eyes most Dashkovs and Dragomirs shared. I suddenly wondered if perhaps Robert had formed this dream in some Dashkov mansion from their childhood. Movement in my periphery made me instantly turn back to the brothers. Victor rose and took a few steps toward me, curiosity and cunning all over him. \"There\u0027s more. What else did she tell you? She knew she was in danger. She knew this law was part of it ... but it wasn\u0027t the only thing, was it?\u0027 I remained silent, but a crazy idea began forming in my mind. I was actually considering seeing if Victor could help me. Of course, in retrospect, that wasn\u0027t such a crazy notion, considering I\u0027d already busted him out of prison to get his help. \"Tatiana said ...\u0027 Should I say it? Should I give up the secret even Lissa didn\u0027t know? If Victor knew there was another Dragomir, he might use that knowledge for one of his schemes. How? I wasn\u0027t sure but had long learned to expect the unexpected from him. Yet ... Victor knew a lot of Moroi secrets. I would have enjoyed watching him and Abe match wits. And I didn\u0027t doubt that a lot of Victor\u0027s inside knowledge involved the Dragomirs and Dashkovs. I swallowed. \"Tatiana said that there was another Dragomir. That Lissa\u0027s dad had an affair and that if I could find whoever this is, it\u0027ll give Lissa her power back on the Council.\u0027 When Victor and Robert exchanged shocked looks, I knew my plan had backfired. Victor wasn\u0027t going to give me insight. Instead, I\u0027d been the one to just yield valuable information. Damn, damn, damn. He turned his attention back to me, his expression speculative. \"So. Eric Dragomir wasn\u0027t the saint he so often played.\u0027 I balled my fists. \"Don\u0027t slam her dad.\u0027 \"Wouldn\u0027t dream of it. I liked Eric immensely. But yes ... if this is true, then Tatiana is right. Vasilisa technically has family backing, and her liberal views would certainly cause friction on a Council that never seems to change their ways.\u0027 He chuckled. \"Yes, I can definitely see that upsetting many people--including a murderer who wants to oppress dhampirs. I imagine he or she wouldn\u0027t want this knowledge to get out.\u0027 \"Someone already tried to get rid of records linking Lissa\u0027s dad to a mistress.\u0027 I again spoke without thinking and hated myself for it. I didn\u0027t want to give the brothers any more info. I didn\u0027t want to play like we were all working together here. \"And let me guess,\u0027 said Victor. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re trying to do, isn\u0027t it? Find this Dragomir bastard.\u0027 \"Hey, don\u0027t--\u0027 \"It\u0027s just an expression,\u0027 he interrupted. \"If I know you two--and I feel confident I do-- Vasilisa is desperately trying to clear your name back at Court while you and Belikov are off on a sexually charged adventure to find her brother or sister.\u0027 \"You don\u0027t know anything about us,\u0027 I growled. Sexually charged indeed. He shrugged. \"Your face says it all. And really, it\u0027s not a bad idea. Not a great one either, but not bad. Give the Dragomir family a quorum, and you\u0027ll have a voice speaking on your behalf on the Council. I don\u0027t suppose you have any leads?\u0027 \"We\u0027re working on it,\u0027 I replied evasively. Victor looked at Robert. I knew the two didn\u0027t have any psychic communication, but as they exchanged glances, I had a feeling they were both thinking the same thing and confirming with each other. At last, Victor nodded and turned back to me. \"Very well then. We\u0027ll help you.\u0027 He made it sound like he was reluctantly agreeing to do me a big favor. \"We don\u0027t need your help!\u0027 \"Of course you do. You\u0027re out of your league, Rose. You\u0027re wandering into a nest of ugly, complex politics--something you have no experience with. There\u0027s no shame in acknowledging that, just as I\u0027m not ashamed to admit that in an irrational, ill-planned fist fight, you would certainly prove superior.\u0027 Another backhanded compliment. \"We\u0027re doing just fine. We have an Alchemist helping us.\u0027 There. That would show him who was out of whose league. And, to my credit, he did look slightly impressed. Slightly. \"Better than I expected. Has your Alchemist come up with a location or any lead yet?\u0027 \"She\u0027s working on it,\u0027 I repeated. He sighed in frustration. \"We\u0027re going to need time then, aren\u0027t we? Both for Vasilisa to investigate Court and you to start tracking this child.\u0027 \"You\u0027re the one who acts like you know everything,\u0027 I pointed out. \"I figured you\u0027d know something about this.\u0027 \"To my chagrin, no.\u0027 Victor didn\u0027t really sound all that put out. \"But as soon as we get a thread, I assure you, I\u0027ll be essential in unraveling it.\u0027 He walked over to his brother and patted Robert\u0027s arm comfortingly. Robert stared back adoringly. \"We\u0027ll visit you again. Let us know when you have something useful, and then we\u0027ll meet up with you.\u0027 My eyes widened. \"You\u0027ll do no such--\u0027 I hesitated. I\u0027d let Victor escape in Las Vegas. Now he was offering to come to me. Maybe I could repair that mistake and make good on my earlier threat to him. Quickly, I tried to cover my lapse of speech. \"How do I know I can trust you?\u0027 \"You can\u0027t,\u0027 he said bluntly. \"You\u0027ve got to take it on faith that the enemy of your enemy is your friend.\u0027 \"I\u0027ve always hated that saying. You\u0027ll always be my enemy.\u0027 I was a bit surprised when Robert suddenly came to life. He glared and stepped forward. \"My brother is a good man, shadow-girl! If you hurt him ... if you hurt him, you\u0027ll pay. And next time you won\u0027t come back. The world of the dead won\u0027t give you up a second time.\u0027 I knew better than to take the threats of a crazy man seriously, but his last words sent a chill through me. \"Your brother is a psycho--\u0027 \"Enough, enough.\u0027 Victor again gave Robert a reassuring pat on the arm. Still scowling at me, the younger Dashkov brother backed off, but I was willing to bet that invisible wall was back in place. \"This does us no good. We\u0027re wasting time--which is something we don\u0027t have enough of. We need more. The monarch elections will start any day now, and Tatiana\u0027s murderer could have a hand in those if there really was some agenda going on. We need to slow down the elections--not just to thwart the assassin, but also to give all of us time to accomplish our tasks.\u0027 I was getting tired of all this. \"Yeah? And how do you propose we do that?\u0027 Victor smiled. \"By running Vasilisa as a candidate for queen.\u0027 Seeing as this was Victor Dashkov we were dealing with, I really shouldn\u0027t have been surprised by anything he said. It was a testament to his level of craziness that he continually caught me unprepared. \"That,\u0027 I declared, \"is impossible.\u0027 \"Not really,\u0027 he replied. I threw my hands up in exasperation. \"Haven\u0027t you been paying attention to what we\u0027ve been talking about? The whole point is to get Lissa full family rights with the Moroi. She can\u0027t even vote! How could she run for queen?\u0027 \"Actually, the law says she can. According to the way the nomination policy is written, one person from each royal line may run for the monarch position. That\u0027s all it says. One person from each line may run. There is no mention of how many people need to be in her family, as there is for her to vote on the Council. She simply needs three nominations--and the law doesn\u0027t specify which family they come from.\u0027 Victor spoke in such a precise, crisp way that he might as well have been reciting from a legal book. I wondered if he had all the laws memorized. I supposed if you were going to make a career of breaking laws, you might as well know them. \"Whoever wrote that law probably assumed the candidates would have family members. They just didn\u0027t bother spelling it out. That\u0027s what people will say if Lissa runs. They\u0027ll fight it.\u0027 \"They can fight it all they want. Those who are denying her a Council spot base it on one line in the law books that mentions another family member. If that\u0027s their argument, that every detail must count, then they\u0027ll have to do the same for the election laws-- which, as I have said, do not mention family backing. That\u0027s the beauty of this loophole. Her opponents can\u0027t have it both ways.\u0027 A smile twisted at Victor\u0027s lips, supremely confident. \"I assure you, there is absolutely nothing in the wording that prevents her from doing this.\u0027 \"How about her age?\u0027 I pointed out. \"The princes and princesses who run are always old.\u0027 The title of prince or princess went to a family\u0027s oldest member, and traditionally, that was the person who ran for king or queen. The family could decide to nominate someone else more fitting, but even then--to my knowledge--it was always someone older and experienced. \"The only age restriction is full adulthood,\u0027 said Victor. \"She\u0027s eighteen. She qualifies. The other families have much larger pools to draw from, so naturally, they\u0027d select someone who seemed more experienced. In the Dragomir case? Well, that\u0027s not an option, now is it? Besides, young monarchs aren\u0027t without precedence. There was a very famous queen--Alexandra--who wasn\u0027t much older than Vasilisa. Very well loved, very extraordinary. Her statue is by the Court\u0027s church.\u0027 I shifted uncomfortably. \"Actually ... it\u0027s, um, not there anymore. It kind of blew up.\u0027 Victor just stared. He\u0027d apparently heard about my escape but not all of the details. \"It\u0027s not important,\u0027 I said hastily, feeling guilty that I\u0027d been indirectly responsible for blowing up a renowned queen. \"This whole idea about using Lissa is ridiculous.\u0027 \"You won\u0027t be the only one who thinks so,\u0027 Victor said. \"They\u0027ll argue. They\u0027ll fight. In the end, the law will prevail. They\u0027ll have to let her run. She\u0027ll go through the tests and probably pass. Then, when voting comes, the laws that govern those procedures reference a family member assisting with the vote.\u0027 My head was spinning by now. I felt mentally exhausted listening to all these legal loopholes and technicalities. \"Just come right out and put it in simple language,\u0027 I ordered. \"When voting comes, she won\u0027t be eligible. She has no family to fulfill the role required at the actual election. In other words, the law says she can run and take the tests. Yet, people can\u0027t actually vote for her because she has no family.\u0027 \"That\u0027s ... idiotic.\u0027 \"Agreed.\u0027 He paused. I don\u0027t think either of us ever expected to concur on something. \"Lissa would hate this. She would never, ever want to be queen.\u0027 \"Are you not following this?\u0027 exclaimed Victor. \"She won\u0027t be queen. She can\u0027t. It\u0027s a badly written law for a situation no one foresaw. It\u0027s a mess. And it will bog down the elections so badly that we\u0027ll have extra time to find Vasilisa\u0027s sibling and find out who really killed Tatiana.\u0027 \"Hey! I told you: There\u0027s no \"we\u0027 here. I\u0027m not going to--\u0027 Victor and Robert exchanged looks. \"Get Vasilisa nominated,\u0027 said Victor abruptly. \"We\u0027ll be in touch soon on where to meet you for the Dragomir search.\u0027 IT \"Thats not--\u0027 I woke up. My immediate reaction was to swear, but then, remembering where I was, I kept my expletives inside my own head. I could make out Dimitri\u0027s silhouette in the corner, alert and watchful, and didn\u0027t want him to know I was awake. Closing my eyes, I shifted into a more comfortable position, hoping for true sleep that would block out the Dashkov brothers and their ridiculous schemes. Lissa running for queen? It was crazy. And yet ... it really wasn\u0027t much crazier than most of the things I did. Putting that aside, I let my body relax and felt the tug of true sleep start to take me down. Emphasis on start. Because suddenly, I felt another spirit dream materializing around me. Apparently, this was going to be a busy night.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-10.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
