{"id":110941,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"I WOULD HAVE GAPED IF I were there, both from the shock of seeing Sydney and at the sight of a human on Court grounds. Humans, actually, because there were two others with her, a man and a woman. The man was young, only a little older than Sydney, with deep brown hair and eyes. The woman was older and wore the tough, seasoned look I associated with Alberta. This woman was dark-skinned, but I could still see the golden tattoo she and the other humans had. All Alchemists.\n And it was obvious these Alchemists were not happy. That older woman was putting on a good show, but her darting eyes made it clear she wanted to be somewhere-- anywhere--else. Sydney and the guy didn\u0027t hide their fear at all. Sydney might have gotten used to me and Dimitri, but she and her associates had just walked into a den of evil, as far as they were probably concerned.\n The Alchemists weren\u0027t alone in their discomfort. As soon as they\u0027d entered, the guardians no longer regarded Eddie as the room\u0027s threat. Their eyes were all on the humans, scrutinizing them as though they were Strigoi. My friends seemed more curious than afraid. Lissa and I had lived among humans, but Christian and Adrian had had very little exposure, other than feeders. Seeing the Alchemists on \"our turf\u0027 added an extra element of intrigue.\n I was certainly astonished to see Sydney there so quickly. Or was it quickly? Hours had passed since we\u0027d escaped Jill\u0027s house. Not enough time to drive to Court but certainly enough to fly. Sydney hadn\u0027t changed clothes since I\u0027d last seen her, and there were shadows under her eyes. I had a feeling she\u0027d been grilled to no end since her capture. The mystery was, why bring the Alchemists here to the meeting about Eddie killing the unknown Moroi? There were two completely different issues at stake.\n Lissa was thinking the same thing. \"Who are these guys?\u0027 she asked, although she had a pretty good idea who Sydney was. She\u0027d heard enough description from me. Sydney gave Lissa a once-over, and I suspected she had guessed Lissa\u0027s identity as well.\n \"Alchemists,\u0027 said Hans gruffly. \"You know what that means?\u0027\n Lissa and my friends nodded. \"What do they have to do with Eddie and that guy who attacked me?\u0027 she asked.\n \"Maybe something. Maybe nothing.\u0027 Hans shrugged. \"But I know there\u0027s something strange going on, something you\u0027re all involved in, and I need to figure out what. She\u0027-- Hans pointed at Sydney--\u0027was with Hathaway in Detroit, and I still have trouble believing none of you know anything about it.\u0027\n Adrian crossed his arms and leaned against the wall, the perfect picture of indifference. \"Keep believing that, but I don\u0027t know any of these people. Don\u0027t Alchemists hate us? Why are they here?\u0027 Adrian, ironically, was the only one of my friends who knew I hadn\u0027t been in West Virginia, but you\u0027d never tell from his demeanor.\n \"Because we have an escaped murderess to deal with and needed to question her accomplice in person,\u0027 was Hans\u0027s crisp response.\n A denial of my guilt was on Lissa\u0027s lips, but the older Alchemist jumped in first. \"You have no proof that Miss Sage was an \"accomplice\u0027 to your criminal. And I still think it\u0027s ridiculous that you wouldn\u0027t let us do our own questioning and leave it at that.\u0027 \"In any other situation, we would, Miss Stanton,\u0027 replied Hans. Ice was forming between the two of them. \"But this one, as you can imagine, is a bit more serious than most. Our queen was murdered.\u0027\n Tension ramped up even more between the guardians and the Alchemists. Their working relationship was not a happy one, I realized. It also occurred to me that even if Sydney\u0027s superiors thought she\u0027d committed some crime, they would never admit as much to my people--which meant Hans\u0027s paranoia wasn\u0027t entirely unfounded. When none of the Alchemists responded, Hans seemed to read this as approval to begin interrogating Sydney.\n \"Do you know these three?\u0027 He gestured to my friends, and Sydney shook her head. \"Ever communicated with them?\u0027\n \"No.\u0027\n He paused, as though hoping she\u0027d change her answer. She didn\u0027t. \"Then how did you get involved with Hathaway?\u0027\n She studied him intently, fear in her brown eyes. I wasn\u0027t sure if it was because of him exactly. Really, she had a lot of things to be nervous about right now, like being here at all and the eventual punishment the Alchemists would dole out. Then, of course, there was Abe. Technically, he was the reason she had gotten ensnared in this mess. All she had to do was tell on him, say he\u0027d blackmailed her. It\u0027d get her off the hook--but incur his wrath. Sydney swallowed and forced a defiant look.\n \"I met Rose in Siberia.\u0027\n \"Yes, yes,\u0027 said Hans. \"But how did you end up helping her escape here?\u0027\n \"I had nothing to do with her escaping this place!\u0027 said Sydney. It was a half-truth, I supposed. \"She contacted me a few days ago and asked for help to get to a house near Detroit. She claimed she was innocent and that this would help prove it.\u0027\n \"The Alchemists knew by then she was a fugitive,\u0027 pointed out Hans. \"Everyone had orders to look out for her. You could have turned her in.\u0027\n \"When I first met Rose, she didn\u0027t seem like the murdering type--I mean, aside from killing Strigoi. Which isn\u0027t murder at all, really.\u0027 Sydney threw in a little Alchemist disdain. It was a nice touch. \"So, when she said she was innocent and could prove it, I decided to help her. I gave her a ride.\u0027\n \"We already asked her about this,\u0027 Stanton said irritably. \"And we already told you that we did. What she did was foolish--a naive lapse in judgment. It\u0027s something for us to deal with, not you. You worry about your murdering fiend.\u0027 Her words were light, like they were going to take Sydney home and chastise a naughty child. I doubted it would be that simple.\n \"Who were the people with her?\u0027 asked Hans, ignoring Stanton.\n Sydney\u0027s contempt grew. \"One was that guy ... Dimitri Belikov. The one you think was \"cured.\u0027 I don\u0027t know who the others were. Two guys and a woman. They never introduced us.\u0027 It was a well-done lie, her faked disgust about Dimitri masking her knowledge of the rest of our associates.\n Lissa leaned forward eagerly, speaking just before Hans could. \"What was in Detroit? How was Rose going to clear herself? Especially with Jill?\u0027 Hans didn\u0027t look happy about the interruption, but I knew he had to be curious about Jill and Detroit as well. He said nothing, perhaps hoping someone might slip and reveal a key piece of knowledge. Sydney, however, continued playing distant and cold.\n \"I have no idea. That Jill girl didn\u0027t seem to know either. Rose just said we had to get to her, so I helped her.\u0027\n \"Blindly?\u0027 asked Hans. \"You really expect me to believe that you just trusted her like that?\u0027\n \"She\u0027s my--\u0027 Sydney bit her lip on what I suspected was \"friend.\u0027 She turned her professional mode back on. \"There was something believable about her, and I figured it\u0027d be a waste of resources if the Alchemists had been helping you hunt the wrong murderer. If I decided she was guilty, I could always turn her in. And I thought ... I thought if I was the one who solved this, I\u0027d get the credit and a promotion.\u0027 That was a good, good lie. An ambitious girl trying to improve her career on the sly? Very good. Well, not to everyone.\n Hans shook his head. \"I don\u0027t believe any of you.\u0027\n The guy Alchemist took a step forward that made every guardian tense to jump him. \"If she says that\u0027s the way it happened, then that\u0027s the way it happened.\u0027 He had the same fierceness and mistrust that Stanton had, but there seemed to be more. A sort of protectiveness toward Sydney that was as personal as professional. Lissa picked up on it too.\n \"Easy, Ian,\u0027 said Stanton, still keeping her eyes on Hans. Her composure reminded me more and more of Alberta. She couldn\u0027t be at ease with a roomful of guardians but wasn\u0027t showing it. \"It doesn\u0027t matter if you believe her or not. The point remains: Miss Sage answered your questions. We\u0027re finished.\u0027\n \"Do Jill\u0027s parents know anything?\u0027 asked Lissa. She was still in shock at all of these developments--not to mention worried about me being out of my safe mountain town-- but this mysterious shot at clearing my name was powerful. She couldn\u0027t let it go.\n Sydney turned to Lissa, and I could practically read the Alchemist\u0027s thoughts. She knew how close Lissa and I were and would have liked to give Lissa some sort of comfort. There was no way, though, that Sydney could do that with these people in the room. She also had to be aware of the fact that I myself hadn\u0027t told Lissa anything about Jill.\n \"No,\u0027 said Sydney. \"We just went there, and Rose said Jill had to come with her. The Mastranos don\u0027t know why. And then--and then Rose did take her. Or Jill went with her. I\u0027m not sure what happened. It all turned to chaos.\u0027\n Neither the Alchemists nor guardians disputed me taking Jill, which made me think it was a story they\u0027d gotten--and accepted--from both Jill\u0027s parents and Sydney. It had just enough truth to be plausible--and explain Jill\u0027s disappearance. It didn\u0027t mention the Dragomir secret, however, which Emily was probably more than happy to keep quiet for now.\n \"There,\u0027 said Stanton. \"This is exactly what we told you before. We need to leave now.\u0027 She turned toward the door, but guardians blocked the way.\n \"Impossible,\u0027 said Hans. \"This is a serious matter, and Miss Sage is the only link we have to a murder--a royal murder. And a kidnapping.\u0027 Stanton scoffed, and I remembered Sydney once saying the Alchemists thought the Moroi royalty system was silly. \"She doesn\u0027t seem to be of much more use to you. But don\u0027t worry--we\u0027ll be holding her. Contact us if you have more questions.\u0027\n \"Unacceptable,\u0027 said Hans. \"She stays here.\u0027\n Ian, the other Alchemist, joined the argument, moving protectively in front of Sydney. \"We\u0027re not leaving one of our own here!\u0027 Again, I had that funny feeling about him. A crush, that was it. He had a crush on her and was treating this as more than just business. Stanton gave him a look that said she would handle this matter. He fell silent.\n \"You can all stay here, then,\u0027 said Hans. \"Makes no difference to me. We\u0027ll get you rooms.\u0027\n \"That is unacceptable.\u0027 From there, she and Hans got into a raging argument. I didn\u0027t think it would come to blows, but the other guardians had closed in slightly as a precaution.\n Ian\u0027s eyes darted between Stanton and Sydney, but he didn\u0027t get into the fray. Once, his gaze passed over the table Hans leaned against, and Ian suddenly did a double take at the photograph. It was only a brief pause, a slight widening of the eyes ... but Lissa caught it.\n She took a step toward Ian and Sydney. One of the guardians glanced at the movement, deemed Lissa safe, and returned to watching Stanton. \"You know him,\u0027 Lissa murmured, keeping her voice below the shouts. In fact, it was a little too low because she got blank looks from Sydney and Ian. Their ears couldn\u0027t hear what a Moroi or dhampir could have.\n Lissa glanced uneasily around, not wanting to attract attention. She raised her volume slightly. \"You know him. The guy in the picture.\u0027\n Ian stared at Lissa, a bit of wonder and wariness on his face. He undoubtedly bore that same standoffish attitude toward vampires, but her words had caught him off guard. And, even if she was an evil creature of the night, she was a very pretty one.\n \"Ian,\u0027 said Sydney softly. \"What is it?\u0027 There was a note of urging in her voice, one that inadvertently played upon his crush, I think. He opened his mouth to speak, but then, the \"conversation\u0027 among the others wrapped up. Sydney again became the center of attention, and Ian turned away from Lissa.\n The compromise Stanton and Hans had reached was exactly that--a compromise. Neither was happy with it. There was a small town less than forty-five minutes away from Court, and the Alchemists would stay there--with several guardians on hand. It sounded like a house arrest to me, and Stanton\u0027s expression seemed to agree. I think she only consented because it was a human town. Before he\u0027d let everyone go, Hans questioned my friends a final time, his eyes studying every face carefully.\n \"And none of you--none of you--know this Alchemist girl or have been in contact with her? Or know about her involvement with Hathaway?\u0027\n Again, Lissa and the others denied it, and again, Hans had no choice but to grudgingly accept the responses. Everyone moved toward the door, but Hans wouldn\u0027t let Eddie leave. \"Not you, Castile. You\u0027re staying here until other matters are settled.\u0027\n Lissa gasped. \"What? But he--\u0027\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\u0027 said Eddie with a small smile. \"Everything\u0027ll be okay. Just look after yourself.\u0027 Lissa hesitated, despite Christian tugging her arm to go. Although all accounts said Eddie had defended Lissa\u0027s life, he\u0027d still killed a Moroi. That wouldn\u0027t be taken lightly. The guardians had to be 100 percent convinced he\u0027d had no other choice before they\u0027d release him. Seeing the strong, calm look on his face, Lissa knew he was prepared to handle whatever came.\n \"Thank you,\u0027 she said, walking past him. \"Thank you for saving me.\u0027\n His answer was a slight nod, and Lissa stepped into the hallway--to find herself in more chaos.\n \"Where are they? I insist on--ah.\u0027\n My friends and the Alchemists had been heading toward the exit while a group of guardians escorted them. Meanwhile, someone had entered the hall and was now being stopped and challenged by the guardians. It was Abe.\n He took in every piece of the bizarre scenario in less than a heartbeat, his eyes passing over Sydney and the Alchemists as though he\u0027d never seen them before. Through Lissa\u0027s eyes, I saw Sydney blanch, but nobody else noticed. Abe smiled at Lissa and sidled up to walk out with her.\n \"There you are. They want you for the last monarch test.\u0027\n \"And they sent you?\u0027 asked Christian skeptically.\n \"Well, I volunteered,\u0027 replied Abe. \"I\u0027d heard there was some, er, excitement. Murder, fanatical religious humans, interrogations. All things I\u0027m interested in, you know.\u0027\n Lissa rolled her eyes but said nothing until the whole group emerged from the building. The Alchemists and their unwelcome escort went one way while Lissa and our friends went the other. Lissa longed to glance at Sydney and Ian--I did too--but knew it was best to keep moving forward and follow Abe\u0027s lead, particularly since some of those guardians were watching more than just the Alchemists.\n As soon as Lissa\u0027s group was far enough away from the authorities, Abe\u0027s amiable smile vanished, and he turned on my friends. \"What the hell happened? I\u0027ve heard all sorts of crazy stories. Someone said you were dead.\u0027\n \"Nearly,\u0027 said Lissa. She told him about the attack, expressing her fear over Eddie.\n \"He\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 said Abe dismissively. \"They have nothing to hold him on. The worst he\u0027ll get is a mark on his record.\u0027\n Lissa was relieved by Abe\u0027s easy assurance, but I still felt guilty. Thanks to me, Eddie\u0027s record was already marred. His sterling reputation was declining on a daily basis.\n \"That was Sydney Sage,\u0027 said Lissa. \"I thought they were all in West Virginia. Why isn\u0027t she with Rose?\u0027\n \"That,\u0027 said Abe darkly, \"is an excellent question.\u0027\n \"Because they were apparently kidnapping Jill Mastrano in Detroit,\u0027 said Christian. \"Which is weird. But not the craziest thing I can think of Rose doing.\u0027 I appreciated the support.\n Abe got a recap of this new development too, at least as much as my friends knew of it--which was only a fraction of the whole story. Abe picked up immediately that he\u0027d been played, and it was obvious from his angry expression that he didn\u0027t like being kept in the dark. Welcome to the club, old man, I thought with small satisfaction. I hadn\u0027t forgotten how no one had filled me in on the escape plan. My smugness was short-lived because I was worried about what would happen to Sydney, now that Abe was on to her.\n \"That girl was lying to me,\u0027 he growled. \"Every day, all these reports about how quiet and boring it was in West Virginia. I wonder if they even made it to that town. I have to go talk to her.\u0027\n \"Good luck,\u0027 said Adrian, pulling a cigarette out and lighting it. Apparently, in my absence, the dating contract he\u0027d jokingly made up that said he would \"cut back\u0027 on his vices didn\u0027t apply. \"I don\u0027t think her cronies or the guardians are going to let you near her.\u0027\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll get to her,\u0027 said Abe. \"She\u0027s got a lot of answers. If she hid them from those other idiots, then good for her. But she\u0027s going to tell me.\u0027\n A sudden thought sparked into Lissa\u0027s mind. \"You have to talk to Ian. That guy with the Alchemists. He knows the man in the picture--er, I mean, the guy Eddie killed.\u0027\n \"You\u0027re certain?\u0027 asked Abe.\n \"Yes,\u0027 said Adrian, surprising them all. \"Ian definitely had a reaction. He\u0027s also got a crush on that Sydney girl.\u0027\n \"I saw that too,\u0027 said Lissa.\n \"She seems kind of uptight.\u0027 Adrian frowned. \"But maybe their kind go for that.\u0027\n \"That crush might actually be useful,\u0027 mused Abe. \"You women don\u0027t know the power you wield. Have you seen that guardian your aunt\u0027s dating? Ethan Moore?\u0027\n \"Yes,\u0027 groaned Christian. \"Don\u0027t remind me.\u0027\n \"Tasha is pretty hot, though,\u0027 noted Adrian.\n \"That is not cool,\u0027 said Christian.\n \"Don\u0027t get so huffy,\u0027 said Abe. \"Ethan\u0027s a palace guard. He was there the night of the murder--which could be very useful to us if she can keep him interested.\u0027\n Christian shook his head. \"Those guards already testified. It won\u0027t matter. Ethan\u0027s told what he knows.\u0027\n \"I\u0027m not so sure,\u0027 said Abe. \"There are always things that occur off the official record, and I\u0027m positive the guards were all debriefed with strict orders on what to reveal and not to reveal. Your aunt might be charming enough to find out something for us.\u0027 Abe sighed, still looking very unhappy at the sudden upsetting of his orderly plans. \"If only Sydney had been charming enough to talk her way out of that interrogation so that I could go interrogate her. Now I\u0027ve got to break through those Alchemists and the guardians to get to her and figure out where Rose is. Oh, and you do actually have to go to your test, princess.\u0027\n \"I thought that was just a line you used to find me,\u0027 Lissa said.\n \"No, they want you.\u0027 He gave her directions to the test. It was in the building she\u0027d had the second test in. \"All of you go together and then get a guardian to walk you back. Don\u0027t leave your room until Janine or Tad come by.\u0027 Tad was one of Abe\u0027s henchmen. \"No more surprise attacks.\u0027\n Lissa wanted to argue that she most certainly wasn\u0027t going to put herself under house arrest but decided it was best to just let Abe go for now. He hurried off, still radiating agitation, and she and the guys turned toward the testing site.\n \"Boy, is he pissed,\u0027 said Adrian. \"Do you blame him?\u0027 asked Christian. \"He just lost membership in the evil mastermind club. His brilliant plan fell apart, and now his daughter\u0027s missing when he thought she was somewhere safe.\u0027\n Adrian stayed pointedly silent.\n \"I hope she\u0027s okay,\u0027 sighed Lissa, a knot forming in her stomach. \"And what in the world does Jill have to do with any of this?\u0027\n Nobody had an answer for that one. When they reached the testing site, Lissa found a situation almost identical to before. Lots of spectators lining the hall. Guardians blocking the door. More people than ever were cheering her name as she approached, some who were \"common\u0027 Moroi and others who were royals whose candidates were out of the running. A number of nominees hadn\u0027t passed the fear test, so those families had switched their loyalties.\n Again, Lissa was ushered into the room alone. Her heart began to pound when she saw the same old woman. Were more terrible images to come? Lissa couldn\u0027t see the chalice, but that was no guarantee of safety. There was no extra chair, so Lissa simply stood in front of the old woman.\n \"Hello,\u0027 Lissa said respectfully. \"It\u0027s nice to see you again.\u0027\n The woman grinned, showing those missing teeth. \"I doubt that, but you say it very convincingly. You have politics in your blood.\u0027\n \"Thank ... you ...\u0027 said Lissa, unsure if she\u0027d been complimented or not. \"What would you like me to do for this test?\u0027\n \"Just listen. That\u0027s all. It\u0027s an easy one.\u0027\n A twinkle in the woman\u0027s eye made Lissa think this would not be easy.\n \"All you have to do is answer a question for me. Answer correctly, and you\u0027re through to the vote. And won\u0027t that be entertaining.\u0027 The old woman seemed to say those last words more to herself than Lissa.\n \"Okay,\u0027 said Lissa uneasily. \"I\u0027m ready.\u0027\n The woman sized Lissa up and seemed to like what she saw. \"Here it is then: What must a queen possess in order to truly rule her people?\u0027\n Lissa\u0027s mind went blank for a moment, and then a jumble of words popped into her head. Integrity? Wisdom? Sanity?\n \"No, no, don\u0027t answer,\u0027 said the old woman, watching Lissa carefully. \"Not yet. You have until tomorrow, at this same time, to think about it. Come back with the right answer, and you\u0027ll have passed the trials. And ...\u0027 She winked. \"It goes without saying you won\u0027t talk to anyone about this.\u0027\n Lissa nodded, rubbing the small tattooed spot on her arm. She\u0027d get no help with the answer from anyone else. Lissa left the room, turning the question over and over in her mind. There were too many answers to a question like that, she thought. Any of them could--\n Movement in my reality instantly snapped me out of her head. I half expected Sonya to come bursting into our tent, but no, that wasn\u0027t what had caught my attention. It was a much smaller motion ... and something infinitely more powerful.\n Dimitri was in my arms. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-27.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
