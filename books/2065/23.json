{"id":110938,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"THE FEW SECONDS OF SILENCE that followed seemed to stretch out to eternity. Everyone was confused, each for totally different reasons. Jill\u0027s initial surprise had been laced with excitement, but as she stared around from face to face, her smile faded and faded until she looked as bewildered as the rest of us.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\u0027 asked a new voice. Moments later, Emily Mastrano appeared beside her daughter. Emily glanced at me and Sydney with curiosity and then gasped when she saw the third member of our group. \"Sonya!\u0027 Emily jerked Jill back, her face filled with panic. Emily wasn\u0027t guardian-fast, but I admired her responsiveness.\n \"Emily ... ?\u0027 Sonya\u0027s voice was very small, on the verge of cracking. \"It ... it\u0027s me ... really me ...\u0027\n Emily tried to tug the man inside as well but stopped when she got a good look at Sonya. Like anyone else, Emily had to acknowledge the obvious. Sonya had no Strigoi features. Plus, she was out in broad daylight. Emily faltered and opened her mouth to speak, but her lips couldn\u0027t quite manage it. She finally turned to me.\n \"Rose ... what\u0027s going on?\u0027\n I was surprised that she would regard me as an authority, both because we\u0027d only met once and because I honestly wasn\u0027t sure what was going on either. It took me a few attempts to find my voice. \"I think ... I think we should come inside ...\u0027\n Emily\u0027s gaze fell back on Sonya. Jill tried to push forward to see what all the drama was about, but Emily continued blocking the door, still not totally convinced it was safe. I couldn\u0027t blame her. At last, she gave a slow nod and stepped away to give us access.\n Sydney\u0027s eyes flicked toward the car, where Victor, Robert, and Dimitri were waiting. \"What about them?\u0027 she asked me.\n I hesitated. I wanted Dimitri to be with me to drop the bombshell, but Emily might only be able to handle one thing at a time here. Moroi didn\u0027t have to run in royal circles to know who Victor Dashkov was or what he looked like. Our trip to Las Vegas had been proof of that. I shook my head at Sydney. \"They can wait.\u0027\n We settled into the family\u0027s living room and learned the guy who\u0027d answered the door was Emily\u0027s husband, John Mastrano. Emily went through the motions of offering us beverages, like this was a perfectly ordinary visit, but the look on her face confirmed she was still in shock. She handed us glasses of water like a robot, her face so pale she might have been Strigoi.\n John rested his hand on Emily\u0027s once she sat down. He kept giving us wary looks, but for her, he was all affection and concern. \"What\u0027s going on?\u0027 Emily\u0027s eyes were still dazed. \"I ... don\u0027t know. My cousin is here ... but I don\u0027t understand how ...\u0027 She looked back and forth at me, Sydney, and Sonya. \"How is this possible?\u0027 Her voice shook.\n \"It was Lissa, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 exclaimed Jill, who undoubtedly knew this relative\u0027s sordid history. She was understandably shocked--and a little nervous--but excitement was beginning to stir. \"I heard what happened with Dimitri. It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it? Lissa can heal Strigoi. She saved him. She saved ...\u0027 Jill turned toward Sonya, enthusiasm wavering a little. I wondered what kind of stories she\u0027d heard about Sonya. \"She saved you.\u0027\n \"Lissa didn\u0027t do it,\u0027 I said. \"Another, uh, spirit user did.\u0027\n Jill\u0027s face lit up. \"Adrian?\u0027 I\u0027d forgotten about her crush on him.\n \"No ... someone else. It\u0027s not important,\u0027 I added hastily. \"Sonya\u0027s ... well, she\u0027s Moroi again. Confused, though. Not quite herself.\u0027\n Sonya had been drinking in the sight of her cousin but now turned to me with a wry, knowing smile. \"I can speak for myself, Rose.\u0027\n \"Sorry,\u0027 I said.\n Emily turned to Sydney and frowned. They\u0027d been introduced, but no more. \"Why are you here?\u0027 Emily didn\u0027t have to say what she really meant. She wanted to know why a human was here. \"Are you a feeder?\u0027\n \"No!\u0027 exclaimed Sydney, jumping up from her spot beside me on the loveseat. I had never seen her filled with such outrage and disgust. \"Say that again, and I\u0027ll walk right out of here! I\u0027m an Alchemist.\u0027\n She was met with blank stares, and I pulled Sydney back down. \"Easy, girl. I don\u0027t think they don\u0027t know what Alchemists are.\u0027 Secretly, I was glad. When I\u0027d first discovered the Alchemists, I\u0027d felt like I was the last person in the world to find out. It was nice to know others were out of the loop too. Keeping things simple for now, I explained to Emily, \"Sydney\u0027s been helping us.\u0027\n Tears brimmed in Emily\u0027s blue eyes as she turned back to her cousin. Emily Mastrano was one of the most stunning women I\u0027d ever met. Even tears were beautiful on her. \"It\u0027s really you, isn\u0027t it? They brought you back to me. Oh God.\u0027 Emily rose and walked over to hold her cousin in a deep embrace. \"I\u0027ve missed you so much. I can\u0027t believe this.\u0027\n I almost felt like crying, too, but sternly reminded myself that we had come with a mission. I knew how startling this all was. We had just turned the Mastrano family\u0027s world upside down ... and I was about to complicate things even more. I hated to do it. I wished they could have the time they needed to adjust, to celebrate the miracle of having Sonya back. But the clock at Court--and on my life--was ticking.\n \"We brought her ...\u0027 I said at last. \"But there\u0027s another reason we\u0027re here.\u0027\n I don\u0027t know what tone my voice conveyed, but Emily stiffened and stepped back from Sonya, sitting down beside her husband. Somehow, in that moment, I think she knew why we were here. I could see in her eyes that she was afraid--as if she\u0027d been dreading this type of visit for years, as if she\u0027d imagined it a hundred times.\n I pushed forward. \"We know ... we know about Eric Dragomir.\u0027\n \"No,\u0027 said Emily, her voice an odd mixture of harshness and desperateness. Her obstinate manner was remarkably similar to Sonya\u0027s initial refusal to aid us. \"No. We are not doing this.\u0027 The instant I\u0027d seen Jill, the instant I\u0027d recognized those eyes, I\u0027d known we had the right place. Emily\u0027s words--more importantly, her lack of a denial--confirmed it.\n \"We have to,\u0027 I said. \"This is serious.\u0027\n Emily turned to Sonya. \"You promised! You promised you wouldn\u0027t tell!\u0027\n \"I didn\u0027t,\u0027 said Sonya, but her face wore its earlier doubt.\n \"She didn\u0027t,\u0027 I said firmly, hoping to reassure them both. \"It\u0027s hard to explain ... but she kept her promise.\u0027\n \"No,\u0027 repeated Emily. \"This isn\u0027t happening. We cannot talk about this.\u0027\n \"What ... what\u0027s going on?\u0027 demanded John. Anger kindled in his eyes. He didn\u0027t like seeing strangers upset his wife.\n I directed my words to Emily. \"We have to talk about this. Please. We need your help. We need her help.\u0027 I gestured to Jill.\n \"What do you mean?\u0027 asked Jill. That earlier eager spark was gone, cooled by her mother\u0027s reaction.\n \"It\u0027s about your--\u0027 I came to a stop. I\u0027d rushed into this, ready to find Lissa\u0027s sibling-- her sister, we now knew--with little thought of the implications. I should have known this would be a secret from everyone--including the child in question. I hadn\u0027t considered what a shock this would be to her. And this wasn\u0027t just some random stranger. This was Jill. Jill. My friend. The girl who was like a little sister to all of us, the one we looked out for. What was I about to do to her? Looking at John, I realized things were worse still. Did Jill think he was her father? This family was about to be shaken to its core-- and I was responsible.\n \"Don\u0027t!\u0027 cried Emily, jumping up again. \"Get out! All of you! I don\u0027t want you here!\u0027\n \"Mrs. Mastrano ...\u0027 I began. \"You can\u0027t pretend this isn\u0027t real. You have to face it.\u0027\n \"No!\u0027 she pointed to the door. \"Get out! Get out, or I\u0027ll ... I\u0027ll call the police! Or the guardians! You ...\u0027 Realization flashed over her now that the initial shock of seeing Sonya had faded. Victor wasn\u0027t the only criminal Moroi would be on guard for. \"You\u0027re a fugitive! A murderer!\u0027\n \"She is not!\u0027 said Jill, leaning forward. \"I told you, Mom. I told you before it was a mistake--\u0027\n \"Get out,\u0027 repeated Emily.\n \"Sending us away won\u0027t change the truth,\u0027 I said, forcing myself to stay calm.\n \"Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on?\u0027 John\u0027s face was flushed red, angry and defensive. \"If I don\u0027t have an answer within thirty seconds, I\u0027m calling the guardians and the police.\u0027\n I looked over at Jill and couldn\u0027t speak. I didn\u0027t know how to say what I needed to, at least not tactfully. Sydney, however, didn\u0027t have that problem.\n \"He\u0027s not your father,\u0027 she said bluntly, pointing at John.\n There was a slight pause in the room. Jill almost looked disappointed, like she\u0027d hoped for more exciting news.\n \"I know that. He\u0027s my stepdad. Or, well, my dad as far as I\u0027m concerned.\u0027\n Emily sank back on the couch, burying her face in her hands. She seemed to be crying, but I was pretty sure she could jump up at any moment and call the authorities. We had to get through this fast, no matter how painful. \"Right. He\u0027s not your biological father,\u0027 I said, looking steadily at Jill. The eyes. How had I never noticed the eyes? \u0027Eric Dragomir is.\u0027\n Emily made a low keening sound. \"No,\u0027 she begged. \"Please don\u0027t do this.\u0027\n John\u0027s anger morphed back to the confusion that seemed to be so in fashion in this room. \"What?\u0027\n \"That ... no.\u0027 Jill slowly shook her head. \"That\u0027s impossible. My father was just ... just some guy who ran out on us.\u0027\n In some ways, that wasn\u0027t far from the truth, I supposed. \"It was Eric Dragomir,\u0027 I said. \"You\u0027re part of their family. Lissa\u0027s sister. You\u0027re ...\u0027 I startled myself, realizing I had to look at Jill in a whole new way. \"You\u0027re royalty.\u0027\n Jill was always full of energy and optimism, operating in the world with a naive hope and charm. But now her face was grim and sober, making her look older than her fifteen years. \"No. This is a joke. My dad was a lowlife. I\u0027m not ... no. Rose, stop.\u0027\n \"Emily.\u0027 I flinched at the sound of Sonya\u0027s voice, surprised to hear her speak. I was more surprised at her expression. Authoritative. Serious. Determined. Sonya was younger than Emily by--what? Ten years, if I had to guess. But Sonya had fixed her cousin with a stare that made Emily look like a naughty child. \"Emily, it\u0027s time to give this up. You have to tell her. For God\u0027s sake, you have to tell John. You can\u0027t keep this buried anymore.\u0027\n Emily looked up and met Sonya\u0027s eyes. \"I can\u0027t tell. You know what will happen ... I can\u0027t do that to her.\u0027\n \"None of us know what will happen,\u0027 said Sonya. \"But things will get worse if you don\u0027t take control now.\u0027\n After a long moment, Emily finally looked away, staring at the floor. The sad, sad look on her face broke my heart. And not just mine.\n \"Mom?\u0027 asked Jill, voice trembling. \"What\u0027s happening? This is all a big mix-up, right?\u0027\n Emily sighed and looked up at her daughter. \"No. You are Eric Dragomir\u0027s daughter. Rose is right.\u0027 John made a small, strangled sound but didn\u0027t interrupt his wife. She squeezed his hand again. \"What I told you both over the years ... it was true. Mostly. We did just have a brief ... relationship. Not a cheap one, exactly. But brief.\u0027 She paused and glanced over at John this time, her expression softening. \"I told you ...\u0027\n He nodded. \"And I told you the past didn\u0027t matter to me. Never affected how I felt about you, about Jill. But I never imagined ...\u0027\n \"Me neither,\u0027 she agreed. \"I didn\u0027t even know who he was when we first met. It was back when I lived in Las Vegas and had my first job, dancing in a show at the Witching Hour.\u0027\n I felt my eyes go wide. No one seemed to notice. The Witching Hour. My friends and I had been to that casino while hunting for Robert, and a man there had made a joke about Lissa\u0027s father being interested in showgirls. I knew Emily worked in a Detroit ballet company now; it was why they lived in Michigan. Never would I have guessed that she\u0027d started as a feather-and-sequin-clad dancer in a Las Vegas show. But why not? She would have had to start somewhere, and her tall, graceful frame would lend itself well to any type of dancing.\n \"He was so sweet ... and so sad,\u0027 Emily continued. \"His father had just died, and he\u0027d come to sort of drown his sorrows. I understood how a death would devastate him, but now ... well, I really understand. It was another loss to his family. The numbers were dropping.\u0027 She frowned thoughtfully and then shrugged. \"He was a good man, and I think he truly loved his wife. But he was in a dark, low place. I don\u0027t think he was using me. He cared about me, though I doubt what happened between us would have in other circumstances. Anyway, I was fine with the way things ended and was content to move on with my life ... until Jill came along. I contacted Eric because I thought he should know--though I made it clear I didn\u0027t expect anything from him. And at that point, knowing who he was, I didn\u0027t want anything. If I\u0027d let him, I think he would have acknowledged you, had a role in your life.\u0027 Emily\u0027s eyes were on Jill now. \"But I\u0027ve seen what that world is like. Court life is politics and lies and backstabbing. In the end, the only thing I\u0027d accept from him was money. I still didn\u0027t want that. I didn\u0027t want to feel like I was blackmailing him--but I did want to make sure your future was secure.\u0027\n I spoke without thinking. \"You don\u0027t really live like you\u0027re using that money.\u0027 I regretted the words as soon as they were out. Their home was perfectly nice, hardly the depths of poverty. But it also didn\u0027t match the funds I\u0027d seen moved around in those bank accounts.\n \"I\u0027m not,\u0027 said Emily. \"It\u0027s on hand for emergencies, of course, but mostly I set it all aside for Jill, for her future. To do whatever she wants.\u0027\n \"What do you mean?\u0027 asked Jill, aghast. \"What kind of money are you talking about?\u0027\n \"You\u0027re an heiress,\u0027 I said. \"And royalty.\u0027\n \"I\u0027m not any of those things,\u0027 she said. She was frantic now, looking around at all of us. She reminded me of a deer, ready to bolt. \"There\u0027s a mistake. You\u0027ve all made some mistake.\u0027\n Emily stood up and walked over to Jill\u0027s chair, kneeling on the floor before it. Emily clasped her daughter\u0027s hand. \"It is all true. And I\u0027m sorry you have to find out like this. But it doesn\u0027t change anything. Our lives aren\u0027t going to change. We\u0027ll go on just like we have before.\u0027\n A range of emotions raced over Jill\u0027s features--especially fear and confusion--but she leaned down and buried her face against her mother\u0027s shoulder in acceptance. \"Okay.\u0027\n It was a touching moment, and again, I almost felt like crying. I\u0027d had my own share of family drama and parental issues. Like before, I wanted the Mastranos to have this moment--but they couldn\u0027t.\n \"You can\u0027t,\u0027 I told them. \"You can\u0027t go on like before. Jill ... Jill has to go to Court.\u0027\n Emily jerked away from Jill and stared at me. Only a second ago, Emily had been full of grief and distress. Now, I saw intense anger and ferocity. Her blue eyes were stormy, fixing me with a sharp glare. \"No. She is not going there. She is never going there.\u0027\n Jill had already visited Court before, but both Emily and I knew that I wasn\u0027t referring to some casual sightseeing trip. Jill had to go with her true identity. Well-- maybe true wasn\u0027t the right word. Illicit royalty wasn\u0027t part of her nature, at least not yet. She was who she\u0027d always been, but her name had changed. That change had to be acknowledged, and the Moroi Court would be shaken.\n \"She has to,\u0027 I urged. \"The Court\u0027s getting corrupted, and the Dragomir family has to play its part to help fix things. Lissa has no power alone, not without a family quorum. All the other royals ... they\u0027re trampling her. They\u0027re going to push laws that won\u0027t help any of us.\u0027\n Emily still knelt by the chair, as though shielding Jill from my words. \"And that\u0027s exactly why Jill can\u0027t go. It\u0027s why I wouldn\u0027t let Eric acknowledge her. I don\u0027t want Jill involved. That place is poison. Tatiana\u0027s murder is proof.\u0027 Emily paused and gave me a sharp look, reminding me that I was the chief suspect. Apparently we weren\u0027t past that yet. \"All those royals ... they\u0027re vicious. I don\u0027t want Jill turning into one of them. I won\u0027t let her turn into one of them.\u0027\n \"Not all royals are like that,\u0027 I argued. \"Lissa\u0027s not. She\u0027s trying to change the system.\u0027\n Emily gave me a bitter smile. \"And how do you think the others feel about her reform? I\u0027m sure there are royals who are happy to see her silenced--royals who wouldn\u0027t like to see her family reemerge. I told you: Eric was a good man. Sometimes I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a coincidence their family has died out.\u0027\n I gaped. \"That\u0027s ridiculous.\u0027 But I suddenly wasn\u0027t so sure.\n \"Is it?\u0027 Emily\u0027s eyes were on me, as though guessing my doubts. \"What do you think they\u0027d do if another Dragomir came forward? The people who oppose Vasilisa? What do you think they\u0027d do if only one person stood between them and her family\u0027s power?\u0027\n Her implications were shocking ... yet, I knew they weren\u0027t impossible. Glancing over at Jill, I felt an empty, sinking feeling in my stomach. What would I be subjecting her to? Sweet, innocent Jill. Jill wanted adventure out of life and could still barely talk to guys without blushing. Her desire to learn to fight was half-youthful impulse and half-instinct to defend her people. Stepping into the royal world could technically help her people too--though not in a way she\u0027d ever expected. And it would mean getting involved with the dark and sinister nature that sometimes filled the Court.\n Emily seemed to read my silence as agreement. A mix of triumph and relief crossed her face, all of which vanished when Jill suddenly spoke up.\n \"I\u0027ll do it.\u0027\n We all turned to stare. Thus far, I\u0027d been regarding her with pity, thinking of her as a victim. Now, I was startled at how brave and resolved she looked. Her expression was still underscored with a little fear and shock, but there was a steel in her I\u0027d never seen before.\n \"What?\u0027 exclaimed Emily.\n \"I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 said Jill, voice steadier. \"I\u0027ll help Lissa and ... and the Dragomirs. I\u0027ll go with Rose back to Court.\u0027\n I decided mentioning the myriad difficulties of me getting anywhere near Court wasn\u0027t important just then. Honestly, I had reached a point where I was playing all of this by ear, though it was a relief to see Emily\u0027s fury shifted away from me.\n \"You will not! I\u0027m not letting you near there.\u0027\n \"You can\u0027t make this choice for me!\u0027 cried Jill. \"I\u0027m not a child.\u0027\n \"And you\u0027re certainly not an adult,\u0027 retorted Emily.\n The two began arguing back and forth, and soon John jumped in to support his wife. In the midst of the family bickering, Sydney leaned toward me and murmured, \"I bet you never thought the hardest part of finding your \"savior\u0027 would be getting her mom to let her stay out past curfew.\u0027 The unfortunate part about her joke was that it was kind of true. We needed Jill, and I certainly hadn\u0027t envisioned this complication. What if Emily refused? Clearly, keeping Jill\u0027s heritage a secret was something she\u0027d been pretty adamant about for a while-- say, like, fifteen years. I had a feeling Jill wouldn\u0027t be beyond running away to Court if it came down to that. And I wouldn\u0027t be beyond helping her.\n Once more, Sonya jumped into the conversation unexpectedly. \"Emily, didn\u0027t you hear me? This is all going to happen eventually, with or without your consent. If you don\u0027t let Jill go now, she\u0027ll go next week. Or next year. Or in five years. The point is, it will happen.\u0027\n Emily sank back against the chair, face crumpling. \"No. I don\u0027t want this.\u0027\n Sonya\u0027s pretty face turned bitter. \"Life, unfortunately, doesn\u0027t seem to care what we want. Act now while you can actually stop it from being a disaster.\u0027\n \"Please, Mom,\u0027 begged Jill. Her jade Dragomir eyes regarded Emily with affection. I knew Jill might indeed disobey and run off--but she didn\u0027t want to, not if she didn\u0027t have to.\n Emily stared into the distance, long-lashed eyes vacant and defeated. And although she was standing in the way of my plans, I knew she did it out of legitimate love and concern--traits that had probably drawn Eric to her.\n \"Okay,\u0027 said Emily at last. She sighed. \"Jill can go--but I\u0027m going too. You aren\u0027t facing that place without me.\u0027\n \"Or me,\u0027 said John. He still seemed bewildered but was determined to support his wife and stepdaughter. Jill regarded them both with gratitude, reminding me again that I\u0027d just turned a functional family dysfunctional. Emily and John coming with us hadn\u0027t been part of my plans, but I couldn\u0027t blame them and didn\u0027t see what harm they\u0027d cause. We\u0027d need Emily anyway to tell everyone about Eric.\n \"Thank you,\u0027 I said. \"Thank you so much.\u0027\n John eyed me. \"We still haven\u0027t dealt with the fact that there\u0027s a fugitive in our home.\u0027\n \"Rose didn\u0027t do it!\u0027 That fierceness was still in Jill. \"It was a setup.\u0027\n \"It was.\u0027 I hesitated to speak my next words. \"Probably by the people opposing Lissa.\u0027\n Emily paled, but I felt the need for honesty, even if it reaffirmed her fears. She took a steadying breath. \"I believe you. Believe that you didn\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t know why ... but I do.\u0027 She almost smiled. \"No, I do know why. It\u0027s because of what I said before, about those vipers at Court. They\u0027re the ones who do this kind of thing. Not you.\u0027\n \"Are you sure?\u0027 asked John uneasily. \"This mess with Jill is bad enough without us housing a criminal.\u0027\n \"I\u0027m certain,\u0027 said Emily. \"Sonya and Jill trust Rose, and so I do. You\u0027re all welcome to stay here tonight since we can hardly head out to Court right now.\u0027\n I opened my mouth to say we most certainly could leave right now, but Sydney elbowed me sharply. \"Thank you, Mrs. Mastrano,\u0027 she said, summoning up that Alchemist diplomacy. \"That would be great.\u0027\n I repressed a scowl. Time was still pressing on me, but I knew the Mastranos were entitled to make some preparations. It was probably better to travel in the daytime too. A rough check of my mental map made me think we could do the whole drive back to Court in one day. I nodded in agreement with Sydney, resigning myself to a sleepover at the Mastrano house. \"Thanks. We appreciate it.\u0027 Suddenly, something occurred to me, summoning back John\u0027s words. This mess with Jill is bad enough without us housing a criminal. I gave Emily as convincing and reassuring a smile as I could muster. \"We, um, also have some friends with us waiting out in the car ...\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-23.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
