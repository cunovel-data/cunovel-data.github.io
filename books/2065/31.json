{"id":110945,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"I WASN\u0027T THE ONLY ONE who had come to that startling conclusion. When the Moroi Court woke up several hours into our road trip, Lissa was also putting all the pieces together in her room as she prepared herself to give her pre-election speech. She\u0027d thought of all the arguments I had, plus a few more--like how frantic Daniella had been that Adrian might be implicated with me, which would undoubtedly unravel a carefully laid out plan. There was also Daniella\u0027s offer of having her lawyer cousin, Damon Tarus, defend me. Would that have actually helped? Or would Damon have subtly worked to weaken my defense? Abe\u0027s uncouth involvement might have been a blessing.\n Lissa\u0027s heart pounded rapidly as she twisted her hair into a chignon. She preferred it down but thought for the coming event, she should put on a more dignified look. Her dress was matte ivory silk, long-sleeved and ruched, about knee length. Some might have thought wearing that color would make her look bridal, but when I saw her in the mirror, I knew no one would make that mistake. She looked luminous. Radiant. Queenly.\n \"It can\u0027t be true,\u0027 she said, completing the look with pearl earrings that had belonged to her mother. She had shared her theory with Christian and Janine, who were with her now, and had half hoped they\u0027d tell her she was crazy. They hadn\u0027t.\n \"It makes sense,\u0027 said Christian, with none of his usual snark.\n \"There\u0027s just no proof quite yet,\u0027 my mother said, ever practical. \"Lots of circumstantial stuff.\u0027\n \"Aunt Tasha\u0027s checking with Ethan to see if Daniella was there the night of the murder,\u0027 said Christian. He made a slight face, still not happy about his aunt having a boyfriend. \"Daniella wasn\u0027t on the official lists, but Aunt Tasha\u0027s worried some things might have been altered.\u0027\n \"That wouldn\u0027t surprise me. Even so, putting Daniella there at the right time builds the case but still isn\u0027t hard proof.\u0027 My mother should have been an attorney. She and Abe could have opened a law firm together.\n \"It\u0027s as much proof as they\u0027ve got for Rose!\u0027 exclaimed Lissa.\n \"Aside from the stake,\u0027 Janine reminded her. \"And people are more willing to believe sketchy evidence about Rose than Lady Daniella Ivashkov.\u0027\n Lissa sighed, knowing it was all true. \"If only Abe could talk to the Alchemists. We need what they know.\u0027\n \"He\u0027ll do it,\u0027 said my mother confidently. \"It\u0027ll just take time.\u0027\n \"We don\u0027t have time!\u0027 The dramatic turn of events was giving spirit a nice chance to raise its ugly head, and like always, I tried to pull the darkness from Lissa. You\u0027d think I would have learned my lesson after Victor, but well ... old habits died hard. They come first. \u0027Marie Conta and Rufus Tarus are the only candidates left! If he wins, Daniella\u0027s going to have a lot of influence. We\u0027ll never prove Rose is innocent then.\u0027\n Ariana failing the last test had come as a huge blow to everyone, smashing a future Lissa had thought was set in stone. Without Ariana, the outcome didn\u0027t look good. Marie Conta wasn\u0027t Lissa\u0027s favorite person, but Lissa felt she\u0027d make a much better ruler than Rufus. Unfortunately, the Conta family had been quiet in politics in recent years, giving them fewer allies and friends. The numbers were leaning dangerously toward Rufus. It was frustrating. If we could get Jill there, Lissa could vote, and on a Council of twelve, even one vote would be powerful.\n \"We have time,\u0027 my mom said calmly. \"There\u0027ll be no vote today, not with the controversy you\u0027ll cause. And for every day the election is delayed, we have another chance to build our case. We\u0027re close. We can do it.\u0027\n \"We can\u0027t tell Adrian about this,\u0027 warned Lissa, moving toward the door. It was time to go.\n Christian\u0027s trademark smirk returned. \"That,\u0027 he said, \"is something we can all agree on.\u0027\n The elaborate ballroom--yet again made a Council room for size reasons--looked like a rock concert. People were fighting for spots inside. Some, realizing that was futile, had camped outside the building, picnic style. Someone had thankfully had the brilliant idea to hook up a sound system with outdoor speakers so that those who didn\u0027t make it in could still hear the proceedings. Guardians moved through the crowds, trying to contain the chaos--particularly as the candidates arrived.\n Marie Conta had shown up just before Lissa, and even if she was the least-likely candidate, there were still roars and surges of excitement in the crowd. Guardians hastily--and roughly, if necessary--held the mob back so she could pass. That attention had to be scary, but Marie didn\u0027t show it. She walked proudly, smiling at supporters and non-supporters alike. Both Lissa and I recalled Christian\u0027s words: You\u0027re a queenly nominee. Act like it. You deserve this. You\u0027re the last Dragomir. A daughter of royalty.\n And that was exactly how she behaved. It was more than Christian\u0027s urging, too. Now that she\u0027d passed all three tests, the gravity of the ancient procedure she was entering continued to grow. Lissa walked in, her head held high. I couldn\u0027t see her whole body, but I recognized the feel of her walk: graceful, stately. The crowd loved it, and it occurred to me that this group was particularly vocal because most weren\u0027t royal. Those gathered outside were ordinary Moroi, the ones who had come to truly love her. \"Alexandra\u0027s heir!\u0027 \"Bring back the dragon!\u0027 For some, it was simply enough to shout her name, adding on the titles of an old Russian folktale heroine who shared the same name: \"Vasilisa the brave! Vasilisa the beautiful!\u0027\n I knew no one would guess the fear she felt inside. She was that good. Christian and my mother, who had initially flanked her, fell back as one, letting Lissa walk a couple steps ahead. There was no question of Lissa\u0027s position and authority. She took each step with confidence, remembering that her grandfather had also walked this path. She tried to give the crowd a smile that was both dignified but genuine. It must have worked because they went even wilder. And when she paused to comment on a dragon banner a man had painted in support, the artist nearly passed out that someone like her would notice and compliment him.\n \"This is unprecedented,\u0027 remarked my mom, once they\u0027d safely made it inside. \"There\u0027s never been this sort of turnout. There certainly wasn\u0027t during the last election.\u0027\n \"Why so great this time?\u0027 asked Lissa, who was trying to get her breathing under control.\n \"Because there\u0027s so much sensation, between the murder and you muddling the law. That and ... well, the way you\u0027re winning the hearts of every non-royal out there. The dhampirs too. There\u0027s a dragon sign in one of our coffee rooms, you know. I even think some of the royals love you, though maybe it\u0027s just to spite whatever family they\u0027re feuding with. But seriously? If this were up to all of the people and not just the Council-- and well, if it was a vote you were eligible for--I think you\u0027d win.\u0027\n Lissa grimaced but then reluctantly added, \"Honestly? I think we should have popular votes for our leaders. Every Moroi should cast a vote, not just a handful of elite families.\u0027\n \"Careful there, princess,\u0027 teased Christian, putting his arm through hers. \"That\u0027s the kind of talk that\u0027ll start another revolution. One at a time, okay?\u0027\n The ballroom\u0027s crowd wasn\u0027t as crazy as the outside one had been--but was pretty close. The guardians were ready for the numbers this time and had made sure to keep strict control from the very beginning. They kept a tight count of how many were allowed in the room and stopped royal and non-royal squabbles. It was still intimidating, and Lissa reminded herself over and over that playing this role was helping me. For me, she would endure anything, even the fanfare. This time, fortunately, Lissa was swept up pretty quickly to the room\u0027s front, to where three chairs facing the crowd had been set up for the candidates. Rufus and Marie were already seated, speaking in low voices to a few select family members. Guardians stood around them. Lissa sat alone, of course, but nodded to nearby guards when Tasha approached.\n Tasha crouched beside Lissa, speaking low and keeping a wary eye on Rufus as he talked to someone. \"Bad news. Well, depending on how you look at it. Ethan says Daniella was there that night. She and Tatiana met alone. He didn\u0027t realize it hadn\u0027t been put on the records. Someone else wrote those up on behalf of all the guards on duty, but he swears he saw Daniella himself.\u0027\n Lissa winced. Secretly, she\u0027d been hoping--praying, even--that she\u0027d made a mistake, that surely Adrian\u0027s mother couldn\u0027t have done this. She gave a swift nod to show she understood.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 said Tasha. \"I know you liked her.\u0027\n \"I think I\u0027m more worried about Adrian. I don\u0027t know how he\u0027ll take it.\u0027\n \"Hard,\u0027 said Tasha bluntly. After what she\u0027d faced with Christian\u0027s parents, she knew better than anyone else what it was like to have family betray you. \"But he\u0027ll make it through. And as soon as we can put all this evidence forward, we\u0027ll have Dimitri and Rose back.\u0027\n Those words filled Lissa with hope, strengthening her. \"I miss her so much,\u0027 she said. \"I wish she was here already.\u0027\n Tasha gave her a sympathetic smile and patted her shoulder. \"Soon. They\u0027ll be back soon. Just get through this for now. You can do this. You can change everything.\u0027\n Lissa wasn\u0027t so sure about that, but Tasha hurried off to join her \"activist friends\u0027 and was replaced by--Daniella.\n She\u0027d come to talk to Rufus, offering support and family love. Lissa couldn\u0027t bear to look at the older woman and felt even worse when Daniella spoke to her.\n \"I\u0027m not sure how you got involved with this, dear, but good luck.\u0027 Daniella\u0027s smile seemed sincere, but there was no question which candidate she supported. Her kindly expression turned to concern. \"Have you seen Adrian? I thought for sure he\u0027d be here. I know the guardians would let him in.\u0027\n Excellent question. Lissa hadn\u0027t seen him in the last day or so. \"I haven\u0027t. Maybe he\u0027s just running late. Doing his hair or something.\u0027 Hopefully not passed out somewhere.\n Daniella sighed. \"I hope so.\u0027\n She left, taking a seat in the audience. Once again, Adrian\u0027s father was running the session, and after several false starts, the room quieted.\n \"In the last week,\u0027 Nathan began, speaking into a microphone, \"many worthy candidates have taken the tests required to rule our people. Before us sit the final three: Rufus Tarus, Marie Conta, and Vasilisa Dragomir.\u0027 Nathan\u0027s tone sounded displeased over that last one, but thus far, the law would let her give her speech. After that, the law\u0027s inconsistency kicked in, and all hell would break loose.\n \"These three have shown they have the ability to rule, and as their last act, before we vote, each will speak about their plans for our people.\u0027 Rufus was up first, delivering exactly the kind of speech I\u0027d expected. He played on Moroi fears, promising extreme forms of protection--most of which involved dhampirs but didn\u0027t get into much detail.\n \"Our safety must be our top priority,\u0027 he proclaimed. \"At all costs. Will it be difficult? Yes. Will there be sacrifices? Yes. But aren\u0027t our children worth it? Don\u0027t we care about them?\u0027 Bringing children into it was just low, I decided. At least he\u0027d left puppies out.\n He also used dirty politician tricks, slandering his rivals. Marie was mostly slammed for her family\u0027s lack of activity. Lissa, however, was a great target. He pushed her age, the danger of spirit, and the fact that her being there in the first place was a violation of the law.\n Marie\u0027s speech was much more thoughtful and detailed. She laid out very explicit plans on all sorts of issues, most of which were reasonable. I didn\u0027t agree with all she said, but she was clearly competent and didn\u0027t lower herself to mocking her competition. Unfortunately, she wasn\u0027t nearly as charismatic as Rufus, and it was a sad truth that that could make a big difference. Her monotone closing summed up not only her speech but also her personality.\n \"Those are the reasons why I should be queen. I hope you enjoyed this talk and will vote for me when the time comes. Thank you.\u0027 She abruptly sat down.\n Lissa\u0027s turn came at last. Standing before her microphone, she suddenly saw the chalice\u0027s dream, where she\u0027d faltered in front of the Council. But no, this was reality. She wouldn\u0027t fail. She would go forward.\n \"We\u0027re a people at war,\u0027 she began, voice loud and clear. \"We\u0027re constantly attacked--but not just by Strigoi. By one another. We\u0027re divided. We fight with one another. Family against family. Royal against non-royal. Moroi against dhampir. Of course the Strigoi are picking us off. They\u0027re at least united behind a goal: killing.\u0027\n If I had been sitting there in that audience, I would have been leaning forward, mouth open. As it was, there were plenty of people there to do it for me. Her words were volatile. Shocking. And utterly captivating.\n \"We are one people,\u0027 she continued. \"Moroi and dhampir alike.\u0027 Yeah, that got some gasps too. \"And while it\u0027s impossible for every single person to get their way, no one will get anything done if we don\u0027t come together and find ways to meet in the middle--even if it means making hard choices.\u0027\n Then, extraordinarily, she explained how it could be done. True, she didn\u0027t have the time to give fine details on every single issue in our world, but she hit a lot of the big ones. And she managed to do it in a way that didn\u0027t offend anyone too badly. After all, she was right in saying not everyone could get their way. Still, she spoke about how the dhampirs were our best warriors--and would be better with a stronger voice. She spoke about how non-royals needed a greater voice too--but not at the cost of losing the exalted royal lines that defined our people. Finally, in addressing the issue of training Moroi to defend themselves, she did emphasize its importance--but not as something mandatory and not as the only method needing to be explored.\n Yes, she gave something to everyone and did it beautifully and charismatically. It was the kind of speech that could make people follow her anywhere. She concluded with, \"We have always mixed the old with the new. We\u0027ve kept magic alongside technology. We conduct these sessions with scrolls and--with these.\u0027 She smiled and tapped her microphone. \"That\u0027s how we have survived. We hold onto our pasts and embrace our present. We take the best of it all and grow stronger. That\u0027s how we have survived. That\u0027s how we will survive.\u0027\n Silence met her conclusion--and then the cheers began. I actually heard the roar from outside on the lawn before it started within. People I would have sworn supported others were practically in tears, and I hadn\u0027t forgotten that most of the people I had visuals on in this room were royal. Lissa herself wanted to burst into tears but instead took her due bravely. When she finely sat down, and the crowd quieted, Nathan resumed his role. \"Well,\u0027 he said. \"That was a very pretty speech, one we all enjoyed. But now, the time has come for the Council to vote on our next leader, and--by law--only two candidates stand ready for that position: Rufus Tarus and Marie Conta.\u0027 Two Moroi, one each from the Tarus and Conta families, came forward to join their respective candidates. Nathan\u0027s gaze fell on Lissa who had risen like the others but stood alone. \"According to the election laws--laws set down since the beginning of time--each candidate must approach the Council, escorted by someone of their bloodline in order to show family strength and unity. Do you have any such person?\u0027\n Lissa met his eyes unflinchingly. \"No, Lord Ivashkov.\u0027\n \"Then I\u0027m afraid your part in this game is over, Princess Dragomir.\u0027 He smiled. \"You may sit down now.\u0027\n Yup. That\u0027s when all hell broke loose.\n I\u0027d always heard the expression, \"And the crowd goes wild!\u0027 Now, I saw it in the flesh. Half the time, I couldn\u0027t even keep track of who was shouting or supporting what. People argued in clusters and one-on-one. A couple of Moroi in jeans challenged every well-dressed person they could find, operating under the irrational assumptions that anyone in nice clothes must be royal and that all royals hated Lissa. Their devotion to her was admirable. Creepy, but admirable. One group from the Tarus family stood face to face with a Conta group, looking prepared for either a gang fight or a dance-off. That was one of the most bizarre pairings of all since those two families were the only ones who should be in complete agreement on anything.\n On and on it went. People fought about whether Lissa should be eligible for the vote. They fought about having a session to change the law books right at that moment. Some fought over things I\u0027d never even heard of before. A rush of guardians to the door made me think the outside crowd was trying to break in. My mother was among that defense, and I knew she\u0027d been right: there\u0027d be no vote today, not with this anarchy. They\u0027d have to close the session and try again tomorrow.\n Lissa stared at the crowd, feeling numb and unable to keep up with all the activity. Her stomach twisted as something dawned on her. All this time, she\u0027d sworn that she\u0027d respect the dignity of the election tradition. Yet, it was because of her that things were now anything but dignified. It was all her fault. Then, her eyes fell on someone sitting in a back corner, far from the pandemonium. Ekaterina Zeklos. The old former queen caught Lissa\u0027s eye--and winked.\n I faded out of that room, not needing to see any more of the arguing. I returned to the car ride, a new thought in my head. Lissa\u0027s words burned in my soul. They had stirred my heart. And even if she\u0027d given her speech as a decoy, there had been passion in them--ardent belief. If she had been eligible to be queen, she would have stood behind those words.\n And that\u0027s when I knew. She would be queen.\n I decided then and there that I would make it happen. We wouldn\u0027t bring Jill simply to give Lissa her Council vote. Jill would give Lissa the status that would allow Moroi to vote for her. And Lissa would win.\n Naturally, I kept these thoughts to myself.\n \"That\u0027s a dangerous look,\u0027 said Dimitri, giving me a brief glance before returning his eyes to the road.\n \"What look?\u0027 I asked innocently.\n \"The one that says you just got some idea.\u0027\n \"I didn\u0027t just get an idea. I got a great idea.\u0027\n Jokes like that used to make Jill laugh, but turning to look at her in the backseat showed me she didn\u0027t find much funny at all.\n \"Hey, you okay?\u0027 I asked.\n Those jade eyes focused on me. \"I\u0027m not sure. A lot\u0027s kind of happened. And I don\u0027t really get what\u0027s going to happen next. I feel like ... like some kind of object that\u0027s going to be used in someone\u0027s master plan. Like a pawn.\u0027\n A bit of guilt tugged at me. Victor had always used people as part of a game. Was I any different? No. I cared about Jill. \"You\u0027re not an object or a pawn,\u0027 I told her. \"But you\u0027re very, very important, and because of you, a lot of good things are going to happen.\u0027\n \"It won\u0027t be that simple though, will it?\u0027 She sounded wise beyond her years. \"Things are going to get worse before they get better, aren\u0027t they?\u0027\n I couldn\u0027t lie to her. \"Yeah. But then you\u0027ll get to contact your mom ... and well, like I said, good things will happen. Guardians always say \"They come first\u0027 when we\u0027re talking about Moroi. It\u0027s not exactly the same for you, but in doing this ... well ...\u0027\n She gave me a smile that didn\u0027t seem very happy. \"Yeah, I get it. It\u0027s for the greater good, right?\u0027\n Sonya had spent a lot of the ride working on a charm for me, using a silver bracelet we\u0027d bought at a roadside gift shop. It was tacky-looking but made of real silver, which was what counted. When we were about a half hour from Greenston, she deemed it finished and handed it over. I slipped it on and looked at the others.\n \"Well?\u0027\n \"I don\u0027t see anything,\u0027 said Sonya, \"but then, I wouldn\u0027t.\u0027\n Jill squinted. \"You seem a little blurry ... like I just need to blink a few times.\u0027\n \"Same here,\u0027 said Dimitri.\n Sonya was pleased. \"That\u0027s how it should look to people who know she\u0027s got a charm on. Hopefully, to the other guardians, she\u0027ll be wearing a different face.\u0027 It was a variation of what Lissa had made when we\u0027d busted Victor out of prison. Only, this required less magic because Sonya only had to slightly alter my features and didn\u0027t need to obscure my race. She was also more practiced than Lissa.\n The restaurant I\u0027d chosen in Greenston had long since closed when we rolled in at eleven thirty. The parking lot was nearly black, but I could make out a car in the back corner. Hopefully, it was Mikhail having gotten there early--and not a guardian hit squad.\n But when we parked nearby, I saw that it was indeed Mikhail who got out of the car-- along with Adrian.\n He grinned when he saw me, pleased at the surprise. Really, I should have seen this coming when I\u0027d told him to pass the message on to Mikhail. Adrian would have found a way to come along. My stomach rolled. No, no. Not this. I had no time to deal with my love life. Not now. I didn\u0027t even know what to say to Adrian. Fortunately, I wasn\u0027t given the chance to speak.\n Mikhail had come striding toward us with guardian efficiency, ready to find out what task I had in mind. He came to a screeching halt when he saw Sonya get out of our car. So did she. They both stood frozen, eyes wider than seemed physically possible. I knew then that the rest of us had ceased to exist, as had all our intrigue, missions, and ... well, the world. In that moment, only the two of them existed.\n Sonya gave a strangled cry and then ran forward. This jolted him awake, in time to wrap her in his arms as she threw herself against him. She started crying, and I could see tears on his face too. He brushed her hair back and cupped her cheeks, staring down at her and repeating over and over, \"It\u0027s you ... it\u0027s you ... it\u0027s you ...\u0027\n Sonya tried to wipe her eyes, but it didn\u0027t do much good. \"Mikhail--I\u0027m sorry--I\u0027m so sorry--\u0027\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 He kissed her and pulled back only enough to look into her eyes. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. Nothing matters except that we\u0027re together again.\u0027\n This made her cry harder. She buried her face against his chest, and his arms tightened more fiercely around her. The rest of us stood as frozen as the lovers had been earlier. It felt wrong witnessing this. It was too private; we shouldn\u0027t have been there. Yet ... at the same time, I just kept thinking that this was how I\u0027d imagined my reunion with Dimitri would be when Lissa had restored him. Love. Forgiveness. Acceptance.\n Dimitri and I briefly locked eyes, and an uncanny sense told me he was recalling my words: You have to forgive yourself. If you can\u0027t, then you can\u0027t go on either. We can\u0027t. I glanced away from him, looking back at the happy couple so that he wouldn\u0027t see me tear up. God, I wanted what Mikhail and Sonya had. A happy ending. Forgiveness of the past. A bright future ahead.\n Jill sniffled beside me, and I put an arm around her. That small sound seemed to draw Mikhail back to our world. Still holding Sonya, he looked over at me.\n \"Thank you. Thank you for this. Anything you need. Anything at all--\u0027\n \"Stop, stop,\u0027 I said, afraid I might choke up. I\u0027d only just managed to blink away traitorous tears. \"I\u0027m glad ... glad to have done it, and well ... it wasn\u0027t really me at all.\u0027\n \"Still ...\u0027 Mikhail looked down at Sonya who was smiling at him through her tears. \"You\u0027ve given me my world back.\u0027\n \"I\u0027m so happy for you ... and I want you to have this, to just enjoy this right now. But I have a favor. One more favor.\u0027\n Sonya and Mikhail exchanged glances in a knowing way. You never would have guessed they\u0027d been apart for three years. She nodded, and he returned his gaze to me. \"I figured that\u0027s why he brought me here.\u0027 He inclined his head toward Adrian. \"I need you to get me into the hotel where the Alchemists are staying.\u0027\n The small smile on Mikhail\u0027s face dropped. \"Rose ... I can\u0027t get you into any place. You being this close to Court is dangerous enough.\u0027\n I pulled the bracelet from my pocket. \"I\u0027ll have a disguise. They won\u0027t know it\u0027s me. Is there a reason you\u0027d have to see the Alchemists?\u0027\n Sonya stayed in his arms, but his eyes were dark with thought. \"They\u0027ll have guardians near their rooms. We could probably pass ourselves off as relief.\u0027\n Dimitri nodded in agreement. \"If it\u0027s too different from their scheduled shift change, it\u0027ll raise eyebrows ... but hopefully you\u0027ll have long enough to get in and find out what you need. The guardians are probably more worried about the Alchemists getting out than other guardians getting in.\u0027\n \"Absolutely,\u0027 said Mikhail. \"So it\u0027s you and me, Rose?\u0027\n \"Yup,\u0027 I said. \"The fewer, the better. Just enough to question Sydney and Ian. I guess everyone else waits here.\u0027\n Sonya kissed his cheek. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere.\u0027\n Adrian had strolled over by now and given Jill a light, brotherly punch in the arm. \"And I\u0027m going to stay and hear how on earth you got involved with this, Jailbait.\u0027\n Jill mustered a smile for him. She had a pretty hardcore crush on him, and it was a sign of her stress that she didn\u0027t blush and go all weak-kneed. They started a conversation, and Dimitri gestured for me to follow him around the car, out of sight.\n \"This is dangerous,\u0027 he said quietly. \"If that charm fails, you probably aren\u0027t going to get out of that hotel.\u0027 There was an unspoken alive at the end of his words.\n \"It won\u0027t fail. Sonya\u0027s good. Besides, if we\u0027re caught, maybe they\u0027ll bring me back to Court instead of killing me. Imagine how much that will slow the elections.\u0027\n \"Rose, I\u0027m serious.\u0027\n I caught hold of his hand. \"I know, I know. This\u0027ll be easy. We should be in and out in under an hour, but if we aren\u0027t ...\u0027 Man, I hated grim contingencies. \"If we aren\u0027t, then send Adrian to Court with Jill, and you and Sonya hide out somewhere until ... I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \"Don\u0027t worry about us,\u0027 he said. \"You just be careful.\u0027 He leaned down and pressed a kiss to my forehead.\n \"Little dhampir, are you--\u0027\n Adrian came strolling around the car, just in time to see that small kiss. I dropped my hand from Dimitri\u0027s. None of us said anything, but in that moment, Adrian\u0027s eyes ... well, I saw his whole world come crashing apart. I felt sicker than if a fleet of Strigoi were around. I felt worse than a Strigoi. Honor, I thought. For real: the guardians should have taught it. Because I hadn\u0027t learned it.\n \"Let\u0027s hurry,\u0027 said Mikhail, walking over, oblivious to the drama that had just exploded beside him. \"Sonya says you guys have a ticking clock at Court too.\u0027\n I swallowed, dragging my eyes from Adrian. My heart twisted within my chest. \"Yeah ...\u0027\n \"Go,\u0027 said Dimitri.\n \"Remember,\u0027 I murmured to him. \"Talking to him is my responsibility. Not yours.\u0027 I followed Mikhail to his car, slipping on the charmed bracelet. Before getting inside, I cast a quick glance back. Jill and Sonya were speaking together, Dimitri stood alone, and Adrian was taking out a cigarette, his back to them all.\n \"I suck,\u0027 I said dismally, as Mikhail started the car. It was ineloquent but pretty much summed up my feelings.\n He didn\u0027t respond, probably because it wasn\u0027t relevant to our task. Either that, or he was still too wrapped up in the renewal of his own love life. Lucky bastard.\n It didn\u0027t take long to reach the hotel. There were guardians around, covertly placed so as not to draw human attention. None of them stopped us as we walked inside. One even gave Mikhail a nod of recognition. They all looked at me like ... well, like they didn\u0027t recognize me. Which was good. With so many guardians helping at Court, new faces were to be expected, and mine didn\u0027t look like Rose Hathaway\u0027s. No one was concerned.\n \"Which rooms are they in?\u0027 Mikhail asked a guardian who was standing in the lobby. \"We\u0027re supposed to relieve that shift.\u0027 Mikhail\u0027s manner was perfectly self-assured, enough that the guardian--while a little surprised--seemed to think this must be okay.\n \"Only two of you? There are four up there.\u0027\n I saved us on that one. \"They want more back at Court. Things are getting out of hand, so just two are being assigned here now.\u0027\n \"Probably all we need up there,\u0027 agreed the guardian. \"Third floor.\u0027\n \"Quick thinking,\u0027 Mikhail told me in the elevator.\n \"That was nothing. I\u0027ve talked myself out of much worse.\u0027\n The rooms were easy to spot because a guardian stood outside them. The rest are inside, I realized, wondering if that would be a problem. But, with that same authoritative attitude, Mikhail told the guy that he and the others had been recalled to Court. The guardian summoned his colleagues--one from each Alchemist\u0027s rooms, though we couldn\u0027t tell whose was whose--and they gave us a brief status report before leaving, including who was in which room.\n When they were gone, Mikhail looked to me. \"Sydney,\u0027 I said.\n We\u0027d been given key cards and walked right into Sydney\u0027s room. She sat cross- legged on her bed, reading a book and looking miserable. She sighed when she saw us.\n \"Well, what is it now?\u0027\n I took off the bracelet, letting my illusion vanish.\n There was no jaw dropping or raised eyebrows from Sydney. Just a knowing look. \"I should have guessed. Are you here to free me?\u0027 There was a hopeful note in her voice.\n \"Um, not exactly.\u0027 I hated that Sydney was going to get punished, but smuggling her out wasn\u0027t part of the plan now. \"We need to talk to Ian, and it\u0027s probably best if you\u0027re there. He knows something important. Something we need.\u0027\n That got the raised eyebrow. She pointed at the door. \"They won\u0027t let us talk to each other.\u0027\n \"They aren\u0027t out there,\u0027 I said smugly.\n Sydney shook her head ruefully. \"Rose, you really do scare me sometimes. Just not for the reasons I originally thought you would. Come on. He\u0027s next door, but you\u0027ll have a hard time getting him to talk.\u0027 \"That\u0027s where you\u0027ll help,\u0027 I said, as we walked into the hall. I slipped the bracelet back on. \"He\u0027s totally into you. He\u0027ll help if you ask.\u0027\n As I\u0027d guessed, Sydney was completely oblivious to Ian\u0027s crush. \"What! He does not-- \u0027\n She shut her mouth as we entered Ian\u0027s room. He was watching TV but jumped up when he saw us. \"Sydney! Are you okay?\u0027\n I shot her a meaningful look.\n She gave me a pained one in return and then turned her attention back to Ian. \"They need your help with something. Some information.\u0027\n He turned his gaze on us, and it immediately went colder. \"We answered your questions a hundred times.\u0027\n \"Not all of them,\u0027 I said. \"When you were at Court, you saw a picture on the table. Of a dead man. Who was it?\u0027\n Ian\u0027s lips went into a straight line. \"I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \"I saw--er, that is, we know you recognized him,\u0027 I argued. \"You reacted.\u0027\n \"I actually saw that too,\u0027 admitted Sydney.\n His tone turned pleading. \"Come on, we don\u0027t need to help them anymore. This whole hotel-prison thing is bad enough. I\u0027m sick of their games.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t blame him, really, but we needed him too much. I glanced at Sydney beseechingly, telling her that only she could get us through this.\n She turned back to Ian. \"What\u0027s the deal with the guy in the picture? Is it ... is it really horrible? Something secret?\u0027\n He shrugged. \"No. I just don\u0027t want to help them anymore. It\u0027s irrelevant.\u0027\n \"Will you do it for me?\u0027 she asked sweetly. \"Please? It might help me get out of trouble.\u0027 Sydney was no master of flirting, but I think just the fact she came close to it astonished him. He hesitated for several moments, glanced at us and then back to her. She smiled at him.\n Ian caved. \"I meant what I said. I don\u0027t know who he is. He was with a Moroi woman over in the St. Louis facility one day.\u0027\n \"Wait,\u0027 I said, derailed. \"Moroi come to your places?\u0027\n \"Sometimes,\u0027 said Sydney. \"Just like we came to yours. Some meetings happen in person. We don\u0027t usually hold your people prisoner, though.\u0027\n \"I think this guy was like her bodyguard or something,\u0027 Ian said. \"She was the one there on business. He just followed and stayed quiet.\u0027\n \"A Moroi bodyguard?\u0027\n \"Not uncommon for those that can\u0027t get guardians,\u0027 said Mikhail. \"Abe Mazur is proof of that. He\u0027s got his own army.\u0027\n \"I think of them more as a mafia.\u0027 My joke aside, I was getting confused. Despite the widespread disdain about learning to fight, sometimes Moroi did have to hire Moroi security because they just couldn\u0027t obtain a guardian. Someone like Daniella Ivashkov wouldn\u0027t have that problem. In fact, I was pretty sure she\u0027d be entitled to two guardians if she stepped outside protective borders--and she\u0027d made it clear she didn\u0027t think Moroi should fight. Why would she travel with Moroi protection when she could have better trained guardians? It made no sense. Still ... if you\u0027d killed a queen, you probably did all sorts of unorthodox things. They didn\u0027t have to make sense. \"Who was she?\u0027 I asked. \"The woman?\u0027\n \"I didn\u0027t know her either,\u0027 said Ian. \"I just passed them while they were on their way to something. A meeting, maybe.\u0027\n \"Do you remember what she looked like?\u0027 Something. We needed something. This was on the verge of falling apart, but if Ian could identify Daniella, we might just be set.\n \"Sure,\u0027 he said. \"She\u0027s easy to remember.\u0027\n The ensuing silence irritated me. \"So?\u0027 I asked. \"What did she look like?\u0027\n He told me.\n The description was not what I had expected. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-31.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
