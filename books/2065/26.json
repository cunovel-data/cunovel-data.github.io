{"id":110940,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"SHE\u0027S WHAT?\u0027 I EXCLAIMED. The dream birds singing in the garden fell silent. \"With them? Is that why they called the guardians?\u0027\n Sonya\u0027s calmness continued, but she frowned slightly. \"Victor and Robert didn\u0027t call the guardians. Why would they?\u0027 \"Because ... because they wanted to get rid of Dimitri and me ...\u0027\n \"Perhaps,\u0027 said Sonya. \"But not while they were still in the house. Victor\u0027s as wanted as you are. It was only Robert\u0027s magic that got them out.\u0027\n \"Then who ...\u0027 The answer hit me. I groaned. \"John and Emily. I should have known it wouldn\u0027t be that easy. They were too quick to accept fugitives into their house.\u0027\n \"I actually think it was just John. Emily really did seem to believe you were innocent ... even if she didn\u0027t like why you were there. I also suspect she\u0027d worry calling guardians would just draw more attention to Jill\u0027s identity. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me if John didn\u0027t even warn her about calling them. He probably thought he was doing everyone a favor.\u0027\n \"And instead, he lost his stepdaughter,\u0027 I said. \"But why would Victor and Robert take her? And how the hell did two old men subdue a teenage girl anyway?\u0027\n Sonya shrugged. \"They\u0027re probably stronger than they seem. Compulsion also likely played a role. And as for why? Hard to say. But Victor wants power and control. Keeping the missing Dragomir with him is a good way to possess that.\u0027\n I slumped against a tree. \"We\u0027ll never get her to Court.\u0027\n \"We just have to find her,\u0027 said Sonya. \"Which I should be able to do once she\u0027s asleep.\u0027\n \"More dream-walking,\u0027 I said. My hope began to rekindle. \"You should go to her now. Find out--\u0027\n \"I\u0027ve tried. She\u0027s not asleep. And I\u0027m willing to bet they\u0027re keeping her awake for that very reason so they can put some distance between us. I\u0027ll keep trying, though.\u0027\n It wasn\u0027t ideal but was the best we could hope for right now. \"And Sydney and the Mastranos?\u0027\n \"Facing a lot of questions.\u0027 Sonya\u0027s face fell. I knew she still felt bad about abandoning her cousin, just as I felt bad about Sydney.\n I gently touched Sonya\u0027s arm. \"It\u0027s okay. They\u0027ll be okay. What you did will help Jill.\u0027\n She nodded. \"How are we going to stay in touch? I can\u0027t always wait for you to be asleep.\u0027\n Silence. Excellent point.\n \"Maybe we could get a cell phone today ... God knows we\u0027ve needed one. And well ... why don\u0027t you just come to us? Where are you anyway?\u0027\n I wondered if I was making a mistake in inviting her to join us. Dimitri and I had gone to great pains to keep our location secret, and that run-in with the guardians had already been a bit closer than I would have liked. Aside from the obvious problems-- imprisonment, execution, et cetera--being captured would take us out of the picture for helping Lissa. Yet, I was pretty sure Sonya was one of our allies, and at this point, she might be our only link to Jill.\n I\u0027d made a similar gamble in revealing where we were to Victor. And while he had technically helped us, that help had obviously backfired. Nonetheless, I told Sonya the name of our campground and the best directions I could. She said she\u0027d come--I didn\u0027t know how she\u0027d manage it but suspected she was resourceful--and would keep trying to reach Jill.\n \"Sonya ...\u0027 I hesitated to speak, knowing I should just let her end the dream. We had important problems, more serious than what I was about to ask. Plus, this was personal territory. \"What did you mean in the car ... when I said I\u0027d shared a dream with my boyfriend? You looked surprised.\u0027\n Sonya studied me for a long moment, those blue eyes looking deeper into me than I would have liked. Sometimes she seemed safer in crazy mode. \"Auras tell a lot, Rose, and I\u0027m very good at reading them. Much better than your friends probably are. A spirit dream wraps your own aura in gold, which is how I knew. Your personal aura is unique to you, though it fluctuates with your feelings and soul. When people are in love, it shows. Their auras shine. When you were dreaming, yours was bright. The colors were bright ... but not what I expected from a boyfriend. Of course, not every relationship is the same. People are at different stages. I would have brushed it off, except ...\u0027\n \"Except what?\u0027\n \"Except, when you\u0027re with Dimitri, your aura\u0027s like the sun. So is his.\u0027 She smiled when I simply stared in stunned silence. \"You\u0027re surprised by this?\u0027\n \"I ... that is, we\u0027re over. We used to be together, but after his change, he didn\u0027t want me anymore. I moved on.\u0027 Where moving on apparently meant holding hands and having close, heated moments. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m with Adrian. I\u0027m happy with Adrian.\u0027 That last sentence sounded almost defensive. Who was I trying to convince? Her or myself?\n \"Behaviors and feelings rarely line up,\u0027 she said, sounding very Dimitri Zen-like. \"Don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but you\u0027ve got some issues to work out.\u0027\n Great. Therapy from a crazy woman. \"Okay, let\u0027s suppose there\u0027s something to this. I only really gave up on Dimitri a couple weeks ago. It\u0027s possible I\u0027m probably still holding onto some feelings.\u0027 Possible? I thought about how acutely aware of his physical presence I always was in the car, the carefree harmony in the library, how good it felt to work with him in that way of ours, both so determined and almost never second- guessing the other. And only hours ago, in the guestroom ...\n Sonya had the audacity to laugh. \"Possible? After only two weeks? Rose, you\u0027re wise in so many ways ... and so young in others.\u0027\n I hated being judged by my age but had no time for temper tantrums. \"Okay, whatever. I\u0027ve still got feelings. But not him. You didn\u0027t see him after he was changed. It was horrible. He was depressed. He said he wanted to avoid me at all costs, that he couldn\u0027t love anyone again. It wasn\u0027t until this escape madness that he even started acting like his old self.\u0027\n \"He and I talked about that,\u0027 she said, face serious again. \"About the depression. I understand it. After being Strigoi ... doing what we did ... you don\u0027t feel worthy of life. There\u0027s just guilt and darkness and the crushing memories of that evil.\u0027 She shuddered.\n \"You ... you\u0027ve acted differently from him. I mean, you look so sad sometimes, but at others ... it\u0027s like nothing happened. You\u0027re already back to your old self. Mostly. Why the difference in you two?\u0027\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve still got the guilt, believe me. After Robert changed me ...\u0027 There was venom when she spoke his name. \"Well, I didn\u0027t want to leave my house, my bed. I hated myself for what I\u0027d done. I wished I\u0027d been staked to death. Then Dimitri talked to me... . He said that guilt was inevitable. The fact that I can feel it proves I\u0027m not Strigoi. But he told me I can\u0027t let that stop me from embracing life again. We\u0027ve been given second chances, he and I. We can\u0027t throw them away. He also said it took him a while to realize it and that he didn\u0027t want me to make the same mistakes. He told me to embrace life and its beauty and the people I love before it was too late--even though it\u0027d be difficult. Shaking that Strigoi past ... it\u0027s like a weight, always pressing on me. He swore he wasn\u0027t going to let it control him anymore--which, believe me, sounds noble but is very hard to do--and that he wouldn\u0027t let his life be pointless. He\u0027d already lost some things forever but refused to let go of the rest.\u0027\n \"He said all that? I ... I\u0027m not even sure what half of it means.\u0027 He told me to embrace life and its beauty and the people I love before it was too late.\n \"Sometimes I don\u0027t either. Like I said, it\u0027s much easier said than done. Still, I think he has helped me recover more quickly than I would have on my own. I\u0027m grateful. And as for you and your auras ...\u0027 That small smile returned. \"Well, you\u0027ve got to figure it out. I don\u0027t believe in soul mates, not exactly. I think it\u0027s ridiculous to think there\u0027s only one person out there for us. What if your \"soul mate\u0027 lives in Zimbabwe? What if he dies young? I also think \"two souls becoming one\u0027 is ridiculous. You need to hold onto yourself. But I do believe in souls being in sync, souls that mirror each other. I see that synchronicity in auras. I can see love too. And I see all of that in his aura and in yours. Only you can choose what to do with that information--if you even believe it.\u0027\n \"No pressure,\u0027 I muttered.\n She looked like she was about to end the dream but then stopped and gave me a piercing look. \"One thing to be careful of, Rose. Your auras match, but they aren\u0027t identical. Dimitri\u0027s is spiked with bits of darkness, leftover from his trauma. That darkness fades a little each day. You carry darkness too--but it\u0027s not fading.\u0027\n I shivered. \"Lissa. It\u0027s the darkness I\u0027m taking from her, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \"Yes. I don\u0027t know much about bonds, but what you\u0027re doing--even if it\u0027s helping her--is very dangerous. Spirit tears us apart, no question, but in some ways ... I think we spirit users are built for it a little better. Not that it\u0027s always obvious,\u0027 she added wryly. \"But you? No. And if you take too much, I don\u0027t know what\u0027ll happen. I\u0027m afraid of it building and building. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s just going to take one spark--one catalyst--to make it explode inside you.\u0027\n \"What happens then?\u0027 I whispered.\n She shook her head slowly. \"I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n With that, the dream faded.\n I fell back into dreamless sleep, though my body--as if knowing it was time to take my shift--woke on its own a few hours later. Night\u0027s blackness surrounded me once more, and nearby, I could hear Dimitri\u0027s even, steady breathing and sense his warmth. Everything I\u0027d just discussed with Sonya came pouring back to me. Too much, too much. I didn\u0027t know where to begin processing it. And no, I didn\u0027t know if I could believe it, not with what I\u0027d seen in real life. Behaviors and feelings rarely line up. With a deep breath, I forced myself to be a guardian, not an emotionally distraught girl.\n \"Your time for sleep, comrade.\u0027\n His voice came to me like light in the darkness, soft and low. \"You can get more rest if you need it.\u0027\n \"No, I\u0027m fine,\u0027 I told him. \"And remember, you\u0027re not--\u0027\n \"I know, I know,\u0027 he chuckled. \"I\u0027m not the general.\u0027 Oh lord. We finished each other\u0027s jokes. I do believe in souls that are in sync. Sternly reminding myself that Sonya\u0027s visit hadn\u0027t actually been about my love life, I recounted the rest of the dream to Dimitri, describing John\u0027s betrayal and Jill\u0027s abduction. \"Did I ... did I do the right thing telling Sonya where we are?\u0027\n Several moments passed before he replied. \"Yes. You\u0027re right that we need her help--and she can find Jill. The problem is, Victor and Robert have to know that too.\u0027 He sighed. \"And you\u0027re right that I\u0027d better rest up for what\u0027s to come.\u0027\n So, in that efficient way of his, he said no more. Soon, his breathing shifted as he fell back into sleep. It was amazing how he could do that with so little effort. Of course, that was something we\u0027d been taught as guardians: sleep when you can because you don\u0027t know when you\u0027ll be able to again. It was a trick I\u0027d never picked up. Staring into the darkness, I kept my senses sharp, listening for any sounds that might indicate danger.\n I might not have a talent for falling asleep instantly, but I could keep my waking body alert while still checking in with Lissa. Jill and our escape had occupied me today, but events at Court still weighed heavily on me. Someone had tried to kill Lissa, and a group of guardians had just dragged off Eddie.\n When I looked through her eyes, it was no surprise that I found most of my friends together. They were in a stark, intimidating room similar to the one she\u0027d been questioned in about my escape--except it was larger. And with good reason. It was packed with all sorts of people. Adrian and Christian stood by Lissa, and I needed no aura reading to know the two guys were as uneasy as she was. Hans stood behind a table, hands pressed on it as he leaned forward and glared at everyone. Opposite Lissa, against the far wall, Eddie sat stone-faced in a chair with a guardian on either side of him. Both of his guards were tense, braced to leap into action. They thought Eddie was a threat, I realized, which was ridiculous. Yet, Hans seemed to share their opinion.\n He jabbed his finger at a photograph lying on the table. Taking a step forward, Lissa saw that the picture was of the guy who\u0027d attacked her--a picture taken after his death. His eyes were closed, his skin gone pale--but it provided a detailed look at his facial features, bland as they were.\n \"You killed a Moroi!\u0027 exclaimed Hans. I\u0027d apparently tuned in to the middle of the conversation. \"How is that not a problem? You\u0027re trained to protect them!\u0027\n \"I did,\u0027 said Eddie. He was so calm, so serious that the part of me that could still muster a sense of humor thought he was like Dimitri Junior. \"I protected her. What difference does it make if the threat\u0027s Moroi or Strigoi?\u0027\n \"We have no proof of any of the details of this attack,\u0027 growled Hans.\n \"You have three witnesses!\u0027 snapped Christian. \"Are you saying our reports are worthless?\u0027\n \"I\u0027m saying you\u0027re his friends, which makes your reports questionable. I would have liked to have had a guardian around to verify this.\u0027\n Now Lissa\u0027s temper flared. \"You did! Eddie was there.\u0027\n \"And there was no way you could have protected her without killing him?\u0027 asked Hans.\n Eddie didn\u0027t answer, and I knew he was seriously considering the question, wondering if he might truly have made a mistake. At last, he shook his head. \"If I hadn\u0027t killed him, he would have killed me.\u0027 Hans sighed, his eyes weary. It was easy for me to be angry at him right now, and I had to remind myself he was just doing his job. He held up the picture. \"And none of you--none of you--have ever seen this man?\u0027\n Lissa studied the face once more, repressing a shiver. No, she hadn\u0027t recognized him during the attack and didn\u0027t recognize him now. There was really nothing remarkable about him--no notable feature you could point out. Our other friends shook their heads, but Lissa felt herself frowning.\n \"Yes?\u0027 asked Hans, immediately jumping on that subtle shift.\n \"I don\u0027t know him ...\u0027 she said slowly. The conversation with Joe the janitor popped into her mind.\n \"What\u0027d the guy look like?\u0027 she\u0027d asked Joe.\n \"Plain. Ordinary. Except the hand.\u0027\n Lissa stared at the picture a moment longer, which just barely showed a scarred hand with a couple of bent fingers. I had also noticed it in the fight. She lifted her eyes to Hans. \"I don\u0027t know him,\u0027 she repeated. \"But I think I know someone who does. There\u0027s a janitor ... well, a former janitor. The one who testified about Rose. I think he\u0027s seen this guy before. They have an interesting business relationship. Mikhail was going to make sure he didn\u0027t leave Court.\u0027\n Adrian did not look happy at all about having Joe brought up, seeing as it implicated his mother for bribery. \"They\u0027ll have a hard time making him talk.\u0027\n Hans narrowed his eyes. \"Oh, if he knows something, we\u0027ll make him talk.\u0027 He gave a sharp nod toward the door, and one of the guardians by Eddie moved toward it. \"Find this guy. And send in our \"guests.\u0027\u0027 The guardian nodded and left the room.\n \"What guests?\u0027 asked Lissa.\n \"Well,\u0027 said Hans, \"it\u0027s funny you mention Hathaway. Because we just had a sighting of her.\u0027\n Lissa stiffened, panic flashing through her. They found Rose. But how? Abe had assured her I was safe in that town in West Virginia.\n \"She and Belikov were spotted outside of Detroit, where they kidnapped a girl.\u0027\n \"They\u0027d never--\u0027 Lissa stopped. \"Did you say Detroit?\u0027 It was with great restraint that she didn\u0027t shoot questioning looks at Christian and Adrian.\n Hans nodded, and although he gave the appearance of just passing on information, I knew he was watching for some sort of telling reaction from my friends. \"They had a few other people with them. Some of them got away, but we caught one.\u0027\n \"Who did they kidnap?\u0027 asked Christian. His astonishment wasn\u0027t faked either. He too had thought we were safely stashed.\n \"Mastrano,\u0027 said Hans. \"Something Mastrano.\u0027\n \"Jill Mastrano?\u0027 exclaimed Lissa.\n \"Jailbait?\u0027 asked Adrian.\n Hans clearly wasn\u0027t up to date on this nickname but didn\u0027t have a chance to question it because just then, the door opened. Three guardians entered, and with them was-- Sydney. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-26.html","bookId":2065,"book":{"id":2065,"title":"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 6: Last Sacrifice \n Rose is in prison after being framed for Queen Tatiana\u0027s murder.
