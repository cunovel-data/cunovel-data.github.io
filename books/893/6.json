{"id":12680,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI.","content":"On inquiry of the concierge at No. 15 Avenue de Passy, Cuthbert was informed that Madame Michaud lived on the third floor. On ascending and ringing the bell the door was opened by an elderly servant. \"I have called to see Mademoiselle Brander, is she at home?\" \"She is, sir.\" \"Would you give her my card, if you please?\"[Pg 72] \"Mademoiselle is expecting you,\" the servant said, and led the way at once into a sitting-room. It was of the usual type of such room—of good size but bare, with bee\u0027s-waxed flooring, plainly frescoed walls, and a ceiling colored gray and bordered with painted arabesques. Two or three small rugs relieved the bareness of the floor. An oval table on very thin legs stood in the middle; the chairs and couch seemed to have been made to match it, and had an eminently bare and uncomfortable appearance; a vase of flowers stood on a spindle-legged little table in front of one of the windows which opened down to the ground. Some colored prints in frames of stained wood hung on the walls, and some skimpy curtains draped the windows. Mary Brander was seated with a writing-pad on her knee at the window unoccupied by the vase and its support. She put the writing-pad and a book, evidently a large diary, down on the floor. \"You are punctual to the minute, Mr. Hartington. I should never have credited you with that virtue.\" \"Nor with any other virtue, I imagine, Miss Brander,\" he said, with a smile. \"Oh, yes, I do. I credit you with numbers of them. Now draw that chair up to the window—it is not comfortable, but it is the best of them—and let us talk. Now, in the first place you don\u0027t know how sorry, how dreadfully sorry I have been about what has happened at home. I was shocked, indeed, at the news of the sudden death of your dear father. He was always so kind when he came to see us, and I liked him so much, I felt for you deeply. It must have been an awful shock for you. I heard it a few days after I got to Dresden. Then came the other news about that terrible failure and its consequences. It seemed too shocking altogether that you should have lost the dear old place, but I do think I was most shocked of all when I heard that my father had bought it. Somehow it did not seem to be right. Of course it must have been, but it did not seem so to me. Did it to you, Cuthbert?\" and she looked at him wistfully.[Pg 73] \"I have no doubt it was all right,\" he said, \"and as it was to be sold, I think I preferred it should be to your father rather than anybody else. I believe I rather liked the thought that as it was not to be my home it would be yours.\" She shook her head. \"It does not seem to me to be natural at all, and I was miserable all the time I was there the other day.\" \"Your father respected my wishes in all respects, Mary. I believe he kept on all the old servants who chose to stay. He promised me that he would not sell my father\u0027s hunters, and that no one should ride them, but that they should be pensioners as long as they lived; and the same with the dogs, and that at any time, if I moved into quarters where I could keep a dog or two, he would send up my two favorites to me.\" \"Yes, they are all there. I went out and gave cakes to the dogs and sugar to the horses every day, and talked to them, and I think regularly had a cry over them. It was very foolish, but I could not help it. It did all seem so wrong and so pitiful. I could not learn much about you from father. He said that you had only written once to him on business since things were finally settled; but that you had mentioned that you were going to Paris, and he said, too—\" and she hesitated for a moment, \"that although you had lost Fairclose and all the property, you had enough to live upon in a way—a very poor way—but still enough for that.\" \"Not such a very poor way,\" he said. \"There is no secret about it. I had five thousand pounds that had been settled on my mother, and fortunately that was not affected by the smash, so I have two hundred a year, which is amply sufficient for my wants.\" \"It is enough, of course, to live upon in a way, Cuthbert, but so different from what you were accustomed to.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose you spend two hundred a year,\" he said, with a smile. \"Oh, no, but a woman is so different. That is just what I have, and of course I don\u0027t spend anything like all of it; but[Pg 74] as I said, it is so different with you, who have been accustomed to spend ever so much more.\" \"I don\u0027t find myself in any way pinched. I can assure you my lodgings in the Quartier Latin are not what you would call sumptuous, but they are comfortable enough, and they do not stand me in a quarter of what I paid for my chambers in London. I can dine sumptuously on a franc and a half. Another franc covers my breakfast, which is generally café au lait and two eggs; another franc suffices for supper. So you see that my necessaries of life, including lodgings and fuel, do not come to anything like half my income, and I can spend the rest in riotous living if I choose.\" The girl looked at him earnestly. \"You are not growing cynical, I hope, Cuthbert?\" \"I hope not. I am certainly not conscious of it. I don\u0027t look cynical, do I?\" \"No,\" she said, doubtfully. \"I do not see any change in you, but what do you do with yourself?\" \"I paint,\" he said. \"Really!\" \"Really and truly, I have become what you wanted me to become, a very earnest person indeed, and some day people may even take to buying my pictures.\" \"I never quite know when you are in earnest, Cuthbert; but if it is true it is very good news. Do you mean that you are really studying?\" \"I am indeed. I work at the studio of one M. Goudé, and if you choose to inquire, you will find he is perhaps the best master in Paris. I am afraid the Prussians are going to interrupt my studies a good deal. This has made me angry and I have enlisted—that is to say, been sworn in as a member of the Chasseurs des écoles, which most of the students at Goudé\u0027s have joined.\" \"What! You are going to fight against the Germans!\" she exclaimed, indignantly. \"You never can mean it, Cuthbert.\" \"I mean it, I can assure you,\" he said, amused at her indig[Pg 75]nation. \"I suppose you are almost Germanized, and regard their war against the French as a just and holy cause.\" \"Certainly I do,\" she said, \"though of course, I should not say so here. I am in France and living in a French family, and naturally I would say nothing that would hurt the feelings of the people round me, but there can be no doubt that the French deserve all the misfortunes that have fallen upon them. They would have invaded Germany, and all these poor young Germans have been torn away from their friends and families to fight.\" \"So have these young Frenchmen. To my mind the war was deliberately forced upon France, but I think we had better agree to differ on this subject. You have been among Germans and it is not unnatural that you should have accepted their version. I have been living among Frenchmen, and although I do not say that it would not have been much wiser if they had avoided falling into the pit dug for them, my sympathies are wholly with them, except in this outburst of folly that has resulted in the establishment, for a time at any rate, of a Republic. Now, I have no sympathy whatever with Republics, still less for a Republic controlled by political adventurers, and like many Frenchmen I am going to fight for France, and in no way for the Republic. At any rate let us agree to avoid the subject altogether. We shall never convince each other however much we might argue it over.\" The girl was silent for two or three minutes, and then said— \"Well, we will agree not to quarrel over it. I don\u0027t know how it is that we always see things so differently, Cuthbert. However, we may talk about your doings without arguing over the cause. Of course you do not suppose there will be much fighting—a week or two will see the end of it all.\" \"Again we differ,\" he said. \"I believe that there will be some sharp fighting, and I believe that Paris will hold out for months.\" She looked at him incredulously. \"I should have thought,\" she said, after a pause, \"you were the last person who would take this noisy shouting mob seriously.\"[Pg 76] \"I don\u0027t think anything of the mob one way or the other,\" he said. \"I despise them utterly; but the troops and the mobiles are sufficient to man the forts and the walls, and I believe that middle-class corps, like the one I have entered, will fight manfully; and the history of Paris has shown over and over again that the mob of Paris, fickle, vain-headed, noisy braggadocios as they are, and always have been, can at least starve well. They held out against Henry of Navarre till numbers dropped dead in the streets, and until the Spaniards came at last from the Netherlands and raised the siege, and I believe they will hold out now. They have courage enough, as has been shown over and over again at the barricades, but they will be useless for fighting because they will submit to no discipline. Still, as I said, they can starve, and it will be a long time indeed before the suffering will become intense enough to drive them to surrender. I fear that you have altogether underrated the gravity of the situation, and that you will have very severe privations to go through before the siege is over.\" \"I suppose I can stand it as well as others,\" she laughed, \"but I think you are altogether wrong. However, if it should come it will be very interesting.\" \"Very,\" he said, shortly, \"but I doubt if you will see it quite in the same light when it comes to eating rats.\" \"I should not eat them,\" she said, decidedly. \"Well, when it comes to that or nothing, I own that I myself shall eat rats if I can get them. I have heard that the country rat, the fellow that lives in ricks, is by no means bad eating, but I own to having a doubt as to the Paris rat.\" \"It is disgusting to think of such a thing,\" she said, indignantly, \"the idea is altogether ridiculous.\" \"I do not know whether you consider that betting is among the things that woman has as much right to do as man; but if you do, I am ready to wager it will come to rats before Paris surrenders.\" \"I never made a bet in my life,\" she said, \"but I will wager five francs with you that there will be nothing of the sort. I do not say that rats may not be eaten in the poor quarters. I do[Pg 77] not know what they eat there. I hear they eat horse-flesh, and for anything I know they may eat rats; but I will wager that rats will never be openly sold as an article of food before Paris surrenders.\" \"It is a bet,\" he said, \"and I will book it at once,\" and he gravely took out a pocket-book and made an entry. \"And now,\" he said, as he replaced the book in his pocket, \"how do you pass your time?\" \"I spend some hours every day at the Bibliothêque. Then I take a walk in this quarter and all round the Boulevards. One can walk just as freely there as one could in Germany, but I find that I cannot venture off them into the poorer quarters; the people stare, and it is not pleasant.\" \"I certainly should not recommend you to make experiments that way. In the great thoroughfares a lady walking by herself passes unnoticed, especially if she looks English or American. They are coming to understand that young women in those countries are permitted an amount of freedom that is shocking to the French mind, but the idea has not permeated to the lower strata of society. \"If you are really desirous of investigating the ways of the female population of the poorer quarters, I shall be happy to escort you whenever you like, but I do not think you will be altogether gratified with the result of your researches, and I think that you would obtain a much closer insight into French lower class life by studying Balzac and some of the modern writers—they are not always savory, but at least they are realistic.\" \"Balzac is terrible,\" she said, \"and some of the others I have read a little of are detestable. I don\u0027t think you can be serious in advising me to read them.\" \"I certainly should not advise you to read any of them, Miss Brander, if you were a young lady of the ordinary type; but as you take up the cause of woman in general it is distinctly necessary that you should study all the phases of female life. How else can you grapple with the question?\" \"You are laughing at me again, Mr. Hartington,\" she said, somewhat indignantly.[Pg 78] \"I can assure you that I am not. If your crusade is in favor only of girls of the upper and middle classes, you are touching but the fringe of the subject, for they are outnumbered by twenty to one by those of other classes, and those in far greater need of higher life than the others.\" \"It seems rather hopeless,\" Mary Brander said, despondently, after a pause, \"one is so unable to influence them.\" \"Exactly so. You are setting yourself to move a mountain. When the time comes there may be an upheaval, and the mountain may move of its own accord; but the efforts of a thousand or ten thousand women as earnest as yourself would be no more use in proportion, than those of a colony of ants working to level the mountain.\" \"Don\u0027t discourage me, Cuthbert,\" she said, pitifully. \"I do believe with all my heart in my principles, but I do often feel discouraged. The task seems to grow larger and more difficult the more I see of it, and I own that living a year among German women was rather crushing to me.\" \"That I can quite understand,\" he said, with a smile, \"the average German woman differs as widely in her ideas—I do not say aspirations, for she has none—from your little group of theorists at Girton as the poles are apart.\" \"But do not think,\" she replied, rallying, \"that I am in the least shaken because I see that the difficulty is greater than I have looked for. Your simile of ants is not correct. Great things can be done by individuals. Voltaire and Rousseau revolutionized French thought from the top to the bottom. Why should not a great woman some day rise and exercise as great influence over her sex as these two Frenchmen did? But do not let us talk about that any more. I want to hear more about what you are doing. I have thought of you so much during the past year—it has all seemed so strange and so sad. Are you really working hard—I mean steadily and regularly?\" \"You evidently think that impossible,\" he laughed, \"but I can assure you it is true. If you doubt me I will give you Goudé\u0027s address, and if you call upon him and say that you have an interest in me—you can assign any reason you like, say that you[Pg 79] are an aunt of mine and intend to make me your heir—and beg him to inform you frankly of his opinion of my work and progress, I feel sure that he will give you an account that will satisfy your doubts.\" \"I don\u0027t think I could do that,\" she said, seriously. \"There, you are laughing at me again,\" she broke off as she looked up at him. \"Of course I could not do such a thing, but I should very greatly like to know about you.\" \"I do think, Miss Brander, I am working hard enough and steady enough to satisfy even you. I did so for six months in England with a fellow named Terrier. He was just the master I wanted. He had not a shadow of imagination, but was up in all the technical details of painting, and in six months\u0027 hard work I really learnt to paint; previous to that I knew nothing of painting. I could make a colored sketch, but that was all, now I am on the highway to becoming an artist. Goudé will only receive pupils whom he considers likely to do him credit, and on seeing two of the things I had done after I had been working with Terrier, he accepted me at once. He is a splendid master—out and away the best in Paris, and is really a great artist himself. He is a peppery little man and will tolerate no nonsense, and I can assure you that he is well satisfied with me. I am going to set to work to do a couple of pictures on my own account for next year\u0027s Salon. I should have waited another year before trying my wings, if he had not encouraged me to venture at once, and as he is very much opposed to his pupils painting for exhibition until they are sufficiently advanced to begin with a success, it is proof that he has at least some hopes of me.\" \"I am glad indeed, Cuthbert. I shan\u0027t be quite so sorry now as I have been about your losing Fairclose. It is so much nobler to work than it is to fritter away a life doing nothing. How tiresome it is,\" she said, \"that you have taken this unfortunate idea in your head of joining a French corps. It will unsettle you altogether.\" \"Really,\" he broke in with a laugh, \"I must protest against being considered so weak and unstable. You had a perfect right[Pg 80] in thinking me lazy, but I don\u0027t think you have any right in considering me a reed to be shaken by every passing wind. I can assure you that I am very fixed in my resolves. I was content to be lazy before simply because there was no particular reason for my being otherwise, and I admit that constitutionally I may incline that way; but when a cataclysm occurred, and, as I may say, the foundations were shaken, it became necessary for me to work, and I took a resolution to do so, and have stuck to it. Possibly I should have done so in any case. You see when a man is told by a young lady he is a useless idler, who does but cumber the earth, it wakes him up a little.\" \"I am sure I didn\u0027t say that,\" Mary said, indignantly, but with a hot flush on her cheeks. \"Not in those precise words, but you spoke to that effect, and my conscience told me you were not far wrong in your opinion. I had begun to meditate whether I ought not to turn over a new leaf when I came in suddenly for Fairclose; that of course seemed to knock it all on the head. Then came what we may call the smash. This was so manifestly an interposition of Providence in the direction of my bestirring myself that I took the heroic resolution to work.\" Mary felt that it was desirable to avoid continuing the subject. She had long since come to regard that interview in the garden as a sort of temporary aberration on his part, and that although, perhaps, sincere at the moment, he had very speedily come to laugh at his own folly, and had recognized that the idea was altogether ridiculous. Upon her it had made so little impression that it had scarcely occurred to her when they met, that any passage of the sort had taken place, and had welcomed him as the lad she had known as a child, rather than as the man who had, under a passing impulse, asked her to marry him. \"I think,\" she said suddenly, \"I will fetch Madame Michaud in. It will be nice for you to come here in the evening sometimes, and it would be better for her to ask you to do so than for me. These French people have such funny ideas.\" \"It would certainly be more pleasant,\" he agreed, \"and even[Pg 81]ing will be the time that I have most leisure—that is to say, when we do not happen to be on duty, as to which I am very vague at present. They say the sailors will garrison the forts and the army take the outpost duty; but I fancy, when the Germans really surround us, it will be necessary to keep so strong a force outside the walls, that they will have to call out some of us in addition. The arrangement at present is, we are to drill in the morning and we shall paint in the afternoon; so the evening will be the only time when we shall be free.\" \"What do you do in the evening generally? You must find it very lonely.\" \"Not at all. I have an American who is in our school, and who lodges in the same house as I do. Then there are the students, a light-hearted, merry set of young fellows. We have little supper-parties and go to each other\u0027s rooms to chatter and smoke. Then, occasionally, I drop into the theatre. It is very much like the life I had in London, only a good deal more lively and amusing, and with a great deal less luxury and a very much smaller expenditure; and—this is very serious I can assure you—very much worse tobacco.\" The girl laughed merrily. \"What will you do about smoking when you are reduced to the extremity you prophesy?\" \"That point is, I confess, troubling me seriously. I look forward with very much greater dread to the prospect of having to smoke dried leaves and the sweepings of tobacco warehouses, than I do to the eating of rats. I have been making inquiries of all sorts as to the state of the stock of tobacco, and I intend this evening to invest five pounds in laying in a store; and mean to take up a plank and hide it under the floor, and to maintain the most profound secrecy as to its existence. There is no saying whether, as time goes on, it may not be declared an offence of the gravest character for any one to have a private store of any necessary. If you have any special weaknesses, such as chocolate or tea, or anything of that sort, I should advise you not to lose a moment in laying in a good stock. You will see in another week, when people begin to[Pg 82] recognize generally what a siege means, that everything eatable will double in price, and in a month only millionaires will be able to purchase them.\" \"I really will buy some tea and chocolate,\" she said. \"Get in a good stock,\" he said. \"Especially of chocolate. I am quite serious, I can assure you. Unfortunately, you have no place for keeping a sheep or two, or a bullock; and bread, at the end of a couple of months, could scarcely be eaten; but, really, I should advise you to invest in a dozen of those big square boxes of biscuits, and a ham or two may come in as a welcome addition some day.\" Mary laughed incredulously, but she was much more inclined than before to look at matters seriously, when, on fetching Madame Michaud in, that lady, in the course of conversation, mentioned that her husband had that morning bought three sacks of flour and a hundred tins of preserved meats. \"He is going to get some boxes,\" she said, \"and to have the flour emptied into them, then the baker will bring them round in a cart, so that no one will guess it is flour. He says it is likely that there will be an order issued that everything of that sort is to be given into a public store for general distribution, so it must be brought here quietly. He tells me that every one he knows is doing the same thing. My servant has been out this morning eight times and has been buying eggs. She has brought a hundred each time, and we are putting them in a cask in salt.\" \"Do you really think all that is necessary, madame?\" Mary asked, doubtfully. \"Most certainly I do. They say everything will go up to such prices as never were heard of before. Of course, in a month or two the country will come to our rescue and destroy the Prussians, but till then we have got to live. Already eggs are fetching four times as much as they did last week. It is frightful to think of it, is it not, monsieur?\" \"If I were in your place, madame, I would not reckon too surely on relief in a month. I think that there is no doubt that, as you say, there will be a prohibition of anyone keeping[Pg 83] provisions of any sort, and everything will be thrown into the public magazines. Likely enough every house will be searched, and you cannot hide your things too carefully.\" \"But why should they insist on everything being put in public magazines?\" Mary asked. \"It will not go further that way than if people keep their own stocks and eat them.\" \"It will be necessary, if for nothing else, to prevent rioting when the pinch comes, and people are starving in the poorer quarters. You may be sure if they have a suspicion that the middle and upper classes have food concealed in their houses, they will break in and sack them. That would only be human nature, and therefore in the interest of order alone a decree forbidding anyone to have private stores would have to be passed; besides it would make the food go much further, for you may be sure that everything will be doled out in the smallest quantities sufficient to keep life together, and before the end of the siege comes each person may only get two or three ounces of bread a day.\" Madame Michaud nodded as if prepared to be reduced even to that extremity. \"You are right, monsieur, I am going to get stuff and to make a great number of small bags to hold the flour; then we shall hide it away under the boards in many places, so that if they find some they may not find it all.\" \"The idea is a good one, madame, but it has its disadvantages. If they find one parcel they will search so closely everywhere that they will find the rest. For that reason one good hiding-place, if you could invent one, would be better than many.\" \"One does not know what is best to do,\" Madame Michaud said, with a gesture of tragic despair. \"Who could have thought that such a thing could happen to Paris!\" \"It is unexpected, certainly,\" Cuthbert agreed, \"but it has been foreseen, otherwise they would never have taken the trouble to build this circle of forts round Paris. They are useful now not only in protecting the city but in covering a wide area, where the cattle and sheep may feed under the protection of[Pg 84] the guns. I don\u0027t think we are as likely to be as badly off for meat as for bread, for after the flocks and herds are all eaten up there are the horses, and of these there must be tens of thousands in Paris.\" \"That is a comfort, certainly,\" the Frenchwoman said, calmly, while Mary Brander made a little gesture of disgust. \"I have never tried horseflesh myself, at least that I know of, but they say it is not so bad; but I cannot think that they will have to kill the horses for food. The country will not wait until we are reduced to that extremity.\" \"Mr. Hartington has joined one of the regiments of volunteers, Madame Michaud.\" \"That is good of you, monsieur; my husband is in the National Guard, and they say every one will have to take up a musket; but as you are a foreigner, of course this would not apply to you.\" \"Well, for the time being I consider myself a Parisian, and as a German shell is just as likely to fall on the roof of the house where I live as on any other, I consider myself to be perfectly justified in doing my best in self-defence.\" \"I trust that you will call whenever you are disposed in the evening, monsieur,\" Madame Michaud said, cordially; \"it will give my husband pleasure to meet an English gentleman who is voluntarily going to fight in the cause of France.\" \"Thank you, madame. I shall be very glad to do so. Mademoiselle\u0027s father is a very old friend of our family, and I have known her ever since she was a little child. It will be pleasant to me to make the acquaintance of monsieur. And now, Miss Brander, I must be going.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3131/86097.html","bookId":893,"book":{"id":893,"title":"A Girl of the Commune","description":"简介： Jeremiah Brander was one of the most prominent personages in the Cathedral town of Abchester.
