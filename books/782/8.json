{"id":16120,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII — CHASED","content":"The party pressed forward as rapidly as they could. The ground was rough and at times very steep, and those on foot were able to keep up with the horses without much difficulty. \"You think the Indians will follow, uncle?\" Tom asked. \"They will follow, you may bet your boots, Tom; by this time they have got to the bottom of the mystery. The first thing this morning some of them will go up on to the ledge where you were, follow your tracks down to the ca?on where you left the horses, and find that you came up the valley and not down it. They will have made out that there were two whites and two red-skins, and that the two red-skins have gone up the ca?on with the horses. Directly the matter is all cleared up, they will be hotter than ever for our scalps, for there is nothing a red-skin hates worse than being fooled. Of course, they will know that it is a good deal harder to wipe out seven men than three, and I don\u0027t think they will attack us openly; they know well enough that in a fair fight two red-skins, if not three, are likely to go down for each white they rub out. But they will bide their time: red-skins are a wonderful hand at that; time is nothing to them, and they would not mind hanging about us for weeks and weeks if they can but get us at last. However, we will talk it all over when the Indians join us. I don\u0027t think there is any chance of fighting to-day, but whether we shall get out of these mountains without having another scrimmage is doubtful.\" Tom noticed that in his talk with him his uncle dropped most of the western expressions which when speaking with the others he used as freely as they did. He was now able to have a fair look at him, and found that he agreed pretty closely with the ideas he had formed of him. There was a strong likeness between him and his brother. They were about the same height, but Harry was broader and more strongly built. His face was deeply bronzed by long exposure to the wind and sun. He had a large tawny beard, while Tom\u0027s father had been clean shaved. The sailor was five years the senior, but the miner looked far younger than Tom could ever remember his father looking, for the latter had never thoroughly recovered his, health after having had a long bout of fever on the Zanzibar station; and the long stride and free carriage of his uncle was in striking contrast to the walk of his father. Both had keen gray eyes, the same outline of face, the same pleasant smile. \"Now that I can see you fairly, Tom,\" the miner said, when they halted once for the horses to come up to them, \"I can make out that you are a good deal like your father as I can first remember him.\" \"I was thinking you were very like him, uncle.\" \"We used to be alike in the old days, but I reckon the different lives we led must have changed us both a great deal. He sent me once a photograph four or five years ago, and at first I should not have known it was he. I could see the likeness after a bit, but he was very much changed. No doubt I have changed still more; all this hair on my face makes a lot of difference. You see, it is a very long time since we met. I was but twenty when I left England, and I had not seen him for two or three years before that, for he was on the Mediterranean station at the time. Well, here are the horses again, and as the ground looks flatter ahead we shall have to push on to keep up with them.\" They were presently altogether beyond the forest, and a broad plateau of bare rock stretched away in front of them for miles. \"There they are,\" Jerry Curtis shouted. \"I was beginning to feel scared that the \u0027Rappahoes had got them.\" It was a minute or two before Tom could make out the distant figures, for his eyes were less accustomed to search for moving objects than were those of his companions. \"They are riding fast,\" Harry Wade said. \"I reckon they have made out some Indians on their trail.\" The little dark mass Tom had first seen soon resolved itself into two horsemen and two riderless animals. They were still three or four miles away, but in twenty minutes they reached the party advancing to meet them. The whites waved their hats and gave them a cheer as they rode up. \"So you have managed to get through them all right, chief?\" \"The \u0027Rappahoes are dogs. They are frightened at shadows; their eyes were closed. Leaping Horse stood near their fires and saw them go forward, and knew that his white brothers must have gained the forest before the \u0027Rappahoes got to the rock. He found the horses safe, but the ca?on was very dark and in some places very narrow, with many rocks in the road, so that he had to stop till the moon was high. It was not until morning came that he reached the head of the ca?on, an hour\u0027s ride from here. Half an hour back Leaping Horse went to the edge and looked down. There were ten \u0027Rappahoes riding fast up the trail. Has my brother heard anything of the others?\" \"Nothing whatever,\" Harry said. \"I reckon they did not begin to move until daylight, and as we went on when the moon rose they must be a good two hours behind us. Which way do you think we had better go, chief?\" \"Where does my brother wish to go?\" \"It matters mighty little. I should say for a bit we had better travel along this plateau, keeping about the same distance from the timber-line. I don\u0027t think the \u0027Rappahoes will venture to attack us in the open. If we keep on here we can cross the divide and get into the Shoshones\u0027 country, and either go down the Buffalo and then up the Snake and so work down south, or go east and strike some of the streams running that way into the Big Horn.\" The chief shook his head. \"Too far, too many bad Indians; will talk over fire tonight.\" \"That is it, chief. It is a matter that wants a good deal of talking over. Anyhow, we had better be moving on at once.\" Tom was glad to find himself in the saddle again, and the party rode on at a steady pace for some hours, then they halted, lit a fire, and cooked a meal. Tom noticed that the Indians no longer took pains to gather dry sticks, but took the first that came to hand. He remarked this to Jerry. \"They know it is no use trying to hide our trail here; the two bands of Indians will follow, one up and one down, until they meet at the spot where the chief joined us. From there they can track us easy enough. Nothing would suit us better than for them to come up to us here, for we should give them fits, sartin. This is a good place. This little stream comes down from that snow peak you see over there, and we have got everything we want, for this patch of bushes will keep us in firing for a bit. You see, there are some more big hills in front of us, and we are better here than we should be among them. I expect we shall camp here for the night.\" \"Then you don\u0027t think the Indians will come up close?\" \"Not they. They will send a spy or two to crawl up, you may be sure, but they will know better than to come within reach of our rifles.\" \"I am mighty glad to have my teeth into some deer-flesh again,\" Ben Gulston said. \"We had two or three chances as we came along, but we dare not fire, and we have just been living on bread and bacon. Where did you kill these wapiti?\" \"At our first halt, near Fremont\u0027s Pass. We got two.\" \"Well, you haven\u0027t eaten much, Jerry,\" Sam Hicks said. \"I reckon four men ought pretty well to have finished off two quarters by this time.\" \"I reckon we should have finished one of the bucks, Sam; but we caught a grist of fish the same day, dried them in the sun, and I think we mostly ate them. They would not keep as well as the flesh. That is as good as the day we shot it, for up here in the dry air meat keeps a sight better than down in the plains. Give me some more tea, Sam.\" \"What do you think, mates, of camping here?\" Harry Wade said. \"The chief thinks we are better here than we should be if we moved on. He feels certain the red-skins won\u0027t dare attack us.\" There was a cordial agreement in favour of a halt, for after the work they had gone through during the last week they were glad of a rest. No one would have thought half an hour afterwards that the little party engaged in washing their shirts at the stream or mending their clothes, were in the heart of a country unknown to most of them, and menaced by a savage foe. The horses cropped the scanty tufts of grass or munched the young tops of the bushes, the rifles stood stacked by the fire, near which the two Indians sat smoking and talking earnestly together, Hunting Dog occasionally getting up and taking a long careful look over the plain. As the men finished their various jobs they came back to the fire. \"Now, chief,\" Harry said, \"let us hear your ideas as to what we had best do. We are all pretty old hands at mountaineering, but we reckon you know a great deal more about it than we do. You don\u0027t like the plans I proposed.\" \"No can do it,\" the chief said positively. \"In a moon the snow will fall, and there will be no crossing mountains.\" \"That is true enough,\" Jerry said. \"An old trapper who had lived among the Shoshones told me that nine months in the year they were shut up in the valleys by the snow on the passes.\" \"Then how can live?\" the chief went on. \"As long as we stay in this country the \u0027Rappahoes will watch us. They will tell the Bannacks and the Nez Percés, and they too would be on our trail. As long as we keep together and watch they will not come, they fear the white man\u0027s rifle; but we cannot live without hunting, and then they kill one, two, till all killed. At night must always watch, at day cannot hunt. How we live? What good to stay? If we stop all killed sure.\" There was silence round the circle. Every one of them felt the truth of the Indian\u0027s words, and yet they hated the thought of abandoning their search for gold, or, failing that, of a return home with their horses laden with beaver skins. Harry was the first to speak. \"I am afraid these varmint have interfered with our plans, mates. If we had had the luck to drop into one of the upper valleys without being noticed we could have hunted and trapped there and looked for gold for months without much chance of being discovered, but this has upset it all. I am afraid that what the chief says is true. If we keep together we starve, if we break up and hunt we shall be ambushed and killed. I hate giving up anything I have set my mind on, but this time I don\u0027t see a way out of it. We ain\u0027t the first party that has come up here and had to go back again with empty hands, and we know what happened to that party of twenty old-time miners from California two years ago, though none of them ever got back to tell the tale. We knew when we started, it wur just a chance, and the cards have gone against us.\" \"That is so,\" Ben agreed; \"if it had turned out well we might have made a good strike. It ain\u0027t turned out well, and as every day we stay here there will be more of those varmint swarming round us, I say the sooner we get out of this dog-goned country the better.\" \"You can count me in with you, Ben,\" Sam Hicks said. \"We have gone in for the game and we don\u0027t hold hands, and it ain\u0027t no use bluffing against them red-skins. We sha\u0027n\u0027t have lost much time arter all, and I reckon we have all learned something. Some day when the railroad goes right across, Uncle Sam will have to send a grist of troops to reckon up with the red-skins in these hills, and arter that it may be a good country for mining and trapping, but for the present we are a darned sight more likely to lose our scalps than to get skins.\" \"Well, Leaping Horse, which way would you advise us to take, then?\" \"Go straight back to ca?on, ride down there, cross river, go up mountains other side, pass them north of union Peak, come down on upper water Big Wind River. From there little way on to Green River. Leaping Horse never been there, but has heard. One long day\u0027s ride from here, go to upper waters of Green River.\" \"That sounds good,\" Jerry Curtis said. \"If we could once strike the Green we should be out of the \u0027Rappahoe country altogether. I have known two or three men who have been up the Green nearly to its head, and there is good hunting and a good many beaver in the side streams. I should not have thought it would have come anywhere like as near as this, but I don\u0027t doubt the chief is right.\" \"union Peak,\" the chief said, pointing to a crag rising among a tumble of hills to the south. \"Are you sure, chief?\" The Indian nodded. \"Forty, fifty miles away,\" he said. \"Leaping Horse has been to upper waters of Green River, seen the peak from other side.\" \"That settles it, then,\" Harry said. \"That is our course, there cannot be a doubt. I should never have proposed the other if I had had an idea that we were within sixty or seventy miles of the Green River. And you think we had better take the ca?on you came up by, chief?\" The Indian nodded. \"If go down through forest may be ambushed. Open ground from here back to ca?on. \u0027Rappahoes most in front. Think we go that way, not think we go back. Get good start. Once across river follow up little stream among hills other side, that the way to pass. If \u0027Rappahoes follow us we fight them.\" \"Yes, we shall have them at an advantage there, for they would have to come up under our fire, and there are sure to be places where half a dozen men could keep fifty at bay. Very well, chief, that is settled. When do you think we had better start?\" \"When gets dark,\" the chief replied. \"No lose time, more Indian come every hour. Keep fire burning well, \u0027Rappahoes think we camp here. Take horses a little way off and mount beyond light of fire.\" \"You think they will be watching us?\" \"Sure to watch. First ride north half an hour, then turn and ride to ca?on. If spies see us go off take word to friends we gone north. Too dark to follow trail. They think they catch us easy to-morrow, and take up trail in morning; but too late then, we cross river before that.\" There was a general murmur of assent. The thought of being constantly watched, and suddenly attacked when least expecting it, made them feel restless, and the thought of early action was pleasant to them. \"You don\u0027t think that there are any spies watching us now, uncle, do you?\" \"Not close, Tom; they would know better than that. They could see us miles away if we were to mount and ride off, and it is only when it gets dark that they would venture to crawl up, for if one were sighted in the daytime he would not have a ghost of a chance of getting away, for we could ride him down sartin.\" \"Well, I reckon we may as well take a sleep,\" Sam Hicks said. \"You lie down for one, anyhow, Harry, for you watched last evening. We will toss up which of us keeps awake.\" \"Leaping Horse will keep watch,\" the chief said quietly. \"No fear of Indians, but better to watch.\" Knowing the power of the red-skins to keep awake for an almost unlimited time, none of the others thought of refusing the offer, and in a few minutes all were sound asleep. Towards sunset they were on their feet again. Another meal was cooked and eaten, then as it became dusk the horses were gathered fifty yards away, and Hunting Dog and Tom took their places beside them. \"Keep your eyes open and your rifle handy, Tom,\" his uncle said. \"It is like enough that some young brave, anxious to distinguish himself, may crawl up with the intention of stampeding the ponies, though I don\u0027t think he would attempt it till he thought most of us were asleep. Still, there is no saying.\" The watch was undisturbed, and soon it became so dark that objects could no longer be seen fifty yards away. Tom began to feel nervous. Every tuft of ground, every little bush seemed to him to take the form of a crawling Indian, and he felt a great sense of relief when he saw the figures round the fire rise and walk towards him. \"I am glad you have come, uncle,\" he said frankly; \"I began to feel very uncomfortable several times. It seemed to me that some of the bushes moved.\" \"That is just what I thought you would be feeling, Tom. But it was just as well that your first watch should be a short one, without much chance of an ambush being on foot; and I knew that if your eyes deceived you, Hunting Dog was there. Next time you won\u0027t feel so nervous; that sort of thing soon passes off.\" A fresh armful of brushwood had been thrown on to the fire before the men left it, and long after they had ridden away they could see the flames mounting high. After riding north for a quarter of an hour they changed their route and passed round, leaving the fire half a mile on their right. The light of the stars was quite sufficient for them to travel by, and after four hours\u0027 journey the chief, who was riding ahead, halted. \"Not far from ca?on now. Listen.\" A very faint murmur came to their ears, so faint that had not his attention been drawn to it Tom would not have noticed it at all. \"What is that noise?\" he asked. \"That is the stream down in the ca?on,\" his uncle replied. \"How far are we from the head, chief?\" \"Not far, must ride slow.\" They proceeded at a walk, changing their course a little towards the east. Hunting Dog went on ahead, and in a quarter of an hour they heard his signal, the cry of an owl. It arose from a point still further east, and quickening their pace, in a few minutes they came up to the young Indian, who was standing by his horse at the edge of a steep descent, at the bottom of which Tom could see a stream of water. \"It looks very steep,\" Jerry said. \"Steep, but smooth,\" the Indian replied. \"Came up here with horses this morning.\" All dismounted, and Tom went up to his horse\u0027s head. \"That won\u0027t do, Tom. Never go before a horse down a steep place where you can\u0027t see your way, always drive it before you.\" There was some trouble in getting the horses to commence the descent, but after a short time the chief\u0027s pony set the example; and tucking its hind legs under it until it sat down on its haunches, began to slide down, while the other animals, after staring into the darkness with ears laid back and snorting with fear, were half-persuaded, half-forced to follow its example, and the men went down after them. The descent was not so steep as in the darkness it looked, and the depth was not over fifty feet. As soon as they reached the bottom they mounted again, and the chief leading the way, they rode down the ca?on. At first they were able to proceed at a fair pace, but as the sides grew higher and more precipitous the darkness became more dense, and they were obliged to pick their way with great caution among the boulders that strewed the bottom of the ravine. Several times they had to dismount in order to get the horses over heavy falls, and it was four hours from the time they entered the ca?on before they approached its mouth. When they entered the little wood where they had first left the horses, the chief said, \"Make fire, cook food here. Leaping Horse and Hunting Dog go on and scout, maybe \u0027Rappahoes left watch in valley.\" \"Very well, chief. It is seven hours since we started; I think the horses will be all the better for an hour\u0027s rest, and I am sure we shall be the better of a feed. Besides, when we are once out of this hole we may have to travel fast.\" \"You don\u0027t think it likely that the \u0027Rappahoes are on the look-out for us at the entrance?\" Tom asked, as the Indians moved away. \"Not likely at all, Tom. Still, as they might reckon that if we gave their searching party the slip we must come down again by the river or through this ca?on, they may have left a party or sent down word to some of their villages to keep a watch in the valley.\" It was more than an hour before the Indians returned. \"No \u0027Rappahoes in valley,\" the chief said, as he seated himself by the fire and began without loss of time to eat the meat they had cooked in readiness. \"Better be going soon, must cross river and get on before light come; have seen fires, Indian villages up on hillsides. When light comes and \u0027Rappahoes find trail they come back quick.\" \"You may bet your boots they will, chief,\" Sam Hicks said. \"They will be a pretty mad crowd when they make out that we have come down again by the ca?on. As soon as they see which way we have headed some of them will make a bee-line down here in hopes of cutting us off at the mouth, but by the time they are here we shall be half-way up the hill.\" The Indian made no reply, but he and Hunting Dog ate their meal steadily, and as soon as they had finished rose to their feet, and saying \"Time to go\" went out to fetch in their horses. \"I don\u0027t think the chief is as confident we shall get off without a fight as Sam seemed to be,\" Tom said to his uncle. \"There is never any saying what an Indian thinks, Tom, even when he has fallen into white man\u0027s ways, as Leaping Horse has done. It may be that the sight of the fires he made out on the opposite hills has troubled him. It will be light before we are far up on the side, and we may be made out by some of the varmint there. They are always restless. Go into an Indian village when you will, you will find some of them smoking by the fire. Their ears are so \u0027tarnal sharp, they can hear sounds that would never catch our ears, not at half the distance. The clink of a couple of pans together, or a stone set rolling by a horse\u0027s tread, were it ever so faint, would bring them on their feet directly, especially now they know that a war-party is out.\" The march was again resumed. Passing through the narrowest part of the ca?on they issued out into the valley and made for the river. Some time was lost here, for Sam Hicks, who was leading one of the pack-ponies, was carried down several hundred yards by the stream, and with difficulty effected his landing. The horse\u0027s load shifted and had to be repacked. As soon as this was done they followed the river down for two miles till they came upon a stream running into it from the southwest. \"You think this is the stream we have to follow, chief?\" \"Must be him, no other came in on this side for a long way; right line for peak.\" They turned up by the stream, and after riding a mile found themselves entering a mountain gorge. It was not a ca?on but a steep, narrow valley. They picked their way with the greatest caution for some time, then the two Indians stopped simultaneously. \"What is the matter, chief?\" Harry, who was riding next to them, whispered. \"Smell smoke.\" Harry sniffed the air. \"I can\u0027t say I smell it, chief, but if you say you do that settles it. Where do you think it comes from?\" \"Up valley; wind light, but comes that way. Indian village up here.\" \"Well, so much the worse for the Indian village if it interferes with us,\" Harry said grimly; \"there is one thing certain, we have got to go through. Probably most of the braves are away up in the hills.\" They now went on with redoubled caution. The chief gave his bridle to Hunting Dog and went forward on foot. A hundred yards farther the valley made a sharp turn and then widened out considerably, and the glow of a fire was visible among some trees standing on the hillside some fifty feet above the level of the stream. The chief looked at the sky; a faint light was breaking, and without pausing he continued to lead the way. They passed under the Indian encampment, and had got a few yards higher when the pony Sam Hicks was leading gave a sharp neigh. \"Darn its old ears!\" Tom heard Jerry growl. Harry at the same moment put his horse to a trot, and the others following clattered up the valley, knowing that concealment was no longer of any use; indeed, an answering neigh from above and hurried shouts were heard, followed a moment afterwards by a loud yell as an Indian running through the trees caught sight of them in the moonlight. \"We are in for it now, Tom; that is, if there are men enough in the village to attack us.\" The horses broke into a gallop. They had gone but fifty yards when a rifle-shot was heard from behind, and Tom felt a shock as the ball struck his saddle. Almost immediately another shot was fired abreast of him, and an Indian yell rose loudly behind them. A moment later Leaping Horse with a shout of triumph bounded down the rocks and leapt on to his horse. Four or five more shots were fired from behind, but none of them were hit. A hundred yards farther they were in shelter of a belt of trees that extended down to the stream. As they entered it Harry looked back. He could now see the hills beyond the main valley. \"Look, chief!\" he exclaimed. \"The varmint up there are signalling far off above the timber-line.\" Bright tongues of fire could be seen, two close together and one a short distance to the left. \"What does that mean, uncle?\" Tom asked, as the chief gave a short exclamation of surprise and anger. \"It means, lad, that the red-skins have been sharper than we gave them credit for. When their spies brought them news that we had started they must have come down to the fire and followed our trail at once with torches, before we had got above an hour or two away. No doubt it was slow work, but they must have found where we changed our course, and made out that we were making for the head of the ca?on. I expect most of them lost no time in following the trail farther, but rode straight for the head of the ca?on, and like enough they weren\u0027t half an hour behind us when we came out. The others rode to the edge of the plateau and set those fires alight.\" \"But what do they mean, uncle?\" \"They are a warning to all the villages that we have headed back, you may be sure of that, though I can\u0027t say what the message is, for every tribe has its own signals, but it will have set them on the watch up and down the valley; and like enough the signal has been repeated somewhere at a point where it can be seen straight down the Big Wind Valley. The shooting will tell them all which way we are making, and if the \u0027Rappahoes have come out of the ca?on, as I reckon they have, they need lose no more time in looking for our trail. I reckon in half an hour we shall have a hundred or so of the varmint after us. I only hope there are no more villages upon this line. I don\u0027t so much care about the fellows who are following us, we are sure to find some place where we can make a stand, but it would be awkward if we find our way barred.\" \"But if there is no one in front, uncle, I should think we might be able to keep ahead. Our horses are as good as they are likely to have.\" \"You and Jerry might be able to, Tom, for you have got hold of two first-rate ponies; but the Indians\u0027 are nothing out of the way, and our ponies ain\u0027t in it with you; besides, they and the pack-horses have all been doing hard work for the last week with none too much food, and many of the \u0027Rappahoes will be on fresh horses. I expect we have got some very tall climbing to do before we get up to the pass, and we have got to do our fighting before we get there.\" The ground rose steeply, and was encumbered by fallen stones and boulders, and it was not long before the pack-horses began to show signs of distress, while those ridden by Harry and his two comrades were drawing their breath in short gasps. After emerging from the trees the ravine had run in almost a straight line for more than half a mile, and just as they reached the end of this stretch a yell was heard down the valley. Looking back they saw eight or ten mounted Indians emerging from the wood at the lower end. \"That is a signal,\" Harry exclaimed, as four rifles were fired in quick succession. \"Well, we have got a bit of a start of them, and they won\u0027t venture to attack us until some more come up. We had better take it a bit quietly, chief, or our horses will give out. I expect we sha\u0027n\u0027t be long before we come upon a place where we can make a stand.\" The Seneca looked round at the horses. \"You, Sam, Ben and pack-horses go on till you get to place where can fight. We four wait here; got good horses, and can ride on. We stop them here for a bit.\" \"That would be best. I don\u0027t like being out of it, but we will do our share presently.\" No more words were necessary. Harry and his two mates rode on at a slower pace than before, while the two Indians, Jerry, and Tom dismounted, left their horses beyond the turn, and then coming back took up their positions behind four large boulders. The Indians had noticed their returning figures, for they suddenly drew up their horses and gathered together in consultation. \"Draw your bullet, Tom,\" Jerry said, \"and drop in half a charge more powder; I reckon that piece of yours will send a bullet among them with the help of a good charge. Allow a bit above that top notch for extra, elevation. It\u0027s a good big mark, and you ought to be able to plump a bullet among them.\" Tom followed the instructions, and then resting the barrel on the top of the boulder took a steady aim and fired. There was a sudden stir among the group of Indians. A horse reared high in the air, almost unseating its rider, and then they all rode off at the top of their speed, and halted two or three hundred yards lower down the valley. The Senecas uttered a grunt of approval. \"That was a good shot, Tom, though I wish you had hit one of the red-skins instead of his critter. Still, it will give them a good lesson, and make them mighty keerful. They won\u0027t care about showing their ugly heads within range of a piece that will carry five hundred yards.\" A quarter of an hour passed without any movement on the part of the Indians. Then a large party of horsemen appeared from the trees below, and were greeted by them with a yell of satisfaction. \"There must be well-nigh fifty of them,\" Jerry said. \"I reckon it\u0027s the party that came down the hill. They must have picked up a good many others by the way. Now the fun is going to begin.\" After five minutes\u0027 consultation some twenty of the Indians dismounted, and dividing into two parties ascended the slopes of the valley and began to move forward, taking advantage of every stone and bush, so that it was but occasionally that a glimpse of one of their bodies was obtained. \"They are going to skirmish up to us,\" Jerry said, \"till they are near enough to make it hot for us if we show a head above the rocks to fire. As soon as they can do that, the others will charge. I think they are not more than four hundred yards off now, Tom. That is within your range, so you may as well begin to show them that we are awake. If you can bring one down it will check their pace.\" Tom had just noticed three Indians run behind a clump of bushes, and he now levelled his rifle so that it bore on a spot a foot on one side of it. Half a minute later an Indian appeared at the bush and began to run forward. Tom pressed the trigger. The Indian ran a few steps, and then fell forward on his face. \"Bravo, Plumb-centre!\" Jerry shouted. \"We said that you would do the rifle credit, Tom, and Billy the Scout could not have done better himself.\" \"Young white man make great hunter,\" the chief remarked approvingly. \"Got good eye and steady hand.\" The lesson had its effect. The Indian advance was no longer rapid, but was conducted with the greatest caution, and it was only occasionally that a glimpse could be caught of a dusky figure passing from rock to rock. When they came within three hundred yards the two Indians and Jerry also opened fire. One fell to a shot from the chief, but neither of the others hit their marks. Tom indeed did not fire again, the movements of the Indians being so rapid that they were gone before he could bring his sight to bear upon any of them. \"Go now,\" the chief said. \"\u0027Rappahoes fire soon; run quick.\" It was but a few yards to shelter. As they dashed across the intervening space two or three Indian rifles rang out, but the rest of the assailants had been too much occupied in sheltering themselves and looking for the next spot to make for, to keep an eye upon the defenders, and the hastily-fired shots all missed. A moment later the party mounted their horses and rode up the ravine, the yells of the Indians ringing in their ears. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3151/86543.html","bookId":782,"book":{"id":782,"title":"In the Heart of the Rockies","description":"简介： I can be of no use here, Carry.
