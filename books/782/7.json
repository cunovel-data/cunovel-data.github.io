{"id":16119,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI — UNITED","content":"The ca?on showed no sign of widening until they had proceeded a quarter of a mile from the entrance, then it broadened suddenly for a distance of a hundred yards. \"There has been a big slip here both sides,\" the miner said, looking round. \"It must have taken place a great many years ago, for the winter floods have swept away all signs of it, and there are grass and trees on the slopes. The horses can find enough to keep them alive here for a day or two, and that is all we shall want, I hope.\" \"It would be a nasty place to get out of, Jerry, for the cliffs are perpendicular from half-way up.\" \"It ain\u0027t likely as there is any place we could get out without following it to the upper end, which may be some fifty miles away. I don\u0027t know the country it runs through, but the red-skins are pretty certain to know all about it. If they were to track us here they would never try to fight their way in, but would just set a guard at the mouth and at the upper end and starve us out. It is a good place to hide in, but a dog-goned bad one to be caught in. However, I hope it ain\u0027t coming to that. It is we who are going to attack them, and not them us, and that makes all the difference. The red-skins can\u0027t have a notion that there are any other white men in this neighbourhood, and when we open fire on them it will raise such a scare for a bit that it will give us a chance of joining the others if we choose. That of course must depend on their position.\" They walked back to the mouth of the ca?on, and had not to wait long for the return of the Indians. \"Come,\" Leaping Horse said briefly, at once turning and going off at a swift pace. Jerry asked no questions, but with Tom followed close on the Indians\u0027 heels. There were bushes growing among the fallen rocks and débris from the face of the cliff, and they were, therefore, able to go forward as quickly as they could leap from boulder to boulder, without fear of being seen. A quarter of an hour\u0027s run, and the chief climbed up to a ledge on the face of the cliff where a stratum harder than those above it had resisted the effects of the weather and formed a shelf some twelve feet wide. He went down on his hands and knees, and keeping close to the wall crawled along to a spot where some stunted bushes had made good their hold. The others followed him, and lying down behind the bushes peered through them. The valley was four or five hundred yards wide, and down its centre ran the stream. Close to the water\u0027s edge rose abruptly a steep rock. It was some fifty feet in height and but four or five yards across at the top. On the north and west the rocks were too perpendicular to be climbed, but the other sides had crumbled down, the stones being covered with brushwood. From the point where they were looking they could see the six horses lying among the bushes. They were evidently tightly roped, and had probably been led up there when the attack began and thrown at the highest point to which they could be taken, a spot being chosen where the bushes concealed their exact position from those below. The rock was about two hundred and fifty yards from the spot where the party was lying, and their position was about level with its top. Some twenty Indians were gathered a few hundred yards higher up the valley, and about as many some distance down it. \"Why didn\u0027t the varmint take their places here?\" Jerry whispered to the chief. \"They came here. See,\" and he pointed to a patch of blood a few feet beyond him. \"Indian guns not shoot far,\" he said, \"powder weak; white man\u0027s rifles carry here, red-skin not able to shoot so far. When they found that, went away again.\" \"What are they going to do now, do you think?\" \"Soon attack again.\" Half an hour passed, and then a loud yell gave the signal and the two troops galloped towards the rock. They had evidently had experience of the accuracy of the white men\u0027s fire; not an Indian showed himself, each dropping over one side of his pony, with an arm resting in a rope round the animals\u0027 necks and one leg thrown over the back. So they dashed forward until close to the foot of the rocks. Another instant and they would have thrown themselves from their horses and taken to the bushes, but although hidden from the sight of the defenders of the position, they were exposed to the full view of the party on the ledge, from whom they were distant not more than two hundred yards. The chief fired first, and almost together the other three rifles flashed out. Three of the Indians fell from their horses, another almost slipped off, but with an effort recovered his hold with his leg. A yell of astonishment and fear broke from the Indians. As the two bands mingled together, some of the riders were exposed to those on the top of the rock, and three shots were fired. Two more of the \u0027Rappahoes fell, and the whole band in obedience to a shout from one of their chiefs galloped at full speed down the valley. The three men sprang to their feet, waving their hats, while the party on the ledge also leapt up with a shout. \"It\u0027s you, chief, I see!\" one of those on the rocks shouted. \"I have been hoping ever since morning to hear the crack of your rifle, and I never heard a more welcome sound. We should have been rubbed out sure. Who have you got with you?\" \"It\u0027s Jerry Curtis, Harry. I come up along with Leaping Horse, though I did not expect to find you in such a bad fix. This young Indian is Hunting Dog, and this young chap next to me is your nephew, Tom Wade. You did not expect to meet him like this, I reckon?\" While he had been speaking, all had reloaded their rifles. \"You had best go across and talk it over with Harry, chief, and consart measures with him for getting out of this fix. Those red-skins have got a bad scare, but you may bet they ain\u0027t gone far; and they have lost six of their bucks now beside what the others shot before, and it ain\u0027t in Indian natur for them to put up with such a loss as that.\" He had been looking at the rock as he spoke, and turning round uttered an exclamation of surprise, for the chief was no longer there. Looking down they saw that he had managed to make his way down the face of the cliff, and in another two minutes was ascending the rock. There he stood for some time in earnest conversation with the whites, and then returned to the ledge. \"Trouble over horses,\" he said. \"Ay, ay, I reckoned that was what you was talking over. There ain\u0027t no going back for them now.\" The chief shook his head. \"\u0027Rappahoes keep watch,\" he said, \"cannot go till night to fetch horses. All lie here to-day, go across to rock when darkness comes, then white men go up valley till get to trees an hour\u0027s march away; can see them from rock. Get in among trees and work up into hills. Leaping Horse and Hunting Dog cross river, go down other side past \u0027Rappahoes, then cross back and get into ca?on, drive horses up. White men meet them up in mountains.\" \"That seems a good plan enough, chief. That is, if you can get out at the other end of the ca?on.\" \"Ca?on little up high,\" the chief replied. \"Find some place to climb.\" \"But they may find the horses to-day.\" The Indian nodded. \"May find, perhaps not.\" \"Why should we not go across to the rock at once, chief?\" \"Indian count on fingers how many. They do not know we only four; much troubled in their mind where men come from, who can be. Red-skins not like white men. Have many fancies. Fire come out of bush where \u0027Rappahoe had been killed; think that bad medicine, keep together and talk. Think if men here, why not go across to rock.\" \"I should not be surprised if you are right, chief. They are more likely to fancy we have come down from above than from below, for they must have reckoned for sure there were no other white men in the Big Wind valley, and our not showing ourselves will give them an all-fired scare.\" \"What does the chief mean by bad medicine, Jerry?\" Tom asked. \"A red-skin is full of all sorts of ideas. Anything he can\u0027t make head nor tail of, is bad medicine; they think there is some magic in it, and that old Nick has had his finger in the pie. When they get an idea like that in their minds, even the bravest of them loses his pluck, and is like a child who thinks he has seen a ghost. It is a mighty good notion for us to lie low all day. The red-skins will reason it all out, and will say, if these are white men who killed our brothers why the \u0027tarnal don\u0027t they go and join the others, there ain\u0027t nothing to prevent them. If they ain\u0027t white men, who are they? Maybe they can move without our being able to see them and will shoot from some other place. No, I reckon it is likely they will keep pretty close together and won\u0027t venture to scatter to look for tracks, and in that case the chief\u0027s plan will work out all right. In course, a good deal depends on their chief; one of them is among those we shot, you can make out his feathers from here. If he is the boss chief, it may be that they will give it up altogether; the next chief will throw the blame on to him, and may like enough persuade them to draw off altogether. If it ain\u0027t the boss chief, then they are bound to try again. He would not like to take them back to their villages with the news that a grist of them had been killed and narry a scalp taken. I expect you will see this afternoon some of them come down to palaver with Harry.\" The morning passed quietly and not unpleasantly, for they were lying in the shade, but before noon the sun had climbed up over the cliff behind them and shone down with great force, and they had to lie with their heads well under the bushes to screen them from its rays. Presently, Leaping Horse said: \"Indian chief come, no lift heads.\" All shifted their position so as to look down the valley. An Indian chief, holding up his hands to show that he was unarmed, was advancing on foot, accompanied by another Indian also without arms. \"There is Harry going down to meet them,\" Jerry said. Tom looked eagerly at the figure that came down from the rock and advanced to meet the Indians. It seemed strange to him that after having come so far to join his uncle they should remain for hours in sight of each other without meeting. It was too far to distinguish his features, but he saw by the light walk and easy swing of the figure that his uncle was a much more active man than he had expected to see. He had known indeed that he was but forty years old, but he had somehow expected that the life of hardship he had led would have aged him, and he was surprised to see that his walk and figure were those of a young man. \"Is it not rather dangerous, his coming down alone to meet two of them? They may have arms hidden.\" \"They have got arms, you maybe sure,\" Jerry replied. \"They have knives for certain, and most likely tomahawks, but I expect Harry has got his six-shooter. But it don\u0027t matter whether he has or not, there are his two mates up on that rock with their rifles, and we are across here. The \u0027Rappahoes would know well enough their lives wouldn\u0027t be worth a red cent if they were to try any of their games. They don\u0027t mean business; they will make out they have come to persuade Harry and his mates to give up, which they know quite well they ain\u0027t fools enough to do. But what is really in their minds is to try and find out who we are, and where we have come from.\" The conversation lasted a few minutes. Tom could see that questions were being asked about the concealed party, for the chief pointed to the ledge two or three times. When the talk was over the Indians went down the valley again at a slow pace, never once looking back, and the Englishman returned to the rocks. \"I don\u0027t suppose they have got much from Harry.\" \"I suppose uncle talks their language?\" \"No, I don\u0027t reckon he knows the \u0027Rappahoe dialect. But the tribes on the western side of the plains can mostly understand each other\u0027s talk; and as I know he can get on well with the Utes, he is sure to be able to understand the \u0027Rappahoes\u0027 talk.\" \"Leaping Horse will go along the ledge,\" the chief said a few minutes later, after a short conversation with Hunting Dog. \"The \u0027Rappahoes will try to find out who are here; not like to attack the rock till find out.\" The two Indians lay down flat on the ledge, and crawled along without raising themselves in the slightest until they reached a point where the cliffs projected somewhat. From here they could see down the valley, and they lay immovable, with their rifles in front of them. \"They are not more than fifty yards or so from those bushes where we got up on to the ledge. That is where the red-skins are likely to try crawling up, for there they would be out of sight of the rock.\" \"Surely they would never venture to come along the ledge in daylight, Jerry. They would have to pass along under the fire of uncle and his mates, and would have our rifles to meet in front.\" \"No, it would only be one, or at most, two scouts. They would reckon that from that point where the chief is lying they would get a view right along the ledge to here, and be able to make out what we are. It is the strangeness of the thing that has kept them quiet all these hours, and I expect their chief will want to prove that there are only a few of us, and that we are men for certain. I reckon they have sent off to the villages already, and there will be more of the varmint here to-night. The Indians are never fond of attacking in the dark; still, if they were sure about us, they might try it. They would know they could get up to the foot of that rock before being seen, and once among the bushes they would reckon they could make easy work of it.\" A quarter of an hour later there was the crack of a rifle, followed instantly by an Indian yell. \"That is the chief\u0027s piece, Tom, and I reckon the lead has gone straight.\" The silence remained unbroken for the next two hours, and then Leaping Horse crawled back as quietly as he had gone. \"What was it, chief?\" \"It was a \u0027Rappahoe, who will scout no more,\" the chief said quietly. \"He came up the bushes, but before he could step on to the ledge Leaping Horse fired, and he will take no tales back to his tribe.\" \"They won\u0027t try again, chief?\" Leaping Horse shook his head. \"First take rock,\" he said, \"then when they have the scalps of the white men they will watch us here. Will know we cannot stay here long without water.\" \"You are right there, chief, and no m\u0027stake; my tongue is like a piece of leather now, and as soon as it gets dark I shall make a bee-line down to the river. I want to have a talk with Harry, but just at present I want a drink a blamed sight worse. If I had thought we were going to be stuck up here all day I would have brought my water-bottle with me.\" The time passed very slowly, although the air became cooler as soon as the sun had gone down behind the opposite range. As soon as the light faded a little, the Indian crawled farther along the ledge, and returned in a short time saying that he had found a spot where the whites could descend. Two or three times Jerry urged that it was dark enough, before the chief consented to move. At last, however, he stood up and gave the cry of an owl, and they were in a minute or two joined by Hunting Dog, who had until now remained at his post. The chief at once led the way along the ledge until he reached the spot where the rock had crumbled away somewhat. \"We had better go down one at a time,\" Jerry said. \"For if there was a slip or a tumble it might let down a gun-hammer, and we want our lead for the \u0027Rappahoes, and not for each other.\" When it came to Tom\u0027s turn, he found it a very difficult place to get down in the semi-darkness, and two or three times he almost lost his footing. As soon as all were down they fell into Indian file, and crossed the valley to the rock, the chief giving the hoot of an owl twice as he approached it. Three men at once stepped out from the bushes at its foot. \"I began to wonder when you were coming, and was just going to get the ponies down before it was too dark to do it without running the risk of breaking their legs. Well, I am right glad to see you, Jerry; and you too, Tom, though it is too dark to see much of you. The chief has been telling me how he brought you along. There is no time to talk now, but I am right glad to see you, lad\" and he shook Tom heartily by the hand. \"Now, mates, let us get the horses down.\" \"I must make tracks for the water first, Harry, the young un and I are pretty near choking; and I expect the Indians are as bad, though it ain\u0027t their natur to talk about it.\" \"Get down horses first,\" the chief said. \"Too dark soon.\" \"Waal, I suppose five minutes won\u0027t make much difference,\" Jerry grumbled, \"so here goes.\" \"I have tied some hide over their hoofs,\" Harry said, \"so as to make as little noise as possible about it.\" \"Must make no noise,\" the chief said urgently. \"Redskin scouts soon be crawling up.\" One by one the horses were brought down, Harry leading them, and the others pushing aside the bushes as noiselessly as possible. Then their loads were carried down and packed upon them. \"You get on my horse, Jerry,\" Harry Wade whispered, \"I will walk with Tom. I have had no time to say a word to him yet, or to ask about the people at home. Where is the chief?\" Leaping Horse and his companion had stolen away as soon as the loads had been adjusted. The others led the horses to the river, and allowed them to drink, while Jerry and Tom lay down and took a long draught of the water. The miners\u0027 bottles were filled, and they then started. \"It is lucky the river makes such a roar among these rocks here,\" Harry said, \"it will drown the sound of the horses\u0027 hoofs.\" For half an hour they proceeded at a fast walk, then the skins were taken off the horses\u0027 feet and they went on at a trot, the two Wades taking hold of Jerry\u0027s stirrup-leathers and running alongside. In half an hour they entered the belt of trees, and dismounting, at once began to ascend the hill. They were some distance up when they heard a distant yell. \"You may yell as much as you like,\" Jerry panted, \"you won\u0027t catch us now. They have been a mighty long time finding out we were gone.\" \"They could not make out about you,\" Harry said. \"I could see by the chief\u0027s manner, and the glances the Indian with him kept giving to the place where you were lying, that they were puzzled and alarmed. They offered if we would surrender that they would allow us to return down the valley without hurt. I said, of course, that I preferred staying where I was; we had come up the valley and intended going farther; we didn\u0027t want to interfere with them, and if they had left us alone we should have left them alone; and they had only themselves to thank for the loss of some of their braves. \u0027We have,\u0027 I said, \u0027many friends, who will protect us, and much harm will fall on the Indians who venture to meddle with us.\u0027 \"\u0027Are your friends white men?\u0027 the chief asked. \u0027Have they wings that they have flown down here from the hills?\u0027 \"\u0027They have come, that is enough,\u0027 I said. \u0027You see, when they were wanted they were here, and if they are wanted again you will hear of them, and your braves will die, and you will gain nothing. You had best go back to your lodges and leave us to go away in peace. Whoever they are, they can shoot, as you have found out to your cost. They have no ill-will to the red-skins, providing the redskins let us alone. They only fired four shots; if they had wished to, they could have killed many more.\u0027 When the chief saw that he could get nothing further from me he went away. As usual he spoke boastfully at last, and said that he had offered peace to us, and if war came, it would be our faults. I laughed, and said that we could take care of ourselves, and preferred doing so to trusting ourselves in the hands of the \u0027Rappahoes, when we had made some of their squaws widows.\" \"Would they have kept their word, uncle, do you think?\" Tom asked. \"Not they. There are a few of the Indian tribes whose word can be taken, but as a rule words mean nothing with them, and if we had put ourselves in their power they would have tomahawked us instantly, or else taken us down and tortured us at their villages, which would have been a deal worse. I have no doubt they had a long talk after the chief returned to them, and that it was some time after it became dark before they could pluck up courage enough to climb the rock, though I expect they must have got close to it very soon after we left. I reckon they have been crawling up inch by inch. Of course, directly they got to where the horses had been tied they knew we had gone, and I expect that yell was a signal for a rush forward to the top. But we need not bother any more about them. They may ride as far as the foot of the forest, but when they find we have gained that safely they will give it up until morning; they will know well enough it is no good starting to search the woods in the dark. We may as well rest where we are until the moon is up, for we make so much noise crashing through this undergrowth that they could hear us down there.\" \"Now tell me, lad, about your mother and sisters, and how you came out after all.\" Tom told his uncle of his mother\u0027s death, and the reason why he had left his sisters to come out to join him. \"It is a very bad business, lad, and I take a lot of blame to myself. When I got your mother\u0027s letter, telling me of poor John\u0027s death, and that she would not hear of your coming out, I said some very hard things to myself. Here had I been knocking about for twenty years, and having had a fair share of luck, and yet I could not put my hand on five hundred dollars, and there was my brother\u0027s widow and children, and I, their nearest relative, could not help them. It made me feel a pretty mean man, I can tell you. Your mother did not say much about her circumstances, but it did not need that. I knew that John had retired from the navy with little besides his half-pay, and that her pension as his widow must be a mighty slim one. Altogether I had a pretty bad time of it. However, I took a tall oath that the next rich strike I made the dollars should not be thrown away. I reckoned that you would be out before long; for it was certain that if you were a lad of spirit you would not be staying there doing nothing. Your mother said that the girls all intended to take up teaching, and it was not likely that you would let them work for the family while you were loafing about at home. I know in my time it was hard enough to get anything to do there, and young fellows who have come out here to ranche tell me that it is harder than ever now. I thought you would fancy this life, and that in time you would talk your mother over into letting you come.\" \"I should never have got her to agree to it, uncle. I wanted to go to sea, but after father\u0027s death she would not hear of it. She said I was her only boy and that she could not spare me, and I had to promise to give up the thought. She was still more against your plan, but when I wrote to you I thought that possibly in time she might agree to it. But it was not long afterwards that her health began to fail, and I saw then that I must give up all thought of leaving her, and must, when I left school, take anything that offered; and it was only after her death that I talked it over with the girls, and they agreed that to come here was the best thing for me.\" \"And you left before my last letter arrived?\" \"Yes; we had no letter after the one you wrote asking me to come out.\" \"No, I suppose you could not have had it. I wrote before I started out three months ago from Salt Lake City. I had struck a ledge of pretty good stuff, I and another. We sold out for a thousand dollars, and I sent my share off to your mother, telling her that I had been having bad luck since I got her letter, but that I hoped to do better in future, and I thought, anyhow, I could promise to send her as much once a year, and if I had a real stroke of luck she and her girls would have the benefit of it.\" \"That was good of you, uncle.\" \"Not good at all,\" Harry Wade grumbled. \"I have behaved like a fool all along; it is true that when I did get letters from your father, which was not very often, he always wrote cheerfully, and said very little about how he was situated as to money. But I ought to have known—I did know, if I thought of it—that with a wife and six children it must be mighty hard to make ends meet on a lieutenant\u0027s half-pay, and there was I, often throwing away twice as much as his year\u0027s pension on a week\u0027s spree. When I heard he was gone you may pretty well guess how I felt. However, lad, if things turn out well I will make it up as far as I can. Now, let us join the others.\" The others, however, were all sound asleep, having wrapped themselves in their blankets, and lain down as soon as the halt was decided upon. Jerry, having had no sleep the previous night, and but little for four or five days, had not even thought of asking the others for food, which they doubtless had on their saddles, although he had tasted nothing for twenty-four hours. Tom, however, less accustomed to enforced fasts, felt ravenous. \"We have had nothing to eat to-day, uncle, except a crust left over from yesterday\u0027s baking, and I don\u0027t think I could get to sleep if I did not eat something.\" \"Bless me, I never thought of that, Tom. If I had I would have sent food across by the chief this morning. There is no bread, but there is plenty of cold meat. We cooked a lot yesterday evening, for we thought we might not get a chance of cooking to-day.\" \"Then you knew, uncle, the Indians were near?\" Tom went on, when he had appeased his appetite and taken a drink of water, with a little whisky in it from his uncle\u0027s flask. \"Ay, lad; we guessed somehow we had been followed all along. We had done everything we could to throw them off the trail—travelling as much as we could in the course of streams, muffling the feet of our ponies, and picking out the hardest ground to travel on; but every morning before daybreak one of us went up the hillside, and twice we made out mounted Indians moving about down the valley. Yesterday morning ten of them came galloping up within easy shot. I don\u0027t think they thought that we were so near. They drew up their horses suddenly, had a talk, and then came riding after us. It didn\u0027t need their yells to tell us what their intention was. We knocked three of them out of their saddles, then threw our horses down and lay behind them. \"They galloped round and round us shooting, but we picked two more off, and then they rode away. We knew enough of them to be sure that they were not going to give it up, but would follow us till joined by enough of their tribe to attack us again. We made a long march, hoping to get to the timber before they could come up, but just as the sun was setting we saw them coming along, about fifteen of them; and we had just time to get up to that rock. As they rode past we opened a smart fire and dropped four of them; the others rode up the valley, so as to cut us off from going farther. We filled our water-skins and got the horses half-way up as you saw, and then lighted a fire and cooked. We kept watch all night, two down below and one at the top; but everything was quiet, and we guessed they were waiting for others to come up. \"About an hour before daylight we heard another gang arrive below us. They halted there, and it was not long before they began crawling up from above and below, and for a bit we shot pretty brisk. The odds were too much against them, with us on the height, and they drew off. Then for an hour they were pretty quiet while they were holding council, except that we did some shooting with a party who had climbed up to that ledge opposite; then we saw both bands mount, and reckoned they were going to make a dash for us. We knew if they did it in earnest we must go down, for once among the rocks and bushes there would be no keeping them from mounting up. We made up our minds that the end was not far off, though I fancy we should have accounted for a good many of them before they rubbed us out. When your four rifles spoke from the ledge we thought it was a party who had gone back there, for we felt sure that we had driven them all away, but it wasn\u0027t more than a moment before we saw it wasn\u0027t that. There was no mistaking the yell of astonishment from the Indians, and as the horses swerved round we saw that three of them had fallen. You may guess we didn\u0027t stop to argue who it was, but set to work to do our share; but it seemed to us something like a miracle when the red-skins rode off. \"We had been talking of Leaping Horse during the night, for he had promised to come back to join us, and I knew him well enough to be able to bet all creation that he would come. He had only left us to keep an appointment with his nephew, who was to join him at Fort Bridger. If there had only been two guns fired we should have put it down to him, but being four I don\u0027t think either of us thought of him till he stood up and shouted. Now, lad, you had better take a sleep. We shall be moving on as soon as the moon is fairly up, and it won\u0027t be over that hill behind us till two or three. I will watch till then, but I don\u0027t think there is the least chance of their following us to-night; they have been pretty roughly handled, and I don\u0027t think they will follow until they have solved the mystery of that ledge. They searched it, no doubt, as soon as they found the rock was empty, and at daybreak they will set about tracing the trail up. That will be easy enough for them when they have once got rid of the idea that there was something uncanny about it, and then we shall have them on our heels again and on the chief\u0027s too. The first thing for us to do will be to make along the hill till we get to the edge of the ca?on, where Leaping Horse has gone for your ponies, and to follow it to its upper end.\" \"I will watch, uncle, if you will wake me in an hour. I shall be all right after a nap, but I can scarcely keep my eyes open now.\" It seemed, however, to Tom that he had not been asleep five minutes when his uncle shook him. The others were already on their feet. The moon was shining down through the trees, and with cautious steps, and taking the utmost trouble to avoid the branches, they started on their upward climb. Not a word was spoken, for all knew how far sound travels on a still night. There was, however, a slight breeze moving among the tree tops when they started, and in an hour this had so far increased that the boughs were swaying and the leaves rustling. \"I reckon there ain\u0027t no occasion to keep our mouths shut no longer,\" one of the men said. \"Now that the trees are on the move they would not hear us if they were only a hundred yards away.\" All were glad when daylight began to appear, Tom because the climbing would be much easier when the ground could be seen, the others because they were all longing for a pipe, but had hitherto not dared to light one, for the flash of a match could be seen far away. They had been bearing steadily to the right as they mounted, and shortly after daybreak they suddenly found themselves on the edge of a ca?on. \"Do you think this is the one, Jerry?\" one of the men asked. \"That is more than I can tell, Ben. I did not see an opening in the valley as we came up it, but we might very well have missed one in the dark. I should think from the distance we have gone towards the right it must be the one where we left our horses. Anyhow, whether it is or not, we must follow it up to the top and wait there for a bit to see if the chief comes.\" \"I reckon he will be there before us,\" Harry said; \"that is if he got round the red-skins all right and found the horses.
