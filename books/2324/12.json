Kaplan evidently did.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that much,\" I said. \"It\u0027s one percent of the insurance money, and that\u0027s part of the reason for hiring an investigator, isn\u0027t it? The company won\u0027t pay off until Tommy\u0027s in the clear.\"\\n\\n Kaplan looked slightly startled. \"That\u0027s true,\" he admitted, \"but I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s the reason for hiring you. The company will pay up sooner or later. I don\u0027t think your fee is necessarily high, it just seemed a disproportionately large sum to lay out in advance, and-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t argue price,\" Tommy cut in. \"The fee sounds fine to me, Matt. The only thing is, being a little short right now, and coming up with fifteen C in cash-\"\\n\\n \"Maybe your lawyer will front it to you,\" I suggested.\\n\\n Kaplan thought that was irregular. I went into the outer office while they talked it over. The receptionist was reading a copy of Fate magazine. A pair of hand-tinted etchings in antiqued frames showed scenes of nineteenth-century downtown Brooklyn. I was looking at them when Kaplan\u0027s door opened and he beckoned me back inside.\\n\\n \"Tommy\u0027s going to be able to borrow on the basis of his expectations from the insurance monies and his wife\u0027s estate,\" he said. \"Meanwhile I can let you have the fifteen hundred. I hope you have no objection to signing a receipt?\"\\n\\n \"None at all,\" I said. I counted the bills, twelve hundreds and six fifties, all circulated bills out of sequence. Everybody seems to have some cash around, even lawyers.\\n\\n He wrote out a receipt and I signed it. He apologized for what he called a little awkwardness around the subject of my fee. \"Lawyers are schooled to be very conventional human beings,\" he said. \"I sometimes have a slow reaction time when it comes to adjusting to irregular procedure. I hope I wasn\u0027t offensive.\"\\n\\n \"Not at all.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad of that. Now I won\u0027t be expecting written reports or a precise account of your movements, but you\u0027ll report to me as you go along and let me know what turns up? And please tell me too much rather than too little. It\u0027s hard to know what will prove useful.\"\\n\\n \"I know that myself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you do.\" He walked me to the door. \"And incidentally,\" he said, \"your fee is only one-half of one percent of the insurance money. I think I mentioned that the policy had a double-indemnity clause, and murder is considered accidental.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve always wondered why.\"\\n\\n Chapter 8\\n\\n The Sixty-eighth Precinct is stationed on Sixty-fifth Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, straddling the approximate boundary of Bay Ridge and Sunset Park. On the south side of the street a housing project loomed; across from it, the station house looked like something from Picasso\u0027s cubist period, all blocky with cantilevered cubes and recessed areas. The structure reminded me of the building that houses the Two-three in East Harlem, and I learned later that the same architect designed them both.\\n\\n The building was six years old then, according to the plaque in the entranceway that mentioned the architect, the police commissioner, the mayor, and a couple of other worthies making a bid for municipal immortality. I stood there and read the whole plaque as if it had a special message for me. Then I went up to the desk and said I was there to see Detective Calvin Neumann. The officer on duty made a phone call, then pointed me to the squad room.\\n\\n The building\u0027s interior was clean and spacious and well lit. It had been open enough years, though, to begin to feel like what it was.\\n\\n The squad room contained a bank of gray metal file cabinets, a row of green metal lockers, and twin rows of five-foot steel desks set back to back. A television set was on in one corner with nobody watching it. Half of the eight or ten desks were occupied. At the water cooler, a man in a suit talked with a man in his shirtsleeves. In the holding pen, a drunk sang something tuneless in Spanish.\\n\\n I recognized one of the seated detectives but couldn\u0027t recall his name. He didn\u0027t look up. Across the room, another man looked familiar. I went up to a man I didn\u0027t know and he pointed out Neumann, two desks down on the opposite side.\\n\\n He was filling in a form, and I stood while he finished what he was typing. He looked up then and said, \"Scudder?\" and pointed to a chair. He swiveled around to face me and waved a hand at the typewriter.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t tell you,\" he said, \"the hours you\u0027re gonna spend typing crud. Nobody out there realizes how much of this job is clerical.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the part it\u0027s hard to get nostalgic about.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d miss it myself.\" He yawned elaborately. \"Eddie Koehler gave you high marks,\" he said. \"I gave him a call like you suggested. He said you\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"You know Eddie?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"But I know what a lieutenant is,\" he said. \"I haven\u0027t got a whole lot to give you, but you\u0027re welcome to it. You may not get the same cooperation from Brooklyn Homicide.\"\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"They drew the case to start with. It got called in originally to the One-oh-four, which was actually wrong, it should have been ours, but that happens a lot. Then Brooklyn Homicide responded along with the One-oh-four, and they took the case away from the precinct guys.\"\\n\\n \"When did you come into it?\"\\n\\n \"When a favorite snitch of mine came up with a lot of talk coming out of the bars and bakeries on Third under the expressway. A nice mink coat at a real good price, but you got to keep this quiet because there\u0027s a lot of heat. Well, July\u0027s a funny time to sell fur coats in Sunset Park. A guy buys a coat for his seсora, he wants her to be able to wear it that night. So my guy comes to me with the impression that Miguelito Cruz has a houseful of stuff he\u0027s looking to sell and it just might be he hasn\u0027t got sales slips for many of the items. With the mink and a couple other items he mentioned, I remembered the Tillary job on Colonial Road, and it was enough to get a judge to issue a search warrant.\"\\n\\n He ran a hand through his hair. It was medium brown, lighter where the sun had bleached it, and it was on the shaggy side. Cops were starting to wear their hair a little longer around about then, and the younger ones were beginning to show up in beards and moustaches. Neumann, though, was clean-shaven, his features regular except for a nose that had been broken and imperfectly reset.\\n\\n \"The stuff was in Cruz\u0027s house,\" he said. \"He lives over on Fifty-first, the other side of the Gowanus Expressway. I have the address somewhere if you want it. Those are some pretty blighted blocks over by the Bush Terminal Warehouse, if you know where that is. A lot of empty lots and boarded-up buildings and others nobody bothered boarding up, or somebody opened them up again and there\u0027s junkies camped out there. Where Cruz lived wasn\u0027t so bad. You\u0027ll see it if you go over there.\"\\n\\n \"He live alone?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"With his abuela. His grandmother. Little old lady, doesn\u0027t speak English, she probably ought to be in a home. Maybe they\u0027ll take her in at the Marien-Heim, it\u0027s right in the neighborhood. Old lady comes here from Puerto Rico, before she can learn English she winds up in a home with a German name. That\u0027s New York, right?\"\\n\\n \"You found Tillary\u0027s possessions in the Cruz apartment?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah. No question. I mean the serial numbers matched on the record player. He tried to deny it. What else is new, right? \u0027Oh, I buy dis stuff on de street, it was some guy I met in a bar. I doan know hees name.\u0027 We told him, sure, Miguelito, but meanwhile a woman got cut bad in the house this stuff came out of, so it sure looks like you\u0027re gonna go away for murder one. The next minute he\u0027s copping to the burglary but insisting there was no dead woman when he was there.\"\\n\\n \"He must have known a woman got killed there.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, no matter who killed her. It was in the papers, right? One minute he says he didn\u0027t see the story, the next minute he didn\u0027t happen to recognize the address, you know how their stories keep changing.\"\\n\\n \"Where does Herrera come in?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re cousins or something. Herrera lives in a furnished room on Forty-eighth between Fifth and Sixth just a couple of blocks from the park. Lived there, anyway. Right now they\u0027re both living at the Brooklyn House of Detention and they\u0027ll be living there until they move upstate.\"\\n\\n \"They both have sheets?\"\\n\\n \"Be a surprise if they didn\u0027t, wouldn\u0027t it?\" He grinned. \"They\u0027re your typical fuckups. A few juvenile arrests for gang stuff. They both beat a burglary charge a year and a half ago, a judge ruled there wasn\u0027t probable cause to justify a frisk.\" He shook his head. \"The fucking rules you have to play by. Anyway, they beat that one, and another time they got collared for burglary and plea-bargained it to criminal trespass and got suspended sentences for it. And another time, another burglary case, the evidence disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"It disappeared?\"\\n\\n \"It got lost or misfiled or something, I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s a miracle anybody ever goes to jail in this city. You really need a death wish to wind up in prison.\"\\n\\n \"So they did a fair amount of burglary.\"\\n\\n \"It looks like. In-and-out stuff, nickel-and-dime crap. Kick the door in, grab a radio, run into the street and sell it on the street for five or ten dollars. Cruz was worse than Herrera. Herrera worked from time to time, pushing a hand truck in the garment center or delivering lunches, minimum-wage stuff. I don\u0027t think Miguelito ever held a job.\"\\n\\n \"But neither of them ever killed anybody before.\"\\n\\n \"Cruz did.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"In a tavern fight, him and another asshole fighting over some woman.\"\\n\\n \"The papers didn\u0027t have that.\"\\n\\n \"It never got to court. There were no charges pressed. There were a dozen witnesses reporting that the dead guy went after Cruz first with a broken bottle.\"\\n\\n \"What weapon did Cruz use?\"\\n\\n \"A knife. He said it wasn\u0027t his, and there were witnesses prepared to swear they\u0027d seen somebody toss him the knife. And of course they hadn\u0027t happened to notice who it was did the tossing. We didn\u0027t have enough to make a case of weapon possession, let alone homicide.\"\\n\\n \"But Cruz normally carried a knife?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d be more likely to catch him leaving the house without underwear.\"\\n\\n THAT was early afternoon, the day after I\u0027d taken fifteen hundred dollars from Drew Kaplan. That morning I\u0027d bought a money order and mailed it to Syosset. I paid my August rent in advance, settled a bar tab or two, and rode the BMT to Sunset Park.\\n\\n It\u0027s in Brooklyn, of course, on the borough\u0027s western edge, above Bay Ridge and south and west of Green-Wood Cemetery. These days there\u0027s a fair amount of brownstoning going on in Sunset Park, with young urban professionals fleeing the Manhattan rents and renovating the old row houses, gentrifying the neighborhood. Back then the upwardly mobile young had not yet discovered the place, and the population was a mixture of Latins and Scandinavians. Most of the former were Puerto Ricans, most of the latter Norwegians, and the balance was gradually shifting from Europe to the islands, from light to dark, but this was a process that had been going on for ages and there was nothing hurried about it.\\n\\n I\u0027d walked around some before my visit to the Six-eight, keeping mostly within a block or so of Fourth Avenue, the main commercial thoroughfare, and orienting myself intermittently by looking around for Saint Michael\u0027s Church. Few of the buildings stood more than three stories, and the egg-shaped church dome, set atop a two-hundred-foot tower, was visible a long ways off. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-12.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
