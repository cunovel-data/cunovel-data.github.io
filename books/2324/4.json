{"id":63062,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"A couple of years previously, my world had narrowed as if with a will of its own until it encompassed only a few square blocks south and west of Columbus Circle. I had left my marriage after a dozen years and two children, moving from Syosset, which is on Long Island, to my hotel, which was on West Fifty-seventh Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. I had at about the same time left the New York Police Department, where I\u0027d put in about as many years with about as much to show for it. I supported myself, and sent checks irregularly to Syosset, by doing things for people. I was not a private detective- private detectives are licensed and fill out reports and file tax returns. So I did favors for people, and they gave me money, and my rent always got paid and there was always money for booze, and intermittently I was able to put a check in the mail for Anita and the boys. My world, as I said, had shrunk geographically, and within that area it confined itself largely to the room where I slept and the bars where I spent most of my waking hours. There was Morrissey\u0027s, but not all that often. I was off to bed more often than not by one or two, sometimes hung on until the bars closed, and only rarely went to an after-hours and made a full night of it. There was Miss Kitty\u0027s, Skip Devoe\u0027s place. On the same block as my hotel, there was Polly\u0027s Cage, with its red-flocked bordello wallpaper and its crowd of after-work drinkers who thinned out by ten or ten-thirty; and McGovern\u0027s, a drab narrow room with unshielded overhead lights and customers who never said a word. I stopped in sometimes for a quick drink on a hard morning, and the bartender\u0027s hand shook when he poured it, as often as not. On the same block there were two French restaurants, one next to the other. One of them, Mont-St.-Michel, was always three-quarters empty. I took women there for dinner a few times over the years, and stopped in alone once in a while for a drink at the bar. The establishment next door had a good reputation and did a better business, but I don\u0027t think I ever set foot inside it. There was a place over on Tenth Avenue called the Slate; they got a lot of cops from Midtown North and John Jay College, and I went there when I was in the mood for that kind of crowd. The steaks were good there, and the surroundings comfortable. There was a Martin\u0027s Bar on Broadway and Sixtieth with low-priced drinks and good corned beef and ham on the steam table; they had a big color set over the bar, and it wasn\u0027t a bad place to watch a ball game. There was O\u0027Neal\u0027s Baloon across from Lincoln Center - an old law still on the books that year prohibited calling a place a saloon, and they didn\u0027t know that when they ordered the sign, so they changed the first letter and said the hell with it. I\u0027d stop in once in a while during the afternoon, but it was too trendy and upbeat at night. There was Antares and Spiro\u0027s, a Greek place at the corner of Ninth and Fifty-seventh. Not really my kind of place, a lot of guys with bushy moustaches drinking ouzo, but I passed it every night on the way home and sometimes I\u0027d stop in for a quick one. There was the all-night newsstand at the corner of Fifty-seventh and Eighth. I generally bought the paper there, unless I bought it from the shopping-bag lady who hawked them on the sidewalk in front of the 400 Deli. She bought them for a quarter each from the newsstand- I think they were all a quarter that year, or maybe the News was twenty cents- and she sold them for the same price, which is a tough way to make a living. Sometimes I\u0027d give her a buck and tell her to keep the change. Her name was Mary Alice Redfield, but I never knew that until a couple of years later, when someone stabbed her to death. There was a coffee shop called the Red Flame and there was the 400 Deli. There were a couple of okay pizza stands, and there was a place that sold cheese steaks that nobody ever went to twice. There was a spaghetti joint called Ralph\u0027s and a couple of Chinese restaurants. There was a Thai place that Skip Devoe was crazy about. There was Joey Farrell\u0027s on Fifty-eighth Street - they\u0027d just opened the past winter. There was, hell, there were a lot of joints. Mostly there was Armstrong\u0027s. Christ, I lived there. I had my room to sleep in and I had other bars and restaurants to go to, but for a few years there, Jimmy Armstrong\u0027s was home to me. People who were looking for me knew to check for me there, and sometimes they called Armstrong\u0027s before they called the hotel. The place opened up around eleven, with a Filipino kid named Dennis behind the stick days. Billie Keegan took over around seven and closed at two or three or four, depending on the crowd and how he was feeling. (That was the weekday routine. There were different day and night bartenders on weekends, and the turnover among them was high.) Waitresses came and went. They got acting jobs or broke up with their boyfriends or got new boyfriends or moved to Los Angeles or went home to Sioux Falls or had a fight with the Dominican kid in the kitchen or got fired for stealing or quit or got pregnant. Jimmy himself wasn\u0027t around much that summer. I think that was the year he was looking to buy land in North Carolina. What can I say about the place? A long bar on the right hand side as you came in, tables on the left. Blue-checkered cloths on them. Dark wood-paneled walls. Pictures on the walls, and framed advertisements from old magazines. A deer\u0027s head was mounted incongruously on the back wall; my favorite table was right under the thing, so I didn\u0027t have to look at it. The crowd was a mixed bag. Doctors and nurses from Roosevelt Hospital across the street. Professors and students from Fordham. People from the television studios- CBS was a block away, and ABC a short walk. And people who lived nearby, or kept shops in the neighborhood. A couple of classical musicians. A writer. Two Lebanese brothers who had just opened a shoe store. Not many kids. When I first moved into the neighborhood Armstrong\u0027s had a jukebox with a nice selection of jazz and country blues, but Jimmy took it out early on and replaced it with a stereo system and classical music on tape. That kept the younger crowd out, to the delight of the waitresses who hated the kids for staying late, ordering little, and tipping hardly at all. It also kept the noise level down and made the room more suitable for long-haul maintenance drinking. Which was what I was there for. I wanted to keep an edge on but I didn\u0027t want to get drunk, except once in a while. I mostly mixed my bourbon with coffee, moving to straight booze toward the end of an evening. I could read a paper there, and have a hamburger or a full meal, and as much or as little conversation as I was in the mood for. I wasn\u0027t always there all day and night, but it was a rare day that I didn\u0027t get in the door at least once, and some days I got there a few minutes after Dennis opened up and was still there when Billie was ready to close. Everybody\u0027s got to be someplace. SALOON friends. I got to know Tommy Tillary in Armstrong\u0027s. He was a regular, apt to turn up three or four nights out of seven. I don\u0027t recall the first time I was aware of him, but it was hard to be in a room with him and not notice him. He was a big fellow and his voice tended to carry. He wasn\u0027t raucous, but after a few drinks his voice filled a room. He ate a lot of beef and drank a lot of Chivas Regal, and they both showed in his face. He must have been close to forty-five. He was getting jowly, and his cheeks were blooming with a tracery of broken capillaries. I never knew why they called him Tough Tommy. Perhaps Skip was right, perhaps the name\u0027s intent was ironic. They called him Tommy Telephone because of his job. He worked in telephone sales, peddling investments over the phone from a bucket shop in the Wall Street area. I understand people change jobs a lot in that line of work. The ability to coax investment dollars out of strangers over a telephone line is a rather special talent, and its possessors can get work readily, moving from one employer to another at will. That summer, Tommy was working for an outfit called Tannahill \u0026 Company, selling limited partnerships in real-estate syndications. There were tax advantages, I gather, and the prospect of capital gains. I picked this up inferentially, because Tommy never pitched anything, to me or anyone else at the bar. I was there one time when an obstetrics resident from Roosevelt tried to ask him about his offerings. Tommy brushed him off with a joke. \"No, I\u0027m serious,\" the doctor insisted. \"I\u0027m finally making a buck, I ought to start thinking about things like that.\" Tommy shrugged. \"You got a card?\" The doctor didn\u0027t. \"Then write your phone on this and a good time to call you. You want a pitch, I\u0027ll call you and give you the full treatment. But I got to warn you, I\u0027m irresistible over the phone.\" A couple of weeks later they ran into each other and the resident complained that Tommy hadn\u0027t called him. \"Jesus, I been meaning to,\" Tommy said. \"First thing, I\u0027ll make a note of it now.\" He was acceptable company. He told dialect jokes and he told them reasonably well, and I laughed at my share of them. I suppose some of them were offensive, but they weren\u0027t often mean-spirited. If I was in a mood to reminisce about my days on the force, he was a good enough listener, and if the story I told was a funny one his laugh was as loud as anybody\u0027s. He was, on balance, a little too loud and a little too cheery. He talked a little too much and he could get on your nerves. As I said, he\u0027d turn up at Armstrong\u0027s three or four nights a week, and about half the time she was with him. Carolyn Cheatham, Carolyn from the Caro-line, with a soft you-all accent that, like certain culinary herbs, became stronger when you steeped it in alcohol. Sometimes she came in on his arm. Other times he\u0027d get there first and she\u0027d join him. She lived in the neighborhood and she and Tommy worked in the same office, and I figured- if I bothered to think about it- that the office romance had served to introduce Tommy to Armstrong\u0027s. He followed sports. He bet with a bookie- mostly ball games, sometimes horses- and he let you know when he won. He was a little too friendly, a little too indiscriminately friendly, and sometimes there was a chill in his eyes that belied the friendship in his voice. He had cold little eyes, and there was a softening around his mouth, a weakness there, but none of that got into his voice. You could see how he\u0027d be good over the phone. SKIP Devoe\u0027s first name was Arthur, but Bobby Ruslander was the only person I ever heard call him that. Bobby could get away with it. They\u0027d been friends since fourth grade, they grew up on the same block in Jackson Heights. Skip had been christened Arthur Jr., and he\u0027d acquired the nickname early on. \"Because he used to skip school all the time,\" Bobby said, but Skip had another explanation. \"I had this uncle was in the navy and never got over it,\" he told me once. \"My mother\u0027s brother. Bought me sailor suits, toy boats. I had this whole fleet and he called me Skipper, and pretty soon so did everybody else. Coulda been worse. There was a guy in our class everybody called Worm. Don\u0027t ask me why. Imagine if they still call him that. He\u0027s in bed with his wife: \u0027Oh, Wormy, put it in deeper.\u0027 \" He was around thirty-four, thirty-five, about my height but lean and muscular. The veins showed on his forearms and the backs of his hands. There was no spare flesh on his face, and the skin followed the curve of the bone, giving him deeply sculpted cheeks. He had a hawk nose and piercing blue eyes that showed a little green under the right lighting. All of this combined with assurance and an easy manner to make him quite attractive to women, and he rarely had trouble finding a girl to go home with when he wanted one. But he was living alone and not keeping steady company with anyone, and seemed to prefer the regular company of other men. He had either lived with or been married to someone and it had ended a few years ago, and he seemed disinclined to get involved with anyone else.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-4.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
