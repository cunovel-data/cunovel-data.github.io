I never smoked so I never had to quit, but he quit and then it was one thing after another. He lost a lot of weight, he changed his diet, he started jogging. He looked terrible, he looked all drawn, you know how guys get? But he was happy, he was really pleased with himself. Wouldn\u0027t go drinking, just order one beer and make it last, or he\u0027d have one and then switch to club soda. The French stuff. Perrier?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Very popular all of a sudden, it\u0027s plain soda water and it costs more than beer. Figure it out and explain it to me sometime. He shot himself.\" \"O\u0027Bannon?\" \"Yeah. I don\u0027t mean it\u0027s connected, losing the weight and drinking club soda and killing himself. The life you lead and the things you see, I\u0027ll tell you, a cop goes and eats his gun, I never figure it requires an explanation. You know what I mean?\" \"I know what you mean.\" He looked at me. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Course you do.\" And then the conversation took a turn in another direction, and a little while later, with a slab of hot apple pie topped with cheddar in front of Diebold and coffee poured for both of us, he returned to the subject of Tommy Tillary, identifying him as my friend. \"Sort of a friend,\" I said. \"I know him around the bars.\" \"Right, she lives up in your neighborhood, doesn\u0027t she? The girlfriend, I forget her name.\" \"Carolyn Cheatham.\" \"I wish she was all the alibi he had. But even if he got away from her for a few hours, what was the wife doing during the burglary? Waiting for Tommy to come home and kill her? I mean, take it to extremes, say she hides under the bed while they rifle the bedroom and get their prints on everything. They leave, she calls the cops, right?\" \"He couldn\u0027t have killed her.\" \"I know, and it drives me crazy. How come you like him?\" \"He\u0027s not a bad guy. And I\u0027m getting paid for this, Jack. I\u0027m doing him a favor, but it\u0027s one I\u0027m getting paid for. And it\u0027s a waste of my time and his money anyway, because you haven\u0027t got a case against him.\" \"No.\" \"You don\u0027t, do you?\" \"Not even close.\" He ate some pie, drank some coffee. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re getting paid. Not just because I like to see a guy turn a buck. I\u0027d hate to see you bust your balls for him for free.\" \"I\u0027m not busting anything.\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"Am I missing something, Jack?\" \"Huh?\" \"What did he do, steal baseballs from the Police Athletic League? How come you\u0027ve got the red ass for him?\" He thought it over. His jaws worked. He frowned. \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you,\" he said at length. \"He\u0027s a phony.\" \"He sells stock and shit over the phone. Of course he\u0027s a phony.\" \"More than that. I don\u0027t know how to explain it so it makes sense, but shit, you were a cop. You know how you get feelings.\" \"Of course.\" \"Well, I get a feeling with that guy. There\u0027s something about him that\u0027s wrong, something about her death.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is,\" I said. \"He\u0027s glad she\u0027s dead and he\u0027s pretending he isn\u0027t. It gets him out of a jam and he\u0027s glad, but he\u0027s acting like a sanctimonious son of a bitch and that\u0027s what you\u0027re responding to.\" \"Maybe that\u0027s part of it.\" \"I think it\u0027s the whole thing. You\u0027re sensing that he\u0027s acting guilty. Well, he is. He feels guilty. He\u0027s glad she\u0027s dead, but at the same time he lived with the woman for I forget how many years, he had a life with her, part of him was busy being a husband while the other part was running around on her-\" \"Yeah, yeah, I follow you.\" \"So?\" \"It\u0027s more than that.\" \"Why does it have to be more? Look, maybe he did set up Cruz and whatsisname-\" \"Hernandez.\" \"No, not Hernandez. What the hell\u0027s his name?\" \"Angel. Angel eyes.\" \"Herrera. Maybe he set them up to go in, rob the place. Maybe he even had it in the back of his mind she might get in the way.\" \"Keep going.\" \"Except it\u0027s too iffy, isn\u0027t it? I think he just feels guilty for wishing she\u0027d get killed, or being glad of it after the fact, and you\u0027re picking up on the guilt and that\u0027s why you like him for the murder.\" \"No.\" \"You sure?\" \"I\u0027m not sure that I\u0027m sure of anything. You know, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re gettin\u0027 paid. I hope you\u0027re costin\u0027 him a ton.\" \"Not all that much.\" \"Well, soak him all you can. Because at least it\u0027s costin\u0027 him money, even if that\u0027s all it\u0027s costin\u0027 him, and it\u0027s money he doesn\u0027t have to pay. Because we can\u0027t touch him. Even if those two changed their story, admitted the killing and said he put \u0027em up to it, that\u0027s not enough to put him away. And they\u0027re not gonna change their story, and who would ever hire them to commit murder anyway, and they wouldn\u0027t take a contract like that. I know they wouldn\u0027t. Cruz is a mean little bastard but Herrera\u0027s just a stupid guy, and- aw, shit.\" \"What?\" \"It just kills me to see him get away with it.\" \"But he didn\u0027t do it, Jack.\" \"He\u0027s gettin\u0027 away with something,\" he said, \"and I hate to see it happen. You know what I hope? I hope he runs a red light sometime, in that fucking boat of his. What\u0027s it, a Buick he\u0027s got?\" \"I think so.\" \"I hope he runs a light and I tag him for it, that\u0027s what I hope.\" \"Is that what Brooklyn Homicide does these days? A lot of traffic detail?\" \"I just hope it happens,\" he said. \"That\u0027s all.\" Chapter 12 Diebold insisted on driving me home. When I offered to take the subway he told me not to be ridiculous, that it was midnight already and I was in no condition for public transportation. \"You\u0027ll pass out,\" he said, \"and some bum\u0027ll steal the shoes off your feet.\" He was probably right. As it was I nodded off during the ride back to Manhattan, coming awake when he pulled up at the corner of Fifty-seventh and Ninth. I thanked him for the ride, asked him if he had time for a drink before he went back. \"Hey, enough\u0027s enough,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t go all night like I used to.\" \"You know, I think I\u0027ll call it a night myself,\" I said. But I didn\u0027t. I watched him pull away, started walking to my hotel, then turned and went around the corner to Armstrong\u0027s. The place was mostly empty. I went in, and Billie gave me a wave. I went up to the bar. And she was there at the end of the bar, all alone, staring down into the glass on the bar in front of her. Carolyn Cheatham. I hadn\u0027t seen her since the night I\u0027d gone home with her. While I was trying to decide whether or not to say anything, she looked up and her eyes met mine. Her face was frozen with stubborn old pain. It took her a blink or two to recognize me, and when she did a muscle worked in her cheek and tears started to form in the corners of her eyes. She used the back of her hand to wipe them away. She\u0027d been crying earlier; there was a tissue crumpled on the bar, black with mascara. \"My bourbon-drinking friend,\" she said. \"Billie,\" she said, \"this man is a gentleman. Will you please bring my gentleman friend a drink of good bourbon?\" Billie looked at me. I nodded. He brought a couple of ounces of bourbon and a mug of black coffee. \"I called you my gentleman friend,\" Carolyn Cheatham said, \"but that has an unintentional connotation.\" She pronounced her words with a drunk\u0027s deliberate care. \"You are a gentleman and a friend, but not a gentleman friend. My gentleman friend, on the other hand, is neither.\" I drank some of the bourbon, poured some of it into the coffee. \"Billie,\" she said, \"do you know how you can tell that Mr. Scudder is a gentleman?\" \"He always removes his lady in the presence of a hat.\" \"He is a bourbon drinker,\" she said. \"That makes him a gentleman, huh, Carolyn?\" \"It makes him a far cry removed from a hypocritical scotch-drinking son of a bitch.\" She didn\u0027t speak in a loud voice, but there was enough edge to her words to shut down conversations across the room. There were only three or four tables occupied, and the people sitting at them all picked the same instant to stop talking. For a moment the taped music was startlingly audible. It was one of the few pieces I could identify, one of the Brandenburg concertos. They played it so often there that even I was now able to tell what it was. Then Billie said, \"Suppose a man drinks Irish whiskey, Carolyn. What does that make him?\" \"An Irishman,\" she said. \"Makes sense.\" \"I\u0027m drinking bourbon,\" she said, and shoved her glass forward a significant inch. \"God damn it, I\u0027m a lady.\" He looked at her, then looked at me. I nodded, and he shrugged and poured for her. \"On me,\" I said. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"Thank you, Matthew.\" And her eyes started to water, and she dug a fresh tissue from her bag. She wanted to talk about Tommy. He was being nice to her, she said. Calling up, sending flowers. But it just wouldn\u0027t do if she made a scene around the office, and he just might have to testify how he spent the night his wife was killed, and he had to keep on the good side of her for the time being. But he wouldn\u0027t see her because it wouldn\u0027t look right. Not for a new widower, not for a man who\u0027d been virtually accused of complicity in his wife\u0027s death. \"He sends flowers with no card enclosed,\" she said. \"He calls me from pay phones. The son of a bitch.\" \"Maybe the florist forgot to enclose a card.\" \"Oh, Matt. Don\u0027t make excuses for him.\" \"And he\u0027s in a hotel, of course he would use a pay phone.\" \"He could call from his room. He as much as said he didn\u0027t want the call to go through the hotel switchboard, in case the operator\u0027s listening in. There was no card with the flowers because he doesn\u0027t want anything in writing. He came to my apartment the other night, but he won\u0027t be seen with me, he won\u0027t go out with me, and- oh, the hypocrite. The scotch-drinking son of a bitch.\" Billie called me aside. \"I didn\u0027t want to put her out,\" he said, \"a nice woman like that, shitfaced as she is. But I thought I was gonna have to. You\u0027ll see she gets home?\" \"Sure.\" First I had to let her buy us another round. She insisted. Then I got her out of there and walked her around the corner to her building. There was rain coming, you could smell it in the air, and when we went from Armstrong\u0027s air conditioning into the sultry humidity that heralds a summer storm it took some of the spirit out of her. She held my arm as we walked, gripped it with something on the edge of desperation. In the elevator she sagged against the back panel and braced her feet. \"Oh, God,\" she said. I took the keys from her and unlocked her door. I got her inside. She half sat, half sprawled on the couch. Her eyes were open but I don\u0027t know if she saw much through them. I had to use the bathroom, and when I came back her eyes were closed and she was snoring lightly. I got her shoes off, moved her to a chair, struggled with the couch until I managed to open it into a bed. I put her on it. I figured I ought to loosen her clothing, and while I was at it I undressed her completely. She remained unconscious throughout the operation, and I remembered what a mortician\u0027s assistant had told me once about the difficulty of dressing and undressing the dead. My gorge rose at the image and I thought I was going to be sick, but I sat down and my stomach settled itself.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-17.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
