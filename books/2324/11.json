{"id":63069,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Not so it amounts to anything,\" Tommy put in.\n \"I\u0027m telling it the way the cops would tell it, all right? He owes some money around town, he\u0027s a couple of payments behind with the Buick. Meanwhile he\u0027s putting away this girl at the office, bouncing around the bars with her, sometimes not making it home altogether-\"\n \"Hardly ever, Drew. I\u0027d almost always make it home, an\u0027 if I couldn\u0027t grab a few hours in the sack I\u0027d at least shower and change and have breakfast with Peg.\"\n \"What was breakfast? Dexamyl?\"\n \"Sometimes. I had an office to go to, a job to do.\"\n Kaplan sat on a corner of his desk, crossed his legs at the ankle. \"That\u0027ll do for motive,\" he said. \"What they don\u0027t bother to notice is a couple of things. One, he loved his wife, and how many husbands cheat? What is it they say? Ninety percent admit they cheat and ten percent lie about it? Two, he\u0027s got debts but he\u0027s not in a crunch. He\u0027s a guy makes good money over the year but he runs hot and cold, and for years he\u0027s been fat one month and strapped the next.\"\n \"You get used to it,\" Tommy said.\n \"Plus the numbers sound like a fortune, but they\u0027re not unusual figures. A half-million is substantial, but as Tommy said it won\u0027t net out to that much after taxes, and part of it consists of title to the house he\u0027s been occupying for years. A hundred fifty thousand dollars\u0027 insurance on a breadwinner isn\u0027t high by any means, and having the same coverage on the wife isn\u0027t uncommon, a lot of insurance agents try to write policies that way. They make it sound logically balanced, so you overlook the fact that you don\u0027t really need that kind of coverage on someone you don\u0027t depend upon for income.\" He spread his hands. \"Anyway, the policies were taken out over ten years ago. This isn\u0027t something he went and set up last week.\"\n He stood up, walked over to the window. Tommy had picked up the railway spike from the desk and was playing with it, slapping it against the palm of his hand, consciously or unconsciously matching the rhythm of the clock\u0027s pendulum.\n Kaplan said, \"One of the killers, Angel Herrera, except I suppose he pronounces it Ahn-hell, did some odd jobs at the Tillary house last March or April. Spring cleaning, he hauled stuff out of the basement and attic, did a little donkey work for hourly wages. According to Herrera, that\u0027s how Tommy knew to contact him to fake the burglary. According to common sense, that\u0027s how Herrera and his buddy Cruz knew the house and what was in it and how to gain access.\"\n \"How\u0027d they do that?\"\n \"Broke a small pane in the side door, reached in and unlocked it. Their story is Tommy left it open for them and must have broken the glass after. It\u0027s also their story that they left the place relatively neat.\"\n \"Looked like a cyclone hit it,\" Tommy said. \"I had to go there. Made me sick to look at it.\"\n \"Their story is Tommy did that the same time he was murdering his wife. Except none of this works out if you take a good look at it. The times are all wrong. They went in around midnight, and the medical examiner places the time of death at between ten P.M. and four A.M. Now Tommy here never made it home from the office that evening. He worked past five, he met his friend for dinner, and he was with her in a variety of public places over the course of the evening.\" He looked over at his client. \"We\u0027re lucky he\u0027s not much on discretion. His alibi\u0027d be a whole lot thinner if he\u0027d spent every minute in her apartment with the blinds drawn.\"\n \"I was discreet as far as Peg was concerned,\" Tommy said. \"In Brooklyn I was a family man. What I did in the city never hurt her.\"\n \"After midnight his time\u0027s harder to account for,\" Kaplan went on. \"The only substantiation for some of those hours is the girlfriend, because for a while they were in her apartment with the blinds drawn.\"\n You didn\u0027t have to draw the blinds, I thought. Nobody could see in.\n \"Plus there was some time she couldn\u0027t account for.\"\n \"She fell asleep and I couldn\u0027t,\" Tommy said, \"so I got dressed and went out for a couple of pops. But I wasn\u0027t gone that long, and she woke up when I got back. I had a helicopter, maybe I coulda got to Bay Ridge\u0027n\u0027 back in that amount of time. Never do it in a Buick.\"\n \"The thing is,\" Kaplan said, \"even supposing there was time, or discounting the girlfriend\u0027s alibi altogether and only accepting the times substantiated by unbiased witnesses, how could he possibly have done it? Say he sneaks home sometime after the Spanish kids have paid their visit and before four A.M., which was the latest the murder could have taken place. Where was she all this time? According to Cruz and Herrera, there was nobody home. Well, where did he find her to kill her? What did he do, haul her around in the trunk all night?\"\n \"Let\u0027s say he killed her before they got there,\" I suggested.\n \"And I\u0027m lookin\u0027 to hire this guy,\" Tommy said. \"I got an instinct, you know what I mean?\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t work,\" Kaplan said. \"In the first place the times simply won\u0027t fit. He\u0027s alibied solid from before eight until past midnight, out in public with the girl. The M.E. says she was definitely alive at ten, that\u0027s the absolute earliest she could have been killed. Plus even forgetting the times it doesn\u0027t work. How could they go in, rob the whole house, and not see a dead woman in the bedroom? They were in that room, they were in possession of stolen articles from that room, I think they even found prints in there. Well, the police found the corpse of Margaret Tillary in that room, too, and it\u0027s the sort of thing they probably would have noticed.\"\n \"Maybe the body was covered up.\" I thought of Skip\u0027s big Mosler safe. \"Locked in a closet they didn\u0027t look in.\"\n He shook his head. \"The cause of death was stabbing. There was a lot of blood and it was all over the place. The bed was soaked, the bedroom carpet.\" We both avoided looking at Tommy. \"So she wasn\u0027t killed elsewhere,\" he concluded. \"She was killed right there, and if it wasn\u0027t Herrera did it it was Cruz, and either way it wasn\u0027t Tommy.\"\n I looked for a hole in it and couldn\u0027t find one. \"Then I don\u0027t see what you need me for,\" I said. \"The case against Tommy sounds pretty thin.\"\n \"So thin there isn\u0027t any case.\"\n \"Then-\"\n \"The thing is,\" he said, \"you get near a courtroom with something like this and even if you win you still lose. Because for the rest of your life all everybody remembers about you is you once stood trial for murdering your wife. Never mind that you won an acquittal. Everybody just figures some Jew lawyer bought a judge or conned a jury.\"\n \"So I\u0027ll get a guinea lawyer,\" Tommy said, \"and they\u0027ll think he threatened the judge and beat up the jury.\"\n \"Besides,\" Kaplan said, \"you never know which way a jury\u0027s going to jump. Remember, Tommy\u0027s alibi is he was with another woman at the time of the burglary. The woman\u0027s a colleague, they could choose to regard it as completely aboveboard, but did you see the piece in the Post? What juries\u0027ll go and do, they decide they don\u0027t believe the alibi because it\u0027s your girlfriend lying for you, and at the same time they label you a scumbag for getting your carrot scraped while your wife\u0027s getting killed.\"\n \"You keep it up,\" Tommy said, \"I\u0027ll find my own self guilty, the way you make it sound.\"\n \"Plus he\u0027s hard to get a sympathetic jury for. He\u0027s a big handsome guy, a sharp dresser, and you\u0027d love him in a gin joint but how much do you love him in a courtroom? He\u0027s a telephone securities salesman, perfectly respectable thing to be, calls you up, advises you how to invest your money. Fine. That means every clown who ever lost a hundred dollars on a stock tip or bought magazine subscriptions over the phone is going to walk into the courtroom with a hardon for him. I\u0027m telling you, I want to stay the hell out of court. I\u0027ll win in court, I know that, or worse comes to worst I\u0027ll win on appeal, but who needs it? This is a case that shouldn\u0027t be in the first place, and what I\u0027d love is to clear it up before they even go so far as presenting a bill to the grand jury.\"\n \"So from me you want-\"\n \"Whatever you can find out, Matt. Whatever discredits Cruz and Herrera. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s there to find. I\u0027d love it if you could find blood, their clothes with stains on it, anything like that. The point is that I don\u0027t know what\u0027s there to be found, and you were a cop and now you\u0027re working private, and you can get down in the streets and the bars and nose around. You familiar with Brooklyn?\"\n \"Parts of it. I worked over here, off and on.\"\n \"So you can find your way around.\"\n \"Well enough. But wouldn\u0027t you be better off with a Spanish-speaker? I know enough to buy a beer in a bodega, but I\u0027m a long way from fluent.\"\n \"Tommy says he wants somebody he can trust, and he was very adamant about calling you in. I think he\u0027s right. A personal relationship\u0027s worth more than a dime\u0027s worth of \u0027Me llamo Matteo y como estб usted?\u0027 \"\n \"That\u0027s the truth,\" Tommy Tillary said. \"Matt, I know I can count on you, and that\u0027s worth a lot.\"\n I wanted to tell him all he could count on were his fingers, but why was I trying to talk myself out of a fee? His money was as good as anybody else\u0027s. I wasn\u0027t sure I liked him, but I was just as happy not to like the men I worked for. It bothered me less that way if I felt I was giving them less than full value.\n And I didn\u0027t see how I could give him much. The case against him sounded loose enough to fall apart without my help. I wondered if Kaplan just wanted to create some activity to justify a high fee of his own, in the event that the whole thing blew itself out in a week\u0027s time. That was possible, and that wasn\u0027t my problem, either.\n I said I would be glad to help. I said I hoped I would be able to come up with something useful.\n Tommy said he was sure I could.\n Drew Kaplan said, \"Now you\u0027ll want a retainer. I suppose that\u0027ll be an advance against a per diem fee plus expenses, or do you bill at hourly rates? Why are you shaking your head?\"\n \"I\u0027m unlicensed,\" I said. \"I have no official standing.\"\n \"That\u0027s no problem. We can carry you on the books as a consultant.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to be on the books at all,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t keep track of my time or expenses. I pay my own expenses out of my own pocket. I get paid in cash.\"\n \"How do you set your fees?\"\n \"I think up a number. If I think I should have more coming when I\u0027m finished, I say so. If you disagree, you don\u0027t have to pay me. I\u0027m not going to take anybody to court.\"\n \"It seems a haphazard way to do business,\" Kaplan said.\n \"It\u0027s not a business. I do favors for friends.\"\n \"And take money for them.\"\n \"Is there anything wrong with taking money for a favor?\"\n \"I don\u0027t suppose there is.\" He looked thoughtful. \"How much would you expect for this favor?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s involved,\" I said. \"Suppose you let me have fifteen hundred dollars today. If things drag on and I feel entitled to more, I\u0027ll let you know.\"\n \"Fifteen hundred. And of course Tommy doesn\u0027t know exactly what he\u0027s getting for that.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"Neither do I.\"\n Kaplan narrowed his eyes. \"That seems high for a retainer,\" he said. \"I\u0027d have thought a third of that would be ample for starters.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-11.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: \n When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
