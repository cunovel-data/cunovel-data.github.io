{"id":63066,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"All that\u0027s still a long ways off.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose.\" He looked thoughtfully at his cigarette, drowned it in the dregs of his beer. \"I hate it when they do that,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Send back glasses with butts floating in them. Disgusting.\" He looked at me, his eyes probing mine. \"Anything you can do for me on this? I mean for hire.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see what. Not at this point.\"\\n\\n \"So in the meantime I just wait. That\u0027s always the hard part for me, always has been. I ran track in high school, the quarter-mile. I was lighter then. I smoked heavy, I smoked since I was thirteen, but you can do anything at that age and it doesn\u0027t touch you. Nothing touches kids, that\u0027s why they all think they\u0027re gonna live forever.\" He drew another cigarette halfway out of the pack, put it back again. \"I loved the races, but waiting for the event to start, I hated that. Some guys would puke. I never puked but I used to feel like it. I would pee and then I\u0027d think I had to pee again five minutes later.\" He shook his head at the memory. \"And the same thing overseas, waiting to go into combat. I never minded combat, and there was a lot about it to mind. Things that bother me now, remembering them, but while they were going on it was a different story.\"\\n\\n \"I can understand that.\"\\n\\n \"Waiting, though, that was murder.\" He pushed his chair back. \"What do I owe you, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"For what? I didn\u0027t do anything.\"\\n\\n \"For the advice.\"\\n\\n I waved the thought away. \"You can buy me that drink,\" I said, \"and that\u0027ll be fine.\"\\n\\n \"Done,\" he said. He stood up. \"I may need a hand from you somewhere down the line.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said.\\n\\n He stopped to talk to Dennis on the way out. I nursed my coffee. By the time I was done with it a woman two tables away had paid her check and left her newspaper behind. I read it, and had another cup of coffee with it, and a shot of bourbon to sweeten the coffee.\\n\\n The afternoon crowd was starting to fill the room when I called the waitress over. I palmed her a buck and told her to put the check on my tab.\\n\\n \"No check,\" she said. \"The gentleman paid it.\"\\n\\n She was new, she didn\u0027t know Skip by name. \"He wasn\u0027t supposed to do that,\" I said. \"Anyway, I had a drink after he left. Put it on my tab, all right?\"\\n\\n \"Talk to Dennis,\" she said.\\n\\n She went to take somebody\u0027s order before I could reply. I went to the bar and crooked a finger for Dennis. \"She tells me there\u0027s no check for my table,\" I said.\\n\\n \"She speaks the truth.\" He smiled. He often smiled, as if much of what he saw amused him. \"Devoe paid the check.\"\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t supposed to do that. Anyway, I had a drink after he left and told her to put it on my tab, and she said to see you. Is this something new? Don\u0027t I have a tab?\"\\n\\n His smile broadened. \"Anytime you want one, but as a matter of fact you don\u0027t have one now. Mr. Devoe covered it. Wiped the slate clean.\"\\n\\n \"What did it come to?\"\\n\\n \"Eighty dollars and change. I could probably come up with the exact figure if it mattered. Does it?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"He gave me a hundred dollars to cover your tab, the check today, a tip for Lyddie and something to ease my own weariness of the soul. I suppose one could maintain that your most recent drink was not covered, but my inscrutable sense of the rightness of things is that it was.\" Another wide smile. \"So you owe us nothing,\" he said.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t argue. If there was one thing I learned in the NYPD, it was to take what people gave me.\\n\\n Chapter 5\\n\\n I went back to my hotel, checked for mail and messages. There were none of either. The desk clerk, a loose-limbed black man from Antigua, said that he didn\u0027t mind the heat but he missed the ocean breezes.\\n\\n I went upstairs and took a shower. My room was hot. There was an air-conditioner, but something was wrong with its cooling element. It moved the warm air around and gave it a chemical flavor but didn\u0027t do much about the heat or the humidity. I could shut it off and open the window from the top, but the air outside was no better. I stretched out and must have dozed off for an hour or so, and when I woke up I needed another shower.\\n\\n I took it and then called Fran. Her roommate answered. I gave my name and waited what seemed like a long time for Fran to come to the phone.\\n\\n I suggested dinner, and maybe a movie afterward if we felt up to it. \"Oh, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t tonight, Matt,\" she said. \"I have other plans. Maybe some other time?\"\\n\\n I hung up regretting that I\u0027d called. I checked the mirror, decided I didn\u0027t really need a shave after all, got dressed and got out of there.\\n\\n It was hot on the street, but it would cool down in a couple of hours. Meanwhile, there were bars all over the place, and their air-conditioners all worked better than mine.\\n\\n CURIOUSLY, I didn\u0027t hit it all that hard. I was in a surly mood, gruff and ill-tempered, and that usually led me to take my drinks fast. But I was restless, and as a result I moved around a lot. There were even a few bars that I walked into and out of without ordering anything.\\n\\n At one point I almost got into a fight. In a joint on Tenth Avenue a rawboned drunk with a couple of teeth missing bumped into me and spilled part of his drink on me, then took exception to the way I accepted his apology. It was all over nothing- he was looking for a fight and I was very nearly ready to oblige him. Then one of his friends grabbed his arms from behind and another stepped between us, and I came to my senses and got out of there.\\n\\n I walked east on Fifty-seventh. A couple of black hookers were working the pavement in front of the Holiday Inn. I noticed them more than I usually did. One, with a face like an ebony mask, challenged me with her eyes. I felt a rush of anger, and I didn\u0027t know who or what I was angry at.\\n\\n I walked over to Ninth, up half a block to Armstrong\u0027s. I wasn\u0027t surprised to see Fran there. It was almost as if I had expected her to be there, seated at a table along the north wall. She had her back to me and hadn\u0027t noticed me come in.\\n\\n Hers was a table for two, and her partner was no one I recognized. He had blond hair and eyebrows and an open young face, and he was wearing a slate-blue short-sleeved shirt with epaulets. I think they call it a safari shirt. He was smoking a pipe and drinking a beer. Her drink was something red in an oversize stemmed glass.\\n\\n Probably a tequila sunrise. That was a big year for tequila sunrises.\\n\\n I turned to the bar, and there was Carolyn. The tables were crowded but the bar was half empty, lightly attended for that hour on a Friday night. At her right, toward the door, a couple of beer drinkers stood talking baseball. To her left, there were three vacant stools in a row.\\n\\n I took the middle one and ordered bourbon, a double with water back. Billie served it, saying something about the weather. I took a sip of my drink and shot a quick glance at Carolyn.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t appear to be waiting for Tommy or for anyone else, nor did she look as though she\u0027d just breezed in a few minutes ago. She was wearing yellow pedal pushers and a sleeveless lime-green blouse. Her light brown hair was combed to frame her little fox face. She was drinking something dark from a lowball glass.\\n\\n At least it wasn\u0027t a tequila sunrise.\\n\\n I drank some bourbon, glanced in spite of myself at Fran and was irritated with my own irritation. I\u0027d had two dates with her, there was no great mutual attraction, no chemical magic, just two nights of leaving her at her door. And tonight I\u0027d called her, late, and she\u0027d said she had other plans, and here she was, drinking a tequila sunrise with her other plan.\\n\\n Where did I get off being mad about that?\\n\\n I thought, I\u0027ll bet she doesn\u0027t tell him she\u0027s got an early day tomorrow. I bet the White Hunter there doesn\u0027t have to say goodnight downstairs.\\n\\n To my right, a voice with a Piedmont softness to it said, \"I forget your name.\"\\n\\n I looked up.\\n\\n \"I believe we were introduced,\" she said, \"but I don\u0027t recall your name.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Matthew Scudder,\" I said, \"and you\u0027re right, Tommy introduced us. You\u0027re Carolyn.\"\\n\\n \"Carolyn Cheatham. Have you seen him?\"\\n\\n \"Tommy? Not since it happened.\"\\n\\n \"Neither have I. Were you-all at the funeral?\"\\n\\n \"No. I thought about going but I didn\u0027t get there.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you go? You never met her, did you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Neither did I.\" She laughed. There wasn\u0027t much mirth in it. \"Big surprise, I never met his wife. I would have gone this afternoon. But I didn\u0027t.\" She took her lower lip between her teeth. \"Matt. Whyn\u0027t you buy me a drink? Or I\u0027ll buy you one, but come sit next to me so\u0027s I don\u0027t have to shout. Please?\"\\n\\n She was drinking Amaretto, a sweet almond-flavored liqueur that she took on the rocks. It tastes like dessert but it\u0027s almost as strong as whiskey.\\n\\n \"He told me not to come,\" she said. \"To the funeral. It was someplace in Brooklyn, that\u0027s a whole foreign nation to me, Brooklyn, but a lot of people went from the office. I wouldn\u0027t have had to know how to get there, I could have had a ride, I could have been part of the office crowd, come to pay my respects along with everybody else. But he said not to, he said it wouldn\u0027t look right.\"\\n\\n Her bare arms were lightly dusted with golden hair. She was wearing perfume, a floral scent with an undertaste of musk.\\n\\n \"He said it wouldn\u0027t look right,\" she said. \"He said it was a matter of respect for the dead.\" She picked up her glass and stared into it.\\n\\n She said, \"Respect. What\u0027s the man care about respect? What\u0027s he so much as know about respect, for the dead or for the living? I would just have been part of the office crowd. We both work there at Tannahill, far as anyone knows we\u0027re just friends. Lord\u0027s sake, all we ever were is friends.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever you say.\"\\n\\n \"Well, shit,\" she said, drawling it, giving the word an extra syllable or two. \"Ah don\u0027t mean to say Ah wasn\u0027t fucking him. Ah surely don\u0027t mean that. But all it ever was was laughs and good times. He was married and went home to mama most every night\"- she drank some Amaretto- \"and that was jes fine, believe me, because who in her right mind\u0027d want Tommy Tillary around by the dawn\u0027s early light? Christ in the foothills, Matthew, did I spill this or drink it?\"\\n\\n We agreed that she was drinking them a little too fast. Sweet drinks, we assured each other, had a way of sneaking up on a person. It was this fancy New York Amaretto shit, she maintained. It wasn\u0027t like the bourbon she\u0027d grown up on. You knew where you stood with bourbon.\\n\\n I reminded her that I was a bourbon drinker myself, and it pleased her to learn this. Alliances have been forged on more tenuous bonds than that, and she sealed ours with a sip from my glass. I offered it to her, and she put her little hand on mine to steady the glass, sipping daintily at the liquor.\\n\\n \"BOURBON is low-down,\" she said. \"You know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Here I thought it was a gentleman\u0027s drink.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s for a gentleman likes to get down in the dirt. Scotch is vests and ties and prep school. Bourbon is an old boy ready to let the animal out, ready to let the nasty show. Bourbon is sitting up on a hot night and not minding if you sweat.\"\\n\\n Nobody was sweating. We were in her apartment, sitting on her couch in a sunken living room set about a foot below the level of the kitchen and foyer. Her building was an Art Deco apartment house on Fifty-seventh just a few doors west of Ninth. A bottle of Maker\u0027s Mark from the store around the corner stood on top of her glass-and-wrought-iron coffee table. Her air-conditioner was on, quieter than mine and more effective. We were drinking out of rocks glasses but we weren\u0027t bothering with ice. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-8.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
