I could have called her, but I sensed that it was perfectly appropriate not to. Friday night had been just what each of us had evidently wanted, and it looked as though it had been complete in itself for both of us, and I was glad of that. As a fringe benefit, I was over whatever had had me bugged about Fran, and it was beginning to look as though it had been nothing much more complicated than old-fashioned horniness. I suppose a half-hour with one of the streetwalkers would have served me as well, if less pleasurably.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t run into Tommy, either, and that, too, was a relief, and in no sense disappointing.\\n\\n Then Monday morning I picked up the News and read that they\u0027d pulled in a pair of young Hispanics from Sunset Park for the Tillary burglary and homicide. The paper ran the usual photo- two skinny youths, their hair unruly, one of them trying to hide his face from the camera, the other smirking defiantly, and each of them handcuffed to a broad-shouldered grimfaced Irishman in a suit. There was a caption to tell you which ones were the good guys, but you didn\u0027t really need it.\\n\\n I was in Armstrong\u0027s that afternoon when the phone rang. Dennis put down the glass he was wiping and answered it. \"He was here a minute ago,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll see if he stepped out.\" He covered the mouthpiece with his hand and looked quizzically at me. \"Are you still here?\" he asked. \"Or did you slip away while my attention was somehow diverted?\"\\n\\n \"Who wants to know?\"\\n\\n \"Tommy Tillary.\"\\n\\n You never know what a woman will decide to tell a man, or how a man will react to it. I didn\u0027t much want to find out, but I was better off learning over the phone than face-to-face. I nodded and Dennis passed the phone across the bar.\\n\\n I said, \"Matt Scudder, Tommy. I was sorry to hear about your wife.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Matt. Jesus, it feels like it happened a year ago. It was what, a little over a week?\"\\n\\n \"At least they got the bastards.\"\\n\\n There was a pause. Then he said, \"Jesus. You haven\u0027t seen a paper, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Sure I did. Two Spanish kids, had their pictures.\"\\n\\n \"I guess you read this morning\u0027s News.\"\\n\\n \"I generally do. Why?\"\\n\\n \"But not this afternoon\u0027s Post.\"\\n\\n \"No. Why, what happened? They turn out to be clean?\"\\n\\n \"Clean,\" he said, and snorted. Then he said, \"I figured you\u0027d know. The cops came by early this morning, before I saw the story in the News, so I didn\u0027t even know about the arrest. Shit. Be easier if you already knew this.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not following you, Tommy.\"\\n\\n \"The two Latin lovers. Clean? Shit, the men\u0027s room in the Times Square subway station, that\u0027s how clean they are. The cops hit their place and found stuff from my house everywhere they looked. Jewelry they had descriptions of, a stereo that I gave them the serial number, everything. Monogrammed shit. I mean that\u0027s how clean they were, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So they admitted the burglary but not the murder.\"\\n\\n \"Crooks do that all the time, Tommy.\"\\n\\n \"Lemme finish, huh? They admitted the burglary, but according to them it wasn\u0027t really a burglary. I was giving them all that stuff.\"\\n\\n \"And they just came to pick it up in the middle of the night.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right. No, their story was they were supposed to make it look like a burglary so I could collect from my insurance. I could claim a loss on top of what they were actually taking, and that way everybody\u0027s to the good.\"\\n\\n \"What did the actual loss amount to?\"\\n\\n \"Shit, I don\u0027t know. There were twice as many things turned up at their place as I ever listed when I made out a report. There\u0027s things I missed a few days after I filled out the report and other stuff I didn\u0027t know was gone until the cops found them. And they took things weren\u0027t covered. There was a fur of Peg\u0027s, we were gonna get a floater on it and we never did. And some of her jewelry, same story. I got a standard homeowner\u0027s policy, it didn\u0027t cover anywheres near everything they took. They got a set of sterling, it came down to us from her aunt, I swear I forgot we owned the stuff. And it wasn\u0027t covered, either.\"\\n\\n \"It hardly sounds like an insurance setup.\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not. How the hell could it be? Anyway, the important thing is according to them the house was empty when they hit it. Peg wasn\u0027t home.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And I set them up is their story. They hit the place, they carted everything away, and then I came home with Peg and stabbed her six, eight times, whatever it was, and left her there so it looked like it happened during a burglary.\"\\n\\n \"How could the burglars testify that you stabbed your wife?\"\\n\\n \"They couldn\u0027t. All they said was they didn\u0027t and she wasn\u0027t home when they were there and I had it arranged with them to do the burglary. The cops pieced the rest of it together.\"\\n\\n \"What did they do, arrest you?\"\\n\\n \"No. They came over to the hotel where I\u0027m staying, it was early, I was just out of the shower. Now this was the first I knew that the spics were arrested, let alone that they were trying to do a job on me. They just wanted to talk, the cops, and at first I talked to them, and then I started to get the drift of what they were trying to put on me. So I said I wasn\u0027t saying anything more without my lawyer present, and I called him, and he left half his breakfast on the table and came over in a hurry, and he wouldn\u0027t let me say a word.\"\\n\\n \"And they didn\u0027t take you in or book you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"But they didn\u0027t entirely buy your story either?\"\\n\\n \"No way. I didn\u0027t really tell \u0027em a story because Kaplan wouldn\u0027t let me say anything. They didn\u0027t drag me in because they don\u0027t have a case yet, but according to Kaplan they\u0027re going to be building one if they can. They told me not to leave town. You believe it? My wife\u0027s dead, the Post headline says \u0027Quiz Husband in Burglary Murder,\u0027 and what the hell do they think I\u0027m gonna do? Am I going fishing for fucking trout in Montana? \u0027Don\u0027t leave town.\u0027 You see this shit on television, you think nobody in real life talks like that. Maybe television\u0027s where they get it from.\"\\n\\n I waited for him to tell me what he wanted from me. I didn\u0027t have long to wait.\\n\\n \"Why I called,\" he said, \"is Kaplan thinks we ought to hire a detective. He figures maybe these guys talked around the neighborhood, maybe they bragged to their friends, maybe there\u0027s a way to prove they did the killing. He says the cops won\u0027t concentrate on that end if they\u0027re too busy trying to nail the lid shut on me.\"\\n\\n I explained that I didn\u0027t have any official standing, that I had no license and filed no reports.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s okay,\" he insisted. \"I told Kaplan what I want is somebody I can trust, somebody\u0027ll do a job for me. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re gonna have any kind of a case at all, Matt, because I can account for my time and I couldn\u0027ta been where I woulda hadda be to do what they said I did. But the longer this shit drags on the worse it is for me. I want it cleared up, I want it in the papers that these Spanish assholes did it all and I had nothing to do with anything. I want that for me and for the people I do business with and for my relatives and Peg\u0027s relatives and all the wonderful people who voted for me. You remember the old \u0027Amateur Hour\u0027? \u0027I want to thank mom and dad and Aunt Edith and my piano teacher Mrs. Pelton and all the wonderful people who voted for me.\u0027 Listen, you\u0027ll meet me and Kaplan in his office, hear what the man has to say, do me a hell of a big favor, and pick up a couple of bucks for yourself. What do you say, Matt?\"\\n\\n He wanted somebody he could trust. Had Carolyn from the Caroline told him how trustworthy I was?\\n\\n What did I say? I said yes.\\n\\n Chapter 7\\n\\n I took a train one stop into Brooklyn and met Tommy Tillary in Drew Kaplan\u0027s office on Court Street a few blocks from Brooklyn \u0027s Borough Hall. There was a Lebanese restaurant next door. At the corner a grocery store specializing in Middle Eastern imports stood next to an antique shop overflowing with stripped oak furniture and brass lamps and bedsteads. In front of Kaplan\u0027s building, a legless black man reposed on a platform with wheels. An open cigar box on one side of him held a couple of singles and a lot of coins. He was wearing horn-rimmed sunglasses, and a hand-lettered sign on the pavement in front of him said, \"Don\u0027t Be Fooled by the Sunglasses. Not Blind Just No Legs.\"\\n\\n Kaplan\u0027s office ran to wood paneling and leather chairs and oak file cabinets that might have come from the place on the corner. His name and the names of two partners were painted on the frosted glass of the hall door in old-fashioned gold and black lettering. Framed diplomas on the wall of his personal office showed he\u0027d earned his B.A. at Adelphi, his LL.B. at Brooklyn Law. A lucite cube on top of a Victorian oak desk held photographs of his wife and young children. A bronzed railway spike served as a desktop paperweight. On the wall alongside the desk, a pendulum clock ticked away the afternoon.\\n\\n Kaplan himself looked conservatively up-to-date in a tropical-weight gray pinstripe suit and a yellow pin-dot tie. He looked to be in his early thirties, which would fit the dates on the diplomas. He was shorter than I and of course much shorter than Tommy, trimly built, clean-shaven, with dark hair and eyes and a slightly lopsided smile. His handshake was medium-firm, his gaze direct but measuring, calculating.\\n\\n Tommy wore his burgundy blazer over gray flannel trousers and white loafers. Strain showed at the corners of his blue eyes and around his mouth. His complexion was off, too, as if anxiety had caused the blood to draw inward, leaving the skin sallow.\\n\\n \"All we want you to do,\" Drew Kaplan said, \"is find a key in one of their pants pockets, Herrera\u0027s or Cruz\u0027s, and trace it to a locker in Penn Station, and in the locker there\u0027s a foot-long knife with both their prints and her blood on it.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what it\u0027s going to take?\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Let\u0027s just say it wouldn\u0027t hurt. No, actually we\u0027re not in such bad shape. What they\u0027ve got is some shaky testimony from a pair of Latins who\u0027ve been in and out of trouble since they got weaned onto Tropicana. And they\u0027ve got what looks to them like a good motive on Tommy\u0027s part.\"\\n\\n \"Which is?\"\\n\\n I was looking at Tommy when I asked. His eyes slipped away from mine. Kaplan said, \"A marital triangle, a case of the shorts, and a strong money motive. Margaret Tillary came into some money this past spring upon the death of an aunt. The estate\u0027s not through probate yet but the value\u0027s somewhere in excess of half a million dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Be less than that when they get done hackin\u0027 away at it,\" Tommy said. \"A whole lot less.\"\\n\\n \"Plus there\u0027s insurance. Tommy and his wife had a pair of straight-life policies, each naming the other as beneficiary, both with double-indemnity clauses and a face amount of\"- he consulted a slip on his desk- \"a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which doubled for accidental death is three hundred thousand. At this point we\u0027ve got what begins to look like seven, eight hundred thousand motives for murder.\"\\n\\n \"My lawyer talkin\u0027,\" Tommy said.\\n\\n \"Same time, Tommy here\u0027s hurting a little for cash. He\u0027s having a bad year gambling, he\u0027s into the bookies and maybe they\u0027re starting to press him a little.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-10.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
