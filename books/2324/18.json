I tried to think, and I guess I must have dozed off myself. I don\u0027t suppose I was out for more than a few minutes, just time enough to lose myself in a dream that fled from me the minute I opened my eyes and blinked it away.\\n\\n I let myself out. Her door had a spring lock. There was a dead bolt you could engage with the key for extra security, but all I had to do was draw the door shut and it was locked, and reasonably secure. I took the elevator down and went outside.\\n\\n The rain was holding off. At the corner of Ninth Avenue a jogger passed, running doggedly uptown against what little traffic there was. His T-shirt was gray with sweat and he look ready to drop. I thought of O\u0027Bannon, Jack Diebold\u0027s old partner, getting physically fit before blowing his brains out.\\n\\n And then I remembered what I\u0027d wanted to do at Carolyn\u0027s apartment. I\u0027d been planning on taking away the little gun Tommy had given her. If she was going to drink like that and get depressed like that, she didn\u0027t need to have a weapon in the bedside table.\\n\\n But the door was locked. And she was out cold, she wasn\u0027t going to wake up and kill herself.\\n\\n I crossed the street. The steel gate was drawn most of the way across the front of Armstrong\u0027s, and the white globe lights over the front were out, but light showed from within. I walked over to the door, saw that the chairs were on top of the tables, ready for the Dominican kid who came in first thing in the morning to sweep the place out. I didn\u0027t see Billie at first, and then I saw him at a stool at the far end of the bar. The door was locked, but he spotted me and came over and let me in.\\n\\n He locked the door again after I was through it, walked me over to the bar and slipped behind it. Without my saying anything he poured me a glass of bourbon. I curled my hand around it but didn\u0027t pick it up from the top of the bar.\\n\\n \"The coffee\u0027s all gone,\" he said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right. I didn\u0027t want any more.\"\\n\\n \"She all right? Carolyn?\"\\n\\n \"Well, she might have a hangover tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Just about everybody I know might have a hangover tomorrow,\" he said. \"I might have a hangover tomorrow. It\u0027s gonna pour, I might as well sit in the house and eat aspirin all day.\"\\n\\n Someone banged on the door. Billie shook his head at him, waved him away. The man knocked again. Billie ignored him.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t they see the place is closed?\" he complained. \"Put your money away, Matt. We\u0027re closed, the register\u0027s locked up, it\u0027s private-party time.\" He held his glass to the light and looked at it. \"Beautiful color,\" he said. \"She\u0027s a pisser, old Carolyn. A bourbon drinker\u0027s a gentleman and a scotch drinker\u0027s- what did she say a scotch drinker was?\"\\n\\n \"I think a hypocrite.\"\\n\\n \"So I gave her the straight line, didn\u0027t I? What\u0027s it make a man if he drinks Irish whiskey? An Irishman.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you asked.\"\\n\\n \"What else it makes him is drunk, but in a nice way. I only get drunk in the nicest possible way. Ah, Jesus, Matt, these are the best hours of the day. You can keep your Morrissey\u0027s. This is like having your own private after-hours, you know? The joint empty and dark, the music off, the chairs up, one or two people around for company, the rest of the world locked the hell out. Great, huh?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not bad.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not.\"\\n\\n He was freshening my drink. I didn\u0027t remember drinking it. I said, \"You know, my trouble is I can\u0027t go home.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what Thomas Wolfe said, \u0027You Can\u0027t Go Home Again.\u0027 That\u0027s everybody\u0027s trouble.\"\\n\\n \"No, I mean it. My feet keep taking me to a bar instead. I was out in Brooklyn, I got home late, I was tired, I was already half in the bag, I started to walk to my hotel and I turned around and came here instead. And just now I put her to sleep, Carolyn, and I had to drag myself out of there before I fell asleep in her chair, and instead of going home like a sane human being I came back here again like some dim homing pigeon.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a swallow and this is Capistrano.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what I am? I don\u0027t know what the hell I am anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, bullshit. You\u0027re a guy, a human being. Just another poor son of a bitch who doesn\u0027t want to be alone when the sacred ginmill closes.\"\\n\\n \"The what?\" I started to laugh. \"Is that what this place is? The sacred ginmill?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you know the song?\"\\n\\n \"What song?\"\\n\\n \"The Van Ronk song. \u0027And so we\u0027ve had another night- \u0027 \" He broke off. \"Hell, I can\u0027t sing, I can\u0027t even get the tune right. \u0027Last Call,\u0027 Dave Van Ronk. You don\u0027t know it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Christ,\" he said. \"You have got to hear it. You have by Christ got to hear this song. It\u0027s what we\u0027ve been talking about, and on top of that it\u0027s the fucking national anthem. Come on.\"\\n\\n \"Come on and what?\"\\n\\n \"Just come on,\" he said. He put a Piedmont Airlines flight bag on top of the bar, rooted around under the back bar and came up with two unopened bottles, one of the twelve-year-old Jameson Irish he favored and one of Jack Daniel\u0027s. \"This okay?\" he asked me.\\n\\n \"Okay for what?\"\\n\\n \"For pouring over your head to kill the cooties. Is it okay to drink is my question. You\u0027ve been drinking Forester, but I can\u0027t find an unopened bottle, and there\u0027s a law against carrying an opened bottle on the street.\"\\n\\n \"There is?\"\\n\\n \"There ought to be. I never steal opened bottles. Will you please answer a simple question? Is Jack Black all right?\"\\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s all right, but where the hell are we going?\"\\n\\n \"My place,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve got to hear this record.\"\\n\\n \"BARTENDERS drink free,\" he said. \"Even at home. It\u0027s a fringe benefit. Other people get pension plans and dental care. We get all the booze we can steal. You\u0027re gonna love this song, Matt.\"\\n\\n We were in his apartment, an L-shaped studio with a parquet floor and a fireplace. He was on the twenty-second floor and his window looked south. He had a good view of the Empire State Building and, farther down on the right, the World Trade Center.\\n\\n The place was sparsely furnished. There was a white mica platform bed and dresser in the sleeping alcove, a couch and a sling chair in the middle of the room. Books and records overflowed a bookcase and stood around in stacks on the floor. Stereo components were placed here and there- a turntable on an upended milk crate, speakers resting on the floor.\\n\\n \"Where did I put the thing?\" Billie wondered.\\n\\n I walked over to the window, looked out at the city. I was wearing a watch but I purposely didn\u0027t look at it because I didn\u0027t want to know what time it was. I suppose it must have been somewhere around four o\u0027clock. It still wasn\u0027t raining.\\n\\n \"Here,\" he said, holding up an album. \"Dave Van Ronk. You know him?\"\\n\\n \"Never heard of him.\"\\n\\n \"Got a Dutch name, looks like a mick and I swear on the blues numbers he sounds just like a nigger. He\u0027s also one bitchin\u0027 guitar player but he doesn\u0027t play anything on this cut. \u0027Last Call.\u0027 He sings it al fresco.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Not al fresco. I forget the expression. How do you say it when you sing without accompaniment?\"\\n\\n \"What difference does it make?\"\\n\\n \"How can I forget something like that? I got a mind like a fucking sieve. You\u0027re gonna love this song.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s if I ever get to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"A cappella. That\u0027s what it is, a cappella. As soon as I stopped actively trying to think of it, it popped right into my head. The Zen of Remembering. Where did I put the Irish?\"\\n\\n \"Right behind you.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. You all right with the Daniel\u0027s? Oh, you got the bottle right there. Okay, listen to this. Ooops, wrong groove. It\u0027s the last one on the album. Naturally, you couldn\u0027t have anything come after this one. Listen.\"\\n\\n And so we\u0027ve had another night\\n\\n Of poetry and poses\\n\\n And each man knows he\u0027ll be alone\\n\\n When the sacred ginmill closes.\\n\\n The melody sounded like an Irish folk air. The singer did indeed sing without accompaniment, his voice rough but curiously gentle.\\n\\n \"Now listen to this,\" Billie said.\\n\\n And so we\u0027ll drink the final glass\\n\\n Each to his joy and sorrow\\n\\n And hope the numbing drunk will last\\n\\n Till opening tomorrow\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" Billie said.\\n\\n And when we stumble back again\\n\\n Like paralytic dancers\\n\\n Each knows the question he must ask\\n\\n And each man knows the answer\\n\\n I had a bottle in one hand, a glass in the other. I poured from the bottle into the glass. \"Catch this next part,\" Billie was saying.\\n\\n And so we\u0027ll drink the final drink\\n\\n That cuts the brain in sections\\n\\n Where answers do not signify\\n\\n And there aren\u0027t any questions\\n\\n Billie was saying something but the words weren\u0027t registering. There was only the song.\\n\\n I broke my heart the other day.\\n\\n It will mend again tomorrow.\\n\\n If I\u0027d been drunk when I was born\\n\\n I\u0027d be ignorant of sorrow\\n\\n \"Play that again,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Wait. There\u0027s more.\"\\n\\n And so we\u0027ll drink the final toast\\n\\n That never can be spoken:\\n\\n Here\u0027s to the heart that is wise enough\\n\\n To know when it\u0027s better off broken\\n\\n He said, \"Well?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to hear it again.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Play it again, Sam. You played it for her, you can play it for me. I can take it if she can.\u0027 Isn\u0027t it great?\"\\n\\n \"Play it again, will you?\"\\n\\n We listened to it a couple of times through. Finally he took it off and returned it to its jacket and asked me if I understood why he had to drag me up there and play it for me. I just nodded.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" he said, \"you\u0027re welcome to crash here if you want. That couch is more comfortable than it looks.\"\\n\\n \"I can make it home.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Is it raining yet?\" He looked out the window. \"No, but it could start any minute.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll chance it. I want to be at my place when I wake up.\"\\n\\n \"I got to respect a man who can plan that far in the future. You okay to go out on the street? Sure, you\u0027re okay. Here, I\u0027ll get you a paper bag, you can take the JD home with you. Or here, take the flight bag, they\u0027ll think you\u0027re a pilot.\"\\n\\n \"No, keep it, Billie.\"\\n\\n \"What do I want with it? I don\u0027t drink bourbon.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve had enough.\"\\n\\n \"You might want a nightcap. You might want something in the morning. It\u0027s a doggie bag, for Christ\u0027s sake. When\u0027d you get so fancy you can\u0027t take a doggie bag home with you?\"\\n\\n \"Somebody told me it\u0027s illegal to carry an opened bottle on the street.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s a first offense, you\u0027re odds-on to get probation. Hey, Matt? Thanks for coming by.\"\\n\\n I walked home with the song\u0027s phrases echoing in my mind, coming back at me in fragments. \"If I\u0027d been drunk when I was born I\u0027d be ignorant of sorrow.\" Jesus.\\n\\n I got back to my hotel, went straight upstairs without checking the desk for messages. I got out of my clothes, threw them on the chair, took one short pull straight from the bottle and got into bed.\\n\\n Just as I was drifting off the rain started.\\n\\n Chapter 13\\n\\n The rain kept up all weekend. It was lashing my window when I opened my eyes around noon Friday, but it must have been the phone that woke me. I sat on the edge of the bed and decided not to answer it, and after a few more rings it quit. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-18.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
