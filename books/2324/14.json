{"id":63072,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"I had a lunch of beans and rice and hot sausage. I got to Saint Michael\u0027s by midafternoon. It was open this time, and I sat for a while in a pew off to the side, then lit a couple of candles. My $150 finally made it to the poor box. I did what you do. Mostly, I walked around and knocked on doors and asked questions. I went back to both their residences, Herrera\u0027s and Cruz\u0027s. I talked to neighbors of Cruz\u0027s who hadn\u0027t been around the previous day, and I talked to some of the other tenants in Herrera\u0027s rooming house. I walked over to the Six-eight looking for Cal Neumann. He wasn\u0027t there, but I talked to a couple of cops in the station house and went out for coffee with one of them. I made a couple of phone calls, but most of my activity was walking around and talking to people face-to-face, writing down bits and pieces in my notebook, going through the motions and trying not to question the point of my actions. I was amassing a certain amount of data but I had no idea whether or not it added up to anything. I didn\u0027t know what exactly I was looking for, or if there was anything there to look for. I suppose I was trying to perform enough action and produce enough information to justify, to myself and to Tommy and his lawyer, the fee I had already collected and largely dispersed. By early evening I\u0027d had enough. I took the train home. There was a message at the desk for me from Tommy Tillary, with his office number. I put it in my pocket and walked around the corner, and Billie Keegan told me Skip was looking for me. \"Everybody\u0027s looking for me,\" I said. \"It\u0027s nice to be wanted,\" Billie said. \"I had an uncle was wanted in four states. You had a phone message, too. Where\u0027d I put it?\" He handed me a slip. Tommy Tillary again, but a different phone number this time. \"Something to drink, Matt? Or did you just drop by to check your mail and messages?\" I\u0027d been taking it easy in Brooklyn, mostly sticking with cups of coffee in bakeries and bodegas, drinking a little beer in the bars. I let Billie pour me a double bourbon and it went down easy. \"Looked for you today,\" Billie said. \"Couple of us went out to the track. Thought you might want to come along.\" \"I had work to do,\" I said. \"Anyway, I\u0027m not much for horses.\" \"It\u0027s fun,\" he said, \"if you don\u0027t take it serious.\" THE number Tommy Tillary left turned out to be a hotel switchboard in Murray Hill. He came on the line and asked if I could drop by the hotel. \"You know where it is? Thirty-seventh and Lex?\" \"I ought to be able to find it.\" \"They got a bar downstairs, nice quiet little place. It\u0027s full of these Jap businessmen in Brooks Brothers suits. Every once in a while they put down their scotches long enough to take snapshots of each other. Then they smile and order more drinks. You\u0027ll love it.\" I caught a cab and went over there, and he hadn\u0027t been exaggerating much. The cocktail lounge, plush and dimly lit, had a largely Japanese clientele that evening. Tommy was by himself at the bar, and when I walked in he pumped my hand and introduced me to the bartender. We took our drinks to a table. \"Crazy place,\" he said. \"Look at that, will you? You thought I was kidding about the cameras, didn\u0027t you? I wonder what they do with all the pictures. You\u0027d need a whole room in your house just to keep them, the way they click \u0027em off.\" \"There\u0027s no film in the cameras.\" \"Be a kick, wouldn\u0027t it?\" He laughed. \"No film in the cameras. Shit, they\u0027re probably not real Japs, either. Where I mostly been going, there\u0027s the Blueprint a block away on Park, and there\u0027s another place, a pub-type place, Dirty Dick\u0027s or something like that. But I\u0027m staying here and I wanted you to be able to reach me. Is this okay for now or should we go somewhere else?\" \"This is fine.\" \"You sure? I never had a detective work for me before, I want to make sure I keep him happy.\" He grinned, then let his face turn serious. \"I was just wondering,\" he said, \"if you were, you know, making any progress. Getting anyplace.\" I told him some of what I\u0027d run into. He got very excited when he heard about the barroom stabbing. \"That\u0027s great,\" he said. \"That ought to wrap it up for our little brown brothers, shouldn\u0027t it?\" \"How do you figure that?\" \"He\u0027s a knife artist,\" he said, \"and he already killed somebody once and got away with it. Jesus, this is great stuff, Matt. I knew it was the right move to get you in on this. Have you talked to Kaplan yet?\" \"No.\" \"That\u0027s what you want to do. This is the kind of stuff he can use.\" I wondered at that. For openers, it struck me that Drew Kaplan should have been able to inform himself of Miguelito Cruz\u0027s no-bill for homicide without hiring a detective. Nor did it seem to me that the information would weigh heavily in a courtroom, or that you could even introduce it in court, for that matter. Anyway, Kaplan had said he was looking for something that would keep him and his client out of court in the first place, and I couldn\u0027t see how I\u0027d uncovered anything that qualified. \"You want to fill Drew in on everything you come up with,\" Tommy assured me. \"Some little bit you hand him, might not look like anything to you, and it might fit with something he already has and it\u0027s just what he needs, you know what I mean? Even if it looks like nothing all by itself.\" \"I can see how that would work.\" \"Sure. Call him once a day, give him whatever you got. I know you don\u0027t file reports, but you don\u0027t mind checking in regular by phone, do you?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"Great,\" he said. \"That\u0027s great, Matt. Let me get us a couple more of these.\" He went to the bar, came back with fresh drinks. \"So you been out in my part of the world, huh? Like it out there?\" \"I like your neighborhood better than Cruz and Herrera\u0027s.\" \"Shit, I hope so. What, were you out by the house? My house?\" I nodded. \"To get a sense of it. You have a key, Tommy?\" \"A key? You mean a house key? Sure, I\u0027d have to have a key to my own house, wouldn\u0027t I? Why? You want a key to the place, Matt?\" \"If you don\u0027t mind.\" \"Jesus, everybody\u0027s been through there, cops, insurance, not to mention the spics.\" He took a ring of keys from his pocket, removed one and held it out to me. \"This is for the front door,\" he said. \"You want the side door key too? That\u0027s how they went in, there\u0027s cardboard taped up where they broke a pane to let themselves in.\" \"I noticed it this afternoon.\" \"So what do you need with the key? Just pull off the cardboard and let yourself in. While you\u0027re at it, see if there\u0027s anything left worth stealing and carry it outta there in a pillowcase.\" \"Is that how they did it?\" \"Who knows how they did it? That\u0027s how they do it on television, isn\u0027t it? Jesus, look at that, will ya? They take each other\u0027s pictures, they trade cameras and take \u0027em all over again. There\u0027s a lot of \u0027em stay at this hotel, that\u0027s why they come in here.\" He looked down at his hands, clasped loosely on the table in front of him. His pinkie ring had turned to one side and he reached to straighten it. \"The hotel\u0027s not bad,\" he said, \"but I can\u0027t stay here forever. You pay day rates, it adds up.\" \"Will you be moving back to Bay Ridge?\" He shook his head. \"What do I need with a place like that? It was too big for the two of us and I\u0027d rattle around there by myself. Forgetting about the feelings connected with it.\" \"How did you come to have such a large house for two people, Tommy?\" \"Well, it wasn\u0027t for two.\" He looked off, remembering. \"It was Peg\u0027s aunt\u0027s house. What happened, she put up the money to buy the place. She had some insurance money left after she buried her husband some years ago, and we needed a place to live because we had the baby coming. You knew we had a kid that died?\" \"I think there was something in the paper.\" \"In the death notice, yeah, I put it in. We had a boy, Jimmy. He wasn\u0027t right, he had congenital heart damage and some mental retardation. He died, it was just before his sixth birthday.\" \"That\u0027s hard, Tommy.\" \"It was harder for her. I think it woulda been worse than it was except he didn\u0027t live at home after the first few months. The medical problems, you couldn\u0027t really cope in a private home, you know what I mean? Plus the doctor took me aside and said, look, Mr. Tillary, the more your wife gets attached to the kid, the rougher it\u0027s gonna be on her when the inevitable happens. Because they knew he wasn\u0027t gonna live more than a couple of years.\" Without saying anything he got up and brought back fresh drinks. \"So it was the three of us,\" he went on, \"me and Peg and the aunt, and she had her room and her own bath an\u0027 all on the third floor, an\u0027 it was still a big house for three people, but the two women, you know, they kept each other company. And then when the old woman died, well, we talked about moving, but Peg was used to the house and used to the neighborhood.\" He took a breath and let his shoulders drop. \"What do I need, big house, drive back and forth or fight the subway, whole thing\u0027s a pain in the ass. Soon as all this clears up I\u0027ll sell the place, find myself a little apartment in the city.\" \"What part of town?\" \"You know, I don\u0027t even know. Around Gramercy Park is kind of nice. Or maybe the Upper East Side. Maybe buy a co-op in a decent building. I don\u0027t need a whole lot of space.\" He snorted. \"I could move in with whatsername. You know. Carolyn.\" \"Oh?\" \"You know we work at the same place. I see her there every day. \u0027I gave at the office.\u0027 \" He sighed. \"I been sort of stayin\u0027 away from the neighborhood until all of this is cleared up.\" \"Sure.\" And then we got on the subject of churches, and I don\u0027t remember how. Something to the effect that bars kept better hours than churches, that churches closed early. \"Well, they got to,\" he said, \"on account of the crime problem. Matt, when we were kids, who ever heard of somebody stealing from a church?\" \"I suppose it happened.\" \"I suppose it did but when did you ever hear of it? Nowadays you got a different class of people, they don\u0027t respect anything. Of course there\u0027s that church in Bensonhurst, I guess they keep whatever hours they want to.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I think it\u0027s Bensonhurst. Big church, I forget the name of it. Saint Something or other.\" \"That narrows it down.\" \"Don\u0027t you remember? Couple of years ago two black kids stole something off the altar. Gold candlesticks, whatever the hell it was. And it turns out Dominic Tutto\u0027s mother goes to mass there every morning. The capo, runs half of Brooklyn?\" \"Oh, right.\" \"And the word went out, and a week later the candlesticks are back on the altar. Or whatever the hell they were. I think it was candlesticks.\" \"Whatever.\" \"And the punks who took \u0027em,\" he said, \"disappeared. And the story I heard, well, you don\u0027t know if it was anything more than a story. I wasn\u0027t there, and I forget who I heard it from, but he wasn\u0027t there either, you know?\" \"What did you hear?\" \"I heard they hauled the two niggers to Tutto\u0027s basement,\" he said, \"and hung \u0027em on meat hooks.\" A flashbulb winked two tables away from us. \"And skinned \u0027em alive,\" he said. \"But who knows? You hear all these stories, you don\u0027t know what to believe.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-14.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
