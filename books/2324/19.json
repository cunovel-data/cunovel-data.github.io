{"id":63077,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"My head ached fiercely and my gut felt like it had taken somebody\u0027s best shot. I lay down again, got up quickly when the room started to spin. In the bathroom I washed down a couple of aspirin with a half-glass of water, but they came right back up again. I remembered the bottle Billie had pressed on me. I looked around for it and finally found it in the flight bag. I couldn\u0027t remember putting it back after the last drink of the night, but then there were other things I couldn\u0027t recall either, like most of the walk home from his apartment. That sort of miniblackout didn\u0027t bother me much. When you drove cross-country you didn\u0027t remember every billboard, every mile of highway. Why bother recalling every minute of your life? The bottle was a third gone, and that surprised me. I could recall having had one drink with Billie while we listened to the record, then a short one before I turned the lights out. I didn\u0027t want one now, but there are the ones you want and the ones you need, and this came under the latter heading. I poured a short shot into the water glass and shuddered when I swallowed it. It didn\u0027t stay down either, but it fixed things so the next one did. And then I could swallow another couple of aspirins with another half-glass of water, and this time they stayed swallowed. If I\u0027d been drunk when I was born… I stayed right there in my room. The weather gave me every reason to remain where I was, but I didn\u0027t really need an excuse. I had the sort of hangover I knew enough to treat with respect. If I\u0027d ever felt that bad without having drunk the night before, I\u0027d have gone straight to a hospital. As it was, I stayed put and treated myself like a man with an illness, which in retrospect would seem to have been more than metaphor. The phone rang again later in the afternoon. I could have had the desk stop my calls, but I didn\u0027t feel equal to the conversation that would have required. It seemed easier to let it ring itself out. It rang a third time in the early evening, and this time I picked it up. It was Skip Devoe. \"I was looking for you,\" he said. \"You going to bounce around later?\" \"I don\u0027t want to go out in this.\" \"Yeah, it\u0027s coming down again. It was slacking off for a while there and now it\u0027s teeming. The weather guy says we\u0027re gonna get a lot of it. We saw those guys yesterday.\" \"Already?\" \"Not the guys in the black hats, not the bad guys. The lawyers and the accountants. Our accountant\u0027s armed with what he calls a Jewish revolver. You know what that is?\" \"A fountain pen.\" \"You heard it, huh? Anyway, they all told us what we already knew, which is terrific, considering they\u0027ll bill us for the advice. We got to pay.\" \"Well, that\u0027s what you figured.\" \"Yeah, but it doesn\u0027t mean I like it. I spoke to the guy again, Mr. Voice on the Phone. I told old Telephone Tommy we needed the weekend to find the money.\" \"You told Tillary?\" \"Tillary? What are you talking about?\" \"You said-\" \"Oh, right, I didn\u0027t even make the connection. No, not Tillary, I just said Telephone Tommy, I could have said Teddy or any name with a T. Which suddenly I can\u0027t think of. Name me some names start with T.\" \"Do I have to?\" There was a pause. \"You don\u0027t feel so hot,\" he said. \"Keegan had me up till dawn listening to records,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not a hundred percent yet.\" \"Fucking Keegan,\" he said. \"We all hit it pretty good, but he\u0027s gonna kill himself with it.\" \"He does keep at it.\" \"Yeah. Listen, I won\u0027t keep you. What I want to know, can you keep Monday open? The day and the night. Because I think that\u0027s when we\u0027re gonna move on this, and if we have to do it I\u0027d just as soon get it over with.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"We\u0027ll talk about that, iron it out. Okay?\" What did I have to do on Monday? I was still working for Tommy Tillary, but I didn\u0027t much care what hours I put in. My conversation with Jack Diebold had confirmed my own opinion that I was wasting my time and Tillary\u0027s money, that they didn\u0027t have a case against him and weren\u0027t likely to make one. Carolyn Cheatham\u0027s diatribe had left me not greatly inclined to do much for Tommy anyway, or to feel all that guilty about taking his money and giving him small value for it. I had a couple of things to tell Drew Kaplan next time I talked to him. And I\u0027d dig up a few more along the way. But I might not have to put in too many long hours in Sunset Park \u0027s bars and bodegas. I told Skip Monday was wide open. LATER that evening I called the liquor store across the street, I ordered up two quarts of Early Times and asked them to have the kid stop at the deli and pick up a six-pack of ale and a couple of sandwiches. They knew me and knew I\u0027d make it worth the delivery boy\u0027s while to give me special service, and I did. It was worth it to me. I took it easy with the hard booze, drank a can of ale, and made myself eat half a sandwich. I took a hot shower, and that helped, and then I ate another half-sandwich and drank another can of ale. I went to sleep, and when I woke up I put the TV on and watched Bogart and Ida Lupino, I guess it was, in High Sierra. I didn\u0027t pay a whole lot of attention to the movie but it was company. I went over to the window now and then and watched the rain. I ate part of the remaining sandwich, drank some more ale, and nipped a little from the bourbon bottle. When the movie ended I turned the set off and had a couple of aspirins and went back to bed. SATURDAY I was a little more mobile. I needed a drink again on awakening but I made it a short one, and the first one stayed down this time. I had a shower, drank the last can of ale, and went downstairs and had breakfast at the Red Flame. I left half of the eggs but ate the potatoes and a double order of rye toast and drank a lot of coffee. I read the paper, or tried to. I couldn\u0027t make much sense out of what I read. After breakfast I stopped in McGovern\u0027s for a quick one. Then I went around the corner to St. Paul \u0027s and sat there in the soft stillness for a half-hour or so. Then back to the hotel. I watched a baseball game in my room, and a fight on \"Wide World of Sports,\" along with the arm-wrestling championship of the world and some women doing some kind of aquatic mono-ski exhibition. What they were doing was evidently very difficult, but not terribly interesting to look at. I turned them off and left. I dropped in at Armstrong\u0027s and talked to a couple of people, then went over to Joey Farrell\u0027s for a bowl of three-alarm chili and a couple of Carta Blancas. I had a brandy with my coffee before returning to the hotel for the night. I had enough bourbon in the room to get me through Sunday but I stopped and picked up some beer because I was almost out and the stores can\u0027t sell it before noon on Sunday. Nobody knows why. Maybe the churches are behind it, maybe they want the faithful showing up with their hangovers sharp at the edges, maybe repentance is easier to sell to the severely afflicted. I sipped and watched TV movies. I slept in front of the set, woke up in the middle of a war movie, had a shower and shaved and sat around in my underwear watching the end of that movie and the start of another, sipping bourbon and beer until I could go back to sleep again. When I woke up again, it was Sunday afternoon and it was still raining. AROUND three-thirty the phone rang. I picked it up on the third ring and said hello. \"Matthew?\" It was a woman, and for an instant I thought it was Anita. Then she said, \"I tried you day before yesterday, but there was no answer,\" and I heard the Tarheel in her voice. \"I want to thank you,\" she said. \"Nothing to thank me for, Carolyn.\" \"I want to thank you for being a gentleman,\" she said, and her laughter came gently. \"A bourbon-drinking gentleman. I seem to remember having a lot to say on that subject.\" \"As I recall, you were reasonably eloquent.\" \"And on other subjects as well. I apologized to Billie for being less than a lady and he assured me I was fine, but bartenders always tell you that, don\u0027t they? I want to thank you-all for seeing me home.\" A pause. \"Uh, did we-\" \"No.\" A sigh. \"Well, I\u0027m glad of that, but only \u0027cause I\u0027d hate to not remember it. I hope I wasn\u0027t too disgraceful, Matthew.\" \"You were perfectly fine.\" \"I was not perfectly fine. I remember that much. Matthew, I said some hard things about Tommy. I was bad-mouthing him something awful, and I hope you know that was just the drink talking.\" \"I never thought otherwise.\" \"He treats me fine, you know. He\u0027s a good man. He\u0027s got his faults. He\u0027s strong, but he has his weaknesses.\" At a fellow police officer\u0027s wake, I once heard an Irish woman speak thus of the drink. \"Sure, it\u0027s a strong man\u0027s weakness,\" she had said. \"He cares for me,\" Carolyn said. \"Don\u0027t you pay any mind to what I said before.\" I told her I\u0027d never doubted he cared for her, and that I wasn\u0027t all that clear on what she had or hadn\u0027t said, that I\u0027d been hitting it pretty hard that night myself. SUNDAY night I walked over to Miss Kitty\u0027s. A light rain was falling but it didn\u0027t amount to much. I\u0027d stopped at Armstrong\u0027s first, briefly, and Miss Kitty\u0027s had the same Sunday-night feel to it. A handful of regulars and neighborhood people rode a mood that was the flip side of Thank God It\u0027s Friday. On the jukebox, a girl sang about having a brand-new pair of roller skates. Her voice seemed to slip in between the notes and find sounds that weren\u0027t on the scale. I didn\u0027t know the bartender. When I asked for Skip he pointed toward the office in back. Skip was there, and so was his partner. John Kasabian had a round face, and he wore wire-rimmed glasses with circular lenses that magnified his deep-set dark eyes. He was Skip\u0027s age or close to it, but he looked younger, an owlish schoolboy. He had tattoos on both forearms, and he didn\u0027t look at all to be the sort of person who got tattooed. One tattoo was a conventional if garish representation of a snake entwined around a dagger. The snake was ready to strike, and the tip of the dagger dripped blood. The other tattoo was simpler, even tasteful: a chain-link bracelet encircling his right wrist. \"If I\u0027d at least had it on the other wrist,\" he had said, \"at least the watch\u0027d cover it.\" I don\u0027t know how he really felt about the tattoos. He affected disdain for them, contempt for the young man who\u0027d elected to get himself thus branded, and sometimes he did seem genuinely embarrassed by them. At other times I sensed that he was proud of them. I didn\u0027t really know him all that well. His was a less expansive personality than Skip\u0027s. He didn\u0027t like to bounce around the bars, worked the early shift and did the marketing before that. And he wasn\u0027t the drinker his partner was. He liked his beer, but he didn\u0027t hit it the way Skip did. \"Matt,\" he said, and pointed to a chair. \"Glad you\u0027re going to help us with this.\" \"Whatever I can.\" \"It\u0027s tomorrow night,\" Skip said. \"We\u0027re supposed to be in this room, eight o\u0027clock sharp, phone\u0027s gonna ring.\" \"And?\" \"We get instructions. I should have a car ready. That\u0027s part of the instructions.\" \"Have you got a car?\" \"I got my car, it\u0027s no hassle having it ready.\" \"Has John got a car?\" \"I\u0027ll get it out of the garage,\" John said. \"You think we might want to take two cars?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-19.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
