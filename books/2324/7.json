And he wore a pinkie ring on his right hand, a high-school class ring, I think it must have been. I remembered it, sitting there over coffee in the Red Flame. A class ring with a blue stone on his right pinkie, a yellow gold band on his left ring finger.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t tell how I felt.\\n\\n THAT afternoon I went to St. Paul \u0027s and lit a candle for Margaret Tillary. I had discovered churches in my retirement, and while I did not pray or attend services, I dropped in now and then and sat in the darkened silence. Sometimes I lit candles for people who had recently died, or for those longer dead who were on my mind. I don\u0027t know why I thought this was something I ought to do, nor do I know why I felt compelled to tuck a tenth of any income I received into the poor box of whatever church I next visited.\\n\\n I sat in a rear pew and thought a bit about sudden death. When I left the church a light rain was falling. I crossed Ninth Avenue and ducked into Armstrong\u0027s. Dennis was behind the bar. I ordered bourbon neat, drank it straight down, and motioned for another and said I\u0027d have a cup of coffee with it.\\n\\n While I poured the bourbon into the coffee, he asked if I\u0027d heard about Tillary. I said I\u0027d read the story in the News.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a piece in this afternoon\u0027s Post, too. Pretty much the same story. It happened the night before last is how they figure it. He evidently didn\u0027t make it home and he went straight to the office in the morning, and then after he called a few times to apologize and couldn\u0027t get through, he got worried.\"\\n\\n \"It said that in the paper?\"\\n\\n \"Just about. That would have been the night before last. He didn\u0027t come in while I was here. Did you see him?\"\\n\\n I tried to remember. \"I think so. The night before last, yeah, I think he was here with Carolyn.\"\\n\\n \"The Dixie Belle.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the one.\"\\n\\n \"Wonder how she feels about now.\" He used thumb and forefinger to smooth the points of his wispy moustache. \"Probably guilty for having her wish come true.\"\\n\\n \"You think she wanted the wife dead?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Isn\u0027t that a girl\u0027s fantasy when she\u0027s running around with a married guy? Look, I\u0027m not married, what do I know about these things?\"\\n\\n THE story faded out of the papers during the next couple of days. There was a death notice in Thursday\u0027s News. Margaret Wayland Tillary, beloved wife of Thomas, mother of the late James Alan Tillary, aunt of Mrs. Richard Paulsen. There would be a wake that evening, a funeral service the following afternoon at Walter B. Cooke\u0027s, Fourth and Bay Ridge Avenues, in Brooklyn.\\n\\n That night Billie Keegan said, \"I haven\u0027t seen Tillary since it happened. I\u0027m not sure we\u0027re gonna see him again.\" He poured himself a glass of JJ\u0026S, the twelve-year-old Jameson that nobody else ever ordered. \"I bet we don\u0027t see him with her again.\"\\n\\n \"The girlfriend?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"What\u0027s got to be on both their minds is he was with her when his wife was getting knifed to death in Brooklyn. And if he\u0027d only been home where he was supposed to be, di dah di dah di dah. You\u0027re fooling around and you want a quick bounce and a couple of laughs, the last thing you need is something to remind you how you got your wife killed by fooling around.\"\\n\\n I thought about it, nodded. \"The wake was tonight,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yeah? You go?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t know anybody that went.\"\\n\\n I left before closing, I had a drink at Polly\u0027s and another at Miss Kitty\u0027s, Skip was tense and remote, I sat at the bar and tried to ignore the man standing next to me without being actively hostile. He wanted to tell me how all the city\u0027s problems were the fault of the former mayor. I didn\u0027t necessarily disagree but I didn\u0027t want to hear about it.\\n\\n I finished my drink and headed for the door. Halfway there Skip called my name. I turned and he motioned to me.\\n\\n I walked back to the bar. He said, \"This is the wrong time for it, but I\u0027d like to talk to you soon.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"Ask your advice, maybe throw a little work your way. You be around Jimmy\u0027s tomorrow afternoon?\"\\n\\n \"Probably,\" I said. \"If I don\u0027t go to the funeral.\"\\n\\n \"Who died?\"\\n\\n \"Tillary\u0027s wife.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, the funeral\u0027s tomorrow? Are you thinking about going? I didn\u0027t know you were that close to the guy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n \"Then why would you want to go? Forget it, not my business. I\u0027ll look for you at Armstrong\u0027s around two, two-thirty. If you\u0027re not there I\u0027ll catch you some other time.\"\\n\\n I was there when he came in the next day around two-thirty. I had just finished lunch and was sitting over a cup of coffee when Skip came in and scanned the room from the doorway. He saw me and came on over and sat down.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t go,\" he said. \"Well, it\u0027s no day for a funeral. I was just over at the gym, I felt silly sitting in the sauna after. The whole city\u0027s a sauna. What have you got there, some of that famous Kentucky coffee of yours?\"\\n\\n \"Just plain coffee.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027ll never do.\" He turned, beckoned the waitress. \"Let me have a Prior Dark,\" he told her, \"and bring my father here something to put in his coffee.\"\\n\\n She brought a shot for me and a beer for him. He poured it slowly against the side of the glass, examined the half-inch head, took a sip, put the glass down.\\n\\n He said, \"I might have a problem.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"This is confidential, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"You know much about the bar business?\"\\n\\n \"Just from the consumer\u0027s point of view.\"\\n\\n \"I like that. You know it\u0027s all cash.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"A lot of places take plastic. We don\u0027t. Strictly cash. Oh, if we know you we\u0027ll take your check, or if you run a tab, whatever. But it\u0027s basically a cash business. I\u0027d say ninety-five percent of our gross is cash. As a matter of fact it\u0027s probably higher than that.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n He took out a cigarette, tapped the end against his thumbnail. \"I hate talking about all this,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Then don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He lit the cigarette. \"Everybody skims,\" he said. \"A certain percentage of the take comes right off the top before it gets recorded. It doesn\u0027t get listed in the books, it doesn\u0027t get deposited, it doesn\u0027t exist. The dollar you don\u0027t declare is worth two dollars that you do, because you don\u0027t pay tax on it. You follow me?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not all that hard to follow, Skip.\"\\n\\n \"Everybody does it, Matt. The candy store, the newsie, everybody who takes in cash. Christ\u0027s sake, it\u0027s the American way- the president\u0027d cheat on his taxes if he could get by with it.\"\\n\\n \"The last one did.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t remind me. That asshole\u0027d give tax fraud a bad name.\" He sucked hard on the cigarette. \"We opened up, couple years ago, John kept the books. I yell at people, do the hiring and firing, he does the buying and keeps the books. Works out about right.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"Get to the point, right? Fuck it. From the beginning we keep two sets of books, one for us and one for Uncle.\" His face darkened and he shook his head. \"Never made sense to me. I figured keep one phony set and that\u0027s that, but he says you need honest books so you\u0027ll know how you\u0027re doing. That make sense to you? You count your money and you know how you\u0027re doing, you don\u0027t need two sets of books to tell you, but he\u0027s the guy with the business head, he knows these things, so I say fine, do it.\"\\n\\n He picked up his glass, drank some beer. \"They\u0027re gone,\" he said.\\n\\n \"The books.\"\\n\\n \"John comes in Saturday mornings, does the week\u0027s bookkeeping. Everything was fine this past Saturday. Day before yesterday he has to check something, looks for the books, no books.\"\\n\\n \"Both sets gone?\"\\n\\n \"Only the dark set, the honest set.\" He drank some beer, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"He spent a day taking Valium and going nuts by himself, then told me yesterday. And I been going nuts ever since.\"\\n\\n \"How bad is it, Skip?\"\\n\\n \"Aw, shit,\" he said. \"It\u0027s pretty bad. We could go away for it.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"It\u0027s all our records since we opened, and we been making money from the first week. I don\u0027t know why, it\u0027s just another joint, but we been pulling \u0027em in. And we\u0027ve been stealing with both hands. They come up with the books, we\u0027re fucking nailed, you know? You can\u0027t call it a mistake, it\u0027s all down there in black and white, one set of figures, and there\u0027s another completely different set on each year\u0027s tax return. You can\u0027t even make up a story, all you can do is ask \u0027em where they want you, Atlanta or Leavenworth.\"\\n\\n We sat silent for a few moments. I drank some of my coffee. He lit another cigarette and blew smoke at the ceiling. Music played on the tape deck, something contrapuntal with woodwinds.\\n\\n I said, \"What would you want me to do?\"\\n\\n \"Find out who took \u0027em. Get \u0027em back.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe John got rattled, misplaced them. He could have-\"\\n\\n He was shaking his head. \"I turned the office upside down yesterday afternoon. They\u0027re fuckin\u0027 gone.\"\\n\\n \"They just disappeared? No signs of forced entry? Where did you keep \u0027em, under lock and key?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re supposed to be locked up. Sometimes he would forget, leave \u0027em out, stick \u0027em in a desk drawer. You get careless, you know what I mean? You never have an incident, you take the whole thing for granted, and if you\u0027re rushed, you don\u0027t take the trouble to put things away where they belong. He tells me he locked up Saturday but in the next breath he admits maybe he didn\u0027t, it\u0027s a routine thing, he does the same thing every Saturday, so how do you remember one Saturday from the next? What\u0027s the difference? The stuff is capital-G Gone.\"\\n\\n \"So somebody took it.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"If they go to the IRS with it-\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027re dead. That\u0027s all. They can plant us next to whatsisname\u0027s wife, Tillary\u0027s. You miss the funeral, don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027ll understand.\"\\n\\n \"Was anything else missing, Skip?\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t seem to be.\"\\n\\n \"So it was a very specific theft. Somebody walked in, took the books, and left.\"\\n\\n \"Bingo.\"\\n\\n I worked it out in my mind. \"If it was somebody with a grudge against you, somebody you fired, say-\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I thought of that.\"\\n\\n \"If they go to the Feds, you\u0027ll know about it when a couple of guys in suits come around and show you their ID. They\u0027ll take all your records, slap a lien on your bank accounts, and whatever else they do.\"\\n\\n \"Keep talking, Matt. You\u0027re really making my day.\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s not somebody who\u0027s got a hardon for you, then it\u0027s somebody looking to turn a dollar.\"\\n\\n \"By selling the books.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n \"To us.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the ideal customers.\"\\n\\n \"I thought of that. So did Kasabian. Sit tight, he tells me. Sit tight, and whoever took \u0027em\u0027ll get in touch, and we worry about it then. Just sit tight in the meantime. Tight\u0027s no problem, it\u0027s the sitting that\u0027s getting to me. Can you get bail for cheating on taxes?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"Then I suppose I can get it and run out on it. Leave the country. Live the rest of my life in Nepal selling hash to hippies.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-7.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
