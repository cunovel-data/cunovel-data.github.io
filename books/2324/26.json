Stole the car a week ago, took it in for a tune-up. What else could they get charged with? Desecrating a church?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jesus,\" I said.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\\n\\n \"That church.\"\\n\\n \"What about it?\"\\n\\n \"Stop the car, Skip.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"Stop the car a minute, all right?\"\\n\\n \"You serious?\" He looked at me. \"You\u0027re serious,\" he said, and pulled over to the curb.\\n\\n I closed my eyes, tried to bring things into focus. \"The church,\" I said. \"What kind of church was it, did you happen to notice?\"\\n\\n \"They all look the same to me. It was, I don\u0027t know, brick, stone. What the hell\u0027s the difference?\"\\n\\n \"I mean was it Protestant or Catholic or what?\"\\n\\n \"How would I know which it was?\"\\n\\n \"There was one of those signs out in front. A glass case with white letters on a black background, tells you when the services are and what the sermon\u0027s going to be about.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s always about the same thing. Figure out all the things you like to do and don\u0027t do \u0027em.\"\\n\\n I could close my eyes and see the damn thing but I couldn\u0027t bring the letters into focus. \"You didn\u0027t notice?\"\\n\\n \"I had things on my mind, Matt. What fucking difference does it make?\"\\n\\n \"Was it Catholic?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. You got something for or against Catholic? The nuns hit you with a ruler when you were a kid? \u0027Impure thoughts, wham, take that, you little bastard.\u0027 You gonna be a while, Matt?\" I had my eyes closed, wrestling with memory, and I didn\u0027t answer him. \"Because there\u0027s a liquor store across the street, and much as I hate to spend money in Brooklyn, I think I\u0027m gonna. All right?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"You can pretend it\u0027s altar wine,\" he said.\\n\\n HE returned with a pint of Teacher\u0027s in a brown bag. He cracked the seal and uncapped the bottle without removing it from the bag, took a drink and gave it to me. I held on to it for a moment, then drank.\\n\\n \"We can go now,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Go where?\"\\n\\n \"Home. Back to Manhattan.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have to go back, make a novena or something?\"\\n\\n \"The church was some kind of Lutheran.\"\\n\\n \"And that means we can go to Manhattan.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n He started the engine, pulled out from the curb. He reached out a hand and I gave him the bottle and he drank and handed it back to me.\\n\\n He said, \"I don\u0027t mean to pry, Detective Scudder, but-\"\\n\\n \"But what was all that about?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"I feel silly mentioning it,\" I said. \"It\u0027s something Tillary told me a few days ago. I don\u0027t even know if it was true, but it was supposed to be a church in Bensonhurst.\"\\n\\n \"A Catholic one.\"\\n\\n \"It would have to be,\" I said, and I told him the story Tommy had told me, of the two kids who\u0027d burglarized a Mafia capo\u0027s mother\u0027s church, and what had supposedly been done to them in return.\\n\\n Skip said, \"Really? It really happened?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Neither does Tommy. Stories get around.\"\\n\\n \"Hung on meat hooks and fucking skinned alive-\"\\n\\n \"It might appeal to Tutto. They call him Dom the Butcher. I think he\u0027s got interests in the wholesale meat industry.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus. If that was his church-\"\\n\\n \"His mother\u0027s church.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever. You gonna hang on to that bottle until the glass melts?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"If that was his church, or his mother\u0027s church, or whatever it was-\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t want him to know we were there tonight while it got shot up. Not that it\u0027s the same as burglarizing the premises, but he still might take it personally. Who knows how he\u0027d react?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus.\"\\n\\n \"But it was definitely a Protestant church and his mother would go to a Catholic one. Even if it was Catholic, there\u0027s probably four or five Catholic churches in Bensonhurst. Maybe more, I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Someday we\u0027ll have to count \u0027em.\" He drew on his cigarette, coughed, tossed it out the window. \"Why would anybody do something like that?\"\\n\\n \"You mean-\"\\n\\n \"I mean hang two kids up and fucking skin \u0027em, that\u0027s what I mean. Why would somebody do that, two kids that all they did was stole some shit from a church?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I know why Tutto probably thought he was doing it.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"To teach them a lesson.\"\\n\\n He thought about this. \"Well, I bet it worked,\" he said. \"I bet those little fuckers never rob another church.\"\\n\\n Chapter 18\\n\\n By the time we were back home the pint of Teacher\u0027s was empty. I hadn\u0027t had much of it. Skip had kept chipping away at it, finally flipping it empty into the backseat. I guess he only threw them out the window on the other side of the river.\\n\\n We hadn\u0027t talked much since our conversation about Dom the Butcher. The booze was working in him now, showing up a little in his driving. He ran a couple of lights and took a corner a little wildly, but we didn\u0027t hit anything or anybody. Nor did we get flagged down by a traffic cop. You just about had to run down a nun to get cited for a moving violation that year in the city of New York.\\n\\n When we\u0027d pulled up in front of Miss Kitty\u0027s he leaned forward and put his elbows on the steering wheel. \"Well, the joint\u0027s still open,\" he said. \"I got a guy working the bar tonight, he probably took as much off of us as the boys from Bensonhurst. Come on in, I want to put the books away.\"\\n\\n In his office, I suggested he might want to put the ledger in the safe. He gave me a look and worked the combination dial. \"Just overnight,\" he said. \"Tomorrow all this shit goes down a couple different incinerators. No more honest books. All you do is leave yourself wide open.\"\\n\\n He put the books in the safe and started to close the big door. I put a hand on his arm to stop him. \"Maybe this should go in there,\" I said, and handed him the.45.\\n\\n \"Forgot about that,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t go in the safe. You gonna tell a holdup man, \u0027Please excuse me a minute, I wanna get the gun from the safe, blow your head off\u0027? We keep it behind the bar.\" He took it from me, then looked around for an inconspicuous way to carry it. There was a white paper bag on the desk, stained from the takeout coffee and sandwiches it had once held, and Skip put the gun in it.\\n\\n \"There,\" he said. He closed the safe, spun the dial, tugged the handle to make sure the lock had engaged. \"Perfect,\" he said. \"Now let me buy you a drink.\"\\n\\n We went out front and he slipped behind the bar, pouring out two drinks of the same scotch we\u0027d had in the car. \"Maybe you wanted bourbon,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t think, didn\u0027t think when I bought the bottle, either.\"\\n\\n \"This is fine.\"\\n\\n \"You sure?\" He moved off, put the gun somewhere behind the bar. The bartender he had on that night came over and wanted a conference with him, and they walked off and spoke for a few minutes. Skip came back and finished his drink and said he wanted to put his car in the parking garage before somebody towed it, but he\u0027d be back in a few minutes. Or I could come along for the ride.\\n\\n \"You go ahead,\" I told him. \"I may go on home myself.\"\\n\\n \"Make it an early night?\"\\n\\n \"Not the worst idea.\"\\n\\n \"No. Well, if you\u0027re gone when I get back I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t go right home. I hit a few joints first. Not Armstrong\u0027s. I didn\u0027t want any conversation. I didn\u0027t want to get drunk, either. I\u0027m not sure what I wanted.\\n\\n I was leaving Polly\u0027s Cage when I saw a car that looked like Tommy\u0027s Buick cruising west on Fifty-seventh. I didn\u0027t get a good look at the person behind the wheel. I walked along after it, saw it pull into a parking space in the middle of the next block. By the time the driver got out and locked up, I was close enough to see it was Tommy. He was wearing a jacket and tie and carrying two packages. One, fan-shaped, looked to be flowers.\\n\\n I watched him enter Carolyn\u0027s building.\\n\\n For some reason I went and stood on the sidewalk across the street from her building. I picked out her window, or what I decided was her window. Her light was on. I stood there for quite a while, until the light went out.\\n\\n I went to a pay phone, called 411. The Information operator reported to me that she did indeed have a listing for Carolyn Cheatham at the address I gave her, but that the number was unpublished. I called again, got a different operator, and went through the procedure a policeman uses to get an unlisted number. I got it and wrote it down in my notebook, on the same page with my witless little sketch of ears. They were, I thought, rather unremarkable ears. They would pass in a crowd.\\n\\n I put a dime in the phone and dialed the number. It rang four or five times, and then she picked it up and said hello. I don\u0027t know what the hell else I expected. I didn\u0027t say anything, and she said hello a second time and broke the connection.\\n\\n I felt tight across my upper back and in my shoulders. I wanted to go to some bucket of blood and get in a fight. I wanted to hit something.\\n\\n Where had the anger come from? I wanted to go up there and pull him off of her and hit him in the face, but what the hell had he done? A few days ago I\u0027d been angry with him for neglecting her. Now I was enraged because he wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n Was I jealous? But why? I wasn\u0027t interested in her.\\n\\n Crazy.\\n\\n I went and looked at her window again. The light was still out. An ambulance from Roosevelt sped down Ninth Avenue, its siren wailing. Rock music blared on the radio of a car waiting for the light to change. Then the car sped away and the ambulance siren faded in the distance, and for a moment the city seemed utterly silent. Then the silence, too, was gone, as I became aware again of all the background noises that never completely disappear.\\n\\n That song Keegan had played for me came into my mind. Not all of it. I couldn\u0027t get the tune right and I only remembered snatches of the lyrics. Something about a night of poetry and poses. Well, you could call it that. And knowing you\u0027re all alone when the sacred ginmill closes.\\n\\n I picked up some beer on the way home.\\n\\n Chapter 19\\n\\n The Sixth Precinct is housed on West Tenth Street between Bleecker and Hudson, in the Village. Years before, when I did a tour of duty there, it was in an ornate structure farther west on Charles Street. That building has since been converted into co-op apartments, and named the Gendarme.\\n\\n The new station house is an ugly modern building that no one will ever carve into apartments. I was there a little before noon on Tuesday and I walked past the front desk and straight to Eddie Koehler\u0027s office. I didn\u0027t have to ask, I knew where it was.\\n\\n He looked up from a report he\u0027d been reading, blinked at me. \"Thing about that door,\" he said, \"anybody could walk through it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re looking good, Eddie.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you know. Clean living. Sit down, Matt.\"\\n\\n I sat, and we talked a little. We went back a long ways, Eddie and I. When the small talk faded, he said, \"You just happened to be in the neighborhood, right?\"\\n\\n \"I just thought of you and figured you needed a new hat.\"\\n\\n \"In this weather?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe a panama. Nice straw, keep the sun off.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-26.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
