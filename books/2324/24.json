{"id":63082,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"The gun was tucked into the waistband of my slacks, the butt protruding, the whole thing positioned for a draw across the front of my body. I\u0027d have preferred to have it riding in a holster on my hip but I didn\u0027t have the choice. It got in the way as I walked, and when I was in the shadows at the side of the church I drew the gun and walked along holding it, but I didn\u0027t like that either, and I put it back where I\u0027d had it.\\n\\n The flight of stairs was steep. Concrete steps with a rusted iron railing that was loosely mounted into the surrounding brick. A bolt or two had evidently worked loose. I walked down the steps and felt myself disappearing into the darkness. There was a door at the bottom. I groped until I found the knob and I hesitated with my hand on it, listening carefully, trying to hear something within.\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n I turned the knob, eased the door inward just far enough to be sure that it was unlocked. Then I drew it shut and knocked on it.\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n I knocked again. This time I heard movement inside, and a voice called out something unintelligible. I turned the knob again and stepped through the doorway.\\n\\n The time I\u0027d spent in the pitch-dark stairwell had worked to my advantage. A little light filtered into the basement through the windows at the front, and my pupils had dilated enough to make use of it. I was standing in a room that must have measured about thirty by fifty feet. There were chairs and tables scattered around the floor. I pulled the door closed after me and moved into the shadows against one wall.\\n\\n A voice said, \"Devoe?\"\\n\\n \"Scudder,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Devoe?\"\\n\\n \"In the car.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" another voice said. I couldn\u0027t recognize either of them as the one I\u0027d heard over the phone, but it had been disguised, and for all I knew these voices were disguised, too. They didn\u0027t sound like New York but they didn\u0027t sound like anyplace else in particular, either.\\n\\n The first speaker said, \"You bring the money, Scudder?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in the car.\"\\n\\n \"With Devoe.\"\\n\\n \"With Devoe,\" I agreed.\\n\\n Still just the two speakers. One was at the far end of the room, the other to his right. I could place them by their voices but the darkness shrouded them, and one of them sounded as if he might be speaking from behind something, some upended table or something of the sort. If they came out where I could see them, I could draw the gun and throw down on them, shoot them if I had to. On the other hand, it was more than possible that they already had guns trained on me and could drop me where I stood before I got the gun out of my pants. And even if I shot first and got them both, there could be another couple of armed men standing in the shadows, and they could shoot me full of holes before I even knew they existed.\\n\\n Besides, I didn\u0027t want to shoot anybody. I just wanted to trade the money for the books and get the hell out of there.\\n\\n \"Tell your friend to bring the money,\" one of them said. I decided he might have been the voice on the phone, if he were to let his speech soften into a southern accent. \"Unless he wants the books sent to the IRS.\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t want that,\" I said. \"But he\u0027s not going to walk into a blind alley, either.\"\\n\\n \"Keep talking.\"\\n\\n \"First of all, put a light on. We don\u0027t want to do business in the dark.\"\\n\\n There was a whispered conference, then a fair amount of moving around. One of them flicked a wall switch and a fluorescent fixture in the center of the ceiling came on one tube at a time. There was a flickering quality to its light, the way fluorescents get when they\u0027re starting to go.\\n\\n I blinked, as much at what I saw as at the flickering light. For a moment I thought they were hippies or mountain men, some curious breed. Then I realized they were disguised.\\n\\n There were two of them, shorter than I, slender in build. Both wore full beards and fright wigs that started low on their foreheads and concealed not only their hair but the whole shapes of their heads. Between the low hairline and the beginning of the beard, each wore an oval mask over the eyes and the top half of the nose. The taller of the two, the one who\u0027d turned on the light, had a chrome-yellow wig and a black face mask. The other, half concealed by a table with chairs stacked on it, sported dark brown hair and a white mask. Both had black beards, and the short one had a gun in his hand.\\n\\n With the light on, I think we all three felt vulnerable, almost naked. I know I did, and there was a tension in their stance that indicated the same feeling. The one with the gun was not exactly training it on me, but neither was he pointing it in another direction altogether. Darkness had protected all three of us, and now we\u0027d flicked it aside.\\n\\n \"The trouble is we\u0027re afraid of each other,\" I told him. \"You\u0027re afraid we\u0027ll try to get the books without paying for them. We\u0027re afraid you\u0027ll rip us off for the money and give us nothing in return, hold us up again with the books or peddle them to somebody else.\"\\n\\n The tall one shook his head. \"This is a one-time deal.\"\\n\\n \"For both of us. We pay once and that\u0027s all. If you made a copy of the books, get rid of it.\"\\n\\n \"No copies.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" I said. \"You have the books here?\" The short one with the dark wig shoved a navy-blue laundry bag across the room with his foot. His partner hefted it, put it back on the floor. I said it could be anything, it could be laundry, and would they show me what was in the bag.\\n\\n \"When we see money,\" the tall one said, \"you get to see the books.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to examine them. Just take them out of the sack before I tell my friend to bring the money.\"\\n\\n They looked at each other. The one with the gun shrugged. He moved the pistol to cover me while the other one worked the drawstring on the laundry bag and withdrew a hinged-post bound ledger similar to the set of fake books I\u0027d seen on Skip\u0027s desk.\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said. \"Flick the light on and off three times.\"\\n\\n \"Who are you signaling?\"\\n\\n \"The Coast Guard.\"\\n\\n They exchanged glances, and the one by the light switch worked it up and down three times. The fluorescent fixture winked on and off in ragged fashion. The three of us stood awkwardly and waited what seemed like a long time. I wondered if Skip had seen the signal, wondered if he\u0027d had enough time alone in the car to lose his nerve.\\n\\n Then I heard him on the stairs and at the door. I called out to him to come in. The door opened and he entered, the attachй case in his left hand.\\n\\n He looked at me, then caught sight of the two of them in their beards and wigs and masks.\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" he said.\\n\\n I said, \"Each side will have one man to make the exchange and one to cover him. That way nobody will be able to take anybody off and the books and money will pass at the same time.\"\\n\\n The taller one, the one at the light switch, said, \"You sound like an old hand at this.\"\\n\\n \"I had time to think about it. Skip, I\u0027ll back you up. Bring the case over here, set it down by me. Good. Now you and one of our friends can set up a table in the middle of the room and clear some of the other furniture out from around it.\"\\n\\n The two of them looked at each other, and predictably the taller one kicked the laundry bag over to his partner and came forward. He asked what I wanted him to do and I put him and Skip to work rearranging the furniture.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what the union\u0027s going to say about this,\" he said. The beard hid his mouth, and the mask covered him around the eyes, but I sensed he was smiling.\\n\\n At my direction, he and Skip positioned a table in the center of the room, almost directly beneath the overhead light fixture. The table was eight feet long and four feet wide, placed to divide their side of the room from ours.\\n\\n I got down on one knee, crouched behind a nest of chairs. At the far end of the room, the one with the gun was similarly concealing himself. I called Skip back for the case full of money, sent the tall yellow-haired fellow for the books. Moving deliberately, each carried his part of the bargain to one end of the long table. Skip set the case down first, worked the buttons to release the catches. The man in the blond wig slipped the set of books out of the bag and put them down gently, then stepped back, his hands hovering.\\n\\n I had each of them retreat a few yards, then switch ends of the table. Skip opened the heavy ledger, made sure the books were the ones he\u0027d negotiated for. His opposite number opened the attachй case and took out a banded stack of bills. He riffled through it, put it back, took up another stack.\\n\\n \"Books are okay,\" Skip announced. He closed the heavy volume, got it into the laundry bag, hoisted it and started back toward me.\\n\\n The one with the gun said, \"Hold it.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\"\\n\\n \"Stay where you are until he counts it.\"\\n\\n \"I got to stand here while he counts fifty grand? Be serious.\"\\n\\n \"Take a fast count,\" the one with the gun told his partner. \"Make sure it\u0027s all money. We don\u0027t want to go home with a bag full of cut-up newspaper.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d really do that,\" Skip said. \"I\u0027d really walk up into a gun with a case full of fucking Monopoly money. Point that thing somewhere else, will you? It\u0027s getting on my nerves.\"\\n\\n There was no answer. Skip held his position, balanced on the balls of his feet. My back was cramping and my knee, the one I was kneeling on, was giving me a little trouble. Time came to a stop while the yellow-haired one flipped through the packets of money, assuring himself that none of it consisted of cut paper or one-dollar bills. He probably did this as quickly as he could but it seemed forever before he was satisfied, closing the case and engaging the clasps.\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said. \"Now the two of you-\"\\n\\n Skip said, \"Wait a minute. We get the laundry bag and they get the attachй case, right?\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So it seems uneven. That case was close to a hundred bucks and it\u0027s less than two years old, and how much could a laundry bag be worth? A couple of bucks, right?\"\\n\\n \"What are you getting at, Devoe?\"\\n\\n \"You could throw in something,\" he said, his voice tightening. \"You could tell me who set this up.\"\\n\\n They both looked hard at him.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know you,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know either of you. You ripped me off, fine, maybe your kid sister needs an operation or something. I mean everybody\u0027s gotta make a living, right?\"\\n\\n No answer.\\n\\n \"But somebody set this up, somebody I know, somebody who knows me. Tell me who. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n There was a long silence. Then the one with the brown wig said, \"Forget it,\" flat, final. Skip\u0027s shoulders dropped in resignation.\\n\\n \"We try,\" he said.\\n\\n And he and the man in the yellow wig backed away from the table, one with the attachй case and one with the laundry bag. I called the shots, sending Skip to the door he\u0027d come in, watching the other move not surprisingly through a curtained archway in the rear. Skip had the door open and was backing through it when the one in the dark wig said, \"Hold it.\"\\n\\n His long-barreled pistol had swung around to cover Skip, and for a moment I thought he was going to shoot. I got both hands on the.45 and took a bead on him. Then his gun swung to the side and he raised it and said, \"We leave first. Stay where you are for ten minutes. You got that?\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said.\\n\\n He pointed the gun at the ceiling, fired twice. The fluorescent tubes exploded overhead, plunging the room into darkness. The gunshots were loud and the exploding tubes were louder, but for some reason neither the noise nor the darkness rattled me. I watched as he moved to the archway, a shadow among shadows, and the.45 stayed centered on him and my finger stayed on the trigger. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-24.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \\n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
