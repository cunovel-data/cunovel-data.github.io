C. Fields: \"Participated in the sport of kings, made our contribution to the improvement of the breed, yes indeed.\"\n \"I was doing some work.\"\n \"I\u0027d have been better off working. Fucking Keegan, he\u0027s got a pocket full of miniatures, he\u0027s knocking \u0027em off one a race, he\u0027s got his pockets full of these little bottles. And he\u0027s betting horses on the basis of their names. There\u0027s this plater, Jill the Queen, hasn\u0027t won anything since Victoria was the queen, and Keegan remembers this girl named Jill he had this mad passion for in the sixth grade. So of course he bets the horse.\"\n \"And the horse wins.\"\n \"Of course the horse wins. The horse wins at something like twelve-to-one, and Keegan\u0027s got a ten-dollar win ticket on her, and he\u0027s saying he made a mistake. What mistake? \u0027Her name was Rita,\u0027 he says. \u0027It was her sister\u0027s name was Jill. I remembered it wrong.\u0027 \"\n \"That\u0027s Billie.\"\n \"Well, the whole afternoon was like that,\" Skip said. \"He bets his old girlfriends and their sisters and he drinks half a quart of whiskey out of these little bottles, and Ruslander and I both lose I don\u0027t know, a hundred, hundred and fifty, and fucking Billie Keegan wins six hundred dollars by betting on girls\u0027 names.\"\n \"How did you and Ruslander pick horses?\"\n \"Well, you know the actor. He hunches his shoulders and talks out of the side of his mouth like a tout, and he talks to a couple of horsey-looking guys and comes back with a tip. The guys he talks to are probably other actors.\"\n \"And you both followed his tips?\"\n \"Are you crazy? I bet scientific.\"\n \"You read the form?\"\n \"I can\u0027t make sense out of it. I watch which ones have the odds drop when the smart money comes in, and also I go down and watch \u0027em walk around, and I notice which one takes a good crap.\"\n \"Scientific.\"\n \"Absolutely. Who wants to invest serious money in some fucking constipated horse? Some steed wracked with irregularity? My horses\"- he lowered his eyes, mock-shy- \"are M/O-kay.\"\n \"And Keegan\u0027s crazy.\"\n \"You got it. The man trivializes a scientific pursuit.\" He leaned forward, ground out his cigarette. \"Ah, Jesus, I love this life,\" he said. \"I swear to God I was born for it. I spend half my life running my own saloon and the other half in other people\u0027s saloons, with a sunny afternoon away from it now and then to get close to nature and commune with God\u0027s handiwork.\" His eyes locked on mine. \"I love it,\" he said levelly. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m gonna pay those cock-suckers.\"\n \"You heard from them?\"\n \"Before we left for the track. They presented their nonnegotiable demands.\"\n \"How much?\"\n \"Enough to make my bets seem somehow beside the point. Who cares if you win or lose a hundred dollars? And I don\u0027t bet heavy, it\u0027s not fun once it gets into serious money. They want serious money.\"\n \"And you\u0027re going to pay it?\"\n He picked up his drink. \"We\u0027re meeting with some people tomorrow. The lawyer, the accountants. That\u0027s if Kasabian stops throwing up.\"\n \"And then?\"\n \"And then I suppose we try to negotiate the nonnegotiable, and then we fucking pay. What else are the lawyers and accountants going to tell us? Raise an army? Fight a guerrilla war? That\u0027s not the kind of answer you get from lawyers and accountants.\" He took another cigarette from the pack, tapped it, held it up, looked at it, tapped it again, then lit it. \"I\u0027m a machine that smokes and drinks,\" he said through a cloud of smoke, \"and I\u0027ll tell you, I don\u0027t know why I fucking bother with any of it.\"\n \"A minute ago you loved this life.\"\n \"Was I the one who said that? You know the story about the guy bought a Volkswagen and his friend asks him how does he like it? \u0027Well, it\u0027s like eating pussy,\u0027 the guy says. \u0027I\u0027m crazy about it, but I don\u0027t take a whole lot of pride in it.\u0027 \"\n Chapter 10\n I called Drew Kaplan the next morning before I went out to Brooklyn. His secretary said he was in a meeting, and could he call me back? I said I\u0027d call him back, and I did forty minutes later when I got off the subway in Sunset Park. By then he\u0027d gone for lunch. I told her I\u0027d call back later.\n That afternoon I managed to meet a woman who was friendly with Angel Herrera\u0027s girlfriend. She had strong Indio features and a face badly pitted by acne. She said it was a pity for Herrera that he had to go to jail, but it was probably good for her friend, because Herrera would never marry her or even live with her because he considered himself still married in Puerto Rico. \"An\u0027 his wife divorce him, but he doan accept it,\" she said. \"So my fren, she wanna get pregnant, but he doan get her pregnant and he woan marry her. What\u0027s she want with him, you know? Better for her if he goes away for a while. Better for everybody.\"\n I called Kaplan again from a street corner phone booth and reached him this time. I got out my notebook and gave him what I had. None of it added up to anything as far as I could see, except for Cruz\u0027s prior arrest for manslaughter, which was something he should have known about, as he was quick enough to point out himself. \"That\u0027s not something an investigator should have to come up with,\" he said. \"They should have put that on the table. True, you can\u0027t introduce it in court, but there\u0027s ways to use it. You may have earned your fee with that little bit of information. Not that I want to discourage you from digging for more.\"\n But when I\u0027d hung up the phone I didn\u0027t really feel like digging for more. I went over to the Fjord and had a couple of drinks, but then a lanky kid with a lot of yellow hair and a blond Zapata moustache came in and tried to hustle me into a game on the shuffle-bowling machine. I wasn\u0027t interested and neither was anyone else, so he went and played the thing by himself, feigning noisy drunkenness, I suppose in an attempt to look like easy pickings. The noise drove me out of there, and I wound up walking all the way to Tommy\u0027s house on Colonial Road.\n His key unlocked the front door. I walked in, half expecting the scene that had greeted the discoverer of Margaret Tillary\u0027s body, but of course things had been cleaned up and put right long ago, after the lab crew and the photographer had done their work and gone.\n I walked through the rooms on the ground floor, found the side entrance that led to a vestibule off the kitchen, walked back through the kitchen and the dining room, trying to imagine myself into Cruz and Herrera\u0027s shoes as they moved through the rooms of the empty house.\n Except it wouldn\u0027t have been empty. Margaret Tillary had been upstairs in her bedroom. Doing what? Sleeping? Watching television?\n I climbed the stairs. A couple of the boards creaked underfoot. Had they done so the night of the burglary? Had Peg Tillary heard, and had she reacted? Maybe she thought it was Tommy\u0027s step, got out of bed to greet him. Maybe she knew it was someone else. Footsteps are recognizable to some people, and a stranger\u0027s footfall is unfamiliar, enough so sometimes to intrude on sleep.\n She\u0027d been killed in the bedroom. Up the stairs, open the door, find a woman cowering in there and stab her? Or maybe she\u0027d come out of the bedroom door, expecting Tommy, or not expecting him but not thinking straight, confronting the burglar, people did that all the time, not thinking, outraged at the invasion of their home, acting as if their righteous indignation would serve them as armor.\n Then she\u0027d have seen the knife in his hand, and she\u0027d have gone back inside the room, tried to shut the door, maybe, and he\u0027d come in after her, and maybe she was screaming and he had to get to her to shut her up, and-\n I kept seeing Anita backing away from a knife, kept turning the scene into our bedroom in Syosset.\n Silly.\n I walked over to one of the dressers, opened drawers, closed them. Her dresser, long and low. His was a highboy in the same French Provincial styling, part of a suite with the bed and a nightstand and a mirrored dressing table. I opened and closed drawers in his dresser. He\u0027d left a lot of clothes behind, but he probably owned a lot of clothes.\n I opened the closet door. She could have hidden in the closet, though not comfortably. It was full, the shelf loaded with a couple dozen shoe boxes, the rack packed with clothes on hangers. He must have taken a couple of suits and jackets with him, but the clothes he\u0027d left behind were more than I owned.\n There were bottles of perfume on the dressing table. I lifted the stopper of one and held it to my nose. The scent was lily-of-the-valley.\n I was in the room for a long time. There are people who are psychically sensitive, they pick up things at a murder scene. Maybe everyone does, maybe the sensitive ones are simply better at figuring out what it is that they\u0027re attuned to. I had no illusions about my ability to glean vibrations from the room or the clothing or the furniture. Smell is the sense most directly hooked into the memory, but all her perfume did was remind me that an aunt of mine had smelled of that same floral scent.\n I don\u0027t know what I thought I was doing there.\n There was a television set in the bedroom. I turned it on, turned it off. She might have been watching it, she might not even have heard the burglar until he opened the door. But wouldn\u0027t he have heard the set? Why would he come into a room if he knew someone was there, when he could just slip away undetected?\n Of course he could have had rape in mind. There hadn\u0027t been any rape, none detected in the autopsy, although that hardly proved the absence of intent. He might have achieved sexual release from the murder, might have been turned off by the violence, might have…\n Tommy had slept in this room, had lived with the woman who smelled of lilies-of-the-valley. I knew him from the bars, I knew him with a girl on his arm and a drink in his hand and his laugh echoing off paneled walls. I didn\u0027t know him in a room like this, in a house like this.\n I went in and out of other rooms on the second floor. In what I suppose was the upstairs sitting room, photos in silver frames were grouped on top of a mahogany radio-phonograph console. There was a formal wedding picture, Tommy in a tuxedo, the bride in white with her bouquet all pink and white. Tommy was lean in the photo, and impossibly young. He was sporting a crew cut, which looked outlandish in 1975, especially in counterpoint to the formal clothes.\n Margaret Tillary- she might still have been Margaret Wayland when the photo was taken- had been a tall woman, with strong features even then. I looked at her and tried to imagine her with years added. She\u0027d probably put on a few pounds over the years. Most people did.\n Most of the other photos showed people I didn\u0027t recognize. Relatives, I suppose. I didn\u0027t notice any of the son Tommy\u0027d told me about.\n One door led to a linen closet, another to a bathroom. A third opened on a flight of stairs leading to the third floor. There was a bedroom up there, its window affording a good view of the park. I drew up an armchair, its seat and back worked in needlepoint, and watched the traffic on Colonial Road and a baseball game in the park.\n I imagined the aunt sitting as I was sitting, watching the world through her window. If I\u0027d heard her name I didn\u0027t remember it, and when I thought of her the image that came to mind was some sort of generic aunt, some combination of the various unidentifiable female faces in the photographs downstairs mixed, I suppose, with elements of some aunts of my own. She was gone now, this unnamed composite aunt, and her niece was gone, and before long the house would be sold and other people living in it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-15.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: \n When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
