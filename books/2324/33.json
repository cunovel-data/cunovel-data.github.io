{"id":63091,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\"Yes,\" I said. \"I know.\"\n The room got very quiet. I walked around the desk and took the bottle of Wild Turkey from the top of the file cabinet. I poured a couple of ounces into a rocks glass and put the bottle back. I held the glass without tasting the whiskey. I didn\u0027t want the drink so much as I wanted to stretch the moment and let the tension build.\n I said, \"The inside man had a role to play afterward, too. He had to let Atwood and Cutler know that we got their license number.\"\n Bobby said, \"I thought the car was stolen.\"\n \"The car was reported stolen. That\u0027s how it got on the hot-car sheet. Stolen between five and seven p.m. Monday from an address on Ocean Parkway.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"That was the report, and at the time I let it go at that. This afternoon I did what I probably should have done off the bat, and I got the name of the car\u0027s owner. It was Rita Donegian.\"\n \"Atwood\u0027s girlfriend,\" Skip said.\n \"Cutler\u0027s. Not that it makes a difference.\"\n \"I\u0027m confused,\" Kasabian said. \"He stole his girlfriend\u0027s car? I don\u0027t get it.\"\n \"Everyone picks on the Armenians,\" Keegan said.\n I said, \"They took her car. Atwood and Cutler took Rita Donegian\u0027s car. Afterward they got a call from their accomplice telling them that the plate had been spotted. So they called in then and reported it as having been stolen, and they said it had been taken thus and so many hours earlier, and from an address way out on Ocean Parkway. When I dug a little deeper this afternoon I managed to establish that the report of the theft hadn\u0027t been called in until close to midnight.\n \"I\u0027ve got things a little out of sequence. The hot-car sheet didn\u0027t carry the name of the Mercury\u0027s owner as Rita Donegian. It was an Irish name, Flaherty or Farley, I forget, and the address was the one on Ocean Parkway. There was a phone number, but it turned out to be wrong, and I couldn\u0027t pick up any listing for the Flaherty or Farley name at that address. So I checked Motor Vehicles, working from the plate number, and the car\u0027s owner turned out to be Rita Donegian with an address on Cabrini Boulevard, which is way up in Washington Heights and a long ways from Ocean Parkway or any other part of Brooklyn.\"\n I drank some of the Wild Turkey.\n \"I called Rita Donegian,\" I said. \"I represented myself as a cop checking the hot-car sheet automatically, making sure what cars have been recovered and what ones are still missing. Oh, yes, she said, they got the car back right away. She didn\u0027t think it was really stolen after all; her husband had a few drinks and forgot where he parked it, then found it a couple blocks away after she\u0027d gone and reported it stolen. I said we must have made a clerical error, we had the car listed as stolen in Brooklyn and here she was in upper Manhattan. No, she said, they were visiting her husband\u0027s brother in Brooklyn. I said we had an error in the name, too, that it was Flaherty, whatever the hell it was. No, she said, that was no error, that was the brother\u0027s name. Then she got a little rattled and explained it was her husband\u0027s brother-in-law, actually, that her husband\u0027s sister had married a man named Flaherty.\"\n \"A poor Armenian girl,\" Keegan said, \"gone to ruination with the Irish. Think of it, Johnny.\"\n Skip said, \"Was any of what she said true?\"\n \"I asked her if she was Rita Donegian and if she was the owner of a Mercury Marquis with the license number LJK-914. She said yes to both of those questions. That was the last time she told me the truth. She told a whole string of lies, and she knew she was covering for them or she\u0027d never have been so inventive. She hasn\u0027t got a husband. She might refer to Cutler as her husband but she was calling him Mr. Donegian, and the only Mr. Donegian is her father. I didn\u0027t want to push too hard because I didn\u0027t want her to get the idea that my call was anything beyond simple routine.\"\n Skip said, \"Somebody called them after the payoff. To tell them we had the plate number.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"So who knew? The five of us and who else? Keegan, did you get waxed and tell a roomful of people how you were the hero and wrote down the plate number? Is that what happened?\"\n \"I went to confession,\" Billie said, \"and I told Father O\u0027Houlihan.\"\n \"I\u0027m serious, goddammit.\"\n \"I never did trust the shifty-eyed bastard,\" Billie said.\n Gently, John Kasabian said, \"Skip, I don\u0027t think anybody told anybody. I think that\u0027s what Matt\u0027s leading up to. It was one of us, wasn\u0027t it, Matt?\"\n Skip said, \"One of us? One of us here?\"\n \"Wasn\u0027t it, Matt?\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" I said. \"It was Bobby.\"\n Chapter 23\n The silence stretched, with everybody looking at Bobby. Then Skip let out a fierce laugh that caromed wildly around the room.\n \"Matt, you fuck,\" he said. \"You had me going there. You just about had me buying it.\"\n \"It\u0027s true, Skip.\"\n \"Because I\u0027m an actor, Matt?\" Bobby grinned at me. \"You figure all actors know each other, the way Billie figured Kasabian would have to know the schoolteacher. For Christ\u0027s sake, there\u0027s probably more actors in this town than there are Armenians.\"\n \"Two much-maligned groups,\" Keegan intoned. \"Actors and Armenians, both of them much given to starving.\"\n \"I never heard of these guys,\" Bobby said. \"Atwood and Cutler? Are those their names? I never heard of either of them.\"\n I said, \"It won\u0027t wash, Bobby. You were in classes with Gary Atwood at the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts. You were in a showcase at the Galinda Theater on Second Avenue last year, and that was one of Lee David Cutler\u0027s credits.\"\n \"You\u0027re talking about that Strindberg thing? Six performances to a roomful of empty seats and not even the director knew what the play was supposed to be about? Oh, that was Cutler, the thin guy who played Berndt? Is that who you mean?\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"The Lee threw me. Everybody called him Dave. I suppose I remember him but-\"\n \"Bobby, you son of a bitch, you\u0027re lying! \"\n He turned, looked at Skip. He said, \"Am I, Arthur? Is that what you think?\"\n \"It\u0027s what I fucking know. I know you, I know you all my life. I know when you\u0027re lying.\"\n \"The Human Polygraph.\" He sighed. \"Happens you\u0027re right.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe it.\"\n \"Well, make up your mind, Arthur. You\u0027re a hard man to agree with. Either I\u0027m lying or I\u0027m not. Which way do you want it?\"\n \"You robbed me. You stole the books, you sold me down the fucking river. How could you do it? You little fuck, how could you do it?\"\n Skip was standing up. Bobby was still sitting in his chair, an empty glass in his hand. Keegan and John Kasabian were on either side of Bobby, but they drew a little ways away from him during this exchange, as if to give them room.\n I was standing to Skip\u0027s right, and I was watching Bobby. He took his time with the question, as if it deserved careful consideration.\n \"Well, hell,\" he said finally. \"Why would anybody do it? I wanted the money.\"\n \"How much did they give you?\"\n \"Not all that much, tell you the truth.\"\n \"How much?\"\n \"I wanted, you know, a third. They laughed. I wanted ten, they said five, we wound up at seven grand.\" He spread his hands. \"I\u0027m a lousy negotiator. I\u0027m an actor, I\u0027m not a businessman. What do I know about haggling?\"\n \"You screwed me for seven thousand dollars.\"\n \"Listen, I wish it was more. Believe me.\"\n \"Don\u0027t joke with me, you cocksucker.\"\n \"Then don\u0027t feed me straight lines, you asshole.\"\n Skip closed his eyes. The sweat was beading up on his forehead, and tendons showed in his neck. His hands knotted into fists, relaxed, knotted up again. He was breathing through his mouth like a fighter between rounds.\n He said, \"Why\u0027d you need the money?\"\n \"Well, see, my kid sister needs this operation, and-\"\n \"Bobby, don\u0027t clown with me. I\u0027ll fucking kill you, I swear it.\"\n \"Yeah? I needed the money, believe it. I was gonna need the operation. I was gonna get my legs broken.\"\n \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n \"I\u0027m talking about I borrowed five thousand dollars and put it into a cocaine deal and it fell in the shit, and I had to pay back the five because I didn\u0027t borrow it from Chase Manhattan. I haven\u0027t got that good of a friend there. I borrowed it from a guy out in Woodside who told me my legs were all the collateral I\u0027d need.\"\n \"What the hell were you doing in a coke deal?\"\n \"Trying to make a dollar for a change. Trying to get out from under.\"\n \"You make it sound like the American Dream.\"\n \"It was a fucking nightmare. The deal went in the toilet, I still owed the money, I had to come up with a hundred a week just to keep paying the vig. You know how it works. You pay a hundred a week forever and you still owe the five grand, and I can\u0027t cover my expenses to begin with, never mind finding another hundred a week. I was running behind, and there\u0027s interest on the interest, and the seven grand I got from Cutler and Atwood, it\u0027s fucking gone, man. I paid the shy six grand to get him off my back forever, I paid some other debts I owed, I got a couple hundred dollars in my wallet. That\u0027s what\u0027s left.\" He shrugged. \"Easy come, easy go. Right?\"\n Skip put a cigarette in his mouth and fumbled with his lighter. He dropped it, and when he reached to pick it up he accidentally kicked it under the desk. Kasabian put a hand on his shoulder to steady him, then lit a match and gave him a light. Billie Keegan got down on the floor and looked around until he found the lighter.\n Skip said, \"You know what you cost me?\"\n \"I cost you twenty grand. I cost John thirty.\"\n \"You cost us each twenty-five. I owe Johnny five, he knows he\u0027ll get it.\"\n \"Whatever you say.\"\n \"You cost us fifty thousand fucking dollars so you could wind up with seven. What am I talking about? You cost us fifty thousand dollars so you could wind up even.\"\n \"I said I got no head for business.\"\n \"You got no head at all, Bobby. You needed money, you could have sold your friends to Tim Pat Morrissey for ten grand. That\u0027s the reward he was offering, that\u0027s three thousand more than they gave you.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t gonna rat \u0027em out.\"\n \"No, of course not. But you\u0027d sell me\u0027n John down shit creek, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\n Bobby shrugged.\n Skip dropped his cigarette on the floor, stepped on it. \"You needed money,\" he said, \"why didn\u0027t you come and ask me for it? Will you just tell me that? You coulda come to me before you went to the shy. Or the shy\u0027s pushing you, you need money to cover, you could\u0027ve come to me then.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t want to ask you for the money.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t want to ask me for it. It\u0027s okay to steal it from me, but you didn\u0027t want to ask me for it.\"\n Bobby drew back his head. \"Yeah, that\u0027s right, Arrrr-thur. I didn\u0027t want to ask you for it.\"\n \"Did I ever refuse you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Did I ever make you crawl?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"When?\"\n \"All the time. Let the actor play bartender for a while. Let\u0027s put the actor behind the stick, hope he don\u0027t give away the whole store. It\u0027s a big joke, my acting. I\u0027m your little windup toy, your fucking pet actor.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-33.html","bookId":2324,"book":{"id":2324,"title":"When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6)","description":"Storyline: \n When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (Matthew Scudder #6) \n These were the dark days for Matthew Scudder.
