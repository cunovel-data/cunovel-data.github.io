I have occasion to know from my official relation to the school.” “Things have gone very smoothly. I believe the relations between the scholars and myself have been very friendly. Peter Groot was at first inclined to make trouble, but he is now one of my strongest supporters.” “You have certainly succeeded remarkably well, Mr. Howard. I was at first led to fear that, on account of your youth, you would be unable to maintain the necessary discipline, though I knew that your scholarship was all that was needed. But the result has proved that my fears were groundless. How has John progressed?” “He has made progress, General Wall, especially of late. I think he has been dissatisfied with me at times, and thought me too strict, but I wanted to make him thorough. He has good abilities, but at first he did not apply himself sufficiently.” “I think you are right, Mr. Howard,” said General Wall, who was a sensible man. “You have pursued the right course with him. I want him to become a thorough scholar. But my object in calling this evening was to ask you if you would agree to take the school next term.” “I hardly know what to say, General Wall. My plans are not fixed.” “I hope you will agree to do so. I shall be willing to add five dollars a month to your salary from my own purse.” “That is liberal, General Wall, and I think it very possible that I may be willing to remain here. How long will vacation be?” “Four weeks. During that time, if you are willing to teach my son an hour a day, I will pay your board here.” “If I were intending to remain in Portville I would accept the offer, but I shall spend the time in traveling.” “Indeed! In what direction?” Walter answered vaguely, for he was not willing to let General Wall know that he meant to visit the mines, in which they were mutually interested. “Then,” said the visitor, rising to go, “I will consider that you are engaged to teach the next term.” “Yes, sir, on this condition, that if circumstances arise, rendering it impossible, I may be released upon notifying you.” “But such circumstances are not likely to arise, are they, Mr. Howard?” “I think not.” “Well, I will trust that nothing will occur to prevent your remaining with us. Good-evening.” “Good-evening, sir.” Walter was gratified to receive so decided a mark of approval from the chairman of the trustees. He had undertaken a task in which few boys of his age would have succeeded, but his pluck and good judgment had carried him through. “What would my classmates at the Essex Classical Institute think, if they should hear of my setting up as a Western schoolmaster? They would be amused, I am sure,” he thought to himself. “We don’t know what we can do till we try. I have heard that said often, and now I know it to be so.” Next his thoughts reverted to Mr. Shaw’s letter, given in the last chapter, and he wrote the following answer: “My Dear Friend, Mr. Shaw:--I was very glad to get your letter, which I have considered carefully. I like your plan for me to visit the mines during my vacation, and I have decided to do so. I shall have four weeks, and that will be quite sufficient. General Wall, the chairman of the school trustees, has just called upon me, to engage me to teach the next term. He offers to pay me five dollars a month extra out of his own pocket. Of course, my success pleases me, especially as there was some disposition to make trouble at first. But I conciliated the ringleader, after beating him in a fair fight, and now he is my friend. “If we can’t do any better, we will take the three thousand dollars; but I hope that we may be able to obtain more. If I get it, I will devote it to educating myself, as you suggest. I feel more and more anxious to obtain a good education. “You will hear from me again as soon as I have any information to send. Give my regards to Mrs. Shaw, and consider me, with many thanks for your kind interest, “Your sincere friend, “Walter Conrad.” The next evening Walter was seated in the public room of the inn, when he overheard a conversation that interested him. It was between the landlord and a stout man with red whiskers, whom he had not seen before. “Have you seen General Wall yet, Mr. Carter?” asked the landlord. “Not yet. I went over there this afternoon, but found he had driven over to Plimpton. He wouldn’t have gone, if he had known I was coming,” he said, in a satisfied way. “I suppose you bring good news, then?” said the other. “Yes, I do.” “The mine is going to turn out well, then?” “No doubt of it. It is an excellent mine, and between you and me, our friend Wall is going to make a fortune, or he will, if he plays his cards right.” “Is that so?” “There’s no doubt of it. Why, he has managed to buy in for himself and friends about all the original shares, at two cents on a dollar, and he controls the whole thing.” “I shouldn’t have thought they would sell out.” “Bless you, they knew nothing of the mine; thought it was bu’st up, worth nothing. Most of them were glad to realize anything at all. You see we’ve kept the thing quiet. We knew all the while that the mine was good, but took good care not to find anything of value till we had run down the stock, and bought it for a song. We needed the money of the other stockholders to carry the thing on. Now we’re all ready to go ahead. There is only one cause of delay.” “What is that?” “There is a party at the East that owns a thousand shares; we have tried to secure it, offering three thousand dollars; but he fights shy.” “It’s worth--how much is it worth?” “We’ll give fifty dollars a share sooner than not get it. But there won’t be any need of that. He don’t know the value of his shares, and will sell out for five thousand sure. We don’t want to be too much in a hurry about it, or it might excite suspicion.” “Well, you’re in luck,” said the landlord. “I only wish I had some shares myself. You wouldn’t give me the address of that Eastern party, would you?” “I rather think not,” said the red-whiskered man, slapping the landlord on the shoulder. “You’re a deep one, but you don’t get round me quite so easy.” “I suppose you’ve got enough shares to make you independent, Mr. Carter?” “I had a hundred, but I managed to pick up five hundred more, at two dollars apiece. I wouldn’t sell ’em for fifty dollars a share.” “When are you going out to the mines again?” “In a week or two. I’ve got to go home to St. Paul, to see my family and transact a little business, and then I shall go back. I want to see General Wall and ascertain if he has succeeded in buying up those Eastern shares first.” “To whom do they belong?” “They were bought by a man named Conrad. He died, leaving a son--a mere boy--in charge of a village lawyer as guardian. The lawyer is a slow, cautious man, and we haven’t succeeded in getting him round yet, or hadn’t, at last accounts from the general. I may have to go East and interview him myself.” “Are they working the mine now?” “Yes; but we are not doing very much till that is decided. What time is it?” “Eight o’clock.” “The general was to be home at eight--so his wife said. I think I will go up there, as I want to be off in the morning stage, if possible. Can you let me have breakfast at half-past six?” “Certainly, Mr. Carter.” “All right. Just send somebody in time to wake me up for it. I am liable to oversleep myself.” “I won’t forget.” The man with the red whiskers rose, and, putting on his hat, took his way to the residence of General Wall. It may be imagined with what feelings Walter listened to the details of the plot by which he was to have lost his property. It was clear that the despised mining stock was worth fifty thousand dollars, and with the information he had acquired he could doubtless obtain that sum. He would be rich once more! How this would affect his plans he could not yet determine. One thing he did, however. He wrote another letter to Mr. Shaw, giving him a full account of what he had overheard, and asking his advice in the matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3004/82916.html","bookId":297,"book":{"id":297,"title":"Strive and Succeed or The Progress of Walter Conrad","description":"简介： As Walters success as a teacher at the West may seem to some improbable, in view of his youth, I am led to say that I know of more than one case equally remarkable, in particular that of a gentleman since prominent as a politician.
