{"id":29695,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII REFORMATION.","content":"The result of his conflict with the new teacher mortified Peter not a little. Had it been a close contest he would not have minded it so much, but the advantage was all on Walter’s side from the first, and, what was worse, all the scholars could see it. Peter had been tripped up by Phineas Morton, as we know, but the difference in size was such that it was no mortification. Now he recalled his boasts that he could “lick the master,” with some shame, since it had turned out that he was no match for him. When school was over, Peter slipped off alone, not caring for the company of his school companions. He was afraid they would twit him with his defeat. Defeat is a test of friendship, and even John Wall, since the ignominious failure of Peter, was disposed to be less intimate with him. He had been drawn toward him by the hope that he could successfully rebel against Walter’s authority. John was no less anxious for the new teacher’s failure, but he saw that Peter was not the one to bring it about. The next day Peter was walking slowly along to school, not quite decided whether he would not play truant, when he heard himself called by name. Looking around, he recognized the last one he wished to meet--the teacher. “He wants to crow over me,” he thought, hastily. But Walter advanced, smiling cordially. “Good-morning, Peter,” he said. “Morning,” muttered Peter. “I suppose you are on your way to school. I am glad to have your company.” “Are you?” asked Peter, superciliously, walking unwillingly by the side of his victor. Walter saw his feelings, and was resolved to change them, if possible. “You mustn’t bear a grudge against me, Peter, for our little difficulty yesterday.” “You wouldn’t have thrown me, if you hadn’t known how to box,” said Peter. “No, I don’t believe I should,” said Walter, frankly. “You are pretty strong, Peter.” “I thought I was strong as you,” said Peter, thawing a little. “I think you are, but strength isn’t everything. Do you know anything about boxing?” “No; I never had no chance to learn.” “I don’t pretend to know much about it myself,” said Walter. “Still, I know something about the first principles. I will teach you all I know, if you want to learn.” “Will you?” asked Peter, astonished. “With pleasure. It will be good practice for me.” “I shouldn’t think you would want to,” said Peter. “Why not?” “Because you can lick me now; but if I knew as much about boxing as you, perhaps you couldn’t.” “Oh,” said Walter, laughing, “there won’t be any need of it.” “Why not?” “Because you are going to be my friend.” “How do you know?” said Peter; but Walter saw a difference in his tone. “Because there is no reason why we should not be. I am a boy like yourself, and the only difference between us is that I have a better education.” “I don’t know very much,” said Peter. “But you want to know more, don’t you?” “Ye-es,” said Peter, hesitatingly. “Of course you do. You want to rise in the world, and you won’t be likely to do it without education. It’s the same way with me.” “Don’t you know enough?” asked Peter. “Far from enough. I want to go through college, but I must earn money enough, first. My father failed, or I should still have been studying. Now, Peter, as long as I remain here, I will do all I can to help you on, if you will work yourself.” Peter was not wholly bad. There was something in him that responded to this magnanimity of the teacher, whom he had striven to annoy. “I shouldn’t think you’d be so kind to me, Mr. Howard,” he said, “when I tried to trouble you so much.” “Oh, that’s gone by, Peter! I depend upon the older scholars, such as you and Phineas Morton, to help me, instead of hindering me. Will you do it, Peter?” “Yes, I will,” said Peter. “That’s right. Then we are friends.” He offered his hand to Peter, and the latter took it. He felt flattered at being classed with Phineas Morton. It gave him a feeling of importance to be called upon by the master for help. “If any of the boys make trouble, I’ll help you, Mr. Howard,” he volunteered. “Thank you, Peter. With you and Phineas on my side, I am not afraid of any trouble.” “When will you give me the first boxing lesson?” asked Peter. “To-night, after school, if you like.” “All right. I’ll stop.” Great were the surprise and curiosity of the scholars assembled in front of the schoolhouse when they saw Peter Groot and the “master” walking together, and apparently on friendly terms. They had speculated upon what course Peter would pursue, and whether he would venture to continue his annoyances, but they were far from imagining that there would be such a speedy reconciliation. Even now they hardly believed the evidence of their senses. When Walter had entered the schoolhouse, they crowded upon Peter with questions. “Did he give you a scolding, Peter?” asked Charles Carney. “Of course he didn’t,” said Peter. “What did he say?” “He promised to teach me to box.” “He did?” exclaimed Charles, in astonishment. “Yes, he’s goin’ to give me my first lesson to-night, after school.” “And you don’t hate him any more?” “No; he’s a tiptop feller. I’ll lick any boy that says he ain’t.” Among those who listened with astonishment to this sudden change of tone on Peter’s part was Phineas Morton, who had recovered from his headache, and had just heard an account of what had taken place the afternoon previous. “That’s the way to talk, Peter,” said Phineas. “We’re together in that. If we stand by Mr. Howard he’ll get along.” “That’s what he told me,” said Peter, gratified at his rising importance. “I’m goin’ to study hard, and see if I can’t be somebody.” “Then you may count me your friend, Peter. We won’t laugh at each other’s mistakes hereafter, but we’ll both see if we can’t improve.” Thus was Peter confirmed in his good resolutions. Walter had managed to strike the right chord, and produced a complete revulsion of feeling in his once rebellious pupil. There was one, however, who was not pleased at Peter’s change. This was John Wall. He did not want the new teacher to secure friends, and he was sorry for Peter’s defection. At recess he managed to speak to Peter alone. “It seems to me you’ve changed since yesterday, Peter,” he said, with a sneer. “So I have,” said Peter. “Was it the licking the teacher gave you that changed you?” asked John, with the same tone. “Look here, John Wall,” said Peter, “if you say that again, I’ll knock you over.” “I didn’t think you were going back on me, after all you said. I thought it must be because you was afraid.” “I ain’t afraid of you, as you’ll find out. You’re a mean feller, and a coward. You wanted me to get into a fight with the master, because you hated him, and didn’t dare to fight him yourself. I like him a good deal better than I do you.” “You may if you want to,” said John, mortified. “I’m a gentleman’s son, and I can get as many friends as I like.” “You ain’t a gentleman yourself, that’s sure.” John walked away in dudgeon. He saw that Peter had gone over to the enemy, and that Walter had conquered. There was no hope now of breaking down his authority. Whether he liked it or not, he must submit to be taught by a boy, and one that he did not like. Meanwhile Phineas Morton had gone up to the teacher’s desk. “Have you recovered from your headache, Mr. Morton?” asked Walter. “Yes, thank you, Mr. Howard. I find you gained a great victory while I was away.” Walter smiled. “What surprises me is that Peter has turned over to your side. I heard him threaten to lick any boy that said anything against you.” “Did he say that?” asked Walter. “Yes. How did you manage it, Mr. Howard?” “By letting him see that I was his friend.” “There’s a good deal in that,” said Phineas, thoughtfully. “But Peter’s a hard case. I didn’t think you could manage him.” “There is a good side to every one, if you can only find it.” “You won’t have any more trouble now, Mr. Howard. Peter has been the ringleader in all school disturbances, and now that you have won him over all will go smoothly.” Phineas Morton’s prediction was verified. For the remainder of the day, and for weeks to come, Peter exhibited an astonishing change. He studied well, and began to improve rapidly in his studies. He was a boy of good capacity, but had been perversely unwilling to exert himself hitherto. Walter encouraged him in every way, and strove to make him ambitious. He carried out his promise, and taught Peter what he knew of boxing, sending to a neighboring large town for boxing gloves. Peter learned rapidly, but Walter also profited by the practice he obtained, and kept a slight superiority over his pupil. So matters stood when Walter gained some information that led to important results. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3004/82914.html","bookId":297,"book":{"id":297,"title":"Strive and Succeed or The Progress of Walter Conrad","description":"简介： As Walters success as a teacher at the West may seem to some improbable, in view of his youth, I am led to say that I know of more than one case equally remarkable, in particular that of a gentleman since prominent as a politician.
