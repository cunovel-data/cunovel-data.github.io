Shall I tell her you\u0027ll call back?\"\n \"No. I\u0027ll take it.\" Jason picked up the phone. \"Paige?\"\n \"Jason ... I need you!\" She was sobbing.\n \"What happened?\"\n \"Can you come to the apartment?\"\n \"Of course. I\u0027ll be right there.\" He stood up. \"The meeting is over. We\u0027ll pick it up in the morning.\"\n Half an hour later, Jason was at the apartment. Paige opened the door and threw her arms around him. Her eyes were red from crying.\n \"What happened?\" Jason asked.\n \"It\u0027s awful! Dr. Barker told me I ... I killed a patient, and honestly, it ... it wasn\u0027t my fault!\" Her voice broke. \"I can\u0027t take any more of his ...\"\n \"Paige,\" Jason said gently, \"you\u0027ve told me how mean he always is. That\u0027s the man\u0027s character.\"\n Paige shook her head. \"It\u0027s more than that. He\u0027s been trying to force me out since the day I started working with him. Jason, if he were a bad doctor and didn\u0027t think I was any good, I wouldn\u0027t mind so much, but the man is brilliant. I have to respect his opinion. I just don\u0027t think I\u0027m good enough.\"\n \"Nonsense,\" Jason said angrily. \"Of course you are. Everyone I talk to says you\u0027re a wonderful doctor.\"\n \"Not Lawrence Barker.\"\n \"Forget Barker.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to,\" Paige said. \"I\u0027m quitting the hospital.\"\n Jason took her in his arms. \"Paige, I know you love the profession too much to give it up.\"\n \"I won\u0027t give it up. I just never want to see that hospital again.\"\n Jason took out a handkerchief and dried Paige\u0027s tears.\n \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you with all of this,\" Paige said.\n \"That\u0027s what husbands-to-be are for, isn\u0027t it?\"\n She managed a smile. \"I like the sound of that. All right.\" Paige took a deep breath. \"I feel better now. Thanks for talking to me. I telephoned Dr. Wallace and told him I was quitting. I\u0027m going over to the hospital and see him now.\"\n \"I\u0027ll see you at dinner tonight.\"\n Paige walked through the corridors of the hospital, knowing that she was seeing them for the last time. There were the familiar noises and the people hurrying up and down the corridors. It had become more of a home to her than she\u0027d realized. She thought of Jimmy and Chang, and all the wonderful doctors she had worked with. Darling Jason going on rounds with her in his white coat. She passed the cafeteria where she and Honey and Kat had had a hundred breakfasts, and the lounge, where they had tried to have a party. The corridors and rooms were full of so many memories. I\u0027m going to miss it, Paige thought, but I refuse to work under the same roof as that monster.\n She went up to Dr. Wallace\u0027s office. He was waiting for her.\n \"Well, I must say, your telephone call surprised me, Paige! Have you definitely made up your mind?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Benjamin Wallace sighed. \"Very well. Before you go, Dr. Barker would like to see you.\"\n \"I want to see him.\" All of Paige\u0027s pent-up anger boiled to the surface.\n \"He\u0027s in the lab. Well ... good luck.\"\n \"Thanks.\" Paige headed for the lab.\n Dr. Barker was examining some slides under a microscope when Paige entered. He looked up. \"I\u0027m told you\u0027ve decided to quit the hospital.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. You finally got your wish.\"\n \"And what was that?\" Barker asked.\n \"You\u0027ve wanted me out of here from the first moment you saw me. Well, you\u0027ve won. I can\u0027t fight you anymore. When you told me I killed your patient, I ...\" Paige\u0027s voice broke. \"I ...1 think you\u0027re a sadistic, cold-hearted son of a bitch, and I hate you.\"\n \"Sit down,\" Dr. Barker said.\n \"No. I have nothing more to say.\"\n \"Well, I have. Who the hell do you think you ...?\"\n He suddenly stopped and began to gasp.\n As Paige watched in horror, he clutched his heart and toppled over in his chair, his face twisted to one side in a horrible rictus.\n Paige was at his side instantly. \"Dr. Barker!\" She grabbed the telephone and shouted into it, \"Code Red! Code Red!\"\n Dr. Peterson said, \"He\u0027s suffered a massive stroke. It\u0027s too early to tell whether he\u0027s going to come out of it.\"\n It\u0027s my fault, Paige thought. I wanted him dead. She felt miserable.\n She went back to see Ben Wallace. \"I\u0027m sorry about what happened,\" Paige said. \"He was a good doctor.\"\n \"Yes. It\u0027s regrettable. Very ...\" Wallace studied her a moment. \"Paige, if Dr. Barker can\u0027t practice here anymore, would you consider staying on?\"\n Paige hesitated. \"Yes. Of course.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-28.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: \n Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
