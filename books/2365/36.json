He was going to have to put a stop to it. \"Send her in.\"\\n\\n When Paige walked into his office, Inspector Burns said, \"Look, doctor, I think this has gone far enough. Dr. Dolan called to complain about - \"\\n\\n \"I know how Ken Mallory did it!\" Her voice was charged with excitement. \"There was trichloroethylene in Kat\u0027s body.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Dr. Dolan told me that. But he said it couldn\u0027t have made her unconscious. He - \"\\n\\n \"Chloral hydrate turns into trichloroethylene!\" Paige said triumphantly. \"Mallory lied when he said he didn\u0027t go back into the apartment with Kat. He put chloral hydrate in her drink. It has no taste when you mix it with alcohol, and it only takes a few minutes for it to work. Then when she was unconscious, he killed her and made it look like a bungled abortion.\"\\n\\n \"Doctor, if you\u0027ll forgive my saying so, that\u0027s a hell of a lot of speculation.\"\\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t. He wrote the prescription for a patient named Spyros Levathes, but he never gave it to him.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"Because he couldn\u0027t have. I checked on Spyros Levathes. He has erythropoietic porphyria.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a genetic metabolic disorder. It causes photosensitivity and lesions, hypertension, tachycardia, and a few other unpleasant symptoms. It\u0027s the result of a defective gene.\"\\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Mallory didn\u0027t give his patient chloral hydrate because it would have killed him! Chloral hydrate is contraindicated for porphyria. It would have caused immediate convulsive seizures.\"\\n\\n For the first time, Inspector Burns was impressed. \"You\u0027ve really done your homework, haven\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Paige pressed on. \"Why would Ken Mallory go to a remote pharmacy and fill a prescription for a patient he knew he couldn\u0027t give it to? You\u0027ve got to arrest him.\"\\n\\n His fingers were drumming on his desk. \"It\u0027s not that simple.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to ...\"\\n\\n Inspector Burns raised a hand. \"All right. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll talk to the district attorney\u0027s office and see whether they think we have a case.\"\\n\\n Paige knew she had gone as far as she could. \"Thank you, inspector.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get back to you.\"\\n\\n After Paige Taylor left, Inspector Burns sat there thinking about their conversation. There was no hard evidence against Dr. Mallory, only the suspicions of a persistent woman. He reviewed the few facts that he had. Dr. Mallory had been engaged to Kat Hunter. Two days after she died, he was engaged to Alex Harrison\u0027s daughter. Interesting, but not against the law.\\n\\n Mallory had said that he dropped Dr. Hunter off at her front door and did not go into the apartment. Semen was found in her body, but he had a plausible explanation for that.\\n\\n Then there was the matter of the chloral hydrate. Mallory had written a prescription for a drug that could have killed his patient. Was he guilty of murder? Not guilty?\\n\\n Burns buzzed his secretary on the intercom. \"Barbara, get me an appointment with the district attorney this afternoon.\"\\n\\n There were four men in the office when Paige walked in: the district attorney, his assistant, a man named Warren, and Inspector Burns.\\n\\n \"Thank you for stopping by, Dr. Taylor,\" the district attorney said. \"Inspector Burns has been telling me of your interest in the death of Dr. Hunter. I can appreciate that. Dr. Hunter was your roommate, and you want to -see justice done.\"\\n\\n So they\u0027re going to arrest Ken Mallory after all!\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Paige said. \"There\u0027s no doubt about it. Dr. Mallory killed her. When you arrest him, he - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n Paige looked at him blankly. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t arrest Dr. Mallory.\"\\n\\n \"But why?\"\\n\\n \"We have no case.\"\\n\\n \"Of course you have!\" Paige exclaimed. \"The tri-chloroethylene proves that - \"\\n\\n \"Doctor, in a court of justice, ignorance of the law is no excuse. But ignorance in medicine is.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s simple. It means that Dr. Mallory could claim he made a mistake, that he didn\u0027t know what effect chloral hydrate would have on a patient with porphyria. No one could prove he was lying. It might prove that he\u0027s a lousy doctor, but it wouldn\u0027t prove that he\u0027s guilty of murder.\"\\n\\n Paige looked at him in frustration. \"You\u0027re going to let him get away with this?\"\\n\\n He studied her a moment. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m prepared to do. I\u0027ve discussed this with Inspector Burns. With your permission, we\u0027re going to send someone to your apartment to pick up the glasses in the bar. If we find any traces of chloral hydrate, we\u0027ll take the next step.\"\\n\\n \"What if he rinsed them out?\"\\n\\n Inspector Burns said dryly, \"I don\u0027t imagine he took the time to use a detergent. If he just rinsed out the glasses, we\u0027ll find what we\u0027re looking for.\"\\n\\n Two hours later, Inspector Burns was on the phone with Paige.\\n\\n \"We did a chemical analysis of all the glasses in the bar, doctor,\" Burns said.\\n\\n Paige steeled herself for disappointment.\\n\\n \"We found one with traces of chloral hydrate.\"\\n\\n Paige closed her eyes in a silent prayer of thanks.\\n\\n \"And there were fingerprints on that glass. We\u0027re going to check them against Dr. Mallory\u0027s prints.\"\\n\\n Paige felt a surge of excitement.\\n\\n The inspector went on, \"When he killed her - if he did kill her - he was wearing gloves, so his fingerprints wouldn\u0027t be on the curette. But he couldn\u0027t very well have served her a drink while he wore gloves, and he might not have worn them when he put the glass back on the shelf after rinsing it out.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Paige said. \"He couldn\u0027t, could he?\"\\n\\n \"I have to admit that in the beginning, I didn\u0027t believe your theory was going anywhere. I think now maybe Dr. Mallory could be our man. But proving it is going to be another matter.\" He continued, \"The district attorney is right. It would be a tricky business to bring Mallory to trial. He can still say that the prescription was for his patient. There\u0027s no law against making a medical mistake. I don\u0027t see how we - \"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute!\" Paige said excitedly. \"I think I know how!\"\\n\\n Ken Mallory was listening to Lauren on the telephone. \"Father and I found some office space that you\u0027re going to adore, darling! It\u0027s a beautiful suite in the 490 Post Building. I\u0027m going to hire a receptionist for you, someone not too pretty.\"\\n\\n Mallory laughed. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about that, baby. There isn\u0027t anyone in the world for me but you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m dying for you to come see it. Can you get away now?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m off in a couple of hours.\"\\n\\n \"Wonderful! Why don\u0027t you pick me up at the house?\"\\n\\n \"All right. I\u0027ll be there.\" Mallory replaced the telephone. It doesn\u0027t get any better than this, he thought. There is a God, and She loves me.\\n\\n He heard his name called over the PA system: \"Dr. Mallory ... Room 430 ... Dr. Mallory ... Room 430.\" He sat there daydreaming, thinking about the golden future that lay ahead of him. A beautiful suite in the 490 Post Building, filled with rich old ladies eager to throw their money at him. He heard his name called again. \"Dr. Mallory ... Room 430.\" He sighed and got to his feet. I\u0027ll be out of this goddam madhouse soon, he thought. He headed toward Room 430.\\n\\n A resident was waiting for him in the corridor, outside the room. \"I\u0027m afraid we have a problem here,\" he said. \"This is one of Dr. Peterson\u0027s patients, but Dr. Peterson isn\u0027t here. I\u0027m having an argument with one of the other doctors.\"\\n\\n They stepped inside. There were three people in the room - a man in bed, a male nurse, and a doctor Mallory had not met before.\\n\\n The resident said, \"This is Dr. Edwards. We need your advice, Dr. Mallory.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\\n\\n The resident explained. \"This patient is suffering from erythropoietic porphyria, and Dr. Edwards insists on giving him a sedative.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see any problem with that.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Dr. Edwards said. \"The man hasn\u0027t slept in forty-eight hours. I\u0027ve prescribed chloral hydrate for him so he can get some rest and ...\"\\n\\n Mallory was looking at him in astonishment. \"Are you out of your mind? That could kill him! He\u0027d have a convulsive seizure, tachycardia, and he\u0027d probably die. Where in hell did you study medicine?\"\\n\\n The man looked at Mallory and said quietly, \"I didn\u0027t.\" He flashed a badge. \"I\u0027m with the San Francisco Police Department, Homicide.\" He turned to the man in bed. \"Did you get that?\"\\n\\n The man pulled out a tape recorder from under the pillow. \"I got it.\"\\n\\n Mallory was looking from one to the other, frowning. \"I don\u0027t understand. What is this? What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n The inspector turned to Mallory. \"Dr. Mallory, you\u0027re under arrest for the murder of Dr. Kate Hunter.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-36.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \\n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \\n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \\n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \\n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
