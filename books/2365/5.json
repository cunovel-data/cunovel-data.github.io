{"id":68870,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"On Monday morning, three of Paige\u0027s patients\u0027 charts were missing, and Paige was blamed.\n On Wednesday, Paige was awakened at 4:00 A.M. in the on-call room. Sleepily, she picked up the telephone. \"Dr. Taylor.\"\n Silence.\n \"Hello ... hello.\"\n She could hear breathing at the other end of the line. And then there was a click.\n Paige lay awake for the rest of the night.\n In the morning, Paige said to Kat, \"I\u0027m either becoming paranoid or someone hates me.\" She told Kat what had happened.\n \"Patients sometimes get grudges against doctors,\" Kat said. \"Can you think of anyone who ...?\"\n Paige sighed. \" Dozens.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\n Paige wished that she could believe it.\n In the late summer, the magic telegram arrived. It was waiting for Paige when she returned to the apartment late at night. It read: \"Arriving San Francisco noon Sunday. Can\u0027t wait to see you. Love, Alfred.\"\n He was finally on his way back to her! Paige read the telegram again and again, her excitement growing each time. Alfred! His name conjured up a tumbling kaleidoscope of exciting memories ...\n Paige and Alfred had grown up together. Their fathers were part of a medical cadre of WHO that traveled to Third World countries, fighting exotic and virulent diseases. Paige and her mother accompanied Dr. Taylor, who headed the team.\n Paige and Alfred had had a fantasy childhood. In India, Paige learned to speak Hindi. At the age of two, she knew that the name for the bamboo hut they lived in was basha. Her father was gorasahib, a white man, and she was nani, a little sister. They addressed Paige\u0027s father as abadhan, the leader, or baba, father.\n When Paige\u0027s parents were not around, she drank bhanga, an intoxicating drink made with hashish leaves, and ate chapati with ghi.\n And then they were on their way to Africa. Off to another adventure!\n Paige and Alfred became used to swimming and bathing in rivers that had crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Their pets were baby zebras and cheetahs and snakes. They grew up in windowless round huts made of wattle and daub, with packed dirt floors and conical thatched roofs. Someday, Paige vowed to herself, I\u0027m going to live in a real house, a beautiful cottage with a green lawn and a white picket fence.\n To the doctors and nurses, it was a difficult, frustrating life. But to the two children, it was a constant adventure, living in the land of lions, giraffes, and elephants. They went to primitive cinder-block school-houses, and when none was available, they had tutors.\n Paige was a bright child, and her mind was a sponge, absorbing everything. Alfred adored her.\n \"I\u0027m going to marry you one day, Paige,\" he said when she was twelve, he fourteen.\n \"I\u0027m going to marry you, too, Alfred.\"\n They were two serious children, determined to spend the rest of their lives together.\n The doctors from WHO were selfless, dedicated men and women who devoted their lives to their work. They often worked under nearly impossible circumstances. In Africa, they had to compete with wogesha - the native medical practitioners whose primitive remedies were passed on from father to son, and often had deadly effects. The Masai\u0027s traditional remedy for flesh wounds was olkilorite, a mixture of cattle blood, raw meat, and essence of a mysterious root.\n The Kikuyu remedy for smallpox was to have children drive out the sickness with sticks.\n \"You must stop that,\" Dr. Taylor would tell them. \"It doesn\u0027t help.\"\n \"Better than having you stick sharp needles in our skin,\" they would reply.\n The dispensaries were tables lined up under the trees, for surgery. The doctors saw hundreds of patients a day, and there was always a long line waiting to see them - lepers, natives with tubercular lungs, whooping cough, smallpox, dysentery.\n Paige and Alfred were inseparable. As they grew older, they would walk to the market together, to a village miles away. And they would talk about their plans for the future.\n Medicine was a part of Paige\u0027s early life. She learned to care for patients, to give shots and dispense medications, and she anticipated ways to help her father.\n Paige loved her father. Curt Taylor was the caring, selfless man she had ever known. He genuim liked people, dedicating his life to helping those wl needed him, and he instilled that passion in Paige, spite of the long hours he worked, he managed to time to spend with his daughter. He made the discomft of the primitive places they lived in fun.\n Paige\u0027s relationship with her mother was something else. Her mother was a beauty from a wealthy social background. Her cool aloofness kept Paige at a distance, Marrying a doctor who was going to work in far-off exotic places had seemed romantic to her, but the harsh reality had embittered her. She was not a warm, loving woman, and she seemed to Paige always to be complaining.\n \"Why did we ever have to come to this godforsaken! place, Curt?\"\n \"The people here live like animals. We\u0027re going catch some of their awful diseases.\"\n \"Why can\u0027t you practice medicine in the United States and make money like other doctors?\"\n And on and on it went.\n The more her mother criticized him, the more Paige adored her father.\n When Paige was fifteen years old, her mother disappeared with the owner of a large cocoa plantation in Brazil.\n \"She\u0027s not coming back, is she?\" Paige asked.\n \"No, darling. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad!\" She had not meant to say that. She was hurt that her mother had cared so little for her and her father that she had abandoned them.\n The experience made Paige draw even closer to Alfred Turner. They played games together and went on expeditions together, and shared their dreams.\n \"I\u0027m going to be a doctor, too, when I grow up,\" Alfred confided. \"We\u0027ll get married, and we\u0027ll work together.\"\n \"And we\u0027ll have lots of children!\"\n \"Sure. If you like.\"\n On the night of Paige\u0027s sixteenth birthday, their lifelong emotional intimacy exploded into a new dimension. At a little village in East Africa, the doctors had been called away on an emergency, because of an epidemic, and Paige, Alfred, and a cook were the only ones left in camp.\n They had had dinner and gone to bed. But in the middle of the night Paige had been awakened in her tent by the faraway thunder of stampeding animals. She lay there, and as the minutes went by and the sound of the stampede came closer, she began to grow afraid. Her breath quickened. There was no telling when her father and the others would return.\n She got up. Alfred\u0027s tent was only a few feet away. Terrified, Paige got up, raised the flap of the tent, and ran to Alfred\u0027s tent.\n He was asleep.\n \"Alfred!\"\n He sat up, instantly awake. \"Paige? Is anything wrong?\"\n \"I\u0027m frightened. Could I get into bed with you for a while?\"\n \"Sure.\" They lay there, listening to the animals charging through the brush.\n In a few minutes, the sounds began to die away.\n Alfred became conscious of Paige\u0027s warm body lying next to him.\n \"Paige, I think you\u0027d better go back to your tent.\" Paige could feel his male hardness pressing against her.\n All the physical needs that had been building up within them came boiling to the surface.\n \"Alfred.\"\n \"Yes?\" His voice was husky.\n \"We\u0027re getting married, aren\u0027t we?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Then it\u0027s all right.\"\n And the sounds of the jungle around them disappeared, and they began to explore and discover a world no one had ever possessed but themselves. They were the first lovers in the world, and they gloried in the wonderful miracle of it.\n At dawn, Paige crept back to her tent and she thought, happily, I\u0027m a woman now.\n From time to time, Curt Taylor suggested to Paige that she return to the United States to live with his brother in his beautiful home in Deerfield, north of Chicago.\n \"Why?\" Paige would ask.\n \"So that you can grow up to be a proper young lady.\"\n \"I am a proper young lady.\"\n \"Proper young ladies don\u0027t tease wild monkeys and try to ride baby zebras.\"\n Her answer was always the same. \"I won\u0027t leave you.\"\n When Paige was seventeen, the WHO team went to a jungle village in South Africa to fight a typhoid epidemic. Making the situation even more perilous was the fact that shortly after the doctors arrived, war broke out between two local tribes. Curt Taylor was warned to leave.\n \"I can\u0027t, for God\u0027s sake. I have patients who will die if I desert them.\"\n Four days later, the village came under attack. Paige and her father huddled in their little hut, listening to the yelling and the sounds of gunfire outside.\n Paige was terrified. \"They\u0027re going to kill us!\"\n Her father had taken her in his arms. \"They won\u0027t harm us, darling. We\u0027re here to help them. They know we\u0027re their friends.\"\n And he had been right.\n The chief of one of the tribes had burst into the hut with some of his warriors. \"Do not worry. We guard you.\" And they had.\n The fighting and shooting finally stopped, but in the morning Curt Taylor made a decision.\n He sent a message to his brother. Sending Paige out on next plane. Will wire details. Please meet her at airport.\n Paige was furious when she heard the news. She was taken, sobbing wildly, to the dusty little airport where a Piper Cub was waiting to fly her to a town where she could catch a plane to Johannesburg.\n \"You\u0027re sending me away because you want to get rid of me!\" she cried.\n Her father held her close in his arms. \"I love you more than anything in the world, baby. I\u0027ll miss you every minute. But I\u0027ll be going back to the States soon, and we\u0027ll be together again.\"\n \"Promise?\"\n \"Promise.\"\n Alfred was there to see Paige off.\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Alfred told Paige. \"I\u0027ll come and get you as soon as I can. Will you wait for me?\"\n It was a pretty silly question, after all those years.\n \"Of course I will.\"\n Three days later, when Paige\u0027s plane arrived at O\u0027Hare Airport in Chicago, Paige\u0027s Uncle Richard was there to greet her. Paige had never met him. All she knew about him was that he was a very wealthy businessman whose wife had died several years earlier. \"He\u0027s the successful one in the family,\" Paige\u0027s father\n always said. Paige\u0027s uncle\u0027s first words stunned her. \"I\u0027m sorry to tell you this, Paige, but I just received word that your father was killed in a native uprising.\"\n Her whole world had been shattered in an instant. The ache was so strong that she did not think she could bear it. I won\u0027t let my uncle see me cry, Paige vowed. I won\u0027t. I never should have left. I\u0027m going back there.\n Driving from the airport, Paige stared out the window, looking at the heavy traffic.\n \"I hate Chicago.\"\n \"Why, Paige?\"\n \"It\u0027s a jungle.\"\n Richard would not permit Paige to return to Africa for her father\u0027s funeral, and that infuriated her.\n He tried to reason with her. \"Paige, they\u0027ve already buried your father. There\u0027s no point in your going back.\" But there was a point: Alfred was there.\n A few days after Paige arrived, her uncle sat down with her to discuss her future.\n \"There\u0027s nothing to discuss,\" Paige informed him. \"I\u0027m going to be a doctor.\"\n At twenty-one, when Paige finished college, she applied to ten medical schools and was accepted by all of them. She chose a school in Boston.\n It took two days to reach Alfred by telephone in Zaire, where he was working part-time with a WHO unit.\n When Paige told him the news, he said, \"That\u0027s wonderful, darling. I\u0027m nearly finished with my medical courses. I\u0027ll stay with WHO for a while, but in a few years we\u0027ll be practicing together.\"\n Together. The magical word. \"Paige, I\u0027m desperate to see you. If I can get out a few days, could you meet me in Hawaii?\" There wasn\u0027t the slightest hesitation. \"Yes.\" And they had both managed it. Later, Paige could ly imagine how difficult it must have been for Alfred to make the long journey, but he never mentioned it.\n They spent three incredible days at a small hotel in Hawaii, called Sunny Cove, and it was as though they had never been apart. Paige wanted so much to ask Alfred to go back to Boston with her, but she knew how selfish that would have been. The work that he was doing was far more important.\n On their last day together, as they were getting dressed, Paige asked, \"Where will they be sending you, Alfred?\"\n \"Gambia, or maybe Bangladesh.\" To save lives, to help those who so desperately need him. She held him tightly and closed her eyes. She never wanted to let him go.\n As though reading her thoughts, he said, \"I\u0027ll never let you get away.\"\n Paige started medical school, and she and Alfred corresponded regularly. No matter in what part of the world he was, Alfred managed to telephone Paige on her birthday and at Christmas. Just before New Year\u0027s Eve, when Paige was in her second year of school, Alfred telephoned.\n \"Paige?\"\n \"Darling! Where are you?\"\n \"I\u0027m in Senegal. I figured out it\u0027s only eighty-eight hundred miles from the Sunny Cove hotel.\"\n It took a minute for it to sink in.\n \"Do you mean ...?\"\n \"Can you meet me in Hawaii for New Year\u0027s Eve?\"\n \"Oh, yes! Yes!\"\n Alfred traveled nearly halfway around the world to meet her, and this time the magic was even stronger. Time had stood still for both of them.\n \"Next year I\u0027ll be in charge of my own cadre at WHO,\" Alfred said. \"When you finish school, I want us to get married. ...\"\n They were able to get together once more, and when they weren\u0027t able to meet, their letters spanned time and space.\n All those years he had worked as a doctor in Third World countries, like his father and Paige\u0027s father, doing the wonderful work that they did. And now, at last, he was coming home to her.\n As Paige read Alfred\u0027s telegram for the fifth time, she thought, He\u0027s coming to San Francisco!\n Kat and Honey were in their bedrooms, asleep. Paige shook them awake. \"Alfred\u0027s coming! He\u0027s coming! He\u0027ll be here Sunday!\"\n \"Wonderful,\" Kat mumbled. \"Why don\u0027t you wake me up Sunday? I just got to bed.\"\n Honey was more responsive. She sat up and said, \"That\u0027s great! I\u0027m dying to meet him. How long since you\u0027ve seen him?\"\n \"Two years,\" Paige said, \"but we\u0027ve always stayed in touch.\"\n \"You\u0027re a lucky girl,\" Kat sighed. \"Well, we\u0027re all awake now. I\u0027ll put on some coffee.\"\n The three of them sat around the kitchen table.\n \"Why don\u0027t we give Alfred a party?\" Honey suggested. \"Kind of a \u0027Welcome to the Groom\u0027 party.\"\n \"That\u0027s a good idea,\" Kat agreed.\n \"We\u0027ll make it a real celebration - a cake, balloons - the works!\"\n \"We\u0027ll cook dinner for him here,\" Honey said.\n Kat shook her head. \"I\u0027ve tasted your cooking. Let\u0027s send out for food.\"\n Sunday was four days away, and they spent all their spare time discussing Alfred\u0027s arrival. By some miracle, the three of them were off duty on Sunday.\n Saturday, Paige managed to get to a beauty salon. She went shopping and splurged on a new dress.\n \"Do I look all right? Do you think he\u0027ll like it?\"\n \"You look sensational!\" Honey assured her. \"I hope he deserves you.\"\n Paige smiled. \"I hope I deserve him. You\u0027ll love him. He\u0027s fantastic!\"\n On The Sunday, an elaborate lunch they had ordered was laid out on the dining-room table, with a bottle of iced champagne. The women stood around, nervously waiting for Alfred\u0027s arrival.\n At two o\u0027clock, the doorbell rang, and Paige ran to the door to open it. There was Alfred. A bit tired-looking, a little thinner. But he was her Alfred. Standing next to him was a brunette who appeared to be in her thirties.\n \"Paige!\" Alfred exclaimed.\n Paige threw her arms around him. Then she turned to Honey and Kat and said proudly, \"This is Alfred Turner. Alfred, these are my roommates, Honey Taft and Kat Hunter.\"\n \"Pleased to meet you,\" Alfred said. He turned to the woman at his side. \"And this is Karen Turner. My wife.\" The three women stood there, frozen. Paige said slowly, \"Your wife?\" \"Yes.\" He frowned. \"Didn\u0027t... didn\u0027t you get my letter?\" \"Letter?\"\n \"Yes. I sent it several weeks ago.\" \"No ...\"\n \"Oh. I ... I\u0027m terribly sorry. I explained it all in my ... but of course, if you didn\u0027t get the ...\" His voice trailed off... . \"I\u0027m really sorry, Paige. You and I have been apart so long, that I ... and then I met Karen ... and you know how it is ...\"\n \"I know how it is,\" Paige said numbly. She turned to Karen and forced a smile. \"I ... I hope you and Alfred will be very happy.\" \"Thank you.\"\n There was an awkward silence. Karen said, \"I think we had better go, darling.\" \"Yes. I think you had,\" Kat said. Alfred ran his fingers through his hair. \"I\u0027m really sorry, Paige. I ... well ... goodbye.\" \"Goodbye, Alfred.\"\n The three women stood there, watching the departing newly weds.\n \"That bastard!\" Kat said. \"What a lousy thing to do.\"\n Paige\u0027s eyes were brimming with tears. \"I ... he didn\u0027t mean to ... I mean ... he must have explained everything in his letter.\"\n Honey put her arms around Paige. \"There ought to be a law that all men should be castrated.\"\n \"I\u0027ll drink to that,\" Kat said.\n \"Excuse me,\" Paige said. She hurried to her bedroom and closed the door behind her.\n She did not come out for the rest of the day. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-5.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: \n Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
