{"id":68899,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Mallory was seated across from Kat at Schroeder\u0027s restaurant on Front Street. It\u0027s the bottom of the ninth, he thought, and so far it\u0027s a shutout. What was going to happen when he couldn\u0027t pay the ten thousand dollars? Word would spread quickly around the hospital, and he would become known as a welcher, a sick joke. Kat was chatting about one of her patients, and Mallory was looking into her eyes, not hearing a word she said. He had more important things on his mind. Dinner was almost over, and the waiter was serving coffee. Kat looked at her watch. \"I have an early call, Ken. I think we\u0027d better go.\" He sat there, staring down at the table. \"Kat ...\" He looked up. \"There\u0027s something I have to tell you.\" \"Yes?\" \"I have a confession to make.\" He took a deep breath. \"This isn\u0027t easy for me.\" She watched him, puzzled. \"What is it?\" \"I\u0027m embarrassed to tell you.\" He was fumbling for words. \"I ... I made a stupid bet with some of the doctors that ... that I could take you to bed.\" Kat was staring at him. \"You ...\" \"Please don\u0027t say anything yet. I\u0027m so ashamed of what I did. It started out as a kind of joke, but the joke is on me. Something happened that I didn\u0027t count on. I fell in love with you.\" \"Ken ...\" \"I\u0027ve never been in love before, Kat. I\u0027ve known a lot of women, but never felt anything like this. I haven\u0027t been able to stop thinking about you.\" He took a shaky breath. \"I want to marry you.\" Kat\u0027s mind was spinning. Everything was being turned topsy-turvy. \"I ...1 don\u0027t know what to ...\" \"You\u0027re the only woman I\u0027ve ever proposed to. Please say yes. Will you marry me, Kat?\" So he had really meant all the lovely things he had said to her! Her heart was pounding. It was like a wonderful dream suddenly come true. All she had wanted from him was honesty. And now he was being honest with her. All this time he had been feeling guilty about what he had done. He was not like other men. He was genuine, and sensitive. When Kat looked at him, her eyes were glowing. \"Yes, Ken. Oh, yes!\" His grin lit up the room. \"Kat ...\"He leaned over and kissed her. \"I\u0027m so sorry about that stupid bet.\" He shook his head in self-derision. \"Ten thousand dollars. We could have used that money for our honeymoon. But it\u0027s worth losing it to have you.\" Kat was thinking, Ten thousand dollars. \"I was such a fool.\" \"When is your deadline up?\" \"At midnight tonight, but that\u0027s not important anymore. The important thing is us. That we\u0027re going to be married. We - \" \"Ken?\" \"Yes, darling?\" \"Let\u0027s go to your place.\" There was a mischievous glint in Kat\u0027s eyes. \"You still have time to win your bet.\" Kat was a tigress in bed. My God! This was worth waiting for, Mallory thought. All the feelings that Kat had kept bottled up over the years suddenly exploded. She was the most passionate woman Ken Mallory had ever known. At the end of two hours, he was exhausted. He held Kat in his arms. \"You\u0027re incredible,\" he said. She lifted herself up on her elbows and looked down at him. \"So are you, darling. I\u0027m so happy.\" Mallory grinned. \"So am I.\" Ten thousand dollars\u0027 worth! he thought. And great sex. \"Promise me it will always be like this, Ken.\" \"I promise,\" Mallory said in his sincerest voice. Kat looked at her watch. \"I\u0027d better get dressed.\" \"Can\u0027t you spend the night here?\" \"No, I\u0027m riding to the hospital with Paige in the morning.\" She gave him a warm kiss. \"Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll have all our lives to spend together.\" He watched her get dressed. \"I can\u0027t wait to collect on that bet. It will buy us a great honeymoon.\" He frowned. \"But what if the boys don\u0027t believe me? They aren\u0027t going to take my word fork.\" Kat was thoughtful for a moment. Finally, she said, \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll let them know.\" Mallory grinned. \"Come on back to bed.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-24.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
