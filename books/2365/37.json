{"id":68926,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"The headline in the San Francisco Chronicle read, DOCTOR ARRESTED IN LOVE TRIANGLE MURDER. The story beneath it went on at length to detail the lurid facts of the case. Mallory read the newspaper in his cell. He slammed it down. His cellmate said, \"Looks like they got you cold, pal.\" \"Don\u0027t you believe it,\" Mallory said confidently. \"I\u0027ve got connections, and they\u0027re going to get me the best goddam lawyer in the world. I\u0027ll be out of here in twenty-four hours. All I have to do is make one phone call.\" The Harrisons were reading the newspaper at breakfast. \"My God!\" Lauren said. \"Ken! I can\u0027t believe it!\" A butler approached the breakfast table. \"Excuse me, Miss Harrison. Dr. Mallory is on the telephone for you. I believe he\u0027s calling from jail.\" \"I\u0027ll take it.\" Lauren started to get up from the table. \"You\u0027ll stay here and finish your breakfast,\" Alex Harrison said firmly. He turned to the butler. \"We don\u0027t know any Dr. Mallory.\" Paige read the newspaper as she was getting dressed. Mallory was going to be punished for the terrible thing he had done, but it gave Paige no satisfaction. Nothing they did to him could ever bring Kat back. The doorbell rang, and Paige went to open it. A stranger stood there. He was wearing a dark suit and carried a briefcase. \"Dr. Taylor?\" \"Yes ...\" \"My name is Roderick Pelham. I\u0027m an attorney with Rothman \u0026 Rothman. May I come in?\" Paige studied him, puzzled. \"Yes.\" He entered the apartment. \"What did you want to see me about?\" She watched him open the briefcase and take out some papers. \"You are aware, of course, that you are the principal beneficiary of John Cronin\u0027s will?\" Paige looked at him blankly. \"What are you talking about? There must be some mistake.\" \"Oh, there\u0027s no mistake. Mr. Cronin has left you the sum of one million dollars.\" Paige sank into a chair, overwhelmed, remembering. You have to go to Europe. Do me a favor. Go to Paris ... stay at the Crillon, have dinner at Maxim\u0027s, order a big, thick steak and a bottle of champagne, and when you eat that steak and drink that champagne, I want you to think of me. \"If you\u0027ll just sign here, we\u0027ll take care of all the necessary paperwork.\" Paige looked up. \"I ... I don\u0027t know what to say. I ... he had a family.\" \"According to the terms of his will, they get only the remainder of his estate, not a large amount.\" \"I can\u0027t accept this,\" Paige told him. Pelham looked at her in surprise. \"Why not?\" She had no answer. John Cronin had wanted her to have this money. \"I don\u0027t know. It...it seems unethical, somehow. He was my patient.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll leave the check here with you. You can decide what you want to do with it. Just sign here.\" Paige signed the paper in a daze. \"Goodbye, doctor.\" She watched him leave and sat there thinking of John Cronin. The news of Paige\u0027s inheritance was the talk of the hospital. Somehow, Paige had hoped it could be kept quiet. She still had not made up her mind about what to do with the money. It doesn\u0027t belong to me, Paige thought. He has a family. Paige was not emotionally ready to go back to work, but her patients had to be taken care of. An operation was scheduled for that morning. Arthur Kane was waiting for Paige in the corridor. They had not spoken to each other since the incident of the reversed X-rays. Although Paige had no proof it was Kane, the tire-slashing episode had scared her. \"Hello, Paige. Let\u0027s let bygones be bygones. What do you say?\" Paige shrugged. \"Fine.\" \"Wasn\u0027t that a terrible thing about Ken Mallory?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" Paige said. Kane was looking at her slyly. \"Can you imagine a doctor deliberately killing a human being? It\u0027s horrible, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes.\" \"By the way,\" he said, \"congratulations. I hear that you\u0027re a millionairess.\" \"I can\u0027t see ... \" \"I have tickets for the theater tonight, Paige. I thought that the two of us could go.\" \"Thanks,\" Paige said. \"I\u0027m engaged to someone.\" \"Then I suggest you get unengaged.\" She looked at him, surprised. \"I beg your pardon?\" Kane moved closer to her. \"I ordered an autopsy on John Cronin.\" Paige found her heart beginning to beat faster. \"Yes?\" \"He didn\u0027t die of heart failure. Someone gave him an overdose of insulin. I guess that particular someone never figured on an autopsy.\" Paige\u0027s mouth was suddenly dry. \"You were with him when he died, weren\u0027t you?\" She hesitated. \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m the only one who knows that, and I\u0027m the only one who has the report.\" He patted her arm. \"And my lips are sealed. Now, about those tickets tonight ...\" Paige pulled away from him. \"No!\" \"Are you sure you know what you\u0027re doing?\" She took a deep breath. \"Yes. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me ...\" And she walked away. Kane looked after her, and his face hardened. He turned and headed toward Dr. Benjamin Wallace\u0027s office. The telephone awakened her at 1:00 A.M. at her apartment. \"You have been a naughty girl again.\" It was the same raspy voice disguised in a breathy whisper, but this time Paige recognized it. My God, she thought, I was right to be scared. The following morning, when Paige arrived at the hospital, two men were waiting for her. \"Dr. Paige Taylor?\" \"Yes.\" \"You\u0027ll have to come with us. You\u0027re under arrest for the murder of John Cronin.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-37.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
