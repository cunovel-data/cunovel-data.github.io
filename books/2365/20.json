She genuinely cared about them. She worked in geriatrics, in pediatrics, and in various other wards, and Dr. Wallace saw to it that she was given assignments that kept her out of harm\u0027s way. He wanted to make sure that she stayed at the hospital and was available to him.\n Honey envied the nurses. They were able to nurture their patients without worrying about major medical decisions. I never wanted to be a doctor, Honey thought. I always wanted to be a nurse. There are no nurses in the Taft family.\n In the afternoons when Honey left the hospital, she would go shopping at the Bay Company, and Streetlight Records, and buy gifts for the children in pediatric care.\n \"I love children,\" she told Kat.\n \"Are you planning to have a large family?\" \"Someday,\" Honey said wistfully. \"I have to find their father first.\"\n One of Honey\u0027s favorite patients in the geriatric ward was Daniel McGuire, a cheerful man in his nineties who was suffering from a diseased liver condition. He had been a gambler in his youth, and he liked to make bets with Honey.\n \"I\u0027ll bet you fifty cents the orderly is late with my breakfast.\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet you a dollar it\u0027s going to rain this afternoon.\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet you the Giants win.\"\n Honey always took his bets.\n \"I\u0027ll bet you ten to one I beat this thing,\" he said.\n \"This time I\u0027m not going to bet you,\" Honey told him. \"I\u0027m on your side.\"\n He took her hand. \"I know you are.\" He grinned. \"If I were a few months younger ...\"\n Honey laughed. \"Never mind. I like older men.\"\n One morning a letter came to him addressed to the hospital. Honey took it to him in his room.\n \"Read it to me, would you?\" His eyesight had faded.\n \"Of course,\" Honey said. She opened the envelope, looked at it a moment, and let out a cry. \"You\u0027ve won the lottery! Fifty thousand dollars! Congratulations!\"\n \"How about that?\" He yelled. \"I always knew I\u0027d win the lottery one day! Give me a hug.\"\n Honey leaned down and hugged him.\n \"You know something, Honey? I\u0027m the luckiest man in the world.\"\n When Honey came back to visit him that afternoon, he had passed away.\n Honey was in the doctors\u0027 lounge when Dr. Stevens\n walked in. \"Is there a Virgo here?\" One of the doctors laughed. \"If you mean a virgin, I doubt it.\"\n \"A Virgo,\" Stevens repeated. \"I need a Virgo.\" \"I\u0027m a Virgo,\" Honey said. \"What\u0027s the problem?\" He walked up to her. \"The problem is that I have a goddam maniac on my hands. She won\u0027t let anyone near her but a Virgo.\" Honey got up. \"I\u0027ll go see her\". \"Thanks. Her name is Frances Gordon.\"\n Frances Gordon had just had a hip replacement. The moment Honey walked into the room, the woman looked up and said, \"You\u0027re a Virgo. Born on the cusp, right?\"\n Honey smiled. \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Those Aquarians and Leos don\u0027t know what the hell they\u0027re doin\u0027. They treat patients like they\u0027re meat.\"\n \"The doctors here are very good,\" Honey protested. \"They - \"\n \"Ha! Most of them are in it for the money.\" She looked at Honey more closely. \"You\u0027re different.\"\n Honey scanned the chart at the foot of the bed, a surprised look on her face.\n \"What\u0027s the matter? What are you lookin\u0027 at?\"\n \"Has he beaten you up before?\"\n \"Yes, but he ... he doesn\u0027t mean anything by it. He gets drunk and loses his temper.\"\n \"Why haven\u0027t you left him?\"\n Mrs. Owens shrugged, and the movement caused her pain. \"The kids and I have nowhere to go.\"\n Honey was listening, furious. \"You don\u0027t have to take this, you know. There are shelters and agencies that will take care of you and protect you and the children.\"\n The woman shook her head in despair. \"I have no money. I lost my job as a secretary when he started ...\" She could not go on.\n Honey squeezed her hand. \"You\u0027re going to be fine. I\u0027ll see that you\u0027re taken care of.\"\n Five minutes later Honey marched into Dr. Wallace\u0027s office. He was delighted to see her. He wondered what she had brought with her this time. At various times, she had used warm honey, hot water, melted chocolate, and - his favorite - maple syrup. Her ingenuity was boundless.\n \"Lock the door, baby.\"\n \"I can\u0027t stay, Ben. I have to get back.\"\n She told him about her patient.\n \"You\u0027ll have to file a police report,\" Wallace said. \"It\u0027s the law.\"\n \"The law hasn\u0027t protected her before. Look, all she wants to do is get away from her husband. She worked as a secretary. Didn\u0027t you say you needed a new file clerk?\"\n \"Well, yes, but ... wait a minute!\"\n \"Thanks,\" Honey said. \"We\u0027ll get her on her feet, and find her a place to live, and she\u0027ll have a new job!\"\n Wallace sighed. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" \"I knew you would,\" Honey said.\n The next morning, Honey went back to see Mrs. Owens.\n \"How are you feeling today?\" Honey asked.\n \"Better, thanks. When can I go home? My husband doesn\u0027t like it when - \"\n \"Your husband is\u0027not going to bother you anymore,\" Honey said firmly. \"You\u0027ll stay here until we find a place for you and the children to live, and when you\u0027re well enough, you\u0027re going to have a job here at the hospital.\"\n Mrs. Owens stared at her unbelievingly. \"Do ... do you mean that?\"\n \"Absolutely. You\u0027ll have your own apartment with your children. You won\u0027t have to put up with the kind of horror you\u0027ve been living through, and you\u0027ll have a decent, respectable job.\"\n Mrs. Owens clutched Honey\u0027s hand. \"I don\u0027t know how to thank you,\" she sobbed. \"You don\u0027t know what it has been like.\"\n \"I can imagine,\" Honey said. \"You\u0027re going to be fine.\"\n The woman nodded, too choked up to speak.\n The following day when Honey returned to see Mrs. Owens, the room was empty.\n \"Where is she?\" Honey asked.\n \"Oh,\" the nurse said, \"she left this morning with her husband.\"\n Her name was on the PA system again. \"Dr. Taft ... Room 215. ... Dr. Taft ... Room 215.\"\n In the corridor Honey ran into Kat. \"How\u0027s your day going?\" Kat asked.\n \"You wouldn\u0027t believe it!\" Honey told her.\n Dr. Ritter was waiting for her in Room 215. In bed was an Indian man in his late twenties.\n Dr. Ritter said, \"This is your patient?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"It says here that he speaks no English. Right?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n He showed her the chart. \"And this is your writing? Vomiting, cramps, thirst, dehydration ...\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Honey said.\n \"... absence of peripheral pulse ...\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And what was your diagnosis?\"\n \"Stomach flu.\"\n \"Did you take a stool sample?\"\n \"No. What for?\"\n \"Because your patient has cholera, that\u0027s what for!\" He was screaming. \"We\u0027re going to have to close down the fucking hospital!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-20.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: \n Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
