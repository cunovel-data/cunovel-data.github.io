{"id":68872,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Across town, in another part of the city, reporters and TV crews were waiting in the street for Lou Dinetto as he left the courtroom, smiling and waving, the greeting of royalty to the peasants. There were two bodyguards at his side, a tall, thin man known as the Shadow, and a heavy set man called Rhino. Lou Dinetto was, as always, dressed elegantly and expensively, in a gray silk suit with a white shirt, blue tie, and alligator shoes. His clothes had to be carefully tailored to make him look trim, because he was short and stout, with bandy legs. He always had a smile and a ready quip for the press, and they enjoyed quoting him. Dinetto had been indicted and tried three times on charges ranging from arson to racketeering to murder, and each time had gone free. Now as he left the courtroom, one of the reporters yelled out, \"Did you know you were going to be acquitted, Mr. Dinetto?\" Dinetto laughed. \"Of course I did. I\u0027m an innocent businessman. The government has got nothing better to do than to persecute me. That\u0027s one of the reasons our taxes are so high.\" A TV camera was aimed at him. Lou Dinetto stopped to smile into it. \"Mr. Dinetto, can you explain why two witnesses who were scheduled to testify against you in your murder trial failed to appear?\" \"Certainly I can explain it,\" Dinetto said. \"They were honest citizens who decided not to perjure themselves.\" \"The government claims that you\u0027re the head of the West Coast mob, and that it was you who arranged for - \" \"The only thing I arrange for is where people sit at my restaurant. I want everybody to be comfortable.\" He grinned at the milling crowd of reporters. \"By the way, you\u0027re all invited to the restaurant tonight for a free dinner and drinks.\" He was moving toward the curb, where a black stretch limousine was waiting for him. \"Mr. Dinetto ...\" \"Mr. Dinetto ...\" \"Mr. Dinetto ...\" \"I\u0027ll see you at my restaurant tonight, boys and girls. You all know where it is.\" And Lou Dinetto was in the car, waving and smiling. Rhino closed the door of the limousine and got into the front seat. The Shadow slipped behind the wheel. \"That was great, boss!\" Rhino said. \"You sure know how to handle them bums.\" \"Where to?\" the Shadow asked. \"Home. I can use a hot bath and a good steak.\" The car started off. \"I don\u0027t like that question about the witnesses,\" Dinetto said. \"You sure they\u0027ll never ...?\" \"Not unless they can talk underwater, boss.\" Dinetto nodded. \"Good.\" The car was speeding along Fillmore Street. Dinetto said, \"Did you see the look on the DA\u0027s face when the judge dismissed ...?\" A small dog appeared out of nowhere, directly in front of the limousine. The Shadow swung the wheel hard to avoid hitting it and jammed on the brakes. The car jumped the curb and crashed into a lamppost. Rhino\u0027s head flew forward into the windshield. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" Dinetto screamed. \"You trying to kill me?\" The Shadow was trembling. \"Sorry, boss. A dog ran in front of the car ...\" \"And you decided his life was more important than mine? You stupid asshole!\" Rhino was moaning. He turned around, and Dinetto saw blood pouring from a large cut in his forehead. \"For Christ\u0027s sake!\" Dinetto screamed. \"Look what you\u0027ve done!\" \"I\u0027m all right,\" Rhino mumbled. \"The hell you are!\" Dinetto turned to the Shadow. \"Get him to a hospital.\" The Shadow backed the limousine off the curb. \"The Embarcadero is only a couple of blocks down. We\u0027ll take him to the emergency ward there.\" \"Right, boss.\" Dinetto sank back in his seat. \"A dog,\" he said disgustedly. \"Jesus!\" Kat was in the emergency ward when Dinetto, the Shadow, and Rhino walked in. Rhino was bleeding heavily. Dinetto called out to Kat, \"Hey, you!\" Kat looked up. \"Are you talking to me?\" \"Who the hell do you think I\u0027m talking to? This man is bleeding. Get him fixed up right away.\" \"There are half a dozen others ahead of him,\" Kat said quietly. \"He\u0027ll have to wait his turn.\" \"He\u0027s not waiting for anything,\" Dinetto told her. \"You\u0027ll take care of him now.\" Kat stepped over to Rhino and examined him. She took a piece of cotton and pressed it against the cut. \"Hold it there. I\u0027ll be back.\" \"I said to take care of him now,\" Dinetto snapped. Kat turned to Dinetto. \"This is an emergency hospital ward. I\u0027m the doctor in charge. So either keep quiet or get out.\" The Shadow said, \"Lady, you don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talking to. You better do what the man says. This is Mr. Lou Dinetto.\" \"Now that the introductions are over,\" Dinetto said impatiently, \"take care of my man.\" \"You have a hearing problem,\" Kat said. \"I\u0027ll tell vou once more. Keep quiet or get out of here. I have work to do.\" Rhino said, \"You can\u0027t talk to - \" Dinetto turned to him. \"Shut up!\" He looked at again, and his tone changed. \"I would appreciate it if you could get to him as soon as possible.\" \"I\u0027ll do my best.\" Kat sat Rhino down on a cot. \"Lie down. I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes.\" She looked at Dinetto. \"There are some chairs over there in the corner.\" Dinetto and the Shadow watched her walk to the other end of the ward to take care of the waiting patients. \"Jesus,\" the Shadow said. \"She has no idea who you are.\" \"I don\u0027t think it would make any difference. She\u0027s got balls.\" Fifteen minutes later, Kat returned to Rhino and examined him. \"No concussion,\" she announced. \"You\u0027re lucky. That\u0027s a nasty cut.\" Dinetto stood watching as Kat skillfully put stitches in Rhino\u0027s forehead. When Kat was finished, she said, \"That should heal nicely. Come back in five days, and I\u0027ll take out the stitches.\" Dinetto walked over and examined Rhino\u0027s forehead. \"That\u0027s a damn good job.\" \"Thanks,\" Kat said. \"Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me ...\" \"Wait a minute,\" Dinetto called. He turned to the Shadow. \"Give her a C-note.\" The Shadow took a hundred-dollar bill out of his pocket. \"Here.\" \"The cashier\u0027s office is outside.\" \"This isn\u0027t for the hospital. It\u0027s for you.\" \"No, thanks.\" Dinetto stared as Kat walked away and began working on another patient. The Shadow said, \"Maybe it wasn\u0027t enough, boss.\" Dinetto shook his head. \"She\u0027s an independent broad. I like that.\" He was silent for a moment. \"Doc Evans is retiring, right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Okay. I want you to find out everything you can about this doctor.\" \"What for?\" \"Leverage. I think she might come in very handy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-7.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
