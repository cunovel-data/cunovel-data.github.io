{"id":68869,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"That afternoon, when the rounds were finished, the new residents gathered in the small upstairs lounge. The room held eight tables, an ancient black-and-white television set, and two vending machines that dispensed stale sandwiches and bitter coffee.\n The conversations at each table were almost identical.\n One of the residents said, \"Take a look at my throat, will you? Does it look raw to you?\"\n \"I think I have a fever. I feel lousy.\"\n \"My abdomen is swollen and tender. I know I have appendicitis.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got this crushing pain in my chest. I hope to God I\u0027m not having a heart attack!\"\n Kat sat down at a table with Paige and Honey. \"How did it go?\" she asked.\n Honey said, \"I think it went all right.\"\n They both looked at Paige. \"I was tense, but I was relaxed. I was nervous, but I stayed calm.\" She sighed. \"It\u0027s been a long day. I\u0027ll be glad to get out of here and have some fun tonight.\"\n \"Me, too,\" Kat agreed. \"Why don\u0027t we have dinner and then go see a movie?\"\n \"Sounds great.\"\n An orderly approached their table. \"Dr. Taylor?\"\n Paige looked up. \"I\u0027m Dr. Taylor.\"\n \"Dr. Wallace would like to see you in his office.\"\n The hospital administrator! What have I done? Paige wondered.\n The orderly was waiting. \"Dr. Taylor ...\"\n \"I\u0027m coming.\" She took a deep breath and got to her feet. \"I\u0027ll see you later.\"\n \"This way, doctor.\"\n Paige followed the orderly into an elevator and rode up to the fifth floor, where Dr. Wallace\u0027s office was located.\n Benjamin Wallace was seated behind his desk. He glanced up as Paige walked in. \"Good afternoon, Dr. Taylor.\"\n \"Good afternoon.\"\n Wallace cleared his throat. \"Well! Your first day and you\u0027ve already made quite an impression!\"\n Paige looked at him, puzzled. \"I ...I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"I hear you had a little problem in the doctors\u0027 dressing room this morning.\"\n \"Oh.\" So, that\u0027s what this is all about. Wallace looked at her and smiled. \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to make some arrangements for you and the other girls.\"\n \"We\u0027re ...\" We\u0027re not girls, Paige started to say. \"We would appreciate that.\"\n \"Meanwhile, if you don\u0027t want to dress with the nurses ...\"\n \"I\u0027m not a nurse,\" Paige said firmly. \"I\u0027m a doctor.\"\n \"Of course, of course. Well, we\u0027ll do something about accommodations for you, doctor.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n He handed Paige a sheet of paper. \"Meanwhile, this is your schedule. You\u0027ll be on call for the next twenty-four hours, starting at six o\u0027clock.\" He looked at his watch. \"That\u0027s thirty minutes from now.\"\n Paige was looking at him in astonishment. Her day had started at five-thirty that morning. \"Twenty-four hours?\"\n \"Well, thirty-six, actually. Because you\u0027ll be starting rounds again in the morning.\"\n Thirty-six hours! I wonder if I can handle this.\n She was soon to find out.\n Paige went to look for Kat and Honey.\n \"I\u0027m going to have to forget about dinner and a movie,\" Paige said. \"I\u0027m on a thirty-six-hour call.\"\n Kat nodded. \"We just got our bad news. I go on it tomorrow, and Honey goes on Wednesday.\"\n \"It won\u0027t be so bad,\" Paige said cheerfully. \"I understand there\u0027s an on-call room to sleep in. I\u0027m going to enjoy this.\"\n She was wrong.\n An orderly was leading Paige down a long corridor. \"Dr. Wallace told me that I\u0027ll be on call for thirty-six hours,\" Paige said. \"Do all the residents work those hours?\"\n \"Only for the first three years,\" the orderly assured her.\n Great!\n \"But you\u0027ll have plenty of chance to rest, doctor.\"\n \"I will?\"\n \"In here. This is the on-call room.\" He opened the door, and Paige stepped inside. The room resembled a monk\u0027s cell in some poverty-stricken monastery. It contained nothing but a cot with a lumpy mattress, a cracked wash basin, and a bedside stand with a telephone on it. \"You can sleep here between calls.\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n The calls began as Paige was in the coffee shop, just starting to have her dinner. \"Dr. Taylor ... ER Three. ... Dr. Taylor ... ER Three.\"\n \"We have a patient with a fractured rib... .\" \"Mr. Henegan is complaining of chest pains. ...\" \"The patient in Ward Two has a headache. Is it all right to give him an acetaminophen ...?\" At midnight, Paige had just managed to fall asleep\n when she was awakened by the telephone. \"Report to ER One.\" It was a knife wound, and by the time Paige had taken care of it, it was one-thirty in the morning. At two-fifteen she was awakened again. \"Dr. Taylor ... Emergency Room Two. Stat.\" Paige said, groggily, \"Right.\" What did he say it meant? Shake that ass, tootsie. She forced herself up and moved down the corridor to the emergency room.\n A patient had been brought in with a broken leg. He was screaming with pain.\n \"Get an X-ray,\" Paige ordered. \"And give him Demerol, fifty milligrams.\" She put her hand on the patient\u0027s arm. \"You\u0027re going to be fine. Try to relax.\"\n Over the PA system, a metallic disembodied voice said, \"Dr. Taylor ... Ward Three. Stat.\"\n Paige looked at the moaning patient, reluctant to leave him.\n The voice came on again, \"Dr. Taylor ... Ward Three. Stat.\"\n \"Coming,\" Paige mumbled. She hurried out the door and down the corridor to Ward Three. A patient had vomited, aspirated, and was choking.\n \"He can\u0027t breathe,\" the nurse said.\n \"Suction him,\" Paige ordered. As she watched the patient begin to catch his breath, she heard her name again on the PA system. \"Dr. Taylor ... Ward Four. Ward Four.\" Paige shook her head and ran down to Ward Four, to a screaming patient with abdominal spasms. Paige gave him a quick examination. \"It could be intestinal dysfunction. Get an ultrasound,\" Paige said.\n By the time she returned to the patient with the broken leg, the pain reliever had taken effect. She had him moved to the operating room and set the leg. As she was finishing, she heard her name again. \"Dr. Taylor, report to Emergency Room Two. Stat.\"\n \"The stomach ulcer in Ward Four is having a pain. ...\"\n At 3:30 A.M.: \"Dr. Taylor, the patient in Room 310 is hemorrhaging. ...\"\n There was a heart attack in one of the wards, and Paige was nervously listening to the patient\u0027s heartbeat when she heard her name called over the PA system: \"Dr. Taylor ... ER Two. Stat. ... Dr. Taylor ... ER Two. Stat.\"\n I must not panic, Paige thought. I\u0027ve got to remain calm and cool. She panicked. Who was more important, the patient she was examining, or the next patient? \"You stay here,\" she said inanely. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\n As Paige hurried toward ER Two, she heard her name called again. \"Dr. Taylor ... ER One. Stat. ... Dr. Taylor ... ER One. Stat.\"\n Oh, my Godl Paige thought. She felt as though she were caught up in the middle of some endless terrifying nightmare.\n During what was left of the night, Paige was awakened to attend to a case of food poisoning, a broken arm, a hiatal hernia, and a fractured rib. By the time she stumbled back into the on-call room, she was so exhausted that she could hardly move. She crawled onto the little cot and had just started to doze off when the telephone rang again.\n She reached out for it with her eyes closed. \"H\u0027lo ...\"\n \"Dr. Taylor, we\u0027re waiting for you.\"\n \"Wha\u0027?\" She lay there, trying to remember where she was.\n \"Your rounds are starting, doctor.\"\n \"My rounds?\" This is some kind of bad joke, Paige thought. It\u0027s inhuman. They can\u0027t work anyone like thisl But they were waiting for her.\n Ten minutes later, Paige was making the rounds again, half asleep. She stumbled against Dr. Radnor. \"Excuse me,\" she mumbled, \"but I haven\u0027t had any sleep ...\"\n He patted her on the shoulder sympathetically. \"You\u0027ll get used to it.\"\n When Paige finally got off duty, she slept for fourteen straight hours.\n The intense pressure and punishing hours proved to be too much for some of the residents, and they simply disappeared from the hospital. That\u0027s not going to happen to me, Paige vowed.\n The pressure was unrelenting. At the end of one of Paige\u0027s shifts, thirty-six grueling hours, she was so exhausted that she had no idea where she was. She stumbled to the elevator and stood there, her mind numb.\n Tom Chang came up to her. \"Are you all right?\"\n \"Fine,\" Paige mumbled.\n He grinned. \"You look like hell.\"\n \"Thanks. Why do they do this to us?\" Paige asked.\n Chang shrugged. \"The theory is that it keeps us in touch with our patients. If we go home and leave them, we don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening to them while we\u0027re gone.\"\n Paige nodded. \"That makes sense.\" It made no sense at all. \"How can we take care of them if we\u0027re asleep on our feet?\"\n Chang shrugged again. \"I don\u0027t make the rules. It\u0027s the way all hospitals operate.\" He looked at Paige more closely. \"Are you going to be able to make it home?\"\n Paige looked at him and said haughtily, \"Of course.\"\n \"Take care.\" Chang disappeared down the corridor. Paige waited for the elevator to arrive. When it finally came, she was standing there, sound asleep.\n Two days later, Paige was having breakfast with Kat.\n \"Do you want to hear a terrible confession?\" Paige asked. \"Sometimes when they wake me up at four o\u0027clock in the morning to give somebody an aspirin, and I\u0027m stumbling down the hall, half conscious, and I pass the rooms where all the patients are tucked in and having a good night\u0027s sleep, I feel like banging on all the doors and yelling, \u0027Everybody wake up!\u0027 \"\n Kat held out her hand. \"Join the club.\"\n The patients came in all shapes, sizes, ages, and colors. They were frightened, brave, gentle, arrogant, demanding, considerate. They were human beings in pain.\n Most of the doctors were dedicated people. As in any profession, there were good doctors and bad doctors. They were young and old, clumsy and adept, pleasant and nasty. A few of them, at one time or another, made sexual advances to Paige. Some were subtle and some were crude.\n \"Don\u0027t you ever feel lonely at night? I know that I do. I was wondering ...\"\n \"These hours are murder, aren\u0027t they? Do you know what I find gives me energy? Good sex. Why don\u0027t we ...?\"\n \"My wife is out of town for a few days. I have a cabin near Carmel. This weekend we could ...\"\n And the patients.\n \"So you\u0027re my doctor, eh? You know what would cure me ...?\"\n \"Come closer to the bed, baby. I want to see if those are real. ...\"\n Paige gritted her teeth and ignored them all. When Alfred and I are married, this will stop. And just the thought of Alfred gave her a glow. He would be returning from Africa soon. Soon.\n At breakfast one morning before rounds, Paige and Kat talked about the sexual harassment they were experiencing.\n \"Most of the doctors behave like perfect gentlemen, but a few of them seem to think we\u0027re perks that go with the territory, and that we\u0027re there to service them,\" Kat said. \"I don\u0027t think a week goes by but what one of the doctors hits on me. \u0027Why don\u0027t you come over to my place for a drink? I\u0027ve got some great CDs.\u0027 Or in the OR, when I\u0027m assisting, the surgeon will brush his arm across my breast. One moron said to me, \u0027You know, whenever I order chicken, I like the dark meat.\"\n Paige sighed. \"They think they\u0027re flattering us by treating us as sex objects. I\u0027d rather they treated us as doctors.\"\n \"A lot of them don\u0027t even want us around. They either want to fuck us or they want to fuck us. You know, it\u0027s not fair. Women are judged inferior until we prove ourselves, and men are judged superior until they prove what assholes they are.\"\n \"It\u0027s the old boys\u0027 network,\" Paige said. \"If there were more of us, we could start a new girls\u0027 network.\"\n Paige had heard of Arthur Kane. He was the subject of constant gossip around the hospital. His nickname was Dr. 007 - licensed to kill. His solution to every problem was to operate, and he had a higher rate of operations than any other doctor at the hospital. He also had a higher mortality rate.\n He was bald, short, hawk-nosed, with tobacco-stained teeth, and was grossly overweight. Incredibly, he fancied himself a ladies\u0027 man. He liked to refer to the new nurses and female residents as \"fresh meat.\"\n Paige Taylor was fresh meat. He saw her in the upstairs lounge and sat down at her table, uninvited.\n \"I\u0027ve been keeping an eye on you.\"\n Paige looked up, startled. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"I\u0027m Dr. Kane. My friends call me Arthur.\" There was a leer in his voice.\n Paige wondered how many friends he had.\n \"How are you getting along here?\"\n The question caught Paige off-guard. \"I...all right, I think.\"\n He leaned forward. \"This is a big hospital. It\u0027s easy to get lost here. Do you know what I mean?\"\n Paige said warily, \"Not exactly.\"\n \"You\u0027re too pretty to be just another face in the crowd. If you want to get somewhere here, you need someone to help you. Someone who knows the ropes.\"\n The conversation was getting more unpleasant by the minute.\n \"And you\u0027d like to help me.\"\n \"Right.\" He bared his tobacco-stained teeth. \"Why don\u0027t we discuss it at dinner?\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing to discuss,\" Paige said. \"I\u0027m not interested.\"\n Arthur Kane watched Paige get up and walk away, and there was a baleful expression on his face.\n First-year surgical residents were on a two-month rotation schedule, alternating among obstetrics, orthopedics, urology, and surgery.\n Paige learned that it was dangerous to go into a training hospital in the summer for any serious illness, because many of the staff doctors were on vacation and the patients were at the mercy of the inexperienced young residents.\n Nearly all surgeons liked to have music in the operating room. One of the doctors was nicknamed Mozart and another Axl Rose because of their tastes in music.\n For some reason, operations always seemed to make everyone hungry. They constantly discussed food. A surgeon would be in the middle of removing a gangrenous gall bladder from a patient and say, \"I had a great dinner last night at Bardelli\u0027s. Best Italian food in all of San Francisco.\"\n \"Have you eaten the crab cakes at the Cypress Club ...?\"\n \"If you like good beef, try the House of Prime Rib over on Van Ness.\"\n And meanwhile, a nurse would be mopping up the patient\u0027s blood and guts.\n When they weren\u0027t talking about food, the doctors talked about baseball or football scores.\n \"Did you see the 49ers play last Sunday? I bet they miss Joe Montana. He always came through for them in the last two minutes of a game.\"\n And out would come a ruptured appendix.\n Kafka, Paige thought. Kafka would have loved this.\n At three in the morning, when Paige was asleep in the on-call room, she was awakened by the telephone.\n A raspy voice said, \"Dr. Taylor - Room 419 - a heart attack patient. You\u0027ll have to hurry!\" The line went dead.\n Paige sat on the edge of the bed, fighting sleep, and stumbled to her feet. You have to hurry. She went into the corridor, but there was no time to wait for an elevator. She rushed up the stairs and ran down the fourth-floor corridor to Room 419, her heart pounding. She flung open the door and stood there, staring.\n Room 419 was a storage room.\n Kat Hunter was making her rounds with Dr. Richard Hutton. He was in his forties, brusque and fast. He spent no more than two or three minutes with each patient, scanning their charts, then snapping out orders to the surgical residents in a machine-gun, staccato fashion.\n \"Check her hemoglobin and schedule surgery for tomorrow. ...\"\n \"Keep a close eye on his temperature chart. ...\"\n \"Cross-match four units of blood. ...\"\n \"Remove these stitches. ...\"\n \"Get some chest films. ...\"\n Kat and the other residents were busily making notes on everything, trying hard to keep up with him.\n They approached a patient who had been in the hospital a week and had had a battery of tests for a high fever, with no results.\n When they were out in the corridor, Kat asked, \"What\u0027s the matter with him?\"\n \"It\u0027s a GOK,\" a resident said. \"A God only knows. We\u0027ve done X-rays, CAT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, liver biopsy. Everything. We don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with him.\"\n They moved into a ward where a young patient, his head bandaged after an operation, was sleeping. As Dr. Hutton started to unwrap the head dressing, the patient woke up, startled. \"What ... what\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Sit up,\" Dr. Hutton said curtly. The young man was trembling.\n I\u0027ll never treat my patients that way, Kat vowed.\n The next patient was a healthy-looking man in his seventies. As soon as Dr. Hutton approached the bed, the patient yelled, \"Gonzo! I\u0027m going to sue you, you dirty son of a bitch.\"\n \"Now, Mr. Sparolini ...\"\n \"Don\u0027t Mr. Sparolini me! You turned me into a fucking eunuch.\"\n That\u0027s an oxymoron, Kat thought.\n \"Mr. Sparolini, you agreed to have the vasectomy; and - \"\n \"It was my wife\u0027s idea. Damn bitch! Just wait till I get home.\"\n They left him muttering to himself.\n \"What\u0027s his problem?\" one of the residents asked.\n \"His problem is that he\u0027s a horny old goat. His young wife has six kids and she doesn\u0027t want any more.\"\n The next patient was a little girl, ten years old. Dr. Hutton looked at her chart. \"We\u0027re going to give you a shot to make the bad bugs go away.\"\n A nurse filled a syringe and moved toward the little girl.\n \"No!\" she screamed. \"You\u0027re going to hurt me!\"\n \"This won\u0027t hurt, baby,\" the nurse assured her.\n The words were a dark echo in Kat\u0027s mind.\n This won\u0027t hurt, baby. ... It was the voice of her stepfather whispering to her in the scary dark.\n \"This will feel good. Spread your legs. Come on, you little bitch!\" And he had pushed her legs apart and forced his male hardness into her and put his hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming with the pain. She was thirteen years old. After that night, his visits became a terrifying nightly ritual. \"You\u0027re lucky you got a man like me to teach you how to fuck,\" he would tell her. \"Do you know what a Kat is? A little pussy. And I want some.\" And he would fall on top of her and grab her, and no amount of crying or pleading would make him stop.\n Kat had never known her father. Her mother was a cleaning woman who worked nights at an office building near their tiny apartment in Gary, Indiana. Kat\u0027s stepfather was a huge man who had been injured in an accident at a steel mill, and he stayed home most of the time, drinking. At night, when Kat\u0027s mother left for work, he would go into Kat\u0027s room. \"You say anything to your mother or brother, and I\u0027ll kill him,\" he told Kat. / can\u0027t let him hurt Mike, Kat thought. Her brother was five years younger than she, and Kat adored him. She mothered him and protected him and fought his battles for him. He was the only bright spot in Kat\u0027s life.\n One morning, terrified as Kat was by her stepfather\u0027s threats, she decided she had to tell her mother what was happening. Her mother would put a stop to it, would protect her.\n \"Mama, your husband comes to my bed at night when you\u0027re away, and forces himself on me.\"\n Her mother stared at her a moment, then slapped Kat hard across the face.\n \"Don\u0027t you dare make up lies like that, you little slut!\"\n Kat never discussed it again. The only reason she stayed at home was because of Mike. He\u0027d be lost without me, Kat thought. But the day she learned she was pregnant, she ran away to live with an aunt in Minneapolis.\n The day Kat ran away from home, her life completely changed.\n \"You don\u0027t have to tell me what happened,\" her Aunt Sophie had said. \"But from now on, you\u0027re going to stop running away. You know that song they sing on Sesame Street! \u0027It\u0027s Not Easy Being Green\u0027? Well, honey, it\u0027s not easy being black, either. You have two choices. You can keep running and hiding and blaming the world for your problems, or you can stand up for yourself and decide to be somebody important.\"\n \"How do I do that?\"\n \"By knowing that you\u0027re important. First, you get image in your mind of who you want to be, child, and what you want to be. And then you go to work, becoming that person.\"\n I\u0027m not going to have his baby, Kat decided. I want an abortion.\n It was arranged quietly, during a weekend, and it was performed by a midwife who was a friend of Kat\u0027s aunt. When it was over, Kat thought fiercely, I\u0027m never going to let a man touch me again. Never!\n Minneapolis was a fairyland for Kat. Within a few blocks of almost every home were lakes and streams and rivers. And there were over eight thousand acres of landscaped parks. She went sailing on the city lakes and took boat rides on the Mississippi.\n She visited the Great Zoo with Aunt Sophie and spent Sundays at the Valleyfair Amusement Park. She went on the hay rides at Cedar Creek Farm, and watched knights in armor jousting at the Shakopee Renaissance Festival.\n Aunt Sophie watched Kat and thought, The girl has never had a childhood.\n Kat was learning to enjoy herself, but Aunt Sophie sensed that deep inside her niece was a place that no one could reach, a barrier she had set up to keep her from being hurt again.\n She made friends at school. But never with boys. Her girlfriends were all dating, but Kat was a loner, and too proud to tell anyone why. She looked up to her aunt, whom she loved very much.\n Kat had taken little interest in school, or in reading books, but Aunt Sophie changed all that. Her home was filled with books, and Sophie\u0027s excitement about them was contagious.\n \"There are wonderful worlds in there,\" she told the young girl. \"Read, and you\u0027ll learn where you came from and where you\u0027re going. I\u0027ve got a feeling that you\u0027re going to be famous one day, baby. But you have to get an education first. This is America. You can become anybody you want to be. You may be black and poor, but so were some of our congresswomen, and movie stars, and scientists, and sports legends. One day we\u0027re going to have a black president. You can be anything you want to be. It\u0027s up to you.\"\n It was the beginning.\n Kat became the top student in her class. She was an avid reader. In the school library one day, she happened to pick up a copy of Sinclair Lewis\u0027s Arrowsmith, and she was fascinated by the story of the dedicated young doctor. She read Agnes Cooper\u0027s Promises to Keep, and Woman Surgeon by Dr. Else Roe, and it opened up a whole new world for Kat. She discovered that there were people on this earth who devoted themselves to helping others, to saving lives. When Kat came home from school one day, she said to Aunt Sophie, \"I\u0027m going to be a doctor. A famous one.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-4.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: \n Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
