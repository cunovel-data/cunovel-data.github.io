{"id":68878,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"By the beginning of her fourth year of residency, Paige had assisted in hundreds of operations. They had become second nature to her. She knew the surgery procedures for the gallbladder, spleen, liver, appendix, and, most exciting, the heart. But Paige was frustrated because she was not doing the operations herself. Whatever happened to \"Watch one, do one, teach one\"? she wondered. The answer came when George Englund, chief of surgery, sent for her. \"Paige, there\u0027s a hernia operation scheduled for tomorrow in OR Three, seven-thirty A.M.\" She made a note. \"Right. Who\u0027s doing the operation?\" \"You are.\" \"Right. I ...\" The words suddenly sank in. \"I am?\" \"Yes. Any problem with that?\" Paige\u0027s grin lit up the room. \"No, sir! I... thanks!\" \"You\u0027re ready for it. I think the patient\u0027s lucky to have you. His name is Walter Herzog. He\u0027s in 314.\" \"Herzog. Room 314. Right.\" And Paige was out the door. Paige had never been so excited. \"I\u0027m going to do my first operation! I\u0027m going to hold a human being\u0027s life in my hands. What if I\u0027m not ready\"? What if I make a mistakel Things can go wrong. It\u0027s Murphy\u0027s Law. By the time Paige was through arguing with herself, she was in a state of panic. She went into the cafeteria and sat down to have a cup of black coffee. It\u0027s going to be all right, she told herself. I\u0027ve assisted in dozens of hernia operations. There\u0027s nothing to it. He\u0027s lucky to have me. By the time she finished her coffee, she was calm enough to face her first patient. Walter Herzog was in his sixties, thin, bald, and very nervous. He was in bed, clutching his groin, when Paige walked in, carrying a bouquet of flowers. Herzog looked up. \"Nurse ... I want to see a doctor.\" Paige walked over to the bed and handed him the flowers. \"I\u0027m the doctor. I\u0027m going to operate on you.\" He looked at the flowers, and looked at her. \"You\u0027re what?\" \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Paige said reassuringly. \"You\u0027re in good hands.\" She picked up his chart at the foot of the bed and studied it. \"What does it say?\" the man asked anxiously. Why did she bring me flowers\u0027? \"It says you\u0027re going to be just fine.\" He swallowed. \"Are you really going to do the operation?\" \"Yes.\" \"You seem awfully ... awfully young.\" Paige patted his arm. \"I haven\u0027t lost a patient yet.\" She looked around the room. \"Are you comfortable? Can I get you anything to read? A book or magazine? Candy?\" He was listening, nervously. \"No, I\u0027m okay.\" Why was she being so nice to him? Was there something she wasn\u0027t telling him? \"Well, then, I\u0027ll see you in the morning,\" Paige said cheerfully. She wrote something on a piece of paper and handed it to him. \"Here\u0027s my home number. You call me if you need me tonight. I\u0027ll stay right by the phone.\" By the time Paige left, Walter Herzog was a nervous wreck. A few minutes later, jimmy found Paige in the lounge. He walked up to her with his wide grin. \"Congratulations! I hear you\u0027re going to do a procedure.\" Word gets around fast, Paige thought. \"Yes.\" \"Whoever he is, he\u0027s lucky,\" Jimmy said. \"If anything ever happened to me, you\u0027re the only one I\u0027d let operate on me.\" \"Thanks, Jimmy.\" And, of course, with Jimmy, there was always a joke. \"Did you hear the one about the man who had a strange pain in his ankles? He was too cheap to go to a doctor, so when his friend told him he had exactly the same pain\", he said, \"You\u0027d better get to a doctor right away. And tell me exactly what he says.\" \"The next day, he learns his friend is dead. He rushes to a hospital and has five thousand dollars\u0027 worth of tests. They can\u0027t find anything wrong. He calls his friend\u0027s widow, and says, \u0027Was Chester in a lot of pain before he died?\u0027\" \"No,\" she says. \"He didn\u0027t even see the truck that hit him!\" And Jimmy was gone. Paige was too excited to eat dinner. She spent the evening practicing tying surgical knots on table legs and lamps. I\u0027m going to get a good night\u0027s sleep, Paige decided, so I\u0027ll be nice and fresh in the morning. She was awake all night, going over the operation again and again in her mind. There are three types of hernias: reducible hernia, where it\u0027s possible to push the testicles back into the abdomen; irreducible hernia, where adhesions prevent returning the contents to the abdomen; and the most dangerous, strangulated hernia, where the blood flow through the hernia is shut off, damaging the intestines. Walter Herzog\u0027s was a reducible hernia. At six o\u0027clock in the morning, Paige drove to the hospital parking lot. A new red Ferrari was next to her parking space. Idly, Paige wondered who owned it. Whoever it was had to be rich. At seven o\u0027clock, Paige was helping Walter Herzog change from pajamas to a blue hospital gown. The nurse had already given him a sedative to relax him while they waited for the gurney that would take him to the operating room. \"This is my first operation,\" Walter Herzog said. Mine, too, Paige thought. The gurney arrived and Walter Herzog was on his way to OR Three. Paige walked down the corridor beside him, and her heart was pounding so loudly that she was afraid he could hear it. OR Three was one of the larger operating rooms, able to accommodate a heart monitor, a heart-lung machine, and an array of other technical paraphernalia. When Paige walked into the room, the staff were already there, preparing the equipment. There was an attending physician, the anesthesiologist, two residents, a scrub nurse, and two circulating nurses. The staff were watching her expectantly, eager to see how she would handle her first operation. Paige walked up to the operating table. Walter Herzog had had his groin shaved and scrubbed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes had been placed around the operating area. Herzog looked up at Paige and said drowsily, \"You\u0027re not going to let me die, are you?\" Paige smiled. \"What? And spoil my perfect record?\" She looked over at the anesthesiologist, who would give the patient an epidural anesthesia, a saddle block. Paige took a deep breath and nodded. The operation began. \"Scalpel.\" As Paige was about to make the first cut through the skin, the circulating nurse said something. \"What?\" \"Would you like some music, doctor?\" It was the first time she had been asked that question. Paige smiled. \"Right. Let\u0027s have some Jimmy Buffet.\" The moment Paige made the first incision, her nervousness vanished. It was as though she had done this all her life. Skillfully, she cut through the first layers of fat and muscle, to the site of the hernia. All the while, she was aware of the familiar litany that was echoing through the room. \"Sponge... .\" \"Give me a bovie. ...\" \"There it is... .\" \"Looks like we got there just in time. ...\" \"Clamp. ...\" \"Suction, please. ...\" Paige\u0027s mind was totally focused on what she was doing. Locate the hernial sac ... free it ... place the contents back into the abdominal cavity ... tie off the base of the sac ... cut off the remainder ... inguinal ...ring ... suture it ... One hour and twenty minutes after the first incision, the operation was finished. Paige should have felt drained, but instead she felt wildly exhilarated. When Walter Herzog had been sewn up, the scrub nurse turned to Paige. \"Dr. Taylor ...\" Paige looked up. \"Yes?\" The nurse grinned. \"That was beautiful, doctor.\" It was Sunday and the three women had the day off. \"What should we do today?\" Kat asked. Paige had an idea. \"It\u0027s such a lovely day, why don\u0027t we drive out to Tree Park? We can pack a picnic lunch and eat outdoors.\" \"That sounds lovely,\" Honey said. \"Let\u0027s do it!\" Kat agreed. The telephone rang. The three of them stared at it. \"Jesus!\" Kat said. \"I thought Lincoln freed us. Don\u0027t answer it. It\u0027s our day off.\" \"We have no days off,\" Paige reminded her. Kat walked over to the telephone and picked it up. \"Dr. Hunter.\" She listened for a moment and handed the telephone to Paige. \"It\u0027s for you, Dr. Taylor.\" Paige said resignedly, \"Right.\" She picked up the receiver. \"Dr. Taylor... . Hello, Tom... . What? ... No, I was just going out. ... I see. ... All right. I\u0027ll be there in fifteen minutes.\" She replaced the receiver. So much for the picnic, she thought. \"Is it bad?\" Honey asked. \"Yes, we\u0027re about to lose a patient. I\u0027ll try to be back for dinner tonight.\" When Paige arrived at the hospital, she drove into the doctors\u0027 parking lot and parked next to the new bright red Ferrari. I wonder how many operations it took to pay for that! Twenty minutes later, Paige was walking into the visitors\u0027 waiting room. A man in a dark suit was seated in a chair, staring out the window. \"Mr. Newton?\" He rose to his feet. \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m Dr. Taylor. I was just in to see your little boy. He was brought in with abdominal pains.\" \"Yes. I\u0027m going to take him home.\" \"I\u0027m afraid not. Peter has a ruptured spleen. He needs an immediate transfusion and an operation, or he\u0027ll die.\" Mr. Newton shook his head. \"We are Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. The Lord will not let him die, and I will not let him be tainted with someone else\u0027s blood. It was my wife who brought him here. She will be punished for that.\" \"Mr. Newton, I don\u0027t think you understand how serious the situation is. If we don\u0027t operate right away, your son is going to die.\" The man looked at her and smiled. \"You don\u0027t know God\u0027s ways, do you?\" Paige was angry. \"I may not know a lot about God\u0027s ways, but I do know a lot about a ruptured spleen.\" She took out a piece of paper. \"He\u0027s a minor, so you\u0027ll have to sign this consent form for him.\" She held it out. \"And if I don\u0027t sign it?\" \"Why ... then we can\u0027t operate.\" He nodded. \"Do you think your powers are stronger than the Lord\u0027s?\" Paige was staring at him. \"You\u0027re not going to sign, are you?\" \"No. A higher power than yours will help my son, You will see.\" When Paige returned to the ward, six-year-old Peter Newton had lapsed into unconsciousness. \"He\u0027s not going to make it,\" Chang said. \"He\u0027s lost too much blood. What do you want to do?\" Paige made her decision. \"Get him into OR One. Stat.\" Chang looked at her in surprise. \"His father changed his mind?\" Paige nodded. \"Yes. He changed his mind. Let\u0027s move it.\" \"Good for you! I talked to him for an hour and I couldn\u0027t budge him. He said God would take care of it.\" \"God is taking care of it,\" Paige assured him. Two hours and four pints of blood later, the operation was successfully completed. All the boy\u0027s vital signs were strong. Paige gently stroked his forehead. \"He\u0027s going to be fine.\" An orderly hurried into the operating room. \"Dr. Taylor? Dr. Wallace wants to see you right away.\" Benjamin Wallace was so angry his voice was cracking. \"How could you do such an outrageous thing? You gave him a blood transfusion and operated without permission? You broke the law!\" \"I saved a boy\u0027s life!\" Wallace took a deep breath. \"You should have gotten a court order.\" \"There was no time,\" Paige said. \"Ten minutes more and he would have been dead. God was busy elsewhere.\" Wallace was pacing back and forth. \"What are we going to do now?\" \"Get a court order.\" \"What for? You\u0027ve already done the operation.\" \"I\u0027ll backdate the court order one day. No one will ever know the difference.\" Wallace looked at her and began to hyperventilate. \"Jesus!\" He mopped his brow. \"This could cost me my job.\" Paige looked at him for a long moment. Then she turned and started toward the door. \"Paige ...?\" She stopped. \"Yes?\" \"You\u0027ll never do anything like this again, will you?\" \"Only if I have to,\" Paige assured him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-13.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
