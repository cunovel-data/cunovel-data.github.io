{"id":68922,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"It was Honey who arrived at the apartment first and stumbled across Kat\u0027s mutilated body, lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the bathroom, obscenely sprawled against the cold white tiles. A bloodstained curette lay beside her. She had hemorrhaged from her womb. Honey stood there in shock. \"Oh, my God!\" Her voice was a strangled whisper. She knelt beside the body and placed a trembling finger against the carotid artery. There was no pulse. Honey hurried back into the living room, picked up the telephone, and dialed 911. A male voice said, \"Nine-one-one Emergency.\" Honey stood there paralyzed, unable to speak. \"Nine-one-one Emergency ... Hello ... ?\" \"H ... help! I ... There\u0027s ...\" She was choking over her words. \"Sh ... she\u0027s dead.\" \"Who is dead, miss?\" \"Kat.\" \"Your cat is dead?\" \"No!\" Honey screamed. \"Kat\u0027s dead. Get someone over here right away.\" \"Lady ...\" Honey slammed down the receiver. With shaking fingers, she dialed the hospital. \"Dr. T ... Taylor.\" Her voice was an agonized whisper. \"One moment, please.\" Honey gripped the telephone and waited two minutes before she heard Paige\u0027s voice. \"Dr. Taylor.\" \"Paige! You ... you\u0027ve got to come home right away!\" \"Honey? What\u0027s happened?\" \"Kat\u0027s ... dead.\" \"What?\" Paige\u0027s voice was filled with disbelief. \"How?\" \"It ... it looks like she tried to abort herself.\" \"Oh, my God! All right. I\u0027ll be there as soon as I can.\" By the time Paige arrived at the apartment, there were two policemen, a detective, and a medical examiner there. Honey was in her bedroom, heavily sedated. The medical examiner was leaning over Kat\u0027s naked body. A detective looked up as Paige entered the bloody bathroom. \"Who are you?\" Paige was staring at the lifeless body. Her face was pale. \"I\u0027m Dr. Taylor. I live here.\" \"Maybe you can help me. I\u0027m Inspector Burns. I was trying to talk to the other lady who lives here. She\u0027s hysterical. The doctor gave her a sedative.\" \"What ... what do you want to know?\" \"She lived here?\" \"Yes.\" I\u0027m going to have Ken\u0027s baby. How good can it get! \"It looks like she tried to get rid of the kid, and messed it up,\" the detective said. Paige stood there, her mind spinning. When she spoke, she said, \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" Inspector Burns studied her a moment. \"Why don\u0027t you believe it, doctor?\" \"She wanted that baby.\" She was beginning to think clearly again. \"The father didn\u0027t want it.\" \"The father?\" \"Dr. Ken Mallory. He works at Embarcadero County Hospital. He didn\u0027t want to marry her. Look, Kat is - was - it was so painful to say was - a doctor. If she had wanted to have an abortion, there\u0027s no way she would try to do it herself in a bathroom.\" Paige shook her head. \"There\u0027s something wrong.\" The medical examiner rose from beside the body. \"Maybe she tried it herself because she didn\u0027t want anyone else to know about the baby.\" \"That\u0027s not true. She told us about it.\" Inspector Burns was watching Paige. \"Was she alone here this evening?\" \"No. She had a date with Dr. Mallory.\" Ken Mallory was in bed, carefully going over the events of the evening. He replayed every step of the way, making sure there were no loose ends. Perfect, he decided. He lay in bed, wondering why it was taking doorbell rang. Mallory let it ring three times, then got up, put on a robe over his pajamas, and went into the living room. He stood in front of the door. \"Who\u0027s there?\" He sounded sleepy. A voice said, \"Dr. Mallory?\" \"Yes.\" \"Inspector Burns. San Francisco Police Department.\" \"Police Department?\" There was just the right note of surprise in his voice. Mallory opened the door. The man standing in the hall showed his badge. \"May I come in?\" \"Yes. What\u0027s this all about?\" \"Do you know a Dr. Hunter?\" \"Of course I do.\" A look of alarm crossed his face. \"Has something happened to Kat?\" \"Were you with her earlier this evening?\" \"Yes. My God! Tell me what\u0027s happened! Is she all right?\" \"I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news. Dr. Hunter is dead.\" \"Dead? I can\u0027t believe it. How?\" \"Apparently she tried to perform an abortion on herself and it went wrong.\" \"Oh, my God!\" Mallory said. He sank into a chair. \"It\u0027s my fault.\" The inspector was watching him closely. \"Your fault?\" \"Yes. I ... Dr. Hunter and I were going to be married. I told her I didn\u0027t think it was a good idea for her to have a baby now. I wanted to wait, and she agreed. I suggested she go to the hospital and have them take care of it, but she must have decided to ... I ... I can\u0027t believe it.\" \"What time did you leave Dr. Hunter?\" \"It must have been about ten o\u0027clock. I dropped her off at her apartment and left.\" \"You didn\u0027t go into the apartment?\" \"No.\" \"Did Dr. Hunter talk about what she planned to do?\" \"You mean about the ... ? No. Not a word.\" Inspector Burns pulled out a card. \"If you think of anything else that might be helpful, doctor, I\u0027d appreciate it if you gave me a call.\" \"Certainly. I ... you have no idea what a shock this is.\" Paige and Honey stayed up all night, talking about what had happened to Kat, going over it and over it, in shocked disbelief. At nine o\u0027clock, Inspector Burns came by. \"Good morning. I wanted to tell you that I spoke to Dr. Mallory last night.\" \"And?\" \"He said they went out to dinner, and then he dropped her off and went home.\" \"He\u0027s lying,\" Paige said. She was thinking. \"Wait! Did they find any traces of semen in Kat\u0027s body?\" \"Yes, as a matter of fact.\" \"Well, then,\" Paige said excitedly, \"that proves he\u0027s lying. He did take her to bed and - \" \"I went to talk to him about that this morning. He says they had sex before they went out to dinner.\" \"Oh.\" She would not give up. \"His fingerprints will be on the curette he used to kill her.\" Her voice was eager. \"Did you find fingerprints?\" \"Yes, doctor,\" he said patiently. \"They were hers.\" \"That\u0027s imp - Wait! Then he wore gloves, and when he was finished, he put her prints on the curette. How does that sound?\" \"Like someone\u0027s been watching too many Murder, She Wrote television programs.\" \"You don\u0027t believe Kat was murdered, do you?\" \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t.\" \"Have they done an autopsy?\" \"Yes.\" \"And?\" \"The medical examiner is listing it as an accidental death. Dr. Mallory told me she decided not to have the baby, so apparently she - \" \"Went into the bathroom and butchered herself?\" Paige interrupted. \"For God\u0027s sake, inspector! She was a doctor, a surgeon! There\u0027s no way in the world she would have done that to herself.\" Inspector Burns said thoughtfully, \"You think Mallory persuaded her to have an abortion, and tried to help her, and then left when it went wrong?\" Paige shook her head. \"No. It couldn\u0027t have happened that way. Kat would never have agreed. He deliberately murdered her.\" She was thinking out loud. \"Kat was strong. She would have had to be unconscious for him to ... to do what he did.\" \"The autopsy showed no signs of any blows or anything that would have caused her to become unconscious. No bruises on her throat ...\" \"Were there any traces of sleeping pills or ... ?\" \"Nothing.\" He saw the expression on Paige\u0027s face. \"This doesn\u0027t look to me like a murder. I think Dr. Hunter made an error in judgment, and ... I\u0027m sorry.\" She watched him start toward the door. \"Wait!\" Paige said. \"You have a motive.\" He turned. \"Not really. Mallory says she agreed to have the abortion. That doesn\u0027t leave us much, does it?\" \"It leaves you with a murder,\" Paige said stubbornly. \"Doctor, what we don\u0027t have is any evidence. It\u0027s his word against the victim\u0027s, and she\u0027s dead. I\u0027m really sorry.\" Paige watched him leave. I\u0027m not going to let Ken Mallory get away with it, she thought despairingly. Jason came by to see Paige. \"I heard what happened,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t believe it! How could she have done that to herself?\" \"She didn\u0027t,\" Paige said. \"She was murdered.\" She told Jason about her conversation with Inspector Burns. \"The police aren\u0027t going to do anything about it. They think it was an accident. Jason, it\u0027s my fault that Kat is dead.\" \"Your fault?\" \"I\u0027m the one who persuaded her to go out with Mallory in the first place. She didn\u0027t want to. It started out as a silly joke, and then she ... she fell in love with him. Oh, Jason!\" \"You can\u0027t blame yourself for that,\" he said firmly. Paige looked around in despair. \"I can\u0027t live in this apartment anymore. I have to get out of here.\" Jason took her in his arms. \"Let\u0027s get married right away.\" \"It\u0027s too soon. I mean, Kat isn\u0027t even ...\" \"I know. We\u0027ll wait a week or two.\" \"All right.\" \"I love you, Paige.\" \"I love you, too, darling. Isn\u0027t it stupid? I feel guilty because Kat and I both fell in love, and she\u0027s dead and I\u0027m alive.\" The photograph appeared on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday. It showed a smiling Ken Mallory with his arm around Lauren Harrison. The caption read: \"Heiress to Wed Doctor.\" Paige stared at it in disbelief. Kat had been dead for only two days, and Ken Mallory was announcing his engagement to another woman! All the time he had been promising to marry Kat, he had been planning to marry someone else. That\u0027s why he killed Kat. To get her out of the way! Paige picked up the telephone and dialed police headquarters. \"Inspector Burns, please.\" A moment later, she was talking to the inspector. \"This is Dr. Taylor.\" \"Yes, doctor.\" \"Have you seen the photograph in this morning\u0027s Chronicle?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, there\u0027s your motive!\" Paige exclaimed. \"Ken Mallory had to shut Kat up before Lauren Harrison found out about her. You\u0027ve got to arrest Mallory.\" She was almost yelling into the telephone. \"Wait a minute. Calm down, doctor. We may have a motive, but I told you, we don\u0027t have a shred of evidence. You said yourself that Dr. Hunter would have had to be unconscious before Mallory could perform an abortion on her. After I spoke to you, I talked to our forensic pathologist again. There was no sign of any kind of blow that could have caused unconsciousness.\" \"Then he must have given her a sedative,\" Paige said stubbornly. \"Probably chloral hydrate. It\u0027s fast-acting and - \" Inspector Burns said patiently, \"Doctor, there was no trace of chloral hydrate in her body. I\u0027m sorry - I really am - but we can\u0027t arrest a man because he\u0027s going to get married. Was there anything else?\" Everything else. \"No,\" Paige said. She slammed down the receiver and sat there thinking. Mallory has to have given Kat some kind of drug. The easiest place for him to have gotten it would be the hospital pharmacy. Fifteen minutes later, Paige was on her way to Embarcadero County Hospital. Pete Samuels, the chief pharmacist, was behind the counter. \"Good morning, Dr. Taylor. How can I help you?\" \"I believe Dr. Mallory came by a few days ago and picked up some medication. He told me the name of it, but I can\u0027t remember what it was.\" Samuels frowned. \"I don\u0027t remember Dr. Mallory coming by here for at least a month.\" \"Are you sure?\" Samuels nodded. \"Positive. I would have remembered. We always talk football.\" Paige\u0027s heart sank. \"Thank you.\" He must have written a prescription at some other pharmacy. Paige knew that the law required that all prescriptions for narcotics be made out in triplicate - one copy for the patient, one to be sent to the Bureau of Controlled Substances, and the third for the pharmacy\u0027s files. Somewhere, Paige thought, Ken Mallory had a prescription filled. There are probably two or three hundred pharmacies in San Francisco. There was no way she could track down the prescription. It was likely that Mallory had gotten it just before he murdered Kat. That would have been on Saturday or Sunday. If it was Sunday, I might have a chance, Paige thought. Very few pharmacies are open on Sunday. That narrows it down. She went upstairs to the office where the assignment sheets were kept and looked up the roster for Saturday. Dr. Ken Mallory had been on call all day, so the chances were that he had had the prescription filled on Sunday. How many pharmacies were open on Sunday in San Francisco? Paige picked up the telephone and called the state pharmaceutical board. \"This is Dr. Taylor,\" Paige said. \"Last Sunday, a friend of mine left a prescription at a pharmacy. She asked me to pick it up for her, but I can\u0027t remember the name of the pharmacy. I wonder if you could help me.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t see how, doctor. If you don\u0027t know ...\" \"Most drugstores are closed on Sunday, aren\u0027t they?\" \"Yes, but ...\" \"I\u0027d appreciate it if you could give me a list of those that were open.\" There was a pause. \"Well, if it\u0027s important ...\" \"It\u0027s very important,\" Paige assured her. \"Hold on, please.\" There were thirty-six stores on the list, spread all over the city. It would have been simple if she could have gone to the police for help, but Inspector Burns did not believe her. Honey and I are going to have to do this ourselves, Paige thought. She explained to Honey what she had in mind. \"It\u0027s a real long shot, isn\u0027t it?\" Honey said. \"You don\u0027t even know if he filled the prescription on Sunday.\" \"It\u0027s the only shot we have.\" That Kat has. \"I\u0027ll check out the ones in Richmond, the Marina, North Beach, Upper Market, Mission, and Potrero, and you check out the Excelsior, Ingleside, Lake Merced, Western Addition, and Sunset areas.\" \"All right.\" At the first pharmacy Paige went into, she showed her identification and said, \"A colleague of mine, Dr. Ken Mallory, was in here Sunday for a prescription. He\u0027s out of town, and he asked me to get a refill, but I can\u0027t remember the name of it. Would you mind looking it up, please?\" \"Dr. Ken Mallory? Just a moment.\" He came back a few minutes later. \"Sorry, we didn\u0027t fill any prescriptions Sunday for a Dr. Mallory.\" \"Thank you.\" Paige got the same response at the next four pharmacies. Honey was having no better luck. \"We have thousands of prescriptions here, you know.\" \"I know, but this was last Sunday.\" \"Well, we have no prescriptions here from a Dr. Mallory. Sorry.\" The two of them spent the day going from pharmacy to pharmacy. They were both getting discouraged. It was not until late afternoon, just before closing time, that Paige found what she was looking for in a small pharmacy in the Potrero district. The pharmacist said, \"Oh, yes, here we are. Dr. Ken Mallory. I remember him. He was on his way to make a house call on a patient. I was impressed, because not many doctors do that these days.\" No resident ever made house calls. \"What\u0027s the prescription for?\" Paige found she was holding her breath. \"Chloral hydrate.\" Paige was almost trembling with excitement. \"You\u0027re sure?\" \"It says so right here.\" \"What was the patient\u0027s name?\" He looked at the copy of the prescription. \"Spyros Levathes.\" \"Would you mind giving me a copy of that prescription?\" Paige asked. \"Not at all, doctor.\" One hour later, Paige was in Inspector Burns\u0027s office. She laid the prescription on his desk. \"Here\u0027s your proof,\" Paige said. \"On Sunday, Dr. Mallory went to a pharmacy miles away from where he lives, and had this prescription for chloral hydrate filled. He put the chloral hydrate in Kat\u0027s drink, and when she was unconscious, he butchered her to make it look like an accident.\" \"You\u0027re saying he put the chloral hydrate in her drink and then killed her.\" \"Yes.\" \"There\u0027s only one problem with that, Dr. Taylor. There was no chloral hydrate in her body.\" \"There has to be. Your pathologist made a mistake. Ask him to check again.\" He was losing his patience. \"Doctor ...\" \"Please! I know I\u0027m right.\" \" You \u0027re wasting everybody\u0027 s time.\" Paige sat across from him, her eyes fixed on his face. He sighed. \"All right. I\u0027ll call him again. Maybe he did make a mistake.\" Jason picked Paige up for dinner. \"We\u0027re having dinner at my house,\" he said. \"There\u0027s something I want you to see.\" During the drive there, Paige brought Jason up to date on what was happening. \"They\u0027ll find the chloral hydrate in her body,\" Paige said. \"And Ken Mallory will get what\u0027s coming to him.\" \"I\u0027m so sorry about all this, Paige.\" \"I know.\" She pressed his hand against her cheek. \"Thank God for you.\" The car pulled up in front of Jason\u0027s home. Paige looked out of the window and she gasped. Around the green lawn in front of the house was a new white picket fence. She was alone in the dark apartment. Ken Mallory used the key that Kat had given him and moved quietly toward the bedroom. Paige heard his footsteps coming toward her, but before she could move, he had leaped at her, his hands tight around her throat. \"You bitch! You\u0027re trying to destroy me. Well, you aren\u0027t going to snoop around anymore.\" He began squeezing harder. \"I outsmarted all of you, didn\u0027t I?\" His fingers squeezed tighter. \"No one can ever prove I killed Kat.\" She tried to scream, but it was impossible to breathe. She struggled free, and was suddenly awake. She was alone in her room. Paige sat up in bed, trembling. She stayed awake the rest of the night, waiting for Inspector Burns\u0027s phone call. It came at 10:00 A.M. \"Dr. Taylor?\" \"Yes.\" She was holding her breath. \"I just got the third report from the forensic pathologist.\" \"And?\" Her heart was pounding. \"There was no trace of chloral hydrate or any other sedative in Dr. Hunter\u0027s body. None.\" That was impossible! There had to be. There was no sign of any blow or anything that would have caused her to become unconscious. No bruises on her throat. It didn\u0027t make sense. Kat had to have been unconscious when Mallory killed her. The forensic pathologist was wrong. Paige decided to go talk to him herself. Dr. Dolan was in an irritable mood. \"I don\u0027t like to be questioned like this,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve checked it three times. I told Inspector Burns that there was no trace of chloral hydrate in any of her organs, and there wasn\u0027t.\" \"But ...\" \"Is there anything else, doctor?\" Paige looked at him helplessly. Her last hope was gone. Ken Mallory was going to get away with murder. \"I ...I guess not. If you didn\u0027t find any chemicals in her body, then I don\u0027t ...\" \"I didn\u0027t say I didn\u0027t find any chemicals.\" She looked at him a moment. \"You found something?\" \"Just a trace of trichloroethylene.\" She frowned. \"What would that do?\" He shrugged. \"Nothing. It\u0027s an analgesic drug. It wouldn\u0027t put anyone to sleep.\" \"I see.\" \"Sorry I can\u0027t help you.\" Paige nodded. \"Thank you.\" She walked down the long, antiseptic corridor of the morgue, depressed, feeling that she was missing something. She had been so sure Kat had been put to sleep with chloral hydrate. All he found was a trace of trichloroethylene. It wouldn\u0027t put anyone to sleep. But why would trichloroethylene be in Kat\u0027s body? Kat had not been taking any medications. Paige stopped in the middle of the corridor, her mind working furiously. When Paige arrived at the hospital, she went directly to the medical library on the fifth floor. It took her less than a minute to find trichloroethylene. The description read: A colorless, clear, volatile liquid with a specific gravity of 1.47 at 59 degrees F. It is a halogenated hydrocarbon, having the chemical formula CCl CCL:CHCl. And there, on the last line, she found what she was looking for. When chloral hydrate is metabolized, it produces trichloroethylene as a by-product.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-35.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
