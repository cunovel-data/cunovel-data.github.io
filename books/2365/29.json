He was scheduled to have heart surgery. She walked into his room, a nurse and a staff doctor at her side. She smiled warmly and said, \"Good morning, Mr. Cronin.\" They had just extubated him, and there were the marks of adhesive tape around his mouth. IV bottles hung overhead, and the tubing had been inserted in his left arm. Cronin looked over at Paige. \"Who the hell are you?\" \"I\u0027m Dr. Taylor. I\u0027m going to examine you and - \" \"Like hell you are! Keep your fucking hands off me. Why didn\u0027t they send in a real doctor?\" Paige\u0027s smile died. \"I\u0027m a cardiovascular surgeon. I\u0027m going to do everything I can to get you well again.\" \"You\u0027re going to operate on my heart?\" \"That\u0027s right. I ...\" John Cronin looked at the resident and said, \"For Christ\u0027s sake, is this the best this hospital can do?\" \"I assure you, Dr. Taylor is thoroughly qualified,\" the staff doctor said. \"So is my ass.\" Paige said stiffly, \"Would you rather bring in your own surgeon?\" \"I don\u0027t have one. I can\u0027t afford those high-priced quacks. You doctors are all alike. All you\u0027re interested in is money. You don\u0027t give a damn about people. We\u0027re just pieces of meat to you, aren\u0027t we?\" Paige was fighting to control her temper. \"I know you\u0027re upset right now, but - \" \"Upset? Just because you\u0027re going to cut my heart out?\" He was screaming. \"I know I\u0027ll die on the operating table. You\u0027re going to kill me, and I hope they get you for murder!\" \"That\u0027s enough!\" Paige said. He was grinning at her maliciously. \"It wouldn\u0027t look good on your record if I died, would it, doctor? Maybe I will let you operate on me.\" Paige found that she was hyperventilating. She turned to the nurse. \"I want an EKG and a chemistry panel.\" She took one last look at John Cronin, then turned and left the room. When Paige returned an hour later with the reports on the tests, John Cronin looked up. \"Oh, the bitch is back.\" Paige operated on John Cronin at six o\u0027clock the following morning. The moment she opened him up, she knew that there was no hope. The major problem was not the heart. Cronin\u0027s organs showed signs of melanoma. A resident said, \"Oh, my God! What are we going to do?\" \"We\u0027re going to pray that he doesn\u0027t have to live with this too long.\" When Paige stepped out of the operating room into the corridor, she found a woman and two men waiting for her. The woman was in her late thirties. She had bright red hair and too much makeup, and she wore a heavy, cheap perfume. She had on a tight dress that accentuated a voluptuous figure. The men were in their forties, and both had red hair. To Paige, they looked like a circus troupe. The woman said to Paige, \"You Dr. Taylor?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m Mrs. Cronin. These are my brothers. How\u0027s my husband?\" Paige hesitated. She said carefully, \"The operation went as well as could be expected.\" \"Oh, thank God!\" Mrs. Cronin said melodramatically, dabbing at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. \"I\u0027d die if anything happened to John!\" Paige felt as if she were watching an actress in a bad play. \"Can I see my darling now?\" \"Not yet, Mrs. Cronin. He\u0027s in the recovery room. I suggest that you come back tomorrow.\" \"We\u0027ll be back.\" She turned to the men. \"Come along, fellas.\" Paige watched as they walked away. Poor John Cronin, she thought. Paige was given the report the next morning. The cancer had metastasized throughout Cronin\u0027s body. It was too late for radiation treatment. The oncologist said to Paige, \"There\u0027s nothing to do but try to keep him comfortable. He\u0027s going to be in a hell of a lot of pain.\" \"How much time does he have?\" \"A week or two at the most.\" Paige went to visit John Cronin in intensive care. He was asleep. John Cronin was no longer a bitter, vitriolic man, but a human being fighting desperately for his life. He was on a respirator, and being fed intravenously. Paige sat down at his bedside, watching him. He looked tired and defeated. He\u0027s one of the unlucky ones, Paige thought. Even with all the modern medical miracles, there\u0027s nothing we can do to save him. Paige touched his arm gently. After a while, she left. Later that afternoon, Paige stopped by to see John Cronin again. He was off the respirator now. When he opened his eyes and saw Paige, he said drowsily, \"The operation\u0027s over, huh?\" Paige smiled reassuringly. \"Yes. I just came by to make sure that you\u0027re comfortable.\" \"Comfortable?\" he snorted. \"What the hell do you care?\" Paige said, \"Please. Let\u0027s not fight.\" Cronin lay there, silently studying her. \"The other doctor told me you did a good job.\" Paige said nothing. \"I have cancer, don\u0027t I?\" \"Yes.\" \"How bad is it?\" The question posed a dilemma that all surgeons were faced with sooner or later. Paige said, \"It\u0027s pretty bad.\" There was a long silence. \"What about radiation or chemotherapy?\" \"I\u0027m sorry. It would make you feel worse, and it wouldn\u0027t help.\" \"I see. Well ... I\u0027ve had a good life.\" \"I\u0027m sure you have.\" \"You may not think so, looking at me now, but I\u0027ve had a lot of women.\" \"I believe it.\" \"Yeah. Women ... thick steaks ... good cigars .. . You married?\" \"No.\" \"You ought to be. Everyone should be married. I\u0027ve been married. Twice. First, for thirty-five years. She was a wonderful lady. She died of a heart attack.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"It\u0027s okay.\" He sighed. \"Then I got sucked into marrying a bimbo. Her and her two hungry brothers. It\u0027s my fault for being so horny, I guess. Her red hair turned me on. She\u0027s some piece of work.\" \"I\u0027m sure she ...\" \"No offense, but do you know why I\u0027m in this cockamamie hospital? My wife put me here. She didn\u0027t want to waste money on me for a private hospital. This way there\u0027ll be more to leave to her and her brothers.\" He looked up at Paige. \"How much time do I have left?\" \"Do you want it straight?\" \"No ... yes.\" \"A week or two.\" \"Jesus! The pain is going to get worse, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I\u0027ll try to keep you as comfortable as possible, Mr. Cronin.\" \"Call me John.\" \"John.\" \"Life is a bitch, isn\u0027t it?\" \"You said you\u0027ve had a good life.\" \"I did. It\u0027s kinda funny, knowing it\u0027s about over. Where do you think we go?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" He forced a smile. \"I\u0027ll let you know when I get there.\" \"Some medication is on the way. Can I do anything to make you more comfortable?\" \"Yeah. Come back and talk to me tonight.\" It was Paige\u0027s night off, and she was exhausted. \"I\u0027ll come back.\" That night when Paige went back to see John Cronin, he was awake. \"How are you feeling?\" He winced. \"Terrible. I was never very good about pain. I guess I\u0027ve got a low threshold.\" \"I understand.\" \"You met Hazel, huh?\" \"Hazel?\" \"My wife. The bimbo. She and her brothers were here to see me. They said they talked to you.\" \"Yes.\" \"She\u0027s something, ain\u0027t she? I sure got myself into a bundle of trouble there. They can\u0027t wait for me to kick the bucket.\" \"Don\u0027t say that.\" \"It\u0027s true. The only reason Hazel married me was for my money. To tell you the truth, I didn\u0027t mind that so much. I really had a good time with her in bed, but then she and her brothers started to get greedy. They always wanted more.\" The two of them sat there in a comfortable silence. \"Did I tell you I used to travel a lot?\" \"No.\" \"Yeah. I\u0027ve been to Sweden ... Denmark ... Germany. Have you been to Europe?\" She thought about the day at the travel agency. Let\u0027s go to Venice! No, let\u0027s go to Paris! How about London? \"No. I haven\u0027t.\" \"You ought to go.\" \"Maybe one day I will.\" \"I guess you don\u0027t make much money working at a hospital like this, huh?\" \"I make enough.\" He nodded to himself. \"Yeah. You have to go to Europe. Do me a favor. Go to Paris ... stay at the Crillon, have dinner at Maxim\u0027s, order a big, thick steak and a bottle of champagne, and when you eat that steak and drink that champagne, I want you to think of me. Will you do that?\" Paige said slowly, \"I\u0027ll do that one day.\" John Cronin was studying her. \"Good. I\u0027m tired now. Will you come back tomorrow and talk to me again?\" \"I\u0027ll come back,\" Paige said. John Cronin slept.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-29.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
