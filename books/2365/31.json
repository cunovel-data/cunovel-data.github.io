There had been no time for lunch, and dinner had consisted of a sandwich between operations. She fell into her bed and was asleep instantly. She was awakened by the ringing of the telephone. Groggily, Paige reached for the instrument and automatically glanced at the bedside clock. It was three in the morning. \"H\u0027lo?\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Taylor? I\u0027m sorry to disturb you, but one of your patients is insisting on seeing you right away.\"\\n\\n Paige\u0027s throat was so dry she could hardly talk. \"I\u0027m off duty,\" she mumbled. \"Can\u0027t you get someone ...?\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t talk to anyone else. He says he needs you.\"\\n\\n \"Who is it?\"\\n\\n \"John Cronin.\"\\n\\n Paige sat up straighter. \"What\u0027s happened?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. He refuses to speak with anyone but you.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Paige said wearily. \"I\u0027m on my way.\"\\n\\n Thirty minutes later, Paige arrived at the hospital. She went directly to John Cronin\u0027s room. He was lying in bed, awake. Tubes were protruding from his nostrils and his arms.\\n\\n \"Thanks for coming.\" His voice was weak and hoarse.\\n\\n Paige sat down in a chair next to the bed. She smiled. \"That\u0027s all right, John. I had nothing to do, anyway, but sleep. What can I do for you that no one else here at this great big hospital couldn\u0027t have done?\"\\n\\n \"I want you to talk to me.\"\\n\\n Paige groaned. \"At this hour? I thought it was some kind of emergency.\"\\n\\n \"It is. I want to leave.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"That\u0027s impossible. You can\u0027t go home now. You couldn\u0027t get the kind of treatment - \"\\n\\n He interrupted her. \"I don\u0027t want to go home. I want to leave.\"\\n\\n She looked at him and said slowly, \"What are you saying?\"\\n\\n \"You know what I\u0027m saying. The medication isn\u0027t working anymore. I can\u0027t stand this pain. I want out.\"\\n\\n Paige leaned over and took his hand. \"John, I can\u0027t do that. Let me give you some - \"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m tired, Paige. I want to go wherever it is I\u0027m going, but I don\u0027t want to hang around here like this. Not anymore.\"\\n\\n \"John ...\"\\n\\n \"How much time do I have left? A few more days? I told you, I\u0027m not good about pain. I\u0027m lying here like a trapped animal, filled with all these goddam tubes. My body is being eaten away inside. This isn\u0027t living - it\u0027s dying. For God\u0027s sake, help me!\"\\n\\n He was racked by a sudden spasm of pain. When he spoke again, his voice was even weaker. \"Help me ... please ...\"\\n\\n Paige knew what she had to do. She had to report John Cronin\u0027s request to Dr. Benjamin Wallace. He would pass it on to the Administration Committee. They would assemble a panel of doctors to assess Cronin\u0027s condition, and then make a decision. After that, it would have to be approved by ...\\n\\n \"Paige ... it\u0027s my life. Let me do with it as I like.\"\\n\\n She looked over at the helpless figure locked in his pain.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m begging you ...\"\\n\\n She took his hand and held it for a long time. When she spoke, she said, \"All right, John. I\u0027ll do it.\"\\n\\n He managed a trace of a smile. \"I knew I could count on you.\"\\n\\n Paige leaned over and kissed him on the forehead. \"Close your eyes and go to sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Good night, Paige.\"\\n\\n \"Good night, John.\"\\n\\n John Cronin sighed and closed his eyes, a beatific smile on his face.\\n\\n Paige sat there watching him, thinking about what she was about to do. She remembered how horrified she had been on her first day of rounds with Dr. Radnor. She\u0027s been in a coma for six weeks. Her vital signs are failing. There\u0027s nothing more we can do for her. We\u0027ll pull the plug this afternoon. Was it wrong to release a fellow human being from his misery?\\n\\n Slowly, as though she were moving under water, Paige rose and walked to a cabinet in the corner, where a bottle of insulin was kept for emergency use. She removed the bottle and stood there, staring at it. Then she uncapped the bottle. She filled a syringe with the insulin and walked back to John Cronin\u0027s bedside. There was still time to go back. I\u0027m lying here like a trapped animal... . This isn\u0027t living - it\u0027s dying. For God\u0027s sake, help me!\\n\\n Paige leaned forward and slowly injected the insulin into the IV attached to Cronin\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \"Sleep well,\" Paige whispered. She was unaware that she was sobbing.\\n\\n Paige drove home and stayed awake the rest of the night, thinking about what she had done.\\n\\n At six o\u0027clock in the morning, she received a telephone call from one of the residents at the hospital.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to give you bad news, Dr. Taylor. Your patient John Cronin died of cardiac arrest early this morning.\"\\n\\n The staff doctor in charge that morning was Dr. Arthur Kane. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-31.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \\n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \\n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \\n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \\n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
