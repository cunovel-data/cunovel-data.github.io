{"id":68893,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"Cholera? Are you telling me this hospital has a patient with cholera?\" Benjamin Wallace yelled. \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" \"Are you absolutely sure?\" \"No question,\" Dr. Ritter said. \"His stool is swarming with vibrios. He has low arterial pH, with hypotension, tachycardia, and cyanosis.\" By law, all cases of cholera and other infectious diseases must immediately be reported to the state health board and to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. \"We\u0027re going to have to report it, Ben.\" \"They\u0027ll close us down!\" Wallace stood up and began to pace. \"We can\u0027t afford that. I\u0027ll be goddamned if I\u0027m going to put every patient in this hospital under quarantine.\" He stopped pacing for a moment. \"Does the patient know what he has?\" \"No. He doesn\u0027t speak English. He\u0027s from India.\" \"Who has had contact with him?\" \"Two nurses and Dr. Taft.\" \"And Dr. Taft diagnosed it as stomach flu?\" \"Right. I suppose you\u0027re going to dismiss her.\" \"Well, no,\" Wallace said. \"Anyone can make a mistake. Let\u0027s not be hasty. Does the patient\u0027s chart read stomach flu?\" \"Yes.\" Wallace made his decision. \"Let\u0027s leave it that way. Here\u0027s what I want you to do. Start intravenous rehydration - use lactated Ringer\u0027s solution. Also give him tetracycline. If we can restore his blood volume and fluid immediately, he could be close to normal in a few hours.\" \"We aren\u0027t going to report this?\" Dr. Ritter asked. Wallace looked him in the eye. \"Report a case of stomach flu?\" \"What about the nurses and Dr. Taft?\" \"Give them tetracycline, too. What\u0027s the patient\u0027s name?\" \"Pandit Jawah.\" \"Put him in quarantine for forty-eight hours. He\u0027ll either be cured by then or dead.\" Honey was in a panic. She went to find Paige. \"I need your help.\" \"What\u0027s the problem?\" Honey told her. \"I wish you would talk to him. He doesn\u0027t speak English, and you speak Indian.\" \"Hindi.\" \"Whatever. Will you talk to him?\" \"Of course.\" Ten minutes later, Paige was talking to Pandit Jawah. \"Aap ki tabyat kaisi hai?\" \"Karab hai.\" \"Aap jald acha ko hum kardenge.\" \"Bhagwan aap ki soney ga.\" \"Aap ka ilaj hum jalb shuroo kardenge.\" \"Shukria.\" \"Dost kiss Hay hain?\" Paige took Honey outside in the corridor. \"What did he say?\" \"He said he feels terrible. I told him he\u0027s going to get well. He said to tell it to God. I told him we\u0027re going to start treatment immediately. He said he\u0027s grateful.\" \"So am I.\" \"What are friends for?\" Cholera is a disease that can cause death within twenty-four hours from dehydration, or that can be cured within a few hours. Five hours after his treatment began, Pandit Jawah was nearly back to normal. Paige stopped in to see Jimmy Ford. His face lit up when he saw her. \"Hi.\" His voice was weak, but he had improved miraculously. \"How are you feeling?\" Paige asked. \"Great. Did you hear about the doctor who said to his patient, \u0027The best thing you can do is give up smoking, stop drinking, and cut down on your sex life?\u0027 patient said, \u0027I don\u0027t deserve the best. What\u0027s the second best?\u0027\" And Paige knew Jimmy Ford was going to get well. Ken Mallory was getting off duty and was on his way to meet Kat when he heard his name being paged. He hesitated, debating whether or not simply to slip out. His name was paged once more. Reluctantly, he picked up a telephone. \"Dr. Mallory.\" \"Doctor, could you come to ER Two, please? We have a patient here who - \" \"Sorry,\" Mallory said, \"I just checked out. Find someone else.\" \"There\u0027s no one else available who can handle this. It\u0027s a bleeding ulcer, and the patient\u0027s condition is critical. I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re going to lose him if ...\" Damn! \"All right. I\u0027ll be right there.\" I\u0027ll have to call Kat and tell her I\u0027ll be late. The patient in the emergency room was a man in his sixties. He was semiconscious, ghost-pale, perspiring, and breathing hard, obviously in enormous pain. Mallory took one look at him and said, \"Get him into an OR, stat!\" Fifteen minutes later, Mallory had the patient on an operating table. The anesthesiologist was monitoring his blood pressure. \"It\u0027s dropping fast.\" \"Pump some more blood into him.\" Ken Mallory began the operation, working against time. It took only a moment to cut through the skin, and after that, the layer of fat, the fascia, the muscle, and finally the smooth, transparent peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen. Blood was pouring into the stomach. \"Bovie!\" Mallory said. \"Get me four units of blood from the blood bank.\" He began to cauterize the bleeding vessels. The operation took four hours, and when it was over, Mallory was exhausted. He looked down at the patient and said, \"He\u0027s going to live.\" One of the nurses gave Mallory a warm smile. \"It\u0027s a good thing you were here, Dr. Mallory.\" He looked over at her. She was young and pretty and obviously open to an invitation. I\u0027ll get to you later, baby, Mallory thought. He turned to a junior resident, \"Close him up and get him into the recovery room. I\u0027ll check on him in the morning.\" Mallory debated whether to telephone Kat, but it was midnight. He sent her two dozen roses. When Mallory checked in at 6:00 A.M., he stopped by the recovery room to see his new patient. \"He\u0027s awake,\" the nurse said. Mallory walked over to the bed. \"I\u0027m Dr. Mallory. How do you feel?\" \"When I think of the alternative, I feel fine,\" the patient said weakly. \"They tell me you saved my life. This was the damnedest thing. I was in the car on my way to a dinner party, and I got this sudden pain and I guess I blacked out. Fortunately, we were only a block away from the hospital, and they brought me to the emergency room here.\" \"You were lucky. You lost a lot of blood.\" \"They told me that in another ten minutes, I would have been gone. I want to thank you, doctor.\" Mallory shrugged. \"I was just doing my job.\" The patient was studying him carefully. \"I\u0027m Alex Harrison.\" The name meant nothing to Mallory. \"Glad to know you, Mr. Harrison.\" He was checking Harrison\u0027s pulse. \"Are you in any pain now?\" \"A bit, but I guess they have me pretty well doped up.\" \"The anesthetic will wear off,\" Mallory assured him. \"So will the pain. You\u0027re going to be fine.\" \"How long will I have to be in the hospital?\" \"We should have you out of here in a few days.\" A clerk from the business office came in, carrying some hospital forms. \"Mr. Harrison, for our records, the hospital needs to know whether you have medical coverage.\" \"You mean you want to know if I can pay my bill.\" \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t put it like that, sir.\" \"You might check with the San Francisco Fidelity Bank,\" he said dryly. \"I own it.\" In the afternoon, when Mallory stopped by to see Alex Harrison, there was an attractive woman with him. She was in her early thirties, blond and trim, and elegant-looking. She was wearing an Adolfo dress that Mallory figured must have cost more than his monthly salary. \"Ah! Here\u0027s our hero,\" Alex Harrison said. \"It\u0027s Dr. Mallory, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes. Ken Mallory.\" \"Dr. Mallory, this is my daughter, Lauren.\" She held out a slim, manicured hand. \"Father tells me you saved his life.\" He smiled. \"That\u0027s what doctors are for.\" Lauren was looking over him approvingly. \"Not all doctors.\" It was obvious to Mallory that these two did not belong in a county hospital. He said to Alex Harrison, \"You\u0027re coming along fine, but perhaps you\u0027d feel more comfortable if you called your own doctor.\" Alex Harrison shook his head. \"That won\u0027t be necessary. He didn\u0027t save my life. You did. Do you like it here?\" It was a strange question. \"It\u0027s interesting, yes. Why?\" Harrison sat up in bed. \"Well, I was just thinking. A good-looking fellow as capable as you are could have a damned bright future. I don\u0027t think you have much of a future in a place like this.\" \"Well, I ...\" \"Maybe it was fate that brought me here.\" Lauren spoke up. \"I think what my father is trying to say is that he would like to show you his appreciation.\" \"Lauren is right. You and I should have a serious talk when I get out of here. I\u0027d like you to come up to the house for dinner.\" Mallory looked at Lauren and said slowly, \"I\u0027d like that.\" And it changed his life. Ken Mallory was having a surprisingly difficult time getting together with Kat. \"How\u0027s Monday night, Kat?\" \"Wonderful.\" \"Good. I\u0027ll pick you up at - \" \"Wait! I just remembered. A cousin from New York is coming to town for the night.\" \"Well, Tuesday?\" \"I\u0027m on call Tuesday.\" \"What about Wednesday?\" \"I promised Paige and Honey that we\u0027d do something together Wednesday.\" Mallory was getting desperate. His time was running out too fast. \"Thursday?\" \"Thursday is fine.\" \"Great. Shall I pick you up?\" \"No. Why don\u0027t we meet at Chez Panisse?\" \"Very well. Eight o\u0027clock?\" \"Perfect.\" Mallory waited at the restaurant until nine o\u0027clock and then telephoned Kat. There was no answer. He waited another half hour. Maybe she misunderstood, he thought. She wouldn\u0027t deliberately break a date with me. The following morning, he saw Kat at the hospital. She ran up to him. \"Oh, Ken, I\u0027m so sorry! It was the silliest thing. I decided to take a little nap before our date. I fell asleep and when I woke up it was the middle of the night. Poor darling. Did you wait for me long?\" \"No, no. It\u0027s all right.\" The stupid womanl He moved closer to her. \"I want to finish what we started, baby. I go crazy when I think about you.\" \"Me, too,\" Kat said. \"I can\u0027t wait.\" \"Maybe next weekend we can ...\" \"Oh, dear. I\u0027m busy over the weekend.\" And so it went. The clock was running. Kat was reporting events to Paige when her beeper went off. \"Excuse me.\" Kat picked up a telephone. \"Dr. Hunter.\" She listened a moment. \"Thanks. I\u0027ll be right there.\" She replaced the receiver. \"I have to go. Emergency.\" Paige sighed. \"What else is new?\" Kat strode down the corridor and took an elevator down to the emergency room. Inside were two dozen cots, all of them occupied. Kat thought of it as the suffering room, filled day and night with victims of automobile accidents, gunshots or knife wounds, and twisted limbs. A kaleidoscope of broken lives. To Kat it was a small corner of hell. An orderly hurried up to her. \"Dr. Hunter ...\" \"What have we got?\" Kat asked. They were moving toward a cot at the far end of the room. \"He\u0027s unconscious. It looks as though someone beat him up. His face and head are battered, he has a broken nose, a dislocated shoulder blade, at least two different fractures to his right arm, and ...\" \"Why did you call me?\" \"The paramedics think there\u0027s a head injury. There could be brain damage.\" They had reached the cot where the victim lay. His face was caked with blood, swollen and bruised. He was wearing alligator shoes and ... Kat\u0027s heart skipped a beat. She leaned forward and took a closer look. It was Lou Dinetto. Kat ran skillful fingers over his scalp and examined his eyes. There was a definite concussion. She hurried over to a telephone and dialed. \"This is Dr. Hunter. I want a head CAT scan done. The patient\u0027s name is Dinetto. Lou Dinetto. Send down a gurney, stat.\" Kat replaced the receiver and turned her attention back to Dinetto. She said to the orderly, \"Stay with him. When the gurney arrives, take him to the third floor. I\u0027ll be waiting.\" Thirty minutes later on the third floor, Kat was studying the CAT scan she had ordered. \"He has some brain hemorrhaging, he has a high fever, and he\u0027s in shock. I want him stabilized for twenty-four hours. I\u0027ll decide then when we\u0027ll operate.\" Kat wondered whether what had happened to Dinetto might affect Mike. And how. Paige stopped by to see Jimmy. He was feeling much better. \"Did you hear about the flasher in the garment district? He walked up to a little old lady and opened up his raincoat. She studied him a moment and said, \u0027You call that a lining?\u0027 \" Kat was having dinner with Mallory at an intimate little restaurant near the bay. Seated across from Mallory, studying him, Kat felt guilty. I should never have started this, she thought. I know what he is, and yet I\u0027m having a wonderful time. Damn the man! But I can\u0027t stop our plan now. They had finished their coffee. Kat leaned forward. \"Can we go to your place, Ken?\" \"You bet!\" Finally, Mallory thought. Kat shifted in her chair uncomfortably and frowned. \"Uh, oh!\" \"Are you all right?\" Mallory asked. \"I don\u0027t know. Would you excuse me for a moment?\" \"Certainly.\" He watched her get up and head for the ladies\u0027 room. When she returned, she said, \"It\u0027s bad timing, darling. I\u0027m so sorry. You\u0027d better get me home.\" He stared at her, trying to conceal his frustration. The damned fates were conspiring against him. \"Right,\" Mallory said curtly. He was ready to explode. He was going to lose a precious five days. Five minutes after Kat returned to the apartment, the front doorbell rang. Kat smiled to herself. Mallory had found an excuse to come back, and she hated herself for being so pleased. She walked over to the door and opened it. \"Ken ...\" Rhino and the Shadow were standing there. Kat felt a sudden sense of fear. The two men pushed past her into the apartment. Rhino spoke. \"You doin\u0027 the operation on Mr. Dinetto?\" Kat\u0027s throat was dry. \"Yes.\" \"We don\u0027t want anything to happen to him.\" \"Neither do I,\" Kat said. \"Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me. I\u0027m tired and - \" \"Is there a chance he\u0027ll die?\" the Shadow asked. Kat hesitated. \"In brain surgery there\u0027s always a risk of - \" \"You better not let it happen.\" \"Believe me, I - \" \"Don\u0027t let it happen.\" He looked at Rhino. \"Let\u0027s go-\" Kat watched them start to leave. At the door, the Shadow turned and said, \"Say hello to Mike for us.\" Kat was suddenly very still. \"Is ... is this some kind of threat?\" \"We don\u0027t threaten people, doc. We\u0027re telling you. If Mr. Dinetto dies, you and your fucking family are gonna be wiped out.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-21.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires...
