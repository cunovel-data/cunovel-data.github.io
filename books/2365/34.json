A maid and a butler had served a six-course dinner, and during dinner he and Alex Harrison - Call me Alex - had chatted about Mallory\u0027s brilliant future. \"Why are you tense?\"\\n\\n Because this pregnant black bitch expects me to marry her. Because any minute word is going to leak out about our engagement and she\u0027ll hear about it and blow the whistle. Because my whole future could be destroyed.\\n\\n He took Lauren\u0027s hand in his. \"I guess I\u0027m working too hard. My patients aren\u0027t just patients to me, Lauren. They\u0027re people in trouble, and I can\u0027t help worrying about them.\"\\n\\n She stroked his face. \"That\u0027s one of the things I love about you, Ken. You\u0027re so caring.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I was brought up that way.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I forgot to tell you. The society editor of the Chronicle and a photographer are coming here Monday to do an interview.\"\\n\\n \"It was like a blow to the pit of his stomach.\"\\n\\n \"Is there any chance you could be here with me, darling? They want a picture of you.\"\\n\\n \"I... I wish I could, but I have a busy day scheduled at the hospital.\" His mind was racing. \"Lauren, do you think it\u0027s a good idea to do an interview now? I mean, shouldn\u0027t we wait until ... ?\"\\n\\n Lauren laughed. \"You don\u0027t know the press, darling. They\u0027re like bloodhounds. No, it\u0027s much better to get it over with now.\"\\n\\n Monday!\\n\\n The following morning, Mallory tracked down Kat in a utility room. She looked tired and haggard. She had no makeup on and her hair was uncurled. Lauren would never let herself go like that, Mallory thought.\\n\\n \"Hi, honey!\"\\n\\n Kat did not answer.\\n\\n Mallory took her in his arms. \"I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about us, Kat. I didn\u0027t sleep at all last night. There\u0027s no one else for me. You were right, and I was wrong. I guess the news came as kind of a shock to me. I want you to have our baby.\" He watched the sudden glow on Kat\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Do you really mean that, Ken?\"\\n\\n \"You bet I do.\"\\n\\n She put her arms around him. \"Thank God! Oh, darling. I was so worried. I don\u0027t know what I would do without you.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to worry about that. From now on, everything is going to be wonderful.\" You\u0027ll never knew how wonderful. \"Look, I have Sunday night off. Are you free?\"\\n\\n She grasped his hand. \"I\u0027ll make myself free.\"\\n\\n \"Great! We\u0027ll have a nice quiet dinner and then we\u0027ll go back to your place for a nightcap. Do you think you can get rid of Paige and Honey? I want us to be alone.\"\\n\\n Kat smiled. \"No problem. You don\u0027t know how happy you\u0027ve made me. Did I ever tell you how much I love you?\"\\n\\n \"I love you, too. I\u0027ll show you how much Sunday night.\"\\n\\n Thinking it over, Mallory decided it was a foolproof plan. He had worked it out to the smallest detail. There was no way Kat\u0027s death could ever be blamed on him.\\n\\n It was too risky to get what he needed from the hospital pharmacy because security had been tightened there after the Bowman affair. Instead, early Sunday morning, Mallory went looking for a pharmacy far away from the neighborhood where he lived. Most of them were closed on Sunday, and he went to half a dozen before he found one that was open.\\n\\n The pharmacist behind the counter said, \"Morning. Can I help you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I\u0027m going to see a patient in this area, and I want to take a prescription to him.\" He pulled out his prescription pad and wrote on it.\\n\\n The pharmacist smiled. \"Not many doctors make house calls these days.\"\\n\\n \"I know. It\u0027s a pity, isn\u0027t it? People just don\u0027t care anymore.\" He handed the slip of paper to the pharmacist.\\n\\n The pharmacist looked at it and nodded. \"This will only take a few minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n Step one.\\n\\n That afternoon, Mallory made a stop at the hospital. He was there no more than ten minutes, and when he left, he was carrying a small package.\\n\\n Step two.\\n\\n Mallory had arranged to meet Kat at Trader Vic\u0027s for dinner, and he was waiting for her when she arrived. He watched her walking toward the table and thought,\\n\\n It\u0027s the Last Supper, bitch.\\n\\n He rose and gave her a warm smile. \"Hello, doll. You look beautiful.\" And he had to admit that she did. She looked sensational. She could have been a model. And she\u0027s great in bed. All she lacks, Ken thought, is about twenty million dollars, give or take a few million.\\n\\n Kat was aware again of how the other women in the restaurant were eyeing Ken, envying her. But he only had eyes for her. He was the old Ken, warm and attentive.\\n\\n \"How was your day?\" Ken asked.\\n\\n She sighed. \"Busy. Three operations in the morning and two this afternoon.\" She leaned forward. \"I know it\u0027s too early, but I swear I could feel the baby kicking when I was getting dressed.\"\\n\\n Mallory smiled. \"Maybe it wants to get out.\"\\n\\n \"We should do an ultrasound test and find out if it\u0027s a boy or a girl. Then I can start buying clothes for it.\"\\n\\n \"Great idea.\"\\n\\n \"Ken, can we set a wedding date? I\u0027d like to have our wedding as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" Mallory said easily. \"We can apply for a license next week.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s wonderful!\" She had a sudden thought. \"Maybe we could get a few days off and go somewhere on our honeymoon. Somewhere not too far away - up to Oregon or Washington.\"\\n\\n Wrong, baby. I\u0027ll be honeymooning in June, on my yacht on the French Riviera.\\n\\n \"That sounds great. I\u0027ll talk to Wallace.\"\\n\\n Kat squeezed his hand. \"Thank you,\" she said huskily. \"I\u0027m going to make you the best wife in the whole world.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure of it.\" Mallory smiled. \"Now eat your vegetables. We want the baby to be healthy, don\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n They left the restaurant at 9:00 P.M. AS they approached Kat\u0027s apartment building, Mallory said, \"Are you sure Paige and Honey won\u0027t be home?\"\\n\\n \"I made sure,\" Kat said. \"Paige is at the hospital, on call, and I told Honey you and I wanted to be alone here.\"\\n\\n She saw the expression on his face. \"Is anything wrong?\"\\n\\n \"No, baby. I told you, I just like our private times to be private.\" I\u0027ll have to be careful, he thought. Very careful. \"Let\u0027s hurry.\"\\n\\n His impatience warmed Kat.\\n\\n Inside the apartment, Mallory said, \"Let\u0027s go into the bedroom.\"\\n\\n Kat grinned. \"That sounds like a great idea.\"\\n\\n Mallory watched Kat undress, and he thought, She still has a great figure. A baby would ruin it.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to get undressed, Ken?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" He remembered the time she had gotten him to undress and then walked out on him. Well, now she was going to pay for that.\\n\\n He took his clothes off slowly. Can I perform! he wondered. He was almost trembling with nervousness. What I\u0027m going to do is her fault. Not mine. I gave her a chance to back out and she was too stupid to take it.\\n\\n He slipped into bed beside her and felt her warm body against his. They began to stroke each other, and he felt himself getting aroused. He entered her and she began to moan.\\n\\n \"Oh, darling ... it feels so wonderful ...\" She began to move faster and faster. \"Yes ... yes ... oh, my God! ... don\u0027t stop ...\" And her body began to jerk spasmodically, and she shuddered and then lay still in his arms.\\n\\n She turned to him anxiously. \"Did you ... ?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Mallory lied. He was much too tense. \"How about a drink?\"\\n\\n \"No. I shouldn\u0027t. The baby ...\"\\n\\n \"But this is a celebration, honey. One little drink isn\u0027t going to hurt.\"\\n\\n Kat hesitated. \"All right. A small one.\" Kat started to get up.\\n\\n Mallory stopped her. \"No, no. You stay in bed, Mama. You have to get used to being pampered.\"\\n\\n Kat watched Mallory as he walked into the living room and she thought, I\u0027m the luckiest woman in the world!\\n\\n Mallory walked over to the little bar and poured scotch into two glasses. He glanced toward the bedroom to make sure he could not be seen, then went over to the couch, where he had placed his jacket. He took a small bottle from his pocket and poured the contents into Kat\u0027s drink. He returned to the bar and stirred Kat\u0027s drink and smelled it. There was no odor. He took the two glasses back to the bedroom, and handed Kat her drink.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s drink a toast to our baby,\" Kat said.\\n\\n \"Right. To our baby.\"\\n\\n Ken watched as Kat took a swallow of her drink.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll find a nice apartment somewhere,\" Kat said dreamily. \"I\u0027ll fix up a nursery. We\u0027re going to spoil our child rotten, aren\u0027t we?\" She took another sip.\\n\\n Mallory nodded. \"Absolutely.\" He was watching her closely. \"How do you feel?\"\\n\\n \"Wonderful. I\u0027ve been so worried about us, darling, but I\u0027m not, not anymore.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" Mallory said. \"You have nothing to worry about.\"\\n\\n Kat\u0027s eyes were getting heavy. \"No,\" she said. \"There\u0027s nothing to worry about.\" Her words were beginning to slur. \"Ken, I feel funny.\" She was beginning to sway.\\n\\n \"You should never have gotten pregnant.\"\\n\\n She was staring up at him stupidly. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You spoiled everything, Kat.\"\\n\\n \"Spoiled ... ?\" She was having trouble concentrating.\\n\\n \"You got in my way.\"\\n\\n \"Wha\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"No one gets in my way.\"\\n\\n \"Ken, I feel dizzy.\"\\n\\n He stood there, watching her.\\n\\n \"Ken ... help me, Ken ...\" Her head fell back onto the pillow.\\n\\n Mallory looked at his watch again. There was plenty of time. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-34.html","bookId":2365,"book":{"id":2365,"title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","description":"Storyline: Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... \\n Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. \\n Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. \\n Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she\u0027d need something more than the brains God gave her. \\n Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nothing-lasts-forever.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 AM"}}
