And back up. She brought that long, hard honey stick into her mouth and opened her throat. Gripping his thighs, she shuttled his cock in and out of her mouth exactly how he liked it.\n Gavin’s legs started to shake and he pumped his pelvis into her face.\n Rielle closed her eyes. Blowing him always made her body throb with want and her pussy slick with readiness. Even her skin seemed stretched too tight.\n “Ree.”\n She kept on plunging his dick in and out.\n “Stop. Please.”\n No way. This was her show. Her prize.\n “Rielle, stop. It feels so goddamned good but I don’t want to come in your mouth.”\n We’ll see about that. She wanted a full taste of him mixed with the honey sliding down her throat.\n Then his hands were on her face, stopping the movement of her head and pulling his dick free from her mouth. She looked up and saw he’d ditched the blindfold too. “Not happy that you’re trying to steal my moment, tycoon.”\n Gavin answering smile was decidedly…animalistic. “Your moment is over. Now it’s my turn.”\n If he put his hands on her anywhere she’d come undone. She couldn’t make this easy on him.\n “You want your turn?” Rielle rolled to her feet. “You’ll have to take it.” She ran out the swinging door.\n She was feeling pretty smug, because she’d basically hobbled him with his pants and underwear, when two steel bands clamped around her upper body, immobilizing her. She screamed. Her heart slammed into her throat.\n “Don’t dare me,” he breathed in her ear, “because I always take it. And I always win.” His mouth latched onto the curve of her throat in that knee-weakening spot and her traitorous legs buckled.\n He laughed.\n Then he spun her around and ripped her blouse open, jerking it down her arms and to the floor. “I’ll pay the sewing bill.” He peeled off her camisole and he pressed his sticky chest to hers, ravishing her with a kiss packed with raw passion, completely erasing her will to do anything but surrender.\n Using his mind-controlling kiss, he herded her backward until her butt connected with the couch.\n Gavin tore his mouth away and bit that same spot on her neck and she fell into him with a startled gasp. “I’m going to bend you over the couch and fuck you, Ree.” He nipped the skin again. “Fuck you hard.”\n She shuddered.\n “Stay right here. But those jeans better be down around your ankles when I get back.”\n Talk about bossy. His sexy, terse commands did it for her in a bad way, yet she had the urge to push his buttons a little. See if she could get that control panel to short out completely. She pulled her jeans down, but left her panties on.\n Gavin strolled into view. That’s when she realized he still wore his suit coat, and his shirt, but he was naked from the waist down—except for his socks. He should’ve looked ridiculous, but damn he looked like sex on legs.\n His eyes blazed, seeing her underwear still on. “Didn’t I tell you—”\n “To lower my jeans? Yes. But you didn’t say anything about my panties.”\n That devilish gleam appeared and she understood she was seriously fucked.\n “Leave them. Just like the first time I fucked you, remember? You said you came so hard you forgot to breathe, so let’s see if we can’t up the ante some.”\n So so so fucked.\n Gavin held up his hand and a skein of yarn dangled from his fingers. “Bend over the couch and put your hands behind your back.”\n “What the hell are you doing with my yarn?”\n “Using it to bind you since I’m fresh out of rope.” When she continued to stare at him, he snapped, “Move it.”\n She whirled around and leaned over the couch.\n “Hands.”\n “Impatient much?”\n Gavin laughed. A little meanly. “You have no idea.”\n Her anticipation skyrocketed as he wound the soft fiber around her wrists.\n “Lift your chest up.”\n As soon as she obeyed, Gavin slid the buffalo robe underneath her. When he pushed her chest down, the incredibly soft hair rubbed her nipples.\n Then his mouth was on her ear again. “There’s one other thing before we get started.” Two sharp smacks landed on her ass cheeks and she yelped. “That’s for leaving your panties on.”\n Gavin kicked her legs out and adjusted her underwear so the elastic stretched directly over her clit. His big hands angled and spread her lower half to his liking.\n Then he plunged into her.\n Rielle arched up. “God.”\n Then he curled his hands over her shoulders, using her body for leverage as he hammered into her. Bottoming out with every thrust, pulling out completely and surging into her pussy again and again.\n The buffalo hair constantly caressed her nipples like soft tongues. Add in the continual friction against her clit and she knew it wouldn’t take long.\n Her ass stung, she couldn’t move her arms, she was utterly at Gavin’s mercy. And she loved every second of it.\n He pressed a kiss at the top of her spine. “You blow my fucking mind, Ree, every time.”\n Gavin owned her. Heart. Soul. Mind. Body. His every primitive groan and animalistic thrust drove that point home.\n “Please—”\n “What will it take to get you there?”\n Mouth dry, brain scrambled, she could barely speak. “You know.”\n “Will it take…this?” He sucked on the side of her throat and it was over.\n The warning flutter in her lower belly lasted a nanosecond before she climaxed. A gasping, shuddering, shattering orgasm. The sensations coalesced. Then her body and mind splintered—her mind cried uncle, the sensations overwhelmed her as her body pulsed and throbbed, screaming more more more.\n Gavin roared, his hips furiously pounding into her pussy with such force the couch slid forward.\n His body shook.\n And shook.\n He layered his chest over her back and panted in her ear. “You destroy me.”\n Something about that sweet masculine bewilderment settled the emotions raging inside her.\n Turning her head, she breathed him in and tenderly kissed his strong jaw.\n “I love you. Jesus, Rielle. I love you so much.”\n “I know. I love you too.”\n “We’re a sticky mess. Let’s get cleaned up.”\n “Okay. But no water games. I have a feeling I’ll be a little sore.”\n “Shit. I’m—”\n “Don’t say it. It’s a good sore, okay?”\n “Okay. But I will point out it still makes you a sore loser.”\n She heard the smirk in his tone. Such a crazy competitive man. But she loved that about him too.\n Chapter Thirty-Four\n Late March…\n Gavin listened to Rielle’s slow breathing as she started to drift off. They were both exhausted but they’d managed to sneak in some alone time for the first time in over a week. She was gearing up for spring planting and he’d been drafted to help with calving.\n Quinn and Ben had a great time teasing him about his missing rancher gene, but Gavin hadn’t minded. He looked forward to spending time with his brothers—even in the dead of night in the miserable cold and snow. Nothing built a brotherly bond faster than having your arms up a cow’s birth canal together. Chase had shown up for a week, claiming to need a break from his pregnancy-hormone-crazed wife, but the truth was he hadn’t wanted to be left out. It was weird having brothers…and yet, not.\n Sierra had made a full recovery after her accident and was at the physical therapy stage. He drove her to Moorcroft for sessions with Keely. He hadn’t replaced her car and so far, Sierra hadn’t asked for a new one, which weighed heavily on his decision to buy her one. If his daughter wasn’t with her best friend, she was hanging out with Boone West. Sierra swore they were just friends and Gavin believed her—he’d never caught them even holding hands. Sierra also spent time with Charlie and Vi, who absolutely doted on her. The entire McKay family had rallied around her after the accident and she fit in with them like she’d always been part of the rowdy clan.\n Which led him to the issue he and Rielle needed to address.\n He idly stroked the side of her breast. “Ree? You awake?”\n “Barely. You wore me out, tycoon. Man. You can do that thing with your tongue anytime.”\n Gavin laughed.\n She yawned. “So now that I’m awake…why am I awake?”\n “We need to talk.”\n Her body stiffened slightly. “Okay. About?”\n “This living arrangement.”\n She rolled over. “What about it?”\n “I don’t want you to build your own place. I want you to stay here, living with me.”\n “Like we’ve been?”\n “No. I want to end the division of your space and my space, and make it all our space. Our home. I want to end the division of our time, too. I want you doing family things with us.” Gavin ran his hand down her arm and threaded his fingers through hers. “This isn’t a fling for me. It hasn’t been from the start. I love you, Ree. I want to spend my life with you. Every part of it.”\n “You’re not just saying that in the wake of smoking-hot sex?”\n He frowned. “Can you be serious—”\n She smothered his protest with a laughing kiss. “You accuse me of being too serious.” She propped her chin on his chest. “The honest truth? I don’t want to build that house. I want to live here with you. I adore Sierra and I know she’s part of the package. That said, I’ve always been so independent and in a short amount of time I find myself depending on you more and more. What if…”\n “What if I leave, and you’ve come to depend on me and I’m no longer there? Honey. That’s not going to happen.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-61.html","bookId":2695,"book":{"id":2695,"title":"Gone Country (Rough Riders #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Gone Country (Rough Riders #14) \n She’s a little bit country, and he’s…not. \n Arizona businessman and long-lost McKay love child Gavin Daniels has been awarded sole custody of his teenage daughter Sierra for one year. In order to steer Sierra back on track after a brush with the law, he pulls up stakes and heads to Wyoming, looking for support from his ranching family...even if he isn’t sure where they fit in the McKay dynamic. He’s prepared for every contingency with the move: the less-than-enthusiastic response from his daughter, learning to run his corporation remotely, but he’s thrown for a loop when his new housemate, Rielle, is a whole lot sexier, funnier and sassier than he remembered. \n Rielle Wetzler has finally overcome the stigma of having hippie parents and being a young single mother. In the two years since she sold her ailing B\u0026B to Gavin Daniels, she’s become financially stable running the homespun businesses she loves. But now Gavin is in Sundance to claim the house that’s rightfully his. Although Rielle knew this day would come, she isn’t prepared to leave the home she built for herself and her now-grown daughter. And to further complicate matters, her long-dormant libido is definitely not ready to live with this newly buff Gavin—who isn’t a cowboy, but has the take-charge attitude to prove he’s all McKay. \n Sharing a roof, their troubles and their triumphs is too much temptation, and before long, Gavin and Rielle are sharing a bed. But sharing their hearts and lives forever? That’s a whole ’nother ball of wax. \n Warning: Contains a feisty, independent heroine who doesn’t need a man to take care of her needs outside the bedroom and a sweet, sexy and bossy hero who’s up to the challenge of proving her wrong\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/gone-country-rough-riders-14.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:55 AM"}}
