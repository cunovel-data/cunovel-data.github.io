His skin gleaming, his muscles straining as he performed a pivot and run body conditioning exercise. The last time she’d spoken to him, he’d talked about a new strength and stamina training regimen. She’d asked tons of questions until he’d offered to demonstrate his new moves, which made her feel a little pervy, but a victorious pervy.\n “Sierra?”\n She said, “What?” offhandedly, keeping her eyes on Boone as he bent forward. Nice buns. But she preferred them in jeans.\n “I said how is Boone supposed to notice you if you’re halfway across the damn football field?”\n “He knows I’m here.”\n “He does? How?” Marin demanded.\n It’d sound like a lie, or at least wishful thinking, if she told Marin she knew Boone had watched her walk the entire way from the gym exit. “He, ah, waved to me.”\n “Huh. I didn’t see that.” Marin stood and brushed the grass from her rear. “You sure you don’t need a ride? I could drop you off on my way home.”\n “Rielle is in town so she offered to pick me up. I’ll be fine hanging out here.”\n “Okay. Call me later.”\n Within three minutes of Marin leaving, Boone strolled over.\n Her belly did that flip, swoop, roll thing even when she acted bored.\n Boone flopped beside her, stretching out on his back and groaning, “Man, I’m so fucking whupped.”\n “No, Hi, Sierra, how are you today? No, I’ve been ditching your calls because I pulled a muscle in my phone dialing finger? Just, I’m so fucking whupped?”\n “Touchy today, aren’t we?” He showered her with a handful of grass.\n “Hey! That’s it. I’m leaving.” Sierra started to stand but Boone grabbed her around the waist and rolled her beside him in the grass, ignoring her yelps.\n He kept his hand on her stomach, holding her in place. “Hey. If it isn’t sexy Sierra McKay. You’re looking damn fine today. Is that a new shirt? It does amazing things for your…eyes.” He aimed a quick grin her direction. “Did you do something different with your hair? The chocolate-colored tresses are so silky and shiny in the sunlight.”\n “You’re a dickhead. And I’m still mad at you.”\n “No, you’re not.”\n “Yes, I am.”\n “Then how come you’re still here?”\n Sierra pointedly looked at his palm that seemed to be burning a hole through her shirt, right to her skin.\n Boone removed his hand. Those striking brown eyes met hers and he lifted his eyebrow in challenge.\n She didn’t move. She stayed right there, gazing into his handsome face, understanding what Marin had meant by mooning over him—wanting what she couldn’t have. Somehow she forced herself to sit up. “You suck at returning text messages, West.”\n “I’ve been studying for finals and covering Alan’s shift since he’s on vacation. Or I’ve been working out.”\n “I can tell. You’ve got some beefy biceps going on.”\n Boone flexed. “Check ’em out.”\n Yes please. She bumped him with her shoulder. “No. It might compromise your virtue if people saw me feeling you up.”\n “Might be worth it.” His intense focus traveled from her eyes to her hair. “Sorry for throwing grass at you.” He leaned close enough she could see his pulse pounding in his throat. “I’ll get it.”\n “Boone—”\n “Relax.”\n She stayed frozen as his fingers started at her scalp and drifted down the strands of her hair with such deliberation she’d swear he was dragging it out.\n You know better.\n “So what did you need to talk to me about?” he asked.\n Sierra’s gaze roved over his face. From his dark eyes, so intent on his task, to his full mouth, his lips parted to release shallow breaths, to his angular jaw. Such a beautiful man. She could just look at him all day.\n “Sierra?” he murmured.\n “Oh. Right. I wanted to see if you were coming to the branding next Saturday. You don’t have to help with the actual work part, just come to the after party.”\n “Why the invite? The McKays need a West whipping boy? Or are your dad, psycho uncles and cousins gonna castrate me?”\n She turned her head and sank her teeth into his wrist. Hard.\n “Jesus, McKay! Let go.”\n She slid her mouth free and licked her lips. “Yep. As salty as I expected.”\n “What’d you do that for?”\n “Because you’re being a dick.”\n “Remind me not to really piss you off,” he muttered.\n “Too late. I’m already mad at you. Anyway, I’m filling in the blanks on the McKay/West feud for the entire McKay family. I wondered if you wanted to be there since you helped with the research.”\n He tucked her hair behind her ear. “I can’t. I’m working a twelve that day.”\n Disappointment flooded her.\n “But I heard there’s a pre-graduation party at Phil Nickels’ parents’ cabin at the lake that night.”\n “Are you going?”\n “I wouldn’t have told you to come if I wasn’t.”\n Close enough to an invite for her. “I’ll show up. Think Angie, Kara and Tyler will be there?”\n His eyes turned cold. “I’ll flatten that fucker Tyler if he comes anywhere near you.”\n “So we’ll have to pretend we’re together again?” Stop acting like that’s what you want. “You have to be tired of that.”\n “Never.” Boone gave her a light head butt that shouldn’t have been sweet, but was. “I gotta get back on track.”\n Sierra groaned.\n “See you around, McKay.”\n Chapter Thirty-Six\n Rielle stayed in the greenhouse long past dark. She’d finished her work hours ago, but she couldn’t force herself to be in the house with happy Gavin and his equally happy sidekick Sierra.\n She was in a mood. This type of surly, sulking mood was rare, but once she became infected with it, look out. Which was why she’d hidden herself away from the people she cared about.\n Gavin wouldn’t track her down. He understood the demands of her business. So with any luck, and with the help of isolation and booze, she’d shake this mood and return to normal tomorrow.\n For the next hour she accomplished exactly nothing except pacing and fretting. Running calculations in her head caused a headache and she threw in the towel. She slipped on her jacket and shut the lights off, her trusty pal Sadie trotting alongside her on the road to the house. On the porch she crouched and hugged her dog. “You’re a good girl, Sadie. Sorry I’ve been lousy company.”\n The house was quiet but she saw the glow from the TV upstairs which meant Gavin was glued to some sporting event. Addicted to sports was better than being addicted to porn, she supposed, but she’d never understand the man’s undying love of the games. Rielle found it ironic the sport Gavin’s brother competed in on a professional level held zero interest for him. He’d watch Chase ride, but he turned the channel the instant Chase was done.\n A long shower removed the dirt but not the black cloud hanging above her. She stared out the window for a while, until she realized if she’d be up all damn night without a sleep aid. She wandered to the kitchen and grabbed a six-pack of Mike’s Hard Lemonade. During her unproductive navel-gazing in her room, she’d already downed half the second bottle when a knock sounded on her door.\n “It’s open.”\n “I heard you in the kitchen. I thought you were still working.” Gavin’s arms encircled her waist and he pressed a kiss on her neck. “Why didn’t you come upstairs?”\n Rielle pointed to the six pack. “I’m lousy company.”\n “I doubt that.”\n “Trust me, it’s true.” She drained the bottle and set it on the windowsill.\n “Would you like to talk about it?”\n “Gavin, I appreciate your concern, but I’m bitchy right now and I’d rather you didn’t see this side of me.”\n His mouth brushed her ear. “Am I to take that as you’ve never been bitchy with me before?”\n “Funny.”\n “Or you think I can’t handle you being less than my Ree of sunshine?” He paused. “Ray of sunshine. Get it?”\n She smiled, in spite of herself. “Yes, I got it.”\n “Were you really going to sleep down here?”\n “Yes.”\n “Well, that sucks. Not only because I looked forward to having my wicked way with you—which I was—but because that means you’ve shut me out. And you know what? I don’t like being shut out.”\n Rielle didn’t detect hurt in his tone, just concern. “I’m sorry. This…sharing your bad day stuff is still new to me.”\n “To me too. But we both know every day won’t be perfect and I want you to be able to tell me what’s eating at you.”\n She always handled stuff on her own. “It’s not a personal thing between us, but a business thing for me.”\n “Oh. Well, that’s different. Fuck this talking about your business shit; if it doesn’t have anything to do with me and you, I’m going to bed.”\n She froze.\n Gavin’s arms tightened around her. “See how crazy that sounds? Ree. I’m in your life. All aspects of it. I’m a pushy dick who won’t leave this—or you—alone until you talk to me.”\n How had she ever gotten so lucky to have this man in her life? She leaned back into him. “I lost the Twin Pines bread account today. Which means I also lost the Creekside B\u0026B account since they’re owned by the same people.” There. She’d said it without choking on it or letting loose a string of profanities. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-65.html","bookId":2695,"book":{"id":2695,"title":"Gone Country (Rough Riders #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Gone Country (Rough Riders #14) \n She’s a little bit country, and he’s…not. \n Arizona businessman and long-lost McKay love child Gavin Daniels has been awarded sole custody of his teenage daughter Sierra for one year. In order to steer Sierra back on track after a brush with the law, he pulls up stakes and heads to Wyoming, looking for support from his ranching family...even if he isn’t sure where they fit in the McKay dynamic. He’s prepared for every contingency with the move: the less-than-enthusiastic response from his daughter, learning to run his corporation remotely, but he’s thrown for a loop when his new housemate, Rielle, is a whole lot sexier, funnier and sassier than he remembered. \n Rielle Wetzler has finally overcome the stigma of having hippie parents and being a young single mother. In the two years since she sold her ailing B\u0026B to Gavin Daniels, she’s become financially stable running the homespun businesses she loves. But now Gavin is in Sundance to claim the house that’s rightfully his. Although Rielle knew this day would come, she isn’t prepared to leave the home she built for herself and her now-grown daughter. And to further complicate matters, her long-dormant libido is definitely not ready to live with this newly buff Gavin—who isn’t a cowboy, but has the take-charge attitude to prove he’s all McKay. \n Sharing a roof, their troubles and their triumphs is too much temptation, and before long, Gavin and Rielle are sharing a bed. But sharing their hearts and lives forever? That’s a whole ’nother ball of wax. \n Warning: Contains a feisty, independent heroine who doesn’t need a man to take care of her needs outside the bedroom and a sweet, sexy and bossy hero who’s up to the challenge of proving her wrong\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/gone-country-rough-riders-14.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:55 AM"}}
