Although Ainsley alluded to it, she never came out and said her intimate relationship with Ben was…more intense.\n “Not until Ben and I decided we wanted the same thing. We didn’t have the added pressure of kids meddling or trying to manipulate our emotions. So is Sierra completely accepting of your relationship with Gavin?”\n “Most days. She’s sixteen, though. One day she’s on top of the world, the next day she’s in the pit of despair. Everything is a crisis in her life. A bad hair day. A B minus on a test. If a friend ignored her in the hallway. Or she’s elated because her favorite song came on the radio. Or if she’s having a good hair day.”\n “Was Rory that way?”\n “Worse. I think most girls are like that. I’d forgotten how small things are such huge angst inducing incidents in teen girls’ lives. Things we dismiss as irrelevant are life changing events in their world. It boggles my mind, what event constitutes a major breakdown and then is easily shrugged off the next day.”\n “Now that you mention it, I remember being exactly like that,” Ainsley said with a groan.\n “Gavin handles it really well. He’s a great father. And I know this will sound weird, but his nurturing, unconditional love and fluid discipline style he shows as Sierra’s father is one of the reasons I was so attracted to him.”\n “You and Gavin are so perfect for each other. The hippie chick and the businessman? Who’da thunk, right? But it works.” Ainsley squealed and hugged her. “I am so thrilled for you—for both of you. Just think, when you and Gavin get married? We’ll be sister-in-laws!”\n Rielle’s belly tumbled. “Married? That’s jumping the gun, isn’t it?”\n “Neither of you went into this relationship thinking it would be casual.”\n “How do you know that?” she demanded.\n “Because I know you.”\n A division of space and time still continued in the house and their relationship. It frustrated her at times; sometimes she welcomed the separation of selves. Despite their declaration of love, neither had spoken of changing their agreed-upon living arrangement.\n Ainsley wandered to the far end of the greenhouse, poking her finger in random peat pots. “I do have another reason for showing up besides to gossip about your love life.”\n Rielle grinned like a loon. She did have a love life. She had a fantastic love life. “And what’s that?”\n “This is a nosy question, so go ahead and get your back up.”\n She snorted. “A nosy question from you? Really?”\n “Yes.” Ainsley set her hands on her hips, in confrontation mode. “So straight up, Ree. Are you planning to cultivate twice as many plants this year since you have twice the growing space?”\n “And this concerns you…how?”\n “Because you already work hard enough for two people. If you double the size of your operation, you’ll be doing the work of four people and as your friend, that really concerns me.”\n Had anyone else stuck their nose in her business like that Rielle would’ve bristled. But Ainsley based her observation on logic, not emotion. “Truth? I feel guilty that half of this top of the line, state of the art, brand spanking new greenhouse isn’t being utilized. I went so far as to scour my seed supplier’s online catalogue. But I realized I can’t do that and have any kind of life outside the gardens. I’ve decided to curtail what I plant, as far as the yield to work ration.”\n “Thank heavens. I know how much of this”—Ainsley gestured to the space around her—“defines who you are. But you need to tend your relationship with Gavin with as much care as you tend your plants.” Her nose wrinkled. “That sounded a lot less hokey in my head.”\n “I get what you mean. And I really appreciate your concern. But I have to ask what prompted this?”\n “Joely. Her patient load is too much for one doctor. So my nagging must’ve worked because she is bringing another doctor into her practice.”\n “Good for her. I’ve hardly seen her in the last four months.”\n “You and me both. A celebration is in order.”\n “I’m in.”\n “I’ll get the ball rolling.” Ainsley frowned and pulled her cell phone out of her pocket. “My darlin’ husband is mighty impatient today, so I gotta get. Take care, Ree.”\n “You too.”\n After bending and lifting and being covered in dirt, Rielle indulged in a long, hot shower—in Gavin’s bathroom. The scent of his body wash sent her thoughts back to how thoroughly Gavin had rocked her world in this shower. He’d defined relentless, making her come three times before allowing his own shuddering release. As much as she loved his commanding side, it didn’t leave her many opportunities to lead the charge in the bedroom.\n That’s an excuse. You want him, show him.\n For the next hour, their previous sexcapades ran on a continual loop. So by the time she heard the front door open, her anticipation for him had reached fever pitch.\n When he strolled into the kitchen, so hip and hot in a sexy-ass black suit, Rielle had to grip the edge of the counter to keep from pouncing on him.\n His eyes registered surprise. “Hey. I thought you’d be in the greenhouse.”\n “I’m done for the day. How was the meeting with Jack and the guys from Lodestone?”\n “Went better than I expected. I’ve always considered myself a tough negotiator, but I’m an amateur compared to Jack Donohue. Jesus. He hammered them on several points, which forced them to shave off a considerable amount of their asking price.” His teeth gleamed in a shark-like smile. “It’s a done deal. Be interesting to see what Jack does with a historic hotel in Whitewood, South Dakota.”\n “He didn’t tell you his plans?”\n “No. I’m just the money man.”\n Her eyes were glued to Gavin’s nimble fingers as he unknotted his tie. When the ends hung beside the lapels, he flicked open the top two buttons on his pristine white dress shirt.\n She said, “Stop.”\n “Stop what?”\n “Stop undressing. I’ll do that.” Rielle ambled toward him. Wrapping the ends of his tie around her fingers, she drew his mouth to hers for a teasing kiss. Licking at his parted lips. Keeping her mouth a whisper away, she began to leisurely unbutton his shirt. “I’ve been thinking about you all afternoon. How hot and sexy you are. How every time you touch me I lose myself in you.”\n “And that’s a bad thing?” he asked softly.\n “Yes, when I’m content letting you have your wicked way with me and I forget turnabout is fair play.” Rielle’s hands were greedy on his bared chest. “I want you. Just like this. Looking professional and a little tight-assed in this snappy suit. But I want you my way. Do you have a problem with that?”\n “Ah. No.”\n She placed a kiss on his sternum. “Put your hands on the counter behind you and don’t move.” She tugged the tie from around his neck, watching it slither free. Holding the body-warmed silk up to her nose, she inhaled. “I love your scent. Cologne and man.”\n Gavin’s eyes were a stormy blue as she snapped the tie between her hands.\n She reached up and draped the silky fabric across his eyes and fashioned a knot at the back of his head. Wouldn’t be light tight, but it’d work for her purposes.\n “Ree. What are you—”\n “This is my show, remember?”\n “How can I see the show with my damn eyes covered?”\n Laughing, she kissed his pouting lips. “Poor baby. You’ll just have to focus on your other four senses, won’t you? Stay put. I’ll be right back.”\n His mouth opened. Then he closed it without a word.\n She couldn’t stop the smug smile as she heated the squeeze jar in the microwave and tested the temp. Using a feather-light touch, she traced the bottom edge of the tie stretched across his eyes. Then her finger moved to outline his lips. “I love this mouth. The things it can do to me…”\n Gavin didn’t lodge a protest as she unbuckled his belt, unzipped his suit pants and dragged them and his boxers to his ankles.\n “Oh, I forgot to mention I’ll pay for dry cleaning.”\n “Dry cleaning?” he repeated hoarsely.\n “Yep. This is gonna get a little messy.” Rielle squeezed the bottle, releasing two thick rivulets of warm honey on his chest.\n He hissed.\n She dug her nails into his hard pectorals as her tongue lapped from the bottom of his ribcage up. She used her teeth to scrape up every bit of sticky goodness on the second stream of honey. Once she’d licked him clean, she reached for the bottle and squirted a dollop above his left nipple, watching as it slowly slid down and coated the dark disk. She attacked, sucking, rubbing the tip of her tongue over the hardened nub. Over and over.\n “Goddamn.”\n Rielle directed the next river of honey down the center of his body. She didn’t begin lapping until the stream teased the top of his belly button.\n Gavin arched into her with a deep groan.\n Drizzling honey all over him had become more than a sexy game. She gloried in eating every amber-colored drop, sometimes ferociously, sometimes delicately, his masculine textures a feast for her senses. While her tongue happily zigzagged here and there, looking for spots of forgotten honey, her hands became stickier. But she couldn’t stop from touching his sides, his ribs, his hips, his abdomen.\n And Gavin made these fucking hot little noises, deep, almost growling whimpers.\n Then Rielle dropped to her knees.\n “Oh, fuck no.”\n “Oh, fuck yes,” she said before her mouth engulfed every inch of his rigid cock. She withdrew slowly and blew a stream of air across the wetness.\n Gavin’s whole body jerked.\n She chuckled and dropped a glob of honey on the sweet spot where his shaft flared into the wide head of his cock. Sucking the sweetness until the only flavor that remained was his. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-60.html","bookId":2695,"book":{"id":2695,"title":"Gone Country (Rough Riders #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Gone Country (Rough Riders #14) \n She’s a little bit country, and he’s…not. \n Arizona businessman and long-lost McKay love child Gavin Daniels has been awarded sole custody of his teenage daughter Sierra for one year. In order to steer Sierra back on track after a brush with the law, he pulls up stakes and heads to Wyoming, looking for support from his ranching family...even if he isn’t sure where they fit in the McKay dynamic. He’s prepared for every contingency with the move: the less-than-enthusiastic response from his daughter, learning to run his corporation remotely, but he’s thrown for a loop when his new housemate, Rielle, is a whole lot sexier, funnier and sassier than he remembered. \n Rielle Wetzler has finally overcome the stigma of having hippie parents and being a young single mother. In the two years since she sold her ailing B\u0026B to Gavin Daniels, she’s become financially stable running the homespun businesses she loves. But now Gavin is in Sundance to claim the house that’s rightfully his. Although Rielle knew this day would come, she isn’t prepared to leave the home she built for herself and her now-grown daughter. And to further complicate matters, her long-dormant libido is definitely not ready to live with this newly buff Gavin—who isn’t a cowboy, but has the take-charge attitude to prove he’s all McKay. \n Sharing a roof, their troubles and their triumphs is too much temptation, and before long, Gavin and Rielle are sharing a bed. But sharing their hearts and lives forever? That’s a whole ’nother ball of wax. \n Warning: Contains a feisty, independent heroine who doesn’t need a man to take care of her needs outside the bedroom and a sweet, sexy and bossy hero who’s up to the challenge of proving her wrong\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/gone-country-rough-riders-14.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:55 AM"}}
