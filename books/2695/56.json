Was that a…snore?\n “Gavin?”\n No response.\n Rielle placed her hands by his head, lifting up to look into his face. It was damn dark in here, but she couldn’t believe what she was seeing.\n Gavin. Asleep. And snoring softly.\n Apparently his dick wasn’t tired because it was still fully erect.\n What the fuck?\n Was her seduction technique so bad, he’d just conked out?\n Tempting to slap him awake. But then…no. This was far too humiliating.\n She got dressed and slunk out.\n Gavin showed up in the kitchen early the next morning, whistling for Christsake. “Good morning, Rielle.”\n She slammed the cupboard door. When she turned around he wore the oddest expression.\n “Did I do something to piss you off?”\n Oh, I don’t know, maybe, possibly, I’m just a teensy bit upset because you fucking fell asleep when I seduced you.\n The oven timer went off. Slipping on her hot mitts, she pulled out the dinner rolls, setting the pan on the cooling racks. She lifted the towel on the next pan and slid it into the oven. When she turned around, she saw Mr. Narcoleptic had helped himself to a cup of coffee.\n Too bad you didn’t drink some coffee last night, buddy.\n “So…I had the weirdest dream about you. I was watching TV upstairs and you showed up. We started going at it hot and heavy. Then you dragged me into my bedroom, where you stripped me and pushed me onto the bed. The way you sucked my cock…”\n “Almost like it was real?” she supplied sweetly.\n “Yes! I watched you perform a strip tease, then you were crawling all over me, rubbing on me, and…”\n “And?”\n “That’s it. I woke up.”\n “Huh. Too bad it ended there.” She headed out the swinging door, but Gavin caught her wrist and pushed her against the wall. “What the hell are you doing?”\n He got right in her face. “No other comment on my dream? Like maybe…it wasn’t a dream but a hazy memory from last night? A very hazy memory.”\n “Let me go.”\n “Why? Got cold feet?”\n Why would he say that? “Have you been drinking?”\n “No. But do you want to explain these?” He eased back, pulling a sock out of his right front pocket, then his left pocket. “I thought your feet might be cold since you forgot your socks in my room last night.”\n “Gimme those.” Rielle snatched them and quickly ducked under his arm.\n But he caught her, shoving her back in place. “Ah ah ah, not so fast. Tell me that I just had an incomplete dream and that I didn’t conk out while you were—”\n “Naked? Rubbing myself all over you like you were my personal stripper pole and then you started snoring? Yes, that did happen.”\n “Jesus, Rielle. I…I don’t remember anything from last night after I checked on Sierra. I sat down to watch ESPN and I woke up this morning, naked in my bed.”\n She studied his eyes. Were they dark with guilt? Remorse? Disbelief?\n “I’m not making an excuse, but this type of…thing has been happening to me.”\n “Oh really.”\n “Really. Two days ago I woke up in the middle of the afternoon on the toilet.”\n “You fell asleep on the toilet?” she asked skeptically.\n “Evidently, for about thirty minutes.” His cheeks colored and he looked embarrassed. “And that is the most mortifying thing I’ve ever had to admit.”\n “Why—”\n “Let me finish. I haven’t been sleeping. I figured as long as I was up, listening for Sierra, I might as well be working. I’ve been catching up on projects every night since Sierra came home from the hospital.” He framed her face in his hands. “Do you really think I’d check out when you were having your wicked way with me if I wasn’t suffering from sleep deprivation?”\n “So you’re not avoiding me?”\n “God no. Why would you say that?”\n “Because you haven’t touched me, or kissed me, or talked to me much since I came home from Denver.”\n Gavin frowned. “Yes I have.”\n “No. You. Haven’t.” She poked his chest with each word.\n “Then I’m sorry.” He sealed his mouth to hers, kissing her in the deviously languid way that nearly melted her fillings. “How many days of missed kisses do I have to make up for, my love?” He brushed his lips across hers. “Six? Seven? Because I can’t have you feeling neglected.” Another soft smooch. “Unwanted.” He rested his forehead to hers. “I love you. And I’m starting to think the reason I haven’t been sleeping is because you haven’t been in my bed.”\n “That comment earns you total forgiveness.”\n “Good. Now if you’ll listen for Sierra, I might slip back into bed for a few hours to try and get my sleep schedule back on track. Because tonight?” He sucked on her lower lip. “You’re mine. As many times as I want you, any way that I want you.”\n Chapter Thirty-One\n Early February…\n Boone appeared a week after Sierra’s accident. Waltzing into her family room like it was no big deal, as she tried not to think about the fact she looked like hell, felt like hell and was embarrassed as hell.\n Then he directed that breath-stealing smile at her the instant her dad was out of range. “McKay, you’re looking a whole lot better than the last time I saw you.”\n She played it cool rather than breaking down in grateful tears the second she saw his face. “Oh, I don’t know. I hear blue lips are the fashion color for spring.”\n He laughed. “I take it you’re on the mend?”\n “The pain isn’t as bad. Sit down. Or aren’t you staying?”\n “I can stay.” He settled next to her, draping his arm along the back of the couch and propping his feet on the coffee table. “Two weeks out of school, huh?”\n “At least two. Probably three.” She groaned. “I’m trying to keep up, but I’m so slow and I can’t write anything with my left hand anyway.”\n “I’m left handed, so it wouldn’t be a problem for me.”\n She stuck her tongue out at him. “So what’s new with you? Saved anyone else from rape, drunk driving and a deadly car accident?”\n “Sierra—”\n “Please let me say this, okay?”\n He nodded.\n “Thank you for all you did for me that night. I vaguely remember you letting me squeeze your hand when the pain was too much as we waited for the ambulance. You made me talk to you and wouldn’t let me fall asleep.”\n “You’re welcome. But I figure we’re even now in the life saving department.”\n “I heard my dad accused you of some stuff in the hospital and he got a little violent. I’m sorry you had to deal with it after…” She cleared her throat. “I know he’s apologized to you and tried to make amends—”\n “Hey. I don’t want anything from either of you, understand?” His fingers traced the bruise on her cheek and the bigger one on her neck. “You have no idea what I…” He refocused on her eyes and stopped touching her. “Anyway, I’m glad you’re all right.”\n “I’m getting there.” Her cheeks grew hot. “Also…thanks for not telling my dad everything that happened before the accident. At the party. Especially that thing with Tyler…I can’t believe I was so stupid.”\n “We all do stupid shit.” A strange expression crossed his face and vanished. “Did you get in trouble for drinking?”\n Sierra pleated the folds of the blanket. “Yes. I’m not supposed to drive for a while but it doesn’t matter since my car is totaled. I’m back to where I was just before Christmas. Carless.” Friendless. “So entertain me. Any good gossip at school?”\n He frowned. “Hasn’t Marin told you?”\n “Marin hasn’t come out to see me.” And Sierra wasn’t about to call her first. She hadn’t heard from anyone, not even Angie and Kara. So much for all the great friends she’d made in the last month.\n “Actually, you and I are in the hot seat of gossip.”\n “Really? Because of the accident?”\n “Mostly. There are interesting rumors going around. Like…we’ve been secretly dating since school started. We had a fight while you were gone over Christmas break and you broke up with me. But we made up at Tyler’s party with loud, raunchy sex. Everyone at the party heard us.”\n Sierra blushed.\n “Then there’s the rumor I purposely crashed your car so I could save you. But that backfired because your father forbid you from ever seeing me again. He took a swing at me and it became a West versus McKay brawl in the hospital waiting room.”\n “You are denying it all, right?”\n Boone grinned. “Nope. I’m thinking of adding fuel to the fire by spending a few hours at India’s Ink. Then the rumors will fly I got your name tattooed on my butt.”\n “Omigod. Boone West! You can’t do that.”\n “Watch me. Anyway, there’s another reason I’m here.”\n “I’m not fixing you lunch.”\n “Glad to see you haven’t lost that bizarre sense of humor, McKay. I’m volunteering to be your study buddy.” He poked her shoulder. “Your right hand man.”\n She groaned at his pun but immediately grew suspicious. “Hey, wait a minute. Did my dad hire you to do this?”\n He raised an eyebrow. “Like I need payment to hang out with you? That hurts.”\n “Sorry. So tell me why you’re volunteering.”\n “Because you’re my girlfriend and you need me.” He made loud kissing noises. “I live to serve you.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-56.html","bookId":2695,"book":{"id":2695,"title":"Gone Country (Rough Riders #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Gone Country (Rough Riders #14) \n She’s a little bit country, and he’s…not. \n Arizona businessman and long-lost McKay love child Gavin Daniels has been awarded sole custody of his teenage daughter Sierra for one year. In order to steer Sierra back on track after a brush with the law, he pulls up stakes and heads to Wyoming, looking for support from his ranching family...even if he isn’t sure where they fit in the McKay dynamic. He’s prepared for every contingency with the move: the less-than-enthusiastic response from his daughter, learning to run his corporation remotely, but he’s thrown for a loop when his new housemate, Rielle, is a whole lot sexier, funnier and sassier than he remembered. \n Rielle Wetzler has finally overcome the stigma of having hippie parents and being a young single mother. In the two years since she sold her ailing B\u0026B to Gavin Daniels, she’s become financially stable running the homespun businesses she loves. But now Gavin is in Sundance to claim the house that’s rightfully his. Although Rielle knew this day would come, she isn’t prepared to leave the home she built for herself and her now-grown daughter. And to further complicate matters, her long-dormant libido is definitely not ready to live with this newly buff Gavin—who isn’t a cowboy, but has the take-charge attitude to prove he’s all McKay. \n Sharing a roof, their troubles and their triumphs is too much temptation, and before long, Gavin and Rielle are sharing a bed. But sharing their hearts and lives forever? That’s a whole ’nother ball of wax. \n Warning: Contains a feisty, independent heroine who doesn’t need a man to take care of her needs outside the bedroom and a sweet, sexy and bossy hero who’s up to the challenge of proving her wrong\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/gone-country-rough-riders-14.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:55 AM"}}
