You and me strolling along the Seine? Kissing on the Eiffel Tower? Checking out the handmade goods at the markets? Sipping wine by candlelight in a cozy café? Rolling around in a big bed in our hotel suite?”\n A couple long seconds passed before she said, “Gavin. I’m…stunned.”\n “Good. Then say yes. We’ll spend two weeks together, just the two of us. You’ll be pampered like you deserve. You won’t have to lift a finger or do anything but relax.” He kissed her again. “You work too damn hard, honey. Let’s take a break.”\n Rielle stepped back. “I can’t afford a trip like that.”\n He tried to curb his offense, but his words came out clipped. “I don’t expect you to pay your way. I was inviting you as my guest.”\n “As your guest?” The look in her eyes and her tone made the word guest sound like whore. “Then definitely not.”\n “I don’t understand.”\n “Neither do I.” She threw up her hands. “Who suggests a Christmas vacation in Paris? Who can just set aside two weeks and go play tourist? Maybe you can, but I sure as hell can’t. I have responsibilities—”\n “Here we go. You act like you’re the only one in the world with a job, Ree. Like the entire state of Wyoming will fall into ruin if you’re not around to do your part.”\n “That’s not fair.”\n “You’re damn right it’s not. You work like a dog. Everybody takes time off once in a while. You never do. So excuse the hell out of me for wanting to give you something you’ve never had.”\n “That’s it, isn’t it? You want to show me all I’ve been missing by taking me to a place I’d never be able to afford to go to on my own. Well guess what? I don’t care about any of that. I never have and I never will.” She clenched her hands into fists. “Don’t try and change me, Gavin. I am who I am.”\n “This has nothing to do with me trying to change you, or seeing it as an opportunity to rub it in your face that I have a bigger bank account than you.”\n “Yeah? Then how come you got so pissed off when you thought Vi was trying to buy Sierra’s affection? How is offering to take me on an all-expenses-paid trip to France any fucking different?”\n “It’s a helluva lot different, but you’re too busy…” Goddammit. Take your own advice. Stop and think before you say something you can’t take back. “It’d be nice if you’d take that damn chip off your shoulder once in a while.”\n “I will. Just as soon as you take that silver spoon out of your mouth.”\n Fuck.\n They were both angry. Breathing hard. Neither willing to back down.\n The timer on her watch started to beep. She spun on her heel and left the room without a word.\n He shouted, “Nice talking to you.”\n That was mature.\n He paced. Then he slumped against the wall. Was he really such a bad guy for wanting to spend some alone time with the woman he loved? Not that he’d told her that.\n Would he ask her to drop everything and go to Paris with him if he wasn’t going for Sierra?\n No.\n Good thing that hadn’t come up, because it did put his offer in a different light.\n Trying to get any work done in this frame of mind would be pointless. He changed clothes and ran five miles on the treadmill. Then he beat the crap out of his heavy bag until he could hardly hold his arms up.\n After a long shower, he felt calmer. In a better frame of mind to tackle the problem, because it wasn’t going away, no matter how much he wished it would.\n Paris.\n What the hell was wrong with him?\n Didn’t Gavin know her at all?\n When had she ever let anyone pay for anything she hadn’t earned?\n Never.\n Being intimately involved with him shouldn’t earn her a trip to France, for Christsake.\n Rielle placed the loaf pans on the cooling racks and loaded the next batch of bread into the oven. She glanced at the time. Noon. Where had this day gone? She set her watch and tackled the stack of dirty dishes.\n Paris.\n Besides, she didn’t have a passport. She angrily scrubbed the dishes. It was mortifying to admit that she’d never been on an airplane. She’d never been anywhere. She and Rory had taken a camping trip to Yellowstone once. She’d been to Denver a number of times. She’d driven into the Rockies. She’d visited the farm and range land in Nebraska. Same with the Black Hills and the prairie in western South Dakota.\n So she couldn’t see herself buying luggage and boarding a plane that’d fly over the ocean when she’d never actually seen the ocean.\n That is not Gavin’s fault.\n Maybe she did have a chip on her shoulder.\n Or worse, maybe she had the fear if Gavin took her someplace sophisticated, she’d embarrass him with her wide-eyed wonder. Maybe he’d realize that if she couldn’t live in his world even temporarily, then he couldn’t live in hers either.\n Damned if she did; damned if she didn’t.\n Once the dishes were done, she updated her short to-do list. This was the slow time of year for her.\n Gavin knew that. Was that why he’d suggested taking a trip now? Because he understood how hard she’d be working again in another few months?\n Possibly. But she didn’t believe it was a coincidence that Sierra’s mother was living in Paris and all of a sudden he planned a trip there. Was he trying to prove something to his ex-wife by inviting Rielle along? Especially since Sierra had mentioned her mother’s boyfriend?\n Another three hours passed. She was thinking it odd she hadn’t seen Sierra or Gavin in the kitchen looking for food, when Sierra walked in.\n Rielle smiled. “I wondered if you were so engrossed in your homework you forgot to eat.”\n Sierra shook her head. “I’m not hungry.”\n That didn’t sound good. “You feel sick?”\n She looked away, but not before Rielle noticed she’d been crying.\n “Hey, sweetheart, what’s wrong?”\n Then Sierra threw her arms around Rielle and sobbed.\n Caught off guard, because this was unlike Sierra, she rubbed circles on the girl’s back, trying to soothe her.\n It must’ve worked because Sierra sighed. “Thanks for the hug, Ree. I’m just having a shitty day.”\n Welcome to the club. “You’d probably feel better if you ate. I made a loaf of pumpkin bread. Would you like some?”\n “Sure.”\n Sierra watched from the breakfast bar as Rielle sliced two pieces and poured a cup of milk.\n A small smile played on Sierra’s lips.\n “What?”\n “It’s like you’re feeding me milk and cookies.”\n “Have you ever seen me bake cookies?”\n Sierra’s brow furrowed. “No. I guess I haven’t.”\n “That’s because I suck at cookies. I burn them. Or I undercook them. Or they’re too big. Or too small. Or they’re too squishy. Or too hard. So I’ll stick to baking breads, rolls and muffins.”\n Sierra pinched off a corner of the bread and popped it in her mouth. “My dad used to eat a big blueberry muffin and a banana every day for breakfast. It drove me crazy because he never ate anything else. If he couldn’t have that then he wouldn’t eat.”\n “I remember. But I’ve yet to see him eat a single muffin since he’s lived here.”\n “Not on his diet anymore. Now he eats cereal or yogurt. Or something else disgustingly healthy.”\n Rielle laughed.\n Sierra broke off a couple more bites. Then she said, “I heard you guys fighting earlier.”\n She blew across her cup of tea. “Does your dad know you overheard?”\n “No. He’s been locked in his office.” Sierra looked up. “My mom wants me to come to Paris for Christmas. He won’t let me fly alone. So that means he’d be stuck in Paris for two weeks.”\n She made a noncommittal noise.\n “My mom…she can be such a bitch to him. She basically said he’d be better off not going to Paris since he doesn’t know the meaning of romance and wouldn’t know what to do with himself.”\n Was that why Gavin had asked her? To prove his ex-wife wrong?\n “I know he asked you to come with him. I know you said no. I don’t understand why you’d say no. I mean, you’re already with him and it wouldn’t be like you’d be doing anything different there than you’re doing here.”\n Insightful little thing.\n “I think you have the wrong impression of him. I mean, since he’s got money you’d think he’d be going cool places all the time. But he’s always working and he’s never taken a two-week vacation.”\n “Never?”\n “He’s never taken a vacation with anyone besides me either. So it’d be a big deal if he did go, especially if he went with you. And just so you know, if you don’t go, he’ll be there by himself. I’m not saying that to make you feel guilty, I’m telling you because I think he deserves to have fun. He should get to be in Paris with someone he cares about. So I’m just asking you to think about it.”\n “Sierra?” Gavin’s voice echoed in the kitchen. He held his phone to his ear. “Your mom is on the line. Come up to my office so we can talk about a few things and get this finalized.”\n That’s when Rielle knew it was too late. Her pride was keeping her from experiencing something amazing. Her pride was also making her question the motives of a man who meant more to her than she’d ever imagined and who needed her support, not her suspicion.\n Rielle, you are a stubborn, arrogant fool for treating Gavin like you did. Buck up and apologize.\n She heated another cup of tea and peeled a tangerine, arranging the crescents around a slice of pumpkin bread. She headed upstairs and waited in the family room as she sussed out what she intended to say. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-42.html","bookId":2695,"book":{"id":2695,"title":"Gone Country (Rough Riders #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Gone Country (Rough Riders #14) \n She’s a little bit country, and he’s…not. \n Arizona businessman and long-lost McKay love child Gavin Daniels has been awarded sole custody of his teenage daughter Sierra for one year. In order to steer Sierra back on track after a brush with the law, he pulls up stakes and heads to Wyoming, looking for support from his ranching family...even if he isn’t sure where they fit in the McKay dynamic. He’s prepared for every contingency with the move: the less-than-enthusiastic response from his daughter, learning to run his corporation remotely, but he’s thrown for a loop when his new housemate, Rielle, is a whole lot sexier, funnier and sassier than he remembered. \n Rielle Wetzler has finally overcome the stigma of having hippie parents and being a young single mother. In the two years since she sold her ailing B\u0026B to Gavin Daniels, she’s become financially stable running the homespun businesses she loves. But now Gavin is in Sundance to claim the house that’s rightfully his. Although Rielle knew this day would come, she isn’t prepared to leave the home she built for herself and her now-grown daughter. And to further complicate matters, her long-dormant libido is definitely not ready to live with this newly buff Gavin—who isn’t a cowboy, but has the take-charge attitude to prove he’s all McKay. \n Sharing a roof, their troubles and their triumphs is too much temptation, and before long, Gavin and Rielle are sharing a bed. But sharing their hearts and lives forever? That’s a whole ’nother ball of wax. \n Warning: Contains a feisty, independent heroine who doesn’t need a man to take care of her needs outside the bedroom and a sweet, sexy and bossy hero who’s up to the challenge of proving her wrong\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/gone-country-rough-riders-14.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:55 AM"}}
