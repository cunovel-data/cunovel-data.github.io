\\n\\n [bbe] Now news came to Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses\u0027 father-in-law, of all God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, and how the Lord had taken Israel out of Egypt. \\n\\n 18:2 [hgb] 便 带 着 摩 西 的 妻 子 西 坡 拉 ， 就 是 摩 西 从 前 打 发 回 去 的 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then Jethro, Moses\u0027 father in law, took Zipporah, Moses\u0027 wife, after he had sent her back, \\n\\n [bbe] And Jethro, Moses\u0027 father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses\u0027 wife, after he had sent her away, \\n\\n 18:3 [hgb] 又 带 着 西 坡 拉 的 两 个 儿 子 ， 一 个 名 叫 革 舜 ， 因 为 摩 西 说 ， 我 在 外 邦 作 了 寄 居 的 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: \\n\\n [bbe] And her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom, for he said, I have been living in a strange land: \\n\\n 18:4 [hgb] 一 个 名 叫 以 利 以 谢 ， 因 为 他 说 ， 我 父 亲 的 神 帮 助 了 我 ， 救 我 脱 离 法 老 的 刀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: \\n\\n [bbe] And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help, and kept me safe from the sword of Pharaoh: \\n\\n 18:5 [hgb] 摩 西 的 岳 父 叶 忒 罗 带 着 摩 西 的 妻 子 和 两 个 儿 子 来 到 神 的 山 ， 就 是 摩 西 在 旷 野 安 营 的 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jethro, Moses\u0027 father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: \\n\\n [bbe] And Jethro, Moses\u0027 father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to where Moses had put up his tent in the waste land, by the mountain of God. \\n\\n 18:6 [hgb] 他 对 摩 西 说 ， 我 是 你 岳 父 叶 忒 罗 ， 带 着 你 的 妻 子 和 两 个 儿 子 来 到 你 这 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law, have come to you, with your wife and your two sons. \\n\\n 18:7 [hgb] 摩 西 迎 接 他 的 岳 父 ， 向 他 下 拜 ， 与 他 亲 嘴 ， 彼 此 问 安 ， 都 进 了 帐 棚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses went out to his father-in-law, and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss; and they said to one another, Are you well? and they came into the tent. \\n\\n 18:8 [hgb] 摩 西 将 耶 和 华 为 以 色 列 的 缘 故 向 法 老 和 埃 及 人 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 以 及 路 上 所 遭 遇 的 一 切 艰 难 ， 并 耶 和 华 怎 样 搭 救 他 们 ， 都 述 说 与 他 岳 父 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel\u0027s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses gave his father-in-law an account of all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians because of Israel, and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way, and how the Lord had given them salvation. \\n\\n 18:9 [hgb] 叶 忒 罗 因 耶 和 华 待 以 色 列 的 一 切 好 处 ， 就 是 拯 救 他 们 脱 离 埃 及 人 的 手 ， 便 甚 欢 喜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jethro was glad because the Lord had been good to Israel, freeing them from the power of the Egyptians. \\n\\n 18:10 [hgb] 叶 忒 罗 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 他 救 了 你 们 脱 离 埃 及 人 和 法 老 的 手 ， 将 这 百 姓 从 埃 及 人 的 手 下 救 出 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jethro said, Praise be to the Lord, who has taken you out of the hand of Pharaoh and out of the hand of the Egyptians; freeing the people from the yoke of the Egyptians. \\n\\n 18:11 [hgb] 我 现 今 在 埃 及 人 向 这 百 姓 发 狂 傲 的 事 上 得 知 ， 耶 和 华 比 万 神 都 大 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them. \\n\\n [bbe] Now I am certain that the Lord is greater than all gods, for he has overcome them in their pride. \\n\\n 18:12 [hgb] 摩 西 的 岳 父 叶 忒 罗 把 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 献 给 神 。 亚 伦 和 以 色 列 的 众 长 老 都 来 了 ， 与 摩 西 的 岳 父 在 神 面 前 吃 饭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jethro, Moses\u0027 father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses\u0027 father in law before God. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Jethro, Moses\u0027 father-in-law, made a burned offering to God: and Aaron came, with the chiefs of Israel, and had a meal with Moses\u0027 father-in-law, before God. \\n\\n 18:13 [hgb] 第 二 天 ， 摩 西 坐 着 审 判 百 姓 ， 百 姓 从 早 到 晚 都 站 在 摩 西 的 左 右 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. \\n\\n [bbe] Now on the day after, Moses took his seat to give decisions for the people: and the people were waiting before Moses from morning till evening. \\n\\n 18:14 [hgb] 摩 西 的 岳 父 看 见 他 向 百 姓 所 作 的 一 切 事 ， 就 说 ， 你 向 百 姓 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 你 为 什 么 独 自 坐 着 ， 众 百 姓 从 早 到 晚 都 站 在 你 的 左 右 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when Moses\u0027 father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? \\n\\n [bbe] And when Moses\u0027 father-in-law saw all he was doing, he said, What is this you are doing for the people? why are you seated here by yourself, with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening? \\n\\n 18:15 [hgb] 摩 西 对 岳 父 说 ， 这 是 因 百 姓 到 我 这 里 来 求 问 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to get directions from God: \\n\\n 18:16 [hgb] 他 们 有 事 的 时 候 就 到 我 这 里 来 ， 我 便 在 两 造 之 间 施 行 审 判 ， 我 又 叫 他 们 知 道 神 的 律 例 和 法 度 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. \\n\\n [bbe] And if they have any question between themselves, they come to me, and I am judge between a man and his neighbour, and I give them the orders and laws of God. \\n\\n 18:17 [hgb] 摩 西 的 岳 父 说 ， 你 这 作 得 不 好 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses\u0027 father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses\u0027 father-in-law said to him, What you are doing is not good. \\n\\n 18:18 [hgb] 你 和 这 些 百 姓 必 都 疲 惫 ， 因 为 这 事 太 重 ， 你 独 自 一 人 办 理 不 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. \\n\\n [bbe] Your strength and that of the people will be completely used up: this work is more than you are able to do by yourself. \\n\\n 18:19 [hgb] 现 在 你 要 听 我 的 话 。 我 为 你 出 个 主 意 ， 愿 神 与 你 同 在 。 你 要 替 百 姓 到 神 面 前 ， 将 案 件 奏 告 神 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: \\n\\n [bbe] Give ear now to my suggestion, and may God be with you: you are to be the people\u0027s representative before God, taking their causes to him: \\n\\n 18:20 [hgb] 又 要 将 律 例 和 法 度 教 训 他 们 ， 指 示 他 们 当 行 的 道 ， 当 作 的 事 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. \\n\\n [bbe] Teaching them his rules and his laws, guiding them in the way they have to go, and making clear to them the work they have to do. \\n\\n 18:21 [hgb] 并 要 从 百 姓 中 拣 选 有 才 能 的 人 ， 就 是 敬 畏 神 ， 诚 实 无 妄 ， 恨 不 义 之 财 的 人 ， 派 他 们 作 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 ， 五 十 夫 长 ， 十 夫 长 ， 管 理 百 姓 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: \\n\\n [bbe] But for the rest, take from among the people able men, such as have the fear of God, true men hating profits wrongly made; and put such men over them, to be captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens; \\n\\n 18:22 [hgb] 叫 他 们 随 时 审 判 百 姓 ， 大 事 都 要 呈 到 你 这 里 ， 小 事 他 们 自 己 可 以 审 判 。 这 样 ， 你 就 轻 省 些 ， 他 们 也 可 以 同 当 此 任 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times: and let them put before you all important questions, but in small things let them give decisions themselves: in this way, it will be less hard for you, and they will take the weight off you. \\n\\n 18:23 [hgb] 你 若 这 样 行 ， 神 也 这 样 吩 咐 你 ， 你 就 能 受 得 住 ， 这 百 姓 也 都 平 平 安 安 归 回 他 们 的 住 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. \\n\\n [bbe] If you do this, and God gives approval, then you will be able to go on without weariness, and all this people will go to their tents in peace. \\n\\n 18:24 [hgb] 于 是 ， 摩 西 听 从 他 岳 父 的 话 ， 按 着 他 所 说 的 去 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. \\n\\n [bbe] So Moses took note of the words of his father-in-law, and did as he had said. \\n\\n 18:25 [hgb] 摩 西 从 以 色 列 人 中 拣 选 了 有 才 能 的 人 ， 立 他 们 为 百 姓 的 首 领 ， 作 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 ， 五 十 夫 长 ， 十 夫 长 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. \\n\\n [bbe] And he made selection of able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens. \\n\\n 18:26 [hgb] 他 们 随 时 审 判 百 姓 ， 有 难 断 的 案 件 就 呈 到 摩 西 那 里 ， 但 各 样 小 事 他 们 自 己 审 判 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. \\n\\n [bbe] And they were judges in the causes of the people at all times: the hard questions they put before Moses; but on every small point they gave decisions themselves. \\n\\n 18:27 [hgb] 此 后 ， 摩 西 让 他 的 岳 父 去 ， 他 就 往 本 地 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses let his father-in-law go away, and he went back to his land. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/412.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;
