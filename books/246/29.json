[bbe] And unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes on which oil has been put, made of the best bread-meal; 29:3 [hgb] 这 饼 要 装 在 一 个 筐 子 里 ， 连 筐 子 带 来 ， 又 把 公 牛 和 两 只 公 绵 羊 牵 来 。 [kjv] And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. [bbe] Put these in a basket and take them, with the ox and the two sheep. 29:4 [hgb] 要 使 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 到 会 幕 门 口 来 ， 用 水 洗 身 。 [kjv] And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. [bbe] And let Aaron and his sons come to the door of the Tent of meeting, and there let them be washed with water. 29:5 [hgb] 要 给 亚 伦 穿 上 内 袍 和 以 弗 得 的 外 袍 ， 并 以 弗 得 ， 又 带 上 胸 牌 ， 束 上 以 弗 得 巧 工 织 的 带 子 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: [bbe] Take the robes, and put the coat and the dress and the ephod and the priest\u0027s bag on Aaron; put the band of needlework round him, 29:6 [hgb] 把 冠 冕 戴 在 他 头 上 ， 将 圣 冠 加 在 冠 冕 上 ， [kjv] And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. [bbe] And let the head-dress be placed on his head and the holy crown on the head-dress. 29:7 [hgb] 就 把 膏 油 倒 在 他 头 上 膏 他 。 [kjv] Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. [bbe] Then take the oil and put it on his head. 29:8 [hgb] 要 叫 他 的 儿 子 来 ， 给 他 们 穿 上 内 袍 。 [kjv] And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. [bbe] And take his sons and put their robes on them; 29:9 [hgb] 给 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 束 上 腰 带 ， 包 上 裹 头 巾 ， 他 们 就 凭 永 远 的 定 例 得 了 祭 司 的 职 任 。 又 要 将 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 分 别 为 圣 。 [kjv] And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest\u0027s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. [bbe] And put the linen bands round Aaron and his sons, and the head-dresses on them, to make them priests by my order for ever: so you are to make Aaron and his sons holy to me. 29:10 [hgb] 你 要 把 公 牛 牵 到 会 幕 前 ， 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 要 按 手 在 公 牛 的 头 上 。 [kjv] And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock. [bbe] Then let the ox be taken in front of the Tent of meeting: and let Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 29:11 [hgb] 你 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 在 会 幕 门 口 ， 宰 这 公 牛 。 [kjv] And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. [bbe] And you are to put the ox to death before the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting. 29:12 [hgb] 要 取 些 公 牛 的 血 ， 用 指 头 抹 在 坛 的 四 角 上 ， 把 血 都 倒 在 坛 脚 那 里 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar. [bbe] Then take some of the blood of the ox, and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, draining out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 29:13 [hgb] 要 把 一 切 盖 脏 的 脂 油 与 肝 上 的 网 子 ， 并 两 个 腰 子 和 腰 子 上 的 脂 油 ， 都 烧 在 坛 上 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. [bbe] And take all the fat covering the inside of the ox, and the fat joining the liver and the two kidneys with the fat round them, and let them be burned on the altar; 29:14 [hgb] 只 是 公 牛 的 皮 ， 肉 ， 粪 都 要 用 火 烧 在 营 外 。 这 牛 是 赎 罪 祭 。 [kjv] But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering. [bbe] But the flesh of the ox and its skin and its waste parts are to be burned outside the circle of the tents, for it is a sin-offering. 29:15 [hgb] 你 要 牵 一 只 公 绵 羊 来 ， 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 要 按 手 在 这 羊 的 头 上 。 [kjv] Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. [bbe] Then take one of the sheep, and let Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 29:16 [hgb] 要 宰 这 羊 ， 把 血 洒 在 坛 的 周 围 。 [kjv] And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. [bbe] Then let it be put to death, so that the sides of the altar are marked with its blood. 29:17 [hgb] 要 把 羊 切 成 块 子 ， 洗 净 五 脏 和 腿 ， 连 块 子 带 头 ， 都 放 在 一 处 。 [kjv] And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head. [bbe] Then the sheep is to be cut up into its parts, and after washing its legs and its inside parts, you are to put them with the parts and the head, 29:18 [hgb] 要 把 全 羊 烧 在 坛 上 ， 是 给 耶 和 华 献 的 燔 祭 ， 是 献 给 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 [kjv] And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. [bbe] And let them all be burned on the altar as a burned offering to the Lord: a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 29:19 [hgb] 你 要 将 那 一 只 公 绵 羊 牵 来 ， 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 要 按 手 在 羊 的 头 上 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. [bbe] Then take the other sheep; and after Aaron and his sons have put their hands on its head, 29:20 [hgb] 你 要 宰 这 羊 ， 取 点 血 抹 在 亚 伦 的 右 耳 垂 上 和 他 儿 子 的 右 耳 垂 上 ， 又 抹 在 他 们 右 手 的 大 拇 指 上 和 右 脚 的 大 拇 指 上 ， 并 要 把 血 洒 在 坛 的 四 围 。 [kjv] Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. [bbe] You are to put the sheep to death, and take some of its blood and put it on the point of Aaron\u0027s right ear, and of the right ears of his sons, and on the thumbs of their right hands and the great toes of their right feet, dropping the rest of the blood on the sides of the altar. 29:21 [hgb] 你 要 取 点 膏 油 和 坛 上 的 血 ， 弹 在 亚 伦 和 他 的 衣 服 上 ， 并 他 儿 子 和 他 儿 子 的 衣 服 上 ， 他 们 和 他 们 的 衣 服 就 一 同 成 圣 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons\u0027 garments with him. [bbe] Then take some of the blood on the altar, and the oil, and put it on Aaron and his robes and on his sons and on their robes, so that he and his robes and his sons and their robes may be made holy. 29:22 [hgb] 你 要 取 这 羊 的 脂 油 和 肥 尾 巴 ， 并 盖 脏 的 脂 油 与 肝 上 的 网 子 ， 两 个 腰 子 和 腰 子 上 的 脂 油 并 右 腿 （ 这 是 承 接 圣 职 所 献 的 羊 ） 。 [kjv] Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: [bbe] Then take the fat of the sheep, the fat tail, the fat covering the insides, and the fat joining the liver and the two kidneys with the fat round them, and the right leg; for by the offering of this sheep they are to be marked out as priests: 29:23 [hgb] 再 从 耶 和 华 面 前 装 无 酵 饼 的 筐 子 中 取 一 个 饼 ， 一 个 调 油 的 饼 和 一 个 薄 饼 ， [kjv] And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD: [bbe] And take one bit of bread and one cake of oiled bread and one thin cake out of the basket of unleavened bread which is before the Lord: 29:24 [hgb] 都 放 在 亚 伦 的 手 上 和 他 儿 子 的 手 上 ， 作 为 摇 祭 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 摇 一 摇 。 [kjv] And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. [bbe] And put them all on the hands of Aaron and of his sons, to be waved for a wave offering before the Lord. 29:25 [hgb] 要 从 他 们 手 中 接 过 来 ， 烧 在 耶 和 华 面 前 坛 上 的 燔 祭 上 ， 是 献 给 耶 和 华 为 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 [kjv] And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. [bbe] Then take them from their hands, and let them be burned on the burned offering on the altar, a sweet smell before the Lord, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 29:26 [hgb] 你 要 取 亚 伦 承 接 圣 职 所 献 公 羊 的 胸 ， 作 为 摇 祭 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 摇 一 摇 ， 这 就 可 以 作 你 的 分 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron\u0027s consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part. [bbe] Then take the breast of Aaron\u0027s sheep, waving it before the Lord; and it is to be your part of the offering. 29:27 [hgb] 那 摇 祭 的 胸 和 举 祭 的 腿 ， 就 是 承 接 圣 职 所 摇 的 ， 所 举 的 ， 是 归 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 的 。 这 些 你 都 要 成 为 圣 ， [kjv] And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: [bbe] So you are to make holy the breast of the sheep which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high, that is, of the sheep which is offered for Aaron and his sons; 29:28 [hgb] 作 亚 伦 和 他 子 孙 从 以 色 列 人 中 永 远 所 得 的 分 ， 因 为 是 举 祭 。 这 要 从 以 色 列 人 的 平 安 祭 中 ， 作 为 献 给 耶 和 华 的 举 祭 。 [kjv] And it shall be Aaron\u0027s and his sons\u0027 by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD. [bbe] And it will be their part as a right for ever from the children of Israel, it is a special offering from the children of Israel, made from their peace-offerings, a special offering lifted up to the Lord. 29:29 [hgb] 亚 伦 的 圣 衣 要 留 给 他 的 子 孙 ， 可 以 穿 着 受 膏 ， 又 穿 着 承 接 圣 职 。 [kjv] And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons\u0027 after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. [bbe] And Aaron\u0027s holy robes will be used by his sons after him; they will put them on when they are made priests. 29:30 [hgb] 他 的 子 孙 接 续 他 当 祭 司 的 ， 每 逢 进 会 幕 在 圣 所 供 职 的 时 候 ， 要 穿 七 天 。 [kjv] And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place. [bbe] For seven days the son who becomes priest in his place will put them on when he comes into the Tent of meeting to do the work of the holy place. 29:31 [hgb] 你 要 将 承 接 圣 职 所 献 公 羊 的 肉 煮 在 圣 处 。 [kjv] And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. [bbe] Then take the sheep of the wave offering and let its flesh be cooked in water in a holy place. 29:32 [hgb] 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 要 在 会 幕 门 口 吃 这 羊 的 肉 和 筐 内 的 饼 。 [kjv] And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. [bbe] And let Aaron and his sons make a meal of it, with the bread in the basket, at the door of the Tent of meeting. 29:33 [hgb] 他 们 吃 那 些 赎 罪 之 物 ， 好 承 接 圣 职 ， 使 他 们 成 圣 ， 只 是 外 人 不 可 吃 ， 因 为 这 是 圣 物 。 [kjv] And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. [bbe] All those things which were used as offerings to take away sin, and to make them holy to be priests, they may have for food: but no one who is not a priest may have them, for they are holy food. 29:34 [hgb] 那 承 接 圣 职 所 献 的 肉 或 饼 ， 若 有 一 点 留 到 早 晨 ， 就 要 用 火 烧 了 ， 不 可 吃 这 物 ， 因 为 是 圣 物 。 [kjv] And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. [bbe] And if any of the flesh of the offering or of the bread is over till the morning, let it be burned with fire; it is not to be used for food, for it is holy. 29:35 [hgb] 你 要 这 样 照 我 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 ， 向 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 行 承 接 圣 职 的 礼 七 天 。 [kjv] And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. [bbe] All these things you are to do to Aaron and his sons as I have given you orders: for seven days the work of making them priests is to go on. 29:36 [hgb] 每 天 要 献 公 牛 一 只 为 赎 罪 祭 。 你 洁 净 坛 的 时 候 ， 坛 就 洁 净 了 ， 且 要 用 膏 抹 坛 ， 使 坛 成 圣 。 [kjv] And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. [bbe] Every day an ox is to be offered as a sin-offering, to take away sins: and by this offering on it, you will make the altar clean from sin; and you are to put oil on it and make it holy. 29:37 [hgb] 要 洁 净 坛 七 天 ， 使 坛 成 圣 ， 坛 就 成 为 至 圣 。 凡 挨 着 坛 的 都 成 为 圣 。 [kjv] Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. [bbe] For seven days you are to make offerings for the altar and make it holy, so that it may become completely holy, and anything touching it will become holy. 29:38 [hgb] 你 每 天 所 要 献 在 坛 上 的 就 是 两 只 一 岁 的 羊 羔 ， [kjv] Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. [bbe] Now this is the offering which you are to make on the altar: two lambs in their first year, every day regularly. 29:39 [hgb] 早 晨 要 献 这 一 只 ， 黄 昏 的 时 候 要 献 那 一 只 。 [kjv] The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: [bbe] One lamb is to be offered in the morning and the other in the evening: 29:40 [hgb] 和 这 一 只 羊 羔 同 献 的 ， 要 用 细 面 伊 法 十 分 之 一 与 捣 成 的 油 一 欣 四 分 之 一 调 和 ， 又 用 酒 一 欣 四 分 之 一 作 为 奠 祭 。 [kjv] And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering. [bbe] And with the one lamb, a tenth part of an ephah of the best meal, mixed with a fourth part of a hin of clear oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering. 29:41 [hgb] 那 一 只 羊 羔 要 在 黄 昏 的 时 候 献 上 ， 照 着 早 晨 的 素 祭 和 奠 祭 的 礼 办 理 ， 作 为 献 给 耶 和 华 馨 香 的 火 祭 。 [kjv] And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. [bbe] And the other lamb is to be offered in the evening, and with it the same meal offering and drink offering, for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 29:42 [hgb] 这 要 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 会 幕 门 口 ， 作 你 们 世 世 代 代 常 献 的 燔 祭 。 我 要 在 那 里 与 你 们 相 会 ， 和 你 们 说 话 。 [kjv] This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. [bbe] This is to be a regular burned offering made from generation to generation, at the door of the Tent of meeting before the Lord, where I will come face to face with you and have talk with you. 29:43 [hgb] 我 要 在 那 里 与 以 色 列 人 相 会 ， 会 幕 就 要 因 我 的 荣 耀 成 为 圣 。 [kjv] And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. [bbe] There I will come face to face with the children of Israel, and the Tent will be made holy by my glory 29:44 [hgb] 我 要 使 会 幕 和 坛 成 圣 ， 也 要 使 亚 伦 和 他 的 儿 子 成 圣 ， 给 我 供 祭 司 的 职 分 。 [kjv] And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest\u0027s office. [bbe] I will make holy the Tent of meeting and the altar: and Aaron and his sons I will make holy, to be my priests 29:45 [hgb] 我 要 住 在 以 色 列 人 中 间 ， 作 他 们 的 神 。 [kjv] And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. [bbe] Among the children of Israel I will make my living-place, and I will be their God. 29:46 [hgb] 他 们 必 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 是 将 他 们 从 埃 及 地 领 出 来 的 ， 为 要 住 在 他 们 中 间 。 我 是 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 。 [kjv] And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God. [bbe] And they will see that I am the Lord their God, who took them out of the land of Egypt, so that I might be ever with them: I am the Lord their God.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/423.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
