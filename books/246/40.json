and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. \n [bbe] And put the table inside, placing all the things on it in order; and put in the support for the lights, and let its lights be burning. \n 40:5 [hgb] 把 烧 香 的 金 坛 安 在 法 柜 前 ， 挂 上 帐 幕 的 门 帘 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. \n [bbe] And put the gold altar for burning perfumes in front of the ark of the law, hanging the curtain over the doorway of the House. \n 40:6 [hgb] 把 燔 祭 坛 安 在 帐 幕 门 前 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. \n [bbe] And put the altar of burned offerings before the doorway of the House of the Tent of meeting. \n 40:7 [hgb] 把 洗 濯 盆 安 在 会 幕 和 坛 的 中 间 ， 在 盆 里 盛 水 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. \n [bbe] And let the washing-vessel, with water in it, be put between the Tent of meeting and the altar. \n 40:8 [hgb] 又 在 四 围 立 院 帷 ， 把 院 子 的 门 帘 挂 上 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. \n [bbe] And put up the hangings forming the open space all round it, with the curtain over its doorway. \n 40:9 [hgb] 用 膏 油 把 帐 幕 和 其 中 所 有 的 都 抹 上 ， 使 帐 幕 和 一 切 器 具 成 圣 ， 就 都 成 圣 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. \n [bbe] And take the holy oil and put it on the House and everything in it, and make it and everything in it holy: \n 40:10 [hgb] 又 要 抹 燔 祭 坛 和 一 切 器 具 ， 使 坛 成 圣 ， 就 都 成 为 至 圣 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. \n [bbe] And put oil on the altar of burned offering, and make it and all its vessels holy; this altar is to be most holy. \n 40:11 [hgb] 要 抹 洗 濯 盆 和 盆 座 ， 使 盆 成 圣 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. \n [bbe] And put oil on the washing-vessel and its base, and make them holy. \n 40:12 [hgb] 要 使 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 到 会 幕 门 口 来 ， 用 水 洗 身 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. \n [bbe] Then let Aaron and his sons come to the door of the Tent of meeting; and after washing them with water, \n 40:13 [hgb] 要 给 亚 伦 穿 上 圣 衣 ， 又 膏 他 ， 使 他 成 圣 ， 可 以 给 我 供 祭 司 的 职 分 ， \n [kjv] And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest\u0027s office. \n [bbe] You are to put on Aaron the holy robes; and you are to put oil on him, and make him holy, so that he may be my priest. \n 40:14 [hgb] 又 要 使 他 儿 子 来 ， 给 他 们 穿 上 内 袍 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: \n [bbe] And take his sons with him and put coats on them; \n 40:15 [hgb] 怎 样 膏 他 们 的 父 亲 ， 也 要 照 样 膏 他 们 ， 使 他 们 给 我 供 祭 司 的 职 分 。 他 们 世 世 代 代 凡 受 膏 的 ， 就 永 远 当 祭 司 的 职 任 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest\u0027s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. \n [bbe] And put oil on them as you did on their father, so that they may be my priests: the putting on of oil will make them priests for ever, from generation to generation. \n 40:16 [hgb] 摩 西 这 样 行 ， 都 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. \n [bbe] And Moses did this; as the Lord gave him orders, so he did. \n 40:17 [hgb] 第 二 年 正 月 初 一 日 ， 帐 幕 就 立 起 来 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. \n [bbe] So on the first day of the first month in the second year the House was put up. \n 40:18 [hgb] 摩 西 立 起 帐 幕 ， 安 上 带 卯 的 座 ， 立 上 板 ， 穿 上 闩 ， 立 起 柱 子 。 \n [kjv] And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. \n [bbe] Moses put up the House; placing its bases in position and lifting up its uprights, putting in the rods and planting the pillars in their places; \n 40:19 [hgb] 在 帐 幕 以 上 搭 罩 棚 ， 把 罩 棚 的 顶 盖 盖 在 其 上 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] Stretching the outer tent over it, and covering it, as the Lord had given him orders. \n 40:20 [hgb] 又 把 法 版 放 在 柜 里 ， 把 杠 穿 在 柜 的 两 旁 ， 把 施 恩 座 安 在 柜 上 。 \n [kjv] And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: \n [bbe] And he took the law and put it inside the ark, and put the rods at its side and the cover over it; \n 40:21 [hgb] 把 柜 抬 进 帐 幕 ， 挂 上 遮 掩 柜 的 幔 子 ， 把 法 柜 遮 掩 了 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] And he took the ark into the House, hanging up the veil before it as the Lord had given him orders. \n 40:22 [hgb] 又 把 桌 子 安 在 会 幕 内 ， 在 帐 幕 北 边 ， 在 幔 子 外 。 \n [kjv] And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. \n [bbe] And he put the table in the Tent of meeting, on the north side outside the veil. \n 40:23 [hgb] 在 桌 子 上 将 饼 陈 设 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. \n [bbe] And he put the bread on it in order before the Lord, as the Lord had said. \n 40:24 [hgb] 又 把 灯 台 安 在 会 幕 内 ， 在 帐 幕 南 边 ， 与 桌 子 相 对 ， \n [kjv] And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. \n [bbe] The support for the lights he put in the Tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side: \n 40:25 [hgb] 在 耶 和 华 面 前 点 灯 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] Lighting the lights before the Lord, as the Lord had given him orders. \n 40:26 [hgb] 把 金 坛 安 在 会 幕 内 的 幔 子 前 ， \n [kjv] And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: \n [bbe] And he put the gold altar in the Tent of meeting, in front of the veil: \n 40:27 [hgb] 在 坛 上 烧 了 馨 香 料 作 的 香 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] Burning sweet perfumes on it, as the Lord had given him orders. \n 40:28 [hgb] 又 挂 上 帐 幕 的 门 帘 。 \n [kjv] And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. \n [bbe] And he put up the curtain at the doorway of the House. \n 40:29 [hgb] 在 会 幕 的 帐 幕 门 前 ， 安 设 燔 祭 坛 ， 把 燔 祭 和 素 祭 献 在 其 上 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] And at the door of the House of the Tent of meeting, he put the altar of burned offerings, offering on it the burned offering and the meal offering, as the Lord had given him orders. \n 40:30 [hgb] 把 洗 濯 盆 安 在 会 幕 和 坛 的 中 间 ， 盆 中 盛 水 ， 以 便 洗 濯 。 \n [kjv] And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. \n [bbe] And between the altar and the Tent of meeting he put the vessel with water in it for washing. \n 40:31 [hgb] 摩 西 和 亚 伦 并 亚 伦 的 儿 子 在 这 盆 里 洗 手 洗 脚 。 \n [kjv] And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: \n [bbe] In it the hands and feet of Moses and Aaron and his sons were washed, \n 40:32 [hgb] 他 们 进 会 幕 或 就 近 坛 的 时 候 ， 便 都 洗 濯 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。 \n [kjv] When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] Whenever they went into the Tent of meeting, and when they came near the altar, as the Lord had given orders to Moses. \n 40:33 [hgb] 在 帐 幕 和 坛 的 四 围 立 了 院 帷 ， 把 院 子 的 门 帘 挂 上 。 这 样 ， 摩 西 就 完 了 工 。 \n [kjv] And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. \n [bbe] And he put up the hangings forming the open space round the House and the altar, and put the curtain over the doorway. So Moses made the work complete. \n 40:34 [hgb] 当 时 ， 云 彩 遮 盖 会 幕 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 就 充 满 了 帐 幕 。 \n [kjv] Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. \n [bbe] Then the cloud came down covering the Tent of meeting, and the House was full of the glory of the Lord; \n 40:35 [hgb] 摩 西 不 能 进 会 幕 ， 因 为 云 彩 停 在 其 上 ， 并 且 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 充 满 了 帐 幕 。 \n [kjv] And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. \n [bbe] So that Moses was not able to go into the Tent of meeting, because the cloud was resting on it, and the House was full of the glory of the Lord. \n 40:36 [hgb] 每 逢 云 彩 从 帐 幕 收 上 去 ， 以 色 列 人 就 起 程 前 往 。 \n [kjv] And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: \n [bbe] And whenever the cloud was taken up from the House, the children of Israel went forward on their journey: \n 40:37 [hgb] 云 彩 若 不 收 上 去 ， 他 们 就 不 起 程 ， 直 等 到 云 彩 收 上 去 。 \n [kjv] But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. \n [bbe] But while the cloud was there, they made no move till it was taken up. \n 40:38 [hgb] 日 间 ， 耶 和 华 的 云 彩 是 在 帐 幕 以 上 。 夜 间 ， 云 中 有 火 ， 在 以 色 列 全 家 的 眼 前 ， 在 他 们 所 行 的 路 上 ， 都 是 这 样 。 \n [kjv] For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. \n [bbe] For the cloud of the Lord was resting on the House by day, and at night there was fire in the cloud, before the eyes of all the people of Israel, and so it was through all their journeys. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/434.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
