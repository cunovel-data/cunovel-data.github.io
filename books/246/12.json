[bbe] Let this month be to you the first of months, the first month of the year. 12:3 [hgb] 你 们 吩 咐 以 色 列 全 会 众 说 ， 本 月 初 十 日 ， 各 人 要 按 着 父 家 取 羊 羔 ， 一 家 一 只 。 [kjv] Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: [bbe] Say to all the children of Israel when they are come together, In the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb, by the number of their fathers\u0027 families, a lamb for every family: 12:4 [hgb] 若 是 一 家 的 人 太 少 ， 吃 不 了 一 只 羊 羔 ， 本 人 就 要 和 他 隔 壁 的 邻 舍 共 取 一 只 。 你 们 预 备 羊 羔 ， 要 按 着 人 数 和 饭 量 计 算 。 [kjv] And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. [bbe] And if the lamb is more than enough for the family, let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them, taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man. 12:5 [hgb] 要 无 残 疾 ， 一 岁 的 公 羊 羔 ， 你 们 或 从 绵 羊 里 取 ， 或 从 山 羊 里 取 ， 都 可 以 。 [kjv] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: [bbe] Let your lamb be without a mark, a male in its first year: you may take it from among the sheep or the goats: 12:6 [hgb] 要 留 到 本 月 十 四 日 ， 在 黄 昏 的 时 候 ， 以 色 列 全 会 众 把 羊 羔 宰 了 。 [kjv] And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. [bbe] Keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month, when everyone who is of the children of Israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark. 12:7 [hgb] 各 家 要 取 点 血 ， 涂 在 吃 羊 羔 的 房 屋 左 右 的 门 框 上 和 门 楣 上 。 [kjv] And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. [bbe] Then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken. 12:8 [hgb] 当 夜 要 吃 羊 羔 的 肉 ， 用 火 烤 了 ， 与 无 酵 饼 和 苦 菜 同 吃 。 [kjv] And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. [bbe] And let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb, cooked with fire in the oven, together with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants. 12:9 [hgb] 不 可 吃 生 的 ， 断 不 可 吃 水 煮 的 ， 要 带 着 头 ， 腿 ， 五 脏 ， 用 火 烤 了 吃 。 [kjv] Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. [bbe] Do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water, but let it be cooked in the oven; its head with its legs and its inside parts. 12:10 [hgb] 不 可 剩 下 一 点 留 到 早 晨 ， 若 留 到 早 晨 ， 要 用 火 烧 了 。 [kjv] And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. [bbe] Do not keep any of it till the morning; anything which is not used is to be burned with fire. 12:11 [hgb] 你 们 吃 羊 羔 当 腰 间 束 带 ， 脚 上 穿 鞋 ， 手 中 拿 杖 ， 赶 紧 地 吃 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 的 逾 越 节 。 [kjv] And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD\u0027s passover. [bbe] And take your meal dressed as if for a journey, with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands: take it quickly: it is the Lord\u0027s Passover. 12:12 [hgb] 因 为 那 夜 我 要 巡 行 埃 及 地 ， 把 埃 及 地 一 切 头 生 的 ， 无 论 是 人 是 牲 畜 ， 都 击 杀 了 ， 又 要 败 坏 埃 及 一 切 的 神 。 我 是 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. [bbe] For on that night I will go through the land of Egypt, sending death on every first male child, of man and of beast, and judging all the gods of Egypt: I am the Lord. 12:13 [hgb] 这 血 要 在 你 们 所 住 的 房 屋 上 作 记 号 ， 我 一 见 这 血 ， 就 越 过 你 们 去 。 我 击 杀 埃 及 地 头 生 的 时 候 ， 灾 殃 必 不 临 到 你 们 身 上 灭 你 们 。 [kjv] And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. [bbe] And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are: when I see the blood I will go over you, and no evil will come on you for your destruction, when my hand is on the land of Egypt. 12:14 [hgb] 你 们 要 记 念 这 日 ， 守 为 耶 和 华 的 节 ， 作 为 你 们 世 世 代 代 永 远 的 定 例 。 [kjv] And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. [bbe] And this day is to be kept in your memories: you are to keep it as a feast to the Lord through all your generations, as an order for ever. 12:15 [hgb] 你 们 要 吃 无 酵 饼 七 日 。 头 一 日 要 把 酵 从 你 们 各 家 中 除 去 ， 因 为 从 头 一 日 起 ， 到 第 七 日 为 止 ， 凡 吃 有 酵 之 饼 的 ， 必 从 以 色 列 中 剪 除 。 [kjv] Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. [bbe] For seven days let your food be unleavened bread; from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses: whoever takes bread with leaven in it, from the first till the seventh day, will be cut off from Israel. 12:16 [hgb] 头 一 日 你 们 当 有 圣 会 ， 第 七 日 也 当 有 圣 会 。 这 两 日 之 内 ， 除 了 预 备 各 人 所 要 吃 的 以 外 ， 无 论 何 工 都 不 可 作 。 [kjv] And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. [bbe] And on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting; no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyone\u0027s food. 12:17 [hgb] 你 们 要 守 无 酵 节 ， 因 为 我 正 当 这 日 把 你 们 的 军 队 从 埃 及 地 领 出 来 。 所 以 ， 你 们 要 守 这 日 ， 作 为 世 世 代 代 永 远 的 定 例 。 [kjv] And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. [bbe] So keep the feast of unleavened bread; for on this very day I have taken your armies out of the land of Egypt: this day, then, is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever. 12:18 [hgb] 从 正 月 十 四 日 晚 上 ， 直 到 二 十 一 日 晚 上 ， 你 们 要 吃 无 酵 饼 。 [kjv] In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. [bbe] In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day, let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty-first day of the month. 12:19 [hgb] 在 你 们 各 家 中 ， 七 日 之 内 不 可 有 酵 ， 因 为 凡 吃 有 酵 之 物 的 ， 无 论 是 寄 居 的 ， 是 本 地 的 ， 必 从 以 色 列 的 会 中 剪 除 。 [kjv] Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. [bbe] For seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses: for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of Israel, if he is from another country or if he is an Israelite by birth. 12:20 [hgb] 有 酵 的 物 ， 你 们 都 不 可 吃 ， 在 你 们 一 切 住 处 要 吃 无 酵 饼 。 [kjv] Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. [bbe] Take nothing which has leaven in it; wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes. 12:21 [hgb] 于 是 ， 摩 西 召 了 以 色 列 的 众 长 老 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 按 着 家 口 取 出 羊 羔 ， 把 这 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 宰 了 。 [kjv] Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. [bbe] Then Moses sent for the chiefs of Israel, and said to them, See that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families, and let the Passover lamb be put to death. 12:22 [hgb] 拿 一 把 牛 膝 草 ， 蘸 盆 里 的 血 ， 打 在 门 楣 上 和 左 右 的 门 框 上 。 你 们 谁 也 不 可 出 自 己 的 房 门 ， 直 到 早 晨 。 [kjv] And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. [bbe] And take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin, touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin; and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning. 12:23 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 要 巡 行 击 杀 埃 及 人 ， 他 看 见 血 在 门 楣 上 和 左 右 的 门 框 上 ， 就 必 越 过 那 门 ， 不 容 灭 命 的 进 你 们 的 房 屋 ， 击 杀 你 们 。 [kjv] For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. [bbe] For the Lord will go through the land, sending death on the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door, the Lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction. 12:24 [hgb] 这 例 ， 你 们 要 守 着 ， 作 为 你 们 和 你 们 子 孙 永 远 的 定 例 。 [kjv] And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. [bbe] And you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever. 12:25 [hgb] 日 后 ， 你 们 到 了 耶 和 华 按 着 所 应 许 赐 给 你 们 的 那 地 ， 就 要 守 这 礼 。 [kjv] And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. [bbe] And when you come into the land which the Lord will make yours, as he gave his word, you are to keep this act of worship. 12:26 [hgb] 你 们 的 儿 女 问 你 们 说 ， 行 这 礼 是 什 么 意 思 ？ [kjv] And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? [bbe] And when your children say to you, What is the reason of this act of worship? 12:27 [hgb] 你 们 就 说 ， 这 是 献 给 耶 和 华 逾 越 节 的 祭 。 当 以 色 列 人 在 埃 及 的 时 候 ， 他 击 杀 埃 及 人 ， 越 过 以 色 列 人 的 房 屋 ， 救 了 我 们 各 家 。 于 是 百 姓 低 头 下 拜 。 [kjv] That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD\u0027s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. [bbe] Then you will say, This is the offering of the Lord\u0027s Passover; for he went over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he sent death on the Egyptians, and kept our families safe. And the people gave worship with bent heads. 12:28 [hgb] 耶 和 华 怎 样 吩 咐 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 以 色 列 人 就 怎 样 行 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. [bbe] And the children of Israel went and did so; as the Lord had given orders to Moses and Aaron, so they did. 12:29 [hgb] 到 了 半 夜 ， 耶 和 华 把 埃 及 地 所 有 的 长 子 ， 就 是 从 坐 宝 座 的 法 老 ， 直 到 被 掳 囚 在 监 里 之 人 的 长 子 ， 以 及 一 切 头 生 的 牲 畜 ， 尽 都 杀 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. [bbe] And in the middle of the night the Lord sent death on every first male child in the land of Egypt, from the child of Pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison; and the first births of all the cattle. 12:30 [hgb] 法 老 和 一 切 臣 仆 ， 并 埃 及 众 人 ， 夜 间 都 起 来 了 。 在 埃 及 有 大 哀 号 ， 无 一 家 不 死 一 个 人 的 。 [kjv] And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. [bbe] Then Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and a great cry went up from Egypt; for there was not a house where someone was not dead. 12:31 [hgb] 夜 间 ， 法 老 召 了 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 来 ， 说 ， 起 来 ， 连 你 们 带 以 色 列 人 ， 从 我 民 中 出 去 ， 依 你 们 所 说 的 ， 去 事 奉 耶 和 华 吧 。 [kjv] And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. [bbe] And he sent for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Get up and go out from among my people, you and the children of Israel; go and give worship to the Lord as you have said. 12:32 [hgb] 也 依 你 们 所 说 的 ， 连 羊 群 牛 群 带 着 走 吧 ， 并 要 为 我 祝 福 。 [kjv] Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. [bbe] And take your flocks and your herds as you have said, and be gone; and give me your blessing. 12:33 [hgb] 埃 及 人 催 促 百 姓 ， 打 发 他 们 快 快 出 离 那 地 ， 因 为 埃 及 人 说 ， 我 们 都 要 死 了 。 [kjv] And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. [bbe] And the Egyptians were forcing the people on, to get them out of the land quickly; for they said, We are all dead men. 12:34 [hgb] 百 姓 就 拿 着 没 有 酵 的 生 面 ， 把 抟 面 盆 包 在 衣 服 中 ， 扛 在 肩 头 上 。 [kjv] And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. [bbe] And the people took their bread-paste before it was leavened, putting their basins in their clothing on their backs. 12:35 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 照 着 摩 西 的 话 行 ， 向 埃 及 人 要 金 器 ， 银 器 ， 和 衣 裳 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: [bbe] And the children of Israel had done as Moses had said; and they got from the Egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold, and clothing: 12:36 [hgb] 耶 和 华 叫 百 姓 在 埃 及 人 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 以 致 埃 及 人 给 他 们 所 要 的 。 他 们 就 把 埃 及 人 的 财 物 夺 去 了 。 [kjv] And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. [bbe] And the Lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested. So they took away all their goods from the Egyptians. 12:37 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 从 兰 塞 起 行 ， 往 疏 割 去 ， 除 了 妇 人 孩 子 ， 步 行 的 男 人 约 有 六 十 万 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. [bbe] And the children of Israel made the journey from Rameses to Succoth; there were about six hundred thousand men on foot, as well as children. 12:38 [hgb] 又 有 许 多 闲 杂 人 ， 并 有 羊 群 牛 群 ， 和 他 们 一 同 上 去 。 [kjv] And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. [bbe] And a mixed band of people went with them; and flocks and herds in great numbers. 12:39 [hgb] 他 们 用 埃 及 带 出 来 的 生 面 烤 成 无 酵 饼 。 这 生 面 原 没 有 发 起 ， 因 为 他 们 被 催 逼 离 开 埃 及 ， 不 能 耽 延 ， 也 没 有 为 自 己 预 备 什 么 食 物 。 [kjv] And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. [bbe] And they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of Egypt; it was not leavened, for they had been sent out of Egypt so quickly, that they had no time to make any food ready. 12:40 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 住 在 埃 及 共 有 四 百 三 十 年 。 [kjv] Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. [bbe] Now the children of Israel had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years. 12:41 [hgb] 正 满 了 四 百 三 十 年 的 那 一 天 ， 耶 和 华 的 军 队 都 从 埃 及 地 出 来 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. [bbe] And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the armies of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt. 12:42 [hgb] 这 夜 是 耶 和 华 的 夜 ， 因 耶 和 华 领 他 们 出 了 埃 及 地 ， 所 以 当 向 耶 和 华 谨 守 ， 是 以 色 列 众 人 世 世 代 代 该 谨 守 的 。 [kjv] It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. [bbe] It is a watch-night before the Lord who took them out of the land of Egypt: this same night is a watch-night to the Lord for all the children of Israel, through all their generations. 12:43 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ， 逾 越 节 的 例 是 这 样 ， 外 邦 人 都 不 可 吃 这 羊 羔 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the Passover: no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it: 12:44 [hgb] 但 各 人 用 银 子 买 的 奴 仆 ， 既 受 了 割 礼 就 可 以 吃 。 [kjv] But every man\u0027s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. [bbe] But every man\u0027s servant, whom he has got for money, may take of it, when he has had circumcision. 12:45 [hgb] 寄 居 的 和 雇 工 人 都 不 可 吃 。 [kjv] A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. [bbe] A man from a strange country living among you, and a servant working for payment, may not take part in it. 12:46 [hgb] 应 当 在 一 个 房 子 里 吃 ， 不 可 把 一 点 肉 从 房 子 里 带 到 外 头 去 。 羊 羔 的 骨 头 一 根 也 不 可 折 断 。 [kjv] In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. [bbe] It is to be taken in one house; not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house, and no bone of it may be broken. 12:47 [hgb] 以 色 列 全 会 众 都 要 守 这 礼 。 [kjv] All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. [bbe] All Israel is to keep the feast. 12:48 [hgb] 若 有 外 人 寄 居 在 你 们 中 间 ， 愿 向 耶 和 华 守 逾 越 节 ， 他 所 有 的 男 子 务 要 受 割 礼 ， 然 后 才 容 他 前 来 遵 守 ， 他 也 就 像 本 地 人 一 样 ， 但 未 受 割 礼 的 ， 都 不 可 吃 这 羊 羔 。 [kjv] And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. [bbe] And if a man from another country is living with you, and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all the males of his family undergo circumcision, and then let him come near and keep it; for he will then be as one of your people; but no one without circumcision may keep it. 12:49 [hgb] 本 地 人 和 寄 居 在 你 们 中 间 的 外 人 同 归 一 例 。 [kjv] One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. [bbe] The law is the same for him who is an Israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you. 12:50 [hgb] 耶 和 华 怎 样 吩 咐 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 以 色 列 众 人 就 怎 样 行 了 。 [kjv] Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. [bbe] So the children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses and Aaron. 12:51 [hgb] 正 当 那 日 ， 耶 和 华 将 以 色 列 人 按 着 他 们 的 军 队 ， 从 埃 及 地 领 出 来 。 [kjv] And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. [bbe] And on that very day the Lord took the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/406.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
