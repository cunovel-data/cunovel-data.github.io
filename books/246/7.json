as the LORD had said. \\n\\n [bbe] But Pharaoh\u0027s heart was made hard, and he did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 法 老 心 里 固 执 ， 不 肯 容 百 姓 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh\u0027s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh\u0027s heart is unchanged; he will not let the people go. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 明 日 早 晨 ， 他 出 来 往 水 边 去 ， 你 要 往 河 边 迎 接 他 ， 手 里 要 拿 着 那 变 过 蛇 的 杖 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river\u0027s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. \\n\\n [bbe] Go to Pharaoh in the morning; when he goes out to the water, you will be waiting for him by the edge of the Nile, with the rod which was turned into a snake in your hand; \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 希 伯 来 人 的 神 打 发 我 来 见 你 ， 说 ， 容 我 的 百 姓 去 ， 好 在 旷 野 事 奉 我 。 到 如 今 你 还 是 不 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. \\n\\n [bbe] And say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go so that they may give me worship in the waste land; but up to now you have not given ear to his words. \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 这 样 说 ， 我 要 用 我 手 里 的 杖 击 打 河 中 的 水 ， 水 就 变 作 血 ， 因 此 ， 你 必 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. \\n\\n [bbe] So the Lord says, By this you may be certain that I am the Lord; see, by the touch of this rod in my hand the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood; \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 河 里 的 鱼 必 死 ， 河 也 要 腥 臭 ， 埃 及 人 就 要 厌 恶 吃 这 河 里 的 水 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. \\n\\n [bbe] And the fish in the Nile will come to destruction, and the river will send up a bad smell, and the Egyptians will not be able, for disgust, to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， 你 对 亚 伦 说 ， 把 你 的 杖 伸 在 埃 及 所 有 的 水 以 上 ， 就 是 在 他 们 的 江 ， 河 ， 池 ， 塘 以 上 ， 叫 水 都 变 作 血 。 在 埃 及 遍 地 ， 无 论 在 木 器 中 ， 石 器 中 ， 都 必 有 血 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said, Say to Aaron, Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the waters of Egypt, and over the rivers and the streams and the pools, and over every stretch of water, so that they may be turned to blood; and there will be blood through all the land of Egypt, in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 就 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 行 。 亚 伦 在 法 老 和 臣 仆 眼 前 举 杖 击 打 河 里 的 水 ， 河 里 的 水 都 变 作 血 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had said; and when his rod had been lifted up and stretched out over the waters of the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, all the water in the Nile was turned to blood; \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 河 里 的 鱼 死 了 ， 河 也 腥 臭 了 ， 埃 及 人 就 不 能 吃 这 河 里 的 水 ， 埃 及 遍 地 都 有 了 血 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. \\n\\n [bbe] And the fish in the Nile came to destruction, and a bad smell went up from the river, and the Egyptians were not able to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking; and there was blood through all the land of Egypt. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 埃 及 行 法 术 的 ， 也 用 邪 术 照 样 而 行 。 法 老 心 里 刚 硬 ， 不 肯 听 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh\u0027s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. \\n\\n [bbe] And the wonder-workers of Egypt did the same with their secret arts: but Pharaoh\u0027s heart was made hard, and he would not give ear to them, as the Lord had said. \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 法 老 转 身 进 宫 ， 也 不 把 这 事 放 在 心 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Pharaoh went into his house, and did not take even this to heart. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 埃 及 人 都 在 河 的 两 边 挖 地 ， 要 得 水 喝 ， 因 为 他 们 不 能 喝 这 河 里 的 水 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the Egyptians made holes round about the Nile to get drinking-water, for they were not able to make use of the Nile water. \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 击 打 河 以 后 满 了 七 天 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. \\n\\n [bbe] And seven days went past, after the Lord had put his hand on the Nile. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/401.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;
