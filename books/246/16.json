\n [bbe] And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord; for your angry words against the Lord have come to his ears: and what are we that you are crying out against us? \n 16:8 [hgb] 摩 西 又 说 ， 耶 和 华 晚 上 必 给 你 们 肉 吃 ， 早 晨 必 给 你 们 食 物 得 饱 ， 因 为 你 们 向 耶 和 华 发 的 怨 言 ， 他 都 听 见 了 。 我 们 算 什 么 ， 你 们 的 怨 言 不 是 向 我 们 发 的 ， 乃 是 向 耶 和 华 发 的 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. \n [bbe] And Moses said, The Lord will give you meat for your food at evening, and in the morning bread in full measure; for your outcry against the Lord has come to his ears: for what are we? your outcry is not against us but against the Lord. \n 16:9 [hgb] 摩 西 对 亚 伦 说 ， 你 告 诉 以 色 列 全 会 众 说 ， 你 们 就 近 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 因 为 他 已 经 听 见 你 们 的 怨 言 了 。 \n [kjv] And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. \n [bbe] And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the people of Israel, Come near before the Lord for he has given ear to your outcry. \n 16:10 [hgb] 亚 伦 正 对 以 色 列 全 会 众 说 话 的 时 候 ， 他 们 向 旷 野 观 看 ， 不 料 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 在 云 中 显 现 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. \n [bbe] And while Aaron was talking to the children of Israel, their eyes were turned in the direction of the waste land, and they saw the glory of the Lord shining in the cloud. \n 16:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \n 16:12 [hgb] 我 已 经 听 见 以 色 列 人 的 怨 言 。 你 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 到 黄 昏 的 时 候 ， 你 们 要 吃 肉 ， 早 晨 必 有 食 物 得 饱 ， 你 们 就 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. \n [bbe] The outcry of the children of Israel has come to my ears: say to them now, At nightfall you will have meat for your food, and in the morning bread in full measure; and you will see that I am the Lord your God. \n 16:13 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 有 鹌 鹑 飞 来 ， 遮 满 了 营 ， 早 晨 在 营 四 围 的 地 上 有 露 水 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. \n [bbe] And it came about that in the evening little birds came up and the place was covered with them: and in the morning there was dew all round about the tents. \n 16:14 [hgb] 露 水 上 升 之 后 ， 不 料 ， 野 地 面 上 有 如 白 霜 的 小 圆 物 。 \n [kjv] And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. \n [bbe] And when the dew was gone, on the face of the earth was a small round thing, like small drops of ice on the earth. \n 16:15 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 看 见 ， 不 知 道 是 什 么 ， 就 彼 此 对 问 说 ， 这 是 什 么 呢 ？ 摩 西 对 他 们 说 ， 这 就 是 耶 和 华 给 你 们 吃 的 食 物 。 \n [kjv] And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. \n [bbe] And when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, What is it? for they had no idea what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which the Lord has given you for your food. \n 16:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 是 这 样 ， 你 们 要 按 着 各 人 的 饭 量 ， 为 帐 棚 里 的 人 ， 按 着 人 数 收 起 来 ， 各 拿 一 俄 梅 珥 。 \n [kjv] This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord has said, Let every man take up as much as he has need of; at the rate of one omer for every person, let every man take as much as is needed for his family. \n 16:17 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 就 这 样 行 ， 有 多 收 的 ， 有 少 收 的 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel did so, and some took more and some less. \n 16:18 [hgb] 及 至 用 俄 梅 珥 量 一 量 ， 多 收 的 也 没 有 余 ， 少 收 的 也 没 有 缺 ， 各 人 按 着 自 己 的 饭 量 收 取 。 \n [kjv] And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. \n [bbe] And when it was measured, he who had taken up much had nothing over, and he who had little had enough; every man had taken what he was able to make use of. \n 16:19 [hgb] 摩 西 对 他 们 说 ， 所 收 的 ， 不 许 什 么 人 留 到 早 晨 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. \n [bbe] And Moses said to them, Let nothing be kept till the morning. \n 16:20 [hgb] 然 而 他 们 不 听 摩 西 的 话 ， 内 中 有 留 到 早 晨 的 ， 就 生 虫 变 臭 了 ， 摩 西 便 向 他 们 发 怒 。 \n [kjv] Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. \n [bbe] But they gave no attention to Moses, and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell: and Moses was angry with them. \n 16:21 [hgb] 他 们 每 日 早 晨 ， 按 着 各 人 的 饭 量 收 取 ， 日 头 一 发 热 ， 就 消 化 了 。 \n [kjv] And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. \n [bbe] And they took it up morning by morning, every man as he had need: and when the sun was high it was gone. \n 16:22 [hgb] 到 第 六 天 ， 他 们 收 了 双 倍 的 食 物 ， 每 人 两 俄 梅 珥 。 会 众 的 官 长 来 告 诉 摩 西 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. \n [bbe] And on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread, two omers for every person: and all the rulers of the people gave Moses word of it. \n 16:23 [hgb] 摩 西 对 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 这 样 说 ， 明 天 是 圣 安 息 日 ， 是 向 耶 和 华 守 的 圣 安 息 日 。 你 们 要 烤 的 就 烤 了 ， 要 煮 的 就 煮 了 ， 所 剩 下 的 都 留 到 早 晨 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. \n [bbe] And he said, This is what the Lord has said, Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord: what has to be cooked may be cooked; and what is over, put on one side to be kept till the morning. \n 16:24 [hgb] 他 们 就 照 摩 西 的 吩 咐 留 到 早 晨 ， 也 不 臭 ， 里 头 也 没 有 虫 子 。 \n [kjv] And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. \n [bbe] And they kept it till the morning as Moses had said: and no smell came from it, and it had no worms. \n 16:25 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 你 们 今 天 吃 这 个 吧 ， 因 为 今 天 是 向 耶 和 华 守 的 安 息 日 ， 你 们 在 田 野 必 找 不 着 了 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. \n [bbe] And Moses said, Make your meal today of what you have, for this day is a Sabbath to the Lord: today you will not get any in the fields. \n 16:26 [hgb] 六 天 可 以 收 取 ， 第 七 天 乃 是 安 息 日 ， 那 一 天 必 没 有 了 。 \n [kjv] Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. \n [bbe] For six days you will get it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any. \n 16:27 [hgb] 第 七 天 ， 百 姓 中 有 人 出 去 收 ， 什 么 也 找 不 着 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. \n [bbe] But still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it, and there was not any. \n 16:28 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 们 不 肯 守 我 的 诫 命 和 律 法 ， 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, How long will you go against my orders and my laws? \n 16:29 [hgb] 你 们 看 ， 耶 和 华 既 将 安 息 日 赐 给 你 们 ， 所 以 第 六 天 他 赐 给 你 们 两 天 的 食 物 ， 第 七 天 各 人 要 住 在 自 己 的 地 方 ， 不 许 什 么 人 出 去 。 \n [kjv] See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. \n [bbe] See, because the Lord has given you the Sabbath, he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days; let every man keep where he is; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. \n 16:30 [hgb] 于 是 百 姓 第 七 天 安 息 了 。 \n [kjv] So the people rested on the seventh day. \n [bbe] So the people took their rest on the seventh day. \n 16:31 [hgb] 这 食 物 ， 以 色 列 家 叫 吗 哪 ， 样 子 像 芫 荽 子 ， 颜 色 是 白 的 ， 滋 味 如 同 搀 蜜 的 薄 饼 。 \n [kjv] And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. \n [bbe] And this bread was named manna by Israel: it was white, like a grain seed, and its taste was like cakes made with honey. \n 16:32 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 是 这 样 ， 要 将 一 满 俄 梅 珥 吗 哪 留 到 世 世 代 代 ， 使 后 人 可 以 看 见 我 当 日 将 你 们 领 出 埃 及 地 ， 在 旷 野 所 给 你 们 吃 的 食 物 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. \n [bbe] And Moses said, This is the order which the Lord has given: Let one omer of it be kept for future generations, so that they may see the bread which I gave you for your food in the waste land, when I took you out from the land of Egypt. \n 16:33 [hgb] 摩 西 对 亚 伦 说 ， 你 拿 一 个 罐 子 ， 盛 一 满 俄 梅 珥 吗 哪 ， 存 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 要 留 到 世 世 代 代 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. \n [bbe] And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put one omer of manna in it, and put it away before the Lord, to be kept for future generations. \n 16:34 [hgb] 耶 和 华 怎 么 吩 咐 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 就 怎 么 行 ， 把 吗 哪 放 在 法 柜 前 存 留 。 \n [kjv] As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. \n [bbe] So Aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept, as the Lord gave orders to Moses. \n 16:35 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 吃 吗 哪 共 四 十 年 ， 直 到 进 了 有 人 居 住 之 地 ， 就 是 迦 南 的 境 界 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel had manna for their food for forty years, till they came to a land with people in it, till they came to the edge of the land of Canaan. \n 16:36 [hgb] （ 俄 梅 珥 乃 伊 法 十 分 之 一 ） 。 \n [kjv] Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. \n [bbe] Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/410.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
