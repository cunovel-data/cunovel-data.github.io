who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? \\n\\n [bbe] Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods? who is like you, in holy glory, to be praised with fear, doing wonders? \\n\\n 15:12 [hgb] 你 伸 出 右 手 ， 地 便 吞 灭 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. \\n\\n [bbe] When your right hand was stretched out, the mouth of the earth was open for them. \\n\\n 15:13 [hgb] 你 凭 慈 爱 ， 领 了 你 所 赎 的 百 姓 ， 你 凭 能 力 ， 引 他 们 到 了 你 的 圣 所 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. \\n\\n [bbe] In your mercy you went before the people whom you have made yours; guiding them in your strength to your holy place. \\n\\n 15:14 [hgb] 外 邦 人 听 见 就 发 颤 ， 疼 痛 抓 住 非 利 士 的 居 民 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. \\n\\n [bbe] Hearing of you the peoples were shaking in fear: the people of Philistia were gripped with pain. \\n\\n 15:15 [hgb] 那 时 ， 以 东 的 族 长 惊 惶 ， 摩 押 的 英 雄 被 战 兢 抓 住 ， 迦 南 的 居 民 心 都 消 化 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. \\n\\n [bbe] The chiefs of Edom were troubled in heart; the strong men of Moab were in the grip of fear: all the people of Canaan became like water. \\n\\n 15:16 [hgb] 惊 骇 恐 惧 临 到 他 们 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 因 你 膀 臂 的 大 能 ， 他 们 如 石 头 寂 然 不 动 ， 等 候 你 的 百 姓 过 去 ， 等 候 你 所 赎 的 百 姓 过 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. \\n\\n [bbe] Fear and grief came on them; by the strength of your arm they were turned to stone; till your people went over, O Lord, till the people went over whom you have made yours. \\n\\n 15:17 [hgb] 你 要 将 他 们 领 进 去 ， 栽 于 你 产 业 的 山 上 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 就 是 你 为 自 己 所 造 的 住 处 ， 主 阿 ， 就 是 你 手 所 建 立 的 圣 所 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established. \\n\\n [bbe] You will take them in, planting them in the mountain of your heritage, the place, O Lord, where you have made your house, the holy place, O Lord, the building of your hands. \\n\\n 15:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 作 王 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. \\n\\n [bbe] The Lord is King for ever and ever. \\n\\n 15:19 [hgb] 法 老 的 马 匹 ， 车 辆 ， 和 马 兵 下 到 海 中 ， 耶 和 华 使 海 水 回 流 ， 淹 没 他 们 ， 惟 有 以 色 列 人 在 海 中 走 干 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. \\n\\n [bbe] For the horses of Pharaoh, with his war-carriages and his horsemen, went into the sea, and the Lord sent the waters of the sea back over them; but the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land. \\n\\n 15:20 [hgb] 亚 伦 的 姐 姐 ， 女 先 知 米 利 暗 ， 手 里 拿 着 鼓 ， 众 妇 女 也 跟 她 出 去 拿 鼓 跳 舞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. \\n\\n [bbe] And Miriam, the woman prophet, the sister of Aaron, took an instrument of music in her hand; and all the women went after her with music and dances. \\n\\n 15:21 [hgb] 米 利 暗 应 声 说 ， 你 们 要 歌 颂 耶 和 华 ， 因 他 大 大 战 胜 ， 将 马 和 骑 马 的 投 在 海 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. \\n\\n [bbe] And Miriam, answering, said, Make a song to the Lord, for he is lifted up in glory; the horse and the horseman he has sent into the sea. \\n\\n 15:22 [hgb] 摩 西 领 以 色 列 人 从 红 海 往 前 行 ， 到 了 书 珥 的 旷 野 ， 在 旷 野 走 了 三 天 ， 找 不 着 水 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Moses took Israel forward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the waste land of Shur; and for three days they were in the waste land where there was no water. \\n\\n 15:23 [hgb] 到 了 玛 拉 ， 不 能 喝 那 里 的 水 ， 因 为 水 苦 ， 所 以 那 地 名 叫 玛 拉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they came to Marah, the water was no good for drinking, for the waters of Marah were bitter, which is why it was named Marah. \\n\\n 15:24 [hgb] 百 姓 就 向 摩 西 发 怨 言 ， 说 ， 我 们 喝 什 么 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? \\n\\n [bbe] And the people, crying out against Moses, said, What are we to have for drink? \\n\\n 15:25 [hgb] 摩 西 呼 求 耶 和 华 ， 耶 和 华 指 示 他 一 棵 树 。 他 把 树 丢 在 水 里 ， 水 就 变 甜 了 。 耶 和 华 在 那 里 为 他 们 定 了 律 例 ， 典 章 ， 在 那 里 试 验 他 们 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, \\n\\n [bbe] And in answer to his prayer, the Lord made him see a tree, and when he put it into the water, the water was made sweet. There he gave them a law and an order, testing them; \\n\\n 15:26 [hgb] 又 说 ， 你 若 留 意 听 耶 和 华 你 神 的 话 ， 又 行 我 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 留 心 听 我 的 诫 命 ， 守 我 一 切 的 律 例 ， 我 就 不 将 所 加 与 埃 及 人 的 疾 病 加 在 你 身 上 ， 因 为 我 耶 和 华 是 医 治 你 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, If with all your heart you will give attention to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is right in his eyes, giving ear to his orders and keeping his laws, I will not put on you any of the diseases which I put on the Egyptians: for I am the Lord your life-giver. \\n\\n 15:27 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 以 琳 ， 在 那 里 有 十 二 股 水 泉 ， 七 十 棵 棕 树 ， 他 们 就 在 那 里 的 水 边 安 营 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. \\n\\n [bbe] And they came to Elim where there were twelve water-springs and seventy palm-trees: and they put up their tents there by the waters. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/409.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
