{"id":7533,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"17:1 [hgb] 以 色 列 全 会 众 都 遵 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 ， 按 着 站 口 从 汛 的 旷 野 往 前 行 ， 在 利 非 订 安 营 。 百 姓 没 有 水 喝 ， \n [kjv] And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel went on from the waste land of Sin, by stages as the Lord gave them orders, and put up their tents in Rephidim: and there was no drinking-water for the people. \n 17:2 [hgb] 所 以 与 摩 西 争 闹 ， 说 ， 给 我 们 水 喝 吧 。 摩 西 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 与 我 争 闹 ？ 为 什 么 试 探 耶 和 华 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? \n [bbe] So the people were angry with Moses, and said, Give us water for drinking. And Moses said, Why are you angry with me? and why do you put God to the test? \n 17:3 [hgb] 百 姓 在 那 里 甚 渴 ， 要 喝 水 ， 就 向 摩 西 发 怨 言 ， 说 ， 你 为 什 么 将 我 们 从 埃 及 领 出 来 ， 使 我 们 和 我 们 的 儿 女 并 牲 畜 都 渴 死 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? \n [bbe] And the people were in great need of water; and they made an outcry against Moses, and said, Why have you taken us out of Egypt to send death on us and our children and our cattle through need of water? \n 17:4 [hgb] 摩 西 就 呼 求 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 向 这 百 姓 怎 样 行 呢 ？ 他 们 几 乎 要 拿 石 头 打 死 我 。 \n [kjv] And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. \n [bbe] And Moses, crying out to the Lord, said, What am I to do to this people? they are almost ready to put me to death by stoning. \n 17:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 手 里 拿 着 你 先 前 击 打 河 水 的 杖 ， 带 领 以 色 列 的 几 个 长 老 ， 从 百 姓 面 前 走 过 去 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take some of the chiefs of Israel with you, and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the Nile, and go. \n 17:6 [hgb] 我 必 在 何 烈 的 磐 石 那 里 ， 站 在 你 面 前 。 你 要 击 打 磐 石 ， 从 磐 石 里 必 有 水 流 出 来 ， 使 百 姓 可 以 喝 。 摩 西 就 在 以 色 列 的 长 老 眼 前 这 样 行 了 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. \n [bbe] See, I will take my place before you on the rock in Horeb; and when you give the rock a blow, water will come out of it, and the people will have drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the chiefs of Israel. \n 17:7 [hgb] 他 给 那 地 方 起 名 叫 玛 撒 （ 就 是 试 探 的 意 思 ） ， 又 叫 米 利 巴 （ 就 是 争 闹 的 意 思 ） ， 因 以 色 列 人 争 闹 ， 又 因 他 们 试 探 耶 和 华 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 在 我 们 中 间 不 是 。 \n [kjv] And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? \n [bbe] And he gave that place the name Massah and Meribah, because the children of Israel were angry, and because they put the Lord to the test, saying, Is the Lord with us or not? \n 17:8 [hgb] 那 时 ， 亚 玛 力 人 来 在 利 非 订 ， 和 以 色 列 人 争 战 。 \n [kjv] Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. \n [bbe] Then Amalek came and made war on Israel in Rephidim. \n 17:9 [hgb] 摩 西 对 约 书 亚 说 ， 你 为 我 们 选 出 人 来 ， 出 去 和 亚 玛 力 人 争 战 。 明 天 我 手 里 要 拿 着 神 的 杖 ， 站 在 山 顶 上 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. \n [bbe] And Moses said to Joshua, Get together a band of men for us and go out, make war on Amalek: tomorrow I will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand. \n 17:10 [hgb] 于 是 约 书 亚 照 着 摩 西 对 他 所 说 的 话 行 ， 和 亚 玛 力 人 争 战 。 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 与 户 珥 都 上 了 山 顶 。 \n [kjv] So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. \n [bbe] So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and went to war with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. \n 17:11 [hgb] 摩 西 何 时 举 手 ， 以 色 列 人 就 得 胜 ， 何 时 垂 手 ， 亚 玛 力 人 就 得 胜 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. \n [bbe] Now while Moses\u0027 hand was lifted up, Israel was the stronger: but when he let his hand go down, Amalek became the stronger. \n 17:12 [hgb] 但 摩 西 的 手 发 沉 ， 他 们 就 搬 石 头 来 ， 放 在 他 以 下 ， 他 就 坐 在 上 面 。 亚 伦 与 户 珥 扶 着 他 的 手 ， 一 个 在 这 边 ， 一 个 在 那 边 ， 他 的 手 就 稳 住 ， 直 到 日 落 的 时 候 。 \n [kjv] But Moses\u0027 hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. \n [bbe] But Moses\u0027 hands became tired; so they put a stone under him and he took his seat on it, Aaron and Hur supporting his hands, one on one side and one on the other; so his hands were kept up without falling till the sun went down. \n 17:13 [hgb] 约 书 亚 用 刀 杀 了 亚 玛 力 王 和 他 的 百 姓 。 \n [kjv] And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. \n [bbe] And Joshua overcame Amalek and his people with the sword. \n 17:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 我 要 将 亚 玛 力 的 名 号 从 天 下 全 然 涂 抹 了 ， 你 要 将 这 话 写 在 书 上 作 纪 念 ， 又 念 给 约 书 亚 听 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Make a record of this in a book, so that it may be kept in memory, and say it again in the ears of Joshua: that all memory of Amalek is to be completely uprooted from the earth. \n 17:15 [hgb] 摩 西 筑 了 一 座 坛 ， 起 名 叫 耶 和 华 尼 西 （ 就 是 耶 和 华 是 我 旌 旗 的 意 思 ） ， \n [kjv] And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: \n [bbe] Then Moses put up an altar and gave it the name of Yahweh-nissi: \n 17:16 [hgb] 又 说 ， 耶 和 华 已 经 起 了 誓 ， 必 世 世 代 代 和 亚 玛 力 人 争 战 。 \n [kjv] For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. \n [bbe] For he said, The Lord has taken his oath that there will be war with Amalek from generation to generation. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/411.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
