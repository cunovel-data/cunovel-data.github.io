{"id":7526,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 进 去 见 法 老 。 我 使 他 和 他 臣 仆 的 心 刚 硬 ， 为 要 在 他 们 中 间 显 我 这 些 神 迹 ， [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have made his heart and the hearts of his servants hard, so that I may let my signs be seen among them: 10:2 [hgb] 并 要 叫 你 将 我 向 埃 及 人 所 作 的 事 ， 和 在 他 们 中 间 所 行 的 神 迹 ， 传 于 你 儿 子 和 你 孙 子 的 耳 中 ， 好 叫 你 们 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son\u0027s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD. [bbe] And so that you may be able to give to your son and to your son\u0027s son the story of my wonders in Egypt, and the signs which I have done among them; so that you may see that I am the Lord. 10:3 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 就 进 去 见 法 老 ， 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 希 伯 来 人 的 神 这 样 说 ， 你 在 我 面 前 不 肯 自 卑 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 容 我 的 百 姓 去 ， 好 事 奉 我 。 [kjv] And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. [bbe] Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: How long will you be lifted up in your pride before me? let my people go so that they may give me worship. 10:4 [hgb] 你 若 不 肯 容 我 的 百 姓 去 ， 明 天 我 要 使 蝗 虫 进 入 你 的 境 内 ， [kjv] Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: [bbe] For if you will not let my people go, tomorrow I will send locusts into your land: 10:5 [hgb] 遮 满 地 面 ， 甚 至 看 不 见 地 ， 并 且 吃 那 冰 雹 所 剩 的 和 田 间 所 长 的 一 切 树 木 。 [kjv] And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: [bbe] And the face of the earth will be covered with them, so that you will not be able to see the earth: and they will be the destruction of everything which up to now has not been damaged, everything which was not crushed by the ice-storm, and every tree still living in your fields. 10:6 [hgb] 你 的 宫 殿 和 你 众 臣 仆 的 房 屋 ， 并 一 切 埃 及 人 的 房 屋 ， 都 要 被 蝗 虫 占 满 了 ， 自 从 你 祖 宗 和 你 祖 宗 的 祖 宗 在 世 以 来 ， 直 到 今 日 ， 没 有 见 过 这 样 的 灾 。 摩 西 就 转 身 离 开 法 老 出 去 。 [kjv] And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers\u0027 fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. [bbe] And your houses will be full of them, and the houses of your servants and of all the Egyptians; it will be worse than anything your fathers have seen or their fathers, from the day when they were living on the earth till this day. And so he went out from Pharaoh. 10:7 [hgb] 法 老 的 臣 仆 对 法 老 说 ， 这 人 为 我 们 的 网 罗 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 容 这 些 人 去 事 奉 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 吧 ， 埃 及 已 经 败 坏 了 ， 你 还 不 知 道 吗 ？ [kjv] And Pharaoh\u0027s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? [bbe] And Pharaoh\u0027s servants said to him, How long is this man to be the cause of evil to us? let the men go so that they may give worship to the Lord their God: are you not awake to Egypt\u0027s danger? 10:8 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 被 召 回 来 见 法 老 ， 法 老 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 去 事 奉 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 但 那 要 去 的 是 谁 呢 ？ [kjv] And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go? [bbe] Then Moses and Aaron came in again before Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go and give worship to the Lord your God: but which of you are going? 10:9 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 我 们 要 和 我 们 老 的 少 的 ， 儿 子 女 儿 同 去 ， 且 把 羊 群 牛 群 一 同 带 去 ， 因 为 我 们 务 要 向 耶 和 华 守 节 。 [kjv] And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. [bbe] And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds; for we are to keep a feast to the Lord. 10:10 [hgb] 法 老 对 他 们 说 ， 我 容 你 们 和 你 们 妇 人 孩 子 去 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 与 你 们 同 在 吧 ， 你 们 要 谨 慎 ， 因 为 有 祸 在 你 们 眼 前 （ 或 作 你 们 存 着 恶 意 ） ， [kjv] And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. [bbe] And he said to them, May the Lord be with you, if I will let you and your little ones go! take care, for your purpose clearly is evil. 10:11 [hgb] 不 可 都 去 ， 你 们 这 壮 年 人 去 事 奉 耶 和 华 吧 ， 因 为 这 是 你 们 所 求 的 。 于 是 把 他 们 从 法 老 面 前 撵 出 去 。 [kjv] Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh\u0027s presence. [bbe] Not so; but let your males go and give worship to the Lord, as your desire is. This he said, driving them out from before him. 10:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 向 埃 及 地 伸 杖 ， 使 蝗 虫 到 埃 及 地 上 来 ， 吃 地 上 一 切 的 菜 蔬 ， 就 是 冰 雹 所 剩 的 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the land of Egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land, even everything untouched by the ice-storm. 10:13 [hgb] 摩 西 就 向 埃 及 地 伸 杖 ， 那 一 昼 一 夜 ， 耶 和 华 使 东 风 刮 在 埃 及 地 上 ， 到 了 早 晨 ， 东 风 把 蝗 虫 刮 了 来 。 [kjv] And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. [bbe] And Moses\u0027 rod was stretched out over the land of Egypt, and the Lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night; and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind. 10:14 [hgb] 蝗 虫 上 来 ， 落 在 埃 及 的 四 境 ， 甚 是 厉 害 ， 以 前 没 有 这 样 的 ， 以 后 也 必 没 有 。 [kjv] And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. [bbe] And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, resting on every part of the land, in very great numbers; such an army of locusts had never been seen before, and never will be again. 10:15 [hgb] 因 为 这 蝗 虫 遮 满 地 面 ， 甚 至 地 都 黑 暗 了 ， 又 吃 地 上 一 切 的 菜 蔬 和 冰 雹 所 剩 树 上 的 果 子 。 埃 及 遍 地 ， 无 论 是 树 木 ， 是 田 间 的 菜 蔬 ， 连 一 点 青 的 也 没 有 留 下 。 [kjv] For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. [bbe] For all the face of the earth was covered with them, so that the land was black; and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the ice-storm they took for food: not one green thing, no plant or tree, was to be seen in all the land of Egypt. 10:16 [hgb] 于 是 法 老 急 忙 召 了 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 来 ， 说 ， 我 得 罪 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 又 得 罪 了 你 们 。 [kjv] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. [bbe] Then Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and said, I have done evil against the Lord your God and against you. 10:17 [hgb] 现 在 求 你 ， 只 这 一 次 ， 饶 恕 我 的 罪 ， 求 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 使 我 脱 离 这 一 次 的 死 亡 。 [kjv] Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. [bbe] Let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only, and make prayer to the Lord your God that he will take away from me this death only. 10:18 [hgb] 摩 西 就 离 开 法 老 去 求 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. [bbe] So he went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord. 10:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 转 了 极 大 的 西 风 ， 把 蝗 虫 刮 起 ， 吹 入 红 海 ， 在 埃 及 的 四 境 连 一 个 也 没 有 留 下 。 [kjv] And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. [bbe] And the Lord sent a very strong west wind, which took up the locusts, driving them into the Red Sea; not one locust was to be seen in any part of Egypt. 10:20 [hgb] 但 耶 和 华 使 法 老 的 心 刚 硬 ， 不 容 以 色 列 人 去 。 [kjv] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\u0027s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. [bbe] But the Lord made Pharaoh\u0027s heart hard, and he did not let the children of Israel go. 10:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 向 天 伸 杖 ， 使 埃 及 地 黑 暗 ， 这 黑 暗 似 乎 摸 得 着 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out to heaven, and all the land of Egypt will be dark, so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark. 10:22 [hgb] 摩 西 向 天 伸 杖 ， 埃 及 遍 地 就 乌 黑 了 三 天 。 [kjv] And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: [bbe] And when Moses\u0027 hand was stretched out, dark night came over all the land of Egypt for three days; 10:23 [hgb] 三 天 之 久 ， 人 不 能 相 见 ， 谁 也 不 敢 起 来 离 开 本 处 ， 惟 有 以 色 列 人 家 中 都 有 亮 光 。 [kjv] They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. [bbe] They were not able to see one another, and no one got up from his place for three days: but where the children of Israel were living it was light. 10:24 [hgb] 法 老 就 召 摩 西 来 ， 说 ， 你 们 去 事 奉 耶 和 华 ， 只 是 你 们 的 羊 群 牛 群 要 留 下 ， 你 们 的 妇 人 孩 子 可 以 和 你 们 同 去 。 [kjv] And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. [bbe] Then Pharaoh sent for Moses, and said, Go and give worship to the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be kept here: your little ones may go with you. 10:25 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 你 总 要 把 祭 物 和 燔 祭 牲 交 给 我 们 ， 使 我 们 可 以 祭 祀 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 。 [kjv] And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. [bbe] But Moses said, You will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the Lord our God. 10:26 [hgb] 我 们 的 牲 畜 也 要 带 去 ， 连 一 蹄 也 不 留 下 ， 因 为 我 们 要 从 其 中 取 出 来 ， 事 奉 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 。 我 们 未 到 那 里 ， 还 不 知 道 用 什 么 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. [bbe] So our cattle will have to go with us, not one may be kept back; for they are needed for the worship of the Lord our God; we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place. 10:27 [hgb] 但 耶 和 华 使 法 老 的 心 刚 硬 ， 不 肯 容 他 们 去 。 [kjv] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\u0027s heart, and he would not let them go. [bbe] But the Lord made Pharaoh\u0027s heart hard, and he would not let them go. 10:28 [hgb] 法 老 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 离 开 我 去 吧 ， 你 要 小 心 ， 不 要 再 见 我 的 面 ， 因 为 你 见 我 面 的 那 日 你 就 必 死 。 [kjv] And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. [bbe] And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me, take care that you come not again before me; for the day when you see my face again will be your last. 10:29 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 你 说 得 好 ， 我 必 不 再 见 你 的 面 了 。 [kjv] And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. [bbe] And Moses said, You say truly; I will not see your face again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/404.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
