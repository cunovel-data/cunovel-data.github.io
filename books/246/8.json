[bbe] And this is what the Lord said to Moses: Go to Pharaoh and say to him, The Lord says, Let my people go so that they may give me worship. 8:2 [hgb] 你 若 不 肯 容 他 们 去 ， 我 必 使 青 蛙 糟 蹋 你 的 四 境 。 [kjv] And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: [bbe] And if you will not let them go, see, I will send frogs into every part of your land: 8:3 [hgb] 河 里 要 滋 生 青 蛙 ， 这 青 蛙 要 上 来 进 你 的 宫 殿 和 你 的 卧 房 ， 上 你 的 床 榻 ， 进 你 臣 仆 的 房 屋 ， 上 你 百 姓 的 身 上 ， 进 你 的 炉 灶 和 你 的 抟 面 盆 ， [kjv] And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: [bbe] The Nile will be full of frogs, and they will come up into your house and into your bedrooms and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and into your bread-basins. 8:4 [hgb] 又 要 上 你 和 你 百 姓 并 你 众 臣 仆 的 身 上 。 [kjv] And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. [bbe] The frogs will come up over you and your people and all your servants. 8:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， 你 对 亚 伦 说 ， 把 你 的 杖 伸 在 江 ， 河 ， 池 以 上 ， 使 青 蛙 到 埃 及 地 上 来 。 [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the streams and the waterways and the pools, causing frogs to come up on the land of Egypt. 8:6 [hgb] 亚 伦 便 伸 杖 在 埃 及 的 诸 水 以 上 ， 青 蛙 就 上 来 ， 遮 满 了 埃 及 地 。 [kjv] And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. [bbe] And when Aaron put out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs came up and all the land of Egypt was covered with them. 8:7 [hgb] 行 法 术 的 也 用 他 们 的 邪 术 照 样 而 行 ， 叫 青 蛙 上 了 埃 及 地 。 [kjv] And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. [bbe] And the wonder-workers did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up over the land of Egypt. 8:8 [hgb] 法 老 召 了 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 来 ， 说 ， 请 你 们 求 耶 和 华 使 这 青 蛙 离 开 我 和 我 的 民 ， 我 就 容 百 姓 去 祭 祀 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. [bbe] Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Make prayer to the Lord that he will take away these frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go and make their offering to the Lord. 8:9 [hgb] 摩 西 对 法 老 说 ， 任 凭 你 吧 ， 我 要 何 时 为 你 和 你 的 臣 仆 并 你 的 百 姓 祈 求 ， 除 灭 青 蛙 离 开 你 和 你 的 宫 殿 只 留 在 河 里 呢 ？ [kjv] And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? [bbe] And Moses said, I will let you have the honour of saying when I am to make prayer for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs may be sent away from you and your houses, and be only in the Nile. 8:10 [hgb] 他 说 ， 明 天 。 摩 西 说 ， 可 以 照 你 的 话 吧 ， 好 叫 你 知 道 没 有 像 耶 和 华 我 们 神 的 。 [kjv] And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. [bbe] And he said, By tomorrow. And he said, Let it be as you say: so that you may see that there is no other like the Lord our God. 8:11 [hgb] 青 蛙 要 离 开 你 和 你 的 宫 殿 ， 并 你 的 臣 仆 与 你 的 百 姓 ， 只 留 在 河 里 。 [kjv] And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. [bbe] And the frogs will be gone from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people and will be only in the Nile. 8:12 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 离 开 法 老 出 去 。 摩 西 为 扰 害 法 老 的 青 蛙 呼 求 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. [bbe] Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses made prayer to the Lord about the frogs which he had sent on Pharaoh. 8:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 就 照 摩 西 的 话 行 。 凡 在 房 里 ， 院 中 ， 田 间 的 青 蛙 都 死 了 。 [kjv] And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. [bbe] And the Lord did as Moses said; and there was an end of all the frogs in the houses and in the open spaces and in the fields. 8:14 [hgb] 众 人 把 青 蛙 聚 拢 成 堆 ， 遍 地 就 都 腥 臭 。 [kjv] And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. [bbe] And they put them together in masses, and a bad smell went up from the land. 8:15 [hgb] 但 法 老 见 灾 祸 松 缓 ， 就 硬 着 心 ， 不 肯 听 他 们 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 [kjv] But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. [bbe] But when Pharaoh saw that there was peace for a time, he made his heart hard and did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said. 8:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 吩 咐 摩 西 说 ， 你 对 亚 伦 说 ， 伸 出 你 的 杖 击 打 地 上 的 尘 土 ， 使 尘 土 在 埃 及 遍 地 变 作 虱 子 （ 或 作 虼 蚤 下 同 ） 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of Egypt. 8:17 [hgb] 他 们 就 这 样 行 。 亚 伦 伸 杖 击 打 地 上 的 尘 土 ， 就 在 人 身 上 和 牲 畜 身 上 有 了 虱 子 ， 埃 及 遍 地 的 尘 土 都 变 成 虱 子 了 。 [kjv] And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. [bbe] And they did so; and Aaron, stretching out the rod in his hand, gave a touch to the dust of the earth, and insects came on man and on beast; all the dust of the earth was changed into insects through all the land of Egypt. 8:18 [hgb] 行 法 术 的 也 用 邪 术 要 生 出 虱 子 来 ， 却 是 不 能 。 于 是 在 人 身 上 和 牲 畜 身 上 都 有 了 虱 子 。 [kjv] And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. [bbe] And the wonder-workers with their secret arts, attempting to make insects, were unable to do so: and there were insects on man and on beast. 8:19 [hgb] 行 法 术 的 就 对 法 老 说 ， 这 是 神 的 手 段 。 法 老 心 里 刚 硬 ， 不 肯 听 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 [kjv] Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh\u0027s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. [bbe] Then the wonder-workers said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: but Pharaoh\u0027s heart was hard, and he did not give ear to them, as the Lord had said. 8:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 清 早 起 来 ， 法 老 来 到 水 边 ， 你 站 在 他 面 前 ， 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 这 样 说 ， 容 我 的 百 姓 去 ， 好 事 奉 我 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Get up early in the morning and take your place before Pharaoh when he comes out to the water; and say to him, This is what the Lord says: Let my people go to give me worship. 8:21 [hgb] 你 若 不 容 我 的 百 姓 去 ， 我 要 叫 成 群 的 苍 蝇 到 你 和 你 臣 仆 并 你 百 姓 的 身 上 ， 进 你 的 房 屋 ， 并 且 埃 及 人 的 房 屋 和 他 们 所 住 的 地 都 要 满 了 成 群 的 苍 蝇 。 [kjv] Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. [bbe] For if you do not let my people go, see, I will send clouds of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into their houses; and the houses of the Egyptians and the land where they are will be full of flies. 8:22 [hgb] 当 那 日 ， 我 必 分 别 我 百 姓 所 住 的 歌 珊 地 ， 使 那 里 没 有 成 群 的 苍 蝇 ， 好 叫 你 知 道 我 是 天 下 的 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. [bbe] And at that time I will make a division between your land and the land of Goshen where my people are, and no flies will be there; so that you may see that I am the Lord over all the earth. 8:23 [hgb] 我 要 将 我 的 百 姓 和 你 的 百 姓 分 别 出 来 。 明 天 必 有 这 神 迹 。 [kjv] And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. [bbe] And I will put a division between my people and your people; tomorrow this sign will be seen. 8:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 就 这 样 行 。 苍 蝇 成 了 大 群 ， 进 入 法 老 的 宫 殿 ， 和 他 臣 仆 的 房 屋 ， 埃 及 遍 地 就 因 这 成 群 的 苍 蝇 败 坏 了 。 [kjv] And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants\u0027 houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies. [bbe] And the Lord did so; and great clouds of flies came into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants\u0027 houses, and all the land of Egypt was made waste because of the flies. 8:25 [hgb] 法 老 召 了 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 来 ， 说 ， 你 们 去 ， 在 这 地 祭 祀 你 们 的 神 吧 。 [kjv] And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. [bbe] And Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, Go and make your offering to your God here in the land. 8:26 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 这 样 行 本 不 相 宜 ， 因 为 我 们 要 把 埃 及 人 所 厌 恶 的 祭 祀 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 ， 若 把 埃 及 人 所 厌 恶 的 在 他 们 眼 前 献 为 祭 ， 他 们 岂 不 拿 石 头 打 死 我 们 吗 ？ [kjv] And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? [bbe] And Moses said, It is not right to do so; for we make our offerings of that to which the Egyptians give worship; and if we do so before their eyes, certainly we will be stoned. 8:27 [hgb] 我 们 要 往 旷 野 去 ， 走 三 天 的 路 程 ， 照 着 耶 和 华 我 们 神 所 要 吩 咐 我 们 的 祭 祀 他 。 [kjv] We will go three days\u0027 journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. [bbe] But we will go three days\u0027 journey into the waste land and make an offering to the Lord our God as he may give us orders. 8:28 [hgb] 法 老 说 ， 我 容 你 们 去 ， 在 旷 野 祭 祀 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 只 是 不 要 走 得 很 远 。 求 你 们 为 我 祈 祷 。 [kjv] And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. [bbe] Then Pharaoh said, I will let you go to make an offering to the Lord your God in the waste land; but do not go very far away, and make prayer for me. 8:29 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 我 要 出 去 求 耶 和 华 ， 使 成 群 的 苍 蝇 明 天 离 开 法 老 和 法 老 的 臣 仆 并 法 老 的 百 姓 ， 法 老 却 不 可 再 行 诡 诈 ， 不 容 百 姓 去 祭 祀 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. [bbe] And Moses said, When I go out from you I will make prayer to the Lord that the cloud of flies may go away from Pharaoh and from his people and from his servants tomorrow: only let Pharaoh no longer by deceit keep back the people from making their offering to the Lord. 8:30 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 离 开 法 老 去 求 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. [bbe] Then Moses went out from Pharaoh and made prayer to the Lord. 8:31 [hgb] 耶 和 华 就 照 摩 西 的 话 行 ， 叫 成 群 的 苍 蝇 离 开 法 老 和 他 的 臣 仆 并 他 的 百 姓 ， 一 个 也 没 有 留 下 。 [kjv] And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. [bbe] And the Lord did as Moses said, and took away the cloud of flies from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people; not one was to be seen. 8:32 [hgb] 这 一 次 法 老 又 硬 着 心 ， 不 容 百 姓 去 。 [kjv] And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. [bbe] But again Pharaoh made his heart hard and did not let the people go.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/402.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
