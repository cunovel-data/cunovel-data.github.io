And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took from Moses all the offerings which the children of Israel had given for the building of the holy place. And still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning. \\n\\n 36:4 [hgb] 凡 作 圣 所 一 切 工 的 智 慧 人 各 都 离 开 他 所 作 的 工 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; \\n\\n [bbe] Then the wise men, who were doing all the work of the holy place, came from their work; \\n\\n 36:5 [hgb] 来 对 摩 西 说 ， 百 姓 为 耶 和 华 吩 咐 使 用 之 工 所 拿 来 的 ， 富 富 有 余 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. \\n\\n [bbe] And said to Moses, The people are giving much more than is needed for the work which the Lord has given us orders to do. \\n\\n 36:6 [hgb] 摩 西 传 命 ， 他 们 就 在 全 营 中 宣 告 说 ， 无 论 男 女 ， 不 必 再 为 圣 所 拿 什 么 礼 物 来 。 这 样 才 拦 住 百 姓 不 再 拿 礼 物 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. \\n\\n [bbe] So Moses made an order and had it given out through all the tents, saying, Let no man or woman make any more offerings for the holy place. So the people were kept from giving more. \\n\\n 36:7 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 所 有 的 材 料 够 作 一 切 当 作 的 物 ， 而 且 有 余 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. \\n\\n [bbe] For the material they had was enough and more than enough for all the work which had to be done. \\n\\n 36:8 [hgb] 他 们 中 间 ， 凡 心 里 有 智 慧 作 工 的 ， 用 十 幅 幔 子 作 帐 幕 。 这 幔 子 是 比 撒 列 用 捻 的 细 麻 和 蓝 色 ， 紫 色 ， 朱 红 色 线 制 造 的 ， 并 用 巧 匠 的 手 工 绣 上 基 路 伯 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. \\n\\n [bbe] Then all the expert workmen among them made the House with its ten curtains; of the best linen, blue and purple and red, they made them, with winged ones worked by expert designers. \\n\\n 36:9 [hgb] 每 幅 幔 子 长 二 十 八 肘 ， 宽 四 肘 ， 都 是 一 样 的 尺 寸 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. \\n\\n [bbe] Every curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide, all of the same measure. \\n\\n 36:10 [hgb] 他 使 这 五 幅 幔 子 幅 幅 相 连 ， 又 使 那 五 幅 幔 子 幅 幅 相 连 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. \\n\\n [bbe] And five curtains were joined together, and the other five curtains were joined together. \\n\\n 36:11 [hgb] 在 这 相 连 的 幔 子 末 幅 边 上 作 蓝 色 的 钮 扣 ， 在 那 相 连 的 幔 子 末 幅 边 上 也 照 样 作 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put twists of blue cord on the edge of the outside curtain of the first group, and in the same way on the outside curtain of the second group. \\n\\n 36:12 [hgb] 在 这 相 连 的 幔 子 上 作 五 十 个 钮 扣 ， 在 那 相 连 的 幔 子 上 也 作 五 十 个 钮 扣 ， 都 是 两 两 相 对 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another. \\n\\n [bbe] Fifty twists on the one curtain and fifty on the edge of the curtain of the other group; the twists being opposite to one another. \\n\\n 36:13 [hgb] 又 作 五 十 个 金 钩 ， 使 幔 子 相 连 。 这 才 成 了 一 个 帐 幕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made fifty hooks of gold, joining the curtains one to another with the hooks; and so the House was made. \\n\\n 36:14 [hgb] 他 用 山 羊 毛 织 十 一 幅 幔 子 ， 作 为 帐 幕 以 上 的 罩 棚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made curtains of goats\u0027 hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made curtains of goats\u0027 hair for the tent; eleven curtains were made. \\n\\n 36:15 [hgb] 每 幅 幔 子 长 三 十 肘 ， 宽 四 肘 ， 十 一 幅 幔 子 都 是 一 样 的 尺 寸 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. \\n\\n [bbe] Every curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, all of the same measure. \\n\\n 36:16 [hgb] 他 把 五 幅 幔 子 连 成 一 幅 ， 又 把 六 幅 幔 子 连 成 一 幅 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. \\n\\n [bbe] Five curtains were joined together to make one group, and six curtains were joined together to make the other group. \\n\\n 36:17 [hgb] 在 这 相 连 的 幔 子 末 幅 边 上 作 五 十 个 钮 扣 ， 在 那 相 连 的 幔 子 末 幅 边 上 也 作 五 十 个 钮 扣 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put fifty twists of cord on the edge of the outside curtain of the first group, and fifty twists on the edge of the outside curtain of the second group, \\n\\n 36:18 [hgb] 又 作 五 十 个 铜 钩 ， 使 罩 棚 连 成 一 个 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. \\n\\n [bbe] And fifty hooks of brass for joining them together to make the tent. \\n\\n 36:19 [hgb] 并 用 染 红 的 公 羊 皮 作 罩 棚 的 盖 ， 再 用 海 狗 皮 作 一 层 罩 棚 上 的 顶 盖 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made a covering for the tent of rams\u0027 skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers\u0027 skins above that. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made a cover of sheepskins coloured red, to go over the tent, and a cover of leather over that. \\n\\n 36:20 [hgb] 他 用 皂 荚 木 作 帐 幕 的 竖 板 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up. \\n\\n [bbe] And for the uprights of the House they made boards of hard wood. \\n\\n 36:21 [hgb] 每 块 长 十 肘 ， 宽 一 肘 半 ， \\n\\n [kjv] The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. \\n\\n [bbe] The boards were ten cubits long and one cubit and a half wide. \\n\\n 36:22 [hgb] 每 块 有 两 榫 相 对 。 帐 幕 一 切 的 板 都 是 这 样 作 。 \\n\\n [kjv] One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. \\n\\n [bbe] Every board had two tongues fixed into it;
