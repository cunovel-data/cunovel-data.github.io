And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. \\n\\n [bbe] So they put overseers of forced work over them, in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work. And they made store-towns for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses. \\n\\n 1:12 [hgb] 只 是 越 发 苦 害 他 们 ， 他 们 越 发 多 起 来 ， 越 发 蔓 延 ， 埃 及 人 就 因 以 色 列 人 愁 烦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] But the more cruel they were to them, the more their number increased, till all the land was full of them. And the children of Israel were hated by the Egyptians. \\n\\n 1:13 [hgb] 埃 及 人 严 严 地 使 以 色 列 人 作 工 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: \\n\\n [bbe] And they gave the children of Israel even harder work to do: \\n\\n 1:14 [hgb] 使 他 们 因 作 苦 工 觉 得 命 苦 ， 无 论 是 和 泥 ， 是 做 砖 ， 是 作 田 间 各 样 的 工 ， 在 一 切 的 工 上 都 严 严 地 待 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. \\n\\n [bbe] And made their lives bitter with hard work, making building-material and bricks, and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions. \\n\\n 1:15 [hgb] 有 希 伯 来 的 两 个 收 生 婆 ， 一 名 施 弗 拉 ， 一 名 普 阿 ， 埃 及 王 对 她 们 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: \\n\\n [bbe] And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth (the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah), \\n\\n 1:16 [hgb] 你 们 为 希 伯 来 妇 人 收 生 ， 看 她 们 临 盆 的 时 候 ， 若 是 男 孩 ， 就 把 他 杀 了 ， 若 是 女 孩 ， 就 留 她 存 活 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. \\n\\n [bbe] When you are looking after the Hebrew women in childbirth, if it is a son you are to put him to death; but if it is a daughter, she may go on living. \\n\\n 1:17 [hgb] 但 是 收 生 婆 敬 畏 神 ， 不 照 埃 及 王 的 吩 咐 行 ， 竟 存 留 男 孩 的 性 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. \\n\\n [bbe] But the women had the fear of God, and did not do as the king of Egypt said, but let the male children go on living. \\n\\n 1:18 [hgb] 埃 及 王 召 了 收 生 婆 来 ， 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 作 这 事 ， 存 留 男 孩 的 性 命 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? \\n\\n [bbe] And the king of Egypt sent for the women, and said to them, Why have you done this, and let the male children go on living? \\n\\n 1:19 [hgb] 收 生 婆 对 法 老 说 ， 因 为 希 伯 来 妇 人 与 埃 及 妇 人 不 同 ， 希 伯 来 妇 人 本 是 健 壮 的 （ 原 文 作 活 泼 的 ） ， 收 生 婆 还 没 有 到 ， 她 们 已 经 生 产 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And they said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are strong, and the birth takes place before we come to them. \\n\\n 1:20 [hgb] 神 厚 待 收 生 婆 。 以 色 列 人 多 起 来 ， 极 其 强 盛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. \\n\\n [bbe] And the blessing of God was on these women: and the people were increased in number and became very strong. \\n\\n 1:21 [hgb] 收 生 婆 因 为 敬 畏 神 ， 神 便 叫 她 们 成 立 家 室 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. \\n\\n [bbe] And because the women who took care of the Hebrew mothers had the fear of God, he gave them families. \\n\\n 1:22 [hgb] 法 老 吩 咐 他 的 众 民 说 ， 以 色 列 人 所 生 的 男 孩 ， 你 们 都 要 丢 在 河 里 ， 一 切 的 女 孩 ， 你 们 要 存 留 她 的 性 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. \\n\\n [bbe] And Pharaoh gave orders to all his people, saying, Every son who comes to birth is to be put into the river, but every daughter may go on living. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/319.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
