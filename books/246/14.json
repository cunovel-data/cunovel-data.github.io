And they did so. \n [bbe] And I will make Pharaoh\u0027s heart hard, and he will come after them and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and all his army, so that the Egyptians may see that I am the Lord. And they did so. \n 14:5 [hgb] 有 人 告 诉 埃 及 王 说 ， 百 姓 逃 跑 。 法 老 和 他 的 臣 仆 就 向 百 姓 变 心 ， 说 ， 我 们 容 以 色 列 人 去 ， 不 再 服 事 我 们 ， 这 作 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? \n [bbe] And word came to Pharaoh of the flight of the people: and the feeling of Pharaoh and of his servants about the people was changed, and they said, Why have we let Israel go, so that they will do no more work for us? \n 14:6 [hgb] 法 老 就 预 备 他 的 车 辆 ， 带 领 军 兵 同 去 ， \n [kjv] And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: \n [bbe] So he had his war-carriage made ready and took his people with him: \n 14:7 [hgb] 并 带 着 六 百 辆 特 选 的 车 和 埃 及 所 有 的 车 ， 每 辆 都 有 车 兵 长 。 \n [kjv] And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. \n [bbe] And he took six hundred carriages, all the carriages of Egypt, and captains over all of them. \n 14:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 埃 及 王 法 老 的 心 刚 硬 ， 他 就 追 赶 以 色 列 人 ， 因 为 以 色 列 人 是 昂 然 无 惧 地 出 埃 及 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. \n [bbe] And the Lord made the heart of Pharaoh hard, and he went after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel had gone out without fear. \n 14:9 [hgb] 埃 及 人 追 赶 他 们 ， 法 老 一 切 的 马 匹 ， 车 辆 ， 马 兵 ， 与 军 兵 就 在 海 边 上 ， 靠 近 比 哈 希 录 ， 对 着 巴 力 洗 分 ， 在 他 们 安 营 的 地 方 追 上 了 。 \n [kjv] But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. \n [bbe] But the Egyptians went after them, all the horses and carriages of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them in their tents by the sea, by Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon. \n 14:10 [hgb] 法 老 临 近 的 时 候 ， 以 色 列 人 举 目 看 见 埃 及 人 赶 来 ， 就 甚 惧 怕 ， 向 耶 和 华 哀 求 。 \n [kjv] And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And when Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel, lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians coming after them, and were full of fear; and their cry went up to God. \n 14:11 [hgb] 他 们 对 摩 西 说 ， 难 道 在 埃 及 没 有 坟 地 ， 你 把 我 们 带 来 死 在 旷 野 吗 ？ 你 为 什 么 这 样 待 我 们 ， 将 我 们 从 埃 及 领 出 来 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? \n [bbe] And they said to Moses, Was there no resting-place for the dead in Egypt, that you have taken us away to come to our death in the waste land? why have you taken us out of Egypt? \n 14:12 [hgb] 我 们 在 埃 及 岂 没 有 对 你 说 过 ， 不 要 搅 扰 我 们 ， 容 我 们 服 事 埃 及 人 吗 ？ 因 为 服 事 埃 及 人 比 死 在 旷 野 还 好 。 \n [kjv] Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. \n [bbe] Did we not say to you in Egypt, Let us be as we are, working for the Egyptians? for it is better to be the servants of the Egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land. \n 14:13 [hgb] 摩 西 对 百 姓 说 ， 不 要 惧 怕 ， 只 管 站 住 ， 看 耶 和 华 今 天 向 你 们 所 要 施 行 的 救 恩 。 因 为 ， 你 们 今 天 所 看 见 的 埃 及 人 必 永 远 不 再 看 见 了 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. \n [bbe] But Moses said, Keep where you are and have no fear; now you will see the salvation of the Lord which he will give you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again. \n 14:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 为 你 们 争 战 ， 你 们 只 管 静 默 ， 不 要 作 声 。 \n [kjv] The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. \n [bbe] The Lord will make war for you, you have only to keep quiet. \n 14:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 为 什 么 向 我 哀 求 呢 ？ 你 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 往 前 走 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Why are you crying out to me? give the children of Israel the order to go forward. \n 14:16 [hgb] 你 举 手 向 海 伸 杖 ， 把 水 分 开 。 以 色 列 人 要 下 海 中 走 干 地 。 \n [kjv] But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. \n [bbe] And let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea, and it will be parted in two; and the children of Israel will go through on dry land. \n 14:17 [hgb] 我 要 使 埃 及 人 的 心 刚 硬 ， 他 们 就 跟 着 下 去 。 我 要 在 法 老 和 他 的 全 军 ， 车 辆 ， 马 兵 上 得 荣 耀 。 \n [kjv] And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. \n [bbe] And I will make the heart of the Egyptians hard, and they will go in after them: and I will be honoured over Pharaoh and over his army, his war-carriages, and his horsemen. \n 14:18 [hgb] 我 在 法 老 和 他 的 车 辆 ， 马 兵 上 得 荣 耀 的 时 候 ， 埃 及 人 就 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 了 。 \n [kjv] And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. \n [bbe] And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord, when I get honour over Pharaoh and his war-carriages and his horsemen. \n 14:19 [hgb] 在 以 色 列 营 前 行 走 神 的 使 者 ， 转 到 他 们 后 边 去 ， 云 柱 也 从 他 们 前 边 转 到 他 们 后 边 立 住 。 \n [kjv] And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: \n [bbe] Then the angel of God, who had been before the tents of Israel, took his place at their back; and the pillar of cloud, moving from before them, came to rest at their back: \n 14:20 [hgb] 在 埃 及 营 和 以 色 列 营 中 间 有 云 柱 ， 一 边 黑 暗 ， 一 边 发 光 ， 终 夜 两 下 不 得 相 近 。 \n [kjv] And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. \n [bbe] And it came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel; and there was a dark cloud between them, and they went on through the night; but the one army came no nearer to the other all the night. \n 14:21 [hgb] 摩 西 向 海 伸 杖 ， 耶 和 华 便 用 大 东 风 ， 使 海 水 一 夜 退 去 ， 水 便 分 开 ， 海 就 成 了 干 地 。 \n [kjv] And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. \n [bbe] And when Moses\u0027 hand was stretched out over the sea, the Lord with a strong east wind made the sea go back all night, and the waters were parted in two and the sea became dry land. \n 14:22 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 下 海 中 走 干 地 ， 水 在 他 们 的 左 右 作 了 墙 垣 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land: and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left. \n 14:23 [hgb] 埃 及 人 追 赶 他 们 ， 法 老 一 切 的 马 匹 ， 车 辆 ， 和 马 兵 都 跟 着 下 到 海 中 。 \n [kjv] And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh\u0027s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. \n [bbe] Then the Egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh\u0027s horses and his war-carriages and his horsemen. \n 14:24 [hgb] 到 了 晨 更 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 从 云 火 柱 中 向 埃 及 的 军 兵 观 看 ， 使 埃 及 的 军 兵 混 乱 了 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, \n [bbe] And in the morning watch, the Lord, looking out on the armies of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, sent trouble on the army of the Egyptians; \n 14:25 [hgb] 又 使 他 们 的 车 轮 脱 落 ， 难 以 行 走 ， 以 致 埃 及 人 说 ， 我 们 从 以 色 列 人 面 前 逃 跑 吧 ， 因 耶 和 华 为 他 们 攻 击 我 们 了 。 \n [kjv] And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. \n [bbe] And made the wheels of their war-carriages stiff, so that they had hard work driving them: so the Egyptians said, Let us go in flight from before the face of Israel, for the Lord is fighting for them against the Egyptians. \n 14:26 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 向 海 伸 杖 ， 叫 水 仍 合 在 埃 及 人 并 他 们 的 车 辆 ， 马 兵 身 上 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Let your hand be stretched out over the sea, and the waters will come back again on the Egyptians, and on their war-carriages and on their horsemen. \n 14:27 [hgb] 摩 西 就 向 海 伸 杖 ， 到 了 天 一 亮 ， 海 水 仍 旧 复 原 。 埃 及 人 避 水 逃 跑 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 把 他 们 推 翻 在 海 中 ， \n [kjv] And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. \n [bbe] And when Moses\u0027 hand was stretched out over the sea, at dawn the sea came flowing back, meeting the Egyptians in their flight, and the Lord sent destruction on the Egyptians in the middle of the sea. \n 14:28 [hgb] 水 就 回 流 ， 淹 没 了 车 辆 和 马 兵 。 那 些 跟 着 以 色 列 人 下 海 法 老 的 全 军 ， 连 一 个 也 没 有 剩 下 。 \n [kjv] And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. \n [bbe] And the waters came back, covering the war-carriages and the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh which went after them into the middle of the sea; not one of them was to be seen. \n 14:29 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 却 在 海 中 走 干 地 ， 水 在 他 们 的 左 右 作 了 墙 垣 。 \n [kjv] But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. \n [bbe] But the children of Israel went through the sea walking on dry land, and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left. \n 14:30 [hgb] 当 日 ， 耶 和 华 这 样 拯 救 以 色 列 人 脱 离 埃 及 人 的 手 ， 以 色 列 人 看 见 埃 及 人 的 死 尸 都 在 海 边 了 。 \n [kjv] Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. \n [bbe] So that day the Lord gave Israel salvation from the hands of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea\u0027s edge. \n 14:31 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 看 见 耶 和 华 向 埃 及 人 所 行 的 大 事 ， 就 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 又 信 服 他 和 他 的 仆 人 摩 西 。 \n [kjv] And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. \n [bbe] And Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done against the Egyptians, and the fear of the Lord came on the people and they had faith in the Lord and in his servant Moses. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/408.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;
