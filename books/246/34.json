and I will put on them the words which were on the first stones, which were broken by you. \n 34:2 [hgb] 明 日 早 晨 ， 你 要 预 备 好 了 ， 上 西 乃 山 ， 在 山 顶 上 站 在 我 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. \n [bbe] And be ready by the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai, and come before me there in the morning, on the top of the mountain. \n 34:3 [hgb] 谁 也 不 可 和 你 一 同 上 去 ， 遍 山 都 不 可 有 人 ， 在 山 根 也 不 可 叫 羊 群 牛 群 吃 草 。 \n [kjv] And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. \n [bbe] No one is to come up with you, and let no man be seen anywhere on the mountain; let no flocks or herds come near to get their food at its foot. \n 34:4 [hgb] 摩 西 就 凿 出 两 块 石 版 ， 和 先 前 的 一 样 。 清 晨 起 来 ， 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 上 西 乃 山 去 ， 手 里 拿 着 两 块 石 版 。 \n [kjv] And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. \n [bbe] So Moses got two stones cut like the first; and early in the morning he went up Mount Sinai, as the Lord had said, with the two stones in his hand. \n 34:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 在 云 中 降 临 ， 和 摩 西 一 同 站 在 那 里 ， 宣 告 耶 和 华 的 名 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. \n [bbe] And the Lord came down in the cloud and took his place by the side of Moses, and Moses gave worship to the name of the Lord. \n 34:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 在 他 面 前 宣 告 说 ， 耶 和 华 ， 耶 和 华 ， 是 有 怜 悯 有 恩 典 的 神 ， 不 轻 易 发 怒 ， 并 有 丰 盛 的 慈 爱 和 诚 实 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, \n [bbe] And the Lord went past before his eyes, saying, The Lord, the Lord, a God full of pity and grace, slow to wrath and great in mercy and faith; \n 34:7 [hgb] 为 千 万 人 存 留 慈 爱 ， 赦 免 罪 孽 ， 过 犯 ， 和 罪 恶 ， 万 不 以 有 罪 的 为 无 罪 ， 必 追 讨 他 的 罪 ， 自 父 及 子 ， 直 到 三 ， 四 代 。 \n [kjv] Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children\u0027s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. \n [bbe] Having mercy on thousands, overlooking evil and wrongdoing and sin; he will not let wrongdoers go free, but will send punishment on children for the sins of their fathers, and on their children\u0027s children to the third and fourth generation. \n 34:8 [hgb] 摩 西 急 忙 伏 地 下 拜 ， \n [kjv] And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. \n [bbe] Then Moses quickly went down on his face in worship. \n 34:9 [hgb] 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 若 在 你 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 求 你 在 我 们 中 间 同 行 ， 因 为 这 是 硬 着 颈 项 的 百 姓 。 又 求 你 赦 免 我 们 的 罪 孽 和 罪 恶 ， 以 我 们 为 你 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. \n [bbe] And he said, If now I have grace in your eyes, let the Lord go among us, for this is a stiff-necked people, and give us forgiveness for our wrongdoing and our sin, and take us for your heritage. \n 34:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 要 立 约 ， 要 在 百 姓 面 前 行 奇 妙 的 事 ， 是 在 遍 地 万 国 中 所 未 曾 行 的 。 在 你 四 围 的 外 邦 人 就 要 看 见 耶 和 华 的 作 为 ， 因 我 向 你 所 行 的 是 可 畏 惧 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. \n [bbe] And the Lord said, See, this is what I will undertake: before the eyes of your people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth or in any nation: and all your people will see the work of the Lord, for what I am about to do for you is greatly to be feared. \n 34:11 [hgb] 我 今 天 所 吩 咐 你 的 ， 你 要 谨 守 。 我 要 从 你 面 前 撵 出 亚 摩 利 人 ， 迦 南 人 ， 赫 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 。 \n [kjv] Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. \n [bbe] Take care to do the orders which I give you today; I will send out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. \n 34:12 [hgb] 你 要 谨 慎 ， 不 可 与 你 所 去 那 地 的 居 民 立 约 ， 恐 怕 成 为 你 们 中 间 的 网 罗 ， \n [kjv] Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: \n [bbe] But take care, and do not make any agreement with the people of the land where you are going, for it will be a cause of sin to you. \n 34:13 [hgb] 却 要 拆 毁 他 们 的 祭 坛 ， 打 碎 他 们 的 柱 像 ， 砍 下 他 们 的 木 偶 。 \n [kjv] But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: \n [bbe] But their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down: \n 34:14 [hgb] 不 可 敬 拜 别 神 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 是 忌 邪 的 神 ， 名 为 忌 邪 者 。 \n [kjv] For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: \n [bbe] For you are to be worshippers of no other god: for the Lord is a God who will not give his honour to another. \n 34:15 [hgb] 只 怕 你 与 那 地 的 居 民 立 约 ， 百 姓 随 从 他 们 的 神 ， 就 行 邪 淫 ， 祭 祀 他 们 的 神 ， 有 人 叫 你 ， 你 便 吃 他 的 祭 物 ， \n [kjv] Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; \n [bbe] So see that you make no agreement with the people of the land, and do not go after their gods, or take part in their offerings, or be guests at their feasts, \n 34:16 [hgb] 又 为 你 的 儿 子 娶 他 们 的 女 儿 为 妻 ， 他 们 的 女 儿 随 从 他 们 的 神 ， 就 行 邪 淫 ， 使 你 的 儿 子 也 随 从 他 们 的 神 行 邪 淫 。 \n [kjv] And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. \n [bbe] Or take their daughters for your sons; for when their daughters give worship before their gods, they will make your sons take part with them. \n 34:17 [hgb] 不 可 为 自 己 铸 造 神 像 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. \n [bbe] Make for yourselves no gods of metal. \n 34:18 [hgb] 你 要 守 除 酵 节 ， 照 我 所 吩 咐 你 的 ， 在 亚 笔 月 内 所 定 的 日 期 吃 无 酵 饼 七 天 ， 因 为 你 是 这 亚 笔 月 内 出 了 埃 及 。 \n [kjv] The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. \n [bbe] Keep the feast of unleavened bread; for seven days your food is to be bread without leaven, as I gave you orders, at the regular time in the month Abib; for in that month you came out of Egypt. \n 34:19 [hgb] 凡 头 生 的 都 是 我 的 ， 一 切 牲 畜 头 生 的 ， 无 论 是 牛 是 羊 ， 公 的 都 是 我 的 。 \n [kjv] All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. \n [bbe] Every first male child is mine; the first male birth of your cattle, the first male of every ox and sheep. \n 34:20 [hgb] 头 生 的 驴 要 用 羊 羔 代 赎 ， 若 不 代 赎 就 要 打 折 它 的 颈 项 。 凡 头 生 的 儿 子 都 要 赎 出 来 。 谁 也 不 可 空 手 朝 见 我 。 \n [kjv] But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. \n [bbe] A lamb may be given in payment for the young of an ass, but if you will not make payment for it, its neck will have to be broken. For all the first of your sons you are to make payment. No one is to come before me without an offering. \n 34:21 [hgb] 你 六 日 要 作 工 ， 第 七 日 要 安 息 ， 虽 在 耕 种 收 割 的 时 候 也 要 安 息 。 \n [kjv] Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. \n [bbe] Six days let work be done, but on the seventh day take your rest: at ploughing time and at the grain-cutting you are to have a day for rest. \n 34:22 [hgb] 在 收 割 初 熟 麦 子 的 时 候 要 守 七 七 节 ， 又 在 年 底 要 守 收 藏 节 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year\u0027s end. \n [bbe] And you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first-fruits of the grain, and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields. \n 34:23 [hgb] 你 们 一 切 男 丁 要 一 年 三 次 朝 见 主 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. \n [bbe] Three times in the year let all your males come before the Lord, the God of Israel. \n 34:24 [hgb] 我 要 从 你 面 前 赶 出 外 邦 人 ， 扩 张 你 的 境 界 。 你 一 年 三 次 上 去 朝 见 耶 和 华 你 神 的 时 候 ， 必 没 有 人 贪 慕 你 的 地 土 。 \n [kjv] For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. \n [bbe] For I will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land; and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the Lord, three times in the year. \n 34:25 [hgb] 你 不 可 将 我 祭 物 的 血 和 有 酵 的 饼 一 同 献 上 。 逾 越 节 的 祭 物 也 不 可 留 到 早 晨 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. \n [bbe] No leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering, and the offering of the Passover feast may not be kept till the morning. \n 34:26 [hgb] 地 里 首 先 初 熟 之 物 要 送 到 耶 和 华 你 神 的 殿 。 不 可 用 山 羊 羔 母 的 奶 煮 山 羊 羔 。 \n [kjv] The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\u0027s milk. \n [bbe] Take the first-fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the Lord your God. Let not the young goat be cooked in its mother\u0027s milk \n 34:27 [hgb] 耶 和 华 吩 咐 摩 西 说 ， 你 要 将 这 些 话 写 上 ， 因 为 我 是 按 这 话 与 你 和 以 色 列 人 立 约 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Put all these words in writing; for on them is based the agreement which I will make with you. \n 34:28 [hgb] 摩 西 在 耶 和 华 那 里 四 十 昼 夜 ， 也 不 吃 饭 也 不 喝 水 。 耶 和 华 将 这 约 的 话 ， 就 是 十 条 诫 ， 写 在 两 块 版 上 。 \n [kjv] And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. \n [bbe] And for forty days and forty nights Moses was there with the Lord, and in that time he had no food or drink. And he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement, the ten rules of the law. \n 34:29 [hgb] 摩 西 手 里 拿 着 两 块 法 版 下 西 乃 山 的 时 候 ， 不 知 道 自 己 的 面 皮 因 耶 和 华 和 他 说 话 就 发 了 光 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses\u0027 hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. \n [bbe] Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two stones in his hand, he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with God. \n 34:30 [hgb] 亚 伦 和 以 色 列 众 人 看 见 摩 西 的 面 皮 发 光 就 怕 挨 近 他 。 \n [kjv] And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. \n [bbe] But when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and the shining of his face, they would not come near him for fear. \n 34:31 [hgb] 摩 西 叫 他 们 来 ， 于 是 亚 伦 和 会 众 的 官 长 都 到 他 那 里 去 ， 摩 西 就 与 他 们 说 话 。 \n [kjv] And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. \n [bbe] Then Moses sent for them; and Aaron, with the chiefs of the people, came to him; and Moses had talk with them. \n 34:32 [hgb] 随 后 以 色 列 众 人 都 近 前 来 ， 他 就 把 耶 和 华 在 西 乃 山 与 他 所 说 的 一 切 话 都 吩 咐 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. \n [bbe] And later, all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the orders which the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai. \n 34:33 [hgb] 摩 西 与 他 们 说 完 了 话 就 用 帕 子 蒙 上 脸 。 \n [kjv] And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. \n [bbe] And at the end of his talk with them, Moses put a veil over his face. \n 34:34 [hgb] 但 摩 西 进 到 耶 和 华 面 前 与 他 说 话 就 揭 去 帕 子 ， 及 至 出 来 的 时 候 便 将 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 告 诉 以 色 列 人 。 \n [kjv] But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. \n [bbe] But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to have talk with him, he took off the veil till he came out. And whenever he came out he said to the children of Israel what he had been ordered to say; \n 34:35 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 看 见 摩 西 的 面 皮 发 光 。 摩 西 又 用 帕 子 蒙 上 脸 ， 等 到 他 进 去 与 耶 和 华 说 话 ， 就 揭 去 帕 子 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses\u0027 face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel saw that the face of Moses was shining: so Moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/428.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
