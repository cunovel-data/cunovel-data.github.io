These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. \n [bbe] And you will be a kingdom of priests to me, and a holy nation. These are the words which you are to say to the children of Israel. \n 19:7 [hgb] 摩 西 去 召 了 民 间 的 长 老 来 ， 将 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 话 都 在 他 们 面 前 陈 明 。 \n [kjv] And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. \n [bbe] And Moses came and sent for the chiefs of the people and put before them all these words which the Lord had given him orders to say. \n 19:8 [hgb] 百 姓 都 同 声 回 答 说 ， 凡 耶 和 华 所 说 的 ， 我 们 都 要 遵 行 。 摩 西 就 将 百 姓 的 话 回 覆 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And all the people, answering together, said, Whatever the Lord has said we will do. And Moses took back to the Lord the words of the people. \n 19:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 我 要 在 密 云 中 临 到 你 那 里 ， 叫 百 姓 在 我 与 你 说 话 的 时 候 可 以 听 见 ， 也 可 以 永 远 信 你 了 。 于 是 ， 摩 西 将 百 姓 的 话 奏 告 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, See, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that what I say to you may come to the ears of the people and they may have belief in you for ever. And Moses gave the Lord word of what the people had said. \n 19:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 往 百 姓 那 里 去 ， 叫 他 们 今 天 明 天 自 洁 ， 又 叫 他 们 洗 衣 服 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow, and let their clothing be washed. \n 19:11 [hgb] 到 第 三 天 要 预 备 好 了 ， 因 为 第 三 天 耶 和 华 要 在 众 百 姓 眼 前 降 临 在 西 乃 山 上 。 \n [kjv] And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. \n [bbe] And by the third day let them be ready: for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai, before the eyes of all the people. \n 19:12 [hgb] 你 要 在 山 的 四 围 给 百 姓 定 界 限 ， 说 ， 你 们 当 谨 慎 ， 不 可 上 山 去 ， 也 不 可 摸 山 的 边 界 ， 凡 摸 这 山 的 ， 必 要 治 死 他 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: \n [bbe] And let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain, and say to them, Take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it: whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death: \n 19:13 [hgb] 不 可 用 手 摸 他 ， 必 用 石 头 打 死 ， 或 用 箭 射 透 ， 无 论 是 人 是 牲 畜 ， 都 不 得 活 。 到 角 声 拖 长 的 时 候 ， 他 们 才 可 到 山 根 来 。 \n [kjv] There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. \n [bbe] He is not to be touched by a hand, but is to be stoned or have an arrow put through him; man or beast, he is to be put to death: at the long sounding of a horn they may come up to the mountain. \n 19:14 [hgb] 摩 西 下 山 往 百 姓 那 里 去 ， 叫 他 们 自 洁 ， 他 们 就 洗 衣 服 。 \n [kjv] And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. \n [bbe] Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and made the people holy; and their clothing was washed. \n 19:15 [hgb] 他 对 百 姓 说 ， 到 第 三 天 要 预 备 好 了 。 不 可 亲 近 女 人 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. \n [bbe] And he said to the people, Be ready by the third day: do not come near a woman. \n 19:16 [hgb] 到 了 第 三 天 早 晨 ， 在 山 上 有 雷 轰 ， 闪 电 ， 和 密 云 ， 并 且 角 声 甚 大 ， 营 中 的 百 姓 尽 都 发 颤 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. \n [bbe] And when morning came on the third day, there were thunders and flames and a thick cloud on the mountain, and a horn sounding very loud; and all the people in the tents were shaking with fear. \n 19:17 [hgb] 摩 西 率 领 百 姓 出 营 迎 接 神 ， 都 站 在 山 下 。 \n [kjv] And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. \n [bbe] And Moses made the people come out of their tents and take their places before God; and they came to the foot of the mountain, \n 19:18 [hgb] 西 乃 全 山 冒 烟 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 在 火 中 降 于 山 上 。 山 的 烟 气 上 腾 ， 如 烧 窑 一 般 ， 遍 山 大 大 地 震 动 。 \n [kjv] And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. \n [bbe] And all the mountain of Sinai was smoking, for the Lord had come down on it in fire: and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a great burning; and all the mountain was shaking. \n 19:19 [hgb] 角 声 渐 渐 地 高 而 又 高 ， 摩 西 就 说 话 ， 神 有 声 音 答 应 他 。 \n [kjv] And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. \n [bbe] And when the sound of the horn became louder and louder, Moses\u0027 words were answered by the voice of God. \n 19:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 降 临 在 西 乃 山 顶 上 ， 耶 和 华 召 摩 西 上 山 顶 ， 摩 西 就 上 去 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. \n [bbe] Then the Lord came down on to Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and the Lord sent for Moses to come up to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. \n 19:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 下 去 嘱 咐 百 姓 ， 不 可 闯 过 来 到 我 面 前 观 看 ， 恐 怕 他 们 有 多 人 死 亡 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Go down and give the people orders to keep back, for fear that a great number of them, forcing their way through to see the Lord, may come to destruction. \n 19:22 [hgb] 又 叫 亲 近 我 的 祭 司 自 洁 ， 恐 怕 我 忽 然 出 来 击 杀 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. \n [bbe] And let the priests who come near to the Lord make themselves holy, for fear that the Lord may come on them suddenly. \n 19:23 [hgb] 摩 西 对 耶 和 华 说 ， 百 姓 不 能 上 西 乃 山 ， 因 为 你 已 经 嘱 咐 我 们 说 ， 要 在 山 的 四 围 定 界 限 ， 叫 山 成 圣 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. \n [bbe] And Moses said to the Lord, The people will not be able to come up the mountain, for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain, marking it out and making it holy. \n 19:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 他 说 ， 下 去 吧 ， 你 要 和 亚 伦 一 同 上 来 ， 只 是 祭 司 和 百 姓 不 可 闯 过 来 上 到 我 面 前 ， 恐 怕 我 忽 然 出 来 击 杀 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to him, Go down, and you and Aaron may come up; but let not the priests and the people make their way through to the Lord, or he will come on them suddenly. \n 19:25 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 下 到 百 姓 那 里 告 诉 他 们 。 \n [kjv] So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. \n [bbe] So Moses went down to the people and said this to them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/7/413.html","bookId":246,"book":{"id":246,"title":"Exodus出埃及记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;
