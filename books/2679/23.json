{"id":68071,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"The colonel crossed his legs. \"If she would only smash up the radio, then.\"\n \"Then we don\u0027t care if he kills her?\"\n \"You said it.\"\n Godliman spoke into the phone. \"Get me Bloggs at Rosyth.\"\n Bloggs woke up with a start, and listened. Outside it was dawn. Everyone in the scramble hut was listening too. They could hear nothing. That was what they were listening to: the silence. The rain had stopped drumming on the tin roof.\n Bloggs went to the window. The sky was grey, with a band of white on the eastern horizon. The wind had dropped suddenly and the rain had become a light drizzle.\n The pilots started putting on jackets and helmets, lacing boots, lighting up last cigarettes.\n A klaxon sounded, and a voice boomed out over the airfield: \"Scramble! Scramble!\"\n The phone rang. The pilots ignored it and piled out through the door. Bloggs picked it up. \"Yes?\"\n \"Percy here, Fred. We just contacted the island. He\u0027s killed the two men. The woman\u0027s managing to hold him off at the moment but she clearly won\u0027t last much longer.\"\n \"The rain has stopped. We\u0027re taking off now,\" Bloggs said.\n \"Make it fast, Fred. Good-bye.\"\n Bloggs hung up and looked around for his pilot. Charles Calder had fallen asleep over War and Peace. Bloggs shook him roughly. \"Wake up, you dozy bastard, wake up!\" Calder opened his eyes.\n Bloggs could have hit him. \"Wake up, come on, we\u0027re going, the storm\u0027s ended!\"\n The pilot jumped to his feet. \"Jolly good show,\" he said.\n He ran out of the door and Bloggs followed, shaking his head.\n The lifeboat dropped into the water with a crack like a pistol and a wide V-shaped splash. The sea was far from calm, but here in the partial shelter of the bay there was no risk to a stout boat in the hands of experienced sailors. The captain said, \"Carry on, Number One.\"\n The first mate was standing at the rail with three of the ratings. He wore a pistol in a waterproof holster. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he told them.\n The four men scrambled down the ladders and into the boat. The first mate sat in the stern and the three sailors broke out the oars and began to row.\n For a few moments the captain watched their steady progress toward the jetty, then he went back to the bridge and gave orders for the corvette to continue circling the island.\n The shrill ringing of a bell broke up the card game on the cutter. Slim said, \"I thought something was different. We aren\u0027t going up and down so much. Almost motionless, really. Makes me damn seasick.\" Nobody was listening: the crew were hurrying to their stations, some of them fastening life jackets as they went.\n The engines fired with a roar, and the vessel began to tremble faintly. Up on deck Smith stood in the prow, enjoying the fresh air and the spray on his face after a day and a night below. As the cutter left the harbour Slim joined him. \"Here we go again,\" Slim said.\n \"I knew the bell was going to ring then,\" Smith said. \"You know why?\"\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"I was holding ace and a king. Banker\u0027s Twenty-one.\"\n Lieutenant Commander Werner Heer looked at his watch. \"Thirty minutes.\"\n Major Wohl nodded. \"What\u0027s the weather like?\"\n \"The storm has ended,\" Heer said reluctantly. He would have preferred to keep that information to himself.\n \"Then we should surface.\"\n \"If your man were there, he would send us a signal.\"\n \"The war is not won by hypothesis, captain,\" said Wohl. \"I firmly suggest that we surface.\"\n There had been a blazing row while the U-boat was in dock between Heer\u0027s superior officer and Wohl\u0027s; and Wohl\u0027s had won. Heer was still captain of the ship, but he had been told in no uncertain terms that he had better have a damned good reason next time he ignored one of Major Wohl\u0027s firm suggestions.\n \"We will surface at six o\u0027clock exactly,\" he said. Wohl nodded again and looked away.\n The sound of breaking glass, then an explosion like an incendiary bomb: Whoomph...\n Lucy dropped the microphone. Something was happening downstairs. She picked up a shotgun and ran down.\n The living room was ablaze. The fire centred on a broken jar on the floor.\n Henry had made some kind of bomb with the petrol from the jeep. The flames were spreading across Tom\u0027s threadbare carpet and licking up over the loose covers of his ancient three-piece suite. A feather-filled cushion caught and the fire reached up toward the ceiling.\n Lucy picked up the cushion and threw it through the broken window, singeing her hand. She tore her coat off and threw it on the carpet, stamping on it. She picked it up again and draped it over the floral settee. There was another crash of glass. It came from upstairs. Lucy screamed. \"Jo!\"\n She dropped the coat and rushed up the stairs and into the front bedroom. Faber was sitting on the bed with Jo on his lap. The child was awake, sucking his thumb, wearing his wide-eyed morning look. Faber was stroking his tousled hair.\n \"Throw the gun on the bed, Lucy.\"\n Her shoulders sagged and she did as he said. \"You climbed the wall and got through the window,\" she said dully. Faber dumped Jo off his lap. \"Go to Mummy.\" Jo ran to her and she lifted him up.\n He picked up both guns and went to the radio. He was holding his right hand under his left armpit, and there was a great red bloodstain on his jacket. He sat down. \"You hurt me,\" he said. Then he turned his attention to the transmitter.\n Suddenly it spoke. \"Come in, Storm Island.\" He picked up the microphone. \"Hello?\"\n \"Just a minute.\"\n There was a pause, then another voice came on. Lucy recognised it as the man in London who had told her to destroy the radio. He would be disappointed in her. It said, \"Hello, this is Godliman again. Can you hear me? Over.\" Faber said, \"Yes, I can hear you, professor. Seen any good cathedrals lately?\"\n \"What?... is that-\"\n \"Yes.\" Faber smiled. \"How do you do.\" Then the smile abruptly left his face, as if playtime was over, and he manipulated the frequency dial of the radio. Lucy turned and left the room. It was over. She walked listlessly down the stairs and into the kitchen. There was nothing for her to do but wait for him to kill her. She could not run away; she did not have the energy, and he obviously knew it.\n She looked out of the window. The storm had ended. The howling gale had dropped to a stiff breeze, there was no rain, and the eastern sky was bright with the promise of sunshine.\n The sea...\n She frowned, and looked again.\n Yes, my God, it was a submarine.\n Destroy the radio, the man had said.\n Last night Henry had cursed in a foreign language... \"did it for my country,\" he had said.\n And, in his delirium, something about waiting at Calais for a phantom army...\n Destroy the radio.\n Why would a man take a can of photographic negatives on a fishing trip?\n She had known all along he was not insane.\n The submarine was a German U-boat, Henry was some kind of German agent... spy?... this very moment he must be trying to contact that U-boat by radio...\n Destroy the radio.\n She had no right to give up, she couldn\u0027t, now that she understood. She knew what she had to do.\n She would have liked to put Jo somewhere else, where he could not see it-that bothered her more than the pain she knew she would feel-but there was no time for that. Henry would surely find his frequency at any second and then it might be too late. She had to destroy the radio, but the radio was upstairs with Henry, and he had both the guns and he would kill her. She knew only one way to do it.\n She placed one of Tom\u0027s kitchen chairs in the centre of the room, stood on it, reached up and unscrewed the light bulb.\n She got down off the chair, went to the door and threw the switch. \"Are you changing the bulb?\" Jo asked.\n Lucy climbed on the chair, hesitated for a moment, then thrust three fingers into the live socket.\n There was a bang, an instant of agony, and then unconsciousness.\n Faber heard the bang. He had found the right frequency on the transmitter, had thrown the switch to \"Transmit\" and had picked up the microphone. He was about to speak when the noise came. Immediately afterward the lights on the dials of the wireless set went out.\n His face suffused with anger. She had short-circuited the electricity supply to the whole house. He had not credited her with that much ingenuity.\n He should have killed her before. What was wrong with him? He had never hesitated, not ever, until he met this woman.\n He picked up one of the guns and went downstairs.\n The child was crying. Lucy lay in the kitchen doorway, out cold. Faber took in the empty light socket with the chair beneath it. He frowned in amazement.\n She had done it with her hand. Faber said: \"Jesus Christ Almighty.\"\n Lucy\u0027s eyes opened. She hurt all over.\n Henry was standing over her with the gun in his hands. He was saying, \"Why did you use your hand? Why not a screwdriver?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know you could do it with a screwdriver.\"\n He shook his head. \"You are truly an astonishing woman,\" he said as he lifted the gun, aimed it at her, and lowered it again. \"Damn you.\" His gaze went to the window, and he started. \"You saw it,\" he said.\n She nodded.\n He stood tense for a moment, then went to the door. Finding it nailed shut, he smashed the window with the butt of his gun and climbed out. Lucy got to her feet. Jo threw his arms around her legs. She did not feel strong enough to pick him up. She staggered to the window and looked out.\n He was running toward the cliff. The U-boat was still there, perhaps half a mile offshore. He reached the cliff edge and crawled over. He was going to try to swim to the submarine.\n She had to stop him.\n Dear God, no more...\n She climbed through the window, blotting out the cries of her son, and ran after him.\n When she reached the cliff edge she lay down and looked over. He was about halfway between her and the sea. He looked up and saw her, froze for a moment, and then began to move faster, dangerously fast.\n Her first thought was to climb down after him. But what would she do Then? Even if she caught him, she couldn\u0027t possibly stop him.\n The ground beneath her shifted slightly. She scrambled back, afraid it would give way and throw her down the cliff.\n Which gave her the idea.\n She thumped on the rocky ground with both fists. It seemed to shake a little more and a crack appeared. She got one hand over the edge and thrust the other into the crack. A piece of earthy chalk the size of a watermelon came away in her hands.\n She looked over the edge and sighted him.\n She took careful aim and dropped the stone.\n It seemed to fall very slowly. He saw it coming, and covered his head with his arm. It looked to her as if it would miss him.\n The rock passed within a few inches of his head and hit his left shoulder. He was holding on with his left hand. He seemed to lose his grip and he balanced precariously for a moment. The right hand, the injured one, scrabbled for a hold. Then he appeared to lean out, away from the face of the rock, arms windmilling, until his feet slipped from their narrow ledge and he was in midair, suspended; and finally he dropped like a stone to the rocks below.\n He made no sound.\n He landed on a flat rock that jutted above the surface of the water. The noise his body made hitting the rock sickened her. He lay there on his back, arms outflung, head at an impossible angle.\n Something seeped out from inside him on to the stone, and Lucy turned away. Everything seemed to happen at once then.\n There was a roaring sound from the sky and three aircraft with RAF circles on their wings flew out of the clouds and dipped low over the U-boat, their guns firing. Four sailors came up the hill toward the house at a jog trot, one of them shouting, \"Left-right-left-right-left-right.\"\n Another plane landed on the sea, a dinghy emerged from inside it and a man in a life jacket began to row toward the cliff.\n A small ship came around the headland and steamed toward the U-boat. The U-boat submerged.\n The dinghy bumped into the rocks at the foot of the cliff, and the man got out and examined Faber\u0027s body. A boat she recognised as the Coastguard cutter appeared.\n One of the sailors came up to her. \"Are you all right, love? There\u0027s a little girl in the cottage crying for her mummy.\"\n \"It\u0027s a boy,\" Lucy said, \"I must cut his hair.\"\n Bloggs steered the dinghy toward the body at the foot of the cliff. The boat bumped against the rock and he scrambled out and-onto the flat surface.\n Die Nadel\u0027s skull had smashed like a glass goblet when he hit the rock. Looking more closely. Bloggs could see that the man had been somewhat battered even before the fall: his right hand was mutilated and there was something wrong with his ankle.\n Bloggs searched the body. The stiletto was where he had guessed it might be: in a sheath strapped to the left forearm. In the inside pocket of the expensive-looking bloodstained jacket, Bloggs found a wallet, papers, money, and a small film can containing twenty-four 35mm photographic negatives. He held them up to the strengthening light: they were the negatives of the prints found in the envelopes Faber had sent to the Portuguese Embassy.\n The sailors on the cliff top threw down a rope. Bloggs put Faber\u0027s possessions into his own pocket, then tied the rope around the body. They hauled it up, then sent the rope down for Bloggs.\n When he got to the top, the sub-lieutenant introduced himself and they walked across to the cottage on top of the hill.\n \"We haven\u0027t touched anything, didn\u0027t want to destroy evidence,\" the senior sailor said.\n \"Don\u0027t worry too much,\" Bloggs told him. \"There won\u0027t be a prosecution.\"\n They had to enter the house through the broken kitchen window. The woman was sitting at a table with the child on her lap. Bloggs smiled at her. He could not think of anything to say.\n He looked quickly around the cottage. It was a battlefield. He saw the nailed-up windows, the barred doors, the remains of the fire, the dog with its throat cut, the shotguns, the broken bannister, and the axe embedded in the windowsill beside two severed fingers. He thought, What kind of woman is she?\n He set the sailors to work: one to tidy the house and unbar the doors and windows, another to replace the blown fuse, a third to make tea.\n He sat down in front of the woman and looked at her. She was dressed in ill-fitting, mannish clothes; her hair was wet; her face was dirty. Despite all that, she was remarkably beautiful, with lovely amber eyes in an oval face.\n Bloggs smiled at the child and spoke quietly to the woman. \"What you\u0027ve done is tremendously important,\" he said. \"One of these days we\u0027ll explain, but for now I have to ask you two questions. Is that okay?\" Her eyes focused on him and after a moment she nodded. \"Did Faber succeed in contacting the U-boat by radio?\" The woman just looked blank.\n Bloggs found a toffee in his trousers pocket. \"Can I give the boy a sweet? He looks hungry.\"\n \"Thank you,\" she said.\n \"Now, did Faber contact the U-boat?\"\n \"His name was Henry Baker,\" she said.\n \"Oh. Well, did he?\"\n \"No. I short-circuited the electricity.\"\n \"That was very smart,\" Bloggs said. \"How did you do it?\"\n She pointed at the empty light socket above them.\n \"Screwdriver, eh?\"\n \"No. I wasn\u0027t that smart. Fingers.\"\n He gave her a look of horror, disbelief. The thought of deliberately... he shook himself, trying to put it out of his mind. And thought again, What kind of woman is she?...\n \"Right, well, do you think anyone on the U-boat could have seen him coming down the cliff?\"\n The effort of concentration showed on her face. \"Nobody came out of the hatch, I\u0027m quite sure,\" she said.\n \"Could they have seen him through their periscope?\"\n \"No,\" she said.\n \"This is good news, very good news. It means they don\u0027t know he\u0027s been... neutralised. Anyway...\" He changed the subject hastily. \"You\u0027ve been through as much as any man on the front line. More. We\u0027re going to get you and the boy to a hospital on the mainland.\"\n \"Yes,\" she said.\n Bloggs turned to the senior sailor. \"Is there any form of transport around?\"\n \"Yes a jeep down in that little stand of trees.\"\n \"Good. Will you drive these two over to the jetty and get them onto your boat?\"\n \"Surely.\"\n Bloggs turned to the woman again. He felt a tremendous surge of affection mixed with admiration for her. She looked frail and helpless now, but he knew she was as brave and strong as she was beautiful. Surprising her and himself he took hold of her hand. \"When you\u0027ve been in hospital a day or two you\u0027ll begin to feel depressed. But that\u0027s a sign you\u0027re getting better. I won\u0027t be far away and the doctors will tell me. I\u0027ll want to talk to you some more, but not before you feel like it. Okay?\"\n At last she smiled at him, and he felt the warmth. \"You\u0027re very kind.\" she said. She stood up and carried her child out of the house.\n \"Kind?\" Bloggs muttered to himself. \"God, what a woman.\"\n He went upstairs to the radio and tuned it to the Royal Observer Corps frequency.\n \"Storm Island calling, over.\"\n \"Come in, Storm Island.\"\n \"Patch me through to London.\"\n \"Hold on.\" There was a long pause, then a familiar voice, \"Godliman.\"\n \"Percy. We caught the... smuggler. He\u0027s dead.\"\n \"Marvellous, marvellous.\" There was undisguised triumph in Godliman\u0027s voice. \"Did he manage to contact his partner?\"\n \"Almost certainly not.\"\n \"Well done, well done!\"\n \"Don\u0027t congratulate me,\" Bloggs said. \"By the time I got here it was all over, bar the tidying up.\"\n \"Who...?\"\n \"The woman.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m damned. What\u0027s she like?\"\n Bloggs grinned. \"She\u0027s a hero, Percy.\"\n And Godliman, smiling on his end now too, understood.\n Hitler stood at the panoramic window, looking out at the mountains. He wore his dove-grey uniform, and he looked tired and depressed. He had called his physician during the night. Admiral Puttkamer saluted and said good morning.\n Hitler turned and peered closely at his aide-de-camp. Those beady eyes never failed to unnerve Puttkamer. \"Was Die Nadel picked up?\"\n \"No. There was some trouble at the rendezvous. The English police were chasing smugglers. It appears Die Nadel was not there anyway. He sent a wireless message a few minutes ago.\" He offered a sheet of paper.\n Hitler took it from him, put on his spectacles, and began to read:\n YOUR RENDEZVOUS INSECURE YOU CUNTS I AM WOUNDED AND TRANSMITTING LEFT HANDED FIRST UNITED STATES ARMY GROUP ASSEMBLED EAST ANGLIA UNDER PATTON ORDER OF BATTLE AS FOLLOWS TWENTYONE INFANTRY DIVISIONS FIVE ARMOURED DIVISIONS APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND AIRCRAFT PLUS REQUISITE TROOPSHIPS IN THE WASH FUSAG WILL ATTACK CALAIS JUNE FIFTEENTH REGARDS TO WILLI\n Hitler handed the message back to Puttkamer and sighed. \"So it\u0027s Calais, after all.\"\n \"Can we be sure of this man?\" the aide asked.\n \"Absolutely.\" Hitler turned and walked across the room to a chair. His movements were stiff and he seemed in paim. \"He is a loyal German. I know him. I know his family.\"\n \"But your instinct...\"\n \"Ach... I said I would trust this man\u0027s report, and I shall.\" He made a gesture of dismissal. \"Tell Rommel and Rundstedt they can\u0027t have their panzers. And send in that damned doctor.\"\n Puttkamer saluted again and went out to relay the orders.\n When Germany defeated England in the quarterfinal of the 1970 World Cup soccer tournament, grandpa was furious.\n He sat in front of the colour television set and muttered through his beard at the screen. \"Cunning!\" he told the assorted experts who were now disgecting the game. \"Cunning and stealth! That\u0027s the way to defeat the damned Germans.\"\n He would not be mollified until his grandchildren arrived. Jo\u0027s white Jaguar drew up on the drive of the modest three-bedroom house, and then Jo himself, prosperous-looking in a suede jacket, along with his wife Ann and their children, went in. Jo said, \"Did you watch the football, pop?\"\n \"Terrible, we were rubbish.\" Since he\u0027d retired from the Force and had more leisure time he had taken an interest in sports.\n \"The Germans were better,\" Jo said. \"They play good football. We can\u0027t win it every time.\"\n \"Don\u0027t talk to me about bloody Germans. Cunning and stealth, that\u0027s the way to beat them.\" He addressed the grandson on his lap. \"That\u0027s the way we beat them in the war, Davy, we tricked them proper.\"\n \"How did you trick them?\" Davy asked.\n \"Well, see, we made them think...\" His voice became low and conspiratorial, and the little boy giggled in anticipation. \"We made them think we were going to attack Calais-\"\n \"That\u0027s in France, not Germany.\"\n Ann shushed him. \"Let your grandpa tell his stories.\"\n \"Anyway,\" grandpa continued, \"we made them think we were going to attack Calais, so they put all their tanks and soldiers there.\" He used a cushion to represent France, an ashtray for the Germans, and a penknife for the Allies. \"But we attacked Normandy, and there was nobody much there but old Rommel and a few popguns.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t they find out about the trick?\" David asked.\n \"They nearly did. In fact, there was one spy who did find out.\"\n \"What happened to him?\"\n \"We killed him before he could tell.\"\n \"Did you kill him, grandpa?\"\n \"No, your grandma did.\"\n Grandma came in then, carrying a teapot. \"Fred Bloggs, are you frightening the children?\"\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t they know?\" he groused. \"She\u0027s got a medal, you know. She won\u0027t tell me where she keeps it becawe she doesn\u0027t like me showing it to visitors.\"\n She was pouring tea. \"It\u0027s all over now and best forgotten.\" She handed a cup and saucer to her husband.\n He took her arm and held her there. \"It\u0027s far from over,\" he said, and his voice was suddenly gentle.\n They looked at each other for a moment. Her beautiful hair was greying now and she wore it up in a bun. She was heavier than she used to be. But her eyes were still the same: large and amber and remarkably beautiful. Those eyes looked back at him now, and they both were very still, remembering.\n Until David jumped off his grandpa\u0027s lap and knocked the cup of tea to the floor and the spell was broken. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle/page-23.html","bookId":2679,"book":{"id":2679,"title":"Eye Of The Needle","description":"Storyline: \n One enemy spy knows the secret to the Allies\u0027 greatest deception, a brilliant aristocrat and ruthless assassin -- code name: \"The Needle\" -- who holds the key to ultimate Nazi victory. \n Only one person stands in his way: a lonely Englishwoman on an isolated island, who is beginning to love the killer who has mysteriously entered her life. \n All will come to a terrifying conclusion in Ken Follett\u0027s unsurpassed and unforgettable masterwork of suspense, intrigue, and the dangerous machinations of the human heart.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/eye-of-the-needle.jpg","author":"Ken Follett","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM"}}
