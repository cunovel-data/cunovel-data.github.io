{"id":68054,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The landlord was sniffing. \"Has he been cooking in his rooms?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t know, Mr Riley.\" The two of them went up the stairs. The old man said, \"He\u0027s very quiet, if he is in there.\" \"Whatever he\u0027s cooking, he\u0027ll have to stop. It smells bloody awful.\" The landlord knocked on the door. There was no answer. He opened it and went in, and the old man followed him. \"Well, well, well,\" the old sergeant said heartily. \"I think you\u0027ve got a dead one.\" He stood in the doorway, surveying the room. \"You touched anything, Paddy?\" \"No,\" the landlord replied. \"And the name\u0027s Mr Riley.\" The policeman ignored this. \"Not long dead, though. I\u0027ve smelled worse.\" His survey took in the old chest of drawers, the suitcase on the low table, the faded square of carpet, the dirty curtains on the dormer window, and the rumpled bed in the corner. There were no signs of a struggle. He went over to the bed. The young man\u0027s face was peaceful, his hands clasped over his chest. \"I\u0027d say heart attack, if he wasn\u0027t so young.\" There was no empty sleeping-pill bottle to indicate suicide. He picked up the leather wallet on top of the chest and looked through its contents. There was an identity card and a ration book, and a fairly thick wad of notes. \"Papers in order and he ain\u0027t been robbed.\" \"He\u0027s only been here a week or so,\" the landlord said. \"I don\u0027t know much about him at all. He came from North Wales to work in a factory.\" \"Well,\" the sergeant observed, \"if he was as healthy as he looked he\u0027d be in the Army.\" He opened the suitcase on the table. \"Bloody hell, what\u0027s this lot?\" The landlord and the old man had edged their way into the room now. The landlord said, \"It\u0027s a radio\" at the same time as the old man said, \"He\u0027s bleeding.\" \"Don\u0027t touch that body!\" the sergeant said. \"He\u0027s had a knife in the guts,\" the old man persisted. The sergeant gingerly lifted one of the dead hands from the chest to reveal a small trickle of dried blood. \"He was bleeding,\" he said. \"Where\u0027s the nearest phone?\" \"Five doors down,\" the landlord told him. \"Lock this room and stay out until I get back.\" The sergeant left the house and knocked at the door of the neighbour with the phone. A woman opened it. \"Good morning, madam. May I use your telephone?\" \"Come in.\" She showed him the phone, on a stand in the hall. \"What\u0027s happened? Anything exciting?\" \"A tenant died in a lodging house just up the road,\" he told her as he dialled. \"Murdered?\" she asked, wide-eyed. \"I leave that to the experts. Hello? Superintendent Jones, please. This is Canter.\" He looked at the woman. \"Might I ask you just to pop in the kitchen while I talk to my governor?\" She went, disappointed. \"Hello, Super. This body\u0027s got a knife wound and a suitcase radio.\" \"What\u0027s the address again, Sarge?\" Sergeant Canter told him. \"Yes, that\u0027s the one they\u0027ve been watching. This is an MI5 job, Sarge. Go to number 42 and tell the surveillance team there what you\u0027ve found. I\u0027ll get on to their chief. Off you go.\" Canter thanked the woman and crossed the road. He was quite thrilled; this was only his second murder in thirty-one years as a Metropolitan Policeman, and it turned out to involve espionage! He might make Inspector yet. He knocked on the door of number 42. It opened and two men stood there. Sergeant Canter said: \"Are you the secret agents from MI5?\" Bloggs arrived at the same time as a Special Branch man, Detective-Inspector Harris, whom he had known in his Scotland Yard days. Canter showed them the body. They stood still for a moment, looking at the peaceful young face with its blond moustache. Harris said, \"Who is he?\" \"Codename Blondie,\" Bloggs told him. \"We think he came in by parachute a couple of weeks ago. We picked up a radio message to another agent arranging a rendezvous. We knew the code, so we were able to watch the rendezvous. We hoped Blondie would lead us to the resident agent, who would be a much more dangerous specimen.\" \"So what happened here?\" \"Damned if I know.\" Harris looked at the wound in the agent\u0027s chest. \"Stiletto?\" \"Something like that. A very neat job. Under the ribs and straight up into the heart. Quick. Would you like to see the method of entry?\" He led them downstairs to the kitchen. They looked at the windowframe and the unbroken pane of glass lying on the lawn. Canter said, \"Also, the lock on the bedroom door had been picked.\" They sat down at the kitchen table, and Canter made tea. Bloggs said, \"It happened the night after I lost him in Leicester Square. I fouled it all up.\" Harris said, \"Don\u0027t be so hard on yourself.\" They drank their tea in silence for a while. Harris said, \"How are things with you, anyway? You don\u0027t drop in at the Yard.\" \"Busy.\" \"How\u0027s Christine?\" \"Killed in the bombing.\" Harris\u0027 eyes widened. \"You poor bastard.\" \"You all right?\" \"Lost my brother in North Africa. Did you ever meet Johnny?\" \"No.\" \"He was a lad. Drink? You\u0027ve never seen anything like it. Spent so much on booze, he could never afford to get married-which is just as well, the way things turned out.\" \"Most have lost somebody, I s\u0027pose.\" \"If you\u0027re on your own, come round our place for dinner on Sunday.\" \"Thanks, I work Sundays now.\" Harris nodded. \"Well, whenever you feel like it.\" A detective-constable poked his bead around the door and addressed Harris. \"Can we start bagging-up the evidence, guv?\" Harris looked at Bloggs. \"I\u0027ve finished,\" Bloggs said. \"All right, son, carry on,\" Harris told him. Bloggs said, \"Suppose he made contact after I lost him, and arranged for the resident agent to come here. The resident may have suspected a trap-that would explain why he came in through the window and picked the lock.\" \"It makes him a devilish suspicious bastard,\" Harris observed. \"That might be why we\u0027ve never caught him. Anyway, he gets into Blondie\u0027s room and wakes him up. Now he knows it isn\u0027t a trap, right?\" \"Right.\" \"So why does he kill Blondie?\" \"Maybe they quarrelled.\" \"There were no signs of a struggle.\" Harris frowned into his empty cup. \"Perhaps he realised that Blondie was being watched and he was afraid we\u0027d pick the boy up and make him spill the beans.\" Bloggs said, \"That makes him a ruthless bastard.\" \"That, too, might be why we\u0027ve never caught him.\" \"Come in. Sit down. I\u0027ve just had a call from MI6. Canaris has been fired.\" Bloggs went in, sat down, and said, \"Is that good news or bad?\" \"Very bad,\" said Godliman. \"It\u0027s happened at the worst possible moment.\" \"Do I get told why?\" Godliman looked at him intently, then said, \"I think you need to know. At this moment we have forty double agents broadcasting to Hamburg false information about Allied plans for the invasion of France.\" Bloggs whistled. \"I didn\u0027t know it was quite that big. I suppose the doubles say we\u0027re going in at Cherbourg, but really it will be Calais, or vice versa.\" \"Something like that. Apparently I don\u0027t need to know the details. Anyway they haven\u0027t told me. However, the whole thing is in danger. We knew Canaris; we knew we had him fooled; we felt we could have gone on fooling him. A new broom may mistrust his predecessor\u0027s agents. There\u0027s more: we\u0027ve had some defections from the other side, people who could have betrayed the Abwehr\u0027s people over here if they hadn\u0027t been betrayed already. It\u0027s another reason for the Germans to begin to suspect our doubles. Then there\u0027s the possibility of a leak. Literally thousands of people now know about the double-cross system. There are doubles in Iceland, Canada, and Ceylon. We ran a double-cross in the Middle East. \"And we made a bad mistake last year by repatriating a German called Erich Carl. We later learned he was an Abwehr agent-a real one-and that while he was in internment on the Isle of Man he may have learned about two doubles, Mutt and Jeff, and possibly a third called Tate. \"So we\u0027re on thin ice. If one decent Abwehr agent in Britain gets to know about Fortitude-that\u0027s the code name for the deception plan-the whole strategy will be endangered. Not to mince words, we could lose the fucking war.\" Bloggs suppressed a smile; he could remember a time when Professor Godliman did not know the meaning of such words. The professor went on, \"The Twenty Committee has made it quite clear that they expect me to make sure there aren\u0027t any decent Abwehr agents in Britain.\" \"Last week we would have been quite confident that there weren\u0027t,\" Bloggs said. \"Now we know there\u0027s at least one.\" \"And we let him slip through our fingers.\" \"So now we have to find him again.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Bloggs said gloomily. \"We don\u0027t know what part of the country he\u0027s operating from, we haven\u0027t the faintest idea what he looks like. He\u0027s too crafty to be pinpointed by triangulation while he\u0027s transmitting otherwise we would have nabbed him long ago. We don\u0027t even know his code name. So where do we start?\" \"Unsolved crimes,\" said Godliman. \"Look, a spy is bound to break the law. He forges papers, he steals petrol and ammunition, he evades checkpoints, he enters restricted areas, he takes photographs, and when people rumble him he kills them. The police are bound to get to know of some of these crimes if the spy has been operating for any length of time. If we go through the unsolved crimes files since the war, we\u0027ll find traces.\" \"Don\u0027t you realise that most crimes are unsolved?\" Bloggs said incredulously. \"The files would fill the Albert Hall!\" Godliman shrugged. \"So, we narrow it down to London, and we start with murders.\" They found what they were looking for on the very first day of their search. It happened to be Godliman who came across it, and at first he did not realise its significance. It was the file on the murder of a Mrs Una Garden in Highgate in 1940. Her throat had been cut and she had been sexuallv molested, although not raped. She had been found in the bedroom of her lodger, with considerable alcohol in her bloodstream. The picture was fairly clear: she had had a tryst with the lodger, he had wanted to go further than she was prepared to let him, they had quarrelled, he had killed her, and the murder had neutralised his libido. But the police had never found the lodger. Godliman had been about to pass over the file-spies did not get involved in sexual assaults. But he was a meticulous man with records, so he read every word, and consequently discovered that the unfortunate Mrs Garden had received stiletto wounds in her back as well as the fatal wound to her throat. Godliman and Bloggs were on opposite sides of a wooden table in the records room at Old Scotland Yard. Godliman tossed the file across the table and said, \"I think this is it.\" Bloggs glanced through it and said, \"The stiletto.\" They signed for the file and walked the short distance to the War Office. When they returned to Godliman\u0027s room, there was a decoded signal on his desk. He read it casually, then thumped the table in excitement. \"It\u0027s him!\" Bloggs read: \"Orders received. Regards to Willi.\" \"Remember him?\" Godliman said. \"Die Nadel?\" \"Yes,\" Bloggs said hesitantly. \"The Needle. But there\u0027s not much information here.\" \"Think, think! A stiletto is like a needle. It\u0027s the same man: the murder of Mrs Garden, all those signals in 1940 that we couldn\u0027t trace, the rendezvous with Blondie...\" \"Possibly.\" Bloggs looked thoughtful. \"I can prove it,\" Godliman said. \"Remember the transmission about Finland that you showed me the first day I came here? The one that was interrupted?\" \"Yes.\" Bloggs went to the file to find it. \"If my memory serves me well, the date of that transmission is the same as the date of this murder... and I\u0027ll bet the time of death coincides with the interruption.\" Bloggs looked at the signal in the file. \"Right both times.\" \"There!\" \"He\u0027s been operating in London for at least five years, and it\u0027s taken us until now to get on to him,\" Bloggs reflected. \"He won\u0027t be easy to catch.\" Godliman suddenly looked wolfish. \"He may be clever, but he\u0027s not as clever as me,\" he said tightly. \"I am going to nail him to the fucking wall.\" Bloggs laughed out loud. \"My God, you\u0027ve changed, Professor.\" Godliman said, \"Do you realise that\u0027s the first time you\u0027ve laughed for a year?\" The supply boat rounded the headland and chugged into the bay at Storm Island under a blue sky. There were two women in it: one was the skipper\u0027s wife-he had been called up and now she ran the business-and the other was Lucy\u0027s mother. Mother got out of the boat wearing a utility suit, a mannish jacket, and an above-the-knee skirt. Lucy hugged her mightily. \"Mother! What a surprise!\" \"But I wrote to you.\" The letter was with the mail on the boat; Mother had forgotten that the post only came once a fortnight on Storm Island. \"Is this my grandson? Isn\u0027t he a big boy?\" Little Jo, almost three years old, turned bashful and hid behind Lucy\u0027s skirt. He was dark-haired, pretty, and tall for his age. Mother said: \"Isn\u0027t he like his father!\" \"Yes,\" Lucy said \"You must be freezing. Come up to the house. Where did you get that skirt?\" They picked up the groceries and began to walk up the ramp to the cliff top. Mother chattered as they went. \"It\u0027s the fashion, dear. It saves on material. But it isn\u0027t as cold as this on the mainland. Such a wind! I suppose it\u0027s all right to leave my case on the jetty-nobody to steal it! Jane is engaged to an American soldier-a white one, thank God. He comes from a place called Milwaukee, and he doesn\u0027t chew gum. Isn\u0027t that nice? I\u0027ve only got four more daughters to marry off now. Your father is a Captain in the Home Guard, did I tell you? He\u0027s up half the night patrolling the common waiting for German parachutists. Uncle Stephen\u0027s warehouse was bombed-I don\u0027t know what he\u0027ll do, it\u0027s an Act of War or something-\" \"Don\u0027t rush, Mother, you\u0027ve got fourteen days to tell me the news,\" Lucy laughed. They reached the cottage. Mother said, \"Isn\u0027t this lovely?\" They went in. \"I think this is just lovely.\" Lucy parked Mother at the kitchen table and made tea. \"Tom will get your case up. He\u0027ll be here for his lunch shortly.\" \"The shepherd?\" \"Yes.\" \"Does he find things for David to do, then?\" Lucy laughed. \"It\u0027s the other way round. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll tell you all about it himself. You haven\u0027t told me why you\u0027re here.\" \"My dear, it\u0027s about time I saw you. I know you\u0027re not supposed to make unnecessary journeys, but once in four years isn\u0027t extravagant, is it?\" They heard the jeep outside, and a moment later David wheeled himself in. He kissed his mother-in-law and introduced Tom. Lucy said \"Tom, you can earn your lunch today by bringing Mother\u0027s case up, as she carried your groceries.\" David was warming his hands at the stove. \"It\u0027s raw today.\" \"You\u0027re really taking sheep-farming seriously, then?\" Mother said. \"The flock is double what it was three years ago,\" David told her. \"My father never farmed this island seriously. I\u0027ve fenced miles of the cliff top, improved the grazing, and introduced modern breeding methods. Not only do we have more sheep, but each animal gives us more meat and wool.\" Mother said tentatively, \"I suppose Tom does the physical work and you give the orders.\" David laughed. \"Equal partners, Mother.\" They had hearts for lunch, and both men ate mountains of potatoes. Mother commented favourably on Jo\u0027s table manners. Afterwards David lit a cigarette and Tom stuffed his pipe. Mother said, \"What I really want to know is when you\u0027re going to give us more grandchildren.\" She smiled brightly. There was a long silence. \"Well, I think it\u0027s wonderful, the way David copes,\" said Mother. Lucy said, \"Yes.\" They were walking along the cliff top. The wind had dropped on the third day of Mother\u0027s visit and it was mild enough to go out. They took Jo, dressed in a fisherman\u0027s sweater and a fur coat. They had stopped at the top of a rise to watch David, Tom, and the dog herding sheep. Lucy could see in Mother\u0027s face an internal struggle between concern and discretion. She decided to save her mother the effort of asking. \"He doesn\u0027t love me,\" she said. Mother looked quickly to make sure Jo was out of earshot. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not that bad, dear. Different men show their love in diff-\" \"Mother, we haven\u0027t been man and wife properly since we were married.\" \"But?...\" She indicated Jo with a nod. \"That was a week before the wedding.\" \"Oh! Oh, dear. Is it, you know, the accident?\" \"Yes, but not in the way you mean. It\u0027s nothing physical. He just... won\u0027t.\" Lucy was crying quietly, the tears trickling down her wind-browned cheeks. \"Have you talked about it?\" \"I\u0027ve tried.\" \"Perhaps with time...\" \"It\u0027s been almost four years!\" There was a pause. They began to walk on across the heather, into the weak afternoon sun. Jo chased gulls. Mother said, \"I almost left your father, once.\" It was Lucy\u0027s turn to be shocked. \"When?\" \"It was soon after Jane was born. We weren\u0027t so well-off in those days, you know Father was still working for his father, and there was a slump. I was expecting for the third time in three years, and it seemed that a life of having babies and making ends meet stretched out in front of me with nothing to relieve the monotony. Then I discovered he was seeing an old flame of his-Brenda Simmonds. You never knew her, she went to Basingstoke. Suddenly I asked myself what I was doing it for, and I couldn\u0027t think of a sensible answer.\" Lucy had dim, patchy memories of those days: her grandfather with a white moustache, her father in a more slender edition; extended family meals in the great farmhouse kitchen; a lot of laughter and sunshine and animals. Even then her parents\u0027 marriage had seemed to represent solid contentment, happy permanence. She said, \"Why didn\u0027t you? Leave, I mean.\" \"Oh, people just didn\u0027t, in those days. There wasn\u0027t all this divorce, and a woman couldn\u0027t get a job.\" \"Women work at all sorts of things now.\" \"They did in the last war, but everything changed afterward with a bit of unemployment. I expect it will be the same this time. Men get their way, you know, generally speaking.\" \"And you\u0027re glad you stayed.\" It was not a question. \"People my age shouldn\u0027t make pronouncements about life. But my life has been a matter of making-do, and the same goes for most of the women I know. Steadfastness always looks like a sacrifice, but usually it isn\u0027t. Anyway, I\u0027m not going to give you advice. You wouldn\u0027t take it, and if you did you\u0027d blame your problems on me, I expect.\" \"Oh, Mother,\" Lucy smiled.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle/page-6.html","bookId":2679,"book":{"id":2679,"title":"Eye Of The Needle","description":"Storyline: One enemy spy knows the secret to the Allies\u0027 greatest deception, a brilliant aristocrat and ruthless assassin -- code name: \"The Needle\" -- who holds the key to ultimate Nazi victory.
