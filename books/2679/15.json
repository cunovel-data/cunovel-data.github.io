{"id":68063,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Good. Let me know... Meanwhile, I\u0027ll pass the news to the Yard. Thank you, Dalkeith.\"\n \"We\u0027ll keep In touch. Good-bye, sir.\"\n Godliman put the phone on the hook and went into his study. He sat down with an atlas open to the road map of northern Britain. London, Liverpool, Carlisle, Stirling... Faber was heading for northeast Scotland.\n Godliman wondered whether he should reconsider the theory that Faber was trying to get out. The best way out was west, via neutral Eire. Scotland\u0027s east coast, however, was the site of all sorts of military activity. Was it possible that Faber had the nerve to continue his reconnaissance, knowing that M15 was on his tail? It was possible, Godliman decided-he knew Faber had a lot of guts-but nevertheless unlikely. Nothing the man might discover in Scotland could be as important as the information he already had.\n Therefore Faber was getting out via the east coast. Godliman ran over the methods of escape which were open to the spy: a light plane, landing on a lonely moor; a one-man voyage across the North Sea in a stolen vessel; a rendezvous with a U-boat, as Bloggs had speculated, off the coast; a passage in a merchant ship via a neutral country to the Baltic, disembarking in Sweden and crossing the border to occupied Norway... there were too many ways.\n In any case the Yard must be told of the latest development. They would ask all Scots police forces to try to find someone who had picked up a hitchhiker outside Stirling. Godliman returned to the living room to phone, but the instrument rang before he got there. He picked it up. \"Godliman speaking.\"\n \"A Mr Richard Porter is calling from Aberdeen.\"\n \"Oh!\" Godliman had been expecting Bloggs to check in from Carlisle. \"Put him on, please. Hello? Godliman speaking.\"\n \"Ah, Richard Porter here. I\u0027m on the local Watch Committee up here.\"\n \"Yes, what can I do for you?\"\n \"Well, actually, old boy, it\u0027s terribly embarrassing.\" Godliman controlled his impatience. \"Go on.\"\n \"This chappie you\u0027re looking for-knife murders and so on. Well, I\u0027m pretty sure I gave the bally fellow a lift in my own car.\"\n Godliman gripped the receiver more tightly. \"When?\"\n \"Night before last. My car broke down on the A80 just outside Stirling. Middle of the bally night. Along comes this chappie, on foot, and mends it, just like that. So naturally-\"\n \"Where did you drop him?\"\n \"Right here in Aberdeen. Said he was going on to Banff. Thing is, I slept most of yesterday, so it wasn\u0027t until this afternoon-\"\n \"Don\u0027t reproach yourself, Mr Porter. Thank you for calling.\"\n \"Well, good-bye.\"\n Godliman jiggled the receiver and the War Office operator came back on the line. Godliman said: \"Get Mr Bloggs for me, would you? He\u0027s in Carlisle.\"\n \"He\u0027s holding on for you right now, sir.\"\n \"Good!\"\n \"Hello, Percy. What news?\"\n \"We\u0027re on his trail again, Fred. He was identified in a garage in Carlisle, and he abandoned the Morris just outside Stirling and hitched a lift to Aberdeen.\"\n \"Aberdeen!\"\n \"He must be trying to get out through the east door.\"\n \"When did he reach Aberdeen?\"\n \"Probably early yesterday morning.\"\n \"In that case he won\u0027t have had time to get out, unless he was very quick indeed. They\u0027re having the worst storm in living memory up here. It started last night and it\u0027s still going on. No ships are going out and it\u0027s certainly too rough to land a plane.\"\n \"Good. Get up there as fast as you can. I\u0027ll start the local police moving in the meantime. Call me when you reach Aberdeen.\"\n \"I\u0027m on my way.\"\n When Faber woke up it was almost dark. Through the bedroom window he could see the last streaks of grey being inked out of the sky by the encroaching night. The storm had not eased; rain drummed on the roof and overflowed from a gutter, and the wind howled and gusted tirelessly.\n He switched on the little lamp beside the bed. The effort tired him, and he slumped back onto the pillow. It frightened him to be this weak. Those who believe that might is right must always be mighty, and Faber was sufficiently self-aware to know the implications of his own ethics. Fear was never far from the surface of his emotions; perhaps that was why he had survived so long. He was chronically incapable of feeling safe. He understood, in that vague way in which one sometimes understands the most fundamental things about oneself, that his very insecurity was the reason he chose the profession of spy; it was the only way of life which could permit him instantly to kill anyone who posed him the slightest threat. The fear of being weak was part of the syndrome that included his obsessive independence, his insecurity, and his contempt for his military superiors.\n He lay on the child\u0027s bed in the pink-walled bedroom and inventoried his body. He seemed to be bruised just about everywhere, but apparently nothing was broken. He did not feel feverish; his constitution had withstood bronchial infection despite the night on the boat. There was just the weakness. He suspected it was more than exhaustion. He remembered a moment, as he had reached the top of the ramp, when he had thought he was going to die; and he wondered whether he had inflicted on himself some permanent damage with the last mind-bending uphill dash.\n He checked his possessions too. The can of photographic negatives was still taped to his chest, the stiletto was strapped to his left arm, and his papers and money were in the jacket pocket of his borrowed pyjamas.\n He pushed the blankets aside and swung himself into a sitting position with his feet on the floor. A moment of dizziness came and went. He stood up. It was important not to permit himself the psychological attitudes of an invalid. He put on the dressing gown and went into the bathroom.\n When he returned his own clothes were at the foot of the bed, clean and pressed: underwear, overalls, and shirt. Suddenly he remembered getting up sometime during the morning and seeing the woman naked in the bathroom; it had been an odd scene and he was not sure what it meant. She was very beautiful, he recalled. He was sure of that.\n He dressed slowly. He would have liked a shave, but he decided to ask his host\u0027s permission before borrowing the blade on the bathroom shelf; some men were as possessive of their razors as they were of their wives. However, he did take the liberty of using the child\u0027s bakelite comb he found in the top drawer of the chest.\n He looked into the mirror without pride. He had no conceit. He knew that some women found him attractive, and others did not; and he assumed this was so for most men. Of course, he had had more women than most men, but he attributed this to his appetite, not to his looks. His reflection told him he was presentable, which was all he needed to know.\n He left the bedroom and went slowly down the stairs. Again he felt a wave of weakness; and again he willed himself to overcome it, gripping the bannister rail and placing one foot deliberately before the other until he reached the ground floor.\n He paused outside the living room door and, hearing no noise, went on to the kitchen. He knocked and went in. The young couple were at the table, finishing supper.\n The woman stood up when he entered. \"You got up!\" she said. \"Are you sure you should?\"\n Faber permitted himself to be led to a chair. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"You really mustn\u0027t encourage me to pretend to be ill.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think you realise what a terrible experience you\u0027ve been through,\" she said. \"Do you feel like food?\"\n \"I\u0027m imposing on you-\"\n \"Not at all. Don\u0027t be silly. I kept some soup hot for you.\"\n Faber said, \"You\u0027re so kind, and I don\u0027t even know your names.\"\n \"David and Lucy Rose.\" She ladled soup into a bowl and placed it on the table in front of him. \"Cut some bread, David, would you?\"\n \"I\u0027m Henry Baker.\" Faber did not know why he had said that, he had no papers in that name. Henry Faber was the man the police were hunting, so he was right to have used his James Baker identity; but somehow he wanted this woman to call him Henry, the nearest English equivalent of his real name, Heinrich.\n He took a sip of the soup, and suddenly he was ravenously hungry. He ate it all quickly, then the bread. When he\u0027d finished Lucy laughed. She looked lovely when she laughed; her mouth opened wide, showing lots of even white teeth, and her eyes crinkled merrily at the corners. \"More?\" she offered.\n \"Thank you very much.\"\n \"I can see it doing you good. The colour is coming back to your cheeks.\"\n Faber realised he felt physically better. He forced himself to eat his second helping more slowly, out of courtesy, but he still relished it.\n David said, \"How did you happen to be out in this storm?\" It was the first time he had spoken.\n \"Don\u0027t badger him, David...\"\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Faber said quickly. \"I was foolish, that\u0027s all. This is the first fishing holiday I\u0027ve been able to have since before the war, and I just refused to let the weather spoil it. Are you a fisherman?\"\n David shook his head. \"Sheep farmer.\"\n \"Do you have many employees?\"\n \"Just one, old Tom.\"\n \"I suppose there are other sheep farms on the island.\"\n \"No. We live at this end, Tom lives at the other end, and in between there\u0027s nothing but sheep.\"\n Faber nodded. Good, very good. A woman, a cripple, a child, and an old man... and he was already feeling much stronger. \"How do you contact the mainland?\" Faber said.\n \"There\u0027s a boat once a fortnight. It\u0027s due this Monday but it won\u0027t come if the storm keeps up. There\u0027s a radio transmitter in Tom\u0027s cottage, but we can only use that in emergencies. If I thought people might be searching for you, or if you needed urgent medical help, I should use it. But as things are I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s necessary. There\u0027s little point; nobody can come to fetch you off the island until the storm clears and when that happens the boat will come anyway.\"\n \"Of course.\" Faber\u0027s tone concealed his delight. The problem of how to contact the U-boat on Monday had been nagging at the back of his mind. He had seen an ordinary wireless set in the Roses\u0027 living room, and he would, if necessary, have been able to rig up a transmitter from that. But the fact that this Tom had a proper radio made everything so much simpler... \"What does Tom need a transmitter for?\"\n \"He\u0027s a member of the Royal Observer Corps. Aberdeen was bombed in July of 1940. There was no air raid warning. There were fifty casualties. That was when they recruited Tom. It\u0027s a good thing his hearing is better than his eyesight.\"\n \"I suppose the bombers come from Norway.\"\n \"I suppose so.\" Lucy stood up. \"Let\u0027s go into the other room.\"\n The two men followed her. Faber felt no weakness, no dizziness. He held the living room door for David, who wheeled himself close to the fire. Lucy offered Faber brandy. He declined. She poured one for her husband and herself.\n Faber sat back and allowed himself to study them.\n Lucy was really quite striking: she had an oval face, wide-set eyes of an unusual, cat-like amber colour and an abundance of rich, dark-red hair. Under the mannish fisherman\u0027s sweater and baggy trousers there was the suggestion of her very good, fullish figure. Dressed up in silk stockings and, say, a cocktail sort of dress, she might be very glamorous. David was also handsome; almost pretty, except for the shadow of a very dark beard. His hair was nearly black and his skin looked Mediterranean. He would have been tall if he had had legs in proportion to his arms. Faber suspected that those arms might be powerful, muscled from years of pushing the wheels of the chair.\n An attractive couple; but there was something badly wrong between them. Faber was no expert on marriage, but his training in interrogation techniques had taught him to read the silent language of the body to know, from small gestures, when someone was frightened, confident, hiding something, or lying. Lucy and David rarely looked at one another, and never touched. They spoke to him more than to each other. They circled one another, like turkeys trying to keep in front of them a few square feet of vacant territory. The tension between them was enormous. They were like Churchill and Stalin, obliged temporarily to fight side by side, fiercely suppressing a deeper enmity. Faber wondered what the trauma was that lay at the back of their distance. This cosy little house must be an emotional pressure cooker, despite its rugs and its bright paintwork, its floral armchairs and blazing fires and framed watercolours.\n To live alone, with only an old man and a child for company, with this thing between them... it reminded him of a play he had seen in London, by an American called Tennessee something-\n Abruptly, David swallowed his drink and said, \"I must turn in. My back\u0027s playing up.\" Faber got to his feet. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve been keeping you up.\" David waved him down. \"Not at all. You\u0027ve been asleep all day-you won\u0027t want to go back to bed right away. Besides, Lucy would like to chat, I\u0027m sure. It\u0027s just that I mistreat my back-backs were designed to share the load with the legs, you know.\"\n Lucy said, \"You\u0027d better take two pills tonight then.\" She took a bottle from the top shelf of the bookcase, shook out two tablets and gave them to her husband.\n He swallowed them dry. \"I\u0027ll say good night.\" He wheeled himself out.\n \"Good night, David.\"\n \"Good night, Mr Rose.\"\n After a moment Faber heard David dragging himself up the stairs, and wondered just how he did it.\n Lucy spoke, as if to cover the sound of David. \"Where do you live, Mr Baker?\"\n \"Please call me Henry. I live in London.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t been to London for years. There\u0027s probably not much of it left.\"\n \"It\u0027s changed, but not as much as you might think. When were you last there?\"\n \"Nineteen-forty.\" She poured herself another brandy. \"Since we came here, I\u0027ve only been off the island once, and that was to have the baby. One can\u0027t travel much these days, can one?\"\n \"What made you come here?\"\n \"Um.\" She sat down, sipped her drink, and looked into the fire.\n \"Perhaps I shouldn\u0027t-\"\n \"It\u0027s all right. We had an accident the day we got married. That\u0027s how David lost his legs. He\u0027d been training as a fighter pilot... we both wanted to run away, I think. I believe it was a mistake, but, as they say, it seemed like a good idea at the time.\"\n \"It\u0027s a reason for a healthy man to feel resentment.\"\n She gave him a sharp look. \"You\u0027re a perceptive man.\"\n \"It\u0027s obvious.\" He spoke very quietly. \"So is your unhappiness.\"\n She blinked nervously. \"You see too much.\"\n \"It\u0027s not difficult. Why do you continue, if it\u0027s not working?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know quite what to tell you.\"-or herself, for talking so openly to him. \"Do you want cliches? The way he was before... the vows of marriage... the child... the war... If there\u0027s another answer, I can\u0027t find good words for it.\"\n \"Maybe guilt,\" Faber said. \"But you\u0027re thinking of leaving him, aren\u0027t you?\"\n She stared at him, slowly shaking her head. \"How do you know so much?\"\n \"You\u0027ve lost the art of dissembling in four years on this island. Besides, these things are so much simpler from the outside.\"\n \"Have you ever been married?\"\n \"No. That\u0027s what I mean.\"\n \"Why not?... I think you ought to be.\"\n It was Faber\u0027s turn to look away, into the fire. Why not, indeed? His stock answer to himself was his profession. But of course he could not tell her that, and anyway it was too glib. \"I don\u0027t trust myself to love anyone that much.\" The words had come out without forethought-he was astonished to note-and he wondered whether they were true. A moment later he wondered how Lucy had got past his guard, when he had thought he was disarming her.\n Neither of them spoke for a while. The fire was dying. A few stray raindrops found their way down the chimney and hissed in the cooling coals. The storm showed no sign of letting up. Faber found himself thinking of the last woman he had had. What was her name? Gertrud. It was seven years ago, but he could picture her now in the flickering fire: a round German face, fair hair, green eyes, beautiful breasts, much-too-wide hips, fat legs, bad feet; the conversational style of an express train; a wild, inexhaustible enthusiasm for sex... She had flattered him, admiring his mind (she said) and adoring his body (she had no need to tell him). She wrote lyrics for popular songs, and read them to him in a poor basement flat in Berlin; it was not a lucrative profession. He visualised her now in that untidy bedroom, lying naked, urging him to do more bizarre and erotic things with her; to hurt her, to touch himself, to lie completely still while she made love to him... He shook his head slightly to brush away the memories. He had not thought like that in all the years he had been celibate. Such visions were disturbing. He looked at Lucy.\n \"You were far away,\" she said with a smile.\n \"Memories,\" he said. \"This talk of love...\"\n \"I shouldn\u0027t burden you.\"\n \"You\u0027re not.\"\n \"Good memories?\"\n \"Very good. And yours? You were thinking too.\"\n She smiled again. \"I was in the future, not the past.\"\n \"What do you see there?\"\n She seemed about to answer, then changed her mind. It happened twice. There were signs of tension about her eyes.\n \"I see you finding another man,\" Faber said. As he spoke he was thinking, Why am I doing this? \"He is a weaker man than David, and less handsome, but it\u0027s at least partly for his weakness that you love him. He\u0027s clever, but not rich; compassionate without being sentimental; tender, loving.\" The brandy glass in her hand shattered under the pressure of her grip. The fragments fell into her lap and onto the carpet, and she ignored them. Faber crossed to her chair and knelt in front of her. Her thumb was bleeding. He took her hand. \"You\u0027ve hurt yourself.\" She looked at him. She was crying. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said.\n The cut was superficial. She took a handkerchief from her trousers pocket and staunched the blood. Faber released her hand and began to pick up the pieces of broken glass, wishing he had kissed her when he\u0027d had the chance. He put the shards on the mantel. \"I didn\u0027t mean to upset you,\" he said. (Didn\u0027t he?)\n She took away the handkerchief and looked at her thumb. It was still bleeding. (Yes, you did. And, God knows, you have.) \"A bandage,\" he suggested. \"In the kitchen.\"\n He found a roll of bandage, a pair of scissors, and a safety pin. He filled a small bowl with hot water and returned to the living room.\n In his absence she had somehow obliterated the evidence of tears on her face. She sat passively, limp, while he bathed her thumb in the hot water, dried it, and put a small strip of bandage over the cut. She looked all the time at his face, not at his hands; but her expression was unreadable.\n He finished the job and stood back abruptly. This was silly: he had taken the thing too far. Time to disengage. \"I think I\u0027d better go to bed,\" he said.\n She nodded.\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Stop apologising,\" she told him. \"It doesn\u0027t suit you.\"\n Her tone was harsh. He guessed that she, too, felt the thing had got out of hand.\n \"Are you staying up?\" he asked. She shook her head.\n \"Well...\" He followed her through the hall and up the stairs, and he watched her climb, her hips moving gently.\n At the top of the stairs, on the tiny landing, she turned and said in a low voice, \"Good night.\"\n \"Good night, Lucy.\"\n She looked at him for a moment. He reached for her hand, but she turned quickly away, entering her bedroom and closing the door without a backward look, leaving him standing there, wondering what was in her mind and-more to the point-what was really in his.\n Bloggs drove dangerously fast through the night in a commandeered Sunbeam Talbot with a souped-up engine. The hilly, winding Scottish roads were slick with rain and, in a few low places, two or three inches deep in water. The rain drove across the windscreen in sheets. On the more exposed hilltops the gale-force winds threatened to blow the car off the road and into the soggy turf alongside. For mile after mile, Bloggs sat forward in the seat, peering through the small area of glass that was cleared by the wiper, straining his eyes to make out the shape of the road in front as the headlights battled with the obscuring rain. Just north of Edinburgh he ran over three rabbits, feeling the sickening bump as the tyres squashed their small bodies. He did not slow the car, but for a while afterward he wondered whether rabbits normally came out at night.\n The strain gave him a headache, and his sitting position made his back hurt. He also felt hungry.\n He opened the window for a cold breeze to keep him awake, but so much water came in that he was immediately forced to close it again. He thought about Die Nadel, or Faber or whatever he was calling himself now: a smiling young man in running shorts, holding a trophy. Well, so far Faber was winning this race.\n He was forty-eight hours ahead and he had the advantage that only he knew the route that had to be followed. Bloggs would have enjoyed a contest with that man, if the stakes had not been so high, so bloody high.\n He wondered what he would do if he ever came face to face with the man. I\u0027d shoot him out of hand, he thought, before he killed me. Faber was a pro, and you didn\u0027t mess with that type. Most spies were amateurs: frustrated revolutionaries of the left or right, people who wanted the imaginary glamour of espionage, greedy men or lovesick women or blackmail victims. The few professionals were very dangerous indeed; they were not merciful men.\n Dawn was still an hour or two away when Bloggs drove into Aberdeen. Never in his life had he been so grateful for street lights, dimmed and masked though they were. He had no idea where the police station was, and there was no one on the streets to give him direction so he drove around the town until he saw the familiar blue lamp (also dimmed).\n He parked the car and ran through the rain into the building. He was expected. Godliman had been on the phone, and Godliman was now very senior indeed. Bloggs was shown into the office of Alan Kincaid, a detective chief-inspector in his mid-fifties. There were three other officers in the room; Bloggs shook their hands and instantly forgot their names. Kincaid said: \"You made bloody good time from Carlisle.\"\n \"Nearly killed myself doing it,\" Bloggs replied, and sat down. \"If you can rustle up a sandwich...\"\n \"Of course.\" Kincaid leaned his head out of the door and shouted something. \"It\u0027ll be here in two shakes,\" he told Bloggs.\n The office had off-white walls, a plank floor, and plain hard furniture: a desk, a few chairs, and a filing cabinet. It was totally unrelieved: no pictures, no ornaments, no personal touches of any kind. There was a tray of dirty cups on the floor, and the air was thick with smoke. It smelled like a place where men had been working all night.\n Kincaid had a small moustache, thin grey hair and spectacles. A big intelligent-looking man in shirtsleeves and braces, he spoke with a local accent, a sign that, like Bloggs, he had come up through the ranks, though from his age it was clear that his rise had been slower than Bloggs\u0027.\n Bloggs said: \"How much do you know about all this?\"\n \"Not much,\" Kincaid said. \"But your governor, Godliman, did say that the London murders are the least of this man\u0027s crimes. We also know which department you\u0027re with, so we can put two and two together about this Faber...\"\n \"What have you done so far?\" Bloggs asked.\n Kincaid put his feet on his desk. \"He arrived here two days ago, right? That was when we started looking for him. We had the pictures- I assume every force in the country got them.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"We checked the hotels and lodging houses, the station and the bus depot. We did it quite thoroughly, although at the time we didn\u0027t know he had come here. Needless to say, we had no results. We\u0027re checking again, of course: but my opinion is that he probably left Aberdeen immediately.\"\n A woman police constable came in with a cup of tea and a very thick cheese sandwich. Bloggs thanked her and greedily set about the sandwich.\n Kincaid went on: \"We had a man at the railway station before the first train left in the morning. Same for the bus depot. So, if he left the town, either he stole a car or he hitched a ride. We\u0027ve had no stolen cars reported, so I figure he hitched-\"\n \"He might have gone by sea,\" Bloggs said through a mouthful of wholemeal bread.\n \"Of the boats that left the harbour that day, none was big enough to stow away on. Since then, of course, nothing\u0027s gone out because of the storm.\"\n \"Stolen boats?\"\n \"None reported.\"\n Bloggs shrugged. \"If there\u0027s no prospect of going out, the owners might not come to the harbour, in which case the theft of a boat might go unnoticed until the storm ends.\"\n One of the officers in the room said, \"We missed that one, chief.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle/page-15.html","bookId":2679,"book":{"id":2679,"title":"Eye Of The Needle","description":"Storyline: \n One enemy spy knows the secret to the Allies\u0027 greatest deception, a brilliant aristocrat and ruthless assassin -- code name: \"The Needle\" -- who holds the key to ultimate Nazi victory. \n Only one person stands in his way: a lonely Englishwoman on an isolated island, who is beginning to love the killer who has mysteriously entered her life. \n All will come to a terrifying conclusion in Ken Follett\u0027s unsurpassed and unforgettable masterwork of suspense, intrigue, and the dangerous machinations of the human heart.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/eye-of-the-needle.jpg","author":"Ken Follett","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM"}}
