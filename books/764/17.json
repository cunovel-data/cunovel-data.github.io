{"id":27157,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XV. ILLUSTRATIVE EXERCISES","content":"1. All men possessed of an uncontrolled discretionary power, leading to the aggrandisement and profit of their own body, have always abused it.\u0027—Burke\u0027s Thoughts on the Present Discontents. The student will find the proof of this proposition exhibited in the example of Induction, quoted from Mr. Bailey, p. 63. 2. Prosperity could never be reached and maintained in this country, without some provision for the regular employment of the poor.—Mr. Beckett\u0027s Speech in the House of Commons, Feb. 3,1842. The demonstration, to universal conviction, of this proposition, would lead to an entire and beneficial change of the social condition of this country. 3. The pen is the tongue of the world.—Paine. Put this in the syllogistic form. 4. A good instance of a metaphorical argument drawn out is given by Mr. Mill:—\u0027For instance, when Mr. Carlyle, rebuking the Byronic vein, says that \"strength does not manifest itself in spasms, but in stout bearing of burdens;\" the metaphor proves nothing, it is no argument, only an allusion to an argument; in no other way however could so much of argument be so completely suggested in so few words. The expression suggests a whole train of reasoning, which it would take many sentences to write out at length. As thus: Motions which are violent but brief, which lead to no end, and are not under the control of the will, are, in the physical body, more incident to a weak than to a strong constitution. If this be owing to a cause which equally operates in what relates to the mind, the same conclusion will told there likewise. But such is really the fact. For the body\u0027s liability to these sudden and uncontrollable motions arises from irritability, that is, unusual susceptibility of being moved out of its ordinary course by transient influences: which may equally be said of the mind. And this susceptibility, whether of mind or body, must arise from a weakness of the forces which maintain and carry on the ordinary action of the system. All this is conveyed in one short sentence. And since the causes are alike in the body and in the mind, the analogy is a just one, and the maxim holds of the one as much as of the other.\u0027* * Logic, pp. 433-4, vol. 2. 5. A youth, named Evathlus, engaged with Protagoras to learn dialectics, and promised his tutor a large sum of money, in case he gained the first cause he pleaded, Evathlus, when fully instructed, refused to pay his instructor. Protagoras brought his action thus—\u0027You must pay the money however the cause go, for if I gain you must pay in consequence of the sentence, as being cast in the cause; and if you gain it, you must pay in pursuance of our covenant.\u0027 \u0027Nay,\u0027 Evathlus retorts, \u0027which way soever the cause be decided, you will have nothing, for if I prevail, the sentence gives it that nothing is due: and if I lose, then there is nothing due by the covenant.\u0027 What should be the decision in this case? 6. The first case, says Cervantes, requiring Sancho\u0027s attention was a question put by a stranger, in presence of the stewards and rest of the attendants. \u0027My Lord,\u0027 said he, \u0027a certain manor is divided by a large river. I beg your honour will be attentive, for the case is of great consequence and of some difficulty. I say then, upon this river is a bridge, and at one end of it the gibbet, together with a sort of court hall, in which four judges usually sit to execute the law enacted by the lord of the river, bridge, and manor, which runs to this effect: Whoever shall pass this bridge, must first swear whence he comes and whither he goes; if he swear the truth he shall be allowed to pass, but if he forswear himself he shall die upon the gallows without mercy or respite. This law, together with the rigorous penalty, being known, numbers passed, and as it appeared they swore nothing but the truth, the judges permitted them to pass freely and without control. It happened, however, that one man\u0027s oath being taken, he affirmed and swore by his deposition that he was going to be hanged on that gibbet, and had no other errand or intention. The judges, having considered this oath, observed: if we allow this man to pass freely, he swore to a lie, and, therefore, ought to be hanged according to law; and if we ordered him to be hanged after he hath sworn he was going to be suspended on that gibbet, he will have sworn the truth, and by the same law he ought to be acquitted, I beg, therefore, to know, my lord governor [and student], what the judges must do with this man?\u0027 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3199/87433.html","bookId":764,"book":{"id":764,"title":"A Logic Of Facts","description":"简介： It is a humiliating reflection that mankind never reasoned so ill as when they most professed to cultivate the art of reasoning.Life of Galileo, p. 1. society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3199","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:16 AM"}}
