{"id":7684,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 2 A Really Useless Attitude","content":"Any two people can have wildly different attitudestoward the same set of experiences. However, whentwo people react to the same experience with the sameattitude, they share a powerful natural bond. Attitudeshave the tendency to be infectious, and because theyare rooted in emotional interpretation of experiences,they can be distorted and shaped; they can be woundup or wound down. \\n\\n \\n\\n What happens when people lose control and becomeangry? They look belligerent (body language), theirvoice tone is harsh and they use menacing words. Theycan be very scary to be around. From the point of viewof making people like you, or even getting willing cooperation,we call this a Really Useless Attitude. How oftenhave you seen infuriated parents berating their childrenfor knocking over the bananas at the supermarket? Orbored, uninterested shop assistants? Or cranky, impatientdoctors? They are all putting out useless attitudes. \\n\\n \\n\\n 37how to make people like youI\u0027m not saying whether this is right or wrong; I\u0027m justpointing out that from a communications standpoint itdoesn\u0027t deliver the message very well. Assuming theyhave a message. And that\u0027s often the point. Useless attitudestend to come from people who don\u0027t know whatthey really want from their communication. \\n\\n \\n\\n Remember, the \"K\" in \"KFC\" stands for \"Knowwhat you want.\" If you don\u0027t know what youwant, there\u0027s no message to deliver and no basisfor connecting with other people. \\n\\n \\n\\n Most people think in terms of what they don\u0027t wantas opposed to what they do want, and their attitudesreflect this. \"I don\u0027t want my boss yelling at me anymore\"comes with a whole different attitude than \"1 wantmy boss\u0027s job\" or \"I want to be promoted.\" Similarly, \"I\u0027msick of selling neckties all day long\" sends a completelydifferent attitude and set of signals to your imaginationthan does \"I want to run a charter fishing boat in HoneyHarbor.\"Your imagination is the strongest force that youpossess—stronger than willpower. Think about it. Yourimagination projects sensory experiences in your mindthrough the language of pictures, sounds, feelings,smells and tastes. Your imagination distorts reality. Itcan work for you or against you. It can make you feel38terrific or miserable. So the better the information youcan feed into your imagination, the better it can organizeyour thinking and your attitudes and ultimately your life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28315.html","bookId":253,"book":{"id":253,"title":"90秒内赢得好感 How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less","description":"简介： The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams 励志英语小说原版英语版，PDF格式...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201311/28/13-23-45-53-1.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:27 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:27 AM"}}
