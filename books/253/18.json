From time to time, someone I\u0027ve neverheard of before sends me a letter (spelling my namewrong) to tell me what a pleasure it is to have me as aspecial customer. No matter how hard they try toimprove their \"personalized\" service, however, banksare pretty much the same all over, and my bank is reallyno different from the rest. So why do I still bank thereeven though two new, competing banks have recentlyopened much closer to where I live? Convenience? \n \n Obviously not. Better rates? Nope. More services? No. \n \n It\u0027s none of these things. It\u0027s Joanne, one of the tellers. \n \n What does Joanne offer that the institution can\u0027t? Shemakes me feel good. I believe she cares about me, andother customers feel the same way about her. You cantell by the way they talk with her. This charming ladybrightens up the whole place. \n \n How does Joanne do it? Simple. She knows what shewants: to please the customers and do her job well. Shehas a Really Useful Attitude or, to be more precise, twofully congruent Really Useful Attitudes.
