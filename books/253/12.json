{"id":7677,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 4 Communicating","content":"Everyone seems to have a different sense of the word\"communication,\" but the definitions usually gosomething like this: \"It\u0027s an exchange of informationbetween two or more people\" . . . \"It\u0027s getting your messageacross\" ... \"It\u0027s being understood.\"In the early days of Neuro-Linguistic Programming(NLP), a research project devoted to \"the study of excellenceand a model of how individuals structure their subjectivesensory experience,\" Richard Bandler and JohnGrinder created an effective definition: \"The meaning of20communication lies in the response it gets.\" This is simple,and brilliant, because it means that it\u0027s 100% up toyou whether or not your own communication succeeds. \\n\\n \\n\\n After all, you axe the one with a message to deliver or agoal to achieve, and you are the one with the responsibilityto make it happen. What\u0027s more, if it doesn\u0027t work, youare the one with the flexibility to change what you do untilyou finally get what you want. In order to give some formand function to communication here, let\u0027s assume that wehave some kind of response or outcome in mind. Peoplewho are low on communication skills usually have notthought out the response they want from the other personin the first place and therefore cannot aim for it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The skills you will learn here will serve you on all levelsof communication from social dealings like developingnew relationships and being understood in your dailyinteractions all the way to life-changing moves for yourselfand those in your sphere of influence. \\n\\n \\n\\n The formula for effective communication has threedistinct parts: \\n\\n \\n\\n Know what you want. Formulate your intention in theaffirmative and preferably in the present tense. Forexample, \"I want a successful relationship, I have filledmy imagination with what that relationship will look,sound, feel, smell and taste like with me in it, and I knowwhen I will have it\" is an affirmative statement, asopposed to \"I don\u0027t want to be lonely.\"21Find out what you\u0027re getting. Get feedback. You findthat hanging out in smoky bars is not for you. \\n\\n \\n\\n Change what you do until you get what you want. \\n\\n \\n\\n Design a plan and follow through with it: \"I\u0027ll invite 10people over for dinner every Saturday night.\" Do it andget more feedback. Redesign if necessary, and do it againwith more feedback. Repeat the cycle—redesign-do-getfeedback—until you get what you want. You can applythis cycle to any area of your life that you want toimprove—finance, romance, sports, career, you name it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Know what you want. \\n\\n \\n\\n Find out what you\u0027re getting. \\n\\n \\n\\n Change what you do until you get what you want. \\n\\n \\n\\n This is terrifically easy to remember because acertain Colonel had the good sense to open achain of restaurants using the abbreviation KFCfor a name. Every time we see one of his signs,we can ask ourselves how well the developmentof our communication skills is going. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n What\u0027s Coming Up ... \\n\\n \\n\\n IIn the following chapters, we\u0027ll examine the arena ofrapport in much more detail, as well as the value of aReally Useful Attitude in projecting a positive image of22yourself. You\u0027ll learn what happens at first sight on thesurface and below the surface and the importance ofhaving your body language, your voice tone and yourwords be congruent, or all saying the same thing. Nocrossed signals, no mixed messages, no confusion. \\n\\n \\n\\n You\u0027ll discover how your body language appeals tosome but not others and how, by making a few adjustmentsto your own movements, you can positively affectthe way people feel about you. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then we\u0027ll delve deep into the warm and welcomingworld of synchrony. You\u0027ll learn how to align yourselfwith the signals other people send you so that they\u0027llfeel a natural familiarity and comfort around you. We\u0027llalso discuss the massive importance of voice tone andhow it influences the moods and emotions we want toconvey. \\n\\n \\n\\n A whole chapter is devoted to starting and maintainingsparkling conversation. We\u0027ll explore all the ways toopen people up and avoid closing them down. We\u0027ll alsodeal with compliments, obtaining free information andbeing memorable. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally we\u0027ll go even deeper, down to the very coreof the human psyche. The astonishing truth is thatalthough we navigate the world through our five senses,each of us has one sense that we rely on more than theother four. I\u0027ll show you how people are giving cluesabout their favorite sense all the time and how you can23move onto the same sensory wavelength as theirs. Dopeople who rely mainly on their ears differ from thosewho rely mainly on their eyes? Darn right they do, andyou\u0027ll find out how to tailor your approach to communicatewith them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Each chapter includes at least one exercise that willhelp you realize the power of connecting. Some of theseexercises can be done alone, but others you have to dowith a partner. Let\u0027s face it, face-to-face communicationand rapport skills are interactive activities—you can\u0027tlearn to do them all by yourself. \\n\\n \\n\\n So there it is. Connecting. All day long, men, womenand children give away vital keys to what makes themtick—to how they experience and filter the world—through their body language, their tone of voice, their eyemovements and their choice of words. They simply cannothelp doing this. Now it\u0027s up to you to learn how to usethis wonderful, nonstop flood of information to achieveimproved outcomes and more satisfying relationships. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28308.html","bookId":253,"book":{"id":253,"title":"90秒内赢得好感 How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less","description":"简介： The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams 励志英语小说原版英语版，PDF格式...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201311/28/13-23-45-53-1.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:27 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:27 AM"}}
