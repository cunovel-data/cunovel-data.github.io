Sometimes rapport just happens naturally and you\u0027ve no clue why, The job gets done, the conversation flows, the cop tears up theticket. But how often have you found yourself in asituation where, no matter how hard you try, youjust can\u0027t seem to connect with another person—and it makes no sense? After all, you know you\u0027re afine, decent human being. Maybe you\u0027re even a fabu-lous, wildly attractive human being. But no matterwhat you say or do, you don\u0027t establish rapport andyou can\u0027t connect. \\n\\n \\n\\n You\u0027re not alone. Being a decent sort is not enoughto guarantee good rapport with another person.

If these routines work outand rapport is established, we can begin to deliver ourcommunication with some certainty that it will beaccepted and given serious consideration. Seriousconsideration is vital because the fundamental outcomeof rapport is the perception of credibility, whichin turn will lead to mutual trust. If credibility is notestablished, the messenger and not the message maybecome the focus of attention, and that attention willharbor discomfort. \\n\\n \\n\\n But when we experience the world through the sameeyes, ears and feelings as others, we are so bonded, orsynchronized, with them that they can\u0027t help but knowwe understand them.

What happens in those 90 secondscan determine whether we succeed or fail at achievingrapport. In fact, frequently we have even less than 90seconds! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28309.html","bookId":253,"book":{"id":253,"title":"90秒内赢得好感 How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less","description":"简介： The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams 励志英语小说原版英语版，PDF格式...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201311/28/13-23-45-53-1.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:27 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:27 AM"}}
