{"id":93803,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Bed, she thought firmly. That other place is too cold. And then she was turning over, and she was in bed, pulling up the covers. Her brain was too foggy to think of calling to the others, of finding out if it really had been a shared dream. She just wanted to sleep. The next morning she woke up to: Oh, no. Lewis? she thought hazily. Hi, Kaitlyn. Hi, Rob. G\u0027way, Lewis. I\u0027m sleeping, Rob said indistinctly. Only, of course, he didn\u0027t say it, not with his voice. He was in his own bedroom, and so was Lewis. Kait could feel them there. She looked up over hummocks of sheets and blankets, to see Anna looking at her from the other bed. Anna looked flushed with sleep, sweet, and resigned. Hi, Anna, Kaitlyn said, feeling somewhat resigned herself. Hi, Kait. Hi, Anna, Lewis said chirpily. And good night, John-boy! Gabriel shouted from across the house. Shut the hell up, all of you! Anna and Kaitlyn shared a look. He\u0027s crabby when he wakes up, Kaitlyn observed. All boys are, Anna told her serenely. At least he seems to have got his strength back. I thought, Rob said, his mental voice seeming more awake, that you said it would be gone by this morning. Thunderous silence from Gabriel. We might as well get dressed, Kaitlyn said at last when the silence went on. It\u0027s almost seven. She found that if she concentrated on herself, the others receded into the background-which was just as well, she thought as she showered and dressed. There were some things you needed to be alone for. But no matter what she did, they were there. Lurking around the edges of her mind like friends just within earshot and shouting range. Paying attention to any one of them brought that one closer. Except Gabriel, who seemed to have locked himself off in a corner. Paying attention to him was like bouncing off the smoothness of his steely walls. It wasn\u0027t until she was dressed that Kaitlyn remembered her dream. \"Anna-last night-did you dream anything in particular?\" Anna looked up from beneath the glistening raven\u0027s wing of her dark hair. \"You mean about that place by the ocean?\" she said, brushing vigorously. She seemed quite undisturbed. Kaitlyn sat down. \"Then it was real. I mean, you were really there.\" You guys were all in my dream, she added silently, so the others could hear it. Well, it\u0027s not really that surprising, is it? Rob asked from his room. If our minds are linked telepathically, and one of us has a dream, maybe the others get dragged in. Kaitlyn shook her head. There\u0027s more to it than that, she told Rob-but what more, she didn\u0027t know. Just then Lewis interrupted anyway, from the stairway. Hey, I think Joyce is home! I hear somebody in the kitchen. Come on down! All thoughts of the dream vanished. Kaitlyn and Anna ran out and met Rob on their way to the staircase. \"Joyce!\" Lewis was saying when they got to the kitchen. He was also saying Joyce! but Joyce didn\u0027t seem to notice. \"Are you all right?\" Kaitlyn asked. Joyce looked very pale, and there were huge dark circles under her eyes. She looked . . . young, somehow, like a kid with a short haircut that\u0027s turned out wrong. Kaitlyn swallowed, but couldn\u0027t manage the next words. Anna said them for her. \"Is Marisol. . . ?\" Joyce put down a box of Shredded Wheat as if it were heavy. \"Marisol is ... stable.\" Then her adult control seemed to desert her and she blurted, lips trembling, \"She\u0027s in a coma.\" \"Oh, God,\" Kaitlyn whispered. \"The doctors are watching her. I stayed with her family at the hospital last night, but I didn\u0027t get to see her.\" Joyce fished in her purse, found a tissue, and blew her nose. She picked up the Shredded Wheat box and looked at it blankly. \"Now, you just let go of that and sit down,\" Rob said gently. \"We\u0027ll take care of everything.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Kaitlyn said, glad for the guidance. She herself felt sick and terrified. But doing something made her feel better, and in a few minutes they had Joyce sitting at the kitchen table, with Anna stroking her hand, Kaitlyn making coffee, and Rob and Lewis setting out bowls and spoons. \"It\u0027s all so confusing,\" Joyce said, wiping her eyes and crumpling the tissue in her fist. \"Marisol\u0027s family didn\u0027t know she was on medication. They didn\u0027t even know she\u0027d been seeing a psychiatrist. I had to tell them.\" Kaitlyn looked at Rob, who, shielded by the pantry door, returned the look with grim significance. Then, carefully measuring scoops of ground coffee, she asked Joyce, \"Who told you she was seeing a shrink?\" \"Who? Mr. Zetes.\" Joyce passed a hand over her forehead. \"By the way, he said you kids behaved really well last night. Went to bed early and all,\" Anna smiled. \"We\u0027re not children.\" She was the only one who could talk; the others were all engaged in a torrent of silent communication. I knew it, Kaitlyn was telling Rob. Joyce doesn\u0027t know anything about Marisol except what comes from Mr. Z. Don\u0027t you remember-when I asked about Marisol\u0027s medication, she told me, \"He said a psychiatrist prescribed it.\" It was Mr. Zetes who told her that. For all we know, Marisol wasn\u0027t on any medication at all. Rob\u0027s face was tight. And now she\u0027s in a coma because- Because she knew too much about what was going on here. What was really going on, Kait finished. Which you guys still haven\u0027t told us, Lewis reminded her. But look, why don\u0027t we tell Joyce what\u0027s going on? I mean, what\u0027s going on with us. She might know how this telepathy thing works-NO! The thought came like a clap of thunder from upstairs. Kaitlyn involuntarily glanced upward. Gabriel\u0027s mental voice was icily furious. We can\u0027t tell anyone-and especially not Joyce. \"Why not?\" Lewis said. It took Kaitlyn a moment to realize he\u0027d said it aloud. Anna was casting alarmed glances from the table. \"Uh, anybody want sugar or Equal or anything on their cereal?\" Rob interjected. Lewis, be careful! he added silently. \"Sugar,\" Lewis said, subdued. But why can\u0027t we tell Joyce? Don\u0027t you trust her? he added in what came across as a mental stage whisper. \"Equal,\" Kaitlyn said, to Rob. I do trust her-I think. I don\u0027t believe she knows anything-You idiot! You can\u0027t trust anyone, Gabriel snarled from upstairs. The volume of his thoughts was giving Kaitlyn a headache. Looking pained, Rob and Lewis sat down at the table. Kaitlyn poured Joyce a cup of coffee and joined them. The spoken and unspoken conversations formed an eerie counterpoint to each other. I hate to say this, but I think he\u0027s right, Rob said silently, when the echoes of Gabriel\u0027s forceful message had died. I want to trust Joyce, too-but she tells Mr. Zetes everything. She told him about Marisol, and look what happened. \"Everything\u0027s going to be all right,\" Anna told Joyce. She\u0027s very upset over Marisol. That\u0027s genuine, she told the others. She\u0027s an adult, Gabriel said flatly. You can\u0027t trust any adult, ever. And if she\u0027s innocent, she could get hurt, Rob added. \"If there\u0027s anything we can do to help Marisol, let us know,\" Kaitlyn said to Joyce. All right. We won\u0027t tell her, she conceded. But we need to get information about telepathy from somewhere. And we need to talk about what Rob and I found in that hidden room. Rob nodded, and covered it with a violent spasm of coughing. We\u0027d better meet at school-alone. Otherwise talking like this is going to drive me crazy. Kaitlyn felt agreement from everywhere, except upstairs. That means you, too, Gabriel, Rob said grimly. You\u0027re the one who started this. You\u0027re going to be there, boy. Aloud he said, \"Could somebody pass that orange juice, please?\" They met at lunch, and Kaitlyn and Rob told about everything they\u0027d found in Mr. Zetes\u0027s hidden office below the stairs. Anna and Lewis were as puzzled as Kait had been over the various files and papers. \"Psychoactive weaponry,\" Gabriel said, seeming to relish the words. By unanimous agreement they were all talking out loud, and Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t tell what Gabriel was thinking behind his barriers. \"Do you know what it means?\" Rob asked. His attitude toward Gabriel had changed overnight. There was a new tolerance in him-and a new combative-ness. Kaitlyn had the slightly alarmed feeling that he meant to push and challenge Gabriel whenever he thought it was good for Gabriel. \"Well, psychoactive should be obvious even to a moron,\" Gabriel said. \"It means something activated by psychics.\" As opposed to something activated by psychos? \"Lewis!\" Kaitlyn, Anna, and Rob all said. Gabriel contented himself with a withering look. \"I couldn\u0027t help it. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m not saying anything, see?\" Lewis took a desperate chug of milk. \"Something . . . activated ... by psychic power,\" Gabriel repeated coldly, one eye on Lewis. When there was no interruption, he turned to Rob. \"Do I have to explain weaponry, or can you manage that alone?\" Rob leaned forward. \"Why . . . would NASA ... want him ... to develop weaponry?\" Kaitlyn slammed a fork on the table between them to get their attention. \"Maybe NASA didn\u0027t want him to actually develop it-but to find out if somebody else could be developing it. Eighty-six was the year the Challenger shuttlecraft exploded, right? Well, what if NASA thought the explosion was, like, sabotage? Psychic sabotage?\" \"Sabotage by who?\" Rob asked quietly. \"I don\u0027t know-the old Soviet Union? Somebody else who didn\u0027t want the space program to go ahead? If you got psychics to develop PK that could work over really long distances, you could have them throw switches in the shuttlecraft while they were sitting here on earth. I know it\u0027s not a nice idea, but it\u0027s possible.\" \"We\u0027re not dealing with nice people,\" Anna said. \"Look, what about all the other things in that room?\" Lewis asked. \"The pilot study stuff, and the letter from the judge-\" \"Forget it. All of it,\" Gabriel said sharply, and when several people turned to protest, he added, Forget it! We\u0027ve got something else to worry about first. Understand? Kaitlyn nodded slowly. \"You\u0027re right. If this... web ... that connects us gets unstable ...\" \"Even if it doesn\u0027t, we\u0027ve got to get rid of it,\" Gabriel said brutally. \"And the only place to get information about telepathy-hard information, in detail-is the Institute.\" \"That\u0027s right, Joyce has a bunch of books and journals and things in the lab,\" Lewis said. \"But she\u0027s going to think it\u0027s weird that we\u0027re suddenly interested.\" \"Not if we go now,\" Gabriel said. \"She\u0027s probably asleep.\" \"She might be asleep,\" Kaitlyn said cautiously. \"And she might not be-and Mr. Zetes might be there____\" \"And pigs might fly. We\u0027ll never find out unless we go see.\" Gabriel stood, as if everything were decided. Jeez, he\u0027s sure active all of a sudden. Now that he\u0027s got a stake in things. \"Lewis,\" Kaitlyn said mildly. But Lewis was right. Joyce was asleep, with the French doors to her room wide open. Kaitlyn glanced at Rob, and what otherwise would have been just a meaningful look took on words. Too bad, she told him. I was hoping we might get a chance to go back into that hidden room-but it\u0027s too risky. She\u0027d hear us. He nodded. It would have been too risky anyway. Those doors are mostly glass-and if she woke up, she\u0027d be looking straight out at that panel. Lewis was screwing his face into an unaccustomed frown. I thought we were supposed to be talking out loud. Not when we\u0027re standing outside Joyce\u0027s door, Kaitlyn said. This thing is useful when we need to be quiet. She moved stealthily away. They found Gabriel already in the front lab, kneeling by a bookcase, scanning the journals inside. Kaitlyn went to help him. \"There are more bookcases in the back,\" Anna said, and she and Lewis went through the door. Rob joined Kaitlyn. He didn\u0027t need to say anything-she could feel his watchful protectiveness. He meant to keep an eye on her when Gabriel was around. There\u0027s no need, Kaitlyn thought, and then wondered if anyone had heard her. Oh, she didn\u0027t like this-this exposure. Not being sure if your own thoughts were private. She reached crossly for a book. We\u0027ve got to get rid of this thing. On either side of her, Rob and Gabriel were radiating agreement. They looked for what seemed like hours. Kaitlyn scanned journals with names like Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research and Research in Parapsychology. Some were translations of foreign journals with tongue-twisting names like Sdelovaci Technika. There were articles about telepathy, thought projection, suggestibility. But nothing that looked remotely helpful to their situation. At last, when Kaitlyn was beginning to worry that Joyce had to wake up soon, Anna called excitedly from the other room. People, I\u0027ve found something! They all hurried to the back lab and gathered around her. \" \u0027On stability in telepathic linkage as a function of equilibrium in self-sustaining geometric constructs,\u0027\" she said, holding a journal with a red cover. \"It\u0027s about groups in telepathic links-groups like its.\" \"What on earth is a self-sustaining geometric construct?\" Kaitlyn asked, very calmly. Anna flashed a smile. \"It\u0027s a web. You said it yourself, Kaitlyn-we\u0027re like five points that are joined to form a geometrical shape. And the point is that it\u0027s stable-that\u0027s what this article is saying. Two minds connected aren\u0027t stable. Three or four minds connected aren\u0027t stable. But five minds connected are. They form a-a sort of stable shape, and the whole thing stays in balance after that. That\u0027s why we\u0027re still linked.\" Rob glanced at Gabriel. \"So it\u0027s your fault. You shouldn\u0027t have connected all five of us.\" Gabriel ignored him, reaching for the journal. \"What I want to know is how to get unconnected.\" \"I\u0027m getting there,\" Anna said, holding it away from him. \"I haven\u0027t read that part yet, but it\u0027s got a section here about how to disrupt the stability and break the connection.\" Her eyes scanned down the page as she continued to hold the journal away from Gabriel. The others waited impatiently. \"This says that it\u0027s all theoretical, that nobody\u0027s ever really gotten five minds linked together.... Wait ... then it says that some larger groups may be stable, too.... Okay, here. Got it.\" Anna began to read aloud. \u0027\"Breaking the link would be harder than initiating it, would require a far greater amount of power....\u0027 But wait, it says there is one certain way of breaking it-\" Anna stopped abruptly, eyes fixed on the page. Kaitlyn could feel her shock and dismay. \"What?\" Gabriel demanded. \"What does it say?\" Anna looked up at him. \"It says the only certain way of breaking the connection is for one of the group to die.\" Everyone stared at her, stunned. There was no sound, either mental or vocal. \"You mean,\" Lewis said shakily, at last, \"that the web won\u0027t kill us-but that the only way to get rid of it is for one of us to be killed?\" Anna shook her head-not a negative, merely a helpless gesture. \"That\u0027s what the article says. But- it\u0027s only a theory. Nobody can really know-\" Gabriel snatched the journal from her. He read rapidly, then stood for a moment very still. Then, with a furious gesture, he threw the journal at a wall. \"It\u0027s permanent,\" he said flatly, turning to stare at the wall himself. Kaitlyn shivered. His anger frightened her, and it mixed with her own feelings of shock and fear. In a lot of ways she\u0027d enjoyed the connection. It was interesting, excising. Different. But to never be able to break it... to know you\u0027d be stuck in a web until one of them died . .. My whole life has changed, she thought. Forever. Something . . . irrevocable . .. has happened, and there\u0027s no way to undo it. I will never be alone, unconnected, again. \"At least we know it\u0027s not going to kill any of us,\" Anna said in a quiet voice. Kaitlyn said slowly, \"Like you said, that article might be wrong. There might be some other way to break it-we can read other books, other journals, and see.\" \"There is a way. There has to be,\" Gabriel said, in a cracked, almost unrecognizable voice. He\u0027s the most desperate of all of us, Kait realized with something like dispassion. He can\u0027t stand being this close-having us all this close to him. Until we find it, you all stay away from me, Gabriel\u0027s mental voice said, as if in answer to Kaitlyn\u0027s thought. Had he heard her? \"Meanwhile,\" Rob said in a quiet, level voice, \"we might work on learning how to control it-\" Just stay away! Gabriel shouted, and he strode out of the room. Lewis, Anna, Rob, and Kaitlyn were left staring after him. \"Why\u0027s he so mad at us?\" Lewis asked. \"If it\u0027s anyone\u0027s fault, it\u0027s his.\" Rob smiled faintly. \"That\u0027s why he\u0027s mad,\" he said in a dry voice. \"He doesn\u0027t like being wrong.\" \"It\u0027s more than that,\" Kaitlyn said. \"He helped us-and look where it got him. So it just confirms what he thought in the first place, that you should never help.\" There was another silence, while everyone just stood. We still haven\u0027t taken it all in, Kaitlyn thought. We\u0027re in shock. Then she gave herself a mental shake. \"Those bookcases look pretty bad. We\u0027d better clean things up quick. We can look for other articles about breaking the web later, when we know Joyce won\u0027t be around.\" They straightened the books and the rows of plastic journal holders in both labs. It was as she was putting on the final touches that Kaitlyn found another article that intrigued her. Someone had marked the page with a red plastic Post-it flag. The title was simply \"Chi and Crystals.\" You guys? What\u0027s chi? she asked, scarcely aware that she wasn\u0027t asking it out loud. \"It\u0027s a Chinese word for your life energy,\" Lewis said, coming to her. \"It flows all through your body in different channels, sort of like blood-or electricity. Everybody has it, and psychics have more of it.\" \"So chi is what Rob channels?\" Kaitlyn said. \"That\u0027s one name for it,\" Rob said. \"At the other center they told me lots of others-like in India they call it prana, and the ancient Egyptians used to call it sekhem. It\u0027s all the same thing. All living things have it.\" \"Well, according to this article, crystals store it,\" Kaitlyn said. Rob frowned. \"Crystals aren\u0027t alive. . ..\" \"I know, but this says that theoretically a crystalline structure could store it up, kind of like a charged battery,\" Kaitlyn said. She was still looking at the article thoughtfully. Something was tugging at her, whispering significance, demanding that she pay attention to it. But she didn\u0027t know what. The article looked as if it had been read a lot.... \"She\u0027s up,\" Rob said. Kaitlyn could hear it, too- water running in the single downstairs bathroom. Joyce was awake and washing. Anna checked her watch. It\u0027s three-thirty. We can just tell her that we walked home from school. Kaitlyn nodded and she felt agreement from the others. She straightened her back, kept her head high, and went to face Joyce. The week that followed was hectic. There was school to go to during the days, and testing with Joyce in the afternoons. Any leisure time was filled with two things: trying to find a way to break the web, and trying to find out more about Mr. Zetes\u0027s plans. The problem was that they didn\u0027t make much progress with either. They didn\u0027t get into the hidden room again. Although Kait and Rob waited for a chance, Joyce never left the Institute again and she slept with her doors open. Kaitlyn lived in a perpetual state of astonishment and nervousness. It was hard to be constantly on her guard with Joyce, to keep from talking about the only two things that were now important in her life. But somehow she managed it-they all managed it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-strange-power-dark-visions-1/page-12.html","bookId":2124,"book":{"id":2124,"title":"The Strange Power (Dark Visions #1)","description":"Storyline: The Strange Power (Dark Visions #1) They said she had evil eyes...
