{"id":93795,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"After she closed it, she looked at herself in the bathroom mirror. She didn\u0027t usually spend much time at mirrors, but just now . . . Her hair was rather disheveled, falling in fine tangles to her waist. Wispy red curls had formed on her forehead. Her strangely ringed eyes looked back at her sarcastically. So you don\u0027t care about boys, huh? they seemed to ask. So how come you\u0027re thinking that next time you ought to brush your hair before barging in on them? Kaitlyn turned abruptly toward the shower-and that was when she remembered Marisol\u0027s visit. \"Watch out or get out. . . . This place is different than you think. ...\" God, had that really happened? It seemed more like a dream than anything else. Kaitlyn stood frozen in the middle of the bathroom, her happiness in the morning draining away. Was Marisol crazy? She must be-she must have some kind of mental trouble, creeping around in the middle of the night and standing over people in bed. I\u0027ve got to talk to someone about it, Kait realized. But she didn\u0027t know who. If she told Joyce, Marisol might get in trouble. It would be like snitching-and then again, what if it had all been a dream? In the sunlit, bustling morning, with sounds of laughing and washing all around, it was impossible to even consider the idea that Marisol\u0027s warning had been genuine. That there really was something wrong at the Institute. Marisol herself was in the kitchen when Kait went down for breakfast, but she returned Kaitlyn\u0027s questioning look with one of sullen blankness. And when Kait said politely, \"Marisol, could I talk to you?\" she just frowned without looking up from the orange juice she was pouring. \"I\u0027m busy.\" \"But it\u0027s-it\u0027s about last night.\" She was more than half expecting Marisol to say, \"What are you talking about?\"-which would mean that it had all been a dream. But instead Marisol shook back her mahogany hair and said, \"Oh, that. Didn\u0027t you get it? That was a joke.\" \"A joke?\" \"Of course, stupid,\" Marisol said roughly. \"Didn\u0027t you know that? You superpsychics are all so stuck-up-couldn\u0027t you tell?\" Kaitlyn\u0027s temper hit flashover. \"Well, at least we don\u0027t sneak around at night acting like lunatics!\" she snapped. \"The next time you do that, you\u0027d better watch out.\" Marisol smirked. \"Or what?\" \"Or. .. you\u0027ll see!\" Just then the others began arriving for breakfast, so Kaitlyn was spared having to think up a more specific threat. She muttered, \"Nut,\" and snagged a muffin. Breakfast was lively, just as dinner had been the night before-and just like the night before, Gabriel didn\u0027t show up. Kaitlyn forgot all about Marisol as Joyce told them the house rules and described some of the experiments the kids would be doing. \"We\u0027ll do one session of testing this morning, just to get some baselines,\" Joyce said. \"But first, anybody who wants to call their parents can do it now. Kaitlyn, I don\u0027t think you called your dad yesterday.\" \"No, but this would be a great time. Thanks,\" Kait said. She was actually rather glad to get away from the table-looking at Rob\u0027s hair in the morning sunlight made her feel strange. She called her father from a phone at the foot of the stairs. \"Are you having a good time, hon?\" \"Oh, yes,\" Kaitlyn said. \"It\u0027s warm here, Dad; I can go out without a sweater. And everybody\u0027s nice-almost everybody. Most people. Anyway, I think it\u0027s going to be great here.\" \"And you\u0027ve got enough money?\" \"Oh, yes.\" Kaitlyn knew her father had scraped together everything he could for her before she left. \"I\u0027m going to be fine, Dad. Honest.\" \"That\u0027s terrific, honey. I miss you.\" Kaitlyn blinked. \"I miss you, too. I\u0027d better go now-I love you.\" She could hear voices in the room just in front of her. She went around behind the staircase and saw an open door in the little hallway below the landing. Joyce and the others were in a room beyond. \"Come on in,\" Joyce said. \"This is the front lab, the one that used to be a family room. I\u0027m just giving the grand tour.\" The lab wasn\u0027t at all what Kait had expected. She\u0027d envisioned white walls, gleaming machines, tile floor, a hushed atmosphere. There were machines, but there was also an attractive folding screen, lots of comfortable chairs and couches, two bookcases, and a stereo playing New Age music. \"They proved a long time ago at Princeton that a homey atmosphere, is best,\" Joyce said. \"It\u0027s like the observer effect, you know-psi abilities tend to fade any time the subject is uncomfortable.\" The back lab, which had been a garage, was much the same, except that it also had a steel room rather like a bank vault. \"That\u0027s for complete isolation in testing,\" Joyce said. \"It\u0027s soundproof, and the only communication with the inside is by intercom. It\u0027s also like a Faraday cage-it blocks out any radio waves or other electronic transmissions. If you put someone in there, you can be sure they\u0027re not using any of their normal senses to get information.\" \"I bet,\" Kaitlyn murmured. She could feel a creeping sensation along her spine-somehow she didn\u0027t like that steel room. \"I... You\u0027re not going to put me in there, are you?\" Joyce glanced at her and laughed, her eyes sparkling like green-blue jewels in her tanned face. \"No, we won\u0027t put you in there until you\u0027re ready,\" she said. \"In fact, Marisol,\" she added to the college girl behind Kaitlyn, \"why don\u0027t you go bring Gabriel down here-I think we\u0027ll test him in the isolation room for starters.\" Marisol left. \"Right, everybody, show time,\" Joyce said. \"This is our first day of experiments, so we\u0027ll keep them a bit informal, but I do want everyone to concentrate. I won\u0027t ask you to work all the time, but when you do work, I ask that you give it your all.\" She directed them into the front lab, where she installed Anna and Lewis at what looked like study carrels on either side of the room-study carrels with mysterious-looking equipment. Kaitlyn didn\u0027t hear all the instructions she gave them, but in a few minutes both Anna and Lewis seemed to be working, oblivious to anything else in the room. \"Gabriel says he\u0027s coming,\" Marisol announced from the door. \"And the volunteers are here. I could only get two so early on Sunday morning.\" The volunteers turned out to be Fawn, an extremely pretty blond girl in a motorized wheelchair, and Sid, a guy with a blue Mohawk and a ring in his nose. Very California, Kait thought approvingly. Marisol took him into the back lab. Joyce gestured at Kait to sit down on a couch over by the window. \"You\u0027ll be working with Fawn, but you\u0027ll have to share her with Rob,\" she said. \"And I think we\u0027ll let him go first. So just relax.\" Kaitlyn didn\u0027t mind-she was both excited and nervous about her own testing. What if she couldn\u0027t perform? She\u0027d never been able to use her power on cue-except at Joyce\u0027s \"vision screening,\" and then she hadn\u0027t known she was using her power. \"Now, Rob,\" Joyce said. She had attached a blood pressure gauge to one of Fawn\u0027s fingers. \"We\u0027ll have six trials of five minutes each. What I\u0027m going to ask you to do is to pull a slip of paper out of this box. If the slip says \u0027Raise,\u0027 I want you to try to raise Fawn\u0027s blood pressure. If it says \u0027Lower,\u0027 I want you to try to lower it. If it says \u0027No change,\u0027 I want you to do nothing. Understand?\" Rob looked from Fawn to Joyce, his brow wrinkled. \"Yes, ma\u0027am, but-\" \"Call me Joyce, Rob. I\u0027ll be charting the results. In each case, don\u0027t tell anyone what the slip says, just do it.\" Joyce checked her watch, then nodded at the box. \"Go ahead, pick.\" Rob started to reach in the box, but then he dropped his hand. He knelt in front of the blond girl\u0027s wheelchair. \"Your legs give you much trouble?\" Fawn looked at Joyce quickly, then back at Rob. \"I have MS-multiple sclerosis. I got it early. Sometimes I can walk, but it\u0027s pretty bad right now.\" \"Rob ...\" Joyce said. Rob didn\u0027t seem to hear her. \"Can you lift this foot here?\" \"Not very high.\" The leg lifted slightly, fell. \"Rob,\" Joyce said. \"Nobody expects you to ... We can\u0027t measure this kind of thing.\" \"Excuse me, ma\u0027am,\" Rob said softly, without looking around. To Fawn: \"How about this one? Can you lift it some?\" \"Not as high as the other.\" The foot lifted and fell. \"That\u0027s just fine. Okay, now, you just hold still. You may feel some heat or some cold, but don\u0027t you worry about that.\" Rob reached forward to clasp the girl\u0027s bare ankle. Joyce tilted her sleek blond head to look at the ceiling, then sighed and went to sit beside Kaitlyn. \"I suppose I should have known,\" she said, letting her hands with the watch and notebook fall on either side of her. Kaitlyn was watching Rob. His head was turned toward her, but he clearly wasn\u0027t seeing her. He seemed to be listening for something as his fingers moved nimbly over Fawn\u0027s ankle. As if looking at the ankle would only distract him. Kaitlyn was fascinated by his face. Whatever she thought of boys in general, her artist\u0027s eye couldn\u0027t prevaricate. Words from a book she\u0027d once read ran through her mind: \"A beautiful, honest face with the eyes of a dreamer.\" And the stubborn jaw of a fighter, she added to herself, with an amused sideways glance at Joyce. \"How does that feel?\" Rob asked Fawn. \"I... sort of tingly,\" she said, with a breathless, nervous laugh. \"Oh!\" \"Try to lift this foot again.\" Fawn\u0027s sneaker came up-almost ten inches off the footrest. \"I did that!\" she gasped. \"No-you did that.\" She was staring at him with huge eyes full of wonder. \"You did it,\" Rob said, and smiled. He was breathing quickly. \"Now we\u0027ll work on the other one.\" Kaitlyn felt a stab of jealousy. She\u0027d never felt anything quite like it before-it was similar to the ache she\u0027d gotten back in Ohio when she\u0027d heard Marcy Huang planning parties. Just now, the way Rob was concentrating on Fawn-and the way Fawn was looking at Rob . . . Joyce chuckled. \"Same thing I saw at his school,\" she said to Kait in a low voice. \"Every girl swooning when he goes by-and him not even knowing what\u0027s going on. That boy has no idea he\u0027s so sexy.\" That\u0027s it, Kait realized. He has no clue. \"But why doesn\u0027t he?\" she blurted. \"Probably because of the same thing that gave him his talent,\" Joyce said. \"The accident.\" \"What accident?\" \"He didn\u0027t mention it? I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll tell you all about it if you ask. He was hang gliding and he crashed. Broke most of his bones and ended up in a coma.\" \"Oh, my God,\" Kaitlyn said softly. \"They didn\u0027t expect him to live, but he did. When he woke up, he had his powers-but he also had some deficits. Like not knowing what girls are for.\" Kaitlyn stared at her. \"You\u0027re kidding.\" \"Nope.\" Joyce grinned. \"He\u0027s pretty innocent about the world-in a lot of ways. He just doesn\u0027t see things quite the way other people do.\" Kaitlyn shut her eyes. Of course, that explained why Rob casually reached up girls\u0027 skirts. It explained everything-except why just looking at him made her heart pound. And why just the thought of him lying in a coma hurt her. And why she had a very uncharitable desire to run over and physically drag him away from pretty Fawn right now. There\u0027s a word for your condition, her mind told her snidely. It\u0027s called-Shut up, Kaitlyn thought. But it was no use. She knew. \"That\u0027s enough for now,\" Rob was saying to Fawn. He sat back on his heels and wiped his forehead. \"If we kept working on it every week, I think I could maybe help more. Do you want to do that?\" All Fawn said was, \"Yes.\" But it was the way she said it, and the melty, awed way she looked into Rob\u0027s eyes, Kait thought. Fortunately, at that moment Joyce stood up. \"Rob, you might talk to me about arranging that,\" she said. He turned and looked at her mildly. \"I knew you\u0027d want me to,\" he said. Joyce muttered something under her breath. Then she said, \"Right, we\u0027ll work something out. Why don\u0027t you take a break now, Rob? And, Fawn, if you\u0027re too tired for another experiment. . .\" \"No, I feel great,\" Fawn said, not sappily but buoyantly. \"I feel so strong-ready for anything.\" \"Energy transfer,\" Joyce murmured, taking off the blood pressure cuff. \"We\u0027ll have to explore that.\" Then she looked up as the door connecting the front and back labs opened. \"What is it, Marisol?\" \"He is not cooperating,\" Marisol said. Gabriel was right behind her. He looked particularly gorgeous and somehow elegant-but his expression was one of cold contempt. \"Why not?\" Joyce asked. \"You know why,\" Gabriel said. He seemed to sense Kait\u0027s eyes on him, and he gave her a long, deadly look. Joyce put a hand to her forehead. \"Right, let\u0027s go talk about it.\" Rob reached out and caught her arm. \"Ma\u0027am- Joyce-I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s such a good idea. You want to be careful-\" \"I\u0027ll handle this, Rob, please,\" Joyce said, in a voice that indicated she\u0027d had enough. She went into the back lab, taking Marisol and Gabriel with her. The door shut. Anna and Lewis were looking up from their study carrels. Even Fawn was staring. Kaitlyn braced herself to look at Rob this close. \"What\u0027d you mean by that?\" she said, her voice as casual as she could make it. His gaze seemed to be turned inward. \"I don\u0027t know-but I remember what happened at that center in Durham. They tried to make him do experiments, too.\" He shook his head. \"I\u0027ll see y\u0027all later,\" he said softly, and left. Kaitlyn was pleased that he didn\u0027t turn to look back at Fawn, and displeased that he didn\u0027t turn to look back at her. A few minutes later Joyce returned, looking slightly frazzled. \"Now, where were we? Kaitlyn, it\u0027s your turn.\" Oh, not now, Kaitlyn thought. She felt raw and throbbing from her new discoveries about Rob-as if she\u0027d had a layer of skin stripped off. She wanted to go off by herself somewhere and think. Joyce was thumbing through a folder distractedly. \"Informal; we\u0027ll keep this informal,\" she murmured. \"Kaitlyn, I want you to sit down here.\" She guided Kaitlyn behind the folding screen, where there was a plush reclining chair. \"In a minute I\u0027m going to have you put on these headphones and this blindfold.\" It was a weird-looking blindfold, like goggles made of the two halves of a tennis ball. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Poor man\u0027s version of a Ganzfeld cocoon. I\u0027m trying to get the money to set up a proper Ganzfeld room, with red lights and stereo sound and all. . ..\" \"Red lights?\" \"They help induce relaxation-but never mind. The point of Ganzfeld testing is to cut off your ordinary senses, so you can concentrate on the psychic ones. You can\u0027t see anything with the blindfold; you can\u0027t hear anything because the headphones fill your ears with white noise. It\u0027s supposed to help you be receptive to any images that come into your head.\" \"But images don\u0027t come into my head,\" Kait said. \"They come into my hand.\" \"That\u0027s fine,\" Joyce said, and smiled. \"Let them come-here\u0027s a pencil and paper on a clipboard. You don\u0027t need to see to draw; just let the pencil move as it wants to.\" It sounded crazy to Kaitlyn, but Joyce was the expert. She sat down and put on the blindfold. Everything went dark. \"We\u0027ll try just one target image,\" Joyce said. \"Fawn will be concentrating on a photograph of a certain object. You try and receive her thought.\" \"Sure,\" Kaitlyn muttered, and put on the headphones. A sound like a waterfall filled her ears. Must be white noise, she thought, leaning back in the chair. She felt Joyce put the pencil in her hand and the clipboard in her lap. Okay, relax. It was actually rather easy. She knew no one could see her behind the screen-which was a good thing, because she must look pretty silly. She could just stretch out and let her thoughts drift. The darkness and the waterfall noise were like a slippery chute- there was nothing to hold on to. She felt herself sliding down ... somewhere. And she began to be afraid. The fear swept up and engulfed her before she knew what was happening. Her fingers clenched on the pencil. Easy-calm down. Nothing to be scared of... But she was scared. There was a terrible sinking in her stomach and she felt as if she were smothering. Just let images come-but what if there were horrible images out there? Frightening things in the dark, just waiting to get into her mind . . . ? Her hand began to cramp and itch. Joyce had said to let the pencil move as it wanted to. But Kaitlyn didn\u0027t know if she wanted it to move. Didn\u0027t matter. She had to draw. The pencil was moving. Oh, God, and I have no idea what\u0027s coming out, she thought. No idea-except that whatever it was, was scary. Formless darkness writhed in Kaitlyn\u0027s mind as she tried to picture whatever it was that the pencil was drawing. I have to see it. The tension in her muscles had become unbearable. With her left hand, Kaitlyn pulled the goggles and headphones off. Her right hand was still moving, like a disembodied hand from a science fiction movie, without her mind having any idea of where it was going to go next. It didn\u0027t seem part of her. It was horrible. And the drawing-the drawing was even more horrible. It was . .. grotesque. The lines were a little wobbly, but the picture perfectly recognizable. It was her own face. Her face-with an extra eye in the forehead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-strange-power-dark-visions-1/page-4.html","bookId":2124,"book":{"id":2124,"title":"The Strange Power (Dark Visions #1)","description":"Storyline: The Strange Power (Dark Visions #1) They said she had evil eyes...
