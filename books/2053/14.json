{"id":110138,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"FOURTEEN ON TENDER HORNS \"I shagged a ghost,\" said Drool, wet, naked, and forlorn, sitting in the laundry cauldron under Castle Gloucester. \"There\u0027s always a bloody ghost,\" said the laundress, who was scrubbing the lout\u0027s clothes, which had been most befouled in the moat. It had taken four of Lear\u0027s men, along with me, to pull the great git from the stinking soup. \"No excuse for it, really,\" said I. \"You\u0027ve the lake on three sides of the castle, you could open the moat to the lake and the offal and stink would be carried away with the current. I\u0027ll wager that one day they find that stagnant water leads to disease. Breeds hostile water sprites, I\u0027ll wager.\" \"Blimey, you\u0027re long-winded for such a wee fellow,\" said the laundress. \"Gifted,\" I explained, gesturing grandly with Jones. I, too, was naked, but for my hat and puppet stick, my own apparel having taken a glazing of oozy moat mess during the rescue as well. \"Sound the alarm!\" Kent came storming down the steps into the laundry, sword unsheathed and followed closely by the two young squires he\u0027d trounced not an hour before. \"Bolt the door! To arms, fool!\" \"Hello,\" said I. \"You\u0027re naked,\" said Kent, once again feeling the need to voice the obvious. \"Aye,\" said I. \"Find the fool\u0027s kit, lads, and get him into it. Wolves are loosed on the fold and we must defend.\" \"Stop!\" said I. The squires stopped thrashing wildly around the laundry and stood at attention. \"Excellent. Now, Caius, what are you on about?\" \"I shagged a ghost,\" said Drool to the young squires. They pretended they couldn\u0027t hear him. Kent shuffled forward, held back some by the alabaster grandeur of my nakedness. \"Edmund was found with a dagger through his ear, pinned to a high-backed chair.\" \"Bloody careless eater he is, then.\" \"\u0027Twas you who put him there, Pocket. And you know it.\" \"Moi? Look at me? I am small, weak, and common, I could never - \" \"He\u0027s called for your head. He hunts the castle for you even now,\" said Kent. \"I swear I saw steam coming out his nostrils.\" \"Not going to spoil the Yule celebration, is he?\" \"Yule! Yule! Yule!\" chanted Drool. \"Pocket, can we go see Phyllis? Can we?\" \"Aye, lad, if there\u0027s a pawnbroker in Gloucester, I\u0027ll take you soon as your kit is dry.\" Kent raised a startled porcupine of an eyebrow. \"What is he on about?\" \"Every Yule I take Drool down to Phyllis Stein\u0027s Pawnshop in London and let him sing \u0027Happy Birthday\u0027 to Jesus, then blow the candles out on the menorah.\" \"But the Yule\u0027s a pagan holiday,\" said one of the squires. \"Shut up, you twat. Do you want to ruin the twit\u0027s fun? Why are you here, anyway? Aren\u0027t you Edmund\u0027s men? Shouldn\u0027t you be trying to put my head on a pike or something?\" \"They\u0027ve changed allegiance to me,\" said Kent. \"After the thrashing I gave them.\" \"Aye,\" said squire one. \"We\u0027ve more to learn from this good knight.\" \"Aye,\" said squire two. \"And we were Edgar\u0027s men, anyway. Lord Edmund is a scoundrel, if you don\u0027t mind me saying, sir.\" \"And, dear Caius,\" said I. \"Do they know that you are a penniless commoner and can\u0027t really maintain a fighting force as if you were, say - oh, I don\u0027t know - the Earl of Kent?\" \"Excellent point, Pocket,\" said Kent. \"Good sirs, I must release you from your service.\" \"So we won\u0027t be paid, then?\" \"My regrets, no.\" \"Oh, then we\u0027ll take our leave.\" \"Fare thee well, keep your guard up, lads,\" said Kent. \"Fighting\u0027s done with the whole body, not only the sword.\" The two squires left the laundry with a bow. \"Will they tell Edmund where we\u0027re hiding?\" I asked. \"I think not, but you better get your kit on just the same.\" \"Laundress, how progresses my motley?\" \"Steamin\u0027 by the fire, sir. Dry enough to wear indoors, I reckon. Did I hear it right that you put a dagger through Lord Edmund\u0027s ear?\" \"What, a mere fool? No, silly girl. I\u0027m harmless. A jab from the wit, a poke to the pride are the only injuries a fool inflicts.\" \"Shame,\" said the laundress. \"He deserves that and worse for how he treats your dim friend - \" She looked away. \" - and others.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you just kill the scoundrel outright, Pocket?\" asked Kent, kicking subtlety senseless and rolling it up in a rug. \"Well, just shout it out, will you, you great lummox.\" \"Aye, like you\u0027d never do such a thing, \u0027Top of the morning; grim weather we\u0027re having; I\u0027ve started a bloody war!\u0027\" \"Edmund has his own war.\" \"See, you did it again.\" \"I was coming to tell you when I found the girl ghost having a go at Drool. Then the lout leapt out the window and the rescue was on. The ghost implied that the bastard might be rescued by France. Maybe he\u0027s allied with bloody King Jeff to invade.\" \"Ghosts are notoriously unreliable,\" said Kent. \"Did you ever consider that you might be mad and hallucinating the whole thing? Drool, did you see this ghost?\" \"Aye, I had a half a laugh wif her before I got frightened,\" said Drool, sadly, contemplating his tackle through the steamy water. \"I fink I gots deaf on me willie.\" \"Laundress, help the lad wash the death off his willie, would you?\" \"Not bloody likely,\" said she. I held the tip of my coxcomb to stay any jingling and bowed my head to show my sincerity. \"Really, love, ask yourself, What would Jesus do?\" \"If he had smashing knockers,\" added Drool. \"Don\u0027t help.\" \"Sor-ry.\" \"War? Murder? Treachery?\" reminded Kent. \"Our plan?\" \"Aye, right,\" said I. \"If Edmund has his own war it will completely bollocks up our plans for civil war between Albany and Cornwall.\" \"All well and good, but you didn\u0027t answer my question. Why didn\u0027t you just slay the bastard?\" \"He moved.\" \"So you meant to kill him?\" \"Well, I hadn\u0027t thought it through completely, but when I sent his dagger at his eye socket I believed that there might be a fatal outcome. And I must say, although I didn\u0027t stay to revel in the moment, it was very satisfying. Lear says that killing takes the place of bonking in the ancient. You\u0027ve killed a multitude of chaps, Kent. Do you find that to be the case?\" \"No, that\u0027s a disgusting thought.\" \"And yet, with Lear lies your loyalty.\" \"I\u0027m beginning to wonder,\" said Kent, sitting down now on an overturned wooden tub. \"Who do I serve? Why am I here?\" \"You are here, because, in the expanding ethical ambiguity of our situation, you are steadfast in your righteousness. It is to you, my banished friend, that we all turn - a light amid the dark dealings of family and politics. You are the moral backbone on which the rest of us hang our bloody bits. Without you we are merely wiggly masses of desire writhing in our own devious bile.\" \"Really?\" asked the old knight. \"Aye,\" said I. \"I\u0027m not sure I want to keep company with you lot, then.\" \"Not like anyone else will have you, is it? I need to see Regan before my bastard ear piercing poisons our cause. Will you take her a message, Kent - er, Caius?\" \"Will you put on your trousers, or at least your codpiece?\" \"Oh, I suppose. That had always been part of the plan.\" \"Then I will bear your message to the duchess.\" \"Tell her - no, ask her - if she still holds the candle she promised for Pocket. Then ask her if I may meet her somewhere private.\" \"I\u0027m off, then. But try to manage not to get murdered while I\u0027m gone, fool.\" \"Kitten!\" said I. \"You poxy little vermin,\" said Regan, in glorious red. \"What do you want?\" Kent had led me to a chamber far in the bowels of the castle. I couldn\u0027t believe that Gloucester would house royal guests in an abandoned dungeon. Regan must have somehow found her own way here. She had an affinity for such places. \"You received the letter from Goneril, then?\" I asked. \"Yes. What is it to you, fool?\" \"The lady confided in me,\" said I, bouncing my eyebrows and displaying a charming grin. \"What is your thought?\" \"Why would I want to dismiss father\u0027s knights, let alone take them into my service? We have a small army at Cornwall.\" \"Well, you\u0027re not at Cornwall, are you, love?\" \"What are you saying, fool?\" \"I\u0027m saying that your sister bade you come to Gloucester to intercept Lear and his retinue, and thus stop him from going to Cornwall.\" \"And my lord and I came with great haste.\" \"And with a very small force, correct?\" \"Yes, the message said it was urgent. We needed to move quickly.\" \"So, when Goneril and Albany arrive, you will be away from your castle and nearly defenseless.\" \"She wouldn\u0027t dare.\" \"Let me ask you, lady, where do you think the Earl of Gloucester\u0027s allegiance lies?\" \"He is our ally. He has opened his castle to us.\" \"Gloucester, who was nearly usurped by his eldest son - you think he sides with you?\" \"Well, with Father, then, which is the same thing.\" \"Unless Lear is aligned with Goneril against you.\" \"But she relieved him of his knights. He ranted about it for an hour after his arrival, called Goneril every foul name under the sun, and praised me for my sweetness and loyalty, even overlooking my throwing his messenger into the stocks.\" I said nothing. I removed my coxcomb, scratched my head, and sat on some dusty instrument of torture to observe the lady by torchlight and watch her eyes as the rust ground off the twisted gears of her mind. She was simply lovely. I thought about what the anchoress had said about a wise man only expecting so much perfection in something as its nature allows. I thought that I might, indeed, be witnessing the perfect machine. Her eyes went wide when the realization hit. \"That bitch!\" \"Aye,\" said I. \"They\u0027ll have it all, she and Father?\" \"Aye,\" said I. I could tell her anger didn\u0027t arise from the betrayal, but from not having thought of it first. \"You need an ally, lady, and one with more influence than this humble fool can provide. Tell me, what do you think of Edmund the bastard?\" \"He\u0027s fit enough, I suppose.\" She chewed a fingernail and concentrated. \"I\u0027d shag him if my lord wouldn\u0027t murder him - or come to think of it, maybe because he would.\" \"Perfect!\" said I. Oh Regan, patron saint of Priapus,[38] the most slippery of the sisters: in disposition preciously oily, in discourse, deliciously dry. My venomous virago, my sensuous charmer of serpents - thou art truly perfection. Did I love her? Of course. For even though I have been accused of being an egregious horn-beast, my horns are tender, like the snail\u0027s - and never have I hoisted the horns of lust without I\u0027ve taken a prod from Cupid\u0027s barb as well. I have loved them all, with all my heart, and have learned many of their names. Regan. Perfect. Regan. Oh yes, I loved her. She was a beauty to be sure - there was none in the kingdom more fair; a face that could inspire poetry and a body that inspired lust, longing, larceny, treachery, perhaps even war. (I am not without hope.) Men had murdered each other in competition for her favors - it was a hobby with her husband, Cornwall. And to her credit, while she could smile as a bloke bled to death with her name on his lips, she was not tight-fisted with her charms. It only added to the tension around her that someone was going to be shagged silly in the near future, and how much more thrilling if his life hung by a thread as he did the deed. In fact, the promise of violent death might be to the princess Regan like the nectar of Aphrodite herself, now that I think of it. Why else would she have called for my death all those years ago, when I had so diligently served her, after Goneril had left the White Tower to wed Albany. It had begun, it seems, with a bit of jealousy. \"Pocket,\" said Regan. She was perhaps eighteen or nineteen at the time, but unlike Goneril, had been exploring her womanly powers for years on various lads about the castle. \"I find it offensive that you gave personal counsel to my sister, yet when I call you to my chambers I get nothing but tumbling and singing.\" \"Aye, but a song and a tumble seem all that\u0027s needed to lift the lady\u0027s spirits, if I may say so.\" \"You may not. Am I not fair?\" \"Extremely so, lady. Shall I compose a rhyme to your beauty? A ravishing tart from Nantucket - \" \"Am I not as fair as Goneril?\" \"Next to you, she is less than invisible, just a shimmering envious vacuum, is she.\" \"But do you, Pocket, find me attractive - in a carnal way - the way you did my sister? Do you want me?\" \"Ah, of course, lady, from the morning I wake, I have but one thought, one vision: of your deliciousness, under this humble and unworthy fool, writhing naked and making monkey noises.\" \"Really, that\u0027s all you think about?\" \"Aye, and occasionally breakfast, but it\u0027s only seconds before I\u0027m back to Regan, writhing, and monkey noises. Wouldn\u0027t you like to have a monkey? We should have one around the castle, don\u0027t you think?\" \"So all you think of is this?\" And with that, she shrugged off her gown, red as always, and there she stood, raven-haired and violet-eyed, snowy fair and finely fit, as if carved by the gods from a solid block of desire. She stepped out of the pool of bloodred velvet and said, \"Drop your puppet stick, fool, and come here.\" And I, ever the obedient fool, did. And oh it led to many months of clandestine monkey noises: howling, grunting, screeching, yipping, squishing, slapping, laughing, and no little bit of barking. (But there was no flinging of poo, as monkeys are wont to do. Only the most decent, forthright monkey sounds as are made from proper bonking.) I put my heart into it, too; but the romance was soon crushed beneath her cruel and delicate heel. I suppose I shall never learn. It seems a fool is not so often taken as a medicine for melancholy, as for ennui, incurable and recurring among the privileged. \"You\u0027ve been spending a lot of time with Cordelia of late,\" said Regan, basking glorious in the gentle glow of the afterbonk (your narrator in a sweaty puddle on the bedside floor, having been summarily ejected after rendering noble service). \"I am jealous.\" \"She\u0027s a little girl,\" said I. \"But when she has you, I cannot. She\u0027s my junior. It\u0027s not acceptable.\" \"But, lady, it\u0027s my duty to keep the little princess smiling, your father has commanded it. Besides, if I am otherwise engaged you can have that sturdy fellow you fancy from the stable, or that young yeoman with the pointy beard, or that Spanish duke or whatever he is that\u0027s been about the castle for a month. Does that bloke speak a word of English? I think he may be lost.\" \"They are not the same.\" I felt my heart warm at her words. Could it be real affection? \"Well, yes, what we share is - \" \"They rut like goats - there\u0027s no art to it, and I weary of shouting instructions to them, especially the Spaniard - I don\u0027t think he speaks a word of English.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, milady,\" said I. \"But that said, I must away.\" I stood and gathered my jerkin from under the wardrobe, my leggings from the hearth, my codpiece from the chandelier. \"I\u0027ve promised to teach Cordelia about griffins and elves over tea with her dolls.\" \"You\u0027ll not,\" said Regan. \"I must,\" said I. \"I want you to stay.\" \"Alas, parting is such sweet sorrow,\" said I. And I kissed the downy dimple at the small of her back. \"Guard!\" called Regan. \"Pardon?\" I inquired. \"Guard!\" The door to her solar opened and an alarmed yeoman looked in. \"Seize this scoundrel. He hath ravaged your princess.\" She had conjured tears, in that short span of time. A bit of a wonder, she was. \"Fuckstockings,\" said I, as two stout yeomen took me by the arms and dragged me down to the great hall in Regan\u0027s wake, her dressing gown open and flowing out behind her as she wailed. It seemed a familiar motif, yet I did not feel the confidence that comes with rehearsal. Perhaps it was that Lear was actually holding court before the people when we entered the great hall. A line of peasants, merchants, and minor noblemen waited as the king heard their cases and made judgments. Still in his Christian phase, he had been reading about the wisdom of Solomon, and had been experimenting with the rule of law, thinking it quaint. \"Father, I insist you hang this fool immediately!\" Lear was taken aback, not only by the shrillness of his daughter\u0027s demand, but by the fact that she stood frontally bare to all the petitioners and made no effort to close her red gown. (Tales would be told of that day, of how many a plaintiff, having seen the snowy-skinned princess in all her glory, did hold his grievance pitiful, indeed, his life worthless, and went home to beat his wife or drown himself in the mill pond.) \"Father, your fool hath violated me.\" \"That\u0027s a fluttering bottle of bat wank, sire,\" said I. \"Begging your pardon.\" \"You speak rashly, daughter, and you appear frothing-dog mad. Calm yourself and state your grievance. How hath my fool offended?\" \"He hath shagged me roughly, against my will, and finished too soon.\" \"By force? Pocket? He isn\u0027t eight stone on a feast day - he couldn\u0027t shag a cat by force.\" \"That\u0027s not true, sire,\" said I. \"If the cat is distracted with a trout, then - well, uh, nevermind - \" \"He violated my virtue and spoiled my virginity,\" said Regan. \"I insist you hang him - hang him twice, the second time before he\u0027s finished choking from the first - that\u0027ll be fitting justice.\" I said: \"What has put vengeance in your blood, princess? I was just going to tea with Cordelia.\" Since the little one wasn\u0027t present, I hoped invoking her name might awaken the king to my cause, but it only seemed to incense Regan. \"Forced me down and used me like a common tart,\" said Regan, adding rather more pantomime than the petitioners in the hall could bear. Several began to beat their fists to their heads, others grabbed at their groins and sank to their knees. \"No!\" said I. \"I\u0027ve had many a wench by stealth, a few by guile, a number by charm, a brace by mistake, the odd harlot for coin, and, when all else has failed, I\u0027ve made do by begging, but by God\u0027s blood, none by force!\" \"Enough!\" said Lear. \"I\u0027ll hear no more. Regan, close your robe. As I have decreed, we are a kingdom of laws. There shall be a trial, and if the rascal is found guilty, then I\u0027ll see him hanged twice myself. Make way for a trial.\" \"Now?\" asked the scribe. \"Yes, now,\" said Lear. \"What do we need? A couple of chaps to do the prosecuting and defending, grab a few of those peasants for witnesses, and with due process, habeas corpus, fair weather and whatnot, we\u0027ll have the fool dangling black-tongued before tea. Will that suit you, daughter?\" Regan closed her robe and turned away coyly. \"I suppose.\" \"And you, fool?\" Lear winked at me, none too subtly. \"Aye, majesty. A jury, perhaps, chosen from that same group as the witnesses.\" Well, one has to make an effort. From their reaction I would be acquitted, on a \"who could blame\" him basis: justifiable shaggicide, they\u0027d call it. But no. \"No,\" said the king. \"Bailiff read the charges.\" The bailiff obviously hadn\u0027t written up charges, so he unrolled a scroll on which was written something entirely unconnected to my case, and faked it: \"The Crown states that on this day, October fourteenth, year of Our Lord, one thousand, two hundred, and eighty-eight, the fool known as Pocket, did with forethought and malice, shag the virgin princess Regan.\" There was cheering from the gallery, a little scoffing from the court. \"There was no malice,\" said I. \"Without malice, then,\" said the bailiff. At this point, the magistrate, who normally functioned as a castle steward, whispered to the bailiff, who normally was the chamberlain. \"The magistrate wishes to know how was that?\" \"\u0027Twas sweet, yet nasty, your honor.\" \"Note that the accused hath stated that it was [sweet and nasty], thereby admitting his guilt.\" More cheering. \"Wait, I wasn\u0027t ready.\" \"Smell him,\" said Regan. \"He reeks of sex, like fish and mushroom and sweat, doesn\u0027t he?\" One of the peasant witnesses ran forth and sniffed my bits mercilessly, then looked to the king, nodding. \"Aye, your honor,\" said I. \"I\u0027m sure I have an odor about me. I must confess, I was sans trou today in the kitchen, while awaiting my laundry, and Bubble had left a casserole out on the floor to cool, and it did trip me and I fell prick-deep in gravy and goo - but I was on my way to chapel at the time.\" \"You put your dick in my lunch?\" said Lear. Then to the bailiff, \"The fool put his dick in my lunch?\" \"No, in your beloved daughter,\" said Regan. \"Quiet, girl!\" barked the king. \"Captain Curan, send a guard to watch the bread and cheese before the fool has his way with it.\" It went on like that, with things looking rather grim for me as the evidence mounted against me, peasants taking the opportunity to describe the most lecherous acts they could imagine a wicked fool might perpetrate on an unsuspecting princess. I thought testimony of the sturdy stable boy particularly damning at first, but eventually it led to my acquittal. \"Read that back, so the king may hear the true heinous nature of the crime,\" said my prosecutor, who I believe butchered cattle for the castle as his normal vocation. The scribe read the stable boy\u0027s words: \"Yes, yes, yes, ride me, you crashing tree-cocked stallion.\" \"That\u0027s not what she said,\" said I. \"Yes, it is. It\u0027s what she always says,\" said the scribe. \"Aye,\" said the steward. \"Aye, it is,\" said the priest. \"S��,\" said the Spaniard. \"Well, she never says that to me,\" said I. \"Oh,\" said the stable boy. \"Then it\u0027s \u0027Prance, you twig-dicked little pony,\u0027 is it?\" \"Possibly,\" said I. \"She never says that to me,\" said the yeoman with the pointy beard. Then there was a moment of silence, while all who had spoken looked around at one another, then furiously avoided eye contact and found spots on the floor of great interest. \"Well,\" said Regan, chewing a fingernail as she spoke, \"there is a chance that, uh, I was having a dream.\" \"Then the fool did not take your virtue?\" asked Lear. \"Sorry,\" said Regan sheepishly. \"It was but a dream. No more wine at lunch for me.\" \"Release the fool!\" said Lear. The crowd booed. I walked out of the hall side by side with Regan. \"He might have hung me,\" I whispered. \"I\u0027d have shed a tear,\" said she with a smile. \"Really.\" \"Woe to you, lady, should you leave that rosebud asterisk of a bum-hole unguarded on our next meeting. When a fool\u0027s surprise comes unbuttered, a Pocket\u0027s pleasure will a princess punish.\" \"Oooo, do tease, fool, shall I put a candle in it so you can find your way.\" \"Harpy!\" \"Rascal!\" \"Pocket, where have you been?\" said Cordelia, who was coming down the corridor. \"Your tea has gone cold.\" \"Defending big sister\u0027s honor, sweetness,\" said I. \"Oh bollocks,\" said Regan. \"Pocket dresses the fool, but he is ever our hero, isn\u0027t he, Regan?\" said Cordelia. \"I think I\u0027m going to be ill,\" said the elder princess. \"So, love,\" said I, rising from my perch on the torture machine and reaching into my jerkin. \"I\u0027m pleased you feel that way about Lord Edmund, for he has sent me with this letter.\" I handed her the letter. The seal was dodgy, but she wasn\u0027t looking at the stationery. \"He\u0027s smitten with you, Regan. In fact, so smitten he tried to cut off his own ear to deliver with this missive, to show you the depth of his affection.\" \"Really? His ear.\" \"Say nothing at the Yule feast, tonight, lady, but you\u0027ll see the bandage. Mark it as a tribute of his love.\" \"You saw him cut his ear?\" \"Yes, and stopped him before the deed was done.\" \"Was it painful, do you think?\" \"Oh yes, lady. He has already suffered more than have others in months of knowing you.\" \"That\u0027s so sweet. Do you know what the letter says?\" \"I was sworn not to look upon pain of death, but come close - \" She leaned close to me and I squeezed the witch\u0027s puffball under her nose. \"I believe it speaks of a midnight rendezvous with Edmund of Gloucester.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fool/page-14.html","bookId":2053,"book":{"id":2053,"title":"Fool","description":"Storyline: Here\u0027s the Cliff Notes you wished you\u0027d had for King Lear-the mad royal, his devious daughters, rhyming ghosts and a castle full of hot intrigue-in a cheeky and ribald romp that both channels and chides the Bard and all Fate\u0027s bastards.
