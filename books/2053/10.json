{"id":110134,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"TEN\n ALL YOUR DREAD PLEASURES\n The sky threatened a dismal dawn as we reached Castle Albany. The drawbridge was up.\n \"Who goes there?\" shouted the sentry.\n \"\u0027Tis Lear\u0027s fool, Pocket, and his man at arms, Caius.\" Caius is the name the witches gave Kent to use to bind his disguise. They\u0027d cast a glamour on him: his beard and hair were now jet black, as if by nature, not soot, his face lean and weathered, only his eyes, as brown and gentle as a moo cow\u0027s, showed the real Kent. I advised him to pull down the wide brim of his hat should we encounter old acquaintances.\n \"Where in bloody hell have you been?\" asked the sentry. He signaled and the bridge ground down. \"The old king\u0027s nearly torn the county apart looking for you. Accused our lady of tying a rock to you and casting you in the North Sea, he did.\"\n \"Seems a spot o\u0027 bother. I must have grown in her esteem. Just last night she was only going to hang me.\"\n \"Last night? You drunken sot, we\u0027ve been looking for you for a month.\"\n I looked at Kent and he at me, then we at the sentry. \"A month?\"\n \"Bloody witches,\" said Kent under his breath.\n \"If you turn up we\u0027re to take you to our lady immediately,\" said the sentry.\n \"Oh, please do, gentle guard, your lady does so love seeing me at first light.\"\n The sentry scratched his beard and seemed to be thinking. \"Well spoken, fool. Perhaps you lot could do with some breakfast and a wash-up before I take you to my lady.\"\n The drawbridge thumped into place. I led Kent across, and the sentry met us by the inner gate.\n \"Beggin\u0027 your pardon, sir,\" the sentry said, directing his speech to Kent. \"You wouldn\u0027t mind waiting until eight bells to reveal the fool\u0027s return, would you?\"\n \"That when you\u0027re off watch, lad?\"\n \"Aye, sir. I\u0027m not sure I want to be the bearer of the joyous news of the wayward fool\u0027s arrival. The king\u0027s knights have been raising rabble round the castle for a fortnight and I\u0027ve heard our lady cursing the Black Fool as part of the cause.\"\n \"Blamed even in my absence?\" said I. \"I told you, Caius, she adores me.\"\n Kent patted the sentry on the shoulder. \"We\u0027ll escort ourselves, lad, and tell your lady we came through the gate with the merchants in the morning. Now, back to your post.\"\n \"Thank you, good sir. But for your rough clothes, I\u0027d take you for a gentleman.\"\n \"But for my clothes, I\u0027d be one,\" said Kent, his grin a dazzle amid his newly-black beard.\n \"Oh, for fuck\u0027s sake, would you two just have a gobble on each other\u0027s knob and be done with it,\" said I.\n The two soldiers leapt back as if each was on fire.\n \"Sorry, just having you on,\" said I, as I breezed by them and into the castle. \"You poofters are such a sensitive lot.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a poofter,\" said Kent as we approached Goneril\u0027s chambers.\n Midmorning. The time in between allowed us to eat, wash, do some writing, and ascertain that we had, indeed, been gone for over a month, despite it seeming only overnight to us. Perhaps that was the hags\u0027 payment? To extract a month from our lives in exchange for the spells, potions, and prognostication - it seemed a fair price, but bloody complicated to explain.\n Oswald sat at a scribe\u0027s desk outside the duchess\u0027s chambers. I laughed and wagged Jones under his nose.\n \"Still guarding the door like a common footman, then, Oswald? Oh, the years have been good to you.\"\n Oswald wore only a dagger at his belt, no sword, but his hand fell to it as he stood.\n Kent dropped his hand to his sword and shook his head gravely. Oswald sat back down on his stool.\n \"I\u0027ll have you know that I\u0027m both steward and chamberlain, as well as trusted adviser to the duchess.\"\n \"A veritable quiver of titles she\u0027s given you to sling. Tell me, do you still answer to toady and catch-fart, or are those titles only honorary now?\"\n \"All better than common fool,\" Oswald spat.\n \"True, I am a fool, and also true, I am common, but I am no common fool, catch-fart. I am the Black Fool, I have been sent for, and I shall be given entry to your lady\u0027s chambers, while you, fool, sit by the door. Announce me.\"\n I believe Oswald growled then. A new trick he\u0027d learned since the old days. He\u0027d always tried to cast my title as an insult, and boiled that I took it as a tribute. Would he ever understand that he found favor with Goneril not because of his groveling or devotion, but because he was so easily humiliated? Good, I suppose, that he\u0027d learned to growl, beaten down dog that he was.\n He stormed through the heavy door, then returned a minute later. He would not look me in the eye. \"My lady will see you now,\" he said. \"But only you. This ruffian can wait in the kitchen.\"\n \"Wait here, ruffian,\" said I to Kent. \"And make some effort not to bugger poor Oswald here, no matter how he should beg for it.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a poofter,\" said Kent.\n \"Not with this villain, you\u0027re not,\" said I. \"His bum is property of the princess.\"\n \"I\u0027ll see you hanged, fool,\" said Oswald.\n \"Aroused by the thought, are you, Oswald? No matter, you\u0027ll not have my ruffian. Adieu.\"\n Then I was through the doors, and into Goneril\u0027s chambers. Goneril sat to the back of a great, round room. Her quarters were housed in a full tower of the castle. Three floors: this hall for meeting and business, another floor above it would have rooms for her ladies, her wardrobe, bathing and dressing, the top would be where she slept and played, if she still played.\n \"Do you still play, pumpkin?\" I asked. I danced a tight-stepped jig and bowed.\n Goneril waved her ladies away.\n \"Pocket, I\u0027ll have you - \"\n \"Oh, I know, hanged at dawn, head on a pike, guts for garters, drawn and quartered, impaled, disemboweled, beaten, and made into bangers and mash - all your dread pleasures visited on me with glorious cruelty - all stipulated, lady - duly noted and taken as truth. Now, how may a humble fool serve before his hour of doom descends?\"\n She twisted up her lip as if to snarl, then burst out laughing and quickly looked around to make sure that no one saw her. \"I will, you know - you horrible, wicked little man.\"\n \"Wicked? Moi?\" said I in perfect fucking French.\n \"Tell no one,\" she said.\n It had always been that way with Goneril. Her \"tell no one,\" however, applied only to me, not to her, I had found out.\n \"Pocket,\" she once said, brushing her red-gold hair near a window, where it caught the sun and seemed to shine as if from within. She was perhaps seventeen then, and had gotten in the habit of calling me to her chambers several times a week and questioning me mercilessly.\n \"Pocket, I am to be married soon, and I am mystified by man bits. I\u0027ve heard them described, but that\u0027s not helping.\"\n \"Ask your nurse. Isn\u0027t she supposed to teach you about such things?\"\n \"Auntie\u0027s a nun, and married to Jesus. A virgin.\"\n \"You don\u0027t say? She went to the wrong bloody convent, then.\"\n \"I need to talk to a man, but not a proper man. You are like one of those fellows that Saracens have look over their harems.\"\n \"A eunuch?\"\n \"See, you are worldly and know of things. I need to see your willie.\"\n \"Pardon? What? Why?\"\n \"Because I\u0027ve never seen one, and I don\u0027t want to seem na\u0026iuml;ve on my wedding night when the depraved brute ravages me.\"\n \"How do you know he\u0027s a depraved brute?\"\n \"Auntie told me. All men are. Now, out with your willie, fool.\"\n \"Why my willie? There\u0027s willies aplenty you can look at. What about Oswald? He may even have one, or knows where you can get hold of one, I\u0027ll wager.\" (Oswald was her footman then.)\n \"I know, but this is my first, and yours will be small and not so frightening. It\u0027s like when I was learning to ride, and first father gave me a pony, but then, as I got older...\"\n \"All right, then, shut up. Here.\"\n \"Oh, would you look at that.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"That\u0027s it, then?\"\n \"Yes. What?\"\n \"Nothing really to be afraid of then, was there? I don\u0027t know what all the fuss is about. It\u0027s rather pitiful if you ask me.\"\n \"It is not.\"\n \"Are they all this small?\"\n \"Most are smaller, in fact.\"\n \"May I touch it?\"\n \"If you feel you must.\"\n \"Well, would you look at that.\"\n \"See, now you\u0027ve angered it.\"\n \"Where in God\u0027s name have you been?\" she said. \"Father\u0027s been a madman looking for you. He and his captain have gone out on patrol every day and well into the evening, leaving the rest of his knights to wreak havoc on the castle. My lord has sent soldiers as far as Edinburgh asking after you. I should have you drowned for all the worry you\u0027ve caused.\"\n \"You did miss me, didn\u0027t you?\" I cradled the silk purse at my belt, wondering when best to spring the spell. And once she was bewitched, how exactly would I use the power?\n \"He was supposed to be in Regan\u0027s care, but by the time he moves his bloody hundred knights all the way to Cornwall it will be my turn again. I can\u0027t abide the rabble in my palace.\"\n \"What does Lord Albany say?\"\n \"He says what I tell him to say. It\u0027s all intolerable.\"\n \"Gloucester,\" said I, offering the very model of a non sequitur wrapped in an enigma.\n \"Gloucester?\" asked the duchess.\n \"The king\u0027s good friend is there. It\u0027s mid-way between here and Cornwall, and the Earl of Gloucester daren\u0027t deny the request of the dukes of both Albany and Cornwall. You wouldn\u0027t be leaving the king without care, yet you wouldn\u0027t have him underfoot, either.\" With the witches\u0027 warning about Drool in danger there, I was determined for all the drama to descend on Gloucester. I sat down on the floor near her feet, held Jones across my knees, and waited, both I and the puppet wearing jolly grins.\n \"Gloucester...\" said Goneril, letting a bit of a smile seep out. She really could be lovely when she forgot she was cruel.\n \"Gloucester,\" said Jones, \"the dog\u0027s bollocks of western bloody Blighty.\"\n \"Do you think he\u0027ll agree to it? It\u0027s not how he laid out his legacy.\"\n \"He won\u0027t agree to Gloucester, but he\u0027ll agree to go to Regan\u0027s by way of Gloucester. The rest will be up to your sister.\" Should I have felt myself a traitor? No, the old man brought this on himself.\n \"But if he doesn\u0027t agree, and he has all these men?\" She looked me in the eye now. \"It\u0027s too much power in the hands of the feeble.\"\n \"And yet, he had all the power of the kingdom not two months ago.\"\n \"You\u0027ve not seen him, Pocket. The legacy and banishment of Cordelia and Kent was just the beginning. Since you went away he\u0027s gotten worse. He searches for you, he hunts, he rails about his days as a soldier of Christ one minute, then calls to the gods of Nature the next. With a fighting force of that size - if he should feel that we\u0027ve betrayed him - \"\n \"Take them,\" said I.\n \"What? I couldn\u0027t.\"\n \"You have seen my apprentice, Drool? He eats with his hands or with a spoon, we dare not let him have a knife or fork, lest the points imperil all.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be obtuse, Pocket. What of Father\u0027s knights?\"\n \"You pay them? Take them. For his own good. Lear with his train of knights is like a child running with a sword. Are you cruel to relieve him of deadly force, when he is neither strong enough, nor wise enough to wield it? Tell Lear he must dismiss fifty of his knights and their attendants and keep them here. Tell him they will be at his beck and call when he is in residence.\"\n \"Fifty? Just fifty?\"\n \"You must leave some for your sister. Send Oswald to Cornwall with your plan. Have Regan and Cornwall make haste to Gloucester so they are there upon Lear\u0027s arrival. Perhaps they can bring Gloucester into the fold. With Lear\u0027s knights dismissed, the two whitebeards can reminisce about their glory days and crawl together to the grave in peaceful nostalgia.\"\n \"Yes!\" Goneril was becoming breathless now, excited. I\u0027d seen it before. It wasn\u0027t always a good sign.\n \"Quickly,\" said I, \"send Oswald to Regan while the sun is high.\"\n \"No!\" Goneril sat forward quickly, her bosom nearly spilling out of her gown, which captured my attention more than her fingernails digging into my arm.\n \"What?\" said I, the bells of my coxcomb but a finger\u0027s breath from jingling her d��colletage.[30]\n \"There is no peace for Lear in Gloucester. Haven\u0027t you heard? The earl\u0027s son Edgar is a traitor.\"\n Had I heard? Had I heard? Of course, the bastard\u0027s plan was afoot. \"Of course, lady, where do you think I\u0027ve been?\"\n \"You\u0027ve been all the way to Gloucester?\" She was panting now.\n \"Aye. And back. I\u0027ve brought you something.\"\n \"A present?\" She showed the delighted, wide grey-green eyes she\u0027d had when she was a girl. \"Perhaps I won\u0027t hang you, but punishment is due you, Pocket.\"\n Then the lady grabbed me and pulled me across her lap, face-down. Jones rolled to the floor beside me. \"Lady, perhaps - \"\n Smack! \"There, fool, I\u0027ve hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. So give it. Give it. Give it.\" A smack with every iamb.[31]\n \"Bloody hell, you insane tart!\" I squirmed. My ass burned with her handprint.\n Smack! \"Oh good God!\" said Goneril. \"Yes!\" She wiggled under me now.\n Smack!\n \"Ouch! It\u0027s a letter! A letter,\" said I.\n \"I\u0027ll see your little bum as red as a rose!\"\n Smack!\n I squirmed in her lap, turned, grabbed her bosoms and pulled myself upright until I was sitting in her lap. \"Here.\" I pulled the sealed parchment out of my jerkin and held it out.\n \"Not yet!\" said she, trying to roll me over and get back to smacking my bum.\n She honked my codpiece.\n \"You honked my codpiece.\"\n \"Aye, give it up, fool.\" She tried to get a hand under my codpiece.\n I reached into the silk purse and retrieved one of the puffballs as I tried to keep my manhood out of her grasp. I heard a door open.\n \"Surrender the willie!\" said the duchess.\n She had it then, there was nothing I could do. I squoze the puffball under her nose.\n \"It\u0027s from Edmund of Gloucester,\" said I.\n \"Milady?\" said Oswald, who was standing in the doorway.\n \"Let us down, pumpkin,\" said I. \"The catch-fart needs his task set.\"\n It all smacked of history.\n The game had progressed further that first day, when Oswald first interrupted us, all those years ago, but it had begun, as always, with one of Goneril\u0027s query sessions.\n \"Pocket,\" said she, \"since you were raised in an abbey, I should think you know much about punishment.\"\n \"Aye, lady. I had my share, and it didn\u0027t end there. I still endure an inquisition almost daily in these very chambers.\"\n \"Gentle Pocket, surely you jest?\"\n \"That is part of the job, mum.\"\n She stood then, and dismissed the ladies from her solar with a minor tantrum. When they were gone she said, \"I\u0027ve never been punished.\"\n \"Aye, lady, well, you\u0027re Christian, there\u0027s always time.\" I\u0027d left the Church with a curse after they walled up my anchoress and I was leaning heavily pagan at the time.\n \"No one is allowed to strike me, so there\u0027s always been a girl to take my punishment for me. My spankings.\"\n \"Aye, mum, as it should be. Spare the royal withers and all.\"\n \"And I feel funny about it. Just last week I mentioned during mass that Regan might be a bit of a cunt, and my whipping girl was soundly spanked for it.\"\n \"Might as well have whipped her for your calling the sky blue, eh? A beating for talking truth, of course you felt funny about it.\"\n \"Not that kind of funny, Pocket. Funny like when you taught me about the little man in the boat.\"\n It had been a verbal lesson only, shortly after she\u0027d insisted I teach her about manly bits. But it had kept her amused, on and off, for a fortnight. \"Oh, of course,\" said I. \"Funny.\"\n \"I need to be spanked,\" said Goneril.\n \"A constant, I\u0027d agree, lady, but again we\u0027re declaring the sky blue, aren\u0027t we?\"\n \"I want to be spanked.\"\n \"Oh,\" said I, eloquent and quick-witted rascal that I am. \"That\u0027s different.\"\n \"By you,\" said the Princess.\n \"Fuckstockings,\" I thus declared my doom.\n Well, by the time Oswald came into the room that first time, both the princess and I were as red-bottomed as Barbary monkeys, quite naked (except for my hat, which Goneril had donned) and administering rhythmically to each other\u0027s front sides. Oswald was somewhat less than discreet about it all.\n \"Alarm! Alarm! My lady is ravaged by a fool! Alarm!\" said Oswald, fleeing from the room, to raise the alarm through the castle.\n I caught up to Oswald as he entered the great hall, where Lear was sitting on his throne, Regan sitting at his feet to one side, doing needlepoint, Cordelia at the other, playing with a doll.\n \"The fool has violated the princess!\" Oswald announced.\n \"Pocket!\" said Cordelia, dropping her doll and running to my side, sporting a great, goofy grin. She was perhaps eight then.\n Oswald stepped in front of me. \"I found the fool rutting the princess Goneril like a rapacious goat, sire.\"\n \"\u0027Tis not true, nuncle,\" said I. \"I was called to the lady\u0027s solar this morning only to jest her out of a morning funk, which can be smelt upon her breath if you have doubts.\"\n At that point Goneril came running into the room, trying to arrange her skirts as she moved. She stopped beside me and curtsied before her father. She was breathless, barefoot, and one breast peeked Cyclopean out the bodice of her gown. I snatched my coxcomb off her head with a jingle and concealed it behind my back.\n \"There, fresh as a flower,\" said I.\n \"Hello, sister,\" said Cordelia.\n \"Morning, lamb,\" said Goneril, blindfolding the pink-eyed Cyclops with a quick tuck.\n Lear scratched his beard and glared at his eldest daughter.\n \"What ho, daughter,\" said he. \"Hast thou shagged a fool?\"\n \"Methinks any wench who shags a man hath shagged a fool, Father.\"\n \"That was a distinct no,\" said I.\n \"What is shagged?\" asked Cordelia.\n \"I saw it,\" said Oswald.\n \"Shag a man and shag a fool, one is the same as another,\" said Goneril. \"But this morning I have your Fool shagged, righteous and rowdy. I bonked him until he cried out for gods and horses to pull me off.\"\n What was this? Was she hoping for more punishment?\n \"That is so,\" said Oswald. \"I heard the call.\"\n \"Shagged, shagged, shagged!\" said Goneril. \"Oh, what is this I feel? Tiny bastard fools stirring in my womb. I can hear their tiny bells.\"\n \"You lying tart,\" said I. \"A fool is no more born with bells than a princess with fangs, both must be earned.\"\n Lear said, \"If that were true, Pocket, I\u0027d have a halberd run up your bum.\"\n \"You can\u0027t kill Pocket,\" said Cordelia. \"I\u0027ll need him to cheer me when I\u0027m visited by the red curse, and a horrible melancholy comes over me,\" said Cordelia.\n \"What are you on about, child?\" said I.\n \"All women get it,\" said Cordelia. \"They must be punished for Eve\u0027s treachery in the garden of evil. Nurse says it makes you ever so miserable.\"\n I patted the child\u0027s head. \"For fuck\u0027s sake, sire, you\u0027ve got to get the girls some teachers who aren\u0027t nuns.\"\n \"I should be punished!\" said Goneril.\n \"I\u0027ve had my curse for simply months,\" said Regan, not even bothering to look up from her needlepoint. \"I find that if I go to the dungeon and have some prisoners tortured I feel better.\"\n \"No, I want my Pocket,\" said Cordelia, starting to whine now.\n \"You can\u0027t have him,\" said Goneril. \"He\u0027s to be punished, too. After what he\u0027s done.\"\n Oswald bowed for no particular reason. \"May I suggest his head on a pike on the London Bridge, sire, to discourage any more debauchery?\"\n \"Silence!\" said Lear, standing. He came down the steps, walked past Oswald, who fell to his knees, and stood before me. He put his hand on Cordelia\u0027s head.\n The old king locked his hawk\u0027s gaze upon me. \"She didn\u0027t speak for three years before you came,\" he said.\n \"Aye, sire,\" said I, looking down.\n He turned to Goneril. \"Go to your quarters. Have your nurse tend to your illusions. She will see that there is no issue from it.\"\n \"But, Father, the fool and I - \"\n \"Nonsense, you\u0027re a maid,\" said Lear. \"We have agreed to deliver you thus to the Duke of Albany and so it is true.\"\n \"Sire, the lady has been violated,\" said Oswald, desperate now.\n \"Guards! Take Oswald to the bailey and flog him twenty lashes for lying.\"\n \"But, sire!\" Oswald squirmed as two guards seized his arms.\n \"Twenty lashes to show my mercy! Another word of this, ever, and your head will decorate London Bridge.\"\n We watched, stunned, as the guards dragged Oswald away, the unctuous footman weeping and red-faced from trying to hold his tongue.\n \"May I go watch?\" Goneril asked.\n \"Go,\" Lear said. \"Then to your nurse.\"\n Regan was on her feet now and had skipped to her father\u0027s side. She looked at him hopefully, up on her toes, clapping her hands lightly in anticipation.\n \"Yes, go,\" said the king. \"But you may only watch.\"\n Regan streamed out of the hall after her older sister, her raven hair flying behind her like a dark comet.\n \"You\u0027re my fool, Pocket,\" said Cordelia, taking my hand. \"Come, help me. I\u0027m teaching Dolly to speak French.\" The little princess led me away. The old king watched us go without another word, one white eyebrow raised and his hawk eye burning under it like a distant frozen star. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fool/page-10.html","bookId":2053,"book":{"id":2053,"title":"Fool","description":"Storyline: \n Here\u0027s the Cliff Notes you wished you\u0027d had for King Lear-the mad royal, his devious daughters, rhyming ghosts and a castle full of hot intrigue-in a cheeky and ribald romp that both channels and chides the Bard and all Fate\u0027s bastards.
