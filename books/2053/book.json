{"id":2053,"title":"Fool","description":"Storyline: \n Here\u0027s the Cliff Notes you wished you\u0027d had for King Lear-the mad royal, his devious daughters, rhyming ghosts and a castle full of hot intrigue-in a cheeky and ribald romp that both channels and chides the Bard and all Fate\u0027s bastards. It\u0027s 1288, and the king\u0027s fool, Pocket, and his dimwit apprentice, Drool, set out to clean up the mess Lear has made of his kingdom, his family and his fortune-only to discover the truth about their own heritage. There\u0027s more murder, mayhem, mistaken identities and scene changes than you can remember, but bestselling Moore (You Suck) turns things on their head with an edgy 21st-century perspective that makes the story line as sharp, surly and slick as a game of Grand Theft Auto.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/fool.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":24,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
