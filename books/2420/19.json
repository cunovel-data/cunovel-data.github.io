J.P. introduced Erainya, though it was clear none of them cared about her. J.P.’s arm around her waist, his complete deference toward her, seemed to irritate his acquaintances. J.P. politely cut short each conversation, declining their offers for a drink. “You must excuse me,” he told them. “When I am with Miss Manos, my time becomes very valuable.” Erainya loved him. She loved the way his friends’ mouths hung open, the way their wives stared after her as they wrung their diamond bracelets. J.P. had managed to reserve the restaurant’s best table—a corner spot with windows overlooking the golf course and, across Basse, the man-made canyon that had once been the Alamo Cement Quarry. She could just make out J.P.’s house, there on the far rim of the canyon, its windows bright with buttery light. Erainya wondered if this was a subtle invitation, eating dinner within sight of his bedroom. But no—she would think that way. J.P. wouldn’t. Last night he had comforted her so patiently, asked no questions, expected nothing in return. He had completely understood when she wanted to sleep next to Jem, so they ended up camping out in his living room, al three of them—down sleeping bags on his plush carpet, bowls of popcorn, flashlights, Yu-Gi-Oh! DVDs instead of ghost stories. Al night, Erainya lay awake, listening to the easy breathing of her child and her lover, and pondering how she would kil Wil Stirman. J.P. ordered dinner—shrimp Paesano, Parmesan salad, fettuccine Alfredo. He waved aside the wine list and ordered a magnum of ’97 Brunel o di Montalcino, not making a big deal out of it, but Erainya knew the vintage would cost more than she earned in a week. She’d made a point of learning about wine since she’d started dating J.P. The bottle arrived. He declined a taste test, sent away the waiter, and poured Erainya a generous glass as if it were Kool-Aid or Strawberry Ripple. “So did you get Jem settled?” “I suppose. He loves this lady . . . Maia Lee.” “Tres’ girlfriend.” “Yeah.” J.P. placed his hand on hers. “If I had to pick one eight-year-old to watch my back in a fight, I’d pick Jem. He’l be fine.” She managed a smile. A small knot of worry was twisting in her throat. Jem had never spent the night away from her—at least not since he was very small , before she’d taken permanent custody of him. Baby- sitters, sleepovers . . . she couldn’t deal with them. She’d never been able to shake the fear that he would disappear somehow, leave her life as suddenly as he’d entered it. J.P. seemed to understand how she felt. He knew what a serious emergency it would take for her to send Jem out of town. But stil he had asked no questions. He just made himself available, in case she needed him. She realized that was why he’d shown up on her doorstep tonight, despite her refusal. He knew she shouldn’t be alone. “Hey,” he said gently. “I thought you liked shrimp.” She looked down. Appetizers had appeared and she hadn’t even noticed. “I haven’t been fair to you,” she said. “I’ve haven’t explained anything.” “We agreed not to talk about our jobs. I’m sure you don’t want to hear about the sinuses I cleared today.” “Sinuses won’t kil you.” “I don’t know. There was this big nasty one—” “I’m serious, J.P.” “You don’t have to explain anything,” he said. “I trust you. If you don’t tel me, you have a good reason.” She wanted to cry. She knew so much about him. Once she’d realized she might actual y love this man, she’d run a complete background check. She knew al about his school days, his career, his wife, who had died in childbirth twenty years ago and whose name he had never so much as mentioned. J.P. had never remarried. He’d devoted his life to raising his daughter, who had just recently graduated from col ege. Except for the one horrendous tragedy of his wife’s death, the man had no secrets, no enemies, no skeletons in the closet. Erainya’s closet, on the other hand, was loaded. There was so much she couldn’t tel him. It was easier to concentrate on the wine and the shrimp Paesano. The sky darkened. Traffic on Basse subsided to an occasional streak of headlights, the rattlesnake sizzle of tires on wet asphalt. J.P. twirled his fork in the fettuccine. “Have you told Tres our plans?” Their plans. “I haven’t said anything,” she admitted. “Not yet.” He kept his attention careful y focused on achieving the perfect bite-sized forkful of pasta. “I’l tel him soon,” she said. “Only if it’s stil what you want.” He tried to sound casual, but she heard the fragility in his voice. He had opened himself up for emotional hurt, for the first time since his wife’s death. The fact that Erainya had so much power over him scared her. They had agreed to get married in the fal . She would quit working, close the agency. He would provide for her and Jem. He had more money than they would ever need. Did she real y want this? She only had to look at J.P. to know the answer was yes. No one had ever loved her so much. And the sex . . . wel , she’d almost consigned herself to a life of celibacy until J.P. came along. The sex was fantastic. At first, she had resisted the idea of quitting work. She told herself she needed the job. It was part of her identity. But she believed that less and less. For a few years after taking over the agency, she’d felt good about the work. She’d been exorcising Fred’s spirit, becoming a PI in her own right to prove that she could. But business soon began to go sour, deteriorating into a petty grudge match between her and Barrera. Despite her way with people, her contacts, her face-to-face talents, she wasn’t much of a businesswoman. She hated the Internet, computers, information brokers. She liked the human part of the PI business, and that part was disappearing. She was rapidly becoming a dinosaur. She’d been contemplating quitting, in fact, the day a young man named Tres Navarre had walked into her office, looking for work. Something about him had reinvigorated her—made her want to teach him the trade. He had made the work interesting again, fresh, good. But now . . . she wanted an escape. She wanted to believe she could slip out from under Fred Barrow’s legacy, with Jem safely in her arms, and start a new life at age fifty-one. Almost as soon as she made that wish, Wil Stirman had reappeared in her life. J.P. pushed his plate aside, took a long drink of wine. “Al right. I lied.” Erainya realized she’d been silent too long. “What?” “I do want to know. Let me help. Tel me what’s going on.” She wanted to. Her anger at Stirman had faded to a dul ache. Her confidence was starting to slip. The enormous Colt in her purse seemed ridiculous in this elegant restaurant, with the affluent people and the candlelight, the shrimp and fettuccine and wine. “Not here,” she said. “Wil you come back to the house?” The house. As if there were only one—with the bright yel ow lights across the canyon, shining through the rain. Ten years ago, this quarry had been the poorest neighborhood in San Antonio. Workers’ shacks lined dusty roads and dump trucks rumbled back and forth, hauling limestone to the rail depot. Now the quarry was a golf course, a clubhouse, a string of fashionable mansions around the canyon rim. Even the old factory with its smokestacks had been transformed into an upscale shopping center. The very location of J.P.’s house seemed to suggest that anything was possible. She decided she would tel him everything. She would postpone her hunt, at least until the morning. And if the worst happened, if Stirman got to her first, she would trust this man—a man she had known for such a short time—to do what was necessary to protect Jem. “Back to our house,” she said. “That would be wonderful.” His smile was the best reward, the only reward, she’d had for days. A battered white Chevrolet was blocking the al ey behind the restaurant. It idled at a crazy angle, headlights il uminating the dumpsters, fender almost kissing J.P.’s Lexus. The man sitting on the hood was a Latino in his late twenties—lean and muscular, military haircut, beige shorts and a green camp shirt. Nice legs, Erainya thought absently. Two glasses of ’97 Brunel o had taken the edge off her apprehension. It was hard to think about danger when J.P.’s arm was around her. The young man looked at them sheepishly. It didn’t take Erainya long to see why. There was a deep gash in J.P.’s car door. The sideview mirror had been sheared off. Erainya had warned J.P. not to park back here. The lane was too narrow, squeezed between the restaurant and the golf course fence, and it was completely shielded from sight, perfect for car thieves. But the front lot had been ful , the al ey was convenient, and J.P. cared as little about parking conventions as he did wine prices. “I’m sorry, sir,” the young man said. “I was trying to get around the dumpster.” He turned up his palms, revealing a crucifix tattoo on his inner arm. The guy obviously wasn’t a Paesano’s customer. Probably an off-duty waiter, worried he’d get fired for bashing the Lexus. J.P. looked pained. He knelt down to examine the damage. “Wel , it’s fixable, anyway.” “Real y sorry,” the man said again. “Hope we can solve this without insurance.” “I doubt you want to do that,” J.P. said. “Probably looking at a few thousand dol ars.” Erainya decided the young man wasn’t a waiter. Something about his tattoo was wrong, and the way he held himself—not real y sheepish, after al . He was coiled like a spring, as if he were used to watching his back. He was staring at her, almost like he was trying to warn her of something. “You’l have to talk to my boss,” the young man said. He slid off the hood of the Chevrolet and stepped aside. Erainya realized, too late, what was wrong about him. He moved like a convict. The Chevrolet’s back door opened. The man who stepped out was tal , with a triangle of black hair, dark glasses, an expensive leather jacket and pale, pale skin. He said, “Change of plans, Mrs. Barrow.” The name froze her. She should have reached for her Colt, but her hand wouldn’t obey. She watched the glint of the man’s pistol as it emerged from his leather jacket. J.P. said, “No.” Erainya tried to warn him, to stop him, but he stepped in front of her, shielding her. The gun fired. The bul et ripped through the white broadcloth above his belt. Erainya wanted to scream. She wanted to move. But the Colt in her purse might as wel have been at home. J.P. crumpled to his knees. And Wil Stirman turned, pointing his gun at the center of her chest.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/southtown-tres-navarre-5/page-19.html","bookId":2420,"book":{"id":2420,"title":"Southtown (Tres Navarre #5)","description":"Storyline: Southtown (Tres Navarre #5) For Tres Navarre, English professor turned private investigator, business has lately taken a drastic turn south. But if chasing down bail jumpers, adulterous spouses, and workmen\u0027s comp cases seemed like the dregs of the PI game, it was at least a living. Not as much could be said for tracking down a man like Will \"the Ghost\" Stirman. The stone-cold killer has just staged a bloody escape from the Floresville State Penitentiary with a gang of violent cons as spooked by Stirman as those on the outside who helped put him behind bars. And no one seems more worried than Navarre\u0027s boss and mentor, Erainya Manos. It was her husband along with rival PI Sam Barrera who built the case that sent Stirman away. But Erainya\u0027s husband is dead and she\u0027s certain Stirman won\u0027t let that stand in the way of his taking revenge against her and her adopted son. All of Navarre\u0027s instincts are screaming that there\u0027s more to this case than meets the eye. But Erainya won\u0027t tell him--and Sam Barrera seems to be escaping into a strange twilight from a truth too terrible to remember. That leaves Tres to dig into a twisted mystery of greed, vigilantism, and murder, where lives are bought and sold and the line between guilt and innocence is razor-thin. Meanwhile, Stirman and his gang are coming, leaving behind them a trail of brutal, unforgiving violence that will end in an area of San Antonio known as Southtown--but that may soon just as well be called hell on earth.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/southtown-tres-navarre-5.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/southtown-tres-navarre-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:45 PM"}}
