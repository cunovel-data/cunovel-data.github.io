{"id":14904,"no":25,"title":"AN OXFORD LANDLADY","content":"It was a crisp October afternoon, and along Iffley Road the wind was chivvying the yellow leaves. We stood at the window watching the flappers opposite play hockey. One of them had a scarlet tam-o\u0027-shanter and glorious dark hair underneath it.... A quiet tap at the door, gentle but definite, and in came Mrs. Beesley. If you have been at our digs, you know her by sight, and have not forgotten. Hewn of the real imperial marble is she, not unlike Queen Victoria in shape and stature. She tells us she used to dance featly and with abandon in days gone by, when her girlish slimness was the admiration of every greengrocer\u0027s assistant in Oxford—and even in later days when she and Dr. Warren always opened the Magdalen servants\u0027 ball together. She and the courtly President were always the star couple. I can see her doing the Sir Roger de Coverley. But the virgin zone was loosed long ago, and she has expanded with the British Empire. Not rotund, but rather imposingly cubic. Our hallway is a very narrow one, and when you come to visit us of an evening, after red-cheeked Emily has gone off to better tilting grounds, it is a prime delight to see Mrs. Beesley backing down the passage (like a stately canal boat) before the advancing guest. Very large of head and very pink of cheek, very fond of a brisk conversation, some skill at cooking, slow and full of dignity on the stairs, much reminiscent of former lodgers, bold as a lion when she thinks she is imposed upon, but otherwhiles humorous and placable—such is our Mrs. Beesley. She saw us standing by the window, and thought we were watching the leaves twisting up the roadway in golden spirals. \"Watching the wind?\" she said pleasantly. \"I loves to see the leaves \u0027avin\u0027 a frolic. They enjoys it, same as young gentlemen do.\" \"Or young ladies?\" I suggested. \"We were watching the flappers play hockey, Mrs. Beesley. One of them is a most fascinating creature. I think her name must be Kathleen....\" Mrs. Beesley chuckled merrily and threw up her head in that delightful way of hers. \"Oh, dear, Oh, dear, you\u0027re just like all the other gentlemen,\" she said. \"Always awatchin\u0027 and awaitin\u0027 for the young ladies. Mr. Bye that used to be \u0027ere was just the same, an\u0027 he was engaged to be marrit. \u0027Ad some of \u0027em in to tea once, he did. I thought it was scandalous, and \u0027im almost a marrit gentleman.\" \"Don\u0027t you remember what the poet says, Mrs. Beesley?\" I suggested: \"Beauty must be scorned in none Though but truly served in one.\" \"Not much danger of you gentlemen bein\u0027 too scornful,\" said Mrs. Beesley. Her eyes began to sparkle now that she saw herself fairly embarked upon a promising conversation. She sidled a little farther into the room. Lloyd winked at me and quietly escaped behind her. \"Seeing as we\u0027re alone,\" said Mrs. Beesley, \"I come to you to see about dinner to-night. I knows as you\u0027re the father of \u0027em all.\" (That is her quaint way of saying that she thinks me the leading spirit of the three who dig with her.) \"How about a little jugged \u0027are? Nice little \u0027ares there are in Cowley Road now. I thinks \u0027are is very tender an\u0027 tasty. That, an\u0027 a nice \u0027ot cup o\u0027 tea?\" The last \u0027are had been, in Tennyson\u0027s phrase, \"the heir of all the ages,\" so I deprecated the suggestion. \"I don\u0027t think hare agrees with Mr. Williams,\" I said. \"\u0027Ow about a pheasant?\" said Mrs. Beesley, stroking the corner of the table with her hand as she always does when in deep thought. \"A pheasant and a Welsh rabbit, not too peppery. That goes well with the cider. Dr. Warren came \u0027ere to dinner once, an\u0027 he had a Welsh rabbit and never forgot it. \u0027E allus used to say when \u0027e saw me, \u0027\u0027Ow about that Welsh rabbit, Mrs. Beesley?\u0027 Oh, dear, Oh, dear, \u0027e is a kind gentleman! \u0027E gave us a book once—\u0027\u0027Istory of Magdalen College,\u0027 I think he wrote it \u0027imself.\" \"I think a pheasant would be very nice,\" I said, and began looking for a book. \"Do you think Mr. Loomis will be back from town in time for dinner?\" asked Mrs. Beesley. \"I know \u0027e\u0027s fond o\u0027 pheasant. He\u0027d come if he knew.\" \"We might send him a telegram,\" I said. \"Oh, dear, Oh, dear!\" sighed Mrs. Beesley, overcome by such a fantastic thought. \"You know, Mr. Morley, a funny thing \u0027appened this morning,\" she said. \"Em\u0027ly and I were making Mr. Loomis\u0027s bed. But we didn\u0027t find \u0027is clothes all lyin\u0027 about the floor same as \u0027e usually does. \u0027I wonder what\u0027s \u0027appened to Mr. Loomis\u0027s clothes?\u0027 said Em\u0027ly. \"\u0027P\u0027raps \u0027e\u0027s took \u0027em up to town to pawn \u0027em.\u0027 I said. (You know we \u0027ad a gent\u0027man \u0027ere once that pawned nearly all \u0027is things—a Jesus gentleman \u0027e was.) \"Em\u0027ly says to me, \u0027I wonder what the three balls on a pawnbroker\u0027s sign mean?\u0027 \"\u0027Why don\u0027t you know, Em\u0027ly?\u0027 I says. It means it\u0027s two to one you never gets \u0027em back.\" Just then there was a ring at the bell and Mrs. Beesley rolled away chuckling. And I returned to the window to watch Kathleen play hockey.
