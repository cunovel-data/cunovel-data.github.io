{"id":40617,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. JOE SHOWS HIS MUSCLE.","content":"All unconscious that he was being followed, our hero went on his errand to a wholesale provision house that supplied the Grandon Hotel with meats and poultry. He felt in good spirits and so whistled lightly as he walked. Arriving at the place of business he transacted his errand as speedily as possible and then started to return to the hotel. He was just passing the entrance to a factory yard when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and wheeling around found himself confronted by Jack Sagger, Nick Sammel, and half a dozen others, who had gathered to see their leader “polish off” the country boy. “What do you want?” demanded Joe, sharply. “You know well enough wot I want, country!” exclaimed Jack Sagger. “I do not.” “You took my job away from me, an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to pay you fer doing it.” “Mr. Drew had a perfect right to discharge you, Jack Sagger. He said you were impudent and he didn\u0027t want you around any more.” “You can\u0027t preach to me, country! Do you know wot I\u0027m goin\u0027 ter do?” “No.” “I\u0027m going to make you promise to leave dat job. Will yer promise?” “No.” “Den you have got to fight,” and Jack Sagger began to pull up his rather dirty coat sleeves. “Supposing I don\u0027t want to fight?” went on our hero, as calmly as he could. “Yer got ter do it, country—or else make dat promise.” “I\u0027ll make no promise to you.” “Den take dat!” As Jack Sagger uttered the last words he launched a blow at Joe\u0027s nose. But our hero ducked and the blow went wide of its mark. “Give it to him, Jack!” “Show him what you can do!” “Keep off,” came from Joe. “If you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll get hurt!” “Hear dat now! Jack, pitch in, quick, before anybody comes!” Thus urged Jack Sagger struck out once more, landing on Joe\u0027s chest. Then our hero drew back and sent in a blow with all his force. It took the other boy squarely on the chin and sent him staggering against a friend. If ever there was a surprised boy that boy was Jack Sagger. He had expected that to “polish off” Joe would be easy and he had not anticipated such a defense as had been made. He righted himself and gazed stupidly at our hero. “Wot did yer hit me fer?” he gasped. “You keep off or I\u0027ll hit you again,” answered Joe. There was a pause and Sagger sprang forward, trying to catch Joe around the arms. But our hero was too quick for him and ducked once more. Then he hit the bully in the ear and gave him another blow in the left eye. “Ouch!” roared Jack Sagger. “Don\u0027t! Oh, my eye!” “Have you had enough?” demanded Joe, who was commencing to warm up. “Pitch in, fellers!” came from Jack Sagger. “Throw him down!” “Ain\u0027t you going to do it alone?” queried Nick Sammel, in wonder, not unmingled with a suspicion that Joe would not be as easy to handle as anticipated. “I—I\u0027ve got a—a heartburn,” came lamely from Sagger. “It come on me all at onct. If it wasn\u0027t fer that I\u0027d do him up all alone.” “You\u0027re a fraud, and you haven\u0027t any heart-burn!” cried Joe. “You\u0027re afraid, that\u0027s all. If you want to fight, stand up, and we\u0027ll have it out.” “Don\u0027t you call me afraid,” said Sagger, but his voice had lost much of its bullying tone. “You\u0027re a big coward, Jack Sagger. After this I want you to leave me alone.” “Ain\u0027t you fellers going to pitch in?” demanded Sagger, turning to his cohorts. “The first boy to hit me will get paid back with interest,” said Joe, sharply. “I don\u0027t like to fight but I can do it if I have to.” One or two had edged forward but when they saw his determined air they slunk back. “Go on and fight him, Jack,” said one. “This is your mix-up, not ours.” “You said you was going to do him up brown,” put in another. “Ain\u0027t I got the heartburn?” blustered the bully. “I can\u0027t do nuthin\u0027 when I git that. Wait till I\u0027m well; then I\u0027ll show him.” “If you ever touch me again, Jack Sagger, I\u0027ll give you the worst thrashing you ever had,” said Joe, loudly. “Remember, I am not the least bit afraid of you. The best thing you can do is to keep your distance.” “Humph!” “I don\u0027t want to quarrel with anybody, but I am always ready to stick up for my rights, just you remember that.” So speaking Joe backed out of the crowd, that opened to let him pass. Several of the boys wanted to detain him, but not one had the courage to do so. As soon as he was clear of his tormentors, he hurried back to the hotel. “How did you make out?” asked Mr. Drew. “It\u0027s all right, sir, and they\u0027ll send the things to-night, sure,” answered Joe. He hesitated for a moment. “I had a little excitement on the way.” “How was that?” “Jack Sagger and some other boys followed me up and wanted to polish me off.” “You don\u0027t look as if they had done much polishing.” And the hotel man smiled. “No, Jack Sagger got the worst of it. I guess he\u0027ll leave me alone in the future.” “You mustn\u0027t fight around the hotel, Joe.” “This was on the way to Jackson \u0026 Bell\u0027s, sir. I was bound to defend myself.” “To be sure. Sagger came to me yesterday and wanted to be taken back, but I told him no—that I wouldn\u0027t have such an impudent fellow around.” As the winter season came on the hotel began to fill up and Joe was kept busy from early in the morning until late at night, and so was Frank Randolph. The two boys were firm friends, and on Sunday went to Sunday School together and also to church, when their hotel duties permitted of it. In the corridor of the hotel Joe, one day, met the timid Felix Gussing, the young man who had once had so much trouble in driving a horse. “How do you do, Mr. Gussing,” said our hero politely. “Why if it isn\u0027t Joe!” cried the young man, and smiled. “What are you doing here?” “I work at this hotel now.” “Is it possible! Didn\u0027t you like it at Riverside?” “Yes, but the place is shut up for the winter.” “Ah, I see.” “Are you stopping here, sir?” “Yes, I came in an hour ago. I have business in Philadelphia.” “Maybe you\u0027re buying horses,” said Joe, slyly. “No! no! No more horses for me,” ejaculated the dude. “I—er—this is of more importance.” No more was said just then, but later our hero met Felix Gussing again, and on the day following had an errand that took him to the young man\u0027s room. “Joe, you are quite a wise boy, perhaps I can confide in you,” said Felix Gussing, after some talk on other subjects. “I\u0027ll be glad to be of service to you, Mr. Gussing.” “I have a delicate problem to solve. Sometimes a young man can give better advice than an older person,” went on the dude. “Don\u0027t flatter me, Mr. Gussing.” “I am in love,” went on the young man, flatly. “Yes, sir.” “I am quite sure the young lady loves me.” “Then I suppose you are going to get married.” “There is an obstacle in the way.” “Oh!” “Perhaps I had better tell you the whole story—if you\u0027ll listen to me,” went on the dude. “Certainly I\u0027ll listen,” said Joe. “I\u0027ve got a little time off.” And then Felix Gussing told his tale of woe, as will be found in the next chapter.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2981/82213.html","bookId":342,"book":{"id":342,"title":"Joe The Hotel Boy","description":"简介： A number of years ago the author of this story set out to depict life among the boys of a great city, and especially among those who had to make their own way in the world.
