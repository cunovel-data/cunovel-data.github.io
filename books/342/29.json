{"id":40627,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. FROM OUT OF A TREE.","content":"Caven was right, Joe and his newly-made friend were still in the woods, doing their best to locate the two rascals. They had found the trail but lost it in the patch of tall timber, and were gazing around when they heard the trains leaving the cut. “There goes our outfit, friend,” said the westerner. “And there won\u0027t be another train along for several hours.” “It\u0027s too bad, but it can\u0027t be helped,” answered our hero. “But I\u0027ll pay you for all time lost, Mr.—” “Plain Bill Badger is my handle, stranger.” “My name is Joe Bodley.” “What about these two varmin you are after?” “They were trying to rob a friend of mine of some mining shares,” answered Joe, and gave a few details. “Well, I vow!” cried Bill Badger “That mine is close to one my dad owns. They say it ain\u0027t of much account though.” “Mr. Vane thinks it is valuable. He has had a mining expert go into the matter with great care.” “Then that\u0027s a different thing. Were you bound for the mine?” “Yes, and so was Mr. Vane. We were on the train together when he was robbed.” “I see. I was going out to my dad\u0027s mine.” “Then perhaps we can journey together—after we get through here,” said Joe. “I\u0027m willing. I like your looks. Shake.” And the pair shook hands. Although a westerner, Bill Badger knew no more about following a trail than did our hero, consequently they proceeded on their hunt with difficulty. “Reckon we\u0027ve missed \u0027em,” said Bill Badger, a while later. “Don\u0027t see hide nor hair of \u0027em anywhere.” “It\u0027s too bad if they got away,” answered Joe. “Perhaps—What was that?” The cracking of a tree limb had reached their ears, followed by a cry of alarm. A limb upon which Pat Malone was standing had broken, causing the fellow to slip to another branch below. “Hush! don\u0027t make so much noise!” said Caven, in alarm. “Gosh! I thought I was going to tumble, out of the tree to the ground,” gasped Malone, when he could catch his breath. “They are coming—I can see them,” whispered Gaff Caven. “Be as quiet as a mouse.” In a moment more Joe and Bill Badger stood directly under the tree. “I think the noise came from near here,” said Joe. “I agree,” answered the westerner. At that moment our hero looked up and saw a man\u0027s arm circling a tree limb far over his head. “They are up there!” he shouted. “Sure?” “Yes, I just saw one of them.” “Then we\u0027ve got \u0027em treed,” came with a broad grin from Bill Badger. “What\u0027s the next turn of the game?” “We have got to make them both prisoners.” “All right. Have you got a shooting iron?” “No, but I can get a club.” “Then do it, and I\u0027ll use this, if it\u0027s necessary,” and the young westerner pulled a pistol from his hip pocket. “I wish we had some ropes, with which to tie them,” continued Joe. “Here\u0027s a good big handkerchief.” “That\u0027s an idea. My handkerchief is also good and strong.” “You do the pow-wowing and I\u0027ll do the shooting, if it\u0027s necessary,” said Bill Badger. Joe looked up into the tree again but could see nobody. “Caven!” he called out. “I know you are up there and I want you to come down.” To this remark and request there was no reply. “If you don\u0027t come down we may begin to fire at you,” went on our hero. “Oh, say, do you think he\u0027ll shoot?” whispered Malone, in sudden alarm. “No; shut up!” returned Caven. “Are you coming down or not?” went on Joe. Still there was no reply. “I\u0027ll give \u0027em a shot to warn \u0027em,” said Bill Badger, and fired into the air at random. “Don\u0027t shoot me!” roared Pat Malone. “Please don\u0027t! I\u0027ll come down!” “Well, you come down first. Caven, you stay up there for the present.” After this there was a pause, and presently Pat Malone came down out of the tree looking sheepish enough. “Up with your hands!” cried Bill Badger, and confronted by the firearms the hands of the rascal went up in a hurry. Then Joe took his handkerchief and stepped up behind Malone. The hands were lowered and crossed and our hero tied them firmly together at the wrists. “Now back up to that tree yonder,” said our hero. “And don\u0027t you dare to move.” “I\u0027ll do just as you say,” whined Malone. “Only don\u0027t shoot me.” He was a coward at heart. “Now, Caven, you come down!” shouted Joe. “I don\u0027t think I care to,” answered that rascal, coolly. “If you don\u0027t come down I\u0027ll come up after you with my pistol,” broke in Bill Badger. “Maybe I can do a little shooting myself,” went on Gaff Caven. “I\u0027ll risk that.” More words followed, but in the end Caven thought it best to descend and did so. Yet his face still wore a look of defiance. He was compelled to turn around, and his hands were also tied behind him. “Now I want those mining shares, Caven,” said Joe. “I haven\u0027t got them.” “Where is the satchel?” “I threw it away when you started after me.” “Down at the railroad tracks?” “Yes.” “Don\u0027t you believe that,” broke in Bill Badger. “At least, not unless he emptied the satchel first.” “Show me the way you came,” said Joe. “Make him point out the satchel, or make him suffer,” went on Bill Badger. “I\u0027ve got an idea!” cried our hero, suddenly. “Perhaps he left the satchel in the tree.” “That\u0027s so. Well, if you want to climb up and look around, I\u0027ll watch the pair of \u0027em.” “Don\u0027t let them get away.” “If they try it, they\u0027ll go to the hospital or the graveyard,” replied the western young man, significantly. “The satchel ain\u0027t in the tree,” growled Caven, but his tone lacked positiveness. “I\u0027ll soon know for certain,” said our hero. He climbed the tree with ease, having been used to such doings when living with the old hermit. As he went from branch to branch he kept his eyes open, and presently saw a bit of leather sticking out of a crotch. He worked his way over and soon had the satchel in his possession. “How are you making out?” called up Bill Badger. “I\u0027ve got it!” shouted our hero, joyfully. “Got the papers?” “Yes,—everything,” said Joe, after a hasty examination. “Hang the luck!” muttered Gaff Caven, much chagrined. Our hero was soon on the ground once more. Here he examined the contents of the satchel with care. Everything was there, and, locking the bag, he slung the strap over his shoulder. “Now, what\u0027s the next move?” queried Bill Badger. “We ought to have these men locked up. How far is it to the nearest town?” “Ten or twelve miles, I reckon. I don\u0027t know much about the roads.” “Why can\u0027t you let us go?” asked Malone. “You\u0027ve got what you want.” “If I let you go you\u0027ll be trying to make more trouble for Mr. Vane and myself.” “Don\u0027t talk to them,” growled Caven. “If you want to lock us up, do so!” He was in an ugly humor and ready for a fight. “We\u0027ll march \u0027em along,” said Bill Badger, and so it was agreed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2981/82223.html","bookId":342,"book":{"id":342,"title":"Joe The Hotel Boy","description":"简介： A number of years ago the author of this story set out to depict life among the boys of a great city, and especially among those who had to make their own way in the world.
