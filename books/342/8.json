{"id":40606,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. BLOWS AND KIND DEEDS.","content":"Several days passed and Joe went out half a dozen times on the lake with parties from the hotel. All whom he served were pleased with him and treated him so nicely that, for the time being, his past troubles were forgotten. At the beginning of the week Ned Talmadge came to see him. “I am going away to join the folks out West,” said Ned. “I hope you will have a good time,” answered our hero. “Oh, I\u0027m sure to have that, Joe. By the way, you are nicely settled here, it would seem.” “Yes, and I am thankful for it.” “Mr. Mallison is a fine man to work for, so I have been told. You had better stick to him.” “I shall—as long as the work holds out.” “Maybe he will give you something else to do, after the boating season is over.” A few more words passed, and then Ned took his departure. It was to be a long time before the two friends would meet again. So far Joe had had no trouble with anybody around the hotel, but that evening, when he was cleaning out his boat, a man approached him and caught him rudely by the shoulder. “So you\u0027re the feller that\u0027s took my job from me, eh?” snarled the newcomer. Our hero looked up and recognized Sam Cullum, the boatman who had been discharged for drinking. Even now the boatman was more than half under the influence of intoxicants. “I haven\u0027t taken anybody\u0027s job from him,” answered Joe. “I say yer did!” growled Cullum. “It ain\u0027t fair, nuther!” To this our hero did not reply, but went on cleaning out his boat. “Fer two pins I\u0027d lick yer!” went on the tipsy boatman, lurching forward. “See here, Sam Cullum, I want you to keep your distance,” said Joe, sharply. “Mr. Mallison discharged you for drinking. I had nothing to do with it.” “I don\u0027t drink; leastwise, I don\u0027t drink no more\u0027n I need.” “Yes, you do. It would be the best thing in the world for you if you\u0027d leave liquor alone entirely.” “Humph! don\u0027t you preach to me, you little imp!” “Then leave me alone.” “You stole the job from me an\u0027 I\u0027m going to lick you for it.” “If you touch me you\u0027ll get hurt,” said Joe, his eyes flashing. “Leave me alone and I\u0027ll leave you alone.” “Bah!” snarled the other, and struck out awkwardly. He wanted to hit Joe on the nose, but the boy dodged with ease, and Sam Cullum fell sprawling over the rowboat. “Hi! what did ye trip me up for?” spluttered the half-intoxicated man, as he rose slowly. “Don\u0027t you do that ag\u0027in, do yer hear?” “Then don\u0027t try to strike me again.” There was a moment of silence and then Sam Cullum gathered himself for another blow. By this time a small crowd of boys and hotel helpers began to collect. “Sam Cullum\u0027s going to fight Joe Bodley!” “Sam\u0027ll most kill Joe!” With all his strength the man rushed at Joe. But the boy dodged again and put out his foot and the man went headlong. “Now will you let me alone?” asked our hero, coolly. “No, I won\u0027t!” roared Sam Cullum. “Somebody give me a club! I\u0027ll show him!” Arising once more, he caught up an oar and launched a heavy blow at Joe\u0027s head. For a third time our hero dodged, but the oar struck him on the arm, and the blow hurt not a little. Joe was now angry and believed it was time to defend himself. He edged towards the end of the dock and Sam Cullum followed. Then, of a sudden the boy ducked under the man\u0027s arm, turned, and gave him a quick shove that sent him with a splash into the lake. “Hurrah! score one for Joe!” “That will cool Sam Cullum\u0027s temper.” “Yes, and perhaps it will sober him a little,” came from a man standing by, who had witnessed the quarrel from the beginning. “He brought this on himself; the boy had nothing to do with it.” Sam Cullum floundered around in the water like a whale cast up in the shallows. The lake at that point was not over four feet deep, but he did not know enough to stand upright. “Save me!” he bellowed. “Save me! I don\u0027t want to drown!” “Swallow a little water, it will do you good!” said a bystander, with a laugh. “Walk out and you\u0027ll be all right,” added another. At last Sam Cullum found his feet and walked around the side of the dock to the shore. A crowd followed him and kept him from going at Joe again. “I\u0027ll fix him another time,” growled the intoxicated one, and shuffled off, with some small boys jeering him. “You treated him as he deserved,” said one of the other boatmen to Joe. “I suppose he\u0027ll try to square up another time,” answered our hero. “Well, I wouldn\u0027t take water for him, Joe.” “I don\u0027t intend to. If he attacks me I\u0027ll do the best I can to defend myself.” “He has made a nuisance of himself for a long time. It\u0027s a wonder to me that Mr. Mallison put up with it so long.” “He was short of help, that\u0027s why. It isn\u0027t so easy to get new help in the height of the summer season.” “That is true.” Joe expected to have more trouble with Sam Cullum the next day but it did not come. Then it leaked out that Cullum had gotten into a row with his wife and some of her relatives that night and was under arrest. When the boatman was brought up for trial the Judge sentenced him to six months\u0027 imprisonment. “And it serves him right,” said the man who brought the news to Joe. “It must be hard on his wife.” “Well, it is, Joe.” “Have they any children?” “Four—a boy of seven and three little girls.” “Are they well off?” “What, with such a father? No, they are very poor. She used to go out washing, but now she has to stay at home to take care of the baby. Sam was a brute to strike her. I don\u0027t wonder the relatives took a hand.” “Perhaps the relatives can help her.” “They can\u0027t do much, for they are all as poor as she is, and one of them is just getting over an operation at the hospital.” “Where do the Cullums live?” “Down on Railroad Alley, not far from the water tower. It\u0027s a mite of a cottage.” Joe said no more, but what he had been told him set him to thinking, and that evening, after his work was over, he took a walk through the town and in the direction of Railroad Alley. Not far from the water station he found the Cullum homestead, a mite of a cottage, as the man had said, with a tumbled-down chimney and several broken-out windows. He looked in at one of the windows and by the light of a smoking kerosene lamp beheld a woman in a rocking-chair, rocking a baby to sleep. Three other youngsters were standing around, knowing not what to do. On a table were some dishes, all bare of food. “Mamma, I want more bread,” one of the little ones was saying. “You can have more in the morning, Johnny,” answered the mother. “No, I want it now,” whimpered the youngster. “I\u0027m hungry.” “I\u0027m hungry, too,” put in another little one. “I can\u0027t give you any more to-night, for I haven\u0027t it,” said the mother, with a deep sigh. “Now, be still, or you\u0027ll wake the baby.” “Why don\u0027t dad come home?” asked the boy of seven. “He can\u0027t come home, Bobby—he—had to go away,” faltered the mother. “Now all be still, and you shall have more bread in the morning.” The children began to cry, and unable to stand the sight any longer Joe withdrew. Up the Alley was a grocery store and he almost ran to this. “Give me some bread,” he said, “and some cake, and a pound of cheese, and some smoked beef, and a pound of good tea, and some sugar. Be quick, please.” The goods were weighed out and wrapped up, and with his arms full he ran back to the cottage and kicked on the door. “Who is there?” asked Mrs. Cullum, in alarm. “Here are some groceries for you!” cried Joe. “All paid for!” “Oh, look!” screamed the boy of seven. “Bread, and cheese!” “And sugar!” came from one of the little girls. “And tea! Mamma, just what you like!” said another. “Where did this come from?” asked Mrs. Cullum. “A friend,” answered Joe. “It\u0027s all paid for.” “I am very thankful.” “Now we can have some bread, can\u0027t we?” queried the boy. “Yes, and a bit of smoked beef and cheese, too,” said the mother, and placing the sleeping baby on a bed, she proceeded to deal out the good things to her children.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2981/82202.html","bookId":342,"book":{"id":342,"title":"Joe The Hotel Boy","description":"简介： A number of years ago the author of this story set out to depict life among the boys of a great city, and especially among those who had to make their own way in the world.
