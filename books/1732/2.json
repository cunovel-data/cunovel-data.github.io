{"id":69046,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"It began the same night it ended. It wasn\u0027t much. It just bothered me; it still bothers me. You see, Joe Bloch, Ray Manning, and I were squatting around our favorite table in the corner bar with an evening on our hands and a mess of chatter to throw it away with. That\u0027s the beginning. Joe Bloch started it by talking about the atomic bomb, and what he thought ought to be done with it, and how who would have thought it five years ago. And I said lots of guys thought it five years ago and wrote stories about it and it was going to be tough on them trying to keep ahead of the newspapers now. Which led to a general palaver on how lots of screwy things might come true and a lot of for-instances were thrown about. Ray said he heard from somebody that some big-shot scientist had sent a block of lead back in time for about two seconds or two minutes or two thousandths of a second - he didn\u0027t know which. He said the scientist wasn\u0027t saying anything to anybody because he didn\u0027t think anyone would believe him. So I asked, pretty sarcastic, how he came to know about it. - Ray may have lots of friends but I have the same lot and none of them know any big-shot scientists. But he said never mind how he heard, take it or leave it. And then there wasn\u0027t anything to do but talk about time machines, and how supposing you went back and killed your own grandfather or why didn\u0027t somebody from the future come back and tell us who was going to win the next war, or if there was going to be a next war, or if there\u0027d be anywhere on Earth you could live after it, regardless of who wins. Ray thought just knowing the winner in the seventh race while the sixth was being run would he something. But Joe decided different. He said, \"The trouble with you guys is you got wars and races on the mind. Me, I got curiosity. Know what I\u0027d do if I had a time machine?\" So right away we wanted to know, all ready to give him the old snicker whatever it was. He said, \"If I had one, I\u0027d go back in time about a couple or five or fifty million years and find out what happened to the dinosaurs.\" Which was too bad for Joe, because Ray and I both thought there was just about no sense to that at all. Ray said who cared about a lot of dinosaurs and I said the only thing they were good for was to make a mess of skeletons for guys who were dopy enough to wear out the floors in museums; and it was a good thing they did get out of the way to make room for human beings. Of course Joe said that with some human beings he knew, and he gives us a hard look, we should\u0027ve stuck to dinosaurs, but we pay no attention to that. \"You dumb squirts can laugh and make like you know something, but that\u0027s because you don\u0027t ever have any imagination,\" he says. \"Those dinosaurs were big stuff. Millions of all kinds - big as houses, and dumb as houses, too - all over the place. And then, all of a sudden, like that,\" and he snaps his fingers, \"there aren\u0027t any anymore.\" How come, we wanted to know. But he was just finishing a beer and waving at Charlie for another with a coin to prove he wanted to pay for it and he just shrugged his shoulders. \"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s what I\u0027d find out, though.\" That\u0027s all. That would have finished it. I would\u0027ve said something and Ray would\u0027ve made a crack, and we all would\u0027ve had another beer and maybe swapped some talk about the weather and the Brooklyn Dodgers and then said so long, and never think of dinosaurs again. Only we didn\u0027t, and now I never have anything on my mind but dinosaurs, and I feel sick. Because the rummy at the next table looks up and hollers, \"Hey!\" We hadn\u0027t seen him. As a general rule, we don\u0027t go around looking at rummies we don\u0027t know in bars. I got plenty to do keeping track of the rummies I do know. This fellow had a bottle before him that was half empty, and a glass in his hand that was half full. He said, \"Hey,\" and we all looked at him, and Ray said, \"Ask him what he wants, Joe.\" Joe was nearest. He tipped his chair backward and said, \"What do you want?\" The rummy said, \"Did I hear you gentlemen mention dinosaurs?\" He was just a little weavy, and his eyes looked like they were bleeding, and you could only tell his shirt was once white by guessing, but it must\u0027ve been the way he talked. It didn\u0027t sound rummy, if you know what I mean. Anyway, Joe sort of eased up and said, \"Sure. Something you want to know?\" He sort of smiled at us. It was a funny smile; it started at the mouth and ended just before it touched the eyes. He said, \"Did you want to build a time machine and go back to find out what happened to the dinosaurs?\" I could see Joe was figuring that some kind of confidence game was coming up. I was figuring the same thing. Joe said, \"Why? You aiming to offer to build one for me?\" The rummy showed a mess of teeth and said. \"No, sir. I could but I won\u0027t. You know why? Because I built a time machine for myself a couple of years ago and went back to the Mesozoic Era and found out what happened to the dinosaurs.\" Later on, I looked up how to spell \"Mesozoic,\" which is why I got it right. in case you\u0027re wondering, and I found nut that the Mesozoic Era is when a11 the dinosaurs were doing whatever dinosaurs do. Rut of course at the time this is just so much double-talk to me, and mostly I was thinking we had a lunatic talking to us. Joe claimed afterward that he knew about this Mesozoic thing, but he\u0027ll have to talk lots longer and louder before Ray and I believe him. But that did it just the same. We said to the rummy to come over to our table. I guess I figured we could listen to him for a while and maybe get some of the bottle, and the others must have figured the same. But he held his bottle tight in his right hand when he sat down and that\u0027s where he kept it. it. [sic] Ray said, \"Where\u0027d you build a time machine?\" \"At Midwestern University. My daughter and I worked on it together.\" He sounded like a college guy at that. I said, \"Where is it now? In your pocket?\" He didn\u0027t blink; he never jumped at us no matter how wise we cracked. Just kept talking to himself out loud, as if the whiskey had limbered up his tongue and he didn\u0027t care if we stayed or not. He said, \"I broke it up. Didn\u0027t want it. Had enough of it.\" We didn\u0027t believe him. We didn\u0027t believe him worth a darn. You better get that straight. It stands to reason, because if a guy invented a time machine, he could clean up millions - he could clean up all the money in the world, just knowing what would happen to the stock market and the races and elections. He wouldn\u0027t throw a11 that away, I don\u0027t care what reasons he had. - Besides, none of us were going to believe in time travel anyway, because what if you did kill your own grandfather. Well, never mind. Joe said, \"Yeah, you broke it up. Sure you did. What\u0027s your name?\" But he didn\u0027t answer that one, ever. We asked him a few more times, and then we ended up calling him \"Professor.\" He finished off his glass and filled it again very slow. He didn\u0027t offer us any, and we all sucked at our beers. So I said, \"Well, go ahead. What happened to the dinosaurs?\" But he didn\u0027t tell us right away. He stared right at the middle of the table and talked to it. \"I don\u0027t know how many times Carol sent me back - just a few minutes or hours - before I made the big jump. I didn\u0027t care about the dinosaurs; I just wanted to see how far the machine would take me on the supply of power I had available. I suppose it was dangerous, but is life so wonderful? The war was on them - One more life?\" He sort of coddled his glass as if he was thinking about things in general, then he seemed to skip a part in his mind and keep right on going. \"It was sunny,\" he said, \"sunny and bright; dry and hard. There were no swamps, no ferns. None of the accoutrements of the Cretaceous we associate with dinosaurs,\" - anyway, I think that\u0027s what he said. I didn\u0027t always catch the big words, so later on I\u0027ll just stick in what I can remember. I checked all the spellings, and I must say that for all the liquor he put away, he pronounced them without stutters. That\u0027s maybe what bothered us. He sounded so familiar with everything, and it all just rolled off his tongue like nothing. He went on, \"It was a late age, certainly the Cretaceous. The dinosaurs were already on the way out - all except those little ones, with their metal belts and their guns.\" I guess Joe practically dropped his nose into the beer altogether. He skidded halfway around the glass, when the professor let loose that statement sort of sadlike. Joe sounded mad. \"What little ones, with whose metal belts and which guns?\" The professor looked at him for just a second and then let his eyes slide back to nowhere. \"THC were little reptiles, standing four feet high. They stood on their hind legs with a thick tail behind, and they had little forearms with fingers. Around their waists were strapped wide metal belts, and from these hung guns. - And they weren\u0027t guns that shot pellets either; they were energy projectors.\" \"They were what\u0027!\" I asked. \"Say, when was this? Millions of years ago?\" \"That\u0027s right,\" he said. \"They were reptiles. They had scales and no eyelids and they probably laid eggs. But they used energy guns. There were five of them. They were on me as soon as I got out of the machine. There must have been millions of them all over Earth - millions. Scattered all over. They must have been the Lords of Creation then.\" I guess it was then that Ray thought he had him, because he developed that wise look in his eyes that makes you feel like conking him with an empty beer mug, because a full one would waste beer. He said, \"Look, P\u0027fessor, millions of them, huh? Aren\u0027t there guys who don\u0027t do anything but find old bones and mess around with them till they figure out what some dinosaur looked like. The museums are full of these here skeletons, aren\u0027t they? Well, where\u0027s there one with a metal belt on him. If there were millions, what\u0027s become of them? Where are the hones?\" The professor sighed. It was a real, sad sigh. Maybe he realized for the first time he was just speaking to three guys in overalls in a barroom. Or maybe he didn\u0027t care. He said, \"You don\u0027t find many fossils. Think how many animals lived on Earth altogether. Think how many billions and trillions. And then think how few fossils we find. - And these lizards were intelligent. Remember that. They\u0027re not going to get caught in snow drifts or mud, or fall into lava, except by big accident. Think how few fossil men there are - even of these subintelligent apemen of a million years ago.\" He looked at his half-full glass and turned it round and round. He said, \"What would fossils show anyway? Metal belts rust away and leave nothing. Those little lizards were warm-blooded. I know that, but you couldn\u0027t prove it from petrified bones. What the devil? A million years from now could you tell what New York looks like from a human skeleton? Could you tell a human from a gorilla by the bones and figure out which one built an atomic bomb and which one ate bananas in a zoo?\" \"Hey,\" said Joe, plenty objecting, \"any simple bum can tell a gorilla skeleton from a man\u0027s. A man\u0027s got a larger brain. Any fool can tell which one was intelligent.\" \"Really?\" The professor laughed to himself, as if all this was so simple and obvious, it was just a crying shame to waste time on it. \"You judge everything from the type of brain human beings have managed to develop. Evolution has different ways of doing things. Birds fly one way; bats Ay another way. Life has plenty of tricks for everything. - How much of your brain do you think you use. About a fifth. That\u0027s what the psychologists say. As far as they know, as far as anybody knows, eighty per cent of your brain has no use at all. Everybody just works on way-low gear, except maybe a few in history. Leonardo da Vinci, for instance. Archimedes, Aristotle, Gauss, Galois, Einstein -\" I never heard of any of them except Einstein, but I didn\u0027t let on. He mentioned a few more, but I\u0027ve put in all I can remember. Then he said, \"Those little reptiles had tiny brains, maybe quarter-size, maybe even less, but they used it all - every hit of it. Their hones might not show it, but they were intelligent; intelligent as humans. And they were boss of all Earth.\" And then Joe came up with something that was really good. For a while I was sure that he had the professor and I was awfully glad he came out with it. He said, \"Look, P\u0027fessor, if those lizards were so damned hot, why didn\u0027t they leave something behind? Where are their cities and their buildings and all the sort of stuff we keep finding of the cavemen, stone knives and things. Hell, if human beings got the heck off of Earth, think of the stuff we \u0027 d leave behind us. You couldn\u0027t walk a mile without falling over a city. And roads and things.\" But the professor just couldn\u0027t he stopped. He wasn\u0027t even shaken up. He just came right back with, \"You\u0027re still judging other forms of life by human standards. We build cities and roads and airports and the rest that goes with us - but they didn\u0027t. They were built on a different plan. Their whole way of life was different from the ground up. They didn\u0027t live in cities. They didn\u0027t have our kind of art. I\u0027m not sure what they did have because it was so alien I couldn\u0027t grasp it - except for their guns. Those would be the same. Funny, isn\u0027t it. - For all I know, maybe we stumble over their relics every day and don\u0027t even know that\u0027s what they are.\" I was pretty sick of it by that time. You just couldn \u0027 t get him. The cuter you\u0027d be, the cuter he\u0027d be. I said, \"Look here. How do you know so much about those things? What did you do; live with them? Or did they speak English? Or maybe you speak lizard talk. Give us a few words of lizard talk.\" I guess I was getting mad, too. You know how it is. A guy tells you something you don\u0027t believe because it\u0027s all cockeyed, and you can\u0027t get him to admit he\u0027s lying. But the professor wasn\u0027t mad. He was just filling the glass again, very slowly. \"No,\" he said, \"I didn\u0027t talk and they didn\u0027t talk. They just looked at me with their cold, hard, staring eyes - snake\u0027s eyes - and I knew what they were thinking, and I could see that they knew what I was thinking. Don\u0027t ask me how it happened. It just did. Everything. I knew that they were out on a hunting expedition and I knew they weren\u0027t going to let me go.\" And we stopped asking questions. We just looked at him, then Ray said, \"What happened? How did you get away?\" \"That was easy. An animal scurried past on the hilltop. It was long - maybe ten feet - and narrow and ran close to the ground. The lizards got excited. I could feel the excitement in waves. It was as if they forgot about me in a single hot flash of blood lust - and off they went. I got back in the machine, returned, and broke it up.\" It was the flattest sort of ending you ever heard. Joe made a noise in his throat. \"Well, what happened to the dinosaurs?\" \"Oh, you don\u0027t see? I thought it was plain enough. - It was those little intelligent lizards that did it. They were hunters - by instinct and by choice. It was their hobby in life. It wasn\u0027t for food; it was for fun.\" \"And they just wiped out all the dinosaurs on the Earth?\" \"All that lived at the time, anyway; all the contemporary species. Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s possible? How long did it take us to wipe out bison herds by the hundred million? What happened to the dodo in a few years? Supposing we really put our minds to it, how long would the lions and the tigers and the giraffes last? Why, by the time I saw those lizards there wasn\u0027t any big game left - no reptile more than fifteen feet maybe. All gone. Those little demons were chasing the little, scurrying ones, and probably crying their hearts out for the good old days.\" And we all kept quiet and looked at our empty beer bottles and thought about it. All those dinosaurs - big as houses - killed by little lizards with guns. Killed for fun. Then Joe leaned over and put his hand on the professor\u0027s shoulder, easylike, and shook it. He said, \"Hey, P\u0027fessor, but if that\u0027s so, what happened to the little lizards with the guns? Huh? - Did you ever go back to find out?\" The professor looked up with the kind of look in his eyes that he\u0027d have if he were lost. \"You still don\u0027t see! It was already beginning to happen to them. I saw it in their eyes. They were running out of big game- the fun was going nut of it. So what did you expect them to do? They turned to other game - the biggest and most dangerous of all - and really had fun. They hunted that game to the end.\" \"What game?\" asked Ray. He didn\u0027t get it, but Joe andI did. \"Themselves,\" said the professor in a loud voice. \"They finished off all the others and began on themselves - till not one was left.\" And again we stopped and thought about those dinosaurs - big as houses - all finished off by little lizards with guns. Then we thought about the little lizards and how they had to keep the guns going even when there was nothing to use them on but themselves. Joe said, \"Poor dumb lizards.\" \"Yeah,\" said Ray, \"poor crackpot lizards.\" And then what happened really scared us. Because the professor jumped up with eyes that looked as if they were trying to climb right out of their sockets and leap at us. He shouted, \"You damned fools. Why do you sit there slobbering over reptiles dead a hundred million years. That was the first intelligence on Earth and that\u0027s how itended. That\u0027s done. But we\u0027re the second intelligence - and how the devil do you think we \u0027 re going to end?\" He pushed the chair over and headed for the door. But then he stood there just before leaving altogether and said: \"Poor dumb humanity! Go ahead and cry about that.\" The story, alas, seems to have a moral, and, in fact, ends by pounding that moral over the reader\u0027s head. That is bad. Straightforward preaching spoils the effectiveness of a story. If you can\u0027t resist the impulse to improve your fellow human beings, do it subtly. Occasionally I overflow and forget this good maxim. DAY OF THE HUNTERS was written not long after the Soviet Union had exploded its first fission bomb. It had been bad enough till then, knowing that the United States might be tempted to use fission bombs if sufficiently irritated (as in 1945). Now, for the first time, the possibility of a real nuclear war, one in which both sides used fission bombs, had arisen. We\u0027ve grown used to that situation now and scarcely think of it, but in 1950 there were many who thought a nuclear war was inevitable, and in short order, too. I was pretty bitter about that - and the bitterness shows in thestory.* [*Mankind\u0027s suicide seems now, a quarter century after DAY OF THE HUNTERS was written, to be more likely than ever, but for different reasons.] DAY OF THE HUNTERS is also told in the framework of a conversation, by the way. This one takes place in a bar. Wodehouse\u0027s stories about Mulliner, the stories set in Gavagan\u0027s Bar by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, and Clarke\u0027s stories about the White Hart were all set in bars, and I\u0027d read them a11 and loved them. It was inevitable, therefore, that someday I would tell a story in the form of a bar conversation. The only trouble is that I don\u0027t drink and have hardly ever sat in a bar, so I probably have it all wrong. My stay in Boston quickly proved to be no barrier to my literary career. (In fact, nothing since my concentration on my doctoral research in 1947 has proved to be a barrier.) After two months in a small sublet apartment (of slum quality) very close to the school, we moved to the suburbs - if you want to call it that. Neither my wife nor I could drive a car when we came to Boston so we had to find a place on the bus lines. We got one in the rather impoverished town of Somerville - an attic apartment of primitive sort that was unbelievably hot in the summer. There I wrote my secondnovel, THE STARS, LIKE DUST (Doubleday, 1951), and while there a small, one-man publishing firm, Gnome Press, put out a collection of my positronic robot stories, I, ROBOT, in 1950, and the first portion of my Foundation stories as FOUNDATION in 1951. [Gnome Press did not do well with these books or with FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE and SECOND FOUNDATION, which they published in 1951 and 1952. To my great relief, therefore, Doubleday, playing the role of White Knight on my behalf, pressured Gnome Press into relinquishing these books in 1962. Doubleday handled them thereafter and succeeded in earning (and is still continuing to earn) very substantial sums out of all of them for myself and for themselves.] In 1950 I learned to drive an automobile, and in 1951 we even had a son, rather to our surprise. After nine years of marriage we had rather come to the opinion that we were doomed to he childless. Late in 1950, however, it turned out that the explanation to some rather puzzling physiological manifestations was that my wife was pregnant. The first person to tell me that that must be so, I remember, was Evelyn Gold (she was then Mrs. Horace Gold). I laughed and said, \"No, no,\" but it was yes, yes, and David was horn on August 20, 1951. Having thus become prolific in books and having made a start in the direction of automobiles and offspring, I was ready for anything and began to accept all kinds of assignments. Among the many science fiction magazines of the early 1950s, for instance, there was one called Marvel Science Fiction. It was the reincarnation of an earlier Marvel that had published nine issues between 1938 and 1941. The earlier magazine had specialized in stories that accented sex in a rather heavy-handed and foolish manner. [In a very indirect way this eventually led to my writing a story called Playboy and the Slime God which appeared in the March 1961 Amazing stories and was then included in my collection NIGHTFALL AND OTHER STORIES under the much better title What Is This Thing Called Love? After Marvel was revived in 1950 (it lasted only for another half-dozen issues) I was asked for a story. I might have recalled the unsavory history of the magazine and refused to supply one, but I thought of a story I couldn\u0027t resist writing because, as all who know me are aware, I am an incorrigible punster.[I once asked a girl named Dawn if she had ever used one of those penny weighing machines on a trip to Florida she was telling me about. She said, \"No. Why?\"and I said because there was a song written about it. She said, \"What are you talking about?\" and I said, \"Haven\u0027t you heard \u0027Weigh Dawn Upon the Swanee river\u0027?\" and she chased me for five blocks before I got away.]The story was SHAH GUIDO G.and it appeared in the November 1951 issue of Marvel.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/buy-jupiter-and-other-stories/page-2.html","bookId":1732,"book":{"id":1732,"title":"Buy Jupiter and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: From backyard miracles to cosmic conundrums, enter the incredible world of Isaac Asimov.
