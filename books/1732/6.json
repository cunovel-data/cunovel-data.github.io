It was the photographs that kept them going.\n As photographs go, they weren\u0027t much; fuzzy, streaked, and with just dark blobs against the white to be interested in. But those dark blobs were living creatures. The men swore to it.\n I said, \"What the hell, they\u0027ve been talking about creatures skidding along the Everest glaciers for forty years. It\u0027s about time we did something about it.\"\n Jimmy Robbons (pardon me, James Abram Robbons) was the one who pushed me into that position. He was always nuts on mountain climbing, you see. He was the one who knew all about how the Tibetans wouldn\u0027t go near Everest because it was the mountain of the gods. He could quote me every mysterious manlike footprint ever reported in the ice twenty-five thousand feet up; he knew by heart every tall story about the spindly white creatures, speeding along the crags just over the last heart-breaking camp which the climbers had managed to establish.\n It\u0027s good to have one enthusiastic creature of the sort at Planetary Survey headquarters.\n The last photographs put bite into his words, though. After all, you might just barely think they were men.\n Jimmy said, \"Look, boss, the point isn\u0027t that they\u0027re there, the point is that they move fast. Look at that figure. It\u0027s blurred.\"\n \"The camera might have moved.\"\n \"The crag here is sharp enough. And the men swear it was running. Imagine the metabolism it must have to run at that oxygen pressure. Look, boss, would you have believed in deep-sea fish if you\u0027d never heard of them? You have fish which are looking for new niches in environment which they can exploit, so they go deeper and deeper into the abyss until one day they find they can\u0027t return.\n They\u0027ve adapted so thoroughly they can live only under tons of pressure.\"\n \"Well-\"\n \"Damn it, can\u0027t you reverse the picture? Creatures can be forced up a mountain, can\u0027t they? They can learn to stick it out in thinner air and colder temperatures. They can live on moss or on occasional birds, just as the deep-sea fish in the last analysis live on the upper fauna that slowly go filtering down. Then, someday, they find they can\u0027t go down again. I don\u0027t even say they\u0027re men. They can be chamois or mountain goats or badgers or anything.\"\n I said stubbornly, \"The witnesses said they were vaguely manlike, and the reported footprints are certainly manlike.\"\n \"Or bearlike,\" said Jimmy. \"You can\u0027t tell.\"\n So that\u0027s when I said, \"It\u0027s about time we did something about it.\"\n Jimmy shrugged and said, \"They\u0027ve been trying to climb Mount Everest for forty years.\" And he shook his head.\n \"For gossake,\" I said. \" All you mountain climbers are nuts. That\u0027s for sure. You\u0027re not interested in getting to the top. You\u0027re just interested in getting to the top in a certain way. It\u0027s about time we stopped fooling around with picks, ropes, camps, and all the paraphernalia of the Gentlemen\u0027s Club that sends suckers up the slopes every five years or so.\"\n \"What are you getting at?\"\n \"They invented the airplane in 1903, you know?\"\n \"You mean fly over Mount Everest!\" He said it the way an English lord would say, \"Shoot a fox!\" or an angler would say, \"Use worms!\"\n \"Yes,\" I said, \"fly over Mount Everest and let someone down on the top. Why not?\"\n \"He won\u0027t live long. The fellow you let down, I mean.\"\n \"Why not?\" I asked again. \"You drop supplies and oxygen tanks, and the fellow wears a spacesuit. Naturally.\"\n It took time to get the Air Force to listen and to agree to send a plane and by that time Jimmy Robbons had swiveled his mind to the point where he volunteered to be the one to land on Everest\u0027s peak. \"After all,\" he said in a half whisper, \"I\u0027d be the first man ever to stand there.\"\n That\u0027s the beginning of the story. The story itself can be told very simply, and in far fewer words.\n The plane waited two weeks during the best part of the year (as far as Everest was concerned, that is) for a siege of only moderately nasty flying weather, then took off. They made it. The pilot reported by radio to a listening group exactly what the top of Mount Everest looked like when seen from above and then he described exactly how Jimmy Robbons looked as his parachute got smaller and smaller.\n Then another blizzard broke and the plane barely made it back to base and it was another two weeks before the weather was bearable again.\n And all that time Jimmy was on the roof of the world by himself and I hated myself for a murderer.\n The plane went back up two weeks later to see if they could spot his body. I don\u0027t know what good it would have done if they had, but that\u0027s the human race for you. How many dead in the last war? Who can count that high? But money or anything else is no object to the saving of one life, or even the recovering of one body.\n They didn\u0027t find his body, but they did find a smoke signal; curling up in the thin air and whipping away in the gusts. They let down a grapple and Jimmy came up, still in his spacesuit, looking like hell, but definitely alive.\n The p.s. to the story involves my visit to the hospital last week to see him. He was recovering very slowly. The doctors said shock, they said exhaustion, but Jimmy\u0027s eyes said a lot more.\n I said, \"How about it, Jimmy, you haven\u0027t talked to the reporters, you haven\u0027t talked to the government. All right How about talking to me?\"\n \"I\u0027ve got nothing to say,\" he whispered. \"Sure you have,\" I said. \"You lived on top of Mount Everest during a two-week blizzard. You didn\u0027t do that by yourself, not with all the supplies we dumped along with you. Who helped you, Jimmy boy?\"\n I guess he knew there was no use trying to bluff. Or maybe he was anxious to get it off his mind.\n He said, \"They\u0027re intelligent, boss. They compressed air for me. They set up a little power pack to keep me warm. They set up the smoke signal when they spotted the airplane coming back.\"\n \"I see.\" I didn\u0027t want to rush him. \"It\u0027s like we thought. They\u0027ve adapted to Everest life. They can\u0027t come down the slopes.\"\n \"No, they can\u0027t. And we can\u0027t go up the slopes. Even if the weather didn\u0027t stop us, they would!\"\n \"They sound like kindly creatures, so why should they object? They helped you.\"\n \"They have nothing against us. They spoke to me, you know. Telepathy.\"\n I frowned. \"Well, then.\"\n \"But they don\u0027t intend to be interfered with. They\u0027re watching us, boss. They\u0027ve got to. We\u0027ve got atomic power. We\u0027re about to have rocket ships. They\u0027re worried about us. And Everest is the only place they can watch us from!\"\n I frowned deeper. He was sweating and his hands were shaking.\n I said, \"Easy, boy. Take it easy. What on Earth are these creatures?\"\n And he said, \"What do you suppose would be so adapted to thin air and subzero cold that Everest would be the only livable place on earth to them. That\u0027s the whole point. They\u0027re nothing at all on Earth. They\u0027re Martians.\"\n And that\u0027s it.\n And now let me explain the reason I frequently discuss\n EVEREST. Naturally, I did not actually believe that there were Martians on Mount Everest or that anything would long delay the eventual conquest of the mountain. I just thought that people would have the decency to refrain from climbing it until the story was published.\n But no! On May 29, 1953, less than two months after Ihad written and sold EVEREST, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood upon Everest\u0027s highest point and saw neither Martians nor Abominable Snowmen.\n Of course, Universe might have sacrificed thirty dollars and left the story unpublished; or I might have offered to buy back the story. Neither of us made the gesture and EVEREST appeared in the December 1953 issue of Universe.\n Since I am frequently called on to discuss the future of man, I can\u0027t help using EVEREST to point out what an expert futurist I am. After all, I predicted that Mount Everest would never be climbed, five months after it was climbed.\n Nowadays it is quite fashionable to publish anthologies of original science fiction stories, and I rather disapprove of this. It drains off some of the stories and readers that might otherwise go to the magazines. I don\u0027t want that to happen. I think that magazines are essential to science fiction.\n Is my feeling born of mere nostalgia? Does it arise out of the memory of what science fiction magazines meant to me in my childhood and of how they gave me my start as a writer? In part, yes, I suppose; but in part it is the result of an honest feeling that they do playa vital role.\n Where can a young writer get a start? Magazines, appearing six or twelve times a year, simply must have stories. An anthology can delay publication till the desired stories come in; a magazine cannot. Driven by unswervable deadlines, a magazine must accept an occasional substandard story, and an occasional young writer gets a start while he is still perhaps of only marginal quality. That was how I got my start, in fact.\n It means, to be sure, that the reader is subjected to an occasional amateurish story in the magazine, but the amateur writer who wrote it gets enough encouragementto continue working and to become (just possibly) a great writer.\n When the anthologies of original science fiction first appeared, however, they were novelties. I never really thought they would come to much, and had no feeling of contributing to an impending doom when I wrote for them. In fact, since they paid better than the magazines usually did, I felt good about writing for them.\n The first of the breed was New Tales of Space and Time, edited by Raymond J. Healy (Henry Holt, 1951),\n and for it I wrote In a Good Cause-a story that was eventually included in NIGHTFALL AND OTHER STORIES.\n A few years later, August Derleth was editing an anthology of originals, and for it I wrote THE PAUSE. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/buy-jupiter-and-other-stories/page-6.html","bookId":1732,"book":{"id":1732,"title":"Buy Jupiter and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n From backyard miracles to cosmic conundrums, enter the incredible world of Isaac Asimov.
