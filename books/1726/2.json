{"id":68622,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Loa Maren and her stolid husband, Arbin, played cards in the cool of the same evening, while the older man in the motor-driven wheel chair in the corner rustled his newspaper angrily and caned, \" Arbin!\" Arbin Maren did not answer at once. He fingered the thin, smooth rectangles carefully as he considered the next play. Then, as he slowly made his decision, he responded with an absent, \"What do you want, Grew?\" The grizzled Grew regarded his son-in-law fiercely over the top of the paper and rustled it again. He found noise of that sort a great relief to his feelings. When a man teems with energy and finds himself spiked to a wheel chair with two dead sticks for legs, there must be something, by Space, he can do to express himself. Grew used his newspaper. He rustled it; he gestured with it; when necessary, he swatted at things with it. Elsewhere than on Earth, Grew knew, they had telenews machines that issued rolls of microfilm as servings of current news. Standard book viewers were used for them. But Grew sneered silently at that. An effete and degenerate custom! Grew said, \"Did you read about the archaeological expedition they\u0027re sending to Earth?\" \"No, I haven\u0027t,\" said Arbin calmly. Grew knew that, since nobody but himself had seen the paper yet, and the family had given up their video last year. But then his remark had simply been in the nature of an opening gambit, anyway. He said, \"Well, there\u0027s one coming. And on an Imperial grant, too, and how do you like that?\" He began reciting in the queer unevenness of tone that most people somehow assume automatically when reading aloud, \" \u0027Bel Arvardan, Senior Research Associate at the Imperial Archaeological Institute, in an interview granted the Galactic Press, spoke hopefully of the expected valuable results of archaeological studies which are being projected upon the planet Earth, located on the outskirts of the Sirius Sector (see map). \"Earth,\" he said, \"with its archaic civilization and its unique environment, offers a freak culture which has been too long neglected by our social scientists, except as a difficult exercise in local government. I have every expectation that the next year or two will bring about revolutionary changes in some of our supposed fundamental concepts of social evolution and human history.\" And so on and so on,\" he finished with a flourish. Arbin Maren had been listening with only half an ear. He mumbled, \"What does he mean, \u0027freak culture\u0027?\" Loa Maren hadn\u0027t been listening at all. She simply said. \"It\u0027s your play, Arbin.\" Grew went on, \"Well, aren\u0027t you going to ask me why the Tribune printed it? You know they wouldn\u0027t print a Galactic Press release for a million Imperial Credits without a good reason.\" He waited uselessly for an answer, then said, \"Because they have an editorial on it. A full-page editorial that blasts the living daylights out of this guy Arvardan. Here\u0027s a fellow wants to come here for scientific purposes and they\u0027re choking themselves purple to keep him out. Look at this piece of rabble-rousing. Look at it!\" He shook the paper at them. \"Read it, why don\u0027t you?\" Loa Maren put down her cards and clamped her thin lips firmly together. \"Father,\" she said, \"we\u0027ve had a hard day, so let\u0027s not have politics just now. Later, maybe, eh? Please, Father.\" Grew scowled and mimicked, \" \u0027Please, Father! Please, Father.\u0027 It appears to me you must be getting pretty tired of your old father when you begrudge him a few quiet words on current events. I\u0027m in your way, I suppose, sitting here in the comer and letting you two work for three...Whose fault is it? I\u0027m strong. I\u0027m willing to work. And you know I could get my legs treated and be as well as ever.\" He slapped them as he spoke: hard. savage, ringing slaps, which he heard but did not feel. \"The only reason I can\u0027t is because I\u0027m getting too old to make a cure worth their while. Don\u0027t you can that a \u0027freak culture\u0027? What else could you can a world where a man can work but they won\u0027t let him? By Space, I think it\u0027s about time we stopped this nonsense about our so-called \u0027peculiar institutions.\u0027 They\u0027re not just peculiar; they\u0027re cracked! I think-\" He was waving his arms and angry blood was reddening his face. But Arbin had risen from his chair, and his grip was strong on the older man\u0027s shoulder. He said, \"Now where\u0027s the call to be upset, Grew? When you\u0027re through with the paper, I\u0027ll read the editorial.\" \"Sure, but you\u0027ll agree with them, so what\u0027s the use? You young ones are a bunch of milksops; just sponge rubber in the hands of the Ancients.\" And Loa said sharply, \"Quiet, Father. Don\u0027t start that.\" She sat there listening for a moment. She could not have said exactly what for, but... Arbin felt that cold little prickle that always came when the Society of Ancients was mentioned. It just wasn\u0027t safe to talk as Grew did, to mock Earth\u0027s ancient culture, to-to- Why, it was rank Assimilationism. He swallowed earnestly; the word was an ugly one, even when confined to thought. Of course in Grew\u0027s youth there had been much of this foolish talk of abandoning the old ways, but these were different times. Grew should know that-and he probably did, except that it wasn\u0027t easy to be reasonable and sensible when you were in a wheel-chair prison, just waiting away your days for the next Census. Grew was perhaps the least affected, but he said no more. And as the moments passed he grew quieter and the print became progressively more difficult to place in focus. He had not yet had time to give the sports pages a detailed and critical perusal when his nodding head lolled slowly down upon his chest. He snored softly, and the paper fell from his fingers with a final, unintentional rustle. Then Loa spoke, in a worried whisper. \"Maybe we\u0027re not being kind to him, Arbin. It\u0027s a hard life for a man like Father. It\u0027s like being dead compared to the life he used to lead.\" \"Nothing\u0027s like being dead, Loa. He has his papers and his books. Let him be! A bit of excitement like this peps him up. He\u0027ll be happy and quiet for days now.\" Arbin was beginning to consider his cards again, and as he reached for one the pounding at the door sounded, with hoarse yells that didn\u0027t quite coalesce into words. Arbin\u0027s hand lurched and stopped. Loa\u0027s eyes grew fearful; she stared at her husband with a trembling lower lip. Arbin said, \"Get Grew out of here. Quickly!\" Loa was at the wheel chair as he spoke. She made soothing sounds with her tongue. But the sleeping figure gasped, startled awake at the first motion of the chair. He straightened and groped automatically for his paper. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" he demanded irritably, and by no means in a whisper. \"Shh. It\u0027s all right,\" muttered Loa vaguely, and wheeled the chair into the next room. She closed the door and placed her back against it, thin chest heaving as her eyes sought those of her husband. There was that pounding again. They stood close to each other as the door opened, almost defensively so, and hostility peeped from them as they faced the short, plump man who smiled faintly at them. Loa said, \"Is there anything we can do for you?\" with a ceremonial courtesy, then jumped back as the man gasped and put out a hand to stop himself from falling. \"Is he sick?\" asked Arbin bewilderedly. \"Here, help me take him inside.\" The hours after that passed, and in the quiet of their bedroom Loa and Arbin prepared slowly for bed. \"Arbin,\" said Loa. \"What is it?\" \"Is it safe?\" \"Safe?\" He seemed to avoid her meaning deliberately. \"I mean, taking this man into the house. Who is he?\" \"How should I know?\" was the irritated response. \"But, after an, we can\u0027t refuse shelter to a sick man. Tomorrow, if he lacks identification, we\u0027ll inform the Regional Security Board, and that will be the end of it.\" He turned away in an obvious attempt at breaking off the conversation. But his wife broke the returning silence, her thin voice more urgent. \"you don\u0027t think he might be an agent of the Society of Ancients, do you? There\u0027s Grew, you know.\" \"You mean because of what he said tonight? That\u0027s past the limit of reason. I won\u0027t argue about it.\" \"I don\u0027t mean that, and you know it. I mean that we\u0027ve been keeping Grew illegally now for two years, and you know we\u0027re breaking just about the most serious Custom.\" Arbin muttered, \"We\u0027re harming no one. We\u0027re fining our quota, aren\u0027t we, even though it\u0027s set for three people-three workers? And if we are, why should they suspect anything? We don\u0027t even let him out of the house.\" \"They might trace the wheel chair. You had to buy the motor and fittings outside.\" \"Now don\u0027t start that again, Loa. I\u0027ve explained many times that I\u0027ve bought nothing but standard kitchen equipment for that chair. Besides, it does not make any sense at all to consider him an agent of the Brotherhood. Do you suppose that they would go through such an elaborate trickery for the sake of a poor old man in a wheel chair? Couldn\u0027t they enter by daylight and with legal search warrants? Please, reason this thing out.\" \"Well, then, Arbin\"-her eyes were suddenly bright and eager-\"if you really think so-and I\u0027ve been so hoping you would-he must be an Outsider. He can\u0027t be an Earthman.\" \"What do you mean, he can\u0027t be? That\u0027s more ridiculous still. Why should a man of the Empire come here to Earth, of all places?\" \"I don\u0027t know why! Yes, I do; maybe he\u0027s committed a crime out there.\" She was caught up instantly in her own fancy. \"Why not? It makes sense. Earth would be the natural place to come to. Who would ever think of looking for him here?\" \"If he\u0027s an Outsider. What evidence do you have for that?\" \"He doesn\u0027t speak the language, does he? You\u0027ll have to grant me that. Could you understand a single word? So he must come from some far-off corner of the Galaxy where the dialect is strange. They say the men of Fomalhaut have to learn practically a new language to be understood at the Emperor\u0027s court on Trantor...But don\u0027t you see what all this can mean? If he\u0027s a stranger on Earth, he will have no registration with the Census Board, and he will be only too glad to avoid reporting to them. We can use him on the farm, in the place of Father, and it will be three people again, not two, who will have to meet the quota for three this next season...He could even help with the harvest now.\" She looked anxiously at the uncertain face of her husband, who considered long, then said, \"Well, go to bed, Loa. We\u0027ll speak further in the common sense of daylight.\" The whispering ended, the light was put out, and eventually sleep filled the room and the house. The next morning it was Grew\u0027s turn to consider the matter. Arbin put the question to him hopefully. He felt a confidence in his father-in-law that he could not muster in himself. Grew said, \"Your troubles, Arbin, obviously arise from the fact that I am registered as a worker, so that the produce quota is set at three. I\u0027m tired of creating trouble. This is the second year I have lived past my time. It is enough.\" Arbin was embarrassed...Now that wasn\u0027t the point at an. I\u0027m not hinting that you\u0027re a trouble to us.\" \"Well, after an, what\u0027s the difference? In two years there will be the Census, and I will go anyway.\" \"At least you will have two more years of your books and your rest. Why should you be deprived of that?\" \"Because others are. And what of you and Loa? When they come to take me, they will take you two as well. What kind of a man would I be to live a few stinking/ years at the expense-\" \"Stop it, Grew. I don\u0027t want histrionics. We\u0027ve told you many times what we\u0027re going to do. We\u0027ll report you a week before the Census. \" \"And fool the doctor, I suppose?\" \"We\u0027ll bribe the doctor.\" \"Hmp. And this new man-he\u0027ll double the offense. You\u0027ll be concealing him too.\" \"We\u0027ll turn him loose. For Space\u0027s sake, why bother about this now? We have two years. What shall we do with him?\" \"A stranger,\" mused Grew. \"He comes knocking at the door. He\u0027s from nowhere. He speaks unintelligibly...I don\u0027t know what to advise.\" The farmer said, \"He is mild-mannered; seems frightened to death. He can\u0027t do us any harm.\" \"Frightened, eh? What if he\u0027s feeble-minded? What if his babbling isn\u0027t a foreign dialect at an, but just insane mouthing?\" \"That doesn\u0027t sound likely.\" But Arbin stirred uneasily. \"You tell yourself that because you want to use him... All right, I\u0027ll tell you what to do. Take him into town.\" \"To Chica?\" Arbin was horrified. \"That would be ruin.\" \"Not at all,\" said Grew calmly. \"The trouble with you is that you don\u0027t read the newspapers. Fortunately for this family, I do. It so happens that the Institute for Nuclear Research has developed an instrument that is supposed to make it easier for people to learn. There was a full-page spread in the Week-end Supplement. And they want volunteers. Take this man. Let him be a volunteer.\" Arbin shook his head firmly. \"You\u0027re mad. I couldn\u0027t do anything like that, Grew. They\u0027ll ask for his registration number first thing. It\u0027s only inviting investigation to have things in improper order, and then they\u0027ll find out about you.\" \"No, they won\u0027t. It so happens you\u0027re all wrong, Arbin. The reason the Institute wants volunteers is that the machine is still experimental. It\u0027s probably killed a few people, so I\u0027m sure they won\u0027t ask questions. And if the stranger dies, he\u0027ll probably be no worse off than he is now...Here, Arbin, hand me the book projector and set the mark at reel six. And bring me the paper as soon as it comes, will you?\" When Schwartz opened his eyes, it was past noon. He felt that dun, heart-choking pain that feeds on itself, the pain of a wife no longer by his side at waking, of a familiar world lost... Once before he had felt such a pain, and that momentary flash of memory came, lighting up a forgotten scene into sharp brilliance. There was himself, a youngster, in the snow of the wintry village...with the sleigh waiting...at the end of whose journey would be the train...and, after that, the great ship... The longing, frustrating fear for the world of the familiar united him for the moment with that twenty-year-old who had emigrated to America. The frustration was too real. This could not be a dream. He jumped up as the light above the door blinked on and off and the meaningless baritone of his host sounded. Then the door opened and there was breakfast-a mealy porridge that he did not recognize but which tasted faintly like corn mush (with a savory difference) and milk. He said, \"Thanks,\" and nodded his head vigorously. The farmer said something in return and picked up Schwartz\u0027s shirt from where it hung on the back of the chair. He inspected it carefully from an directions, paying particular attention to the buttons. Then, replacing it, he flung open the sliding door of a closet, and for the first time Schwartz became visually aware of the warm milkiness of the walls. \"Plastic,\" he muttered to himself, using that all-inclusive word with the finality laymen always do. He noted further that there were no corners or angles in the room, all planes fading into each other at a gentle curve. But the other was holding objects out toward him and was making gestures that could not be mistaken. Schwartz obviously was to wash and dress. With help and directions, he obeyed. Except that he found nothing with which to shave, nor could gestures to his chin elicit anything but an incomprehensible sound accompanied by a look of distinct revulsion on the part of the other. Schwartz scratched at his gray stubble and sighed windily. And then he was led to a small, elongated, biwheeled car, into which he was ordered by gestures. The ground sped beneath them and the empty road moved backward on either side, until low, sparkling white buildings rose before him, and there, far ahead, was the blue of water. He pointed eagerly. \"Chicago?\" It was the last gasp of hope within him, for certainly nothing he ever saw looked less like that city. The farmer made no answer at all. And the last hope died.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-2.html","bookId":1726,"book":{"id":1726,"title":"Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3)","description":"Storyline: Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3) One moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in Chicago, 1949.
