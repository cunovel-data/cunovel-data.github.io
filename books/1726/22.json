He had not returned; not, at least, until he had destroyed the Temple of Senloo. The heroism was finally made official now. In his pocket he had the ribbon of the Order of the/Spaceship and Sun, First Class. Only two others in all the Galaxy had ever gotten it nonposthumously. That was something for a retired tailor. No one, of course, outside the most official of officialdom, knew exactly what he had done, but that didn\u0027t matter. Some. day, in the history books, it would all become part of a bright and indelible record. He was walking through the quiet night now toward Dr. Shekt\u0027s house. The city was peaceful, as peaceful as the starry glitter above. In isolated places on Earth bands of Zealots still made trouble, but their leaders were dead or captive and the moderate Earthmen, themselves, could take care of the rest. The first huge convoys of normal soil were already on their way. Ennius had again made his original proposal that Earth\u0027s population be moved to another planet, but that was out. Charity was not wanted. Let Earthmen have a chance to remake their own planet. Let them build once again the home of their fathers, the native world of man. Let them labor with their hands, removing the diseased soil and replacing it with healthy, seeing the green grow where all had been dead and making the desert blossom in beauty once again. It was an enormous job; it could take a century-but what of that? Let the Galaxy lend machinery; let the Galaxy ship food; let the Galaxy supply soil. Of their incalculable resources, it would be a trifle-and it would be repaid. And someday, once again, the Earthman would be a people among peoples, inhabiting a planet among planets, looking all humanity in the eye in dignity and equality. Schwartz\u0027s heart pounded at the wonder of it an as he walked up the steps to the front door. Next week he left with Arvardan for the great central worlds of the Galaxy. Who else of his generation had ever left Earth? And momentarily he thought of the old Earth, his Earth. So long dead. So long dead. And yet but three and a half months had passed... He paused, his hand on the point of signaling at the door, as the words from within sounded in his mind. How clearly he heard thoughts now, like tiny bells. It was Arvardan, of course, with more in his mind than words alone could ever handle. \"Pola, I\u0027ve waited and thought, and thought and waited. I won\u0027t any more. You\u0027re coming with me.\" And Pola, with a mind as eager as his, yet with words of the purest reluctance, said, \"I couldn\u0027t, Bel. It\u0027s quite impossible. My backwoods manners and bearing...I\u0027d feel silly in those big worlds out there. And, besides, I\u0027m only an Ear-\" \"Don\u0027t say it. You\u0027re my wife, that\u0027s an. If anyone asks what and who you are, you\u0027re a native of Earth and a citizen of the Empire. If they want further details, you\u0027re my wife.\" \"Well, and after you make this address at Trantor to your archaeological society, what next?\" \"What next? Well, first we take a year off and see every major world in the Galaxy. We won\u0027t skip one, even if we have to get on and off it by mail ship. You\u0027ll get yourself an eyeful of the Galaxy and the best honeymoon that government money can buy.\" \"And then...\" \"And then it\u0027s back to Earth, and we\u0027ll volunteer for the labor battalions and spend the next forty years of our lives lugging dirt to replace the radioactive areas.\" \"Now why are you going to do that?\" \"Because\"-there was the suspicion of a deep breath at this point in Arvardan\u0027s Mind Touch-\"I love you and it\u0027s what you want, and because I\u0027m a patriotic Earthman and have the honorary naturalization papers to prove it. \" \"All right...\" And at this point the conversation stopped. But, of course, the Mind Touches did not, and Schwartz, in full satisfaction, and a little embarrassment, backed away. He could wait. Time enough to disturb them when things had settled down further. He waited in the street, with the cold stars burning down-a whole Galaxy of them, seen and unseen. And for himself, and the new Earth, and all those millions of planets far beyond, he repeated softly once more that ancient poem that he alone now, of so many quadrillions, knew: \"Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be, The last of life, for which the first was made...\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-22.html","bookId":1726,"book":{"id":1726,"title":"Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3)","description":"Storyline: Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3) One moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in Chicago, 1949. The next he\u0027s a helpless stranger on Earth during the heyday of the first Galactic Empire. Earth, as he soon learns, is a backwater, just a \"pebble in the sky\", despised by all the other 200 million planets of the Empire because its people dare to claim it\u0027s the original home of man. And Earth is poor, with great areas of radioactivity ruining much of its soilâ€”so poor that everyone is sentenced to death at the age of sixty to conserve resources. Joseph Schwartz is sixty-two. This is the young Isaac Asimov\u0027s first novel, full of wonders and ideas, the book that launched the novels of the Galactic Empire, culminating in the Foundation series. This is Golden Age SF at its finest.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:49 AM"}}
