{"id":68627,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"As for Arvardan, he was concerned only with making holiday. His ship, the Ophiuchus, was not to be expected for at least a month, therefore he had a month to spend as lavishly as he might wish. So it was that on the sixth day after his arrival at Everest, Bel Arvardan left his host and took passage on the Terrestrial Air Transport Company\u0027s largest jet Stratospheric, traveling between Everest and the Terrestrial capital, Washenn. If he took a commercial liner, rather than the speedy cruiser placed at his service by Ennius, it was done deliberately, out of the reasonable curiosity of a stranger and an archaeologist toward the ordinary life of men inhabiting such a planet as Earth. And for another reason too. Arvardan was from the Sirian Sector, notoriously the sector above all others in the Galaxy where anti-Terrestrian prejudice was strong. Yet he had always liked to think he had not succumbed to that prejudice himself. As a scientist, as an archaeologist, he couldn\u0027t afford to. Of course he had grown into the habit of thinking of Earthmen in certain set caricature types, and even now the word \"Earthman \" seemed an ugly one to him. But he wasn\u0027t really prejudiced. At least he didn\u0027t think so. For instance, if an Earthman had ever wished to join an expedition of his or work for him in any capacity-and had the training and the ability-he would be accepted. If there were an opening for him, that was. And if the other members of the expedition didn\u0027t mind too much. That was the rub. Usually the fellow workers objected, and then what could you do? He pondered the matter. Now certainly he would have no objection to eating with an Earthman, or even bunking with one in case of need-assuming the Earthman were reasonably clean, and healthy. In fact, he would in all ways treat him as he would treat anyone else, he thought. Yet there was no denying that he would always be conscious of the fact that an Earthman was an Earthman. He couldn\u0027t help that. That was the result of a childhood immersed in an atmosphere of bigotry so complete that it was almost invisible, so entire that you accepted its axioms as second nature. Then you left it and saw it for what it was when you looked back. But here was his chance to test himself. He was in a plane with only Earthmen about him, and he felt perfectly natural, almost. Well, just a little self-conscious. Arvardan looked about at the undistinguished and normal faces of his fellow passengers. They were supposed to be different, these Earthmen, but could he have told these from ordinary men if he had met them casually in a crowd? He didn\u0027t think so. The women weren\u0027t bad-looking...His brows knit. Of course even tolerance must draw the line somewhere. Intermarriage, for instance, was quite unthinkable. The plane itself was, in his eyes, a small affair of imperfect construction. It was, of course, atomic-powered, but the application of the principle was far from efficient. For one thing, the power unit was not well shielded. Then it occurred to Arvardan that the presence of stray gamma rays and a high neutron density in the atmosphere might well strike Earthmen as less important than it might strike others. Then the view caught his eyes. From the dark wine-purple of the extreme stratosphere, Earth presented a fabulous appearance. Beneath him the vast and misted land areas in sight (obscured here and there by the patches of sun-bright clouds) showed a desert orange. Behind them, slowly receding from the fleeing stratoliner, was the soft and fuzzy night line, within whose dark shadow there was the sparking of the radioactive areas. His attention was drawn from the window by the laughter among the others. It seemed to center about an elderly couple, comfortably stout and all smiles. Arvardan nudged his neighbor. \"What\u0027s going on?\" His neighbor paused to say, \"They\u0027ve been married forty years, and they\u0027re making the Grand Tour.\" \"The Grand Tour?\" \"You know. All around the Earth.\" The elderly man, flushed with pleasure, was recounting in voluble fashion his experiences and impressions. His wife joined in periodically, with meticulous corrections involving completely unimportant points; these being given and taken in the best of humor. To all this the audience listened with the greatest attention, so that to Arvardan it seemed that Earthmen were as warm and human as any people in the Galaxy. And then someone asked, \"And when is it that you\u0027re scheduled for the Sixty?\" \"In about a month,\" came the ready, cheerful answer. \"Sixteenth November.\" \"Well,\" said the questioner, \"I hope you have a nice day for it. My father reached his Sixty in a damned pouring rain. I\u0027ve never seen one like it since. I was going with him-you know, a fellow likes company on a day like that-and he complained about the rain every step of the way. We had an open biwheel, you see, and we got soaked. \u0027Listen,\u0027 I said, \u0027what are you complaining about, Dad? I\u0027ve got to come back.\u0027 \" There was a general howl of laughter which the anniversary couple were not backward in joining. Arvardan, however, felt plunged in horror as a distinct and uncomfortable suspicion entered his mind. He said to the man sharing his seat, \"This Sixty, this subject of conversation here-I take it they\u0027re referring to euthanasia. I mean, you\u0027re put out of the way when you reach your sixtieth birthday, aren\u0027t you?\" Arvardan\u0027s voice faded somewhat as his neighbor choked off the last of his chuckles to turn in his seat and favor the questioner with a long and suspicious stare. Finally he said, \"Well, what do you think he meant?\" Arvardan made an indefinite gesture with his hand and smiled rather foolishly. He had known of the custom, but only academically. Something in a book. Something discussed in a scientific paper. But it was now borne in upon him that it actually applied to living beings, that the men and women surrounding him could, by custom, live only to sixty. The man next to him was still staring. \"Hey, fella, where you from? Don\u0027t they know about the Sixty in your home town?\" \"We call it the \u0027Time,\u0027 \" said Arvardan feebly. \"I\u0027m from back there.\" He jerked his thumb hard over his shoulder, and after an additional quarter minute the other withdrew that hard, questioning stare. Arvardan\u0027s lips quirked. These people were suspicious. That facet of the caricature, at least, was authentic. The elderly man was talking again. \"She\u0027s coming with me,\" he said, nodding toward his genial wife. \"She\u0027s not due for about three months after that, but there\u0027s no point in her waiting, she thinks, and we might as well go together. Isn\u0027t that it, Chubby?\" \"Oh yes,\" she said, and giggled rosily. \"Our children are all married and have homes of their own. I\u0027d just be a bother to them. Besides, I couldn\u0027t enjoy the time anyway without the old fellow-so we\u0027ll just leave off together.\" Whereupon the entire list of passengers seemed to engage themselves in a simultaneous arithmetical calculation of the time remaining to each-a process involving conversion factors from months to days that occasioned several disputes among the married couples involved. One small fellow with tight clothes and a determined expression said fiercely, \"I\u0027ve got exactly twelve years, three months, and four days left. Twelve years, three months, and four days. Not a day more, not a day less.\" Which someone qualified by saying, reasonably, \"Unless you die first, of course.\" \"Nonsense,\" was the immediate reply. \"I have no intention of dying first. Do I look like the sort of man who would die first? I\u0027m living twelve years, three months, and four days, and there\u0027s not a man here with the hardihood to deny it.\" And he looked very fierce indeed. A slim young man took a long, dandyish cigarette from between his lips to say darkly, \"It\u0027s well for them that can calculate it out to a day. There\u0027s many a man living past his time.\" \"Ah, surely,\" said another, and there was a general nod and a rather inchoate air of indignation arose. \"Not,\" continued the young man, interspersing his cigarette puffs with a complicated flourish intended to remove the ash, \"that I see any objection to a man-or woman-wishing, to continue on past their birthday to the next Council day, particularly if they have some business to clean up. It\u0027s these sneaks and parasites that try to go past to the next Census, eating the food of the next generation-\" He seemed to have a personal grievance there. Arvardan interposed gently, \"But aren\u0027t the ages of everyone registered? They can\u0027t very well pass their birthday too far, can they?\" A general silence followed, admixtured not a little with contempt at the foolish idealism expressed. Someone said at last, in diplomatic fashion, as though attempting to conclude the subject, \"Well, there isn\u0027t much point living past the Sixty, I suppose.\" \"Not if you\u0027re a farmer,\" shot back another vigorously. \" After you\u0027ve been working in the fields for half a century, you\u0027d be crazy not to be glad to call it off. How about the administrators, though, and the businessmen?\" Finally the elderly man, whose fortieth wedding anniversary had begun the conversation, ventured his own opinion, emboldened perhaps by the fact that, as a current victim of the Sixty, he had nothing to lose. \"As to that,\" he said, \"it depends on who you know.\" And he winked with a sly innuendo. \"I knew a man once who was sixty the year after the 810 Census and lived till the 820 Census caught him. He was sixty-nine before he left off. Sixty-nine! Think of that!\" \"How did he manage that?\" \"He had a little money, and his brother was one of the Society of Ancients. There\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t do if you\u0027ve got that combination.\" There was general approval of that sentiment. \"Listen,\" said the young man with the cigarette emphatically, \"I had an uncle who lived a year past-just a year. He was just one of these selfish guys who don\u0027t feel like going, you know. A lot he cared for the rest of us...And I didn\u0027t know about it, you see, or I would have reported him, believe me, because a guy should go when it\u0027s his time. It\u0027s only fair to the next generation. Anyway, he got caught all right, and the first thing I knew, the Brotherhood calls on me and my brother and wants to know how come we didn\u0027t report him. I said, hell, I didn\u0027t know anything about it; nobody in my family knew anything about it. I said we hadn\u0027t seen him in ten years. My old man backed us up. But we got fined five hundred credits just the same. That\u0027s when you don\u0027t have any pull.\" The look of discomposure on Arvardan\u0027s face was growing. Were these people madmen to accept death so-to resent their friends and relatives who tried to escape death? Could he, by accident, be on a ship carrying a cargo of lunatics to asylum-or euthanasia? Or were these simply Earthmen? His neighbor was scowling at him again, and his voice broke in on Arvardan\u0027s thoughts. \"Hey fella, where\u0027s \u0027back there?\u0027\" \"Pardon me?\" \"I said-where are you from? You said \u0027back there.\u0027 What\u0027s \u0027back there\u0027? Hey?\" Arvardan found the eyes of all upon him now, each with its own sudden spark of suspicion in it. Did they think him a member of this Society of Ancients of theirs? Had his questioning seemed the cajolery of an agent provocateur? So he met that by saying, in a burst of frankness, \"I\u0027m not from anywhere on Earth. I\u0027m Bel Arvardan from Baronn, Sirius Sector. What\u0027s your name?\" And he held out his hand. He might as well have dropped an atomic explosive capsule into the middle of the plane. The first silent horror on every face turned rapidly into angry, bitter hostility that flamed at him. The man who had shared his seat rose stiffly and crowded into another, where the pair of occupants squeezed closely together to make room for him. Faces turned away. Shoulders surrounded him, hemmed him in. For a moment Arvardan burned with indignation. Earthmen to treat him so. Earthmen! He had held out the hand of friendship to them. He, a Sirian, had condescended to treat with them and they had rebuffed him. And then, with an effort, he relaxed. It was obvious that bigotry was never a one-way operation, that hatred bred hatred! He was conscious of a presence beside him, and he turned toward it resentfully. \"Yes?\" It was the young man with the cigarette. He was lighting a new one as he spoke. \"Hello,\" he said. \"My name\u0027s Creen... Don\u0027t let those jerks get you.\" \"No one\u0027s getting me,\" said Arvardan shortly. He was not too pleased with the company, nor was he in the mood for patronizing advice from an Earthman. But Creen was not trained to the detection of the more delicate nuances. He puffed his cigarette to life in man-sized drags and tapped its ashes over the arm of the seat into the middle aisle. \"Provincials!\" he whispered with contempt. \"Just a bunch of farmers...They lack the Galactic view. Don\u0027t bother with them...Now you take me. I got a different philosophy. Live and let live, I say. I got nothing against Outsiders. If they want to be friendly with me, I\u0027ll be friendly with them. What the hell-They can\u0027t help being an Outsider just like I can\u0027t help being an Earthman. Don\u0027t you think I\u0027m right?\" And he tapped Arvardan familiarly on the wrist. Arvardan nodded and felt a crawling sensation at the other\u0027s touch. Social contact with a man who felt resentful over losing a chance to bring about his uncle\u0027s death was not pleasant, quite regardless of planetary origin. Creen leaned back. \"Heading for Chica? What did you say your name was? Albadan?\" \"Arvardan. Yes, I\u0027m going to Chica.\" \"That\u0027s my home town. Best damned city on Earth. Going to stay there long?\" \"Maybe. I haven\u0027t made any plans.\" \"Umm...Say, I hope you don\u0027t object to my saying that I\u0027ve been noticing your shirt. Mind if I take a close look? Made in Sirius, huh?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"It\u0027s very good material. Can\u0027t get anything like that on Earth...Say, bud, you wouldn\u0027t have a spare shirt like that in your luggage, would you? I\u0027d pay for it if you wanted to sell it. It\u0027s a snappy number.\" Arvardan shook his head emphatically. \"Sorry, but I don\u0027t have much of a wardrobe. I am planning to buy clothes here on Earth as I go along.\" \"I\u0027ll pay you fifty credits,\" said Creen...Silence. He added, with a touch of resentment, \"That\u0027s a good price.\" \"A very good price,\" said Arvardan, \"but, as I told you, I have no shirts to sell.\" \"Well...\" Creen shrugged. \"Expect to stay on Earth quite a while, I suppose?\" \"Maybe.\" \"What\u0027s your line of business?\" The archaeologist allowed irritation to rise to the surface. \"Look, Mr. Creen, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027m a little tired and would like to take a nap. Is that all right with you?\" Creen frowned. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Don\u0027t your kind believe in being civil to people? I\u0027m just asking you a polite question; no need to bite my ear off.\" The conversation, hitherto conducted in a low voice, had suddenly amplified itself into a near shout. Hostile expressions turned Arvardan\u0027s way, and the archaeologist\u0027s lips compressed themselves into a thin line. He had asked for it, he decided bitterly. He would not have gotten into this mess if he had held aloof from the beginning, if he hadn\u0027t felt the necessity of vaunting his damned tolerance and forcing it on people who didn\u0027t want it. He said levelly, \"Mr. Creen, I didn\u0027t ask you to join me, and I haven\u0027t been uncivil. I repeat, I am tired and would like to rest. I think there\u0027s nothing unusual in that.\" \"Listen\"-the young man rose from his seat, threw his cigarette away with a violent gesture, and pointed a finger-\"you don\u0027t have to treat me like I\u0027m a dog or something. You stinking Outsiders come here with your fine talk and standoffishness and think it gives you the right to stamp all over us. We don\u0027t have to stand for it, see. If you don\u0027t like it here, you can go back where you came from, and it won\u0027t take much more of your lip to make me light into you, either. You think I\u0027m afraid of you?\" Arvardan turned his head away and stared stonily out the window. Creen said no more, but took his original seat once again. There was an excited buzz of conversation round and about the plane which Arvardan ignored. He felt, rather than saw, the sharpened and envenomed glances being cast at him. Until, gradually, it passed, as all things did. He completed the journey, silent and alone. The landing at the Chica airport was welcome. Arvardan smiled to himself at the first sight from the air of the \"best damned city on Earth,\" but found it, nevertheless, an immense improvement over the thick, unfriendly atmosphere of the plane. He supervised the unloading of his luggage and had it transferred into a biwheel cab. At least he would be the only passenger here, so that if he took care not to speak unnecessarily to the driver, he could scarcely get into trouble. \"State House,\" he told the cabby, and they were off. Arvardan thus entered Chica for the first time, and he did so on the day that Joseph Schwartz escaped from his room at the Institute for Nuclear Research. Creen watched Arvardan leave with a bitter half-smile. He took out his little book and studied it closely between puffs at his cigarette. He hadn\u0027t gotten much out of the passengers, despite his story about his uncle (which he had used often before to good effect). To be sure, the old guy had complained about a man living past his time and had blamed it on \"pull\" with the Ancients. That would come under the heading of slander against the Brotherhood. But then the geezer was heading for the Sixty in a month, anyway. No use putting his name down. But this Outsider, that was different. He surveyed the item with a feeling of pleasure: \"Bel Arvardan, Baronn, Sirius Sector-curious about the Sixty-secretive about own affairs-entered Chica by commercial plane 11 A.M. Chica time, 12 October-anti-Terrestrian attitude very marked.\" This time maybe he had a real haul. Picking up these little squealers who made incautious remarks was dull work, but things like this made it payoff. The Brotherhood would have his report before half an hour was up. He made his way leisurely off the field.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-7.html","bookId":1726,"book":{"id":1726,"title":"Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3)","description":"Storyline: Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3) One moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in Chicago, 1949.
