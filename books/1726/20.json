{"id":68640,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"The Secretary passed through the door held open by a soldier. On his purpling, swollen lips there was a brief, cold smile. He bowed to the colonel and remained completely unaware, to all appearances, of the presence of Arvardan. \"Sir,\" said the colonel to the Earthman, \"I have communicated to the High Minister the details of your presence here and the manner in which it came about. Your detention here is, of course, entirely-uh-unorthodox, and it is my purpose to set you free as soon as I can. However, I have here a gentleman who, as you probably know, has lodged against you a very serious accusation; one which, under the circumstances, we must investigate-\" \"I understand, Colonel,\" said the Secretary calmly. \"However, as I have already explained to you, this man has been on Earth, I believe, only a matter of two months or so, so that his knowledge of our internal politics is nonexistent. This is a flimsy basis, indeed, for any accusation.\" Arvardan retorted in anger, \"I am an archaeologist by profession, and one who has specialized of late on Earth and its customs. My knowledge of its politics is far from nonexistent. And in any case, I am not the only one who makes the accusation.\" The Secretary did not look at the archaeologist either now or later. He spoke exclusively to the colonel. He said, \"One of our local scientists is involved in this; one who, approaching the end of his normal sixty years, is suffering from delusions of persecution. Then, in addition, there is another man, one of unknown antecedents and a history of idiocy. All three could not raise a respectable accusation among them.\" Arvardan jumped to his feet. \"I demand to be heard-\" \"Sit down,\" said the colonel coldly and unsympathetically. \"You have refused to discuss the matter with me. Let the refusal stand. Bring in the man with the flag of truce.\" It was another member of the Society of Ancients. Scarcely a flicker of the eyelid betrayed any emotion on his part at the sight of the Secretary. The colonel rose from his chair and said, \"Do you speak for the men outside?\" \"I do, sir.\" \"I assume, then, that this riotous and illegal assembly is based upon a demand for the return of your fellow countryman here?\" \"Yes, sir. He must be immediately freed.\" \"Indeed! Nevertheless, the interest of law and order and the respect due His Imperial Majesty\u0027s representatives on this world require that the matter cannot possibly be discussed while men are gathered in armed rebellion against us. You must have your men disperse.\" The Secretary spoke up pleasantly. \"The colonel is perfectly correct, Brother Cori. Please calm the situation. I am perfectly safe here, and there is no danger-for anybody. Do you understand? For anybody. It is my word as an Ancient.\" \"Very well, Brother. I am thankful you are safe.\" He was ushered out. The colonel said curtly, \"We will see that you leave here safely as soon as matters in the city have returned to normal. Thank you for your co-operation in this matter just concluded.\" Arvardan was again on his feet. \"I forbid it. You will let loose this would-be murderer of the human race while forbidding me an interview with the Procurator when that would be simply in accord with my rights as a Galactic citizen.\" Then, in a paroxysm of frustration, \"Will you show more consideration to an Barthman dog than you will to me?\" The Secretary\u0027s voice sounded over that last near-incoherent rage. \"Colonel, I will gladly remain until such time as my case is heard by the Procurator, if that is what this man wants. An accusation of treason is serious, and the suspicion of it-however farfetched-may be sufficient to ruin my usefulness to my people. I would really appreciate the opportunity to prove to the Procurator that none is more loyal to the Empire than myself.\" The colonel said stiffly, \"I admire your feelings, sir, and freely admit that were I in your place my attitude would be quite different. You are a credit to your race, sir. I will attempt contact with the Procurator.\" Arvardan said nothing more until led back to his cell. He avoided the glance of the others. For a long time he sat motionless, with a knuckle pinched between gnawing teeth. Until Shekt said, \"Well?\" Arvardan shook his head. \"I just about ruined everything.\" \"What did you do?\" \"Lost my temper; offended the colonel; got nowhere-I\u0027m no diplomat, Shekt.\" He felt riven with the sudden urge for self-defense. \"What could I do?\" he cried. \"Balkis had already been to the colonel, so that I couldn\u0027t trust him. What if he\u0027d been offered his life? What if he\u0027s been in on the plot all along? I know it\u0027s a wild thought, but I couldn\u0027t take the chance. It was too suspicious. I wanted to see Ennius himself.\" The physicist was on his feet, withered hands clasped behind his back. \"Well, then-is Ennius coming?\" \"I suppose so. But it is only at Balkis\u0027s own request, and that I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Balkis\u0027s own request? Then Schwartz must be right.\" \"Yes? What has Schwartz been saying?\" The plump Earthman was sitting on his cot. He shrugged his shoulders when the eyes turned to him and spread out his hands in a helpless gesture. \"I caught the Secretary\u0027s Mind Touch when they took him past our room just now. He\u0027s definitely had a long talk with this officer you talked to.\" \"I know.\" \"But there\u0027s no treason in that officer\u0027s mind.\" \"Well,\" miserably, \"then I guessed wrong. I\u0027ll eat worms when Ennius comes. What about Balkis?\" \"There\u0027s no worry or fear in his mind; only hate. And now it\u0027s mostly hate for us, for capturing him, for dragging him here. We\u0027ve wounded his vanity horribly, and he intends to square it with us. I saw little daydream pictures in his mind. Of himself, singlehanded, preventing the entire Galaxy from doing anything to stop him even while we, with our knowledge, work against him. He\u0027s giving us the odds, the trumps, and then he\u0027ll smash us anyway and triumph over us.\" \"You mean that he will risk his plans, his dreams of Empire, just to vent a little spite at us? That\u0027s mad.\" \"I know,\" said Schwartz with finality. \"He is mad.\" \"And he thinks he\u0027ll succeed?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Then we must have you, Schwartz. We\u0027ll need your mind. Listen to me-\" But Shekt was shaking his head. \"No, Arvardan, we couldn\u0027t work that. 1 woke Schwartz when you left and we discussed the matter. His mental powers, which he can describe only dimly, are obviously not under perfect control. He can stun a man, or paralyze him, or even kill him. Better than that, he can control the larger voluntary muscles even against the subject\u0027s will, but no more than that. In the case of the Secretary, he couldn\u0027t make the man talk. the small muscles about the vocal cords being beyond him. He couldn\u0027t co-ordinate motion well enough to have the Secretary drive a car; he even balanced him while walking only with difficulty. Obviously, then, we couldn\u0027t control Ennius, for instance, to the point of having him issue an order, or write one. I\u0027ve thought of that, you see...\" Shekt shook his head as his voice trailed away. Arvardan felt the desolation of futility descend upon him. Then, with a sudden pang of anxiety, \"Where\u0027s Pola?\" \"She\u0027s sleeping in the alcove.\" He would have longed to wake her-longed-Oh, longed a lot of things. Arvardan looked at his watch. It was almost midnight, and there were only thirty hours left. He slept for a while after that, then woke for a while, as it grew light again. No one approached, and a man\u0027s very soul grew haggard and pale. Arvardan looked at his watch. It was almost midnight, and there were only six hours left. He looked about him now in a dazed and hopeless way. They were all here now-even the Procurator, at last. Pola was next to him, her warm little fingers on his wrist and that look of fear and exhaustion on her face that more than anything else infuriated him against all the Galaxy. Maybe they all deserved to die, the stupid, stupid-stupid- He scarcely saw Shekt and Schwartz. They sat on his left. And there was Balkis, the damnable Balkis, with his lips still swollen, one cheek green, so that it must hurt like the devil to talk-and Arvardan\u0027s own lips stretched into a furious, aching smile at the thought and his fists clenched and writhed. His own bandaged cheek ached less at the thought. Facing all of them was Ennius, frowning, uncertain, almost ridiculous, dressed as he was in those heavy, shapeless, leadimpregnated clothes. And he was stupid, too. Arvardan felt a thrill of hatred shoot through him at the thought of these Galactic trimmers who wanted only peace and ease. Where were the conquerors of three centuries back? Where?... Six hours left- Ennius had received the call from the Chica garrison some eighteen hours before and he had streaked half around the planet at the summons. The motives that led him to that were obscure but nonetheless forceful. Essentially, he told himself, there was nothing to the matter but a regrettable kidnaping of one of those green-robed curiosities of superstitious, hagridden Earth. That, and these wild and undocumented accusations. Nothing, certainly, that the colonel on the spot could not have handled. And yet there was Shekt-Shekt was in this-And not as the accused, but as an accuser. It was confusing. He sat now facing them, thinking, quite conscious that his decision in this case might hasten a rebellion, perhaps weaken his own position at court, ruin his chances at advancement-As for Arvardan\u0027s long speech just now about virus strains and unbridled epidemics, how seriously could he take it? After all. if he took action on the basis of it, how credible would the matter sound to his superiors? And yet Arvardan was an archaeologist of note. So he postponed the matter in his mind by saying to the Secretary, \"Surely you have something to say in this matter?\" \"Surprisingly little,\" said the Secretary with easy confidence. \"I would like to ask what evidence exists for supporting the accusation?\" \"Your Excellency,\" said Arvardan with snapping patience, \"I have already told you that the man admitted it in every detail at the time of our imprisonment day before yesterday.\" \"Perhaps,\" said the Secretary, \"you choose to credit that, Your Excellency, but it is simply an additional unsupported statement. Actually the only facts to which outsiders can bear witness to are that I was the one violently taken prisoner, not they; that it was my life that was in peril, not theirs. Now I would like my accuser to explain how he could find all this out in the nine weeks that he has been on the planet, when you, the Procurator, in years of service here, have found nothing to my disadvantage?\" \"There is reason in what the Brother says,\" admitted Ennius heavily. \"How do you know?\" Arvardan replied stiffly, \"Prior to the accused\u0027s confession I was informed of the conspiracy by Dr. Shekt.\" \"Is that so, Dr. Shekt?\" The Procurator\u0027s glance shifted to the physicist. \"That is so, Your Excellency.\" \"And how did you find out?\" Shekt said, \"Dr. Arvardan was admirably thorough and accurate in his description of the use to which the Synapsifier was put and in his remarks concerning the dying statements of the bacteriologist, F. Smitko. This Smitko was a member of the conspiracy. His remarks were recorded and the recording is available.\" \"But, Dr. Shekt, the dying statements of a man known to be in delirium-if what Dr. Arvardan said is true-cannot be of very great weight. You have nothing else?\" Arvardan interrupted by striking his fist on the arm of his chair and roaring, \"Is this a law court? Has someone been guilty of violating a traffic ordinance? We have no time to weigh evidence on an analytical balance or measure it with micrometers. I tell you we have till six in the morning, five and a half hours, in other words, to wipe out this enormous threat...You knew Dr. Shekt previous to this time, Your Excellency. Have you known him to be a liar?\" The Secretary interposed instantly, \"No one accused Dr. Shekt of deliberately lying, Your Excellency. It is only that the good doctor is aging and has, of late, been greatly concerned over his approaching sixtieth birthday. I am afraid that a combination of age and fear have induced slight paranoiac tendencies, common enough here on Earth... Look at him! Does he seem to you quite normal?\" He did not, of course. He was drawn and tense, shattered by what had passed and what was to come. Yet Shekt forced his voice into normal tones, even into calmness. He said, \"I might say that for the last two months I have been under the continual watch of the Ancients; that my letters have been opened and my answers censored. But it is obvious that all such complaints would be attributed to the paranoia spoken of. However, I have here Joseph Schwartz, the man who volunteered as a subject for the Synapsifier one day when you were visiting me at the Institute.\" \"I remember.\" There was a feeble gratitude in Ennius\u0027s mind that the subject had, for the moment, veered. \"Is that the man?\" \"Yes.\" \"He looks none the worse for the experience.\" \"He is far the better. The exposure to the Synapsifier was uncommonly successful, since he had a photographic memory to begin with, a fact I did not know at the time. At any rate, he now has a mind which is sensitive to the thoughts of others.\" Ennius leaned far forward in his chair and cried in a shocked amazement, \"What? Are you telling me he reads minds?\" \"That can be demonstrated, Your Excellency. But I think the Brother will confirm the statement.\" The Secretary darted a quick look of hatred at Schwartz, boiling in its intensity and lightninglike in its passage across his face. He said, with but the most imperceptible quiver in his voice, \"It is quite true, Your Excellency. This man they have here has certain hypnotic faculties, though whether that is due to the Synapsifier or not I don\u0027t know. I might add that this man\u0027s subjection to the Synapsifier was not recorded, a matter which you\u0027ll agree is highly suspicious.\" \"It was not recorded,\" said Shekt quietly, \"in accordance with my standing orders from the High Minister.\" But the Secretary merely shrugged his shoulders at that. Ennius said peremptorily, \"Let us get on with the matter and avoid this petty bickering...What about this Schwartz? What have his mind-reading powers, or hypnotic talents, or whatever they are, to do with the case?\" \"Shekt intends to say,\" put in the Secretary, \"that Schwartz can read my mind.\" \"Is that it? Well, and what is he thinking?\" asked the Procurator, speaking to Schwartz for the first time. \"He\u0027s thinking,\" said Schwartz, \"that we have no way of convincing you of the truth of our side of what you call the case.\" \"Quite true,\" scoffed the Secretary, \"though that deduction scarcely calls for much mental power.\" \"And also,\" Schwartz went on, \"that you are a poor fool, afraid to act, desiring only peace, hoping by your justice and impartiality to win over the men of Earth, and all the more a fool for so hoping.\" The Secretary reddened. \u0027.1 deny all that. It is an obvious attempt to prejudice you, Your Excellency.\" But Ennius said, \"I am not so easily prejudiced.\" And then, to Schwartz, \" And what am 1 thinking?\" Schwartz replied, \"That even if I could see clearly within a man\u0027s skull, I need not necessarily tell the truth about what I see.\" The Procurator\u0027s eyebrows lifted in surprise. \"You are correct, quite correct. Do you maintain the truth of the claims put forward by Drs. Arvardan and Shekt?\" \"Every word of it?\" \"So! Yet unless a second such as you can be found, one who is not involved in the matter, your evidence would not be valid in law even if we could obtain general belief in you as a telepath.\" \"But it is not a question of the law,\" cried Arvardan, \"but of the safety of the Galaxy.\", \"Your Excellency\"-the Secretary rose in his seat-\"I have a request to make. I would like to have this Joseph Schwartz removed from the room.\" \"Why so?\" \"This man, in addition to reading minds, has certain powers of mental force. I was captured by means of a paralysis induced by this Schwartz. It is my fear that he may attempt something of the sort now against me, or even against you, Your Excellency, that forces me to the request.\" Arvardan rose to his feet, but the Secretary overshouted him to say, \"No hearing can be fair if a man is present who might subtly influence the mind of the judge by means of admitted mental gifts.\" Ennius made his decision quickly. An orderly entered, and Joseph Schwartz, offering no resistance, nor showing the slightest sign of perturbation on his moonlike face, was led away. To Arvardan it was the final blow. As for the Secretary, he rose now and for the moment stood there-a squat, grim figure in green; strong in his self-confidence. He began, in serious, formal style, \"Your Excellency, all of Dr. Arvardan\u0027s beliefs and statements rest upon the testimony of Dr. Shekt. In turn, Dr. Shekt\u0027s beliefs rest upon the dying delirium of one man. And all this, Your Excellency, all this, somehow never reached the surface until after Joseph Schwartz was submitted to the Synapsifier. \"Who, then, is Joseph Schwartz? Until Joseph Schwartz appeared on the scene, Dr. Shekt was a normal, untroubled man. You yourself, Your Excellency, spent an afternoon with him the day Schwartz was brought in for treatment. Was he abnormal then? Did he inform you of treason against the Empire? Of certain babblings on the part of a dying biochemist? Did he seem even troubled? Or suspicious? He says now that he was instructed by the High Minister to falsify the results of the Synapsifier tests, not to record the names of those treated. Did he tell you that then? Or only now, after that day on which Schwartz appeared? \"Again, who is Joseph Schwartz? He spoke no known language at the time he was brought in. So much we found out for ourselves later, when we first began to suspect the stability of Dr. Shekt\u0027s reason. He was brought in by a farmer who knew nothing of his identity, or, indeed, any facts about him at all. Nor have any since been discovered. \"Yet this man has strange mental powers. He can stun at a hundred yards by thought alone-kill at closer range. I myself have been paralyzed by him; my arms and legs were manipulated by him; my mind might have been manipulated by him if he had wished. \"I believe, certainly, that Schwartz did manipulate the minds of these others. They say I captured them, that I threatened them with death, that I confessed to treason and to aspiring to Empire-Yet ask of them one question, Your Excellency. Have they not been thoroughly exposed to the influence of Schwartz, that is, of a man capable of controlling their minds? \"Is not perhaps Schwartz a traitor? If not, who is Schwartz?\" The Secretary seated himself, calm, almost genial. Arvardan felt as though his brain had mounted a cyclotron and was spinning outward now in faster and faster revolutions. What answer could one make? That Schwartz was from the past? What evidence was there for that? That the man spoke a genuinely primitive speech? But only he himself-Arvardan-could testify to that. And he, Arvardan, might well have a manipulated mind. After all, how could he tell his mind had not been manipulated? Who was Schwartz? What had so convinced him of this great plan of Galactic conquest? He thought again. From where came his conviction of the truth of the conspiracy? He was an archaeologist, given to doubting, but now-Had it been one man\u0027s word? One girl\u0027s kiss? Or Joseph Schwartz? He couldn\u0027t think! He couldn\u0027t think! \"Well?\" Ennius sounded impatient. \"Have you anything to say, Dr. Shekt? Or you, Dr. Arvardan?\" But Pola\u0027s voice suddenly pierced the silence. \"Why do you ask them? Can\u0027t you see that it\u0027s all a lie? Don\u0027t you see that he\u0027s tying us all up with his false tongue? Oh, we\u0027re all going to die, and I don\u0027t care any more-but we could stop it, we could stop it-And instead we just sit here and-and-talk-\" She burst into wild sobs. The Secretary said, \"So we are reduced to the screams of a hysterical girl...Your Excellency, I have this proposition. My accusers say that all this, the alleged virus and whatever else they have in mind, is scheduled for a definite time-six in the morning, I believe. I offer to remain in your custody for a week. If what they say is true, word of an epidemic in the Galaxy ought to reach Earth within a few days. If such occurs, Imperial forces will still control Earth-\" \"Earth is a fine exchange, indeed, for a Galaxy of humans,\" mumbled the white-faced Shekt. \"I value my own life, and that of my people. We are hostages for our innocence, and I am prepared at this instant to inform the Society of Ancients that I will remain here for a week of my own free will and prevent any disturbances that might otherwise occur.\" He folded his arms. Ennius looked up, his face troubled. \"I find no fault in this man-\" Arvardan could stand it no more. With a quiet and deadly ferocity, he arose and strode quickly toward the Procurator. What he meditated was never known. Afterward he himself could not remember. At any rate, it made no difference. Ennius had a neuronic whip and used it. For the third time since landing on Earth everything about Arvardan flamed up into pain, spun about, and vanished. In the hours during which Arvardan was unconscious the six o\u0027clock deadline was reached-","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-20.html","bookId":1726,"book":{"id":1726,"title":"Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3)","description":"Storyline: Pebble in the Sky (Galactic Empire #3) One moment Joseph Schwartz is a happily retired tailor in Chicago, 1949.
