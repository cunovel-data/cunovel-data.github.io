{"id":45184,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"BY CALDRON POOL\\n\\n One morning early in the year the pair of them were out walking along the shore of Caldron Pool. Caldron Pool is the big pool right under the cliffs at the western end of Narnia. The great waterfall pours down into it with a noise like everlasting thunder, and the River of Narnia flows out on the other side. The waterfall keeps the Pool always dancing and bubbling and churning round and round as if it were on the boil, and that of course is how it got its name of Caldron Pool. It is liveliest in the early spring when the waterfall is swollen with all the snow that has melted off the mountains from up beyond Narnia in the Western Wild from which the river comes. And as they looked at Caldron Pool Shift suddenly pointed with his dark, skinny finger and said,\\n\\n \"Look! What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s what?\" said Puzzle.\\n\\n \"That yellow thing that\u0027s just come down the waterfall. Look! There it is again, it\u0027s floating. We must find out what it is.\"\\n\\n \"Must we?\" said Puzzle.\\n\\n \"Of course we must,\" said Shift. \"It may be something useful. Just hop into the Pool like a good fellow and fish it out. Then we can have a proper look at it.\"\\n\\n \"Hop into the Pool?\" said Puzzle, twitching his long ears.\\n\\n \"Well how are we to get it if you don\u0027t?\" said the Ape.\\n\\n \"But - but,\" said Puzzle, \"wouldn\u0027t it be better if you went in? Because, you see, it\u0027s you who wants to know what it is, and I don\u0027t much. And you\u0027ve got hands, you see. You\u0027re as good as a Man or a Dwarf when it comes to catching hold of things. I\u0027ve only got hoofs.\"\\n\\n \"Really, Puzzle,\" said Shift, \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d ever say a thing like that. I didn\u0027t think it of you, really.\"\\n\\n \"Why, what have I said wrong?\" said the Ass, speaking in rather a humble voice, for he saw that Shift was very deeply offended. \"All I meant was -\"\\n\\n \"Wanting me to go into the water,\" said the Ape. \"As if you didn\u0027t know perfectly well what weak chests Apes always have and how easily they catch cold! Very well. I will go in. I\u0027m feeling cold enough already in this cruel wind. But I\u0027ll go in. I shall probably die. Then you\u0027ll be sorry.\" And Shift\u0027s voice sounded as if he was just going to burst into tears.\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t, please don\u0027t, please don\u0027t,\" said Puzzle, half braying, and half talking. \"I never meant anything of the sort, Shift, really I didn\u0027t. You know how stupid I am and how I can\u0027t think of more than one thing at a time. I\u0027d forgotten about your weak chest. Of course I\u0027ll go in. You mustn\u0027t think of doing it yourself. Promise me you won\u0027t, Shift.\"\\n\\n So Shift promised, and Puzzle went cloppety-clop on his four hoofs round the rocky edge of the Pool to find a place where he could get in. Quite apart from the cold it was no joke getting into that quivering and foaming water, and Puzzle had to stand and shiver for a whole minute before he made up his mind to do it. But then Shift called out from behind him and said: \"Perhaps I\u0027d better do it after all, Puzzle.\" And when Puzzle heard that he said, \"No, no. You promised. I\u0027m in now,\" and in he went.\\n\\n A great mass of foam got him in the face and filled his mouth with water and blinded him. Then he went under altogether for a few seconds, and when he came up again he was in quite another part of the Pool. Then the swirl caught him and carried him round and round and faster and faster till it took him right under the waterfall itself, and the force of the water plunged him down, deep down, so that he thought he would never be able to hold his breath till he came up again. And when he had come up and when at last he got somewhere near the thing he was trying to catch, it sailed away from him till it too got under the fall and was forced down to the bottom. When it came up again it was further from him than ever. But at last, when he was almost tired to death, and bruised all over and numb with cold, he succeeded in gripping the thing with his teeth. And out he came carrying it in front of him and getting his front hoofs tangled up in it, for it was as big as a large hearthrug, and it was very heavy and cold and slimy.\\n\\n He flung it down in front of Shift and stood dripping and shivering and trying to get his breath back. But the Ape never looked at him or asked him how he felt. The Ape was too busy going round and round the Thing and spreading it out and patting it and smelling it. Then a wicked gleam came into his eye and he said:\\n\\n \"It is a lion\u0027s skin.\"\\n\\n \"Ee - auh - auh - oh, is it?\" gasped Puzzle.\\n\\n \"Now I wonder . . . I wonder . . . I wonder,\" said Shift to himself, for he was thinking very hard.\\n\\n \"I wonder who killed the poor lion,\" said Puzzle presently. \"It ought to be buried. We must have a funeral.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it wasn\u0027t a Talking Lion,\" said Shift. \"You needn\u0027t bother about that. There are no Talking Beasts up beyond the Falls, up in the Western Wild. This skin must have belonged to a dumb, wild lion.\"\\n\\n This, by the way, was true. A Hunter, a Man, had killed and skinned this lion somewhere up in the Western Wild several months before. But that doesn\u0027t come into this story.\\n\\n \"All the same, Shift,\" said Puzzle, \"even if the skin only belonged to a dumb, wild lion, oughtn\u0027t we to give it a decent burial? I mean, aren\u0027t all lions rather - well, rather solemn? Because of you know Who. Don\u0027t you see?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you start getting ideas into your head, Puzzle,\" said Shift. \"Because, you know, thinking isn\u0027t your strong point. We\u0027ll make this skin into a fine warm winter coat for you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d like that,\" said the Donkey. \"It would look - I mean, the other Beasts might think - that is to say, I shouldn\u0027t feel -\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" said Shift, scratching himself the wrong way up as Apes do.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it would be respectful to the Great Lion, to Aslan himself, if an ass like me went about dressed up in a lion-skin,\" said Puzzle.\\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t stand arguing, please,\" said Shift. \"What does an ass like you know about things of that sort? You know you\u0027re no good at thinking, Puzzle, so why don\u0027t you let me do your thinking for you? Why don\u0027t you treat me as I treat you? I don\u0027t think I can do everything. I know you\u0027re better at some things than I am. That\u0027s why I let you go into the Pool; I knew you\u0027d do it better than me. But why can\u0027t I have my turn when it comes to something I can do and you can\u0027t? Am I never to be allowed to do anything? Do be fair. Turn and turn about.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well, of course, if you put it that way,\" said Puzzle.\\n\\n \"I tell you what,\" said Shift. \"You\u0027d better take a good brisk trot down river as far as Chippingford and see if they have any oranges or bananas.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m so tired, Shift,\" pleaded Puzzle.\\n\\n \"Yes, but you are very cold and wet,\" said the Ape. \"You want something to warm you up. A brisk trot would be just the thing. Besides, it\u0027s market day at Chippingford today.\" And then of course Puzzle said he would go.\\n\\n As soon as he was alone Shift went shambling along, sometimes on two paws and sometimes on four, till he reached his own tree. Then he swung himself up from branch to branch, chattering and grinning all the time, and went into his little house. He found needle and thread and a big pair of scissors there; for he was a clever Ape and the Dwarfs had taught him how to sew. He put the ball of thread (it was very thick stuff, more like cord than thread) into his mouth so that his cheek bulged out as if he were sucking a big bit of toffee. He held the needle between his lips and took the scissors in his left paw. Then he came down the tree and shambled across to the lion-skin. He squatted down and got to work.\\n\\n He saw at once that the body of the lion-skin would be too long for Puzzle and its neck too short. So he cut a good piece out of the body and used it to make a long collar for Puzzle\u0027s long neck. Then he cut off the head and sewed the collar in between the head and the shoulders. He put threads on both sides of the skin so that it would tie up under Puzzle\u0027s chest and stomach. Every now and then a bird would pass overhead and Shift would stop his work, looking anxiously up. He did not want anyone to see what he was doing. But none of the birds he saw were Talking Birds, so it didn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n Late in the afternoon Puzzle came back. He was not trotting but only plodding patiently along, the way donkeys do.\\n\\n \"There weren\u0027t any oranges,\" he said, \"and there weren\u0027t any bananas. And I\u0027m very tired.\" He lay down.\\n\\n \"Come and try on your beautiful new lion-skin coat,\" said Shift.\\n\\n \"Oh bother that old skin,\" said Puzzle. \"I\u0027ll try it on in the morning. I\u0027m too tired tonight.\"\\n\\n \"You are unkind, Puzzle,\" said Shift. \"If you\u0027re tired what do you think I am? All day long, while you\u0027ve been having a lovely refreshing walk down the valley, I\u0027ve been working hard to make you a coat. My paws are so tired I can hardly hold these scissors. And you won\u0027t say thank you -and you won\u0027t even look at the coat -and you don\u0027t care - and- and-\"\\n\\n \"My dear Shift,\" said Puzzle getting up at once, \"I am so sorry. I\u0027ve been horrid. Of course I\u0027d love to try it on. And it looks simply splendid. Do try it on me at once. Please do.\"\\n\\n \"Well, stand still then,\" said the Ape. The skin was very heavy for him to lift, but in the end, with a lot of pulling and pushing and puffing and blowing, he got it on to the donkey. He tied it underneath Puzzle\u0027s body and he tied the legs to Puzzle\u0027s legs and the tail to Puzzle\u0027s tail. A good deal of Puzzle\u0027s grey nose and face could be seen through the open mouth of the lion\u0027s head. No one who had ever seen a real lion would have been taken in for a moment. But if someone who had never seen a lion looked at Puzzle in his lion-skin he just might mistake him for a lion, if he didn\u0027t come too close, and if the light was not too good, and if Puzzle didn\u0027t let out a bray and didn\u0027t make any noise with his hoofs.\\n\\n \"You look wonderful, wonderful,\" said the Ape. \"If anyone saw you now, they\u0027d think you were Aslan, the Great Lion, himself.\"\\n\\n \"That would be dreadful,\" said Puzzle.\\n\\n \"No it wouldn\u0027t,\" said Shift. \"Everyone would do whatever you told them.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t want to tell them anything.\"\\n\\n \"But you think of the good we could do!\" said Shift. \"You\u0027d have me to advise you, you know. I\u0027d think of sensible orders for you to give. And everyone would have to obey us, even the King himself. We would set everything right in Narnia.\"\\n\\n \"But isn\u0027t everything right already?\" said Puzzle.\\n\\n \"What!\" cried Shift. \"Everything right?-when there are no oranges or bananas?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you know,\" said Puzzle, \"there aren\u0027t many people - in fact, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone but yourself who wants those sort of things.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s sugar too,\" said Shift.\\n\\n \"H\u0027m yes,\" said the Ass. \"It would be nice if there was more sugar.\"\\n\\n \"Well then, that\u0027s settled,\" said the Ape. \"You will pretend to be Aslan, and I\u0027ll tell you what to say.\"\\n\\n \"No, no, no,\" said Puzzle. \"Don\u0027t say such dreadful things. It would be wrong, Shift. I maybe not very clever but I know that much. What would become of us if the real Aslan turned up?\"\\n\\n \"I expect he\u0027d be very pleased,\" said Shift. \"Probably he sent us the lion-skin on purpose, so that we could set things to right. Anyway, he never does turn up, you know. Not nowadays.\"\\n\\n At that moment there came a great thunderclap right overhead and the ground trembled with a small earthquake. Both the animals lost their balance and were flung on their faces.\\n\\n \"There!\" gasped Puzzle, as soon as he had breath to speak. \"It\u0027s a sign, a warning. I knew we were doing something dreadfully wicked. Take this wretched skin off me at once.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/119/5693.html","bookId":447,"book":{"id":447,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：最后一战 The Last Battle","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Last BattleCompleted in March 1953[11] and published 4 September 1956, The Last Battle chronicles the end of the world of Narnia.
