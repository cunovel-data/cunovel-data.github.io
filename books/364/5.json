{"id":29234,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 4 Summoned","content":"Alone in her rooms in the women\u0027s apartments, Moiraine adjusted the shawl, embroidered with curling ivy and grapevines, on her shoulders and studied the effect in the tall frame mirror standing in a corner. Her large, dark eyes could appear as sharp as a hawk\u0027s when she was angry. They seemed to pierce the silvered glass, now. It was only happenstance that she had had the shawl in her saddlebags when she came to Fal Dara. With the blazing white Flame of Tar Valon centered on the wearer\u0027s back and long fringe colored to show her Ajah - Moiraine\u0027s was as blue as a morning sky - the shawls were seldom worn outside Tar Valon, and even there usually only inside the White Tower. Little in Tar Valon besides a meeting of the Hall of the Tower called for the formality of the shawls, and beyond the Shining Walls a sight of the Flame would send too many people running, to hide or perhaps to fetch the Children of the Light. A Whitecloak\u0027s arrow was as fatal to an Aes Sedai as to anyone else, and the Children were too wily to let an Aes Sedai see the bowman before the arrow struck, while she still might do something about it. Moiraine had certainly never expected to wear the shawl in Fal Dara. But for an audience with the Amyrlin, there were proprieties to observe.\\n\\n She was slender and not at all tall, and smooth-cheeked Aes Sedai agelessness often made her appear younger than she was, but Moiraine had a commanding grace and calm presence that could dominate any gathering. A manner ingrained growing up in the Royal Palace of Cairhien had been heightened, not submerged, by still more years as an Aes Sedai. She knew she might need every bit of it today. Yet much of the calm was on the surface, today. There must be trouble, or she would not have come herself, she thought for at least the tenth time. But beyond that lay a thousand questions more. What trouble, and who did she choose to accompany her? Why here? Why now? It cannot be allowed to go wrong now.\\n\\n The Great Serpent ring on her right hand caught the light dully as she touched the delicate golden chain fastened in her dark hair, which hung in waves to her shoulders. A small, clear blue stone dangled from the chain, in the middle of her forehead. Many in the White Tower knew of the tricks she could do using that stone as a focus. It was only a polished bit of blue crystal, just something a young girl had used in her first learning, with no one to guide her. That girl had remembered tales of angreal and even more powerful sa\u0027angreal - those fabled remnants of the Age of Legends that allowed Aes Sedai to channel more of the One Power than any could safely handle unaided-remembered and thought some such focus was required to channel at all. Her sisters in the White Tower knew a few of her tricks, and suspected others, including some that did not exist, some that had shocked her when she learned of them. The things she did with the stone were simple and small, if occasionally useful; the kind a child would imagine. But if the wrong women had - accompanied the Amyrlin, the crystal might put them off balance, because of the tales.\\n\\n A rapid, insistent knocking came at the chamber door. No Shienaran would knock that way, not at anyone\u0027s door, but least of all hers. She remained looking into the mirror until her eyes stared back serenely, all thought hidden in their dark depths. She checked the soft leather pouch hanging at her belt. Whatever troubles brought her out of Tar Valon, she will forget them when I lay this trouble before her. A second thumping, even more vigorous than the first, sounded before she crossed the room and opened the door with a calm smile for the two women who had come for her.\\n\\n She recognized them both. Dark-haired Anaiya in her blue-fringed shawl, and fair-haired Liandrin in her red. Liandrin, not only young-seeming but young and pretty, with a doll\u0027s face and a small, petulant mouth, had her hand raised to pound again. Her dark brows and darker eyes were a sharp contrast to the multitude of pale honey braids brushing her shoulders, but the combination was not uncommon in Tarabon. Both women were taller than Moiraine, though Liandrin by less than a hand.\\n\\n Anaiya\u0027s blunt face broke into a smile as soon as Moiraine opened the door. That smile gave her the only beauty she would ever have, but it was enough; almost everyone felt comforted, safe and special, when Anaiya smiled at them. \"The Light shine on you, Moiraine. It\u0027s good to see you again. Are you well? It has been so long.\"\\n\\n \"My heart is lighter for your presence, Anaiya.\" That was certainly true; it was good to know she had at least one friend among the Aes Sedai who had come to Fal Dara. \"The Light illumine you.\"\\n\\n Liandrin\u0027s mouth tightened, and she gave her shawl a twitch. \"The Amyrlin Seat, she requires your presence, Sister.\" Her voice was petulant, too, and cold-edged. Not for Moiraine\u0027s sake, or not solely; Liandrin always sounded dissatisfied with something. Frowning, she tried to look over Moiraine\u0027s shoulder into the room. \"This chamber, it is warded. We cannot enter. Why do you ward against your sisters?\"\\n\\n \"Against all,\" Moiraine replied smoothly. \"Many of the serving women are curious about Aes Sedai, and I do not want them pawing through my rooms when I am not here. There was no need to make a distinction until now.\" She pulled the door shut behind her, leaving all three of them in the corridor. \"Shall we go? We must not keep the Amyrlin waiting.\"\\n\\n She started down the hallway with Anaiya chatting at her side. Liandrin stood for a moment staring at the door as if wondering what Moiraine was hiding, then hurried to join the others. She bracketed Moiraine, walking as stiffly as a guard. Anaiya merely walked, keeping company. Their slippered footsteps fell softly on thick-woven carpets with simple patterns.\\n\\n Liveried women curtsied deeply as they passed, many more deeply than they would have for the Lord of Fal Dara himself. Aes Sedai, three together, and the Amyrlin Seat herself in the keep; it was more honor than any woman of the keep had ever expected in her lifetime. A few women of noble Houses were out in the halls, and they curtsied, too, which they most certainly would not have done for Lord Agelmar. Moiraine and Anaiya smiled and bowed their heads to acknowledge each reverence, from servant or noble equally. Liandrin ignored them all.\\n\\n There were only women here, of course, no men. No Shienaran male above the age of ten would enter the women\u0027s rooms without permission or invitation, although a few small boys ran and played in the halls here. They knelt on one knee, awkwardly, when their sisters dropped deep curtsies. Now and then Anaiya smiled and ruffled a small head as she passed.\\n\\n \"This time, Moiraine,\" Anaiya said, \"you have been gone from Tar Valon too long. Much too long. Tar Valon misses you. Your sisters miss you. And you are needed in the White Tower.\"\\n\\n \"Some of us must work in the world,\" Moiraine said gently. \"I will leave the Hall of the Tower to you, Anaiya. Yet in Tar Valon, you hear more of what occurs in the world than I. Too often I outrun what happens where I was yesterday. What news have you?\"\\n\\n \"Three more false Dragons.\" Liandrin bit the words off. \"In Saldaea, Murandy, and Tear false Dragons ravage the land. The while, you Blues smile and talk of nothing, and try to hold on to the past.\" Anaiya raised an eyebrow, and Liandrin snapped her mouth shut with a sharp sniff.\\n\\n \"Three,\" Moiraine mused softly. For an instant her eyes gleamed, but she masked it quickly. \"Three in the last two years, and now three more at once. \"\\n\\n \"As the others were, these will be dealt with also. This male vermin and any ragtag rabble who follow their banners.\"\\n\\n Moiraine was almost amused by the certainty in Liandrin\u0027s voice. Almost. She was too aware of the realities, too aware of the possibilities. \"Have a few months been enough for you to forget, Sister? The last false Dragon all but tore Ghealdan apart before his army, ragtag rabble or not, was defeated. Yes, Logain is in Tar Valon by now, gentled and safe, I suppose, but some of our sisters died to overpower him. Even one sister dead is more loss than we can bear, but Ghealdan\u0027s losses were much worse. The two before Logain could not channel, yet even so the people of Kandor and Arad Doman remember them well. Villages burned and men dead in battle. How easily can the world deal with three at one time? How many will flock to their banners? There has never been a shortage of followers for any man claiming to be the Dragon Reborn. How great will the wars be this time?\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t so grim as that,\" Anaiya said. \"As far as we know, only the one in Saldaea can channel. He has not had time to attract many followers, and. sisters should already be there to deal with him. The Tarens are harrying their false Dragon and his followers through Haddon Mirk, while the fellow in Murandy is already in chains.\" She gave a short, wondering laugh. \"To think the Murandians, of all people, would deal with theirs so quickly. Ask, and they do not even call themselves Murandians, but Lugarders, or Inishlinni, or this or that lord\u0027s or lady\u0027s man. Yet for fear one of their neighbors would take the excuse to invade, the Murandians leaped on their false Dragon almost as soon as he opened his mouth to proclaim himself.\"\\n\\n \"Still,\" Moiraine said, \"three at the same time cannot be ignored. Has any sister been able to do a Foretelling?\" It was a slight chance-few Aes Sedai had manifested any part of that Talent, even the smallest part, in centuries-so she was not surprised when Anaiya shook her head. Not surprised, but a little relieved.\\n\\n They reached a juncture of hallways at the same time as the Lady Amalisa. She dropped a full curtsy, bowing deep and spreading her pale green skirts wide. \"Honor to Tar Valon,\" she murmured. \"Honor to Aes Sedai. \"\\n\\n The sister of the Lord of Fal Dara required more than a nod of the head. Moiraine took Amalisa\u0027s hands and drew her to her feet. \"You honor us, Amalisa. Rise, Sister.\"\\n\\n Amalisa straightened gracefully, with a flush on her face. She had never as much as been to Tar Valon, and to be called Sister by an Aes Sedai was heady even for someone of her rank. Short and of middle years, she had a dark, mature beauty, and the color in her cheeks set it off. \"You honor me too greatly, Moiraine Sedai. \"\\n\\n Moiraine smiled. \"How long have we known each other, Amalisa? Must I now call you my Lady Amalisa, as if we had never sat over tea together?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not.\" Amalisa smiled back. The strength evident in her brother\u0027s face was in hers, too, and no less for the softer line of cheek and jaw. There were those who said that as hard and renowned a fighter as Agelmar was, he was no better than an even match for his sister. \"But with the Amyrlin Seat here . . . . When King Easar visits Fal Dara, in private I call him Magami, Little Uncle, as I did when I was a child and he gave me rides on his shoulder, but in public it must be different.\"\\n\\n Anaiya tsked. \"Sometimes formality is necessary, but men often make more of it than they must. Please, call me Anaiya, and I will call you Amalisa, if I may.\"\\n\\n From the corner of her eye, Moiraine saw Egwene, far down the side hall, disappearing hurriedly around a corner. A stooped shape in a leather jerkin, head down and arms loaded with bundles, shambled at her heels. Moiraine permitted herself a small smile, quickly masked. If the girl shows as much initiative in Tar Valon, she thought wryly, she will sit in the Amyrlin Seat one day. If she can learn to control that initiative. If there is an Amyrlin Seat left on which to sit.\\n\\n When she turned her attention back to the others, Liandrin was speaking.\\n\\n \". . . and I would welcome the chance to learn more of your land.\" She wore a smile, open and almost girlish, and her voice was friendly.\\n\\n Moiraine schooled her face to stillness as Amalisa extended an invitation to join her and her ladies in her private garden, and Liandrin accepted warmly. Liandrin made few friends, and none outside the Red Ajah. Certainly never outside the Aes Sedai. She would sooner make friends with a man, or a Trolloc. Moiraine was not sure Liandrin saw much difference between men and Trollocs. She was not sure any of the Red Ajah did.\\n\\n Anaiya explained that just now they must attend the Amyrlin Seat. \"Of course,\" Amalisa said. \"The Light illumine her, and the Creator shelter her. But later, then.\" She stood straight and bowed her head as they left her.\\n\\n Moiraine studied Liandrin as they walked, never looking at her directly. The honey-haired Aes Sedai was staring straight ahead, rosebud lips pursed thoughtfully. She appeared to have forgotten Moiraine and Anaiya both. What is she up to?\\n\\n Anaiya seemed not to have noticed anything out of the ordinary, but then she always managed to accept people both as they were and as they wanted to be. It constantly amazed Moiraine that Anaiya dealt as well as she did in the White Tower, but those who were devious always seemed to take her openness and honesty, her acceptance of everyone, as cunning devices. They were always caught completely off balance when she turned out to mean what she said and say what she meant. Too, she had a way of seeing to the heart of things. And of accepting what she saw. Now she blithely resumed speaking of the news.\\n\\n \"The word from Andor is both good and bad. The street riots in Caemlyn died down with the coming of spring, but there is still talk, too much talk, blaming the Queen, and Tar Valon as well, for the long winter. Morgase holds her throne less securely than she did last year, but she holds it still, and will so long as Gareth Bryne is Captain-General of the Queen\u0027s Guards. And the Lady Elayne, the Daughter-Heir, and her brother, the Lord Gawyn, have come safely to Tar Valon for their training. There was some fear in the White Tower that the custom would be broken.\"\\n\\n \"Not while Morgase has breath in her body,\" Moiraine said.\\n\\n Liandrin gave a little start, as if she had just awakened. \"Pray that she continues to have breath. The Daughter-Heir\u0027s party was followed to the River Erinin by the Children of the Light. To the very bridges to Tar Valon. More still camp outside Caemlyn, for the chance of mischief, and inside Caemlyn still are those who listen.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps it is time Morgase learned a little caution,\" Anaiya sighed. \"The world is becoming more dangerous every day, even for a queen. Perhaps especially for a queen. She was ever headstrong. I remember when she came to Tar Valon as a girl. She did not have the ability to become a full sister, and it rankled in her. Sometimes I think she pushes her daughter because of that, whatever the girl chooses.\"\\n\\n Moiraine sniffed disdainfully. \"Elayne was born with the spark in her; it was not a matter of choosing. Morgase would not risk letting the girl die from lack of training if all the Whitecloaks in Amadicia were camped outside Caemlyn. She would command Gareth Byrne and the Queen\u0027s Guards to cut a path through them to Tar Valon, and Gareth Byrne would do it if he had to do it alone.\" But she still must keep the full extent of the girl\u0027s potential secret. Would the people of Andor knowingly accept Elayne on the Lion Throne after Morgase if they knew? Not just a queen trained in Tar Valon according to custom, but a full Aes Sedai? In all of recorded history there had been only a handful of queens with the right to be called Aes Sedai, and the few who let it be known had all lived to regret it. She felt a touch of sadness. But too much was afoot to spare aid, or even worry, for one land and one throne. \"What else, Anaiya?\"\\n\\n \"You must know that the Great Hunt of the Horn has been called in Illian, the first time in four hundred years. The Illianers say the Last Battle is coming\" - Anaiya gave a little shiver, as well she might, but went on without a pause - \"and the Horn of Valere must be found before the final battle against the Shadow. Men from every land are already gathering, all eager to be part of the legend, eager to find the Horn. Murandy and Altara are on their toes, of course, thinking it\u0027s all a mask for a move against one of them. That is probably why the Murandians caught their false Dragon so quickly. In any case, there will be a new lot of stories for the bards and gleemen to add to the cycle. The Light send it is only new stories.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps not the stories they expect,\" Moiraine said. Liandrin looked at her sharply, and she kept her face still.\\n\\n \"I suppose not,\" Anaiya said placidly. \"The stories they least expect will be exactly the ones they will add to the cycle. Beyond that, I have only rumor to offer. The Sea Folk are agitated, their ships flying from port to port with barely a pause. Sisters from the islands say the Coramoor, their Chosen One, is coming, but they won\u0027t say more. You know how closemouthed the Atha\u0027an Miere are with outsiders about the Coramoor, and in this our sisters seem to think more as Sea Folk than Aes Sedai. The Aiel appear to be stirring, too, but no one knows why. No one ever knows with the Aiel. At least there is no evidence they mean to cross the Spine of the World again, thank the Light.\" She sighed and shook her head. \"What I would not give for even one sister from among the Aiel. Just one. We know too little of them.\"\\n\\n Moiraine laughed. \"Sometimes I think you belong in the Brown Ajah, Anaiya.\"\\n\\n \"Almoth Plain,\" Liandrin said, and looked surprised that she had spoken.\\n\\n \"Now that truly a rumor, Sister,\" Anaiya said. \"A few whispers heard as we were leaving Tar Valon. There may be fighting on Almoth Plain, and perhaps Toman Head, as well. I say, may be. The whispers were faint. Rumors of rumors. We left before we could hear more.\"\\n\\n \"It would have to be Tarabon and Arad Doman,\" Moiraine said, and shook her head. \"They have squabbled over Almoth Plain for nearly three hundred years, but it has never come to open blows.\" She looked at Liandrin; Aes Sedai were supposed to throw off all their old loyalties to lands and rulers, but few did so completely. It was hard not to care for the land of your birth. \"Why would they now - ?\"\\n\\n \"Enough of idle talk,\" the honey-haired woman broke in angrily. \"For you, Moiraine, the Amyrlin waits.\" She took three quick strides ahead of the others and threw open one of a pair of tall doors. \"For you, the Amyrlin will have no idle talk.\"\\n\\n Unconsciously touching the pouch at her waist, Moiraine went past Liandrin through the doorway, with a nod as if the other woman were holding the door for her. She did not even smile at the white flash of anger on Liandrin\u0027s face. What is the wretched girl up to?\\n\\n Brightly colored carpets covered the anteroom floor in layers, and the room was pleasantly furnished with chairs and cushioned benches and small tables, the wood simply worked or just polished. Brocaded curtains sided the tall arrowslits to make them seem more like windows. No fires burned in the fireplaces; the day was warm, and the Shienaran chill would not come until nightfall.\\n\\n Fewer than half a dozen of the Aes Sedai who had accompanied the Amyrlin were there. Verin Mathwin and Serafelle, of the Brown Ajah, did not look up at Moiraine\u0027s entrance. Serafelle was intently reading an old book with a worn, faded leather cover, handling its tattered pages carefully, while plump Verin, sitting cross-legged beneath an arrowslit, held a small blossom up to the light and made notes and sketches in a precise hand in a book balanced on her knee. She had an open inkpot on the floor beside her, and a small pile of flowers on her lap. The Brown sisters concerned themselves with little beside seeking knowledge. Moiraine sometimes wondered if they were really aware of what was going on in the world, or even immediately around them.\\n\\n The three other women already in the room turned, but they made no effort to approach Moiraine, only looked at her. One, a slender woman of the Yellow Ajah, she did not know; she spent too little time in Tar Valon to know all the Aes Sedai, although their numbers were no longer very great. She was acquainted with the two remaining, however. Carlinya was as pale of skin and cold of manner as the white fringe on her shawl, the exact opposite in every way of dark, fiery Alanna Mosvani, of the Green, but they both stood and stared at her without speaking, without expression. Alanna sharply snugged her shawl around her, but Carlinya made no move at all. The slender Yellow sister turned away with an air of regret.\\n\\n \"The Light illumine you all, Sisters,\" Moiraine said. No one answered.\\n\\n She was not sure Serafelle or Verin had even heard. Where are the others? There was no need for them all to be there-most would be resting in their rooms, freshing from the journey-but she was on edge now, all the questions she could not ask running through her head. None of it showed on her face.\\n\\n The inner door opened, and Leane appeared, without her gilt-flamed staff. The Keeper of the Chronicles was as tall as most men, willowy and graceful, still beautiful, with coppery skin and short, dark hair. She wore a blue stole, a hand wide, instead of a shawl, for she sat in the Hall of the Tower, though as Keeper, not to represent her Ajah.\\n\\n \"There you are,\" she said briskly to Moiraine, and gestured to the door behind her. \"Come, Sister. The Amyrlin Seat is waiting.\" She spoke naturally in a clipped, quick way that never changed, whether she was angry or joyful or excited. As Moiraine followed Leane in, she wondered what emotion the Keeper was feeling now. Leane pulled the door to behind them; it banged shut with something of the sound of a cell door closing.\\n\\n The Amyrlin Seat herself sat behind a broad table in the middle of the carpet, and on the table rested a flattened cube of gold, the size of a travel chest and ornately worked with silver. The table was heavily built, its legs stout, but it seemed to squat under a weight two strong men would have had trouble lifting.\\n\\n At the sight of the golden cube Moiraine had difficulty keeping her face unruffled. The last she had seen of it, it had been safely locked in Agelmar\u0027s strongroom. On learning of the Amyrlin Seat\u0027s arrival she had meant to tell her of it herself. That it was already in the Amyrlin\u0027s possession was a trifle, but a worrisome trifle. Events could be outpacing her.\\n\\n She swept a deep curtsy and said formally, \"As you called me, Mother, so have I come.\" The Amyrlin extended her hand, and Moiraine kissed her Great Serpent ring, no different from that of any other Aes Sedai. Rising, she made her tone more conversational, but not too much so. She was aware of the Keeper standing behind her, beside the door. \"I hope you had a pleasant journey, Mother.\"\\n\\n The Amyrlin had been born in Tear, of a simple fisherman\u0027s family, not a noble House, and her name was Siuan Sanche, though very few had used that name, or even thought of it, in the ten years since she had been raised from the Hall of the Tower. She was the Amyrlin Seat; that was the whole of it. The broad stole on her shoulders was striped in the colors of the seven Ajahs; the Amyrlin was of all Ajahs and of none. She was only of medium height, and handsome rather than beautiful, but her face held a strength that had been there before her elevation, the strength of the girl who had survived the streets of the Maule, Tear\u0027s port district, and her clear blue gaze had made kings and queens, and even the Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, drop their eyes. Her own eyes were strained, now, and there was a new tightness to her mouth.\\n\\n \"We called the winds to speed our vessels up the Erinin, Daughter, and even turned the currents to our aid.\" The Amyrlin\u0027s voice was deep, and sad. \"I have seen the flooding we caused in villages along the river, and the Light only knows what we have done to the weather. We will not have endeared ourselves by the damage we\u0027ve done and the crops we may have ruined. All to reach here as quickly as possible.\" Her eyes strayed to the ornate golden cube, and she half lifted a hand as if to touch it, but when she spoke it was to say, \"Elaida is in Tar Valon, Daughter. She came with Elayne and Gawyn.\"\\n\\n Moiraine was conscious of Leane standing to one side, quiet as always in the presence of the Amyrlin. But watching, and listening. \"I am surprised, Mother,\" she said carefully. \"This is no time for Morgase to be without Aes Sedai counsel.\" Morgase was one of the few rulers to openly admit to an Aes Sedai councilor; almost all had one, but few admitted it.\\n\\n \"Elaida insisted, Daughter, and queen or not, I doubt Morgase is a match for Elaida in a contest of wills. In any case, perhaps this time she did not wish to be. Elayne has potential. More than I have ever seen before. Already she shows progress. The Red sisters are swollen up like puff-fish with it. I don\u0027t think the girl leans to their way of thinking, but she is, young, and there is no telling. Even if they don\u0027t manage to bend her, it will make little difference. Elayne could well be the most powerful Aes Sedai in a thousand years, and it is the Red Ajah who found her. They have gained much status in the Hall from the girl.\"\\n\\n \"I have two young women with me in Fal Dara, Mother,\" Moiraine said. \"Both from the Two Rivers, where the blood of Manetheren still runs strong, though they do not even remember there was once a land called Manetheren. The old blood sings, Mother, and it sings loudly in the Two Rivers. Egwene, a village girl, is at least as strong as Elayne. I have seen the Daughter-Heir, and I know. As for the other, Nynaeve was the Wisdom in their village, yet she is little more than a girl herself. It says something of her that the women of her village chose her Wisdom at her age. Once she gains conscious control of what she now does without knowing, she will be as strong as any in Tar Valon. With training, she will shine like a bonfire beside the candles of Elayne and Egwene. And there is no chance these two will choose the Red. They are amused by men, exasperated by them, but they do like them. They will easily counter whatever influence the Red Ajah gains in the White Tower from finding Elayne.\"\\n\\n The Amyrlin nodded as if it were all of no consequence. Moiraine\u0027s eyebrows lifted in surprise before she caught herself and smoothed her features. Those were the two main concerns in the Hall of the Tower, that fewer girls who could be trained to channel the One Power were found every year, or so it seemed, and that fewer of real power were found. Worse than the fear in those who blamed Aes Sedai for the Breaking of the World, worse than the hatred from the Children of the Light, worse even than the workings of Darkfriends, were the sheer dwindling of numbers and the lessening of abilities. The corridors of the White Tower were sparsely populated where once they had been crowded, and what could once be done easily with the One Power could now be done only with difficulty, or not at all.\\n\\n \"Elaida had another reason for coming to Tar Valon, Daughter. She sent the same message by six different pigeons to make sure I received it - and to whom else in Tar Valon she sent pigeons, I can only guess - then came herself. She told the Hall of the Tower that you are meddling with a young man who is ta\u0027veren, and dangerous. He was in Caemlyn, she said, but when she found the inn where he had been staying, she discovered you had spirited him away.\"\\n\\n \"The people at that inn served us well and faithfully, Mother. If she harmed any of them . . . .\" Moiraine could not keep the sharpness out of her voice, and she heard Leane shift. One did not speak to the Amyrlin Seat in that tone; not even a king on his throne did.\\n\\n \"You should know, Daughter,\" the Amyrlin said dryly, \"that Elaida harms no one except those she considers dangerous. Darkfriends, or those poor fool men who try to channel the One Power. Or one who threatens Tar Valon. Everyone else who isn\u0027t Aes Sedai might as well be pieces on a stones board as far as she is concerned. Luckily for him, the innkeeper, one Master Gill as I remember, apparently thinks much of Aes Sedai, and so answered her questions to her satisfaction. Elaida actually spoke well of him. But she spoke more of the young man you took away with you. More dangerous than any man since Artur Hawkwing, she said. She has the Foretelling sometimes, you know, and her words carried weight with the Hall. \"\\n\\n For Leane\u0027s sake, Moiraine made her voice as meek as she could. That was not very meek, but it was the best she could do. \"I have three young men with me, Mother, but none of them is a king, and I doubt very much if any of them even dreams of uniting the world under one ruler. No one has dreamed Artur Hawkwing\u0027s dream since the War of the Hundred Years. \"\\n\\n \"Yes, Daughter. Village youths, so Lord Agelmar tells me. But one of them is ta\u0027veren.\" The Amyrlin\u0027s eyes strayed to the flattened cube again.\\n\\n \"It was put forward in the Hall that you should be sent into retreat for contemplation. This was proposed by one of the Sitters for the Green Ajah, with the other two nodding approval as she spoke.\"\\n\\n Leane made a sound of disgust, or perhaps frustration. She always kept in the background when the Amyrlin Seat spoke, but Moiraine could understand the small interruption this time. The Green Ajah had been allied with the Blue for a thousand years; since Artur Hawkwing\u0027s time, they had all but spoken with one voice. \"I have no desire to hoe vegetables in some remote village, Mother.\" Nor will I, whatever the Hall of the Tower says.\\n\\n \"It was further proposed, also by the Greens, that your care during your retreat should be given to the Red Ajah. The Red Sitters tried to appear surprised, but they looked like fisher-birds who knew the catch was unguarded.\" The Amyrlin sniffed. \"The Reds professed reluctance to take custody of one not of their Ajah, but said they would accede to the wishes of the Hall.\"\\n\\n Despite herself, Moiraine shivered. \"That would be . . . most unpleasant, Mother.\" It would be worse than unpleasant, much worse; the Reds were never gentle. She put the thought of it firmly to one side, to deal with later. \"Mother, I cannot understand this apparent alliance between the Greens and the Reds. Their beliefs, their attitudes toward men, their views of our very purposes as Aes Sedai, are completely opposite. A Red and a Green cannot even talk to each other without coming to shouts.\"\\n\\n \"Things change, Daughter. I am the fifth in a row raised to the Amyrlin Seat from the Blue. Perhaps they feel that is too many, or that the Blue way of thinking no longer suffices in a world full of false Dragons. After a thousand years, many things change.\" The Amyrlin grimaced and spoke as if to herself. \"Old walls weaken, and old barriers fall.\" She shook herself, and her voice firmed. \"There was yet another proposal, one that still smells like week-old fish on the jetty. Since Leane is of the Blue Ajah and I came from the Blue, it was put forward that sending two sisters of the Blue with me on this journey would give the Blue four representatives. Proposed in the Hall, to my face, as if they were discussing repairing the drains. Two of the White Sitters stood against me, and two Green. The Yellow muttered among themselves, then would not speak for or against. One more saying nay, and your sisters Anaiya and Maigan would not be here. There was even some talk, open talk, that I should not leave the White Tower at all.\"\\n\\n Moiraine felt a greater shock than on hearing that the Red Ajah wanted her in their hands. Whatever Ajah she came from, the Keeper of the Chronicles spoke only for the Amyrlin, and the Amyrlin spoke for all Aes Sedai and all Ajahs. That was the way it had always been, and no one had ever suggested otherwise, not in the darkest days of the Trolloc Wars, not when Artur Hawkwing\u0027s armies had penned every surviving Aes Sedai inside Tar Valon. Above all, the Amyrlin Seat was the Amyrlin Seat. Every Aes Sedai was pledged to obey her. No one could question what she did or where she chose to go. This proposal went against three thousand years of custom and law.\\n\\n \"Who would dare, Mother?\"\\n\\n The Amyrlin Seat\u0027s laugh was bitter. \"Almost anyone, Daughter. Riots in Caemlyn. The Great Hunt called without any of us having a hint of it until the proclamation. False Dragons popping up like redbells after a rain. Nations fading, and more nobles playing at the Game of Houses than at any time since Artur Hawkwing cut all their plottings short. And worst of all, every one of us knows the Dark One is stirring again. Show me a sister who does not think the White Tower is losing its grip on events, and if she is not Brown Ajah, she is dead. Time may be growing short for all of us, Daughter. Sometimes I think I can almost feel it growing shorter.\"\\n\\n \"As you say, Mother, things change. But there are still worse perils outside the Shining Walls than within.\"\\n\\n For a long moment the Amyrlin met Moiraine\u0027s gaze, then nodded slowly. \"Leave us, Leane. I would talk to my Daughter Moiraine alone.\"\\n\\n There was only a moment\u0027s hesitation before Leane said, \"As you wish, Mother.\" Moiraine could feel her surprise. The Amyrlin gave few audiences without the Keeper present, especially not to a sister she had reason to chastise.\\n\\n The door opened and closed behind Leane. She would not say a word in the anteroom of what had occurred inside, but the news that Moiraine was alone with the Amyrlin would spread through the Aes Sedai in Fal Dara like wildfire through a dry forest, and the speculation would begin.\\n\\n As soon as the door closed the Amyrlin stood, and Moiraine felt a momentary tingle in her skin as the other woman channeled the One Power. For an instant, the Amyrlin Seat seemed to her to be surrounded by a nimbus of bright light.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that any of the others have your old trick,\" the Amyrlin Seat said, lightly touching the blue stone on Moiraine\u0027s forehead with one finger, \"but most of us have some small tricks remembered from childhood. In any event, no one can hear what we say now.\"\\n\\n Suddenly she threw her arms around Moiraine, a warm hug between old friends; Moiraine hugged back as warmly.\\n\\n \"You are the only one, Moiraine, with whom I can remember who I was. Even Leane always acts as if I had become the stole and the staff, even when we are alone, as if we\u0027d never giggled together as novices. Sometimes I wish we still were novices, you and I. Still innocent enough to see it all as a gleeman\u0027s tale come true, still innocent enough to think we would find men-they would be princes, remember, handsome and strong and gentle? - who could bear to live with women of an Aes Sedai\u0027s power. Still innocent enough to dream of the happy ending to the gleeman\u0027s tale, of living our lives as other women do, just with more than they.\"\\n\\n \"We are Aes Sedai, Siuan. We have our duty. Even if you and I had not been born to channel, would you give it up for a home and a husband, even a prince? I do not believe it. That is a village goodwife\u0027s dream. Not even the Greens go so far.\"\\n\\n The Amyrlin stepped back. \"No, I would not give it up. Most of the time, no. But there have been times I envied that village goodwife. At this moment, I almost do. Moiraine, if anyone, even Leane, discovers what we plan, we will both be stilled. And I can\u0027t say they would be wrong to do it.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/261/363.html","bookId":364,"book":{"id":364,"title":"时光之轮 The Great Hunt","description":"简介： The Great Hunt (abbreviated as tGH by fans) is the second book of The Wheel of Time fantasy series written by American author Robert Jordan.
