{"id":29251,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 21 The Nine Rings","content":"Rand expected the common room to be empty, since it was nearly suppertime, but half a dozen men crowded one table, dicing among their jacks of ale, and another sat by himself over a meal. Though the dicers carried no weapons in sight and wore no armor, only plain coats and breeches of dark blue, something about the way they held themselves told Rand they were soldiers. His eyes went to the solitary man. An officer, with the tops of his high boots turned down, and his sword propped against the table beside his chair. A single slash of red and one of yellow crossed the chest of the officer\u0027s blue coat from shoulder to shoulder, and the front of his head was shaved, though his black hair hung long in the back. The soldiers\u0027 hair was clipped short, as if it all had been cut under the same bowl. All seven turned to look as Rand and the others came in.\n The innkeeper was a lean woman with a long nose and graying hair, but her wrinkles seemed part of her ready smile more than anything else. She came bustling up, wiping her hands on a spotless white apron. \"Good even to you\" - her quick eyes took in Rand\u0027s gold-embroidered red coat, and Selene\u0027s fine white dress - \"my Lord, my Lady. I am Maglin Madwen, my Lord. Be welcome to The Nine Rings. And an Ogier. Not many of your kind come this way, friend Ogier. Would you be up from Stedding Tsofu, then?\"\n Loial managed an awkward half bow under the weight of the chest. \"No, good innkeeper. I come the other way, from the Borderlands.\"\n \"From the Borderlands, you say. Well. And you, my Lord? Forgive me for asking, but you\u0027ve not the look of the Borderlands, if you don\u0027t mind my saying it.\"\n \"I\u0027m from the Two Rivers, Mistress Madwen, in Andor.\" He glanced at Selene - she did not seem to admit he existed; her level look barely admitted that the room existed, or anyone in it. \"The Lady Selene is from Cairhien, from the capital, and I am from Andor.\"\n \"As you say, my Lord.\" Mistress Madwen\u0027s glance flickered to Rand\u0027s sword; the bronze herons were plain on scabbard and hilt. She frowned slightly, but her face was clear again in a blink. \"You\u0027ll be wanting a meal for yourself and your beautiful Lady, and your followers. And rooms, I expect. I\u0027ll have your horses seen to. I\u0027ve a good table for you, right this way, and pork with yellow peppers on the fire. Would you be hunting the Horn of Valere, then, my Lord, you and your Lady?\"\n In the act of following her, Rand almost stumbled. \"No! Why would you think we were?\"\n \"No offense, my Lord. We\u0027ve had two through here already, all polished to look like heroes - not to suggest anything of the kind about you, my Lord-in the last month. Not many strangers come here, except traders up from the capital to buy oats and barley. I\u0027d not suppose the Hunt has left Illian, yet, but maybe some don\u0027t think they really need the blessing, and they\u0027ll get a jump on the others by missing it.\"\n \"We are not hunting the Horn, mistress.\" Rand did not glance at the bundle in Loial\u0027s arms; the blanket with its colorful stripes hung bunched over the Ogier\u0027s thick arms and disguised the chest well. \"We surely are not. We are on our way to the capital.\"\n \"As you say, my Lord. Forgive me for asking, but is your Lady well?\"\n Selene looked at her, and spoke for the first time. \"I am quite well.\" Her voice left a chill in the air that stifled talk for a moment.\n \"You\u0027re not Cairhienin, Mistress Madwen,\" Hurin said suddenly. Burdened down with their saddlebags and Rand\u0027s bundle, he looked like a walking baggage cart. \"Pardon, but you don\u0027t sound it.\"\n Mistress Madwen\u0027s eyebrows rose, and she shot a glance at Rand, then grinned. \"I should have known you\u0027d let your man speak freely, but I\u0027ve grown used to - \" Her glance darted toward the officer, who had gone back to his own meal. \"Light, no, I\u0027m not Cairhienin, but for my sins, I married one. Twenty-three years I lived with him, and when he died on me - the Light shine on him - I was all ready to go back to Lugard, but he had the last laugh, he did. He left me the inn, and his brother the money, when I was sure it would be the other way round. Tricksome and scheming, Barin was, like every man I\u0027ve ever known, Cairhienin most of all. Will you be seated, my Lord? My Lady?\"\n The innkeeper gave a surprised blink when Hurin sat at table with them - an Ogier, it seemed, was one thing, but Hurin was clearly a servant in her eyes. With another quick look at Rand, she bustled off to the kitchens, and soon serving girls came with their meal, giggling and staring at the lord and the lady, and the Ogier, till Mistress Madwen chased them back to their work.\n At first, Rand stared at his food doubtfully. The pork was cut in small bits, mixed with long strips of yellow peppers, and peas, and a number of vegetables and things he did not recognize, all in some sort of clear, thick sauce. It smelled sweet and sharp, both at the same time. Selene only picked at hers, but Loial was eating with a will.\n Hurin grinned at Rand over his fork. \"They spice their food oddly, Cairhienin do, Lord Rand, but for all that, it\u0027s not bad.\"\n \"It won\u0027t bite you, Rand,\" Loial added.\n Rand took a hesitant mouthful, and almost gasped. It tasted just as it smelled, sweet and sharp together, the pork crisp on the outside and tender inside, a dozen different flavors, spices, all blending and contrasting. It tasted like nothing he had ever put in his mouth before. It tasted wonderful. He cleaned his plate, and when Mistress Madwen returned with the serving girls to clear away, he nearly asked for more the way Loial did. Selene\u0027s was still half full, but she motioned curtly for one of the girls to take it.\n \"A pleasure, friend Ogier` The innkeeper smiled. \"It takes a lot to fill up one of you. Catrine, bring another helping, and be quick.\" One of the girls darted away. Mistress Madwen turned her smile on Rand. \"My Lord, I had a man here who played the bittern, but he married a girl off one of the farms, and she has him strumming reins behind a plow, now. I couldn\u0027t help noticing what looks like a flute case sticking out of your man\u0027s bundle. Since my musician\u0027s gone, would you let your man favor us with a little music?\"\n Hurin looked embarrassed.\n \"He doesn\u0027t play,\" Rand explained. \"I do.\"\n The woman blinked. It appeared lords did not play the flute, at least not in Cairhien. \"I withdraw the request, my Lord. Light\u0027s own truth, I meant no offense, I assure you. I\u0027d never ask one such as yourself to be playing in a common room.\"\n Rand hesitated only a moment. It had been too long since he had practiced the flute rather than the sword, and the coins in his pouch would not last forever. Once he was rid of his fancy clothes - once he turned the Horn over to Ingtar and the dagger over to Mat - he would need the flute to earn his supper again while he searched for somewhere safe from Aes Sedai. And safe from myself? Something did happen back there. What?\n \"I don\u0027t mind,\" he said. \"Hurin, hand me the case. Just slide it out.\" There was no need to show a gleeman\u0027s cloak; enough unspoken questions shone in Mistress Madwen\u0027s dark eyes as it was.\n Worked gold chased with silver, the instrument looked the sort a lord might play, if lords anywhere played the flute. The heron branded on his right palm did not interfere with his fingering. Selene\u0027s salves had worked so well he hardly thought of the brand unless he saw it. Yet it was in his thoughts now, and unconsciously he began to play \"Heron on the Wing.\"\n Hurin bobbed his head to the tune, and Loial beat time on the table with a thick finger. Selene looked at Rand as if wondering what he was - I\u0027m not a lord, my Lady. I\u0027m a shepherd, and I play the flute in common rooms - but the soldiers turned from their talk to listen, and the officer closed the wooden cover of the book he had begun reading. Selene\u0027s steady gaze struck a stubborn spark inside Rand. Determinedly he avoided any song that might fit in a palace, or a lord\u0027s manor. He played \"Only One Bucket of Water\" and \"The Old Two Rivers Leaf,\" \"Old Jak\u0027s Up a Tree\" and \"Goodman Priket\u0027s Pipe.\"\n With the last, the six soldiers began to sing in raucous tones, though not the words Rand knew.\n \"We rode down to River Iralell just to see the Taren come.\n We stood along the riverbank with the rising of the sun.\n Their horses blacked the summer plain, their banners blacked the sky.\n But we stood our ground on the banks of River Iralell.\n Oh, we stood our ground. Yes, we stood our ground.\n Stood our ground along the river in the morning.\"\n It was not the first time that Rand had discovered a tune had different words and different names in different lands, sometimes even in villages in the same land. He played along with them until they let the words die away, slapping each other\u0027s shoulders and making rude comments on one another\u0027s singing.\n When Rand lowered the flute, the officer rose and made a sharp gesture. The soldiers fell silent in mid-laugh, scraped back their chairs to bow to the officer with hand on breast - and to Rand - and left without a backwards look.\n The officer came to Rand\u0027s table and bowed, hand to heart; the shaven front of his head looked as if he had dusted it with white powder. \"Grace favor you, my Lord. I trust they did not bother you, singing as they did. They are a common sort, but they meant no insult, I assure you. I am Aldrin Caldevwin, my Lord. Captain in His Majesty\u0027s Service, the Light illumine him.\" His eyes slid over Rand\u0027s sword; Rand had the feeling Caldevwin had noticed the herons as soon as he came in.\n \"They didn\u0027t insult me.\" The officer\u0027s accent reminded him of Moiraine\u0027s, precise and every word pronounced to its full. Did she really let me go? I wonder if she\u0027s following me. Or waiting for me. \"Sit down, Captain. Please.\" Caldevwin drew a chair from another table. \"Tell me, Captain, if you don\u0027t mind. Have you seen any other strangers recently? A lady, short and slender, and a fighting man with blue eyes. He\u0027s tall, and sometimes he wears his sword on his back.\"\n \"I have seen no strangers at all,\" he said, lowering himself stiffly to his seat. \"Saving yourself and your Lady, my Lord. Few of the nobility ever come here.\" His eyes flicked toward Loial with a minute frown; Hurin he ignored for a servant.\n \"It was only a thought.\"\n \"Under the Light, my Lord, I mean no disrespect, but may I hear your name? We have so few strangers here that I find I wish to know every one.\"\n Rand gave it - he claimed no title, but the officer seemed not to notice - and said as he had to the innkeeper, \"From the Two Rivers, in Andor.\"\n \"A wondrous place I have heard, Lord Rand - I may call you so? - and fine men, the Andormen. No Cairhienin has ever worn a blademaster\u0027s sword so young as you. I met some Andormen, once, the Captain-General of the Queen\u0027s Guards among them. I do not remember his name; an embarrassment. Perhaps you could favor me with it?\"\n Rand was conscious of the serving girls in the background, beginning to clean and sweep. Caldevwin seemed only to be making conversation, but there was a probing quality to his look. \"Gareth Bryne.\"\n \"Of course. Young, to hold so much responsibility.\"\n Rand kept his voice level. \"Gareth Bryne has enough gray in his hair to be your father, Captain.\"\n \"Forgive me, my Lord Rand. I meant to say that he came to it young.\" Caldevwin turned to Selene, and for a moment he only stared. He shook himself, finally, as if coming out of a trance. \"Forgive me for looking at you so, my Lady, and forgive me for speaking so, but Grace has surely favored you. Will you give me a name to put to such beauty?\"\n Just as Selene opened her mouth, one of the serving girls let out a cry and dropped a lamp she was taking down from a shelf. Oil splattered, and caught in a pool of flame on the floor. Rand leaped to his feet along with the others at the table, but before any of them could move, Mistress Madwen appeared, and she and the girl smothered the flames with their aprons.\n `\u0027I have told you to be careful, Catrine,\" the innkeeper said, shaking her now-smutty apron under the girl\u0027s nose. \"You\u0027ll be burning the inn down, and yourself in it.\"\n The girl seemed on the point of tears. \"I was being careful, Mistress, but I had such a twinge in my arm.\"\n Mistress Madwen threw up her hands. \"You always have some excuse, and you still break more dishes than all the rest. Ah, it\u0027s all right. Clean it up, and don\u0027t burn yourself.\" The innkeeper turned to Rand and the others, all still standing around the table. \"I hope none of you take this amiss. The girl really won\u0027t burn down the inn. She\u0027s hard on the dishes when she starts mooning over some young fellow, but she\u0027s never mishandled a lamp before.\"\n \"I would like to be shown to my room. I do not feel well after all.\" Selene spoke in careful tones, as though uncertain of her stomach, but despite that she looked and sounded as cool and calm as ever. \"The journey, and the fire.\"\n The innkeeper clucked like a mother hen. \"Of course, my Lady. I have a fine room for you and your Lord. Shall I fetch Mother Caredwain? She has a fine hand with soothing herbs.\"\n Selene\u0027s voice sharpened. \"No. And I wish a room by myself.\"\n Mistress Madwen glanced at Rand, but the next moment she was bowing Selene solicitously toward the stairs. \"As you wish, my Lady. Lidan, fetch the Lady\u0027s things like a good girl, now.\" One of the serving girls ran to take Selene\u0027s saddlebags from Hurin, and the women disappeared upstairs, Selene stiff-backed and silent.\n Caldevwin stared after them until they were gone, then shook himself again. He waited until Rand had seated himself before taking his chair again. \"Forgive me, my Lord Rand, for staring so at your Lady, but Grace has surely favored you in her. I mean no insult.\"\n \"None taken,\" Rand said. He wondered if every man felt the way he did when they looked at Selene. \"As I was riding to the village, Captain, I saw a huge sphere. Crystal, it seemed. What is it?\"\n The Cairhienin\u0027s eyes sharpened. \"It is part of the statue, my Lord Rand,\" he said slowly. His gaze flickered toward Loial; for an instant he seemed to be considering something new.\n \"Statue? I saw a hand, and a face, too. It must be huge.\"\n \"It is, my Lord Rand. And old.\" Caldevwin paused. \"From the Age of Legends, so I am told.\"\n Rand felt a chill. The Age of Legends, when use of the One Power was everywhere, if the stories could be believed. What happened there? I know there was something.\n \"The Age of Legends,\" Loial said. \"Yes, it must be. No one has done work so vast since. A great piece of work to dig that up, Captain.\" Hurin sat silently, as if he not only was not listening, but was not there at all.\n Caldevwin nodded reluctantly. \"I have five hundred laborers in camp beyond the diggings, and even so it will be past summer\u0027s end before we have it clear. They are men from the Foregate. Half my work is to keep them digging, and the other half to keep them out of this village. Foregaters have a fondness for drinking and carousing, you understand, and these people lead quiet lives.\" His tone said his sympathies were all with the villagers.\n Rand nodded. He had no interest in Foregaters, whoever they were. \"What will you do with it?\" The captain hesitated, but Rand only looked back at him until he spoke.\n \"Galldrian himself has ordered that it be taken to the capital.\"\n Loial blinked. \"A very great piece of work, that. I am not sure how something that big could be moved so far.\"\n \"His Majesty has ordered it,\" Caldevwin said sharply. \"It will be set up outside the city, a monument to the greatness of Cairhien and of House Riatin. Ogier are not the only ones who know how to move stone.\" Loial looked abashed, and the captain visibly calmed himself. \"Your pardon, friend Ogier. I spoke in haste, and rudely.\" He still sounded a little gruff. \"Will you be staying in Tremonsien long, my Lord Rand?\"\n \"We leave in the morning,\" Rand said. \"We are going to Cairhien.\"\n \"As it happens, I am sending some of my men back to the city tomorrow. I must rotate them; they grow stale after too long watching men swing picks and shovels. You will not mind if they ride in your company?\" He put it as a question, but as if acceptance were a foregone conclusion. Mistress Madwen appeared on the stairs, and he rose. \"If you will excuse me, my Lord Rand, I must be up early. Until the morning, then. Grace favor you.\" He bowed to Rand, nodded to Loial, and left.\n As the doors closed behind the Cairhienin, the innkeeper came to the table.\n \"I have your Lady settled, my Lord. And I\u0027ve good rooms prepared for you and your man, and you, friend Ogier.\" She paused, studying Rand. \"Forgive me if I overstep myself, my Lord, but I think I can speak freely to a lord who lets his man speak up. If I\u0027m wrong . . . well, I mean no insult. For twenty-three years Barin Madwen and I were arguing when we weren\u0027t kissing, so to speak. That\u0027s by way of saying I have some experience. Right now, you\u0027re thinking your Lady never wants to see you again, but it\u0027s my way of thinking that if you tap on her door tonight, she\u0027ll be taking you in. Smile and say it was your fault, whether it was or not.\"\n Rand cleared his throat and hoped his face was not turning red. Light, Egwene would kill me if she knew I\u0027d even thought of it. And Selene would kill me if I did it. Or would she? That did make his cheeks burn. \"I . . . thank you for your suggestion, Mistress Madwen. The rooms. . . .\" He avoided looking at the blanket-covered chest by Loial\u0027s chair; they did not dare leave it without someone awake and guarding it. \"We three will all sleep in the same room.\"\n The innkeeper looked startled, but she recovered quickly. \"As you wish, my Lord. This way, if you please.\"\n Rand followed her up the stairs. Loial carried the chest under its blanket - the stairs groaned under the weight of him and the chest together, but the innkeeper seemed to think it was just an Ogier\u0027s bulk - and Hurin still carried all the saddlebags and the bundled cloak with the harp and flute.\n Mistress Madwen had a third bed brought in and hastily assembled and made up. One of the beds already there stretched nearly from wall to wall in length, and had obviously been meant for Loial from the start. There was barely room to walk between the beds. As soon as the innkeeper was gone, Rand turned to the others. Loial had pushed the still-covered chest under his bed and was trying the mattress. Hurin was setting out the saddlebags.\n \"Do either of you know why that captain was so suspicious of us? He was, I\u0027m sure of it.\" He shook his head. \"I almost think he thought we might steal that statue, the way he was talking.\"\n \"Daes Dae\u0027mar, Lord Rand,\" Hurin said. \"The Great Game. The Game of Houses, some call it. This Caldevwin thinks you must be doing something to your advantage or you wouldn\u0027t be here. And whatever you\u0027re doing might be to his disadvantage, so he has to be careful.\"\n Rand shook his head. \" \u0027The Great Game\u0027 ? What game?\"\n \"It isn\u0027t a game at all, Rand,\" Loial said from his bed. He had pulled a book from his pocket, but it lay unopened on his chest. \"I don\u0027t know much about it - Ogier don\u0027t do such things - but I have heard of it. The nobles and the noble Houses maneuver for advantage. They do things they think will help them, or hurt an enemy, or both. Usually, it\u0027s all done in secrecy, or if not, they try to make it seem as if they\u0027re doing something other than what they are.\" He gave one tufted ear a puzzled scratch. \"Even knowing what it is, I don\u0027t understand it. Elder Haman always said it would take a greater mind than his to understand the things humans do, and I don\u0027t know many as intelligent as Elder Haman. You humans are odd.\"\n Hurin gave the Ogier a slanted look, but he said, \"He has the right of Daer Dae\u0027mar, Lord Rand. Cairhienin play it more than most, though all southerners do.\"\n \"These soldiers in the morning,\" Rand said. \"Are they part of Caldevwin playing this Great Game? We can\u0027t afford to get mixed in anything like that.\" There was no need to mention the Horn. They were all too aware of its presence.\n Loial shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know, Rand. He\u0027s human, so it could mean anything.\"\n \"Hurin?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, either.\" Hurin sounded as worried as the Ogier looked. \"He could be doing just what he said, or . . . . That\u0027s the way of the Game of Houses. You never know. I spent most of my time in Cairhien in the Foregate, Lord Rand, and I don\u0027t know much about Cairhienin nobles, but-well, Daer Dae\u0027mar can be dangerous anywhere, but especially in Cairhien, I\u0027ve heard.\" He brightened suddenly. \"The Lady Selene, Lord Rand. She\u0027ll know better than me or the Builder. You can ask her in the morning.\"\n But in the morning, Selene was gone. When Rand went down to the common room, Mistress Madwen handed him a sealed parchment. \"If you\u0027ll forgive me, my Lord, you should have listened to me. You should have tapped on your Lady\u0027s door.\"\n Rand waited until she went away before he broke the white wax seal. The wax had been impressed with a crescent moon and stars.\n I must leave you for a time. There are too many people here, and I do not like Caldevwin. I will await you in Cairhien. Never think that I am too far from you. You will be in my thoughts always, as I know that I am in yours.\n It was not signed, but that elegant, flowing script had the look of Selene.\n He folded it carefully and put it in his pocket before going outside, where Hurin had the horses waiting.\n Captain Caldevwin was there, too, with another, younger officer and fifty mounted soldiers crowding the street. The two officers were bare-headed, but wore steel-backed gauntlets, and gold-worked, breastplates strapped over their blue coats. A short staff was fastened to the harness on each officer\u0027s back, bearing a small, stiff blue banner above his head. Caldevwin\u0027s banner bore a single white star, while the younger man\u0027s was crossed by two white bars. They were a sharp contrast to the soldiers in their plain armor and helmets that looked like bells with metal cut away to expose their faces.\n Caldevwin bowed as Rand came out of the inn. \"Good morning to you, my Lord Rand. This is Elricain Tavolin, who will command your escort, if I may call it that.\" The other officer bowed; his head was shaved as Caldevwin\u0027s was. He did not speak.\n \"An escort will be welcome, Captain,\" Rand said, managing to sound at ease. Fain would not try anything against fifty soldiers, but Rand wished he could be certain they were only an escort.\n The captain eyed Loial, on his way to his horse with the blanket-covered chest. \"A heavy burden, Ogier.\"\n Loial almost missed a step. \"I never like to be far from my books, Captain.\" His wide mouth flashed teeth in a self-conscious grin, and he hurried to strap the chest onto his saddle.\n Caldevwin looked around, frowning. \"Your Lady is not down yet. And her fine animal is not here.\"\n \"She left already,\" Rand told him. \"She had to go on to Cairhien quickly, during the night.\"\n Caldevwin\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"During the night? But my men . . . . Forgive me, my Lord Rand.\" He drew the younger officer aside, whispering furiously.\n \"He had the inn watched, Lord Rand,\" Hurin whispered. \"The Lady Selene must have gotten past them unseen somehow.\"\n Rand climbed to Red\u0027s saddle with a grimace. If there had been any chance Caldevwin did not suspect them of something, it seemed Selene had finished it. \"Too many people, she says,\" he muttered. \"There\u0027ll be more people by far in Cairhien.\"\n \"You said something, my Lord?\"\n Rand looked up as Tavolin joined him, mounted on a tall, dust-colored gelding. Hurin was in his saddle, too, and Loial stood beside his big horse\u0027s head. The soldiers were formed up in ranks. Caldevwin was nowhere :o be seen.\n \"Nothing is happening the way I expect,\" Rand said.\n Tavolin gave him a brief smile, hardly more than a twitch of his lips. \u0027Shall we ride, my Lord?\"\n The strange procession headed for the hard-packed road that led to the city of Cairhien.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/261/380.html","bookId":364,"book":{"id":364,"title":"时光之轮 The Great Hunt","description":"简介： The Great Hunt (abbreviated as tGH by fans) is the second book of The Wheel of Time fantasy series written by American author Robert Jordan.
