And men proclaimed themselves for the Dragon, and other men struck them down and were struck down in turn.\\n\\n Other tales spread, of a column that rode from the sinking sun across Almoth Plain. A hundred Bordermen, it was said. No, a thousand. No, a thousand heroes come back from the grave to answer the call of the Horn of Valere. Ten thousand. They had destroyed a legion of the Children of the Light entire. They had thrown Artur Hawkwing\u0027s returned armies back into the sea. They were Artur Hawkwing\u0027s armies returned. Toward the mountains they rode, toward the dawn.\\n\\n Yet one thing every tale had the same. At their head rode a man whose face had been seen in the sky above Falme, and they rode under the banner of the Dragon Reborn.\\n\\n And men cried out to the Creator, praying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One be born of the mountain, according to the Prophecies, as he was in Ages past and will be in Ages to come. Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs. Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the Dark, and the great sword of justice defend us. Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.\\n\\n -from Choral, Drianaan to Calaanon, The Cycle of the Dragon,\\n\\n Author unknown, the Fourth Age\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/261/409.html","bookId":364,"book":{"id":364,"title":"时光之轮 The Great Hunt","description":"简介： The Great Hunt (abbreviated as tGH by fans) is the second book of The Wheel of Time fantasy series written by American author Robert Jordan.
