{"id":21773,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. A SURPRISE ON THE ROAD.","content":"When Nelson struck the water he was all of fifty feet away from the sloop. Down he went over his head, but quickly reappeared and struck out boldly. \"Hullo, somebody\u0027s overboard from the ship!\" cried a young man, who sat at the bow of the sloop. \"Port your helm, Bob, or you\u0027ll run into him!\" The helm was thrown over, and the sloop veered around. Then Nelson set up a shout. \"Help! Pick me up!\" he cried. \"On board the sloop! Help!\" \"We\u0027ll pick you up, don\u0027t fear!\" cried the young fellow at the bow, and the sloop came around and the mainsail was lowered. The two young men on the craft were skillful sailors, and soon came within reach of Nelson. One held out a boathook, and presently our hero was hauled on board. \"It\u0027s a lucky thing we were near by, or you[Pg 225] might have been drowned,\" said the young man called Bob. \"Isn\u0027t that so, Clarence?\" \"That\u0027s true,\" answered Clarence Bell. \"I see your ship isn\u0027t stopping for you.\" \"She isn\u0027t my ship, and I don\u0027t want her to stop,\" answered Nelson, shaking the water from him. \"Oh! Then you jumped overboard on purpose.\" \"I did, and I am thankful you picked me up. The captain who runs that boat was going to carry me to the West Indies against my will.\" \"Great C?sar! Bob, do you hear that?\" \"I do,\" returned Bob Chalmer. \"Was it a case of kidnaping?\" \"Hardly that,\" replied Nelson. \"I\u0027ll tell you the whole story, if you\u0027d like to hear it. Only I want to be sure that that boat doesn\u0027t put back after me,\" he continued. He watched the Victory for fully five minutes but nothing was done toward turning back, and at last he gave a great sigh of relief. \"I guess I\u0027m safe,\" he remarked. \"You are, lad. But you had better take off those wet clothes, or you\u0027ll take cold. You\u0027ll find a dry suit in the cuddy.\" This was sensible advice, and Nelson followed it. As soon as he had donned the other suit he[Pg 226] sat down and told how he had chased Billy Darnley on board the Victory, and of what had followed. \"Humph! that captain is pretty hard-hearted,\" remarked Clarence Bell. \"He ought to be arrested,\" put in Bob Chalmer. \"You were lucky to get away. I guess that thief is out of your reach now.\" \"Well, anyway, I left him as sick as he could be,\" said Nelson, and could not help but laugh over Darnley\u0027s woe-begone appearance. \"He\u0027ll have enough of the sea by the time he gets back.\" From the young men he learned that they had been out for two days on a fishing trip. They had had good luck, as the mess on board proved, and they were now sailing for Manasquan Inlet, where they were boarding for a few weeks. \"We belong in New York,\" said Bob Chalmer later. \"And I guess we can see you through all right.\" \"I\u0027ll be much obliged, if you would,\" said Nelson. \"I\u0027ll pay you back as soon as I reach the city.\" And then he told of the news stand, and the business he and Van Pelt were doing. The breeze was as brisk as ever, and it veered around, so that the sloop made the Inlet [Pg 227]without difficulty. They ran up the river to a small collection of cottages and boathouses known as Reefer\u0027s. Here they tied up, and Nelson went ashore, wearing the old fishing suit he had borrowed. \"You can\u0027t get home to-night, so you shall stay with us,\" said Bob Chalmer, and procured a room at one of the cottages for Nelson. Tired out, our hero slept well. But he arose early, and by that time his own clothes were dry, and he put them on. \"I\u0027ve got a railroad ticket in my pocket good from Lakewood to New York,\" said Chalmer, while they were having breakfast. \"It\u0027s a limited ticket and runs out to-morrow. Why can\u0027t you use that? You can have it at half price.\" \"How far is Lakewood from here?\" \"Not over six or seven miles. The stage will take you over for fifteen cents.\" \"That will suit me,\" answered our hero. \"I\u0027ve got half a dollar left.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll lend you some money, Nelson!\" \"No; I won\u0027t need it.\" The matter was talked over, and our hero took the ticket. Quarter of an hour later he was on the stage, bound for Lakewood. It was a clear day, and the ride among the smooth roads was thoroughly enjoyable. Yet[Pg 228] Nelson thought but little of the journey. His mind was filled with his personal affairs. He wondered what Van Pelt thought of his continued disappearance. \"He\u0027ll think I\u0027ve captured Darnley sure,\" he reasoned. \"Well, what\u0027s happened can\u0027t be helped, and I\u0027m lucky to escape, I suppose.\" On and on went the stage, making good time, for the team was fresh. When about two miles from Lakewood they reached a bend, where the road was being repaired. A steam roller was at work, and at this one of the horses grew frightened and started to run away. His mate went with him, and in a twinkle the stage was bumping along at a high rate of speed. \"Stop! stop!\" shrieked a lady sitting near Nelson. \"Stop, or we\u0027ll all be killed!\" \"Whoa! whoa!\" roared the stage-driver, and tried to pull the horses in. But his lines were old, and suddenly one snapped, and then the horses went along faster than ever. Not far down the road were several heaps of stone, to be used in repairing the highway, and the team headed directly for the first of these heaps. The driver tried to sheer them around, but with one line gone was nearly helpless, and[Pg 229] in a second more the stage struck the pile and went over with a crash. Then the horses came to a halt. No one was seriously injured by the mishap, although the lady who had cried out was much shaken up. Soon all gathered around, to learn the extent of the damage to the stage. It was found that one of the front wheels was knocked to pieces. The driver was much downcast, and knew not what to do. \"I\u0027ll have to leave the turnout here and go back to Berry\u0027s shop for a new wheel, I suppose,\" he said. He could not state how soon he would return, or how soon the stage would be ready to start forward once more. \"How far is it to the Lakewood railroad station from here?\" questioned Nelson. \"Not over a mile and a half.\" \"Then I\u0027ll walk it, if you\u0027ll show me the shortest road.\" \"The shortest road is that over yonder,\" answered the stage-driver. \"It aint no good for driving, but it\u0027s plenty good enough for hoofing it.\" \"Thanks,\" said Nelson, and without waiting he started off to walk the remainder of the journey. He had still an hour and a half before the[Pg 230] train would be due at Lakewood, so he took his time and often stopped to look at the dense woods and the beautiful green fields. \"What a difference between this and New York streets!\" he said to himself. \"And how quiet it is! I don\u0027t believe I could sleep here at night, it would be so still!\" At length he came within sight of an old cottage, where a woman was hanging up a small wash on a line. Feeling thirsty, he resolved to go into the yard and ask her for a drink of water. But no sooner had he set foot in the weedy garden than the woman came running toward him, waving him away. \"Don\u0027t want to buy anything!\" she cried shrilly. \"Don\u0027t want to buy! Go away!\" \"I haven\u0027t anything to sell,\" answered Nelson, with a smile. \"I was going to ask for a drink of water.\" \"Oh!\" The woman eyed him suspiciously. \"Water, did you say?\" \"Yes; I\u0027d like a drink.\" \"The well is mighty poor here. You can get a drink up to the next house.\" \"Very well,\" returned Nelson, and started to leave the garden. As he did so he heard a sudden crash of glass and, looking up, saw some[Pg 231] panes from a window in an upper room of the cottage fall to the ground. \"Nelson! Nelson! Help me!\" came the unexpected cry. \"My gracious!\" burst out our hero, in bewilderment. \"Gertrude! What does this mean?\" \"I am held a prisoner,\" answered Gertrude. \"Save me!\" \"A prisoner?\" \"Yes, Nelson. You will help me, won\u0027t you?\" \"To be sure I\u0027ll help you. But—but who did this?\" \"My cousin, Mr. Bulson.\" \"The scoundrel! Is he here now?\" \"I think not. But he may come back at any moment.\" \"Go away from here!\" shrieked Sarah Higgins, in alarm. \"Go away! That girl is crazy!\" \"I guess you are crazy!\" returned Nelson hotly. \"Stand aside and let me get into the house.\" \"No, no! You must go away!\" went on Sarah Higgins. Then of a sudden she leaped back and ran for the cottage with might and main. Reaching it,[Pg 232] she closed the door and locked it. Then she appeared at a near-by window, armed with a rolling-pin. \"Don\u0027t you dast come in!\" she shrieked. \"If you do, you\u0027ll have to take the consequences!\" And she flourished the rolling-pin defiantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2991/82514.html","bookId":321,"book":{"id":321,"title":"Nelson The Newsboy Or, Afloat in New York","description":"简介： Nelson the Newsboy relates the adventures of a wide-awake lad in the great metropolis.
