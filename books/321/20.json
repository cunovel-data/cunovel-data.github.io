{"id":21763,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. NELSON TO THE RESCUE.","content":"On the same evening that Gertrude visited Sam Pepper\u0027s establishment, Nelson, after closing up, determined to run down and call upon the girl and tell her about the stand and how well they had done that day. \"She\u0027ll be pleased, I know,\" he told himself. \"She wants me to make a man of myself.\" Arriving at the tenement house, he ascended the stairs to Mrs. Kennedy\u0027s rooms and knocked upon the back door. To his surprise Gladys Summers, the flower girl, let him in. \"Hullo, Gladys! you here?\" he said. \"Oh, Nelson! I thought it was Gertrude,\" answered the flower girl. \"Did you bring her along?\" \"Along? I haven\u0027t seen her.\" \"She went over to Sam Pepper\u0027s place to bring you here. Mrs. Kennedy is very sick, and we didn\u0027t know what to do.\" \"I haven\u0027t been to Sam\u0027s place. I left there[Pg 148] yesterday for good. What\u0027s the matter with the old lady?\" \"Her rheumatism has got up around her heart, and she\u0027s very bad. I think she ought to have a doctor.\" \"She shall have one, Gladys. Was Gertrude going to get one?\" \"No, she was going to get you to do that. She doesn\u0027t know anything of doctors down here, so she said.\" \"I\u0027ll have one here in a little while,\" said our hero, and ran down the stairs, two steps at a time. Two blocks below the house there was a drug store, and a doctor had his office upstairs. The physician was in, and listened to what Nelson had to say. \"I\u0027ll go,\" he said. \"But you know my terms to strangers.\" \"How much will the visit be?\" \"A dollar.\" \"There\u0027s your money.\" And our hero handed it over. The pair were soon at Mrs. Kennedy\u0027s bedside, and after an examination the doctor wrote out a prescription and Nelson had it filled at the drug store. The physician said he would call again the following afternoon. \"She\u0027s in a bad state,\" he said. \"She has[Pg 149] likely had this rheumatism for years, and her age is against her.\" \"Don\u0027t you think she\u0027ll get over it?\" asked our hero. \"I think she will. But she may be helpless for many weeks.\" \"It\u0027s hard luck. She hasn\u0027t any money.\" \"Then you had better send her to the hospital.\" \"No, she shall stay home, if she wants to,\" said Nelson. \"I guess I and the rest can take care of her. She was always good to me and the others.\" After the medicine had been administered and Mrs. Kennedy was a trifle easier, Nelson began to grow impatient that Gertrude had not yet returned. \"I guess I\u0027ll go out and hunt her up,\" he said to Gladys Summers. \"Will you stay here?\" \"Yes; I promised to stay all night, Nelson.\" Our hero was soon in the street again and making his way rapidly over to the East Side in the direction of Sam Pepper\u0027s resort. It was now late, but this part of the city was still bustling with life. Yet to our hero\u0027s surprise, when he reached Pepper\u0027s place he found it locked up. \"Closed!\" he muttered. \"This is queer. I wonder where Gertrude went?\" He stood for a moment on the pavement, then went and rapped loudly on the glass of the door. [Pg 150] For a minute there was no response, then, as he rapped again, Sam Pepper appeared. His face fell when he lifted a door shade and saw our hero. \"What do you want now?\" he growled, as he opened the door for a space of several inches. \"Was that young lady over here to find me?\" asked our hero. \"Nobody here to see you,\" answered Sam Pepper gruffly. \"She wasn\u0027t? Why, she started for here.\" \"I haven\u0027t seen anybody. Is that all you want?\" \"Yes. Why are you shut up so early?\" \"I didn\u0027t feel very well and thought I\u0027d go to bed and sleep it off,\" answered Pepper smoothly. \"I\u0027m going back again. Good-night!\" \"Then you haven\u0027t seen her at all?\" persisted the newsboy. \"Haven\u0027t I told you so before? Now, don\u0027t disturb me again.\" And with this Sam Pepper slammed the door shut and locked it. Nelson was nonplused, not so much by what Pepper had said as by the man\u0027s manner. \"He wanted to get rid of me in a hurry,\" he mused. \"Somehow, this affair doesn\u0027t look right to me.\" While our hero was standing near the curb, speculating upon where next to look for Gertrude,[Pg 151] he was surprised to see Paul Randall come down the street. \"Why, Paul, how is it you are out so late?\" he asked. \"Got stuck on some sporting extras and was bound to sell \u0027em,\" answered Paul. \"Say, I hear you\u0027ve bought out a stand.\" \"George Van Pelt and I have bought out a stand.\" \"Hope you make lots of money. If you need a clerk, don\u0027t forget me.\" \"I won\u0027t forget you, Paul. We have a boy now who delivers papers for us. He talks of leaving. If he does, I\u0027ll let you know. But, I say, have you been around here long?\" \"Most all the evening.\" \"You know that young lady who is stopping with Mrs. Kennedy, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes. Gladys Summers calls her \u0027the angel,\u0027\" answered Paul readily. \"She\u0027s a real lady, aint she, Nelson?\" \"She is.\" \"I saw her go into Pepper\u0027s an hour or two ago.\" \"You did! I was going to ask you if you had seen her. You haven\u0027t made any mistake?\" \"Not much! I\u0027d know her in a whole city full—she\u0027s so sweet and beautiful.\" [Pg 152] \"Did you see her come away?\" \"No.\" \"Were you around so you could have seen her?\" \"Yes; and I kept my eye on the door for almost an hour. I thought you might be with her.\" \"No; Sam Pepper and I have parted for good, Paul. I\u0027ve got a room uptown, near the stand. I\u0027d like to know what became of the young lady.\" \"If she came out, it must have been after I went away.\" Paul knew that his mother, who was now getting better, would be anxious about him, so, without waiting longer, he hurried on. Nelson remained on the sidewalk, in deep thought. Presently, as he was looking toward Sam Pepper\u0027s resort, he saw a corner of a curtain lifted and saw the man peer out at him. Then the curtain was dropped again. \"He\u0027s watching me,\" thought the newsboy. \"Something is wrong here, and I know it. He and that Homer Bulson are friends, and Bulson is bound to make Miss Gertrude marry him. Perhaps they have hatched up some game against Miss Gertrude.\" Not to make Sam Pepper more suspicious, Nelson walked briskly away, up the street. But at the first corner he turned, sped down the side[Pg 153] street, and then into the alleyway connecting with the rear of Pepper\u0027s resort. It took him but a minute to ascertain that the shutters to the rear room were tightly closed, and held together by a wire bound from one catch to the other. The shutters were solid, but near the tops were several round holes, put there for ventilating purposes. Looking around our hero discovered an empty barrel, and standing on this he managed to look through one of the holes into the apartment. He saw Gertrude sitting on a chair, the picture of misery. The hot tears were flowing down her cheeks. The sight went straight to his heart, and without waiting to think of results, he leaped from the barrel, pulled away the wire, and flung the shutters open. Then he lifted the window, which had been pulled down, but not fastened. Gertrude heard the noise and leaped up in fresh alarm. But when she saw our hero she gave a cry of joy. \"Oh, Nelson! will you help me?\" she gasped. \"Certainly I\u0027ll help you, Miss Gertrude,\" he answered. \"What are they doing—keeping you a prisoner here?\" \"Something like that. Mr. Bulson was here[Pg 154] and went out to get a coach, so that he could take me away. Mr. Pepper is on guard in his saloon.\" \"Just come with me, and you\u0027ll be safe.\" Gertrude came to the window, and Nelson helped her into the alleyway. Just as she leaped from the window Sam Pepper unlocked the door and opened it. \"Stop!\" roared the man. \"Stop, I say!\" \"Don\u0027t stop!\" said Nelson, and caught Gertrude by the hand. Dark as it was, the boy knew the narrow and dirty thoroughfare well, and soon led his companion to the street beyond. Pepper came as far as the window, and called after them once more, but did not dare to follow further. STOP! ROARED THE MAN.
