{"id":21760,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. NELSON AND PEPPER PART.","content":"Nelson remained on watch, and as soon as he saw George Van Pelt coming he headed him off and took him around the corner. \"I\u0027ve bought the stand,\" he said. \"Already?\" \"Yes. I had a talk with old Maxwell, offered him eighty cash, and he took me up. So we\u0027ve saved ten dollars.\" \"He\u0027ll be mad when he learns he might have had ninety.\" \"He needn\u0027t know. Give me your money, and I\u0027ll pay him the balance.\" So it was arranged, and Nelson went to the stand and closed the deal. Old Maxwell had taken in thirty-two cents, and this was passed over to the boy. \"Going to run the stand alone?\" queried the old man. \"No, a man is going to help me,\" said our hero. \"Who is it?\" \"George Van Pelt.\" [Pg 128] \"Oh, that\u0027s it, is it?\" exclaimed old Maxwell. \"I thought he wanted the stand himself.\" \"He couldn\u0027t raise the money. Here he comes now.\" Nelson beckoned to Van Pelt, and soon both were hard at work cleaning up the stand. They talked the matter over and agreed to give old Maxwell a dollar more, if he would come around for two mornings and explain whatever proved strange to them. \"Sure, I\u0027ll do it,\" said Maxwell. \"I want you to get the best of the man up on the elevated station and the man on the next block. They are both mean fellows and don\u0027t deserve any trade.\" \"We intend to hustle and get all the trade we can,\" said our hero. It must be confessed that he felt very proud of his situation. He was no longer a mere newsboy, but a business man, and he felt, somehow, as if he had grown several inches taller. \"We must have a sign,\" said Van Pelt. \"What will we make it—Van Pelt \u0026 Pepper, Newsdealers?\" \"I don\u0027t like the name Pepper—for a last name, I mean,\" said our hero, scratching his curly head. \"Better make it Van Pelt \u0026 Company, for the present.\" And the next day an oilcloth sign was tacked up proclaiming the new firm, and notifying[Pg 129] all that they dealt in newspapers, magazines, books, and school supplies. While Nelson tended the stand George Van Pelt went downtown to a jobbing house and bought some extra stock. In a few days business was in full blast and prospects looked very bright. \"I am glad to see you doing well,\" said Gertrude, on visiting the stand one Saturday, after giving her music lessons. \"It looks quite like a place of business. It won\u0027t be long before you\u0027ll have a store.\" \"We\u0027ll have to save up for it,\" answered our hero. He wanted the girl to stay a little while, but she could not, for Mrs. Kennedy was down with rheumatism and was next to helpless. \"She has been very kind to me and I wish to do what I can for her,\" said Gertrude. \"Is her stand closed?\" \"No, Gladys Summers is running it for her. She has put her flowers in with the other stock.\" \"Gladys is good-hearted, too,\" was Nelson\u0027s comment. Sam Pepper heard of the newsboy\u0027s new move two days after the stand was bought. \"Going into business with George Van Pelt, eh?\" he observed, when Nelson came home that night. [Pg 130] \"Yes.\" \"He\u0027s a poor sort. He\u0027ll never get rich. He\u0027s not slick enough.\" \"I\u0027m satisfied with him,\" returned the newsboy briefly. \"What did you take in to-day?\" \"A little over nine dollars.\" \"Phew! that\u0027s better than I thought. How much profit?\" \"About three dollars and a half above expenses.\" \"And you git half?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then you ought to pay me more board money.\" \"I\u0027m paying all it\u0027s worth now. I get no more meals, remember—I only use this place to sleep in.\" \"Well, that\u0027s worth more.\" \"I\u0027m thinking of getting a room near the stand,\" went on Nelson, after a pause. \"What! you want to leave me!\" roared Sam Pepper. \"Why not? There is nothing to keep me here. I don\u0027t want anything to do with your saloon.\" \"That\u0027s a nice way to talk to me.\" \"I can\u0027t help it. I hate the saloon, and it\u0027s too[Pg 131] far to come down here just to sleep; especially when I have to leave so early in the morning.\" \"Supposing I don\u0027t let you leave?\" To this Nelson made no reply. \"You\u0027re a nice son, I must say,\" went on Sam Pepper. \"This is what I git for raising you.\" \"I am not your son, Sam Pepper. As for what you\u0027ve done for me, I\u0027m willing to pay you for that. You let me leave without any fuss and I\u0027ll give you two dollars a week until the debt is paid.\" \"Two dollars a week aint much.\" \"It\u0027s all I can afford, with my other expenses.\" \"Reckon you don\u0027t care much for me, any more.\" \"I never did care for you, and you know it. I don\u0027t like drinking people and the other kind that hang around here. I want to become respectable and make something of myself.\" \"Aint I respectable?\" roared Pepper, raising his fist in anger. \"Say that again, and I\u0027ll knock you down.\" \"I said that I didn\u0027t like the crowd that hangs around here. I\u0027m going to get out, whether you take up my offer or not.\" \"Then clear out—and the sooner the better. It\u0027s a pity I didn\u0027t kick you out,\" growled Sam[Pg 132] Pepper, walking the floor savagely. \"Go! go to-night!\" \"I will,\" answered our hero. No more was said, and the boy tied up what little clothing he had in a newspaper. He was soon ready to depart, and then he faced Pepper again. \"Good-by,\" he said, holding out his hand. \"Let us part friends.\" \"You\u0027ve missed it by turning against me,\" said Pepper, with a strange look in his eyes. \"I might have made you rich.\" \"How?\" \"Never mind now. You can go your way, and I\u0027ll go mine. I don\u0027t want to shake hands. Go!\" And he turned his back on the newsboy. \"One word more, before I leave,\" said our hero. \"Will you tell me my right name?\" \"I won\u0027t tell you anything. If Nelson Pepper aint good enough for you, you can make the name what you please.\" \"Then good-by,\" said Nelson, a little sadly, and in a moment more he was gone. It was so late he knew not where to look for a room that night, so trudged back to the stand. It was entirely inclosed with wooden shutters, and large enough inside for him to make himself fairly comfortable, and there he remained until daylight. [Pg 133] \"I\u0027m glad to hear you\u0027ve left Pepper,\" said George Van Pelt, when he heard the news. \"He\u0027s a bad fellow, and getting worse. If you want, you can get a room in the house next to where I live.\" \"What will they charge me?\" \"You can get a small, but clean, hall bedroom for a dollar a week.\" \"That will just suit me,\" answered our hero. The place was but three blocks away from the stand, and Nelson made the necessary arrangements that afternoon, during the time when trade was dull. Nelson wondered what Pepper had meant by saying he had missed it in turning against the man. Did Pepper refer to the past, or did he have in mind what he could leave when he died? \"I don\u0027t want a cent of his money,\" our hero told himself; \"but I would like to solve the mystery of my birth and parentage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2991/82501.html","bookId":321,"book":{"id":321,"title":"Nelson The Newsboy Or, Afloat in New York","description":"简介： Nelson the Newsboy relates the adventures of a wide-awake lad in the great metropolis.
