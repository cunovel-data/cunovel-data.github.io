{"id":21770,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. NELSON ON SHIPBOARD.","content":"Nelson was tending the stand on the morning following the conversation just recorded, when suddenly Paul Randall came running up, all out of breath. \"I just saw Billy Darnley,\" gasped the little newsboy, when able to speak. \"Where did you see him?\" questioned Nelson quickly. \"Right straight across town, on the East River. He was talking to the captain of a big schooner named the Victory. I guess he was wanting to ship in her.\" \"Tend the stand, Paul, and I\u0027ll go after him,\" said Nelson, and leaped outside. Soon he was making his way toward the East River with all possible speed. When he came in sight of the docks half a dozen vessels met his view, all with their bows stuck far over into the street. Of a sailor standing near he asked which was the Victory. [Pg 199] \"There she is,\" answered the tar, pointing with his sunburnt hand. \"Want to ship?\" \"Not much!\" laughed Nelson. \"I want to keep another fellow from shipping.\" \"Then you\u0027ll have to hurry, for the Victory is going to sail putty quick.\" Nelson was soon picking his way across the dock where the big schooner lay. Merchandise was on every hand, and on turning a pile of this he suddenly found himself face to face with Billy Darnley and a burly man dressed in a sea suit. \"So I\u0027ve got you at last, have I?\" cried Nelson, as he grasped Darnley by the arm. \"Lemme go!\" howled the bully, in great alarm. \"Lemme go, Nelson!\" \"Not much! I\u0027m going to hand you over to the police,\" was Nelson\u0027s firm answer. \"I won\u0027t go!\" \"What\u0027s the trouble?\" demanded the nautical-looking man curiously. \"He\u0027s a thief, that\u0027s the trouble,\" answered our hero. \"It aint so. I never stole nuthin\u0027 in my life,\" retorted Darnley sulkily. \"He\u0027s down on me, and he\u0027s always tryin\u0027 to git me into trouble.\" \"I am telling the truth,\" said Nelson. \"He\u0027s got to go with me.\" \"I won\u0027t go!\" roared the bully. [Pg 200] For a moment the face of the seafaring man was a study. His name was Grabon, and he was part owner and captain of the Victory. \"Darnley has signed articles with me, for a trip to the West Indies and Brazil,\" he said. \"Well, he can\u0027t go to the West Indies and Brazil. He\u0027s going to the lock-up,\" returned Nelson firmly. \"What is he guilty of?\" \"Of two robberies, so far as I know. He once robbed me of some money, and only a short while ago he robbed a news stand belonging to me and another party.\" \"Humph! What did he rob you of—half a dozen newspapers?\" sneered Captain Grabon. \"If he did, you shan\u0027t keep him ashore on that account. I am short of hands as it is, and must sail by the tide to-day.\" \"The trouble was all over ten newspapers,\" said Billy Darnley, quick to take up an idea that had come to him. \"He says I stole \u0027em, but I didn\u0027t.\" \"I won\u0027t listen to such nonsense.\" Captain Grabon shoved Nelson back. \"Let my man go.\" \"I won\u0027t!\" exclaimed our hero. \"You will!\" put in Billy Darnley, and[Pg 201] wrenching himself free, he ran along the dock toward the Victory and clambered aboard the vessel. \"You\u0027re going to get yourself into a whole lot of trouble!\" ejaculated Nelson to the captain. \"You clear out!\" \"Not much—not until I\u0027ve caught that thief.\" As quickly as he could, our hero ran toward the ship and clambered aboard after Darnley. For the moment he had lost sight of the bully, but now he saw him peering out from behind the mainmast. At once a chase ensued. OUR HERO RAN TOWARD THE SHIP AND CLAMBERED ABOARD \"OUR HERO RAN TOWARD THE SHIP AND CLAMBERED ABOARD.\" Nelson the Newsboy. —Page 201. In the meantime Captain Grabon came on board, and going quickly to his mate, he ordered the lines flung off and the boat towed out into the stream. Around and around the deck flew Darnley, with Nelson after him. Then the bully leaped down the companion-way steps and into the cabin. Undaunted, our hero followed, and presently the pair found themselves at the end of a narrow passageway. \"Now I\u0027ve got you!\" panted Nelson. \"You shan\u0027t get away from me again.\" \"I won\u0027t go!\" howled Billy Darnley desperately. \"I\u0027m booked for this trip to sea.\" [Pg 202] \"Well, a sea trip might do you some good, Billy, but you are not going to take it just yet What did you do with the stuff you stole from the stand?\" \"Didn\u0027t steal anything from the stand.\" \"Yes, you did—you and Len Snocks. Van Pelt and I know all about it. You got to give up the goods, do you hear?\" \"I aint got nuthin,\" growled Darnley. He tried to break away again, and a hand-to-hand tussle ensued. Presently both boys went down and rolled over. As they did this Nelson\u0027s head struck an iron projection, and he was partly stunned. Before he could recover the bully was on his feet once more. \"Take that!\" roared Darnley, and gave Nelson a cruel kick in the side. A kick in the head followed, and with a groan our hero was stretched out insensible. By this time Captain Grabon was coming below to see what was going on. He met Darnley in the cabin. \"Hold on!\" he cried. \"Where are you going?\" \"On deck,\" answered the bully, but did not add that he wanted to go ashore. \"Where\u0027s the other boy?\" \"I knocked him down.\" [Pg 203] Darnley was about to move on, but the captain would not allow it. \"You stay here for the present,\" he said. \"I want to investigate this.\" \"I\u0027m going on deck,\" growled the bully. \"What!\" roared the captain. \"Why, you monkey, don\u0027t you know you are now under my orders?\" At this Darnley fell back, aghast. \"Under your orders?\" \"Certainly. And you mind me, or I\u0027ll have you rope-ended well.\" Still holding fast to Darnley, he forced his way to the narrow passage, and here saw Nelson still lying motionless. He gave a low whistle. \"So this is your game,\" he said. \"You must have hit him hard.\" \"I did,\" answered the bully, telling the falsehood without an effort. \"This may be serious. Help me carry him into the cabin.\" Alarmed, Darnley did as requested, and our hero was placed on a lounge. There was a big lump on Nelson\u0027s forehead, and this the captain made Darnley bathe with some water from an ice-cooler in the corner. It was nearly an hour before our hero came to his senses, for the kicks from the bully had[Pg 204] been severe. He sat up, completely bewildered. \"Where am I?\" was the first question he asked himself. Then he stared around him, to behold a negro sitting near, reading a newspaper. \"Hullo!\" he said feebly. \"What place is this?\" \"Dis am de fo\u0027castle of de Victory,\" was the negro\u0027s reply. \"The fo\u0027castle of the Victory?\" repeated Nelson, puzzled. \"Where—who placed me here? And who put this rag on my head?\" \"Cap\u0027n Grabon had you carried here. You had a row wid one of de new hands. Don\u0027t you remember dat?\" \"Certainly I remember it,\" answered Nelson, and sat up. His head ached severely. \"Who are you?\" \"My name am Puff Brown. I\u0027s de cook ob de boat.\" \"Oh! And where is Billy Darnley?\" \"De feller you had de fight wid?\" \"Yes.\" \"He\u0027s on deck, learnin\u0027 how to become a sailor.\" \"I want him arrested. He\u0027s a thief.\" So speaking, Nelson staggered to his feet and[Pg 205] made for the doorway of the forecastle. When he got on deck he stared around him in amazement. The dock had been left behind, and around the ship were the blue waters of New York Bay. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2991/82511.html","bookId":321,"book":{"id":321,"title":"Nelson The Newsboy Or, Afloat in New York","description":"简介： Nelson the Newsboy relates the adventures of a wide-awake lad in the great metropolis.
