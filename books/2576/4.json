{"id":93648,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"CHAPTER THREE\\n\\n 1.\\n\\n At some time a little past two A.M. on the morning of October 30, 1970, the telephone began to ring in the downstairs hall of a small house about a hundred and fifty miles south of Cleaves Mills.\\n\\n Herb Smith sat up in bed, disoriented, dragged half-way across the threshold of sleep and left in its doorway, groggy and disoriented.\\n\\n Vera\u0027s voice beside him, muffled by the pillow. \u0027Phone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 he said, and swung out of bed. He was a big, broad-shouldered man in his late forties, losing his hair, now dressed in blue pajama bottoms. He went out into the upstairs hall and turned on the light. Down below, the phone shrilled away.\\n\\n He went down to what Vera liked to call \u0027the phone nook.\u0027 It consisted of the phone and a strange little desk-table that she had gotten with Green Stamps about three years ago. Herb had refused from the first to slide his two hundred and forty pound bulk into it. When he talked on the phone, he stood up. The drawer of the desk-table was full of Upper Rooms, Reader\u0027s Digests, and Fate magazines.\\n\\n Herb reached for the phone, then let it ring again.\\n\\n A phone call in the middle of the night usually meant one of three things: an old friend had gotten totally shitfaced and had decided you\u0027d be glad to hear from him even at two in the morning; a wrong number; bad news.\\n\\n Hoping for the middle choice, Herb lifted up the phone. \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n A crisp male voice said: \u0027Is this the Herbert Smith residence?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To whom am I speaking, please?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Herb Smith. What...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you hold for a moment?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but who. -\\n\\n Too late. There was a faint clunk in his ear, as if the party on the other end had dropped one of his shoes. He had been put on hold. Of the many things he disliked about the telephone - bad connections, kid pranksters who wanted to know if you had Prince Albert in a can, operators who sounded like computers, and smoothies who wanted you to buy magazine subscriptions - the thing he disliked the most was being on hold. It was one of those insidious things that had crept into modern life almost unnoticed over the last ten years or so. Once upon a time the fellow on the other end would simply have said, \u0027Hold the phone, willya?\u0027 and set it down. At least in those days you were able to hear faraway conversations, a barking dog, a radio, a crying baby. Being on hold was a totally different proposition. The line was darkly, smoothly blank. You were nowhere. Why didn\u0027t they just say, \u0027Will you hold on while I bury you alive for a little while?\u0027\\n\\n He realized he was just a tiny bit scared.\\n\\n \u0027Herbert?\u0027\\n\\n He turned round, the phone to his ear. Vera was at the top of the stairs in her faded brown bathrobe, hair up in curlers, some sort of cream hardened to a castlike consistency on her cheeks and forehead.\\n\\n \u0027Who is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know yet. They\u0027ve got me on hold.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027On hold? At quarter past two in the morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not Johnny, is it? Nothing\u0027s happened to Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said, struggling to keep his voice from rising. Somebody calls you at two in the morning, puts you on hold, you count your relatives and inventory their condition. You make lists of old aunts. You tot up the ailments of grandparents, if you still have them. You wonder if the ticker of one of your friends just stopped ticking. And you try not to think that you have one son you love very much, or about how these calls always seem to come at two in the morning, or how all of a sudden your calves are getting stiff and heavy with tension...\\n\\n Vera had closed her eyes and had folded her hands in the middle of her thin bosom. Herb tried to control his irritation. Restrained himself from saying, \u0027Vera, the Bible makes the strong suggestion that you go and do that in your closet.\u0027 That would earn him Vera Smith\u0027s Sweet Smile for Unbelieving and Hellbound Husbands. At two o\u0027clock in the morning, and on hold to boot, he didn\u0027t think he could take that particular smile.\\n\\n The phone clunked again and a different male voice, an older one, said, \u0027Hello, Mr. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, who is this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry to have kept you waiting, sir. Sergeant Meggs of the state police, Orono branch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it my boy? Something about my boy?\u0027\\n\\n Unaware, he sagged onto the seat of the phone nook. He felt weak all over.\\n\\n Sergeant Meggs said, \u0027Do you have a son named John Smith, no middle initial?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is he all right? Is he okay?\u0027\\n\\n Footsteps on the stairs. Vera stood beside him. For a moment she looked calm, and then she clawed for the phone like a tigress. \u0027What is it? What\u0027s happened to my Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n Herb yanked the handset away from her, splintering one of her fingernails. Staring at her hard he said, \u0027I am handling this.\u0027\\n\\n She stood looking at him, her mild, faded blue eyes wide above the hand clapped to her mouth.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith, are you there?\u0027\\n\\n Words that seemed coated with novocaine fell from Herb\u0027s mouth. \u0027I have a son named John Smith, no middle initial, yes. He lives in Cleaves Mills. He\u0027s a teacher at the high school there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s been in a car accident, Mr. Smith. His condition is extremely grave. I\u0027m very sorry to have to give you this news.\u0027 The voice of Meggs was cadenced, formal.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, my God,\u0027 Herb. said. His thoughts were whirling. Once, in the army, a great, mean, blond-haired Southern boy named Childress had beaten the crap out of him behind an Atlanta bar. Herb had felt like this then, unmanned, all his thoughts knocked into a useless, smeary sprawl. \u0027Oh, my God,\u0027 he said again.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s dead?\u0027 Vera asked. \u0027He\u0027s dead? Johnny\u0027s dead?\u0027\\n\\n He covered the mouthpiece. \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027Not dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not dead! Not dead!\u0027 she cried, and fell on her knees in the phone nook with an audible thud. \u00270 God we most heartily thank Thee and ask that You show Thy tender care and loving mercy to our son and shelter him with Your loving hand we ask it in the name of Thy only begotten Son Jesus and...\\n\\n \u0027Vera shut up!\u0027\\n\\n For a moment all three of them were silent, as if considering the world and its not-so-amusing ways: Herb, his bulk squashed into the phone nook bench with his knees crushed up against the underside of the desk and a bouquet of plastic flowers in his face: Vera with her knees planted on the hallway furnace grille; the unseen Sergeant Meggs was in a strange auditory way witnessing this black comedy.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.I... I apologize for the ruckus.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quite understandable,\u0027 Meggs said.\\n\\n \u0027My boy... Johnny.. was he driving his Volkswagen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Deathtraps, deathtraps, those little beetles are death-traps,\u0027 Vera babbled. Tears streamed down her face, sliding over the smooth hard surface of the nightpack like rain on chrome.\\n\\n \u0027He was in a Bangor \u0026 Orono Yellow Cab,\u0027 Meggs said. \u0027I\u0027ll give you the situation as I understand it now. There were three vehicles involved, two of them driven by kids from Cleaves Mills. They were dragging. They came up over what\u0027s known as Carson\u0027s Hill on Route 6, headed east. Your son was in the cab, headed west, toward Cleaves. The cab and the car on the wrong side of the road collided headon. The cab driver was killed, and so was the boy driving the other car. Your son and a passenger in that other car are at Eastern Maine Med. I understand both of them are listed as critical.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Critical,\u0027 Herb said.\\n\\n \u0027Critical! Critical! \u0027 Vera moaned.\\n\\n Oh, Christ, we sound like one of those weird off Broadway shows, Herb thought. He felt embarrassed for Vera, and for Sergeant Meggs, who must surely be hearing Vera, like some nutty Greek chorus in the back-ground. He wondered how many conversations like this Sergeant Meggs had held in the course of his job. He decided he must have had a good many. Possibly he had already called the cab driver\u0027s wife and the dead boy\u0027s mother to pass the news. How had they reacted? And what did it matter? Wasn\u0027t it Vera\u0027s right to weep for her son? And why did a person have to think such crazy things at a time like this?\\n\\n \u0027Eastern Maine,\u0027 Herb said. He jotted it on a pad. The drawing on top of the pad showed a smiling telephone handset. The phone cord spelled out the words PHONE PAL. \u0027How is he hurt?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I beg your pardon, Mr. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where did he get it? Head? Belly? What? Is he burned?\u0027\\n\\n Vera shrieked.\\n\\n \u0027Vera can you please shut UP!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d have to call the hospital for that information,\u0027 Meggs said carefully. \u0027I\u0027m a couple of hours from having a complete report.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right. All right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith, I\u0027m sorry to have to call you in the middle of the night with such bad news ...\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s bad, all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve got to call the hospital, Sergeant Meggs. Good-bye.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good night, Mr. Smith.\u0027\\n\\n Herb hung up and stared stupidly at the phone. Just like that it happens, he thought. How \u0027bout that. Johnny.\\n\\n Vera uttered another shriek, and he saw with some alarm that she had grabbed her hair, rollers and all, and was pulling it. \u0027It\u0027s a judgment! A judgment on the way we live, on sin, on something! Herb, get down on your knees with me...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vera, I have to call the hospital. I don\u0027t want to do it on my knees.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll pray for him... promise to do better... if you\u0027d only come to church more often with me I know... may be it\u0027s your cigars, drinking beer with those men after work ... cursing... taking the name of the Lord God in vain... a judgment... it\u0027s a judgment...\u0027\\n\\n He put his hands on her face to stop its wild, uneasy whipping back and forth. The feel of the night cream was unpleasant, but he didn\u0027t take his hands away. He felt pity for her. For the last ten years his wife had been walking somewhere in a gray area between devotion to her Baptist faith and what he considered to be a mild religious mania. Five years after Johnny was born, the doctor had found a number of benign tumors in her uterus and vaginal canal. Their removal had made it impossible for her to have another baby. Five years later, more tumors had necessitated a radical hysterectomy. That was when it had really begun for her, a deep religious feeling strangely coupled with other beliefs. She avidly read pamphlets on Atlantis, spaceships from heaven, races of \u0027pure Christians\u0027 who might live in the bowels of the earth. She read Fate magazine almost as frequently as the Bible, often using one to illuminate the other.\\n\\n \u0027Vera,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll do better,\u0027 she whispered, her eyes pleading with him. \u0027We\u0027ll do better and he\u0027ll live. You\u0027ll see. You\u0027ll...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vera.\u0027\\n\\n She fell silent, looking at him.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s call the hospital and see just how bad it really is,\u0027 he said gently.\\n\\n \u0027A-All right. Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you sit on the stairs there and keep perfectly quiet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want to pray,\u0027 she said childishly. \u0027You can\u0027t stop me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to. As long as you pray to yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. To myself. All right, Herb.\u0027\\n\\n She went to the stairs and sat down and pulled her robe primly around her. She folded her hands and her lips began to move. Herb called the hospital. Two hours later they were headed north on the nearly deserted Maine Turnpike. Herb was behind the wheel of their \u002766 Ford station wagon. Vera sat bolt upright in the passenger seat. Her Bible was on her lap.\\n\\n The telephone woke Sarah at quarter of nine. She went to answer it with half her mind still asleep in bed. Her back hurt from the vomiting she had done the night before and the muscles in her stomach felt strained, but otherwise she felt much better.\\n\\n She picked up the phone, sure it would be Johnny. \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Sarah.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t Johnny. It was Anne Strafford from school. Anne was a year older than Sarah and in her second year at Cleaves. She taught Spanish. She was a bubbly, effervescent girl and Sarah liked her very much. But this morning she sounded subdued.\\n\\n \u0027How are you, Annie? It\u0027s only temporary. Probably Johnny told you. Carnival hot dogs, I guess...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, my God, you don\u0027t know. You don\u0027t ...\u0027 The words were swallowed in odd, choked sounds. Sarah listened to them, frowning. Her initial puzzlement turned to deadly disquiet as she realized Anne was crying.\\n\\n \u0027Anne? What\u0027s wrong? It\u0027s not Johnny, is it? Not...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There was an accident,\u0027 Anne said. She was now sobbing openly. \u0027He was in a cab. There was a head-on collision. The driver of the other car was Brad Freneau, I had him in Spanish II, he died, his girl friend died this morning, Mary Thibault, she was in one of Johnny\u0027s classes, I heard, it\u0027s horrible, just horr.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny!\u0027 Sarah screamed into the phone. She was sick to her stomach again. Her hands and feet were suddenly as cold as four gravestones. \u0027What about Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s in critical condition, Sarah. Dave Pelsen called the hospital this morning. He\u0027s not expected ... well, it\u0027s very bad.\u0027\\n\\n The world was going gray. Anne was still talking but her voice was far and wee, as e.e. cummings had said about the balloon man. Flocked images tumbling over and over one another, none making sense. The carny wheel. The mirror maze. Johnny\u0027s eyes, strangely violet, almost black. His dear, homely face in the harsh, county fair lighting, naked bulbs strung on electric wire.\\n\\n \u0027Not Johnny,\u0027 she said, far and wee, far and wee. \u0027You\u0027re mistaken. He was fine when he left here.\u0027\\n\\n And Anne\u0027s voice coming back like a fast serve, her voice so shocked and unbelieving, so affronted that such a thing should have happened to someone her own age, someone young and vital. \u0027They told Dave he\u0027d never wake up even if he survived the operation. They have to operate because his head... his head was...\u0027\\n\\n Was she going to say crushed? That Johnny\u0027s head had been crushed?\\n\\n Sarah fainted then, possibly~to avoid that final irrevocable word, that final horror. The phone spilled out of her fingers and she sat down hard in a gray world and then slipped over and the phone swung back and forth in a decreasing arc, Anne Strafford\u0027s voice coming out of it: \u0027Sarah?... Sarah? . Sarah?\u0027\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n When Sarah got to Eastern Maine Medical, it was quarter past twelve. The nurse at the reception desk looked at her white, strained face, estimated her capacity for further truth, and told her that John Smith was still in OR. She added that Johnny\u0027s mother and father were in the waiting room.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 Sarah said. She turned right instead of left, wound up in a medical closet, and had to backtrack.\\n\\n The waiting room was done in bright, solid colors that gashed her eyes A few people sat around looking at tattered magazines or empty space. A gray-haired woman came in from the elevators, gave her visitor\u0027s pass to a friend, and Sat down. The friend clicked away on high heels. The rest of them went on sitting, waiting their own chance to visit a father who had had gallstones removed, ~ mother who had discovered a small lump under one of her breasts a bare three days ago, a friend who had been struck in the chest with an invisible sledgehammer while jogging. The faces of the waiters were care fully made-up with composure. Worry was swept under the face like dirt under a rug. Sarah felt the unreality hovering again.\\n\\n Somewhere a soft bell was ringing. Crepe-soled shoes squeaked. He had been fine when he left her place. Impossible to think he was in one of these brick towers, engaged in dying.\\n\\n She knew Mr. and Mrs. Smith at once. She groped for their first names and could not immediately find them. They were sitting together near the back of the room, and unlike the others here, they hadn\u0027t yet had time to come to terms with what had happened in their lives.\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s mom sat with her coat on the chair behind her and her Bible clutched in her hands. Her lips moved as she read, and Sarah remembered Johnny saying she was very religious - maybe too religious, somewhere in that great middle ground between holy rolling and snake-handling, she remembered him saying. Mr. Smith -Herb, it came to her, his name is Herb - had one of the magazines on his knees, but he wasn\u0027t looking at it. He was looking out the window, where New England fall burned its way toward November and winter beyond.\\n\\n She went over to them. \u0027Mr. and Mrs. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n They looked up at her, their faces tensed for the dreaded blow. Mrs. Smith\u0027s hands tightened on her Bible, which was open to the Book of Job, until her knuckles were white. The young woman before them was not in nurse\u0027s or doctor\u0027s whites, but that made no difference to them at this point. They were waiting for the final blow.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, we\u0027re the Smiths,\u0027 Herb said quietly.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Sarah Bracknell. Johnny and I are good friends. Going together, I suppose you\u0027d say. May I sit down?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Johnny\u0027s girl friend?\u0027 Mrs. Smith asked in a sharp, almost accusing tone. A few of the others looked around briefly and then back at their own tattered magazines.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027Johnny\u0027s girl.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He never wrote that he had a lady friend,\u0027 Mrs. Smith said in that same sharp tone. \u0027No, he never did at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hush, Mother,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Sit down, Miss . -. Bracknell, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sarah,\u0027 she said gratefully, and took a chair. \u0027I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, he never did,\u0027 Mrs. Smith said sharply. \u0027My boy loved God, but just lately he maybe fell away just a bit. The judgment of the Lord God is sudden, you know. That\u0027s what makes backsliding so dangerous. You know not the day nor the hour ...\\n\\n \u0027Hush,\u0027 Herb said. People were looking around again. He fixed his wife with a stern glance. She looked back defiantly for a moment, but his gaze didn\u0027t waver. Vera dropped her eyes. She had closed the Bible but her fingers fiddled restlessly along the pages, as if longing to get back to the colossal demolition derby of Job\u0027s life, enough bad luck to put her own and her son\u0027s in some sort of bitter perspective.\\n\\n \u0027I was with him last night,\u0027 Sarah said, and that made the woman look up again, accusingly. At that moment Sarah remembered the biblical connotation of being \u0027with\u0027 somebody and felt herself beginning to blush. It was as if the woman could read her thoughts.\\n\\n \u0027We went to the county fair...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Places of sin and evil,\u0027 Vera Smith said clearly.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you one last time to hush, Vera,\u0027 Herb said grimly, and clamped one of his hands over one of his wife\u0027s. \u0027I mean it, now. This seems like a nice girl here, and I won\u0027t have you digging at her. Understand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sinful places,\u0027 Vera repeated stubbornly.\\n\\n \u0027Will you hush?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let me go. I want to read my Bible.\u0027\\n\\n He let her go. Sarah felt confused embarrassment. Vera opened her Bible and began to read again, lips moving.\\n\\n \u0027Vera is very upset, Herb said. \u0027We\u0027re both upset. You are too, from the look of you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you and Johnny have a good time last night?\u0027 he asked. \u0027At your fair?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, the lie and truth of that simple word all mixed up in her mind. \u0027Yes we did, until... well, I ate a bad hot dog or something. We had my car and Johnny drove me home to my place in Veazie. I was pretty sick to my stomach. He called a cab. He said he\u0027d call me in sick at school today. And that\u0027s the last time I saw him.\u0027 The tears started to come then and she didn\u0027t want to cry in front of them, particularly not in front of Vera Smith, but there was no way to stop it. She fumbled a Kleenex out of her purse and held it to her face.\\n\\n \u0027There, now,\u0027 Herb said, and put an arm around her.\\n\\n \u0027There, now.\u0027 She cried, and it seemed to her in some unclear way that he felt better for having someone to comfort; his wife had found her own dark brand of comfort in Job\u0027s story and it didn\u0027t include him.\\n\\n A few people turned around to gawk; through the prisms of her tears they seemed like a crowd. She had a bitter knowledge of what they were thinking: Better her than me, better all three of them than me or mine, guy must be dying, guy must have gotten his head crushed for her to cry like that. Only a matter of time before some doctor comes down and takes them into a private room to tell them that -Somehow she choked off the tears and got hold of her-self. Mrs. Smith sat bolt upright, as if startled out of a nightmare, noticing neither Sarah\u0027s tears nor her husband\u0027s effort to comfort her. She read her Bible.\\n\\n \u0027Please,\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027How bad is it? Can we hope?\u0027\\n\\n Before Herb could answer, Vera spoke up. Her voice was a dry bolt of certified doom: \u0027There\u0027s hope in God, Missy.\u0027\\n\\n Sarah saw the apprehensive flicker in Herb\u0027s eyes and thought: He thinks it\u0027s driven her crazy. And maybe it has.\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n A long afternoon stretching into evening.\\n\\n Sometime after two P.M., when the schools began to let out, a number of Johnny\u0027s students began to come in, wearing fatigue coats and strange hats and washed-out jeans. Sarah didn\u0027t see many of the kids she thought of as the button-down crowd - upward-bound, college-oriented kids, clear of eye and brow. Most of the kids who bothered to come in were the freaks and long-hairs.\\n\\n A few came over and asked Sarah in quiet tones what she knew about Mr. Smith\u0027s condition. She could only shake her head and say she had heard nothing. But one of the girls, Dawn Edwards, who had a crush on Johnny, read the depth of Sarah\u0027s fear in her face. She burst into tears. A nurse came and asked her to leave.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 Sarah said. She had a protective arm around Dawn\u0027s shoulders. \u0027Just give her a minute or two.\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to stay,\u0027 Dawn said, and left in a hurry, knocking one of the hard plastic contour chairs over with a clatter. A few moments later Sarah saw the girl sitting out on the steps in the cold, late, October sunshine with her head on her knees.\\n\\n Vera Smith read her Bible.\\n\\n By five o\u0027clock most of the students had left. Dawn had also left; Sarah had not seen her go. At seven P.M., a young man with DR. STRAWNS pinned askew to the lapel of his white coat came into the waiting room, glanced around, and walked toward them.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. and Mrs. Smith?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n Herb took a deep breath. \u0027Yes. We are.\u0027\\n\\n Vera shut her Bible with a snap.\\n\\n \u0027Would you come with me, please?\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s it, Sarah thought. The walk down to the small private room, and then the news. Whatever the news is. She would wait, and when they came back, Herb Smith would tell her what she needed to know. He was a kind man.\\n\\n \u0027Have you news of my son?\u0027 Vera asked in that same clear, strong, and nearly hysterical voice.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 Dr. Strawns glanced at Sarah. \u0027Are you family, ma\u0027am?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027A friend.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A close friend,\u0027 Herb said. A warm, strong hand closed above her elbow, just as another had closed around Vera\u0027s upper arm. He helped them both to their feet. \u0027We\u0027ll all go together, if you don\u0027t mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all.\u0027\\n\\n He led them past the elevator bank and down a hall-way to an office with CONFERENCE ROOM on the door. He let them in and turned on the overhead fluorescent lights. The room was furnished with a long table and a dozen office chairs.\\n\\n Dr. Strawns closed the door, lit a cigarette, and dropped the burned match into one of the ashtrays that marched up and down the table. \u0027This is difficult,\u0027 he said, as if to himself.\\n\\n \u0027Then you had best just say it out,\u0027 Vera said.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, perhaps I\u0027d better.\u0027\\n\\n It was not her place to ask, but Sarah could not help it. \u0027Is he dead? Please don\u0027t say he\u0027s dead...\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s in a coma.\u0027 Strawns sat down and dragged deeply on his cigarette. \u0027Mr. Smith has sustained serious head injuries and an undetermined amount of brain damage. You may have heard the phrase \"subdural hematoma\" on one or the other of the doctor shows. Mr. Smith has suffered a very grave subdural hematoma, which is localized cranial bleeding. A long operation was necessary to relieve the pressure, and also to remove bone-splinters from his brain.\u0027\\n\\n Herb sat down heavily, his face doughy and stunned. Sarah noticed his blunt, scarred hands and remembered Johnny telling her his father was a carpenter.\\n\\n \u0027But God has spared him,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027I knew he would. I prayed for a sign. Praise God, Most High! All ye here below praise His name!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vera,\u0027 Herb said with no force.\\n\\n \u0027In a coma,\u0027 Sarah repeated. She tried to fit the information into some sort of emotional frame and found it wouldn\u0027t go. That Johnny wasn\u0027t dead, that he had come through a serious and dangerous operation on his brain - those things should have renewed her hope. But they didn\u0027t. She didn\u0027t like that word coma. It had a sinister, stealthy sound. Wasn\u0027t it Latin for \u0027sleep of death\u0027?\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s ahead for him?\u0027 Herb asked.\\n\\n \u0027No one can really answer that now,\u0027 Strawns said. He began to play with his cigarette, tapping it nervously over the ashtray. Sarah had the feeling he was answering Herb\u0027s question literally while completely avoiding the question Herb had really asked. \u0027He\u0027s on life support equipment, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you must know something about his chances,\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027You must know ...\u0027 She gestured helplessly with her hands and let them drop to her sides.\\n\\n \u0027He may come out of it in forty-eight hours. Or a week. A month. He may never come out of ......... there is a strong possibility that he may die. I must tell you frankly that\u0027s the most likely. His injuries... grave.\\n\\n \u0027God wants him to live,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027I know it.\u0027\\n\\n Herb had put his face into his hands and was scrubbing it slowly.\\n\\n Dr. Strawns looked at Vera uncomfortably. \u0027I only want you to be prepared for... any eventuality.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would you rate his chances for coming out of it?\u0027 Herb asked.\\n\\n Dr. Strawns hesitated, puffed nervously on his cigarette. \u0027No, I can\u0027t do that,\u0027 he said finally.\\n\\n 5.\\n\\n The three of them waited another hour and then left. It was dark. A cold and gusty wind had come up and it whistled across the big parking lot. Sarah\u0027s long hair streamed out behind her. Later, when she got home, she would find a crisp yellow oak leaf caught in it. Overhead, the moon rode the sky, a cold sailor of the night.\\n\\n Sarah pressed a scrap of paper into Herb\u0027s hand. Written on it was her address and phone number. \u0027Would you call me if you hear something? Anything at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, of course.\u0027 He bent suddenly and kissed her cheek, and Sarah held his shoulder for a moment in the blowing dark.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m very sorry if I was stiff with you earlier, dear,\u0027 Vera said, and her voice was surprisingly gentle. \u0027I was upset.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course you were,\u0027 Sarah said.\\n\\n \u0027I thought my boy might die. But I\u0027ve prayed. I\u0027ve spoken to God about it. As the song says, \"Are we weak and heavy-laden? Cumbered with a load of care? We must never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord in \u0027prayer.\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vera, we ought to go along,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027We ought to get some sleep and see how things look in the...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But now I\u0027ve heard from my God,\u0027 Vera said, looking dreamily up at the moon. \u0027Johnny isn\u0027t going to die. It isn\u0027t in God\u0027s plan for Johnny to die. I listened and I heard that still, small voice speaking in my heart, and I am comforted.\u0027\\n\\n Herb opened the car door. \u0027Come on, Vera.\u0027\\n\\n She looked back at Sarah and smiled. In that smile Sarah suddenly saw Johnny\u0027s own easy, devil-may-care grin - but at the same time she thought it was the most ghastly smile she had ever seen in her life.\\n\\n \u0027God has put his mark on my Johnny,\u0027 Vera said, \u0027and I rejoice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good night, Mrs. Smith,\u0027 Sarah said through numb lips.\\n\\n \u0027Good night, Sarah,\u0027 Herb said. He got in and started the car. It pulled out of its space and moved across the parking lot to State Street, and Sarah realized she hadn\u0027t asked where they were staying. She guessed they might not know themselves yet.\\n\\n She turned to go to her own car and paused, struck by the river that ran behind the hospital, the Penobscot. It flowed like dark silk, and the reflected moon was caught in its center. She looked up into the sky, standing alone in the parking lot now. She looked at the moon.\\n\\n God has put his mark on my Johnny and I rejoice.\\n\\n The moon hung above her like a tawdry carnival toy, a Wheel of Fortune in the sky with the odds all slugged in favor of the house, not to mention the house numbers - zero and double zero. House numbah, house numbah,\\n\\n y\u0027all pay the house, hey-hey-hey.\\n\\n The wind blew rattling leaves around her legs. She went to her car and sat behind the wheel. She felt suddenly sure she was going to lose him. Terror and loneliness woke in her. She began to shiver. At last she started her car and drove home.\\n\\n 6.\\n\\n There was a great outpouring of comfort and good wishes from the Cleaves Mill student body in the following week; Herb Smith told her later that Johnny received better than three hundred cards. Almost all of them contamed a hesitant personal note saying they hoped Johnny would be well soon. Vera answered each of them with a thank-you note and a Bible verse.\\n\\n Sarah\u0027s discipline problem in her classes disappeared. Her previous feeling that some returning jury of class consciousness was bringing in an unfavorable verdict changed to just the opposite. Gradually she realized that the kids were viewing her as a tragic heroine, Mr. Smith\u0027s lost love. This idea struck her in the teacher\u0027s room during her free period on the Wednesday following the accident, and she went off into sudden gales of laughter that turned into a crying jag. Before she was able to get herself under control she had frightened herself badly. Her nights were made restless with incessant dreams of Johnny - Johnny in the Halloween Jekyll-and-Hyde mask, Johnny standing at the Wheel of Fortune concession while some disembodied voice chanted, \u0027Man, I love to watch this guy get a beatin,\u0027 over and over. Johnny saying, \u0027It\u0027s all right now, Sarah, everything\u0027s fine,\u0027 and then coming into the room with his head gone above the eyebrows.\\n\\n Herb and Vera Smith spent the week in the Bangor House, and Sarah saw them every afternoon at the hospital, waiting patiently for something to happen. Nothing did. Johnny lay in a room on the intensive care ward on the sixth floor, surrounded by life-support equipment, breathing with the help of a machine. Dr. Strawns had grown less hopeful. On the Friday following the accident, Herb called Sarah on the phone and told her he and Vera were going home.\\n\\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t want to,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I\u0027ve gotten her to see reason. I think.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is she all right?\u0027 Sarah asked.\\n\\n There was a long pause, long enough to make Sarah\\n\\n think she had overstepped the bounds. Then Herb said, \u0027I don\u0027t know. Or maybe I do and I just don\u0027t want to say right out that she isn\u0027t. She\u0027s always had strong ideas about religion and they got a lot stronger after her operation. Her hysterectomy. Now they\u0027ve gotten worse again. She\u0027s been talking a lot about the end of the world. She\u0027s connected Johnny\u0027s accident with the Rapture, somehow. Just before Armageddon, God is supposed to take all the faithful up to heaven in their actual bodies.\u0027\\n\\n Sarah thought of a bumper sticker she had seen somewhere: IF THE RAPTURE\u0027S TODAY, SOMEBODY GRAB MY STEERING WHEEL ! \u0027Yes, I know the idea,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 Herb said uncomfortably, \u0027some of the groups she ... she corresponds with... they believe that God is going to come for the faithful in flying saucers. Take them all up to heaven in flying saucers, that is. These ... sects ... have proved, at least to themselves, that heaven is somewhere out in the constellation of Orion. No; don\u0027t ask me how they proved it. Vera could tell you. It\u0027s ... well, Sarah, it\u0027s all a little hard on me.\\n\\n \u0027Of course it must be.\u0027\\n\\n Herb\u0027s voice strengthened. \u0027But she can still distinguish between what\u0027s real and what\u0027s not. She needs time to adjust. So I told her she could face whatever\u0027s coming at home as easily as here. I\u0027ve...\u0027 He paused, sounding embarrassed, then cleared his throat and went on. \u0027I\u0027ve got to get back to work. I\u0027ve got jobs. I\u0027ve signed contracts...\\n\\n \u0027Sure, of course.\u0027 She paused. \u0027What about insurance? I mean, this must be costing a Denver mint...\u0027 It was her turn to feel embarrassed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve talked with Mr. Pelsen, your assistant principal there at Cleaves Mills,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Johnny had the standard Blue Cross, but not that new Major Medical. The Blue Cross will cover some of it, though. And Vera and I have our savings.\u0027\\n\\n Sarah\u0027s heart sank. Vera and I have our savings. How long would one passbook stand up to expenses of two hundred dollars a day or more? And for what purpose in the end? So Johnny could hang on like an insensible animal, pissing brainlessly down a tube while he bankrupted his dad and mom? So his condition could drive his mother mad with unrealized hope? She felt the tears start to slip down her cheeks and for the first time - but not the last - she found herself wishing Johnny would die and be at peace. Part of her revolted in horror at the thought, but it remained.\\n\\n \u0027I wish you all the best,\u0027 Sarah said.\\n\\n \u0027I know that, Sarah. We wish you the best. Will you write?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I sure will.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And come see us when you can. Pownal\u0027s not so far away.\u0027 He hesitated. \u0027Looks to me like Johnny had picked himself out the right girl. It was pretty serious, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Sarah said. The tears were still coming and the past tense was not lost on her. \u0027It was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good-bye, honey.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good-bye, Herb.\u0027\\n\\n She hung up the phone, held the buttons down for a second or two, and then called the hospital and asked about Johnny. There had been no change. She thanked the intensive care nurse and walked aimlessly back and forth through the apartment. She thought about God sending out a fleet of flying saucers to pick up the faithful and buzz them off to Orion. It made as much sense as anything else about a God crazy enough to scramble John Smith\u0027s brains and put him in a coma that was probably never going to end - except in an unexpected death.\\n\\n There was a folder of freshman compositions to correct. She made herself a cup of tea and sat down to them. If there was any one moment when Sarah Bracknell picked up the reins of her post-Johnny life again, that was�� \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-4.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
