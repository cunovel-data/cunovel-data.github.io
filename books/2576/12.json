{"id":93656,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"1.\n \u0027What are you going to do?\u0027 Sam Weizak asked.\n \u0027Christ, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027How many did you say are down there?\u0027\n \u0027About eight. One of them is the northern New England AP stringer. And there are people from two of the TV stations with cameras and lights. The hospital director is quite angry with you, Johnny. He feels you have been naughty.\u0027\n \u0027Because a lady\u0027s house was going to burn down?\u0027 Johnny asked. \u0027All I can say is it must have been one frigging slow news day.\u0027\n \u0027As a matter of fact it wasn\u0027t. Ford vetoed two bills. The P.L.O. blew up a restaurant in Tel Aviv. And a police dog sniffed out four hundred pounds of marijuana at the airport.\u0027\n \u0027Then what are they doing here?\u0027 Johnny asked. When Sam had come in with the news that reporters were gathering in the lobby, his first sinking thought was what his mother might make of this. She was with his father in Pownal, making ready for her California pilgrimage, which began the following week. Neither Johnny nor his father believed the trip was a good idea, and the news that her son had somehow turned psychic might make her cancel it, but in this case Johnny was very much afraid that the cure might be the greater of two evils. Something like this could set her off for good.\n On the other hand - this thought suddenly blossomed in his mind with all the force of inspiration - it might persuade her to start taking her medicine again.\n \u0027They\u0027re here because what happened is news,\u0027 Sam said. \u0027It has all the classic ingredients.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t do anything, I just...\n \u0027You just told Eileen Magown her house was on fire and it was,\u0027 Sam said softly. \u0027Come on, Johnny, you must have known this was going to happen sooner or later.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m no publicity hound,\u0027 Johnny said grimly.\n \u0027No. I didn\u0027t mean to suggest you were. An earthquake is no publicity hound. But the reporters cover it. People want to know.\u0027\n \u0027What if I just refuse to talk to them?\u0027\n \u0027That is not much of an option,\u0027 Sam replied. \u0027They will go away and publish crazy rumors. Then, when you leave the hospital, they will fall on you. They will shove microphones in your face as if you were a senator or a crime boss, nuh?\u0027\n Johnny thought about it. \u0027Is Bright down there?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Suppose I ask him to come up? He can get the story and give it to the rest of them.\u0027\n \u0027You can do that, but it would make the rest of them extremely unhappy. And an unhappy reporter will be your enemy. Nixon made them unhappy and they tore him to pieces.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not Nixon,\u0027 Johnny said.\n Weizak grinned radiantly. \u0027Thank God,\u0027 he said. \u0027What do you suggest?\u0027 Johnny asked.\n 2.\n The reporters stood up and crowded forward when Johnny stepped through the swing doors and into the west lobby. He was wearing a white shirt, open at the collar, and a pair of blue jeans that were too big for him. His face was pale but composed. The scars from the tendon operations stoodout clearly on his neck. Flashbulbs popped warm fire at him and made him wince. Questions were babbled.\n \u0027Here! Here !\u0027 Sam Weizak shouted. \u0027This is a convalescent patient! He wants to make a brief statement and he will answer some of your questions, but only if you behave in an orderly fashion! Now fall back and let him breathe!\u0027\n Two sets of TV light bars flashed on, bathing the lobby in an unearthly glare. Doctors and nurses had gathered by the lounge doorway to watch. Johnny winced away from the lights, wondering if this was what they meant by the limelight. He felt as if all of it might be a dream.\n \u0027Who\u0027re you?\u0027 one of the reporters yelled at Weizak.\n \u0027I am Samuel Weizak, this young man\u0027s doctor, and that name is spelled with two X\u0027s.\u0027\n There was general laughter and the mood eased a little. \u0027Johnny, you feel all right?\u0027 Weizak asked. It was early evening, and his sudden insight that Eileen Magown\u0027s kitchen was catching fire seemed distant and unimportant, the memory of a memory.\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027What\u0027s your statement?\u0027 one of the reporters called.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 Johnny said, \u0027it\u0027s this. My physical therapist is a woman named Eileen Magown. She\u0027s a very nice lady, and she\u0027s been helping me get my strength back. I was in an accident, you see, and ...\u0027 One of the TV cameras moved in, goggling at him blankly, throwing him off-stride for a moment \u0027... and I got pretty weak. My muscles sort of collapsed. We were in the physical therapy room this morning, just finishing up, and I got the feeling that her house was on fire. That is, to be more specific ...\u0027 Jesus) you sound like an asshole! \u0027I felt that she had forgotten to turn off her stove and that the curtains in the kitchen were about to catch fire. So we just went and called the fire department and that\u0027s all there was to it.\u0027\n There was a moment\u0027s gaping pause as they digested that - I sort of got the feeling, and that\u0027s all there was to it - and then the barrage of questions came again, everything mixed together into a meaningless stew of human voices. Johnny looked around helplessly, feeling disoriented and vulnerable.\n \u0027One at a time!\u0027 Weizak yelled. \u0027Raise your hands! Were you never schoolchildren?\u0027\n Hands waved, and Johnny pointed at David Bright.\n \u0027Would you call this a psychic experience, Johnny?\u0027\n \u0027I would call it a feeling,\u0027 Johnny answered. \u0027I was doing situps and I finished. Miss Magown took my hand to help me up and I just knew.\u0027\n He pointed at someone else.\n \u0027Mel Allen, Portland Sunday Telegram, Mr. Smith. Was it like a picture? A picture in your head?\u0027\n \u0027No, not at all,\u0027 Johnny said, but he was not really able to remember what it had been like.\n \u0027Has this happened to you before, Johnny?\u0027 A young woman in a slacksuit asked.\n \u0027Yes, a few times.\u0027\n \u0027Can you tell us about the other incidents?\u0027\n \u0027No, I\u0027d rather not.\u0027\n One of the TV reporters raised his hand and Johnny nodded at him. \u0027Did you have any of these flashes before your accident and the resulting coma, Mr. Smith?\u0027\n Johnny hesitated.\n The room seemed very still. The TV lights were warm on his face, like a tropical sun. \u0027No,\u0027 he said.\n Another barrage of questions. Johnny looked helplessly at Weizak again.\n \u0027Stop! Stop!\u0027 He bellowed. He looked at Johnny as the roar subsided. \u0027You are done, Johnny?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll answer two more questions,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Then... really. . it\u0027s been a long day for me ... yes, Ma\u0027am?\u0027\n He was pointing to a stout woman who had wedged herself in between two young reporters. \u0027Mr. Smith,\u0027 she said in a loud, carrying, tubalike voice, \u0027who will be the Democrats\u0027 nominee for president next year?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t tell you that,\u0027 Johnny said, honestly surprised at the question. \u0027How could I tell you that?\u0027\n More hands were raised. Johnny pointed to a tall, sober-faced man in a dark suit. He took one step forward. There was something prim and coiled about him.\n \u0027Mr. Smith, I\u0027m Roger Dussault, from the Lewiston Sun, and I would like to know if you have any idea why you should have such an extraordinary ability as this ... if indeed you do. Why you, Mr. Smith?\u0027\n Johnny cleared his throat. \u0027As I understand your question ... you\u0027re asking me to justify something I don\u0027t understand. I can\u0027t do that.\u0027\n \u0027Not justify, Mr. Smith. Just explain.\u0027\n He thinks I\u0027m hoaxing them. Or trying.\n Weizak stepped up beside Johnny. \u0027I wonder if I might answer that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Or at least attempt to explain why it cannot be answered.\u0027\n \u0027Are you psychic, too?\u0027 Dussault asked coldly.\n \u0027Yes, all neurologists must be, it\u0027s a requirement,\u0027 Weizak said. There was a burst of laughter and Dussault flushed.\n \u0027Ladies and gentlemen of the press. This man spent four-and-a-half years in a coma. We who study the human brain have no idea why he did, or why he came out of it, and this is for the simple reason that we do not understand what a coma really is, any more than we understand sleep or the simple act of waking. Ladies and gentlemen, we do not understand the brain of a frog or the brain of an ant. You may quote me on these things... you see I am fearless, nuh?\u0027\n More laughter. They liked Weizak. But Dussault did not laugh.\n \u0027You may also quote me as saying I believe this man is now in possession of a very new human ability, or a very old one. Why? If I and my coleagues do not understand the brain of an ant, can I tell you why? I cannot. I can suggest some interesting things to you, however, things which may or may not have bearing. A part of John Smith\u0027s brain has been damaged beyond repair - a very small part, but all parts of the brain may be vital. He calls this his \"dead zone\", and there, apparently, a number of trace memories were stored. all of these wiped out memories seem to be part of a \"set\" that of street, road, and highway designations. A subset of a larger overall set, that of where it is. This is a small but total aphasia which seems to include both language and vizualization skills.\n \u0027Balancing this off, another tiny part of John Smith\u0027s brain appears to have awakened. A section of the cerebrum within the parietal lobe. This is one of the deeply grooved sections of the \"forward\" or \"thinking\" brain. The electrical responses from this section of Smith\u0027s brain are way out of line from what they should be, nuh? Here is one more thing. The parietal lobe has something to do with the sense of touch - how much or how little we are not completely sure - and it is very near to that area of the brain that sorts and identifies various shapes and textures. And it has been my own observation that John\u0027s \"flashes\" are always preceded by some sort of touching.\u0027\n Silence. Reporters were scribbling madly. The TV cameras, which had moved in to focus on Weizak, now pulled back to include Johnny in the picture.\n \u0027Is that it, Johnny?\u0027 Weizak asked again.\n \u0027I guess...\u0027\n Dussault suddenly shouldered his way through the knot of reporters. For a bemused moment Johnny thought he was going to join them in front of the doors, possibly for the purpose of rebuttal. Then he saw that Dussault was slipping something from around his neck.\n \u0027Let\u0027s have a demonstration,\u0027 he said. He was holding a medallion on a fine-link gold chain. \u0027Let\u0027s see what you can do with this.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll see no such thing,\u0027 Weizak said. His bushy salt-and-pepper eyebrows had drawn thunderously together and he stared down at Dussault like Moses. \u0027This man is not a carnival performer, sir!\u0027\n \u0027You sure could have fooled me,\u0027 Dussault said. \u0027Either he can or he can\u0027t, right? While you were busy suggesting things, I was busy suggesting something to myself. What I was suggesting was that these guys can never perform on demand, because they\u0027re all as genuine as a pile of three-dollar bills.\u0027\n Johnny looked at the other reporters. Except for Bright, who looked rather embarrassed, they were watching avidly. They looked like the nurses peering at him through the glass; Suddenly he felt like a Christian in a pitful of lions. They win either way, he thought. If I can tell him something, they\u0027ve got a front-page story. If I can\u0027t, or if I refuse to try, they\u0027ve got another kind of story.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Dussault asked. The medallion swung back and forth below his fist.\n Johnny looked at Weizak, but Weizak was looking away, disgusted.\n \u0027Give it to me,\u0027 Johnny said.\n Dussault handed it over. Johnny put the medallion in his palm. It was a St. Christopher medal. He dropped the fine-link chain on top of it in a crisp little yellow heap and closed his hand over it.\n Dead silence fell in the room. The handful of doctors and nurses standing by the lounge doorway had been joined by half a dozen others, some of them dressed in streetclothes and on their way out of the hospital for the night. A crowd of patients had gathered at the end of the hallway leading to the first-floor TV and game lounge. The people who had come for the regular early evening visiting hours had drifted over from the main lobby. A feeling of thick tension lay in the air like a humming power cable.\n Johnny stood silently, pale and thin in his white shirt and oversized blue jeans. The St. Christopher medal was clamped so tightly in his right hand that the cords in his wrist stood out dearly in the glare of the TV light bars. In front of him, sober, impeccable, and judgmental in his dark suit, Dussault stood in the adversary position. The moment seemed to stretch out interminably. No one coughed or whispered.\n \u0027()h,\u0027 Johnny said softly ... then: \u0027Is that it?\u0027\n His fingers loosened slowly. He looked at Dussault.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Dussault asked, but the authority was suddenly gone from his voice. The tired, nervous young man who had answered the reporters\u0027 questions seemed also to be gone. There was a half-smile on Johnny\u0027s lips, but there was nothing warm about it. The blue of his eyes had darkened. They had grown cold and distant. Weizak saw and felt a chill of gooseflesh. He later told his wife that it had been the face of a man looking through a high-powered microscope and observing an interesting species of paramecium.\n \u0027It\u0027s your sister\u0027s medallion,\u0027 he said to Dussault. \u0027Her name was Anne but everyone called her Terry. Your older sister. You loved her. You almost worshiped the ground she walked on.\u0027\n Suddenly, terribly, Johnny Smith\u0027s voice began to climb and change. It became the cracked and unsure voice of an adolescent.\n \u0027It\u0027s for when you cross Lisbon Street against the lights, Terry, or when you\u0027re out parking with one of those guys from E.L. Don\u0027t forget, Terry... don\u0027t forget...\u0027\n The plump woman who had asked Johnny who the Democrats would nominate next year uttered a frightened little moan. One of the TV cameramen muttered \u0027Holy Jesus!\u0027 in a hoarse voice.\n \u0027Stop it,\u0027 Dessault whispered. His face had gone a sick shade of gray. His eyes bulged and spittle shone like chrome on his lower lip in this harsh light. His hands moved for the medallion, which was now looped on its fine gold chain over Johnny\u0027s fingers. But his hands moved with no power or authority. The medallion swung back and forth, throwing off hypnotic gleams of light.\n \u0027Remember me, Terry,\u0027 the adolescent voice begged. \u0027Stay clean, Terry.. . please, for God\u0027s sake stay clean...\u0027\n \u0027Stop it! Stop it, you bastard!\u0027\n Now Johnny spoke in his own voice again. \u0027It was speed, wasn\u0027t it? Then meth. She died of a heart attack at twenty-seven. But she wore it ten years, Rog. She remembered you. She never forgot. Never forgot ... never\n never. .. never.\u0027\n The medallion slipped from his fingers and struck the floor with a small, musical sound. Johnny stared away into emptiness for a moment, his face calm and cool and distant. Dussault grubbed at his feet for the medallion, sobbing hoarsely in the stunned silence.\n A flashbulb popped, and Johnny\u0027s face cleared and became his own again. Horror touched it, and then pity. He knelt clumsily beside Dussault.\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean ...\n \u0027You cheapjack, bastard hoaxer!\u0027 Dussault screamed at him. \u0027It\u0027s a lie! All a lie! All a lie!\u0027 He struck Johnny a clumsy, open-handed blow on the neck and Johnny fell over, striking his head on the floor, hard. He saw stars.\n Uproar.\n He was dimly aware that Dussault was pushing his way blindly through the crowd and toward the doors. People milled around Dussault, around Johnny. He saw Dussault through a forest of legs and shoes. Then Weizak was beside him, helping him to sit up.\n \u0027John, are you all right? Did he hurt you?\u0027\n \u0027Not as bad as I hurt him. I\u0027m okay.\u0027 He struggled to his feet. Hands - maybe Weizak\u0027s, maybe someone else\u0027s -helped him. He felt dizzy and sick; almost revolted. This had been a mistake, a terrible mistake.\n Someone screamed piercingly - the stout woman who had asked about the Democrats. Johnny saw Dussault pitch forward to his knees, grope at the sleeve of the stout woman\u0027s print blouse and then slide tiredly forward onto the tile near the doorway he had been trying to reach. The St. Christopher medal was still in one hand.\n \u0027Fainted,\u0027 someone said. \u0027Fainted dead away. I\u0027ll be damned.\u0027\n \u0027My fault,\u0027 Johnny said to Sam Weizak. His throat felt close and tight with shame, with tears. \u0027All my fault.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Sam said. \u0027No, John.\u0027\n But it was. He shook loose of Weizak\u0027s hands and went to where Dussault lay, coming around now, eyes blinking dazedly at the ceiling. Two of the doctors had come over to where he lay.\n \u0027Is he all right?\u0027 Johnny asked. He turned toward the woman reporter in the slacksuit and she shrank away from him. A cramp of fear passed over her face.\n Johnny turned the other way, toward the TV reporter who had asked him if he\u0027d had any flashes before his accident. It suddenly seemed very important that he explained to someone. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to hurt him,\u0027 he said. \u0027Honest to God, I never meant to hurt him. I didn\u0027t know ...\n The TV reporter backed up a step. \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027Of course you didn\u0027t. He was asking for it, anybody could see that. Just... don\u0027t touch me, huh?\u0027\n Johnny looked at him dumbly, lips quivering. He was still in shock but beginning to understand. Oh yes. He was beginning to understand. The TV reporter tried to smile and could only produce a death\u0027s-head rictus.\n \u0027Just don\u0027t touch me, Johnny. Please.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not like that,\u0027 Johnny said - or tried to. Later, he was never sure if any sound had come out.\n \u0027Don\u0027t touch me, Johnny, okay?\u0027\n The reporter backed up to where his cameraman was packing his gear. Johnny stood and watched him. He began to shake all over.\n 3.\n \u0027It\u0027s for your own good, John,\u0027 Weizak said. The nurse stood behind him, a white ghost, a sorcerer\u0027s apprentice with her hands hovering above the small, wheeled medication table, a junkie\u0027s paradise of sweet dreams.\n \u0027No,\u0027 Johnny said. He was still shaking, and now there was cold sweat as well. \u0027No more shots. I\u0027ve had it up to here with shots.\u0027\n \u0027A pill, then.\u0027\n \u0027No more pills, either.\u0027\n \u0027To help you sleep.\u0027\n \u0027Will he be able to sleep? That man Dussault?\u0027\n \u0027He asked for it,\u0027 the nurse murmured, and then flinched as Weizak turned toward her. But Weizak smiled crookedly.\n \u0027She is right, nuh?\u0027 he said. \u0027The man asked for it. He thought you were selling empty bottles, John. A good night\u0027s sleep and you\u0027ll be able to put this in perspective.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll sleep on my own.\u0027\n \u0027Johnny, please.\u0027\n It was quarter past eleven. The TV across the room had just gone off. Johnny and Sam had watched the filmed story together; it had been second-lined right after the bills Ford had vetoed. My own story made better theater, Johnny thought with morbid amusement. Film footage of a bald-headed Republican mouthing platitudes about the national budget just didn\u0027t compare with the film clip that WABI camera man had gotten here earlier this evening. The clip had ended with Dussault plunging across the floor with his sister\u0027s medal clutched in his hand and then crashing down in a faint, clutching at the woman reporter the way a drowning man might clutch at a straw.\n When the TV anchorman went on to the police dog and the four hundred pounds of pot, Weizak had left briefly and had come back with the news that the hospital switchboard had jammed up with calls for him even before the report was over. The nurse with the medication had shown up a few minutes later, leading Johnny to believe that Sam had gone down to the nurses\u0027 station to do more than check on incoming calls.\n At that instant, the telephone rang.\n Weizak swore softly under his breath. \u0027I told them to hold them all. Don\u0027t answer it, John, I\u0027ll...\n But Johnny already had it. He listened for a moment, then nodded. \u0027Yes, that was right.\u0027 He put a hand over the receiver. \u0027It\u0027s my dad,\u0027 he said. He uncovered the receiver. \u0027Hi, Dad. I guess you ...\u0027 He listened. The small smile on his lips faded and was replaced by an expression of dawning horror. His lips moved silently.\n \u0027John, what is it?\u0027 Weizak asked sharply.\n \u0027All right, Daddy,\u0027 Johnny said, almost in a whisper. \u0027Yes. Cumberland General. I know where it is. Just above Jerusalem\u0027s Lot. Okay. All right Daddy...\n His voice broke. His eyes were tearless but glistening.\n \u0027I know that, Daddy. I love you too. I\u0027m sorry.\n Listened.\n \u0027Yes. Yes it was,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I\u0027ll see you, Daddy. Yes. Good-bye.\u0027\n He hung up the phone, put the heels of his hands to his eyes, and pressed.\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027 Sam leaned forward, took one of his hands away and held it gently. \u0027Is it your mother?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah. It\u0027s my mother.\u0027\n \u0027Heart attack?\u0027\n \u0027Stroke,\u0027 Johnny said, and Sam Weizak made a small, pained hissing between his teeth. \u0027They were watching the TV news ... neither of them had any idea ... and I came on... and she had a stroke. Christ. She\u0027s in the hospital. Now if something happens to my dad, we got a triple play.\u0027 He uttered a high scream of laughter. His eyes rolled wildly from Sam to the nurse and back to Sam again. \u0027It\u0027s a good talent,\u0027 he said. \u0027Everybody should have it.\u0027 The laugh came again, so like a scream.\n \u0027How bad is she?\u0027 Sam asked.\n \u0027He doesn\u0027t know.\u0027 Johnny swung his legs out of bed. He had changed back to a hospital gown and his feet were bare.\n \u0027What do you think you are doing?\u0027 Sam asked sharply.\n \u0027What does it look like?\u0027\n Johnny got up, and for a moment it seemed that Sam would push him hack onto the bed. But he only watched Johnny limp over to the closet. \u0027Don\u0027t be ridiculous. You\u0027re not ready for this, John.\u0027\n Unmindful of the nurse - they had seen his bare tail enough times, God knew Johnny let the gown drop around his feet. The thick, twisting scars stood out on the backs of his knees and dimpled into the scant swell of his calves. He began to rummage in the closet for clothes, and came up with the white shirt and jeans he had worn to the news conference.\n \u0027John, I absolutely forbid this. As your doctor and your friend- I tell you, it is madness.\u0027\n \u0027Forbid all you want, I\u0027m going,\u0027 Johnny said. He began to dress. His face wore that expression of distant preoccupation that Sam associated with his trances. The nurse gawped.\n \u0027Nurse, you might as well go back to your station,\u0027 Sam said.\n She backed to the door, stood there for a moment, and then left. Reluctantly.\n \u0027Johnny,\u0027 Sam said. He got up, went to him, and put a hand on his shoulder. \u0027You didn\u0027t do it.\u0027\n Johnny shook the hand off. \u0027I did it, all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027She was watching me when it happened.\u0027 He began to button the shirt.\n \u0027You urged her to take her medicine and she stopped.\u0027\n Johnny looked at Weizak for a moment and then went back to buttoning his shirt.\n \u0027If it hadn\u0027t happened tonight, it would have happened tomorrow, next week, next month...\n \u0027Or next year. Or in ten years.\n \u0027No. It would not have been ten years. or even one. And you know it. Why are you so anxious to pin this tail on yourself? Because of that smug reporter? Is it maybe an inverted kind of self-pity? An urge to believe that you have been cursed?\u0027\n Johnny\u0027s face twisted. \u0027She was watching me when it happened. Don\u0027t you get that? Are you so fucking soft you don\u0027t get that?\u0027\n \u0027She was planning a strenuous trip, all the way to California and back, you told me that yourself. A symposium of some kind. A highly emotional sort of thing, from what you have said. Yes? Yes. It would almost certainly have happened then. A stroke is not lightning from a blue sky, Johnny.\u0027\n Johnny buttoned the jeans and then sat down as if the act of dressing had tired him out too much to do more. His feet were still bare. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yeah, you may be right.\u0027\n \u0027Sense! He sees sense! Thank the Lord!\u0027\n \u0027But I still have to go, Sam.\u0027\n Weizak threw up his hands. \u0027And do what? She is in the hands of her doctors and her God. That is the situation. Better than anyone else, you must understand.\u0027\n \u0027My dad will need me,\u0027 Johnny said softly. \u0027I understand that, too.\u0027\n \u0027How will you go? It\u0027s nearly midnight.\u0027\n \u0027By bus. I\u0027ll grab a cab over to Peter\u0027s Candlelighter. The Greyhounds still stop there, don\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t have to do that,\u0027 Sam said.\n Johnny was groping under the chair for his shoes and not finding them, Sam got them from under the bed and handed them to him.\n \u0027I\u0027ll drive you down.\u0027\n Johnny looked up at him. \u0027You\u0027d do that?\u0027\n \u0027If you\u0027ll take a mild tranquilizer, yes.\n \u0027But your wife ...\u0027 He realized in a confused sort of way that the only concrete thing he knew about Weizak\u0027s personal life was that his mother was living in California.\n \u0027I am divorced,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027A doctor has to be out at all hours of the night ... unless he is a pediatrist or a dermatologist, nub? My wife saw the bed as half-empty rather than half-full. So she filled it with a variety of men.\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Johnny said, embarrassed.\n \u0027You spend far too much time being sorry, John.\u0027 Sam\u0027s face was gentle, but his eyes were stern. \u0027Put on your shoes.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-12.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: \n Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
